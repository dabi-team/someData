Abstract– Direct imaging and spectroscopy is the likely means by which we will someday
identify, conﬁrm, and characterize an Earth-like planet around a nearby Sun-like star. This Chapter
summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding discovering and characterizing exoplanets
by direct imaging and spectroscopy. We detail instruments and software needed for direct imaging
detections and summarize the current inventory of conﬁrmed and candidate directly-imaged
exoplanets. Direct imaging and spectroscopy in the past decade has provided key insights into
jovian planet atmospheres, probed the demographics of the outskirts of planetary systems, and
shed light on gas giant planet formation. We forecast the new tools and future facilities on the
ground and in space that will enhance our capabilities for exoplanet imaging and will likely image
habitable zone rocky planets around the nearest stars.

Introduction

Identifying, conﬁrming, and characterizing an Earth-like
planet around a nearby Sun-like star is a key goal of exo-
planet science. In the coming decades, direct imaging and
spectroscopy are the likely means by which this goal will
be achieved.

Over 5000 extrasolar planets and candidates have been
detected through indirect means. In contrast, 20–25 exo-
planets have been directly imaged (e.g. Marois et al. 2008b;
Lagrange et al. 2010, see Fig. 1). Despite this relatively low
yield of discoveries, direct imaging comprises a large frac-
tion of the known exoplanet population amenable to atmo-
spheric characterization, since the method provides photons

from the planets themselves instead of just inferring their
presence (e.g. Currie et al. 2011; Konopacky et al. 2013).

Almost all of the directly imaged planets known thus
far are young, self-luminous gas giants detected in thermal
emission. They represent the extremes of planet formation
(Nielsen et al. 2019; Vigan et al. 2021): planets with masses
of 2 MJ or more orbiting at moderate to wide separations
(∼10–250 au). A subset of directly detected planets appear
to be in or just ﬁnished with the ﬁnal stages of assembly
(“protoplanets”) (Keppler et al. 2018). The direct imaging
ﬁeld currently also provides key insights into jovian planet
formation and the demographics of the outskirts of plane-
tary systems.

Remarkably, the direct imaging method enables the ac-

ten in 2007 (Beuzit et al. 2007), before the ﬁrst incontro-
vertible exoplanet imaging detections: superjovian planets
around HR 8799 and β Pic (Marois et al. 2008b, 2010b;
Lagrange et al. 2010). Previous reviews from Traub and
Oppenheimer (2010) and Bowler (2016) bracket the start
and end of the era of direct imaging surveys with facil-
ity, conventional AO systems. Now, >5 years later, the
ﬁrst generation of extreme AO surveys have ended, bring-
ing new discoveries, fundamentally new insights into atmo-
spheric properties of individual systems and imaged planet
demographics, motivating substantially more powerful in-
strumentation and tangible plans for directly detecting true
solar system analogues, including Earths.

In Section 2, we outline key direct imaging
as follows.
instrumentation and methods, describing the challenges in
achieving planet detections by direct imaging, and detailing
critical, novel hardware and software needed to image plan-
ets. Section 3 summarizes our current inventory of directly
imaged exoplanets, discusses challenges with interpreting
direct imaging detections, and outlines synergies with other
detection techniques. Section 4 focuses on atmospheric
characterization of exoplanets by direct imaging and spec-
troscopy, using other substellar objects (i.e. brown dwarfs)
as anchors to provide empirical constraints on exoplanet at-
mospheres and employing atmospheric models to infer in-
trinsic properties, including clouds, chemistry, and gravity.
Next we overview the architecture of directly imaged plane-
tary systems gleaned from astrometric monitoring, dynam-
ical models, and planet-disk interactions (Section 5). Sec-
tion 6 summarizes recent direct imaging surveys, the oc-
currence rates and demographics derived from them, and
what these results mean for models of jovian planet for-
mation. Finally, in Section 7 we forecast the future of di-
rect imaging, describing how technological innovations and
new, vastly more powerful facilities may provide humanity
with a glimpse of a habitable world for the ﬁrst time.

2. Direct Imaging Instrumentation and Methods

Direct imaging detections require separating the halo of
bright, highly structured scattered starlight from faint ex-
oplanet light. The key metric used to determine the de-
tectability of extrasolar planets is the planet-to-star contrast
the contrast
ratio at a given off-axis angular separation:
ratio needed for a detection varies with planet properties
(Sect 2.1). Critical hardware like AO – or (more generally)
wavefront control systems consisting of sensors and de-
formable mirrors – and coronagraphs sharpen and then sup-
press scattered starlight (Sect 2.2) to achieve deep raw con-
trasts. Novel observing techniques allow post-processing
algorithms to further remove residual starlight, increasing
achievable contrast ratios and thus improving planet detec-
tion capabilities (2.3).

quisition of hundreds to thousands of spectroscopic data-
points on exoplanets in a few hours of telescope time. This
wealth of information can critically constrain individual
temperature, clouds,
planet atmospheric properties – e.g.
chemistry, and gravity – as well as the atmospheric evolu-
tion of gas giants as a population.

The ﬁrst direct images and spectra of planet candidates
relied on facility, general-use adaptive optics (AO) systems
the Hubble
to deblur starlight or space telescopes (i.e.
Space Telescope) coupled with simple coronagraphs (e.g.
Chauvin et al. 2004; Kalas et al. 2008). The past decade has
seen the development, demonstration, and honing of dedi-
cated extreme AO systems coupled with advanced coron-
agraphs and sophisticated post-processing methods, allow-
ing the detection of planets that are fainter and less mas-
sive and/or located at smaller angular separations that probe
tighter orbits (e.g. Macintosh et al. 2014; Soummer et al.
2012; Mawet et al. 2012). In-development extreme AO sys-
tems and upgrades to ﬁrst-generation extreme AO systems
will provide images of many exoplanets near the ice line
(Guyon et al. 2020; Males et al. 2020). The Coronagraphic
Instrument on NASA’s Roman Space Telescope (Roman-
CGI) could provide the ﬁrst detections of mature planets
in reﬂected light (Spergel et al. 2013) (Figure 2).

Planned ground-based extremely large telescopes and
proposed space missions promise to make the discovery and
conﬁrmation of a habitable, Earth-like exoplanet around a
Sun-like star a reality within the next 25 years (e.g. Lopez-
Morales et al. 2019; Gaudi et al. 2020; The LUVOIR Team
2019; Quanz et al. 2021). These facilities will endeavor to
reveal biomarkers – e.g. water, oxygen, ozone – in individ-
ual systems. Their surveys will provide the ﬁrst assessment
of potential habitability around stars of different masses and
thus the true context for life on Earth. Technological in-
novation, atmospheric characterization, and demographic
studies of young jovian planets over the past decade pro-
vide ﬁrst, key steps towards this goal.

In this Chapter, we provide an updated description of
the state of our knowledge about detecting and characteriz-
ing exoplanets by direct imaging. The last dedicated direct

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

2.1. Detectability of Planets by Direct Imaging

2.1.1. Reﬂected Light

Even in the absence of an atmosphere to blur starlight,
an astronomical image of a point source (e.g. a distant star)
will not be a single point: its intensity distribution follows
from the Fourier transform due to the telescope pupil func-
tion. For a simple unobscured circular aperture, the image
intensity follows an Airy pattern whose values compared to
the peak intensity (Io) at angular separation ρ, effective tele-
scope aperture diameter Dtel, and wavenumber k = 2π/λ is
I = Io[ 4J1(0.5kDtelsinρ)
]2 , where J1 is the Bessel func-
tion of the ﬁrst kind of order one. The ﬁrst null of the Airy
function occurs at ∼ 1.22 λ/Dtel. The full-width at half-
maximum (FWHM) of this point source on the sky, deﬁning
the telescope diffraction limit, is given by

.

Even current telescopes in principal have the angular reso-
lution needed to image planets on solar system-like scales
orbiting nearby stars. An Earth twin orbiting at a pro-
jected separation of 1 au from a Sun-like star at 10 pc sub-
tends an angle of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1. Diffraction limited imaging with the
Hubble Space Telescope at optical wavelengths or with 8-
10m class telescopes like VLT, Subaru, and Keck at near-
infrared (IR) wavelengths is sufﬁcient to resolve objects at
Earth-Sun projected physical separations out to a distance
of 10–20 pc. However, the star’s halo light must be reduced
through hardware and software to a level sufﬁcient to make
the planet’s light detectable. The starlight suppression level
required to detect a planet by direct imaging depends on
whether the detection is in reﬂected light or thermal emis-
sion and varies with the planet angular separation, age, size,
temperature, and other properties (see Figure 2).

Fig. 2.— Contrast vs. angular separation for current and future
ground and space-based high-contrast imaging platforms vs. mea-
sured and predicted contrasts for selected directly imaged planets,

Planets reﬂect the light of the stars they orbit. At optical
wavelengths, the contrast ratio for a planet in reﬂected light
can be approximated as

Coptical,λ ∼ Ag(λ) φ(λ, α)

(cid:19)2

,

(cid:18) rp
ap

(2)

where rp is the planet radius, ap is the planet-to-star physi-
cal separation, Ag is the visible geometric albedo spectrum,
φ is the phase function as a function of α, the phase angle,
which is the angle between the star, planet, and observer
(Greco and Burrows 2015; Traub and Oppenheimer 2010).
Ag and φ depend on the planet’s atmospheric properties.
For a Lambertian phase function, valid for high albedo at-
mospheres, the phase function follows a simple relation of
φ(α) = [sin(α)+(π-α)cos(α)]/π, where φ = 1/π at maximum
elongation (α = π/2). Other potential scattering phase func-
tions include isotropic scattering and Rayleigh scattering.
The value of φ is considerably lower for Rayleigh scatter-
ing appropriate for jovian atmospheres at angles of 60–90o
(Madhusudhan and Burrows 2012).

For an exo-Jupiter and exo-Earth emitting as Lamber-
tian spheres with measured geometric albedos of 0.52 and
0.367, these contrasts at maximum elongation reduce to:

(4)

where rJ and r⊕ are the radii of Jupiter and Earth re-
spectively. At V band, a Jupiter and Earth at 10 pc will
then have apparent magnitudes of slightly greater than 27
and 29, respectively, and require starlight removal at angu-
lar separations of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 and 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 better than one part in 10−9
and 10−10, respectively. These required contrasts are well
beyond the capabilities of current ground and space-based
high-contrast imaging instruments. Thus far, exoplanet di-
rect imaging has therefore focused on the detection of ther-
mal emission from self-luminous jovian planets.

2.1.2. Thermal Emission

Like brown dwarfs, jovian planets cool and contract with
time, releasing gravitational potential energy as thermal
emission (e.g. Burrows et al. 2001). At ages of 1–10 Myr,
models for the luminosity evolution of 1–10 MJ exoplan-
ets predict temperatures of ≈ 500–3000 K and radii up of
rp ∼ 2.5–3 RJ. By 1 Gyr, these models predict that these
planets cool to temperatures T (cid:46) 500 K and contract to
Jupiter-like radii (rp ∼1–1.2 RJ)(e.g. Fig. 5 in Spiegel
and Burrows 2012). Thus, thermal emission from young
jovian exoplanets peaks at near-to-mid IR wavelengths at
the youngest ages, moving to well into the mid-IR at older
ages (Figure 3). The contrast ratio for planets in thermal

emission depends on the radius and effective temperature
of the planet and star and other properties:

,

(5)

where Fλ,p(T, X) is the thermal ﬂux from the planet as a
function of wavelength, Fλ,s(T ) is the thermal ﬂux from
the star as a function of wavelength, and X depends on the
planet’s atmospheric characteristics, such as clouds, chem-
istry, and gravity.

Fig. 3.— Contrast ratio vs. selected optical, near IR, and mid-IR
passbands for models for known directly imaged planets (β Pic b
and HR 8799 cde), models for older cooler exoplanets, and Jupiter
assuming a G2V primary in all cases. The actual planet-to-star
contrast ratios for β Pic b and HR 8799 cde are 5–10 times higher
as they orbit intrinsically brighter, hotter stars. Plot adapted and
modiﬁed from Skemer et al. (2014a). Models drawn from Currie
et al. (2011); Madhusudhan et al. (2011); Burrows et al. (2003).

Fig. 3 shows how the contrast ratios vary for various
types of exoplanets orbiting a G2V star.
In the near-IR,
young superjovian (∼10 MJ) exoplanets similar to β Pic
b and HR 8799 cde are roughly a factor of 10−3 to 10−5
fainter than a Sun-like star.
In the red optical, predicted
contrasts from these planets are 100 times larger; however,
mid-IR contrasts are a factor of 10 smaller. Jovian exoplan-
ets of similar masses around much older stars are far cooler
– another factor of 100–1000 fainter in the red optical and
near-IR – but remain bright in the mid IR. A true Jupiter
analogue emits negligible thermal emission shortward of λ
∼4–5 µm. Rocky terrestrial planets also emit thermally.
An exo-Earth analogue with Teﬀ ≈ 260 K has blackbody
emission peaking at 10 µm: its contrast ratio is ≈10−7, a
factor of ≈1000 shallower than its reﬂected light contrast.

bulence on the ground or intrinsic to an optical imaging

errors preclude the direct detection of exoplanets.
past decade, the direct imaging ﬁeld has made key strides
in wavefront control hardware and software to drastically
reduce wavefront errors and has developed sophisticated
coronagraph designs to further suppress diffracted starlight.
For ground-based imaging systems, turbulence arising
from many atmospheric layers along the path from the
star to the telescope induces changes in the optical path
length difference of starlight (Guyon 2005), blurring im-
ages. These aberrations must be corrected by an AO sys-
tem consisting of wavefront sensors and deformable mirrors
(DMs). An AO system splits incoming light from a guide
star between the science detector and a wavefront sensor
to measure and then correct – with a DM(s) – atmospheric
turbulence distorting the incoming wavefront, sharpening
starlight at the image plane.

Key terms driving the wavefront error budget for an AO
system include 1) measurement error (σm) which depends
on the noise properties of a wavefront sensor and the guide
star brightness, 2) temporal bandwidth error (σt) which de-
pends on the AO system time lag τ compared to the at-
mospheric coherence time τo, and 3) the ﬁtting error (σf )
which depends on the coherence length ro compared to the
DM actuator density. The quadrature-added sum of these
terms sets the Strehl ratio – a measure of the optical quality
of the image – and the raw contrast vs. angular separa-
tion (e.g. Tyson 1998). At the angular separations relevant
for most current planet searches (θ ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)2–1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0), wavefront
measurement error and temporal bandwidth error set the
contrast ﬂoor. Wavefront chromaticity and non-common
path aberrations due to instrument optics can also limit con-
trast (Guyon 2005; Currie et al. 2020a).

Facility, conventional AO systems were used for the ﬁrst
direct imaging searches. They typically sample and cor-
rect the incoming wavefront at frequencies of 0.2–1 kHz
and use DMs with a few hundred actuators: aberrations are
measured by standard Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors
(e.g. see Tyson 1998). These systems yielded partial cor-
rections, achieving modest Strehl ratios (SR ∼ 0.1–0.4) at
near-IR wavelengths focused on by most exoplanet imaging
searches (e.g. Lafreni`ere et al. 2007b).

The past 5-10 years have seen the deployment of nu-
merous extreme AO systems on 5-10m telescopes, which
have wavefront control loop speeds of (cid:38)1 kHz and DMs
with (cid:38)1000 actuators. Examples of extreme AO systems
include the Large Binocular Telescope Adaptive Optics sys-
tem (LBTAO), PALM-3000 on the Hale telescope at Palo-
mar Observatory, the Gemini Planet Imager on Gemini-
South, and the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exo-
planet REsearch instrument (SPHERE) at the VLT, the
Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics project
(SCExAO) on the Subaru Telescope, and MagAO-X on the
Clay telescope at the Magellan Observatory (Esposito et al.
2011; Dekany et al. 2013; Macintosh et al. 2014; Beuzit
et al. 2019; Jovanovic et al. 2015; Males et al. 2020). These

Currie, Biller, Lagrange et al.

systems obtain higher-quality AO corrections – Strehl ratios
of 0.7–0.95 at 1.6 µm – and yield a factor of 10-100 deeper
contrast at sub-arcsecond separations than conventional AO
systems (e.g Macintosh et al. 2014).

Extreme AO systems have relied on hardware develop-
ments in three key areas to operate high-performance AO
correction: detectors, deformable mirrors, and computing
hardware. Most extreme AO platforms utilize fast ultra-low
noise detectors like Electron-Multiplying Charge-Coupled
Devices (EMCCDs) to record stellar photons used for wave-
front sensing with reduced measurement errors (e.g. Jo-
vanovic et al. 2015; Beuzit et al. 2019; Males et al. 2020).
High-actuator count DMs are now available. For exam-
ple, the microelectromechnical-type DMs (MEMS) offer
unprecedented actuator density (≈10 act per square mm),
allowing for fairly compact extreme AO instruments (e.g.
Macintosh et al. 2014; Jovanovic et al. 2015; Males et al.
2020). Other systems employ adaptive secondary mirrors
(usually voice-coil DMs) whose low emissivity makes them
especially well suited for exoplanet imaging in thermal IR
(Esposito et al. 2011). High performance computing hard-
ware with low latency can handle the demanding computa-
tion requirements of fast, high order extreme AO systems.
Extreme AO systems also differ from conventional AO
systems in their optical design and system architecture.
Wavefront sensors (WFS) optimized for speed, sensitivity,
accuracy and precision such as the Pyramid wavefront sen-
sor have been adopted by many leading extreme AO sys-
tems (top panel of Figure 4, Esposito et al. 2011; Jovanovic
et al. 2015; Males et al. 2020), while the more established
Shack-Hartmann WFS approach has been upgraded with
spatial ﬁltering to improve performance. Wavefront correc-
tion is often performed in two steps: a conventional coarse
“woofer” correction is followed by a faster and more ac-
curate “tweeter” correction (e.g. Macintosh et al. 2014).
Extreme AO systems also include dedicated sensing and
control of pointing for precise co-alignment of the star and
coronagraph mask (Singh et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2017; Huby
et al. 2017), which is essential to maintain high contrast,
especially at the smallest angular separations.

Advances in wavefront control algorithms are also en-
abling signiﬁcant improvements in high-contrast imaging
performance. Recent advances include predictive control
and sensor fusion. These and other new software/hardware
advances are described in Section 7.1.

2.2.2. Optical Starlight Suppression

Starlight suppression is primarily performed by dedi-
cated coronagraph optics: phase and amplitude masks de-
ployed in the beam to remove starlight while preserving
planet light. These optical elements include occulters in
the image plane to directly block out on-axis starlight, as
well as optical elements in the pupil plane to manage the
telescope diffraction pattern. Many coronagraph designs
and approaches are available (e.g. Kuchner and Traub 2002;
Kasdin et al. 2003; Sivaramakrishnan et al. 2005; Guyon

et al. 2006; Kenworthy et al. 2007; Mawet et al. 2010; Ot-
ten et al. 2017), providing a wide range of performance
characteristics. For example, the well-established conven-
tional Lyot coronagraph combines an occulter in the image
plane with a Lyot stop in the pupil plane to deliver robust
performance at moderate contrast and large angular separa-
tions. Phase-mask coronagraphs or interferometric designs
(e.g.
the vector vortex coronagraph) can be highly opti-
mized for deep contrast at small inner working angles (Fig-
ure 4, bottom panel). The highest-performing coronagraphs
are also the most demanding in terms of wavefront qual-
ity and stability. Consequently, extreme AO systems ﬁrst
adopted Lyot coronagraphs, while more recent systems or
upgrades deploy higher performance solutions as the corre-
sponding wavefront quality improves.

Wavefront control is also becoming an important com-
ponent of starlight suppression in the form of speckle con-

trol.
In speckle control, a feedback loop from the post-
coronagraph image to an upstream deformable mirror al-
lows for residual speckles to be measured and canceled.
This approach has been used in laboratory testbed to reach
deep contrast levels (10−7–10−10) in support of future
space-based missions. Deployment on ground-based sys-
tems remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of at-
mospheric turbulence, but has been successful in removing
a fraction of static and slow speckles (Codona and Kenwor-
thy 2013; Martinache et al. 2016; Gerard et al. 2018; Bos
et al. 2021). Sensing and compensation of non-common
path aberrations can also be performed using a dedicated
a Zernike phase-mask sensor (Vigan et al.
sensor, e.g.
2019).

2.3. Observing, Post-Processing, and Spectral Extrac-

tion Methods

At sub-arcsecond separations,

the raw (instrument-
delivered) planet-to-star contrasts obtained by the ﬁrst gen-
eration of facility and now extreme AO systems – 10−3–
10−4.5 – are still too shallow to yield decisive detections
of many young jovian exoplanets. Residual quasi-static
speckle noise, due to nanometer-scale imperfections in
telescope optics, thermal ﬂexure, etc., limits instrumen-
tal contrasts and fails to simply average out over time like
photon (“white”) noise (Hinkley et al. 2007). Speckle noise
statistics follow a modiﬁed Rician distribution whose long
positive tail can lead to many false positives (Marois et al.
2008a; Soummer et al. 2007). Therefore, novel observing
techniques coupled with advanced post-processing methods
are critical to optimizing our ability to image exoplanets by
further suppressing stellar halo light by orders of magnitude
and making residual noise more Gaussian (“whitening”).

Various forms of differential imaging techniques are uti-
lized to remove speckle noise for direct imaging. Com-
monly used techniques include:

• Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) (Marois et al.
2006) – ADI exploits the quasi-static nature of resid-
ual speckle noise in AO corrected high-contrast im-
ages from the ground and diffraction-limited imaging
from space. For ground-based AO imaging, quasi-
static speckles evolve on a characteristic timescale
of ∼ 10s of minutes to an hour or more (Hinkley
et al. 2007). For space-based imaging, PSF breathing
due to thermal variations and other small mechani-
cal changes cause the quasi-static halo to evolve, but
the halo for a given target can remain well corre-
lated for months or years. By turning off the instru-
ment rotator that keeps north ﬁxed on the detector (on
the ground) or obtaining observations at different roll
angles (space), astrophysical objects off-axis from a
star change position angle on the detector while the
speckle halo remains ﬁxed. Subtracting images ob-
tained in an ADI sequence can then suppress speckle
noise without fully suppressing planet signals.

ADI efﬁciently suppresses speckles on the ground

and in space (Marois et al. 2006).
It is the most
widely used observing method in direct imaging.
ADI’s advantages are most limited at small angular
separations where the displacement of the planet’s
PSF is smallest for a given parallactic angle change or
roll angle change. Typically, ADI induces signal loss,
which must be corrected to achieve absolute spec-
trophotometric calibration for planets (see below).

• Spectral Differential Imaging (SDI) (Marois et al.
2000; Sparks and Ford 2002; Biller et al. 2004) – At
raw contrasts shallower than the 10−7 levels needed
to image self-luminous jovian exoplanets, achromatic
phase errors dominate the wavefront errors respon-
sible for the speckle halo (e.g. Shaklan and Green
2006; Bailey et al. 2018). For data obtained simulta-
neously at multiple wavelengths – e.g. dual-channel
imaging or an integral ﬁeld spectrograph (IFS) – the
speckle halo as a function of wavelength, scaled in ra-
dius by the central passband wavelength, is extremely
well correlated. Since the images at different wave-
lengths are obtained simultaneously with the target,
they do not suffer from are temporal decorrelation as
with ADI (e.g. Marois et al. 2014). SDI then sup-
presses the speckle halo in a given passband by con-
structing a reference PSF drawn from (rescaled) im-
ages at other wavelengths.

Like ADI, SDI induces signal loss and is least ef-
fective at small angular separations, where band-
pass rescaling yields small displacements of a (de-
)magniﬁed planet PSF. SDI’s efﬁcacy is also limited
by non-common path errors, differential sampling of
the point-source PSFs across wavelength channels,
and the spectrum of the planet to be detected (e.g.
Gerard et al. 2019; Marois et al. 2014). Extract-
ing throughput-corrected spectra from data processed
with SDI is also more challenging than with other dif-
ferential imaging techniques (Pueyo 2016).

• Reference Star Differential Imaging (RDI) – RDI
subtracts the PSF of a companion-less reference star
from the target. It is widely used in the ultra-stable
environment of space. While ADI and SDI may yield
superior speckle suppression at moderate to wide sep-
arations, RDI may be advantageous at very small an-
gular separations where other techniques suffer from
self subtraction (Xuan et al. 2018). RDI requires a
very stable PSF to efﬁciently operate. Using it on
ground-based telescopes may require fast switching
between the target and reference star(s) for maximum
contrast gain (e.g. Wahhaj et al. 2021); in broad band-
passes, it also requires a reference star that is ex-
tremely well color matched (e.g. Krist et al. 1998).

These differential imaging techniques are used in combi-
nation with PSF subtraction algorithms. Many widely-used,
advanced PSF subtraction methods are different forms of
least-squares algorithms, which construct a reference PSF

that minimizes the variance when subtracted from a given
target image. The locally-optimized combination of images
(LOCI) algorithm constructs a reference PSF from a linear
combination of reference images weighted by coefﬁcients
c determined from the solution to the matrix equation c =
A−1b (Lafreni`ere et al. 2007a), where A is the (square)
covariance matrix for the reference library and b is the col-
umn matrix populated by elements multiplying each ref-
erence image by the target image. Another approach ex-
ploits principal component analysis (PCA), computing the
Karhunen-Lo`eve transform of the reference image set and
projects this set onto the target image to construct a combi-
nation of weighted eigenimages to subtract from the target
(Karhunen-Lo`eve Image Plane algorithm, henceforth KLIP,
Soummer et al. 2012; Amara and Quanz 2012). Multi-
ple successor algorithms such as TLOCI and A-LOCI draw
from the lineage of LOCI and/or KLIP, employing advances
such as correlation-based frame selection, pixel masking,
various rank-truncations of the covariance matrix, free pa-
rameter optimization or exploiting high-performance com-
puting to solve for the variance-minimizing coefﬁcients di-
rectly (e.g. Marois et al. 2010a, 2014; Currie et al. 2012b,
2015; Thompson and Marois 2021). Separate approaches
involve maximum-likelihood methods to model and remove
the stellar PSF (e.g. Cantalloube et al. 2015) or statistically
modeling non-stationary covariances in small regions of im-
ages to improve PSF subtraction (e.g. the PACO algorithm
Flasseur et al. 2018).

The relative performances of these algorithms vary in the
literature and may depend on their exact implementation
and suitability for a particular data set, although some work
suggests that the newer algorithms descended from LOCI
and KLIP can offer signiﬁcant improvements (e.g. Rameau
et al. 2013b; Thompson and Marois 2021). In general, all
of these algorithms enable signiﬁcant contrast gains over
simple, classical methods, especially at small angular sepa-
rations (Lafreni`ere et al. 2007a; Currie et al. 2014a).

ADI, SDI, and RDI combined with PSF subtraction
methods can attenuate and distort planet signals. The ﬁrst
methods to measure these biases and recover true planet
ﬂux measurements and astrometry injected synthetic plan-
ets into data at other locations or iteratively subtracted
negative copies of planets at their apparent positions (e.g.
Lafreni`ere et al. 2007a; Lagrange et al. 2010). Recently,
several authors have developed efﬁcient forward-modeling

methods to estimate photometric and astrometric biases at
the planet’s location (e.g. Pueyo 2016). Planet forward-
models in turn can be used as matched ﬁlters to improve
planet detection capabilities themselves (Rufﬁo et al. 2017).
Analyses of images whose speckle noise is partially sup-
pressed by advanced PSF subtraction techniques have re-
vised notions of how to quantify detection signiﬁcances
and spectroscopic uncertainties. For instance, ﬁnite sample
sizes impact our deﬁnitions for contrast limits drawn from
images with noise whitened by KLIP, LOCI, and other al-
gorithms, especially at small (1–3 λ/D) separations (Mawet
et al. 2014; Pairet et al. 2019). In IFS data, residual speckle
noise may be spatially and spectrally correlated. Consider-
ing the full spectral covariance has a substantial impact on
deriving planet atmospheric parameters from model com-
parisons (Greco and Brandt 2016).

Figure 5 shows the combined effect of high-contrast
imaging hardware and software on imaging exoplanets,
stepping through the successive improvements found from
using extreme AO, coronagraphy, and PSF subtraction.

3. Direct Imaging Detections

3.1. Taxonomy of Directly-Imaged Companions

Figure 1 shows the demographics of planetary mass
companions to stars detected via various methods. Commu-
nity consensus on the planethood of many imaged objects
(e.g. HR 8799 bcde, β Pic bc, 51 Eri b, etc.) is clear. How-
ever, identifying the exact criteria needed to distinguish be-
tween planets and brown dwarfs is challenging.

Planets have often been identiﬁed as objects with masses
below the deuterium-burning limit, nominally 13 MJ (e.g.
the IAU Working Group Deﬁnition). However, this sim-
ple criterion is poorly motivated. In addition to being time
and metallicity dependent (Spiegel et al. 2011), deuterium
burning arguably does not identify a meaningful bound-
ary for the evolution of low-mass objects (Chabrier et al.
2007; Luhman 2008), as some objects below the deuterium
burning limit have been found in conﬁgurations which im-
ply formation by cloud formation and other objects above
the deuterium burning limit have been found in conﬁgura-
tions which imply formation like a planet in a disk. For in-
stance, recent imaging surveys have found objects that are
members of quadruple systems, clearly formed by molec-
ular cloud fragmentation, with inferred masses down to 5

Currie, Biller, Lagrange et al.

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

MJ and free-ﬂoating objects with sub-deuterium burning
masses as well (Todorov et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2013). In
contrast, RV surveys have identiﬁed some systems – e.g.
the 2.7 M(cid:12) star ν Oph – with companions at ∼ 1 au with
masses of 22 and 24 MJ that are nevertheless locked in a
mean-motion resonance indicating formation in a disk (i.e.
like a planet) (Quirrenbach et al. 2019). The physics of
planet formation does not require that gas accretion shuts
off once 13 MJ of material is accreted.

An alternate deﬁnition leverages formation processes: a
planet is an object formed in a circumstellar disk around a
young star. Demographic analyses of substellar objects can
provide empirically-motivated criteria for separating plan-
ets from brown dwarfs. Studies of the substellar mass func-
tion from previous RV surveys and recent ones (i.e. the Cal-
ifornia Legacy Survey) show a local minimum at msin(i) ∼
16–30 MJ (e.g. Sahlmann et al. 2011; Kiefer et al. 2019,
T. Currie et al.
submitted). The minimum in the com-
panion mass function may be proportional to the primary
mass, indicating that companion mass ratio (q) could be a
key discriminator (Grether and Lineweaver 2006). Theory
also suggests that the semimajor axes (ap) and mass ratios
(q) of companions also help distinguish between bona ﬁde
planets and brown dwarfs (Kratter et al. 2010; Currie et al.
2011). Binary companions to more massive stars with q (cid:38)
0.025 are exceptionally rare (Kraus et al. 2008; Reggiani
et al. 2016). Distributions of protoplanetary disk radii peak
at ∼200 au and fall to low frequencies by ∼300 au (e.g.
Andrews and Williams 2007): companions at wider separa-
tions are far less likely to have formed from a disk unless
scattered to their current locations by unseen companions.
Thus, we set the following limits for a planet vs. a brown
dwarf: mass < 25 MJ, q < 0.025, and ap (cid:46) 300 au1.

Our linked spreadsheet lists the current inventory of
directly imaged exoplanets, protoplanets, higher mass-
ratio/wider separation planet-mass companions, and con-
troversial cases2. As of 1 May 2022, we identify 20 directly
imaged exoplanets that ﬁt our criteria, three of which are
imaged protoplanets. We also list another 34 dozen com-
panions that may instead be better considered as brown
dwarfs instead of planets (including companions orbiting
brown dwarfs), and 6 “controversial” cases. Some of these
individual classiﬁcations will undoubtedly change pend-
ing new analysis as may the exact values used to separate
planets from brown dwarfs. Objects in each category will
certainly be added over the next few years.

Below, we describe general properties of fully-formed
directly imaged planets within 300 au and discuss three
well-studied, emblematic cases (HR 8799, β Pic, and 51
Eri). We also summarize our current knowledge of proto-
planets and challenges with identifying imaged exoplanets.

1Our mass limit is similar to that adopted elsewhere: e.g. the NASA Exo-
planet Archive. The mass ratio and separation criteria further restrict our
sample.

3.2. Fully-formed Exoplanets

3.2.1. General Properties

Most directly imaged planets known thus far have near-
IR contrasts ranging between 10−4 (e.g. κ And b) and 10−6
(51 Eri b). All of them are self-luminous, made visible by
thermal radiation released as the planets cool and contract.
On the sky, the planets generally lie at angular separations
of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 to 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 (∼ 5–40 λ/D for an 8m telescope).

Stars hosting imaged exoplanets typically have ages of
10–100 Myr; many are found in young nearby stellar asso-
ciations (often <100 pc, with ages <100 Myr) that share
similar kinematics (proper motions, space motions) and
formed in the same star-forming region, such as Sco-Cen
or the β Pic Moving group (e.g. Zuckerman and Song 2004;
Zuckerman et al. 2011; Song et al. 2003; Schlieder et al.
2012; Schneider et al. 2012; Shkolnik et al. 2012).
(see
Section 6.1 for more details on such associations as sites
for exoplanet searches). Most stars with imaged planets to
date are B, A, or F stars, at least 50% more massive than
the Sun. Most systems with imaged planets – including sys-
tems with the ﬁrst detections (HR 8799, β Pic) – also have
Kuiper belt-like debris disks.

Planets detected to date share similar spectral types and
temperatures with more massive ﬁeld brown dwarfs, but
often show evidence of low surface gravity in their spec-
tra (Barman et al. 2011b,a). Brown dwarfs and exoplanets
alike cool monotonically with age, beginning life as hot M-
type objects, cooling to the L spectral type (with very red
near-IR colors and silicate condensate clouds (Kirkpatrick
2005), the cooler T spectral type (with blue near-IR col-
ors and strong methane absorption at 1.6 µm and 2.2 µm,
Kirkpatrick 2005) and eventually to the very cool Y spectral
type (Cushing et al. 2011; Kirkpatrick et al. 2012). Thus,
there is an age / mass / temperature degeneracy for these ob-
jects, rendering mass estimates based on models very sen-
sitive to the age assumed for the system.

Most mass estimates for imaged planets depend on lumi-
nosity evolution models, challenges for which are described
in Section 3.4. Some planets – e.g. HR 8799 bcde, β Pic b,
51 Eri b, and HD 206893 b – have dynamical mass measure-
ments or limits. Masses inferred from luminosity evolution
or derived from dynamics are typically ∼5–10 MJ. Some
planets have masses near the deuterium-burning limit (κ
And b, HD 206893 b); 51 Eri b may have a far lower mass
(as little as ∼2 MJ). Mass ratios for most imaged planets
are q ∼ 0.005–0.01: 51 Eri b may have the lowest mass ra-
tio (q ∼ 0.001). Even leading extreme AO systems are typi-
cally not sufﬁciently sensitive to detect young Jupiter-mass
planets, let alone Saturn-mass planets. However, future ca-
pabilities will close these gaps (See Section 7).

3.2.2. Emblematic Systems

While planetary mass companions to brown dwarfs
had previously been detected as early as 2004 (most no-
tably 2M1207b, Chauvin et al. 2004), the near simultane-
ous announcements of HR 8799bcd and β Pic b are widely

regarded as the ﬁrst bonaﬁde directly-imaged exoplanet
detections (Marois et al. 2008b; Lagrange et al. 2009).
Planets in both systems were detected from ground-based
facility AO systems in the near-to-mid IR in thermal emis-
sion, not scattered light3. Just over 7 years later, Macintosh
et al. (2015) announced the ﬁrst exoplanet discovered with
extreme AO: 51 Eri b.

HR 8799 – HR 8799 is a nearby (∼40 pc) mid-A ﬁeld
star with an estimated age of ∼40 Myr (Baines et al. 2012).
The star hosts a massive, resolved Kuiper belt-like debris
disk and a warm debris population interior to 10 au con-
sistent with an asteroid belt (Sadakane and Nishida 1986;
Su et al. 2009; Matthews et al. 2014; Booth et al. 2016):
possible signposts of massive, perturbing planets.

In 2008, Marois et al. announced the direct imaging dis-
covery of HR 8799 bcd followed by a fourth planet dis-
covery in 2010 (HR 8799 e; Marois et al. 2010b), located
at projected separations of 15–70 au (Figure 6, left panel).
Soon after HR 8799 bcde’s announcements, other studies
identiﬁed one or more planets in archival or separately-
obtained data (Lafreni`ere et al. 2009; Fukagawa et al. 2009;
Metchev et al. 2009; Soummer et al. 2011; Currie et al.
2011, 2012a). A decade of Keck Observatory monitoring
showed that HR 8799 bcde orbit close to the 1:2:4:8 res-
onance (Konopacky et al. 2016). Current analyses suggest
that the planet orbits are nearly coplanar with the disk, with
a small inclination of ∼27◦ (Konopacky et al. 2016). How-
ever, HR 8799 e may not orbit on a plane strictly coplanar
with HR 8799 bcd (Gravity Collaboration et al. 2019).

Originally, masses inferred from the planets’ luminosi-
ties spanned a wide range of values (5–13 MJ) (Marois
et al. 2008a, 2010a). However, dynamical stability mod-
eling strongly favors masses below 10 MJ (7 MJ) for HR
8799 cde (HR 8799 b) (Marois et al. 2010a; Currie et al.
2011; Sudol and Haghighipour 2012). Using Hipparcos
and Gaia, Brandt et al. (2021b) measured a dynamical mass
for HR 8799 e of 9.6+1.9
−1.8 MJ, consistent with these lim-
its (see Section 3.5). Additional planets may explain the

3Another object – Fomalhaut b (Kalas et al. 2008) – was announced on
the same day as the HR 8799 planets but appears to be made visible by
scattered starlight (Currie et al. 2012b; Galicher et al. 2013). Its nature is

shape of the inner edge of HR 8799’s cold belt (Booth et al.
2016), especially if they are near or below Jupiter’s mass
(Go´zdziewski and Migaszewski 2018). Any planets interior
to HR 8799 e must be below 3–4 MJ at 7–10 au and 5–6
MJ at 4–7 au (Wahhaj et al. 2021; Brandt et al. 2021b). The
HR 8799 planetary system resembles a scaled-up version of
our own outer solar system (Marois et al. 2010a).

HR 8799 bcde have been benchmark objects for under-
standing the atmospheres of young jovian planets. Their
photometry and low-resolution spectra differ from those of
older, ﬁeld substellar objects thought to have similar tem-
peratures, identifying features diagnostic of clouds, chem-
istry, and gravity (Currie et al. 2011; Barman et al. 2011a;
Galicher et al. 2011; Marley et al. 2012; Bonnefoy et al.
2014b). Higher resolution spectra probe molecular abun-
dances connected to formation mechanisms (Konopacky
et al. 2013; Barman et al. 2015). Section 4 discusses HR
8799 bcde’s spectra and atmospheres in more detail.

β Pic – The A6V star β Pictoris is the eponymous mem-
ber of a collection of kinematically-associated stars known
as the β Pic Moving Group (age∼20 Myr). The star hosts
an edge-on debris disk, imaged since the mid-eighties from
the ground and space (e.g. Smith and Terrile 1984). The
disk consists of a planetesimal ring at 70–100 au responsi-
ble for the bulk of the dust through collisions and an outer
extension comprised of small dust grains blown out by ra-
diation pressure (Lagrange et al. 2000).

Lagrange et al. (2009) ﬁrst identiﬁed β Pic b from data
obtained in 2003 with VLT/NaCo; follow-up data obtained
one year later conﬁrmed the planet (Lagrange et al. 2010).
Thanks to β Pic b’s small semi-major axis (∼ 9 au), over
75% of its orbit has been monitored (Lagrange et al. 2020;
Nowak et al. 2020). More recently, a second planet (β Pic c)
was identiﬁed from RV data and then recovered with high-
contrast inteferometric imaging with VLTI/GRAVITY (La-
grange et al. 2019; Gravity Collaboration et al. 2020).

β Pic b may partially explain the observed warp in the
edge-on debris disk and the many evaporating exocomets
identiﬁed over the past 30 years (Lagrange et al. 2000;
Kiefer et al. 2014). Planets besides β Pic bc could explain
why the inner 70 au is relatively devoid of debris dust; lo-
calized features in the disk also suggest additional planets

could be present. From RV and astrometric data, Brandt
et al. (2021a) estimate a mass of 9.3 +2.5
−2.6 MJ and 8.3 ± 1
MJ for β Pic b and c, respectively (see also Snellen and
Brown 2018; Nielsen et al. 2020, Section 3.5), although
these values heavily depend on the assumed uncertainties
on the RV data. RV and direct imaging data combined ex-
clude additional planets more massive than 2.5 MJup from
0.1 au to hundreds of au (Lagrange et al. 2020). β Pic b is
more luminous and hotter than the HR 8799 planets (Teﬀ ∼
1700–1800 K), just slightly redder than ﬁeld early L-type
dwarfs, and is likely cloudy/dusty with a low gravity (Bon-
nefoy et al. 2013; Currie et al. 2013; Chilcote et al. 2017);
β Pic c probably has a temperature intermediate between its
sibling and the HR 8799 planets (Nowak et al. 2020).

51 Eri – 51 Eridani is a 29 pc-distant early F star, a mem-
ber of the ∼20 Myr-old β Pic Moving Group, and a mem-
ber of a wide hierarchical triple system that includes an M-
dwarf binary GJ 3305 (Feigelson et al. 2006). 51 Eri has a
detected infrared excess, modeled with a cold dust belt lo-
cated approximately between 5 and 80 au (Patel et al. 2014;
Riviere-Marichalar et al. 2014).

The GPI campaign (GPIES) team discovered 51 Eri b,
a faint planet at rproj ∼ 13 au (Figure 6, right panel; Mac-
intosh et al. 2015). The planet is the ﬁrst discovered using
extreme AO and the ﬁrst incontrovertible T dwarf planet,
showing strong methane absorption in H band. The planet
is likely more eccentric than either β Pic b or HR 8799 bcde
(Maire et al. 2019; De Rosa et al. 2020, e ∼ 0.4–0.62). If
conﬁrmed, an eccentric orbit could indicate the presence of
an additional massive body or could be due to gravitational
perturbations from GJ 3305AB. Assuming a hot-start lumi-
nosity evolution, current data rule out other planets more
massive than 4 MJ beyond 5 au and more massive than 2
MJ beyond 9 au (Samland et al. 2017).

The mass of 51 Eri b is not well constrained: values de-
rived from comparing 51 Eri b’s luminosity and age to evo-
lutionary models favor ∼2 MJ, while atmospheric model-
ing may favor larger values, up to ∼ 9 MJ (Macintosh et al.
2015; Samland et al. 2017). Different characterization stud-
ies also ﬁnd slightly diverging atmosphere properties, il-
lustrating the challenge associated with characterizing very
faint exoplanets with direct imaging (Samland et al. 2017;
Rajan et al. 2017). Analysis of Gaia and Hipparcos astrom-
etry set an upper limit of 11 MJ for 51 Eri b (Dupuy et al.
2022). The planet likely has a temperature of ∼700 K and
either lacks clouds or is only partially covered by clouds
(Rajan et al. 2017; Samland et al. 2017).

3.3. Protoplanets

Direct images of planets in active assembly (protoplan-
ets) around stars that still retain gas and dust-rich proto-
planetary disks clarify how and where planets form. The
large distances to the nearest star-forming regions (∼150
pc) mean that protoplanets orbiting their host stars at solar
system scales are located at very small angular separations.
However, protoplanets can be bright (L ∼ 10−2–10−3 L(cid:12)),
especially if they are surrounded by their own circumplan-
etary disks (e.g. Zhu 2015).

The 5 Myr-old 0.87 M(cid:12) star PDS 70 hosts the ﬁrst in-
controvertible detections of jovian protoplanets: PDS 70 b
and PDS 70 c (Keppler et al. 2018, 2019; M¨uller et al. 2018;
Haffert et al. 2019) (Figure 7, left). Both protoplanets are
located within the PDS 70 disk cavity, at angular separa-
tions of ρ ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)18 and 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)24 and estimated semimajor axes
∼20 and 34 au (Wang et al. 2021). Dynamical arguments
strongly favor masses less than 10 MJ for PDS 70 b, while
PDS 70 c’s mass is more poorly constrained. Masses in-
ferred from SED modeling range between 1 and a few jo-

10

Currie, Biller, Lagrange et al.

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

vian masses (Stolker et al. 2020). PDS 70 b is slightly ec-
centric (e ∼ 0.17 ± 0.06), while PDS 70 c’s orbit is consis-
tent with being circular. The protoplanets’ IR data are best
ﬁt by model atmospheres with substantial dust/extinction.

PDS 70 bc show Hα emission consistent with accretion
at rates of 1–2×10−8 M(cid:12) yr−1, slightly less than the stellar
accretion rate (Haffert et al. 2019), but lack evidence for
Br-γ accretion (Wang et al. 2021). PDS 70 c shows direct
evidence for a circumplanetary disk with an estimated mass
of 0.007–0.03 M⊕. Thermal IR data may suggest that PDS
70 b is surrounded by a circumplanetary disk (Stolker et al.
2020; Wang et al. 2021).

Recently, data from Subaru/SCExAO and the Hubble
Space Telescope over 13 years reveal evidence for a wide-
separation (∼93 au) embedded protoplanet around the 1–
3 Myr-old, 2.4 M(cid:12) star AB Aurigae (Currie et al. 2022).
AB Aur b is consistent with a protoplanet responsible for
the millimeter dust cavity and CO gas spirals both seen by
ALMA (Tang et al. 2017). It appears spatially extended,
plausibly due to light from the central source reprocessed by
the star’s protoplanetary disk. The best-ﬁt composite model
explaining AB Aur b’s optical to near-IR emission includes
a 2.75 RJ, 9 MJ source with a surface gravity of log(g) =
3.5, emitting at a much hotter temperature than PDS 70 bc
˙M ∼ 1.1×10−6
(∼2000–2500 K), and accreting at a rate of
MJ yr−1. The source is detected in Hα although it is un-
clear whether this emission is due to accretion. Embedded
in a massive disk with numerous spiral arms at over three
times Neptune’s disk instead of in a fully cleared cavity like
PDS 70 bc, the properties of AB Aur b may point to a planet
formation mechanism by disk instability (see Section 6).

Prior to the discovery of PDS 70 bc, other studies
claimed detections of protoplanets located within the gaps
of or embedded in disks around young stars. The 2-solar
mass, protoplanetary disk-hosting star HD 100546 has a
protoplanet candidate at ∼ 50 au and another at ∼ 13
au, just interior to the gap in the protoplanetary disk (HD
100546 bc; Quanz et al. 2013; Currie et al. 2015). HD
100546 b has been detected in multiple data sets but ev-
idence for orbital motion is not yet clear (Rameau et al.
2017; Sissa et al. 2018); HD 100546 c has been imaged
in a single data set and inferred through spectroastrometry
but not yet imaged in subsequent data (Currie et al. 2015;
Brittain et al. 2014; Sissa et al. 2018).
Interpreting both
candidates – whether a planet or disk feature – is challeng-
ing (Currie et al. 2015, 2017; Rameau et al. 2017; Sissa
et al. 2018). Both candidates require further study and con-
ﬁrmation.

Two studies presented detections of protoplanets around
the young, Sun-like star LkCa 15 through a combination of
sparse aperture masking interferometry (SAM) and Hα dif-
ferential imaging (LkCa 15 bcd; Kraus and Ireland 2012;
Sallum et al. 2015). However, later direct imaging obser-
vations showed that the SAM detections correspond to disk
features (Currie et al. 2019): LkCa 15 b technically remains
a candidate for now due to its single epoch Hα detection
(though see Mendigut´ıa et al. 2018). Other claimed proto-

planet detections have been revealed to likely be misidenti-
ﬁed disk signals instead of planets (e.g. Rich et al. 2019).

3.4. Challenges with Interpreting Detections

3.4.1. Conﬁrming Companionship

Direct imaging observations reveal many point sources
that are unrelated background stars instead of bound com-
panions, especially for systems in the Galactic plane (e.g.
Galicher et al. 2016). Conﬁrming candidate planets as
bound – i.e. sharing common proper motion with and orbit-
ing their stars – often requires multi-year observations, de-
pending on the star’s proper motion. In some pathological
cases, background stars can have a non-zero proper motion
and thus are more easily confused with bona ﬁde planets
(e.g. Nielsen et al. 2017). In the absence of full conﬁrma-
tion, an object’s near-IR spectrum can provide strong evi-
dence that it is a directly-imaged exoplanet (e.g. for 51 Eri
b; Macintosh et al. 2015).

3.4.2. Estimating Accurate Masses

Masses for imaged planets and planet candidates are typ-
ically not directly measured but are instead estimated using
luminosity evolution models that map between an object’s
brightness and mass as a function of age. Accurate mass es-
timates therefore are affected by uncertainties in these mod-
els and require precise system ages. Hot start models for
planet luminosity evolution assume a high initial entropy,
resulting in bright planets for the ﬁrst 1–100 M yr (Baraffe
et al. 2002; Burrows et al. 2001, 2003). Cold start mod-
els assume a low initial entropy, resulting in planets that
are substantially fainter for the ﬁrst 100 Myr (Marley et al.
2007). Originally, hot start models were used to describe
planets formed by disk instability, while cold start models
described planets formed by core accretion (Marley et al.
2007)4. However, recent models show that core accretion-
formed planets can be compatible with hot start-like lumi-
nosity evolutions, and jovian planets may form with a range
of initial entropies (Berardo et al. 2017; Spiegel and Bur-
rows 2012). Aside from 51 Eri b, all planets imaged thus
far are only consistent with a hot-start luminosity evolution.
Precise ages can be exceptionally challenging to derive
for isolated stars (e.g. Soderblom et al. 2014). Members of
young moving groups or other nearby associations can be
age-dated using a variety of methods: e.g. ﬁtting group
Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram positions with stellar
evolutionary models, Lithium abundances. Thus, moving
group or association membership can yield a star’s age.
However, even stars with a motion similar to bona ﬁde mov-
ing group members could instead be interlopers, especially
if they have dissimilar space positions. For isolated Sun-
like stars, stellar rotation and activity can give age esti-
mates, albeit with signiﬁcant scatter (Barnes 2007; Delorme
et al. 2011; Angus et al. 2019). For early-type stars, HR di-

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

agram positions have provided approximate ages: optical
interferometry can now provide more precise estimates by
resolving the stars themselves (e.g. Jones et al. 2016).

Revisions in the stellar age often affects the interpreta-
tion of an imaged companion. For example, based on the
primary’s claimed membership in the Columba association,
κ And b was originally thought to be 12–13 MJ (Carson
et al. 2013). In contrast, the primary’s HR diagram position
resembles an older system (220 Myr), which would imply
the companion is ∼ 50 MJ (Hinkley et al. 2013). However,
through optical interferometry, Jones et al. (2016) showed
that the star is likely (nearly) coeval with Columba even
if it is not a member (∼47 Myr), implying the object is a
planet-mass companion. Later, near-IR spectra of κ And
b were found to be consistent with a planet interpretation
(Currie et al. 2018). In contrast, GJ 504 B was originally
announced as a 3–8.5 MJ planet with an age of 100–510
Myr (Kuzuhara et al. 2013). However, subsequent analysis
of the star suggested a revised age of ∼2.5 Gyr and thus a
mass into the brown dwarf regime (D’Orazi et al. 2017).

3.4.3. Planet or disk feature?

Distinguishing between highly-structured disk signals
and bona ﬁde protoplanets is a steep, chronic challenge.
Advanced algorithms needed to detect protoplanets can at-
tenuate both disk and planet signals: forward-modeling is
required to ensure that a claimed planet detection is not a
partially subtracted piece of the disk (Currie et al. 2017).
For systems with hot dust (T ∼ 1000–2000 K) near the star
that intercepts and reprocesses emission, the disk’s scat-
tered light spectrum may strongly resemble spectra of bona
ﬁde protoplanets (Mulders et al. 2013). Orbital motion over
multi-year timescales can better establish that a signal is
an orbiting planet and not a static disk feature (Keppler
et al. 2018). Hα emission can also pinpoint actively accret-
ing protoplanets (Haffert et al. 2019); however, accretion
onto protoplanets embedded in disks may be unidentiﬁable,
since optical extinction likely renders Hα undetectable.

Fomalhaut b may represent the ﬁrst of yet another class
of objects with a challenging interpretation (Kalas et al.
2008). The object was initially identiﬁed as a directly im-
aged planet, made visible by both reﬂected light from a cir-
cumplanetary disk and thermal emission, and responsible
for sculpting the star’s Kuiper belt-like debris disk. How-
ever, later analysis showed that Fomalhaut b’s spectrum
is completely explained by scattered starlight and its or-
bit likely crosses the ring (Janson et al. 2012; Currie et al.
2012b; Galicher et al. 2013; Kalas et al. 2013):
the ob-
ject is lower in mass and likely made visible purely by cir-
cumplanetary dust. Recently, from analyzing archival and
unpublished data, Gaspar and Rieke (2020) proposed that
Fomalhaut b may be fading and dispersing, consistent with
a massive planetesimal collision. Other analyses ﬁnd no
clear evidence for these two trends (Currie et al. 2012b), al-
though they were conducted only over a subset of available
data. Future observations of Fomalhaut b and/or reanalyses

of recent data may clarify its true nature.

3.5. Synergies with Other Techniques

The limitations of direct imaging affect our ability to in-
terpret data for individual objects and to draw conclusions
from large-scale population studies. For individual objects,
mass estimates depend on both the age of the planet and the
chosen luminosity evolutionary model (see Section 3.4). At
a population level, the angular resolution of the telescope
and the achievable contrast of the instrument limit the range
of detectable planetary masses and semi-major axes with di-
rect imaging. Combining direct imaging with other planet
detection techniques partially mitigates these limits.

Relative astrometric measurements of a planet around
its host star cannot alone be used to precisely measure the
mass of the orbiting planet; the semi-major axis of the rel-
ative orbit encodes the system’s total mass, not the individ-
ual components’ masses. The system’s mass ratio, and thus
the mass of the planet, can be measured if the semi-major
axis of the orbit of the star around the system barycenter
is known. This orbit can be measured either using ab-
solute astrometric measurements from catalogues such as
Hipparcos and Gaia, or spectroscopic observations to mea-
sure the Doppler shift of the star’s spectral lines over the
course of the orbit.
In some cases, high-resolution spec-
troscopy can measure the Doppler shift of the planet’s spec-
tral lines (Snellen et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2021), also yield-
ing the mass ratio. Combining the star’s orbit around the
barycenter with the relative astrometry between star and
planet yields the mass ratio, and a dynamical mass for the
planet. In multi-planet systems with high-precision astrom-
etry, the the planets’ mutual gravitation can be detected by
ﬁtting for deviations from Keplerian motion, yielding their
mass estimates (Lacour et al. 2021).

The β Pic system is the current benchmark example of
combining planet detection techniques to measure model-
independent masses. Relative astrometry of β Pic b and
c combined with the star’s astrometric and RV measure-
ments provides dynamical masses for the planets (Snellen
and Brown 2018; Lagrange et al. 2019; Dupuy et al. 2019).
Measurements of non-Keplerian motion due to the mutual
gravity of β Pic b and c are also now possible given the
precision of recent interferometric monitoring campaigns
(Nowak et al. 2020).

Combining astrometry and/or RV and direct imaging
data can yield dynamical masses for other directly-imaged
planets, as well as for numerous brown dwarf companions
(Grandjean et al. 2019; Brandt et al. 2020, 2021b). The up-
coming Gaia data releases for the full and extended mission
will be used extensively in future detection and character-
ization studies of directly-imaged planets, yielding further
dynamical masses for directly imaged companions. The ex-
tended mission will provide precision astrometric measure-
ments of the host star over ≈10 years.

Combining direct imaging with other detection tech-
niques can improve planet occurrence rate measurements

12

Currie, Biller, Lagrange et al.

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

and can better determine the planet frequency distribu-
tionover a range of masses, orbital periods, and host star
properties. Long-term Doppler surveys are largely com-
plete to giant planets within ∼5 au, and partially complete
to giant planets out to ∼10 au, the current inner limit of sen-
sitivity of direct imaging surveys. Thus, combining results
from both techniques reveals giant planet demographics out
to ∼100 au (Section 6.3). RV studies of young stars (e.g.
Lagrange et al. 2019; Grandjean et al. 2021) allow occur-
rence rates to be compared for stars of similar ages, trac-
ing the extent of giant planet migration over system life-
times and its effect on planet frequency. The ﬁnal Gaia
planet catalog (Perryman et al. 2014) will also help place
demographic measurements of young, wide-separation gi-
ant planets into context, as astrometry will be better able to
probe intermediate separation giant planets (∼1-10 AU, (cid:38)1
MJup) around younger, higher-mass stars compared to RV.
These target stars more closely match the hosts of imaged
planets. Combining Gaia observations of younger, higher-
mass stars with direct imaging will illuminate trends in oc-
currence rate as a function of stellar mass and age.

Direct imaging also shares an important overlap with
planet detection by microlensing. Both techniques are sen-
sitive to planets beyond the snow line, with microlensing
probing lower planet-star mass ratios (e.g. Suzuki et al.
2016), while the host mass of imaged planets can be di-
rectly determined, and the planet mass inferred from mod-
In addition, singly lensed short-period microlensing

events can represent either a free-ﬂoating planet or a wide-
separation bound planet (Sumi et al. 2011). Constraints on
the wide-separation giant planet population can be deter-
mined from imaging, thus more deﬁnitively constraining
the free-ﬂoating planet occurrence rate.

4. Atmospheric Characterization of Directly Imaged

Exoplanets

Direct imaging enables characterization of young (age
<200 Myr) jovian exoplanets at wider separations with neg-
ligible irradiation compared to most transiting planets. In
this section, we ﬁrst summarize from an empirical stand-
point what we have learned about the atmospheres of the
current cohort of young directly imaged giant planets from
their photometry and spectroscopy. We then consider the
theoretical side of the picture, in particular, the state-of-the-
art in how we model these complex, cool atmospheres.

4.1. Empirical Constraints from Time-Averaged Ob-

servations

4.1.1. Photometry

Photometry in the major near-to-mid IR passbands – J,
H, K, Lp, Ms – covers the bulk of emission for young su-
perjovian planets and provided the ﬁrst empirical diagnos-
tic of young, directly-imaged planet atmospheric properties.
Figure 8 displays a typical near-IR color-magnitude dia-
gram for selected directly-imaged planets and other planet-
mass companions compared to older, more massive ﬁeld

Fig. 8.— Near-infrared color-magnitude diagram of ﬁeld M,
L and T-dwarfs (gray circles), isolated objects exhibiting evi-
dence of youth or possessing low surface gravity (blue squares),
and directly imaged substellar/planetary-mass companions to stars
and brown dwarfs (red diamonds). We annotate selected imaged
exoplanets/planet-mass companions. Young, low-gravity objects

gravity ﬁeld objects. Data obtained from the UltracoolSheet.

brown dwarfs and younger brown dwarfs whose ages and
masses partially overlap with those of most imaged planets.
Imaged planets and planet-mass companions span the full
luminosity range characteristic of mature late-M, L, and T
ﬁeld brown dwarfs (vertical axis). However, young brown
dwarfs, planets, and planet-mass companions typically have
redder colors than ﬁeld objects.

The most pronounced differences between planet and
ﬁeld brown dwarf photometry occur near the transition from
methane-poor L-type dwarfs to methane-absorbing T-type
dwarfs. The ﬁrst imaged planet-mass companion – 2M
1207 B – and some of the ﬁrst imaged exoplanets (e.g. HR
8799 b) are particularly discrepant, appearing to populate a
previously empty part of these diagrams consistent with a
reddened extension of the L dwarf sequence to lower lumi-
nosities (Chauvin et al. 2004; Marois et al. 2008a; Currie
et al. 2011; Barman et al. 2011a). Over the full 1–5 µm
spectral range, photometry for these objects appears red-
der and more blackbody-like (Figure 10, top-left). More
recent studies show that a number of other young imaged
planets/planet-mass companions – e.g. HD 95086 b, TYC
8998-760-1 c, HD 206893 b, 2M 2236+4751 B – also popu-
late this region (e.g. Rameau et al. 2013b; Bohn et al. 2021;
Delorme et al. 2017a; Bowler et al. 2017).

Differences between ﬁeld and young objects with T
spectral types are less clear. Few young, T-type planet-mass

13

Currie, Biller, Lagrange et al.

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

companions have been identiﬁed in the last decade: e.g. 51
Eri b (Macintosh et al. 2015), GU Psc B (Naud et al. 2014).
While GU Psc B follows the sequence of ﬁeld brown dwarfs
in near-IR color-magnitude diagrams, the exoplanet 51 Eri b
is redder than ﬁeld brown dwarfs. Four additional compan-
ions orbiting primary stars with intermediate ages (≤1 Gyr;
HN Peg B, ROSS458C, BD204-39B, Coconuts-2b, Luh-
man et al. 2007; Goldman et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2021c)
show similar but less pronounced deviations with respect to
ﬁeld dwarfs in the same luminosity range. Some directly-
imaged L/T transition planets and planet-mass companions
have color-magnitude diagram positions discrepant from
ﬁeld objects in thermal IR passbands probing methane ab-
sorption (3.3µm, Ms) but have positions similar to ﬁeld ob-
jects in other passbands (e.g. Lp, 4.05 µm) (Skemer et al.
2012, 2014a; Currie et al. 2014a).

4.1.2. Spectroscopy

Fig. 9.— Near-infrared spectra of imaged exoplanets obtained
using low-resolution integral-ﬁeld spectroscopy:
from top-to-
bottom, β Pic b (Chilcote et al. 2017), κ And b from Sub-
aru/CHARIS taken in a lower-resolution single-shot mode (Cur-
rie et al. 2018), HD 206893 b (Ward-Duong et al. 2021), PDS 70b
from VLT/SPHERE (Mesa et al. 2019), and 51 Eri b (Rajan et al.
2017) from Gemini/GPI. The spectra are normalized by the ﬂux
between 2.05–2.15µm (1.6µm for 51 Eri b for clarity). Dashed
lines indicate the offset applied to each spectrum.

Over the past decade, IFS instruments, especially those
used in combination with extreme AO systems (P1640,
SPHERE, GPI, SCExAO-CHARIS) have provided critical
low-resolution (R∼20 to 80) near-IR (1-2.5µm) spectra of
most directly-imaged exoplanets, a representative sample of
which is displayed in Figure 9. Near-IR spectra provide key

diagnostics of brown dwarf and planet atmospheres. Spec-
tral indices derived from low-resolution data like H20 yield
coarse estimates of spectral types (Allers and Liu 2013).
The H-band continuum index and (possibly) the H2-K in-
dex is a diagnostic of surface gravity (Allers and Liu 2013;
Canty et al. 2013).

Following trends from photometry, the spectra of young
directly-imaged planets and other planet-mass companions
show signiﬁcant differences with the spectra of ﬁeld brown
dwarfs. Among the most notable are the following:

• Chemistry – The L/T transition traces the onset of
methane absorption. However, spectra of some L/T
transition exoplanets and planet-mass companions –
the HR 8799 planets, 2M 1207 B – show a
e.g.
lack of methane absorption compared to ﬁeld dwarfs
with similar temperatures and CMD positions (Bar-
man et al. 2011a,b; Bonnefoy et al. 2016; Greenbaum
et al. 2018). Thermal IR spectra conﬁrm that the HR
8799 planets also have weaker absorption in the 3.3
µm methane ﬁlter (Doelman et al. 2022).

• Gravity – The H-band spectra for L dwarf and L/T
transition directly imaged exoplanets / planetary-
mass objects such as HR 8799 b, κ And b, ROXs
42Bb show highly peaked H-band spectra and/or
red K-band spectra compared to ﬁeld dwarfs (Lucas
et al. 2001; Barman et al. 2011a; Currie et al. 2018,
2014b; Bowler et al. 2014; Allers and Liu 2013; Liu
et al. 2013; Gauza et al. 2015). The H and K-band
shapes probe collisionally-induced absorption (CIA)
of hydrogen; lower gravities result in weaker CIA
and thus peaked H-band peaks and redder K-band
slopes.

• Dust – At least some of the HR 8799 planets have
spectral properties and molecular absorptions that are
well matched by those of young free-ﬂoating objects
at the L-T transition (see also Section 4.3). How-
ever, no object yet reproduces the available 1-2.5µm
spectra of HR8799b, which may be due to the lack
of identiﬁed young free-ﬂoating T-type objects. A
handful of early-T-type objects such as the AB Do-
radus member 2MASS J13243553+6358281 (Gagn´e
et al. 2018a) (see Section 4.1.1) can reproduce the
spectral bands of HR 8799 b provided that an extra
layer of extinction by sub-micron dust particles is ap-
plied to these empirical template spectra to match the
spectral slope of the planet (Bonnefoy et al. 2016).
HD 206893 b presents an even more extreme exam-
ple, with an even ﬂatter, more blackbody-like spec-
trum yielding an extremely red spectrum from 1 to
2.5 µm, likely due to substantial atmospheric dust
(Milli et al. 2017; Delorme et al. 2017b; Ward-Duong
et al. 2021).

Spectra of the coolest and lowest mass imaged exoplanet
known to date (51 Eri b) display a clear and so-far unique

14

Currie, Biller, Lagrange et al.

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

detection of a methane absorption at 1.6µm in the spectrum
of an imaged exoplanet (Macintosh et al. 2015; Rajan et al.
2017), coincident with an enhancement in the K-band ﬂux.
Similar K-band ﬂux enhancements have already been noted
in young mid- to late-T dwarfs but the enhancement is par-
ticularly extreme in the case of 51 Eri b and is due to the
reduced collision induced absorption of H2 (Borysow et al.
1997) in 51 Eri b’s lower-pressure atmosphere.

Protoplanets display far more featureless, blackbody-
like spectra. PDS 70 bc’s spectra reveal an extremely red
spectral continuum devoid of the strong water-band feature
(1.3-1.4µm) expected given the observed luminosity of the
planets (M¨uller et al. 2018; Mesa et al. 2019). Higher-
resolution K-band spectra show a lack of molecular absorp-
tion in PDS 70 b’s spectrum (Cugno et al. 2021). The cir-
cumplanetary disks and/or cocoon surrounding each planets
(see Fig 7 and Christiaens et al. 2019; Benisty et al. 2021)
produce signiﬁcant foreground extinction (e.g., Hashimoto
et al. 2020) and may produce spectroscopic properties simi-
lar to what is seen in the near-infrared spectra of enshrouded
class I protostars (e.g. Connelley and Greene 2010). The
near-IR spectrum of AB Aur b is reproduced by a 2000-
2500 K blackbody but likewise lacks clear evidence for
molecular absorption common in fully-formed substellar
objects with similar temperatures (Currie et al. 2022).

Aside from a few isolated cases (e.g. HR 8799 bcde),
the spectroscopic properties of imaged exoplanets are more
poorly constrained at wavelengths longward of 2.5µm. The
3-5 µm range is particularly interesting since it contains
both methane and 12CO absorption features diagnostic
of carbon chemistry (CO-CH4) and cloud structures (e.g.
Miles et al. 2018, 2020). The Lp-band spectra of hot-
ter young M7 to L3 companions presented in Stone et al.
(2016) show no signiﬁcant difference with those of ﬁeld
dwarf counterparts. The Lp spectrum of κ And b is well
matched with that of young, nearby free-ﬂoating brown
dwarfs (Stone et al. 2020). A few free-ﬂoating planet ana-
logues have high-quality 3-14.5 µm IRTF, AKARI, and
Spitzer spectra (Cushing et al. 2008; Sorahana and Yama-
mura 2012). Analysis of these data would beneﬁt from an
improved knowledge of the age and nature of these objects.
While most spectra for directly imaged planets to date
has been at resolution R <100, higher-resolution spectra
are yielding promising results. Near-IR IFS instruments
at medium resolving powers (R=2000–6000) fed by stan-
dard adaptive-optics modules are available on multiple 8-m
class telescopes (e.g. Gemini/NIFS, VLT/MUSE and SIN-
FONI, Keck/OSIRIS). Medium-resolution IFS data enables
innovative strategies for evaluating and subtracting the stel-
lar halo with the spatial diversity (e.g., Thatte et al. 2007;
Seifahrt et al. 2007; Wilcomb et al. 2020). Most current
medium resolution spectroscopic results are for young late-
M and early-L young companions straddling the deuterium-
burning boundary at ρ >0.5” (e.g., McElwain et al. 2007;
Schmidt et al. 2008; Patience et al. 2010; Bowler et al.
2011; Bonnefoy et al. 2014a; Daemgen et al. 2017; Wilcomb
et al. 2020). However, ADI observations on these instru-

ments (Lavigne et al. 2009; Barman et al. 2011a; Meshkat
et al. 2015) and improved data reduction strategies have
recently allowed the extraction of high quality medium-
resolution spectra of emblematic exoplanets HR8799 bc
and HIP65426 b (Konopacky et al. 2013; Barman et al.
2015; Petrus et al. 2021) deeply buried in the speckle noise.
The planets’ spectra show fainter and narrower molecular
bands (FeH, CO) and atomic lines (Na I, K I), sensitive
to the surface gravity and primordial composition of the
objects (C/O ratio, metallicity). They also reveal emis-
sion lines (Hα/0.656µm, P aβ/1.282µm, Brγ/2.166µm)
that trace active accretion (e.g., Haffert et al. 2019; Bon-
nefoy et al. 2014a; Zhang et al. 2021a) and that can be
used both for characterizing the accretion processes (e.g.,
Aoyama and Ikoma 2019; Thanathibodee et al. 2019) and
detecting new planets (Uyama et al. 2017; Haffert et al.
2019).

Novel data processing techniques such as “molecular
mapping”, in combination with medium-resolution spectra,
can also partly deblend the many ro-vibrational lines con-
tained in planet spectra, which form the broad absorption
bands observed at lower resolution (GPI, SPHERE). These
molecular patterns can be extricated by cross-correlating a
template spectrum to the planet spectrum in order to reveal
faint molecular signatures (Konopacky et al. 2013; Zhang
et al. 2021a). “Molecular mapping”, applied to each in-
dividual spaxel of an IFS datacube can simultaneously (i)
detect exoplanets whose continuum emission would have
been blurred by the speckle noise and residual stray light
introduced by the instrument optics, (ii) characterize unam-
biguously their molecular content, and (iii) measure their
Keplerian velocity (Hoeijmakers et al. 2018; Petit dit de
la Roche et al. 2018; Petrus et al. 2020; Cugno et al.
2021). This method, as well as other supervised and non-
supervised data processing techniques (Rufﬁo et al. 2019;
Rameau et al. 2021) applied on such IFS data will criti-
cally boost the detection and characterization capabilities
on the next generation of IFS operating on the 8-m class
telescopes (GTC-FRIDA, VLT/ERIS, VLT/SPHERE+ and
GPI 2.0) and the ELTs (e.g., Houll´e et al. 2021).

High-resolution echelle spectroscopy (R≥20,000) will
go further to resolve individual molecular lines and atomic
line proﬁles and provide a measurement of the objects’ ro-
tational broadening (v sin(i)). High SNR spectra have
been collected on a few young late-M and early-L com-
panions (McLean et al. 2007; Rice et al. 2010) and free-
ﬂoating analogues, but these observations usually require
a large amount of telescope time. Cross-correlating lower
SNR companion spectra or spectral residuals with templates
can access the companion’s Keplerian and rotational veloc-
itiess, check for speciﬁc molecular signatures, and disen-
tangle companions from the dominant speckle noise pro-
duced by the host star. This technique is being used on a
steadily increasing number of companions (Snellen et al.
2014; Schwarz et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018; Bryan et al.
2020a; Xuan et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021) and is a promis-
ing method for identifying closer-in and fainter exoplanets

Inferred Theoretical Properties from Time-Averaged
Observations

The empirical comparisons described in the previous two
sections, combined with atmospheric models spanning a
wide parameter space in temperature, gravity, clouds, and
chemistry, provide novel constraints on the atmospheric
properties of directly-imaged exoplanets.

Figure 10 summarizes our current understanding of the
key atmospheric properties of young, directly imaged gi-
ant planets. Young exoplanets likely are dustier and have
thicker clouds than ﬁeld brown dwarfs of the same effec-
tive temperatures (top-left panel) (Currie et al. 2011; Bar-
man et al. 2011a; Bonnefoy et al. 2016). For a ﬁxed ob-
served effective temperature, thicker clouds translate into
hotter temperature proﬁles, meaning that the temperature
is higher at a given atmospheric pressure. The τ = 1 sur-
face is more uniform with wavelength, resulting in a ﬂatter,
more blackbody-like spectrum (magenta line) compared to
models with thinner clouds (black line). This effect is most
pronounced at the L/T transition – e.g. for planets like HR
8799 bcde. The redder colors of many L-type exoplanets
are likely explained by clouds (e.g. Currie et al. 2013);
the redder color of 51 Eri b may also be due to at least
partial cloudiness (Rajan et al. 2017). Planets and planet-
mass companions at the L/T transition also show evidence
for non-equilibrium carbon chemistry, producing a lack of
methane absorption in K band, ﬂat spectra at 3–4 µm and
weak emission at 5 µm (Galicher et al. 2011; Konopacky
et al. 2013; Skemer et al. 2014a).

Both clouds and chemistry are strongly inﬂuenced by

surface gravity (Marley et al. 2012). Lower gravities yield
pressure-temperature proﬁles more characteristic of hotter
dwarfs and move the depth at which carbon-based chemical
reactions are quenched deep in the atmosphere, leading to
an elevated abundance of CO (Barman et al. 2011a; Mar-
ley et al. 2012). In the coming years, more directly-imaged
planet detections spanning a wider range of mass, age, and
temperature will better clarify how the clouds, chemistry,
and gravity of young jovian planets evolve (see Section 7).

4.3. Time-Resolved Atmospheric Properties: Rotation

Measurements and Variability

The photometric and spectroscopic observations de-
scribed in the previous two sections are time-averages –
observations either capturing short, 1-2 hour snapshots or
averaging over multiple observations covering different
rotational phases. However, directly imaged exoplanets,
like their higher-mass brown dwarf cousins, are dynamic,
rapidly rotating objects. Measuring spectral line broaden-
ing (v sin(i)) for ﬁeld brown dwarfs and monitoring their
photometric variability reveals rotation periods of ∼3-20
hours (Zapatero Osorio et al. 2006). Recently, Tannock
et al. (2021) have even found 3 brown dwarfs with rotation
periods as short as ∼1 hour! Rotation measurements are
scarcer for directly imaged exoplanets and their analogues,
but current measurements suggest that directly imaged ex-
oplanets are also fast rotators. Spectral-line broadening
measurements of β Pic b indicate a rotation period of 7-
9 hours, Snellen et al. (2014). Rotational periods derived
for 27 planetary mass objects (both as companions and free-
ﬂoating) from the compilation of Bryan et al. (2020a) range
from 4 to 22 hours.

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

If an object is a rapid rotator and also has asymmet-
ric top-of-atmosphere structure (e.g. patchy thin and thick
it will display signiﬁcant variability, appearing
clouds),
considerably brighter at some rotational phases than others.
Large variability surveys of brown dwarfs ﬁnd variability is
common (Radigan et al. 2014; Wilson et al. 2014; Radigan
2014; Metchev et al. 2015). Variability amplitudes extend
up to ∼20% in the near-IR. Young directly imaged giant
planets are likely to be even more variable. From a survey
of 30 young, low-surface gravity brown dwarfs with esti-
mated masses <25 MJ (e.g., free-ﬂoating analogues to di-
rectly imaged exoplanets), Vos et al. (2019) ﬁnd that 30% of
low surface-gravity L0-L7.5 dwarfs are variable, compared
to 3% of ﬁeld L dwarfs. Exoplanet analogues with late-L
spectral types appear to be particularly variable, with peak-
to-trough amplitudes >5% in a number of notable cases
(Biller et al. 2015; Lew et al. 2016; Vos et al. 2018; Biller
et al. 2018; Bowler et al. 2020b; Zhou et al. 2020). These
objects have spectra that are nearly identical to those of
the archetypical HR 8799 planets (Bonnefoy et al. 2016):
thus, their variability properties are likely similar to those
of these bonaﬁde exoplanet companions. Young, planetary
mass T dwarfs are likely more variable than their old, ﬁeld
counterparts as well. Two out of the three highest ampli-
tude T dwarf variables known, speciﬁcally SIMP 0136 and
2M2139, have recently been conﬁrmed as planetary-mass
members of the Carina Near association (Gagn´e et al. 2017;
Zhang et al. 2021b).

Variability studies, especially spectroscopic variability
studies, are valuable probes of the top-of-atmosphere struc-
ture (TOA) of brown dwarfs and directly imaged exoplan-
ets. A unique map cannot be obtained from lightcurve
monitoring. However,
indicative maps can be gener-
ated from the spectral mapping technique, which uses
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo techniques to ﬁt elliptical
spots (Kostov and Apai 2013; Karalidi et al. 2015, 2016)
and/or planetary-scale waves (a sinusoidal bright-dark pat-
tern conﬁned to a single latitudinal band, Apai et al. 2017)
to multi-wavelength lightcurves. Quickly changing features
on several ﬁeld brown dwarfs may indicate that the beating
between multiple planetary-scale waves better describes the
lightcurves observed for ﬁeld brown dwarfs than elliptical,
starspot-like spots (Apai et al. 2017, 2021).

Different wavelengths also probe different depths in
brown dwarf and giant exoplanet atmospheres. Mid-IR
data probe higher-up, cooler cloudtops; the near-IR probes
deeper into cloud decks (e.g. Manjavacas et al. 2021). No-
tably, TOA structure appears to vary in between this level,
seen as phase shifts between the near-IR and mid-IR in the
substellar object lightcurves, where successive maxima /
minima in near-IR are offset in time relative to their mid-
IR counterparts. Such phase shifts have been observed in
several brown dwarfs (Yang et al. 2016) and in at least one
free-ﬂoating planetary mass object (Biller et al. 2018).

The studies described in the preceding paragraph have
mostly targeted higher mass ﬁeld brown dwarfs. Next gen-
eration telescopes and instruments such as JWST will en-

able similar studies for free-ﬂoating planetary mass objects
and bright exoplanet companions such as β Pic b and HR
8799 bcde. Giant exoplanet companions are likely to be
equally variable compared to highly variable free-ﬂoating
planetary mass objects, but are much more difﬁcult tar-
gets for variability studies, given the technical challenges of
obtaining high-ﬁdelity, highly-stable spectrophotometry for
close companions. Two studies have attempted variability
monitoring for the HR 8799 planets using VLT-SPHERE
(Apai et al. 2016; Biller et al. 2021), reaching sensitivity
to variability with amplitudes down to 5% for periods <10
hours, but not yielding any detections to date.

4.4. State-of-the-Art Modeling of Imaged Exoplanets

4.4.1. Recent developments of 1D models

Much of our understanding of young giant exoplanet
atmospheres comes from the constraints the observations
described above place on atmosphere models. Atmo-
spheric models for directly imaged exoplanets and brown
dwarfs share a heritage with models for very low mass stars
(Chabrier et al. 2000; Baraffe et al. 2002; Burrows et al.
2003; Allard et al. 2012; Baraffe et al. 2015) and solar
system planets, building a self-consistent, one-dimensional
atmospheric structure connecting a fully convective interior
with a radiative atmosphere (“radiative-convective” model,
see review by Marley and Robinson 2015). However, the
cooler temperatures and lack of core H fusion for brown
dwarf and exoplanet atmospheres require a number of dif-
ferent “ingredients” compared to stars, most speciﬁcally,
a treatment of clouds and hazes in these atmospheres and
the ability to handle disequilibrium chemistry and vertical
mixing.

The very red colors observed for young planet-mass ob-
jects cannot be described by simple 1D models without
additional cloud or convection prescriptions (Marley et al.
2012). The most common parameterization used in model-
ing brown dwarf and giant exoplanet clouds utilizes a sedi-
mentation efﬁciency parameter fsed, which tunes cloud par-
ticles sizes necessary to balance vertical transport of con-
densible gases (e.g. the Eddysed grid presented in Acker-
man and Marley 2001). The Sonora model grid is an update
to the original Eddysed grid models, reaching cooler effec-
tive temperatures and a wider range of C/O values than the
earlier grids. To date, only the cloudless model grid is avail-
able (Marley et al. 2021), but grids incorporating a similar
fsed cloud parameterization should be available soon. The
ATMO 2020 models (Phillips et al. 2020) also provide a key
update to earlier grids, in particular, the COND and DUSTY
models of Baraffe et al. (2002), incorporating a new H-He
equation of state, updated molecular opacity, and an im-
proved treatment of the collisionally broadened potassium
resonance doublet. Finally, models like Exo-REM intro-
duce a self-consistent cloud model, with cloudy and clear
columns, a similar fsed method of cloud parameterization
(Charnay et al. 2018), and grids that consider non-solar
compositions (Nowak et al. 2020).

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

Canonical models utilize silicate dust clouds to describe
young exoplanet atmospheres, especially at the L/T transi-
tion. However, other work explores alternatives. For exam-
ple, Tremblin et al. (2016) propose that a thermo-chemical
instability producing an extra source of diabatic convention
can alter an atmosphere’s temperature-pressure proﬁle, pro-
viding another path to produce the observed red colors with-
out clouds (see also: Tremblin et al. 2017, 2019, 2020).

4.4.2.

Inversion techniques: achievements and challenges

The models discussed in Section 4.4.1 are full self-
consistent radiative-convective equilibrium models:
for-
ward models where the full 1D structure of the modeled
atmosphere is solved iteratively (similarly as with stellar
models). These models produce grids of synthetic planet
spectra exploring the impact of a limited set of model free-
parameters. The comparison of these models to observed
spectra is known as “forward modelling”.

Bayesian inference methods such as the Markov-Chain
Monte-Carlo method or the Nested sampling algorithm can
be coupled to precomputed grids of forward models to in-
terpret spectra. The method can account for correlated and
uncorrelated noise in the data and can estimate posterior
probability distributions on the model parameters and ev-
idence degeneracies between those parameters, thus iden-
tifying the sub-families of models that best represent the
data (Rice et al. 2010; Samland et al. 2017; Stolker et al.
2020; Zhang et al. 2021d). Recently proposed random for-
est algorithms are a more computationally rapid alternative
to the Bayesian framework and can provide information re-
garding the degree in which datapoints at given wavelengths
constrain a speciﬁc free-parameter of the model (e.g., Ore-
shenko et al. 2020).

if present.

Modern self-consistent forward models track both the ef-
fect of cloud condensates on the sequestration of atomic
species in the gas phase and the consequences of non-
equilibrium carbon chemistry,
If not prop-
erly treated, the presence of clouds and non-equilibrium
chemistry can lead to biased determination of bulk at-
mospheric compositions. Nonetheless, for self-consistent
models that carefully take into account these processes,
“forward modelling” can provide accurate ﬁts to medium-
resolution spectra of companions consisting of several thou-
sands of datapoints (see Figure 11). It however requires re-
interpolating the grids of models and relies on a number of
pre-determined sets of physical ingredients in the models.

The complementary “retrieval” approach starts from the
In this case, a parameter-
spectra and works backwards.
ized pressure-temperature proﬁle is adopted and other fun-
damental parameters (mass, effective temperature, cloud
properties, abundances, etc.) are then retrieved given the
observed spectrum by using Bayesian or random forest
techniques (Madhusudhan and Seager 2009). Retrievals
have been used extensively to interpret transiting exoplanet
spectra (see Madhusudhan 2018, for a recent review). In the
last few years, retreivals have also been applied to direct

spectroscopy of brown dwarfs (Line et al. 2017; Burning-
ham et al. 2017, 2021) and extrasolar giant planets (Lavie
et al. 2017; Molli`ere et al. 2020). However, retrieval ap-
proaches lose clear physical interpretations of the spectra.
This approach is still in its infancy and will gradually bene-
ﬁt from improvements made to forward models.

spectrum of HR8799 b from Barman et al. (2015) ﬁtted with the
Bayesian forward modeling code ForMoSA (Petrus et al. 2020,
2021) and the most recent self-consistent 1D models Exo-REM
(Charnay et al. 2018; Blain et al. 2021), exploring different abun-
dance values (C/O, M/H). The ﬁt provides a consistent representa-
tion of the spectral continuum and 12CO absorption, conﬁrms the
solar C/O ratio of the planet inferred in Barman et al. (2015) from
the same data, and matches well the C/O value measured for the
primary star (Wang et al. 2020).

4.4.3. The need for 3D models

The majority of modeling approaches for directly im-
aged exoplanet atmospheres are one-dimensional. How-
ever, high-amplitude, quasi-periodic variability detected in
both brown dwarfs and free-ﬂoating planetary mass objects
indicate signiﬁcant asymmetric top-of-atmosphere struc-
ture, often attributed to patchy thin and thick cloud cover
(Apai et al. 2013). (See Section 4.3 for additional details
on these observations.) Coupled with their relatively rapid
rotation rates which likely drive signiﬁcant winds, these are
dynamic and quickly varying atmospheres – and certainly
not one-dimensional. Full 3D general circulation modeling
(GCM) including a treatment of radiative transport is still
on the horizon for brown dwarfs and directly imaged gi-
ant exoplanets, but a number of groups have implemented
modeling approaches that take into account the signiﬁcantly
asymmetric top-of-atmosphere structure and strong atmo-
spheric circulation of these objects. Freytag et al. (2010)
use the CO5BOLD code to perform local, 2D radiation hy-
drodynamics simulations, incorporating dust clouds in the
atmospheres of late M stars and brown dwarfs and ﬁnd-
ing that convectively excited gravity waves are an essen-
tial mixing process in these atmospheres. For very cool

tion for each model atmosphere.
(2013) present three-dimensional, global, numerical simu-
lations of convection in the interior of brown dwarfs and di-
rectly imaged giant planets. These authors consider how the
temperature perturbations driven by this convection could
drive top-of-atmosphere asymmetry, in particular, allowing
patchy clouds to form near the photosphere of L-T tran-
sition brown dwarfs. Zhang and Showman (2014) use a
shallow water model to model the atmospheric circulation
driven by the rapid rotation of brown dwarfs and directly
imaged giant planets. Depending on the strength of the
heat ﬂux and radiative dissipation, they ﬁnd two circulation
regimes: 1) with strong internal heat ﬂux and weak radiative
dissipation, banded east-west jets will spontaneously form
and 2) with weak internal heat ﬂux and/or strong radiative
dissipation, vortices will instead form, potentially produc-
ing some of the “spotted” features found on brown dwarfs.
To constrain the effect of latent heating due to condensa-
tion on both cloud growth and top-of-atmosphere asymmet-
ric structure, Tan and Showman (2017) applied a idealized
general circulation model (GCM) including a condensation
cycle for silicate vapor. They found that simulations with
conditions appropriate for T dwarfs developed both local-
ized storms and east-west jets and that circulation driven by
the latent heating due to the condensation of silicate clouds
can generate large-scale cloud patchiness.
In a series of
recent papers, Tan and Showman have investigated a sec-
ond possible driver of short-time evolution of clouds and
thermal structures in brown dwarf, speciﬁcally, radiative
cloud feedback, ﬁrst within a 1D model (Tan and Showman
2019), then extending to a local 3D model (Tan and Show-
man 2021a), and ﬁnally extending to a full global geometry
model (Tan and Showman 2021b).

4.5. Connecting atmospheric chemical abundances to
exoplanet formation and migration histories

As seen in Sections 4.1.2 and 4.4.2, medium and
high-resolution spectroscopy, coupled with state-of-the-art
forward- and retrieval modeling approaches can measure
atmospheric chemical abundances for exoplanets, in partic-
ular, key tracer ratios such as C/O and 12CO / 13CO. The
composition of a given planet-forming disk will vary as a
function of radius, as various molecules (water, CO, CO2)
condense out into ices and form snow lines at progressively
greater distances in the disk. Thus, an exoplanet atmo-
sphere’s chemical composition will carry the imprint of
where in the circumstellar disk it ﬁrst formed and through
which parts of the disk it migrated before reaching its ﬁnal
¨Oberg and
orbital conﬁguration (e.g.
Wordsworth 2019; Madhusudhan 2019). The nature of this
imprint is challenging to describe end-to-end, from the pro-
tostellar cloud to the ﬁnal observed exoplanet atmosphere.
This requires a detailed understanding of the balance of

¨Oberg et al. 2011;

which species remain in gas phase vs. which condense into
solids, as well as the assumption that the ﬁnal atmospheric
gas composition of the planet will reﬂect the disk gas com-
position.

¨Oberg et al. (2011) made the ﬁrst prediction for the at-
mospheric chemical signatures for different formation his-
tories. For the canonical core accretion model, in which
a several Earth-mass rocky core is built up by the accu-
mulation of dust-to-boulder sized planetesimals and then
accretes disk gas and residual planetesimals5, jovian plan-
ets should have enhanced C/0∼1 if they accrete most of
their atmospheres from gas in the disk outside of the wa-
ter snowline. Using high-resolution Keck-OSIRIS spec-
troscopy, Konopacky et al. (2013) measured a super-stellar
C/O ratio for HR 8799 c, consistent with the ¨Oberg et al.
predictions for the core accretion scenario. Since this ﬁrst
measurement, C/O ratios have now been published for all
four HR 8799 planets, β Pic b, HIP 65426 b, and κ And b
(Lavie et al. 2017; Molli`ere et al. 2020; Wilcomb et al. 2020;
Wang et al. 2020; Gravity Collaboration et al. 2020; Petrus
et al. 2021; Rufﬁo et al. 2021). Discrepancies in values be-
tween early measurements and more recent measurements
(e.g. between Lavie et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2020) likely oc-
cur because higher spectral resolution measurements yield
more accurate C/O ratio measurements.

Interpreting C/O ratio measurements requires a careful
comparison to disk/formation model predictions relative to
different snowlines. To fully interpret C/O ratio measure-
ments, several of the observational studies considered above
also incorporate signiﬁcant disk modeling in their analysis
(cf. Molli`ere et al. 2020; Gravity Collaboration et al. 2020;
Petrus et al. 2021). The details of these comparisons are
beyond the scope of this article – see Madhusudhan (2019)
for a recent review.

A number of other elemental or isotopic ratios may yield
insight into the formation mechanisms / locations of young,
¨Oberg and Wordsworth (2019) suggest
giant exoplanets.
that the abundances of nitrogen-bearing species may also
trace the formation location of a given planet in the disk
( ¨Oberg and Wordsworth 2019). The 12CO / 13CO ratio may
also distinguish between “brown-dwarf” like and “planet-
like” formation scenarios (Zhang et al. 2021a,c).

5. Architectures of Directly Imaged Planetary Systems

5.1. Orbits and Dynamics

Given their long orbital periods, directly imaged planets
are not currently amenable to rapid orbital characterization.
At least one years’ worth of astrometric measurements are
typically required in order to place initial constraints on the
parameters of the visual orbits of planets that have been de-
tected thus far (e.g., Pearce et al. 2015; Blunt et al. 2017).
In fact, no planet yet discovered via direct imaging has a
“closed” orbit, i.e. with relative astrometric measurements
covering the full phase of the orbit. Despite the challenges

5Planet formation models are discussed extensively in Section 6.4.

19

Currie, Biller, Lagrange et al.

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

grange et al. 2020; Brandt et al. 2021b). Continued moni-
toring of these systems is warranted to investigate not only
their dynamical stability given revisions to their orbits and
estimated masses, but also the inﬂuence of the planets on
the structure of any resolved circumstellar material in each
system (see Section 5.2).

Early astrometry of β Pic b quickly revealed a near-edge
on orbit for the planet conﬁguration (Lagrange et al. 2010),
consistent with an edge-on inclination of the resolved de-
bris disk (Smith and Terrile 1984). While geometrical argu-
ments show that a long-period planet like β Pic b will likely
not transit, a photometric event measured in 1981 showed a
signiﬁcant variation in the star’s brightness (Lecavelier Des
Etangs et al. 1997), consistent with an eclipse of the star by
the planet or its Hill sphere based on the ephemeris avail-
able at the time (Chauvin et al. 2012). Continued astromet-
ric monitoring ruled out a planetary transit but demonstrated
that the Hill sphere would transit the star in mid-to-late 2017
(Wang et al. 2016). An extensive photometric and spectro-
scopic campaign ensued to measure, or place stringent lim-
its on, circumplanetary material as the Hill sphere transited.
No signiﬁcant event was detected: the 1981 event was prob-
ably not linked to the transit of an extended circumplanetary
disk (Mol Lous et al. 2018; van Sluijs et al. 2019; Kenwor-
thy et al. 2021). Despite this null detection, exo-cometary
material not within the β Pic b Hill sphere has been detected
transiting the star with TESS (Zieba et al. 2019, Lecavleier
et al 2022 in press), suggesting that the earlier photometric
variability could also be due to material not associated with
the planet.

Monitoring efforts are also ongoing for the the orbits
of planets within single-planet systems (e.g., Maire et al.
2019; Kammerer et al. 2021). In addition to providing con-
straints on the basic orbit geometry, these monitoring efforts
offer the potential for future dynamical mass measurements
when combined with absolute astrometry or radial velocity
measurements of the host star or planet (see Section 3.5).
The orbit geometries of imaged planets within single-planet
systems have been used to infer the presence of additional
companions. Rameau et al. (2016) compared the predicted
range of periastron and apastron distances of HD 95086 b
to the radial extent of the two circumstellar debris disks in
this system between which the planet resides (Mo´or et al.
2013; Su et al. 2015). Their analysis suggested that HD
95086 b does not have a sufﬁciently large eccentricity to be
responsible for truncating the outer edge of the inner debris
disk. Instead, an additional massive planet is required on a
shorter orbital period, one that lies below the current sensi-
tivity limits for this star. In other systems, a signiﬁcant non-
zero eccentricity may provide evidence for interior massive
companions due to their effect on the relative astrometry
between the star and the outer imaged planet (e.g., Maire
et al. 2019). Continued astrometric monitoring will differ-
entiate between a true non-zero eccentricity and a spurious
detection caused by the perturbation of an inner companion.
Comparing the orbital geometry of planets to those of
brown dwarfs and stars may can probe of the formation

wise, that are consistent with the data.

associated with the analyses of these incomplete datasets,
a great deal of information can still be learned regarding
the orbits of imaged exoplanets, and the architectures of the
planetary systems in which they reside.

The HR 8799 system is probably the best-studied system
in terms of simulations of its dynamical conﬁguration and
long-term stability (Fabrycky and Murray-Clay 2010; Cur-
rie et al. 2011; Sudol and Haghighipour 2012; Go´zdziewski
and Migaszewski 2014; G¨otberg et al. 2016; Go´zdziewski
and Migaszewski 2018; Wang et al. 2018). The four plan-
ets’ astrometric measurements are consistent with a co-
planar conﬁguration in, or close to, a 1:2:4:8 period ra-
tio (Figure 12; Go´zdziewski and Migaszewski 2018; Wang
et al. 2018). Integrating the system forward (or backward)
demonstrates that such a conﬁguration is dynamically sta-
ble, at least for many multiples of the current age of the
system (Go´zdziewski and Migaszewski 2018). While a res-
onance between the four planets is not necessary for long-
term stability, resonances between pairs of the inner plan-
ets are required if their masses are (cid:38) 6MJup (Wang et al.
2018). In addition to testing the dynamical stability of the
system, these simulations have also been used to investigate
the parameter space in which additional planets could ex-
ist in a stable conﬁguration (Go´zdziewski and Migaszewski
2018), either interior to the innermost known planet or in
a wide orbit dynamically sculpting the outer debris disk
(Booth et al. 2016; Read et al. 2018).

The dynamical stability of the other known multi-planet
systems (β Pic, PDS 70, and TYC 8998) have not yet been
studied at the same level of detail. Their astrometric mea-
surements are consistent with a dynamically stable conﬁg-
uration given the masses derived from either evolutionary
models (Wang et al. 2021; Bohn et al. 2020b), or from com-
bined astrometric and radial velocity measurements (La-

has used the measured misalignment between the planet’s
orbit, rotation and stellar spin axes as an empirical test of
various formation mechanisms and dynamical processes.
Differences between planet and brown dwarf eccentricity
distributions may also probe formation mechanisms (see
Section 6.4; Bowler et al. 2020a).

5.2. Planet-Disk Interactions

The many main sequence stars with IR excess found in
the 1980s to 2000s by the IRAS, ISO, and Spitzer mis-
sions along with early resolved images of disks provided
evidence for numerous, nearby optically thin, Kuiper belt-
like debris disks that may be nascent planetary systems
(e.g. Backman and Paresce 1993; Smith and Terrile 1984).
Pluto-sized objects in these exo-Kuiper belts stir collisions
between planetesimals to produce copious debris; stirring
may also be driven by massive jovian planets (Kenyon and
Bromley 2004, 2008; Kennedy and Wyatt 2010). These
same missions showed evidence for numerous transitional
protoplanetary disks whose spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) suggested cleared cavities or gaps (e.g. Espaillat
et al. 2007; Luhman and Mamajek 2012, , see Sect. 3.2).

Resolved images of debris and transitional disks reveal
tell-tale signposts of planets (Figure 13). Images of tran-
sitional disks resolve cavities inferred from SEDs and/or
show spiral density waves plausibly due to massive jo-
vian companions. For example, the disk around MWC 758
shows a complex two-armed spiral structure extending from
∼ 25 au to over 100 au (Benisty et al. 2015); AB Aur’s
disk shows signiﬁcant spiral structure on both tens of au
and 100 au scales, some of which may be driven by AB
Aur b (Hashimoto et al. 2012; Tang et al. 2017; Currie
et al. 2022). The PDS 70 disk has a cavity likely cleared
by the system’s two protoplanets (e.g. Keppler et al. 2018;
Haffert et al. 2019). Recent work suggests that actively-
forming planets could be responsible for gaps, rings, and
spirals seen in transitional disks (e.g. Dong et al. 2015a,b),

although some structure (e.g. spirals) could instead be due
to gravitational instabilities.

Imaged debris disks may show sharp edges and pericen-
ter offsets caused by the dynamical perturbations from a
jovian planet located interior (Kalas et al. 2005). Modeling
the sharp edges of disks may help constrain the masses of
planets (e.g. Kalas et al. 2008). Warps in debris disks are
also likely planetary signposts: modeling the warps in some
cases can constrain planet masses (Lagrange et al. 2009).

Finally, mm imaging of highly structured transitional
disks may reveal indirect kinematic detection of planets or
circumplanetary material. Benisty et al. (2021) image a cir-
cumplanetary disk around PDS 70 c. ALMA data for HD
163296 and HD 97048 may show an indirect kinematic de-
tection of protoplanets that currently elude direct detection
via local deviations from Keplerian rotation (kinks) (Pinte
et al. 2018; Teague et al. 2018; Pinte et al. 2019).

6. Direct Imaging Surveys and Population Statistics

Most of the known directly imaged exoplanets were dis-
covered as part of large AO surveys. New planet detections
and characterization of existing planets via photometry and
spectroscopy is only one part of the yield of such surveys;
current surveys cover samples of 500-600 stars down to ex-
cellent contrasts and yield precise information as to where
giant exoplanets reside in planetary systems. While the new
detection yield of these surveys has been relatively small,
the deep contrasts probed enable robust studies of the fre-
quency of wide (>20 au) young giant planets.

6.1. Survey Target Selection

Direct imaging exoplanet surveys to date have focused
primarily on stars drawn from the following samples: 1)
Young Moving Groups (MG): as discussed in Section 3,
these groups of stars share similar kinematics and origi-
nated in the same star-forming region. The ongoing Gaia
mission is helping ﬁll in the low mass stellar members of

Fig. 14.— Selected high-contrast imaging results for systems in
the Sco-Cen Association: (top) The directly-imaged wide separa-
tion companions TYC 8998-760-1 bc (∼160 and 320 au; denoted
by arrows), and (bottom) the HD 106906 debris disk (Bohn et al.
2021; Lagrange et al. 2016). HD 106906 also has a much wider-
separation planet-mass companion (Bailey et al. 2014).

these groups (e.g. Gagn´e et al. 2018b, 2021). Some notable
moving groups that have been surveyed in depth by direct
imaging surveys include: the β Pic MG, the AB Dor MG,
the Tucana-Horologium MG, and the Sco-Cen association.
2) Young Star-forming regions (SFR): these are re-
gions with active ongoing star-formation and probe the ear-
liest stages of planet formation (<10 M yr) (see Reipurth
2008a,b). Notable SFRs targeted for direct imaging in-
clude Taurus, Ophiuchus, Chamaeleon, Perseus, and Ser-
pens. SFRs are excellent regions to search for protoplan-
ets. They have generally been less surveyed than MGs due
to their greater distances and confusion between exoplanet
and disk signals. There is also some overlap between SFR
and MG designations, with boundary cases such as TW Hya
and Upper Scorpius within the larger Sco-Cen association
(Song et al. 2012; Pecaut et al. 2012).

3) The Sco-Cen niche: Direct imaging programs fo-
cusing on the 14± 3 Myr (Pecaut et al. 2012) Scorpius-
Centaurus association have proven particularly fruitful,
yielding a much higher rate of exoplanet detections com-
pared to other young moving group surveys. At a distance
of ∼100–150 pc, Sco-Cen is the closest OB association
(massive star-forming region) to the Sun and contains over
one thousand young stars, well over 100 of which show
some indirect evidence for active planet formation (Luh-
man and Mamajek 2012). It is intermediate in properties
between 10-100 Myr-old moving groups and <10 Myr-old
embedded young star-forming regions.

Figure 14 shows some direct imaging results from this
region. Sco-Cen includes multiple directly imaged planets
and protoplanets orbiting less than ∼300 au from Sco-Cen
host stars: HD 95086 b (Rameau et al. 2013b), HIP 65426 b
(Chauvin et al. 2017), PDS 70 bc (Keppler et al. 2018; Haf-
fert et al. 2019), and YSES 2b (Bohn et al. 2021). The re-
gion also includes a large number of other wide-separation
planet-mass companions or objects with masses near the
deuterium burning limit and mass ratios well below q ∼ 0.1
(e.g. Bohn et al. 2020b; Bailey et al. 2014, TYC 8998-760-
1 bc and HD 106906 b). Follow-up observations of many
Sco-Cen members stars with ground-based extreme AO and
ALMA spatially resolve numerous debris disks and transi-
tional disks (e.g. Lagrange et al. 2016; Garuﬁ et al. 2016;

Draper et al. 2016). The disks often show structures (spi-
rals, gaps, arc) that can indicate the presence of formed or
forming planets (see Sect. 5.2).

4) Debris disk-bearing stars: debris disks may be sign-
posts of imageable giant planets (see Section 5). The ﬁrst
two directly-imaged planetary systems – HR 8799 and β
Pic – both have luminous debris disks. Debris disk-selected
surveys like Rameau et al. (2013a); Meshkat et al. (2017)
target young, nearby stars whose debris disks have a high
fractional luminosity (e.g. 10−4–10−3)6.

5) A and B stars: these massive stars have short life-
times, so any companion to them must by deﬁnition be
young (<200 Myr). Statistical results from several sur-
veys show that substellar and exoplanet companions to A
and B stars are indeed more common than similar compan-
ions to lower mass FGKM stars (e.g. Nielsen et al. 2019,
see also 6.3).

6) Accelerating Stars: unlike the categories of stars dis-
cussed above which are selected primarily due to signs of
youth, this category of stars show indirect evidence for the
dynamical pull from an unseen companion. While such
targeted surveys cannot provide unbiased demographic in-
vestigations of exoplanets, they can produce signiﬁcantly
higher yields than blind surveys (e.g. Crepp et al. 2016).
Some surveys, speciﬁcally TRENDS, focused on stars with
long-term RV trends indicating the presence of an unseen
companion (e.g. Crepp et al. 2012, 2018), discovering a
number of brown dwarfs, low-mass stars, and white dwarf
companions. A key challenge with this approach is that
stars with sufﬁciently low chromospheric activity to yield
good RV precision tend to be old and thus poorer direct
imaging targets.

More recently, several groups have begun using astro-
metric data to select direct imaging targets. This method
is immune from the age selection bias that plagues RV-
selected target lists. For an isolated star, the proper motion
values measured by Hipparcos and Gaia should be identical.
However, the tug of an unseen faint companion will cause
the position of the primary to diverge slightly from what
would be expected for an isolated star (modulated by the
orbital period of the companion). Differences in proper mo-
tions measured between the Hipparcos and Gaia missions
thus reveal accelerations plausibly caused by unseen plane-
tary companions (Kervella et al. 2019; Brandt 2018, 2021;
Fontanive et al. 2019). While in its infancy, this approach is
promising, already revealing brown dwarf companions and
a handful of white dwarfs (Currie et al. 2020b; Bonavita
et al. 2020; Bowler et al. 2021). It is capable of identify-
ing hidden planetary companions: HR 8799, β Pic, and HD
206893 all have proper motion anomalies caused by known
planetary companions (Brandt et al. 2021b; Nielsen et al.
2019; Grandjean et al. 2021). The modest astrometric pre-
cision of Hipparcos limits the current inventory of stars with

6While (Meshkat et al. 2017) ﬁnd evidence of a correlation between im-
aged planets and debris disks, debris disks may not correlate with planets
detected by RV (Yelverton et al. 2020).

22

Currie, Biller, Lagrange et al.

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

detectable accelerations likely caused by planets. However,
future Gaia data releases should signiﬁcantly expand the
list of known stars whose accelerations may be caused by
imageable planets.

6.2. Summary of Surveys

Since the advent of ground-based AO-enabled imaging
and space-based imaging with HST, there have been several
generations of direct-imaging exoplanet surveys:

1. Generation 1: AO-enabled and HST efforts, 2000-
2005 (i.e. the state-of-the-art at Protostars and Plan-
ets V, the last Protostar and Planets conference with
a direct imaging chapter). Typical sample size: <50
stars. Typical contrast: ∆(mag) ∼ 8 at 0.5”. Ex-
amples: Masciadri et al. (2005) (VLT), Chauvin
et al. (2003) (ESO 3.6 m, Tuc/Hor moving group),
Lowrance et al. (2005) (HST).

2. Generation 2: 8-m class telescope + AO + speckle
suppression techniques (but no coronagraphy). Typ-
ical sample size: 50-100 stars. Typical contrast:
∆(mag) ∼ 10 at 0.5”. Examples: Biller et al. (2007)
(VLT and MMT), Lafreni`ere et al. (2007b) (Gemini),
Chauvin et al. (2010) (VLT).

3. Generation 3: 8-m class telescope + AO + speckle
suppression techniques + coronagraphy.
Typi-
cal sample size: 100-300 stars. Typical contrast:
∆(mag) ∼ 11 − 12 at 0.5”. Examples: NaCo
Large Programme: Desidera et al. (2015); Chau-
vin et al. (2015); Vigan et al. (2017), NICI Sci-
ence Campaign: Biller et al. (2013); Wahhaj et al.
(2013); Nielsen et al. (2013), International Deep
Planet Search (IDPS): Vigan et al. (2012); Galicher
et al. (2016), SEEDS: Tamura (2016); Brandt et al.
(2014); Janson et al. (2013), PALMS: Bowler et al.
(2012a,b, 2015), LEECH: Skemer et al. (2014b);
Maire et al. (2015); Stone et al. (2018).

4. Generation 4: 8-m class telescope + extreme AO +
sophisticated speckle suppression techniques + coro-
nagraphy. Typical sample size: 500-600 stars. Typ-
ical contrast: ∆(mag) ∼ 13 − 14 at 0.5”, using
custom-built extreme-AO coronagraphs with spec-
troscopic capability (due to their IFS detectors). Ex-
amples: Gemini-GPIES (Nielsen et al. 2019) and
SPHERE-SHINE (Vigan et al. 2021; Desidera et al.
2021; Langlois et al. 2021). Several smaller, tar-
geted surveys are ongoing alongside the large Gen-
eration 4 surveys – such as the Search for Planets
Orbiting Two Stars SPOTS (Thalmann et al. 2014;
Bonavita et al. 2016; Asensio-Torres et al. 2018),
the B-star Exoplanet Abundance Study (BEAST)
(Janson et al. 2019, 2021), the Young Suns Exo-
planet Survey (YSES) (Bohn et al. 2020a,b, 2021),
the SCExAO/CHARIS HGCA survey (Currie et al.
2020b), and the Imaging Survey for Planets around
Young stars (ISPY) (Launhardt et al. 2020).

In aggregate,

these surveys typically detect ∼1 sub-
stellar or exoplanet companion per 100 stars (e.g. meta-
analyses by Bowler 2016; Bowler and Nielsen 2018), al-
though targeted surveys (e.g. focused on accelerating stars)
may produce higher yields.

Most of the direct imaging surveys described above have
focused on planet detection in the near-IR, especially near
H band. However, some surveys – e.g. LEECH and ISPY
(Heinze et al. 2010; Skemer et al. 2014b; Launhardt et al.
2020) – have searched in the thermal IR, in particular the
Lp passband (3.78 µm). For a given residual wavefront
error, the Strehl ratio is signiﬁcantly higher in the thermal
IR than in the near IR. As shown in Figure 3, contrasts are
more advantageous in the thermal IR for both young and
(especially) intermediate-aged jovian planets. The planets
β Pic b and HR 8799 e were chieﬂy discovered from ther-
mal IR data; discovery papers for other planets (e.g. PDS
70 b) also included thermal IR imaging (Lagrange et al.
2009; Marois et al. 2010a; Keppler et al. 2018). The ther-
mal IR has lower background star contamination compared
to the near-IR. Extreme AO systems can detect planets 100
times fainter than conventional AO counterparts in the near-
IR (Macintosh et al. 2014). However, thus far, extreme AO
in the near IR has a smaller (factor of ∼ a few) advantage
over a conventional AO system operating in the thermal IR
(e.g. see GPI/H band vs. Keck/thermal IR detections of 51
Eri b; Macintosh et al. 2015).

6.3. Occurrence Rates and Demographics

The planet occurrence rate (number of planets per star) –
and how that occurrence rate varies as a function of stellar
or planetary properties (e.g. host mass, planet mass, orbital
semi-major axis, host star metallicity) – strongly constrains
models of planet formation and evolution, particularly as
we build up larger sample sizes. Early demographics stud-
ies focused on RV survey results, showing correlations in
giant exoplanet occurrence with stellar metallicity (Fischer
and Valenti 2005) and host star mass (Johnson et al. 2007),
and constraining occurrence rates as a function of planet
mass and semi-major axis (Cumming et al. 2008). In partic-
ular, Cumming et al. (2008) found a power-law dependence
of planet period that corresponded to a rising occurrence
rate of giant planets as a function of log semi-major axis
out to ∼2.5 au.

Given the low yield of exoplanets from early direct imag-
ing surveys, detailed occurrence rate measurements proved
difﬁcult. Instead, Generation 1 and 2 survey analyses fo-
cused on constraining occurrence rates with assumed mass
and semi-major axis distributions, or setting upper limits on
the largest semi-major axis for which the Cumming et al.
(2008) power law could be consistent with direct imaging
yields (e.g. Masciadri et al. 2005; Lafreni`ere et al. 2007b;
Nielsen and Close 2010). These early results showed that
the occurrence rate of giant planets ((cid:38)1 MJ ) in wide orbits
((cid:38)10 AU) was relatively low ((cid:46)10%), and that the rising
power law of Cumming et al. (2008) cannot extend beyond

23

Currie, Biller, Lagrange et al.

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

tens of au and still be consistent with the lower occurrence
rates found by direct imaging surveys.

Starting with the ﬁrst imaged planet discoveries in 2008
(Marois et al. 2008b; Lagrange et al. 2009), it became pos-
sible for surveys to directly measure occurrence rates, rather
than simply placing upper limits. A planet of a given mass
and separation should be easier to image around a low lumi-
nosity, low-mass star than a higher luminosity, high-mass
star. However, hosts (e.g. HR 8799, β Pic) of directly-
imaged wide-separation giant planets were typically more
massive than the Sun (∼1.5–2 M(cid:12)).

As Generation 3 surveys reached higher contrasts than
their predecessors, giant planets with masses down to ∼2
MJup became detectable at separations above ∼50 au (be-
yond ∼1(cid:48)(cid:48)) for nearby moving group stars. Yields from
these surveys remained low, however, typically 0-2 plan-
ets per survey. Given the limited number of nearby young
stars, the same planet was often detected by multiple sur-
veys (e.g. β Pictoris b, κ And b). Occurrence rate analysis
conﬁrmed the relatively low upper limits implied by Gen-
eration 1 and 2 surveys, with (cid:46)10% of nearby, young stars
hosting a wide-separation giant planet. Analysis of occur-
rence rate as a function of stellar mass from these Gener-
ation 3 surveys conﬁrmed that wide-separation giant plan-
ets do not follow an extrapolation of the Cumming et al.
(2008) power laws. Wide-separation jovian planets were
also found to be more common around higher-mass stars
(e.g. Lannier et al. 2016). Wide-separation giant planet oc-
currence rates may also be higher for stars with Kuiper belt-
like debris disks than diskless stars (Meshkat et al. 2017).

Generation 4 surveys have signiﬁcantly higher sensitiv-
ity to giant planets between ∼10-50 au compared to pre-
vious generations of surveys, due to improved corongraphs
and AO. These surveys had larger survey sizes, and detected
planets at separations and contrasts not reachable with pre-
vious instrumentation (e.g. 51 Eridani b at ∼2 MJ and
∼13 au). Higher yields of substellar companions meant
more detailed demographic studies became possible, with
the ﬁrst analysis of GPIES data detecting 3 brown dwarfs
and 6 giant planets, and the ﬁrst SHINE demographic anal-
ysis ﬁnding 8 giant planets and 7 brown dwarfs (Figure 15).
These surveys conﬁrmed at ∼3σ that wide-separation giant
planets (2-13 MJ at 10-100 au) had higher occurrence rates
around higher-mass ((cid:38)1.5 M(cid:12)) stars compared to Solar-
type stars (Vigan et al. 2021; Nielsen et al. 2019).

These higher planet yields also allowed constraints the
occurrence rate of wide-separation giant planets as a func-
tion of semi-major axis, planet mass, and stellar host mass.
Power law ﬁts to the occurrence rates of wide-separation
giant planets as a function of these parameters show that
the giant planet occurrence rate at 10-100 au rises with in-
creasing stellar mass, decreasing planet mass, and decreas-
ing semi-major axis (Nielsen et al. 2019). Comparing the
power-law ﬁts for giant planets brown dwarfs suggests that
planets and brown dwarfs are not drawn from the same pop-
ulation at wider separations, consistent with separate for-
mation mechanisms (Nielsen et al. 2019). When combined

Fig. 15.— Tongue plots showing detections and sensitivities to
substellar companions for the GPIES (top) and SHINE (bottom)
surveys. Unlike previous generations of surveys, these surveys
could detect giant planets as close as ∼10 au from their parent star
(Figure 4 of Nielsen et al. 2019, Figure 1 of Vigan et al. 2021).

with results from RV surveys at smaller separations, the dis-
tribution of giant planets as a function of semi-major axis
also appears (Figure 16) consistent with a peak at 3-10 au,
near the snow line, with falling occurrence rates at smaller
and larger separations.

RV population studies like Fernandes et al. (2019) and
Fulton et al. (2021) are now sensitive to giant planets be-
yond the snow line. Both studies ﬁnd a peak in the giant
planet occurrence rate near the snow line. The frequency
of planets with masses of 5-14 MJ between 10-100 au ex-
trapolated from the Fulton et al. (2021) RV study is in ex-
cellent agreement with the same measurement (in the same
mass and separation bins) from the Gemini-GPIES survey

2. Gravitational Instability within a Disk – If a disk is
sufﬁciently massive to experience self-gravity, parts
of the disk can undergo fragmentation and quickly
form giant planets (cf. Kuiper 1951; Boss 1998;
Vorobyov et al. 2013; Forgan and Rice 2013; Forgan
et al. 2015). Kratter et al. (2010) note that in most
cases, these fragment-formed companions will grow
further into substellar or low mass stellar compan-
ions – only the lowest mass members of this cohort
remain planetary.

For very low mass primaries (e.g.

brown dwarfs),
binary-like formation can also produce planetary mass com-
panions (Offner et al. 2010). This is the probable formation
mechanism for the brown dwarf - planetary mass binary
2M1207 B (Chauvin et al. 2004), for instance.

Giant planets observed at wide separations experience
signiﬁcant migration or scattering either during their for-
mation or immediately afterwards (Morbidelli et al. 2009;
Johansen and Lambrechts 2017; Forgan et al. 2018; Emsen-
huber et al. 2021). Exoplanet demographics from large sur-
veys provide critical tests as to which of these formation and
migration mechanisms are dominant, as different formation
mechanisms place planets in very different parts of their
stellar system. Gravitational instability predicts giant plan-
ets generally at wider separations, with more higher-mass
planets than lower-mass ones, and no strong dependence on
stellar mass. Core accretion, on the other hand, predicts
more giant planets closer to the star and more lower-mass
planets than higher-mass ones. Figure 17 shows a compari-
son of simulated planet populations formed via core accre-
tion (Ida et al. 2013) against a population formed via disk
instability (Forgan et al. 2015). Both of these studies simu-
late multiple planetary embryos per system; after an initial
formation phase, both model populations undergo an evo-
lution phase where they can scatter or be scattered by other
objects in their system. Obviously this is comparing just
two simulation codes and a wide variety of similar popula-
tions exist in the literature 7. However, while the exact pop-
ulation simulated by each team and model considered will
vary, the hallmarks of each formation mechanism remain.

In the last decade, a number of large direct imaging sur-
veys have used results from these types of population syn-
thesis codes to inform their statistical analyses. Informed
by theoretical results, Janson et al. (2011, 2012); Rameau
et al. (2013a) deﬁne regions in mass-semi-major axis space
where gravitational instability formation would be possible.
Given non-detections in these mass - semi-major axis re-
gions in their surveys, they were then able to set upper limits
on the frequency of giant planets formed via gravitational
instability. Vigan et al. (2017) found that the disk instabil-
ity population could describe the companions detected in
their survey, but only if formation by disk instability was
relatively rare. Comparisons of core accretion population

Formation Theory in the Era of ALMA and Kepler: From Pebbles to Exo-
planets”.

Fig. 16.— Occurrence rate of giant planets (5-13 MJup), brown
dwarfs (13-80 MJup), and substellar companions (5-80 MJup) from
multiple direct direct imaging and radial velocity surveys. Gi-
ant planets around higher-mass stars (top left panel) and around
all stellar types (top right panel) are consistent with a peak in
the distribution near the snow line (∼3-10 au), with falling oc-
currence rates toward larger and smaller separations. Current de-
mographics results provide robust evidence that giant planets are
more common around higher-mass stars, and weaker evidence that
giant planets and brown dwarfs follow different underlying distri-
butions. (Figure 8 of Nielsen et al. (2019))

(Nielsen et al. 2019). Taken together, results from imaging
and RV imply a giant planet occurrence rate (across all sep-
arations) of ∼20% (Fulton et al. 2021) for Sun-like stars,
and potentially signiﬁcantly higher for giant planets around
higher-mass stars (Nielsen et al. 2019).

6.4. Testing Formation Mechanisms with Direct Imag-

ing Exoplanet Demographics

The demographics of directly-imaged planets can pro-
vide powerful constraints on their likely formation mecha-
nism. There are two main pathways by which giant planets
may form:

1. Core Accretion – a rocky core accretes ﬁrst from
planetesimals,
followed by a gas envelope (cf.
Mizuno 1980; Pollack et al. 1996; Alibert et al. 2004;
Ida et al. 2013). The proto-planet’s position within
the disk will eventually determine its ﬁnal mass; for
instance, Jupiter, closer to the peak density of the
Sun’s protoplanetary disk, managed to accrete a con-
siderably larger gas envelope than Neptune. Pebble
accretion can enhance the protoplanetary accretion
rate, enabling the formation of massive planets far
from their star (for a review, see Johansen and Lam-
brechts 2017).

Currie, Biller, Lagrange et al.

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

synthesis models to direct imaging surveys before the ad-
vent of Gemini-GPI and SPHERE-SHINE (e.g. Nielsen and
Close 2010; Chauvin et al. 2015; Vigan et al. 2017) did not
yield meaningful constraints as most of the predicted core-
accretion planets were undetectable for these surveys.

Statistical results from the Gemini- GPIES and SPHERE-
SHINE surveys (Nielsen et al. 2019; Vigan et al. 2021) sug-
gest that core accretion is the dominant mechanism form-
ing directly imaged giant planets. Nielsen et al. (2019)
compared the power-law ﬁt to 10-100 AU giant planets
detected in the GPIES survey to predictions of both gravita-
tional instability and core accretion. While the brown dwarf
companion population was well-described by gravitational
instability, Nielsen et al. (2019) found giant planets closer
to their star in comparison to the brown dwarf companions,
with more lower-mass planets than higher-mass planets,
and with a higher frequency of planets around higher mass
stars in the samples – all hallmarks of core accretion. Fitting
both disk instability and core accretion populations(Forgan
et al. 2018; Mordasini et al. 2017) simultaneously to the de-
tected companions and contrast limits of a sample of FGK
stars observed as part of the SPHERE-SHINE F150 sample,
Vigan et al. (2021) qualitatively found that the contribution
of the core accretion simulated population is larger than
the contribution of the gravitational instability simulated
population, suggesting that core accretion is the dominant
formation mechanism for this sample as well.

Directly imaged giant exoplanets are numerous enough
to study the demographics of companions themselves,
rather than only from detection statistics across a survey.
For instance, Bowler et al. (2020a) considered eccentrici-
ties of 27 long-period giant planets and brown dwarf com-
panions between 5 and 100 au, derived from their own
orbital ﬁts to literature and additional Keck astrometry.
They tentatively found (∼2-σ) that their popuation dom-
inated by giant planets (2-15 MJ ) had somewhat lower
orbital eccentricities than a brown dwarf-dominated pop-
ulation (15-75 MJ ), which displayed a broad distribution
of eccentricities with a peak in eccentricity between 0.6
and 0.9. These population-wide differences in eccentricity
may suggest different formaiton mechanisms for the two
populations: formation within a disk for directly-imaged
exoplanets vs. cloud fragmentation (binary-like formation)
for brown dwarf companions.

7. The Future of Direct Imaging

Over the next 5 years, new technology applied to exo-
planet imaging instruments from the ground will close the
gap between the planets we can image and those we have
detected indirectly, while JWST will enable the detection
of planets undetectable from the ground. By 2030, new fa-
cilities should provide the ﬁrst reﬂected-light detections and
spectral characterizations of mature planets. Finally, by the
2040s, we should be able to directly detect rocky, habitable
zone planets around the nearest M stars and Sun-like stars
using ELTs and NASA/ESA ﬂagship missions.

paring simulated population of companions formed via core ac-
cretion (blue/green Ida et al. 2013) and gravitational instability
(red/yellow Forgan et al. 2015). Lighter colors represents higher
occurrence rates. Histograms of the distributions for each model
population in semi-major axis (au) and mass (MJ ) are shown on
the top and side respectively. Mean detection probabilities and
the detected companions from the Vigan et al. (2017) sample are
overplotted as black contours and points respectively. Both of
these simulated populations include multiple planetary embryos
per system; both model populations undergo an evolution phase
where they can scatter or be scattered by other objects in their sys-
tem. Nonetheless, disk instability predominantly forms massive
companions (1-100 MJ far from the star, whereas core accretion
dominates within 10 au and predominantly produces lower mass
companions.

In this section, we project the near, medium, and long-
term development of direct imaging through technological
innovation.We describe as well new facilities applying these
innovations and the science questions we will begin to an-
swer via these new capabilities.

7.1. New Tools

The hardware enabling current high contrast imaging ca-
pabilities described in §2.2.1 – detectors, deformable mir-
rors, high performance computing – will continue to ad-
vance and provide deeper contrast levels. Improved coro-
nagraph designs will also open access to planets at separa-
tions near the telescope diffraction limit. For ground-based
extreme AO these incremental gains are being implemented
in instruments on current large telescopes, either as part
of a continuous development process (SCExAO, MagAO-
X, KPIC Guyon et al. 2020; Close et al. 2018; Males et al.
2020; Echeverri et al. 2019; Mawet 2021), or major up-
grades to existing facility instruments (GPI-2.0, SPHERE+
Chilcote et al. 2020; Boccaletti et al. 2020). The same hard-
ware technologies are at the core of future ground and space
instrument designs, and will provide science capability im-
provements beyond the already signiﬁcant gains expected
from re-deploying current instruments on larger telescopes.

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

Advances in low-noise detectors and optical ﬁber tech-
nologies will enable exoplanet spectroscopy at high spectral
resolution. Early on-sky demonstration (KPIC, REACH,
Mawet 2021; Kotani et al. 2020) are paving the way for
more capable future systems (MODHIS, Dumas 2020). Po-
larization differential imaging systems optimized for high
contrast imaging (ZIMPOL, VAMPIRES, Schmid et al.
2018; Norris et al. 2020), when deployed on largest tele-
scopes, will be able to reveal partially polarized starlight
reﬂected by exoplanet atmospheres.

Upcoming transformative advances in wavefront con-
trol, calibration, and starlight suppression will yield order-
of-magnitude level improvement in contrast, or enable new
measurement capabilities. These include:

• Sensor fusion and predictive control will optimize
how real-time wavefront sensing telemetry is used to
estimate wavefront errors. In predictive control, cur-
rent and past measurements are combined to extrapo-
late future optimal AO commands, reducing time lag
errors and improving sensitivity (Males and Guyon
2018). By combining information from multiple sen-
sors operating at separate wavelengths or in different
optical conﬁgurations, the precision and accuracy of
wavefront estimates should also be further improved
(Guyon et al. 2020).

• PSF calibration from real-time telemetry holds the
potential to numerically subtract starlight from sci-
ence images at the photon noise level (Gilles et al.
2011; Guyon et al. 2020).

• Coherent modulation can provide a real-time esti-
mate of starlight, which can then be numerically re-
moved from science images. The modulation can be
performed spatially in a self-coherent camera (Bau-
doz et al. 2006), or temporally with coherent differ-
ential imaging.

• Photonic technologies provide new ways to ﬁlter,
transport and combine light (Gatkine et al. 2019).
Applications include ﬁber-fed spectroscopy, wave-
front sensing, and nulling interferometry (Jovanovic
et al. 2020; Norris et al. 2020; Martinod et al. 2021).

• Laser beacons can improve wavefront control per-
formance beyond the fundamental limits imposed by
starlight photon noise. The approach has been suc-
cessfully used for non-extreme AO ground-based ob-
servations, and is now being considered for both
ground-based and space based (Douglas et al. 2019)
high contrast imaging applications.

• Starshades can provide high contrast imaging with-
out requiring exquisite optical stability. They are
particularly well-suited for long exposure wide spec-
tral coverage spectroscopy of exoplanets with space-
based telescopes (Gaudi et al. 2020).

ﬂected light using an extreme AO planet-ﬁnding camera at an ELT.

tion in Perryman et al. 2014), Bottom: known RV planets. The

(Kasper et al. 2010), but is representative of the performance ex-
pected for similar instruments on ELTs. Known RV planet proper-
ties draw from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Contrasts are com-
puted at the planets’ brightest phases.

7.2. New Instruments and Facilities

James Webb Space Telescope (2022) – Launched in De-
cember 2021, the cryogenic, IR-optimized JWST may sig-
niﬁcantly expand the diversity of imaged exoplanets and
will break new ground with exoplanet characterization.
The 6.5m JWST will have poorer resolution and perfor-
mance at the smallest angular separations than most leading
exoplanet-imaging platforms. However, JWST will have
unrivaled sensitivity in the thermal/mid IR (3–20 µm) com-
pared to ground-based instruments, which must contend
with bright sky emission: JWST can discover cold sub-
Jupiter mass planets at wide separations around the nearest
stars (Beichman et al. 2010; Carter et al. 2021). Thermal
IR IFS data will be free of telluric contamination.

Next-generation extreme AO on 6-10m telescopes (2022-
2026) – Over the next few years, upgraded systems should
improve planet-to-star contrasts by a factor of 10–100× at
small separations, reaching contrasts ﬂoors nearing 10−7,
and improving performance for optically fainter stars.
SCExAO on Subaru will undergo major hardware and soft-
ware upgrades, improving upon its current implementation
of advances such as predictive control incorporating ones

27

Currie, Biller, Lagrange et al.

Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of Extrasolar Planets

like real-time telemetry calibration, coherent modulation,
and photonics technology (Guyon et al. 2020; Currie et al.
2020a). MagAO-X (Males et al. 2020) will leverage recent
hardware and algorithm advances to push high contrast per-
formance in the optical. Upgrades to GPI and SPHERE
will likewise feature improved wavefront sensing capabili-
ties (e.g. Chilcote et al. 2020; Boccaletti et al. 2020).

Roman-CGI (2026) – The Coronagraphic Instrument on
the Roman Space Telescope will provide the ﬁrst test of
focal-plane wavefront control and advanced coronagraphy
in a space-borne environment (Spergel et al. 2013). CGI’s
benchmark performance is ∼10−7: comparable to the best
contrasts expected from ground-based extreme AO on 8-
10m telescopes in the next 5 years. However, laboratory
tests simulating a space environment suggest that CGI could
reach contrasts as deep as ∼10−9: sufﬁcient to image true
Jupiter analogues in reﬂected light (Shi et al. 2017; Spergel
et al. 2013). The potential success of CGI’s technolog-
ical demonstration may justify a follow-on science pro-
gram focused on detection and spectral characterization of
reﬂected-light gas giant planets.

Planet imaging with Extremely Large Telescopes (2030s)
– The large apertures and excellent sky conditions at the
sites of the upcoming European Extremely Large Telescope
(E-ELT; 39m; Cerro Armazones), Thirty Meter Telescope
(TMT; 30m; preferred site is Maunakea), and the Giant
Magellan Telescope (GMT; 24.5m; Las Campanas) make
exoplanet imaging with ELTs a critical science case. All
three telescopes have approved or planned high-contrast
imaging instruments covering the red optical to the mid-IR.
Mid-IR instruments – e.g. TMT/MICHI (Packham et al.
2018), E-ELT/METIS (Brandl et al. 2021) – use a single
high-order AO correction plus a coronagraph to achieve ex-
pected contrasts of ∼10−7 at 3–10 µm capable of imaging
warm Neptune or larger-sized planets around many nearby
stars and exo-Earths around a dozen or so solar-type stars
(Lopez-Morales et al. 2019). Those operating in the red op-
tical to near-IR – e.g. TMT/PSI (Jensen-Clem et al. 2021)
and E-ELT/PCS (Kasper et al. 2021) – beneﬁt from a sec-
ond AO correction in series to achieve expected contrasts
of ≤10−8, sufﬁcient to image rocky, habitable zone planets
around nearby M dwarfs.

Space-borne high-contrast imaging ﬂagship missions
(2040s+) – NASA is considering two potential exo-Earth
imaging instruments with apertures ranging between 4m
and 16m: HabEx and LUVOIR (Gaudi et al. 2020; The
LUVOIR Team 2019), and the recent NASA ASTRO2020
decadal review rated large-aperture, space-based planet-
imaging telescopes such as these as its highest priority for a
ﬂagship mission. Both designs will employ advanced wave-
front control and coronagraphy, building upon the experi-
ence of technical developments from Roman-CGI and the
ground and yielding 10−10 contrasts. Some designs would
ﬂy with a starshade capable of delivering even deeper con-
trasts and higher SNR detections of exo-Earths identiﬁed
from coronagraphy. The European Space Agency is con-
sidering a mission – LIFE – to detect and spectrally char-

acterize exo-Earths through high-contrast interferometry
(Quanz et al. 2021).

7.3. Future Science Focuses

The next 5 years: young giant exoplanet atmospheres
at λ > 5 µm with JWST – JWST will enable the ﬁrst ex-
ploration of directly imaged exoplanet atmospheres at λ >
5 µm. Especially past 10 µm, directly imaged exoplanet
as well as brown dwarf atmospheres are almost completely
unexplored; the only >10 µm spectra that exist for any sub-
stellar object are for a handful of L and T ﬁeld brown dwarfs
from the Spitzer cryogenic mission (Cushing et al. 2006).

The ∼10 µm spectral region is particularly diagnos-
tic of atmospheric properties. Silicate emission at 10 µm
may directly conﬁrm silicate clouds in these atmospheres
(Luna and Morley 2021), the existence of which has previ-
ously been inferred by modeling, but not directly detected.
Longer wavelengths may also better distinguish between
different theoretical models, see e.g. Skemer et al. (2012)
and Skemer et al. (2014a). JWST will also potentially de-
tect thermal emission from sub-Jupiter mass planets >30
au from their host stars and sub-Saturn mass planets >50
au from their host stars (Beichman et al. 2010; Carter et al.
2021).

The next 5 years: ground-based advances – Next-
generation extreme AO systems will achieve contrasts
capable of detecting young Jupiters and intermediate-
aged superjovian-mass planets at Jupiter-like separations.
Should contrasts at or slightly below 10−7 be reached,
these new instruments might be capable of providing the
ﬁrst images of planets in reﬂected light.

Direct

imaging detections of signiﬁcant numbers of
super-Earth or Earth mass planets will have to wait for
the advent of ELTs and new space telescopes. However,
imaging the known habitable zone planet Proxima Cen-
tauri b (Anglada-Escud´e et al. 2016) might be possible
with 8-m class telescopes and substantial dedicated ob-
serving time. For example, Lovis et al. (2017) propose
targeting this planet by combining VLT/SPHERE with the
ESPRESSO high resolution spectrograph. They estimate
that 20-40 nights of observations would yield a 5-σ detec-
tion of the planet and that 60 nights of observations would
yield a 3.6-σ detection of the biosignature gas O2.

The next 10 years: Imaging and characterizing mature
giant planets – With the advent of ELTs on the ground and
dedicated space-based missions such as CGI, direct imag-
ing of exoplanets will expand from detecting young plan-
ets via thermal emission in the infrared to detecting ma-
ture planets via reﬂected light in the optical. Indirect meth-
ods like astrometry and RV will provide a sample of solar-
system age giant planets which can then be imaged via their
reﬂected optical light using exoplanet imaging cameras on
ELTS such as PCS on the E-ELT (Kasper et al. 2021) and
PSI on the TMT (Guyon et al. 2018). For example, Fig-
ure 18 compares a predicted ELT planetﬁnder reﬂected light
contrast curve (Kasper et al. 2010) with a simulated popu-

lation of Gaia-detected giant planets from Perryman et al.
(2014) and known RV planets. Extreme AO planet-ﬁnding
cameras on ELTs will directly image and spectrally charac-
terize dozens of solar-system age giant planets.

These new facilities and instruments will also enable
deeper characterization of the current cohort of young, di-
rectly imaged exoplanets. In particular, these instruments
will incorporate high resolution spectroscopic capability
alongside extreme adaptive optics and state-of-the-art coro-
nagraphs (Kasper et al. 2021). This will enable high-
precision spectroscopic and rotational studies, including
the possibility of directly reconstructing top-of-atmosphere
(TOA) cloud structure for a handful of young giant exo-
planets (Snellen et al. 2014; Crossﬁeld 2014). A particu-
larly exciting future opportunity will be direct mapping of
giant planet atmospheric structure via the Doppler imaging
technique, which uses time-resolved, high-resolution spec-
troscopy (R>40000) to produce a high SNR composite line
proﬁle, then uses maximum entropy methods to reconstruct
TOA structure from that line proﬁle (Vogt et al. 1987). To
date, only one extremely bright brown dwarf, Luhman 16B,
has been Doppler-mapped (Crossﬁeld et al. 2014) and only
2-3 others are sufﬁciently bright for this technique with 8-m
class telescopes (Crossﬁeld 2014). Extremely large tele-
scopes will enable Doppler imaging of dozens of brown
dwarfs and a few directly imaged planets (Crossﬁeld 2014).
Imaging and characterizing exo-
Earth twins – ELTs will play an important role in imag-
ing and characterizing habitable zone rocky exoplanets
around a range of primary star masses.
Instruments like
E-ELT/PCS and TMT/PSI will image and spectrally charac-
terize a few dozen habitable zone exoplanets around M stars
in red optical to near-IR reﬂected light at wavelengths prob-
ing key biomarkers (e.g. O2 at 1.27 µm; Lopez-Morales
et al. 2019). Very deep mid-IR observations of nearby
solar-like stars can detect thermal emission bracketing the
∼10µm ozone feature in ∼10-15 systems (Figure 19, left

The next 20 years:

panel).

Using a combination of advanced wavefront control,
coronagraphy, and/or a starshade, space-based missions like
HabEx, LUVOIR, and LIFE should be capable of imag-
ing and spectrally characterizing exo-Earths around several
tens of Sun-like stars. The NASA missions will split their
exo-Earth ﬁnding science program into a shallow corona-
graphic search and a deep, focused follow-up of candidate
habitable zone planets conducted with coronagraphy (LU-
VOIR) and/or a starshade (HabEx). Survey designs are still
in development and strongly depend on the adopted value of
ηEarth – the frequency of Earth-like planets around Sunlike
stars. Currently, values for ηEarth are extrapolated from the
Kepler transiting planet mission (Dressing and Charbon-
neau 2015; Kopparapu et al. 2018), although these ηEarth
values describe only the frequency of small, rocky planets,
not necessarily habitable planets.

These missions will provide not just detections but spec-
tra to identify biosignatures gases (and hence life) in the
atmospheres of these planets (Figure 19, right panel). No
one biosignature gas by itself can clearly indicate the pres-
ence of life, as many biosignature gases, such as O2, can
have abiotic sources (Meadows et al. 2018). Thus, con-
ﬁrming the presence of life on a planet requires detecting a
combination of gases that do not appear together in equilib-
rium state – disequilibria in this case is driven by the pres-
ence of life (Meadows et al. 2018). To ensure coverage of
a wide range of biosignature gases, these missions will de-
liver spectra over a broad wavelength coverage: e.g. from
near-ultraviolet to near-IR for LUVOIR.

The study of exoplanets has yielded many surprising re-
sults, such as the existence of hot Jupiters, the ubiquity of
super-Earths, and the extremely red colors of young giant
exoplanets, thus, caution is merited both in our predictions
of what we may ﬁnd with future instruments as well as in
our interpretation of the data yielded by such instruments.
Considering this, it will likely require detections of key

29

biosignature gases in a statistically signiﬁcant sample of
Earth-like exoplanets to be ﬁrmly convinced that we have
truly detected life outside our own solar system.

The detection of habitable zone planets around Sun-like
stars through M stars through direct imaging will be nec-
essary to provide our ﬁrst steps towards truly providing
a context for our own Earth. M star planets encounter a
very different radiation environment than planets around
FGK stars and are predicted to be tidally locked, which
may pose signiﬁcant obstacles to true habitability (Shields
et al. 2019). To understand the frequency of life, it is then
key to detect and characterize both M star habitable zone
planets and planets more like our own – the only planet
we know to date to truly be inhabited. However, detection
and characterization of true exo-Earth twins (deﬁned here
as planets with similar mass as the Earth in the habitable
zone of Sunlike stars) pose a challenge for transit and RV
techniques.
If viewed as an exoplanet, the Earth would
only appear to transit once a year, thus requiring observa-
tions over many years or even decades to reach sufﬁcient
S/N in transit spectra to search for biosignatures. While the
sensitivity of current RV instruments such as ESPRESSO
and HARPS is sufﬁcient to detect the RV signal of an exo-
Earth twin around a Sunlike star, that signal will generally
be drowned out by noise from the stellar activity of the host
star (Haywood et al. 2020; Langellier et al. 2021). Thus,
while many M star habitable-zone exoplanets will be dis-
coved ﬁrst via transit or RV, then characterized with direct
imaging, direct imaging is more naturally suited for both
the discovery and characterization of true Earth twins.

This review thus concludes where it began, with the
prospects for identifying, conﬁrming, and characterizing a
true Earth twin around a nearby Sun-like star via direct
imaging. The ﬁrst direct images of exoplanets were pub-
lished less than 15 years ago. Since then, exoplanet di-
rect imaging has advanced rapidly, constraining the orbits,
masses, atmospheres, population demographics and forma-
tion mechanisms of young giant planets. We forecast the
rapid technical and scientiﬁc progress driven by the many
and varied exciting new telescopes and instruments coming
online in the next 20 years.

With these new capabilities, direct imaging and spec-
troscopy are highly likely to yield the ﬁrst detections of
true Earth twins and following that, the ﬁrst detection of
life outside the solar system – possibly the ﬁrst substantive
steps towards knowing whether or not we are alone in the
universe.
