Abstract

Context and aims: The Onsala twin telescopes (OTT) are two 13 m tele-
scopes located at the Onsala Space Observatory in Sweden. With dual lin-
ear polarized broad-band (3-14 GHz) receivers,
they are part of the next
generation Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Global Observing Sys-
tem (VGOS) for geodesy and astrometry. In addition to purely geodetic
data products, VGOS will regularly produce full-polarisation images of hun-
dreds of radio sources. These rich monitoring data will be valuable for
both astronomy and geodesy. In this pilot study we aim to monitor 10
bright radio sources to search for ﬂares or similar activity, and to verify
the instrument calibration on long (months) and short (hours) time scales.
Method: We observed and analysed 91 short (<30 min) sessions spanning
7 months. We monitored seven potentially variable radio sources (0059+581,
0552+398, 1144+402, 1156+295, 1617+229, 3C418, OJ287) and three refer-
ence calibrators (3C147, 3C286, 3C295). We used the Common Astronomy
Software Applications (CASA) package to fringe-ﬁt, bandpass-correct and
scale the data to obtain ﬂux densities in the four standard VGOS bands:
3.0-3.5 GHz (band 1), 5.2-5.7 GHz (band 2), 6.3-6.8 GHz (band 3), and
10.2-10.7 GHz (band 4). Results: We obtain simultaneous multi-frequency
light curves for ten radio sources. A bright multi-frequency ﬂare is observed
in the radio source 0059+581. OJ287 and 1156+295 show signiﬁcant long-
term variability. Conclusions: After correcting for instrumental biases, we
determine the empirical ﬂux density uncertainty as ∼5 %. Future reﬁned
analysis methods will allow regular monitoring of more and fainter sources.

1 Introduction

VGOS is an international collaboration to provide highly accurate terrestrial and
celestial reference frames, as well as highly accurate Earth orientation parameters
(EOP), i.e. polar motion, universal time and celestial pole oﬀsets. Several of the EOPs
can only be determined with geodetic VLBI and are essential for the operation of
all kind of satellite systems, including the widely used Global Navigation Satellite
Systems such as GPS and Galileo. Geodetic VLBI, and thus VGOS, is therefore cru-
cial for all kinds of positioning and navigation applications. For further details about
geodetic VLBI in general and VGOS in particular, we refer the reader to Sovers et al
(1998); Petrachenko et al (2012); Nothnagel et al (2017) and references therein.

VGOS aims to signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of geodetic data products,
compared to traditional legacy (S/X-band) observations. This means new technical
challenges and requirements, for example the need for continuous monitoring of
telescope system temperatures, often referred to as Tsys, during observations. Con-
tinuous Tsys monitoring is required to provide up-to-date ﬂux densities for optimal
scheduling of VLBI observations (Le Bail et al, 2021), and to account for source
structure eﬀects in geodetic analysis (Shabala et al, 2014; Xu et al, 2019).

The Onsala twin telescopes, ONSA13NE (Oe) and ONSA13SW (Ow), separated
by 75 m, are currently the only fully operational VGOS twin telescopes in the world
(Haas et al, 2019). They oﬀer a unique setup to verify and explore the new broad-
band VGOS capabilities in terms of hardware and software. In particular, the OTT are
since spring 2021 able to monitor Tsys during observations (Le Bail et al, 2021). This
capability does, however, need to be veriﬁed by commissioning observations. While
single-dish observations can oﬀer some guidance, proper veriﬁcation of the system
performance require interferometric observations, as would be the case in full VGOS
observing. This can be achieved by using the OTT as a single-baseline interferome-
ter, where the output data streams are correlated to form complex visibilities which
can then be appropriately calibrated to obtain ﬂux densities of celestial sources. By
comparing the results with known reference sources, the stability and accuracy of
the telescope observing systems can be assessed. If done successfully, we also obtain
(the ﬁrst) simultaneously measured light curves of sources in the four VGOS bands.
In this paper, we report on the results of commissioning observations carried out
with the OTT during 7 months in 2021. In Sect. 2 we describe the observations and
the methods used to analyse the data. The results are presented in Sect. 3 and are
discussed in Sect. 4. Finally, we present our conclusions in Sect. 5.

2 Observations and data analysis

We scheduled 102 short (< 30 min) experiments from May 2021 to December 2021
including between two and ten sources in each experiment. Two series of experiments

were scheduled: the Flux Monitoring (FM) sessions spanning 7 months, and the Intra-
Day Variability Monitoring (IDVM) sessions spanning 3 days. A list of all scheduled
observations is presented in Table 1. Due to limited observing time and/or correlator
time, not all sources were included in all observations. For cross-checking purposes,
at least one absolute ﬂux-density reference source was included in all experiments
starting with fm2110. Eleven of the scheduled experiments failed in diﬀerent ways,
as noted with comments in Table 1, and were excluded from our analysis. We note
that initially the campaign was planned for the period May to August, but a few
additional observations were made in December to verify the system performance
after maintenance work (see Sects. 2.3 and 2.4).

The OTT are equipped with DBBC3 backends (Tuccari et al, 2018), sampling
the analog waveform and producing VLBI Data Interchange Format (VDIF) packets
which we record on disk using jive5ab1. We use the standard VGOS observing setup
recording 8 Gbps per telescope. Each telescope recorded 32 intermediate frequencies
of 32 MHz width (see Table 2), both polarizations using 2-bit sampling.

Table 1: The 102 experiments scheduled in this work. The 11 failed experiments
were excluded from analysis.

2.1 Sample selection

We selected seven sources based on a their properties in existing literature. Starting
from the VGOS standard source catalog used in regular observations, we used the
Bordeaux VLBI Image Database (BVID)2 to identify sources with diﬀerent bright-
ness and variability, and the NRAO/VLA Sky Survey (NVSS)3 to identify sources

with signiﬁcant structure and/or other nearby companions. A summary of the proper-
ties for the selected sources are given in Table 3. We note that while the OTT baseline
length of 75 m in theory can achieve a maximum synthesised resolution of about 3
arc minutes at 5 GHz, the actual projected baseline length may often be signiﬁcantly
shorter. The corresponding maximum ﬁeld-of view for the 13 m single dish is about
20 arc minutes. Structure in Table 3 hence mean that we ﬁnd signiﬁcant structure on
scales of 3 arc minutes or larger in the respective NVSS ﬁeld image, and Isolated
means that we ﬁnd other bright sources within a 10 arc minute radius. We also note
that while NVSS is a good match for the OTT angular scales, it is a signiﬁcantly lower
frequency (1.4 GHz) than the VGOS bands. The structure of our selected sources
and nearby sources may hence diﬀer at the VGOS bands. Similarly, the BVID ﬂux
densities include 8.4 GHz (X-band) measurements which does not overlap directly
with the VGOS observing setup. Nevertheless, we selected the seven sources based
on these BVID and NVSS data as no corresponding VGOS-catalog exists.

2.2 Obtaining ﬂux densities from raw telescope data

We used DiFX 2.6 (Deller et al, 2007; Deller et al, 2011) to correlate the VDIF
data and obtain complex visibilities, which were exported to FITSIDI-format using
the DiFX tool difx2ﬁts. Since the antennas share the same clock, and normally use
a 5 MHz spaced pulse-calibration system for geodetic VLBI corrections, the pulse-
cal tones correlate and produce strong interference in the visibility spectra. To allow
sharp removal of these tones, and to account for any unknown signiﬁcant instru-
mental eﬀects, we correlated with high (0.1 MHz=320 channels per SPW) spectral
resolution, and 1 second time resolution. Astronomical VLBI telescopes often dis-
tribute Tsys measurements in antab format4. To make use of existing software, we
hence stored our Tsys measurements (and gain curve models) as antab ﬁles. The
antab information (Tsys+gain) was then appended to the FITSIDI using the CASA
VLBI Tools developed by JIVE5.

We developed a calibration script in python to process all our data using CASA
tools (McMullin et al, 2007). First, the data were imported to Measurement Set (MS)
format using the CASA task importﬁtsidi. We used accor to normalise the visibil-
ity amplitudes using auto-correlations, fringeﬁt to determine delay, rate and phase

corrections (with 30 sec solution interval, one solution per SPW per polarisation),
and bandpass to adjust for instrumental bandpass eﬀects (using 3C295 or, if miss-
ing, instead OJ287). In addition to removing the predictable pulse-cal tones, the task
rﬂag was used to mitigate other radio frequency interference (RFI), in particular in
the lowest band 1. For the interested reader, the full python script used for the CASA
processing (the same for all experiments) is available as online material attached to
this paper.

After processing, the data were averaged to obtain, for each source, one ﬂux
density value per SPW and polarisation. All values obtained for all experiments are
available as online material attached to this paper. An example is shown in Fig. 1.
While there is generally good agreement between the measured values and values
from the literature for the three ﬂux density calibrators, a few particular aspects
needed further attention.

Fig. 1: The measured full-polarisation spectrum, per spectral window, as obtained in
experiment fm2142 for the absolute ﬂux density reference source 3C295. The solid
line shows the model from Perley and Butler (2017). Some of the points in band 1
(3.0-3.5 GHz) are outside the scale of this plot, likely due to residual RFI. The non-
zero cross-polarisation amplitudes (HV and VH) in band 1 is also likely (at least
partially) due to RFI. A signiﬁcant oﬀset of the VV-ﬂux densities in band 2 (5.2-5.7
GHz) is clear, and was signiﬁcantly improved by repairing a faulty down-conversion
board (see Sect. 2.3).

2.3 Empirical scaling factors

From ﬁrst analysis it was clear that band 2 VV-polarisation amplitudes were consis-
tently lower than expected, see Fig. 1. This was eventually determined to be due to a
faulty down-conversion board in the Oe DBBC3. We therefore determined an empir-
ical correction factor for band 2 by comparing our data with the (Perley and Butler,

2017) models for 3C147, 3C286 and 3C295. After repairing the board, in Septem-
ber 2021, the VV-level (from fm2160) improved signiﬁcantly. The scaling factors
applied to our band 2-data were 1.4 before the repair, and 1.1 after the repair.

To account for other apparent systematics we also scaled, again from comparing
with the reference source models, band 3 by a factor 1.05 before fm2160 and band 4
by a factor 0.95 after fm2160.

These empirical scaling factors have been included in the ﬁgures presented in
this paper, but not in the machine readable tables of ﬂux density values available
electronically.

2.4 Noise diode power supply failures

In September 2021 the noise diode signals of both telescopes failed within a few
weeks of each other. First gradually, with unstable levels and non-linear on/oﬀ
behaviour, and then completely with no signal received. The problem was faulty
power supplies used for sending the on/oﬀ signal from the control building to the
telescopes, and nothing faulty with the actual noise sources themselves. Some experi-
ments which did not process as expected could perhaps have been aﬀected by the ﬁrst
gradually failing stage of these power supplies, these are noted as Low. amp in Table 1
and excluded from analysis. After replacing the power supplies with new units, the
noise reference level returned to its previously stable value. The last experiments,
from fm2163, all behaved as expected.

2.5 Removing outliers and forming Stokes I

Despite using rﬂag in our CASA processing to mitigate RFI, there are still (broader)
RFI signals aﬀecting some SPWs in our data. This is most severe in the lowest band 1,
but sometimes also aﬀect higher frequencies. Either directly in the data, or indirectly
via the Tsys measurements. We also suspect there may be minor residual instrumental
biases for some SPWs, which cause abnormally high or low values. To mitigate the
impact of these outliers, we employed two ﬁlter conditions when averaging the HH
and VV SPW ﬂux densities together to provide one Stokes I value per VGOS band.
Firstly, we excluded any SPWs where the cross-polarisation correlation amplitudes
(HV or VH) were higher than 15 % of either HH or VV values. The exception was
for 3C286, which is known to be linearly polarised at the 10 % level, where we
empirically (with good results) put the cutoﬀ at 30 % of HV or VH. Secondly, we
calculated the median of the SPWs in each band and excluded values deviating more
than a factor of 2 from the median value. This procedure turned out to provide robust
results, at the expense of losing some data - in particular in band 1. This was most
severe for the weakest source 1617+229 where no usable data were recovered for
band 1. However, we decided this loss is acceptable.

2.6 Estimating uncertainties

Based on the empirical scatter in our time series for the reference sources, see Fig. 2,
we adopt an empirical uncertainty of 5 % for all bands. With this, we obtain the
reduced χ2 values for our reference calibrator sources given in Table 4. For most

Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template

10

Broad band ﬂux-density monitoring of radio sources with the Onsala twin telescopes

bands, except 3C286 band 1 and 3C295 band 4 (which could potentially be explained
by excess emission from other ﬁeld sources), 5 % uncertainty appears too pessimistic.
However, the antenna gain curves are only known with 5-10 % uncertainties, and
hence residual direction-dependent gain errors could aﬀect our data. Detailed mod-
elling to account for these eﬀects is beyond the scope of this work. For simplicity, we
therefore adopt a 5 % uncertainty for all bands based on our reduced χ2 analysis.

3 Results

After processing the data using the methods and corrections described in Sect. 2, we
obtained one Stokes I ﬂux density value per source per experiment. These values
are shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4 for the FM-experiments, and in Fig. 5 for the IDVM
experiments. Machine-readable tables with all values used to make the ﬁgures are
available in the online material attached to this paper.

4 Discussion

In this section we discuss the limitations of this study, and compare our results with
other data from literature.

4.1 Known limitations in scheduling and analysis

In this work we were limited to short experiments, i.e. a limited number of sources,
due to limited processing (correlation) power. We used a single 10-core machine,
where each experiment took a few hours to process. This enabled one FM-session in
the afternoon, and correlation in the evening or following day, before the next session.
Some IDVM sessions, which were more closely spaced in time, only included 2
sources to decrease processing time. With more computing power available in the
future, we expect to be able to process, and hence also observe, more sources.

We formed Stokes I as the average of the parallell linear polarisation products,
i.e. (HH+VV)/2. This does not correct for neither parallactic angle diﬀerences, nor
instrumental leakage. In principle, this could be accounted for by using e.g. PolCon-
vert (Mart´ı-Vidal et al, 2016, 2021), but this is beyond the scope of this work. Instead
we note that since the telescopes are so close, the diﬀerential parallactic angle is
negligible. Furthermore, we empirically ﬁnd that (for most SPWs and sources), the
cross-polarisation products are negligible compared to HH and VV, implying that any
instrumental leakage is not signiﬁcant.

In this work we conservatively scheduled relatively long scans of 180 s for the
ﬂux density reference sources 3C286, 3C295, 3C147, 120 s for the weak 1617+229,
and 60 s for the remaining six sources. We ﬁnd, however, that fringes can be obtained

in 30 sec solution intervals for >1 Jy level sources in 32 MHz bandwidth. This means
we could signiﬁcantly shorten the scan length if combining multiple spectral win-
dows together in fringe-ﬁtting. This is routinely done in geodetic VGOS processing,
by correcting for instrumental phase- and delay oﬀsets for each SPW so they can
all be aligned for the broad-band fringe-ﬁtting. In principle, both instrumental SPW-
speciﬁc phase- and delay oﬀsets, and directional-dependent oﬀsets tracked using the
pulse-calibration system, could be incorporated in our analysis. However, these SPW-
speciﬁc corrections are challenging to apply in a in CASA, since there are not yet
standard tasks to include e.g. pulse-calibration data. Since the single-SPW ﬁtting
worked suﬃciently well to fulﬁl our aims, we did not pursue the issue of combining
multiple SPWs further.

Finally, our RFI-mitigation using rﬂag and ﬁltering SPWs as outliers could be
improved. Still, the strategy employed here appears to give robust results in all four
VGOS bands.

4.2 Notes on individual sources

We ﬁnd our sources to be a mix of both stable and variable in time, as well as a
range of spectral signatures. In this section we brieﬂy discuss our results for the seven
sources in relation to existing literature.

Broad band ﬂux-density monitoring of radio sources with the Onsala twin telescopes

4.2.1 0059+581
0059+581 has been used as a bright and compact fringe ﬁnder during VGOS com-
missioning work. It does however exhibit signiﬁcant ﬂux density variability on short
and long timescales, and has been included in multiple monitoring campaigns at radio
(Lister et al, 2018, 2021), gamma-ray (Paliya et al, 2021) and optical (Blinov et al,
2021) wavelengths. This source was the one most often included in our monitoring,
already from the start and our FM-results are shown in Fig. 3. We detect at least one
apparent ﬂare of emission, in all four bands, with the peak around MJD 59361. We
do not detect any signiﬁcant short-term variability in our IDMV sessions, presented
in Fig. 5c. We ﬁnd our data to be consistent with a ﬂat spectrum, where the tenta-
tive excess emission at the lowest band 1 could be due to other nearby synchrotron
sources in the ﬁeld.

4.2.2 OJ287

OJ287 may host a supermassive black hole binary system (Dey et al, 2021). It is
known to be variable and has been monitored at multiple wavelengths for over a cen-
tury (see e.g. Hudec et al 2013; Komossa et al 2020; Lister et al 2021 and references
therein). Our measurements are presented in Figs. 4e. We ﬁnd OJ287 to exhibit some
moderate variability during the ﬁrst months. However, the signiﬁcant increase in
power observed in our ﬁnal data points, taken in December 2021, suggest that it has
entered an active phase. Continued monitoring of this source at VGOS frequencies
could give valuable data for future multi-wavelengths studies.

4.2.3 1156+295

This source has also been included in monitoring campaigns, e.g. Lister et al (2019),
and studied with dedicated VLBI observations (Zhao et al, 2011). As evident from
Fig. 4c, the ﬂux density of 1156+295 increases by a factor 2 in a linear fashion during
the 7 months spanned by our monitoring. The four bands follow each other, keeping
the inverted (more power at higher frequencies) spectrum from start to end. We do
not detect signiﬁcant variability in our short IDVM sessions, see Fig. 5d.

4.2.4 1617+229
The blazar 1617+229 has also been included in monitoring campaigns (Lister et al,
2019; Richards et al, 2014). It is the weakest source in our sample, with a relatively
stable and ﬂat spectrum of about 0.5 Jy as can be seen in Fig. 4d. We note that after
the maintenance work (Sect. 2.3) it appears that we obtain robust estimates of the
ﬂux density also in band 2. Although our measurements are internally consistent,
and consistent with literature, the results - in particular for the lowest band 1 - could
be improved with reﬁned calibration procedures (e.g. combining multiple SPWs in
fringe-ﬁtting).

4.2.5 1144+402
1144+402 is identiﬁed as a ﬂat-spectrum radio source in the MOJAVE monitor-
ing campaign (Lister et al, 2021), in good agreement with our results presented in
Fig. 4b. We ﬁnd this source to be stable over our measurement period, with similar
ﬂux densities obtained in all four bands.

4.2.6 3C418

3C418 has signiﬁcant structure both on large (NVSS) and small (VLBI) scales and of
interest to astronomers for many years (e.g. Muxlow et al 1984). It has been observed
frequently in VGOS sessions, and it has been demonstrated that the structure sig-
niﬁcantly impacts geodetic data analysis (Xu et al, 2021). We ﬁnd this source to be
relatively stable, see Fig. 4f, with band 2, 3, 4 ﬂux densities of about 4 Jy. This is
consistent with e.g. the S/X-band monitoring from the BVID, which shows a slow
increase over time.

4.2.7 0552+398

This source has also been the subject of VLBI observations for many years (e.g.
Spangler et al 1983; Lister et al 2019). We ﬁnd it to be slowly varying with a ﬂat
spectrum in bands 1, 2 and 3. The multi-frequency lightcurve given in Fig. 4a is
consistent with the past monitoring data available via the BVID.

5 Conclusions

In this work, we have arrived at the following conclusions:

1. The electronics and calibration tables used to monitor system temperatures for
the Onsala twin telescopes are working as expected within the nominal 10 %
uncertainty.

2. With minor improvements to the model of antenna gain vs. elevation, and correc-
tions for backend systematics, ﬂux densities of ∼ 500 mJy-sources could in the
future be monitored to within a few % in the 3 to 15 GHz band.
3. We observed a bright multi-frequency ﬂare in the source 0059+581.
4. Once the full international VGOS network is capable of routinely monitoring
system temperatures during observations, the astronomical community may get
regular broad band ﬂux-density monitoring (and mapping) of hundreds of sources
”for free” during geodetic VLBI observations.
