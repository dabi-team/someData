ABSTRACT

Context. The Galactic Center (GC) region has been studied in gamma rays in the past decades - the GC excess detected
by Fermi is still not fully understood and the ﬁrst detection of a PeVatron by H.E.S.S. indicates the existence of sources
that can accelerate cosmic rays up to a PeV or higher.
Aims. In this paper, we are investigating the origin of the PeVatron emission detected by H.E.S.S. by, for the ﬁrst
time, simulating cosmic rays in the GC in a realistic three-dimensional gas and photon ﬁeld distribution and large-scale
magnetic ﬁeld.
Methods. We solve the 3D transport equation with an anisotropic diﬀusion tensor using the approach of stochastic
diﬀerential equations as implemented in the propagation software CRPropa 3.1 (Merten et al. 2017). We test ﬁve
diﬀerent source distributions for four diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the diﬀusion tensor, i.e. with ratios of the perpendicular
to parallel components (cid:15) = 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3.
Results. We ﬁnd that the two-dimensional distribution of gamma rays as measured by H.E.S.S. is best ﬁt by a model
that considers three cosmic-ray sources, i.e. a central source, the SNR G0.9+0.1 and the source HESS J1746-285. The
ﬁt indicates that propagation is dominated by parallel diﬀusion with (cid:15) = 0.001.
Conclusions. We ﬁnd that the 3D propagation in the 3D gas and B-ﬁeld conﬁgurations taken from Guenduez et al.
(2020) can explain the general features of the data well. We predict that CTA should be able to identify emission from
SgrB2 and the six dust ridge clouds that are included in our simulations and that should be detectable with a the
expected resolution of CTA of 0.033◦.

1. Introduction

The Galactic Center (GC) is one of the most interesting re-
gions for the investigation of non-thermal processes in the
Galaxy: The outﬂows as detected at gamma-ray (Michelson
et al. 2010; Su et al. 2010; Herold & Malyshev 2019; Ack-
ermann et al. 2014), microwave (Finkbeiner 2004; Dobler
2012) and radio wavelengths (Pedlar et al. 1989), are in need
of proper modeling of the mass distribution and magnetic
ﬁeld structure in the GC. At GeV energies, the gamma-
ray excess detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT)
on board of the Fermi satellite is in need of explanation
(Cholis et al. 2021; Di Mauro 2021; Pohl et al. 2022) to-
gether with the very ﬂat energy spectrum of ∼ E−
2.3 (Ack-
ermann et al. 2012) and at TeV-PeV energies, the the origin
of the PeVatron detected by H.E.S.S. needs to be under-
stood (Abramowski et al. 2016; Abdalla et al. 2018). This
detection indicates the existence of a PeV cosmic-ray source
in the GC, thus for the ﬁrst time providing a hint where in
the Galaxy particles can be accelerated up to the knee of
the cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum. In particular, Abramowski
et al. (2016) report a spatially broad diﬀuse gamma-ray

emission up to tens of TeV. Given that cosmic-ray interac-
tions with gas lead to the production of gamma rays that
receive approximately 10% of the original cosmic-ray en-
ergy, it is clear that the underlying cosmic-ray source must
have an energy spectrum that extends up to the so-called
cosmic-ray knee, i.e. up to PeV energies. With a simpliﬁed
approach of a one-dimensional diﬀusion modeling of the
radial proﬁle of the gamma rays and the gamma-ray spec-
trum, Abramowski et al. (2016) come to the conclusion that
there must be a central accelerator in the GC region with
a cosmic-ray luminosity of ∼ 1037 − 1038 erg/s. An update
of the analysis is presented in Abdalla et al. (2018), where
a detailed morphological study was performed. The lon-
gitudinal and latitudinal distributions of the emission are
presented and modeled with a many-component emission
and gas model. It is shown that the H.E.S.S. data are best
ﬁt by a central source that produces the central peak. In
addition, two point sources are identiﬁed in TeV gamma
rays, i.e. at the location of the Supernova Remnant (SNR)
G0.9+0.1 and at a location where a counterpart cannot be
identiﬁed at this point, labeled HESS J1745–290.

It is discussed in Abdalla et al. (2018) that - due to the
lack of a three-dimensional model of the ambient condi-
tions in the GC Region - a three-dimensional simulation
of the gamma-ray signatures was not possible so far. A
ﬁrst three-dimensional modeling of the local gas distribu-
tion and the magnetic ﬁeld in the Central Molecular Zone
(CMZ) was presented in Guenduez et al. (2020). In that
work, a magnetic ﬁeld component for the central 200 pc
has been derived from theoretical considerations based on
existing knowledge on the diﬀuse gas component, molecu-
lar clouds (MCs) and non-thermal ﬁlaments (NTFs) in the
CMZ. It could be shown that the general distribution of
gamma rays is much better represented in this ﬁeld conﬁg-
uration as compared to global magnetic ﬁeld models that
are typically used for propagation of cosmic rays through
the Galaxy.

In this paper, we use the results of Guenduez et al.
(2020) - in the following referred to as GBFD20 - in order to
perform diﬀusive 3D cosmic-ray propagation in the CMZ.
We include the three-dimensional gas distribution (diﬀuse
gas and MCs) for interactions with the gas and propagate
the particles using parallel and perpendicular diﬀusion in
the three-dimensional magnetic ﬁeld derived in Guenduez
et al. (2020). We further use the distribution of stars as the
source of a photon ﬁeld, relevant for gamma-gamma inter-
actions in the CMZ. Our propagation results are ﬁtted to
the H.E.S.S. data from Abdalla et al. (2018) and this way,
we can test diﬀerent hypotheses of the cosmic-ray source
distribution and diﬀerent models for the ratio of perpen-
dicular to parallel diﬀusion coeﬃcients.

This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we sum-
marize the ambient conditions that we use for the propaga-
tion of cosmic rays in the CMZ. We present the propagation
model in Section 3, while results are shown and discussed
in Section 4. Finally, a summary and outlook is given in
Section 5.

2. Three-dimensional modeling of the Galactic

Center Region

In order to model the three-dimensional transport and in-
teraction of cosmic rays in the GC region, we use the mass
distribution and magnetic ﬁeld model presented in Guen-
duez et al. (2020). In this section, the most important fea-
tures are summarized. In addition, we present a model for
the photon ﬁeld in the GC region, which is needed in order
to properly consider gamma-gamma interactions.

2.1. A model for the gas density in the GC

The total density proﬁle of the GC region is modeled to be
composed of three individual components:

1. local Molecular Clouds (MCs) - the properties of the
well-known clouds in the GC region are summarized in
Table 1 in Guenduez et al. (2020).

2. the gas structure of the innermost 10 pc of the GC re-
gion is taken into account as discussed in Ferrière (2012).
3. an analytical description of the intercloud medium is
given in Ferrière et al. (2007). As compared to that orig-
inal publication, the normalization factor is scaled down
in Guenduez et al. (2020), as the subtraction of the sub-
structures that are considered separately (see item (1)

Article number, page 2 of 18

and (2)) is necessary. This procedure results in the dif-
3 and
fuse densities for H2 and H as n0,H2 = 91.1 cm−
n0,H = 5.3 cm−
3. We use these numbers for the diﬀuse
gas component in this work as well.

2.2. A model for the three-dimensional large-scale magnetic

ﬁeld in the GC

The total magnetic ﬁeld is given by the superposition of
three B-ﬁeld components derived from

1. the diﬀuse Inter Cloud Medium (ICM), BICM
2. eight known non-thermal ﬁlament (NTF) structures,

BNTF,i with i = 1, . . . 8;

3. twelve local MC regions, BMC,j with j = 1, . . . 12.
The orientation of the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld compo-
nents in the ICM and the NTF regions is predominantly
poloidal. The ﬁeld is therefore modeled with an analyti-
cal, divergence-free and isotropic poloidal ﬁeld model that
is presented in Ferrière & Terral (2014) as model C. Nor-
malization, opening of the ﬁeld lines and lengths scales are
adapted individually for the eight NTFs and for the ICM
as described in Guenduez et al. (2020). An average value
of BICM ≈10 µG determines the ﬁeld strength in the ICM
(Ferrière 2009) and the typical parameters for the NTF re-
gions can be taken from Table 1 in Guenduez et al. (2020).
The MC regions, on the other hand, are typically ex-
pected to have a horizontal ﬁeld orientation. The ratio
η = Br/Bφ between the radial and azimuthal ﬁeld is set
to η = 0.5 as suggested in Guenduez et al. (2020). The
ﬁeld structure is then derived by using Euler’s α and β po-
tentials, which deliver a divergence-free expression of the
magnetic ﬁeld using B = ∇α × ∇β = (Br, Bφ, 0). The
magnetic ﬁeld strength in the MC region can be taken from
Table 1 in Guenduez et al. (2020).

The total ﬁeld in the CMZ is then obtained by a super-

position of the magnetic ﬁelds:

Figures 1 and 2 display the 3D conﬁguration and
strength of the total mass distribution and magnetic ﬁeld
in the CMZ, respectively. These conﬁgurations are used
in our simulations, using the gas distribution for model-
ing hadronic interactions and the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld
model for the three-dimensional propagation of the charged
particles.

2.3. A model for the background photon ﬁeld in the GC

The CMZ is home to more than 200 O-type stars (Kauﬀ-
mann 2017). These types of stars are rare and bright, and
their temperature exceeds 3·104 K. For instance, 4 of the
90 brightest stars that are visible to the eye from Earth
are O-type stars. They are prominent candidates for future
violent supernova explosions due to their high mass. Thus,
these types of stars represent energy reservoirs for CR accel-
eration in the CMZ. In total, three well-known star clusters
in the GC exist: ﬁrst the Central cluster, second the Quin-
tuplet cluster and third the Arches cluster. Accordingly,
the photon ﬁeld is enhanced from FIR to UV wavelengths.
Although in the CMZ the star and photon density is the

highest in the Milky Way, star formation is suppressed, in-
dicated by the lack of H2O and methanol masers in the
GC (Kauﬀmann 2017). Rathborne et al. (2014) show this
suppression applies to the entire CMZ.

The background photon density has been discussed to
play a crucial role for gamma-gamma interactions in Porter
et al. (2018). In addition, Inverse Compton scattering of
high-energy electrons of the photon ﬁeld can lead to the
production of high-energy photons. And ﬁnally, high-energy
photons undergo pair-production via their interaction with
the ambient low-energy photons. In order to include these
processes, this work makes use of a 3D photon distribu-
tion model as described below. Proton-gamma interactions
are negligible considering the spatial extent and the energy
range in the CMZ and are not included in this work.

Sophisticated three-dimensional models of the interstel-
lar radiation ﬁeld (ISRF) in the Galaxy are presented by
Freudenreich (1998) and Robitaille et al. (2012), both inves-
tigated in the context of cosmic-ray propagation in Porter
et al. (2017, 2018). While the model of Robitaille et al.
(2012) generally describes the global Galactic emission best,
it assumes local symmetry in the GC region. Freudenreich
(1998) on the other hand considers a spatially asymmet-
ric distribution of the photon ﬁeld in the GC. This is why
we apply the ISRF model developed in Freudenreich (1998)
in our work. In the description of Freudenreich (1998), the
spatial description of the energy density is given by the

The photon energy density as a function of the wavelength
is displayed in Figure 3 and the resulting integrated energy
spectrum as a function of spatial coordinates in Figure 4.
Using this model, Porter et al. (2018) investigate the in-
ﬂuence of gamma-ray attenuation due to electron-positron
pair generation in the GC. They assert an attenuation of
around 10 %, which would lead to an increase in the true
cut-oﬀ energy by a factor of 2.1 as compared to what is
measured with H.E.S.S. The authors assume an injection
of photons from a single centralized source, which neglects
the fact that the photons are more likely emitted diﬀusely
through the entire CMZ. As the propagation length through
the photon ﬁeld in the GC region becomes shorter if they
are produced with a certain distance from the center, it is
likely that the attenuation is rather lower than the expec-
tation presented in Porter et al. (2018). We will test the
inﬂuence of the photon distribution in this paper.

3. Simulation setup
For the propagation of cosmic rays in the GC region, we
use the CRPropa framework (Alves Batista et al. 2016).
While CRPropa was originally written for the propagation
of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from extragalactic sources,
it was extended by a solver of the transport equation in or-
der to be able to treat lower-energy cosmic-ray propagation

the ambient medium or ﬁeld. These terms thus do not need
to enter the transport equation and catastrophic as well as
continuous loss terms can be considered properly this way.
Due to the modular structure of CRPropa, multiple prop-
agation environments can be considered at the same time.
In particular, the following variables are set:

1. The numerical precision of the simulation is set to

vergence of the 4th and 5th order of the Runge-Kutta
algorithm that is used to solve the equations.

2. The minimum and maximum integration step length
values are related to the minimum and maximum dif-
fusion lengths in parallel direction – deﬁned by the up-
per/lower boundary of the wave vector spectrum in k-
space, lmin / max = 2π/kmax / min
, respectively: In order
to determine these, we use that in the SDE description,
the root mean square of the deplacement is given by the
Wiener process

with ν = 0, 1, 2, 3 and a summation over the index µ
according to the commonly used sum convention. The
term dωµ is described by a four-dimensional Wiener pro-
cess with Gaussian noise (see (Merten et al. 2017) for
details), dωµ = ηµ

parallel component, together with the resonance crite-

3. Pseudo-particles are injected into the system and prop-
agated and tracked according to their trajectory length.
A stationary solution in the module SDE is achieved
by simulating the discrete time-dependent solution and
ﬁnally integrating over time (Merten et al. 2017). A de-
tailed description of how to achieve the stationary from
the time-dependent solution can be found in Merten
et al. (2018). In our simulation set-up such a solution
is obtained for a maximum trajectory length of 5.1 kpc
(see Figure 5).

Within this work, the following changes and implementa-
tions have been considered, which have in parts been inte-
grated in the new CRPropa 3.2 version (Alves Batista et al.
2021):

in galactic magnetic ﬁelds (Merten et al. 2017). A still ex-
isting limitation toward low energies comes from the fact
that CRPropa is relativistically formulated, i.e. the pro-
gram makes use of the limit E = p · c for the energetics of
the particles and assumes that particle scattering of cosmic
rays with a gas target is happening in the full forward direc-
tion. For this work, this means that particles with a Lorentz
factor of γ (cid:28) 103 cannot be taken into account and we
therefore only consider cosmic-ray protons with Ep > 1 TeV
and cosmic-ray electrons with Ee (cid:29) MeV.

The transport equation implemented in CRPropa is
solved using the concept of Stochastic Diﬀerential Equa-
tions (SDEs) as described in detail in Merten et al. (2017).
The transport equation that is implemented in CRPropa
3.1 is time-dependent and includes a diﬀusion term with a
diﬀusion tensor ˆD and an advection term with a velocity
u,

Here, S(r, p, t) is the source term and n is the local cosmic-
ray diﬀerential intensity. The parametrization of the diﬀu-
sion tensor is done by neglecting drifts and thus assum-
ing a diagonal tensor in the frame of the local magnetic
ﬁeld line with a parallel and a perpendicular component
. Their relation is parametrized via the constant factor

. In this paper, we will investigate the depen-
(cid:15) := D
dence of the result on the exact choice of (cid:15), as it is not clear
from theory what the value should be. Diﬀusion is assumed
to be in the quasi-linear limit for a Kolmogorov type wave
vector spectrum, leading to D
∝ E1/3. In particular at
high turbulence level, there is evidence for a stronger en-
ergy dependence (Reichherzer et al. 2020, 2022), but as the
details about the turbulence level in the GC region are not
clear, we use the 1/3-dependence. As we ﬁt our results to
the H.E.S.S. energy spectrum, the only thing that would
change in our interpretation would be about the steepness
of the source(s) that would need to be adjusted.

Within the module DiﬀusionSDE in CRPropa, this
equation is solved by transforming the Fokker-Planck equa-
tion to a set of parabolic SDEs. The SDE can then be
treated numerically such that the next position of the
pseudo-particle is determined. This way, interaction pro-
cesses are considered at each step by calculating the prob-
ability for a speciﬁc interaction of the pseudo-particle with

1. A new CRPropa interaction module HadronicInterac-
tion (HI) integrates the generation of secondary elec-
trons, neutrinos and gamma rays into the simulation.
The interaction between CRs and the ambient medium
via hadronic-pion production is taken into account.
Here, the energy spectra of Kelner et al. (2006) and
diﬀerential cross section of Kafexhiu et al. (2014) have
been used.

2. In order to use the HI module adequately in the GC
region, the mass distribution discussed in Section 2 is
integrated into the framework of CRPropa and the in-
teraction module HI.

3. The framework construction of electromagnetic interac-
tions has been changed in order to consider customizable
photon ﬁelds with any behavior as a function of energy,
redshift, space, and time. Here, the space-time and red-
shift dependency are obtained by a separate scaling grid,
which is multiplied with the energy-dependent photon
density.

4. The photon ﬁeld energy density as a function of spatial
coordinates and energy, as described in Section 2.3, is
transcribed into the modiﬁed framework of CRPropa.
5. A minimum Lorentz factor γmin has been included into

the Boundary module.

We perform our simulations with the following ﬁnal param-
eter settings:

1. Each of the simulations is performed with 106 particles
on total, which follow a power-law distribution in the
energy range ∆E = 1 TeV − 1 PeV with a spectral
index of α = 2.0.

2. In our ﬁnal simulations presented in Section 4, we fur-
ther consider ﬁve source distribution scenarios presented
below. For each of the ﬁve simulations, we distribute the
particles correspondingly.

3. Simulations for four diﬀerent values of the ratio of the
perpendicular and parallel diﬀusion coeﬃcient (cid:15) are pro-
duced, i.e. (cid:15) = 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3.
The magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration is essential for the CR
propagation in the GC region, as presented in Section 2.
The GBFD20 model has also been integrated into the stan-
dard framework of CRPropa, see Alves Batista et al. (2021).
In the following subsection, we describe the exact set-
tings in the simulation. For a better overview, Table 1 sum-
marizes all modules and the related input parameters as
well as the outputs.

3.1. Boundary conditions and basic assumptions

The simulation in this work is constrained by the following
features:

1. The minimum Lorentz factor is ﬁxed to γmin = 1000
so that the injected protons approximately move at the
speed of light.

2. The simulation volume is restricted to a box of 200 ×
400×120 pc. All particles leaving the simulation volume
are lost.

3. The maximum trajectory length dmax of injected CRs
is related to the propagation time as Tmax = dmax/c.
A stationary solution is necessary in order to reproduce
the observed diﬀuse gamma-ray emission (Abdalla et al.
2018). It is therefore useful to consider the CR propaga-
tion time required to leave the region of interest. Figure

6 shows the diﬀerent timescales for the propagation. The
diﬀusion timescale (green, dashed line) at relativistic en-
ergies is given as τdiﬀ (cid:39) 3.3 · 1012 · (E/4 GeV)−
1/3 s for
traversing a region with radius R = 200 pc as done in
(Guenduez et al. 2018, 2019) and dominates the other
timescales of advection (orange, dotted line), adiabatic
losses (red, dot-dashed line) and hadronic interactions
(blue, solid line). The maximum trajectory length for
CR protons considering γmin = 1000, i.e. E (cid:39) 1 TeV,
yields

dmax = τdiﬀ · c = 5.1 kpc.
In fact, with these settings, almost all (more than 99 %)
of the CRs injected from a centralized source leave the
GC region. The amount of detected CRs after leaving
the region of interest as a function of the maximum
trajectory length is presented in Fig. 5.

4. The source distribution S is speciﬁed for the GC region

as discussed in Section 3.3.

Fig. 5. The percentage of detected CRs after leaving a region
of radius R = 200 pc from a central source as a function of the
maximum trajectory length is shown. In total, an injection of 106
particles within the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration of Guenduez
et al. (2020) is considered.

3.2. Optimization of lstep,min and lstep,max
In order to optimize the choice of the minimum step length,
test simulations are performed with 104 protons of 1 TeV
energy, using (cid:15) = 0. Figure 7 shows test particle trajecto-
ries for minimum step lengths of lmin/pc=0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0,
respectively, going from top to bottom. We use this interval
to be sensitive to the smallest structures in the simulation,
which are the smallest MCs, in the order of 0.1 − 1.7 pc.
The left panel shows the Y −Z distribution, i.e. the edge-on
view of the GC, whereas the right panel shows the X − Y
distribution, i.e. the face-on view of the GC. The particles
are injected directly into the GC and are propagated in the
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration presented in Guenduez et al.
(2020), with a detection taking place every 1 pc. As the
smallest MC is on the order of 0.1 pc, this is the smallest
minimum step size that we consider. As the distributions do
not show any signiﬁcant deviations, we use the large value
lstep,min = 1 pc in order to save computational time.

In order to determine a useful maximum step length, the
poloidal magnetic ﬁeld in the ICM region is considered as

3.3.1. The central source Sgr A∗
The center of our Galaxy Sgr A∗ is estimated to have a mass
of 4.3 · 106 M
. The supermassive black hole at the position
Sgr A∗ has recently been detected directly (Akiyama et al.
2022) and has a Schwarzschild radius of ∼ 1.3 · 1012 cm
(Gillessen et al. 2017). Sgr A∗ was ﬁrst discovered in the
radio survey by Piddington & Minnett (1951) as a discrete
and very luminous source. The radio emission of Sgr A∗
at > 1 GHz exhibits a power-law spectrum with a con-
stant spectral index of 1/3, indicating an optically thin
synchrotron emission. It was not until about decades later
that higher resolution instruments at λ = 3.5 mm exhib-
ited the elliptical shape of Sgr A∗ with a radius of less than
8(cid:1)◦ (Rogers et al. 1994; Krichbaum et al. 1998),
(cid:0)1/3 · 10−
which accordingly allows only an ultra-compact source, i.e.
a SMBH. However, the exceptionally low average rate of
mass accretion indicates that the SMBH is no longer active
today (Morris 2012). It is possible that part of the energy
of the SMBH is converted into the acceleration of cosmic
rays, which makes Sgr A∗ to one of the prime candidates
concerning the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.

3.3.2. SNRs and other point sources

From the gamma-ray measurements in the GC by H.E.S.S.,
three point sources have been identiﬁed (Abdalla et al.
2018):

1. HESS J1745-290 (central source)
2. G0.9+0.1 (SNR)
3. HESS J1746-28 (PSR)

It is discussed in (Abdalla et al. 2018) that the scenario of a
steady-state emission ﬁts the proﬁle better than a burst sce-
nario. The steady-state emission is what we investigate in

1 The pulsar (PSR) J1746-285 has already been detected in the
H.E.S.S. energy range (Abdalla et al. 2018) and is consistent
with emission from the pular-wind nebular (PWN) G0.13-0.11.

Fig. 6. The loss timescales are shown for hadronic interactions
(solid, blue line) as well as for diﬀusive (green, dashed line),
advective (orange, dotted line) and adiabatic (red, dot-dashed
line) losses. A region of R = 200 pc and an average gas density of
104 cm−3 is used. The following abbreviations are used for label-
ing: HI=hadronic interactions, Diﬀ=diﬀusion, Adv=advection
and Adb=adiabatic loss.

it shows the least curvature and thus allows for the largest
steps. While in these regions the magnetic ﬁeld is quite
uniform at a length of ∼ 200 pc, the requirement of at
least 25 steps before a particle leaves the simulation volume
provides better reliability. This reduces the step length to
8 pc and yields lstep,max = 5.0 pc. With the implementation
of the SDE Module in CRPropa3.1 (Merten et al. 2017)
the step size is chosen adaptive to ensure small interaction
probability in each step and keep the position error due to
the magnetic ﬁeld integration below 10−

4 per step.

3.3. Source distribution

Sources in the GC that have the potential to accelerate
particles up to knee energies or beyond are:

1. The central supermassive black hole Sgr A∗ located
at l = 359.94◦ and b = −0.046◦ (Ghez et al. 1998; Petrov
et al. 2011);

2. The SNR Sgr A East with its center at a distance of

2 pc from Sgr A∗ (Haardt et al. 2016);

3. The SNR G0.9+0.1 at a distance of ∼130 pc from Sgr

A∗ (Abdalla et al. 2018);

best ﬁt or not.

3.3.3. Pulsar population

Measurements at GeV energies give hints towards cosmic-
ray populations in the GC: An approximately spherically
symmetric gamma-ray excess with an extent of 20◦ from
the GC has been found by many groups using data from
the Fermi -LAT (for details, see Ackermann et al. (2017);
Di Mauro (2021) and references therein). For this purpose,
a variety of interstellar emission models and point source
catalogs have been studied. Interestingly, the spectral be-
havior of the excess resembles the expected behavior of PSR
emission in the bulge of the Galaxy. Thus, one expects that
the origin of the Galactic Center excess is based on unre-
solved PSRs. Motivated by this fact, this work makes use of
the PSR distribution of the inner Galaxy derived by Ajello
et al. (2017) and obtained by extracting PSR candidates
from Fermi -LAT data. Ajello et al. (2017) assume a spheri-
cally symmetric description and identify a spatial distribu-
tion following a radial proﬁle of dn/dr ∝ r−
α with α = 2.6
for the bulge, i.e. r < 3 kpc. Further, it has been argued
that 800 - 3600 PSRs are required to explain the Galactic
Center excess. As the distribution of pulsars is important
for GeV gamma rays, we will test their inﬂuence in our
simulations.

In order to include the pulsar distribution in our sim-
ulations, we use the following measures: We normalize the
distribution to 1 for the integrated distribution function
within 3 kpc. In doing so, the distribution of the source
density per radius is described as

dn

3 − α

As an input for the simulation, what is needed is the number
of pulsars for a given spatial coordinate. Thus, the function
N (r) needs to be inverted to ﬁnd the radius as a function of
the source density. The inverse function must ensure that
1(u)) = u at which u is some
N −
particular value of N (r) at a speciﬁc radius. In doing so,
the inverse function becomes

Assuming that the PSR distribution extends from the bulge
edge to the center, this range leads to u ∈ [0.000129, 0.016].
In order to obtain the position in Cartesian coordinates,
one must reduce the number of free parameters due to the
spherically symmetric description. Because the CMZ is ap-
proximately symmetrical to the x-axis, in the next step, the
unresolved PSRs are assumed to be located at the densest
gas position, i.e. x = 0. Then, the transformation from
spherical to Cartesian coordinates leads to

y = r · sin(θ) = N −

1(u) · sin(θ) and z = N −

1(u) · cos(θ) .

Fig. 8. The expected distribution of unresolved PSRs to explain
the Galactic Center excess is displayed.

(12)

The positions of PSRs are then obtained by drawing
a random number from a uniform distribution of u ∈
[0.000129, 0.016] and θ1 ∈ [−π, π]. Random numbers are
obtained by using the python library numpy (Van der Walt
et al. 2011). Once a position is obtained, the same proce-
dure can be repeated until the expected average number of
2200 PSRs is reached. This setting leads to the PSR distri-
bution within the CMZ region displayed in Figure 8.

3.3.4. Scenarios tested in this work

With the potential sources of cosmic rays in the GC region
discussed above, we test ﬁve diﬀerent source setups:

1. [Sgr A∗] A centralized source at the position of Sgr A∗,
also known as HESS J1745-290, is used as a sole source.
2. [3sr] Sgr A∗, G0.9+0.1 (SNR), and HESS J1746-285
(PSR) are considered as point sources as observed by
Abdalla et al. (2018). Here, we inject 72% of all parti-
cles into the central source HESS J1945-290, 22% in
G0.9+0.1 and 6% in J1746-285. These numbers are
based on the H.E.S.S. ﬁndings of the one-dimensional
modeling presented in Abdalla et al. (2018).

3. [3sr+uPSR] In addition to the second source setup,
this setting adds the PSR distribution that is discussed
in Section 3.3.3. In this scenario, we weight the pulsars
to contribute with 19 % to the total ﬂux, consistent with
the weighting factor necessary to explain the Galactic
Center excess at GeV gamma-ray energies presented in
(Ackermann et al. 2017).

4. [uPSR] The unresolved PSR distribution is assumed to

be the only source contribution.

5. [hom] As a test, a cylindrically symmetric and homo-
geneous source distribution, which includes all known
sources, MCs and star clusters is considered. The ho-
mogeneous distribution is limited to a cylinder with a
radius of −0.3◦ < b < 0.3◦ and a length of −0.5◦ <
l < 1.1◦. While this scenario is not motivated by any
underlying physics, it serves as a test and a comparison
to the other scenarios that are motivated as described
above.

Hereafter, the ﬁrst setup is referred to as [SgrA∗], second
[3sr], the third as [3sr+uPSR], the fourth as [uPSR],
and the ﬁfth as [hom]. All sources are visualized in Fig. 9.
Here, the blue frame represents the cylindrically symmetri-
cal source distribution, the red-edged and blue-ﬁlled circles
represent the PSRs, and the red-edged and orange ﬁlled cir-
cles represent HESS J1745-290, G0.9+0.1 and HESS J1746-
285, respectively. Furthermore, the opacity of the orange-
ﬁlled sources is proportional to the source strength.

target medium with a gas density of 102 cm−

and 104 cm−

3 (HI − 2).

3.4. Tested particle population and energy range

In this simulation, for simplicity, we use protons as the pri-
mary cosmic-ray component. We neglect the contribution
from the elements of helium and higher mass numbers at
this point, as the error is expected to be rather small, as
in the energy range of interest, the ﬂux is dominated by
protons, see e.g. Becker Tjus & Merten (2020) for a review.
The minimum energy is set to the lower threshold en-
ergy that applies to CRPropa, which is written for ultra-
relativistic particles in the limit E ∼ p · c only. For protons,
this results in a minimum energy of Emin = 1 TeV. This
means that the secondary photon ﬂux that can be consid-
ered must have a lower limit in energy > 100 GeV. We
therefore restrict the interpretation of our results to the
H.E.S.S. data and refrain from comparing to Fermi -LAT
data at this point.

The maximum energy is assumed to correspond to the
maximum expected Galactic CR energy of 1 PeV, i.e. the
energy at the knee. The spectral index is taken from the re-
sults of the theory of stochastic acceleration in shock vicini-
ties and therefore set to α = 2.0 for the simulations. As the
SDE method allows for the reweighting of the results, this
spectral index can be varied in the analysis in order to ﬁnd
the best ﬁt.

3.5. Interactions

The GC is enhanced in gas density and bright in back-
ground photons over a wide range of wavelengths. This
abundance of background gas and photons induces diﬀer-
ent processes, i.e. hadronic interactions, electromagnetic
pair production and inverse Compton scattering. These pro-
cesses are taken into account in the numerical simulation
approach. The related modules in CRPropa are called HI
(hadronic interactions), EMPairProduction, EMPP (elec-
tromagnetic pair production), and EMInverseCompton-
Scattering, EMIC (electromagnetic inverse Compton scat-
tering). The module HI requires an input function con-
cerning the gas density distribution. EMPairProduction
and EMInverseComptonScattering have equivalent input
parameters that require the photon density as a function
of the wavelength and a scaling-grid obtained from the
spatial distribution of the photon ﬁeld. In addition to the
GC background photon ﬁeld presented in Section 2.3 (from
now on called GCB), CMB and Cosmic Radio Background

Fig. 10. The optical depth is presented as a function of the
energy and for diﬀerent interaction processes: diﬀusion (yellow,
thick solid line), Inverse Compton in blue for the CRB (dot-
ted), GCB (short dot-dashed) and CMB (long dot-dashed), pair-
production in red for the CRB (short dashed), GCB (thin solid)
and CMB (long dashed) as well as hadronic interactions in green
with target densities of 102 cm−3 and 103 cm−3 (short and long
dot-dot-dashed), respectively. Here, a region with a radius of
200 pc is considered and λ denotes the mean free path, which is
correlated with the loss timescale.

3.6. Observer and Output
The CRPropa module Observer allows to customize the
output ﬁle. Here, the user is able to construct an observer
surface that detects particles only when they cross the sur-
face. The surface may have a paraxial or a spherical shape.
However, because this work is focused on secondaries, the
output is not restricted to an observer sphere. All secondary
particles are recorded immediately after their generation
and remain an active part of the simulation.

This work takes the following information of the parti-
cles, subsequently referred to as Candidates, into account:
current position, current energy, current direction of mo-
tion, trajectory length, serial number, particle type, and
particle type of the parent particle, position of their source,
and the generation process. Because the generation process
is tagged, the gamma-ray attenuation can be considered
by subtracting all gamma rays, which scatter into electron-
positron pairs via the module EMPP.

4. Results
In this section, we present our ﬁnal simulations with the
settings as discussed in Section 3. We compare the results

with the H.E.S.S. data presented in Abdalla et al. (2018).
The gamma-ray measurements by H.E.S.S. pass through
many internal conditions and ﬁlters, such as the eﬀective
area, which is in general sensitive to energy. In this par-
ticular case, however, the considered observed data are not
expected to change with respect to the energy dependence
of the eﬀective area, since the position of the GC in the
sky relative to the H.E.S.S. telescopes is approximately
at the zenith. Therefore, the observation of the GC can
be achieved under the best conditions with a low energy
threshold and without any signiﬁcant change in the eﬀec-
tive area through the entire CMZ (Benbow 2005). We there-
fore do not have to correct for any eﬀects concerning the
detection eﬃciency of H.E.S.S.

4.1. Spatial gamma-ray count proﬁles

In Abdalla et al. (2018), the gamma-ray count proﬁles are
given as the number of photons detected in a certain longi-
tudinal or latitudinal interval. In this section, we produce
count maps from our simulation data: The longitudinal pro-
ﬁles are integrated over the latitudes from −0.3◦ to −0.3◦
and the latitudinal proﬁles over the longitudes from −0.5◦
to 0.5◦. Because the ratio of perpendicular to parallel dif-
fusion (cid:15) has a signiﬁcant impact on the latitudinal and lon-
gitudinal proﬁle, this parameter can be ﬁxed by comparing
simulations of diﬀerent (cid:15) values with the count maps as
measured by Abdalla et al. (2018). In order to reproduce
the measurements, the simulation results must further be
smeared to the H.E.S.S. angular resolution of 0.077◦
2. For
this purpose, the results from the simulations are treated
with 2D-Gaussian smoothing with a sigma corresponding
to a radius of 0.077◦. Furthermore, the simulated data are
normalized to the amplitude value at the center of the lon-
gitudinal proﬁle. The signiﬁcance of the detection is the
largest at the center, so that the background noise can be
neglected. We use the same binning as H.E.S.S. for our
simulation data. The simulated latitudinal and longitudi-
nal count maps for ﬁve diﬀerent source distributions and
four diﬀerent (cid:15) values in each plot are presented in Figure
11.

The uppermost panels show the latitudinal (left) and
longitudinal (right) proﬁles that are expected for the [Sgr
A∗] model, the second row shows the model [3sr], the third
one [3sr+uPSR], the fourth [uPSR] and the lowest panel
[hom]. In each plot, the simulation results are shown for
four diﬀerent (cid:15) values, i.e. (cid:15) = 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3. In each
plot, the H.E.S.S. data are shown as ﬁlled squares.

For all source distributions, (cid:15) = 0.01 and (cid:15) = 0.001 ﬁt
slightly better to the observations as compared to the re-
sults obtained from (cid:15) = 0.1 and (cid:15) = 0.3 and thus, a low
inﬂuence of perpendicular diﬀusion is expected. More im-
portantly, it can be seen that the source distribution has a
signiﬁcant impact on the latitudinal and longitudinal pro-
ﬁles. It appears that only the source distributions [Sgr A∗]
and [3sr] deliver a good description of the data for both
the latitudinal and longitudinal proﬁles. Our results show
that the [3sr] scenario provides the best ﬁt. Adding the
pulsar distribution does not change the result for the lon-

gitudinal proﬁle signiﬁcantly3, but the latitudinal proﬁle is
enhanced such that the prediction overshoots the data sig-
niﬁcantly in particular for positive Z values. The reduced
source distribution with only the central source, [Sgr A∗],
narrows down the longitudinal proﬁle instead. For the ho-
mogeneous distribution of sources, the latitudinal proﬁle is
largely overestimated and the longitudinal proﬁle does not
ﬁt well, in particular for positive values of Y . It is interest-
ing to note that the three-dimensional propagation model
comes to the same conclusion as the one-dimensional ap-
proximation used in Abramowski et al. (2016), i.e. that a
three source scenario is the best ﬁt for the data.

Thus, for the energy spectrum and the count maps that
we present, we restrict ourselves to show the results for the
[3sr] scenario.

For the interpretation of the longitudinal emission pro-
ﬁle, it can be summarized that the complex and asymmetric
structure, with a number of smaller peaks around the cen-
tral one, is diﬃcult and none of the models ﬁt all peaks
simultaneously. The ﬁrst peak is related to the high gas
density at the center and all models can reproduce it rel-
atively well. The second observed peak location, however,
is shifted with respect to the peak predicted in this work.
While the peak in our simulations is caused by the dense
gas of the dust ridge clouds, the observed peak rather co-
incides with the location of Sgr B2. These ﬁndings indicate
that the gas density taken from Goldsmith et al. (1990) and
used in our simulations is not compact enough. If the mass
that is connected to Sgr B2 is distributed onto a smaller
volume with a higher density, the second peak at the loca-
tion of Sgr B2 could be enhanced. For clariﬁcation, further
observations by instruments such as CTA will provide sig-
niﬁcantly better spatial resolution and cover a broader en-
ergy range. Improvements on the gas density measurements
will also help to better quantify the ﬂuxes.

The peak at Y ∼ 60 pc in all source setups is due to the
compact MCs dust ridges A - F. Their compactness seems
to be suﬃcient and reasonable for the source setups that
provide the best ﬁt, i.e. [Sgr A∗] and [3s]. The enhanced
emission at Y ∼ −100 pc to Y ∼ −30 pc is not reproduced
by this model.

For the future, for a reliable identiﬁcation of a full source
setup, the detailed knowledge on the MCs is crucial. The
observed third peak is not seen in the simulation results
because no relevant sources or MCs are located between
l ∼ −40 pc and l ∼ −80. The MC Sgr C at ∼ 82 pc has
a radius of approximately 1.7 pc and alone would not be
suﬃcient to explain the third peak. Thus, in the given vicin-
ity, additional MCs or unresolved active sources could be
present. Alternatively, the size of Sgr C and thus the mass
could be underestimated in the observational results. For a
convenient comparison, Tables 2 and 3 list the resulting chi-
square tests adapting the null hypothesis that the observed
data are described by the simulation.

To summarize, a more realistic gas distribution is nec-
essary in order to explain all of the features seen in the
gamma-ray data. The H.E.S.S. collaboration has developed
an empirical model for the gas distribution, see Abdalla
et al. (2018) and references therein, based on the gamma-
ray distribution. This, however implies the knowledge of
the source distribution. As both cannot easily be disentan-

spectral index. The simplistic assumption by Abramowski
et al. (2016), i.e. α = αγ − 0.1, requires a proton spectral
index of ∼ 2.4, which is slightly steeper than what we ﬁnd.

Diﬀerent leptonic and hadronic processes can contribute
to the gamma-ray energy spectrum as discussed above. Re-
cently, Porter et al. (2018) predict a signiﬁcant attenua-
tion of high-energy photons due to their interaction with
the ambient photon ﬁeld. In their calculation, they assume
gamma-ray emission from one centralized source. By con-
trast, this work considers the entire CMZ, and the results
of this chapter can be used to test the previous prediction.
Moreover, this work takes into account gamma-ray produc-
tion via inverse Compton scattering by secondary electrons.
Figure 14 displays the total diﬀerential photon ﬂux
from the best-ﬁt simulation ((cid:15) = 0.001 with source index
α = 2.3) as well as the contribution from proton-proton
interactions (HI, circle) and from electromagnetic inverse
Compton (EM IC, pentagon).

The ﬁgure shows that the dominant contribution above
100 GeV photon energy indeed comes from the hadronic
interaction channel. Inverse Compton (IC) scattering has a
relatively high contribution at ∼ 100 GeV yet due to the
steepness of the spectrum, the relative contribution of IC
decreases rapidly with energy. It is possible that primary
electrons still have an impact on the photon spectrum until
TeV energies near the center of the Galaxy, but this ques-
tion is not investigated in this paper, as we do not propagate
the electrons here.

Figure 14 even shows the fraction of the originally
produced photon ﬂux that is attenuated through gamma-
gamma interaction (EMPP, triangle up).

The attenuation reduces the ﬂux by 1% to 10% and oc-
curs mainly at energies below ∼ 7 TeV. This attenuation
is signiﬁcantly lower compared to the results presented in
Porter et al. (2018). A reason could be that the photons in
our simulations are produced in a relatively broad region
in the CMZ, while Porter et al. (2018) assume a single cen-
tral source. Thus, the photons in our simulations traverse
a smaller column than in Porter et al. (2018), which leads
to a smaller attenuation eﬀect.

We also perform a ﬁt to both photon, neutrino and elec-
tron data from the simulation. We ﬁt the following function

simulation data point. A discussion of the cutoﬀ in the data
can be found in Abramowski et al. (2016). We refrain from
discussing this point in detail as we consider the data not to
deliver signiﬁcant information about a cutoﬀ at this point.
With CTA data, this will change in the future.

gled from each other, increasing the knowledge on the gas
distribution itself would be of high importance.

4.2. The energy spectrum

The energy spectrum of the CMZ as measured by H.E.S.S.
is of particular interest, as it is the ﬁrst to extend to almost
100 TeV photon energy. For a hadronic interpretation, that
implies the existence of cosmic rays with ∼ PeV energies or
higher, thus providing the ﬁrst measurement of a possible
PeVatron in the Galaxy.

The simulation data that we present in the following are
integrated over the so-called Pacman region, which corre-
sponds to a ring-like, symmetric region of a radius of 0.45◦
around Sgr A∗, where the inner 0.15◦ and a section of 66◦
are excluded (Abramowski et al. 2016). A schematic view
of the Pacman region together with seven more regions of
detection that form the basis of the spatially resolved signal
presented in Abramowski et al. (2016) and Abdalla et al.
(2018) are shown in Fig. 12 .

In the simulation, we inject a cosmic-ray energy spec-
2 and we reweight this spectrum to diﬀerent
trum Q ∝ E−
energy behaviors Q ∝ E−
α with α ∈[2.0, 2.05, ..., 2.4]. The
energy interval binning is adjusted to match H.E.S.S. data
presented in Abramowski et al. (2016). The normalization
factor is determined by assuming that the sum of the data
bins equals the sum of simulated data bins, i.e. the sur-
face below the data points is the same. The photon energy
spectra resulting from the simulations performed here are
shown in the four panels of Fig. 13 - the uppermost panels
are for (cid:15) = 0.001 (left) and (cid:15) = 0.01 (right) and the lower
ones for (cid:15) = 0.1 (left) and (cid:15) = 0.3 (right). In each panel, the
result is shown for ﬁve diﬀerent spectral indices, i.e. α = 2.0
(circle), α = 2.1 (pentagon), α = 2.2 (triangle up), α = 2.3
(triangle down) and α = 2.4 (diamond). The H.E.S.S. data
are shown as well (red squares). The best ﬁt to the data is
achieved for the combination (cid:15) = 0.001 and α = 2.3, where
we base the goodness of the ﬁt on chi-square tests under
the null hypothesis that the observed data are described
by the simulation. The results of this test are presented
in Table 4. An increase of (cid:15) seems to decrease the best-ﬁt

4.2.1. Luminosity proﬁle

In the next step, the simulation results are used for the cal-
culation of the gamma-ray luminosity, which we calculate
as

fore exist in the outermost data points at the spatial bins
III and VII. Such an eﬀect could be an indication for a con-
tribution of the diﬀuse cosmic-ray ﬂux from sources outside
of the GC, something that could be interesting to consider
in the future.

4.3. Gamma-ray count maps

Here, we use Emin = 1012 eV and Emax = 1015 eV as
the boundaries consistent with the H.E.S.S. observational
range.

The resulting gamma-ray luminosity as a function of
the distance from the point of origin is presented in Fig.
15. The luminosity detected by H.E.S.S. from speciﬁc ex-
tended regions, as described in Figure 12, is presented by
blue-ﬁlled, red-edged squares in Fig.15. The roman num-
bers written next to the data points correspond to the la-
beling of measured areas in Fig. 12, also displayed in small
in the top-left corner of Fig. 15. The colored crosses rep-
resent our simulation results for the same spatial regions
as the H.E.S.S. measurements. The diﬀerent lines repre-
sent the continuous luminosity progressions for (cid:15) = 0.001
(dashed line), (cid:15) = 0.01 (solid line), (cid:15) = 0.1 (dotted line)
and (cid:15) = 0.3 (dash-dotted line), which are integrated over
|b| < 0.3◦ and smeared to the H.E.S.S. angular resolution
of 0.077◦. The diﬀerent gamma-ray luminosities have been
normalized using the same normalization factor as found
for the diﬀerential gamma-ray ﬂux shown in Section 4.2.

In the ﬁgure, it can be seen that the central peak can be
reproduced well. This result is in contrast to the analytical
solution of the problem using a spherically symmetric den-
sity presented in Guenduez et al. (2018), where the peak
was diﬃcult to reproduce. Comparing the results for diﬀer-
ent values of (cid:15), the smaller values 0.01 and 0.001 describe
the data best. In general, the central part is well repro-
duced, but the mismatch between simulation and data in-
creases toward the outer parts of the CMZ. The largest dis-
crepancy between our model and observational data there-

Figure 16 shows the count maps of the photons that are
produced in the GC via the interaction of the 106 induced
cosmic-ray protons with the ambient medium for (cid:15) = 0.01
(upper panel) and (cid:15) = 0.001 (lower panel). We ﬁnd that the
center emission is very concentrated and declines strongly
toward high Galactic latitudes, basically disappearing at
values of |b| > 0.2. The decline toward larger Galactic lon-
gitudes is slower; the signal extends up to l ∼ 1.0◦ and
disappears at l < −0.5◦ at negative latitudes.

In order to properly compare the simulated spatial
structure of the gamma-ray map to the emission observed
by H.E.S.S., Fig. 17 shows our results using Gaussian
smoothing that corresponds to the H.E.S.S. angular resolu-
tion of 0.077◦. The ﬁgure also shows the > 4.5 σ and > 7.5 σ
signiﬁcance levels for the H.E.S.S. detection as orange and
red lines, respectively. For comparison, the predicted lines
of equal gamma-ray counts are added in black. While we do
not make a prediction of the normalization itself, it can be
seen that the shape of the observed distribution is matched
well by the simulation data.

The region with the highest signiﬁcance of detection,
enclosed by the red line, in general shows quite good agree-
ment with our simulation data. Even in this representa-
tion, the simulation with (cid:15) = 0.001 ﬁts slightly better than
(cid:15) = 0.01 or larger epsilon values. As this is consistent with
the ﬁndings in the previous subsections, we show the fol-
lowing plots for (cid:15) = 0.001 only. The discrepancy is more
signiﬁcant for positive longitudes, consistent with what we
found in the results shown in Fig. 11. One reason for this
could be existing Molecular Clouds that are not considered

in this work due to the lack of data. The existence of such
additional MCs has been discussed by Oka et al. (2001), but
it remains diﬃcult to detect a full sample at this point. In
particular, the cataloged masses show inconsistencies with
other observations, see e.g. Kauﬀmann et al. (2017); Fer-
rière et al. (2007); Goldsmith et al. (1990), which might be
due to an overestimation obtained from the usage of virial
masses that rather represent an upper limit than an exact
measurement. Neglecting the Galactic background diﬀuse
large-scale contribution, as described by Abramowski et al.
(2014), can also partially explain the discrepancy.

Figure 18 shows the gamma-ray map with a smearing
of 0.03◦ which corresponds to the approximate resolution
of CTA south for > TeV energies (Acharya et al. 2013). At
such a high resolution, the structure of the gas can be iden-

tiﬁed well. Beyond the central source, there are two speciﬁc
localized regions that show up at the CTA resolution which
are less pronounced for the H.E.S.S. data: at a longitude of
b ∼ 0.5, the six dust ridge clouds (A-F) are illuminated. At
a longitude of b ∼ −0.5, the cloud Sgr C shows up. It can
be expected that CTA will discover even more molecular
clouds, as the analysis of the comparison of our simulation
data with the H.E.S.S. results in previous subsections indi-
cates that there is still some signiﬁcant amount of MC gas
that could exist, but is not identiﬁed at this point.

4.4. Neutrino count maps and energy spectrum

The count map of co-produced neutrinos via proton-proton
interactions is presented in Fig. 19. The map shows all neu-
trino ﬂavors, but considering neutrino oscillations from the
ratio at a production of (νe : νµ : ντ ) = (1 : 2 : 0). With
neutrino oscillations, the ratio is (νe; νµ : ντ ) = (1 : 1 : 1)
so that without considering the normalization, the picture
shown does represent the ﬂux of each neutrino ﬂavor indi-
vidually. This is important, since the best pointing for neu-
trinos is received for charged current interactions of muon
neutrinos in the Antartic Ice instrumented by the IceCube
Neutrino Observatory.

While the count map is quite similar to the gamma-
ray one, it is not exactly the same. There are two reasons
for this: ﬁrst of all, Inverse Compton processes contribute
to the gamma-ray map. For the hadronic part, neutrino-
and gamma-ray maps should basically be close-to identical
at production. Afterwards, gamma rays are absorbed by
gamma-gamma interactions, which changes the count map
with respect to the one at production. These two eﬀects
alter the gamma-ray map with respect to the neutrino one.
A smeared version with an angular resolution of 0.1◦ is
shown in Fig. 20. This resolution corresponds to the one of
IceCube for through-going tracks at ∼ 2 TeV (Aartsen et al.
2017). Considering only kinematic eﬀects, this resolution
is already obtained at 0.1 TeV, and the resolution is in
general increasing with increasing energy, as a result of the
enhanced forward scattering at higher energies (Learned &
Mannheim 2000; Becker 2008).

Fig. 18. CTA count map (smoothing of 0.03◦) using (cid:15) = 0.001.

As can be seen from Fig. 19, it will be diﬃcult to see sub-
structures, even if the number of detected neutrinos would
be enough to have a spatial resolution. So, IceCube right
now will have diﬃculties in resolving these structure, with
future observatories and detections at ∼ 100 TeV−− PeV,
the resolution becomes better and the substructures might
emerge, if the event rates are large enough (see further dis-
cussion below).

The neutrino energy spectrum is calculated in the same
way as the gamma-ray energy spectrum (see Section 4.2). In
Fig. 21, the simulated energy spectrum of muon neutrinos
and anti-muon neutrinos is shown, derived from the ﬂux
of all neutrinos by considering neutrino oscillations from a
ﬂavor ratio at production of (νe : νµ : ντ )|source = (1 : 2 : 0)

Main

As for the gamma-ray spectrum, the cutoﬀ-energy is
not an eﬀect of a cutoﬀ in the simulation, but it is located
at energies that are higher than the simulated, signiﬁcant
data points. It is basically a lower-limit for a cutoﬀ in the
spectrum.

An IceCube 90 % C.L. upper ﬂux limit for the position of
= −29.01◦) = −48.5) is given in Aartsen
Sgr A∗ (sin(δSgrA
et al. (2020b) for a spectral index of α =2.0 (dashed, grey
line in Fig. 21). The lower energy threshold of the analysis is
relatively high, as the GC region is located at a declination
quite far above the horizon at the South Pole, i.e. δ = −30◦.
This implies that there is a large background of atmospheric
muons, which is reduced by applying the high-energy cut. A
diﬀerent method is to only consider events that start inside
of the detector. This approach was ﬁrst developed for high
energies ("high energy starting events", HESE) and lead
to the ﬁrst detection of the diﬀuse neutrino ﬂux (Aartsen
et al. 2013). The extension of this method to lower energies
followed shortly after (Aartsen et al. 2015) and provides
another channel of detection of the Galactic Center region.
The expected neutrino ﬂux from the Galactic Center
emission can be converted into a number of neutrinos to be
detected in diﬀerent analyses with IceCube based on the
eﬀective areas. Here we consider only the muon-neutrinos
and their eﬀective area, as the direction uncertainty for the
other ﬂavors is to large. For the HESE sample it is published
for the declination bands [0◦; −30◦] and [−30◦; −90◦] con-
cerning the point source search (Aartsen et al. 2020a). As
the Galactic Center lies at the boundary of these two dec-
lination bands δ ∼ −29◦, we use these two eﬀective areas
to calculate the rate of neutrinos according to

Nν = ∆tobs

(cid:90) dN
dEν

Aeﬀ (E) dEν ,

(15)

with ∆tobs as the observation time. Based on this estimate,
we provide the range of neutrinos. We receive a total num-
ber of neutrinos between 2 · 10−
4 − 0.08 for the full 10 years.
For the Medium Energy Starting Events (MESE) eﬀective
area, published in Aartsen et al. (2015) as supplemental
material, we use the zenith angle bin −0.2 ≤ cos(θ) ≤ 0,
where θ = 90◦ − δ is the zenith angle. Assuming an obser-
vation time of 10 years we receive ∼ 0.03 events4. Thus,
the sources in the Galactic Center itself are not observable
with IceCube at this point.. It should be noted that we do
not include the diﬀuse sea of background cosmic rays that
propagate into the Galactic Center from outer regions of
the Galaxy, so our numbers are rather considered to be a
lower limit.

KM3NeT will have a better detection potential due
to its location at the opposite side of Earth compared
to IceCube. The sensitivity corresponding to the median

(Aiello et al. 2019). Considering the extended source anal-
ysis of KM3NeT by Ambrogi et al. (2018), the minimum
detectable ﬂux is reached at ∼ 60 TeV. For lower energies,
the ﬂux limit increases rapidly. For energies > 60 TeV, the
median angular resolution improves from ∼ 0.13◦ up to

νµ+νµ = 0.297 eV cm−

0.07◦ at 105 TeV. Because the angular resolution is smaller
than the extent of the Pacman region, the upper limit an-
alyzed for the point source Sgr A∗ can be extrapolated to
a more extended region by considering the median angular
resolution following

(16)

Here, ∆δPacman denotes the extent of the region of inter-
est in degrees and δMA(E) the median angular resolution
as a function of the energy. The median angular resolution
and KM3NeT using 6 years of data and of IceCube using 7
years of data is presented in Adrián-Martínez et al. (2016)
and Aartsen et al. (2017), respectively. Figure 21 shows the
90 % C.L. upper-ﬂux limit of IceCube and the correspond-
ing sensitivity of KM3NeT. The limit calculation follows
Ambrogi et al. (2018), who calculate the sensitivites to ex-
tended sources, where the Pacman region has an extension
of ∼ 0.5◦.

5. Summary and Conclusions

In this paper, we apply a 3D propagation model with
anisotropic diﬀusion in the Galactic Center region, for
the ﬁrst time using a realistic representation of the three-
dimensional gas distribution and large-scale magnetic ﬁeld
in this region of the Galaxy. We perform our simulations
within the diﬀusion module of the CRPropa framework, us-
ing a new implementation of a generalized parametrization
of the photon ﬁelds, this way being able to include interac-
tions of the high-energy gamma-rays with the photon ﬁeld
coming from the populations of stars in the Galctic Center
region. We consider Inverse Compton scattering and syn-
chrotron radiation for the secondary electrons and most im-
portantly, proton-proton interactions for the hadronic pro-
duction of gamma rays and neutrinos. In doing so, we test
ﬁve diﬀerent source distributions for four diﬀerent ratios
of perpendicular to parallel diﬀusion. We normalize and
compare our results to the spatial distribution and energy
spectrum of the H.E.S.S. detection. We draw the following
conclusions

1. The broad distribution of the H.E.S.S. signal is well-
represented by a three-source model, including a cen-
tral source like Sgr A∗ a source at the position of SNR
G0.9+0.1 and HESS J1746-285. Other source scenarios
that we test neither match the two-dimensional distri-
bution nor the one-dimensional projections in longitude
and latitude as good. In particular, the distribution of
pulsars in the GC does not provide a good match to the
data, neither does the sole consideration of Sgr A∗.
2. The best results are achieved for small perpendicular
diﬀusion values, i.e. for a ratio of perpendicular to par-
allel diﬀusion of (cid:15) = 0.001.

3. Some small-scale features cannot be reproduced with
the model, which points towards the existence of molec-
ular clouds that are not well identiﬁed in the data yet
and, thus, not part of the three-dimensional mass dis-
tribution used.

4. At the same time, the general features are explained well
by the source and target distribution, including clouds
like Sgr B2 and the six dust ridge clouds (A-F). While
the latter contribute to the diﬀuse picture in the cur-
rent measurements, they can be detected as individual
gamma-ray emitting regions in the future with the bet-
ter spatial resolution of CTA.

5. We predict the distribution of neutrinos and note that
the resolution of IceCube is not enough to resolve the
individual features at this point, together with the fact
that the rate of neutrinos is simply too small. For future
observatories like KM3NeT and IceCube-Gen2, a detec-
tion can be possible, depending on how low in energy
threshold the observatories will reach and to what en-
ergies particles are accelerated. CTA, with its expected
sensitivity at ∼ 100 TeV photon energy, will be able to
provide further insights to the exact ﬂux at the highest
energies.
