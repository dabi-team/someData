Real-time monitoring of the gastrointestinal tract in a safe and comfortable manner is valuable for the diagnosis and therapy of
many diseases. Within this realm, our review captures the trends in ingestible capsule systems with a focus on hardware and
software technologies used for capsule endoscopy and remote patient monitoring. We introduce the structure and functions of
the gastrointestinal tract, and the FDA guidelines for ingestible wireless telemetric medical devices. We survey the advanced
features incorporated in ingestible capsule systems, such as microrobotics, closed-loop feedback, physiological sensing, nerve
stimulation, sampling and delivery, panoramic imaging with adaptive frame rates, and rapid reading software. Examples of
experimental and commercialized capsule systems are presented with descriptions of their sensors, devices, and circuits for
gastrointestinal health monitoring. We also show the recent research in biocompatible materials and batteries, edible
electronics, and alternative energy sources for ingestible capsule systems. The results from clinical studies are discussed for the
assessment of key performance indicators related to the safety and eﬀectiveness of ingestible capsule procedures. Lastly, the
present challenges and outlook are summarized with respect to the risks to health, clinical testing and approval process, and
technology adoption by patients and clinicians.

1. Introduction

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is both an intriguing and elu-
sive environment for diagnostic procedures and therapeutic
interventions. Its broad repository of electrolytes, metabo-
lites, enzymes, and microbes serves as potential targets for
several diseases and disorders [1, 2]. In this regard, real-
time monitoring of gastrointestinal biomarkers in a safe,
unobtrusive, and cost-eﬀective manner seems achievable in
the near future—in part because of the concerted growth,
commercialization, and adoption of video capsule endoscopy
and ingestible electronics [2–4].

A recent survey indicates that the ingestible capsule mar-
ket is expected to be worth $8.98 billion by 2024 with key
application areas in capsule endoscopy, remote patient mon-
itoring, and targeted drug delivery [5]. Other drivers for the

ingestible capsule market are the patient preference for min-
imally invasive procedures, favorable medical reimburse-
ment policies, and the rising rate of stomach and colon
cancers [5]. Modern ingestible capsules can navigate the gas-
trointestinal tract and inspect the spatial and temporal land-
marks pertinent to common gastrointestinal disorders. To
enable the diagnostic and therapeutic functions, a number
of advanced features are embedded in modern ingestible
capsules, such as microrobotics, targeted stimulation and
neuromodulation, controlled sampling and delivery, ﬁne
needle biopsy, closed-loop control, panoramic imaging,
and rapid reading algorithms [6–9]. The assessment of cap-
sule functions is done using key performance indicators
(KPIs) of accuracy and resolution, repeatability and robust-
ness, autonomous navigation, power consumption, form
factor, and operational ease. Besides these KPIs, a central

Figure 1: Scope of the review. This work surveys the hardware and software technologies for video capsule endoscopy and ingestible
electronics. We discuss the sensing parameters, electronics, imaging and reading software, challenges, risks to health, and performance
measures. The image of the human gastrointestinal tract is reproduced (adapted) from Selber-Hnatiw S. et al. Human gut microbiota:

objective of capsule technologies lies in improving the safety
and quality of procedures while prioritizing patient comfort
and involvement [10]. However, capsule system manufac-
turers face multiple hurdles as they move up the technology
readiness levels (TRLs). Some challenges arise from the fact
that human clinical trials are demanding, time-consuming,
and expensive and often compounded by the issues of inter-
patient variability, disease complexities, and nonoptimal
procedural parameters [11]. As such, our work is motivated
by the competing tradeoﬀs within the ﬁeld of ingestible cap-
sules—the exuberance of research breakthroughs balanced
by the rigors of clinical testing, approval process, and busi-
ness sustainability [12–14].

Here, our purpose is to provide a comprehensive review
of video capsule endoscopy and ingestible electronics with a
focus on recent developments in hardware and software
technologies (Figure 1). Section 1 introduces the structure,
functioning, and disorders of the mammalian gastrointesti-
nal tract. The time evolution of ingestible capsules and the
guidelines for their safety and eﬀectiveness are covered. Sec-
tion 2 explains the capsule components for gastrointestinal
sensing, imaging, and wireless telemetry with examples of
ingestible sensors, devices, and circuits. Section 3 demon-
strates the techniques for capsule navigation and localization
in the gastrointestinal
tract using magnetic actuation,
robotic manipulators, and electrical stimulation, in addition
to capsule placement devices. Section 4 illustrates the cap-
sules to monitor the physiological status,
including core
body temperature, pH and gastroesophageal reﬂux, and
intestinal gases. Section 5 shows the capsules to induce
mechanical vibrations and bioelectric neuromodulation in
the gut. Section 6 deliberates the capsules to track medica-
tion adherence, especially during self-administration of
drugs at home. Section 7 presents experimental capsules
for gut sample collection, bacterial biomarker detection,
and microbiome analysis. Section 8 gives examples of video

capsule endoscopes and rapid reading software, X-ray imag-
ing and microultrasound capsules, and imaging-guided ther-
apeutics and gastrointestinal surgical procedures. Section 9
highlights the trends in biocompatible materials, edible elec-
tronics, batteries, and alternative energy sources for the
next-generation ingestible capsules. Section 10 discusses
the present challenges and outlook for this ﬁeld.

1.1. Mammalian Gastrointestinal Tract. The structure and
functions of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract are depen-
dent on the body and size of the organism, nature and fre-
quency of
food storage, and
adaptation needs [15]. The human gastrointestinal tract is
approximately 8 m long and comprises the oral cavity,
esophagus, stomach, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum,
and ileum), and large intestine (cecum, colon, and rectum).
Table 1 lists the anatomic units of the human gastrointesti-
nal tract with its respective dimensions, pH, maximum
stress, disorders, and diagnostic procedures [8, 16–19]. It is
noteworthy that the anatomy of the human gastrointestinal
tract varies from person to person, and the physical dimen-
sions of the anatomic units vary signiﬁcantly with age, sex,
gender, ethnicity, etc. The esophagus (pH = 5‐6) has an
approximate length of 18-25cm, diameter of 2.5 cm, and is
accessible by endoscopy [16]. The stomach has an approxi-
mate length of 20 cm, diameter of 15 cm, and volume capac-
ity of 1-1.6 liters. The stomach is very acidic (pH = 1:2‐3:5)
where the supply of hydrogen ions is provided by the secre-
tions from parietal cells. The small intestine has an approx-
imate length of 6.25 meters, diameter of 2.5 cm, and a curvy
and convoluted shape. The acidic content of the stomach is
neutralized in the duodenum (pH = 4:6‐6:0) by alkaline ﬂuid
secretions (rich in bicarbonate ions) from the pancreas stim-
ulated by secretin and primary bile acids produced from
cholesterol in the liver. The small intestine is adapted for
nutrient absorption by having a large surface area with villi

which project into the luminal cavity. The eﬀective surface
area per unit villus surface is roughly around 25 μm2 [15].
The large intestine is approximately 1.5 m long with a diam-
eter of 6.5 cm and is involved in the recovery of water and
electrolytes, formation and storage of feces, and fermenta-
tion of indigestible food matter by bacteria. The ileocaecal
valve controls the passage of feces from the distal small
intestine (ileum) into the colon. The colon is home to the
largest number of bacterial microbes that produce a number
of beneﬁcial metabolites including short chain fatty acids to
maintain intestinal health [20, 21].

Compared with the human alimentary tract, the gastro-
intestinal tracts of common laboratory animals have certain
similarities and diﬀerences in their physiological, biochemi-
cal, and metabolic signatures [15, 22]. For instance, cyclic
gastric motility is exhibited in both humans and common
laboratory animals where stomach contractions aid in the
mixing and grinding of stomach contents for entry into the
duodenum. Humans and dogs have similar gastric morpho-
logic features (i.e., glandular structure lined with cardiac,
gastric, and pyloric mucosa), emptying characteristics, and
a similar gut microbiome [23]. The dog is also an excellent
model for investigation of gastrointestinal diseases [24].
Despite many anatomical diﬀerence of alimentary system
between humans and pigs [25], pigs are considered a better
model for translational research of human gastrointestinal
tract regarding function, nutrition, and digestive diseases
than many other laboratory models, particularly rodents
[26–28]. Besides the fact that pigs are an omnivore like
humans, the microbiota proﬁle of the pig gut shows consid-
erable similarity to that of humans at the phylum level. Pigs
also represent a useful in vivo model for investigation of
transplanted human fecal microbiomes under certain condi-
tions [29]. Furthermore, the pig gut is immunologically sim-
ilar to that in humans since it contains both Peyer’s patches
and lymphocytes that participate in mucosal immunity. The
predominant microbiota of humans and common labora-
tory animals typically contains E. coli, Streptococci, Lactoba-
cilli, Clostridium perfringens, yeasts, and bacteroides [15, 30].
The upper gastrointestinal tract in humans and rabbit is
similar and contains members of the Bacteroidetes and Biﬁ-
dobacterium spp. (a probiotic microbe that is low to nonex-
istent in the porcine gut). Pigs are susceptible to many
enteric pathogens aﬀecting humans [28, 29]. Understanding
the subtle microbiome distinctions can help choose the cor-
rect animal model for studies on absorption, bioavailability,
nutrition, food transit, and gut-brain nexus within humans
[15, 17, 31, 32].

The complex structure and functioning of the gastroin-
testinal tract lend itself to a multitude of gastrointestinal dis-
orders [17, 18, 33–35]. Esophageal disorders (such as
gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (GERD), infection, corrosion
or rupture of veins, and motility disorders) lead to sore
throat, diﬃculties in swallowing, and regurgitation. Investi-
gation of the esophagus is performed using barium swallows,
gastroscopy, endoscopy, and mucosal biopsy. Stomach dis-
orders (such as inﬂammation caused by infection such as
Helicobacter pylori, gastric ulceration, and peptic ulcers)
result in indigestion, vomiting, malnutrition, or vomiting

blood in chronic cases. Small intestine disorders (such as
inﬂammation, peptic ulcers, malabsorption, and tumors)
cause diarrhea, malnutrition, lethargy, and/or weight loss.
Investigation of the small intestine is conducted by blood
tests, diagnostic imaging with and without contrast, and
small intestinal endoscopy. Large intestinal disorders (such
as inﬂammation, functional colonic diseases, and colonic
infections by enteropathogens) may cause bloody stool, con-
stipation, fever, and/or abdominal pain. Investigation of the
large intestine is carried out using diagnostic imaging, colo-
noscopy, and capsule endoscopy. Rectal disorders (such as
inﬂammation, hemorrhoids, and anal cancer) result in anal
pain while defecating, fresh blood in the stool, and constipa-
tion. Investigation of the rectum is performed through regu-
tests, rectal examination, and proctoscopy.

Disorders of the liver, pancreas, gall bladder, and biliary tract
(e.g., gallstones, inﬂammation, and cancer) adversely inﬂu-
ence the secretion of digestive enzymes and gastrointestinal
functions and are examined by laboratory tests to measure
the levels of enzyme activities and speciﬁc organ function.

1.2. Time Evolution of
Ingestible Wireless Telemetric
Capsules. Historically, the basic concepts of endoscopy and
its relevance in medical diagnostics were known to us for
more than a century [36]. Rigid-wire endoscopy dates back
to 1852 but was limited to the upper gastrointestinal tract.
As summarized by Dr. Paul Swain (renowned gastroenterol-
ogist at the Royal London Hospital, London, U.K.), the
potential beneﬁts of imaging diﬀerent sections of the gastro-
intestinal tract (via wireless capsule endoscopy) were recog-
nized in parallel with the need for detecting its biophysical
and biochemical signatures (via ingestible electronics) [37].
In 1954, Harold Hopkins invented the ﬁbrescope (i.e., an
optical unit composed of ﬂexible ﬁberoptic bundles) to send
optical images of the gut. This led to the invention of a fully
ﬂexible, digestive endoscope by Basil Hirschowitz in 1957. A
collection of photographs of these pioneers and the endo-
scopic equipment from that particular era is nicely illus-
trated in a recent review article [10]. The same decade
witnessed the invention of the ﬁrst wireless, swallowable
capsule (called the radio pill) to measure pH, core body tem-
perature, and pressure of the gastrointestinal tract. In 1981,
the ﬁrst wireless video capsule was developed to capture
images of the gastrointestinal tract wall, even though imag-
ing technologies were rudimentary. Heidelberg Medical
Inc. (Germany) developed a pH capsule to diagnose abnor-
mal hydrochloric acid production in the stomach. Its teth-
ered capsule (15.4 mm long by 7.1 mm wide) consisted of a
radio frequency (RF) transmitter with an electrode and had
a 6-hour lifetime. In 1997, capsule endoscopy was conducted
for the ﬁrst time on live and deceased pigs using capsule pro-
totypes equipped with a light source, camera, video process-
ing unit, battery, and transmitter [38].

By the early 2000s,

low-power CMOS image sensors
paved the way for incorporating video capture functions
[37]. There were signiﬁcant

discoveries related to prolonged motility monitoring, continuous thermometrics, wireless capsule endoscopy, microrobotics, magnetic

light optics, and adaptive signal processing [1, 8, 39]. One of
the ﬁrst specialized imaging capsules was the M2A (i.e.,
mouth-to-anus) and PillCam SB capsules developed by
Given Imaging (Israel). The next-generation PillCam SB 2
capsule had wider-angle lenses, autoexposure feature, and a
longer battery life. The esophagus-speciﬁc (PillCam ESo)
and colon-speciﬁc (PillCam Colon) capsules were released
with higher frame rates. Simultaneously, companies such
as Olympus (in Japan), IntroMedic (South Korea), and Jin-
shan (China) developed their novel capsule endoscopy tech-
nologies. In 2003, the SmartPill became the ﬁrst FDA-
approved wireless capsule technology that integrated sensors
for measuring pH, core body temperature, and pressure.

Since 2004, there has been pioneering work in control-
ling the navigation and localization of capsule endoscopes
within the gastrointestinal tract by employing magnetic
ﬁelds, microrobotics, and self-stabilization techniques. Edi-
ble and bioresorbable electronics were explored to reinvent
the capsule circuitry and other system components. In the
past decade, new frontiers in gastrointestinal diagnostics
and therapy have been explored, such as real-time gas-sens-
ing, X-ray and ultrasound imaging, vibrating capsules, med-
ical adherence, microbiome studies, digital
therapeutics,
digiceuticals, and artiﬁcial intelligence. A timeline of the
abovementioned ingestible capsule technologies is depicted
in Figure 2. From the clinical perspective, emphasis started
to be placed on improving the quality and safety of endo-
scopic service with a patient-centered approach [40]. As
such, specialized nursing groups were created within gastro-
enterology and endoscopy societies to improve the safety
and comfort of patients, monitor the purchase and mainte-
nance of endoscopic equipment, and provide support during
patient hospitalization, recovery, and discharge [10].

shows that the device is substantially equivalent to a product
already in legal commercial distribution within the United
States. The FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance provides
directions on how to collect clinical information on various
topics, such as the ease of capsule ingestion, intestinal transit
time, diagnostic yield, any adverse events, and agreement
amongst reviewers on the interpretation of images [41].

The FDA has identiﬁed six risks to health from this
“generic gastroenterology and renal device”: (i) biocompati-
bility, (ii) electrical and mechanical safety, (iii) intestinal
obstruction or injury, (iv) functional reliability, (v) misinter-
pretation of recorded images, and (vi) RF-radiated power
and electromagnetic compatibility [41]. The FDA guidance
indicates that the testing on mechanical and structural integ-
rity can be related to the battery life, ﬁeld of view, depth of
focus, and device exposure to pH levels and mechanical
forces that are typically experienced during clinical studies

examples of items to be included in patient labelling are die-
tary restrictions, limitations on physical activity, safety fea-
tures, use limits, possible symptoms (e.g., nausea, pain or
vomiting), warnings, precautions, contraindications, and
electromagnetic interference [41]. Lastly, in order to facili-
tate smooth licensing and approval, the FDA mentions that
it considers the least burdensome approach for device man-
ufacturers to comply with its guidance and address the iden-
tiﬁed issues [41].

sensors to detect physiological signals and capture images,
ASIC chips to amplify and digitize sensors’ output, and wire-
less telemetry to communicate the recorded data to an exter-
nal receiver for data analytics and predictive diagnostics.

2.1. Ingestible Physiological Sensors, ASIC Chips, Optics, and
Batteries. The physiological sensors and ASIC chips for
ingestible electronics are generally fabricated in the standard
silicon CMOS or CCD technology. For capsule video endos-
copy, CMOS image sensors have faster readouts, smaller
pixel size, and less power consumption, but suﬀer from noise
susceptibility. On the other hand, CCD image sensors pro-
duce images of high quality and low-noise, but are inher-
ently power hungry. Various sensors and ASIC chips can
also be purchased directly from semiconductor manufac-
turers and distributors of commercial electronics and ASIC
chips (e.g., Mouser, Arrow Electronics, Digi-Key Electronics,
Future Electronics, Avnet, Rutronik, and Newark Electron-
ics). Image compression techniques, such as compressed
sensing (CS), are employed to dramatically improve the eﬃ-
ciency of image reconstruction from sparse signals using
fewer samples than that required by the Nyquist-Shannon
theorem [43]. A polymeric coating covers and protects the
electronic and optical devices. Typically, button silver-
oxide batteries provide the power, each having an output
of 1.55 V and 20 mW. The silver-oxide battery has a silver(I)
oxide cathode, zinc anode, and an electrolyte (sodium
hydroxide or potassium hydroxide). The silver(I) ions are

reduced to silver at the cathode, while zinc is oxidized to
zinc(II) at the anode. The outer encapsulation material is
chosen to make the capsule incompressible, nondisintegr-
able, and nondegradable during its transit through the gas-
trointestinal tract. Next-generation ingestible capsules are
harnessing new materials from nature to redesign various
components such as coatings, substrates, semiconductors,
conductors, dielectrics, and batteries (Table 2).

2.2. Wireless Telemetry, Transmission Frequency Bands, and
RF Transmitters. The design of wireless telemetry for ingest-
ible electronics is dependent on various parameters such as
transmission frequency, frame rate, data rate, pixel resolu-
tion, speciﬁc absorption rate (SAR) limit, and power con-
table of RF band
sumption [44]. A comprehensive
allocations within Australia and the United States was
recently published [45]. The ISM radio frequency bands
are reserved for industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical (ISM) pur-
poses (433.05-434.79 MHz for Europe and 902-928 MHz for
the U.S.) [46]. While the optimum transmission frequency
from an ingestible capsule in the human body is 600-
800 MHz, transmitting signals at lower frequencies (e.g.,
32 MHz) requires smaller real estate, reduced power con-
sumption, and longer battery life [46]. The common RF
communication protocols suitable for ingestible capsules
are Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee, and WiFi [45].
Other protocols, such as UWB, ANT, Thread, LoRa MICS,
IrDA, RFID, and NFC, also have potential use within this

Advanced Devices & Instrumentation

ﬁeld. WiFi is designed to wirelessly connect consumer elec-
tronic devices (e.g., phones and laptops) to the network
and hence requires large amount of power [45]. Zigbee and
LoRa are better suited for embedded systems with low power
consumption but have relatively smaller range [45]. BLE
implemented with Bluetooth 5.0 appears to be best suited
for low power transceivers and consumer applications with
a midpower consumption [45].

After choosing a suitable transmission frequency, the
design and test of the RF transmitter is a critical aspect of
wireless telemetry. The RF transmitter consumes a signiﬁ-
cant portion of the power to overcome the signal attenuation
from human body tissues, which can be greater than 23.4 to
24.4 dB (based on estimates of a 916.5 MHz electromagnetic
source located within 15 cm of human tissue) [47]. As a ref-
erence, the dielectric parameters of the human gastrointesti-
nal tract are as follows: relative permittivity εr = 67:2 and
conductivity σ = 1:01 S · m−1 [48]. To study the electromag-
netic radiation from RF transmitters, numerical modelling
simulations and tissue phantoms are preferred [49]. Helical
antenna are best suited for ingestible capsules because they
provide omnidirectional
radiation distribution, circular
polarization, and consistent bandwidth across diﬀerent tis-
sues [50, 51]. The PillCam SB has used helix antenna
(width = 8 mm, diameter = 5 mm) with seven turns within
its internal structure, which takes up considerable real estate
within the capsule. As an alternative, the Sonopill uses a con-
formal helix antenna that wraps around the exterior shell of
the capsule to conserve interior space.

Modelling the channel attenuation of RF signals between
the endoscopy capsule systems and the external receivers has
been previously attempted for the ISM 2.4 GHz band and the
402 to 405 MHz Medical Implant Communication Service
(MICS) band [52, 53]. The ISM 2.4 GHz band supports high
rate of data transfer that is appropriate for several wireless
applications but leads to higher chances of interference from
other wireless devices, greater attenuation, and larger power
consumption [53]. On the other hand, the 402 to 405 MHz
MICS band has reduced attenuation,
lower interference
from other wireless devices, and requires low power but does
not support high rate of data transfer [53]. Previous studies
have computed the path loss (PL) and speciﬁc absorption
rate (SAR) using homogeneous or heterogeneous tissues
and often complemented by simulation results from 3D elec-
tromagnetic solvers, such as the SEMCAD-X package
(SPEAG, Zurich, Switzerland) [52, 53]. The conductivity
and dielectric constant varies for the diﬀerent tissues, and
earlier studies have employed models of the muscle tissue,
skin tissue, and esophagus tissue to characterize these varia-
tions [53]. The path loss is directly proportional to medium’s
conductivity and inversely proportional to the square root of
medium’s permittivity [52]. The path loss also increases
when the separation between the antennas is increased or
when the antennas are misaligned [52]. To give some quan-
titative insights on the attenuation of the RF signals through
the human tissue, one study modelled a capsule system with
a spiral antenna [53]. At 402 MHz, the reﬂection coeﬃcient
was between -5.5 dB and -7 dB with the -5 dB bandwidth
around 45 MHz [53]. The path loss ranged from 58 dB in

the muscle tissues to 61 dB in the esophagus tissue using
aligned antennas separated by a distance of 250 mm, which
was considered satisfactory for eﬀective data communication
in capsule endoscopy systems [53]. For the same setup, the
peak spatial SAR was around 2.2 mW/kg, which was con-
siderably lower than the 2 W/kg limit set by the Interna-
tional Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection
(ICNIRP) [53].

Some examples of commercial wireless sensor nodes
(available as one complete board) are the Mica2DOT (by
Crossbow), T-node (by SOWNet), Sensium (by Toumaz),
and Tmote Sky (by Sentilla) [54]. The Mica2DOT sensor
node (dimensions: 58 × 32 × 7 mm3, weight: 18 g) uses the
ATmega128L microcontroller
(8 MHz, 4 k SRAM, and
128 k ﬂash memory). It operates at 38.4 kb/s data rate and
multiple frequency bands (868/916 MHz and 433 MHz)
while consuming 135 mW power at 3.3 V supply. The T-
node is comparable to the Mica2DOT in its physical dimen-
sion (23 mm diameter), operating frequencies, and data rates
(50 kb/s). The T-node uses a separate chip for the 10-bit
ADC, 128 k ﬂash memory, and 4 k SRAM. However, the data
transmission rates of both these sensor nodes are low for
reliable video capsule endoscopy. To accommodate faster
data rates, a high frequency telemetry system (1.2 GHz and
20 MHz bandwidth, 20 Mb/s data rate) has been demon-
strated, even though the 1.2 GHz frequency band is unavail-
able for medical device applications [55]. With rising
demand for consumer electronics, a number of low-power
Bluetooth System-on-Chip (SoCs) chipsets are now avail-
able, such as CC2540 and CC2650MODA by Texas Instru-
ments, nRF1822 by Nordic Semiconductor, and BGM11S
by Silicon Labs [45].

2.3. Examples of Sensors, Devices, and Circuits for Ingestible
Capsules. Below are some examples of sensors, devices, and
circuits within experimental capsules to measure the gut
pH, core body temperature, gastrointestinal motility, and
medical adherence.

(a) A radiotelemetry capsule was designed for the
assessment of pH and core body temperature within
the gastrointestinal tract [56]. The capsule had inte-
grated a pH ISFET device and a silicon temperature
sensor. The ASIC chip was fabricated in a 0.6 μm
CMOS process. The chip included a sensor interface
(six operational ampliﬁers and a multiplexer), timer
(with 32 kHz RC relaxation oscillator), and a system
scheduler (ﬁnite state machine with a 10-bit ADC).
A double-sided printed circuit board (PCB) was used
to assemble the ASIC chip, two SR48 silver oxide
batteries, a magnet for telemetry, and RF transmitter
(operating at 433.92 MHz). The capsule (36 × 12 mm,
8 g) had a power consumption of 15.5 mW in the
active mode. The capsule was operational for 42
hours during in vitro testing in artiﬁcial gastric and
intestinal solutions

(b) A wireless

tablet-shaped ingestible capsule was
developed to monitor the core body temperature

[57]. Power was generated by a battery with gold and
magnesium electrodes, and activated by gastric acid.
The battery voltage output was boosted and stored in
a 220 μF ceramic capacitor. The ASIC chip was
fabricated in 0.6 μm CMOS
and
included a temperature sensor, microcontroller, a
resonant circuit, sequencer, coder, modulator, and
transmission coil. Data transmission was carried
out with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modula-
tion at 13.56 MHz, followed by wireless telemetry
using magnetic ﬁeld coupling

technology

(c) A wireless capsule was fabricated in 0.18 μm CMOS
technology to identify gastrointestinal motility disor-
ders. The capsule integrated three sensors (pH, tem-
perature, and pressure), low power ASIC, batteries,
RF transceiver, and Helix antenna [58]. The external
data recorder had a RF transceiver with antenna,
batteries, multimedia card, and migrating motor
complex. A computer workstation performed the
data preprocessing and analytics. The sensing units
were a thermistor, pH-sensing ISFET, and a C29
AKTIV pressure sensor. The ASIC chip had an
8-bit microcontroller, clock, and power manage-
ment modules and 18-bit ADC, communication
processing unit, and memory. The RF transceiver
used FSK modulation to transmit and receive data
at 9.6 Kb/s with a 434 MHz center frequency. The
chip (5 mm × 5 mm) used a 3.3 V supply voltage,
2-8 MHz clock frequency, and 300 μA current drain-
age at 2 MHz. The capsule was tested on three human
volunteers and 20 cases of human experiments in
multiple hospitals. While its data analytics could not
distinguish patients with astriction or diarrhea, its
clustering algorithm could correctly recognize 83.3%
of patients with absent gastrointestinal motility

(d) As an alternative to batteries for powering the capsule
electronics, wireless power transmission was demon-
strated in a radiotelemetry capsule robot [59]. Two
separate communication bands were used—a lower
frequency for power transmission (13.56 MHz) and a
higher frequency for data carriers (433.92 MHz). The
capsule robot (10 mm × 25 mm) had pressure and
temperature sensors, FSK modulation transceiver
(data rate of 112 kbps, 433.92 MHz located in the
ISM band), class-E power ampliﬁer and oscillator,
16-bit ADC, timer module, ﬂash storage module,
power management module, and signal-processing
microcontroller [59]. The receiving coil within the
capsule induced a voltage by inductive link with the
transmitter to receive up to 280 mW of wireless power
at 13.56 MHz. The sampling rate of the capsule robot
was 0.6 Hz (i.e., 1 sample per 1.67 seconds), which
was suﬃcient to capture the gastrointestinal motility
signals in humans (that are from 1 to 18 cycle per
minute). A data recorder was worn around patient’s
waist and used a multimedia card to store incoming
data at 433.92 MHz and later pass it to a workstation

(e) The Proteus Digital Health platform consisted of an
ingestible sensor and wearable patch to track poor
medication adherence, especially in patients who
self-administer their prescriptive drugs at home
[60]. Its ingestible sensor (1 mm × 1 mm × 0:3 mm,
CMOS integrated circuit) was activated by gastric
ﬂuids to transmit signals at 10-30 kHz and 200-800
bits/sec using BPSK modulation. The data pod
within the wearable patch had power circuits, low
noise ampliﬁer,
custom system-on-chip (SoC),
LEDs, accelerometer, temperature sensor, Bluetooth
radio, ceramic radio, and coin cell battery. The data
pod received and decoded the signals from the
ingestible sensor, in addition to monitoring the step
count, body angle, and heart rate. The data stored in
the data pod’s ﬂash memory was transferred to a
mobile device using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
protocols. The ingestible sensor had a high detection
accuracy of over 98% in 1,200 unique ingestions
recorded across 14 individuals [60].

3. Capsule Navigation and Localization in the

Gastrointestinal Tract, Capsule
Placement Devices

Most wireless ingestible capsules rely solely on the natural
peristalsis movement to navigate the digestive tract. Capsule
movement using peristalsis is satisfactory when capsule’s
orientation, velocity, and resident time within each gastroin-
testinal region are less important. However, guided capsule
movement using microrobotics and localization techniques
is
(e.g., magnetic actuation and electrical stimulation)
desired for taking a closer view of speciﬁc regions of the gas-
trointestinal tract or controlling the resident time in a spe-
ciﬁc region [6, 8].

3.1. Navigation by Magnetic Actuation and Robotic
Manipulators. Magnetic actuation employs electromagnetic
coils or permanent magnets to generate and control the
magnetic ﬁelds for capsule navigation and localization
within the gastrointestinal tract [61–63]. Electromagnetic
systems modulate the magnetic ﬁeld strengths by changing
the coil current, though high coil currents lead to Joule heat-
ing and safety concerns [61]. Compared to electromagnetic
coils, permanent magnets are cost-eﬀective and have a com-
pact form factor. In conjunction with handheld devices or
robotic guiding systems, permanent magnets within a cap-
sule can apply desired forces and torque to the capsule,
thereby facilitating better orientation during imaging and
faster transit speeds through the gastrointestinal tract. Mag-
netic steering systems may have three types of propulsion:
translational, rolling, or helical. Translational steering sys-
tems use nonrotational magnetic ﬁelds, while rolling and
helical propulsion systems require rotating magnetic ﬁelds.
Today, magnetic steering systems can have ﬁve degrees of
freedom (DOF) (i.e., three translational DOF and two rota-
tional DOF) as demonstrated by a team of researchers build-
ing a wireless capsule gastroscope with a singular permanent

Advanced Devices & Instrumentation

magnet system [64]. The team used an external robotic mag-
netic manipulator with 6-DOF to maneuver the capsule. A
magnetic force controlled capsule’s position and translation
while a magnetic torque controlled capsule’s rotation and
heading. The 5-DOF manipulation of the magnetic capsule
was tested in an in vitro environment simulating a ﬂuid-
ﬁlled stomach [64]. On the commercial front, Stereotaxis
has a number of products involving the “robotic magnetic
navigation” (RMN) technology. Stereotaxis Niobe RMN sys-
tem uses two robotically controlled magnets to adjust the
magnetic ﬁeld and precisely steer a catheter (with a magnet
at its tip) inside a patient. The Stereotaxis Genesis RMN sys-
tem uses smaller magnets (compared to the Niobe system)
with better ﬂexibility of the robotic arms, improved patient
safety and outcomes, and unprecedented responsiveness to
physician control during procedures.

3.2. Navigation by Electrical Stimulation. Besides magnetic
actuation, electrical stimulation has been investigated for
guiding the locomotion of ingestible capsules through the
gastrointestinal tract [65]. In one study, a radio-controlled
electrostimulation capsule
con-
structed having a RF receiver, decoder system, three 3 V lith-
ium batteries, and two peripheral nervous system electrodes
[66]. The electrodes reached a maximum voltage of 18 V. An
external controller was used to change the amplitude and
period of electrical stimulations, which directly aﬀected cap-
sule’s velocity. The electrical stimulation of intestinal walls
allowed for capsular propulsion of up to 3.4 mm/s in the
aboral direction. In vivo tests using porcine intestinal tracts
yielded a correlation between capsule’s speed and voltage
amplitude, with the optimal voltage amplitude between 6 V
and 9 V. In another study, a predictive mathematical model
for the electrostimulated capsular motion in the small intes-
tine was built using Stokes’ drag equation and regression
analysis [67]. The model considered friction and contraction
force as the primary forces acting on a capsule during its
transit. The model simulations provided the optimal shape
and size of the capsule. Thereafter, actual capsules were con-
structed having similar internal features and having two sets
of electrodes to allow for movement in the oral and aboral
directions. The capsules were tested in 72 experiments with
stimulations having a constant voltage and duration (i.e.,
6 V, 5 millisecond pulse duration) and various frequencies
(i.e., 10 Hz, 20 Hz, and 40 Hz). The experiments yielded an
average forward velocity of 2:91 ± 0:99 mm/s and an average
backward velocity of 2:23 ± 0:78 mm/s for the capsules.
Unlike magnetic actuation, the safety and eﬃcacy of electri-
cal stimulation techniques still needs further validation
through clinical studies to realize its anticipated commercial
success.

3.3. Capsule Placement Devices. Capsule placement devices
have been developed for individuals who are candidates for
video capsule endoscopy but have diﬃculty swallowing the
video capsule or passing it through the pylorus. Such an
individual may have known or suspected motility disorders
or anatomical abnormalities (e.g., dysphagia, gastroparesis,
or large hiatal hernias) that could result in stalled capsules

if directly swallowed through the mouth. The capsule place-
ment device is used to facilitate direct endoscopic placement
of video capsules into the stomach or duodenum while pos-
ing minimal intubation risks to the esophagus.

As an example, the AdvanCE capsule endoscopy delivery
device by STERIS has a sheath (diameter = 2:5 mm, length
= 180 cm) and a clear capsule cup for atraumatic capsule
deployment into the stomach or duodenum. The capsule
cup ﬁrmly holds the video capsule during endoscopic intu-
bation of the esophagus, and the capsule is then released
by pulling an outer handle upon reaching the target GI
section. The AdvanCE device is compatible with most video

mm to 26:5 mm), such as those manufactured by Olympus,
Given Imaging, and IntroMedic. By directly placing the cap-
sule within the stomach, the battery life spent passing
through the esophagus or stomach is saved.

4. Commercialized Capsules for Physiological

Status Monitoring

Below are examples of commercial ingestible capsules to
monitor the core body temperature, gut pH and acid reﬂux,
and intestinal gases. Table 3 lists the companies for physio-
logical status monitoring, sample products, dimensions, fea-
tures, speciﬁcations, and clinical applications.

4.1. Core Body Temperature Monitoring. Maintaining the
core body temperature consumes approximately 40% of
body’s energy expenditure [68]. The core body temperature
is not ﬁxed but can ﬂuctuate depending on the amount of
food or drinks consumed, environmental factors, and phys-
ical ﬁtness of the individual [69, 70]. Measurements of the
core body temperature can be made invasively through the
oral, esophageal, or rectal cavity. Oral and esophageal read-
ings are not often accurate, while rectal temperatures are
inconvenient. The core body temperature can also be pre-
dicted from the skin temperature and heat ﬂux measure-
ments at diﬀerent body sites, but the method is not reliable
in outdoor settings. As an alternative to invasive and indirect
ingestible capsules are
temperature monitoring methods,
capable of unobtrusively tracking the internal body temper-
ature in mobile users, such as athletes, ﬁre ﬁghters, emer-
gency care responders, and soldiers [71–73]. Capsule-based
monitoring of the basal body temperature while sleeping
helps to manage the inner-body clock and sleep-wake
rhythm [72, 74, 75]. Continuous, real-time monitoring of
the core body temperature can assist people to stay within
safe levels of hyperthermia while preventing overexertion,
heat stress, and heat stroke. Some examples of commercial
capsules
core body temperature monitoring are
described below:

oscillates at a frequency relative to the core body
temperature. This creates a corresponding magnetic
ﬂux, and the information is transmitted to the Cor-
Temp Data Recorder (262 kHz to 300 kHz). The pill
has been applied to the detection and prevention of
heat stress and heat-related illnesses for sports,
research, industry, and medicine

(b) The eCelsius by BodyCap is an ingestible electronic
capsule for the continuous monitoring and wireless
transmission of core body temperatures (Figure 3).
The eCelsius Medical has been used to diagnose a
patient’s febrile state for applications in sleep disor-
ders, oncology, and infectious diseases. The eCelsius
Performance is designed for athletes and swimmers
who need continuous core temperature monitoring
without any constraints on the subject. Their
eViewer monitor manages the data from up to 3 cap-
sules within a 1-3-meter range. Some other eCelsius
applications include the early detection of peak fever

during infections and chemotherapy and tracking
the circadian rhythm of core body temperatures for
sleep analysis

4.2. pH Monitoring and Gastroesophageal Reﬂux Testing.
Ingestible wireless pH testing capsules are being used to
monitor pH levels over time for improved gastrointestinal
diagnostics. One application area is esophageal pH testing,
which is important for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal
reﬂux disease (i.e., GERD) where a person suﬀers from fre-
quent acid reﬂux. GERD has been traditionally diagnosed
by a nasopharyngeal-wired pH monitoring system that

causes patient discomfort. After swallowing the pH monitor-
ing capsules, the pH proﬁles can be analyzed for four gastro-
intestinal landmarks: ingestion, pylorus, ileocecal valve, and
excretion [76]. Ingestion is characterized by a rapid temper-
ature rise and a rapid pH drop (>3 pH values), pylorus is
characterized by a rapid pH rise (>3 pH values), ileocecal
valve is noted by a rapid pH drop to ≤6.5, and excretion is
noted by a rapid temperature drop [76]. Below are some
examples of commercial ingestible wireless pH testing cap-
sules for the gastrointestinal tract.

(a) The Bravo Reﬂex Testing System is an ambulatory
pH test and primarily assists in the diagnosis of
GERD symptoms. The esophageal pH is measured
by an antimony pH electrode every 6 seconds over
a period of 96 hours. This extended time period of
pH monitoring increases the chances to detect reﬂux
events and accurately determine the associated
symptoms

(b) Jinshan Science and Technology has developed a
wireless pH capsule system to record up to 96 hours
of data. The wireless pH capsule is designed to be
in size (6:0 × 5:5 × 26:5 mm) and weight
small
(1.4 g). A conveyor is used to deliver the wireless
pH capsule to the lower esophageal
sphincter
(LES), followed by vacuum suction to attach the cap-
sule to the mucosa. The pH sampling is fast (i.e.,
every 3 seconds), and the range of data transmission
is suﬃciently large (i.e., within 3 meters) for patient
comfort. After traversing the gastrointestinal tract,
the wireless pH capsule is naturally excreted from
the body. An accompanying recorder provides auto-
matic pairing with the pH capsule, double data pro-
tection, and improved user operability. Its data
analysis software has options to autodetect events
to reduce editing time, perform statistical calcula-
tions, and generate customized reports

(c) The SmartPill capsule endoscope was designed for
the evaluation of gastric emptying and the measure-
ments of transit time through the small bowel and
colon. The standard techniques of studying gastric
emptying by whole gut transit scintigraphy (WGTS)
and radio-opaque markers require long-time dura-
tions and provide information only about colonic
transit. The SmartPill capsule has integrated sensors
to transmit data on the pH, temperature, and pres-
sure in the gastrointestinal tract at regular intervals.
The SmartPill MotilGI software helps to estimate
diﬀerent time parameters which have relevance to
the gastrointestinal functioning. For instance, the
whole gut transit time is calculated as the time
between capsule’s ingestion and its exit from the
body (denoted by a sudden drop in temperature or
loss of signal). The software also calculates the gas-
tric motility index and gastric contractions per
minute. The gastric residence time is calculated from
capsule’s ingestion to the sudden pH rise (i.e., >3 pH
units from the acidic gastric region to the alkaline

duodenum). The transit times through the ileum,
cecum, and colon are calculated from the raw data
related to pH, temperature, and pressure at various
gastrointestinal sections [77, 78]. A clinical study
used the SmartPill capsule to show that diabetic indi-
viduals with gastroparesis exhibited delayed colonic
transit which correlated with delayed gastric empty-
ing [79].

4.3. Sensing of Intestinal Gases. The process of carbohydrate
digestion breaks down the poly- and disaccharides into
absorbable monosaccharides which is followed by carbohy-
drate absorption in the intestine [30]. The unabsorbed car-
bohydrate reaches the colon where it is fermented by the
bacteria [80, 81]. This bacterial fermentation can lead to
excess gas production and other discomforts (e.g., bloating,
diarrhea, abdominal distension, and irritable bowel syn-
drome (IBS)) [82]. Apart from the metabolic activity of
intestinal bacteria with unabsorbed food content, various
chemical conversions and enzymatic perturbations can pro-
duce diﬀerent gases in the gastrointestinal tract, such as
hydrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, and methane
[83]. The malabsorption of various carbohydrates and small
intestine bacterial overgrowth are commonly monitored
from end-expiratory breath samples for levels of hydrogen
or carbon dioxide [84]. Breath tests can also reveal elevated
levels of methane in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting
higher colonization of methanogens (e.g., Methanobrevibac-
ter smithii) in the gut who scavenge the hydrogen and pro-
duce methane as a by-product [85, 86]. The presence of
both hydrogen and methane in the breath of individuals is
correlated to higher body mass index and percent body fat
[86]. However, studies show that hydrogen breath tests can
give divergent or false-negative results due to several factors
such as the presence of oral bacterial ﬂora, nonhydrogen-
producing bacteria, gastrointestinal motor disorders, or
improper adherence to carbohydrate diet [35, 84]. Further-
more, the lack of accurate diagnosis in regard to the point
of origin of the gas and very low signal-to-noise ratio limits
the conclusions that can be drawn from the hydrogen
breath test.

With the inherent deﬁciencies of breath tests and the
inconvenient nature of other techniques (e.g., tube inser-
tions, ﬂatus analysis, and whole-body calorimetry), indirect
measurements of gas production by in vitro fecal fermenta-
tion systems using colonic bacteria has drawn attention from
experts [87]. Here, an oxygen-free bacterial incubation envi-
ronment is created, and fecal inocula is cultured with nutri-
ents on a ﬁber substrate. The gas released is absorbed in solid
phase microextraction ﬁbers and assessed for its composi-
tion using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry
(GC-MS). To circumvent the oﬄine gas analysis, portable
gas-sensing capsules have been investigated to measure the
intestinal gas species from in vitro fecal fermentation by
employing electrochemical, calorimetric, or optical sensing
modalities [87].

Wireless capsules have been demonstrated for the mea-
surement of intestinal gas proﬁles in vivo and the discovery
of biomarkers related to the gut microbiota [35]. These

studies can potentially help to formulate better diets which
positively inﬂuence the gut microbiota and colon health
[81, 83]. A human pilot trial was conducted to test the eﬃ-
cacy of ingestible electronic capsules that monitor diﬀerent
intestinal gases (i.e., oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide)
[88]. The capsule employed semiconducting metal oxide-
based sensors and thermal conductivity sensors to measure
the gas concentrations. The polyethylene capsule shell
housed the gas sensors, temperature sensor, microcontroller,
transmission system (433 MHz), and silver oxide batteries.
Ultrasound was used to evaluate the physical location of
the capsule and the transit time within diﬀerent sections of
the gut.
four healthy volunteers were
recruited, and subjected to high-ﬁber and low-ﬁber diets.
The results showed that the oxygen-equivalent concentra-
tion proﬁle was an accurate marker for tracking the physical
location of the capsule, while hydrogen gas proﬁles repre-
sented the food fermentation patterns in the diﬀerent sec-
tions of the gut. With high-ﬁber diet, there was only a
small increase in hydrogen and carbon dioxide within the

colon, which are indicative of minimal colonic fermentation.
With low-ﬁber diet,
there was an increase in colonic
hydrogen and carbon dioxide with a signiﬁcant shift in
the microbiota as conﬁrmed from metabolomics analysis
of fecal samples. The team founded the Atmo Biosciences
to commercialize their capsules (Figure 4) that can mea-
sure the intestinal gases at the source and identify diges-
tive issues using clinical analysis and predictive algorithms
[1, 35, 87, 89–92].

5. Commercialized Capsules for Mechanical

Vibrations and Bioelectric Neuromodulation

Below are some examples of commercial vibrating capsules
for constipation relief and electroceutical capsules for obe-
sity and hormonal release.

5.1. Vibrating Capsules. Functional constipation is classiﬁed
as normal-transit, slow-transit, or outlet-transit types and
is generally manifested by abdominal discomfort, stomach

14

aches, and infrequent or painful defecation [93]. Current
treatment options for chronic constipation include ﬁber
supplements, stool softeners, osmotic and stimulant laxa-
tives, lubricants, prokinetics, guanylate cyclase-C agonists
(GC-C), and surgical management. The sustained eﬀective-
ness of the current treatment options for chronic constipa-
tion is not guaranteed due to their high recurrence rate,
poor patient compliance, and treatment side eﬀects. To
improve the consistency of treatment for the aforemen-
tioned conditions, vibrating capsule technologies have been
developed. Examples of commercial vibrating capsules for
the treatment of functional or chronic constipation are as
follows:

(a) Vibrant Capsule by Vibrant Ltd. is a nonpharmaco-
logical device to provide relief from constipation and
restore the complete spontaneous bowel movements.
As a chemical-free alternative to current treatment
options for chronic constipation, the Vibrant Cap-
sule generates mechanical vibrations in the wall of
the large intestine to induce bowel movements and
augment the normal circadian rhythm [93]. The
Vibrant Base Unit activates the capsule using an
electromagnetic signal. Diﬀerent vibration modes
can be programmed to regulate when and how to
vibrate the capsule. The Vibrant Capsule has been
tested on patients with Chronic Idiopathic Constipa-
tion and Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipa-
tion. In a study to evaluate its safety and eﬃcacy, it
was found that the vibrating capsule induced a sig-
niﬁcant increase in bowel movements per week in
23 out of 26 patients with no serious adverse events
[94]. The team established safety by quantifying
key parameters related to pathological anatomy,
physiology, stool, blood, and CT scans [94]. A sec-
ond study saw evidence of faster colonic transit time
with the Vibrant Capsule treatment and mentioned
that the vibration parameters require further optimi-
zation to accelerate the colonic transit in patients
with functional constipation [95].

(b) The VibraBot by AnX Robotica is designed to pro-
vide nonpharmacological relief from constipation.
One study tested the VibraBot capsule on the defeca-
tion frequency of beagle dogs [96]. An external con-
ﬁguration device enabled by a smartphone was used
to communicate with the VibraBot capsule. Once the
capsule reached the abdominal cavity, it was acti-
vated to generate abrupt vibrations at low, moderate,
or high frequencies (with a frequency ratio of
0.5 : 0.8 : 1.0, respectively). The VibraBot capsule pro-
duced mechanical vibration to stimulate peristalsis
in the large intestine. Their results indicated that
there was a signiﬁcant
after capsule ingestion,
increase in the daily defecation frequency and a
decrease in the capsule evaluation time

Electrical

and Bioelectric
Stimulation Therapy
Neuromodulation. Besides gastrointestinal motility disor-

ders, a class of electroceutical devices are being investigated
as therapeutic tool for obesity, hormone release, and neural
signaling [8, 97, 98]. Bioelectric neuromodulation (where
electrical stimulation is given at target sites along the gastro-
intestinal tract) has gained signiﬁcant interest as a method to
relieve gastrointestinal disorders, even though the present
outcomes are variable and the mechanisms of action are
unclear [11]. Bioelectric neuromodulation may stimulate
the vagus nerve, thoracolumbar connections, and sacral
nerves to inhibit gastrointestinal inﬂammation, treat feacal
incontinence, or block signals for feeding to reduce appetite
and treat morbid obesity [11, 99, 100]. While there are no
commercial examples of ingestible capsules for the electrical
stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract, there are two prece-
dents as implantable bioelectric neuromodulators for this
purpose. In 2015, the VBLOC vagal blocking therapy by
EnteroMedics Inc. was approved by FDA for the treatment
of obesity. The EnteroMedics VBLOC therapy involved
using its
implantable pacemaker-like device, Maestro
Rechargeable System, to intermittently block the vagal nerve
pathway to reduce hunger and generate earlier feelings of
fullness. This helps to promote a safe, healthy, chemical-free,
and sustainable weight loss alternative to bariatric surgery
(which has high surgical costs and increased rate of frequent
complications) [101–103]. A ReCharge Study to evaluate the
safety and eﬃcacy of the EnteroMedics Maestro Recharge-
able System found that VBLOC-treated patients reached
24.4% excess weight loss at 12 months [11].

6. Commercialized Capsules for Tracking

Medication Adherence

One emerging application of ingestible capsules is to moni-
tor and document the adherence to oral medications. The
common reasons cited by patients for not taking their med-
ications correctly can be forgetfulness, mental disorders,
emotional factors, dearth of information, poor communica-
tion with caregivers, and deliberate intent to omit doses
[104]. Poor medication adherence can result in treatment
failure, multidrug resistance, and disease transmission to
the community. This can also lead to frequent sickness, doc-
tor visits, and hospitalizations. The two current standards of
drug administration are directly observed therapy and self-
administered therapy. Surveillance technologies can help
monitor medical adherence, such as video recording by
smartphones and manual time-register of the opening of pill
bottles. However, the current methods do not ensure that all
the required medications are actually ingested regularly at
scheduled times. The clinicians also do not have rapid access
to the medical adherence information from their patients.
Connected medical devices are gaining attention for the
remote tracking of drug management and patient outcomes.
As an example of digital healthcare, a smart autoinjector,
AdhereIT by Noble and Aptar Pharma, can assist untrained
patients with at-home, self-administering of drug injections.
The AdhereIT device accurately detects an injection event
and lets the patient know (through audio, visual, or haptic
feedback) whether the injection was done correctly.

Ingestible capsules can provide an automatic technique
to record the ingestion of medications at a single-dose reso-
lution, thereby replacing direct observed therapy by wirelessly
observed therapy. The Proteus Discover system developed by
Proteus Digital Health is an ingestible capsule technology to
measure the eﬀectiveness of medication treatment, which in
turn helps to achieve desired clinical outcomes by tracking
patient’s health patterns. The Proteus Discover system con-
sists of ingestible sensors, wearable sensor patch, mobile
app for the patient, and portal for the provider [60]. Once
the medication and ingestible sensors are ingested, they
reach the stomach. The gastric acid in the stomach is used
by the ingestible sensors to generate a tiny biogalvanic signal
which is transmitted to the wearable patch. The biogalvanic
signal is not pH dependent and lasts for roughly 7 minutes.
The remaining contents of the ingestible sensor are inactive
and eliminated through the feces. The wearable patch
records the information about the ingested medications
(i.e., date, time, drug type, and its amount) and physiologic
data (i.e., step count, sleep quality, and circadian rhythm).
A digital record is sent to the mobile app and to the provider
through ProteusCloud after prior permission from the
patient. This helps to conﬁrm the ingestion of medications
on a dose-by-dose basis and hence compliance to the treat-
ment. The data also helps to quickly identify the root cause
for nonadherence such as lack of understanding, undesired
side eﬀects, or improper dosing schedules. The clinician
can then make decisions on whether to initiate, optimize,
or eliminate the medications. Proteus Discover was FDA
cleared in 2012 and has been tested in diﬀerent patient
populations (e.g., those with heart failure, hypertension,
or tuberculosis) [104–106]. In patients with hypertension,
the Proteus technology helped the community pharmacists
to identify the root cause of persistent hypertension. Wire-
less monitoring showed that two-thirds of the patients had
pharmaceutical resistance while the remaining one-third
took inadequate medications. A study on the adherence
to tuberculosis therapy found that
the Proteus Digital
Health system may be able to correctly identify ingestible
sensors with high accuracy,
low risk, and high patient
acceptance [105].

A collaboration between Proteus Digital Health and the
Japanese Pharmaceutical Company Otsuka led to Abilify’s
MyCite, which is the ﬁrst digital medicine approved by the
FDA to treat schizophrenia. The drug, Abilify (or Aripipra-
zole), is a prescriptive medication to treat mental disorders,
such as depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and
Tourette syndrome. MyCite is the smart pill version of the
drug Abilify that embeds a tiny Ingestible Event Marker
(IEM) sensor. This sensor is made of natural ingredients
and passes naturally out of the body after use. Upon ingest-
ing the smart pill, the IEM sensor transmits a Bluetooth sig-
nal to a wearable patch worn by the patient. The patch sends
the information to a smartphone app and subsequently to a
MyCite Dashboard which can be shared with a caregiver.
The Abilify manufacturers have mentioned that FDA has
evaluated and approved only the functions related to track-
ing the drug ingestion, and it is not known if Ability MyCite
can help with patient compliance.

7. Ingestible Capsules for Gut

Microbiome Analysis

Below are some examples of experimental ingestible capsules
to collect gastrointestinal samples and track the microbiome
within the gastrointestinal tract.

7.1. Capsules for Collecting Samples of the Gastrointestinal
Content. The retrieval of physical samples from speciﬁc loca-
tions in the gastrointestinal tract can help us understand the
composition and diversity of the microorganisms. The cur-
rently used stool test may not be reﬂective of the true intes-
tinal health because fecal samples have shown to display
greater bacterial richness and variation depending on factors
such as stool consistency, medications, preexisting diseases,
nutrition, and other personal traits [21, 107]. Tethered
endoscopy to retrieve samples of the gastrointestinal tract
is invasive, inconvenient, and incapable of reaching the dis-
tal regions of the small intestine. As an alternative, the gut
sample can be collected by using magnetic ﬁelds to actuate
the opening or closing of capsules. In recent past, magnetic
ﬁelds have been used to create actuation forces and torque
to control the movement of medical catheters, tissue biopsy
sampling, targeted drug delivery, ﬂexible endoscopes, and
3D endoscopy with scanning catheters [62]. As an example,
a drug delivery module was demonstrated using electromag-
netic actuation and active locomotion of the capsule through
the gastrointestinal tract [63]. The drug was initially encap-
sulated by axially magnetizing two soft magnetic rings. An
external magnetic ﬁeld was deployed to move the capsule
to the target lesion. Thereafter, a pulsating radial magnetic
ﬁeld was used to open up the capsule for drug release. A
plastic hinge ensured that the module returned to its initial
shape [63].

Building on the principles of magnetic actuation, there is
a recent interest in magnetically actuated devices for sam-
pling the gut microbiome. There are multiple factors to con-
sider while designing such capsules, such as the opening and
closing mechanisms, techniques for tight sealing, material
and structural strength, and sample crosscontamination.
There is a tradeoﬀ between capsule dimensions and the col-
lected volume, where smaller capsules can pass conveniently
through the gastrointestinal tract but would collect less sam-
ple volume, and vice versa. It is estimated that the DNA and
RNA concentrations in the samples should be at least 100-
500 ng/μL for reliable detection during downstream analysis
[108, 109].

A soft mobile robotic capsule was developed for nonin-
vasive sampling of the liquid digesta [62]. Each of the two
halves of the capsule contained a disk magnet (6 mm in
diameter, 3 mm in thickness) and were held together by a
ﬂexure hinge made from an elastomer composite reinforced
with carbon ﬁber. Silicon rubber was the material for the seal
rim, while polydopamine was used as the biocompatible
coating for capsule’s inner surfaces. The capsule was nor-
mally closed when ingested from the mouth. An external
magnetic ﬁeld generated a torque to open up the two halves
of the capsule to encapsulate the gut content. An opposite
magnetic torque was generated to create an intermagnet

16

force that sealed the capsule back to its normally closed con-
ﬁguration. With a capsule volume of 42 mm3, the device col-
lected 18 to 61 mg of gut content from pigs during in vivo
studies. This amount of content was suﬃcient as 10 mg of
material yields around 1.5 μg of DNA and 4 μg of RNA
[110, 111]. Another study demonstrated the use of a highly
absorbent hydrogel to ﬁrst collect the gut microbiome and
then automatically seal the capsule by mechanical actuation
of the hydrated gel [112]. The capsule dimensions were
9 mm in diameter and 15 mm in length. A pH-dependent
enteric coating was made with cellulose acetate phthalate
(CAP) to keep the capsule closed at pH values less than 5.0
and to slowly degrade at higher pH. The inner surface of
the capsule was treated with plasma and PEG to create a
superhydrophilic surface for easy wicking and ﬂow of gut
content. The performance of the capsule in extracting and
retaining viable bacteria was tested in vitro using E. coli solu-
tions [112].

A soft capsule endoscope was constructed for the ﬁne-
needle biopsy of submucosal tissues in the stomach [113].
The capsule had an internal permanent magnet to respond
to changes in the external magnetic ﬁeld and indicate its
physical location. A series of electromagnets generated the
magnetic ﬁeld to control the orientation and rolling motion
of the capsule until the target location was reached. An
endoscope camera gathered positional data and other infor-
mation on the stomach, such as the detection of lesions.
Upon reaching the destination, magnetic torque was applied
to properly orient the capsule. Thereafter, magnetic force
was applied to engage a thin, hollow needle to retrieve and
store a tissue sample using the ﬁne-needle aspiration biopsy
technique. After sample collection, the needle was retracted
with a tether attached to the capsule. Ex vivo experiments
were conducted in a porcine stomach model with phantom
tumors located underneath the outer stomach wall and pro-
duced 85% yield with the capsule robot [113].

7.2. Capsules for Bacterial Biomarkers and Nucleic Acids.
Ingestible capsules have been housed with engineered
microbes to detect health-related biomarkers and with elec-
tronic readout modules to wirelessly communicate the sens-
ing signal at real-time [114]. This approach has beneﬁts over
current methods of probing the gut microbiome using plate
analysis of urine and stool samples [12, 115, 116].

In one study, genetically engineered probiotic E. coli bac-
teria was leveraged to construct two biological sensors (thio-
sulfate sensor and tetrathionate sensor) which can detect
colon inﬂammation and possibly lead to new methods to
study gut microbiota pathways [117]. In another study, an
ingestible microbioelectronic device (IMBED) capsule was
developed to detect gastrointestinal bleeding events. The tar-
get biomarker was heme that was released from lysed red
blood cells. The capsule combined engineered probiotic bac-
terial sensor with a bioluminescence detection circuit and
wireless communication electronics [118]. The probiotic E.
coli bacteria was housed within individual wells covered by
a semipermeable membrane and was engineered to internal-
ize the extracellular heme through an outer membrane
transporter, ChuA. Upon detecting the target biomarkers,

the heme-sensing genetic circuit was triggered to allow the
bacterial luciferase operon, luxCDABE, to emit biolumines-
cence. The optical signal was read by phototransistors, con-
verted to digital codes by a nanowatt-level
luminometer
chip, and transmitted wirelessly for data analysis. In vitro
studies were conducted on a porcine model for gastrointesti-
nal bleeding to correlate the dose-dependent heme input
from whole blood to the luminescence production. An oro-
gastric tube was used to deposit the IMBED capsule in pig’s
stomach, and photocurrent data was recorded for the next 2
hours. The above method was expanded to sense thiosulfate
and acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) that are biomarkers for
gut inﬂammation and infection, respectively.

In a separate study, an ingestible biomolecular sensing
system was developed for the detection of microbiome
nucleic acids in the gastrointestinal tract [119]. The device
ﬁtted within the FDA-approved capsule size of 000. The cap-
sule system was equipped with a ﬂuorescence-based sensor,
UV LED, optical waveguide, 1.55 V 12.5 mAh battery, and
(124 μW wireless
bidirectional communication features
receiver and 915 MHz FSK/OOK transmitter). The CMOS
ﬂuorescent sensor chip had a 15-pixel array where each pixel
had a 100 pM DNA detection limit. This detection limit was
suitable for detecting the gut microbiome distribution
in vivo.

8. Commercialized Platforms for Video

Capsule Endoscopy

Video capsule endoscopy is the speciﬁc implementation of
ingestible capsules designed to image the gastrointestinal
tract [120, 121]. Compared to tube endoscopes which are
invasively inserted through the oral or rectal cavity, capsule
endoscopes have the capability to reach and clearly capture
images inside the small bowel without causing discomfort
to the patient [38, 122, 123]. Capsule endoscopes have been
used to diagnose abnormal conditions in the gastrointestinal
tract, such as chronic refractory constipation, celiac disease,
and Crohn’s disease [9]. The two common applications of
small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) are the diagnosis of
suspected Crohn’s disease and obscure gastrointestinal
bleeding (OGIB) [124]. In fact, video capsule endoscopy is
the single most eﬀective endoscopic procedure to identify
the source of OGIB [125]. Colon capsule endoscopy is com-
monly used for incomplete colonoscopy and patients unwill-
ing to try regular colonoscopy [124]. Over the past two
decades, video capsule endoscopy has become safer, and
the rate of adverse events has declined as concluded from a
survey of 402 published studies involving 108,000 capsule
endoscopy procedures [126]. The capsules for endoscopy
are generally equipped with a high-resolution camera, LED
light source, wireless transmitter, diﬀerent sensors, and bat-
teries [127]. The patient may wear a portable receiver to
acquire, store, and even display the images captured.

Software. Below are some examples of commercial platforms
for video capsule endoscopy. Table 4 lists the companies for

video capsule endoscopy, sample products, dimensions, fea-
tures, speciﬁcations, and clinical applications.

(a) Medtronic oﬀers a series of PillCam capsule endos-
copy platforms for gastrointestinal care to detect
abnormalities, monitor disease progressions, and
evaluate treatment outcomes [124]. (i) The PillCam
SB 3 System consists of the SB 3 capsule, SB 3 sensor
belt, SB 3 sensor arrays, and SB 3 Recorder. The Pill-
Cam SB 3 capsule helps visualize the small bowel and
from obscure
monitor lesions which may result
bleeding, Crohn’s disease, or iron deﬁciency anemia
(IDA). Its image capture rate is changeable from 2
to 6 frames per second (fps). The PillCam Sensor
belt, sensor arrays, and PillCam Recorder 3 are worn
by the patient. The PillCam Reader Software v9 pro-
vides high-quality imaging and smarter video compi-
lation with a simple and accurate mapping of pill’s
progress through the small bowel and colon. These
system features help to identify pathologies with
greater diagnostic conﬁdence [128]. (ii) The PillCam
UGI capsule allows direct visualization of the upper
gastrointestinal tract to detect gross blood and diag-
nose bleeding events with conﬁdence. It employs a
variable frame rate technology where a faster frame
rate (i.e., 35 fps) is used in the initial 10 minutes,
and a slower frame rate (i.e., 18 fps) is used in the last
80 minutes of the procedure. (iii) The PillCam Colon
2 System consists of the Colon 2 capsule, sensor belt,
sensor arrays, and recorder. The PillCam Colon 2
capsule provides direct and accurate visualization of
the colon to identify pathologies, such as colon
polyps which can progress to colon cancer. The Pill-
Cam Colon 2 System is suitable for patients where
colonoscopy or sedation is not possible (e.g., those
with bleeding in the lower gastrointestinal region).
(iv) The PillCam Crohn’s capsule helps to directly
visualize the mucosa of the small bowel and colon
to detect subtle mucosal lesions for accurate disease
status. This capsule has an extrawide ﬁeld of view
(336 degrees) with two camera heads (168 degrees
each).

Apart from the video imaging capsules, the PillCam
Patency Capsule can be given to verify the gastrointestinal
tract is open and unobstructed prior to capsule endoscopy.
The patency capsule is made of dissolvable components
and a RFID tag that is detectable with X-rays. If the patency
capsule leaves the body before dissolving (i.e., within 24 to
30 hours after ingestion), the gastrointestinal tract is con-
ﬁrmed passable or “patent” for the PillCam video capsules.
Otherwise, if the patency capsule is retained for a longer
period (i.e., greater than 30 hours), it starts to dissolve and
disintegrate suggesting a possible obstruction in the gastro-
intestinal tract.

(b) EndoCapsule 10 System was developed by Olympus
Medical. Its EC-S10 capsule has a 160° ﬁeld of view
and long observational time (i.e., up to 12 hours).

The EndoCapsule 10 software was built upon the
Olympus rich experience in optical-digital technolo-
gies to produce high-quality images of the small
intestine with less noise and less halation. The soft-
ware has a Red Color Detection function to detect
active bleeds and ulcers, 3D track function to visual-
ize capsule’s progression through the small intestine,
Omni Mode function to accelerate the reading time
with safe detection, and Image Adjustment function
to enhance tiny mucosal structures and alter color
tones. An all-in-one recorder combines the receiver
with a convenient belt-style antenna unit and the
viewer to capture or play back endoscopic images.
A recent multicenter study across nine European
centers tested the eﬃcacy of Omni Mode rapid
reading software on patients with possible anemia
or gastrointestinal bleeding [129]. A total of 2127
gastrointestinal
lesions were examined using the
normal mode (where every captured image was
reviewed) or the Omni Mode, where 647 lesions were
missed by normal mode and 539 lesions missed by
Omni Mode. While the clinical accuracy were similar
in both modes, the use of the Omni Mode reduced the
mean reading time of endoscopic images by 40% com-
pared to the normal mode (42.5 minutes) [129].
Another multicenter study involving 63 patients with
obscure gastrointestinal bleeding compared the eﬃ-
cacy of EndoCapsule and PillCam SB capsules on the
same patients [125]. The study found that both the
capsules were safe and displayed comparable diagnos-
tic yield with a subjective diﬀerence in the image qual-
ity in favor of the EndoCapsule

(c) MiroCam Capsule Endoscopy System was developed
by IntroMedic as part of its Human Body Commu-
nication Technology (Figure 5). The MiroCam
1600 capsule has a higher frame rate (i.e., 6 fps) to
provide a clear view of the small bowel while the
MiroCam 2000 capsule is double tipped and with a
lower frame rate (i.e., 3 fps) to provide more cover-
age of the bowel. The MiroCam Navi Controller uses
magnetic forces to control the movement of capsules
from the esophagus into the duodenum. The Miro-
Cam Receiver is attached to a disposable belt to view
and store the endoscopic images at real-time. The
MiroView 4.0 software has a new Express View fea-
ture to remove redundant images and detect abnor-
mal lesions, ulcers, bleeding, and polyps

(d) NaviCam Capsule System by AnX Robotica Corpo-
ration does not rely on natural peristalsis but is
rather maneuvered by magnetically controlled
robotics. The NaviCam capsule has a permanent
magnet inside its dome and is activated by a capsule
locator device that uses a magnetic sensor to ensure
the NaviCam capsule is still present
inside the
patient. There is an ergonomic sensor belt and data
recorder. The capsule is guided through the gastro-
intestinal tract by an external C-arm type magnet

an alternative to standard colonoscopy and does
not require bowel preparation prior to the proce-

cer screening). Once the C-Scan Cap capsule is

low dose of X-ray beams (mean radiation dose
of 0.04 mSv) which interact with the ingested con-
trast agents,
the
colon. The X-ray detectors within the capsule con-
stantly measure the number of reﬂected X-ray
ﬂuorescence photons and the Compton back-
scattered photons to estimate the distance between
the capsule and inner wall of the colon. The raw
images from the C-Scan Cap are transmitted and
stored onto the C-Scan Track comprising three
patches worn on patient’s back. After the proce-
dure, the C-Scan Cap capsule is excreted naturally.
Thereafter, the C-Scan View software analyzes the
scanned data and create 3D maps of colon’s inner
surface to detect precancerous polyps. A feasibility
study tested the safety and eﬃcacy of the C-Scan
Cap for the detection of colonic polypoid lesions
and masses [132]. The capsule results from 45
patients were compared with fecal immunochemi-
cal test (FIT) and ensuing colonoscopy. The data
indicated a 78% capsule sensitivity (when >50%
of the colon surface area was imaged) and 90%

(b) The Sonopill capsule combined the magnetically
controlled robotic capsule technology with microul-
trasound imaging for the diagnosis of gastrointesti-
nal cancers. Traditionally, the gold standard for
standard ﬂexible
colorectal cancer
screening is
endoscopy, which presents a higher procedural com-
plexity, severe discomfort to patients, and inability to
access all areas of the colorectal region [133]. The
Sonopill program was started from a 5-year, $10 M
grant to four U.K university partners (i.e., Glasgow,
Dundee, Heriot-Watt, and Leeds). Its capsule con-
sisted of a CMOS camera, electronic circuitry, two
microultrasound transducers, and a permanent mag-
net (neodymium iron boron (NdFeB)) [7]. The sys-
tem used microultrasound feedback control
to
precisely maneuver the robotic capsule and scan
the surface to capture ultrasound images. The micro-
ultrasound closed loop feedback was used to inform
the robot motion, and thereafter, robot’s
about
motion was used to reposition the microultrasound
transducer. An autonomous echo-ﬁnding algorithm
was implemented to regularly adjust capsule’s pose
and its acoustic coupling with the tissue. The output
data was combined to reconstruct the substrate and
detect features with a positional accuracy up to 1-
2 mm in living porcine models

Imaging-Guided Therapeutics and Gastrointestinal
Surgical Procedures. Apart from visualizing the gastrointes-
tinal tract for clinical diagnosis, capsule endoscopy systems
have been employed to deliver drugs at speciﬁc locations
of
tract, assess tablet disintegration
in vivo, perform ﬁne-needle aspiration biopsy, and treat
gastrointestinal hemorrhaging. In a study for controllable
drug delivery, a magnetic drug delivery capsule was devel-
oped consisting of a drug chamber, magnets, copper coils,
and electronic modules [134]. When the copper coils were
electrically activated, the magnetic force detached the drug
chamber from capsule’s body to release the drug in its
vicinity. In a separate study to determine the timeline of
tablet disintegration within the gastrointestinal tract, para-
cetamol tablets were retroﬁtted to an ingestible capsule
and administered to beagle dogs [135]. The time taken
for tablet’s in vivo dissolution was obtained from its
plasma concentration proﬁle and visual conﬁrmation from
the camera capsule. This technique provides a comfortable
alternative to balloon endoscopy.

Gastrointestinal hemorrhaging is an umbrella term for
any form of bleeding that originates in the gastrointesti-
nal tract. The symptoms depend on both location and
severity but may include bright red blood in vomit,
cramps in the abdominal region, and shortness of breath.
In the United States, over 100,000 people suﬀer from
upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and men are twice as
likely to have upper gastrointestinal bleeding [136]. One
study showed the use of ingestible capsules to treat gas-
trointestinal hemorrhaging through balloon tamponade
eﬀect [137]. The capsule was equipped with a silicone
balloon that inﬂated by the gaseous reaction created by
mixing an acid (acetic acid, 5% concentration) and a base
(sodium bicarbonate). The gaseous byproduct
(carbon
dioxide) was funneled to the balloon to inﬂate it against
the gastrointestinal walls, thereby creating pressure and
blocking the source of hemorrhage. The capsule consisted
of three diﬀerent sections linked by ﬂexible joints. In vivo
experiments on a sedated pig showed that the balloon
was immediately inﬂated upon reaching the hemorrhage.
Another capsule technique for treating gastrointestinal
hemorrhage involved the wireless deployment of surgical
clips in order to close the wound [138]. The capsule
had a cylindrical shape (diameter = 12:8 mm and length
= 33:5 mm).
It was equipped with 4 magnets on the
external surface for magnetic steering, a nitinol (nickel-
titanium alloy) clip to close the wound, an electromag-
netic motor, and a communication module [138]. In vivo
experiments on pigs showed the successful blockage of
internal hemorrhage.

9. Materials and Energy Sources for Next-

Generation Ingestible Capsules

Next-generation ingestible capsules are being developed
using biocompatible and biodegradable materials, along with
biocompatible batteries and alternative energy sources as
discussed below.

22

9.1. Biocompatible Materials, Edible Food, and Nutrients.
Biocompatibility describes the ability of the capsule system
to exist in harmony with the gastrointestinal system. By fab-
ricating biocompatible capsule components, the risks of pro-
longed capsule retention can be mitigated [122, 139]. The
physical dimensions and mechanical characteristics of the
capsule also dictate its biocompatibility with the gastrointes-
tinal tract. For instance, the maximum size of capsule’s rigid
outer body is limited to the diameter of the smallest passage
within the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., 12:8 ± 7 mm). This spa-
tial constraint sets an upper limit on capsule’s functionality.
As such, ﬂexible biocompatible materials are sought that can
simultaneously address the issues of size limitation and pro-
longed capsule retention.

Research into biocompatible electronics for capsules has
garnered considerable interest [14, 140–143]. A team of
researchers printed active electronic devices on edible sub-
strates using temporary tattoo paper, biocompatible con-
ducting polymers, and inkjet circuit printing technology
[144]. The p-type and n-type organic ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor-
based circuits (OFETs) were fabricated and transferred onto
the surface of a hard gelatin capsule by soaking in water and
pressing them onto the target surface. The submicron thick
ethyl cellulose ﬁlm within the temporary tattoo paper served
as the transferrable substrate and as the gate dielectric of the
OFETs. The biocompatible materials used to form the tran-
sistors were poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and diﬀerent
donor–acceptor copolymers. While this work realized a sim-
ple logic inverter, it showed the possibility of using printable
edible electronics for ingestible capsules.

A commercial example of an ingestible capsule system
that incorporates biocompatible materials is the Ingestible
Sensor System (ISS) developed by Proteus Digital Health to
test the patient adherence to oral medications. Its Ingestible
Event Marker (IEM) sensor has an integrated circuit housed
within an edible, cellulose disc. Thin layers of copper and
magnesium (10 μm) form the biogalvanic battery on the sur-
face of the IEM sensor. The extractable amount of copper
and magnesium from a single IEM sensor was minimal com-
pared to the daily allowable intake levels (0.3% and 0.003%,
respectively) [145]. Ethyl citrate was extracted from the IEM
sensor as the organic species resulting from the breakdown
of triethyl citrate (considered a GRAS food additive and
inert material).

The design of ingestible capsules has beneﬁtted from the
emerging trends in transient electronics where the material
and devices can physically degrade in a controllable manner.
Within the gastrointestinal tract, the degradability and depo-
lymerization traits of the transient electronics can be tuned
based on its transit time or external triggers (e.g., pH, tem-
perature, light, or solubility in solvents found in the gastro-
intestinal
transient antennas were
developed in a degradable composite ﬁlm made of water-
soluble poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) [146]. The dissolution
rate and dielectric properties of the PVA ﬁlm was tuned by
doping with TiO2 nanoparticles. The fabricated patch anten-
nas degraded within one hour of water immersion and were
space-eﬃcient to ﬁt within capsules. Besides antennas, the
ﬂexible substrate ﬁlms have been chosen that conform to

tract). In one study,

the capsule walls. Biodegradable ﬁlms (e.g., polyanhydrides)
that can partially or
substrates
have been tested as
completely degrade at ﬁnite time points. The biocompatibil-
ity of substrates reduces the health and safety risks associ-
ated with long-term capsule retention beyond 24 to 48
hours. Flexible and stretchable components, such as anten-
nae, can be packaged in miniaturized form factors to facili-
tate the initial swallowing and transit and expanded to
larger form factors upon reaching the small bowel or colon
[8, 147]. On the other hand, sensors and microelectronics
are often compressed into mechanically rigid structures to
save the real estate within capsules.

The materials for transient electronics are being chosen
based on their inherent characteristics, such as permeability,
degradation rates, morphology, hydrophobicity or hydro-
philicity, chemical properties, and mechanical properties of
the polymer [115, 148, 149]. In a study on bioresorbable sil-
icon electronic sensors, devices were fabricated on silicon
nanomembranes, thin SiO2 layers, and magnesium foils
and molybdenum interconnects that can dissolve or disinte-
grate in a time-controlled manner [140]. Another study
demonstrated a range of functional transient devices fabri-
cated on polyanhydride substrates (~124 μm thick) where
transience was triggered by moisture and time-controlled
by the polymeric chemistry [150]. The anhydride groups in
the polymeric substrate absorbed the surrounding moisture
to cause its hydrolysis and eventually degrade into a viscous
liquid. Various transient electronic devices were fabricated
from metals (e.g., copper, nickel, and aluminum), semicon-
ductors (e.g.,
indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO)), and
dielectrics (e.g., magnesium oxide) [150].

categories of biocompatible materials

The material toolkit for next-generation ingestible cap-
sules can be constructed from a number of constituents in
edible food and nutrients (such as minerals, vitamins, inor-
ganics, organics, and food additives). Table 2 lists the diﬀer-
ent
for next-
generation capsules: substrates, ﬁllers, coatings, conductors,
electrodes, and electrolytes. To help choose the appropriate
biocompatible material, a system of nutrition recommenda-
tions and dietary reference intake (DRI) can be used as
reference, which is maintained by the U.S. National Acade-
mies and Institute of Medicine. As a note, the recommended
dietary allowance (RDA) indicates the suﬃcient daily intake
level of essential nutrients, while the tolerable upper intake
level (UL) refers to the highest intake level of nutrients con-
sidered safe with no side eﬀects. Materials tabulated by the
US RDA include minerals, organic molecules, polymers,
and inorganic materials. Minerals that have tabulated RDA
and electrical properties can be used to create essential com-
ponents within ingestible electronic devices, such as the
anode, cathode, electrode, ﬂow cell ions, and active layer.
The body can tolerate a threshold of most materials before
the concentration within the blood stream and tissue
becomes detrimental [151]. In addition, FDA has classiﬁed
certain chemicals and substances as “Generally Recognized
As Safe” (GRAS) for common human consumption. The
preapproved safety of GRAS materials makes them good
candidates for use in ingestible capsules as they have a lesser
path of resistance for clinical trials.

9.2. Batteries and Alternative Energy Sources. Silver-oxide
button batteries are popular energy sources for portable elec-
tronics because of their high energy-to-weight ratio. How-
ever, silver-oxide button batteries occupy signiﬁcant real
estate within ingestible capsules and often become the decid-
ing factor for the capsule size. The shape and size of these
batteries pose potential obstruction and health risks in chil-
dren when swallowed [152, 153]. The alkaline solution
within ingested silver-oxide button batteries can cause severe
tissue damage in the mouth, vocal cord, trachea, or esopha-
gus [154, 155]. Lithium cells are more dangerous than silver-
oxide batteries, especially when ingested by children [153,
155]. When the alkaline electrolyte of the lithium cell leaks
into the
in contact with the
electrolyte-rich stomach ﬂuid, undesired electrical current
is generated. This results in the local production of hydrox-
ide ions and pH change within the stomach,
leading to
necrosis and potential fatalities in children [152, 156, 157].
Solid-state cells and biocompatible batteries are poten-
tially safer than conventional button batteries because there
is no leakage of toxic electrolytes or associated risks of inter-
nal tissue damage. Biocompatible batteries have a variety of
material choices for the anode (e.g., magnesium, zinc,
magnesium-aluminum-zinc alloy, or melanin), cathode
(copper, cupric chloride, iron, platinum, or manganese diox-
ide), and electrolyte (e.g., sodium chloride, phosphate buﬀer,
saliva, or simulated gastric ﬂuid). As an example, a biocom-
patible galvanic cell was demonstrated where gastric acid
and intestinal ﬂuids served as the electrolyte [158]. A redox
reaction occurred between the dissolving metallic anode
(zinc or magnesium) and an inert cathode (pure copper
metal). In vitro experiments indicated that the zinc anode
was better suited for longer term use because the magnesium
anode was prone to greater corrosion and shorter lifetime
(<24 hours). Their energy harvesting system was tested in
a porcine stomach to power the temperature-sensing elec-
tronics housed within the capsule and wirelessly transmit
the signal to a base station (as a 920 MHz, FSK modulated
signal). The average amount of zinc absorbed in the body
from this galvanic cell (i.e., 27 mg/day) was estimated to be
below the recommended upper limit (i.e., 40 mg/day). A
drawback of biocompatible batteries is that the battery per-
formance can ﬂuctuate due to variations in the environmen-
tal conditions of the gastrointestinal tract.

Alternative energy sources have been explored for
ingestible capsules, including biofuel cells, nuclear batteries,
optical charging, and transducers of various types (e.g., ther-
moelectric, piezoelectric, electrostatic, electromagnetic, and
ultrasound). Within the ﬁeld of chargeable ingestible batte-
ries, a polysaccharide gel battery based on the Gibbs-
Donnan eﬀect (i.e., Donnan dialysis) was recently demon-
strated to ﬁght harmful bacteria in the oral cavity [159]. In
their work, electrochemical potential was generated by ionic
diﬀusion from potassium chloride saline gradients within
agarose gels. The battery and triboelectric nanogenerator
were created from biocompatible materials, such as agarose
gel, platinum, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polytetra-
ﬂuoroethylene (PTFE), chitosan/glycerol ﬁlm, and silicon.
An optimized battery conﬁguration produced an open cir-

cuit potential up to 177 mV and the nanogenerator was
capable of supplying 300 mV. A system using two such bat-
teries in series was demonstrated as an antibacterial electro-
stimulation device for the oral cavity. Their test results
showed that 90% of E. coli were inhibited after 30 minutes
of treatment.

Besides on-board energy sources, remote powering of
ingestible capsules using wireless power transmission have
been investigated by researchers [59, 160]. In one approach,
a Helmholtz transmitting coil was attached to the patient
and a ferrite-core three-dimensional receiving coil was
placed in the capsule. Electromagnetic ﬁelds were used to
energize the capsule, providing suﬃcient power
(i.e.,
330 mW to 500 mW) to the capsule for most of its functions.
The design and size of the antenna determined the fre-
quency of optimal transmission. As a drawback, wireless
power transmission is critically dependent on the distance
between the source and receiving antenna and capsule’s rel-
ative orientation to the incoming radiation. There is signiﬁ-
cant signal loss by the time the electromagnetic waves reach
the deep gastrointestinal tissues (where the ingestible cap-
sules typically operate).

10. Discussion: Present Challenges and Outlook

First and foremost, it is challenging for a clinic or hospital to
constantly assess and improve the endoscopic service perfor-
mance measures with root cause analyses of major events
and feedback to their gastroenterologists and medical staﬀ
[40]. Moreover, these procedures are not appropriate for
patients having gastrointestinal obstructions, peptic stricture
or ulcer disease, urethral strictures, urinary ﬁstulas, uncon-
trolled diabetes, swallowing disorders, prior gastrointestinal
surgery, and implanted electromedical devices. To avoid
electromagnetic interference during the time from capsule
ingestion to excretion, it is advised to stay away from sources
of powerful electromagnetic ﬁelds (e.g., MRI instrument).
There may be frequent signal loss, diﬃculties in knowing
the exact location of the capsule, or loss of battery power
before excretion [76]. On the technical side, there are high
software
costs
upgrades, and clinical validation that is expected to limit
the market growth of smart pills [5]. Furthermore, it is diﬃ-
cult to reconstruct and democratize the sensing and record-
ing circuitry from oﬀ-the-shelf components, which limits the
number of commercial ingestible capsule products [161].

associated with advanced microchips,

The procedures involving ingestible capsules have health
risks, such as capsule retention, aspiration, obstruction,
mucosal injury, internal bleeding, and irritation. In particu-
lar, capsule retention in the gastrointestinal tract can have
signiﬁcant health complications depending upon the preex-
isting conditions of the patient and nature of capsule mate-
rials [151]. A study found that capsule retention following
video capsule endoscopy was predominantly found in indi-
viduals with bowel disease (1.4% retention rate) and Crohn’s
disease (13% retention rate) where the retention of capsules
often resulted in gastrointestinal obstruction [162]. A survey
of 22,840 procedures using small bowel capsule endoscopy
showed a signiﬁcant retention rate for common indications

24

such as obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (1.2%), suspected
Crohn’s disease (2.6%), and neoplastic lesions (2.1%) [163].
Other underlying conditions for capsule retention are
obstructive tumors and diaphragm disease from the side
eﬀects of anti-inﬂammatory drugs [164]. Extended retention
of a rigid-shell capsule can result in lumen perforation and
capsule disintegration with undesired toxicity from released
materials. In such cases of prolonged capsule retention
(especially having small-bowel strictures), the retrieval of
capsule is assisted by conventional deep enteroscopy, push
enteroscopy, or motorized spiral enteroscopy [165]. To
address the risks of capsule retention, Medtronic has devised
medical procedures to evaluate the safety of patients before
proceeding with video capsule endoscopy. For instance, its
PillCam Patency Capsule is ingested by the patient prior to
video capsule endoscopy to check for known obstructions
and is possibly excreted within 30 hours. A study of 38
patients with risk factors of capsule retention showed that
the PillCam Patency Capsule was naturally excreted in most
cases, and video capsule endoscopy was safely performed
afterwards in those patients [166].

is nontrivial,

Clinical testing of capsule prototypes on humans and
laboratory animals
time-consuming, and
expensive. Because of interpatient variability in terms of dis-
ease nature and treatment history, the patients who volun-
teer for clinical trials may not be representative of a target
diseased group or the general healthy population [11]. It is
diﬃcult to correlate gastrointestinal parameters such as gas-
tric emptying time, pH, gastrointestinal motility, colon con-
tractions, and transit times both in healthy individuals and
patients with preexisting conditions (e.g., obesity, chronic
constipation, and diabetic gastroparesis) [79]. As an exam-
ple, a validation study showed that temperature-sensing
ingestible capsules have rapid temperature oscillations, espe-
cially in obese individuals, with temperature drifts compared
to electronic and mercury thermometers [68]. The same
study also revealed the current dearth of knowledge in relat-
ing the core body temperature to the body mass index, gen-
der, age, and daily movement and activity and presence of
food or anatomical location in the gut [68]. It is challenging
for diﬀerent
to optimize the experimental parameters
patients during video endoscopy, physiological sensing, or
stimulation. In fact, any capsule system and its procedure
have a large number of parameters with a range of possible
variations, which makes it diﬃcult to make informed guesses
and predict outcomes, especially in patients with gastrointes-
tinal disorders [11]. Synthetic gut models fail to emulate the
structure and functions of live gastrointestinal tracts, such as
peristalsis, bowel movement, and slippery mucosa layer.
Peristalsis, for example, can force the capsules to go through
certain sections of the gastrointestinal tract at diﬀerent
speeds, which may not allow suﬃcient time to take clear
images. This can lead to lesions and other diagnostic
pointers being overlooked or misread [167]. For video cap-
sule endoscopy, this can prevent the reliable acquisition of
high-resolution gastrointestinal images, reimaging and pin-
pointing the origin of a biological marker, and rapid reading
of the acquired images with acceptable speed and accu-
racy [168].

The outlook for ingestible capsules involves addressing
the present challenges and testing strategies for technical
advancements and patient adoption. The ﬁeld is moving
towards a single, multifunctional,
integrated circuit chip
with in-built CMOS image sensors, physiochemical sensors,
ASICs, memory units, transceivers, and antenna-in-package.
Novel materials are being investigated with properties to
encapsulate electronic components, perform energy harvest-
ing, provide mechanical strength for faster transit, and have
chemical properties for bio-absorption and degradability
[151]. In the near future, closed-loop feedback will become
essential to monitor the target parameters for gastrointesti-
nal disorders at quasi real time and to automatically adjust
the external control in a timely manner. The applications
of small bowel capsule endoscopy will be expanded and val-
idated for therapeutic functions such as for the treatment of
obscure gastrointestinal bleeding or the detection of mucosal
damage from drugs and NSAIDS injury [124]. As we better
understand the intricacies of the gut-brain axis connection,
the probiotics industry is emerging to be a big business for
the assessment, exploitation, and rebuilding of
the gut
microbiota and commensal balance [107]. In this context,
ingestible capsules could be developed to detect inﬂamma-
tory proteins, hormones, or metabolites which are indicative
viral infections or a modulated gut microbiome [169]. With
expanding knowledge of sacral and vagal nerve pathways
and underlying mechanisms, the emerging technologies of
bioelectric neuromodulation and gastric electrical stimula-
tion (GES) could be tailored and optimized for the treatment
of gut inﬂammation, obesity, gastroparesis, and fecal incon-
tinence [11]. The rising rates of gastrointestinal diseases and
cancers suggest that we will see further subspecializations in
therapeutic and diagnostic endoscopy with emphasis on
procedural training, computing skills, and service quality
[10]. The performance measures for endoscopic procedures
will evolve with time and aﬀect the organization, leadership,
staﬃng, quality and safety, and patient involvement [40].
Artiﬁcial intelligence and personalized treatments will play
a greater role in endoscopic therapeutics and diagnosis.
Lastly, video capsule endoscopy could eﬀectively comple-
ment existing procedures in surgery and radiology by estab-
lishing safe
and high-quality out-patient procedures,
reduced medical complications, and quicker diagnostics at
lower costs [10].
