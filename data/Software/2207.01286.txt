Abstract. Soft smooth particles in silo discharge show peculiar characteristics,
including, for example, non-permanent clogging and intermittent ﬂow. This paper
describes a study of soft, low-frictional hydrogel spheres in a quasi-2D silo. We
enforce a more competitive behavior of these spheres during their discharge by
placing an obstacle in front of the outlet of the silo. High-speed optical imaging
is used to capture the process of discharge. All particles in the ﬁeld of view are
identiﬁed and tracked by means of machine learning software using a MASK R-
CNN algorithm. With particle tracking velocimetry (PTV), the ﬁelds of velocity,
egress time, packing fraction, and kinetic stress are analysed in this study.
In
pedestrian dynamics, it is known that the placement of an obstacle in front of
a narrow gate may reduce the stress near the exit and enable a more eﬃcient
egress. The eﬀect is opposite for our soft grains. Placing an obstacle above the
oriﬁce always led to a reduction of the ﬂow rates, in some cases even to increased
clogging probabilities.

The eﬀect of obstacles near a silo outlet on the discharge of soft spheres

1. Introduction

The storage of granular materials in silos and their discharge through small oriﬁces
in the container bottom has been studied widely since more than one century. The
discharge dynamics of hard particles is practically independent of the pressure in the
granular bed [1–3]. The outﬂow rate Q of spheres is well described by Beverloo’s
equation [4, 5]. In two dimensions, it reads

√

Q = Cµ

g(W − kD)1.5,

(1)

where µ is the mass of the granulate per area, D is the particle diameter, W is the
oriﬁce width, C and k are dimensionless ﬁtting constants. Hard particles can form
permanent clogs when the outlet of a silo is smaller than a certain size [6, 7], which
for spheres is approximately ﬁve times the sphere diameter. The state of permanent
clogging can only be destroyed by external force, such as vibration of the container
or injection of pressurized air at the outlet. There are plenty of studies focusing on
reducing the probability of clogging, such as expanding the oriﬁce size [8], adjusting
the number of outlets and distances between outlets [9–11], or applying external
vibration [12, 13]. Another eﬀective method in some situations is to place an obstacle
inside the silo. The presence of such an obstacle in a certain height above the outlet
may decrease the probability of clogging. The mechanics behind this eﬀect is assumed
to be the reduction of pressure in the region of arch formation [14, 15]. The packing
fraction at the oriﬁce decreases when putting an obstacle in front of the outlet [16].
When the obstacle is placed in an optimal position in front of the oriﬁce, the outﬂow
rate can even increase [17]. These observations were made with hard, frictional grains.
However, other related systems such as pedestrians or animals exiting through a door
display similar features.

Pedestrian motion in narrow passages at high population density shows some
similarities with granular dynamics [18]. Although all pedestrians have individual
trajectories and destinations, their motion is principally inﬂuenced by repulsive
interactions with other individuals at high population densities. This can lead to self-
organized dynamics [19]. At very high density, pedestrians can organize in lanes [20],
which is similar to segregation in granular media [21]. The behavior of pedestrians
passing bottlenecks such as corridors or doors is in some respect analogous to granular
ﬂow in an hourglass [22]. Density is used as a key parameter, closely related to
pedestrian dynamics [23], but kinetic stress, i.e. the product of packing density and
velocity ﬂuctuations, is considered as another key factor leading to velocity changes
If pedestrians stay in a conﬁned, not too wide space,
towards the bottleneck [24].
the density at a bottleneck will surprisingly reduce [25].
If there is an obstacle in
front of the door, it can help alleviate the pressure in the area near the door and
decrease the probability of blocking the passage [26–29]. However, an obstacle does
not necessarily alter the pedestrian ﬂow rate [30]. Some studies point out the ’faster-
is-slower’ eﬀect [31,32], which means that pedestrians would pass the bottleneck faster
if they are under lower stress. A relation to friction was proposed [24]. In a simulation,
an ordered or ’crystalline’ structure was helpful for faster egress dynamics [33].

Soft granular materials, as studied here, are typically found in agriculture and
pharmacy. They combine properties of hard granular matter with some features of
animate objects. Soft grain ensembles exhibit quite diﬀerent characteristics in silo
discharge as compared to hard particles and show qualitatively novel features [34–39]
intermittency of ﬂow and avalanche statistics. This refers in
regarding clogging,

particular to hydrogel spheres, as elastic granular material with very low friction that
is incompressible but can easily be deformed. Elastic moduli are of the order of 10 to
100 kPa [40]. In silo discharge, the outﬂow rate depends on the pressure at the bottom
of the container and thus on the ﬁll height [34]. These soft particles can spontaneously
rearrange themselves during transient congestions [38]. We note that cattle or human
egress can show similar intermittent dynamics when passing a bottleneck [41].
In
the present study, we explore the eﬀects of an obstacle placed in front of a container
outlet for soft, low-frictional hydrogel spheres. An optical camera is used to record
the process of discharge focusing on the region near the obstacle. Machine-learning
based software, namely, a Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (MASK
R-CNN) was employed to precisely locate each particle. With the coordinates of the
particles, and a high enough video frame rate, it is possible to track each particle
in successive frames. In addition to measurements of the actual discharge rates as a
function of the obstacle position, we also extract ﬂow ﬁelds, local packing fractions
and the distribution of kinetic stress in the vicinity of the outlet. The latter is related
to the pressure during the discharge.

2. Experimental setup

The setup consists of a ﬂat box of 80 cm height and 40 cm width. The depth can be
adjusted to the particle diameter to ensure that the container holds only one vertical
layer of particles. The oriﬁce is formed by the adjustable gap between two aluminum
sliders at the container bottom [34]. A sketch of the setup is shown in Fig. 1. Two
3 cm wide aluminum bars holding the front and back glass plates hide the edges, and
the observable area in the pictures is 34 cm. The bin is much higher than the height
of the observable area. In the present study, the bin is ﬁlled with particles up to a
ﬁlling height of approximately 60 cm before each experimental run, which is slightly
higher than the observable area.

The obstacle is realized by a cylindrical magnet of 25 mm diameter and 3 mm
thickness that is suspended inside the bin.
It is held in place by a second magnet
outside the bin. By this ﬁxation method, we avoid suspension wires inside the silo
but still keep the opportunity to change the obstacle position straightforwardly. The
magnets are set above the center of the oriﬁce. The height is deﬁned as the position
of the center of the cylinder above the oriﬁce, labeled in Fig. 1 by H.

Figure 1(b) details the geometry near the obstacle and the oriﬁce in the silo. D
is the diameter of the circular obstacle, d is the diameter of the spherical particles, W
is the width of the oriﬁce in the silo, H is the height position of the obstacle, viz. the
distance of its center from the oriﬁce level.

The silo discharge is observed by two commercial video cameras, see Fig. 1(a). The
front camera (XiaoYi 4K+ Action) focuses on the bottom area around the obstacle
and captures videos with a frame rate of 120 fps with a spatial resolution of 0.2 mm
per pixel. The second camera (Canon EOS 600D) is placed behind and above the front
one and captures videos with a frame rate of 60 fps to monitor the height changing in
the silo during discharge.

geometry near the obstacle above the oriﬁce. (c) shows the particles, the top ones
are hydrogel spheres (HGS) with 7 mm diameter, below are the airsoft bullets
(ASB) with 6.5 mm diameter. Scale bars are 10 mm.

Commercial hydrogel spheres (HGS) are swelled for at least 24 hours in NaCl
solution. The size of the swollen HGS depends on the salt concentration. We select a
NaCl concentration of 5.0 g/L and obtain HGS with a mean diameter of d = 7 mm,
which varies by approximately 3 %. An elastic modulus of roughly 30 kPa was
determined using the Hertzian contacting model [42] by measuring the diameter of
the contact area under given weights.

In order to compare the diﬀerences of the behavior of soft, frictionless grains to
hard, frictional particles of a similar size and fraction, we have conducted additional
experiments with hard plastic spheres (airsoft bullets, ASB) of d = 6 mm diameter
and a friction coeﬃcient of approximately 0.3. They behave as rigid spheres. The
experimental parameters are listed in Tab. 1 and the geometry is sketched in Fig. 1(b),
where ρ is the ratio of the oriﬁce width to the particle diameter, and ρ(cid:48) is the ratio of
the gap width to the particle diameter.

3. Methods

The optical images are evaluated sequentially to determine particle positions, local
packing fractions, velocities and other dynamic features of the material in the silo, with
particular emphasis on the regions near the outlet and the obstacle. The necessary
evaluation steps are described in detail in the appendix. Data processing starts with
a machine-learning aided identiﬁcation of all particles in the ﬁeld of view and the
determination of their positions. This is done with a MASK R-CNN algorithm as
described in Appendix A.1. From the tracking of individual particles in successive
images, their velocities are derived to construct a velocity ﬁeld in the container
(Appendix A.2). An interesting quantity, in particular for egress dynamics, is the
escape time from a certain starting position in the silo, which is derived from particle
tracking as described in Appendix A.3. The positions of individual grains are averaged
over a certain number of frames to obtain an average packing local fraction (Appendix
A.4). The kinetic stress can be determined from velocity ﬂuctuations as described in
Appendix A.5. The term of kinetic stress in DEM models [43, 44] is analogous to the
pressure on particles induced by ﬂuctuations. It results from the correlation between
the local packing fraction, which can be considered as degree of deformation, and
ﬂuctuations of the velocity.

4. Results

Figure 2 shows typical trajectories of 12 selected particles. White markers correspond
to the initial positions of these particles. The colored lines are their paths towards the
outlet of the silo. Small arrows of corresponding color along the trajectories symbolize
the instant velocities.

Before the structure and dynamics of the ﬂow ﬁeld inside the silo is analyzed
in detail, the main consequences of an obstacle on the global outﬂow dynamics are
shown in Fig. 3. It compares the mass discharge rates of silos with two diﬀerent oriﬁce
widths W and diﬀerent obstacle positions. All silos started with approximately the
same initial mass of about 1.5 kg (60 cm ﬁll height). For each obstacle geometry,
several independent runs are shown. During the initial phase of the discharge, there

is only little diﬀerence between the individual runs for identical obstacle and oriﬁce
geometries, but it is clearly seen that the placement of an obstacle in front of the
outlet has signiﬁcant consequences when it is placed closer to the outlet. In fact, the
observed scenarios are remarkable. There are, in principle, two eﬀects that one has to
consider: First, when the gap width ρ(cid:48) becomes small enough, it forms a bottleneck
for the discharge. Second, for the soft grains, a lower pressure near the outlet retards
the discharge and leads to clogging at the outlet [34]. When the obstacle is close
enough, directly above the opening, the pressure below is reduced and the particle
behave more rigidly, thus discharging more slowly and clogging even when the outlet
is larger enough for a complete discharge without obstacle. The silo does not empty
completely anymore. This is indicated in Fig. 3 by the diﬀerent plateau levels reached
in the graphs. They indicate that material remains in the silo and congestions form.
100 g of material correspond to an average ﬁll height of 4 cm. Note that we did not

prove whether these plateaus are permanent congestions or whether they dissolve on
a time scale of several minutes, the experiments were stopped after clogs lasted for
more than 30 seconds.

It is even more interesting to compare the diﬀerent situations and to have a more
quantitative view. This reveals that there are two diﬀerent scenarios depending on
the obstacle position. At the lowest position, where ρ(cid:48) is of the order of one (gap
width comparable to, and even lower than the original particle diameter), the outﬂow
still proceeds as long as the ﬁll level is suﬃciently high. The pressure squeezes the
particles through the gaps even when ρ(cid:48) < 1. This is remarkable because when ρ
is well below 2 in a silo without obstacle and oriﬁce at the bottom, clogging would
set in much earlier. Obviously, the soft grains are less prone to clogging when the
bottleneck is not horizontal. In presence of the obstacle near the outlet, when the
silo is partially emptied and the pressure at the bottom drops, the particles clog at
these lateral gaps, the area below the oriﬁce is then free of material (see Fig. 4 (a,b)).
When the obstacle is placed further away from the outlet, and ρ(cid:48) is comparable to
or larger than ρ, this does not happen, but we ﬁnd the second clogging mechanism
mentioned above (Fig. 4(c)). It can be seen from the nearly spherical appearance of
the HGS below the obstacle that they are exposed to small forces only, in contrast to
the particles at both sides.

4.1. Velocity

Figures 5(a,b) show the velocity distribution for the soft HGS in the region near oriﬁces
of diﬀerent widths, with the obstacle at a ﬁxed height of H = 37.5 mm (ρ(cid:48) ≈ 3.75 d).
For comparison, Fig. 5(c) shows the velocity distribution of an ensemble of hard ASB,
albeit with a much wider oriﬁce width. There, one can observe distinct triangular
areas at both bottom corners, where the hard frictional ASB particles hardly move.
These are the edges of stagnant zones. Immediately above the obstacle, particles slow
down and almost come to rest.

It is not possible to directly compare the hard and soft sphere experiments because
of the quite diﬀerent oriﬁce sizes. When the hard grains are observed with smaller
outlet widths, there is no continuous ﬂow because of frequent clogging, and when
the soft grains are observed with larger oriﬁce sizes, the packing fraction is no longer
homogeneous. Empty holes are formed that propagate upwards while the particles are
in free fall in these regions. The reason for the soft grains moving much slower next to
the obstacle than the hard spheres is the smaller oriﬁce width that forms a bottleneck
for the outﬂow. Since the oriﬁce width W is much larger for the ASB, this bottleneck
eﬀect is much less dramatic there.

Figure 6 shows the velocity distribution in the silo with W = 2d = 14 mm and an
obstacle at diﬀerent heights above the oriﬁce. Compared with the case of no obstacle
shown in Fig. 6(d), the velocities near the oriﬁce are systematically lower when an
obstacle is present. When the obstacle height reaches 37.5 mm (Fig. 6(c), ρ(cid:48) = 3.7)
or more, the velocity directly above the oriﬁce has practically reached the same value
as in absence of obstacles. However, a diﬀerence in the ﬂow ﬁeld pattern can be still
observed. With the obstacle, the ﬂow proﬁle is broadened and extends more towards
the side walls, which is intuitively clear.

Figure 7 presents the velocity map in the silo with W = 21 mm oriﬁce width
(W = 3d) and the obstacle at diﬀerent heights. In general, with the wider oriﬁce (by
one particle diameter with respect to Fig. 6), particles can ﬂow out more smoothly
and the velocity maximum increases. Even at the lowest obstacle height of 17.5 mm,
the outﬂow through the larger oriﬁce is faster because of the slightly larger gap width
ρ(cid:48) (Figs. 6(a),7(a)).

The mean vertical velocity of particles leaving the container is plotted in Fig. 8.
This graph demonstrates that within the experimental reproducibility, there is
practically no diﬀerence in the outﬂow velocity when the obstacle is in the highest
position (ρ(cid:48) ≈ 3.7) above the outlet. For lower positions of the obstacle, the outﬂow
velocity of the soft grains is aﬀected signiﬁcantly. This is particularly interesting for
obstacle height 27.5 mm where the width of each of the two gaps is still larger than
the outlet at the bottom. The primary cause for the reduced outﬂow velocity is a
lower pressure on the spheres.

4.2. Escape time

The spatial distribution of escape times is of particular importance in human egress
dynamics [45], but it can also be a decisive parameter in silo discharge. Averaged
escape times of particles in a given starting position are presented in Fig. 9 for diﬀerent
oriﬁce widths and materials at a ﬁxed obstacle position. Note that the selected regions
do not show the full silo width but only approximately one half of it. In Fig. 9(c),
the two bottom corners indicate the transition to the stagnant zones of hard particles.

W = 35 mm. Escape times were averaged over the period where the silo emptied
from half to quarter ﬁlling. The color bars give time in seconds.

In all cases, the escape times of particles starting behind the obstacle are clearly
retarded with respect to particles at the same height that start above the edges of the

obstacle. This is intuitively clear. One notes, however, that this retardation is much
more pronounced for the hard grains (Fig. 9(c)) than for the HGS. Figures 10 and
11 visualize the inﬂuence of the obstacle position. Compared to the situation without
obstacle shown in subﬁgures (d), the obstacle in the highest position (c) supports
a somewhat faster escape of the particles at the two sides, by blocking the central
downﬂow. It thus leads to smaller escape time gradients along the width of the silo.
One can speculate that this eﬀect of smoothing out the distribution of the escape
times by a distant obstacle could be beneﬁcial for the escape dynamics of the animate
objects: Even if the average escape time does not decrease in presence of the obstacle,
there are no particular “danger zones” from where they would not have a chance to
escape in time, even if their initial distance to the exit is similar to the others. Placing
the obstacle closer to the outlet leads to an overall increase of the escape time, note
the diﬀerent color scales in Figures 10 and 11 (a), (b), and (c).

Figure 10. Distribution of escape times of HGS in the silo of W = 14 mm oriﬁce
width with an obstacle at heights of (a) H = 17.5 mm, (b) 27.5 mm, and (c)
37.5 mm. (d) shows the escape times when the obstacle is absent. The escape
times are averaged over the period where the silo was emptied from one half to
one quarter. The color bar gives the time in seconds.

4.3. Local packing fraction

Local packing fractions are shown in Fig. 12 for a ﬁxed obstacle height of 37.5 mm.
In all these plots, the packing fraction appears to be reduced in the ﬁrst bottom
layer. This is an artifact of the evaluation method. Indeed, the packing fraction at
the borders decreases continuously towards the walls because the ﬁrst layer leaves
gaps at the bottom wall. Figure 13 shows this in detail. Our Voronoi evaluation
method averages the packing fractions over roughly one particle size. Because the soft
spheres can be deformed to a more or less hexagonal cross-section in the cell plane,

hard spheres in Fig. 12, it becomes evident that the packing immediately behind the
obstacle (towards the opening), hard particles are less eﬃciently packed while for the
soft spheres, only little diﬀerence between the packing fractions in front of and behind
the obstacle (viewed in the direction of ﬂow) is noticeable. Towards the opening of
the silo, a crescent-shaped zone of reduced packing is seen in all images.

Figures 14 and 15 present the local packing fractions in the silos with 14 mm and
21 mm oriﬁce width, respectively. When the obstacle is at a height of H = 37.5 mm,
there is practically no diﬀerence to the packing in absence of an obstacle in the region
immediately above the outlet. When the obstacle is placed at lower heights (b,c),
it inﬂuences the packing fractions immediately above the outlet. Together with the
reduced pressure above the outlet, this leads to the lower discharge rates seen in the
graphs of Fig. 3.

Note that the packing fraction in the whole container increases systematically
when the obstacle is placed very close to the oriﬁce.
In that case, the ﬂow rate
is reduced and there are even intermittent clogged states. During such states, the
packing fraction of the material increases [38], while slow reorganization of the particle
positions leads to a more eﬃciently packed state until the discharge continues, even
when the non-permanent clog lasts for only one or two seconds. In the time average,
the packing fraction is then globally increased by a few percent.

4.4. Kinetic stress

The decrease of the local packing fraction near the outlet, which is enhanced in
presence of the obstacle, leads to the question whether the presence of an obstacle
also induces a reduction in the magnitude of pressure not only at the silo bottom but

also between the particles. This is of particular interest in view of related studies of
pedestrian dynamics, where too high pressure and too strong ﬂuctuations represent
a safety hazard [46]. With the present setup, we are unable to measure the pressure
directly. Qualitatively, we observe a clear pressure reduction below the obstacle: The
particle shapes are rather spherical there, indicating only little or no external stress.
However, a possible increase of pressure near the gaps at the side of the outlet or
even above the obstacle cannot be quantiﬁed unambiguously from our video data.
Previous studies [24, 47–49] put forward the kinetic stress as a meaningful measure of
the transient ”crowd pressure” even in this rather dense ﬂow, which can be directly
extracted from the particle trajectories and packing fractions. Kinetic stress is a

contribution to the stress tensor related to the local averaged ﬂuctuations of velocity
about their mean and the local packing fraction, and it has previously also been
computed for coarse-grained systems [50–52]. The same concept has also been applied
to ﬂow of hard particles before [49, 51], in particular in silo discharge. We will apply
it to the ﬂow of our soft slippery granular material.

The kinetic stress is measured as the product of the local time-averaged velocity
ﬂuctuations and the local time averaged packing fraction, see Appendix A.5. In our
case, ﬂuctuations of the particle velocities can reﬂect collisions between particles
especially near the oriﬁce, but in denser regions, they often result from dynamic

rearrangements in the packing. These may originate at some distance from the actual
particle position. Similar dynamics are observed in crowds [24, 45].

In all cases analysed within this study, the kinetic stress is largest in vicinity of the
oriﬁce. Packing densities are very low here, and velocity ﬂuctuations result from the
actual outﬂow velocities of individual particles, which are aﬀected both by collisions
and by their dynamics upon leaving more densely packed regions. This behaviour is
thus not unexpected, and the magnitude of kinetic stress increases with increasing
discharge rate, i.e. when the obstacle is placed in a higher position at given oriﬁce
size (Figs. 17 and 18), or when the oriﬁce size itself is increased (Fig. 16). The local
packing fraction is lowest there (Fig. 12). Thus, the data primarily reﬂect the large
increase of the second factor in Eq. (A.3), the velocity ﬂuctuations.

A slight diﬀerence between the hard and soft particles is seen immediately below
the obstacle in Fig. 16, where the kinetic stress of soft particles is not as strong as for
the hard grains. Another obvious diﬀerence is the lower kinetic stress in the regions
towards the bottom corners, the stagnant zones, due to the lack of particle motion.
The kinetic stress is lowered for both types of material directly above the obstacle
where the ﬂow is nearly stagnant.

The main inﬂuence of the obstacle is seen in Figs. 17 and 18, which show the
situation for diﬀerent obstacle heights. When the obstacle position is lowered, the
kinetic stress maximum above the oriﬁce splits into two regions in front of the two
gaps between obstacle and the edges of the oriﬁce. The gradient of the kinetic stress
distribution resembles that of the distribution of escape times but is pointing in the
opposite direction. Again, the pronounced low kinetic stress regions of hard grains in
the bottom corners are a consequence of the stagnant zones.

5. Conclusions

The distributions of velocities, escape times, granular packing fractions and kinetic
stress during silo discharge have been analysed in this study. The focus of the
experiments has been laid upon the eﬀects of an obstacle in front of the outlet on
the discharge of elastically deformable grains.

When the obstacle is close enough to the outlet, it reduces the discharge rate
of the particles. This is similar to previous observations of hard particle discharge
from a quasi-2D silo [53]. In contrast to reports on pedestrian evacuation or some

discharge experiments with hard particles, we have not found any conﬁgurations where
clogging was suppressed by the obstacle. In contrast, the obstacle can induce clogging
in geometries when it would not occur in absence of the barrier. Interestingly, two
eﬀects can lead to clogging when the obstacle is present. First, when the gaps between
the obstacle borders and the edges of the oriﬁce become smaller than the oriﬁce width,
clogs can form in both gaps, blocking the outﬂow completely. The peculiarity of this
situation is that when only one of the gaps is blocked, this clog may resolve when the
outﬂow proceeds through the opposite gap. This persistent ﬂow changes the positions
of the particles above the obstacle and may break the balance of the material forming
the clog. Thus, one often ﬁnds long-persistent but non-permanent clogs (lasting
for several seconds, even more than 30 seconds). Since we were not interested in
the distinction of permanent clogs and long-lasting congestion, the experiments were
stopped when a completely clogged state lasted for several seconds. This does not
exclude that some of these clogged states dissolved after a longer period, as a result
of some creeping motion in the silo.

A second scenario was discovered even when the gap between obstacle and outlet
edge was considerably larger than the oriﬁce width W , and the latter being two particle
diameters (ρ = 2). For such a ratio of oriﬁce width and particle diameter, clogs are
not expected in absence of an obstacle [34]. With the obstacle, the soft particles pass
the two lateral gaps without clogging, but clogs are found to occur at the oriﬁce.
The obstacle screens the particles below, at least partially, from the pressure of the
overlying material. This is clearly seen in the images, where the HGS below the
obstacle appear nearly circular while they are squeezed to nearly hexagonal cross
sections in the regions at both sides (see, e.g., Fig. 4(c)). Since it is well known
that the discharge of soft grains through narrow oriﬁces is pressure dependent, it is
intuitively clear that the outﬂow is blocked below a suﬃciently low-positioned obstacle.
For hard grains, where the clogging is not pressure dependent, such an eﬀect can be
excluded.

6. Outlook

This study discussed principal eﬀects of an obstacle on velocities, escape times,
granular packing fractions and kinetic stresses in a quasi-2D silo ﬁlled with soft
spheres. Here, we have focused on the general features and demonstrated, what
consequences can be expected. With respect to the ’faster-is-slower’ eﬀect observed,
e. g., in pedestrian dynamics [31], we have not found any such signs in the soft spheres
system. Rather, the opposite is found. A reduction of the pressure above the oriﬁce
retards the discharge.

Interestingly, one minor eﬀect was observed for the obstacle placed further from
the oriﬁce, viz.
the decrease of the escape time for the regions near the bottom
silo walls and overall smoothing of escape time distribution proﬁle. This could be
potentially beneﬁcial for the problem of the evacuation of living objects by eliminating
the “danger zones” from where timely escape would not be possible.

An increasing discharge rate by properly placed obstacles has been found for hard
particles [17] in special geometries. The reason for this counter-intuitive behavior of
rigid materials is the reduced packing fraction near the oriﬁce below the obstacle.
From our observations, we conclude that a similar eﬀect will not be found with elastic
spheres, because the reduced packing fraction and pressure below the obstacle reduce
the discharge rate in any case. An experimental conﬁrmation with the geometry

The eﬀect of obstacles near a silo outlet on the discharge of soft spheres

21

used in Ref. [17] is yet to be performed. The same applies to a more detailed
characterization of escape times and the so-called faster-is-slower eﬀect [45, 54].

A systematic study of obstacle geometries is in general desirable. One extension
of the present work could be investigations of the ﬂow around obstacles placed far
above the outlet, so that the surrounding ﬂow ﬁeld resembles plug ﬂow. Moreover,
diﬀerent obstacle sizes and obstacle shapes [55] need to be explored.

Appendix A. Data analysis

Appendix A.1. Machine-Learning aided image segmentation

The optimal way to extract the information of the outﬂow dynamics is to perform
an instance segmentation of consecutive images of the particles in silo, i.e. to ﬁnd
the shape the image region occupied by each particle. The positions of particles
(their respective region centroids) can then be tracked in time and assembled into
trajectories, provided that the frame rate is suﬃciently high. Furthermore, the particle
shapes can in principle provide additional information, e.g., on the pressure ﬁeld [56].
For the instance segmentation, the MASK R-CNN artiﬁcial neural network was
employed. This type of network is used in multiple applications where detection
accuracy is required, especially for particles with complex shapes [57, 58]. We have
recently applied MASK R-CNN to track the particle positions and orientations in a 3D
gas of elongated particles [59]. To build the data set, around 30 frames with 300 to 400
particles each were manually annotated. Then, the MASK R-CNN pre-trained on the
MS COCO [60] image data set was trained for around 100 epochs on the augmented
images.

As expected, even with a relatively small set of training data, MASK R-CNN
excels in the detection of both hard particles of round shape and soft particles with
deformed shapes, see Fig. A1. This is due to the relative simplicity of the frames,
where clear borders between the objects are present. The background is clean and the
image contains only a low amount of visual noise.

Appendix A.2. Velocity ﬁelds

After all particles in each frame have been detected by a trained MASK R-CNN
network, we use the Python trackpy package [61] to assign labels to all particles and to
track them. From the trajectories of particles appearing in the image sequences, the

displacement of each particle between successive frames can be determined. The time
interval between the frames is the reciprocal 1/f of the frame rate f . The dynamics
of particle i with velocity (cid:126)vi(t) at position (cid:126)xi(t) is given by the equation of motion

(cid:126)vi(t) =

d(cid:126)xi(t)
dt

(A.1)

In principle, it is always possible to increase the accuracy of velocities of slow particles
with small displacements dxi by evaluating every second or third frame etc.

Appendix A.3. Escape time

The escape time map measures the expected time for a particle initially positioned in
a location (x, y) to reach the outlet. Depending on the presence and positioning of an
obstacle, it provides a direct measure how rapidly the exit is reached. We again restrict
ourselves to the period between half and quarter ﬁlling of the container. All particles
have already been detected and tracked in the previous steps of evaluation. However,
we distinguish 2 types of grains: Those, which reach the outlet in the evaluation period
and those which do not. For the ﬁrst, it is straightforward to build an escape time
map, because their initial position and the time until the particle exits the container
can be directly measured. However, if only these particles would be considered, the
number of particles contributing to an average escape time decreases with increasing
distance to the outlet, increasing the statistical error. Thus, we adapt a two-step
procedure to calculate the full escape time map.

First, we augment the particle trajectories with additional information: For each
point in the trajectory, we add the time until the end of the trajectory, the distance
to the mid-point of the outlet, distance to the endpoint of the trajectory (within
the selected measurement period) and the time until the last point of the trajectory.
Then, we sort out all particles which reach the outlet. Here, the escape time for each
point of the trajectory is immediately known. The other particles, we calculate an

do that, we deﬁne a small range of distances from the oriﬁce and ﬁnd all trajectories
ending within this range. The expected escape time along each of these trajectories
is determined as follows: The end-point (xe, ye) of the trajectory i is determined, and
all previously considered trajectories are searched for a point which comes into close

vicinity of this endpoint. Then, the escape times from those previous trajectories to
the exit are averaged, giving a value te(xe, ye). To obtain the escape time for each
point on trajectory i, we add te to the times until the end of the trajectory for all
points. This procedure is repeated with all trajectories ending in the search range.
Next, the distance range of trajectory endpoints is increased and the procedure is
repeated. In this way, an expected escape time is constructed for all points in the
evaluation area.

Appendix A.4. Local packing fraction

The method of Voronoi diagrams [62,63] has been adopted to quantify the local packing
fraction of soft particles. In our case, after image processing, we have determined the
centers of particles in each frame as shown in Fig. A3(a) as seeds. Voronoi cells are
calculated as shown in Fig. A3(b). Since the depth of the silo is ﬁxed, given by the
diameter d of the particles, the Voronoi cell volume is deﬁned as the area of a Voronoi
cell AV multiplied by the silo depth d. The volume of each particles is πd3/6. Then,
the local 3D packing fraction in the cell is given by

where the second factor represents the variance of the velocity, and U(x) is the local
time-averaged velocity. Time averaging is performed over a period where the ﬂow can
be considered quasi-stationary. Since the ﬁrst factor is constant in time, averaging
over several frames was simply used to minimize the statistical error.
