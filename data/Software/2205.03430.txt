Abstract:

The PADME experiment is designed to search for a hypothetical dark photon 𝐴(cid:48) produced in
positron-electron annihilation using a bunched positron beam at the Beam Test Facility of the INFN
Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati. The expected sensitivity to the 𝐴(cid:48)-photon mixing parameter 𝜖 is
10−3, for 𝐴(cid:48) mass ≤ 23.5 MeV/𝑐2 after collecting ∼ 1013 positrons-on-target.

This paper presents the PADME detector status after commissioning in July 2019. In addition,
the software algorithms employed to reconstruct physics objects, such as photons and charged
particles, and the calibration procedures adopted are illustrated in detail. The results show that the
experimental apparatus reaches the design performance, and is able to identify and measure standard
electromagnetic processes, such as positron bremsstrahlung and electron-positron annihilation into
two photons.

Introduction

A new weakly-coupled 𝑈𝐷(1) hidden symmetry, with its corresponding dark photon, has been
proposed by several extensions of the Standard Model as a possible explanation for the diﬃculty of
detecting dark matter [1]. The Positron Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment (PADME), at
the INFN Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (LNF) in Italy, searches for a possible dark photon 𝐴(cid:48)
produced in the process 𝑒+𝑒− → 𝛾 𝐴(cid:48), where the 𝐴(cid:48) goes undetected [2]. A positron beam with
maximum energy of 550 MeV, produced and accelerated by the LNF LINAC, hits a low-𝑍 target.
The annihilation of a positron with an atomic electron in the target can produce an 𝐴(cid:48) with mass up
to ∼ 23.5 MeV/𝑐2. Under the assumption that the 𝐴(cid:48) escapes detection, due to either being long-
lived or decaying predominantly via invisible modes, the production signature is a single photon
plus missing mass. PADME is the ﬁrst experiment to search for such a signal using this technique
and would also be sensitive to any new particle produced in 𝑒+𝑒− annihilation, including axion like
particles, dark Higgs, etc. This paper describes the apparatus and tools developed to accomplish
this program, and reports the achieved performance during the early commissioning phase.

2 The BTF positron beams

The positron beam for the PADME experiment is provided by the LINAC of the LNF DAΦNE
complex. The LINAC can deliver bunched beams of electrons or positrons with a maximum
repetition rate of 50 Hz which can be sent, via a dedicated beam line, to the experimental halls of
the Beam Test Facility (BTF).

For the PADME physics program, the LINAC must be operated in a dedicated mode and with
a speciﬁc setup of the BTF beam line: a bunch duration of hundreds of ns, and an angular spread of
few mrad. Two types of positron beam are available at the BTF: a primary positron beam, produced
at the LINAC positron converter, or a secondary positron beam produced at a secondary target
installed on the BTF line [3][4].

For primary beams, positrons are generated at the LINAC positron converter located down-
stream of the ﬁrst accelerating sections and then transported to the experimental halls. The bunch
multiplicity can be varied between 104 and 1010 particles/bunch with maximum energy of 550 MeV
and energy spread below 1%.

For secondary beams, a copper target is installed on the BTF transfer line. The interaction
of the primary electrons with the target produces a broad distribution of particles both in energy
and angle. These are then momentum-selected and collimated, to produce a lower intensity beam,
down to a single particle per spill. In this conﬁguration, the maximum energy available for the
positrons in the BTF halls is higher, since all the LINAC accelerating sections are used, increasing
the maximum energy by 220-250 MeV to a total of 770-800 MeV.

To obtain a higher beam energy, thus increasing the explorable 𝐴(cid:48) mass range, a secondary
positron beam of energy 545 MeV was used in the ﬁrst PADME runs of October and November
2018. The sensitivity obtained running with this setup was discovered to be limited by the beam
background in the experiment. Therefore, only primary positron beam was used in the data-taking
runs of 2019 (this paper) and 2020 (runs with improved beam line) [5]. For regulars runs, the

– 2 –

primary beam energy was set at 490 MeV and 432.5 MeV, respectively for the two periods, and not
at 550 MeV, maximum energy, to avoid LINAC instability at top energy.

3 The PADME detector

A sketch of the PADME setup is shown in Fig. 1. This layout is intended primarily to measure
the 4-momentum of the outgoing photons and of the forward-emitted particles after the positrons
interact with the target. Assuming that the target electrons are at rest, the missing mass from
interactions with a single photon in the ﬁnal state can be computed to search for the 𝐴(cid:48).

the
The main component of the PADME setup is a calorimeter consisting of two systems:
Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECal), which gives precise measurements of the energy and impact
point of all photons emitted in the angular range 15-82 mrad with respect to the beam direction,
and the Small-Angle Calorimeter (SAC) which allows photons emitted below ∼15 mrad to be
vetoed. The SAC is most sensitive to background reactions such as bremsstrahlung and 𝑒+𝑒− → 3𝛾
annihilation.

Any positron that does not interact in the target is directed towards a beam monitor and the beam
dump by a magnetic ﬁeld, which also deﬂects secondary charged particles towards a set of dedicated
detectors. These detectors act both as vetoes for background reactions and as spectrometers for
forward emitted particles.

(Right). The positron beam enters from the right. The trajectory of a non-interacting 𝑒+ is drawn
in black, and in black, the trajectories corresponding to a 𝛾𝛾/𝛾 𝐴(cid:48) production in the target. The
particle trajectories from a bremsstrahlung interaction in the target are drawn in red.

3.1 Active diamond target

A thin active diamond sensor not only provides the target for the annihilation process, but also mea-
sures the XY proﬁle of the beam and the beam multiplicity, i.e. the number of positrons contained
in each bunch. To have the highest possible ratio of annihilation cross-section to bremsstrahlung
cross-section, the lowest possible atomic number Z is required. Out of a range of solid materials
considered for the target, diamond (Z = 6) was eventually chosen because of its relatively straight-
forward manufacturing process. The sensor has an active surface of 20×20 mm2 and a thickness
of 100 𝜇m. Graphite strips with pitch 1 mm, including a 0.15 mm gap, were created using a laser
technique on both diamond faces [6]. Nineteen strips on one face were oriented horizontally to

– 3 –

measure the X view and nineteen strips on the other face were oriented vertically to measure the Y
view). Only 16 strips for each views were connected to the electronic readout [7].

3.2 Electromagnetic calorimeter system

The ECal and the SAC were designed to study diﬀerent types of interactions. The main objective
of the ECal is to detect photons produced in 𝑒+𝑒− annihilation. These include photon pairs coming
from 𝑒+𝑒− → 𝛾𝛾 interactions as well as single photons that may be produced along with the 𝐴(cid:48)
bosons (see Sec. 1). The ECal is a high resolution detector composed of 616 scintillating bismuth
germanate (BGO) crystals each of dimensions 21 × 21 × 230 mm3, arranged in a cylindrical shape
and readout by HZC XP1911 photomultipliers. It is placed ∼3.4 m downstream from the target and
the external radius is approximately 29 cm. The resulting angular coverage ranges from 15.66 mrad
to 82.11 mrad. The main component of its scintillation light has a decay time of ∼ 300 ns. Thus, to
avoid pile-up created by the high rate of bremsstrahlung photons which are predominantly emitted
in the forward direction, the ECal was built with a hole of dimension 5×5 crystals (105 × 105 mm2).
The energy resolution of the ECal was evaluated to be 2.62% at 490 MeV [8].

The main purpose of the SAC is to veto photons from 3𝛾 annihilation and bremsstrahlung
(𝑒±𝑁 → 𝑒±𝑁𝛾).
It is placed behind the central hole of the ECal and consists of a matrix of
25 PbF2 crystals, each measuring 30 × 30 × 140 mm3 and coupled to Hamamatsu R13478UV
photomultipliers. The readout signal from PbF2 crystals comes from Cherenkov light scintillation.
The in-bunch bremsstrahlung rate in this detector was expected to reach ∼ 102 MHz, requiring a
double-peak separation better than 5 ns. Typical signals from the SAC are 2 − 3 ns long, matching
the requirement.

A beam test of a single SAC unit was performed at the BTF before the detector was constructed.
A single-particle electron beam with an energy between 100 MeV and 400 MeV was ﬁred onto the
PbF2 crystal, to study energy and time resolution, as well as the linearity of the detector response.
The measured energy resolution was below 20% across the entire energy range, and the time
resolution was 80 ps.

3.3 Charged particle detectors

Three stations of charged particle detectors are placed inside the vacuum chamber of the experiment
[9]. They are all composed of bars of polystyrene plastic scintillator measuring 10 × 10 × 178 mm3,
each equipped with a 1.2 mm2 diameter BCF-92 wavelength shifter ﬁbre (WLS ﬁbre) along a
longitudinal groove. The light from the WLS ﬁbre is detected by a 3 × 3 mm2 Hamamatsu S13360
silicon photomultiplier (SiPM). Four SiPMs are mounted on a custom-designed front-end electronics
card (FEE-card) providing a controllable high voltage. The card also allows independent temperature
and current monitoring for each channel. Vacuum feed-through ﬂanges ensure the communication
and the signal transmission between the FEE-cards and the custom designed controller modules.

Two of the charged particle detector stations, the positron veto (PVeto, 90 scintillator bars) and
the electron veto (EVeto, 96 scintillator bars), are located inside the dipole magnet and are read out
from one side of the plastic scintillators. The high energy positron veto (HEPVeto, 16 scintillator
bars) is placed downstream towards the positron beam exit window. Here the light output is detected
from both ends of each bar.

4 PADME data acquisition

4.1 Trigger and readout

The PADME data acquisition system [10] reads data from a total of 897 channels with an acquisition
rate of 50 Hz, deﬁned by the LINAC operation frequency. All channels are connected to a set of 29
CAEN V1742 [11] switched capacitor ADC boards based on the DRS4 chip consisting of a 1024
cells switched capacitor array (SCA) with a tunable 12-bit sampling rate. The relatively slow signal
produced by the BGO crystals and the target integral signal are sampled at 1 GS/s, while the faster
signals from the charged particle vetoes and the small angle calorimeter are sampled at 2.5 GS/s.
Two CAEN A3818 PCI Express boards collect data from all ADC boards via 8 optical links, each
with a maximum throughput of 80 MB/s.

All ADC boards are interfaced with the main PADME Trigger and Timing System (TTS). The
TTS consists of a main trigger board and two trigger distribution units. The trigger board can
receive up to six NIM-level external triggers (the most important being the BTF trigger from the
LINAC, the cosmic ray trigger for ECal calibration, and the random trigger).

The data acquisition process is organized into two stages: level 0 (L0), which collects data
from the ADC boards, and level 1 (L1), which merges all data into a single event structure and
produces the ﬁnal data ﬁles.

With all sub-detectors enabled, optimal beam conditions, and the zero-suppression algorithm
set to ﬂagging mode (i.e. no data are rejected) the maximum data rate is ∼ 50 MB/s. All data
produced by the PADME DAQ system are written to a local disk buﬀer directly connected to the
L1 servers. The total size of the disk buﬀer is ∼ 38 TB, corresponding to approximately ten days
of continuous data-taking. The resulting RAW ﬁles are then copied asynchronously to the oﬀ-line
storage facilities of the experiment where the reconstruction and analysis of the data are performed.
Fig. 2 shows the PADME DAQ system logical scheme.

Figure 2: Logical scheme of the PADME DAQ system.

4.2 Detector Control System

The PADME Detector Control System (DCS) is a standalone real-time threaded application running
on the DAQ server. It communicates with the diﬀerent hardware controllers and sensors of the
experiment and continuously monitors all relevant parameters. In case of channel current trips ,
the DCS can recover it automatically. To guarantee that the DCS program is running correctly, a
dedicated daemon periodically checks its status and, in the case that it has turned oﬀ, restarts it.

– 5 –

The list of detector parameters to monitor is passed to the DCS via a conﬁgurable text ﬁle that
speciﬁes the IP address where each parameter can be read asynchronously via Ethernet. The DCS
also monitors the beam and ambient parameters.

The DCS continuously sends all collected information, along with respective timestamps, to
the Online Monitor. It also drives the alarm control system and writes all monitored values to the
local DCS database.

4.3 Online Monitor

Diﬀerent monitoring tools have been developed to control the detector operation and to check its
stability during data-taking. The parameters to be controlled fall into two categories: ambient
parameters, and hardware settings and detector responses. The two classes are managed by the
diﬀerent software tools mentioned earlier: the DCS and the DAQ. Both generate data ﬁles that are
displayed via a web-based Online Monitor. The basic architecture of this software is client-server
and the communication is realized with the REST protocol. The graphical characteristics of the
plots and the values are interpreted and graphed using the PlotlyJS library.

This system was used for the entire data collection period of the PADME experiment showing
excellent stability and scalability. The intrinsic scalability of the system was a key factor in allowing
geographically distributed remote shifters to supervise the data acquisition during the 2020 run,
when COVID-related travel restrictions prevented collaborators from being able to travel to LNF to
assist with data-taking.

4.4 Oﬄine computing and data storage

To handle the data transfer from the DAQ system to the ﬁnal storage area, a Central Data Recording
(CDR) software, named PadmeCDR, was developed. PadmeCDR runs on a dedicated server
connected with a 10 Gbps Ethernet link to the LNF Tier2 infrastructure, part of the Worldwide LHC
Computing Grid (WLCG), and automatically transfers the DAQ data to the PADME tape storage
area at the tape library of the INFN CNAF national computing center [12].

The data are also automatically replicated on the local KLOE2 tape library at LNF as a disaster-
recovery safeguard. At the end of the second PADME data taking, a total of ∼ 510 TB of data
had been written to tape. The PADME oﬄine computing environment also includes PadmeProd,
a custom software package that handles the centralized production of simulated events and the
reconstruction of all the data, real and simulated, of the experiment using dedicated WLCG resources
located at LNF and CNAF. The distributed CVMFS ﬁle system [13] was used to create a storage
area at CNAF from which all WLCG sites can access the PADME simulation and reconstruction
software. A Virtual Organization (VO), named vo.padme.org, was created to handle the WLCG
authorization procedures through the Virtual Organization Management System (VOMS) at CNAF.

5 PADME oﬄine software

Data processing and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation use a common software framework. The data
format and persistency mechanisms are based on the ROOT [14] and Geant4 [15] libraries. The
raw event consists of the full set of digital signals recorded by each channel after zero suppression,
along with trigger information (see Sec. 4.1).

– 6 –

The reconstruction software for each detector converts the raw data into collections of recon-
structed hits, after applying decoding procedures based on conﬁguration data to map the electronic
channels into the physical elements of the PADME detector. Reconstructed hits contain information
about position, time and energy, corrected for alignment and calibration constants (as described in
Sec. 6). During reconstruction, hits are processed with a clusterization logic that creates candidate
objects to represent the signature of particles in the detectors.
In the ECal and SAC, these are
electromagnetic clusters from photons, while in the veto detectors they are clusters of neighboring
hits from short tracks of charged particles.

The data from the target are processed diﬀerently. The summary features of the beam proﬁle
are the position of the charge centroid, the width of the distribution in the X and Y view, and the
calibrated number of positrons in the bunch, inferred from the total charge released in the detector.

The output format of simulated events consists of collections of Geant4 hits for each detector,
with position, time, channel identiﬁer and true energy released in the active element of the detector,
and the corresponding collections of digitized information. It contains the detector channel hits
after some processing aiming at emulating the ﬁnite resolution of the detectors and their readout
electronics. The reconstruction software converts the digits into collections of reconstructed hits
using the same format as for real data, by applying further grouping and smearing in order to
best match the detector response. Afterwards, the same clusterization and beam reconstruction
algorithms used for real data are also applied to simulated events.

5.1 Physics processes and detector simulation

The PADME simulation feeds a description of the geometry and materials of the experiment to
Geant4 for the emulation of all particle interactions. This includes, in addition to the active
detectors with their inert support and wrapping materials, the magnet; the vacuum chamber; the
beam pipe, starting from a window (made of beryllium in 2019 and Mylar in 2020) that separates
the PADME line from the upstream accelerator beam line; and the last bending magnet of the
beam before the target. A typical background simulated event consists of approximately 2×104
beam positrons, with the time structure of a typical beam bunch seen by PADME. The simulation
accounts for the main electromagnetic processes occurring in the interactions of beam positrons
in the target at PADME. These processes are bremsstrahlung, two-photon production and Bhabha
scattering. Simulating the beam line enables an accurate reproduction of the main features of the
beam-induced background.

For signal acceptance studies, single interactions corresponding to a speciﬁc process are
generated either by external Monte Carlo generators, in the case of two- and three-photon interactions
and other selected electromagnetic processes, or by an internal generator, for example to simulate
the production of an invisible dark photon in association with a photon. The ﬁnal-state particles
produced by the generator are injected into the PADME simulation in a production vertex within the
target volume and the propagation of one positron of the beam pulse is stopped in the target. The
resulting simulation of the signal interaction is fully overlapped with the pile-up from background
electromagnetic interactions of the other beam particles.

5.2 Single- and multi-hit reconstruction

The front-end signals of all detectors are uniformly sampled inside a readout window, when a trigger
signal is received. This window is 1024 ns long for the target and the ECal, and 409.6 ns long for
the SAC and the vetoes (see Sec. 4.1). The ADC ranges from 0 to 4095 counts with a voltage
range of [-0.5, 0.5] V, for bipolar signals, and [0,1] V, for unipolar signals.

To reduce the amount of processed data, zero-suppression is applied to the vetoes and the ECal,
in which waveforms with standard deviation less than 5 mV are not considered for hit reconstruction.
In all detectors, a pedestal is calculated on an event-by-event basis from the average of the ﬁrst
few hundred sampled values, before the arrival of the trigger (the exact number changes for each
detector), and is then subtracted from each waveform. If a negative polarity signal is obtained, a
sign change is applied to the pedestal-subtracted waveform. Finally, the voltage is converted to
charge in units of pC.

The hits are reconstructed from each ADC waveform using diﬀerent algorithms according to the
detector characteristics. For the BGO crystals in the ECal, overlapping hits in single channels were
observed during commissioning, and therefore a multi-hit reconstruction algorithm was developed
based on a signal template. Hit times and energy deposits are determined by evaluating the
derivative and the integral of the corresponding shifted and scaled templates, respectively. To
obtain the corresponding energy value a nominal conversion factor of 15.3 pC/MeV (corresponding
to 8 photoelectrons per keV and a PMT nominal gain of 1.1×104) is applied. The energy may be
corrected for fractional charge-loss due to the signal tail extending beyond the readout window, and
for signal saturation. An energy threshold of 1 MeV is applied to the ECal hits.

The SAC crystals and the veto scintillating bars can have multiple hits per event. The time of
each hit is therefore determined using a 1D peak ﬁnder algorithm based on the TSpectrum class of
ROOT with a width of 0.8 ns for the SAC and 2.4 ns for the vetoes. Each peak inside a ﬁducial
time window is then associated with a hit, the time of which is given by the peak position. The
SAC hit energy is calculated by integrating the charge over a time interval of 4 ns centered on the
peak and converted to MeV with a nominal conversion factor of 0.1 pC/MeV (corresponding to 2
photoelectrons per MeV and a PMT nominal gain of 3.2×105). The veto hit energy is obtained from
the peak maximum and converted into MeV with a nominal conversion factor of 25 mV/MeV, using
the fact that a minimum-ionizing particle (MIP) crossing a 1 cm scintillator releases approximately
2 MeV of energy.

5.3 Photon and charged particle reconstruction

The identiﬁcation of physics objects, such as photons and charged particles entering a detector, is
performed by clustering the hits which are close in time and in space. Appropriate energy thresholds
and time diﬀerences have been deﬁned for each detector (ECal, SAC, vetos) with MC simulation
studies and prototype tests. For each detector, the clustering algorithm starts from the list of hits not
associated with a previous cluster and with the most energetic hit used as the seed of the new cluster.
For the SAC and the vetoes, hits are not associated with a cluster if there is at least one missing hit
between them and the seed along any direction. The energy of the cluster is given by the sum of
the energies of all participating hits and the time and the position by the energy-weighted time and

– 8 –

position of the hits. A detailed description of the diﬀerent clustering algorithms developed for the
ECal can be found in Ref. [16].

In-situ detector calibrations

The absolute calibration of detector response and its time alignment is a vital step towards the
reconstruction and measurement of physical phenomena. Being an active element, the target also
needs to be calibrated, which is of crucial importance for the determination of the cross section of
any physical process.

A good energy calibration is fundamental for the ECal to precisely deﬁne the missing mass in
dark photon events (of a tenth of MeV), and for the SAC and PVeto to match measured photons with
the correct positron to detect bremsstrahlung processes (of few tenths of MeV). Finally, a good time
calibration (of few ns) between the various sub-detectors is also needed to correctly group particles
coming from the same interaction.

6.1 Target calibration

The diamond target was calibrated by equalizing the response of each ampliﬁer and comparing
the amount of charge collected by diﬀerent strips. Each ampliﬁer is equipped with an internal
charge injection circuit, which allows the front-end to be tested and the gain to be measured. The
charge injected is shared between all the channels selected by an internal shift-register, making
channel-by-channel calibration possible. Calibration factors for each channel were inserted in the
calibration service of the PADME reconstruction software to estimate the charge collected by the
strips (Fig. 3, left).

The collected charge per bunch is one of the most important pieces of information to extract,
because it is expected to be proportional to the bunch multiplicity. An absolute calibration of the
diamond target was performed using dedicated runs with diﬀerent multiplicities of the positron
beam as measured by a monitoring lead-glass Cherenkov calorimeter available at the BTF. At
each calibration step, the beam was sent to the BTF calorimeter by turning oﬀ the last bending
magnet, after which the magnet was turned back on, the beam was sent back to PADME and the
target response was recorded. Several runs at diﬀerent bunch multiplicities were taken in order to
cross-calibrate the target. In Fig. 3, right, the average of the total charge collected by the X and Y
views is shown as a function of the multiplicity measured by the BTF calorimeter. The slope of the
linear ﬁt was used to deﬁne the absolute calibration factor to be used in the analysis software.

6.2 Charged veto calibration

Gain calibration constants of each channel are derived from data and then used to perform oﬄine
corrections of any diﬀerences in the readout hardware of the various detector elements. In the gain
equalization of the charged veto channels is important to apply a uniform threshold and to build
clusters of adjacent hits corresponding to MIPs crossing the detector with an angle, and in the case
of pile-up to distinguish between multiple charged particles crossing.

The relative calibration constants were obtained by evaluating the distribution of the hit energy
for each electronic channel of the vetoes, after setting a very low threshold for the hit reconstruction.
A Gaussian ﬁt around the peak was used to estimate the most probable value of the pulse height

distribution averaged with respect to crossing angle and the impact point of the MIP (Fig. 4, right).
The relative calibration constant for each channel was computed by scaling the most probable pulse
height to 50 mV (Fig. 4, left) and applying a scale factor of 34 MeV/V, to obtain a peak energy of
1.7 MeV. This is the expected energy deposit of a MIP crossing 1.1 cm of plastic scintillator.

coincidence with the SAC (bremsstrahlung positrons).

6.3 Time calibration

The time calibration of the front-end channels of downstream detectors (calorimeters and vetoes)
is necessary to prevent hits from diﬀerent positron interactions being assigned to the same cluster,
which would result in a poor measurement of energy and position.

A strong time correlation exists between adjacent channels of the same detector, because of
electromagnetic showers produced by charged particles crossing more than one scintillating bar
or crystal. A statistically signiﬁcant time correlation between channels of diﬀerent detectors only
exists if they are produced by the same primary interaction. The data show clear time correlations

– 10 –

between each pair of detectors except the EVeto and the SAC. This is probably due to the fact
that the occupancy of the EVeto arises from open-angle primary interactions, such as charged
pair-production and showers. Thus, there are few primary interactions expected to produce signals
in both the EVeto and the SAC. Because of the lack of correlation between these two detectors, this
distribution is not shown in Fig. 5.

The calibration is performed to determine the time oﬀset t𝐷

𝑖+1,𝑖 between channel i and the
adjacent channel i+1 of detector D. Then, the time oﬀset t𝐷
𝑖+1 with respect to reference channel 0
is calculated by summing the relative calibration constants t𝐷
𝑘+1,𝑘 of all previous channels k < i to
align detector D in time. The ﬁnal time alignment is obtained by measuring the global time oﬀset
for each detector using all hit correlations between PVeto - ECal, EVeto - ECal and SAC - PVeto.
Fig. 5, right, shows the time diﬀerences between clusters of diﬀerent detectors after the calibrations
are applied. All distributions have a peak centered at zero (when the physical object comes from the
same interaction) above a triangular uncorrelated background (from pile-up events and uncorrelated
beam background).

Time diﬀerences in detectors have two causes: variation in time-of-ﬂight of particles originating
from the same interaction, and diﬀerent cable lengths or electronics module delays (see Fig. 5). To
distinguish the contributions to time diﬀerences observed in data, the same procedure was applied
to simulated events. This resulted in a second set of time calibration constants reﬂecting only the
diﬀerence in time-of-ﬂight of particles, which was subsequently applied to the reconstruction of
data.

Figure 5: Distributions of time diﬀerences between diﬀerent detector channels after time calibration
during data-taking with approximately 23000 positrons per bunch.

6.4 ECal calibration

Before mounting the calorimeter, all ECal scintillating units (SUs) were calibrated with photons
emitted by a 22Na radioactive source [8]. This was done to determine the charge vs HV curve, to set
the voltage of each unit to produce the same gain. During all the data-taking, the HVs were set to
have a charge output of 15.3 pC/MeV. This value allows signals up to 1 GeV to be fully contained
in the digitizer dynamic range.

– 11 –

To validate the 22Na calibration and assess and improve the channel equalisation, cosmic ray
events were used. During all the data-taking, the cosmic ray trigger (see Sec. 4.1) was used to
check the calorimeter response to MIPs. Fig. 6, left, shows the distribution of the most probable
values from a Landau ﬁt of all SUs charge distributions, resulting from three days of cosmic rays
at a rate of few Hz. The superimposed Gaussian ﬁt shows that the ECal response is uniform within
(10.99 ± 0.48)%. From the same dataset, the detection eﬃciencies of the SUs were evaluated:
88.4% of the units showed an eﬃciency greater than 99.5% [8].

Finally, a special run was performed with a single-positron beam of 490 MeV ﬁred directly onto
the calorimeter. A 5 × 5 cluster around the crystal with the largest energy deposit was considered
and the multi-hit ECal algorithm based on signal template applied. In Fig. 6, right, the obtained
energy spectrum is shown. The various multiplicity peaks are clearly visible up to seven primary
positrons entering the electromagnetic calorimeter, corresponding to a total energy of 3.4 GeV. In
normal running conditions the number of hits per crystal per event does not exceed two.

ﬁtting each SU charge distribution with Landau curves. Right: distribution of ECal 5 × 5 cluster
energies induced by a single-positron beam of 490 MeV energy and reconstructed with the ECal
multi-hit algorithm.

6.5 SAC calibration

The SAC is a Cherenkov-based detector, and therefore its calibration cannot be performed with
the same tools used to calibrate ECal crystals. The main diﬀerence between the two detectors is
in the light output: the light-yield of PbF2 is only ∼ 2 photo-electrons/MeV, compared to ∼ 200
photo-electrons/MeV for BGO. Hence, the calibration of the SAC was carried out using the BTF
positron beam and cosmic rays.

A ﬁrst set of calibration constants was obtained using beams of single positrons. By modifying
the magnetic ﬁelds of the BTF beam line magnets, a 545 MeV single-positron beam was steered to
strike the crystals of the SAC. Since the dimensions of the SAC are larger than the ECal hole, only
9 out of 25 crystals were reachable by the beam.

In previous test beams, performed on single PbF2 units before detector assembly, the number
of photo-electrons and the photomultiplier gain [17] were found to be 𝑁 𝑝.𝑒. ∼ 2 and 𝐺𝑖 ∼ 3.2×105,

In data, the collected charge was evaluated with a Gaussian ﬁt of the signals. Combining this
information with the parameters found during the test beams, a set of calibration constants was
obtained.

A second set of calibration constants was determined using cosmic rays. The energy released
in PbF2 by MIPs is 9.373 MeV/cm [18]. Since the short side of a SAC unit is 3 cm long, the energy
released by a cosmic ray crossing a crystal perpendicularly is approximately 28.11 MeV. Only
vertical cosmic rays crossing all 5 crystals in a column were considered in this analysis. Charge
distributions for each crystal were ﬁtted with a Landau curve, and the MPVs from the ﬁt were used
to calculate a second set of calibration constants.

The two sets of calibration constants are plotted in Fig. 7, left. The results of the two independent
measurements are compatible within errors. From this work, it was also seen that one of the central
crystals (n. 12) was less eﬃcient than the others. The reason was identiﬁed in a bad optical contact
and was corrected before the data taking of 2020, which is not used for the work presented in this
paper. In Fig. 7, right, the cluster energy for the 9 central crystals is shown before and after the
calibration. After calibration, the position of the signal peak is shifted towards the energy of the
beam (545 MeV) and the energy resolution improves from 11% to 6.7% [19].

(orange) and from cosmic ray measurements (blue). Right: SAC cluster energy distribution of a
545 MeV single-positron beam, before and after calibration.

6.6 Momentum calibration

Thanks to the detailed map of the magnetic ﬁeld, the veto calibration curve of momentum vs
position can be reliably extracted from simulations. From 50 mono-energetic simulated samples of
single positrons, the distribution of cluster z-positions is determined and the momentum calibration
curve and resolution are extracted from the average and width of the Gaussian ﬁts. Fig. 8 shows the
calibration points obtained from the simulations with the following curve ﬁt superimposed:

been mapped precisely in 3D by a dedicated survey, and the excitation curve was also measured in
a subset of points. Since the real magnetic ﬁeld map is used in the simulations, the ﬁt parameters
𝑧0 and 𝐵 of the above simple analytical model, which is exact only for an ideal magnetic ﬁeld 𝐵
constant for 𝑧 > −𝑧0, provide an eﬀective length and a ﬁeld that reproduce the calibration data
points well.

7 Commissioning with primary positron beam

The data collected in July 2019 with a primary positron beam represented the completion of the
commissioning of the experiment. Two-photon annihilation processes were clearly visible in the
ECal, in addition to the bremsstrahlung processes in the plot correlating PVeto and SAC signals.
However, bremsstrahlung events in which the photon goes into the ECal instead of the SAC were
only visible in the 2020 data taking with primary beam and the new beam line.

In 2019, a primary positron beam of energy 490 MeV and bunch length of 150 ns was used.
It was focused to a spot of approximately 2-3 mm in X and Y directions on the target, as can be
seen in Fig. 9 showing the measured beam proﬁles. The typical positron multiplicity was ∼23,000
positrons/bunch (see Fig. 10), corresponding to a density of approximately 150 𝑒+/ns. This was
slightly above the limit imposed by the maximum acceptable event pile-up, which was ascertained
to be ∼100 𝑒+/ns, after a careful analysis performed during beam commissioning for 2020 data
taking.

Thanks to a remote controlled positioning motor, the target can be moved to the “parked"
position where it does not interact with the beam. Runs without target were used to study the beam
background arising from beam interactions with diﬀerent materials (seen by the PADME detectors).
During the commissioning phase the comparison of data with and without target was a powerful
tool to investigate the origin of the observed background. The two datasets with and without target
consist of 400,000 events each.

diamond target during the July 2019 data-taking. Beam energy and the total number of particles
are indicated.

7.1 Detector occupancy

With the beam parameters previously mentioned, the distribution of the number of clusters for each
detector is shown in Fig. 10. The number of positrons striking the PVeto is relatively high, while the
number of electrons striking the EVeto is very small. The rate of the photons in the two calorimeters
are very diﬀerent, with ECal registering a much lower rate than SAC, as expected from the hole in
the centre of the ECal. The ECal photon ﬂux is dominated by beam background, while the SAC
photon ﬂux is mostly due to positron bremsstrahlung in the target.

To better understand the occupancy of the detectors, in Fig. 11 the distributions of the cluster
sizes are shown. The ECal cluster size is quite large, but a 5x5 matrix is adequate for the clus-
terization algorithm. The average cluster size in the PVeto is similar to the EVeto but larger than
that of the HEPVeto. This reﬂects the position and angular orientation of the experiment, since the
HEPVeto can only be struck by positrons that are almost orthogonal to the detector surface.

Figure 10: Left: distribution of the positron bunch multiplicity as measured by the active diamond
target. Right: distribution of the number of clusters for the diﬀerent detectors. The data correspond
to a beam bunch multiplicity of approximately 23,000 positrons per bunch.

– 15 –

data-taking with approximately 23,000 positrons per bunch.

7.2 Photon spectra in the ECal

The energy distribution of the clusters reconstructed in the ECal has been studied and compared
with simulation (see Fig. 12). To evaluate the beam-induced background, the spectrum measured
in no-target runs is also shown. The comparison with the simulation shows good agreement for
energies above 30 MeV while the low energy region is dominated by a background component that
is also observed in the data collected without target. The source for this background is the large
number of low-energy photons produced by unwanted interactions of the beam with beamline and
detector materials, a phenomenon that was not predicted during the experimental design.

The most important reference process for PADME is the annihilation of a positron with an
electron in the target producing a pair of photons. The high rate of bremsstrahlung photons in the
forward direction and the coarse granularity of the SAC prevent a clear identiﬁcation of this process
in this detector. Therefore the search for 𝑒+𝑒− → 𝛾𝛾 annihilation is performed using only the
ECal detector, where the bremsstrahlung background is quite suppressed with respect to the SAC.
The search exploits the two-photon time coincidence and the conservation of momentum in the
transverse plane. A simple event selection is implemented by applying the following requirements,
without any attempt to optimize the acceptance or the ratio of signal yield to background:

• Two ECal clusters in time coincidence Δ𝑡 =| 𝑡𝐶𝑙1 − 𝑡𝐶𝑙2 |< 3 ns;

• The energy-weighted position of the di-photon pair compatible with the beam direction:

| 𝐶𝑜𝐺 𝑥 |< 1 cm and | 𝐶𝑜𝐺 𝑦 |< 1 cm 1;

The distribution of the sum of the energies of the clusters that satisfy the above requirements is
shown in Fig. 12. The data show a well deﬁned peak at the beam energy, which is indicative
of the annihilation process. The data also seem well modeled by the simulation. The same
distribution obtained for a run without the target is superimposed. As expected in this distribution,
the annihilation peak is not present because annihilation can only occur in the target. Furthermore,
the smooth two-photon shoulder matches the shape of this distribution well, indicating that it is

infrastructure and other materials.

coincidence with clean-up cuts as explained in the text (right). The data of a standard run with
target (black points) are compared to data of a dedicated run without target (blue points) and to
simulation with the 2019 beam line (red line). The distributions are normalized to the same number
of POT equalizing the distribution of out-of-time photons. The data and simulation correspond to
a beam bunch multiplicity of ∼23,000 positrons per bunch.

7.3 Charged particle spectra

Charged particles coming from the interaction region with energy less than the beam energy are
bent towards the three veto detectors. In Fig. 13 the particle proﬁles are shown as a function of
scintillating bar number for a beam of approximately 23,000 e+/bunch, with and without target. The
normalization of the run without target is obtained by imposing the same occupancy of the ﬁrst ten
scintillator bars of PVeto, where no contributions from interactions in the target are expected. The
source of this low-energy charged particle background was removed before 2020 data taking with
a more focused beam and larger beam-transport pipes.

For PVeto bars with high channel numbers (those furthest from the target), the rate is very
high and the detector is not able to provide precise information. Here, the high pile-up probability
and the large cluster size due to the angle of incidence of the particles on the detector generate
many hits in the same bars that cannot be separated in time. In this region the hits are dominated
by bremsstrahlung interactions in the target and by primary positrons that have slightly less energy
than the beam core and that are bent at a larger angle. This beam energy spread is mainly caused by
the energy degradation of a small fraction of positrons undergoing bremsstrahlung interactions in
the beryllium window separating the LINAC and the PADME vacuum. This eﬀect was signiﬁcantly
reduced with the new beam line installed in 2020.

The diﬀerence in rate with and without the target in the intermediate scintillating bars, approx-
imately between numbers 10 and 70, is due to the contribution of hard bremsstrahlung interactions
in the target [20]. This corresponds to the momentum range between 50 MeV and 280 MeV, as seen
in Fig. 13.

– 17 –

Figure 13: Left: charged particle proﬁles for positron, high energy positron and electron vetos
with and without target. Right: corresponding momentum distributions with target data for all
vetoes and with no-target data subtracted for PVeto and HEPVeto. The data correspond to a beam
multiplicity of ∼23,000 positrons per bunch.

The HEPVeto detector acceptance partially overlaps that of the last bars of the PVeto. Thus,
the HEPVeto extends the positron veto acceptance by overlapping the region of low eﬃciency of the
PVeto. The HEPVeto rates with and without target have a diﬀerent shape for the ﬁrst scintillating
bars, and a more similar shape in the last bars. This provides a measurement of the real positron ﬂux
on the PVeto scintillator bars with high numbers. The HEPVeto orientation is almost orthogonal
to the positrons, and HEPVeto clusters typically contain relatively few hits, avoiding the saturation
occurring in the PVeto. Consequently, the diﬀerence in rates of the HEPVeto with and without
target are an estimate of the number of positrons interacting in the target.

As expected, the EVeto rates are much lower than that of the PVeto since electrons must be
created either by rather rare primary interactions or in electromagnetic cascades. In addition, the
EVeto occupancy is similar with and without target, an indication that it is dominated by beam
background interactions.

The momentum calibration curves from Fig. 8 can be used to convert the distribution of the
charged particles’ position along the veto detectors into positron and electron momentum spectra
as shown in Fig. 13. Importantly, the momentum is only accurate for forward particles emerging
from the target with low transverse momentum.
In the same plot the diﬀerence between target
and no-target spectra is shown for PVeto and HEPVeto, where it is possible to estimate the rate of
positron bremsstrahlung from the target in the range from 50 MeV to 290 MeV, for the PVeto, and
from 350 MeV to 390 MeV, for the HEPVeto. This is important since it enables the calibration of
the experimental luminosity with another physical process in addition to two-photon annihilation.
The PVeto has a cutoﬀ energy below 50 MeV and excessive occupancy above 290 MeV, while the
HEPVeto only begins to saturate above 390 MeV.

7.4 Photon and charged particle correlation

The full detection of positron bremsstrahlung processes occurring in the target (𝑒+𝑍 → 𝑒+𝛾𝑍) is
relevant to perform high statistics studies of the correlation between photons and charged particles,
which can be used to set the SAC energy scale and to measure photon detection eﬃciency. Fig. 14

– 18 –

shows scatter plots of the sum of photon energy and positron energy with respect to positron energy
in a time coincidence window of 1 ns. In the PVeto scatter plot the positron bremsstrahlung signal
is clearly visible. This is more diﬃcult to observe in the HEPVeto because of the lower relative
energy resolution of the SAC for low energy photons, and to the high beam background ﬂux.

Figure 14: Left (right) Scatter plot of the sum of the SAC photon and PVeto (HEPVeto) positron
energies against PVeto positron energy evaluated in 1 ns time-coincidence and for SAC photon
energy above 100 MeV (50 MeV). The data correspond to a beam multiplicity of ∼ 23,000 positrons
per bunch.

8 Conclusions

PADME is the ﬁrst ﬁxed-target experiment searching for a dark photon signal by computing the
missing mass of single-photon ﬁnal states resulting from the annihilation of a pulsed positron beam
with the electrons of a ﬁxed target. The collaboration collected several months’ worth of data
during 2018 and 2019 with stable secondary and primary positron beams (Run I), which have been
analyzed to assess the experimental performance and the beam-induced background level. Thanks
to the detailed analysis performed on this ﬁrst dataset, a long and stable data-taking period with
primary beam and a new beam line was performed in 2020 (Run II). These Run II data have lower
beam related background and they are now being studied to produce the ﬁrst physics results and to
establish ﬁnal detector performances.

In this paper we presented an analysis of the data collected in July 2019 for commissioning the
old beam line with a primary beam, and discussed the calibration procedures and the experimental
status. Several detector characteristics have been measured, such as acceptance and energy and time
resolutions. In addition, the simulation software tools, physics object reconstruction algorithms,
detector calibration methods and data quality strategy have all been extensively documented.

The active diamond target has operated continuously and stably in vacuum since September
2018. It fulﬁlls its design goals of providing the beam position resolution with better than 1 mm
precision for 20,000 positrons/bunch and to measure the integrated luminosity at the level of a few
percent after cross-calibration with an external electromagnetic calorimeter.

The electromagnetic calorimeter, which is made of BGO crystals, has excellent energy reso-
lution and an acceptance better than 99.7% for a 10 MeV mass dark photon signal. In Run II a

– 19 –

temperature-dependent single-crystal energy calibration was implemented to improve and stabilize
the energy resolution for long periods data-taking.

The charged particle scintillating bars attained high eﬃciency in the detection of MIPs, very
good time resolution and good double-hit separation capability. This level of performance was
reached thanks to fast front-end electronics, channel gain equalization, and a full multi-hit recon-
struction algorithm.

Finally, with a multi-hit reconstruction algorithm for the Small-Angle Calorimeter, the PbF2
crystals proved to be eﬃcient for the expected high photon ﬂux. In fact, each crystal was capable
of detecting several tens of photons inside a positron bunch of 150 ns length.

The two-photon annihilation process is clearly visible in data collected with the primary positron
beam in the high resolution electromagnetic calorimeter after loose time and angular selections.
This is the standard candle for the PADME detector from which it is possible to demonstrate the
spatial uniformity of the detector and its stable response over time. The bremsstrahlung signal
can be seen in both datasets collected with primary and secondary positron beams after accurate
time-alignment of the electromagnetic calorimeter and the positively charged particle veto.

The beam background observed in the data is caused by electromagnetic showers induced by
beam halo positrons striking the beam pipe or the ﬁnite apertures of the magnet. These particle
splashes produce lower energy charged particles and photons with large angular spread in the
PADME detectors. Another important contribution to beam background comes from positrons
radiating a photon of several MeV while crossing the vacuum-separator beryllium window. To
handle this background it is necessary to develop eﬃcient multi-hit reconstruction algorithms for
all detectors and to perform good time calibrations.

The commissioning process was crucial to prove that the detector design goals have been
reached, to optimize the hardware and software tools, and to achieve good agreement between
simulation and data both for physics signals, such as bremsstrahlung and two-photon annihilation,
and for beam-induced backgrounds. This activity was necessary to address the construction of the
new beam line and to establish the position of the new Mylar vacuum separation window for Run
II, replacing the beryllim window used in Run I.
