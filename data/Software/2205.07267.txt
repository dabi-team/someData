The Cavendish Computors: The women working
in scientiﬁc computing for Radio Astronomy

Verity Allan

Abstract A discussion of the history of scientiﬁc computing for Radio Astronomy
in the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge in the decades after the
Second World War. This covers the development of the aperture synthesis technique
for Radio Astronomy and how that required using the new computing technology
developed by the University’s Mathematical Laboratory: the EDSAC, EDSAC 2
and Titan computers. This article looks at the scientiﬁc advances made by the Radio
Astronomy group, particularly the assembling of evidence which contradicted the
Steady State hypothesis. It also examines the software advances that allowed bigger
telescopes to be built: the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the degridding algo-
rithm. Throughout, the contribution of women is uncovered, from the diagrams they
drew for scientiﬁc publications, through programming and operating computers, to
writing scientiﬁc papers.

1 Introduction

The years following the Second World War were a time of massive scientiﬁc and
technological innovation in the University of Cambridge. The University’s Mathe-
matical Laboratory was set up prior to the War to investigate numerical methods,
and after the war, Maurice Wilkes became its director. Having visited the United
States and seen the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) com-
puter, he started building EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calcula-
tor), putting Cambridge at the forefront of the computer revolution [Ahmed(2013),
p. 41]. In the same post-War years, the Cavendish Radio Astronomy group assem-
bled, with Martin Ryle at its head. The Cavendish Laboratory of the University
of Cambridge had been doing fundamental physics research for decades, and staff

had won Nobel Prizes [Cavendish Laboratory(2021, Cited 30 Sep 2021)]. The Ra-
dio Astronomy group would add to this collection, as Ryle and Tony Hewish won
the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974 for their innovative telescope design and the
discovery of pulsars — work that relied on the computers of the Mathematical Lab-
oratory [Nobel Media AB(1974 Apr 7 [cited 2021 Apr 7])].

This reliance on computers is exempliﬁed by Ryle’s request for a bigger com-

puter:

One day, Ryle came to me to say that he was planning the erection of a much larger telescope
and to ask whether the Mathematical Laboratory could undertake to provide the computing
support required. [Wilkes(1985), p. 193]

This paper will explain why Radio Astronomy needed a bigger computer, and
will elucidate the role of other members of the Radio Astronomy group and the
Mathematical Laboratory beyond the relatively well-known names of Ryle, Hewish,
and Wilkes.

It has become more widely known in recent years that a lot of early computing
relied on women — thanks to work by Janet Abbate and Mar Hicks and Margo Lee
Shetterly [Abbate(2012)], [Hicks(2018)], [Shetterly(2016)]. Women were clearly
involved in the early years of computing at Cambridge, as can be seen from the
archives of the Department of Computer Science and Technology, which is a suc-
cessor to the Mathematical Laboratory. A photograph of staff from 1949 shows 20
staff, of whom 8 were women [Computer Laboratory(1999)]. In this paper, we will
uncover some of the contributions of women to science and scientiﬁc programming
in Radio Astronomy in the years from 1950 to 1963.

The University computers that the Radio Astronomy group used during this
period were EDSAC, the ﬁrst electronic digital stored program computer in the
world, EDSAC 2, which led to many innovations in microprogramming, and Ti-
tan, which led to advances in computer graphics and computer aided design (CAD)
[Ahmed(2013), p. 72]. Titan was the computer requested by Ryle, which was needed
for the One-Mile telescope.

2 The Women In Radio Astronomy Computing

The Radio Astronomy group became reliant on computing, and by 1965, over
40% of all papers produced by the group had required the use of a computer
to process data [Leedham and Allan(2021), p. 14]. Women were extensively in-
volved in this endeavour. Around 50% of people acknowledged in papers for
their contribution to the programming and operation of computers were women
[Leedham and Allan(2021), p. 14]. These women were employed in a variety of
roles.

Some were hired as Computors in the 1950s and 1960s,1 initially to do calcula-
tions, and then later to assist with programming. Computor or Computer as a job

description was common in the 1940s, ﬁrst to describe someone who was hired to
do calculations by hand or with a mechanical or electro-mechanical computer, and
then to describe a worker who used a computer in some capacity [Light(1999)].
The Cavendish records also show that people (often women) were hired as scan-
ners for High Energy Physics: their job was to analyse photographic plates from
cloud chamber experiments. Women were also hired as Research Assistants: Eliz-
abeth Waldram was hired as such [Ahmed(2013), p. 63]. Judy Bailey, who later
became Deputy Director of the University Computing Service (another successor to
the Mathematical Laboratory) worked for Radio Astronomy as a Technical Ofﬁcer
[University of Cambridge(2008 [cited 2021 Apr 7])].

Women were also hired to prepare diagrams for scientiﬁc papers, drawing graphs
and contour diagrams, as it was not yet possible to prepare these with computers.
While preparing this paper, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible
for me to look at University records to get a sense of the number of people in these
roles, nor of how many of them were women. They were known as the girls in the
attic [Clifford, F. E.(1964)], p. viii.

Some of the women involved in scientiﬁc computing were PhD students and
researchers themselves. Ann Neville, one of Ryle’s PhD students, did a considerable
amount of programming. She had to program for EDSAC 2, and to save space, many
constants had to be combined into one constant, just to shave a few bytes off the size
of the program.2

3 The ﬁrst forays into scientiﬁc computing

While Charles Wynn-Williams was a pioneer of electro-mechanical computing for
the Cavendish [Wynn-Williams(1931)], the Radio Astronomy group did not leap
straight to digital computing for all their papers. We can trace the use of comput-
ers and the contributions of programmers primarily through the acknowledgements
section of papers. They published their ﬁrst paper using EDSAC in 1953, and use
through the 1950s was fairly sporadic [Leedham and Allan(2021), p. 14].

The ﬁrst women we encounter in the acknowledgements probably were the com-
puters. In 1951, a Mrs A. C. Hollis-Hallett is credited as having analysed a large
proportion of the records [Smith(1951), p. 963]. It’s not possible to verify this, as no
records survive. Similarly, a Mrs Moore is credited in a paper by Scheuer and Ryle
from 1953, for help in the computation of results [Scheuer and Ryle(1953), p. 17].
It’s likely that Mrs Moore was the computer, not EDSAC, as EDSAC was not listed
in the acknowledgements (which was the common practice at the time).

However, the development of a new technique in Radio Astronomy was going to
change the group’s relationship with computers: the technique of aperture synthesis.
The basic principles were sketched out by Ryle in a 1957 paper [Ryle(1957)], and
implemented by John Blythe. Aperture synthesis, as the name suggests, allows for

the synthesis of a larger aperture. By using two or more smaller telescopes, one can
achieve the resolution (but not the sensitivity) of a telescope with diameter equiva-
lent to the longest spacing between antennas.3 However, when measuring a signal
with a particular pair of antennas, only part of the signal is observed – the measure-
ment is of a Fourier component of the signal [Christiansen and H¨ogbom(1985)],
Chapter 8. To reconstruct the complete signal, the other Fourier components must
be measured, which can be achieved by moving the antennas around to ﬁll in the
aperture. The Fourier components then need to be combined and transformed into a
useful measurement of sky brightness.

Thus the Fourier Transform must be calculated for aperture synthesis telescopes,
and this is not really feasible to do by hand. So the Radio Astronomy group
was forced to turn to computers. Blythe’s papers from 1957, where he imple-
mented this technique, used EDSAC for the calculations [Blythe(1957a), p. 651],
[Blythe(1957b), p. 659]. One of these papers used EDSAC to perform 15 hours of
computation, performing over 2 million operations, to output data in a form suit-
able for making contour maps [Blythe(1957a)]. In both papers, Blythe credited a
Mrs J. Sandos who performed most of the analysis. No-one in the Radio Astronomy
group can recall Mrs Sandos (who may have been a member of the Mathematical
Laboratory), but she undoubtedly helped with the complex data preparation process:
error-free punched tapes were required as input, and all the data had to be arranged
in a particular way in order to compensate for EDSAC’s lack of storage space.

By 1960, we see EDSAC 2 appearing in paper acknowledgements. However, the

workﬂow still retains a number of manual steps, as one paper notes:

It would be possible to record such information directly in digital form, but it has been
found relatively easy to transfer the present records to punched tape in a record reader and
manual perforator. [Costain and Smith(1960), p.412].

The acknowledgements are silent about who did this, but it’s quite likely to be

either PhD students or Computors.

4 Earth Rotation Aperture Synthesis and the Steady State

Hypothesis

In 1961, an extension of the aperture synthesis technique was developed: using the
rotation of the Earth to help ﬁll in the aperture of a telescope, thus performing Earth
Rotation Aperture Synthesis. This technique was prototyped using the Cambridge
178MHz telescope and EDSAC 2 — the new, more powerful, computer in the Math-
ematical Laboratory. This telescope and others were used to collect data that seri-
ously undermined the Steady State hypothesis.

3 The distance between a given pair of antennas is known as a baseline: the length of the longest
baseline dictates the resolution achievable by the telescope.

In 1961, Scott, Ryle and Hewish performed earth-rotation aperture synthesis for
the ﬁrst time [Scott et al(1961)Scott, Ryle, and Hewish]. This paper has a number
of interesting features. Firstly, this paragraph:

The processes of ﬁltering and convolution are basically equivalent and in this case where
the output of the receiver was already recorded in digital form it was convenient to carry
out a direct convolution with a time function whose Fourier transform provides the required
polar diagram. [Scott et al(1961)Scott, Ryle, and Hewish, p. 100].

This is an early use of a digital ﬁlter rather than a piece of electronics; the work is
moving from hardware to software. Note also that the digital form is paper tape!

To record the data, a sample and hold electronic circuit was implemented electro-
mechanically, using photo-electric cells, to output two columns of 5-hole tape for
each data point (giving ten bits of precision).4 Each tape started at the same sidereal
time: at the same time with respect to the ﬁxed stars in the sky, which is most useful
to astronomers, so non-local astronomical bodies can be located easily. The sidereal
time arrangement meant that the data could be efﬁciently processed — while ED-
SAC 2 had more storage space than EDSAC, programmers still could not afford to
be proﬂigate. During the data input phase, the data were convolved with a function
which allowed for error correction, and which also allowed the extraction of the sine
and cosine components which were required for the main computation. At this point,
the data were sorted into a more convenient order before being written onto mag-
netic tape. This magnetic tape was used as the input data for the main calculation,
in which the data were put through the Fourier Transform. The ﬁnal outputs were
effectively a 2-dimensional map of the sky, sampled at discrete intervals. The prob-
ability distribution of the measured intensity was also calculated and output. The
ﬁnal values for the sky map needed to be interpolated, but this was done manually,
possibly by the girls in the attic or junior members of the group.

As well as being the ﬁrst practical demonstration of aperture synthesis using the
earth to ﬁll in the aperture, this paper also was important for providing evidence
against the Steady State hypothesis. The authors note:

there is no evidence for a reduction in the density of radio sources... this observation implies
an isotropy which extends to at least 10,000 sources steradian. [Scott et al(1961)Scott, Ryle, and Hewish,
p. 111].

This isotropy in extra-galactic faint sources conﬂicted with predictions from
the Steady State model, which predicted that there should be many fewer faint
sources, and that there should be no difference between galactic and extra-galactic
sources. Once again we ﬁnd a woman tucked away in the acknowledgements:
Mrs R. Feinstein. Ruth Feinstein was employed by the Mathematical Laboratory
[of Cambridge Computer Laboratory(1999, [cited 2021 Apr 7])], and was an assis-
tant to Dr Lucy Slater, who became Head of Computing in the University’s De-
partment of Applied Economics [Andrews(2013, cited 2021 Apr 7)], p.6. Ruth Fe-
instein assisted her husband, Charles, with calculating and typing for his PhD thesis
[Offer(2008 Jun, [cited 2021 Apr 7]), p. 4]. Unfortunately, she left the Mathematical

Laboratory shortly after marriage [of Cambridge Computer Laboratory(1999, [cited 2021 Apr 7])],
and she seems to play no further part in computing for Radio Astronomy. She was,
along with Dr David Wheeler,responsible both for the running and design of the
programme [Scott et al(1961)Scott, Ryle, and Hewish, p. 111].5

4.1 The Steady State Hypothesis

A summary of the steady state hypothesis is that the universe is expanding, but has
no beginning and no end, and that its appearance does not change over time. In
contrast, the Big Bang theory states that the universe expanded from an initial state
of high density and temperature, and thus its appearance changes over time.

Ryle’s group was building up to attack the Steady State hypothesis. There are two
papers from Harriet Tumner and Patricia Leslie, both PhD researchers in the group
[Leslie(1961), Tunmer(1960)]. Neither paper mentioned using EDSAC 2, though
both used data from the Cambridge surveys that were processed using that computer.
These papers look at the brightness, density, size, and clustering of extra-galactic ra-
dio sources — where the Steady State and Big Bang hypotheses generated different
predictions.

Then there is a 1961 paper from Paul Scott and Martin Ryle [Scott and Ryle(1961)].

This looks at the relationship between the number of radio sources, and their ﬂux
density (essentially their brightness. The Steady State hypothesis assumes that there
is a particular relationship between the brightness of the source, and how many
sources of that brightness there are.

The acknowledgements in this paper read:

We should like to thank Dr Hewish and Miss Patricia Leslie for useful discoveries, and
Miss Ann Neville and Mr DR Marks for assistance in the reduction of observations.
[Scott and Ryle(1961), p. 397]

Ann Neville was one of Ryle’s PhD students, and she will appear as an author on
later papers.

Next there’s a paper by Hewish. He modelled the source number–ﬂux density re-
lationship, and used EDSAC 2 to do it. This is one of the earliest uses of the Monte
Carlo method in Radio Astronomy: successors to this method are being used today
as as key modelling technique [Feroz et al(2019)Feroz, Hobson, Cameron, and Pettitt].
Hewish doesn’t credit anyone else, so he most likely did a lot of the programming
himself. This contrasts with Ryle, who didn’t program at all, even though Ryle was
well aware of how essential computers were for aperture synthesis.6

Finally, there is a Ryle and Clarke paper of 1961 in which they showed that extra-
galactic radio sources have no variation in density in different parts of the sky —
the only variation comes when observing the Milky Way galaxy (which is nearby

in astronomical terms [Ryle and Clarke(1961)]. The observed source number-ﬂux
density relationship doesn’t match the steady state hypothesis. They conclude:

These observations do, however, appear to provide conclusive evidence against the steady
state model.

Any last hopes that the Steady State theorists had of salvaging their model was
blown away conclusively in 1964 when Penzias and Wilson detected the Cosmic
Microwave Background [Penzias and Wilson(1965)].

5 A radio survey of the North polar region

We now turn to analyse in some detail a paper from 1962, in which major advances
were made in both computing and Radio Astronomy [Ryle and Neville(1962)].

There are two major computational innovations in this paper. The ﬁrst is Wheeler’s
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, tersely described in a single paragraph,
plus an equation. From this, we can glean that the data from the sky needs to be
placed onto a Cartesian grid with (x, y) co-ordinates. This means data must be con-
verted from spherical co-ordinates that are most naturally used for observing ob-
jects on the sky into Cartesian co-ordinates. While the mathematician Gauss devel-
oped the theory of FFT, this practical implementation pre-dates the one by Cooley
and Tukey in 1965, which is usually credited as the ﬁrst practical implementation
[Heideman et al(1984)Heideman, Johnson, and Burrus].

The other programming innovation was the map degridding algorithm, which
enables conversion back from Cartesian co-ordinates into spherical co-ordinates, so
the radio sources are correctly located on the sky, which also ended up producing
some of the world’s ﬁrst computer graphics. The output from the computer was
plotted on a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube monitor, where it lasted for a few seconds,
just long enough to be photographed [Ahmed(2013), p. 63]. This work was done by
Elizabeth Waldram, then a Research Assistant in the group. This degridding algo-
rithm (and its successors) were used for all subsequent interferometers built by the
group.7

With the FFT and the degridding algorithm, it was possible to build a map of the
northern radio sky. It’s very likely that the ﬁnal construction of the map from the
photographic plates was made by the girls in the attic. This kind of mapping was
a large part of their job. They weren’t working directly with computers themselves,
but they were a vital part of the scientiﬁc workﬂow, often alongside secretarial staff
who would type up manuscripts. We can see a rare acknowledgment for the women
doing such work in a 1962 paper [Turtle and Baldwin(1962)]:

We are grateful to Miss C. Dunn and Mrs M. Warren for helping with the analysis and the
preparation of the contour maps.

Verity Allan

The contour maps were drawn from EDSAC 2 output [Turtle and Baldwin(1962),
p. 476].

With this paper, we have the foundations for modern radio astronomy comput-
ing. The FFT saves a lot of computational effort compared to the Direct Fourier
Transform which works with spherical co-ordinates. However, the use of the FFT
also necessitates the use of gridding and degridding algorithms, which we need to
ﬁrst transform our data into the right shape for the FFT, and then put it back into
spherical co-ordinates afterwards. FFT and gridding algorithms remain an impor-
tant part of Radio Astronomy research [Ye et al(2020)Ye, Gull, Tan, and Nikolic],
[Veenboer et al(2019)Veenboer, Petschow, van der Tol, and Offringa], [Nishimura et al(2021)Nishimura, Matsumoto, Yonetsu, Nakao, Fujita, Maezawa, Onishi, and Ogawa].

It’s clear from Wheeler’s inclusion in the acknowledgements rather than as
a co-author that the exclusion of women programmers from authorship wasn’t
purely a result of sexism. Sexism may still have played a part, as a majority of
those acknowledged for programming in Radio Astronomy papers were women
[Leedham and Allan(2021), p. 14]. Mar Hicks has shown how work done by women,
especially in the computing ﬁeld, was devalued, which may also have been a con-
tributing factor [Hicks(2018), passim]. Wheeler was acknowledged in Ryle’s Nobel
Prize lecture for his Fast Fourier Transform algorithm [Ryle(1992)]; none of the
women get mentioned.

6 Discussion

It’s clear from the preceding sections that women were deeply involved in the pro-
duction of scientiﬁc papers in the 1950s and 60s, and that they were also involved in
doing much of the programming and a good deal more of the science than is usually
recognised. The programming also required good mathematical skills and an under-
standing of Radio Astronomy, so that programmers could work with sidereal time
and Right Ascension and Declination (the spherical co-ordinate system used by as-
tronomers) and their conversion into Cartesian co-ordinates for use in the FFT —
something that mathematics undergraduates often struggle with. Perhaps the girls
in the attic didn’t require such advanced understanding, but they were expected to
work to the highest standards of accuracy.

It is extraordinarily difﬁculty to get a picture of many of the computational meth-
ods used. Programs were not routinely recorded at the time, though there are some
contemporaneous program booklets stored in the archive of the Department of Com-
puter Science and Technology.8 However, none of these survive for Radio Astron-
omy. The information presented in papers is minimal — usually just enough to allow
for some mathematical recreation, but not enough to understand the algorithms. This
may have been the result of the culture of the research group at the time; Ryle may

have maintained more of a war-time culture of secrecy than we ﬁnd desirable as
scientists today.9

It is also worth noting that, while women may have left the Mathematical Lab-
oratory on marriage, this wasn’t true for members of the Radio Astronomy group.
Indeed, programmers were in such high demand that they could work part-time
and ﬂexibly, many years ahead of this becoming widely available. Dr Waldram re-
calls working 10-15 hours a week in the early 1960s, to accommodate her childcare
needs.10

7 Conclusion

The acknowledgements to papers provide one of the few ways of ﬁnding out about
the work done in early scientiﬁc computing, as they often indicate that work was
done using a computer, and who did that work. We can get tantalising glimpses of
what that work was, and the people behind it. This could usefully be supplemented
by more archival work within the University, once this is possible again.

pioneers, who has given her time very generously, to Dr Donald Wilson, who provided many
