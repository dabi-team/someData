Abstract

This article introduces and describes the integrated
energy system of a the Low Emission Oil&Gas Open
It is a hypothetical
(LEOGO) reference platform.
case meant to represent a typical oil&gas installation
in the North Sea. The aim of this detailed speciﬁ-
cation is to serve as an open reference case where all
information about it can be publicly shared, facilitat-
ing benchmarking and collaboration. The relevance
of this reference case of an oﬀ-grid energy system is
not limited to the oil&gas industry, since it can also
been seen as a special kind of electrical micro grid.
The remote oﬀshore location makes it especially rele-
vant for studying oﬀshore wind power and ocean en-
ergy sources like wave power.

The speciﬁcation has an emphasis on the energy
system and electrical conﬁguration, but includes also
a basic description of oil ﬁeld and processing system.
The intention is that it will serve as a basis for en-
ergy system studies and relating power system sta-
bility analyses regarding the integration of renewable
energy sources. This allows for comparisons of a base
case with diﬀerent design modiﬁcations, new opera-
tional planning methods, power management strate-
gies and control concepts. Examples of possible mod-
iﬁcations are the replacement of gas turbines by wind
turbines, addition of energy storage systems, a more
variable operation of loads, etc.

The last part of the article demonstrates the be-
haviour of the reference platform implemented in two
software tools. One for operational planning and one
for dynamic power system analyses.

Introduction

To eliminate or reduce CO2 emissions from the local
energy system at oﬀshore oil&gas platforms, fossil-
fuel based gas turbines must either be equipped with
carbon capture and storage technologies [1], or be
replaced by clean alternatives such as power from
oﬀshore wind turbines, power via cable from shore,
a shift to hydrogen-based gas turbine fuels or fuel
cells, power from other renewable sources, or other
solutions that eliminate emissions. With new energy
supply alternatives, new operating strategies are re-
quired in order to best utilise the available resources
within the given constraints. And the new technol-
ogy will have diﬀerent electrical characteristics that
must be addressed. To demonstrate the adequacy
and beneﬁt of new low-emission solutions, new mod-
els and methods are needed to analyse system op-
eration and to show that the energy supply system
can provide the required security of supply and power
system stability.

ture updates.

To more easily demonstrate and test new operat-
ing strategies, diﬀerent system conﬁgurations, control
concepts and new ideas and methods for integrating
renewables intro an oﬀ-grid system, it is useful to
have an open and well-deﬁned test case as a common
basis for analyses. Therefore, we have created what
we call the Low Emission Oil&Gas Open (LEOGO)
It is intended as a well-deﬁned
reference platform.
study case where all underlying data can be pub-
licly shared. It constitutes both a speciﬁcation and a
dataset that is publicly available [2].

This work has been done within the LowEmission
research centre, which is a collaboration between re-
search and industry partners aiming to develop tech-
nology to reduce emissions from petroleum activi-
ties on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). The
LEOGO speciﬁcation has been created with crucial
input from industry partners in this centre.

Real oil&gas platforms of course diﬀer from each
other in important ways and analyses of this reference
platform can never substitute case-speciﬁc analyses.
But often, especially in early phases of development,
it is interesting to explore ideas in a general context
without a speciﬁc case in mind. And from a research
perspective, the main interest is often the demonstra-
tion of generic concepts where the peculiarities of the
study case are less important. Hence we believe that
a completely open and freely available case speciﬁca-
tion can prove useful both for academic research and
for industry development.

When required for a particular purpose, the refer-
ence case presented here may be adjusted. In such
cases, we would encourage authors to indicate very
clearly what modiﬁcations have been made when re-
porting their results.

The LEOGO speciﬁcation in its present form is pri-
marily concerned with the energy system and its links
with the topside processing system. Details regarding
reservoir and ﬂuid transport from the reservoir to the
platform is not included: The boundary is taken to
be the ﬂow and pressure at the separator inlet. Even
with this limited scope, it is inevitable that every de-
tail is not described in this speciﬁcation. Additional
information of general relevance may be added in fu-

1.2 Literature

Oﬀshore energy systems and solutions for CO2 emis-
sion reduction from oil&gas platforms is a topic that
has been addressed and analysed in several studies
in the literature [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], and several of these
consider Norwegian oﬀshore oil&gas platforms. How-
ever, the cases and the assumptions are not docu-
mented in detail, making it diﬃcult to test their con-
clusions and compare results. Lack of documentation
may be due to conﬁdentiality issues when working
with real cases and data obtained from industry. Or
it may be that even though the full data in principle
is open, the studies only describe the subset of the
data that is directly relevant for the discussion in the
given study.

Although we are not aware of any open datasets
of a similar scope to what we present here, a lot
of oil&gas data is openly available, notably histori-
cal production data made available through the Nor-
wegian Petroleum Directorate’s data repository [9].
Several open reservoir models [10] that are relevant
for analyses of subsurface dynamics also exist. A gen-
eral description of oﬀshore processing systems and
conﬁgurations can be found in [11]. However, for ex-
act modelling of power consumption, detailed infor-
mation is necessary regarding produced ﬂuid proper-
ties, export conditions and processing unit setpoints
and performance. Still, such details are normally not
available due to conﬁdentiality. Some examples of
modelled processing facilities and associated power
consumption can be found in [5, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Some
electrical data and diagrams from real North Sea
platforms have been published [16], but again the de-
scription is incomplete and the underlying data are
not provided.

1.3 Contributions

The main contribution of this article is the speciﬁ-
cation of a realistic and open reference oil&gas plat-
form as a suitable study case that facilitates repro-
duction and comparison of results obtained with dif-
ferent methods and tools. Additionally, actual im-

2

plementations of this case in two diﬀerent modelling
environments are presented together with basic sim-
ulation results that show the platform in operation
including some of its electrical characteristics. More
thorough analyses are left for future publications.

2 General speciﬁcations

The LEOGO reference platform is meant to be
representative of what could be considered a typi-
cal oil&gas platform on the Norwegian Continental
Shelf (NCS), with oil&gas production rates compared
to other ﬁelds as indicated in Figure 1. Although
a hypothetical ﬁeld and platform, its characteristics
have been chosen to be realistic.

The speciﬁcation has a strong emphasis on the en-
ergy system, and what is relevant for energy system
operational planning, power management and electri-
cal stability, considering timescales of a month down
to milliseconds. Reservoir dynamics and long-term
changes in production rates and resulting changes in
energy demand are not included. The data are avail-
able from a public repository [2], and this speciﬁca-
tion may be updated and expanded in the future as
needed. For example, to make the case relevant for
lifetime analyses and investment optimisation, energy
demand variations over many years are needed.

A schematic of the platform’s processing and en-
ergy system is shown in Figure 2, with details de-
scribed in the following.

2.1 Oil ﬁeld and processing character-

istics

All compressors on the LEOGO platform have elec-
tric drives, which is usually the case for modern plat-
forms. On many real older platforms, however, com-
pressors are driven directly by gas turbines, making it
more complicated to switch to another energy source
than natural gas. The choice of having only electric
drives is motivated by the fact that this allows more
easily for a shift of the primary energy source from
fossil fuel to renewables, which is the underlying mo-
tivation for this work. So either the LEOGO platform
may be viewed as a relatively modern installation, or
as an older one where the directly-driven compressors
have been replaced by electrically driven ones (even
though this is an expensive modiﬁcation).

Separation and gas re-compression occur in three
stages. These are integrated processes although they
are illustrated with separate blocks in Figure 2 for
simplicity.

Electricity demand on the platform is dominated
by gas compressors and water injection pumps. Note
that some of the compressed gas is re-circulated into
the well and used for gas lift. The electricity and
heat demand for utility and accommodation can be
considered as independent from the production rates.
The main heat demand is otherwise in the separa-
tion process. Heat is provided via waste heat re-
covery from the gas turbines. Flow rates and pres-
sure levels are speciﬁed in Figure 2. All ﬂow rates
are given as volumetric ﬂow at standard conditions
(Sm3/s), where standard conditions are 15 ◦C and nor-
mal atmospheric pressure, 101.325 kPa.

The LEOGO case represents an oil&gas ﬁeld with the
main characteristics as shown in Table 1. The plat-
form processes petroleum from multiple production
wells, and wellstream transport from the reservoirs
up to the platform is assisted by gas lift. Gas lift is
used instead of electric pumps since it is more com-
mon on Norwegian ﬁelds. The wellstream pressure at
the separator inlet is 2 MPa, as indicated in Figure 2.
Reservoir pressure is maintained via water injection,
using both water separated out from the wellstream,
and additional seawater.

The characteristics for oil, natural gas and water
ﬂuids are shown in Table 2. Gas gravity, compress-
ibility and temperature are needed to compute pres-
sure drop in gas pipeline using the Weymouth for-
mula. Speciﬁc heat ratio and the individual gas con-
stant are relevant for computing the energy demand
by compressors. The Darcy friction factors are used
to compute pressure drop in pipelines when using the
Darcy-Weissbach formula. In reality this factor is not
a constant, but dependent on other factors (such as
viscosity).

2.2 Energy supply

Regarding energy supply, multiple alternatives are
deﬁned: The base case represents a traditional sys-
tem with energy supply from gas turbine generators
and a set of variations represent systems with modi-
ﬁed electric power supply. Presently, two such varia-
tions are deﬁned, as shown in Table 3.

The gas turbine generators resemble GE LM2500
gas turbine generators with rated power of 28 MVA
(21.8 MW active power), ramping rates of 100 % per
minute, and minimum loading of 3.5 MW. Startup
time is set to be 15 minutes preparation plus 15 min-
utes synchronisation time, so a total of 30 minutes
from activation to delivery of electric power [18, 19].
Gas turbine fuel consumption is linearly related to
its electric power output, with eﬃciency 34.7 % at
full load and 20 % at 20 % loading [20], see Figure 3.
8 MW wind turbines are used for the case varia-
tions. And for Variation B with a battery storage sys-
tem, energy and power capacities of 4 MWh/4 MW
are used, with a round-trip eﬃciency of 90 %.

To have some operational margin and be able to
cope with unforeseen variations in power demand,
the system is operated with a reserve requirement of
5 MW. This is unused online power capacity that can
be activated automatically to maintain power bal-
ance.

2.3 Operating state

The electricity supply and demand by diﬀerent main
components in nominal operation in the base case
is shown in Table 4. The diﬀerence between load
and generation are mainly electrical losses of the ca-
bles, transformers and converters. A small part of
the deviation stems from the voltage-dependence of
the loads, which means that the loads slightly change
their power consumption when the real voltage is not
exactly the rated voltage.

Fluid and energy ﬂow rates are indicated in Fig-
ure 2. The relationship between ﬂow rates, pressure
levels and power demand by pumps and compressors

has been computed assuming water pump eﬃciency
of 0.75, oil pump eﬃciency of 0.6 and compressor ef-

on in Section 2.4. With the high loading of gas com-
pressors, the operating state may be considered to
represent the early plateau production phase with a
high production rate.

In this operating situation, two gas turbines could
be just enough to cover the electricity demand, but
the 5 MW reserve requirement means that all three
gas turbines are required to be online in normal op-
eration. The total heat demand is 8 MW, and is cov-
ered by waste heat recovery from the gas turbines,
see Table 5.

where η is eﬃciency, q is ﬂow rate and ∆p = p2 −
p1 is inlet/outlet pressure diﬀerence. For the wa-
ter injection pumps with ∆p = (25 − 0.7) MPa,
q = 0.277 Sm3/s, and η = 0.75 this gives Ppump =
8.97 MW. Similarly, for the oil export pumps with
∆p = (5 − 0.3) MPa, q = 0.098 Sm3/s, and η = 0.6 it
gives Ppump = 0.79 MW.

where ρ = 0.84 is the natural gas density, Z = 0.9 is

ual gas constant, T = 300 K is the inlet temperature,
k = 1.27 is the gas speciﬁc heat ratio, and a = k−1
k .
For the main gas export compressors with η = 0.75,
p1 =2 MPa, p2 =20 MPa, q = 68.3 Sm3/s this gives
Pcomp =24.2 MW

For gas re-compression in the separator train, we
determine the power demand by assuming a single
separation stage and intermediate gas pressure of
p1 = 1.3 MPa. With an outlet pressure of p2 = 2 MPa
we ﬁnd using the same formula a power consumption
of Pcomp = 3.8 MW.

Note that several simpliﬁcations are made here: In

a real system, usually the separation train consists of
several separators at diﬀerent pressure levels, and so
does the re-compression train. Consequently, the gas
rates leaving each separator stage and following gas
rates per compressor stage will be diﬀerent. Most free
gas, including lift gas which mainly consists of light
components, leaves the separation train in the ﬁrst
stage at higher pressure. The pressure for the oil,
however, will be reduced to almost atmospheric con-
ditions in order to remove remaining gas. Eﬃciencies
for pump and compressor systems will also depend
on system conﬁguration and ability to control these
units. These assumptions will lead to some deviation
from a real system, which should be acceptable at
this point where the focus is on the electrical part.

variability in wind power availability are given by
time-series data. Data provided with the LEOGO
speciﬁcation [2] includes time-series with 1-month du-
ration and 1 minute resolution.

For ﬂow rate / energy demand, the wellstream ﬂow
variation is set such that the power demand by com-
pressors and pumps, following a linear dependency
on the ﬂow rate, varies ±4 % with a period of about
25 minutes. This is based on inspection of power
data from a real case platform. Such power varia-
tions are not a generic characteristic, but highly de-
pendent on the speciﬁc case and the type of activities
and equipment in use. They are nevertheless included
in the present dataset to have some reasonable ﬂow
and power demand variation without being concerned
about their origin. We consider this acceptable as
studies based on this platform speciﬁcation are likely
to be mainly concerned with the energy system and
not the processing system. If the processing system
is not represented in the model, which is the case
for an electric only model, the implementation of the
variability is that the energy demand in pumps and
compressors vary according to the same time-series.
Wind power data has been obtained from publicly
available met mast measurements from Sulafjorden
at the coast of Norway [21]. Measurements used are
wind speeds at height 92.5 m with a resolution of
10 measurements per second (10 Hz sample rate). A
coastal fjord location is not fully representative of
oﬀshore conditions, with higher levels of turbulence
and variation, but is used for lack of better high-
resolution wind data that is publicly available and
relevant for North Sea locations.

Wind forecasts with a 30 minute resolution have

9

been created by re-sampling the wind speed mea-
surements and then adding random noise to rep-
resent forecast error. This results in a root mean
square error (RMSE) deviation of 3.3 m/s between
forecast and actual wind speeds at a resolution of 1
minute. Wind power has been computed using the
power curve of a real 8 MW oﬀshore wind turbine.
Wind speed measurement data and calculated wind
power data for March and April 2020, down-sampled
to 1 minute resolution are included with the LEOGO
dataset and used in the simulations reported here.

An extract of the time-series is shown in Figure 4.
The proﬁles could be considered as forecasts used for
planning. In actual operation, there will be some de-
viations from these forecasts. The nowcast proﬁle for
wind power should be interpreted as updated closer
to real-time forecast with reduced forecast error.

3 Electrical system

A full description of the electrical system requires a
lot of detail regarding the properties of cables and
transformers making up the electrical grid and the
properties of loads and generators connected to it.
For analyses of dynamic behaviour, generator control
systems play an important role. The same is true for
the control systems of other active components, such
as variable speed drives for pumps and compressors.
In the following, an overview of the various compo-
nents in the electrical system is given. The system
has been modelled in DIgSILENT PowerFactory and
this freely available model [2] includes further details
not given here. A simpliﬁed single-line diagram of
the electrical model is presented in Figure 5.

3.1 Voltage levels

The platform has four AC voltage levels and one DC
voltage level:

• 33 kVAC is the voltage that is used for the col-
lection grid of the wind turbines and the trans-
mission to the platform.

• 11 kVAC is the voltage at the main busbar sys-
tem. The gas turbine generators and several of

Figure 4: Normalised proﬁles. The ﬁgure shows a 12 hour extract of the data, with 5 min resolution.

the large loads are connected either directly or
via dedicated transformers to this busbar sys-
tem.

• 690 VAC is used for the utility busbar system is
where smaller pumps and compressors, and aux-
iliary equipment is connected. It is fed from the
11 kV system via transformers.

• 400 VAC is the common low voltage level, and
it is used here mainly for the accommodation
facilities. The 400 V system is fed from the 690 V
system via transformers.

• +1300 VDC is used in addition to the AC voltge
levels, where a drilling switchboard is operated
at this voltage level. This DC busbar system
is fed through active power converters in recti-
ﬁer mode, that connect via the converter trans-
formers to the 11 kV system. The DC system is
monopolar, and the return path is through earth.

3.2 Transformers

There are four stand-alone transformers on the plat-
form.
In this context stand-alone means that they
directly connect two busbar systems of diﬀerent volt-
age, in contrast to the other converter transformers
that are dedicated to connecting a power electronic
converter.

• The two larger units supply electricity from the
11 kV main busbar system to the 690 V utility
busbar system. These transformers have a rating
of 3.3 MVA each, a short circuit voltage of 11 %,
with 0.35 % losses. They have delta windings on
the high voltage side, and star windings at the
low voltage side, with the star point earthed with
a 4 Ω resistor (100 A)

• The two smaller units supply the accommoda-
tion facilities at 400 V from the 690 V utility bus-
bar system. These transformers have a rating of
600 kVA each, a short circuit voltage of 6 %, with
1 % losses. They have a similar delta-star conﬁg-
uration, but their star point is directly earthed.

The 11 kV, 690 V and +1300 VDC busbar systems
are realised as split single busbars with tie breaker.
The 33 kVAC is realised with simple single busbars.
The 400 V level consists of two separate single bus-
bars without a tie breaker. All tie breakers are nor-
mally open, besides the 11 kV main busbar system
which is normally closed.

3.3 Cables

Three AC cable types and one DC cable type are used
on the platform:

• 33 kV 3x240 mm2 XLPE-insulation copper-
conductor AC cables are used for the wind tur-

bines. This cable type has a rated current of
489 A.

• 11 kV 3x120 mm2 XLPE-insulation copper-
conductor AC cables are used for the majority
of applications. This cable type has a rated cur-
rent of 360 A.

• 1.5 kVDC 1x500 mm2 XLPE-insulation copper-
conductor DC cables are used for the connection
between the drilling DC busbar system and the
rectiﬁers that feed power to it. Four cables in
parallel are used for each connection, due to the
high currents involved.

• 11 kV 3x240 mm2 XLPE-insulation copper-
conductor AC cables are used where a higher
current rating of 520 A is needed. For the con-
nection of each gas turbine generator, four par-
allel cables of this type are used. This cable type
is (for simplicity) also used for the two short
low voltage connections between the 690 V bus-
bar system and the 690-400 V transformer at the
accommodation facilities (even though a lower
voltage rating would be suﬃcient there).

3.4 Gas turbine generators

The platform has three gas turbine generators with
a rated power of 28 MVA, rated voltage of 11 kV and
rated power factor of 0.85. They have star windings,
and the star point is earthed with 127 Ω (50 A). The
generators are directly connected to the main busbar
system. The gas turbines are controlled by governors
and the synchronous generators by static excitation
systems. All three turbine-generator-transformer se-
tups are identical.

The gas-turbine-based electricity supply of
the
LEOGO platform is accompanied by three 8 MW di-
rect drive type-4 wind turbines. The rated power
factor is 0.9, and the generator voltage is 690 V,
which is transformed to 33 kV by a dedicated trans-
former. The wind turbine model attempts to resem-
ble the Siemens Gamesa SG 8.0-167 DD wind tur-
bine, as this turbine type is used for the same purpose
on a real oﬀshore installation (the Hywind Tampen
project [22]). However, as no model of the SG 8.0-
167 DD is openly available, the similarity is limited
to the general parameters like power rating, turbine
type, voltage level, power curve, e.t.c. The details of
the implemented wind turbine model just resemble a
generic wind turbine.

3.6 Induction motors

There are three types of directly grid-connected in-
duction motors:

• Three sea water lift pumps (SWL) are driven
by 750 kW 11 kV induction motors with a rated
power factor of 0.87 and an eﬃciency of 96.9 %

• Two air compressors (ACO) are driven by
1.3 MW 11 kV induction motors with a rated
power factor of 0.9 and an eﬃciency of 95.9 %

• Two induction motors (ASM) at 0.25 MW and
690 V with a rated power factor of 0.92 and an
eﬃciency of 96.1 %, generally representing one of
the low voltage machines at the utility busbars.

All induction motors that are a part of a variable
speed drive are not modelled in detail, as explained
in Subsection 3.7.

3.7 Variable speed drives

The regular (with dedicated power supply) variable
speed drives consist of induction motors that are in-
terfaced with a transformer and a back-to back AC-
DC-AC converter. The transformer is not earthed
and draws electric power from the main 11 kV bus-
bar and reduces the voltage to a suitable level for the

drive. This reduced AC voltage is then rectiﬁed by
the active grid-side converter to provide the AC-DC-
AC converters internal DC voltage. The machine-side
converter is supplied from this internal DC voltage,
and it drives the machine with variable frequency and
variable voltage AC.

There are three types of variable speed drives:

• 8.2 MW is the rating of the largest VSDs. Their
transformer is delivering 3.3 kV from the main
11 kV busbar, and this is then rectiﬁed to
+6 kVDC by the active grid side converter

• 4.8 MW is the rating of the medium-size VSDs.
They operate at the same voltage levels as the
8.2 MW units, just at lower currents.

• 1.5 MW is the rating of the smaller VSDs. Their
transformer delivers 690 VAC from the main
11 kV busbar. This 690 VAC is then rectiﬁed to
+1300 VDC by the active grid side converter.

In addition to these regular VSDs, there are the
drilling VSDs that share a common power supply.
There are two parallel transformer-converter systems
where the 3.3 MVA transformer (not earthed) draws
power from the 11 kV busbar, transforms it to 690 V,
and the active power converter rectiﬁes it, and sup-
plies the +1300 VDC busbar system, as mentioned in
Subsection 3.1. This common DC busbar is diﬀerent
as compared to the other VSDs, where the DC volt-
age is only internal to each back-to-back converter.
The machine side converters of the drilling VSDs are
supplied from the common DC busbar, and they drive
the induction machines.

For all VSDs, the induction machine and the
machine-side converter are not yet modelled in de-
tail; they only appear as an ideal DC loads, which
is how they behave as seen from the grid in steady
state operation. This simpliﬁcation was judged ac-
ceptable, as the back-to-back converter setup of the
VSDs suﬃciently decouples the grid dynamics from
the rotating machine. It is, however, planned to im-
prove the model in the future by adding these details.

12

3.8 General low voltage loads

All the smaller loads (less than 250 kVA) are not mod-
elled one by one in detail, but represented as aggre-
gated loads. There are two types of these aggregated
loads:

• Two 690 VAC loads at the utility busbars with
a rating of 2.75 MW and an actual consumption
of 1.05 MW, and a power factor of 0.9. 60 % of
this load is induction motors, while the remain-
ing 40 % are static frequency-independent loads
with the composition 28 % constant power, 4 %
constant current and 8 % constant resistance.

• Two 400 VAC loads at the accommodation bus-
bars with a rating of 0.5 MW and an actual con-
sumption of 0.25 MW, and a power factor of 0.98.
10 % of this load is induction motors, while the
remaining 90 % are static frequency-independent
loads with the composition 36 % constant power,
9 % constant current and 45 % constant resis-
tance.

4 Examples of simulation re-

sults

Simulation results from both the operational optimi-
sation model and the electrical model are presented
in this section. The purpose of this is not the re-
sults in itself, but to demonstrate that the LEOGO
platform speciﬁcation makes sense and delivers rea-
sonable results.

4.1 Operational optimisation model

The platform speciﬁcation above has been imple-
mented as an input dataset [2] for analyses with the
openly available Oogeso tool [23]. The system as rep-
resented in Oogeso is illustrated in Figure 6. As the
ﬁgure shows, the emphasis is on the energy system,
with a rather simpliﬁed description of the processing.
For example the separation process is represented by
a single unit, and the multi-phase wellstream ﬂow is
represented by its oil, gas and water components.

The main reason for including the processing sys-
tem is to capture the link between energy demand
and oil&gas production, and its main constraints.
This will be relevant when considering the poten-
tial for demand-side ﬂexibility to allow higher share
of wind energy supply with minimum energy storage
requirements.

The Oogeso tool applies a rolling-horizon mixed-
integer linear optimisation model to schedule genera-
tion output and start and stop signals based on fore-
casts of demand and energy availability. The rolling
horizon is to account for delays in ramping and ﬂex-
ibility in storage utilisation or demand.

To demonstrate that the LEOGO speciﬁcation
makes sense, two simple simulations have been run
over a timespan of 1000 minutes with timesteps of 5
min. The ﬁrst is a modiﬁed version of the base case
(see Table 3) where the wellstream ﬂow is reduced
by 20 % between the 500 and 750 minute points.
The second simulation represents Variation A and in-
cludes wind turbines with their associated variability.
Figure 7 shows supply by source in the two simu-
lation cases. The observed small ﬂuctuations in total
power demand and supply are due to the small vari-
ations in the input wellstream ﬂow rate data. In the
base case, we see that initially all three gas turbines
are online, sharing the load evenly. As the wellstream
ﬂow drops after 500 minutes, the energy demand in
compressors and pumps also drops and then only two
gas turbines are needed. Switching oﬀ the third gen-
erator is beneﬁcial because the eﬃciency of the gas
turbines is higher at higher loading, resulting in lower
total fuel consumption and therefore lower CO2 emis-
sions per output electric power. In the case with wind
power, there is more variability and multiple start
and stops of the third gas turbine.

The available online power reserve is shown in Fig-
ure 8. In the base case, there is plenty of available re-
serve when all three gas turbines are running. When
the power demand drops after 500 minutes, the third
gas turbine is switched oﬀ, as the two remaining gas
turbines are then suﬃcient to both cover the load
and provide the required reserve. At 750 minutes,
the power demand increases and then the third gas
turbine is switched on again. Although two gas tur-
bines could still provide suﬃcient power to meet the

demand, there wouldn’t be enough reserve without
the third gas turbine.

In the case with wind power, we see a similar situa-
tion with plenty of available reserve when all three gas
turbines are on, and operation close to the threshold
otherwise.

A thorough analysis of diﬀerent conﬁgurations
and operating strategies of the LEOGO platform is
planned for a separate publication.

4.2 Electrical model

The electrical system (more precisely, the electro-
mechanical system), as discribed in Section 3, has
been implemented in the DIgSILENT PowerFactory
simulation tool. As this model contains no propri-
etary information, it has been made public and can
be freely downloaded [2], used and modiﬁed. This
RMS domain model is suitable to assess electrical
system behaviour in more detail, allowing to study
power ﬂow, electro-mechanical transients, outer-level
controls, stability indices, etc.

To display some of the functionalities of the model,
the event of the loss (disconnection) of a gas turbine
has been simulated for the base case (three gas tur-
bines only) and the Variation A (three gas turbines
and three wind turbines). The battery of Variation B
has not yet been implemented in the electrical model.
In the base case, wind power output is zero, and all
three gas turbines operate, of which one is lost. In
Variation A, the three wind turbines operate at full
power output, and only two gas turbines operate, of
which one is lost, and the other having to handle the
incident alone. It should be noted that the disconnec-
tion of a gas turbine is a critical event, that stresses
the electrical power system beyond the capability of
the 5 MW operational reserve.

The frequency course during the simulated events
is displayed in Figure 9, and the active power out-
put of the remaining gas turbine (one of the two re-
maining gas turbines in the base case) is displayed in
Figure 10.

the full-wind-power simulation, only one remaining
gas turbine has to handle the situation alone (red
curves). However, only around 8.3 MW of generation
is lost, because more than half of the power comes
from the wind turbines, with the gas turbines
operating at low power set-points. The remaining
gas turbine (also at a low power set-point) has

larger headroom for handling the incident. Both
events lead to a signiﬁcant frequency disturbance,
which is accompanied by some decaying electro-
mechanical oscillations. The simulations show the
electro-mechanical transients in case of a major
power imbalance, as an example of what such an
electro-mechanical RMS-domain model can simulate.
It should be noted that all of the simulations were
performed with a standard wind turbine controller.

upward headroom, and no response to the frequency
disturbance with supportive control actions like fast
frequency support or virtual inertia, which could as-
sist the remaining gas turbine in handling the inci-
dent. Load shedding, which also takes action to han-
dle frequency disturbances, is not yet implemented in
the simulation model.

5 Conclusion

This article has presented the LEOGO platform as
an open reference case that can be easily shared and
where no data are conﬁdential. Its main purpose is
to make it easy to investigate and compare the op-
eration of low-emission oil&gas platform energy sys-
tems, or more general oﬀ-grid energy systems, to test
modelling concepts, operational planning strategies,
control implementations etc. in a transparent way. It
facilitates comparisons of results obtained using dif-
ferent approaches and makes it easier for modellers
to beneﬁt from each other than is the case for stud-
ies where the underlying assumptions and data are
conﬁdential or poorly documented.

The speciﬁcation has a strong emphasis on the en-
ergy system, and more comprehensive descriptions of
the ﬂuid transport and processing systems are left
for potential future work. Also, a description of the
reservoir would be a natural extension. Ongoing re-
search is investigating processing system constraints
and the links between ﬂow rates and energy demand,
with the aim to develop linearised models for investi-
gating the potential for utilising energy system ﬂex-
ibility in combination with variable wind. Updates
to the electrical model may be needed to perform
more detailed electrical analyses and to investigate
more advanced control strategies and to check the
inﬂuence on stability. Details to be realised in future
revisions include the machine-side power converters
and the machines of the VSDs and a power manage-
ment system that coordinates the operation of the
gas turbines.

As a ﬁnal remark, we expect that the speciﬁcation
and the models presented will be revised and updated
with new version tags when relevant. Contributions

from others are welcome.
