ABSTRACT

We present the design and performance of the GROWTH-India telescope, a 0.7 m robotic telescope
dedicated to time domain astronomy. The telescope is equipped with a 4k back-illuminated camera
gives a 0.82◦ ﬁeld of view and a sensitivity of mg(cid:48) ∼20.5 in 5-min exposures. Custom software han-
dle observatory operations: attaining high on-sky observing eﬃciencies ((cid:38) 80%) and allowing rapid
response to targets of opportunity. The data processing pipelines are capable of performing PSF
photometry as well as image subtraction for transient searches. We also present an overview of the
GROWTH-India telescope’s contributions to the studies of Gamma-ray Bursts, the electromagnetic
counterparts to gravitational wave sources, supernovae, novae and solar system objects.

1. INTRODUCTION

Time-domain astrophysics (TDA) has become a ma-
jor thrust area around the world, and is poised to con-
tinue growing in the coming decade (Srinivasan et al.
2004; de Zeeuw & Molster 2007; NRC Decadal Survey
2010; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine 2021). The studies of transient sources allow

harshkumar@iitb.ac.in

us to probe some of the most extreme environments in
the universe and, in turn, address open questions from
such diverse ﬁelds as the distributions of planets around
other stars, the fates of massive stars, the nature of ac-
cretion and jets, and nucleosynthesis in the universe (see
for instance LSST Science Collaboration et al. 2009;
Kasliwal 2011, and references therein). Time-domain
studies span many orders of magnitudes in timescales.
In optical bands, new high speed instruments study vari-
ability at sub-second timescales (Dhillon et al. 2007,

2016, etc.), while long-term variability studies have
spanned decades (Grindlay et al. 2009; Graham et al.
2015).

The varied classes of targets studied in TDA each
have their speciﬁc requirements from observational fa-
cilities. Many sources like supernovae, novae, period
objects like binaries, etc., require monitoring at a ca-
dence of one or a few days: a task that is cumbersome
for classically scheduled telescopes but straightforward
for queue-scheduled ones. Fast transients like afterglows
of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) or electromagnetic coun-
terparts to gravitational wave sources (EMGW) demand
fast responses within minutes or even seconds of discov-
ery of the transient. They also require a geographically
distributed network of observatories to ensure that the
target is visible to at least some of them. Some sources
require continuous monitoring, unhindered by the di-
urnal cycle. This too, requires a geographically spread
out set of observatories coordinating their eﬀorts. To ad-
dress these issues, various global networks have been cre-
ated with telescopes geographically distributed around
the world — for instance, the Global Relay of Observa-
tories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH; Kasli-
wal et al. 2019), Las Cumbres Observatory Global Tele-
scope (LCOGT; Brown et al. 2013), Global Rapid Ad-
vanced Network Devoted to the Multi-messenger Ad-
dicts (GRANDMA; Antier et al. 2020), and MASTER
(Lipunov et al. 2010). Typically, such networks have had
more telescopes in the “western hemisphere”, with lim-
ited participation from “eastern” countries. Indian as-
tronomers have been active in time-domain astrophysics
using a variety of optical and infra-red facilities in the
country (for a brief overview of the facilities, see Sagar
2017 and references therein). However, these facilities
are classically scheduled and heavily subscribed, with
time-domain observations largely executed through a
limited number of Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) trig-
gers.

This motivated us to set up the GROWTH-India Tele-
scope (GIT), a fully autonomous dedicated telescope for
time-domain astrophysics. The facility was set up with
certain key goals in mind. The main focus was to have
a fully automated system that can respond to fast tran-
sient triggers with minimal lag, including autonomous
responses to GCN (Barthelmy et al. 2000) and similar
triggers. A closely aligned goal was to create automated
and standardised pipelines for all data processing so that
the team can focus on interpretation rather than data
reduction. The telescope needed to be sensitive to about
21 mag in optical, with ∼ 1◦ ﬁeld of view. We opted for
an oﬀ-shelf telescope and camera for rapid deployment,

high reliability, and ready availability of technical sup-
port. GIT would work closely with partners in the
GROWTH sharing the key science goals (§6).
In this paper, we describe the conﬁguration, perfor-
mance, and some scientiﬁc results from GIT. The paper
is organised as follows. In §2 we describe the site, tele-
scope, and the instruments. §3 deals with the nightly
autonomous observing procedures, while the data pro-
cessing is described in §4. The sensitivity and perfor-
mance of the telescope are discussed in §5. Lastly, §6
enumerates the key science goals of GIT and presents
some results from the ﬁrst few years of operation.

2. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

GIT is a 70-cm telescope designed for autonomous op-
erations, backed up by local and remote observing capa-
bilities. The primary camera is an Andor iKon-XL 230
CCD camera with a 16.8-megapixel back-illuminated
sensor. The telescope and camera have been chosen to
provide a unique combination of a 0.7◦ wide ﬁeld of view
(FoV) and good sensitivity. The telescope was installed
and commissioned in the summer of 2018 and is jointly
operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

2.1. Observing site location

GIT is situated at the Indian Astronomical Observa-
tory (IAO), located atop Mt. Saraswati, Digpa Ratsa Ri
in Hanle, Ladakh. The observatory is located at latitude
32◦46(cid:48)46(cid:48)(cid:48) N and longitude 78◦57(cid:48)51(cid:48)(cid:48) E, at an altitude
of ∼4500 m above the sea level. The IAO site has ∼ 190
clear photometric nights per year (Cowsik et al. 2002).
IAO has meagre precipitation of < 7 mm annually,
thanks to Himalayan mountains that cast a rain shadow
on the observatory. With low temperature, low humid-
(cid:48)(cid:48)
ity, a typical seeing of < 1
(Cowsik et al. 2002) and me-
dian sky brightness of µV = 21.28 mag/arcsec2 (Stalin
et al. 2008), IAO is one of the best sites for optical as-
tronomy in India. The observatory has its weather sta-
tion accessible by all telescopes present at the observa-
tory. However, in the interest of an additional level of
safety, the weather station is not directly integrated into
the telescope system, and the dome closure/opening is
handled by the staﬀ at other telescopes of the obser-
vatory. The observatory has an engineering team that
regularly handles the maintenance of the telescope sys-
tem. The observatory is remotely accessible through a
satellite link from the CREST campus of the Indian In-
stitute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.

been tested with APOGEE Alta U32 and SBIG STF
8300EN instruments which were used on the system dur-
ing commissioning phase and during the unavailability
of the primary camera due to technical failures. The fol-
lowing section provides details of all cameras utilised on
GIT to date. The cameras are operated through auto-
mated command-line scripts to perform all operations.

2.3.1. Primary instrument: Andor

The primary instrument for GIT is an Andor XL-230
camera, which is also in use at present. This 4096 ×
4108 pixels camera, in combination with CDK 700 tele-
scope, provides an eﬀective ﬁeld of view of 49(cid:48) radius
circle. This back-illuminated camera has high quan-
tum eﬃciency (QE) of > 95%. The built-in thermo-
electric (TE) system and air cooling can lower the op-
erating temperatures to 60◦ below ambient. The op-
erating temperatures can be lowered further with water
cooling, but this is not used at GIT due to low am-
bient winter temperatures and robustness requirements
for an autonomous telescope. We chose the CCD with
15 µm pixel size to sample the point spread function
(PSF) properly, providing a pixel scale of 0.676
. The
CCD has a full-well depth of 1,50,000 e−, providing a
large dynamic range. With linearity of > 99% and very
low dark current (∼ 0.0024 ADUs/pix/s), the CCD is
well suited to long exposures without signiﬁcant non-
uniformity in images. The CCD supports a wide range
of readout speeds, from a 10 kHz readout giving a noise
of just 3.5 e− to a fast 4 MHz mode that allows a full-
frame readout in just 4 s, at the cost of a higher 23.4 e−
readout noise.
In practice, we typically use a single-
port readout at 2 MHz. User-deﬁnable binning makes
the CCD versatile to use in desired science cases. De-
tailed speciﬁcations of this Andor camera are listed in
Table 1, while more details from the vendor are available
at https://andor.oxinst.com/products/ikon-xl-and-ik
on-large-ccd-series/ikon-xl-230.

2.3.2. Apogee

An Apogee Alta U32 camera with a 3-megapixel Ko-
dak Blue Plus sensor was used at GIT from August 2020
– March 2021. The camera has a rectangular image lay-
out with 2184 × 1472 pixels, where each square pixel
has a 6.8-micron size (0.346(cid:48)(cid:48)on the sky). The camera
has an imaging area of 14.8 × 10.0 mm that provides
an FoV of 11.17(cid:48) × 7.52(cid:48). The camera’s full well capac-
ity is 55000 e−a peak QE (610 nm) ∼ 85%. The cam-
era features TE cooling with forced air, which enables
it to cool to a maximum of 50◦C below ambient tem-
perature with a temperature stability of ±0.1◦C. This
camera can expose in the range of 30 ms to 183 min with

optical design1 (Figure 1). With a focal ratio of f/6.5
and focal length of 4540 mm, the telescope provides a
70 mm image circle, corresponding to a ∼ 0.86 degree di-
ameter circle on the sky. The Nasmyth focus design and
dual truss structure make it possible to mount two in-
struments simultaneously and switch between them with
minimal overheads. This CDK telescope is driven by in-
tegrated direct-drive motors, providing zero backlashes,
zero periodic error, and requires minimal maintenance.
The telescope can reach slewing speed of up to 50 de-
grees/s enabling it to track fast-moving satellites and
near-earth objects. Further, the telescope has a very
good pointing accuracy of 10(cid:48)(cid:48) and tracking accuracy of
< 1(cid:48)(cid:48) for a typical 300 s exposure. For all practical pur-
poses we limit the longest exposure to 10 minutes. The
full speciﬁcations of the telescope are listed in Table 1.

GIT uses an Andor XL-230-84 CCD as its primary
instrument. In addition, the system’s performance has

2.56-microsecond increments. The system is read out at
1 MHz with a low readout noise of 8e−.

2.3.3. SBIG STF-8300EN

Another camera used at GIT is an SBIG STF-8300EN
camera with a Kodak KAF-8300 CCD sensor with a
3326 × 2504 pixel array. Each pixel is 5.4 µm square in
size, providing a plate-scale of 0.24(cid:48)(cid:48). Its 8.3 million pix-

els camera gives an imaging area of 17.96 mm × 13.52
mm. The camera has a high readout speed, enabling it
to read the entire frame in ∼ 1 s with a typical readout
noise of 9.3 e−. The even illuminated shutter helps in
taking exposures as short as 0.1 s. On the higher end, an
hour-long exposure can be obtained. This SBIG camera
has a higher dark current of 0.15 e−/pix/s despite an
ability to cool up to 40–45◦C below ambient tempera-

like rebuilding the pointing model, the observer directly
accesses the softwares through the windows PC at the
telescope site. We discuss key components of the control
software in the following sections.

3.1. Observation Scheduling

The default robotic observation mode of GIT is the
queue-based observation mode. Observation scheduling
of GIT is illustrated in Figure 3. An object list is pre-
pared before starting the nightly observations, contain-
ing all relevant information for selected targets. This list
is parsed to the scheduling computer, which orders the
targets based on their priority assigned by the observer.
The observer chooses this priority by taking a particular
target’s set time and scientiﬁc importance into account.
The control computer automatically takes the informa-
tion from the object list for any particular object and
performs observations. New targets like Gamma-Ray
Bursts (GRBs) can be manually or automatically added
to the queue at any time by using specialised remote
scripts. This is particularly important for rapid response
to GRBs etc. Once a target is added to the queue, it
is processed as per the assigned priority like any other
target in the queue. This means that the ongoing image
sequence is ﬁnished before switching to any such new
target.

3.2. Calibration image acquisition

Nightly observations begin with a series of calibration
exposures that are used for processing all science images
acquired during that night.

3.2.1. Bias frames

Bias frames are zero-second readouts to measure the
unwanted electronic signal. Bias frames for our primary
Andor camera are stable throughout the night. There-
fore, we acquire these frames at the start and end of
the night. The CCD is cooled to −40◦C, which helps
stabilise the bias frames despite ambient temperature
ﬂuctuations.

3.2.2. Dark frames

A dark frame measures the thermal noise of the cam-
era, which is acquired by taking images with the shutter
closed to avoid external photons contributing to the im-
age counts. We minimise the dark current by cooling
the camera to −40◦C. As mentioned in §2.3.1, the An-
dor CCD has a very low dark current. To verify the
same, we acquired the dark frames at a ﬁxed tempera-
ture at various exposure times ranging from 150 s - 700 s
in steps of 50–100 s. Using a linear ﬁt to the data, we
obtained a typical dark current of 0.0052 ADUs/pix/s at

shown by a vertical dashed lines and their values are quoted
at the top of the plot.

ture. Compared to our other two cameras, this camera
has a lower full well capacity (25,000 e−) and QE (56%).

2.4. Filter system
SDSS u(cid:48) g(cid:48) r(cid:48) i(cid:48) z(cid:48) ﬁlters (Figure 2) are integrated into
a ﬁlter wheel assembly design. The closed-loop control
system of the ﬁlter wheel provides precise position and
velocity control. The system is realised with a PSoC5LP
micro-controller unit (MCU) based on system-on-chip
(SoC) architecture. The ﬁlters are arranged in a wheel
that can rotate in both clockwise and anti-clockwise di-
rections to minimise the ﬁlter change time while chang-
ing extreme position ﬁlters. A python-based script com-
municates with the ﬁlter wheel via an RS232 interface to
perform all operations like the status of the wheel, hom-
ing position, current ﬁlter position, ﬁlter change opera-
tions, etc. The typical ﬁlter change time among adjacent
ﬁlters is 2.30 s.

3. OBSERVING WITH GIT

GIT operates in a default automated mode for nightly
observations. The entire telescope assembly operations
are controlled by two PCs that run on the Linux and
Windows operating systems. The core component is
the Linux PC, which runs the custom python-based
operations software for GIT. This includes scheduling,
controlling the camera, ﬁlter wheel, data storage and
listening for Target of Opportunity com-
archiving,
mands, error reporting, etc. The telescope and dome
are controlled by the Windows PC that hosts the soft-
wares for the telescope and dome controls. These soft-
wares open a socket to send and receive commands for
various operations of the telescope and dome, thus con-
trolling them via communicating over Ethernet without
any manual intervention. For higher-level operations

−40◦C CCD temperature, broadly consistent with the
camera datasheet. This amount of dark current does
not impact the science exposure. Hence, the dark frame
acquisition can be omitted for exposure < 600 s.

3.2.3. Flat frames

Twilight ﬂat frames are used in GIT to correct the
pixel response of CCD. A python-based code automati-
cally acquires well-exposed ﬂat frames for all ﬁlters dur-
ing the evening twilight. u(cid:48) and z(cid:48) band ﬂats are ac-
quired ﬁrst as they require brighter sky conditions due
to high extinction in these bands. These are followed by
g(cid:48), r(cid:48) and i(cid:48) band exposures. The code checks the count
levels in the images and eliminates any saturated or
under-exposed ﬂat images. It adjusts the exposure time
for subsequent ﬂat frames to maintain median counts in
the range of 30,000–45,0000.

3.3. Non-sidereal mode observations

Non-sidereal observing has been integrated with the
main scheduler of GIT to streamline observations of
moving objects. With GIT, we perform two types of
objects in non-sidereal mode: 1) conﬁrmation of newly
discovered Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) by GROWTH

partners and other observers, 2) follow-up observations
of speciﬁc targets with conﬁrmed orbits.

Due to the signiﬁcant sky plane motion of these ob-
jects with respect to ﬁxed background stars, the coordi-
nates of these targets keep on changing with time. For
objects conﬁrmed by Minor Planet Centre (MPC), a list
of targets is prepared as per scientiﬁc interests. This
list resides at IIT Bombay and comprises designations
and tentative observation times of the objects. Daily at
5 PM local time, the coordinates of these non-sidereal
targets are updated automatically by querying the MPC
database. After querying the coordinates, a non-sidereal
nightly ﬁle is generated as per the required format of
the GIT scheduler, which is then synced automatically
to the system at the observatory in Hanle, where it gets
combined with the sidereal target list. Since the non-
sidereal targets may have a signiﬁcant sky-plane mo-
tion, we approximate the coordinates of the targets at
the time of observation by linearly extrapolating the co-
ordinates in the nightly ﬁle. For potential Near-Earth
Object (NEO) discovered on the same night, the non-
sidereal observations can be triggered on GIT in real-
time, thus enabling active follow-up of these candidates.

The GIT system is integrated with several helper
“bots” that monitor various operational parameters.
These bots perform various tasks like automatically trig-
gering telescopes for ToO observations, monitoring ob-
servation as well as data processing, and summarising
the last night’s observations in the form of a nightly
report. These reports are then posted on slack2 groups
for human inspection. In critical situations, telephonic /
text message alerts can also be sent to designated users.
“Khabri Jr”: GIT observations are monitored by the
Khabri Jr slack bot. This bot updates the observers
about a night’s observation plan and sends near real-
time telescope observation updates via slack.
In case
of instrument failures, the scheduling system can debug
ﬁrst-order errors. However, in certain cases, when the
debugger fails to solve the problem, the slack bot can
identify the errors in the real-time observation log and
notify designated users by a telephone call through a
“Twilio” API3 so that debugging can be handled man-
ually.

This

slack bot

“Phineas”:

continuously looks
the GRB alerts on Gamma-ray Coordinates
for
Network/Transient Astronomy Network (GCN/TAN)
server4. Upon receiving a trigger alert, the bot checks it
against triggering criteria for GIT and generates a trig-
ger if these criteria are met. The bot sends the generated
trigger to the telescope scheduling computer to add it to
the main queue. A similar bot looks for Gravitational
Wave (GW) event candidates during the observing run
of the advanced GW detectors (LIGO, Virgo, Kagra)
and notiﬁes designated users through a phone call. For
future runs, this script is also being upgraded to create
an observing schedule and start observations in parallel
to the user notiﬁcations.

“Khabri”: The GIT automated data reduction
pipeline is integrated with Khabri (messenger) bot,
which tracks data download and reduction processes.
Near real-time processing, updates are sent to slack dur-
ing data processing. On completion of data reduction,
the bot generates a summary report which contains in-
formation about the observed targets, time of observa-
tions, ﬁlter information, reduction status, and GIT ob-
servation performance statistics for last night’s observa-
tions. At the end of each night’s observation, the bot
generates nightly statistics plots for images’ seeing and
depth variation during the night as a part of the sum-
mary report.

“Gitty”: This bot is designed to send data to rele-
vant observers automatically. After the generation of
the nightly summary report, the bot ﬁlters out data un-
der diﬀerent proposals and syncs the processed data to
the necessary destinations for observers to access in min-
imal time.

4. DATA PROCESSING

The automated scripts regularly download data from
the observatory without any human intervention. Once
downloaded, this data is processed by a fully automated
data reduction pipeline and archived.

4.1. Data transfer

All the raw data are stored at the data storage unit
at IAO and need to be transferred to IIT Bombay for
processing. These data transfers are executed through
the CREST campus of IIA, which is connected to IAO
through a satellite link. Data are downloaded to the
data relay unit at CREST in the daytime for regular
observations. However, we download data in real-time
via automated download scripts for important time-
constrained observation. A network-attached storage
(NAS) at the CREST also serves as a redundant backup
of all raw data. The typical GIT raw data load for a sin-
gle night is ∼ 3 Gigabytes. Data ﬁles arrive at CREST
and are immediately copied to IIT Bombay over the
internet for further processing. A NAS system at IIT
Bombay archives the raw as well as the processed data
that can be accessed by an internal query interface. All
the data remain proprietary.

4.2. Image reduction

The image reduction and processing pipeline handles
all tasks required for converting the observations into
values ready for interpretation.

4.2.1. Pre-Processing

To obtain the ﬂux from an astronomical source, all
raw GIT exposures taken with a CCD imager have to
go through a set of generic steps before further image-
speciﬁc processing. These include bias-subtraction,
ﬂat-ﬁelding using the bias and ﬂat frames obtained
on the same night, and cosmic-ray correction using
Astro-SCRAPPY (McCully & Tewes 2019) package. The
ﬁnal pre-processing step is to calculate the astromet-
ric solution to map pixel coordinates to sky coordinates,
using the solve-field oﬄine package of astrometry.net
(Lang et al. 2010).

4.2.2. Photometry

Upon pre-processing,

images are processed
the

8

sources are extracted using the SExtractor (Bertin &
Arnouts 1996). These sources are cross-matched with
PanSTARRS DR1 (Chambers et al. 2016) catalogue
through a VizieR query to obtain the zero-points of the
image. The brightness of sources is estimated using PSF
photometry on the source of interest. To perform PSF
photometry, we obtain the PSF proﬁle of the sources in
the image using the PSFEx package (Bertin 2011) and
convolve it with the source image to estimate the source
ﬂux. The instrumental magnitude thus obtained is cor-
rected using an earlier estimated zero-point to obtain
the standard magnitude of the source.

4.2.3. Image subtraction

In some instances, the source of interest lies embedded
inside their host galaxies, which makes it diﬃcult to per-
form accurate photometry on these objects due to host
contamination. Broadly, searching for new transients in
the image also requires image subtraction. Such spe-
ciﬁc images of interest (identiﬁed by a header ﬂag) go
through another set of data reduction steps in the form
of image subtraction and candidate search.

Image subtraction is a numeric method to subtract
a deeper reference image from the science image of in-
terest. The GIT Image subtraction pipeline is based on
the ZOGY algorithm (Zackay et al. 2016). Owing to the
relatively large FoV, we ﬁrst divide the processed image
into smaller cutouts to reduce the impact of PSF and
background variation across the image. Corresponding
Pan-STARRS DR1 (PS1) image cutouts are downloaded
as reference images using panstamps5. Astrometric un-
certainties in science and reference images are reduced
by a cross match of positions with Gaia Data Release 2
(Brown et al. 2018, Gaia DR2) catalogue. SWarp (Bertin
et al. 2002) is used to re-sample both science and refer-
ence images on the same astrometric grid to align their
position angles. The reference image is scaled in ﬂux to
the science image ﬂux level based on the local ratio of
pixel scales and the zero-point of images. Finally, the
re-sampled ﬂux-matched science and reference images,
the PSF model, the RMS images, and the astrometric
uncertainties are used as input to pyzogy (Guevel &
Hosseinzadeh 2017) to obtain the diﬀerence image and
to correspond to the statistics image (score image).

4.2.4. Transient search

A vast majority of GIT observations are performed in
“targeted mode”, typically having a single source of in-
terest for photometry. However, for certain science goals
like searching for poorly localised GRB afterglows and

GW events counterpart searches, GIT undertakes “tiled
mode” observations acquiring multiple contiguous im-
ages covering the sky region to which the transient has
been coarsely localised. We run the image subtraction
pipeline on these tiled mode observations. A subsequent
pipeline with human-in-the-loop vetting is used for iden-
tifying transients in the subtracted images. We provide
a very short overview here, and for details, refer the
reader to Kumar et al. (in prep). Transient candidates
are identiﬁed by locating the position of local peaks in
the “score” image with scorr value > 5. Among these,
most of these detected candidates (> 99%) are spuri-
ous and ﬁltered out by the candidates vetting pipeline.
Finally, the remaining candidates are scanned by hu-
mans for veriﬁcation. The interesting candidates thus
obtained (if any) are further followed up to measure their
evolution in time.

4.2.5. Processing non-sidereal data

The primary objective of non-sidereal observations
with GIT is to report accurate astrometry and pho-
tometry of NEOs to MPC to reduce their orbital un-
certainties. Images acquired in non-sidereal mode show
all stars as streaks, with the target object ideally seen
as a point source. We have developed another special
pipeline to process such data: “Astrometry with Streak-
ing Stars” (Astreaks; Sharma et al. 2021c). Astreaks
identiﬁes all the streaks in the image, generates an equiv-
alent synthetic image with point sources and solves it for
astrometry using standard astrometry packages6. As-
trometry obtained using this pipeline results in sub-
arcsecond Observed − Computed residuals. Along with
observations of Fast Moving objects, we have also done
follow-ups of multiple cometary outburst events. The
aperture photometry of comets with centring is fully
automated, given the aperture size. The GIT pipeline
is also equipped with track-and-stack software designed
to stack the data of moving targets, thus helping with
better analysis of cometary features by improving the
SNR. The detailed working of Astreaks is discussed in
K. Sharma et al. (in prep).

4.3. Observation reports and data archiving

GIT pipeline has been designed to produce standard-
ised data products. The images obtained after the entire
processing have standard headers and do not require any
additional knowledge about GIT by users. Data process-
ing is logged and reported on slack in real-time, which
helps in debugging the unprecedented processing errors

of ﬁrst-order debugging. If the system encounters any
problems which it cannot ﬁx, it alerts observers via mes-
sages or phone calls through the various bots (§3.4).

We quantify the telescope performance in two eﬃ-
ciency parameters. The ﬁrst is the “on-sky eﬃciency”:
the fraction of the night (deﬁned by nautical twilight)
that was spent acquiring target images. Thus, even nec-
essary operations like readout and slew are considered
as extraneous in this deﬁnition. GIT currently operates
with typical nightly eﬃciencies of (cid:38) 80%. We also deﬁne
an “eﬀective eﬃciency”, where we include the readout
time as part of the exposure. In this case, the “eﬀec-
tive ineﬃciency” arises from weather, technical issues,
or slews (which can be optimised to some extent). On
good observing nights, eﬀective eﬃciencies as high as
94% have been achieved (Figure 4).
In contrast, the
median eﬀective eﬃciency in manual mode operations
was around 30%. Part of this can be attributed to the
upgrades and testing that were a key feature of man-
ual operations.
In semi-automated mode, median ef-
fective eﬃciency rose to ∼ 60%. The highest eﬃcien-
cies in manual or semi-automated nights were attained
during campaigns where we monitor a single target for
most of the night. This drastically reduced the need
for telescope or dome slews or any human intervention
in general. Overall, the best eﬃciencies are obtained in
fully automated observations. Figure 4 shows the clear
increase in telescope utilisation eﬃciency from manual
to semi-automated and ﬁnally to fully automated obser-
vations. The low-eﬃciency tails of the semi- and fully-
automated observations arise from partial nights lost to
weather problems and to occasional technical issues.

5.2. Sensitivity

GIT has good sensitivity, with a typical depth of
∼ 20.5–21 magnitudes in 10-minute g(cid:48) and r(cid:48) expo-
sures. The typical full-width at half-maximum for point
sources in GIT data is ∼ 3(cid:48)(cid:48). Figure 5.3 shows the 5-
sigma limiting magnitudes of GIT images for various
ﬁlters for data obtained between July 2021 to Dec 2021.
The median limiting magnitude is 20.44 in g(cid:48) and 20.49
r(cid:48) bands for data obtained on ±5 days of the new moon.
u(cid:48) and z(cid:48) band images are typically shallower due to a
combination of attenuation, reﬂectivity, camera sensitiv-
ity, and background. The faintest magnitude achieved
with a 120-minute co-add in the r(cid:48) band was ∼ 22.9.
In all bands, data obtained within ±5 days of the full
moon are relatively shallower by up to two magnitudes
due to the brighter sky background. Very shallow im-
ages in Figure 5.3, with a limiting magnitude around 16,
are ones acquired under very poor observing conditions,
like partial clouds.

Figure 4. GROWTH-India Telescope eﬃciencies during
each phase of operations. Three histograms show the eﬃcien-
cies for manual mode (blue), semi-automated mode (orange)
and automated mode (green). The system is currently run-
ning in automated mode with a typical eﬃciency of ∼ 80%,
which is a noticeable improvement over the manual and semi-
automated mode of observations. The low eﬀacing tail in au-
tomated mode is due to unsuitable weather conditions and
instrument failures.

and tracking live-time processing progress. All raw and
processed data are archived in a Network Attached Stor-
age (NAS) at IIT Bombay. Key data properties are also
stored in a local queryable database which is populated
right after the completion of processing of each image.

5. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE

5.1. On-sky eﬃciency

GIT received its ﬁrst light during the commissioning
phase in June 2018. At commissioning, the telescope
and camera system were operated in manual mode,
with remote and local operators sharing responsibilities.
Since then, the system has been upgraded in a phased
manner. In Feb 2019, the system was upgraded into the
semi-automated mode, where scripts managed the bulk
of operations. However, a few tasks like dome opera-
tions, calibration frames acquisition, and system mon-
itoring were handled by operators at the observatory.
In Sept. 2021, GIT was upgraded to a fully automated
mode.

In the course of typical operations, the control soft-
ware handles all responsibilities, including acquiring cal-
ibration images, calculating the observing schedule from
the master target list, ﬁlter changes, target acquisition
and tracking, operating the dome, ﬁlter wheel, camera,
etc. For absolute safety, the control software does not
have the capability to operate the dome or telescope
shutters: these are the only operations that require the
physical presence of the observing assistant at the start
and end of the observing program. The control software
monitors various diagnostic parameters and is capable

5.3. Photometric accuracy

GIT images are calibrated by cross-matching the stars
from the same ﬁeld against the Pan-STARRS Data Re-
lease 1 (DR1; Chambers et al. 2016) for the g(cid:48) r(cid:48) i(cid:48) z(cid:48)
bands, and the SDSS DR12 catalogue (Alam et al. 2015)
for u(cid:48) data. To check the reliability of photometric cal-
ibration for g(cid:48) r(cid:48) i(cid:48) z(cid:48) bands, we selected observations
obtained on several dark nights (new moon ±5 days),
with airmass < 1.1 and exposure time 300 s. For the u(cid:48)
band, we used a stacked image of 600 s. In all bands,
we limited the analysis to stars with a signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratio > 10. The photometric accuracy for vari-
ous bands is plotted against the magnitudes of stars in
Figure 5. Further, we derived photometric transforma-
tion equations between the GIT ﬁlter system and SDSS
/ Pan-STARRS ﬁlters. These transformation equations
were obtained using a set of isolated stars in GIT images
and reference catalogues. The transformation equations
for Pan-STARRS and SDSS catalogues are listed below.
Transformations from Pan-STARRS to GIT magni-
tudes:

g(cid:48)
GIT = gPS − 0.0051 ∗ (gPS − rPS) + 0.0001, σ = 0.0067
r(cid:48)
GIT = rPS + 0.0016 ∗ (gPS − rPS) − 0.0066, σ = 0.0165
r(cid:48)
GIT = rPS − 0.0085 ∗ (iPS − rPS) − 0.0080, σ = 0.0178
i(cid:48)
GIT = iPS + 0.0091 ∗ (iPS − rPS) + 0.0023, σ = 0.0133
i(cid:48)
GIT = iPS − 0.0158 ∗ (iPS − zPS) − 0.0034, σ = 0.0252
z(cid:48)
GIT = zPS − 0.0408 ∗ (iPS − zPS) − 0.0100, σ = 0.0159

Transformations from SDSS to GIT magnitudes:

u(cid:48)
GIT = uSDSS − 0.0168 ∗ (gSDSS − uSDSS) + 0.1044, σ = 0.0565
g(cid:48)
GIT = gSDSS − 0.1486 ∗ (gSDSS − rSDSS) + 0.0361, σ = 0.0378
g(cid:48)
GIT = gSDSS − 0.0719 ∗ (uSDSS − gSDSS) + 0.0383, σ = 0.0389
r(cid:48)
GIT = rSDSS − 0.0077 ∗ (gSDSS − rSDSS) + 0.0032, σ = 0.0104
r(cid:48)
GIT = rSDSS + 0.0021 ∗ (iSDSS − rSDSS) − 0.0023, σ = 0.0071
i(cid:48)
GIT = iSDSS + 0.0091 ∗ (iSDSS − rSDSS) + 0.0119, σ = 0.0194
i(cid:48)
GIT = iSDSS − 0.0132 ∗ (iSDSS − zSDSS) − 0.0030, σ = 0.0224
z(cid:48)
GIT = zSDSS − 0.0251 ∗ (iSDSS − zSDSS) + 0.0167, σ = 0.0165

The higher colour term for the g(cid:48) transformation
is consistent with the PanSTARRs – SDSS hyper-
calibration (Finkbeiner et al. 2016).

6. SCIENCE RESULTS

The primary science goals for GIT are 1) The study
of fast transients like gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) af-
terglows, electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational
wave sources, fast radio bursts, fast blue optical tran-
sients, etc. 2) Follow up of supernovae (SN) and No-
vae from very early to late phases, 3) The study and

characterisation of solar system objects like Near Earth
Asteroids, active asteroids, comets, etc.). In addition,
the fourth goal of GIT is education — through courses,
workshops, student training, etc. The last few years
have been very productive for GIT in terms of the sci-
entiﬁc outcomes, aided by its robotic capabilities. Since
commissioning, GIT has followed up a good number of
SN, Novae, GRB afterglows, EMGW candidates from
GW merger events, near-Earth objects and comets. Fur-
ther, we performed the transient search observation for
suitable events like Fermi GRBs with small localisation
uncertainty, and GW event tiled follow-up, etc. The
results from these observations are summarised in the
following section:

6.1. Afterglows of Gamma-Ray Bursts

GRBs have been the subject of great interest in the
last two decades in astronomy. The afterglows of GRB
arise due to the interaction of the jet with the surround-
ing medium at longer wavelengths than γ-rays. GRB op-
tical afterglows are fast transients evolving on timescales

of hours to days (Piran & Granot 2001). GIT’s au-
tonomous operations and fast response time make these
events a compelling science case for GIT. Since the ﬁrst
follow-up of such events in Dec 2018 (Srivastava et al.
2018), GIT has followed up > 70 GRB events with 20
detections and put constraints on optical brightness of
> 50 events. Figure 6 shows the comparison of GRB af-
terglow detections followed up by GIT to the Swift GRB
optical afterglow population (Kann et al. 2011). We see
that GIT has obtained dense sampling of several GRBs
(see for instance Kumar et al. 2022), and that the af-
terglow candidates studied by GIT show similar fading
characteristics as the broader sample of Swift GRBs.

Most of the GRB afterglows (> 75%) were followed
up within the ﬁrst night from the trigger with a me-
dian response time of 0.55 days (including waiting for
sunset). Our fastest turnaround time was 17 mins for
GRB 210722A. Further, the independent discovery of
the afterglow within the ﬁrst hour of image acquisi-
tion for the GRB 200524A was one of the key high-
lights of the GRB follow-up eﬀort. We did detailed

while the right panel shows the thermonuclear SNe. For SN 2019vxm and SN 2019tua, GIT has missed the peak, and we show
the early light curves of SN 1996cb (Qiu et al. 1999) and SN 2005ip (Stritzinger et al. 2012) to understand their possible type.
GIT has complemented Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) surveys in some phases. For some SNe like SN 2021do and SN 2021gmj,
we show the light curves in the ZT F − r band (Bellm et al. 2019).

follow-ups and analysis for a few other GRBs, includ-
ing GRB 190114C, GRB 190530A, and GRB 210204A.
The popular GRB 190114C detected at sub-TeV ener-
gies by MAGIC Telescope (Mirzoyan et al. 2019), was
extensively follow-up with GIT and results were pub-
lished in Misra et al. (2021). Results from the analysis
of GRB 190530A were recently published in Gupta et al.
(2022) where we probed into the emission mechanisms
of this GRB. Another interesting GRB 210204A which
showed deviations from typical synchrotron-driven af-
terglow emission at late times was followed up by GIT
in coordination with other Indian facilities like HCT,
DOT, and DFOT. A detailed study of this GRB was
published in (Kumar et al. 2022).

6.2. Supernovae

GIT has followed up over 30 SNe of all types based
on their visibility. GIT can be triggered immediately
after discovery and has the capability to follow up to
very late phases ( > 300 days). Very well-sampled light
curves have been obtained for key targets. In Figure 7
we show r(cid:48)-band light curves of a sample of core-collapse
and thermonuclear SNe. GIT has often followed up pe-
culiar events, which can yield high scientiﬁc returns. For
instance, SN 2018hna — an SN 1987A like explosion
with shock breakout and of blue supergiant progenitor

— has been studied in detail in Singh et al. (2019) (Fig-
ure 7, left). A type Iax event, SN 2020sck, has been
studied in Dutta et al. (2022). One-dimensional radia-
tive transfer modeling of SN 2020sck (Figure 7, right)
has shown the explosion to be a pure deﬂagration in a
carbon-oxygen white dwarf.

In the left panel of Figure 7, we show GIT data
with solid symbols, complemented with publicly avail-
able data in open symbols.
For the type-II event
SN 2021gmj, GIT data covered a crucial decline phase.
The Ic event SN 2021mxx was covered through its peak,
while SN 2021do was observed from the peak onwards.
SN 2019vxm and SN 2019tua have been followed up
mostly in the late phases. To understand the types of
these events, we compare the early phase light curve
of SN 2019tua with a type IIb event SN 1996cb (Qiu
et al. 1999). Similarly, for SN 2019vxm, we compare
with type IIn event SN 2005ip (Stritzinger et al. 2012).
GIT has complemented surveys like the Zwicky Tran-
sient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al. 2019) in some phases of
evolution of a few objects and can be instrumental in fol-
lowing up in crucial phases of transient evolution. In the
right panel of Figure 7, we show GIT r-band lightcurves
for four thermonuclear supernovae. A paper combining
SN 2021wuf and SN 2019np is under preparation.

6.3. Novae

GIT has observed several novae, both galactic and
extra-galactic. We have monitored the outbursts of the
remarkable recurrent nova in M31 — M31N2008-12a —
in 2018 (Srivastav et al. 2018), 2020, and 2021 (Basu
et al. 2021). We have monitored the 2021 outburst of
the Galactic recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi, as well as sev-
eral classical novae, including V1674 Her, AT 2021ypn,
and AT 2022uz (or M31N2022-01a). Monitoring novae
in M31 has even led to a serendipitous observation of
the classical nova, AT2022cpe, as early as an hour from
the time of discovery (Basu et al. 2022).

6.4. Electromagnetic Counterparts of Gravitational

Wave events (EMGW)

(second BNS merger

GIT extensively followed up EMGW events dur-
ing the third observation run (O3) Ligo-Virgo Col-
laboration (LVC), which began in April 2019 (Ab-
bott et al. 2021). The ﬁrst phase of O3 (aka O3a),
which lasted until the end of September,
resulted
in the detection of 6 Binary Neutron star (BNS)
and 9 Black Hole - Neutron star merger candidates
(BHNS)7 (Abbott et al. 2021). Among these, six events:
GW190425/S190425z
event),
GW190426 152155/S190426c, GW190814/S190814bv,
S190901ap, S190910d, S190910h were followed by GIT.
For all but the S190426c event, GIT primarily followed
up interesting candidates at the early times of their
evolution. The photometric follow-up played an im-
portant role in eliminating the non-interesting candi-
dates in search of counterparts of GW events (Kasli-
wal et al. 2020). Preliminary results of the follow-
up were published in the form of GCN circulars (Ku-
mar et al. 2019b,a; Waratkar et al. 2019a,b; Bhalerao
et al. 2019a,b), and detailed analyses were undertaken in
collaboration with GROWTH partners (Kasliwal et al.
2020; Coughlin et al. 2019). For the ‘S190426c’ event,
we worked in close collaboration with Zwicky Tran-
sient Facility (Bellm 2014, ZTF) and Dark Energy Cam-
era (Flaugher et al. 2015, DECam) on Blanco Telescope
to tile up a signiﬁcant sky area (22.1 deg2 area contain-
ing 17.5% localisation probability) multiple times during
the span of ∼ 10 days. No viable candidate counterpart
was detected in GIT follow-up observations. However,
the upper limits obtained from follow-up observations
helped put stringent constraints on ejecta masses from
putative KNe (Kumar et al., in prep).

6.5. Solar System Objects

GIT has an active follow-up observation program for
Near-Earth Objects to reﬁne their orbital parameters.
To date, GIT has observed over one hundred NEOs with
absolute magnitude up to H ≤ 27.78. Due to the high
proper motion (3.6 − 120(cid:48)(cid:48)/min), all the NEOs were ob-
served with non-sidereal tracking.

GIT has been used to study seven periodic and sixteen
non-periodic comets. We have reported the cometary
activity of four non-periodic comets: C/2021 A6 (Bul-
ger et al. 2020), C/2021 C1 (Rankin et al. 2020), C/2021
C3 (Pruyne et al. 2021), Comet C/2021 E3 (Bolin et al.
2021). In addition to the expected variation in bright-
ness with the geocentric and heliocentric distances, a
few comets showed outbursts i.e., short-term ﬂare-up in
luminosity (Hughes 1975). We undertook photometric
follow-up of several cometary outbursts discovered by
ZTF for conﬁrmation of the event and further follow-

(6478) Gault, an active asteroid (originally designated
as 1998 JC1) is dynamically a main-belt asteroid with
Tisserand parameter with respect to Jupiter (TJ ) = 3.46
(Ye et al. 2019). In June 2020, we participated in co-
ordinated observations with the GROWTH network to
constrain its rotation period and understand its activity
mechanism. With the help of coordinated observations,
we measured a rotation period of ∼ 2.5 hour (Purdum
et al. 2021), which is the critical rotation period of a
body of the size of Gault.
It was concluded that the
activity of Gault was due to surface mass shedding from
its fast rotation spun up by the Yarkovsky-O’Keefe-
Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) eﬀect (Bottke Jr et al.
2006; Kleyna et al. 2019).

6.6. Fast transients

A key component of GIT science involves

the
follow-up of rare,
fast transients. One such event
was AT2020xnd/ZTF20acigmel (the “Camel”), which
evolved very fast, similar to the AT2018cow (the “cow”)
event (Perley et al. 2019).
The candidate main-
tained a high photospheric temperature even at a later
stage of its evolution and with the absence of a sec-
ond radioactive peak (Perley et al. 2021). We per-
formed late-time deep follow-up in coordination with
ZTF and Liverpool optical telescope (LT). The de-
tailed analysis of this event was published in (Perley

et al. 2021). GIT followed up another interesting event
AT2019pim/ZTF19abvizsw (Ho et al. 2020) during Oct
2019. The candidate showed properties similar to an af-
terglow of a GRB. However, no GRB was detected for
this event by high-energy monitors. The study of this
orphan afterglow candidate is in progress and will soon
be published in Perley et al. (in prep).

7. SUMMARY

GROWTH-India Telescope is India’s ﬁrst robotic tele-
scope, located in Hanle. The telescope has been dedi-
cated to time-domain astronomy since its commission-
ing in the summer of 2018. After starting its operation
in manual mode for a few months, the system was up-
graded in a phased manner to semi-automated mode and
ﬁnally to an automated mode in September 2021. These
upgrades signiﬁcantly increased the telescope’s “on-sky
eﬃciency” to > 85%. The automated bots handle mon-
itoring of the system in real-time and inform the core

team of live-time observing updates and errors in case
of automatic debug failure.

GIT has contributed to the time domain astronomy in
the last few years by follow-up of EMGW events, GRBs,
SNe, Novae, and NEOs. More than 30 core-collapse and
thermonuclear SNe have been followed up in the last
three years of observations. We have detected 20 GRB
optical afterglows and provided useful constraints on the
optical brightness of > 50 GRB afterglows. We have per-
formed an extensive follow-up of GW events from the
O3 run of the advanced gravitational wave detector net-
work, where we chose interesting candidates for follow-
up and helped rule them out based on their evolution.
During this run, we undertook an extensive transient
search operation for S190426c that covered > 17.5% of
the total localisation probability, which eventually con-
strained the mass ejection models for KNe. Follow-up
of NEOs is a regular objective for GIT, where we have
observed more than a hundred near-earth objects and
discovered/co-discovered four comet outbursts.

In addition to science, GIT has also been used for
education — an important goal of the GROWTH net-
work. The ﬁrst international GROWTH school was con-
ducted in India, including a live remote observing ses-
sion at GIT9. The telescope contributes greatly to stu-
dent training via courses, research projects, as well as
undergraduate and graduate theses.

GIT’s automated operations and remarkable observ-
ing eﬃciency give it a unique place in Indian astronomy.
In the near future, we are exploring various upgrades
to operations, data processing, and hardware to further
enhance the observatory’s performance. Equipped with
these, GIT will continue to play an important role in
time-domain astrophysics.
