Multiplayer online games are ideal settings for studying the effects of technological disruptions on social
behavior. Software patches to online games cause significant changes to the game’s rules and require players to
develop new strategies to cope with these disruptions. We surveyed players, analyzed the content of software
patch notes, and analyzed changes to the character selection behaviors in more than 53 million matches of Dota
2 in the days before and after software patches over a 30-month period. We found that the severity of patches
is correlated with the magnitude of behavioral changes following a patch. We discuss the opportunities of
leveraging software patches to online games as a valuable but overlooked empirical instrument for measuring
behavioral dynamics.

INTRODUCTION
How do software patches impact the behavior of users? Online games are highly interoperable
systems that require on-going maintenance for security, usability, balance, and new features [11].
The release of a software patch is necessarily disruptive as hardware systems need to be rebooted,
software dependencies need to be refreshed, user routines need to be revised, and documentation
needs to be updated. In most software systems, users pay little attention to patched beyond
interacting with notificationss [8, 22, 60]: they generally do not read change logs, index their
experience around version numbers, or create or engage with social media content. However, the
experience of software patches in online game communities is significantly different. Players index
their experience using patch notes, actively lobby for and organize against changes, and produce
social content both in anticipation of and in reaction to software patches.

Multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs) like League of Legends (LoL) and Defense of the Ancients
2 (Dota 2) are ideal settings to examine the effects of software patches on user behavior for several
reasons [4, 27]. First, MOBA players consciously change their behavior in response to patches in
order to remain competitive: this gives us a credible and exogenous mechanism to understand the
causal relationship between patches and behavior. Second, MOBA games contain public, detailed,
and longitudinal records of within-subject behavior: this enables us to compare player behavior

before and after patches. Third, historical records about the timing and content of the patches are
well-documented: this variation in patches could explain variation in players’ in-game behavior.
Finally, players are often very active in online communities participating in online discussions,
so it is feasible to recruit for surveys or interviews. However, the relationship between software
patches as a site of technological change and the effects of these changes on post-patch behavior in
a globalized gaming culture remain poorly understood.

This papers explores how players’ character selection behavior is temporarily disrupted following
a patch and how the magnitude of this behavioral change varies with the “severity” of the patch’s
changes. First, we surveyed Dota 2 players to understand how they change their in-game behaviors
following software patches. Second, we developed a “patch severity index” using a combination of
survey data and patch note content to quantify the magnitude of a patch’s changes. Third, we used
a public dataset of Dota 2 players’ character selections over a 36-month period of time to measure
changes in character selection behavior around patches. Our survey results confirm that players
in-game behaviors are strongly influenced by software patches, there is significant variation in
the “severity” of the changes introduced by software patches, there are significant but temporary
disruptions in players’ character selection behavior around the patches, and the scale of these
disruptions are strongly correlated with severity of patches.

BACKGROUND

Multiplayer online battle arenas
Team-based multiplayer online games offer many benefits for research about social behavior, making
them potentially better empirical settings into team processes outside of laboratories [21, 64, 68].
Multiplayer online battle areas (MOBAs) like League of Legend and Dota 2 are one of the most
popular genres of multiplayer online games. In the canonical game mode, ten players of similar skill
levels will be paired together into two teams of five players. Over the course of an approximately
20–45 minute match, each player controls a single character1 that accumulates experience and
gold from destroying enemy buildings, characters, and non-player characters. The experience is
redeemed by leveling up new abilities and gold is redeemed by purchasing items augmenting or
complementing their characters’ abilities. The match ends when one team’s base is destroyed or
one team resigns. Before the game starts, players go through a drafting phase where they pick and
ban characters out of more than 100 available choices. Drafting plays a significant role in MOBA as
it determines every player’s roles the team’s overall strategy, and is critical for the team’s success.
In a MOBA setting like Dota 2, characters vary significantly in their abilities, which allows them to
fulfill different roles such as damage dealers (“carries”), damage takers (“tanks”), and specialists
(“supports”).

MOBAs like Dota 2 exhibit high levels of decision complexity for players: differentiated character
roles requires strong coordination, discretion in executing in-game tasks requires trust, and the
mutual observability of team designs requires strategic meta-cognition. Previous work has looked at
team composition strategies [26, 33, 53], team behavior pattern mining [20, 39, 67], and the impact of
the metagame [18, 19, 47]. Role specialization as well as other pre- and in-game tactics like situational
awareness and meta-cognition about opponents are referred to as a “meta-game” [18, 19, 32].
Changes like adding new characters, changing existing characters’ abilities, or altering the map
cause change incentives, tactics, and other relationships throughout the game.

1We use the terms “heroes” and “characters” interchangeably for the in-game agents that players select and control.

Characterizing disruptions in online gaming behavior following software patches

3

Software patches
Patches have always been a tool for software developers to fix security vulnerabilities, provide im-
provement and add new features to existing software infrastructures [16]. Video game development
differs from other software development in many ways [2, 3, 37, 40, 45, 46]. The developers of mas-
sively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) and multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs) engage
in an on-going process of “balancing” to ensure characters do not become over- or under-powered
and reduce the fairness of competitiveness of matches [17, 38]. Software patches increase (“buff”)
or decrease (“nerf”) the power of existing characters’ and items’ abilities as the game developers
strive to achieve a “balance”. Patches introduce new characters and items, and alter other features
such as the map, non-player characters, or experience and economy mechanics [13, 27, 31].

While the official patch notes are dry technical communication, they are still actively framed by
developers [43, 57]. The power to require users to install developer updates to access a community
is a form of “protocological power” making games highly contingent commodities [61]. Game
developers are required to engage in an on-going process of data collection and monitoring in
order to use their power to unilaterally introduce changes to an experience millions of people are
invested in to responsibly govern community values like fairness [12, 41]. Software developers can
face the resistance from their user communities when releasing patches, which can sometimes lead
to coordinated campaigns on social media platforms [1] and negative reviews on app stores [24].
In addition to their technical component, software patches in online games are also settings for
social behavior like anticipation, deliberation, and sensemaking. Before a patch is released, players
lobby developers for changes through social media, speculate about the content and timing of
the release, and even write-up fake patch notes for humorous or trolling purposes. Players create
hours-long YouTube videos interpreting the patch changes line-by-line, players reference different
epochs of in-game experience using patch numbers, and platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Twitch
are flooded with commentary about the patch [9]. This is perhaps captured most vividly by players
of multiplayer online game indexing their experience playing the game over time through release
numbers (e.g., “Back in 6.89...”). Because software patches introduce many changes to the game,
they disrupt players’ knowledge, strategies, and behaviors and require them to adapt and improvise
new alternatives following a patch. These problems are non-trivial to solve because of the multiple
dimensions and complex interactions among characters’ abilities and roles, game mechanics, and
players’ meta-strategies [18, 19].

Hypotheses
Players’ behavior in the aftermath of a patch should capture the traces of their problem solving
processes as they discover, adapt, and emulate strategies. Prior research has analyzed changes in
character usage and banning behavior following patches [29, 47, 62, 69]. This research used League
of Legends as an empirical setting, a game that employs a “freemium” business model where players
have to purchase characters in order to play them. In contrast, all characters are free-to-play for
players in Dota 2, which ensures that players can freely select any character following a patch.
Using Dota 2 as empirical setting removes an important confounder in explaining how players’
character selection tactics are affected by software patches: the availability of all characters to all
players before and after a patch in Dota 2 enables us to measure the effects of a patch on both the
patched characters (where post-patch changes in behavior are expected) as well as in un-patched
characters (where post-patch changes in behavior are emergent).

Because of the difficulties of understanding the space of all solutions and the strong incentive
to remain competitive against other players, there are many lines of inquiry to explore with
patched-induced behavioral changes. We focus on changes in character selection behavior because

Zhang and Keegan

survey respondents (see Table 1) indicated this was one of the most common behavioral changes.
We make two hypotheses about the main effects of players’ character selection behavior in the
aftermath of software patches. First, players are likely to employ strategies that produce “good
enough” strategies: we expect to see the diversity of players’ character selection behaviors decrease
significantly in the aftermath of a path as they resort to risk-averse strategies. Second, patches
with more changes will introduce more uncertainty into this complex information space than a
patch with fewer changes. We expect that the magnitude of the behavioral changes will vary with
the disruptiveness of a patch: more “severe” patches should cause greater post-patch behavioral
changes than less “severe” patches.

METHODS

Log data description
We collected our in-game match data from two sources: (1) a data dump released by Opendota.com
which contains 1,191,768,403 matches dated up to March 2016 [15] and (2) log data from March
2016 to July 2016 from Dota 2’s official API [58]. We only selected matches played in games modes
where there is no system randomization on character picking strategy: “All pick”, “Captain’s Mode”,
“Ranked Matchmaking”, and “Compendium Matchmaking”. Examples of game modes we excluded
include “All Random”, in which each player gets assigned a random hero, and “Single Draft”, in
which each player can only choose from three random characters. We filtered the data to analyze
all matches played 30 days before and after each major patch. The final dataset contains 532,057,466
matches, spanning from patch 6.78 (May 2013) to patch 6.88 (June 2016). While player skill level
is reported in the data after May 2015, it was not capture beforehand, thus omitting a 7 of the 11
patch events in our time frame. Because reconstructing and validating players’ historical skill levels
around patches would computationally expensive and difficult to validate, we do not stratify our
research design by skill level and only report aggregate results across all skills. Other meta-data
includes the unique match ID, the game mode, the start time of the match, the ten players’ IDs,
each player’s team assignment, and each player’s character selection.

Survey
In addition to the in-game match data, we deployed a survey to the Dota 2 online community
inquiring about players’ patch-related behavior. Following approval by our institutional review
board as well as community moderators, the survey was advertised through Reddit, Twitter and
Discord servers. After soliciting responses for two weeks, incomplete and spam responses were
filtered out, and we had a total of 449 valid responses. Our sample shows an extreme gender bias
mirroring general demographics in MOBAs [49, 50]: 96.4% of the survey participants identified
as male, 1.6% identified as female and 0.9% identified as gender diverse. Most participants were
below 35 years old: 59.6% participants indicated that they are 18 to 24 years old and 36.3% are 25
to 34 years old. 88.8% of participants have spent more than 1000 hours in the game Dota 2 and
66.2% have been playing the game since 2014. In addition to demographic questions, the survey
asked respondents about their history and experience of playing Dota 2, their information seeking
behavior following a patch, the importance they assign to different kinds of changes in patches,
and their character picking and play strategies before and after patches. We report out the survey
results in the context of other findings in the Results section below.

Character selection behavior
Patches introduce changes along multiple dimensions of an already complex and multidimensional
decision space. Character selection is a crucial step in the experience of playing the game and poor

team assembly decisions can severely reduce performance, cohesion, and likelihood of winning [32,
34, 55, 59]. Because the vast majority of players (89.5%) in our survey reported changing their
character selection behaviors following patches (Table 1), we prioritized character selection as
the primary behavior to analyze for disruptions around software patches. There are many other
kinds of patch-induced behavioral changes that could be detected using the match data (items,
character combinations, game length, kills/deaths/assists, etc.) and there are good reasons to suspect
these changes vary across social categories (skill, geography, etc). Given the limitations of the data
described above for segmenting the users into these categories, we were not able to explore these
additional features and only report out results aggregated across the entire population of matches
in this time frame. We describe opportunities for exploring other patch-induced behavioral changes
in the Discussion section.

To measure these patch-induced behavioral changes, we condensed character selection behavior
into daily aggregated frequency vectors for 30 days before and after each major patch. We chose
this 30-day window before and after a patch to establish a baseline for character selection behaviors
and then the measure whether and how long it takes for character selection behavior to stabilize
following the patch as players converge on new meta-strategies. In other words, we expect that
any behavioral changes caused by the patch should have stabilized by 30 days after the patch. For
each major patch from 6.78 to 6.88, we constructed a matrix 𝑀 of days and characters: 𝑀𝑖 𝑗 is the
number of times character 𝑗 is picked on the 𝑖𝑡ℎ day, where 𝑖 ∈ [−30, 30] around the patch release
and 𝑗 ∈ [1, 102] for the number of unique characters in the game. For new characters that were
added later into the game through patches, they have a pick count of 0 for the patches that they
were not present.

and Δ𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒

Cosine similarity. Cosine similarity is used to measure similarities between two non-zero vectors.
We used cosine similarity to determine the similarity of the aggregated daily draft vectors compared
to the draft vector 30 days after a patch. The Δ𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒
values are the differences in the
𝑡 −1
cosine similarities of player selections the day immediately before and after (respectively) the
patch compared to 30 days after the patch (see Figure 1). Δ𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒
captures the change in character
selection behavior from the day immediately prior to the patch to 30 days after the patch. Δ𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒
captures the change in character selection behavior immediately following a patch. Low similarity
scores mean that players’ character selection behavior was substantially different than 30 days
after the patch. We constructed character pick matrices for each of the 11 patches (6.78–6.88) and
calculated the similarity between each day’s draft for the 30 days before and after each patch. Note
that normalization of character selection is not necessary because the normalization terms will
cancel out per the formula of cosine similarity.

Gini coefficient. Gini coefficients the equality of player attention across characters. Gini coefficients
range from 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect equality (every character is picked with the same
frequency), and 1 represents perfect inequality (every player picks the same hero, which is impossible
in Dota 2 since players cannot pick the same character in a match). We constructed character pick
matrix for the 11 major patches (6.78 – 6.88), and we were able to generate 11 vectors of 61 values

𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 −1 value is the Gini coefficient of character selections the day immediately before a patch and
𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 +1 is the coefficient of character selections the day immediately following a patch. For example,
a decrease in cosine similarity and an increase in the Gini coefficient implies that even though
players’ strategies are becoming more diverse, these strategies still prioritize selecting from a small
set characters rather than across many characters. A decrease in the Gini coefficient implies that
players’ drafts are spread more evenly across the set of possible characters.

Patch severity index
A patch note is a document released by the game developers enumerating the specific changes made
since the previous version [4, 13, 27, 31, 43, 57]. In MOBAs like Dota 2 and LoL, these changes can
occur at multiple levels involving characters, items, maps, gameplay, and other features [27]. For
example, changing the location of a tree on the map does not have the same impact on a player’s
character selection behavior as changing the damage dealt by a hero. We define a “change” to be
a single instance of any one of these documented differences in developers patch notes. Because
some changes have a greater impact on gameplay than others, changes cannot be treated equally.
Some examples of patch changes are given in Table 2.

We propose a “Patch Severity Index” (PSI) a metric to quantify the magnitude of changes intro-
duced by a patch. We collected patch notes from liquipedia.net, a collaborative wiki documenting
patch changes among other game information. Patch notes on liquipedia.net originate from
the official patch notes released by the Dota 2 developer Valve but are converted to a consistent
formatting across patches by the community. We did a content analysis on the changes across the
11 patches in our sample (6.78 to 6.88) and came up with seven categories summarized in Table 3.

These categories reproduce similar themes founds in content analyses of patch note documents
for League of Legends [27]. A research assistant categorized all the changes in the patch notes into
seven categories based on the content of the changes. Since most of the patch notes are already
labeled, either on the official release, or the crowd-sourced liquipedia.net, all categories used
in the patch notes are consolidated into the seven categories in Table 3. We also counted the raw
number of bulleted changes in each patch as a coarse baseline of patch severity. However, for
character and item changes, we only count them once for each character and item regardless the
raw number of bulleted changes listed.

We constructed the PSI as the weighted sum of the changes introduced across categories. We
determined these weights from the survey respondents by asking them to distribute 100 points
among the seven categories based on their influence on gameplay (“Put more points in categories
that cause larger changes in your gameplay”). Figure 2 summarizes the results we received in the
survey responses. Because of skews in the distribution of respondents’ values, we used the median
reported values to determine the weights. The final PSI for each patch is calculated as the sum
of total number of changes in each category weighted by the median survey response for that
category. We normalized the final PSI for each patch against the patch with the highest PSI and the
result is shown in Table 4.

illustrate the frequencies of character selections one day before (blue) and after (orange) patch 6.86
and 6.88. In patch 6.86, many characters saw substantial increases in the frequency of play following
the patch (left pane of Figure 3). The increased interest in these characters among players following
a patch can be attributed in part to positive changes (“buffs”) introduced by the patch. For example
for the top five characters that saw the greatest increase, the most frequently-played character
post-patch, Arc Warden (113), is a newly-released hero. The characters with the biggest increase
in selection, Pudge (14), Zeus (22), Riki (32), and Sniper (35), can attributed buffs or reworked
abilities, both of which made them stronger and more exciting to play in the new patch. Some
characters saw a major decline in their frequency of play following the patch (right pane). The
decreased interest in these characters among players following a patch can also be attributed in
part to negative changes (“nerfs”) introduced by the patch. The five characters with the biggest
decrease in selection, Windranger (21), Shadow Fiend (11), Tusk (100), Slardar (28), and Queen of
Pain (39) all received explicit nerfs from the patch. Patch 6.88 brought less impactful changes on
character pick frequencies. Similar trends (but different characters) are observed for characters
with the biggest decrease in selection frequency in patch 6.88 as well.

Post-patch behavior around un-patched characters. Even though developers release patches intending
to produce behavioral changes in specific characters, sometimes the consequences of those changes
are difficult to predict and influence other parts of the game. Many of the characters who had
significant popularity changes were not patched. Zeus (22) and Sniper (35) were un-patched
characters but increased in popularity following patch 6.86. Often times, due to the synergies
among the 100+ characters, changes to one character can easily lead to a cascading effect on the
other character picks. What works well as counter-picks or synergy picks will not work any more.
Patch 6.86 also brought other types of changes such as a reworked game map, a new type of “rune”
that benefits certain characters greatly, reworked neutral creep abilities, some new or modified
items and a new game mode. These changes all have an implicit effect on pick rates of the characters
and possibly not only explain why we observed different magnitude of character pick changes in
patch 6.86 and 6.88, but also why the characters that are not directly impacted also see changes
in popularity. These examples demonstrate the difficulty of reliably mapping one individual or
even categories of patch updates to specific behavioral changes. This uncertainty with patches in
online games differentiates game patches from updates to other types of software systems where
the changes may narrower and more predictable outcomes.

Post-patch behavior in online communities. In addition to in-game behavioral changes, patches
also cause disruptions to the online communities of players on social media platforms. Players in

these community not only have access to the patch notes for them to reference and strategize their
character picks, but also have access to online forums and discussion boards where players come
together and talk about their thoughts on the new patch. For example, when patch 6.86 dropped
on December 16, 2015, the announcement post on Dota2 subreddit ‘r/dota2’ received more than
3,300 up-votes and 1,200 comments, far greater than the typical attention to other posts. Even for
the comparably smaller patch 6.88, the announcement post got similar levels of attention in the
community: more than 4,500 up-votes and 2,900 comments. In the comments of both announcement
posts, the most popular comments include topics that highlighting notable changes, discussing
potential impact the changes have and, of course, making new memes based on the changes. For
example, when patch 6.86 nerfed Winter Wyvern, one of the top comments read “Goodbye my
beautiful Winter Wyvern, you were strong and fun to play, but now you have to leave us... Good
night sweet princess :´(” and the comment was followed by many other redditors agreeing and
listing other characters that also received nerfs: “WW (Winter Wyvern) and Huskar holding hands
while walking to the dumpster.”

Besides humorous commentary, there were also serious discussions on what changes could
mean to the characters. For example, in patch 6.88, a character named Pugna received a small buff
on “intelligence growth” where one Reddit user commented: “...the int buff combined with the
change to int last patch would make his magic damage output a little higher, so maybe he’ll be a
bit more viable as a support?” Sometimes, the comments are both positive and negative, like the
top comment on patch 6.86 announcement post where a new hero, Arc Warden, was first added
into the game: “let the terrible reign of arc warden mis micro begin”, which both referred to the
temporary popularity of a new character with players of all skill levels and the difficulties players
may face when doing so, as the new character requires “micro”, a difficult skill involving controlling
multiple units simultaneously.

Changes in character selection behavior
Our first hypothesis predicted that character selection behavior should change significantly but
temporarily following a patch. We measured changes in the post-patch selection behavior of players
through two different constructs: the cosine similarity of players’ character selections and the Gini
coefficient of players’ character selections.

Cosine similarity. Figure 5 shows the changes in cosine similarity of character selections for the
11 patches in the 30 days before and after a patch (patch day is time 0). Before the release of the
patch, cosine similarity scores are stable for most patches except 6.82 and 6.83. This stability in
cosine similarity before the patch illustrates that character selection strategies were stable within
the community. One day after the release of a new patch, the cosine similarity for four patches
(6.80, 6.81, 6.82 and 6.86) saw an immediate drop: Δ𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒

(Table 4).

𝑡 +1

> Δ𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒
𝑡 −1

This sudden decrease in similarity implies that players explored new strategies by using different
character selections from before the patch but few of strategies survived by the end of the 30-day
post-patch window. This result can be explained by the nature of patches in Dota 2 as the changes
in one category can interact with other categories. For example, when a character gets buffed
directly but an item this character relies on gets nerfed, it is difficult to determine whether the
net effect on the character makes them stronger or weaker after the patch. As different players
explored different character selection strategies or followed influencers casting their own games,
some strategies turned out to work well and players would copy this strategy.

Tables 6 and 7 summarize survey responses related to team formation and character selection
behavior. For the 89.5% participants who indicated that they actively looked for information related
to patches including reading patch notes (Table 1), a majority of respondents agreed (16.5% “strongly

nerfed, I will want to try it in a game”. In addition, a super-majority of respondents agreed (24.8%
“strongly agree” and 53.1% “somewhat agree”) with the statement “I experiment with different
characters that are changed in this patch”.

There are some anomalies in Figure 5 unrelated to patch-related behavioral changes. For example,
around 25 days after the release of 6.79 (orange), the cosine similarity went down significantly,
which was possibly caused by a server problem in-game where many regions ran out of servers and
games could not be played. Another anomaly happened 20 days before the release of 6.82 (purple)
possibly related to a major tournament, which can also led to fewer games played. We can rule out
these anomalies being caused by other patches during the observation window based on the dates
of patches. These anomalies follow a similar shape as patch-induced disruptions and suggest that
patches are not the only mechanism that disrupt players’ character selection behavior.

Gini coefficient. Figure 6 shows the changes in Gini coefficients of character selection for all 11
patches in the 30 days before and after a patch (patch day is time 0). The Gini coefficient captures
whether characters are getting equal attention from players’ selection behavior. Gini coefficients
stayed stable for most of the patches except 6.82 and 6.83. Seven patches (6.79, 6.80, 6.81, 6.82, 6.84,
6.85, 6.86 and 6.87) saw an increase in the Gini coefficient immediately after a new patch.

Since patch notes detailing each change will be published with the release of the patches, players
could be reading the changes and focusing playing the stronger characters. Out of the 98.9% survey
participants who follow patch notes, 84.2% either strongly agree or somewhat agree that they are
more likely to ban buffed characters and 87.5% agree to some extent they are more likely to play
buffed characters. In addition, 66.7% agree they are less likely to ban a nerfed character and 64.2%
agree to some extent that they are less likely to play a nerfed character. These survey responses
provide context for why players change their character selection behavior in response to patches.
If cosine similarities go down and Gini coefficients go up after a patch, it means that players are
picking different characters in games and some characters are getting picked more often. If cosine

similarities increase immediately after a new patch, it means that players’ strategies are starting to
converge to the stabilized strategies. Patch changes can be very straightforward to understand, so
it requires less experimentation from players to reach their final strategies.

Pick strategy changes. The analysis above shows while the cosine similarities and Gini coefficients
changed immediately after the patch, they do stabilize over time. To further understand how
behavior changes happen and why they happen, we asked survey participants to describe their
drafting strategies in two scenarios: routine drafting (“Which of the following statements best
describe your hero picking strategy in general?”) versus post-patch drafting (“Which of the following
statements best describe your hero picking strategy after a patch?”). Table 6 summarizes their
responses, including the changes in drafting strategies between routine and post-patch.

For the most popular character selection strategies immediately after patches (Table 6), 44.3% of
respondents choose to pick characters that they feel are the strongest, whereas only 14.0% responses
indicated this to be their routine strategy. Another 9.4% also pointed out that they pick whatever
character is changed regardless of their changes after patches, whereas no participant indicated
that this is part of their routine strategy. For routine character pick strategies, the most popular

one is to prioritize filling roles on the team (47.4%), but the percentage dropped to 36.5% after a
patch release. This shows that characters that are buffed in the patch will gain immediate attention
from players, and see an increase in their pick rates. However, this phenomenon is only temporary,
as indicated in Figures 5 and 6, because eventually players will resume their routine strategies and
prioritize other drafting strategies.

This also explains the anomalies we observed in the cosine similarities and Gini coefficients.
When cosine similarity goes down and Gini coefficient goes up immediately after a new patch, it
shows that players are experimenting and focusing on picking the buffed or changed characters.
Since eventually players will go back to their routine pick strategies, these anomalies remain
temporary. Cosine similarities start to stabilize, which means players eventually stop experimenting
and start focusing on characters and strategies that work for them. Gini coefficients increase when
players attend to characters that are not buffed in the new patch.

Table 7 summarizes survey participants’ agreement with different post-patch strategies (“Think
about the heroes that you play most frequently. How much do you agree with the following
statements?”). The strongest agreement (strongly or somewhat agree) was found around banning
buffed characters (84.2%), drafting buffed characters (85.7%), not banning nerfed characters (66.7%),
and not drafting nerfed characters (64.2%). 56.7% of respondents nevertheless agreed to some extent
that they play characters regardless of buffs or nerfs introduced by a patch. The discrepancy in
self-reported preferences to play buffed characters as well as playing preferred characters likely
captures players’ tendency to revert to a favored character if a newly-buffed character is unavailable
to play because of their own team member’s picks or the other team’s bans.

Relationship between patch severity and behavioral changes
Our second hypothesis predicted more severe patches will have larger changes in drafting behavior.
Table 4 summarizes the aggregate changes in player behaviors (Δ𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒 and 𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑖) against the
changes introduced by the eleven patches in our sample (PSI and Total Changes) using the features
we extracted from each patch time series described in Figure 1. Figure 7 shows the changes in
cosine similarity (top, blue and red) and Gini coefficient (bottom, green and brown) in response to
patches. A best-fit regression line (dotted lines) with 95% confidence intervals (shaded areas) are
estimated for each relationship. The linear regression coefficient (𝛽), significance (𝑝), and explained
variance (𝑟 ) are reported in the lower right corner of each pane. We observe positive coefficients and
moderate r-values for all four behavior changes, though no relationship is statistically significant
at a 𝑝 < 0.05 level because the small number of observations makes the linear regression models
especially sensitive to outliers.

is, the more dissimilar character selection behaviors are compared to before the patch. Patch 6.87
is a major outlier from the trend with major changes to the drafting phase, major changes to
the non-player characters and buildings, and base statistics. The weights we derived from survey
respondents assigned low importance to these types of changes, which could be a reason why the
calculated patch severity does not scale with the observed behavioral change.

positive relationship (𝛽 = 0.09, 𝑝 = 0.360, 𝑟 = 0.31) indicates the more severe a patch is, the more
concentrated character selection behaviors became compared to after the patch.

Patches 6.86, 6.87, and 6.88 had anomalously high changes in Gini coefficients relative to their
calculated patch severity scores. Patch 6.87 continues to be an outlier for all behavior change
measures, for reasons related to those previously discussed above. Patch 6.88 only had changes in
the “Hero” and “Items” categories with the 0 changes in other categories likely over-deflating its
computed severity score. Patch 6.86 saw major reworks to six heroes and their temporary removal
from the “Captain’s Mode” game mode, one of four modes we included in our analysis, that may
have shifted the concentration of character selections following the patch. Patches 6.78 and 6.79
had anomalously low changes in Gini coefficients relative to their calculated patch severity scores.
6.78 had significant changes to the selection phase of Captain’s Mode and 6.79 had many changes
in the Neutral category. These changes may have over-inflated the calculated severity score relative
to the observed behavioral change.

DISCUSSION
Software patches are an overlooked driver of behavioral change on social platforms. Because
patches introduce changes to the rules and incentives within multiplayer online games, players of
these games adapt their tactics and learn new strategies in response. We examined the corpus of
detailed patch notes of the popular MOBA game Dota 2 and compared the number and types of
changes introduced by a patch with the changes in players’ in-game behavior–character selections.
We hypothesized that drafting behavior would change significantly and temporarily following
a patch (H1) and more severe patches would have larger changes in drafting behavior (H2). We
employed a mixture of methods to understand the role of software patches on player behavior,
including a content analysis of 11 major patch notes between 2013 and 2016, log data analysis of
character selection decisions in 532 million matches in the 30 days before and after each of these
patches, and a survey of 437 players to contextualize the patterns from the log data. Our analysis
found evidence of substantial behavioral changes following the release of a new patch and the
magnitude of these behavioral changes are scale with the calculated “severity” of the patch.

Disruptions like software patches are compelling empirical settings to study the relationships
between technology use and social behavior. While software patches are released with the intent to
change user behavior by changing incentives, removing imbalances, and introducing new features,
these changes occur within an extremely complex and multi-dimensional decision space. Changes
to any character, item, or game mechanic can have unintended consequences that are discovered,
exploited, and can ruin the experience for hundreds of thousands of players around the world.
Patches are important para-texts [10, 14] that not only structure the experience of being a player
who attends to patch changes to remain competitive but also being part of a community where patch
changes are occasions to converge, discuss, learn, and collaborate. While our findings primarily
emphasize the behavioral changes occurring within the game, the case study highlights the coupling
of this in-game behavior with content production and engagement in online communities. As social
computing research shifts to ecological perspectives about how users and content move across
multiple social platforms [28, 65, 70, 71], software patches in online games are promising empirical
settings with well-identified disruptions for studying cross-platform behaviors.

Because patches introduce dozens or hundreds of interacting changes simultaneously into this
multi-dimensional space, any of which cause significant changes in behavior, this makes precise
causal identification difficult [30]. This study employed a simple research design focused on the
aggregated behavioral changes following software patches. The combination of multiple sources of
change, the precise documentation of what changed, and the detailed and unobtrusively-gathered

longitudinal observations involving thousands of users makes “patch-induced behavioral change” in
online games like MOBAs extremely rich sites for theory-testing and methodological development.
More complex analyses stratifying players by skill or geography, incorporating other disruptions
like tournaments, or classifying patch changes into more nuanced categories are worthy topics
of future research. Our analyses combining survey and log data only begin to scratch the surface
of this potential but illustrate how players weigh changes to characters more than other patch
changes. These findings are important guides for researchers to orient to the kinds of changes and
behaviors to prioritize given the multiple sources of variation, complexity of behavior, and scale of
data.

The responses of gaming communities to software patches are also unique opportunities to
observe the confluence of cultural norms, social behaviors, and technical practices for maintaining
complex socio-technical infrastructures [36, 48, 52]. Unlike software changes in office productivity
or mobile apps that occur in the background, patches in MOBAs and other online games are
significant disruptions that are eagerly anticipated, hotly debated, and collaboratively indexed [4, 27].
The importance of software patches within gaming communities illuminates the socio-material
relationships of these seemingly banal technical artifacts as not only sites of infrastructural power
and maintenance [8, 11, 60] but also occasions for organizing and even resistance [1, 44, 61]. Our
findings about patch-induced behavioral changes contribute to this emerging strand of research and
invite us to revisit of prevailing conceptions of users of passive consumers of software engineering
practices and instead see them as actively influencing software engineering practices.

Implications
The patch severity index (PSI) can serve as a new tool to analyze the impacts of software patches.
The PSI can be extended methodologically by using alternative data collection and weighting
strategies. While the PSI might be adapted to other online games and social-technical systems to
understand the consequences of changes on player behavior, software patches in other sociotechni-
cal systems do not necessarily induce learning or mimicry among their users. Patches are not a
one-directional relationship: developers react to analytics about player engagement or character
win-rates and players actively lobby for developers to implement changes. These feedback loops
between developers and user communities remain poorly understood and even less theorized. A
well-validated PSI could be used by developers to identify potential sources of community resis-
tance or acceptance to software changes. Efforts to utilize metrics like a PSI could lead to more
“human-centered” and social software engineering strategies that invites greater attention to how
users and communities interpret and adopt the changes introduced by patches.

Multiplayer online battle arenas and esports generally also have enormous cultural and economic
influence [51, 56, 66]. Understanding the contexts and consequences of software patches on game-
play is thus of increasing consequence for elite players, their managers and owners, audiences, as
well as game developers and the general player community. Developing a systematic understanding
of the effects of software patches could improve the ability for professional organizations to identify
new strategies and train more effectively.

Game developers deploy patches to introduce new features, correct errors, and alter incentives
to play the game. Because patches change the fundamental rules and structures of the game, they
destabilize players’ deep investment in developing heuristics, tactics, and strategies about how
to play the game. This coordinated destabilization of meaning has consequences for hundreds of
thousands to millions of people who collectively engage in sensemaking to understand what has
changed, exploration of new possibilities within an enormous and complex decision space, and
learning new strategies and possibilities [63]. Patches thus provide a rich empirical setting to explore
processes of naturalistic decision-making [25], temporary and high-tempo team processes [5, 7, 23],

Characterizing disruptions in online gaming behavior following software patches

and organizational learning [35, 42] unfolding on a cross-cultural scale involving hundreds of
thousands or millions of people.

Limitations and future work
There are some limitations to our analysis. First, we make no claims about the generalizability of
these results to other games or software contexts: the results should only be interpreted in the
context of this large-scale sample of 532 million matches and survey responses for Dota 2 within
this specific time frame. Moreover, this implementation of the PSI may not be generalizable to
other genres of games. However, the PSI as a method can inspire ways to quantify the impact of
software patches by leveraging patch documentation and community feedback on previous patches.
Although measuring post-patch changes using software log data will also show the overall impact
of patches, it is difficult to notice the correlations between the types of changes and the potential
magnitude of impact for each type of changes. By categorizing potential changes and surveying
community reactions towards each category, developers can make more informed decisions about
what to prioritize, how to document changes, and what behavioral changes to monitor.

Second, patches in Dota 2 often introduce many changes in different categories at the same time,
and it is very difficult to causally isolate the relationship between the types of changes and the
magnitude of behavior changes. A newly-introduced character may be overpowered, a popular
character may be nerfed, and underutilized items may be buffed. These changes all interact with
each other in the form of drafts, bans, and in-match tactics that are simultaneously explored and
exploited by players. While we have analyzed over 532 million matches in this analysis, our primary
unit of analysis were the 11 major patches. Including changes in character selection behavior for
patches after 2016 could provide additional statistical power for analyses like the relationship
between patch severity and behavioral changes. Alternative implementations of the Patch Severity
Index, for example emphasizing character changes or determining weights on other criteria, might
recover stronger relationships between patches and changes in player behavior.

Our analysis of player behavior aggregated matches because the data lacked sufficient detail and
coverage to stratify for player skill, history, identity, or geography, all of which can bias estimates
through misaggregation [6]. Prior research has explored the significant differences in team assembly
strategies across skill levels [32] and effects of play session length [54]. Future work should look at
specific game modes, such as Captain’s Mode, where there is a standardized pick-and-ban phase
and players’ team composition strategies have more impact on their drafts. We would expect the
changes in character picks to be more stark, even for patches that did not show significant aggregate
changes. We We particularly emphasize the importance of comparing draft changes across players’
skill brackets as post-patch behavioral changes are likely to vary strongly based on skill and tactics.
Finally, this analysis did not explore the role that online communities and social content play
in behavioral changes. Players use social platforms like discussion forums, news aggregators,
wikis, and streaming sites to produce, revise, and consume information about patches. The case
study suggests software patches not only disrupt in-game player behavior but also social content
production in these communities. Understanding the coupling between the volume and content
of social content production like patch analysis videos could illuminate richer cross-platform
dynamics about patch-induced behavioral change. Furthermore, tournaments, championships, and
streams from elite players are alternative sources of influence where innovative new tactics, builds,
and draft strategies could drive significant changes in aggregate player behavior. Future research
studying player behavior in online games should also consider software patches’ impact for players
in-game and in the online gaming communities.

CONCLUSION
Game developers’ releases of software patches and the behavioral effects of patches on millions
of players is a promising empirical setting for understanding more general processes like the
social consequences of technological disruptions. Unlike most other user communities, software
patches are a prominent and important part of the gaming culture around multiplayer online
battle arena games like Dota 2. Using a mixture of quantitative methods including a survey, text
analysis, and log data analysis, we characterized how players’ character selection behavior changed
following patches, developed a method for quantifying patch severity, and the identified a significant
relationship between patch severity and post-patch behavioral disruption. We encourage future
research to identify the mechanisms linking “patch severity” and behavioral disruptions in other
settings and how players’ responses to patch-induced disruptions can be models for improving the
resilience of social systems.
