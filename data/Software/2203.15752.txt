Abstract

Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) represent a growing
trend in the social media landscape, as opposed to the well-known cen-
tralized peers, which are often in the spotlight due to privacy concerns
and a vision typically focused on monetization through user relationships.
By exploiting open-source software, DOSNs allow users to create their
own servers, or instances, thus favoring the proliferation of platforms that
are independent yet interconnected with each other in a transparent way.
Nonetheless, the resulting cooperation model, commonly known as the
Fediverse, still represents a world to be fully discovered, since existing
studies have mainly focused on a limited number of structural aspects of
interest in DOSNs. In this work, we aim to ﬁll a lack of study on user rela-
tions and roles in DOSNs, by taking two main actions: understanding the
impact of decentralization on how users relate to each other within their
membership instance and/or across diﬀerent instances, and unveiling user
roles that can explain two interrelated axes of social behavioral phenom-
ena, namely information consumption and boundary spanning. To this
purpose, we build our analysis on user networks from Mastodon, since it
represents the most widely used DOSN platform.

We believe that the ﬁndings drawn from our study on Mastodon users’
roles and information ﬂow can pave a way for further development of
fascinating research on DOSNs.

Introduction

The realm of online social networks (OSNs) in the Internet landscape has determined
a radical metamorphosis in our lives. Over the past two decades, we observed the
advent and the rapid growth of numerous OSN platforms. Their extensive diﬀusion

across the globe and in our lives dramatically changed how we share information and
socialize with each other. These platforms introduced new paradigms and imposed
new constraints on the way we communicate within their boundaries.

However, this has eventually exhibited potentially worrying aspects. Since central-
ized OSN platforms — i.e., hosted and controlled by unique owners — have become
pervasive, they started leveraging social media marketing strategies, which exploit
targeted advertisements and content personalization to maximize their purposes. Al-
though these choices would presumably increase user engagement and favor the busi-
nesses of these platforms, latent side eﬀects are around the corner. Just to mention,
there is a risk of running into “information bubbles” or “echo chambers”, with related
distortions of social reality. Furthermore, privacy and security concerns might also
arise when a single actor handles all user data. Hence, the need for alternatives is
evident: social platforms were born to interconnect people, whereas nowadays, they
mainly end up doing marketing by exploiting these connections.

Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) have emerged in response to the
aforementioned demanding issues, so as to bring the user back to the center of the
social stage and to support spontaneous interactions, no longer biased by marketing
mechanisms. Decentralization allows going beyond a single owner, hence giving greater
privacy control to the users. The main components to pursue these objectives are the
availability of open-source software that users can quickly adopt, and the possibility of
connection among diﬀerent servers — commonly referred to as instances — on which
this software runs, which is achieved by leveraging speciﬁc communication protocols.
This seamless connection between instances leads to a federated model, which allows
a user registered to an instance to interact with other users on other instances in a
completely natural and transparent way — i.e., without the need for making further
subscriptions — similarly to email services. The development of countless platforms
based on this federated model has led to the emergence of the so-called federated
universe, commonly known as the Fediverse, a widespread social network made up of
many instances inherently interconnected with each other. These include Mastodon
and Pleroma for microblogging, Pixelfed and Peertube for image and video hosting,
resp., Funkwhale for audio hosting, and others.

Mastodon is by far the most popular platform in the Fediverse and the one that
has attracted the most attention by the research community. Mastodon is a microblog-
ging platform that oﬀers a user experience in line with Twitter, under many aspects,
while including original and valuable functionalities. For instance, Mastodon users
can publish content (dubbed toots) and share other people’s content via the boost
function (similar to the retweet in its centralized counterpart, Twitter). Furthermore,
along with these “traditional” services, the decentralized nature of Mastodon favors
the formation of interest-based communities (i.e., individual instances) analogously
to what happens in other OSNs such as Reddit. This feature results in an enhanced
content management on Mastodon. On the one hand, users can declare some content
as inappropriate for a given instance using the content warning feature, while oﬀering
a textual complement of such content (i.e., a spoiler ); on the other hand, instances’
administrators can explicitly declare the topics of interest that characterize their in-
stances, prohibit some types of contents or even close registrations for their instances.
It should be noted that the latter feature only aﬀects the subscription of new users
at a speciﬁc instance and does not impact on the possibility of interacting with such
instances, thanks to the interoperability ensured by the underlying protocols.

From a technical point of view, Mastodon adopts the ActivityPub protocol,1 which
provides client-to-server and server-to-server communication capabilities. Combined
with subscription mechanisms aimed at retrieving information from remote instances,
this protocol supports the aforementioned seamless communication between users of

diﬀerent Fediverse instances. The outcomes of this extended followship mechanism
on the user experience are manifold. The most noteworthy one is the subdivision of
the user timeline into three possible levels of abstraction: home, local, and federated
timelines. Speciﬁcally, the home timeline contains toots generated by the followed
users, whereas the local and federated timelines contain toots created within the home
instance and public toots from all (local or remote) users known to it, respectively.

Related work Although recently emerged, decentralized social platforms and their
novelties have attracted a certain attention from researchers of various disciplines.
Datta et al. [1] investigated the motivations concerning the decentralization of online
social networking, exploring various raised challenges and opportunities. Guidi et
al. [2] analyzed DOSNs focusing on data management and availability, information
diﬀusion, and privacy; also, they examined limitations and problems associated with
the decentralized paradigm.

As previously mentioned, Mastodon has gained particular consideration from the
research community [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The qualitative interview-based analysis con-
ducted by Zulli et al. [8] sheds light on how Mastodon enables content diversiﬁcation
and community autonomy, supporting horizontal growth between instances rather than
vertical growth within instances. Zignani et al. [5, 7] leveraged network analysis to
explore the interactions between Mastodon users through a set of structural statis-
tics such as degree distribution, triadic closure, and assortativity. They used these
results to compare Mastodon with the platform closest to it from a user experience
perspective, i.e., Twitter [5]. According to the in-degree and out-degree distributions
analyzed by Zignani et al., Mastodon exhibits a more balanced distribution between
followers and followees (with diﬀerences ranging between -250 and 250) than Twitter,
and a limited presence of bots (around 5%) w.r.t. Twitter (where their fraction of
user base was found to be around 15% [9]). Moreover, when focusing on the network
formed by reciprocated edges only, the authors found that the local clustering coeﬃ-
cient of nodes stands numerically between the one of Twitter and the one of Facebook.
Mastodon also diverges from well-known centralized OSNs in terms of assortativity,
as indicated by the lack of correlation between source and destination out-degree, and
between source out-degree and destination in-degree. In addition, negative correlation
(-0.1) was observed between source and destination in-degrees, which indicates that a
user’s popularity is inversely proportional to the users s/he follows. Zignani et al. also
evaluated the inﬂuence of decentralization on relationships between users [7], revealing
how each instance has its own footprint that impacts on the way users connect with
each other.

In [10], we recently contributed to studying the decentralized paradigm through
Mastodon from a diﬀerent perspective, i.e., the instance level. First, we created an up-
dated and highly representative dataset of the relationships between Mastodon users,
upon which we inferred a network model capturing the relationships between Mastodon
instances. Leveraging this model, we delved into the main structural characteristics of
Mastodon, taking a macroscopic as well as a mesoscopic perspective, also analyzing the
Mastodon instance network backbone. Our earlier study revealed a ﬁngerprint charac-
terizing the network of Mastodon instances, through which we distinguish Mastodon
from the most widely used centralized OSNs. Also, we spotted the development of a
mutual-reinforcement mechanism between instances to reduce the potential sectoriza-
tion bias deriving from the decentralization, which is a feature further strengthened
by an emerging modular structure between the instances. In this regard, we provided
insights into the nature of the communities of Mastodon instances, unveiling the main
factors that inﬂuence their development, e.g., topics, languages, and temporal pro-
cesses. We also shed light on the linkage mechanism between instances which shows a
negative degree correlation, thus revealing how users tend to interact regardless of the
relevance of their “home” instance. Finally, we evaluated the evolution of the platform

3

and its role within the Fediverse during the last few years, assessing the achievement of
its structural stability and the temporal consolidation of the role of the most relevant
instances.

It is worth noticing that, being developed on an up-to-date crawling of Mastodon
corresponding to a much larger network than in previous studies, our earlier work
in [10] has set the current state-of-the-art data for modeling Mastodon; however, de-
spite the in-depth investigation made on this data, all ﬁndings drawn from our earlier
study are at instance level only.

Contributions Our research work hence aims to ﬁll a lack of study on user relations
and roles in DOSNs, and in this respect we want to pursue two main interrelated goals:
• First, since DOSNs embrace a myriad of instances, we are interested in under-
standing whether and to what extent interesting, decentralization-driven user
behaviors arise within the membership instances, across diﬀerent instances, or
even correspond to mixed behaviors. This might favor the comprehension and
the modeling of the information ﬂow within and between multiple instances.
• Second, since the human-centric approach of DOSNs undervalues artiﬁcially
imposed interactions, such as those deriving from boosting or advertisement
mechanisms, we want to assess how users shape their roles in a more spontaneous
social networking context. In this respect, our focus is on user roles that are
essential to explain two interrelated axes of behavioral phenomena in online
social networks, namely information consumption and boundary spanning. The
dualism between information consumption and boundary spanning can indeed
profoundly aﬀect the scope of the information ﬂow within a network and its
ﬂuidity, e.g., whether information ﬂows rapidly and spreads widely or remains
conﬁned to speciﬁc areas of the network.

To the best of our knowledge, no works have been proposed so far to analyze user
roles and behaviors in DOSNs based on the above aspects. Note also that our perspec-
tives on the aforementioned aspects of interest in this work are totally independent
from knowledge about textual or media contents produced and exchanged through
the Fediverse, thus exploiting only the topological information of the user relation
network.

To conduct our research study, we shall focus on the most widely known and
representative Fediverse platform, i.e., Mastodon, which is hence the best suited as
case in point for investigating on the DOSN landscape. Moreover, this also allows
us to capitalize on up-to-date data resources and relating ﬁndings from our earlier
work [10].

Our roadmap to delve into the understanding of the above discussed aspects will
be developed so as to pursue a number of objectives that can be summarized into the
following research questions:

Q1 – The User Network structure: What are the main structural characteristics of

the network of following relations between Mastodon users?

Q2 – Representative instances: Are the users belonging to the most relevant Mastodon

instances representative of the entire user network?

Q3 – Boundaries and bridges: Are Mastodon users involved in inter-instance links

and how do they act as local bridges?

Q4 – Over-consumption: Are there Mastodon users who tend to over-consume, i.e.,
lurk, others’ information? Is this behavior bounded to the membership instances
or it spans across the instance boundaries?

Q5 – Dual role users: Are there users who behave as both lurkers and bridges within

their own instance?

4

Q6 – Alternate role users: Can user behavior vary according to the observation scale?
That is, can a user be a lurker within her/his instance and simultaneously act
as a bridge between instances, or vice versa?

Plan of the paper The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
introduces to the Mastodon data and the network models we used in our analysis.
Section 3 presents our structural analysis of the Mastodon user networks, by ﬁrst
considering the full set of users and their relations, then focusing on a representative
subset of the user network corresponding to a selection of the most relevant instances
in Mastodon. Section 4 provides insights into user roles that are relevant to boundary
spanning and information consumption behaviors for the users in Mastodon. Section 5
summarizes the main lessons learned from our analysis, while Section 6 concludes the
paper and provides pointers for future research.

2 Data Extraction and Network Modeling

In our earlier work [10], we developed a privacy-friendly crawler upon the publicly
available Mastodon REST APIs 2 to build an up-to-date and highly representative
dataset. It is worth emphasizing that, to preserve privacy requirements, we relied on
authenticated requests only, i.e., those towards the instances that allowed accountable
requests through their APIs, and we also avoided using any scraping tools.

To account for the decentralized nature of Mastodon, we leveraged on the in-
stances.social website,3 which politely keeps track of the Mastodon instances panorama.
In particular, this website enabled us to locate some “seed” instances (i.e., the online
ones at the time of crawling) from which we started our exploration of the Mastodon
Fediverse. By getting information on the timelines of about 900 instances, we reached
more than 80 000 users, who represented the starting point of a breadth-ﬁrst-search to
discover new connections and, consequently, more users. In this regard, we point out
that although the toots (delivered over the timelines of the seed instances) were in-
spected to discover the corresponding users, the toot data was never stored, therefore
our study described in this work is totally agnostic of textual contents. Furthermore, the
interactions between users in terms of incoming and outgoing links were anonymized
through proper hashing functions at the time of their acquisition.

After processing the fetched data, we came up with about 1.4M unique users and
18M unique links between them, traversing more than 16 000 instances. The protocol
underlying Mastodon, i.e., ActivityPub, supports seamless communication between all
the Fediverse platforms. This implies that the data obtained by means of the APIs
can in principle also concern interactions between Mastodon instances and instances
pertaining to other services in the Fediverse. Therefore, using the aforementioned in-
stances.social and the fediverse.party platforms,4 we discerned the Mastodon instances
within our dataset, splitting them into online and temporarily oﬄine ones, where the
latter correspond to instances that keep an inactive status for at most two weeks (ac-
cording to the instances documentation provided by instances.social). As a result, we
discovered 6 960 Mastodon instances, among which 1 116 were online.

Upon the extracted data, we built networks whose entities (i.e., nodes) represent
users, and we modeled their relationships either at the level of the whole Mastodon
network or at the level of individual instances. Let us denote with U the set of users
and with I the set of instances available in the extracted Mastodon data. We deﬁne
the Mastodon user network as a directed graph G = (cid:104)V, E(cid:105), where the node set V
contains pairs (u, i), with u ∈ U and i ∈ I, and the edge set E ⊆ V × V corresponds to

the set of following relations, such that any (x, y) ∈ E with x = (u, i) and y = (v, j)
means that user u in instance i follows user v in instance j; note that u may coincide
with v only if i (cid:54)= j.

Given a target instance i ∈ I, we deﬁne the instance-speciﬁc user network of i as
the directed subgraph Gi = (cid:104)Vi, Ei(cid:105) induced from G, such that Vi = {u | (u, i) ∈ V} ⊆
U and Ei is the set of edges (u, v) with u following v in instance i.

Given a set of target instances M ⊂ I, we deﬁne the network of the relations
between users of the instances M, dubbed merged network, as the directed subgraph
GM = (cid:104)VM, EM(cid:105) induced from G, such that VM = {u | (u, i) ∈ V ∧ i ∈ M} ⊆ U and
EM is the set of edges (u, v) with u following v in some instance of M.

3 User Network Structure

In this section we begin with answering our ﬁrst research question (Q1), i.e., under-
standing the main structural traits of the user network in Mastodon (Section 3.1).
Next, we take the opportunity of investigating on the presence of noisy or irrelevant
user relations according to requirements speciﬁed for their membership instances (Sec-
tion 3.2). This eventually leads us to answer our second research question (Q2) by
identifying and analyzing the subset of the user network corresponding to the most
relevant instances in Mastodon (Section 3.3), which will be used as our workbench for
the subsequent user behavioral analysis.

3.1 The Mastodon user network

As our ﬁrst action towards the understanding of behaviors of Mastodon users, we
gained a comprehensive view of the main features of the Mastodon user network, both
from a macroscopic and mesoscopic perspective.

In the ﬁrst data column of Table 1, we report the main structural characteristics
analyzed. First, it stands out the high numbers of nodes and edges available in our
network, which indeed captures a large fraction of the existing Mastodon user base.5
We also notice a reasonable fraction of source nodes (i.e., users having only outgoing
links), which would include newcomers at the time of the data acquisition, and in
general users that take a peripheral role in the platform; moreover, the fraction of
sink nodes (i.e., users having only incoming links) is quite small, which would indicate
a moderate presence of users who do not appear to be interested in establishing or
reciprocating connections with other Mastodon users.

Another helpful indicator concerning the linkage between users is expressed by the
degree correlation or degree assortativity, i.e., the probability that a link between two
nodes depends on their respective degrees [11, 12]. Given the observed value, which
is slightly negative yet close to zero, it happens that the Mastodon user network is an
uncorrelated network: this turns out to be explained due to a very interesting trait of
Mastodon, since the lack of degree correlation highlights how users relationships within
Mastodon are generally driven by genuine interests, and not biased by recommendation
mechanisms within or across instances.

We further delved into the relationships between users by investigating aspects of
transitivity (i.e., the likelihood that two incident edges are completed by a third one,
thus forming a triangle) and local clustering coeﬃcient (i.e., how strongly connected
are the neighbors of a node); the latter was measured by averaging either over all
nodes (indicated as “full averaging” in Table 1) or only nodes with degree greater
than one. The relatively higher local clustering coeﬃcient w.r.t. the transitivity is

5At the time of writing of this work, we achieve a coverage that ranges between 62% and
78% of the full audience of Mastodon, according to the fediverse.party and instances.social
websites, respectively.

not surprising, given the low density of the network. Moreover, when coupled with
the moderate fraction of reciprocal edges (i.e., closed loops of length 2), this hints at
the presence of strong local connectivity. At the same time, the average path length
is quite low, about 5.

To understand the community structure of the Mastodon user network, we resorted
to the widely used Louvain [13] and Infomap [14] methods, along with the more
recent Leiden method [15]. Louvain exploits a hierarchical greedy approach based on
two phases, modularity optimization and community aggregation, which are repeated
until there are no more changes to be made on the communities and a maximum of
modularity is achieved.
Infomap optimizes the Map equation, which leverages the
information-theoretic duality between ﬁnding community structures in a network and
minimizing the description length of the movements of a random walker in a network.
The Leiden method is designed to improve upon the Louvain method, by providing
guarantees on the connectivity of the discovered communities through an iterative
algorithm that includes local moving and community aggregation stages, with the
addition of an intermediate stage of reﬁnement of the community connectivity. We
used both the undirected and directed implementations of the Louvain6 and Infomap7
algorithms, whereas for the Leiden algorithm, we used the only available undirected

Table 1 reports the number of communities found by each of the above algorithms,
along with their modularity, if optimized by the corresponding method. We distin-
guish between overall and meaningful communities, the latter being regarded as those
having at least ten users (enclosed in round brackets), and we indicate with * in the
table the cases when we discard edge orientation. As shown by the modularity values
above 0.7 for both Louvain and Leiden algorithms, the Mastodon user network ap-
pears to be characterized by a modular structure. The number of communities found
ranges between 359 (by undirected Infomap) and 629 (by undirected Leiden), which
however is signiﬁcantly reduced when focusing on the meaningful communities, from
127 (by undirected Louvain) and 138 (by undirected Leiden) down to 19, resp. 53, by
undirected, resp. directed, Infomap.

3.2 Filtering out noisy instances

In our structural analysis of the Mastodon user network, we also considered to mea-
sure the eﬀects of simpliﬁcation of the network in terms of pruning of user relations
involving potentially noisy or irrelevant instances. To this purpose, here we capitalize
on related ﬁndings from our previous study [10], in which we assessed the relevance
In this regard, we
of the instances according to the number of links they receive.
observed statistical signiﬁcance (based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) of a lognormal
ﬁtting of the in-degree distribution when removing the instances that are pointed by
less than 51 other instances.

Performing this pruning step on our Mastodon user network implies the removal
of approximately 100k nodes and 1M edges; nonetheless, it should be noticed that the
main characteristics of the Mastodon user network structure have remained substan-
tially unchanged.
In fact, as shown in the central column of Table 1, all statistics
are in line with those relating to the original network. Such consistency allows us to
argue that the most relevant instances strongly determine the backbone of the whole
Mastodon user network, also ensuring its robustness w.r.t. the removal of potentially
noisy elements.

3.3 Narrowing the focus: the top-5 instances

We further investigated the impact of instance selection on the main traits of the
Mastodon user network by focusing on the most important instances. Again fol-
lowing the lead of [10], we selected the top-5 instances by relevance, according to
the maximization of a threefold criterion based on number of registered users, num-
ber of involved links, and data access permission policy; this resulted in the follow-
ing selection of instances: mastodon.social, pawoo.net, mastodon.xyz, mstdn.io and

(on the right) of the full, ﬁltered, and top-5 instance merged networks. (Com-
munity size distributions refer to the solutions by undirected Louvain)

octodon.social.9 Table 2 provides a summary of their size information. We then cre-
ated the user network upon these instances according to the merged network model
(deﬁned in Section 2).

On this merged network, we replicated the structural analysis carried out on the
whole and pruned user-networks, in order to unveil whether and to what extent the
user network of the top-5 instances can be considered representative of the entire
Mastodon user network. As shown in the rightmost column of Table 1, the similarity
between the statistics on the top-5 instance merged network and the corresponding
ones of the whole user network is evident, which supports our above hypothesis of
representativeness of the Mastodon user network. Note that, as concerns the average
path length, we managed to calculate it exactly on the merged network, while for the
much larger full and ﬁltered networks we were forced (due to computational issues)
to an approximation generally valid for random scale-free uncorrelated networks (cf.
Table 1); in this respect, the approximated values of average path length appear to be
very close to the exact value computed on the top-5 instance merged network.

To further strengthen our hypothesis, we also examined the in-degree distributions
and the community size distributions of the three user networks under evaluation.
As shown in Figure 1, for both in-degree and community size, the three networks
have box plots that are very close to each other.
In particular, concerning the in-
degree distributions, the medians are equal to 1 092.5, 1 078.5, and 846, for the full,
ﬁltered, and merged networks, respectively; moreover, the median of the community
size distributions settles on 3 for all the considered networks. This is remarkable,
as not only conﬁrms the relatively low relevance of the instances removed from the
entire user-network, but more interestingly, it indicates that the network of the top-
5 instances can eﬀectively be used as a proxy for the Mastodon user relations; in
addition, by focusing on a small number of large instances, this proxy can in principle
enhance our interpretability of the behavioral patterns to discover in the Mastodon
user relations.

Upon the above ﬁndings and remarks, we chose to narrow our focus on the top-5

instance merged network in the subsequent behavioral analysis of Mastodon users.

9Note that, according to the instances.social website, the top ﬁve ranked instances might
partly be changed, since the time of our crawling of the Mastodon network, w.r.t. one or all

4 Boundaries, bridges, and over-consumption

In this section we delve into the relations between users in top-5 instance merged
network in order to discover user roles that are relevant in terms of two particular
behavioral phenomena, namely boundary spanning and information consumption. We
elaborate on the former in Section 4.1 and on the latter in Section 4.2, which will lead
us to answer our Q3 and Q4 research questions, respectively.

4.1

Instance boundaries and bridges

Here we will focus on those Mastodon users that are involved in inter-instance links
and on how they can be regarded and scored as local bridges in the Mastodon user
network (Q3).

Shell nodes and inter-instance edges
In Table 2, we notice that the sum of
the number of nodes and edges over the top-5 instances are 652 732 and 7 920 818,
respectively, which diﬀers from the size of the merged network.

We inspected our data looking for the reasons of the above fact, and found that
the additional 4 980 nodes and 306 735 edges in the merged network take a speciﬁc
role therein. Given a merged network GM = (cid:104)V, E(cid:105), we deﬁne the aforementioned two
types of entities as follows:

• Shell nodes: a node (v, i) ∈ V is said a shell node if (cid:64)(u, j) ∈ V : i = j ∧

(((u, j), (v, i)) ∈ E ∨ ((v, i), (u, j)) ∈ E).

• Inter-instance edges: ((u, j), (v, i)) ∈ E is said an inter-instance edge if i (cid:54)= j.

Loosely speaking, a shell node is a user linked to users of other instances only, while
an inter-instance edge is a link for users of diﬀerent instances. The Mastodon top-5
instance merged network has indeed 4 980 shell nodes and 306 735 inter-instance edges;
the distribution of such nodes w.r.t. the various top-5 instances is shown in Figure 2,
whereas details about the distributions of the inter-instance edges will be considered
later (cf. Table 5).

Visualization of the inter-instance subnetwork In order to get more in-
sights into the linkage between instances, we visually inspected the inter-instance sub-
network, which models the edges connecting nodes that belong to diﬀerent instances
in the top-5 instance merged network.

Figure 4: Zoom-in views from Fig. 3. Nodes are colored according to their mem-
bership instances, i.e., mastodon.social (blue), pawoo.net (red ), mastodon.xyz
(green), mstdn.io (magenta), and octodon.social (orange). The color of an edge
corresponds to the color of the source instance.

As it can be observed from Figure 3, several interesting patterns emerge. The
ﬁrst eye-catching aspect is the pervasiveness of mastodon.social (colored in blue),
which appears to be dominant in establishing user relationships across instances. The
roots of this phenomenon plausibly lie in the relevance of mastodon.social since it is
commonly recognized as one of the supporting pillars of the Fediverse and the ﬁrst
instance of the Mastodon project. The central area of Figure 3 is characterized by
a particularly intense mix of colors, indicating the presence of user connections that
involve all the instances in the network; this is clearly consistent with the key principle
of the Fediverse as an ecosystem made of independent yet cooperating instances.

Through a detailed inspection of the network in Figure 3, we also spotted some
regions showing further relevant patterns, such as a strong linkage between users of
some pairs of instances or a dense interleaving among multiple instances’ users. In this
regard, as shown in Figure 4 (a), resp. Figure 4 (b), there is a tight connectivity among
users of mastodon.social with users of mstdn.io, resp. users of mastodon.social with
users of mastodon.xyz. An analogous situation can be observed in Figure 4 (c), where
a strong coupling between users of mastodon.social and users of pawoo.net emerges,
with the addition of some sporadic users belonging to mstdn.io, which are nonetheless
well connected with the other two instances.

Moreover, it is worth noticing how the pairwise interactions between (users be-
longing to) diﬀerent instances occur with remarkable intensity even among the largest
instances, as shown in Figure 4 (c). This trait is particularly interesting, since although
such instances can deﬁnitely be regarded as self-suﬃcient and represent stand-alone
social platforms — given their remarkable size — their users tend to interact outside
the boundaries so as to gain a more global user behavioral experience.

Figure 4 (d) illustrates two regions of the network characterized by two diﬀerent
patterns: a particularly marked connection between users of masto- don.social and
users of mstdn.io (on the left), which is also massively involved in a linkage with
users from pawoo.net, and another group of users from diﬀerent instances (as shown
by a mix of colors, on the right). The latter hints at a comprehensive connectivity
between all the instances composing the merged network, as also conﬁrmed by the
identiﬁcation of other regions characterized by users belonging to diﬀerent instances,
i.e., Figures 4 (e) and (f). These events observed in the merged network reveal that
the boundary spanning spotted so far is not limited to pairwise instance links, but it
involves multiple instances. As a consequence, we can argue that Mastodon users fully
exploit the potential of seamless interaction between independent instances provided
by the platform.

It should be noticed that the force-directed layout (ForceAtlas2 ) we used for draw-
ing the network emphasizes the peripheral positioning of portions of the network, such
as those corresponding to the above cases, in which there exists a higher connectivity
among a bunch of nodes of two or few instances than with nodes of the other instances.

Bridges The above discussed boundary entities relate to another aspect of interest
to our analysis of the merged network, which is the presence of nodes connected by
edges acting as local bridges at varying degrees.

An eﬀective method to identify such edges is to measure for each pair of linked
nodes their topological overlap, or normalized embeddedness [16], which is the fraction
of common neighbors a pair of connected vertices has. Indeed, edges acting as bridges
are expected to share few or no neighbors, and in fact the topological overlap enables
smoothing the notion of local bridge, so that the lower the topological overlap of a
linked pair of nodes, the higher the strength of their link as local bridge. Originally
conceived for undirected networks, the topological overlap has also been adapted to
directed networks. Following [17], the directed topological overlap (DT O) for an edge

The application of the node-centric DT O measure produces a ranking of the nodes,
whereby higher ranks (i.e., lower scores) correspond to stronger bridge nodes. (Note
that, for the sake of readability, in the DT O and nDT O deﬁnitions we have omitted
the reference to the membership instances of u and v).

Table 3 shows the percentage of nodes corresponding to selected percentiles of
nDT O score over each of the top-5 instances as well as the whole merged network.
As it can be noted already for the 5-th percentile, it stands out that more than a half
of the node set is identiﬁed as bridges, with peaks above 75% in mastodon.xyz and
mstdn.io.

We also quantiﬁed the existence of nodes showing a strong status as bridges. We
identiﬁed such nodes, dubbed strong-bridges, as the nodes having a nDT O score equal
to zero.
In Table 3, we report the number of strong bridges for each of the top-5
instances: compared to the total number of nodes, the percentage of strong-bridges
appears to be always signiﬁcant, ranging from about 20% (octodon.social) to about
78% (mastodon.xyz).

We also evaluated the impact of source and sink nodes on the overall percentage
of strong bridges found in our analyzed networks. As reported in Table 3, even by
ﬁltering out such nodes, the portion of strong bridges remains evident, unveiling a
relatively low bias due to source and sink nodes at least in the largest networks, where
the percentage of strong bridges ranges from about 13% in pawoo.net to above 27%
in mastodon.social.

4.2 Over-consumption

In this section, we answer our fourth research question (Q4) regarding the identiﬁ-
cation of users that tend to over-consume information produced by others. To this
purpose, we take a particular perspective on this problem, which relies on the theory
of lurking behavior analysis [18, 19].

A key concept in this theory is that (online) social networks are characterized by
a participation inequality principle, whereby the crowd of a social network does not
actively contribute, rather it mostly remains hidden or “silent”, without taking an
active role in the visible participation and interactions with other members. This kind
of users should not be trivially regarded as totally inactive users (i.e., registered users
who do not use their account to join the online community), rather a silent user can
be perceived as someone who gains beneﬁt from information produced by others (e.g.,
reading posts and comments, watching videos, etc.) without mostly giving back to

been shown in several works (e.g., [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]) that lurking is normal and
also an active, participative and valuable form of online behavior, including a form
of cognitive apprenticeship that corresponds to legitimate peripheral participation.
In this respect, lurkers might have a great potential in terms of social capital, since
they acquire knowledge from the community; therefore, when engaged, they become
beneﬁcial for the propaganda and development of the community.

Modeling and analyzing lurking behaviors has been formulated as a eigenvector-
centrality-based node ranking problem, which is totally content-agnostic, as it does not
require other information than the graph topology [17]. The LurkerRank method was
designed to assign each user a score expressing her/his lurking status. In Appendix, we
report the mathematical details of this method. It should be noted that the LurkerRank
method applies to a network graph with reversed edge-orientation, therefore hereinafter
we shall consider any edge (u, v) as a link from u to v where v is a follower of u.

To answer the research question Q4, our main goal is to understand whether and
to what extent lurkers of an instance are target nodes of an information ﬂow coming
either from the same instance or from a diﬀerent instance. To this purpose, we compute
the LurkerRank method to each of the top-5 instance networks as well as to the merged
network. In Table 4, we report the percentage of users identiﬁed as lurkers for selected
percentiles of LR values, where LR symbol is used to denote the scoring function of
LurkerRank (cf. Appendix ). Looking at the table, we notice that the merged network
as well as each of the top-5 instances, but octodon.social, show a percentage of lurkers
that is below 5% and 10% for the 95th and the 90th percentile, respectively, while for
octodon.social, the percentage values at 95th and 90th percentiles are comparable and
set around 40%. However, when extending to the 75th percentile, the percentage of
users increases to at least approximately 30% (for mastodon.social and pawoo.net),
with a peak above 70% in mastodon.xyz and mstdn.io. Note also that the increment

on octodon.social appears to be at a signiﬁcantly lower rate than for the other instance
networks.

Information consumption Once the lurkers at varying degrees were identiﬁed
within the merged network, we investigated the links towards lurker nodes of a spe-
ciﬁc instance w.r.t. the overall incoming links, in order to understand how much the
information ﬂow is “consumed” by (i.e., it is directed to) lurkers, and whether this
occurs internally or externally to their membership instance.

We report the results of our analysis in Table 5 under the column “edges to lurk-
ers”, for each pair of the top-5 instances — including self-pairing, i.e., within-instance
links — and for various lurking score percentiles. At a ﬁrst glance, it can be noted a
certain variety in the percentage values, which indicates a remarkable diﬀerentiation
of information consumption by lurkers within and across the various instances.

On the one hand, there is an evidence of information ﬂow directed to lurkers
from inside their membership instance, although this happens at diﬀerent extents; in
particular, at the 95th percentile, the percentage of links directed to lurkers ranges
from 4.5% in mstdn.io and mastodon.xyz to about 21% in octodon.social.

On the other hand, however, there is also a remarkable amount of information
ﬂow directed to lurkers from outside their membership instance. In this respect, the
mastodon.social instance turns out to be the best target for lurkers, given the highest
percentages of links coming from the other instances (and mastodon.social itself) and
directed to lurkers. In particular, we notice a considerable amount of information ﬂow
from pawoo.net to lurkers in mastodon.social, which is about 50% of the connections
from pawoo.net to mastodon.social. Also, mastodon.xyz and mstdn.io lurkers tend
to absorb most information from outside, while pawoo.net is particularly relevant as

sumers. Self-loops and ﬂow values (cf. Table 5) are omitted to avoid cluttering.
Each ﬂow has the same color as the source instance.

information producer for its own users as well as for users of the other instances.

Overall, the above remarks highlight an important trait of the Mastodon network
as a mix of within-instance and across-instance information consumption of its users.
Figure 5 provides an illustration of the information ﬂow between the top-5 instances,
which complements our understanding from the results shown in Table 5 by high-
lighting a sort of mutual reinforcement among such instances, in terms of information
production, resp. consumption, behaviors exhibited by their users.

Information spreading Analogously to the previous analysis, we examined how
the outgoing links from an instance might be originated by lurkers.

Clearly, as expected from the deﬁnition of lurking behavior, lurkers do not con-
tribute much to the diﬀusion of the information they consume, which is indicated
by the small percentage values reported in Table 5, under the column “edges from
lurkers”. However, some exceptions stand out.
In particular, already at the 95th
percentile, lurkers of mastodon.xyz, mstdn.io and octodon.social contribute to spread
information towards pawoo.net in a non-negligible way. This trend strengthens at the
90th percentile and, for mastodon.xyz and mstdn.io, is boosted at the 75th percentile
(with peaks above 35% from mstdn.io to pawoo.net). The above is remarkable as
we recall that pawoo.net tends to attract lurkers belonging to other instances (e.g.,
mastodon.social and octodon.social), and conversely, we also spotted that lurkers from
all the other instances (especially from mastodon.xyz, mstdn.io, octodon.social) might
contribute to the diﬀusion of information towards pawoo.net.

4.3 Dual role users

Our ﬁfth question (Q5) concerns unveiling the existence of Mastodon users that take
a twofold role as lurkers and bridges. To this purpose, for each of the top-5 instances
and the merged network, we analyzed the overlap between a set of lurkers and a

set of bridge users, selected from their respective ranking solutions according to the
percentile thresholds used in the previous analysis, such that each set pair refers to
the same percentile proportion (i.e., 95th vs. 5th, 90th vs. 10th, and 75th vs. 25th).
Table 6 reports on the results of our analysis. The octodon.social instance shows
by far the largest percentage of users exhibiting the dual role, which is already above
37% w.r.t. the toughest overlap (i.e., LR@95th ∩ nDT O@5th), then settling around
51% for the smoothest overlap (i.e., LR@75th ∩ nDT O@25th). Note that the latter
point corresponds to an increase rate that is much lower than for the other instances,
where the percentages of dual roles keep far below 10% w.r.t. the two largest over-
laps while increasing up to a minimum of 20% (pawoo.net) and a maximum of 77%
(mstdn.io) w.r.t. the overlap LR@75th ∩ nDT O@25th. Interestingly, this is in ac-
cord with the higher, resp.
lower, smoothness in the role identiﬁcation shown by
octodon.social, resp. the other instances, for varying scoring percentiles, as we already
observed in our previous analysis (cf. Table 5). Moreover, the diﬀerence in percentages
corresponding to the LR@75th ∩ nDT O@25th between the two largest instances (i.e.,
mastodon.social and pawoo.net) and the other three instances also depends on the
size of their respective user-bases: in fact, as the number of users in an instance gets
smaller, the volume of information produced becomes more limited, and hence their
users tend not only to consume it but also to act as information ﬂow facilitators; by
doing this, they can contribute keeping the instance sustainable with fresh contents
and timely interactions.

Considering the merged network, there is evidence of a certain presence of dual role
users — thus indicating that a dual role behavioral phenomenon can also occur in a
cross-instance context — with percentages that are in line with some of the instances,
particularly pawoo.net.

Alternate role users Here we consider our sixth research question (Q6). The
goal is to understand whether by mixing the scales of observation, i.e., either locally
within an instance or globally at the level of the merged network, distinct behaviors of
users may arise. As for the previously analyzed research questions, we focus on lurkers
and bridge users, thus aiming to identify whether users can be regarded as lurkers
inside their membership instance yet as bridges in a cross-instance environment, and
vice versa.

In Table 7, we report the percentage of users of a given instance that are identiﬁed
as users showing a lurking role locally and a bridging role globally (upper subtable). As
it can be noted, while a few cases (below 2%) are already identiﬁed w.r.t. LR@95th(L)
∩ nDT O@5th(G), this alternate behavior becomes more evident w.r.t. larger overlaps,
on all instances though at diﬀerent extents. These results allow us to understand how
the information ﬂow moves within a decentralized context. An intra-instance (or local)
lurker is a user who tends to absorb information, while an inter-instance (or global)
bridge is a user who contributes to connect multiple regions of a network of instances.

It follows that the users having this dual scale-dependent role are those who, while
consuming locally produced information, enable the information coming from their
instances to ﬂow into the Fediverse, thus becoming potential information facilitators.
Moreover, as already partially unveiled in our previous analysis on dual role users, the
higher percentages of alternate role users generally found for instances with a smaller
user base suggest a tendency of users in such instances to act as a touch-point and
interconnect diﬀerent regions that cross the instance boundaries.

In Table 7, we also report the percentage of users of a given instance that are
identiﬁed as users showing a bridging role locally and a lurking role globally (bottom
subtable). We observe that the percentage values are generally much lower than the
previously discussed behavioral case. This should not be surprising since if a user
takes a within-istance bridge role, s/he is already committed to broker information
and hence will likely be less inclined to absorb information from the outside. Nonethe-
less, in this scenario, mastodon.social and pawoo.net represent an exception, showing
non-negligible overlaps of alternate role users under less restrictive percentile thresh-
olds. We tend to ascribe this phenomenon to aspects related to the topology of those
instances; in particular, the sparsity of connections over a large user base would favor
some users to absorb information from other instances while acting as bridges locally.

5 Discussion

Here we summarize the main ﬁndings that raised from our extensive analysis of the
Mastodon user relations.

To answer our ﬁrst research question (Q1), we explored the main structural char-
acteristics of the Mastodon user network. Among the noteworthy facts, we observed a
lack of degree correlation, which should be ascribed to a form of spontaneous connec-
tivity between users that relates to the absence of boosting mechanisms for “artiﬁcial”
interactions, such as those due to the widely used recommendation strategies adopted
by the centralized OSNs. From a mesoscopic perspective, based on Louvain, Leiden,
and Infomap community detection methods, the user networks exhibit a moderately
high modularity (around 0.7) and a high number of communities; this trait, which
indicate the existence of small densely connected groups of users tailored to speciﬁc
shared interests, appears to be consistent with the spontaneous connectivity trend in
Mastodon.

Remarkably, all the speciﬁc traits discovered on the full user-network remained
valid also after our step of graph pruning aimed at removing irrelevant instances. This
was further strengthened when we considered a set of instances able to represent the
entire Mastodon user network, as outlined by our second research question (Q2). To
this purpose, supported by some pertinent results from the study in [10], we focused on
the ﬁve most relevant instances in Mastodon. After evaluating their main structural
features and ﬁnding high consistency with the results obtained on the full user-network,
we concluded that the top-5 instance network can be regarded as representative of the

19

whole Mastodon user network, and indeed we used it in our subsequent tasks of user
behavior analysis.

To answer our third research question (Q3), we investigated the linkage between
Mastodon users accounting for the instance boundaries. We indeed found out a signif-
icant fraction of inter-instance links and of shell nodes (i.e., users having connections
with other instances’ users only), thus unveiling an evident boundary-spanning phe-
nomenon, as also conﬁrmed by our visual inspection in Figs. 3 and 4. We delved into
the boundary-spanning mechanisms in Mastodon through the identiﬁcation of users
acting as bridges at varying degrees. To this purpose, by leveraging the notion of di-
rected topological overlap, we discovered a widespread presence of bridge users, with a
non-negligible fraction of what we called strong-bridges, i.e., users having a topological
overlap equal to zero. Interestingly, this still holds even by removing the source and
sink nodes from the network. Therefore, we can state the existence of structurally
strategic nodes holding connections between across-instance regions of the network,
which positively impacts on the eﬀectiveness of information ﬂow between the users
over all Mastodon.

As for our fourth research question (Q4), we modeled the information over-consumption

phenomenon through the Mastodon user network in terms of lurking behaviors. As
thoroughly discussed in the literature, lurkers are silent users who tend to mostly
consume information from the others’ actions rather than produce information; but
at the same time, by holding a certain social capital and given their pervasiveness in
a social network, such users might signiﬁcantly contribute to boundary spanning and
information ﬂow phenomena. In this regard, we built our analysis upon a theoretically
well-founded content-agnostic eigenvector-centrality ranking method, LurkerRank. Our
goal was twofold: to understand whether and to what extent lurkers of an instance are
target nodes of an information ﬂow coming from other users, and whether this involves
the membership instance or the other instances. In this regard, we found out that lurk-
ers are present, at varying degrees, over all the selected instances under study, with
mastodon.social being the preferred instance for information consumption by lurkers.
In general, information consumption is not conﬁned to the membership instance, but
it extends beyond the boundaries of the instances, so as to further capitalize on the
information exchanged through diﬀerent regions of the Mastodon user network. Fur-
thermore, we unveiled that lurkers are also involved in information spreading processes
between instances, even in a non-negligible way as it happens for users in pawoo.net
that are linked to (i.e., follow) lurkers of the other instances.

Our last research questions regarded the existence of users who show a dual lurker-
bridge role, either simultaneously through the whole user network and the instance-
speciﬁc subnetworks (Q5), or alternately as a function of the observation scale, i.e.,
inter-instance and intra-instance perspective (Q6). We found a relatively small frac-
tion of users acting both as lurkers and bridges within their own instances; since these
users normally over-consume but have also the potential of disseminating information,
they could be regarded as information ﬂow facilitators. This trait is present through
all the merged network, and is particularly evident in the smallest instances, where
the produced information is limited to the size of the audience in those instances, and
hence an ampliﬁcation is needed. Concerning the alternate and scale-dependent be-
havior, we spotted the existence of users acting as local (i.e., on their own instances)
lurkers and global (i.e., between instances) bridges, whereas the contrary does not
hold. Reasonably, the former trait allows users to disseminate information from their
own instances outwards, while the latter is unnecessary as they are already responsible
for the intra-instance information spreading. As a ﬁnal remark, we believe that such
dual/alternate-role users can be regarded as highly strategical ones, as their comple-
mentary structural functionality makes them ideal candidates to determine the speed
and scope by which the information ﬂows within Mastodon, and more generally, in a
decentralized social context.

6 Conclusions

Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) aim to bring the social paradigm back
to its roots made up of spontaneous interactions and genuine interests, in contrast
to the marketing-driven engagement mechanisms typically adopted by the centralized
OSNs. To guarantee a user-centric vision, DOSNs support the creation of independent
and self-hosted servers seamlessly connected among each other. Nevertheless, this
metamorphosis of the online social media environment could change how some of the
fundamental components underlying human relationships appear and evolve via the
Internet.

In this work, we have provided a number of insights into DOSN user relations and
behaviors, using as a case in point Mastodon, the most-known service of the Fediverse.
We analyzed the Mastodon user network to answer six research questions encom-
passing the main structural characteristics of the following user relations, the impact
due to the most representative instances on the user network, across-instance bound-
ary spanning and bridges, over-consumption and information ﬂow, dual and alternate
role users.

Our future work plan includes further investigation on the impact that decentral-
ization has on user behaviors and how the latter adapt to allow information ﬂowing
quickly and across instances. In this regard, we are interested in deﬁning a suitable
multilayer network model for the user relations in order to support the character-
ization and analysis of the duality and mutual reinforcement between information-
production and information-consumption behaviors as a function of the users’ time-
lines and instance-based contexts.

Appendix

Lurker ranking methods, originally proposed in [23, 17], are designed to mine silent
user behaviors in the network, and hence to associate each user with a score indicating
her/his lurking status. Since the basic assumption of lurking behaviors is related to the
amount of information a user receives, the key idea in the deﬁnition of lurker ranking
methods is that the strength of a user’s lurking status can be determined based on
three main principles, namely over-consumption, authoritativeness of the information
received, non-authoritativeness of the information produced.

The ﬁrst principle corresponds to the evidence of a disproportion between information-

consumption over information-production exhibited by a user. The second principle
relates to the importance as information producers of a user’s followees (i.e.,
in-
neighbors), while the third principle related to the low importance as information
producer of a user with respect to her/his followers (i.e., out-neighbors).

These principles are implemented in a ranking model so as to diﬀerently weighing
the contributions of a node’s in-neighborhood and out-neighborhood. For the sake of
brevity here, we will refer to only one of the formulations described in [23, 17], which
is that based on the full in-out-neighbors-driven lurker ranking, hereinafter named as
LurkerRank (LR).

Given a directed social graph G = (cid:104)V, E(cid:105), where any edge (u, v) means that v is is
“consuming” or “receiving” information from u, the LurkerRank LR(v) score of node
v is deﬁned as:

LR(v) = α[Lin(v) (1 + Lout(v))] + (1 − α)p(v)

where Lin(v) is the in-neighbors-driven lurking function:

Lin(v) =

1
|N out
v

|

(cid:88)

u∈N in

v

|N out
u |
|N in
u |

LR(u)

and Lout(v) is the out-neighbors-driven lurking function:

Lout(v) =

(cid:80)

|N in
v |

(cid:88)

u∈N out

v

|N in
u |

u∈N out

v

|N in
u |
|N out
u |

LR(u)

where α is a damping factor ranging within [0,1] (usually set to 0.85), and p(v) is the
value of the personalization vector, which is set to 1/|V | by default. To prevent zero
or inﬁnite ratios, the values of the in/out-neighborhood size of a node are Laplace
add-one smoothed. As a result, the higher the LR score of a node, the higher its
likelihood to be regarded as a lurker in the network under study.

It should be noted that the actual meaning of “received information” modeled by
the links in the LurkerRank input graph can depend on the speciﬁc context of network
analysis; in practice, it refers to either a social graph (i.e., a linked pair (u, v) means
that v is follower of u) or an interaction graph (e.g., v likes or comments u’s posts).
LurkerRank has been extensively evaluated on both scenarios [17, 24]. Nonetheless,
although both social and interaction relations are indicators of information consump-
tion by users, the information on interaction data that can be acquired from a real
social network might be signiﬁcantly sparse, and our context of study does not make
an exception to this. Therefore, in this work LurkerRank is applied to a followship
graph, which corresponds to the Mastodon user networks deﬁned in Section 3 (with
reversed edge-orientation).
