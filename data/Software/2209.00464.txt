Abstract—In this article, two analytical formulas for the calcu-
lation of mutual inductance between a circular ﬁlament and line
segment arbitrarily positioning in the space are derived by using
Mutual Inductance Method (MIM) and Babic’s Method (BM),
respectively. Using the fact that any curve can be interpolated
by a set of line segments, a method for calculation of mutual
inductance between a circular ﬁlament and ﬁlament having an
arbitrary shape in the space is proposed based on the derived
analytical formulas. The derived two formulas and the proposed
method (Segmentation Method) were numerically validated by
using FastHenry software and reference examples from the
literature. In particular, the proposed method was successfully
applied to the calculation of mutual
inductance between the
circular ﬁlament and the following special curves such as circle,
circular arc, elliptic arc, ellipse, spiral, helices and conical helices.
All results of the calculation are in good agreement with the
reference examples.

Index Terms—mutual inductance, analytical formula, circular
ﬁlament, special functions, complete elliptic functions, segment.

I. INTRODUCTION

A NALYTICAL and semi-analytical methods in the cal-

culation of self- and mutual-inductances of conducting
elements of electrical circuits have played an important role
in development of power transfer, wireless communication,
sensing and actuation and have been applied in a broad ﬁelds
of science,
including electrical and electronic engineering,
medicine, physics, nuclear magnetic resonance, mechatronics
and robotics, to designate the most prominent.

Although, a number of efﬁcient numerical methodes imple-
mented in the commercially developed software are available,
analytical and semi-analytical methods allow to obtaining the
result of calculations in the form of a ﬁnal formula with a
ﬁnite number of input parameters, which when applicable
may signiﬁcantly reduce computation effort. Providing the
direct access to a calculational formula for a user in such
methods facilitates mathematical analysis of obtained results
of calculation and opens an opportunity for their further
optimization.

In particular, calculation of mutual inductance between a
circular ﬁlament and systems of ﬁlaments of different shapes

is a prime example of application of such analytical methods.
Albeit, collections of formulas for the calculation of mutual
inductance between ﬁlaments of different geometrical shapes
covering a wide spectrum of practical arrangements have
variously been presented in classical handbooks by Rosa [1],
Grover [2], Dwight [3], Snow [4], Zeitlin [5], Kalantarov [6],
among others. However, these analytical methods have proved
their efﬁciency and have been successfully employed in an
increasing number of applications, including electromagnetic
levitation [7], [8], superconducting levitation [9], calculation
of mutual inductance between thick coils [10]–[15], magnetic
force and torque calculation between circular coils [16]–[20],
calculation of magnetic stiffness [21], [22], wireless power
transfer [23]–[25], electromagnetic actuation [26]–[28], micro-
machined contactless inductive suspensions [29]–[31] and
hybrid contactless suspensions [32]–[35], biomedical applica-
tions [36], [37], topology optimization of coils [38], nuclear
magnetic resonance [39], [40],
indoor positioning systems
[41], navigation sensors [42], wireless power transfer systems
[43], [44], magneto-inductive wireless communications [45]
and others.

Kalantarov and Zeitlin showed that the calculation of mutual
inductance between a circular primary ﬁlament and any other
secondary ﬁlament having an arbitrary shape and any desired
position with respect to the primary ﬁlament can be reduced
to a line integral [6, Sec. 1-12, page 49]. Adapting this result,
Poletkin derived the analytical formulas for calculating the
mutual inductance between two circular ﬁlaments having any
desired position with respect to each other in work [12], as
an alternative to Grover’s and Babic’s expressions reported in
works [2] and [11], respectively.

Moreover, it was mentioned in work [12] that the obtained
formula for the treatment of the singular case, when the
circular ﬁlaments are mutually perpendicular, can be applied
also to the calculation of the mutual inductance between a
circle and line segment after taking a minor modiﬁcation
of the original formula. Using this fact and an alternative
approach developed by Babic [11], two analytical formulas for
calculation of mutual inductance between a circular ﬁlament
and line segment arbitrarily positioning in the space are
derived by means of MIM and BM, respectively.

Since, any curve can be interpolated with a desired accuracy
by a ﬁnite number of line segments, a segmentation method
for calculation of the mutual inductance between the primary
circle and a ﬁlament having an arbitrary shape is proposed
and successfully developed based on the two derived formulas

 
 
 
 
 
 
using Kalantarov-Zeitlin’s approach reported in work [12].

for calculation of the mutual inductance between the circle
and line segment. It is shown that for calculation of mutual
inductance by means of the segmentation method, a set of
points belonging to the arbitrarily shaped ﬁlament as the
input data is only needed. The developed methodology is
successfully applied to the calculation of mutual inductance
between the circular ﬁlament and the following special curves
such as circle, circular arc, elliptic arc, ellipse, spiral, helices
and conical helices. All results of calculation are in a good
agreement with the reference examples and successfully vali-
dated by the FastHenry software [46] .

II. MUTUAL INDUCTANCE BETWEEN CIRCULAR
FILAMENT AND LINE SEGMENT

Let us consider the ﬁlament system consisting of a primary
circular ﬁlament having a radius of Rp and a secondary
ﬁlament represented as a line segment having a length of Ls,
which is arbitrarily positioned in the space with respect to the
primary circle as shown in Fig. 1. A coordinate frame (CF)
denoted as XY Z is assigned to the primary circle in a such
way that the Z axis is coincident with the circle axis and the
XOY plane of the CF lies on circle’s plane, where the origin
O corresponds to the centre of primary circle. In turn, the xyz
CF is assigned to the secondary ﬁlament so that its origin C
is attached to one of its endpoints. The axes of the xyz CF
are parallel to the axes of XY Z, respectively.

The linear position of the secondary ﬁlament with respect
to the primary one is deﬁned by the coordinates of the origin
C (xC, yC, zC). The angular position of the line segment is
deﬁned by the angle η and θ corresponding to the angular
rotation around the z-axis of the plane passing through the
z-axis and line segment, and then the rotation of the segment
around an axis, which is perpendicular to this segment-z plane
and passing through the origin C, respectively, as shown in
Fig. 1.

A. Mutual Inductance Method (MIM)

The mutual inductance between the circular ﬁlament and
the line segment arbitrarily orientated in the space can be
calculated by the following formula, which is derived by

where µ0 is the magnetic permeability of free space, ¯(cid:96) = (cid:96)/Ls

ρ = ρ(x, y, η, θ) =

B. Babic’s Method (BM)

Let us consider again the calculation scheme shown in Fig.
1, but in a difference with MIM the line segment is given by
coordinates of its two endpoints, namely, p0(x0, y0, z0) and
p1(x1, y1, z1).

Then, the coordinates of an arbitrary point S (xs, ys, zs) of
the secondary line segment can be written parametrically as
follows:

xs = q ¯(cid:96) + x0, ys = r¯(cid:96) + y0, zs = s¯(cid:96) + z0, ¯(cid:96) ∈ [0, 1],

(7)

where q = x1 − x0, r = y1 − y0, s = z1 − z0. Hence, the
differential element of the line segment becomes

d(cid:126)ls = {q, r, s}d¯(cid:96), ¯(cid:96) ∈ [0, 1].

(8)

While, parametric coordinates of an arbitrary point P
(xp, yp, zp) of the primary circular ﬁlament can be deﬁned
by the following expressions:

xp = Rp cos φ, yp = Rp sin φ, zp = 0, φ ∈ [0, 2π].

(9)

The differential of the primary circular ﬁlament is given by
d(cid:126)lp = Rp{− sin φ, cos φ, 0}dφ, φ ∈ [0, 2π].

(10)

Accounting for equations (10) and (8), the mutual induc-
tance between circular ﬁlament and the line segment can be
calculated by

Worth noting that according to (2) and (16) the mutual
inductance is equal to zero, when the line segment crosses
the Z axis or is located on a line crossing the Z axis.

III. SEGMENTATION METHOD
The secondary ﬁlament having an arbitrary shape and the
primary circular ﬁlament of a radius Rp are considered as
shown in Fig. 2. The secondary ﬁlament is given, for instance,
by a 3D parametric curve σ = σ((cid:96)), where (cid:96) is the parameter
deﬁned within a ﬁnite interval [ϕ0, ϕ1], and the following
inequality ϕ1 > ϕ0 ≥ 0 is valid.

It is assumed that the curve is sampled by n points, so that

respectively. Substituting (20), (21) and (22) into (2),
the
mutual inductance Mi between the circular ﬁlament and i-th
line segment can be calculated. Hence, performing summation
of all n terms of Mi,
the formula for calculation of the
mutual inductance between the arbitrary shape and the primary
circular ﬁlament can be written as follows

Thus, interpolating the parametric σ-curve by n line seg-
ments, the calculation of the mutual inductance between the
arbitrary shape and the primary circular ﬁlament can be
performed by means of using developed formulas, namely, (2)
and (16), which are applied n times to each interpolating line
segment followed by summation executed by (23) and (24)
for all obtained calculation results. The Matlab ﬁles with the
implemented formulas (2), (16), (23) and (24) are available
from the authors as supplementary materials to this article.

segmentation method based on (23) and (24). It is assumed
that the polygon is inscribed in a circle of a radius Rσ lying
on the xy plane as shown in Fig. 4. The parameter (cid:96) is deﬁned
[0, 2π]. This interval determines
within the ﬁnite interval
the distribution of the polygon vertices on the xy plane. In
particular, n-th vertex within such interval of the parameter (cid:96) is
located on the x axis. The linear misalignment of the polygon
is deﬁned by coordinates of point C corresponding to the
centre of the secondary circle, while the angular misalignment
can be deﬁned by Grover’s angles denoted by θ and η [12].

C. Mutual inductance between two circular ﬁlaments

In this section, the method of segmentation is applied to
the calculation of mutual inductance between two circular
ﬁlaments arbitrarily orientated in the space with respect to each
other. Similar to Sec.IV-B, the secondary circle is lying on the
xy plane. The linear misalignment is deﬁned by coordinates
of point C corresponding to the centre of the secondary
circle, and the angular misalignment is deﬁned by Grover’s
angles denoted by θ and η [12]. The results of the calculation
are compared with results obtained by means of analytical
formulas developed by Babic in work [11] and Poletkin in
[12].

The accuracy of interpolation of a circle by line segments
can be measured by the relative error ε, which can be estimated
as the deference between the radius of the circle and a length
of a line joining a centre of the circle and mid point of a line
segment divided by the radius:

ε = 1 − cos

π
n

.

(27)

Form (27) follows the obvious conclusion that the larger the
number of line segments the smaller the error. The required
number of line segments for the given relative error can be
also evaluated by (27) and presented, for instance, in the
logarithmic scale as shown in Fig. 8. As seen from Fig. 8,

Fig. 9. The relative error of calculation of mutual inductance versus the
relative error of interpolation of a circle by line segments.

to interpolate a circle with the relative error, for instance, less
than 10−3, the number of line segments must be more than
100.

For generating input points, equation (25) can be used with
the only difference that the number of line segments is being
chosen in according to the desired accuracy of interpolation of
a circle, which in turn effects on the accuracy of calculation
of mutual inductance.

Indeed, the accuracy of calculation of mutual inductance
can be measured also by the relative error, which is deﬁned
as follows

εσ =

M − Mσ
M

,

(28)

where M is the mutual inductance calculated by Babic’s or
Poletkin’s formula as mentioned above. Clearly that it is de-
pendent on the number of line segments. To exam this point let
us consider the following geometrical arrangement taken from
Babic’s work [11, page 3597, Example 12], as an illustrative
example, in which two circles with radii Rp =16.0 cm and
Rσ =10.0 cm and the centre of the secondary σ-circle is
located at xC = 0, yC =4.3301 cm, zC =17.5 cm and the
angle, θ of 60.0°, but the η angle is chosen to be 45.0° as
shown in Fig. 10. Performing calculation for different numbers

Using the obtained results shown in the above table, the
relative error εσ as a function of the number n of line
segments can be deﬁned, namely, εσ = εσ(n). Moreover,
both functions εσ = εσ(n) and n = n(ε) can be joined
into one function exhibiting the dependency of the relative
error of calculation mutual inductance on the relative error
of interpolation of a circle as shown in Fig. 9. Although,
Fig. 9 shows the evaluation of the error for the particular
arrangement. However, the result is surprisely consistence and
can be used for the preliminary estimation of the error of
calculation in other arrangements as shown below. For further
calculation, the number of line segments is set to 200 that,
according to Fig. 9, the error, εσ, is estimated to be around
0.00015.

Example 12: The primary and secondary circles have radii
of Rp =5 mm and Rs =1 mm, respectively. The centre of
the secondary circle is located at xC = 3 mm, yC =1 mm,
zC =0.5 mm and its angular misalignment are deﬁned by θ =
57.6885° and η = 108.4349° as shown in Fig. 11. The result

secondary circle is located at xC = 10 cm, yC =15 cm,
zC =0.0 cm. The angular misalignment of the secondary ﬁla-
ment is deﬁned as follows θ = 74.4986° and η = 123.6901°.

Then, again let us rotate the η angle in a range 0 <
η ≤ 360o, the calculation of mutual inductance demonstrates
the chaotic distribution of the small error of calculation,
which does not exceeded of 15 × 10−15 nH as shown in Fig.
14. The error is continually distributed without interruption
of its continuity at η =90° and 270° in comparing with
the application of Babic’s and Grover’s formula (please, see
Example 22, in article [12]). Thus, the segmentation method
for the calculation of mutual inductance between two circular
ﬁlaments arbitrarily orientated in the space with respect to
each other does not suffer from the singularity case, when
two circles are mutually perpendicular.

D. Mutual

inductance between circle and a ﬁlament of

Using the proposed methodology based on (23) and (24),
the segmentation method is applied to the calculation of the
mutual inductance between the primary circle and ﬁlaments
arbitrary positioning in the space and having different shapes,
which can be deﬁned, for instance, by parametric equations
of special curves to generate the input set of points (18). In
particular, the following curves such as circular and elliptic
arcs, ellipse, spiral, helices and conical helices are considered
in the proceeding section.

Beginning with the calculation of mutual inductance be-
tween the circle and elliptic arc arbitrary positioning in the
space, the secondary ﬁlament can be deﬁned as a part of ellipse
lying on the xy plane. The ellipse is characterized by its semi-
major axis Aσ directed along the x-axis and semi-minor Bσ
along the y-axis. The parameter (cid:96) is deﬁned within the ﬁnite
interval [ϕ0, ϕ1] as shown in Fig. 15. The linear misalignment
of the arc is deﬁned by coordinates of point C corresponding
to the centre of the ellipse, while the angular misalignment can
be determined by Euler’s angles denoted by α, β and γ. The

of the secondary circle has the following coordinates: xC = 0,

The results show the small error, which has the chaotic na-
ture. Indeed, changing the angle η in a range of 0 < η ≤ 360o
the chaotic distribution of the error is observed as shown in
Fig. 13. Analysis of the ﬁgure depicts that the error does not
exceed of 4 × 10−15 nH. Worth noting that varying the number
of line segments, n, alters the error distribution, but keeps its
value below the observed maximum.

we again consider mutually perpendicular circles having the
same radii as in Example 14, but in this case the centre of
the secondary circle occupies a position on the XOY -surface

For the case of the calculation of mutual inductance between
the circle and a spiral, the secondary ﬁlament is lying on the
xy plane and its geometry can be characterized by the inner
radius Rσ, the number of turns t and the distance between
the turns d as shown on Fig. 18. The boundaries of the ﬁnite
interval of the parameter (cid:96) are estimated as follows

ϕ0 = 2πRσ/d, ϕ1 = ϕ0 + 2πt.

Similar to the elliptic arc,
the linear misalignment of the

the number of turns t is 9. The centre C is located at xC =

V. CONCLUSION

In this article, two novel formulas for calculation of mu-
tual inductance between a circular ﬁlament and line segment
arbitrarily positioning in the space were derived by means of
mutual inductance method and Babic’s method, respectively.
These two formulas were expressed via the integral relation-
ships, whose kernels include the elliptic functions of the ﬁrst
and second kinds. The two formulas are successfully validated
to each other mutually and numerically via the FastHenry
software.

Using the fact

that any curve can be interpolated with
a desired accuracy by a ﬁnite number of line segments, a
segmentation method for calculation of the mutual inductance
between the primary circle and a ﬁlament having an arbitrary
shape is proposed and successfully developed based on the two
derived formulas. It is shown that for calculation of mutual
inductance between the primary circle and the secondary
ﬁlament of an arbitrarily shape by means of segmentation
method based on (23) and (24), the set of points belonging
to the secondary ﬁlament as the input data is only needed.

The proposed segmentation method is successfully applied
to the calculation of the mutual
inductance between the
primary circle and ﬁlaments arbitrary positioning in the space
and having different shapes such as circular and elliptic arcs,
ellipse, spiral, helices and conical helices. All results of cal-
culation are in a good agreement with the reference examples
and successfully validated by the FastHenry software.

Considering a limit case, when the radius of the primary
circle is trending to zero, the developed methodology can be
used for calculation of the magnetic ﬂux density and its gradi-
ent generated by a current-carrying arbitrarily shaped ﬁlament.
As a result, the force and stiffness between two arbitrarily
shaped current-carrying ﬁlaments can be calculated by using

Fig. 20. The conical helices is determined by its radius Rσ, the pitch p,
the number of turns t and the distance between the turns d (the left side

Finally, the calculation of mutual inductance between the
circle and a conical helices is carried out. The geometry of
helices can be deﬁned on the xyz CF by its radius Rσ, the
number of turns t, the pitch p and the distance between turns
d as shown in Fig. 20. The boundaries of the ﬁnite interval of
the parameter (cid:96) are

ϕ0 = 2πRσ/d, ϕ1 = ϕ0 + 2πt.

(36)

The linear misalignment of the conical helices is deﬁned
by coordinates of origin C of the xyz CF, and the angular
misalignment is deﬁned by Euler’s angles as shown in Fig.
20. The following equation generates the input points:

Example 22 (conical helices): The primary circle has radius
of Rp =0.9 m. The conical helices is deﬁned by the following
parameters: the radius Rσ is 0.0 m, the pitch p is 0.1 m, the
number of turns t is 4 and the distance d is 0.04 m. The origin
C is located at xC = 0.3 m, yC =0.2 m, zC =0.5 m. The
angular misalignment is characterized by α = 135°, β = 0.0°
and γ is taken from 0 to 335.0° as shown in Fig. 21. The
number of line segments n is chosen to be 400. The results
