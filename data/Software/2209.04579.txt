ABSTRACT
We demonstrate Tensor Query Processor (TQP): a query processor
that automatically compiles relational operators into tensor
programs. By leveraging tensor runtimes such as PyTorch, TQP is
able to: (1) integrate with ML tools (e.g., Pandas for data ingestion,
Tensorboard for visualization); (2) target different hardware (e.g.,
CPU, GPU) and software (e.g., browser) backends; and (3) end-to-
end accelerate queries containing both relational and ML operators.
TQP is generic enough to support the TPC-H benchmark, and it
provides performance that is comparable to, and often better than,
that of specialized CPU and GPU query processors.

1 INTRODUCTION
The free lunch is over! While from 1985 to 2010 the CPU
performance doubled approximately every 1.5 years, going forward
the expectation is that CPU performance will only double every
20 years [6]. In this post-Moore’s Law era, taking advantage
of hardware acceleration is paramount. Both the database and
the machine learning (ML) communities are well aware of this.
In fact, in the last decade we have been witnessing a growing
investment in techniques able to exploit “commodity” accelerators
such as SIMD instructions and GPGPUs. ML especially is becoming
so predominant that many devices now come with ML-specific
hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple Neural Engine, NVIDIA Tensor
Cores), and the amount of money poured by venture capitalists on
startups focusing on new hardware for ML is soaring [17]. This
trend is mostly driven by the computation requirements of the
state-of-the-art computer vision and NLP models.

However, programming hardware accelerators is notoriously
hard. The ML community has a remarkable tool for easing
the authoring and the deployment of ML models: the tensor
abstraction [9]. Using this abstraction, ML practitioners can enjoy
writing their models in high-level languages, while being free to
run them on any hardware and backend of their choice: let it be

CPUs, GPUs, custom ASICs, edge devices, or even browsers [11]. In
the middle, ML frameworks such as PyTorch [15] are able to map
tensor programs into efficient executions over the target backends.
In this paper, we will refer to any ML framework supporting tensor
programs as Tensor Computation Runtimes (TCRs).

Unfortunately, if we look at the analytical database space, we
see a different picture. In the last several decades, the database
community has been focusing on squeezing every last bit of
performance from hardware devices (e.g., SIMD, GPUs), but, as
a matter of fact, all these efforts are fragmented, specialized, and
unrelated to each other, whereby users cannot enjoy the ease of
deployment as well as the thriving ecosystem which makes Data
Science (DS) and ML so popular.

In [8], we showed how this gap can be filled thanks to Tensor
Query Processor (TQP 1): a SQL query processor built on top of
TCRs. In this demonstration we will showcase TQP features. Users
of TQP can: (1) take advantage of the flexibility and performance
of TCRs, and execute their relational queries over any supported
hardware (e.g., CPU, GPU, TPU) and software (e.g., browser)
backends; (2) end-to-end accelerate queries containing mix of
relational and ML operators such as prediction queries [10]; and (3)
seamlessly integrate with DS workflows and ML tools (e.g., TQP is
pip-installable, and it leverages ML libraries such as Pandas and
Tensorboard for data ingestion and visualization, respectively). TQP
is integrated with Apache Spark [20] and PyTorch: it accepts input
as a Spark SQL physical plan, and it uses a novel compilation stack
based on [12] to lower relational operators into tensor programs
implemented in PyTorch. TQP is expressive enough to support
all the 22 queries composing the TPC-H benchmark, and it often
outperforms specialized CPU and GPU query processors. For
example, on Q6 and Q14 at scale factor 1, TQP is more than 3×
faster than Apache Spark on CPU, and more than 4× faster than
BlazingSQL [4] on GPU. While TQP is still in the prototype phase,
we are actively investigating how it can be leveraged by Microsoft
products, e.g., through ONNX Runtime (ORT) integration [10].

To showcase the versatility and performance of TQP, in this
demo we will guide the audience through three different scenarios:
• In the first scenario, we will show how TQP can be integrated with
DS tools and libraries (Section 3.1). Specifically, we will showcase
our integration with Tensorboard [1], and how this can be used
for visualizing query plans (tensor programs), and profiling query
characteristics as well as operator performance.

• In the second scenario, we will show how TQP can compile and
execute TPC-H queries on different backends (Section 3.2). We will use
an Azure VM equipped with an NVIDIA GPU device, and show the

query performance over CPU, GPU, as well as browser execution
on Web Assembly through ORT.

• In the third scenario, we will show how TQP can both express
and end-to-end accelerate prediction queries containing an ML model
embedded into a SQL query (Section 3.3). Here we will show: (1)
how we extended the Spark SQL syntax with a predict keyword
allowing us to execute, within SQL statements, both traditional ML
(e.g., scikit-learn [16]) models and pre-trained neural networks; and
(2) how relational operators and ML models are compiled into a
unique tensor program that can be end-to-end executed on a GPU.
All the scenarios will be presented as a Python Notebook.
Audience will be allowed to modify the queries and observe the
performance tradeoffs; modify the ML models (Scenario 3), and
interact with the UI (Scenario 1).

2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
In this section, we summarize TQP’s data representation
(Section 2.1), and query compilation and execution (Section 2.2)
previously introduced in [8]. Finally, we report some experimental
number on two TPC-H queries (Section 2.3). We refer readers
to [8] for more details on the system design, implementation, and
algorithms mapping relational operators into tensor programs.

2.1 Data Representation
TQP internally represents tabular data in a columnar format. Each
column of a table is represented as a (𝑛 × 𝑚) tensor, where 𝑛 is
the input number of rows, and 𝑚 is the maximum length needed
to store the column values. Numerical columns are represented as
(𝑛 × 1) tensors, i.e., a single vector column is enough to represent
the numerical values. Date columns are also represented as (𝑛 ×
1) numeric tensors: i.e., the UNIX Epoch in nanoseconds. Finally,
string columns are harder to manipulate efficiently using tensors.
Currently, TQP represents string columns using a (𝑛 × 𝑚) numeric
tensor, where 𝑚 is the maximum character length of any value for
that column. To store a string value in the tensor, TQP right-pads
it with 0s if its length is less than 𝑚. Currently, TQP only supports
UTF-8 encoded string values. TQP automatically transform input
data into the tensor format. Data transformation is in general zero-
copy, except date and strings columns that require data conversion.

2.2 Query Compilation and Execution
The TQP workflow for running a query is composed of two phases:
in the compilation phase, the input query is transformed into an
executable program; in the execution phase, the program is run.
Compilation. TQP’s compilation phase is composed of 4 main
layers: (1) the parsing layer converts the input SQL statements into
an internal Intermediate Representation (IR) plan representing the
input query’s physical plan. The query physical plan is generated
within TQP by an external frontend database system. (2) the
optimization layer implements a rule-based optimizer providing IR-
to-IR transformations; (3) the planning layer translates the IR plan
generated in the previous layer into an operator plan where each
operator in the IR is mapped into a tensor program implementation;
finally (4) the execution layer generates an Executor from the
operator plan. The Executor is the program that will be triggered
at runtime on the selected target backend TCR and hardware.

In its current implementation, TQP uses vanilla PyTorch as the
implementation target of tensor programs in the planning layer.
PyTorch programs are then lowered into different targets in the
execution layer. Currently, PyTorch, TorchScript, ONNX, and TVM
are the supported lower-level targets. On the frontend side, TQP
currently support only Apache Spark, but we are planning to add
support also for other databases. Since TQP translates physical
query plans into an IR, the architecture decouples the physical
plan specification from the other layers, therefore allowing to
plug different frontends. TQP implements novel algorithms for
expressing relational operators into tensor programs.
Execution. TQP first converts tabular data into the tensor format
(as described in Section 2.1), and then the converted data is fed into
the Executor program for generating the query result.

2.3 Performance Evaluation
We report a performance evaluation comparing TQP executing
TPC-H queries 6 and 14 on CPU, GPU and web browser, versus
Apache Spark (on CPU) at scale factor 1. These two queries will
also be used through the demo. Note that the queries, albeit simple,
are not trivial: query 6 contains four filters (over different columns
data types), and aggregation. Query 14 contains a join, as well as
aggregation over a case expression containing a like statement.
For CPU and GPU, we instrument TQP to use the TorchScript
backend. For the web backend, we internally convert the queries in
ONNX and run them on ORT with Web Assembly support [11] in
a JavaScript environment.

We use an Azure NC6 v2 machine equipped with 112 GB of RAM,
an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2690 v4 @ 2.6GHz (6 virtual cores), and an
NVIDIA P100 GPU (with 16 GB of memory). We run both TQP-CPU
and Spark over all cores. We report the median of the execution time
over 5 runs, after 5 warmup runs. The web backend runs on our
personal laptop (a Surface Book 3) to mirror a common client-facing
scenario. As shown in Figure 1, TQP on CPU is around 3× faster
than Apache Spark on both queries, while GPU execution is 20×,
and 6× faster, respectively. As expected, the web execution is quite
slow. Besides the weaker computation power on the personal laptop,
the performance of TQP on the web browser is depending on the
efficiency of ORT, Web Assembly, and the JavaScript environment.
Nevertheless, this last result shows the flexibility of TQP, and its
ability to leverage available open source ML tools.

3 DEMONSTRATION
In this Section we will introduce the three scenarios the TQP demo
consists of. Each scenario uses a Python Notebook run either locally
on a laptop, or on an Azure VM with similar characteristics as the
one described in Section 2.3.

3.1 Scenario 1: Integration with DS Tools
TQP directly integrates with popular DS tools to offer a familiar
developer experience. For instance, TQP is pip-installable, it is
fully implemented in Python, and it only depends on well-known,
enterprise-grade libraries. TQP leverages Apache Spark (pyspark)
to author their queries, and Pandas [13], Numpy [18] and Apache
Arrow [3] for data ingestion. Finally, generating tensor programs for
query execution opens the door to utilizing ML tools for profiling
relational operations. In the first scenario, we will go over: (1) the
integration with Apache Spark for plan generation; (2) integration
with Pandas for data ingestion; and finally (3) integration with
Tensorboard [1] for query profiling.

In this scenario, the audience will be guided through the
following steps: (1) we will show how TQP can be easily pip-
installed and imported within a notebook; then (2) we will import
the lineitem dataset scale factor 1 into the notebook as a Pandas
dataframe; (3) we will show how the selected queries can be
compiled in TQP, and executed over the input dataframe; finally,
(4) we will re-execute the query with the profiler activated and
investigate runtime breakdowns of the query, execution trace, and
memory utilization of the CPU/CUDA kernels in Tensorboard.
Figure 2 highlights one of the runtime charts for TPC-H query
6. Moreover, leveraging TensorBoard’s out-of-the-box capabilities
also helps graphically visualize the generated tensor program of a
query, as depicted in Figure 4 for the query described in Scenario 3.

3.2 Scenario 2: Multiple Backend Support
Extensive efforts have been made by the ML community to
enable TCRs’ compatibility with different software and hardware

GPU devices using TorchScript (torch.jit) and over the
web backend. Switching between different backends and
hardware devices in TQP only needs one line of code change.

backends. For instance, PyTorch has full support for CPU and GPU.
Furthermore, various ML formats like TorchScript and ONNX have
been developed to improve the inference performance through
optimizations, as well as enabling the deployment of models in non-
Python environments such as edge applications or web browsers.
To showcase how relational queries can leverage the above
features, in this scenario we will demo how TQP can compile
and execute the two selected queries on: (1) the CPU using the
TorchScript backend (torch.jit); (2) switching to a GPU device;
and (3) on CPU on a web browser using the web backend. 2 The
workflow for this scenario is as follows: (1) initially we import
all the required libraries; then (2) we import the lineitem dataset
scale factor 1 into the notebook as a Pandas dataframe; and (3) we
show the TPC-H 6 and 14 queries. Then, as presented in Figure 3
for query 6, (4) we will show how TQP compiles the queries into
tensor programs, and how we can easily change the target device
and the backend. Finally, (5) we will run the input data through
the compiled queries (or load the data into the web browser for the
web backend), and show how all of them generate the same correct
result. We also plan to compare the performance of TQP with Spark
over the two TPC-H queries. Figure 1 shows the expected results.
3.3 Scenario 3: Prediction Queries
Many past works have explored how to run ML workloads on
relational engines (e.g., [2, 14]). Doing so enables in-database
ML scenarios with benefits such as improved performance by
minimizing data movement, or reducing engineering effort by
eliminating the need of a dedicated service for model predictions.
This latter feature is already available in commercial database
systems. For example, since 2019, Microsoft SQL Server provides
the ability to run in-database ML predictions through the predict
keyword. This feature allows users to combine, in a single
SQL query, model predictions and standard relational operations.
However, today such in-database ML integrations are typically
done by spawning separate runtimes for relational and ML
computations [14] (e.g., ORT in the SQL Server example). Given
that TQP unifies relational and ML runtimes, embedding ML

2Note that we could also run queries on the web backend targeting the GPU device
through WebGL. However, the current implementation of ORT for WebGL does not
cover all the ONNX operators, and hence execution currently fallback to CPU.

Figure 4: Executor graph for a prediction query (➊). The query (➋) combines an ML model, with a group-by-aggregate statement
embedding a case expression. The query is used to predict the sentiment for each review, and compares the predictions with
the user-provided ratings. The query-graph is interactive and the audience can further double-click on the various components
to visualize how each operator is implemented as tensor operations (➌ shows a zoom-in for the aggregation operator).

into relational queries is even more natural. To showcase
this integration,
in the third scenario we will describe our
implementation of Microsoft SQL Server’s predict keyword in
TQP. Since TQP uses PyTorch as its default TCR backend, TQP
natively supports predictions over any models built using PyTorch.
Furthermore, since TQP integrates and expands Hummingbird [12],
predictions over traditional ML models (e.g., created by libraries
such as scikit-learn [16]) are supported as well. Finally, hybrid ML-
SQL queries too profit from all the features described in the previous
scenarios, e.g., end-to-end acceleration on GPU and integration with
DS tools such as TensorBoard.

In this demo scenario, we will guide the audience through the
creation and execution of predictive queries for two tasks: (1)
Sentiment Classification on the Amazon Product Reviews Dataset
[5]; and (2) Regression on the Iris Dataset [7]. The audience will be
able to try a variety of models ranging from state-of-the-art, pre-
trained transformers models from the HuggingFace Transformers
library [19], to traditional ML models such as those available in
the scikit-learn library. We will also show how to combine these
models with relational operations such as filters or aggregates in a
single SQL query. Figure 4 shows an example of such a query, and
its execution graph visualized in the TensorBoard tool.3
