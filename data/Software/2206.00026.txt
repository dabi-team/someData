Abstract The deluge of network datasets demands a standard way to eﬀectively and succinctly summarize

network datasets. Building on similar eﬀorts to standardize the documentation of models and datasets in

machine learning, here we propose network cards, short summaries of network datasets that can capture not

only the basic statistics of the network but also information about the data construction process, provenance,

ethical considerations, and other metadata. In this paper, we lay out (i) the rationales and objectives for network

cards, (ii) key elements that should be included in network cards, and (iii) example network cards to underscore

their beneﬁts across a variety of research domains. We also provide a schema, templates, and a software

package for generating network cards.

1 Introduction

Network structure can be found in numerous complex systems and it provides a unifying framework to study those

systems collectively [1, 2, 3, 4]. Beyond academic interests, we also live in a connected world and any actions we take

online leave digital traces that echo various socioeconomic networks [5]. Due to its broad appeal and usefulness, the

network perspective is widely used across domains and network data is ubiquitous in science and society.

Despite the universality and deluge of networks, there is currently no consensus nor standard procedures to report

the characteristics of networks and their metadata. As argued in the case of documenting models and data in machine

learning [6, 7], the lack of such standards—and the resulting lack of attention paid to important aspects of models

and datasets—may lead to negative social outcomes. This is equally true for network datasets, particularly given the

ubiquity and relevance of network datasets across academia and industry.

Here we introduce network cards1, standard tabular summaries of network data that capture both metadata about

the network and statistics describing the data themselves. While we cannot expect a “one-size-ﬁts-all” solution given

the variety of networks that scientists consider, network card’s ability to summarize the most basic network statistics

will be broadly appealing and make network data more accessible. Network cards are intended to be ﬂexible enough to

describe a variety of rich network types such as multilayer and higher-order networks and can even extend to describe

multiple networks simultaneously. Network cards are also complementary to other eﬀorts such as more detailed

“datasheets” [7]. Cards can provide a succinct summary of network-speciﬁc information which can be expanded upon

when needed. And, when aspects of a datasheet—which is focused on datasets for machine learning—are not exactly

applicable, the network cards can be used to document both network statistics and key metadata that pertain to data

provenance, ethics, privacy, and other concerns.

A network card can provide researchers with a number of beneﬁts. Glanceable information about a network dataset

allows researchers to quickly digest the most salient features of the dataset. Network cards will answer the most basic

questions about network data, such as: What are the nodes? What deﬁnes links? How big is the network? How dense?

Awareness of the basic information provided by the network cards can prevent misinterpretation of network data and

having a set of standardized statistics and information will encourage both data producers and users to pay attention

to key details such as how and when the data were gathered or whether there are any important ethical considerations

involving the dataset.

2 The need for concise network summaries

Most network researchers are familiar with the Zachary Karate Club [8] (Table 1), a very popular example network. But

did you know that the original data contained eight diﬀerent “interaction contexts” and can be considered a multiplex

network? This rich context is now mostly lost and rarely discussed because the most widely disseminated dataset for

the Karate Club was the version where all contexts are collapsed down to binary edges.

As another example, consider protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. These data are collected through exper-

imental assays that test whether proteins interact with one another. But not all assays are designed to detect dyadic

(pairwise) interactions. For example, whereas Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) does test pair interactions in isolation [9],

Aﬃnity Puriﬁcation Mass Spectrometry (AP-MS) uses tagged bait-prey protein pairs to identify interacting clusters

(complexes) of proteins [10]. In other words, the results of AP-MS assays will over-represent cliques. These diﬀerent

data generating processes have profound consequences for the ﬁnal network structure, with AP-MS-derived networks

Table 1: Example network card for the Zachary Karate Club. A network card is a concise, three-panel, tabular summary of a
network and associated information. The three panels summarize, from top, overall information about the network, the structure
of the network such as its size and density, and meta-information such as where the data originated and any ethical considerations
associated with the data.

exhibiting far more clustering than Y2H. A researcher not recognizing these diﬀerences may draw inappropriate and

biased conclusions, which may lead to potential harms down the line. This leads us to ask, how to best retain critical

information such as these experimental details, external to a network’s structure, when disseminating the network data?

A contributing factor towards losing critical details about experiments and data over time may be information

overload. The scientiﬁc literature is estimated to double in size every 15–25 years [11, 12, 13]. Furthermore,

particularly in the case of network data, we are challenged not only by the growth of the absolute volume of papers,

but also the breadth of the works that deal with network data. Network science is a highly interdisciplinary ﬁeld

and researchers interested in network data come from all domains of research [1] and any eﬀorts to retain critical

experimental and data details should be both succinct—to mitigate information overload—and broadly accessible.

Alongside the literature’s exponential growth, many ﬁelds of research are in the midst of a replication crisis, where

past work has been called into question [14, 15, 16, 17]. Causes of this crisis include poor statistical practice [18, 19, 20]

and poor data documentation [21, 22, 23]. Documenting the provenance of data is crucial for data-driven studies of

networks, and there is a real need for a systematic, standard way to describe the various details of a network dataset,

3

details that are not strictly part of the network topology itself and so are often lost as researchers share data ﬁles

describing that topology but nothing else.

To retain critical details accompanying datasets in the face of information overload while accommodating broad

interdisciplinary interest, we argue that standardization, portability, and succinctness of presentation are critical.

Standardization is crucial not only because it acts as a shared checklist that keep researchers from omitting important

details, but also because it allows the development of shared understanding and tools. The more portable it is, the

easier to prevent the loss of critical metadata. Succinctness of presentation is critical: a researcher should (correctly)

understand the results of a scientiﬁc study as quickly (and accurately) as possible. As the writer of a scientiﬁc study,

this can require hard choices when describing the results, using enough jargon for the intended audience but not more,

enough technical detail for someone to replicate the study but not so much they cannot follow the results, and enough

interpretation so the results are communicated and contextualized clearly but correctly.

Taken together, these factors—information overload, interdisciplinary network interest, and the need to document

data—point towards the need for a succinct, standardized, broadly readable, and portable means to summarize network

datasets. Our goal here is to propose a solution to meet these needs, the network card.

3 Network cards

Network cards were designed to achieve three properties:

1. Concise. A card should be compact and eﬃcient, occupying one page at most. Concise presentation also helps

the portability of the cards.

2. Readable. Any researcher familiar with networks should instantly understand all card contents. Cards should be

as approachable to non-specialists as possible.

3. General and ﬂexible. Works for all types of networks. Can be adapted to special circumstances.

Inspired by summaries of regression models, we propose a three-panel tabular layout for network cards, with the

ﬁrst panel providing overall information about the network, the second panel focusing on structural information related

to the network’s topology, and the third panel describing further meta-information such as availability of metadata,

how the data were generated or gathered, and any ethical concerns to consider.

Table 1 shows a network card for the famous Zachary Karate Club, one of the prototypical example networks used

in the literature. From a glance at the card, a reader can deduce a number of salient details including where the network

data came from, what constitutes nodes and links, the network’s size, and where to go for more information. Although

4

the Karate Club is such a heavily used example, as we discussed above, less familiar may be some of the associated

features of the club, such as when the data were gathered, and the fact that multiple interaction contexts were captured

for the social ties in the network. If this network card can “follow” the data and be readily available, it would be less

likely that such information gets lost.

We now discuss the contents of each panel of a network card in greater detail. Appendix A contains a complete

description, derived from our schema, of all entries broken down by panel.

3.1 Overall information

The top of each network card provides an overall description of the network, a name, whether the network is undirected

or directed, whether there are link weights, and any further considerations worth bringing attention to. Sometimes

left unstated, but absolutely crucial, is explicit deﬁnitions for the nodes and links. Almost always the ﬁrst question a

network scientist asks when a collaborator brings them unfamiliar network data is what constitutes the nodes and what

relationship deﬁnes the links. We believe that providing a prominent and explicit venue for displaying these deﬁnitions

is one of the most valuable aspects of network cards.

3.2 Structure

The second panel of a network card provides basic summary statistics for describing the structure of the network. We

intentionally rely on the most common and broadly understood network statistics, ensuring cards are readable to as

many researchers as possible. Our goal is to summarize the size, density, and connectivity of the network, so we report

the number of nodes and links, the average degree, average clustering coeﬃcient, whether the network is connected,

and the degree assortativity of the network. If the network is connected, we report the network’s diameter. If it is

not connected, we report the number of connected components, the proportion of nodes in the largest component,

a summary of the distribution of nodes per component (component size), and the diameter of the largest connected

component. Table 2, which we discuss in greater detail in Sec.4, demonstrates these statistics.

Examining some network cards, one realizes there is some redundancy in these quantities. For example, the

average degree h𝑘i comes directly from the numbers of nodes 𝑁 and links 𝑀 (via h𝑘i = 2𝑀/𝑁), which we already

report. While it is thus not strictly necessary, we believe it is worth including an entry describing the degree because

(i) we can summarize more of the distribution than its ﬁrst moment (see our notes on statistical summaries, below),

(ii) it saves readers some (albeit simple) mental arithmetic while reading, and (iii) it provides a nice way to compare

networks: often, diﬀerences in average degree are more important than diﬀerent numbers of nodes or links. The

clustering coeﬃcient is another case where its inclusion is useful even if it appears unnecessary: for a bipartite

network, clustering is zero by deﬁnition. However, we feel it is worth always including to maintain consistency and in

this case to reinforce as a “sanity check” this natural feature of a bipartite network. (Imagine the dismay of someone

writing code to process their data and discovering triangles in what should be a bipartite network!)

3.3 Meta-information

Beyond general information about the network and summaries of the network’s topology, we sought to capture additional

salient details that describe the network without directly relating to the network data itself. The presence of metadata

describing the elements of the network is top of mind, and we include entries for noting metadata describing nodes

and describing links. Examples of node metadata include demographic variables for individuals in a social network

or gene ontology terms for proteins in a PPI network. Examples of link metadata include the mode of communication

in a contact network (e.g., text or phone call in a mobile phone network), and the link type (or interaction context) in

6

a multilayer or multiplex network. Often these metadata draw on unique facets of the network under study and can

enable novel research questions by drawing comparisons between features of the network and values in the metadata.

Next, we include information on the date of creation, allowing researchers to specify the time period of the dataset.

In particular, we believe it is important to specify whether the network came from ongoing data collected over a

long period. One situation where this is useful is for comparing networks (see below): we can use the date entry to

distinguish, for instance, a network measured in 2020–21 from that network measured during 2022–23.

An entry describing the data generating process is also included in the meta-information box. Broadly construed,

this entry is intended to brieﬂy describe how the network data were collected, measured, captured, or otherwise

quantiﬁed. A social network derived from mobile phone billing records can thus be distinguished from a social

network derived from chest-worn proximity sensors and from a social network derived from manual observation by

researchers. All are “social networks”, but these very diﬀerent generating processes will have profound impacts on the

form of the network and how the data should be interpreted. Of course, networks are captured by all diﬀerent manners

of data generating processes, making it necessary to be ﬂexible in what details to include, and some processes can

be quite complex and diﬃcult to describe succinctly. Nevertheless, brief descriptions of the process, even relying on

citations for more information, are invaluable and essential.

Lastly, and in many ways most importantly, we provide entries for reporting ethical concerns, funding disclosures,

and a citation. The ethics entry can be used highlight particular concerns such as whether the network data required

informed consent or whether the network data can be freely shared or not. Researchers may also wish to indicate

whether the data are inappropriate for certain applications.

3.4 Important considerations

Some important further considerations are worth noting.

Importance of meta-information While summary statistics of the topology can be extracted programmatically, data

formats are often poor documents of ethical concerns, the meanings of nodes and links, the data generating process, and

so forth, all of which are important for reproducibility and better understanding the data’s nature. Network cards are

therefore a valuable additional document, providing a succinct record of these critical but often ephemeral information

that are not readily captured in the network’s topology.

Statistical summaries Most networks are large and distributions of numeric network properties are typically em-

ployed, perhaps the most popular being the network’s degree distribution, the number of connections per node. To

7

include such information in a network card, we recommend using basic summary statistics, the simplicity of these

statistics being key to our design goals. For most situations, a distribution can be summarized using the mean value

along with a measure of range such as its minimum and maximum. However, many network statistics are heavy-tailed

or broadly distributed and a more robust choice than the mean is the median. Therefore, we propose basic summaries

of the form, “average [min, max]” or “median [5th percentile, 95th percentile]”. One exception is if the quantity

being summarized has only a few values. This can happen, for instance, when summarizing the component sizes of a

network that is not connected but has, say, only two connected components—it does not make much sense to include

summary statistics for only two values. We recommend simply including a list of the observed values when there are

ﬁve or fewer values; our implementation (see below) will do this automatically. We encourage users of network cards

to always include a footnote describing exactly how distributions are summarized such as we use in Table 1.

Absence of graphics Graph layout visualizations are often used to present networks and we considered including

an entry for such a ﬁgure. We decided against it for two reasons. One, layouts are not always helpful or appropriate.

They work best for sparser and smaller networks. Many networks are simply too large or dense to be readable in

a two-dimensional projection, as anyone who has found themselves staring at a “hairball” graphic can attest. Two,

including graphics makes it more challenging to support formats such as plain text or spreadsheets. (This also rules out

other graphical summaries such as histograms.) A purely written format makes such representations easy to produce.

Comparing multiple networks One particular strength of concise tabular summaries is that they are readily extended

to multiple networks simply by adding additional columns. In other words, if a one-network card can be thought of as a

two-column table, with the ﬁrst column labeling each entry and the second for the entry’s contents, then a “multicard”

will have one column for labels and one column for each network. A multicard can be useful in several scenarios, such

as comparing diﬀerent network extraction techniques for the same data, capturing snapshots of a dynamic network, or

even comparing replications of one study across diﬀerent experiments. We show an example multicard in Sec.4.

Special networks Networks are complex, and there is a whole zoology devoted to diﬀerent forms of networks

capturing all manner of diﬀerent structural and dynamic properties. Our standard network card accounts for all

combinations of directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted networks, but many other types of networks exist,

some of which can also be handled well by our standard card but others may require further consideration. We discuss

ways to accommodate such networks.

Bipartite networks, where nodes form two disjoint sets and links exist only between nodes in diﬀerent sets, can be

accommodated with a standard card, but it is worth explicitly denoting the network’s bipartiteness, as we do in Table 2.

8

Some statistics in the structure panel, such as the degree distribution, may be replicated to report the distribution for

both node sets separately.

Temporal networks can be most naturally accommodated by either transforming them into a static network and

noting its temporal nature as metadata (see Table 3), comparing multiple snapshots of the network with a multicard, or

adapting some entries of the card (particularly those in the structure panel) to describe the temporal network directly.

While this last option seems most appealing, it can in fact be the most challenging, as considerable research continues

on how best to quantify temporal networks, and the results of this work have not yet experienced wide adoption

compared to the more basic measures we used. And in terms of describing the results of transforming the dynamic

network into a static network, a network multicard with one column for each choice of transform can actually work

very well to demonstrate and compare those transformations against one another.

Signed networks, where edges have positive and negative values associated with them, can be handled in a standard

network card simply by denoting signedness in the considerations entry. This entry can also include a basic statistic

for the overall proportion of negative links, for example: “links are signed [23.5% links are negative]”. For a signed

network, it is crucial to denote the meaning of signedness in the “Links are” entry, for example: “links are ally (positive

weight) or adversary (negative weight) ties”.

Multilayer networks, where nodes are associated with one or more contexts or layers and links exist between

or across layers, can also be handled by standard cards by denoting their layers as considerations and as node/link

metadata. The structure of the diﬀerent layers can be illustrated, at least when there are not too many layers, by either

expanding each statistic, for example reporting layerwise the sizes, densities, and so forth, or by using a multicard

where each column describes a layer of the network. It may be worth including multilayer-speciﬁc statistics in the

structure panel of the card, but again relying on uncommon measures may not be worth the loss in readability to some

audiences. Important considerations to note are if the network is multiplex, where nodes “replicate” across each layer

and, closely related to multiplex, if the network is multirelation, where multiple links can exist between nodes (cf.

Table 1). Both situations can be well described using the node and link metadata entries as well as the considerations

entry as needed.

Lastly, higher-order networks or hypergraphs have recently seen increased interest. A network card can immediately

indicate whether the network is higher-order using the ‘Links are’ entry, for example: “Links are: social groups

(hyperlinks)”. Among the possible choices for additional statistics to describe the hypergraph’s structure,we recommend

at minimum adding a statistic for the distribution of link size (nodes per link). This basic quantity should be broadly

understood by readers and captures much useful information. Other statistics speciﬁc to higher-order networks may

be worth including as well, again under the caveat that broad readability of the card should be maintained as much as

9

possible.

Implementation To make network cards easy to use, we have created an open source implementation available

online (github.com/network-cards). Our package facilitates generating network cards as tables and spreadsheets, and

to read and write network cards in a standard format (we provide a schema). We also provide templates for the common

network types that researches can complete manually.

4 Examples of network cards

We have assembled some example networks meant to highlight the usefulness of network cards as summaries across

research problems involving network data. These examples span social, biological and ecological research.

Our ﬁrst example, already introduced in Table 1, is the famous Zachary Karate Club. As noted earlier, it displays

both commonly known properties of the network as well as hardly-discussed features (multiple interaction contexts).

Table 2, also previously seen, shows a network card for a bipartite plant–pollinator network [24]. This network,

collected from ﬁeld observations in Spain, highlights the card’s ﬂexibility at concisely capturing metadata. In particular,

it describes the bipartiteness including the numbers of plants and pollinators, the available metadata (species names are

associated with each node), and the study details (when and where the data were collected). We also see the network is

relatively dense, is not globally connected due to a single disjoint link, and the nodes are strongly degree dissortative.

Next, Table 3 shows the network card for a temporal contact network [25]. This network was captured from

proximity sensors worn by participants. We transform the temporal network data to a weighted network and the

network card succinctly documents our processing. As expected for most social networks due to triadic closure, this

network is triangle-heavy, with a clustering coeﬃcient greater than 0.5. Like the previous example, we again see that the

network consists of two disconnected components, where one contains most nodes. This network card also illustrates

how one can describe ethical concerns for the study, including acquiring informed consent from study participants.

Table 4 meanwhile, shows the network card for the recently released HuRI, the human reference interactome [26].

This example shows how biological information can be put into a card, describing the gene metadata associated with

nodes in the network and a brief description of the high-throughput assays used to infer protein-protein interactions

(PPIs). A researcher interested in these data will immediately know where they can turn to enrich their study with node

metadata, in this case using standard GENCODE gene annotations. HuRI also exhibits self-loops, capturing a small

set of self-interacting proteins, and the card naturally draws attention to this information.

Luck et al. contrast HuRI with pre-existing PPI networks, one (“Lit-BM”) extracted binary interactions from

literature curated datasets, another (“HI-union”) combined all previous screening experiments conducted by the

summaries, we can succinctly deﬁne the similarities and diﬀerences in the networks, both in their data generating

processes and in their structure.

5 Discussion

In this paper we propose network cards, simple and accessible tabular summaries of network datasets. Network cards

are intended to be concise, readable, and ﬂexible. Using a corpus of example networks, we highlight the information

contained within network cards and how researchers can employ them in their own work. To help researchers use

network cards, we have created a schema, ﬁll-in templates, and an open source software package for generating cards,

all available at github.com/network-cards.

Broad adoption of network cards may lead to three potential beneﬁts. One, it becomes easier to understand papers

using network data. Readers can more quickly grasp the most salient details of the network or networks employed in the

study—what are the nodes, what are the links, when was the network data collected—when those details are presented

in a standard manner the reader is accustomed to. Quick and accessible information summaries are increasingly

important as the volume of scientiﬁc research grows [27].

A second potential beneﬁt of network cards stems from their highlighting of non-structural information such as

ethical concerns or the presence of metadata, serving as a useful checklist. By drawing attention to these facets of

the data, readers are better equipped to understand the appropriateness and broader consequences of working with

the network data, especially important for data that come with ethical or privacy concerns. Highlighting these details

is important if the data are available and the reader wishes to use it themselves [7]. Those details, which may be

lost when considering only the network structure, may reveal that the data may not be suitable for certain purposes.

The succinctness of network cards can increase the chances for researchers to correctly identify which data to use for

Table 5: A network “multicard”. Here the HuRI network (Table 4) is compared against two other networks from the same study
[26]. A reader can quickly ascertain similarities and diﬀerences between the networks.

themselves.

Lastly, a third beneﬁt of broad use of network cards comes through automation. It is more common for papers to

examine a corpus of hundreds or even thousands of diﬀerent networks [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Analyzing networks at

this scale is invaluable for revealing broad patterns and trends across research domains [34]. But such scale requires

automation: code must be written to analyze each network programmatically. Network cards admit a machine-

readable JSON format, for which we provide a schema. If network cards are created when networks are added to large

corpora, then subsequent analysis programs can read those cards at the same time they read the network data itself. In

other words, standardizing the representation of network meta-information using cards has the potential to make that

meta-information computationally accessible which can then drive a deeper understanding of network corpora.

A Card contents

Here we list all the entries that constitute the standard three-panel network card. These entries are organized by panel

and the descriptions were derived from a schema we have drafted to help with the standardization process.

Overall Describes the network type (directed, weighted, etc.), what do nodes and links represent, what other key

considerations do the data entail.

Name A written identiﬁer for the network

Kind Is the network undirected, unweighted, etc..

Nodes are The deﬁnition of nodes.

Links are The deﬁnition of links (edges).

Link weights are The deﬁnition of link (edge) weights.

Considerations What considerations should be taken into account regarding the network’s overall properties.

Structure Summary statistics for the size, density, and other properties of the network structure.

Number of nodes The number of nodes in the network.

Number of links The number of links (edges) in the network.
