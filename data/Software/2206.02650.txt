Turaev–Viro TQFT and the Rank versus
Genus Conjecture

Qing Lan

June 7, 2022

Abstract

This paper presents a way to estimate the Heegaard genus of a 3-
manifold using the Turaev–Viro state sum TQFT. The Turaev–Viro state
sum TQFT is derived from the modular category associated to the quan-
tum group Uq(sl2), which is unitary for some q by Wenzl. Hence by Tu-
raev and Virelizier the corresponding TQFT is unitary. We modify a proof
by Garoufalidis to give a lower bound of the Heegaard genus using a
unitary TQFT, and then use the software Regina to provide some known
counterexamples to the rank versus genus conjecture.

1 Overview

For a closed orientable 3-manifold M , the Heegaard genus g(M ) of M , is the
minimal genus over all Heegaard splittings of M . The rank r(M ) of M is the
rank of the fundamental group π1(M ). Hence r(M ) ≤ g(M ).

Conjecture 1. r(M)= g(M)?

This conjecture was proposed by Waldhausen [Wal78]. In 1984, Boileau–
Zieschang [BZ84] discovered the ﬁrst counterexamples among Seifert man-
ifolds. Later, for any n, graph manifolds of genus 4n whose fundamental
group is 3n-generated are constructed by Schultens and Weidmann in [SW07].
In 2009, Namazi and Souto [NS09] showed that rank equals genus if the glu-
ing map of a Heegaard splitting is a high power of a generic pseudo-Anosov
map. In 2013, Tao Li showed in [Li13] that there are counterexamples among
hyperbolic manifolds, using topological argument.

In this thesis, we apply the Turaev–Viro TQFT to the rank versus genus
conjecture. We obtain a lower bound of the Heegaard genus of a 3-manifold,
and provide some known counterexamples to the rank versus genus conjec-
ture.

1.1 Background

Inspired by Witten, Reshetikhin and Turaev [RT91] constructed quantum in-
variants using representations of a quantum group Uq(sl2(C)). This invariant
is part of a topological quantum ﬁeld theory (TQFT). This was generalized to
simple Lie algebras of type A, B, C and D in [TW93]. More generally, the TQFT
can be constructed using a general modular category, as is explained in [Tur92]

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
or [Tur10]. There is another approach via Kauffman bracket, see [BHMV92],
[BHMV95]. The book [Lus10] is an introduction to quantum groups.

In [TV92], Turaev and Viro constructed a TQFT using quantum 6j-symbols
associated to Uq(sl2(C)). More generally, the construction can be performed
using a unimodal category, see [Tur10], or using a ﬁnite semisimple spherical
category of non-zero dimension, see [BW96]. This is called the Turaev–Viro–
Barrett–Westbury invariant in the book by Turaev and Virelizier [TV17]. In
2018, Qingtao Chen and Tian Yang [CY18] deﬁned the invariant for a manifold
with boundary and proposed volume conjectures for the Reshetikhin–Turaev
and the Turaev–Viro invariants.

The process of constructing a modular category from Uq(sl2(C)) using the
notion of tilting modules is explained in [BK01]. In [BW96], Barrett and West-
bury used the paper by Andersen and Paradowski [HAP95], and showed that
the quantum sl2 can be used to produce a state sum TQFT. (This general pro-
cedure is needed in the proof of unitarity. )

Wenzl [Wen98] showed that, if g is a simple Lie algebra and q = e

πi
ld where
d = m ∈ {1, 2, 3} is the ratio of the square lengths of a long and a short root
and l = κ is larger than the dual Coxeter number, then the category for Uqg
is unitary. (It is shown in [KJ96] that the category is Hermitian. ) Note that
the ratio is 1 for Lie type A. The dual Coxeter number of An is n + 1, and sl2
corresponds to A1. There is a survey [Row06] on the general case.

It is shown in [TV17], Appendix G, that a unitary fusion category C gives

rise to a unitary state sum TQFT.

1.2 A Lower Bound of the Heegaard Genus

In [Gar98], Theorem 2.2 gives a lower bound of Heegaard genus using a uni-
tary TQFT. This theorem is not correct in general. Note that Theorem 2.2
uses Lemma 2.1, and the author claims that Lemma 2.1 follows from a pa-
per by Witten [Wit89]. In [Wit89], there is an implicit condition on the TQFT,
namely the space associated to S2 must be one-dimensional. This condition is
not mentioned in [Gar98].

We modify this proof in [Gar98] to give the bound.
Parallel to Lemma 2.1 in [Gar98], our unitary TQFT Z must have the fol-

lowing three additional properties:

(1) If M, N are closed 3-manifolds, then Z(M #N )Z(S3) = Z(M )Z(N ).
(2) Z(S2 × S1) = 1.
(3) 0 < Z(S3) < 1.
Assuming the space associated to S2 is one-dimensional, property (1) fol-
lows from a cut-and-paste argument (see Lemma 10.2 in [TV17]). This is true
at least for the state sum TQFT. Lemma 13.6 in [TV17] states that, over any
commutative ring k, the k-module |S2|C is isomorphic to k. (Here C is a spher-
ical fusion k-category. )

As for property (2), section 13.1.3 in [TV17] shows that |S1 × S2|C = 1.
For property (3), |S3|C = (dim(C))−1.
If C is spherical, then dim(C) =
i∈I (dim(i))2, where I is a (ﬁnite) representative set of simple objects of C.
Note that the quantum dimension is not necessarily an integer. Here, we

Combining the results, we obtain a lower bound of the Heegaard genus. It

is worth noting that Corollary 11.7 in [TV13] gives the same bound.

We use the software Regina to search for counterexamples. The conﬁrmed

ones have appeared in [BZ84].

Here is the structure of the thesis. Chapter 2 includes necessary deﬁnitions
and the construction of the category needed, described in [BK01]. In Chapter 3
we construct the state sum TQFT and sketch a proof of unitarity, described in
[TV17] and [TV13]. In Chapter 4 we present the estimation and the computer
search.

2 Modular Category Associated to Uq(sl2)

2.1 Deﬁnitions

Our deﬁnitions are taken from [TV17], [TV13], [Row06], and [BK01].

A monoidal category is a category with a tensor product ⊗ and an identity
object 1 satisfying axioms that guarantee that the tensor product is associative
(up to speciﬁed isomorphism) and that 1 ⊗ X ∼= X ⊗ 1 ∼= X for any object X.
Let C = (C, ⊗, 1) and D = (D, ⊗′, 1′) be monoidal categories. A monoidal
functor from C to D is a functor F : C → D endowed with a morphism F0 :
1′ → F (1) in D and with a natural transformation

F2 = {F2(X, Y ) : F (X) ⊗′ F (Y ) → F (X ⊗ Y )}X,Y ∈Ob(C)

satisfying some compatibility conditions. The monoidal functor is strong if F0
and F2(X, Y ) are isomorphisms for all X, Y .

Let k be a commutative ring. A k-category C is a category such that all
Hom sets are left k-modules and the composition of morphisms is k-bilinear.
An object D of C is a direct sum of objects X1, . . . , Xn if there is a family of
morphisms pi : D → Xi, qi : Xi → D, such that

idD =

qipi, piqj = δij idXi, ∀i, j.

X

An object X of C is simple if EndC(X) is isomorphic to k as a k-module.

A monoidal k-category is a k-category which is monoidal and such that
It is semisimple if any object

monoidal product of morphisms is k-bilinear.
is isomorphic to a direct sum of simple ones.

A monoidal category has (left) duality if for any object X there is an object

X ∗ (the left dual of X) and

bX = coevX : 1 → X ⊗ X ∗, dX = evX : X ∗ ⊗ X → 1

such that

(idX ⊗dX )(bX ⊗ idX ) = idX , (dX ⊗ idX ∗ )(idX ∗ ⊗bX) = idX ∗ .

3

A left rigid category is a monoidal category with a left duality. A rigid category
is a monoidal category which is left rigid and right rigid. Here a right duality
is similarly deﬁned using

evX : X ⊗ X ∗ → 1,

coevX : 1 → X ∗ ⊗ X.

For f ∈ Hom(X, Y ), let

e

g

f ∗ = (dY ⊗ idX ∗ ) (idY ∗ ⊗f ⊗ idX ∗ ) (idY ∗ ⊗bX) .

A braiding in a monoidal category is a collection of natural isomorphisms

cX,Y : X ⊗ Y ∼= Y ⊗ X

such that

cX,Y ⊗Z = (idY ⊗cX,Z) (cX,Y ⊗ idZ ) ,

cX⊗Y,Z = (cX,Z ⊗ idY ) (idX ⊗cY,Z) .

A braiding is symmetric if for all X, Y , cY,XcX,Y = id. In this case the category
is symmetric. A braided functor between braided categories (C, c) and (C′, c′) is
a monoidal functor F : C → C′ such that for all X, Y ∈ Ob(C),

F2(Y, X)c′

F (X),F (Y ) = F (cX,Y ) F2(X, Y ).

A symmetric functor is a braided monoidal functor between symmetric cate-
gories.

A twist in a braided monoidal category is a natural family of isomorphisms

θX : X ∼= X, such that

θX⊗Y = cY,XcX,Y (θX ⊗ θY ) .

A ribbon category is a braided monoidal category with a twist and a left

duality such that θX ∗ = (θX )∗.

A pivotal category C is a rigid category with distinguished duality such that
the induced left and right dual functors coincide as monoidal functors. The
left trace of an endomorphism f of an object X is

trl(f ) = evX (idX ∗ ⊗f )

coevX ∈ EndC(1).

The right trace of f is

g

trr(f ) =

evX (f ⊗ idX ∗) coevX ∈ EndC(1).

The left dimension of an object X is diml(X) = trl(idX ). The right dimension is
dimr(X) = trr(idX ).

e

A spherical category is a pivotal category whose left and right traces coin-

cide. All ribbon categories are spherical.

A pre-fusion k-category is a monoidal k-category C such that there is a set I
of simple objects of C such that 1 ∈ I, HomC(i, j) = 0 for any distinct i, j ∈ I,
and every object of C is a direct sum of a ﬁnite family of elements of I.

A fusion k-category is a rigid pre-fusion k-category which has only a ﬁnite

number of isomorphism classes of simple objects.

4

The dimension of a pivotal fusion k-category C is deﬁned by

dim(C) =

diml(i) dimr(i) ∈ k.

Xi∈I

Let C be a ribbon fusion k-category. For any i, j ∈ I, set

Si,j = tr (cj,ici,j) ∈ EndC(1) = k.

The category C is said to be modular if this S-matrix is invertible over k. The
modularity of C implies that dim(C) is invertible in k.

A Hermitian fusion category is a spherical fusion category C over C endowed

with antilinear homomorphisms

f ∈ HomC(X, Y ) 7→ ¯f ∈ HomC(Y, X)
(cid:9)
(cid:8)

X,Y ∈Ob(C)

such that ¯¯f = f, gf = ¯f ¯g, f ⊗ g = ¯f ⊗ ¯g, evX =

coevX , coevX =

evX .

A unitary fusion category is a Hermitian fusion category C such that tr(f ¯f ) >
0 for any non-zero morphism f in C. The dimension of a unitary fusion
category is a positive real number.

2.2 Representations of Uq(sl2)

We will focus on the case where g = sl2, q = eπi/r, r ≥ 3. We follow [BK01].
Deﬁnition 1. A Hopf algebra A over a ﬁeld k is a bialgebra with an algebra
anti-isomorphism γ : A → A, called the antipode, satisfying µ(id ⊗γ)∆ = ǫ =
µ(γ ⊗ id)∆.

The category of ﬁnite-dimensional representations of A is a rigid monoidal

category.

Let g be a ﬁnite-dimensional simple Lie algebra over C, and h be its Cartan
subalgebra. Let ∆ ⊂ h∗ be the root system, Π = {α1, . . . , αr} ⊂ ∆ be the set of
simple roots, hi = α∨
i ∈ h be the coroots, and A = (aij) be the Cartan matrix,
aij = (α∨
i , αj).

Let P ⊂ h∗ be the weight lattice, Q ⊂ h∗ be the root lattice, and Q∨ ⊂ h be
the dual root lattice (coroot lattice). Let hh·, ·ii be an invariant bilinear form on
g normalized by hhα, αii = 2 for short roots α. Then di := hhαi, αiii/2 ∈ Z+
for all i = 1, . . . , r. Let Cq be the ﬁeld C
q1/|P/Q|
where q is a formal variable.

The module Vn is irreducible for n < κ, and dimq Vn = [n + 1] = 0 if
and only if κ divides n + 1. Hence for 0 ≤ n ≤ κ − 2, Vn is irreducible and
dimq Vn 6= 0. Correspondingly, let C := {0, 1
2 } be the set of weights,
where g = sl2, q = eπi/κ, κ ≥ 3. From now on we index the Weyl modules by
their weights in 1

A module T over Uq(sl2) is called tilting if both T and T ∗ have composition
series with factors Weyl modules. Let T be the full subcategory of C(sl2, κ)
consisting of all tilting modules. If λ ∈ C then the module Vλ is tilting. It
is shown in [HAP95] that the category of tilting modules T is closed under
∗, ⊕, ⊗ and direct summands. It is a ribbon category.

Z.

A tilting module T is called negligible if trq f = 0 for any f ∈ End T . A

morphism f : T1 → T2 is called negligible if trq(f g) = 0 for all g : T2 → T1.

Let Cint
morphisms

:= Cint (sl2, κ) be the category with objects tilting modules and

HomCint (V, W ) = HomT (V, W )/negligible morphisms.

Then Cint is a ribbon category. Any object V in Cint is isomorphic to
Cint
gory with simple objects Vλ(λ ∈ C).

is a semisimple abelian category. Indeed, Cint

is a modular tensor cate-

λ∈C nλVλ.

2.3 Unitarity of the category

For a survey on the general case, see [Row06]. We will focus on the case where
g = sl2, q = eπi/r, r ≥ 3.

The invertibility of S-matrix is shown in [TW93]. Their work is based on
the notion of quasimodular Hopf algebra, which is a weakened version of
modular Hopf algebra introduced in the paper [RT91].

In [KJ96], Hermitian structure on the category is deﬁned in Section 4. Note
that the notation in [KJ96] is different.
In [Wen98], positivity is proved by
Wenzl. Xu [Xu98] independently showed some of the cases covered by Wenzl.
Theorem 2 ([Wen98], [Xu98]). The categories Cint (sl2, κ) are unitary when q =
eπi/κ.

3 Turaev–Viro TQFT

3.1 TQFT

Manifolds considered are assumed to be oriented.

An n-dimensional cobordism is a quadruple (M, Σ0, Σ1, h), where M is a
compact oriented n-manifold, Σ0, Σ1 are closed oriented (n − 1)-manifolds,
and h : (−Σ0) ⊔ Σ1 → ∂M is an orientation preserving homeomorphism.
Two cobordisms (M, Σ0, Σ1, h) and (M ′, Σ0, Σ1, h′) between Σ0 and Σ1 are
homeomorphic if there is an orientation preserving homeomorphism α : M →
M ′ such that h′ = αh.

Let Cob3 be the category with objects closed oriented 2-manifolds and
morphisms cobordisms between them considered up to homeomorphisms. It
is a symmetric monoidal category, where the monoidal product is the ordered
disjoint union of manifolds and cobordisms. Each closed oriented 3-manifold
represents a morphism ∅ → ∅.

Let Modk be the symmetric monoidal category of k-modules.

Deﬁnition 3. A 3-dimensional Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) is a
symmetric strong monoidal functor

Z : Cob3 → Modk .

A conjugation in a monoidal category C is a family of maps
f ∈ HomC(X, Y ) → ¯f ∈ HomC(Y, X)
(cid:9)
(cid:8)

X,Y ∈Ob(C)

compatible with the associativity and unitality constraints of C, such that for
all morphisms f, g in C and all X ∈ Ob(C)

gf = ¯f ¯g,

idX = idX ,

¯¯f = f,

f ⊗ g = ¯f ⊗ ¯g.

7

The category Cob3 has a conjugation

(M, Σ0, Σ1, h : (−Σ0) ⊔ Σ1 → ∂M )

7→ (−M, Σ1, Σ0, hP : (−Σ1) ⊔ Σ0 → −∂M = ∂(−M )) ,

where P is the orientation reversing permutation homeomorphism

(−Σ1) ⊔ Σ0 ≃ (−Σ0) ⊔ Σ1.

Let Hilb be the category of ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces over C and C-
linear homomorphisms between them. This is a symmetric ribbon C-category.
The conjugation is given by assigning to every morphism its hermitian adjoint.

Deﬁnition 4. A unitary 3-dimensional TQFT is a symmetric strong monoidal
functor

Z : Cob3 → Hilb

commuting with the conjugations in Cob3 and in Hilb.

Note that there is a forgetful functor Hilb → ModC. Composing such a
functor Z with the forgetful functor, we obtain a 3-dimensional TQFT. We call
Z a unitary lift of the latter TQFT.

The category Cob3 has a subcategory isomorphic to the category of closed
oriented surfaces and isotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomor-
phisms. Any such homeomorphism f : Σ → Σ′ determines a morphism

(C = Σ′ × [0, 1], Σ, Σ′, h : (−Σ) ⊔ Σ′ ≃ ∂C)

in Cob3, where h(x) = (f (x), 0) for x ∈ Σ and h (x′) = (x′, 1) for x′ ∈ Σ′.
Restricting a TQFT Z : Cob3 → Modk to this subcategory, we obtain the
action of homeomorphisms, and in particular the action of mapping class
groups. We denote the induced map by f# : Z(Σ) → Z(Σ′). It follows that
(f −1)# = (f#)−1.

If, in addition, Z is unitary, then

Proposition 3. hf#x, f#yi = hx, yi.

Proof. The adjoint of f# is the same as the inverse of f#. Indeed there is a
homeomorphism from the conjugation of (C = Σ′ × [0, 1], Σ, Σ′, h : (−Σ) ⊔ Σ′ ≃ ∂C)
to the cobordism associated to f −1.

Theorem 10.3.1 in [Tur10] is a similar result.

3.2 Construction of Turaev–Viro state sum TQFT

We sketch a construction following [TV17] and [TV13].

Fix a spherical fusion k-category C of invertible dimension. Fix a (ﬁnite)

representative set I of simple objects of C.

8

3.2.1 Colored graphs in surfaces

A graph G in an oriented surface Σ is a ﬁnite graph without isolated vertices
embedded in Σ. A graph G is C-colored, if each edge of G is oriented and
endowed with an object of C called the color of the edge.

For a vertex v of a C-colored graph G, the set Ev of half-edges of G incident
to v with cyclic order induced by the opposite orientation of Σ, and the color
c = cv : Ev → Ob(C), the orientation ǫ = ǫv : Ev → {+, −}, together form a
cyclic C-set. The sign is + if e ∈ Ev is oriented towards v.

Starting from e = e1 ∈ Ev, let

He = HomC

(cid:16)

1, c (e1)ǫ(e1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ c (en)ǫ(en)

,

(cid:17)

where X + = X, X − = X ∗.

This module can be made into the symmetrized multiplicity module H(Ev),

independent of the starting point chosen.

Set Hv(G) = H (Ev) and

H(G) = ⊗vHv(G).

Orient the plane R2 counterclockwise. Let G be a C-colored graph in R2.
Pick any αv ∈ Hv(G) and replace v by a box colored with the corresponding
element in the Hom set. This transforms G into a planar diagram which de-
termines, by the graphical calculus, an element FC(G) (⊗vαv) of EndC(1) = k.
See [Tur10], [TV17] or [TV13] for an introduction to the graphical calculus.
This procedure deﬁnes a vector

FC(G) ∈ H(G)⋆ = Homk(H(G), k).

As C is spherical, the invariant FC generalizes to graphs in the 2-sphere.

3.2.2 State sums on skeletons of 3-manifolds

A 2-polyhedron is a compact topological space that can be triangulated using
a ﬁnite number of simplices of dimension ≤ 2 so that all 0-simplices and 1-
simplices are faces of 2-simplices. For a 2-polyhedron P , let Int(P ) be the
subspace consisting of all points having a neighborhood homeomorphic to
R2.

A stratiﬁcation of a 2-polyhedron P is a graph G embedded in P so that
P \ Int(P ) ⊂ G. The vertices and edges of P (1) := G are called respectively the
vertices and edges of P .

Cutting a stratiﬁed 2-polyhedron P along the graph P (1) ⊂ P , we obtain
a compact surface ˜P with interior P \P (1). The (connected) components of ˜P
are called the regions of P . We let Reg(P ) be the (ﬁnite) set of all regions of P .
A branch of a stratiﬁed 2-polyhedron P at a vertex x is a germ at x of an
adjacent region. A branch of P at an edge e is a germ at e of an adjacent region.
The set of branches of P at e is denoted Pe. The number of elements of Pe is
called the valence of e.

The edges of P of valence 1 and their vertices form a graph called the
boundary of P and denoted ∂P . We say that P is orientable (resp. oriented) if all
regions of P are orientable (resp. oriented).

9

A skeleton of a closed 3-manifold M is an oriented stratiﬁed 2-polyhedron

P ⊂ M such that ∂P = ∅ and M \P is a disjoint union of open 3-balls.

Any vertex x of a skeleton P ⊂ M has a closed ball neighborhood Bx ⊂ M
such that Γx = P ∩ ∂Bx is a ﬁnite non-empty graph and P ∩ Bx is the cone
over Γx. The pair (∂Bx, Γx) is the link of x in (M, P ). If M is oriented, then we
endow ∂Bx with orientation induced by that of M restricted to M \ Int (Bx).

Let M be a closed oriented 3-manifold. Fix a skeleton P of M . For a map

c : Reg(P ) → I and an oriented edge e of P , we deﬁne a k-module

Hc(e) = H (Pe) ,

where Pe is the cyclic C-set of branches of P at e. If eop is the same edge with
opposite orientation, then there is a contraction

∗e : Hc(e)⋆ ⊗ Hc (eop)⋆ → k.

The link of a vertex x ∈ P determines a C-colored graph Γx in ∂Bx ≃ S2.
Hence there is a tensor FC (Γx) ∈ Hc (Γx)⋆. Note that Hc (Γx) = ⊗eHc(e),
where e runs over all edges of P incident to x and oriented away from x.
Hence ⊗xFC (Γx) ∈ ⊗eHc(e)⋆, where e runs over all oriented edges of P . Set

3.2.3 The state sum TQFT

Let M be a compact 3-manifold with boundary. Let G be an oriented graph in
∂M such that all vertices of G have valence ≥ 2. A skeleton of the pair (M, G)
is an oriented stratiﬁed 2-polyhedron P ⊂ M satisfying certain requirements
including P ∩ ∂M = ∂P = G.

For any compact oriented 3-manifold M and any I-colored graph G in
∂M , we deﬁne a topological invariant |M, G| ∈ k as follows. Pick a skeleton
P ⊂ M of the pair (M, G). Pick a map c : Reg(P ) → I extending the coloring
of G.

Let E0 be the set of oriented edges of P with both endpoints in Int(M ),
and let E∂ be the set of edges of P with exactly one endpoint in ∂M oriented
towards this endpoint. We have

⊗e∈E∂ Hc(e)⋆ = ⊗vHv (Gop; −∂M )⋆ = H (Gop; −∂M )⋆ ,

where Gop in −Σ is obtained by reversing orientation in all edges of G and in
Σ.

There is a contraction homomorphism

∗P : ⊗e∈E0∪E∂ Hc(e)⋆ → ⊗e∈E∂ Hc(e)⋆ = H (Gop; −∂M )⋆ .

10

The tensor product ⊗xFC (Γx) over all vertices x of P lying in Int(M ) is a

vector in ⊗e∈E0∪E∂ Hc(e)⋆.

Set

|M, G| = (dim(C))−|P |

where |P | is the number of components of M \P , c runs over all maps Reg(P ) →
I extending the coloring of G.
Theorem 5 ([TV13], [TV17]). |M, G| ∈ H (Gop; −∂M )⋆ does not depend on the
choice of P .

Let Σ0, Σ1 be closed oriented surfaces, and let f : Σ0 → Σ1 be a morphism
in Cob3 represented by a pair (M, h). For I-colored graphs G0 ⊂ Σ0 and
G1 ⊂ Σ1,

|M, h (Gop

0 ∪ G1)|C ∈ H (h (Gop

0 ∪ G1) ; ∂M ) ≃ Homk (H (G0) , H (G1)) .

Set

|f, G0, G1| =

(dim(C))|Σ1\G1|
dim (G1)

|M, h (Gop

0 ∪ G1)|C : H (G0) → H (G1) ,

where |Σ1\G1| is the number of components of Σ1\G1 and dim (G1) is the
product over all edges of G1 of the dimensions of their colors.

A skeleton of a closed surface Σ is an oriented graph G embedded in Σ
such that all vertices of G have valence ≥ 2 and all components of Σ\G are
open disks. We let col(G) be the set of all maps from the set of edges of G to
I.

For a closed oriented surface Σ and a skeleton G ⊂ Σ, consider the k-

module

|Σ, G|◦ =

H((G, c); Σ).

Mc∈col(G)

For a morphism f : Σ0 → Σ1 in Cob3 and skeletons G0 ⊂ Σ0 and G1 ⊂ Σ1,
consider the k-linear homomorphism

|f, G0, G1|◦ : |Σ0, G0|◦ → |Σ1, G1|◦

whose restriction to every summand H ((G0, c0) ; Σ0) of |Σ0, G0|◦ is equal to

c1∈col(G1) |f, (G0, c0) , (G1, c1)|.
For any skeletons G, G′ of a closed oriented surface Σ, set

P

p (G, G′) = |idΣ, G, G′|◦ : |Σ, G|◦ → |Σ, G′|◦ ,

|Σ, G| = Im(p(G, G)).

The k-linear homomorphism p (G, G′) restricts to an isomorphism |Σ, G| →

We associate with each morphism f : Σ0 → Σ1 in Cob3 a homomorphism
|f | : |Σ0| → |Σ1|. For each skeleton G of Σ, we have a k-linear cone isomor-
phism τG : |Σ| → |Σ, G|. Pick any skeletons G0 ⊂ Σ0 and G1 ⊂ Σ1. Set

|f | = τ −1

G1 ◦ |f, G0, G1|◦ ◦ τG0 : |Σ0| → |Σ1| .

This homomorphism does not depend on the choice of G0 and G1.

Theorem 6 ([TV13], [TV17]). The functor | · | = | · |C is a 3-dimensional TQFT.

3.3 Unitarity
Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld. Let C be a unitary fusion category (over
C). Then dim(C) 6= 0.

Theorem 7 (Theorem G.1 in [TV17], Corollary 11.6 in [TV13]). The state sum
TQFT | · |C has a unitary lift.

The proof is involved. Recall the construction of the Reshetikhin–Turaev
extended TQFT τB associated to a modular category B over k equipped with
a distinguished square root of dim(B), described in detail in [Tur10]. In this
case unitarity is proved in [Tur10], Chapter IV, section 11.

The center Z(C) of C has a subcategory the unitary center Z u(C) of C, such
that the inclusion is an equivalence of categories. Theorem 17.1 in [TV17]
implies that

| · |C ≃ τZ(C) ≃ τZ u(C).
Since Z u(C) is an anomaly-free unitary modular category, these TQFTs are
unitary.

In this section we introduce the idea of the proof, following [TV13].

3.3.1 Extending to graph TQFTs

The goal of this subsection is Theorem 11.1 and Theorem 11.2 in [TV13]:

Theorem 8 ([TV13]). Let C be a spherical fusion category over an algebraically
closed ﬁeld k such that dim C 6= 0. Then |M |C = τZ(C)(M ) for any closed oriented
3-manifold M . Moreover the TQFTs | · |C and τZ(C) are isomorphic.

Let C be a monoidal category. A half braiding is a pair (A, σ), where A ∈
Ob(C) and σ = {σX : A ⊗ X → X ⊗ A}X∈Ob(C) is a natural isomorphism such
that σX⊗Y = (idX ⊗ σY ) (σX ⊗ idY ) for all X, Y ∈ Ob(C).

The center of C is the braided category Z(C) whose objects are half braid-
ings. A morphism (A, σ) → (A′, σ′) in Z(C) is a morphism f : A → A′ such
that (idX ⊗ f ) σX = σ′
X (f ⊗ idX ) for all X ∈ Ob(C). There is a forgetful
functor.

The following theorem is Theorem 1.2 and Proposition 5.18 in [M ¨u03].
Theorem 9 ([M ¨u03]). Let C be a spherical fusion k-category such that dim C 6=
0. Then Z(C) is an anomaly free modular category with ∆+ = ∆− = dim C,
dim Z(C) = ∆+∆− = (dim C)2.

12

Hence it makes sense to talk about the Reshetikhin–Turaev extended TQFT.
It is necessary to extend the deﬁnition of a TQFT. For any category B, we
deﬁne a category LB of 3-cobordisms with B-colored framed oriented links
inside. The links may be empty so that the category Cob3 is a subcategory of
LB.

By a link TQFT we mean a symmetric monoidal functor Z : LB → Modk.
For a category B, we deﬁne a category GB of 3-cobordisms with B-colored
ribbon graphs inside, see [Tur10]. Here we consider only ribbon graphs dis-
joint from the bases of cobordisms.

By a graph TQFT we mean a symmetric monoidal functor GB → Modk.
The TQFT τZ(C) extends to a graph TQFT still denoted τZ(C), see [Tur10].
This TQFT is non-degenerate, i.e. the vector space τZ(C)(Σ) is generated by the
vectors τZ(C)(M, ∅, Σ)(1), where M runs over all compact oriented 3-manifolds
with Z(C)-colored ribbon graphs inside and with ∂M = Σ.

The TQFT | · |C also can be extended to a graph TQFT. We discuss the

extension to a link TQFT, which is similar.

Let M be a compact oriented 3-manifold, and P be a skeleton. A link in
M can be presented by possibly intersecting circles in P in general position,
called the link diagram. The underlying 4-valent graph may be added to the 1-
skeleton of P . An enriched link diagram in P is a link diagram with half integers
added to record the framing. Two enriched link diagrams in P represent
isotopic framed links if and only if these diagrams may be related by a ﬁnite
sequence of certain moves and ambient isotopies in P .

Consider a pair (M, L), where M is a compact oriented 3-manifold (with
empty graph G = ∅ in the boundary) and L = L1 ⊔ · · · ⊔ LN ⊂ Int(M ) is
an oriented framed link whose all components are non-trivial and colored by
simple objects J1 . . . JN of Z(C). We deﬁne |M, L|C ∈ k as follows. Fix a (ﬁnite)
representative set I of simple objects of C. Pick a special skeleton (see [TV13])
P of M and an oriented enriched link diagram d in P representing L. After
adding d to P (1), we obtain regions.

Pick distinguished square root νJq ∈ k of the twist scalar vJq of Jq. Let

nq ∈ 1

Z be the pre-twist of the loop of d representing Lq. Set

|M, L|C = (dim(C))−|P |

This is a topological invariant of the pair (M, L).

It extends to the case

where links may have trivial components.

It is shown in Theorem 1.2 in [M ¨u03] that here Z(C) is semisimple with
ﬁnitely many simple objects. The invariant extends by linearity to arbitrary
colors of the components of L.

We extend the TQFT | · |C : Cob3 → Modk to a link TQFT LZ(C) → Modk,

and moreover a graph TQFT.

3.3.2 |M, R|C = τZ(C)(M, R)

For a closed (connected) oriented 3-manifold M with Z(C)-colored ribbon
graph R without free ends inside, we claim

Lemma 10. |M, R|C = τZ(C)(M, R).

13

Present M by surgery on S3 along a framed oriented link L. Pick a closed

regular neighborhood U of L, and set E = S3\ Int(U ). We consider R ⊂ E.

Pick a homeomorphism

fL :

S1 × S1

which carries the q-th copy of S1 × {pt} onto a positively oriented meridian of
Lq and carries the q-th copy of {pt} × S1 onto a positively oriented longitude
of Lq determined by the framing.

Deﬁne V = (−(S1 × D2))⊔n, W = (D2 × S1)⊔n. Using fL, the gluing of
W to E yields S3, while the gluing of V to E yields M . The torus vector of a
TQFT Z is the vector w = w(Z) = Z(V ) (1k) ∈ Z(∂V ) = Z
where
n = 1.

Indeed,

Lemma 11. The vectors {[j]}j∈J form a basis.

One can explicitly expand w in terms of this basis. To calculate |M, R|C,

we need Z L

ponents L1, . . . , Ln are colored with j1, . . . , jn, and h·iZ(C) is the graphical
calculus, see Theorem 16.1 in [TV17].

Now Lemma 10 follows from a complete expansion.

14

3.3.3 Proof of Theorem 8

We claim that there is a monoidal isomorphism of the functors τZ(C) and | · |C
from GZ(C) to Modk.

Indeed there is a general criterion establishing isomorphism of two (gen-

eralized) TQFTs, see [Tur10], Chapter III, Section 3. If
(1) at least one of the TQFTs is non-degenerate,
(2) the values of these TQFTs on cobordisms with empty bases are equal,

and

(3) the vector spaces associated with any object have equal dimensions,
then these TQFTs are isomorphic.
The graph TQFT τZ(C) is non-degenerate. That |M, K|C = τZ(C)(M, K)
for any Z(C)-colored ribbon graph K in a closed oriented 3-manifold M is
proven. The equality of dimensions is provided by the following lemma. This
completes the proof of the theorem.

The following lemma is Lemma 11.3 in [TV13].

Lemma 12 ([TV13]). The vector spaces |Σ|C and τZ(C)(Σ) associated with any closed
connected oriented surface Σ have equal dimensions.

Its proof involves more tools like coends and Hopf monads, see [TV13].

3.3.4 Proof of unitarity

A half braiding (A, σ) of C is unitary if σX = σ−1
X for all X ∈ Ob(C). The
unitary center Z u(C) of C is the full subcategory of Z(C) formed by the unitary
half braidings.

The inclusion Z u(C) ⊂ Z(C) is a braided equivalence, see Theorem 6.4 in
[M ¨u03]. Therefore Z u(C) is also modular. The induced conjugation makes
Z u(C) a unitary modular category, and hence the TQFT τZ u(C) is unitary.

Now there are isomorphisms of TQFTs

τZ u(C) ≃ τZ(C) ≃ | · |C.

The ﬁrst one is induced by the braided equivalence Z u(C) ≃ Z(C). The unitary
structure of τZ u(C) is transported to | · |C via the isomorphism.

By Corollary 11.6, Theorem 11.2, and Theorem 11.5 of [Tur10],

Corollary 13 ([TV13]). If C is a unitary fusion category, then

||M |C| ≤ (dim(C))g(M)−1

for any closed oriented 3-manifold M , where g(M ) is the Heegaard genus of M .

In the next chapter we give another proof of a similar theorem.

4 Counterexamples to Rank versus Genus Conjecture

4.1 Estimating the Heegaard genus

In this section we estimate the Heegaard genus, using arguments similar to
Theorem 2.2 in [Gar98]. This theorem is not correct in general. Note that
Theorem 2.2 uses Lemma 2.1, and the author claims that Lemma 2.1 follows

15

from a paper by Witten [Wit89]. In [Wit89], there is an implicit condition on
the TQFT, namely the space associated to S2 must be one-dimensional. This
condition is not mentioned in [Gar98].

However, the estimate is valid in our special case.

Lemma 14 (Lemma 13.6 in [TV17]). Over any commutative ring k, the k-module
|S2|C is isomorphic to k.

The proof is just a direct calculation using deﬁnitions.

Lemma 15 (Lemma 10.2 in [TV17]). Let Z : Cobn → Modk be an n-dimensional
≃ k. Then, for any connected sum M = M0#M1, we
TQFT such that Z
have

Sn−1
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Z (Sn) Z (M, −∂M0, ∂M1) = Z (M1, ∅, ∂M1) ◦ Z (M0, −∂M0, ∅) .

In particular, if ∂M0 = ∂M1 = ∅, then Z (Sn) Z(M ) = Z (M0) Z (M1).

Sketch of proof. For i = 0, 1, pick a ball Bi ⊂ Int (Mi) and set Ni = Mi\ Int (Bi).
Let

b0 : Sn−1 → ∅,

b1 : ∅ → Sn−1, n0 : −∂M0 → Sn−1, n1 : Sn−1 → ∂M1

be the corresponding morphisms.

Pick a k-linear isomorphism z : Z

Z (b1) = λ1z−1 for some λ0, λ1 ∈ k. It follows that

(cid:1)

Sn−1
(cid:0)

→ Z(∅). Then Z (b0) = λ0z and

Z (Sn) idZ(∅) = Z (Sn, ∅, ∅) = Z (b0 ◦ b1) = Z (b0) Z (b1) = λ0λ1idZ(∅).

Hence

Z (Sn) Z (M, −∂M0, ∂M1)
= λ0λ1Z (n1 ◦ n0)
= λ0λ1Z (n1) ◦ Z (n0)
= Z (n1) ◦
= Z (n1 ◦ b1) ◦ Z (b0 ◦ n0)

= Z (M1, ∅, ∂M1) ◦ Z (M0, −∂M0, ∅) .

A direct calculation in section 13.1.3 in [TV17] shows that

Lemma 16 ([TV17]). |S1 × S2|C = 1, and |S3|C = (dim(C))−1.

Here, we consider the original Turaev–Viro TQFT [TV92], at q = eπi/r,

Lemma 17. Let M, N be compact oriented 3-manifolds and f : ∂M → ∂N be an
orientation-preserving homeomorphism. Let Z be a unitary TQFT, and write f# :
Z(∂M ) → Z(∂N ) for the isomorphism induced by f . Then

Z(M ∪f −N ) = hf#Z(M ), Z(N )iZ(∂N ) ∈ C.

16

Proof. In Cob3 there are morphisms

−N : ∂N → ∅, N : ∅ → ∂N.

Hence

Z(−N ) : Z(∂N ) → Z(∅) = C, Z(N ) : C → Z(∂N ).

Note that N and −N are conjugate. By the deﬁnition of unitary TQFT,

hf#Z(M ), Z(N )iZ(∂N )
= hf#Z(M )1, Z(N )1iZ(∂N )
= hZ(−N )f#Z(M )1, 1i
= Z(M ∪f −N ).

In the case where we glue two components Σ1, Σ2 of the boundary of one
manifold M , it is equivalent to glue Σ1 × I to M , and the lemma applies as
well.

angulation, Regina computes the state sum invariant. The function turaevViroApprox()
in Regina computes the given Turaev–Viro state sum invariant of a 3-manifold
using a fast but inexact ﬂoating-point approximation. The function turaevViro()
in Regina computes the given Turaev–Viro state sum invariant of a 3-manifold
using exact arithmetic.

We use the census of all minimal triangulations of all closed prime ori-
entable 3-manifolds that can be built from ≤ 11 tetrahedra, as tabulated using
Regina [Bur11].

A Seifert ﬁbred space is denoted by SFS [B: (p1, q1) (p2, q2) . . . (pk, qk)],

where B is the base orbifold and each (pi, qi) describes an exceptional ﬁbre.

In the special case where there are no exceptional ﬁbres at all, we simply
write the space as B x S1 (if there are no ﬁbre-reversing twists) or B x˜ S1 (if
there are).

The name SFS [B1: . . .] U/m SFS [B2: . . .], m = [ a,b — c,d ] denotes a
graph manifold formed from a pair of Seifert ﬁbred spaces M1, M2. Let φi

4.2.3 Analysis

Here ⋆ means the Heegaard genus is larger than the rank of H1. These are
potential counterexamples.

Proposition 20. (Proposition 1.5 in [BZ84])

G = hs1, . . . , s2q, f | s2

1f, . . . , s2

2q−1f, s2λ+1

2q

f β, s1 . . . s2qf ei

with q ≥ 2, λ > 0 and β arbitrary, admits a presentation with 2q − 2 generators and
2q − 2 deﬁning relators.

Usually the fundamental group considered is a quotient of G. We write

True by [BZ84].

if the manifold is a counterexample by this proposition.

Observe that among the 92 potential counterexamples, 35 of them are
marked as above. By Theorem 3.1 in [BZ84], they are counterexamples. Also,
in the list, any manifold that can be judged by Theorem 3.1 are marked.

Note that the Seifert Euler number in [BZ84] differs from the one deﬁned

in [Mar16] by a sign.

Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 1.1 in [BZ84] also help, and 17 manifolds are

marked with False.

4.2.4 Other remarks

In [Wei03] the writer describes a family of 3-dimensional graph manifolds
consisting of two Seifert ﬁbre spaces whose base orbifolds are the M ¨obius
band and a disk and which have one, repectively two, exceptional ﬁbres. The
considered spaces have 2-generated fundamental group but are not of Hee-
gaard genus 2. It is not difﬁcult to see that these manifolds are of genus 3.
The precise description of those manifolds is given in Theorem 1 there.

Observe that as manifolds, SFS [D: (2,1) (2,-1)]∼= the circle bundle over the
M ¨obius strip with total space orientable. (See Proposition 10.3.33 in [Mar16].
) As Seifert ﬁbrations, SFS [D: (2,k) (2,j)]∼=SFS [D: (2,1) (2,-1)] for k, j odd, and
they need to be considered. (See Proposition 10.3.11 in [Mar16]. ) The TQFT
method only tells us that among the 92 selected manifolds, genus ≥ 3. What
we can detect is the case genus ≥ 3 and rank = 2.

Accordingly, the author thinks that the following manifold might be an-

other counterexample:

7.788854381999799
Z 2 + Z 18

The case r = 4 has been considered by the author and nothing interesting

was found in the database.

There is also a census of smallest known closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds
(where “smallest” refers to volume), as tabulated by Hodgson and Weeks
[HW94]. The cases r = 3, 4, 5, 6 have been considered by the author and
nothing interesting was found in this database.

I would like to thank Professor Nicolai Reshetikhin for guiding me to quan-
tum topology, which is the key tool in this thesis, and is in itself interesting
and useful. Also I would like to thank Professor Yi Liu for introducing me
to the conjecture, and Professor Xiaoming Du for discussions before the use
of TQFT. I thank Professor Yin Tian for telling me there is something called
TQFT.

I thank Professor Qingtao Chen, Tian Yang and Tao Li for related talks, and
Professor Yang Su for inviting me to give a talk at Academy of Mathematics
and Systems Science, CAS. I thank Xiang Liu for his idea after the talk, and
