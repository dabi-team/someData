ABSTRACT 

Based  on  an  ethnographic  action  research  study  for  a  Digital  Twin  (DT)  deployment  on  an 
automated  highway  maintenance  project,  this  paper  reports  some  of  the  stumbling  blocks  that 
practitioners face while deploying a DT in practice. At the outset, the scope of the case study was 
broadly defined in terms of digitalization, and software development and deployment, which later 
pivoted towards the concept of Digital Twin during the collective reflection sessions between the 
project participants. Through an iterative learning cycle via discussions among the various project 
stakeholders, the case study led to uncovering the roadblocks in practice faced by the Architecture, 
Engineering, and Construction (AEC) practitioners. This research finds that the practitioners are 
facing difficulty in: (1) Creating a shared understanding due to the lack of consensus on the Digital 
Twin concept, (2) Adapting and investing in Digital Twin due to inability to exhaustively evaluate 
and select the appropriate capabilities in a Digital Twin, and (3) Allocation of resources for Digital 
Twin development due to the inability to assess the impact of DT on the organizational conditions 
and processes. 

INTRODUCTION 

The  rise  of  digitalization  over  the  last  couple  of  decades  has  opened  new  avenues  for  the 
construction  industry  in  terms  of  value  creation  (Hampson  and  Tatum  1993).  By  providing  bi-
directional coordination between the virtual (digital) and the physical worlds, Digital Twin (DT) 
has emerged as a key concept in the digital transformation of the construction industry. It offers 
opportunities  for  dramatic  improvements  in  effectiveness  and  efficiency  through  visualization, 
information integration, and automation. 

Although  literature  reports  about  the  specific  purposes  and  various  task-related  benefits  of  DT 
(e.g.,  Khajavi  et  al.  2019;  Opoku  et  al.  2021),  little  is  known  about  the  stumbling  blocks  that

practitioners face while deploying a DT in practice. A few similar studies uncovering pragmatic 
insights from a DT deployment (e.g., Feng et al. 2020) have been conducted in the manufacturing 
industry, but nothing much exists in the AEC industry. One reason for this might be that actual DT 
development  and  deployment  happens  over  several  months,  if  not  years,  making  it  difficult  to 
conduct a longitudinal study for understanding the roadblocks in the practical deployment of a DT. 
Furthermore, the limited interest of practitioners to be willing to collaborate and give access to 
information on such a large time scale makes it even more difficult.  

This  paper  reports  the  results  from  an  ethnographic  action  research  study  on  a  real-life  DT 
deployment in the AEC industry. The article is built around the findings and observations from an 
applied case study that started with a clear set of digitalization goals and objectives. The study 
started as a digitalization implementation on a real-life project in which the clients were looking 
for an automated assessment of the health condition of the road surface and the surrounding areas 
of  an  active  tollway.  As  the  project  progressed,  discussions  emerged  about  DT  between  the 
practitioners  as  they  reflected  on  how  it  related  to  the  work  the  researcher  was  doing.  These 
discussions  raised  some  interesting  questions  and  made  the  researcher  wonder  what  are  the 
problems that practitioners face while deploying a DT in practice. 

The  study  uses  ethnographic-action  research  methodology  (Hartmann,  Fischer,  and  Haymaker 
2009)  to  report  the  findings  of  the  case  study.  Ethnographic-action  research  combines  the 
implementation of a system in practice with ethnographic observations of the practitioners. This 
type  of  research  methodology  is  particularly  relevant  in  the  construction  management  domain, 
where practical problems need to be solved simultaneously creating theoretical knowledge (Azhar, 
Ahmad, and Sein 2010). Ethnographic-action research has been popular for investigating the use 
of technology in construction projects (Oswald and Dainty 2020; Zanen et al. 2013; Mahalingam, 
Yadav, and Varaprasad 2015). In our study, results are reported based on 10-month longitudinal 
data, collected between Autumn 2018 and Summer 2019, consisting of participant observations, 
informal  discussions,  meeting  observations,  document  analysis,  and  semi-structured  interviews 
with  various  stakeholders  at  different  levels  of  management.  A  site  visit  was  also  conducted, 
permitting the research team to interact with on-field personnel, project managers, and executives 
from the Department of Transportation (DoT). In the next sections, the paper describes the DT and 
the case study background. This is followed by reporting the observations and questions arising 
from  the  case  study.    The  paper  is  concluded  with  the  discussions  of  the  findings  and  their 
implications for the AEC industry. 

DIGITAL TWIN BACKGROUND 

While the term DT has been coined recently, the concept was first introduced as ‘Mirrored Spaces 
Model’  by  Michael  Grieves  in  2002  as  a  part  of  a  university  course  on  Product  Lifecycle 
Management (Grieves and Vickers 2017). DT essentially consists of four major elements: (1) The 
physical object, (2) The virtual or the digital object, (3) Link for data flow from physical to virtual 
object, and (4) Link for data flow from virtual to physical object. The data flow between the two 
systems helps in mirroring or twinning of what exists in the real world to the virtual world and 
vice-versa. The first formal definition of the DT was formulated by NASA in 2012 (Glaessgen and 
Stargel 2012) as: “an integrated multi-physics, multi-scale, probabilistic simulation of a vehicle or 
system that uses the best available physical models, sensor updates, fleet history, etc., to mirror

the life of its flying twin”. Thereafter, owing to its usefulness, the concept has spread from the 
aerospace sector to a wider range of industries. In the manufacturing industry, DT has been used 
for applications including Product Lifecycle Management (Boschert and Rosen 2016), Production 
Planning and Control (Söderberg et al. 2017), process redesign (Schleich et al. 2017), and layout 
planning (Rosen et al. 2015). In the AEC industry, DT has been used in building operations and 
maintenance (Khajavi et al. 2019), logistics processes, and energy simulations (Opoku et al. 2021).  

CASE STUDY BACKGROUND 

The case study is focused on the  41-mile southern section (Section 5 & 6) of SH-130, a publicly 
owned toll road, privately operated and maintained by the SH-130 concession company. Opened 
in 2012, the $1.35 billion facility was built and financed by the SH-130 concession company and 
is operated and maintained under the terms of a 50-year facility concession agreement with the 
Texas  Department  of  Transportation  (TxDoT).  Interestingly,  SH-130  segments  5  &  6  have  the 
highest legal speed limit in the nation at 85 mph and uses open tolling to allow tolls to be charged 
without drivers having to slow down for a toll booth. To ensure a safe driving experience for the 
users and sustain such high speeds, timely maintenance of the roadway is required. Therefore, the 
focus of the concession company during the case study was to come up with a strategy to improve 
the efficiency of the costliest phase of the highway lifecycle: operations and maintenance.  

The developer and the operator of the road have a general obligation to maintain and operate the 
facility in accordance with good industry practice. This includes minimizing the delays for the 
users, responding as quickly as possible to incidents and defects, and protecting the safety of users 
in  and  around  the  facility.  The  performance  requirements  were  set  upfront  in  the  SH-130 
concession  agreement  by  the  Department  of  Transportation  (DoT),  indicating  the  minimum 
expected  performance  levels  and  the  defect  resolution  timing  and  procedures.  For  some 
requirements, a very stringent response time - 6 to 24 hours - was specified in the concession. 
Failing to respond adequately would result in heavy fines and risks to the life safety of the users. 
These  requirements  necessitate  a  significant  investment  into  inspection  and  maintenance 
management, including both the personnel time and resources. Therefore, the company wondered 
if digitalizing some of the ways of working can help. 

Specifically, the company was interested in investigating novel methods of data acquisition and 
data  analysis  to  develop  a  preventative  maintenance  program  to  reduce  the  TCO  (total  cost  of 
ownership) through reduced operational costs. The vision that the company had for the project 
was: “Reduction of operational costs through early detection and preventative maintenance.” New 
data  acquisition  methods  from  unmanned  aerial  imagery,  mobile  imagery,  mobile  LiDAR,  and 
unmanned LiDAR systems were explored, and machine learning techniques for automated data 
analysis were applied. Some example images taken during the project are shown in Figure-1. The 
authors  took  the  lead  on  developing  the  algorithms  to  process  real-time  data  of  the  roadway 
through  UAV  systems,  and  analyze  it  using  machine  learning.  The  resulting  prototype  was 
evaluated to understand the value it generates for the company. The prototype application as a 
result of digitalization on the project started to be called “DT for the roadway” by the practitioners 
and thereafter became the center point of discussion in the project. The project concluded with a 
successful proof of concept of the DT showcasing that the commercially available technology was 
able to identify critical performance requirements from the concession agreement. To observe the

evolution of the understanding of the DT concept by the practitioners, and different stakeholders, 
notes were made throughout the project, and minutes of meetings were recorded.

CASE STUDY FINDINGS 

Insight-1: Lack of consensus on the DT concept among the practitioners 

A lack of consensus among the practitioners about the DT concept was observed. For some people, 
the term DT implied an entirely new way of doing things with technology. And for others, DT was 
just an extension of the already existing technology like Building Information Modelling (BIM). 

Supporting Observations:

(1) The researchers observed that the practitioners found it difficult to semantically differentiate 
between the technologies: BIM, DT, BIM coupled with Internet of Things (IoT) [BIM + IoT], etc., 
and sometimes used the terms interchangeably. Some excerpts from the practitioners like: “This is 
like a BIM for horizontal projects”, “We can use sensors on the road to update the model”, etc. 
were  noted  in  the  case  study.  This  ambiguity  in  the  DT  concept  and  lack  of  its  ability  to 
differentiate from general computing models has also been suggested by (Shao and Helu 2020; 
Khajavi et al. 2019) in the manufacturing industry. 

(2) DT wasn’t even an explicit goal that the project team was initially pursuing and emerged more 
as a discussion point under the broader purview of digitalization. After the introduction of the term, 
one of the practitioners stated: “Yes, exactly we are building a DT of the road”. In the minds of 
the practitioners, they were already building a DT, and the formal introduction of the term DT 
gave  them  the  means  to  communicate  their  prototype  to  a  broader  audience.  The  researchers 
observed that practitioners were unaware of the technicalities of the term DT, and were indifferent 
if the task was executed by a BIM or a DT. 

Implications:  

The usage of DT across such a wide range of things and applications risks it being rejected by the 
people due to its vagueness and as hype (Wright and Davidson 2020). In order to have a clear 
understanding  of  the  concept  of  DT,  a  way  to  describe,  categorize  and  compare  the  different 
perspectives  is  needed.  The  authors  believe  that  articulating  the  DT  concept  more  clearly  and 
defining “Levels of Digital Twin” (Madni, Madni, and Lucero 2019) can be one of the ways that 
can help to create a hierarchy/categorization of perspectives and thus help to compare the different 
types of DT.  

Insight-2: Inability to exhaustively evaluate the capabilities of a DT 

Even though the ambition in many cases is to create the so-called “Most intelligent DT”, that can 
completely  automate  the  work  processes,  the  reality  is  that  in  the  current  practice  and  the 
foreseeable future, DT would still have limited technological capabilities. Therefore, it is important 
for the practitioners to be able to select the appropriate technological capabilities by exhaustively 
evaluating  the  various  alternatives  in  a  DT.  Towards  this  end,  the  researchers  observed  that 
practitioners are facing difficulty in selecting the appropriate technological capabilities in a DT 
while deploying it in practice.  

Supporting Observations:  

It was highlighted in one of the semi-structured interviews that the whole DT prototyping effort 
was top-down driven. The decision to use drone imagery and machine learning was more of a top 
management  fascination  with  the  drone  technology,  rather  than  an  exhaustive  evaluation  of  all 
possible  alternative  options  to  detect  the  defects  like  using  some  sensor-based  technologies, 
monitoring change in speed of vehicles, etc. Similar observations highlighting the importance of a 
clear scope definition and exhaustive evaluation have also been made in the other domains, where

(Feng et al. 2020; Shao and Helu 2020) argues that the idea that Digital Twin (DT) has to be a 
comprehensive  virtual  replica  of  all  the  physical  assets  along  with  increasingly  complex 
capabilities like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is making it difficult for 
the practitioners to adapt, invest, and deploy DT. 

Implications:  

The lack of an exhaustive evaluation of alternative options can lead to biases towards a particular 
technology and therefore result in missed opportunities. A critical evaluation of the technology, 
and questioning ‘how’ digital technologies can coalesce to generate business value and improve 
business  competitiveness  is  needed  (Love  and  Matthews  2019).  A  standardized  framework 
providing  guidelines,  methods,  and  best  practices,  can  enable  practitioners  to  leverage  DT  by 
providing a means to navigate the complex set of standards, technologies, and procedures that can 
be used for DT implementation (Shao and Helu 2020). 

Insight-3: Inability to assess the impact of DT on the organizational conditions and processes 

When the discussions shifted towards deploying the DT, the team realized that in order to get the 
benefits from the DT, they would need to change the current ways of working. The practitioners 
discussed  various  possible  changes  that  might  result  due  to  the  DT.  Although  the  practitioners 
brainstormed on the possible impacts, a structured discussion involving clear communication of 
ideas was missing. 

Supporting Observations:  

(1)  The  practitioners  discussed  that  the  process  of  creating  a  work  order  for  a  damage  repair, 
updating the digital asset model for some observed defects, closing a work order after inspection, 
etc.  can  all  be  automated  as  the  drone  would  be  able  to  detect  the  defects  and  understand  the 
changes that happen over time. The practitioners, therefore, wondered how would this affect the 
current ways of working. Some ideas that propped up included shifting the personnel dedicated to 
these tasks for more productive tasks. 

(2)  The  practitioners  also  reflected  that  owing  to  the  stringent  guidelines  for  the  road  repair, 
currently, the SH-130 concession company has to keep a large amount of inventory and contact 
individual  subcontractors  in  a  short  period  of  time  to  carry  out  the  repair  work  leading  to 
unnecessary costs for the company. Once the team moves towards a predictive maintenance system 
using drones, they can start planning in advance for the material, crew, equipment, etc. This would 
allow  the  company  to  pivot  to  a  “Just-in-time”  delivery  method  for  materials  and  equipment 
delivery, and encourage competitive bids among the subcontractors. Again many plausible impacts 
were suggested in form of educated guesses without a definite structure like changing the existing 
contracts, legal tenders, business partnerships, etc.

The benefits of DT are marginal if only superimposed on the existing construction management 
processes and organizational structures (Venkatraman 1994). The maximum benefit accrues when 
investments in DT are accompanied by the corresponding changes in the process and organization 
delivering  the  product/service.  Therefore,  a  lack  of  structured  impact  assessment  and  change 
management can lead to implementation lags and misallocation of resources. Possibly, methods 
similar to Benefits Dependency Network (Love and Matthews 2019) which provide a structured 
way to assess the changes required to sustain the technology can be used in the context of DT to 
alleviate this challenge. 

CONCLUSION 

Digitalization approaches are pragmatically determined largely by how it gets interpreted by the 
practitioners and applied in practice. Therefore, understanding the roadblocks occurring in practice 
becomes critical to lay out the guidelines for the implementation of DT in the AEC industry and 
future  academic  research.  Based  on  the  ethnographic  action  study,  three  main  roadblocks  have 
been identified and presented, with the hope, the many other similar additional insights emerge 
from future studies.  

We find that there is a lack of consensus on the DT concept in practice. As these concepts are 
critical for creating a shared understanding and communication of the digitalization goals among 
the project participants, a clear articulation of the DT definition and a framework for unifying the 
various  perspectives  is  needed.  We  also  find  that  practitioners  face  difficulty  in  exhaustively 
evaluating the varied capabilities of DT, and thus struggle with deciding the appropriate scope for 
deployment leading to difficulty in adaption and missed opportunities. Finally, we also note that 
practitioners struggle to articulate the consequent changes that need to happen in the organization 
and its processes to sustain the generated value from the DT.
