ABSTRACT
Phase curves of asteroids are typically considered to depend solely on the scattering properties of airless particulate surfaces and
the size of the object being studied. In this study, we demonstrate the additional dependence of phase curves on object shape,
rotation pole orientation, and viewing geometry over an apparition. Variations in the phase curve of near-Earth asteroid (159402)
1999 AP10 over its apparition from July 2020 - January 2021 are veriﬁed to be due to aspect changes over the apparition.
This is achieved through shape modelling of the asteroid and simulation of the phase curve over the apparition. We present
simulations of asteroid phase curves over a range of geometries to understand the potential magnitude of this aspect eﬀect, and
under which circumstances it can begin to dominate in the phase curves. This dependence on aspect may introduce signiﬁcant
additional uncertainty in the properties derived from phase curve data. We provide and demonstrate software code to estimate
the aspect-related uncertainty in near-Earth asteroid phase curves through simulation and model ﬁtting of a randomly generated
sample of ellipsoidal asteroid models over the observed viewing geometry. We demonstrate how ignoring this eﬀect may lead to
misleading interpretations of the data and underestimation of uncertainties in further studies, such as those in the infrared that
use phase curve derived parameters when ﬁtting physical properties of an asteroid.

1 INTRODUCTION

As the heliocentric distance, geocentric distance, and phase angle
(deﬁned as the angle between the Earth and Sun position vectors
as viewed from the asteroid) of an asteroid change, the observed
brightness of the asteroid viewed from Earth will change. To make
meaningful comparisons of the brightness of diﬀerent asteroids, it
is standard practice to convert the apparent magnitude to that at a
distance of 1 au from both the Earth and the Sun, referred to as the
reduced magnitude. The variation of the reduced magnitude of an
asteroid (averaged over any rotational light curve period) with chang-
ing phase angle is known as the phase curve. Phase curves allow us
to predict the apparent magnitude of an asteroid for observation plan-
ning, and gain insight into the physical properties of these objects.
The absolute magnitude (𝐻) of an asteroid, deﬁned as the mean re-
duced magnitude when observed at a phase angle of 0°, is related
to the diameter and geometric albedo of the object. The slopes of
phase curves are typically explained solely by the scattering proper-
ties of the material on asteroid surfaces. Models such as the 𝐻, 𝐺
(Bowell et al. 1989), 𝐻, 𝐺1, 𝐺2 (Muinonen et al. 2010), and 𝐻, 𝐺12
(Muinonen et al. 2010) systems aim to approximate the behaviour
of these scattering properties in a parametric manner. Fitting these
models to photometric data helps us to constrain the absolute magni-
tudes, geometric albedos, and potential taxonomic classiﬁcations of
asteroids (Bowell et al. 1989; Oszkiewicz et al. 2012; Penttilä et al.
2016).

These parametric models are unable to account for changes in
brightness of asteroids due to changing viewing aspect either during
or between apparitions. Changing viewing geometry changes the
cross-sectional area visible to the observer for an irregularly shaped
asteroid. This can impart brightness variations onto asteroid phase
curves (Rozitis et al. 2020). This means that a single set of model
parameters may not accurately represent the phase curve in other
apparitions. Aspect eﬀects are likely to be signiﬁcant for asteroids that
are irregularly shaped and experience large changes to viewing aspect
during their observable apparitions, e.g. near-Earth asteroids (NEAs).
Shape-induced modulations to phase curves may limit the taxonomic
information that can be extracted from ﬁts using parametric phase
curve models. The usage of the 𝐺12 parameter alone to estimate the
classiﬁcations of individual asteroids has been shown to provide poor
results (Oszkiewicz et al. 2012), and aspect eﬀects would compound
these issues further.

Sparse observations of near-Earth asteroids used to construct phase
curves (for example from large scale surveys) that are aﬀected by as-
pect eﬀects will result in signiﬁcant errors introduced into estimates
of absolute magnitudes and slope parameters (𝐺, 𝐺1 and 𝐺2, or
𝐺12). This may cause large errors to propagate into diameter esti-
mates and predictions of future brightness. Errors in phase curve
properties of asteroids hinder accurate derivation of thermophysical
properties of their surfaces through models such as the Near-Earth
Asteroid Thermophysical Model (NEATM; Harris 1998) or the Ad-
vanced Thermophysical Model (ATPM; Rozitis & Green 2011). The
presence of large-scale errors in sizes of individual objects also has
natural consequences for planetary defence mitigation planning if

only photometric data are available (i.e. the object is initially too
distant for planetary radar).

The deﬁnitions of “reference phase curves” (Kaasalainen et al.
2001) and “proper phase curves” (Muinonen et al. 2020) make use
of convex shape models and rotation pole solutions to correct phase
curves to equatorial viewing geometry, following on from similar
work using triaxial ellipsoids by Drummond et al. (1988). Mottola
et al. (2020) extract the “reference phase curve” for the Lucy mis-
sion target (11351) Leucus in order to remove shape and viewing
geometry eﬀects from the results using a derived shape model from
photometric light curve and occultation observations. Inversion of a
large collection of ground-based and Gaia asteroid photometric data
was performed by Martikainen et al. (2021) to correct for aspect
changes to the phase curves through: extraction of the intrinsic shape
and scattering properties of the surface, simulation of the “proper
phase curve”, and subsequent ﬁtting of the 𝐻, 𝐺1, 𝐺2 system to
the simulated data. However, large photometric light curve data sets
suitable for shape estimation via inversion methods are not typically
available for most near-Earth asteroids. Therefore for those objects
where inversion is not practical, we must understand the additional
uncertainty introduced into the interpretation of near-Earth asteroid
phase curves that may be impacted by aspect changes throughout or
between apparitions.

In this paper, we aim to characterise how aspect changes may aﬀect
the interpretation of phase curves for objects where inversion is not
possible. Section 2 outlines the scattering model and model parame-
ters used throughout this study. In Section 3, we report the detection
of aspect change eﬀects on the phase curve of near-Earth asteroid
(159402) 1999 AP10, and verify this is an aspect eﬀect through con-
vex inversion to determine the shape and subsequent simulation of
the phase curve over the observed apparition. In Section 4, we discuss
simulations of asteroid phase curves over artiﬁcial and real asteroid
orbits to examine their behaviour and understand the potential mag-
nitude of this eﬀect on other near-Earth asteroids. Section 5 details
software code designed to estimate the aspect-related uncertainty in
individual asteroid phase curves based on the geometry over which
the asteroids were observed. As an example of the signiﬁcance of
this additional uncertainty, we use this software to present updated
uncertainties for the phase curve parameters of the near-Earth As-
teroids (8014) 1990 MF and (19764) 2000 NF5 originally observed
and derived by Jackson et al. (2021a). In Section 6, we report on
the implications that this eﬀect may have on studies across various
wavelength ranges, such as thermophysical modelling.

2 HAPKE MODEL AND PARAMETERS

In this study, we use the Hapke photometric model (Hapke 2012) to
simulate the brightness of an asteroid shape model at a given viewing

geometry. The principle details of the model are reproduced within
this section. A summary of the symbols and parameters used within
the Hapke model equations can be found in Table 1. The Hapke model
parameters assumed in our simulations for the two major taxonomic
groups in the near-Earth asteroid regime (S- & C-type) can be found
in Table 2.

We calculate the bidirectional reﬂectance – the “ratio of the scat-
tered radiance towards the observer to the collimated incident irra-
diance” (Li et al. 2015) – of each facet on the surface of the asteroid
as

𝑟𝑏𝑖 =

𝜇𝑒 + 𝜇0𝑒

(1)

𝜇0𝑒 and 𝜇𝑒 are the eﬀective cosines of the angles of incidence and
emission respectively. The eﬀective cosines are the mathematical
cosines (Eqns. 2 & 3) of the angles with a correction applied to
account for global surface roughness (Hapke 1984).

𝜇0 = cos 𝑖,
= cos 𝑒.
𝜇

(2)

(3)

The mathematical formulation of the eﬀective cosines is outlined in
Appendix A. 𝐵(𝛼, 𝐵0, ℎ) is the opposition eﬀect function (Hapke
1986), which represents the non-linear surge in brightness as an
asteroid approaches a phase angle of zero. 𝑝(𝛼, 𝑔) is the single-
particle phase function (Henyey & Greenstein 1941), which controls
the phase dependence of the brightness at higher phase angles away
from the opposition eﬀect. 𝐻 (𝑥, 𝜔) is an approximation that rep-
resents multiple scattering (Hapke 1981), where incident light is
scattered oﬀ neighbouring particles at microscopic scales before ar-
riving at the observer location. This approximation is found to be
valid to within 3 per cent of the numerically evaluated exact form of
the Chandrasekhar (1960) H-function over all possible values (Hapke
1981), and so is preferred over the numerically evaluated form for
simplicity. The rough surface shadowing correction 𝑆(𝑖, 𝑒, 𝜓, ¯𝜃) de-
scribes the modiﬁcation to the bidirectional reﬂectance for surface
roughness on scales larger than the particle size (Hapke 2012). All
of the functions in Eq. 1 are deﬁned in full in Appendix A.

The solar ﬂux at the asteroid is calculated by scaling the solar ﬂux
at 1 au, 𝑆𝜆 = 1.896 W m−2 nm−1 at 545 nm (Gueymard 2004), by the
square of the heliocentric distance of the asteroid, 𝑟, in au,

𝑆𝜆,𝑟 =

𝑆𝜆
𝑟2

.

The facet ﬂux as seen by the observer, 𝐹, is then calculated as

𝐹𝑖 =

𝑆𝜆,𝑟 · 𝑟𝑏𝑖 · 𝐴 · cos(𝑒)
Δ2

,

(4)

(5)

where Δ is the geocentric distance of the asteroid in metres, 𝑟𝑏𝑖 is
the bidirectional reﬂectance as detailed previously (𝑠𝑟−1), 𝐴 is the
facet area in square metres, and 𝑒 is the viewing angle of the facet
(equivalent to the reﬂection angle of the observed ray from the facet).
Illumination by the Sun and visibility to the observer (accounting
for shadowing by other facets) of each facet of the shape model is

crosses in Figure 2.

(159402) 1999 AP10 is a near-Earth asteroid with an Amor or-
bit classiﬁcation. Radar, thermal-IR, and many light curve studies
have been conducted on this asteroid to date. Hasegawa et al. (2018)
derive a synodic rotation period of 7.911 ± 0.0001 hours, in agree-
ment with the synodic period of 7.908 ± 0.001 hours from Franco
et al. (2010). This is also consistent with more recent observations by
Warner & Stephens (2021), who report synodic rotation periods of
7.9219 ± 0.0003 hours and 7.9144 ± 0.0004 hours. The small diﬀer-
ences in derived periods across these studies is largely due to these
being synodic rather than sidereal rotation periods, i.e. the intrinsic
rotation period is modiﬁed by the changing viewing geometry over
the observations. Warner & Stephens (2021) also report the poten-
tial detection of a secondary rotation period from their light curve
observations, although the secondary period is not well constrained
and is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent when using diﬀerent data sets. To inves-
tigate whether a secondary body is present, we viewed four hours of
delay-Doppler radar data2 (Lunar and Planetary Institute 2021) and
ﬁnd no evidence of a secondary. This means that either the secondary
was behind the main body, is too small to be detected at this radar
resolution (30 m px−1), is out of frame, or is not present. For the
purposes of this study, we do not consider the presence of a binary,
and any such binary would be too small to inﬂuence the conclusions
presented in this work (contributing ≤ 0.004 mag to the observed
magnitude). We also ﬁnd no evidence of a secondary in the 75 m-
resolution Goldstone delay-Doppler data3, which provides another
geometry to help constrain the presence or absence of a secondary.
Warm Spitzer observations give a diameter estimate of 1.20 ±
0.29 km (Trilling et al. 2010; Mueller et al. 2011), inconsistent with
a radar-derived diameter of 2.068 km (Lunar and Planetary Institute
2021). Since radar data provide a more direct measurement of the
sizes of solar system bodies, we prefer this diameter in our analysis.
From the warm Spitzer data the following additional parameters are
derived: a geometric albedo of 0.35 ± 0.24 (Thomas et al. 2011),
and an Sq classiﬁcation (Thomas et al. 2014) in the Bus-DeMeo
taxonomic system. Spectroscopic data from the MIT-Hawaii Near-
Earth Object Spectroscopic Survey suggests an Sw classiﬁcation
(Binzel et al. 2019), whereas other spectroscopic results suggest
either an L- or S-type classiﬁcation (Hicks & Lawrence 2009; Hicks
et al. 2009). The circular polarisation ratio from the radar continuous
wave spectrum (SC/OC = 0.26; Lunar and Planetary Institute 2021)
is consistent with an S-type classiﬁcation (Benner et al. 2008).

After the observing run with PIRATE, a phase curve was con-
structed from the data. It was observed that diﬀerent parts of the
apparition produced diﬀerent slopes on the phase curve. Due to the
rapidly changing viewing geometry during the apparition it was pro-
posed that this variation in the phase curve could be due to shape
eﬀects at diﬀerent viewing aspects. To investigate this possibility,
relative light curves from PIRATE were combined with the PDO
light curves to produce a convex shape model. To achieve this, the
convexinv software package was used (Durech et al. 2010), which
aims to approximate the shape and pole orientation of an asteroid

of the ATPM (Rozitis & Green 2011). The ﬂux from each facet is
calculated for and summed over all facets that are both illuminated
and visible, then converted into a reduced magnitude in the Johnson

where 𝑉0 = 3.631 × 10−11 W m−2 nm−1 is the zero-point ﬂux in the
Johnson V-band (Bessell et al. 1998), and 𝑟 and Δ are in au. We can
therefore simulate the reduced magnitude of any deﬁned shape at a
given geometry over each step in its light curve to obtain the expected
average reduced magnitude at each point on its phase curve.

We verify the performance and accuracy of our implementation
of the Hapke photometric model through simulation of the phase
curve of the OSIRIS-REx target (101955) Bennu. This is achieved
through comparison of the photometric data from Hergenrother et al.
(2013) to a spherical model simulated using the Hapke scattering
parameters derived by Takir et al. (2015). This model phase curve,
over-plotted with the photometric data, is shown in Figure 1. The
simulated phase curve well matches the photometric data and the
Hapke model presented in Figure 4 of Takir et al. (2015), verifying
the implementation of the model.

3 CONVEX SHAPE MODELLING AND PHASE CURVE

VARIABILITY OF (159402) 1999 AP10

As part of an ongoing near-Earth asteroid observation program with
the Physics Innovations Robotic Telescope Explorer (PIRATE; de-
scribed in Kolb et al. 2018; Jackson et al. 2021a), the NEA
(159402) 1999 AP10 was observed over 38 nights from July 2020 -
January 2021 with ~212 hours of photometric data. The data were
reduced and calibrated according to the processes set out by Jackson
et al. (2021a). The observational coverage with PIRATE is marked by
the yellow points over-plotted on top of the ephemerides (black line)
in Figure 2. The asteroid was also observed during this apparition
at Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO) by Warner & Stephens (2021).

through convex inversion techniques (Kaasalainen & Torppa 2001;
Kaasalainen et al. 2001).

To model the shape, a pole scan is performed following procedures
established in Rożek et al. (2019a,b) and Zegmott et al. (2021).
This involves setting up a grid of possible pole positions covering
the entire celestial sphere in a 2° × 2° grid. An initial estimate of
the sidereal rotation period came from a convexinv period scan
of the photometric data, searching for solutions consistent with the
previously reported synodic rotation periods. For each pole in the
grid, the shape and period is optimised using convexinv to minimise
the deviation between the model and observed light curves. The 𝜒2
statistic between the observed light curves and the model light curves
from the optimised shape is recorded for each pole, to create a 2-D 𝜒2
plane as shown in Figure 3. The pole (and corresponding optimised
convex shape and sidereal rotation period) with the minimum 𝜒2
value is taken as the best solution. The yellow cross in the ﬁgure
represents the minimum 𝜒2 solution. The solid contour encompasses
solutions within 1 per cent of the minimum 𝜒2, the dotted contour
encompasses those within 5 per cent, and the dashed encompasses
those within 10 per cent. The uncertainty on the pole solution beyond
the 1 per cent contour is quite large due to the limited observational
coverage over one apparition.

This gives a pole solution for this object at 𝜆1 = 8±4°, 𝛽1 = −36±
2°, with a sidereal rotation period of 7.9214 ± 0.0008h (uncertainties
correspond to 1 per cent contours in the 𝜒2 plane), and with 𝜒2 =
2.193. A second potential pole solution within the 5 per cent contour
is found at 𝜆2 = 140 ± 4°, 𝛽2 = −30 ± 2°, with a 𝜒2 value of
2.298. For the purposes of this study we only consider the best pole
solution, and state the second for reference. There exist additional
light curve data from the last bright apparition in 2009, although
these data cover an almost identical range of viewing geometries
and are therefore of limited use in further constraining the pole. The

period is also already constrained well enough to justify not including
the 2009 data. The optimised convex shape is shown in Figure 4,
and the model light curves are shown plotted with the real data in
Figure S1 in the supplementary online material. The sidereal rotation
period derived in this work is consistent with the synodic periods
reported previously, and the retrograde pole solution is consistent
with predictions of retrograde rotation by Warner & Stephens (2021)
due to the change in synodic rotation period over the apparition.

Once the shape model for this asteroid was obtained, we simulated
the reduced magnitude of the asteroid over its apparition using the
shape model and S-type parameters in the Hapke photometric model
described in Section 2. As the phase curve uses rotationally averaged
data, a convex model is suﬃcient to reconstruct the data and therefore
a radar shape model is not required for this level of analysis. The
reduced magnitudes simulated using the model are plotted on the
phase curve alongside the calibrated photometric data from PIRATE
in Figure 5(a). The colour of the points and the line corresponds to the
date of observation, with the colour changing from purple to yellow
as the apparition progressed from 2020-07-29 to 2021-01-24. The
simulated phase curve accurately reconstructs the observed data and
associated deviations over the apparition. The deviations of both the
data and the simulated phase curve from the best-ﬁt 𝐻𝐺 model are
plotted in Figure 5(c), helping to demonstrate the divergence from
a typical phase curve. In these ﬁgures, the simulated data is shifted
vertically by a small amount to compensate for diﬀerences between
the assumed eﬀective albedo in the model (from the assumed S-type
parameters) and the actual albedo of this asteroid. This shift also
compensates for uncertainty in the radar-derived diameter.

As an explanation of the source of the aspect-related deviations
over the phase curve, we plot in Figure 5(b) a quantity we deﬁne
as the ‘ﬂux latitude’ (𝜓ﬂux) against phase angle, with colour corre-
sponding to Julian Date as before. The ﬂux latitude is deﬁned as
the ﬂux-weighted mean latitude of illuminated shape model facets
visible by the observer. This tells us from which latitude the ﬂux
is predominantly being observed, i.e. it can tell us whether we are

We see that over the apparition, the ﬂux latitude changes by approxi-
mately 50 degrees. At the beginning of the apparition the observer is
mainly seeing ﬂux from the southern hemisphere of this asteroid, but
as the apparition progresses this shifts towards the northern hemi-
sphere. The hemispherical asymmetry in the shape of this object
therefore triggers aspect-related deviations in the phase curve.

4 ASPECT CHANGE SIMULATIONS

4.1 Artiﬁcial Viewing Geometries

Following our detection of variability in the phase curve of (159402)
1999 AP10, an investigation was conducted into the potential eﬀects
this may have on the interpretation of the large collection of pho-
tometric data available for near-Earth asteroids. The scale at which
this eﬀect may occur and how it may manifest itself under vari-
ous circumstances must be characterised through simulation in order
to understand the potential eﬀect in photometric observations. To
achieve this, 21 ellipsoidal shape models were created from 2048
facets with: a 1 km volumetric diameter, various ellipsoid parame-
ters and pole orientations. A single spherical model is also created
as a control (aspect changes will have no eﬀect on the phase curve of
a spherical object). The parameters and ecliptic pole coordinates of

these ellipsoids are detailed in Table 3. These ellipsoid models were
simulated over two artiﬁcial, but useful, viewing geometries. The
ﬁrst involved keeping the asteroid stationary at a heliocentric dis-
tance 𝑟 = 1.0001 au while the Earth sweeps by interior to the orbital
distance of the asteroid (Figure 6a, referred to herein as orientation
1). The second geometry assumes the Earth is ﬁxed and the asteroid,
with an orbital inclination 𝑖 = 90◦ and 𝑟 = 1.0001 au, sweeps from
South to North (Figure 6b, referred to herein as orientation 2). Both
of these geometries allow for a pre- and post-opposition phase curve
to be simulated with a phase angle range covering 90° – 0° – 90°. As
before with (159402) 1999 AP10, all reduced magnitudes were sim-
ulated using the Hapke photometric model with S-type parameters
and rotationally averaged.

In the case of orientation 1, a selection of three models are shown
in Figure 7. All of the simulations over this geometry can be found
in Figure S2 in the supplementary online material. Each sub-ﬁgure
contains the simulated phase curve data and a ﬁt to the data using the
𝐻, 𝐺 photometric system. The ﬁtted 𝐻 and 𝐺 parameters are dis-
played in the legend of each ﬁgure. The ﬁrst model is the spherical
control, which shows the expected 𝐺 parameter for the S-type Hapke
parameters simulated. The second model is an elongated object with
its rotation pole in the ecliptic, resulting in a phase curve which de-
viates from that of the spherical control model. The third model is
elongated, and introduces hemispherical asymmetry in the same way

the aspect-related deviations of the phase curve in the upper panel due to the shape diﬀerential between the hemispheres of this asteroid. (c) Deviations from the

as Cellino et al. (1989), with a pole orientation in the ecliptic once
again. This results not only in further deviations from the spher-
ical control, but deviations between the pre- and post-opposition
phase curves for the same object. This indicates that not only can
phase curves deviate for diﬀerent shapes despite having the same
surface scattering properties, but the same object can show diﬀerent
phase curves within a single apparition. These results are consistent
with similar simulations of asteroid phase curves by Kwiatkowski &
Kryszczynska (1992).

A sample of three models from orientation 2 is shown in Figure 8.
All of the simulations over this geometry can be found in Figure S3 in
the supplementary online material. Once again the spherical control
is the ﬁrst model, and is consistent with that from orientation 1 as
expected. The second model again introduces elongation and puts the
pole orientation perpendicular to the ecliptic, resulting in a deviation
from the spherical control. The third model (elongated, hemispherical
asymmetry, and pole 45 degrees to the ecliptic) shows a drastic diﬀer-
ence between pre- and post-opposition phase curves. As an example
of how much this may aﬀect existing methodology for interpreting
individual asteroid phase curves, we attempt taxonomic classiﬁca-
tion of the simulated object based on the two phase curves for pre-
and post-opposition in Figure 8c using the single parameter taxo-
nomic ﬁtting method from Penttilä et al. (2016). Using this method
we obtain: a C-type classiﬁcation for the pre-opposition phase curve,
and an E-type classiﬁcation for the post-opposition phase curve. The
timing of when the asteroid is observed during the apparition drives
the taxonomic classiﬁcation using this method in this example. This
eﬀect therefore severely limits the taxonomic information present in
near-Earth asteroid phase curves. Care must be taken when trying
to extract this information from phase curves, and should typically
be supported by spectroscopic or spectro-photometric observations.
The large-scale separation of the phase curve at higher phase angles
in Figure 8c highlights the importance of this eﬀect for near-Earth as-

teroid phase curves, where higher phase angle data is more common
than for main belt asteroids.

A potential solution to minimise the eﬀect of aspect changes on
phase curves was thought to be to deﬁne the phase curves not as the
average brightness variation with phase angle, but instead to deﬁne
them as the maximum brightness variation with phase angle. For each
of the simulations and geometries described previously, we compared
the average brightness phase curve to the spherical control (the ‘true’
phase curve for the selected Hapke parameters). We also compared
the maximum brightness phase curves to the spherical control. In
these simulations we see no evidence that the maximum brightness
phase curve is better in general at reproducing the spherical con-
trol. Simulations of maximum brightness asteroid phase curves by
Kwiatkowski & Kryszczynska (1992) result in similar eﬀects to those
shown in Fig. 7c, and hence these eﬀects are not removed through
the use of maximum brightness phase curves. In Figure 9, we present
two example scenarios where we have compared the average bright-
ness phase curve to the spherical control, and similarly compared the
maximum brightness phase curve to the spherical control. These two
simulations provide a stark example of how changing one parameter
in the simulation (here it is the 𝑏 ellipsoid parameter) can change
whether the average brightness or maximum brightness phase curves
provide a better approximation to the spherical control. Using maxi-
mum brightness phase curves therefore does not provide an adequate
solution to the problem, and phase curves should continue to be

(Helfenstein & Veverka 1989).

4.2 Simulating Over Real Asteroid Geometries

While it is useful to visualise the worst-case scenarios that may be ob-
served in near-Earth asteroid phase curves, the geometries described
previously are not representative of typical orbits. As an example
of how this eﬀect may present itself during an apparition of a real
NEA, we investigate the eﬀect over the apparition of (19764) 2000
NF5 from June to October 2020. To do this, four thousand random
ellipsoidal models were generated with random pole orientations.
In the absence of an unbiased NEA shape distribution in the liter-
ature, the ellipsoidal models were randomly chosen from uniform
distributions on the ellipsoid parameters (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐1, and 𝑐2), while
maintaining 𝑎 > 𝑏 and 𝑎, 𝑏 > 𝑐1, 𝑐2. The pole orientations were
sampled using a uniform distribution in longitude, and an obliquity
distribution from Tardioli et al. (2017). We then simulated the phase
curve of each test object using the Hapke photometric model and S-
type parameters described previously. It was noted that in ~26.6 per
cent of simulations, the phase curve underwent a reversal in direction
at or around a phase angle of 50°, i.e. the reduced magnitude began
to decrease with larger phase angle. These reversals arise solely from
aspect changes over the apparition. Due to the changes in aspect, the
cross-sectional area illuminated and visible by the observer rapidly

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2022)

changed. This imparted brightness variations on the simulated phase
curve that dominate over the expected reduction in brightness due to
typical phase curve behaviour of a single consolidated body, hence
we see an increase in brightness on the simulated phase curve with
increasing phase angle.

An example of one of these simulations where the phase curve
reversed in direction can be found in Figure 10 (blue points, upper
panel). An example of one of the simulations where there was no
reversal, i.e. the phase curve showed ‘normal’ behaviour, is illustrated
by the red points in the same ﬁgure. In the lower panel of Figure 10,
we plot the ﬂux latitude against phase angle to conﬁrm the cause
of the reversal in the phase curve. For the reversal case, the ﬂux
latitude changes rapidly at the same time as the reversal in the phase
curve, indicating we are rapidly sampling diﬀerent parts of the shape.
There is minimal change in the ﬂux latitude for the model that did
not undergo any reversal in the phase curve. This shows that it is
the aspect-driven brightness variations that cause these reversals in
the phase curve as described previously. This demonstrates the large
eﬀect that changing aspect can have on phase curves.

To analyse under what scenarios the reversals in the phase curves
occurred across all models, we plotted the pole coordinates of all
of the test objects that provided a reversal (Figure 11). The relative
lack of reversals with the pole in the ecliptic is a result of the input
distribution instead of any geometric eﬀects over the simulated ap-
parition. The pole longitudes are focused in two regions, between 50°

Figure 9. Left Panel: Diﬀerence between the averaged phase curve and the spherical control (blue), and diﬀerence between the maximum brightness phase
curve and the spherical control (red). Simulated asteroid is elongated by the ellipsoid 𝑎 parameter. In this case the average light phase curve provides the best
approximation to the spherical control. Right Panel: Same as the left panel, however the shape of the simulated asteroid is altered slightly in the 𝑏 parameter.
In this case the maximum brightness phase curve provides the best approximation to the spherical control. Whether or not the maximum brightness phase curve
improves the approximation to the ‘real’ phase curve is highly variable and can change with the slightest variation in shape of the asteroid, and is therefore not a
viable solution to the problems posed by aspect changes.

- 120° and between 235° - 310°. This is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
the uniform input distribution, and indicates that under this geometry
the phase curves are heavily dependent on the pole coordinates. The
largest reversals in the phase curve occurred with the pole latitude
near to the ecliptic, which over this geometry results in large scale
changes to the ﬂux latitude and hence large aspect-related eﬀects in
the phase curves. The overall distribution of pole latitudes does not
deviate signiﬁcantly from the input distribution, except for the lack of
poles perpendicular to the ecliptic where hemispherical asymmetry
has no eﬀect under this geometry.

5 ESTIMATING ASPECT RELATED UNCERTAINTY IN

PHASE CURVE PARAMETERS

We note in the previous sections that the magnitude of aspect eﬀects
is highly dependent on viewing geometry and pole orientation. This
means that a generalised approach to estimate a single aspect-related
uncertainty in all asteroid phase curves is not possible. We have
developed software written in c++ and Python that aims to estimate
this uncertainty for asteroid phase curves on an individual basis
for asteroids for which no information on shape, pole orientation
or spectral type is available. Using the same process outlined in
Section 4.2, one thousand ellipsoidal models are generated with pole
orientations according to the outlined input distributions. The models
are all scaled such that the ﬂuxes are equivalent to an object with a
1 km volumetric diameter.

The user provides an input geometry ﬁle containing: the heliocen-
tric range, heliocentric longitude, heliocentric latitude, geocentric
range, geocentric longitude, geocentric latitude, and photometric un-
certainty of the asteroid on each date on which it was observed in
the real phase curve. The uncertainties are used to maintain con-
sistency between constraining the best ﬁt parameters for each sim-
ulation and for the real photometric data. The phase curve of the
object is then simulated over this geometry using both S- and C-type
Hapke scattering parameters, using the model and parameters out-

lined in Section 2. We ﬁt the 𝐻, 𝐺 parameters to each simulated
phase curve using non-linear least squares ﬁtting implemented in the
SciPy python package (Virtanen et al. 2020). The standard deviation
in each of the ﬁtted phase curve parameters across all 1000 mod-
els is recorded as the aspect-related uncertainty for that parameter,
𝜎𝐻 , aspect & 𝜎𝐺, aspect. This process is done for models with both
S- and C-type Hapke scattering parameters. S-type simulations show
greater aspect eﬀects due to the increased multiple scattering present
on these surfaces. The standard deviations in the ﬁtted parameters are
recorded for both taxonomies. The mean of these standard deviations
is calculated across the two taxonomies, weighted by the taxonomic
proportion of the NEA population, as the ﬁnal aspect uncertainties.
These uncertainties should then be added in quadrature with any
other uncertainties in the phase curve (e.g. statistical ﬁt uncertain-
ties). The latest release of the code can be accessed and downloaded
from doi:10.5281/zenodo.6062631, where some example input ﬁles
are provided alongside instructions on compiling and running the
code. For objects where minor constraints on the shape are known
(i.e. a minimum light curve amplitude giving a minimum 𝑎/𝑏 axis
ratio) then this minimum light curve amplitude can be provided to
the code to only generate shapes that match this criteria. For ob-
jects with a well-constrained shape and pole, the methods outlined
by (Muinonen et al. 2020) to obtain the ‘ideal phase curve’ are more
suitable. If the spectral type of the asteroid is known, the code can
be edited to provide suitable Hapke parameters for the simulations.

As an example of the signiﬁcance of this additional uncertainty,
we present updated uncertainties for the two example phase curves
from Jackson et al. (2021a). In that work, the authors report the un-
certainties for (8014) 1990 MF as 𝜎𝐻 = 0.047 mag and 𝜎𝐺 = 0.024.
Using the process outlined in this work, we derive aspect-related un-
certainties of 𝜎𝐻 , aspect = 0.15 mag and 𝜎𝐺, aspect = 0.07, bringing
the total uncertainty in the phase curve parameters to 𝜎𝐻 , total = 0.16
mag and 𝜎𝐺, total = 0.07. The uncertainties for (19764) 2000 NF5
are reported as 𝜎𝐻 = 0.047 mag and 𝜎𝐺 = 0.022. Using the pro-
cess outlined in this work, we derive aspect-related uncertainties
of 𝜎𝐻 , aspect = 0.27 mag and 𝜎𝐺, aspect = 0.14, bringing the total

of the phase curve of an ellipsoidal model over the orbit of (19764) 2000
NF5 that does not undergo a reversal in the phase curve. The blue points
are an example of a simulation of the phase curve of an ellipsoidal model
over the orbit of (19764) 2000 NF5 that undergoes a reversal against the
typical phase curve direction due to aspect eﬀects. Data collected at these
points in the phase curve can be signiﬁcantly misleading in the analysis of
the phase curve parameters derived from these data. Lower Panel: Change
in ﬂux latitude over the simulated apparition for both models. For the model
with phase curve reversal, the change in the ﬂux latitude is signiﬁcant over
the apparition, which leads to the aspect eﬀects we see in the phase curve.
For the case with no observed reversal in the phase curve, the ﬂux latitude
is not observed to change rapidly, and hence aspect eﬀects are not as clearly
visible in the simulated phase curve.

uncertainty in the phase curve parameters to 𝜎𝐻 , total = 0.27 mag
and 𝜎𝐺, total = 0.14. The aspect-related uncertainties dominate over
the statistical ﬁt uncertainties, and therefore should not be neglected
when analysing phase curves of individual near-Earth asteroids.

6 CONSEQUENCES OF ASPECT-INDUCED VARIABILITY

As indicated in Section 4.1, taxonomic classiﬁcation of near-Earth
asteroids using phase curve data is limited by potential aspect eﬀects.
Aspect eﬀects in phase curves may also propagate signiﬁcant extra
uncertainties into various other studies of these objects. A primary
eﬀect will be on brightness predictions for future apparitions, po-
tentially hindering observation planning. The eﬀect on brightness
predictions could also impact space-based intercept and rendezvous
missions which rely on camera imaging for guidance and naviga-
tion control. Geometric eﬀects have already been shown to aﬀect
unresolved reﬂectance spectroscopy of asteroids (Potin et al. 2022).
For most near-Earth asteroids, low phase angle ranges are not

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2022)

commonly well-sampled in the phase curves, making estimations
of absolute magnitudes highly uncertain. This is compounded by
the fact that the slope being ﬁt may be modulated by aspect related
changes, introducing much larger uncertainty in the absolute mag-
nitudes derived from NEA phase curves. This will have a knock-on
eﬀect on the estimation of diameters, as calculated from the absolute
magnitudes and geometric albedos according to Equation 7 (Fowler
& Chillemi 1992).

Accurate determination of diameters is important for a range of stud-
ies of individual objects. Collisional dynamics, both in the outer
solar system and for planetary defense purposes, will depend heavily
on the size of these objects. To calculate the total delta-V required
for deﬂection missions of potentially hazardous asteroids, accurate
diameters are needed in conjunction with typical bulk densities to
estimate the masses of the objects. The ability of the Probabilistic
Asteroid Impact Risk (PAIR) model to estimate impact consequences
also relies on input distributions for 𝐻 (Mathias et al. 2017), and will
therefore be limited further by the increased uncertainty in 𝐻 for
a given impactor if only photometric data are available. Yarkovsky
and YORP modelling of individual objects both depend on estimated
diameters as ∝ 1
𝐷2 respectively (Vokrouhlický et al. 2015).
Consequently both of these have strong dependence on absolute mag-
nitudes for objects where only photometric data are available. Once
again this is important in the realm of planetary defense, as if we take
the example of (99942) Apophis then predictions of the Yarkovsky
drift of this object are needed to constrain the evolution of the orbit
beyond the close encounter in 2029 (Farnocchia et al. 2013). This ob-
ject has a radar derived diameter, although for a less-studied object the
uncertainty in the diameter may begin to dominate in the Yarkovsky
drift modelling. Phase curves can also be used to detect activity from
‘active asteroids’ (e.g., Mommert et al. 2020). Systematic errors in
predicted brightness of these objects can therefore signiﬁcantly over
or under-estimate the level of activity on these objects.

𝐷 and ∝ 1

Another area where aspect eﬀects may disrupt accurate modelling
is in the infrared regime. Thermophysical models such as the NEATM
(Harris 1998) use phase curve parameters in the modelling process to
extract physical properties of asteroids. From the thermal modelling
process using NEATM outlined in Rożek et al. (2019a), the geometric
albedo (𝑝𝑉 ) is re-arranged in terms of the eﬀective diameter and
absolute magnitude, and the Bond albedo (𝐴𝐵) is written in terms of
the phase curve slope parameter and the geometric albedo. The sub-
solar temperature (𝑇SS) in the NEATM can therefore be re-arranged
as follows:

where 𝑆 (cid:12) is the integrated solar ﬂux at the distance of the asteroid, 𝜖
is the emissivity, 𝜂 is the thermal beaming parameter, 𝜎 is the Stefan-
Boltzmann constant, 𝐷eq. is the diameter of an equivalent volume
spherical asteroid, and 𝐻 & 𝐺 are the phase curve parameters as
usual. The output distributions of 𝑝𝑉 and 𝐴𝐵 will heavily depend on
the input distributions for 𝐻 and 𝐺 in the bootstrap process, and any
increase in the uncertainty in the input distributions will propagate
through and increase the uncertainty in thermally-derived geometric
albedos and beaming parameters from the NEATM.

As an example of the consequences of this additional uncertainty
on geometric albedos derived from NEATM, we perform thermal
modelling of (19764) 2000 NF5 using WISE data taken in the W3
and W4 bands. For objects where phase curve parameters were not

Figure 11. Pole orientations of models which showed a reversal in the phase curve when simulated over the 2020 apparition of (19764) 2000 NF5. Sizes of
the individual points correspond to the magnitude of the reversal in the phase curve, with the largest reversals occurring with pole orientations close to the
ecliptic. Distribution of the pole latitudes largely follows that of the input distribution, except for an absence of reversals with poles perpendicular to the ecliptic.
Distribution of pole longitudes deviates strongly from the uniform input distribution, with only two groups of pole longitudes able to create reversals in the phase

known, the WISE team assume values and uncertainties according
to the ﬁrst line of Table 4. Doing so results in a thermally derived
geometric albedo, 𝑝𝑉 = 0.270±0.080. Jackson et al. (2021a) derived
a phase curve for this asteroid, and so the input distributions of 𝐻
and 𝐺 were deﬁned using the measured parameters as the means,
and the statistical ﬁt uncertainties used as the standard deviations
(second line of Table 4). This analysis gives a geometric albedo
𝑝𝑉 = 0.211 ± 0.021, within the uncertainty range of the values
derived using the WISE-assumed phase curve parameters. In theory,
this has allowed us to better constrain the geometric albedo, reducing
the uncertainty signiﬁcantly. However, this does not account for the
aspect related uncertainties in the phase curve over this geometry. We
therefore re-analyse the thermal data using the combined statistical
and aspect uncertainties derived in Section 5 (also provided in the
third line of Table 4), giving a value 𝑝𝑉 = 0.217 ± 0.058.

The percentage uncertainty in the geometric albedo drops sig-
niﬁcantly if we use derived phase curve parameters in the ﬁtting.
However, once we properly account for the systematic uncertainty
of aspect eﬀects, the percentage uncertainty becomes comparable to
that using the assumed values commonly used by the WISE team. We
can therefore not say that we have constrained the properties of this
asteroid better with a derived phase curve than without any phase
curve data. Aspect-related uncertainty in the phase curves should

therefore be accounted for when performing analysis of thermal IR
data to avoid over-ﬁtting and underestimating systematics.

The limited predictive power of the phase curves for brightness
predictions also has further implications for thermal modelling in the
infrared transition region (2.5 − 5 µm). In this region the IR ﬂux at
the detector consists of both reﬂected and emitted components. In
order to model physical properties of the surface from the emitted
component, the reﬂected ﬂux must ﬁrst be removed from the obser-
vations. This involves using 𝐻 and 𝐺 to predict the brightness of the
asteroid at the given phase angle, and estimating the reﬂected ﬂux

where 𝐹REF,𝜆 is the reﬂected component of the IR ﬂux, 𝑝𝜆 is the
geometric albedo of the asteroid at the observed wavelength, 𝑝𝑉 is
the geometric albedo in the Johnson V-band, 𝑆𝜆 is the solar ﬂux at
1 au at the observed wavelength, 𝑉SUN is the Johnson V magnitude of
the Sun at 1 au, and 𝑉 is the predicted (using the 𝐻 and 𝐺 phase curve
parameters) apparent magnitude of the asteroid as viewed from Earth.
Rozitis et al. (2018) ﬁnd that under some geometries, the reﬂected
component can account for up to several tens of per cent of the total
IR ﬂux received at the detector. These brightness predictions from the
phase curves have the ability to massively over- or under-estimate the
brightness of the asteroid at a given geometry, and therefore heavily
modify the modelled parameters from the remaining emitted IR ﬂux.
We analyse the near-IR Spitzer observations of (159402) 1999
AP10 in the 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm bands (Trilling et al. 2010), and cal-
culate the expected ﬂux contribution of reﬂected light. To derive the
reﬂected ﬂux components in each band, and their corresponding un-
certainties, we use: the phase curve parameters and uncertainties used
by the Spitzer team (Trilling et al. 2010), and the parameters derived
from our phase curve data with both the statistical phase curve ﬁt
uncertainties and the combined (statistical and aspect) uncertainties.
We also present the estimate of the reﬂected ﬂux component when
using an incorrect value for 𝐺, as an illustration of the signiﬁcant
eﬀect of changes in this parameter. These results are summarised in
Table 5.

If we were to use the derived shape model and assumed S-
type Hapke parameters to estimate the brightness at the geome-
try over which this asteroid was observed by Spitzer, we obtain
𝐹REF,3.6µm = 63 per cent and 𝐹REF,4.5µm = 12 per cent. However,
to get a proper prediction with this model we would need to derive
accurate Hapke parameters instead of using assumed values based on
the taxonomy of the asteroid. This is not typically feasible for near-
Earth asteroids, meaning phase curve estimates of the brightness are
usually needed. Using a signiﬁcantly incorrect value for 𝐺 can lead
to a conclusion that the reﬂected ﬂux component is larger than the
total ﬂux received at the detector, which can not be true. We must
therefore at least try to make an informed decision on the phase curve
parameters to use before doing this kind of modelling, rather than us-
ing one set of slope parameters across the entire asteroid population.
Using the Spitzer team values for the phase curve parameters (using
an assumed 𝐺 value), the estimate of the reﬂected ﬂux component is
signiﬁcantly higher in both bands than using the parameters derived
from our phase curve data. Ignoring the systematic eﬀects of as-
pect changes, we could think that we have constrained this reﬂected
ﬂux component very well. However, when we include the aspect
uncertainty in our Monte Carlo estimation we see that these values
are very poorly constrained. Ignoring the additional uncertainty that
may arise from aspect changes will therefore signiﬁcantly underes-
timate the uncertainty in the thermally-emitted component of the IR
ﬂux at the detector, and consequently underestimate the uncertainty
in any physical properties derived from thermophysical modelling
thereafter.

7 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have investigated the eﬀect of aspect changes on the
phase curves of near-Earth asteroids. We have presented an investi-
gation into the variability in the phase curve of near-Earth asteroid

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2022)

(159402) 1999 AP10. The light curves from the PIRATE facility
are combined with data from Palmer Divide Observatory obtained
from ALCDEF, in order to produce a convex shape model and pole
solution. The derived shape, pole, and sidereal rotation period match
expectations from independent data. This model is then used to ver-
ify that the deviations in the phase curve arise from aspect eﬀects
instead of random scatter in the data. This is achieved via simulation
of the phase curve over the apparition using the shape model and a
Hapke photometric model, which accurately recreates the variation
in the phase curve. The ﬂux-weighted mean latitude of visible and
illuminated facets on the shape model (the ‘ﬂux latitude’) changes
from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere through-
out the apparition. This change in observed hemisphere drives the
aspect-related eﬀects in the phase curve due to the diﬀerence in shape
between the two hemispheres of this asteroid. A large change in ﬂux
latitude may accompany large changes in light curve morphology,
so observed changes in the light curves used to construct a phase
curve may indicate the potential presence of aspect changes due to
changing ﬂux latitude. However, a lack of light curve morphological
changes does not necessarily mean a small change in ﬂux latitude or
observed cross-section, so care must still be taken to consider this
eﬀect.

After the detection of these aspect changes in the phase curve of
(159402) 1999 AP10, a theoretical study was undertaken in order
to understand how this eﬀect may aﬀect the phase curves of other
asteroids. Phase curves are simulated for a wide variety of ellipsoidal
shape models over diﬀerent viewing geometries, demonstrating some
of the worst-case scenarios that may arise. A representative sample of
asteroid models is simulated over the 2020 apparition of (19764) 2000
NF5, displaying the strong dependence of aspect related modulations
to the phase curve on the rotation pole orientation and change in ﬂux
latitude.

Aspect eﬀects introduce a systematic uncertainty in the 𝐻 and 𝐺
phase curve parameters ﬁt to the data. These additional uncertainties
are highly dependent on speciﬁc viewing geometry, so care must
be taken to model the potential impact of this eﬀect for each object
when using parameters derived from their phase curves in further
studies. Taxonomic classiﬁcation using phase curve data is deemed
unreliable from phase curves without supplemental data to support
the classiﬁcation. We provide a program for estimating the additional
uncertainty introduced into estimations of 𝐻 and 𝐺 when the shape
and pole of the object is unknown.

We have discussed the eﬀect of this additional aspect uncertainty
on wider studies of individual asteroids where convex inversion and
extraction of the surface scattering properties directly is not feasible.
This can propagate through to estimations of the diameter, aﬀecting
Yarkovsky and YORP eﬀect modelling. We have shown how the
additional aspect uncertainty in the phase curve parameters can aﬀect
derivations of asteroid properties such as the geometric albedo, and
also how this aﬀects our ability to properly separate reﬂected and
emitted ﬂuxes in observations of asteroids in the infrared transition
region.

This study has considered this eﬀect over a wide variety of convex
shapes. However, real asteroid shapes may have signiﬁcant concavi-
ties and the aspect eﬀects may be over or underestimated still by these
methods. The information from non-convex shapes is typically lost
when rotationally averaging for phase curves, however. It remains
the subject of future work to determine the signiﬁcance that large
concavities may have on this eﬀect.

Table 5. Estimates of the reﬂected ﬂux components of the detected infrared ﬂux for (159402) 1999 AP10. Evaluated for the Spitzer 3.6µm and 4.5µm bands
within the infrared transition region. First estimate uses the values assumed by the Spitzer team for the phase curve parameters. The second estimate uses the
phase curve parameters determined from phase curve observations with PIRATE, with statistical ﬁt uncertainties. The third estimate uses the combined aspect
and statistical ﬁt uncertainties for the phase curve parameters. The fourth estimate uses a wildly wrong value of G to signify the impact of picking arbitrary values
for the phase curve parameters. The choice of phase curve parameters to predict the V magnitude, and subsequently convert to an IR ﬂux is extremely important.
Using values from a measured phase curve can better constrain the percentage reﬂected ﬂux. However, once we include the potential aspect uncertainty in the
phase curve parameters it can be seen that this is not as well constrained as initially thought.
