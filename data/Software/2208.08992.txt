 Abstract 

An estimated 300,000 new cases of leukemia are diagnosed each year which is 2.8 percent 
of all new cancer cases and the prevalence is rising day by day. The most dangerous and 
deadly type of leukemia is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) which affects people of all 
age  groups  including  both  children  and  adults.  In  this  study,  we  propose  an  automated 
system  to  detect  various-shaped  ALL  blast  cells  from  microscopic  blood  smears  images 
using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The system can detect multiple subtypes of ALL cells 
with an accuracy of 98℅. Moreover, we have developed a telediagnosis software to provide 
real-time support to diagnose ALL subtypes from microscopic blood smears images.

Introduction 

1.1 Composition of Blood  

Blood  consists of several  elements.  The major components  of blood  include plasma, red 
blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Plasma is the major constituent of blood and 
comprises  about  55  percent  of  blood  volume.  It  consists  of  water  with  several  different 
substances  dissolved  within  [1].  Almost  45  percent  of  blood  includes  Red  Blood  Cells 
(RBC), White Blood Cells (WBC), and platelets. The RBC rate ranges from 4,000,000 to 
6,000,000  per  microliter  of  blood,  representing  40–45%  of  the  total  blood  volume  [2]. 
WBCs are the cells that defend against germs and give us immunity and resistance; they 
range from 4500 to 11,000 per microliter of blood [3]. The platelets range from 150,000 to 
450,000 per microliter of blood and are responsible for blood clotting [4]. Thus, an increase 
or decrease in any of the basic blood components will cause problems to a person’s health, 
such as leukemia, thalassemia, and anemia. 

1.2 Problem Statement 

Leukemia is one of the most dangerous types of malignancies affecting the bone marrow or 
blood in all age groups, both in children and adults. The most dangerous and deadly type of 
leukemia is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) 
is  a  cancer  of  the  blood  cells  that  are  characterized  by  a  large  number  of  immature 
lymphocytes, known as blast cells (myeloblasts) [5].  lymphocytes are classified into three 
types.  These  are  (I)  normal  lymphocytes,  (II)  atypical  lymphocytes,  and  (III)  reactive 
lymphocytes. Normal lymphocytes are characterized by homogeneity and round, small, and 
rough nuclei. Atypical cells, by a large size and nucleus and the fact that they have lumpy 
chromatins. Reactive cells, by their heterogeneity and the fact that they are surrounded by 
red  cells.  Microscopic  examination  is  the  method  of  diagnosing  lymphocyte  types.  It 
involves taking blood or bone marrow samples, which are diagnosed by a pathologist [6]. 
ALL is classified into three morphological types: (I) L1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, (II) 
L2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and (III) L3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [7]. There, L1 
cells  are  the  smallest,  with  a  uniform  population  and  coarse  chromatins.  L2  cells  have 
nuclear heterogeneity and are larger than L1 cells. L3 cells have vacuoles protruding into 
the cells and are larger than L1 cells [8]. About 90 % of patients can be cured, provided that 
the disease is diagnosed at an early stage by adopting mass screening procedures with an 
intelligent automated diagnosis system.  

1.3 Prevalence of Leukemia 

According  to  the  statistics  from  the  World  Health  Organization’s  (WHO)  International 
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the number of leukemia cases in both sexes of all 
age groups in 2018 was 4,37,033 and a total of 3,03,006 deaths [9]. Globally, the incidence 
rate  (per  1,00,000)  was  5.2  and  the  mortality  rate  (per  1,00,000)  was  3.5.  A  study  was 
conducted from January 2014 to December 2016 in the department of Pediatric Hematology 
and  oncology  of  Dhaka  Shishu  Hospital,  Bangladesh.  During  this  period  all  diagnosed 
children with ALL (12 months to 16 years) were included in the study who were selected to 

1 

 
give  chemotherapy.  Out  of  the  total  of  597  children,  327  (54.7%)  were  males  and  270 
(45.3%) were female. Parents of a total of 199 (3.33%) children refused to start therapy and 
the  rest  398  children  began  chemotherapy.  Among  the  total  children  who  started 
chemotherapy, 120 (20.10%) abandoned treatment in different phases of therapy. 66 (55%) 
abandoned  treatment  during  induction  of  remission.  23  (19.16%)  during  consolidation, 
12(10%)  re-induction, 
  and  19  (1585%)  children  during  maintenance  phases  of 
chemotherapy [10]. There the 199 patient's parents refused treatment because of the high 
cost  and  the  treatment  duration  was  very  lengthy  (about  10  years).  The  study  shows  the 
severity of ALL.  

1.4 Difficulties in Existing Manual Diagnosis 

The evaluation of bone marrow morphology and blood smear in an electronic microscope 
by  experienced  hematopathologists  is  essential  in  the  diagnosis  of  Acute  Lymphoblastic 
Leukemia  (ALL).    However,  it  suffers  from  a  lack  of  standardization  and  inter-observer 
variability. Because diagnosing Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a tedious task that 
is prone to human and machine errors. In several instances, it is difficult to make an accurate 
final  decision  even  after  careful  examination  by  an  experienced  pathologist.  Manual 
detection of ALL cells is conducted by pathologists and is typically subject to human error 
and  produces  inaccurate  results.  This  process  is  tedious,  time-consuming,  and  subject  to 
inter  and  intra-class  variations  among  pathologists.  Only  76.6%  of  the  cases  showed 
agreement between pathologists during leukemia diagnosis [11].  

1.5 Challenges in Automated Diagnosis using DNN 

The challenges in automated detection are associated with the complex nature of WBCs, 
including irregular boundaries and the textural similarities between WBCs and other blood 
components,  which  cause  difficulties  in  separating  blast  cells  (cancer  cells)  and  healthy 
cells.  [4]  Besides  The  Learnability  of  a  Deep  Learning  Model  strongly  depends  on  the 
effective and efficient data preparation pipeline. The accuracy and time complexity of ALL 
detection is strongly associated with the quality of the extracted features used in training the 
pixel-wise classification models.  

1.6 Proposed Approach 

In  this  thesis,  we  propose  to  develop  multiple  robust  Deep  Neural  Network  Models  for 
Medical  Image  Data  with  Acute  Lymphoblastic  Leukemia  (ALL)  cells,  with  enhanced 
learnability, predictability, and accuracy. Besides, we develop a Web Application to provide 
real-time support to  diagnose ALL cells. We have also  analyzed the performance of our 
proposed  method  with  multiple  related  works  to  assure  the  robustness  of  the  proposed 
model.  

1.7 Contributions of the Proposed Approach 

●  Subtype  classification  of  Acute  Lymphoblastic  Leukemia  with  almost  98% 

accuracy.  

●  Robust Deep Neural Network model for multiclass imbalanced data sets. 
●  Real-time telediagnosis support through the web application which has been built 

based on the proposed approach.

1.8 Organization of the Study 

We organize the study as follows. In Chapter 2 Literature Review, we briefly describe the 
related work’s methodology, outcomes, and limitations. In Chapter 3 Dataset Description, 
we elaborately discuss the data set and illustrate the image samples. After that in Chapter 4, 
the  proposed  method  is  detailed.  Chapter  5  Result  and  Discussion  elaborate  on  the 
performance of the models. Finally, In Chapter 6 we discussed the developed telediagnosis 
software. In the end we have concluded the research and mentioned the future works.

Literature Review 

Researchers applied various methods which incorporate Deep Learning (DL), Deep Neural 
Networks (DNN), and Medical Image Processing to detect leukemia cells from blood smear 
images and bone marrow images. 

Rohan et. al [5] developed an automation system to detect ALL blast cells in microscopic 
blood  smears  using  the  You  Only  Look  Once  (YOLO  v4)  algorithm.  They  trained  and 
evaluated their method using the ALL-IDB1 and C_NMC_2019 data sets. The ALL-IDB1 
dataset contained 108 images, which were collected in September 2005. The C_NMC_2019 
dataset contained 10,661 images collected from 73 subjects. The images in this dataset were 
single-celled and these were already pre-processed. In the preprocessing step they applied 
Auto  Orientation,  Resizing,  and  Augmentation  techniques.  The  preprocessing  steps 
generate  872  pre-process  images  after  augmentation  on  the  ALL-IDB1  dataset.  Finally 
achieved The mAP (Mean Average Precision) of 96.06 % for the ALL-IDB1 dataset and 
98.7 % for the C_NMC_2019 dataset. Where the loss was seen to reduce exponentially and 
reached an average of 0.57664 at the end of 6000 iterations on the ALL-IDB1 dataset and 
also the loss was seen to reduce exponentially and reached an average of 0.502 at the end of 
6000  iterations  on  the  C_NMC_2019  dataset.  But  no  complete  automated  screening  or 
diagnosing telehealth facility was established in this study.  

The authors in [8] proposed 3 distinct systems which were built based on ALL-IDB1 and 
ALL-IDB2. The first consists of the artificial neural network (ANN), feed-forward neural 
network  (FFNN),  and  support  vector  machine  (SVM),  all  of  which  are  based  on  hybrid 
features  extracted  using  Local  Binary  Pattern  (LBP),  Gray  Level  Co-occurrence  Matrix 
(GLCM) and Fuzzy Color Histogram (FCH) methods. The second proposed system consists 
of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models: AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet-18, 
based  on  the  transfer  learning  method,  in  which  deep  feature  maps  were  extracted  and 
classified.  The  third  proposed  system  consists  of  hybrid  CNN–SVM  technologies, 
consisting of two blocks: CNN models for extracting feature maps and the SVM algorithm 
for classifying feature maps. In the first system, ANN and FFNN reached an accuracy of 
100%, while SVM reached an accuracy of 98.11%. In the second proposed system, all the 
transfer  learning  models  have  achieved  100%  accuracy  and  in  the  last  proposed  system  
AlexNet + SVM achieved 100% accuracy, Goog-LeNet + SVM achieved 98.1% accuracy, 
and ResNet-18 + SVM achieved 100% accuracy. Although the feature extraction methods 
are well enough, the data preparation pipeline is not generalized and effective because of 
the single Denoising technique (average and Laplacian filters) in the pre-processing step. 
Where the robustness of the model comes into question.  

A multi-step DL approach was performed in [12] to automatically segment Leukemia cells 
from  bone  marrow  images.  The  authors  analyzed  1251  patients  who  have  been  newly 
diagnosed and treated with AML and 236 Healthy Cohort. Then build the model using 5204 
augmented AML bone marrow smear images and 5428 augmented control bone marrow 
smear images. The multi-step includes the following workflow. First, initial segmentation 
was  done  with  the  VGG  Image  Annotator  tool.  Then,  the  FRCNN  was  trained  with  the 
segmented images and created new segmentation proposals for unsegmented images which 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
were  manually  corrected  by  hematologists.  Step  2:  Feature  extraction  was  performed 
manually by hematologists.  Step 3: For the distinction between AML and healthy control 
samples  based  on  segmented  images,  the  authors  trained  a  multitude  of  DL  models  for 
binary predictions. In step 4: For NPM1 status prediction, transfer learning with a ResNet50  
pre-trained on ImageNet was utilized on BMS images. Finally, the FRCNN achieved a cell 
segmentation accuracy of 0.97 from BMS. The binary classification model showed an AUC 
of 0.97 for both the ROC and the precision-recall curve and a micro-average accuracy of 
0.91  distinguishing  between  AML  and  healthy  bone  marrow  donor  samples.  For  NPM1 
prediction their DL model achieved a high accuracy of 0.86 in predicting mutation status. 
Although the study has a good outcome, the manual feature extraction technique may lead 
to inefficiency and error with the large dataset.  

The  AML_Cytomorphology_LMU  dataset  consisted  of  18,365  expert-labeled  single-cell 
images obtained from  peripheral  blood  smears of 100 AML patients  and  100 controls  at 
Munich  University  Hospital  between  2014  and  2017  used  by  the  study  [13].  The  author 
proposed a new hybrid feature extraction method using image processing and deep learning 
methods.  The  proposed  method  consists  of  two  steps:  1)  a  region  of  interest  (ROI)  is 
extracted  using  the  CMYK-moment  localization  method  and  2)  deep  learning-based 
features  are  extracted  using  a  CNN-based  feature  fusion  method.  The  method  obtained 
overall classification accuracies of 97.57%. There the image data preparation pipeline is not 
generalized which can lead to a mass accuracy fall in terms of new image data.  

Authors developed a method in [26] to detect ALL using transfer learning and later validate 
the model using XAI. As the dataset was imbalanced with the more ALL class, the class 
weight method was used to balance the weights of the two classes in preprocessing  For the 
used dataset, the class weight of normal cells was 1.57288, and the class weight of acute 
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cells was 0.73301. Then, different pre-trained models, namely 
InceptionV3,  ResNet101V2,  VGG19,  and  InceptionResNetV2,  were  used  to  train  the 
model. All the images were reduced to 299px * 299px because the Inception V3 input shape 
must be (299, 299, 3) and a standard batch size of 32 is used while training. A segmentation 
method was employed to divide the example image into separate sections to see if the model 
could  accurately  read  it.  ResNet101v2  model  Accuracy  is  0.9861,  Loss  is  0.0333  and 
validation accuracy is 0.9589, Validation loss is 0.1559 F1 score 0.9861, and Validation F1 
score 0.9588.

collected 1,732 bone marrow images containing 27,184 cells (including 24,165 cells and 
2,983 cell debris) from 89 children with leukemia from the Shanghai Children’s Medical 
Center. We randomly separated 70% of the cells in the training set, and the remaining cells 
were used to form the validation set and test set.

In this study [28] 4,451 real images of bone marrow cells on the Hyde star HDS-BFS high-
speed micro scanning image system were collected, with a resolution of 4,000×3,000. The 
object  detection  model  is  based  on  the  Faster  RegionConvolutional  Neural  Network  (R-
CNN). Faster R-CNN is composed of the region proposal network (RPN) and Fast R-CNN, 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
in which RPN is used to select candidate target boxes and Fast R-CNN is used for accurate 
target  classification  and  regression.  Compared  to  the  baseline,  although  their  method 
resulted in a slight drop in recall (~4%), it improved the precision by 26.4%, the F1-score 
by 12.1%, and the AP@50 by 3%. The model achieves a recall of 0.710, precision of 0.496, 
AP@50 of 0.533, and F1-score of 0.575. They developed a new morphological diagnosis 
system for bone marrow cells. The model is based on the Faster R-CNN. 

The  study  [29]  focuses  on  the  C-NMC-2019  dataset  and  the  application  of  DL  and  the 
ensemble  strategy.  In  their  proposed  model,  the  Hem  class  was  over-sampled  to  5822 
images,  and  a  total  of  11644  images  were  trained  during  the  training  process.  In  this 
circumstance, 
networks,  VGG-16,  Xception,  MobileNetV2, 
InceptionResNet-V2, and DenseNet-121, are adopted for transfer learning applications. The 
image is transferred through a stack of convolutional layers, where the filters are used with 
tiny receptive filters (3 × 3). The Kappa-based ensemble model has produced the best ALL 
recognition results, with 89.72% WFS and 94.8% AUC.

The authors in [31], applied feature extraction using PCA 2 to reduce dimensionality in a 
heart  disease  dataset.  There  the  proposed  method  integrates  the  K-means  Clustering  and 
Genetic Algorithm and finally achieved 94.06% of clustering accuracy. In [32], the authors 
proposed  a  novel  feature  selection  algorithm  in  a  chronic  kidney  disease  dataset  that 
aggregated  wrapper,  filter,  and  ensemble  methods  and  achieved  100%  accuracy  in

Dataset Description 

We have used the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Image dataset. The images of this 
dataset  [24]  [25]  were  prepared  in  the  Bone  Marrow  Laboratory  of  Taleqani  Hospital 
(Tehran, Iran). This dataset consisted of 3256 peripheral blood smear (PBS) images from 
89 patients suspected of ALL, whose blood samples were prepared and stained by skillful 
laboratory staff, including 25 healthy individuals with a benign diagnosis (hematogone) and 
64  patients  with  a  definitive  diagnosis  of  ALL  subtypes,  Early  Pre-B,  Pre-B,  and  Pro-B 
ALL. This dataset is divided into two classes benign and malignant. The former comprises 
hematogenous  and  the  latter  is  the  ALL  group  with  three  subtypes  of  malignant 
lymphoblasts: Early Pre-B, Pre-B, and Pro-B ALL. All the images were taken by using a 
Zeiss camera in a microscope with a 100x magnification and saved as JPG files. A specialist 
using the flow cytometry tool made the definitive determination of the types and subtypes 
of these cells. After color thresholding-based segmentation in the HSV color space, dataset 
collectors also provide segmented images. Figure 3.1.1 - 3.1.4 depicts the images of Benign 
(hematogone)  Cells,  Early  Pre-B  ALL  Cells,  Pre-B  ALL  Cells,  and    Pro-B  ALL  Cells 
respectively.

We have used the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Dataset to train and validate our 
DNN model. It is a multiclass dataset that contains a benign cell and 3 subtypes of blast 
cells named Early Pre-B, Pre-B, and Pro-B. A DNN model trained with ALL datasets may 
aid in detecting the subtypes of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia by classifying all types of 
subtypes.

Proposed Method 

4.1 Overview 

We have selected the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) public datasets to build our 
Deep Neural Network models. Figure 4.1.1 illustrates the workflow of the proposed method.   

Fig. 4.1.1 Workflow of the proposed method 

In the beginning, we called the Kaggle API to fetch the dataset. Then we split the dataset 
into Training, Validation, and Testing Set to avoid data leakage and overfitting. Then we 
preprocessed the Training Set using our Data Preprocessing Pipeline. Then we have only 
normalized  the  Validation  and  Testing  Set’s  images.  It  will  keep  the  Global  and  Local 
Minima-Maxima different, which is another essential procedure to avoid data leakage and 
overfitting. Then the Training and Validation images have passed to the DNN architectures. 
Now,  Multiple  DNN  Algorithms  have  been  trained  and  validated  from  the  Training  and 
Validation Set. The best-fitted models depending on validation accuracy at this stage have 
been selected as optimized models. Now the normalized Test images have been tested with 
the Multiple Optimized DNN Models. Finally, the images in the Test set will be classified 
into  Benign,  Early  Pre-B,  Pre-B,  and  Pro-B  to  detect  various  subtypes  of  acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia cells.  

4.2 Data Preparation Pipeline 

The  performance  of  a  DNN  depends  largely  on  suitable  data  preparation.  Our  data 
preparation  pipeline  contains  the  following  techniques  to  pre-process  the  microscopic 
images for ALL detection.  

●  Resizing (224px width, 224px height, 3 channels) 
●  Padding 
●  Augmentation 
●  Normalization 

There the Augmentation technique contains the following techniques.

Telediagnosis Software Based on the Proposed Method 

6.1 Telediagnosis Service of the WebApp 

We have developed a  Realtime Tele Diagnosis Web App to aid in the detection of ALL 
subtypes.  Fig  6.1.1  illustrates  the  architecture  of  the  Telediagnosis  software.  The  App 
collects ALL Images from the user-end (Frontend) and passes the image data to the server-
end (Backend). The server processes the images and calls the best DNN model. Finally, the 
model  predicts  the  subtype  of  the  ALL  and  passes  the  result  to  the  user-end.  Fig  6.1.2 
illustrates the home page of the Web Application and fig 6.1.3 illustrates how the diagnosis 
result is shown to the user-end.

Conclusion 
A lot of people are losing lives because of the severity of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
and the number is increasing day by day. The patients who survive lose their vitality. The 
current Artificial Intelligence-based automated systems are also facing challenges due to the 
various  shape,  patterns,  and  textures  of  ALL  blast  cells.  We  have  developed  optimized 
Multi-DNN  models  and  a  telediagnosis  web  application,  which  will  fight  against  the 
severity of ALL by providing efficient diagnosis assistance. 

Future Work 
According  to  our  research  many  researchers  have  applied  DNN  to  detect  Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukemia but a thorough method and generalized model are still missing. 
In  the  future,  we  would  like  to  develop  a  robust  method,  which  will  be  able  to  perform 
segmentation, ROI detection, estimated blast cell calculation, and generalized classification.
