ABSTRACT

A large fraction of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations over the next decade will be in the near-
infrared (NIR), at wavelengths beyond the reach of the current standard light-curve model for SN Ia
cosmology, SALT3 (∼ 2800–8700 Å central ﬁlter wavelength). To harness this new SN Ia sample and
reduce future light-curve standardization systematic uncertainties, we train SALT3 at NIR wavelengths
(SALT3-NIR) up to 2 µm with the open-source model-training software SALTshaker, which can easily
accommodate future observations. Using simulated data we show that the training process constrains
the NIR model to ∼ 2–3% across the phase range (−20 to 50 days). We ﬁnd that Hubble residual (HR)
scatter is smaller using the NIR alone or optical+NIR compared to optical alone, by up to ∼ 30%
depending on ﬁlter choice (95% conﬁdence). There is signiﬁcant correlation between NIR light-curve
stretch measurements and luminosity, with stretch and color corrections often improving HR scatter by
up to ∼ 20%. For SN Ia observations expected from the Roman Space Telescope, SALT3-NIR increases
the amount of usable data in the SALT framework by ∼ 20% at redshift z (cid:46) 0.4 and by ∼ 50% at
z (cid:46) 0.15. The SALT3-NIR model is part of the open-source SNCosmo and SNANA SN Ia cosmology
packages.

1. INTRODUCTION
Future time-domain surveys will discover samples of
tens to hundreds of thousands of Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia), which will be used to measure cosmological
parameters such as the Hubble-Lemaître constant (H0)
and the dark energy equation of state (EoS; e.g., Gar-
navich et al. 1998; Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al.
1999; Scolnic et al. 2018; Brout et al. 2022). For cos-
mological measurements, SN Ia samples require precise
photometric (and often spectroscopic) observations with
a relatively high cadence over a series of weeks, and a
well-trained model describing the spectral evolution of
SNe Ia over time. This model is used for brightness stan-
dardization and subsequent luminosity-distance mea-
surements, typically by applying corrections to an ob-
served SN Ia brightness based upon the ﬁtted light-curve
shape (here called “stretch") and color (e.g., the Tripp
equation; Tripp 1998). Historically, most SN Ia observa-
tions have been at optical wavelengths (∼ 3000–8000 Å;
e.g., Hamuy et al. 1996; Riess et al. 1999; Astier et al.
2006; Jha et al. 2006, 2007; Holtzman et al. 2008; Hicken
et al. 2009; Contreras et al. 2010; Stritzinger et al. 2011;
Hicken et al. 2012; Jones et al. 2017; Foley et al. 2018;
Abbott et al. 2019), which has led to models of SN Ia
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with similar wave-
length coverage (e.g., Guy et al. 2005, 2007, 2010; Be-
toule et al. 2014; Mosher et al. 2014; Saunders et al.
2018; Leget et al. 2020; Taylor et al. 2021).

There are indications that the remaining scatter in
residuals in a Hubble diagram made with optical dis-
tance measurements (“intrinsic scatter”; e.g., Scolnic
et al. 2018) can be reduced by up to ∼ 60% using
rest-frame near-infrared (NIR) SN Ia observations (Elias
et al. 1986; Krisciunas et al. 2004a; Mandel et al. 2011;
Dhawan et al. 2018; Avelino et al. 2019). Such an im-
provement would require a large sample of rest-frame
NIR SN Ia spectra and photometry, and a well-trained
model with coverage at these wavelengths to be used for
brightness standardization. While there have been SN Ia
light-curve models trained at NIR wavelengths (e.g.,
Burns et al. 2011, 2014; Mandel et al. 2011, 2020), most
large-sample cosmological analyses including SNe Ia for
the last decade (Guy et al. 2010; Conley et al. 2011;
Betoule et al. 2014; Riess et al. 2018; Sako et al. 2018;
Scolnic et al. 2018; Brout et al. 2019; Jones et al. 2019;
Brout et al. 2022) have used the SALT2 framework
for brightness standardization (Guy et al. 2007, 2010).
SALT2 is a principal component analysis (PCA)-like
SED time-series model with continuous wavelength cov-
erage (2000–9200 Å), and it is trained on a mix of spec-
tra and photometry from SNe Ia over a wide range in
redshift z, light-curve stretch, and color. This model is

well understood and thoroughly vetted, covers a rela-
tively large phase range, spans slightly beyond optical
wavelengths, obviates the need for K-corrections, and
has a diverse, open-source training sample. If reliably
extended to the NIR, SALT can continue providing a
robust open-source model for the future of SN Ia light-
curve ﬁtting.

The next decade of SN Ia surveys from space, which in
particular includes the Nancy Grace Roman Space Tele-
scope (hereafter Roman), will observe primarily at NIR
wavelengths. The natural choice of model to harness
this new wealth of data is SALT owing to its consistent
use in cosmological analyses (for a summary of other
reasons, see Kenworthy et al. 2021, hereafter K21). Al-
though SALT2 has already been extended to NIR wave-
lengths for simulation studies (Pierel et al. 2018, here-
after P18), the resulting model was not fully trained
or validated and is insuﬃcient for cosmological analy-
ses using real data. The SALT3 model from K21 has
an improved and open-source training code and sam-
ple compared with SALT2, and its wavelength cover-
age in the red extended from 0.92 µm to 1.1 µm (central
ﬁlter wavelength 8700 Å). However, most low-redshift
(z (cid:46) 0.15) SN Ia observations expected from Roman are
beyond the red end of the SALT3 wavelength range and
will not currently be used for distance measurements.
If this gap is not addressed with a redder rest-frame
model, it will be necessary to observe a low-z sample
of SNe Ia at optical wavelengths from the ground (e.g.,
Foley et al. 2018), and combine these with a sample of
higher-z SNe Ia whose NIR observations will be probing
rest-frame optical wavelengths.

To include the full range of observations expected from
Roman in the robust SALT framework, and to enable
future cosmological inference at NIR wavelengths, a new
version of the model is needed. To address this need, we
perform the ﬁrst robust training of the SALT3 model to
2 µm using 166 SNe Ia with rest-frame NIR observations,
producing a model that we label as “SALT3-NIR.” While
the data volume and calibration are not yet of the same
quality as optical data, this training sample will be con-
tinuously improved in the future and the model kept up-
to-date with the open-source SALTshaker1 framework.
This work enables Roman SN Ia data to be utilized as
they become available instead of waiting until there is
a suﬃcient SN Ia sample to train a Roman-only SALT
model in the NIR, and produces an improved model for
accurate simulations or ﬁtting of early Roman obser-
vations. The full training sample used here, as well

law” component controlling the eﬀects of intrinsic color
variation and dust, CL(λ). M0 and M1 are deﬁned as
ﬂux surfaces using an interpolated grid in phase and
wavelength space that is deﬁned by the training pro-
cess, while CL is deﬁned as a polynomial (Figure 1).
The remaining terms in Equation 1 are the free param-
eters used to ﬁt SN Ia light-curve data. The parameter
x0 is the overall ﬂux normalization, x1 is the contri-
bution of the M1 correction term and is a measure of
SN Ia light-curve shape or “stretch,” and c is a measure
of SN Ia “color.” These three parameters are used as part
of the Tripp (1998) equation to measure the luminosity
distance to each SN Ia (e.g., Scolnic et al. 2018).

2.1. SALT Distance Determinations
Accurately measuring SN Ia luminosity distances in
the SALT framework is a two-step process. First, best-
ﬁt parameters from Equation 1 (x0, x1, c) are measured
for a given light curve. These parameters are used to
correct the measured apparent magnitude and infer a
luminosity distance using the Tripp (1998) equation,

µ = −2.5 log10(x0) + αx1 − βc − M0 ,
where α (β) is the coeﬃcient between luminosity and
stretch (color), and M0 is the SN Ia absolute magni-

parameters are determined by the SALT2mu method de-
scribed by Marriner et al. (2011). SALT2mu determines
the distance moduli separately from the cosmology ﬁt
by minimizing the Hubble residuals in redshift bins.
This cosmology-independent method allows us to di-
rectly compare distances measured by diﬀerent SALT
models without considering the impact of diﬀerent cos-
mological assumptions. When comparing SALT3 and
SALT3-NIR derived distances in Section 5, we are only
concerned with relative diﬀerences between the models,
and therefore we ignore corrections for host-galaxy mass
(e.g., Hamuy et al. 1996; Ivanov et al. 2000; Kelly et al.
2010; Sullivan et al. 2010) and selection bias (Kessler &
Scolnic 2017). These additional corrections are required
to measure cosmological parameters (e.g., Scolnic et al.
2018), but are not needed to compare Hubble residuals
with diﬀerent light-curve models.

2.2. SALT2-Extended
While the SALT models have been used for optical
cosmological measurements over the last ∼ 15 yr, there
has been only one attempt to extend SALT to NIR
wavelengths. P18 used the template from Hsiao et al.
(2007), warped to photometry from the Carnegie Su-
pernova Project (CSP), to approximately extend the
SALT2 model for use in simulations in advance of fu-
ture NIR surveys (e.g., Hounsell et al. 2018; Rose et al.

isting SALT3 model at peak (p = 0) brightness (black solid).
The M0 component (red dotted) deﬁnes a “baseline” SN Ia

stretch of a given SN, and the color-law (blue dash-dot) is

parameters.

as the resulting model, will be made public once this
manuscript is published.

We begin with a discussion of the SALT3 formalism in
Section 2, followed by a description of the NIR training
dataset in Section 3 that is used to perform the model
training in Section 4 and validation in Section 5. Sec-
tion 5 also contains an analysis of improvements for NIR
cosmology relative to existing models. We conclude in
Section 6.

2. THE SALT3 MODEL
Here we brieﬂy review the formalism of the SALT3
model; for more details, see K21. SALT3 is based upon
the original SALT framework (Guy et al. 2005, 2007),
which gives the spectral ﬂux (F ) as a function of rest-
frame phase (p) and wavelength (λ):

F (p, λ) =x0 [M0(p, λ) + x1M1(p, λ)]
· exp (c · CL(λ)) .

(1)

The model is described by three components characteriz-
ing the population of SNe as determined in the training
process, and three parameters characterizing each ob-
ject in individual light-curve ﬁts. The ﬁrst two compo-
nents are M0(p, λ), which represents a “standard” SN Ia,
and M1(p, λ), which contributes a ﬁrst-order linear cor-
rection to the baseline ﬂux. Finally, there is a “color

2021). The model (here “SALT2-Extended”), which is
not trained on spectra nor a procedure to train possi-
ble relationships between the NIR and light-curve pa-
rameters x1 or c, is not suitable for SN Ia cosmologi-
cal parameter measurements in the NIR. Still, SALT2-
Extended serves as a useful baseline for what the com-
ponents of SALT3 may look like in the NIR, and pro-
vides the only data-driven means of simulating NIR pho-
tometry with an independent (but similarly conceived)
model of SN Ia SED evolution. We therefore make use of
SALT2-Extended in simulations for validation purposes
in Section 5.

3. SALT3-NIR TRAINING SAMPLE
We review the K21 compilation of training data in
Section 3.1, which was used to train the SALT3 model
to ∼ 1.1 µm. We build upon this sample by adding a
compilation of NIR photometry and spectra presented
in Section 3.2. The NIR compilation includes public
data (Section 3.2.1), and a series of new SNe Ia observed
in the NIR (Sections 3.2.2- 3.2.4). Using this sample of
photometric and spectroscopic data, we train the SALT3
model to a maximum wavelength of 2 µm in Section 4,
resulting in the SALT3-NIR model. The full training
sample described here will be released publicly alongside
the ﬁnal model.

3.1. K21 Sample
In K21, the most recent SALT2 training sample from
Betoule et al. (2014, the “Joint Light Curve Analysis,”
JLA) was augmented with light curves of an additional
∼ 700 SNe Ia from a combination of the second data
release of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP; Con-
treras et al. 2010; Stritzinger et al. 2011; Krisciunas et al.
2017), the fourth data release from the Center for As-
trophysics SN Ia program (CfA4; Hicken et al. 2012), as
well as the Foundation Supernova Survey (Foley et al.
2018; Dettman et al. 2021), the Pan-STARRS Medium
Deep Survey (PS1 MDS; Jones et al. 2017; Villar et al.
2020; Hosseinzadeh et al. 2020), and the Dark Energy
Survey (DES; The Dark Energy Survey Collaboration
2005; Abbott et al. 2019; Brout et al. 2019).

The spectroscopic sample was bolstered by spectra
from the KAEPORA database (Siebert et al. 2019), the
majority of which originate from the Berkeley SN Ia Pro-
gram (BSNIP; Silverman et al. 2012; Stahl et al. 2020).
Light-curve quality cuts were applied to the K21 sam-
ple requiring (in the rest frame, relative to B-band time
of maximum light) at least four photometric measure-
ments within −10 to +35 days, at least one measure-
ment between +5 and +20 days, measurements in two
ﬁlters between −8 and +20 days, and at least one mea-
surement within −10 to −1 days. All photometric data

zero-points and ﬁlter wavelength shifts were recalibrated
using the “Supercal” cross-calibration methodology of
Scolnic et al. (2015), which used the 3π sky coverage of
the PS1 photometric system to determine precise oﬀsets
between PS1 (which has been measured to < 10 mmag
precision) and other photometric systems.

After all cuts have been applied, the compilation of
training data includes 1083 SNe Ia, each with a well-
sampled light curve, and 1207 spectra from 380 SNe Ia.
We show the density of photometric and spectroscopic
data included in this compilation of optical training data
in Figure 2. See K21 for a full description of the compo-
sition of the sample, as well as characteristics including
distributions of redshift, stretch, and color. The only
additions to the K21 sample when training the optical
portion of SALT3-NIR are the optical companion light
curves of new SNe Ia with NIR observations (see next
section) and updates to the photometric calibration de-
scribed by Brout et al. (2021). This eﬀort utilized the
public Pan-STARRS stellar photometry catalog (Currie
et al. 2020) to cross-calibrate against tertiary standards
released by individual SN Ia surveys, and the resulting
improvements have already been applied to the SALT3
model released by K21.2

3.2. Near-Infrared Sample
We have compiled a large sample of SNe Ia with pub-
licly available data in the rest-frame NIR, which come
primarily from the CfA and CSP surveys but also other
SNe Ia reported in the literature (Section 3.2.1). Ad-
ditionally, we have made use of the Hubble Space Tele-
scope (HST ) observations produced as part of multi-
ple HST programs designed to bolster space-based NIR
SN Ia data (Sections 3.2.2-3.2.3), and a large sample of
new ground-based NIR light curves described in Section
3.2.4. This work does not produce any updated pho-
tometry or spectra, but instead relies upon previous or
ongoing eﬀorts to build a NIR SN Ia sample. Accord-
ingly, we have assumed accurate calibration for all the
data used here, a caveat discussed more in Section 6.
Characteristics of the ﬁnal training sample are detailed
in Section 3.2.5.

3.2.1. Public Data

The compilation of public NIR data includes 107 SNe,
each with an optical+NIR light curve (CfA: Wood-Vasey
et al. 2008; Hicken et al. 2009; Hicken et al. 2012, Fried-
man et al. 2015; Marion et al. 2016; CSP: Contreras
et al. 2010; Stritzinger et al. 2010; Stritzinger et al.

range of 0.0024 < z < 0.07. The design and imple-
mentation of the SIRAH program is described by Jha
et al. (in prep.), and the HST observations (and details
of the surveys, photometry, and spectra) are presented
by Pierel et al.
(in prep.). From SIRAH, we include
485 photometric observations in 5 WFC3/IR ﬁlters, and
36 contemporaneous NIR spectra from the WFC3/IR
grism (∼ 8000–17,000 Å) and Keck NIRES (∼ 10, 000–
25,000 Å) instruments. Ground-based optical observa-
tions of the SIRAH SNe Ia, which come from the As-
teroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS;
Tonry et al. 2018) and the Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF; Masci et al. 2019), are also included in the sam-
ple to accurately measure the time of peak brightness,
light-curve stretch, and color.

3.2.3. RAISIN
The RAISIN4 program (Jones et al. 2022) was an HST
program carried out during Cycles 20 and 235. The
goal of RAISIN was to observe a statistically signiﬁcant
sample of cosmologically useful, z > 0.1 SNe Ia in the
rest-frame NIR to measure the dark energy equation-of-
state parameter, w = P/(ρc2).

RAISIN followed 46 total SNe Ia from the PS1 MDS
and the DES SN surveys, 37 of which were used to mea-
sure w. 18 SNe include three NIR epochs of data in both
the F 125W and F 160W ﬁlters, while the remaining SNe
include approximately three NIR epochs of data in only
the F 160W ﬁlter. Details of the surveys and methods
for deriving photometry are given by Jones et al. (2022).
Here, as with SIRAH, we include the ground-based op-
tical and HST NIR data for those 37 SNe in our training
sample.

3.2.4. DEHVILS
The DEHVILS survey (Dark Energy, H0, and pecu-
liar Velocities using Infrared Light from Supernovae) is
a SN Ia follow-up survey on the UKIRT telescope on the
summit of Maunakea, Hawai‘i (Peterson et al., in prep.).
The survey began in March 2020, and has observed more
than 100 z < 0.1 SNe Ia in the Y JH ﬁlters with a me-
dian of ∼ 5 epochs of observation per SN. SN targets
are selected primarily from ATLAS (Tonry et al. 2018)
transient discoveries, and SIRAH targets within an ac-
cessible declination range were also prioritized. Light
curves are generated using photpipe (Rest et al. 2005),
with photometric calibration tied to 2MASS (Skrutskie
et al. 2006) using the color transformations derived by
Hodgkin et al. (2009). DEHVILS also observed several

2007; Valentini et al. 2003; Stanishev et al. 2007; Pig-
nata et al. 2008; Leloudas et al. 2009). This sample
includes 15 NIR spectra of 12 SNe, with large gaps of
coverage in rest-frame phase relative to peak that are
supplemented in the following sections.

3.2.2. SIRAH
SIRAH3 was a 2 yr HST program (2020–2021) that
concluded in Cycle 28, having observed a new sample of
SNe Ia in the Hubble ﬂow (0.02 (cid:46) z (cid:46) 0.07) in the NIR
with both HST photometry and slitless spectroscopy.
The ﬁnal sample consists of 26 SNe Ia from a redshift

Milky Way Cepheids in its ﬁrst year, and those obser-
vations are published by Konchady et al. (2022). The
ﬁrst-year SN Ia sample will be described by Peterson
et al.
(in prep.). For the purposes of being included
in this training sample, we once again add the optical
data available for each DEHVILS SN Ia, which primarily
come from ATLAS.

3.2.5. Full Compilation
Characteristics of the full NIR training sample are
listed in Table 1, which describes only the SNe Ia with
NIR data. The overall coverage in phase and wavelength
space can be seen in Figure 4. In total, we have made
use of 166 SNe Ia with NIR data to train SALT3-NIR.
Each of these SNe has a well-sampled optical light curve,
which is used to constrain the time of maximum light,
light-curve stretch, and color (Figure 3). We have ap-
plied no additional optical cuts on the training sam-
ple, beyond those described by K21 and outlined in Sec-
tion 3.1. For the NIR, we require at least two epochs
of photometry in at least one NIR ﬁlter (i.e., Y JH)
within the rest-frame phase range of SALT3-NIR (−20
to 50 days). The additional photometric data coverage
from the SNe Ia in Sections 3.2.2–3.2.4 is shown in Fig-
ure 5, and an example of the added NIR spectra is shown
in Section 5.1.

4. CREATING SALT3-NIR WITH SALTshaker
In an eﬀort to standardize the methodology of train-
ing and validating SALT spectrophotometric models,
Kenworthy et al. (2021) presented the SALTshaker soft-
ware program. SALTshaker is a ﬂexible and open-source
training and validation pipeline written in Python,
which we use here to train the new SALT3-NIR model
that extends into the rest-frame NIR. SALTshaker en-
ables the astronomy community to retrain future itera-
tions of SALT3-NIR.

Here we use the same SALTshaker implementation as
in K21, with minor changes to accommodate the NIR
(see following section). Brieﬂy, the general training pro-
cedure builds an empirical SALT3-NIR model by using
photometric and spectroscopic data from a SN sample
to ﬁt the model parameters with the following methods
(see Section 2 of K21).

• The M0 and M1 principal components are con-
structed using a second-order B-spline basis, where
the values of the knots are determined by ﬁtting
the data.

• The SALT3-NIR color law is determined by ﬁtting
a fourth-order polynomial with a linear extension.

bottom) for the K21 sample (red dashed line) and the added
NIR sample (black).

• The SN Ia parameters x0, x1, and c are ﬁt simul-

taneously with the model parameters.

• The SN Ia spectra are recalibrated by using a poly-
nomial (as a function of wavelength) that warps
each spectrum to match the SED model. This
spectral warping allows the training procedure to
account for systematic shifts in the spectral cali-
bration.

• The SALT3-NIR error model is constructed using
a zeroth-order B-spline basis, equivalent to binning
the data in phase and wavelength.

• The SALT3-NIR color dispersion model uses
a single sixth-order polynomial to model the
wavelength-dependent scatter simultaneously in
each independent ﬁlter.

SALTshaker uses an iterative Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm to minimize the χ2 between the model, con-
structed using the methods above, and the data, while

estimating the free parameters of the model. The χ2 in-
cludes contributions from the SN photometry and spec-
tra, with additional “regularization" terms that penal-
ize the χ2 for high-frequency M0 and M1 variations as
a function of phase and wavelength, and which ensures
the model is separable in phase and wavelength (see K21,
Equation 11).

A number of model deﬁnitions are used to avoid de-
generacies between the model components (M0, M1, CL)
and model parameters (x0, x1, c). An example of such a
degeneracy is an increase in the value of x0 and simul-
taneous decrease in the amplitudes of (M0, M1), which
would leave the overall model ﬂux unchanged. We add
priors that ﬁx the peak B-band magnitude to an ar-
bitrary value to avoid an M0–x0 degeneracy, and that
force (µx1, σx1) = (0, 1) to avoid an M1–x1 degeneracy.
Another prior forces the ﬁnal c parameter distribution of
the training sample to be 0 (µc = 0), and we anchor the
value of the color law at the central wavelengths of the
Bessell B and V bands to avoid degeneracies between c
and the color law. A ﬁnal prior reduces the correlation
between the x1 and c distributions, to avoid confusion
of color diﬀerences with the M1 component. Each of
these priors, as well as more details of their purpose, is
described in Section 2.1 of K21.

The SALTshaker procedure alternates between ﬁtting
the model parameters and ﬁtting the error model, where
error-model determination is performed by maximiz-
ing the log-likelihood with iMinuit6, until the ﬁtting

converges. Further details of the SALTshaker training
process are given by K21, with their Figure 2 giving
an overview schematic of the training procedure. All
SALT3 comparisons in Section 5 use this model train-
ing process, with the updated calibration discussed at
the end of Section 3.17.

4.1. SALTshaker in the NIR
Extending the wavelength range of SALT3 requires
some adjustments to the SALTshaker parameters used
by K21. We ﬁrst extend the M0 and M1 wavelength
ranges to a maximum of 20,000 Å to fully encompass
the red edge of all photometric ﬁlters and spectra in our
sample. Next, while K21 ﬁt the color law polynomial
up to 8000 Å and allowed only linear variation in the
range 8000–11,000 Å, we use the additional constraining
power of NIR data to ﬁt the color-law polynomial up
to 12,500 Å. This corresponds to roughly the central J-
band ﬁlter wavelength, and we similarly allow only linear
variation in the range 12,500–20,000 Å.

4.2. SALT3-NIR
We train SALT3-NIR using SALTshaker in the man-
ner described in the preceding sections, and with the
full training sample from Section 3.2.5. Features of the
resulting model are shown in Figures 6–8. In particu-
lar, Figure 6 compares SALT3-NIR to SALT2-Extended
(Section 2.2). Signiﬁcant diﬀerences are obvious in the
smoothness of the model M1 component (no regular-
ization was attempted for SALT2-Extended), and while

ure 8 compares the SALT3 and SALT3-NIR color law
and color scatter, which describes an intrinsic variance
of the SN Ia population unexplained by the model, with
signiﬁcant advancements in the NIR. As we still train
the optical portion of the model simultaneously with the
NIR, there are diﬀerences at bluer wavelengths between
SALT3 and SALT3-NIR; these are discussed in Section
6.

5. VALIDATING SALT3-NIR
5.1. Producing Simulated Training Samples
To validate the training procedure, we simulate sam-
ples of light curves and spectra with observational char-
acteristics [i.e., cadence, signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), and
ﬁlter/wavelength coverage] matching the training sam-
ple described in Section 4. We employ the widely used
simulation in the SuperNova ANAlyis (SNANA) software
package (Kessler et al. 2009), which generates realiza-
tions of SN photometry following Figure 1 of Kessler
et al. (2019). Brieﬂy, the simulation begins with a
rest-frame “Source SED" and propagates the SN light
through an expanding universe, the Milky Way, Earth’s
atmosphere, and instrumental ﬁlters, ﬁnally generating
CCD photoelectrons. To produce realistic spectra, the
simulation creates Monte Carlo realizations of a source
SED using an empirical model of S/N vs. wavelength de-
rived from the training sample described above. These
simulations were shown to accurately reproduce both
photometry and spectra for the K21 simulated training
sample.

The choice of model for simulating light curves and
spectra is in principle arbitrary, as SALTshaker is ca-
pable of training a model regardless of the underlying
simulation framework (Dai et al., in prep.). However, in
order to directly use M0 and M1 recovery precision as a
training accuracy metric, it is necessary to select a model
described by Equation 1. We therefore make two choices
to evaluate the accuracy of our model. First, we use the
model produced in Section 4.1 as the source SED, which
implicitly assumes that the trained SALT3-NIR model
is a perfect description of SNe Ia; this serves as a ﬂoor
for the validation stage. Second, we produce an iden-
tical set of simulations using SALT2-Extended (Section
2.2), which assumes the same formalism as SALT3-NIR
but has poorly trained color and stretch relationships
as well as a model surface that varies on much smaller
wavelength scales compared to SALT3-NIR (see Figure 6
and Pierel et al. 2018). As SALTshaker is designed to en-
sure a smoothly varying model in phase and wavelength,
we expect this scenario to result in a worse training per-
formance. However, this training is a useful exercise as
it gives a ceiling for training accuracy, in the case where

wavelength, top) and spectroscopic (bottom) data in the
K21+NIR training sample, as a function of rest-frame wave-
length and days relative to peak brightness (phase).

generally the agreement between the two models is quite
good, there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the JH-band
peak magnitudes. The impact of these diﬀerences on
the reference survey simulations for the Roman (Houn-
sell et al. 2018; Rose et al. 2021) is currently being in-
vestigated (Macias et al., in prep.).

Figure 7 shows the model ﬂux integrated over each
bandpass for the full optical+NIR range SALT3-NIR, as
a function of the light-curve stretch parameter, x1. This
relation makes the potential of NIR cosmology appar-
ent, as the JH bands have extremely uniform absolute
magnitudes and only a weak correlation with light-curve
stretch compared to the optical. The sharp variation in
the z band around +20 days is likely a training artifact,
perhaps due to a lack of suﬃcient coverage in the x1
parameter at this phase/wavelength combination. Fig-

the frequency of true variability is higher than the level
SALTshaker is designed to encode into the ﬁnal model
surface.

As K21 have already conﬁrmed that SALTshaker ac-
curately produces a model given a simulated train-
ing sample with realistic SN Ia population parameters,
here we check that SALTshaker recovers the underlying
NIR model components when training over the updated
wavelength range. We therefore produce simulated light
curves with the same cadence, ﬁlter coverage, number
of observations, redshift, and S/N as the true training
sample, as well as the same number of spectra with
matching wavelength coverage. We do not match the
model parameter distributions of x1 and c identically

to those of the training sample (as K21 did), but in-
stead sample Gaussian distributions that encompass the
full range in expected values for these parameters (i.e.,
µx1 = 0, σx1 = 1 and µc = 0, σc = 0.1). The resulting
simulation enables us to check if SALTshaker is robust in
recovering model surfaces over the entire plausible range
in model parameters, given the same volume of data as
the training sample in Section 3.2.5.

We create 10 distinct realizations of each simulated
training set to ensure suﬃcient statistical sampling, and
Figure 9 displays the agreement of key parameters be-
tween randomly selected simulations and the training
sample from Section 3. While the simulations are not
expected to be a perfect representation of the data, these

key distributions of redshift, mB, and maximum S/N are
all suﬃciently well-matched to accept the simulations as
appropriate representations of the training sample. An
example of observed and simulated NIR spectra is shown
in Figure 10.

5.2. Training on Simulations with SALTShaker
We train a version of SALT3-NIR on each of the sim-
ulated training samples described in Section 5.1. After
integrating the simulated and trained M0 and M1 com-
ponents over the Y JH bandpasses, we compare the re-
covered model surfaces to those input in the simulation.
The SALT3-NIR simulation is an optimistic scenario,
in which the training process is perfectly suited to the
data. As a result, we ﬁnd that the M0 component is
constrained to within ∼ 2% across nearly the full phase
range. SALTshaker also recovers the M1 component to
within ∼ 1% over the same phase range, despite present
phase gaps in the NIR training sample (Figure 11). This
is due in part to the relatively small M1 amplitude com-
pared to the M0 component (Figure 6).

On the other hand, the SALT2-Extended simulation
is the “pessimistic” scenario, in the sense that its behav-
ior has spurious variability beyond what SALTshaker is
attempting to represent. Nevertheless, Figure 12 shows
that SALTshaker is still capable of retrieving the M0
model component to within ∼ 2–3% over much of the
phase range. The M1 component is more poorly re-
trieved, likely because the high variability in SALT2-
Extended is treated as signal by SALTshaker, which is

ting a ﬁdelity target for the NIR to be reliably used for
cosmology.

ulated using SALT3-NIR as the source SED. The B band is
shown as a target model ﬁdelity for cosmology.

5.3. Comparison with SALT3
The diﬀerences in optical color scatter shown in Fig-
ure 8b demonstrate that simultaneously training the op-
tical and NIR slightly degrades the optical model per-
formance. Some variation in scatter is expected, as

the model surfaces are continuous in wavelength, but
the cause of this degradation is not understood. The
most likely culprits are either (a) the NIR is not nearly
as well-constrained as the optical owing to a lack of
suﬃcient data, and therefore the NIR scatter impacts
optical wavelengths, or (b) the NIR ﬂux is more uni-
form compared with the optical but SALTshaker is only
able to weight individual ﬁlters instead of the optical
as a whole, which increases the color scatter at optical
wavelengths. While the following section suggests that
the latter hypothesis is correct, the SALT3 optical-only
model should be used in SN Ia cosmology analyses until
this optical+NIR scatter issue is understood.

Nevertheless, here we check that optical distances
measured with SALT3-NIR are comparable to those of
SALT3 by ﬁtting the 10 SALT2-Extended simulated
training samples from Section 5.2 with both models, us-
ing optical data only and the methods described in Sec-
tion 2.1. The results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.
The α (β) parameter shown is the coeﬃcient of relation
between SN Ia luminosity and stretch (color), shown in
Equation 2. The two models agree within 3σ (or < 2%)
for β, but a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in α (∼ 20%) sug-
gests that the NIR training process impacts the overall
stretch-luminosity correlation. Since we ignore distance-
bias corrections (Section 2.1), the absolute values of
α and β should not be compared with other studies,
but are instead intended for direct comparison between
SALT3 and SALT3-NIR. Although there are diﬀerences
in the measured α and β parameters, we ﬁnd that the

slope of the x1 (c) correlation from measurements with
each model is 1.04 (0.99) with a root mean square error
(RMSE) of 0.13 (0.02), meaning light-curve parameter
measurements are essentially identical for the two mod-
els. The Hubble residual root-mean square (RMS) is
also not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the two models.
Table 3 shows that diﬀerences in optical distance mea-
surements are (cid:46) 0.01 mag, meaning that SALT3-NIR
is reliable for optical+NIR light-curve ﬁtting or simula-
tions. Here ∆µ is the binned residual between measured
distances for every simulated SN Ia, and in both tables
the uncertainties are the standard error on the mean
(SEM) calculated from the 10 simulated training sets.

5.4. Hubble Residuals
Finally, we examine the impact of the NIR in accu-
rately standardizing SNe Ia. First, we take the subset
of 105 SNe Ia in our training sample (Section 3) that
have suﬃcient rest-frame Y JH data for light-curve ﬁt-
ting without optical bands (i.e., at least 3 data points in
at least 1 NIR ﬁlter), and are at a suﬃciently high red-
shift such that the eﬀects of peculiar velocities are miti-
gated (i.e., z > 0.015). We ﬁt the optical (BV RI) light
curves in this sample with SALT3, and subsequently ﬁx
these time of peak estimates for NIR-only ﬁtting. We re-
ject SNe Ia with optically-ﬁtted parameters |c| > 0.3 or
|x1| > 3 (e.g., Scolnic et al. 2018). SALT3 and SALT3-
NIR distance measurements are derived following Sec-
tion 2.1. In all cases below the results shown for SALT3

are using only optical ﬁtting and the full set of SALT3
parameters, resulting in RMS values of 0.16–0.19 mag.
In addition to optical SALT3 constraints, we com-
pare SALT3-NIR distance measurements to distances
determined using the “SNooPy” ebv_model(2) (Burns
et al. 2011, 2014; Avelino et al. 2019; Jones et al. 2022).
SNooPy has been eﬀectively the only SN Ia light-curve
model capable of reliably ﬁtting the NIR for much of the
last decade8, and was trained on well-calibrated CSP
light curves (Burns et al. 2011; Krisciunas et al. 2017).
The more recent BayeSN model (Mandel et al. 2020)
also extends to the NIR and uses a diﬀerent light-curve
ﬁtting algorithm. However, the ﬁtting code is not cur-
rently open source, and we therefore restrict our com-
parison to SNooPy.

We split the NIR sample using all combinations of
rest-frame NIR ﬁlters (Y , J, H, Y J, Y H, JH, Y JH),
and ﬁt each subsample with both SALT3-NIR and
SNooPy. For each case, we ﬁt with only the light-
curve amplitude (i.e., x0 for SALT3-NIR and luminosity
distance for SNooPy), and separately ﬁt the amplitude
with model stretch (x1, sBV ). For subsamples with 2 or
more NIR ﬁlters, we attempt to include a color param-
eter (c, E(B − V )). We ﬁt with relaxed bounds of |c| <
1, |x1| < 4 for SALT3-NIR and |E(B − V )| < 1.3 mag,
0.7 < sBV < 1.3 for SNooPy (with RV = 1.518; Burns
et al. 2014).

Table 4 shows the results of this ﬁtting process. The
SALT3 RMS values correspond to the optical RMS for
the respective subsample, while the SALT3-NIR and
SNooPy RMS values are the result of ﬁts to the subsam-
ple using the given set of parameters. Both SALT3-NIR
and SNooPy use ﬂat priors for all parameters, and in
cases where stretch (color) is not ﬁt we ﬁx the value
to x1 = 0 (c = 0) for SALT3-NIR and sBV = 0.9
(E(B − V ) = 0 mag) for SNooPy. This choice is based
on Jones et al. (2022), who also found that shifting the
ﬁxed parameter value had a negligible impact on Hubble
residual RMS. Figure 13 shows the optical+NIR case,
while the scenario with the best SALT3-NIR RMS is
shown in Figure 14. We cannot ﬁt the optical+Y JH
case with SNooPy, as the optical data for a large num-
ber of the SNe Ia in this sample come from ATLAS,
whose wide bandpasses cause known issues with the K-
corrections necessary for SNooPy ﬁtting.

The numbers in each Table 4 section correspond to
results for the SNe Ia passing cuts for all subsamples in
that section. For example, in the ﬁrst section there are

44 SNe Ia that pass all of the Y , J, and H amplitude-
only ﬁtting procedures, and the RMS values shown (i.e.,
RMSY = 0.136, RMSJ = 0.161, RMSH = 0.145 mag for
SALT3-NIR) are based on those identical 44 SNe Ia.
This procedure enables a direct comparison between re-
sults in a given section, but signiﬁcantly reduces the
sample size in each row. For each amplitude-only ﬁt-
ting procedure, where far fewer ﬁts fail, we show the
RMS for all SNe Ia passing that single ﬁt in parenthe-
ses. For example while only 26 SNe Ia pass all 4 ﬁtting
procedures in the Y J section, 54 SNe Ia are successfully
ﬁt when ﬂoating only the amplitude. In this scenario,
SNooPy produced the lowest RMS while ﬁtting the am-
plitude only for the sample of 26 SNe Ia, but SALT3-NIR
performs the best on the full sample of 54 SNe Ia with
suﬃcient Y J data.

The SALT3-NIR RMS is lower than SNooPy in 20 of
29 scenarios, and only one scenario is more than 10%
higher. Optical distances with SALT3 only produce the
lowest RMS in 4 of the 29 scenarios, with the largest
diﬀerence being the JH-band ﬁtting (10–30%). In the
best SALT3-NIR case (Y J, ﬁtting the amplitude and
color parameters), we see a ∼ 30% reduction in residual
RMS compared to optical ﬁtting, with a similar eﬀect
seen when ﬁtting optical and NIR data simultaneously.
Although the sample here is small, we attempt to char-
acterize the signiﬁcance of this result by bootstrapping
the NIR-only sample. We deﬁne a new set of parameters

where δµi refers to the Hubble residual for the ith SN Ia.
We bootstrap the set of ∆µi values for every row in Ta-
ble 4 with 10,000 samples, and ﬁnd that ﬁtting the NIR
data alone provides a lower RMS than optical ﬁtting
in 8 scenarios with 95% conﬁdence. We also ﬁnd that
optical+NIR ﬁtting produces a lower RMS than optical-
only ﬁtting with 95% conﬁdence. This is in agreement
with Avelino et al. (2019), who found that using the
NIR, alone or with optical data, resulted in a signiﬁcant
improvement in Hubble residual RMS. However, this is
the ﬁrst attempt at applying stretch and/or color cor-
rections at NIR wavelengths, with these initial results
suggesting that stretch corrections at least are certainly
worthwhile in the current framework. All scenarios in
which the bootstrapping analysis conﬁrmed the SALT3-
NIR RMS is lower than SALT3 with > 95% conﬁdence
are bold in Table 4.

Figure 15 shows correlations between SALT3 and
SALT3-NIR for measured values of c, x1, and µ−µΛCDM
for the Y JH and Optical+Y JH ﬁtting scenarios de-
scribed above. Values measured by SALT3 are still using

optical data only, for the same SNe Ia ﬁt by SALT3-NIR.
As expected, when optical data are included in SALT3-
NIR ﬁtting, the correlation between SALT3 and SALT3-
NIR for each parameter is quite strong, with a slope
close to 1 for both c (0.98) and x1 (1.08). Interestingly,
there is still a strong correlation between measurements
of x1 when optical data are excluded from the SALT3-
NIR ﬁt (slope = 1.03, R = 0.71), though this relation-
ship should be investigated further as it appears driven
by a relatively small number of points. Nevertheless,
this suggests that the relationship between light-curve
stretch and luminosity impacts the NIR as well as the
optical, and that the NIR is capable of measuring this
relationship on its own. This is supported by consistent
improvements in Hubble residual RMS when a stretch
parameter is included in NIR-only ﬁtting, shown in Ta-
ble 4. On the other hand, attempts to measure the c
parameter using the NIR alone display very little cor-
relation with optical measurements. This is likely due
to the inherent diﬃculty in measuring color variation in
the NIR (e.g., a diﬀerence of ∆c = 0.1 changes the J −H
color by 0.003 mag and the B − V color by 0.1 mag), but
future work should investigate the possibility that this
result could be hinting at a diﬀerent physical origin for
NIR color variation compared to optical. We ﬁnd that
in cases where the diﬀerence between optical and NIR
measurements of c are large, there is a correspondingly
large and opposite diﬀerence in measurements of x1 that
lead to a relatively small change in distance.

6. CONCLUSION
We have used the open-source Python package
SALTshaker to extend the training of SALT3 to 2 µm.
The training sample has been left unchanged in the op-
tical, apart from optical counterparts to the new NIR
sample, so that SALT3-NIR is reliable across its full
wavelength range, with only slightly higher color scat-
ter in the optical. Future eﬀorts to improve the cali-
bration in the additional training sample, at both opti-
cal and NIR wavelengths, would increase the ﬁdelity of
the model. Using simulated training samples, we have
shown that SALT3 and SALT3-NIR optical distances
diﬀer by < 0.01 mag, and that SALTshaker is able to
constrain the source SED to within ∼ 2–3% in the NIR
given our data density, though (cid:46) 1% is the target for a
robust cosmological light-curve ﬁtter.

Still, with a sample of low-z SNe having rest-frame
NIR photometry, we ﬁnd that using SALT3-NIR pro-
duces comparable single-ﬁlter distance measurements
relative to the SNooPy light-curve ﬁtter (but improved
in Y, J). When adding multiple ﬁlters or ﬁtting stretch
and/or color parameters, SALT3-NIR provided NIR-

only Hubble residual RMS values ∼ 0.02-0.03 mag lower
than SNooPy, reaching < 0.11 mag, which is a ∼ 30%
improvement over SALT3 using optical ﬁlters for the
same SNe Ia. We also ﬁnd that Hubble residual scat-
ter is lower when using SALT3-NIR and only NIR data
than optical distances in 90% of our ﬁtting scenarios
(8 scenarios at > 95% conﬁdence), and that the RMS
from optical+NIR light-curve ﬁtting is also lower than
optical alone with 95% conﬁdence. These results are in
agreement with those of Avelino et al. (2019), who used
an amplitude-only ﬁtting procedure, but we ﬁnd that
stretch and color corrections provide a ∼ 10% improve-
ment when ﬁtting JH ﬁlters and can result in a simi-
lar RMS compared with optical+NIR ﬁtting. Overall,
we ﬁnd that NIR and optical stretch measurements cor-
relate well while color measurements are uncorrelated,

though both luminosity corrections often improve NIR
distance measurements (by up to ∼ 20% for JH ﬁlters
with a color correction). More work must be done to
understand if the diﬀerence between optical and NIR
color variation has a physical origin, or simply requires
innovations in the modeling or training process to fully
harness.

The indication that the NIR alone can provide a lower
RMS than optical+NIR, and the large diﬀerence in α
seen when ﬁtting optical light curves with both SALT3
and SALT3-NIR, suggest that future work should inves-
tigate whether adding a new model component to SALT
speciﬁcally for the NIR would improve distance mea-
surements. The lack of correlation between color mea-
sured with optical and NIR ﬁlters is likely another indi-
cator of this need. Mandel et al. (2022) found that op-

tical and NIR bands were relatively uncorrelated, which
could be providing similar evidence for this result. Sim-
ply allowing uncertainties in color scatter to be corre-
lated could be suﬃcient, and so this concept should also
be explored. Signiﬁcantly more data would be necessary
for this investigation, but it should be possible using Ro-
man.

The new wavelength range of SALT3-NIR will enable
the analysis of signiﬁcantly more SN Ia data with Ro-
man, all at z (cid:46) 1 in the rest-frame NIR where SNe Ia
have been shown repeatedly to be better standard can-
dles (e.g., Mandel et al. 2011; Dhawan et al. 2018;
Avelino et al. 2019, and see Section 5.4). Using the
reference High-latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS)
from Rose et al. (2021), Figure 16 shows the cumulative
fraction of all Roman HLTDS observations usable with
SALT3 and SALT3-NIR. At z (cid:38) 1 the models are equiv-
alent, as the Roman ﬁlters probe the rest-frame optical,
but at z (cid:46) 0.5 in particular SALT3-NIR will be able to

ﬁt ∼ 20% more data than SALT3, increasing to (cid:38) 85%
at z (cid:46) 0.1. Harnessing these lower-z SNe Ia will be par-
ticularly valuable for constraints on time-varying dark
energy, as they have greater constraining power than
other probes at these redshifts (e.g., Jassal et al. 2005;
Sendra & Lazkoz 2012).

The SALTshaker training process is ﬂexible, and will
easily accommodate new NIR data in the future to con-
tinually reﬁne the SALT3-NIR model as more data be-
come available. Roman in particular will provide a
wealth of high-precision rest-frame NIR data, includ-
ing hundreds or thousands of spectra (Rose et al. 2021),
which will drastically improve the SALT3-NIR training.
While a Roman-only NIR training sample for SALT is
plausible in the future, the work herein is necessary now
as a robust NIR training methodology, to enable more
accurate survey optimization, and produce early-mission
SN Ia photometric classiﬁcation. In advance of Roman
there are also a number of ground-based NIR surveys

with recent or upcoming public data releases that will
be added to the training sample (e.g., Johansson et al.
2021, Hsiao et al., Peterson et al., and Rubin et al.
in
prep.). Training SALT3-NIR in the SALTshaker frame-
work enables rigorous tests of potential systematic un-
certainties arising from the training sample itself, which
will be critical as new NIR data are created from fu-
ture observatories (e.g., Dai et al. and Jones et al., in
preparation).

The next decade of SN Ia cosmology is expected to
bring a new barrage of data in the NIR, which we
are now prepared to harness for improved SN Ia light-
curve standardization. SALT3-NIR currently provides
the only SED-based, open-source means of simulating,
classifying, and analyzing these new SNe Ia in coming
years9.
