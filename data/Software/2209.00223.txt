Abstract. Soft robots are made of compliant materials that perform
their tasks by deriving motion from elastic deformations. They are used
in various applications, e.g., for handling fragile objects, navigating sen-
sitive/complex environments, etc., and are typically actuated by Pneu-
matic/hydraulic loads. Though demands for soft robots are continuously
increasing in various engineering sectors, due to the lack of systematic
approaches, they are primarily designed manually. This paper presents
a systematic density-based topology optimization approach to designing
soft robots while considering the design-dependent behavior of the ac-
tuating loads. We use the Darcy law with the conceptualized drainage
term to model the design-dependent nature of the applied pressure loads.
The standard ﬁnite element is employed to evaluate the consistent nodal
loads from the obtained pressure ﬁeld. The robust topology optimization
formulation is used with the multi-criteria objective. The success of the
presented approach is demonstrated by designing a member/soft robot
of the pneumatic networks (PneuNets). The optimized member is com-
bined in several series to get diﬀerent PneuNets. Their CAD models are
generated, and they are studied with high-pressure loads in a commer-
cial software. Depending upon the number of members in the PneuNets,
diﬀerent output motions are noted.

Introduction

Soft robots are constituted by compliant materials and have monolithic lightweight
designs [1]. Such robots are actuated primarily by pneumatic/hydraulic (ﬂuidic
pressure) loads and use motion obtained from elastic deformation to perform
their tasks. Nowadays, they are being used in a wide range of applications, e.g.,
to handle fragile objects, fruits, and vegetables, in sensitive and unstructured
environments for navigation, etc. In addition, they provide high power-to-weight
ratios and help achieve complex motions [1]. Therefore, interest in designing them
for diﬀerent applications is constantly growing. The pneumatically/hydraulically
(pressure loads, air/water) actuated soft robots are sought the most and are

used relatively more. In general, soft robots are designed manually using heuris-
tic methods because of the lack of systematic approaches. Heuristic methods
greatly depend upon the designers’ knowledge and experience and may require
many resources/iterations. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to present a sys-
tematic approach using topology optimization for designing pressure-driven soft
robots. Figure 1 displays a schematic diagram of a soft robot with a bellow-
shaped pressure loading chamber. When pneumatic/hydraulic loads inﬂate the
chamber, it is desired that the output point P moves in a bending motion, as
shown by the red curved arrow.

Topology optimization (TO) provides an optimized material distribution for a
design problem by extremizing the desired objective under the given physical and
geometrical constraints. In a typical TO setting, the design domain is described
by ﬁnite elements (FEs, cf. [2]), and each element is assigned a design variable ρ ∈
[0, 1]. ρ = 0 and ρ = 1 indicate an element’s void and solid states, respectively.
The applied loads/actuating forces depending upon the applications soft robots
are designed for, can be either design-dependent, e.g., ﬂuidic pressure load [3], or
constant. A design-dependent load changes its location, magnitude, and direction
as TO advances and thus, poses several distinctive challenges [3].

Hiller and Lipson [4] used the evolutionary topology optimization approach to
design soft robots. Chen et al. [5] developed a soft cable-driven gripper using the
level-set topology optimization method. Zhang et al. [6] developed a soft pneu-
matic gripper by maximizing the output displacement. Pressure loads always act
normal to the boundaries of the design domain, which alter with TO iterations.
Therefore, including design-dependent behavior within the optimization formu-

lation is essential for ﬂuid pressure loads, which is not considered in Refs. [4–6].
In addition, Refs. [7, 8] mentioned that compliant mechanisms (CMs) optimized
using TO suﬀer from point (single-node) connections, and thus, they either be-
come challenging to realize or require post-processing. Further, the performance
of the post-processed designs may not be the same as that of their numerical
counterparts. Herein, we use the robust formulation presented in [9] to circum-
vent this issue, considering the design-dependent characteristics of pressure loads
for designing soft robots. Readers can refer to Refs. [10–13] and references therein
for designing various CMs for diﬀerent applications using TO.

Hammer and Olhoﬀ [14] were the ﬁrst to consider the design-dependent na-
ture of the pressure loads in TO while designing structures. Chen et al. [15]
used a ﬁctitious thermal model to design pressure-actuated compliant mecha-
nisms. Sigmund and Clausen [16] presented the mixed-ﬁnite element-based ap-
proach. Panganiban et al. [17] employed a non-conﬁrming FE method in their
approach for pressure-actuated CMs. The solid isotropic material with penaliza-
tion (SIMP) and moving isosurface threshold schemes are used by Vasista and
Tong [18]. de Souza and Silva [19] used the method presented in Ref. [16] with
a projection ﬁlter. Kumar et al. [3] presented a novel approach using the Darcy
law for pressure ﬁeld modeling. The method uses the standard FE method and
works ﬁne for designing 3D CMs [20]. Thus, we adopt the method to model
the pressure load. The prime goal herein is to design a member (soft robot) of
the pneumatic network (PneuNets, cf. [21]) to achieve the speciﬁed motion. The
optimized member is further connected in several series to get diﬀerent output
motions with high-pressure loads.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sec. 2 summarizes pres-
sure load modeling using the Darcy law in brief. TO formulation is provided in
Sec. 3. Sec. 4 presents an optimized design for a member of the PneuNet soft
robot. The optimized design is extracted, and its CAD model is made. The dif-
ferent networks are generated from the CAD model and further analyzed with
higher pressure loads in commercial software to achieve complex motions. Lastly,
the conclusions are drawn in Sec. 5.

2 Pressure load modeling

In this section, we present the pressure load modeling using the Darcy law in
brief herein for completeness. One can refer to [3] for a detailed description.

As TO advances, the material states of the associated FEs evolve. We already
have given boundaries with input pressure and zero pressure loads at the initial
stage of TO, i.e., a pressure diﬀerence across the domain is known. Therefore,
using the Darcy low to determine the pressure ﬁeld while assuming elements as
porous medium is natural. Given Darcy law, the ﬂux q is determined as

q = −

κ
µ

∇p = −K(¯ρ)∇p,

(1)

where ∇p is the pressure gradient. κ and µ represent the permeability of the
medium and the ﬂuid viscosity, respectively. ¯ρ indicates the physical design vari-

able. K(¯ρ) is called the ﬂow coeﬃcient. For element e, the ﬂow coeﬃcient is
deﬁned as [3]

K( ¯ρe) = Kv (1 − (1 − (cid:15))H( ¯ρe, βκ, ηκ)) ,
tanh (βκηκ)+tanh (βκ(1−ηκ)) , and (cid:15) = Ks
Kv

where H( ¯ρe, βκ, ηκ) = tanh (βκηκ)+tanh (βκ( ¯ρe−ηκ))
is called ﬂow con-
trast [20]. Ks and Kv are the ﬂow coeﬃcient of solid and void phases of element e
respectively. {ηκ, βκ} are termed ﬂow parameters which deﬁne respectively the
step position and slope of K( ¯ρe). To get the meaningful pressure distribution in
a TO setting, drainage, Qdrain, is conceptualized [3, 20]. The balanced equation
of Eq. 1 with the drainage can be determined as [3]:

(2)

∇ · q − Qdrain = 0.

(3)

where Qdrain = −D( ¯ρe)(p − pext) with D( ¯ρe) = DsH( ¯ρe, βd, ηd). {ηd, βd} are
the drainage parameters. In view of the fundamentals of the ﬁnite element for-
mulations, Eq. 3 transpires to [3]

Ap = 0,

(4)

in case both external pressure load and surface ﬂux are set equal to zero, which
is the case herein considered. A and p are the global ﬂow matrix and pressure
vector, respectively. Eq. 4 gives the pressure ﬁeld distribution within the design
domain as TO advances. We ﬁnd the consistent nodal loads from the pressure
ﬁeld distribution as [3]

F = −Tp

(5)

where F is the global force vector, and T is the transformation matrix [3]. To
summarize, with TO iterations, Eq. 4 and Eq. 5 are used to determine the
pressure ﬁeld and corresponding nodal force vector.

3 Topology optimization formulation

We use the robust formulation [9], i.e., the eroded, intermediate, and dilated
descriptions of the design ﬁeld, to ﬁnd the optimized designs for the soft robots.
The worst objective of the eroded, intermediate, and dilated designs is minimized
with the given volume fraction. Mathematically, the optimization formulation
can be written as [22]

where f0 is a multi-criteria objective, which is deﬁned by −s M SE
SE [23]. M SE
indicates the mutual strain energy, and SE represents the strain energy. M SE =
v(cid:62)Ku and SE = 1
2 u(cid:62)Ku. s is a consistent scale factor. As per [9], the volume
fraction is applied using the dilated ﬁeld and is updated with TO iterations. u
and v are the global displacement vectors obtained in response to the actual and
dummy forces, respectively. K is the global stiﬀness matrix. ¯ρ is the physical
design vector. ¯ρj of element j is determined as [9]

¯ρj( ˜ρj, β, η) =

tanh (βη) + tanh (β( ˜ρj − η))
tanh (βη) + tanh (β(1 − η))

,

(7)

where η ∈ [0, 1] deﬁnes the threshold, and β ∈ [0, ∞) controls the steepness of
the projection function. Generally, β is increased from 1 to a large ﬁnite value
using a continuation scheme. ˜ρj, the ﬁltered design variable of element j, is
deﬁned as [24]

˜ρj =

(cid:80)Ne

k=1 vkρkw(xk)
(cid:80)Ne
k=1 vkw(xk)

(8)

where Ne indicates the total number of elements used to parameterize the design
(cid:17)

domain, and vk is the volume of neighboring element k. w(xk) = max
rfill
is the weight function, wherein d = ||xj − xk|| is a Euclidean distance between
centroids xj and xk of elements j and k, respectively. One ﬁnds the derivative
of ¯ρj (Eq. 7) with respect to ˜ρj as:

(cid:16)

,

∂ ¯ρj
∂ ˜ρj

= β

1 − tanh(β( ˜ρj − η))2
tanh (βη) + tanh (β(1 − η))

.

(9)

Likewise, the derivative of ˜ρj (Eq. 8) with respect to ρk can be evaluated as

∂ ˜ρj
∂ρk

=

vkw(xk)
i=1 viw(xi)

(10)

Finally, using the chain rule one can ﬁnd the derivative a function f with respect
to ρk as

∂f

j=1

∂f

∂ ¯ρj

(11)

We use the modiﬁed SIMP material scheme [25] for ﬁnding Young’s modulus

of element j as

Ej = E0 + ( ¯ρj)χ(E1 − E0),

¯ρj ∈ [0, 1]

(12)

where χ is the SIMP parameter. E0 and E1 are Youngs’ moduli of the void and
solid states of an FE, respectively. E0
E1

= 1e−6 is set in this paper.

The Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA, cf. [26]), a gradient-based op-
timizer, is used to solve the optimization problem (Eq. 6). Thus, we need the
sensitivities of the objective and constraint with respect to the design variables,
which are determined using the adjoint-variable method. Complete detail on
sensitivity analysis can be found in [3, 22].

respectively. The input pressure load of 1 bar is applied using a circular chamber

a green arrow. kss indicates the work-piece stiﬀness. A predeﬁned void region of

In this section, a member of PneuNets (Fig. 1(B) of [21]) is designed using
the presented method. Diﬀerent PneuNets are constructed using the optimized
design to achieve complex motions with high-pressure loads, which we analyze
in a commercial software.

The design domain is displayed in Fig. 2. Lx = 0.1 m and Ly = 0.15 m indi-
cate respectively the dimension in x− and y−directions. The out-of-plane thick-
ness is set to 0.001 m. The input pressure load of 1 bar is applied at the center
of the domain, as shown in Fig. 2. Edges of the domain experience zero pressure
load. Half the length of the left edge is ﬁxed (Fig. 2). Workpiece of stiﬀness
kss = 1 × 104 N m−1 is used. The domain is parameterized using quadrilateral
FEs herein. Nex × Ney = 100 × 150 bi-linear quadrilateral FEs are used to de-
scribe the design domain, where FEs in x− and y−directions are represented
via Nex and Ney, respectively. Each element is assigned a design variable that is
considered constant within the element. The external move limit for the MMA

optimizer is set to 0.1. The maximum number of the MMA iterations is ﬁxed
to 400. The ﬁlter radius rﬁll = 6.0 × min

The permitted volume fraction is taken to 0.20. The robust parameter ∆η =

iterations, and once it reaches its maximum value of 128, it remains so for the
rest of the optimization iterations. The dilated volume is updated every 25 MMA
iterations. The higher β helps achieve a solution close to 0-1 that is measured
herein using the discreteness scale Mnd deﬁned in [25] as

For the mechanism, it is expected that as it is inﬂated with pressure load, the bot-
tom right corner of it should move down, i.e., motion in the negative y−direction
is sought (Fig. 2). The ﬂow contrast (cid:15) = 1 × 10−7 is used. Young’s modulus of
material E1 = 100 MPa, and Poisson’s ration ν = 0.40 are set. The ﬂow param-
eters {ηκ, βκ} = {0.20, 10} and the drainage parameters {ηd, βd} = {0.30, 10}
are taken.

The deformed and undeformed proﬁles. Red and blue colors indicate maximum
and minimum deformation locations. The chamber is pressurized by a 100 bar
load.

The optimized eroded, intermediate, and dilated designs with respective op-
timum pressure ﬁelds are displayed in Fig. 3. The optimized PneuNet design
gets an arbitrary-shaped chamber to contain the ﬂuidic pressure load in the op-
timized designs (Fig. 3), and that is expected to enhance the performance of
pneumatic networks. On the other hand, when PneuNets are designed by the
heuristic method, they typically have regular-shaped pressure chambers [21].

The eroded, intermediate, and dilated optimized mechanisms have identical
topologies. The intermediate design is taken for the blueprint/fabrication. The
eroded designs contain relatively thinner members, whereas the dilated designs
are thicker. As per the value of Mnd, the optimized designs are very close to 0-1,
i.e., black-white designs are obtained.

A member of PneuNet soft robot is designed with Pin = 1 bar while con-
sidering small deformation ﬁnite element assumptions in Fig. 3. However, soft
robots typically experience ﬁnite deformation while performing their tasks. In-
cluding nonlinear mechanics formulation within the proposed design approach
poses several other challenges, as mentioned in [22], and is out of the scope of the
current study. However, we extract the optimized intermediate design using the
technique mentioned in [22] (Fig. 3b) and study its behavior with high-pressure
loads using a neo-Hookean material model in a commercial software. In addi-
tion, we also form diﬀerent PneuNets from the optimized design displayed in
Fig. 3b and demonstrate their output deformation proﬁles. In [27] also a single
member is optimized ﬁrst and combined to get a pneumatic network. They use
polygonal/hexagonal [2] FEs to represent the design domain.

The intermediate optimized design of the soft robot is analyzed in ABAQUS
with Pin = 100 bar. The optimized design (Fig. 4a), its CAD model (Fig. 4b), and
deformed-undeformed proﬁles superimposed on each other (Fig. 4c) are shown
in Fig. 4. One can note that we get bending motion for the output node with
high-pressure loading, which is expected.

Next, we combine two (Fig. 5a) and four (Fig. 6a) members of the optimized
design to get diﬀerent PneuNets (Fig. 5b and Fig. 6b). The pressure chambers
of the designs are inﬂated using a 100 bar pressure load. The superimposed de-
formed and undeformed proﬁles for these robots are displayed in Fig. 5c and
Fig. 6c, respectively. As the number of members increases in the network, the
ﬁnal robot deforms relatively more and provides bending motion. With more

pneumatic members and high-pressure loads, the branches may interact and
come in contact, i.e., situations for self-contact may occur [28,29] and thus, pose
another set of challenges for designing such robots using TO. It can be noted
that the pressurized chambers become close to circular shapes in their deformed
proﬁles (Figs. 4c, 5c, and 6c); this is due because the pressure load acts normal
to the surface. In addition, as the number of PneuNet members increases, one
gets the complex output motions from the PneuNets, as depicted in Figs. 4c, 5c,
and 6c.

5 Closure

This paper presents a density-based topology optimization approach to design-
ing soft robots while considering the design-dependent nature of the actuat-
ing (ﬂuidic pneumatic) loads. The robust formulation is employed to subdue
point/single-node connections. To model the design-dependent character of the
pressure load, we use the Darcy law with a conceptualized drainage term per [3].

Towards topology optimization of pressure-driven soft robots

11

The consistent nodal loads are determined from the obtained pressure ﬁeld using
the standard ﬁnite element method.

The proposed approach is demonstrated by designing a PneuNet soft robot.
A min-max optimization problem is solved wherein the objective is determined
using the multi-criteria formulation. The Method of Moving Asymptotes is used
to solve the optimization problem. The optimized PneuNet gives the desired
motion and has an arbitrary-shaped pneumatic chamber. The optimized design
is combined to form numerous PneuNets, which provide diﬀerent movements
with high-pressure loads. Typically, soft robots experience ﬁnite deformation
during their performance. Thus, it is necessary to include nonlinear ﬁnite element
modeling within the optimization formulation, which forms the future direction
for this research.
