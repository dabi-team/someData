Abstract Events from alpha interactions on the surfaces of
germanium detectors are a major contribution to the back-
ground in germanium-based searches for neutrinoless double-
beta decay. Surface events are subject to charge trapping, af-
fecting their pulse shape and reconstructed energy. A study of
alpha events on the passivated end-plate of a segmented true-
coaxial n-type high-purity germanium detector is presented.
Charge trapping is analysed in detail and an existing pulse-
shape analysis technique to identify alpha events is veriﬁed
with mirror pulses observed in the non-collecting channels of
the segmented test detector. The observed radial dependence
of charge trapping conﬁrms previous results. A dependence
of the probability of charge trapping on the crystal axes is
observed for the ﬁrst time. A ﬁrst model to describe charge
trapping eﬀects within the framework of the simulation soft-
ware SolidStateDetectors.jl is introduced. The inﬂuence of
metalisation on events from low-energy gamma interactions
close to the passivated surface is also presented.

1 Introduction

High-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors are well suited to
search for physics beyond the Standard Model such as neutri-
noless double-beta (0𝜈𝛽𝛽) decay [1–5] and dark matter [6–
8]. In such rare-event searches, it is essential to suppress
background events as much as possible.

The LEGEND experiment [1, 5] will search for 0𝜈𝛽𝛽
decay in 76Ge using HPGe detectors based on the experience
of the preceding experiments Gerda [4, 9] and Majorana
Demonstrator [3, 10]. In these experiments, a substantial
part of the background events with observed energies close
to the 𝑄-value of the 0𝜈𝛽𝛽 decay (𝑄 𝛽𝛽 = 2039 keV) [2]
originates from events near the surface of the detectors [11].
Pulse-shape discrimination techniques have been developed

ae-mail: lhauert@mpp.mpg.de (corresponding author)

to reject such surface events [12], including a dedicated
method to identify events originating from the large pas-
sivated surfaces of the point-contact detectors of the Majo-
rana Demonstrator [13]. A substantial further reduction
of background is essential for LEGEND to reach its goal of
increasing the half-life sensitivity to 0𝜈𝛽𝛽 decay of 76Ge to
1028 years and beyond [5]. A deep understanding of the HPGe
detectors and their signal pulses is essential to achieve this.
A study of alpha events on the passivated surface of
the segmented true-coaxial n-type HPGe detector, "Super-
Siegfried" [14], was performed in the GALATEA test facil-
ity [15] at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich.
Such events are an important background to 0𝜈𝛽𝛽 decay
searches when charge trapping reduces the observed energy
to values within the region of interest around 𝑄 𝛽𝛽 [11].

For the ﬁrst time, the dependence of charge trapping on
the orientation of the crystal axes is presented. First attempts
to simulate surface eﬀects with the open-source software
package SolidStateDetectors.jl [16] are also shown.

In general, all contacts of germanium detectors are com-
pletely coated with a thin metal layer, i.e. are fully metalised.
However, the segments of the detector Super-Siegfried were
originally not fully metalised but were only partially met-
alised on a dedicated contact area. The results of studies [14]
where data were taken with partially metalised contacts were
compared to results from data taken after the segments be-
came fully metalised. The inﬂuence of the extent of the met-
alisation is demonstrated.

2 Experimental setup and data taking

GALATEA is based on a vacuum chamber in which the top
and side surfaces of a detector can be scanned using a system
of three motorised stages, see Fig. 1. The HPGe detector is
mounted on a holder, which is cooled via a copper cooling

ﬁnger submerged in an integrated liquid-nitrogen tank. The
ﬁll level of the tank is monitored and the internal tank is
automatically reﬁlled through a connected dewar.

The special feature of GALATEA is that the path between
the detector and the source is free of material, facilitating the
use of alpha sources. Two sources can be mounted in two
tungsten collimators focusing the radiation onto the mantle
and top plate of the detector, respectively. The collimators are
moved by linear stages and slide along slits on the side and top
of a silver-coated copper hat serving as an infrared shield. A
rotational stage moves these components around the detector,
such that almost any point on the detector top surface or
mantle can be irradiated. Signiﬁcant improvements of the
setup since previous studies [14], such as stable long-time
operation, automatised data taking and the use of open alpha
sources, allowed for more detailed studies of charge trapping.
Two open alpha 241Am sources, each with an activity
of 74 kBq, were installed in the two collimators allowing
for simultaneous scans of the side and the top of the de-
tector. The isotope 241Am decays into 237Np with dominant
alpha energies of 𝑄 𝛼1 = 5485.6 keV, 𝑄 𝛼2 = 5442.8 keV and
𝑄 𝛼3 = 5388.2 keV [17]. In addition, 237Np emits 59.5 keV
gammas. The alphas lose their energy within 20 µm of germa-
nium with the Bragg peak at 17 µm [18] and create events di-
rectly underneath the surface of the detector. Figure 2 shows
the observed spectrum in response to irradiation from the
side. The reduction of the observed energies with respect
to the emitted energies corresponds to the contact thickness
on the side of the detector. The width of the observed lines
arises from self-absorption in the source.

Super-Siegfried is a cylindrical true-coaxial n-type seg-
mented HPGe detector produced by Canberra France, now

Mirion Technologies [19]. The detector has a height of
70 mm, an outer radius of 37.5 mm and a borehole with a
radius of 5 mm. At the top and the bottom, the borehole
widens to a radius of 10 mm within about 3 mm. The im-
purity density as stated by the manufacturer of the crystal
3 at the

The lithium-drifted inner surface of the borehole (not

the so-called core contact. The outer mantle is segmented into

located above these 18 segments, segment 19, has a height
of 5 mm and is not segmented in 𝜑. It is read out via a
cable at 𝜑ro
135◦, see Fig. 3. Prior to the full metalisation,
the read-out cable for segment 19 was connected at about
the same location. The detector, as ready to be mounted
on the cooling ﬁnger in GALATEA, is depicted in Fig. 4.
The fairly thin segment 19 was designed to study events on
the passivated surface of the top end-plate. Charges drifting
towards the segment 19 contact also create strong so-called
mirror pulses in the segments underneath, which facilitate a
detailed pulse-shape analysis.

The positions of the two sources were calibrated by mov-
ing the collimators and identifying the segment boundaries
and the crystal axes as well as the relative position of the hold-
ing structure [18]. Figure 3b shows the position of the

spectively, as the charge carriers drift faster and slower along
these axes in germanium. All events recorded for a given

position of the sources are from here on called a measure-
ment. All positions refer to the positions of the centre of the
beam-spot on the detector surface. The individual measure-
ment positions on the top and side of the detector are also
shown in Fig. 3. They comprise two radial scans, RSF along
a fast axis and RSS along a slow axis, and two rotational
(azimuthal) scans, AST from the top at a ﬁxed radius of
23.8 mm and from the side at 𝑧 = 40 mm and ASS only from
the side on segment 19. The index 𝑗 is used throughout this
paper to refer the 𝑗-th measurement of the respective scan.
Each measurement of these four scans lasted one hour. In ad-
dition, a ﬁve hour long background measurement (BG) was
performed where the sources did not irradiate the detector.

The alpha beam from the top as provided by the setup
was simulated with Geant4 [21] to investigate the incident
spectrum and beam-spot on the top surface. A simulation
of monoenergetic 5.485 MeV alphas from the source in the
top collimator showed that the resulting spectrum has a tail
towards low energies, see Fig. 5. This tail is populated by

of the collimator or the edge of the slit in the infrared shield.
The shape and population of the beam-spot is shown in Fig. 6.
The sharp cut-oﬀ, perpendicular to the radial direction, is
caused by the additional collimation provided by the infrared
shield.

For a single event, 20 pulses (from the core and all 19 seg-
ments), each with 5000 samples, were recorded with a sam-
pling rate of 250 MHz by two 16-channel Struck SIS3316 [22]
analog-to-digital converter units. The index 𝑖
is
used throughout this paper to specify the channel. All de-
vices of GALATEA were controlled and monitored via one
software package, which allowed for automated scans of the
detector. The trigger was provided by the core channel con-
nected to the ﬁrst unit which forwarded its trigger signal to
the second unit via a short cable. The constant time delay of
the second unit was taken into account in the oﬄine pulse
processing [18].

vidual measurement with an automated procedure [23].

3 Alpha event characteristics and selection

The spectra of the calibrated core and segment 19 energies,
𝐸0 and 𝐸19, are shown in Fig. 8 for a measurement from AST
with both 241Am sources irradiating the detector. The signal
of the alphas hitting the top and the side of the detector are
well separated due to the diﬀerent structure of the surface lay-
ers. The respective backgrounds from natural radioactivity
are also shown for comparison.

Alphas deposit their energy in a small volume (< 1 mm3)
and create so-called single-site events. Thus, the collect-
ing segment for alpha events from the top is always seg-
ment 19 and 𝐸0 and 𝐸19 should be equal to one of the
𝑄 𝛼𝑘 , 𝑘
. However, Fig. 8 shows that the observed
energies, 𝐸0 and 𝐸19, of these top alpha events are massively
reduced compared to 𝑄 𝛼𝑘 and that these observed alpha en-
ergies form wide distributions instead of three peaks. In ad-
dition, the shape and central position of the distributions are
slightly diﬀerent in the core and segment 19. The reduction
of energy,
(2 MeV), is partially caused by a so-called dead
layer on top of the detector, where the created electron-hole
pairs recombine immediately and, thus, do not contribute to
the signal pulses. However, a dead layer alone can neither
explain the widths of the distributions nor the non-zero dif-
ference between 𝐸0 and 𝐸19. Both observations can only be
explained by the trapping of charge carriers during their drift
through the detector.

O

In this case, electrons or holes are trapped in the crystal
and do not reach a contact. After the other charge carriers are
collected, the trapped charge carriers still induce signals in
the contacts. This results in reduced and unequal values of 𝐸0
and 𝐸19, depending on the position of the trapping. In non-
collecting segments, so-called truncated mirror pulses [14]
are observed where the signal does not return to the baseline.
The characteristic pulses from an event with net hole
trapping, 𝐸19 < 𝐸0, are shown in Fig. 9. The collecting
segment 19 shows a lower energy than the core and the
two segments underneath, segments 9 and 10, show positive

truncated mirror pulses indicating net hole trapping. The
characteristic pulses from an event with net electron trapping,
𝐸0 < 𝐸19, are shown in Fig. 10, where negative truncated
mirror pulses are observed in segments 9 and 10.

Due to the feature of truncated mirror pulses, alpha events
aﬀected by charge trapping can also appear as so-called
multi-segment events even though they are single-site events.
Thus, a strict single-segment 19 cut, 𝐸0
𝐸19, cannot be
used to ﬁlter out events induced by environmental gammas,
which are often multi-segment events as the gammas pre-
dominantly perform Compton scattering at these energies.
However, in contrast to gamma induced events, the energies
measured in the other segments should never be larger than
𝐸19 for events induced by alphas from the top. Therefore, a
softer single-segment 19 cut was deﬁned to ﬁlter out gamma
events:

Alpha events aﬀected by charge trapping feature another
characteristic: After the correction for the speciﬁc decay of
charge in the preampliﬁers, pulses from "normal" events have
a ﬂat tail, see Fig. 7b. However, it has been shown that the
pulses of alpha events on passivated surfaces have positive
tail-slopes [13, 18] after the preampliﬁer speciﬁc correction
using the decay constants 𝜏𝑐
. These positive tail-slopes are
𝑖
visible in Fig. 9a and Fig. 10a. The possible physical origins
of the non-zero tail slopes of alpha-event pulses are a slow
release of trapped charge carriers or a very slow drift of a

events, for which most of the energy is deposited outside
of segment 19. After the S𝜏-cut, only alpha events on the
top remain. Above 1000 keV, they form a broad peak. It has
been cross-checked that the events in the energy region of the
broad alpha peak indeed form the secondary peak observed

in the 𝜏 distribution, conﬁrming that the 𝜏-cut selects alpha
events [18]. Similarly, analysing the mirror pulses from the

RSF (fast axis) and RSS (slow axis) are shown in Fig. 14 as
a function of 𝑟. The uncertainties on the ﬁtted values of 𝐸 𝜇
are only a few keV. These results conﬁrm the trends observed
previously [14] that for events at smaller radii hole trapping
dominates and moving towards segment 19 electron trapping
becomes dominant. This can be understood as a higher prob-
ability of charge trapping when the charge carriers have a
longer drift path towards the contacts. The result of the two
scans reveal a dependence of the amount of charge trapping
on the crystal axes orientation. The energies observed in the
scan along the fast axis are up to 1 MeV higher than those in
the scan along the slow axis.
The ﬁtted values of 𝐸 0

over 𝜑 are shown
in Fig. 15 for the measurements of the rotational scan AST

on 𝐸 0
. Near a fast axis, more energy is
recorded, which would imply a thinner dead layer or less net
trapping of charge carriers. The latter is reasonable as the
mobility for drifts along the fast axis is higher. An eﬀect of
the crystal axes on the observed alpha energies is seen for
the ﬁrst time in GALATEA. This was possible due to the
increased amount of data compared to previous studies [14].

in selecting alpha events with charge trapping. These checks
verify that the core pulse alone is suﬃcient to select alpha
events. Thus, the rejection of events based only on positive
tail slopes, is conﬁrmed to be an eﬀective way to reduce the
background for 0𝜈𝛽𝛽 decay searches. It should be noted that
signal events very close to the surface might also be rejected.

A dead layer alone can only equally reduce the alpha energy
observed in the core and segment 19. It can neither explain
the observed diﬀerences between 𝐸 0
nor
the observed truncated mirror pulses in non-collecting seg-
ments. The observed alpha energies can only be explained by
taking charge trapping eﬀects into account. There is no es-
tablished microscopic model available which includes charge
trapping. Here, a model consisting of three diﬀerent parts is
introduced to describe the radial dependence of 𝐸 0
and
𝐸 19
. The model was implemented using SolidStateDe-
tectors.jl (SSD) [16], which is an open-source package to
simulate solid-state detectors such as germanium detectors.
It is written in the Julia programming language and it com-
prises the calculation of the electric ﬁeld, E, the weighting
potentials [16, 24] of the contacts, 𝑊𝑖, the drift of the charge
carriers through the semiconductor and the induced signals
on the contacts. The drift of the charge carriers is calculated

This virtual volume is a tube directly underneath the top sur-
face with a height of 100 µm, ranging from 𝑟 = 10.05 mm
to 𝑟 = 37.45 mm. The height of the virtual volume is moti-
vated by the fact that charge trapping was not observed for
59.5 keV gammas also emitted by the 241Am source [18].
Most of these gammas interact with the germanium within
about 1 mm. Thus, only events very close,
(20 µm), to the
surface seem to be aﬀected by surface eﬀects. The modula-
tion of the drift vector, which corresponds to a modulation
of the mobility tensor, is justiﬁed as the assumption of an
inﬁnite crystal made in the derivation of the mobility tensors
for electrons and holes is not valid this close to the surface.
It is also clear that the environment of the detector has
to be taken into account in the simulation when handling
the drift of charge carriers close to surfaces. If the ﬁeld
simulation is limited to the volume of the detector, reﬂecting
boundary conditions are typically used at surfaces like the
passivated top plate. This, however, forces the 𝑧-component
of the electric ﬁeld,
𝑧, to be zero at the surface, which is
shown in Fig. 16a. Even though this actually leads to the
desired drift along the surface, it would incorrectly shift the
cause for it from the mobility tensor to the electric ﬁeld.
Thus, in order to learn something about the mobility tensor
close to surfaces, one has to use the correct electric ﬁeld,
which can have a non-zero 𝑧-component at these surfaces as
shown in Fig. 16b in which also the unmodulated drift paths
for one event at 𝑟 = 24.8 mm just underneath the top surface
are shown. The modulated drift paths of the event are shown
in Fig. 16c.

The probabilistic trapping of charge carriers is introduced

the top plate as a probability for the charge carrier (electron
or hole) to get trapped, 𝑝𝑒

those charge carriers could get trapped in each step of the
drift as described earlier. In the ﬁt, the seed for the random

used for each set of parameters and, therefore, each speciﬁc
set of parameters always resulted in the same simulated en-
ergies. It was tested and veriﬁed that the large number of
charge carriers ensured that the simulated energies of the
events were basically independent,

increases towards the mantle of the detector reducing the

suggests that the trapping probability is about a factor of
three higher for electrons than for holes.

energy distribution like seen in the data due to statistical
ﬂuctuations. The relatively low value of 𝑁ep = 30 resulting in
reasonably broad distributions could mean that the trapping
mechanism actually happens in some coherent way, such that
always a group of electrons or holes gets trapped during the
drift. Another explanation might be that there are certain
locations at the surface where charge carriers are more likely
to get trapped such that, again, a group of electrons or holes is
trapped at the same time or, respectively, at the same location.
Even though the model was not tuned to predict corre-
lations, correlations similar to the observed correlations are
produced. For events at lower and larger radii, see Fig. 20a
and Fig. 20c, the measured 2D-distributions are narrow and
stretched. This is also predicted by the simulation, see Fig. 20d
and Fig. 20f. It can be explained by the shapes of the weight-
ing potentials of the contacts, see Fig. 21. The gradient of the
weighting potential increases close to the respective contact.
For events at larger radii, the holes have only a short drift
path towards segment 19 and, thus, less holes are trapped
during the drift. In addition, trapped holes still contribute
signiﬁcantly to the segment 19 signal as they are close to the
contact. The electrons, however, are trapped at lower radii
where the gradient of the weighting potential of segment 19

induced from the top were, but also events induced from
121.8 keV gammas2, entering segment 19 from the side of the

T
segment 19 showed a very strong dependence on Δ𝜑 𝑗 [14, 26]

is basically zero. Thus, the exact location of the trapping of
electrons does not inﬂuence the signal of segment 19 after
the electrons moved inwards below a certain radial position,
where the weighting potential of segment 19 is almost con-
stant. Therefore, for events at small (large) radii the spread
of 𝐸19 (𝐸0) for a given 𝐸0 (𝐸19) is smaller than the spread of
𝐸0 (𝐸19) for a given 𝐸19 (𝐸0).

At medium radii, see Fig. 20b, a half-moon shaped distri-
bution is observed. This is not reproduced by the simulation,
see Fig. 20e. However, this is probably because the spread of
the beam-spot was not taken into account in the simulation.
All simulated events were spawned at the center of the beam-
spot. Taking the beam-spot into account, see Fig. 6, would
result in a superposition of the distributions for the diﬀerent
𝑟 in the beam-spot.

The simulation does not include the low-energy tails in
the data which are due to collimation eﬀects, see Fig. 5. It
produces normally shaped distributions for 𝐸0 and 𝐸19, see
Figs. 20d-f. It is, however, interesting that the low-energy
alphas seem to be aﬀected by charge trapping in the same
way as the high-energy alphas. The trapping mechanisms
seem to depend only on the location and not on the total
energy deposited.

6 Eﬀect of metalisation

In previous studies [14], a strong dependence of the rise time
of the pulses on 𝜑 was observed for both alpha and gamma
induced events in segment 19. For these studies, segment 19
was only metalised in a small area where the read-out cable
was, and is, connected to the segment at 𝜑ro = 135◦ over a
range of about 20◦. Since then, the detector was reprocessed
and segment 19 became fully metalised.

help to design germanium detectors such that events close to

7 Summary and outlook

Charge trapping was observed in alpha events on the pas-
sivated surface of the end-plate of an n-type true-coaxial
segmented HPGe detector. Such events occur with energies
in the region around 2 MeV where the signal for 0𝜈𝛽𝛽 decay
in 76Ge would appear. The trapping of holes and electrons
was clearly identiﬁed by truncated mirror pulses observed
on the segmented mantle of the detector. This identiﬁcation
conﬁrmed that alpha events can be selected eﬀectively by
analysing the tail slope of the core pulses. Thus, the back-
ground due to alphas on the passivated surfaces can be ef-
ﬁciently suppressed for detectors as used in the ﬁrst phase
of the LEGEND experiment currently under construction at
the Gran Sasso underground laboratory.

Radial scans of the detector top surface showed that
charge trapping is dominated by hole trapping for events at
small radii and by electron trapping for events at large radii
as expected from the length of the respective drift paths.
The trapping probability per µm/ns2 was found to be three
times larger for electrons than for holes for drifts directly
underneath the passivated top surface. A dependence of the
probability of charge trapping on the crystal axes has been
observed for the ﬁrst time in GALATEA. Near a fast axis,
, less net charge trapping is observed than near a slow
100
(cid:104)
axis,
. This can be understood as a consequence of
110
(cid:104)
higher mobilities along the fast axis.

(cid:105)

(cid:105)

Charge trapping was simulated with the open-source soft-
ware package SolidStateDetectors.jl. The radial dependence
of the probability of charge trapping can be described by a
model including a radius-dependent dead layer, a modula-
tion of the charge-carrier mobility and probabilistic charge
trapping of electrons and holes. In the future, the model can
be extended to take crystal axes eﬀects into account in order
to describe the azimuthal dependence. In addition, new ver-
sions of SolidStateDetectors.jl can take charge-cloud eﬀects
like diﬀusion and self-repulsion into account. Furthermore,
the non-zero tail slope, used to identify surface alpha events,
could be added to the simulation by introducing a proba-
bilistic release of trapped charge carriers in each step similar
to the trapping probability, or by letting the trapped charge
carriers still drift with a very low velocity.

The inﬂuence of the segment metalisation on the pulse
shapes of events close to the passivated top surface of the
detector was studied. In previous studies, very long pulses
were observed close to the top for a metalisation scheme
where only small areas were metalised. For a full metalisa-
tion, normal (faster) pulses and a much weaker dependence
of the rise times on the event position with respect to the
position of the read-out contact were observed. However, a
small 𝜑 dependence beyond the crystal axes modulation was
observed even for full metalisation. Metalisation schemes

could be used to inﬂuence the pulses of surface events to
facilitate easier identiﬁcation of such events.
