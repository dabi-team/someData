ABSTRACT
We present the method behind HubPUG, a software tool built for recovering systemic proper motions (PMs) of Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) ﬁelds with two epochs of observations by utilizing stars observed by Gaia as a foreground frame of reference.
HST PM experiments have typically relied on the use of distant background galaxies or quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) as stationary
sources against which to measure PMs. Without consistent proﬁles, background galaxies are more diﬃcult to centroid, but
beneﬁt on-aggregate from their large numbers. QSOs, though they can be ﬁt with stellar point-spread functions, are sparse, with
most ﬁelds containing none. Historically, the use of stars as references against which to measure PMs would have been diﬃcult
because they have individual PMs of their own. However, Gaia has now provided positions and PMs for over 1.4 billion stars,
which are much more likely to be well-imaged in the ﬁelds around targets versus background sources, have predictable stellar
proﬁles, and require less observing time per-image for good signal-to-noise. This technique allows us to utilize the power of
Gaia to measure the PM of targets too faint for Gaia to observe itself. We have recovered PMs for the Milky Way satellites
Sculptor and Draco with comparable uncertainties over HST-only and Gaia-only measurements, limited primarily by the current
capabilities of the Gaia data. We also show the promise of this method for satellites of M31 with a new PM measurement for
Andromeda VII.

1 INTRODUCTION

On the scale of the Local Group (LG) – the Andromeda (M31) and
Milky Way (MW) systems – the motions that we measure of galax-
ies on the sky (their proper motions; PMs) can tell us a great deal
about problems in near-ﬁeld ΛCDM cosmology and about galaxy
evolution. For instance, PMs have allowed us to probe the appar-
ent existence of satellite planes (e.g., Lynden-Bell 1976; Kunkel &
Demers 1976; Kroupa et al. 2005). Both the MW’s Vast Polar Struc-
ture (e.g., Pawlowski et al. 2012; Sohn et al. 2017; Fritz et al. 2018;
Pace & Li 2019; Pawlowski & Kroupa 2020) and the Great Plane of
Andromeda (Sohn et al. 2020; Pawlowski & Sohn 2021) have been
explored in recent years using data from HST and the Gaia Survey
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016). Additionally, the nature of dark mat-
ter (DM) and halo substructure is also expected to be clariﬁed with
more precise PM measurements. For example, PMs could help break
the degeneracy between the density proﬁle and stellar anisotropy, al-
lowing for better characterization of the central DM density (Strigari
et al. 2007; Read et al. 2021; Guerra et al. 2021).

As pertains to galaxy evolution, with Gaia-based PMs we have
learned more about accretion and merger events in the assembly of
the MW (e.g., Belokurov et al. 2018; Haywood et al. 2018; Helmi
et al. 2018; Venn 2018) and the Magellanic System (e.g., Kallivay-
alil et al. 2018; Fritz et al. 2018; Simon 2019; Erkal & Belokurov
2020; Patel et al. 2020). Pairing PM measurements with HST star-
formation histories (SFHs) has established the relationship between
dwarf galaxies and reionization (e.g., Brown et al. 2014; Weisz et al.
2014; Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2015) and allowed us to explore environ-
mental inﬂuences on star formation in the faintest of galaxies (Sacchi
et al. 2021).

While more than 75% of the observed MW satellites are being
studied in detail with current PM information (e.g., McConnachie
& Venn 2020; Li et al. 2021; Pace et al. 2022), to date, only two
M31 dwarf satellites (NGC 147 and NGC 185, by Sohn et al. 2020)
have HST-based PM measurements. This can partially be attributed
to how time-expensive these experiments have historically been. To
measure the PM of distant objects such as dwarf galaxies, at least
two epochs of images need to be taken with a time-baseline 𝑡 (cid:38) 5
years, and these images must have the precision to be able to resolve
motions (cid:46) (0.01 mas/yr) × 𝑡. The use of HST’s Advanced Camera

For Surveys/Wide Field Channel (ACS/WFC; and/or HST’s Wide-
Field Camera 3 [WFC3]) is therefore crucial for its ability to capture
high-precision astrometry, which can be further enhanced through
observational strategies, e.g., dithering to fully sample a star’s point-
spread function (PSF).

In order to measure the PM of a ﬁeld of stars, a common frame-
of-reference is needed across observational epochs. Traditionally,
background galaxies and/or quasi-stellar objects (QSOs, or ‘quasars’)
– objects distant enough to be approximately stationary between
epochs – are used as references against which it is possible to track
the motion of the stars in a target galaxy. Therefore, exposure times
for observations not only need to be planned to obtain adequate
signal-to-noise (S/N) for the dwarf galaxy’s stellar component, but
also for these background sources. In the case of Sohn et al. (2020),
each of the ﬁrst- and second-epoch images used for their targets had
exposure times of ∼1400 seconds in the F606W ﬁlter (with 20 images
being taken for the ﬁrst epoch and 8 for the second). The analysis and
astrometric reduction for these experiments can also be intensive,
requiring careful treatment of instrumental geometric distortions,
cross-detector PSFs, and centroiding of background sources.

However, the data from the Gaia survey, including the recent Early
Data Release 3 (eDR3; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021) and Data
Release 3 (DR3; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022), have oﬀered a new
opportunity to greatly expand the sample of dwarf galaxies with
resolved PMs. Gaia DR3 provides sky positions and PMs for over
1.4 billion stars. Though a majority of these sources are Galactic,
the catalog does include data for bright stars in the MW halo and its
satellites. Therefore, a target galaxy’s systemic PM can be measured
by averaging the stellar PMs measured by Gaia for stars that are likely
members of the target galaxy (we abbreviate this method as ‘Gaia-
only’). This has been done by, e.g., Fritz et al. (2018) with Gaia
Data Release 2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) and by Battaglia
et al. (2021), Li et al. (2021), and Martínez-García et al. (2021)
with eDR3. The value of the Gaia data and this method is hard to
overstate: Battaglia et al. (2021) provides PM measurements for 74
LG satellites, and Li et al. (2021) recovers full orbital parameters for
46 MW dwarfs.

Despite its unquestionable utility for directly recovering systemic
PMs, the Gaia-only method is only possible for galaxies with an
adequate number of members bright enough such that they have
stellar PMs measured by Gaia. Therefore, this method is limited
to targets in the MW’s halo and the brightest of M31’s satellites
(e.g., M33). However, as well as being powerful in its own right, the
Gaia data may also serve as a component in making high-precision
measurements of satellite PMs when combined with data from HST.
Historically, stationary background sources have been used, in
part, because of the diﬃculty of using foreground sources that have
PMs of their own. However, this comes with the trade-oﬀ that the
proﬁles of background galaxies are not uniform (as opposed to the
consistent stellar PSF), and so the positions of these sources are more
diﬃcult to measure. QSOs, also being point-sources, can be ﬁt using
stellar proﬁles, but these sources are very sparse in the backgrounds
of target ﬁelds (most ﬁelds will have none). On the other hand, while
foreground MW stars have motions of their own, these motions have
now been measured and reported using Gaia. Thus, notwithstanding
whether or not a star is a member of a target galaxy, these individual
PMs can be theoretically subtracted away after comparing how these
foreground stars move in reference to a target galaxy over time,
revealing a measurement of the target’s systemic PM.

Because these foreground stars will be, on average, brighter than
the target’s member stars, using foreground sources may allow for less
time-expensive experiments, as we will not need to consider added

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2022)

exposure time to increase the S/N of faint background galaxies. In
addition, because foreground stars can be ﬁt with the same stellar
PSFs as the stars of target galaxies, we should be able to obtain more
precise positions of these references in each of the HST epochs versus
background galaxies. This may especially be relevant for combining
observations from diﬀerent ﬁlters and/or instruments, where the the
cross-ﬁlter centroiding of stellar proﬁles is much more robust than
the proﬁles of extended objects. Therefore, we would expect this
method to be probing the limits of the precision possible with HST
astrometry. In fact, though the most signiﬁcant limits should be from
the uncertainty associated with Gaia’s stellar PM measurements and
from the number of foreground stars in an HST ﬁeld, the addition of
HST data has the potential to provide more precise estimates for the
PMs of targets that already have purely Gaia-derived measurements.
There are already a few examples in the literature of attempts
at combining HST and Gaia data for PMs. Casetti-Dinescu et al.
(2021) combined observations from multiple HST Wide Field and
Planetary Camera 2 epochs and Gaia eDR3 to obtain a PM of Leo I,
using the average ‘oﬀset’ between the Gaia-reported stellar PMs and
the PMs of these stars as implied by their movements between the
HST epochs and the Gaia frame-of-reference as a correction to the
HST-derived motions. Their team recovered values within 1𝜎 of the
multi-study average value calculated from the literature. Similarly,
the GaiaHub tool (del Pino et al. 2022) allows Gaia to be used
as a second epoch to an HST observation to ﬁnd relative PMs and
velocity dispersions within ﬁelds. This is similar to previous work
that was done recovering PMs for Sculptor and Draco by Massari
et al. (2018) and Massari et al. (2020), respectively, where the stellar
positions from Gaia DR2 were used as a second epoch against the
ﬁrst epoch HST-derived positions of these same stars to estimate
absolute PMs.

In this paper, we accelerate this exciting eﬀort to unify data from
HST and Gaia, presenting the method behind our software package
HubPUG (Hubble Proper motions Utilizing Gaia), an application
capable of recovering the systematic PMs of ﬁelds with two epochs
of HST observations by measuring the motion of stars observed
by Gaia against the average of the ﬁeld over time. Along with the
method, we present tests using this application on ﬁve targets – two
satellites of the MW and three satellites of M31.

Our MW satellite targets, Sculptor and Draco, have been chosen
to verify the accuracy of this method for nearby ﬁelds. Sculptor
and Draco are classical dwarfs (𝑀★ ∼ 107 M(cid:12)) located at similar
heliocentric distances (86 and 76 kpc; McConnachie 2012) and have
been a prime focus of PM experiments, dating back to the mid-1990s
(Schweitzer et al. 1995 for Sculptor; Scholz & Irwin 1994 for Draco).
In the last two decades, the precision of these measurements has been
immensely advanced with the use of HST data (e.g., Piatek et al.
2006; Pryor et al. 2015; Sohn et al. 2017; Massari et al. 2018, 2020),
observations from the Subaru Suprime-Cam (for Draco, Casetti-
Dinescu & Girard 2016), and with Gaia stellar PM measurements
(such as from Martínez-García et al. 2021).

As additional test cases of the limits of our method at M31 dis-
tances, we measure PMs for NGC 147, NGC 185, and Andromeda
VII (And VII). NGC 147 and NGC 185 are relatively bright dwarf
elliptical (dE) galaxies sitting comfortably within the halo of M31
(107 and 154 kpc from M31; McConnachie 2012; Savino et al. 2022)
with ACS/WFC-based PMs and orbital histories presented in Sohn
et al. (2020). Our ﬁnal target, the M31 satellite And VII, lies at a
distance of 231 kpc from M31 (McConnachie 2012; Savino et al.
2022). While the stellar population (e.g., Navabi et al. 2021) and
radial velocity (Kalirai et al. 2010) of this galaxy have been studied
using HST data, it does not have a measured PM. And VII oﬀers an

attempt to utilize archival data of overlapping ﬁelds to recover a novel
result that would increase the number of M31 dwarf PMs measured
using HST by 50%.

2 OBSERVATIONS

The HST ACS/WFC observations of Sculptor and Draco that we use
to measure PMs are for the 3 ﬁelds of Draco (F1, F2, F3) and 2
ﬁelds of Sculptor (F1, F2) that were also used by Sohn et al. (2017).
For Draco, the ﬁrst-epoch observations were taken in 2004 October
(GO-10229; PI: S. Piatek) in the F606W ﬁlter (broad V) and the
second-epoch observations were taken in 2013 October (GO-12966;
PI: R. van der Marel) with the same ﬁlter, pointing, and orientation
as the ﬁrst epoch. The observations for Sculptor were taken in 2002
September (GO-9480; PI: J. Rhodes) and 2013 September (GO-
12966) in the F775W ﬁlter (SDSS i), also with the same pointing
and orientation as the ﬁrst. This matching of the ﬁlter, pointing, and
orientation between epochs is useful especially for PM experiments,
as it may help minimize the eﬀects of instrumental- and ﬁlter-based
systematics. Exposure times for all of these observations were on
the order of 500 seconds. This is helpful for our purposes, as it
ensures that the majority of observed Gaia sources are not saturated
on the detector while still being photometrically deep enough for an
adequate sample of stars in the chosen target.

Similarly, NGC 147 and NGC 185 have observations that were
speciﬁcally set up with measuring PMs in mind; i.e., second-epoch
observations with pointings and orientations identical to the ﬁrst as
well as identical exposure times and ﬁlters between epochs. First-
epoch observations for NGC 147 were taken in 2009 November
(GO-11724; PI: M. Geha) and second epoch observations in 2017
November (GO-14769; PI: S. T. Sohn). For NGC 185, the ﬁrst epoch
was taken 2010 January (GO-11724) and the second epoch 2017
December (GO-14769). All observations that we use were taken in
the F606W ﬁlter.

These observations of NGC 147 and NGC 185 have both bene-
ﬁts and drawbacks when it comes to the goals of our experiment;
while their setup was speciﬁcally designed for the recovery of these
galaxies’ PMs, the PM experiment in mind was to use background
sources. Therefore, long exposure times (𝑡exp ≈ 1400 s) were cho-
sen in order to maximize the S/N of these background sources in
every image taken. This means that while we do have deep photom-
etry for the galaxies in question, we also ﬁnd that all of the bright,
foreground MW stars are saturated on the detector. Therefore, suc-
cessfully recovering a PM with these data requires being able to
perform accurate astrometry on sources multiple magnitudes above
the detector’s saturation threshold.

The other M31 satellite in our sample, And VII, has observations
that were not optimized for PM measurements. And VII has ﬁrst
epoch ACS observations in the F555W ﬁlter (Johnson V) taken in
2006 June (GO-10430; PI: T. Armandroﬀ) and second-epoch obser-
vations from 2020 August (GO-15902; PI: D. Weisz) in F606W. In
addition to being in slightly diﬀerent band-passes, these observations
diﬀer in pointing, orientation, and exposure time. However, the ﬁelds
from the two epochs do have considerable overlap. Exposure times
for the ﬁrst epoch images are 600 seconds and for the second epoch
images are ∼1100 seconds. Accordingly, we ﬁnd that none of the
foreground Gaia stars are saturated in the ﬁrst epoch of images but
only a handful remain unsaturated in the second set.

3 DATA PROCESSING

hst1pass (h1p; Anderson 2022) is a PSF photometry and astrome-
try tool that enables ﬁnding point-sources within HST flt/flc im-
ages. flc images, obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space
Telescopes (MAST) HST search,1 are pre-processed to be bias- and
dark-subtracted, ﬂat-ﬁelded, and corrected for HST’s charge trans-
fer eﬃciency (CTE) eﬀects. h1p ﬁnds sources, taking into account
ﬁlter-dependent geometric-distortion corrections (GDCs) for the in-
strument used to capture the images, and ﬁts for sources using the
proper empirically-derived point-spread functions (ePSFs). h1p then
returns both raw (𝑥, 𝑦) and distortion-corrected (𝑋, 𝑌 ) detector po-
sitions of the centres of each ﬁt ePSF, right ascensions (RA) and
declinations (DEC) from the distortion-corrected World Coordinate
System header for each image, along with the object’s instrumental
magnitude.

We then apply a rotation to the (𝑋, 𝑌 ) coordinates,

𝑋new = Δ𝑋 cos (O) − Δ𝑌 sin (O),
𝑌new = Δ𝑋 sin (O) + Δ𝑌 cos (O),

(1)

where Δ𝑋 = 𝑋 − 𝑎1 and Δ𝑌 = 𝑌 − 𝑎2, and 𝑎1, 𝑎2, and O represent
the variables POSTARG1, POSTARG2, and PA_APER, respectively,
from the flc image headers. This operation rotates the (𝑋, 𝑌 ) coor-
dinate frame around the image target so that 𝑋 is aligned with the
sky-west direction (i.e., along RA) and 𝑌 is aligned with the sky-north
direction (along DEC). A beneﬁt of performing this operation now
rather than while constructing the PMs is that it forces the scatter in
the 𝑋 and 𝑌 directions (after source matching and transforming the
2
images) to more directly correspond with the uncertainties in 𝜇∗
𝛼
and 𝜇 𝛿.

In order to use h1p to get source positions, you must choose the
proper starting ePSF and GDC ﬁles. In general, it is best to choose
the ePSF and GDC that match the ﬁlter and HST service-mission of
the image being processed. However, there are not ePSFs available
for every ﬁlter; for instance, the F555W ﬁlter, which was used for the
ﬁrst-epoch And VII observations and for Draco F3, does not have
an ePSF. In these scenarios, it is advised to use the ePSF for the
closest ﬁlter (F606W for F555W, in our case). Running h1p with
PERT5=YES allows the ePSF to be perturbed over the image being
processed on a ﬁve-by-ﬁve grid, adapting the starting ePSF to the
ﬁlter being used. In general, this setting is advisable even when the
ePSF matches the image’s ﬁlter, as this perturbation also accounts for
time-dependent and image-speciﬁc anomalies in the PSF. In general,
however, each set of images being processed requires some degree
of trial and experimentation. We have also found, for instance, that
using the F814W ePSF (broad I-band) for images taken in F775W
results in better ﬁts than using the F775W-speciﬁc ePSF.

For analysing a run of h1p, the output provides a parameter that
characterizes the quality of the ePSF ﬁt, 𝑞, where approaching 0
indicates a better ﬁt, with 𝑞 (cid:46) 0.2 for conﬁdently star-like sources
(Anderson 2022). 𝑞 is a useful diagnostic both to check the quality of
astrometry returned from a run of h1p and for setting bounds in the
subsequent steps for stars that are more likely to be foreground and
for what stars should be included in image transformations. In the
case of And VII, the 𝑞 parameter seems to show that there is good
conversion between the PSF ﬁt and the image, with 𝑞 then increasing
as we approach the saturation threshold just past 𝑚instr (cid:39) −14, which

𝛼 = 𝜇𝛼 · cos ( 𝛿). This takes into account that the lines of RA converge
towards the poles, and puts the units on the same scale as 𝜇𝛿 for all values of
RA.

also corresponds with an increase in overall position scatter (Figure
1).

After constructing this source list, we run a query of the Gaia
archive for stars with Gaia eDR3 data that are within the stamp on
the sky covered by our images’ ﬁelds-of-view. Stars selected must
also ﬁt the Gaia parameters:

ruwe < 1.1,
ipd_gof_harmonic_amplitude <= 0.2,
visibility_periods_used >= 9,
astrometric_excess_noise_sig <= 2,
pmra_error < 1,
pmdec_error < 1,
parallax_error < 0.7,

which ensures that we are choosing stars that are unlikely to be
binaries and have high-quality measurements for their stellar PMs.
This list is then cross-matched on (RA, DEC) with the source lists
from h1p after propagating the Gaia stellar positions for each epoch
using the Gaia ADQL function EPOCH_PROP_POS.

In addition, we search the target ﬁeld against objects in the Mil-
lion Quasars Catalog (Flesch 2021). Because QSOs are of relatively
meager numbers compared to stars or galaxies, this search fails to
return any matches for most ﬁelds; of our 6 targets, only the ﬁelds
of Draco contained QSOs from this catalogue (in fact, these ﬁelds
were originally targeted on QSOs). However, since these sources
have no PMs of their own (i.e., are approximately stationary on the
sky), ﬁelds where these sources do appear beneﬁt greatly, as the only
source of uncertainty for these objects is from the HST centroiding
and transformation.

Using a ﬁeld’s total list of stars and their distortion-corrected
(𝑋, 𝑌 ) positions in each image, the original h1p coordinates of all
stars (𝑋in, 𝑌in) are transformed by ﬁtting for the parameters in the

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2022)

6-dimensional transformation:

𝑋new = 𝐴𝑋 + 𝐵𝑋 · 𝑋in + 𝐶𝑋 · 𝑌in
𝑌new = 𝐴𝑌 + 𝐵𝑌 · 𝑋in + 𝐶𝑌 · 𝑌in,

(2)

with the 𝐴 terms capturing translational oﬀsets and the 𝐵 and 𝐶
terms capturing the magniﬁcation, skew, and rotation of 𝑋 and 𝑌 .
An independent ﬁt using Equation 2 is made for each image using
its member list,3 and then stars are cut from all lists for which the
average standard deviation of the star’s separation from the reference
location in all images is higher than a set tolerance. This ﬁt-and-cut
is repeated, lowering the tolerance each time until it reaches 0.05
pixels. Note that this means that a single image must have, at the
last step, at least six members that are also in the reference image
in order to do this transformation; however, those 6 members do not
necessarily have to be shared with any of the other images. Requiring
a source to be in at least 90% of the images ensures some degree of
overlap while also budgeting for a variety of issues (e.g., interference
from cosmic rays) that would exclude a star from one of the catalogs.
There are multiple paths available for restricting or determining
stellar membership for a target to cut down the source list before
this step, each with its own advantages and shortfalls. For most well-
populated targets, the ﬁelds are considerably dense enough with
members that we are able to disregard membership at this step, with
non-member contributions to the image transformations being 𝜎-
clipped out with each iteration of our frame transformation. With this
approach, using cuts on 𝑞 (informed by ﬁgures such as Figure 1) does
very well to limit the transformation to stars that are target members.
For ‘nearby’ ﬁelds, using Gaia stars that are likely members of the
target may be a valid method to verify membership (e.g., identifying
members using GetGaia; del Pino et al. 2021, Martínez-García et al.
2021), but this will restrict the number of stars available for the
transformation. If multiple ﬁlters are available, you may also cut
membership based on color-magnitude diagram positions. However,
this may require more optimized photometry than is required for the
astrometric PM measurement.

The next step is to ﬁnd the individual PMs for the foreground Gaia
stars that we identiﬁed in the image. To do this, we ﬁnd the median
pixel position of a given foreground star in the ﬁrst and second epoch
and take the standard deviation of these positions as the uncertainty
for each epoch. A star’s total displacements in the north and east
directions then become, taking into account the ACS/WFC scaling
of 1 pixel = 50 mas,

The time baseline, Δ𝑇, is the time between the start of the ﬁrst
image exposure in the ﬁrst epoch and the ﬁrst image exposure in the
second epoch. These values 𝑑𝐸 and 𝑑𝑁, in mas/yr, are the addition
of the reﬂex motions of the target (which was transformed to be
the stationary frame of reference) and the star’s own PM (pmra
and pmdec from Gaia). The PM of the target (as indicated by an
individual foreground star) is therefore

𝜇∗

𝜇 𝛿 = −(𝑑𝑁 − pmdec).

the uncertainty in the (𝑋, 𝑌 ) transformation to the reference frame
(the standard deviation of a member’s coordinates in all images rel-
ative to the reference image), the uncertainty in the position of the
Gaia star in a given epoch, and the uncertainty on the Gaia pmra
and pmdec.

Finally, for targets with a large number of foreground sources, the
PM of the target is reported by ﬁnding the inverse-variance weighted
median of the individual (𝜇∗
𝛼, 𝜇 𝛿) results, which is found by sorting
the PMs along each axis, smallest-to-largest, and ﬁnding the ﬁrst PM
in this list, 𝜇[ 𝑗], for which

and then taking the weighted-mean PM over this boundary as the
median result. Lower and upper 68%-conﬁdence uncertainties are
then found using the same method, for which the left-hand side of
Equation 5 is ≥ 0.15865 and ≥ 0.84135, respectively. For ﬁelds
where we suspect a sub-sample of foreground stars to be under the
inﬂuence of large systematics or that lack an adequate number of
sources to calculate the weighted-median, we instead calculate the
weighted average.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Sculptor and Draco

Our results for the PMs for Sculptor and Draco are summarized in
Figures 2 and 3, respectively. In addition to the steps outlined in the
previous section, the ﬁnal foreground source lists for these objects
were iterated through a 3-𝜎 clip on 𝜇∗
𝛼 and 𝜇 𝛿. The main eﬀect of
this cut is to eliminate sources that were either mismatched between
HST and Gaia or that have low enough S/N such that they deviate
signiﬁcantly from the median. In these ﬁgures, we compare our per-
star and weighted-median values for the PMs to some of the values
found in the literature (Sohn et al. 2017 and Martínez-García et al.
2021). Sohn et al. (2017) used only background galaxies to measure
the PM of Sculptor and background galaxies and QSOs to measure
the PM of Draco. On the other hand, the PMs from Martínez-García
et al. (2021) are solely based on the average motions of these galaxies’
members found in Gaia eDR3.4

Within the three Draco ﬁelds, we matched a total of six QSOs
(three in F1, one in F2, and two in F3). Of these sources, we consider
all but one in F1, which was considerably faint, with low S/N in the
HST data, leaving us with ﬁve total (listed in Table 1). Including

The most dominant source of random uncertainty in our results
comes from the Gaia stellar PM data. Table 2 gives the mean size of
the various components of the per-star PM uncertainties for our target
ﬁelds. As it stands, being over an order-of-magnitude larger than the
next largest term, nearly all of the per-star scatter in the ﬁnal PM
results for Sculptor and Draco can be attributed to this component.
This will remain true until the mid-2020s, when the fourth Gaia data
release should reduce the size of these PM uncertainties by a factor
of ∼2.4 (mostly attributed to the longer time baseline; Lindegren
et al. 2021), bringing the magnitude of this term down to the size
of the uncertainty left over from the frame transformation. We can
also see that the second-epoch position scatter is signiﬁcantly larger
than the ﬁrst epoch. Though most of this uncertainty is tied to the
transformation – the residuals left behind while transforming the
frame of the second epoch into the ﬁrst – we also notice that the
second-epoch HST images have overall poorer PSF ﬁts than the ﬁrst
epoch. This is possibly due to the evolution of the ACS/WFC PSF
overtime, but could also be tied to various other technical issues,
such as tracking.

4.2 NGC 147 and NGC 185

Figure 4 and 5 summarize our results for the PMs of NGC 147 and
NGC 185, respectively, versus the values reported in Sohn et al.
(2020). The observations for both of these targets are similar in
that they consist of two epochs with long exposure times (∼1300
seconds), chosen both to get deep photometry of these distant galaxies
as well as to get good S/N for the background galaxies used to
calcualte PMs (Sohn et al. 2020). However, this also had the eﬀect of
saturating bright foreground stars on the detector; all of the stars with
Gaia data in these ﬁelds are at least one magnitude above the WFC
saturation threshold. Anderson (2022) shows that accurate positions
may be recoverable up to six magnitudes above the saturation limit
for ACS/WFC observations. However, their data does still show a
trending systematic oﬀset in the mean of the position of stars when
saturated versus unsaturated, with a large scatter. Therefore, it is not
obvious that the level of accuracy shown is adequate for what is
required for PM experiments.

For NGC 147, the failure of the astrometry for the brightest fore-
ground sources is obvious, with a large systematic oﬀset from the
literature value in 𝜇∗
𝛼. Although the scatter of the foreground reﬂex
motions for these sources is consistent with the Gaia PM uncertain-
ties, the implied PM from this result can be easily discarded as it in-

dicates a very large, unphysical tangential velocity given the distance
of NGC 147 (∼600 km/s). Restricting the sample to the fainter half of
stars (with instrumental magnitudes larger than −16.0), we are able
to exclude the stars most impacted by these systematics, recovering
a PM in agreement with the literature. However, this PM drags along
larger random uncertainty because, being characteristically fainter
than their brighter counterparts, these stars have signiﬁcantly larger

uncertainties associated with their Gaia stellar PMs. In addition, for
this smaller and more scattered sample, we must calculate the PM
using an inverse-variance weighted mean, as the median is no longer
operable under this domain.

For NGC 185, though done with very similar observations, we do
not see the same large, obvious systematic oﬀset that we observe for
NGC 147. However, we do see an obvious increase in the uncertain-

ties from the uncertainty on the HST positions of these stars – in
fact, for some of the brightest sources, the uncertainties on stellar
positions are of the same order as the uncertainties from Gaia.

4.3 Andromeda VII

Figure 6 shows a summary of our PM result for And VII. Sundry
properties of these data – namely, the obstacles concerning the HST
observations of this ﬁeld touched on in §2 – have the potential to
impugn our results. This includes that the ﬁrst epoch of data is in
a diﬀerent ﬁlter than the second (F555W versus F606W). However,
the ultimate quality of the PSF ﬁt seems to be acceptable for these
data. Though we can have some level of conﬁdence in our astrometric
reduction for each epoch, systematic eﬀects between the two epochs
due to this ﬁlter diﬀerence (and to the diﬀerences in pointing and
orientation) may remain.

The more troublesome aspect of the observations is that the
second-epoch observations have very long exposure times per-image
and, as a result, over half of the foreground Gaia stars (and, by
nature, the brightest stars with the lowest Gaia astrometric uncer-
tainties) are saturated. Though this poses less of an issue than it did
in the cases of NGC 147 and NGC 185, this still adds uncertainty
to our result, especially when considering potential biasing eﬀects
of diﬀering orientation angles between epochs. Though we do have
a handful of foreground stars that remain unsaturated in the second
epoch, restricting our calculations to only consider these stars does
not improve our uncertainties as we then run into the larger Gaia
uncertainties (as we also did when cutting the brightest stars for
NGC 147). In addition, though perhaps not fully saturated, we see
in Figure 1 that the brightest stars are approaching the saturation

threshold in the ﬁrst epoch, possibly aﬀecting our ability to centroid
these sources.

Regardless, because the uncertainties from Gaia are so dominant,
the increased random scatter associated with centroiding these bright
stars in the HST data may not have a great impact on what these stars
can tell us, and it is seems likely – especially when taking the NGC
147 and NGC 185 data into account – that the biasing eﬀect of
saturation is realized as a systematic contribution, if at all, on the
most saturated sources. Additionally, as none of the Gaia stars in the
And VII ﬁeld reach the instrumental magnitudes of the stars in the
NGC 147 or NGC 185 samples, we expect this systematic to have a
smaller contribution (based on Anderson 2022). Our ﬁnal PM values
for And VII are therefore:

4.4 Systematic errors

Until now, we have only considered – directly and indirectly – random
centroiding uncertainty that is caused by either photon noise or by
template versus real star mismatching. There are, however, other
sources of uncertainty. In particular, for Gaia, it is known that the
reference frame for motion is not truly zero and that this oﬀset varies
with sky position (Lindegren et al. 2021). The oﬀset displays spatial
correlation, being more alike for similar positions as characterized by
Lindegren et al. (2021) and improved for small scales in Equation 2
of Vasiliev & Baumgardt (2021). This systematic uncertainty vastly
dominates the total error of many satellites of the MW, especially

most of the classical ones, for which Gaia detects one thousand or
more stars. Often, random uncertainties as small as 0.01 mas/yr or
even smaller can be obtained; see, e.g., Battaglia et al. (2021). Using
the standard deviation in the position of our reference stars to get the
angular scale and calculate the systematic errors, we ﬁnd that, for
most targets, when only a single HST ﬁeld is used, the scale is about
0.014°; it increases for Sculptor to 0.1°. This is still small compared
to the systematic variation scale and thus this systematic error varies
only slightly between 0.0244 and 0.0261 mas/yr. Being larger than
the statistical error for many targets, this term, in principle, needs
to be considered as part of the error budget. Since the systematic
error decreases similarly to the statistical one between DR2 and
eDR3 (Lindegren et al. 2021), it is expected that the situation will be
similar in the future.

In principle, the HST data could also contribute, though less is
known about the systematic uncertainty of HST. At the very least,
HST’s systematics are small and in Sohn et al. (2012, 2013) there
is no evidence for systematic errors of relevant size. However, the
situation could be slightly diﬀerent for the QSO-based measurement
of Draco in Sohn et al. (2017) as, due to the rareness of QSOs, one
cannot apply local corrections as well as one could for background
galaxies.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Our results in §4 (also summarized in Table 3) suggest that using
foreground sources to measure the PMs of distant objects has much
promise. In particular, it is encouraging that we are able to recover
PMs for Sculptor and Draco that are in agreement with the literature,

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2022)

along with a new, physically-feasible motion for And VII. However,
our results for the M31 targets do force us a consider a few important
caveats:

(i) The most dominant source of uncertainty is from the Gaia
stellar PMs. Therefore, this method will work best for ﬁelds where
there are many foreground stars with pm_error (cid:46) 0.5, which should
correspond to foreground stars with 𝐺 (cid:46) 20. Regardless, plans for
future PM experiments should consider that the size of these uncer-
tainties should drop by a factor of about 2.4 (e.g., Lindegren et al.
2021) circa 2025 with Gaia DR4.

(ii) The main obstacle to using this method is the quality of the
HST astrometric reduction that is possible given the foreground stars
in a ﬁeld. For more distant targets (and perhaps fainter, nearby targets
such as UFDs), archival data tends to have longer exposure times,
meaning that foreground stars are more likely to be saturated on the
detector. For instance, though the the MW Cosmology Treasury Pro-
gram (HST GO-14734, PI: N. Kallivayalil; Kallivayalil et al. 2016)
observed 32 targets around the MW, these archival observations all
have per-image exposure times of ∼1200 seconds, chosen in order
to obtain deep photometry (e.g., as done by Sacchi et al. 2021 and
Richstein et al. 2022 with this data). Anderson (2022) shows – and we
were able to conﬁrm – that, for stars approaching and exceeding the
saturation threshold (at 𝑚 = −2.5 log (ﬂux) (cid:39) −14), the quality of
the astrometry that is possible quickly degrades. Though Anderson
(2022) suggests that accurate astrometry is possible up to around 6
magnitudes above the saturation threshold, we do not ﬁnd this to be
true for the precision required for PM studies.

Our suggestion is to aim for the Gaia stars in a target ﬁeld to have
instrumental magnitudes no more than ∼1.25 magnitudes above the

saturation threshold, i.e., 𝑚 (cid:38) −15.4; this approximately corresponds
to the instrumental magntiude of the brightest stars that we included
in our analysis of And VII. When planning new observations, then,
the exposure time at which half of the Gaia stars will be over this
limit (in the F606W ﬁlter) can roughly be estimated as:

𝑡exp ≈ 1000 s · 100.4( (cid:101)𝐺−18.3) ,

(10)

where (cid:101)𝐺 is the median 𝐺-band magnitude of Gaia stars in the target
ﬁeld.

Along with its application with existing HST data, the future of
space-based observatories looks promising to keep this method as an
eﬃcacious tool moving forward. The method we have presented in
this paper for recovering novel PMs is well positioned to be consid-
ered for new second-epoch follow-ups to existing HST observations,
as it does not ask for deep-photometry/long-exposure ﬁrst-epoch ob-
servations (rather, it may ﬂourish with the obverse).

In fact – with proper foresight – the future should be promising
for PM experiments generally. Even assuming a pessimistic outlook
for HST’s lifespan, the James Webb Space Telescope and the Nancy
Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST) should ensure our ability
to execute second-epoch observations well into the 2030s. It is also
exciting to consider – with its planned 2027 launch – that the combi-
nation of NGRST’s large ﬁeld-of-view (∼100 times larger than HST’s
ACS/WFC, proportionally allowing for ∼100 times more foreground
stars per target ﬁeld) and the improved uncertainties from future Gaia
data releases has the potential to substantially improve the precision
with which we can measure systemic PMs.
