Generation of Patient-specific Structured 
Hexahedral Mesh of Aortic Aneurysm Wall

Abstract   Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement in the lower part 
of the main artery “Aorta” by 1.5 times its normal diameter. AAA can cause death 
if rupture occurs. Elective surgeries are recommended to prevent rupture based on 
geometrical measurements of AAA diameter and diameter growth rate. Reliability 
of these geometric parameters to predict the AAA rupture risk has been questioned, 
and biomechanical assessment has been proposed to distinguish between patients 
with high and low risk of rupture. Stress in aneurysm wall is the main variable of 
interest  in  such  assessment.  Most  studies  use  finite  element  method  to  compute 
AAA  stress.  This  requires  discretising  patient-specific  geometry  (aneurysm  wall 
and intraluminal thrombus ILT) into finite elements/meshes. Tetrahedral elements 
are most commonly used as they can be generated in seemingly automated and ef-
fortless way. In practice, however, due to complex aneurysm geometry, the process 
tends to require time consuming mesh optimisation to ensure sufficiently high qual-
ity  of  tetrahedral  elements.  Furthermore,  ensuring  solution  convergence  requires 
large number of tetrahedral elements, which leads to long computation times. In this 
study, we focus on generation of hexahedral meshes as they are known to provide 
converged  solution  for  smaller  number  of  elements  than  tetrahedral  meshes.  We 
limit  our  investigation  to  already  existing  algorithms  and  software  packages  for 
mesh generation. Generation of hexahedral meshes for continua with complex/ir-
regular  geometry,  such  as  aneurysms,  requires  analyst  interaction.  We  propose  a 
procedure for generating high quality patient-specific hexahedral discretisation of 
aneurysm wall using the algorithms available in commercial software package for 
mesh generation. For aneurysm cases, we demonstrate that the procedure facilitates 
patient-specific  mesh  generation  within  timeframe  consistent  with  clinical  work-
flow  constraints  while  requiring  only  limited  input  from  the  analyst.  As  a  future 
aspect,  the  methodology  used in this article can be automated with  minimal user 
interaction, and further to develop a robust algorithm for structured mesh generation 
in aneurysm wall.

Introduction 

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a chronic vascular disease of elderly men 
(over 65 years old), while women has less chance by 4-6 times in same age group 
[1]. It is a permanent and irreversible enlargement in the lower part of the aorta [2], 
the main artery that pumps blood from the heart to the rest of human body. AAA is 
usually diagnosed incidentally by unrelated follow-up or examination as it is symp-
tomless disease [3]. The most fatal event of AAA is rupture, where mortality rate 
can  reach  up  to  90%  [4]  leading  to  200,000  deaths  annually  worldwide  [5]  and 
around 1,500 deaths yearly in Australia and the Oceania region [6]. 

According to current AAA management, patients undergo  elective surgical in-
tervention if their maximum aortic diameter  is more than 55 mm for men and 50 
mm  for  women  [7,  8],  while  below  these  recommended  thresholds  patients  are 
placed on surveillance program that  monitors the aneurysm growth rate. The sur-
gery is recommended if growth rate exceeds 10 mm/year. Australia has a high rate 
of AAA repairs below these recommended thresholds compared to other Western 
countries. However, the probability for aneurysms with aortic diameter of 40 – 50 
mm under surveillance to rupture is only 0.4% per year, which is lower than the risk 
of death due to the postoperative complications [3].    

This raises the question of how to best manage AAAs as there is a balance be-
tween interventions to prevent AAA rupture versus overtreatment that may cause 
harm to patients and incur non-essential medical cost. Over the last 25 years, re-
searchers introduced different AAA biomechanical rupture risk indicators or indices 
to identify patients at high risk of AAA rupture [9-13] and conversely those at low 
risk for whom surgical intervention can be avoided. Aneurysm wall stress calcula-
tion is the main non-invasive biomechanical assessment used for these rupture in-
dices, in addition to population-based strength statistical models used for some of 
rupture indices [9]. Evaluation of  such indices is beyond the scope of this study. 
Finite element method is widely used for AAA stress calculations that requires dis-
cretising patient-specific geometry (aneurysm wall and intraluminal thrombus ILT) 
into finite elements/meshes as a part of creating the finite element model.  

Tetrahedral  mesh  generation  for  patient-specific  AAA  geometries  is  used  in 
computational biomechanical analysis as it is believed it can be created automati-
cally with high element quality without expertise in computational grid generation 
[13, 14]. In a study done by Miller et al. [15], AAA (aneurysm wall and ILT) finite 
element models contained more than 1 million tetrahedral elements. This high num-
ber of elements ensures convergent solution, but tends to result in relatively long 
computational times. Furthermore, automated elimination of low quality tetrahedral  
elements typically requires application of mesh optimisation procedures. From our 
experience,  presence  of  even  small  number  of  low  quality  elements  may  lead  to 
unreasonably long optimisation times (up to around 40 – 50 minutes of a personal 
computer  with  Intel  quad-core  i7  processs).  Therefore,  we  focus  on  hexahedral 
meshes as they require smaller number of elements than tetrahedral meshes [16]. 
For aneurysm walls discretised using 30,000 to 50,000 hexahedral elements, around 
500,000 tetrahedral elements were needed to achieve similar geometric discreitsa-
tion accuracy [17].

[18-20]  using 

Generation of high quality structured (mapped) hexahedral finite element meshes 
of  healthy  blood  vessel  walls  can  be  done  automatically  by  defining  the  vessels 
centerlines 
freely  available  software  such  as  pyFormex 
(https://github.com/dladd/pyFormex)  and  Gmsh  (https://gmsh.info/).  This,  how-
ever, does not extent to complex/irregular geometry of AAAs. Generation of struc-
tured hexahedral meshes of AAAs tends to require expert’s knowledge of finite el-
ement meshing procedures and substantial manual effort of the analyst. Specialised 
mesh generation code developed by Tarjuelo-Gutierrez et al. [21] facilitates con-
struction of hexahedral meshes for aneurysm wall and thrombus including the bi-
furcations. It relies on connecting the extracted axial and longitudinal lines in the 
aneurysm from the manual MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) segmentation and 
the calculated aneurysm centerline. Need for substantial effort of the analyst was 
also reported in the studies using well established commercial mesh generators.  Ap-
plication of CEM CFD 14.5 (Ansys Inc., USA) to create patient-pecific hexahedral 
finite element meshes of aneurysm wall required 4 – 8 hours of analyst’s work  per 
case  [12,  22].  Mayr  et  al.  [23]  used  CUBIT  mesh  generator  (https://cubit.san-
dia.gov/) to create  hexahedral elements for aortic aneurysms  to be  used in  fluid-
structure interaction simulation. Distinct advantage of CUBIT that it can automati-
cally partition complex geometries into mappable volumes to build structured hex-
ahedral mesh.  CUBIT is available for US government use only. However, its com-
(https://coreform.com/products/coreform-
mercial  version,  Coreform  Cubit 
cubit/free-meshing-software/),  has  no  such  restriction.  A4Clinics  Vascops 
(http://www.vascops.com/en/vascops-A4clinics.html) software to biomechanically 
analyse AAA rupture risk creates a hexahedral aneurysm wall with a minimal user 
interaction. Their meshing algorithm limits any mesh refinement along the circum-
ferential and axial directions  of aneurysm  wall and ILT,  which creates one layer 
through wall thickness and coarse elements for thick ILT [24]. However, in several 
studies it has been argued that at least two elements across the AAA wall thickness 
is needed for convergred solution in terms of stress computation [25] . Y. Zhang et 
al. [16, 26] have successfully created unstructured hexahedral meshes from volu-
metric data (medical images as an example) to be used in FEA. Automated unstruc-
tured  hexahedral  elements  for  aneurysm  wall  and  ILT  using  Harpoon 
(http://www.sharc.co.uk/index.htm) was done by Maier et al. [27].  Our experience 
indicates that unstructured hexahedral meshes may contain some poor quality ele-
ments, in particular elements with very poor (close to zero or even negative) Jaco-
bian quality measure. 

In this article, we demonstrate a procedure to create a high quality patient-spe-
cific  structured hexahedral  mesh of aortic aneurysm  wall  models  using commer-
cially available mesh generators for stress computation in the aneurysam wall. We 
use tetrahedral elements for the intraluminal thrombus (ILT) because of its complex 
geometry. In addition, accurate ILT stress analysis is not a variable of interest as an 
indicator of AAA rupture risk, and hence we use tetrahedral elements.

2  Methods 

2.1  Patient’s data and patient-specific AAA geometry 

A contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CTA) image data-set 
of four abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients with an average maximum aortic 
diameter of 55 mm (standard deviation = 9 mm) were used to demonstrate the mesh-
ing techniques proposed and used in this work. The CTA images were acquired at 
Fiona Stanley Hospital (Murdoch, Western Australia, Australia) using SOMATOM 
Definition  Flash  CT  Scanner  (Siemens  Healthineers  AG,  Forchheim,  Germany). 
The spatial resolution (voxel size) of the CTA images is 0.625x0.625x1.5 mm3. Pa-
tient’s  gave  their  informed  consent  before  acquiring  the  images  according  to  the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  

the  open-source  medical 

The patient-specific AAA geometries were segmented from the CTA images us-
ing 
analysis  package,  3D  Slicer 
image 
(https://www.slicer.org/) [28]. The contrast-enhanced images allowed an automated 
segmentation  for  the  lumen  (blood  channel)  using  the  threshold  algorithm  in  the 
segmentation module. The Aneurysm (wall and the intraluminal thrombus ‘ILT’) 
needed some manual work to distinguish between the aneurysm and surrounding 
tissues. Figure 1 shows the segmented patient-specific AAA geometry for a selected 
case (Patient 1), the blue geometry is the aneurysm wall and the red geometry is the 
ILT. We assumed constant wall thickness of 1.5 mm for the aneurysm wall, as there 
is no reliable method to accurately determine AAA wall thickness from CTAs only 
has developed yet [29].

2.2.1 Patient-specific AAA meshes 

Different meshing tools and algorithms can be used to generate hexahedral ele-
ments for the aneurysm wall, we mentioned some of them in the introduction. We 
tried a simple in-house MATLAB code that creates the aneurysm topology using 
the aortic centreline and maximum distances from this centreline to the aortic wall. 
This algorithm defines subdivided circles and ellipses orthogonal to the centreline 
ready to be connected using splines to form surface quadrilateral meshes. We faced 
two main issues in this early-stage code, (1) these circles and ellipses may overlap 
in the locations that have big change in wall curvature, and (2) a smoothing tech-
nique (Laplace smoothing as an example [30]) should be used to improve the ele-
ments shape and mesh quality.      

Fully automated hexahedral meshing was not possible for the aneurysm wall us-
ing available open-source and commercial mesh generators because of its irregular 
and asymmetrical shape. We used the mesh generator available  in ABAQUS/CAE 
(https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/)  finite  elemen 
pre-processor.  It provides high quality element generation although it strongly re-
lies    on  user’s  expertise  and  requires  substantial  input  (manual  mesh  generation 
work) from the user.. The geometry needs to be subdivided into many partitions in 
order to create the structured hexahedral mesh. We used the commercial mesh gen-
eration software Altair HyperMesh (https://www.altair.com/hypermesh) to create a 
high quality hexahedral aneurysm wall  models, as the ISML (Intelligent Systems 
for Medicine Laboratory) team has many years of experience in using it, and it is a 
powerful  finite  element  meshing  tool  that  generates  high  quality  elements  from 
CAD (Computer-aided design) or image-based geometries. It should be noted that 
any mesh generator can be used. In the following text we describe the procedure 
used in HyperMesh to create the meshes. 

We imported patient-specific  geometry of  AAA  wall  extracted from the CTA 
images previously in STL format (Stereo Lithography file format). Because of the 
irregular geometry of AAA, the geometry should be partitioned to create the struc-
tured (mapped meshing) hexahedral mesh. Figure 2 shows the four aneurysm wall 
geometries meshed in this study.

(from three sides).  

The 3D hexahedral mesh (Figure 3a) was created by sweeping the 2D meshed 
ring (Figure 3b) along the aneurysm wall. The created 2D top ring of quadrilateral 
elements in the aneurysm wall defines the element size and number of hexahedral 
layers through wall thickness. We used two elements through wall thickness with 
an element size of 0.75 mm.

We created tetrahedral elements for the aneurysm intraluminal thrombus (ILT) 
using HyperMesh because of its complex shape. The transition between the quadri-
lateral  surface  meshes  to  tetrahedral  volume  meshes  was  important  to  create  the 
shared conformal surface between the hexahedral aneurysm wall and the tetrahedral 
ILT (Figure 4a). We used the inner’s wall surface topology (nodes location) gener-
ated previously to create the outer surface of the ILT (triangular elements). We im-
ported the inner surface of the ILT (the surface of the lumen ‘blood channel’ seg-
mented in 3D Slicer earlier) and created a dummy mesh to close the top and bottom 
caps of the ILT (Figure 4b).

view of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) showing the wall in red and ILT in blue, (b) 2D top 
cap created (green) to close the volume of ILT and generate the tetrahedral volume mesh. 

As the ILT volume is closed, a tetrahedral automated mesh filled this empty vol-
ume, allowing the algorithm to reduce number of elements inside ILT, and hence 
the computation time in the finite element solution is minimised. We kept the exist-
ing nodes/locations for both surfaces of wall and ILT, and allowed the splitting of 
quadrilaterals into triangles to avoid the creation pyramid elements. The upper and 
lower caps created (dummy mesh) we set them as freely adjusted nodes. A section 
view of the tetrahedral ILT created is shown in Figure 5.

2.2.2 Element quality  

For hexahedral elements, we used two measures to check elements quality: (1) 
normalised/scaled Jacobian quality measure [26, 31], a Jacobian value of 0.6 and 
higher is recommended [32], and (2) the minimum and maximum allowable interior 

 
 
 
 
 
8  

angles of a quadrilateral face, the suggested limits are between 45 and 135 degrees 
[32]. Both measures are important as we found that some elements have high Jaco-
bian with maximum or minimum interior angles that are out of the recommended 
range. Figure 6 shows and describes an example of low quality element. From our 
experience, we confirmed that more partitions or sections in the geometry can solve 
such problem. Additionally, decreasing the element size may also eliminate the cre-
ation of low quality elements.  

Fig. 6 Example of low quality hexahedral element with Jacobian of 0.95, but with minimum inte-
rior angle of 39.25° and maximum interior angle of 141.36° that are out of the recommended al-
lowable angles (45° - 135°) [32].  

We checked the tetrahedral elements quality using two measures: (1) maximum 
and minimum allowable interior angle for triangles, and (2) the volumetric skew. 
The  recommended  interior  angles  ranges  between  30  and  120  degrees  [32].  The 
volumetric skew is 1 minus the ratio of the actual tetrahedron volume to an equilat-
eral  tetrahedron  volume  of  same  circumradius  (circumradius  is  the  radius  of  a 
sphere passing through the four vertices of the tetrahedron). A value of 1 means a 
flat tetrahedral element as seen in Figure 7. We found that all poor quality elements 
are located at the top or bottom edges of the ILT which are areas of no interest.  

Fig. 7  Two  views  showing  a  bad  quality  tetrahedral  element  with  volumetric  skew  of  1  which 
means a flat tetrahedral element. 

2.3  Stress computation in AAA wall 

We used linear static finite element analysis implemented in ABAQUS/Standard 
finite  element  code  [33]  (https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/prod-
ucts/abaqus/) to calculate the aneurysm wall stress, based on the previous study by 
Joldes et al. [34] that compared direct non-linear and inverse non-linear finite ele-
ment procedures [35, 36] with their elastic linear approach, they concluded that the 
deformed AAA geometry and patient’s blood pressure are the only inputs needed 
for acceptable AAA stress calculations. Furthermore, their study showed that stress 
calculation in AAA is independent of material properties of aortic tissue, as stress 

 
 
 
 
 
9 

is calculated by balancing the internal forces of the aorta with the applied pressure 
(patient’s blood pressure) [13, 34, 37]. 

We defined an incompressible linear material model for the aneurysm wall, while 
the aneurysm ILT incompressible linear material model was more compliant by 20 
times. We used the hybrid 20-noded quadratic element C3D20RH for the hexahe-
dral elements, this reduced integration element has 8 integration points, and the hy-
brid 10-noded quadratic element C3D10H for the tetrahedral elements. The hybrid 
formulation prevents volumetric locking for these nearly incompressible materials.  
The  aneurysm  was  uniformly  loaded  at  the  internal  surface  of  the  ILT by  the 
patient-specific blood pressure measured 5 minutes before acquiring the scan. We 
used mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) that is calculated from the systolic and 
diastolic pressures (MAP = 1/3 systolic pressure + 2/3 diastolic pressure). The an-
eurysm was fully supported at its top and bottom edges. 

We  analysed  the  maximum  principal  stress  of  the  patient-specific  aneurysm 
walls as it represent the internal forces that balance the blood pressure in the blood 
vessel [13]. The residual stresses of the aorta were not taken into account in this 
study, as we focus on the method of generating high quality hexahedral meshes for 
aneurysm wall rather than the AAA rupture assessment through stress computation. 
We compared the stress results of hexahedral walls with finite element models of 
same patients that contained tetrahedral meshes for the aneurysm walls. The tetra-
hedral  models  were  created  using  Gmsh  used  within  from  BioPARR  (https://bi-
oparr.mech.uwa.edu.au/)  and  stress  calculations  using  ABAQUS/Standard.  Bi-
oPARR is freely-available open-source software for utilising finite element method 
for AAA stress computation [13]. In addition to maximum principal stress, we an-
alyse the 99th percentile of maximum principal stress in aneurysm wall [38] to elim-
inate any artefacts and uncertainties created during AAA geometry segmentation or 
generation of the computational grids. 

3  Results 

3.1  Convergence suggests non-linear analysis   

We performed a mesh convergence study on one of the analysed AAAs (Patient 
1) to ensure that computation of stress in aneurysm wall is independent of mesh size 
while  reducing  computational  time.  We  created  three  hexahedral  aneurysm  wall 
models.  The  first  model  included  2  layers  of  hexahedral  elements  through  wall 
thickness, the second model had 3 layers while the third model had 4 layers. We 
three  models  using 
calculated 
ABAQUS/Standard on Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5930K CPU @ 3.50 GHz with 64.0 
GB of RAM  running Windows 8 OS. The finite element  models did not include 

the  maximum  principal  stress 

those 

in

ILT. The inner surface of the hexahedral wall was loaded with 12 kPa (MAP, mean 
arterial pressure).  

Table  1  summarises  the  mesh  characteristics  of  each  studied  finite  element 
model. It also includes the peak and 99th percentile values of maximum principal 
stress for the three models. The peak stress values usually occur at the fixed nodes 
of the top and bottom edges of the aneurysm wall, thus we compared 99th percentile 
of stress.

We also selected four nodes in the three aneurysm wall models to compare their

eurysm wall, two of them were on the outer surface of the wall and two on the inner 
surface. The four nodes had the exact location/coordinates for the three studied an-
eurysm walls. Figure 8 shows the convergence of the 4 selected nodes.

measures used, Jacobian and minimum/maximum interior allowable angles for hex-

ILT are located at the top and bottom edges of the aneurysm, where it is fully sup-
ported, and form very small number compared to the total number of ILT elements 
in AAA  which does not exceed 0.02% of the total elements number in the AAA 
model.

3.3  Aneurysm wall stress 

We extracted the maximum principal stress for the analysed case, as aneurysms 
will experience that highest stresses in the tangential direction which is consistent 
with the pressure vessel theory [39], Figure 10 shows the maximum principal stress 
contour plots. Table 3 compares the results of the peak and 99th percentile of maxi-
mum principal stress for the hexahedral meshes of aneurysm walls with results of 
tetrahedral meshes of aneurysm walls which include much larger number of nodes 
and  elements  (more  than  1  million  elements  for  an  aneurysm  [15])  for  the  same 
studied patients. Absolute differences showed that the results between the two com-
putational grids are very close. The finite element models computation time for both 
grids is reported using Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5930K CPU @ 3.50 GHz with 64.0 
GB of RAM running Windows 8 OS, a significant time reduction is observed in the 
hexahedral meshes models.

4  Discussion 

Hexahedral meshing of aneurysm wall is not a trivial and straightforward prob-
lem. In this study, we present a technique to mesh the aneurysm wall using hexahe-
dral elements using a commercial mesh generator, HyperMesh. The steps followed 
in this technique to get a high quality hexahedral meshes took 20 – 30 minutes of 
manual work for each case.  For future, these steps can be scripted using the lan-
guage used by HyperMesh with minimum user-intervention. Low quality hexahe-
dral elements could not be completely avoided (see Table 2, Patients 3 and 4) be-
cause of complex and irregular geometries of AAAs. Despite the fact that number 
of low quality elements did not exceed 0.2% of the total number of hexahedral ele-
ments in the  patient-specific  AAA  model. From our experience  mesh refinement 
would improve elements quality but will increase computational time with negligi-
ble change in results (2 hexahedral elements through wall thickness are sufficient

for converged solution). As the key point in biomechanical analysis is to have an 
acceptable solution in reasonable time rather than optimal solution [32].  

The  created  hexahedral  meshes  of  aneurysm  wall  using  ABAQUS/CAE  (see 
2.2.1) had high quality elements with minimum Jacobian ratio of 0.71. Although 
from Figure 11 the mesh density mismatch was obvious because of the inflexibility 
of defining partition planes in ABAQUS/CAE. Maximum principal stress contour 
plots showed very good match between the model created by ABAQUS/CAE mesh-
ing tool and the model created by HyperMesh, and the absolute difference of the 
peak value of maximum principal stress was 0.0479 MPa. HyperMesh was preferred 
on ABAQUS/CAE meshing tool as it requires less partitioning plans for mapped 
hexahedral meshes.
