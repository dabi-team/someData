ABSTRACT

We present detailed elemental abundances and radial velocities of stars in the metal-poor globular cluster (GC) NGC 2298, based on
near-infrared high-resolution (R ∼ 22,500) spectra of 12 members obtained during the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2) at Las Campanas Observatory as part of the seventeenth Data Release (DR 17) of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). We employed the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accuracy Spectra
(BACCHUS) software to investigate abundances for a variety of species including α elements (Mg, Si, and Ca), the odd-Z element Al,
and iron-peak elements (Fe and Ni) located in the innermost regions of NGC 2298. We ﬁnd a mean and median metallicity [Fe/H]
= −1.76 and −1.75, respectively, with a star-to-star spread of 0.14 dex, which is compatible with the internal measurement errors.
Thus, we ﬁnd no evidence for an intrinsic [Fe/H] abundance spread in NGC 2298. The typical α−element enrichment in NGC 2298
is overabundant relative to the Sun, and it follows the trend of other metal-poor GCs. We conﬁrm the existence of an Al-enhanced
population in this cluster, which is clearly anti-correlated with Mg, indicating the prevalence of the multiple-population phenomenon
in NGC 2298.

1. Introduction

Globular clusters (GCs) are important
long-lived time cap-
sules that provide information about the primordial evolution-
ary stages of their host galaxies. For several decades, GC stars
have been known to display a zoo of peculiarities, such as light-
element (Carretta et al. 2009b; Pancino et al. 2017; Schiavon
et al. 2017; Masseron et al. 2019; Mészáros et al. 2020, 2021;
Geisler et al. 2021, and references therein) and heavy-element
(Carretta & Bragaglia 2021; Marino et al. 2021; Fernández-
Trincado et al. 2022, 2021a) abundance variations over a wide
range of metallicities, which have been attributed to the multiple-
populations (MPs) phenomenon (for a thorough review, see Bas-
tian & Lardo 2018).

The southern cluster NGC 2298, located in the constella-
tion Puppis, has long been recognized to be among the most
metal-poor GCs in the Milky Way (MW) (Hesser & Shawl 1985;
McWilliam et al. 1992). However, the metallicity estimates re-

ported for this object have covered a range from [Fe/H]= −1.96
to −1.71 (see e.g., Frogel et al. 1983; Cohen 1983; Zinn & West
1984; Zinn 1985; McWilliam et al. 1992; Geisler et al. 1995;
Salaris & Cassisi 1996; Carretta & Gratton 1997; Kraft & Ivans
2003; Pritzl et al. 2005; Carretta et al. 2009a; Carrera et al. 2013;
Roediger et al. 2014; Yong et al. 2014), creating some uncer-
tainty regarding its status as one of the most metal-poor systems.
This cluster is also well known for its lack of a clear indication of
MPs along the main sequence (MS) (Piotto et al. 2015), as well
as likely along the horizontal branch (HB) population (Rani et al.
2021), in near-UV/optical color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs).
However, its red-giant branch (RGB) displays clear evidence for
both ﬁrst- and second-generation stars (e.g., Milone et al. 2017).

NGC 2298 is a particularly interesting GC, as its origin and
nature still remains controversial. For instance, some studies
have proposed that it is likely associated with the Monoceros
progenitor galaxy (Crane et al. 2003; Martin et al. 2004; Forbes
& Bridges 2010); however, more recent studies conducted by
Massari et al. (2019) and Malhan et al. (2022) have linked this
GC to the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus merger (Belokurov et al.
2018; Helmi et al. 2018). A few previous and more recent studies

have also suggested the presence of extra-tidal features around
NGC 2298 (Leon et al. 2000; Balbinot et al. 2011; Carballo-
Bello et al. 2018; Piatti & Carballo-Bello 2020; Sollima 2020;
Ibata et al. 2021); however, their existence has been questioned
based on more recent investigations of deep imaging from the
Dark Energy Camera (Zhang et al. 2022).

While NGC 2298 has been widely studied photometrically
(in the optical and UV), detailed spectroscopic information about
it remains sparse. Furthermore, spectroscopic evidence for the
existence of multiple stellar populations in this GC has not been
reported in the literature yet. Located at 15.1 kpc (Baumgardt &
Vasiliev 2021) from the Galactic center, it is an old (∼ 12 − −13
Gyr; Monty et al. 2018) GC that lies in a region of relatively
low foreground interstellar reddening, with E(B−V) ∼ 0.14 –
0.16 (Kraft & Ivans 2003; Piotto et al. 2015; Monty et al. 2018),
making it an excellent candidate for the study of MPs in GCs at a
low Galactic latitude (b ∼ −16◦). In the present work, we report
the ﬁrst high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectral study of
elemental-abundance estimates for a variety of chemical species
for a sample of 12 sources in the innermost regions of NGC 2298
and we characterize its chemical composition. For the ﬁrst time,
we report information on the main element families, namely the
α elements (Mg, Si, Ca), the odd-Z element Al, and the Fe-peak
elements (Fe and Ni).

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes
the data, and Section 3 describes the identiﬁed cluster members.
Sections 4 and 5 describe the derivation of atmospheric param-
eters and elemental abundances for the individual stars. Section
6 presents our abundance analysis, and Section 7 provides our
concluding remarks.

2. Data

The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment II
survey (APOGEE-2; Majewski et al. 2017) is one of the internal
programs of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV (SDSS-IV; Blan-
ton et al. 2017). It was developed to provide precise radial veloc-
ities (RV errors < 1 km s−1) and detailed chemical abundances
for an unprecedented large sample of giant stars, aiming to unveil
the dynamical structure and chemical history across the entire
MW. The APOGEE-2 instruments (capable of observing up to
300 objects simultaneously) are high-resolution (R ∼ 22, 500),
NIR spectrographs (Wilson et al. 2019) observing all the com-
ponents of the MW (halo, disk, and bulge) from the Northern
Hemisphere on the 2.5m telescope at the Apache Point Obser-
vatory (APO, APOGEE-2N; Gunn et al. 2006) and the South-
ern Hemisphere on the Irénée du Pont 2.5m telescope at the Las
Campanas Observatory (LCO, APOGEE-2S; Bowen & Vaughan
1973). Each instrument records most of the H band (1.51µm –
1.69µm) on three detectors, with coverage gaps between ∼1.58–
1.59µm and ∼1.64–1.65µm, and with each ﬁber subtending a
∼2” diameter on-sky ﬁeld of view in the northern instrument and
1.3” one in the southern instrument.

DR 17 (Abdurro’uf et al. 2022) is the ﬁnal release of the
APOGEE-2 survey from SDSS-IV. It includes all APOGEE-2
data taken at APO through November 2020 and at LCO through
January 2021. The dual APOGEE-2 instruments have observed
more than 700,000 stars throughout the MW. We refer the reader
to Zasowski et al. (2017), Beaton et al. (2021), and Santana et al.
(2021) for further details regarding the targeting strategy of the
APOGEE-2 survey.

Spectra for this project were reduced as described in Nidever
et al. (2015); they were also analyzed using the APOGEE Stellar

Parameters and Chemical Abundance Pipeline (ASPCAP; Gar-
cía Pérez et al. 2016), and the libraries of synthetic spectra de-
scribed in Zamora et al. (2015). The accuracy and precision of
the atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances are exten-
sively analyzed in Holtzman et al. (2018), Jönsson et al. (2018),
and Jönsson et al. (2020), while details regarding the custom
H-band line list are fully described in Shetrone et al. (2015),
Hasselquist et al. (2016), Cunha et al. (2017), and Smith et al.
(2021).

3. Sample

The metal-poor GC NGC 2298 was included in the targeting
strategy of the APOGEE-2S program at the end of the survey.
Here we analyze for the ﬁrst time the APOGEE-2S spectra for
potential members of NGC 2298 – centered on α = 06:48:59.41
and δ = −36:00:19.1 – observed from LCO by the APOGEE-2S
survey in January 2021.

The APOGEE-2S plug-plates (PlateID = 12836 and 12837),
containing the NGC 2298 ﬁeld (LocID = 7253), are centered
on (α, δ) ∼ (102.35549◦, −36.0852◦) and contain 365 science
ﬁbers. From these, 12 stars lie very close to the cluster center,
which is well within the tidal radius (rt (cid:46) 26.12 arcmin)1 at d(cid:12) =
9.83±0.17 kpc (Baumgardt & Vasiliev 2021), as shown in Figure
1.

Figure 2 shows that the 12 sources analyzed in this work
share common properties making them very likely NGC 2298
members, that is to say their position along the main branches of
the cluster CMD in the Gaia EDR3 bands; nominal Gaia EDR3
proper motions, (µα cos δ; µδ) = (3.320±0.025; −2.175 ± 0.026)
mas yr−1; radial velocity, RV= 147.15 ± 0.57 km s−1 (Vasiliev
& Baumgardt 2021); and metallicity. The same ﬁgure (left and
middle panel) also shows the membership probability provided
by Vasiliev & Baumgardt (2021) for the NGC 2298 ﬁeld. The 12
target stars occupy the region of the CMD dominated by high-
est likelihood cluster stars on the red giant branch (RGB) and
asymptotic giant branch (AGB).

The APOGEE-2S spectra used in this work have a typical
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) larger than 109 pixel−1, which was
reached from two (ten stars) and four (two stars) ﬁeld visits,
making these spectra ideal to obtain reliable elemental abun-
dances for several chemical species accessible from the H band
in the metal-poor regime. Additionally, we ﬁnd the typical radial
velocity scatter (VSCATTER) to be less than 0.3 km s−1 for all
sources in our sample, with no strong evidence for radial velocity
variations that might aﬀect the resulting elemental abundances.
Figure 2 also shows the radial velocity against the metallic-
ity for the 365 sources surveyed by APOGEE-2S in the region
of this GC. ASPCAP–[Fe/H] determinations are highlighted by
gray open symbols, while the BACCHUS–[Fe/H] ones (see Sec-
tion 5) are marked with navy blue symbols. This ﬁgure reveals
that BACCHUS–[Fe/H] is systematically oﬀset by roughly 0.1 dex
to higher metallicity compared to the ASPCAP–[Fe/H] abundance
ratio, which is most likely due to systematics between BACCHUS
and ASPCAP, similar to other studies of the APOGEE-2 spectra
(see, e.g., Masseron et al. 2019; Fernández-Trincado et al. 2020;
Mészáros et al. 2020).

(Gustafsson et al. 2008), and following the same technique as
described in several APOGEE-2 works (see, e.g., Fernández-
Trincado et al. 2021b, 2019, for instance), and summarized here
for guidance. With the atmospheric parameters determined in
Section 4, the ﬁrst step consisted of determining the metallic-
ity from selected Fe I lines, the micro-turbulence velocity (ξt),
and the convolution parameter. Other chemical species not re-
ported in this work were found to have very weak lines and/or
were too heavily blended by telluric features to provide reliable
abundances.

in the format YYYYMMDD. This was used to ﬁnd the local con-
tinuum level via a linear ﬁt. (b) We then performed cosmic ray
and telluric line rejections, before (c) estimating the local S/N.
(d) We automatically selected a series of ﬂux points contributing
to a given absorption line, and then (e) we derived abundances
by comparing the observed spectrum with a set of convolved
synthetic spectra characterized by diﬀerent abundances. Subse-
quently, four diﬀerent abundance determination methods were
used: (1) line-proﬁle ﬁtting; (2) core line-intensity comparison;
(3) global goodness-of-ﬁt estimate; and (4) an equivalent-width
comparison. Each diagnostic yields validation ﬂags. Based on
these ﬂags, a decision tree then rejects or accepts each estimate,
keeping the best-ﬁt abundance. We adopted the ξ2 diagnostic for
the abundance choice because of its robustness. However, we
stored the information from the other diagnostics, including the
standard deviation between all four methods.

6. Elemental abundances

The present study substantially contributes to the chemical char-
acterisation of the metal-poor GC NGC 2298. Our sample of
12 cluster members allows us to investigate any intra-cluster
abundance variations. Figure 3 summarizes the resulting elemen-
tal abundances for six chemical species, including α elements
(Mg, Si, and Ca), the odd-Z element Al, and iron-peak elements
(Fe and Ni) that were investigated from APOGEE-2S spectra
for the 12 stars in the innermost region of NGC 2298. Table
A.1 contains the abundance values for [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Si/Fe],
[Ca/Fe], [Fe/H], and [Ni/Fe] derived by the BACCHUS code scaled
to the Solar reference value from Asplund et al. (2005).

We remark that no conclusive answers can be drawn for C,
N, and O from 12C14N, 16OH, and 12C16O, as these lines become
too weak to be detected or accurately measured at the metallicity
and temperature range of our NGC 2298 stars. For this reason,
we choose not to speculate on the interpretation of C, N, and O
abundances for the present sample.

Overall, the results for NGC 2298 are in reasonable agree-
ment with other GCs of a similar metallicity for almost all
species. However, NGC 2298 exhibits median values for [N/Fe]
and [Mg/Fe] which are slightly lower than M 53, M 55, and
NGC 6397 (Mészáros et al. 2020), suggesting a likely diﬀerent
chemical-enrichment history and/or distinct birth conditions.

Figure 4 demonstrates a lack of abundance dependence on
the eﬀective temperature or surface gravity, as well as on the
evolutionary status (RGB or AGB) for Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe, or Ni
at the metallicity of NGC 2298.

cmin at d(cid:12) =9.83±0.17 kpc (Baumgardt & Vasiliev 2021). The image is
oriented with the east pointing to the right and north pointing up.

4. Atmospheric parameters
Adopting the typical value RV = 3.1, E(B−V) = 0.14 (Monty
et al. 2018) and a distance of 9.83 kpc (Baumgardt & Vasiliev
2021), we ﬁrst de-reddened the optical Gaia EDR3 photomet-
ric bands. We obtain Teﬀ and log (g) from photometry by de-
termining the reddening-corrected CMD of NGC 2298. We then
horizontally projected the position of each observed star until it
intersected the PARSEC (Bressan et al. 2012) isochrone, chosen
to have an age of ∼12 Gyr (Monty et al. 2018), a metallicity of
[Fe/H] ∼ −1.75 (see Table A.1), and an assumed Teﬀ and log (g)
to be the temperature and gravity at the point of the isochrones
that has the same optical magnitude as the star. Since no dif-
ferential reddening was present, we could easily separate RGB
from AGB stars. For each group, we used the corresponding part
of the isochrone to obtain the parameters, that is, we used the
isochrone RGB to obtain Teﬀ and log (g) for RGB stars, and the
isochrone AGB to obtain Teﬀ and log (g) for AGB stars. Finally,
microturbulence velocities ξt were determined empirically with
the BACCHUS code (Masseron et al. 2016). The resulting atmo-
spheric parameters and elemental abundances for the 12 stars
examined in the innermost regions of NGC 2298 are listed in
Table A.1.

5. Abundance determinations

Once the ﬁnal atmospheric parameters were computed, abun-
dances for a variety of elements could be derived line-by-line
using the BACCHUS code. Thus, chemical abundances were de-
rived for six atomic species (Mg I, Al I, Si I, Ca I, Fe I, and
Ni I) from a local thermodynamics equilibrium (LTE) analysis
using BACCHUS combined with the MARCS model atmospheres

of the 12 NGC 2298 stars analyzed in this work, and they are centered at (cid:104)[Fe/H](cid:105) = −1.86 (ASPCAP results) and (cid:104)[Fe/H](cid:105) = −1.76 (BACCHUS
results), respectively. The 12 stars examined in this work are denoted by navy blue star symbols in all panels.

tion with horizontal lines.

In the following, we describe the chemical-enrichment level
of NGC 2298 for the diﬀerent chemical species examined in this
work.

6.1. α elements (Mg, Si, and Ca)

From inspection of Table A.1, the median and mean values for
the α elements from Mg to Ca in NGC 2298 are overabundant
((cid:38) +0.12) compared to the Sun, supporting the idea that the main
contributors to the chemistry of this cluster have likely been

denoted by open and ﬁlled symbols, respectively. The dashed lines and
inset notation represent the linear regression of the data.

mostly provided by supernovae (SNe) II events (Tsujimoto &
Bekki 2012), which have been formed before SNe Ia could sig-
niﬁcantly contribute with iron. This is a feature very common to
almost all Galactic GCs with a similar metallicity in the outer
halo, and a metallicity below [Fe/H] = −1.0.

The NGC 2298 sample has a star-to-star spread in [Si/Fe]∼
0.15 dex and [Ca/Fe]∼ 0.13 dex, which is slightly larger than
the measurement uncertainties for each species, with the ex-
ception of [Mg/Fe]. There is a signiﬁcant [Mg/Fe] spread of
∼ 0.3 dex, exceeding the observational uncertainties, which is
anti-correlated with [Al/Fe] (see subsection 6.2). However, the
[Mg/Fe] abundance ratio by itself exhibits a median value that is
systematically oﬀset by roughly 0.2 dex lower than M 53, M 55,
and NGC 6397 stars from Mészáros et al. (2020), as can be ap-
preciated in Figure 3. There are several reasons for a systematic
oﬀset between our [Mg/Fe] determinations and those determined
by Mészáros et al. (2020). For instance, non-local thermody-
namic equilibrium (NLTE) and/or 3D eﬀects are currently not
modeled when ﬁtting the APOGEE spectra; and/or the system-
atic diﬀerences in the temperature scales.

Figure 5 reveals an apparent Mg-Si anti-correlation. The
existence of a Mg-Si anti-correlation in NGC 2298 implies
the presence of leakage from the MgAl chain into Si produc-
tion through the 26Al(p,γ27Si(e−,ν)27Al(p,γ)28Si reactions at a
high temperature. In the absence of this leakage, we would ex-
pect a simple correlation between Mg and Si since they are
both α elements (see, e.g., Yong et al. 2005; Carretta et al.
2009b; Mészáros et al. 2020). We ﬁnd that some of the stars
in NGC 2298 exhibit a higher Si abundance than their Mg-
rich counterparts, conﬁrming the likely occurrence of hot proton
burning in the early populations of NGC 2298. It is important to
note that the evidence for this Mg-Si anti-correlation does not ex-
ist for the other GCs at a similar metallicity as that of NGC 2298.
An Al-Si correlation is also observed in NGC 2298, as can
be appreciated in Figure 5. Yong et al. (2005), Carretta et al.
(2009b), Mészáros et al. (2015), Masseron et al. (2019), and
Mészáros et al. (2020) interpreted the Al-Si correlation as a sig-
nature of 28Si leakage from the Mg-Al chain. Interestingly, most
of the Si-enriched stars in NGC 2298 also seem to correspond to
the Mg-depleted and Al-enhanced cluster population, which are
likely the result of Ne-Na and Mg-Al cycles occurring in the H-
burning shell of the ﬁrst-generation stars whose nucleosynthetic
products were later distributed through the cluster. We stress that,
regarding any possible analysis bias, we have not been able to
ﬁnd any dependence of the abundances with the evolutionary
status.

6.2. The odd-Z element Al

Similar to the result reported 30 years ago by McWilliam et al.
(1992), we conﬁrm that this cluster also hosts a clear population
of Al-enhanced stars with [Al/Fe] (cid:38) +0.5, which is signiﬁcantly
higher than typical Galactic abundances of [Al/Fe]< +0.5 (for
the typical ﬁrst-generation stars). Figure 5 also clearly reveals
two distinct groups in the Mg-Al plane; one of them lies in the
region dominated by the lowest [Al/Fe] abundances with slightly
super-Solar [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios rather than sub-Solar ones
(often called ﬁrst-generation stars or unenriched stars), while the
second group is governed by higher [Al/Fe] abundances with the
lowest [Mg/Fe] abundances, containing a fraction of stars well
below [Mg/Fe] ≈0 (called second-generation or enriched stars).
We conclude that the intra-GC abundance variations reported in
Figure 5 are indicative of the presence of the MP phenomenon

in NGC 2298, but the origin of the polluting material remains
elusive based on these data.

We also detect a signiﬁcant star-to-star spread ((cid:38) 1.29 dex)
in [Al/Fe], as can be appreciated in Figure 5. An anti-correlation
between Al and Mg is clearly present in NGC 2298, showing the
signs of proton burning of the envelope material by the Mg-Al
cycle, which is commonly present in most metal-poor GCs. It is
clear that the extended distribution of Al and Mg is much larger
than the typical errors of [Al/Fe] and [Mg/Fe].

With our cluster sample, we agree with the previous claim by
McWilliam et al. (1992) regarding the presence of a strong Al en-
hancement in NGC 2298. However, our large sample conﬁrms,
for the ﬁrst time, the presence of a clear Mg-Al anti-correlation
in NGC 2298, whose proton-burning Mg-Al cycle drives the ex-
cess of Al through the reduced surface abundances of 24Mg (see
e.g., Ward & Fowler 1980).

We also ﬁnd that the RGB and AGB stars do not group
separately in any of the abundance-abundance planes presented
in Figure 5. Therefore, the observed Mg-Al anti-correlation in
NGC 2298 does not depend on the evolutionary status of a star.

6.3. Iron-peak elements (Fe and Ni)

We ﬁnd a mean metallicity (cid:104)[Fe/H](cid:105) = −1.76 ± 0.01 with a dis-
persion of σ[Fe/H] = 0.048±0.009 dex. Reported errors are errors
on the mean. We also ﬁnd an iron star-to-star spread of 0.14 dex,
compatible with the measurement errors, so we have no evidence
for an intrinsic Fe abundance spread in NGC 2298. Our mea-
sured mean metallicity for this GC exhibits a deviation greater
than the uncertainties in comparison to some previous works that
employ a variety of methods reporting a wide range (∼0.25 dex)
of metallicity from [Fe/H]= −1.96 to −1.71, but it is in reason-
able agreement with a few of them. For instance, Frogel et al.
(1983) transformed optical and NIR colors to Cohen’s metal-
licity scale (Cohen 1983), and they estimated a mean value of
[Fe/H]= −1.76, which has been listed as [Fe/H]IR in Table 5 of
Zinn & West (1984); Zinn & West (1984) found a mean metallic-
ity of [Fe/H]= −1.85; Zinn (1985) found a [Fe/H]= −1.81 on his
metallicity scale; McWilliam et al. (1992) found a metallicity of
[Fe/H] = −1.91; Geisler et al. (1995) estimated a metallicity of
[Fe/H] = −1.82; Salaris & Cassisi (1996) reported a metallicity
of [Fe/H]= −1.91; Carretta & Gratton (1997) reported a metal-
licity of [Fe/H] = −1.71; while Kraft & Ivans (2003) listed a
range of metallicity [Fe/H] between −1.93 to −1.83; Pritzl et al.
(2005) reported a metallicity of [Fe/H] = −1.90; Carretta et al.
(2009a) provided a metallicity of [Fe/H]−1.96; Carrera et al.
(2013) listed a [Fe/H]= −1.74; while more recently Roediger
et al. (2014) and Yong et al. (2014) have provided a metallicity
estimation of [Fe/H] = −1.95 and [Fe/H] = −1.96, respectively.
As far as other iron-peak elements are concerned, Ni is
slightly overabundant relative to Solar (+0.12), with a star-to-star
spread of 0.27 dex that is higher than the measurement uncertain-
ties of [Ni/Fe] abundance ratios in NGC 2298, which strikingly
appear to be weakly correlated with [Ca/Fe], as can be appre-
ciated in Figure 5. However, the observed star-to-star spread in
the [Ca/Fe] abundance ratios is not statistically signiﬁcant ac-
cording to our error analysis, as has been observed in other GCs
(Carretta & Bragaglia 2021). Our sample is tightly concentrated
around the mean [Ca/Fe] of NGC 2298. Therefore, with the de-
terminations of [Ni/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] for a limited sample of six
cluster stars, we cannot draw ﬁrm conclusions about the appar-
ent correlation between these two species. This possibility will
have to be considered using larger future samples.

cluster stars taken from Mészáros et al. (2020) at a similar metallicity as NGC 2298. Stars in NGC 2298 are denoted by navy blue star symbols,
with open and ﬁlled symbols indicating RGB and AGB stars, respectively. The inset box plots indicates, with horizontal red lines, the median

7. Concluding remarks

We have performed a high-resolution spectral analysis for 12
stars in the old GC NGC 2298. This cluster is located in a re-
gion of low interstellar reddening, and it has a halo orbit that
crosses the Bulge, with an apocentric distance of ∼16.44 kpc
(Massari et al. 2019). We found a mean and median metallicity
of [Fe/H] = −1.76 and −1.75, respectively, with a star-to-star
spread of 0.14 dex that is compatible with the measurement er-

rors, so we ﬁnd no evidence for an intrinsic Fe abundance spread
in NGC 2298. Our reported metallicity is ∼ 0.2 dex more metal-
rich than previously thought, but it is in reasonable agreement
with estimations provided by Kraft & Ivans (2003) and Carrera
et al. (2013).

We conﬁrm the existence of an Al-enriched population in
NGC 2298, as was claimed three decades ago. We provide, for
the ﬁrst time, evidence for the standard anti-correlation between

Ian Baeza et al.: NIR chemical abundances in NGC 2298

Mg and Al in our data. This result indicates the prevalence of the
MPs phenomenon at the low metallicity of NGC 2298. It is also
important to note that RGB and AGB stars present in NGC 2298
do not appear to follow diﬀerent paths or group separately in
any of the abundance planes examined in this work; therefore,
we conclude that the observed Mg-Al anti-correlation does not
depend on the evolutionary status of a star in NGC 2298. We also
detect an apparent Mg-Si anti-correlation and an Al-Si correla-
tion, which are likely signatures of 28Si leakage from the Mg-
Al chain, which is a feature common to other GCs (Masseron
et al. 2019; Mészáros et al. 2020) at a similar metallicity as
NGC 2298.
