ABSTRACT
Modern code review is a critical and indispensable practice in a
pull-request development paradigm that prevails in Open Source
Software (OSS) development. Finding a suitable reviewer in projects
with massive participants thus becomes an increasingly challenging
task. Many reviewer recommendation approaches (recommenders)
have been developed to support this task which apply a similar
strategy, i.e. modeling the review history first then followed by
predicting/recommending a reviewer based on the model. Appar-
ently, the better the model reflects the reality in review history,
the higher recommender’s performance we may expect. However,
one typical scenario in a pull-request development paradigm, i.e.
one Pull-Request (PR) (such as a revision or addition submitted by
a contributor) may have multiple reviewers and they may impact
each other through publicly posted comments, has not been mod-
eled well in existing recommenders. We adopted the hypergraph
technique to model this high-order relationship (i.e. one PR with
multiple reviewers herein) and developed a new recommender,
namely HGRec, which is evaluated by 12 OSS projects with more
than 87K PRs, 680K comments in terms of accuracy and recommen-
dation distribution. The results indicate that HGRec outperforms
the state-of-the-art recommenders on recommendation accuracy.
Besides, among the top three accurate recommenders, HGRec is
more likely to recommend a diversity of reviewers, which can help
to relieve the core reviewers’ workload congestion issue. Moreover,
since HGRec is based on hypergraph, which is a natural and in-
terpretable representation to model review history, it is easy to
accommodate more types of entities and realistic relationships in
modern code review scenarios. As the first attempt, this study re-
veals the potentials of hypergraph on advancing the pragmatic
solutions for code reviewer recommendation.

1 INTRODUCTION
As a popular software practice, code review is believed to be para-
mount to software quality for both commercial projects and Open
Source Software (OSS) projects [9, 41, 43, 49]. Through manually
scrutinizing source code, reviewers aim to identify possible issues
or improvement opportunities and thereby prevent issue-prone
code snippets from being incorporated into project repositories [7].
In addition to secure quality, code review is also helpful in knowl-
edge dissemination, team collaboration [5, 8, 30, 52], etc. However,
studies show that code review highly relies on the experience and
knowledge of reviewers [24, 32], which implies that the identifica-
tion of suitable reviewers is crucial to review efficacy.

Nowadays, an informal, asynchronous and tool-based code re-
view practice that is known as Modern Code Review (MCR) is
widely adopted in software development [33]. In the OSS com-
munity, MCR is an essential step in a so-called pull-request de-
velopment paradigm [56, 57], where developers make changes to
some code snippets and submit a Pull-Request (PR) to the project
repository. Then potential reviewers (including project owners)
examine the PR and provide feedback through an issue tracking
system (e.g., JIRA1, Gerrit2, etc.); if the issues related to the PR were
properly addressed, one project owner then merges the PR into
the project repository [25, 59]. Studies indicate that MCR quality
is subject to many factors, among which the reviewers’ expertise
and workload can make a significant difference [6, 24, 40]. In this
sense, it is also crucial to find suitable reviewers for a certain PR,
especially in the context of the OSS development where the poten-
tially massive participants are usually geographically distributed
and not necessarily known to each other. In fact, as Thongtanunam
et al. pointed out, inappropriate assignment of code reviewer may
take 12 days longer to approve a code change in OSS development,
thus a recommendation tool is necessary to speed up a code review
process [51].

In the past decade, researchers have worked out a number of
reviewer recommendation approaches (recommenders) in order to

automatically assign a PR to potentially suitable reviewers. In gen-
eral, recommenders are developed by following a similar strategy,
i.e., to predict/recommend a reviewer based on a model from histor-
ical reviews. For example, heuristic-based recommenders model the
review history by mining simple rules based on the relationships
among source files, revisions, and participants. That is, whoever
most frequently revised or reviewed the source code snippets in-
cluded in a certain PR previously should be recommended to per-
form the review first. Learning-based recommenders model the
review history by machine learning techniques [17, 18] and then
use the trained models to determine the most potentially suitable
reviewers.

It is widely agreed that models play a vital role in all recom-
menders. However, the models behind heuristics-based recom-
menders are combinations of simple rules reflecting relationships,
which is very likely to miss crucial information (e.g., the mutual
impacts among reviewers). This may be one of the reasons that
most heuristics-based recommenders can not achieve satisfactory
recommendation accuracy [18, 28]. Meanwhile, the learning-based
recommenders may be able to process more information of the
review history yet the low interpretable models behind and heavy
workload on feature engineering also prevent them from evolv-
ing to quickly adapt themselves to new situations. Recently, some
researchers began to apply graph techniques to model the rela-
tionships among entities such as source code, participants, PRs,
etc. As the modeling data structure, a graph is able to support
more sophisticated heuristics algorithms. Besides, it is also able to
support multiple machine learning algorithms and improve model
interpretability [55, 58].

However, since a single edge in an ordinary graph can only
associate two vertexes, it is difficult (if not impossible) to model a
common phenomenon in OSS development, i.e., one PR may involve
multiple reviewers. As a result, most graph-based recommenders
also have not presented satisfactory recommendation accuracy [21,
53].

Figure 1: Ordinary graph and hypergraph

Recently, a technique namely hypergraph has been utilized to
model the complex relationships among multiple entities. Briefly,
a hypergraph is a generalization of an ordinary graph in which
an edge can associate any number of vertexes. For example, as
shown on the right of Figure 1, a hyperedge 𝑒2 simultaneously
connects three vertexes (𝑛2, 𝑛5, 𝑛6). In contrast, in an ordinary
graph, an edge connects exactly two vertexes (shown on the left

of Figure 1). Take Figure 2 as a review example, there are three
reviewers, namely Reviewer A, Reviewer B and Reviewer C having
reviewed the identical PR. In an ordinary graph, the review history
is modeled as reviewer pairs, i.e., Reviewer (A, B), Reviewer (B, C)
and Reviewer (A, C) have reviewed one same PR. However, the fact
that Reviewer A, B and C actually have reviewed the same PR is
not able to be reflected in an ordinary graph. Since certain form of
familiarity (e.g., similar review experience/history) forms the basis
for most reviewer recommenders, the loss of this information will
inevitably impact the recommendation performance. In contrast,
since multiple vertexes can be included in one edge, hypergraph of-
fers more natural approaches to model the review history portrayed
in Figure 2, which provides more information for recommenders to
perform recommendation.

Figure 2: One PR involves multiple reviewers in practice

In this study, we applied the hypergraph technique to model
the aforementioned complex relationship among various entities
in a natural and interpretable way. Based on this model, we also
developed a new reviewer recommender, namely HGRec to explore
the feasibility and effectiveness of this strategy. An extensive em-
pirical study based on 12 OSS projects with more than 87K PRs and
680K review comments indicates the superiority of HGRec in terms
of recommendation accuracy as well as workload balance among
reviewers. The contributions of this study can be highlighted as
below.

• To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort that
hypergraph is used to model code reviews as well as complex
relationships among participants, e.g., one reviewer may be
affected by others’ comments.

• We developed a new recommender, i.e., HGRec, based on

hypergraph technologies.

• We empirically evaluated HGRec, the results indicate that HGRec
not only outperforms the state-of-the-art recommenders in
terms of recommendation accuracy, but to some extent miti-
gates the workload congestion issue.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Code Reviewer Recommendation
2.1.1 Recommenders. Automated reviewer recommendation has
attracted a lot of attention in the past decade. A number of recom-
menders have been proposed, which follow a similar strategy in
general, i.e., modeling review history and use the result model to
recommend a new reviewer. In general, there are three main types of
recommenders according to different modeling approaches, i.e. the
heuristics-based, learning-based, and graph-based recommenders,
respectively.

Heuristics-based recommenders. This type of recommenders sug-
gests new reviewers with simple heuristic rules. For example, Thong-
tanunam et al. [50] proposed a recommender based on file path simi-
larity, which subsequently evolved into RevFinder [51]. The RevFinder
is based on the similarity between the file paths of a previous PR
and a new PR. Zanjani et al. [60] developed a recommender (cHRev)
that determines candidates on a basic premise that the reviewers
who have reviewed target code snippets before are most likely
to be recommended. Rahman et al. [38] proposed a recommender
(CORRECT) that utilizes external library similarity and technol-
ogy expertise similarity of reviewers, which provides a possibility
for cross-project reviewer recommendation. Jiang et al. [21] ana-
lyzed several attributes related to the code review and found that
activeness-based recommender (AC) performed the best. Other
rules adopted in the heuristics-based recommenders include Line 10
Rule [42], Expertise Recommender [31], Code Ownership [14] and Ex-
pertise Cloud [2], etc. Usually, the ‘models’ used by the heuristics-
based recommenders are merely simple statistics or comparison
results on the original review history. Most heuristic-based recom-
menders are easy to understand. However, research indicates that
most of them suffer from low accuracy. Moreover, it is usually hard
to add more elements (information) to enhance the models based
on simple heuristic rules, which impacts their evolvability.

Learning-based recommenders. This type of recommenders as-
sumes that the PR profile and reviewers’ personal expertise can be
automatically learned from the review history by training. Among
them, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and
Bayesian Network (BN ) are widely applied [16–19]. de Lima Júnior
et al. [11] investigated several kinds of learning-based recommenders,
including Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (J48), RF, and Sequential
Minimal Optimization (SMO) and found that RF outperforms others
in terms of recommendation accuracy. In general, learning-based
recommenders usually perform better than simple heuristics-based
recommenders, however, the models behind these recommenders
need a heavy workload on feature engineering, training, and long-
term maintenance. Besides, they are normally not interpretable also,
which becomes a barrier for future extension and improvement for
the recommenders.

Graph-based recommenders. Recently, graph techniques have
been adopted to model the review history [26, 36, 44, 45, 58], through
which personal profiles and social relationships or networks be-
tween developers and reviewers are thus formalized into graph
vertexes and edges. Using graph as the model, both sophisticated
heuristics and learning algorithms can be used to design recom-
menders. For example, Yu et al. [58] found that developers who

share common interests with a PR originator are potentially suitable
reviewer candidates. Liao et al. [26] combined PR topic model with
social networks to build the connections between collaborators and
PRs. Sülün et al. [44] used software artifact traceability graphs to
recommend reviewers who potentially are familiar with a given
artifact.

2.1.2 Recommendation distribution. The rationale behind nearly
all the recommenders implies that one reviewer who conducted the
most reviews in the history tends to be recommended in a future
review. As a matter of fact, it is common that a few core reviewers
took over the most workloads on code review [54], which becomes
a severe issue of “workload congestion” for some core reviewers,
leading to review overload for these core reviewers [35]. Recent
studies have proposed some solutions to alleviate the workload
congestion. Asthana et al. [4] proposed a recommender (WhoDo)
where reviewers’ scores are reduced by his/her incomplete PRs
so as to decrease his/her chance to be recommended. Al-Zubaidi
et al. [1] presented a workload-aware recommender (WLRRec) by
utilizing NSGA-II, a multi-objective search-based approach to ad-
dress two main objectives – maximizing the chance of participating
in a review and, minimizing the skewness of review workload
distribution. Rebai et al. [39] balanced the conflicting objectives
of expertise, availability, and history of collaborations with multi-
objective search techniques. Mirsaeedi et al. [35] systematically take
expertise, workload, and knowledge distribution for collaborators
in recommending new reviewers.

In short, the workload congestion issue has raised wide concern
in the research community on reviewer recommenders and should
not be neglected in designing and evaluating recommenders.

2.2 Hypergraph Approach for Software

Engineering

A hypergraph is an extension of the ordinary graph that consists
of multiple vertexes and hyperedges, which can depict the high-
order relationships among entities [13, 61]. Therefore, unlike the
pairwise relationships depicted in an ordinary graph, hypergraph
has the ability to express complex relationships in the real world,
which prevents information loss as far as possible [27, 29, 37, 62].
This merit enables hypergraph techniques to be used in some soft-
ware engineering scenarios. For example, Göde et al. [15] used
hypergraph-based models on cloned code fragments and analyzed
clone evolution in mature projects. Thomé et al. [48] used hyper-
graph to implement a search-driven string constraint solving al-
gorithm to detect vulnerabilities in the program. Jiang et al. [20]
used hypergraphs to represent code and implemented a framework
for interring program transformations. While the studies that use
hypergraph techniques to model the complex relationships among
software artifacts are not rare, to the best of our knowledge, this
technique has never been used in reviewer recommendation, which
usually involves both entities such as humans and artifacts as well as
the complex and high-order relationships among different entities.
This motivates the hypergraph-based recommender (i.e., HGRec)
that is proposed in this study.

Figure 3: Overview of HGRec

3 APPROACH
There are two major steps to design and implement HGRec, i.e., hy-
pergraph construction and reviewer recommendation, respectively.
In this section, we elaborate these two steps in detail.

3.1 Approach Overview
Figure 3 depicts the two major steps of HGRec. The top segment
shows the process to construct a base hypergraph (𝐺𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 ), which
is based on the review history retrieved from project repositories;
the bottom of Figure 3 presents the process to recommend poten-
tially suitable reviewers for an incoming new PR, say 𝑝𝑡 . The basic
idea is to add 𝑝𝑡 and corresponding contributor (𝑎𝑡 ) to the existing
hypergraph 𝐺𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 to form a new hypergraph 𝐺𝑡 using the simi-
lar strategy to construct 𝐺𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 . Then a hypergraph-based search
strategy which calculates vertex score using a localized first-order
approximation [10] is applied to rank and recommend candidate
reviewers. Details of the hypergraph construction and reviewer
recommendation will be elaborated in the following subsections.

In order to eliminate ambiguity, we first define some key nota-
tions in Table 1. To be specific, the review history of an OSS project
is represented by a set of PRs (PRS), including the contributors (𝑎𝑖 ),
reviewers (𝑅𝑖 ) and changed file paths (𝐹𝑖 ) involved in each PR (𝑝𝑖 ).
A hypergraph (𝐺𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 ) is used to model the review history, based on
which, a new hypergraph (𝐺𝑡 ) is generated by adding an incoming
new PR, say 𝑝𝑡 , to 𝐺𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 .

3.2 Hypergraph Construction
Intuitively, for a target PR, the adjacent PRs in terms of file paths
share certain similarities regarding content or function, which may

also be able to reflect the similarity regarding experience and famil-
iarity towards the target PR among the contributors and reviewers
involved in these PRs. Using hypergraph the relationships among
different entities involved in these PRs can be created in a succinct
and natural representation. Two major steps are included to con-
struct a hypergraph, i.e. the architecture building and the edge
weight, respectively. As shown in Algorithm 1, function Construc-
tion depicts the former step, while the latter step is described by
the function BuildEdge.

In general, function Construction describes the main logic for
hypergraph construction, which takes review history (contribu-
tors, reviewers, PRs, etc.) as inputs. Lines 2 initializes the vertex set
𝑉𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 and hyperedge set 𝐸𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 . The ‘for loop’ in lines 3-8 updates
hypergraph by adding new vertexes of PRs, contributors and re-
viewers as well as hyperedges of PR-Reviewer and PR-Contributor.

A Hypergraph Approach

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

The hyperedges representing PR-PR relationship should be sepa-
rately processed (in lines 9-17) since global information is needed to
calculate edge weight. Finally, line 19 returns the result hypergraph
𝐺𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 . Note that function Construction invokes the function Build-
Edge to calculate the weights for hyperedges according to different
relationships, which is detailed in lines 22-25. Since different types
of relationships require different methods to calculate the edge
weight, we elaborate them in detail as the following.

PR-Reviewer: The relationships between PRs and reviewers are
necessary for all kinds of graph-based recommenders. In a pull-
request development paradigm, one PR may experience multiple
revisions and re-submissions, which would usually engage multiple
reviewers and they may impact each other by publicly posted review
comments. Therefore, in addition to the regular relationship, i.e. a
pair of one reviewer and one PR, reviewers who comment on the
same PR are connected with a hyperedge in a hypergraph.

In HGRec, the weight of a PR-Reviewer edge is set by aggregating

all reviewers’ contributions, which is formulated in Equation 1.

𝑜1𝑖
∑︁

∑︁

𝜆 𝑗−1𝑒

𝑡𝑖 𝑗 −𝑡𝑒
𝑡𝑒 −𝑡𝑠

𝑤 =

𝑟1𝑖 ∈𝑅1

𝑗=1

(1)

where reviewers in set 𝑅1 participated in the PR 𝑝1, reviewer 𝑟1𝑖
made 𝑜1𝑖 comments in the PR 𝑝1. The creation time of each comment
is 𝑡𝑖 𝑗 . The hyperparameter 𝜆 in Equation 1 works for mitigating
the influence of comments (cf. subsection 3.4 for details). Moreover,
reviewers’ activeness was also considered in HGRec, i.e. the closer
reviews are, the greater influence they carried. 𝑡𝑠 and 𝑡𝑒 are the
start time and the end time of dataset in Equation 1.

PR-Contributor: Contributors and reviewers may play differ-
ent roles in a pull-request development paradigm. Therefore, they
are treated differently in HGRec by defining the PR-Contributor
relationship and the corresponding weight. As Equation 2, the more
recent activity is, the higher weight.

𝑤 =

𝑡1 − 𝑡𝑠
𝑡𝑒 − 𝑡𝑠

(2)

𝑡1 is the creation time of PR 𝑝1. 𝑡𝑠 and 𝑡𝑒 take the same meaning as
in Equation 1.

PR-PR: The profiles (e.g., language, code lines) and content (e.g.,
the source code) included in PRs to a certain degree can reflect the
expertise of contributors. Moreover, it is also common that closely
located source files share similar functions, and hence can be used
for reviewer recommendation [51]. Therefore, the weight of PR-PR
relationship is achieved by considering the distances between PRs
in the file path set (as shown in Equation 3).
Similarity(𝑓1, 𝑓2)
|𝐹1||𝐹2|

𝑒− |𝑡1−𝑡2 |

𝑤 =

∑︁

𝑡𝑒 −𝑡𝑠

(3)

𝑓1 ∈𝐹1,𝑓2 ∈𝐹2

where function Similarity is calculated as Equation 4,

Similarity(𝑓1, 𝑓2) =

LCP(𝑓1, 𝑓2)
max(len(𝑓1), len(𝑓2))

(4)

where 𝐹1, 𝐹2 are the file path sets contained in two PRs, say 𝑝1 and
𝑝2. 𝑓1 and 𝑓2 are the specific file paths that belong to the file path
sets 𝐹1 and 𝐹2.

We also model developers’ turnover as an exponential function
to smoothen the distance between two PRs. In the exponential func-
tion of Equation 3, 𝑡𝑠 and 𝑡𝑒 are the creation and end time of dataset,
𝑡1 and 𝑡2 are the creation time of two PRs respectively. Through this
way, within a certain time scope, the latest PRs are preferentially
considered. To reduce calculation cost, we restricted the number of
neighbors for a certain PR and simplified the hypergraph that only
top-𝑚 PR-PR connections (cf. subsection 3.4 for details) were in-
cluded. Moreover, we employed a MIN-MAX strategy to normalize
the weight for each type of edge.

3.3 Reviewer Recommendation
With a constructed hypergraph in hand, we then can perform a rec-
ommendation calculation based on the hypergraph. In general, we
formulated reviewer recommendation as a ranking task on a hyper-
graph. Previous studies (e.g., [55]) used ‘random walk’ strategy to
choose neighborhood as the next vertex with a certain probability,
which is somehow low-effective. Inspired by [46], we applied an ad-
vanced ‘search and ranking’ strategy in HGRec, which is elaborated
briefly in this subsection.

Given a hypergraph 𝐺𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 and a newly-submitted 𝑝𝑡 , we first
develop PR-PR relationship by calculating its file path similarities
with existing PRs in 𝐺𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 and then we connect 𝑝𝑡 with the most
similar PRs. By following a similar strategy (Algorithm 1), we can
establish the PR-Contributor relationship. In this way, both new PRs
and contributors are merged into the original hypergraph 𝐺𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 to
form a new 𝐺𝑡 = {𝑉𝑡 , 𝐸𝑡 }.

For a hypergraph 𝐺, the key of this ranking strategy is to find
the appropriate ranking vector 𝑓 ∗ ∈ R|𝑉 | which is able to minimize
the objective function 𝑄 (𝑓 ) defined as below:

𝑄 (𝑓 ) = 𝑓 𝑇 (𝑰 − 𝑨) 𝑓 + 𝜇 (𝑓 − 𝑦)𝑇 (𝑓 − 𝑦)

(5)

where 𝑦 ∈ R |𝑉 | is a query vector with multiple elements, one
for each vertex of the hypergraph 𝐺 which will be set to 1 for
a target PR and its contributor, otherwise 0. 𝑯𝐺 ∈ R |𝑉 |×|𝐸 | is a
vertex-hyperedge incidence matrix, 𝑾 𝑮 ∈ R |𝐸 |×|𝐸 | is a weight
matrix, 𝑫𝐺
𝑒 is a hyperedge degree
matrix, 𝑨 = 𝑫𝐺
, and 𝜇 is the regularization
𝑣
parameter.

𝑣 is a vertex degree matrix and 𝑫𝐺

Through a series of deductions and transformations, we have

Having ranked on the hypergraph, we can recommend the top-𝑘
reviewers as the candidates. The whole recommendation process is
presented in Algorithm 2.

Algorithm 2 takes hypergraph 𝐺𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 , PR set PRS, and target PR as
its inputs. Line 2 initializes candidate list 𝐶𝑡 . Line 3 is to add vertexes
of three types of entities. Lines 4-12 also invoke function BuildEdge
(cf. Algorithm 1) to build relationships of PR-Contributor and PR-
PR. Line 13 generates the query vector 𝑦𝑡 by 𝑝𝑡 . Line 14 optimizes
objective function 𝑄 (𝑓 ) and get the ranking vector. Lines 15-16 rank
and return a recommendation list according to ranking strategy.

3.4 Hyperparameter Setting
The hyperparameters, i.e. 𝛼 ∈ [0, 1], 𝑚 ∈ [5, 15], 𝜆 ∈ [0, 1] play crit-
ical roles in HGRec. 𝛼 is the regularization parameter. The smaller
𝛼, the larger influence of regulation, that is, the weight of vertexes
access to query vector 𝑦. In this case, the nearby reviewers around
target PRs and contributors have more chances to be recommended.
𝑚 represents the maximum connections of a PR, 𝜆 represents the in-
fluence posed by a reviewer in a history review. Increasing 𝛼, HGRec
tends to recommend non-core reviewers, which is important to mit-
igate workload congestion issue discussed in Section 2.1.2. Increas-
ing 𝑚 or reducing 𝜆, HGRec tends to recommend core reviewers.
Since there are no specific rules to determine 𝛼, 𝑚 and 𝜆, we set
them by a ‘trial-and-error’ approach. After many rounds of trial
calculations, we found that HGRec can produce relatively good
results under the following combination of parameters, i.e. 𝛼 = 0.9,
𝑚 = 10, 𝜆 = 0.8.

4 EVALUATION DESIGN
4.1 Research Questions
Two research questions (RQs) are proposed for the evaluation,
which are

• RQ1: To what extent can the proposed HGRec accurately

recommend code reviewers?

• RQ2: To what extent can the proposed HGRec alleviate work-

load congestion issue?

RQ1 evaluates the performance of HGRec in terms of accuracy,
whereas RQ2 assesses HGRec’s capability of dealing with the other
concern – workload congestion issue.

(cf. subsection 4.3.1). As a result, we chose 12 well-known projects
in GitHub to evaluate the performance of HGRec as well as other
recommenders in order to position our recommender. The time
span of the dataset is from 2017-01-01 to 2020-06-30. Detailed de-
mographics of the dataset are presented in Table 2.

4.3 Experiment Settings
4.3.1 Baselines. To evaluate HGRec thoroughly, the following rep-
resentative traditional recommenders and state-of-the-art recom-
menders as well are compared as the baselines, which are

• AC [21] that recommends reviewers based on recent ac-
tivities of the candidates. Reviewers who leave comments
frequently in recent PRs are determined to be active and
prone to be recommended; otherwise inactive.

• RevFinder [51] that recommends reviewers by leveraging
the file path similarities of PRs, i.e. the files located in close
files may share similar functionality and therefore should be
reviewed by reviewers with similar experience.

• cHRev [60] that recommends reviewers on the premise that
who previously reviewed the code files is tended to be candi-
date reviewers for a target PR. cHRev formulates reviewers’
expertise based on “how many”, “who performed”, and “when
reviews were performed”.

• CN [58] that recommends reviewers by aggregating devel-
opers who share common interests with the contributor of
target PR. CN mines historical comment traces to construct
a comment network to make recommendations.

• RF [11] that recommends reviewers by applying supervised
machine learning, i.e. collecting project attributes and PRs
to construct classifiers and rank candidates.

• EARec [55] that recommends reviewers by constructing a
graph architecture to depict the expertise and authority of
developers as well as their interactions. The recommendation
is performed using graph searching algorithms.

4.2 Data Preparation
GitHub provides multiples APIs to assess various project data. For
potential comparison and calibration, the chosen projects are the
common ones from previous studies. Since the evaluation involves
several time-consuming tasks, as a balance between resources (e.g.,
time, computing resource,etc.) and the capability to generalize the
evaluation results, we selected those projects that appear at least in
two of the previous studies containing the baseline recommenders

The considerations are three-fold. First, AC and RF have shown
impressively good performance in terms of accuracy in many stud-
ies [12, 21]. Second, CN and EARec both adopt graph (an ordinary
graph) as the underlying model. Last but not least, as two classi-
cal recommenders, RevFinder and cHRev have been used as the
comparison basis frequently in many existing studies.

4.3.2 Metrics. To address RQ1, we need to evaluate the perfor-
mance of HGRec in terms of accuracy. We take two common metrics

Modeling Review History for Reviewer Recommendation:
A Hypergraph Approach

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

in recommender evaluation studies, i.e. Accuracy (ACC) (defined as
Equation 7) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) (defined as Equation
8).

• Accuracy

ACC =

1
|PRS|

∑︁

𝑝 ∈PRS

isTrue(𝑝, 𝑘)

(7)

where, PRS is a set of target PRs, indicator function isTrue(p, k)
returns 1 if the recommended reviewer within top-𝑘 candidates
finally reviewed the target PR 𝑝, otherwise returns 0.

• Mean Reciprocal Rank

MRR =

1
|PRS|

∑︁

𝑝 ∈PRS

1
rank(𝑝, 𝑘)

(8)

where function rank(p, k) returns the location where the true re-
viewer places in the sorted reviewer list. MRR rewards score 1 if
the first choice was correct and rewards 1/2 if the second choice
was correct, and so on. While if the recommended reviewer is not
contained in the candidate list, then MRR rewards 0. The final MRR
is calculated as the average value of all the scores.

To answer RQ2, we defined Recommendation Distribution (RD)
as Equation 9 to measure the extent that diverse reviewers can be
recommended.

• Recommendation Distribution (RD)

RD = −

1
𝑙𝑜𝑔2𝑛

𝑛
∑︁

𝑃 (𝑖)𝑙𝑜𝑔2𝑃 (𝑖)

(9)

𝑖=1
where, n is the total number of reviewers, 𝑃 (𝑖) is a percentage that
indicates the workload of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ reviewer. The larger RD, the more
diverse that a recommender recommends reviewers.

As a popular standard in the related studies, we evaluated the
top-𝑘 (𝑘=1, 3, 5) performances of the recommenders. To further test
the difference, we established hypotheses and applied the Wilcoxon
Signed Rank Test on ACC, MRR and RD. The null and alternative
hypotheses can be stated as follows,

𝐻0,𝑀 : There is no significant difference on the metrics M between

HGRec and R.

𝐻1𝑎,𝑀 : HGRec is significantly better than R on metrics M.
𝐻1𝑏,𝑀 : HGRec is significantly worse than R on metrics M.
where M can be ACC, MRR and RD and correspondingly, R repre-
sents one recommender introduced in Section 4.3.1.

4.3.3 Data pre-processing. Following the similar method in [12, 28],
we applied a time series strategy to evaluate the recommenders’
performance in terms of ACC, MRR and RD. To be specific, all
the reviews in 2017 were initiated as the original training set and
hereafter each monthly review until Jun, 2020 played the role of the
test set. Therefore, we eventually performed 30 rounds of evaluation
in total, as shown in Figure 4. Take the first round for example, the
first 12-month data is fed into all the recommenders and then the
data of the 13th month is used to calculate ACC, MRR and RD using
Equation 7, 8 and 9, respectively.

5 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
Following a common strategy [51, 58, 60], we compare HGRec with
other recommenders in terms of ACC, MRR and RD using top-1, top-
3 and top-5 criteria, respectively. This section presents the results
and the corresponding analysis.

5.1 Accuracy (RQ1)
Table 3 shows the performance of each recommender in terms of
ACC. The results in bold mean the best recommender regarding
ACC for a certain project. For example, HGRec performed the best
in project ‘akka’ with all the top-1, top-3 and top-5 criteria. In
general, HGRec, AC and RF performed relatively better than other
recommenders in most cases. To be specific, HGRec takes the lead
on 8 (7, 8) projects in terms of top-1 (top-3, top-5) ACC. As the
close competitors, AC wins on 2 (4,4) projects, RF leads on 2 (1,0)
projects using the same top-1, (top-3, top-5) criteria. The last row
in Table 3 lists the average ACC for all the recommenders, which
further indicates HGRec’s superiority. With all the top-1, (top-3,
top-5) criteria, HGRec produces the best average ACC. Besides,
compared with other two recommenders (i.e. CN and RARec) using
graph techniques, HGRec outperforms the others regarding ACC for
both solo project and the overall average, indicating the advantage
of hypergraph technique to model the review history. Moreover, as
the comparison basis, the ACC given by recommender RevFinder
and cHRev is not ideal, which to a fair degree is in line with other
studies [21, 35, 58]. To further test the difference, a Wilcoxon Signed
Rank Test has been conducted on ACC using the data from all the 12
projects. Note that there are 30 data points in each project according
to the experimental setting elaborated in subsection 4.3.3. Due to
page limits 3, we present the number of projects in which we are
not able to reject a certain hypothesis (i.e.,𝐻0,𝑀 , 𝐻1𝑎,𝑀 and 𝐻1𝑎,𝑀 ,
where M denotes ACC) with p-value 0.05. The results are listed
in Table 6 (the 3 columns under ACC). Take the first row as an
example, in 9 out of 12 projects, HGRec produces a significantly
better ACC than recommender RevFinder using the top-1 criteria,
meanwhile, there are 3 projects in which no significant difference
on ACC between RevFinder and HGRec has been observed. The rest
is similar, which also confirms our intuitive observation derived
from Table 3, i.e. HGRec performed the best on ACC among the
recommenders involved in this study.

MRR also measures the performance regarding recommendation
accuracy. Based on Table 4 and Table 6, we are able to observe sim-
ilar results, i.e. HGRec leads the performance on recommendation
accuracy among all the recommenders mentioned in this study.

5.2 Workload (RQ2)
Recently, researchers raise a new concern other than the accuracy of
recommenders. That is, most recommenders tend to suggest a small
group of core reviewers (i.e. the reviewers who reviewed the most
PRs in a certain project have more chance to be recommended). This
phenomenon may cause severe problems in projects with massive
PRs within a relatively short period. RD is quantified to show the
status of workload congestion.

Similarly, we also evaluated recommenders’ performance regard-
ing RD and further tested the difference using Wilcoxon Signed
Rank Test. Table 5 lists the results of RD for all the recommenders
on all the 12 projects. In general, cHRev performs the best in all the
recommenders. Meanwhile, next to cHRev, HGRec and CN present
comparable performance regarding RD. Nevertheless, cHRev and
CN showed relatively poor performance regarding ACC. A note-
worthy point is that among the best 3 recommenders regarding
ACC, HGRec outperforms the others, i.e. RF and AC by a discernible
margin. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test results listed in Table 6
also confirm these observations.

Modeling Review History for Reviewer Recommendation:
A Hypergraph Approach

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

Figure 5: Top-3 workload distributions of recommenders on project ‘angular’ (recommended reviewers in 𝑋 -axis, # PRs as-
signed to each reviewer in 𝑌 -axis)

To present an intuitive concept, take project ‘angular’ as an exam-
ple, Figure 5 shows the workload distribution resulting from diverse
recommenders based on the number of PRs in one month for project
‘angular’. Each column represents one reviewer’s workload (i.e. #
PRs assigned), the broken line represents accumulated workload on
diverse reviewers. For top-3 accurate recommenders, HGRec tends
to create a relatively balanced workload for top-10 core reviewers.
Take RF for example, the top-2 core reviewers are recommended
for reviewing 77 and 64 PRs in just one month, which might be
huge burdens for them. As a comparison, the top-2 core reviewers
are recommended by HGRec for merely 39 and 31 PRs.

The reason behind this phenomenon is that by properly tuning 𝛼
and 𝜆 in HGRec, the importance (score) for some reviewers sharing
the review experience on the same PRs has been increased, which
increases their chances to be recommended, even they may not be
active reviewers in the past.

6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Graph Technology for Recommenders
To represent relationships in a review recommendation paradigm
is a basis of a recommender. Although some graph technologies
have been adopted to model the relationships when developing
recommenders, the primary innovation in HGRec lies in the intro-
duction of hypergraph to model multiple participants involved in
one PR, which is very common in OSS projects and easy to under-
stand. Compared with the traditional recommenders that are based
on the ordinary graphs, HGRec consists of multiple vertexes and
hyperedges that can naturally model the complex high-order rela-
tionships among PRs, contributors and reviewers. Besides, HGRec

supports a flexible recommendation architecture, that is more enti-
ties and relationships, e.g., organization, comments can be involved
in HGRec if necessary.

When it comes to recommenders with similar technologies, CN
only considers simple relationships such as developer vertexes, their
interactive relationships (e.g., review activities) are formulated by
directed edges. CN suggests candidate reviewers who share com-
mon interest with contributors but neglects the PR information
itself. On the contrary, EARec includes both PR and reviewer ver-
texes, and recommends candidates by matching the characteristics
of target PR and expertise of candidates. However, EARec does not
consider the information of contributors’ internal relationships,
e.g., the social relationships, which may not be able to be directly
obtained from reviewer’s profile. HGRec systematically combines
multiple roles, including PRs’ content and interactive relationships
among the three entities (i.e. PRs, contributors and reviewers). More
importantly, HGRec is able to model the complex in an intuitive
manner close to the reality.

6.2 Model Interpretability
In recent years, AI (Artificial Intelligence )/ML (Machine Learning)
techniques are widely used in software engineering, such as soft-
ware defect prediction [22], continuous Integration prediction [59],
software defect developer recommendation [3], code reviewer rec-
ommendation [60], etc. The interpretability of AI/ML model has
naturally become the focus of these studies. According to [34], the
interpretability of AI/ML model is the degree to which a human can
understand the reasons behind a decision. For example, the model
interpretability should reflect the relationship of feature on the
outcome, the importance of each feature, the decision rule of each

feature, etc [23]. The importance of model interpretability in soft-
ware engineering is obvious since without proper understanding
towards the model, practitioners may not trust and adopt the model
in practice [47]. HGRec models the review history using hypergraph,
which explicitly includes the interaction among contributors, PRs
and reviewers. Besides, the setting of parameters directly reflects
the recommendation inclination. These characteristics of HGRec
obviously make the rationale of reviewer recommendation much
easier to be understood.

6.3 Capability to Support Future

Improvements

Hypergraph distinguishes itself not only by its straight adaption to
code review but also its architecture’s flexibility and extensibility,
which supplies a promotion for improvement in the future. For
example, due to its architecture and search strategies, CN and
EARec hardly make any adjustments. On the contrary, HGRec at this
stage has presented the advantages to model review history using
the hypergraph technique, yet it still has the capability to involve
more entities and relationships, which is worthy of exploration. For
example, potential reviewers belonging to the same organization
may share a similar background, thus impacting the weight (𝑤)
calculation. In addition, the content of review comments may bring
a new feature to characterize a PR.

To conclude, HGRec supports a flexibility to adjust diverse con-

texts and future improvements.

6.4 Recommender Selection

Figure 6: Synthetical evaluation regarding ACC and RD

We use the top-3 accuracy, a common way to evaluate recom-
menders, combined with recommendation distribution to visually
illustrate the performance of all the recommenders involved in our
study. Figure 6. presents the average ACC and RD for the 12 projects.
The advantages of HGRec are thus easy to identify, i.e. it achieves
the most accurate recommendation in all recommenders and the
best balanced workload in the top three accurate recommenders.
Nevertheless, although recommendation accuracy should be the
primary consideration in most cases (otherwise the value of rec-
ommendation will be lost), reviewer recommendation should be
applied with sufficient considerations in the application context,
which involves multiple factors such as the number of potential
reviewers, the number of PRs, etc. Take project ‘angular’ for ex-
ample (as shown in Figure 5), workload balance may not be an

Figure 7: Monthly #PRs of the 12 projects

ignorable factor since the core reviewers have already undergone
heavy review tasks. To present a general concept, we portray the
number of PRs per month for the 12 projects involved in our study,
as depicted in Figure 7. Obviously, recommendation distribution
(aka, workload balance) means more in projects such as ‘angular’,
‘joomla-cms’, etc., where there are normally hundreds of newly-
submitted PRs need to be reviewed. On the contrary, in projects
such as ‘cakephp’ and ‘scala’ where there are usually only dozens
of new PRs per month, the core two or three reviewers to handle
all the PRs may seem to be acceptable.

6.5 Threats to Validity
Several threats to validity are elaborated in this subsection.

6.5.1 Construct validity. The threats to the construct validity of
this study may be related to one of the common concerns of research
on reviewer recommendation, i.e., the ground-truth set of reviewers
for evaluation[36]. The actual reviewers recorded in review history
may not be able to guarantee “suitable reviewers” and further justify
an appropriate recommendation. In this sense, the recommended
reviewers are only potentially suitable reviewers for a certain PR.

Internal validity. The threats to the internal validity of this
6.5.2
study may result from the data preparation phase. The personal
organization of OSS projects is significantly loose, which brings
participants’ frequent turnovers and once-in-all reviews. Recom-
mending these gone or accidental reviewers is inappropriate. In
this study, we left out reviewers who had already deleted accounts
or participated in less than two reviews, so did the robot users.
On the other hand, the opening PRs were also removed as they
are uncertain. Another related threat is that some noise data (e.g.,
casual/superficial comments such as “OK”, “fine”, etc.) exists in both
the training set and test set, which may not be able to guarantee a
qualified reviewer recommendation. However, the evaluation on
HGRec and other recommenders is based on the same dataset, which
may mitigate these threats to a fair degree. Meanwhile, reviewers
who posted these casual/superficial comments may also have subtle
relationships (e.g., certain familiarity, mutual influence, etc.). There-
fore, we did not refine the dataset to remove noise data at this stage.
Instead, HGRec takes the advantage to use the possible relationships
behind the casual/superficial comments and their corresponding
reviewers.

6.5.3 External validity. We experimented with the proposed rec-
ommender on the 12 OSS projects that are retrieved from GitHub.

A Hypergraph Approach

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

However, the proposed recommender could suffer risks on external
validity, as several studies investigated other contexts, e.g., Gerrit
projects or mixed projects (both OSS and industrial projects). There-
fore, the findings and conclusions are only valid in the given context.
We have confidence that this study is representative because all the
included projects were mentioned in the previous studies and the
data is up-to-date. Besides, given the population of OSS projects
from GitHub, 12 projects tested in our study may only represent
a small portion. Nevertheless, the comparably consistent perfor-
mance (i.e., recommendation accuracy) in our study and previous
studies is able to mitigate this external threat to validity to a fair
degree.

6.5.4 Conclusion validity. To avoid threats to conclusion valid-
ity, we followed a systematic, rigorous experiment and analysis
procedure. The recommender proposed in this study has been ex-
perimented on 12 OSS projects with the history in three and a half
years, including more than 87K PRs, 680K review comments. All
the dataset is clearly elaborated (e.g., the name of projects, the time
range, etc.) and publicly accessible online. This ensures a high de-
gree of reliability that the conclusion drawn in the study is directly
traceable to the raw data and hence can be replicated by other
researchers.

7 CONCLUSIONS
With the proliferation of the pull-request development paradigm
nowadays, as a key and perhaps daily practice, Modern Code Re-
view (MCR) may impact massive software projects. While the im-
portance of suitable reviewers has been widely recognized among
OSS projects, their identification is indeed a challenge. Although
many recommenders have been proposed in the past decade, their
adoption is far from satisfactory [60]. Several critical issues such
as low accuracy, workload congestion, incapable of extension and
improvement have been raised and investigated in several related
studies.

This paper proposes HGRec, a hypergraph based recommender
to perform automatic reviewer recommendation in OSS projects.
By applying hypergraph, we managed to model high-order rela-
tionships in MCR, an essential step in OSS development. A rela-
tively extensive evaluation based on 12 OSS projects with more
than 87K PRs and 680K comments indicates that the proposed ap-
proach (i.e. HGRec) outperforms the state-of-the-art recommenders
in terms of accuracy. Moreover, among the top-3 accurate recom-
menders, HGRec is more likely to recommend new reviewers out
of core reviewers, which may help to alleviate the workload con-
gestion issue to some extent. Last but not least, with flexible and
natural model architecture, HGRec can support modeling more ele-
ments (e.g., entities, attributes and relationships) in a way that more
modern learning techniques or sophisticated heuristic algorithms
could be incorporated into the recommender. To this end, better
performance can be expected with exploration in the future.
