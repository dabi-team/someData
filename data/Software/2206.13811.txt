Abstract—  Despite  the  advantages  of  capacitive  power 
transfer (CPT), inductive power transfer (IPT) is still preferred. 
The reason: IPT systems have a gap power density in air that is 
400 times greater. Conclusively, IPT can transmit more power 
than  CPT  over  greater  distances  in  air,  but  what  about  other 
media?  This  paper  gives  an  answer  on  how  media,  different 
from air, influence the power transfer over different distances. 
First,  we  analyze  theoretically  the  capacitive  coupling  with 
different  media in the gap. Next, we simulate the CPT system 
using  finite  element  software  and  compared  it  with  the 
theoretical analysis. Finally, we employ the results of the finite 
element simulation in a power electronic simulation to examine 
the influence of the medium on the electrical power transfer.

This paper will investigate the research question: How do 
media  different  from  air  influence  the  power  transfer  of  a 
CPT  system  over  different  distances?  The  methodology  to 
investigate  this  question  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  First,  an 
analytical approach will determine the coupling and leakage 
capacitances  with  different  media.  Second,  finite  element 
simulations  will  validate  the  analytical  findings  and  yield 
more  detailed  results.  Third,  the  obtained  capacitances  for 
different  media  are  employed  in  an  electrical  simulation  of 
the  CPT  that  takes  limitations  of  present  semiconductor 
switches  into  account.  This  simulation  will  yield  the 
influence of the different media on the electrical power that 
can be transferred.  

(WPT) 

transfer 

Wireless  power 

is  an  emerging 
technology  that  enables  more  convenient,  standardised  and 
safer  systems  [1].  The  most  common  WPT  technology  is 
inductive power transfer (IPT). This technology is based on 
energy transfer with magnetic fields. It employs coils at the 
primary  and  secondary  side.  Another  WPT  technology  is 
capacitive power transfer (CPT). Here, energy is transferred 
via  electric  fields  between  metal  plates  at  primary  and 
secondary side [1]. Compared to IPT, CPT has the advantages 
of being cost effective, it does not bear transmission losses in 
the vicinity of metal objects and emits fewer EM disturbances 
[1]–[3]. 

Fig. 1: Implemented methodology 

An important performance criterion of WPT is gap power 
density. The gap power density of IPT is 400 times greater 
than CPT with air as a medium [4]. This results in IPT being 
able to transmit higher powers over longer distances. For this 
reason,  IPT  is  generally  preferred  over  CPT  for  energy 
transfer  through  air.  However,  considering  other  solid  or 
liquid media in the gap can be in favour of CPT technology. 
Also, CPT can become feasible in applications where IPT is 
limited by core materials [4].

II.  CAPACITIVE COUPLING 

A  CPT  system  is  commonly  composed  of  two  parallel 
pairs of metal plates with a medium between them, as shown 
in  Fig.  2.  A  more  detailed  schematic  equivalent  circuit 
representation of this so-called four-plate structure is given in 
Fig. 3. The system consists of a pair main coupling capacitors 
(C13  &  C24),  two  leakage  capacitors  (C12  &  C34)  and  two 
cross-coupling capacitors (C14 & C23).  

Fig. 3: Four-plate structure with main, leakage and cross-coupling 
capacitances 

The  size  of  these  capacitances,  especially  the  main 
capacitance, is determined by the surface of the plates (A), the 
distance between the plates (d) and the dielectric constant of

capacitance can be calculated as follows: 

The materials used in this analytical comparison are listed in 
Table 1 with their dielectric constants.

The  parasitic  capacitances  (C12,  C14,  C23,  C34)  are 
unpractical to determine by analytical calculations. Therefore, 
the  parasitic  capacitances  can  either  neglected  in  analytical 
calculations  or  determined  by  means  of  finite  element 
simulations. These simulations use a Pi-model as in  Fig.  4. 
This  schematic  is  easier  to  handle  than  the  one  in  Fig.  3 
[5], [6]. The primary (CP), secondary (CS) and mutual (CM) 
capacitance than can be calculated as [1], [5], [6]:

In present literature, CPT is often presented with air as the 
only  medium  between  plates  [7]–[9].  This  is  presumably 
because CPT has been seen as an alternative to IPT, which 
already  has  many  application  areas  where  air  serves  as  the 
medium. However, if another medium  increases the energy 
transfer  in  CPT,  this  could  open  up  new  application  areas 
where IPT is less  viable [10].  

Previous studies have shown that the electrical power that 
can  be  transferred,  depends  on  the  size  of  the  coupling 
capacitance  [2],  [8].  In  theory,  the  greater  the  coupling 
capacitance,  the  greater  the  power  that  can  be  transmitted. 
Considering  (  1  ),  the  total  capacity  can  be  increased  by 
selecting a medium with a large dielectric constant. For this 
reason,  media  such  as  water,  insulation  material,  glass  or 
concrete allow for greater electrical power to be transferred 
than air [11]–[16]. Their dielectric constants are namely 3 to 
80 times greater.

III.  THEORETICAL ANALYSIS 

the  power 

The capacitances C13 & C24 of the plate structure in Fig. 3 
establish 
transfer.  These  capacitances  are 
calculated  taking  the  geometry  and  medium  into  account 
using ( 1 ). First, parasitic capacities are neglected here and 
the capacitive coupling factor ke is assumed to be one. This 
means that the primary (CP), secondary (CS) and mutual (CM) 
capacity  in  the  Pi-model  of  Fig.  4  equal  half  the  main 
capacitance [1], [2], [6]. In this paper, mutual capacity CM is 
used  to  compare  different  mediums  as  a  larger  CM  means 
higher power transfer [8].  

For  a  square  plate  surface  with  side  x  equal  to  30 cm, 
altering the distance from 1 mm to 20 cm, Fig. 5 shows the 
resulting capacitance CM for six different materials in the gap.

A first finding here is that the resulting  CM with water as a 
medium  is  much  higher,  80  times  according  to  dielectric 
constant,  than  in  air.  Even  typical  building  materials  like 
glass  or  rockwool  lead  to  a  significantly  higher  resulting 
capacitance, 3 to 8 times greater at a distance of 10 mm. In 
the  next  section,  we  will  extend  the  investigation  with 
parasitic capacitances using finite element simulation.

IV.  SIMULATION RESULTS 

A.  Coupling capacitance 

In  order  to  take  into  account  the  leakage  and  cross-
coupling  capacitances,  a  finite  element  simulation  software 
such as CST Studio Suite is required. The simulation model, 
as in Fig. 6, is based on the same parameters of the analytical 
calculations in Fig. 3. The model has a symmetric capacitance 
matrix as output.

The self-capacitances of the plates (C11, C22, C33, C44) are 
listed  at  the  diagonal  of  the  matrix  C  in  (  5  ).  Those  are 
neglected  in  this  paper  because  the  distance  between  the 
plates is much smaller than the distance between the plates 
and their reference at infinity [17]. Furthermore, the fringing 
fields,  the  electrical  conductivity  of  the  medium,  the 
equivalent  series  resistance  and  the  equivalent  series 
inductance  of  the  capacitive  coupling  are  not  taken  into 
account in these finite element simulations.

allows CPT to transfer 1 kW over 3 to 4 mm while in air such 
a power is not even possible at 1 mm.

For  the  described  CPT  system,  the  resulting  mutual 
capacitances  CM  are  presented  in  Fig.  5  by  dashed  lines. 
These  simulations  included  the  leakage  and  cross-coupling 
capacitances. 

For  a  distance  up  to  25 mm,  the  simulation  results  are 
about 15 % higher than the analytical calculations. This can 
be  explained  by  the  maximum  accuracy  of  the  simulation 
program of one picofarad. After 25 mm, the values become 
significantly smaller due to the influence of the leakage and 
cross-coupling capacitance, which can be found in the values 
of  the  capacitive  coupling  coefficient  in  Fig.  7.  Due  to  the 
maximum accuracy of the simulation program, the coupling 
coefficient around a distance of 25 mm, is slightly higher than 
one.  

The capacitive coupling coefficient of water drops faster 
than  the  coefficient  of  air.  The  advantage  of  the  high 
permittivity,  becomes  a  disadvantage:  cross-coupling  and 
the  coupling

the secondary side and deteriorates efficiency of the system 
[2],[6].  In  the  next  section  we  will  employ  the  calculated 
coupling  capacitances  in  an  electrical  circuit  simulation  to 
quantify their effect on the transferrable electrical power.

A.  Power electronic simulations 

In  a  power  electronic  simulation,  the  optimum  power 
transfer  is determined  for different  media. We make use  of 
the software PLECS. The simulated circuit is shown in Fig. 
8. A resonator circuit is used with one inductor in series with 
the  coupling  capacitors.  The  latter  model  the  capacitive 
coupling. This resonator circuit reaches a gain of one when 
the system is operating at the resonance frequency. Therefore, 
for  each  simulation  the  resonance  will  be  calculated 
according to ( 6 ) where LP is the primary inductor and C is 
the  total  capacitance  of  the  system.  When  the  calculated 

Fig. 9: Influence of a medium on the output power at resonance 
frequency 

According  to  these  simulations,  the  medium  affects  the 
resonant  frequency  and  thus  the  resulting  power  output. 
Media with a high dielectric constant allow higher powers to 
be transmitted over a greater distance. This is demonstrated 
by  water  and  glass  in  Fig.  9.  CPT  in  water  and  glass  each 
reach a maximum power output of approximately 2 kW while 
the  maximum  power  output  in  air  is  only  500 W.  This 
maximum  power  is  achieved  when  the  impedance  of  the 
resonator circuit is at its lowest. For water and glass there is 
a  difference  in  the  distance  at  which  this  maximum  power 
was  reached,  namely  for  glass  this  maximum  power  was 
reached  at  1 mm  while  in  water  this  maximum  power  was 
reached at 11 mm at a lower frequency. The lower frequency 
makes it possible to transmit power over greater distance, up 
to  20 cm  in  water,  despite  the  limitation  of  a  maximum 
resonant frequency of 1 MHz. An additional benefit of having 
a  lower  resonant  frequency  is  that  switching  losses  will  be

reduced. The resonant frequency for the system in water was 
throughout all simulations 9 to 12 times smaller than in air.  

CONCLUSION 

During  the  analytical  calculations  it  was  found,  as 
expected, that a medium with a larger dielectric constant than 
air can have a positive influence on the coupling capacitance.  
This was further supported by the finite element simulations 
in which parasitic capacitances were also taken into account. 
Based  on  these  simulations,  the  capacitive  coupling  of 
capacitive  power  transfer  system  with  single  resonator  was 
simulated. The simulations demonstrated that a medium with 
a high dielectric constant can ensure  higher transmit power 
over greater distances at lower frequencies. For example, in 
these simulations glass allows CPT to transfer 1 kW over 3 to 
4 mm while in air only 500 W can be reached at 1 mm. 

In the future, this research should be extended by taking 
into account the fringing fields, electrical conductivity of the 
medium, the equivalent series resistance and the equivalent 
series inductance of the capacitive coupling. Furthermore, a 
more detailed modelling of the power converter topology is 
needed  and  possible  applications  must  be  identified  and 
simulated. Finally, the results should be validated in the lab.
