ABSTRACT

There is an urgent need for streamlining radiology Quality Assurance (QA) programs to make them better and

faster. Here, we present a novel approach, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)-Based Quality Assurance by Restricted

Investigation of Unequal Scores (AQUARIUS), for re-deﬁning radiology QA, which reduces human eﬀort by up

to several orders of magnitude over existing approaches. AQUARIUS typically includes automatic comparison

of AI-based image analysis with natural language processing (NLP) on radiology reports. Only the usually small

subset of cases with discordant reads is subsequently reviewed by human experts. To demonstrate the clinical

applicability of AQUARIUS, we performed a clinical QA study on Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection

in 1936 head CT scans from a large academic hospital. Immediately following image acquisition, scans were

automatically analyzed for ICH using a commercially available software (Aidoc, Tel Aviv, Israel). Cases rated

positive for ICH by AI (ICH-AI+) were automatically ﬂagged in radiologists’ reading worklists, where ﬂagging

was randomly switched oﬀ with probability 50%. Using AQUARIUS with NLP on ﬁnal radiology reports and

targeted expert neuroradiology review of only 29 discordantly classiﬁed cases reduced the human QA eﬀort by

98.5%, where we found a total of six non-reported true ICH+ cases, with radiologists’ missed ICH detection

rates of 0.52% and 2.5% for ﬂagged and non-ﬂagged cases, respectively. We conclude that AQUARIUS, by

combining AI-based image analysis with NLP-based pre-selection of cases for targeted human expert review, can

eﬃciently identify missed ﬁndings in radiology studies and signiﬁcantly expedite radiology QA programs in a

hybrid human-machine interoperability approach.

1. MOTIVATION

The provision of high-quality health care is the goal of all medical services. In the case of radiology quality

assurance (QA) programs, patient selection, the conduct of the examination, and the interpretation of the

results can all have an impact on the achievement of this goal, such as by improving the diagnostic information

content, reducing radiation exposure, reducing medical costs, and improving departmental management [1]. QA

programs thus contribute to the provision of high-quality health care.

Speciﬁcally, QA programs in radiology are of immense value in improving patient safety, optimizing the

clinical usefulness of medical imaging exams, and increasing ﬁnancial proﬁts of radiology practices by lowering

operational costs. Yet, contemporary approaches to radiology QA, such as widely used methods of randomly

selecting cases for human review, suﬀer from limited eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency. Hence, there is an urgent

need for streamlining radiology QA programs to make them better and faster. Here, we present a novel hybrid

human-machine interoperability approach, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)-Based Quality Assurance by Restricted

Investigation of Unequal Scores (AQUARIUS), for re-deﬁning radiology QA, which has the potential of reducing

human QA eﬀort by several orders of magnitude over existing approaches.

In the following, we will explain the basic idea of AQUARIUS, describe its clinical application within a

retrospective clinical trial for QA in AI-based detection of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) in emergent care head

CT scans, and will report initial radiology QA results for this clinical application.

This work is embedded in our group’s endeavor to expedite artiﬁcial intelligence in biomedical imaging by means

of advanced pattern recognition and machine learning methods for computational radiology and radiomics, e.g.,

[2–75].

2. METHODOLOGIC CONCEPT

2.1 Shortcomings of Current Approaches to Radiology QA

The potential of conventional approaches to radiology QA is limited and subject to manifold shortcomings.

A typical scenario for contemporary QA-related analysis would be to randomly select cases for human expert

review, where medical imaging studies are compared with the ﬁndings described in the associated radiology re-

ports. Although the scope of the analysis can be restricted to speciﬁc imaging study subsets, such as originating

from given pre-deﬁned radiology practices, scanners, imaging modalities, radiology exam types, patient origin

(inpatient, outpatient, or emergency department), speciﬁc referring physicians, etc., the principal challenge re-

mains the same, namely a lack of focus by not pre-selecting cases with a high ‘pre-test’ probability of discordant

interpretation based on image content. A classic example are ‘peer-review’ approaches, such as the American

College of Radiology (ACR) RADPEERTM program [76], which restricts QA to cases with existing prior imag-

ing studies. This program starts from the assumption that if, during interpretation of a new examination, there

are prior images of the same area of interest, the interpreting radiologist will typically form an opinion of the

previous interpretation while interpreting the new study. If the opinion of the previous interpretation is scored, a

peer review event has occurred, where the reviewer scores the previous interpretation using a standardized rating

scale. This approach requires signiﬁcant human eﬀort, excludes studies with no prior exams, does not distinguish

between high and low ‘pre-test’ probability for discordant reads, so that only a tiny subset of inaccurate inter-

pretations may be detected, given the usually low probability of clinically relevant discordant interpretations. In

practice, most of the reviewed studies will be rated as ACR category 1 signifying a concordant read. This involves

the issue of vigilance fatigue for rare events, e.g., [77], as known from non-medical domains, such as policing [78]

or airport security, where the underlying probability of alert-inducing events is usually low. Case selection is

usually based on a random approach, such as automatically requesting peer review for a certain number of cases

(typically two) at the beginning of a radiologist’s shift, which will preclude the majority of inaccurate interpre-

tations from being detected in the peer review process. In addition, such a peer-review approach does not only

require human intervention by the original peer-reviewing radiologist, but also signiﬁcant time and eﬀort by a

second human reviewer that performs a secondary review of cases with peer-review scores indicating discordant

reads between current and prior studies. In conclusion, despite requiring a signiﬁcant amount of human expert

intervention time and eﬀort, the vast majority of inaccurate radiology interpretations will remain undetected

under the currently used radiology QA approaches. Hence, there is an urgent need to make the radiology QA

process better and faster, with the goal to both improve patient safety and reduce costs

2.2 Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)-Based Quality Assurance by Restricted Investigation of

Unequal Scores (AQUARIUS)

AQUARIUS consists of two steps: In a ﬁrst step, AI-based case analysis is compared to a ‘gold standard’ given

by an automatically retrieved estimate of human case assessment. In a second step, cases with “unequal scores”,

i.e., discordant assessments between AI-based and human interpretation, are reviewed by human experts. A typ-

ical diagnostic radiology implementation of AQUARIUS would include automatic comparison of AI-based image

analysis results with natural language processing (NLP) results on ﬁnal radiology reports. Only the usually small

subset of cases with discordant reads would then be manually reviewed by dedicated subspecialty-trained expert

radiologists. By restricting human eﬀort to only those cases with a high ‘pre-test’ probability for missed or over-

called ﬁndings, AQUARIUS optimizes the use of human and ﬁscal resources spent on radiology QA programs,

thus demonstrating a signiﬁcant potential for both ‘saving lives’ and ‘saving money’ simultaneously. We em-

phasize that multiple organizational and technical challenges have to be met simultaneously for implementing a

successful AQUARIUS study design. These challenges include, but are not limited to, (i) acquiring Institutional

Review Board approval for automatic data retreival and radiologists’ participation in such QA initiatives, (ii)

aligning the interests of diverse stakeholders, including radiologists, hospital administrators, AI solution vendors,

and regulatory bodies, such as the ACR, and (iii) signiﬁcant interface programming eﬀorts for automatically re-

trieving heterogeneous information from multiple radiology and hospital IT systems, such as AI-based image

analysis results and NLP-based classiﬁcation of radiology reports for relevant clinical imaging ﬁndings.

3. CLINICAL APPLICATION: INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE DETECTION

TRIAL

Clinical Relevance: To demonstrate the applicability of our novel hybrid human-AI quality assurance (QA)

approach using the AQUARIUS framework, we performed a study for evaluating radiologists’ performance on

accurately reporting intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in emergent care setting head CT scans. Timely detection

of ICH on medical imaging studies is critical, because delayed therapeutic interventions in emergency settings

may be detrimental for patient outcome. For example, in hemorrhagic stroke, the American Heart Association

(AHA)/American Stroke Association (ASA) 2018 guidelines for early management emphasize the time-dependent

beneﬁt of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy [79]. Patients with ischemic stroke must be identiﬁed as

soon as possible so that tPA can be administered within 3-4.5 hours of symptom onset [79]. A non-contrast head

CT scan, which must be negative for hemorrhage, is a required diagnostic test before tPA can be administered

in a timely manner [80–82]. The clinical outcomes of patients receiving tPA within a designated time limit

are closely linked to time of treatment [82, 83]. Besides hemorrhagic stroke, there are numerous other clinical

conditions, in which ICH will lead to rapid increase of intracranial pressure, where early detection and treatment

of ICH can signiﬁcantly reduce patient morbidity and mortality.

Data and Methods: A total of 1936 consecutive non-contrast emergency-setting head CT scans from 2 CT

scanners at a large academic hospital were prospectively acquired over 47 consecutive days. Immediately following

image acquisition, scans were automatically analyzed for ICH using commercially available software (Aidoc, Tel

Aviv, Israel). Cases rated positive for ICH by AI (ICH-AI+) were automatically ﬂagged in radiologists’ reading

worklists, where ﬂagging was randomly switched oﬀ with probability 50%, see e.g.

[84]. For ICH-AI+ cases,

radiologists’ missed ICH detection rates (ratio of number of missed ICH cases and number of all true ICH-AI+

cases) was calculated and compared between ﬂagged and non-ﬂagged ICH-AI+ cases, where images of all ICH-

AI+ cases with ICH-negative results detected by natural language processing (NLP) of ﬁnal radiology reports

(ICH-AI+NLP- cases) were re-analyzed by an experienced neuroradiologist to identify true ICH+ cases missed

by original radiology readings.

4. RESULTS

Among all 1936 CT scans, 381 ICH-AI+ cases were found, of which 190 cases were ﬂagged. A total of 29

ICH-AI+NLP- cases were found, where 6 had been reported ICH+ by the radiology report. Of the remaining

non-reported 23 ICH-AI+ cases, neuroradiology expert review identiﬁed 6 non-reported true ICH+ cases, where

5 cases were non-ﬂagged, and only 1 case was ﬂagged. This yields radiologists’ missed ICH detection rates of

0.52% and 2.5% for ﬂagged and nonﬂagged cases, respectively.

5. CONCLUSIONS

We present a novel hybrid human-machine interoperability approach, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)-Based Quality

Assurance by Restricted Investigation of Unequal Scores (AQUARIUS), for re-deﬁning radiology QA, which

has the potential of reducing human QA eﬀort by several orders of magnitude over existing approaches, making

radiology QA programs better and faster. AQUARIUS consists of two steps: In a ﬁrst step, AI-based case anal-

ysis is compared to a ‘gold standard’ given by an automatically retrieved estimate of human case assessment. In

a second step, cases with “unequal scores”, i.e., discordant assessments between AI-based and human interpre-

tation, are reviewed by human experts. In our initial clinical study on detecting QA for detecting Intracranial

Hemorrhage (ICH) on emergent noncontrast head CT scans, our results suggest that ﬂagging ICH-AI+ cases on

radiologists’ worklists may decrease the rate of missed true ICH+ cases, although this was not found statistically

signiﬁcant based on small numbers of discordantly reported cases. Yet, our novel method of human expert review

of ICH-AI+NLP- cases successfully revealed true ICH+ cases missed by original radiology reports with minimum

human eﬀort, and can therefore provide valuable contributions to radiology QA programs as an eﬃcient hybrid

human-AI approach. We conclude that, by combining AI image analysis with NLP-based pre-selection of cases

for targeted human expert review, our AQUARIUS approach can eﬃciently identify missed ﬁndings in radiology

reports and thus expedite radiology QA programs.
