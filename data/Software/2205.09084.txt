Abstract—Industry 5.0 vision, a step toward the next industrial
revolution and enhancement to Industry 4.0, envisioned the new
goals of resilient, sustainable, and human-centric approaches
in diverse emerging applications, e.g., factories-of-the-future,
digital society. The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence
and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efﬁcient, and reliable
cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-
defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions.
However,
the vision requires the merging of cyber-physical
worlds through utilizing Industry 5.0 technological enablers, e.g.,
cognitive cobots, person-centric artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), cyber-
physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage
and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In
this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational
intelligence (CI) paradigm and next-generation wireless networks
(NGWNs) can fulﬁll the stringent communication and computa-
tion requirements of the technological enablers in the Industry
5.0 vision, which is the aim of this survey-based tutorial. In
this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyz-
ing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools
and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access
networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling
services, and others, essential for designing the objectives of CI-
NGWNs to fulﬁll the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Finally,
we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review,
research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in
CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.

and computation requirements of Industry 5.0 applications
and services [1]. which are based on three core elements;
resilience, sustainability, and human-centric industry [2]. Re-
silience refers to the increase in industrial production while
reducing the disruptions and times of crisis. The sustainability
mainly addresses environmental factors, such as energy reduc-
tion and reuse of the available resources. The human-centric
approach places the human interests and needs at the core of
the production process, including personalization and machine
interaction. Concerning the core elements of Industry 5.0, vital
communication and computation paradigm components and
their subdivision in NGWNs1 are illustrated in Fig. 1.
NextG Wireless Networks (NGWNs). Lately, with the de-
ployment of 5G networks, a broad spectrum of research is
being carried out to envision next-generation wireless net-
works or 6G wireless systems— closely integrating the om-
nipresent AI into every aspect of networking systems to enable
hyper-ﬂexible intelligent end-to-end (E2E) networking archi-
tecture [3]–[5]. Primary goals include the 1) AI-native service-
oriented architecture that possesses the inherent features of
ﬂexible and enhanced service-based architecture (SBA) to
provide hybrid 6G services, 2) high data-transportation and
computation networks, and 3) support for knowledgeable
and autonomous human-centric systems. In this regard, CI
integration can play a big part in realizing the 6G vision.
Computational Intelligence (CI) paradigm provides intel-
ligent communication, computation, and functional storage
capabilities to numerous applications by utilizing [6]–[8],
1) state-of-the-art computational algorithms, e.g., deep neu-
ral networks, fuzzy systems, evolutionary AI, and swarm

AI, 2) hyperconverged computing infrastructure (HCI), e.g.,
cloud/edge computing infrastructure, on-premise private data
centers, public data lakes, and 3) enabling communication
technologies, e.g., NG-IoT and IIoT, cognitive CPS systems,
B5G/6G wireless systems. The International Data Corporation
(IDC) estimates the global spending on AI will increase from
85.3 billion US$ in 2021 to over 204 US billion US$ in
2025 [9].
CI-native NextG Wireless Networks (CI-NGWNs). A new
concept of CI-native NGWNs is emerging following the con-
vergence of CI paradigms, SDN- and NFV-enabled commu-
nication networks, coupled with softwarized service architec-
tures (i.e., microservices architectures), which can provide the
powerful integrated solution to sustain the needs of Industry
5.0 vision [1], [10]. It enables fully automated and intelli-
gent network resource management and operations to deploy
dynamic network functions and connection services, which
provides a high degree of ﬂexibility in numerous demanding
scenarios [11]–[13], e.g., 1) integrated network softwarization,
2) AI-native service-based architecture, 3) multi-tenancy and
service orchestrations, 4) self-sustainable zero-touch networks,
5) O-RAN architecture, 6) DT implementation for human-
machine interaction, and 7) time-sensitive networks (TSN).
Industry 5.0 and CI-NGWNs. The ﬁfth industrial revolution
powered by enabling communication and computation tech-
nologies paves the way for new opportunities for ﬁrms to
create value for their customers. In this respect, CI-NGWNs
unlock new business model opportunities for ﬁrms to create
and capture value from this technology. However, it requires
all actors (e.g., leading telecom and vertical industries) to
collaborate towards realizing the economic impact that would
give everyone involved a fair return on their investments.

2

Furthermore, understanding customer needs (i.e., connectivity
requirements) is a prerequisite to understanding successful
value creation and capturing. Therefore, the real value of CI-
NGWNs is deﬁned by improving the manufacturing processes
in terms of their responsiveness to the demand, efﬁciency,
capacity utilization, and product/service customization and
it
innovation requirements in Industry 5.0. In this sense,
requires the human- and value-centric design of CI-NGWNs
through verticals-technology joint design to enable the actual
realization and adaptation of Industry 5.0 goals.

II. THE RISE OF INDUSTRY 5.0 VISION

Transition towards Industry 5.0 The world is experiencing
the fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, one of the
future projects that the German government outlined in its
2010 ”High-Tech Strategy 2020” action plan. [14], [15]. The
end goal was to enhance digitization in smart production and
bring automated control under the vision of mass production,
like in the preceding three industrial revolutions [16]. How-
ever, one of the key differences among different revolutions
lies in utilizing the state-of-the-art enabling technologies of
the respective age (as illustrated in Fig. 2), e.g., the intro-
duction of diverse ICT technologies facilitates the migration
from electronics-based Industry 3.0 to the vision of Industry
4.0 [17]. Hence,
the digitized revolution of Industry 4.0
reshapes today’s industries by increasing the efﬁciency and
intelligence in manufacturing and automation processes [18].
Lately, academia and researchers have started to discuss the
futuristic visions for the next industrial revolution or Industry
5.0— an evolution and logical continuation that complements
the existing Industry 4.0 paradigm.
Industry 5.0 Visions. Industry 5.0 aims for mass customized
production with zero waste, minimum cost and maximum
accuracy while a critical component
in Industry 4.0 was
mass production with minimum wastage and enhanced efﬁ-
ciency [2], [19]. However, the Industry 5.0 concept is yet
entirely to be evolved. For example, [2, Sec. II] discusses
the various deﬁnitions and observations of leading industry
researchers and practitioners regarding the Industry 5.0 vision.
All relevant Industry 5.0 concepts emphasize humans and
robots working in harmony to create an intelligent society
where humans perform the creative tasks of innovation while
robots (cobots) carry out the rest. In this regard, European
Commission (EC) coined the futuristics blueprints to add
resiliency, human-centering, and sustainable approaches to the
industry 5.0 vision [20]–[22]. It enables people empowerment
(i.e., workforce, digital society) in nexus with the goals of
mass-customization in optimized supply chains, e.g., adapt-
ability and scalable product varieties, bringing positive impacts
and beneﬁts for different ﬁelds of society and realizing the next
industrial revolution (c.f. Fig. 2).
Why Industry 5.0. The industries of the future need to play
a functional part in equipping solutions to imminent societal
challenges [23]–[25], e.g., 1) preserving environmental and
natural resources and climate change (sustainability), 2) cir-
cular production models, emerging enabling ICT technologies,
and revision of policies for energy consumption for efﬁcient

utilization of natural resources in the event of external shocks,
e.g., Covid-19 pandemic (resiliency), and 3) digital hypercon-
nectivity and evolving digital skills for people empowerment
and social stability (human-centric value). It is imperative
for Industry 5.0 vision components to realize and enable the
17 goals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) or
Global Goals outlined in Agenda 2030 of the United Nations
(UN) [26].

Building blocks of Industry 5.0. In the face of imminent
societal challenges, FoFs in Industry 5.0 can provide inno-
vative solutions via the integration of current and emerging
technologies and techniques. Notably, there have been sig-
niﬁcant advancements in various emerging technologies, e.g.,
robotics [27], IIoT [28], computer vision (CV) [29], big data
analytics and computation technologies [30], B5G wireless
intelligence (AI) [32], which
networks [31], and artiﬁcial
enable the new vertical and horizontal
industrial applica-
tions. Some promising examples/applications of an upcoming
changing trend are cloud manufacturing, the deployment of
artiﬁcial-, virtual-, and extended-reality (AR-VR-XR) in mesh-
connected digital twins (DTs) of factory, supply chain manage-
ment, DT-enabled cobots, automated guided vehicles (AGVs),
predictive maintenance, intelligent healthcare, and smart edu-
cation [20]. It is not long before humans will start interacting
closely with AI- and DT-enabled cobots systems and machines
inside the FoFs. Additionally, Industry 5.0 brings the other
critical features to the existing Industry 4.0 paradigm. For
example, Matrix Production, based on grid-layout categorized
and standardized manufacturing cells, combines the concepts
of cell manufacturing [33], lean productions [34], cell-neutral
and smart wireless networked multirobot systems [18], and
AGVs [35]. It enables hyper customization and discards the
monolithic rigid production by decoupling the warehouse
logistics and manufacturing ﬂoor production and using the
control software to connect multiple manufacturing cells in
matrix grids for sustainable, ﬂexible, resilient and customized

the same situation while searching for industrial IoT, zero-

and other relevant data. We applied the detailed pre-processing
check based on screening procedures and excluded articles of
this sort from the ﬁnal database of literature for our survey

already become critical
topics in academia and industry
(c.f. Sec. I and II). We read through all the incorporated
papers in our collected literature database, obtained through
the aforementioned screening methodology.
Literature Review and Limitations. Many research works
are published on Industry 5.0 and CI-NGWNs, vision, enabling
technologies, possible applications, and use cases. In this

regard, we categorized and summarized some of the available
literature and reviewed works in Table III, based on the critical
enabling features of CI-NGWNs and its compliance with the
Industry 5.0 vision. We tried to ﬁnd the common grounds and
proposition towards the nexus of Industry 5.0 and CI-NGWNs,
especially how CI-NGWNs can act as a technological enabler
for realizing the Industry 5.0 vision. From Table III, it is
observed that all authors have explored Industry 5.0 with
a different perspective, for which we gave the summarized
remarks and marked the nature of discussion in reviewed
literature on the basis of covering the CI-NGWNs feature cov-
erage, i.e., High Coverage, Medium Coverage, Low Coverage
and Unavailable. From literature review content, it has been
revealed that there has been limitation of less coverage of
the Industry 5.0 vision concerning numerous features of CI

and NextG wireless networks, i.e., O-RAN, softwarized NIBs,
service provisioning, cloud/edge-native computing network
architecture and others. For example, Nayak et al., and Bhat et
al., in [58] and [52], respectively, reviewed the various features
relevant to some of CI techniques and applications in 6G
vision, while Shahzadi et al., in [51] has addressed the human-
centric features in futuristic 6G. Similarly, fewer attempts have
been made to identify and cover the KPIs of three pillars of
Industry 5.0 vision (i.e., sustainability, resilience, and human-
centric) and how various critical features of CI-NWGNs can
meet these KPIs requirements.

Based on the facts mentioned above, CI-NWGNs is ex-
pected to open up novel opportunities for Industry 5.0 research
and development as a critical technological enabler in the
foreseeable future.

III. TECHNOLOGICAL ENABLERS OF INDUSTRY 5.0
VISION AND HOW CI-NGWNS KPIS SUPPORT IT

The optimization and/or expansion of existing Industry 4.0
application requirements (e.g., extended coverage, enhanced
features) and new vertical and advanced applications in In-
dustry 5.0 incurs enhanced communication and computation
service requirements. In this section, we ﬁrst discuss the
critical technological enablers to realize the Industry 5.0 vision
(Sec. III-A), followed by the enhanced KPIs of CI-NGWNs
that can facilitate the required technological enablers needed
for the Industry 5.0 vision (Sec. III-B).

A. Required Technological Enablers

The industry 5.0 enabling technologies are multiple complex
systems resulting from seamless convergence of emerging
technologies and paradigms that bind physical and cyberspaces
to realize the vision (c.f. Fig. 3). The successful working
symbiotic relationship between multiple complex systems and
supporting technological frameworks in tandem can only en-
able the true multi-dimensional potential of the Industry 5.0
features [21], [22]. These industry 5.0 technological enablers
are,

1) Human-Machine Interaction: Human-machine interac-
tion technologies can enable the hyperconnectivity between
machines and humans to provide human-centric innovation,
solutions, and intelligence, e.g., cognitive and affective com-
puting, digital assistance, visual insights, smart management,
and control. Following enabling technologies supports human-
centric value design in Industry 5.0.
Cognitive and Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CCPSS) is
a rapidly growing interdisciplinary technology that combines
cognitive computing architecture at the nexus of three critical
spaces of machine/cobots to deliver intelligent solutions [68].
These three crucial cobots spaces are cyber, physical, and
counterpart social (human) components for enabling human-
machine interaction. By integrating machine learning and
artiﬁcial intelligence with brain-inspired Affective computing
designs, CCPSS uniquely combines the best of both worlds
through human intelligence to aid the Industry 5.0 vision [69].
Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR). By combining AMRs
with AGVs, multidirectional production lines can be laid out
instead of the linear layout possible with conventional con-
veyors [70], [71]. It understands the surrounding environment
in matrix productions [36]. In the plant and between the
warehouses and loading bays, AMRs ensure the movement
of components inside and among work cells. Several of the

processing tasks related to AMRs, including collision avoid-
ance and visual navigation, are migrated to the on-premises
cloud/edge.
Augmented Reality Technologies, integrates virtual informa-
tion with the real world to provide computer-generated percep-
tual information, e.g., AR-VR-XR [72], [73]. The technical
uses include multimedia, 3D-modelling, real-time intelligent
interaction, sensing, visual insights, and more.
Cognitive Service Provisioning. Cognitive service provi-
sioning provides the customized standalone services to meet
the service demands of previously discussed human-centric
applications [74]–[76], such as 1) tracking technologies, e.g.,
real-time monitoring of industrial workforce, navigational sup-
port to AMRs, 2) multi-lingual support for natural language
processing (NLP) applications, 3) CV for human cognitive
abilities, e.g., gesture recognition, pattern recognition and 4)
cognitive APIs for CCPSS-based cobots.

2) Real-time Virtual Simulation and Digital Twin: Digital
twin technology implementation enables the real-time cyber
world through creating a virtual/digital images of counterpart
physical assets, which can be devices, process, sensors, etc. DT
technology realizes following critical two functional aspects.
DT of Physical Assets and Process Optimization. By
bridging the physical and cyber world, DT models the en-
tire complex system comprised of deployed industrial assets,
enabling them to communicate and interact intelligently to
take action and optimize the multi-fold value of the output
production process [77], [78]. Together with IIoT and CPS, DT
can facilitate this true digital hyperconnectivity in FoFs [8].
It allows the remote maintenance and predictive maintenance
paradigms inside the factory ecosystems [79]. Similarly, mas-
sive interconnected DT systems integrated with augmented

technologies can efﬁciently utilize human intelligence for
management and control purposes [80].
Virtual Simulation and Modelling. DT provides visualization
access to multi-scale and multi-dimensional dynamic modeling
of factory processes, machine parts, and other complex sys-
tems [81]. Based on the digital images, 3D virtual simulation
can be implemented to check the ﬁnal outputs of factory
operations and test new products. Hence, it results in the estab-
lishment of operational safety for human-centric purposes be-
fore machines or complex factory systems deployments [82].
Similarly, virtual simulations of the green environmental and
social impacts of deployed systems can be carried out to
take measurements for designing and maintaining value-based
production policies.

3) Artiﬁcial Intelligence-native Smart Systems: AI-native
smart functions can identify and predict the incoming causal-
ities in complex and dynamic industrial assets, e.g., cobots,
factory processes, worker’s conditions, critical events, which
leads to necessary automated actions. For Industry 5.0 vision,
AI-native systems need to possess the following characteris-
tics.
Required AI Systems Features. The AI-based innovative sys-
tem gives the ability to intelligently cater to unexpected critical
events fully autonomous and without human intervention [83].
However, the problem resides in traditional AI system since
they only function and operate with past historical data [84].
In a real-world scenario, the data is relatively less, and data
quality varies. Moreover, the time-series spatial data has a
lot of complex statistical cross-correlations among numerous
dependent variables, which vary drastically with the hetero-
geneous data sources, and interrelated dynamic and random
systems [85]. Similarly, state-of-the-art DNN algorithms, i.e.,

rent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based
algorithms, are typically used to capture the complex corre-
lations in past historical time-series data. It is noted that not
always past correlation holds out same in the future because
of additional causal relationships within the observed data
variables, which affects the future prediction. In such cases,
causal AI can capture the essence of causality and complex
correlations to adopt intelligent choices and actions through
integrating human-decision making and reasoning [86].
Individual and Person-centric AI, a human-centred AI
system that focuses on AI algorithms that emerge from
continuous human inputs and collaboration learning from
human insights [87]. Human-centered AI regards continuous
improvements through human input, enables explainable AI
paradigms [88], while allowing humans and cobots to work
together in practical ways, e.g., CCPPS systems [89], [90].
For example, AI-driven informed algorithms, such as data-
driven physics-informed models, are able to learn from in-
coming data and mathematical physics models. They emulate
brain learning, even in unclear, high-dimensional, and partially
understood scenarios [88].
Secure and Energy-Efﬁcient AI. Data has an integral part
in realizing the potential of AI systems. Generally, centralized
cloud or private on-premise database resources are utilized to
perform computations relevant to the AI learning process [91].
In the cloud, distributed computation-based AI models are
applied, i.e., data is shared between different geo-distributed
computing infrastructures, including data servers (peers) [92].
However, sharing data among different geo-distributed peers
increases security risks. Moreover, increasing data computa-
tion increases the energy efﬁciency cost of deployed infrastruc-
ture for AI-based computations [93]. Hence, a robust, resilient,
and green-aware computing design is critical for realizing the
goal of secure and energy-efﬁcient AI models.

4) Data Infrastructure, Sharing and Analytics: Hypercon-
verged data infrastructure forms a foundational building block
in providing computing and data storage functions, enabling
the AI- and DT-based system functionalities. This increases
the importance of cyber-safe data transmission, storage, and
analysis technologies with the required certain features.
Communication Interfaces. Over-the-air,
industrial access
networks required a communication interface with extreme
reliability, ultra-low latency, high data rates, and massive
connectivity support
to transfer the bulk of collected and
sensed informational data to storage infrastructure for further
processing [94], [95]. Similarly, data sharing mechanisms and
interoperability in heterogeneous systems need to be enhanced,
increasing the importance of designing new data-sharing pro-
tocols for enabling secure and safe data transmission [96],
[97].
Scalable and Multi-level IT Infrastructure. SDN/NFV-
assisted scalable (upgradable) and multi-level (cloud/edge)
computing IT infrastructure is needed to handle the diverse
critical communication and computation requirements that can
dynamically provide customized data-related services in every
scenario [98], [99]. For this, softwarization across computing
IT infrastructure and emerging service-oriented architectures

7

(e.g., microservices, anything-as-a-service) gain importance
for enabling the customized softwarized service provisioning
paradigms. Similarly, blockchain network, AI-based solutions,
and private enterprise networks can provide better services for
cyber-security in computing infrastructure [100], [101], e.g.,
data integrity, secure communication, privacy preservation,
detecting intruder attacks.
Autonomy over Shared Infrastructure Resources. Soft-
warization in IT infrastructures enables autonomy and control
over the softwarized shared network resources by adopting
the multitenant architecture [102], [103], where softwarized
services orchestration can provide the required secure and
service-aware communications over virtual private networks.
Big Data Analytics and Management. Data analytics com-
bines the power of AI frameworks and high data computations
in search of extracting critical information from big data to
gain knowledge [104], [105]. This increases the importance
of data management, e.g., data traceability, data quality, data
features extraction, data storage and backup, data fusion.
Similarly, the data preprocess mechanism gains importance
for AI applications due to the unlabelled and raw nature of
initially collected big data [106].
Edge Computing and Micro Cloud. The edge computing
paradigm brings the centralized cloud capabilities closer to
the end-users, reducing end-to-end response time, latency, and
communication resources in mission-critical applications, e.g.,
migrating from cloud DT to edge DT. However, to enable an
edge computing paradigm, micro clouds are needed [10], [81],
[107]. In the edge computing paradigm, a new micro cloud-
based infrastructure comprises of compute nodes arranged
in small clusters with local storage and secure networking,
allowing repeatable, reliable remote deployments and on-
demand computing services at the edge of the network [108],
[109].

5) Bio-inspired Technologies.: It interconnects humans and
industrial assets (e.g., cobots) through communication devices
or sensors that use the biologically inspired sensing method-
ology.
Embedded Bio-sensor Network Technologies. Any physical
environment digitally interacts through the embedded sensor
networks (ESNs)— the mesh network of sensor chips/nodes or
computers with many sensors embedded in the physical envi-
ronment [110]. The nodes in ESNs are small and inexpensive
chips, each providing speciﬁc sensing functions. With wire-
less Internet connectivity, these embedded sensor networks
map the physical world and transmit data information to a
centralized cloud, enabling a wide range of applications [94],
[111], e.g., wireless body area networks (WBANs) for smart
health IoT applications, IIoT-based connectivity for enabling
CPS systems, etc. One emerging trend in sensor technology
is the robust biosensors— innovative analytical devices that
integrate the physiochemical and biological sensing element,
to enable sensing. Biosensors
i.e., analyte-based sensory,
applications are environmental monitoring, toxin detection,
drug and pathogen discovery in health applications, and food
monitoring [112].

6) Energy Efﬁciency: Almost

technologies mentioned
above require many energy resources to operate and provide

8

critical functions. This eventually increases the importance
of enabling technologies to adopt green technologies and
strategies for achieving goals of emission neutrality.
Integration of Renewable Energy Sources. Numerous en-
abling industries, e.g., manufacturing and automation factories,
run on the energies created through fossil fuel-based resources
(coal, oil, and natural gas), which causes harm to the environ-
ment through greenhouse gases [113]. Similarly, dust emis-
sions from industries pollute natural environmental resources.
Instead of fossil fuels, renewable energy resources must be
adopted for emission-neutral goals [113]. Some examples of
renewable energy sources are, solar energies, wind energy,
hydropower resources, geothermal energies, Hydrogen, and
synthetic non-carbon fuels. Similarly, smart dust systems need
to be adopted in the factory ecosystem to ﬁlter greenhouse gas
emissions and dust into the environment.
Energy-autonomous Sensor Systems (EAS) is designed
to operate and/or communicate in known or unknown en-
vironments that provide data communication, sensing, and
storage without connecting to a power source, e.g., grids,
batteries [114]. One example of an EAS system is wireless
powered communication networks (WPCNs), where power
is transferred over the air to enable data transfer [115]. In
WPCNs, energy harvesting paradigms are typically deployed,
enabling battery-free information transfer [116], e.g., ambient
backscatter communication and cooperative communication or
providing low-power data transmissions [117], e.g., simulta-
neous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT)
paradigm.

B. CI-NGWNs Architecture to Support Industry 5.0 Enablers

The integration of CI-NGWNs and the critical pillars of
Industry 4.0 (i.e., IIoT, CPS, and DT), next-generation IoTs
(NG-IoT), and SDN/NFV-enabled cloud/edge computing ar-
chitecture are poised to form critical drivers in supporting a
wide range of enabling requirements incurred by the industrial
and societal changes in Industry 5.0 scenarios, as illustrated
in Fig. 4.

1) Design Objectives: The design objectives of CI-NGWNs
lie in the domain of supporting enhanced communication and
networked computation requirements and enabling technologi-
cal features for Industry 5.0 vision [13] (c.f. Sec. III-A). These
design objectives are,

• Automated and distributed services using multitenancy ap-
proaches in CI-NGWNs service architecture to be ﬂexible,
self-optimized, and self-adapting and ensure diverse QoS
and QoE requirements in numerous industrial application.
• Capabilities of maximum and efﬁcient re-usability of shared

networking infrastructure.

• Open integration between numerous industrial applications
and CI-NGWN ecosystem to create new and diverse busi-
ness models for operators and service providers.

• Increased performance and lower cost of conventional
hardware-deﬁned systems (HWS) using hyper-converged
infrastructure (HCI)— software-deﬁned IT infrastructure
that virtualizes all HWS elements, i.e., computing, storage,
networking.

• Integrates big data analytics and AI/ML-based function-

network, and edge network.

• Ensure security, privacy, and energy efﬁciency (100x over

B5G) goals over the entire CI-NGWN architecture
2) Vision and CI-NGWNs NIB Architecture: To support
these design objectives, the vision of CI-NGWN has stepped
forth towards the network-in-box (NIB) architecture where
CI features and network softwarization is embedded across
all network layers [1], [10]–[12]. The hyper-level illustration
of CI-enabled NIB architecture for NGWNs is shown in
Fig. 4, where CI functionalities had roots at each functional
layer to provide intelligent features. These enabling CI-native
functional features are as follows.
• The inclusion of CI technologies (swarm AI, evolutionary
AI, and others) in conjunction with computing and storage
capabilities at cloud-fog-edge level of network hierarchy
(e.g., MECs) can bring the required functional edge in-
telligence closer to the physical layer. With the nexus of
blockchain technology, federated learning-based distributed
computing paradigms and private networking (e.g., private
5G) reduces the security and privacy concerns in NIB
architecture.

• It integrates multitenancy-enabled softwarized service or-
chestration and provisioning architecture for providing cus-
tomized services and modular functions, e.g., DT services,
ICAR services, private virtualized network resources, cog-
nitive APIs, AI frameworks, data processing, etc.

• It enables the transition from 5G service-based architecture
(SBA) to AI-native service architecture for provisioning en-
hanced services, e.g., mLLMTC, UmMTC, ERLLC, MBBL,
FeMBB, LDHMC, ELPC, and AEC. Moreover, it facilitates
connectivity-based interaction between softwarized modular
functions and AI-native architecture services.

• The O-RAN ALLIANCE standards are leading to radio
access networks (RAN) that are open, intelligent, virtu-
alized, and fully interoperable based on operator-deﬁned
speciﬁcations.

• It enables the ﬂexibility in network functions using zero-
touch network and service management paradigm,
i.e.,
service-aware networking, new resources allocations, appli-
cation deployments at edge nodes, dynamic setup of ded-
icated network resources for service provisioning, network
slicing, automated monitoring and control, etc,.

• It provides the support for integrating diverse access network
technologies in industries, i.e., 5G New Radio (NR), evolved
LTE, UAV- and satellite-based terrestrial network access,
ﬁxed access, WLANs (WiFi-5, WiFi-6), and wired net-
works (e.g., Industrial Ethernet, Fieldbus communications).
Similarly, inclusion of higher mmWave and THz spectrum
along with non-orthogonal multiple access schemes and
reﬂecting intelligent surfaces (RIS) increases the high data
rates connectivity and spectrum efﬁciency.

IV. SOFTWARIZED NETWORK CONTROL AND SERVICE
PROVISIONING FOR INDUSTRY 5.0

In the following subsections, we discusses the technological
transition in various layers of automation pyramid in Industry

9

5.0, service architecture framework to support softwarized
service provisioning, followed by the various customized
industrial services scenarios.

A. Multi-Tenant Service-oriented Industrial Architecture

Technological Transition in Industrial Automation. The 5C
smart automation architecture generally consists of ﬁve hierar-
chical levels/layers top to bottom, i.e., conﬁguration, cognition,
cyber, conversion, and connection [118, CPS 5C architecture].
With the convergence of CI-NGWNs along with SDN/NFV-
enabled cloud/edge-native computing paradigms and the crit-
ical pillars of Industry 4.0 (e.g., IIoT, CPS, and DT) to the
5C smart automation architecture, the technological transition
among various layers of pyramid arises with various functions
of 5C automation layers now embedded into the new layers,
i.e., infrastructure layer, computational intelligence layer and
service layer (c.f. Fig. 5).
Softwarized Architecture. The multi-tenant softwarized ar-
chitecture is poised to form key drivers in supporting wide
range of new and on-demand service requirements in zero-
defect manufacturing and matrix production systems, under
the vision of mass production and mass customization in
Industry 5.0 [119]. The novel framework can be observed from
Fig. 5 that closely integrates multiple function layers of smart
automation pyramid and enables interactions/communication
among numerous provisioned services, comprised of multiple
customized functions. Note that each layers of automation
pyramid in Fig. 5 can provides the foundational new function
blocks, such as virtualization functions, AI-native functions,
DT placements and others, that enables the softwarized service
provisioning to industrial applications. Moreover, as illustrated
in Fig. 6, it can closely integrate the principles of service-
oriented architecture (SOA) and microservices architecture
support to enable true digitization in Industry 5.0 vision [107],
[120], [121].
Signiﬁcance. The signiﬁcance of softwarized architecture are,

• Numerous industrial assets or industrial applications at the
smart connection layers provides the service requests to
the centralized service layer according to the demanding
industrial application requirements.

• Centralized management centers at the service layer can
orchestrate and provision the required on-demand services
needed closer at bottom layer, i.e., smart connection layer,
by utilizing cloud/edge-natice computing infrastructural re-
sources efﬁciently, which can be easily scaled, deployed and
monitored.

• Moreover, various monitoring control feedbacks and data
transmission for management can be send directly to the
service layer in real-time for further resource planning or
control purposes.

In this regard, Table. IV provides the taxonomy of various
softwarized service architectures that has unique signiﬁcance
and drawbacks concerning numerous industrial use cases.
Service Provisioning. To provision the on-demand incoming
service requests, the service layer uses the composite mixture
of underlying layers functions to orchestrate and deploy the

10

cloud/edge computing converges with the hierarchical automation and control pyramid.

requests [133]. Moreover, the introduction of multi-tenancy
also introduces the shift in monolithic software components
to cloud/edge-native microservices architecture [128]. Thus
enabling the integration of agile software development and IT
operations (DevOps) strategies to develop smart factory-based
microservices closer to the physical layer. The opensource
software orchestrator tools, such as Kubernetes (K8s) and
OpenStack, can be adopted at the service layer to support the
cloud/edge-native scalable service orchestration and deploy-
ment.
Service mesh and Composite Service Blocks. Depending
upon the on-demand service requirement, the uniﬁed service
management and orchestration (SMO) function block in con-
trol and management plane of service layer select the mixture
of appropriate softwarized functions, i.e., AFL, VFL, DTFL,
and any infrastructure layer-related functions [127]. It helps
in creating and assigning group of composite service blocks
industrial service application. The service
for multi-tenant
mesh layer enables the required distinct group of softwarized
functions in composite service blocks are closely managed and
controlled by uniﬁed SMO through bi-communicating with
the uniﬁed MO of underlying layers. Moreover, it controls
service-to-service communication over entire network infras-
tructure. This enables the centralized service management and
control center capabilities, helping in orchestrating, deploying
and managing industrial service applications remotely from
anywhere over Internet infrastructure [125].

2) Computational Intelligence Layer: This layer integrates
the three critical core function layers, i.e., AI analytics, virtual
systems, and DT systems, that work in tandem to enables the
paradigm of softwarized intelligent services orchestration and
deployment for industrial end-systems. The function of critical
function layers are,

orchestrated service to the industrial assets of numerous in-
dustries [10]. Each layer provides the functional blocks which
provides the following functions.

1) Service Layer: It integrates the functions of top three 5C
architecture layers, i.e., cyber layer (twin model for machine
components), cognition layer (integrated simulation and syn-
thesis) and conﬁguration layer (self-conﬁgure/adjust/optimized
for resilience), and customized service provisioning paradigm
to enable the true softwarized cloud/edge-native microservices
architecture. It comprises of two functional blocks.

tions for numerous applications, i.e., business analytics, zero-

upon the application requirements, these AI-native functions
selects and builds the appropriate AI model from available AI
models repository to provide the customized intelligent roles,
such as data mining and clustering, intelligent decision-making
and control [134]. Combining AI-native functions to analytic
tools, it can analyze and extract the high value information at
the big datalakes that stores arriving bigdata from thousands
of heterogeneous data sources in various layers, such as
factory processes, industrial assets, core networked devices,
DT applications, service application data, data from virtualized
industrial network, customer feedbacks, machine data, etc.
These analytic operations are summarized in Fig. 7, which
shows the four stages of analytic application types and their
description with respect to the value and difﬁculty of analytic
tasks. By integrating high power computing capability (HPC)
with AI analytics, high power data analytic (HPDA) can be
applied at the big datalakes with the increase in the value and
difﬁculty of analytic tasks [105].
Virtual Systems Function Layer (VFL). Virtualization or
virtual system functions offers the dedicated, distributed and
isolated physical resources over inter/intra-connected HCI
systems (infrastructure layer) based on the on-demand service
requirements [135]. Following types of virtual functions are
provided by VSFL.

• Virtual Storage/Server Functions (VSF): Virtual server in-
volves the partitioning of computer server having large
memory, GPU, CPU and disk resources into small multiple
virtual machines (VMs) with dedicated resources assigned to
it [136]. Similarly, virtual storage integrates the networked
storage devices over multiple machines into single virtual
storage device which facilitates the dynamic storage re-
sources allocation as well as data backup and recovery tasks.
VSF provides both the required virtual machines and/or
virtual storage resources required over the entire enterprise

network.

• Virtual Compute Functions (VCF): Virtual compute services
are enabled through the usage of virtual servers and virtual
storage since compute resources integrates the memory,
GPU, CPU and storage resources, which are accessible to
the multiple users [137]. VCF blocks over infrastructure
layer resources provides the virtual compute services to the
multiple incoming on-demand service requests.

• Virtual Network Functions (VNF): Network virtualization

Predictive Analytics:   Encompasses advanced diagnostic analytics and predictive modelling to incorporate current insight and past hindsight analysis, and step forth towards foresight, i.e., prediction/forecasting about future production efficiency or unknown disaster events, e.g., statistical method-based forecaster (ARIMA, SARIMA, etc.), ML/DL-based forecaster for multivariate forecasting (LSTM, GRU, CNN etc.)Perspective Analytics:  Goes beyond the paradigm of simple prediction towards more controlled action activities based on available predicting options, making desired outcome a reality, e.g., deep reinforcement learning, CPS/DT-based monitoring and control, etc.Computational layerService layerSmart connection layer Infrastructure layerPerspective Analytics:Predictive Analytics:Diagnostic Analytics:Descriptive Analytics:through SDN/NFV functionalities enables the management
and control of entire enterprise network (dedicated and
shared) through software-deﬁned single or multiple ad-
ministrative entity [138]–[140]. Thus providing the auton-
omy over enterprise network. Some of the virtual network
functions are, 1) SDN routing and switching functions,
2) service-aware routing, 3) provision of virtual network
and tunneling over internet, e.g., virtual private network,
virtual fog/edge networks 3) trafﬁc analysis, e.g., deep
packet inspection, QoS and QoE measurements, 4) opti-
mization of application access requests over network, e.g.,
load balancers, 5) security functions, e.g., network ﬁrewalls,
network intrusion detection, etc., and 6) 5G core network
components, e.g., radio network controller, user plane func-
tion (UPF), data network, network slice selection function
(NSSF), core access and mobility management functions
(AMF), etc.

• Container-based Virtualization: The requirement of scal-
ability, ﬂexibility and agility in DevOps techniques for
cloud/edge networked computing paradigm and the depen-
dency of VM over single operating system and hypervisor
has led to the containerization or container-based virtu-
alization [141]. Container are different from VMs since
they do not use hypervisor and easily carries all pack-
aged softwarized components (i.e., runtime libraries and
OS dependencies) of microservices/applications [142]. This
enables the improved and enhanced integration of virtual-
ization functions that works in tandem with state-of-the-art
cloud/edge-native networked computing architecture [143].
DT Function Layer (DTFL). DT function layer uses the
functionalities of AFL and VFL to provides the following
DT functions, 1) Virtual simulation and performance predic-
tion [81], 2) Product lifecycle and predictive maintenance, 3)
machine failure analysis, and 4) conﬁguration design, motion
planning and control development.

Infrastructure layer

3) Infrastructure Layer.:

forms the
backbone between the underlying smart connection layer and
the upper topmost layers. Following functions and roles are
integrated into this layer.
HCI Resources. Infrastructure layer composed of SDN/NFV-
based inter/intra-networked HCI physical systems that pro-
vides the fog/edge computing capabilities, Elasticsearch-
enabled datalakes, and network resources to industrial end-
systems on smart connection layer [98], [99].
Industrial Access Networks. The industrial access networks,
providing a communication interface for the operation tech-
nology (OT) domain, enable ﬁeld-level communication among
controllers, machines, and within machines at the routing,
control, and sensor level based on the IEC 61784-2 and
IEC 61158-1 standards [144]. At present, due to diverse
industrial connectivity requirements, various wired solutions
for the industrial networks exist, such as Ethernet-based (e.g.,
PROFINET, EtherCAT) and ﬁeld-buses (e.g., PROFIBUS).
However, these variants lead to various issues in realizing
the Industry 5.0 vision, including hardware/protocol hetero-
geneity and multiple solutions for enterprise-wide connectivity
while maintaining a strict boundary between OT and IT
networks [145], [146]. Eliminating or at least thinning this

12

boundary between IT and OT domains is the prerequisite to
improving the efﬁciency and agility of the industrial processes.
is a step towards this,
Time-sensitive networking (TSN),
where the IEEE 802.1 time-sensitive networking (TSN) task
group is developing a set of standards (through various TSN
proﬁles) to extend the best-effort Ethernet networking model
the
to provide deterministic streaming services [28]. Still,
missing part towards achieving a full-scale network connec-
tivity is the inclusion of wireless access to support massive
sensing, mobility, and customizable/agile processes. However,
the prominent industrial wireless standards (e.g., ISA100.11a,
WirelessHART, Industrial WLAN by Siemens) are designed
mainly to support low-rate and/or localized wireless access
for industrial monitoring/control applications. These standards
operate on unlicensed frequency bands (making them prone to
interference issues) and provide short-range connectivity to a
limited number of devices. On the other hand, 5G-and-beyond
networks with service-based architecture, various RAN and
Core enhancements, and 5G-TSN integration(c.f. Fig. 13) are
becoming attractive to provide robust, scalable, uniﬁed, and
customizable wired-wireless connectivity for Industry 5.0.
Autonomy and Control. It can provides the autonomy and
control over HCI resources and industrial access networks.
For example, an enterprise can solely own the access networks
and locally installed HCI resources providing total autonomy
over enterprise network [103]. Similarly, different vendors
can also provides the enhanced infrastructure layer resources
in the forms of softwarized services to various industrial
enterprises, which can also be closely integrated with the
locally owned enterprise network. Thus enabling the new
digitized and diverse business models for different IT and OT
vendors. (c.f. [147])
Data-to-Information Functions. Datalakes closer to access
networks layer collect and stores raw machine data, ERP data,
IIoT data and controller data from end-systems on smart con-
nection layer [148]. That raw data carries an inherent property
of 5V’s, i.e., volume, velocity, variety, veracity and value. By
applying one of the data-to-information (DTI) functions, i.e.,
pre-process and data fusion, over the collected raw data to
extract information and create knowledge that helps in value
creation throughout a product life cycle [149]. Similarly there
are other functions embedded in the DTI functions layers, e.g.,
data features engineering. Note that based on the obtainable
knowledge, useful action can be taken at the manufacturing
ﬂoor, such as increase production efﬁciency by redesigning
process based on the customer feedbacks, increased resources
supply for customized ﬂows from production warehouse in
zero-defect manufacturing, etc.

V. OPEN AND INTELLIGENT 6G NETWORK
ARCHITECTURES

As apparent from previous discussions, Industry 5.0 can
be characterized by an increasingly complex ecosystem, re-
quiring an ever-expanding multitude of service classes and
their disparate time-varying trafﬁc proﬁles. A forthcoming
pathway to address this complexity challenge is the con-
vergence of the ﬁrepower of three promising technologies,

13

namely artiﬁcial intelligence, edge computing, and beyond-
5G/6G networks. The convergence is already happening, with
an intention of accelerating the automation and optimization of
NextG wireless networks to support diverse QoS requirements
while capitalizing on edge computing and AI/ML. In this
context, Automation is required to cope with new scenarios
in network/edge planning, operation, and management for
vertical industries and enterprise use cases, while also creating
the space and opportunity for new infrastructure owners and
service providers. Meanwhile, optimization is necessary to
extend the computing and fast-growing AI/ML applications
to the edge so that each network element can provide low
latency, high reliability, and pervasive intelligence services.

Be it reducing the data transfer size to the cloud or pro-
cessing urgency, the data handling must occur closer to the
data source, i.e., at the network edge. The edge is deﬁned as a
continuum of “edge zones” comprising four key areas: device,
premise (on-site, e.g., enterprise campus), access, and metro
(upstream aggregation point like service provider) edge [150].
As evident by names, each edge zone can fulﬁll different
computing/processing requirements well-suited to close the
loop (data generation to data processing) according to its local
environment without data transmission to a central server.
For instance, IIoT devices (e.g., AMRs) can make navigation
decisions with autonomous and intelligent local computation
considering their local environment. Meanwhile, the AMRs’
integration within the matrix production environment can rely
on the on-premise edge for collective intelligence and load
training data to the access or metro edge.

Therefore,

the need for intelligent edge automation in
NextG networks is vital for Industry 5.0 for automation
and optimization for various tasks such as distributed data
collection, real-time processing, situational awareness, and
network slicing under trafﬁc dynamics. Nevertheless, this new
capability comes with its own set of challenges, especially

it will require an open and intelligent network infrastructure
to support automation, control, and management of network
resources and services. Being intelligent implies handling the
complex task of efﬁcient management of information ﬂows
and, consequently, network infrastructure as every industry and
use case will demand different architecture.

This section aims to elaborate on various underpinning
concepts, activities, and challenges of creating such an intel-
ligent 6G architecture. In particular, we discuss the open and
intelligent 6G network architecture, with a focus on Open RAN
framework for RAN/edge automation, and ensuing end-to-end
network intelligence requirements and challenges.

A. Envisioned 6G Architecture

To accelerate the needed automation and optimization in
NextG networks for on-demand heterogeneous service deploy-
ment, beyond-5G and 6G networks are rapidly transitioning
from inﬂexible and monolithic to agile, disaggregated, and
cloud-native architectures based on softwarization and vir-
tualization, with the provision network component’s repro-
grammability. The transition aims to provide multi-tenancy
transparent communication network infrastructure for instantly
orchestrating end-to-end physical resources and virtual net-
work functions (VNFs) across various network domains.
Herein, the separation between the control functions and the
hardware fabric as well as the introduction of standardized
control interfaces will deﬁne custom closed-control loops, en-
abling edge intelligence and real-time analytics; thus realizing
the autonomous, self-organizing networks (SON) effectively.
In this respect, the standardization initiatives are already
reﬂecting the desired architectural redesign, which will further
require enhancing NI-nativeness at various network levels (see
Sec. V-C). Fig. 8 summarizes envisioned (re)-design of end-to-
end network architecture based on the current standardization

following are the notable points:
• The redesign decouples software (network functions) from
the hardware to enhance overall network operations, and
enable end-to-end softwarization, where the traditional phys-
ical network functions (PNFs) are complemented by VNFs
and cloud-native network functions (CNFs).

• It includes overarching AI-driven entities (i.e., controllers),
responsible for the orchestration and control of PNF, VNFs,
and CNFs across all network domains. Orchestration relates
to lifecycle management of service and network functions,
including instantiation, scaling, and termination, as well as
control e.g., for context-aware parameter tuning of network
functions.

• Also, it transitions the classical access-core split into micro-
domains or edge zones to increase the management granu-
larity of physical infrastructures in micro-domain.
Fig. 8 shows the expected deployment and operation of
controllers/orchestrators in various micro-domains, including
Core, Transport, Edge (hosting the RAN’s cloud part), and
Far Edge (consisting of radio units (RUs) and the fronthaul).
Note that the E2E Orchestrators operate at a global network
level (i.e., in core network deployments and service-related
applications in private network deployments [147]) while
Edge/Fog Orchestrators on the mobile edge level. Meanwhile,
the Controllers introduce enhanced RAN versatility by shifting
the network functionalities closer to the user; Non-Real-Time
controllers for less time-critical network functionalities at a
limited number of sites, and Real-Time Controllers for fast-
timescale functionalities (e.g., radio resource and interference
management) to meet QoS targets.

This novel e2e 6G architecture is expected to enable new
functionalities, including [154]: (i) service differentiation to
provide demand-based virtual network slices over a com-
mon physical infrastructure, while meeting multi-tenancy and
multi-service requirements, (ii) split network functions across
multiple software and hardware components, provided by
multiple vendors, (iii) capture/expose the KPIs, and network
analytics through open interfaces, and (iv) real-time control
of the entire network infrastructure via (third party) software
these functionalities will enable ﬁne-
applications. Jointly,
grained network automation and optimization, so that
the
network functions and their allocated resources can be adapted
to trafﬁc dynamics and meeting diverse, heterogeneous QoS
requirements.

Over the last few years, multiple independent alliances and
forums have initiated research on accelerating this transfor-
mation by increasing infrastructure virtualization, combined
with embedded intelligence, to deliver more agile services
and advanced capabilities to end-users. Open RAN is such
an initiative that enables such transformation via open and
intelligent RAN automation, which we discuss in detail in the
following section.

RAN initiatives is to create a multi-vendor RAN solution
that allows for the separation (or disaggregation) between
hardware and software with open interfaces and standard
network elements, hosting control and management software
in the cloud.
vRAN vs Open RAN. Before going further, the distinction
between virtual RAN (vRAN) and Open RAN is important.
Virtualization, which transforms network function into VNFs,
decouples VNF software such that it can run on the com-
mercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. However, in vRAN
setup, the interfaces between network elements may still be
closed or proprietary [155]. In contrast, Open RAN refers
to a set of standards for creating open internal interfaces as
well as deﬁnes an disaggregated architecture to introduce new
capabilities of RAN automation, and service management and
orchestration.
RAN Functional Splits. RAN has stringent latency require-
ments, demanding interworking between NFs accordingly.
Therefore, some NFs are virtualized at the cloud using central
units (CU) while many RAN functions occur at distributed
units (DU) (located closer to the cell site), where a DU is
split into a baseband unit (BBU) and a radio unit (RU). In
this respect, the Functional splits refer to the points along the
protocol stack where CU and DU signal processing can be
separated from the RU. Meanwhile, how CU and DU func-
tions can be distributed in various edge-zones is deployment
scenario and use case dependent.
Fronthaul Interface: CPRI & eCPRI. The fronthaul in-
terface in 4G architecture, called as common public radio
interface (CPRI) connects the DU signal processing to the
RU. In 4G,
the
daterate of a maximum of 600 Mbit/s of fronthaul interface
was needed for 10 MHz of radio channel bandwidth. On
the other hand, in 5G systems, with a radio bandwidth of
100 MHz and above and massive multiple-input multiple-
output (mMIMO) antennas, fronthaul bandwidth of hundreds
of Gbit/s is required. To support this, the 3GPP has introduced
an enhanced-CPRI (eCPRI) interface while to reduce the
overall fronthaul bandwidth an increased number of functional
splits are possible. In fact, 3GPP deﬁnes eight functional splits,
where parts of the DU’s functions can be combined with the
RU. Which split to employ leads to several ramiﬁcations, such

the DU-RU split was designed such that

as 1) additional DU electronics and energy-consumption costs
if combined with the RU, 2) the distance (affecting latency)
between the two elements, and 3) high-performance computing
needs to process signals at the DU. Importantly, eCPRI still
contains vendor-speciﬁc elements.

Figure 9 summarises the various stages of evolution of RAN
architectures, from traditional to open and disaggregated RAN.
Disaggregation and Intelligence in O-RAN. The O-RAN Al-
liance [153], which is a consortium of network operators cre-
ated in 2018, is working to realize NextG networks by develop-
ing speciﬁcations, reference architecture, and open interfaces
to intelligently manage/control multi-vendor infrastructures
to delivering critical, high-performance services. To achieve
this goal, O-RAN proposes an architectural changes using
two core principles. First, O-RAN embraces and promotes
the 3GPP functional splits, where a typical Base Station’s
(BS) functionalities are virtualized as network functions and
distributed across various network nodes, i.e., CU, DU, and
RU. This facilitates the instantiation and execution of diverse
networking processes at different network points. Therefore,
one of O-RAN’s work groups is focused on creating an open,
interoperable fronthaul interface to enable the integration of
DUs and RUs from different vendors; thus, enabling a true
multi-vendor ecosystem. Second, which is likely to be an cru-
cial architectural component of 6G systems, is the introduction
of the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) that allows operators
to deploy customizable control plane functions. RIC comes in
two variants:

• Non-real time RIC (non-RT RIC) provides an open plat-
form for policy-based RAN control using rApps, including
mechanisms for enabling artiﬁcial intelligence and machine
learning for more efﬁcient network management and orches-
tration. The non-RT RIC is expected to perform operations
with higher than one second time granularity.

• Near-real time RIC (near-RT RIC) is aimed at abstracting
the control processes, typically embedded in BS, and execut-
ing those processes as third-party applications xApps in the
cloud. The near-RT RIC handles procedures at timescales
of tens of milliseconds and implement intelligence through
data-driven control loops.

In both variants, RIC facilitates RAN optimization through
closed-control (action to feedback) loops, between RAN com-
ponents and their controllers. O-RAN envisions different loops
operating at timescales that range from 1 ms (e.g., for real-time
control of transmission schemes) to thousands of milliseconds
(e.g., for network slicing, trafﬁc forecasting). Table V sum-
marizes the timescale-related information and challenges in
RICs.

Although the O-RAN architecture is gaining momentum
among operators, vendors and researchers,
the challenges
related to its implementation for true NextG networks (i.e.,
built as data-driven, open, programmable, and virtualized)
are largely to be handled. In the literature, there are various
ongoing efforts towards answering such important concerns,
including [154] (i) the functionalities/parameters to be con-
trolled by each network entity, (ii) distribution of network
intelligence, (iii) validation and training of data-driven control

15

loop solutions, and (iv) provision of access to data and
analytics from the RAN to the AI agents while minimizing
the overhead.

Towards these concerns a few notable studies are [154],
[156]–[158] (for an extensive review see [159]). In [154],
[156], the potential and challenges of data-driven optimization
approaches to network control over different timescales are
discussed for disaggregated O-RAN architecture. In [154], the
authors optimized the scheduling policies of co-existing net-
work slices (NS). In this respect, while leveraging O-RAN in-
terfaces to collect edge data, the authors demonstrated closed-
loop integration of real-time analytics and control through
DRL agenets for RAN control through xApps at near-RT RIC.
In [156], an intelligent radio resource management scheme
with LSTM-based trafﬁc congestion handling is demonstrated
on a real-world dataset. The LSTM model, trained at non-RT
RIC, is used for inference at near-RT RIC for cell splitting
of congested cells to improve the related KPIs. In [158],
the authors developed O-RAN control and management layer
intelligent functions (i.e., near-RT RIC and non-RT RIC) to
solve the O-RAN slicing problem for the industrial IoT. In
particular, for O-RAN control, this study performs the radio
connectivity management in the near-RT RIC, where the stable
IIoT and small base stations (SBSs) associations distributedly
using the matching game are determined. Using the outcomes
of the matching game, the IIoT slice requests’ demand are
measured to generate IIoT service-speciﬁc slice templates at
non-RT RIC while considering the slicing constraints at the
QoS management module in the near-RT RIC. Meanwhile,

The vision of 6G networks is set to meeting the require-
ments of ever-expanding multitude of service classes and their
disparate time-varying trafﬁc proﬁles. This vision is leading
towards the need and ability to instantly orchestrate end-to-end
physical resource and virtual network functions (VNFs) across
different network domains through multi-tenancy transparent
communication network infrastructure, which grows the man-
agement complexity of already complex network architectures
beyond the grasp of human-in-the-loop approaches. Therefore,
the success of 6G networks will greatly depend on the Network
intelligence (NI), and its quality, to fully automate the network
operation and management. Herein, AI models, deployed at
network controllers and network orchestrators will be corner-
stone in NI design in solving complex and dynamic problems
of massive and heterogeneous network trafﬁc. Speciﬁcally,
AI-driven NI will be deployed in 6G networks for human-
intervention free automated decision making for adapting
network resource and functions to the use case demands
and requirements. In end-to-end NI-native 6G architecture,
AI models needs to be tailored according to the network
functional needs at each speciﬁc network level. Despite the

multiple examples of NI-driven handling of network operation,
they are limited in receiving native integration support from the
network architecture. In [160], the challenges and directions
towards integration of NI-driven functionalities for network
capacity and forecasting 6G architecture are presented. The
two key identiﬁed challenges for incorporating NI in 6G
networks are:

• End-to-end NI-native architecture: The NextG network
architecture should facilitate hosting and integration of NI
instances explicitly at NF levels and their coordination
across network domains. Meanwhile, the current standard-
ization trends towards updating the existing network design
must reﬂect that.

• Customized AI for NI: AI models should facilitate network
automation and management, and thereby adapted (w.r.t.
latency guarantees training and computational complexity)
for NI-speciﬁc design aspects according to the needs of
network functionalities.

1) NI Role in 6G Systems: To support diverse services,
tenants, and slices, NI will be fundamental for the optimal
operation of this softwarized, cloudiﬁed and split network
architecture and managing the multi-level network functions
and associated resources. Considering the variety of net-
work management
tasks and the entailing functions, each
orchestrator/controller will need to run multiple NI instances.
Meanwhile, an NI instance must ﬁrst swiftly detect or pre-
dict the new requests or their ﬂuctuations. Then, it should
react by automously instantiating, relocating, or re-conﬁguring
network resources/functions, such that a) trafﬁc demands are
met with desired QoS requirements, b) reuse maximization
of infrastructure and resources (across multiple tenants and
resources), and c) ultimately completely eliminating human
intervention to achieve zero-touch network and service man-
agement vision [161]. These aspects are all highly critical, and
the success of 6G systems will greatly depend on the quality
and appropriate integration of NI solutions in the complete
network. The NI across network can be divided at three scales
based on the timescale of the associated management and
automation, as described below:

• NI at Orchestrators: The NI integrated at E2E and edge
orchestrators has a broader network scope to manage func-
tions/resources and take decisions, with an effect on large

sets of RAN entities. Since, at orchestrator level, the network
statistics their dynamics vary relatively slowly, automation
and management functions are performed at timescales of
minutes to hours. Consequently, NI decisions must endure
large time windows.

• NI at non-RT RIC: As the non-RT controllers must handle
reduced time-criticality functionalities of a limited number
of radio sites, the associated NI will operate at a local scope,
with decisions in the order of tens of seconds.

• NI at near-RT RIC: the NI deployed within near-RT
RIC will ensure fast-timescale functionalities (as expected
within O-RAN [153] or FOG-05 [162] frameworks), such as
radio scheduling, interference management, which typically
require data-driven decision-making at timescales of mil-
liseconds or even lower. The other proposal is to integrate
NI within NFs themselves, e.g., to enable functionalities
operating beyond-edge micro-domain, for instance, realiz-
ing programmable radio environments (e.g., using ) with
localized, fast decision making.
2) NI Integration Challenges: The current trends in NI
for NextG network orchestration, promoted by major stan-
dardization bodies, are based on the closed-loop AI [150];
that is, the NI instances at the orchestrators or controllers
work in closed-control loops. These loops abide modern AI’s
learning principles; recording the context of management
decisions, continuous monitoring for collecting observations
on the decision quality, and ﬁnally using feedback to improve
future decisions. The close-loop models allow NI to apprehend
to learn over time to automate optimal decision making
towards the expected targets. Currently, the prevailing vision
for closed-loop NI expects instances located at orchestrators or
controllers in the control plane that interact with NFs deployed
in the data plane [160]. This vision results into two major
limitations, as follows.
1) Strictly centralized closed-loop models hinder the effec-
tiveness of network intelligence; there is a risk in data-
to-decision communication delay for critical management
scenarios. To be more effective, many network functionali-
ties must operate at timescales that are not compatible with
the current lengthy data gathering procedures at NFs, data
processing at control plane, and ﬁnal restitution of actions
to be executed in the data plane. As a results, the feedback
loop between the control and data planes hinders NI to

trends;

2) The interaction among NI instances at different levels is
not promoted in the current architectural
thus,
the reciprocal mutual impact of their individual actions
cannot be captured [160]. Therefore, to enable optimal NI
operation at each level, cooperation between NI instances
is vital to allow for global optimality and convergence of
the zero-touch network management process. Therefore,
To tackle these limitations, architectural design of 6G
networks must necessarily take into account the NI-native
choices.

VI. COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE FOR INDUSTRY 5.0

Modern technologies rely heavily on CI techniques and CFE
computing platform not only to automate the process in a
dynamic manner but also to help achieve the desired efﬁciency.
In this regard, we reviewed some of the CI techniques and
related work for different targeted domains in Sec. VI-A,
which is followed by the Sec. VI-B that focuses discussion on
related work on critical CFE computing. Similarly, onwards
Sec. VI-C, VI-D and VI-E explores the integrated capabilities
of CI techniques and CFE computing for three pillars of
Industry 5.0 vision.

A. Computational Intelligence

Along with CFE, computational intelligence is considered
one of the key enabling technologies for Industry 5.0. The CI
methods are quite a wide area, thus includes a wide variety of
methods including but not limited to neural fuzzy systems, soft
computing techniques, evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement
learning, unsupervised learning, supervised learning, self-
supervised learning, federated learning, and more (c.f. Fig. 10).
The growth, success rate, and evolution of intelligent ap-
thanks to
plications has been drastic in the past decade,
the deep learning architectures and computing advancements.

Therefore, the ﬁfth iteration of the revolution takes advantage
of the characteristics of CI to achieve sustainable, efﬁcient,
and effective industrial processes.

1) Supervised Learning: The supervised learning is the
most commonly used learning method in the ﬁeld of CI [163].
It requires the set of associated labels with the data to learn the
patterns or trends to perform tasks like prediction, forecasting,
classiﬁcation, detection, segmentation, and others.

2) Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning methods
are those that do not have a reference to start with. Algorithms
in this category identify patterns from acquired data to make
sense of them [164]. The learned patterns can then be used
for various applications such as data clustering, market seg-
mentation, and other related applications.

3) Self-Supervised Learning: The self-supervised learning
is a new paradigm and can be considered as an intermediate
algorithm between unsupervised and supervised learning, re-
spectively. The self-supervised methods assumes that the data
is not of the best quality in terms of labels (opposed to the
supervised learning), thus it starts with the training of pseudo-
labels associated with data and then can carry on to employ
supervised or unsupervised learning for improving the desired
task [165]. Self-supervised learning is relatively new and has
been proven to be effective speciﬁcally in audio processing,
as is evident from its usage for speech recognition on Meta
(formerly Facebook).

4) Evolutionary Algorithms: Evolutionary algorithms en-
compass optimization and meta-heuristic algorithms to solve
the task at hand. These algorithms are certainly good when
there is no assumption about the optimized values to begin
with. Although, the evolutionary algorithms can do the job
but at most times they are computationally complex, therefore,
they can either be used with hard constraints to lower the com-
putational complexity or with prior approximations that are
near to the optimal values [8]. There are various and popular
methods that can be categorized as evolutionary algorithms,

bee colony, ant colony optimization, gray-wolf optimization,
Harris-hawk optimization, sailﬁsh optimization, ﬁreﬂy opti-
mization, harmony search, and others.

5) Neural Fuzzy Systems: Neural Fuzzy systems use fuzzy
theory as its underlying technique to represent the probabilistic
values between true and false states in conjunction with
neural networks [1]. Neural Fuzzy theory has been extensively
applied over the years in the ﬁeld of home appliance control,
power system control, and control systems, in general.

6) Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning, also
known as learning-by-experience, trains an agent by taking
actions with perceived inputs and interprets the environment
to maximize cumulative rewards [8]. The method heavily relies
on the notion of exploration versus exploitation of the prior
and acquired knowledge to achieve the desired task. It has
gained a lot of interest from the research community in the
ﬁeld of robotics, autonomous driving, resource optimization,
and ﬁnancial technology (FinTech) applications.

7) Federated Learning: Federated learning on the other
hand is also a relatively new technique, but is proposed to
address privacy and security concerns while improving the
task at hand [166]. The method was ﬁrst proposed by Google,
which does not send the data to the server, in contrast to the
other learning algorithms. Federated learning requires only the
trained model, which is collected by the number of users,
aggregated on the server, and then sent to the user for model
update. Federated learning has become very popular due to its
secure characteristics and has been extensively applied in the
ﬁeld of communication systems.

8) Soft Computing Techniques: The last in this discussion
are the soft computing techniques that are quite analogous
to numerical computation. It kind of combines the charac-
teristics of the aforementioned learning algorithm, such as
supervised/unsupervised learning, fuzzy logic, evolutionary
techniques, and probabilistic reasoning, to approximate the
solution rather than provide an optimized one [163], [167].
These techniques are imprecise, but can be effectively tolerant
to uncertainty. For real world applications that can cater to
higher risk for robust solutions at reasonable cost, the soft
computing techniques are ideal and natural ﬁt. Existing studies
suggest that without the use of computational intelligence
techniques, Industry 5.0 could not be realized in an effective
way [47], [49].

9) CI for Holistic Industry 5.0 Framework: Some studies
have also emphasized on the use of CI techniques for solving
sustainability and resiliency concerning Industry 5.0 [48]–[50],
[66] while others related the use of CI to achieve or realize
speciﬁc characteristics of Industry 5.0 such as human-machine
collaboration [59], [64], [65], pandemic situations (COVID-
19) [60], education [168], medical and health [63], robotics
[67], Blockchain [54], Digital Society [61], [62], Society 5.0
[57], Energy [169], [170], UAVs [55], Mass Customization
[170], and Emotional Intelligence [56]. A summary of the
applications targeted by the summarized studies in Industry 5.0
is shown in Fig. 11. Below we reviewed some of the works
carried out towards exploring the CI in targeted application
domains concerning Industry 5.0.

18

Fig. 11. Distribution of the targeted application domains considered by the
summarized studies using CI techniques.

Industrial Automation and FoFs. Jain et al. [55] focused
mainly on an application of Industry 5.0, that is, allowing
communication through UAVs in future industries. The UAVs
are assumed to be equipped with CI techniques to recognize,
classify, and secure the data contents, speciﬁcally the image
modality. Han et al. [67] emphasized human-robot collabo-
ration for increased productivity in industries associated with
the ﬁfth iteration. However, the study deviated more towards
the design of robots that can exhibit not only autonomous
intelligence, but also integration of human supervision. Their
study proposed the development of an intelligent swarm
robotic system that can be used as an intelligent automation
system, as well as for functions controlling humanoid organ.
To achieve the said task, the study heavily used CI techniques
to control the robotic system with human commands and in
an autonomous way, accordingly.
Robotics. In [64], authors emphasized the human-machine
collaboration for the realization of Industry 5.0. The study
considers sensor data interoperability, digital twins, virtual
training, intelligent autonomous systems, and machine cogni-
tion to be the driving forces for human-machine collaboration.
The study suggested that CI techniques are analogous to
threads that connect the aforementioned driving forces in the
context of Industry 5.0. Similarly, Maddikunta et al. [47]
suggested that CI is one of the key enabling technologies for
the realization of Industry 5.0. They suggested that CI can
be used to bring sustainability and automation in applications
such as smart additive manufacturing, predictive maintenance,
hypercustomization, and cyberphysical cognitive systems. Fur-
thermore, they also suggested that the CI plays a key role
in realizing cobots, which is one of the key characteristics
of Industry 5.0. On the other hand, Javaid and Haleem [171]
emphasized on the use of CI for realizing Industry 5.0, speciﬁ-
cally in the ﬁeld of manufacturing. The study listed 17 critical
components need to be undertaken for adoption of Industry 5.0
in manufacturing. Amongst them, cobots, emergent artiﬁcial
intelligence, multiagent systems and technologies, complex
adaptive systems, and virtual reality heavily rely on the CI
for effective realization. Although components, holography,
4D printing, 5D printing, smart manufacturing, Internet of
Everything, and Big data are complimentary domains that can

be used with CI for various applications.
Healthcare. The authors in [60], [63] proposed the use of
Industry 5.0 for healthcare in the context of the current
pandemic (COVID-19), as well as in general. These studies
explore various paradigms, issues, and challenges associated
with the realization of Industry 5.0 in the healthcare industry
to facilitate physicians, practitioners, and patients. Among all
enabling technologies, both studies focus on the use of CI to
make the smarter, accurate, sustainable, and resilient.
Digital Society. The studies [62], [61], and [57] considered
the aspect of digitization and digital society in the industry
5.0 ecosystem. The former two studies evaluated the tech-
nologies that are essential for the digitization of Industry 5.0
components, while the latter represented the description of
Industry 5.0 as a complex mathematical problem. The study
suggested that giving it a formal description would not only
help the enterprises to transition from the fourth to the ﬁfth
industrial revolution, but also help in measuring the cost, thus,
by extension, making the business information support more
efﬁcient. Both of the studies highly emphasize on the use of
CI as an underlying technology to achieve the digitization
process.

B. Cloud/Edge-native Computing Network Infrastructure

The availability of HCI computing infrastructure and com-
munication resources at the core and edge of NIBs (c.f. Fig. 5),
i.e., cloud-fog-edge computing network infrastructure, can
provide the necessary communication and computation plat-
form for enabling CI techniques in different Industry 5.0
applications. Numerous critical enablers for CFE computing
is shown in Fig. 10.

1) Cloud-Fog-Edge (CFE) Computing: In order to achieve
green communication and sustainability within the Industry
5.0 ecosystem, key components,e.g., IoT, CFE computing in
cloud-/edge-native network architecture, and AI are the key en-
abling technologies [49]. The amalgamation of IoT and cloud-
edge-fog computing for sustainable communication is referred
to as Green IoT (G-IoT) system, which aims to minimize the
energy consumption in the communication system. In general,
the main task of the IoT system is to collect data from sensors
and send the response to the IoT actuators. The integration of
cloud in the general IoT system acts as a liaison for managing
the implicit services and interacting with remote users as well
as third party services, accordingly. Since the cloud-based IoT
systems are centralized, they suffer from long response latency
and bottlenecks [50]. To overcome the aforementioned issues,
mist, fog, and edge computing were explored for the IoT
ecosystem, which helps to ofﬂoad some communication tasks
from the cloud in order to improve latency response and node
requests [49]. Fog computing gateways and cloudlets were
added between IoT devices and the cloud to improve response
time. Mist computing devices can perform complex tasks
locally as well in collaboration with other IoT nodes, therefore,
reducing the communication overhead with the cloud [172].
Cloudlets use high-end PCs to perform computing-intensive
services and real-time rendering in the local network [49].
The fog computing gateways can provide QoS-aware, low-
latency, and physically distributed services, accordingly [172].

19

The use of these devices in communication architectures help
to achieve greener and sustainable solutions.
CFE-based Smart Circular Economy. Fraga-Lamas et al.
[49] discussed the sustainability issue in the context of smart
circular economy and Industry 5.0. The paper focuses mainly
on the reduction of carbon footprint
issue concerning re-
cycling, operating, and manufacturing processes. The study
considers CFE as one of the enabling technologies to achieve
sustainability in the Industry 5.0 ecosystem. Furthermore, the
study takes into account edge nodes in integrated with mist
computing for analyzing energy consumption and its effect on
carbon footprint. Furthermore, the impact of sustainability on
different countries has also been discussed, accordingly.

2) Three-level CFE-based IoT Architecture: Recently in
an Annual Automation Fair, Rockwell Automation (world’s
largest company for industrial automation and digital transfor-
mation) have also listed cloud-fog-edge architectures as one
of the driving forces for Industry 5.02. For the sake of gener-
ality, we can assume a three-level cloud-fog-edge-based IoT
architecture for Industry 5.0. The ﬁrst layer comprises edge
devices or IoT sensors used in the context of Industry 5.0, in-
cluding high-end vehicles, smartphones, smartwatches, smart
pendants, wearable devices, and sensor nodes. The second
layer consists of fog gateway, base stations, cloudlets, road-
side units, routers, edge servers, and proxy servers to form
edge-fog computing layer. This layer provides the essential
computation, communication, and storage capabilities for the
nodes in the ﬁrst layer. The last is the cloud computing layer
that consists of cloud server(s) and datacenter(s), respectively.
As Industry 5.0 is still
in its infancy, some studies have
been published to cover a few or a single aspect of CFE
architectures in the context of Industry 5.0. Subsequently, we
consolidate a summary of those works in this subsection.
Edge Computing as Supportive Technology. Maddikunta
et al. [47] reviewed the enabling technologies for Industry
5.0 and considered edge computing as one of the support-
ive technologies. The integration of edge computing was
discussed in the context of latency reduction rather than a
sustainable solution. According to their review, Industry 5.0
needs to be faster in response time to achieve industrial
needs, therefore, edge computing techniques are considered a
necessary building block. Similarly, ¨Ozdemir and Hekim [66]
were one of the earliest ones to discuss the implications and
diversity of Industry 5.0 through a scientiﬁc study. Although
the study discusses mostly regarding the technology policy
and adaptation,
it also emphasizes greatly on the use of
edge devices to maintain a symmetry in industrial automation,
which is one of the reasons for transition to Industry 5.0. It
also suggests that the use of edge-computing and devices is
not only limited to implement automated networks, but also
to generate pathways and linkages with the human factors in
case of hyperconnectivity failure. Since our study follows the
model proposed by EC [173], we consider CFE as one of the
building blocks to achieve sustainability concerning Industry
5.0 systems.

computing resources concerning three components of Industry 5.0 vision

Industrial IoT at the Edge. Thakur and Sehgal [48] proposed
IIoT and edge-computing based architecture that caters to
several
industrial processes and applications for heteroge-
neous smart cyber-physical systems. The processes include
hydraulic, pneumatic, and electrical, while the application
comprises dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, and voltage
frequency islands. The authors emphasized that their edge-
computing based heterogeneous architectures is in compliance
with Industry 5.0 standards as it requires minimal human
intervention. Similarly, Du et al. [50] proposed the use of the
industrial edge computing framework for fault diagnosis in the
context of Industry 5.0. The three layered architecture consist
of edge devices, edge/fog/mist servers, and cloud servers. The
study through analysis showed that the edge computing-based
framework not only reduces the computation and communi-
cation bottleneck, but also reduces the latency and helps shift
the industrial process paradigm from centralized to distributed,
respectively.

C. Nexus of CI and Cloud-Fog-Edge Computing for Human-
centric Solutions

As one of the driving forces for Industry 5.0 is mass cus-
tomization and personalization, it attracts human eccentricity
into the mix that prioritizes human interest and needs in the
production process. Industry 5.0 is also considered to be a
society-centric approach, suggesting that the technology would
adapt to the diversity and needs of workers. For example,
prioritizing the mental and physical well-being of workers can
be performed to preserve the fundamental rights of workers
while focusing on the digital privacy of acquired data.

One of the ways of well-being, relevancy, and human-machine
collaboration can be achieved is by using the combination
of CFE computing and CI. The edge devices can help in
acquiring the data from human workers in a ubiquitous way,
while the CI can analysis the data and activate relevant services
concerning the desired issue or application. Furthermore, Edge
AI (a mergence of CI and CFE computing) can also help to im-
prove human-machine collaboration by understanding action
perception in a pervasive manner. Some studies have high-
lighted the human-centricity issues in their studies (c.f. 12),
while others focused on a particular scenario and proposed a
way to realize it in current industrial environment.

1) Enabling Technologies: Maddikunta et al. [47] high-
lighted the term hyper customization that is essential to Indus-
try 5.0. The study also suggests that CI and data from edge
devices, such as, speciﬁc content, service, or product details,
are crucial to move towards the hyper customization process.
Furthermore, the study also highlights the speciﬁc preferences
of the user that can be incorporated in the manufacturing
process by utilizing user preference data from edge devices
and decision/analysis using CI. The study reveals that the
worker is a crucial aspect for achieving personalization, as
the manufacturing process must transition to an agile supply
chain and a process that requires human intervention to
customize the product accordingly. Similarly, the study [49]
undertakes an industrial scenario where humans and machines
work in collaboration. The study focuses on the safety of
human workers in a industrial environment by leveraging Edge
AI characteristics. For instance, continuous visual monitoring
could be performed in order to detect close proximity of robots

If the proximity condition is violated, an alarm
could be generated and the machine could be shut down in a
remote manner for protecting the human worker.

2) Emerging Technologies: Bhat and Alqahtani [52] linked
the vision and key performance indicators of 6G with Industry
5.0 to achieve hyper personalization. It should be noted that
both the aforementioned technologies heavily rely on edge
computing and CI. According to the study, the use of Internet-
of-Everything (IoE), extended Reality, 4D imaging, brain-
computer interface (BCI), haptic communication, holography,
and telepresence would heavily contribute to personalized
systems and automation. The importance of this study can be
taken into account by recent developments in the aforemen-
tioned technologies from Facebook (Meta)3.
Some studies [51], [53], [58] have hypothesized that EdgeAI
that drives 6G communication systems would contribute a
lot to Industry 5.0 in terms of personalization, human-centric
services, and real-time management systems. For instance,
Wang et al. [53], proposed an AI-powered 6G layered archi-
tecture that uses EdgeAI and ensures the delivery of intelligent
services to Industry 5.0. The architecture is heavily based on
explainable AI (XAI) for not only understanding the logic
behind activation of differentiated services, but also how they
related to the end-users, which will be helpful for legal
auditors and service providers to customize their products and
equipment, accordingly. Shahzadi et al. [51] proposed the use
of 6G services in manufacturers based on Industry 5.0 to not
only leverage EdgeAI analytics, but also 6G communication
systems to increase collaboration and cognitive communica-
tion between humans and machines to provide personalized
user experience and improved service quality. Similarly, Nayak
and Patgiri [58] corresponded to the transition of Industry 4.0
(Digitalization) to Industry 5.0 (Personalization) with Edge AI
and 6G communication systems. The study highlights several
issues concerning data heterogeneity, security, privacy, and
mobility in the context of Industry 5.0. The study highlighted
that the convergence of Industry 5.0 and 6G communication
systems would result in an improved Industry 5.0 (Intelligenti-
zation) that could be drive a paradigm shift in the technological
industry.

3) Ethical and Value Oriented Industries: Saeid Nahavandi
[64] highlighted several aspects and issues concerning human-
centricity in Industry 5.0. For instance, the study highlights
that new jobs and positions such as chief robotic ofﬁce
(CRO) could be created in every industry as human-machine
collaboration will have a high signiﬁcance in Industry 5.0
ecosystem. Furthermore, the study also highlights the impor-
tance of virtual training to update the skills of the workforce
in a simulated environment or remotely, that does not affect
the real-time manufacturing process. The study suggests that
the role of Edge AI in developing such kind of systems
would be highly crucial. The study emphasized on machine
cognition and sensing technologies to build a cobots-based
systems for improving the quality and accuracy of assistive
tasks in industrial environment.

21

4) Emotional Intelligence: The study in [56] explored the
concept of emotional intelligence in the context of Industry
5.0. The study considered emotional intelligence from two
different perspectives. The ﬁrst is the use of emotional in-
telligence as a soft skill to prepare the human workforce
for machine collaboration in the Industry 5.0 ecosystem. The
second aspect is to analyze the emotions and expressions of
humans while working with robots to avoid and deal with
stressful situation. The study suggested that CI with wearable
devices can be used to recognize emotions and expressions to
address both of the aforementioned aspects. Similarly, Longo
et al. [59] used the term ”Age of Augmentation” interchange-
ably with Industry 5.0. They proposed a value-sensitive design
framework to elicit human values in the factory of the future
concerning the human-machine symbiosis. Moreover, studies
such as [56], [65] focused speciﬁcally on the human-robot sys-
tems and highlighted several issues concerning administrative,
organizational, regulatory,
legal, psychological, social, and
ethical issues within Industry 5.0 ecosystem. The studies dive
into the consequences of adopting human-robot collaboration
and suggest some possible solutions to avoid mishaps in terms
of physiological and mental well-being of workers.

D. Nexus of CI and Cloud-Fog-Edge Computing for Resiliency

The importance of resilience was highlighted during the
COVID-19 pandemic that challenged the economic resilience
concerning industry perspective. In its report, the European
Commission [173], [174] highly emphasized the resilience
to social, economic, and production stabilization in Industry
5.0. For example, the issue of industrial process recovery and
manufacturing recovery has been discussed and touched on in
an abstract manner in [47], [49] while highlighting the use of
CI and edge computing as its key enablers. In this regard, We
consolidate the studies addressing resilience in Industry 5.0
below.

1) Energy: The study [170] discusses resilience in Industry
5.0 in a very brief manner in the context of SDG goals
proposed by the UN4. This study corresponds mainly to
resilience in Industry 5.0 to the 11th (SDG), that is, sustainable
cities and communities, which are compliant with both reports
of the European Commission [173], [174], accordingly.

2) Enabling Technologies: In [25], the authors considered
the technology enablers for Industry 5.0 and carried out an
extensive review for the evaluation and ranking of the enablers,
accordingly. The study developed a criterion for inclusion and
selection of technology enablers, followed by its evaluation via
Pythagorean fuzzy Delphi method. The ranking of technology
enablers was then carried out using a Pythagorean fuzzy
analytical hierarchical process by calculating and assigning
weights accordingly. The study also provided implications in
terms of case studies and several prepositions to improve the
Industry 5.0 adoption process.

3) Security: The following studies refer mainly to security
and privacy concerns when addressing resilience in Industry
5.0.

• In [50], authors proposed a collect-reduce-aggregate-collect-
aggregate-update (CRACAU) method that use edge com-
puting and Byzantine machine learning algorithm to meet
industrial automation requirements concerning Industry 5.0.
The study highlighted that fault tolerance is one of the
issues that will always be addressed irrespective of the
industrial generation being followed; however, due to the
employment of heterogeneous devices, the security aspect
becomes crucial and can affect the overall production of
the industry. In this regard, they proposed the CRACAU
framework to not only improve automation processes but
also enhance the resiliency and privacy through Byzantine-
tolerant algorithm.

• In [44],

the study highlighted the problem of data and
model security when it comes to NGWNs and its associated
advancements such as Industry 5.0. The study highlighted
several security concerns that are dealt when performing
data acquisition and data analysis on edge devices in indus-
trial environment. The study proposed a Private AI-based
framework that not only addresses data but also model se-
curity that has not been taken into account concerning fourth
and ﬁfth industrial revolutions. The study also proposes
a data security mechanism for industrial environments to
secure the data ﬂow, accordingly.
While the aforementioned study proposed data and model
security but performed evaluation on the data modality, only,
the study in [45] dealt with the model security aspect. Al-
though the study focuses mainly on IoMT data, the authors
suggest that the model security framework can be applied to
the Industry 5.0 environment, as model security is one of
the emerging issues and can affect industries heavily when
humans and edge devices are hyperconnected. The study
proposed a proximal gradient based learning networks that
could help to cope with model inversion attacks, respectively.
Similarly, Rupa et al. [54] also emphasized on the medical
industries concerning Industry 5.0 and proposed the use of
blockchain networks for data protection. The study employed
remix Ethereum blockchain to protect and manage medical
certiﬁcates on edge computing devices. Furthermore, the study
tested their method on distributed applications using the RPC-
based Ethereum blockchain and agents in a simulated envi-
ronment.

E. Nexus of CI and Cloud-Fog-Edge Computing for Sustain-
ability

Existing studies have highly focused on the use of Edge AI,
i.e., a fusion of CI and CFE computing to achieve the required
level of sustainability. Below is a consolidation of some
studies that focus mainly on sustainability using Edge AI in
Industry 5.0. We have divided the studies concerning Industry
5.0 sustainability in few categories such as energy, robotics,
manufacturing, enabling technologies, emerging technologies,
and generalized studies (as illustrated in 12).

1) Energy: The studies [169] and [170] focused on the
energy crisis, energy requirement, and sustainable develop-
ment goals in the context of Industry 5.0. The former study
to support fusion of
emphasized geopolitical

involvement

22

energy sources to control global emissions and achieve a
sustainable Industry 5.0 solution. The latter study focused
on the use of bioenergy through byproduct generation and
algae culture for achieving a sustainable solution. Both studies
emphasize the use of CI techniques to achieve their respective
goals. For instance, the study [169] emphasizes the use of
CI not only for the automation process, but also to explore
the possible combination for the fusion of energy sources.
On the other hand, the study [170] utilized CI techniques in
conjunction with the prototype of the electro-optical systems
bioreactor to reduce carbon emissions for manufacturers in
Industry 5.0. The study suggested that Algae Industry could
provide alternate solutions for renewable energy sources in the
context of Industry 5.0.

2) Robotics: In [65], Demir et al. speciﬁed that the main
purpose of Industry 5.0 is to achieve sustainability and pursue
the bioeconomy through the means of renewable resources,
bionics, robotics, and CI. The study suggests that the CI is
the key to enable the co-work between human and robots as
well as develop a sustainable working ecosystem in the context
of Industry 5.0. The study also highlights the issues that can
occur due to the involvement of human and robots.

3) Manufacturing: The authors in [43] explored different
aspects of Industry 5.0 for manufacturing systems that include
green manufacturing, smart manufacturing, intelligent mon-
itoring, process automation, warehouse ergonomics, product
development, and economic impact. Most of the chapters,
focused on the feasibility and impact of Industry 5.0 based
manufacturing systems on the sustainability. Meanwhile, some
chapters also emphasized on using CI and edge computing to
move towards green computation and circular economy that
could help in reducing the carbon emissions, accordingly.
Farsi et al. [46] evaluated Industry 5.0 indicators for their
feasibility in reliable centered maintenance. They suggested
that a high correlation between maintenance and operation
phases could achieve sustainability for high-value equipment
from the industry 5.0 perspective. The study uses fuzzy logic
and edge equipment to measure the impact of reliable, centered
maintenance on sustainability. Furthermore,
the study also
suggests recommendations to improve sustainability through
the said indicators.

4) Enabling Technologies: Fraga-Lamas et al. [49] pro-
posed the use of Edge AI and G-IoT systems to address
issues of carbon footprint. The study proposed hypothetical
architecture based on Edge AI and green IoT and performs
evaluation in terms of energy efﬁciency to show that such
a fusion can be helpful in reducing carbon emissions. The
evaluated scenario is considered in the context of Industry 5.0
and it was suggested that the use of CI and edge computing
can be helpful in mitigating sustainability issues. Maddikunta
et al. [47] also emphasized sustainability in Industry 5.0 and
highlighted the use of CFE computing and the CI technique
to reduce the carbon footprints from manufacturing industries.

5) Emerging Technologies: Although some studies have
not directly proposed sustainability in Industry 5.0 using
they have indirectly addressed the use cases of
Edge AI,
techniques that use both CI and edge computing, accordingly.

23

Fig. 13. Softwarized communication of physical twins and deployed digital twins over a zero-touch TSN-enabled hybrid NIBs architecture of CI-NGWNs.

For instance, Nayak and Patgiri [58] proposed a hypothetical
architecture for 6G communication that is based primarily
on computational intelligence and edge computing techniques.
6G is essentially known for a larger footprint and sustainable
communication, therefore, some of the use cases highlight its
correspondence with Industry 5.0, assuming that 6G could
carry on its sustainable traits to the manufacturing domain as
well. Similarly, Shahzadi et al. [51] proposed a collaborative
cognitive communication system that uses CI and CFE com-
puting as its core to enable intelligent services. Furthermore,
the main aspect of the system was to leverage the contextual
information to activate a particular service. The study shows
that one of the use cases of their proposed system is sustainable
energy for Industry 5.0.

VII. POTENTIAL ENABLING SERVICES FOR INDUSTRY 5.0

This section covers the potential examples of enabling
services that are supported by multi-tenant softwarized service
framework (as shown in Fig. 5) to address the challenges of
Industry 5.0 vision.

A. Services for TSN-enabled Hybrid NIBs Architecture

The multi-tenant softwarized architecture can combine the
diverse enabling service functions (discussed in Sec. IV) to

provision composite and uniﬁed services for diverse appli-
cations. For example, Fig. 13 illustrates the TSN-enabled
hybrid NIBs infrastructure that combines the CI-NGWNs
infrastructure and backhaul hyperconverged industrial network
for providing reliable and secure communication and com-
putation services to the interconnected machine cells on the
physical manufacturing ﬂoor [175]–[177]. The convergence
of softwarized architecture over TSN-enabled hybrid NIBs
can beneﬁt the CI-NGWNs in providing scalable, agile, and
ﬂexible services for the required technological enablers of the
Industry 5.0 vision. Some of the other signiﬁcances are,
1) It can provide the signiﬁcance of seamless integration
between both public cloud (e.g., B5G/6G, third party ven-
dors) and private cloud (on-premise) in hybrid NIBs. More
enterprises are moving towards the options of both public
and private cloud according to the business ecosystem.
2) With the integration of TSN standards, a promising enabler
standardized by 3GPP, hybrid NIBs can enable holistic soft-
warized communications for industrial automation and con-
trol applications with satisfying critical requirements, e.g.,
time synchronization, bounded latency, ultra-reliability, and
dedicated resource allocations.

Additionally, other potential required services can be orches-
trated and deployed to enable critical applications, e.g., CaaS,
IaaS, and AI-as-a-Service can be deployed at CI-NGWNs

network management and control over the entire TSN-enabled
NIBs architecture. Some of the potential enabling services are
explored in the following subsections.

B. Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS)

Also called anything-as-a-service that combines tradi-
tional on-premises, software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-
a-service (PaaS), and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) model
according to the hierarchy of control and management over
computational and communication resources,
identiﬁed in
Fig. 14. The XaaS paradigms has led to the massive shift
in leveraging subscription-based business models closely inte-
grated with the “servitization” in emerging enterprises, i.e.,
nexus of softwarized products with the on-demand service
models in a single package [178]–[180]. Hence depending
upon the type of XaaS servitization model and subscription,
the CI-enabled NGWN can provide the wide range of service
advantages, e.g.,
1) Communication and computation services to the numerous

human-centric robotic industrial processes

2) Financial savings, and improved productivity for small

enterprises

3) High efﬁciency in terms of hybrid cloud-edge management,
i.e., service request automation, cost management and re-
source optimization, secure identity and compliance during
product lifecycle, governance in package and deliverance
procedure

4) System backup and cybersecurity without exorbitant costs
5) Agile, scalable and growth-oriented enterprise with inte-

grated evolving technologies and softwares.
Similarly, the emerging trend in the softwarization of net-
works is paving the way for new hybrid XaaS paradigms [181],
[182], such as integration of disaster recovery and uniﬁed
communication-as-a-service, zero-touch network monitoring
services, container-as-a-service, health-care-as-a-service, etc.,
This can be beneﬁcial for the new vision provided for core
elements in Industry 5.0.

C. Network Function-as-a-Service (NFaaS)

The symbiosis of NFV and SDN technologies within the
TSN-enabled hybrid NIB architecture and their nexus with
the enabling networking techniques, e.g., network programma-
bility, virtualization/containerization, and emerging AI-native
SBA paradigm, facilitates the leverageable zero-touch network
functionalities, i.e., service-aware communications, network
management, and control, and visual services [183], [184].
For this purpose (as illustrated in Fig. 13), the control plane
of NGWN collects the network state information and network
ﬂow information from the underlying core of hybrid NIBs
and trains the AI models in run time to intelligently man-
age the softwarized network using network control signals.
Similarly, utilizing the composite enabling functions of the
CI and infrastructure layers (c.f. Fig. 5) also forms the
building blocks for providing network functions-as-a-services
(NFaaS) to aid the service-based provisioning architecture

24

Fig. 14. Various servitization frameworks that can be adopted in TSN-enabled
hybrid NIBs architecture

in industry 5.0 scenarios. Some examples of the NFaaS are
NFV Infrastructure-as-a-Service (NFVIaaS), Virtual Network
Function-as-a-Service (VNFaaS), and Virtual Network-as-a-
Service (VNaaS) paradigms.
Slice-as-a-Service (SlaaS). NFaaS also forms an building
block for network slicing in the hybrid NIB architecture,
enabling the network vendor/operator to tailor their network
infrastructure and aims to provide a portion of network
resources as a slices for diverse tenants [185], [186], e.g.,
hybrid eMBB-URLLC-mMTC trafﬁcs, e-health, private en-
terprise networks connected vehicles, etc. This introduces a
new business models where long-term agreements can be
made between network operators and diverse tenants, and
provides a sustainable network slice-as-a-service (SlaaS) to
meet the on-demand diverse requirements and network trafﬁc
characteristics.

D. AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS)

Earlier numerous enterprises were not considering AI due
to, 1) expensive cost on massive hardware/machines (infras-
tructure), 2) short supply of technical programmers who can
operate over available infrastructure (human resources), and 3)
lack of sufﬁcient data [85], [187]. However, the exponential
growth in hybrid cloud services has led to the adoption
trend towards AI as it becomes more feasible to use because
of inﬁnite data collection and service availability. AI-as-a-
Service (AIaaS) can provide remote AI tools enabling emerg-
ing enterprises to implement and scale AI techniques [188].
Moreover, it provides various on-demand AI-native functions

Computations. Advanced AI techniques such as Deep RL,
Swarm AI, etc., needs high computation to train on data
and converge towards optimal solutions [8]. As a part of an
extension to the XaaS paradigm (c.f. Fig. 14), numerous cloud,
telecom, and private vendors in AIaaS setup can offer a com-
bination of GPU-CPU-based VMs and containers (IaaS) which
is based on a pay-as-you-go model to offer infrastructure-
based high computations tasks, such as, zero-touch self-
automated AI
tasks, perform serial/parallel processing in
batch and streaming analytic, serverless computations, etc,.
Together they form a compute-as-a-service (CaaS) in hybrid
NIBs (c.f. Fig. 13), which can easily be availed on-demand
and scaled by enterprises since maintaining and owning a
dedicated infrastructure (on-premises) can be cost expensive
for an emerging factory ecosystem. Under the Industry 5.0
vision, it allows the space for investing spare capital on other
goals of human sustainability [49], e.g., health, human-robots
collaboration, digital skills among workers.

2) AI Tools: AI tools help the enterprise developers team
to develop and access the various on-demand AI services and
other associated services (i.e., IaaS, CaaS, NFVaaS), which
are entirely in sync with data and compute platforms.
Wizards & IDE. The nexus of wizards (software) together
with the integrated development environment (IDEs) and
browser-based notebooks enables real-time back/front-end de-
velopment in a multi-tenant softwarized environment and pro-
vides ease by reducing complexity in training AI frameworks
team [193]. Such AI tools
for an enterprise management
facilitate the smooth DevOps processes in smart industrial
applications.
Data Engineering Tools. The quality of AI data determines
the performance of any trained AI model [194]. Hence,
the cleansing and pre-processing of collected raw data are
essential for which data preparation tools have the utmost
importance as advanced data tools help extract-transform-load
(ETL) jobs, sophisticated data automation, increase the data
value, perform feature engineering, and fuse speciﬁc critical
data, i.e., data fusion [195]. The extracted data are then fed
into the ML pipelines for model training, provided by third-
party orchestrated and deployed applications, e.g., Kubeﬂow.
Kubeﬂow supports wizards, IDEs, and deployable and scalable
ML/DL workﬂows over the softwarized microservice architec-
ture, easily integrated with the CaaS model [85].
AI Libraries. In the data science environment, the conﬁg-
uration and setting up of ML and DL libraries, such as
TensorFlow, Apache MXNet, Torch, Keras, Scikit-learn, etc.,
has become quite complicated, especially with the emerging
updates and patches updates over time [196]. Numerous ready-
to-go VMs and containers templates are set and conﬁgured
with necessary ML/DL libraries with GPU-supported AI com-
putations, which can be provided to train and implement
complex neural networks.

3) AI Service APIs and Types: Numerous cloud vendors
provide different types of standalone customer service APIs
that can be readily deployed since they do not require ded-
icated custom-designed AI models as beneﬁts are extracted
from the underlying AI infrastructure. Some of the emerging
AI service types are given below.

(ACF) to various industrial processes (c.f. Sec. IV). This brings
numerous advantages, e.g.,

• Minimizing the investment risks with cost ﬂexibility
• Less dependency over expertise in ﬁeld of data analytics and
ML while staying focused on the core of enterprise business
• Gain beneﬁts from the information extracted from critical
data, resulting in transparency and manoeuvrability im-
provement over future course of strategic actions in digital
enterprise to increase productivity.

According to the Flexera report on the wide-scale AI
adoption in ﬁeld companies, almost 28% of enterprises are
reported to test-trial with AI/ML techniques while 46% of
enterprises are planning to go for the test-trial experiments in
their enterprises ecosystem [189]. To enable real time AIaaS
architecture, there are generally three essential components
which is illustrated in Fig. 15. Further details to the essential
components are as follow.

1) AI Infrastructure: AI infrastructure forms the backbone
structure to keep implementing and training multiple AI-native
models and functions (c.f. Sec.IV-A2). Data storages and
computations form the critical pillar of AI infrastructure.
Data. AI data from multiple sources has utmost
impor-
tance at the AFL due to its reliance on trained AI models.
These data are fed as input to the AI models, which can
come from numerous types of databases, i.e., 1) relational
databases management systems (RDBMS) that offer data
storage functions possessing security, accuracy, integrity, and
consistency [190], 2) stored raw data in data lakes [191], and
3) unstructured large binary objects and stored annotation in
NoSQL databases [192]. Similarly real-time data processing
and streaming techniques, e.g., Apache Spark and Kafka, has
a scalable ML library that works in parallel with databases to
store collected raw data [85].

Chatbots and digital/virtual
assistance in integration with collaborative robots (cobots) can
perform the tasks automatically and intelligently in collabora-
tion with human workers [197]. They generally use natural
language processing (NLP) and perceptual image processing
algorithms on voice, text, and image data to learn from human
beings and imitate the language and human behavior pattern to
provide answers and assistance [198]. Enterprises can leverage
and integrate AI-based bots and assistance services over the
whole factory ecosystem to fulﬁll the vision of Industry 5.0
by bridging the gap between humans and robots towards the
digital revolution [199]. Moreover, developers can use these
types of AI services in orchestrated industrial xApps to assist
in monitoring and controlling applications.
Cognitive Computing APIs. Cognitive computing is a tech-
nology that imitates human thought processes, personality,
and sentiments, which helps in real-time analysis of the
environment and making the best-possible appropriate deci-
sion [200]. The concept of chatbots and digital assistants is
part of the cognitive computing products. Various services
use cognitive computing APIs as representational state transfer
(REST) endpoints— a way for services to communicate with
each other [201]. Without developing the application code
from scratch, the REST endpoints are accessed by enterprise
developers and integrated into the custom industrial applica-
tion/services they are building [202]. Some examples of the
cognitive computing APIs are 1) NLP, 2) speech recognition,
3) image recognition, 4) pattern recognition, 4) knowledge
extraction, 5) searching, 5) emotion detection.
Fully Managed AI Frameworks as a Services. Various ML
and AI frameworks (e.g., Deep DL, neural networks, etc.)
can be provided on-demand to the enterprise developers that
automatically learn and build on the incoming data and evolve
with time [203]. For example, at the CI-enabled NGWNs
control plane, various AI models are provided as disjoint
services that take the underlying network’s state information
to learn and build and select an appropriate control policy
to provide zero-touch network functions. Similarly, enterprise
developers can utilize various intelligent functions using vari-
ous AI model templates and drag-and-drop tools to assist with
more customized and fully automated AI-based applications.
Custom Computing. With the rise of different
industrial
applications and scenarios having diverse communication and
computation requirements, various cloud vendors are moving
towards providing custom APIs that serve the purpose of
specialized custom services [204]. This strategy results in
lessening the overhead of selecting the suitable algorithm and
networked computation resources that suit the on-demand QoS
and QoE performance.
Cost-effective Sustainable and Green Computing Design.
Cost-effective green computing or environment-friendly com-
puting design has taken the utmost importance for a sustain-
able future [205]. It introduces novel solutions to protect the
environment and achieve the goal of net-zero carbon emission.
The aims of green computing are [206], 1) introduction of
management and policies to reduce the energy consumption
and carbon footprint of the enabling ICT technologies to
perform computations while reducing the costs, 2) promote

energy-efﬁcient and eco-friendly networking products (hard-
ware and software), 3) reduce the power consumption in ma-
chines, and 4) use minimum computation and communication
resources in all types of M2M communications. By adopting
green computing approaches, using AI models in the DevOps
operations for the factory softwarized environment can provide
green-computing-enabled cost-effective services to achieve
various SDG goals in Industry 5.0 applications [207].
Affective Computing. According to the author, Rosalind
Picard, of ”Affective computing” [208], the computers must
be provided the capability to have recognition, understanding,
and tenancy of emotions and expression, in case we want
computers to possess high intelligence and interact naturally
with us. The recent advancements in AI algorithms (cog-
nitive computing, conversational AI, emotional intelligence)
and robotics (i.e., cobots for zero-defect manufacturing) and
convergence of multidisciplinary ﬁelds, i.e., engineering, psy-
chology, education, cognitive science, sociology, and others,
have brought forth the new demanding vertical applications in
human-computer interactions and affective computing [209].
These new vertical applications are human health, computer-
assisted AR-VR-XR technologies, entertainment, factories-of-
the-future, etc. Similarly, the integration of affective mediation
technologies and the assistive tools using AR-VR-XR into the
FoFs ecosystem can signiﬁcantly help assist disabled workers
during their daily experience.

E. Connected Digital Twin Services and Metaverse

The world has eventually reached a point where almost
every technology is deeply embedded in our lives,
lead-
ing to the blurriness among lines between business (factory
production, big enterprise) and personal (factory workforce,
employees) [8].

1) Digital Twin-as-a-Service (DTaaS): In this regard, the
emerging industrial digital
twins bridge the physical and
virtual space of factory assets and form a digital replica of the
factory through IIoT and CPS-enabled cobots in nexus with

technologies (i.e., blockchain, CV, distributed networks, pervasive computing, and ubiquitous interfaces); and (Right) the metaverse ecosystem features (i.e.,
avatars, content creation, data interoperability, security/privacy, trust, and others).

CI-NGWNs as a hyperconnectivity medium that can optimize
and interact with the physical environment autonomously [78],
[81], [82]. Similarly, the symbiotic role of industrial DTs
along with cognitive AI-based sensing paradigms, AR-VR-
XR, and blockchain, accelerates towards realizing true dig-
ital
transformation that can perform a wide range of on-
demand functions and provide services, such as DT services
for automated health services, industrial assets, optimizing
B5G/6G networks, matrix productions. Especially the factory
workforce such as disabled persons with blind or visually
impaired disabilities needs to have the proper care in terms of
stress management and trauma management, which forms an
essential condition for the all-inclusive digital and sustainable
future under Industry 5.0 vision. Moreover, DT technology can
be utilized as standalone services, forming a DT-as-a-service
(DTaaS) paradigm to provide numerous digital services [210],
such as visualization and insights, status monitoring, process
optimization, automated control, fault prediction, remote con-
trol maintenance, etc. Likewise, DT capabilities can enable
true mass customization and personalization in matrix pro-
ductions to achieve sustainable goals of zero-defect manufac-
turing. The two phases, i.e., DT training and implementation,
of autonomous DT creation together with the deep learning
method has been illustrated in Fig. 16.

2) Metaverse: Recently,

the term “metaverse”— digital
“big bang” of digital-native cyberspace, has been introduced
to promote and streamline the digitizing of each physical real-
ity [211], e.g., devices, people, processes, buildings, vehicles,
etc. The essence of metaverse lies in the vision of shared
digital-native realms of cyberspace, connected by the gigantic,
immersive, uniﬁed, persistent, and sustainable Internet at its
core, forming the mesh web of virtual worlds or digital twins
which enables true digital transformation [212], [213]. It is
noted that true implementations of metaverse may seem fu-
turistic at the moment, especially concerning its integration in

the intelligent factory ecosystem. However, various emerging
and enabling technologies are poised to catalyze metaverse
formation. Fig. 17 shows the various enabling technologies
and their critical functional role in the metaverse realization.

the digital

3R’s of Digital Twins and Metaverse. The interplay of
working roles, relationships, and requirements (3R’s) between
the digital twin and digital-native virtual world determines
the actual realization and implementation of the metaverse
vision [214]. Fig. 17 shows the three stages for metaverse
development, i.e., 1) digital twin implementation of physical
space, 2) creation of mesh-networked digital-native virtual
worlds, and 3) dual nexus of both digital
twins and the
digital-native virtual world towards the metaverse creation.
As a starting point,
twin digitizes and creates
the virtual
image of physical environments, providing the
capability to project any physical world changes upon its
virtual counterpart. For different environments and physical
spaces/processes that encompass surroundings, digital
twin
technology creates many unique and distinct digital-native
virtual worlds, which initially suffer from, 1)limited inter-
connectivity among themselves and with physical worlds,
and 2) information silos, i.e., communication between unre-
lated virtual images is difﬁcult/impossible. Humans, intelligent
agents, or devices can interact and work on different creations
as different digital avatars within the build-up of digital-native
images. The emerging trends towards the adoption of vari-
ous enabling technologies and increased sharing/connection
of many virtual worlds within a massive digital landscape
have led to the convergence of the digitized real world and
created meshed virtual world [215]. With this convergence,
the ﬁnal stage of the interconnected reality of the physical and
virtual world arises where the hyperconnectivity barrier has
been reduced, and simultaneous co-existence of both physical-
virtual entities entails much like surreality. It leads to the
perpetually connected and 3D cyber-reality as the metaverse.

performance drastically reduces with the atmospheric condi-
tions, such as rain, snow, and fog, limiting LIDAR ranging
performance in outdoor scenarios [223]. On the other hand, a
range of wireless localization technologies is available, which
are practically used for different scenarios and applications
(c.f. Fig. 18). GPS-based localization is not suitable for indoor
scenarios since the GPS signals get severely attenuated due
to the rich multipath scatterer proﬁle of the indoor factory
environment [224]. On the other hand, other ranging solutions
based on WiFi, RFID, ZigBee, LoRaWAN, and Bluetooth
for indoor scenarios are developed over time, providing good
accurate positioning services in indoor factory scenarios [28],
[225]. However, ultra-wideband (UWB)-based localization so-
lution, especially with a large bandwidth of 500 MHz and
1 GHz in 3.1–10.6 GHz band, provides much accurate local-
ization and ranging performance over other available wireless
technologies. Recent development in the use of mmWave and
THz band with massive MIMO and beamforming technologies
for high datarates communications in B5G and 6G increases
the importance of mmWave/THz-based localization to provide
integrated communication and ranging (ICAR) services [226].
Localization and Ranging Techniques/Algorithms. Conven-
tional wireless localization and ranging techniques worked on
the measurements of received signal properties [227], e.g., 1)
received signal strength information is used in the RSSI-based
localization schemes, 2) received signal angular information,
i.e., angle-of-arrival (AoA) and angle-of-departure (AoD),
are used on AoA/AoD-based localization schemes, and 3)
received signal time-of-ﬂight (ToF) information is used in
time-of-arrival (ToA)-based localization schemes. ToA/TDoA-
based localization algorithms generally performed better than
the RSSI- and AoA/AoD-based algorithms in indoor factory
scenarios since their performance is more affected due to
thick-wall penetration losses and human blockages, machines
and factory assets, and angular scatterers structures [226].
However, multipath structure indeed induces erroneous errors
in the positioning accuracies due to the absence of direct-path
(DP) in line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. Hybrid algorithms—
the combination of conventional localization techniques, e.g.,
RSSI-ToA, gives better performance than the standalone al-
gorithms [220]. Nevertheless,
increases the ranging and
localization algorithm complexity. For URLLC and mMTC
services in mission-critical industrial applications, timing syn-
chronization among the industrial assets (wireless and wired)
at the physical layer is very important [144]. At the 5G RAN
level, 5G gNBs wirelessly disseminate the absolute reference
time and physical propagation delay information for adjusting
the timing clocks at the UE level [228]. This increases the
criticality of accurate positioning of industrial assets in a rich
multipath indoor environment. Kalman ﬁlters and AI-enhanced
localization algorithms are also developed over time to per-
form joint positioning and time synchronization and better
UE navigational tracking in a realistic environment [229]. For
M2M and D2D communication scenarios, a cooperative local-
ization approach is adopted in the worst conditions (e.g., geo-
graphic positioning fails) where multiple wirelessly connected
industrial sensors and assets communicate and collaborate to
improve the accuracy of position estimates [230].

signiﬁcance have been identiﬁed in Fig. 17.

F. Navigation/Tracking-as-a-Service (NTaaS)

Navigation/Tracking-as-a-Service (NTaaS),

together with
the cloud-based infrastructure, can offer on-demand localiza-
tion services to the retail and manufacturing sector, supply
chain, transportation, healthcare, and logistic industries [216],
[217]. These services include navigationally tracking, main-
taining real-time location information, and factory assets man-
agement, e.g., industrial cobots, AGVs, isochronous factory
operations, environment sensing, and many other industrial
applications. Moreover, the exponential rise in the adoption of
ICT-based digital infrastructure across the factory ecosystem
has brought forth the surge in the usage of NTaaS to drive
enhanced productivity, revenue growth, and optimize ﬁnancial
efﬁciency, fulﬁlling the sustainability goals of the Industry 5.0
vision. The critical parts of NTaaS systems include [218]–
[220], 1) suitable localization techniques, e.g., ToA, RSSI, etc.,
2) localization system integration, e.g., optical and wireless
systems, and 3) optimization and performance enhancement
techniques, i.e., tracking algorithms, Kalman ﬁlters, neural
networks, etc.
Enabling Localization Technologies. Numerous enabling
technologies, such as light and wireless technologies, are
used for localization and ranging purposes over time [221].
The selection of the suitable localization technology for user-
deﬁned operations and applications generally depends on
the performance metrics needed, e.g., accuracy, precision,
complexity, scalability, robustness, and cost. LIDAR (light
detection and ranging) is based on optical sensor technology
which measures and senses the environment and distance
range based on laser reﬂections [222]. They are typically used
in AGVs applications (e.g., manufacturing warehouses, cell-
based matrix productions) since they are compact, accurate,
and more reliable than wireless-based localization technolo-
gies. However, they are primarily high costly, and their ranging

OPEN STANDARDS, FRAMEWORKS, PROJECT
DEMOS, GROUPS

To the best of our knowledge, most of the working related to
Industry 5.0 guidelines, standards, and frameworks have been
carried out by European Union (EU).

A. EU Publications

So far, the EU has published over 4 articles explicitly to
advance the operations and realization of Industry 5.0. The
ﬁrst was the result from a workshop with Europe’s Technology
leaders where a discussion with funding agencies, technology,
and research organizations was carried out [231]. Most of
the focus was deviated towards the identiﬁcation of enabling
technologies that could realized the concept of Industry 5.0
along with the challenges. The publication considered individ-
ualized human-machine-interaction, bio-inspired technologies
and smart materials, digital twins, emerging communication
techniques for data transmission, data storage and analysis,
AI, and technologies that can achieve autonomy, renewability,
and energy efﬁciency. Furthermore, the challenges such as
scalability, economic dimension, interdisciplinarity, govern-
mental and political dimension, and social dimensions were
also undertaken, accordingly.

The second publication in the series complemented Industry
4.0 paradigm and provided a pathway for its transition to ﬁfth
industrial iteration and ﬁrst industrial evolution. Apparently,
the focus was to make a transition from shareholder to stake-
holder value for making industries resilient, human-centric,
and sustainable [173]. The publication discussed in detail the
beneﬁts for industries and workers in order to adapt Industry
5.0 guidelines. For instance, the guidelines for skilling, re-
skilling, up-skilling, inclusive and safe work environment, and
role of industry worker were deﬁned. Similarly, to motivate in-
dustries, some beneﬁts including increased resilience, resource
efﬁciency for competitiveness and sustainability, and retaining
as well as attracting talents were elaborated.

The most recent one considers the perspective of industries
as well as recent challenges including the pandemic, biodi-
versity collapse, and climate change. The guidelines in this
recent report mainly focus on the transformation rather than
transition [174]. The report consists of three segments, i.e.,
vision, governance, and action. The vision for Industry 5.0
was discussed to achieve Europe’s 2030 goals by focusing
on responsible ecosystem and value chain, regenerative circu-
lar economy design, adaptive and self-sustaining industries,
decentralization to achieve sustainability and resilience, re-
specting planetary boundaries by limiting digitalization, and
regulatory frameworks. The governance focuses on horizon-
tal and vertical coherence with international standards and
government
levels, corporate governance 5.0, and role of
government for Industry 5.0 transformation. Lastly, an action
plan was proposed what needs to be achieved and who will
strive to achieve it. The main course of action plan was
to deﬁne the role of industries, economic orientation and
approaches to improve industry performance, new design for
supply chains, value chains, and business models, digital
transformation while respecting planetary boundaries, policy

29

making, and approaches and capabilities to innovation and
research. Together these EU publications deﬁne most of the
standards and provide guidelines for the transition and trans-
formation of Industry 5.0.

B. EU Infographs on Industry 5.0

Next, the EU published an infographic that can be char-
acterized by going beyond proﬁt based services and goods
production. The infographic emphasized more on societal
contribution from the perspective of industries and suggests
to place the health and well-being of the worker ﬁrst [232].
The key elements of the infographic was to highlight the
digitilization concerning Industry 4.0, its transition towards
Industry 5.0, highlighting its importance in terms of reduced
cost (resource efﬁciency), empowered workers (remaining in
control), competitive industry (attracting talent), adaptation
(training for evolving skills), competitive edge (new markets),
and safety and well-being of the workers. It also highlights
three core funding strategies through which Industry 5.0 can
be uplifted,
i.e. Beyond 4.0, HuMan Manufacturing, and
KYKLOS 4.0. Beyond 4.0 mainly concerns the technological
impact on welfare, business models, and jobs. HuMan Manu-
facturing focuses on the automation, factory workers, and their
collaboration for increased safety, satisfaction, performance,
quality, harmony, and productivity, respectively. KYKLOS 4.0
concerns about the circular manufacturing by focusing on
AI-based methods, augmented reality, life-cycle assessment,
product life-cycle management, and cyber-physical systems.

C. Projects and Demos

Below, we highlight some of the completed and ongoing
projects that either explicitly worked/working on Industry 5.0
or closely related to Industry 5.0 guidelines.

1) Incobotics: One of the recent projects that was com-
pleted concerning Industry 5.0 was ”Incobotics” (2019 - 2021)
that was funded by Erasmus+ programme. The funding united
four EU partners, i.e. Spain, Greece, Italy, and France for
the development of didactic materials that could be used to
design collaborative robots (CoBots). The main objective of
this project were to raise awareness concerning the evolution
of Industry, enhance pool of skilled workers, and increase
collaboration between educational centers and Industry. The
modules designed by Incobotics are currently undergoing tests
from the pilot groups in Italy, France, and Spain. Once the ﬁnal
products are reviewed and tested, they will be made freely
available for downloading from their project website [233].

2) Industry 5.0: Inclusive design methodologies for digital
manufacturing: A project ”Industry 5.0: Inclusive design
methodologies for digital manufacturing” (Sep 2021 - Feb
2025) is aligned with the Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council’s (EPSRC) project ”Made Smarter Innova-
tion: Center for People Led-Digitalization” is a collaboration
between Nottingham, Bath, and Loughborough universities to
overcome the digital skills gap, lack of senior management,
employee resistance, and support for human capability in
Industry 5.0. The project aims to achieve a sustainable digital

technology adoption while keeping an emphasis on the well-
being of a worker at the center of production process5.

3) AI REGIO: In Europe, digital innovation hubs (DIHs)
are being created to support small medium enterprises (SMEs)
for their smooth transition to Industry 5.0. The project ”AI
REGIO” was funded by EU to address business, technology,
and policy barriers in making AI-focused DIHs a reality.
In this regard, the project ”Regions and DIH alliance for
AI-driven digital transformation of European Manufacturing
SMEs” was funded (October 2020 - September 2023) by
Horizon 2020 (H2020) with the co-ordination of Politecnico
Di Milano, Italy. This project aims to address three major
concerns that kind of create hurdles in implementing digital
pathways between AI-driven DIHs and Manufacturing SMEs,
i.e. European Union vs Regional Gap (policy driven concern),
Innovation collaboration platform vs Digital Manufacturing
Gap (Technology driven concern), and Industry 4.0 vs Industry
5.0 gap (Business driven concern)6.

the
The gap between EU and regional SMEs is about
scale at which AI innovations are applied and integrated.
Furthermore, this gap also addresses the issue of accessibility
to global marketplaces. A policy needs to be devised to
provide equal opportunities to the SMEs in order to scale up
the innovation as well as competition. Currently, the DIHs
and digital manufacturing platforms (DMPs) fuel the digital
European industry and digital single market concerning SMEs.
So far, the related innovation, communities, and initiatives are
working in an independent way, therefore, platform-related
challenges and technology adoption measures need to be
incorporated not only to increase the Socio-Business impact
but also to bridge the gap between DIH and DMP. The business
driven gap mainly concerns ICT innovation for manufacturing
SMEs (I4MS) phase III platforms that pilot Industry 4.0
implementations through IoT, Motion and Analytics Data. It
has been suggested in this project that I4MS does not properly
addresses the synergy between AI revolution (autonomous
systems) and Industry 5.0 (human-centricity) that creates the
gap between Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. This projects aims
to solve the aforementioned three concerns, accordingly.

4) Collaborative Consortium on Industry 5.0: A kind of
collaborative consortium has recently been developed among

the EU universities to collectively work on Industry 5.0,
speciﬁcally with the focus on combining human craftsmanship
and creativity with productivity, speed, and consistency of
Robots7. The consortium includes Henry Royce Insitute, The
Thomas Ashton Institute, The Tyndall Centre, The Manch-
ester Institute of Data Science and Artiﬁcial Intelligence,
The Global Development Institute, The Manchester Urban
Institute, and The Productivity Institute. The main idea of this
consortium is to integrate human strength and AI for enabling
mass personalization, improving products and productivity,
deep understanding of customers, value-added creativity, and
problem solving. Some of the other projects that are indirectly
related to Industry 5.0 are mentioned in the Table. VI.

IX. LESSONS LEARNED, RESEARCH CHALLENGES AND
FUTURE DIRECTIONS

With respect

to the practical utilization of Industry 5.0
vision and the emerging CI-NGWNs, we discuss various
important observations, recommendations, and open future
research challenges/problems in this section.

A. Industry 5.0 Technological Enablers and CI-NGWNs

In this subsection, we outlines the lessons learned, research
challenges and research directions after in detail review of the
Sec. I and III.

In conclusion,

1) Lessons Learned:

the key practical
lessons and recommendations derived from the systematic
review can be summarized as follows:
1. Industry 5.0 Vision: The concrete and universally-adopted
the next revolution
deﬁnition of the Industry 5.0 vision,
to the Industry 4.0 paradigm,
to be deﬁned as it
is yet
is continuously evolving. It
is observed from the various
deﬁnitions of researchers and authors that Industry 5.0 vision
will be based on human and robots co-working (c.f. II). EU
commission documents have reportedly deﬁned the Industry
5.0 vision based on human-centric sustainable and resilient
goals. More speciﬁcally,
the vision comprises the critical
technological enablers and digital systems that work in unison
towards integrating the people-centric and people-empowered
ecosystem with the goals of mass personalization and mass
customization-based scalable manufacturing and productions.

7https://www.digitalfutures.manchester.ac.uk/themes/societal-

challenges/industry-5-0/

This can bring high and multifold positive impacts on various
critical dimensions of the human ecosystem, e.g., digital
society, government and political scenarios, economic and
environmental perspectives.
2. CI-NGWNs: The nexus of computational intelligence as
an enabling technology with NGWNs (6G) forms a CI-
NGWNs, potentially a powerful integrated solution, which has
seen a great deal of interest from academia and researchers
(c.f. Sec. I). Based on the systematic review, it is observed
that CI-NGWNs can enable the wide range of scenarios in
the Industry 5.0 vision by providing various critical network
features, e.g., 1) inherent capabilities of CI technology (i.e.,
swarm AI, evolutionary AI, DRL algorithms, fuzzy systems,
and others) to provide diverse, intelligent functions throughout
the core network, 2) softwarized service provisioning and
orchestration, 3) AI-native service architecture for ensuring
diverse QoS and QoE requirements, 4) zero-touch network
management and operations, 5) private intelligent networks,
and 6) O-RAN architecture support.
3. Technological Enablers: The technological enablers in
Industry 5.0 vision bridge the physical and cyber world to
allow seamless integration between human intelligence and
cobots working in unison (c.f. Fig. 3). In this regard, six
technological enablers and systems have been categorized and
explored in Sec. III-A to identify the critical roles and re-
quirements they incur. These categorizations are, 1) technolo-
gies that enable human-machine interactions in manufacturing
and productions, e.g., CCPSS systems, AMR, augmented
reality technologies for visualization insights, and cognitive
services, 2) technologies and processes that enable virtual
simulation and digital twins implementation, e.g., IIoT-based
CPS systems, industrial process optimization, holograms, and
digital 3D modeling, 3) AI-native smart systems to intro-
duces secure, safe, energy-efﬁcient and person-centric AI, 4)
data infrastructure, sharing and analytics features to provide
edge computing and micro clouds, communication interfaces,
scalable and autonomy over multi-level IT infrastructure,
and big data analytics-based management, 5) bio-inspired
technologies, e.g., embedded bio-sensor networks, body area
networks, and 6) energy-efﬁciency paradigms, e.g., integration
of renewable energy sources and energy-autonomous systems-
based on energy harvesting mechanism.
4. Network-in-Box Architecture: The adoption of NIB ar-
chitecture in CI-NGWNs enables the interoperable paradigm
of intelligent network softwarization in tandem with AI-native
SBA that is embedded throughout the entire network, provid-
ing reconﬁgurable integrated solutions and network resources
for meeting the critical technical requirements of Industry 5.0
vision. In this regard, design objectives for the CI-NGWNs
concerning Industry 5.0 vision are identiﬁed and discussed in
Sec. III-B, which is followed by the NIBs architecture vision
in CII-NGWNs that brings the numerous enabling functional
features and softwarized service support using SDN/NFV-
enabled networked HCIs. These enhanced CI-native features
(c.f .Fig. 4) are distributed throughout all CI-NGWNs func-
tional
intelligent
network control layer, analytic layer, and sensing layer. It is
observed and learned that NIBs architecture together with CI

intelligent application layer,

layers, e.g.,

31

technology in NGWNs could efﬁciently cater to the critical
incurred requirements of technological enablers in Industry
5.0 vision, identiﬁed and categorized in Sec. III-A.

2) Research Challenges and Future Directions: This dis-
cussion outlines the various foreseeable open problems that
can be summarized as follows in light of the preceding analysis
on lessons learned and recommendations:
1. Challenges in Industry 5.0 Vision: The work on Industry
5.0 vision has recently started, and it has got much attention
from researchers. However, particular challenges still exist on
full human-robots collaboration realization and identiﬁcation
of other critical aspects of human-society impact on the
vision since they are hard to quantify and measure [20],
such as 1) social challenges, e.g., digitally skilled labor
shortages, unemployments, corporate social responsibilities,
customer value, and socio-centricity in technical training to
learn complex ecosystem of technologies, 2) government and
political challenges, e.g., compliances with country-speciﬁc
laws, adaptation with the speed of technological changes,
protectionism, and digital system-oriented innovation policies,
3) economic challenges, e.g., new business models, circular
economy, productivity challenges, signiﬁcant investments, and
public-private partnerships, and 4) interdisciplinary approach
towards nexus of various research disciplines to address inter-
relations and cause-effects relations in system complexities,
e.g., engineering and technology, mathematics, computer sci-
ences, life and humanities, environmental and social sciences.
2. CI-NGWNs Challenges: Some of the critical challenges
in CI-NGWNs lie in the ultimate mobile experience, ex-
treme global network coverage, and mission-critical
low-
latency communications compared to the 5G networks [1].
For extreme global network coverage, UAV-Satellite-based
terrestrial networks have taken a great deal of promising re-
search direction in providing communication and computation
services where reliable coverage is not possible due to lack
of infrastructure and environmental factors [70]. Additionally,
for URLLC-centric problems, ranging and positioning over the
deployed NGWNs infrastructure at mmWave bands has gained
importance since they require the nanosecond-level accuracy
layer in ultra-dense wireless networks for
at
timing synchronization procedures [226]. Similarly, to provide
enhanced computing and storage service,
there is a need
to be smooth integration between cloud/edge networks and
wireless access networks with critical enabling technologies,
e.g., mmWave-THz bands, mMIMO technologies, advanced
antenna arrays, NOMA and RIS metasurfaces. Furthermore,
with the requirements of human intelligence integration, new
developing performance metrics, such as Quality-of-Physical-
Experience (QoPE), are needed since they can combine the
required QoS and QoE with the human-centric perception and
intelligence in new vertical applications [234], e.g., AR-VR-
XR in augmented reality technologies, holographic communi-
cation.
3. Challenges in Technological Enablers: The core idea
behind technological enablers for Industry 5.0 vision is to
introduce and integrate the lost human-centric dimension (i.e.,
human values and needs) of the previous revolution [233]. In
this regard, numerous complex systems and technologies are

the physical

categorized and discussed in this reviewed work. However,
technologies and systems assisting the human-machine collab-
oration to generate products and services, e.g., human-machine
interfaces, integrating human-intelligence using person-centric
AI, AMRs, cognitive CPSS systems, and others, are still
in early development stages and possess critical research
challenges before they are matured enough [49]. Similarly,
the requirements and challenges differs with the type of
Industry 5.0 scenario. For example, to ensure trust in the
cloud/edge-based matrix production system, the critical private
data exchange between humans (designer, collaborators) and
machines at the factory physical ﬂoor for monitoring and
control needs to be secured and not visible to any third-party
system for potential cyber-attacks. Therefore, a blockchain and
digital ledger transaction (DLT) in conjunction with federated
learning-enabled quantum computing can provide a robust
framework for Industry 5.0 [54], enabling faster cognitive
edge data processing for stringent time applications and data
preserving secure transaction.
Simultaneously, the ethical and societal issues with imple-
menting AI needs to be addressed for seamless collaboration
between the human resources and cobots since it can create
negative societal impacts due to the notion of job displace-
ments and humans replacements with AI-based cobots sys-
tems, while Industry 5.0 is poised to create more employment
opportunities [231]. Moreover, data privacy in cobots needs to
be preserved while doing the cognitive analysis in predictive
maintenance applications with humans collaboration. One of
the essential requirements is regulatory compliance in the
co-production environment, where several issues relevant to
technical policies and proper regulations may arise [23], e.g.,
1) distinguishing between cognitive cobots and several other
machines, i.e., drones, AMRs and 2) the inculcation use of
critical AI in nexus with other complex digital systems, and
3) better predictions and control over more sophisticated mass-
personalization goals.
4. NIB Architecture Challenges: Based on the critical
systematic review and potential uses of NIB architecture in
CI-NGWNs for supporting Industry 5.0 vision, we observed
and categorized the relevant goal-based critical challenges
into four groups, 1) hyper-intelligent network challenges, i.e.,
integrating CI into the core network, 2) coordinated and
harmonized network challenges, i.e., co-existence of hyper-
intelligent core network with other standalone networks and
backward compatibility, e.g., 5G, terrestrial and non-terrestrial
networks, visible light communication, 3) sustainable network
challenges, i.e., green computing-enabled energy-efﬁcient net-
works, and 4) cyber security challenges.
in-
Some of
cludes [10], 1) lack of standard and high-quality network
datasets that has distinguished features, e.g., channel model-
ing, RAN technologies, device densities, 2) visibility of the
underlying network operations since almost all proposed AI
solutions are implemented in black-box manner, and 3) hybrid
public-private network challenges in providing centralized and
distributed AI-based solutions at the network edge. Similarly,
the coordinated networks challenges and future directions
includes [12], 1) holistic approach towards designing frame-

the hyper-intelligent network challenges

32

works that initiates the convergence between cyber, physical,
biological, and social space through wirelessly connected
biosensors and CCPSS systems using nano-networks, cell-
free MIMO, autonomous D2D, above 100 GHz THz and
optical spectrum, 2) global-level optimization scheme in cood-
inated networks to utilize the available communication and
computation resources at different networks efﬁciently and
collaboratively, and 3) trustworthy cooperation and protocols
between the coordinated networks for seamless allocation and
operation of AI-native functions.
Similarly, potential challenges in sustainable network goals in-
clude [13], 1) energy-aware routing and resource management
algorithms for ultra-dense wireless sensors network, 2) global-
level network sustainability through integrating renewable
energy systems and varying level of processing power in com-
puting infrastructure, and 3) adaptive data modulation schemes
for enabling data compression. Meanwhile, the cyber security
challenges in the wake of AI inclusion include the design
of new novel AI-based security architecture to provide basic
security and privacy requirements in future networks [92],
e.g., conﬁdentiality, location privacy, integrity, identity privacy,
availability and authenticity, data privacy and other meta-data
privacy.

B. Computational Intelligence for Industry 5.0

In this subsection, we outlines the lessons learned and
recommendations, research challenges and research directions
after in detail review of the Sec. VI.

1) Lessons Learned: Based on the systematic review pre-
sented in the previous sections, the key practical lessons and
recommendations are as follows.
1. Diverse use of Computational Intelligence: With such
diversiﬁed characteristics of computational intelligence tech-
niques, issues concerning resiliency, sustainability, and per-
sonalization are ought to be handled in Industry 5.0. For
instance, variants of some supervised learning and federated
learning can be widely used for resilient systems in Industry
5.0. Similarly, methods that are less computationally complex,
such as self-supervised learning or soft computing techniques,
can be used to achieve sustainability, and many intelligence
techniques can be employed for achieving mass personaliza-
tion as well.
2. CI for Industrial Security: The critical success of Industry
5.0 depends on the usage of CFE devices and computational
intelligence. However, these devices are quite vulnerable to
security and privacy attacks. Studies presented in the previous
section are now moving toward implementation or adoption
of computational intelligence techniques that not only provide
smart services, but also preserve privacy and security of users’
data speciﬁcally in Industry 5.0 setting. In this regard, the
use of Federated learning and soft computing techniques have
proven to be quite effective so far. As humans have a high
stake in Industry 5.0, it is important to deal with such security
and privacy threats in an efﬁcient and effective manner.
3. CI for Emerging Applications: Since the advent of Indus-
try 5.0, the use cases were mostly limited to manufacturing,
supply chain, and human-robot collaboration. In recent years

and with the popularity of the ﬁfth industrial revolution, more
applications are emerging and the use-cases are increasing. For
instance, researchers have proposed the use of Industry 5.0 in
industrial automation, data privacy and security, Society 5.0,
and alternative energy sources. Researchers have also started
to explore the use cases of Industry 5.0 in the domain of
healthcare, emotional intelligence, and education. It is assumed
that the increase in digital assets and technologies will pave the
way for more applications that can be associated with Industry
5.0 to improve value creation and circular economy.

2) Research Challenges and Future Directions: This sec-
tion highlights the foreseeable open research problems con-
cerning computational intelligence in Industry 5.0.
1. Exploring CI with Technological Frontiers: The use of
computational intelligence has been exploited for a variety
of industrial and manufacturing use cases, but only a lim-
ited amount of attention has been diverted toward education,
healthcare, and next generation network domains. Each of the
aforementioned domain has its own corresponding challenges,
for instance, personalization and resilience is the key to
academic industry, acquisition of sensor data and its privacy
are essential for health care data, and affordability is one of the
keystones for Industry 5.0’s integration with next generation
networks [44], [235]. Researchers must push the envelope to
explore or extend the research in the aforementioned areas.
2. Mental wellbeing and Affective Computing with CI:
Industry 5.0 is said to be an association with human workers
while making the production process automated and user-
friendly. However, existing studies have shown that working
with machines causes emotional imbalance and stress [236],
[237]. Considering that the ﬁfth industrial revolution has a
dedicated work-plan with machines, the monitoring of mental
well-being and stress levels is an issues that needs to be
undertaken. Computational intelligence techniques can play a
vital role in monitoring and diagnosing stress or depressing
state in a timely manner so that a necessary action can be
executed for avoiding health issues. Currently, to the best of
our knowledge, this issue has not been explored in the context
of Industry 5.0.
3. Seamless Integration of CI with Digital Spaces: With the
current rise in digital technologies such as virtual medicine,
digital twins, and Metaverse, the concept of Industry 5.0 can be
leveraged to make manufacturing and industrial spaces more
sustainable, resilient, and human-centric 8. However, in order
to provide seamless integration, computational
intelligence
is of vital importance. For instance, digital avatars can be
designed and simulated via digital twin to see how productive
and sustainable the designed industry would be with certain
characteristics. This will allow investors to not only foresee
and plan budget
issues, but also to identify the potential
opportunities that could be exploited to generate more revenue

C. Open and Intelligent 6G Network Architectures

Here, we outline the lessons learned, research challenges,

and future directions based on Sec. V.

1) Lessons Learned: The following key lessons and rec-

ommendations are derived from the systematic review.
1. SON and O-RAN Integration: From Sec. V-A, it is learned
that by merging self-organizing networks (SON) and O-RAN
architectures, several advantages are gained, including the use
of the same infrastructure nodes and monitoring databases,
as well as cross-operations. In particular, the use of Man-
agement Data Analytic Service (MDAS) with Non-RT RIC
is highly synergistic. Additionally, the O-RAN orchestrator
provides services for SON. O-RAN communities are already
implementing integration, which needs to be enforced in the
long run.
2. MEC, Network Slicing, and O-RAN Integration: The
support of MEC and Network Slicing (NS) in the O-RAN ar-
chitecture will bring multi-fold features to enhance the perfor-
mance of CI-NGWNs, e.g., 1) MEC hosts (third party vendors)
can be integrated with the near-RT RIC hosts of O-RAN, 2)
O-RAN databases can integrate with MEC databases that can
possibly include the critical information, e.g., UE locations,
deployed cell performance, radio network information service
(RNIS) and others, 3) mobile edge application orchestrator
(MEAO) can be used for diverse type of xApps orchestration.
e.g., SON functions, softwarized enterprise services, and 4)
with NS support, an XApps slice can be include in the NR slice
templates., which can be easily orchestrated by the O-RAN
and/or MEC orchestrator on the separate and secure partition
of O-RAN and/or MEC databases.

2) Research Challenges and Future Directions: This sec-
tion reﬂects upon the imminent challenges in 6G architecture
design and optimization,
inclusive of network intelligence
(NI). In particular:
1. O-RAN Optimization: Many challenges for implementing
O-RAN-based data-driven, open, programmable, and virtual-
ized NextG architecture are still largely to be dealt with, where
the main concerns are [154]: functionalities and parameters of
each network functions, distribution of network intelligence,
optimization of data-driven control loop solutions, and RAN
data access overhead for NI.
2. E2E NI-native Architecture with Customized AI: The
NextG architecture will require to host/integrate NI instances
explicitly at NF levels and their coordination across entire
network (i.e., macro-domains). Meanwhile, AI models should
facilitate network automation and management, and thereby
adapted (w.r.t. latency guarantees training and computational
complexity) for NI-speciﬁc design aspects. Besides, the other
two main challenges are [160]: AI feedback loop between the
control and data planes not allowing the NI to monitor the
system in a continuous manner, and the lack of interaction
among NI instances at different levels in the current architec-
tural trends.

D. Softwarized Service Provisioning and Potential Applica-
tions

In this subsection, we outlines the lessons learned, research
challenges and research directions after in detail review of the

Sec. IV and VII.

1) Lessons Learned: From the systematic review, we derive

the following key lessons and recommendations:
1. Multi-tenant Softwarized Service Provisioning: Based
on aformentioned discussion in Sec. IV, it is learned that the
essential features of Industry 5.0 will be realized through soft-
warized components embedded throughout the hardware and
cyber world in digital systems. For example, to achieve zero-
defect manufacturing and mass-customization goals in matrix
productions, softwarized components, like ACF functions, DT
functions, and others, thus enabling fully self-automated con-
trol in production manufacturing and assembly. In this regard,
a multi-tenant softwarized service provisioning framework
based on CI-NGWNs is illustrated in Fig. 5, aiming to provide
the essential and on-demand softwarized services orchestration
of required critical functions over many functional
layers
for on-demand applications in the Industry 5.0 vision. These
functional layers are, 1) service layer providing multi-tenancy
support and service mesh-enabled composite service blocks
to orchestrate customized services for deployed multi-tenant
industrial apps, 2) computational intelligence layer providing
critical functions of AFL and DTFL, and 3) infrastructure
layer providing functions of HCI resources, industrial access
networks, autonomy and control over computing infrastruc-
ture and DTI functions. Together, all of these layers work
in conjunction to enable the best practices and principles
of SOA, microservices, and serverless architecture principles
(c.f. Fig. 6 and Table IV) in a CI-enabled softwarized industrial
framework to support a wide range of critical softwarized
services, e.g., XaaS, AIaaS, DTaaS, NFaaS, and others, that
were covered and discussed in Sec. VII.
2. Softwarized Communication and Industrial DevOps: In
Sec. VII, it is learned that the multi-tenant service provision
architecture can orchestrate and deploy the softwarized XaaS
paradigm over NIBs architecture in CI-NGWNs. For example,
Fig. 13 illustrates a hybrid NIBs architecture, i.e., aggregated
CI-NGWNs and on-premise backhaul HCI industrial network,
to provide enhanced services for critical applications, e.g.,
1) intelligent control planes using CaaS, IaaS, AIaaS, SlaaS
and NFVaaS for zero-touch networks, 2) customized DTaaS
to enable and connect the machine/cell physical twins and
virtual twins over the various placement of choices such as
cloud, edge, and private databases, 3) hybrid cloud architec-
tures to connect public and private cloud, 4) enabling time-
sensitive networking to meet stringent time synchronization
requirements for cobots operations in cells, and 5) NTaaS
to provide critical localization and ranging services at physi-
cal manufacturing ﬂoors. Similarly, bi-directional softwarized
communication (i.e., virtual links) is enabled over physical bi-
directional links of hybrid NIBs architecture to provide real-
time reliable and control communication between physical
twins and DT placed at entire CI-NGWNs. Moreover, the
integration of XaaS principles provides the infrastructure for
enabling enhanced DevOps strategies designed to meet enter-
prise requirements. In this regard, it is learned from Table IV
that various softwarized architecture provides various features
and signiﬁcance to adopt the suitable architecture for required
DevOps and enabling strategies in cloud-native environments,

34

which incurs the speciﬁc drawbacks/limitations according to
the selected frameworks.
3. Industrial DT and Metaverse: From Sec. VII-E1, we
learned that DTaaS is poised to form a building block for
realizing the different Industry 5.0 applications, e.g., predictive
maintenance industries, zero-manufacturing, and others. It
bridges and connects the created virtual image of industrial as-
sets with counterpart physical space, thus efﬁciently increasing
the hyperconnectivity to integrate human intelligence through
augmented reality technologies. Moreover, CI-NGWNs archi-
tecture can also take services of DT implementation at the core
network for creating the DT of the network to assist in the
dynamic reconﬁguration of communication and computation
resource allocations. The autonomous DT creation using DL
methods for any required applications can be realized through
DTaaS implementation infrastructure, as illustrated in Fig. 16.
Note that the mesh-connection and more superconvergence of
created DT virtual images in cyberspace can lead to the new
futuristic technology of tomorrow— metaverse. In Sec. VII-E,
it is learned that the metaverse promotes the digitization of
every physical reality comprised of humans, industrial assets
and devices, vehicles (i.e., AMRs, AGVs), buildings (i.e.,
manufacturing ﬂoor, cells), and others to form a web of
uniﬁed and ubiquitously connected virtual worlds. In this
regard, three process steps from initial DT implementation to
ﬁnal metaverse realization have been explained. Moreover, the
required metaverse enabling technology and resultant features
of the metaverse-ecosystem has been illustrated in Fig. 17,
which indicates that DT enabling features in Industry 5.0
vision will evolve and transition towards the metaverse-based
digitized industrial concepts to successfully realize the true
fusion between physical and virtual space and goals of human-
machine interaction.
4. Localization Services: The requirement of centimeter-
level accuracy in localization and ranging techniques has
increased the importance of NTaaS services in mission-critical
and location-aware Industry 5.0 applications like AMRS,
AGVs, product and human tracking, and others. In this regard,
it is learned from Sec. VII-F that various light-based and
wireless-based enabling technologies exist for localization
purposes, e.g., LIDAR, GPS, WiFi, RFID, ZigBee, LoRaWAN,
UWB, and mmWave/THz. These technologies provide differ-
ent performance metric-based solutions, e.g., cost, scalability,
accuracy-precision, and implementation complexity. Similarly,
various enabling technologies are reported in the literature
to use different available localization techniques, e.g., ToA,
RSSI, AOA/AoD, cooperative localization, and hybrid algo-
rithms (i.e., RSSI-ToA-based frameworks). In, Fig. 18, the
classiﬁcation of various enabling technologies and techniques
based on their range-resolution performance in the diverse
scenario has been illustrated, which shows that mmWave-
THz-based localization is ideal and perfect to use since they
can provide ICAR services by using the existing CI-NGWNs
infrastructure.

2) Research Challenges and Future Directions: In light of
lessons learned and recommendations in the preceding section,
the following are some of the foreseeable open problems:
1. Multi-tenant Softwarized Service Provisioning Chal-

lenges: It is imperative that uniﬁed service management in
multi-tenant cloud/edge-native NIBs environments demand
novel mechanisms and performance guarantees (e.g., agility
and ﬂexibility) for designing, instantiating, deploying, run-
ning, and optimizing composite services within softwarized
HCI [10], [185]. In this regard, the possible research direc-
tions are, 1) heterogeneous functions, e.g., network, compute,
and storage resources must be integrated in single infras-
tructure layer and managed holistically, even though they
are in different tech-domains, 2) function design and system
scalability, e.g., the increase in the number of ﬁner-grained
service components (functions) and the communication over-
heads among them in microservices architecture make system
scalability more challenging, 3) modelling uniﬁed abstraction
for resources and services, i.e., to overcome the heterogeneity
challenge in convergence of enabling technologies in NIBs of
CI-NGWNs, it is critical to design and regularize a standard
set of models for uniﬁed abstractions of resources and services
across these domains, and 4) new technologies for customized
service management, e.g., KubeEdge, Kubernetes, OpenShift,
etc., can be used as automating software management, scaling,
and deployment utilizing an open-source container orchestra-
tion system [85].
2. Challenges in Softwarized Communication and Indus-
trial DevOps: The complexity in NIBs architecture of CI-
NGWNs is expected to unprecedently grow with the wide
range of softwarized heterogeneous service requirements by
highly diverse Industry 5.0 applications, e.g., cloud/edge func-
tions often require lower latency, higher throughput, and
greater reliability than the VNFs do [128], [184]. Moreover,
the resource limitations, inefﬁcient deployed service applica-
tion execution, communication protocols for data sharing, con-
trol signaling and resource allocations between heterogenous
coordinated networks, and service mobility and connectivity
form the performance bottleneck in heterogeneous cloud/edge-
native environment [183]. Thus, developing comprehensive
solutions to deal with heterogeneity, scalability, ﬂexibility, and
performance in softwarized NIBs architecture of CI-NGWNs
networks becomes an important research area. Moreover, ac-
quired third-party service types dictate the DevOps strategies
for enterprise softwarized solutions. For example, in third-
party AIaaS solutions, the enterprise management and service
development teams have no access to the underlying actual
AI process since they only have the option of dealing with
the inputs and outputs of the system, which changes the
design guidelines of enabling software-oriented service archi-
tecture principles, affecting privacy and increasing security
risks [134].
3. Industrial DT and Metaverse Challenges: Industrial DT
and augmented reality technologies provide a smooth human-
robotic experience in terms of visualization and interaction
with the machine processes for monitoring, control, and op-
timization [1]. However, its performance can suffer from the
typical KPIs of CI-NGWNs, e.g., network latency, bandwidth,
throughput, and jitter, as they are critical and required features
for a smooth user experience [214]. Moreover, the mobility
with multi-sensor fusion applications (e.g., AMRs, AGVs)
can further complicate the critical machine tasks in remote

35

operations through industrial DT [77]. Hence, for smooth DT
operation, it is necessary to address industrial DT’s stringent
communication and computation requirements, eventually, the
industrial metaverse-based applications, as they require a two-
way reliable communication link over CI-NGWNs. Addition-
ally, with more vendors, third parties, and service providers
included in CI-NGWNs to offer MECs services, there is a
high-security risk of multiple adversaries accessing, stealing,
and tampering with the sensitive information and data from
implemented edge DTs [215]. Moreover, in the context of
AI signiﬁcance in Industrial DT and metaverse-based applica-
tions, there is a need to design privacy- and security-preserving
AI models that can automate security and privacy preferences
while creating virtual copies of physical assets and protect
them from adversarial attacks [8].
4. Localization Services Challenges: Following are the possi-
ble future challenges and trends in indoor positioning systems
that can aid the NTaaS paradignm.
1) Indoor positioning and ranging coverage in mmWave and
THz bands suffers from harsh multipath conditions due
to severe NLOS blockages, e.g., human blockages, ma-
chine blockages, and scattering conditions, e.g., metallic
surfaces, energy absorption. Moreover, the performance
of ToA-based in terms of ranging and positioning accu-
racy degrades with indoor factory (InF) conditions [228].
In this regard, RIS metasurfaces together with mMIMO
technology operating at mmWave-THz bands can be used
to provide enhanced ICAR services by [226], 1) aiding
localization algorithms through intelligent reconﬁguration
of InF environments, 2) extending the ranging coverage by
covering the NLOS blockages areas, and 2) reconﬁgured
mMIMO channel gain matrix to increase sparsity for
provision of the high capacity-based wireless connectivity.
Similarly, the inclusion of smart beamforming at mmWave-
bands can signiﬁcantly increase the RSSI-based localiza-
tion algorithms.

2) New hybrid localization algorithms are needed for the
ultra-dense wireless sensor with the inherent features of
low complexity, high precision, and high accuracy. In
this regard, fusion-based localization algorithms can be
explored that infer the estimated location using the fusion
of location information obtained from multiple wireless
technologies (WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRaWAN, and others)
employing different wireless localization techniques (ToA,
RSSI, ﬁngerprinting, and others) [217], [238]. One promis-
ing direction in fusion-based localization is multi-sensor
fusion-based algorithms are promising for AGVs and AMR
applications since they combine the wireless technologies
with other technologies, e.g., optical (LIDAR), inertial, or
ultrasonic [239].

X. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we reviewed the Industry 5.0 vision and
the vision requirements for innovative uses in Industry 5.0
while primarily focusing on the role of connecting CI with
the NIBs architecture of NGWNs, i.e., CI-native NGWNs,
as a technological enabler to satisfy essential requirements

of Industry 5.0 vision. In this regard, we ﬁrst discussed the
detailed overview of the Industry 5.0 vision in terms of
three enabling goals, i.e., human-centric, sustainability, and
resilience, and established the required technological enablers
and critical requirements it
incurs for the full realization
of Industry 5.0. Second, we discussed the design objectives
and vision of CI-NGWNs and the NIBs architecture as an
enabler in CI-NGWNs design to fulﬁll the critical demands of
identiﬁed Industry 5.0 technological requirements. Afterward,
we identiﬁed and discussed the emerging critical features and
technologies of CI-NGWNs, including the computational in-
telligence algorithms, tools, and frameworks, multi-tenant soft-
warized service provisioning framework for self-organizing
industrial automation networks, virtualized O-RAN architec-
ture, private mobile networks, and hybrid TSN-enabled NIBs
architecture and potential enabling services, for Industry 5.0.
In addition, we discussed the various technologies and services
of NIBs architecture that CI-NGWNs could exploit to realize
Industry 5.0. In the end, we reviewed our research ﬁndings and
provided insights, recommendations, and future directions for
research on Industry 5.0 and how CI and NGWNs shape it. In
particular, the main challenges stem from the fulﬁllment of in-
creasing human-machine interactions to provide human-centric
solutions in Industry 5.0, where the support of scalable and
ﬂexible CI technology at the softwarized NIBs architecture of
NGWNs is needed for hybrid and uniﬁed service deployments.
Meanwhile, CI-NGWNs are expected to address the identiﬁed
research challenges relevant to the O-RAN orchestration and
deployments, ultimate user and machine experiences, hyper-
intelligent network, coordinated and harmonized network, sus-
tainable network, and cyber security.
