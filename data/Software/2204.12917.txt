Abstract 
Early adolescence is a time of major social change; a strong sense of belonging and peer connectedness is 
an  essential  protective  factor  in  mental  health  during  that  period.  In  this paper  we  introduce  LINA,  an 
augmented  reality (AR) smartphone-based serious game  played in school  by  an entire  class (age  10+) 
together with their teacher, which aims to facilitate and improve peer interaction, sense of belonging and 
class climate, while creating a safe space to reflect on mental health and external stressors related to family 
circumstance.  LINA  was  developed  through  an  interdisciplinary  collaboration  involving  a  playwright, 
software developers, psychologists, and artists, via an iterative co-development process with young people. 
A prototype has been evaluated quantitatively for usability and qualitatively for efficacy in a study with 91 
early adolescents (agemean=11.41). Results from the Game User Experience Satisfaction Scale (GUESS-18) 
and data from qualitative focus groups showed high acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the game.  
Using AR, a shared immersive narrative and collaborative gameplay in a shared physical space offers an 
opportunity  to  harness  adolescent  affinity  for  digital  technology  towards  improving  real-world  social 
connection and sense of belonging. 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1  INTRODUCTION 

2 

Positive peer relationships and supportive  friendships  become  increasingly  important  from early 
adolescence [1]. A sense of belonging – defined as “a pervasive drive to form and maintain at least 
a  minimum  quantity  of  lasting,  positive,  and  significant  interpersonal  relationships”  [2, 
p. 497] – plays a pivotal role in mental health. Belonging – and school belonging in particular – 
is  an  important  protective  factor  during  the  defining  years  of  school,  particularly  in  early 
adolescence [3]. There are for example consistent positive relations between  a  sense  of belonging 
and  academic  performance,  self-concept,  behavioural  engagement,  and  a  general  sense  of 
wellbeing  [4-7].  In  contrast,  victimisation  and  peer-related  stress  (e.g.,  physical  aggression, 
humiliation, exclusion) hinder sense of belonging [8, 9], which often creates peer rejection, resulting 
in  long-term  mental  health  problems  [10].  Positive  interactions  both  in  real-  life  and  online 
environments can reduce barriers between peers and improve sense of belonging [9].  Likewise, 
stigma  can  be  reduced  by  spending  time  with  ‘outsiders’  in  a  safe  environment, 
e.g. undertaking structured, shared and collaborative experiences [11, 12]. 

In most countries, early adolescence is also the time of transition from primary to secondary 
school (e.g. at age 10 in Austria, age 11 in the UK), which involves major challenges such as a new 
and larger school environment, more responsibility and academic pressure and often the necessity 
to make new friends (when old friends have gone to a different school and because of a substantial 
influx of new people), which creates a new social dynamic. This transition can be difficult for some 
early adolescents and lead to a decrease in social and emotional health [13]. Positive peer relations 
and stable friendships are an important protective factor for successful school transition, while poor 
peer relations and low-quality friendships serve  as  a risk  factor [14], making early adolescence an 
especially  relevant  but  also  fragile  time  for  sense  of  belonging,  and  a  crucial  window  for 
interventions. 

As most adolescent social connections are formed in the school setting  [15], classes are an ideal 
target for interventions promoting sense of belonging and positive  peer  relations. Traditional social 
skill  trainings  (SST)  and  social  and  emotional  learning  (SEL)  have  been  shown  to  effectively 
improve  adolescents’  social-emotional  skills  and  wellbeing  [16].  However,  adolescent  lives  are 
increasingly intertwined with the digital world; friendships are formed and maintained online from 
early adolescence [17]. Furthermore,  most adolescents  regularly  play and  enjoy  digital  games 
[81% aged  10-24  report  playing games;  18].  Digital  technology  thus offers opportunities for new 
ways to implement interventions around SEL and belonging, redeploying adolescent affinity for 
technology towards supporting real-world peer relations and group dynamics. 

Advances in information technology  have led to many new approaches to engaging people with 
educational content in settings that are novel and attractive  to  young  people,  and potentially offer 
pedagogical advantages. Combining the “fun” of games with the “serious” content of education [19] 
and using well-established motivational components of gamification (such as clear goals and guided 
paths,  or  direct  feedback  and  rewards)  [20]  makes  gamified  interventions  and  serious  games 
especially  engaging  for  users  and  an  attractive  prospect 
for both  educationalists  and 
psychologists. A specific direction in serious gaming is the use of augmented reality (AR). AR is a 
technology where virtual components are overlaid onto the real world, so that the player engages 
with  the  illusion  that  this  virtual  component  exists  in  the physical  world.  Made  famous  by  the 
popular  commercial  game  Pokémon  Go  by  Niantic  in  2016, it  has  now  found  its  way  into 
educational settings [for literature reviews see  21,  22,  23]. Although rigorous evaluations remain 
rare,  recent  literature  reviews  suggest  involvement,  engagement,  motivational,  and  (tentatively) 
pedagogical effects of using  AR  games  for education [21, 24]. There remain many opportunities 
to improve  the  impact of  serious  games. For  example,  the  majority  of  serious  games  are  not 
designed by a multidisciplinary team [25]. 

Our  aim  was  to  design  and  co-develop  a  mobile  AR  serious  game  (LINA)  to  address  real- 
world social  connection and sense of belonging in the  classroom with and for early adolescents 
(aged 10+). LINA is  a shared, immersive, interactive narrative in which players  collaborate as they 
use augmented reality to uncover artefacts left behind by a fictional classmate, in order to determine, 

 
 
 
  
 
 
3 

collectively,  where  she  has  gone  and  why.  The  game  pursues  two  outcomes.  First,  it  aims  to 
strengthen  sense  of  belonging  by  bringing  together  classmates  to  share  both  immersive  and 
collaborative  gameplay  in  a  structured  way,  creating  positive  experiences  around  successfully 
solving puzzles in pairs or groups. Second, it aims to create a safe space for a class and their teacher 
to  learn  about  and  reflect  on  prejudice,  stigma,  and  social  wellbeing,  especially  around  mental 
health. This leads to reduced stigmatisation and marginalisation of peers who present or behave 
differently. 

In  this  paper,  we  describe  the  concept  of  LINA,  including  theoretical  background,  storyline 
and  gameplay,  and  design  and  (co-)development  processes,  and  present  results  from  an  initial 
evaluation study, where we quantitatively evaluated usability  and  qualitatively  evaluated efficacy 
of the game. 

2  RELATED WORK 

Gamified  interventions  and  serious  games  are  increasingly  used  to  train  and  teach  users  in 
various  settings  such  as  healthcare  [25]  or  education  [26]  and  have  also  been  implemented 
successfully  in  a  therapeutic  setting  [27],  for  example  as  a  treatment  for  depression  [28]. 
Positive  outcomes  have  also  been  found  when  looking  at  serious  games  for  children  and  
adolescents: in their  systematic  reviews, Zayeni,  Raynaud and  Revet  [29]  show  that  serious 
games can be an effective tool in psychotherapy, while Balaintharanathan, Palmer, Arellano and 
Arcand [30] found that serious games are effective especially at imparting knowledge, but also 
at changing behaviours. 

Few serious games have sought to improve social skills, especially in a classroom setting and 
for a general population. Existing social skills games have largely been developed for a target group 
of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [for an overview, see 31], but most of these games 
are single-player, or played in pairs or with a facilitator. Some other games have been developed 
for a therapeutic setting. In SIDES [32], a cooperative tabletop computer game, students (in groups 
of  four) learn group work skills such as perspective-taking or negotiation skills in a social group 
therapy setting. 

AR learning applications are primarily used in the field of natural science [33, 34]. Again, AR 
games that address social skills are mostly targeted at children with ASD. In a systematic review 
about AR learning applications for children and adolescents with ASD from Khowaja, Banire, Al-
Thani, Sqalli, Aqle, Shah and Salim [35], 20 out of the 30 analysed studies had outcomes related to 
social skills and competences. 

The unique characteristics of AR to implement digital content in  the  real  physical environment 
of the player allow for an exciting new direction in digital learning  – a blended approach, where 
players engage both  digitally and through  ‘real  life’  interaction  with  each other and the AR 
components. This is especially suited to addressing sense of belonging via a digital  setting  while 
still  implementing  real-world  contact.  One  example  of  how  this  was  done in a commercial game 
is Pokémon Go, where players come together and form groups in the real world, in order to fight in 
digital arenas. However, Pokémon Go players are not required to communicate or have real-world 
social interactions in order to achieve their game goals. It has been shown that AR can encourage 
cooperation  and  collaboration  [23]  and  that  collaborative  tasks  with  AR  may  support  learning 
outcomes [36]. However, in existing serious games, collaboration is mostly used as a method to 
reinforce specific  learning  outcomes, rather than being  an  outcome  itself.  For  example,  in  the 
serious  game  Pathomon [37],  players  use  AR  with the primary aim of learning about viruses, but 
also  collaborate  by  sharing  with  each  other  the  correct  ingredient  combination  for  an  antidote. 
However, players did not feel that their actions influenced the actions of others, which demonstrates 
an opportunity for greater emphasis on collaboration. 

The importance of sense of belonging in early  adolescence and the lack  of  interventions aimed 
at improving belonging led to the development of the presented game LINA. While collaboration is 
often used in AR games to achieve other learning goals, few games have tried to improve sense of 
belonging as a main outcome, especially targeting an entire group of people at the same time. Thus, 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
our smartphone social AR game uses a blended approach of real-world and digital interactions to 
improve sense of belonging in early adolescents.

3  DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME LINA 

3.1  Concept 

LINA  is  a  mystery-style  interactive  narrative  experienced  by  an  entire  class  (and  their  teacher) 
together. Players learn that a fictional classmate called Lina has suddenly left the school. Gameplay 
involves solving  the  mystery of  where Lina  –  whose  behaviour  often marked her out as unusual 
– has gone, and why. Players uncover personal artefacts Lina has left behind in the classroom (using 
AR), exchange information with other players, and collaboratively  solve puzzles. First alone, then 
in groups and finally as an entire class, they piece together the  story of a classmate dealing with 
an atypical and stressful home life, caring for a mother suffering from depression. 

The  game  has  been  developed  in  both  English  and  German;  co-development  was  with  early 
adolescents in Austria. The name LINA was chosen for its  acronymic  potential  in  both languages 
– ‘Lina Is Not Alone’ / ‘Lina Ist Nicht Allein’. 

3.1.1 Theoretical  background  of  the  game  LINA.  Increasing  sense  of  belonging  and  reducing 
barriers between individuals and groups is a concept primarily addressed in Contact Theory and 
stigma  research  [38-45].  Contact  Theory  argues  that  interaction  involving  (1)  equal  status,  (2) 
cooperation, (3) a common goal, and (4) authority support, enhances social interactions and reduces 
prejudice between people, especially those perceived as  outsiders  or  belonging  to outlier groups 
[46]. Based on this, LINA has been designed so that (1) all players (including the teacher) start with 
the same amount of information; (2) information needs to be shared via gamified cooperative tasks 
and real-world interactions; (3)  players  are  ultimately  steered towards solving the mystery around 
Lina together; and (4) the game leads players safely and confidently through the game, offering 
appropriate support (e.g. in form of hints). Imagined and vicarious contact have also been shown to 
have effects [46]; thus, imagined contact with an individual affected by mental illness can lead to 
improvements around  stigma,  attitudes and social distance. 

Exposure to the arts in general [47] as well as principles from drama and movement therapy [48, 
49] are potent tools to improve mental health. Storytelling in particular has been used successfully 
to reduce prejudice and stigma, improving attitudes towards characters  with ‘outsider’ status [50, 
51]. LINA therefore immerses players in a story about mental ill health, not only educating them, 
but letting them play an active role in the story. 

In summary, LINA has been designed for school classes to spend time together and improve their 
sense of belonging in the whole group. While scripted peer interactions (role-play) and immersive 
storytelling  provide  a  space  for  safe  communication  and  reflection  on  mental  health,  gamified 
collaborative tasks promote shared positive emotions, breaking down barriers between peers. 

3.1.2 Creative co-development with young people. The game was co-developed with our target 
group of early adolescents throughout the development  process.  All workshops with  schools were 
approved by the Karl Landsteiner University Commission for Scientific Integrity and Ethics (EK 
NR. 1025/2020). 

At the start of development, we held a series of four exploratory workshops with two classes 
(grade 1, age 10-11) in Austria over a period of two months. The aims of these workshops were 
to (1) gain factual information about day-to-day life in grade 1 of a secondary school, as this was 
where LINA would be set; (2) gain information about the cultural lives of  early adolescents such 
as likes and dislikes, activities, media, attitudes and language; (3) gain information about social

dynamics and friendships in their classes, as well as causes and enactments of social conflict; 
and (4) explore the impact and consequences of unusual or transgressive behaviour within these 
groups. Further, students were introduced to the concept of the game to assess its attractiveness 
to them and seek contributions towards storyline and game execution. Information during those 
workshops  was  gathered  via  group  or  whole-class  discussions,  but  also  by  having  students 
draw,  write  or  act  out  ideas  for  the  game.  Lastly,  we  invited  adolescents  to  write  private, 
anonymous letters both to the game development team and directly to Lina, to give them the 
opportunity to share thoughts and ideas they might not wish to share publicly. Insights from 
these workshops strongly influenced development of the game. The resulting collection of artwork, 
for example, helped the lead artist set a style for the game (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 for examples of 
how student drawings from co-development were translated into the game).

Fig. 2. Teddy bear – Student artwork (left and middle left), artwork for the game (middle right), AR object 
in the game (right). 

In addition to co-development with adolescents, we conducted focus groups with four female 
adult participants who grew up with a parent with mental  illness, to  ensure  our  story  felt truthful 
and  reflected  their  reality.  The  aim  of  these  conversations  was  to  find  out  about  the impact of 
having a parent with mental illness on their lives as early adolescents,  exploring personal stories 
of incidents at school and the school-home dynamic. The main insights gained from these focus 
groups  were  that  there  was  not  one  generic  lived  experience  but  many  and  varied  specific 
experiences, which were often  quite distinct;  that young  people in this situation do not necessarily 
recognise  their  home  life  as  different  because  it’s  the  only  one  they  know;  and  that  they 
instinctively seek to protect and normalise their parent(s) and parenting. These insights, as well as 
ideas for incidents and situations, influenced  the  development  of  the storyline around Lina and 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
her mother.

3.1.3 Storyline – De-stigmatising mental health problems. Lina, who  joined  the  school midway 
through  the  academic  year,  had  not  moved  past  newcomer  /  ‘outsider’  status  when,  just as 
suddenly, she departed. The class is left with an enigma around Lina – who she really was, where 
she’s gone, and what to make of her short time with them. But Lina has pre-empted this: each player 
finds  a  (virtual)  notepad  underneath  their  desk  that  Lina  has  left  for  them,  which reveals a 
series of puzzles and challenges she has set around how her classmates saw her. In absence, 
Lina  leads  the  players  on  a  journey  of  discovery  around  their  classroom,  finding  (virtual) 
objects and messages that she has deliberately left behind. Each artefact prompts fresh memories 
around  how  students  (including  the  player’s  fictional  character)  experienced  and  interacted 
with Lina, what kind of person she was, and what happened during her brief time in the class – 
for example, Lina’s conflict with the teacher when she came to school wearing inappropriate 
shoes, or her guardedness around her diary, which could only be opened with a key kept on a 
string around her neck. The teacher, too, discovers scraps of information about Lina, though 
these raise more questions than answers – questions their students will be able to answer. 

By the end of the game, players have discovered  that Lina lived  with  just her  mother, and that 
the two of them frequently moved, in part as a consequence of her mother’s mental health issues. 
Some of Lina’s unusual behaviours in class can be attributed to this life circumstance. For example, 
she was cautious about making friends because she anticipated moving again; she was reluctant to 
allow people to see where she lived; she had responsibilities towards being prepared for school (e.g. 
having  the  right  kit)  that  other  children  do  not  have.  At  one  point  she  attended parents evening 
herself,  in  lieu  of  her  mother.  At  the  end,  it  emerges  that  Lina’s  mother  has  realised  that  their 
situation  is neither  sustainable nor fair  on Lina, and that  they have  moved one final time, to live 
with Lina’s aunt and cousins while her mother seeks long-term treatment. 

3.1.4 Gameplay – endorsing sense of belonging. Gameplay, which lasts up to one hour, begins 
with  every  student  sat  in  their  usual  place.  Each  player  has  a  smartphone  with  headphones 
attached,  through  which  they  hear  an  introduction  about  themselves:  they  are  a  fictional  
student, in a classroom just like the one they are playing in. The teacher (who has also been 
introduced to their fictional alter-ego) begins the morning register in a guided roleplay scene, 
where smartphone screens tell players what to say and when (Fig. 3). It becomes apparent that 
Lina (who is not played by any of the players) has been removed from the register. The teacher 
does not know where she has gone or why.

Players  then  receive  a  message  from  Lina,  telling  them  to  look under  their  desk,  where  they 
discover, through the smartphone camera, a personalised (digital) notepad (using floor-detecting 
technology  and  AR)  which  guides  them  through  the  game  (Fig.  4).  The  notepad  directs  players 
towards  specific  physical  (printed)  markers  which  have  been  preset  around  the  classroom. 
Scanning the correct marker reveals an artefact belonging to Lina (AR object, see Fig. 5) which 
prompts a voiceover in which the player-character recalls incidents involving Lina’s time in 
their class related to that object.

Fig. 5. Finding objects with AR in LINA. 

Players  learn  different  information  about  Lina  depending  on  which  markers  they  have  been 
directed to scan. In the next part of the game, players are directed to find a specific partner, who 
will have acquired different information. Contact happens both on a digital and a physical level. 
The two players prove they have found each other by touching their phones together (using Near-
Field  Communication,  NFC,  Fig.  6).  They  then  cooperate  to  solve  a  puzzle  involving sharing 
information  about  the  objects  they  have  found  (Fig.  7),  so  that  by  working  together, each 
player finds out more about Lina.

Fig. 7. A pair of players who need to collaborate to solve a puzzle. They work on Player B’s screen (right) 
to determine which objects they have found. The resulting number unlocks the next marker to find on 
Player A’s screen (left). 

After pair interactions, players are directed towards new groups of  three  to  four  people (again, 
using NFC) to solve another puzzle; this leads the group to the teacher, with whom they share what 
they’ve learnt and who shares a further piece of information with them. Once each group  has  talked 
to  the  teacher,  they  take  part  in  a  fun  challenge,  tasked  with  finding  every marker hidden in 
the classroom within a set time. Player then discover a piece of paper (floor- detecting  technology 
and  AR)  on  the  floor  –  a  page  of  Lina’s  diary.  Directed  to  form  a  circle, each player reads out 
their fragment of diary (Fig. 8), bringing together  the  remaining information  and  so  solving  the 
mystery  around  why  Lina  has  left.  After  this,  everyone  is  asked to return to their desks and be 
themselves again. In a guided post-game discussion, the teacher’s smartphone offers a selection of 
discussion questions for the class to reflect upon (Fig. 9).

3.2  Development 

3.2.1 Interdisciplinary and international collaboration.The pan-European interdisciplinary research 
group D.O.T. was set up to address social connectedness in  early adolescents as a protective factor 
in mental health, exploring how arts-informed digital interventions could support social wellbeing. 
LINA is the product of an interdisciplinary and international collaborative process between a variety 
of  disciplines and countries, with  a focus on the interplay between technical development, arts, 
and psychology. The game is written and directed  by  a  professional  playwright,  theatre  director 
and  creative  practitioner  from  the  UK, who worked closely together with Austrian psychologists, 
and  computer  scientists  from Portugal and the UK, to implement storyline and  psychoeducational 
content 
into  the  digital  game.  Additional  AR  programming  and  additional  cooperation  with 
industry  partners  such  as  a  professional  illustrator  to  create  visuals  (e.g.  Lina’s  artwork  and 
handwriting),  and  a professional composer for the soundtrack, ensured a  polished  audio-visual 
experience. Voiceover was performed by young people equivalent in age to  the  characters  they 
were  playing,  plus  adult  actors  to  represent  the  teacher  (see  acknowledgements  for  further 
information). 

Influences  for  LINA  include  immersive  theatre  (for  example  the  work  of  the  British  theatre 
company Punchdrunk), participatory theatre and previous experiments around digital-theatre 
crossovers; walking simulator narrative games (e.g. Gone Home, Firewatch); and adolescent pop 
culture (e.g. the book and television series  13 Reasons Why), encompassing the topic of mental 
health in the mystery narrative underpinning the game. 

3.2.2  Iterative  co-development  of  prototypes.  After  development  began,  different  prototypes  were 
tested  with  various  classes  at  various  time  points.  In  an  iterative  process,  ideas  and  feedback 
were  integrated  in  each  subsequent  version  of  the  game,  thus  continuously  adapting  the  game 
to early adolescents’ needs and  ensuring  that the world  and story of the  game felt convincing and 
compelling.  In  these  workshops,  we  explored  initial  interactions  with  the  smartphone, difficulty 
level (at a technical level, for game flow and understanding of storyline) and general opinions about 
the game with early adolescents (see acknowledgements  for  participating schools). Findings from 
these workshops influenced further development (e.g. refinement to puzzle design, refinement to 
UI and UX, implementing a time-delayed hint system for phases of gameplay which some players 
found difficult). 

3.2.3 Technical development. LINA was developed in Unity1 Engine, which provided the quick 
prototyping  learning  curve  needed  to  create  an  initial  proof-of-concept.  Augmented  Reality  is 
provided by Vuforia2 Engine in two different ways: Target Recognition uses an algorithm to identify 
images (markers) in the camera feed and place 3D models in a position related to the recognized 
marker; Ground Plane recognizes where the physical floor is and  places  digital objects there. 

Given the requirement for multiplayer interaction, LINA follows a server-client architecture with 
two main components acting simultaneously: (1) The “LINA Master”  application, running on a 
computer with Microsoft Windows, responsible for creating the game room, setting up, starting and 
managing  the  game,  storing  the  state  of  the game  and  synchronizing  the game  for

12 

all  client  players;  (2)  The  “LINA  Client”  app  running  on  smartphones  with  Android  operating 
system,  where  the  players  interact  with  the  game  itself.  The  communication  between  these  two 
components is handled by the Photon3 Multiplayer Game Engine for Unity, a  service  that provides 
a server hosting the game room. 

Beyond AR, the game uses Near-Field Communication (NFC), which allows two mobile devices 
to recognise and communicate with each other when in close proximity. One device registers as a 
sender, the other as a receiver; when devices are held back-to-back, a one-way message  is  sent. 
This  is  particularly  useful  in  making  sure  two  players  have  found  each  other. The game also 
takes advantage of the impact of multiple phones in  a single contained space by, for example, using 
each player’s phone as a separate audio speaker to create a polyphonic soundscape with different 
instruments placed in different parts of the room, or by creating synchronised ‘choreography’ of 
players by sending all players an instruction to move (e.g. stand up, or form a circle) at the same 
time. 

Iterative development of LINA consisted of three major phases: (1) An initial  proof-of- concept, 
which explored the augmented reality feature and modes of communicating  with multiple players. 
(2) A first prototype, that incorporated placeholder 3D models and explored collaborative gameplay 
between the players. This prototype had no networking component and was completely offline. (3) 
The final prototype, with a complex multiplayer networking component and the introduction of new 
features like Near Field Communication, a checkpoint system to allow resumption of progress in 
the event of a technical problem, fully-animated 3D models, new music and narration sound files,

The  aim  of  the  evaluation  study  was  to  (1)  quantitatively  assess  usability  of  the  prototype  of 
LINA  with  a  questionnaire  and  (2)  qualitatively  assess  usability  and  efficacy  of  the  game  by 
conducting  focus  groups.  LINA  was  tested  for  both  usability  and  efficacy  during  a  series  of 
workshops with early adolescents in June and July 2021. Five classes participated in the study, with 
a  total  of  91  participants  between  10  and  13  years  (agemean=11.41; 47%  female,  50% male,  3% 
missing data). The participants first played the game (~1 hour) and then  filled  out  a questionnaire 
about usability of the game. Lastly, they discussed  their  experiences  in  small focus groups (~10-
15 mins).  The workshops were delivered by five trained workshop leaders, who set up the game, 
helped players during gameplay (e.g.  with  technical difficulties)  and led the focus groups. 

4.1  Materials and analysis 

The German version of the Game User Experience Satisfaction Scale [GUESS-18; 52] was used to 
assess  usability,  feasibility  and  acceptability  of  the  game.  The  questionnaire  consists  of  nine 
constructs  (two  items  per  construct;  18  items  in  total):  usability/playability,  narratives,  play 
engrossment,  enjoyment,  creative  freedom,  audio  aesthetics,  personal  gratification,  social 
connectivity, and visual aesthetics. The answers on the 5-point Likert scale range from 1 (“don’t 
agree at all”) to 5 (“totally agree”). Analysis was done with SPSS [53]. We analysed descriptive 
statistics with mean scores for all subscales. Considering there are still sex differences in the use

13 

of video games (only 36% of gamers were female in the fourth quarter of 2020, see [54]), we also 
considered sex differences in the analysis of the questionnaire. Due to  missing  normal distribution 
(tested with Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk test), we analysed sex differences with the 
Mann-Whitney-U-Test. 

After playing the game, we conducted semi-structured discussions with  small focus groups (3-
4 per group). We aimed to qualitatively assess three main questions: (1) how participants enjoyed 
the general experience of the game, including elements like storyline, audio-visuals, difficulty level, 
and technical adaptation; (2) whether participants understood the storyline and what the game is 
trying to convey (de-stigmatisation); and (3) how participants experienced the cooperative parts of 
the game and  whether  they felt  it  helped their connectedness with their peers (sense of belonging). 
Discussions were recorded and later transcribed. We used principles of thematic analysis to group 
themes according to the research questions. 

4.2  Results and discussion 

Results of the GUESS-18 can be found in Table 1 (see Appendix for analysis on item level). Internal 
consistency  was  good  with  Cronbach  alpha  α=  .83.  The  overall  usability  score  was 
33.64.  The  highest  ranked  construct  was  enjoyment  (mean  score=4.42),  closely  followed  by 
social connectivity (mean score=4.37). The high scores in narratives, audio, and visual aesthetics 
might reflect the advantages of collaborating with  industry  professionals  when  creating  a serious 
game.  Looking  at  the  medians  of  the  subscales  (see  boxplots  in  Fig.  10),  four  subscales  had  a 
median value of 3.5. The lower scores in the subscale creative freedom could be expected, as the 
game is delivered in a structured way (including scripted roleplay and clear instructions) and was 
not  intended  to  leave  a  lot of  freedom  during gameplay,  though  this  is  a  decision  that could  be 
reassessed in future  work. Engrossment scores might have been lower due to  the fact that players 
are  not  supposed  to  be  completely  submerged  in  the  game.  One  item  reads,  “I  forget  what  is 
happening in the outside world  while I  play”, but due to  the blended approach, players are also 
playing  in  the  ‘outside  world’.  Lower  gratification  scores  may  also  be  due  to  the  game  being 
collaborative  rather  than  competitive,  though  may  also  suggest  more  could  be  done  to  reward 
progress. Usability scores might have been affected by technical problems during gameplay of what 
was still a prototype of a complex piece of new software (see results of focus group discussions for 
further information). 

There  were  no  significant  sex  differences  for  the  overall  score,  yet  some  subscales  revealed 
sex  differences.  Female  participants  showed  significantly  higher  scores  in  visual  aesthetics, 
enjoyment  and  narratives,  while  males  showed  higher  scores  in  usability/playability,  which 
suggests that boys found the game easier to control while girls  appreciated  the  overall experience, 
visuals and story of the game more. This shows that we succeeded in creating an experience that 
appeals to both sexes, but also indicates that males may have an advantage in controlling the game 
more  easily, perhaps due to being more experienced in gaming, but may be less receptive to its 
narrative and aesthetics. 

Although our aim was to assess usability (not efficacy) with the GUESS-18, the results also 
look promising in terms of expected efficacy and outcomes of LINA. The two highest-ranked 
constructs  were enjoyment  and  social connectivity,  which reflects  our  aim to  bring  students 
together and increase sense of belonging (reflected by the high score in the social connectivity 
subscale) in a fun way (reflected by the high score in the enjoyment subscale).

For  the  focus  groups,  the  feedback  about  the  game  was  very  positive  in  general.  Almost  all 
adolescents enjoyed playing it and would play this or a further  episode of the game again. There 
was  some  critical  feedback  for  specific  parts  of  the  game.  The  main  problems  adolescents  had 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15 

during gameplay were due to  technical problems and  waiting times (especially in the group phase, 
where some groups were faster with puzzle solving than others), which  interrupted the flow and 
led to some players feeling bored. In terms of storyline, some wished for more explanation at the 
end, or mentioned what could be further explained in putative subsequent “episodes” of the game. 
Lina’s home life, her relationship with her mother, and how her life is now that she has moved back 
were topics of interest. However, adolescents realised that the storyline was about de-stigmatising 
(see quotes in Table 2). Answers relating to sense  of belonging showed that adolescents were aware 
that the main aim  of  the  game  is  to  bring players together and  improve class climate, and also 
thought that the game was able to achieve that (see Table 2).

Quotes from adolescents 

R: How did you like it? Tell me! 
A1: Nice, very nice. 
A2: Very good, very very good. 
A3: 100 out of 10! 
A4: I say 8 out of 10. 

What did you like/dislike? 

Sometimes it was complicated when something 
didn’t work, but apart from that I really liked it. 

The only difficult thing was that we had to wait 
for everyone, because they needed more  time for 
something. 

When I heard about it, I thought that only the 
children were playing and I thought it was cool 
that the teachers were also playing. 

I also thought it was cool that we got the names, 
because then we also played the role, that we had 
to stand up in the classroom and say "Good 
morning, Mr. Gruber”. 

Sense of 
belonging 

What do you think was the 
purpose of playing LINA 
with your class? 

A: That we build up more contact with the class. 
R: Did that work? 
A: Yep 

What, if anything, do you 
think LINA has helped you 
and your class with? 

I think this has also strengthened the class 
community a bit because we all worked together. 

So, you play it together in the class. Because then 
everyone worked closer together and that was also

fun and that you simply do more together as a 
class. 
It’s also fun, because you also do something with 
those you actually do not have so much contact 
with 

I think with Lina it was also a little bit that you 
learn that you do not have to exclude people and 
should not. 

R: And why do you think we are here today to 
play the game with you? 
A: So that the kids who play it realize that they 
shouldn't bully others. Or judge them for 
anything. 

And Lina has left all these items that if you have 
solved the puzzle you can also understand why 
she had to leave now and in any case I really liked 
the game and it was very great. 

5  CONCLUSION 

In this paper we introduce LINA, a smartphone AR serious game that is played by a whole class 
of early adolescents to reduce stigma around mental health and improve sense of belonging. The 
game was developed by an interdisciplinary and international team and  involved  early adolescents 
as  co-developers  throughout  development.  Both  quantitative  and  qualitative  data from  the 
evaluation study showed high acceptability of the game, and qualitative data show promising results 
regarding  efficacy.  A  limitation  of  the  study  is  that  the  data  for  efficacy  are only  preliminary 
due  to  their  qualitative  nature.  We  plan  to  conduct  a  further  evaluation  study to quantitatively 
test efficacy of the game. 

A  major  strength  of  LINA  lies  in  the  interdisciplinary  co-development  process:  collaborating 
with professional industry partners especially for narrative, visuals and audio  increased  the chance 
of a high-quality game. Involving early adolescents throughout the development process created a 
game that reflects the voices of its target group. 

For future work, co-development left us with an abundance of material and ideas that  could still 
be  implemented,  suggesting  that  gameplay  and  narrative  could  be  sustained  across  multiple 
episodes.  While  the  current  version  of  the  game  is  played in  one  session,  there  is  the  potential 
to rework and  expand LINA as an  intervention lasting  several weeks, playing a  new episode each 
week. 

The impact of LINA may surpass the current game, in that it showcases the general potential 
of this form of social AR gameplay in educational, psychotherapeutic or entertainment settings 
–  a  collective  experience  that  fosters  a  greater  sense  of  belonging  while  creating  a  safe 
environemnt  in  which  to  engage  players in  a  potentially  challenging  topic.  The  fact  that  an 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17 

increasingly ubiquitous digital device such as a smartphone acts as the facilitator of the game makes 
it cost-effective: easy to distribute digitally, and easy to implement without external facilitators. The 
affinity of adolescents for digital media makes them an especially appropriate target for this kind 
of  intervention;  the  format  might  also  be  used  for  building  sense  of  belonging  in  other 
environments,  for  example  in  a  workspace  with  a  group  of  adults  or  with any  other  group  that 
wants  or  needs  an  entertaining  way  to  connect  both  digitally  and  in  the real world. In that sense, 
beyond being a stand-alone intervention, LINA could be seen as a prototype for “Augmented Social 
Play” interventions, which could be adapted to the  specific needs of the target group while always 
endorsing sense of belonging.
