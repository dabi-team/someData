ABSTRACT: We propose a new label-free ultrasonic sensor, which comprises a slot wave-guide

and double silicon-on-insulator (SOI) slot micro-ring resonators. The all-optical sensors do not

suffer from electromagnetic interference. We choose to integrate a silicon slot double micro-ring

(SDMR) resonators in an acoustically resonant membrane. Optimization of the several key

structural parameters is investigated to achieve the mode-field distributions of transmission

spectrum based on Comsol Multiphysics software. Our numerical studies show that the proposed

ultrasonic sensor offers higher sensitivity and a larger detection frequency range than conventional

piezoelectric based ultrasound transducer. For a SDMR system with an area of

1. Introduction

Integrated silicon photonic devices are widely applied in optical sensing,

including

bio-medicine and environment monitoring. Silicon photonic devices can offer high compatibility

with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes and silicon-on

-insulator (SOI) technology[1]. The various optical structures have been widely investigated,

including Bragg gratings[2], micro-ring resonators [3], photonic crystal micro-cavities[4-5].

The low-cost, high-sensitivity, and label-free miniaturized ultrasound sensor is a key factor to

obtaining high-resolution medical images and reducing misdiagnosis during the treatment of

diseases. Fabrication of miniaturized ultrasound sensor that have a size below half of the

wavelength of the ultrasound is challenging with conventional piezoelectric based ultrasound

transducer, which suffers from geometry-dependent electrical noise and results in both poor depth

resolution and inaccurate quantification of optical absorption information. In recent years, new

ultrasound

detection methods were

put

forward,

there

are

four

categories:

(1)

free-space-optics-based,

including etalons[6], dielectric multilayer

interference

filters[7],

Mach-Zehnder interferometer[8];(2) fiber-optics-based, such as fiber gratings[9]; (3) photonic

integrated circuits, including micro-ring resonators[10], micro-sphere resonators[11], micro-disk

resonators[12], and optics-fluids micro-ring resonators[13]; and (4) optical-interface-based,

including surface plasmon resonance (SPR)[14], and metamaterials[15]. Considering the polymer

micro-ring doesn’t suffer from electromagnetic interference, the absorption of polymer is very

small when the incident wavelength around 780nm .Over the last decade, Guo and co-workers have

reported on ultrasound sensor that are based on a polymer micro-ring resonator [16]. In 2012, Xie

et.al proposed a possible to use the photo-acoustic pressure perturbation to generate ultrasound in

2

the tissue to be photo-acoustic imaging. A micro-ring resonator with radius of

m30

and a cross

section of1.4



1.4m


m

, the refractive index in the coupling medium is modulated, an ultra-high

Q-factor of

5
3 10

and a low noise-equivalent pressure (NEP) of 20Pa over 75MHz bandwidth

were obtained [17].

A important class of ultrasound sensors are based on slotted wave-guides having an increased

sensitivity. The concept of slot wave-guide was first proposed in 2004[18]. Between two

high-index wave-guide layers, there is a wave-guide slot of tens of nanometeres with material of

low index of refraction. The electric field discontinuity at the interface between high index

contrast materials enables high optical confinement inside a gap region of low index material.

Using slot wave-guide structures in the micro-ring resonators can improve the sensitivity, has a

better Q -factor[19-20]. They have a lot of applications such as refractive index sensing [21],

optical manipulation of bio-molecules [22], and all-optical signal processing [23]. In 2017, a novel

slot SU8 polymer micro-ring resonator ultrasound detector was proposed [24], the sensitivity is

165.7 times larger than conventional piezoelectric based ultrasound transducer. Considering the

micro-ring ultrasonic sensor is usually in an aqueous environment, air-coupled non-contact

ultrasound detection using capillary-based optical ring resonators was first investigated [25].

In this study, considering one micro-ring resonator has inherent limitations in the pass band

structure, series coupling or parallel coupling structure double micro-ring resonator was put

forward[26]. We propose the use of slot double micro-ring (SDMR) resonators to sense ultrasound.

The basic idea here is based on the same principle as that of Ref. [27] and Ref. [28] and

demonstrate that the structure employed in Ref.[29]. For slot micro-ring resonator, the optical

power is trapped into slot wave-guides, which leads to an increase in the effective refractive index

3

of the medium surrounding SDMR system. The SDMR system can be integrated in a mechanical

structure to enhance sound-induced deformation and hence shift its optical resonance wavelengths.

The ultrasound pressure will affect the optical mode of the slot wave-guide,

the influence

accumulates during the circulation of the light wave along SDMR system. A 3D FDTD

simulations are performed and the sensing performances observed for optimize geometrical design

parameters. We evaluate the performance of our sensor with varying sound pressures and light

powers.

2. Principle and sensor structure

Fig.1 shows the schematic diagram of the proposed SDMR sensor designed on SOI

technology. A 3D model of the input wave-guide and slotted ring coupling was constructed in

COMSOL. In order to obtain outstanding performance of the SDMR system, the geometry of the

slot wave-guide and the SDMR system should be optimized. The dimensional parameters of

The novel dual resonator design in this paper is configured such that any structural induced

The slot wave-guide is constructed with two bus wave-guide with the gap embedded by GaN,

which is serving as light input and output ports. The refractive index of the top layer

A quasi-TE mode incident beam is injected into the SDMR system through the input port as

presented in Fig.1(a). As the transmission spectrum of the two ring resonators is the product of the

transmission spectra of the individual resonators, it will exhibit two resonance peaks of the

respective ring resonators. The Q -factor can be as high as

1.24 

610

in Fig.1(b).

Based on optical resonance, the change in wave-guide cross section directly alters effn of the guided

mode, which results in a shift in the resonant frequency that can be conveniently monitored by

measuring the modulation of transmitted optical signal through the bus wave-guide.[30]

3. Power flow distribution and TE-mode distribution

The slotted ring design was adopted for this model in order to reduce the bend loss in the rings and

so confine the circulating fields to central slots of rings.

within the slot wave-guides, the total internal reflection of the light propagating in the SDMR

system interacts with cladding via an evanescent tail.

We investigate numerically the quasi-TE fundamental mode confined in the SDMR structure

based on 3D FEM method. We take the radius of micro-ring resonator, width of slot, width of

wave-guide and the gap are set to m5

, 75nm , 350nm and 290nm , respectively. The micro-ring

and the bus wave-guide have the same width,

implying these are single mode around the

operational wavelength of 1550nm .

As shown in Figs.3 (a)-(b), the electric field in the immediate vicinity of the silicon rails is

greatly enhanced. This can be explained by large discontinuity of the E -field at the interface. The

SDMR system can only support fundamental TE0 mode.

4. The principle and characteristic of ultrasonic sensor

The incident acoustic wave induces a strain field, the micro-ring resonator is sensitive to

6

deformation which may be expressed in terms of strain (relative elongation)[31]

We assume that the SDMR structure is completely submerged in deionized water with

refractive index of 1.333. The water layer serving as the medium for ultrasound wave incident

from the top of GaN cladding. The incident ultrasonic wave slightly deforming the SDMR

resonator, we choose to use the SiO2 membrane to achieve a large deformation of the SDMR

resonator.

pressure changes from 1MPa to 10MPa on

effn

is illustrated in Fig.4(b).The influence of

displacement on

effn

is illustrated in Fig.4(c).

The deformation causes a change in circumference, a change in cross-section of wave-guide

and a change in

effn of wave-guide and cladding (due to the photo-elastic effect), these changes

result in a shift of optical resonance [20]. The shift of resonance wavelength and hence a direct

measure of the deflection off the membrane. The relation between dimensions of the membrane

and the pressure-induced strain in the SDMR resonator is nontrivial.

.

We numerically simulated the pressure-induced deformation of the SiO2 acoustical membrane

using a FEM (implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics, see Fig.5(a)). The curvature of the SiO2

membrane results in a position-dependent strain that scales linearly with the distance (see Fig.

5(b)). We record the strain at a point

m0.056

below the surface of the SiO2 membrane at the

center of the SiO2 membrane.

5. The principle and characteristic of acoustic sensor

COMSOL Multiphysics software. Light is sent via optical fiber to sensor, then incident ultrasonic
