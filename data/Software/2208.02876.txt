ON ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS IN FINITE FIELDS

Abstract. In this paper, we explore the existence of m-terms arithmetic pro-

gressions in Fqn with a given common diﬀerence whose terms are all primitive

elements, and at least one of them is normal. We obtain asymptotic results for

≥

4 and concrete results for m

m
, where the complete list of excep-
tions when the common diﬀerence belongs to F∗
q is obtained. The proofs combine
character sums, sieve estimates, and computational arguments using the software

1. Introduction

Let q be a prime power, and let n > 1 be an integer. As usual, Fq denotes
the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements, and Fqn denotes the unique ﬁeld extension of Fq of
degree n. The multiplicative group F∗
qn is cyclic whose generators are called primitive
is an Fq-basis for Fqn
elements. We say that g
as a vector space. The Primitive Normal Basis Theorem (see [15]) ensures that a
primitive normal element in Fqn always exists (see [9] for a computer-free proof).
Other problems in this direction concern the existence of a set with some prescribed

g, gq, . . . , gqn−1

Fqn is normal if

∈

{

}

property whose elements are all primitives (see e.g. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14]).

There is an extensive literature dealing with consecutive primitive elements, and

here it is required that the amount of consecutive elements must be at most the

characteristic of the ﬁnite ﬁeld. For instance, Cohen (see [6, 7, 8]) proved that if
q > 7, then Fq contains two consecutive primitive elements. Later, it has been
proved, in [5, Theorem 1], that if q > 169 is odd, then there are always three
consecutive primitive elements in Fq. Moreover, the precise values q

which the latter is false are q = 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 25, 29, 61, 81, 121, and 169. Also in

[5], the similar problem with four consecutive primitive elements was studied, and

it was conjectured that any ﬁnite ﬁeld with more than 2401 elements contains such

consecutive primitive elements. This result was recently settled in [12].

In this paper, we discuss the existence of m-terms arithmetic progressions in Fqn
with a given common diﬀerence whose terms are primitive elements, and at least
one of them being normal. It is clear that the characteristic of Fq must be at least
m. We obtain asymptotic and concrete results, depending on whether m

In the particular cases where either m = 2 or m = 3, we provide the
complete list of exceptions when the common diﬀerence belongs to F∗
q. In all these
cases the numerical calculations are done using SageMath [17]. More speciﬁcally,

we will prove the following results.

The proof relies on character sums and sieve methods that provide an inequality-

like condition that guarantees the existence of such arithmetic progressions. The

case m = 3 extends the results of Cohen, Silva and Trudgian on three consecutive

primitive elements, as well as the case m = 2 that extends the results of Cohen on

two consecutive primitive elements. For this, we combine further sieving estimates

with computational arguments.

For β

∈

F∗

q and m = 3, we obtain the complete list of exceptions.

As a consequence, we obtain the following result concerning three primitive ele-

ments in arithmetic progression.

The case β = 1 of the corollary above was proved by Cohen in [6, 7, 8].

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we introduce some standard

notations and results on arithmetic functions and characters.

In Section 3, we

prove some inequality-like conditions that guarantee the existence of arithmetic

progressions formed by primitive elements such that one of its terms is normal,

as well as the sieving version of these inequalities.

In Section 4, we obtain some

asymptotic results, including the proof of Theorem 1.1(iii),(iv). Finally, in Section

5 we present the proof of Theorems 1.1(ii) and 1.2, and in Section 6 we present the

prove of Theorems 1.1(i) and 1.4, respectively.

2. Preliminaries

out this paper. We refer the reader to [16] for basic results on ﬁnite ﬁelds.

22(m+1) > m2. Let π(x) be the number of prime numbers up to
6 log 2r > r since r > 8 (in fact, from

Table 8. Possible exceptions for Theorem 1.1(i) with q even.

6.3. Proof of Theorem 1.4. It only remains to verify the values of (q, n) displayed

in Tables 6 and 8. We remove line 13 and adapt lines 11, 14 and 15 of Algorithm 1

element α

for q odd, and we also adapt line 4 in the case where q is even, to search a primitive
Fqn such that α + β is also primitive and either α or α + β is normal.
The only genuine exception found in this case is (q, n, β) = (2, 4, 1). It completes

∈

the proof of Theorem 1.4.

6.4. Proof of Corollary 1.5. This corollary follows directly from Theorem 1.4 and

[8, Theorem A], since for β = 1 we deal with consecutive elements.
