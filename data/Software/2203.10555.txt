ABSTRACT
Context: Addressing women’s under-representation in the soft-
ware industry, a widely recognized concern, requires attracting as
well as retaining more women. Hearing from women practitioners,
particularly those positioned in multi-cultural settings, about their
challenges and and adopting their lived experienced solutions can
support the design of programs to resolve the under-representation
issue. Goal: We investigated the challenges women face in global
software development teams, particularly what motivates women
to leave their company; how those challenges might break down
according to demographics; and strategies to mitigate the identified
challenges. Method: To achieve this goal, we conducted an ex-
ploratory case study in Ericsson, a global technology company. We
surveyed 94 women and employed mixed-methods to analyze the
data. Results: Our findings reveal that women face socio-cultural
challenges, including work-life balance issues, benevolent and hos-
tile sexism, lack of recognition and peer parity, impostor syndrome,
glass ceiling bias effects, the prove-it-again phenomenon, and the
maternal wall. The participants of our research provided different
suggestions to address/mitigate the reported challenges, includ-
ing sabbatical policies, flexibility of location and time, parenthood
support, soft skills training for managers, equality of payment and
opportunities between genders, mentoring and role models to sup-
port career growth, directives to hire more women, inclusive groups
and events, women’s empowerment, and recognition for women’s
success. The framework of challenges and suggestions can inspire
further initiatives both in academia and industry to onboard and
retain women.

LAY ABSTRACT
Women represent less than 24% of employees in software develop-
ment industry and experience various types of prejudice and bias.
Even in companies that care about Diversity & Inclusion, “untying
the mooring ropes" of socio-cultural problems is hard. Hearing from
women, especially those working in a multi-cultural organization,
about their challenges and adopting their suggestions can be vital
to design programs and resolve the under-representation issue. In
this work we work closely with a large software development or-
ganization which invests and believes in diversity and inclusion.
We listened to women and the challenges they face in global soft-
ware development teams of this company and what these women
suggest reduce the problems and increase retention. Our research
showed that women face work-life balance issues and encounter
invisible barriers that prevent them from rising to top positions.
They also suffer micro-aggression and sexism, need to show com-
petence constantly, be supervised in essential tasks, and receive
less work after becoming mothers. Moreover, women miss having
more female colleagues, lack self-confidence and recognition. The
women from the company suggested sabbatical policies, the flexibil-
ity of location and time, parenthood support, soft skills training for
managers, equality of opportunities, role models to support career
growth, directives to hire more women, support groups, and more
interaction between women, inclusive groups and events, women’s
empowerment by publishing their success stories in media and
recognizing their achievements. Our results had been shared with
the company Human Resources department and management and
they considered the diagnosis helpful and will work on actions to
mitigate the challenges that women still perceive.

and its intended customers [51]. Diversity further positively af-
fects productivity by bringing together different perspectives [73]
and fosters innovation and problem-solving capacity, leading to
a healthier work environment [19]. However, women are still un-
derrepresented in the software industry [35]. Reducing the gender
gap in the software industry requires not only attracting, but also
retaining women.

Women1 often face socio-cultural challenges in the software
industry and could decide to leave their jobs (or even the software
industry) if diversity is not a priority [42]. Gender-related incidents
can be so severe that they motivate women to leave a project or
their jobs [55, 72]. Kuechler et al. [40] suggest that women drop
out because their jobs are not aligned to their motivations or due
to the unappealing and hostile social dynamics in their daily work.
Understanding the reasons behind the decision to step out of a
project or role can help create strategies to increase retention.

Challenges faced by women have been largely investigated in the
free and open source software (F/OSS) development context (e.g., [5,
12, 13, 36, 42, 53, 55, 56, 58, 67, 71, 72, 74]). Although there are a few
studies focusing on software companies [14, 52, 54, 78], the results
are still preliminary and more studies are needed to contribute
to theory building. In this context, theory is built by aggregating
results from case studies and related qualitative research by making
comparisons, looking for similarities and differences within the
collected data, and by examining future questions [41].

In this paper, we contribute to this scientific body of knowledge
by reporting a case study in a multi-cultural global software de-
velopment organization from a large company, namely Ericsson,
which is a global private company that has more than 100,000 em-
ployees around the world, and is one of the leading providers of
Information and Communication Technology (ICT). One of the
Diversity & Inclusion business goals of the company is to reach
at least 25% proportion of women in every suborganization of the
company. However, the software development organization still
struggles to attract and retain women and has partnered with ex-
ternal researchers to understand the challenges and strategies from
the point of view of the women themselves. As the phenomenon
under study is complex because it involves different perspectives
and disciplines, it is critical to consider how women perceive and
give meaning to their social reality.

Therefore, our goal is to identify the challenges that women face
in the company, according to them, and investigate the measures
that women recommend to mitigate the identified challenges. To
achieve our goal, we defined the following research questions:
RQ1: What challenges do women face in software teams?
RQ2: What are possible actions to mitigate the identified challenges,
from the women’s perspectives?

To answer our research questions, we collected data through an
online questionnaire that included questions about the challenges
that are currently being faced, reasons women would decide to
leave, and suggestions to increase women’s participation. The ques-
tionnaire was answered by 94 women from a software development

1In this study, we use the term “gender” as a socially constructed concept [11], where
gender identification, display, and performance might or might not align with a per-
son’s sex assigned at birth. To reflect this social concept of gender, we use the term
“women” and “men” as a shorthand for people who self-identify as such.

suborganization of Ericsson. The novelty of the work includes con-
sidering a multi-cultural global software development organization
from a large IT company, breaking down the challenges according
to demographics, identifying challenges that push women out of
the company, and connecting challenges to potential strategies to
attract and retain women from the point of view of the women
themselves, who are on the front lines of the problem.

We introduce our research design in Section 2 and the study
results in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the results and implications
of our results, followed by related work in Section 5, limitations,
and conclusions in Sections 6 and 7.

2 RESEARCH DESIGN
To answer our research questions, we conducted an exploratory
case study [62] via a questionnaire administered to women from
one of the software development suborganizations of Ericsson. In
this section, we describe the case and the phases of planning, data
collection, and analysis.

2.1 The Case and Unit of Analysis
The case and unit of analysis is one of Ericsson’s software devel-
opment organizations. Ericsson is a global and large company that
develops telecommunications-related products. It has more than
100,000 employees who are geographically distributed in several
countries, including India, Sweden, Canada, USA, Poland, Brazil,
and Germany.

To diagnose how the company is doing in terms of gender di-
versity, every year, Ericsson2 publishes a diversity report with the
percentage of employees who identify themselves as women3. The
company has a goal to achieve at least 25% of women as employ-
ees in all suborganizations. This percentage was achieved for the
whole company in 2020, but not in a consistent way in every sub-
organization. One of the software development organizations still
dominated by men (the name of which is omitted for confidentially
reasons) decided to conduct a systematic research to understand
the viewpoint of the women who currently work at the company,
in order to plan informed and bottom-up actions to mitigate the re-
ported challenges. The company is interested in understanding the
challenges women report as well as their suggestions to improve
the current situation, as a contemporary phenomenon within its
real-life context [80]. This case study was collaboratively conducted
by one researcher from the company and three outsiders.

2.2 Data Collection
We administered an online questionnaire 4 using the Qualtrics tool5
to employees from the software development suborganization who
self-identify as women. We opted for a questionnaire instead of
interviews to increase participation and coverage of the research.
The questionnaire was designed to understand the state of the prob-
lem, asking open questions about the challenges faced, the reasons
that drove women they know to leave the company, and their sug-
gestions to retain more women in the company. The demographic

questions were the last part of the questionnaire, and were chosen
to help us investigate possible relations between groups. Although
family is universal to all genders, women culturally face a greater
pressure to balance work and family [70]. Considering women as
the target population of the present study, besides country, age, and
experience, we included demographics questions to understand pos-
sible intersections of the challenges and family status. All questions
were optional to increase the response rate by making respondents
more comfortable [57]. After proofreading and testing in multiple
browsers and devices, we invited three participants to pilot the
questionnaire so we could collect feedback and measure the time
to answer. No modification of the questionnaire was necessary, and
we discarded these initial answers.

The managers of the company software teams sent emails to the
women on their teams with the questionnaire link. Every week, the
first author of this paper followed up with the company’s manager
to check the number of answers and identify sites that needed
additional encouragement.

The questionnaire was open for answers between June 11 and
July 20, 2021. Our questionnaire received 94 non-blank answers.
We report the demographics of the respondents in Table 1. Most
of the respondents were residents of India (65.6%), less than 35
years old (50.0%), married (62.8%), living with children (52.1%),
having more than 10 years of experience in the software industry
(45.7%) and less than 5 years working in the company (35.1%). A
balanced proportion of respondents have and do not have children
living with them. The sample mirrors the company’s numbers. In
2020, the prevalent nationality (55%) of the employees from the
studied suborganization was from India. Although we do not have
data about the employees’ age of each suborganization, 31% of the
overall number of employees age less than 35 years old. The other
demographics are not measured by the company’s annual report.
We filtered our data to consider only valid responses. We manu-
ally inspected the open text questions, looking for blank answers.
Instead of removing the entire response when one of the questions
was blank or did not report challenges or suggestions, we sepa-
rated data into two datasets of 94 answers each: one dataset for
challenges and one dataset for suggestions. Then, we named each
respondent from S1 to S94, removed blanks for each dataset (3 re-
moved from challenges and 15 for suggestions). Next, we removed
the answers that were not informing any challenge or suggestion
(27 removed from challenges who reported that they do not face
any challenge and 9 from the suggestions who reported having no
proposed solutions). The final step was to check potential dupli-
cate participation, even though the tool used in our investigation
(Qualtrics) has mechanisms to prevent multiples responses from
the same participant. The final challenges’ dataset had 64 answers,
while the suggestions’ dataset had 70 answers.

2.3 Data Analysis
To answer both RQ1 and RQ2, we analyzed the responses to the
open questions about challenges, reasons for leaving, and sugges-
tions to increase women’s participation in the company. The first
author qualitatively analyzed the answers for the open questions by
inductively applying open coding[49] to organize what participants
reported. We then organized our categories following concepts

from existent theories, such as sexism (hostile and benevolent) [27],
impostor syndrome [16], maternal wall [75], prove-it again [7],
glass ceiling [37, 64], work-life balance issues [28], lack of peer
parity [22], and lack of recognition [4]. We built post-formed codes,
having three of the authors conducting card sorting sessions [68],
including discussing the codes and categorization until reaching
consensus about the the codes and the corresponding literature.

After completing the qualitative analysis, we checked the dis-
tribution of answers categorized in each challenge. From the 64
women who reported they face some type(s) of challenges, 34 re-
ported challenges related to only one category, 25 to two different
categories, 3 to three categories, and 2 women reported challenges
related to four categories. We also used descriptive statistics to sum-
marize the responses and their association with the demographics
data [77].

To analyze how the challenges differ according to individual
characteristics, we segmented our sample based on experience in
software industry (experienced: ≥ 10 years of experience vs. less
experienced: ≤ 10 years of experience), tenure or years in com-
pany(more years in company: ≥ 10 years in company vs. less years
in company: ≤ 10 years in company), age (older: ≥ median, 35 years
old vs. younger: < median, 35 years old), married or not, and lives,
or not, with children.

See supplementary material6 for additional details, including the
answers to the demographics, the open questions and the qualitative
analysis codes.

Next, we calculated the odds ratio for each challenge and demo-

graphic information. We interpreted the results as follows:

• if Odds Ratio = 1, both groups are equally distributed for

the reported challenge.

• if Odds Ratio > 1, the likelihood for the reported challenge
is higher for the first group (in our case: experienced, older
than 35, married and living with children).

• if Odds Ratio < 1, the likelihood for the reported challenge
is higher for the second group (in our case: novices, younger
than 35 years, single or divorced, without children).

3 STUDY RESULTS
In this section, we present the results of our investigation, which
are grouped by research question.

3.1 RQ1: What challenges do women face in

software development teams?

We found eight challenge categories, as presented in Fig. 1. We
marked with an asterisk (*) the challenges reported by at least
one person as a reason to leave the company. Table 2 presents the
number of participants whose responses fit in each category. In the
following, we present more details about our findings organized by
challenge category.

3.1.1 Work-Life Balance Issues. Our participants reported that be-
fore the COVID-19 pandemic the company was strict to the
physical location and many women left due to facing the “trail-
ing spouse" effect [10, 31], moving to another city or country when
their spouse was relocated.

After the COVID-19 pandemic and suddenly working from home,
women reported facing pressure to work extra hours, “having
no boundary set for working hours” (S24), and having to either attend
meetings in different time zones or to learn new knowledge for
the work. They also mentioned the consequences for not giving in
to this pressure: they would be excluded from decisions that are
made during the meetings and are perceived by others as “lacking
in teamwork” (S30).

When working extra and long hours, women feel stressed and
have trouble disconnecting from work, “impacting other household
chores and having hardly any time left to bring some peace to the
mind” (S49). The lack of well-being support causes high levels
of stress, which would be one of the reasons to quit.

Besides the inflexible location, our participants also mentioned
that before the COVID-19 they lacked flexible work hours (which
improved during the pandemic) and paid sick leave (specific for one
location, for which the local laws do not cover this). These points
are really important for those who have parenting and caretaking
responsibilities, though. Lack of daycare in the office was associated
with lack of parental support, which can cause women to leave
the company.

Sexism. The ambivalent sexism theory [27] defines sexism
3.1.2
as a multidimensional construct that includes two sets of attitudes:
hostile and benevolent. Sexism has typically been conceptualized
as a reflection of hostility toward women [27]. Hostile sexism is
related to the classic definition of prejudice [3].

Our participants from our investigation reported microaggres-
sions in which their “voices are suppressed per opposite gender” (S19).
Besides not being heard during technical discussions, women re-
ceive various diminishing comments, such as that women cannot
bring the same results as men and that “women come to work only
for time pass or are not brilliant enough" (S85). Exposure to such
diminishing comments can be a reason to leave.

Benevolent sexism represents the subjectively positive feelings
toward a gender that often bring some sexist antipathy [27]. The par-
ticipants reported being “pampered, never been given a hard/straight
feedback” (S57) and being included in initiatives only because they
are women, not because of their skills and capacity.

3.1.3 Lack of Recognition. Feeling valued or appreciated is part
of Maslow’s hierarchy of human needs [4]. The participants men-
tioned “Not been recognized by her job” (S63) and that women’s
results are usually evaluated as OK, never as excellent (S57),
even when accomplishing exceptional work. No praises from man-
agers was considered one of the reasons to leave.

Lack of Peer Parity. Being surrounded by similar individuals
3.1.4
to which to compare oneself, or identifying with at least one other
peer in the team, is known as peer parity [22].

The participants mentioned an “[im]balance in men:women ratio”
(S37) and two consequences: (i) impact on their social capital, as they
considered it “hard to collaborate socially” (S55), “[be]cause
men socialize in a different way than women do” (S12); and (ii) impact
on developing their self-confidence due to lack of role models,
as they “lack [] strong women leaders as mentors” (S14).

Impostor Syndrome. Impostor Syndrome (also known as im-
3.1.5
postor phenomenon, fraud syndrome, perceived fraudulence, or
impostor experience), describes an experience of individuals who,
despite their objective successes, struggle to internalize their ac-
complishments, feel persistent self-doubt, and being exposed as a
fraud or impostor [16].

Our participants mentioned as a challenge and reason to leave sit-
uations in which women personalize failures and “feel ashamed
and inferior more than men and they tend to escape it by leaving
[the company], but always masked as personal reasons” (S6).

3.1.6 Glass Ceiling. describes a corporate world phenomenon in
which minorities’ access to the top-management positions is blocked
by tradition or culture [37], as an invisible structural barrier that
prevent minorities from career advancement [64].

Two reasons to leave reported by the participants included the
perception of pay ineqality between genders and inferior ca-
reer growth opportunities for women. For the former, S30 stated
that “women employees are paid less compared to male counterparts”,
while for the last, S69 mentioned that she “reach[ed] a stage where
[they] have nowhere to [climb next] in the ladder” (S69). Still, women
reported that they feel that they work harder to achieve the same
positions as men, indicating a possible lack of transparency
about the ladder criteria, as their ambition is discouraged,

and framing you inside a box" (S79).

of a group that does not align with stereotypes is measured at a
stricter standard than those who do align with the stereotypes
and, consequently, has to constantly provide more evidence to
demonstrate competence [7].

The participants mentioned that women need to show com-
petence all the time: “put extra effort to be heard when there is
competition between men” (S84) and having “ no room to slip [up]"
(S41). Lastly, women feel they need to prove themselves when re-
ceiving an important task, [as] they are supervised by another
person to guarantee they do it correctly (S65).

3.1.8 Maternal Wall. describes the experience of mothers whose
coworkers perceive and judge them as having made one of two
choices: either they continue to work and neglect their family, mak-
ing the mother less likable, or the mother prioritizes family over
work, making them less reliable in the workplace [75]. Our par-
ticipants reported that women who are mothers receive [fewer]
responsibilities because they have kids, as they are believed to
not be able to handle much work. One of them reported “surprising
colleagues that [they] are able to handle it all” (S7). In addition, one
of the reasons that cause women to leave is that “when returning
from maternity leave, not enough support is provided or generally
the woman is asked to step down from the role” (S38).

3.1.9 A segmented look at the challenges perceived by women. In
addition to the categorization described above, we took a deeper
look into the results to understand the prevailing reports of chal-
lenges among our respondents and across different demographics.
We avoid using the numerical prevalence of evidence to indicate the
importance or criticality of any challenge. However, when present-
ing the results, we use supplementary and corroborative counting
of the responses to triangulate the qualitative analysis [29]. The
majority of respondents reported challenges related to Work-Life
Balance Issues (54.7%), Glass Ceiling (40.6%), and Sexism (21.9%).
Figure 2 illustrates those three categories of challenges for each
demographic.

We used the most representative demographic subgroup (see
Table 1) to present the percentages, which reflect the number of par-
ticipants who mentioned any difficulties that were classified under
each category of challenge. Most of the respondents who reported
challenges related to work-life balance issues are married and
live in India, with proportions higher than 80%. No demographic
was so prevalent for glass ceiling and sexism, demonstrating that
both challenges were reported by a broader subgroup.

We also calculated the odds ratio for each of the three most
reported challenges, considering the demographics detailed in Sec-
tion 2.3. Table 3 presents the results of the odds ratio for each
category of challenge. According to our sample, women with more
experience in the software industry have higher odds (3.62x) than
those with less experience to report challenges related to work-life
balance issues. The odds that married women report challenges
related to work-life balance issues are 5.08x higher than for
single or divorced women.

When analyzing the intersectionality of the demographics, we
learned that all of the 20 women who have more than 10 years of
experience in the software industry and reported challenges that
were categorized into work-life balance issues are married or
live in a domestic relationship with children. Regarding the glass
ceiling, we also observed that more than the half of the women who
reported this challenge have more than 10 years of experience in
the software industry, are married or live in a domestic relationship,
and live with children.

We found eight categories of challenges, with the most men-
tioned ones categorized into work-life balance issues, glass ceil-
ing, and sexism. Women from our sample with more experience
in the software industry and who were married were more likely
to report challenges related to work-life balance issues.

3.2 RQ2: What are possible actions to mitigate

the identified challenges, from the
women’s perspectives?

We now present the actions recommended by the participants to
help mitigate the challenges and retain more women in the com-
pany. Our analysis revealed six categories that explain the actions
suggested by women, which we present in Fig. 3.

Table 4 presents the number of participants whose responses fit
in each category. Most of the respondents suggested the company
Hire More Women (35.7%), Support Work-Life Balance (30.0%),
and Embrace Eqality (28.6%). We used the most representative
demographic subgroup (see Table 1) to present the percentages,
which reflect the number of participants who mentioned any diffi-
culties that were classified under each category of suggestion. In
the following, we present our findings organized by category.

3.2.1 Embrace Equality. Using the definition provided by UNESCO:
“Gender equality exists when all genders enjoy the same status and
have equal conditions, treatment, and opportunities for realizing
their full potential, human rights and for contributing to and benefit-
ing from economic, social, cultural and political development.” [65].
In terms of cultural improvements, the participants suggested
the company train all managers in soft skills to have more
empathy and avoid burnout in their teams, so they can also
respect and give voice to women.

In terms of process improvements, participants called for more
equality in terms of payment, opportunities, and challenges. Pro-
viding “equal payment between genders” (S28), “equal opportunities
without considering whether it is a women who is applying” (S88),
and “giving [women] equal challenges like [those] given to the male
employees which allow them to venture into more of learning and
become confident” (S54).

Finally, our participants asked to “not allocate women only
in procedural tasks, but include [them] in projects in which they
feel [they are a] part [of the team], responsible and that can challenge
their skills” (S62). This can give them equal opportunities and break
the glass ceiling.

Support Women’s Career Growth. To break the glass ceiling,
3.2.2
the participants mentioned the need to encourage women to
advance in their career, “moving ahead in other streams apart
from people management roles as well and having more women in
technical leadership roles where very few women seem to step in”
(S30).

Mentoring can “help younger talents to identify themselves and
give them confidence and more prospects of continuing their career in
the company” (S65). Prepare women to advance in career laddering
by mentoring by other women who are role models, which can
happen during “programs for women in leadership roles”, “showing
them how to grow, by teaching the skills that will help them get
recognized in the crowd and make her feel valued” (S42).

3.2.3 Hire More Women. To hire more women, our participants
suggested changes to the job opportunities the company offers and
to the recruitment process, and to invest in marketing ˙Regarding

tions included transparency about the required skills, advertising

Figure 3: Strategies suggested by women for the company to increase women in software development teams

job openings to women’s groups and events, and raising awareness
about how the company supports women’s growth. Finally, the sug-
gestions included base-level actions like investing in programs
to attract girls to STEM, and being “active in the social media
that are accessed by the audience (e.g., Snap/Instagram)” (S90) so
they would be “securing more talent women to join” (S38) and “from
a fresher level” (S58).

3.2.4 Promote Women’s Groups and Events. Considering that many
teams still have only a few women, our participants mentioned that
the lack of parity can be mitigated by havingwomen’s support
groups and events for “interaction between women from dif-
ferent departments” (S81). The events were suggested to target
not only women, but “to celebrate differences and diversity (gender,
cultural, age), so that minorities feel more valued” (S40).

3.2.5 Empower Women. Empowerment is a strong strategy to fight
the impostor syndrome [17] and one of the strategies to foster it
is recognition [44]. The study participants recommended recog-
nition and achievements’ rewards. Moreover, since women’s
empowerment refers to enhancement of their power and position
in society, some participants suggested that “sharing the stories of
[the company’s] women can encourage and motivate women em-
ployees in achieving the same” (S49). Morever, empowerment could
be achieved by “publishing women’s success stories in social
media” (S47) and external events.

Support Work-Life Balance. Sabbaticals are paid leaves for
3.2.6
personal and professional development reasons [50] to promote
well-being, and are also beneficial for the company, as they increase
future productivity [18]. The participants suggested to implement
sabbatical policies so they can “take a break from [their] career”
(S2) to rest, dedicate some time to their family, and acquire new
knowledge.

Another suggestion was to “discourage extra hours, as the
workaholics tend to breach the latter, not just their own, but the
team’s too in a collaborative environment” (S43).

Maternity leaves usually relate to each country’s law. Some
countries mandate a long maternity leave, while others mandate a
shorter one [25]. The participants protested that “maternity leaves
should not be considered an impediment for a woman to grow” (S54)

and asked for the company to assist maternity by implementing
own rules to extend the paid leave to 1 year, even “beyond local
laws of the country” (S22).

Participants called for actions to embrace equality and help
reduce the sexist culture inside the company, and to mitigate
the biases that create maternity wall and prove-it-again effects.
Initiatives to support women’s growth were suggested to start
breaking the glass ceiling. Hiring more women and organizing
women’s groups could foster peer parity, and women’s empower-
ment could reduce impostor syndrome and provide recognition.
Sabbaticals and discouraging long work hours were mentioned
as ways to improve the work-life balance.

4 DISCUSSION
In this section, we present a more in-depth discussion of our results
in the context of the literature.
Work-Life Balance Issues faced by mothers. Work and family
are the two most important domains in a person’s life and their in-
terface has been the object of study for researchers worldwide [70].
As women assume the role of working professional in addition to
their traditional role of homemaker, they are under great pressure
to balance their work and personal lives [70]. The societal role
expectations, women’s career ambitions, and the nature of the IT
industry challenges the way women manage their professional and
personal lives [30]. The COVID-19 pandemic and the need to work
from home cast new light on these issues. While it brought more
flexibility to many workers (which is the case of the company stud-
ied), it also brought new challenges [23, 60]. For a great share of the
population, it became hard to separate personal and professional
life. Women felt this more than men, given the aforementioned
societal expectations[43].

Work-life balance is a challenge that happens in and beyond the
IT industry. In Japan, work-life balance is a general challenge, and
the low numbers of women in medicine reflect the societal belief
that careers and motherhood do not mix [61]. In contrast, Scandi-
navia has similar numbers of men and women physicians, which
has coincided with the emergence of progressive work–life policies,

the belief that women can combine motherhood and employment,
and changing expectations of work-life balance. This shows that it
is possible and that the mindset in the software industry needs to
change.

The lack of parent support is one of the major challenges that
Indian companies within the IT sector have been trying to navigate
over the past decade to ensure a gender inclusive workplace [59].
This is reinforced by our work,in which women provided sugges-
tions on how to improve parental policies to support families
and mitigate this challenge, as we showed is Section 3.2. Sponsor-
ing child care, preferentially in the office and specially for young
children, providing adequate maternity leave beyond the relevant
country’s laws, and also providing more flexibility in work hours
and location were some of the suggestions for the company to take
in order to mitigate the challenges of work-life balance issues re-
lated to motherhood. This is harder to implement in many cases due
to the countries’ legislation and the local culture, which influence
how organizational policies are defined.

Prepare women to break the glass ceiling. Analogous to the
IT industry, women’s barriers in the medical profession and their
ability to rise to leadership positions are also influenced by social
and cultural context [61]. Similar to software teams, where women
are instrumental to reducing community smells [15], in interna-
tional relations the collaboration between women delegates and
women civil society groups positively impacts and brings more
durable peace when negotiating peace agreements [39]. By analyz-
ing the career trajectories of women executives across a variety of
sectors, Glass and Cook [26] concluded that while attaining promo-
tion to leadership is not easy, serving in a high position can be even
more challenging. Although women can be more likely than men
to be empowered to high-risk leadership positions, they often lack
the support or authority to accomplish their strategic goals. As a
result, women leaders often experience shorter tenures compared
to their peers who are men [26].

The respondents provided suggestions to support their career
growth to mitigate this challenge, including having women to
inspire, encourage and mentor other women, as we showed is Sec-
tion 3.2. Providing training for mentors on topics such as speaking
up on behalf of women who are being disrespected in meetings,
managing bias in the workplace, and raising awareness of micro-
aggressions at work are some examples of what should be included
as part of standard training and preparation for mentors [24]. The
mentoring program can start by having a different woman leader
each month discuss her career trajectory and the benefits and chal-
lenges of holding her job. Women could share their techniques
for managing time, balancing family and career demands, mak-
ing themselves heard by men, and highlighting how they learn
new skills on a regular basis [79]. Besides joining ongoing support
groups, women can be assigned to formal mentors for one-on-one
regular meetings [38].

Combining synergistic suggestions. One option for compa-
nies looking to improve women’s participation is to combine strate-
gies that are synergistic. The company can start by implementing
simple, but structured actions combining ideas from more than one
strategy. For example, by publishing success stories of women on
media, the company can empower women and also attract and hire
more women. Another action that combines synergistic strategies

is to arrange women-only groups and analyze messages to imple-
ment feasible changes to problems that are being actively discussed
and could potentially cause women to leave, as when women report
facing hostile sexism. The literature reports that women experi-
ence computing environments differently due to sexism and racism,
both historically and as part of the current culture [6, 45, 46, 69],
potentially leading them to feel unwelcome and lacking of sense of
belonging [63], and ultimately to leave [21].

Some problems come from beyond the company gates. Even
in a company like Ericsson, which cares about Diversity & Inclusion,
“untying the mooring ropes" of socio-cultural problems is difficult.
Historically, the social differences influenced by gender roles (i.e.,
the roles that men and women are expected to occupy based on
their sex) may be amplified because of the gendered division of
housework and child care tasks, especially for mothers of young
children. Impostor syndrome [5, 42, 78], Sexism [12, 14, 53, 67],
Lack of Peer Parity [13, 56], Prove-it-Again [36], Glass Ceiling [14]
and Work-Life Balance issues [42, 43] were challenges reported by
women from the present study and also reported by both women in
other software development contexts and in F/OSS. Some problems
surpass the organization and are related to the local culture of the
employees and managers. There are problems that go beyond the
company’s gates and bump into the society, which many times
contributes to this cultural legacy. One example is the “trailing
spouse", when a person who follows his or her life partner to an-
other city because of a work assignment [10, 31]. Moreover, during
the COVID-19 pandemic, a longer “double-shift” of paid and unpaid
work in a context of school closures and limited availability of care
services have contributed to an overall increase in stress, anxiety
around job insecurity, and difficulty in maintaining work-life bal-
ance among women with children [1]. However, there is also space
for improvement in the organization, and Ericsson is committed
to implementing the suggested changes to mitigate the challenges
faced by its women employees.

4.1 Implications to the company
We presented the results to the managers of the studied suborga-
nization and to the managers of Human Resources department.
The feedback was very positive regarding the usefulness of the
research. Managers considered the results helpful for the company
to understand the current situation and to decide about actions can
mitigate the challenges that women currently face and avoid them
leaving the company. For the suggestions that are already in place,
such as publishing successful stories of women and support groups,
the company plans to expand and raise awareness to the employees.
Sexism is considered an unacceptable behavior to Ericsson. The
managers of the studied suborganization already started to have
collective meetings with the team to spread the message and remind
that sexism is not tolerated by the company. Following, the com-
pany is planning recurrent meetings to plan strategies that address
the suggestions provided by the participants. In addition, Ericsson
plans to raise awareness about the solutions that already exist (and
maybe women are not aware of) and additional actions that can
complement the suggestions to mitigate the reported challenges.

5 RELATED WORK
Although diversity is a multidimensional concept that refers to the
variety of representations that exist within a group [2, 76], gender
(with a focus on women), is the most explored aspect of diversity in
software engineering literature [47, 66]. The prevalence of gender
as the most studied diversity aspect can be explained by the fact
that the technology professions are known to be male dominated,
despite the fact that programming was originally seen as a female
occupation [8, 9, 20, 34]. According to a longitudinal study that
evaluated 50 years of data and the evolution of code contributions
since 1970, Zacchiroli [81] showed that woman developers’ con-
tributions remain low when compared to those of men. Although
the study found that men have always authored more open source
code than women, the gap has begun to narrow and women are
slowly gaining space.

The biases and challenges faced by women in software develop-
ment teams have been investigated in different industry cases [14,
52, 54, 78]. The Finish women from Wolff et al. [78]’s study reported
lack of self-efficacy, which is a possible predecessor of impostor
syndrome, also found in our study. Also similar to our results, the
Brazilian women from Canedo et al. [14]’s study also reported hos-
tile sexism, including discrimination and bias, and benevolent
sexism, when women do not receive the more complex tasks, and
glass ceiling, as only few women perform a leadership role in their
team. Another study with Brazilian women during the COVID-19
pandemic [43] revealed that women faced even more work-life
balance issues, lacking support with housework and child care re-
sponsibilities. As opposed to the glass ceiling reported by Canedo
et al. [14]’s study and our results, the main challenge reported
by the Zimbabwean women from [52]’s study was lack of digital
exposure and career guidance from young age. So far, the studies
point at generic aspects, focusing on understanding a broader, more
comprehensive picture of the challenges faced by women. In our
work, we evolve the findings by diagnosing an organization that is
investing in programs to attract and retain women.

Women who contribute to F/OSS projects have reported some
of the challenges also reported by women from the present study:
work-life balance issues [42], impostor syndrome [5, 42], lack of
peer parity [13, 56], prove-it-again [36] and sexism [12, 53, 67].
Non-inclusive communication is faced by F/OSS women in code
reviews and mailing lists [5, 55, 58], and was reported as an as-
pect of the hostile sexism faced by women in the present study,
which they described taking place during meetings. While in F/OSS
women face bias against contributions when they explicitly iden-
tify as women[13, 71], in our study we found a lack of recognition.
Stereotypes manifest the common expectations about members
of certain social groups. Both the descriptive (how women are)
and prescriptive (how women should be) gender stereotypes and
the expectations they produce can compromise a woman’s career
progress [32, 33]. In F/OSS projects, women reported facing stereo-
typing that box them into specializations despite their manifest
protest [74] and being treated by men as if they were their mothers,
asking for advice about how to dress and behave but refusing to
enter into a technical dialogue [53]. While women in our study
reported also facing stereotypes, for them it was part of the Ma-
ternity Wall and receiving fewer responsibilities because they

had children. And whereas F/OSS women reported that they faced
obstacles to finding a mentor, since upon discovering their mentee’s
gender, men mentors can treat the relationship as a dating opportu-
nity [53], this was not reported by women from the present study.

6 THREATS TO VALIDITY
There are some limitations related to our research results.

Internal validity. The characteristics of our sample may have
influenced our results. Although the company has office in several
locations, a great part of the responses (42 out of 64) were from
women who live in India. Thus, the challenges and suggestions can
reflect some of the specific socio-cultural problems and aspirations
for women from this country. The most prevalent nationality of
employees overall from the studied suborganization is Indian (55%).
External Validity. The results are valid for the studied sub-
organization of Ericsson and additional research is necessary to
investigate the challenges and suggestions in other contexts.

Survival bias. Our results reflect the opinion of current em-
ployees. Therefore, to increase women’s participation by fully un-
derstanding the reasons they might leave, we acknowledge that
additional research is necessary to understand the point of view of
the women who left the company. To mitigate this threat, we asked
the participants about reasons that prompted a woman they know
to leave the company.

Recall bias. As our questions were open-ended, our results
could be impacted by either salience bias, where respondents focus
on definitions that are prominent or emotionally striking and not
necessarily all the factors that matter; or by memory bias, where
participants answered questions based on what they can first recall.
However, topics that are relevant to the respondent often emerge
from the spontaneous answers.

Data Consistency. Consistency refers to ensuring that the re-
sults consistently follow from the data and there is no inference
that cannot be supported after data analysis [48]. The group of
researchers performed the qualitative analysis of questionnaire’s
responses. We had weekly meetings to discuss and adjust codes
and categories until reaching agreement. In the meetings, we also
checked the consistency of our interpretations. All analysis was
thoroughly grounded in the data collected and exhaustively dis-
cussed amongst the whole team. The team includes researchers
with extensive experience in qualitative methods.

Theoretical saturation. A potential limitation in qualitative
studies regards reaching theoretical saturation. From participants
in this study with different backgrounds and perceptions about the
studied phenomenon, we received 64 responses for the challenges
question and 70 for the strategies. The participants were diverse in
terms of experience, tenure, age, family status. Therefore, although
theoretical saturation cannot be claimed, we believe that we ob-
tained a consistent and comprehensive account of the phenomenon
for the studied case. After analyzing the 40𝑡ℎ response of challenge
and the 29𝑡ℎ response of suggestion we did not find any new cate-
gories, using the existing categories for the following 24 challenges
and 41 suggestions.

ICSE-SEIS’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

7 CONCLUSION
This paper presents a case study aiming at understanding the chal-
lenges faced by women in a large software company and collecting
strategies to increase the number of women. We found that even
with the commitment with diversity and inclusion from Ericsson,
women still perceive challenges and call for changes.

We also showed that the cultural structural sexism present in
society is mirrored in the professional environment. There is still
a long work ahead for Ericsson, for the software industry, and for
us, as society, to create a more diverse and inclusive environment.
We hope our results will enlighten actions towards reducing the
perceived challenges and (more importantly, maybe) increasing
awareness about the structural and cultural hurdles imposed on
women that negatively influence diversity in the software industry.
