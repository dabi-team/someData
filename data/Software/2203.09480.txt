Abstract 
Heating and cooling load calculation based on dynamic models is widely used in simulation 
software and it is the method recommended by ASHRAE and CEN. The principle is to make 
the heat balance for the air volume of a room space considered at uniform temperature and to 
calculate  from  this  equation  the  load,  i.e.  the  power  needed  to  obtain  the  required  indoor 
temperature. The problem is that, by doing so, the physical causality is not respected. If the 
model is approximated by a piecewise linear dynamical system, this procedure results in an 
improper transfer function. In order to point out this problem, a method to obtain state space 
and transfer function models from thermal networks is introduced. Then, the transfer function 
representation is employed to show that changing the physical causality results in an improper 
transfer  function.  The  practical  consequence  is  that  when  the  space  temperature  has  a  step 
variation, the calculated load tends to infinity if the simulation time step tends to zero. The issue 
of causality may be a problem in equation-based simulation software, such as MODELICA, in 
which  the  equations  do  not  represent  causal  relations:  a  wrong  choice  of  the  causality  in  a 
balance equation may result in improper transfer functions.

Introduction 

Estimating  the  heating  or  cooling  load  means  to  find  out  what  is  the  power  needed  by  the 
building in order to maintain the indoor temperature at a desired value when the heat gains and 
losses (due to weather, ventilation rates, occupancy, usage of electrical appliances, etc.) vary. 
Thermal load calculation is one of the most important tasks of building design. It is used to 
improve the architectural design by estimating the energy performance of buildings, to size the 
heating,  cooling  and  ventilation  systems,  to  conceive  the  control  strategies  for  lowering  the 
peak demand and the energy consumption, to analyze the life cycle cost. Thermal simulation of 
buildings  by  employing  the  heating  and  cooling  load  is  used  to  check  if  a  building  design 
complies with standards and regulations. 

It  is  generally  accepted  that  the  heat  balance  method  is  fundamental  for  the  thermal  load 
calculation. Other procedures are seen as variants or simplifications of this method. Therefore, 
heat  balance  method  is  used  by  simulation  software  such  as  TRNSYS  (TRNSYS  2007), 
EnergyPlus  (EnergyPlus  2012),  ESP-r  (Clarke  2001),  CLIMA  (Skeiker  2010),  etc.  It  is  the 
recommended method of ASHRAE (Bellenger et al. 2001) and the basis of the CEN standard 
for  calculation  of  the  design  heat  load  (CEN  2003)  as  well  as  of  other  standards  related  to 
thermal performances of buildings (e.g. CEN 2007a, CEN 2007b). 

The principle of the method is to do the heat balance on the air volume of the room. This implies 
calculating the conductive, convective and radiative heat balance for each surface of the room 
and the convective heat balance for the room air (e.g. Wang and Chen 2000, Bellenger et al. 
2001, Hernandez et al. 2003, Xu and Wang 2008, Li et al. 2009).  

The result of the heat balance is an input-output model. A dynamical input-output system is 
causal when its output depends only on past inputs and noncausal if its output depends also on 
future  inputs.  All  physical  systems  need  to  be  causal  (Romagnoli  and  Palazoglu  2012).  An 
acausal system is not physically realizable because it requires prediction (Morari and Zafiriou 
1989).  

When used for calculating the indoor temperature, the heat balance method is a direct method 
(i.e. it respects the physical causality): the output, i.e. the indoor temperature, depends on more 
inputs,  including  the  thermal  load.  However,  when  it  is  used  to  estimate  the  load,  the  heat 
balance  method,  in  its  actual  form,  results  in  an  acausal  system:  the  output  of  the  physical 
system,  i.e.  the  indoor  temperature,  becomes  an  input  of  the  algorithm  for  calculating  the 
thermal load. The practical consequence of the acausality is that, if the indoor room temperature 
has a step variation, the calculated load tends to infinity when the time step for calculation tends 
to zero. Mathematically, if the thermal model is linear (or piece-wise linearized for one or more 
time steps during the simulation), it is characterized by an improper transfer function which 
grows  unbounded  as  the  frequency  approaches  infinity.  Practically,  when  the  indoor 
temperature varies, the value of the calculated thermal load will depend on the value of the time 
step used in simulation. The physical explanation is rather intuitive: an infinite power is needed 
to change the indoor temperature instantaneously. Therefore, the sizing of the HVAC system, 
which is determined by the calculated load, will depend on the time step used in simulation. 
Practitioners noticed this problem and introduced load limitations in the heat balance method 
(e.g. CEN 2007b). 

The way in which the heat balance method for load calculation is usually presented makes it 
difficult to notice that the model used for estimating the load results in an improper transfer

function that does not respect the causality. However, if the whole system of equations is written 
in state space form and then transformed into a set of transfer functions, it becomes evident that 
some transfer functions are improper, which reflects their acausality. 

2  Principle of the heat balance method 

The most important assumption of the heat balance (HB) method is that the temperature of the 
air in the thermal zone is homogeneous. The other important assumptions are that the surfaces 
(walls, windows, floors, ceilings, etc.) have uniform temperature, uniform long-wave and short-
wave irradiation and diffuse radiation (Bellenger et al. 2001). The heat conduction is usually 
treated  in  one  dimension  but  two  or  three  dimensions  may  be  handled.  Based  on  these 
assumptions, heat balance is done for each wall for outside face, nodes in the solid walls and 
inside face. Finally, the convective heat balance is done for the room air (Figure 1):

Finding the load 
for heat transfer is linear (or piecewise linear), than equations (3) or (4) result in an improper 
transfer function. In order to demonstrate this, we will first obtain a state space formulation of 
the thermal model. Then, from the state space form we will obtain the transfer functions and 
we will demonstrate that equations (3) or (4) end in an improper transfer function. A simple 
numerical  example,  which  does  not  reduce  the  generality  of  the  problem,  will  be  used  to 
illustrate these steps. 

3  Differential algebraic equation representation of the thermal model 

The thermal model of the room is described by a system of differential algebraic equations.  In 
order to obtain this system, an algorithm is proposed which is inspired by Strang (1986, 2009),

frequently used in electrical circuits modeling and analysis. As compared to electrical circuits, 
the thermal circuits do not have an element equivalent to inductance. Thermal circuits may be 
arranged in branches, containing thermal resistances and temperature sources, and nodes, to 
which thermal capacities and flow sources are connected.

6  Transfer function model in the case of non-negligible thermal capacity of the 

indoor air  

We will consider a thermal network (Figure 3 a) that is an epitome of the heat balance method 
(Figure 1). Since the aim is to present the principle, the model from Figure 3 keeps the essential 
aspects of the heat balance method at a minimum number of temperature nodes. Normally, the 
wall would consist of several layers, each layer discretized in order to obtain temperatures at 
several nodes inside it. Generally, different surfaces would be considered for the room walls, 
windows, doors, floors, ceilings, etc. Thermal bridges can be also included in the model by 
treating heat conduction in two and three dimensions. But the simplicity of the model shown in 
Figure 3 does not reduce its generality for the problem presented hereafter.  

Any thermal network can be easily put to comply with the typical branch and node shown in 
Figure 2. For example, the thermal network of Figure 3b is the equivalent of the network

As in the case of non-negligible thermal capacity of the room air, the heat balance equation (2), 
which is one of the equations from the system of equations (39), was used to obtain the output

. However, the relation between equation (2) and equation (62) is not self-evident. 

8  Transfer function for the thermal load 

In order to obtain the thermal load, the current method uses equation (3) or (4). By using the 
transfer functions, this is equivalent to express 

 from equation (57) or (62):

It results that this method yields an improper function for input

9  Consequences of the improper transfer function 

The models of multiple input – multiple output systems (MIMO) describe a causal relation from 
input to the output if and only if the transfer matrix is proper, i.e. if in any entry of the transfer 
matrix  the  degree  of  the  denominator  is  larger  than  or  equal  to  the  degree  of  the  numerator  
(Mareels and Polderman 1996). A system with an improper transfer matrix is not physically 
realizable because it requires prediction (Morari and Zafirou 1989). Furthermore, an improper 
transfer function amplifies the high frequencies.

Heat balance method for load calculation results in an improper transfer function. The practical 
consequence is that this method cannot be used to calculate the load, 
, when the space 
, varies. For example, if the air space temperature has a step change (which is 
temperature, 
  will  be 
frequently  the  case  in  simulations),  the  high  frequencies  present  in  the  signal  of 
amplified. If the simulation time step tends to zero, the calculated load will tend to infinity, 
which technologically is obviously not achievable. One solution is to limit the value of the load 
(CEN 2007b), which implies that the simulation will not be used to calculate the maximum 
load;  however,  it  can  be  useful  for  energy  consumption  estimation.  Another  solution  is  to 
introduce a term in the transfer function of 
 in order to make it proper. This is achievable by 
considering the thermal inertia of the HVAC system or by introducing a feed-back control loop, 
in  which  case  the  maximum  load  depends  on  the  controller  type  and  settings  (Ghiaus  and 
Hazyuk 2010).

10  Conclusions 

Heat balance method used for simulation of the time variation of the air space temperature as a 
function of inputs has strong physical basis. The most restrictive assumption is that the air in 
the thermal zone has a uniform temperature. The heat balance results in a set of differential 
algebraic equations which, after piece-wise linearization, can be written in state space form and 
then transformed in a set of transfer functions. These models respect the causality: the outputs 
depend on inputs through the state variables. Consequently, the transfer functions are proper. 

Thermal load calculation is an inverse problem. One input of the physical system, the thermal 
load,  becomes  an  output  of  the  model  and  one  output  of  the  physical  system,  the  indoor 
temperature, becomes an input of the model used in calculation. The method used to solve this 
problem does not respect the causality and results in an improper transfer function. Therefore, 
the  high  frequencies  present  in  the  signal  of  the  indoor  temperature  will  be  amplified.  The 
practical consequence is that, if the indoor temperature varies, the calculated load will depend 
on  the  simulation  time  step:  smaller  the  time  step,  larger  the  calculated  load.  If  the  room 
temperature has a step variation, the calculated load will tend to infinity when the simulation 
step tends to zero. This effect is less evident if the simulation time step is one hour (the usual 
value in building simulation software) but becomes evident if the time step is reduced. 

The problem of non causality can be solved by introducing a filter which will make the transfer 
function  proper.  This  can  be  achieved  by  transforming  the  load  calculation  into  a  control 
problem. Then, the load will be the output of the control algorithm. 

The  issue  of  causality  is  not  self-evident  for  complex  systems.  Therefore,  the  claim  of 
simulation systems which are equation-based (i.e. in which the equations describe equalities, 
not assignments) that there is a benefit in the ability to choose arbitrarily the inputs and the 
outputs of the model (Modelica 2000, Dymola 2004) is questionable if this choice results in 
improper transfer functions.
