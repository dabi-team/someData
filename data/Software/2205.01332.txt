Abstract: We propose a virtual clinical trial for assessing the safety and eﬃcacy of closed-loop
diabetes treatments prior to an actual clinical trial. Such virtual trials enable rapid and risk-free
pretrial testing of algorithms, and they can be used to compare diﬀerent treatment variations
for large and diverse populations. The participants are represented by multiple mathematical
models, consisting of stochastic diﬀerential equations, and we use Monte Carlo closed-loop
simulations to compute detailed statistics of the closed-loop treatments. We implement the
virtual clinical trial using high-performance software and hardware, and we present an example
trial with two mathematical models of one million participants over 52 weeks (i.e., two million
simulations), which can be completed in 2 h 9 min.

1. INTRODUCTION

Clinical trials ensure the safety and eﬃcacy of medical
treatments, but they are also time-consuming and ex-
pensive. Furthermore, they might result in a negative
outcome, e.g., that the proposed treatment is not safe.
Therefore, prior to the actual clinical trial, it is impor-
tant to 1) evaluate the potential treatment performance,
2) identify shortcomings and risks, and 3) assess the advan-
tages of the treatment over alternative treatments. This is
the purpose of virtual clinical trials which involve virtual
participants that are represented by a mathematical model
(often consisting of diﬀerential equations). By using high-
performance computing (HPC) software and hardware,
such virtual trials can involve large populations and long-
term protocols, which allows for extensive and fast testing
of diﬀerent treatment variations.

In this paper, we consider virtual clinical trials of closed-
loop diabetes treatment systems. These are also referred
to as artiﬁcial pancreases (APs). Worldwide, one in ten
adults suﬀer from diabetes, and according to the Inter-
national Diabetes Federation (2021), it accounted for 9%
of the 2021 global health expenditure (USD 966 billion).
Speciﬁcally, we consider type 1 diabetes (T1D) where, due
to autoimmune destruction of the β-cells, the pancreas
does not produce any insulin. People with T1D require
daily treatment with exogenous insulin in order to avoid
high blood glucose concentrations (hyperglycemia). Pro-
longed hyperglycemia can lead to a number of health
complications and chronic conditions, e.g., chronic kidney
disease, cardiovascular disease, and damage to the eyes and
nerves. Conversely, the insulin treatment can lead to low

ADAPT-T2D (9068-00056B).

blood glucose concentrations (hypoglycemia), which can
result in acute complications such as loss of consciousness
and seizures.

Clearly, given the risks associated with hyper- and hypo-
glycemia, it is not straightforward for people with T1D
to manage their insulin treatment. Therefore, over the
last few decades, there have been signiﬁcant developments
within AP systems which can decrease this burden (Lal
et al., 2019). APs typically consist of 1) a continuous
glucose monitor (CGM), 2) an insulin pump, and 3) a
control algorithm implemented on a smartphone or a ded-
icated device. The control algorithm repeatedly computes
an appropriate insulin ﬂow rate based on measurements
from the CGM device and communicates it to the insulin
pump. There exist a variety of control algorithms for
computing the insulin ﬂow rate, e.g., based on heuristics,
fuzzy logic, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) con-
trol (Huyett et al., 2015; Sejersen et al., 2021), and model
predictive control (MPC) (Boiroux and Jørgensen, 2018;
Chakrabarty et al., 2020). All of these algorithms contain
algorithmic parameters which must be tuned based on sim-
ulation, i.e., based on a virtual clinical trial. As the human
physiology and behavior vary signiﬁcantly between people
and over time, this is a nontrivial task. In spite of this,
the tuning is typically based on short-term simulations of
one or a few virtual participants who are only represented
by a single mathematical model. In contrast, if large-scale
long-term virtual clinical trials (involving multiple mathe-
matical models) are used to identify candidate algorithms
and algorithmic parameters, the chances of a successful
real-world clinical trial increase signiﬁcantly.

In this work, we develop an approach for performing large-
scale long-term virtual clinical trials of AP algorithms (i.e.,

 
 
 
 
 
 
Monte Carlo closed-loop simulations). The approach is
an extension of our recent work (Reenberg et al., 2022;
Wahlgreen et al., 2021) which allows the virtual partici-
pants to be represented by multiple mathematical models.
Speciﬁcally, we use 1) the model described by Hovorka
et al. (2002) combined with a CGM model and 2) a
modiﬁcation of the model described by Dalla Man et al.
(2007) and Colmegna et al. (2020). Furthermore, we ex-
tend both models to incorporate uncertainty about the
physiology and the CGM measurements, i.e., we formu-
late the models as stochastic diﬀerential equations (de-
scribing the dynamics) and stochastic algebraic equations
(describing the CGM measurements). We implement the
approach using high-performance C code, and we use an
HPC cluster (DTU Computing Center, 2021) to carry out
the computations. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of
the virtual clinical trial by comparing the performance
of an AP algorithm for the two models. Speciﬁcally, we
simulate one million participants over 52 weeks with both
models (i.e., two million in total) which takes 2 h 9 min.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In
Section 2, we describe the virtual clinical trial, and in
Section 3, we describe the two models used in this work.
Next, we present the results of the virtual clinical trial in
Section 4, and ﬁnally, we present conclusions in Section 5.

2. VIRTUAL CLINICAL TRIAL

The virtual clinical trial involves a population of people
with T1D, a protocol describing, e.g., the size and duration
of meals, mathematical models, model parameter values,
and AP algorithms. Additionally, meals and other activi-
ties can be incorrectly announced to the AP algorithm (as
is often the case in reality). Furthermore, the mathematical
models can be either deterministic (no uncertainty) or
stochastic (uncertain dynamics and measurements). The
uncertainty can, for instance, represent physiological phe-
nomena that are not included in the model or unknown
model parameters.

2.1 Virtual people

The virtual clinical trial contains one million virtual peo-
ple. Each person is represented by the same pieces of
information as real people, e.g., a unique ID, given name,
family name, date of birth, place of birth, sex, height, and
body weight. Additionally, each person is associated with
a set of mathematical models and model parameter values.

2.2 Protocols

A protocol describes the participants’ activities during
the virtual trial. Typical examples include the time and
carbohydrate contents of meals as well as the duration and
intensity of physical activity. Furthermore, each protocol
has its own ID, and it contains IDs, time stamps (start
and end time), and type and size for each activity.

In Section 4, we demonstrate the virtual clinical trial using
a protocol based on a Northern European lifestyle with
respect to 1) meal times, 2) work weeks, 3) vacation weeks,
4) public holidays, and 5) seasons. The year is divided
into 4 seasons consisting of 13 weeks. In total, there are

hydrate contents (Reenberg et al., 2022).

8 weeks of vacation (2 of them represent public holidays).
All weeks are either a standard week, an active week,
or a vacation week. Similarly, all days are categorized
as either a standard day, an active day, a day with a
movie night, or a day with a late night. Each type of
week contains a diﬀerent combination of the days, and
each season contains a diﬀerent combination of the weeks.
Table 1 gives an overview of the weeks and seasons as
well as the carbohydrate contents of the diﬀerent meals in
the trial. During autumn, winter, and vacation weeks, the
participants are less active and eat more. Furthermore, in
addition to the meals consumed during a standard day,
active days have an additional exercise session, days with
a movie night have an additional snack in the evening, and
days with a late night have two additional snacks in the
evening.

The virtual participants, model parameters, protocols,
and results from the virtual clinical trial are stored in
a database. We use PostgreSQL which is an open-source
database system. The database enables direct comparison
of the performance of diﬀerent AP systems on diﬀer-
ent populations, e.g., people with high body weights or
low insulin sensitivity (provided that this sensitivity is
a model parameter). Additionally, the database contains
basic components for building protocols, e.g., the 4 types
of days used in the protocol described in Section 2.2. The
user can construct their own protocols based on these basic
components. Finally, the database can be used together
with a graphical user interface to select and visualize
the results of the virtual clinical trial, show statistics of
certain demographics and protocols, and add new elements
(for instance, virtual people, mathematical models and
parameters, or protocols).

3. MODELS

In this section, we describe the two models used in the
virtual clinical trial. In Section 3.1, we describe the model
developed by Hovorka et al. (2002) combined with a
CGM model, and in Section 3.2, we describe the model
developed by Dalla Man et al. (2007) and Colmegna
et al. (2020) where the meal model is replaced with that
proposed by Hovorka et al. (2002). In order to simplify the
demonstration of the virtual clinical trial in Section 4, we
do not include exercise in the models or in the protocol.

insulin-dependent glucose utilization, E [(mg/kg)/min]
represents renal excretion, k1 and k2 [1/min] are rate
parameters, G [mg/dL] is the glucose concentration, and
Vg [dL/kg] is the glucose distribution volume. Next, the
insulin subsystem is represented by

˙I(cid:96)(t) = −(m1 + m3)I(cid:96)(t) + m2Ip(t),
˙Ip(t) = −(m2 + m4)Ip(t) + m1I(cid:96)(t) + RaIsc(t),

liver glucose eﬀectiveness and the amplitude of the insulin
action of the liver, Id and I1 [pmol/L] constitute a two-

sulin kinetics, and uI [pmol/min] is the insulin infusion
rate. Finally, the subcutaneous glucose concentration, Gsc
[mg/dL], is

˙Gsc(t) = −kscGsc(t) + kscG(t),

(16)

and ksc [1/min] is the inverse of a time constant.

3.3 General mathematical form and simulation

The two models described in this section are in the form
(17a)

x(t0) = x0,
dx(t) = f (t, x(t), u(t), d(t), p)dt

+ σ(t, x(t), u(t), d(t), p)dw(t),

z(t) = h(t, x(t), p),
y(tk) = g(tk, x(tk), p) + v(tk).

(17b)
(17c)
(17d)
Here, t is time, t0 is the initial time, x are the states (i.e.,
the physiological state), x0 are the initial states, u are
manipulated inputs computed by the AP algorithm (e.g.,
the insulin infusion rate), d are disturbance variables (e.g.,
the meal carbohydrate content), and p are model param-
eters (speciﬁc to each person). The ﬁrst term in (17b)
is the deterministic (drift) term, and the second term is
the stochastic (diﬀusion) term. At time tk (e.g., every
5 min), the AP receives a CGM measurement, y, which
is corrupted by noise, v. Furthermore, the outputs, z,
are used to evaluate the AP algorithm. The measurement
noise is normally distributed, and w is a standard Wiener
process,
i.e., v(tk) ∼ N (0, R) and dw(t) ∼ N (0, Idt)
where I is an identity matrix. In between measurements,
the manipulated inputs and the disturbance variables are
modeled as constant:
u(t) = uk,
d(t) = dk,

(18a)
(18b)
Finally, when the AP algorithm (represented by the func-
tions κk and λk) receives a measurement, it updates its
internal state, xc
k, and computes the manipulated inputs
based on the measurement, yk = y(tk), the targets ¯uk and
¯yk, an estimate of the disturbance variables, ˆdk, and the
hyperparameters pκ and pµ:
k+1 = κk(xc
xc
uk = λk(xc

k, yk, ¯uk, ¯yk, ˆdk, pκ),
k, yk, ¯uk, ¯yk, ˆdk, pµ).

t ∈ [tk, tk+1[,
t ∈ [tk, tk+1[.

(19b)

(19a)

In Section 3.1 and 3.2, we described the models with-
out uncertainty, i.e., with σ = 0. In Section 4, we use
uncertain models where we 1) add a stochastic term to
the plasma glucose compartments (4a) and (7a) with
(equivalent) diﬀusion coeﬃcients of 1.5 mmol/min3/2 and
270.24/BW mg/(kg min3/2), and 2) add measurement
noise with a variance of 0.1 mmol/L ≈ 1.8 mg/dL.

We use the Euler-Maruyama method with a step size of
0.5 min to simulate each participant, and we only store
statistics (and not individual simulations). We implement

the virtual clinical trial using parallel high-performance C
code for shared-memory architectures and two 2.9 GHz
AMD EPYC 7542 32-core processors.

4. VIRTUAL CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS

In this section, we demonstrate how the virtual clinical
trial can be used to assess the safety and eﬃcacy of an AP
algorithm. We use the protocol described in Section 2, and
for each model, we include one million participants. In the
analysis, we consider the ﬁrst 4 weeks a titration period
and disregard them. In the following, we refer to the model
presented in Section 3.1 as model A and the one presented
in Section 3.2 as model B. We choose the algorithmic
hyperparameters based on deterministic simulations with
model A. The total computation time is 2 h 9 min.

We demonstrate the virtual clinical trial using a simple
algorithm based on physiological insight and concepts from
proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. It uses two
integrators (I-controllers) to estimate the basal and bo-
lus insulin requirements, and a PD-controller to miti-
gate smaller variations in the blood glucose. It also uses
deadbands, error truncation, a hypoglycemia ampliﬁcation
factor, switching logic, as well as a few heuristics. Fig. 2
shows how the controller doses insulin during 4 days of the
virtual clinical trial for a single participant.

We evaluate the algorithm using the performance mea-
sures and targets described by Holt et al. (2021). The
measures are 1) average glucose, 2) glucose management
index (GMI), 3) glucose variation (GV) computed as the
coeﬃcient of variation, 3) time above range (TAR), 4) time
in range (TIR), and 5) time below range (TBR). All of
these are based on CGM measurements. The 5 ranges
used to compute TAR, TIR, and TBR are as follows (all
values are in mmol/L, and the colors are used throughout
this section). Level 2 hypoglycemia: [0, 3[ (red). Level 1
hypoglycemia: [3, 3.9[ (light red). Normoglycemia: [3.9, 10]
(green). Level 1 hyperglycemia, ]10, 13.9] (yellow). Level 2
hyperglycemia: ]13.9, ∞[ (orange).

For model A, τIG has the same value for all partici-
pants. All other parameters are sampled from normal
distributions based on the sample means and variances of
the parameter values presented by Hovorka et al. (2002).
For model B, we generate normal distributions based on
the means and variances reported by Colmegna et al.
(2020). For the remaining parameters, we use the means
and variances of the values reported by Kovatchev et al.
(2010) and Dalla Man et al. (2007). In both cases, we dis-
card parameter sets that deviate more than one standard
deviation from the mean or lead to a basal rate lower
than 0.4 U/h (corresponding to a glucose concentration
of 6 mmol/L). For model A, we also require that all time
constants (including the inverses of rate parameters) are
within one order of magnitude of the mean.

Fig. 3 shows the mean and worst-case (i.e., the participant
with the lowest CGM measurement) time in ranges (TIRs)
as well as a box plot of the distributions of the TIRs. The
mean TIRs are remarkably similar for the two models. The
TIRs of the worst-case participants can be used to iden-
tify shortcomings. Here, the two worst-case participants
appear to be problematic for diﬀerent reasons. The box

model B, the participants get less basal insulin but almost
the same amount of bolus insulin. Fig. 5 shows the cu-
mulative distributions of the CGM measurements. It also
indicates that the worst-case participants are qualitatively
diﬀerent. Finally, Table 2 shows that the AP performs
better for model B. Presumably, the fact that the AP
was tuned for model A is outweighed by the (seemingly)
smaller variations between the participants for model B,
which could be due to the parameter distributions.

5. CONCLUSIONS

We present an approach for conducting large-scale long-
term virtual clinical trials for evaluating APs prior to
the actual clinical trials. The participants are represented
by multiple mathematical models consisting of stochastic
diﬀerential equations. We use Monte Carlo closed-loop
simulations, implemented with HPC software and hard-
ware, to compute detailed treatment statistics. Finally, we
present results from a virtual clinical trial with one million
participants (represented by two mathematical models)
over 52 weeks, which is conducted in 2 h 9 min.
