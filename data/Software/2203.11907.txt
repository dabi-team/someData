“Participatory Educational Research (PER)” journal is one of the journals 
that  contributes  to  the  field  of  education  and  indexed  in  major 
international databases such as ERIC and Scopus. This study provides the 
bibliometric  characteristic  of  the  total  347  articles  published  in  PER 
during  the  period  of  2014-2021  using  bibliometric  analysis.  Publish  or 
Perish software to collect citation data from Google Scholar was used as 
an  analysis  instrument  for  the  impact  of  the  articles.  It  was  found  that 
short-titled articles received more citations than long-titled articles (over 
2  times  greater),  but  not  statistically  significant  (p>0.05).  On  the  other 
hand,  correlation  between  citation  and  download  numbers  was  found  to 
be a statistically significant positive (rS=0.289 and rP=0.524; p<0.01). In 
the  analysis  of  keywords  and  titles,  it  was  observed  that  the  prominent 
words overlapped with each other and with the purpose of journal as well. 
The  most  cited  articles  and  the  institutions  contributing  to  national  and 
international  levels  were  analyzed  too.  It  was  concluded  that  83.72%  of 
the  authors  were  in  Turkey,  there  was  no  “institutional  localization” 
among the institutions contributing at the national level and that they had 
achieved  significant  success  in  terms  of  national  recognition.  PER  has 
gained significant momentum in academic standards and visibility since it 
first  joined  the  umbrella  organization  DergiPark  in  2019.  It  should  be 
noted  that  amongst  the  most  important  points  toward  being  open  to 
development  in  the  point  of  international  recognition  is  the  existence  of 
contributions  from  Anglo-Saxon  and  Continental  European  countries, 
which have appeared as limited. According to the findings, it is discussed 
what  can  be  done  from  this  point  onward  based  on  basic  publishing 
standards,  publication  content,  national/international  visibility,  and

of studies and the editors and referees during the selection and evaluation 
phases. 

Introduction 

Knowledge from past to present has been the most important source of development 
of  societies  and  has  brought  different  societies  together  through  various  communication 
channels.  The  scientific  accumulation  that  emerges  through  knowledge  is  shared  through 
communication  channels  and  makes  it  possible  to  discuss  different  ideas  in  the  scientific 
literature.  In  particular,  books  and  academic journals  play  a  leading  role among  the  official 
communication  languages  of  science  in  the  construction,  dissemination  and  use  of 
information  (Abramo,  2018;  Hicks,  2012;  Riviera,  2013;  Sivertsen  &  Larsen,  2012). 
However, the communication sources used between the branches of science may differ over 
time. The main reasons for this difference include many reasons such as whether the area has 
universal or local characteristics, is up-to-date or retrospective, and is suitable for teamwork 
or  individual  work  (Andersen,  2000;  Diem  &  Wolter,  2013;  Hicks,  1999;  Hicks,  2012; 
Nederhof, 2006; Uçak Özenç & Al, 2008). The production and consumption of information is 
largely carried out at the national level for many reasons such as the fact that social sciences 
are  not  as  biased  and  universal  as  medicine,  engineering  and  basic  sciences,  and  that  the 
information  produced  is  affected  by  regional,  personal  and  social  conditions,  political  and 
cultural  climate  (Andersen,  2000;  Diem  &  Wolter,  2013;  Hicks,  1999;  Moed,  2005;  Uçak 
Özenç  &  Al,  2008).  Therefore,  while  the  concern  for  universality  and  currency  features 
academic  journals  in  the  field  of  medicine,  engineering  or  basic  sciences  as  a  primary 
communication  tool,  the  absence  of  time  pressure  in  most  sub-sciences  of  social  sciences, 
especially the importance of retrospective and archival knowledge, makes books stand out as 
a communication tool rather than academic journals (Hicks, 2012; Uçak Özenç & Al, 2008). 

to 

to  come 

the  forefront  as  a  widely  used  communication 

The field of education is a sub-science field of social sciences where academic journals have 
come  to  the  forefront  in  recent  times  (Aman  &  Botte,  2017;  Orbay,  Karamustafaoğlu,  & 
Miranda, 2021; Örnek, Miranda, & Orbay, 2021). It is apparent that academic journals have 
started 
to 
internationalization in the field of education, rapid development of field relations with other 
branches  of  science  over  time  and  developments  in  information  technologies  (Engels  et  al., 
2012;  Larivière  et  al.,  2006;  Rowlinson  et  al.,  2015;  Henriksen,  2016).  As  Goodyear  et  al. 
(2009) emphasized, this field is inherently interdisciplinary within social sciences and is very 
open to interaction with other disciplines due to its wide content. Budd and Magnuson (2010), 
in  their  studies examining the citation  patterns  of  articles  published  in  journals  that  publish 
heavily  on  higher  education,  have  revealed  that  journals  were  cited  by  45.5%,  while  books 
were cited with a rate of 26.3%. Similarly, in a study of educational research by the twenty 
most prolific European countries between 2002 and 2013, Aman and Botte (2017) revealed 
that  the  number  of  articles  produced  by  international  cooperation  in  education  increased 
steadily from 14.1% in 2002 to 21.7% in 2013. In a similar study, Orbay et al. (2021) showed 
that internationalization increased from 20.6% in 2013 to 29.1% in 2018. 

tool  due 

Today,  advances  in  information  technologies  have  made  it  possible  and  cheaply  to  access 
information easily and have increased the amount of information available by doubling every 
day (Fire & Guestrin, 2019). The competitive environment created by the increasing number 
of  academic  journals  over  time  has  brought  along  the  idea  of  “publish  or  perish!”  among 
researchers  and also  questions  of “quality  or  quantity?”  in  studies  conducted  (Civera et al., 

Participatory Educational Research (PER)

Participatory Educational Research (PER), 9 (4);153-171, 1 July 2022 

2020; McGrail, Rickard, & Jones, 2006; Van Dalen, 2021). Therefore, it is becoming more 
and  more important to  follow  the  publications  produced  in academic  journals,  to  determine 
the  characteristics  of  academic  journals  and  publications  and  to  analyze  them  based  on 
various  criteria,  to  understand  the  present  and  to  make  inferences  between  past  and  future 
(Engels  et  al.,  2012;  Larivière  et  al.,  2006;  Öner  &  Orbay,  2022;  Rowlinson  et  al.,  2015; 
Henriksen, 2016). Therefore, it is widely used as a quality measurement tool to analyze the 
environments  in  which  scientific  information  is  published  with  various  mathematical  and 
statistical  techniques  (Donthu et al.,  2021).  One  of  the  widely  used  tools  for  measuring  the 
contribution of journals to the field of science is Bibliometric analysis method, first defined 
by Pritchard (1969). 

In this context, “Participatory Educational Research (PER)-ISSN: 2148-6123)” journal, which 
started its publication life in English in 2014 as an open access in the field of education, has 
become  one  of  the  journals  contributing  to  the  field  by  being  indexed  in  major  worldwide 
databases at national and international level in a short time (PER, 2022). 

PER started  its academic publication life  as two  issues  per year and was published as three 
and four issues per year over the years. Starting in 2022, it has decided to publish the journal 
as six issues per year. No fees are charged to the researchers under any name in the evaluation 
or publication processes of articles. Studies are subjected to peer evaluation by double-blind 
peer-review  method.  It  is  designed  as  a  journal  that  is  open  to  research  carried  out  by 
qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods in all areas of education. The main objective of the 
journal  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  learning,  teacher,  and  teaching  by  contributing  to  the 
educational processes carried out at all levels of education starting from preschool education, 
and  to  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  their  processes  and  results  (PER,  2022).  In  2019, 
PER has started to carry out its publication life under  the umbrella of DergiPark platform in 
TUBITAK ULAKBIM, which provides electronic hosting and editorial process management 
services  for  academic  peer-reviewed  journals  published  in  Turkey  (ULAKBIM,  2022).  The 
journal has started to be indexed in Scopus and ERIC (The Education Resource Information 
Center) databases, where reputable journals in the field of education at international level are 
indexed. On the other hand, the ESCI (Emerging Sources Citation Index) application in the 
Web of Science (WoS-Core Collection by Clarivate Analytics) database is under evaluation 
(PER, 2022). 

Aim of the Study 

In this study, it was aimed to analyze articles published in PER  during the period of 
2014-2021 using bibliometric analysis, which is one of the qualitative research methods. For 
this purpose, answers to the following research questions (RQ) were sought: 

RQ1: How do the number of articles and the number of authors change by year? What 
is  the  distribution  of  authors  according  to  the  institutions  they  work  for  at  national  and 
international levels? 

RQ2: How are the articles distributed by author and citation numbers? What are the 

most cited articles? 

RQ3:  What  are  the  words  commonly  used  in  the  titles  and  keywords  of  articles?  Is 
there  a  correlation  between  the  number  of  words  in  the  title  and  the  number  of  citations 
received by the article?

RQ4:  Is  there  a  correlation  between  the  number  of  downloads  of  articles  and  the 

number of citations they receive? 

Methodology 

The sample of this research consists of 347 articles published in PER between 2014 
and 2021. The identity information and content analyses of the articles were carried out with 
the  data  obtained  via  DergiPark  platform  (ULAKBİM,  2022).  Publish  or  Perish  software 
(Harzing,  2007)  was  used  to  determine  the  citation  numbers.  In  this  software,  the  Google 
Scholar index, which is  considered the index with the most common scanning network and 
scans not only printed articles but also many early print and institute stores, has been selected 
(Doğan,  Şencan,  &  Tonta,  2016;  Harzing  &  Alakangas,  2016;  Jacsó,  2005;  Jacsó,  2009). 
Duplicate references to related articles, references from sources other than articles, books and 
papers have been cleared. The citation scan was conducted for the period from January 20, 
2022, to January 25, 2022. Throughout the study, the focus was on articles and review studies. 
However, since only one review study was detected in the specified period, the article will be 
named jointly for the reviews and articles in the following sections. 

Whether the obtained data was parametric or not was determined as a result  of the analysis 
(George & Mallery, 2010). According to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the descriptive 
statistics of variables results (skewness, kurtosis values and graphical representations such as 
histograms, Q-Q plots and box plots), as the data found to be skewed, the data were presented 
as medians and interquartile ranges. And then the comparisons between the number of total 
citations,  the  number  of  words  in  the  title  and  the  visibility  were  performed  using  the 
nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test for two groups and Kruskal-Wallis test for three groups. 
Spearman’s coefficient (rS) test was used to investigate the correlation between the number of 
words in the title, the number of downloads and the citation counts. A  p-value less than 0.05 
was considered statistically significant, and IBM SPSS 20 software (Armonk, NY, USA) was 
used for the analysis of data. 

Findings and Discussion 

In this section, findings related to research questions were given and the results were 

discussed with relevant literature. 

Findings and Discussion for RQ1 

The change in the number of articles and authors depending on the years is given in 
Figure 1. As shown from Figure 1, 347 articles were published during the period in question 
and the number of articles varies significantly depending on the years. However, in academic 
journalism, the number of articles in each issue of the journal is expected to be balanced both 
on  a  number/volume  basis  and  depending  on  the  years  (Clarivate  Analytics,  2022;  Scopus, 
2022; TR Index, 2022). Meanwhile, the average number of authors per article remains almost 
linearly constant.

It  can  be  considered  that,  among  the  main  reasons  why  such  a  situation  has  arisen  in  the 
change of the number of publications in PER, two special issues were published in 2015-2016 
and that the journal has published different numbers over the years. On the other hand, it can 
be  considered  that  the  journal  has  started  to  be  indexed  in  ERIC  and  Scopus,  which  are 
accepted  internationally,  since  2019.  This  interest  brings  positive  correlation  between  the 
qualities  and  quantities  of  the  articles.  One  of  the  main  reasons  for  this  situation  is  that 
publishing  in  journals  with  high  impact value  indexed  in  important  databases  is  considered 
very  prestigious  within  the  academic  ecosystem  and  is  a  natural  result  of  the  supply  and 
demand shown to these journals (Huang, 2016). 

During this period, all articles received a total of 1675 citations. The majority of citations are 
citations from journals indexed in Scopus and ERIC, mostly TR indexes. In this context, the 
articles  published  in  the  period  were  written  by  533  authors,  and  it  was  concluded  that 
83.72% of the authors  were in  Turkey. On the other hand, it was seen that authors  from 19 
different  countries  besides  Turkey  contributed  to  the  journal  with  their  articles.  The  most 
prolific ten countries based on the percentage of these authors was given in Figure 2.

During the analysis process of the articles from Turkey, authors working in different schools 
affiliated  with  the  Ministry  of  National  Education  were  gathered  under  the  umbrella  of 
“Ministry  of  National  Education-Ankara”.  It  is  observed  that  there  are  authors  from  99 
different institutions from Turkey. On the other hand, researchers from countries other than 
Turkey were grouped within themselves and found to have contributions from a total of 45 
different  institutions.  In  other  words,  it  is  possible  to  say  that  articles  from  144  different 
institutions  were  published  in  PER  during  the  period  in  question.  Based  on  this  data,  the 
distribution  of  the  top  ten  contributing  institutions  at  national  and  international  level 
according to the number of authors is given in Table 1.

It  is  noticeable  that  the  most  active  institutions  at  both  national  and  international  level  are 
universities,  and  especially  education  faculties  come  to  tkm  .he  fore.  This  situation  is  in 
agreement  with  the  literature  (Moed,  2006).  Examining  the  distribution  of  the  top  ten 
institutions,  Amasya  University  (10.52%),  Ondokuz  Mayıs  University  (7.93%)  and  The 
Ministry  of  National  Education  (5.48%)  are  in  the  top  three.  Considering  the  contribution 
rates of the top ten institutions at national level, there is no “institutional localization”. When 
the  institutions  in  which  the  authors  worked  at  the  national  level  were  examined  on  a 
provincial basis, it was seen that the articles were published from all provinces except only 19 
provinces out of a total of 81 provinces. On the other hand, it is seen that the vast majority of 
provinces  that  do  not  publish  articles  are  relatively  small  in  population  (Ardahan,  Iğdır, 
Yalova, Bitlis, etc.) or that there is no institute or faculty of education within the university or 
is not active in these provinces. In this context, as seen from Figure 3, it is possible to say that 
PER has achieved significant recognition on the academic platform in a short period of time 
within the scope of Turkey.

Among  the  most  basic  requirements  of  scanning  in  internationally  accepted  indexes,  the 
authors, editors, and members of the editorial advisory board of the journal want to have an 
international  diversity  in  accordance  with  the  target  audience  of  the  journal  (Clarivate 
Analytics,  2022;  Scopus,  2022).  If  the  content  of  the  journal  is  aimed  at  an  international 
audience, it is desirable that the authors with international diversity who will contribute to the 
goal will be visible at this point. When the PER editorial board is examined, it is seen that 
there are expert researchers from 16 different countries. Countries other than Turkey include 
researchers from Spain (7), USA (6), South Africa (5), UK (3), Canada (3) and Australia (3). 
Given that author participation at international level is 16.8%, it can be considered that PER 
at first glance fits the definition of “Globally national-locally international journal” (Pajić & 
Jevremov, 2014). This characterization has been passed into the literature as a concept used 
for international authors or journals that do not receive references from articles published in 
relatively  international  journals  (Tonta,  2017).  It  is  known  that  this  applies  to  Turkish-
addressed  journals  in  citation  indexes  even  before  such  a  definition  is  introduced  into  the 
literature. As such, the findings of a study conducted through 71 journals addressed in Turkey 
in  citation  indexes  reveal  that  at  least  one  author  is  from  Turkey  in  four  out  of  every  five 
publications in the journals examined (Doğan, Dhyi, & Al, 2018). However, at this point, it 
can be considered that the fact that the fields of study in a social science such as education are 
mostly  aimed  at  the  local  audience  weakens  the  possibility  of  having  a  comprehensive 
international  diversity.  In  this  case,  such  journals  are  typically  expected  to  have  a  more 
modest  citation  effect  and  measurements  can  be  made  by  looking  at  the  authenticity  of  the 
content of the journals. 

PER is indexed in “Education” and “Developmental and Educational Psychology” categories 
in  the  Scopus  database.  As  seen  from  Figure  4,  while  the  journal  ranks  1088th  in  terms  of 
citation among 1319 journals in the Education category, it is the 295th out of 332 journals in 
the  “Developmental  and  Educational  Psychology”  category  (Scopus,  2022).  A  total  of  79 
articles indexed between 2017 and 2020 received 31 citations during this period, and Scopus 
CiteScore 2020 is 0.4 (Calculated on 05 May 2021). On the other hand, the total number of 
citations received by the 178 articles published in PER and indexed in the Scopus database is 
currently 115, and in other words, CiteScore Tracker 2021 has increased to 0.6 (Last updated 
on 07 March 2022). 

Figure 4. CiteScore trend for a) “Education” category b) “Developmental and Educational 
Psychology” category (Scopus, 2022). 

On  the  other  hand,  the  articles  published  in  the  journals  indexed  in  the  WoS  database  are 
considered the most prestigious in the academic community (Birkle et al., 2021;  Li, Rollins, 
& Yan, 2018; Pranckutė, 2021). The distribution of the references received from the journals

in  the  WoS  database  according  to  the  journal  quartiles  (Orbay,  Miranda,  &  Orbay,  2020) 
published  in  PER  was  also  studied.  The  articles  published  in  PER  received  a  total  of  203 
citations from the journals in the WoS database. This means that 12.12% of the total citations 
to PER were made from journals in the WoS database. In the case of a journal in more than 
one quarter, the high quarter was taken into account using the optimistic approach (Liu, Hu, & 
Gu, 2016) and the results obtained were summarized in Figure 5. 

Figure 5. Distribution of Citations from WoS Database by Journal Quartiles. 

As  seen  from  Figure  5,  52.71%  of  citations  from  the  WoS  database  come  from  journals 
indexed in ESCI. On the other hand, the citation rate from journals in with high impact value 
(Q1, Q2) is 24.63%. The rest (22.66%) comes from journals in the low quartiles (Q3, Q4). 

Findings and Discussion for RQ2 

One  scale  that can  be considered  as an important  criterion  for  teamwork  rather  than 
individual studies, especially in educational research, is the number of authors in the relevant 
research. Between 2014 and 2021, the articles published in PER were written by an average 
of  2.02  authors  (median=2).  Single  and  multi-authorship  status  percentages  are  given  in

Henriksen (2016) found out in his research covering the sub-sciences of social sciences that 
publications  in  educational  research  were  written  as  single  authors  between  1980 and  2000 
and with two authors between 2001 and 2013; on the other hand, found out that research in 
the field of special education was written with two authors between 1980 and 2010 and three 
as  of  2011-2013.  Örnek  et  al.  (2021)  emphasized  that  the  research  was  written  with  three 
authors in a similar study focused on the field of special education for the period 2014-2018. 
Therefore, in terms of the number of authors, the findings of this study are in line with the 
studies in the international literature. 

For  the connections  between  the  authors (a  total  of  89 authors)  whose two  or more  articles 
were  published  in  PER  during  that  period,  the  network  density  map  was  given  in  Figure  7 
(red=high-density;  blue=low-density)  using  the  VOSviewer  1.6.13  program  (Van  Eck  & 
Waltman, 2010), which is often used for bibliometric mapping demonstration. Since the time 
frame in question is not very large, only a few cluster structures stand out. When articles and 
citations were analyzed in detail, the articles published by Korkmaz Ö, Çakır R and Kayaoğlu 
MN,  who  were  among  the  most  prolific  authors  (3.17,  2.30  and  1.15%  of  total  papers), 
contributed  over  3%  to  the  total  citations  from  the  journal  (7.40,  3.05  and  3.10%  of  total 
citations)  respectively.  On  the  other  hand,  the  articles  published  by  Saltan  F,  Ocak  G  and 
Ocak  İ,  who  were  among  the  most  prolific  authors  (1.73,  1.44  and  1.15%  of  total  papers), 
contributed less than 1% to the total citations from the journal (0.19, 0.18 and 0.06% of total 
citations). Among the most prolific authors outside Turkey was only Norma MN (2.02% of 
total papers and 1.43% of total citations) from South Africa. 

Figure 7. Author Co-occurrence Network Density Distribution Map. 

The average number of citations per article in the specified period is 4.69 (median=1). On the 
other hand, the percentage of articles not yet cited is 35.73%. However, it should be noted that 
the percentage of articles published in the last two years is 49.20% in this rate. As expected, 
the share of articles with no citations is greater at the recent years as these articles had less 
time to accumulate citations than an older one. However, these articles still have the potential 
to  receive  citations  in  the  future  due  to  the  nature  of  social  sciences  (Archambault  &

Bibliometric Profile of an Emerging Journal: Participatory Educational Research      R.Arslan, K.Orbay, M.Orbay 

Larivière, 2010). Although the average number of citations per article seems high, it is often 
not the right approach to make general judgments about all articles in the journal based on the 
citations that articles receive because the most important problem to encounter in the journal 
evaluation  process  is  the  skewness  of  citation,  as  in  almost  all  journals  (Albarrán,  &  Ruiz-
Castillo, 2011; Bornmann, & Leydesdorff, 2017; Seglen, 1997). To explain this situation in 
PER,  the  open  tags  of  the  top  ten  most  cited  articles,  total  citation  numbers  and  citation 
numbers per year are given in Table 2.

As shown in Table 2, the ten most cited articles constitute approximately 2.88% of all articles, 
while the number of citations received by these articles corresponds to 35.76% of the number 
of citations received by the journal. Similarly, 10% of articles receive approximately 58.99% 
of  citations.  Meanwhile,  taking  account of  this  fact, to  study the  degree  of  skewness  of  the 
citation distributions in PER, the skewness of the citation distributions published by articles 
during 2014-2021 was analyzed using SPSS software. The descriptive statistics of the citation 
numbers  were  summarized  as  follows  minimum=0;  maximum=129;  skewness=6.247; 
kurtosis=50.231. As expected, the positive skewed distributions were obtained, which means 
that the distribution of citations in PER is highly skewed to the right and has a long right tail. 
On the other hand, it is possible to see similar results in studies focused on citation skewness, 
especially educational  journals  and  special  education  journals  indexed  in the WoS  database 
between  2014  and  2018  (Orbay,  Karamustafaoğlu,  &  Miranda,  2021;  Örnek,  Miranda,  & 
Orbay, 2021). 

Findings and Discussion for RQ3 

Most researchers who study a topic usually look at the title of the article to decide if it 
is relevant to them or scan it based on keywords related to research topics (Jamali & Nikzad, 
2011). Therefore, the first impression that the title creates in the reader plays a major role in 
whether the article is read in detail or not. Therefore, the title is extremely important since it is 
the section that provides the most basic information about the content of an article (Hartley, 

Participatory Educational Research (PER)  

-162- 

 
 
Participatory Educational Research (PER), 9 (4);153-171, 1 July 2022 

2008). A study of open-access journals has shown that the lower number of characters in the 
title  is  associated  with  the  higher  number  of  citations  (Paiva,  Lima,  &  Paiva,  2012).  In  a 
similar study, when articles published between 2007 and 2013 were examined, it was found 
that  short-titled  articles  received  a  higher  number  of  citations  (Letchford,  Moat,  &  Preis, 
2015).  The  reasons  for  this  relationship  were  listed  as  follows  (Letchford,  Moat,  &  Preis, 
2015):  journals  with  high  impact  factors  limit  the  number  of  title  characters;  more  recent 
research or research on emerging subjects have longer titles due to the need to be explained 
and  they  are  published  in  less  prestigious  journals;  short  titles  are  easier  to  read,  easier  to 
understand,  so  attract  more  readers.  Meanwhile,  Elgendi  (2019)  used  the  machine  learning 
approach to investigate the characteristics of highly cited papers and emphasized that a good 
title consists of 10±3 words (see: Elgendi (2019) for the recent detailed discussion). 

Based on this data, the titles and citations of the articles published in PER were analyzed. It 
was  determined  that  maximum  (29)  and  minimum  (4)  words  were  used  for  the  number  of 
words in the title. The word count was sorted from less to high, and they were divided into 
three  groups  considering  their  median  values:  Less,  Medium  and  High  group,  respectively, 
and the descriptive statistics for each group are given in Table 3.

As seen from Table 3, it was found that short-titled articles received more citations than long-
titled articles (over 2 times greater). However, the citation difference among the groups is not 
statistically  significant  (p>0.05).  It  may  be  related  to  the  limited  number  of  articles.  This 
result is agreement with the literature (Elgendi, 2019; Gnewuch & Wohlrabe, 2017). 

A total of 1424 keywords were used in the articles. Word cloud work using WordArt program 
(2022) was carried out for these keywords and words that are frequently used in the title. In 
Figure 8, the size of each word is prepared according to the frequency of mentions in the title 
and keywords. Each word or group of words that appear in this image is fully compatible with 
the scope of the journal. The  most repeated keywords are education (f=129), teacher (f=88), 
learning (f=79), science (f=57) and technology (f=53), while the words commonly used in the 
title  section  are  teacher  (f=85),  student  (f=82),  education  (f=77),  learn  (f=55)  and  school 
(f=55), respectively.

Figure 8. Word Cloud for Keywords (a) and (b) Words in the Title. 

On the other hand, when the keywords are carefully examined, some keywords are designated 
as very general concepts (sun, organ, word, etc.) or abbreviation words specific to that article 
(AWS,  CIRC,  IMMS,  etc.)  are  used  as  keywords.  Of  course,  keywords  should  show  the 
general  topic,  but  they  should  not  be  kept  too  broad  and  should  not  consist  of  acronyms 
specific to that article. 

Findings and Discussion for RQ4 

The open access publication of articles that play important roles in the construction, 
dissemination  and  use  of  scientific  knowledge  presents  an  important  opportunity  especially 
for  researchers  with  limited  access  to  articles.  On  the  other  hand,  open  access  articles  are 
naturally read more and can receive more citations as a result (Piwowar et al., 2018; Piwowar, 
Priem,  & Orr,  2019). There was a statistically significant positive correlation  (rs=0.289  and 
rp=0.524; p<0.01) between the number of downloads of articles and the number of citations 
they received.  On the other hand, there were no correlations among the number of citations 
and other bibliometric indicators such as the number of authors, the number of words in the 
title. 

In a similar study on literature medical journals  (Xue-li, Hong-ling, & Mei-ying, 2011), this 
correlation was found at r=0.491. In another study (Nieder, Dalhaug, & Aandahl, 2013), the 
correlation level was limited (from r=0.1 to r=0.53) depending on the type of documents. On 
the other hand, a study of publications on two information systems journals between 2002 and 
2012  found  a  positive  high  correlation  between  the  number  of  downloads  and  citations  at 
r=0.77-0.76 (Schlögl et al., 2014). In a recent similar study focus on Library Philosophy and 
Practice journal,  Arslan et al.  (2022)  found  out that  the  correlations  between  download and 
citation counts from Scopus and Google Scholar databases were determined to be statistically 
significant  positive  (rS=0.261  and  rP=0.310;  rS=0.636  and  rP=0.356;  p<0.01),  respectively. 
Meanwhile, it is possible to see a broad critique of the analysis of the relationship between 
download and the citation numbers by Hu et al. (2021).

PER, which has been published with open access since 2014, continues to live its publishing 
life with open access  via DergiPark platform  since 2019. Meanwhile, it should be note that 
the  descriptive  statistics  of  the  number  of  downloads  were  summarized  as  follows 
mean=304.19,  minimum=81;  maximum=2000;  skewness=3.451;  kurtosis=18.063.  As 
expected, the positive skewed distributions were obtained, which means that the distribution 
of the number of downloads in PER is highly skewed to the right and has a long right tail. 
When the number of downloads data was analyzed by dividing them into two separate groups, 
before and after joining the DergiPark, it was observed that there was a significant difference 
between the groups. As clearly seen from the mean rank values in Table 4, this difference is 
in favor of the group after DergiPark.

On  the  other  hand,  the  change  in  the  average  number  of  citations  per  article  and  median 
citations  over  the  years  were  summarized  in  Figure  9.  It  was  observed  that  the  average 
number of citations per article had exceeded the general trend line. Finally, according to these 
findings,  PER  had  gained  significant  momentum  in  academic  standards  and  visibility  since 
the umbrella of joining DergiPark in 2019.

Conclusion 

Academic  journals  play  an  indispensable  role  among  the  official  communication 
languages  of  science  in  the  construction,  dissemination,  and  use  of  information.  In  this 
context, PER has made a significant distance towards internationalization by contributing to 
the field of education and soon starting to be indexed in important databases such as ERIC 
and  Scopus.  It  was  concluded  that  83.72%  of  the  authors  were  in  Turkey,  there  was  no 
“institutional  localization”  among  the  institutions  contributing  at  the  national  level  and  that 
they had achieved significant success in terms of national recognition. However, it is seen that

-165- 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bibliometric Profile of an Emerging Journal: Participatory Educational Research      R.Arslan, K.Orbay, M.Orbay 

there are many areas open to development at the point of international recognition. What to do 
at this point is summarized below. 

•  The  fact  that  researchers  from  Anglo-Saxon  and  Continental  European  countries, 
especially  USA,  which  stands  out  in  the  field  of  education  with  both  article 
productivity and the widespread influence of articles (Sezgin, Orbay, & Orbay, 2022a; 
Sezgin, Orbay, & Orbay, 2022b), has been limited in PER is an important issue that 
must be overcome in front of the internationalization of the journal. If it is taken into 
account  that  there  are  enough  editorial  board  members  from  these  countries  in  this 
regard,  the  more  active  participation  of  the  board  members  and  their  affiliated 
institutions with their articles will provide significant gains to the journal. On the other 
hand, as Allik et al. (2020) emphasized, low-population, well-managed countries with 
long  democratic  backgrounds  (Netherlands,  Belgium,  Finland,  etc.)  should  be 
encouraged to participate in the journal in their researchers from these countries, based 
on the fact that they are very successful in transforming their economic success into 
high-quality research in the field of education as well as in all fields. 

•  To  increase  the  readability  and  the  visibility  of  the  articles  and  to  prevent  possible 
mistakes by the authors, the preparation of some guidelines regarding the fundamental 
concepts of writing a research paper such as the determination of the title, construction 
of  the  abstract,  choosing  the  right  keywords  etc.  for  the  researchers  submitting 
manuscripts to the journal are of great importance from the writing strategies point of 
view (Gastel & Day, 2017); in addition, it would be appreciated as an important step 
to share these guidelines in the journal web page to improve the publishing standards 
of  PER.  Furthermore,  many  journals  with  a  high  international  reputation  utilize  the 
statistics of past years such as the acceptance rate, the average or median time to first 
decision, and average or median review time to inform the researchers. Application of 
a similar procedure in PER will be beneficial, fruitful, and sound to provide necessary 
information  for  the  researchers  planning  to  submit  manuscripts  to  the  journal  for  a 
possible evaluation for publication. 
It is seen that only one review paper was published during the period of bibliometric 
analysis. Especially in the field of education, the original studies are  scanned in great 
detail  and  widely,  and  the  systematic  reviews  in  which  the  findings  are  synthesized 
and  the  meta-analysis  reviews  where  the  results  of  the  studies  made  by  different 
researchers  on  the  same  subject  are  examined  with  appropriate  statistics  in  quantity 
and  quality  are  very  important  in  determining  the  direction  of  the  researchers. 
Although the review articles will give important clues to the researchers who will start 
researching on a new topic, they will contribute to the recognition of the journal and 
the  citation  issue,  which  is  an  important  measure  of  the  widespread  impact  of  the 
paper  (Miranda  &  Garcia-Carpintero,  2018).  In  this  context,  it  will  be  an  important 
step  to  call  for  articles  by  inviting  researchers  who  come  to  the  forefront  with  their 
national and international publications in their fields. 

• 

•  With the growth of scientific literature and the widespread use of the internet, social 
media  platforms  such  as  Researchgate,  Twitter,  Linkedln,  Facebook,  and  blogs  are 
becoming  more  and  more  important  in  communicating  the  results  of  scientific 
research  to  large  audiences  (Shrivastava  &  Mahajan,  2022;  Sudah  et  al.,  2022). 
Considering these latest developments, interactive applications such as sharing articles 
and prominent findings in articles and interaction between researchers and authors can 
be  developed  in  social  media  environments,  which  will  be  established  in  PER  to 
increase  the  positive  meaningful  relationship  between  the  number  of  downloads  of 

Participatory Educational Research (PER)  

-166- 

 
Participatory Educational Research (PER), 9 (4);153-171, 1 July 2022 

articles  and  the  number  of  citations  they  receive.  Similarly,  it  would  be  useful  to 
switch to “Highlights”, which consists of three to five items that have recently been 
implemented  in  journals  published  by  many  internationally  recognized  publishers 
(Elsevier, Taylor & Francis, John Wiley & Sons, etc.), featured in articles and helped 
to increase their discovery in search engines. 

Finally, the findings can guide authors during the writing phase of studies and the editors and 
referees  during  the  selection  and  evaluation  phases.  Therefore,  what  has  been  done  and 
published in PER to date should be a new starting point to get to a better position. 

Limitations 

Despite  several  notable  contributions,  this  study  had  a  few  limitations.  First, 
Bibliometric  indicators  based  on  citation  number  are  time-dependent  indicators  and  can 
change over time. Second, only the Google Scholar index was used in the citation search and 
self-citations were not checked in the study. Finally, the small number of articles constituting 
the sample is another important limitation. All these limitations reduce the generalizability of 
the results obtained in the study. 

Conflict of Interest 

The authors declare that this study was conducted in the absence of any commercial or 

financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. 

Funding 

This  study  received  no  specific  grant  from  any  funding  agency  in  the  public, 

commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
