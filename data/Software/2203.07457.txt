Abstract

Fast neutron identiﬁcation and spectroscopy is of great interest to nuclear
physics experiments. Using the neutron elastic scattering, the fast neutron
momentum can be measured. Wang and Morris introduced the theoretical
concept that the initial fast neutron momentum can be derived from up to
three consecutive elastic collisions between the neutron and the target, in-
cluding the information of two consecutive recoil ion tracks and the vertex
position of the third collision or two consecutive elastic collisions with the
timing information. Here we also include the additional possibility of mea-
suring the deposited energies from the recoil ions. In this paper, we simulate
the neutron elastic scattering using the Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport
Code (MCNP) and study the corresponding neutron detection and tracking
eﬃciency. The corresponding eﬃciency and the scattering distances are sim-
ulated with diﬀerent target materials, especially natural silicon (92.23% 28Si,
4.67% 29Si, and 3.1% 30Si) and helium-4 (4He). The timing of collision and
the recoil ion energy are also investigated, which are important characters
for the detector design. We also calculate the ion travelling range for diﬀer-
ent energies using the software, “The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter
(SRIM)”, showing that the ion track can be most conveniently observed in
4He unless sub-micron spatial resolution can be obtained in silicon.

1. Introduction

One important reaction for fast neutron (neutron kinetic energy Ek,n ¿
∼10 keV) detection is elastic neutron scattering by light nuclei such as 1H
and its isotope 2H, 4He, and others. The cross sections of other reactions,

e.g., neutron capture, decrease rapidly with increasing neutron energy. In
elastic neutron scattering, the incoming neutron can transfer a portion of its
kinetic energy to the target nucleus. Wang and Morris
[1] suggested the
scenarios to track fast neutrons using the tracks of recoil ions and vertex
positions of the collisions (method 1 and method 2 in Section 2). Addition-
ally, the angle between the incoming neutron and the scattered neutron may
be also determined by the deposited energies from the recoil ions and the
vertex positions of the two successive collisions, allowing method 3 for neu-
tron tracking, as described in Section 2. In this paper, we verify these three
methods for fast neutron tracking using the Monte Carlo N-Particle Trans-
port Code (MCNP) [2] simulations and study the corresponding eﬃciencies
with a cubic detector made of natural silicon (92.23% 28Si, 4.67% 29Si, and
3.1% 30Si) or 4He. The study here would be helpful for next-generation neu-
tron tracking detectors, showing the limitation of the fast neutron tracking
and possible designs of detectors.

Below, we ﬁrst describe the fast neutron tracking principle in Section 2.
Next, we explain the method of the MCNP Monte Carlo simulations in Sec-

parameters. In Section 5, we show the ion traveling range using the software
of The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) [3] in order to evaluate
the feasibility of current detector technologies. A brief summary is given at
the end.

2. Basic Idea of Fast Neutron Tracking

Figure 1 shows the schematic of three consecutive recoil ion tracks. The
recoil ion momenta are (cid:126)Q1, (cid:126)Q2, and (cid:126)Q3. The initial neutron momentum is
(cid:126)P0 = p0(cid:126)e0, where (cid:126)e0 is the unit vector, and the successive neutron momenta
are (cid:126)P1 = p1(cid:126)e1 and (cid:126)P2 = p2(cid:126)e2, where (cid:126)e1 and (cid:126)e2 are the unit vectors which
can be determined by the vertex positions A, B, and C of the collisions. The
mass of a neutron is mn and the mass of the recoil ion is mi.

In method 1 (M1), three ion tracks are suﬃcient to measure the initial
momentum of the fast neutrons. Using the momentum conservation at the
vertex B,

(cid:126)P1 = (cid:126)Q2 + (cid:126)P2.

Dotting with (cid:126)e1 or (cid:126)e2, Equation (1) becomes
p1 = (cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e1 + p2(cid:126)e2 · (cid:126)e1

(1)

(2)

2

or

respectively. Therefore,

p1(cid:126)e1 · (cid:126)e2 = (cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e2 + p2,

and

p1 = (cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e1 + (p1(cid:126)e1 · (cid:126)e2 − (cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e2)(cid:126)e2 · (cid:126)e1

→ p1 =

(cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e1 − ( (cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e2) cos Θ2
1 − cos2 Θ2

p2 =p1(cid:126)e1 · (cid:126)e2 − (cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e2

=

(cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e1 − ( (cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e2)((cid:126)e2 · (cid:126)e1)
1 − ((cid:126)e1 · (cid:126)e2)2

((cid:126)e1 · (cid:126)e2) − (cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e2

= −

(cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e2 − ( (cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e1) cos Θ2
1 − cos2 Θ2

(3)

(4)

(5)

where (cid:126)e1 · (cid:126)e2 = cos Θ2.

Using the momentum conservation at the vertex A, the initial linear mo-

mentum of the fast neutron would be

(cid:126)P0 = (cid:126)Q1 + (cid:126)P1

= (cid:126)Q1 +

(cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e1 − ( (cid:126)Q2 · (cid:126)e2) cos Θ2
1 − cos2 Θ2

(cid:126)e1.

(6)

Here, we show that the vectors (cid:126)Q1, (cid:126)Q2, and (cid:126)e1, (cid:126)e2 (or the vertices A, B,

C) are suﬃcient to determine (cid:126)P0.

In method 2 (M2), the time-of-ﬂight (TOF) of the fast neutron can be
determined between ion tracks. If the time delay between the vertex A and
B is measured as τ1, the velocity of the fast neutron is

v1 =

AB
τ1

(7)

where AB is the distance between vertex A and B, and the momentum of
the fast neutron is

p1 = γmnv1

3

(8)

where γ = 1/(cid:112)1 − (v1/c)2. Therefore, the initial linear momentum of the
fast neutron,

(cid:126)P0 = (cid:126)Q1 + p1(cid:126)e1

= (cid:126)Q1 + γmnv1(cid:126)e1,

(9)

can be determined by (cid:126)Q1, (cid:126)e1 and τ1 and there is no need of the third collision
vertex C.

with unknown momentum P0. A, B, and C are the vertices of three elastic collisions.
Q1, Q2, and Q3 are the momenta of the recoil ions (Adapted with permission from the
author Z. Wang in Ref. [1]).

For solid detectors, it is challenging to measure the recoil ion tracks.
Instead, it is straightforward to measure the recoil ion energy. Here, we
apply method 3 (M3), where we can measure the vertex A and B and the
corresponding time τ1 between two vertices. As Equation (8), v1 = AB/τ1,
p1 = γmnv1 and then (cid:126)P1 = p1(cid:126)e1. We can also measure the kinetic energy
of the recoil ion, i.e., the deposit energy, Ek,Q1, at the vertex A, so that the
total energy, EQ1, of the recoil ion at the vertex A is

E2

Q1 = (Q1c)2 + (mic2)2 = (Ek,Q1 + mic2)2

where mi is the mass of the recoil ion.

Using the energy and momentum conservation, we have

E0 + mic2 =E1 + EQ1,

(cid:126)P0 = (cid:126)Q1 + (cid:126)P1

4

(10)

(11)

(12)

where E0 is the total energy of the incoming neutron and E1 is the total
energy of the scattered neutron.

p0 can be derived from Equation (11) using

(cid:112)(p0c)2 + (mnc2)2 + mic2
=(cid:112)(p1c)2 + (mnc2)2 + (cid:112)(Q1c)2 + (mic2)2

(13)

where p1 is deﬁned in Equation (8) and Q1 is deﬁned in Equation (10) .

Equation (12) becomes

Q2

1 =p2
=p2

0 + p2
0 + p2

1 − 2 (cid:126)P0 · (cid:126)P1
1 − 2p0p1 cos Θ1.

Therefore, Θ1 can be derived from Equation (14) as

cos Θ1 =

0 + p2

1 − Q2

(14)

(15)

where p0 in Equation (13), p1 = γmnv1 and Ek,Q1 are measurable parameters.

3. MCNP Simulations

In order to evaluate the methods tracking fast neutrons using consecutive
recoil ion tracks [1], we apply the Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code
(MCNP)-6.2 [2] developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to
simulate the fast neutrons scattering in natural silicon (Si) of the density
ρSi = 2.329 g/cm3 and helium-4 (4He).

In the simulation, we consider a point-like mono-energetic neutron beam
shooting into a cubic target, i.e., a 10 cm3 Si cube or a 1 m3 He cube.
The silicon target is natural silicon while the 4He target has the form of
liquid helium (LHe) (ρLHe = 0.125 g/cm3), gas helium (GHe) of 50 bar
(ρGHe,50bar = 7.749 × 10−3g/cm3) and 10 bar (ρGHe,10bar = 1.638 × 10−3g/cm3)
in the same volume at the room temperature, 18 ◦C. For each energy, from 100
keV to 1000 MeV, one million neutrons are generated in order to study the
eﬃciency, the corresponding scattering ranges, and other properties. Figure 2
shows a few corresponding scattering events using 1 MeV neutrons and 100
MeV neutrons with the Si target and 1 MeV neutrons and 500 MeV neutrons
with the LHe target. Later, we show the scatter is more isotropic for low-
energy neutrons and anisotropic for high-energy neutrons. This is intrinsic
in the scattering theory, depending on the mass of the nucleus.

5

MCNP allows users to record “particle track output” (PTRAC). PTRAC
ﬁles collect the information of each collision/reaction, including reaction type,
particle type, track number, coordinate and time of collision, and velocity
direction and kinetic energy of the emitting particle. Here, we consider events
of three consecutive elastic recoils for M1 and two consecutive recoils for
M2 and M3. There is no ion track information in PTRAC. We calculate
this information using the incoming particle and the scattered particle. The
vectors (cid:126)e1 and (cid:126)e2 are derived from the collision vertex A, B, and C. The
vectors (cid:126)Q1 and (cid:126)Q2 are derived using the energy and momentum conservation
at the vertex A and B. For example, at the vertex B, the energy of the
incoming particle is E1 = Ek,1 + mnc2, where Ek,1 is the kinetic energy
recorded in PTRAC. Similarly, the energy of the scattered particle is E2 =
Ek,2 + mnc2. Therefore, p1c = (cid:112)E2
2 − (mnc2)2.
Since PTRAC records the velocity direction, we can derive (cid:126)P1 and (cid:126)P2. Then,
the momentum vector components can be derived as (cid:126)Q2 = (cid:126)P1 − (cid:126)P2. Using
(cid:126)e1 and (cid:126)e2 from the vertex A, B, and C, and (cid:126)Q1 and (cid:126)Q2 from the momentum
conservation, we can derive the information in Equation (6). Using (cid:126)e1 from
the vertex A and B, (cid:126)Q1 from the momentum conservation, and the time τ1
in PTRAC output, we can derive the information in Equation (9).

1 − (mnc2)2 and p2c = (cid:112)E2

4. Results and Discussion

Figure 3 shows the eﬃciency and the elastic cross section of the neutron
and the target as a function of the input neutron energy of M1, M2, and M3 in
the Si and He target. Here the eﬃciency is deﬁned as the ratio of simulation
events passing the selection criteria (two/three consecutive elastic recoils) to
the total number of input neutrons. The MCNP cross section is used in the
MCNP simulation, while the TALYS-1.95 [4, 5] cross section is just for the
comparison. The cross section of neutron–silicon has two resonances around
10 MeV and 300 MeV.

Since the M1 requires three consecutive scatterings while the M2/M3 re-
quires two consecutive scatterings with the timing information, the eﬃciency
of M2/M3 is always higher than M1. In the silicon target, the M1 eﬃciency
is above 10% for the energy below 10 MeV and signiﬁcantly drops to ¡∼1%
for the neutron energy larger than 10 MeV. The M2/M3 eﬃciency is a few
factors larger than the M1 eﬃciency for the energy below 10 MeV and about
one order larger than the M1 eﬃciency for the energy above 10 MeV.

6

The eﬃciency also signiﬁcantly depends on the target density.

In the
LHe target, the eﬃciency is larger than 10% for the energy below 20 MeV
and signiﬁcantly drops for the energy above 20 MeV. The M2 eﬃciency is
slightly larger than the M1 eﬃciency for the energy lower than 20 MeV but
signiﬁcantly larger for the energy above 20 MeV. The eﬃciency of the gas
helium target of 50 bar is at least 1 order smaller than the liquid helium
target, and the eﬃciency of the gas helium of 10 bar is much smaller. The
pattern of the eﬃciency is consistent with the cross section used in the MCNP
and calculated by TALYS.

Figure 4 shows that most scattering events can be detected by the 10
cm Si cube. Figure 5(a) shows that the mean distances of AC and AB in
a silicon cube are about 4 to 6 cm and 2 to 3 cm, respectively, which is a
reasonable value considering a 10 cm3 cube. The scattering scale in a Si
target is consistent within 10 cm, which is about the size of the silicon pixel
detectors that we can construct. Figure 5(b) shows the mean distance of AC
and AB in a 4He cube in diﬀerent states, including liquid, gas of 50 bar, and
gas of 10 bar. The scattering scale in a He target is consistent within 1 m,
which is about the size of common liquid helium Dewars.

Figure 6 shows the distribution of the time τ1. Figure 7 shows the average
time τ1. The time between the vertex A and B depends on the neutron
velocity and the distance between A and B. Since the distance is roughly a
constant, as shown in Figure 5, the time is roughly linearly dependent on the
beam energy in the log scale. In order to measure τ1, it is necessary to have
at least a time resolution of about 10−10 s for the silicon target and 10−9 s
for the helium target.

Figure 8 shows the distribution of the ion energy with the momentum
(cid:126)Q1 and (cid:126)Q2. Figure 9 shows the average ion energy with the momentum (cid:126)Q1
and (cid:126)Q2, which is equal to the neutron deposit energy. Neutrons can deposit
more energy in the elastic scattering in the 4He target than the silicon target
because of the lighter mass of 4He. The deposit energy scale due to the
elastic scattering is about 0.2 MeV and below in the silicon target and about
10 MeV and below in the 4He target. Higher deposited energy can induce
nuclear reactions other than the elastic scattering, e.g., inelastic scattering.
Figure 10 shows the distribution of the cos Θ1. Figure 11 shows the cos Θ
of Θ1 and Θ2. While the beam energy is below 1 MeV, the mean of cos Θ is
close to zero, i.e., the elastic scattering can be any angle. When the beam
energy increases above 1 MeV, the mean of cos Θ is positive, i.e., the angle is
less than 90◦ and the scattered particle tends to move forward. For the beam

7

energy larger than 100 MeV, cos Θ ∼ 1, which means that the scattering
angles are extremely small and the scattered particles just ﬂy forward. Any
reﬂection will deposit enormous energy and generate nuclear reactions other
than elastic scattering. Figure 2 also shows the same pattern as isotropic
scatter for low-energy neutrons and forward scatter for high-energy neutrons.
Figure 12 shows the reconstructed beam momentum p0 using Equations (6)

and (9) and the reconstructed beam kinetic energy Ek,0, where
Ek,0 = E0 − mnc2 = (cid:112)(mnc2)2 + (p0c)2 − mnc2

(16)

using the M1 and M2. The reconstructed beam kinetic energy is exactly
equal to the input beam energy with a small error bar. This demonstrates
that M1 needs A, B, C, (cid:126)Q1, and (cid:126)Q2, M2 needs A, B, (cid:126)Q1, and τ1, and M3
needs A, B, Ek,Q1, and τ1 to derive the initial beam momentum.

5. Ion Range

Figure 5 shows the mean free path scale λ of the neutron elastic collision
around 5 cm in the silicon and 50 cm in the 4He. We also need to understand
the ion travel range L in order to estimate the position resolution of the
detector. As shown in Figure 9, the silicon ion energy is about from 10 keV
to 200 keV for the neutron energy from 100 keV to 10 MeV and above, and
the 4He ion energy is about from 10 keV to 10 MeV for the neutron energy
from 100 keV to 100 MeV and above. However, there is no ion information
saved in PTRAC. Here, we apply the software of The Stopping and Range
of Ions in Matter (SRIM) [3] to calculate the ion range for given energies, as
shown in Figure 13. Silicon ions can only travel around 0.01 µm for the ion
energy around 10 keV and 0.3 µm for the ion energy around 200 keV. 4He
ions with energy 1 MeV can travel 40 µm in liquid helium, 700 µm in gas
helium of 50 bar, and 3 mm in gas helium of 10 bar. Therefore, the scale of
L is about from 10 nm to 10 mm, depending on the targets and the neutron
energy. Figure 9 also shows the ion longitudinal straggling range δLsl and
the ion lateral straggling range δLst, which are about from nm to mm, about
1 order smaller than L. The detector position resolution must match at least
the scale of δLsl and δLst. Since the 4He position resolution is about 100
µm, Figure 13 shows that gaseous 4He time projection chambers (TPC) will
be ideal for ion tracking as well as tracking fast neutrons, which has been
discussed in Ref. [1]. However, TPC could be expensive to construct and

8

implement. On the other hand, silicon pixel detectors are promising for ion
tracking with high-energy neutrons and, in particular, if micron-size pixels
and voxels, which would be available in 1 cm3 formats [6]. Additionally, the
ion energy range with the silicon target is above keV in Figure 13 and the
timescale is above 0.1 nanosecond in Figure 7. The energy and the time are
about the proper scale for silicon pixel detectors. Therefore, the silicon pixel
detectors can be used to measure neutrons with M3 as well. When designing
a neutron tracking detector, this should be considered in designs. Diﬀerent
solid-state detectors are also investigated in Refs.

[7, 8].

6. Conclusions

In this paper, we use MCNP to simulate the successive elastic neutron
scattering in the natural silicon and 4He targets and demonstrate the robust-
ness of tracking fast neutrons. The eﬃciency can be as large as 10% for the
neutron energy less than 10 MeV, but much smaller for high-energy neutrons
for the moderate-size cube detectors less than 1 m3. The ion travel range
around mm is suitable for gaseous TPC detectors while the ion travel range
around µm is only good for the silicon pixel detectors with high-energy neu-
trons. Gaseous TPC will be ideal for the fast neutron tracking; however, it
could be expensive to construct and implement. Depending on the applica-
tion of the detector, solid-state pixelated detectors can be useful for the fast
neutron tracking, especially if high-position resolution around 1 micron can
be achievable. At least three diﬀerent methods to measure the initial neutron
energy and direction can be applied for two diﬀerent kinds of detectors, de-
pending on the constraints of the detectors and the experimental conditions.
A possible silicon pixel detector for the neutron tracking measurement will
be constructed and investigated in the future.
