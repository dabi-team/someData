Abstract—Due to the established energy production methods
contribution to the climate crisis, renewable energy is to replace
a substantial part of coal or nuclear plants to prevent greenhouse
gases or toxic waste entering the atmosphere. This relatively
quick shift in energy production, primarily pushed by increasing
political and economical pressure, requires enormous effort on
the part of the energy providers to balance out production
ﬂuctuations. Consequently, a lot of research is conducted in the
key area of stochastic unit commitment (UC) on electrical grids
and microgrids. The term unit commitment includes a large
variety of optimization techniques, and in this paper we will
review recent developments in this area. We start by giving
an overview over different problem deﬁnitions and stochastic
optimization procedures, to then assess recent contributions to
this topic. We therefore compare the proposals and case studies
of several papers.

I. INTRODUCTION

than ever. The energy market

Since the advent of renewable energy sources the need
for scheduling power production and energy distribution has
become more important
is
shifting from inﬂexible power production with coal or nuclear
power plants to the highly ﬂuctuant wind or solar energy plants
that require more ﬂexible control mechanisms [1]. Especially
grid balancing, which includes controlling available generation
units and prediction of energy production and load, is an
increasingly difﬁcult
task, due to the stochastic nature of
renewable resources [2]. The process used by power generation
companies to create predictions about the energy production
needs days or weeks ahead of time is called unit commitment
(UC) [1]. The actual real time allocation of units minutes or
hours before is referred to as economic dispatch (ED). The
focus of this review lies on the prior research topic.

UC decisions deﬁne, for each time step over a schedul-
ing horizon, which generation unit should be used, while
accounting for market clearing, reliability assessment, intra-
day operations, expected load and operational policies [1], [3].
Energy grids mainly comprise multiple distributed generation
resources, electric storage resources and loads. [4]. Resource
generation units can generally divided into several groups:
thermal generation resources (TGR) like coal or nuclear,
renewable resources (RR) like wind and solar, and resource
storage, like batteries or gas storage. There are many groups
try to solve the complex
of optimization algorithms that

production and demand balancing. [1] Since many parameters
of energy production are uncertain, especially with wind and
solar, stochastic optimization methods are a popular choice to
optimize for cost, reliability, equipment failure and more [5].
UC therefore represents a optimization problem under con-
straints and uncertainty. UC is proven to be an NP-hard
problem [1]. In this review we compare three approaches to
solve the UC problem: stochastic programming (SP), stochas-
tic dynamic programming (SDP) and distributionally robust
optimization (DRO). The paper is structured as follows.
In Section II we deﬁne the basic objective of SO problems in
UC. We summarize various approaches to solve UC. There-
after, in Sections III, IV and V, we review different DRO,
SP and SDP models, respectively. To evaluate performance,
the case studies are analyzed. Section VI the advantages and
disadvantages of the optimization techniques are evaluated.
A short discussion regarding future development is held in
Section VII, with a focus on incorporating green house gas
emissions in UC.

In the next section we give an overview over the different

UC modeling and solving approaches.

II. STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS

The term ’stochastic optimization’ includes a variety of
optimization techniques. When applied to UC for power grids,
the problem can be deﬁned as an optimization of an objective
function under a set of constraints [2]. Underlying the function
parameters are probability distributions, which in case of
stochastic programming are assumed to be known prior to
realization [3].

To formalize the problem, we need to give an overview of
suitable methods to model the uncertainty of the problem ﬁrst.
UC models are often deﬁned as two-stage models. The ﬁrst
stage contains commitment decisions u, while dispatch deci-
sions are incorporated in the second stage after the uncertain
parameters are realized [5]. In two stage models the objective
function is often quadratic or piecewise linear [5]. Uncertainty
is realized only once [1].

Multistage models also exist, where commitment decisions
are modeled as nodes of a scenario tree [5]. Uncertainty
can therefore be realized over time, decisions can hence
be adjusted dynamically [1]. Therefore, these models deﬁne
the uncertain future as a scenario tree that includes many
possible simulated outcomes [1]. This method is common for

 
 
 
 
 
 
stochastic programming solutions. The scenario tree can be
searched using Monte Carlo simulations [2]. A disadvantage
of this technique is the exponentially increasing computational
complexity when growing the number of modeled scenarios
[2]. In [5], algorithms used to cope with these enormous
scenario trees are listed, among them for example Benders
decomposition, Lagrangian relaxation, dual decomposition or
Progressive hedging as used in [6]. The latter approach will
be explored in more detail later on. It is also possible to use
uncertainty sets or probabilistic constraints. Uncertainty sets
are often used to model uncertainty for robust optimization
models [1]. Conﬁdence intervals are the most basic uncertainty
sets, they are deﬁned by the sample mean and quantiles of an
according distribution [7]. A general deﬁnition of some SP
solving approaches can be found in [1]. The authors show
that stochastic programming models often take the form

min
u∈U

c⊺u + Eξ[F (u, ξ)]

(1)

where u are the commitment decisions of slow reacting power
units like coal and nuclear and U is the set of feasible com-
mitment decisions, startup and shutdown costs are represented
by the vector c and ξ is a vector of uncertain parameters
drawn from a known probability distribution [1]. The ﬁrst term
therefore models day-ahead planning, which includes rather
unresponsive commitment decisions e.g. of TGR generators
like coal and nuclear, while the second term models real
time decisions [1]. The latter ED phase is needed to adjust
for ﬂuctuations of renewable energy production or outages.
While stochastic programming models have the advantage of
cost saving and reliability improvements when compared to
simply using reserve constraints [1], a major drawback is the
assumption that the distribution of the data points used for the
model is known a priori [3]. In realistic scenarios, this is often
not the case.

Another wide spread technology is robust optimization
(RO) [7]. Robust optimization models uncertainty through
uncertainty sets. This method bases its decisions on the worst
case outcome, its predictions are therefore rather conservative
[7] [3]. The general robust optimization problem is deﬁned as

min
u∈U

c⊺u + max
v∈V

[F (u, v)]

(cid:26)

(2)

(cid:27)

where u and U are deﬁned analogous to (1), v again represents
the uncertainty parameter with deterministic uncertainty set
V [1]. The function F (u, v) models the real-time dispatch
cost for the decisions u and an uncertain variable v [1]. The
difference between the vectors v of SO and RO is that while
for SO the vector represents a vector of uncertain parameters,
for RO it is a variable vector. For the latter, v needs to be
adjusted to minimize the worst scenarios total cost [1].

In both SP and RO models second stage problem, function
F represents a minimization task. The problem deﬁnition is

very similar in both methods, as shown in [1], where the
general SP function is deﬁned as

F (u, s) = min
ps,fs

f (ps)

s.t. Asu + Bsps + Hsfs ≥ ds

(3)

(4)

for each realization s of random vector ξ, and the RO function
as

q⊺p

F (u, v) =min
p, f
s.t. Avu + Bvp + Hvf ≥ dv

(5)

(6)

In (3) Matrices As, Bs, Hs usually model contingencies,
while ds models uncertain demand and renewable energy
outputs [1]. Vectors ps, fs model dispatches and reserves of
multiple periods and other second stage decisions, respectively
[1]. Function f models fuel cost and is usually quadratic
and non-convex. The variables and parameters are similarly
deﬁned in (5), with the only difference that
the matrices
and vectors are functions of the uncertain parameters, and
the objective function uses piecewise linear approximation
with coefﬁcient vector q to approximate the original SO cost
function f [1].

in that

A newer optimization method, the distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) could solve the problems of RO and
SO [3], [7]. DRO takes into account the shortcomings of
RO,
it considers the uncertainty of the parameter
probability distribution [3]. The probability distributions here
belong to ambiguity sets that are constructed from historical
data using methods like Kullback-Leibler divergence, moment
information or the Wasserstein distance [3].

SDP solves the problem by breaking it down into a sequence
of steps over time [2]. In [1], a general ﬁnite-horizon, discrete-
time SDP framework is deﬁned as follows:

T −1

Vπ(s0) := E

inf
π∈Π

"

t=0
X

Ct(st, µt(st), ξt) + CT (uT )

#

.

(7)

Here, ξt are random variables, Ct(·) models system cost at
time period t, and Vπ is referred to as the value function. st is
the state of a system at time period t, ut are the commitment
and dispatch decisions according to policy function µ(·) which
maps from system state st At each time step, the best route is
found based on the possible optimum subsequences in the pre-
vious step [2]. The main advantage of dynamic programming
(DP) is that it can maintain the feasibility of the solution, as
it is able to ﬁnd the optimal subsequence while searching for
the optimal sequence [2].

In the following sections we will summarize several papers

using the previously listed methods.

III. DISTRIBUTIONALLY ROBUST OPTIMIZATION

In [3], the authors present a distributionally robust optimiza-
tion (DRO) technique that minimizes the expected cost from
the worst case scenario over an ambiguity set of probability
distributions constructed by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.

Kullback-Leibler divergence is a measure of distance be-
tween probability distributions [7]. The nominal distribution
P0 can be constructed using parametric methods like max-
imum likelihood estimators or non-parametric methods. The
latter are often used to handle data driven problems, because
they do not assume anything about the underlying datapoint
distribution [7].

The DRO approach is applied to microgrids and incorpo-
rates the evaluation of microgrid net load uncertainty and
electricity market prices [3]. The proposed approach is mod-
eled as a two-stage problem, where the ﬁrst stage determines
the binary commitment and startup variables of the thermal
generation resources (TGR) over a set period, incorporating
typical TGR constraints like uptime and downtime [3]. The
uncertain net load and the electricity price are not realized
yet, since the objective of the ﬁrst stage is to minimize ﬁxed
costs and worst case expected power costs. The second stage
problem minimizes the power generation and purchase costs.
It is constrained by the TGR output limits, up/-downtime
constraints and power balancing. The authors decided to model
the uncertainty through ambiguity sets, which is a common
choice for RO models [1].

The ambiguity set P in [3] is constructed with KL diver-

gence through k-means clustering and is deﬁned as

S

P := {P :

πω
P log

Divergence tolerance ρ is used to adjust the ambiguity set size
and therefore its conservatism [3]. ω represents a cluster, clus-
ter centroids represent realizations ξω. Scenario ω has nominal
probability πω
Po for the nominal probability distribution Po.
The number of scenarios is denoted as S. The resulting KL
divergence based microgrid UC (KL-MUC) is reformulated
to a convex mixed integer non-linear problem (RKL-MUC)
deﬁned as follows:

RKL-MUC :

(x, µ, ζ) = Q(x,ξ

where X represents the feasibility region of x deﬁned by the
)−µ
ﬁrst stage problem constraints, and K
[3]. Q(x, ξω) is a function of the uncertain power generation
and purchase cost for variable x and realization ξω of un-
certain values [3]. Dual variables ζ, µ are are assigned to the
constraints (8) and (9), respectively [3]. Constraint (8) controls
the divergence between Po and distribution P incorporated
into ambiguity set P based on KL divergence, (9) ensures

ω

the sum of probabilities assigned by P is one [3]. The RKL-
MUC problem is solved using an algorithm based on Benders
decomposition, where it is decomposed into a lower bounding
master problem and an upper bounding subproblem [3]. The
approach enables hedging against adopting misrepresenting
probability distributions [3]. When benchmarked against a
SUC problem equivalent to the formulation of KL microgrid
unit commitment problem that
is solved by the L-shaped
algorithm, the total cost of RKL-MUC is observed to be less
than or equal to the cost under the SUC formulation [3].
Furthermore, while both problem formulations give similar
results when divergence parameter ρ = 0, the total cost of
the RKL-MUC solution gets smaller compared to the SUC
solution. The authors state that this result can be traced back
to the fact that it is beneﬁcial to take additional probability
distributions other than the nominal distribution into account
[3].

Later in [8], Yurdakul et al. further build on their previous
research in distributionally robust unit commitment under net
load uncertainty using KL divergence. Improvements in the
short term planning are achieved by reformulation of the KL
distrubutionally robust unit commitment (KL-DRUC), obtain-
ing a convex mixed-integer nonlinear reformulated KL-DRUC
(RKL-DRUC) problem where the objective function is deﬁned
in a similar way as the objective function (11) of the previous
paper, with the difference of more constraints incorporated and
the focus shifted from microgrids to power systems under net
load uncertainty in general [8]. Using a similar SUC model
as the previous paper, the focus here lies on investigating the
inﬂuence of different k-means clustering distance measures,
the size of the dataset used for ambiguity set construction and
the inﬂuence of different values of divergence parameter ρ on
the results [8]. Furthermore, more constraints are incorporated
into the second stage, namely the load curtailment cost,
ramping constraints [8]. The authors this time present the
solution in the form of a real world data case study, where net
load values of the California System Operator Grid are used.
To gain an insight into the impact of ρ, the authors optimize
the model for different values and different distance functions.
A increase in total cost can be observed for larger values of
ρ for all tested distance measures. Furthermore, a coupling
between optimal cost and number of datapoints can be noted,
in that the total cost decreases with an increasing count of
time-series data points. The research provided in this paper
could aid grid operators with the UC decision process for grids
with an increasing amount of renewable energy generators.

IV. STOCHASTIC PROGRAMMING

A classical SP approach can be found in [9]. The authors
provide a method to integrate stochastic solar power into
power grids. The ﬁst stage solves the problem of UC and
economic dispatch based on predicted solar power generation.
The second stage handles thermal generation rescheduling
when solar power is generated. In order to cope with over-
estimation of solar production, additional reserve purchasing
is included in the model. All in all, the model is constrained

by power balance, minimum/maximum generation, operating
reserve, ramp rate, up-/downtime, operating costs and reserve
buying/penalty costs. The objective function to minimize is
deﬁned as

T

min

(St+ES(Os,t(˜ppv,s,t, ˜ps,t, ut))+

t=1
X

ES(ωt|˜ppv,s,t − ˜Ppv,s,t|)),

(15)

(16)

where ut are the UC decisions of thermal units, ˜pt, ˜ppv,s,t
are the scheduling decisions depending on the actual and
stochastic solar power generation. P pv,s,t is a stochastically
simulated scenario and decision variables with subscript s
are the corresponding scheduling decisions in a scenario s.
ES is an approximation to expected value E with S solar
power scenarios. St is the startup cost. The model is tested
on a simulation containing several loads and generators, solar
and thermal [9]. When comparing the proposed method to
deterministic or robust optimization, a signiﬁcant improvement
can be noticed [9]. With all three methods, the average cost
rises with rising solar uncertainty due to over-scheduling
or penalty cost, but the stochastic approach stays relatively
constant in comparison to the other models [9]. Especially
the deterministic model suffers from this uncertainty [9]. The
robust model is only slightly worse than the stochastic model,
because its decisions are based on the worst case scenario and,
as mentioned earlier, therefore rather conservative [9].

When using ambiguity sets constructed from observed real
world data as in [8], DRO still has a main advantage over
SP methods. SP can potentially suffer from an inaccurate
distribution of uncertain parameters [7]. Of course, even the
distribution of the observed data in the ambiguity set can differ
from the underlying real distribution when measurement errors
occur, but in reality the obtained distribution is often close to
the ground truth [7]. The disadvantage of distance based DRO
is the high complexity of the problem, as the objective function
of these problems are often non-linear [7]. To counteract
this problem, in [7], the authors propose a distance based
distributionally robust unit commitment model (DB-DRUC)
based on KL divergence, that is reformulated into a mixed
integer non-linear programming problem (RDB-DRUC). The
RDB-DRUC model is scenario based and is deﬁned as

α is derived from the dual transformation [7]. RDB-DRUC is
a large-scale mixed integer non-linear problem that can be
decomposed using generalized Benders Decomposition [7].
The resulting subproblem can be further decomposed into
a second level master- and subproblem that can be solved
seperately [7]. In general the RDB-DRUC model outperforms
the robust UC (RUC) counterpart, as shown in the case study
[7]. As η → ∞, RDB-DRUC performance is equal to basic
RUC, for all other values it is less conservative [7]. The authors
further show that, by parallelizing the optimization task with
four threads, the solution of the second level problem can be
sped up by about 65% [7]. From experiments with real world
data it can be concluded that the model scales well even with
high scenario counts [7].

Parallelization as in [7] is not always easy to achieve. In
[6], a stochastic UC model for electric-gas coupled grids is
proposed. Coupled systems often pose a heavy computational
burden for traditional UC methods, since scenario indepen-
dent variables can be correlated across scenarios when using
algorithms like Benders Decomposition [6]. For this reason,
parallelizing these algorithms is difﬁcult. The authors therefore
apply a modiﬁed progressive hedging (MPH) algorithm to ac-
celerate the SUC optimization performance. The model for the
electricity-gas coupled system includes wind power and gas
ﬂow scenarios. The objective function to minimize is deﬁned
as the total cost over a time horizon t ∈ T and scenarios
sc ∈ SC. Gas system constraints include gas well production
limit, storage capacities, injection and withdrawal limits and
storage level variation time [6]. A signiﬁcant optimization
acceleration is achieved when compared to commercial al-
gorithms through uniform decomposition of the stochastic
model with the modiﬁed progressive hedging algorithm, which
can run on parallel hardware [6]. In the case study, up to
four workers are used in parallel [6]. Furthermore, instead of
piecewise linear function approximation, second-order cone
relaxation is applied to model gas ﬂow [6]. These changes
are tested in the case study. The MPH algorithm is compared
to several other optimization techniques, the most interesting
for out purpose being Deterministic UC and SUC solved
using Benders decomposition. While deterministic UC only
needs a short amount of time to converge to a solution, the
expected cost is in some cases more then ten times higher than
with the other approaches [6]. The Benders decomposition
SUC approach converges to a similar expected cost as the
is outperformed by MPH with
MPH SUC model, but
computational speeds being up to 17 times faster in some cases
due to the ability to be run in parallel [6].

V. STOCHASTIC DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

In an attempt to improve UC modeling under renewable
generation uncertainty through SDP, the authors in [10] pro-
pose a SDP based reformulation of multi-stage UC. To opti-
mize the model, an algorithm called Stochastic Dual Dynamic
integer Programming (SDDiP) is used. SDDiP is a sampling
based algorithm and is scalable to even large-scale scenario
trees [10]. The authors propose several approaches to improve

performance of SDDiP, a leveling method for Lagrangian cuts,
a hybrid model approach to faster approximate the expected
cost-to-go function in each stage and backwards parallelization
to compute multiple scenario problems at once [10]. After all
the applied performance enhancements, the authors are able
to show that the proposed algorithm handles multistage UC
problems with a large number of scenarios [10]. All of the
proposed improvements on the SDDiP algorithm are tested
separately [10]. Applying all those performance improvements
and running the algorithm on 32 threads ultimately results in
a speedup ratio of 4.8 and an efﬁciency of 15% on average
[10].

Instead of trying to handle a large amount of scenarios
through advanced algorithms, there is also the option to use
probabilistic constraints instead. Nguyen et al. propose in [2] a
new battery operating cost model that considers battery cycle
life and charge and discharge efﬁciencies of batteries. To relax
hard power balancing constraints, a probabilistic constraint
is used that incorporates all random variables of renewable
energy generation and loads [2]. One of the main achievements
of the authors is to make economic dispatch possible for
several batteries without introducing more objective functions
to solve to the problem [2]. The main advantage of the
proposed method is that it accurately computes the actual
performance of the energy storage system performance, so
resources can be managed better [2]. The SUC is deﬁned to
minimize expected operation cost of a microgrid over a time
horizon [2]. The objective function is

N

min C =

(Fk + Sk)

Xk=1

Fk = E{Fg,k + F d

b,k + F c

b,c + Fm,k}

(22)

(23)

where N is the time horizon, T the time step, Fk the total
expected operation cost in period k, Sk the total transition
cost which accounts for the start-up and shut-down cost of
the generators in period k [2]. Fg,k is the total operation cost
of generators during period k, F d
b,k represents (dis-) charging
batteries, Fm,k is the cost due to power mismatch [2]. The
developed case study models a rural or developing nation
microgrid which consists of batteries and wind, photovoltaic
and diesel generators [2]. The study shows that the stochastic
model can handle different load and generation scenarios well
[2]. It better models the performance of energy storage systems
and therefore better allocates resources that a deterministic
model [2]. It is further shown that batteries provide a more cost
effective choice than diesel generators, therefore increasing the
energy storage system size can provide economic advantages
[2].

VI. OPTIMIZATION PARADIGM COMPARISON

In real world use cases of electricity grid balancing, RO
is still the most widely used method of optimization [1].
This mostly comes down to the simplicity of implementation
and intuitiveness of this approach. While SP and SDP show
promising results, in some cases outperforming RO [9], large

scenario trees and therefore long optimization times hinder
wide spread adoption of these models. In addition, the com-
plexity of the applied hedging algorithms to cope with these
large scenario trees, as in [10] and [7], can be discouraging
to power generation companies. DRO here has an advantage
over the stated methods. It builds on the well researched
foundations of RO, but provides more realistic results due
to the use of ambiguity sets [1]. The conservativeness can
be controlled to some extent, as shown in [8], and DRO
solutions do not suffer as much from inaccurate distributions of
uncertain parameters as SP and SDP methods [7]. DRO further
beneﬁts from the fact that that the underlying probability
distributions of the model parameters do not need to be
determined a priori [8].

VII. RENEWABLE ENERGY OUTLOOK

While the reviewed papers all provide improvements to
models incorporating renewable energy uncertainty, they do
not take additional costs like green house gas emissions and
the associated rising environmental taxes into account. This
can be important, as can be seen in [4], where environmental
unit commitment (EUC) is proposed to incorporate carbon tax
payments into account. EUC therfore also minimizes green
house gas emissions. The performed case study clearly shows
the advantages of EUC over CUC. It is shown that for varying
carbon tax rates, EUC outperforms CUC even in scenarios
where the tax is low. This is due to the increased cost of TGR
generation which can only be incorporated ex-post by CUC.
Applying the modiﬁcations to other models can help to more
realistically predict actual generation cost of green house gas
producting generation units. Yurdakul, Sivrikaya and Albayrak
plan to propose models incorporating the gained experience
[4]. We conclude that research in this area is still in progress.

VIII. CONCLUSION

In the preceding sections, we have seen several modern
stochastic approaches to the unit commitment problem. All
of the discussed papers provide relevant additions to the UC
problem. The main approaches we reviewed are DRO, SP and
DSP. We summarized several promising methods in the ﬁeld
of DRO, which propose multiple improvements to (micro) grid
operation, which will be increasingly important for the rising
share of renewable energy. As two stage models are still the
more viable and applied solution to SUC, we suggest that
the DRO approach is especially worth to do further research
in, since it improves the already common robust optimization
through the use of ambiguity sets. It is therefore well suited
to incorporate renewable generation uncertainty. All of these
advances help improving the efﬁciency of power production,
thus enabling a more sustainable future.
