ABSTRACT

A promising energy range to look for angular correlation between cosmic rays of extragalactic origin
and their sources is at the highest energies, above few tens of EeV (1 EeV ≡ 1018 eV). Despite the ﬂux
of these particles being extremely low, the area of ∼3,000km2 covered at the Pierre Auger Observatory,
and the 17-year data-taking period of the Phase 1 of its operations, have enabled us to measure the
arrival directions of more than 2,600 ultra-high energy cosmic rays above 32 EeV. We publish this data
set, the largest available at such energies from an integrated exposure of 122,000 km2 sr yr, and search
it for anisotropies over the 3.4π steradians covered with the Observatory. Evidence for a deviation in
excess of isotropy at intermediate angular scale, with ∼ 15◦ Gaussian spread or ∼ 25◦ top-hat radius,
is obtained at the 4 σ signiﬁcance level for cosmic-ray energies above ∼ 40 EeV.

1. INTRODUCTION

Cosmic rays are observed up to the astounding ener-
gies of more than 1020 eV, making them the most en-
ergetic particles known in the Universe. However, the
origin of these particles remains elusive. The search for
the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs),
at energies above a few EeV (1 EeV ≡ 1018 eV), is chal-
lenging since they are almost all charged particles and
thus deﬂected by the magnetic ﬁelds permeating the in-
terstellar, intra-halo and intergalactic media (see e.g.
Alves Batista et al. 2019, for an overview). These mag-
netic ﬁelds are diﬃcult to study and their modeling is far
from being complete. However, above a few tens of EeV,
the deﬂections could be small enough for cosmic rays to
retain some directional information on the position of
their sources, at least for nuclei with a suﬃciently small
charge (e.g. Erdmann et al. 2016; Farrar & Sutherland
2019).

The cosmological volume within which UHECR
sources should be sought is fortunately limited. Cos-

mic rays at EeV energies can interact with the photon
backgrounds populating intergalactic space, through the
so-called GZK eﬀect (Greisen 1966; Zatsepin & Kuz’min
1966). In particular, protons are expected to undergo
photo-pion production and nuclei photodissociation in-
teractions. The mean free path for energy losses depends
on the cosmic-ray mass and energy. At 100 EeV, the loss
length is of the order of 200 − 300 Mpc for proton and
iron and 3 − 6 Mpc for intermediate nuclei such as he-
lium and nitrogen (Allard 2012; see also Figure 6 from
Addazi et al. 2022 for a recent overview). Such short
distances mean that the sources of the highest-energy
cosmic rays must be in the local universe.

The recent detection by the Pierre Auger Collabora-
tion of a dipolar anisotropy in the arrival directions of
UHECRs with energies above 8 EeV is evidence that the
majority of UHECR sources are not in the Milky Way
(Pierre Auger Collaboration 2017a). The direction of
the dipole points ∼ 120◦ away from the Galactic center
and is instead consistent at the 2 σ level with the lo-
cal distribution of stellar mass (2MASS redshift survey,
Huchra et al. 2012), after accounting for the deﬂections
expected in the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld (Jansson & Far-
rar 2012). Even without relying on magnetic deﬂections,

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

the case for a density of UHECR sources following local
extragalactic structures is further strengthened by the
consistency at the 1 σ conﬁdence level (C.L.) between
the directions of the UHECR anti-dipole and of the Lo-
cal Void at equatorial coordinates (α, δ) = (294◦, 15◦) or
Galactic coordinates (l, b) = (51◦, −3◦) (Biteau 2021).
Combined with the growth of the dipole amplitude
with energy expected from the shrinking horizon out to
which extragalactic sources remain visible (Pierre Auger
Collaboration 2018a), the properties of the large-scale
anisotropy discovered by the Pierre Auger Collaboration
provide a growing body of evidence against a Galactic
origin of these cosmic rays. Which (classes of) extra-
galactic sources host UHECR accelerators nonetheless
remains an open question.

In this article, we update previous searches for
anisotropies at the highest energies (Pierre Auger Col-
laboration 2015a, 2018b) with an unprecedentedly large
data set. In particular, we exploit the entire Phase 1 of
the Pierre Auger Observatory, i.e. the phase preceding
the AugerPrime upgrade (Pierre Auger Collaboration
2016a). Important progress has been made on estimat-
ing the mass distribution of UHECRs using only the
surface detector of the Observatory with its full duty
cycle (see e.g. Pierre Auger Collaboration 2016b, 2017b;
Ave et al. 2017; Pierre Auger Collaboration 2021a,b).
However, the proposed methods are still not ready to
be employed in arrival-direction studies, e.g. by select-
ing only the candidate light nuclei which would be less
deﬂected by magnetic ﬁelds, should such a subsample
exist in the data set.
In the following, we then con-
sider, as in previous works, only the energy and arrival
direction of each event recorded with the Pierre Auger
Observatory over 17 years of operation.

The data set includes more than 2,600 events with
energies E ≥ 32 EeV and zenith angles up to 80◦, as de-
scribed in Section 2. The release of this data set comple-
ments the publication of the arrival directions of events
at energies between 4 and 8 EeV and above 8 EeV made
available in Pierre Auger Collaboration (2017a).1 The
choice of an energy threshold at 32 EeV for the present
release anticipates upcoming publications focused on
lower energy bins, namely 8−16EeV and 16−32EeV, as
investigated e.g. in Pierre Auger Collaboration (2018a)
and Pierre Auger Collaboration (2020a) where ∼ 1,500
and ∼ 2,000 events were studied above 32 EeV, respec-
tively.
In Section 3, we describe a ﬁrst set of analy-
ses that are not based on speciﬁc source models, i.e. a

78-data/4642-arrival-directions-8eev-science-2017

blind search for excesses in the sky, an autocorrelation
study and the search for correlations with the Galactic
and supergalactic planes as well as the Galactic cen-
ter. Section 4 is devoted to the comparison of UHECR
arrival directions with the expected ﬂux pattern from
speciﬁc classes of galaxies traced by their electromag-
netic emission, from radio wavelengths to gamma rays.
Finally, Section 5 is devoted to a more in-depth study of
the Centaurus region, which has intrigued the UHECR
community since the early days of the Pierre Auger Ob-
servatory (Pierre Auger Collaboration 2007).

To encourage further studies of the Phase 1 high-
energy data set, this article is accompanied with supple-
mentary materials. These include the data set itself in
Appendix A and the dedicated analysis software in Ap-
pendix B. Appendix C describes the catalogs of galaxies
used here.

2. THE DATA SET

The Pierre Auger Observatory (Pierre Auger Collab-
oration 2015b) is located in Argentina near the town
of Malarg¨ue. Stable data acquisition began on 1 Jan-
uary 2004. The Observatory is composed of a surface
detector (SD) made of 1,660 water-Cherenkov stations
distributed on a triangular grid overlooked with a ﬂuo-
rescence detector (FD). The FD consists of 27 telescopes
at four locations on the perimeter of the SD array.

Here, we analyse the events with reconstructed ener-
gies larger than 32EeV recorded with the SD array from
1 January 2004 to 31 December 2020. The SD is used
to sample secondary particles in air showers and has full
eﬃciency above 4 EeV with ∼ 100% duty cycle.

Events recorded with SD are reconstructed diﬀerently
based on their arrival direction in local coordinates:
events with zenith angles, θ, less than 60◦ are called
vertical events, while events arriving with zenith an-
gles from 60◦ to 80◦ are called inclined events. Ver-
tical events are included when the SD station with the
largest signal is surrounded by at least four active sta-
tions. This a priori condition is complemented by the
a posteriori requirement that the reconstructed core of
the shower falls within an elementary isosceles trian-
gle of active stations. These requirements ensure that
the footprint of the shower is well-contained within the
array, with ample data for an accurate reconstruction
(Pierre Auger Collaboration 2010a). Inclined events, on
the other hand, are selected if the station closest to the
reconstructed core position is surrounded by at least ﬁve
active stations. Note that other analyses performed by
the Pierre Auger Collaboration at lower energies may
use a tighter selection. For example, the UHECR spec-
trum in Pierre Auger Collaboration (2020b) is measured

by requiring that all six active stations around the one
with the highest signal are active. We are able to use
a relaxed selection as the high-energy events included
here all have large footprints, with an average of 17.7
triggered stations. We inspected each event and veriﬁed
that the reconstruction was robust even with inactive
stations in the core region. With respect to previous
analyses, the identiﬁcation of active stations that were
not triggered has been improved to ensure a better se-
lection. This was done through an a posteriori check of
the consistency of the signal distribution at ground:
if
a station is not triggered in a region of the array where
the signal is more than twice that of the full trigger ef-
ﬁciency, which occurs for 11 events in the data set, the
station is classiﬁed as non-active at the moment of the
event (Pierre Auger Collaboration 2010a).

The selection results in 2,040 events with θ < 60◦ and
595 with θ ≥ 60◦ above 32 EeV.2 The exposure can be
computed in a geometrical way since we are operating
above the energy threshold for full eﬃciency for both
data samples (3 EeV for vertical and 4 EeV for inclined).
The geometrical exposure for the selection and time span
considered is 95,700 km2 sr yr for the vertical sample and
26,300 km2 sr yr for the inclined data set.

The reconstruction procedure for vertical events is de-
scribed in detail in Pierre Auger Collaboration (2020c).
The arrival direction is determined by ﬁtting a spherical
model to the arrival times of particles comprising the
shower front. For inclined events, the reconstruction
procedure is described in Pierre Auger Collaboration
(2014). The arrival direction is, in this case, obtained by
ﬁtting the arrival times with a front which takes into ac-
count the muon propagation from its production point.
For both data sets, the angular resolution, deﬁned as the
68% containment radius, is better than 1◦ at all energies
considered here.

The energy estimate is based on diﬀerent observables
for the two samples. The signal at a reference distance
of 1000 m from the shower core, S(1000), is used for
the vertical sample. The inclined reconstruction uses
as estimator N19, which represents the muon content of
the shower with respect to a reference simulated proton
shower with energy E = 1019 eV. For both samples, a
correction is applied to take into account the absorption
that showers undergo at diﬀerent zenith angles. This

2 To avoid border eﬀects at the zenith angle separating the inclined
and vertical selections, we identiﬁed events in the 60◦ < θ < 62◦
region that are well-reconstructed with the vertical procedure
but not included in the inclined data set and, vice-versa, events
in the 58◦ < θ < 60◦ region that are well-reconstructed with the
inclined procedure but not included in the vertical data set. We
found one event in the former case and none in the latter.

correction is performed through a data-driven procedure
called constant intensity cut, which is described in Pierre
Auger Collaboration (2020b). The constant-intensity-
cut method is used to convert S(1000) and N19 for each
shower to the value they would have if the same shower
had arrived from a reference zenith angle of 38◦ and
68◦ for vertical and inclined events, respectively. The
corrected energy estimators, S38 and N68, are then cal-
ibrated using hybrid events, i.e. events observed with
both the FD and the SD. Since the FD analysis enables
a quasi-calorimetric measurement of the shower energy,
the calibration procedure results in a reliable energy es-
timation for the whole SD data set without using air-
shower simulations. The systematic uncertainty in the
energy calibration is ∼ 14% while the energy resolution
for the SD at the energies considered here is ∼7% (Pierre
Auger Collaboration 2014, 2020d).

We checked the consistency between the vertical and
inclined data sets by comparing the ratio of number of
events in the two samples, Nincl/Nvert = 0.292 ± 0.014,
and the value expected from the ratio of geometrical
exposures, accounting for the ﬁnite energy resolution of
each data stream, ωincl/cincl(≥32 EeV)
ωvert/cvert(≥32 EeV) = 0.278. In the lat-
ter ratio, ω is the geometrical exposure for each data set,
which does not depend on energy, and c(≥ 32 EeV) ac-
counts for the net spillover of events from low to higher
energies (see the unfolding procedure described in Pierre
Auger Collaboration 2020b). The ratios are in agree-
ment at the 1 σ C.L., showing that the vertical and in-
clined samples can be used together. To keep the analy-
sis as data-driven as possible, we use the ratio of events
observed above 32 EeV as the expected exposure ratio
when constructing simulated data sets above any energy
threshold. It should be noted that at the highest ener-
gies probed here, E ≥ 80EeV, a deﬁcit of inclined events
is observed at a signiﬁcance level of 2.5 σ. A further dis-
cussion of this deﬁcit, which does not aﬀect the results
presented below, is provided in Appendix A together
with the information on how to access the data.

3. SEARCH FOR OVERDENSITIES AND
CORRELATION WITH STRUCTURES

An earlier wide-ranging search with the Observatory
for small- and intermediate-scale anisotropy was re-
ported in Pierre Auger Collaboration (2015a). Searches
for localized excesses in top-hat windows of angular ra-
dius Ψ across the entire ﬁeld of view of the Observatory,
or around the Galactic center, Centaurus A and can-
didate host galaxies identiﬁed in multi-wavelength sur-
veys, were performed by comparing the expected and
observed numbers of events within the window. Simi-
lar analyses were performed along the Galactic and su-

4

pergalactic planes, by counting the number of events
within an angle Ψ from these structures, and an auto-
correlation study exploited the number of pairs of events
separated by less than Ψ. The analyses were repeated
above energy thresholds ranging from 40 to 80 EeV. An
additional scan on the maximum distance of the sources
was performed for analyses against catalogs of candidate
host galaxies. Both scans in energy threshold and max-
imum distance were motivated by the limited horizon
from which UHECR can reach Earth, although the de-
termination of its observational value remains hindered
by uncertainties on UHECR composition.

In this Section, we update the results presented in
Pierre Auger Collaboration (2015a), with the exception
of the search for correlation with catalogs, which is per-
formed in Section 4.

3.1. Search for localized excesses

The ﬁrst analysis is a blind search for excesses over the
fraction of the sky covered with the Observatory. The
number of UHECRs detected in circular windows on the
sky (Nobs) is compared to that expected, in the same
window, from an isotropic distribution of events (Nexp).
This search is performed over the entire ﬁeld of view,
which covers about 85% of the sky. The search windows
are centered on a HEALPix grid (HEALPix v3.70, G´orski
et al. 2005), deﬁned by the parameter nSide = 64, which
sets the size of the pixels to be of the order of the angu-
lar resolution of the Observatory. Events are counted
within search windows of radius Ψ, ranging from 1◦
to 30◦ in 1◦ steps. Similarly, the search is performed
by selecting events above energy thresholds, Eth, rang-
ing from 32 EeV to 80 EeV in 1 EeV steps. For each
window and energy threshold, we estimate the binomial
probability of obtaining by chance Nobs or more events
from an isotropic distribution of data. The computa-
tion of Nexp is performed by simulating events with co-
ordinates distributed according to the sum of the ver-
tical and inclined exposures, weighted in proportion to
the observed number of events at energies above 32 EeV
(see Section 2). For each realization of the simulated
data set, the number of events is of the same size as
observed across the ﬁeld of view. Simulated events fol-
low the same energy distribution as the observed events.
Performing the analysis on simulated isotropic data sets
allows us to take into account the trial factors for having
tested diﬀerent directions, radii and energy thresholds.
We consider as post-trial probability the fraction of these
simulations with an equal or lower local p-value than the
best one obtained with the observed data set.

We also compute the local Li-Ma signiﬁcance (equa-
tion (17) in Li & Ma 1983) for each point in the sky,

Figure 1. Local Li-Ma signiﬁcance map at energies above
41 EeV and within a top-hat search angle Ψ = 24◦ in Galac-
tic coordinates. The supergalactic plane is shown as a gray
line. The signiﬁcance is not evaluated in windows whose
centers lie outside of the ﬁeld-of-view of the Observatory, as
indicated by the white area.

where the ON-region is centered on each point of the
HEALPix grid and the OFF-region is deﬁned as the re-
mainder of the ﬁeld of view. The local signiﬁcance map
is displayed in Galactic coordinates in Figure 1. The
most signiﬁcant excess, with 5.4 σ local signiﬁcance, is
found above an energy threshold of 41 EeV within a
top-hat window of 24◦ radius centered on equatorial co-
ordinates (α, δ) = (196.3◦, −46.6◦), which corresponds
to Galactic coordinates (l, b) = (305.4◦, 16.2◦). At this
position of the parameter space, 153 events are observed
when 97.7 are expected from isotropy. The local p-value
in this position is 3.7 × 10−8, resulting in a post-trial
p-value of 3%.

3.2. Autocorrelation

Another model-independent approach to assess the
clustering of events is the search for autocorrelation, i.e.
counting pairs of events separated by a given angular
distance. This approach is particularly eﬀective if the
events form multiple clusters on similar angular scales
in diﬀerent directions in the sky.

Following Pierre Auger Collaboration (2015a), we
count the number of event pairs, Nobs, above energy
thresholds ranging from 32 to 80 EeV, that are sepa-
rated by less than an angle Ψ ranging from 1◦ to 30◦ in
steps of 0.25◦ up to 5◦ and of 1◦ above. We compute the
expected number of pairs, Nexp, by analysing simulated
isotropic event sets of the same size as the observed data
set. For each Ψ and Eth, we consider as local p-value
the fraction of simulated data sets, f (Eth, Ψ), for which
Nexp ≥ Nobs. The values of f are shown in Figure 2(a)
and the best results are shown in Table 1.

the autocorrelation study, supergalactic-plane, Galactic-center and Galactic-plane searches, respectively. The most signiﬁcant
excess identiﬁed in each analysis is indicated with a white cross.

3.3. Correlation with structures

The most constrained analysis performed in this Sec-
tion is a search for correlation with local astrophysi-
cal structures. Although a Galactic origin of UHECRs
at energies above 8 EeV is disfavored by the large-scale
anisotropy discovered by the Collaboration, we test as
targets the Galactic plane and the Galactic center in
addition to the supergalactic plane, for consistency with
Pierre Auger Collaboration (2015a). The search is per-
formed in a similar way as the study described in Sec-
tion 3.2, with Nobs being the number of events observed
within an angle Ψ from the chosen structure. In prac-
tice, for the Galactic and supergalactic planes, we count
events with an absolute value of latitude smaller than Ψ
in the respective coordinate system.

The results are shown in Figure 2 and in Table 1.
The lowest p-values are found for Ψ (cid:46) 20◦ above energy
thresholds near ∼ 40 and ∼ 60 EeV. No signiﬁcant de-

parture from isotropy is observed in these searches, as
in Pierre Auger Collaboration (2015a).

4. LIKELIHOOD ANALYSIS WITH CATALOGS OF

CANDIDATE HOST GALAXIES

In Pierre Auger Collaboration (2015a), we presented
the results of cross-correlation studies with three ﬂux-
limited catalogs: the 2MASS Redshift Survey of near-
infrared galaxies (Huchra et al. 2012), the Swift-BAT 70-
month catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed
in hard X-rays (Baumgartner et al. 2013) and a catalog
of radio-emitting galaxies from van Velzen et al. (2012).
Such cross-correlation analyses inherently assume all
galaxies under investigation to have an equal weight
(standard-candle approach) and do not easily account
for the inverse-square law of the UHECR ﬂux, nor for
its attenuation resulting from energy losses induced by

propagation. These limitations were addressed in Pierre
Auger Collaboration (2018b) through a likelihood-ratio
test that expanded upon the maximum-likelihood test
presented in Pierre Auger Collaboration (2010b). We
also tested two additional catalogs based on gamma-
ray observations from Fermi -LAT. The full-sky gamma-
ray survey of Fermi -LAT has shown starforming galax-
ies and jetted AGN to be the main contributors to the
extragalactic gamma-ray background at GeV energies,
although their relative contributions remains uncertain
(see e.g. Ajello et al. 2015; Roth et al. 2021).

4.1. From catalogs to UHECR sky models

We ﬁrst explore correlations with the large-scale dis-
tribution of matter using the Two Micron All-Sky Sur-
vey (2MASS, Skrutskie et al. 2006). The expected
UHECR ﬂux in this scenario is traced by K-band obser-
vations at 2.16 µm, i.e. we assume an UHECR luminos-
ity proportional to stellar mass. We limit the study to
galaxies up to a K-band magnitude of 11.75 mag, which
corresponds to the ﬂux limit over more than 90% of the
2MASS Redshift Survey. We veriﬁed through the Hy-
perLEDA3 database (Makarov et al. 2014) that all the
selected objects are galaxies and we kept in the sample
AGN hosts, noting though that their near-infrared emis-
sion may be contaminated by non-thermal emission.

A second sample consists of galaxies with a high star-
formation rate, broadly denoted here as starburst galax-
ies. Lunardini et al. (2019) selected local galaxies with
a far-infrared ﬂux at 60 µm larger than 60 Jy from the
IRAS all-sky survey (Sanders et al. 2003) and with a ra-
dio ﬂux at 1.4 GHz larger than 20 mJy from the NVSS
(Condon et al. 1998) and Parkes surveys (Calabretta
et al. 2014) in the Northern and Southern hemispheres,
respectively. The authors also imposed a far-infrared to
radio ﬂux ratio larger than 30, which removes galaxies
dominated by jetted AGN emission. We further select

3 http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/

galaxies with a far-infrared to radio ﬂux ratio smaller
than 1000, which excludes dwarf galaxies with negligible
radio emission. The latter criterion removes the Large
and Small Magellanic Clouds from the sample of star-
burst galaxies in Lunardini et al. (2019), as these are
clear outliers of the ﬂux-ratio distribution. Although
the IRAS survey can safely be considered as ﬂux lim-
ited over the entire sky for ﬂuxes larger than 60 Jy, the
subtraction of the Galactic foreground is more demand-
ing in studies of extended radio sources down to 20 mJy.
Following their reanalysis of the Southern radio sky, Lu-
nardini et al. (2019) excluded areas close the Galactic
plane, which contain in particular the bright Circinus
galaxy at latitude l = −3.8◦. The latter galaxy satis-
ﬁes the above-mentioned selection criteria and we add
it to the sample using its radio ﬂux tabulated in the
Parkes catalog (Wright & Otrupcek 1996). The radio
ﬂux of galaxies in the sample is used as a tracer for
UHECR emission, eﬀectively assuming an UHECR lu-
minosity proportional to starforming activity.

The third sample encompasses AGNs observed in
hard X-rays with Swift-BAT, as tabulated in their 105-
month catalog (Oh et al. 2018). We select hard X-
ray sources with a 14 − 195 keV ﬂux larger than 8.4 ×
10−12 erg cm−2 s−1, which corresponds to the Swift-
BAT ﬂux limit over more than 90% of the sky. We
retain objects labeled as jetted AGN, Seyfert galaxies,
or other AGNs with or without jets. We adopt with this
catalog the hard X-ray ﬂux as a tracer for the UHECR
ﬂux, eﬀectively assuming that the UHECR luminosity
is driven by accretion onto super-massive black holes.
We note though that the X-ray ﬂux of the sub-sample
of radio-loud AGN, in particular that of blazars, is ex-
pected to be dominated by jet emission.

Finally, the fourth sample comprises γ-ray selected
AGN from the Fermi -LAT 3FHL catalog (Fermi-LAT
Collaboration 2017). We select radio galaxies and
blazars with an integral ﬂux between 10 GeV and 1 TeV
larger than 3.3 × 10−11 cm−2 s−1. Above this value, the
3FHL catalog is ﬂux-limited over 90% of the sky (97%

for Galactic latitudes |b| > 5◦).4 The γ-ray ﬂux is used
as UHECR proxy, eﬀectively assuming an UHECR lu-
minosity proportional to the inner jet activity.

The bands adopted to trace UHECR emission are
aﬀected by little absorption in the host galaxy and
along the line of sight but UHECRs suﬀer increasing en-
ergy losses and photo-dissociation with increasing travel
time. Robust estimates of the luminosity distances of
host galaxies are needed to account for the attenua-
tion of their relative UHECR ﬂux above a given energy
threshold. Putative sources within a few tens of Mpc
may in particular have a substantial impact on UHECR
anisotropies while their host galaxies are not in the Hub-
ble ﬂow, which would make their spectroscopic redshift
a biased distance estimate. We cross-matched all four
catalogs with the HyperLEDA database and adopted
the best distance estimate (modbest ﬁeld) and associ-
ated uncertainty, which account for peculiar motion and
exploit cosmic-distance-ladder estimates whenever avail-
able. Galaxies within 250 Mpc are retained in the sam-
ple and we exclude those located in the Local Group
through a cut at 1 Mpc. Nearby galaxies would oth-
erwise dominate sky models aimed at tracing UHECR
emission on larger scales. A smaller horizon at 130 Mpc
is considered for starburst galaxies, following the selec-
tion of Lunardini et al. (2019). We note that few (if any)
starforming galaxies within 130 − 250 Mpc are expected
to pass the radio and far-infrared ﬂux selection. All
26 jetted AGNs and 44 starburst galaxies in our sample
are included in HyperLEDA. The apparent total K-band
magnitude available in HyperLEDA (Kt ﬁeld) enables a
straightforward selection of 44,113 2MASS galaxies. We
identiﬁed 23 Swift-BAT AGN, among 523 host galaxies,
without a tabulated HyperLEDA distance that nonethe-
less show compatible redshift estimates (|∆z| < 0.002)
in NED5 and SIMBAD.6 The distances of these 23 galax-
ies are based on their NED spectroscopic redshifts (cor-
rected for the Local-Group infall to the Virgo cluster),
as tabulated in Appendix C.

As

in Pierre Auger Collaboration (2018b),
the
UHECR ﬂux expected from each host galaxy is increas-
ingly attenuated with increasing luminosity distance,
dL, following the best-ﬁt model of the spectrum and
composition data acquired at the Pierre Auger Obser-
vatory (Pierre Auger Collaboration 2017c, ﬁrst min-

imum obtained with the EPOS-LHC hadronic inter-
action model). The attenuation weights, a(dL), are
marginalized over distance uncertainty for the three cat-
alogs with less than 1,000 galaxies, with little impact on
the ﬁnal sky models. For the sake of computational in-
tensity, no marginalization over distance uncertainty is
performed for the fourth sample, made of more than
44,000 near-infrared galaxies, with negligible impact on
the ﬁnal results.

All four sky models represent signiﬁcant improve-
ments with respect to those studied in Pierre Auger Col-
laboration (2018b) from an astronomical point of view.
From a quantitative perspective, the improvement in sky
coverage and depth of the surveys yield an increase in
jetted AGN from 17 to 26 objects, in starburst galax-
ies from 23 to 44, in all AGNs from 330 to 523 and in
near-infrared galaxies from 41,129 to 44,113. The esti-
mation of distance uncertainties also provides a qualita-
tive improvement with respect to the study presented in
Pierre Auger Collaboration (2018b). It should be noted
though that the results are barely aﬀected by such im-
provements (see Section 4.3), suggesting that our previ-
ous analysis already accounted for suﬃciently complete
surveys from an astroparticle point of view.

We further evaluated in Pierre Auger Collaboration
(2015a) possible correlations with the catalog of van
Velzen et al. (2012). The latter compiles observations
at 1.4 GHz and 843 MHz of extended radio sources down
to a ﬂux limit corresponding to the ﬂux of Centaurus A
placed at 200 Mpc. Accounting for attenuation, the re-
sulting sky model is entirely dominated by the nearby
Centaurus A (distance of 3.68 ± 0.05 Mpc) and can thus
be considered as redundant with the ﬂux pattern ob-
tained with the Swift-BAT model (see Appendix C).
We thus limit the present study to the four sky mod-
els obtained from near-infrared emission of galaxies
(2MASS), radio emission from starburst galaxies, X-rays
from AGNs (Swift-BAT) and γ-rays from jetted AGNs
(Fermi -LAT).

4.2. Likelihood-ratio analysis

As in Pierre Auger Collaboration (2018b), the correla-
tion of UHECR arrival directions with the ﬂux pattern
expected from the catalogs is evaluated against isotropy
using a likelihood-ratio analysis. The model as a func-
tion of direction u is computed in equal-area bins on the
sphere using HEALPix v3.70 with the parameter nSide
= 64, as in Section 3.1.

The null hypothesis under investigation, H0, is that of
an isotropic ﬂux distribution. Accounting for the direc-
tional exposure of the array, ω(u), the isotropic model

8

for the UHECR count density reads

nH0(u) =

ω(u)
i ω(ui)

(cid:80)

,

(1)

which is normalized so that the sum over the HEALPix
pixels indexed over i and of direction ui is equal to one.
The alternative hypothesis, H1, in which H0 is nested,
is considered as the sum of an isotropic component and a
component derived from the tested catalog. The ampli-
tude of the latter component is a variable signal fraction,
α. The isotropic remainder accounts for faint or distant
galaxies not included in the catalogs or for a heavy nu-
clear component deﬂected away on large angular scales.
The model for the UHECR count density under H1 reads

nH1 (u) = (1 − α) × nH0(u) + α ×

(cid:80)

j sj(u; Θ)
(cid:80)

j sj(ui; Θ)

(cid:80)

, (2)

where the index j runs over the galaxies in the catalog.
The contribution to the UHECR ﬂux from each galaxy,
sj(u; Θ), is modeled as a von Mises-Fisher distribution
centered on the direction of the galaxy with a smear-
ing angle Θ. The amplitude of its contribution is pro-
portional to the electromagnetic ﬂux of the galaxy, φj,
accounting for attenuation as a function of luminosity
distance, a(dj), so that

sj(u; Θ) = ω(u) × φja(dj) × exp

(cid:32)

u · uj
2(1 − cos Θ)

(cid:33)

. (3)

The von Mises-Fisher distribution is maximum in the
direction of the galaxy of interest, uj, eﬀectively leav-
ing aside coherent deﬂections which remain under-
constrained by current models of the Galactic magnetic
ﬁelds (Erdmann et al. 2016). The smearing angle Θ,
equivalent to the 2D Gaussian extent in the small-angle
limit, is assumed to be the same for all galaxies in a
given catalog. This parameter accounts for the average
angular dispersion in intervening magnetic ﬁelds. As a
note, the normalization of the von Mises-Fisher distri-
bution in equation (3) is omitted, as it is the same for
every galaxy and as the overall anisotropic component
is normalized on the sphere (see equation (2)).

The likelihood-ratio test between the nested models
H0 and H1 deﬁnes the test statistic, TS = 2 ln(L1/L0),
where the likelihood scores of the null and alternative
hypothesis, L0 and L1, are obtained as the product over
the events of the models nH0 and nH1, respectively. The
evaluation of the test statistic is performed by grouping
events by HEALPix bin. With an observed event count
ki in the direction ui, the test statistic is evaluated as

TS = 2

(cid:88)

i

ki × ln

nH1 (ui)
nH0 (ui)

.

(4)

The test statistic is maximized as a function of the
two free parameters in the analysis (the search radius,
Θ, and the signal fraction, α) above successive energy
thresholds. The maximization can be achieved by scan-
ning the 2D parameter space by steps of 0.2% in sig-
nal fraction and 0.2◦ in search radius. This approach
provides an accurate estimate that is independent from
any speciﬁc maximization algorithm. Alternatively, a
maximization with the Minuit package provides a fast
estimate for simulated data sets, with an accuracy on
TS better than 0.1 units for event counts larger than
100. Above a ﬁxed energy threshold, the test statistic
is observed through Monte Carlo simulations to follow
a χ2 distribution with two degrees of freedom under the
null hypothesis (Wilks 1938). The 1 and 2 σ C.L. on
the best-ﬁt parameters are set by iso-TS contours dif-
fering from the maximum TS value by 2.3 and 6.2 units,
respectively.

The scan in energy threshold is accounted for, as in
Section 3, by estimating the post-trial p-value through
isotropic Monte Carlo simulations. The post-trial p-
value, which accounts for the energy scan, diﬀers from
the local p-value expected from Wilks’ theorem by a
penalty factor that is well-approximated by a linear
function of TS: pen = 1+(0.30±0.01)×TS. This empir-
ical penalty factor is estimated from simulated isotropic
data sets analyzed against each catalog and the uncer-
tainty on the linear coeﬃcient is estimated from the vari-
ance across the four tested catalogs. The penalty factor
reaches a value of ∼ 10 for TS = 30.

4.3. Results

The search radius and signal fraction maximizing the
test statistic above ﬁxed energy thresholds ranging in
32–80 EeV are displayed in Figure 3 for the four cat-
alogs. The test statistic follows a double hump struc-
ture as a function of energy, with a ﬁrst peak at en-
ergies above ∼ 40 EeV and a second peak at energies
above ∼ 60 EeV. The latter peak corresponds to the
maximum signal fraction for all catalogs, ranging in 11–
19%. Lower signal fractions ranging in 6–16% are in-
ferred from the global TS maximum, at energies above
∼ 40 EeV. As shown in the upper axis in Figure 3, the
four times larger number of events in the ﬁrst peak
(1,387 above 40 EeV vs 331 above 60 EeV) yields a more
signiﬁcant deviation from isotropy above 40 EeV.

The amplitude of variations of the best-ﬁt parame-
ters as function of energy threshold can be evaluated
against the statistical uncertainties on these parameters,
as shown in Figure 4. As the search is performed above
successive energy thresholds by steps of 1 EeV, succes-
sive energy bins have a non-negligible overlap. For refer-

9

For the sake of completeness, we provide the best-ﬁt
parameters and maximum test statistic obtained above
energy thresholds corresponding to the global maximum
at E (cid:38) 40 EeV, in the upper part of Table 2, as well as
those obtained above the secondary maximum identi-
ﬁed at E (cid:38) 60 EeV, in the lower part of the same table.
The most signiﬁcant departure from isotropy is iden-
tiﬁed for all four catalogs at energy thresholds in the
range 38–40 EeV, with post-trial p-values of 8.3 × 10−4,
7.9 × 10−4, 4.2 × 10−4 and 3.2 × 10−5 for jetted AGNs
traced by their γ-ray emission, galaxies traced by their
near-infrared emission, all AGNs traced by their X-ray
emission and starburst galaxies traced by their radio
emission, respectively. As in Pierre Auger Collaboration
(2018b), we do not penalize for the test of the four cata-
logs, which all provide similar UHECR ﬂux patterns. As
a note, the infrared sample of galaxies contains a large
fraction (more than 75%) of each of the three other cat-
alogs and only jetted AGN and starburst catalogs can
be considered as strictly distinct galaxy samples.

As discussed in Sec. 4.1, all four sky models tested
here are based on improved versions of the catalogs used
in Pierre Auger Collaboration (2018b), although with a
mild impact on the signiﬁcance of the results and no
noticeable change in the best-ﬁt parameters. The max-
imum test statistic is obtained at the same point of the
parameter space using the catalogs of infrared galaxies,
starburst galaxies, and X-ray AGNs from Pierre Auger
Collaboration (2018b), with TS values of 16.0, 23.1 and
18.0, respectively, diﬀering by less than 2 units from the
results in Table 2. The most important change is ob-
served for the gamma-ray catalog of jetted AGNs: the
maximum TS (13.5) is obtained above ∼ 60 EeV with
the earlier catalog version based on the 2FHL catalog
(Eγ > 50 GeV), while it is obtained above ∼ 40 EeV
with the current version based on the 3FHL catalog
(Eγ > 10 GeV). The change can be understood from
the lower energy threshold of the 3FHL catalog, which
reduces the relative ﬂux of blazars beyond 100 Mpc
(Mkn 421, Mkn 501) with respect to the ﬂux of local
radio galaxies (Cen A, NGC 1275, M 87).

5. THE CENTAURUS REGION

A visual inspection of the sky models displayed in
Appendix C highlights the main similarity between the
four catalogs, namely a hotspot expected in the Auger
ﬁeld of view in the direction of the group of galaxies
composed of the radio galaxy Centaurus A, the Seyfert
galaxy NGC 4945 and the starburst galaxy M 83. These
three galaxies, at distances of about 4 Mpc, constitute

ence, we estimate that there is a total of ﬁve to six inde-
pendent energy bins, by identifying the successive refer-
ence energy thresholds above which the number of events
is less that half that above a previous reference energy.
Such a procedure suggests reference energy thresholds
at E (cid:38) 32, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 EeV, with boundaries dis-
tant by more than ∆ log10 E = 0.06, that corresponds
to the energy resolution of ±7% relevant in the range
covered here (Pierre Auger Collaboration 2020b). As
illustrated by the set of Figures above energy thresh-
olds ranging in 32–80 EeV (see online material attached
to Figure 4), the reconstructed parameters do not show
signiﬁcant variations with energy.

tracing accretion through X-ray emission and jet activ-
ity through γ-ray emission, does not suggest bright sec-
ondary hotspots in other sky regions at the highest en-
ergies (E (cid:38) 60 EeV), as the attenuation of the UHECR
ﬂux dramatically reduces the contribution from more
distant galaxies. On the other hand, both the infrared
model of stellar mass and the radio model of enhanced
starforming activity suggest hotspots in the directions
of other members of the Council of Giants: the star-
burst galaxies NGC 253 and M 82, which are the only
two starburst galaxies currently detected at TeV ener-

gies.7 While M 82 lies in the blind region of the Pierre
Auger Observatory, which can only be observed with
Telescope Array (Telescope Array Collaboration 2018),
the contribution from NGC 253 is responsible for the
larger departure from isotropy obtained with the star-
burst model with respect e.g. to the X-ray AGN model
(see Appendix C). The infrared model instead yields a
smaller test statistic than both the X-ray AGN and star-
burst models. Within the infrared model, the region of
the Virgo cluster (at d ∼ 20 Mpc) would be brighter
than the Centaurus region, which is in tension with the
UHECR observations. Following the same procedure as
in Pierre Auger Collaboration (2018b), we performed
a quantitative comparison between the four models to

against the others. The infrared, X-ray and γ-ray mod-
els ﬁt the data at E ≥ 38 − 40 EeV worse than the
starburst model with C.L. (cid:46) 3 σ. No ﬁrm evidence for a
catalog preference is identiﬁed.

The deviation from isotropy suggested with all four
galaxy catalogs is driven by a hotspot in the Centaurus
region. This region shows an enhanced ﬂux in all four
sky models, arising mainly from Centaurus A for the
two AGN models, NGC 4945 for the starburst model
and from both galaxies in the infrared model. The peak
direction of the UHECR hotspot, as identiﬁed through
the blind search described in Section 3.1, points 2.9◦
away from the main contributor to the starburst model,
NGC 4945, and 5.1◦ away from the main contributor to
the AGN models, Centaurus A.

Centaurus A, being the closest radio galaxy at 3.68 ±
0.05 Mpc, has been the target of searches for UHECR
excess by the Pierre Auger Collaboration for more than
a decade (Pierre Auger Collaboration 2007). We update
such searches by performing the same analysis described
in Section 3.3 using as target the position of Centau-
rus A, (α, δ) = (201.4◦, −43.0◦). The map of the local
p-values as a function of energy threshold and top-hat
search angle is shown in Figure 5. The most signiﬁcant
excess is found at Eth = 38 EeV in a circle of top-hat
radius Ψ = 27◦, where the number of observed events
is Nobs = 215 while Nexp = 152.0 events would be ex-
pected from isotropy. The minimum local p-value, which
is estimated as in Section 3 from the binomial probabil-
ity to observe Nobs or more events from an isotropic
distribution, is 2.1 × 10−7. After penalization for the
scan in energy and search angle, the post-trial p-value is
4.5 × 10−5, similar to that obtained with the likelihood-
ratio test for starburst galaxies against isotropy.

The best-ﬁt parameters of the search in the direction
of Centaurus A are unsurprisingly similar to those of the
blind search. The lower post-trial p-value with respect
to the blind search results from the direction being ﬁxed
a priori, as suggested by the early-day searches from
the Pierre Auger Collaboration (Pierre Auger Collabo-
ration 2007, 2010b). The top-hat angular scale inferred
from the blind search and from the search at the posi-
tion of Centaurus A, Ψ = 24 − 27◦, can be compared
to the Fisher search radius inferred from the catalog-
based searches through the relation Ψ = 1.59 × Θ.8 The
catalog-based searches yield Θ = 14◦ − 16◦ that corre-
sponds to Ψ = 22◦ − 25◦, i.e. a range of values that is
consistent with those inferred from the other searches.
Both the catalog-based searches and search in the
Centaurus region point to a most signiﬁcant signal at
an energy threshold close to 40 EeV. This energy range
encompasses the ﬂux suppression of the energy spectrum
above the toe, at E34 = 46 ± 3 ± 6 EeV (Pierre Auger
Collaboration 2020b). The evolution of the signal with
energy displayed in Figure 3 appears to be mainly driven
by the event distribution in the Centaurus region, as il-
lustrated in Figure 6. The pre-trial p-value in the Cen-
taurus region is obtained by proﬁling the local p-value
against the search radius and penalizing for this free pa-
rameter. The proﬁle as a function of energy threshold is
compared to the test statistic of the starburst catalog.
The latter is chosen as example, noting that the results
obtained with other catalogs show a similar dependence
on energy threshold (see Figure 3).

8 For a Fisher radius Θ (cid:28) 1 rad, this relation provides the top-
hat radius Ψ that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio, where the
noise is ∝
1 − cos Ψ and the signal is ∝ exp(k) − exp(k cos Ψ),
with the concentration parameter k = [2(1 − cos Θ)]−1.

parameters, is marked with a white cross.

Constraints from maximum shower-depths up to a few
tens of EeV and from the broad-band spectrum above
the ankle energy suggest that UHECRs are accelerated
in proportion to their charge, following so-called Pe-
ters’ cycles (Pierre Auger Collaboration 2017c, 2020d).
The cosmic-ray composition above the toe in the en-
ergy spectrum is then expected to be dominated by
UHECRs near a maximum magnetic rigidity, Rcut. Ac-
counting for both systematic uncertainties on the en-
ergy and maximum shower-depth scales, we inferred in
Pierre Auger Collaboration (2017c) a maximum rigidity
log10(Rcut/V) = 18.72+0.04
−0.03 with our reference model.
Adopting this value as the typical rigidity of UHECRs
above the toe, a lower bound on the charge of the bulk
of UHECRs above a given energy threshold can be es-
timated as Zmin = Eth/Rcut, as ﬁgured in the top axis
of Figure 6. The uncertainties on the points illustrate
those on the maximum rigidity in the reference scenario.
It should be noted that the composition at the highest
energies remains poorly constrained with Phase 1 data
and can only be conjectured from a model-dependent
approach at this stage.

At rigidities close to Rcut = 5EV, i.e. log10(Rcut/V) ≈
18.7, UHECR propagation in the magnetic ﬁeld of the
Milky Way enters into a semi-ballistic regime (Erdmann
et al. 2016). Excesses identiﬁed in the UHECR sky could
thus be used both to track back putative sources and
possibly to constrain the conﬁguration and strength of
the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld (see Boulanger et al. 2018,
and references therein). The angular scale inferred from
the catalog-based search, as well as that from the blind
search and search in the Centaurus region, are consis-
tent with the average angular dispersion expected in the

Figure 6. The test statistic and pre-trial p-value, after

points along the top axis ﬁgure the estimate of a lower bound
on the bulk charge of UHECRs above a given energy thresh-
old, under the assumption of an energy-to-charge ratio close
to the maximum rigidity inferred by jointly modeling the

Collaboration 2017c).

Milky Way of the Auger mix of nuclear species (Pierre
Auger Collaboration 2018b). Nonetheless, the lack of a
signiﬁcant preference for a speciﬁc class of galaxies and
the strength of the anisotropy signal, reaching at best
post-trial p-values of (3 − 5) × 10−5, still limit the identi-
ﬁcation of the host galaxies of UHECR accelerators and
UHECR constraints on the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld.

Although only pieces of evidence for anisotropy on
intermediate angular scale can be claimed with the
Phase 1 high-energy data set, the continued operation
of the array may enable the reach of the 5 σ discovery
threshold. The latter corresponds to a post-trial p-value
of 2.9 × 10−7 or 5.7 × 10−7 considering a search for both
excesses and deﬁcits (2-sided test) or just for excesses
(1-sided test). The growth of the signal in the Cen-
taurus region, quantiﬁed by the excess of events with

the test statistic of starburst model are displayed as a
function of accumulated exposure in Figure 7. These
analyses yield post-trial signiﬁcances of 3.9–4.2 σ for a
1- or 2-sided test applied to the Phase 1 high-energy data
set. Both the test statistic and the excess of events are
expected to grow linearly with exposure and the ﬂuctua-
tions observed around such a linear behavior are consis-
tent with those expected from simulations. The model-
independent search in the Centaurus region shows the
smallest ﬂuctuations and may be the most robust ap-
proach to forecasting the evolution of the signal. As-

posure of 165,000 ± 15,000 km2 yr sr (68% C.L.), which
would be within reach by the end of 2025 (± 2 calendar
years) adopting an approach similar to that developed
in the present study.

6. CONCLUSION

We have presented the measurement and analysis of
arrival directions of the highest-energy events detected
at the Pierre Auger Observatory during its ﬁrst phase of
operation. With a total of 2,635 UHECR events above
32 EeV and accumulated exposure of 122,000 km2 sr yr,
no indication for anisotropies on angular scales rang-
ing from one to thirty degrees emerges from auto-
correlation studies or from blind searches over the en-
tire sky. This lack of signiﬁcant deviation from isotropy
can be attributed a posteriori to the small amplitude
of the anisotropic signal evidenced here, to the vast-
ness of the parameter space that has been probed, in
addition to the limited number of events at the high-
est energies. More focused searches along the Galactic
center and Galactic plane do not reveal any excesses.
The ﬂux along these structures and the associated sta-
tistical uncertainty are ΦGC(≥ 40 EeV, Ψ = 25◦) =
(10.9±1.1)×10−3km−2yr−1sr−1 and ΦGP(≥40EeV, Ψ =
25◦) = (9.8 ± 0.7) × 10−3 km−2 yr−1 sr−1, respec-
tively.
These values can be compared to aver-
age ﬂux over the ﬁeld of view of the Observatory
ΦISO(≥ 40 EeV) = (11.3 ± 0.4) × 10−3 km−2 yr−1 sr−1. A
study along the supergalactic plane, not distinguishing
among the various galaxies forming this structure, sim-

ilarly yields ΦSGP(≥ 40 EeV, Ψ = 25◦) = (9.8 ± 0.6) ×
10−3 km−2 yr−1 sr−1.

Accounting for the attenuation of the UHECR mix
inferred from lower energy observations, the sky viewed
from the Pierre Auger Observatory is better modeled
with a ∼ 10% ﬂux excess in the directions of nearby
galaxies observed in the radio, near-infrared, X-ray and
gamma-ray bands. A 1-sided test for an excess disfavors
isotropy at the 3.3 − 4.2 σ level, depending on the cat-
alog. A model-independent analysis of the Centaurus
region, which contains the most prominent active and
star-forming galaxies expected to contribute at these en-
ergies, reveals an excess that is signiﬁcant at the 4.1 σ
C.L.

The average ﬂux above 40 EeV in a 25◦ top-hat
region centered on Centaurus A can be estimated
to ΦCen(≥ 40 EeV, Ψ = 25◦) = (15.9 ± 1.3) ×
10−3 km−2 yr−1 sr−1. In comparison, regions centered on
the Virgo cluster and on the starburst galaxy NGC 253
show ﬂuxes of ΦVirgo(≥ 40 EeV, Ψ = 25◦) = (12.2 ±
1.8) × 10−3 km−2 yr−1 sr−1 and ΦNGC 253(≥ 40 EeV, Ψ =
25◦) = (12.8 ± 1.2) × 10−3 km−2 yr−1 sr−1. As illustrated
by the model sky maps in Appendix C, the regions of
NGC 253 and of the Virgo cluster could be expected
to be as bright as and brighter than the Centaurus re-
gion if the UHECR emission rate was simply traced by
star-formation rate and stellar mass, respectively. At
the present stage, although the starburst catalog enables
the identiﬁcation of the most signiﬁcant deviation from
isotropy (4.2 σ) and the jetted AGN catalog the least
signiﬁcant deviation (3.3 σ), no ﬁrm preference for cor-
relation with a speciﬁc class of galaxies can be stated.
It should further be noted that such a preferred cor-
relation would not necessarily suggest causation in the

form of the identiﬁcation of the origin of UHECRs, as
regular and turbulent magnetic ﬁelds traversed by these
charged particles could alter the anisotropic pattern ob-
served on Earth (e.g. Kotera & Lemoine 2008; Erdmann
et al. 2016; Farrar & Sutherland 2019; Bell & Matthews
2022).

Though the most signiﬁcant deviation from isotropy
is found at energies around ∼ 40 EeV for almost all the
analyses, the excess is also hinted at for all catalogs and
the Centaurus region at energies around ∼ 60 EeV, as
shown in Figure 8 (see online material). Indeed, it was
in this higher energy range that the ﬁrst indication of
anisotropy was found in early Auger data (Pierre Auger
Collaboration 2007). An interpretation of the energy
evolution of the signal on intermediate angular scales
could be drawn in terms of maximum energy achieved
for higher-charge nuclei. In a Peters’ cycle scenario such
as discussed in Section 5, the evidence for anisotropy
above ∼ 40 EeV would be interpreted as stemming from
CNO nuclei, which would suggest Z ≈ 10 − 12 nuclei
to be responsible for the departure from isotropy above
∼ 60 EeV. The estimate of maximum rigidity used here
is based on the combined ﬁt of spectrum and depth of
shower maximum performed in Pierre Auger Collabora-
tion (2017c). The direct inclusion in such analyses of
arrival-direction information will enable us to test more
directly this scenario. If this scenario of local extragalac-
tic sources is extrapolated to lower energies, one could
expect a contribution from He nuclei (see e.g. Lemoine

& Waxman 2009) in the energy range where a signiﬁ-
cant dipole, but no signiﬁcant quadrupole has been re-
ported using data from the Observatory. The strength
of such an anisotropic contribution could nonetheless
be further diluted in the contribution from more dis-
tant sources. We foresee that an in-depth comparison
could be drawn studying the evolution of the large-scale
dipolar and quadrupolar components as a function of
energy.9 Alternatively, a more model-dependent but
also more-constrained approach could exploit full-sky
ﬂux-limited catalogs encompassing galaxies out to the
cosmic-ray horizon at the ankle energy.

At this stage, it is not possible to make claims on
which are the sources of the highest energy particles
known in the Universe. This is in part due to the de-
ﬂection they suﬀer in magnetic ﬁelds.
Identifying the
sources of UHECRs indeed runs parallel to deducing
properties of Galactic and extragalactic magnetic ﬁelds,
and constraints on one of these will enhance our un-
derstanding of the other. An important step will be
taken through the inclusion of composition-sensitive ob-
servables in arrival direction studies. This will be done

9 We checked that no signiﬁcant large-scale deviation from isotropy
can be inferred from arrival-direction data in the energy range
covered here, with constraints on the dipolar and quadrupolar
components not in tension with those expected from best-ﬁt
catalog-based models (as inferred e.g. for the 2MASS Redshift
Survey in di Matteo & Tinyakov 2018).

of such composition observables or by their use, event
by event, to select only candidate light nuclei. Future
studies using the Observatory oﬀer the promise to do so
by means of the AugerPrime upgrade, currently being
completed, which will enhance mass discrimination with
the 100% duty cycle of the surface detector.

APPENDIX

A. DATA

The data set used here consists of 2,635 events above 32 EeV collected at the Pierre Auger Observatory from
1 January 2004 to 31 December 2020. The data set is formatted as shown in Table 3, which lists the twenty highest
energy events. For each event, we report the year in which the event was detected, the Julian day of the year and
the time of detection in UTC seconds. The arrival directions are expressed in local coordinates, (θ, φ), the zenith and
azimuth angle (measured counterclockwise from the east), respectively, and in equatorial coordinates (J2000), (α, δ),
the right ascension (R.A.) and declination (Dec), respectively. Finally, the reconstructed energy, in EeV, and the
integrated exposure accumulated up to the time of detection are reported in the last two columns. The full list of
2,635 events, with the same information as in Table 3, is available at DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6504276 together with the
code, the structure of which is described in Appendix B.

The energies and arrival directions of the events may have changed with respect to those already released in previous
works, such as Pierre Auger Collaboration (2015a). These changes are due to the reﬁnements in the reconstruction
reported in Section 2 and to updates in the energy scale and calibration which were improved over the years. Similarly,
a subsample of the vertical events used here is included in the recent Data Release from the Collaboration (Pierre
Auger Collaboration 2021c). The latter were derived with the other reconstruction software used in the Collaboration,
which enables independent cross checks and shows good consistency with the reconstruction software used here (Pierre
Auger Collaboration 2020c).

As mentioned in Section 2, the ratio of the number of inclined and vertical events is energy dependent. Anisotropy
itself could impact the ratio of inclined and vertical events, as the two exposures diﬀer over the sky. This eﬀect is
however small: the excess reported in Section 5 would imply an expected ratio of Nincl/Nvert = 0.273 instead of 0.278
for an isotropic distribution. Above 32 EeV, a non-signiﬁcant excess of inclined events is observed with respect to
expectations from the exposure ratio and ﬁnite energy resolution (Nincl/Nvert = 0.292 ± 0.014). Above 80 EeV, there
are 10 events with θ ≥ 60◦ and 86 with θ < 60◦, which corresponds to a ratio of Nincl/Nvert = 0.116±0.039. The deﬁcit
of inclined events is most signiﬁcant above ∼ 90 EeV, which results in a post-trial signiﬁcance (under the assumption of
isotropy) at the level of ∼ 2.5 σ, when penalized for a search as a function of energy. Such a discrepancy or a stronger
one would have a 1.3% probability of being found as a statistical ﬂuctuation under the hypothesis that the energy
calibrations of both data streams are correct. For completeness, we also consider the hypothesis that the deﬁcit of
inclined events at the highest energies is at least partly due to a systematic underestimation of inclined energies (or
overestimation of vertical ones), as diﬀerent reconstruction techniques are used for the two sets. We tested for this
eﬀect empirically by selecting the events with zenith angles between 57◦ < θ < 63◦ that are reconstructed by both the
vertical and inclined reconstructions and for which six active stations surround the one closest to the core position.
There are 161 such events and a power-law relation of the form Evert = A · EB
incl was ﬁtted to extract the parameters
(A, B) that would convert the energies obtained from the inclined reconstruction to the energies obtained from the
vertical reconstruction. The results are such that Evert = 80 EeV would correspond to Eincl = 76.1 ± 1.6 EeV. We
applied the change to the energies of events in the inclined data set and performed, as a cross-check, the likelihood
analysis with the starburst catalog (as in Section 4.1) and the Centaurus-region analysis (as in Section 5). In both
cases, we found the same results presented with the standard data set. This cross-check demonstrates that the possible
systematic uncertainties induced by the diﬀerence in energy calibration of the vertical and inclined reconstructions do
not aﬀect the results presented in this paper.

fig2sgp.root, which contain the local p-value in bins of energy threshold and search radius for the Centaurus
region, Galactic center, Galactic plane and supergalactic plane analyses, respectively; the .root ﬁles in the
Autocorrelation and Targeted folders contain also copies of the support histograms used to calculate the local
p-value which are used by the penalization algorithm. The script 2 penalization.cc produces the post-trial
p-value in single-value text form, as well as the ﬁle fig6tmp.txt, which stores the pre-trial p-values as a function
of energy threshold penalized only for the scan in angle (see Figure 6).

• The Catalog Based folder contains the code for the likelihood-ratio analysis. The ﬁrst folder level comprises:

– dedicated utilities (utils.h and utils.cc);

– the folder Catalogs, which contains the raw catalogs of galaxies in the subfolder Multiwavelength, as
described in Appendix C. The raw catalog ﬁles are input, above a ﬁxed energy threshold, to the script
propagate.cc, in conjunction with the Auger composition model contained in the ﬁle AnaCRP3.root, to
produce the attenuated models used in the analysis. These attenuated models can be produced above all
energy thresholds by running the script propagate.py, with outputs stored in the subfolder ModelsUHECR.
The latter is organized as diﬀerent folders for each catalog;

– the analysis routines: 1 pre trial.cc, which produces the results stored in the ﬁles fig3.root, showing the
test statistic, signal fraction and search radius as a function of threshold energy, and fig4.root, showing
the test statistic as a function of the signal fraction and search radius with 68% C.L. contours for each
catalog; 2 penalization.cc produces the post-trial p-values.

• The Visuals folder contains scripts that produce the ﬁgures shown in the paper. The python script skymaps.py
produces the sky maps in Hammer-Aitoﬀ view: the Li-Ma signiﬁcance map, fig1.pdf, the ﬂux maps above
successive energy threshold stored in fig8.pdf and the model maps stored in fig10.pdf. The script
show figures.py produces fig2.pdf, fig3.pdf, fig4.pdf and fig5.pdf from their respective root ﬁles. The
script evolution.cc produces fig6.pdf, the plot of the pre-trial p-values from the Centaurus-region analysis and
likelihood-ratio analysis against starburst galaxies as a function of threshold energy; it also produces fig7.pdf,
the plot of the evolution of test statistic of the starburst analysis and of the excess in the Centaurus region as a
function of the exposure accumulated at the Observatory.

The best-ﬁt sky models above 40 EeV obtained with the four catalogs described in Section 4.1 are shown in Figure 10.
These sky maps do not include any isotropic component and display only the ﬂux expected from galaxies included in
the catalogs, which is smeared on the best-ﬁt Fisher angular scale above 40 EeV obtained with each catalog. A further
top-hat smoothing on an angular scale Ψ = 25◦ is performed for the sake of comparison with Figure 8.

C. CATALOGS

Figure 10. Best-ﬁt UHECR source models above 40 EeV with a top-hat smoothing radius Ψ = 25◦ in Galactic coordinates.
The supergalactic plane is shown as a gray line. Prominent sources in each of the catalogs are marked with gray circles.

The models shown in Figure 10 are based on the UHECR ﬂux expected from each galaxy in proportion to its
electromagnetic ﬂux. The multiwavelength information on the galaxies is made available in the Multiwavelength sub-
folder of the catalog-based study, as described in Appendix B, and is available online at DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6504276.
The Multiwavelength folder contains one ﬁle per catalog, with tabulated values detailed in Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7.
The ﬁrst column of each of these tables provides the name of the source as referenced by the authors of the source
catalog. The second column provides a counterpart name that is consistent across all four catalogs. The third column
provides the type of galaxy, extracted either from the source catalog or from the HyperLEDA database. The fourth
and ﬁfth columns provide the equatorial coordinates of the galaxy. The sixth and seventh columns display the distance
modulus and associated uncertainty extracted from the modbest entry of the HyperLEDA database. The eighth and
ninth columns display the corresponding luminosity distance in Mpc as well as the relative uncertainty on this quantity.
The electromagnetic ﬂux of each galaxy is provided in column 10, except in Table 4 where the K-band magnitude is
provided. Whenever available, the uncertainty on the quantity provided in column 10 is shown in column 11. Finally,
a ﬂag is provided in the last columns of Tables 5, 6 and 7. This ﬂag indicates whether the galaxy was also included
in the main samples studied in Pierre Auger Collaboration (2018b) (Y), in one of the cross-check samples (X), or
not included in earlier versions of these catalogs (N). The ﬂag column of Table 6 indicates the origin of the redshift
estimate, either from HyperLEDA or from NED for the 23 X-ray AGNs that are not listed in HyperLEDA.
