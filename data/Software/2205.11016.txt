Abstract

Molecular structures are always depicted as 2D printed form in scientiﬁc docu-

ments like journal papers and patents. However, these 2D depictions are not machine-

readable. Due to a backlog of decades and an increasing amount of these printed

literature, there is a high demand for the translation of printed depictions into machine-

readable formats, which is known as Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR).

Most OCSR systems developed over the last three decades follow a rule-based approach

where the key step of vectorization of the depiction is based on the interpretation of vec-

tors and nodes as bonds and atoms. Here, we present a practical software MolMiner,

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
which is primarily built up using deep neural networks originally developed for se-

mantic segmentation and object detection to recognize atom and bond elements from

documents. These recognized elements can be easily connected as a molecular graph

with distance-based construction algorithm. We carefully evaluate our software on

four benchmark datasets with the state-of-the-art performance. Various real applica-

tion scenarios are also tested, yielding satisfactory outcomes. The free download links

of Mac and Windows versions are available: Mac link and Windows link.

Introduction

Chemical products are a vast amount of priceless wealth, and are making our life and health

better. Much eﬀorts on chemical research and development have been made and published

as primary scientiﬁc literature. During the last decade, researchers have developed various

machine learning and deep learning models to solve a series of predictive and generative tasks

in the ﬁelds of chemistry and biology. 1–3 It is obvious that well-performed computational

models cannot be separated from data accumulation, especially for experimental data, e.g.

chemical reaction data and biological active data.

Some well-known databases have play a vital role on scientiﬁc studies. For example, the

Protein Data Bank database is an important undertaking to make protein crystal struc-

tural data to be public, which has greatly facilitated research eﬀorts and knowledge de-

velopments. 4 Several large comprehensive biomedical databases like ChEMBL have been

constructed and updated. These datasets oﬀer a necessary basis and chance to develop var-

ious practical advanced technologies. 5 Recently, there is a renewed interest to structurally

collate experimental data sets and build their inter- and intra- relationships to enhance var-

ious downstream predictions and recommendations. The Open Reaction Database aims to

collect and share chemical reaction data from journal articles, patents, and even electronic

laboratory notebooks. 6 Due to the rapidly increasing amount of literature resources, we ﬁnd

it both laborious and time-consuming to integrate diverse kinds of experimental data into a

comprehensive and professional knowledge database.

Automatic computational methods provide a potential option to handle with various

forms of valuable chemical and biological information. Named Entity Recognition tools have

been applied to extract chemical textual information from the literature to create structured

data. 7 Besides text-like objects, researchers also have developed Optical Chemical Structure

Recognition (OCSR) tools with the intention of decoding a graphical chemical depiction into

a machine-readable molecular format. However, there is still a non-trivial problem of how

to accurately recognize the molecular structures from electronic materials.

3

Since 1990, several closed- and open-source OCSR systems have been established based

on similar rule-based implementations involving image vectorization, image thinning, line

enhancement, text-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and graph reconstruction.

A representative system, named Chemical Literature Data Extraction (CLiDE), is a com-

mercial OCSR toolkit developed by Keymodule. 8 And it has been integrated into ChemAxon

software. 9 Generally, most of the commercial OCSR systems were unavailable to academic

researchers. In 2009, Filippov and Nicklaus published the ﬁrst open-source system called

Optical Structure Recognition Application (OSRA). 10 And this tool is kept active and up-

graded for improved recognition. Imago and MolVec also have been developed as open-source

systems to oﬀer researchers optional tools of molecular structure recognition. 11,12 More detail

OCSR systems can refer to this review. 13

Dramatic developments on deep learning (DL) frameworks and hardware have achieved

in image recognition technologies. Recently, a biopharmaceutical company, Bristol-Myers

Squibb, held a competition of molecular translation in Kaggle. 14 The architecture of CNN-

Transformer plays an essential role in translating chemical images to InChI strings. 15 Based

on this, DECIMER has been reported for translating various chemical images to SELFIES

strings with an acceptable precision. 16 Similarly, Bayer researchers have developed another

translation method called Img2Mol, exhibiting a potential ability of recognizing hand-drawn

molecules. 17 Inspired by image segmentation technologies, ChemGrapher used atom-based,

bond-based and charge-based segmentation neural networks to predict the probabilities of

each pixel for a chemical image, and then construct a chemical graph. 18 Following this

work, ABC-Net applied a divide-and-conquer segmentation strategy to signiﬁcantly improve

recognition performance. 19 Although these DL-based works deliver a promising and potential

application value, these results actually are short of rigorous evaluations on benchmark

datasets and real-world data sets.

Taking substantial strengths of DL into consideration, 20 we developed a practical DL-

based system called MolMiner to improve OCSR tasks.

It can rapidly and accurately

4

extract chemical images and then recognize chemical structures from PDF-format docu-

ments. MolMiner was also fairly tested using the benchmark data sets 13 and some real-world

datasets. The test performance shows that MolMiner can outperform three existing open-

source systems. We also integrated some basic functions like real-time correction function

and screenshot function into MolMiner to provide a user-friendly interface. The Win/Mac

free download links are Windows link and Mac link, respectively. MolMiner would be freely

available with daily permission to all registered users.

MolMiner Recognition System

Implementation

MolMiner is a rule-free learning system.

It aims to transform the vectorization problem

into object detection tasks. That means it can extract chemical elements in a object de-

tection manner by training well-labelled datasets with atom and bond annotations. It was

implemented by ﬁve main modules as follows.

• Data generation and annotation module aims to automatically generate various styles

of well-annotated chemical images based on the modiﬁed RDKit toolkit. 21 It can sup-

port several augmentation operations, such as rotation, thinning, thickness, noise and

super group. More augmentation operations (e.g. hand-drawn lines) will be added into

this module in the future, which is well-suited for various real application scenarios.

• Chemical image extraction module is a fully DL-driven image segmentation module,

and is implemented by a light-weight model MobileNetV2. 22 It is used to extract

printed chemical depiction from PDF-format documents. Labelled data is generated by

the ﬁrst module with several predeﬁned templates such as journal style and patent style.

The two categorical annotations are adopted to train this model with the weighted

cross entropy loss of a ratio 1:2 of background-class and compound-class. The key

performace of recall is 95.5%.

• Chemical image recognition module is the paramount key module for rapid and accu-

rate chemical structure recognition. It is implemented based on a popular one-stage

YOLOv5 architecture. 23 After a series of evaluations on MaskRCNN, 24 FastRCNN, 25

EﬃcientDet, 26 we empirically found the YOLOv5 model could signiﬁcantly outperform

other object detection architectures just for this recognition task. The atom labels in-

clude “Si”, “N”, “Br”, “S”, “I”, “Cl”, “H”, “P”, “O”, “C”, “B”, “F”, “Text”. And

the bond labels include “Single”, “Double”, “Triple”, “Wedge”, “Dash”, “Wavy”. The

6

whole predicted mAP@.5 is 97.5%. Labelled data is automatically generated by the

ﬁrst module with several image-level augmentation operations.

• Text-based optical character recognition (OCR) module is used to recognize chemistry-

text images with atom characters and super groups. This OCR model is implemented

by ﬁnetuning a pretrained EasyOCR model 27 with speciﬁcally cropped chemical texts

from the ﬁrst module. The accuracy performance is about 96.4%.

• Chemical element construction and evaluation module contains a distance-based graph

construction algorithm accompanied by super group parser, and an automatic evalu-

ation module for performing fair MCS-based and InChI-based comparisons on bench-

mark datasets. The super groups are collected from RDKit code, ChemAxon, OSRA

and some JMC journals. The evaluation results are discussed in the Section of Bench-

mark Evaluation.

In comparison to rule-based systems, MolMiner has several advantages: i) Batch GPU-

based inference can make the speed of element recognition faster than vectorization algo-

rithms; ii) It can implicitly learn rules from a large amount of automatic generated datasets

or other manual annotated datasets, without designing explicit rules. This feature can be

simply extended to new scenes; iii) It can support rapid synchronous recognition of multiple

large-size images; iv) It provides additional user-friendly interfaces for easy-to-use.

User Interface

User interface of MolMIner integrate several frequently-used functions including screenshot

recognition, batch PDF recognition, real-time molecular edit, collection, and SDF/XLSX-

format download.

Figure 1 presents the overview of real-time molecular edit interface. In this interface,

user can check and correct recognized molecules one-by-one to achieve the perfect accuracy

of 100%. After a simple testing on 1000 images of non-markush organic medicinal molecules,

7

it took about 5-10s for one simply-trained person to process one molecule with check, correct

and save operations. Other functional modules can be easily found in the MolMiner software.

Details can refer to the MolMiner User Manuals.

interest. The “Adjust Cropping” is to adjust the boundaries of the cropped images. The
“Delete” is to remove the selected cropped image; E) Real-time molecular edit (supported
by Ketcher v2.4 29). E1 contains the four basic functions of Copy, Save, Favorites and Next.

MolMiner Evaluation

Benchmark Evaluation

We tested four benchmark data sets (USPTO, UOB, JPO, CLEF2012) referred to Rajan

et al. 13, shown in Table 1. We compared MolMiner’s runtime and accuracy performance

with other existing open-source OCSR tools such as MolVec, 12 OSRA 10 and Imago 11 on

these four datasets. We reviewed the consistency of InChI strings that is mentioned in

Rajan et al. 13. Considering the atom-level evaluation method from Imago, 30 we found that

the atom-level and bond-level consistency index of maximum common structures (MCS)

should be an appropriate metric for evaluating this task. It can comprehensively measure

the accuracy of atom-level and bond-level. In Table 2, we compared InChI-based accuracy

and MCS-based accuracy, and found some signiﬁcant diﬀerences due to the count of None

value, bond misplacement in aromatic rings, and RDKit-based InChI export. Here, MCS-

based accuracy is deemed as a more rigorous indicator to monitor the ﬁne-grained accuracy

of atoms and bonds. Successively, we analyzed the runtime and MCS-based (both atom-level

and bond-level) accuracy between our recognized molecules and ground truth molecules. The

results are summarized in Table 2, showing that MolMiner can outperform the open-source

tools both in runtimes and MCS accuracies on USPTO, UOB, JPO and CLEF2012.

Based on rule-based strategies, CLiDE Pro is a popular and professional commercial

software. Unfortunately, we currently cannot perform a fair comparison on this software.

According to reported USPTO results from ChemAxon, 31 the reported accuracy (93.8%) is

slightly better than our MCS-based accuracy (93.3%). One of possible reasons is the issue

of crossing bonds. As previously mentioned, since MolMiner is based on DL-based object

detection models, it is diﬃcult for crossing bonds to be well recognized just by these simple

atom and bond annotations. Manual correction is recommended in the interactive plugin of

Ketcher. We are planning to solve this issue with several unavoidable rules or coarse-grained

annotations.

Application Case Evaluation

Currently, MolMiner focuses on processing organic medicinal molecules (Non-Markush struc-

tures) from scientiﬁc documents. Molecular images with some errors (including crossing

bonds, noise and super group parser) are still needed some manual corrections in the inter-

active plugin of Ketcher. Here, we proposed and tested three application cases to validate

the ability of MolMiner.

• We took screenshot of a large-size image (3000 × 2068, 300 dpi) of palytoxin to make an

test. It took approximately 3 seconds to return one well-recognized molecular structure

without any manual corrections in the Ketcher plugin (shown in Figure 2).

Figure 2: A large-size (3000 × 2068) case of palytoxin

• A scanned PDF page from a scientiﬁc journal 32 (machine: HP M1210 MFP, dpi:

300, brightness: 128, contrast: 124) was tested by MolMiner, shown in Figure 3. The

11

recognized results are satisfactory and achieve 100% accuracy under a set of appropriate

scanning parameters. We also tried some sets of scanning parameters, which more or

less could inﬂuence the recognized results.

• We tested a challenging case of hand-drawn images from Clevert et al. 17. For Figure

4, although there are still some errors including “N”, “Cl”, wedge bonds and aromatic

rings, MolMiner (without training any similar data) could aﬀord to recognize some

simple hand-drawn images (Figure 4(right)), and main skeletons and their positions of

some complex images (Figure 4(left)). As a matter of fact, the retained position layout

is beneﬁcial for users to check and correct their structures.

Limitations

Current version of MolMiner is weak at dealing with the problems including crossing bonds,

colorful backgrounds, crowded layout segmentation and Markush structures. These problems

still need more or less manual corrections in the Ketcher plugin.

Conclusion

We have developed a practical OCSR software called MolMiner based on advanced deep

learning technologies (such as MobileNetv2, YOLOv5, EasyOCR). We also developed an

automatic data generation module to satisfy the data volume requirements of DL models.

The benckmark evaluation suggested current MolMiner could outperform the open-source

OCSR tools (e.g. MolVec, OSRA, Imago) on the performance of both accuracy and runtime.

MolMiner supports several frequently-used functions of batch PDF recognition, screenshot

recognition and real-time molecular edit. More other functions will be gradually integrated

into MolMiner. MolMiner is freely available here 33 with Mac and Windows versions. We

open daily access without cost for all registered users to ensure daily usage amount. We also

provide extra channels of enterprises for unlimited access.
