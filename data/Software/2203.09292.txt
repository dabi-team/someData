Introduction 

This technical report is a companion of the paper: 

España, S., Ramautar, V., Overbeek, S., Derikx, T.:Model-driven production of data-centric infographics: 
an application to the impact measurement domain. RCIS 2022 (under review). Springer (2019) 

That paper investigates the problems related to the conventional process to produce data-centric infographics, 
and  redesigns  this  process  following  the  model-driven  paradigm.  We  have  designed  a  domain-specific 
language to model infographics, and implemented an interpreter that generates the infographics automatically. 
To inform the engineering of the DSL and interpreter, we have analysed 58 infographics reporting on ethical, 
social and environmental (ESEA), and 10 infpgraphic design tools. We then have tested our proposal by means 
of modelling a sample of 10 infographics and generating them. We have also conducted a controlled experiment 
to assess the extent to which the generated infograhics are as visually attractive as the original ones and whether 
the participants can identify whether the infographic they see is original or generated. 

This report complements the above-mentioned paper in the following ways: 

•  Section 2 presents the conceptual model that resulted from investigating the role of infographics within the 

impact measuremet domain. 

•  Section 3 provides details on the infographic analysis. In particular, it includes a list of the 58 infographics, 
their sources, the infographic component types that we have found in them, along with the definitions of the 
infographic component types. 

•  Section 4 provides details on the infographic design tool analysis. In particular, it provides a list of the 10 
tools, the feature model that we have created for each of the tools, a table describing each of the generic 
features that we have identified across tools. 

•  Section 5 describes the sample of 10 infographics that we have used to test the DSL and the interpreter, and 
we have also used in a comparative experiment. In particular, it presents each pair of infographics in the 
sample  (i.e.  the  original  and  the  generated  infographic),  and  the  model  that  specifies  the  generated 
infographic using the DSL.  

•  Section 6 presents the user stories that specify the requirements for the DSL and the interpreter, tracing them 

to their sources and providing additional details. 

•  Section 7 presents instruments and data from controlled experiment in which we have compared original 
infographics and the corresponding ones that we have modelled and generated. In particular, we show an 
example of the survey used in the experiment, and the tables containing the raw data of the experiment 
results.

Conceptual model of infographics within the impact measurement domain 

To better understand the role of data-centric infographics in the domain of impact measurement and how they 
are related to other relevant concepts, we have conducted a multivocal literature review [1]. We decided to 
include grey literature because we are not only interested in peer-reviewed scientific results, but also in how 
ESEA practitioners are using infographics. 

The selected studies have been coded with Nvivo. Before strting the analysis, we already had some insights 
on  what  concepts  are  relevant  withing  the  ESEA  domain;  in  particular,  we  had  earlier  produced  an  initial 
version of the openESEA metamodel [2]). We used those concepts to inform our analysis and as a glossary 
when the terminology varies across papers. Still, we have opted for starting with an empty coding scheme and 
let it arise incrementally as we read and coded the studies. When a concept that seemed relevant to our purpose 
appeared in the text of the selected studies, we included a new node in the coding scheme. Then we checked 
whether such concept was present in the above-mentioned metamodel. If so, the definition and position within 
the metamodel (its relationships to other concepts) were taken into account. Table 1 presents and overview of 
results: 

•  Concept. The name of the concept. 
•  Working definition. A definition of the concept in the context of this research. 
•  Occurrences. Number of occurrences across the literature or, in other terms, the number of fragments in 

the selected studies that discuss this concept

Working definition 
The collection of data resulting  performing an ethical, social and environmental 
accounting (ESEA), which is the process of assessing and reporting on the social 
and environmental effects caused by an organisation’s economic actions to partic-
ular interest groups within society and to society itself [3]. The account can be con-
sidered as measurements of the performance of an organisation on ethical, social 
and environmental  (ESE) topics. It can be referred also as sustainability report, 
non-financial report, or social balance. It always covers a given time period (often 
one fiscal or natural year).  
A social entity that is goal-directed, that is designed as a deliberately structured and 
coordinated activity system, and that is linked to the external environment [4]. In 
our context, it is the organisation to which the account data refers to. 
A person with an interest or concern in something, especially an organisation [5]. 
Examples of stakeholders are the CEO of a company, a given client, a neighbour 
living next to a manufacturing premise. 
A  category  of  stakeholders;  organisations  typically  categorise  them  into  groups, 
based  on  their  conflicting  needs.  A  stakeholder  may  be  part  of  one  or  more 
stakeholder groups. Examples are consumers, clients, suppliers, shareholders, and 
watchdog organisations such as NGOs. 
The  group  of  people  performing  the  ESEA.  It  can  be  an  internal  team  (i.e. 
composed of members of the organisation, an external team (members from outside 
the organisation, or a mixed team (members from both groups).

Working definition 
Ethical,  social  and  environmental  (ESE)  topics  represent  phenomena  that 
organisations  or  individuals  are  (or  should  be)  concerned  about,  related  to 
organisational  ethics  (a.k.a.  governance  topics),  societal  issues  or  environmental 
concerns 
A  prescription  of  how  an  ethical,  social  and  environmental  account  should  be 
produced; among other issues, it can provide guidance on what topics should be 
assessed (or how to select those topics), what stakeholder groups to engage, what 
questions to include in the surveys to collect data for direct indicators, or how to 
report on the results. 
An indicator is a measure [6, 7] (also known as measurable element [8], or metric 
[9])  -i.e.  a  defined  measurement  approach  and  its  measurement  scale-  that  is 
proposed by an ESEA method as a way to assess organisational performance on 
ESE topics. 
An indicator that can be directly measured; for instance, by collecting its value from 
an enterprise information system or by asking it to a stakeholder via a survey. 
An indicator whose value needs to be calculated from other indicators; for instance, 
by means of a formula that operates on other direct or indirect indicators.   
The actual value of an indicator (also known as measurement result), for a given 
ESEA of a given company at a given point in time. 
An  organisation  that  develops  initiatives,  principles  or  standards  related  to 
corporate social and environmental performance [10]. Organisations willing to join 
a  network  may  need  to  meet  certain  performance,  legal,  transparency  or  other 
requirements.  Examples  are  the  B  Corporations,  the  Economy  for  the  Common 
Good,  and  the  Spanish  Network  of  Networks  of  Alternative  and  Solidarity 
Economy (REAS). 
Communication authored to report on an ESE account; that is, on the values of the 
indicators that report on the performance of the organisation.  
A document whereby an organisation communicate the results of an account to one 
specific  stakeholder  group  of  to  the  general  public.  Depending  on  who  the 
accounting team is and who is the intended audience of the report, different types 
of reports can be created [3]. 
An  infographic  (portmanteau  for  information  graphic)  blends  data  with  graphic 
design,  helping  individuals  and  organisations  concisely  communicate  complex 
information to an audience, in a manner that can be quickly consumed and easily 
understood [11]. 
The (software) technology that suports the application of the ESEA method, or the 
creation  of  the  reporting  documents.  Examples  of  tools  are  a  spreasheet,  a  full-
fledged ESEA web application, a text processor, and a graphics design application.

a. Document is a generalisation that facilitates us the creation of the conceptual model. 
b. Infographics are rarely mentioned in ESEA research. We did find them covered by many other papers in a separate 

literature review on infographics.

Analysis of infographics 

We include a list of the 58 infographics and their sources (Section 3.1), we present a copy of each infographic 
(Section 3.2), and we report on the result of the infographic analysis and what components we found in each 
(Section 3.3). 

3.1 

Sources of the infographics 

Table  2  enumerates  the  infographics  that  we  have  analysed  to  identify  infographic  component  types.  The 
columns are: 

•  #. A number identifying the infographic 
•  Org.  The  organisation  that  publishes  the  infographic.  Therefore,  the  infographic  presents  results  of  the 

ESEA of that organisation, assessing their performance on a series of topics. 

•  Year. The year to which the data presented in the infographic refers to. This is thus the year of the ESEA. 
•  URL of infographic. The cell contains a link to the infographic, as published by the organisation. To prevent 
that the infographics are lost when the organisations update their websites, we also present them in section  
•  URL of report. Some infographics are part of the sustainability reports of the organisations. When that is 

the case, then the cell contains a link to the report. 

•  S. Whether the infographic has is part of the sample we have used to test our proposal. If the infographic is 
", 
part of the sample, then the cell contains the identifier of the infographic in the sample, in the form of 𝐼!

 
 
where 𝐼 stands for infographic, O stands for original, and i is a sequential number. If the infographic is not 
part of the sample, then the cell is empty.

3.3  Analysis of infographic component types 

We  have  analysed  each  of  the  infographics  in  Table  2,  to  identify  component  types.  Fig.  60  shows  an 
example of how we have analysed the component architecture of a given infographic. Then Table 3 to Table 5 
show the result of our analysis of the infographics, by indicating how many components of each type are present 
in each infographic. The definitions of infographic component types are presented in Table 6.

Sample of 10 infographics 

We have sampled 10 of the infographics analysed in Section 3. For each, we have created a model and generated 
the infographic automatically using the openESEA tool. This has allowed us to test the DSL and the interpreter. 
This section presents each pair of infographics in the sample; that is the original (at the left in Fig. 71 to Fig. 
80) and the generated infographic (at the right of those figures). We also present the models that specify the 
generated infographics using the DSL, in Table 9 to Table 18. To facilitate the independent testing of our tool 
by third parties, we have encoded the data with its real values, instead of referencing indicators from an ESEA 
method.

User stories for the DSL and the interpreter 

In this section we present the list of requirements, expressed as user stories [12]. In Table 19, the columns 
contain the following information: 

•  ID. An identifier for the user story under with the format USi, where i is just an incremental number. 
•  Statement. The actual user story, expressed according to the Connextra template, which is widely adopted 

in industry [13]. 

•  Pri. The priority we assigned to this user story, using the MoSCoW method [14]. The cells contain one of 

these values: 
─  M. It means that the requirement must be implemented for the proof of concept. 
─  S. It means that the requirement should be implemented for the proof of concept.  
─  C. It means that the requirement could be implemented for the proof of concept. 
─  W. It means that the requirement won’t be implemented for the proof of concept. 

•  Imp. Whether the requirement has been implemented in the first proof of concept (1), or not (0).

In the following, we present the pre-requirements specification traceability. Table 20 and Table 21 trace the 

user stories to the following sources: 

 
•  O.  The  project  manager  and  product  owner  of  the  openESEA  tool.  User  stories  having  a  1  in  this  cell 
correspond to needs expressed by these stakeholders. Since these are the authors Sergio España and Vijanti 
Ramautar, respectively, these requirements can be considered as having been formulated by the research 
team. 

•  CM refers to the conceptual model presented in Fig. 1. 
•  Ci (that is, columns C1 to C22) refer to the infographic component types presented in Table 6. 
•  Fi (that is, F1 to F28) refer to the generic features of infographic design tools, presented in Table 8.
