Software-deﬁned radio dongles are small and inexpensive receivers well known to amateur radio
enthusiasts. When connected to an antenna, they enable monitoring of a wide range of the radio
spectrum by conditioning the input signal and transferring a downconverted version of it to a
personal computer for software processing. Here, we employ a composite of two such dongles,
interfaced with codes written in MATLAB and GNU Radio, as a measuring instrument to study
the ﬂexural vibrations of a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator. Instead of an antenna, we
connect the dongles to the split output of a photodetector used to detect vibrations optically. We
ﬁrst perform a quantitative analysis of the dynamics of the ﬁrst vibrational mode. We then measure
the response of the ﬁrst two vibrational modes in parallel. To illustrate our technique, we detect
changes in the vibrational amplitude of both modes induced by periodic strain modulation with
a delay of ≈ 1 ms between measurements. Last, we show that our software-based instrument can
be employed to demodulate human voice encoded in the vibrations of our resonator. For parallel
measurements of several frequency channels, and provided that the input signal is not too weak,
our composite system may oﬀer an alternative to the use of multiple lock-in ampliﬁers or multiple
spectrum analyzers, with the distinct advantage of being cost-eﬀective per frequency channel.

INTRODUCTION

Software-deﬁned radio (SDR) has made the radio fre-
quency spectrum accessible to everyone [1]. Amateur ra-
dio enthusiasts employ SDRs as inexpensive receivers to
demodulate signals they pick up from the air [2]. Ra-
dio astronomers have developed large arrays of antennas
where each antenna is connected to an SDR that dynam-
ically ampliﬁes and delays the received signal, making it
possible to combine all signals in phase [3–7]. Electrical
engineers and computer scientists have devised cognitive
radio systems inspired by SDRs, where empty portions
of the spectrum can be detected and dynamically allo-
cated to communicate more eﬃciently [8, 9]. The work-
ing principle of SDR is to perform as much processing
of the radio signal as possible in software, leaving signal
ampliﬁcation and ﬁltering to the analog front-end of the
receiver. This technology was born of the wish for a sin-
gle radio system that is agile, allowing the user to switch
dynamically between demodulation modes [10, 11]. Some
of the purest implementations of SDR, where the tasks
of the analog front-end are minimal, are advanced sys-
tems developed by radio astronomers [12]. Simpler and
less expensive SDR devices, albeit with more limited per-
formance, have become readily available in recent years.
The latter, called SDR dongles, are the ones we use in
this study.

SDR dongles evolved from tiny devices used to watch
television on a computer [2]. Those devices were based on

an analog radio frequency (RF) tuner chip on the antenna
side and a digital television demodulation chip on the
computer side. Bypassing the demodulation step made
it possible to pass frequency downconverted in-phase (I)
and quadrature (Q) components of the received RF signal
on to the computer, eﬀectively turning the devices into
inexpensive SDRs. Modern versions of such simple SDRs
are the size of a USB ﬂash drive [13]. They are valued by
radio amateurs and scientists alike because of their wide
frequency range, which extends from a few kilohertz to
several gigahertz. They enable a variety of digital sig-
nal processing tasks that are challenging to perform with
analog devices. These include processing signals with
user-deﬁned ﬁlters and dynamically changing demodula-
tion modes, all of which are performed by the computer.
Importantly, they come with open source software and
drivers, enabling applications that are limited only by
the imagination of the user. In a scientiﬁc context, SDR
dongles have been used recently for oscillator metrol-
ogy [14], frequency modulation spectroscopy [15], opti-
cal interferometry [16], magnetic resonance spectroscopy
[17], and dual-comb spectroscopy [18]. SDR dongles are
also used as receivers in Radio Jove 2.0, a citizen science
project supported by NASA whose participants measure
RF noise originating from Jupiter and from the Sun [19].

Here, we demonstrate that SDR dongles provide an
opportunity to facilitate the detection of nanomechani-
cal vibrations. To the best of our knowledge, SDRs have
not been employed to study nanomechanics thus far. De-
tecting the vibrations of nanomechanical resonators in-
volves transducing their displacement amplitude into an
electrical signal. Traditionally, this signal is further con-

ditioned and processed with a lock-in ampliﬁer or a spec-
trum analyzer. In our experimental setup, by contrast,
signal conditioning and processing are performed with a
composite of two SDR dongles running in parallel. The
combination of (i) parallel SDRs and (ii) our data acqui-
sition codes written in MATLAB and GNU Radio con-
stitutes our measuring instrument. It allows us to easily
measure two vibrational modes in parallel and to demod-
ulate frequency-modulated vibrations.

The nanomechanical resonator we study is based on a
suspended membrane of few-layer graphene (FLG) [20–
31]. FLG resonators have garnered much attention from
scientists on account of their large in-plane stiﬀness [32–
34] and their small mass. Large in-plane stiﬀness causes
resonant frequencies of ﬂexural vibrations to range from
a few megahertz to hundreds of megahertz, thereby span-
ning the high frequency and the very high frequency
range of the radio spectrum. The small mass makes the
resonators amenable to ultrasensitive detection schemes
including the detection of pressure changes [36–
[35],
38], ultrasound [39, 40], and light [41]. These detection
schemes are based on measuring amplitude changes and
resonant frequency shifts of a single vibrational mode. In
turn, measuring the response of several modes in parallel
is advantageous, as it results in improved sensing accu-
racies. Such parallel measurements are the core princi-
ple of ultrasensitive mass sensing experiments based on
resonators fabricated from bulk materials [42–44]. They
require one rather advanced measuring instrument, such
as a lock-in ampliﬁer or a spectrum analyzer, per vibra-
tional mode. Our work explores an alternate approach
based on a composite of two SDR dongles. We measure
the frequency response of the ﬁrst two vibrational modes
of our FLG resonator in parallel with a delay of
1 ms
between the two measurements. This is useful to verify
whether any anomalous feature in the lineshape of one
mode at a given time is also observed in the lineshape
of the other mode almost at the same time, indicating,
e.g., changes in mass or strain. To substantiate this idea,
we modulate strain within the resonator with steps of dc
voltage applied between the membrane and an underlying
gate electrode, and simultaneously record changes in the
amplitude of the modes at two oﬀ-resonance frequencies.
Finally, to complement our software-based measurement
approach, we demonstrate demodulation of frequency-
modulated driven vibrations in software, using human
voice and musical waveforms to modulate the driving
force.

≈

We believe that the advantages of our approach are
twofold. First, our technique allows us to monitor two
channels far apart in frequency with only a short time
delay. As mentioned above, the same may alternatively
be achieved with two lock-in ampliﬁers or two spectrum
analyzers. However, given that the input signal gets di-
vided among SDRs, using multiple SDRs suddenly makes
our system quite inexpensive per channel. Second, the
fact that SDR outputs I and Q components of the in-
put signal means that any type of demodulation can be

2

performed dynamically in software. This is beneﬁcial for
decoding any type of information imprinted in vibrations
[45]. Overall, we show that employing SDR dongles in
a vibration detection setup is a simple yet useful and
versatile method to acquire and process nanomechanical
signals.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Below, we brieﬂy describe the structure of our res-
onator and present our vibration detection setup. We
summarize the process by which SDRs receive and con-
dition the nanomechanical signal. Then, we characterize
the intrinsic frequency stability of the signal at the out-
put of one of our SDRs using a low phase noise input
signal.

Our resonator is shown in Fig. 1a. It is fabricated by
transferring a membrane of FLG onto a substrate that
we previously patterned using electron beam lithography
[46]. The substrate is made of highly resistive silicon
overgrown with thermal silicon oxide. A cylindrical cav-
ity, 250 nm deep and 3.1 µm in diameter, is etched in
the oxide layer. Metal electrodes are fabricated both on
the top surface of the substrate and at the bottom of
the cavity (Figs. 1a, b). The electrode on the top sur-
face is used to electrically contact the membrane, and
the electrode at the bottom of the cavity serves as a gate
electrode. Together, the membrane and the gate elec-
trode form a capacitor whose capacitance C, according
to our COMSOL simulations, is well approximated by
that of a regular parallel plate capacitor, even where the
membrane is slightly bent towards the gate. This capac-
itor conﬁguration enables driving vibrations electrically
[47]. Coherent drive is achieved by applying a dc volt-
age Vdc and an oscillating voltage of peak amplitude V
and frequency fd between the membrane and the gate.
The resulting driving force at fd has a peak amplitude
C (cid:48)VdcV , with C (cid:48) = dC/dz being the derivative of C
≈
with respect to ﬂexural displacement in the direction ˆz
(Fig. 1b). Bandpass ﬁltering of the output of the sig-
nal generator that delivers the oscillating voltage ensures
that harmonics and spurs below and above fd are atten-
uated. The resonator is kept at room temperature in a
vacuum of

6 mbar [48].

Flexural vibrations are measured optically using a
setup ﬁrst reported in [49, 50] and ﬁrst employed with
FLG resonators in [20]. Brieﬂy, the resonator is placed
in an optical standing wave from which it periodically
absorbs energy as it vibrates [51]. The standing wave is
formed by the superposition of an incident wave origi-
nating from a helium-neon laser and the wave reﬂected
by the gate electrode acting as a mirror. As a function
of time t, the intensity of reﬂected light Ir(t) is modu-
lated near the resonant frequency of vibrations by the
amount of energy that the membrane periodically ab-
sorbs [48, 51]. For a fully reﬂective gate electrode, the
amplitude of this modulation reads Ir(t)

We measure Vpd(t) with SDR dongles. We have used
both RTL-SDR Blog V3 by RTL-SDR Blog and NESDR
Smart V4 by Nooelec [13], and obtained quantitatively
similar results. To explain our measurement protocol, we
ﬁnd it helpful to ﬁrst brieﬂy describe the basic principle
of operation of these SDR dongles (Fig. 1c and [2]). The
front-end of a dongle acts as a heterodyne receiver. The
analog RF signal from the photodetector output is am-
pliﬁed with a low noise ampliﬁer. The ampliﬁed signal is

fed to a tuner that selects a band about 2.8 MHz wide
and downconverts it to an intermediary frequency (IF)
fIF = 3.57 MHz. This downconversion is performed with
an analog mixer and a voltage-controlled oscillator of
tunable frequency ftuner. The downconverted frequency
band centered at fIF is further low-pass ﬁltered and am-
pliﬁed and then digitized at a rate fADC = 28.8 MHz.
The digitized IF signal is fed to a complex digital mixer
which downconverts it into a complex baseband signal
near 0 Hz. The I and Q components of this complex base-
band signal are important because they help preserve the
integrity of the downconverted spectrum, which has both
positive and negative frequency components. The base-
band signal is low-pass ﬁltered to reduce its bandwidth
and then decimated, allowing it to be resampled at a rate
fS that is much lower than fADC. This decimated base-
band signal is sent to the computer. In its simplest form,
and in the case of a voltage ampliﬁcation factor of 1, SDR
transforms an input signal H(t) = H cos(2πfdt + φ) into

ment process, from the transduction of a driving force

cessing in software, is schematically depicted in Fig. 1d.
Prior to measuring the response of our graphene res-
onator, we characterize the intrinsic frequency stability
of the output signal of one of our SDRs. We estimate
this stability from the Allan variance of fractional fre-
quency ﬂuctuations in the output signal. To the best
of our knowledge, this characterization has not been re-
ported thus far. However, it is needed for resonant de-
tection schemes based on SDR. Fig. 2a shows I(t) and
Q(t) components of the decimated baseband signal in
the simple case where a harmonic input signal at fre-
quency fin = 41 MHz is applied to the SDR. The input
signal is supplied by a low amplitude noise, low phase
noise generator (N5181B by Keysight). We have previ-
ously calibrated the output amplitude of the SDR us-
ing the signal generator as an input and veriﬁed that
the SDR built-in ampliﬁers are operating in their linear
regime. We have also measured I and Q with a 50 Ohm
matched attenuator at the SDR input to prevent stand-
ing waves from building up between the generator and
SDR, and have not observed any change in the quality
of the output signal. We acquire data with our MAT-
LAB code based on open source drivers [54]. Deﬁning

Q(t) oscillate harmonically at frequency
20 Hz and are
in quadrature, as expected. We then set ∆f = 100 Hz
(the actual oscillation frequency is oﬀ by a few Hz on
average) and continuously sample I and Q. Using deci-
mation at fS as our time base and detecting zero crossing
times in I(t), we build an array of instantaneous periods
N. From this array, we build the time-error

Fig. 1b shows that the output of the photodetector is
split into two paths, each of which is connected to the
SMA (SubMiniature version A) port of one SDR. We use
one of these to measure the response of the ﬁrst (lowest

The true advantage of SDR technology may be best ap-

SDR dongles. For example, such a composite would be

useful in a mass sensing experiment. There, monitoring
the amplitude of at least two vibrational modes in paral-
lel, that is, measuring multiple modes ‘at the same time’,
makes it possible to identify both the mass of the adsor-
bate and the location of the adsorption site on the res-
onator [43]. In those experiments [42, 44], two modes are
measured using two lock-in ampliﬁers, enabling low noise
vector measurements of the modal responses. If, instead,
it is suﬃcient to measure the magnitude of the responses,
then a composite of SDR dongles oﬀers an alternative

channel. Here, we justify this idea not by adding mass to
the resonator, but by modulating strain within the res-
onator and monitoring changes in response amplitude.
Fig. 4a shows the frequency response of the ﬁrst mode
measured with SDR at 3 diﬀerent gate voltages Vdc. The
2.4 MHz/V
resonant frequency f0 changes by df0/dVdc ≈
due to stretching of the membrane by the electrostatic
force. This suggests the experiment schematically de-
picted in Fig. 4b, where we set the driving frequency
fd = fprobe slightly oﬀ resonance for a given value of
Vdc (gray dashed line), modulate Vdc between two levels
above and below this value (upper panel, blue and red
lines), and expect resulting modulations of R(t) at fprobe
(lower panel). For this experiment, we split the output
of the photodetector (Fig. 1b), connect each split path to
one SDR dongle, and connect the two dongles to a single
computer. Each dongle acts a server that streams data
using the Transmission Control Protocol; it is controlled
by our MATLAB code (Appendix C). To probe the lin-
ear response at two diﬀerent frequencies f (cid:48)d and f (cid:48)(cid:48)d , we
use two synchronized signal generators and make the car-
rier frequency of each one equal to the center frequency
ftuner + fIF of one dongle. At both f (cid:48)d and f (cid:48)(cid:48)d , driving
voltages incident on the resonator have the same peak
amplitude V = 22.4 mV.

×

We ﬁrst measure the response of the ﬁrst vibrational
mode near 48 MHz (Mode 1) and that of the second
mode near 80 MHz (Mode 2) in parallel at Vdc = 11 V.
Stepping f (cid:48)d and f (cid:48)(cid:48)d together, sampling each mode at
105 S/s and averaging R(t) measured by each
fS = 2.5
dongle for 1 s yields the responses shown in Fig. 4c. For
each pair (f (cid:48)d, f (cid:48)(cid:48)d ), the signal from Mode 1 and that from
Mode 2 are received together. This technique has allowed
us to identify occasional mechanical instabilities in the
resonator, whereby sudden changes in amplitude would
be observed in both modes at the same time. If the two
modes are measured separately in time, one measured re-
sponse may appear to be anomalous while the other may
appear as regular, even though both responses have been
aﬀected by the instability.

±

We then measure the responses in the presence of mod-
ulated Vdc.
In Fig. 4d, we set f (cid:48)d below resonance of
Mode 1 and f (cid:48)(cid:48)d above resonance of Mode 1 at Vdc = 11 V,
both within the bandwidth of the mode (pair of vertical
dashed lines in panel c). We then modulate Vdc peri-
odically by ∆Vdc =
0.35 V above and below 11 V.
This results in a modulation of the resonant frequency
106 Hz that periodi-
∆f0 = ∆Vdcdf0/dVdc =
±
cally shifts the response in frequency. Correspondingly,
R(t) measured at each driving frequency is amplitude
modulated by an amount ∆R
dR/dfd. Because
the response is probed below and above resonance, the
two traces in panel (d) are anticorrelated. It is also inter-
esting to estimate how ‘simultaneous’ these time traces
for the upper trace
are. We ﬁnd that maxima in
and those for the lower trace occur within
1 ms of each
other (Appendix D). This time scale is also the rise time

of Vdc steps at the output of the bias tee in Fig. 1b. It
would be suﬃciently short for mass sensing experiments
in vacuum, where adsorption events have been shown to
occur ever few seconds [60]. Fig. 4e shows the response of
Mode 1 (upper panel) and that of Mode 2 (lower panel).
f (cid:48)d is set below resonance of Mode 1, f (cid:48)(cid:48)d is set below res-
onance of Mode 2 (vertical dashed lines below 48 MHz
and below 80 MHz in panel c), and ∆Vdc =
0.5 V (near
1.6 MHz/V, where f1 is the
Vdc = 11 V, df1/dVdc ≈
resonant frequency of Mode 2: see Appendix E). Time
traces in panel (e) clearly show that the two modes are
simultaneously modiﬁed by a change in strain (the two
traces are correlated). Overall, panel (e) substantiates
the idea that multiple modes can be measured in parallel
with a composite of SDR dongles, provided that the in-
put signal is large enough that it can be split among the
dongles.

±

Finally, to complement our software-based measure-
ment approach, we demonstrate that SDR can be em-
ployed to extract information encoded in the optical ﬁeld
by the vibrations of our resonator. Here, information en-
coding is performed by driving the resonator with a fre-
quency modulated (FM) voltage waveform Vin(t) whose
instantaneous frequency finst is time dependent. The lat-
ter reads finst(t) = f0 + f∆u(t), where f∆ is the fre-
quency deviation and u(t) is the baseband signal to be
encoded. To create u(t), we use a digital audio recording
of a song performed by one of the authors (J. Wang).
A similar experiment was reported in [45], with three
diﬀerences: information was encoded into an electrome-
chanical signal instead of an optomechanical signal; an
analog hardware demodulator was used instead of SDR
and software; pop music was played instead of an unpro-
cessed human voice. Our recording is fed from the output
of the computer sound card to the input of a voltage-
controlled oscillator used as a baseband frequency mod-
ulator in our signal generator. We use a driving voltage
of peak amplitude V = 25 mV that is low enough to
keep the resonator in its linear regime and large enough
to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio at the SDR out-
put. We set f∆ = 40 kHz, which is large enough to
encode most of the frequency components of the audio
signal and yet much smaller than the linewidth of the
mechanical response. We set ftuner + fIF close to the res-
onance of the ﬁrst mode. On the computer, we digitally
ﬁlter I and Q with a 100 kHz-wide bandpass ﬁlter and
digitally demodulate them to extract the audio baseband
with our GNU Radio code (Appendix F). Fig. 5a displays
an excerpt from Vin(t), normalized to its maximum am-
plitude, taken from the original audio recording. Fig. 5b
represents the corresponding excerpt Vout(t), normalized
to its maximum amplitude, extracted from the demod-
ulated signal. Fig. 5c shows the diﬀerence between the
two waveforms. The latter is small, indicating that the
baseband signal encoded in the mechanical vibrations is
faithfully imprinted in the intensity of reﬂected light and
is properly recovered with our software-based signal pro-
cessing technique. The original recording in mp3 format

rived from a traditional ditty named “Wuxi Jing” that

modulated signal in mp3 format can also be heard in

signals, including poetry by Shakespeare and an excerpt

IV. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY

Having shown that our composite of SDRs can be used
to measure the driven vibrations of a few-layer graphene
resonator at room temperature, we now address the suit-
ability of our approach for measuring them at low tem-
perature. The dynamics of these resonators at low tem-
perature is interesting in part because their quality factor
Q increases as temperature decreases [21]. This is ad-
vantageous to resonant sensing. For example, the small-
est mass and the smallest force detectable in a resonant
1/2. However,
experiment are both proportional to Q−
measuring vibrations at low temperature is challenging
because the probe signal must be weak enough for the
resonator not to heat up. Many of those low temper-
ature measurements reported thus far are based on an
electrical technique ﬁrst employed at room temperature

≈

in [47]. There, the probe signal is an oscillating voltage
Vsd(t) applied between the source and drain electrodes of
the resonator, which takes the role of the incident opti-
cal wave in our study. The magnitude of the measured
mechanical response is proportional to
. In [61],
Vsd(t)
|
|
the weakest driven vibrational amplitude that can be re-
solved at 10 mK with this technique is measured as a
1 nVrms (Fig. 1c in [61], where an
voltage of amplitude
electromechanical current of smallest amplitude
1 pA
is converted into a voltage using a 2 kOhm resistor).
With regard to our Fig. 3c, 1 nVrms is 5,000 smaller
than the noise ﬂoor of SDR. Scaling temperature and
probe signal amplitude accordingly suggests that mea-
surements near
50 K may be possible with SDR. Mea-
surements at lower temperatures would require more ad-
vanced and somewhat costlier SDRs. A promising can-
didate is SDRlab 122-16 produced by Red Pitaya [62].

We quantify the dynamics of the ﬁrst vibrational mode
of our resonator by ﬁtting its measured frequency re-
sponse to Eq. 2. The peak amplitude of the driving

derivative of the capacitance between the membrane and
the gate (obtained with COMSOL), Vdc is a dc voltage
and V is the peak amplitude of an oscillating voltage,
both applied between the membrane and the gate. We
set Vdc = 11 V. Driving voltages used in Fig. A2, from
bottom curve to top curve, are V = 0.22, 2.24, 11.19,
22.39, 33.58 and 44.77 mV; these are peak voltage am-
plitudes which account for the full reﬂection of voltage
waves incident on the resonator due to impedance mis-
match. Blue dotted curves (resp. red curves) in Fig. A2

software-based instrumentation that is accessible to ev-
eryone. We show that SDR dongles combined with simple
data processing on a computer can be used to measure
the driven response of a nanomechanical resonator based
on few-layer graphene. Our measurements enable quan-
titative analysis of the mode dynamics. Two vibrational
modes can be measured in parallel. Information encoded
in modulated vibrations and transduced into light in-
tensity modulations can be readily extracted. Looking
ahead, a more elaborate and improved setup may be
built upon our simple system. The computer used in our
setup, an aging and sluggish laptop, may be replaced with
a single board computer such as a Raspberry Pi. Rapid
progress in SDR technology is expected to lower the mea-
surement noise ﬂoor [62], a prerequisite for the sensitive
detection of force and mass and for all resonant mea-
surements based on nanomechanics at cryogenic temper-
atures. In addition, future SDRs are expected to perform
digital-to-analog conversion directly at the RF front-end
and downconvert the sampled signal to baseband with-
out the need for an IF stage, making measurements faster
and cleaner. With regard to multiple channel measure-
ments, arrays of SDRs with synchronized clocks will en-
able new applications such as phase-coherent multichan-
nel transceivers [63], which may also prove useful to study
arrays of coupled nanomechanical resonators [64–66].

Appendix A: Frequency stability of low phase noise
signal generator

We estimate the frequency stability of the signal gen-
erator (N5181B with low phase noise option by Keysight)
from its phase noise spectrum Sφφ(f ) at carrier frequency
ν0 = 100 MHz, where f is Fourier frequency (Fig. A1).
The frequency stability is given by the minimum value of
the Allan variance of fractional frequency ﬂuctuations,
[σ2
y]min. The latter is reached where frequency ﬂicker
dominates frequency noise [67]. Frequency ﬂicker noise

respect to time dR/dt in Fig. A4, upper panel. The lower
panel shows the delay between a peak in dR/dt of one
data set and the nearest dip in dR/dt of the other data
set, yielding a delay of about 1 ms.

The resonant frequency of Mode 1, f0, and that of
Mode 2, f1, are shown as a function of gate voltage
Vdc in Fig. A5. Near Vdc = 11 V, we ﬁnd df0/dVdc ≈
2.4 MHz/V and df1/dVdc ≈

1.6 MHz/V.

Appendix F: GNU Radio ﬂowgraph used to
demodulate frequency-modulated photodetector
output

Demodulation of frequency-modulated (FM) signals is
a basic function in the GNU Radio environment [68].
We built the ﬂowgraph depicted in Fig. A6 by follow-
ing GNU Radio tutorials [69]. We use this ﬂowgraph to
demodulate FM optomechanical signals at the output of
our photodetector. Its principle of operation goes as fol-
lows. RTL-SDR Source sets parameters for the SDR don-
gle, including center frequency ftuner + fIF = 48 MHz,
sampling rate fS = 2 MHz, RF gain (before downcon-
version to IF), and IF gain (BB gain is for a device
called Hack RF which we do not use). I and Q wave-
forms at the output of RTL-SDR Source are low-pass ﬁl-
tered using Low Pass Filter (100 kHz cutoﬀ frequency,
transition width of 1 kHz from pass-band to stop-band).
A Hamming window is used to build this low-pass ﬁl-
ter; the shape factor beta is used only with a Kaiser

ulated waveform is more uniform across the audio fre-
quency range. The demodulated waveform is decimated
by Rational Resampler. The sampling rate f (RR)
of the
waveform at the output of this block is the sampling rate
at the output of FM Demod multiplied by Interpolation
and divided by Decimation, so that f (RR)
103 Hz.
Multiply Const scales the amplitude of the waveform
at the output of Rational Resampler. Num Items in
Head is set to the time length of the song (the ana-
log input whose duration is about 3 min) multiplied by
f (RR)
. Audio Sink sends the resulting waveform to the
S
sound card of the computer at a rate of 48 kHz = f (RR)
.
File Sink saves the audio ﬁle in binary format. We con-
vert the latter into wav format with MATLAB, then we
convert the .wav ﬁle into mp3 format using Audacity [70].

window. The ﬁltered waveforms are decimated (down-
sampled) by a factor of 5, so they are sampled at a
105 Hz. FM Demod demodulates
rate of 2
the ﬁltered I and Q waveforms. The sampling rate of
this block matches the decimated sampling rate of the
low-pass ﬁltered waveforms. We use a frequency devia-
tion of 40 kHz that encompasses the frequency range of
the analog audio signal. The demodulated waveform is
low-pass ﬁltered. A de-emphasis ﬁlter with a response
time τ = 75 µs is used to attenuate high frequency
components, so the signal-to-noise ratio of the demod-
