Abstract—The broadcasting nature of the wireless medium
makes exposure to eavesdroppers a potential threat. Physical
Layer Security (PLS) has been widely recognized as a promising
security measure complementary to encryption. It has recently
been demonstrated that PLS can be implemented using off-the-
shelf equipment by spectrum-programming enhanced Software-
Deﬁned Networking (SDN), where a network controller is able
to execute intelligent access point (AP) selection algorithms such
that PLS can be achieved and secrecy capacity optimized. In
this paper we provide a basic system model for such implemen-
tations. We also introduce a novel secrecy capacity optimization
algorithm, in which we combine intelligent AP selection with the
addition of Friendly Jamming (FJ) by the not-selected AP.

I. INTRODUCTION

Society has become unthinkable without wireless devices.
We have become reliant on wireless communication tech-
nologies to exchange personal and sometimes conﬁdential
data. The broadcasting nature of the wireless medium makes
exposure to eavesdroppers a potential threat. So far, this threat
has mostly been mitigated by encrypting the wireless link
and the information transmitted. Such a solution assumes that
eavesdroppers lack the computational resources and knowl-
edge of the network parameters to break the encryption.
While this assumption still hold for many scenarios today,
eavesdroppers’ capabilities are rapidly improving.

the physical

Physical Layer Security (PLS) has been widely recognized
as a promising complementary security measure. PLS limits
the information that can be intercepted at the bit-level by
making it impossible for an eavesdropper to decode any data
at
layer [1]. If executed well, PLS can thus
provide perfect secrecy. Until recently, implementing PLS in
a practical and cost-effective way was a challenge [2]. Most
techniques proposed in the literature involve major signal-
processing efforts to scramble the communication channel ef-
fectively for the eavesdropper while simultaneously optimizing
the throughput for the legitimate station.

In recent work [3], we demonstrated that PLS can be
realized using off-the-shelf equipment by tackling the problem
at
the network-level. The idea is that a wireless network
typically contains not just one wireless access point (AP),
but many APs to which a legitimate station could possibly
connect. Using a relatively new enhancement of Software-
Deﬁned Networking (SDN) speciﬁcally for wireless networks,
called spectrum programming [4], it is now possible to execute

intelligent AP selection algorithms in a way that is completely
transparent to the connecting station. We investigated two
such algorithms in earlier work. In [3], we had the legitimate
station always connect to the AP that is least beneﬁcial to the
eavesdropper, and in [5] the AP was selected that maximized
the secrecy capacity for the legitimate station. The secrecy
capacity is the maximum capacity a legitimate station can
achieve under the condition of full secrecy while connected
to a given AP.

In this paper, after discussing related work in section II,
we provide a basic system model of the proof-of-concept
described in [3]. The model enables us to introduce a novel
secrecy capacity optimization algorithm, described in section
IV, in which we combine intelligent AP selection based on
maximizing secrecy capacity [5] with the addition of Friendly
Jamming (FJ) by the not-selected AP. In section V we show
that providing such a FJ signal to the eavesdroppers signiﬁ-
cantly improves secrecy in the network beyond what can be
achieved with intelligent AP selection. Although the concepts
of AP selection and FJ have been suggested earlier in isolation,
this is the ﬁrst time they are combined and supported by
a single robust theoretical framework, and in section VI we
discuss its applicability in realistic networks.

II. RELATED WORK

Techniques proposed in the literature to achieve PLS can be
categorized as Channel Coding techniques, Channel Control
techniques, Power Control techniques, and Artiﬁcial Noise
(AN) techniques. Channel coding techniques introduce robust
coding schemes and randomization in the transmitted signal to
make it difﬁcult for eavesdroppers to decode the intercepted
signal [6], [7]. Channel Control focuses on manipulating
the radio channel parameter and monitoring the channel to
detect the presence of eavesdroppers [8], [9]. Power Control
techniques try to achieve secrecy by controlling the power
and direction of the signal transmitted to increase the capacity
at
the
the legitimate station and degrade the capacity at
eavesdropper, for instance by using multiple antennas [10].
AN techniques, which could also be considered as power
control techniques, aim to generate jamming signals to achieve
PLS especially in situations where the eavesdropper is closer
to the source than the legitimate station. AN-based PLS has
been investigated extensively as an approach to achieve PLS
for wireless communications. Early work in this area focused
on providing AN-based PLS with partial or no knowledge

of the Channel State Information (CSI) at the legitimate and
eavesdropping stations [11]–[14].

These techniques have typically approached the problem at
the link-level, focusing on the individual wireless connections
between sender and receiver and, so far, have proven to be
very hard, if not impossible, to implement. Our earlier work, as
presented in [5] and [3], shows a solution by approaching the
problem at the network-level using multiple APs and intelli-
gent AP selection. The solution takes advantage of SDN-based
spectrum programming as presented in [4], where an enhanced
programmable controller has full, up-to-date knowledge of the
CSI across the network, and has ﬁne-grained control over the
radio parameters of each AP.

In this paper, we show that secrecy in the network can be
improved by providing a FJ signal to the eavesdroppers. The
idea of FJ in itself is not new. Work presented in [15] and
[16] propose an architecture to help realize PLS where two
APs, namely AP1 and AP2, are deployed with the legitimate
station transmitting data to AP1. During this transmission, AP2
sends a pre-determined signal to AP1, which will act as a
jamming signal to any eavesdropping station in the vicinity
of the communication. More recent contributions proposing
the orchestration of system-level interference to achieve PLS
use new techniques such as intelligent reﬂecting surface [17]
and non-orthogonal multiple access [18]. These contributions
are all limited to the theoretical domain and do not offer a
practical approach to implement the proposed solutions. The
novelty of our work lies in enhancing secrecy by combining
intelligent AP selection with orchestrated network-controlled
generation of FJ in a way that suits today’s hardware and
software, supported by a robust theoretical framework.

III. SYSTEM MODEL

We here consider a wireless system model as shown in
Figure 1, where a legitimate station is trying to connect to, and
receive information from, a wireless network in the presence of
an eavesdropping station. The remainder of the paper assumes
the network to be based on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, but the concept
can easily be generalized to other wireless networks.

It is known that PLS can, in theory, be achieved when the
Shannon capacity of the legitimate station is higher than the
Shannon capacity of the eavesdropping station (under a range
of conditions as laid out in [1]). Without loss of generality, we
assume downstream trafﬁc, i.e., from one of the Wi-Fi APs to
the legitimate station. This is reasonable for situations where
conﬁdential information is provided by servers in the network
and is only offered for consumption to legitimate clients.

Consider a scenario where there are two APs (denoted by
AP1 and AP2), one legitimate station (denoted by STAm)
and an eavesdropper (denoted by STAe). We employ the
AP selection mechanism proposed in [5] that exploits the
principles of PLS to assign the AP that can provide the highest
secrecy capacity for STAm. To better explain the AP selection
mechanism, a summary of the notation used in this paper is
presented in Table I. We assume that the location of the APs,
STAm and STAe are known. The latter is of course hard when

Figure 1: Network-level PLS: the legitimate station STAm is con-
nected to the AP that can provide the best secrecy capacity in the
presence of an eavesdropper STAe.

the eavesdropper is passive, but various proposals have been
made in the literature to overcome this problem (see, e.g.,
[19]). We will discuss this further in Section VI. For simplicity
of exposition, we will model the channel between the APs and
both stations using a path loss model [20]. Our optimization
method is, however, extendable to the case where block-fading
CSI is available at the spectrum programming controller.

where all logs are in base 2 and, therefore, capacities are
measured in bits/s. The terms In,m and In,e measure the
interference experienced at STAm and STAe, respectively, as
further elaborated in Section IV.

Based on the principles of PLS, STAm can securely commu-
nicate with APn if Cn,m > Cn,e. The proposed AP selection
mechanism in [5] then connects STAm to the AP that provides
the maximum secrecy capacity (i.e., maximum Cn,m − Cn,e
value among AP choices n = 1 or n = 2). Thus, the secrecy
capacity is maximized through ﬁnding the solution

i = arg max

n∈{1,2}

(Cn,m − Cn,e).

Therefore, APi is the selected AP for transmission of infor-
mation to STAm. The other access point APj, j (cid:54)= i is “idle”,
as far as data trafﬁc is concerned.

IV. PROPOSED FRIENDLY JAMMING

We here propose to have the not-selected AP in (3) (which
may also call idle AP) generating an optimal Friendly Jam-
ming (FJ) signal, in addition to employing the AP selection
mechanism described in Section III. The idle APj tries to jam
STAe to reduce its SINR, which in turns reduces the channel
capacity of the eavesdropper (Ce,n) and, therefore, improves
the secrecy capacity of STAm. For ease of exposition, we
assume that STAe and STAm have the same noise powers
for their receivers, i.e. N = Nm = Ne. We also assume that
at the time of AP selection based on the mechanism in (3), the
ambient interference (without FJ generation) was zero. In our
problem formulation and subsequent performance evaluation,
this will allow us to evaluate the improvement from optimal FJ
generation compared to a baseline system (which is free from
ambient/extra interference) in a meaningful way. However,
the method presented below can be extended to cater for the
general case.

Given the above, the interference experienced by STAm

and STAe from the FJ generating APj is Pjd−α

The goal here is to ﬁnd the optimal interference power
transmitted from APj, i.e. the optimal Pj, to maximize the
secrecy capacity of the downlink transmission from APi to
STAm. In order to achieve that, we ﬁx the power for the
main data APi, Pi, and ﬁnd the optimal Pj that maximizes

V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithm in MatLab. We simulated three Wi-Fi systems: a) a
normal Wi-Fi system where STAm is associated to the AP with
the highest SINR regardless of the eavesdropper’s location; b)
the smart AP system based on [5] where STAm is associated
to APi that provides the highest secrecy capacity according to
(3); and c) the enhanced smart AP where the idle access point
APj generates FJ to increase the secrecy of communication
between STAm and APi according to (12).

tn

We consider a 120m × 120m environment and all coordi-
nates are expressed in meter (m). The two APs are located at
positions (40, 60) and (80, 60) and operate at f0 = 2.4 GHz.
The AP associated to STAm uses a ﬁxed transmit power of
Pi = 50 mW. When the idle APj is used to introduce FJ, we
assume P max
= 50 mW. The noise power at both STAm and
STAe is N = Nm = Ne = −70 dBm = 10−10 W. A path
loss exponent of α = 2 and a reference distance d0 = 1m
are assumed for the entire map. Then, for a ﬁxed location of
STAm, we run the simulation and for each potential location
of STAe, we ﬁrst select the AP to associate with STAm based
on one of the above three methods and then calculate the
secrecy capacity Ci,m − Ci,e, eavesdropping capacity Ci,e,
and the coverage ratio. The latter is the ratio of the area with
positive secrecy capacity and the total area of the map, i.e. all
locations where the eavesdropper may be located. We repeat
the simulations for three different scenarios where STAm is
located at position (20, 100) (scenario 1), (80, 20) (scenario
2) and (60, 38) (scenario 3). The results are visualized as a
map in Figure 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

For scenario 1, Figure 2a shows for the “normal Wi-Fi” how
STAm associates to the AP with the highest received SINR,
which is the nearest one. If STAe positions itself closer to
this APi, it will be located in the white area, which means
that no secrecy can be achieved for STAm. In Figure 2d
this shows as a secrecy capacity of 0 (zero), i.e. dark blue.
Outside this circle, the secrecy capacity is greater than zero.
Figure 2b and 2e illustrate the results for the AP selection
algorithm of [5]. The type of shading (horizontal or vertical
lines) indicates which AP STAm is connected to, given the
location of STAe, such that the secrecy capacity is maximized.

Again, if STAe is in the white area, no secrecy can be achieved,
regardless of which AP STAm is connected to. But this area
is now signiﬁcantly smaller than in Figure 2a, showing the
effectiveness of the algorithm in [5]. When we now add FJ,
the white area almost disappears, as shown in Figure 2c. This
means that, for this scenario, secrecy can be achieved almost
everywhere. Figure 2f shows that, in this case, the secrecy
capacity for STAm has also increased signiﬁcantly for most
locations of STAe.

Results for two other locations of STAm (i.e. scenario 2 and
scenario 3) are presented in Figure 3 and 4. From these results
we can draw the same conclusions as for scenario 1.

For all three scenarios, Figure 5 illustrates the FJ power that
is generated by APj to optimize the capacity and enhance
the secrecy coverage. In our simulations, given a constant
transmit power of 17 dBm for APi, the FJ power of APj
is about 5-10 dBm for the most of potential locations of the
eavesdropper to optimize the secrecy capacity for STAm. In
contrast, optimal secrecy can be achieved without jamming
when the eavesdropper is located on the edge area of the map.
Next, for every scenario and for every algorithm, we cal-
culated the average secrecy capacity and the average eaves-
dropper’s capacity for all possible locations of STAe. Let
STAm and STAe be located at (xm, ym) and (x, y), respec-
tively. The channel capacity of STAm and STAe can then
be represented as Ci,m(x, y|xm, ym) and Ci,e(x, y|xm, ym),
respectively, where x, y ∈ {1, 2, ..., K},
i.e. we vary the
location of STAe in steps of 1 m in horizontal or vertical
directions. This yields the average secrecy capacity

We then repeated the simulation for 10,000 random loca-

tions of STAm.

Using (13) and (14), Figure 6 shows the average secrecy
capacity for STAm, the average secrecy coverage ratio, and
the average eavesdropper’s capacity for the three individual
scenarios. The Overall Average shows the results averaged
over 10,000 locations for STAm. The color indicates the
secrecy capacity optimization algorithm. The results show
that the conclusions from Figure 2 can be well generalized
to all other locations of STAm. It also shows that adding
FJ signiﬁcantly increases the average secrecy capacity while
signiﬁcantly decreasing the average eavesdropper’s capacity.
But, arguably, the most interesting result is that the area where
no secrecy can be achieved has reduced to almost zero.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

looking at the problem at the level of a programmable network.

For a scenario with only two APs controlled by a spectrum-
programming enhanced SDN controller, we have shown
that perfect secrecy and optimized secrecy capacity can be
achieved by means of network-enabled PLS, for nearly every
location of the passive eavesdropper, by intelligently combin-
ing AP selection for the legitimate station and the generation
of FJ by the idle AP. This is an important result, as until now,
the applicability of PLS in real networks has greatly suffered
under the complexity of its implementation and the inability to
secure the network for too many locations of an eavesdropper.
Our work shows that both limitations can be overcome by

In future work, we will optimize the model and the system
further by adding more APs, more legitimate stations, and
more eavesdroppers. It can be intuitively understood that a
larger scale and a higher density of the wireless network
provides more opportunities to further optimize AP selection
as well as the generation of FJ. We also intend to validate our
simulation results with our testbed as described in [3]. There
are also many opportunities to improve the algorithms further.
For instance, we here optimized the secrecy capacity by AP
selection and FJ in a serial manner: ﬁrst AP selection, then
FJ. The next step is to optimize both mechanisms jointly. The

achieved by moving the AP closer to the STAm. However, the
STAe may still be able to decode the signal unless link-level
measures are being applied in addition.

Figure 6: The average secrecy capacity for STAm, the average
secrecy coverage ratio, and the average eavesdropper’s capacity, for
the three individual scenarios. The Overall Average shows the results
averaged over 10,000 locations for STAm. The color indicates the
secrecy capacity optimization algorithm.

model may also extended by the inclusion of other techniques
such as multiple antennae, beamforming and network coding.
Throughout this paper, we have assumed that the eavesdrop-
per’s channel condition is known, and therefore its location.
This is particularly hard when the eavesdropper is passive.
To mitigate this, we will investigate if we can consider the
physical boundaries of the network, for instance an enterprise
building or apartment block. This makes it possible to distin-
guish insider threats from external eavesdroppers, and to make
statistical estimates for the likely locations of the external
eavesdroppers. We will also investigate the use of effective
eavesdropper detection tools such as Ghostbuster [19], which
make use of the fact that even passive receivers leak RF
signals, which can be integrated into the spectral programming
architecture.

We will also look at cases where upstream trafﬁc needs
to be conﬁdential too. The relevant eavesdropper’s Shannon
capacity is then between STAe and STAm. This is outside
the control of the spectrum programming architecture, unless
