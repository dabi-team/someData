Abstract.  Benchmarking  and  monitoring  urban  design  and  transport  features  is 
critical to achieving local and international health and sustainability goals. However, 
most urban indicator frameworks use coarse spatial scales that only allow between-city 
comparisons  or  require  expensive,  technical,  local  spatial  analyses  for  within-city 
comparisons.  This  study  developed  a  reusable  open-source  urban 
indicator 
computational  framework  using  open  data  to  enable  consistent  local  and  global 
comparative  analyses.  We  demonstrate  this  framework  by  calculating  spatial 
indicators—for  25  diverse  cities  in  19  countries—of  urban  design  and  transport 
features that support health and sustainability. We link these indicators to cities’ policy 
contexts  and  identify  populations  living  above  and  below  critical  thresholds  for 
physical activity through walking. Efforts to broaden participation in crowdsourcing 
data and to calculate globally consistent indicators are essential for planning evidence-
informed urban interventions, monitoring policy impacts, and learning lessons from 
peer cities to achieve health, equity, and sustainability goals. 

1. Introduction 

The policies that determine cities’ urban form, land use patterns, and transport 
opportunities in turn determine health and sustainability. Creating healthier and more 
sustainable cities is a global priority integral to achieving the United Nations’ (UN) 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 
health equity goals.1 Various indicator frameworks have been proposed to monitor progress 
towards such ends. However, most existing frameworks rely on citywide measures and focus 
on comparisons between cities. While such comparisons are useful for determining 
priorities and interventions at the international and national levels, within-city (i.e., 
neighbourhood-level) comparisons are key to unlocking the full potential of city planning 
to unmask and attenuate local urban health inequities.2,3

Box 1: Limitations of current guidelines for developing consistent spatial 
indicators 

There are various guidelines for developing health and sustainability indicators, but each 
has limitations. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an 
independent non-governmental organisation established in 1946 to develop consensus-
based, market-relevant international standards to help solve global challenges. Its 
ISO37120 standard proposes indicators for city services and quality of life that can track 
and monitor city performance over time.5 ISO advocates for standardised indicators to 
provide a uniform approach to what is measured and how that measurement is 
undertaken. However, its framework stops short of recommending targets, and it does 
not deal with the difficulties involved in sourcing necessary (and consistent) data. 
Further, the indicators tend to be citywide rather than neighbourhood-scale, limiting 
capacity for within-city comparisons. 

For example, the ISO indicator for public transport access (19.6 – Percentage of 
population living within 0.5 km of public transit running at least every 20 minutes during 
peak periods) suggests a single citywide measure and does not stipulate potential data 
sources or a target for the percentage of the population served at this level. The indicator 
makes no reference to the spatial boundary used to determine the population catchment, 
nor does it stipulate whether the distance threshold for evaluating access should be 
measured using Euclidean distance or transport network traversal. Depending on the 
network’s connectivity, Euclidean distance often overestimates access. Thus, two 
analysts independently measuring the same city at the same time may generate 
substantially different results. 

The UN Habitat’s New Urban Agenda Monitoring Framework is more 

comprehensive and addresses barriers to consistently measure and compare cities.6 
Taking a similar public transport indicator as an example (14. Proportion of the 
population that has convenient access to public transport disaggregated by age group, sex, 
and persons with disabilities), UN Habitat provides seven pages of guidance on how the 
indicator should be constructed and possible data sources. However, it suggests only a 
citywide measure and remains silent on targets. 

1.1. Within-city versus between-city spatial indicators 

Maps can help local and regional planners reveal the spatial distribution of health-
promoting infrastructure and amenities within cities (e.g., walkable streets, public 
transport, daily living needs, green spaces) and identify inequities in access. Mapped 
neighbourhood-level spatial indicators facilitate comparisons within cities, highlight 
resource distribution and areas needing interventions, encourage accountability, and 
empower communities to advocate for improvements.4 Growing access to big data and 
high-powered computing enables neighbourhood-level spatial indicators to be developed 
and disseminated more readily. 

Urban policy targets are often set at a citywide level (e.g., percentage of city 
population with access to amenities).3 Neighbourhood-level spatial indicators help planners 
identify differences in access to urban design and transport features that support healthy 

2 

 
 
 
and sustainable lifestyles, to better target local interventions. However, planners also need a 
means of aggregating consistently measured neighbourhood-level spatial indicators to the 
city scale, in order to compare between cities (benchmarking) and over time (monitoring). 
These are crucial first steps towards achieving urban health and sustainability goals. 
Nevertheless, many prominent indicator guidelines do not address measurement standards, 
indicator targets, or data acquisition (see Box 1). 

1.2. Creating globally applicable city planning spatial indicators 

Creating high-quality, fine-grained spatial indicators to measure progress towards healthy 
and sustainable cities globally presents technical challenges that plague both between- and 
within-city comparisons.7-9 While some cities collect and maintain high-quality,10 fine-
grained data on land use, transport infrastructure, and socioeconomic characteristics, many 
do not. Even when such data exist, they may not be publicly available to researchers and 
practitioners. Researchers undertaking comparative analyses—particularly international 
analyses—must account for region- and dataset-specific inconsistencies in assumptions, 
standards, scales, and timeliness. Data quality varies widely, as do digitisation standards and 
encodings, collection dates, local meanings of transport infrastructure or land use 
classifications, and spatial scales (e.g., defining the “city” as an incorporated municipality, 
urbanised area, or metropolitan area).11  

Lack of access to software, training, and resources also constrains indicator 
creation. Closed-source, proprietary geographic information systems (GIS) are often 
expensive, do not lend themselves to open science or reproducibility, and fit poorly with 
modern data science practices.12 Advanced spatial analysis requires extensive training, but 
such expertise can be uncommon in government agencies and difficult or expensive to 
procure from the private sector. Resource constraints pose a particular challenge in low- 
and middle-income countries (LMICs), where data availability and quality and local 
technical capacity may be lacking. These limitations thwart efforts to develop actionable 
indicators to track the creation of healthy and sustainable urban environments in our 
planet’s most rapidly developing cities and constrain governments’ capacity to develop 
evidence-based policies and monitor their impacts.13  

1.3. A 21st-century approach to calculating spatial indicators 

Given the importance of urban spatial indicators to benchmark and monitor cities and 
inform interventions, a better model for creating indicators would leverage emerging open-
source software and open-data commons to build high-quality, accessible, free tools for 
calculating and visualising such indicators. Open-data sources with global scope offer 
opportunities to measure and analyse urban health and sustainability indicators in diverse 
geographical contexts.14-18 In particular, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a crowdsourced 
mapping project that provides open access to regularly updated spatial data worldwide, 
coded according to consistent and community-led guidelines.19  

This article addresses the need to better measure, map, and compare urban design 
and transport features important for creating healthy and sustainable cities. We present an 
open-source software framework that uses open data to calculate spatial indicators within 
and between cities around the world, including in under-studied and under-resourced 
countries. Then we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of our approach by creating a 

3 

 
cross-sectional snapshot of priority indicators recommended in the first Lancet Series on 
Urban Design, Transport and Health, showing between-city comparisons, and mapping 
within-city spatial inequities.20 We link these to the local policy contexts identified by Lowe 
et al.21 and identify populations living above and below the critical thresholds identified by 
Cerin et al.22 We discuss the practical value of this tool and empirical findings for policy-
making. The article concludes with a call for action: to build healthy and sustainable cities, 
we must measure city-building better and we must build healthy and sustainable cities for 
all—not just for some—by reducing within-city inequities. 

2. Measuring spatial indicators of urban design and 
transport features for healthy and sustainable cities 

2.1. International collaboration network 

The Global Healthy and Sustainable City-Indicators Collaboration comprises a network of 
built environment and health researchers, formed to develop a framework for assessing the 
progress of urban design and transport features that support healthy and sustainable cities. 
The network comprises a core team of multidisciplinary researchers working with local 
experts, including academics and city planners, across 25 cities in 19 lower-middle- to high-
income countries across six world regions (see the appendix for details). Lowe et al.21 
describe the characteristics and sampling methods for these cities. Investigators were 
contacted through international networks and at conferences to volunteer to lead 
participation of cities. 

2.2. Open-source framework 

We developed an open-source software framework to calculate spatial indicators using open 
data at both fine-grained and aggregated levels, supporting within- and between-city 
comparisons, as described in Liu et al.23 Detailed descriptions of these methods, developed 
in conjunction with collaborators, appear in the appendix, including urban study region 
boundary definitions, source data to support comparable analyses of what we define as 
“local neighbourhood” features across the cities, and reproducible workflows for indicator 
estimation. We use the term “neighbourhood” here in a technical sense, referring to a 
walkable catchment within some distance threshold of a residential reference point, rather 
than the colloquial sense of social or political boundaries. We generally defined urban study 
regions using city administrative boundaries and the Global Human Settlements 2015 
urban centres layer24 and we derived pedestrian-accessible street networks and built 
environment features from OSM, with validation conducted with local collaborators. To 
support between-city analyses of urban neighbourhoods, we generated a 250-metre (m) grid 
associated with 2015 population estimates25 to summarise the indicators’ distribution at 
high-resolution for mapping with regard to population. 

For each city, we calculated spatial indicators of urban design and transport 
features that support healthy and sustainable cities.20,26 The following methods and 
definitions are detailed in the appendix. Indicators were calculated for sample points 
generated at regular 30m intervals along the pedestrian street network for populated areas 
in each city’s urban region. These sample points represent an assumed spatial distribution 

4 

 
of dwellings in each city to facilitate the measurement of local neighbourhood 
characteristics. The 1000m (approximately 13-minute walking time27) extent of the 
pedestrian network reachable from each sample point was intersected with the 250m urban 
neighbourhood grid to represent a local walkable catchment area: a computationally 
tractable approximation of the “sausage buffer” method for walkable catchments28,29 as 
described in Liu et al.23 We estimated population and street intersection densities in each 
sample point’s local walkable catchment. The nearest distance to several features—healthy 
food markets, convenience stores, public transport stops, and public open space entry 
points—was estimated for each sample point and evaluated against an accessibility 
threshold5 of 500m using a binary access score (equal to 1 if the estimated access distance 
was within 500m, and 0 otherwise). Access to public transport stops was evaluated against 
three criteria: 1) any; and where transport schedule data were retrievable, 2) average 
weekday daytime service every 30 minutes or less, and 3) serviced every 20 minutes or less. 
Two kinds of public open spaces were measured: 1) any; and 2) larger than 1.5 hectares. 
These public transport and open space typologies are associated with active transport 
behaviours, following those measured by Arundel et al.4 We summarised each sample 
point’s local walkable environment using two composite indicators: 1) a daily living 
score4,30,31 for local access to a mix of amenities (summing equal-weighted binary access 
scores to a healthy food market, a convenience store, and a public transport stop within 
500m); and 2) a local walkability index4,31 that sums equal-weighted standardised scores of 
population density, street intersection density, and daily living score. These measures of 
well-serviced and walkable neighbourhoods are standard in the built environment and 
health literature32,33 with well-established associations with physical activity and walking for 
transport.4,30,31 

Residential point measures were aggregated and averaged to 250m hexagonal cells 

serving as empirically derived “neighbourhoods.” These urban neighbourhoods were the 
spatial units used to characterise the within- and between-city distribution of indicators 1) 
in absolute terms relative to the city (within-city estimates), and 2) relative to all cities via z-
scores (between-city estimates). We conducted a spatial analysis of population and 
intersection density indicators for two physical activity scenarios identified by Cerin et al.22 
Scenario A meets the threshold for 80% probability of walking for transport and Scenario B 
meets the threshold for reaching WHO’s target of a ≥15% relative reduction in insufficient 
physical activity through walking. 

3. How cities performed against the indicators 

3.1. Population access to amenities 

Table 1 presents estimates of the population percentage within a 500m walk to amenities, 
alongside citywide estimates of 2015 transport-sector particulate matter (PM2·5) 
emissions, where available.24 Broad variation exists between cities, but those in middle-
income countries tended to have lower estimates of population access to amenities than 
cities in high-income countries. In contrast, transport-sector PM2·5 emissions were higher 
in cities of middle-income countries (1621·8 tonnes/year on average) than high-income 
countries (333·1 tonnes/year). 

5 

 
The population percentage within a 500m walk to a healthy food market varied 

from 6% (Phoenix) to 70% (Bern). European cities had the highest estimates (53% on 
average), while all three US cities were in the lowest quartile, each below 20%. The three 
Australian cities, along with Maiduguri, Bangkok, and Chennai, also exhibited low access 
(less than a quarter of the population with such access). On average, access to convenience 
stores within 500m (40%) was slightly higher than for healthy food markets (36%). This 
was particularly the case for cities with low access to healthy food. For example, 21% of the 
Phoenix population had a convenience store within 500m, more than three times greater 
than for healthy food. An exception to this pattern was Chennai, with an estimate of 16% 
for convenience stores, compared with 20% for healthy food. It is likely that not all existing 
healthy food market locations were available through OSM, particularly in cities like 
Bangkok, Chennai, Hanoi, and Maiduguri where informal stalls may be important sources 
of healthy food. 

Access to any public transport stop (e.g., bus, ferry, train, tram) within 500m was 

achieved for more than 60% of the population in most cities, with three cities in middle-
income countries as exceptions: Maiduguri (10%), Mexico City (36%) and Chennai (39%). 
However, in these cities the local transport context must be considered, as informal 
collective transport options play an important role but lack spatial data to track them. 
Nevertheless, the disparity between estimated access to formal public transport 
infrastructure in middle- and high-income countries was notable and may be a factor in the 
observed trend of approximately five-fold higher PM2·5 emissions in middle-income versus 
high-income countries’ cities, notwithstanding considerable between-city variation for both 
groups (Table 1).  

Accounting for public transport service frequency for cities where such data were 

available substantially reduced estimates of accessibility. The average population percentage 
with access to any stops with service every 30 minutes was 70% (standard deviation [s.d.] 
27%). For service every 20 minutes the average city estimate fell to 45% (s.d. 23%). For 
example, 87% of Melbourne’s population had access to any public transport, but only 67% 
to stops with weekday service every 30 minutes and only 49% with service every 20 
minutes—below the average for high-income countries’ cities (55% [s.d. 15%]). In other 
cities there were modest reductions in population access when adjusting for service 
frequency, indicating broad consistency in proximity and service frequency. For example, 
São Paulo, Bern, and Lisbon had greater than 90% population access to public transport 
with average weekday service frequency of 20 minutes or less. 

For most cities, the average population percentage with access to public open space 

within 500m walking distance was relatively high at 76% (s.d. 22%). Some policy settings 
mandate universal access and any estimates below 100% suggest equity gaps that need 
addressing. Some cities had low estimates (e.g., Maiduguri and Bangkok), although this may 
reflect limitations of measuring public open space in different cities using OSM data. Once 
access was restricted to public open spaces larger than 1.5 hectares, population access 
dropped by approximately 10 percentage points on average, to 66% (s.d. 26%). However, in 
the European cities of Bern, Vic, and Odense, 70% or more of the population had access 
within 500m to such larger public open space. Substantial inequities in access to public 
open space within 500m were apparent between cities in middle- and high-income 
countries: only 42% of the population in the former’s cities had access, compared with 75% 
in the latter’s cities.

3.2. Percentage of population meeting thresholds for urban design and 
transport features to support active lifestyles 

Cerin et al.22 identified thresholds to support active lifestyles and achieve WHO physical 
activity targets. On average, less than half of the population (49%) in high-income 
countries’ cities lived in neighbourhoods reaching the population density thresholds for 
80% probability of walking for transport or meeting WHO’s target for reducing 
insufficient physical activity through walking (38%), compared with 98% of middle-income 
countries’ cities. Cities with the highest estimated population percentages living in 
neighbourhoods with population densities that support higher transport walking (see Table 
2) were in Africa (Maiduguri), Asia (Bangkok, Chennai, Hanoi, Hong Kong) and Latin 
America (Mexico City, São Paulo). These all exceeded 90% of the population for both 
scenarios A and B, as did the Iberian cities of Lisbon, Barcelona, and Valencia. The 
European cities of Belfast and Graz and the Australian city of Sydney exceeded 50% for at 
least one of the two scenarios. However, the European cities of Ghent, Odense, and 
Olomouc and the Australian city of Adelaide had notably low population density estimates 
that met neither population threshold. In North American (Baltimore, Phoenix, Seattle) 
and other Australasian cities (Auckland, Melbourne) along with Cologne and Vic in 
Europe, less than 50% of the population met density thresholds. For Scenario B, on average 
97% (s.d. 3%) of the population of cities in middle-income countries lived in 
neighbourhoods supporting densities meeting or exceeding the lower threshold for reaching 
WHO’s target of a ≥15% relative reduction in insufficient physical activity through 
combined transport and recreational walking, compared with 38% (s.d. 35%) for high-
income countries’ cities, across which population density was more variable. 

Estimates of the percentage of population living in neighbourhoods with 

intersection density meeting thresholds to support higher physical activity displayed a 
distinct pattern for many cities when compared with the marginal population density 
characteristics summarised above. There were not clear differences in intersection density 
estimates by country income classification, as observed with population density, with broad 
variation between cities regardless of country income grouping. Cities with high population 
estimates (>70% for both scenarios) of meeting or exceeding thresholds for population 
density and intersection density included Mexico City, São Paulo, Hong Kong, Chennai, 
Lisbon, Barcelona, and Valencia. Cities with moderate estimates for neighbourhood 
population density (>40%) but high for intersection density (>70%) included European 
cities of Bern, Belfast, and Graz. Cities with lower population density estimates, but 
moderate to high population exposure (>50%) to intersection density, included North 
American cities of Baltimore and Phoenix, but also European cities of Ghent, Olomouc, 
Odense, Cologne, and Vic. Seattle had lower population percentage exposure estimates for 
both population density and intersection density than the other two US cities in this study. 
Maiduguri, Bangkok, and Hanoi each had high neighbourhood population density 
exposures but moderate to low intersection density exposure. In Australasia, Sydney had 
moderate neighbourhood population density exposure but lower exposure for intersection 
density, while Auckland and Melbourne had lower population densities and lower 
intersection density population exposure estimates, and Adelaide had both low population 
density and intersection density (<40%).

3.3. Spatial distribution of walkable neighbourhoods and access to public 
open space 

Neighbourhood-level results show spatial patterning and inequities within cities. Figure 1 
presents the spatial distribution of urban walkability for the 25 cities. Access to large public 
open space within 500m (see Figure 2) offers a different conceptualisation of spaces that 
provide opportunities for physical activity—in addition to health benefits from nature, 
social connectedness, and heat-island mitigation—and demonstrates different spatial 
patterns than walkability. Achieving policy goals of access to both walkable neighbourhoods 
with local destinations and public open space requires evidence-driven city planning to 
reach a balance and prevent unintended negative consequences for the health and wellbeing 
of residents.34-37 

Additional maps and visualisations of the population percentages meeting 

thresholds to support active and sustainable lifestyles for each city are included in the 
appendix. To summarise, while we identified walkable neighbourhoods across all cities, 
Australasian and US cities in particular exhibited sprawl outside their cores. Most of the 
cities in middle-income countries and the US were poorly served by public open space 
compared with the European and Australasian cities. The spatial distribution data from the 
project have been made publicly available and provide an opportunity for researchers to 
conduct their own analyses, which may be supplemented by using city-specific covariate 
data (e.g., sociodemographic characteristics, air pollutant distributions) which may not be 
publicly available globally. 

4. An indicator framework for better city planning 

This study developed an open-source urban indicator computational framework using 
open-data sources supporting international comparative analyses. It demonstrated 
applications of this framework by calculating spatial indicators of built environment 
features for 25 diverse cities. These data and this analytical workflow enabled comparisons 
of within- and between-city performance on the indicators. In general, the data were 
available and useful in all but the lowest-income cities, so broadening participation in 
crowdsourced data is essential to worldwide efforts to monitor urban indicators. 

Many people do not have access to the urban design and transport features needed 

for healthy and sustainable cities. Our results show that older compact cities had better 
walkability, irrespective of economic development status. The worst-performing cities for 
walkability were in high-income countries including the US, Australia, and New Zealand. 
These cities developed primarily in the 20th century under a car-centric planning model.38 
Lowe et al. similarly found that Australian and US cities were the most likely to have 
contemporary urban design and transport policies that favour car use over active 
transport.21 However, investment in public transport has made it a viable alternative to the 
car in some Australasian cities,4 while US cities have fallen behind by global standards. In 
less-resourced cities, the economic necessity of providing mobility may take precedence over 
intersectoral planning that protects and promotes healthy lifestyles. While walking for 
transport is important, access to public open space is also critical for health and wellbeing,39 
particularly with a changing climate. Four of the five worst-performing cities for access to 
public open space were in middle-income countries, joined by the car-dominated city of 
Phoenix in the US. Inadequate policy frameworks and gaps between policy and 

11 

 
implementation likely contributed to unequal access to health-supporting urban design and 
transport features.21 Access inequities revealed by these spatial analyses point to areas 
requiring policy interventions to reduce health inequities between and within cities. 
Creating high-quality, fine-grained spatial indicators that incorporate evidence-based 
targets facilitates comparison not just between cities, but within cities. This evidence in 
turn provides a foundation for planning future interventions, monitoring policy impact, 
and harnessing lessons from comparable countries. 

For example, São Paulo and Bangkok have similar populations and large 

proportions of residents in informal settlements. Yet more than 95% of São Paulo’s 
residents were estimated to have access to frequent public transport, compared with 62% of 
Bangkok’s. More generally, and across all indicators reported, São Paulo outperformed 
Bangkok. These divergences are best understood by looking not just at the between-city 
results, but the within-city results. Figure 1 shows, for São Paulo, that relative urban 
walkability was high across the majority of the urban area, whereas Bangkok achieved high 
walkability in the central city only. In São Paulo, the areas where walkability was lower 
followed the paths of the two major rivers that pass through the city, adjoined by highways 
and industrially zoned land. In Bangkok, outside the central city, walkability was achieved 
only in the areas near the highways that radiate outwards like spokes from the central hub. 
Between these spokes were the areas with the least walkable access to local amenities. 
Consistent with our findings, Lowe et al. found that Bangkok had the greatest policy gaps 
and limitations, while São Paulo’s policy framework performed better than those of many 
cities in high-income countries.21 The critical links between transport, land use, and health 
equity need to be recognised in future iterations and implementations of Bangkok’s city 
plans, developed under the holistic approach advocated for by Peraphan and Sittha.40 This 
applies similarly in other countries—including low-density, car-centric cities in high-
income countries such as the US and Australia. 

4.1. Call for action 

This study demonstrated the feasibility of producing comparative spatial indicators to 
benchmark cities on urban design and transport features important for public health and 
sustainability. The workflow for creating the indicators has inherent value but is most 
useful if the urban policy and research community uses the open-source framework to 
continue monitoring cities’ progress towards health and sustainability goals with periodic 
indicator scorecards. Regional, national, and global agencies can play important roles in 
incentivising such work, particularly when data collection is required to fill open-data gaps. 
Our open data and open-source methods allow anyone to freely replicate this study. The 
open-source philosophy posits that communities of research and practice should 
collectively build and share tools rather than develop individual ad hoc scripts that produce 
incomparable indicators. A potential benefit of using the methods presented here would be 
that consistent measures could be created and compared at different points in time with 
few barriers to participation. 

Open data and open-source tools together create an opportunity that, for the first 
time, enables built environment, health, and policy researchers to quantify and monitor the 
progress of their city and compare local results across cities globally—if the data and tools 
are of sufficient quality. Data availability and quality vary both between and within cities, 
and this is a particular concern when using open data.41,42 We therefore developed methods  

12 

 
Box 2: Global call for action 

We urge the UN and WHO to: 

• 

• 

incentivise and promote open data and open-source tools in the pursuit of 
meeting health, sustainability, and equity goals 
support expansion of our indicators into a global observatory of within- and 
between-city indicators 

•  provide practical guidance on identifying barriers to walking and wheelchair 

access 

We urge local, regional, and national governments to: 

•  use the open-source framework we presented to create consistent measures that 
can inform policy and monitor cities’ progress towards health and sustainability 
goals, using indicator scorecards to provide regular feedback and prompt targeted 
interventions 
involve local populations in crowdsourcing data about their own communities 

• 
•  provide resources to fill gaps of missing data 
•  map barriers to walking access to refine indicators 
•  work together with academics and share best practices 
•  use open commons and emerging standard open platforms like OSM to collect 

and contribute data 

We urge scientific societies to: 

•  host city indicators for continual monitoring and comparison 
•  provide critical resources, expertise, and tools to ensure longevity of the hosting 

• 

platform 
train students and involve local populations as citizen scientists to collect 
crowdsourced data about their own communities 

to identify and overcome data limitations through extensive consultation and validation 
with local collaborators throughout the process.23 Data and tools will improve if researchers 
and practitioners contribute to common methods. We recommend that all cities 
participate in the open commons, using emerging standard open platforms like OSM to 
collect and contribute data, and adopt existing standard open-data platforms with easy 
access and consistent digitisation standards for local data collection. If the goal is the public 
good, then open-source should be the default for government data and analytics. But 
governments need not be solely responsible. Open data can be created through three 
mechanisms: government investment, commercial investment, and crowdsourcing. We 
encourage collaborations between academia and industry, alongside multilateral efforts to 
set standards and foster participation in the development and application of indicators. It is 
imperative that we actively encourage community engagement through crowdsourcing, and 
that these indicators are used for planning and advocacy to achieve health and sustainability 
goals while reducing inequities.2 

In this article, we described a tool created by an international team and presented 

results for 25 international cities. But we also described a process that starts and finishes 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
with local knowledge: gather data locally; calculate, analyse, and compare indicators 
globally; and then interpret the results locally using local context and knowledge to derive 
insights, plan interventions, and advocate for reform. As an international team with local 
collaborators, we identified study areas, developed tools, collected data, ran analyses, and 
validated results. This collaborative approach lowered the barriers—technical constraints, 
resource limitations, and costs—to conducting this kind of analysis. Better city planning 
around the world requires better monitoring by local governments, with an emphasis on 
local participation, local data, and local use. We have developed this framework, 
demonstrated its utility, and provided open-source tools to stimulate adoption and creation 
of common indicators that can be benchmarked and monitored to support healthy and 
sustainable cities. 

To create an international system for monitoring spatial indicators of health, 

sustainability, and equity, cities should promote the crowdsourcing of data using the 
current indicators and thresholds as a foundation for global comparisons. They should 
provide technical assistance in data collection, analysis, and application. A growing number 
of data observatories focus on urban SDG indicators, but they tend to ignore spatial and 
population distributions that enable evidence-based planning for targeted local 
interventions. As our results demonstrate, beyond just a city-level focus, these indicators 
require a within-city focus to unpack heterogeneity. Maps allow such variations and 
inequities to be easily seen and understood. Organisations like the UN and WHO are well 
positioned to support the expansion of this work into a global observatory of within- and 
between-city indicators to promote better city planning that can be used by local decision-
makers to benchmark and monitor progress.

A1.1. Spatial data collection 

Collaborators from 19 countries (Table A) in the International Physical Activity and Environment Network (IPEN, 
https://www.ipenproject.org/) and other collaborators expressed interest in the Global Healthy and Sustainable City-
Indicators Collaboration. They nominated local representatives with spatial expertise to complete a Google Forms 
survey (Table B) detailing available resources for representing their region in the study. 

Seventeen cities had available street network data, with datasets publicly available in 15 cities. However, only six 
cities had publicly available data on urban design and transport features of interest, with commercially licensed data 
being more commonplace. Some datasets were provided by local collaborators during the survey, but they were 
inconsistent in terms of availability, formats, comparability, and coverage. Thus, for consistency we decided to use 
open data with global coverage in the first instance.  

This ‘open data first’ approach meant that we were able to expand our analysis to include the full set of indicators 
for all 25 cities. For sources of open data for each studied city, see Appendix A2·1. The limitations of open data 
were identified through consultation with collaborators throughout the indicator estimation workflow, and we 
developed methods to mitigate these limitations where required by incorporating custom data and methods to 
improve the validity of our analysis. Details on the data validation process were published in the software 
framework method paper.1  

Due to the lack of detailed information on street networks and walkability barriers, we recognise two important 
assumptions when measuring the considered walkable distances: 1) streets do not present barriers to walking or 
wheelchair access; and 2) people’s walking ranges are higher.

5A1.2. Defining study regions  
The analysis area for each city included in our study was conceptually framed as the urban portion of a city’s broad 
administrative boundaries. Administrative boundaries were either supplied by collaborators via the preliminary 
spatial data survey or acquired by the researchers independently. The urban study region was defined as the 
intersection of this boundary with that of corresponding urban centres identified by the Global Human Settlements 
project (UCDB R2019A v1·2).2 The use of this global data source for urban centres helps to ensure that the analysis 
focuses on exposure for urban populations across all cities, but not for lower-density rural settings on the urban 
fringe, which may otherwise fall within an administrative boundary.  

A1.3. Processing administrative boundaries 
A curated dataset of study region administrative boundaries was manually prepared. Administrative boundaries 
provided by collaborators for their city were used in the first instance, with alternative open-data sources for 
boundaries identified for the remaining cities. Boundaries for some cities were revised through consultation with 
collaborators following review of the preliminary data validation reports generated in the pre-processing phase. The 
final city-specific boundary methods are detailed below. 

A1.3.1 General methods 
Where city boundaries were acquired as a single valid feature, these were output in the relevant projected CRS for 
that region to a geopackage file. City boundaries supplied as a series of administrative polygons (e.g. Belfast) were 
dissolved using QGIS 3·8·1-Zanzibar.3 Any gaps that incorrectly remained were removed using the  
“delete holes” tool, and saved to the geopackage file. For cities where boundaries were either not supplied (e.g., 
Auckland) or not supplied in a usable format (Hanoi, as lines and points—not areas) alternative boundaries were 
sourced. For cities with geometry type of PolygonZ (Ghent, Odense), these were exported as a regular polygon 
geometry, discarding Z-dimension data, which may cause difficulties with subsequent processing of multipolygons.   

A1.3.2 City-specific methods 

GHS urban boundaries: Baltimore, Seattle (United States); Maiduguri (Nigeria) 
It was decided that for these cities the best solution for study region boundaries was to use the urban region as 
defined in the Global Human Settlements dataset (UCDB R2019A v1·2). It was decided not to do this for all 
regions, as a number of collaborators indicated that the predicted urban centre as defined in the GHS dataset did not 
reliably include urban-fringe growth areas, which were considered important (e.g. Australian cities, Mexico City). 
As such, where boundaries were approved by collaborators, these existing ones were used. Elsewhere, on approval 
from collaborators, the GHS urban centre was used. 

Auckland, New Zealand 
New Zealand administrative boundaries (statsnzmeshblock-higher-geographies-2019-generalised-SHP.zip) were 
retrieved from the Stats NZ geographic data portal (https://datafinder.stats.govt.nz/data/category/annual-
boundaries/2019/). The Auckland city boundary was processed by selecting the Mesh Blocks with UR_2019_V_1 
value of ‘Auckland’ and with IUR2019__1 classed as major urban. The boundaries were dissolved and saved to the 
boundaries geopackage. 

Barcelona, Spain 
The initial identified boundary was revised using a collaborator-supplied shape file following preliminary data 
validation. Boundaries were dissolved and exported following the general method. 

Bern, Switzerland 
A boundary zip file was retrieved from the Geoportal of the Canton of Bern 
(https://www.geo.apps.be.ch/index.php?option=com_easysdi_shop&task=download.direct&id=195). Using the 
shapefile “GENGRZ5_GEN2G5”, the feature of the name “Bern” was exported as Bern to the boundaries 
geopackage. 

6Chennai, India 
An administrative boundary for Chennai from OpenStreetMap was retrieved in geojson format 
(https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search.php?q=Chennai+India&polygon_geojson=1&format=geojson). The 
QGIS delete holes processing tool was used to include a gap identified as representing the St Thomas Mount 
cantonment (http://www.cbstm.org.in:9080/Cantonment/web/Home.html) in the Chennai urban study region. The 
derived Chennai boundary was then exported to the boundaries geopackage. 

Cologne, Germany 
The boundary was retrieved from the Köln (Cologne) open-data portal (https://offenedaten-
koeln.de/dataset/stadtteile). The ‘Fix geometries’’ tool was run, then the Dissolve algorithm, the ‘‘Delete holes’’ 
algorithm, and finally was exported as Cologne to the boundaries geopackage. 

Ghent, Belgium 
A boundary for the city of Ghent omitting the North Sea port industrial area was supplied by collaborators, 
following the advice received in the preliminary data survey that this portion of the city should be excluded from 
consideration as ‘urban’. Boundaries were dissolved and exported following the general method. 

Graz, Austria 
Boundaries were retrieved from the Austrian government open-data portal 
(https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/land-stmk_bezirksgrenzen/resource/086b453d-c474-4458-ba31-
2b5408f5b999). The field BEZNAM with value ‘Graz Stadt’ was exported as Graz to the boundaries geopackage. 

Hanoi, Vietnam 
Administrative boundaries for Vietnam (vnm_admbnda_2018_shp.zip) were retrieved from Humanitarian Data 
Exchange (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/viet-nam-administrative-boundaries-polygon-polylinev), and the level 1 
boundary layer (vnm_admbnda_adm1_2018_v2) feature corresponding to ADM1_EN value of ‘Ha Noi’ was saved 
to the boundaries geopackage. 

Hong Kong SAR, China  
A boundary was retrieved from ESRI China (http://opendata.esrichina.hk/datasets/hong-kong-18-districts/data). The 
‘fix geometries’ algorithm was used to resolve validity issues, boundaries were dissolved, and ‘delete holes’ was run 
prior to saving to the curated geopackage. 

Mexico City, Mexico 
Administrative boundary data for Mexico City were retrieved from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/mexican-
administrative-level-0-country-1-estado-and-2-municipio-boundary-polygons. Following advice from collaborators, 
the Mexico City boundary was constructed to reflect Greater Mexico City, in the sense of Zona Metropolitana del 
Valle de México 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Mexico_City#Metropolitan_Area_of_the_Valley_of_Mexico). This involved 
the combination of: 16 municipalities (alcaldías) of Ciudad de México (Azcapotzalco, Álvaro Obregón, Benito 
Juárez, Coyoacán, Cuajimalpa de Morelos, Cuauhtémoc, Gustavo A. Madero, Iztacalco, Iztapalapa, Magdalena 
Contreras, Miguel Hidalgo, Milpa Alta, Tláhuac, Tlalpan, Venustiano Carranza, Xochimilco); the 40 municipalities 
of the State of Mexico (Acolman, Atenco, Atizapán de Zaragoza, Chalco, Chiautla, Chicoloapan, Chiconcuac, 
Chimalhuacán, Coacalco de Berriozábal, Cocotitlán, Coyotepec, Cuautitlán, Cuautitlán Izcalli, Ecatepec de Morelos, 
Huehuetoca, Huixquilucan, Ixtapaluca, Jaltenco, La Paz, Melchor Ocampo, Naucalpan de Juárez, Nextlalplan, 
Nezahualcoyotl, Nicolás Romero, Papalotla, San Martín de las Pirámides, Tecámac, Temamatla, Teoloyucán, 
Teotihuacán, Tepetlaoxtoc, Tepotzotlán, Texcoco, Tezoyuca, Tlamanalco, Tlalnepantla de Baz, Tultepec, Tultitlán, 
Valle de Chalco Solidaridad, Zumpango); one conurbation municipality of the State of Hidalgo (Tizayuca); and 
additional municipalities (Amecameca, Apaxco, Atlautla, Axapusco, Ayapango, Ecatzingo, Hueypoxtla, Isidro 
Fabela, Jilotzingo, Juchitepec, Nopaltepec, Otumba, Ozumba, Temascalapa, Tenango del Aire, Tepetlixpa, 
Tequixquiac, Villa del Carbón), and Tonanitla. 

Noting that some of the ADM2_ES names in the source data were not unique within the country of Mexico, the 
ADM1_ES state names were limited to ‘‘Distrito Federal’’, ‘‘Hidalgo’’ and ‘‘Mexico’’. The required zones were 

7 
identified using the query, which involved manually amending names to match their recorded representation in the 
source data (i.e. some missing characters, truncation, and switched characters). Matched provinces were verified to 
be in their correct location using a subsequent audit.

The final query returned 76 municipalities correctly representing the de facto extent of Greater Mexico City. The 
retrieved polygons’ boundaries were dissolved, reprojected to EPSG 32614 (UTM14N), and saved to the 
boundaries.gpkg file as the layer ‘Mexico City’. 

Phoenix, United States 
A boundary shapefile was retrieved from a US open-data portal (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-
2015-state-arizona-current-place-state-based), and the feature with the name of ‘Phoenix City’ was exported as 
Phoenix to boundaries geopackage. 

São Paulo, Brazil 
Administrative boundaries for Brazil were retrieved from Humanitarian Data Exchange 
(https://data.humdata.org/dataset/brazil-administrative-level-0-boundaries), and the feature with ‘name_2’ value of 
‘Sao Paolo’ was saved to the boundaries geopackage.

A2. Reproducible analytic workflow for estimating indicators  

Following the preliminaries stage, we developed a generalised workflow for calculating within- and between-city 
indicator estimates. The following supplementary materials elaborate on how our open-source framework was 
applied to the analysis of the 25 cities presented in this study. This material is intended to provide guidance for 
researchers and practitioners seeking to reproduce our results or extend them for different study regions and time 
points.  

Figure A below illustrates the general workflow of the framework, which comprises a four-step process from data 
acquisition to indicator aggregation. Researchers and practitioners seeking to reproduce the indicator results for their 
cities are advised to look at the open-source framework repository at https://github.com/global-healthy-liveable-
cities/global-indicators.git, and then consult the following details for calculating indicators.

A2.1. Data acquisition  
Other than the study region boundaries described in the preliminaries, most data were sourced from open datasets 
with global scope. These global open-data sources are summarised in Table C. The other exceptions were a set of 
custom destinations developed by collaborators for Maiduguri, and public transport schedule datasets in General 
Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format developed by specific agencies, many of which were hosted on 
OpenMobilityData. Data sources of GTFS feeds available for the studied cities are summarised in Table D.

Additional region-specific 
parameter notes

Notes on parameters accounting for study region exceptions to generic processing workflow 

1. Custom destinations: Custom destination data to use, in addition to those identified using OSM. Use a comma-separated list specifying file name (located in 
study region folder, once generated), category plain name field, category full name field, Y coordinate, X coordinate, EPSG number.  Specifically for Maiduguri:  
Maiduguri_shops_convenience_complete_2020-07-13_categorised_final.csv,dest_name,dest_name_full,Latitude,Longitude,4326 

2. No buffered study region: Instead of using buffered study region, use regular study region for excerpting network from OSM. This may allow for looping over 
true islands to extract individual networks (e.g. Hong Kong), which may not be possible with the buffered region (which results in only retaining larger network 
segment).  For Hong Kong, this is set to ‘TRUE’, for other cities it has been left blank. 

3. Network polygon iteration: Iterate over polygons for network retrieval, and then combine.  This is useful for cities spanning multiple islands, in conjunction 
with the ‘No buffered study region’ parameter. For Hong Kong, this is set to ‘TRUE’, for other cities it has been left blank. 

4. Network connection threshold: Minimum threshold distance in units as per project parameters for disconnected networks (e.g. road networks for cities spanning 
multiple islands) to be included in the combined network for a city. For Hong Kong, this is set to 200, a value determined through manual inspection of the 
geographic context; for other cities, it has been left blank. 

5. Not GHS urban intersection: For cities where intersection with the GHS urban area is not valid.  For Vic which does not have a corresponding urban area in the 
GHS dataset), this variable was set to ‘TRUE’, indicating that the provided boundary is to be used.

 A2.2. Setup configuration 
Project and study region configuration parameters were defined using configuration files and were used to facilitate 
our software framework’s semi-automated workflow to calculate spatial indicators of the 25 study regions. Tables E 
and F summarise project parameters and study region–specific parameters used during pre-processing. Other 
parameters used for sampling estimate processing and indicator calculation were compiled into a series of 
configuration files within the project’s Github repository, which can be constructed with a single command 
(https://github.com/global-healthy-liveable-cities/global-
indicators/blob/7852424e4852c99b5b0f7b65982d289db28e2ed0/process/setup_config.py). Researchers can draw 
upon them as templates and adapt for a new project as required. 

A2.3. Pre-processing input data 

Data for each study region was pre-processed with a series of Python scripts, drawing upon the configuration 
parameters in Tables E and F for analyses, with output to city-specific PostgreSQL (PostGIS) databases, before final 
output in geopackage format as used in the main analyses. Generalised data pre-processing for urban boundaries, 
pedestrian street network, population, spatial features, and sample points has been described in our methods paper.1 
Specific details on deriving points of interest, regularly serviced public transport locations, and public open space 
access points are provided below. 

A2.3.1 Points of interest 
Destination categories were coded using a conceptual mapping of key-value pair terms (Table G) from 
OpenStreetMap point, line, and polygon features, which were identified by reviewing coding guidelines (general, 
and community/country specific) and following a preliminary dataset validation survey of local collaborators, as 
shown in Table B). This approach helped us to ensure that the definition of built environment features and points of 
interest was consistent across study regions and matched the understandings of local experts. Where OpenStreetMap 
representation was considered inadequate based on the validation findings, we asked local collaborators to nominate 
usage of custom data for the study regions. In our study, this was only required for Maiduguri, Nigeria, because we 
found that, among the 25 study regions, Maiduguri is the only notable outlier regarding the representation of daily 
living amenities on OpenStreetMap (Table H). The custom destination data for Maiduguri were collected directly 
from the field by trained field assistants using handheld GPS, and the locations recorded in Microsoft Excel.

1 Population estimate was derived from the Global Human Settlement 2015 modelled population layer. The value corresponded to the population estimate 
within the identified urban portion of the city, identified using the Global Human Settlement dataset (with exception of Maiduguri and Vic). This was used as 
a common reference point for population data for all cities, as it was available at both a recent time point and high resolution (approximately 250sqm grid). 
The population data was used spatially in the project to indicate relative population density. Values in absolute terms may differ from other estimates, 
including those officially available, or more recent for the greater city areas which extend beyond urban centres. 
2 It was found that Maiduguri had relatively lower OSM destination counts than other cities of comparable urban size and population in the study. This 
observation led to the development of methods to include custom destinations, and an independent data-collection effort for Maiduguri. 
3 Vic appeared to be well represented with OSM destinations for its size and population. However, unlike all other cities it did not intersect a 2015 ‘urban 
area’ identified by the Global Human Settlements dataset. In this regard, it should be noted that Vic is exceptional compared with other cities, whose urban 
study regions were defined using, or in conjunction with, the GHS urban layer; Vic’s study region used in the above is its own administrative boundary 
(supplied by collaborators). 

A2.3.2 Public transport stops with regular daytime weekday service 
The usual daytime weekday frequency of public transport service is a marker of its utility, beyond proximity: if a 
bus stop is close, but rarely served, its usefulness is more limited than a regularly served stop. There are many 
factors that could be considered as markers of utility for public transport which were beyond the scope of our 
study—for example, the cost or time taken to reach a particular destination. For this study, we sought to estimate the 
percentage of population with access to a public transport stop served frequently enough that an average wait during 
weekday daytime hours (7am to 7pm) would be approximately 10 minutes; that is, a headway of 20 minutes, with 
average wait time conceptualised as half of the headway between departures.4  

Public transport schedule data were obtained from transport agencies in General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) 
format. GTFS (https://gtfs.org/, https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) provides a format that has been 
broadly adopted by public transport agencies around the world for publishing and disseminating regularly updated 
transport schedules since 2005 (https://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-2/pioneering-open-data-standards-the-

16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gtfs-story/). It is an established standard for representing public transportation schedules used for urban transport 
research in diverse contexts.5-7 The GTFS dataset is a zipped folder comprising a series of text files that contain 
comma-delimited data for routes, stop times, dates of service, and agency metadata, which can be merged to provide 
granular detail of a transport agency’s services at each of its stop locations for a particular period.  

We identified cities with available GTFS data targeting 2019 for public transport stop location headway analysis. 
We developed a headway analysis method broadly following Arundel et al.,8 except that we used headway instead of 
median inter-arrival time. Methodological details of the analysis are presented as open-source code available at the 
repository. For fair comparisons, we sought to include cities in the analysis with complete GTFS coverage for the 
buffered study regions, and with feeds schedules for a time in Spring 2019 when most schools were not on holidays 
(5 April to 5 June for Northern Hemisphere cities; 8 October to 5 December for those in the Southern Hemisphere). 
Not all schedules neatly met this criterion. Specifically, we approximated coverage for Chennai using a feed dated to 
2010 to capture rail service representation in particular; this compromise was preferable to exclusion, but we 
recognised it as an important caveat on presenting the results of this city.  

Public transport stop locations were analysed to identify those with normal weekday operation time from 7am to 
7pm during the time period of interest for that city. The analysis time period was specified for each study region in 
Table D. Average headways were calculated for each stop location based on the number of daily departures during 
the analysis time period. Subsequently, three sets of public transport locations were exported to support the 
accessibility analysis of sample points: 1) any public transport stops (combining GTFS and OSM data); 2) stops 
with a headway of 20 minutes; and 3) stops with a headway of 30 minutes (for use as a sensitivity analysis for the 
effect of threshold choice). The modes of public transport in the GTFS specification include tram, metro, rail, bus, 
ferry, cable tram, aerial lift, funicular, trolleybus, and monorail. Due to some inconsistencies in the GTFS 
specification by different transport agencies, some cities required custom parameterisation to match the specific 
implementation used by their transport agencies. For example, Bern and Sydney each required custom specification 
of route numbers in the configuration of feeds for these cities, to accurately represent their transport modes. 
A summary of the transport stop headway analysis is shown in Table I.

A2.3.3 Public open space 
Parks, nature reserves, plazas, and squares could all be considered areas of public open space: open areas where 
people may gather for leisure. The identification of public open space using OpenStreetMap is a distinct challenge to 
other kinds of destinations, which are usually localised as discrete ‘points’. Public open spaces are areas, not points, 
and so more complex topological relationships must be considered in addition to mapping of classification tags. In 
terms of representation on OpenStreetMap, open spaces may be located next to each other; in effect, a jointly larger 
area than contiguous polygonal boundaries taken individually would suggest. They may also be nested within larger 
areas of open space, which may or may not be publicly accessible.  

A series of logical queries were used to first identify areas of open space; meeting any one of these was grounds for 
consideration as a potential public open space. These are summarised in Table J. 

A layer of areas that were categorically not to be considered as public open space was created, and any portions of 
potential areas of open space that overlap areas marked for exclusion were also excluded. For example, if there was 
an area coded to suggest it could be a natural area that might potentially be an open space (e.g. 
‘boundary=nature_reserve’), but was located entirely within an area with a military or industrial land use, or was 
otherwise tagged to indicate that access was not public (e.g. for employees or staff only, private, or otherwise 
inaccessible), this was not considered an area of public open space and was excluded. In addition, areas of public 
open space that were not larger than a minimum size threshold (10 m2) were excluded to ensure incidental slivers of 
public land like small nature strips did not contribute spuriously to estimates of access to public open space. 

Once areas of public open space had been identified, proxy locations for possible entry points were created at 
regular intervals (every 20 metres) on the sections of the boundaries of those areas of public open space which are 
within 30 metres of the road network.9 These pseudo-entry points can be used to evaluate distance to the nearest 
public open space, regardless of the fact that our data cannot be used to infer where the true entry locations are (and 
in many cases, there may be no formal entry points). Sets of pseudo-entry points were respectively exported for 
areas of public open space of any size, and those with a public area of greater than 1.5 hectares. The final sets of 
access points were used in origin–destination network analyses evaluating network distance to near public open 
space.
