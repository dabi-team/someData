Abstract 

The increasing demand for renewable energy and shortage of resources in today's world 
has been stimulating researchers to explore means for the extraction of energy from wasted heat 
sources. Thermoelectric materials can convert thermal energy directly into electric energy and vice 
versa. In this paper, a phonon crystal structure has been proposed and characterized to study its 
bandgap magnitude and the effect on the thermal conductivity which could increase the efficiency 
of the thermoelectric materials. The novelty of this paper is the phonon crystal structure that has 
been  proposed  and  the  method  to  study  the  effects  of  different  dimensional  parameters  of  the 
phonon crystal structure on the bandgap magnitude. The phonon crystal’s bandgap is simulated by 
the  COMSOL  software  and  then  validated  with  other  literature  results.  Based  on  the  validated 
simulation  model,  a  regression  parameter  model  is  developed  from  the  COMSOL  software 
simulation.  The  model  is  used  to  predict  the  magnitude  of  the  bandgap  of  the  phonon  crystal 
structure from input design parameters where the sensitivity of the design parameters and their 
interactions  can  be  analyzed.  The  design  parameters  can  be  optimized  for  the  biggest  bandgap 
magnitude based on the regression parameter model. The optimization results show a significant 
improvement in the magnitude of the bandgap. 

I.Introduction 

Increasing  energy  efficiency  is  demanded  as  energy  consumption  increases  in  various 

applications such as transportation, businesses, and industries. The use of non-renewable energy 

resources  has  been  increased  to  meet  energy  demands  but  at  a  cost  of  increased  greenhouse 

emissions  and  environmental  pollution  which  lead  to  global  warming.  Much  interest  has  been 

shown  in  utilizing  waste  heat  recovery  methods  to  increase  the  thermal  efficiency  to  meet  the 

miscellaneous energy demands rather than the use of additional non-renewable energy resources. 

[1]  Thermoelectric materials, as a potential candidate for the direct interconversion of thermal and 

electrical  energy,  have  attracted  considerable  attention  in  the  field  of  energy  harvesting  and 

thermal management applications. The electricity generation from waste heat via thermoelectric

devices  can  be  considered  a  new  energy  source.  For  instance,  automotive  exhaust  gas  and  all 

industrial processes generate an enormous amount of waste heat that can be converted to electricity 

by using thermoelectric devices. [2] 

The efficiency of thermoelectric materials can be well quantified by the dimensionless figure 

of merit, ZT as shown in Eq. (1).

where 

 is the electrical conductivity, S is the Seebeck coefficient, T is the temperature and 

 is the thermal conductivity. The high figure of merit is hindered by the high thermal conductivity 

𝜎𝜎

of  the  material.  [3]  The  increase  in  the  phonon  wave  activity  greatly  influences  the  thermal 
𝜅𝜅
conductivity, and dispersion of this wave activity improves the thermoelectric efficiency of the 

material. One effective way of lowering the thermal conductivity is to introduce holes in the lattice 

and create a phonon crystal. [4] The structure with a periodic arrangement of holes in it is called a 

phonon  crystal.  One  challenge  when  building  a  phonon  crystal  is  to  try  to  keep  the  electrical 

conductivity high at the same time. Often when phonon crystals are created both the thermal and 

electrical  conductivity  is  lowered,  which  is  not  optimal.  [5]  If  the  material  is  selected  and 

constructed correctly and the phonon wave dispersion is high, the thermal conductivity will be 

lowered much more than the electrical conductivity. This is possible as the electrical conductivity 

is likely to be lowered due to the removal of material. [6] Optimization of band gap structures or 

phonon crystals has seen an increase in interest over the last decade. [7] The topic is challenging 

owing to the wide applicability of the metamaterials featured by the band gap property. Moreover, 

new  technologies  like  3D  printing  show  new  perspectives  on  the  optimal  metamaterial  design 

based on computational analysis. [8]  

A  band  gap  means  that  phonons  of  certain  frequencies  cannot  propagate  through  the 

medium.[9] Gaps may appear in the wave frequency band structure for periodic materials implying 

that waves cannot propagate in certain frequency ranges. If the conditions for wave interference 

are satisfied, periodic structures that possess phononic bandgaps can block or reflect heat. [10] If 

a thermal vibration (with its frequency in the thermal frequency gap) is generated within the system, 

it will be blocked irrespective of its propagation direction. [11] The medium can be modified to 

create or suppress band gaps. The modification can be done by introducing defects like holes in 

the lattice. [12]

In this paper, a novel phonon crystal structure has been proposed and characterized to study 

its  bandgap  magnitude  response  to  different  geometrical  and  dimensional  parameter  changes. 

Three geometrical and dimensional parameter inputs of the novel phonon crystal will be selected 

and  defined.  The  effect  of  each  parameter  will  be  quantified  and  compared  using  the  response 

surface method (RSM). The RSM tool is applied to optimize the input parameters for the largest 

bandgap  in  this  study.  The  sensitivity  of  the  parameters  and  their  interactions  also  has  been 

analyzed. The parameters have been optimized for the largest bandgap magnitude possible. The 

optimal combination of the parameters has been compared with and verified by the result obtained 

solely on COMSOL simulation software. The COMSOL model simulation results are compared 

with  the  results  obtained  from  an  already  published  paper  to  validate  the  COMSOL  model. 

Different geometries are  tested to  see  how they  affect the magnitude of  the bandgap. With the 

optimal geometrical and dimensional parameter combination that produces the biggest bandgap 

magnitude, the thermal conductivity of the phonon crystal can be greatly reduced, hence resulting 

in an increase in thermoelectric efficiency. 

II.Finite element analysis modelling and validation 

Eigen analysis of basic topologies of periodic structures can be used as a systematic approach 

to identify mode frequency and shapes of unit cells and their basic mode mechanisms. [13] The 

eigenmode shapes from  this analysis display all possible unit cell mode shapes derived from a 

basic unit cell while guaranteeing that the resulting cell mode shapes can be arranged in a periodic 

lattice. The crystal structure of an infinite silicon lattice was modelled based on the finite element 

analysis  simulation  model  in  the  COMSOL  Multiphysics  software  using  the  Floquet  boundary 

conditions (Floquet BC) [14]. As shown in Fig. 1, the model is a two-dimensional square structure 

where  holes  are introduced  to  study  the  band  structure.  It will  be  built  using  Solid  mechanical 

structure physics and Eigen frequency solver study. The model is built using only the unit cell for 

the  structure.  Figure  2  shows  the  resulting  unit  cell  when  modelled  in  COMSOL.  The  lattice 

constant size, the size of the holes and the cell’s thickness could be changed/modified to affect the 

magnitude of the bandgap. The lattice constant is defined as the distance “a” between two centers 

of the two adjacent circular holes. “D” is the diameter of the holes. “b” is the side length of the 

unit cell, the distances between the two edges of the two adjacent holes as shown in Figure 2.

After the model is generated, materials were chosen and applied to the model. The material of the 

solid medium chosen for the model is pure silicon and the material of the holes is air. It is assumed 

that the silicon material in the simulation is orthotropic rather than isotropic since this assumption 

reflects  the  real-life  situation  better.  [15]  The  material  properties  of  the  orthotropic  silicon  are 

shown in Table 1. The mesh size “Coarser” was chosen after the convergence test is carried out. 

A finer mesh than this is unnecessary as it does not increase the accuracy and will take a much 

longer computational time. [16]

Floquet-type boundary conditions can be applied to compute eigenfrequencies for a large 

repetitive grid using a model containing only a unit cell. Floquet boundary conditions were selected 

and applied to the model with the wave number vectors Kx and Ky along the x and y directions of 

the model as shown in Figure 3. In these boundary conditions, the wave vectors Kx and Ky are 

used to define the periodic condition within the first Brillouin Zone. The two periodic conditions 

are shown with the red lines for the x-direction and the blue lines for the y-direction. The Floquet 

boundary condition for an infinite-plate waveguide can be expressed and given by

the  selected  lowest  natural  frequencies  for  the  first  8  eigenfrequencies.  We  then  plot  the  wave 

propagation  frequencies  versus  each  value  of  “k”  between  0  to  3  with  an  increment  of  0.1  for 

different dispersion curves along different vector paths/directions. A band gap appears in the plot 

as a region in which no wave dispersion curves exist. The largest frequency band gap range is 

recorded along with its magnitude as shown in Figure 5.

III.Model validation         

The  COMSOL  simulation  model  used  in  this  study  is  validated  with  the  model  from  the 

previously published works found in the literature  [11-12,15-16] where the results as presented in

Figures 6-9. The wave vector setup in the literature’s model will be applied in our COMSOL model 

set up to calculate the phonon wave dispersion curves and the magnitude of the maximum bandgap. 

All the comparisons are based on a single unit cell square lattice structure model. The model that 

is used for our study will have the same wave number vector (kx and ky), boundary condition, and 

parametric increment of “k” as those of the literature’s model. The results are compared to verify 

the  accuracy  of  the  models.  The  model  has  also  been  validated  in  different  studies  such  as 

electromagnetic wave study and acoustic pressure wave study [17] that are used to calculate the 

eigenfrequencies  instead  of  solid  mechanics  wave  study.  These  parameters  for  the  boundary 

conditions could only be transferrable between the models only when the wave number vectors 

are correctly set up.  

Figure 6  is taken from the literature [18] and shows the phonon wave dispersion curves for a 

silicone  structure  with  air  holes  of  90  nm  diameter.  Figure 6  also  shows  the  simulated  version 

using the Solid mechanic study for the same structure.

Figure 7 is taken from the literature [17] and shows the wave dispersion curves and their 

band structure of a simple two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal. The photonic crystal consists of 

a vacuum square lattice with dielectric rods which are transverse magnetic polarization with an 

electric field along the rod axis. The photonic crystal is used for the study of electromagnetic wave 

propagation while the phonon crystal is used for the study of the acoustic wave counterpart [19].

The model used for the study of the electromagnetic wave has the electric field components solved 

for  out-of-plane  vector  using  the  wave  equation  for  refractive  index.  In  the  model,  the  lattice 

constant is “a”, the radius is set at R = 0.2a, the speed of light is “c”, the relative permittivity is ε 

= 12.5, and permeability u = 1.

literature [17] (Left) and from our COMSOL simulation model (Right). 

Figure 8 is taken from the literature [11] and shows the wave dispersion curves and their band 

structure of a phonon crystal including the cylindrical polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipe in the air. In 

the phonon crystal, the diameter of the cylindrical polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipe is D = 25.8 mm 

and  the  lattice  constant  or  the  center-to-center  distance  between  lattice  points  is  a  =  27  mm. 

Material  properties  including  mass  densities,  longitudinal  elastic  wave  speed,  and  transversal 

elastic wave speed in the PVC and air structure are given in Table 2. It is assumed that the PVC 

cylinders  are  infinitely  rigid  in  the  out-of-plane  direction.  An  acoustic  pressure  wave  study  is 

conducted in the frequency domain using a linear elastic wave model with specific mass density 

and speed of sound.

IV.Response surface model of the maximum bandgap of a unit cell 

The  bandgap  magnitude  of  a  unit  cell  can  be  related  to  three  system  geometrical  and 

dimensional  property  parameters:  the  lattice  constant,  the  side  length  (hole’s  radius),  and  the 

thickness. The lattice constant is the side length of the whole square including the hole areas within 

the whole square area. The unit cell side length is the lattice constant minus the hole diameter. The 

thickness  is the  thickness of the  unit  cell. The  variation ranges of the  parameters  are  shown in 

Table 4. 

Table 4. The parameter variation ranges. 

Parameter 
Side Length z1 (nm) 
Lattice Constant z2 (nm) 
Thickness z3 (nm) 

Variation Range 
10-20 
100-150 
1-5 

These parameters have a direct impact on the bandgap magnitude which will be considered 

as  the  response  target  and  will  be  adjusted  in  their  variation  ranges  to  achieve  the  maximum 

bandgap magnitude. The input parameters are arranged in the orthogonal central composite design 

(CCD) to develop the response surface method (RSM) parameter regression prediction model of 

the maximum bandgap magnitude of the square lattice unit cell from the input geometry design 

parameters where the sensitivity of the maximum bandgap magnitude to the input geometry design 

parameters  and  their  interactions  can  be  analyzed.  This  model  can  be  used  to  define  the 

interrelations between the input geometry parameters (the studied variables), and to describe the 

combined effect of all factors with a minimum number of experiments needed to be conducted. 

The  non-linear  relationship  model  between  the  input  parameter  and  output  bandgap 

magnitude  can  be  obtained  from  the  CCD  design  of  the  input  parameters  and  corresponding 

bandgap  magnitude  values  presented  in  Table  5  using  RSM  where  the  corresponding  bandgap 

11 

 
 
 
 
magnitude values are predicted from the validated COMSOL simulation model. The RSM model 

can be applied to analyze the sensitivity of the target bandgap magnitude to the input geometry 

design parameters and their interactions. The RSM model can also be used to predict any target 

output  response  value  from  any  input  geometry  design  parameters  within  their  pre-specified 

variation ranges and to optimize the input geometry design parameters for the maximum bandgap 

magnitude.

It was found from Table 6 that the bandgap magnitude results range from 1.64 to 16.34 

GHz  with  different  parameter  combinations.  The  highest  bandgap  magnitude  of  16.34  GHz  is 

obtained with a side length of 15 nm, a lattice size of 157.902 nm, and a thickness of 3 nm. 

The relationship between the input variables and target response can be approximated in a non-

linear polynomial equation and given by

last column of Table 6. 

The mathematical expression of the regression parameter model for the prediction of the 

bandgap magnitude can be developed and shown in Equation (4). In this equation, the coefficient 

amplitude or its absolute value of each equation term has quantified the magnitude of the effect of 

that specific parameter on the bandgap magnitude. The positive and negative signs represent the 

positive effect and negative effect, respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that the x2 lattice size 

and x3 thickness  have the largest and second-largest positive  effect on the bandgap magnitude, 

while  the  x1  side  length  has  the  least  effect  on  the  bandgap  magnitude.  In  Equation  (4),  the 

coefficient magnitudes of the term x1x2, x1x3, and x2x3 represent the interaction effect magnitudes of 

two of the three parameters on the bandgap magnitude. It is seen from Equation (4) that x1x2 has a 

larger  positive  effect  than  x1x3 and x2x3.  The  parameter  x2 gives  the  largest  coefficient  absolute 

value of 4.26. The parameter x1 has the least effect on the bandgap magnitude of only -0.838 as 

shown in Equation (4) which is given by

The RSM model of Equation (4) can be validated by the analysis of variance (ANOVA). 

The results of the ANOVA are shown in Table 7. The P-value of the ANOVA needs to be less 

than 0.05 which represents that there is less than a 5% chance that the corresponding F-value could 

occur due to noise. The P-value is less than 0.05 indicating the model term is significant. The F 

value is used to measure the significance of the overall ANOVA model where a higher F value 

indicates a more accurate and reliable model. For the RSM model to be accurate and significant, 

the P-value needs to be kept  less than 0.05 while the F-value should be  maintained as  high as 

possible. The F-value of the RSM model is as high as 120.06 and the P-value is less than 0.0083, 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
which means that the RSM model is significant with an accurate and reliable prediction. Moreover, 

the coefficient R2 and adjusted R2 of the presented RSM model are 0.9987 and 0.99. A value of the 

coefficient R2 and adjusted R2 close to 1 indicates good model accuracy which has further validated 

the RSM model from a statistical perspective.  

Additionally, the sensitivity of the response target on input parameters can also be validated 

by assessing the F values and P-values of the individual equation terms as shown in Table 7. [20] 

According to Table 7, the F values of the term x2 (lattice constant) of 474.49 and terms x3 (thickness) 

of 199.32 are the largest and second largest among those of all the three parameters. The F value 

of x1 (side length) of 60.94 is the smallest. x1 has the least effect on the bandgap magnitude among 

all  the  three  individual  parameters.  x2 has  the  largest  effect  on  the  bandgap  magnitude.  These 

conclusions have validated the conclusions of the sensitivity of the individual terms and coupling 

terms derived from the coefficients of Equation (4). This means that sensitivities of the response 

target  of  the  maximum  bandgap  magnitude  on  input  parameters  can  also  be  assessed  from  the 

ANOVA results.

Figure 10. The comparison of the bandgap magnitude (GHz) was calculated from the COMSOL 
simulation model and from Equation (4). 

Shown in Fig. 10 is the comparison of the COMSOL simulation results of the response 

target of the maximum bandgap magnitude values which are listed in the second last column of 

Table  6  and  the  prediction  results  of  the  response  target  of  the  maximum  bandgap  magnitude 

values calculated by Equation (4) from the 16 sets of input parameters in Table 6. The prediction 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
results of the response target of the maximum bandgap magnitude values calculated by Equation 

(4) are listed in the last column of Table 6. It is shown that the results calculated by Eq. (4) are 

very close to those of the COMSOL simulation model. In other words, the results in the last two 

columns of Table 6 are very close, which has validated Equation (4) for the bandgap magnitude 

prediction. 

The dimensionless boundary range of all the input parameters from -1 to 1 indicates all the 

parameters  vary  between  their  minimum  value  and  maximum  value.  Within  this  range,  the 

predicted maximum bandgap magnitude value obtained from Equation (4) is 16.355 GHz with a 

parameter combination of the side length of 15.268 nm, the lattice constant of 157.889 nm, and 

the thickness of 2.933 nm, which is higher than the CCD result 16.34 GHz of the optimal parameter 

combination of the side length of 15 nm, the lattice constant of 125 nm and the thickness of 3 nm 

as shown in Table 6. 

The effects of input parameters on the maximum bandgap magnitude have been quantified based 

on the absolute value magnitudes of the coefficients of the individual terms of Equation (4). The 

sensitivity of the maximum bandgap magnitude to input parameters is presented in Figure 11. It is 

shown from  Figure 11  that  the input  parameter of  the largest effect  is the lattice  constant. The 

parameter has a positive effect on the maximum bandgap magnitude. This means that increasing 

the lattice constant will increase the maximum bandgap magnitude. The thickness parameter has 

the second-largest effect and has a negative effect. This means that decreasing the thickness will 

increase the maximum bandgap magnitude. The side length has the least effect on the maximum 

16 

 
bandgap  magnitude.  Therefore,  the  most  efficient  way  to  increase  the  maximum  bandgap 

magnitude is to increase the lattice constant as large as possible and decrease the thickness.

V.Conclusions 

The unit cell has been modelled using a COMSOL finite element analysis model based on the 

parameter setups for its wave vector dispersion curves and their frequency band structures which 

have  been  verified  by  the  results  of  other  literature  simulations.  The  COMSOL  finite  element 

analysis model has been validated by the simulation models of the other literature. The wave vector 

dispersion  curves  of  the  unit  cell  and  the  maximum  bandgap  magnitude  can  be  accurately 

simulated from varying variables such as the side length, the lattice constant, and thickness. The 

validated simulation model has been applied to develop the response surface method parameter 

regression  model  for  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  input  parameters  and  their  interactions.    The 

response  surface  method  parameter  regression  model  is  also  used  for  parameter  design 

optimization  of  the  unit  cell  to  achieve  the  largest  bandgap  magnitude.  Three  geometrical 

parameters of the gap radius, lattice constant, and thickness are selected and arranged according 

to the central composite design. Based on the 16 sets of the COMSOL simulation runs from the 

input  parameter  combinations  of  the  CCD  design,  the  response  target  results  of  the  maximum 

bandgap magnitude values are obtained. The 16 sets of input parameters of the CCD design and 

17 

 
 
 
 
the corresponding response target results of the maximum bandgap magnitude values are used to 

fit the response surface method model. The sensitivity analysis results of the maximum bandgap 

magnitude values to the input parameters and their interactions are quantified from the amplitude 

of  the  coefficients  of  the  individual  RSM  model  equation  terms.  Both  the  RSM  model  and  its 

parameter  sensitivity  analysis  have  been  validated  by  the  ANOVA.  The  maximum  bandgap 

magnitude results of the RSM regression parameter model have also been verified by those of the 

COMSOL simulation model. The RSM regression parameter model has indicated that the lattice 

constant  has  the  largest  effect  on  the  bandgap  magnitude.  The  largest  bandgap  magnitude 

calculated  from  the  RSM  regression  parameter  model  is  16.355  GHz  with  the  parameter 

combination of the side length of 15.268 nm, the lattice constant of 157.889 nm, and the thickness 

of 2.933 nm. The optimization results have been verified by those calculated by the COMSOL 

simulation model from the input parameter combinations arranged by the CCD. Both the RSM 

model and COMSOL model have predicted a similar maximum bandgap magnitude of 16.34 GHz. 

Therefore, it can be concluded that the maximum bandgap magnitude of the unit cell has been 

greatly increased through the input parameter optimization.
