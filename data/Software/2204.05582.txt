Abstract 

Information and communications technology (ICT) within the agricultural sector is characterized by a widespread use 
of  proprietary  data  formats,  a  strong  lack  of  interoperability  standards,  and  a  tight  connection  to  specific  hardware 
implementations resulting from vendor lock-in. This partly explains why ICT has not yet had its full impact within the 
domain.  By  utilizing  the  vast  amount  of  publicly  available  open  data,  ranging  from  topographic  maps  to  multispectral 
satellite images, the economically and environmentally optimal farming practices can be advanced beyond state of the art. 
This paper addresses the potential of applying publicly available information sources to improve crop production, with 
emphasis  on  yield  optimization.  This  potential  is  evaluated  based  on  free  public  data  for  the  growth  season  2016  by 
examining winter wheat production for a selected region in Denmark. Data aggregation is performed by promoting open-
source software tools as a foundation for decision support. That allows the farmer, or another domain expert, to query a 
certain crop type, merge this information with other data sets, and perform analysis on data ranging from sub-field analysis 
to  statistics  on  national/regional  scale.  The  registration  of  field  polygons  and  sowed  crop  types  for  fields  in  Denmark, 
alongside with detailed geographic data and free satellite images, enable us to exploit publicly available data of high quality, 
which can be applied to perform further analysis. 

This work presents results from the Future Cropping partnership, aiming to improve crop production in Denmark. The 
direct benefits of employing a data infrastructure exhibiting a high degree of flexibility are addressed, alongside with a 
discussion on the importance.

1. Introduction

The  agricultural  sector  occupies  roughly  38%  of  the  surface  area  of  the  Earth,  with  large  parts  of  the  rest  being 
unsuitable for farming, such as deserts, mountains, and cities (Foley et al., 2011). From 1985 to 2005, this area has only 
increased by 2.4%, and the extra area was mostly gained through deforestation in tropical parts of the world, which is a 
non-viable solution (Foley et al., 2011). The food demand is expected to double from 2005 to 2050 (Tilman et al., 2011), 
hence the yield of the current fields must be increased. By bringing the yield within 95% of the potential of the field for 16 
types of crops, it is estimated that an increase of 58% of food production can be obtained (Foley et al., 2011). One practice 
to facilitate this is the use of data-driven precision agriculture to take intra-field variations into consideration. 

A requirement for precision agriculture is access to data, and in recent years, open data have continued to become more 
easily available. In particular, organized governmental data of high potential  value is accessible from several countries 
(Harris & Baumann, 2014). The data themselves and the accessibility to them does not automatically create value however, 
they  must  be  processed  to  obtain  information  and  knowledge.  To  facilitate  this,  open  source  software  packages  are 
progressing  tremendously,  and  have  recently  become  sophisticated  enough  to  match  their  proprietary  counterparts 
(Steiniger & Bocher, 2009). 

Information and communication technology (ICT) within the agricultural sector for obtaining site-specific farming has 
had a slow adoption rate, partly due to the lack of standardization and partly because it required a shift from field-level 
data to a Geographic Information System (GIS) infrastructure (Nikkilä et al., 2010). Open source software solutions have 
progressed tremendously in recent years and have been complemented by open data of high quality, such as the Sentinel 2 
satellite images, providing 12 spectral bands in resolutions down to 10 m × 10 m. Furthermore, the agricultural domain is 
focusing on standardizing the data, making it feasible to, e.g., collect data from machinery and merge it with satellite data 
and topographic maps for decision support (Nash et al., 2009). 

The Future Cropping partnership is a Danish research project with the goal of advancing the agricultural sector beyond 
current state of the art. As a collaboration between two universities and eleven companies, it aims to close the gap between 
academia and industry, with special emphasis on the opportunities in data-driven agriculture and precision farming.  A 
clear goal is to ease the process for the farmer to apply site-specific farming, by investigating methods to improve data 
communication between involved instances, ranging from consultants and farmers to big data algorithms and machinery.

Furthermore, data mining techniques will be used to extract valuable information from the large amounts of data within 
the domain. This enables the agricultural sector to improve yield while minimizing the environmental impact.  

This  paper  investigates  the  use  of  open  data  for  precision  agriculture,  and  demonstrates  a  proof  of  concept 
implementation of a GIS toolkit providing a web interface and analysis capabilities, entirely based on open source software. 
The toolkit facilitates the use of open data sources, making it possible to perform decision support to complement existing 
farm management information systems. Two use cases are presented to evaluate the potential of the toolkit: one for sub-
field analysis and one for statistics on a regional scale. 

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: First, we describe the methods including the open data and open source 
software in Section II. In Section III, the results will be presented and discussed through two use cases, before Section IV 
concludes the paper and provides comments on future work. 

Our work applies GeoNode for data management and QGIS for data analysis. The open data were comprised of field 

polygons, topographic maps, satellite images, and orthophotos. 

2. Materials and Methods

GeoNode is an open geospatial content management system based on mature open source software packages, such as 
GeoExplorer to provide GIS data in a web application, GeoServer as a data manager using GeoNetwork for catalogization, 
and PostgreSQL with a PostGIS extension as database. The setup can be used for uploading/downloading data, browsing, 
sharing, and managing GIS data. It employs a user-based structure, with the capability of authentication requirements for 
specific data. In Figure 1, an overview of the included software packages is presented.  

Figure 1. Overview of the open source software used in this paper. 

The  setup  in  Figure  1  is  highly  flexible,  and  can  be  modified  according  to  user  needs.  GeoNode  is  deployed  on  a 
virtualized server infrastructure that can be scaled horizontally as the demand for processing power and memory increases. 
Users can upload and share measurement or machine data in Shape or GeoTIFF formats, for central storage and for sharing 
it  with,  e.g.,  consultants/agronomists.  It  is  based  on  standardized  formats  and  interfaces,  and  the  data  manager,  most 
importantly GeoServer, supports standard geospatial protocols, such as the Web Map Service (WMS) and the Web Feature 
Service (WFS). This allows for easy querying of data by 3rd party products.

Figure 2 shows the data flow in the setup. The topographic maps and the orthophotos were provided by The Danish 
Geodata  Agency,  and  the  field  polygons  were  provided  by  The  Danish  AgriFish  Agency.  The  satellite  images  were

provided by The European Space Agency (ESA), and comprises of multispectral images from the Sentinel 2 satellite. 

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated from the following expression provided by ESA

QGIS was used to analyze and process the data with its multitude of plugins, alongside with its seamless integration 
with the programming language R for statistics purposes. QGIS runs on a regular workstation and connects to the data via 
the  GeoServer.  The  processed  data  were  then  uploaded  to  GeoNode,  such  that  all  raw  and  processed  data  were  stored 
centrally, with easy access to create maps and investigate results through the web interface, or to download the desired 
data. It should be noted that the entire system can also be hosted on a local server to ensure data privacy. 

The open source toolkit presented in this paper follows a simple installation procedure, and provides possibilities of 
cloud computing for storage,  sharing and visualization. GeoNode was customized to form the “Future Cropping Data 
Platform”, as seen in Figure 3, and was setup on a local server with public access.

3. Results and Discussion

To evaluate the potential of the open source toolkit and data, we focused on two use cases. Case 1 was for the farmer 

and agronomist to easily access the farmer’s data, and to be able to investigate his crops from satellite images and 
topographic maps. Case 2 was for researchers to perform statistics on a regional or national/regional scale, and 
demonstrate how the data can be applied for further analysis. 

3.1. Use case 1: Sub-field scale analysis 

The ability of assessing the status of crops remotely and compare it to previous years, results in several possibilities for 
the  farmers  and  consultants/agronomists.  By  investigating  NDVI  maps  and  topographic  maps,  explanations  for  crops 
performing poorly can be investigated. In Figure 4, we investigate the potential of using the NDVI map from the Sentinel 
2 satellite to assess the status of a field.

By overlaying the topographic map with the NDVI map, it is possible to find explanations for poor-performing patches. 
More importantly, it provides information of the spatial extent of the poor-performing patches, leading to a better overview 
of the potential economic impact. This aids in the decision of re-establishment of crops. Furthermore, the NDVI map can 
be used to optimize fertilization, and to calculate a site-specific fertilization map, which can be uploaded to the machinery.

2015) and field polygon, b) shows NDVI map of the field from the Sentinel 2 satellite, c) shows the field with the NDVI 
map and a topographic map, and d) shows an example of an application map based on the NDVI map. 

Further possibilities were investigated by Seelan et al. (2003), where multiple use cases were tested from 1998 to 2001, 
and the economic gain directly coupled to remote sensing was investigated. One use case in the paper is the variable-rate 
nitrogen application for a 30 ha sugar beet field. This use case showed a total saving of US$7326 (US$244 per ha) and a 
35% reduction of the amount of applied nitrogen. The variable-rate zones where determined from an NDVI map based on 
images from the IKONOS satellite. However, obstacles such as expensive image-processing and lack of standardization 
were met.  

In Atzberger (2013), it is stated that access to data is too complicated in the agricultural sector, and that data should be 
easily visualized and downloaded. This obstacle can be circumvented by employing standards from the GIS community. 
Open  source  Spatial  Data  Infrastructures  (SDIs),  such  as  GeoNode,  can  provide  a  platform  for  data-sharing  and 
visualization along with user authentication through a web interface. Furthermore, the support of standardized formats such 
as  GeoTIFF  for  raster  data  and  Shape  files  for  vector  data  is  an  important  factor  to  ensure  interoperability  with  other 
software packages.

3.2. Use case 2: Regional scale analysis 

In Figure 5, we queried winter wheat fields and merged satellite data on the polygons. The mean NDVI value for each 

field was calculated using the Zonal Statistics plugin in QGIS, and used to highlight fields performing poorly.

Figure 5. Regional scale analysis based on Sentinel 2 satellite imagery on 5 May 2016 – a) shows winter wheat fields 
(yellow) on top of an NDVI map and b) shows these fields categorized after their mean NDVI values. 

By having the data in a standardized format, proper interoperability between software packages is ensured, and several 
analysis possibilities becomes easily available. The histograms in Figure 6 were made by running R scripts in QGIS. These 
show the possibilities of performing regional and even national scale analysis. They provide a tool to benchmark fields 
against each other, and grants a valuable overview of the status of the fields. Furthermore, the analysis was carried out on 
a regular workstation.

fields on 5 May 2016 in Jutland, Denmark.

The value of performing these types of statistics is to draw conclusions on the general status of the fields, following, 
e.g., a harsh winter. This is of high relevance for the entire value chain, from the seed suppliers to determine whether a 
large quantity of crops will be re-established, to farmers determining the crop yield and banks to assess the economic status 
of the current growing season.

It should be noted that the NDVI maps and the statistics based on them in this paper do incorporate a certain degree of 
uncertainty. Issues such as atmospheric disturbances are not considered, and other vegetation indices might prove to be 
superior regarding the Sentinel 2 satellite (Frampton et al., 2013). The analytical strength of the presented setup, however, 
lies in its flexibility. It provides a way to quickly calculate the desired vegetation index, easily perform various calculations 
based on these, and to carry out a broad range of statistical analysis in a straightforward manner.  

4.  Conclusions

We have   demonstrated  a  proof  of  concept  toolkit,  where  a  data  platform  was  implemented  by using  the  GeoNode 
framework and complementing this with QGIS as an analysis tool. The data platform grants the user access to a simple 
interface for data sharing based on a GIS web interface. It employs mature software packages and is designed to be easily 
modified and extended. Topographic maps, field polygons, and satellite images were collected in the data platform. These 
data can be basis for decision support on a sub-field scale, and can be supplemented by machine and sensor data from the 
farmer. Furthermore, analysis and statistics on a regional or even national scale can be performed using only open data and 
open source software. 

Several directions for future work are feasible, ranging from data communication and ICT infrastructure to data analysis 
of open data, machine data, and remote sensing data. In particular, data analysis based on the ESA Copernicus program 
encompassing the Sentinel satellites, complemented by a standardized GIS platform to ensure a seamless data connection 
from satellite to machinery, seems very promising
