ABSTRACT

White dwarfs have been successfully used as cosmochronometers in the literature, however their
reach has been limited in comparison to their potential. We present wdwarfdate, a publicly available
Python package to derive the Bayesian age of a white dwarf, based on its eﬀective temperature (Teﬀ )
and surface gravity (log g). We make this software easy to use with the goal of transforming the usage
of white dwarfs as cosmochronometers into an accessible tool. The code estimates the mass and cooling
age of the white dwarf, as well as the mass and main-sequence age of the progenitor star, allowing for
a determination of the total age of the object. We test the reliability of the method by estimating
the parameters of white dwarfs from previous studies, and ﬁnd agreement with the literature within
measurement errors. By analysing the limitation of the code we ﬁnd a typical uncertainty of 10% on
the total age when both input parameters have uncertainties of 1%, and an uncertainty of 25% on the
total age when Teﬀ has an uncertainty of 10% and log g of 1%. Furthermore, wdwarfdate assumes
single star evolution, and can be applied to calculate the total age of a white dwarf with parameters
in the range 1, 500 (cid:46) Teﬀ (cid:46) 90, 000 K and 7.9 (cid:46) log g (cid:46) 9.3. Finally, the code assumes a uniform
mixture of C/O in the core and single star evolution, which is reliable in the range of white dwarf
masses 0.45 − 1.1 M(cid:12) (7.73 (cid:46) log g (cid:46) 8.8).

1. INTRODUCTION

White dwarfs are the perfect candidates to use as cos-
mochronometers. These degenerate objects are formed
with high temperatures from the death of stars with

masses < 8 M(cid:12), and cool over time. The cooling pro-
cess is understood to the point that by deriving the ef-
fective temperature (Teﬀ [K]) and surface gravity (log g
[cm s−2], units for log g will be implicit from now on to
simplify notation) from observational data we can es-
timate how long it has been cooling with a relatively
high accuracy (e.g., Fontaine et al. 2001; B´edard et al.
2020). These cooling models, combined with stellar evo-

lutionary models (e.g., Choi et al. 2016; Dotter 2016)
and the initial-to-ﬁnal mass relation (IFMR, e.g., Cum-
mings et al. 2018; El-Badry et al. 2018; Marigo et al.
2020), provide a reliable method to estimate the total
age of a white dwarf. In addition, with the release of
Gaia DR2 and EDR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016,
2018; Brown et al. 2021), a large number of new white
dwarfs have been discovered –about 10 times more than
previously known– that have precise proper motions and
parallaxes measured by Gaia (e.g., Gentile Fusillo et al.
2019, 2021; McCleery et al. 2020).

The Gaia mission also allowed for the identiﬁcation
of binaries with unprecedented precision (e.g., El-Badry
& Rix 2018; El-Badry et al. 2021). Given that it can
be assumed that the components of a binary system
were born at approximately the same time,
identify-
ing white dwarfs with wide co-moving companions al-
lows us to calculate the age of the system under the as-
sumption that each object has likely evolved as a single
star, without phases of mass transfer or common enve-
lope evolution (Bodenheimer 2011). Stellar age is one
of the most diﬃcult fundamental properties to measure
directly; although some methods such as gyrochronol-
ogy (e.g., Skumanich 1972; Barnes 2003; Van Saders
et al. 2016), asteroseismology (e.g., Chaplin et al. 2014;
Aguirre et al. 2017) and isochrone ﬁtting (e.g., Baraﬀe
et al. 2015; Ag¨ueros et al. 2018; Berger et al. 2020) can
yield relatively precise ages for single stars, they are
limited to speciﬁc ranges of masses, or stages of main-
sequence evolution, in which they can be applied (e.g.,
Chabrier & Baraﬀe 1997; Baraﬀe et al. 2015; Rodr´ıguez
et al. 2016). For example, none of these methods can
be applied to low-mass stars (< 0.6 M(cid:12)). Binary stars
provide a powerful tool to estimate stellar ages “inde-
pendently of mass”: the age of a star of any mass can
be estimated if it is co-moving with another object which
can be age-dated.

White dwarf cosmochronology is the subject of exten-
sive literature. Some examples include Kalirai (2012),
who calculated the ages of white dwarfs in the Milky
Way halo to study its formation; Gagn´e et al. (2018),
who estimated the age of the ultra-massive white dwarf
GD 50 to reﬁne the age of the AB Dor moving group
which GD 50 belongs to; Anguiano et al. (2017), who
estimated white dwarf parameters, including their ages,
to study the formation of the Galactic disk; Catal´an
(2015) who used white dwarf-white dwarf binaries to
calibrate the low-mass end of the IFMR; and Kilic et al.
(2019), who used white dwarf ages to study the Milky
way inner halo. In addition to these, other studies (e.g.,
Garc´es et al. 2011 and Fouesneau et al. 2019) have es-
timated the age of main-sequence stars by calculating

the age of co-moving white dwarf companions. Fur-
thermore, previous studies have presented software li-
braries that can be used to estimate white dwarf ages:
WD models1 (S. Cheng, priv. comm.) is a Python library
to estimate white dwarf parameters from Gaia photom-
etry, although it does not provide measurement uncer-
tainties for these parameters; and BASE-92 (von Hippel
et al. 2006, 2014) is a C++ library that estimates star
cluster and stellar parameters from photometry, and in
particular can be used to estimate white dwarf and pro-
genitor masses and ages. BASE-9 uses a Bayesian tech-
nique, combined with a Markov chain Monte Carlo and
numerical integration techniques to estimate the pos-
terior probability distributions of the diﬀerent parame-
ters, including age. As a consequence, BASE-9 results
complicated to implement, in particular when only the
parameters of the white dwarf are needed. This shows
the incredible potential of estimating total ages of white
dwarfs, and the lack of tools to make it accessible.

In this paper, we present wdwarfdate, a new Python
library to estimate the total age of a white dwarf with
the associated uncertainty, from Teﬀ (K), log g, and at-
mospheric composition. The goal of this software is to
make the usage of white dwarf as cosmochronometers
accessible. Therefore, this code is designed to be easily
used, with warnings for the corresponding limitations of
the theoretical models applied in the process. The es-
timation of the white dwarf age is done using Bayesian
statistics under the assumptions of a white dwarf core
with uniform mixture of C/O and single star evolution.
wdwarfdate also calculates the mass and cooling age of
the white dwarf and the mass and main-sequence age of
its progenitor star, along with their respective uncertain-
ties (and their full probability densities) which include
scatter in the IFMR and propagate the measurement
errors of the white dwarf parameters used as an input.
This paper is divided into the following sections:
in
Section 2, we describe the general method used to es-
timate the total age of a white dwarf (Section 2.1),
the models that were included for the age determina-
tion (i.e., cooling tracks, IFMRs and stellar evolution-
ary models; Section 2.2), the Bayesian framework on
which wdwarfdate relies (Section 2.3), and the fast-test
mode, an alternative method to estimate the parameters
of the white dwarf included in the code (Section 2.4).
In Section 3, we apply wdwarfdate to calculate the to-
tal ages of a reference sample of age-calibrated white
dwarfs to validate our method. We also estimate the

ages of 18 white dwarfs in wide co-moving pair candi-
dates with M dwarfs (Section 3.3) to provide a sample
of age-calibrated M dwarfs for future studies.
In Sec-
tion 4, we detail the constraints and assumptions that
are required in using wdwarfdate. Our results are sum-
marized in Section 5.

2. METHOD

In this section, we describe the sequential steps re-
quired to calculate the mass and cooling age of the
white dwarf, as well as the mass and the main-sequence
age of the progenitor star, and ﬁnally the total age of
the object. wdwarfdate will derive ages using Bayesian
statistics –Bayesian age– by default, but the code also
includes a fast-test mode, an alternative method to es-
timate the parameters of a white dwarf, and we explain
both in this section. We also describe the models in
which wdwarfdate relies for the parameter estimation.
For an example on how to use wdwarfdate see Appendix
A.

2.1. Outline of the algorithm

The calculation of the total age using wdwarfdate re-
lies on a precise measurement of Teﬀ and log g. The
estimation of these two parameters is done from obser-
vational data, and it is described in Section 2.2. From
Teﬀ and log g, the process to estimate the total age of a
white dwarf is divided into four stages, summarized in
Figure 1:

1. From the Teﬀ and log g input values combined with
cooling evolutionary tracks for the white dwarf we
obtain its mass (ﬁnal mass, mf ) and cooling age
(tcool).

2. From the mf we estimate the mass of the progen-
itor star (initial mass, mi) using an IFMR, which
are, in most cases, empirically calibrated.

3. With the mi combined with stellar evolution
tracks we estimate its evolutionary lifetime, mean-
ing the time since the star formed until it became
a white dwarf, which we will call main sequence
age or lifetime in this work (tms).

4. Finally, adding tcool and tms, we obtain the total

age of the object (ttot).

These steps depend on models which assume single
star evolution.
If a white dwarf interacted with an-
other object at any point, then the evolutionary models
will not reproduce its parameters correctly (e.g., Marsh
1995; Brown et al. 2011). In Section 4 we discuss diﬀer-
ent scenarios where the single star evolution assumption
might not be valid.

Figure 1. Steps required to estimate a white dwarf total age
from an eﬀective temperature and surface gravity (Teﬀ and
log g). In this diagram, mf and mi are the ﬁnal mass (mass
of the white dwarf) and initial mass (mass of the progeni-
tor star), and tcool, tms and ttot are the cooling age of the
white dwarf, the main sequence age of the progenitor star
and the total age of the object, respectively. σx indicates the
uncertainty of each parameter x.

2.2. Models incorporated in wdwarfdate

The accuracy and precision of the estimated funda-
mental white dwarf parameters using wdwarfdate de-
pend strongly on how the two input observables were de-
termined, the obtained values, and uncertainties. In ad-
dition, to initialize wdwarfdate the user needs to choose
between cooling models for DA white dwarf and non-
DA, an IFMR and a stellar evolution model for the pro-
genitor star (metallicity and rotation). In this section,
we describe the methods generally used to estimate Teﬀ
and log g in the literature and how they aﬀect predic-
tions by wdwarfdate. We also describe the models in-
cluded in wdwarfdate for each of the choices described
above, as summarized in Table 1.

The determination of temperature and surface grav-
ity generally rely on either a photometric or a spectro-
scopic approach. Photometric methods rely on accurate
trigonometric parallaxes and high precision photometry
(e.g. Koester et al. 1979) to reconstruct the spectral
energy distribution of a white dwarf, and requires an
accurate knowledge of the extinction caused by inter-
stellar dust. Spectroscopic methods, however, rely on
atmosphere models to reproduce the detailed proﬁles of

4

Kiman et al.

hydrogen or helium lines, and depend on their theoret-
ical line proﬁles (e.g. Bergeron et al. 1992; Beauchamp
et al. 1999). These line proﬁles in most cases approx-
imate the white dwarf atmosphere as a 1-dimensional
object, which can lead to biases in some extreme cases
of white dwarf properties, and in most cases ignore the
impact of magnetic ﬁelds which can be signiﬁcant for the
most massive white dwarfs. Recent studies using data
from Gaia DR2 and the spectroscopic method show that
the results from these two techniques generally agree
within the uncertainties (Tremblay et al. 2019), except
for Teﬀ (cid:46) 6500 K where the parallax-based photomet-
ric estimations of log g were found to be more accurate
than spectroscopic estimations (Napiwotzki et al. 2020;
Kawka & Vennes 2012).

wdwarfdate relies on the theoretical evolutionary se-
quences of the Montreal White Dwarf Group (B´edard
et al. 2020). These models assume that the white dwarf
has a core composed of a uniform carbon and oxygen
mixture (XC = XO = 0.5), surrounded by a He layer
(with a fractional mass qHe = MHe/M∗ = 10−2) sur-
rounded by an outermost H layer. The evolutionary
tracks assume that this outermost H layer is “thick”
(qH ≡ MH/M∗ = 10−4) for hydrogen-atmosphere white
dwarfs (DA white dwarf), and “thin” (qH = 10−10) for
helium-atmosphere white dwarfs (non-DA white dwarf;
B´edard et al. 2020). The publicly available Montreal
cooling tracks were calculated for masses in the range
0.2−1.3 M(cid:12) in steps of 0.05 M(cid:12). These tracks are shown
in Figure 2 in black, together with the limits within
which wdwarfdate was designed to function in terms of
Teﬀ and log g, shown in a blue dashed line. These lim-
its are based on the following limitations: (1) the low-
est temperature covered by the cooling tracks (1500 K);
(2) the full range of white dwarf masses covered by
the cooling tracks (0.2 − 1.3 M(cid:12)); and (3) the 0.3 Myr
isochrone, given that cooling ages below this value are
unreliable. In summary, the approximate limits within
which wdwarfdate will rely on the cooling tracks are:
1, 500 (cid:54) Teﬀ (cid:46) 100, 000 K and 7.0 (cid:54) log g (cid:46) 9.3. Sec-
tion 4 details additional limitations of wdwarfdate.

To estimate the progenitor mass from the white dwarf
mass, or vice versa, the user can choose among the
following IFMRs: Cummings et al. (2018, MIST- and
PARSEC-based), Marigo et al. (2020), Salaris et al.
(2009) and Williams et al. (2009), shown in Figure 3
with semi-empirical data from Cummings et al. (2018).
Below we describe each of these IFMRs. Cummings
et al. (2018) used white dwarf members of open clus-
ters with known ages to derive the expected progeni-
tor mass and constrain the IFMR of relatively massive
(and young) white dwarfs. Their analysis is based on

Figure 2. White dwarf cooling tracks from B´edard et al.
(2020) for thick (qH ≡ MH/M∗ = 10−4) and thin (qH =
10−10) H layers (left and right panels, respectively). The
cooling tracks cover white dwarf masses in the range 0.2 −
1.3 M(cid:12) in steps of 0.05 M(cid:12). The limits of region in the (log g,
Teﬀ ) plane where wdwarfdate relies on cooling tracks are
shown with blue dashed lines. We also included isochrones

where the density of isochrones increases.

a spectroscopic determination of the white dwarfs Teﬀ
and log g, which was then used to estimate the cool-
ing age and mass of the white dwarf using the Fontaine
et al. (2001) cooling tracks. These models are valid
for Teﬀ (cid:46) 30, 000 K, and were updated by the more re-
cent B´edard et al. (2020) cooling tracks. By subtract-
ing the cooling age from the age of the host open clus-
ter, they obtained the main-sequence age of the progen-
itor star, which they then used to estimate the progen-
itor mass using the PAdova and TRieste Stellar Evo-
lution Code (PARSEC, Bressan et al. 2012) and the
models computed using the Modules for Experiments in
Stellar Astrophysics (MESA, Paxton et al. 2011, 2013,
2015, 2018):
the MESA Isochrones & Stellar Tracks
(MIST, Choi et al. 2016; Dotter 2016). These two fam-
ilies of stellar evolutionary models resulted in two dis-
tinct IFMRs, both of which are included in wdwarfdate.
The diﬀerence between the initial masses calculated
for the two IFMR are generally within 5%. By de-
fault, wdwarfdate uses the MIST-based IFMR as rec-
ommended by Cummings et al. (2018), due to the non-
rotating MIST isochrones estimating more precise ages
for young stars (∼ 100 Myr), as tested with the Pleiades
cluster. However, the PARSEC-based IFMR should
be considered especially for high-mass progenitor stars
(> 5 M(cid:12)), given that the MIST models tend to under-
estimate masses in this range.

The semi-empirical IFMR from Marigo et al. (2020),
was also obtained from white dwarfs from known clus-
ters. In particular, they included seven new white dwarf
members of the old open clusters NGC 752 (1.55 Gyr)
and Ruprecht 147 (2.5 Gyr), which allowed them to
study the low-mass end (around 0.5 M(cid:12)) of the IFMR in

detail. In addition, Marigo et al. (2020) used a new anal-
ysis technique which combines photometric and spectro-
scopic data to estimate precise Teﬀ , log g and mf , and
to conﬁrm cluster membership for the white dwarfs. As
shown in Figure 3, they found a kink at low-masses,
which they associated with the formation of carbon stars
in the Galaxy. The IFMR from Salaris et al. (2009) also
used white dwarfs from known clusters to calibrate the
relation, but put special emphasis in the models used,
and performed a detailed analysis of the sources of un-
certainties and scatter in the relation. Finally, the IFMR
from Williams et al. (2009) studied white dwarfs from
the intermediate-age open cluster M35 (NGC 2168),
which provided information to constrain the higher-mass
end of the IFMR.

The IFMRs included in wdwarfdate depend on clus-
ter objects that are younger and therefore more mas-
sive than average ﬁeld white dwarfs, which could cause
a bias in the relation.
In addition, as some of the
IFMRs were done prior to the Gaia mission, and many
of these objects were assumed to be cluster members
based on their kinematics and colours, without paral-
laxes, some of these objects might not be true mem-
bers, biasing the relation. The IFMR will also place
an extra boundary in the limits of Teﬀ and log g for
which wdwarfdate can estimate a total age. For ex-
ample, Cummings et al. (2018) MIST-based IFMR was
calibrated for white dwarf masses between 0.5 − 1.3 M(cid:12),
which will place a tight constraint specially in the lowest
value possible of log g. We will discuss these limitations
further in Section 4.

The IFMRs from Cummings et al. (2018) and Marigo
et al. (2020) are calibrated for mi > 0.83 M(cid:12), and we in-
cluded them in the code extending this limit to 0.45 M(cid:12),
assuming a constant mf between 0.45 < mi < 0.83 (gray
line in Figure 3). This extension allows wdwarfdate
to estimate parameters for white dwarfs with masses
mf (cid:46) 0.6 M(cid:12), which is the peak of the white dwarf mass
distribution (e.g., Genest-Beaulieu & Bergeron 2019).
To estimate the main sequence age from the initial
mass, or progenitor mass, we adopted in wdwarfdate
the MIST isochrones. These tracks cover a mass range
between 0.1 − 300 M(cid:12) with a step of 0.05 M(cid:12), and an
age range from 0.1 Myr to 13.8 Gyr. To select the opti-
mal stellar evolution track, the user has to choose the
metallicity and rotation of the progenitor star among
[Fe/H] = {−4, −1, 0, 0.5} (dex),
the following options:
[α/Fe] = 0, and v/vcrit = {0.0, 0.4}. We will discuss
the eﬀects of using diﬀerent tracks on the total age in
Section 4.

In this section, we describe the Bayesian method im-
plemented in wdwarfdate. Our code derives Bayesian
ages of white dwarfs, with a posterior probability given
by

p(mi, log10 tcool, ∆m|Teﬀ , log g)

(1)

where mi is the initial mass, or the mass of the pro-
genitor star, and tcool is the cooling age of the white
dwarf. ∆m is an extra parameter which takes into ac-
count the scatter in the IFMR of white dwarfs, and it

is described below. Teﬀ and log g are the inputs for the
eﬀective temperature and surface gravity, respectively.
To simplify notation we did not include uncertainties
in Equation 1, although these are also required in the
code. Using Bayes theorem, the posterior probability in
Equation 1 can be written as

p(mi, log10 tcool,∆m|Teﬀ , log g) ∝

p(Teﬀ , log g|mi, log10 tcool, ∆m)
p(log10 tcool)p(mi)p(∆m),

(2)

where p(log10 tcool), p(mi) and p(∆m) are the priors on
the cooling age, the initial mass and ∆m respectively,
which are described below, and

the white dwarf and ˆmf is the scattered mass, because
it was calculated using the IFMR.

The priors indicated in the posterior probability of
Equation 2 are given by the Star Formation History
(SFH) for tcool and the Initial Mass Function (IMF) for
mi. We assume a constant SFH (e.g., Madau & Dick-
inson 2014) and applied it as a ﬂat prior on ttot, where
we required ttot < 15 Gyr to avoid a sharp cut at the
age of the Universe in the age probability distributions.
As ttot = tcool + tms, the Jacobian of the coordinate
transformation is 1, and this prior could be used with-
out extra modiﬁcations.
In addition, we assumed the
IMF to be m−2.3
(Kroupa 2001; Chabrier 2003), which
describes the range of stellar masses expected to form a
white dwarf.

is the likelihood. Teﬀ and log g in Equation 3 are the
modeled eﬀective temperature and surface gravity of the
white dwarf. These modeled quantities are calculated
from the three parameters that are being sampled (mi,
tcool and ∆m) as shown by the probabilistic graphical
model in Figure 4, which represents the posterior prob-
ability of the problem. In summary: 1) From the initial
mass (mi) we estimate a main sequence age (tms); 2) by
adding tms to the cooling age (tcool) we obtain the total
age (ttot) of the white dwarf; 3) from mi and the delta
parameter (∆m) we estimate a ﬁnal mass (mf , described
below); 4) from mf and tcool we estimate the modeled
eﬀective temperature and surface gravity (Teﬀ and log g)
which are compared to the input parameters (Teﬀ and
log g) to estimate the posterior probability. The models
used in each step are described in Section 2.2.

The ∆m parameter in Equations 1, 2 and 3 was in-
cluded to model the scatter in the IFMR. This scatter
has diﬀerent causes including contamination from non-
cluster members, measurement errors, metallicity vari-
ations, inconsistencies with the models used and age
determination of the clusters (e.g., Weidemann 2000;
Williams et al. 2009; Casewell et al. 2009). The param-
eter ∆m is drawn from a normal distribution centered
at zero with standard deviation σm, so that

p(∆m) = N (0, σm).

(4)

We estimated the parameter σm from the Cummings
et al. (2018) data, and adopted σm = 0.03 M(cid:12). The
inclusion of the scatter in the posterior is indicated in
Figure 4 as ˆmf = mf + ∆m, where mf is the true mass of

Figure 4. Probabilistic Graphical Model for the Bayesian
method of wdwarfdate.
In short, Teﬀ and log g are calcu-
lated from the parameters being sampled (mi, tcool and ∆m),
and these values are compared to the input parameters. In
the ﬁgure, ˆmf is the scattered ﬁnal mass (mass of the white
dwarf) calculated from the initial mass using an IFMR, and
∆m is an extra parameter to take into account the scatter in
this relation. Therefore, mf is the true ﬁnal mass, calculated
by adding ∆m to ˆmf .

wdwarfdate obtains the probability distributions by
explicitly integrating over the likelihood and priors to
perform the normalization. We set the code to evaluate
the posterior in a grid made of discrete arrays for each
parameter: mi, log10 tcool and ∆m. The code ﬁrst per-
forms a wide grid evaluation with the parameters rang-
ing between 0.3 Myr < tcool < 15 Gyr, 0.1 M(cid:12) < mi <
10 M(cid:12) and −0.1 M(cid:12) < ∆m < 0.1 M(cid:12). Then it obtains
the probability distribution for each parameter by set-
ting the minimum and maximum evaluation limits ac-
cording to where the probability is higher. These limits
can also be adjusted by the user. We use these results
combined with the models described in Section 2.2 to
derive probability distributions for the rest of the pa-
rameters (total age, ﬁnal mass and main sequence age).

2.4. Fast-test method

One of the limitations of wdwarfdate is given by the
IFMR: the total age of a white dwarf can be estimated
only in the cases where its mass is between the allowed
limits of the IFMR. For the cases where a total age can-
not be estimated but the Teﬀ and log g are within the
limits of the cooling tracks, we included in wdwarfdate
a fast-test method to estimate the ﬁnal mass and cooling
age only. For this method, wdwarfdate generates two
normal distributions for the eﬀective temperature and
surface gravity, using the input values (Teﬀ and log g)
as means, and the uncertainties (σTeff and σlog g) as the
standard deviations of the distributions such as

XTeff ∼ N (Teﬀ , σTeff )
Xlog g ∼ N (log g, σlog g).

(5)

The code does a Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation
by running the two distributions through the process
described in Section 2.1 and in Figure 1, and obtains a
distribution for each of the parameters of interest: ﬁ-
nal mass, initial mass, cooling age, main sequence age
and total age. wdwarfdate will automatically run this
method when the ﬁnal mass of the white dwarf is outside
of the allowed ranges by the IFMR. The main diﬀerence
between the fast-test and the Bayesian methods are the
priors: the fast-test method does not include the IMF
and SFH as priors on the initial mass and the total age,
respectively, but it does constrain the total age to be
smaller than 15 Gyr.

To test that the ﬁnal mass and cooling age esti-
mated with the fast-test and the Bayesian methods
are comparable, we run a grid of white dwarfs with
Teﬀ = 1, 500 − 100, 000 K and log g = 7 − 9.3 and un-
certainties of 10% and 1% respectively, using the two
methods. For both methods we used the DA white

dwarf cooling sequences, the Cummings et al. (2018)
MIST-based IFMR, the MIST tracks with [Fe/H] = 0
and v/vcrit = 0.0, and the uncertainties were calculated
using the 16th and 84th percentile of the distributions.
The results show that the ﬁnal mass estimations agree
within the uncertainties between both methods (right
panel Figure 5), and the cooling age estimations agree
in most cases (left panel Figure 5). We color-coded in
purple the points for which the cooling age diﬀers by
more than 1σ, and we found that these points agree in
the ﬁnal mass within the uncertainty, although the cool-
ing age values seem to be more discrepant as the cool-
ing age decreases. This discrepancy does not depend
on the cooling age because there are some white dwarfs
with small cooling ages which have the same result in
the fast-test and Bayesian method. The purple points
on Figure 5 have some of the highest temperatures and
surface gravities, as shown by the (Teﬀ − log g) inset
diagram in the left panel of Figure 5. Moreover, the
purple points follow the area where the cooling tracks
are closer to each other in Figure 2. This increases the
uncertainty in the cooling age, making the likelihood
probability distribution function (PDF) of these objects
wider. Therefore, the prior, in particular the IMF, has a
bigger eﬀect on the estimated values, making the cooling
ages estimated with the Bayesian method larger, given
that it favors smaller initial masses.

The ﬁnal masses between 0.65 − 0.8 M(cid:12) in the right
panel of Figure 5 are slightly lower with the Bayesian
method than with the fast-test method. This eﬀect is
also caused by the prior, in a similar way as described
above. By inspecting the cooling tracks in Figure 2,
we noticed that the cooling tracks in the mass range
0.65 − 0.8 M(cid:12) are closer to each other, making the likeli-
hood less constrained. The diﬀerences for the ﬁnal mass
and cooling age described above show the advantage of
applying the Bayesian method which adds extra infor-
mation using the priors (IMF and SFH), unlike the fast-
test method which provides the highest likelihood value.
In summary, when the uncertainties in Teﬀ and log g
are small (∼ 10% and ∼ 1%, respectively) the fast-test
and the Bayesian method are comparable in the estima-
tion of ﬁnal masses and cooling ages, except for white
dwarfs with both Teﬀ > 40, 000 K and log g > 8.4, which
coincide with dense track areas. However, these excep-
tions represent only 2% of our sample, and some have
extremely high temperatures, therefore these cases are
not common.

3. RESULTS OF APPLYING WDWARFDATE TO

LITERATURE AND NEW WHITE DWARFS

Kiman et al.

for a detailed description of their work). Given that they
estimated all the parameters which can be obtained with
our code using a similar procedure, Cummings et al.
(2018) is an ideal study to compare the performance of
wdwarfdate.

We run wdwarfdate on all the stars in Cummings
et al. (2018) using the Teﬀ and log g and uncertainties
published in their work. We compared ﬁnal mass, cool-
ing age, initial mass and main sequence age in Figure 6.
Most of the values agree within 1σ with their results.
The uncertainties calculated with wdwarfdate are com-
parable to the estimated by Cummings et al. (2018) for
the cooling age and ﬁnal mass. For the main sequence
age and initial mass, the uncertainties are smaller in the
Cummings et al. (2018) results because they were prop-
agated from the age of the cluster which has a small
uncertainty, and not the IFMR as in wdwarfdate.

We color-coded the white dwarfs for which any of the
parameters in Figure 6 did not agree within 1σ to study
them in detail. The black dot is the white dwarf GD 50,
and although the parameters agree within the uncertain-
ties it is color-coded because it is discussed below. The
white dwarfs color-coded in green and purple are outliers
in the IFMR (Figure 3), which explains why the initial
mass and main sequence age do not agree. We refer to
Cummings et al. (2018) for the analysis of the outliers.
The ﬁnal mass and cooling age for the green objects
agree within uncertainties, which is expected because
we are using the same Teﬀ and log g to estimate them.
In the case of the three white dwarfs color-coded in pur-
ple, wdwarfdate estimated a higher cooling age than ex-
pected according to the parameters in Cummings et al.
(2018). However, these objects have Teﬀ > 50, 000 K,
and the cooling tracks used in Cummings et al. (2018)
(Fontaine et al. 2001) are not suitable for temperatures
> 30, 000 K. We conﬁrmed our calculations of the cool-
ing ages with the Montreal White Dwarfs Data Base
(MWDD, Dufour et al. 2017)3, which contains the up-
dated models by B´edard et al. (2020), which we imple-
mented in wdwarfdate.

To compare the total age estimated with wdwarfdate
with the cluster age, we excluded the outliers (points
color-coded in green and purple) in Figure 6. The total
estimated age agrees within 1σ with the cluster age for
65% of the white dwarfs, and within 2σ for 94%. We also
calculated a median relative diﬀerence of 12% between
the median age for each white dwarf that was not an
outlier and the age according to the cluster membership,

Figure 5. Comparison of the fast-test and Bayesian meth-
ods included in wdwarfdate for the cooling age and ﬁnal mass
(left and right panels, respectively). We included the one-
to-one relation in a black solid line. We run a grid of white
dwarfs with Teﬀ = 1, 500 − 100, 000 K and log g = 7 − 9.3 and
uncertainties of 10% and 1%, respectively. This comparison
shows that the estimation of ﬁnal mass and cooling age using
both methods is similar. The purple points in both panels
represent calculations of cooling age that diﬀer more than
1σ between the two methods. The small panel of Teﬀ and
log g shows that these points are situated in a dense area of
isochrones (Figure 2), which makes the likelihood less con-
strained. As a consequence, the prior has more inﬂuence and
makes the Bayesian cooling ages larger.

of the distributions.

3.1. Comparison to white dwarfs from clusters from

Cummings et al. (2018)

Cummings et al. (2018) used a sample of 79 white
dwarfs from 13 diﬀerent clusters of known ages with
Teﬀ and log g measurements from the literature to cal-
ibrate the IFMR. In addition, the authors re-measured
Teﬀ and log g for 8 of the white dwarfs. Cummings et al.
(2018) is one of the most comprehensive studies to-date
of white dwarfs from clusters. They used the cooling
tracks from the Montreal White Dwarf Group to esti-
mate ﬁnal masses and cooling ages from Teﬀ and log g,
and the MIST isochrones to estimate initial masses from
the cooling and total ages of the objects (See Section 2.2

Figure 6. We run the white dwarfs in Cummings et al.
(2018) using wdwarfdate to compare the results. Most of
the parameters are within 1σ and we color-coded the rest.
Both the green and purple points are outliers in the IFMR. In
addition, the three purple white dwarfs with higher cooling
age have high eﬀective temperatures, which are better mod-
eled with the new cooling tracks implemented in our code
(B´edard et al. 2020). The black dot is the massive white
dwarf GD 50.

which shows wdwarfdate is doing a good job estimating
these total ages.

−3.74 Myr, a cooling age of 82.62+11.19

The white dwarf color-coded in black is GD 50, which
is a young and ultramassive white dwarf of 1.28 ±
0.08 M(cid:12). For this object we obtained a main sequence
age of 46.21+4.76
−14.08 Myr,
a total age of 128.71+10.54
−11.92 Myr, a ﬁnal mass of 1.27 ±
0.02 M(cid:12), and an initial mass of 7.5 ± 0.3 M(cid:12). Our pro-
genitor mass calculation diﬀers slightly from the value
in Cummings et al. (2018), but agrees with the re-
sults of Gagn´e et al. (2018), that calculated a mass of
7.8 ± 0.6 M(cid:12). They found GD 50 is likely member of the
AB Doradus moving group, and performed a detailed
estimation of its parameters using the Montreal white
dwarf evolutionary models and the MIST models, ac-
counting for all possible C/O/Ne core compositions, and
ﬁnding a total age of 117±26 Myr. Our result is between
this value and the one estimated by Cummings et al.
(2018) that assumed GD 50 belongs to the the Pleiades
(based on Dobbie et al. 2006) and assigned it an age of

added in a black vertical line the age of the group. We found
good agreement between the age of the cluster and the age

135 ± 35 Myr, which is slightly larger than the current
measured age of this cluster (112 ± 5 Myr; Dahm 2015).
We also used wdwarfdate on GD 50 using the PARSEC-
based IFMR from Cummings et al. (2018), as was sug-
gested in Section 2.2 for progenitor masses > 5 M(cid:12), and
we obtained a total age of 114.61+12.72
−11.68 Myr, signiﬁcantly
closer to the results of Gagn´e et al. (2018).

3.2. Comparison to white dwarfs from M67 from

Canton et al. (2021)

To test the accuracy of wdwarfdate at lower masses,
we estimated the parameters of the white dwarfs from
Canton et al. (2021). The authors measured Teﬀ and
log g from high resolution spectra for 22 white dwarfs
from the M67 cluster which is 3.5 Gyr and solar metal-
licity. They used the cooling tracks from Fontaine et al.
(2001) to estimate ﬁnal masses from these parameters,
and the PARSEC isochrones to estimate initial masses
from the age of the cluster. They estimated initial
masses only for a smaller vetted sample, and discarded
the rest because, for example, they were potential He-
core white dwarfs or potential blue straggler remnants.
Using their measured Teﬀ and log g, and uncertainties
with wdwarfdate, we found good agreement for ﬁnal
mass and cooling age between our results and Canton
et al. (2021) –as shown in Figure 8– for all but two
white dwarfs. However, our results for these two white

dwarfs agree with the MWDD, therefore the diﬀerences
are likely due to Canton et al. (2021) using an older
version of the Montreal cooling tracks (Fontaine et al.
2001). In addition, we compared our estimation of the
total age and the initial mass for the vetted sample
from Canton et al. (2021), and found that our results
for both parameters agree within 1σ, as shown by the
bottom panels in Figure 8. The uncertainties on the
total age of the white dwarfs are large (±5 Gyr) which
is expected given that these are low-mass white dwarfs
and the largest contribution to the total age comes from
the main sequence age, which tends to have higher un-
certainties. Furthermore, the uncertainties on the initial
mass calculated by Canton et al. (2021) are smaller be-
cause they used the known total age to estimate these
masses, which is well constrained. To further check our
code, we run wdwarfdate using the IFMR from Marigo
et al. (2020) which diﬀers from Cummings et al. (2018)
for low-masses, and found the same results for the me-
dian value of the parameters, although the shape of the
posterior was diﬀerent in some cases, due to the change
in the shape of the IFMR.

3.3. Wide, co-moving white dwarf companions

We used wdwarfdate to estimate ages of 30 white
dwarfs identiﬁed to be candidate wide co-movers with
M dwarfs by Kiman et al. (2021). These M dwarfs
constitute a new set of age-calibrators and we refer the
reader to Kiman et al. (2021) for information about the
main-sequence co-moving star. Kiman et al. (2021) es-
timated the white dwarf ages using wdwarfdate, and
the Teﬀ and log g calculated by Gentile Fusillo et al.
(2019) with photometry from Gaia DR2. For our calcu-
lations we used the updated version of that work (Gen-
tile Fusillo et al. 2021), that took advantage of the pre-
cise photometry and parallaxes from Gaia EDR3 and es-
timated Teﬀ and log g for 359, 073 high-conﬁdence white
dwarf candidates. However, we did not ﬁnd improve-
ment between Gaia DR2 and EDR3 in the relative un-
certainty of Teﬀ and log g for the 30 white dwarfs, and
we found a relative diﬀerence for the values of 8.4% and
2.2% respectively.

All of the 30 objects have a white dwarf probability
> 95% assigned by Gentile Fusillo et al. (2021). How-
ever, one of the white dwarfs does not have an estimation
for Teﬀ and log g. We discarded that source along with
the white dwarfs with masses < 0.5 M(cid:12), or > 1.1 M(cid:12),
according to their position in the color-magnitude dia-
gram (Figure 9) and white dwarfs with GBP−GRP > 0.9.
In short, the reasons for these cuts are that high- and
low-mass white dwarfs are thought to be the result of
binary evolution, and therefore do not follow the single

Figure 8. Comparison of the performance of wdwarfdate
at lower-masses, with the results from Canton et al. (2021).
These white dwarfs belong to the M67 cluster (3.5 Gyr). For
the ﬁnal mass, cooling age and initial mass we show the one-
to-one line in black, and for the total age we show the age
distributions with the age of the cluster in a black line. For
the total age and initial mass we only show the vetted white
dwarfs from Canton et al. (2021). We found good agreement
between our results and their study. The uncertainties in the
initial mass calculated by Canton et al. (2021) are smaller
than the point in some cases because they used a well con-
strained total age to estimate these masses.

star evolution assumption made by the cooling tracks
included in wdwarfdate (B´edard et al. 2020).
In ad-
dition, the color-cut avoids contamination from non-
white dwarfs such as unresolved binaries. For a more
detailed discussion of the limitations of wdwarfdate see
Section 4.

We used wdwarfdate to estimate the ages of the re-
maining 18 white dwarfs. Five of these objects were
identiﬁed as DA white dwarfs in the MWDD, two as
DB, and we assumed DA for the rest, and used the
corresponding Teﬀ and log g from Gentile Fusillo et al.
(2021). Given that most white dwarfs are DAs (∼ 75%),
this is a good assumption (Fontaine et al. 2001; Gen-
tile Fusillo et al. 2015). To run our code we used the
cooling sequence with thick H outermost layer for DA
white dwarfs and with thin layer for non-DA, the stellar
evolution models for [Fe/H] = 0 and v/vcrit = 0.0, and
the Cummings et al. (2018) MIST-based IFMR. We also

masses (0.64+0.16
−0.06 M(cid:12) using the Bayesian method and
0.97+0.23
−0.26 M(cid:12) using the fast-test method). In this case
where the likelihood is not well constrained due to the
uncertainties, the prior in the Bayesian method (in par-
ticular the IMF) is adding extra information preferring
lower-mass white dwarfs, while the fast-test method se-
lects the highest likelihood value. This was discussed in
detailed in Section 2.4, and will be discussed further in
Section 4.

4. LIMITATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS

White dwarf cosmochronology is a powerful tool to
estimate stellar ages. However, it is based on a number
of models and assumptions that need to be taken into
account. In this section, we discuss the constraints and
model choices when using wdwarfdate.

We run a grid of 100 white dwarfs with 1, 500 K <
Teﬀ < 100, 000 K and 7 < log g < 9.3 with diﬀerent rel-
ative uncertainties to test the resulting uncertainty of
the Bayesian total ages derived with wdwarfdate.
In
this study we used the Cummings et al. (2018) MIST-
based IFMR, with the DA white dwarf cooling sequences
and [Fe/H] = 0 and v/vcrit = 0 stellar evolution mod-
els. We found that for uncertainties of 1% in both Teﬀ
and log g, the median relative uncertainty in total age is
∼ 11%, as shown in Figure 10. If the uncertainty of Teﬀ
is increased to 10%, the total age uncertainty increases
to ∼ 25%. On the other hand, using an uncertainty of
1% for Teﬀ and 5% for log g, the total age uncertainty
increases to ∼ 52%, showing the importance of precise
input measurements, in particular of log g. For a study
of the total age relative uncertainty as a function of Teﬀ
and log g see Appendix B. We repeated this analysis for
non-DA cooling models and found no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence in the results.

In addition to the limits on Teﬀ and log g set by
the cooling tracks discussed in Section 2.2, the IFMR
imposes extra limits to the input values for which
wdwarfdate will be able to estimate a total age, main
sequence age and initial mass. To quantify this limit, we
run wdwarfdate on a grid of Teﬀ and log g and recorded
which parameters were estimated. In this exercise, we
adopted the MIST-based Cummings et al. (2018) IFMR,
the cooling sequences for DA white dwarfs, and the stel-
lar evolution models for [Fe/H] = 0 and v/vcrit = 0.0.
The values of Teﬀ and log g for which wdwarfdate can
estimate a total age are color-coded by ﬁnal mass in Fig-
ure 11. In summary, wdwarfdate will derive Bayesian
total ages for 1, 500 K (cid:46) Teﬀ (cid:46) 90, 000 K and 7.9 (cid:46)
log g (cid:46) 9.3, and only ﬁnal mass and cooling age using
the fast-test method for 7.0 (cid:46) log g (cid:46) 7.9 (green-blue
ﬁve point stars in Figure 11).

Figure 9. Color-magnitude diagram for the 30 white dwarf
which are candidate wide co-movers with M dwarfs (Ki-
man et al. 2021). We show as red empty circles the white
dwarfs which were discarded because they are outside the
ranges which are likely to have followed single star evolu-
tion: 0.5 M(cid:12) < mf < 1.1 M(cid:12), and also white dwarfs with
GBP − GRP < 0.9 to avoid contamination from non-single
white dwarfs. The only object within these limits which is
also discarded did not have an estimation of Teﬀ and log g in
Gentile Fusillo et al. (2021). We also show the models of con-
stant mass 0.5 M(cid:12), 0.7 M(cid:12), 0.9 M(cid:12) and 1 M(cid:12) for DA white
dwarfs (Bergeron et al. 1995; Fontaine et al. 2001; Holberg
& Bergeron 2006; Kowalski & Saumon 2006; Bergeron et al.
2011; Tremblay et al. 2011; Blouin et al. 2018).

calculated these white dwarf ages using the Marigo et al.
(2020) IFMR and found similar results, which are not
displayed here. The Gaia source id of the white dwarfs,
the input Teﬀ and log g, and the parameters estimated
with wdwarfdate are in Table 2. The reported values in
this table are the median, 16th, and 84th percentile as
uncertainties. We were able to estimate the total age for
13 of the 18 white dwarfs; the rest have masses outside
of the allowed range by the IFMR. For these 13 white
dwarfs we used both the Bayesian and fast-test methods
included in wdwarfdate, and both results are shown in
the table, while for the remaining 5 we only used the
fast-test method to estimate the ﬁnal mass and cooling
age.

The white dwarfs from Table 2 exemplify the im-
pact of the Teﬀ and log g uncertainties in the estima-
tion of the parameters, and show the advantage of us-
ing the Bayesian method. For example, Gaia EDR3
1323951092358466304 has a 15% and 7% uncertainty on
Teﬀ and log g, respectively. Although the parameters es-
timated for this white dwarf are within the uncertainties
between the fast-test and the Bayesian method, there is
a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between, for example, the ﬁnal

The masses for C/O core white dwarfs ranges from
0.45−1.1 M(cid:12). For lower masses, the core is composed of
He and for higher masses of O and/or Ne (Fontaine et al.
2001; Garcia-berro et al. 1997). As we implemented
cooling tracks that assume a C/O core in wdwarfdate,
parameter estimation using our code outside this range
should be taken with caution. We discuss further the
lower and upper mass limits below.

Within a Hubble time, it is not possible to have a
white dwarf with a mass smaller than 0.45 M(cid:12) that
was formed by single stellar evolution. Low-mass white
dwarfs (< 0.45 M(cid:12)) cannot ignite He, therefore they
have a He core, and are thought to be the result of binary
evolution (e.g., Marsh 1995; Brown et al. 2011). There
are studies which propose that these objects could also
be formed from a red giant branch star which had a high
mass loss rate (e.g., Kilic et al. 2007). In addition, bi-
nary stars could also appear to be white dwarfs of masses

< 0.45 M(cid:12), for example unresolved white dwarf binaries
such as double degenerate stars, look like one single over-
luminous star. With the same Teﬀ , this means bigger ra-
dius, which means smaller mass according to the mass-
radius relation of degenerate objects (Bergeron et al.
2001; B´edard et al. 2017; Kilic et al. 2020). This phe-
nomenon could mimic a white dwarf of mass < 0.45 M(cid:12).
Higher-mass white dwarfs (> 1.1 M(cid:12)) should also be
viewed with caution. These stars are potentially mag-
netic white dwarfs and may have come from a merger
(Ferrario et al. 2015), which would make the single
star evolution assumption fail, and therefore the models
would not reproduce the true evolution of the object.

The typical structure of a white dwarf consists of a
C/O core with a thin shell of He, surrounded by a thin
layer of H. Both the core and the surface layers have an
important role in how the white dwarfs cool: the ther-
mal energy is stored in the core while the heat outﬂow is

ing age of a white dwarf assuming a pure C core is an
upper limit, while assuming a pure O core is a lower
limit, with diﬀerences of a few Gyr for the oldest ob-
jects (Fontaine et al. 2001). Although the core com-
position is still a source of uncertainty for white dwarf
cosmochronology (Simon et al. 2015), it is necessary to
assume one to estimate the cooling age and mass of a
white dwarf with evolutionary models. wdwardate uses
cooling tracks from B´edard et al. (2020) which assume
a C/O core with the same proportions of C and O with
the option of choosing between a thin or thick outermost
H layer.

The parameter estimation using wdwarfdate depends
also on the relation between the progenitor mass and the
white dwarf mass, meaning the IFMR. This is an em-
pirical relation, which is improving as more precise mea-
surements of the parameters of white dwarfs and their
progenitors become available. The IFMRs included in
wdwarfdate are similar to each other (See Figure 3),
and we have seen no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the median
values of the ages and masses estimated in this study
when changing the IFMR. However, the IFMR should
be chosen carefully when using wdwarfdate because the
shape of the posterior PDF can be aﬀected by it. Our
recommendation among the available IFMRs is to use
the MIST-based Cummings et al. (2018) relation, be-
cause this is the most complete and simplest relation to
use with our method. Although Marigo et al. (2020) is
more recent than Cummings et al. (2018), the diﬀerence
is small between the relations, and the kink in the for-
mer complicates the sampling of the posterior without
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the median mass or age of the
white dwarf.

The main sequence age of the progenitor is obtained
from a stellar evolution model, based on its mass, abun-
dances and rotation, which can modify the estimation of
the total age (Moss et al. 2022). We tested the param-
eter estimation for 50 randomly selected white dwarfs
with 1500 K < Teﬀ < 100, 000 K and 7 < log g < 9.3,
with uncertainties of 10% and 1% respectively, using
all the possible combinations of [Fe/H] = {−4, −1, 0.5}
(dex) and v/vcrit = {0.0, 0.4}. For all the runs we used
the MIST-based Cummings et al. (2018) IFMR, and
the cooling sequences for DA white dwarfs. We com-
pared the results to the parameters estimated using
[Fe/H] = 0, and v/vcrit = 0.0 to estimate the eﬀect
of using diﬀerent stellar evolution models. We found no
signiﬁcant change in the estimated values of the ﬁnal
mass or cooling age, which is expected because we did
not modify the parameters of the white dwarf. For the
initial mass we found a small diﬀerence of up to 0.16 M(cid:12)
when [Fe/H] = −4 for both cases of v/vcrit. For the

main sequence age and total age we found diﬀerences of
up to 0.7 Gyr when [Fe/H] = −4, again not changing sig-
niﬁcantly with v/vcrit. This shows that the parameters
of the progenitor star need to be chosen carefully given
that they can aﬀect the results. In case there is no in-
formation of the parameters of the progenitor star, it is
reasonable to choose solar metallicity ([Fe/H] = 0), tak-
ing into account the possible variations described above.
The last aspect to take into account when running
wdwarfdate is the choice of priors. Currently the code
assumes a constant SFH and the IMF to be m−2.3
when
using the Bayesian mode (see Section 2.3), and it does
not allow changes in these priors. As discussed in Sec-
tions 2.4 and 3.3, when the uncertainty in the input pa-
rameters is large, the likelihood will be less constrained
and the priors will have a bigger eﬀect, making the
initial and the ﬁnal masses smaller, and therefore af-

user could consider running the fast-test method instead
of the Bayesian method.
In this alternative method,
wdwarfdate will perform a Monte Carlo uncertainty
propagation to estimate the white dwarf parameters (as
it was described in Section 2.4) and will not be aﬀected
by the priors.

5. SUMMARY

In this work we presented wdwarfdate, a publicly
available Python package which derives Bayesian total
ages of white dwarfs from an eﬀective temperature (Teﬀ )
and a surface gravity (log g), assuming single star evolu-
tion. wdwarfdate obtains the probability distributions
by explicitly integrating over the likelihood and priors
to perform the normalization for the following param-
eters: mass of the progenitor star, cooling age of the
white dwarf and ∆m, which models the scatter in the
IFMR. From these parameters, the code obtains prob-
ability distributions for the mass of the white dwarf,
the main sequence age of the progenitor and the total
age. The derived ages depend on the input parameters
and on the models chosen when initializing wdwarfdate,
which are summarize in Table 1 (See Appendix A for an
example on how to use wdwarfdate).

We tested wdwarfdate on white dwarfs cluster mem-
bers from Cummings et al. (2018) and Canton et al.
(2021).
In general we found good agreement between
our results and theirs for the mass and age of the white
dwarf as well as the properties of the progenitor star. In
addition, we used wdwarfdate to estimate the ages of
a set of 18 white dwarfs which are candidate co-movers
with M dwarfs (Kiman et al. 2021), and therefore con-
form a group of low-mass star age-calibrators.

We also described a detailed analysis of the constraints
on the code which need to be taken into account before
using. In summary:

• We found a typical uncertainty of 10% on the
Bayesian total age for Teﬀ and log g with uncer-
tainties of 1%, and of 25% with input uncertainties
of 10% and 1% for Teﬀ and log g, respectively.

• Combining the limitation of the cooling tracks
with the restrictions of the IFMR, the values for
which wdwarfdate can derive Bayesian total ages
are 1, 500 K (cid:46) Teﬀ (cid:46) 90, 000 K and 7.9 (cid:46) log g (cid:46)
9.3 (cm s−2).

• Given that the cooling tracks assume single star
evolution and C/O core for the white dwarfs, the
best range of ﬁnal masses to use wdwarfdate is
0.45 − 1.1 M(cid:12), because objects outside this range
are not likely to have evolved as a single star.

• The IFMRs included in our code are similar to
each other and the results are not modiﬁed signif-
icantly from using one over the other. However
we recommend using the MIST-based Cummings
et al. (2018) IFMR, given it is one of the most com-
plete studies of white dwarfs in clusters currently
available, and has a relatively simple functional
form.

• The choice of [Fe/H] can modify the main sequence
age and total age by up to 0.7 Gyr, but if there is
no information about the progenitor star available,
solar metallicity ([Fe/H] = 0) is a reasonable as-
sumption.

• When the uncertainty of the input parameters is
large, the prior in the Bayesian method will aﬀect
the estimation of the age given that the likelihood
is not well constrained. The user can consider us-
ing the fast-test method in these cases.

Although Gaia has increased the number of known
white dwarfs by a factor of 10, we still need more white
dwarfs which belong to known clusters with spectra to
improve the calibration of the IFMR. This relation is
one of the main limitations when estimating the total
age of a white dwarf because the complete functional
form of the IFMR is still not known with great accuracy,
especially in the low-mass regime.

In future work we plan to include the estimation of Teﬀ
and log g from photometry in wdwarfdate, and extra
priors in case the ﬁnal mass or total age of the white
dwarf are known, to improve the estimation of the other
parameters.

A. RUNNING WDWARFDATE

Below we include an example of how to run wdwarfdate, where we selected a white dwarf from Cummings et al.
(2018), and we are using the cooling tracks for a DA white dwarf, the stellar evolution track corresponding to [Fe/H]
= 0 and no rotation, and the MIST-based IFMR from Cummings et al. (2018). By default wdwarfdate will run the
Bayesian method, but the fast-test method can be selected by indicating method=’fast test’ in the WhiteDwarf
class. The object results is an astropy Table6 with the total age of the object, main sequence age and mass of the
progenitor and cooling age and mass of the white dwarf, and their uncertainties. This example takes 21 seconds to
run in a personal computer. For more information on how to run wdwarfdate see the documentation of the code.

B. RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY IN TOTAL AGE.

To study the relative uncertainty in the Bayesian total age estimated with wdwarfdate we run a grid of 100 white
dwarfs with 1, 500 K < Teﬀ < 100, 000 K and 7 < log g < 9.3, with diﬀerent uncertainties. In this study we used the
Cummings et al. (2018) MIST-based IFMR, with the DA white dwarf cooling sequences and [Fe/H] = 0 and v/vcrit = 0
stellar evolution models. In Figure 12 we show the relative uncertainty in the total age (ttot) for four cases of input
uncertainties: ∆Teﬀ /Teﬀ = 1% and ∆ log g/ log g = 1%, ∆Teﬀ /Teﬀ = 10% and ∆ log g/ log g = 1%, ∆Teﬀ /Teﬀ = 1%
and ∆ log g/ log g = 5%, and ∆Teﬀ /Teﬀ = 10% and ∆ log g/ log g = 5%. As discussed in Section 4, the biggest eﬀect
on the uncertainty of ttot comes from increasing the uncertainty of log g. In addition, we show that higher Teﬀ are
the most aﬀected by the increase in the uncertainty of the input parameters. We repeated this analysis for non-DA
cooling models and found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence.

uncertainties to show the variation as a function of Teﬀ and log g.
