ABSTRACT
The kinematic plane of stars near the Sun has proven an indispensable tool for untangling the complexities of the structure of
our Milky Way (MW). With ever improving data, numerous kinematic “moving groups” of stars have been better characterized
and new ones continue to be discovered. Here we present an improved method for detecting these groups using MGwave, a new
open-source 2D wavelet transformation code that we have developed. Our code implements similar techniques to previous wavelet
software; however, we include a more robust signiﬁcance methodology and also allow for the investigation of underdensities
which can eventually provide further information about the MW’s non-axisymmetric features. Applying MGwave to the latest
data release from Gaia (DR3), we detect 45 groups of stars with coherent velocities. We reproduce the majority of the previously
detected moving groups in addition to identifying four additional signiﬁcant candidates: one near Antoja12-GCSIII-13, one near
GMG 5, and two with very low 𝑉𝑟 and similar 𝑉𝜙 to Hercules. Finally, we have followed these associations of stars beyond the
solar neighborhood, from Galactocentric radius of 6.5 to 10 kpc. Most detected groups are extended throughout radius indicating
that they are streams of stars possibly due to non-axisymmetric features of the MW.

1 INTRODUCTION

Even a relatively small region of the Milky Way (MW) around our
Sun contains a wealth of information about the larger properties and
non-axisymmetric features of our Galaxy. By studying the motion
of nearby stars we can begin to untangle the many complex com-
ponents of the gravitational potential of the MW including the bar
and spiral arms. We have also seen evidence that the stellar disc is
out of equilibrium with the discovery of local vertical features like
the Radcliﬀe Wave (Alves et al. 2020) and a more extended verti-
cal kinematic wave (Thulasidharan et al. 2021). Since the Hipparcos
mission, scientists have slowly been uncovering more and more de-
tail in the kinematic grouping of stars in the solar neighborhood
(“moving groups”; Eggen 1996; Dehnen 1998; Ramos et al. 2018).
The intricacies of the azimuthal velocity (𝑉; 𝑉𝜙) vs radial velocity
(𝑈; 𝑉𝑟 ) distribution of nearby stars shows that the MW is anything
but a smooth galactic disk in dynamical equilibrium (Dehnen 1998;
Antoja et al. 2018). By studying the origin of these substructures
with the advent of Gaia and, at the same time, utilizing various the-
oretical approaches (Quillen et al. 2011; Fujii et al. 2019; Monari
et al. 2019; D’Onghia & L. Aguerri 2020; Trick et al. 2021; Craig
et al. 2021), we can gain insights on the various components of the
MW and understand better galactic structure and evolution.

One of the least well-constrained features of the MW is its bar.
This non-axisymmetric feature can have a signiﬁcant gravitational
potential and can aﬀect the distribution of stars through resonances.
Depending on the length and pattern speed of the bar, it could provide
diﬀerent explanations for many of the moving groups that we see
in the solar neighborhood (SN). For example, previous models of
the MW included a short bar with a pattern speed of ∼55 km s−1
kpc−1where the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) coincided with the
SN (Dehnen 2000; Debattista et al. 2002; Monari et al. 2017). The

OLR creates a bimodality in the kinematic plane of stars around
the sun providing one possible explanation for the Hercules group.
However, recent observations before Gaia DR3 already suggest that
the bar is actually long and rotating more slowly (∼40 km s−1 kpc−1;
Clarke et al. 2019; Sanders et al. 2019). Theoretical models and
simulations have shown that Hercules could be formed by stars at
the corotation resonance of a long bar (Pérez-Villegas et al. 2017;
D’Onghia & L. Aguerri 2020; Asano et al. 2020). Furthermore,
several of the signiﬁcant moving groups in the solar neighborhood are
explained by being in resonance with the long bar (the Outer Lindblad
resonance (2:1), the 4:1 or the Outer Ultra-Harmonic resonance, and
the 6:1 correspond to the Hat, Sirius, and the Horn, respectively;
Monari et al. 2019). The MW’s spiral arms have also been shown to
have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the kinematics of the SN (e.g. Antoja et al.
2009; Hunt et al. 2018; Michtchenko et al. 2018; Barros et al. 2020).
While looking at the resonances in the solar neighborhood alone are
not suﬃcient to break the degeneracy to discriminate between the
long and short bar scenarios (Trick et al. 2021; Trick 2022), Gaia
DR3 provided the data to observe the bar in the azimuthal velocity
ﬁeld of the galaxy and indicate that the pattern speed is between
38-42 km/s/kpc (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022b).

Gaia constitutes the largest and most precise database of positions
and velocities of stars in the MW to date, which makes it perfect for
this exploration (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016). Its latest release
(Data Release 3; DR3; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022a) provides
improved astrometry and errors for 1.4 billion stars based on 34
months of data. For this study, we include approximately 34 million
stars centered on the Sun for which Gaia provides positions, proper
motions, parallaxes, and radial velocities.

While much of the structure in the 𝑉𝑟 − 𝑉𝜙 kinematic diagram is
clearly visible as overdensities (e.g. Figure 1a), more sophisticated
methods are required to quantify the wealth of information. One

such technique is the wavelet transformation. Much like a Fourier
transformation, the wavelet transform (WT) decomposes data into
diﬀerent components based on a given scale (see Starck et al. 1998,
and references therein). When applied to 2D images, the WT can iso-
late visual structures of diﬀerent sizes. This technique has been used
on a variety of astrophysical data where it allows for the detection
of subtle variations from uniformity, e.g. cosmological large-scale
structure (Slezak et al. 1993; Einasto et al. 2011), galaxy cluster
distributions (Girardi et al. 1997; Da Rocha & Mendes de Oliveira
2005; Da Rocha et al. 2008), and the cosmic microwave background
(Sanz et al. 1999; Rogers et al. 2016; Hergt et al. 2017).

Recent work has also utilized the WT to explore the kinematic
space of the MW (Antoja et al. 2008; Kushniruk et al. 2017; Ramos
et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2021; Bernet et al. 2022). Ramos et al.
(2018) (hereafter R18) used Gaia DR2 and the WT to detect moving
groups in the 𝑉𝑟 −𝑉𝜙 plane and found many arch features covering the
majority of previously known moving groups. In addition to detecting
28 new overdensities, they traced 𝑉𝜙 of the groups over radius and
azimuth to compare with the detected ridges in 𝑉𝜙 − 𝑅 space (Antoja
et al. 2018). The outcome showed that there are kinematic features
indicative of both phase mixing processes as well as resonant trapping
due to the MW’s non-axisymmetric structures.

Similarly, Bernet et al. (2022) explored a larger region of the MW
disk using Gaia eDR3 and the WT combined with a breadth-ﬁrst
search to group detected overdensities together in (𝑅, 𝜙, 𝑍, 𝑉𝑅, 𝑉𝜙)
space. The WT they use is one-dimensional and was speciﬁcally
designed to detect and group overdensities into the arches found in
R18. They again explore the variation in 𝑉𝜙 vs 𝑅 for each detected
group in addition to looking at the distribution of 𝑉𝜙 along 𝜙 and 𝑧.
By comparing with both slow- and fast-bar models, they ﬁnd several
resonances that overlap with the detected groups/arches, however
Gaia eDR3 was not extended enough to determine the bar’s length
and pattern speed in order to remove the degeneracy.

For this work, we have developed an open-source WT code for

MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2022)

use in Python, MGwave1. The code is based on the á trous algorithm
(Starck & Murtagh 1994; Starck et al. 1998) and is able to perform
the wavelet transformation on any 2D image and output the resultant
wavelet coeﬃcients, locations of the extrema, as well as a signiﬁ-
cance, or conﬁdence level for each extremum (when compared to
values resulting from Poisson noise). We build on previous works by
using our MGwave code to analyze the SN as seen by Gaia DR3.
By performing the full 2D WT, we not only detect new kinematic
moving groups, but we are also able to track their extension in the
kinematic plane and their location through Galactocentric radius.
By identifying moving groups of stars that are extended across the
Galactic disk, we can distinguish the large-scale substructures with
a dynamical origin (e.g. those stars that might be in resonance with
the bar or spiral arms) from local, transient features.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines our data
sample and WT methods, Section 3 shows the main results, Section
4 discusses the implications of our results within the context of
previous works, and conclusions are summarized in Section 5.

2 METHODS

2.1 Gaia Data Sample

We selected from the approximately 34 million stars that have posi-
tions, proper motions, parallaxes, and radial velocities in Gaia DR3.
We required “good” parallaxes with errors less than 20% (𝜔/𝜎𝜔 > 5)
and inverted the parallax values to determine the distances to each
star. We transformed the six-dimensional Gaia observables to Galac-
tocentric cylindrical coordinates with the sun located at 𝜙 (cid:12) = 0◦,
𝑍 (cid:12) = 5.5 pc, and 𝑅 (cid:12) = 8.15 kpc. We take the peculiar motion of
the sun with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) in cartesian

Figure 2. Panels a and b show the continuous B3-spline scaling function, 𝜙 ( 𝑥), and the corresponding wavelet function, 𝜓 ( 𝑥), respectively. Panels c−e show
the discrete wavelet function (generated from the ﬁlters ℎ and 𝑔) for scales 𝑗 = 0, 𝑗 = 1, and 𝑗 = 2. Panels f−h show the resulting wavelet transform of the
image of M51 shown in panel i.3 The original image is 720 pixels wide by 1037 pixels high and the scales shown in panels f, g, and h are 𝑗 = 2, 𝑗 = 4, and
𝑗 = 5 resulting in the detection of features with sizes of 4-8 pixels, 16-32 pixels, and 32-64 pixels respectively.

coordinates as (𝑈, 𝑉, 𝑊) = (10.6, 10.7, 7.6) km s−1 and the circular
velocity of the sun as 𝑉𝑐 = 236 km 𝑠−1 (Reid et al. 2019). 𝑉𝑟 is
directed out away from the Galactic center and 𝑉𝜙 is directed against
the direction of rotation of the disk (i.e. 𝜙 decreases in the direction
of rotation, towards the major axis of the MW bar, and increases
counter to the rotation, towards the minor axis of the MW bar).

Errors on the Gaia data were propagated through to Galactocentric
cylindrical coordinates through the use of Monte Carlo simulations.
We used the pyia code (Price-Whelan 2018) to run 256 error sam-
ples that were transformed using the above process. By taking the
standard deviation of the transformed coordinate values, we obtained
an estimate of the error in the Galactocentric coordinates and veloci-
ties for each star. This method does account for correlations between
right ascention, declination, parallax, and proper motion, but does
not include correlations for radial velocity.

There are 29,947,046 stars with radial velocities and 𝜔/𝜎𝜔 > 5
in Gaia DR3. This is increased by more than a factor of four over
eDR3. We deﬁne the “solar neighborhood” region as |𝑧| < 0.5 kpc,
−1.5◦ < 𝜙 < 1.5◦, and 8.05 < 𝑅 < 8.25 kpc which contains
982,879 stars. We have also explored additional volumes throughout
the Galactic disk by looking at 70 overlapping radial bins of width
0.2 kpc in the range 𝑅 = (6.4, 10.1) kpc while maintaining the
constraints on 𝑧 and 𝜙, speciﬁcally (6.4, 6.6) kpc, (6.45, 6.65) kpc,
(6.5, 6.7) kpc, etc. However, we do see a decrease in the number of
stars per bin as we reach the limits of this range.

In order to compare with previous works, we have also per-
formed the same analysis with Gaia’s Data Release 2 (DR2).
We have followed the same procedure as above however we have
used the deﬁnition of Galactocentric cylindrical coordinates as
deﬁned in R18 (𝑍 (cid:12) = 14 pc, 𝑅 (cid:12) = 8.34 kpc, (𝑈, 𝑉, 𝑊) =
(11.1, 12.24, 7.25) km s−1, and 𝑉𝑐 = 240 km 𝑠−1 from Schönrich
et al. 2010 and Reid et al. 2014). We have also required “good” paral-
lax values, i.e. 𝜔/𝜎𝜔 > 5 and distances were calculated by inverting
the parallax. This provided us with an identical data set to that of

R18. A comparison of our results between DR2 and DR3 is shown
in Figure 1.

2.2 Wavelet Transform Method

Our open-source WT code, MGwave, is based on the á trous algo-
rithm (Starck & Murtagh 1994; Starck et al. 1998). We have also
implemented quantitative analysis to determine the signiﬁcance of
detected structures with respect to Poisson noise (Slezak et al. 1993).
Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are used to propagate data errors
through to the wavelet results.

Our implementation of the á trous algorithm utilizes the Starlet
transformation with a B3-spline scaling function (Starck & Murtagh
2006),

Figures 2a and b shows the continuous scaling function and cor-
responding wavelet function. Since we are working with pixellated
images, we need to discretize these functions. Deﬁned in terms of
the ℎ and 𝑔 ﬁlter set (Starck et al. 1998), the scaling function corre-

from 𝑔 = 𝛿 − ℎ = [− 1
]. These discrete wavelet

functions are shown in Figure 2c−e for three diﬀerent scales ( 𝑗 = 0,
𝑗 = 1, and 𝑗 = 2). By applying this separable convolution mask to our
image in each dimension sequentially, we obtain the wavelet trans-
formed image (consisting of the values of the wavelet coeﬃcients for
each pixel). An example image and its wavelet transforms at three
diﬀerent scales ( 𝑗 = 2, 𝑗 = 4, and 𝑗 = 5) are shown in Figure 2f−i.
When performing the wavelet transformation at small scales (panel
f), the smallest structures in the original image are selected. As we
increase the scale of the transformation, larger and larger features are
shown. For a more detailed discussion see Starck et al. (1998).

We then use a peak detection algorithm to ﬁnd local minima

and maxima in the wavelet transformed image. We require that de-
tected extrema are separated by at least the wavelet scale size (2 𝑗 ).
This is accomplished using the peak_local_max function in the
scikit-image package (van der Walt et al. 2014). We then ensure
that if there are two peaks or two troughs within 2 𝑗 pixels, we only
keep the extremum with the larger wavelet coeﬃcient. Once we have
located the extrema, we then calculate the signiﬁcance of each peak
and trough to determine whether or not it could be an artifact of
Poisson noise.

2.3 Signiﬁcance of Detected Extrema

Given a wavelet coeﬃcient, its signiﬁcance must be computed to
assess the probability that the detected extremum is “real”. This will
give us a conﬁdence level that the value of a wavelet coeﬃcient
(pixel in the transformed image) is not due to random Poisson noise.
In order to calculate this, we can integrate the WT probability density
function, 𝑝𝑛 (𝑤), to determine the likelihood that a random wavelet
coeﬃcient due to Poisson noise has a lower value than a wavelet
coeﬃcient of value 𝑤 (Slezak et al. 1993; i.e. larger values of 𝐹 (𝑤)
mean 𝑤 is more signiﬁcant):

𝐹 (𝑤) =

∫ 𝑤

−∞

𝑝𝑛 (𝑥) 𝑑𝑥

(2)

The probability density function depends on both the speciﬁc
wavelet function chosen (in its continuous form, e.g. Figure 2b),
and also on the number of events used to determine the wavelet coef-
ﬁcient. As stated above, we use a B3-spline as the scaling function, 𝜙
(Equation 1). At each wavelet scale, 𝑗, we dilate the scaling function
by a factor of 2 𝑗 and then renormalize it such that
∫ ∞

−∞
We then compute the continuous wavelet function (in 2D), 𝜓(𝑥, 𝑦),
by looking at the diﬀerence between the scaling functions at two
successive scales (Starck et al. 1998).

The number of events also aﬀects the probability density function.
In the case of a 2D histogram (for example, the 𝑉𝑟 − 𝑉𝜙 kinematic
plane used later in this paper), the number of events represents the
total number of stars within the bins used in calculating the wavelet
coeﬃcient. If there is only one event, the probability to get any given
wavelet coeﬃcient is represented by the histogram of the wavelet
function, 𝐻1. For two events, each has the probability represented by
the histogram of the wavelet function and since they are independent
of each other, we can take the autoconvolution of the histogram to
represent the PDF for two events (Slezak et al. 1993). Therefore for
𝑛 events, the PDF is 𝑛 − 1 autoconvolutions of the PDF for a single
event.

𝑝𝑛 (𝑥) = 𝐻1 ∗ 𝐻1 ∗ · · · ∗ 𝐻1

(5)

We compute the histogram of the wavelet function using the ker-
nel density estimator (kdeplot) from the seaborn python package
(Waskom 2021). As described in Slezak et al. (1993), a maximum
must have 𝑛 ≥ 3 and a minimum must have 𝑛 ≥ 4 in order for the
signiﬁcance calculation above to be valid.

Therefore, 𝐹 (𝑤) (Equation 2) can be used to determine the con-
ﬁdence level of each extremum via thresholding. We followed the

method in R18 setting conﬁdence levels based on these signiﬁcance
values:
0 : 𝐹 (𝑤) < 𝜖1𝜎
1 : 𝜖1𝜎 ≤ 𝐹 (𝑤) < 𝜖2𝜎
2 : 𝜖2𝜎 ≤ 𝐹 (𝑤) < 𝜖3𝜎
3 : 𝐹 (𝑤) ≥ 𝜖3𝜎
where 𝜖𝑛𝜎 corresponds to the integral of the normal distribution,
𝑁 (0, 1), from −∞ to 𝑛. This gives 𝜖1𝜎 ≈ 0.841, 𝜖2𝜎 ≈ 0.977, and
𝜖3𝜎 ≈ 0.999.

(6)

Following previous works (R18), we consider any extremum to be

signiﬁcant if it has a conﬁdence level ≥ 2.

2.4 Monte Carlo Simulations

To account for underlying uncertainty in the data, we use Monte
Carlo simulations to propagate errors through the WT. Uncertainty
values can be supplied for the 𝑥 and 𝑦 coordinates for each object (i.e.
the data used to create the histogram on which the WT is performed)
and MGwave will simulate new data by pulling random values from
gaussian distributions. After running this simulation process many
times and performing the WT on each new data set, the code then
calculates the number of simulations in which a peak is detected
within a circle of diameter 2 𝑗 (the scale of the WT) around the actual
peak. The workﬂow is as follows:

1. Obtain new 𝑥 and 𝑦 values for each object by sampling a gaus-

sian distribution with the associated errors.

2. Run the wavelet routine on the new, simulated data obtaining a

list of maxima and minima.

3. For each extremum in the original data, check if there exists an

extremum in the simulated data within a circle of diameter of 2 𝑗 .

4. Repeat 𝑁 times.

For the work presented in this Article, we supplied uncertainties
in 𝑉𝑟 and 𝑉𝜙 propagated from the Gaia data individually for each
star (see Section 2.1) and performed 𝑁 = 2,000 iterations. Following
previous works (R18), we consider any extremum to be independent
of Gaia errors if it is reproduced in > 80% of the Monte Carlo
simulations, i.e. 𝑃MC > 0.8. These values are listed in Table 1.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Detected Moving Groups in the Solar Neighborhood

By utilizing Gaia DR3, combined with our wavelet code, we are able
to detect 45 moving groups listed in Table 1. Figure 1 shows the 2D
histogram (Panel a) as well as the resultant wavelet coeﬃcients and
extrema (Panel b). The purple and green shaded regions in Figure 1b
show the positive and negative wavelet coeﬃcients, respectively,
with the red and blue crosses marking the locations of the maxima
and minima, respectively. While our results for DR3 are in general
very consistent with DR2 (shown in Figure 1c), the most signiﬁcant
diﬀerences arise from the restriction on the minimum number of
stars for a detected maximum. As discussed above, at least 3 stars
are required for relative maxima, and 4 stars are required for relative
minima in order for consistent signiﬁcance determination. This cutoﬀ
was not implemented in previous works, and for easier comparison
with R18, it is disabled in our analysis of the DR2 data below.

We are able to detect 16 candidate overdensities in addition to
ﬁnding 4 previously detected groups that were not detected in R18:

Table 1. Moving groups detected using our new wavelet transform on Gaia DR3 data. The same naming convention as R18 is followed (see their Appendix C
for more information). Groups marked with an asterisk (*) are those that have been previously discovered but were not present in the wavelet analysis of R18.
Bold lines are groups newly discovered in this work. Columns 5-8 list the output of our analysis: CL denotes the conﬁdence level that a given group is not due
to Poisson noise (see Section 2.3); 𝑃MC gives the percentage of Monte Carlo simulations in which the peak appeared when varying the stellar velocities within
Gaia errors (see Section 2.4); Wavelet gives the magnitude of the wavelet coeﬃcient at the peak; Stars lists the number of stars in a region of kinematic space
around the peak corresponding to the scale of the wavelet transformation performed (in this case within a circle of radius 16 km s−1).

Our 16 candidate groups are numbered with a “DR3G” (Data Release
3 Group) preﬁx in Table 1. Of our 16 candidate groups discovered, 7
meet the conﬁdence level criteria (CL ≥ 2), 7 meet the Monte Carlo
criteria (𝑃MC > 0.8), and 4 groups meet both criteria (Groups 21,
26, 33, and 34 in Table 1). Group 21 is near Antoja12-GCSIII-13
(Antoja et al. 2012) and could indicate further substructure in this
region, Group 26 is near the GMG 5 (R18), and Groups 33 and 34 are
in a region without previous detections at very low 𝑉𝑟 with similar
𝑉𝜙 to Hercules. These groups are circled in Figure 1a and b.

To compare our wavelet method with previous works, we have
reproduced the steps of R18. Following their selection of Gaia DR2
data, our code is able to detect all of the top 24 groups listed in their
Table 3. We also ﬁnd 11 of the remaining 20 groups (all of which were
new detections not matching any previously known moving group).
In addition to the groups found in R18, our wavelet code detects six
previously identiﬁed groups: Kushniruk17-J5-2, Kushniruk17-J4-19
(Kushniruk et al. 2017), Dehnen98-11 (Dehnen 1998), HR1614,
Antoja12-19, and Antoja12-15 (Antoja et al. 2012).

There are also 33 detected overdensities that don’t overlap with

any of the groups listed in Table 3 or C.1 in R18, however only 3
of these meet the conﬁdence level and Monte Carlo criteria (Groups
30, 39, and 49 in Table 1). Groups 39 and 49 use fewer than 3 stars
to calculate the wavelet coeﬃcient which is below our cutoﬀ in the
DR3 data. Group 30 is detected in the DR3 data as well (Group 30 in
Table 1) however it has shifted slightly and its conﬁdence level has
reduced to 0.

3.2 Moving Groups Across the Disk

One of the most valuable aspects of automated WTs is the ability
to quickly and easily detect overdensities and underdensities for an
arbitrary dataset. We have used this to analyze diﬀerent bins of Gaia
DR3 data to track moving groups throughout Galactocentric radius.
We selected 70 radial bins centered on 𝑅 ranging from 6.5 to 10 kpc
with a bin size of 0.2 kpc.

For each bin, we run the WT and determine the locations and
signiﬁcance of each overdensity. By plotting each detected peak on
the kinematic plane, we can track the evolution of the moving groups
throughout the Galactic disk. This is shown in Figure 3 (some extra-
neous detections not associated with a continuous stream have been
removed). Each dot is a detected peak colored by its Galactocentric
radius. The moving groups in the SN are shown as square markers
and are labelled. Here we can clearly see that many of the detected
moving groups extend (cid:38)1 kpc radially throughout the Galactic disk.
The tracked groups with their radial extents are listed in Table 2.
We also note that there are ﬁve groups with very limited radial ex-
tent (< 0.5 kpc): Coma Berenices, HR1614, Pleiades, Boblyev16-23,
and a previously uncharacterized group (Group 21). A discussion of
the diﬀerences between these and the radially extended groups is
included in Section 4.

3.2.1 Shapes of Moving Groups in the Kinematic Plane

In addition to simply detecting the peaks of overdensities, the WT
evaluates the wavelet coeﬃcients across the entire image (shown as
green and purple shaded regions in Figure 1b and c). We can then
look at the shape of the moving groups in kinematic space by plotting

column lists the ID corresponding to the groups in Table 1. Note that we
found that Sirius extends to the maximum radius of 10 kpc, so it could extend
further outwards.

contours of constant wavelet coeﬃcient. We have also performed this
analysis as a function of radius and the results are shown in Figure 4.
Note that while the contour levels are consistent across radius within
a single group (e.g. all contours for the Hercules group are 10% of
the maximum wavelet coeﬃcient at each radius), the contour levels
vary from group to group (e.g. the contours for Sirius are at the 40%
level whereas the contours for Hyades are at the 90% level). This
allows for optimum visualization of groups with diﬀerent wavelet
coeﬃcient values, however this means that the relative size between
groups in this ﬁgure does not have meaning. The main purpose of this
ﬁgure is to show how the kinematics of individual groups changes
with radius.

For example, as we progress towards the Galactic center, we can
see that Hercules covers a larger portion of the kinematic plane.
Therefore, at smaller radii, the percentage of stars in the Hercules
stream increases. Converesely, as we progress towards the outer disk,
Hercules tends to disappear. We see a similar but inverse trend with
Sirius. At smaller Galactocentric radii, the contours around Sirius
shrink and eventually vanish, but as we progress past the SN and
beyond into the outer disk, Sirius grows to cover a signiﬁcant portion
of the kinematic plane.

4 DISCUSSION

Our WT code, MGwave, performs 2D wavelet transformations with
the goal of detecting statistically signiﬁcant circular overdensities and
underdensities at varying scales. This is distinct from many recent
WT analyses of the SN kinematic plane. R18 don’t include a mini-
mum star count cutoﬀ and thus detect many more fringe overdensi-
ties that we consider not signiﬁcant against Poisson noise. Yang et al.
(2021) use a bivariate WT to detect features in the 𝑉 vs
𝑈2 + 2𝑉 2
space and they utilize a Gaussian mixture model with Monte Carlo
sampling to generate a smooth background distribution to compare
against. Bernet et al. (2022) explore the 𝑉𝑟 −𝑉𝜙 plane by performing
a one-dimensional WT on slices in 𝑉𝑟 . By linking peaks in the 1D

and are signiﬁcantly still prominent across the Galactocentric radius.
Moreover, Figure 4 shows Sirius becoming more prominent at larger
radii (opposite of Hercules). For a bar with a pattern speed of ∼40
km s−1 kpc−1, the location of the OUH is at 8.5-9 kpc (D’Onghia &
L. Aguerri 2020). Therefore, we expect more stars comprising Sirius
as we look towards the outer Galactic disk, which is shown in the
data.

There are several other groups that we detect with signiﬁcant
radial extent, many of which are also identiﬁed being in resonance
with the bar (Monari et al. 2019). Antoja12-16, Antoja12-GCSIII-
13, 𝛾Leo, new group DR3G-21, and possibly Antoja12-12 fall on the
OUH resonance along with Sirius. Dehnen98-6 aligns well with the
6:1 resonance along with the Horn. Finally, 𝜖Ind and Hercules and
Liang17-9 are all at corotation.

This leaves four groups with radial extent greater than 0.5 kpc
unaccounted for: the Hyades, GMG 1, GMG 3, and Kushniruk17-J4-
19. While Hyades doesn’t seem to have formed through any known
bar resonance, works focusing on the kinematic signatures of spiral
arm resonances have been able to reproduce Hyades along with
several other features of the SN kinematic plane (Michtchenko et al.
2018; Barros et al. 2020; including low 𝑉𝜙 features like GMG 1,3, and
Kushniruk17-J4-19). However, these models predict that the moving
groups are signiﬁcantly extended in 𝜙, and less extended in 𝑅. Further
work will be required to constrain the groups in 𝜙 to test this theory.
Additionally, our detection of Hyades throughout a large range of
Galactocentric radii could be simply the detection of the main mode
in each neighborhood. We expect a smooth evolution of 𝑉𝜙 across
radius with stars being mostly on circular orbits. Therefore, while
the main mode might be identiﬁed as Hyades locally, at diﬀerent
radii, the detected peak could simply be the bulk motion of the disk.
This would also explain why it is unique in its double slope in 𝑉𝑟 in
Figure 1 (discussed further below).

There are also ﬁve groups detected that have small radial extent
(< 0.5 kpc): Coma Berenices, the Pleiades, HR1614, Boblyev16-
23, and DR3G-21 (which was brieﬂy discussed above). It has been
shown previously that Coma Berenices and the Pleiades are open
clusters (e.g. Odenkirchen et al. 1998; Tang et al. 2018; Heyl et al.
2022). Figure 3 and Table 2 corroborates this result by showing that
these objects are detected only locally within the SN. While HR1614
has long been considered an open cluster (e.g. Feltzing & Holmberg
2000; De Silva et al. 2007) recent works suggest that its metallicity
spread matches that of the MW disk population (Kushniruk et al.
2020). Further investigation is required to unravel the true origin of
HR1614.

We apply our MGwave code to Gaia DR3. Figure 5 shows the
azimuthal velocity of the known moving groups of the SN displayed
as a function of Galactocentric radius. each moving groups is colored
by radial velocity. Bernet et al. (2022) showed the same plot but using
a 1D WT technique applied to the previous Gaia data release (eDR3).
The authors found that all major groups deviate from the predicted
𝑉𝜙 ∝ 𝑅−1. Note that our results obtained with DR3 seem to conﬁrm
a deviation from the constant angular momentum curve (dashed line)
for most of the known moving groups, with the exception of GMG
1. This general outcome is not surprising as the constant angular
momentum curve is expected for small radial oscillations of the stars,
within the epicycle approximation. Therefore, a deviation is expected
for highly eccentric stars. Additionally, even with the improved data
of Gaia DR3, we are unable to trace our groups much inwards of 𝑅 ∼
7 kpc while Bernet et al. (2022) ﬁnd groups extending down to 5 kpc.
This discrepancy could be due to the diﬀerence in the wavelet method
(searching for arches vs. search for circular features). However it is
also clear that the data become less accurate at these radii. While

Figure 4. As in Fig 3, except each moving group is designated by contours
of constant wavelet coeﬃcient. Note that the axis limits are diﬀerent from
Figure 3. This allows us to see how the shapes of the groups vary as a function
of radius. Note only four groups are displayed here to maintain clarity.

WT with neighboring 𝑉𝑟 bins, they detect arches in the kinematic
plane analogous to those found in R18.

While previous works have analyzed moving groups through ra-
dius (e.g. R18; Antoja et al. 2018; Fragkoudi et al. 2019; Bernet
et al. 2022), they have focused on the variation in the locations of the
peak overdensities (e.g. Figures 3, 5). Our Figure 4 shows that the
WT can provide much richer information than simply the location of
the extrema. The contours of these groups and how they evolve with
radius and azimuth can be informative on the properties of the non-
axisymmetric features of the Galactic disc. Because many of these
groups are so extended in radius, we know that they are not local,
transient structures, but large-scale features of the MW disk. Their
extent indicates that these moving groups are likely formed through
the gravitational eﬀects of the MW’s non-axisymmetric features.

The MW’s bar and spiral arms and their associated resonances
have long been used to explain the origin of moving groups. Recent
works seem to indicate that a long bar with pattern speed of ∼40
km s−1 kpc−1 is consistent with both direct observations (Clarke
et al. 2019; Sanders et al. 2019) and can explain many of the moving
groups that we detect in the SN (Monari et al. 2019; D’Onghia &
L. Aguerri 2020; Trick et al. 2021). D’Onghia & L. Aguerri (2020)
proposed a model with a bar of length 4.5 kpc and pattern speed of
40 km s−1 kpc−1and showed that Hercules is reproduced by stars at
the corotation resonance with the bar. In this scenario Hercules’ stars
are librating around the bar’s Lagrange points L4/L5 thus leading to
a stream of stars with coherent velocity (slower than the sun) in the
SN (see their Figure 4). As shown in our Figures 3 and 4, Hercules
is extended in radius around the SN. Moreover, Figure 4 shows that
Hercules grows to cover a signiﬁcant portion of the kinematic plane
for 𝑅 < 𝑅 (cid:12). In the models of D’Onghia & L. Aguerri (2020), the
bar’s corotation radius is around 6 kpc, so if the stars of Hercules are
formed through trapping at corotation, we would expect Hercules to
become more signiﬁcant at smaller radii, consistent with the data.

The model of a long bar presented in Monari et al. (2019) also
shows that ﬁve regions of in the kinematic plane correspond to reso-
nances with the bar. In addition to Hercules being stars at corotation
with the bar, the authors ﬁnd that the Hat aligns with OLR, Sirius
with the Outer Ultra-Harmonic resonance (OUH), and the Horn with
the 6:1 resonances. All of these groups are shown in our Figure 3

the WT is able to detect signiﬁcant overdensities even at these small
radii, many of them have small 𝑃MC values indicating that they are
not robust detections against the Gaia errors (see Section 2.4).

Our Figure 3 shows that there is also a signiﬁcant variation in 𝑉𝑟
with 𝑅. Notably that most groups have a shift in 𝑉𝑟 as they move in
radius, however the direction of this shift (the slope of the connected
points in Figure 3) can be positive, negative, or both. Four groups
have strong positive slopes (e.g. Liang17-9, Dehnen98-6, the Horn,
and portions of Hercules) in which they move to larger 𝑉𝑟 at higher
radii, and three have strong negative slopes (GMG 3, GMG 1, and
Kushniruk17-J4-19) with smaller 𝑉𝑟 at higher radii. Several other
groups have slight slopes in either direction, or multiple slopes at
diﬀerent radii. Notably, Hyades moves to larger 𝑉𝑟 until it reaches
the solar neighborhood at which point it decreases again, and the
Horn moves to constant 𝑉𝜙 at its innermost extent.

For the positive slope groups, the inner portion (smaller 𝑅) has an
inward velocity relative to the centroid, while the outer portion (larger
𝑅) has an outward velocity. This will inevitably lead to the group
spreading out and possibly breaking apart. Consequently, negative
slope groups exhibit the opposite trend and therefore are condens-
ing. These two diﬀerent behaviors of groups could possibly indicate
environmental eﬀects operating at diﬀerent radii like tidal eﬀects,
but further analysis of the data in comparison with simulations is
required to fully explore the possible causes of these slopes.

Looking at the larger structure of the WT images, previous works
(e.g. Skuljan et al. 1999; Antoja et al. 2008) have noted several
distinct kinematic branches visible in the 𝑉𝑟 − 𝑉𝜙 plane. Antoja
et al. (2008) found that these branches are inclined at an angle
of ∼16◦ and the four most prominent are aligned with the Her-
cules, Hyades/Pleiades, Coma Berenices, and Sirius groups. These
branches are still clearly visible in our data (see Figure 1c), how-
ever thanks to Gaia’s immense volume of data, we can now view

MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2022)

these structures across larger ranges of 𝑉𝑟 . Gaia Collaboration et al.
(2018) and R18 extended these branches into arches, most of which
follow constant kinetic energy. In contrast to the uniformly inclined
branches found in Antoja et al. (2008), Gaia’s increased data has
elongated and straightened out many of these structures. However,
as discussed in R18, several of the arches are still inclined to one
side; notably their A5 and A7 corresponding to Hyades/Pleiades and
Coma Berenices.

In this study we have returned to the method of Antoja et al.
(2008) of summing the wavelet transformed image along 𝑉𝑟 to ob-
tain a histogram as a function of 𝑉𝜙. We have explored this histogram
both with and without the 16◦ rotation that was performed in An-
toja et al. (2008). These results can be seen in Figure 6 (Panels (a)
show the results without rotation and Panels (b) include the 16◦ ro-
tation). With the increased volume of data provided by Gaia, we
can see that, while the Hyades/Pleiades, Coma Berenices, and Sirius
branches do still appear inclined (and we see 𝛾Leo appear in the
rotated histogram as well), there are several other structures that do
not follow this trend. Most dramatically, we see three strong peaks in
the non-rotated histogram corresponding to various components of
Hercules. By looking at the wavelet plane, the horizontal alignment
of these branches is clearly visible, while in the rotated plane (bot-
tom panels) Hercules becomes muddled. We also see slight peaks in
the non-rotated histogram corresponding to the Hat at very high 𝑉𝜙,
and Arcturus at very low 𝑉𝜙. While some of the these tilted features
have been reproduced in past simulations (e.g. Antoja et al. 2009;

determine their source speciﬁcally in the context of a long, slow bar.

10 kpc, we ﬁnd that the majority of the moving groups detected
within the SN are radially extended (Figure 3). The elongation of
these groups indicate that they are dynamical structures possibly
outcome by the eﬀects of resonances of the MW’s non-axisymmetric
features.

• By mapping contours in wavelet space, we can track the varia-
tion in the kinematic shape of these groups through radius (Figure 4).
We ﬁnd Hercules becoming more prominent towards the galactic cen-
ter, in agreement with the models of D’Onghia & L. Aguerri (2020)
predicting that Hercules is comprised of stars at corotation with the
bar.

• Mapping WT contours also reveals an opposite trend for Sirius,
it gets more prominent towards the outer disc. This seems to be
consistent with Sirius being in resonance with the OUH Monari
et al. (2019) located outside the solar radius.

Gaia DR3 has greatly expanded our view of the MW. By looking
at the kinematics of moving groups throughout a signiﬁcant portion
of the disk, we can unravel many of the mysteries of the MW’s
non-axisymmetric features and their associated resonances.

Figure 6. The wavelet plane and its histogram along 𝑉𝜙 for 𝑗 = 3, structures
of size 4-8 km s−1. In the top panels, the wavelet plane is identical to that
shown in Figure 7, however on the bottom panels, the plane has been rotated
by 16◦ counter-clockwise. As done in Antoja et al. (2008), this is to better
align the Hyades-Pleiades, Coma Berenices, and Sirius overdensities with
the 𝑥-axis. However, as shown in the top panel, there are several structures
(Hercules, the Hat, and Arcturus) which do not match this distinctive rotation.
The line plots on the right show the sums of wavelet coeﬃcients across all
𝑉𝑟 as a function of 𝑉𝜙. These panels show that the Hyades-Pleiades, Coma
Berenices, and Sirius overdensities are stronger and more prominent after a
16◦ rotation of the plane, whereas Hercules, the Hat, and Arcturus are stronger
without the rotation.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The wavelet transform is an invaluable tool for precise, quantitative
analysis of images. Our new code, MGwave, is an open-source Python
module for performing wavelet transformations on 2D images while
detecting extrema and determining their signiﬁcance. Additionally,
we have implemented Monte Carlo sampling to propagate errors and
uncertainties through to the wavelet extrema detections. MGwave
is able to reproduce the ﬁndings of R18 (using Gaia DR2 data)
and improves upon previous codes by detecting underdensities in
addition to overdensities and implementing a minimum 𝑛 cutoﬀ in
the signiﬁcance calculation.

We performed the WT on Gaia DR3 data to detect moving groups
in the kinematic plane (𝑉𝑟 −𝑉𝜙) of the solar neighborhood (Figure 1).
With the improved data, we have several main conclusions:

• We have detected four new, statistically signiﬁcant candidate
moving groups: one near Antoja12-GCSIII-13, one near GMG 5,
and two more at very low 𝑉𝑟 with similar 𝑉𝜙 to Hercules.

• We have been able to perform the WT on diﬀerent regions
within the MW disk. Exploring the structure of the kinematic plane
in sections of the disk ranging in Galactocentric radius from 6.5 to

Figure 7. Wavelet coeﬃcient values across the kinematic plane for the solar neighborhood at various wavelet scales using Gaia DR3. Panel (a) corresponds to a
scale of 𝑗 = 2 increasing to a scale of 𝑗 = 5 in Panel (d). Given our bin size of 0.5 km s−1, these correspond to physical sizes of 2 km s−1 up to 32 km s−1 (see
labels in ﬁgure). Contours are shown at the 5% and -0.1% (dashed) level (except for Panel (a)).

Table 1. Moving groups detected using our new wavelet transform on Gaia DR2 data. Compare with those found in R18. Groups marked with an asterisk (*) are
those that have been previously discovered but were not present in the wavelet analysis of R18. Bold lines are groups newly discovered in this work. Columns
5-9 list the output of our analysis: CL denotes the conﬁdence level that a given group is not due to Poisson noise (see Section 2.3); 𝑃MC gives the percentage
of Monte Carlo simulations in which the peak appeared when varying the stellar velocities within Gaia errors (see Section 2.4); Wavelet gives the magnitude of
the wavelet coeﬃcient at the peak; n lists the number of stars used in computing the wavelet coeﬃcient; Stars lists the number of stars in a region of kinematic
space around the peak corresponding to the scale of the wavelet transformation performed (in this case within a circle of radius 16 km s−1).
