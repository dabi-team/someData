Abstract

Sturm’s Theorem is a fundamental 19th century result relating the number of real
roots of a polynomial f in an interval to the number of sign alternations in a sequence
of polynomial division-like calculations. We provide a short direct proof of Sturm’s
Theorem, including the numerically vexing case (ignored in many published accounts)
where an interval endpoint is a root of f .

Introduction

Counting the number of roots of a polynomial in an interval is a fundamental algorithmic
problem in real algebraic geometry, and forms the core of techniques for deeper problems
such as real-solving and the ﬁrst order theory of the reals. On the practical side, numerous
problems from control theory and physical modeling reduce to solving systems of polynomial
equations over the real numbers, and one can not solve a system numerically until one
understands how to count the number of roots in an interval.

We will present, from scratch, a strengthened version of a classical result of Sturm. To

begin, let us review some basic ideas.

Notation Recall that R[x1] is the collection of all polynomials in the variable x1 with real
coeﬃcients. For any f ∈ R[x1] of degree d we then deﬁne its pseudo-remainder sequence
(a.k.a. Sturm sequence) to be Pf := (p0, . . . , pd), where p0 := f , p1 := f ′ (the derivative of f ),
pi := qi+1pi+1 − pi+2 for all i ∈ {0, . . . , d − 2},
and qi+1 and −pi+2 are respectively the quotient and remainder obtained from dividing pi by
pi+1. We also deﬁne Pf (c) := (p0(c), . . . , pd(c)) for any c ∈ R and Vf (c) to be the number of
sign alternations in the sequence Pf (c). In particular, the number of sign alternations in an
arbitrary sequence (s0, . . . , sd) is simply the number of j ∈ {0, . . . , d − 1} such that there is a
k > 0 with sjsj+k < 0 and sℓ = 0 for all ℓ with j < ℓ < j + k. Finally, we let σ : R −→ {−1, 0, 1}
be the sign function, which maps all positive (resp. negative) numbers to 1 (resp. −1) and 0
to 0. We also naturally extend σ to sequences by σ(s) := (σ(s0), . . . , σ(sd)). ⋄

σ(Pf (−2)) = (1, −1, 1), σ(Pf (0)) = (1, 0, −1), and thus Vf (−2) = 2 and Vf (0) = 1. Note also
that −1 is the only root of f in the half-open interval (−2, 1], and that Sturm sequences can
terminate with more than one zero term. ⋄

Recall that a root ζ of f is a multiple (or degenerate) root iﬀ f (ζ) = f ′(ζ) = 0. Roots ζ with
f ′(ζ) 6= 0 are usually called simple or non-degenerate.

Theorem 1.2 (Reﬁned Sturm’s Theorem) For any f ∈ R[x1]\{0} and any real numbers
a and b with a ≤ b, let Nf (a, b] denote the number1 of roots of f in the half-open interval
(a, b].2 Then

1. If neither a nor b are multiple roots, then Nf (a, b] = Vf (a) − Vf (b).
2. If f (c) = f ′(c) = 0 then Vf (c) = 0.

Note in particular that we can count roots in (a, b] even when one or both endpoints are
roots of f — provided no multiple roots occur at either endpoint. Assertion (2), while almost
trivial to prove, is the main reason one needs to avoid multiple roots at end-points when
using Sturm’s Theorem: The information carried by the sign alternations of Pf (c) is lost
entirely when c is a multiple root.

Example 1.3 It is easily checked that the roots of f (x1) := x3
{2, 3}, with 2 a multiple root and 1 a simple root, and that

1 − 5x2

1 + 7x1 − 3 are precisely

Pf (x1) = (cid:0)x3

1 − 5x2

1 + 7x1 − 3, 3x2

1 − 10x1 + 7, 8

9, 0(cid:1).

Clearly then, Vf (1) = 0, Vf (2) = 1, and Vf (3) = 0, so Sturm’s Theorem is conﬁrmed for the
interval (2, 3]. However, we also see that Sturm’s Theorem can not be applied to the interval
(1, 3] since Vf (1) − Vf (3) = 0 and f in fact still has a root in (1, 3]. ⋄

Curiously, most published accounts of Sturm’s Theorem avoid considering the presence of
any kind of root at an endpoint. Furthermore, many accounts assume that f has only simple
roots. In practice, such an assumption can only be enforced by computing square-free parts
— a potentially wasteful (and numerically unstable) computation, especially when speed is
critical.

The proof of Sturm’s Theorem is elementary, but is frequently derived as a consequence
of more intricate constructions. Considering its deep importance in numerical software, we
present a short direct proof. The theorem follows easily from a single lemma.

Lemma 1.4 Suppose f ∈ R[x1] has positive degree d, and c ∈ R. Then the following proper-
ties hold for the Sturm sequence Pf (c) = (p0(c), . . . , pd(c)):

1. (Sign Alternation Over a Simple Root) Suppose p0(c) = 0 and p1(c) 6= 0. Then for all
ε > 0 suﬃciently small, σ(p0(c − ε)) = −σ(p1(c − ε)) and σ(p0(c + ε)) = σ(p1(c + ε)).

2. (Stability Under Common Multiples) Suppose p0 and p1 are each divisible by g ∈ R[x1].

Then Pf = 1

g Pf /g.

1This theorem counts distinct roots and thus does not count multiple roots more than once.
2When a < b this half open interval includes b but does not include a, and we use the convention (a, a] = ∅.

European authors frequently use ]a, b] for what we call (a, b].

3. (Matching Sign Flips Over a Simple Node) Suppose pi(c) = 0 and pi+1(c) 6= 0 for some
i ≥ 1. Then σ(pi−1(c)) = −σ(pi+1(c)). Furthermore, for all ε > 0 suﬃciently small,
σ(pi−1(c − ε)) = −σ(pi+1(c − ε)) and σ(pi−1(c + ε)) = −σ(pi+1(c + ε)).

4. (Propagation of Zeroes) For any i ∈ {0, . . . , d − 2}, pi(c) = pi+1(c) = 0 implies that

pj(c) = 0 for all j ≥ i + 2.

We are now ready to prove our reﬁned version of Sturm’s Theorem.

Proof of Theorem 1.2:
Assertion (2): Since p0(c) = f (c) and p1(c) = f ′(c), the recurrence deﬁning the Sturm
sequence immediately implies that pj(c) = 0 for all all j ≥ 2, so we are done.

Assertion (1): If a = b, or f is a nonzero constant, then we clearly have Nf (a, b] = Vf (a) −
Vf (b) = 0 and Assertion (1) indeed holds. So let us assume a < b and that f has positive
degree d.

Let us now reduce to the special case where the following condition holds:

(a, b] contains at most 1 root of f , with b non-degenerate if it is a root of f .

(⋆)
To do so, suppose ﬁrst that f has roots in (a, b] and that, in strictly increasing order, they
are exactly ζ1, . . . , ζm. Letting (c1, . . . , cm) be any sequence satisfying

we then see that Vf (a) − Vf (b) is exactly

a < c1 < ζ1 < c2 < ζ2 < · · · < cm < ζm ≤ b,

(Vf (a) − Vf (c1)) + (Vf (c1) − Vf (c2)) + · · · + (Vf (cm−1) − Vf (cm)) + (Vf (cm) − Vf (b)).

Since, by deﬁnition, Nf (a, b] is exactly

Nf (a, c1]

+

Nf (c1, c2]

+ · · · + Nf (cm−1, cm] + Nf (cm, b]

it then clearly suﬃces to prove
Nf (a, c1] = Vf (a) − Vf (c1), Nf (c1, c2] = Vf (c1) − Vf (c2), . . . , Nf (cm−1, cm] = Vf (cm−1) − Vf (cm),
and Nf (cm, b] = Vf (cm) − Vf (b). In other words, whether or not f has roots in (a, b], we can
indeed assume Condition (⋆).

Let us now reduce even further to the special case where the following slightly stronger

(a, b] contains at most 1 root of f , and any root of f in (a, b] is simple.

condition holds:
(⋆⋆)
To do so, observe that g := gcd(f, f ′) ∈ R[x1] and, for all i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, f /g is divisible by
x − ζi but not divisible by (x − ζi)2. (The latter fact follows easily from the product rule for
diﬀerentation.) So f and f /g have the same real roots, except that all the real roots of f /g
are simple. By Assertion (2) of Lemma 1.4 we then obtain σ(Pf (c)g(c)) = σ(Pf /g(c)) and
thus σ(Pf (c)) = σ(g(c))σ(Pf /g(c)) for all real c. In particular, Vf (c) = Vf /g(c) as long as c is
not a multiple root. Since we are assuming that neither a nor b are multiple roots, we can
then clearly assume (⋆⋆).

We are now nearly done: Thanks to Condition (⋆⋆), the case where (a, b] contains a unique
root ζ follows immediately from Assertion (1) of Lemma 1.4, assuming we have proved the
case where (a, b] contains no roots of f . For then we obtain

Nf (a, b] = Nf (a, ζ − ε] + Nf (ζ − ε, ζ + ε] + Nf (ζ + ε, b] = 0 + 1 + 0,

where ε > 0 is suﬃciently small.

The ﬁnal case where (a, b] has no roots requires only one more reﬁnement: In our preced-
ing subdivision used to enforce Condition (⋆), suppose we picked more ci, so that the roots

3

of p1, . . . , pd (as well as those of p0 = f ) were also interlaced. Via the same trick of cancella-
tions in an alternating sum, we can thus reduce even further to the special case where (a, b]
contains no roots of f and contains at most 1 root of p1 · · · pd. By Assertion (3) of Lemma
1.4, we are done. (cid:4)

Proof of Lemma 1.4: Assertions (2) and (4) follow immediately from the recurrence

combination of p0 and p1, it is clear that g|p0 and g|p1 together imply that every pi is
divisible by g. Assertion (2) then follows immediately from the uniqueness of remainders in
polynomial division. For Assertion (4) one merely proceeds by induction.

To prove Assertion (1) note that if f ′(c) = p1(c) > 0 (resp. f ′(c) = p1(c) < 0) then f = p0
is locally increasing (resp. decreasing) at c. Since the sign of p1 is locally constant at c,
Assertion (1) follows immediately.

Assertion (3) follows easily upon observing that pi(c) = 0 implies that pi−1(c) = −pi+1(c),
thanks to the recurrence deﬁning the Sturm sequence. In particular, one need only observe
that the signs of pi−1 and pi+1 are locally constant at c, so σ(pi−1(c − ε)) = σ(pi−1(c)) =
σ(pi−1(c + ε)) and σ(pi+1(c − ε)) = σ(pi+1(c)) = σ(pi+1(c + ε)). (cid:4)
