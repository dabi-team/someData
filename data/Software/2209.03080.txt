ABSTRACT
New classes of astronomical objects are often discovered serendipitously. The enormous data volumes produced by
recent high-time resolution, radio-telescope surveys imply that eﬃcient algorithms are required for a discovery. Such
algorithms are usually tuned to detect speciﬁc, known sources. Existing data sets therefore likely contain unknown
astronomical sources, which will remain undetected unless algorithms are developed that can detect a more diverse
range of signals. We present the Single-dish PARKES data challenge for ﬁnding the uneXpected (SPARKESX), a
compilation of real and simulated high-time resolution observations. SPARKESX comprises three mock surveys from
the Parkes “Murriyang” radio telescope. A broad selection of simulated and injected expected signals (such as pulsars,
fast radio bursts), poorly characterised signals (plausible ﬂare star signatures) and unknown unknowns are generated
for each survey. The goal of this challenge is to aid in the development of new algorithms that can detect a wide-range
of source types. We show how successful a typical pipeline based on the standard pulsar search software, PRESTO,
is at ﬁnding the injected signals. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.25919/fd4f-0g20.

1 INTRODUCTION

The quest to ﬁnd the unknown objects in our vast universe
is one of the most intriguing challenges in modern astro-
physics. Astronomical discoveries can be separated into two
broad classes, the “known unknowns” and the “unknown un-
knowns” (Norris 2017). The known unknowns relate to dis-
covering more of a particular class of astronomical object with
unknown origin, such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) or pulsars.
The “unknown unknowns” relate to unexpected signals that,
if proven to be astronomical in origin, will lead to new areas
of astronomical research.

Many astronomical objects and phenomena are discov-
ered using radio telescopes, making radio astronomy surveys
ideal for searching for even more astronomical objects (Ekers
2009). One of the largest steerable single dish radio telescopes
is the Parkes “Murriyang” telescope. With its large 64 metre

aperture dish and high sensitivity, the Parkes telescope is ca-
pable of mapping large areas of the sky and has made many
major scientiﬁc discoveries in the time-domain astronomy, in-
cluding FRBs (e.g., Lorimer et al. 2007), pulsars (e.g., Manch-
ester et al. 2001), double pulsars (e.g., Burgay et al. 2003),
and rotating radio transients (McLaughlin et al. 2006). The
observations from these surveys are publicly available from
the Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Or-
ganisation (CSIRO) Data Access Portal (DAP)1. The tele-
scope is also involved in the Breakthrough Listen project,
a 10 year-long initiative to search for extraterrestrial intelli-
gence (SETI; Merali 2015; Isaacson et al. 2017; Price et al.
2018). The data from the Breakthrough Listen project are
also open access2.

Unknown signals (speciﬁcally SETI) have long been sought

with interest and at the same time, with considerable skep-
ticism. Many theories and speculations have been proposed,
yet the nature of such sources remains a mystery (see re-
views by e.g., Ekers et al. 2002; Wright 2022). One pioneering
suggestion was to look for “beacons” or indications of tech-
nosignatures in the radio frequency range between 1–10 GHz
across interstellar space (Cocconi & Morrison 1959). Typical
SETI experiments search for narrowband spectral signals in
frequency-time images or spectrograms which have a Doppler
drift rate caused by the relative radial acceleration from the
transmitter to the receiver (Drake 1961). However, such sig-
natures can be similar to terrestrial and/or space-borne radio
frequency interference (RFI), which results in a vast number
of false candidates (e.g., Tarter 2001; Siemion et al. 2013;
Enriquez et al. 2017; Wright et al. 2018; Price et al. 2020;
Perez et al. 2020; Sheikh et al. 2020; Wlodarczyk-Sroka et al.
2020; Margot et al. 2021; Gajjar et al. 2021; Traas et al.
2021). A narrowband technosignature veriﬁcation framework
has been established in order to eliminate false events that
are attributed to RFI (Sheikh et al. 2021).

Instead of directing high power into a narrow frequency
window, it is also possible that extraterrestrial beacons are
compressed in time having the form of a short broadband
pulse (Cole & Ekers 1979). Radio pulses are dispersed in the
interstellar medium and exhibit positive dispersion measure
(DM). An extraterrestrial civilisation therefore might deliber-
ately send an artiﬁcially induced broadband signal with neg-
ative DM (Siemion et al. 2010; von Korﬀ 2010; Harp et al.
2018; Li et al. 2020; Gajjar et al. 2021). Searches for such ar-
tiﬁcial dispersed signals have been conducted, but none have
yet been found (Gajjar et al. 2021).

Numerous software packages have been developed to search
for individual, dispersed pulse events. Two of the most com-
mon open source pulsar search software packages are the Pul-
saR Exploration and Search TOolkit3 (PRESTO; Ransom
2001; Ransom et al. 2002) and SIGPROC4 (Lorimer 2011).
Both have been rigorously tested and maintained, and have
been used to discover many pulsed radio sources. With the
high growth rate of data volume, there is an increasing de-
mand for real-time or near real-time processing. The next
generation telescope surveys will generate petabytes of data
per year, triggering the need to handle the data in an eﬃ-
cient way. The advancement of technology has allowed this to
become feasible through the innovation of graphics process-
ing units (GPUs), which signiﬁcantly increase the process-
ing power and speed. Several GPU-based single pulse search
software packages have been developed including Heimdall5
(Barsdell 2012), peasoup6 (Barr 2014, 2020), and AstroAc-
celerate7 (Ad´amek & Armour 2020). Typically, these al-
gorithms de-disperse the data set at many DM trials be-
fore searching for pulsed events in the resulting time series.
This can be computationally intensive and various fast de-
dispersion techniques have been proposed, such as the fast
DM transform (Zackay & Ofek 2017) and the Fourier-domain
de-dispersion (Bassa et al. 2022). These algorithms assume
the dispersion law and hence are not designed to detect other

signatures that may be present in the data stream. Several
factors including the presence of RFI and poorly matched ﬁl-
ters, will aﬀect the sensitivity and completeness of the search
(see e.g., Barsdell et al. 2012; Keane & Petroﬀ 2015; van
Heerden et al. 2017).

Recent developments in artiﬁcial intelligence and machine
learning have also brought forth new possibilities. Machine
learning and deep learning approaches have already been ap-
plied to classify single pulses (Zhang et al. 2018; Connor &
van Leeuwen 2018; Agarwal et al. 2020; K¨unkel et al. 2021). In
addition, numerous data challenges are being setup in the as-
tronomy community (Hloˇzek 2019). A few examples are data
challenges relating to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(Kessler et al. 2019), the Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathﬁnder and Evolutionary Map of the Universe (Hopkins
et al. 2015), and the Square Kilometre Array (Bonaldi &
Braun 2018).

The aim of this paper is to provide a collection of time-
series dataset consisting of simulated and injected signals that
are both likely within our data streams (such as FRBs) and
unexpected, more generic signals. The artiﬁcial signals are
inserted into simulated data and also into actual Parkes ob-
servations. This work presents a standardised set of tests that
have been carefully designed to explore the pros and cons
of diﬀerent algorithms. The baseline results from a standard
method are provided for comparison with existing or new
pipelines. The data is publicly available and we expect will
be used by numerous groups to develop and test their search
algorithms prior to applying them to actual observations.

The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes
the dataset and the diﬀerent types of signals generated. Base-
line results using PRESTO are presented in Section 3. In Sec-
tion 4, we discuss the limitations of the PRESTO pipeline
and challenges in the data. Finally, the conclusion and fu-
ture direction are provided in Section 5. We describe how to
download the data challenge in Appendix A.

2 DATA AND SIMULATION

Our mock “Single-dish PARKES radio telescope for ﬁnding
the uneXpected (SPARKESX)” dataset was created using the
simulateSearch8 software package (Luo et al. 2022). Luo
et al. (2022) provides general details about the simulation
software, which can simulate a range of source types for dif-
ferent observing modes at various telescopes. Here we explic-
itly apply that software to produce fake observations from
the Parkes radio telescope. The majority of the actual sur-
vey data from the Parkes telescope was obtained using a 13-
beam, 20 cm receiver (the “multibeam”). We simulated three
mock surveys. The ﬁrst mock survey has similar properties to
the multibeam survey datasets that make up the bulk of the
Parkes data archive, but, in this case, we only simulate data
corresponding to a single beam. We do this as many data pro-
cessing algorithms treat the beams independently. However,
in particular for transient events, multibeam information is
invaluable for distinguishing between astronomical sources
and radio frequency interference. The second mock survey

is based on longer-duration observations of the Magellanic
Clouds (Manchester et al. 2006) and here we simulate data
for all 13 beams of the multibeam receiver. The third provides
an example of the next generation of high time-resolution
surveys that will shortly begin with a cryogenically-cooled
phased array feed (PAF). The PAF will provide up to 76
beams, but again here we only simulate a single beam. The
system parameters are listed in Table 1. In all cases, we only
simulate one polarisation channel.

The simulated data are stored in PSRFITS format9 (Hotan
et al. 2004), which is adapted from the Flexible Image Trans-
port System (FITS; Wells et al. 1981) ﬁle format. The data
are partitioned into blocks of a speciﬁed number of time sam-
ples (NSBLK) and are recorded in successive rows (or sub-
integrations) in the ﬁle. The multibeam survey data are 1-bit
quantised with a level setting procedure applied that oper-
ates with a rolling time constant of 0.9 second (see Manch-
ester et al. 2001). The ﬁrst block for the simulated PAF data
streams are used to set the 2-bit quantisation and then the
levels are held ﬁxed for the remainder of the observation.

For a given set of input events (described below), a total
of 50 search mode data ﬁles were generated for surveys with
a single beam, i.e., the single-beam representations of the
multibeam and PAF surveys. For the 13-beam data sets, we
only provide injected simulated signals into real data (see
Section 2.2).

Our work here is based around developing and comparing
algorithms that can identify rare events. We therefore ex-
plicitly ensure that the events (1) do not overlap with each
other and (2) only form a small fraction of each data ﬁle. We
also require the means to determine whether an algorithm
has failed or succeeded in identifying any event. Each frame,
for the 1-beam simulations, either contains one event or no
events. In order to achieve this, we reset the 1-bit level setting
process at the frame edges. For very bright events, simulated
near the edge of the frame this can lead to unrealistic step-
changes in the noise properties at the frame boundaries. This
is not an issue for the 2-bit data streams.

The 50 data ﬁles for the single-beam mock surveys provide
ample data for testing diﬀerent search algorithms. Each ﬁle
contains 1000 frames with 10 percent of the data containing
a signal of interest (100 events). An overview of the number
of generated ﬁles is in Table A1 in Appendix A. In this case,
the multibeam nature of the observations are simulated and
we do not divide the data set into speciﬁc frames and so these
simulations are most like the actual observations and can be
used to test streaming-based (i.e., not speciﬁc to individual
frames) search methods.

We do not simulate realistic survey observation times as we
simply need the data to be long enough for our tests. Each

9 https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrfits_
definition/Psrfits.html

survey has a diﬀerent sampling time (see Table 1). The num-
ber of samples per sub-integration (NSBLK) is set to 4096.
We have used frame lengths of ∼ 1 second corresponding to
1 sub-integration for the single-beam and 4 sub-integrations
for the PAF simulations.

All the simulated data ﬁles contain fake radiometer noise.
This is modelled (see Section 3.2 of Luo et al. 2022) assum-
ing a Gaussian distribution with a speciﬁc amplitude derived
from an assumed system temperature of 21 K and telescope
gain of 0.735 K Jy−1 (e.g., Manchester et al. 2001; Keith et al.
2010). Events that are dispersed in the interstellar medium
are modelled using the arrival time diﬀerence, ∆t, between
two pulses at frequency, ν:

where α is the spectral exponent. For FRBs and pulsars,
α is −2. As our events do not overlap and must ﬁt within
a single frame, we limited the maximum DM simulated to
be 1087 pc cm−3 for the single-beam from multibeam and
458 pc cm−3 for the PAF survey.

2.1 Type of Simulated Events

For each of the 1-beam data sets, we have simulated the
six categories of injected source types that are listed in Ta-
ble 2. The ﬁrst (noise) has no injected signal and simply
contains radiometer noise. The second (rfi) contains ra-
diometer noise and RFI, but no astronomical signal. We
then simulate idealised FRB-like signals (simplepulse) that
are broadband, have no frequency-dependent structure and
exactly follow the frequency-squared dispersion law. The
fourth (known+rfi) contains more realistic signals includ-
ing likely signals from ﬂare stars and FRB-like events that
contain frequency-dependent pulse structure. The ﬁfth set
(unknown+rfi) of simulations contain more generic source
shapes (representing the “unknown unknowns”) and ﬁnally
we include all event types (combo+rfi).

Distributions of the properties for the simulated and in-
jected signals are provided in Table 3 and justiﬁed in the sec-
tions below. Examples of simulated events are displayed in
Fig. 1 for the multibeam and Fig. 2 for the PAF survey. The
examples have been chosen so the events are visually identiﬁ-
able. In general, due to the range of parameters that we have
chosen, most of the simulated signals or events are either too
faint and/or too narrow to be seen visually. Note that in the
actual observations from the multibeam receiver system, the
channel bandwidth is negative and so the highest observing
frequency is at the bottom of such plots for the multibeam
survey dataset. This is accounted for in our simulated multi-
beam datasets, but for clarity has been switched-around in
the ﬁgures presented here.

2.1.1 RFI

RFI is ubiquitous. Observatories such as Parkes are not sit-
uated in large-scale radio quiet zones and visitors to the site
bring mobile handsets, WiFi devices, etc. Even observato-
ries within radio quiet zones are aﬀected by satellite and air-
craft communications. The observations are also aﬀected by
broadband, transient signals from impulsive broadband radio
sources such as lightning, or from strong impulsive RFI else-
where in the band saturating the receiver or backend system.

We have chosen representative ﬁles from the actual multi-
beam survey data sets and inspected them, by eye, to infer
reasonable properties of the RFI. These observations were
primarily aﬀected by point-to-point microwave links above
1433 MHz, which modulated on time scales of fractions of
a second. The number of point-to-point microwave links of
2 MHz wide was randomly chosen between 1 and 5 at random
central frequencies above 1433 MHz. The microwave links
switch on and oﬀ on time scales of seconds. Each microwave
link is simulated independently. They have randomly chosen
“on” and “oﬀ” durations between 0.1 and 3 seconds. The peak
ﬂux amplitude is randomly distributed 0.1 ≤ Speak[Jy] ≤ 1.

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2022)

Since there are no actual observations yet from the PAF, we
examined data from the SUrvey for Pulsars and Extragalac-
tic Radio Bursts (SUPERB; Keane et al. 2018), which are
2-bit sampled, as well as observations from the Parkes ultra-
wide-bandwidth receiver (Hobbs et al. 2020), which covers
the frequency range of the PAF between 1050 and 1550 MHz.
This frequency range requires models of satellite interference,
in particular the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).
The GNSS constellations include the Global Positioning Sys-
tem (GPS) from United States, Global Navigation Satellite
System (GLONASS) from Russia, BeiDou Navigation Satel-
lite System from China, and Galileo from Europe. Up to 5 of
these are randomly selected with varying peak ﬂux amplitude
of 10 ≤ Speak[Jy] ≤ 500 and can come and go on a scale of
1–10 minutes.

Impulsive RFI is included in our simulations with logarith-
mic uniform occurrence rate ranging from 0.1 to 1 percent of
the total number of samples. The amplitude of this RFI is
modelled following a power law distribution and the width is
ﬁxed to be 256 µs.

2.1.2 Simple Pulses

We assume that idealised, single pulses from pulsars or FRB
events can be modelled as a Gaussian proﬁle deﬁned by
an amplitude, A, and a width, w. The lower threshold of
the amplitude is selected to be about an order of magni-
tude lower than that can be detected by PRESTO. We
simulate a logarithmic uniform distribution in A and w as
10−3 ≤ A[Jy] ≤ 20 and 10−4 ≤ w[second] ≤ 0.1. Note that
these are not designed to represent an actual, physical distri-
bution of these parameters; instead they are chosen to cover
the expected parameter space that will be probed during such
simulations.

2.1.3 Known Unknowns

We consider possible signals that have durations less than a
simulated frame (∼ 1 second), are detectable in the frequency
band covered, but are not commonly searched for in such data
sets.

2.1.3.1 More realistic single pulses: We allow the single
pulses from pulsars and FRBs to contain frequency structure.
Pulsars exhibit scintillation, whereas FRBs exhibit complex,
narrowband frequency structure that is currently unexplained
(e.g., Pleunis et al. 2021; Dai et al. 2022). We model such sig-
nals using dynamic spectra with varying intensity at each
frequency channel. We randomly choose between a dynamic
spectrum based on Kolmogorov turbulence in the interstel-
lar medium and a dynamic spectrum with sharp frequency
cutoﬀs (Coles et al. 2010; Dai et al. 2016). In the latter case,
we assume the pulse is only present in only segment of the
dynamic spectrum, which is at least 10 frequency channels
wide.

2.1.3.2 Long-duration pulses: Pulsar and magnetar-like ob-
jects are now known with pulse periods of 10 s of seconds to
several minutes (e.g., Tan et al. 2018; Hurley-Walker et al.
2022). We therefore simulate single pulse events that follow
the dispersion law, but with pulse widths signiﬁcantly larger
than those typically found in pulsar searches. Here we model
such events with pulse widths from 0.1 to 0.5 seconds, mod-
elled as a rectangular proﬁle instead of Gaussian to prevent
wide pulses overlapping multiple frames.

2.1.3.3 Stellar radio bursts: Traditional search pipelines ex-
plicitly search for dispersed signals, with the pulse frequency
drift having a frequency dependence of ν−2. However, stellar
radio bursts (such as from brown dwarfs, M-dwarfs, and mag-
netic chemically peculiar stars) typically exhibit linear fre-
quency drifts in the frequency ranges and time-scales of inter-
est in this work (e.g., Osten & Bastian 2008; Zic et al. 2019),
although more complex morphologies are possible (e.g., Hess
& Zarka 2011; Leto et al. 2017). Furthermore, the frequency
drift rate ˙ν can also be positive or negative, i.e., the burst
may arrive later at higher ( ˙ν > 0) or at lower observing fre-
quencies ( ˙ν < 0), with respect to a chosen reference frequency
νref. We model such events with peak ﬂux intensity of 10−2 ≤
Speak[Jy] ≤ 1 and Gaussian width 10−3 ≤ w[second] ≤ 0.5.

Although the range of drift rate is set to be 0.5 ≤
| ˙ν|[MHz s−1] ≤ 2000, the value is determined based on the

randomly generated event time and νref that ﬁts inside a sin-
gle time frame. The total bandwidth spans 100 ≤ ∆ν[MHz] ≤
2000. We further apply the constraint that fast drift rate
˙ν > | ± 500| MHz s−1 ﬂares typically have narrow width
w < 0.1 s, while those that are slow have wider width. Conse-
quently, mostly, if not all, are fast and narrow ﬂares simulated
than slow and broad ﬂares, as the latter has steeper linear
drift rate and less likely to ﬁt in the frame. Additionally, fast
narrow ﬂares can have multiple components and we simulate
1 to 10 multiple bursts in the same frame with the same drift
rate and width, while other parameters vary.

2.1.4 Unknown Unknowns

Simulating “unknown unknowns” is clearly impossible in a
well-deﬁned, quantitative manner. Instead we have searched
the literature for likely signatures and attempted to make
models of generic functional forms.

2.1.4.1 Negative DM pulses: Pulsars and FRBs are mod-
elled with a positive DM value and spectral exponent of −2.
Here, we generalise to negative DMs using the same DM limit
as minimum, i.e., from −1087 pc cm−3 for multibeam and
−458 pc cm−3 for PAF to 0 pc cm−3. The exponents range
from −1.5 < α < 4 with a constraint that the event has to
ﬁt within the frame.

2.1.4.2 Spline curves: Splines provide the means to simulate
smooth, wide-band, impulsive events of arbitrary form. We
randomly inject spline curves with amplitudes from 10−2 to
20 Jy, number of nodes from 2 to 10, and a maximum possible
width range of 10−4 to 0.1 second. The connected nodes are
evenly separated in frequency space to yield a smooth curve.

2.1.4.3 Steganography: We can embed information (a mes-
sage) into the data set. To do this, we can simply convert
an image into time-frequency pixels, in a similar fashion to
the interstellar radio messages that have been transmitted
from Earth. Among those transmitted pictorial messages, we
use Arecibo message (Staﬀ at the National Astronomy &
Ionosphere Center 1975) and Cosmic Call as input images.
The Arecibo message contains seven components, which rep-
resents numbers, DNA elements, nucleotides, double helix,
humanity, planets, and telescope. The Cosmic Call consists
of 23 images, with symbols designed to encompass concepts
on numbers, mathematics, units, chemistry, physics, biology,
and astronomy.

We include 31 steganography images, eight from the
Arecibo message, where seven of which are the diﬀerent com-
ponents and one is the entire image, and 23 from Cosmic Call.
The images are randomly selected and scaled to various sizes
with intensity range of 10−2 to 100 Jy. The height in pixel is
set to be at least half the total number of channels, while the
width can be as narrow as 1 pixel.

2.2 Injection into Real Data

All combinations of the simulated signals are also injected
into actual observational data for multibeam surveys. No ex-
tra radiometer noise nor RFI has been added into these. We

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2022)

8

S. Yong et al.

randomly chose 50 real observation data ﬁles from the multi-
beam survey, which were downloaded from the CSIRO data
archive. Each ﬁle has 2051 sub-integrations. We injected into
10 percent of the total frames an event (corresponding to 205
events). Examples of injected signals into real data are shown
in Fig. 3. Of course the real data contains RFI and poten-
tially contains astronomical sources. We explicitly chose ﬁles
which do not contain known pulsars or FRBs events.

For the 13-beam data sets, we speciﬁcally chose the set of
13 ﬁles that contain a well-known FRB, the Lorimer burst,
which was downloaded from the CSIRO DAP10. The actual
Lorimer burst is detected in sub-integration 421 primarily in
beams 6 and 13. The sampling time is higher compared to the
earlier surveys and so the maximum DM limit is set for our
injected events to be 3000 pc cm−3. Similarly, 10 percent of
the total 2051 sub-integrations are injected with 205 events.
This dataset is not partitioned into frames as this allows us to
test streaming-based search methods. The signal strength in
a particular beam depends upon the beam pattern (which we
model using a simple sinc2-function) and the distance from
the source to the beam centre. Clearly our simulations would
not be useful if the events were all simulated well-away from
the beam pointing direction and so we provide three diﬀer-
ent scenarios for the source position, which are illustrated in
Fig. 4 and detailed below:

(1) Type 1: For a given event, we randomly choose which
beam it will be in and then inject it as if the source was in
the pointing direction of that beam. The event is not injected
into the other beams. In Fig. 4a, the source is injected into
the central beam.

(2) Type 2: Each event is always assumed to come from the
pointing direction of the central beam, but the signal is also
seen in the other beams with the amplitude being scaled by
the angular oﬀset of that beam to the source. So, in this case,
the central beam contains all the events exactly as they are
simulated and the other beams also contains the same event,
but at weaker amplitudes. In Fig. 4b, the source is injected
into the central beams, but the signal strength is so strong
that it is detected also in the side-lobes of the outer beams.
(3) Type 3: For every event, we randomly choose a sky
position in the ﬁeld of view and so sometimes the event will
be strongest in one beam, sometimes in another and some-
times half-way between two. In Fig. 4c, the source position is
slightly oﬀset from the central beam position.

3 APPLYING PRESTO TO THE DATA CHALLENGE

Our data challenge consists of a large number of labelled
events. The primary use of this challenge will be to compare
the eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent algorithms in detecting the simu-
lated signals. A commonly-used software package for search-
ing for signals aﬀected by cold-plasma dispersion such as
bright periodic pulses and FRBs, is PRESTO (Ransom 2001;
Ransom et al. 2002). PRESTO is used to de-dispserse the
data ﬁles at a range of DMs, produce time series for each
DM trial by averaging across the frequency channels (ac-
counting for the presence of RFI and bad channels) and then

10 https://doi.org/10.4225/08/5819628e4fed9

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2022)

searching for pulsed signals. In the following analysis, we re-
strict our analysis to the single beam mock surveys as the
primary single-pulse search algorithm in PRESTO runs on
single beam data sets. We note that the output candidates
could (and often are) subsequently shifted based on multi-
beam information.

PRESTO has many options to optimise the search for
a particular survey. Here, we choose a simple set of pa-
rameters (mostly using the default values) as representative
PRESTO output. We therefore expect that our PRESTO-
based pipeline to be optimal for simple FRB-like pulses in
a low RFI environment. Our pipeline is not expected to be
optimal for other types of events.

The outline of this search pipeline is as follows:

(1) Process each search-mode data ﬁle independently.
(2) Mask RFI using rfifind, except for data ﬁles only
containing radiometer noise. The integration time is set to
be 2 second. The “no scales” and “no oﬀsets” options are also
used.

(3) Create a de-dispersion plan using DDplan.py. The
lower limit of DM search range is set to be 0 pc cm−3 and
upper DM of 800 pc cm−3 for the multibeam and 300 pc cm−3
for the PAF survey. This upper limit is purposely set to be
lower than the simulated DM values to probe the drop oﬀ in
detection rate for events at high DM. The observation param-
eters for DDplan.py include the central frequency, bandwidth,
number of channels, and sampling time, which are based on
the raw PSRFITS ﬁle header information.

(4) Run de-dispersion on the data using prepsubband from
the generated DDplan.py. The number of subbands is set to
32. The “no scales”, “no oﬀsets”, “no barycenter”, and “no clip”
options are also used.

(5) Search for single pulses in the data with a boxcar
matched ﬁlter using single_pulse_search.py. The “fast”
and “no bad-blocks” options are enabled (noting that this
will reduce PRESTO’s sensitivity to long-duration events).
A signal-to-noise (S/N) threshold of 7σ is used to identify
candidates that get recorded to disk for comparison with the
injected events.

The single pulse search yields output ﬁles containing a list
of candidates along with their estimated DM, S/N, and time.
We remove candidates with zero DM. The resulting candi-
dates are then binned per frame and those with the highest
S/N within that bin are then returned. This ensures that
multiple detections of the same event are grouped together
and only counted once.

We note that there are diﬀerences between the process-
ing of the two simulated surveys. Our PRESTO single pulse
search sets the maximum down-sampling to be 32 times of
the sampling time, which is 8 and 1.8 ms respectively for the
multibeam and PAF surveys. This choice of default parame-
terisation therefore means that we are less sensitive to wide
events in the PAF survey than in the multibeam survey.

3.1 Baseline Scoring Metrics

The goal is to maximise the chance of ﬁnding astronomical
signals in the datasets, and so the relevant evaluation metrics
reﬂect the number of true and false positives and negatives
found. These are presented in the confusion matrix shown
in Table 4. The true positive (TP) and true negative (TN)

SPARKESX Data Challenge

values are the numbers of the correctly predicted outcomes
for events and non-events, respectively. False positive (FP)
and false negative (FN) events are those that are wrongly
predicted as an event and non-event, respectively. The to-
tal positives (P) is the sum of TP and FN, while the total
negatives (N) is the sum of TN and FP.

From the confusion matrix, we can evaluate various scoring
metrics including the recall, precision, fall-out, and F1 score.

• Recall (also known as sensitivity, hit rate, or true positive
rate) measures the ability to identify all positives, which is
given by

Recall =

TP
TP + FN

.

• Precision (or positive predictive value) measures the abil-

ity to not mislabel negatives as positives, which is given by

Precision =

TP
TP + FP

.

• Fall-out (or false positive rate) measures the probability
of mislabelled positives that are negatives, which is given by

Fall-out =

FP
FP + TN

.

• F1 score measures the balance between precision and

recall, which is given by

F1 = 2

(cid:18) 1

Recall

+

1
Precision

(cid:19)−1

.

The F1 score is used since it is less biased toward data sets
where there are more events than non-events (He & Ma 2013).
These scoring metrics are presented in Table 4. All scores
range from 0 to 1, with 1 being perfect, except for fall-out,
in which a lower score represents a better result.

3.2 Results using PRESTO

The primary goals for running PRESTO on our simulation
are (1) to demonstrate that the simulations are reliable and
(2) to ensure that we cover suﬃcient parameter space in the
properties of the injected signals to allow us to compare the
eﬀectiveness of new algorithms with PRESTO.

The simplest simulation contains only radiometer noise.
As shown in Table 4, there were no false detections using
PRESTO for the multibeam simulation, but six for the PAF
simulation. The six false detections had S/N < 7.4σ, which
is only slightly above our cut-oﬀ S/N of 7σ. We did not ex-
plicitly choose the cut-oﬀ based on the expected false alarm
rate (which is commonly determined using simulations such
as our data set) and therefore this is not unexpected.

We expected that when RFI is added into the radiometer

noise the number of false detections would increase. This does
occur for the PAF simulations, but not for the multibeam.
Both simulated surveys include impulsive RFI, which has a
width of 256 µs equalling the sampling rate for the multibeam
survey, but contains multiple samples for the PAF sampling.
The majority of the PAF-survey false detections were caused
by impulsive transient events and detected with very low DM
values (DM = 0.05 pc cm−3, noting that we explicitly did not
search candidates with DM = 0 pc cm−3).

The simplepulse dataset, which contains idealised, single
pulse events, without any RFI, represents the scenario where
PRESTO is expected to be optimal. Figure 5 shows the true
positive detection rate (blue solid line). Fig. 6 plots the de-
tectability of simulated events as a function of amplitude,
width and dispersion measure. The orange histogram in each
panel of Fig. 5 shows the injected distribution of event pa-
rameters. For the pulse amplitudes and widths, the injected
amplitude is ﬂat. However, the number of generated high-DM
pulses reduces with increasing DM because of the requirement
of ensuring that each event ﬁts within a single frame.

We searched for single pulse events with DMs up to 800
and 300 pc cm−3 for the multibeam and PAF surveys, re-
spectively. We therefore expect (and see) a drop-oﬀ in the
detectability of single pulse events higher than those cut-oﬀ
values, as indicated by the grey dashed vertical line in the
left panels of Fig. 5. As shown in the central panels (where
we show the true positive rate as a function of amplitude),
we have chosen a range of amplitudes that covers from being
undetectable with PRESTO to close to 100 percent detec-
tion. This allows users of this data challenge to compare their
own algorithms against PRESTO in low, mid, and high-S/N
cases. We note that comparing the central panels for the two
simulated surveys gives the impression that the simulated
PAF survey is less sensitive than the simulated multibeam
survey. As described in Section 3, this is caused by our choice
of PRESTO parameters means (we are less sensitive to wide
events in the PAF survey compared with the multibeam sur-
vey). In terms of the evaluation metrics (Table 4), PRESTO
provides baseline measurements of the four parameters. In
summary, the F1 score of ∼ 0.6 and precision of ∼ 0.9 shows
that PRESTO is, as expected, an eﬀective algorithm for ﬁnd-
ing ideal, simple, single pulse events.

Our procedure does produce a small number of false “true
positives”. For instance, in Fig. 6 we see true positive detec-
tions for a few very low amplitude events. This can occur
simply by chance (i.e., a 7σ result in the frame corresponding
to a weak event, and hence, identiﬁed as a “true positive”).
This can also occur if a bright single pulse was simulated near
an edge of a frame. Searching at an incorrect DM can smear
some of that bright signal into the adjacent frame where a
weaker (and undetectable signal was simulated) and that ear-

analysis we ignore this issue and note that a more painstak-
ing analysis of the PRESTO candidates could resolve these
issues.

The known+rfi simulations represent idealised single pulses

as well as more realistic single pulses whose proﬁles include
frequency dependence, long-period pulse events, and the ex-
pected signatures from stellar ﬂares. The PRESTO analy-
sis leads to signiﬁcantly more false negatives, false positives
and fewer true positives than in the simpler cases. The corre-

sponding evaluation metrics for recall, precision and F1 score,
all reduce for this simulation, with the fall-out increasing. We
group the results by type of simulated event in Figs. 7 and 8
for the multibeam and PAF surveys, respectively. Here we
plot the number of simulated and detected events as a func-
tion of the source types. The lowest detectability is for real
pulses; these are pulses that have frequency structure and do
not emit across the entire bandwidth. We therefore expect
a reduction in sensitivity to such bursts as PRESTO inte-

grates across the entire bandwidth. This is more noticeable
for the PAF survey where the bandwidth is larger than in the
multibeam survey.

We note that PRESTO is able to detect 30 to 40 per-
cent of our ﬂare star signatures. The ﬂare star signals con-
tain frequency evolution (again implying less sensitivity with
the wider bandwidth of the PAF survey) and contain a linear
time-frequency dependence. The linear trend will deviate fur-
ther from the dispersion curve over the wider bandwidth for

the PAF survey. Some of the ﬂare star signals can be modelled
relatively well with a positive DM and hence PRESTO does
detect such events. However, other events have the equivalent
of negative DMs and PRESTO only detects the brightest of
these.

Table 4 and Figs. 7b and 8b show the results for unexpected
signals in the simulated data sets. We expect that PRESTO
is not an optimal algorithm for such signals, but that it will
detect bright signals that can approximately be modelled us-
ing a dispersion law. Out of these source types, the injected
images are most likely to be detected by PRESTO, whereas
the pulse events that do not follow a frequency-squared law
or spline curves have similar detectability.

The combinations (combo+rfi and real+combo) represent
the most realistic possible data sets and we discuss these fur-
ther in Section 4.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Using the Data Challenge to Test a New Algorithm

We chose only to use PRESTO in providing our baseline re-
sults. There are numerous other algorithms already available
for searching for signals in high-time resolution data sets (and
other options that can be trialled within PRESTO itself). To
compare those algorithms, or newly developed algorithms,
with PRESTO, our data challenge can be used. Each frame
in our data challenge includes either one injected event, or
none. The data collection contains comma-separated values
(CSV) ﬁles (in the gtbaseline_label directory) that labels
each frame (in the label column) and whether our PRESTO
analysis detected an event, or not (in the label_presto col-
umn). Refer to Appendix A for more details.

The results from any algorithm that provides labels for
each frame can therefore be compared with the true injec-
tions and also with the PRESTO output. The results can be
grouped or ﬁltered based on the diﬀerent properties or types,
as illustrated in Figs. 5 to 8. To make the histogram in Fig. 5,
the parameter values were binned into 20 equal width bins
within the minimum and maximum range. To make the plots
in Figs. 6 to 8, the true positives were grouped by the column
type.

As a demonstration, we viewed a subset of the data by eye.
For the simplepulse and real+combo datasets for the multi-
beam survey, we viewed each frame where a signal has been
injected, using the pfits_plot of the pfits package (Hobbs
2021). We recorded whether, or not, we saw a signal of in-
terest. In Figs. 5a, 6a and 7d, we compare the methods. The
true positive rate is shown for the PRESTO result overlaid
on the by-eye analysis in Fig. 5a. As expected, both analy-
ses detect the majority of the bright events, but the by-eye
analysis is less eﬀective than PRESTO at identifying weaker
events. Out of the 5000 simulated events for idealised pulses,
the FN and FP for the analysis by eye are 3209 and 1791,
respectively, which yields the recall evaluation metric of 0.36.
As expected, this is worse than the PRESTO recall of 0.53.
PRESTO missed 78 FRBs that were detected by eye. The
majority of these had high DMs that were above our DM
search (see also the left panel in Fig. 5a).

The analysis by eye of the injections of all events types
into actual observations is summarised in Fig. 7d. The by-
eye analysis in this case is remarkably good and out-performs

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2022)

PRESTO even for the injected idealised FRB-like pulses.
This is because the eye easily picks up bright, wide pulses.
However, in the presence of RFI, the rfifind procedure can-
not distinguish those events from RFI and therefore masks
the corresponding parts of the data.

It is relatively easy by-eye to ﬁrst identify the types of
narrow-band RFI present in the real data and then to look
for anomalous signals (of any type). The eye is drawn to
“edges” (for example the boundaries of the images and the
spline curves). The eye is not biased towards positive or neg-
ative slopes, but was biased towards events occurring near
the middle of each frame (short-duration events on the edges
were commonly missed).

4.2 Limitations of the Data Challenge

The data challenge contains a large amount of data. We have
explicitly chosen such data volumes to ensure that the data
set can, if required, be divided into training and test data sets
(or validation). If, however, the data volume is not suﬃcient
(or the user wishes to produce simulated data sets relevant
for their telescope and observing system) then it is relatively
easy to produce further data sets using the parameters of
the input signals described in this paper. Details on how to
produce the simulations using simulateSearch software are
available from Luo et al. (2022).

Our data challenge has been divided into frames, which
contain either an event or no event. This division leads to
three challenges:

• Our requirement that high-DM events are constrained
to a speciﬁc frame implies that all high-DM events start near
the beginning of each frame. Any use of this data challenge
to train a machine learning algorithm therefore needs to take
this into account (potentially by including more than a single
frame when training the algorithm).

• For very narrow events, an algorithm (including by-eye
visualisation) would be more eﬀective by “zooming-in” around
the event. The choice of how much data is provided to any
algorithm therefore may aﬀect the sensitivity of that algo-
rithm.

• Real events in actual observations will not be clearly de-
limited into frames. Any algorithm being developed therefore
must work for events that cross sub-integration boundaries.

Our datasets contain only relatively short-duration events
of ∼ 1 second. We are therefore not probing the detectability
of longer-duration events through this data challenge.

Even though we have simulated mock multibeam and PAF
surveys, we have concentrated on the shape of the features
likely in the data streams. We do not claim the completeness
of all possible combinations of signals in the dataset. The sim-
ulateSearch software has been developed to make it easy to
simulate generic signal types. The user can therefore update
the data challenge with other types of events as necessary.

4.3 Towards the Development of New Search Algorithms

PRESTO is able, as expected, to detect nearly all idealised
single pulse events such as single pulses from pulsars and
FRBs in conditions of high S/N and low RFI. We there-
fore do not believe that any new algorithm will be able to

The grey dashed vertical line indicates the DM search range by PRESTO, 0–800 pc cm−3 for single-beam and 0–300 pc cm−3 for PAF.

(b) For PAF using PRESTO

improve signiﬁcantly on PRESTO’s ability to detect such
sources (noting that high-DM events will not be found if the
searched DM range is not suﬃcient).

We recommend the development of new algorithms for (1)
data sets signiﬁcantly aﬀected by RFI, both in terms of reduc-
ing false positive events and also in detecting actual events
in the presence of the RFI, (2) narrow-band FRB events or
for pulsars whose scintillation bandwidth is smaller than the
observing bandwidth, (3) signatures of ﬂare stars, and (4)
unexpected signals that do not follow the dispersion law.

The search for the unknown unknowns is challenging. For
bright events (for instance, those that can be seen by eye
in the time-frequency dynamic spectra) numerous methods
exist, including edge detection algorithms, feature extraction
methods, etc. The primary challenge is in identifying a suit-
able scale for the dynamic spectrum being analysed. If the
time-scale being analysed is smaller than the event duration,
or the event width then the detectability of the signal will re-
duce. If the time-scale is much longer than the event duration
then the statistics of the measured data will be dominated by
the radiometer noise and the event likely to be missed.

Weak “unknown unknown” events (those undetectable by
eye in dynamic spectra) will be extremely hard to detect un-

less prior knowledge exists around the possible properties of
the signal, or a detailed understanding exists of the under-
lying noise. We do note that ﬂare star, or similar, events
are likely to exist within our archival data sets (Tang et al.
2022) and therefore recommend searching for linear, as well
as quadratic, frequency-dependent signals.

We have chosen to simulate rare events. By deﬁnition the
data set will therefore have fewer events than “non-events”.
This is also true in the real observations where training data
sets for e.g., FRB events are dominated by RFI, noise etc.
and only a few actual FRBs are present. It is therefore es-
sential that new algorithms can deal with this imbalance and
we explicitly chose to ensure that the injected signals in our
data sets remain rare events. A proper handling of the imbal-
anced classes will likely boost the performance of a classiﬁ-
cation algorithm. Several methods can be used, for example,
resampling the data set to balance the classes when training
a supervised machine learning for classiﬁcation.

We have not explicitly studied how fast PRESTO runs on
these data sets, but future algorithms need to be eﬃcient in
order to process the large data volumes expected from future
surveys. We also note that algorithms that do not rely on

5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION

Here, we have begun to address how current and future tele-
scope high-time resolution surveys can be used to detect
signals that are currently unknown. We have presented our
SPARKESX dataset of Single-dish PARKES for ﬁnding the
uneXpected. The SPARKESX dataset includes three mock
surveys from the Parkes “Murriyang” telescope.

The SPARKESX dataset is designed to aid in the de-
velopment of new search algorithms. Event labels exist al-
lowing new algorithms to be compared against our baseline
PRESTO results. We envision that this data challenge will
useful in the development of advanced statistical, machine
learning, and data analysis techniques. The practicality is not

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2022)

limited to astronomy, but also more broadly across multiple
disciplines, in particular to the analysis of massive data sets.
Our longer-term plan is to use this data challenge in order
to develop both image-processing and machine learning al-
gorithms that can identify anomalies in high-time resolution
data streams. We will compare and test these algorithms with
the SPARKESX data challenge and then apply to archival
Parkes data sets as well as to the future surveys planned us-
ing the new cryogenic PAF that will soon be installed at the
telescope.

SPARKESX Data Challenge

17

The CSV label ﬁles are only a few KB each. The CSV ground
truth labels and PRESTO outputs ﬁles are mainly ∼ 3 MB
except 6 MB for real+combo single-beam. The total ﬁle size
of SPARKESX is 2.34 TB.

A3 Label Information

The columns in the CSV label ﬁles are separated by a comma
(,) delimiter. The label descriptions are listed in Table A2.

A4 Reading the Data

The simulated data sets are in PSRFITS format, the same
data format as actual high-time resolution survey data sets as
recorded by radio telescopes. This implies that any algorithm
that has been developed using SPARKESX can directly be
applied to peta-bytes of real observations available from e.g.,
the Parkes pulsar data archive (Hobbs et al. 2011). However,
this means that new algorithms need to account for the data
format and, in particular, the data quantisation to 1 or 2-
bits. Users of the data challenge may prefer images. Such
data products can be produced once the PSRFITS simulation
ﬁle is loaded using a package to read FITS ﬁle. For example,
in C, using the CFITSIO11 (Pence 1999, 2010) library, but
the user needs to provide their own unpacker. In Python,
the PulsarDataToolbox12 can be used using the function
pdat.psrfits. Note that this (and other similar tools) only
reads bytes from the PSRFITS ﬁles. The user then needs
to extract individual 1- or 2-bit streams from those bytes.
For 1-bit data, this can be carried out using the NumPy
unpackbits routine. For 2-bit data a look-up table or more
complex routine is needed. Tools such as pfits (Hobbs 2021)
and dspsr (van Straten & Bailes 2011) can also be used to
read and process these data ﬁles.

This paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX ﬁle prepared by
the author.

APPENDIX A: SPARKESX INFORMATION

The SPARKESX dataset contains two parts:

(1) The main simulation data and injected real data in

PSRFITS format ﬁles, as described in the paper.

(2) The complementary properties labels of the simulated
events for each PSRFITS ﬁles in comma-separated values (CSV)
format, which are described in Table A2.

In addition, the labels for every frames or the ground truth
are compiled into a CSV format ﬁle for reproducibility of the
results. Essentially, it contains all the properties labels that
are ﬁlled to include non-events as well. The outputs from the
baseline method using PRESTO are also appended in the
same ﬁle. The column information is described in Table A2.
The dataset for SPARKESX can be downloaded from the

CSIRO DAP at https://doi.org/10.25919/fd4f-0g20.

A1 Folder Layout and Filename Convention

The layout of the dataset folder is as follows. It contains three
directories for the diﬀerent surveys, namely single-beam from
multibeam, 13-beams from multibeam, and PAF. Each direc-
tory has 7 for multibeam and 6 for PAF subfolder with the
event groups, and 1 for multibeam 13-beam with real+combo
subfolder. Within it, the main PSRFITS simulation data and
CSV labels are included.

For the PSRFITS, the ﬁle naming convention: <event-

group><+rfi>_<survey>_<index><_realfilename>.sf

• eventgroup: Event groups as listed in Table 2
• +rfi: If simulated RFI is added
• survey: Survey name. sbeam for 1-beam of multibeam,
mbeam for 13-beam of multibeam, and paf for PAF. For
mbeam, additional suﬃx <beam#>_t<mbtype>, where beam# is
the beam number and mbtype is the type of conﬁguration of
the receiver (refer to Section 2.2).

• index: File number
• realfilename: If real observation data is used, the ﬁle-

name of the raw data

For the properties label CSV, the ﬁle naming convention:

<eventgroup>_<survey>_<index>_propparam_label.csv

the

ground truth labels

In the directory gtbaseline_label,

con-
from
taining
PRESTO are stored. Similarly, within it contains direc-
tories for the three surveys, single-beam, 13-beam multi-
beam, and PAF. The ﬁle naming convention: <event-
group>_<survey>_<index>_gtbaseline.csv.

the ﬁles
and outputs

Additionally,

in the directory image_irm, the injected

steganography images are provided for reference.

A2 File Size

A summary of the number of ﬁles and events is listed in
Table A1. The ﬁle size of each PSRFITS for

• 1-beam of multibeam: 49 MB for all event groups except

101 MB for real+combo

• 13-beam of multibeam: 101 MB
