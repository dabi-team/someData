Trends in Workplace Wearable Technologies and
Connected-Worker Solutions for Next-Generation
Occupational Safety, Health, and Productivity

Vishal Patel, Austin Chesmore, Christopher M. Legner, and Santosh Pandey*

The workplace inﬂuences the safety, health, and productivity of workers at
multiple levels. To protect and promote total worker health, smart hardware, and
software tools have emerged for the identiﬁcation, elimination, substitution, and
control of occupational hazards. Wearable devices enable constant monitoring of
individual workers and the environment, whereas connected worker solutions
provide contextual information and decision support. Here, the recent trends in
commercial workplace technologies to monitor and manage occupational risks,
injuries, accidents, and diseases are reviewed. Workplace safety wearables for
safe lifting, ergonomics, hazard identiﬁcation, sleep monitoring, fatigue man-
agement, and heat and cold stress are discussed. Examples of workplace pro-
ductivity wearables for asset tracking, augmented reality, gesture and motion
control, brain wave sensing, and work stress management are given. Workplace
health wearables designed for work-related musculoskeletal disorders, functional
movement disorders, respiratory hazards, cardiovascular health, outdoor sun
exposure, and continuous glucose monitoring are shown. Connected worker
platforms are discussed with information about the architecture, system mod-
ules, intelligent operations, and industry applications. Predictive analytics pro-
vide contextual information about occupational safety risks, resource allocation,
equipment failure, and predictive maintenance. Altogether, these examples
highlight the ground-level beneﬁts of real-time visibility about frontline workers,
work environment, distributed assets, workforce efﬁciency, and safety
compliance.

of the potential risk factors is critical for the
safety, health, and productivity of workers.
For this purpose, employers’ resort to key
enabling technologies (KETs) to monitor,
manage, and optimize their workplace
assets (e.g.,
inventory,
tools, machines,
safety equipment, supporting technologies,
and workers). On one hand, workplace
wearables (i.e., smart, on-body accessories,
and personal protective equipment [PPE])
track the activities, behavior and body sta-
tus of individual workers. On the other
hand, connected worker solutions (i.e.,
intelligent computing, data analytics, and
storage platforms) serve as the central
hub for extracting contextual information
from distributed networks of workplace
wearables for better workﬂow organization,
asset management,
predictive
maintenance.

and

Currently, there are niche applications
for workplace wearables and connected
worker solutions (herein referred to as
workplace technologies) in almost every
industry, be it in agriculture, construction,
retail,
mining, production, healthcare,
warehousing,
transportation,
technology,
or automotive industry. For example, work-
place technologies are being used to detect
awkward work postures, forceful exertions,
vibrations, repetitive tasks, physical fatigue, mental acuity and
stress, mood and emotions, safety compliance, and rest
breaks.[1–5] By building a smart and connected workplace with
human-in-a-loop models, workers today are better equipped with
situational awareness, ﬁeld visibility, and remote supervision.[6–9]
Previous review articles have summarized smart and intelligent
wearables on selected topics and products related to workplace
safety, health, and productivity.[1–9] Most of the information
on latest commercial products and solutions is spread across dif-
ferent websites, news outlets, insight articles, survey reports and
social media.[10–12] This may make it challenging for interested
readers and potential adopters to assimilate the information in a
digestible format and keep abreast with the emerging workplace
technologies, their applications in different worksites, and poten-
tial beneﬁts to the workforce and employers.

Our objective here is to provide a comprehensive review of
commercial wearables and connected worker solutions for occu-
pational safety, health, and productivity (Figure 1). Our intent is

Occupational risks and hazards come from various sources and can adversely affect the workers’ safety, productivity, and health. Workplace wearables
are smart devices worn on the body as accessories or garments to collect data on physiological and environmental conditions. Connected worker solutions
engage the workplace wearables to a centralized hub for data storage, management, analytics, visualization, security, and actions. The vector icons on occu-
pational risks and hazards are reproduced (adapted) with permission from the OSHA website on “Top 10 Most Frequently Cited Standards for Fiscal Year

(GDP). Workplace incidents tarnish the reputation of companies
and cause signiﬁcant ﬁnancial burden (e.g., medical insurance
premiums, worker compensation, litigation costs, lost productiv-
ity, and the costs of hiring and training replacements).[13,14] One
estimate suggests that workplace injuries cost USA companies
more than one billion dollars every week.[15]

Table 1 shows the occupational risks in different industries,
the workers at increased risk, the risk-mitigating interventions,
and PPE commonly used to safeguard workers as compiled from
safety and health reports.[13–16] Speciﬁc work groups are at higher
infections, and diseases.[14] For
risks for certain injuries,
instance, healthcare workers are prone to fatigue, overexertion,
and hospital infection. Ofﬁce workers are susceptible to neck
and back pain, chemical factory workers have greater risks of
respiratory illnesses, and rubber industry workers face an
increased risk of stomach cancer. Hearing loss is commonly
associated with workers

such as those in the military, agricultural and animal farms, con-
struction sites, and wastewater treatment facilities.[21–25]

are the USA. Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the
ILO’s
International Labor Standards of 1919, Canada’s
Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1979, the UK. Health
and Safety at Work Act of 1974, the USA. Mine Safety and
Health Act of 1977, and Australia’s Work Health and Safety
Act of 2011.[29–31] The OSHA Whistleblower Protection Program
protects workers from retaliation by employers when they report
workplace violations.[16]

The employers, particularly the corporate leadership and man-
agement staff, are ultimately responsible for implementing and
adopting the risk-mitigating interventions to ensure a safe and
healthy work climate.[32] For outdoor work activities, employers
may provide standard PPE to their labor workforce, such as steel
toe cap shoes, safety vests, harnesses, hard hats, earmuffs, and
goggles. In this regard, workplace technologies with real-time
data collection and predictive analytics are worthwhile invest-
ments to assess the internal and external workloads of workers
using quantiﬁable metrics and measurable outcomes.[33] In addi-
tion, employers may offer a variety of perks and rewards to posi-
tively inﬂuence the work-life balance of
their employees.
Workplace wellness programs play a vital role in supporting
healthy choices and improving the quality of life of workers to
beneﬁt the employers in the long term.[34] Behavioral and eco-
nomic incentives (such as ﬁtness and yoga instruction, stress
management classes, healthy food canteens, transit options,
employee assistance programs, and worksite health clinics) have
shown to boost the workforce morale.[34] In the case of injuries
and accidents, employers may offer workers compensation ben-
eﬁts, temporary or permanent total disability beneﬁts, social
security disability insurance, and death beneﬁts. To raise global
awareness about the prevention of occupational injuries, acci-
dents and diseases, the ILO World Day for Safety and Health
is observed annually on April 28.[35] The 2020 campaign theme
was the outbreak of infectious diseases at work, and in particular
on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and resume work
activities in a sustainable manner.

3. Wearables for Occupational Safety Monitoring

In this section, the following categories of wearable devices for
monitoring occupational safety are discussed: i) heavy lifting,
ergonomics and lift assists, ii) danger awareness, hazard identi-
ﬁcation, and fatigue risk management, and iii) heat and cold
stress detection. Table 2 shows the commercial devices for mon-
itoring worker safety, companies that produce them, their clas-
siﬁcation, components, and safety applications. Figure 2 shows
examples of wearable technology products for monitoring occu-
pational safety.

3.1. Heavy Lifting, Ergonomics, and Lift Assists

Lifting heavy objects can lead to back sprains, muscle pulls, and
injuries in the wrist, elbow, or spinal cord.[36–38] Workers
encounter heavy lifting activities in several workplaces, including
those in construction, manufacturing, warehousing, retail, and
transportation. Several agricultural activities from plantation to
harvesting require heavy lifting and repetitive tasks.[39] Within
the healthcare service industry, emergency medical services

(EMS) workers routinely encounter situations in which they
must
lift prehospitalized patients, resulting in overexertion
and bodily reactions (i.e., sprains and strains). According to
the NIOSH, heavy lifting is the most common cause of occupa-
tional injuries for these EMS workers.[40]

Wearables for ergonomic hazards can detect awkward work-
ing postures during heavy lifting (e.g., awkward bending, reach-
ing, gripping, and repetitive lifting events) and provide real-time
safety alerts to correct the wearer’s posture.[41] For example, the
kinetic reﬂex is a smart wearable device worn on a belt or waist-
band to detect high-risk postures in industrial workers.[42] The
kinetic device uses motion sensors and biomechanical analysis
to provide real-time vibrational feedback. The kinetic reﬂex wear-
able and software analytics platform is used for injury reduction
at the workplace by automatically detecting unsafe biomechanics
at work (e.g., bending, twisting, and overreaching) that could
eventually lead to injury. A continuous coaching with light vibra-
tion is provided to workers, along with alerts, goals, and rewards
to create and sustain new behavior or habits. Kinetic estimates
that its technology can reduce potentially unsafe postures by
84%, thereby preventing lifting injuries commonly encountered
in shipping, packaging, and last mile delivery of goods. A report
by Perr&Knight, a top USA actuarial consulting ﬁrm, found that
the use of kinetic reﬂex wearable technology resulted in 50–60%
reduction of injury frequency (i.e., frequency of strain and sprain
claims) and 72% reduction of lost work days.

Lift assists, such as exoskeletons and exosuits, have proved
vital for heavy and repetitive lifting encountered in industrial
jobs. Exoskeletons act as mechanical extensions of the wearer
to assist in a range of motions while providing ergonomic beneﬁt
and reduced muscle strain.[43,44] The following are examples of
exoskeletons designed for upper body ergonomics:

The StrongArm ErgoSkeleton lift assist system is a workplace
the “industrial athlete.”[45] The
safety vest designed for
StrongArm fuse platform uses a risk monitoring device to collect
data on the body sagittal motion, twist motion, and lateral
motion.[46] Machine learning (ML) algorithms evaluate safety
risks, and alert the user via haptic feedback. The StrongArm
ErgoSkeleton is used to reduce arm fatigue, transfer the load
from the upper body to the legs, reduce strain and injuries to
the lower back, and inculcate proper lifting techniques at the
workplace. A safety score is maintained for every worker to pro-
vide a holistic view of the safety situation for every facility, job
shift, and job function.

The Levitate Technologies AirFrame wearable harness is used
to ﬁght fatigue in workers’ upper extremities and improve upper
extremity musculoskeletal health, especially in jobs that require
repetitive arm movement or static elevation of the arms.[47] The
wearable harness transfers the weight of the arms from the
shoulders and upper body to the hips and body core, thereby
reducing stress and injury to the arm. The AirFrame is automati-
cally activated as the arm is raised and is deactivated as the arm is
lowered. The harness is purely mechanical and operates by a sys-
tem of pulleys and cables, thus requiring no electrical power. In a
signiﬁcant milestone for the exoskeleton industry, the Toyota’s
Woodstock plant has made the AirFrame suit a mandatory PPE
for its workers in the welding shop, recognizing the risks of work-
ing overhead as a key contributor to musculoskeletal injuries.

Paexo from Ottobock and Skelex 360 from Skelex have been
tested by Audi, the German automaker, to assist with overhead
and above-shoulder jobs in its assembly, toolmaking and paint
shops at the Ingolstadt site.[48] These exoskeletons are designed
as backpacks and have arm shell structures that absorb some of
the weight of the arms and redistribute it to the hips and thighs
of the wearer. The exoskeletons help to reduce physical strain and
protect the musculoskeletal system during a variety of overhead
or above-shoulder activities, such as electrical or mechanical
installations, structural assembly, engine repairs, welding of
metallic framework, riveting activities maintenance work, pre-
treatment/sanding/paint coating, foil application etc.

The Noonee Chairless Chair is an exoskeleton worn at the
back of the legs by assembly line workers.[49] The exoskeleton
structure has surfaces that support the buttocks and thighs,
and two struts that contour to the shape of the legs. The
Noonee Chairless Chair allows the user to sit dynamically and
switch effortlessly between sitting, standing, and walking activi-
ties in industrial production, picking, and assembly lines. This

promotes ergonomic posture and relieves strain from the legs,
knees, and ankles.

The Sarcos Robotic Guardian XO is a full-body exoskeleton
that assists with repetitive lifting, heavy lifting, and long dura-
tions of physical activity.[50] Some use cases of the Sarcos
Guardian XO in assembly and manufacturing (e.g., unload boxes
and crates, manipulate parts and heavy tools, welding, and kitting
industrial equipment), construction (e.g., moving, installing, dis-
mantling, and lifting heavy tools and equipment), and aviation
(e.g., minimize risks of stress/strain from physically demanding
jobs). The Sarcos Guardian XO suit ampliﬁes the operator
strength up to 20 times (with a maximum payload of
200 pounds). The SuitX MAX ﬂexible exoskeleton series is spe-
cially adapted to reduce the muscle force of the lower back, shoul-
der, and legs.[51] They are designed to reduce muscle strain,
reduce risk of injury, and improve the quality of life. There
are three modules (backX, shoulderX, and legX) that can func-
tion independently or in unison to reduce the strain on body
joints. The shoulderX module reduces shoulder fatigue when

arms are raised during above-shoulder work, the backX module
reduces back fatigue during a bending position, and the legX
module reduces thigh fatigue during a squatted position. The
following are examples of exoskeletons designed for hand
ergonomics:

The Bioservo Ironhand soft exoskeleton glove enhances the
gripping strength of the hand while using less grip force.
An embedded processor calculates the needed force, and then
the artiﬁcial tendons apply the extra force.[52] The glove consists
of sensors in all ﬁve ﬁngers that adjust the applied force and bal-
ance between ﬁngers. This feature reduces strain injuries and
fatigue during tasks involving intensive grasping actions. The
glove is always connected by 4G using an in-built sim card or
WiFi. The battery life is (cid:1)6–8 h and the weight is around
6 pounds (or 2.75 kg). The Bioservo Ironhand is used as a pre-
ventive ergonomic measure to reduce incidents of hand-related

repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) at the workplace. Some use cases
of the Bioservo Ironhand are in preassembly (e.g., manual
maneuvering of the hoist), assembly (e.g., pressing in, clipping,
and compressing), logistics (e.g., lifting and carrying off parts),
warehousing (e.g., lifting, holding, and carrying boxes), and con-
struction (e.g., grip-intensive and repetitive tasks).

The RoboGlove is a robotic grasping wearable assist technol-
and Space
ogy developed by
Administration (NASA) and General Motors. It is used to help
assembly line operators working long hours and performing
repetitive tasks, and could be applied in a variety of markets from
manufacturing to medical rehabilitation.[53] The RoboGlove
reduces the gripping force needed while operating a tool and
has pressure sensors at the ﬁngertips to detect when an object
is ready to be grasped. Synthetic tendons then retract to bring
the RoboGlove ﬁngers into a gripping position. The object is

released when the gripping action is relaxed. The RoboGlove is
now licensed to Bioservo that has developed its own Soft Extra
Muscle Glove.[54]

3.2. Danger Awareness, Hazard Identiﬁcation, and Fatigue Risk
Management

Workers can be subject to unpredicted dangers and hazards,
such as when bypassing safeguards during heavy machinery
operations.[55,56] Supervisors need to ensure that workers are
immediately aware of potential dangers to avoid accidents.[57]
Using wearables, workers can inform their supervisors about
their location, fatigue levels, health status, and the surrounding
environment. This digital connectivity and data transparency
allow supervisors to remotely observe workers, check for safety
compliance, assess potential dangers, and send timely alerts or
requests for help. The following are examples of workplace wear-
ables for danger awareness, hazard identiﬁcation, and accident
prevention:

Guardhat integrates sensors into a smart hard hat (certiﬁed
ANSI.Z89.14 Type I Class-G industrial hardhat) to monitor mul-
tiple parameters, such as altitude, proximity, falls, noise, gas,
temperature, and pressure.[58] Guardhat has different multime-
dia options (light emitting diodes (LEDs), audio speakers, micro-
phones, 13MP camera, push-to-talk (PTT), voice over internet
protocol (VoIP), and Video Uplink), maximum weight (with sus-
pension) of 800 gm, battery capacity of 4800 mAh (typically 8-
12 h), and a 3D location accuracy of up to 1 m. Its Real-time
Location System has the ability to locate assets, personnel,
and sensors with submeter resolution to alert onsite personnel
of operating equipment and hazardous or restricted zones. Real-
time indoor and outdoor location tracking is performed using the
Global Positioning System (GPS)/global navigation satellite sys-
tem (GNSS) technology. Asset identiﬁcation, proximity detec-
tion, and presence detection are enabled using Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) beacons and radio frequency identiﬁcation
(RFID)
technology. The Real-time Situational Awareness
System provides situational context to human–machine interac-
tions to make immediate decisions, prevent accidents, and
improve critical response metrics. The Guardhat is used to detect
proximity to hazardous locations and moving equipment, pro-
vide early warning for potential exposure to hazmat or environ-
mental conditions, monitor the lone worker or the driver/
machine operator remotely, monitor access control at restricted
areas (e.g., lockouts, geofencing, zone marking etc.), check and
remind workers for wearing the correct PPE, and provide emer-
gency response or evacuation notiﬁcations in a timely manner.
The Scan-Link Armor RFID System is designed to be attached
to safety vests and hard hats.[59] The Scan-Link system consists of
an antenna unit, display, beeper alarm, mounting bracket, and
safety apparel. Its RFID tags in the antenna unit is used to alert
the mobile equipment operator (e.g., drivers and ground work-
ers) about the presence of persons (e.g., other ground workers,
contractors, and visitors) and danger zones in the construction
site within a wide range from the operator (25–30 feet behind
and 13 feet across). The antenna unit records the date/time
and apparel ID of every detection event, and this information
is used by the system to self-learn and reduce false alarms.

The available frequencies for the antenna unit are 902.3–927.7,
920–926, and 865.7–867.5 MHz. One unique feature of the
system is that, rather than detecting objects (e.g., gravel, sand
piles, safety cones, and safety barriers), the Scan-Link RFID tags
can detect and differentiate only persons in the vicinity, alerting
the mobile operator to exercise caution. The Scan-Link technolo-
gies have been used in various industries (e.g., oil and gas, con-
struction, waste, forestry, aggregate, and municipal) to increase
safety practices and be compliant of safety regulations at the
workplace.

The Honeywell BioHarness physiological monitoring system
supports wearable sensors that measure users’ heart rate
(0–240 beats per minute), breath rate (0–120 breaths per minute),
temperature (10–60 (cid:3)C), activity ((cid:4)16 Vector Magnitude Units),
posture (0 to 180 degrees), and location.[60] Its RAELink3 is a
portable wireless transmitter that allows real-time data viewing
within a 2 mile radius, whereas its ProRAE Guardian software
provides continuous information on the location and health
status of remote workers. Its RFID tags can be attached to
any Honeywell safety equipment to track its location, its usage,
and maintenance performed by ﬁeld personnel such as ﬁre-
ﬁghters, ﬁrst responders or factory workers. The Honeywell
BioHarness provides a quick assessment of worker’s health
status on the ﬁeld so that work levels can be modiﬁed to mitigate
potential health risks (such as heat stress) from hazardous
atmospheres.

The Triax Technologies Spot-r platform provides real-time vis-
ibility on the location, utilization, and safety of both workers and
equipment.[61] The Spot-r Clip is a clip-on device worn by work-
ers to automatically transmit information about their location
(e.g., ﬂoor and shop), attendance (e.g., check-in and check-
out), and safety compliance. The clip-on device automatically
detects falls, informs supervisors about the nature of falls, and
calls for emergency help through the Spot-r network. The
Spot-r EquipTag provides information about
the equipment
(e.g., its location, operator, and usage) to its network to manage
idle time, the number of hours logged in, and operational use.
The Spot-r EquipTags, POI tags, and dashboard have been used
in oil and gas reﬁneries, construction sites, and heavy industrial
facilities for site visibility (active and occupied sites), worker/site
safety (high volume trafﬁc monitoring, lone worker check-ins,
and conﬁned spaces), site security (restricted area monitoring),
and automated identiﬁcation of productivity gains (productive
versus unproductive areas, and workplace bottlenecks) at the
work site

Reactec has developed a managed service solution for the
exposure to Hand Arm Vibrations (HAV) while operating
machinery.[62] Its Razor device captures data from multiple risk
exposure sensors (e.g., vibration, noise, gas, and dust) housed in
its HAVwear watches. The Havwear watch has a 17 mm LCD
lithium-ion rechargeable battery, 1000 full charging
screen,
cycles, up to 12–36 h battery life with Bluetooth enabled, memory
to store up to 202 data records, and 13.56 MHz data communi-
cation module. The HAVCare service conducts HAV risk assess-
ments, exposure monitoring, and risk control appraisals through
HAV consultants. The Reactec Analytics Platform provides
actionable insights to support lone workers or remote supervi-
sors with sound and vibratory alert signals when the risk expo-
sure thresholds are reached. The Reactec HAVwear is used to

track the tool usage, calculate and display daily exposure points,
send alerts when the daily exposure values have exceeded, gen-
erate reports on worker daily exposure and interventions, record
the effectiveness of controls and real-time risk assessment.

3M Technologies is a leading manufacturer of a wide range of
smart PPE, safety vests and harnesses, lifeline systems, protec-
tive coveralls, protective eyewear, electronic earmuffs, and partic-
ulate respirators.[63] Their PPE products are used within the
subject areas of fall protection, ﬁreﬁghters and ﬁrst responder
safety, head and face protection, hearing protection and commu-
nication, protective eyewear, respiratory protection, welding
safety, etc. The 3M DBI-SALA Smart Lock Connected SRL
technology is integrated in several PPE gadgets, and uses
Bluetooth-enabled sensors for incident reporting, compliance,
and inventory management. The 3M Connected PPE system pro-
vides actionable insights to workers and managers about the cur-
rent conditions and historical usage of the PPE gadgets. Together,
the 3M Connected Safety Solutions are designed to improve
worker safety, safety compliance, and safety process automation.
AerNos has developed a range of smart nano gas sensors used
to detect hazardous gases, gas leaks, volatile organic compounds,
and air pollutants.[64] Its AerSIP is a 5 (cid:5) 5 mm2 System-in-
Package (SiP) component that combines a microelectromechan-
ical (MEMS) nanosensing module and a mixed-signal application
speciﬁc integrated circuit (ASIC) module. Its AerBand is a wear-
able band used to monitor air pollutants with parts per billion
sensitivity and is customizable for speciﬁc gases (e.g., formalde-
hyde, nitrogen oxides, methane, and ozone). The AerBand pro-
vides a personal 24/7 monitoring of the air quality, pollutants,
and other gases both indoor and outdoor to evaluate the efﬁcacy
of pollutants’ exposure reduction strategies. The AerNos AerIoT
and AerBand Data Cloud Platform & Auto API can be used to
store and manage all the recorded data for 24/7 industrial safety
monitoring.

To avoid dangerous situations from physical fatigue, a cate-
gory of smart shoes and insoles has emerged for fatigue risk
management that track changes in user’s movement, posture
and coordination.[65] The following are examples of smart shoes
and insoles for the outdoor workplace.

The SolePower Work Boots are designed to monitor the work-
er’s exertion, location and environment in real time.[66] The boots
incorporate low power sensors with the capability to send data to
the cloud. The mechanical compression of the sole from walking
steps is leveraged to power the electronics, and the stored energy
can be scavenged in a resource-limited setting. The SolePower
boots have been used by industrial workers, military personnel,
and ﬁrst responders to measure fatigue, provide emergency
alerts, improve situational awareness, and enhance transparency
about the workforce.

The Arion Smart Shoe Insoles and Footpods are used to mon-
itor the wearer’s body posture, movement, and running tech-
longer, and safer.[67]
nique to eventually let you run faster,
`The ﬂexible smart insoles are just 2 mm thin, and laden with
eight pressure-sensitive sensors to track parameters related to
the user’s balance, stability, cadence, foot strike, step length, con-
tact time, and ﬂight time. The battery life of the insoles is up to
7 h of run time. The Arion coaching engine provides real-time
audio feedback to spread the loading of the body, correct the
wearer’s posture, and reduce injury. In addition, StryD and

RunVi recently launched smart insoles with biomechanical sen-
sors and real-time adaptive coaching to analyze the movement
dynamics and avoid injury.

3.3. Heat and Cold Stress Detection

Exposure to extreme temperatures is a major concern for outdoor
workers, such as emergency responders, police and law enforce-
ment ofﬁcers, sanitation workers, snow removal crews, and those
used in cold storage warehouses or meat packaging plants. The
risk factors for hypothermia (body temperature <95 (cid:3)F) are
exposure to cold temperatures, poor physical conditioning,
exhaustion, lack of sufﬁcient warm protective clothing, or predis-
posing health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyper-
tension, trauma, or consumption of drugs or illicit alcohol).[68,69]
Hypothermia leads to symptoms such as shivering, slow pulse
and breathing, slurred speech, exhaustion, and lack of coordina-
tion.[70–72] Prolonged exposure to cold stress can result in frost
bite, trench foot, and chilblains.[73–75] On the other hand, the risk
factors for hyperthermia (body temperature >100.4 (cid:3)F) are hot
and humid environments, overexertion and excessive workload,
thyroid storm, hypothalamic hemorrhage, toxic ingestions, pre-
disposing health conditions (e.g., hypertension, dehydration,
being over- or underweight, or consumption of alcohol or illicit
drugs). Hyperthermia leads to symptoms such as headache, nau-
sea, fatigue, dehydration, excessive sweating, muscle cramps,
rapid breathing, vomiting, and mental confusion. In extreme
cases, hyperthermia can result in heat stroke, hallucinations,
seizures, and coma.[76–80]

Devices for monitoring the skin temperature include glass
thermometers, infrared thermometers, thermal imagers, and
wearables. While most wearables are capable of monitoring
the skin temperature in a continuous and unobtrusive manner,
it is challenging to measure the core body temperature in the
same manner. By integrating biometrics and data analytics to
estimate core body temperature, employers can remotely assess
the heat or cold stress levels of their workers and take the neces-
sary preventive measures. The following are examples of work-
place wearables for detecting heat and cold stress.

Medtronic Zephyr has developed the Zephyr Performance
System as the premier biometric device for human performance
monitoring.[81] Using proprietary technology, Zephyr is able to
derive physiological and biomechanical measurements to gain
insights with more actionable data to assess performance and
safety of an individual or a group. The chest-mounted Zephyr
Biomodule collects over 100 data points per second of triaxial
accelerometry and samples ECG heart
rate from 250 to
1000 Hz. Up to 450 h of data can be collected on up to 100 sub-
jects simultaneously for each Biomodule. The Biomodule can
communicate up to 400 yards with the Zephyr Omnisense
software and transmit data to a cloud-based server for either
in-person or remote surveillance. The Omnisense software
can translate this raw data into actionable information such as
Heart Rate, Breathing Rate, Heart Rate Variability/ Stress,
Estimate Core Body Temperature, Caloric Burn, or Impact
Data. The Omnisense Software has over 30 parameters for
review, along with customizable and automated reporting func-
tionality. These reports and measurements can be used in a

variety of environments and in many ways to achieve greater
results,
improve safety, and reduce the risk of injury. The
Zephyr ECHO communication system transmits up to 200
yards—and up to 400 yards when used with ﬁeld repeaters.
The Zephyr technology has been used by professional and colle-
giate sports teams, military, NASA, ﬁrst responders, and for
industrial applications such as mining, oil ¯and gas, and
construction.

Kenzen offers the Kenzen Patch to monitor physiological
parameters associated with heat stress such as heart rate with
multi-LED PPG sensor, core body temperature, worker microcli-
mate and sweat rate, body temperature, motion metrics, and
activity levels.[82] The Kenzen Monitor is worn on the torso or
upper arm and provides regular feedback on vital signs and per-
formance with health insights. The Kenzen Team Dashboard dis-
plays data on the entire team. The Kenzen Safety Intelligence
generates safety reports based on alerts, actions taken, and ﬂags
captured. Kenzen solutions help to predict and prevent heat-
related injuries and illnesses by identifying high-risk workers,
adjusting shift times, calculating optimal work–rest cycles, allow-
ing workers to improve their health indicators, and training
teams to look forward to possible heat-related injuries. Their
technology is used to improve worker safety in a variety of work-
place settings including nursing, emergency services, oil and gas,
reﬁnery, construction, power generation, renewable energy, and
mining.

The Equivital EQ LifeMonitor system integrates sensors that
measure the wearer’s position/movement, activity, oxygen satu-
ration, respiratory rate, and respiratory waveforms, ECG wave-
forms, heart rate, R–R interval, galvanic skin response, and
skin temperature.[83] The 8 Gb memory allows for up to 50 days
of continuous logging of physiological data, and the battery life is
up to 48 h. The Equivital BlackHost Monitoring System enables
mobile human monitoring of the entire team in challenging and
hazardous conditions. The Equivital system has been deployed in
ﬁeld studies involving ﬁrst responders, military personnel,
industrial workers, and academic researchers. The Equivital sys-
tem has been used to track multiple vital signs around the clock
with applications in remote health monitoring (e.g., for heat
stress prevention, sleep research, sports monitoring, optimized
team training, military training, and bio-feedback). It is possible
to seamlessly integrate third-party devices such as the Nonin oxy-
gen saturation probes, VitalSense dermal patch, and the
VitalSense and BodyCAP core temperature capsules.

North Star BlueScope Steel, a global steel producer and sup-
plier to Australia and North America, embeds different IBM sen-
sors in helmets and wristbands to monitor ground workers’ skin
body temperature, heart rate, and activity in real time.[84] The
IBM’s Employee Wellness and Safety Solution uses cognitive
computing through its IBM Watson technology to generate cus-
tomized safety guidelines on when and how to avoid heat stress
and exertion, especially if temperatures rise to unsafe limits.

Monitoring

In this section, the following categories of wearable devices for
i) Asset
monitoring occupational productivity are discussed:

tracking and social behavior monitoring, ii) AR and VR, iii) ges-
ture and motion control, and iv) mental acuity, brain-wave sens-
ing, and occupational stress management. Table 3 shows the
commercial devices for monitoring worker productivity, the com-
panies that produce them, their classiﬁcation, components, and
applications. Figure 3 shows examples of wearable technology
products for monitoring occupational productivity.

4.1. Asset Tracking and Social Behavior Monitoring

Rugged and lightweight wearables are indispensable for tracking
assets and the workforce in warehouses, grocery stores,
manufacturing sites, factory ﬂoors, ﬁeld stations, and even the
battleﬁeld. The following are examples of workplace wearables
for tracking physical goods and managing inventory.

The Rufus Ring, Rufus ScanGlove Barcode Scanner, and
Rufus Cuff Pro are used to enable faster barcode scanning
and inventory tracking.[85] The Rufus Cuff Pro is a wearable com-
puter supported by Android 9 and has a 5.5 in. display with over
12 h battery life. The Rufus WorkHero is the centralized dash-
board for productivity analytics to optimize workﬂows, reduce
costs, and lower liabilities. The Rufus WorkHero is used to track
parameters such as pickup rates, activity levels, tasks completed,
and labor costs. This improves the workers’ visibility to ware-
house operations and reduces the pick speed and labor costs
by up to 55%. The working range for omnidirectional scanning
is around 20 feet or 6 m. Third-party logistics software (e.g.,
Enterprise Resource Planning [ERP], workﬂow Resource
Planning [WRP],
and Oracle NetSuites)
systems,
can seamlessly connect with the Rufus WorkHero using a
mobile app.

ligent print solutions, and management of employee health and
safety.

With the work-from-home culture during the COVID-19 pan-
demic, there has been a surge in surveillance tools for remotely
monitoring the workers’ activities.[97] Common surveillance
methods for ofﬁce desk workers include keystroke logging,
instant messages monitoring, screen monitoring, user action
alerts, location tracking, webcam surveillance, and remote con-
trol takeover. Some of the rapidly growing providers of employee

surveillance tools are Time Doctor, FlexiSPY, Hubstaff,
DeskTime, ActivTrak, Teramind, SpyEra, WorkTime, and
Kickidler.[97] Recently, Microsoft released a Productivity Score
feature for its Ofﬁce 365 to analyze the amount of time a user
spends on its software (e.g., MS Outlook and Team).[98]
Microsoft has stated that this opt-in feature will provide insights
on how people and teams use its technology and infrastructure.
However, privacy advocates have raised concerns about this con-
troversial feature as it appears to be a remote surveillance tool for
monitoring worker activity at an individual level.[98]

Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2, Microsoft HoloLens 2,
Vuzix M400, RealWear HMT-1, Epson Moverio BT-350, and
Toshiba DynaEdge DE-100. The following are application exam-
ples of where AR/VR smart glasses have been used to boost
productivity.

The Google Glass has been used by employees at Boeing and
Tesla to receive complex instructions in their assembly plants
and accelerate their production using voice, graphics, and
gesture-controlled interactions.[99,100] Boeing employees install
complex electrical wirings for airplanes using hands-free, inter-
active 3D representations of wiring models shown by Google
Glass. Such installation would otherwise be tedious and error-
prone using 2D drawings. Google Glass has been used for a
variety of industrial applications, such as to monitor the plant
processes or path feed rates, real-time calibrations and fault
checks, view and send alarms/messages, and share/capture/
store live streaming videos or still images. The Google Glass
Enterprise Edition 2 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR1 (up to
1.7 GHz), Android Oreo, 8MP 80(cid:3) ﬁeld-of-view camera, three
beam-forming microphones, 3 Gb LPDDR4, 820 mAh battery,
6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope, USB Type-C port, and
on-head detection sensors.

DHL Supply Chain has used AR smart glasses (i.e., Google
Glass, Vuzix M100 and M300 and UbiMax software) for its
“Vision Picking Program” initiative.[101,102] The AR smart glasses
has been used by DHL for hands-free barcode scanning, voice
recognition, pickup location display, single and multiunit pick-
ing, best pick path recommendation, visual guidance through
picking and kitting tasks, and heads-up display with an intuitive
display. All of this has positively affected the DHL supply chain
including warehouse planning, freight loading, transportation,
completeness checks, dynamic trafﬁc support, and parcel loading
or drop-off.[103]

Pick-by-Vision solutions has been developed by Picavi. Its
smart glasses (i.e., Glass Enterprise Edition, and Vuzix M300)
and Picavi Power Control has been used for faster and more reli-
able material ﬂow by providing guided object picking in ware-
houses to ensure efﬁcient intralogistics and minimum error
rate.[104] The Picavi ecosystem has a unique feature of push
notiﬁcations with prioritization of messages which allows bidi-
rectional, contactless, and individual communication between
the ﬂoor worker/picker and the staff in the control room. This
facilitates to report any problems, reprioritize operations, and
correct any actions without much delay.

The Voxware AR brings a voice management solution to boost
agility, efﬁciency and productivity in distribution centers.[105]
Voxware combines the AR vision technologies of smart glasses
with voice and scanning features to automate the workﬂow in
distribution centers, including the picking, packing, cycle count-
ing, returns and receiving, put-away of inventory, and real-time
supervisory monitoring. The VoxPilot Analytics platform aggre-
gates Voxware data to provide real-time visibility and insights
into future events. The VoxPilot platform has been used to opti-
mize inventory positions,
increase traceability of packages,
streamline their predictive analytics, and eventually produce a
10–15% increase in productivity.

Daqri has developed the Daqri Smart Glasses that work with a
suite of AR productivity tools within the Daqri WorkSense plat-
form. The smart glasses consist of multiple cameras (depth sen-
sor camera, color camera, and AR tracking camera), and is used
by the wearer to upload 3D models, navigate around them, and
zoom in/out at the wearer’s own pace with precise positional
tracking and reliable interactions with the surroundings.
The Daqri Smart Helmet is an Android-based hard helmet with
AR-driven smart assistance features used by industrial workers
for the visualization of instructions, training and supervision,
video capture, 3D mapping, and real-time alerts.

The Raptor Smart glasses by Everysight employs AR to make
their users aware of their outdoor surroundings, display routes
for real-time navigation, and record videos with customizable
audio inputs.[106] The smart glasses use a combination of ﬁve dif-
ferent sensors, a Qualcomm SnapDragon 410E processor, 16 or
32 Gb memory, and proprietary BEAM display technology to
project an added AR information layer to the wearer. There
are options to connect with other Bluetooth or BLE-enabled sen-
sors such as heart rate monitor, power meter, and speed sensors.
The smart glass weighs (cid:1)98 g or 3.5 ounces, and a full charge can
give around 8 h of ride time. Additional favorable features of the
Raptor Smart glasses for outdoor work activities are their aero-
dynamic design, smartphone connectivity, light and dark tint
visor, protection against high mass/velocity impacts, and total
privacy.

4.3. Gesture and Motion Control

such as

Gesture and motion control wearables offer hands-free interac-
tions with the digital world to enable AI-driven complex 3D func-
tionalities
remote control of AR/VR machines,
mechanical or surgical robots, mobile payments, biometrics,
assembly lines, retail business, sign language interpretation,
medical-assistive living, and 3D animation. Robotic actions are
enabled are detecting various hand or ﬁnger gestures such as
arm stiffening, ﬁst clenching, hand rotation, wrist ﬂexion and
extension. Typical benchmarks used to compare different devices
in this category are price, compatibility (Linux, Mac, Windows),
wireless connectivity (2.4 GHz), degrees of freedom (6–10), hands
freedom, left- and right-hand operations, gesture recognition,
voice control, battery life, programmable function keys, SDK
(Arduino, Python), and pairing with multiple devices. Examples
of wearables of gesture and motion control are as follows.

The Tactigon Skin device is essentially a 3D wearable mouse
that recognizes voice commands and the gestures of hand and
ﬁngers. It is used to remotely control the functions of mechanical
robots, drones, rovers, AR/VR computers, 3D CAD design and
presentation workﬂow, and 3D printers.[107] It
incorporates
sensors (three-axis accelerometer,
three-axis gyroscope, and
three-axis magnetometer) that detect linear and angular hand
movements, and uses artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) to convert them
into actions for digital machines. The Tactigon ONE is an
Arduino-compatible microcontroller board that can be further
programmed by the user to implement new gesture and motion
control features. There are over 48 complex gestures and hand
movements that can be recognized by the Tactigon Skin,

including gestures to grab close/open, stretch in/out, forward/
backward, up/down, roll right/left. Pitch up/down etc.

The Myo Gesture Control Armband by Thalmic Labs is
designed to control digital technologies using hand gestures.[108]
The Myo armband has sensors that detect hand movements and
the electrical activity of hand muscles. The incorporated sensors
to sense motion in any direction are a three-axis gyroscope,
three-axis accelerometer, and three-axis magnetometer. There
are eight medical-grade electromyography (EMG) sensors. The
detected hand gestures are used to generate appropriate control
signals for digital tools and gadgets such as prosthetic forearms,
AR drones, and VR gaming consoles. Some speciﬁc gestures
enabled by the Myo armband are double tap (to enable or disable
mouse movements), wave in or wave out (to zoom in or zoom out
of the object), spread ﬁngers (go to the next object), and ﬁst
(rotate an object by arm movement, and enable or disable
rotation mode).

Xsens has a number of products related to full-body human
motion capture systems.[109] The Xsens MVN Animate and
Xsens MTw Awinda incorporate wireless inertial sensor modules
to track the positions of multiple actors in real time with time-
synchronized data sampling (of within 10 μm). Xsens Sensor
Fusion algorithms work with the Attitude and Heading
Reference System and Inertial Navigation System to determine
the 3D orientation and relative position after compensating for
gravity and Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. The Xsens MVN Analyze soft-
ware platform integrates the incoming data streams from motion
capture systems for easy visualization in real-time. The Xsens
products are used to create 3D animations and visual effects
(VFX) effects for movies, gaming, TV broadcasting, and live enter-
tainment. They are also applied in performance science, injury
prevention, biomechanical modeling, and workplace ergonomics.

4.4. Mental Acuity, Brain-Wave Sensing, and Occupational
Stress Management

The work-related risk factors for poor mental acuity are occupa-
tional stress, work shifts, irregular working hours, bright lights,
odors, and noise.[110] These risk factors can also stem from job
insecurity, competition, low psychosocial support, low decision-
making latitude, demanding job proﬁle, and work-life imbal-
ance.[111] Consequently, productivity can be compromised with
risks of
injuries, errors, absenteeism, and irregular atten-
dance.[112,113] The following are examples of brain-wave sensing
headbands for improving workers’ mental acuity.

The Muse 2 headband is a compact electroencephalography
(EEG) system that assists in the art of mental focus.[114] The mul-
tisensor Muse headband detects and measures brain electrical
activity and provides real-time feedback on body performance
(i.e., movement, heart rate, sleep activity, and mental activity).
It has a weight of 41 g, LED indicator, micro-USB for charging,
gold/silver sensors, comfort-ﬁt fabric (90% Raylon, 5% Nylon,
and 5% Spandex), and a rechargeable lithium-ion battery (10 h
battery life). The Muse Direct App uses ML to decompose the
raw brain-wave data into understandable components such as
oscillations, transients, noise, and event-driven responses. The
Muse app makes it possible to listen to streaming brain activity
in the form of audio clips or immersive soundscapes.

Melon has designed a smart headband with a mobile app to
track the mental focus during any activity with respect to one’s
emotions, behavior, and surroundings.[115] Melon’s headband
consists of a wireless brain-sensing device that measures EEG
signals and correlates them with brain activity. Melon’s head-
band incorporates a EEG monitoring chip from NeuroSky that
has expertise in EEG signal ampliﬁcation, electrical noise reduc-
tion, and ﬁltering techniques.[116] The Melon mobile app uses
algorithms to quantify focus and provides personalized feedback
on ways to improve focus during activities at work, study or play.
Melon’s headband technology was acquired by Daqri that plans
to integrate the EEG monitoring technology into their smart hel-
mets built with AR capabilities.

The wireless EEG headset by IMEC is capable of detecting
emotions and attention at real-time.[117] The headset comes with
pre-ﬁtted dry electrodes to record the brain’s electrical activity,
whereas its built-in software helps to visualize brain-wave
signals. This clinical-grade IMEC headset is used to improve cog-
nitive abilities through remote sensory stimulation and VR-based
treatment of cognitive conditions (e.g., autism and attention-def-
icit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)).

SmartCap Technologies has developed a LifeBand device to
measure mental fatigue and preventing microsleep at work.[118]
The LifeBand device is attached to a headwear (e.g., helmet, cap,
or beanie) to record brain waves and infer the alertness or mental
fatigue levels. Its fatigue speedometer and brain-wave monitor-
ing band are suitable for road transport drivers, pilots, train
drivers, miners, and machine operators.

In addition to brain-wave sensing, alternative measurements
are being sought to monitor and manage occupational stress, for
example, by sensing electrodermal activity and respiratory
patterns as discussed here.[119] a) Pip has developed a ﬁnger-
wearable electrodermal activity monitoring device for stress
monitoring and management.[120] The skin pores at the ﬁnger-
tips are sensitive to stress, and the Pip device captures this stress-
related variation by monitoring the electrodermal activity at our
ﬁngertips. Stressful events can trigger several physiological
changes, including the sweat gland activity that is picked up
by the Pip device. My Pip and other companion apps allow
the user to visualize the changing stress levels, suggest relaxation
sessions to externalize the body stress, compare your progress
over time, and store personal data on a cloud platform that com-
plies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act
(HIPAA). b) The Focus Wearable clip-on device by
TinyLogics Foci helps to better visualize the current state of mind
by monitoring respiration.[121] Foci technology uses motion sen-
sors to detect tiny movements in breathing and employs ML algo-
rithms to correlate the breathing patterns with cognitive states of
mind. The Foci app uses advanced emotion recognition and
emotion elicitation models to display the state of mind
(categorized as relaxed, fatigue, or stressed) and suggests ways
to tune out distractions, terminate procrastination, sustain longer
focus, and acquire a balanced psychological ﬂow.

The next frontier in occupational stress management lies in
building personalized models with appropriate baselines of clin-
ical disorders and pre-existing conditions. This is because phys-
iological stress response (both type and magnitude) strongly
varies across individuals as suggested by a large stress detection
study involving 1002 individuals and conducted over ﬁve

consecutive days.[122] In addition to occupational stress, sleep is
another important determinant of cognitive failures and reduced
mental acuity in the workplace.[123,124] While polysomnography
(PSG) is more accurate than actigraphy, most consumer wear-
ables (i.e., smartwatches and smart rings) are sufﬁcient to moni-
tor daily sleep attributes.[125–127] A recent study found that the
performance of the Samsung Gear Sport watch and Oura smart
ring were comparable with that of a medically approved actigra-
phy device in tracking total sleep time, sleep efﬁciency, and wake
after sleep onset.[128] Philips Respironics has also developed a
suite of motion biosensors to track sleep–wake cycles and circa-
dian rhythms using the Philips Health band, ActiWatch
Spectrum Pro, and ActiWatch Spectrum Plus.[129] Its Actiware
software provides a uniﬁed platform for centralized management
of data from multiple actigraphy devices.

5.1. Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders

Musculoskeletal disorders negatively affect the natural body move-
ment and musculoskeletal system (i.e., muscles, ligaments, ten-
dons, nerves, discs, and blood vessels).[130,131] The risk factors
for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) can be ergo-
nomic (i.e., due to manual lifting, forceful exertions, repetitive
tasks, or awkward posture) or individualistic in nature (i.e., poor
habits, lack of rest and recovery, and unhealthy work practices).[132]
Exposure to these risk factors causes fatigue, imbalance, discom-
fort and pain which can worsen to WMSDs and loss of function.
Upper body disorders (including neck and back pain) are common
in ofﬁce jobs where poor sitting postures, a sedentary work style,
low social contact, and high stress are prevalent.[133,134] Lower back
pain is triggered by ergonomic stressors generally encountered by
workers in farming, manufacturing, construction, packaging,
transportation, and service desk jobs.[135–137] Carpal tunnel syn-
drome results from repetitive tasks and speciﬁc wrist positions,
leading to pressure on the wrist’s median nerve and associated
pain, numbness, and weakness in the hand and ﬁngers.

Wearables for WMSDs assess the natural gait, posture, and
physical strength in an objective and nonintrusive manner.
Two examples are as follows: a) The McRoberts DynaPort
MiniMod system consists of the MoveTest and MoveMonitor
for monitoring exercise capacity, physical activity, and gait
parameters.[138] McRoberts products are used with standardized
tests such as the Six Minute Walk Test (i.e., total distance walked
in 6 min, walking speed, and step length and frequency), Sit-to-
Stand Test (i.e., time to rise 5 times from seated position on a
chair), GAIT Test (i.e., gait parameters during a straight trajec-
tory), Sway Test (i.e., displacement in the center of pressure), and
Timed Up and Go Test (i.e., time for sequentially rising from a
chair, gait initiation, walking, and sitting down on the chair).
b) K-invent wearable products are designed to monitor the prog-
ress of rehabilitation interventions to regain or improve the lost
body functions.[139] Examples of K-invent sensors are force plates
that track posture and lower limb strength, grip dynamometer to
measure grip strength, and goniometers that measure the range
of motions by body joints. The companion Kforce app is used to
visualize, customize, and manage the rehabilitation regimen.

Activity trackers (e.g., smartwatches and smart rings) repre-
sent an immensely popular class of consumer wearables that
have overlapping relevance to occupational health and ﬁtness

ucts are sold by Atlas, Casio, Garmin, Push, Wahoo and Whoop.
Typical parameters for comparing smartwatches are price,
weight, size, screen size and resolution, display type, internal

GPS, operating system, waterproof ratting, and in-built sensors
(e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, camera, heart rate sensor, light

sensor, pedometer, barometer, pulse oximeter, speaker, and
microphone). Recent studies have used smartwatches to track
physiological signs (e.g., body temperature, respiration rate,
heart rate, heart rate variability, sleep, step count, etc.) for the
early detection of COVID-19 symptoms and to predict
the
likelihood of infection.[143–146] Amazon has just announced its
foray into health and ﬁtness wearables with the Halo band
for tracking users’ activity levels, sleep, body fat percentage,
and tone of voice.[147] Using body photos and sound bytes
from a microphone, the Halo companion app generates a 3D

Poor motor functions can manifest as hyperkinetic (i.e., exces-
sive, repetitive or involuntary movement) or hypokinetic move-
ment disorders (i.e., reduced or lack of movement).[151] They are
mostly caused by neurologic conditions (i.e., degeneration of the
brain, brain stem, spinal cord or nervous system).[152] Examples
of functional movement disorders include ataxia (i.e., loss of
muscle coordination), dystonia (i.e., involuntary muscle contrac-
tions), spasticity, tremors and essential tremor, restless legs syn-
drome, multiple
syndrome,
Huntington disease, and Parkinson’s disease.[153] The risk fac-
tors for functional movement disorders include aging, infection,
drug reactions, toxins, previous surgery, stressful events, second-
hand tobacco smoke, solvents, metals, and pesticides.

system atrophy,

Tourette

In the workplace, the early signs and symptoms of movement
disorders are difﬁcult to discern as the underlying conditions
evolve and generally worsen over time.[154,155] The affected
person may suffer from postural imbalance, lack of coordination,
an unsteady gait, twitching, muscle spasms, and tremors.[156]
There may be negative impacts on speech, vision, writing, and
eye movement.[157] The signs and symptoms of movement
disorders tend to dampen the alertness, energy level, productiv-
ity, and social morale of the affected worker.[158] The following
are examples of wearables for assessing movement disorders.

Electronic walkways from GAITRite measure the spatiotempo-
ral parameters of gait, compare gait imbalances, document slips
and falls, and evaluate the effectiveness of different interven-
tions.[159] As the patient ambulates over the GAITRite walkway,
the software captures the relative nature of every footfall. The
recorded data are used to establish the baseline functions and
to compare with subjective ﬁndings for appropriate decisions.

Great Lakes NeuroTechnologies has a range of products for
objectively measuring movement disorders, particularly those
related to Parkinson’s disease.[160] Its products (i.e., KinesiaU
and Kinesia 360(cid:3)) utilize a Kinesia sensor worn on the ﬁnger,
the Kinesia One App loaded on a smartwatch or iPad, and the
Kinesia ProView data visualization toolkit for task-based or

continuous motor assessment. The Kinesia sensor consists of
a triaxial accelerometer,
triaxial gyroscope, Bluetooth radio,
and wireless recharging unit. The Kinesia One App is used to
report the motor scores for multiple tasks/parameters such as
arms resting, arms extended, ﬁnger-to-nose, ﬁnger tapping,
toe tapping, leg lifts, walking and turning, hand grasping, etc.
The measured outcomes are resting tremor, postural tremor,
kinetic tremor, bradykinesia (speed, amplitude, and rhythm),
leg agility, gait, freezing of gait, and/or dyskinesia.

The Personal KinetiGraph (PKG) System by Global Kinetics
assess the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (e.g., bradykinesia,
dyskinesia, and tremor compared with controls) in a continuous,
objective, and ambulatory manner.[161] In addition, the PKG system
provides an assessment of daytime somnolence, immobility, and
propensity of impulsive behavior. The PKG system consists of a
wrist-worn PKG Watch that records movement and proprietary
data-driven algorithms that report the ﬁndings based on routine
daily activities. The PKG Watch is intended to be worn for a
7-day period, after which the processed data (such as scores repre-
sentative of symptoms, motor ﬂuctuations, sustained immobility,
daytime sleep, somnolence, and tremor) are reported to the wearer.
With changing work styles, wearables for posture awareness
and real-time feedback to correct slouching or slumping have
gained considerable attention. Upright posture helps the oxygen
intake of lungs, reduces stress, and boosts the overall body
appearance, conﬁdence, strength, vitality, and work productiv-
ity.[158] On the contrary, poor posture can lead to physical fatigue,
trips and falls, varicose veins, cardiovascular disease, and diges-
tive issues.[162] Posture correctors in the form of upper body
braces and straps are available from companies such as
BraceAbility, Gearari, Marakym, Truweo, Vokka, and Xnature.
Strapless posture correctors from Upright Posture Trainer are
designed as patches embedded with multiple sensors to naturally
help achieve good posture habits.[163] Its Upright Go 2 device is
placed on the back using a hypoallergenic adhesive to track the
body posture throughout the day and train the user to correct
slouching through gentle vibrations.

5.3. Occupational Lung Diseases and Continuous Respiratory
Monitoring

The risk factors for occupational lung disease are work-related
exposure to gases, dust, fumes, chemicals, sudden temperature
changes, and psychosocial stress.[164] Healthcare workers have
increased risks of exposure to respiratory pathogens and infec-
tious agents. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
results from the inhalation of smoke and airborne particles com-
monly found in coal mining, metal smelting, construction, trans-
portation, farming and the manufacturing of chemicals, rubber,
leather, plastics, textiles, and food products.[165–172]

Pulmonary function tests are commonly used to assess lung
functioning by measuring parameters such as tidal capacity, tidal
volume, residual volume, total lung capacity, expiratory forced vital
capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1),
and forced expiratory ﬂow.[173] A spirometry test measures the air-
ﬂow breathed in and out into a mouthpiece using the FVC and
FEV1. A lower FEV1, FVC, or FEV1/FVC ratio may suggest
restrictive or obstructive airways.[174] A plethysmography test

measures lung volume by estimating changes in pressure while
sitting inside a clear, airtight chamber. Wearable inductive belts,
strain sensors, and optoelectronic devices measure changes in the
circumference of the ribcage and torso during respiration to esti-
mate the respiration rate and volume.[175,176] The following are
examples of wearables for continuous respiratory monitoring.

Spire Health has developed a wearable breathing tracker for
chronic respiratory diseases.[177] The Spire Health Tag is used
to monitor the breathing patterns, sleep patterns and stress lev-
els, and subsequently provides real-time advice on stress reactiv-
ity (e.g., being calm and deep breathing). Its respiratory sensor
measures the expansion and contraction of the thoracic cavity,
while its photoplethysmography (PPG) pulse rate sensor meas-
ures the resting heart rate and calories burned. The Spire Health
Tags last for up to 12 months and are designed to be washed and
dried. A companion Spire Health app displays the long-term res-
piration proﬁle (e.g., respiration rate, time for inhalation/exhala-
tion, variability, and full waveform), pulse rate, and activity
signature of the wearer. Any deviations from the clinical baseline
are automatically detected and shared with the care team many
days before symptoms are reported by the patient.

IMEC has developed a wearable patch for continuous respira-
tory monitoring, even during sleep or ambulatory movement.[117]
The patch incorporates its system-on-chip (SoC) readout circuits
to record sensor/signal level multimodal signals relevant to respi-
ratory health, such as electromyograms, mechanomyograms,
electrocardiograms, bioimpedances, and sound. Using AI algo-
rithms, the inferred noninvasive digital biomarkers are respira-
tory rate, relative volume, breathing efﬁciency, oxygen saturation,
and respiratory sounds. IMEC has also developed medical algo-
rithms to handle noisy data and provide actionable insights.

In addition, portable, ﬁngertip pulse oximeters are available to
measure the blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2 as a percentage)
and pulse rate (PR in bpm) for anyone on the move, such as ﬁeld
workers and sports enthusiasts. These devices can rapidly detect
how efﬁciently oxygen is carried from the heart to the body
extremities. Normal readings of the SpO2 are between 95 to
100%, whereas a reading below 90% may indicate hypoxemia,
mild respiratory diseases, and the need for supplemental oxygen.
Most oximeters determine the pulse rate and SpO2 within
8(cid:6)10 s, display the SpO2 for up to 100%, and can last up to
30 h on two AAA batteries. The results are displayed on a large
digital display (organic light-emitting diode (OLED), liquid crys-
tal display (LCD), or LED). Most of these pulse oximeters can be
used both as a pediatric pulse oximeter for kids and a blood oxy-
gen monitor for adults. Some manufacturers of these oximeters
are AccuMed, BPL Medical Technologies, CVS Health, Hesley,
HealthSense,
iProven, mibest, NuvoMed, Roscoe Medical,
TrackAid, Tomorotec, Wellue, and Zacurate.

5.4. Occupational Cardiovascular Diseases

The work-related risk factors for occupational cardiovascular dis-
ease are sedentary behavior, an unhealthy diet, tobacco smoke,
poor air quality, lead exposure, and stress-contributing factors
such as job strain and insecurity, low social contact, and a lack
of decision latitude.[178,179] Symptoms of cardiovascular disease
include shortness of breath, pain or discomfort in the chest or

limbs, rapid or irregular heartbeat, a lack of balance or coordina-
tion, fatigue, confusion, numbness, and fainting.[180] In addition
to blood tests and chest X-rays, heart health is measured by blood
pressure monitoring, electrocardiography (ECG or EKG), echo-
cardiography, the exercise stress test, and cardiac magnetic res-
onance imaging.[181,182]

Continuous EKG recordings for detecting an irregular heart
rate or rhythm over long time periods (i.e., from 24 to 72 h) is
provided by the classic Holter monitor.[183–185] The following
are examples of wearables for assessing cardiovascular health.
The KardiaMobile EKG monitor by Omron is used to record
medical-grade EKG data by placing ﬁngers on a sensor pad and
connecting to the Omron App.[186] There are no wires, cables or
gels needed to record the electrical signals, and the monitor pro-
vides a clear view of the P, QRS, and T waves of the EKG wave-
forms. The Omron EKG device is cleared by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to detect normal heart rhythm, atrial ﬁbril-
lation, bradycardia, and tachycardia in 30 s. The device can also
detect normal sinus rhythm, sinus rhythm with premature ven-
tricular contractions (PVCs), sinus rhythm with supraventricular
ectopy (SVE), and sinus rhythm with Wide QRS.

iBeat has developed a smartwatch (iBeat Heart Watch) to con-
tinuously monitor the heart, blood ﬂow, oxygen levels, and other
biometrics, and notiﬁes the wearer if an unusual event
is
detected using proprietary AI algorithms.[187] The iBeat Heart
Watch screen is a 1.39 in. AMOLED panel with 400 (cid:5) 400 reso-
lution and has a 350 mAh battery. In situations where the wearer
is unresponsive to the notiﬁcations, the iBeat 24 h dispatch team
is contacted to send medical help through its comprehensive
Heart Hero Network. An emergency button is available to contact
emergency medical teams, police, ﬁreﬁghters, family, or friends.
The Zio system by iRhythm Technology is used to detect and
diagnose irregular heart rhythms for up to 14 days.[188] The Zio
Monitor is worn on the chest after prescription by a healthcare
provider. The Zio Patch is a small, unobtrusive adhesive patch
attached to the skin that essentially functions as an ambulatory
cardiac monitor. Upon having unusual heart symptoms, the top
of the Zio Patch is manually tapped. The heart symptoms are
logged into a symptoms booklet or into the MyZio Symptom
Tracking app. Some parameters detected by the Zio XT device
are the heart rate, sinus rhythm, ventricular tachycardia, atrial
ﬁbrillation and pause, and sinus rhythm with supraventricular
ectopy (SVE). After the end of the recording period, the monitor
and symptoms booklet are mailed to iRhythm, which analyzes
the heart data to categorize the type of arrhythmia and sends
the report to the wearer’s physician.[189]

A disposable health patch by IMEC is used to measure vital
health signs simultaneously using its proprietary MUSEIC v3
SoC solution.[117] The IMEC chip, powered by an ARM Cortex
M4 processor, has biomedical sensor readouts for measuring
the heart rate using ECG, breathing rate using bioimpedance,
and blood oxygen saturation through by photoplethysmography.
The data preprocessing is conducted on-chip to reduce the
latency and bandwidth typically associated with data transmis-
sion to the cloud or other devices. The data transfer is 100%
secure because of its on-chip dedicated hardware for encryption
and authentication. The IMEC health patch is suitable for
ambulatory long-term monitoring of patients located at home
(e.g., chronic patients or patients recovering from surgery).

5.5. Occupational Sun Exposure and Continuous Glucose
Monitoring

Skin cancers can result from outdoor UV exposure and occupa-
tional exposure to arsenic, soot, and ionizing radiation.[190–193]
The market trend indicates that skin-aware wearables and com-
panion apps are becoming an integral part of the personalized
skin care and cosmetics industry.[194] The following are examples
of wearables for tracking outdoor UV exposure and managing
thermal comfort.

L’Oréal has launched the My Skin Track UV device to measure
the amount of UV exposure and educating the public about sun
protection.[195] The device also measures the levels of other envi-
ronmental aggressors such as heat, humidity, pollen, and pollu-
tion. Its battery-free wearable sensor is worn on the thumbnail,
measures the UVA and UVB rays’ exposure during the course of
the day, and connects to its mobile app via NFC to transfer data to
the user’s smartphone. The wearable sensor is activated by sun-
light, and hence it can last for several years. Data can be stored up
to 3 months and the app shows the exposure trends over time.
QSun has built the QSun Wearable device to track the daily
sunlight exposure and vitamin D production with Bluetooth
low energy (BLE) communication to smartphones.[196] The
QSun App provides information on UV exposure history, the
daily UV index forecast,
the UV index map, sunscreen
reminders, and Vitamin D intake, along with options to review
the progress and get personalized recommendations on sun
safety based on skin type.

Embr Labs has designed the Wave bracelet as a personal ther-
mostat for the wearer.[197] During thermal discomfort, the user
activates the Wave bracelet to generate thermal or cooling wave-
forms through its thermoelectric heat pump targeting the ther-
moreceptors located in the inner region of the wrist. The local
warming or cooling sensation through the device sends favorable
signals to the brain to improve the overall perception of thermal
discomfort.

Within the realm of wearables for the diagnosis of blood con-
ditions, one notable example is the Dexcom technology solution
for the continuous management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.[198]
The Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system
uses a slim sensor inserted beneath the skin to detect blood glu-
cose levels every 5 min. There are no ﬁnger pricks or device cal-
ibrations needed with the Dexcom G6 CGM system. A single
Dexcom G6 sensor can be worn for up to 10 days. A companion
app displays the data with customizable alerts about high or low
blood glucose levels. Wearables in the near future will be able to
relate emotions and states of mind with relevant biomarkers,
muscle activity, and brain waves for informed decisions on one’s
current health status.[199–202]

6. Connected Worker Solutions for Data
Management and Advanced Analytics

Workplace wearables serve as data collection devices within a
central hub (i.e., connected worker solution)
that monitors
and manages organizational assets with minimal human inter-
vention. Here, organizational assets refer to machinery, equip-
and even workers ﬁtted with
ment,

cameras,

sensors,

wearable devices that capture relevant biometrics and environ-
mental data. Figure 6 shows a typical architecture of a connected
worker solution. Wearables and other mobile devices use appro-
priate device services to communicate with the edge gateway.[203]
MQTT is a popular messaging protocol that uses a connect-
publish-subscribe-disconnect model
to transmit messages
between clients and devices. MQTT is considered to be extremely
lightweight because it requires a small code footprint and small
network bandwidth. Other device services and networking pro-
tocols for managing and monitoring network-connected devices
(REST), OPC Uniﬁed
are Representational State Transfer
Architecture (OPC-UA), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee,
and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). To provide
real-time insights, edge computing is the preferred choice where
the data processing and decision-making nodes are closer to the
data collection devices. The edge gateway is responsible for data
pre-processing, data caching, edge computing, and edge analyt-
ics. The cloud hub is used for data management and storage,
stream analytics, decision making, rules engine, and security
and privacy.[204]

Advanced analytics with AI and ML is applied to the cloud data
in the cloud hub to extract intelligent information and make pre-
dictions about asset allocations, operations, and supply chain
logistics.[205] As an alternative, stream analytics can be carried
out on real-time streaming data to score incoming events and
provide actionable insights for future decisions.[206] Advanced
AI/ML tools analyze the data from disparate sources, identify
key relationships between safety events, and unravel the causal
factors indicative of high-risk incidents.[207] A central dashboard
or visualization studio is maintained where all the raw data,
information, inferences, and insights are accessible in a compre-
hensible format
to operators, workers, supervisors, and/or
Environment, health, and safety (EH&S) personnel. The central
dashboard provides real-time monitoring and management of
assets, devices, ﬁeld services, and event streams to the supervi-
sor, along with bidirectional communication with the onsite
operators and workers. The command station can notify remotely
located supervisors about speciﬁc workers exposed to harsh
chemicals, fatigue, exhaustion, and dehydration. By tracking dan-
gerous work conditions, appropriate and timely notiﬁcations can
be sent to lone workers to take recovery breaks. The central dash-
board automates the tasks of scheduling (of jobs, tools, and
equipment), registration and logging of operational assets, and
certiﬁcation and compliance checks. In addition, predictive ana-
lytics is employed to foresee equipment
failure, optimize
resource allocation, manage productivity trends, and identify
risk-prone situations.[208] Depending on the action items, the
desired outcomes of connected worker solutions are continuous
monitoring, connected logistics, business process optimization,
risk and cost reduction, predictive maintenance, and real-time
insights about assets.

There are different options for connected worker solutions,
and it is often difﬁcult to judge the value and suitability of a con-
nected worker solution for a given workplace. The choice of an
appropriate connected worker solution depends on the proper
assessment of several competing factors at the workplace, such
as the desired business insights, the nature of the work environ-
ment, safety risks and hazards, platform scalability, characteris-
tics of assets and legacy equipment, needs for predictive

Figure 6. Architecture of a connected worker solution. The data collection devices use different device services to connect to the edge gateway for data
preprocessing, caching, edge computing, and edge analytics. The cloud hub is responsible for data management, storage, security, and privacy. There are
capabilities for streaming analytics with rule engines and AI/ML algorithms. The visualization studio displays the analyzed results on the dashboard and
sends notiﬁcations to operators, supervisors, safety personnel, and workers. The strategies to control assets, devices, ﬁeld services, and event streams are
suggested by predictive algorithms. Finally, action items are executed to achieve the desired outcomes.

described below (Table 6).

Amazon has developed the Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Internet of Things (IoT) Core platform to connect and manage
a large number of devices.[209] Data management and analytics
are provided by AWS cloud computing. The AWS Greengrass
allows users to run AWS on edge devices using AWS Lambda
functions or Docker containers for local computation and near
real-time analytics. AWS IoT Device Management helps to reg-
ister, regulate, and monitor IoT devices while the AWS IoT
Device Defender ensures that network conﬁgurations follow
the best security practices. There are services for running
advanced analytics on the collected data to detect and respond
to target events. The AWS IoT Things Graph generates custom-
izable IoT conﬁgurations and sophisticated workﬂows based on
prebuilt models of popular devices (e.g., cameras, mobile

sensors) available through Amazon Simple Storage Service
(S3) and Amazon Recognition.

The Cisco Kinetic platform protects clients from security risks
while helping to deploy and manage operations at different
scales.[210] Their four broad areas of focus are network connec-
tivity, connectivity management, edge computing, and data con-
trol and exchange. The Cisco Kinetic platform consists of the
Edge and Fog Processing Module that computes data at distrib-
uted nodes and the Data Control Module that moves the com-
puted data to the appropriate cloud application.

Enterprise Health has created enterprise solutions with on-site
clinics to integrate occupational health and safety with clinical
care.[211] Enterprise Health software aggregates all workers’
health information, including their immunization records, com-
pliance, risk factors, and medical history. Its platform provides
clients with a single place to document, manage, and report
on occupational injury and illness. Employees have electronic
access to their health records with tracking of required surveil-
lance
to maintain work
exams,
certiﬁcations.

devices.[212] Hitachi works with customers to analyze issues, con-
struct hypotheses, build prototypes of possible solutions, and exe-
cute delivery and implementation. As an example of
the
platform’s applicability in the workplace, Hitachi’s technology
solutions have been used for smart manufacturing and to create
next-generation factories that can handle mass customization of
machine tools. This feat was accomplished by installing auto-
mated and unmanned systems and setting up IoT environments
with RFID tags. The beneﬁts were accelerated factory control
cycles, better production visualization, operational efﬁciency,
and reduced manufacturing lead times. Recently Hitachi and
Microsoft formed a strategic alliance to provide next-generation
digital solutions for the manufacturing and logistics sectors of
Japan, North America, and Southeast Asia. This collaboration
will leverage the Hitachi Digital Supply Chain, Hitachi Digital
Solution for Logistics/Delivery Optimization Service, Azure
IoT, HoloLens 2, and Dynamic 365 Remote Assist for huMan,
Machine, Material, Method (4M) data collection, predictive main-
tenance, and remote assistance to workers.

The Honeywell Experion Process Knowledge System (PKS) is
automating process
a distributed control platform for
manufacturing and managing assets or processes.[213] This sys-
tem can monitor employees’ fatigue levels, reduce their process
trips and incidents, and help boost their productivity. Routine
its
and abnormal work situations

can be detected by

Collaborative Station and Application Control Environment,
along with supervisory control solutions across multiple sites
within the enterprise. Big data analytics also enables early event
detection.

The IBM Maximo Asset Performance Management (APM)
suite helps organizations manage their assets, extend asset life-
cyles, and improve operations.[214] The dashboard aggregates
data from multiple sources (such as daily work/inventory
requirements, plans for scheduled work, and the progress of
projects, programs and work efforts) and visualizes them in a
single place. IBM’s Maximo Worker Insights provides real-time
insights for inventory, managing occupancy and no-go zones,
tracing work orders and entry/exit times, checking adherence
to privacy policies, and even monitoring employees’ body tem-

Insights predicts the likelihood of future asset failures and their
impact. IBM’s Watson Works performs data computation and
decision-making using its Watson AI models and applications.
The Intelex Environmental Health, Safety and Quality
Management (EHSQ) platform has web and mobile applications
to reduce risks, ensure compliance, and improve productiv-
ity.[215] Some applications integrated into this platform relate
to the management of chemicals, risks, hazards, audits, inspec-
tions, employee training, and certiﬁcations. Intelex also provides
the Occupational Injury and Illness software to generate reports

on job-related incidents and illnesses in compliance with regu-
latory agencies. This enables faster and streamlined tracking and
reporting of incidents with greater transparency between work-
ers and safety managers.

IoTConnect has multiple platforms for the smart monitoring
of factories, ofﬁces, assets, energy, ﬂeets, food, air quality, and
warehouses.[216] The IoTConnect Smart Connected Worker solu-
tion allows employers to remotely track their ﬁeld workers to
ensure a safe work environment with better regulatory compli-
ance. It further aims to reduce unexpected accidents and the risk
of errors through greater visibility of worker activities and
adherence to safety procedures/policies. For example, geofen-
ces can be created to remotely track the location of workers
in hazardous worksites and to send them real-time triggers
when they cross a geofence. The IoTConnect platform can mon-
itor and analyze workers’ vital signs and environmental factors
(i.e., noise levels, toxic gas levels, and surrounding tempera-
ture) in real time.

The Microsoft Azure IoT cloud services platform is built to
connect, monitor, and manage a large number of assets.[217]
The Azure IoT Hub enables device-to-cloud (and vice versa) com-
munication and back-end services on the cloud. Microsoft’s
Dynamic 365 Remote Assist empowers technicians to collaborate
and work efﬁciently across different
locations using the
HoloLens 2 and an Android or iOS device. This promotes virtual
site inspection, workﬂow visualization, real-time problem solv-
ing, remote training/education, and associated cost savings.
These Microsoft solutions for the workplace are gaining signiﬁ-
cant traction with clients in diverse industry sectors such as

The Oracle Connected Worker Cloud platform provides real-
time visibility of the worksite and workers.[218] Using GPS tech-
nology, this platform can track the physical location of workers in
hazardous environments, monitor and alert them to possible
safety violations, and analyze Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) for projects and employees. Its diagnostics analytics is
used to relate worksite incidents to data from personnel, equip-
ment, and the environment.

The Siemens MindSphere cloud operating system connects
different machines, products, plants, and systems for data col-
lection and advanced analytics.[219] The operating system is
based on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) architecture where
users connect to the cloud to analyze their data in real-time.

7. Current Challenges and the Path Forward

There are some caveats in using commercial workplace wear-
ables and connected worker solutions for the safety health,
and productivity of workers.[2,4] a) Only a few workplace technol-
ogies have gone through rigorous ﬁeld studies, extensive valida-
tion against standards, and approval processes by related

heterogeneous

require multiple

agencies. With a lack of sufﬁcient peer-reviewed data, it is difﬁ-
cult to assess the safety and efﬁcacy of most workplace technolo-
gies in the market. b) There are heterogeneity and compatibility
issues among the available workplace technologies as developers
are reluctant to adhere to common evaluation practices. For
example, certain wearable devices may only be compatible with
selected operation systems (e.g., Google’s Wear OS, Apple’s
Samsung’s Tizen,
Watch OS, Garmin OS, WebOS,
MediaTek’s LinkIt, Linux-derivative etc.), which may be a barrier
for communicating with other existing devices running on alter-
nate operating systems. Similarly, remote worker health moni-
toring may
sensors
(e.g., motion sensor, electrocardiogram, heart rate monitor,
blood oxygen monitor, etc.) to get an overall understanding of
health status, but these heterogeneous sensors may not be
supported by the same operating system, SDK, or data transfer
protocols. Moreover, different providers may terminate or relin-
quish the support of their existing wearables, apps, and services
in this rapidly evolving and competitive marketplace. This creates
a challenge for actual users on how to choose and invest in cross-
technology platforms that can seamlessly communicate across
multiple products. c) There is a general lack of consensus on
how to integrate raw data from multiple sources (in situ and
in real time) at the level of the individual while performing dif-
ferent operational tasks. Inculcating a proper data-driven culture
and analytical acumen within the IT staff takes time and effort.
As such, most employers run the risk of ceaselessly collecting
data across disparate sources and making investments in data
warehousing and business intelligence tools. d) The extensive
use of workplace technologies may lead to device fatigue,
over-dependency on such technology, and helplessness in the
event of technology outages. An excessive monitoring of workers
in the workplace may result in the Hawthorne effect where a
user’s behavior can be altered due to the awareness of being
observed. Workers equipped with wearables may lose opportuni-
ties to interact with colleagues and their autonomy in performing
tasks. e) As wearables have the potential to collect private infor-
mation (e.g., work hours, breaks clocked, sleep hours, interests,
habits, social circles, and even health records), there is little clar-
ity on who actually owns the user data or how they intend to use
the data.[32] The collected information could facilitate bias, prej-
udice and discriminatory behavior in the workplace. Wearables
and mobile computing devices are also prone to security lapses
and data breaches.[203] f ) The general acceptability of data analy-
sis tools is a realistic challenge for the workforce.[32] It is difﬁcult
to trust the judgments and scoring systems of AI/ML algorithms,
particularly in matters concerning people’s health and safety.
One survey indicated that company executives have made major
decisions based on their “own intuition or experience” or the
“advice and experience of others internally” rather than “data
and analysis.”[220] Another survey of 480 organizations found that
merely 4% of them were using predictive analytics to forecast
outcomes, 86% of
them focused primarily on operational
reporting and only 10% of these organizations used some sort
of statistical model and root-cause analysis.[221]

The outlook of commercial workplace wearables and con-
nected worker solutions is very promising, considering the
power of these technologies to aggregate data from heteroge-
neous sensors in a continuous manner and apply predictive

analytics to identify organizational risks and workﬂow bottle-
necks for a myriad of industrial applications. To thrive in this
competitive and rapidly evolving market, device manufacturers
often need to prioritize their efforts towards a growing customer
base with recurring revenues and proﬁts. Toward this goal, there
are several directions to build a successful business model—
from understanding the technology adoption paradigms to
large-scale
proposed methods.
a) Conceptual models (e.g., Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA),
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Uniﬁed Theory of
Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)) can help identify
the inﬂuencing factors for technology adoption, such as behav-
ioral intention, trust, risks, ethics, perceived privacy risk, per-
perceived
ceived
vulnerability, social inﬂuence, and demographics. b) Large-scale
studies conducted by independent third parties and end-user
companies can help to develop validation and reliability models,
which in turn could attract future clients and investments.
Several companies in this domain have active collaborations with
end-user companies to generate large data at the worksite, vali-
date their AI/ML models, and identify new applications.
c) Financial incentives, academic grants, and crowdsourcing
research can bring in researchers, scholars, and students from
universities to validate and improve their end-to-end data pipe-
line and generate a body of scientiﬁc publications, white papers,
and case studies. This approach is being pursued by leading
cloud service providers,
including IBM, Microsoft, Google,
Apple, Amazon, Oracle, Cisco, Siemens, and Honeywell.
Creating open-source hardware and software platforms with
seamless process integration can be a successful route to spur
community science, and has been proven by companies such
as Arduino, Adafruit Industries, Raspberry Pi, MakerBot, and
Sparkfun. d) Obtaining regulatory clearance (e.g., FDA 510(k)
clearance) and safety compliance certiﬁcations can boost con-
sumer conﬁdence, open up new markets, connect with reseller
networks, and expand the customer base.

As a path forward to invest in and explore the beneﬁts of work-
place technologies, there are some points to consider, particularly
for the corporate leadership, safety managers, and supervisors.
a) A cost-beneﬁt analysis needs to be carried out to understand
the value proposition of introducing new technologies with
respect to existing manpower, skillsets and legacy assets.[222]
The beneﬁts could be in terms of continuous and unobtrusive
monitoring, connected logistics, process optimization, predictive
maintenance, real-time insights about assets, cost reduction,
increased revenue, and higher productivity.[9,206] b) Worker edu-
cation is necessary to explain the rights of workers, address their
apprehensions, and gain their acceptance.[32] Appropriate depart-
ments need to regulate data collection, analytics, control compli-
ance, and security. In an unprecedented move to promote data
transparency and privacy, Apple has recently started to disclose to
its customers the types of personal data collected by the apps
installed in its iOS devices. Apple will also release an antitracking
feature where apps will have to ask for permission prior to track-
ing the user’s activities.[223] c) It is advisable to generate baseline
curves for individual workers in realistic workplaces having lim-
ited power budgets and cloud connectivity.[27] It is critical to
recruit committed users who can provide real-time feedback
and revalidation with regard to their mental and corporeal status,

behavioral preferences, technology adherence, and overall bene-
ﬁts.[224] Doing so will ensure that ground truth data are accurate,
credible, scalable, and of high quality and granularity.[203]
d) Finally, only the right conclusions should be drawn from data
analytics and model tools.[225,226] It is important to tell the story
behind the data to all stakeholders in simple language, while
acknowledging the fact that even the most advanced algorithms
cannot capture all possible real-world scenarios indicative of
occupational risks and hazards.[9–12,227,228]

8. Conclusion

Protecting and improving the safety, health, and productivity of
workers is paramount for companies as they face post-pandemic
challenges of acute shortage of skilled labor, strains on supply
chain management, global inﬂation, and rising medical costs.
In this regard, intelligent systems (deployable sensors and ana-
lytics) play a critical role to facilitate TWH through continuous
monitoring, management, and prediction of workplace risks
and organizational assets. In this work, we reviewed the recent
trends in commercial wearable technologies and connected
worker solutions being applied to different work settings to pro-
mote ergonomics, situational awareness, injury risk manage-
ment, efﬁcient workﬂow, and healthy behavioral and cognitive
habits. While a majority of devices monitor human performance
(e.g., biomechanical functions, physical activity, and/or physio-
logical signals), new intelligent systems are being introduced
to actively monitor and manage mental health (e.g., stress, emo-
tions, states of mind) using brain wave sensing, biofeedback and
human-in-the-loop models. There is ample scope for device man-
ufacturers to expand their customer base, considering the predic-
tive power of these intelligent systems to identify a variety of
occupational risk scenarios for timely intervention. To enable
large-scale technology adoption at the workplace, it is important
for device manufacturers to validate the reliability their products
by independent third-party testing. At the same time, technology
consumers need to identify the true value proposition of these
technologies with respect to legacy assets. Toward this end,
our work attempts to bridge the knowledge gap between device
manufacturers and technology consumers by providing a com-
prehensive review of recent workplace technologies.
