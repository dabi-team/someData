Spatial  clustering  detection  methods  are  widely  used  in  many  fields  including  epidemiology, 

ecology, biology, physics, and sociology. In these fields, areal data is often of interest; such data 

may result from spatial aggregation (e.g. the number disease cases in a county) or may be inherent 

attributes of the areal unit as a whole (e.g. the habitat suitability of conserved land parcel). This 

study aims to assess the performance of two spatial clustering detection methods on areal data: 

the average nearest neighbor (ANN) ratio and Ripley’s K function. These methods are designed 

for point process data, but their ease of implementation in GIS software (e.g., in ESRI ArcGIS) 

and the lack of analogous methods for areal data have  contributed to their use for areal data.  

Despite the popularity of applying these methods to areal data, little research has explored their 

properties in the areal data context.  In this paper we conduct a simulation study to evaluate the 

performance of each method for areal data under  various areal structures and types of spatial 

dependence. These studies find that traditional approach to hypothesis testing using the ANN ratio 

or Ripley’s K function results in inflated empirical type I rates when applied to areal data.  We 

demonstrate that this issue can be remedied for both approaches by using Monte Carlo methods 

which acknowledge the areal nature of the data to estimate the distribution of the test statistic 

under the null hypothesis.  While such an approach is not currently implemented in ArcGIS, it can 

be easily done in R using code provided by the authors. 

1 Introduction

Researchers have been using spatial clustering analysis for many years to analyze data for spatial 

patterns. One of the earliest examples of spatial clustering analysis in public health occurred when 

John Snow mapped the location of cholera cases to identify the source of an outbreak in London 

in 1894 (Moore & Carpenter, 1999). Over the past few decades, the popularization of geographical 

information systems (GIS) software has led to the development of many new methods for spatial 

analysis. A Google Scholar search for ‘spatial clustering’ returns 15,600 results published from 

2001 to 2010, with an increase to 28,000 results published from 2011 to 2020.   Both point process 

(latitude-longitude) and areal data can exhibit spatial patterns, and a variety of methods have been 

developed to analyze spatial patterns in both types of data.   

One of the oldest techniques for detecting spatial clustering is the average nearest neighbor (ANN) 

ratio (Clark & Evans, 1954).  Given a set of ‘observation locations’ (e.g. coordinate locations of a 

specific  plant  species,  street  addresses  of  violent  crimes,  etc.),  the  ANN  method  computes  the 

distance between each observation location and its nearest neighbor and uses the average ‘nearest 

neighbor  distance’  to  compute  a  test  statistic.  The  ANN  ratio  has  been  widely  used  to  detect 

clustering  in  various  types  of  point  process  data,  including  disease  cases  (Aziz  et  al.,  2012; 

Khademi  et  al.,  2016;  Melyantono,  Susetya,  Widayani,  Tenaya,  &  Hartawan,  2021),  crime 

hotspots (Brookman-Amissah, Wemegah, & Okyere, 2014; Wing & Tynon, 2006; Z. Zhang et al., 

2020) and archeological artifacts (Kıroğlu, 2003; Whallon, 1974).  The ANN ratio has also been 

used to detect clustering in areal data (after mapping to centroids) in disease case data (Mollalo, 

Alimohammadi, Shirzadi, & Malek, 2015) aggregated to the municipality level. 

Ripley’s K function was first developed in 1976 and can simultaneously describe spatial patterns 

at  different  scales.  For a given distance  𝑡, Ripley’s K function returns the  expected number of 

observation  locations  within  a  distance  of  𝑡  from  a  randomly  selected  observation  location.  

2 

 
Ripley’s  K  function  can  be  used  to  determine  if  data  are  clustered  (or  dispersed)  at  a  specific 

geographic scale determined by 𝑡.  Ripley’s K function has been used to assess point process data 

for clustering in a variety of fields including epidemiology (Hohl, Delmelle, Tang, & Casas, 2016; 

Lentz, Blackburn, & Curtis, 2011; Ramis et al., 2015), ecology  (Haase, 1995; Moeur, 1993; Wolf, 

2005), and sociology (Lu & Chen, 2007; Vadlamani & Hashemi, 2020).  It has also been applied 

to areal data (after mapping the areal units to their centroids) in a variety of applications including 

disease case data aggregated at the municipality level (Karunaweera et al., 2020; Mollalo et al., 

2015; Skog, Linde, Palmgren, Hauska, & Elgh, 2014), locations of conserved land (Zipp, Lewis, 

&  Provencher,  2017),  locations  of  land  parcels  in  industrial  use  (Qiao,  Huang,  &  Tian,  2019), 

human-wildlife  interactions  (Kretser,  Sullivan,  &  Knuth,  2008),  and  rockfall  events  (Tonini  & 

Abellan, 2014). 

The  ANN  ratio  and  Ripley’s  K  function  were  developed  for  point  process  data.  However, 

Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) ArcGIS software allows the user to implement 

both these methods on areal data using their Average Nearest Neighbors Tool (ANN ratio) and the 

Multidistance Spatial Cluster Analysis Tool (Ripley’s K function); both tools are in the Spatial 

Statistics  Toolbox.  When  the  user  applies  either  method  to  areal  data  (i.e.  polygon  features), 

ArcGIS  automatically maps each polygon  feature to  its centroid and applies the method to  the 

resulting set of points (Esri, 2021a; Esri, 2021b). To our knowledge, the performance of the ANN 

ratio  and  Ripley’s  K  function  under  these  conditions  has  never  been  evaluated.  Both  methods 

assume that under the null hypothesis, the observation locations arise from a homogenous Poisson 

process. However, for areal data the centroids of smaller units tend to be closer to the centroids of 

their  neighbors  when  compared  to  the  centroids  of  larger  units,  making  it  improbable  that  the 

locations of the centroids will follow a homogeneous Poisson process even in the absence of spatial 

3 

 
clustering. As the homogeneous Poisson process assumption is likely violated for most areal data 

structures, it is advisable to assess the performance (i.e. empirical type I error rate and empirical 

power) of the ANN ratio and Ripley’s K function when applied to areal data.   

In  this  paper,  we  conduct  a  simulation  study  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  each  method  as 

implemented  in  ArcGIS  for  areal  data  under  different  types  of  spatial  dependence  and  areal 

structures.    We  compare  the  performance  of  each  method  under  the  standard  ArcGIS 

implementation with an alternate implementation in which the null distribution of each test statistic 

is estimated using Monte Carlo methods that acknowledge the underlying areal structure of the 

data. Section 2 presents a detailed description of the two spatial clustering methods.  Section 3 

describes the simulation study and Section 4 describes its results. Section 5 contains discussion 

and concluding remarks. 

2 Methods 

The ANN ratio and Ripley’s K function can be used to perform a hypothesis test for the presence 

of spatial clustering or dispersion.  Traditionally, the null hypothesis for each of these tests is that 

the  observed  locations  exhibit  complete  spatial  randomness  (CSR),  that  is,  the  observation 

locations  arise  from  a  two-dimensional  homogeneous  Poisson  process.  Formally,  a  stochastic 

process is said to be a homogeneous Poisson process with rate 𝜆 if the number of events in any 

bounded  region  𝐴,  denoted  𝑁(𝐴),  is  Poisson  distributed  with  mean  intensity  𝜆|𝐴|,  that  is, 

Pr(𝑁(𝐴) = 𝑛) = 𝑒−𝜆|𝐴|(𝜆|𝐴|)𝑛/𝑛!, where |𝐴| denotes the area of 𝐴. Given that there are 𝑛 events 

in 𝐴, those events form an independent random sample from a uniform distribution on 𝐴 (Cressie, 

1994). 

Average Nearest Neighbor Ratio 

4 

 
The average nearest neighbor (ANN) ratio was initially developed to classify spatial patterns in 

plant  populations  (Clark  &  Evans,  1954).  In  this  context,  the  observation  locations  consist  of 

locations  of  observed  plants,  measured  as  coordinates  in  two-dimensional  space.  This  method 

quantifies the randomness (or lack thereof) among the observed point locations by measuring the 

distance from each point to its nearest neighbor and using these distances to compute the average 

nearest neighbor (ANN) ratio given by 

𝑅 =

𝑟̅𝑂
𝑟̅𝐸

(1) 

where 𝑟̅𝑂 =

𝑟𝑖

∑

𝑁
𝑖=1
𝑁

 , 𝑟𝑖 denotes the distance from the 𝑖𝑡ℎ individual to its nearest neighbor, 𝑁 denotes 

the total number of observations, 𝑟𝐸 =

1

2√𝜌

 is the expected value of 𝑟𝑂 under CSR for an infinite 

study area, 𝜌 =

𝑁

|𝐴|

 is the density of the observed distribution, and |𝐴| is the size of the study area. 

Under CSR, 𝐸(𝑅) = 1, and for a perfectly clustered distribution (i.e., all points fall at the same 

location),  𝐸(𝑅) = 0.  Values  of  𝑅  greater  than  1  indicate  that  the  points  are  distributed  more 

uniformly than expected under CSR, while values less than 1 indicate that the points are clustered.  

The standard approach to hypothesis testing using the ANN ratio assumes that the distribution of 

𝑟𝑂  under  the  null  hypothesis  of  CSR  is  approximately  normal.  A  z-score  for  the  statistic  is 

calculated by 

𝑧 =

𝑟̅𝑂 − 𝑟̅𝐸
𝜎𝑟̅𝐸

, 

(2) 

where  𝜎𝑟̅𝐸 is the standard error of the mean distance to the nearest neighbor under CSR. It can be 

shown that under CSR with an infinite study area, 𝜎𝑟̅𝐸 =

5 

0.26136

√𝑁𝜌

. A significantly negative z-score 

 
 
 
 
indicates  clustering,  and  a  significantly  positive  score  indicates  dispersion.  See  Figure  1  for 

examples of clustering, dispersion, and complete spatial randomness.   

Clark and Evans (1954) note some limitations of their procedure, such  as the sensitivity to  the 

chosen study area and inability to distinguish between certain types of spatial dependence (e.g., 

tightly clustered points in one place vs pairs of points scattered in population). In this situation, 

they suggest an extension to this measure by constructing a circle for each observation with an 

infinite  radius,  dividing  the  circle  into  equal  sectors,  and  measuring  the  distance  from  the 

individual to its nearest neighbor for each of the sectors. They also point out that problems may 

arise when the data consist of large areal units rather than points and the centroid of each unit is 

used to calculate the ANN ratio (Clark & Evans, 1954).  

In the areal data context, the observations consist of a set of areal units (e.g. counties, census tracts, 

etc.), with some subset of these units having some characteristic of interest (e.g. counties which 

imposed a mask mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic, census tracts deemed to be food deserts, 

etc.).  The ‘standard implementation’ of ANN-based hypothesis testing for such datasets (i.e. the 

approach taken by ESRI ArcGIS) is to map each areal unit to its centroid, compute the z-score 

given in Equation 2, and make a rejection decision by comparing this z-score to the quantiles of a 

standard  normal  distribution.      We  propose  an  alternate  ‘areal  implementation’  which 

acknowledges the underlying areal unit structure.  Under this approach, the null distribution of the 

ANN ratio z-score is estimated using Monte Carlo simulations where the data for each simulation 

is generated by randomly selecting 𝑁 observation locations from among the areal unit centroids.  

The ANN ratio z-score is computed for each dataset, empirical quantiles of the ANN ratio under 

the null distribution are calculated, and a decision is made by comparing the ANN ratio z-score 

from the observed dataset to these empirical quantiles.

Ripley’s K Function 

One of the limitations of the ANN method is its inability to test point patterns at different scales 

simultaneously (Ripley, 1977). For example, it is possible for data to be clustered at a small scale 

and  clustered  at  a  larger  scale  (i.e.,  the  clusters  are  clustered)  or  clustered  at  a  small  scale  but 

dispersed  at  a  large  scale  (i.e.,  the  clusters  occur  at  somewhat  regular  intervals).  Ripley’s  𝐾 

function  is  a  second-order  spatial  analysis  tool  (i.e.,  uses  variances  of  the  distances  between 

observations) that can address the issue of scale-dependent spatial patterns. Here we only consider 

Ripley’s 𝐾 function for univariate spatial patterns in two dimensions, but it can also be extended 

for multivariate spatial patterns (i.e.: comparing spatial patterns of two species) (Dixon, 2001).  

Let 𝑛𝑡(𝑠) denote the number of points within radius t at point s.  The function 𝐾 is given by 

𝐾(𝑡) =

𝐸(𝑛𝑡(𝑠))
𝜆

, 

where 𝜆 is the density (number of points per unit area) and can be estimated as 𝜆̂ =

𝑁

|𝐴|

, 𝑁 is the 

observed number of points and |𝐴| is the size of the study area. The expectation is taken over the 

point  locations.    If  the  points  follow  a  homogenous  Poisson  process  (i.e.,  exhibit  CSR),  then 

𝐾(𝑡) = 𝜋𝑡2 which is the area of a circle of radius 𝑡. An approximately unbiased estimator for 𝐾(𝑡) 

was proposed by Ripley (Dixon, 2001; Ripley, 1976): 

𝐾̂(𝑡) = 𝜆̂−1 ∑ ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑗

𝑗≠𝑖

𝑖

−1 𝐼(𝑑𝑖𝑗<𝑡)
, 

𝑁

(3) 

where 𝑑𝑖𝑗 is the distance between the 𝑖𝑡ℎ and 𝑗𝑡ℎ points, 𝐼(𝑑𝑖𝑗 < 𝑡) is the indicator function with 

the value of 1 if 𝑑𝑖𝑗 < 𝑡 and 0 otherwise, and 𝑤𝑖𝑗

−1 is a weight associated with locations 𝑖 and 𝑗 that 

corrects for edge effects. Correction for edge effects is required if any distance 𝑑𝑖𝑗 is greater than 

the distance between point 𝑖 and the boundary. Because the points outside the boundary are not 

7 

 
 
included in the calculation of 𝐾̂(𝑡), edge effects can lead to a biased estimator of 𝐾(𝑡). Various 

authors have proposed different edge corrections, such as buffer zones (Sterner, Ribic, & Schatz, 

1986; Szwagrzyk, 1990) or toroidal edge corrections (Ripley, 1979; Upton & Fingleton, 1985).  

One of the most commonly used edge corrections assigns 𝑤𝑖𝑗 a value of 1 if the circle centered at 

point 𝑖 which passes through point 𝑗 is entirely inside the study area and assigns 𝑤𝑖𝑗 equal to the 

proportion of the circumference of the circle that falls in the study area otherwise (Dixon, 2001). 

To test for CSR, the estimator 𝐿̂(𝑡) = [𝐾̂(𝑡)/𝜋]1/2 is sometimes used in practice, and 𝐸(𝐿̂(𝑡)) =

𝑡 under CSR (Ripley, 1979). If the observed value of 𝐾(𝑡) is larger than the expected value of 

𝐾(𝑡)  for  a  given  distance,  the  distribution  is  more  clustered  than  expected  under  CSR  at  that 

distance. If the observed value of 𝐾(𝑡) is smaller than the expected value of 𝐾(𝑡), the distribution 

is  more dispersed than  expected under  CSR  at  that  distance.    Usually, the distribution of  𝐾̂(𝑡) 

under the null hypothesis of CSR is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations, and critical values 

from the simulated distribution are used to define a rejection region for hypothesis testing. 

Computing Ripley’s K function can be computationally expensive for large datasets, as the number 

of  distances  between  each  pair  of  points  must  be  computed.    If  inference  is  required,  these 

computations must be repeated for each dataset generated in the Monte Carlo simulations.  Several 

computationally efficient methods have been suggested for use on large datasets.  Tang, Feng, and 

Jia (2015) develop a massively parallel algorithm which uses graphical processing units (GPUs) 

to compute Ripley’s K function for large datasets. G. Zhang, Huang, Zhu, and Keel (2016) propose 

two methods for computing  Ripley’s K which  combines  cloud computing  with  pre-sorting  and 

efficient storage to reduce computation time.  Wang et al. (2020) develop a distributed computing 

algorithm to compute Ripley’s K function for large spatial-temporal datasets using Apache Spark.  

In addition to these methods, a number of software packages exist which are suitable for computing 

8 

 
Ripley’s K on smaller datasets, including the Multi-distance Spatial Cluster Analysis Tool in ESRI 

ArcGIS  (Esri.  (2021b)),  the spatstat  package in  R (Baddeley & Turner,  2021), and the splancs 

package in R (Bivand et al., 2017). 

The ‘standard implementation’ of hypothesis testing using Ripley’s K for areal datasets (and the 

approach used by ESRI ArcGIS) is to map each areal unit to its centroid and compute 𝐾̂(𝑡) (or 

sometimes 𝐿̂(𝑡)) using the resulting set of points.  The null distribution of 𝐾̂(𝑡) is estimated using 

Monte Carlo simulations where each dataset consists of 𝑁 observation locations generated from a 

continuous uniform distribution on the study area, that is, the locations exhibit CSR.  Hypothesis 

testing proceeds by comparing the 𝐾̂(𝑡) value from the original dataset to the empirical quantiles 

from the Monte Carlo simulations.  We propose an alternate ‘areal implementation’ for performing 

hypothesis testing using Ripley’s K function.  Under this implementation, the null distribution is 

again  estimated  using  Monte  Carlo  simulations,  but  observation  locations  for  each  dataset  are 

generated by randomly selecting 𝑁 points from among all the areal unit centroids.  The 𝐾̂(𝑡) from 

the original dataset is then compared to the empirical quantiles from the Monte Carlo simulations 

to make a rejection decision. 

3 Simulations 

A  simulation  study  was  conducted  to  assess  the  performance  the  standard  and  areal 

implementations of hypothesis testing using ANN ratio and Ripley’s K function.  In this study, we 

consider three areal unit structures: structure 𝐴1 is a 20 × 20 regular grid where the units are of 

the  same  size,  structure  𝐴2  is  the  United  States  (US)  counties  in  the  states  of  North  Carolina, 

Tennessee,  South  Carolina,  Georgia,  Alabama,  and  Mississippi  where  the  units  (counties)  are 

roughly the same size but irregularly shaped, and structure 𝐴3 is the Canadian forward sortation 

9 

 
areas (FSAs) in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba where the units have vastly 

different sizes. Areal structures 𝐴1, 𝐴2, and 𝐴3 contain 𝑛1 = 400, 𝑛2 = 549, and 𝑛3 = 267 areal 

units, respectively. Observed data consists of a subset of the areal units presumed to have some 

characteristic of interest, and data generation consists of selecting this subset of units. We generate 

data under CSR and under two different types of clustering for two sample sizes. For each scenario, 

500 datasets are simulated. 

Data is generated by selecting the observed units from among the 𝑛𝑎 total units present in areal 

structure 𝐴𝑎. We consider two sample sizes for each areal structure: 𝑁 = ⌊

𝑛𝑎
10

⌋ and 𝑁 = ⌊

𝑛𝑎
4

⌋, and 

generate data under the null hypothesis of no spatial pattern (data generation mechanism (DGM) 

𝐷1) and under two alternative hypotheses: a single large cluster (DGM 𝐷2) and multiple smaller 

clusters (DGM 𝐷3). Under DGM 𝐷1, which corresponds to no spatial pattern, the observed units 

are selected via uniform sampling without replacement from among the 𝑛𝑎 total units. Under DGM 

𝐷2, which corresponds to the single cluster, units in a pre-selected region of the study area are 

sampled with 10 times higher probability than the units in the rest of the study area. The regions 

of higher probability are shown in  grey in  Figure  2.   DGM  𝐷3, which corresponds  to  multiple 

clusters, is an iterative process. First, an areal unit is selected via uniform random sampling, and 

this unit is observed, along with units which are directly adjacent to it. Another areal unit is then 

sampled without replacement from the remaining unobserved units and is observed along with all 

adjacent  units.  This  process  is  continued  until  𝑁  units  have  been  observed.  Examples  of  data 

generated  on  each  areal  structure  under  DGMs  𝐷1,  𝐷2  and  𝐷3  are  shown  in  Figures  3-5, 

respectively. 

The  ANN  ratio  is  calculated  by  using  the  centroids  of  the  observed  units  as  the  observation 

locations. The ANN ratio is known to be sensitive to the choice of the study area (often referred to 

10 

 
as the window); we consider two different methods for selecting the window: window 1 is the 

entire study area and window 2 is the smallest possible rectangle that encloses all the observed 

locations (note that window 2 is dependent on the observed data, while window 1 is not).  For the 

standard implementation of the ANN method, the null distribution of the test statistic is assumed 

to  be a standard normal  distribution.  For the areal  implementation,  the null distribution of the 

ANN ratio is estimated using 999 Monte Carlo simulations.  For both implementations, for DGM 

𝐷1 we perform an 𝛼 = 0.05 level two-tailed test by rejecting the null hypothesis if the test statistic 

is less than the 0.025 quantile or greater than the 0.975 quantile of the null distribution. For DGMs 

𝐷2 and 𝐷3, we perform a left-tailed test (indicative of clustering) by rejecting the null hypothesis 

if the test statistic falls below the 0.05 quantile of the estimated null distribution. 

Ripley’s K function was also evaluated using the centroids of the observed units as the observation 

locations.  For each areal structure, the performance of Ripley’s K function was evaluated at  a 

sequence of five radii, with the smallest radius equal to twice the smallest distance between any 

two unit centroids and the largest radius equal to one-quarter of the width of the study area. For 

each dataset, Ripley’s K function is evaluated at each radius using the Kest function in R (Baddeley 

& Turner, 2005) with the correction input as “Ripley”.  Under the standard implementation, the 

null  distribution  of  Ripley’s  K  function  at  each  radius  is  approximated  with  999  Monte  Carlo 

simulations,  where  the  𝑁  observation  locations  for  each  simulation  are  generated  from  a 

continuous  uniform  distribution  on  the  study  area.    Under  the  areal  implementation,  the  null 

distribution  of  Ripley’s  K  function  at  each  radius  is  approximated  with  999  Monte  Carlo 

simulations  where  the  𝑁  observation  locations  are  selected  at  random  from  the  𝑛𝐴  areal  unit 

centroid locations.  For both implementations, for DGM 𝐷1 we perform an 𝛼 = 0.05 level two-

tailed test for each radius 𝑟 by rejecting the null hypothesis if 𝐾̂(𝑡) is less than the 0.025 quantile 

11 

 
or greater than the 0.975 quantile of the null distribution. For DGMs 𝐷2 and 𝐷3, we perform a 

right-tailed test (indicative of clustering) by rejecting the null hypothesis if 𝐾̂(𝑡) exceeds the 0.95 

quantile of the Monte Carlo samples.  

We assess the performance via empirical type I error rate and empirical power. For simulations 

under the null hypothesis (𝐷1), we report the global empirical type I error rate for the ANN ratio 

and the empirical type I error rate at each radius for Ripley’s K function. For simulations under 

alternative hypotheses (𝐷2 and 𝐷3), we report the global empirical power for the ANN ratio and 

the empirical power at each radius for Ripley’s K function.  

4  Results 

Table 1 summarizes the empirical type I error rate (i.e., empirical probability of rejecting the null 

hypothesis of CSR when units are generated under CSR) and empirical power (i.e., the empirical 

probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of CSR when units  are clustered) of the ANN ratio 

under both implementations.  Under the standard implementation, the empirical type I error rate is 

inflated under all scenarios except the US counties under window 2.  The  inflation is generally 

more pronounced for the smaller sample size.  Under the areal implementation, the empirical type 

I error rate is at its nominal level.  However, the empirical power of the areal implementation is 

somewhat low (<50%) for all single cluster scenarios except the US counties under window 1.  

The empirical power for of the areal implementation under the multiple cluster scenarios is high 

(>90%) for the regular grid and the US counties, but somewhat lower (50-65%) for the Canadians 

FSAs.  In most scenarios, the empirical power of the areal implementation of the ANN methods is 

higher for window 1 (the entire study area) than window 2 (the smallest enclosing rectangle). 

12 

 
Table 2 summarizes the  empirical type  I error and  the empirical  power of Ripley’s K function 

under both implementations.  The empirical type I error rate of the standard implementation is far 

above its nominal level in all cases except for the Canadian FSAs under the smallest radius and 

smallest sample size.  The empirical type I error rate of the areal implementation is at or near its 

nominal  level  for  all  scenarios,  ranging  from  0.02  to  0.09.    The  empirical  power  of  the  areal 

implementation  is  high  for  most  of  the  single  cluster  scenarios,  with  the  notable  exception  of 

Canadian FSAs under the smallest radius.  The empirical power of the areal implementation for 

the multiple cluster scenario is quite high (>90%) for all radii and sample sizes for the regular grid.  

The empirical power of the areal implementation for the multiple cluster scenarios for the other 

two areal structures is highest for the second smallest radii with a notable decline as the radius 

increases.  Since the multiple clustering scenario consists of small clusters which are randomly 

dispersed (as opposed to large clusters or clusters of clusters), this is to be expected.   

5 Discussion and Conclusion 

The standard implementation of both  the ANN ratio and Ripley’s K function exhibits  a highly 

inflated empirical type I error rate for almost all scenarios considered in the simulation study.  This 

phenomenon likely occurs because centroids of the areal units do not arise from a homogeneous 

Poisson process under the null hypothesis.  As a result, the centroids of the observed units exhibit 

spatial patterns, even when those units are selected with uniform probability.  These findings call 

into question the reliability of the current ArcGIS implementation of ANN ratio and Ripley’s K 

function for areal data. 

The areal implementation of both methods, though imperfect, is far more reliable than the standard 

implementation.  The empirical type I error rate of the areal implementation for both the ANN 

ratio and Ripley’s K function maintains its nominal level across all scenarios.  The low power of 

13 

 
the areal implementation of the ANN method under most of the single clustering scenarios is likely 

due to the test statistic being an average of nearest neighbor distances.  The small nearest neighbor 

distances for observations in the cluster are offset by the larger neatest neighbor distances between 

units  outside  the  cluster,  resulting  in  a  less  extreme  test  statistic.    The  low  power  of  the  areal 

implementation of Ripley’s K function for the smallest radius for the Canadian FSAs suggests that 

the method may not reliably detect clustering at small distances if the areal units are vastly different 

sizes.  Recall that the smallest radius was twice the minimum distance between any two centroids.  

For  the  Canadian  FSAs,  only  6  (0.02%)  pairs  of  centroids  fell  within  this  distance,  while  52 

(0.03%) pairs of centroids fell within this distance for the US counties and 1482 (1.9%) pairs of 

centroids fell within this distance for the regular grid.  The power to detect multiple clustering at 

this  scale  appears  to  be  inversely  related  to  the  proportion  of  centroid  pairs  falling  within  the 

specified radius.  

These findings have important implications for the use of these methods on areal data.  An inflated 

type I error rate implies a high false discovery rate, meaning that researchers who have applied 

these methods to areal data may have wrongly concluded that their data exhibited a spatial pattern 

when  in  fact  it  does  not.    In  epidemiology,  this  may  manifest  as  the  discovery  of  non-existent 

disease  clusters  or  outbreaks.    In  ecology,  this  the  misapplication  of  these  methods  may  lead 

researcher to conclude that parcels of conserved land are clustering together to create larger, higher 

quality habitats, when in fact they are not.  In civil engineering and urban planning, the use of these 

methods  could  cause  researcher  to  conclude  that  parcels  of  land  designated  for  certain  uses 

(parking, recreation, open space, etc.) are well dispersed throughout an urban area when such is 

not the case. As ESRI ArcGIS software automatically applies the standard implementation of these 

methods  to  areal  data,  these  results  are  particularly  concerning  for  ESRI  users.  R  code  which 

14 

 
performs 

the 

areal 

implementation 

of 

both  methods 

is 

available 

at 

https://github.com/scwatson812/Areal_ANN_and_Ripleys_K.    The  integration  of  the  areal 

implementation  of  these  methods  into  ArcGIS  and  the  development  of  other  spatial  clustering 

detection methods which are better suited for areal data is an excellent area for future work.
