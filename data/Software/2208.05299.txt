In this work, we propose epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) nanoparticles formed of metal and dielectric
bilayers and employ the eﬀective medium approach for multilayered nanospheres to study their
optical response. We obtained a passive tunable ENZ region by varying the radii of the proposed
bilayer nanospheres, ranging from visible to near-IR. In addition, we present the absorption and
scattering cross-section of ENZ nanoparticles using an open-source, transfer-matrix-based software
(STRATIFY). The proposed ENZ nanoparticle is envisioned to be experimentally realized using
chemical synthesis techniques.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials exhibit a dielectric
permittivity approaching zero at a frequency close to the
material’s plasma frequency [1, 2]. Transparent conduc-
tive oxides such as indium tin oxide (ITO) are naturally
occurring ENZ materials with ENZ wavelengths in near-
infrared and mid-infrared regions [3]. A metamaterial
composed of alternating layers of metal and dielectric
was also demonstrated to exhibit ENZ properties in the
visible region [4, 5].

Notably, ENZ materials studied by many authors con-
sist of nanostructures or meta-atoms, which require fab-
rication techniques such as focused ion beam (FIB)
milling, laser ablation, atomic layer deposition (ALD),
and electron-beam (e-beam) lithography [6, 7]. On the
other hand, the synthesis of nanoparticles (NPs) and
their incorporation into materials are among the most
studied topics in chemistry, physics, and material sci-
ence. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that local-
ized surface plasmon (LSPR) depends on the size, shape,
and material of the nanoparticles. For example, small Au
NPs (between 5 and 10 nm) have the LSPR band around
520 nm, while for bigger particles (between 50 and 100
nm), this peak is red-shifted up to 570 nm. Other mate-
rials such as TCOs, transition metal nitrides [8], organic
conductive materials [9], and highly doped semiconduc-

tors have also been identiﬁed to exhibit plasmonic behav-
ior at diﬀerent spectral regions.

In addition, nanoparticles composed of a metal-
dielectric complex have shown to exhibit interesting
light-matter interactions with many vital applications in
physics and chemistry, such as scattering [10, 11] and
nonlinear optics [12, 13], sensing [14, 15], ﬂuorescence
[16, 17], and up-conversion enhancement [18], surface
plasmon ampliﬁcation [19, 20], hydrogen generation [21],
and solar energy harvesting [22, 23].

Although planar ﬁlms made of similar materials have
been investigated as ENZ medium for many applications,
nanoparticles have not been considered ENZ materials.
We envision that the ENZ nanoparticles could provide a
new design solution for low-cost tunable ENZ materials,
which have wide prospects for application in photonics.
In this work, we propose the possibility of the utiliza-
tion of nanoparticles as ENZ materials. To verify this
approach, we employ the eﬀective medium approach to
model the optical response of a multilayer sphere as an
eﬀective bulk spherical medium. In particular, by vary-
ing the structural properties of the nanospheres, we show
how the ENZ character of such multilayered nanoparti-
cles can be easily tuned from the visible (VIS) to the
near-IR (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

II. STRUCTURE DESIGN AND MODELING

The ENZ nanoparticles we considered in this work, are
bi-layer structures consisting of an inner dielectric core,
for which we employ silicon dioxide (SiO2), and an outer

of eﬀective media to simplify the complex problem of a
multi-layered spherical nanoparticle, reducing it to the
simpler one of a single, homogeneous spherical nanopar-
ticle, described via an eﬀective permittivity.

For the case of a metal-dielectric nanoparticle as the
one depicted in Fig. 1, for example, this can be eas-
ily done using standard methods of electrostatics, ie., by
placing the nanoparticle in a homogeneous electric ﬁeld
and solving the Laplace equation for the electrostatic po-
tential in the whole space [28]. By using this procedure,
one can easily show that the electric ﬁeld generated by
the bilayered sphere in the host medium (air, in the case
of Fig. 1) is the same as that of a single sphere with
radius a1 and permittivity

with (cid:15)1 being the permittivity of the shell, (cid:15)2 the permit-
tivity of the core, and a2 the radius of the inner sphere.
The above theory can then be generalized for multilay-
ered structures by expressing the multilayered permittiv-
ities by simply applying Eq. (1) recursively to each cou-
ple of layers, from the outer to the inner one [27], thus
obtaining, for the general k-th layer

Here, the layers are numbered from outside to inside so
that k = 1 represents the outer layer and k = N rep-
resents the inner one. The permittivity for each layer
k = {N − 1, N − 2, ..., 2, 1} is expressed using the above
equations.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

From the above theory, we determined the eﬀective
permittivity for the proposed spherical bilayer structure
to obtain the ENZ points as a function of the varied
core diameters with outer layer thicknesses ﬁxed at 2 nm.
Figure 2 shows the eﬀective permittivities for the diﬀer-
ent ENZ nanoparticles with diﬀerent core diameters (i.e.,
a2,1 = {38, 40}, a2,1 = {68, 70}, and a2,1 = {98, 100}
nm, respectively). a2,1 represents the radii of the inner
and outer shells, respectively. We obtained diﬀerent ENZ
points by changing the radii of the bilayer nanospheres.
In particular, for a2,1 = {38, 40} nm [Fig. 2(a)], the
ENZ wavelength is found to be λEN Z ≈ 659 nm. Simi-
larly, by changing the inner and outer radii of the ENZ

with

metallic shell, as shown schematically in Fig. 1. Due
to the high carrier concentration, electron mobility, and
strong electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁnement property of no-
ble metals [24], we choose silver (Ag) for the outer shell.
To analyze the absorption and scattering of the afore-
mentioned ENZ nanoparticles, we use a transfer-matrix
approach (based on the open-source STRATIFY code
[25]). As a sanity check, we also implemented the opti-
cal response (i.e., scattering and absorption) for diﬀerent
materials and identiﬁed that the Ag-SiO2 bilayer struc-
ture gives us the required ENZ region of interest (i.e.,
visible to NIR). First, we focused on the eﬀective ENZ
optical responses of a bi-layer spherical nanoparticle em-
bedded within a host medium (i.e., air), and later ex-
tended the eﬀective permittivity approach to multilayer
nanosphere composites.

The wavelength-dependent complex dielectric func-
tions for Ag and SiO2 were taken from the material data
of Johnson and Christy [26]. The scattering, absorption,
and electromagnetic near-ﬁeld distribution are calculated
using STRATIFY (i.e., recursive transfer matrix method
(RTMM) MATLAB code).

III. THEORY

In this section, we brieﬂy present the theoretical back-
ground needed to derive the eﬀective permittivity of the
bi-layer spherical nanoparticle. Our approach makes use
of an eﬀective description of the electric permittivity of a
metal-dielectric layered nanoparticle, following the meth-
ods presented in Ref.
In particular, we assume
that a bilayer (and, by simple generalization, a multi-
layer) nanoparticle can be seen as a composite material,
where the outer layer (the shell) plays the role of the
host medium, whereas the inner layer (the core) is the
inclusion. This assumption allows us to use the theory

27.

nanoparticle, we observe a redshift of the ENZ wave-
length to λEN Z ≈ 852 nm [Fig. 2(b)] and λEN Z ≈ 1010
nm [Fig. 2(c)], respectively. This is the ﬁrst main result
of our work which extends to the numerical calculations
of the nanosphere’s near-ﬁeld enhancement, absorption
and scattering cross-sections, as well as, exploiting the
possibility of using the eﬀective medium formulations of
bilayer nanospheres into multilayer ENZ nanoparticles.

Ag-SiO2 nanoparticles clearly show ENZ behavior in
the VIS and NIR spectral regime. The position of the
ENZ wavelength of such nanoparticles can be easily con-
trolled by suitably tuning the inner core of the nanoparti-
cle. In our simulations, it was found that the outer radius
of the nanoparticle must obey the rule a1 =< λEN Z/10
for the eﬀective medium approach to remain valid.
In
addition, it was identiﬁed that one should consider the
parametric variations of the inner core and outer shell of
the nanoparticles, as huge thickness variations between
the two layers could aﬀect the bilayer nanoparticle from
exhibiting ENZ properties. This is due to the bilayer
nanoparticle exhibiting properties of the outer shell in-
stead of the complex media. As such, it is relevant to

choose the right ﬁll fraction of the nanoparticle to attain
the required ENZ properties.

To verify the reliability of the eﬀective medium ap-
proach described above, we compare the electromagnetic
ﬁeld distribution of the proposed eﬀective medium the-
ory and the bilayer structure. As it can be seen from
Fig. 3, the electric ﬁeld distribution outside the nanopar-
ticle, calculated using STRATIFY, for both the case of
a bi-layer structure [Fig. 3(a)] and a bulk sphere with
eﬀective permittivity (cid:15)ef f [Fig. 3(b)] at the ENZ wave-
length, give relatively similar results, as can be seen
from Fig. 3(c). Moreover, our numerical simulation in-
crease in performance when using the eﬀective medium
approximation instead of the full bilayer structure of the
nanoparticle. We also identiﬁed that a bilayer metal-
dielectric structure is suﬃcient to obtain the desired
ENZ properties. As a result, we focused on the parti-
cle with radius a2,1 = {98, 100} nm which can produce
Rayleigh scattering since the particle size is smaller than
the wavelength of the impinging electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Although a full numerical optimization could be per-
formed, we only considered the ENZ nanoparticle with

4

the ﬁlling ratio of the ENZ nanoparticle, a passive tun-
ing of the λEN Z can be observed, which corroborates the
shift in the nanoparticle’s peak absorbance and scattering
cross-sections. Intuitively, the redshift of the peak in the
dipole resonance with increasing size could be linked to
the weakening of their restoring force. Since the distance
between charges on opposite sides of the ENZ nanopar-
ticle increases with size, in fact, their corresponding in-
teraction decrease.

radius a2,1 = {98, 100} nm, as it shows the capabilities
of our approach shown in Fig. 3 and corresponds to ex-
perimentally plausible nanoparticles [29].

In addition, we numerically calculated the fundamental
extinction cross-sections and the ENZ-dependent para-
metric sweep for diﬀerent layers of the ENZ nanoparticle
in the case of a plane wave incident on it using the eﬀec-
tive medium formulation. Figures 4 (a) and (b) show the
absorption and scattering cross-sections for the three dif-
ferent ENZ nanoparticles, i.e., a2,1 = {38, 40} nm (blue),
a2,1 = {68, 70} nm (green), and a2,1 = {98, 100} nm
(red), with absorption and scattering peak resonances
at λ ≈ 913 nm, 1206 nm, and 1466 nm, respectively.
The maximum extinction resonance wavelengths for the
proposed ENZ nanoparticles are redshifted, compared to
their characteristic ENZ wavelengths which are presented
in Table I.

This is due to the resonant excitation of dipole surface
plasmons on the ENZ nanoparticle. We note, in fact, that
the obtained resonance enhancement for both scattering
and absorption cross-section occurs when the condition
εef f ≈ −2 (the so-called Fr¨ohlich condition) for spherical
nanoparticles is satisﬁed [30]. The absorption and scat-
tering for the ENZ nanoparticle a2,1 = {98, 100} nm has
appreciably similar peak values. However, for the ENZ
nanoparticle a2,1 = {38, 40} nm and a2,1 = {68, 70} nm,
we obtained a relatively low scattering peak values, as
compared to its corresponding absorption cross-section
peak values. It is also interesting to note that by changing

In addition to the absorption and scattering cross-
section of the ENZ nanoparticles, we numerically calcu-
lated the ENZ wavelengths for diﬀerent layered nanopar-
ticles by parametrically varying the thickness of SiO2
overlayed on the outer Ag shell. The SiO2 inner core
and the Ag layers in between are ﬁxed with a radius of
a2 = {98} nm and a thickness of 2 nm.
It is evident
in Fig. 5 that by changing the thicknesses of the em-
bedded SiO2 layers, we attain diﬀerent ENZ wavelengths
for the diﬀerent multilayered nanoparticles. For all the
considered nanostructures, we see a linear trend that de-
picts that by varying the thicknesses of the SiO2 layers,
there is a corresponding shift in λEN Z for diﬀerent lay-
ered structures. This signiﬁes the possibility of extending
the eﬀective medium formulation of bilayered structure
into multilayered nanoparticles.

Our work shows that eﬀective medium theory is poten-
tially applicable to bilayer spherical nanoparticles to de-
termine their unique spectral responses and ENZ proper-
ties. By changing the diameter of the ENZ nanoparticle,
we identiﬁed a spectral shift in the spectral absorbance
and scattering cross-sections of the ENZ nanoparticle
which signiﬁes a passive tuning of the proposed struc-
ture. The eﬀective permittivity formulation works rela-
tively well for bilayer structures and could be easily ex-
tended to multilayered structures as shown in subsequent
discussions. The electric near-ﬁeld response for both the
bilayer and the eﬀective medium structures shows similar
near-ﬁeld optical responses. Our proposed ENZ nanopar-
ticle can be obtained by low-cost chemical synthesis tech-
niques to be utilized in applications that grasp the advan-
tage of ENZ properties as well nanoparticle properties.
