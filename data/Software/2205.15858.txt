Abstract   
Nowadays, many people worldwide suffer from brain disorders, and their health is in danger. So far, 
numerous methods have been proposed for the diagnosis of Schizophrenia (SZ) and attention deficit 
hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD),  among  which  functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI) 
modalities are known as a popular method among physicians. This paper presents an SZ and ADHD 
intelligent detection method of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) modality using a new deep learning (DL) 
method.  The  University  of  California  Los  Angeles  (UCLA)  dataset,  which  contains  the  rs-fMRI 
modalities of SZ  and  ADHD  patients, has been used for experiments. The  FMRIB  software library 
(FSL)  toolbox  first  performed  preprocessing  on  rs-fMRI  data.  Then,  a  convolutional  Autoencoder 
(CNN-AE) model with the proposed number of layers is used to extract features from rs-fMRI data. In 
the classification step, a new fuzzy method called interval type-2 fuzzy regression (IT2FR) is introduced 
and  then  optimized  by  genetic  algorithm  (GA),  particle  swarm  optimization  (PSO),  and  gray  wolf 
optimization  (GWO) techniques. Also,  the  results of  IT2FR  methods are  compared with  multilayer 
perceptron (MLP), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), 
decision  tree  (DT),  and  adaptive  neuro-fuzzy  inference  system  (ANFIS)  methods.  The  experiment 
results show that the IT2FR method with the GWO optimization algorithm has achieved satisfactory 
results compared to other classifier methods. Finally, the proposed classification technique was able to 
provide 72.71% accuracy.

1. Introduction  
The human brain consists of a complex and large network of neurons responsible for controlling and 
monitoring  all  parts  of  the  body  [1-2].  The  brain  network  has  different  areas  that  are  constantly 
connected.  To  perform  any  function  in  the  body,  many  neurons  in  different  parts  of  the  brain  are 
connected and coordinated, creating complex brain patterns [3-4]. Whenever connectivity is not well-
connected in different areas of the brain, it can cause changes in the function of the brain and disorders 
such as ADHD [5], SZ [6-7], epilepsy [8-10], and Parkinson's disease (PD) [11]. Initially, the diagnosis 
of  various  brain  disorders was  based  on  the  DSM.  The  experience  of  a  specialist  physician  plays  a 
critical role in diagnosing the type of brain disorder [12-13]. Therefore, examining and diagnosing the 
type of brain disorder is not possible for all physicians [14]. For example, ADHD has some of the same 
symptoms as other brain disorders, such as PD and SZ, and is difficult for some specialists to diagnose 
[15-16]. 

 
 
 
 
To overcome these challenges, functional neuroimaging modalities have been developed to diagnose a 
variety  of  brain  disorders  that are  highly  popular  with  physicians  [17-18].  Functional neuroimaging 
modalities  include  electroencephalography  (EEG)  [19],  fMRI  [20],  positron  emission  tomography 
(PET)  [21],  single-photon  emission  computed  tomography  (SPECT)  [22],  magnetoencephalography 
(MEG) [23]  and  functional  near-infrared spectroscopy  (fNIRS)  [24].  FMRI  modalities  are  the  most 
important  non-invasive  techniques  for  assessing  brain  function  during  brain  disorders  [20].  fMRI 
includes task fMRI (T-fMRI) and rs-fMRI modalities and shows spatial resolution in the brain, making 
fMRI modalities popular for examining functional connectivity in different parts of the brain [25]. The 
fMRI data contains a 4-dimensional tensor so that the 3D volume of the brain is segmented into small 
areas, and the activity of each area is recorded for a certain period of time [25]. In this modality, the 
two  brain  regions  are  functionally  related  if  they  have  simultaneous  functional  activity  [25].  FMRI 
modalities have been used to analyze brain connectivity patterns in diagnosing various brain disorders 
by physicians and have yielded promising results [26-28]. 
In  recent  years,  studies  have  shown  that  functional  connectivity  analysis  based  on  fMRI  modalities 
plays a significant role in the diagnosis of brain disorders such as  SZ [6], Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
[29], epilepsy [30-31], ADHD [5], and BD [32]. Brain disorders alter functional connectivity in the 
brain,  which  can  be  seen  by  fMRI  modalities.  However,  diagnosis  of  brain  disorders  with  fMRI 
modalities  is  a  difficult  and  time-consuming  task  for  physicians  [25].  For  example,  ADHD  is  a 
developmental disorder with some of the same symptoms as other brain disorders such as PD and SZ 
[7], making it difficult for physicians to diagnose the type of brain disorder. To address these challenges, 
in  recent  years,  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  methods  have  been  used  to  diagnose  a  variety  of  brain 
disorders from fMRI data, and researchers are trying to create working tools to diagnose these diseases 
[33-34]. In this paper, the authors aim to present a new DL-based method for the simultaneous diagnosis 
of SZ and ADHD, so a brief description of SZ and ADHD is provided below. 
SZ is a severe and chronic mental disorder characterized by impaired thinking, perception, and behavior. 
In addition, SZ causes psychosis, which is associated with significant disability [7]. DSM-5 is a guide 
for assessing and diagnosing mental disorders [12-13]. According to the DSM-5, two or more of the 
symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, 
and negative symptoms must frequently occur over one month [12-13]. Numerous factors in SZ include 
genetic factors, environmental factors, and brain structure and function. While there is still no cure for 
SZ, research has led to more innovative and safer treatments. Researchers are also trying to diagnose 
the disease and identify its causes by studying and conducting research and using fMRI neuroimaging 
techniques to study the function of the brain. 
ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is very common between ages 3 and 6 in children [35-
36]. ADHD includes three types of inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, and a combination of the two 
[35-36]. ADHD always causes many challenges for children, including forgetting simple things, talking 
non-stop,  being  distracted,  etc.  [35].  ADHD  has  different  symptoms  for  each  person.  Therefore,  its 
accurate diagnosis is challenging for specialist doctors [36]. 
Nowadays, a lot of research is being done to diagnose brain disorders using DL techniques [37-39]. The 
DL models are inspired by the human nervous system, which consists of several interconnected layers 
of nonlinear processing units called artificial neurons [40-42]. One of the advantages of DL networks 
is  their  ability  to  directly  process  large  raw  data  or  data  with  little  preprocessing  on  them  to 
automatically extract the best features for the task [40-42].  
So far, various researches have been done on diagnosing SZ [7] and ADHD [43] using fMRI modalities 
and DL techniques. The main purpose of these pieces of research is to increase the performance for SZ 
or ADHD detection using MRI modalities. In addition, the researchers hope to be able to provide  a 
working DL-based tool for the diagnosis of SZ and ADHD in the future. Further details of these studies 

 
are summarized in Table (6). However, among the presented studies, simultaneous diagnosis of SZ and 
ADHD from fMRI data using DL techniques has not been performed. 
This paper presents a new method for SZ and ADHD detection in rs-fMRI modality using 2D-CNN-
AE and IT2FR-GWO methods. First, rs-fMRI data from the UCLA dataset were used for SZ and ADHD 
detection  [44].  In  the  following,  the  FSL  [45]  toolbox  is  used  to  preprocess  rs-fMRI  data.  The 
preprocessing performed on rs-fMRI data includes various steps that are discussed in detail in the next 
section of this manuscript. Afterward, a CNN-AE model with the proposed layers is used to  extract 
features  from  preprocessed  fMRI  data.  Finally,  the  classification  of  features  is  done  by  different 
classifier methods, namely, DT [57], MLP [46], KNN [47], SVM [48], RF [49], ANFIS [50], ANFIS-
GA, ANFIS-PSO, ANFIS-GWO, IT2FR-GA, IT2FR-PSO, and IT2FR-GWO. In this step, the IT2FR 
technique is introduced as a pioneering work and optimized using GA [51], PSO [52], and WGO [53] 
optimization algorithms. Also, combining the IT2FR with WGO is another novelty of this paper. 
In the following, other sections of the paper are described. The second section introduces the proposed 
method of SZ detection from rs-fMRI data and the CNN-AE model. The third section is dedicated to 
the introduction of evaluation parameters. In the fourth section, the test results of the proposed method 
are presented. Finally, the discussion, conclusions, and future work are presented in the fifth section. 

2. Proposed Method  
The proposed methods for SZ and ADHD  detection from rs-fMRI modalities are introduced in this 
section. In Figure (1), the steps of the proposed method are shown in the form of a diagram. First, the 
UCLA dataset containing rs-fMRI modalities was used. In the second step, preprocessing is performed 
on rs-fMRI data using FSL software. This step is based on standard preprocessing methods for rs-fMRI 
modalities. The following is proposed feature extraction method based on the CNN-AE architecture 
with the suggested number of layers. Finally, various classification algorithms including MLP, KNN, 
SVM,  RF,  ANFIS,  ANFIS-GA,  ANFIS-PSO,  ANFIS-GWO,  IT2FR-GA,  IT2FR-PSO,  and  IT2FR-
GWO are used. In the following, each of these sections is presented.

2.1. Dataset  
We used the data introduced in [1] available in [44]. The dataset includes data from 138 healthy subjects 
as well as samples of individuals diagnosed with Schizophrenia (58), Bipolar I disorder (49), and ADHD 
(45). Additional information about the dataset (sex, age and etc.) can be found in [1]. A sample of 60 
subjects from the control, SZ (58 subjects), and ADHD cohort (45 subjects) was used in this study. 
Figure (2) depicts some samples of rs-fMRI data from the UCLA dataset. 
Images were acquired using a 3T Siemens Trio scanner. rs-fMRI data with a length of 304 seconds 
(eyes-open)  was  collected  from  each  subject  using  T2*-weighted  echo-planar  imaging  (EPI)  pulse 
sequence with parameters: axial slices, number of slices=34, slice thickness=4mm, TR=2s, TE=30ms, 
ﬂip angle=90°, matrix=64×64, FOV=192×192 mm2. Also, a T1-weighted high-resolution anatomical 
scan (MPRAGE) was acquired from each subject with the following parameters: sagittal slices, number 
of slices=176, slice thickness=1mm, TR=1.9s, TE=2.26ms, matrix=256×256, FOV=250×250 mm2.

2.2. Preprocessing  
All  preprocessing  steps  were  conducted  using  the  FSL  software  [45].  A  general  overview  of  the 
preprocessing steps can be seen in figure (3) and are as follow: 

•  Eliminating non-brain regions from the T1 high-resolution images using BET  
•  Eliminating the first 5 volume images to allow for magnetization equilibrium 
•  Applying a temporal Gaussian high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.01 HZ 
•  Applying motion correction using FSLs MCFLIRT  
•  Applying interleaved slice timing correction 
•  Applying a spatial Gaussian low-pass filter with FWHM = 5mm 
•  Registering all images to standard space (MNI152_T1_2mm) 

The outcome of the main preprocessing steps (filtering and registration) on a sample image can be seen 
in figures (4) and (5).

2.2.1. Connectivity 
The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to estimate the functional connectivity between regions. 
Regions  of  interest  (ROI)  were  defined  according  to  the  Harvard-Oxford  cortical  and  sub-cortical 
(lateralized) atlas. Based on this atlas, a total of 118 ROIs were considered. Next, regional time series 
were  obtained  by  averaging  the  time  series  of  all  voxels  inside  each  of  the  118  ROIs.  Finally,  the 
Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series was used to extract the connectivity matrices for 
each subject. In conclusion, a connectivity matrix with a shape of 118×118 is obtained. Figures (6) to 
(8) demonstrate connectivity heat maps from healthy control (HC) and SZ subjects.

2.3. Proposed CNN-AE Model  
The introduction of DL techniques in various fields, including medicine [25-30], has made significant 
progress, and valuable results have been achieved in detecting different diseases [33-34]. So far, several 
models of DL techniques have been proposed, with different training schemes, including supervised, 
semi-supervised, and unsupervised methods [54-55]. Autoencoders (AEs) are an important class of DLs 
trained unsupervised and are widely used for feature extraction [55-56]. AE architectures consist of two 
important parts: decoder and encoder [55]. 

Fig. 9. Proposed CNN-AE model for diagnosis of SZ from rs-fMRI modality.

AEs have different architectures [55], and the idea of this paper is based on the CNN-AE technique 
with the proposed layers. In the proposed model, first, the connectivity matrices are fed to the input of 
the  encoder  section.  Then,  it  passes  through  the  convolutional  layers  to  reach  the  last  layer  of  the 
encoder. Afterwards, this data is entered into the decoder, which aims to perform data reconstruction. 
This paper uses seven convolutional layers in the encoder and decoder. Figure (9) and Table (1) detail 
the proposed CNN-AE model.

2.4. Classifiers  
To  use  an  autoencoder for  feature  extraction, first, the  decoder  part  is  deleted. Next,  a  dense  layer 
followed by a SoftMax classifier is inserted after the encoder, and the encoder is fine-tuned. Afterward, 
the representations from the last convolutional layer (last layer of the encoder) are extracted as features 
for each image. Figure (10) shows the overall structure of the fine-tuned network. After performing 
these steps, different classifier methods can be used. In this paper, the used classification algorithms 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consist  of  MLP,  KNN,  SVM,  RF,  ANFIS,  ANFIS-GA,  ANFIS-PSO,  ANFIS-GWO,  IT2FR-GA, 
IT2FR-PSO, and IT2FR-GWO. In the following, the details of classifier algorithms are presented.  

Fig. 10. AE-based Classifier block diagram.  

1. Machine learning classifiers  
To compare the results of the proposed method and show its superiority, a number of classification 
algorithms are picked and evaluated on the dataset. Decision trees (DT) [57], KNN [47], MLP [46], 
SVM [48] and Random Forest [49] are used as baselines. These methods have different complexities, 
and each has its own strength and weaknesses; for example, random forest is fast and robust against 
outliers but tends to fail where features are highly entangled, whereas SVM with the proper kernel can 
solve those  problems,  but  its  performance  decreases for  massive  datasets.  Moreover,  some  of  these 
methods have hyper-parameters, k in KNN and kernel in SVM; these values are picked as three and 
RBF, respectively. 

2. ANFIS Models  
Nowadays,  various  applications  use  fuzzy  systems,  including  medical  data  classification  [50].  The 
ANFIS  model  is  one  of  the  most  popular  classification  methods,  which  combines  fuzzy  logic  and 
adaptive network. More information about the ANFIS method is given in [50]. In this work, the Genfis-
3 function is used to implement ANFIS based on the FCM clustering algorithm. This function uses the 
Gaussian membership function for input data. Finally, the training step is based on the hybrid method. 
In [50], ANFIS model training with intelligent optimization methods is presented, and we have done 
the same in this research. 
3. Improving Type-2 Fuzzy Regression Based on TSK 
Linear regression (LR) has been extensively utilized in many applications, such as the medical one [58-
59]. According to the definition of LR, there will be a linear relationship between independent variables 
and  the  dependent  variable.  LR-based  approaches  are  among  well-known and  widely  used  machine 
learning tools (ML) [60]. 
Due  to  uncertainty in medical  data  and  the capability  of  Fuzzy  Logic  Systems  (FLSs) in  modelling 
uncertainties, Type-1 and Type-2 Fuzzy Regression methods have been proposed, which have more 
potential and efficiency to outperform LR techniques . 
Moreover, taking advantage of additional degrees of freedom provided by the footprint of uncertainty 
(FOU), Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems (IT2 FLSs) are able to effectively handle the high levels 
of uncertainty in comparison with T1 FLS [61].  
The following definitions will be presented before analyzing the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Regression (IT2 
FR). 
Definition 1[62]: The T2FS is represented by a type-2 membership function  𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥, 𝑢) as follows: 

 
 
 
 
𝐴̃ = {((𝑥, 𝑢), 𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥, 𝑢))|∀𝑥 ∈ 𝑋, ∀𝑢 ∈ 𝐽𝑥 ⊆ [0,1]} 

(1) 

where 𝑥  is the primary variable in 𝑋, 𝑢 is the second variable which has the domain 𝐽𝑥 ⊆ [0,1], and the 
amplitude of 𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥, 𝑢) is known as the second grade. The T2FS can also denoted as: 

𝐴̃ = ∫𝑥∈𝑋∫𝜇∈𝐽𝑥

⁄
𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥, 𝑢) (𝑥, 𝑢)

Definition 2: The footprint of uncertainty (FOU) of a T2FS 𝐴̃ is defined as 

𝐴̃ = {(𝑥, 𝑢)|𝑥 ∈ 𝑋, 𝑢 ∈ [𝑢𝐴̃, 𝑢𝐴̃]} 

(2) 

(3) 

Definition  3[62]:  Due  to  the  complexity  and  abstraction  of  T2FS,  IT2FS  is  defined  by  setting  all 
𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥, 𝑢) = 1, which can be shown as 

𝐴̃ = ∫𝑥∈𝑋∫𝜇∈𝐽𝑥

1 (𝑥, 𝑢)

⁄

The 𝑖th IF-THEN rule of T2 FLSs is expressed by 

𝑖𝑓 𝑥1 𝑖𝑠 𝐴̃1

𝑖  𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑥2 𝑖𝑠 𝐴̃2

𝑖  𝑎𝑛𝑑, … , 𝑥𝑛 𝑖𝑠 𝐴̃𝑛

𝑖 , 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑦𝑖 = 𝐺̃ 𝑖,

(4) 

(5) 

𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑀 

where 𝐴̃
𝑖(𝑗 = 1, … 𝑛) are antecedent type-2 sets, 𝐺̃ 𝑖 are consequent type-2 sets. Further studies about 
𝑗
the structure of T2FLSs and their applications are proposed in [63].  Figure (11) demonstrates that IT2 
FS could adopt the Gaussian MFs for its premise parts. 
Definition  4  [62]:  Gaussian  IT2FS  is  a  special  case  of  IT2FS  which  has  a  fixed  mean  (𝑚),  and  an 
uncertain standard deviation that takes on values in [𝜎1, 𝜎2]. The lower membership function (LMF) 
𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥) and Upper membership function (UMF) 𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥) of the Gaussian IT2FS are expressed as follows: 

𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥) = 𝑒

When data in a regression problem follow an almost certain linear trend in a region, linear regression 
methods  will  be  efficient.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  linear  trend  does  not  exist,  piecewise  linear 
regression is employed. The number and location of breakpoints need to be detected in the estimation 
process. This issue raises complexity and additionally leads to an algorithm whose behavior changes 
due to added data. This issue could be the leading cause of repeating all calculations. 
In this section, IT2 FR is developed to overcome the abovementioned difficulty. Moreover, this method 
will be independent of the behavior of a trend in a data set. For IT2FR, output 𝑌𝑖 is defined by an interval 
type-2 fuzzy linear model in which 𝐴̃𝑗 and 𝑋𝑗

(𝑖) are fuzzy coefficients and crisp inputs: 

𝑌̃𝑖 = 𝐴̃1𝑋1

(𝑖) + ⋯ + 𝐴̃𝑛𝑋𝑛

(𝑖) = ∑ 𝐴̃𝑗𝑋𝑗

(𝑖)

(8) 

𝑗=1

The above equation does not apply to data with various behavior patterns. To solve this problem, data 
with similar behavior will be allocated to a cluster, then linear IT2FR will be used for each cluster. In 
analyzing new data, if new data is placed in the existing clusters, only that particular cluster will be 
trained. Otherwise, a new cluster will be generated, and IT2FR associated with this cluster is studied. 
As a result, the previous calculations are valid, while new behavior patterns are also investigated with 
minimum computational cost. 
Assume  that  𝑁  and  𝑀  are  the  number  of  data  and  clusters,  respectively,  for  𝑟th  cluster  with  𝑀𝑟 
members, the following rule could be expressed: 

𝑖𝑓 𝑥1

In fact, one rule is defined for each cluster in which 𝐹̃𝑗

8. Optimal IT2FR Classifiers  
Fuzzy c-mean clustering (FCM) method [50] is the most useful approach to generating a primary fuzzy 
inference  system  (FIS)  among  the  ANFIS  and  IT2FR  classifiers.  In  FIS,  direct  learning  methods 
influence the Gaussian membership functions (MFs), inputs, and outputs of FIS. This section employs 
PSO, GA, and GWO methods to train IT2FR and ANFIS models. Firstly, based on FCM, the proposed 
FR model obtains T1 and T2 Gaussian MFs, and then optimization algorithms are used to decrease the 
error. Finally, the objective function is defined by [50]:

where 𝑁 and 𝑒𝑖 are the number of FS inputs and error, respectively. 𝑥𝑖 are inputs (features) [50]. 𝜃, 𝑛, 
and 𝑦𝑖 denote the IT2FR and ANFIS method parameters, the number of samples, and the output of FS, 
respectively.  

A)  Genetic Algorithm  
The  genetic  algorithm  (GA)  is  one  of  the  most  important  optimization  methods  developed  by  John 
Holland [51]. This algorithm starts with a set of chromosomes called populations. Chromosomes are 
taken  from  a  population  and  used  as  a  new  population.  Then,  the  hypothesis  begins  with  a  unique 
random  population  and  continues  through  generations  [51].  The  fitness  of  the  whole  population  is 
assessed  in  each  generation.  Several  individuals  are  randomly  selected  from  the  current  generation 
(based on fitness) and modified to form a new generation, and in the next iteration, the algorithm is 
converted to the current generation [51]. You can find more information on GA in [51]. 
B) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) 
The  PSO  optimizes  a  problem  by  trying  iteratively  to  enhance  a  candidate  solution to  an  estimated 
quality in computational science [52]. It moves the particles in the search space using a mathematical 
formula over the particle’s velocity and position. The local best-known position influences the particle's 
movement, but the best-known positions in the search space also guide them. Hence, the better positions 
found by other particles are also updated. This makes the swarm move toward the best solutions [52]. 
One  of  the  most  significant  advantages  of  this  algorithm  is  that  it  does  not  use  the  gradient  of  the 
problem  being  optimized,  eliminating  all  the  overheads  of  gradient  calculation  and  derivative 
computation. Nevertheless, given the nature of the local search, it does not guarantee an optimal solution 
[52].  

C) Gray Wolf Optimization 
The  GWO  algorithm  was  first  proposed  in  2014  by  Mirjalili  et  al.  [53].  GWO  is  a  metaheuristic 
optimization method inspired by how gray wolves hunt [53]. This technique is in the category of swarm 
intelligence algorithms, and it is based on population. Gray wolves are known as predators, and most 
of  them  often  prefer  to  live  in  groups  [53].  Each  group  consists  of  5  to  12  wolves  on  average  in  a 
hierarchical manner. This hierarchy is divided into four categories: alpha (group leaders), beta (advisors 
and  orders  to  lower  groups),  delta  (observers  and  hunters), and  omega  (protectors)  [53].  The  GWO 
algorithm is based on the mass hunting of wolves, which will be examined in detail below. 
For the design of GWO, the most important factors include best position (α), second solution (β), third 
solution (δ), and other solutions (ω). For example, the mathematical equation for the siege of prey by 
gray wolves is defined as follows [53]: 

𝑋(𝑡 + 1) = 𝑋𝑝(𝑡) − 𝐴 ∗ 𝐷(𝑡) 

𝐷(𝑡) = |𝐶 ∗ 𝑋𝑝(𝑡) − 𝑋(𝑡)|,

𝑡 = 1,2, … , 𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 

𝐴 = 𝑎(2𝑟1 − 1),

𝐶 = 2𝑟2,

𝑟1&𝑟2 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚 𝑣𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟  ∈ [−1,1] 

In  the  above  relations,  𝑋(𝑡)  represents  the  position  of  the  gray  wolf  in  the  i-th  repeat,  and  𝑋𝑝(𝑡) 
represents the hunting position in the t repeat. Also, component α is reduced linearly from 2 to zero 
[53]. 

In the search space, we do not know 𝑋𝑝(𝑡), so we consider the hunting position α. Therefore, hunting 
equations are presented as follows [53]: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
𝑋1(𝑡) = 𝑋𝛼(𝑡) − 𝐴1 ∗ 𝐷𝛼(𝑡),

𝑋2(𝑡) = 𝑋𝛽(𝑡) − 𝐴2 ∗ 𝐷𝛽(𝑡),

𝐷𝛼(𝑡) = |𝐶1 ∗ 𝑋𝛼(𝑡) − 𝑋(𝑡)| 
𝐷𝛽(𝑡) = |𝐶2 ∗ 𝑋𝛽(𝑡) − 𝑋(𝑡)| 

𝑋3(𝑡) = 𝑋𝛿(𝑡) − 𝐴3 ∗ 𝐷𝛿(𝑡),

𝐷𝛿(𝑡) = |𝐶3 ∗ 𝑋𝛿(𝑡) − 𝑋(𝑡)| 

𝑋(𝑡 + 1) =

(𝑋1(𝑡) + 𝑋2(𝑡) + 𝑋3(𝑡))

Figure (13) shows the steps of the GWO algorithm. More details of the GWO method are provided in 
[53].

2.5. Statistical Metrics   
This section introduces the statistical parameters for evaluating the proposed method of SZ detection 
from the rs-fMRI modality. In this research, the K-Fold cross-validation with k = 5 is used. Evaluation 
parameters include accuracy (Acc), sensitivity (Sens), specificity (Spec), precision (Prec), and F1-Score 
(FS). The equations of evaluation parameters are shown below [65-66].

3. Experiment Results  
This section reports the results of  the proposed SZ  and  ADHD  detection method from  the  rs-fMRI 
modality. To implement the proposed method, a PC with NVidia 1070 GPU, 16 GB RAM, and Core i7 
CPU  is  used.  The  rs-fMRI  preprocessing  steps  are  performed  by  the  FSL  toolbox.  Also,  all  the 
simulations were done by Sckit-learn [67] and TensorFlow 2 toolboxes [68] in Python 3.7 environment. 
As mentioned in the previous sections, all simulations are performed on the UCLA dataset [44], which 
contains rs-fMRI data from HC, BD, ADHD, and SZ subjects. This study used three classes, including 
HC, SZ, and ADHD, for experiments. Then, preprocessing was performed on rs-fMRI data, and Pearson 
correlation  coefficients  (PCC)  are  calculated  to  estimate  the  connectivity  between  ROIs.  In  the 
following, the correlation matrix with 118 × 118 sizes were extracted from rs-fMRI data.  
After the preprocessing step, correlation matrix images with 118 × 118 sizes are fed to the input of the 
proposed CNN-AE model.  In this step, the feature extraction from the correlation matrices is based on 
the proposed CNN-AE architecture. Following that, the results of the proposed CNN-AE model along 
with DT [57], MLP [46], KNN [47], SVM [48], and RF [49] classifier algorithms for SZ and ADHD 
detection are presented. The  authors introduced the proposed CNN-AE  method,which is the paper's 
primary  novelty.  In  section  2-3,  the  details  for  the  proposed  CNN-AE  model  is  provided.  The 
experiment results of the proposed CNN-AE model with ML classifier techniques are shown in Table 
(2). According to Table (2), the KNN algorithm has achieved better results than other ML classifier 
techniques.  The  confusion  matrix  for  the  KNN  model  is  shown  in  Figure  (14).  Also,  Figure  (15) 
displayed the results of statistical metrics for all ML classifiers.

In the following, the experiment results of the proposed CNN-AE model with ANFIS classifier methods 
are presented. The ANFIS is one of the most important type-1 fuzzy systems [69]. This method is based 
on a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) system [50] and has achieved successful results in various medical 
research [70-71]. There are several training methods for ANFIS, and in this paper, the hybrid technique 
is used. Also, in another part of the simulations, the GA [51], PSO [52], and GWO [53] optimization 
algorithms were used for the training of the ANFIS model.  
In  different studies, the  researchers have  used  optimization techniques in  ANFIS  training, and  they 
achieved promising results [72-74]. To implement the ANFIS model, the FCM method is first used, 
which is based on  Gaussian MFs  [50]. Since it is a  classification problem,  three Gaussian MFs are 
provided for each input data. Figure (16) shows several Gaussian MFs for SZ and ADHD detection. 
Then, the hybrid method and optimization techniques expressed to train the ANFIS model were tested 
and compared. In Table (3), the hyper-parameters of GA [51], PSO [52], and GWO [53] algorithms are 
presented for  ANFIS  training. Finally, the results of  the  CNN-AE  model  with  ANFIS,  ANFIS-GA, 
ANFIS-PSO, and ANFIS-GWO classifier algorithms are shown in Table (4).

The experiment results in Table (4) show the superiority of the ANFIS-GWO method compared to the 
other ANFIS algorithms. The reason for the high accuracy of ANFIS-GWO compared to other ANFIS 
models  is  the  use  of  the  GWO  method  in  the  training  step.  Researchers  have  not  used  the  GWO 
algorithm  to  train  fuzzy  systems  such  as  ANFIS  [50],  which  is  another  novelty  of  this  paper.  The 
confusion matrix for the ANFIS-GWO technique is displayed in Figure (17). Also, Figure (18) displays 
the results of statistical metrics for the ANFIS classifier.

In the following, we present the results of the proposed CNN-AE model alongside IT2FR classifiers. 
The authors have proposed the IT2FR model for the first time, and it is considered the most important 
novelty of this paper. Similar to ANFIS, the proposed IT2FR technique is optimized by GA [51], PSO 
[52], and GWO [53] methods. To implement of IT2FR model, three interval type-2 Gaussian MFs are 
provided  for  each  input  data.  Figure  (19)  shows  several  intervals  type-2  Gaussian  MFs  for  SZ  and 
ADHD  detection.  Table  (5)  reports  the  results  obtained  from  IT2FR,  IT2FR-GA,  IT2FR-PSO,  and 
IT2FR-GWO methods. According to Table (5), it is clear that the IT2FR-GWO method has achieved 
the most accuracy. The confusion matrix for the IT2FR-GWO method is shown in Figure (20). Also, 
Figure (21) displayed the results of statistical metrics for IT2RF classifiers.

In this section, the results of the proposed method for the diagnosis of SZ and ADHD disorders were 
discussed. The proposed method of this research has three important novelties, including introducing 
the CNN-AE model with proposed layers, the IT2FR method, and the use of the GWO optimization 
method to train the proposed IT2FR technique. In Tables (2), (4), and (5), the accuracy of different 
classification algorithms based are shown and compared. It can be seen that the IT2FR-GWO method 
has been able to achieve state-of-the-art results in comparison with other classification methods.

4. Limitations of Study 
This section is dedicated to the limitations of this study. The UCLA dataset has limited rs-fMRI data to 
diagnose various brain disorders, including SZ and ADHD. This challenge has made it still impossible 
to provide advanced DL models for the diagnosis of SZ and ADHD. Also, this dataset contains rs-fMRI 
data and does not have T-fMRI modalities from subjects with mental disorders. The UCLA dataset is 
used to diagnose SZ, BD, and ADHD disorders, while diagnosing brain disorders of varying severity is 
very  important.  The  proposed  method  of  this  paper  consists  of  DL,  fuzzy  logic,  and  optimization 

 
 
 
algorithms.  Implementing  the  proposed  method  is  very  complicated  because  the  CNN-AE  model, 
IT2FR, and GWO methods have different adjustment parameters. Also, the proposed method has a long 
execution time, which is another limitation.   

5. Discussion, Conclusion, and Future works  
Brain disorders such as SZ and ADHD are among the most important brain diseases that pose a serious 
threat to the health of many people around the world [7][43]. Brain disorders negatively affect brain 
function. So, various diagnostic methods have been introduced by specialist physicians to treat them 
[25].  Currently,  the  most  used  methods  for  the  diagnosis  of  SZ  and  ADHD  disorders  include 
psychological  tests  and  neuroimaging  techniques  [7]  [43].  fMRI  modalities  are  one  of  the  best 
functional  neuroimaging  modalities,  and  physicians  and  doctors  can  use  them  to  diagnose  brain 
disorders.  [25].  Diagnosis  of  SZ  and  ADHD  disorders  from  fMRI  modalities  is  challenging.  To 
overcome the challenges, there has been significant growth over the years in research into the diagnosis 
of various brain disorders including SZ [6-7], ADHD [43], etc. using AI (ML and DL) techniques. 
|In this paper, we presented a new computer-aided diagnosis system (CADS) based on the proposed 
CNN-AE  architecture  and IT2FR-GWO  classifier  for diagnosing SZ  and  ADHD  disorders from rs-
fMRI data. The steps of the proposed method comprise the dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction, 
and  classification. First, the  UCLA  dataset [44]  is  used  for  experiments. As  mentioned earlier, this 
dataset has rs-fMRI modality from HC, SZ, ADHD, and BD patients. We used the HC, SZ, and ADHD 
data for our experiments. In the second step, the rs-fMRI modality is preprocessed using FSL toolbox 
[45]. Then, we extracted the correlation coefficients matrices with 118 × 118 size as 2D images from 
rs-fMRI data of each subject for post-processing.    
The  third  step  is  dedicated  to  feature  extraction,  which  is  performed  by  a  proposed  2D  CNN-AE 
architecture. In this step, the 2D images are fed to the input of the proposed CNN-AE model. The first 
novelty of this paper is an improved CNN-AE architecture. According to Figure (9) and Table (1), the 
proposed CNN-AE architecture has 7 CNN layers. 
The last step of the proposed method is classification. A few ML-based, fuzzy type-1, and fuzzy type-
2 methods are used for the classification of CNN-AE  features. The DT [57], MLP [46], KNN [47], 
SVM [48], and RF [49] are ML classifier methods. Also, Type-1 fuzzy classification techniques include 
ANFIS [50], ANFIS-GA, ANFIS-POS, and ANFIS-GWO. The IT2FR, IT2FR-GA, IT2FR-PSO, and 
IT2FR-GWO  are  type-2  fuzzy  classifier  techniques.  In  this  work,  the  IT2FR  method  was  first 
introduced by the authors and is considered the most important novelty of the paper. In addition, another 
novelty of this paper is combining the IT2FR and GWO methods for classification. It should be noted 
that in the classification section, the K-Fold cross-validation with k = 5 is also used. The experiment 
results of the proposed method show that the use of the CNN-E model and the IT2FR-GWO method 
has led to increased accuracy in diagnosing SZ and ADHD disorders. 
In Table (6), the proposed method results are compared with related works in the diagnosis of SZ and 
ADHD using fMRI modalities. According to Table (6), the researchers used different MRI datasets for 
SZ and ADHD detection. In related works, researchers have identified SZ from HC. However, our paper 
uses the UCLA dataset; the classes presented to the classifier in this paper includes HC, SZ, and ADHD. 
Table (6) shows that this paper's proposed method has higher accuracy than other related works. 
The proposed method of this paper can help physicians accurately diagnose SZ and ADHD from rs-
MRI data. Also, the proposed method can be used in the future as application software for diagnosing 
SZ or ADHD in hospitals or specialized medical centers. Furthermore, in future works, new DL models 
such as transformers [100-101], attention mechanism [102-103], graph theory [104-105], etc., can be 
used for the diagnosis of SZ and ADHD.
