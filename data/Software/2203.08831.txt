We explicitly demonstrate that current numerical relativity techniques are able to accurately
evolve black hole binaries with mass ratios of the order of 1000:1. This proof of principle has direct
implications for future third generation (3G) gravitational wave detectors and space mission LISA, as
by purely numerical methods we will be able to accurately compute gravitational waves from mergers,
as directly predicted by general relativity. We perform a sequence of simulations in the intermediate

small hole starting from rest at a proper distance D ≈ 13M . We compare these headon full numerical
evolutions with the corresponding semianalytic perturbative results ﬁnding an impressive agreement
for the total gravitational radiated energy and linear momentum as well as for the waveform spectra.
We display numerical convergence of the results and identify the minimal numerical resolutions
required to accurately solve for these very low amplitude gravitational waves. We conclude that we
have the basic numerical techniques able to build up basic template banks in time for 3G detectors

INTRODUCTION

Ref. [18] for a current status review).

There is currently great interest in the binary black
hole small mass ratio regime. On one hand, the di-
rect detection of gravitational waves from binary black
holes since GW150914[1] and the currently 90 new
detections[2] by LIGO-Virgo conﬁrmed the detailed pre-
dictions of Numerical Relativity[3, 4]. On the other hand,
the steady progress towards the establishment of LISA
launch and operation in the next decade [5] and the devel-
opment of third generation (3G) ground detectors [6–8]
highlight the necessity to expand the theoretical stud-
ies to much smaller mass ratios than are currently in
use, most of them valid in the comparable mass-ratio-
regime[9]. Scenarios involving intermediate mass black
holes merging with supermassive black holes in the cen-
ter of galaxies are targets for LISA [10] and stellar mass
black holes merging with intermediate mass black hole
are targets of 3G detectors, also leading small mass ra-
tios mergers.

The theoretical interest in the small and extreme mass
ratio (particle limit) binaries precedes LIGO and LISA
conceptions. The pioneering work of Regge and Wheeler
[11] and Zerilli [12] laid down the formalism for ﬁrst or-
der perturbations around a single Schwarzschild black
hole, and later work by Teukolsky[13] considered the
more general Kerr black hole background. The consis-
tency of this approach at higher perturbative orders,
including not only radiation reaction but self-force on
the smaller hole (particle), was proven much later by
Mino, Sasaki, and Tanaka[14] and then by Quinn and
Wald[15]. This approach proved hard to implement ex-
plicitly, but steady progress has been made since the early
headon collisions[16, 17] to the current generic orbits (See

Numerical Relativity remains the primary method on
the forefront of computing gravitational waves and its
results can be used to ﬁt EOB, Phenom, Surrogate phe-
nomenological models [19–21]. One of the important
challenges for numerical relativity is the introduction of
any new physical scale to be resolved accurately and,
even if mesh reﬁnement methods are applied, this re-
mains in general computationally demanding. A ﬁrst
prototypical study of a 100:1 mass-ratio binary black hole
in [22] produced the last two orbits before merger. The
headon collision case was then numerically studied in [23]
(and its D-dimensional generalization in [24]).
In [25]
it was studied a binary black hole numerical simulation
with spins and a mass ratio 18:1 and in [26] a 15:1 mass
ratio case. A recent revisit to the small mass ratio prob-
lem [27] produced 13 orbits before merger for a 128:1
mass-ratio binary, leading then to the possibility of im-
proving eﬀective one body models in the small mass ra-
tio regime[28] and covering the 3G detectors mass-ratios
regime and LISA most conspicuous sources.

Still, LISA could be sensitive to even smaller mass ra-
tio binaries, two orders of magnitude smaller, deep into
the intermediate-mass-ratio-inspiral (IMRI) regime [10].
This raises the question if Numerical Relativity can still
provide accurate predictions for the waveforms, trajecto-
ries, and ﬁnal remnant of the merger of such small mass

current limits of the methods of Numerical Relativity, in
particular the moving punctures approach[3]. We will
test our formalism in the regime of up to 1000:1 mass-
ratio binaries. For this ﬁrst prototypical study we will
consider headon collisions from rest and compare them
to the particle limit results (without the need to include
self-force or radiation reaction computations). Our main

 
 
 
 
 
 
goal here is to establish if the moving punctures method
can resolve such extremely small levels of gravitational
radiation (even lower amplitudes than in the orbital case)
and if the results show convergence with increasing nu-
merical resolution towards the corresponding expected
(perturbative) values. This, in turn, can provide land-
marks to reproduce as tests or to use in ﬁts by semiana-
lytic/phenomenological models.

plays an important role in the accuracy of the results and
the optimal use of the grid points to resolve the binary
black hole dynamics and its gravitational radiation. In
particular, the use of the η(W ) driven by the function
of the evolved conformal factor W = e−2Φ in [27] was
seen to lead to numerical noise that can be avoided with
the spatial coordinate (cid:126)r dependent ηG((cid:126)r) choice, while
preserving the properties of adapting to the spacetime

In Ref.

[27] we have studied the late inspiral and
merger of small mass ratio binary black holes, reaching
a 128:1 case performing 13 orbits before merger. In or-
der to perform this simulation we have used the LazEv
code[29] with 8th order spatial ﬁnite diﬀerences [30], 4th
order Runge-Kutta time integration with a Courant fac-
tor (dt/dx = 1/4). Crucially, we used a grid structure de-
veloped for the q = 1/15 simulations in [31] and adapted
for the 128:1 with three additional reﬁnement levels (15
total) from the boundaries of the simulation down to the
horizon of the smaller hole.

We have performed several convergence and error stud-
ies of our numerical

Ref. [32], in Appendix B of Ref. [33], and in Ref. [34],
we performed convergence studies for diﬀerent mass ra-
tios and spins of the binaries. In in Ref. [4] and Ref. [35]
we compared the RIT waveforms with those produced
completely independently by the SXS collaboration ﬁnd-
ing excellent agreement, convergence towards each others
results and matching of individual modes up to l = 5. In
Refs. [27, 36] we studied convergence for an orbiting bi-
nary with q = 1/15 for 10 orbits prior to merger as well
as consistency between radiated and horizon quantities
for up to q = 1/128 orbiting black hole binaries, and val-
idation versus EOB models [28]. In [37] we have studied
the accuracy of our simulations versus the Courant fac-
tor and concluded that while we can use 1/2 for short
runs, we can ensure long term evolutions with 1/4, and
not much gain was obtained by further reducing it to
1/8. For LIGO-Virgo applications, we have found that
1/3 was good enough for most of the simulations [38–41].
In the present work we will include several important
variations. We design a sequence of small mass ratio
headon collisions from rest with decreasing mass ratios
by factors of 2 and correspondingly add a new reﬁnement
level of half grid size tight around the small hole, in the
Zeno’s approach of [27] and keeping the deepest reﬁne-
ment level just above the small hole horizon. A second
important diﬀerence here is in the use of the numerical
gauge. In Ref. [36] we have found that the η parameter

In order to test the accuracy of our simulations against
the results of ﬁrst order perturbation theory, and to study
its numerical convergence, we perform a ﬁrst prototyp-
ical study of the direct plunge of a small black hole
onto a large Schwarzschild black hole from rest at a
reference isotropic coordinate R0 = 10M , correspond-
ing to a proper distance from the large hole horizon of
D/M = (cid:82) 10
0.5(1+1/2x)2dx = 12.9707 (Here M is the total
ADM mass of the system).

This choice allows us to study the merger of the holes
using quadrant symmetry by placing the small black hole
along the z-axis and hence reduce the numerical grid to
one quarter of its full coverage. The grid structure of
our mesh reﬁnements have a size of the largest box for
all simulations of ±400M . The number of points be-
tween 0 and 400 on the coarsest grid is XXX in nXXX
(i.e. n100 has 100 points). So, the grid spacing on the
coarsest is 400/XXX. The resolution in the wavezone is
100M/XXX (i.e. n100 has M/1.00, n206 has M/2.06).
The grid around the larger black hole (m2) is ﬁxed at
±1.0M in size and is the 9th reﬁnement level. There-
fore the grid spacing is 400/XXX/28. The grid around
the small black hole (m1) starts at reﬁnement level 11
for q = 7 with size ±0.15625M and an additional grid
is added for each doubling of the mass ratio with half
the size, down to 18 reﬁnement levels for q1024 with
size = ±0.00125M . The minimal grid spacing is then
400/XXX/2(#reﬁnement levels−1). For q1024 with resolu-
tion of n206, we would have 400/206/217 = 0.000014814
or a resolution of M/67502.

We are thus able to perform convergence studies at
higher global resolutions than usual with reasonable
amounts of computational resources and running times
(for instance, for our resolution, n172, the q1024 using
18 grid reﬁnement levels simulation took 83 days on 10
dual Intel Xeon 6242 16-core CPUs at 2.8GHz nodes, us-
ing a total of 19920 node-hours or 637440 core-hours in
our white lagoon CCRG cluster).

The extraction of gravitational radiation from the nu-
merical relativity simulations is performed using the for-
mulas (22) and (23) from [45] for the energy and lin-
ear momentum radiated, respectively, in terms of the ex-
tracted Weyl scalar Ψ4 at the observer location Robs =
113M . While in the case of the particle limit, we evolve
the Zerilli equation and the waveform variable ψ(cid:96)m in the
time domain as in [46] and extract the energy and linear
momentum as given in formulas (2) and (4) of Ref. [47].
To make a direct comparison of the numerical and per-
turbative results we have not removed the initial spurious
radiation from either of the waveforms nor extrapolated
them to inﬁnite observer location.

SIMULATIONS’ RESULTS

An important goal of this study is to assess the accu-
racy of our numerical methods in the so far unexplored
regime of a thousand to one mass ratio black hole bina-
ries. In order to evaluate these estimates we ﬁrst perform
an internal error analysis by studying the numerical con-
vergence of gravitational radiation with resolution. In-
dependently, the second goal is to perform an external
comparison of those radiative quantities with the results
of ﬁrst order perturbations theory. Once we establish the
accuracy of our results we can reliably start discussing
potential correlations between the mode and mass ratio
dependences of the non-linear (numerical relativity) ap-

proach to the linear (perturbative) regime, like our ﬁrst
estimate qlinear ∼ 1/(8(cid:96)2) below.

A technical innovation we are going to use here with
respect to the previous simulations [36] is the use of a
smoother gauge as given by Eq. (2) that removes the ini-
tial numerical noise. This is going to play a crucial role
here, given the much lower gravitational wave amplitude
levels emitted by the small mass ratio binaries studied in
this paper. In particular, Eq. (2) retains the adaptivity
of the gauge to the diﬀerent size of the black holes on
the grid, but more interestingly the asymptotic behav-
ior of ηG → 1 seems to much improve the extraction of
gravitational radiation.

radius Robs = 113M . We ﬁrst note the good agreement
of the computed (rescaled) radiated energy with the cor-
responding particle limit as we approach smaller mass ra-
tios for all the (cid:96)-modes displayed here. We then note that
the approach to the particle limits may depend on the
value of (cid:96), roughly in a sequence q ∼ 1/32, 1/64, 1/128,
and 1/256 for (cid:96) = 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively. A critical value
of the mass ratio, below which the particle limit seems
to be a very good approximation (within 1%) to the full
numerical simulation seems to follow qlinear ∼ 1/(8(cid:96)2) to
reach the linear regime.

Table II displays our convergence study for the total
radiated energy (summed over (cid:96) = 2 through (cid:96) = 5)
in the form of gravitational waves. We use all available
runs (except those in parenthesis) at successive increas-
ing global resolutions h (by factors of ≈ 1.2) from those
labeled n084 to n206 and then use those values to ﬁt

show a high convergence rate, as expected for the 8th

From this expression we see that in order to be within
10% the particle limit we should be about q < 1/32.

A detail of the convergence versus spatial resolution
dx/M of the simulation is displayed in Fig. 2 as the ap-
proach of the radiated energy to its extrapolated to inﬁ-
nite resolution given in Table II.

In a similar fashion we can study the radiation of linear
momentum (in the headon collision there is no angular
momentum to be radiated). In this case the coupling of
modes (cid:96) and (cid:96) + 1 in equation (4) of Ref. [47] makes the
computations more sensitive and we take the opportu-
nity to display in Fig. 3 the dependence of the results
on resolution (in terms of a recoil velocity normalized by
(1 + q)2/q2 V and in km/s). This allows us to, for in-
stance, assess the minimal resolution required to reliably
compute linear momentum radiated. This computation
of the recoil velocity thus provides us with a practical
assessment of the minimal global resolution requirement
in future computations at very small binary mass ratios.
We will discuss this point further in the next section.

Our results are consistent with those of [23] for the
100:1 mass ratio and extrapolated to inﬁnite observer
location. Since, we extract waveforms at Robs = 113M
and release the smaller hole from a ﬁnite distance R0 =
10M we expect lower values for Erad and Vr.

A ﬁrst display of the agreement between the highest
available resolution runs and the particle limit is dis-
played in Fig. 4. Those waveforms are rescaled by the

leading dependence with the mass ratio, (1 + q)/q, but
otherwise not ﬁtted or adjusted. The excellent super-
position of waveforms shows both, the approach to the
particle limit above q128, and the high accuracy of the
simulations (note that the rescaling for q1024 implies a
factor of nearly one thousand of ampliﬁcation).

Another detailed feature of the gravitational waves is
given by the spectrum of radiation (for each individual
mode, in this case the leading ((cid:96) = 2, m = 0), in units
of m2
1) as shown in Fig. 5. This gives us the opportunity
to study the approach to the linear perturbative regime.
We see that for q7, q16, the spectra lies below that of the
particle limit (normalized by (1 + q)2/q2/M 2 dE(cid:96)m/dω)
and only at lower values of q the spectra of the simula-
tions approach that of the particle limit [43].

Note that the rescaling of E(cid:96) and Vrecoil by ∼ q−2 im-
plies a precision of one in one million for the q1024 case,
and errors within 10% from the particle limit ensures an
accuracy of the runs of 10−7.

CONCLUSIONS

Our proof of principle in this paper shows that Nu-
merical Relativity and the moving puncture formalism
can eﬀectively be used to compute small mass ratio bi-
naries (even 1000:1, a so far unexplored regime, and well
into the IMRI territory [10]) and can accurately describe
those very low amplitude gravitational waveforms. While

waveforms. Extrapolation to inﬁnite resolution and order of convergence is derived.

and the “conservative” portion of the gravitational ﬁeld
in the nonlinear regime, the radiative ﬁelds, that are gen-
erated at inter-black holes scales and are extracted in the
asymptotic region at the observer location, scale down
with the mass ratio q and eventually reach such low am-
plitude values that a higher global reﬁnement of the grids
is required to properly resolve them. We have thus ex-
plored the approach to the convergence regime and have
seen that using the radiated energy as a reference, the
simulations with resolution n084 are suﬃcient to approx-

imate results for the up to q16 while the q64 requires at
least n100, q256 requires at least n120, and so on until
we reached q1024, requiring at least n144. This gives
a rule-of-thumb for the minimal resolution hmin from a
base resolution h0 = 0.84 to solve accurately a mass ra-
tio binary as small as q ≈ 1

the results with n172 resolution runs (globally doubling
that of n084) as shown in Table II. At further higher
resolutions one may then consider dropping one of the
innermost reﬁnement levels to make simulations more ef-
ﬁcient.

We have found that the gauge ηG in (2) notably im-
proves the numerical noise from our previous η(W ) used
in [22]. Notably we also found that the η = 1 gauge
works similarly well, suggesting that the lower asymp-
totic values of η allow for a smooth and accurate trans-
port of radiation from the sources to the extraction re-
gions [36, 49], and that the beneﬁts of an adapted gauge
around the horizons is somewhat taken care of by the

additional reﬁnement levels required to resolve the small
hole. The choice of gauge and the appropriate minimal
global resolutions that warrant the convergence regime
providing valuable quantitative results for the radiation,
orbital trajectories, and remnant of the very small mass
ratio binary black hole mergers, will help us establishing
initial parameters for further orbital evolutions studies.

modes and accuracy, in the orbital case. Mode decompo-
sition is often used in the phenomenological modeling of
gravitational waves and in self-force calculations which
include much higher (cid:96)-modes [18]. Higher (cid:96)-modes not
only are smaller in amplitude but of higher frequency
content, leading not only to resolution issues but also to
resilience of nonlinearities (involving derivatives of the
ﬁelds), as we can infer from our study.

Finally, we note that with larger computational re-
sources the current numerical relativity codes can do
both, increase the resolution of the current simulations,
since codes display a good constant load (weak) scaling,
and perform explorations of the binary’s parameter space
that include the spin of the large hole at essentially no
extra cost from the base case that used O(10) computer
nodes per run. Much longer numerical evolutions in time,
on the other hand, would beneﬁt of any future software
and hardware speedups by LISA launch.
