ABSTRACT

Ongoing research on anomaly detection for the Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly expanding ﬁeld.
This growth necessitates an examination of application trends and current gaps. The vast majority of
those publications are in areas such as network and infrastructure security, sensor monitoring, smart
home, and smart city applications and are extending into even more sectors. Recent advancements
in the ﬁeld have increased the necessity to study the many IoT anomaly detection applications.
This paper begins with a summary of the detection methods and applications, accompanied by a
discussion of the categorization of IoT anomaly detection algorithms. We then discuss the current
publications to identify distinct application domains, examining papers chosen based on our search
criteria. The survey considers 64 papers among recent publications published between January
2019 and July 2021.
In recent publications, we observed a shortage of IoT anomaly detection
methodologies, for example, when dealing with the integration of systems with various sensors,
data and concept drifts, and data augmentation where there is a shortage of Ground Truth data.
Finally, we discuss the present such challenges and offer new perspectives where further research is
required.

Introduction

The Internet of Things (IoT) enables sensors2 and smart objects to communicate without the direct involvement
of human agents, necessitating near real-time processing [1]. Any data analytics performed via IoT requires the
development of novel methodologies to work within the limited computational budget. One type of data analysis that
looks for unusual states within the system is anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection or event detection.
The anomaly detection algorithms are checkpoints for the incoming trafﬁc at various stages, ranging from the IoT
network level to the data center. In the latter case, there is a high demand for reliable detection for data cleaning [2]
and classiﬁcation purposes [3].

The signiﬁcance of anomaly detection is that anomalies in IoT data, which occur sparsely, can yield crucial actionable
information in various sectors, including medicine, manufacturing, ﬁnance, trafﬁc management, and energy. Anomaly

detection in IoT, for example, is employed in the betting and gambling sector to detect insider trading by analyzing
trade activity patterns [4]. On the other hand, industrial machines use a detection algorithm to ensure production safety
[5].

Currently, most anomaly detection methods in the IoT involve signiﬁcant human engagement and optimizations for
local solutions. In theory, an anomaly is simple to comprehend, and a domain expert will spot anomalous data if
given enough time. However, there are several difﬁculties in developing an automated model in an IoT environment.
It is challenging and not always possible to deﬁne and categorize all types of anomalous data correctly, especially
when labeled training data are only partially available/not available. In many ﬁelds, the notion of normal behavior is
constantly changing and evolving. One such example is a change in household occupancy, which results in a change in
electricity demand [6]. Furthermore, data often contain noise, and when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, the magnitude
of noise resembles true anomalies. The complexity increases as the number of interconnected systems grows and the
variety of input data types.

IoT anomaly detection has a wide range of applications outlined in this paper, some of which are more developed
than others (such as network security), and others that have the potential for growth. The literature on the subject
of anomaly detection in the IoT is extensive and diverse. However, the discipline is still in its early stages, and the
number of articles published on this topic is expanding. Such frequent changes require updated literature. This survey
adds to the earlier research and provides a current picture of recent developments and different domains of the IoT
anomaly detection application. Additionally, this paper expands on the categorization of anomaly detection algorithms
and conducts an extensive keyword trend analysis to demonstrate the year-over-year literature concentration.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a discussion on the background of anomaly detection
algorithm in IoT and related work. The subsequent sections 3 and 4 present the search strategy for this paper and look
at recent developments not described in previous reviews to the best of our knowledge. The ﬁnal section 5 includes
new perspectives and concluding remarks.

2 Background and related work

2.1 Deﬁnition and categorization of IoT anomaly detection

An anomaly is a data point that is not associated with the predicted behavior in a modeled system3 Anomalies are rare
events or observations that deviate signiﬁcantly from conventional behavior or patterns observed in a single data point,
a speciﬁc context or slice of time (for example, a season or quarter), or the entire dataset. In principle, anomalies
result from external factors, such as sensor failure or external attack, and the purpose of a detection algorithm is
to identify where an anomaly has occurred and classify/infer the cause. In the binary classiﬁcation of an anomaly,
the approximation model that best ﬁts the expected data behavior is crucial. Furthermore, the complexities of many
situations require a distinct detection strategy for each application [7]. Example anomalies are shown in Figure 1.

3Anomalies in a simple, intuitive explanation are: Given a set of Lego (Lego is a trademark of The Lego Group) pieces, where the
building instructions are withheld/unknown from the start, the task of a machine learning model is to generate a set of instructions
and construct an object or a character. The remaining pieces that do not ﬁt the trained model are anomalies.

An IoT anomaly detection method is classiﬁed into four categories by combining the classiﬁcations from previously
published articles such as Fahim and Sillitti [8], and Cook et al. [9]. They are categorized based on how they approach
the problem, how they are applied, the type of method, and the latency of the algorithm. An illustrative overview of
the four categories is displayed in ﬁgure 2. This section brieﬂy describes the categorization of anomalies and some of
the conventional approaches used in IoT.

Figure 2: An info-graphic overview of the categorization of anomalies.

i By Method: The approaches are geometrical, statistical, or machine learning. Geometrical methods are based
on the assumption that when distance- and density-based strategies represent a given dataset, the expected and
anomalous data are separated. In a set of data points, the idea behind isolation or density-based techniques is that
anomalies appear in sparse regions. These methods use either a static or a dynamic threshold ‘t’ on the estimated
distance ‘d’ to classify anomalies, which is given as:

(cid:40)

d =

< t

> t

, Normal (under threshold)
, Anomaly (above threshold)

(1)

Statistical methods such as the minimal volume in [10] try to model normal data using mathematical models and
distributions. The minimal volume approach aims to create an n-dimensional simplex around the given data cloud
(ground truth), where the objective function is to minimize the volume occupied while maximizing the ground

truth data points. An anomaly is deﬁned as any data that do not ﬁt the simplex. Another is a forecasting approach
called exponential smoothing [11]. This technique anticipates the future data point using prior data points and a
smoothing parameter. Anomalous data obtained from statistical methods are those that deviate from the established
model. Conventional geometrical and statistical methods are backed by a substantial body of research and rely on
a thorough understanding of the ground truth. These strategies do not reward many real-world instances in which
data models are very time-dependent. Therefore, data-driven machine learning and deep learning solutions are
required, which allow for more ﬂexible modiﬁcations.
The third subcategory is machine learning and deep learning models, which have increased in publication
frequency in recent years. The nature of the data supplied determines the selection of the model [12]. For
example, long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer models prefer sequential data inputs such as audio,
video, and time series [13]. On the other hand, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and autoencoder (AE)
prefer non-sequential data types, such as image input [14]. The algorithms attempt to distinguish between normal
and anomalous behavior by establishing a decision boundary, such as with the support vector machine (SVM)
classiﬁer [15] or future forecasting values in streaming data [16] with LSTM networks [17]. Depending on the
availability of training labels, these approaches are supervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, or completely
unsupervised [18].

ii By Application: The three routes of anomaly categorization by an application are constructive, destructive, and
data cleaning. Constructive applications are productive or beneﬁcial in nature and provide value to the world,
such as monitoring the elderly’s daily behavior for fall prevention in [19] using image descriptors and comparing
the performance between multilayer perceptron (MLP), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and SVM classiﬁers. Other
examples include Lu et al.’s work [20] using reinforcement learning for various unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
applications, including smart farming, and Nguyen et al. [21] using a federated learning approach for smart home
applications. Destructive applications are intended to disrupt daily operations to accomplish questionable ﬁnancial
gain, an intention to harm the network and application data ﬂowing through the IoT network, or disrupt critical
business practices. These applications negatively impact society; for example, the paper by Alsheikh et al. [22]
surveys different IoT cyberattacks and the latest developments in IoT security. Such applications require research
into solutions, such as RAPPER [23] and NBaIoT [24] using an AE, for prevention or steps taken before the illicit
incident and detection or actions taken after the incident. Finally, data cleaning or data cleansing applications,
such as DeepAnT [25] using deep CNN, remove unwanted data spikes and sensor noise from the input signal.

iii By Anomaly Type: One of the most frequently encountered types is the circumstance-speciﬁc type, which is the
point, contextual, and collective. An anomaly is a point anomaly if a single data point deviates from the expected
behavior. An example is the detection of credit card fraud [26]. A contextual anomaly is an instance that could be
considered anomalous in some speciﬁc context. This means that comparing multiple perspectives on the same data
point does not always result in anomalous behavior. A contextual anomaly is detected when both contextual and
behavioral characteristics are considered together. For example, in the case of trafﬁc offences, the anomalies vary
depending on the geolocation information [27]. Unlike a point or contextual anomaly, the ﬁnal type of anomaly,
collective anomaly, looks at the entire dataset. An example of a collective anomaly is the use of electrocardiograms
to monitor and detect anomalies or problems in the human heart [28].

iv By Latency: The latency and scalability of a detection algorithm determine whether the method is executed on
the ﬂy during the data collection stage or in a later stage of storage. An online algorithm can serially process
information, with a single data-point or a window, without having access to the complete input. Conventional
online geometrical and statistical approaches include the previously mentioned distance-based, density- and
deviation-based, and angle-based techniques. Examples of online methods include the IoT-Keeper by Hafeez et
al. [29], which uses fuzzy C-means, and Hedde et al. [30] with an ensemble approach. On the other hand, ofﬂine
algorithms have access to complete data. They involve relatively computationally expensive and sophisticated
algorithms to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time. However, it is essential to note that in recent
years, algorithms such as the paper by Wu et al. [31], which uses LSTM and Gaussian Naive Bayes, and other
models mentioned above, complete the model training process ofﬂine and deploy the model online.

2.2 Related work and our contribution

A variety of articles on anomaly detection in IoT are published, ranging from expert insight on time-series methods by
Cook et al. [32], an introductory summary of the detection methods released between 2000 and 2018 by Fahim and
Sillitti [33], an examination of sensor faults and outliers by Gaddam et al. [34], and a comprehensive investigation
of the work done in the early twenty-ﬁrst century by Chandola et al. [35]. The most prevalent forms of surveys are
data-speciﬁc, application-speciﬁc, or method-speciﬁc publications. For example, two recent surveys, a paper by Braei
and Wagner [36] and another by Mozaffari and Yilmaz [37], examined the use of univariate and multivariate data,
respectively. Other examples include the survey by Santos et al. [38] that examines smart city applications on 5G

wide area networks, a review paper on IoT security applications by Ahmad and Alsmadi [39], and anomaly detection
using deep learning approaches in a survey by Chalapathy and Chawla [40]. Yassine et al. [41] provide a detailed
examination of the methodologies, situations, and computing platforms used in the energy industry.

Despite the fact that this is not a systematic review paper, we did follow many of the techniques, but with some
variations. For example, instead of using customized text searches, we developed a bubble chart to visually identify
key research areas. Furthermore, based on our search, we found that the developments from 2019 and beyond are
insufﬁcient in other review papers. For this reason, our search criteria include papers published between January 2019
and July 2021. Our aim is to discover various IoT anomaly detection applications and report on recent ﬁndings. This
paper complements the previous literature by:

i examining publication trends, recent methods, and unique applications in IoT anomaly detection, and
ii identifying present-day issues and challenges.

3 Search strategy

3.1 Extraction of keyword trends

In this review, we include only papers published from January 2019 to July 2021. However, to better understand
the trends in IoT anomaly detection research, we will extract search keywords from the titles of previous decade
publications. We searched Google Scholar using the Publish or Perish tool from [42]. The search criteria were for
all article titles in this domain with keywords ‘iot’ and ‘anomaly’ published between 2011 and 2020 and excluded
duplicate titles. After merging the titles into a string, we extracted the unique keywords and their frequency of
occurrence. Subsequently, generic terms such as ‘an’, ‘the’, and ‘novel’ were eliminated from the text. We then sorted
the remaining keywords into two categories: (a) methodologies and platforms and (b) applications. Figure 3 shows a
bubble chart of publication keywords. Keywords with larger bubbles denote a higher frequency of publications, and
smaller bubbles indicate a potential for an increase in contributions. From the ﬁgure, we discovered that the methods
and platform keywords, which include ‘machine learning’, ‘deep learning’, ‘distributed’, ‘edge’, ‘framework’,
‘industrial IoT’, ‘intelligent’, ‘network’, and ‘system’ all become increasingly relevant for the community. From the
applications side, they are ‘architecture’, ‘attacks’, ‘cyber’, ‘intrusion detection’, ‘monitoring’, ‘security’, ‘sensor’,
‘smart devices’, and ‘wireless’.

3.2 Papers’ selection criteria

Following the extraction of the keyword trends, we performed a thorough search across established journals and
conferences, in the order of the most recently published articles, using the search keywords ‘iot’, ‘anomaly detection’,
and each of the trending keywords. There were searches in IEEE Xplore, Elsevier ScienceDirect, MDPI, Google
Scholar, and arXiv. A total of 2242 articles were collected, which were published between January 2019 and July
2021. Duplicate papers and review publications were then removed using the exclusion keywords ‘survey’, ‘literature
review’, ‘case study’, ‘reviews’, ‘systematic review’, and ‘this review’. The titles of the remaining 1670 manuscripts
were rapidly assessed, beginning with the relevance recommendations provided by the search engines mentioned and
excluded patents and citation results. At this stage, there were 986 unique articles for further evaluation. Graphing the
publishers of the remaining papers in a pie chart in ﬁgure 4 reveals that IEEE, Elsevier, Springer, and MDPI account
for 76.1 percent of all recent publications.

Figure 4: A pie chart illustrating the frequency of articles produced by publisher type between January 2019 and July
2021.

The remaining articles were then ﬁltered with the inclusion keywords ‘experiments’, ‘evaluation,’ and ‘results.’ This
allowed us to identify publications that had included experimental results as part of their work. Finally, the abstracts,
discussions, and conclusions of the remaining 194 manuscripts were examined to identify papers relevant to the scope
of this review. When determining the relevance of the content, the factors taken into consideration are as follows:

1. This article made a notable contribution to the ﬁeld of IoT anomaly detection. Although the search criteria
speciﬁed inclusion and exclusion keywords, publications that were not directly related to this paper’s context
were excluded.

2. The publication targeted a unique application domain. Multiple articles in the same application domain, such
as botnet attack detection, were narrowed down to the best of our ability, selecting the most recent and higher
Google Scholar search rank.

Following the ﬁltering process, we discuss the selected 64 articles published in the previous three years.

4 Recent advancements

This section covers the different applications of IoT anomaly detection from the selected papers. Application data and
network data are the two main types of data. The data can be streamed in the case of time-series or processed from
tabular data. Application data refers to data from IoT sensors processed to serve practical and business applications.
Additionally, network telemetry data, such as CPU and memory usage, are monitored for the health of the IoT network.

We found applications that are for individual or residential use and industrial applications. There are health monitoring
applications for individuals that use data from wearable devices and smart home applications for residential use-cases.
A few examples of industrial applications include monitoring the health of manufacturing equipment, ensuring the
quality of data transferred through sensors, and smart city applications such as trafﬁc monitoring. All of these
applications require data security, user privacy, and reliability of data transfer. Figure 5 shows the two types of data
and their respective applications.

Figure 5: The two types of data (network and application data) and their applications.

On the basis of these data, we combined the different applications into sixteen categories. The categories and the
papers are as follows.

4.1

IoT anomaly detection applications with time-series data

The ﬁrst category is concerned with general time-series or streaming data, which are used in a range of applications.
Hierarchical clustering, a non-parametric and lightweight approach, identiﬁes linked sensors and generates clusters. It
is possible to utilize a single detection method for all sensors in a cluster. For anomaly detection, the article by Shukla et
al. [43] used robust statistical M-estimators paired with the LSTM neural network. Temperature data collected by local
weather stations frequently contain missing values and inaccurate readings. The paper by Sobhani et al. [44] shows
a substantial relationship between temperature and load. The accuracy of ﬁnal load projections is improved in the
research by eliminating discovered observations from the original input data using local load information. The paper
by Ngo et al. [45] demonstrated that using the proposed method in distributed hierarchical edge computing (HEC)
systems reduces the detection delay by approximately 71% while the accuracy is maintained. Anomaly detection
models for univariate data in the model are built by using AEs. To associate with the three corresponding levels of
HEC, the researchers proposed three AE-based models—AE-IoT, AE-Edge, and AECloud. The models have three,
ﬁve, and seven layers to learn different features for data representation.

The wavelet autoencoder anomaly detection (WAAD) technique [46] initially uses a discrete wavelet transform to
produce wavelet transform coefﬁcients by applying a sliding time window to a time-series. The method is applicable
It then encodes and decodes (reconstructs) these
on non-stationary and non-periodic univariate time-series data.

coefﬁcients using an AE. For every time window, WAAD determines the reconstruction error and obtains to detect
anomalous data. To identify local and global anomalies, Chang et al. designed a hierarchical anomaly detection
architecture in [47]. High detection accuracy is obtained by combining both edge and cloud servers, respectively.
Local anomaly detection focuses on the consistency of the data pattern of individual devices using the Gated Recurrent
Unit, which is subsequently sent to the cloud where the global anomaly detection procedure is conducted. The Global
IoT anomaly detection looks at how various IoT devices communicate data and uses Conditional Random Fields for
detection.

The paper by Yin et al. [48] proposes a new architecture that integrates the convolutional neural network (CNN) and
LSTM-based AE. The data from all sensors are collected and delivered to the processing center. Temporal features are
extracted using a two-stage sliding window, and higher-level spatial features can be extracted using CNN. The LSTM
is then applied to extract high-level temporal characteristics. On the other hand, the C-LSTM model [49] consists of
CNN, LSTM-based AE, and deep neural network (DNN) for anomaly detection. This technique applies two-stage
sliding window processing to the data for high-level feature extraction. The reconstruction error is used to estimate
anomalies in the method.

The HDoutliers algorithm is a powerful unsupervised method for discovering abnormalities in high-dimensional
data based on a distributional model that allows outliers to be tagged with a probability. The algorithm tackles the
curse of dimensionality, scalability, categorical variables, and non-normal distributions. To overcome the shortcomings
of HDoutliers, the paper by Talagala et al.
[50] offers an improved technique for anomaly detection that uses
higher-dimensional data, called the stray algorithm.

4.2 Monitoring the health of machinery

In contrast to the previous category, which looked at general time-series data, this category monitors the application
data ﬂowing from IoT sensors attached to industrial machinery and seeks machine faults.
The proposed
Mahalanobis–Taguchi method [55] is used to detect changes in the mechanical condition of the facilities. This
technique can be used to keep an eye on the level of fatigue in logistic systems. Researchers in the paper have studied
ways to detect damage to rotating equipment, such as bearings and gearboxes. By using the Mahalanobis distance,
the method can calculate the feature vectors of the anomaly vibration data. A condition-based maintenance (CBM)
approach can minimize scheduled and unscheduled breakdowns, as well as losses in production. CBM’s primary
purpose is to spot anomalies and anomalies that don’t conform to any explicit laws and monitor those anomalies while
they are still in progress. The Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) technique is used in Li et al.’s work [5] to

IoT Anomaly Detection Methods and Applications: A Survey

design a condition monitoring system for machinery equipment. In this approach, sensor data is sent to a server that
then locates the cause of the anomalies in time and decides how much damage has been done. It uses wavelet packet
decomposition to extract the features of the vibration signal.

4.3 Robotics or manufacturing applications

The third category inputs application data for anomaly detection in robotics and manufacturing. In the paper by Chen
et al.
[56] a real-time anomaly detection system for industrial robots was created using a variational AE (VAE).
The method was tested by injecting faults into the robot and observing how the robot resolved them. To cope with
multiple time-series data, the proposed model can detect anomalies spatially and temporally. Another novel method
to detect anomalies in the manufacturing process in [57] implements an unsupervised feature reduction method based
on mutual information (MI) and conditional mutual information (CMI). A clustering model based on density peak
(DP)-weighted fuzzy C-means (WFCM) is proposed to detect anomalies. An anomaly detection method for gearbox
oil temperature utilizing SCADA data is proposed in [58]. In the process, domain knowledge such as wind speed,
power, low/high-speed shaft temperature, and intake oil temperature, respectively, Pearson correlation and Spearman
rank correlation are used to measure the association between gearbox oil temperature and other directly related factors
or indirectly related.

4.4 Detection applications for IoT sensors

The IoT-CAD method [59] proposes a context-aware adaptive data-driven monitoring system for IoT systems that
can detect changes in sensor signals caused by an unexpected event in the environment. The process considers the
correlation between the levels of oxygen, ammonia, and nitrate in the water tanks. The model is made to be adaptable
and able to self-update. By monitoring changes in temperature and pressure, the model can detect anomalous rises
in nitrate levels. Alternatively, Cui et al.’s approach [60] uses Spatio-temporal correlation to detect anomalies in IoT
sensors. The method has two stages: (i) the anomaly source identiﬁcation stage is completed by a fuzzy logic system
based on Spatio-temporal correlation, and (ii) the anomaly detection stage using a composite distance metric and
sensor clustering. The approach exploits the temporal sequence to get the historical spatial correlation degree, i.e.,
historical feature parameters.

4.5 Other industrial or manufacturing applications

Other approaches include merging edge devices’ electricity data with weather data allows [61] method to create a
sparse anomaly perception model. By following this method, anomalous data can be labeled quickly and efﬁciently.
Navigation and planning tasks are particularly vulnerable to driving errors in autonomous vehicles. The safety and
security of connected autonomous vehicles’ passengers are essential for the development of autonomous vehicles. The
method by Zekry et al. [62] proposes an IoT sensor-assisted convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) model
for connected vehicles for anomaly detection. The method by Wang et al. [63] targets log anomalies in large-scale
IoT systems. Using a natural language processing approach, the researchers extracted the relevance between words
and vectorized them. The method trains supervised models (Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks) to
detect anomalies and cites a 30x reduction in computational time. Dang et al. [64] proposes a novel monotone split and
Conquer (MSC) strategy to detect short and long forms of anomalies. The MSC model has an ofﬂine training phase
and an online detection phase. The method extracts sub-trends from the data and uses the multi-scale PCA algorithm
to generate a normal data proﬁle.

4.6 Smart-city IoT applications

Smart-city and urban applications include the paper by Xu et al. [52] proposed an integrated IoT anomaly detection
method, dubbed I-LSTM, presented based on the concept drift adaptive and deep learning methods to detect anomalies
in smart-city data. The effectiveness of I-LSTM is with a smooth activation function for multi-classiﬁcation anomaly
detection, which can obtain the speciﬁc anomaly classiﬁcation to improve the integrated quality of service of a
smart home. To differentiate valid and noisy Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals collected from wearable devices,
the quality assessment lightweight PPG method [51] employs the Mahalanobis distance measure. The approach
is non-invasive and is suitable for monitoring vital indicators such as heart rate, breathing rate, and blood oxygen
saturation without subjecting the patient to procedures that could become unnecessary.

Smart cameras and temperature-meters tied to an edge gateway at quick service restaurants predict demand, creating
timely alerts and intelligent decisions for proactive waste management. The approach by Aytaç and Korçak [53] is one

10

edge environment of IoT. The stored data are ﬁrst broken down into separate groups with the K-means clustering or
Lloyd’s method. Following the implementation of the clustering method, the experiment is executed to determine the
correctness of the clustering results. Then anomalies are discovered based on the Bhattacharyya distances. Another
application is in the medical sector to protect the safety and privacy of the patient’s personal and medical data in a
smart city, the paper by Tripathi et al. [54] proposed the Smart Medical System (SMS) method. Classical healthcare
systems were shown to have notable shortcomings and their incompatibility with smart city systems. The proposed
framework suggests safe, rapid, reliable, and transparent city-wide connectivity based on IoT, MEC, and blockchain
consensus processes. Because the data need to travel only a small distance between the sensor and the edge nodes, it
is faster, uses less energy, and is more cost-effective with fewer data losses.

4.7 Surveillance and video IoT applications

This category includes IoT anomaly detection algorithms that make use of application data from cameras and remote
sensing sensors. Inadequate monitoring of electrical equipment can result in massive economic losses and societal
impacts. Hou et al. [65] proposed an image anomaly detection method for IoT equipment based on deep learning for
both personnel identiﬁcation and ﬁre smoke detection to address the problem. The researchers used the approach to
monitor the safety of the power equipment’s working environment and people identiﬁcation, and ﬁre smoke detection.
The main contribution includes introducing color features, texture features, and shape irregularities to increase the
recognition rate. Furthermore, based on deep convolutional neural networks, the algorithm detects ﬁre smoke.

Another is a surveillance system developed for hostile environments for the Tunisian army, dubbed Read-IoT [66].
The project’s primary goal is to design a system for monitoring security threats that is both dependable and complete.
The proposed system, READ-IoT, applies to IoT networks of heterogeneous objects such as cameras, sensors, and
drones. The READ-IoT framework responds to real-time constraints and helps to reduce system downtime for cloud
or fog computing. Threat detection is handled automatically and appropriate responses are executed. The approach
requires cascaded activation of detection components. Data from each subsystem (anomaly detection system and event
detection system) are funneled into a centralized source for effective decisions in the ﬁeld.

The third is a proposed framework by Ullah et al.
[67] that reduces the amount of time required to identify
abnormal occurrences in surveillance networks. The proposed system incorporates bi-directional LSTM with CNN
characteristics to identify and classify anomalous incidents in the real world.
In this pipeline, CNN features are
collected from successive frames, and then a new multi-layer LSTM is used to distinguish the normal and abnormal.
The deep features and multi-layer BD-LSTM provide ﬂexible, high-level training and validation data to real-world
surveillance networks. This framework might be used by law enforcement at airports and hospitals, for example.

4.8 General-purpose frameworks

With network and application data, the following four categories outline the recent frameworks and their applications.
General-purpose frameworks include the robust anomaly detection framework (RAD Framework) [68] developed
for less reliable data. The framework utilizes SVM, KNN, random forest, and nearest centroid classiﬁers. The
authors claim to achieve an accuracy of up to 98% for attacks on IoT devices and cluster failure prediction, and
comment that the accuracy reduction is due to general reduction in clean data and noise pollution. For industrial
IoT applications, Wang and Ahn [69] found that monitoring current power consumption is not sufﬁcient to meet
the second-by-second balance between power consumption and generation. To approach the problem, the article
proposes a hybrid one-step-ahead load predictor (OSA-LP) and a rule-engine-based load anomaly detector (RE-AD),
a framework that could detect anomalies in residential power usage in real-time. Koduru et al. [70] proposed another
framework that creates a pipeline for a weather monitoring system. The framework uses a few sensors to provide
information on any unexpected weather changes, and the ﬁndings are displayed on a smartphone.

4.9 Frameworks for network applications

The frameworks that make use of network data fall into the following group. From a network, network security, and
communication standpoint, AnoML-IoT [71] is a data science pipeline that integrates several wireless communication
protocols, anomaly detection algorithms, and deployment to edge, fog, and cloud platforms with little user input. The
pipeline covers four major phases: data intake, model training, model deployment, inference, and maintenance. The
DeL-IoT framework [72] for IoT anomaly identiﬁcation and prediction uses a deep ensemble learning technique to
identify anomalies. The framework detects IoT abnormalities by dynamically observing packet and ﬂow level trafﬁc
instances that pass through SDN switches and system metrics. In the scalable framework by Mirsky et al. [73], a
distributed and collaborative anomaly detection algorithm is created using the concept of blockchain. The method
uses a probabilistic model called a Markov chain (MC) to simulate sequences efﬁciently. An et al. [74] proposed

11

IoT Anomaly Detection Methods and Applications: A Survey

a unique anomaly detection framework for the IoT, which is capable of relieving network congestion and central
processing units (CPUs) from the computing pressures of centralized servers while unlocking the potential of edge
intelligence (EI) in the IoT. The framework uses clustering and classiﬁcation algorithms sequentially.

4.10 User security and privacy preserving frameworks

Frameworks that incorporate user security and privacy, like the paper by Liu et al. [75] proposes a framework for
on-device personal data processing and handles user data locally. An attention mechanism-based neural network is
used in this on-device federated learning framework. As part of this system, each edge device utilizes the local dataset
to train the global model supplied by the cloud aggregator and then transfers the gradients back to the cloud aggregator
until convergence. Decentralized Industrial IoT devices might make use of global anomaly detection algorithms in this
way. The MIoT framework [76] provides a multi-dimensional view of the anomalies and the accompanying issues.
The model considers two kinds of content anomalies: tight content anomalies, in which the complete set of reference
keywords must be included in the related transactions, and loose content anomalies, in which at least one of the
reference keywords must be present. Another paper [77] proposes a more efﬁcient approach for detecting malicious
behavior in SDN and edge computing networks. The method helps verify the trustworthiness of edge devices for data
forwarding while maintaining data secrecy throughout data transmission and exchange.

4.11 Other frameworks

Other frameworks like the paper by Li et al. [78] use sensor processing, smart meter readings, and a blockchain to
detect anomalies in electricity use accurately and on time. Using the system, factories and residents can be warned
to reduce electricity use. Anomaly detection in IoT data is performed using a service selection framework by Yang
et al. [79]. The model utilizes a rapid classiﬁcation algorithm, which is an XGBoost implementation that is taught to
recognize distinct stream data patterns and allow for the training of new decision models.

4.12 Network trafﬁc in IoT

Network trafﬁc analysis (NTA) is a specialized topic within network trafﬁc prediction. In ad hoc IoT networks, such
as when using ML-based NTM methods, training is time-consuming, and unexpected occurrences or departures are
often missed. TONTA [80], a suggested online anomaly and trend change detection technique, is used by all nodes
responsible for data forwarding. Although TONTA identiﬁes the predominant trend changes, some events can cause
jitters, e.g., performance of communication protocols and network congestion, to name a few. The Green Energy
Efﬁcient Routing with Deep Learning Based Anomaly Detection (GEERDLAD) model [81] provides an effective use
of energy to help increase the network span. Anomaly detection in the IoT communication networks is carried out
in the algorithm through the recurrent neural network-long short term memory (RNN-LSTM) model. Furthermore,
the paper by Shen et al. [82] proposes a privacy-preserving SVM training strategy, called secure SVM. The method
uses encrypted IoT data, in which data providers encrypt their data locally using their private keys and then record the
encrypted data on the blockchain through specially structured transactions.

4.13 Security applications for IoT devices and infrastructure

The IoT anomaly detection community is focused primarily on security applications. Because of the large number of
publications in this sector, it is not possible to cover all of them; nonetheless, we have categorized security applications
into three categories - (i) devices and infrastructure, (ii) data transport, and (iii) miscellaneous applications. This
section discusses the ﬁrst of the three categories, devices and infrastructure, which use a combination of streaming
application data and network data to identify security anomalies affecting connected hardware devices.

In Pathak et al.’s paper [83], the researchers used the isolation forest approach to detect sensor tampering. Sensor
tampering is detected using network trafﬁc data and is applicable in an industrial and ofﬁce environment. The algorithm
takes packet length, packet-length-daily count, and hash value as input, along with the Silhouette coefﬁcient metric for
evaluating the goodness of a clustering technique. A distributed and self-learning approach, DIOT is an autonomous,
self-propelling system that aims to ﬁnd compromised IoT devices. It automates device-speciﬁc communication proﬁles
built on through device-type-speciﬁc communication proﬁles with no human intervention or labeled data, which are
used to detect anomalies in devices’ behavior. The paper by Nguyen et al. [21] has a dedicated model for each device
type for different IoT devices with different behaviors. To improve global model accuracy, the DIOT approach by
Yahyaoui et al. [84] has an ensembler part aggregating changes from multiple sources and then optimizes the model’s
accuracy. Instead of having two gates for each memory cell, they only use two gates in total, the Reset gate and Update
gate. The approach is for AI-powered anomaly detection on IoT networks, utilizing federated learning. The system
has a Virtual Instance, a local deep learning model, and an ensembler component with a high-level architecture.

12

IoT Anomaly Detection Methods and Applications: A Survey

The design of a distributed anomaly-detection system involves implementing a graph neural network (GNN) method
[85]. This system is designed to thoroughly monitor all of the network’s infrastructure. GNN monitoring is performed
to monitor nodes and devices connected to those nodes using the underlying graph structure. To protect private data
from home devices, Venkatraman et al. [86] used a Probabilistic Timed Automaton (PTA) to model the activities of
smart devices, keeping intruders from stealing conﬁdential data. Furthermore, Said et al. [87] use the support vector
machine (SVM) classiﬁer to help preserve data accuracy while avoiding sending false alerts to hospital infrastructure.
Body temperature and heartbeat data are among the applications.

4.14 Security application for IoT data transport

The second category of IoT anomaly detection for security applications is data transport. The methods used in this
application provide secure and uncompromised transit of application data through the network and identify malleable
attacks such as man-in-the-middle and trojans. Niraja et al. [88] propose an adaptive hybrid strategy for near-real-time
detection of IoT cyberattacks to improve IoT security. It is based on the integration of deep AE and feature extraction.
During the process, it performs encoding and decoding to have the data compressed and reconstructed, respectively,
to detect anomalies or attack trafﬁc generated by compromised IoT devices. Fouad et al. [89] propose a technique to
detect attacks, trojans, and malfunctions. It is beneﬁcial for the detection of attacks with low training samples. Hidden
Markov models (HMM) are used in all aspects of the model, and power signature analysis is used to detect anomalies.
Developing new methodologies to discover compromised IoT devices is imperative as there will be signiﬁcant impacts
if IoT botnet attacks are left unmanaged. The proposed method by Shorman et al. [90] makes the main contribution
in botnet attack detection using the Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm. The Song et al.’s technique [91] uses a deep
packet inspection (DPI) approach and is based on the Three Sigma Rule and Hurst parameter. Using DPI-based
solutions, network operators can provide a detailed view of network usage, identify heavy users, and respond quickly
to network trafﬁc. This is useful for ﬁnding and preventing network abnormalities that lead to increased use of router
resources.

4.15 Other security applications

The third security category is miscellaneous and covers applications that indirectly affect IoT sensors, infrastructure,
application, network, or ML models. For example, in MLOps, where continuous delivery and execution of ML
software in containers such as Docker containers running in Kubernetes are required, network data are utilized to
evaluate whether an unexpected container shutdown is from a security attack. In a distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attack, the network is bottlenecked by incoming handshaking requests.

The article by Vu et al. [92] presents a learning approach that inherits the strength of supervised learning approaches
to identify known threats to VAEs. VAEs learn to map incoming data into a single area in its bottleneck layer using the
standard Gaussian shape. The experimental ﬁndings indicate that the proposed models can map nonlinear separable
normal and attack data in their original space to linear and isolated data in their latent feature space. Wang’s paper
[97] suggests a network-monitoring algorithm built around a cluster-based routing method. Cyber-attacks like DDoS
attacks are detected with this method. The credibility level is evaluated, and anomalous activity is monitored with a
trusted function module in this approach.

The edge network, including routers and switches in locations such as the airport and gateway, is safeguarded
with a proposed ensemble one-class statistical learning model by Moustafa et al.
[93] that implements Gaussian
Mixture-based Correntropy. The proposed system aims to identify zero-day attacks and also attempts to develop
a legitimate proﬁle for new data ﬂows as they occur. Data mining methodologies that include clustering and
rule discovery, statical approaches, and machine learning approaches have been the core hierarchy for anomaly
detection-based intrusion detection systems.
The proposed system called IoT-based Intrusion Detection and
Classiﬁcation System using Convolutional Neural Network (IoT-IDCS-CNN) [94] has three subsystems: a feature
engineering subsystem, a feature learning subsystem, and a trafﬁc classiﬁcation subsystem. The paper by Dymora and
Mazurek [95] used fractal analysis to identify potential security problems in a network. Based on the ﬁndings of the
paper, it appears that it would be possible to detect both short-term attacks and more intense ones. Basati and Faghih’s
approach [96] proposes a real-time network intrusion detection system that employs two AEs in parallel to monitor
the network and a feature reduction deep AE to identify the most distinct features.

A stacked ensemble meta-learning (SEM) model [98] is proposed to boost the effectiveness of the base machine
learning model for IoT device anomaly detection. This design builds a higher-level prediction model that encompasses
the predictions of base classiﬁers that have low accuracy. To have a high-level prediction, the approach utilizes a
meta-learning prediction approach. The goal of Bhatia and Sangwan’s paper [99] is to make debugging and explaining

13

IoT Anomaly Detection Methods and Applications: A Survey

easier using fewer features. The approach uses an ensemble feature selection to eliminate the bias of individual feature
selection methods during the ensemble and identiﬁes the optimal subset with non-redundant and relevant features.

Furthermore, Kurt et al. [100] propose extracting useful univariate summary statistics from observed high-dimensional
data and performing anomaly detection in a single-dimensional space. Suppose that the observed data have low
intrinsic dimensionality. In that case, the method learns a submanifold in which the nominal data are embedded and
determines whether the sequentially acquired data persistently deviate from the nominal submanifold. In the general
case, Geometric Entropy Minimization is used to learn an acceptance region for nominal data and evaluate whether
the sequentially observed data consistently fall outside the acceptance region.

4.16 Miscellaneous IoT applications

IoT anomaly detection is still a developing ﬁeld, with some applications receiving fewer publications than others. The
last category, miscellaneous, includes applications in their early stages of development. This includes the paper by Liu
et al. [102], which discussed the data acquired by several mining sensors and the requirement for real-time tracking
of safety warnings. Construction safety monitoring is performed to look for inconsistencies in the data gathered by
the sensors. In this approach, anomaly detection tasks are separated from the sensor and sink nodes and assigned to
distinct nodes in the network. Then, algorithms are built for each kind of node, allowing for more processing ﬂexibility.
In noisy environments, the ITrust model [101] can detect anomalous or faulty nodes more effectively than current trust
models. This model is primarily intended for underwater acoustic sensor networks. The ITrust, which contains four
trust metrics (communication trust, data trust, energy trust, and environmental trust), is built on the isolation forest
algorithm. The paper by Min et al. [4] proposes a framework for Mobile Horse Racing Betting (MHRB) relying on
IoT sensors, devices, and applications. The framework considers recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term
memory (LSTM), and statistical methods to discover insider trading. Furthermore, as IoT devices collect an enormous

developed to identify anomalies in such scenarios. The method uses a stacking approach, which is an effective way to
evaluate data without a label. It is used to discover records with uncertain data and eliminate them.

The section concludes with a table in 2 of ﬁfteen articles having a distinct application domain and with the highest
citation count from 2019 until July 2021 (ﬁve for each year).

5 Conclusions and new perspectives

The frequency of publication in IoT anomaly detection shows that the ﬁeld is still in its early stages. Anomaly
detection algorithms are classiﬁed into four categories, which are brieﬂy summarized in this review.
It also lists
the most commonly used keywords and applications and identiﬁes application domains that require further research.
Lastly, based on our search criteria, this review discusses 64 novel papers published between January 2019 and July
2021, each with a distinct application domain. As per our current knowledge, there is no single best generic algorithm
for the problem but rather a number of methods speciﬁc to a particular application. In this section, we attempt to
narrow down a large number of possibilities to some of the most signiﬁcant issues facing the ﬁeld today. The new
perspectives are beneﬁcial for univariate, multivariate, as well as for dealing with high-dimensional data. They are:

• Unsupervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised approach:

Obtaining labeled training data is time-consuming, expensive, and not always possible. Furthermore, the
labeled data may not accurately represent all anomalous data present in the dataset. There may also be an
imbalance between the types of anomalous data present for training and testing. As a result, a self-supervised,
semi-supervised, and unsupervised algorithm, especially as an online approach, that can achieve detection
accuracy comparable to that of supervised approaches is desirable.

• Detection for multi-representation data trafﬁc:

The representation data from one or more types of sensors may be sent over the same data pipeline. One
such use is external building proﬁling in an urban environment [116], which involves the integration of RGB
cameras with sensors such as hyperspectral, LiDAR, and thermal, among others. A detection algorithm
capable of handling volumes of multi-representation data ﬂow at scale and with great precision and recall is
viable for these types of applications.

15

IoT Anomaly Detection Methods and Applications: A Survey

• Drift adaptation:

A factor in the accuracy of a trained model is the distribution and quality of the data available during the
training process. Over time, when the distribution of the incoming trafﬁc differs from the distribution of the
training data, there is a data drift [117]. In such cases, it is common for the model to require re-training. It
is preferable for an anomaly detection model to take a more proactive strategy to adapt to incoming data or
concept drifts.

• Learning and testing from augmented data:

In order to train a classiﬁcation algorithm, it is necessary to have enough accurate and reliable data. This
is especially true for the binary classiﬁcation of anomaly detection. However, when there are insufﬁcient
data available for one or more classes, statistical and machine learning-based data augmentation methods
such as the generative adversarial network (GAN) generate more training samples [118]. A robust detection
technique that utilizes data augmentation in model training and software testing is required for applications
with insufﬁcient data.
