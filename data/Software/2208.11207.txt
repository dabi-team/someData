Abstract—The pervasiveness of the Internet of Things (IoT)
has enabled the administration of a large number of intelligent
devices. However, IoT is based on centralised models, which
introduce a number of problems, such as a single point of failure
and security risks. Blockchain may offer a viable option for
addressing these concerns. Practically, both blockchain and IoT
are complex technologies posing further challenges in assessing
application performance. The availability of a reliable simulation
environment for Blockchain based IoT applications would be a
major aid in the development and evaluation of such applications.
Our research has found that
currently there are no simula-
tors with a comprehensive set of features, for the development
and evaluation of blockchain based IoT applications, which is
the main motivation for our work. The purpose of this study
is to gather the opinions of experts regarding the creation of a
simulation environment for IoT based blockchain applications.
To do this, we utilise two separate investigations. First, a
questionnaire is developed to ensure that the development of
such simulation software would be of signiﬁcant use. Second,
interviews with participants are performed to gain their per-
spectives on the primary issues they face with blockchain-based
IoT applications. In addition, the interviews focused on collecting
the perspectives of participants on how blockchain may improve
IoT and how to identify blockchain’s applicability in IoT. Our
ﬁndings demonstrate that the participants had a great deal of
conﬁdence in blockchain to resolve IoT issues. However, they
lack the tools necessary to assess this concept. This highlights
their requirement for a simulator to analyse the integration of
blockchain and IoT.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a pervasive network of
interconnected things (For example, sensors, actuators, smart
TV and smart cars) that can connect and exchange data with
other devices or users. Formally, IoT consists of a number of
essential components [1]. First, things sense an environment’s
parameters, and transmit their values to local edge devices
or to central Cloud servers for processing. This occurs via
the second component which is the gateways. These gateways
are the mediators among things, edge devices, and the cloud,
which support the required connectivity, security, as well as
data ﬂow [2]. The third and fourth components are local edge
devices for small scale data processing, and/or cloud infras-
tructure, which comprises huge pools of virtualised resources

(For example, storage and processing devices) possessing
ultra-fast processing and analytical power [3].

Certain challenges have emerged with IoT security, espe-
cially in privacy which hinders the adoption of IoT appli-
cations. Speciﬁcally, central IoT servers are responsible for
managing users’ sensitive data, which, in turn, could affect
privacy and cause privacy violations [4]. Internet of Things
applications are wide ranging, including health based appli-
cations, environmental and Geospatial applications. Many of
these applications involve the exchange of sensitive and private
data. An important question therefore poses itself; how can we
ensure that this data has not been altered tampered with, or
misused? This question is particularly pertinent to the cen-
tralised IoT architectures, which have to deal with the single
point of failure problem. Also a centralised architecture for IoT
applications where potentially huge volumes of data are being
exchanged may have a negative impact on the performance
of such applications, slowing them down to levels that could
make them dangerous, for example in cases where a hospital
does not get patient data at critical moments [5]. Thus, there
is a need to explore decentralised models for implementing
IoT applications. The peer-to-peer (P2P) model for handling
large exchanges between IoT devices has the potential to
fundamentally reduce the cost of employing servers [6]. It
also distributes processing tasks over a larger number of
devices. Consequently, failure of any single device in the
network will not result in failure, thus meeting fault tolerance
requirements. Additionally, the immense cost of servers, their
operating systems and maintenance is averted by way of such
P2P networks [7]. Nevertheless, adopting this P2P model will
come with its well-known security issues [8]. It is here where
blockchain, known to be an extended secure P2P network [9]
can be very effective.

Blockchain is widely known to be a tamper-proof and secure
the digital currency of P2P, exhibits
technology. Bitcoin,
the most popular example of employing blockchain technol-
ogy [10]. Typically, blockchain is capable of securing data by
means of transparency where all network participants share
the same data that can only be updated through consensus.
Moreover, blockchain allows us to trace data back to its
initiator in an efﬁcient and low-cost strategy. Therefore there
has been increased interest in exploring the integration of

 
 
 
 
 
 
blockchain technology into IoT Networks. Doing so would
potentially culminate in the development of fully distributed
digital networks that are trustworthy and more efﬁcient [11].
However, both IoT and Blockchain technologies are highly
complex, and so are many of their potential applications.
Therefore the development of accurate and effective simulation
tools that can model and evaluate such applications before they
are implemented in the real world, would be of huge beneﬁt.
Simulators investigate a system’s parameters and behaviour
[12]. They are especially useful with complex systems
that need to be examined before implementation [13] [14].
Blockchain and IoT are good examples that can beneﬁt from
simulation because blockchain and IoT consist of various
interconnected layers [15] [16]. Simulators can substantially
reduce the ﬁnancial costs needed to deploy real blockchain or
IoT systems. Also, simulators allow investigating a system’s
performance under different conﬁguration setups.

In this context, the fundamental objective of this research
is to develop a simulator for analysing the performance of
the
integrated IoT blockchain systems. Motivated by this,
purpose of the current study is to gather the views and
viewpoints of specialists in the area about the design of an
adequate simulator. This was accomplished via the use of a
questionnaire and interviews. The ﬁndings indicate a high level
of support for the design of an Internet of Things blockchain
simulator.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Sec-
tion II covers the related work. Section III presents the
objectives of the study. Section IV presents the paper’s adopted
methods. In Sections V and VI, the results are presented and
discussed. Section VII presents the study’s proposals. The
paper ﬁnishes with the conclusions in section VIII.

II. RELATED WORK

Over the last few years, Blockchain and IoT have been the
focus of much research. In the literature, several attempts have
been made to simulate blockchain [17] or IoT applications [18]
separately. VIBES (Visualisations of Interactive Blockchain
Extended Simulations) [19] was proposed as a conﬁgurable
blockchain simulator to enable end-users to perceive empirical
insights and analytics about blockchain networks. VIBES can
simulate blockchain systems and mimics the effect of speciﬁc
parameter changes on the system. The merits of VIBES are
twofold. First, VIBES is a scalable simulator as it can simulate
systems with thousands of interacting nodes. Second, VIBES
is a fast simulator able to provide fast simulation results.
Faria and Correia [20] proposed a discrete-event blockchain
simulator referred to as BlockSim that is a framework assisting
implementing and evaluating blockchains. It
in designing,
can evaluate the implementation of different blockchains that
are rapidly modelled and simulated. Therefore, BlockSim is
characterised as a dynamic simulator able to simulate systems
over a certain time interval. Yet another attempt referred to
as BlockSim is proposed by Alharby and van Moorsel [21]
that implements proof of work (PoW) as a consensus algo-
rithm for making the agreements about the blockchain’s state.

Moreover, as a discrete-event simulator, BlockSim can test the
effect of different parameter conﬁgurations on the system’s
performance. Another simulator BlockSIM [22] is a resilient
open-source blockchain simulator that enables blockchain de-
signers to evaluate the performance of their designed private
blockchains. The contribution of BlockSIM is twofold. First,
it accurately models the stability of the system. Second, it
accurately simulates the transaction throughput concerning a
given scenario. It can optimise the system’s parameters which,
in turn, allows for testing various scenarios needed for the
build-up of its chains.

Several attempts have been made to simulate IoT ecosys-
tems and their applications. A cloud layer is normally signif-
icant for a wide range of IoT applications; therefore, cloud
simulators are widely used for simulating IoT applications.
The most popular and widely used is the CloudSim toolkit
[23] in which tasks are created in the form of cloudlets to be
processed using virtual machines in the cloud environment.
is mainly designed to simulate the discrete-
Moreover, it
event scenarios while implementing a ﬁve-layer structure. An
interesting aspect of CloudSim is its ability to model CPU
power consumption to shed light on bandwidth and delay pa-
rameters. Due to its success, an improved extended version is
introduced and referred to as CloudAnalyst [24]. CloudAnalyst
extends the core of CloudSim while adding a set of features
to investigate the effect of different conﬁgurations on the
system’s performance. A prominent simulator for modelling
applications on the Edge of IoT networks is iFogSim [25]
which is an extension of the CloudSim simulator. As an
edge layer-dependent simulator, it can simulate real systems
that consider the different aspects ranging from sensing to
processing the data. The main contribution of this simulator is
the simulation of the physical layer. In particular, it can model
the physical component of systems.

To our knowledge, none of the simulators mentioned above
focuses on simulating IoT scenarios (IoT applications that
run on multiple IoT layers, including sensors, edge devices,
communication networks, and cloud). This motivated the de-
velopment of IoTSim [26]. IoTSim is built over the core of
CloudSim to support the task of IoT and big data simulation.
IoTSim follows a three-layer architecture (perception, network
and application layer). These layers are integrated with the
three layers of CloudSim (storage, big data processing and
user code). An important point in this simulator is using
the MapReduce approach, one of the big data handling ap-
proaches. From the practical viewpoint, this is done through
two separated functions: MapCloudlet and ReduceCloudLet.
Finally, IoTSim-Osmosis [27] is a framework that supports
testing and validating IoT applications using the principle of
osmotic computing. It is mainly designed to simulate complex
IoT applications while being deployed on heterogeneous edge,
cloud and SDN environments. Despite the many great efforts
done so far, none of the previously mentioned simulators,
summarised in Table I, focus on simulating the integration
of blockchain with IoT.

III. OBJECTIVES

This paper aims to obtain the opinions and perspectives of
research participants regarding blockchain’s potential contri-
butions to IoT. For example, enabling IoT data transparency
and security. Once the participants’ thoughts are gathered, the
proposed system’s requirements can be established as well as
the required tools and mechanisms. This process is described
in relation to a number of objectives, as follows:

1) To gather the required information from experts in the

ﬁeld regarding:

a) The usage of IoT in our daily life.
b) The most commonly used blockchain types.
c) The IoT data that should be stored on blockchain.
d) The consensus algorithms required for the simula-

tor.

e) The users’ needs as regards the blockchain log.
f) The possibility of using IoT nodes as blockchain

nodes.

2) To provide analytical information regarding:

a) Participants’ opinions about having an integrated

blockchain IoT simulator.

b) Participants’ opinions on modelling various types

of blockchain in the simulator.

3) To design a simulator
blockchain IoT systems.

to validate the integrated

analysis. For statistical analysis, the Cronbach’s Alpha [29] is
calculated using SPSS for the 9 questions resulting in 0.796
data consistency. Evidently, the value exceeds 0.5, which, in
turn, indicates the high reliability and consistency of gathered
information.

C. Research procedures

First, it was necessary to gather quantitative numerical data
through a questionnaire [30], with the aim of developing
robust conclusions. Second, qualitative data was gathered
through interviews with various participants, using a set of
open questions [31]. The ﬁrst approach, the questionnaire,
was disseminated to approximately 25 participants, all of
whom were IoT and blockchain, developers/researchers. With
25 active participants, the statistical analysis was undertaken
using SPSS to understand the participants’ attitudes regarding
blockchain features. To more effectively communicate the
idea, the data analysis results as numeric values are presented
in descriptive graphical format. The question responses were
provided on a Likert scale from 1 (‘strongly disagree’) to 5
(‘strongly agree’). The ﬁndings, presented in the ﬁgures, are
displayed in the V-A. Regarding the second data collection
approach of the interviews, these were undertaken online with
six participants who responded to a set of open questions. An
in-depth description of this process is presented in V-B section.

A. Participants

This paper employed a sequential explanatory design
methodology [28] comprising a questionnaire and interviews.
Overall, there were 25 participants who represented the target
sample of individuals with knowledge of computer science,
with a speciﬁc specialisation in IoT and/or blockchain.

B. Research tools

An online questionnaire with nine closed-ended questions
was prepared using the SurveyMonkey website. The question-
naire was distributed to the participants. This was followed
up by online interviews using Zoom app, with a set of
participants who provided their consent to participate. By
the end of the interview, participants had the opportunity to
complete a form with a set of open questions. This enables
qualitative data to be collected to provide a high level of

The questionnaire begins by asking questions to determine
the participants’ familiarity with the IoT. Speciﬁcally,
the
participants were asked, “To what extent are you familiar
with IoT?” In this case, 25 answers presented in Figure 1
were received from participants regarding their familiarity. The
ﬁgure shows that the majority (eight participants, 32%) are
moderately aware of the IoT, while six participants (24%)
have moderately low familiarity with the IoT. Moreover, four
participants (16%) are highly aware of the IoT, with another
ﬁve participants (20%) possessing moderately high awareness
of the IoT. Conversely, the least number (two participants, 8%)
are completely unaware of the IoT. Accordingly, the selected
participants are a good ﬁt because the majority (moderate and
higher) are aware of the IoT.

As we are discussing two technologies, we also examined
their familiarity with blockchain to feel more conﬁdent about

the participants’ answers. Thus, the participants were asked,
“To what extent are you familiar with blockchain?” In this
instant, 25 responses, presented in Figure 2, were received
from the respective participants regarding their familiarity. The
ﬁgure suggests that the majority (seven participants, 28%)
possess moderately high awareness of blockchain, while six
participants (24%) are very familiar with blockchain. The least
number of participants (two, 8%) are completely unaware of
blockchain, while ﬁve participants (20%) possess moderately
low awareness of blockchain. Additionally, six participants
(24%) are moderately aware of blockchain. Similar to the
participants’ familiarity with the IoT, the selected participants
are a good ﬁt, given that the majority are aware of blockchain.
Subsequently, the participants were asked, “if they believe
that there will be an expansion of blockchain with IoT in the
future” all 25 participants responded to this question, with
their responses presented in Figure 3. It was established that
the majority (eight participants, 32%) highly agreed with this
point. Moreover, six participants (24%) expressed moderately
high agreement with the idea. In total, 11 participants (44%)
either moderately or completely disagreed.

of blockchain technology along with IoT in the future.

Following this, participants were asked, “What are your
thoughts regarding the need to have an IoT blockchain sim-
ulator for helping developers with adjusting the system’s
conﬁgurations?” all 25 participants provided their responses,
summarised in Figure 4. As is apparent from this ﬁgure, nine
participants (36%) strongly agreed with this notion, while
eight participants (32%) agreed with this concept. In total 10
participants (32%) were either neutral or completely disagreed.

Given that the participants are domain experts, we seized
the opportunity to obtain their perspectives regarding storing
the IoT data in blockchain. Therefore, the participants were
asked, “Do you agree that all IoT data should be stored in
the blockchain?” the participants’ responses are presented in
Figure 5. Evidently, the majority disagreed with this statement
(13 participants either disagreed or strongly disagreed). The
reason behind this may be the different scenarios of use
concerning IoT with blockchain. Alternatively, the least num-

to compute system latency and throughput. Accordingly, the
participants were asked for their opinions concerning investi-
gating the log ﬁle. The participants’ responses to this question
are presented in Figure 7. The signiﬁcant point is that the
majority (12 participants) either strongly agreed or agreed with
this idea. Additionally, ﬁve participants expressed neutrality
concerning the statement. Meanwhile, eight participants in
total expressed either moderate or complete disagreement.

Fig. 6. Participants’ thoughts about having multiple consensus algorithm in

Consensus algorithms are of considerable importance in
blockchain because they are used to reach a common agree-
ment (consensus) on the current state of the ledger data.
They also enable unknown peers to be trusted in a dis-
tributed computing environment. Thus,
there is a need to
establish participants’ needs relating to this. A. Accordingly,
the participants were asked, “What are your thoughts on
having multiple consensus algorithms in the simulator?” the
participants’ responses to this question are summarised in
Figure 6. Considering the data more closely, it is apparent
that the majority (eight participants, 32%) agreed with this
notion. Furthermore, ﬁve participants (20%) strongly agreed
with the idea. In total, 11 participants (38%) expressed either
moderate or complete disagreement.

Ultimately, most participants either strongly agreed (seven

the participants were asked about this, with their responses
to this question are presented in Figure 9. According to
the participants’ perspectives, the majority (nine participants,
36%) are neutral towards this. Alternatively, four participants
(16%) agreed, while two participants (8%) strongly agreed.
Finally, ten participants (40%) either strongly disagreed or

For the picture to be complete, Table II matches the ques-

tionnaire questions to the predeﬁned objectives.

B. Interviews

Interviews were conducted with a set of participants to col-
lect information concerning their opinions on using IoT-based
Blockchain, as well as comprehending their requirements
for the simulation software for assessing blockchain-based
IoT. The participants’ responses were assessed from active,
analytical, and critical perspectives, with their suggestions
being clariﬁed. Three questions were posed:

• What are the major challenges you face when dealing
with blockchain-based IoT for any evaluation pur-
poses?

• Which features make blockchain suitable for the IoT?
• What are the anticipated outcomes of utilising

blockchain within the IoT?

P1 stated that “There are many challenges based on the
current proposed model. The obstacle lies in investigating
the performance and cost of these technologies. Also, there
are many proposed simulators for Blockchain and IoT in
the literature; however, each simulator either focuses on IoT
or blockchain. As a researcher, I prefer having a multi-
discipline simulator that can simulate IoT devices in sensing
and sending data to the edge/fog layer then to cloud, while
using blockchain in different layers”. Regarding the second
question, he remarked, “The majority of IoT applications such
as healthcare data is of high importance and needs to be
securely handled. I believe blockchain is a strong ﬁt for this
scenario because of its features (for example, decentralisation)
that dispense a third party to manage data”. Lastly, for the
third question, he suggested that “With the rapid development
of IoT technology and the large number of devices expected
to be connected, I believe blockchain would alleviate security
issues. For example, identity management and access to the
IoT should be more secure and trusted, using a reliable tool
for controlling data access”.

P2 stated concerning the ﬁrst question, ”The main challenge
I faced with the IoT and blockchain technologies is the
difﬁculty of monitoring systems’ performance. “The challenge
is that it does not cover all of my required features. I often use
a cloud simulator to evaluate the system. Having a Blockchain
simulator with IoT features that can track every transac-
tion and system throughput will ease my tasks. This could
become an efﬁcient simulator, utilising both blockchain and
IoT power”. Concerning the second question, the participant
explained that “not all the IoT data are of high importance, but
there is still a need to secure the sensitive data and enhance
privacy”. Finally, he stated that “I believe blockchain can
mitigate several of the IoT issues related to privacy. Also,
blockchain can deﬁne a set of policies needed to control IoT
data access”.

In reply to the ﬁrst question, P3 mentioned that “One of
the most important blockchain-based IoT challenges is system
evaluation because of the heterogeneity and mobility of IoT
devices. Personally, I prefer to assess the system from different
viewpoints, ranging from general performance (computational
time, transaction latency and throughput) to security, but there
is no simulator permitting this”. Responding to the second
question, he said that “Data storage is a crucial metric to
determine the applicability of blockchain with the IoT. The
IoT devices sense the environment and send data in real-
time. This implies that we have plenty of data per second.
Accordingly, blockchain cannot be used as data storage for all
data. Hence, I prefer storing only the most important data; I
think that this can be reliable”. Concerning the third question,
he asserted that “Every single device can be identiﬁed using

a permissioned blockchain network that is used by all parties
involved. This implies that data is generated by an identiﬁed
device (trusted), in the sense that the generated data has a
unique identiﬁcation number, hence ensuring immutability. In
this scenario, it could be appropriate to track the data in the
supply chain context”.

P4 noted concerning the ﬁrst question that “The challenge
is how to obtain various statistics about the system, like the
number of generated transactions, number of blocks and time
of conﬁrmation, both for the block and transaction. These
metrics give me an indicator about the proposed system, which
is essentially the same as the real world and enables me
to make decisions”. Regarding question two, the participant
stated that “IoT data can be immutable and distributed over
time in the blockchain network. Participants in the blockchain
network can ensure the data’s authenticity and that it will
never be tampered with”. Finally, concerning question three,
he remarked that “I advise using blockchain to keep sensitive
IoT data where security is ensured. Also, as IoT devices are
the data source, there is a need for reliable analysis which will
not be carried out if there are no device management criteria.
I believe this can be carried out by blockchain, for example,
using smart contracts”.

P5 commented that “Assessing the system performance is
very important. In the context of blockchain and the IoT, it is
difﬁcult to measure performance without simulation due to the
complexity of both technologies. So, from my point of view, the
simulator enables me to test the system from diverse aspects.
Speciﬁcally, I can conﬁgure the number of IoT devices and
protocols used, while at the same time determine the size of
transactions, either for blockchain or the IoT (end to end)”.
Regarding the second question, he suggested that “One of the
advantages of blockchain is decentralisation, as it can prevent
a single point of failure and bottlenecks from occurring. I
see that blockchain beneﬁts the IoT by ensuring reliable data
transfer”. Finally, he stated “I believe that blockchain would
provide the IoT developers with more secure solutions due to
its features”.

Concerning the ﬁrst question, P6 remarked that “The chal-
lenge lies in determining if the simulator supports more than
one measure, such as latency, throughput, total time, along
with the number of blocks created to analyse the overall
performance of blockchain and the Internet of Things. Based
on my experience, it is difﬁcult to cover all aspects of the IoT
and blockchain simultaneously, but the simulator can cover the
general aspects of both technologies in different scenarios”.
Concerning the second question, he stated that by and large
“Due to the limited processing capabilities of IoT devices,
third-party service providers are generally used to process
additional data. By entrusting sensitive user data to third-
party service providers, users must trust data protection and
privacy. This trust coincides with the danger of breaking data
privacy and policies. Blockchain’s traceability can help in
these situations”. Finally, he expressed that “Blockchain is
a promising choice when it comes to ensuring privacy and
applying security”.

VI. DISCUSSION

A. Questionnaire

As previously stated, we used a questionnaire to gather
the perspectives of 25 individuals who are very acquainted
with IoT and blockchain, as shown by their responses to
questions 1 and 2 , respectively. The participants believe
in blockchain as a means of mitigating the problems facing
the IoT, as depicted in question 3. This aligns with the
results of the ﬁrst two questions. As previously said, IoT
applications will become more important for individuals and
organisations in the next years, despite the fact that they
are now struggling with concerns such as trust, reliability,
security, and performance. Blockchain technology incorporates
a range of features particularly with respect to security, and
IoT application builders, hope that Blockchain may mitigate
the aforementioned concerns. The participants expressed a
positive attitude toward having an integrated simulator to
mimic the behaviour of IoT and blockchain technologies,
there is a
which is illustrated in question 4. Speciﬁcally,
requirement for a simulation tool that can be adopted to assist
with modelling applications that integrate Blockchain with
IoT. The majority of participants were against storing all of
the sensed/gathered data in blockchain, as their responses to
question 5 showed. The reasons underpinning this attitude
are that ﬁrstly,
the IoT senses and collects a tremendous
amount of data per second, while secondly, blockchain is ac-
knowledged as suffering from scalability issues. Accordingly,
specialists may reject this idea to avoid blockchain failure.
Conversely, the majority agree with the beneﬁts of having
multiple consensus algorithms, as depicted in question 6.
This is because multiple consensus algorithms have been
developed in the literature, each having its own procedures
and applications. Consequently, as the applications change,
the required consensus algorithm may change; this is why
different consensus algorithms are necessary in the simulator.
Another notable point is that the majority of participants prefer
capabilities for in-depth investigation of the blockchain logs as
reﬂected in question 7. Speciﬁcally there is a need for carrying
out deep tracking of transactions to investigate potential delays
and other performance issues. Additionally, there is a high
degree of agreement on using IoT devices as blockchain nodes,
as established by question 8. This is intuitive because IoT
micro-elements have reasonable processing power while being
small in size. Finally, in question 9, participants were not in
favour of having a simulator comprising various blockchain
types. The reason behind this was that each type has its own
features. Hence, implementing all of these features in a single
simulator may increase complexity which, in turn, limits its
applicability. By and large, from the questionnaire, we may
deduce the necessity of developing a simulator that can mimic
the integration of blockchain with the IoT.

B. Interview

For a more in-depth understanding, online interviews with
speciﬁc participants were organised. The interview comprised

three questions. As mentioned previously in section V-B,
the ﬁrst question focused on understanding the signiﬁcant
challenges facing the participants. We analysed the six partici-
pants’ responses and determined that performance assessment
is the principal challenge. This is because they must ensure
their developed systems’ smooth performance before initiating
their actual implementation.

Furthermore, there is a clear focus on the need to analyse
performance alongside ensuring safety and data privacy. How-
ever, the existing simulators have their own limitations. The
main one is that only one or two aspects are implemented in
each simulator. Almost all participants lacked the simulator
software to assist with this task. Regardless of a large number
of simulators being developed in the existing literature, no
extensive simulator has been developed that can focus on
analysing the system from various standpoints. While agreeing
to align blockchain with the IoT, the fundamental problem that
hinders the participants is how to assess IoT systems with
blockchain features. Unfortunately, this restricts blockchain’s
applicability with IoT. Moreover, the participants observed that
most of the existing simulators do not support a wide range
of parameter settings, thus limiting the evaluation to a certain
viewpoint while neglecting other informative perspectives.
Additionally, this reﬂects their intuition toward comparing the
developed system with similar systems to obtain an improved
understanding of the system. In this regard, they all expressed
optimism about having a simulator to facilitate their task.

Through analysing the participants’ responses, we observed
that data security and privacy are the most important features;
each of the participants concurred that the majority of the
IoT collected data could be exceedingly sensitive and must
be handled carefully. Further, the participants’ responses con-
veyed how security is a worrying issue related to the IoT. A
further point is that dependency on a third party to ensure
security is usually accomplished using servers. Conversely,
the concept which has made blockchain attractive for dealing
with data, namely that it is tamper proof, has gained con-
siderable attention from the participants. Accordingly, they
anticipate using blockchain to store IoT data to secure it.
This will ensure that the sensed data will never be reverse
tampered. Even so, this was a controversial point, with certain
participants mentioning that blockchain has shortcomings in
terms of scalability. Speciﬁcally, massive amounts of data are
gathered from IoT devices per second. Therefore, storing this
extraordinary volume of data in blockchain may fail. Thus, a
trend has emerged of keeping only the most valuable data in
the chain. Notably, an additional prominent blockchain feature
concerning the IoT is the decentralisation concept.

Finally, responding to the third question, it was apparent
that the participants had considerable conﬁdence in blockchain
as an efﬁcient alternative in relation to the IoT. Without
exception, all of the participants believed that blockchain
offers a lot of potential to address many of IoT’s difﬁculties.
Speciﬁcally, they mentioned that using blockchain could easily
ensure IoT’s data security and privacy. For example, IoT has no
clear device management policies. It is not a straightforward

task to deﬁne who can access one’s device and when. But this
is no longer an issue when using blockchain, because devices
can be registered as blockchain nodes. Therefore, they will
have a clear management role. A further point is that for very
complex applications it can be very difﬁcult to track IoT data
along its journey. This is due to the potentially large number
of devices involved. Conversely, it will become far simpler to
track IoT data using blockchain, where data and transactions
are always time-stamped and up to date, therefore users can
query a product’s status and location at any point in time.

VII. RECOMMENDATIONS

The results presented in the previous sections have evi-
denced a broad belief that blockchain can beneﬁt IoT applica-
tions and enhance its applicability by alleviating its limitations.
Moreover, the majority of participants in our studies agreed
that it is necessary to have an integrated blockchain IoT sim-
ulator to aid in the development and evaluation of application
that integrate blockchain and IoT technologies. On this basis,
we recommend greater research and exploration of the design
and development of an integrated blockchain IoT simulator.
Considering the lack of such a simulator in the literature, this
calls for greater research and the need to attract the attention
of contemporary researchers.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

IoT systems are becoming increasingly widespread. Yet,
they have their own set of
because they are centralised,
constraints. However, it
is anticipated that blockchain has
the potential to unlock new opportunities for IoT. A major
problem is that there is no credible simulator for evaluating
blockchain as a solution for IoT problems. This motivates our
current work to shed light on the design of such a simulator.
To better understand this notion, two studies were conducted
involving a questionnaire and interviews, respectively, involv-
ing a number of experts. The results of the questionnaire
indicate considerable familiarity with IoT and blockchain. The
results also demonstrated a strong belief in blockchain as a
technology that may mitigate a number of IoT’s issues. This
was further conﬁrmed by the results of the interviews with
the experts. Moreover, from the questionnaire and interview
results, we discovered that a primary challenge is the lack of
simulator software with the ability to replicate the behaviour
of IoT applications combined with blockchain. In this context,
the aim of our future work is to provide software that can
simulate IoT integration with blockchain, allowing systems to
be evaluated and validated before they are deployed in the real
world.
