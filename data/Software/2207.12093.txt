Abstract 

This goal of this study is to explore emerging trends in cloud computing technology that can support an economic 
and social change. We apply the methods of entity linking, which links word strings to entities from a knowledge 
base, to extract main keywords in cloud computing from accumulated publications from 2004 to 2021. Results 
suggest  that  in  cloud  computing  research,  “Internet  of  things”  has  an  accelerated  technological  and  scientific 
growth compared to the other topics. Other critical research fields that support the evolution of cloud computing 
are  mathematical  optimization  and  virtual  machine.  In  particular,  results  suggest  that  computer  network, 
encryption, big data and distributed computing are the most fast-growth fields of research in the domain of cloud 
computing. These findings reveal a technological competition between Cloud systems infrastructure, hardware 
development side, and computing and software development to play the main role in technological evolution of 
Cloud Computing. Moreover, this study shows that technological development of virtual machines and computing 
device can be of critical importance to foster an economic and technological change in many sectors. However, 
the implementation of cloud computing has to be supported by skill development, organizational change, and 
adopter engagement, to foster the management and the diffusion of cloud technologies and the exploitation of 
cloud-based infrastructures for competitive advantage of firms in fast-changing markets. This study can provide 
main  information  to  extend  the  knowledge  having  theoretical  implications  to  explain  characteristics  of  the 
evolution of science and technology in this field of research and practical implications of innovation management 
for  the appropriate allocation of resources towards new technological trajectories in cloud computing having a 
potential of growth and beneficial impact in society.

Introduction 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology of the U.S. Department of Commerce (NIST, 2022) defines 

cloud computing as: “a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool 

of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly 

provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction." Cloud computing is a 

basic  technology  for  managing  big  data  and  support  the  development  of  businesses  (Latifian,  2022).  The 

advantages of cloud computing technology for organizations are a fast collection of big data from different sources 

for  decision support in markets to improve effectiveness of services. Moreover, the adoption of cloud computing 

technology  (based  on  storage  and  information  processing)  has  the  great  potential  of  fostering  data-driven 

innovations  in  organizations  with  beneficial  societal  impact  (Cresswell  et  al.,  2022;  Papazoglou  and  Vaquero, 

2012).  In  fact,  cloud  computing  technology  and  big  data  can  support  incremental  innovations  of  products, 

processes and organizations for  competitive advantage in dynamic markets with rapid changes (cf., Coccia, 2017, 

2017a, 2022). Many innovations in could computing technology play  a critical role for increasing productivity and 

quality and reducing costs for higher levels of turnover in firms after the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic 

crisis  (Ardito et al., 2021). Liu and Wang (2022) analyze China automotive companies and show that the quality 

of perceived information and of services in customers is due to user satisfaction in the cloud-based marketing 

system.  Hence,  cloud  services  in  information  technology  are  more  and  more  a  basic  strategy  for  improving 

productivity and efficiency (with cost reduction), the reliability and scalability of organizational systems in markets. 

Ali et al. (2021) show the adoption of cloud-based service is associated with factors of compatibility and  security 

concerns. In this context of a critical role of cloud computing for public and private firms, the goal of this study 

is  to  explore  emerging  trends  in  cloud  computing  technology  that  can  explain  drivers  of  next  technological, 

economic and social change.

Theoretical Framework 

Cloud computing is a technology having the characteristics of general-purpose technologies (GPTs) for manifold 

applications in various industries and organizations (Bresnahan, 2010; Coccia, 2014, Sahal, 1981). Firstly, GPTs 

generates new families of products/processes and support incremental and radical innovations (Helpman, 1998, 

p.3; Lipsey et al.,  1998; cf., Coccia, 2018, 2020a). GPTs support different technological trajectories in every branch 
2 

 
 
of the economy (Freeman and Soete, 1987, pp.56–57; Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995, p.8; Hall and Rosenberg, 

2010).  Secondly,  the  evolution  of  GPTs  is  driven  by  scientific  and  technological  change  that  increase  the 

interaction between scientific fields and inter-related technological systems supporting co-evolutionary pathways 

(Coccia et al., 2021, 2022; Coccia and Finardi, 2013; Coccia, 2018c, 2020; Coccia and Watts, 2020; Coccia, 2018, 

2018c; 2019, 2019a, 2019b; Jovanovic et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2013). GPTs, in these co-evolutionary pathways,  

generate a propagation of  minor and major technological  improvements  in products and processes of  many 

sectors, reducing costs and increasing returns-to-scale (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995; Jovanovic and Rousseau, 

2005). Lipsey et al. (1998, 2005) describe other characteristics of GPTs, such as the scope for improvement, wide 

variety and range of uses and strong complementarities with existing or new technologies having a societal impact 

(cf., Coccia, 2020, 2020b, 2022a). Overall, then, GPTs are complex technologies that support product/process 

innovations in several sectors for a corporate, industrial, institutional, economic, and social change (Coccia, 2018a, 

2020).  The  characteristics  of  GPTs  can  explain  scientific  and  technological  development  of  cloud  computing 

research and technology in markets (Nelson, 2008, p.489; cf., Coccia, 2018a).   

The  goal  of  investigating  here  cloud  computing  technology  and  research  is  to  clarify  aspects  of  the  long-run 

evolution of this technology and predict, whenever possible, technological trajectories having beneficial societal 

impact (cf.., Deshmukh and Mulay, 2021). In this context, the study here analyzes publications that are a main unit 

for scientific and technology analysis of cloud computing technology to show evolutionary pathways (Boyack et 

al., 2009). As matter of fact, bibliometric analyses  of publications can capture information earlier of the cycle of 

technology development, unlike patent analysis (Cozzens et al., 2010; Ding et al., 2000). The idea is to analyze the 

evolution  of  cloud  computing  research  for  detecting  new  technological  trajectories  that  are  basic  in  science, 

technology,  and  society  to  explain  the  evolution  of  this  GPT  and  support  strategic  management  of  R&D 

investments  towards  research  fields  and  technologies  having  a  high  potential  of  growth  and  positive  societal 

impact. Next section presents the methods of this scientific investigation.

Materials and Methods 

3.1. 

Sample and Data Collection 

To address the main question of this research, we used the Web of Science- WOS (2021) core collection database 

for extracting the articles related to Cloud Computing (in short, CC). The query used to extract the data from Web 

of Science (2021) is: 

TS=("cloud  comput*")  OR  TS=("cloud-comput*")  refine  By:  Document  Types  =  (“Articles  or  Proceeding 

Papers”), Language = (“English”) and Publication Years = (2004-2021). 

The results of this query contain 49,828 documents. This study investigates the period from 2004 to 2021 because 

the first year 2004 indicates the first article published in cloud computing. 

3.2.  Data Processing 
 
We utilized entity linking to extract main keywords in cloud computing from accumulated publications. In this 

Entity Linking 

step, it is necessary to distinguish the relevant, meaningful keywords and identify the main topics that generate 

this research field. There are different approaches to extracting the general topics from documents using Natural 

Language  Processing  (NLP):  topic  modeling  techniques,  such  as  Latent  Dirichlet  Allocation-LDA  (Blei  et  al., 

2003),  Latent  Semantic  Analysis-LSA  (Landauer  et  al.,  1998),  probabilistic  latent  semantic  analysis-PLSA 

(Hofmann, 1999), etc.  These approaches have been used in recent scientific research to identify different subjects 

in a field of study (Coccia et al., 2021, 2022). The topic models are statistical algorithms intended to identify main 

themes  and  topics  within  large  collections  of  unstructured  documents  (Blei,  2012).  These  algorithms  are 

commonly  referred  to  as  "generative"  models,  as  they  assume  that  documents  contain  multiple  topics  in 

accordance with a statistical distribution. The documents are generated using a probabilistic document generation 

process that selects words from topics. The topic modelling algorithm reveals the topic of a document based on 

words  that  appear  in  it,  their  interrelationships,  and  how  they  change  over  time  (Blei,  2012).  It  is  possible  to 

organize many document collections chronologically and therefore see how different topics and topic frequencies 

evolve over time. A topic model with time-stamped are used  by  researchers to capture  this dynamic behavior 

(Chen et al., 2017). Some algorithms have been developed to mine documents chronologically (Blei and Lafferty, 

2006; Wang et al., 2012; Gohr et al., 2009). 

4 

 
 
 
Our analysis used  the entity  linking approach introduced by Cornolti et al. (2013) to identify  the evolution of 

topics in cloud computing technology. The  approach of entity linking, in contrast to other methodologies, instead 

of using a bag of words concept, it tries to identify meaningful sequences (mentions) and can be annotated to 

specific identifiers (entities) retrieved from a catalog. We utilized Wikipedia as one of the most popular catalogs 

in  entity  linking  in  this  study.  We  used  TAGME  software  to  exert  the  entity  linking  for  Cloud  Computing 

documents. It is a powerful tool that can be used to extract meaningful short phrases from an unstructured text 

and link them to Wikipedia entities (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010). We called TagMe’s API version 0.1.3 using 

Python programming language version 3.9.7 and implemented the process through a Jupyter notebook version 

4.6. Following the study by Cuzzola et al. (2015), to cover many Cloud Computing technology relevant terms, we 

merged n abstract and a title of each article as a text. The values for the area under the curve F-score were set as 

the stochastic  setting  of tunable parameters (Epsilon 0.427,  q = 0.16 and Long_text 10).  Because  of  the high 

volume  of  the  documents  being  analyzed  (49,828  articles),  we  used  NVIDIA  GPU  Tesla  P100,  with  60GB 

memory.  This  process  adds  a  column  with  the  name  “annotations”  to  the  original  dataset  containing  topics 

generated  by  the  Entity  Linking  algorithm  to  each  record.  In  the  final  step,  after  implementing  TAGME,  we 

removed topics that are not meaningful in the context of the study. For example, we removed Emerald, Elsevier, 

Hungary, and Budapest related to copyright information at the end of the articles. 

To  discover  trends  in  topics,  we  used  Mann-Kendall's  test  analysis  after  creating  a  topic  using  entity  linking 

method. The Mann-Kendall test is used to identify hot topics within an academic field at a specific moment in 

time  (as  clarified  later).  The  hot  topics  are  those  for  which  there  are  an  increasing  number  of  publications 

(Nederhof and van Wijk, 1997). The identification of hot topics can allow researchers to focus their attention on 

increasing areas of research instead of ones that are in decline (Marrone, 2020). Additionally, we used Kleinberg's 

burst detection algorithm to identify the popularity of topics over time. Kleinberg (2003) observes that hot topics 

initially appear, gain intensity over time, and then gradually dissipate. To find the hottest topics in cloud computing, 

we used the Mann-Kendall test as well as the burst detection algorithm as appropriate methods of inquiry (cf. 

Coccia, 2018b). It should be noted that the results of the two analyses can differ since Mann-Kendall's test tries 

to find topics that increase swiftly, whereas the Burst algorithm tries to show topics that are increased in terms of 

the frequency of occurrences in a text over a period (become hot) and then their importance gradually decreases. 

5 

 
 
  Mann-Kendall’s test 

One  of  the  most  widely  used  statistical  tests  for  finding  trends  in  the  time  series  is  Mann-Kendall  (MK)  test 

(Marrone, 2020; Zhang and Lu, 2009). In this non-parametric test, the correlation between the rank order of the 

observed values and their temporal order in time is considered (Hamed and Rao, 1998). The null hypothesis is 

that  the  sample  data  are  independent  and  randomly  distributed,  or  there  is  a  serial  correlation  among  the 

observation or data sample has not a monotonic trend (Hamed and Rao, 1998; Marrone, 2020; Zhang and Lu, 

2009). We used pyMannKendall python package Version 1.4.2, which is a pure Python implementation of non-

parametric Mann-Kendall trend analysis (Hussain, 2019). Studies show that non-parametric tests require that data 

are  independent,  and,  in  several  situations,  the  observed  data  are  likely  autocorrelated,  resulting  in 

misinterpretation  of  trend-test  results  (Hamed  and  Rao,  1998)  and  an  increased  likelihood  of  falsely  finding 

statistical significance without a trend being apparent, in the presence of positive serial correlation (Cox and Stuart, 

1955). In this paper, we used the variance correction method for to consider serial autocorrelation as proposed by 

Hamed and Rao (1998). We used Theil-Sen estimator to estimate the magnitude of trends identified by Mann-

Kendall test (Zhang and Lu, 2009). The absolute value of slope indicates the speed of change in trends. In this 

study, we used the slope to identify which topic trends are increasing rapidly.  

Topic popularity using Burst Detection 

 
We  used  Kleinberg’s  burst  detection  algorithm  to  identify  the  bursty  topics  from  the  cloud  computing 

publications. Kleinberg (2003) developed an algorithm for identifying topics that appear, boost intensively over 

time,  and  then  gradually  disappear.  In  other  words,  this  algorithm  identifies  periods  in  which  a  term  is 

uncharacteristically frequent or “bursty.” According to Marrone (2020), we can use the Kleinberg algorithm to 

identify bursts in topics and detect hot (increasing  ( topics or cold (decreasing) topics over time (Marrone, 2020). 

We used SCI2 tool V1.3 to implement the Kleinberg burst detection algorithm and visualize the temporal bar 

graph on the cloud computing papers (Sci2 Team, 2009).

Results  

Topic trends 

4.1. 
Table 1 shows the top 20 most quickly increasing topics regarding their frequency of use in the Cloud Computing 

research, deploying  the Mann-Kendall  test. According to this technique,  a distribution can be  considered  as a 

monotonic trend if the p-value is less than 0.05. Moreover, we calculated the Z score as an indicator of normalized 

test statistics, and if the Z is positive, there exists a strictly increasing trend. We also used the slope to find the top 

20 quickly increasing trends.

Note: Z-score is a normalized test statistic of Mann-Kendall test; p-value is a significant level of test p<0.5. The 
items are with an in decreasing order according to the slope. A high slope indicates that the topic increases faster 
than topics with a small slope. The analysis provides a lot of topics but here are presented only the top twenty for 
clearness. 

Table 1 shows that in the domain of cloud computing “Internet of things” with the highest slope value of 174.00 

has been growing fast compared to the other topics. Interestingly, this result illustrates that among the relevant 

entities, Internet of things studies have the highest growth rate in multidisciplinary research of Cloud Computing. 

“Mathematical  optimization”  with  the  slope  value  of  136.42  has  also  the  most  significant  growth  rate  in  the 

number of publications in cloud computing. Accordingly, in Cloud Computing, Mathematical Optimization plays 

a  vital  role  in  developing  the  fundamental  analytical  aspects  of  this  emerging  technology.  After  that,  “Virtual 

Machine” is the third quickest topic in terms of popularity in cloud computing with a slope value of 93.66.  Since 

all the topics hold a positive significant level of p-value and Z score, all trends are upward, but those topics with a 

slope value higher than mean (average of top 20 quickest topics slope values=50.54) can be considered as the 

hottest topic, which has gained momentum these years. In this regard, “Computer network” with a value of 87.143, 

7 

 
 
 
“Encryption” with a value of 82.91, “Big data” with 75.85, and “Distributed computing” with a slope value of 

53.5 are the most fast-growth topics in the field of Cloud Computing. 

Table 1 also shows that the “Particle swarm optimization” with 14.38,  “Computer Cluster” with 15.08, and “Smart 

City” with 15.17 have the lowest slopes. This result suggests that although these topics are gradually growing at a 

stable  rate,  but  not  fast  enough  to  consider  them    hot  topics  in  Cloud  Computing.  These  findings  reveal  a 

technological competition between Cloud systems infrastructure, hardware development side, and computing and 

software development to play the main role in technological evolution of Cloud Computing.  

Figure 1. Top 10 Cloud Computing related technologies based on the Mann-Kendall test  
Note. All items in the legend indicate topics. The analysis provides a lot of topics but here are presented only the 
top ten for clearness. 

Figure 1 displays that “Distributed Computing” from 2008 had the highest number of publications compared with 

other  topics  in  the  field  of  cloud  computing.  After  that,  “mathematical  optimization”,  “Virtual  machine”  and 

“Computer Network” initiated their popularity. We can consider these fields as leading topics until 2014 when 

Big  data  quickly  accelerated,  and  until  the  middle  of  2016,  this  topic  gained  significant  interest  for  scientific 

research in Cloud Computing. It is also interesting to point out that  the trend of “Internet of things” has the year 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
2012 as a main point of acceleration: the number of publications speeded up and increased faster than the other 

topics. The pathway of growth continued until 2021 when this field is the most popular in the research field of 

Cloud Computing . In addition,  the topic of “sensor” is growing gradually, but still at a lower rate than other 

topics.  Although  this  topic's  popularity  is  straggled  from  other  fields,  its  application  as  a  complementary 

technology in critical topics is considerable and it can open new technological directions in cloud computing in 

process of  technological interaction with Internet of things generating a fruitful co-evolution.  

4.2. 

Topics Bursts 

Figure 2 (A-B) visualizes the results of Kleinberg’s bursting algorithm. This figure illustrates the top 100 topics in 

the Cloud Computing research over time. As seen in figure 2 (A-B), each topic has a start point (the year that 

burstness of the topic started) and an endpoint (the year that burstness of the topic ended). The distance between 

these two points indicates the length of topics’ burstness. Moreover, the thickness of the bar of each topic  in 

figure 2 indicates the weight of that topic (frequency of occurrences of the topic in the text) in all documents. 

The first detected bursts in this study started in the year 2008. Based on the weights of topics, the most important 

topic in this year is Grid Computing with a length of 5 years from 2008 to 2012. Service Oriented Architecture is 

in the second rank regarding the weight of topics. All these topics roughly represent the evolution of infrastructure 

and  computation  foundations  of  cloud  computing  technology.  In  later  period,  from  the  year  2018,  “fog 

computing”, “artificial network”, and “remote sensing” boosted, and from the computation side, complementary 

technologies  started  gaining  momentum  in  the  cloud  computing  research.  The  topics  of  “edge  computing”, 

“internet  of  things”,  “deep  learning”,  “machine  learning”,  “blockchain”  and  “reinforcement  learning”  emerge 

from  2019  to  2020  and  are  the  most  weighted  topics  according  to  the  analysis  presented  in  figure  2,  which 

ultimately shows the evolution of knowledge behind the cloud computing from mathematics and infrastructure 

to computing and interdisciplinary. finally, the topics of “quantum computing”, “particle swarm optimization”, 

“elliptic-curve cryptography” and “ciphertext indistinguishability” burst in 2021 and can be considered as the most 

emerging topics in the research field of cloud computing.

Discussions 

Results of the study show that technological ecosystem of cloud computing as a General-purpose technology is 

mainly driven by research fields of “internet of things”, “mathematical optimization” and “virtual machine”. Other 

topics playing a main role are “computer network”, “encryption”, “big data”, and “distributed computing”.  In 

particular, “distributed computing” from 2008  has high level of publications, whereas from 2014 Big data quickly 

accelerated associated to the evolution of IT technology, e.g., software development, that has generated interaction 

with different technologies (e.g., powerful computer, Internet of Things, etc.) and co-evolutionary pathways of 

growth (in fact, data can be collected from mobile applications, social networks, websites, etc.);  finally the trend 

of  “Internet  of  Things”  from  the  year  of  2012  has  a  remarkable  acceleration.  One  of  explanations  of  high 

acceleration of the Internet of Things is because this new technology produced so many data and cloud computing 

algorithms supports the computation and analysis of this big data. A similar explanation is also for virtual machine 

(cf., Table 1 and Figure 1). In general, technological trajectories of cloud computing  have  a takeoff from 2007 to 

2009, whereas since 2019 it seems that they are in a phase of technological maturity. Results also show the main 

evolution of the infrastructure and computation foundations of cloud computing technology. Moreover, results 

show that that from the year 2018, “fog computing”, “artificial network”, and “remote sensing” boosted, instead 

the  topics  of  “edge  computing”,  “internet  of  things”,  “deep  learning”,  “machine  learning”,  “blockchain”  and 

“reinforcement  learning”  emerge  from  2019  to  2020  suggesting  that  the  evolution  of  knowledge  in  cloud 

computing  is  more  and  more  based  on  mathematic  and  software  development,  and  new  infrastructures  and 

equipment.  Finally,  research  topics  “quantum  computing”,  “particle  swarm  optimization”,  “elliptic-curve 

cryptography” and “ciphertext indistinguishability” burst in 2021 and can be considered as the current emerging 

research fields in cloud computing technologies. 

  Theoretical implications. 

Technological trajectory is the activity of technological process along the economic and technological trade-offs 

of the general-purpose technology of cloud computing is driven by technological paradigm of Information and 

Communication Technology, ICT (Dosi 1988; Nelson and Winter 1982). A major impulse to innovation in cloud 

computing that characterizes new technological trajectories (or avenues) just described, it is due to the scientific 

12 

 
 
 
activity in these topics that becomes "endogenized" to support a scientific and technological accumulation and a 

search of profit-motivated for businesses (Dosi, 1988). Moreover, evolution of cloud computing technologies can 

be due to interaction with new processes of innovation in software development, computer technology, Internet 

of Things, etc.

Main  characteristics  of  technological  analysis  here  that  can  support  the  development  of  the  general-purpose 

technology of cloud computing are: 

 

Specialization systems, such as in healthcare and encryption based on the interaction of hardware and software 

elements and big data needed to enable cloud computing.  

  Development of specific infrastructures, such as computing power, servers, network switches, memory and storage 

clusters, as well as new interfaces for users to access to virtual resources.  

  Cloud systems foster the integration of complementary elements of hardware and software (e.g., Internet of Things, 

virtual machine, etc.)  for a common platform and technological ecosystem that can manage multiple clouds 

fostering the co-evolution with a technological parasitism and symbiosis  (Coccia, 2019, 2019a; Coccia and 

Watts, 2020). 

  Exploitation  of  economies  of  scale  because  cloud  infrastructure  supplies  the  same  capabilities  as  physical 

infrastructure but with additional advantages given by a lower cost, greater flexibility, and scalability. 

  Economies of standardization creating similar software, interfaces, platforms and infrastructure for  extensible 

cloud systems,  fostering  interaction  with different technologies and adopters (Choi et al., 2011; Katz and 

Shapiro, 1985; Shapiro and Varian, 1999).

  Principal innovation policy and innovation management implications 

The description of characteristics of evolutionary pathways in the general-purpose technology of cloud computing  

here  can  improve  the  allocation  of  R&D  investments  in  private  and  public  organizations  for  beneficial  social 

impact (Coccia and Rolfo, 2000; Roshani et al., 2021; Pagliaro and Coccia, 2021). In fact, the evolution of cloud 

computing technologies can have numerous applications in emerging markets. Policymakers and scholars know 

that financial resources can be an accelerator factor of progress and diffusion of science and technology to support 

the scientific and technological development (Roshani et al., 2021). This study shows critical research fields and 

technologies in cloud computing that are growing; policy makers can allocate economic resources towards these 

research  fields  having  a  high  potential  of  growth  to  support  the  evolution  of  cloud  computing  technology  in 

interaction with other technologies (e.g., Internet of Things, virtual machine, encryption, big data, new sensors) 

generating  co-evolutionary    for  positive  impact  in  science  and  society.  In  fact,  these  findings  can  support 

policymakers and funding agencies in making efficient decisions regarding sponsoring specific research fields and 

technological trajectories in cloud computing  that can accelerate the development of science and technology and 

foster technology transfer having fruitful effects in markets for wellbeing of people in society. 

6. 

Conclusions 

The evolution of cloud computing technology  is basic to explain main drivers of  technological and social change 

in markets (Cresswell et al., 2022). The study here reveals that cloud computing is mainly driven by interacting 

with main research fields of “internet of things”, “virtual machine”, “computer network”, “encryption” and “big 

data. Latifian (2022) argue that the development of new businesses by the utilization of big data can be effectively 

addressed using cloud computing and related  computing technology.  . In fact, cloud computing is a powerful 

technology  for    storing,  compressing,  analyzing  and  processing  big  data.  However,  these  conclusions  are,  of 

course,  tentative.  The  rapid  evolution  of  cloud  computing  technologies  has  a  lot  of    potential  commercial 

applications, but it can also raise some problems during the implementation in organizations and society. One of 

the  problems  in  the  evolution  of  cloud  computing  is  barriers  to  progress  given  by  transaction  cost  of  data 

migration, lack of know-how for a vast implementation in provider organizations, a lack of standardization and 

central  regulations  (Swann,  2000;  Zhang  et  al.,  2020).  Other  problems  during  the  implementations  of  cloud 

14 

 
 
 
computing technology may be associated with aspects of ethics, privacy and civil rights (cf., Batra et al., 2021; 

Holter et al., 2021; Inglesant et al., 2021 for similar problems in quantum computing).  

Overall,  then,  although  this  study  has  provided  some  interesting,  but  preliminary  results,  it  has  also  some 

limitations. First, the search queries are affected by ambiguous meanings of terms in the cloud computing domain. 

Second limitation is that publication analysis can only capture certain aspects of the evolution of  cloud computing 

d  technology.  Third,  there  are  confounding  factors  that  affect  the  dynamics  of  cloud  computing,  such  as 

equipment of IT platform, skilled human capital, available big data, etc. Despite these limitations, results here 

show main technological trajectories in cloud computing that provide new knowledge of the evolution of this new 

technology for supporting R&D investments in research fields having a high potential of growth in society, such 

as internet of things, virtual machine, big data management, encryption,  etc. (Roshani et al., 2021). To conclude, 

results presented here clearly point out the need for more detailed technology analyses to clarify the structure and 

evolution  of  cloud  computing  technology  to  support  further  implications  for  innovation  management    and 

research policy  that accelerate the development of new science  and technology with fruitful effects for future 

wellbeing of people in society.
