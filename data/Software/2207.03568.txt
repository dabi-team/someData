ABSTRACT 

Background 

Delayed diagnosis of syndesmosis instability can lead to significant morbidity and 

accelerated arthritic change in the ankle joint. Weight-bearing computed tomography 

(WBCT) has shown promising potential for early and reliable detection of isolated 

syndesmotic instability using 3D volumetric measurements. While these measurements 

have been reported to be highly accurate, they are also experience-dependent, time-

consuming, and need a particular 3D measurement software tool that leads the clinicians 

to still show more interest in the conventional diagnostic methods for syndesmotic 

instability. 

Purpose 

The purpose of this study was to increase accuracy, accelerate analysis time, and reduce 

inter-observer bias by automating 3D volume assessment of syndesmosis anatomy using 

WBCT scans.  

Methods 

We conducted a retrospective study using previously collected WBCT scans of patients 

with unilateral syndesmotic instability. 144 bilateral ankle WBCT scans were evaluated 

(48 unstable, 96 control). We developed three deep learning (DL) models for analyzing 

WBCT scans to recognize syndesmosis instability. These three models included two 

state-of-the-art models (Model 1 - 3D convolutional neural network [CNN], and Model 2 

- CNN with long short-term memory [LSTM]), and a new model (Model 3 - differential 

CNN LSTM) that we introduced in this study  

Results 

2 

 
Model 1 failed to analyze the WBCT scans (F1-score = 0). Model 2 only misclassified 

two cases (F1-score = 0.80). Model 3 outperformed Model 2 and achieved a nearly 

perfect performance, misclassifying only one case (F1-score = 0.91) in the control group 

as unstable while being faster than Model 2.  

Conclusion 

We have developed a DL model for 3D WBCT syndesmosis assessment that achieved 

very high accuracy and accelerated analytics. This DL model shows promise for use by 

clinicians to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce measurement bias, and save both time 

and expenditure for the healthcare system.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Syndesmotic instability, left un or misdiagnosed, can lead to long-term complications 

including pain, limited ankle range of motion, and degenerative changes of the ankle joint1,2. 

Given that syndesmosis instability is a three-dimensional phenomenon—occurring in the 

coronal, sagittal, and rotational plane—evaluating the joint as such may help with a more 

accurate diagnosis3,4. Bilateral weight-bearing computed tomography (WBCT) has recently 

received much attention for diagnosing syndesmotic instability mainly due to its ability to 

provide a dynamic bilateral 3D view of the ankle joint under physiologic weight3–6. Ashkani 

Esfahani et al. recently reported 3D WBCT volume measurement of the syndesmosis is to be a 

very reliable technique for diagnosing syndesmotic instability, with an accuracy of 90%, a 

sensitivity of 95.8% (95% confidence interval (CI):87.8-100), and a specificity of 83.3% (95% 

CI: 68.4-98.2)5. Despite the relatively high accuracy of this method, however, manual 3D 

volume measurement proved also to be fairly time-consuming, vulnerable to measurement bias, 

and dependent on specific software tools. Alternative use of a computer-assisted automated 3D 

analysis of the WBCT images that can also compare sides to detect instability, though, could 

potentially hasten diagnosis, reduce measurement bias, and improve overall accuracy. 

Deep learning (DL), an emerging powerful branch of machine learning, has yielded 

numerous breakthroughs for detecting and characterizing musculoskeletal pathologies 7–12 with 

potential application in all other image dependent diagnosis such as skin maladies13–15. DL 

models possess the ability to learn semantically meaningful patterns in imaging data using a 

specific algorithm without being explicitly programmed by humans. This algorithm can 

iteratively adjust and readjust its neural network connections after being repeatedly exposed to 

input data and the desired outcomes. Training a DL model using a sufficient image database 

4 

 
enables the algorithm to distinguish normal from abnormal images in a fraction of a second with 

high accuracy and reproducibility.   

The objective of this research was to train three DL models using bilateral WBCT scans 

of patients with unilateral syndesmotic instability and compare their performance in the detection 

of instability. We hypothesized that DL models can detect an unstable syndesmosis with far 

greater speed and accuracy than more traditional human interpretation.  

2. METHODS 

2.1 Study Design 

After acquiring institutional review board (IRB) approval, a retrospective study was 

conducted using previously collected WBCT data.  

2. 2 Data 

A total of 144 bilateral ankle WBCT scans were evaluated (48 unstable, 96 control). 

These WBCTs were acquired from patients seen between 2016-2020 at an academic hospital. 

Images were obtained using a PedCAT™ device (CurveBeam, Warrington, PA). The exclusion 

criteria were patients younger than 18 years old, not able to bear weight, those with bilateral 

ankle injuries, ipsilateral fracture of the distal tibia with extension to the syndesmotic space or 

posterior tibial tubercle. Demographic and injury data of included patients are shown in Table 1. 

Notably, among patients in the unstable group, WBCT scans were taken 12.6 ± 13.6 months after 

the initial trauma, suggesting that most injuries were chronic. The control group included 

participants with stable ankle and syndesmosis and who had undergone WBCT to assess the 

5 

 
 
 
tarsometatarsal joints, sesamoids, bone fragments, metatarsophalangeal malalignments (i.e. 

Lisfranc instability), or evaluation of the forefoot postoperatively.

2.3 Ground Truth 

Syndesmosis instability was confirmed intraoperatively using arthroscopic assessment or 

via direct examination in open surgery. Following diagnosis, all patients received surgical 

fixation of the syndesmosis.  

2.4 Data Preparation 

All WBCT scans were acquired from the Institutional Patient Data Registry (RPDR) as 

Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files. Prior to analyses, the DICOM 

files were de-identified. On bilateral ankle WBCT images taken in the axial plane, a total of 

thirteen CT slices with a slice thickness of 0.3 mm starting from the tibial plafond up to 5cm 

proximal to the syndesmoses were selected in both the unstable and control groups (Fig. 1). We 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
choose to select thirteen slices to keep the number of inputs to the deep learning models constant 

while making sure that the entire syndesmosis is captured within these slices. Subsequently, all 

CT slices were translated from DICOM to JPEG format. JPEG images were then rescaled to 224 

by 224 pixels and were normalized by dividing each pixel by the maximum pixel value of 255. 

The entire data set (144 individuals, 13 images per individual) was randomly divided into the 

training, validation, and the final test subsets with an 80:10:10 split ratio. This split ratio was 

maintained among the unstable and control groups to ensure that each group had the same 

number of representatives in the training, validation, and test subsets.

slices with a slice thickness of 0.3 mm starting from the tibial plafond up to 5cm proximal to the 
syndesmoses 

2.5 Models 

A WBCT scan consists of a stack of sequential slices. The position of each slice in the 

WBCT scan stack is important when analyzing the WBCT scan. We developed three DL models 

to analyze the WBCT images. The position of each slice in the stack and the diagnostic 

information that could be gained from each slice were captured by comparing one slice to the 

next slices and the previous slices. We developed these models using state-of-the-art methods 

(Model 1 and Model 2) and a new method that we propose (Model 3) for analyzing sequential 

medical images in this study.

2.5.1 Model 1: 3D Convolutional Neural Network 

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are mainly used for analyzing 2D images with 2D 

convolution layers. However, 3D convolution layers can be used in a CNN structure to capture 

features in both the spatial and temporal dimensions. We developed Model 1 with a 3D 

convolution layer that convolved over the entire stack of a given WBCT scan to extract features 

in both spatial and temporal dimensions (Fig. 2). This model essentially “looked” at the entire 

WBCT stack at once to make a decision and categorize a given WBCT scan as “unstable” or 

“control.” Details of Model 1 are shown in Fig. 2. We used random Gaussian distribution 

weights to initialize this model.

2.5.2 Model 2: Convolutional Neural Network -Long Short-Term Memory 

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are a class of neural networks designed for handling 

sequential data. In an RNN model, the output of each step is a function of the output of the 

previous steps. In other words, an RNN model has the “memory” to look back at what has been 

calculated so far at each step and to incorporate that into its calculation for the current step. Long 

Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a variation of vanilla RNN to capture long-range dependencies 

in sequential data. Another variation of LSTM is a multilayer LSTM. Multilayer LSTM stacks

computation capacity for more complicated tasks. 

We combined a CNN model with a multilayer LSTM model to create Model 2 (Fig. 3). 

The CNN model was used to analyze each slice individually and summarize each slice’s 

features. We used a VGG-16 CNN that was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset as a feature 

extractor. Subsequently, those features were fed into the LSTM network. The LSTM network 

remembered the features of all the slices that came before a given slice when it was analyzing 

that slice. This way the spatial information of the individual slices was captured and were 

considered in the overall calculation.

In this model, we used the same structure as Model 2 but used changes between 

successive sequential slices as input (Fig. 4). The input to this DL model was pixel-wise 

subtraction of successive slices (∆I) defined as follows (eq. 1): 

(eq.1) ∆𝐼 =  𝑆𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖 − 𝑆𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖−1 

This model used ∆I as input as opposed to the raw image slices as was done in Model 2. 

By taking ∆I as input, this model could more efficiently focus on the region of interest, in 

particular those aspects of the images that changed between the two image slices. This approach 

also aided in reducing the input “noise”/ “background” information, which was not relevant for 

the task at hand.

criteria. The models were implemented with Tensorflow (version r1.9) with Keras (version 2.2.0) 

backend on Python (version 3.6) running on a workstation comprised of an Intel(R) Xeon(R) 

Gold 6128 processor, 64GB of DDR4 RAM, and an NVIDIA Quadro P5000 graphic card.  

2.7 Evaluation 

After achieving optimum performance on the validation subset the models were tested on 

the holdout test subset, which was isolated from the training process, and the results were 

reported as the models’ performance. We reported a confusion matrix for each model calculating 

sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1-score with an optimum threshold. We also plotted the 

receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) for 

all models. Moreover, we reported the processing time per epoch for each model.  

3. RESULTS 

Figure 5 shows ROC curves with AUC for all models identifying the patients with an 

unstable syndesmosis in the test subset. Model 1 (3D CNN) could not identify any patient (AUC 

= 0.0) while Model 2 (CNN-LSTM) and Model 3 (DCNN-LSTM) had high performances (AUC 

of 0.80 and 0.91, respectively).

4. DISCUSSION 

Integrity of the distal tibiofibular joint is important for conferring stability to the ankle 

mortise, and thereby plays a crucial role in weight transmission during physical activity. 

Detection of syndesmotic instability when it exists, and subsequent restoration of mortise 

integrity, are therefore essential for preventing future degenerative changes of the ankle joint16,17. 

The objective of this research was to train and compare three DL models to detect syndesmotic 

instability using 3D WBCT images of patients with unilateral syndesmotic instability. Our

DCNN-LSTM model was found to exhibit the highest performance, rendering it a promising 

method to equip clinicians with a better and faster diagnostic tool.  

While direct visualization through open or arthroscopic assessment has been purported to 

be the most accurate diagnostic method to evaluate syndesmotic instability, identifying an 

equally accurate non-invasive method has remained somewhat elusive to orthopedic care 

providers 18. WBCT, as a new imaging modality that provides a dynamic 3D ankle view under 

physiologic load, is being used to assess different syndesmotic measures including 

anteroposterior and lateral translation19, fibular rotation20, 2D area assessment21, and 3D volume 

measurements3,5. In a study by Ashkani-Esfahani et al., the predictive values of 2D area and 3D 

volume measurements were compared5. They reported the highest sensitivity (95.8%), and 

specificity (83.3%) for the 3D volumetric measurement up to 5 cm above the tibia plafond with 

an interobserver correlation coefficient of 94%. Although 3D volume measurement seems to be a 

promising and rapidly evolving method for more accurate noninvasive detection of even subtle 

syndesmotic instability, the time-consuming nature of this method in conjunction with the 

relatively poor familiarity of clinicians regarding use of 3D measurement tools—and thus the 

higher propensity for measurement bias—has prevented most care providers from incorporating 

this method 5.  

Clinicians benefit from test simplicity when it can occur without sacrifice of speed, 

economy, or precision. Use of 3D WBCT volumetric analysis for the syndesmosis remains no 

exception to this rule. In this study, we developed three DL models for analyzing WBCT scans to 

recognize syndesmosis instability. These three models included two state-of-the-art models 

(Models 1 and 2) and a new model (Model 3) that we introduced in this study. We found that 

Model 1 could not learn any feature for recognizing syndesmosis instability. Model 3 achieved 

14 

 
higher accuracy than Model 2 while being faster. Model 3 was able to correctly diagnose all the 

patients with syndesmotic instability in the test subset and only misclassified one patient. Model 

3 also achieved high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (90%) than what is reported in the 

literature for the 3D measurement method (sensitivity 95.8%, and specificity 83.3%)5. 

Furthermore, Model 3 analyzed a given WBCT scan automatically in a fraction of a second. 

Although these results show that DL can successfully detect even subtle increased syndesmotic 

volume that can potentially result in syndesmotic instability, the fact that DL models should be 

trained on large databases to be generalizable cannot be overlooked. Our study should therefore 

be considered a pilot for future study of this condition using a more robust database. 

A clear limitation of this study, therefore, remains the relatively small size of its dataset. 

Since WBCT is a relatively new device and as such the number of studied patients are as yet not 

high, we are not yet able to provide greater database analytics for the purposes of this 

investigation. However, our future goal is to expand our data and retrain our model that exhibited 

the highest performance, following which we intend to perform internal and external validation. 

Another limitation of this study was the fact that different weight initialization methods were 

used for Model 1 as compared to Models 2 and 3. Weight initialization sets the weights of a 

neural network to random values as the starting point for model optimization. An alternative 

approach to random weight initialization is transfer learning, which involves reusing the weights 

of a well-trained network to initialize a new network’s weights22. In this study, Model 2 and 

Model 3 were created using a transfer learning approach that implemented CNN models trained 

on the ImageNet dataset as the base model. ImageNet dataset contains over 15 million labeled 

non-medical natural images23. In contrast, Model 1 was trained using random weights with 

Gaussian distribution. We could not use the same transfer learning approach for Model 1, 

15 

 
because it had a 3D convolution base layer as opposed to models 2 and 3 that were trained on the 

ImageNet dataset with a 2D convolution layer. Differences in the weight initialization methods 

may have contributed to the relatively poor performance of Model 1, because it was only trained 

by the dataset available in this study, as opposed to Model 2 and Model 3 that used a well-trained 

base CNN (VGG-16) as a feature extractor.  

5. Conclusion 

In this study, we developed a highly accurate and expedient DL model for detection of 

the unstable syndesmosis using 3D WBCT scans. This method achieved higher performance than 

the state-of-the-art 3D measurement method while being faster and eliminating the risk of 

measurement bias. Future steps will include gathering a larger patient dataset in order to increase 

the validity and reliability of our model. Using heat maps to highlight the level and location of 

the abnormality can be beneficial in building trust and confidence. Internal validation and 

external validation of our model using datasets from other centers should help further validate 

this method and may convince other care providers to use it as a potentially revolutionary new 

diagnostic tool.
