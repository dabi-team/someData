Abstract.

We describe the optimum telescope focal ratio for a two-element, three surface, telecentric image-transfer
microlens-to-ﬁber coupled integral ﬁeld unit within the constraints imposed by micro-optics fabrication and op-
tical aberrations. We create a generalized analytical description of the micro-optics optical parameters from ﬁrst
principals. We ﬁnd that the optical performance, including all aberrations, of a design constrained by an analytic
model considering only spherical aberration and diffraction matches within ±4% of a design optimized by ray-
tracing software such as Zemax. The analytical model does not require any compromise on the available clear
aperture; about 90% mechanical aperture of a hexagonal microlens is available for light collection. The optimum
telescope f-ratio for a 200µm core ﬁber fed at f/3.5 is between f/7 and f/12. We ﬁnd the optimum telescope focal
ratio changes as a function of ﬁber core diameter and ﬁber input beam speed. A telescope focal ratio of f/8 would
support the largest range of ﬁber diameters (100 to 500µm) and ﬁber injection speeds (between f/3 and f/5). The
optimization of telescope and lenslet-coupled ﬁbers is relevant for the design of high-efﬁciency dedicated survey
telescopes, and for retro-ﬁtting existing facilities via introducing focal macro-optics to match the instrument input
requirements.

1 Introduction

Modern day spectroscopic surveys employ collecting apertures running from 10m-class tele-
scopes (VIRUS[1, 2], PFS[3], MSE[4]), to modest 4m-class telescopes (e.g. DESI[5], 4MOST[6]),
down to even a few hundred mm (LVM[7]). At the heart of each of these surveys is ﬁber-
optic coupled spectroscopy. Fiber optics serve as a convenient bridge between the mobile
telescope system and the more stable spectrograph mounts, as well as a image reformatting
system from the telescope focal plane to spectrograph entrance slit. While Galactic and ex-
tragalactic surveys have traditionally employed single ﬁbers to multiplex redshift and spectral
diagnostic measurements of stars, distant galaxies and quasars, more recently there has been
an additional focus on mapping resolved sources (nearby galaxies and Galactic nebulae) using
integral-ﬁeld spectroscopy (IFS). In general, ﬁber-fed IFS (IFUs; e.g., SparsePak[8], PPak[9],
VIRUS-P[1], VIRUS-W[2], MaNGA[10], and MEGARA[11]) are ﬂexible, cost-effective and
suitable for optical and near IR wavelengths. Fibers also lend themselves well to multi-object
IFS of distributed and/or extended sources contained in large (often many deg2) telescope ﬁelds
of view (e.g., SAMI[12] on the 4m AAT and MaNGA[13] on the 2.5m Sloan Telescope). Con-
sequently ﬁber-fed IFS remains an appealing approach along side other ﬂavours of IFS (e.g.,
image-slicing with SPHERE[14], MUSE[15] and KMOS[16] on VLT, or KCWI[17] on Keck).
Despite ﬁber optics being a popular and cost-effective mode of coupling telescopes to spec-
trographs, ﬁbers are well-known to degrade the input focal-ratio upon output. This focal ratio
degradation (FRD) via stepped index, multi-mode ﬁbers[18, 19, 20] affects the efﬁciency of

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
observation because it is in essence an injection of entropy into the information gathering sys-
tem. It is observed [21, 22] that the effect of FRD can be minimized by injecting a faster beam
into the ﬁber.

A contemporary measurement of this effect is illustrated in Figure 1 using a differential
reimaging system similar to [8, 10, 23]. The focal ratio degradation was measured for a
2-m length of 400µm diameter core step-index, broad-band ﬁber (MOLEX/Polymicro FBP
400:440:470) fed with a centered, reimaged near-ﬁeld spot of 100µm in diameter. The input
focal ratio was varied by changing the aperture of an intermediate pupil-stop. The output focal
ratio was measured at a radius covering 98% of the normalized encircled energy. The salient
feature of this measurement was that it was performed with a well-aligned inject beam, tele-
centric to within 0.1◦ in tip/tilt similar to that of [23]. The upper limit on the angular deviation
limits geometric FRD (gFRD) to no faster than f/286; over the range of injection speeds this is
inconsequential. While the left hand panel of Figure 1 shows the well-known non-linear ‘satu-
ration’ of the output beam speed, in the right panel we present the same measurements as a ratio
of out vs input solid angle. This has a simple, linear behavior with input numerical aperture
from which entropy gain due to ﬁber FRD can be easily estimated. The qualitative behavior
motivates why present-day ﬁber-coupled spectrographs tend to have faster collimators (see the
references above).

Fig 1: Focal ratio degradation by a 2m long 400µm diameter core ﬁber for various input focal
ratio measured at a normalized encircled energy of 98%. Measurements details are described in
the text. The ﬁgure depicts the effect of focal ratio degradation via ﬁber increases with slower
input beam in the left panel while the right panel shows the linear loss of solid angle on sky
with decreasing input numerical aperture.

It is also the case that for IFS using bare, densely packed circular ﬁbers, the ﬁll factor is typ-
ically only 60% [10] given the inherent geometry plus the minimum requirements for cladding
and mechanical buffer. Some gains can be had by removing the buffer and lightly fusing the
ﬁbers, but is technically challenging and comes at the cost of more FRD [24]. Consequently, it
is often desirable to couple ﬁbers to the telescope focal plane via lenslet arrays. One purpose
of lenslet coupling is to increase the ﬁll-factor of the ﬁber array. In principle, circular lenslets
with hexagonal packing or hexagonal lenslets with circular chromium coating can increase the
ﬁll-factor up to 90%. We consider this lenslet geometry in this paper. However, when coupling
lenslets to ﬁbers, a further challenge arises: The clear aperture in a micro-lens system falls
quickly compared to the available mechanical aperture with faster input beams from telescope

Thus in an effort to reduce FRD one would struggle to attain an acceptable ﬁll factor
on sky [25].

The aim of this study is to resolve the tension between the optimum input focal ratios for
lenslet and ﬁber optics. This is part of the broader question i.e. given a survey being planned,
either using an existing telescope or a new telescope, what would be the ideal telescope focal
ratio at the input of the microlens for a set of ﬁber input speed, ﬁber diameter and fabrica-
ble microlens properties. To do so we develop a generic analytical description of an image
transfer IFU optical model to optimize the telescope focal ratio within the constraints posed
by the microlens array fabrication. We assume the spectrograph design accommodates a fast
ﬁber output beam or, alternatively, uses additional microlenses at the output end of the ﬁber
to modulate the speed of the spectrograph collimator. We start in Section 2 by describing the
optical parameters of an image transfer IFU system and the parameter space available for opti-
mization given fabrication limitations and FRD. In Section 3 we describe the analytical model
to deﬁne the IFU optical parameters. Following sections discuss two distinct regimes where
on-axis aberrations are either dominated by diffraction or spherical aberration (SA) (Section
4) and the design choices that minimize light loss from aberrations in general (Section 5). We
conﬁrm the reliability of our model compared to ray-trace calculations in the non-diffraction-
limited regime in Section 5 as well. In Section 6 we describe the acceptable range of telescope
beam speed deﬁned by the fabrication limits. Section 7 summarizes our results and presents
our conclusions.

The result of our analysis calls for much slower telescope beams than developed for tele-
scopes optimized for bare-ﬁber feeds, such as HET and SALT, which are close to f/4. The
optimum telescope f-ratio we ﬁnd is closer to f/8, although in detail we will show this depends
on the ﬁber core diameter. The optimum f-ratio can be achieved on an existing telescope via
a macro-focal reducer or expander [27, 28, 29]. However, for a dedicated survey facility we
suggest optimizing the native telescope beam speed to minimize the total number of optical
elements [30, 31].

2 Design choices and constraints

2.1 Image transfer microlens system

We describe telecentric reimaging (or image-relay) microlens systems in this paper, and note
differences with pupil-transfer microlens systems below. The basic optical concept is to re-
image the focal plane on to the ﬁber cores through a set of two MLAs. Conceptually, the ﬁrst
MLA elements act as ﬁeld lenses while the second produces telecentric images. In practice,
to optimize image quality the optics deviate slightly from this idealized prescription [see for
example VIRUS2 design and Section 5 here][32]. A bi-convex MLA (BC) with appropriate
radius of curvature (RoC) and thickness creates a pupil at its exit surface, and the exit beam is
collimated for all ﬁeld points. A suitable gap (depending on the RoC of the second MLA) of
the BC and plano-convex MLA (PC) ensures a telecentric image at the ﬂat back surface of the
PC.

One of the free design parameter is the micro-image size at the input of the ﬁber. However,
in our previous study [26], we found that the micro-image diameter should be ∼97% of the
ﬁber core diameter in order to minimize ´etendue gain. Thus the ﬁber core diameter and micro-
image diameter are used interchangably in our analysis. To maximize grasp (area–solid-angle
product, or AΩ), the ideal micro-image diameter (dm) should be equal to the diameter of the
ﬁber core. However, due to ﬁber positioning and alignment issues dm needs to be smaller
than ﬁber core. Based on our own photo-lithographic work and comparison to commercially

3

available products we estimate current technology permits ﬁbers to be positioned within ±3 µm
RMS at any desired spacing[26].

Fig 2: Arrangement of a reimaging microlens array system that captures a part of the telescope
focal plane (da) and injects this into the ﬁber core. Key design parameters are: (a) Field 0:
Central ﬁeld point; (b) Field 1: Edge ﬁeld point; (c) da: Diameter of the input beam/Bi-convex
microlens (BC) clear aperture diameter; (d) rb: BC radius of curvature; (e) Db: BC thickness;
(f) d: Field 0 pupil diameter; (g) rp: plano-convex microlens (PC) radius of curvature; (h) Dp:
PC thickness; (i) DG: Air gap width between PC and BC; (j) dm: micro-image diameter/ﬁber
core diameter. Details about implemented microlens properties are discussed in [33].

Figure 2 illustrates a typical image-relay microlens system where telescope light is fed at
a focal ratio of ftel. This beam enters the bi-convex microlens with rb radius of curvature, Db
thickness, and da clear aperture. The thickness is deﬁned such that the beam forms its pupil
at the exit surface of the bi-convex microlens. The pupil is then focused to an image plane via
a plano-convex lens with rp radius of curvature and Dp thickness, sitting at a distance of DG
from the bi-convex lens. Dp and the beam diameter of the central ﬁeld deﬁnes the injected f-
ratio (fﬁb) into the ﬁber. Since the pupil is positioned at the exit surface of the bi-convex MLA,
one can deﬁne Dp as ng × rp/(ng - 1) so that the plano-convex microlens produce telecentric
micro-image at its planar back plane. Thus fﬁb and hence d and Dp deﬁne rp as well. On the
other hand, DG deﬁnes the MLA clear aperture diameter which in turn deﬁnes the sky sampling
size (via plate scale). We provide mathematical prescriptions of all these dependencies in the
following section 3 and more details about their derivation can be found in Appendix A.

2.2 Other microlens systems

Other microlens relay options include transfer of the image with a pupil onto the ﬁber en-
trance aperture. These so-called pupil-transfer systems have the advantage of requiring only
one MLA. In the simplest case using a single plano-convex MLA can be bonded directly to the
ﬁber to minimize reﬂection losses. Unfortunately, the pupil image onto the ﬁber is not telecen-
tric, leading to potentially signiﬁcant gFRD. Because the ﬁbers azimuthally scramble the input
signal, the non-telecentric feed cannot be corrected at the ﬁber output. It is straightforward to
correct for this by replacing the plano-convex MLA with something similar to the biconvex
MLA seen in Figure 2. Consequently pupil-transfer systems will have similar, but simpler de-
scriptions and constraints compared to the image-relay microlens systems. For this reason we
break out the constraints from both the bi-convex and plano-convex elements.

2.3 The merit of telecentric designs

While the re-imaging MLA system does not require additional air-glass surfaces to create a
telecentric design, it does place constraints on the lenslet design as we will see below. Further,
as noted above a telecentric pupil-imaging MLA system does require the addition of two air-
glass surfaces. Broadly, then it is worth considering whether imposing telecentric designs are

4

worth the cost in either design constraints or reﬂection losses. It is easiest to understand this in
the context of the pupil-imaging MLA system as follows.

As a general, qualitative statement for the telecentric pupil-imaging MLA case, given mod-
ern multi-layer anti-reﬂection coatings with broad-band performance achievable at 0.5-1% re-
ﬂection loss per air-glass surface over more than an octave in wavelength, the bar is not set very
high to gain by adding a two air-glass surfaces to eliminate gFRD.

Equation 3 of [34] can be used to compute the throughput loss due to gFRD. The fraction of
the light lost is given by L ∼ (0.4/B)(δ/u) where u is the angle of the marginal ray with respect
to the apex of the telecentric beam, δ is the angle of the marginal ray in the non-telecentric beam
with respect to the apex of the telecentric beam at the ﬁeld edge, and B is the fractional area
of the telescope primary mirror unobscured by the secondary mirror. The angles in a PC MLA
pupil-imaging system are illustrated in Figure 3. As two representative extrema, B has a value
of about 0.95 for the Gemini 8m telescope [35] and a value of about 0.7 for the Sloan 2.5m
telescope [36].

Fig 3: Ray schematic for the non-telecentric PC MLA pupil-imaging ﬁber system (left). The
telescope focal plane is formed at the location of the left-most vertical dashed line. Blue rays
trace the telescope pupil formed by the lenslet and also the ﬁber-input light cones at the edge
of the ﬁber. The chief ray of these cones is at an angle δ with respect to the telecentric angle.
Red rays (dashed) trace the input cone on the ﬁber face at the ﬁeld center, with a marginal ray
angle u. The geometric FRD loss based on [34] is shown at right for two telescope central
obstructions of 5% (black) and 30% (red), and two ﬁber input beam speeds (f/3 and f/5 in air,
bottom and top curves, respectively for each color). The lenslet and ﬁber index of refraction is
assumed to be matched at ng = 1.46.

Figure 3 shows that gFRD already leads to 10-30% throughput loss for ftel = 10 (depend-
ing on ﬁber injection speed and telescope central obstruction), and this increases rapidly for
faster telescopes. For any plausible telescope f-ratio, uncorrected gFRD losses never fall below
1%. This makes it clear that the telecentric design is preferable in all relevant cases for pupil-
imaging. For reference the GMOS IFU on Gemini [37] has a PC MLA lenslet system fed at
f/50 and injecting light into the ﬁbers at f/4. This system should have ∼5% thoughtput loss due
to gFRD.

The primary design parameters that have bearing on manufacturing limitations include the sur-
face curvature given by rp and rb, and the MLA thickness Db or Dp. Based on discussion with,
e.g. AµS1, we specify these fabrication-based limits for these parameters:

1. Maximum manufacturing limitation on the thickness (Db or Dp) of a microlens of 10 mm

and a minimum of 0.3/0.6 mm for PC and BC MLA respectively.

2. Fabrication limitation on the minimum radius of curvature of a microlens (rb or rp) of

0.02 mm.

The speciﬁc values for these parameters depend on the ﬁber input f-ratio fﬁb and micro-
image diameter dm as well as ftel. We also bound fﬁb and dm in our analysis, as follows, leaving
ftel unbounded. We constrain dm by the range of off-the-shelf multi-mode ﬁber size, with 50
µm as the smallest, and 600 µm as the largest that has seen practical use [38].

The range of fﬁb depends on the range of acceptable f-ratios for the spectrograph input
(the collimator). Traditional spectrograph designs have preferred slow collimators to increase
spectral resolution by decreasing the angular size of the slit while keeping the overall beam
size as small as possible. Slower input beams offer the added opportunity of demagniﬁcation
via fast camera optics to optimize matching to detector focal-planes. However, with ﬁber cou-
pling, FRD requires collimator speeds of f/5 to prevent signiﬁcant loss of etendue, as seen in
successful ﬁber-fed spectrograph designs (Hectoechelle[39]; GIRAFF[40]; upgraded WIYN
Bench[41]; SDSS/BOSS[42]).
Indeed, in more recent designs (e.g., DESI-f/3.7[5], M2FS-
f/3.4[43], WEAVE-f/3.1[44], MEGARA-f/3[11], PFS-f/2.8[3], DOTIFS-f/4.5[45]), collima-
tors are substantially faster to further minimize FRD. Spectrograph collimators are able to
accept f/2.5 with standard off the shelf optics while custom modiﬁcation may able to grasp
faster beams[46] approaching the ﬁber numerical aperture (typically f/2.2 for standard, high-
transmission broad-bandpass step-index ﬁber). We take 2.5 < fﬁb < 5 to be a reasonable
range for this parameterin order to keep FRD-induced entropy increase minimal to modest (see
Figure 1) in standard step-index ﬁber optics with numerical apertures of 0.22, most commonly
used in astronomical instrumentation.

In summary, then:

3. Fiber diameter dm between 50 to 600 µm.

4. Fiber input beam speed fﬁb between f/2.5 and f/5.

3 Analytic model of micro-lens optical parameters

In what follows it is useful to deﬁne the parameter η as the ratio of telescope to ﬁber focal-
ratios:

η ≡ ftel/fﬁb.

(1)

Appendix A then presents derivations of equations for all of the microlens design parameters
(surface curvatures rb, rp; thickness and spacing Db, DG, Dp) as a function of the telescope
input and ﬁber input focal-ratios, the size of the micro-image (dm) and the glass index ng. As
before, we equate the micro-image (dm) with the ﬁber core diameter.

For a ﬁber-microlens based IFU, the ﬁber radius can be chosen based on the camera and
detector size and usually ranges from 50 to 600 µm. Thus for each dm and fﬁb we should be

able to ﬁnd a ftel where the microlens radius of curvature is manufacturable while providing
adequate clear aperture as well as acceptable spot size even on the edge ﬁeld. At this point we
can vary the telescope f-ratio and the “aperture ratio” of the beam diameter at the PC array (d)
to the available aperture diameter (da). All these quantities are shown in the Figure 2.

4 Model Considerations: On-Axis Aberrations

The dominant on-axis aberrations in the micro-lens optical system are due to sphericity and
diffraction. Minimizing these as well as higher-order off-axis aberrations is desirable to max-
imize the encircled energy injected into a ﬁnite ﬁber core. While our analytical model can
deal with geometric aberrations (such as SA), the effort to minimize these depends on whether
they dominate. First we show that diffraction, even for micro-lens systems, remains a minimal
effect, which allows us to focus on the impact of minimizing SA on the lenslet design. These
calculations are done at an effective wavelength of 800 nm which is the logarithmic mid-point
for good ﬁber transmission (400-1600nm), and the worse-case limit for diffraction in visible-
wavelength systems.

To compare diffraction to SA we compare the impact on the radius enclosing 90% of the
encircled energy (EE90). In case of SA, the effect can be estimated by the transverse component
i.e. the radius of circle of least confusion (CoC) which can be roughly estimated (in radians) as
d3/(16r3), where d is the diameter of the entry aperture and r is the radius of curvature. Using
equations 3 and 7 for d and rp from Appendix A, we can express this as 1/(16fﬁb(ng −1))3. The
increase in edge ﬁeld EE90 due to diffraction is simply the ﬁrst minimum of the airy disk which
is measured as 1.22λ/d radians. For a system which converts an f/11 telescope beam into an f/3
ﬁber input within a microimage diameter of 100µm, the values of rp and d are 0.365 mm and
0.267 mm respectively. At 800 nm, the EE90 due to SA is more than 6 times greater than the
same for diffraction. Figure 4 shows the range of fﬁb and dm (note again: we are assuming dm
is the same as the ﬁber core diameter) where diffraction or SA dominates for different telescope
beam speed. It is interesting to note that the system tend to be more diffraction limited with
slower fﬁb for a given dm and ftel. Slower fﬁb would also (1) introduce additional FRD; (2)
reduce the grasp of the system, (3) reduce the radius of curvature of the optical elements; and
hence are not advisable to use. Thus for practical purpose we would concentrate on the range
of fﬁb, dm and ftel where SA dominates. Our f-ratio selection range also shows that beyond
ftel/7, most of our optimization space comes under systems that are mostly SA dominated.

5 Constraining the telescope focal-ratio: minimizing throughput loss due to aberrations

Given the dominance of SA over diffraction in most applications, we use our analytic model
to minimize the effect of spherical aberration on diminishing throughput. We then check if
this analytic model is accurate when considering higher-order aberrations, and conclude on the
limits our calculations place on the telescope focal-ratio.

To minimize the effects of light-loss from SA, we assume the thickness of microlens posi-
tions the CoC on the exit surface of the PC microlens (the ﬁber input core location). We can
estimate this PC thickness as the distance from the entry into MLA to the point of crossing the
optical axis by a marginal ray given the separation between the chief and the marginal ray and
lenslet radius of curvature is known. This is an analytical description of the longitudinal SA.
We have used this description to derive the relative constraint between PC MLA thickness and
radius of curvature for a given da and dm (hence η). Likewise for a given radius of CoC (de-
pending on how fast is the PC MLA) we can work out the losses for a ﬁber with a diameter of
dm. If the prescription on the PC MLA thickness and radius become too severe we can deﬁne

7

Fig 4: Range of ﬁber input beam speed and micro-image diameter (matched to the ﬁber core
diameter)

for which diffraction or spherical aberration dominates for different telescope beam speeds.
For practical purposes, the ﬁber core diameter will be close to the micro-image diameter.
Curves indicate the ratio of the airy disk ﬁrst minimum for a wavelength of 800 nm to the
circle of least confusion at values of unity (solid line), 1:3 (dashed; strongly
spherical-aberration limited) and 3:1 (dot-dash; strongly diffraction-limited). The aperture and
radius of curvature are computed using equations 3 and 7 from Appendix A. The blue shaded
region is the design target for ﬁber input f-ratio.

the trade-off in photon loss outside of dm if the CoC is not placed on the exit surface of the PC
MLA.

Appendix B and C describe the analytical model to deﬁne the longitudinal and transverse
SA (LSA and TSA). We found that analytical solutions to be cumbersome to deﬁne the location
and radius of CoC and hence we used the numerical approach. It may be noted that the result of
the analytical model is still important as an initial condition for performing optical simulation
to predict precise SA losses in speciﬁc IFU design studies.

We used d/2 as the marginal ray height and normalized with rp. Their ratio only depends
on fﬁb and ng. On the other hand, the normalized paraxial focus location is ng/(ng − 1) as
described in Appendix B. Given this, we compute the radius and location of CoC and marginal
focus for a grid of r2/rp (refer to Figure 13 in Appendix C) from 0 to 0.15 with 101 samples
while the position along the optical axis had 51 samples between 3 and 3.3 mm. The result is
tabulated in Table 1 which establishes the well known facts (47): (a) the radius of the circle of
least confusion, rcoc, is ∼ 0.25 times the beam radius at marginal ray height; (b) the distance
of CoC from paraxial focus is ∼ 0.75 times the distance of marginal focus from the paraxial
focus. The minor variation in TSA and LSA due to ﬁber input beam speed is negligible.

5.1 Accuracy of the analytic model

At this point it is important to note that there is also SA as well as off-axis aberration introduced
by the biconvex lens entry and exit surfaces. The analytical optimization of multi surface SA
is non-trivial and hence Zemax is used for this purpose. We used optical parameters from
our analytic model as initial conditions for the Zemax optimization and looked for how these

parameters change after detailed optimization. This optimization accounts for higher order
aberration such as coma, astigmatism, color etc. We used two conﬁgurations, one each in
regimes where SA or diffraction dominate (refer to Figure 4):

1. SA dominated regime: a f/11 telescope beam is relayed to a f/3.7 ﬁber input beam for a

micro-image diameter of 100µm.

2. Diffraction-limited regime: a f/7 telescope beam is relayed to a f/4 beam for a micro-

image diameter of 50 µm.

We use equations 2 to 16 for da and rb from Appendix A to predict the optical parameters
of the above mentioned conﬁgurations. The analytical model is built on the assumption that
the pupil should be formed at the exit surface of the BC MLA and the PC MLA is going to
form the CoC at its exit surface. We then use Zemax optimization to further optimize both the
conﬁgurations. Table 2 shows the comparison chart of the parameters and performance before
and after optimization. The design parameters change little in the SA-limited case (as we
might expect), but signiﬁcantly in the diffraction-limited regime. Nonetheless, we ﬁnd that the
analytical prediction produces optical performance similar to that of Zemax optimized design
within 4% for both the SA dominated regime and the diffraction dominated scenario based on
EE98 estimates. Since the ﬁber azimuthally scrambles the spatial information at its input, RMS

5.2 Limiting telescope beam speed in the presence of micro-lens aberrations

For a single spherical lens system (e.g., just the PC MLA), intuitively one would place the CoC
produced by the lens on the ﬁber input aperture, which is what our analytic model assumes.
For a compound lens system the situation is less obvious, however our Zemax optimization
indicates (Table 2) that placing the CoC produced by the PC MLA very close to the ﬁber
entrance aperture remains optimal when spherical aberration dominates over diffraction on-
axis.

We have used Zemax simulation to deﬁne the photon loss for a ﬁber capturing the CoC at
its entry surface for a range of telescope and ﬁber input f-ratio. The throughput (provided as
percentage of input photons) captured within the micro-image diameter of 100 µm for different
ftel and fﬁb is plotted in ﬁgure 5 including the effects of diffraction and off-axis aberrations. The
Figure shows that ftel of 6, 7, 7, 8 and 8 are optimum for fﬁb of 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5 respectively.
Although the plot is for 100 µm microimage diameter, the optimum telescope f-ratio of f/8 or
slower holds true for other micro-image diameters ranging from 50 to 600 µm. This discussion

can be used as a constraint on ftel coming from aberrations and can be summarized as the
following:

1. The faster the telescope beam, the larger the SA, as well as off-axis aberrations, hence

the larger the losses.

2. At fast telescope beams, a fast ﬁbre input beam helps to minimize the losses.

results are found for micro-image diameters ranging from 50 to 600 µm.

6 Constraining the telescope focal-ratio: microlens manufacturing limitations

Aberrations are not the only component that set a bound on the usable telescope focal ratio,
ftel. Several optical parameters, such as the radius of curvature and thickness of PC and BC
microlenses also pose constraints. In this section we describe the limiting conditions originating
from such manufacturing limitations for various micro-image diameters, dm, and ﬁber injection
speeds, fﬁb. These limits are computed using our analytical model in Section 3. We use openly
available information provided by AµS as a benchmark for fabrication.

6.1 Limits on ftel from lenslet radii of curvature

Figures 6 and 7 show the effect of fﬁb, and dm and ftel on the required radii of curvature (RoC)
for bi-convex (rb) and plano-convex (rp) MLAs, respectively. Clearly the fabrication limit on
rb does not constrain ftel for any ﬁber size and injection speed consider. Similarly, for On the
other hand, the fabrication limit on rp shows that for 50 µm ﬁber it is necessary for ftel ≥ 6 for
fﬁb = 5, but it does not provide any restriction for faster ﬁber injection speeds fﬁb < 4. For
larger ﬁbers (≥ 100µm) we can conclude broadly that there is no limiting ftel originating from
fabrication constraints on the MLA RoC.

11

a range of ﬁber input f-ratios (different colored lines deﬁned the bottom-right panel key) and
ﬁber diameters, assumed here to equal to dm. From top-left to bottom right panels correspond
to 50 µm to 600 µm core ﬁber. Black dashed lines denote 0.02 mm, the minimum possible
radius of curvature.

Fig 7: Dependence of plano-convex microlens (PC) radius of curvature (rp) on telescope f-ratio,
ﬁber diameter, and ﬁber input f-ratio as in Figure 6. Curves are deﬁned as in Figure 6.

6.2 Limits on ftel from MLA thickness

Apart from the microlens radius of curvature, the microlens thicknesses (dp and db) also con-
strain the telescope f-ratio range. Equations 5 and 10 in Appendix A show both dp and db
increase linearly with dm and hence the manufacturable thickness could pose constraints on

12

ftel. We have computed the dependence of ftel on MLA thickness for different ﬁber injection
speeds and micro-image diameters in Figures 8 and 9.

Fig 8: Dependence of bi-convex microlens required thickness (Db) on telescope f-ratio, ﬁber
diameter dm, and ﬁber input f-ratio (different colored lines deﬁned the bottom-right panel key).
The dash-dot and the dashed black lines represent the higher and the lower limit of thickness
respectively.

For fabrication thickness upper limits, a PC MLA can have arbitrarily large thickness by
bonding it to a ﬂat substrate. However, for the BC MLA, the registration error between curved
faces increases with thickness and hence a manufacturing limit of 10 mm is used by the vendors.
It should be noted that with additional effort of alignment and bonding, two PC MLAs and
arbitrarily thick glass plate can be used to eliminate the thickness upper limit. Consequently
the BC MLA thickness upper limit is taken to be a soft limit. In general MLA thickness upper
limits tend to drive the telescope speed to be faster. As can be seen in Figures 8 and 9, a 10 mm
thickness upper limit, the bi-convex MLA sets ftel ≤ 7(11) for fﬁb = 2.5(5), respectively, for
600 µm ﬁbers. For smaller ﬁbers with diameter ≤ 100 µm the thickness does not limit the
ftel within the range of telescope focal ratios that is being considered. The PC MLA thickness
imposes no limits on ftel as it can be increased arbitrarily.

For fabrication thickness lower limits, the manufacturer has to ensure that the array is ﬂat
and thus it is difﬁcult to reduce lenslet thickness below 0.3 and 0.6 mm for PC and BC MLA
respectively. In general MLA thickness lower limits tend to drive the telescope speed to be
slower. As can be seen in Figures 8 and 9, the minimum thickness forces ftel ≥ 9(11) for
50 µm ﬁber for fﬁb = 2.5(5) but does not limit ﬁbers with ≥ 400µm cores.

6.3 Summary of limitations on ftel

Table 3 compiles all the limitations on ftel from different criteria presented in this and the
previous section (4). In the ﬁnal columns we take the most conservative option as our ﬁnal
limit. In most cases the lower limit is set by ‘SA,’ which includes the impact of all aberrations
on EE98. This means that this limit is unaffected by any potential future improvements in
fabrication limits for spherical lenslet ﬁgures. Aspherics may alter this picture, and are worthy

13

Fig 9: Dependence of plano-convex microlens required thickness Dp on telescope f-ratio, ﬁber
diameter dm, and ﬁber input f-ratio (different colored lines deﬁned the bottom-right panel key).
The dashed black lines represent the thickness lower limit; the upper limit is at the upper limit
of the plotting range.

of future consideration. In constrast, the upper limit on ftel is constrained solely by the BC
MLA thickness upper limit. As described above, this upper limit may be surmountable and as
such there is no hard upper limit on the telescope beam speed.

It is evident and intuitive that faster telescope beams require the optical dimensions of the
microlens arrays to be smaller and hence lossier for ﬁber-coupling due to increased aberrations.
Less intuitive is the fact that for larger ﬁber core diameter, the limiting telescope f-ratio gets
faster. The effect is most pronounced going from the diffraction-limited to SA dominated
regimes (in the range 50 µm < dm < 100 µm). Indeed, in the SA dominated regime the
limiting telescope f-ratio is constant for a given ﬁber input beam speed, and only changes by
33% for a factor of two change in ﬁber injection speed.

We provide a visual summary of the Table 3 in Figure 10 where the ﬁnal range of acceptable
telescope focal ratios are plotted against ﬁber diameter for three ﬁber input beam speeds. In
terms of conserving grasp, it is important to note that due to FRD it is preferable to use ﬁber
injection speeds closer to fﬁb = 3 than fﬁb = 5. Overall, however, it is important to keep in
mind that the grasp (A Ω) does not depend on the telescope focal-ratio but rather only on the
square of the telescope diameter Dtel (collecting area, A), and the product of dm/(Dtel × fﬁb)
(solid angle, Ω). While the solid angle can be re-written as da/(Dtel × ftel), fundamentally the
grasp is driven by the telescope size and the considerations of the spectrograph injection speed
and aperture, hence the ﬁber size dm and the ﬁber injection speed.

As a common practice in slit spectroscopy, astronomers often need to modulate the slit
width at ﬁxed focal ratio to optimize the resolution-throughput product of their observations
given the requirements of the scientiﬁc program, the observing conditions, and the angular
scale of their sources. For ﬁber spectroscopy, including lenslet-coupled IFUs, this is equivalent
to changing the ﬁber core diameter at ﬁxed focal ratio. In this context Figure 10 shows that for
ﬁber sizes smaller than 100 µm there is a limited range in ﬁber size that can be accommodated

Table 3: Summary of limits on telescope beam speed for all conﬁgurations of varying micro-
image diameter at the ﬁber input (dm) and ﬁber input beam speed (fﬁb). L and U denotes lower
and upper limits of telescope beam speed respectively while no limits are represented with
dash. BC and PC represents bi-convex and plano-convex microlens while Abr and RoC stands
for optical aberrations and radius of curvature, respectively. All constraints are from Section 6
except for optical aberrations (Section 4)

at ﬁxed telescope and ﬁber injection speeds. Conversely, for ﬁber core diameters of 100 µm and
larger lenslet coupling can be achieved with a ﬁxed telescope focal ratio of f/8 for ﬁber injection
at f/3 (or f/9 to f/10 for ﬁber injection at f/4, etc.). Similarly, for ﬁber cores > 100 µm, there
is a broader range of ﬁber injection speeds at a ﬁxed telescope focal ratio in the range of 8 to
10, with f/8 providing the largest range of ﬁber injection speeds. On this basis we suggest f/8
as the optimum telescope f-ratio in terms lenslet-ﬁber coupling ﬂexibility for ﬁbers with core
sizes ≥ 100 µm. The use of smaller ﬁbers may apply to small telescopes (below 4m) where the
science requires matching of the ﬁber core to the seeing disk. While Figure 10 indicates that
telescope focal ratios faster than f/8 would allow for faster injection speeds for larger ﬁbers,
the faster telescope focal ratios will limit the dynamic range in ﬁber core size over which this
is possible.

7 Summary

In this paper we presented the trade-offs in optical design of micro-lens reimaging systems
constrained to link telescope focal planes to ﬁber optics. Speciﬁcally, we have examined the
constraints on telescope focal ratio for a realistic range of ﬁber core diameters and ﬁber injec-
tion speeds given (i) manufacturing limitations on micro-lens arrays and (ii) the need to have
high-efﬁciency coupling. For this trade study we have developed an analytical model from
ﬁrst principals and two basic conditions: (a) the BC MLA should produce the pupil at its exit
surface; (b) the image produced by the PC MLA must be telecentric to eliminate geometric
FRD. We evaluate the efﬁcacy of the model by considering the salient performance parameter
of ﬁbers acting as photon buckets: the percentage of energy enclosed with the ﬁber core by
the compound lenslet system. We adopt this metric rather than RMS spot radius since ﬁbers
scramble the spatial information. In this regard the performance of the model-predicted optical
design matches within 4% of optimized models using ray-trace software. We have also char-
acterized in detail the different regimes in which these MLA systems are dominated (on axis)
by diffraction versus SA. While the detailed micro-lens parameters (thickness, spacing, radius
of curvature) are more accurately prescribed by our analytic model in the SA limited regime,
in all cases, the model designs provide better than 98% throughput apart from Fresnel losses at
the glass-air boundaries in all regimes.

We computed the overall upper and lower limits on telescope focal ratio set by the fabrica-
tion limit of BC and PC MLA as well as light-losses from SA and off-axis aberrations. Lower
limits on ftel are set by considering light-losses into the ﬁber, while upper limits are set by the
BC MLA thickness. This upper limit of ftel may be relaxed via additional effort in replacing a
monolithic BC MLA with two back-facing PC MLAs, possibly separated by a ﬂat glass plate.

considered (50 µm) to 100 µm, which corresponds to the transition between diffraction to SA
dominated regimes. For ﬁbers larger than 100 µm the limiting telescope focal-ratio is given
roughly by ftel,lower = 0.8fﬁb + 4 and ftel,upper = 2fﬁb + 3. For the smallest 50 µm ﬁbers
ftel,lower = 1.5fﬁb + 4, with no upper limit. The case for the 100 µm ﬁber core is intermediate
to these two limiting cases.

For a spectrograph fed directly by ﬁbers injected with 3 < fﬁb < 5, we ﬁnd that an f/8
telescope would support ﬁber diameters from 100 to 500 µm within the optimized range. This
enables a wide range of spatial and spectral resolution for survey optimization with the same
telescope and spectrograph hardware. Finally we comment that while it is always preferable
to reduce the number of optical elements when possible, the native telescope focal ratio can
often be reimaged by a suitable focal reducer or expander. On the basis of our analysis we
suggest such additional optics should be designed, for most applications, to deliver a focal
surface feeding micro-lens arrays at f/8. MLA designs with additional, or aspheric surfaces
may alter these conclusions, but such augmentation incurs additional cost and complexity in
design, fabrication and assembly.

Appendix A: Derivation of model parameters

Here we calculate the relationships between the critical MLA parameters (surface curvature,
thickness and spacing) as a function of the telescope input and ﬁber input focal-ratios and the
size of the micro-image, which again we take to be just slightly under-sized with respect to the
ﬁber core diameter. The ﬁber input f-ratio fﬁb is deﬁned in the air while Dp and d deﬁnes the
f-ratio in glass. Hence fﬁb is usually multiplied with refractive index of glass (ng) at the system
wavelength.

A.1 Optical diameters

Relevant diameters can be computed by using the conservation of entropy (grasp) to relate the
bi-convex MLA clear aperture da then can be formulated as a function of micro-image diameter
dm:

da =

= dm η.

)

(2)

ftel
( fﬁb
dm

From this, the beam diameter for a single ﬁeld point at the input of the Plano-convex MLA
(PC) is d ≤ da − dm. This follows by construction in Figure 2 due to the constraints that (i) the
PC MLA diameter cannot not exceed that of the BC MLA diameter, and (ii) the telecentricity
requirement stipulates the principle ray for the edge ﬁeld-point must fall at a height of dm/2
from the optical axis while the distance between the marginal and principle ray is d/2. Hence
d/2 + dm/2 has to be equal to da/2, namely the clear aperture diameter of the PC and BC lenslets.
Although d can be less than da − dm, this reduces rp. Hence maximizing d helps minimize SA,
so we take d = da − dm. This condition for d can be rewritten with equation 2 as

d = dm (η − 1).

(3)

17

A.2 PC MLA thickness and radius of curvature

From ﬁber input focal ratio, one can deduce that the plano-convex lens thickness is simply:

Note that since f-ratio is determined in air, refractive index has to be multiplied to get the

f-ratio in the glass. This can be rewritten using equation 3 as:

fﬁb ng =

Dp
d

.

(4)

Using the lens makers equation for plano convex lens with rp is the radius curvature of the

curved surface and the other side is ﬂat, we can state that,

Dp = dmngfﬁb (η − 1).

(5)

1
Dp/ng

= (ng − 1)(

1
rp

−

1
∞

).

(6)

Again note the use of ng as a dividing factor as the focal length is usually deﬁned in air but in
our case the focus is the ﬂat back plane of the MLA. Hence the thickness of PC lenslets should
in air focal length multiplied by the refractive index of the glass. Hence, the plano-convex
MLA (PC) radius of curvature can then be written as:

rp = Dp(ng − 1)/ng = dmfﬁb(ng − 1)(η − 1).

A.3 MLA spacing

Again, using the lens makers equation for plano convex lens we can ﬁnd that,

1
DG

= (ng − 1)(

1
rp

−

1

).

(7)

(8)

Since DG is deﬁned in air we don’t need to include ng. Hence the gap between the bi-convex

and plano-convex MLA can be derived as

DG = rp/(ng − 1) = dmfﬁb (η − 1).

A.4 BC MLA thickness and radius of curvature

Similar to plano-convex MLA, the bi-convex MLA (BC) thickness can be derived as:

Db = ngdftel = dmngftel (η − 1).

(9)

(10)

The bi-convex MLA (BC) radius of curvature can be derived from the path of chief ray
of the edge ﬁeld inside the BC MLA as shown in Figure 11, as follows. From Snell’s law,
sin θ = ng sin β, and from Figure 11 we have θ = α + β.

18

Fig 11: Propagation path of edge ﬁeld chief ray inside the bi-convex lenslet.

From this, we can easily derive

tan β =

while from the right angle triangle we can deﬁne sin α as

and similarly,

sin α ≈

which we can combine to write:

Appendix B: Refraction on the spherical surface: Dependence of microlens thickness on
beam diameter.

Here we deﬁne the PC MLA thickness, f (sag plus ﬂat thickness), with radius of curvature R,
such that the ray of an object at inﬁnity at height r crosses the optical axis at the exit surface.
Due to SA, this thickness depends on height. We have deﬁned the thickness for an object at
inﬁnity and in line with our requirement of treating the PC MLA which is the imaging lens
in our system. This generic description of MLA thickness will help us deﬁne the PC lenslet
parameters requried to locate the CoC on the PC MLA exit surface in the next subsection. Using
the derivation from Hecht[48] for an object at a distance So in front of the MLA, illustrated in
Figure 12, their equation 5.4, given here as:

can be rewritten for an object at inﬁnity (So = lo = ∞, Si = f, n1 = 1 and n2 = ng):

which has the expected paraxial approximation (r/R(cid:28)1) of f = R(ng/(ng−1). The dependence
of the microlens thickness f on (r, R, ng) is simply the manifestation of SA on a collimated
beam.

Appendix C: Effect of spherical aberration on microlens focal length: Longitudinal and
Transverse spherical aberration

The longitudinal SA (LSA) is deﬁned by the distance between paraxial focus and the focus of
the marginal ray while the transverse SA (TSA) is the marginal ray height at the paraxial focus.

20

However, to minimize the effect of SA the location and radius of circle of least confusion
(CoC) is important to understand. The location would directly deﬁne the thickness of the
PC lenslet while the CoC radius would impose condition on the lenslet properties in order to
restrict the micro-image to form within the ﬁber core to reduce photon loss at the MLA-ﬁber
junction. Increasing the ﬁber core diameter arbitrarily to engulf entire micro-image would lead
to increase in optical entropy which can be equated to loss of observation time.

Now having the analytical description of thickness of PC lenslet in our arsenal, we will
describe the radius and position of circle of least confusion and what should be the strategy for
minimizing the radius. In ﬁgure 13 we deﬁne a plano-convex microlens of radius of curvature
R fed with a collimated beam. The height of the ray from the optical axis is r; α and β are the
angles of incidence and refraction at the input surface, respectively; q and δ are the distances
of the crossing of optical axis inside the microlens and chief ray entry point to the arbitrary
ray entry point respectively. Sufﬁxes 1 and 2 denote angles and dimensions associated with
marginal and paraxial ray, respectively. The radius of the circle of least confusion (CoC) is
deﬁned as r3 while the distance from circle of least confusion from the marginal ray focus is γ.

It is easy to ﬁnd that δ2 = R − (cid:112)R2 − r2

One can differentiate equation 23 and ﬁnd the maxima to identify the location of the CoC.
However, this analytical approach is quite cumbersome and hence it is better to solve the prob-
lem numerically.
