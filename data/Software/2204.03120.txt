Abstract— The postoperative range of motion is one of 
the  crucial  factors  indicating  the  outcome  of  Total  Knee 
Arthroplasty (TKA). Although the correlation between range 
of  knee  flexion  and  posterior  condylar  offset  (PCO)  is 
its 
controversial 
importance on evaluation of TKA. Due to limitations on PCO 
measurement,  two  novel  parameters,  posterior  condylar 
offset  ratio  (PCOR)  and  anterior  condylar  offset  ratio 
(ACOR),  were  introduced.  Nowadays,  the  calculation  of 
PCOR  and  ACOR  on  plain  lateral  radiographs  is  done 
manually  by  orthopedic  surgeons.  In  this  regard,  we 
developed  a  software,  AutoCOR,  to  calculate  PCOR  and 
ACOR  autonomously,  utilizing  unsupervised  machine 
learning  algorithm  (k-means  clustering)  and  digital  image 
processing techniques. The software AutoCOR is capable 
of  detecting 
the  anterior/posterior  edge  points  and 
anterior/posterior  cortex  of  the  femoral  shaft  on  true 
postoperative lateral conventional radiographs. To test the 
algorithm,  50  postoperative  true  lateral  radiographs  from 
Istanbul  Kosuyolu  Medipol  Hospital  Database  were  used 
(32  patients).  The  mean  PCOR  was  0.984  (SD  0.235)  in 
software  results  and  0.972  (SD  0.164)  in  ground  truth 
values. It shows strong and significant correlation between 
software  and  ground  truth  values  (Pearson  r=0.845 
p<0.0001).    The  mean  ACOR  was  0.107  (SD  0.092)  in 
software  results  and  0.107  (SD  0.070)  in  ground  truth 
values.  It  shows  moderate  and  significant  correlation 
between  software  and  ground  truth  values  (Spearman’s 
rs=0.519  p=0.0001412).  We  suggest  that  AutoCOR  is  a 
useful tool that can be used in clinical practice.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

    Total  Knee  Arthroplasty  (TKA)  is  a  surgical  operation 
applied to the patients who are in a severe stage of osteoarthritis. 
The operation is to improve their functional status on walking 
and enhance their ability to move [1].  The range of knee flexion 
is one of the most significant outcome determinants of the Total 
Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). The maximum flexion smaller than 
70  degrees  is  associated  with  poor  ability  to  walk,  whereas 
maximum flexion greater than 110 degrees is associated with 

good  ability  to  walk  [2].  In  the  literature,  the  association 
between  range  of  knee  flexion  and  posterior  condylar  offset 
(PCO) remains controversial  [2-4]. Several studies concluded 
on  a  strong  correlation  [2,3],  whereas  a  study  concluded  no 
correlation  [4].  This  controversy  provides  a  research  area 
needed  to  be  further  examined  in  detail.  Moreover,  PCO  is 
among the parameters defined as surgically modifiable-factors. 
Proper assessment in preoperative period and evaluation of this 
parameter  in  postoperative  period  are  significant  in  clinical 
practice [5].  

   The  PCO  was  initially  defined  by  Bellemans  et  al.  as 
“maximal  thickness  of  the  posterior  condyle  projecting 
posteriorly to the tangent of the posterior cortex of the femoral 
shaft on a true lateral radiograph” [3]. The measurement of PCO 
requires  an  accurate  knowledge  of  the  specific  magnification 
factor  on  that  radiograph.  The  improper  standardization  of 
radiographs in terms of magnification factor, leads to inaccurate 
PCO  measurements.  The  errors  are  likely  to  originate  from 
uncertain  magnification  factors  and  absence  of  a  reference 
measurement [6]. In this regard, two novel parameters, known 
as posterior condylar offset ratio (PCOR) and anterior condylar 
offset ratio (ACOR), were defined as quantifiable ratios, which 
do  not  depend  on  the  magnification  factor  or  reference 
measurement  [6,7].  A.  Malviya  et  al.  defines  the  usage  of 
PCOR  instead  of  PCO  as  advantage  due  to  no  magnification 
correction issue [5]. 

   PCOR  was  defined  by  P.  Johal  et  al.  as  “the  maximal 
thickness  of  the  posterior  condyle  projecting  posteriorly  to  a 
straight  line  drawn  as  the  extension  of  the  posterior  femoral 
shaft cortex, divided by the maximal thickness of the posterior 
condyle  projecting  posterior  to  a  straight  line  drawn  as  the 
extension of the anterior femoral shaft cortex on a true lateral 
radiograph of the distal quarter of the femur'' [8]. C.E.H. Scott 
et  al.  studied  both  PCOR  and  ACOR.  PCOR  was  defined  as 
PCO divided by femoral diameter [5,7]. ACOR was defined as 
ACO divided by femoral diameter [7]. The reference values for 
PCOR and ACOR were introduced as a result of several cohort 
studies. According to the study conducted by P. Johal et al. on

twenty  postoperative  radiographs,  the  mean  PCOR  was 
calculated as 0.47 [8]. 

II.  MATERIALS AND METHODS 

   The  measurement/calculation  of  these  parameters,  PCO, 
ACO, PCOR and  ACOR, is  not commonly performed by  the 
orthopedic  surgeons,  only  for  research  purposes.  The 
prevalence of obtaining those parameters for TKA-patients is 
low due to the manual process requiring both time and attention. 
To extend the usage of these parameters in clinical settings, we 
developed  a  software,  AutoCOR,  which  can  calculate  PCOR 
and ACOR and visualize the landmarks on plain postoperative 
lateral knee radiographs within a second. AutoCOR integrates 
the  unsupervised  machine 
learning  algorithm  (k-means 
clustering)  and  image  processing  techniques  (edge  detection) 
for  this  purpose.  The  basic  mechanism  of  action  is  rooted  in 
landmark detection. 

When the current literature is examined, the anatomical  angle 
measurement  studies  were  mainly  concentrated  on  landmark 
detection  by  deep  learning.  Several  studies  regarding  the 
determination  of  anatomical  points  on  X-ray  images  by 
convolutional  neural  network  method  exist.  One  study 
determines  19  cephalometric  landmarks  from  skeletal  X-ray 
images.  The  model  has  two  stages:  ROI  extraction  and 
landmark detection. First, the skeletal X-ray images are divided 
into  patches  around  the  potential  anatomical  points.  These 
potential/coarse  anatomical  points  are  found  by 
image 
registration  method.  Intensity-based  registration  method  with 
mean squared error is applied. The pre-trained ResNet50 model 
is used for the detection of 19 landmarks on those ROI patches 
[9].  Another  study  is  performed  to  determine  3  anatomical 
points on lower limb X-ray images to measure hip-knee-ankle 
(HKA)  angle.  The  segmentation  by  U-Net  algorithm  is 
performed in this study. Three areas, ankle, knee and hip joints, 
are segmented on the X-ray. The center of three areas is found 
and the HKA angle is measured [10]. 

In another study, different angles are calculated by detecting 9 
anatomical points on lower limb X- rays. The model consists of 
two stages. In the first stage, first-order detection is applied to 
find  the  coarse  locations  of  each  point.  Then,  around  those 
coarse locations, ROI patches are formed. The model is trained 
by those ROI patches [11]. 

To sum up the literature review, several studies regarding the 
landmark detection on lower extremity plain radiographs exist 
and  generally  utilized  Deep  Convolutional  Neural  Network 
(CNN).  However,  no  study  on  autonomous  measurement  of 
PCOR and ACOR by using image processing, machine learning 
or deep learning exits in the literature. This situation highlights 
the necessity of artificial intelligence in this era. 

This study is approved by the Ethics Review Committee of 

Istanbul Medipol University. 

2.1 Dataset 

The  selection  of  imaging  modality  for  the  measurement 
process in the project is based on the information obtained from 
the 
literature  review  and  current  clinical  applications. 
Conventional radiographs are the most commonly used imaging 
method. Computed tomography (CT) or MRI can be used when 
necessary, although not frequently. This is due to the patient's 
exposure  to  high  doses  of  ionized  radiation  on  CT  imaging. 
they  are  not  routinely  used  methods  [12]. 
Therefore, 
Conventional radiography was chosen as the primary modality 
in the project as a result of its prevalence in the literature and in 
the  clinical  settings.  Although  conventional  radiographs  are 
commonly used in preoperative and postoperative periods for 
TKA patients, disadvantage of this modality is stated as lack of 
cartilage tissue of knee joint on plain radiographs. This property 
distorts  appropriate  preoperative  measurement/calculation  of 
offset  and  offset  ratio  [8].  In  this  manner  for  preoperative 
measurement,  MRI  modality  appears  to  give  more  accurate 
results, due to its capability to visualize the soft tissue besides 
the bones.  

50  true  postoperative  lateral  knee  X-ray  images  were 
obtained  from  the  database  PUSULA  of  Istanbul  Koşuyolu 
Medipol  Hospital.  The  images  of  32  patients  (26  females,  6 
males), who underwent TKA in this hospital between 2017 and 
2020, were utilized. The images were selected by a trauma and 
orthopedic  surgeon  with  14-year  of  experience.  The  true 
radiographs  were  downloaded  in  JPEG  format.  The  size  of 
images is 1378 x 672 px. 

2.2 Image Preprocessing 

The original images are cropped between 500 to 900 pixels 
in  width  and  224  to  448  pixels  in  height.  Thus,  the  size  of 
region-of-interest (ROI) patches are determined as 400 x 224 
px (Figure-1). ROI patches contain only the knee-joint region 
with femoral condyles. ROI images are processed further with 
cv2.threshold() 
cv2.cvtColor() 
cv2.bilateralFilter(), 
respectively  [13].  The  aim  of  preprocessing  is  to  make  the 
femoral component prominent on the ROI patch.  

and 

  a)  cv2.bilateralFilter(): To  apply  the  threshold  method, 
the  image  needs  to  be  blurred.  There  are  several  blurring 
methods  in  the  OpenCV  library.  The  selection  of  the 
bilateralFilter()  method 
its  distinct  blurring 
is  due

edge-preservation,  noise-removal  and  smoothing.  The  d 
(diameter) is set to 30, sigmaColor and sigmaSpace are set to 
100.  These  parameters  are  adjusted  experimentally  to  obtain 
the sharp edges and less noise.

2.3 Image Segmentation by K-means Clustering 
The  format of  thresholded image  is converted to  RGB and 
image matrix is reshaped to (-1,3). K-means Clustering, which 
is  an  unsupervised  machine  learning  algorithm,  is  utilized  to 
segment the image in terms of color basis [14]. The main aim is 
to  extract  the  femoral  and  tibial  components  from  their 
surroundings.  The

is 

The number of clusters is determined as 4, and the brightness 
of the components are the highest when compared with other 
tissues. The colors of 4 clusters are listed and the brightest one 
is selected. Brightest cluster is the  one  which  has the biggest 
decimal code indicating its color. In other words, the decimal 
value closest to (255,255,255) among these 4 clusters belongs 
to the femoral and tibial component. The model is mainly built 
on the basis of this rationale. 

The  contours  around  the  components  are  found  on  the 
masked  image,  which  contains  only  the  brightest  cluster  as 
stated above. The method cv2.findContours() is used to find the 
edges with cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL technique. This technique 
is  preferred  over  other  ones,  as  it  can  detect  the  largest  and 
comprehensive  contours,  avoiding  subsets.  The  extraction  of 
the femoral component is mediated by a snippet of code. The 
algorithm is based on the comparison of contour areas, since the 
femoral component has the largest area. 

2.5  Detection  of  Anterior  and  Posterior  Cortex  of 

Femoral Shaft 

The original image is sliced between left edge point to right 
edge  point  with  50-pixel  extension  to  both  sides  in  terms  of 
width. It is sliced down to the level of the edge point in terms 
of height. By this way, a new ROI patch, containing only the 
femoral  shaft,  is  created.  In  order  to  detect  the  anterior  and 
posterior cortex of the femoral shaft, two lines extending from 
these cortexes are found. 2 points residing on the anterior cortex 
line  and  2  points  residing  on  the  posterior  cortex  line  are 
selected  at  the  level  of  100  px  and  140  px  in  height.  The 
determination  of  these  levels  are  under  the  guidance  of  an 
orthopedic  surgeon.  At  the  level  of  100  and  140,  the  points 
intersecting with the cortex of the shaft are detected. 

To  simplify  the  landmark  detection  process,  the  image  is 
processed with Canny Edge Detection, following the bilateral 
filtering and conversion into grayscale format. Thus, an image 
containing only the anterior and posterior cortex of the shaft is 
created. Afterwards, in total 4 points are selected at the 100 and 
140  px  level.  The  two  corresponding  lines  are  formed  by 
utilizing these landmarks. The image  processing  steps can be 
observed below (Fig.1). 

2.6  Measurement  of  Femoral  Diameter,  Anterior  and 

Posterior Condylar Offset 

The  outcomes  of  Steps  2.4  and  2.5 provide  the  anatomical 
landmarks  which  are  needed  to  measure  Femoral  Diameter, 
ACO  and  PCO.  The  measurement  of  these  parameters  are 
mediated  by  using  the  np.linalg.norm()  function  of  Numpy 
Library [15]. The Equation-1 represents the formula to calculate 
the perpendicular distance between a point and a line. The line 
equations corresponding to cortexes of the shaft are calculated 
by using the Line () method of Sympy Library [16].  

 2.4  Detection  of  Anterior and  Posterior  Edge  Points  of 

(Equation-1) 

Femoral Component 

The extraction of the femoral component allows detection of 
the edge points of the component on the anterior and posterior 
side. The  coordinates are sorted in ascending and descending 
order of width (x-axis). The height is sorted in descending order 
(y-axis). The leftmost and rightmost points are the first element 
of these sorted lists. Since the coordinates of the edge points are 
compatible  with  the  ROI  patch,  they  are  re-calculated  to  be 
visualized  on  the  original  image.  In  this  manner,  the  amount 
slicing  is  added  to  coordinates  appropriately.  The  original 
image was sliced between 500 to 900 px in width and 224 to 
448  px  in  height.  The  500  is  added  to  x  values  of  the  edge 
points, 224 is added to y values of edge points.

ACO  is  the  perpendicular  distance  between  anterior  edge 
point  and  anterior  cortex  of  the  femoral  shaft.  PCO  is  the

and posterior cortex of femoral shaft. The femoral diameter is 
the perpendicular distance between two cortexes. According to 
these  definitions,

2.7  Calculation  of  Anterior  and  Posterior  Condylar 

III.  RESULTS 

Offset Ratio 

The calculation of the ACOR and PCOR is not dependent on 
the magnification factor. Thus, it can give robust and accurate 
results. As stated in Step 2.5, linalg.norm() function of Numpy 
Library and Line() method of SymPy Library are utilized. The 
important  aspect  of  the  proposed  model  is  that  both  left  and 
right lateral knee X-rays can be given without prior selection of 
the X-ray type. The model works in the same manner for both 
left and right knees. The results are analyzed and specification 
of the limb as left or right knee is done by the software itself. 
According 
the  results  are  given 
appropriately under the correct classes.

2.8 Analysis of the software AutoCOR 

The ground truth ACOR and PCOR values calculated by an 
orthopedic surgeon were compared with the model outputs. The 
the 
mean,  standard  deviation,  Bland-Altman  Plot  are 
parameters used to evaluate the performance of the AutoCOR. 

2.9 Statistical Analysis of Model 

The normality test (The Shapiro-Wilk Test) was applied to 
assess the distribution of the results before correlation test. The 
Pearson  correlation  coefficient  test  was  applied  between  the 
model  output  and  ground  truth  values  of  both  ACOR  and 
PCOR. 

The model outputs and the manually labeled X-rays which are 
used as ground truth values can be observed above (Figure-2). 
The  first  row  contains  the  model  output  images.  In  total  6 
anatomical points were selected to measure PCOR and ACOR 
in  an  autonomous  manner.  The  proposed  model  is  basically 
performing a landmark detection. 2 points reside on the anterior 
cortex and 2 points reside on the posterior cortex of the femoral 
shaft.  These  4  points  constitute  the  tangent  lines  of  cortexes. 
Remaining  2  points  reside  on  the  anterior  and  posterior  edge 
points  of  the  femoral  component.  An  illustration  of  usage  of 
these  six  points  and  2  offset  ratios  can  be  observed  below 
(Figure-3). As it can be seen from the results, the landmarks are 
predicted successfully. 

3.1 Normality Tests and Statistical Analysis  

The statistical analysis was performed on Microsoft® Excel® 
2016 MSO (version 16.0.4266.1001) and XLSTAT® software 
(version  2022.1.2.1283,  Addinsoft,  New  York).  The  ground 
truth and model outputs were tested in terms of normality. The 
Shapiro-Wilk  Test  was  used  for  PCOR  and  ACOR  values. 
Significance level was adjusted to 0.05 (5%). The P-P and Q-Q 
plots were generated for the visualization purpose (Fig.4). The 
minimum,  maximum,  mean  and  standard  deviation  for  each 
class was calculated (Table-1). 

Distribution  of  the  data  was  needed  to  be  evaluated  before 
assessing the correlation between ground truth and model

results.  The  mean  (SD)  results  for  PCOR  model-data  and 
ground  truth-data  are  0.984  (0.235)  and  0.972  (0.164), 
respectively. The mean (SD) results for ACOR model-data and 
ground  truth-data  are  0.107  (0.092)  and  0.107  (0.070), 
respectively.  

The Shapiro-Wilk Test resulted in “Normal Distribution” for 
both model and true PCOR data (W=0.982 p=0.635 - W=0.973 
p=0.294).  The  Shapiro-Wilk  Test  resulted  in  “Not  Normal 
Distribution”  for  both  model  and  true  ACOR  data  (W=0.825 
p=<0.0001 - W=0.952 p=0.042).  

The null hypothesis states a normal distribution, whereas the 
alternative  hypothesis  states  that  the  variable  from  which  the 
sample  was  extracted,  does  not  follow  a  normal  distribution. 
The  p-value  which  is  greater  than  the  significance  level 
alpha=0.05 indicates that one cannot reject the null hypothesis 
H0. Thus, indicates a normal distribution. The p-value which is 
smaller than the significance level alpha=0.05 indicates that one 
should reject the null hypothesis H0, and accept the alternative 
hypothesis  Ha.  In  this  manner,  ACOR  data  is  not  distributed 
normally, and Pearson correlation tests cannot be applied. 

3.2 Correlation Tests  

For PCOR; Pearson Correlation Coefficient Test was applied. 
The  correlation  matrix  and  the  p-value  were  calculated.  The 
correlation  between  model  output  and  ground  truth  values  is 
positive and strong (r=0.845). The Pearson Coefficient appears 
to  be  significant  at  the  significance  level  of  0.05  (p<0.0001) 
(Table-2,  3).  Histogram  of  2  classes  and  scatter  plot  of  their 
combinations are given below (Figure-5).

Spearman’s 
Spearman’s  test  does  not  require  normality  and  it  is  a  non-
parametric statistic. The correlation matrix and the p-value were 
calculated. The correlation between model output and ground 
is  positive  and  moderate  (rs=0.519).  The

Histogram of 2 classes and scatter plot of their combinations are 
given below (Figure-5). The p-value indicates the presence of 
monotonic  correlation.  The  p-value  is  not  equal  to  zero, 
referring to presence of a monotonic correlation and accepting  
the alternative hypothesis.

IV.  DISCUSSION 

The  range  of  knee  flexion  is  a  measure  of  Total  Knee 
Arthroplasty (TKA) outcome. Although the impact of Posterior 
Condylar  Offset  (PCO)  on  the  knee  flexion  is  not  proved for 
certain, there are several studies indicating an association. Since 
a  normal  kinematic  of  the  knee  is  not  restored  by  TKA,  the 
evaluation  of  the  current  kinematic  behavior  maintains  its 
importance. The measurement of PCO in the preoperative and 
postoperative periods provides an opportunity to the physicians 
to  assess  the  limb-restoration  achieved  by  TKA.  The  main 
concern  of 
lack  of  standard 
magnification factor on X-rays (110%-130%). The alterations 
on  the  magnification  factor  result  in  unstable  PCO  values  in 
different  institutions/  hospitals.  In  the  study  conducted  by  P. 
Johal et al., a novel parameter, Posterior Condylar Offset Ratio 
(PCOR),  was 
introduced  with  an  advantage  of  being 
independent from the magnification factor. C.E.H. Scott et al. 
studied both PCOR and ACOR.

The proposed model, AutoCOR, is able to calculate the PCOR 
and ACOR on postoperative lateral knee X-rays by utilizing k-
means clustering and image processing techniques. The model, 
working  in  the  manner  of  landmark  detection,  can  detect 
anterior/  posterior  edge  points  of  the  femoral  component  and 
anterior/posterior  cortex  of  the  femoral  shaft.  The  model  is 
tested by a dataset containing 50 postoperative lateral knee X-
ray from the database PUSULA of Istanbul Medipol Koşuyolu 
Hospital.  The  dataset  is  manually  labeled  by  an  orthopedic 
surgeon to obtain the ground truth values. The PCOR analysis 
revealed  that  the  mean  (standard  deviation)  of  model  output 
(0.984 (SD 0.235)) was close to the ground truth level (0.972 
(SD  0.164)).  The  Shapiro-Wilk  normality  test,  which  was 
applied  to  determine  the  distribution  of  the  PCOR  values, 
turned out as “Normal Distribution” (Model: W=0.982 p=0.635 
-Ground  Truth:  W=0.973  p=0.294).  Pearson  correlation 
coefficient  test  produced  a  strong,  positive  and  significant 
correlation  between  model  output  and  ground  truth  values 
(r=0.845 p<0.0001). 

The  ACOR  analysis  revealed  that  the  mean  (standard 
deviation) of model output (0.107 (SD 0.092)) was close to the 
ground  truth  level  (0.107  (SD  0.070)).  The  Shapiro-Wilk 
normality test, which was applied to determine the distribution 
of the ACOR values, turned out as “Not Normal Distribution” 
for  both  model  and  true  ACOR  data  (W=0.825  p=<0.0001  - 
W=0.952  p=0.042).  In  this  manner,  ACOR  data  is  not 
distributed  normally,  and  Pearson  correlation  tests  cannot  be 
applied.  Spearman's  test  revealed  “moderate  and  significant 
correlation” (rs=0.519 p=0.0001412). 

The analysis of the obtained results was mediated by Bland-
Altman Plots and Histogram of Difference (Fig.6,7). It can be 
concluded that the software, AutoCOR, can calculate the PCOR 
and  ACOR  successfully,  with  slight  deviation.  The  software 
can be improved further and become a clinically-usable tool.

to 
centimeter scale. It was due to the presence of different zoom 
scales  on  the  dataset.  In  order  to  extend  the  scope  of  the 
software,  the  X-ray  images  should  have  the  same  zoom  and 
magnification factors.
