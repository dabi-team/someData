ABSTRACT 

Surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) based devices have emerged as a promising technology 

in magnetic field sensing by integrating a magnetostrictive layer with the giant ŒîE/ŒîG effect. 

However,  almost  all  SAW  magnetic  field  sensors  require  a  bias  field  to  obtain  high 

sensitivity. In addition, the true nature of magneto-acoustic coupling still presents a major 

challenge in understanding and designing of this kind of devices. In current work, a dynamic 

magnetoelastic model for the ŒîE/ŒîG effect is established in consideration of the important 

role of the dipole-dipole interaction. The model is also implemented into a FEM software 

to calculate the resonance frequency responses of multiple fabricated sensors with different 

œà angles between of the acoustic wave vector and the induced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. 

The measured results are in excellent agreement with the simulated ones. A strong resonance 

frequency sensitivity (RFS) of 630.4 kHz/Oe was achieved at zero bias field for the device 

with  optimized  œà  angle.  Furthermore,  the  RFS  measurements  along  different  directions 

verify its vector-sensing capability.

I. Introduction 

Magnetic  field  sensing  is  critical  for  many  applications  including  positioning, 

navigation, electrical current monitoring and biomagnetic field detection, etc. Recently, the 

ÔÅÑE/ŒîG effect has been used to detune cantilever [1‚Äì3], surface acoustic wave (SAW) [4‚Äì

15] or bulk acoustic wave (BAW) [16‚Äì19] devices coated with a magnetostrictive film. The 

ÔÅÑE/ŒîG effect is known as the modification of elastic modulus with respect to a magnetic 

field. Giant ÔÅÑE effect exists in amorphous magnetostrictive materials with high saturation 

magnetostriction  and  low  anisotropy  [20].  Taking  SAW  devices  for  example,  the  phase 

velocity of the piezoelectric substrate becomes dispersive upon depositing a magnetic layer 

onto [4‚Äì8] or in-between [9‚Äì13] the interdigital electrodes (IDTs), or simply replacing the 

nonmagnetic IDTs with magnetic ones [14,15]. An ultrahigh DC magnetic field sensitivity 

of 2.8 Hz/nT and a limit of detection of 800 pT were reported by Li et al. using a AlN/FeGaB 

resonator [17]. Additionally, a very low magnetic noise level of 100 pT/ Hz and a bandwidth 

of 50 kHz have been demonstrated by Kittmann et al. [11] using a Love-mode delay line. 

Even higher sensitivity has been achieved by Schmalz et al. [13] using a Love-mode SAW 

magnetic-field sensor upon optimizing the IDT pitch width. This is because the Love wave, 

also called horizontal shear wave, propagates parallel to the  magnetic  film plane and are 

thus sensitive to changes of shear modulus G, which is more pronounced than the ÔÅÑE effect 

under a magnetic field.   

      However,  these  attractive  sensitivity  values  were  realized  by  applying  certain  bias 

magnetic  fields  (4  Oe  for  FeCoSiB,  12  Oe  for  FeGaB  and  even  400  Oe  Terfenol-

D) [11,17,21]. When used for navigation or biomagnetic applications, a precision range of 

2 

 
only a few Gausses or even lower is sufficient. A large bias field inevitably makes a SAW 

sensor  bulky,  and  consumes  more  power.  Although  self-biased  magnetic  sensors  were 

previously  reported  by  Liu  et  al. [5], the  non-zero  resonance  frequency  sensitivity  (RFS) 

was  attributed  to the  relatively  high  residual  magnetic  moment  and  large  coercive  field, 

contributing to the non-zero change of the Young‚Äôs modulus at zero magnetic field. However, 

a large magnetic hysteresis causes poor sensing linearity. In addition, a true vector sensor 

characterizes  with  the  highly  selective  sensitivity  to  one  direction  but  not  to  the  other 

vertical directions, which is absent in Ref. [5]. Alternatively, the exchange bias effect can 

be employed to design self-biased sensors [3,22]. However, an antiferromagnetic layer can 

only effectively pin a neighboring ferromagnetic layer below a certain thickness (typically 

<100  nm),  which  clearly  set  a  limit  on  the  magneto-acoustic  coupling  and  thus  the 

sensitivity of the magnetic-field sensors.   

In  current  work,  we  propose  a  novel  self-biasing  approach  based  on  a  dynamic 

magnetoelastic  model  of  the  ŒîE/ŒîG  effect.  Vector  SAW  magnetic-field  sensors  were 

designed  and  fabricated  by  adjusting  the  angle  between  the  in-plane  induced  uniaxial 

anisotropy  and  the  SAW  propagation  direction. A  very  high  RFS  of  630.4  kHz/Oe  was 

demonstrated at zero bias field. 

This paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we provide a dynamic magnetoelastic 

model for the  ŒîE/ŒîG effect (Section. II A) and a magneto-acoustic FEM model of a multi-

layered SAW structure (Section. II B) to calculate the resonance frequency response of SAW 

magnetic sensors. Then the methods of device fabrication and measurement are presented 

in Section III. Section IV is devoted to the discussion of experimental results and the impact 

3 

 
of dipole-dipole interaction on the magneto-acoustic coupling (Section. IV A), which was 

used to design self-biased vector magnetic field sensors. (Section. IV B). 

II. THEORY 

Fig. 1 schematically shows the configuration of the SAW magnetic field sensor. A ST-

cut 90oX quartz is selected as the piezoelectric substrate. The Love wave acoustic mode is 

excited by the IDT deposited on the piezoelectric crystal and resonates from reflections of 

the short-circuited reflector on both sides. A ferromagnetic FeCoSiB film is deposited over 

the entire IDTs and reflector grating, with a SiO2 waveguide layer. 

FIG. 1. Schematic illustration of multilayered Love-mode SAW resonator. 

As  an  important  parameter  for  evaluating  device  performance,  the  magnetic  field 

sensitivity  can  be  described  by  the  resonance  frequency  sensitivity  (RFS)  for  a  magnetic 

SAW resonator, 

ùëÖùêπùëÜ =

ùúïùëê
ùúïùêª

(1) 

where f, v and c are the resonance frequency, the phase velocity and the elastic modulus of 

the resonator, respectively.   

As can be seen, RFS is determined by three factors. The foremost factor  ‚àÇc
ùúïùêª

  represents 

4 

 
 
 
 
the variation of elastic modulus with an external magnetic field, which is more familiar as 

the  ŒîE/ŒîG effect.  ‚àÇc
ùúïùêª

 arises from the magnetostrictive strain, and the static  ŒîE/ŒîG effect 

has been modeled in previous works [23‚Äì27].   

Upon applying an external magnetic field, the phase velocity of SAW changes due to 

the variation of the effective elastic modulus of the magnetostrictive/piezoelectric multilayer. 

The  ùúïùë£
ùúïùëê

   term  depends  on  the  ratio  between  the  magnetostrictive  layer  thickness  and  the 

acoustic  wavelength,  the  acoustic  impedance  of  materials  and  the  acoustic  mode  of  the 

structure. In current multi-layered resonator, the Love wave propagates unevenly  in each 

layer,  making  it  difficult  to  determine  ùúïùë£
ùúïùëê

   by  analytical  expressions,  particularly  when 

coupled with micro-magnetics, which increases the complexity of the system. Therefore, a 

magneto-acoustic coupling model is built in Sec. IIB, using the finite element method. 

Finally, the  ùúïùëì
ùúïùë£

  term is determined by the geometric period of the interdigital electrodes 

(IDTs). Although  magnetostriction  also  affects  the  wavelength  and  causes  the  resonance 

frequency  shift,  this  effect  is  negligible [28].  So,  ùúïùëì
ùúïùë£

   is  equal  to  1/ÔÅ¨  in  the  followed 

calculation.

Now, we get the offset angles caused by acoustic wave in any initial condition. At this point, 

a stress-strain constitutive equation of the magnetoelastic material needs to be found. A First

As can be seen, the extra magnetoelastic term,  ùê∏ùëöùëí, is the source of the ŒîE/ŒîG effect, with

B. FEM Analysis of the Magneto-acoustic Coupling 

To illustrate the coupling between the elastic wave and the magnetization dynamics in 

a  multi-layer  structure,  a  frequency  domain  FEM  model  is  built  using  a  commercial 

COMSOL  Multiphysics  simulation  software,  which 

includes  the  micromagnetics, 

piezoelectrics,  elastic  dynamics,  and  the  feedback  of  magnetostrictive  strain  from  the 

magnetic system to the elastic system in a fully coupled manner.   

A ST-cut 90¬∞x quartz is chosen as the piezoelectric substrate with Euler angles (0¬∞, 

132.75¬∞, 90¬∞). Al electrodes of 150 nm, a 0.8 ÔÅ≠m SiO2 waveguide layer and a 140 nm-thick 

FeCoSiB  layer  are  subsequently  constructed  on  the  ST-cut  90¬∞x  quartz.  The  material 

constants of FeCoSiB thin Ô¨Ålm come from Ref. [22,35], whereas the rests are available in 

the  software  library.  The  length  of  the  piezoelectric  substrate  is  equal  to  the  SAW 
9 

 
 
 
wavelength Œª = 10 Œºm, and its thickness is set as 3Œª. A perfectly matched layer and fixed 

constraints at the bottom prevent the interference of body reflected waves with SAWs. For 

simplicity,  only  one  acoustic  wavelength  scale  is  simulated,  and  periodic  boundary 

conditions are imposed on both sides of the sound propagation direction, which corresponds 

to extending the structure infinitely to both sides.   

The behavior of ST-cut 90¬∞x quartz follows the linear piezoelectric equation 

ùõî = ùë™ùë¨ùúºùíÜùíç ‚àí ùêûùë¨, 

ùë´ = ùíÜùëªùúºùíÜùíç + ùùÉ ùë¨, 

(20) 

where D and E are the electrical displacement and electric field, respectively.  CE, Œæ and e 

are the elastic stiffness, permittivity tensor and piezoelectric coupling tensor, respectively. 

As  mentioned  in  Section.  II  A,  the  damped  spin  behavior  in  a  magnetic  field  can  be 

described  by  the  micromagnetic  Eq.  (8).  Equation  (21)  donates  the  strain-displacement 

relationship  for  magnetoelastic  materials,  defining  the  bidirectional  coupling  between 

magnetoelasticity and elastic strain, given by 

ùúºùíïùíêùíï = ùúºùíÜùíç + ùúºùíéùíÜ =

multilayered structure. Additionally, the resonance frequency, deformation and admittance 

changes  of  the  structure  caused  by  the  magnetic  field  can  be  extracted  from  the 

eigenfrequency and frequency domain calculations.   

III.  METHODS OF DEVCE FABRICATION AND MEASUREMENT 

Magnetic  SAW  resonators  were  fabricated  on  ST-cut  90¬∞X  quartz  substrates. 

Aluminum IDTs with a thickness of 150 nm were deposited by thermal evaporation, and 

then  patterned  by  a  photolithography  lift-off  process. All  resonators  consist  of  100  pairs 

IDTs and two sets of 60 electrode reÔ¨Çectors on each end of the device with a wavelength (Œª) 

of 10 Œºm and pitch of 200Œª. A SiO2 layer was deposited onto IDTs and thinned to a thickness 

of 800 nm  by chemical  mechanical polishing (CMP). A 140 nm-thick  FeCoSiB  Ô¨Ålm was 

then deposited on the SiO2 layer by magnetron sputtering using a (Fe90Co10)78Si12B10 target. 

An in-situ magnetic field ~200 Oe is applied during sputtering to induce in-plane uniaxial 

anisotropy.  Six  samples  with  different  angles  (œà  =  0¬∞,  8¬∞,  22.5¬∞,  45¬∞,  67.5¬∞,  and  90¬∞, 

respectively)  between  the  easy  axis  (EA)  and  the  SAW  propagation  direction  have  been 

fabricated, denoted as D1 to D6 devices.   

Fig.3(a) shows the in-plane magnetization versus external magnetic field (M‚ÄìH) curves 

for  the  FeCoSiB  film  measured  by  a  vibrating  sample  magnetometer  (VSM,  BHV-525, 

Japan). The sample shows a clear easy axis with an in-plane saturation field Hk of ~20 Oe 

and a low coercive field Hc of 1.7 Oe. To obtain the high frequency properties of film, we 

have further measured the permeability spectra using a shorted microstrip transmission-line 

perturbation  method [36],  shown  in  Fig.  3(b).  The  measured  natural  ferromagnetic 

11 

 
resonance is about 1.7 GHz, much higher than the operating frequency of SAW resonators. 

Fitting the imaginary permeability spectrum yields an effective damping factor of Œ± = 0.009, 

which ensures the low FMR loss at the operating frequency.   

FIG. 3. (a) M-H curves  of the  FeCoSiB thin  film along  the easy (black) and  hard axis (red), and  (b) 

measured and fitted permeability spectra from 10 MHz to 5 GHz.   

The  frequency response of the SAW resonators upon applying an external  magnetic 

field  was  measured  by  tracing  the  S11  scattering  parameter  using  an  Agilent  network 

analyzer (N5230A). A rotatable Helmholtz coil driven by a current source (ITECH-6502A) 

was  used  to  provide  uniform  in-plane  magnetic  field.  Continuous  magnetic  field  sweep 

ranging between  ¬±80 Oe is sufficient to magnetize the FeCoSiB film to saturation in any 

measuring direction. A Gauss meter (Lake Shore 425) was used to calibrate magnetic field. 

All experiments were carried out at room temperature. 

IV.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

A. Field dependent magneto-acoustic coupling 

Fig. 4 show that the S11 spectrum of a bare SAW resonator with no magnetic overlayer 

exhibits a strong resonance peak at ~477 MHz. The presence of a 140 nm-thick FeCoSiB 

layer with œà = 0¬∞ (D1) significantly down shifts the resonance frequency (fr) to ~447 MHz, 

due to the lower shear wave velocity of FeCoSiB (2029 m/s, calculate by  ‚àö

ùëê44
ùúå

) compare 

12 

 
 
with those of SiO2 and ST-cut 90¬∞X quartz, 3748 and 5047m/s, respectively. Meanwhile, 

the amplitude of resonance peak decays from 8 dB to 0.9 dB. It can be attributed to the large 

extra  capacitance  between  the  magnetic  film  and  the  IDT,  together  with  the  power 

absorption  by  the  magneto-acoustic  coupling [37,38].  FEM  simulations  show  that  the 

displacements of both devices at the resonance frequency can be assigned to the Love mode 

resonance. The inset in Fig. 4 also shows the photo of a packaged SAW resonator. 

FIG. 4. Measured S11 as a function of frequency from SAW resonators with and without FeCoSiB film. 

Inset shows the photo of a packaged device. The displacements at resonance frequencies are obtained 

through COMSOL simulations. 

The  magneto-acoustic  responses  of  D1  and  D6  devices  are  then  measured  upon 

applying magnetic Ô¨Åeld along the hard axis, as schematically illustrated in the inset of Fig. 

5(a) and 5(d). A test cycle consists of three steps: initialization (magnetic field from 0 to 80 

Oe), backward sweep (80 Oe to -80 Oe), and forward sweep (-80 Oe to 80 Oe). Despite a 

small  offset  caused  by  hysteresis,  the  frequency  responses  of  the  three  sweeps  almost 

overlaps, so only the forward sweep is plotted here. Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(d) plot the resonance 

frequency shift of D1 and D6, respectively, which clearly show the difference between the 

two devices. A strong  ŒîG effect is observed for D1 at low sweeping fields from -15 to +15 

13 

 
 
Oe, corresponding to a maximum frequency shift (ÔÅÑfmax) of 3.9 MHz. The highest RFS (or 

df/dH) is about 634 kHz/Oe under an external field of 3.3 Oe. However, the  ŒîG effect is 

negligible  for D6 at low sweeping  fields, and only  becomes  much stronger at high  fields 

above |15 Oe|. ÔÅÑfmax  is about 6.8 MHz and the highest  RFS reaches 775 kHz/Oe under a 

field of -16.6 Oe. To our best knowledge, this sets a record for Love-mode SAW magnetic 

field sensors. The frequency response of former has been reported in previous studies [11], 

and  was  interpreted  from  a  magnetic  mean  field  model,  i.e.  the  angular  dispersion  of 

magnetic moments, arising from stray fields, local stresses, or an intrinsic distribution of the 

easy  axis.  However,  it  cannot  explain  the  frequency  response  or the  ŒîG  effect observed 

from the D6 device.

response as a function of magnetic field. Insets illustrate the measurement set-up where M0 is parallel to

moment orientation as a function of applied magnetic field. 

14 

 
 
To understand the nature of the resonance frequency response, FEM simulations were 

carried out using the magneto-acoustic model in Section. II. As shown in Fig. 5(b) and 5(e), 

the displacements and angular distributions of the magnetic moment in the FeCoSiB film 

are extracted in the case of  ùíåùë∫ùë®ùëæ‚Äñùë¥ùüé  and  ùíåùë∫ùë®ùëæ ‚ä• ùë¥ùüé. Due to the smaller wavelength of 

the magneto-elastic wave compared to the film size, magnetic moments are non-uniformly 

perturbed, leading to a non-zero phase relationship between adjacent magnetic moments. In 

contrast to Fig. 5(b), a non-zero phase distribution of the magnetic moment perpendicular 

to  ùíåùë∫ùë®ùëæ  in Fig. 5(e) yields a dipole field  ‚Ñéùëëùëñùëù. Using Eq. (9), (10) and (12), for  œâ ‚â™ ùúîùë†, 

the in-plane component of dipole field parallel to  ‚Ñéùúë  can be expressed as 

‚Ñéùëëùëñùëù,ùúë = ‚àíùëÄùë†

ùë†ùëñùëõ2ùúë0

(1 ‚àí

Therefore, Eq. (18) can be rewritten as 

‚àÜùëê66 = ‚àí

(24) 

where  ‚Ñéùúë + ‚Ñéùëëùëñùëù,ùúë  is defined as the effective perturbation field. Normalized  ‚Ñéùúë ,  ‚Ñéùëëùëñùëù,ùúë 

and  ‚Ñéùúë +‚Ñéùëëùëñùëù,ùúë are calculated as a function of  magnetic  field H using Eq. (14) and (23), 

and plotted in Fig. 5(c) and 5(f), assuming a constant  ùúÇ12. As far as H is applied along the 

hard axis, there is a consistent relationship between  ‚Ñéùúë  and H for both D1 and D6 devices, 

but  ‚Ñéùëëùëñùëù,ùúë  heavily depends on the angle (ùúë0) between M0 and  ùíåùë∫ùë®ùëæ. When  ùúë0  is close 

to  90¬∞  (high  field  region  in  Fig.  5(c)  and  low  field  region  in  Fig.  5(f)),  |‚Ñéùëëùëñùëù,ùúë|   is 

significantly enhanced, but when  ùúë0  is close to 0¬∞,  |‚Ñéùëëùëñùëù,ùúë|  reduces to zero. In Fig. 5(f), 

the  sum  of  ‚Ñéùúë   and  ‚Ñéùëëùëñùëù,ùúë   is  quite  small  in  the  range  of  -20  to  +20  Oe,  leading  to  a 

suppressed  ŒîG  effect  according  to  Eq.  (24).  As  seen  in  Fig.  5(a)  and  5(d),  our  FEM 

simulation results (black solid line) are in general accordance with the experiments.

FIG. 6. Measured, (a) & (b), and simulated, (c) and (d), frequency responses of D1 and D6 devices, 

respectively, upon applying field along the easy axis. Inset shows the amplified frequency response. 

The  measured  frequency  responses  of  the  D1  and  D6  devices  are  also  significantly 

different from each other upon applying  field along the easy axis. As shown  in Fig. 6(a), 

during  both  forward  and  backward  sweeps,  D1  exhibits  almost  the  similar  magnitude  of 

ÔÅÑfmax as that in Fig. 5(a), and fr jumps at small magnetic fields (¬±1.94 Oe). Both of them can 

be explained by the term  ùúá0ùëØ ‚àô ùë¥  in Eq. (24), which is enhanced by a parallel applied field 

H and reduced by an antiparallel one since  ùúë0 = ùúì. Meanwhile,  magnetic  moments  flip 

180¬∞ upon applying an antiparallel field, causing  ‚àÜùëê66  to jump near the coercive fields (see 

Fig. 3a). For D6 with  ùíåùë∫ùë®ùëæ ‚ä• ùë¥ùüé, the initial magnetic moment orientation  ùúë0  is 90¬∞ and 

doesn‚Äôt change with the applied field, which corresponds to a large  ‚Ñéùëëùëñùëù,ùúë. This makes the 

second term (‚Ñéùúë + ‚Ñéùëëùëñùëù,ùúë) in Eq. (24) very small, and thus the ÔÅÑG effect is attenuated. Fig. 

6(c) and 6(d) plot the simulated results of D1 and D6 upon applying magnetic field along 

the EA. According to Fig. 6(d), the amplitude of frequency response of D6 is around 2 orders 

of magnitudes weaker than that of D1, and thus is nearly buried by noise. Therefore, almost 
16 

 
 
no frequency response can be observed from D6 (Fig. 6(b)). 

In this section, a dipole field is used to explain the different frequency responses of D1 

and D6, which are in good agreement with the experimental results. The deviation between 

the  measured  and  simulated  ones,  especially  between  Fig.  6(a)  and  Fig.  6(c),  may  be 

attributed to dispersed magnetic moments or magnetic domains, which are not considered 

in the Stoner-Wohlfarth model. Fig. 5(d) together with Fig. 6(b) demonstrate that D6 is a 

true  vector  magnetic  field  sensor.  However,  notice  that  a  bias  field  of  ~16.6  Oe  is  still 

required to obtain a high RFS. 

BÔºéAngle dependent magneto-acoustic coupling 

FIG. 7. Measured (top panel) and simulated (bottom panel) frequency responses of D2 (a and d), D3 (b 

and  e)  and  D4  (c  and  f)  devices.  Magnetic  field  is  applied  along  hard  axis.  The  test  cycle  includes 

initialization (black line), backward sweep (red line) and forward sweep (blue line). 

Let‚Äôs now turn to the resonance frequency response of D2, D3, and D4 devices (œà = 

8¬∞,  22.5¬∞  and  45¬∞).  The  measured  frequency  and  simulated  responses  upon  applying  a 

magnetic  field  along  the  hard  axis  are  plotted  on  the  top  and  bottom  panels  of  Fig.  7. 

Compared to the D1 device, D2, D3 and D4 show butterfly-like frequency response curves, 

17 

 
 
and  the  minimum  resonance  frequency  (fmin)  shifts  to  the  right  (or  left)  side  during  the 

forward (or backward) sweep. The higher œà angle is, the larger fmin offset is seen in Fig. 7 

(a-c). The steep frequency response at zero field ensures the high sensitivity of these devices 

even without a bias field.   

In  Equation  (24),  ‚àÜùëê66  exhibits  a  pronounced  ùúë0  dependence,  which  is  controlled 

by both H and œà. In other words, specific magnetization orientation  ùúë0  can be referred to 

different combinations of (H, œà). As shown  in Fig. 5a, the magnetic  moment is rotated a 

special  ùúë0   angle  (about  9.5¬∞)  by  applying  a  3.3  Oe  magnetic  field  to  maximize  RFS. 

Likewise, this angle can also be achieved by directly setting œà = 9.5o during magnetic film 

deposition. Fig. 8 plots the calculated  ‚àÜùëê66  with magnetic field along the hard axis for œà = 

0¬∞ and œà = 9.5¬∞, respectively. The change of œà from 0¬∞ to 9.5¬∞ shifts the entire curve from 

right to left, which is almost equivalent to a bias field of 3.3 Oe, although the magnitude of 

‚àÜùëê66  is slightly different. As a result, a non-zero RFS can be obtained at zero bias field. 

FIG .8. Calculated variation of  ‚àÜùëê66  with magnetic field along the hard axis when œà = 0¬∞ and œà = 9.5¬∞, 

respectively. At point A, a magnetic field of 3.3 Oe rotates magnetic moment orientation  ùúë0 from 0¬∞ to 

9.5¬∞. At point B, magnetic moments are aligned at  ùúë0 =9.5¬∞ under zero bias field by setting œà = 9.5¬∞.   

One obvious strategy to improve the self-biased RFS is to select an appropriate œà that 

18 

 
 
maximizes 

ùúïùëì

ùúïùêª

|

ùêª=0

.  Next, we calculated the relationship between 

ùúïùëì

ùúïùêª

|
ùêª=0

  and œà in the 

range of  ùúì ‚àà [0¬∞, 90¬∞]. As shown in Fig. 9, self-biased RFS values can be obtained at almost 

any œà angles except 0¬∞, 45¬∞, and 90¬∞, and the highest 

ùúïùëì

ùúïùêª

|

ùêª=0

  appears when œà  ‚âà  7¬∞. As 

mentioned above, a large  ùíâùíÖùíäùíë,ùùã  suppresses the  ŒîG effect when œà (œà =  ùúë0  in this case) 

is close to 90¬∞. This will deteriorate RFS, thus making it unsuitable to select œà in the interval 

[45¬∞, 90¬∞]. We  have  measured the  RFS  values of  D1-D6 devices (œà = 0¬∞, 8¬∞, 22.5¬∞, 45¬∞, 

67.5¬∞, and 90¬∞) at zero field and marked in Fig. 9 as well. Again, the measured results are 

in good agreement with the simulated ones. It should be emphasized that the optimal œà angle 

with  the  maximum  self-biased  RFS  is  strongly  affected  by  ùíâùíÖùíäùíë.  For  different  operating 

frequencies,  magnetostrictive  materials,  layer  thicknesses,  or  structures  of  devices,  the 

optimal  œà  angle  must  be  recalculated.  For  example,  a  20  nm-thick  FeCoSiB  film  has  an 

optimal œà angle of 15¬∞ instead of 7¬∞ according to our simulation. 

FIG.  9.  Simulated  and  measured  œà  angle  dependent  RFS  at  zero  bias  field.  Measurement  results  are 

extracted from D1-D6 devices with œà = 0¬∞, 8¬∞, 22.5¬∞, 45¬∞, 67.5¬∞, and 90¬∞.   

Finally, the magnetic field sensitivity of D2 was measured along different directions. 

Fig. 10 plots the calculated df/dH and experimental results at zero magnetic field. An ‚Äò8‚Äô-

like shape is clearly seen. The angles reference to the maximum and minimum RFS locate 

19 

 
 
at ~94¬∞ and 4¬∞, respectively, slightly off HA and EA. The measured highest RFS at zero field 

is about 630.4 kHz/Oe. It demonstrates our sensor's ability to identify vector magnetic fields. 

For  example,  arbitrary  magnetic  field  direction  can  be  determined  by  comparing  the 

frequency  differences  between  three  vertically  placed  sensors,  which  provides  a  solid 

foundation for future array applications of SAW magnetic field sensors.

are obtained by applying external magnetic field along different directions.

Conclusion 

In  summary,  a  dynamic  magnetoelastic  model  of  a  thin  magnetostrictive  film  on  a 

piezoelectric substrate has been established. The magneto-acoustic coupling between them 

was evaluated by measuring the resonance frequency shift of Love-mode SAW sensors. In 

comparison  with  traditional  models,  our  dynamic  magnetoelastic  model  considers  the 

importance of the dipole-dipole interaction, and can explain the distinct frequency responses 

of SAW sensors with different œà angles between the acoustic wave vector and the in-plane 

induced  anisotropy.  Regulation  of  the  dipole  field  have  been  achieved  by  setting  an 

optimized  œà  angle  during  magnetic  film  deposition,  which  not  only  boosts  the  highest 

20 

 
 
sensitivity of SAW magnetic sensors, but also yields a strong RFS of 630.4 kHz/Oe at zero 

bias  field. This  approach  enables  a  simple  implementation  of  self-biased  SAW  magnetic 

field sensors. Furthermore, the FEM simulation model developed in this work can be used 

for future investigations on the magneto-acoustic-electric coupling of other types of SAW 

magnetic field sensors or NEMS magnetoelectric antennas [39].
