ABSTRACT

This Resource Letter provides a guide to the literature on teaching experimental physics using

sensors in tablets, smartphones, and some specialized devices. After a general discussion of the

hardware (sensors) and the software (apps), we present resources for experiments using mobile-

device   sensors   in   many   areas   of   physics   education:   mechanics,   oscillations   and   waves,   optics,

electromagnetism, matter, modern physics, and astronomy. 

I. INTRODUCTION

In   recent   years   there   has   been   a   revolution   in   the   use   of   cell   phones.   In   the   late   2000s,

smartphones   appeared   in   the   market   and   quickly   became   extremely   popular:   about  1.5 ×109

smartphones were sold in 2020, and the vast majority of physics students around the world have

access to a smartphone. 

Smartphones can be a useful experimental tool not only because they have a relatively powerful

processor and can access wireless networks, but also due to the presence  of a number of  built-in

sensors (see Table 1 below). Sensors can determine the orientation of the device, disable the touch

screen, adjust the display’s brightness according to external conditions to save the battery, geolocate

the device, monitor the user’s heart rate, and unlock the device. The set of sensors included in

mobile devices large and is expected to expand in the coming years. 

The relevance of the sensors goes far beyond those everyday uses mentioned: in the past few

years   numerous   educational   and   scientific   applications   have   been   proposed,   including   physics

experiments. As the original intention of sensor manufacturers  was  not to use these sensors  in

science  or  physics  experiments,   some   effort  is  needed  to  transform   smartphones  into  scientific

instruments.   However,   the   reward   for   making   this   effort   is   considerable.     Even   mid-range

smartphones incorporate a broad range of sensors that would otherwise be difficult to acquire. Since

most students already have such a device, they can be combined with easily available equipment

and materials to create a low-cost, compact, multi-sensor experimental platform with no need for

complicated connections or setup. Another factor, less objective, is that students do not consider a

smartphone to be a strange or magical device, since it is part of their daily lives. Whether or not this

fact influences the learning process is still under examination.

We might compare smartphones to devices designed specifically for the use of instructional

laboratory  experiments   in  physics  and  science,  including   the  SmartCart®   (Pasco),   PocketLab®

(Myriad Sensors, Inc), IOLab® (MacMillan), and Go Direct® Sensor Cart (Vernier). These devices

share some capabilities with smartphones, but do not offer the traditional phone functions. In these

devices,   the   selection   of   sensors,   the   connectivity   and   the   software   have   been   designed   for

pedagogy, with student-friendly interfaces. However, these devices are still alien to the student’s

experience, as compared to a smartphone. In addition, these devices must be purchased specifically

for the physics laboratory, as students will not already own them. There also exist several platforms,

such as Arduino or BBC mibro:bit (see Refs. [5, 12, 14, 15, 16] below), that have been adapted to

perform   experiments   using   sensors.   Unlike   smartphones   in   which   the   set   of   sensors   is

predetermined by the manufacturers, these programmable boards allow one to choose from a wide

range of sensors and modules including ultrasound sensors, flame detectors, infra-red emitters and

receptors,   water   level   sensors,   relays,   PIR   (Passive   infra-red),   and   metal   detectors.    We   have

included   a   few   articles   using   Arduino   boards   as   examples   of   experiments   that   could   be

accomplished using a combination of Arduino boards and smartphones.

Communication with sensors requires specific software, known as an app, specially designed to

be executed by the mobile device.  Since most of the mobile devices currently used are based on

two operating systems, iOS and Android, we will discuss the most useful apps running in these

operating systems, but many others also may be useful in specific circumstances. 

This Resource Letter is aimed at physicists and scientists interested in adapting or performing

experiments using mobile-device sensors to collect  real  physical data. Other potential uses of the

mobile   devices   in   the   classroom   such   as   accessing   the   internet,   sharing   data   among   students,

interacting with teachers, clicker-like activities, simulations, among many others, are not considered

here.  Video   analysis   of   physical   phenomena,   which   has   received   a   lot   of   attention   in   the   last

decades, is also not included in this Resource Letter. In the selection of references, preference has

been given to papers in which the experiments can be performed using state-of-the-art software and

hardware.  Within the selection criteria we prioritized articles published in journals—but we also

cite some of the few books already published—that present experiments with sufficient detail and

clarity that they will be straightforward to implement in a classroom.

The organization of this Resource Letter is as follows. As the topic is relatively new, there are

only a few books which are cited in Section II. After that, resources about hardware and useful apps

(software) are discussed. Next, we focus on experiments, starting with references covering multiple

fields   topics  and   then   focusing   on   specific   fields   (mechanics,   oscillations   and   waves,   optics,

electromagnetism,  matter,  modern  physics, and  astronomy).  Finally,  we discuss  citizen  science,

educational proposals, and impact in Physics Education Research (PER).

III. HARDWARE

In Table I we list the most common smartphone sensors and their main characteristics. This

Resource Letter is not focused specifically on the hardware; however, there are many important

aspects that should be considered when designing an experiment with these sensors. Perhaps the

most obvious fact is the existence of quantities of different physical characteristics. For example,

there   are   sensors   that   measure   scalar   quantities,   such   as   the   ambient   light   sensor   and   the

microphone,   and   sensors   that   measure   vector   quantities,   such   as   the   accelerometer   and

magnetometer. Other sensors are more difficult to classify such as the proximity sensor, on-off

sensor, camera (which provides a single or a set of frames), or GPS (for geographical location). In

the case of vector quantities, it is of importance to highlight that the axis refers to a system attached

to the device. The orientation of the axis corresponds to the principal axis of a rectangular box.

Fig. 1. Standard coordinate system of a smartphone and the orientation angles.

The   precise   location   of   the   sensor   inside   the   device   could   also   be   important   in   many

experiments. In some cases, the location of a sensor is rather obvious: the ambient light sensor can

be located simply by moving a finger back and forth above the device while watching the reading

on the sensor. The magnetometer can be approximately located by scanning the device with a small

magnet and watching the magnitude of the magnetic field detected. The precise location of the

accelerometer is frequently needed but is difficult to find; one of the papers below describes a

process for locating it.

elevator,   building   a   simple  Atwood   machine,   measuring   the   centripetal   acceleration   while

dancing, and locating the accelerometer inside a smartphone using a turntable. Each of the

which use the mean value of the measurements taken by the sensors, this article focuses on the

role of the fluctuations detected by the sensors. It shows how to use smartphone sensors to teach

fundamental concepts in error analysis such as the physical meaning of the mean value and

standard   deviation   and   the   interpretation   of   histograms   and   distributions.   Applications   to

everyday situations are described, such as evaluating the steadiness of the device placed on a

VI. MECHANICS

Since   accelerometers   were   one   of   the   first   sensors   to   be   repurposed   for   experimentation,

classical mechanics is the discipline that has received most attention. In addition, in a wide range of

situations the microphone can be used as a stopwatch to accurately measure time intervals between

sounds. Another sensor that can be useful in classical mechanics is the ambient light sensor that can

be turned into a distance sensor after suitable calibration. This section is devoted to experiments in

 
classical mechanics (see also Refs. [20-25]).

https://doi.org/10.1119/1.4872422. One of the advantages of smartphones is the possibility of

using   more   than   one   sensor   simultaneously.   Here,   in   the   context   of   circular   motion,   the

gyroscope (or angular velocity sensor) and the accelerometer are used to independently measure

the angular velocity and the centripetal acceleration of a moving smartphone in a rotating frame.

(2015).   DOI:

 https://doi.org/10.1590/S1806-11173711639.   Because   of   the   principle   of

equivalence, an accelerometer cannot distinguish acceleration from a gravitational field without

additional   information.   Accelerometer   sensors   are,   in   fact,   force   sensors   that   provide   an

apparent   acceleration,  also   known   as   a  g-force   or   force   per   unit   mass,   given   by   the   real

acceleration minus the gravitational acceleration (all vectors).  Using the information from the

gyroscope and the accelerometer sensors, it is possible to obtain the real acceleration of the

mobile device. This article implements this method for a physical pendulum supplemented with

video analysis. (I)

improving   their   precision.   These   experiments   address   concepts   such   as   stationary   waves,

harmonics, resonance, the speed of sound in different media. In addition, the high processing speed

of   built-in   CPUs   allows   real-time   fast   Fourier   transform   (FFT)   analysis   to   identify   the   main

frequencies of a sound wave, measure the resonant frequency of a system, or visualize a melody in a

spectrogram. It is worth noting that most of the experiments  proposed in this  section are very

economical (see also Refs. [21, 22, 25]).  Also note that in some modern smartphones the audio port

is replaced by Bluetooth alternatives. Ref. [16] describes how external sensors can be connected via

Bluetooth.

Thanks   to   the   magnetic   field   sensor,   several   experiments   have   been   designed   to   measure

magnetic   fields   produced   by   currents   or   magnets.   Most   of   these   experiments   are   easy   and

inexpensive to perform. In contrast, experiments involving measurements of voltages or currents are

possible, using the microphone input, transforming the smartphone into a portable oscilloscope.

These are limited due to the danger of damaging the mobile device by connecting a large voltage. A

safer alternative is to send signals to the smartphone via Bluetooth from devices such as Arduino

BLE, as described in Ref. 16.

X. MATTER, FLUIDS, THERMAL PHYSICS

Since smartphone batteries dissipate a considerable amount of energy, temperature sensors are

not usually included in these devices. (But see commercial attachments at https://thermodo.com.)

Thus, thermodynamics experiments for smartphones are rare.

Nonetheless, pressure sensors are available in several smartphone models and experiments in a

variety of topics have been discussed. Other experiments have been proposed using Arduino-based

sensors, and other ingenious setups are based on the cellular radio-frequency receptor.

125.

simple demonstration of skin depth using only a small container filled with salty water and a

waterproof smartphone as a sensor. Several interesting activities are proposed; however, the

XI. MODERN PHYSICS

Although   smartphones   are   not   especially   well-suited   to   performing   experiments   in   modern

physics,   several   creative   experiments   have   been   put   forward,   including   ones   that   enable

experiments on radioactivity or requiring particle detectors. The advantage of smartphones in these

contexts is clear.

135.

“iRadioactivity   -   Possibilities   and   limitations   for   using   smartphones   and   tablet   PCs   as

radioactive counters,” J. Kuhn, A. Molz, S. Gröber, and J. Frübis, Phys. Teach. 52(6), 351-356

(2014). DOI: https://doi.org/10.1119/1.4893089. By covering the camera with a black tape, it is

possible to experiment with radioactivity in an educational setting. The experiments proposed

focus   on   the   inverse-square   law   for   distance,   absorption   laws,   and   decay   of   meta-stable

isotopes. Although camera sensors are sensitive to radiation, the characteristics strongly depend

on   the   specific   sensor.   Since   general   sensors   are   not   sensitive   enough   to   experiment   with

background radiation, a standard radioactivity source, like those present in many educational

laboratories, is needed. A Geiger counter is advisable for comparison.

136.

“Using   smartphones   and   tablet   PCs   for   β--spectroscopy   in   an   educational   experimental

setup,”   S.   Gröber,   A.   Molz,   and   J.   Kuhn,   Eur.   J.   Phys.  35(6),   065001   (2014).   DOI:

(2017).   DOI:  https://doi.org/10.1119/1.5003806.   For   less   than   $100   it   is   possible   for

undergraduates   to   construct   a   muon   detector   using   a   silicon   photomultiplier   to   detect

scintillation light from  particles  and an  Arduino board for data acquisition.  Its  construction

develops machine-shop, electronics-shop, and programming skills. (A).

XII. ASTRONOMY

Experiments  related  to  astronomy  make  use  of the  camera  as   an observational  tool  or that

simulate astronomical concepts such as parallax, planetary transits and occultations. The ambient

light sensor also plays a key role in several of these experiments.

XIII. PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH

Although the use of smartphones in physics laboratories is a recent introduction, researchers

have already started to explore their impact on student learning.

145.

“An investigation into the effectiveness of smartphone experiments on students’ conceptual

knowledge about acceleration,” A. Mazzella, and I. Testa, Phys. Educ. 51(5), 055010, 10 pages

(2016).   DOI:  https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9120/51/5/055010.   This   paper   investigates   the

impact on secondary school students of using smartphone sensors vs. traditional technologies. It

provides detailed information about the activities performed and the assessment questionnaires.

Although there were no great differences in the performance of the groups the results suggest

that   smartphone-based   activities   may   represent   a   valuable   tool   for   teachers   who   want   to

implement   laboratory   activities   at   secondary-school   level.   To   achieve   a   proper   conceptual

understanding specific issues about the smartphone as a transformative scientific instrument

must be addressed. (I)

146.

Educ.  94,   252–275   (2016).   DOI:  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2015.11.008.   A   meta-

analysis synthesizing more than one hundred research reports showed that the application of

mobile devices in education has a moderate sized mean effect. As it focused neither on sensors

nor on experimental activities, the results should be considered with caution. (I)

third-year   university   students   using   open-source,   low-cost  Arduino   boards   and   compatible

sensors (voltage, magnetic field, temperature, light, sound, acceleration, and force). The topics

include   acoustics,   thermodynamics,   waves,   and   matter   (including   superconductivity,   Peltier

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10956-018-9731-7. One of the main conclusions of the work that

investigated students’ learning in pendulum experiments is that “the often-supposed cognitive

disadvantage of distracting learners with technological devices did not lead to reduced learning,

whereas interest and curiosity were apparently fostered. (I)

DOI:  https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6552/abdee2.   In   this   investigation,   traditional   theoretical

exercises are partially replaced by experimental  mini projects using smartphones. While the

students   found   the   experimental   exercises   slightly   more   difficult,   they   resulted   in   a   better

XIV. CITIZEN SCIENCE

Mobile-device sensors are especially suited to a broad range of experiments that enable public

participation in identifying research questions, collecting and analyzing data, and understanding

environmental problems.

iSPEX (http://ispex.nl/en/).  Air pollution. A citizen science project developed in

the Netherlands in 2012 to measure atmospheric aerosols, based on a free app and a low-cost

add-on for smartphone cameras. The instrument is based on that of the Spectropolarimeter

for Planetary EXploration (SPEX). The citizen scientists scan the sky while the phone’s

camera takes pictures through the add-on, recording the spectrum and the linear polarization

of the sunlight that is scattered by suspended dust particles, making a map of contaminants.

CrowdMag

(https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/crowdmag.shtml).

Geomagnetic   field.  A  citizen   science   project   developed   by   the   geomagnetism   group   of

NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The CrowdMag app uses

the built-in magnetometer of the phone of volunteers around the world to send magnetic

field data to the server of the research group. The main goal is to use the citizen generated

 
information to fill in gaps in measurements of Earth’s magnetic field. (I)

MyShake   (https://myshake.berkeley.edu/).   Earthquake   detection.  A   citizen

science app developed by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, that takes

advantage of the ubiquity of smartphones, their built-in GPS, and tri-axis accelerometers to

detect earthquakes. The aim is to build a global earthquake early warning network that does

not replace the standard networks but could be useful in some seismically active places.

More   information   about   the   technical   development   of   the   project   can   be   found   in   the

research paper, “MyShake: A smartphone seismic network for earthquake early warning and

University of Wisconsin–Madison supported by the National Science Foundation and the

American Physical Society, among others. The DECO app enables users around the world to

detect   cosmic   rays   and   other   energetic   particles   using   the   camera   sensors   of   their

smartphones   and   tablets.   The   recorded   events   are   automatically   uploaded   to   a   central

database. In addition to detecting particle events, users can analyze the data produced by

their own or other users’ phones. This work is described in the paper: “Particle identification

XV. FINAL REMARKS

 In the last few years, the use of smartphones and their sensors has had a great impact on physics

teaching. In this Resource Letter we have concentrated on the application of sensors available in a

wide range of mobile devices, setting aside other uses such as access to information on the internet,

preparation of presentations, exchange of ideas between peers or with the teacher, and more. 

It is our view that the most important characteristic in the use of these devices and their sensors

is   their   adaptability   to   a   wide   range   of   applications.  While   sensors   are   most   easily   applied   to

experiments   in   mechanics   or   waves,   they   can   be   used   in   every   possible   field.   They   enable

experiments illustrating elementary concepts, but also can be used in advanced projects that require

considerable mathematical and experimental skills. While accelerometers are most commonly used,

the camera, microphone, and GPS locator are also frequently used, even though they do not fall

within the usual definition of a sensor. Some experiments are based on measuring scalar quantities,

but others involve vectors, logical variables, or matrices. The software used, which works under

different  operating  systems, ranges from very elaborate programs to simple applications, free or

purchased. In some cases, data are transferred to a computer for processing; in others they are

processed on the device itself. Many of the experiments proposed are carried out in laboratories;

however, others are carried out outdoors, in amusement parks, or on means of transport. Some

require laboratory materials or equipment, while others can be carried out with material available in

many homes. There are many advantages to the use of these sensors. Their wide availability is an

important factor. Even in socially disadvantaged contexts there is usually access to mobile devices

at   no   additional   cost,   while   access   to   traditional   educational   materials   may   be   limited   or

nonexistent. Their portability and the convenience of having multiple sensors in one device that

communicate   directly   with   each   other   is   another   great   advantage,   allowing   measurements   and

connections that would otherwise be difficult to achieve.

It is worth asking whether using the sensors in mobile devices represents a significative advance

or only a marginal one. The same question could be asked about the use of smartphones in other

areas, and we believe the answers are essentially the same: access to a set of resources in a single

device, at an affordable price, and in a compact size, is, by itself, a great advantage. The definitive

answer will be provided by users themselves when they choose one alternative or another.

There   are   many   unknown   factors   to   be   faced   in   the   coming   years.   Mobile   devices   have

incorporated   sensors   only   over   the   last   decade.   We   do   not   know   whether   manufacturers   will

continue to include new sensors, or whether their calculation capacity will continue to increase at

the same rate as in recent years.

Perhaps future advances will improve the ease of use of software and data processing. Physics

education research also has much to say, indicating whether future change will be significant or

merely marginal, and in what aspects improved learning outcomes will be noted. In any case, what

we can state is that these devices and sensors are here to stay. As with all new tools or technology

that appear, the best attitude seems to be to analyze their contributions and use them critically and

reflectively.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.  The authors  are very grateful to the anonymous reviewers for

their careful reading and thoughtful comments. We appreciate their suggestions and have included

many of them in this Resource Letter.
