ABSTRACT

We propose a new method for integrating metasurfaces in optical design using semi-analytical
modelling of dielectric nanostructures. The latter computes the output phase of an electric ﬁeld
incident on the metasurface, allowing their use with ray-tracing software. This tool provides a
method to use metasurfaces in optical systems while using built-in optimization processes to avoid
time-consuming computation. To demonstrate the applicability and versatility of our method, we
present variations of a triplet composed of refractive elements and a metasurface. For each of
the systems, similar optical performances are achieved. Our unique and innovative approach to
joining metasurfaces and ray tracing has the potential to promote the design of innovative systems by
exploiting the richness of metasurfaces and the functionality of conventional lens design software.

Introduction

Research on metasurfaces has been motivated by their broad potential for manipulating light. Exotic applications
exploiting their increased control on the wavefront, their polarization sensitivity or their unique chromatic dispersion
were proposed in the past years [4, 1, 3, 17, 12]. Many of these technologies were demonstrated by wave optics
computation, sometimes followed by experimental work. Indeed, high nonlinear responses [16], multifunctional
metalens [23, 11] or non-Hermitian metasurfaces [9] can be found in the literature, to cite a few.

The utility of metasurfaces has been praised many times; some even say they have the potential to replace traditional
optics [20, 26, 14]. However, their integration in conventional lens design remains a little-explored avenue. Considering
metasurfaces in a complete optical system is inconceivable if common time-consuming numerical methods are used.
The macroscopic scale of elements and the large number of iterations required to design a suitable system [24] would
require too much computing power. Therefore, a method to efﬁciently represent metasurfaces in a ray-tracing process is
needed. Such a method could originate from modelling the optical properties of meta-atoms.

Thus, we propose an approach for using metasurfaces in ray-tracing applications thanks to the efﬁcient characterization
of their optical properties provided by a model. Section 2 describes the ray-tracing equations adapted for propagation
through metasurfaces. Such equations will later be implemented in ray-tracing software like Zemax®. Then, in section
3, a semi-analytical model computing the optical properties of a metasurface composed of dielectric nanocylinders is
given. This modelling is a continuation of our previous work, where rectangular structures were studied [2, 6]. Results
obtained by this model are then compared to FDTD simulations in section 4. Finally, we present optical designs using
different refractive lenses and metasurfaces targeting the same application to display the method’s versatility in section
5.

 
 
 
 
 
 
2 Ray-tracing through a metasurface

As the ray-tracing method is based upon calculating the angle of refraction at each optical surface, it is natural to start
our implementation with the generalized law of refraction for metasurfaces proposed by Yu et al. [28]. Here is the case
for the general refraction

nt sin θt − ni sin θi =

λ
2π

∂ϕ
∂r

,

(1)

where the metalens implements a phase ϕ on the wavefront, and ni, θi and nt, θt are the refractive index and the
incidence angle before and after the metasurface.
In optical design software such as Zemax® or CodeV®, rays are represented by a three-dimensional vector R =
xˆx + zˆz + zˆz. The orientation of such a ray is deﬁned by its direction cosines l, m and n.

l = cos ux, m = cos uy, n = cos uz,

(2)

where ux, uy et uz are the angles formed by the vector R and the axes ˆx, ˆy and ˆz. Considering metasurfaces are ﬂat
components placed perpendicular to the optical axis in most cases, we can establish that θi = 90◦ − u =⇒ sin θi =
cos u. Thus, by rearranging Eq. 1 with nt = ni = 1 using the direction cosines, the following set of equations for the
coordinates (l(cid:48), m(cid:48), n(cid:48)) of the refracted beam can be obtained

,

The normalization condition l2 + m2 + n2 = 1 was used for the n(cid:48)-coordinate. If one wishes to perform ray tracing
through a metasurface, one must know the phase shift induced for a given incident beam

3 Semi-analytical model

As stated previously, obtaining the phase shift implemented by the metasurface via conventional full-wave simulations
is inconceivable for lens design purposes considering the standard optimization process. Therefore, a model that
can efﬁciently output the optical properties used for ray-tracing is advisable. Therefore, this section concerns the
development of an expression for the phase shift of cylindrical nanostructures, an essential parameter for performing
the ray tracing as previously determined.

Related to our earlier work about nanoﬁns [2], the guided propagation through a nanocylindrical waveguide can be
described as a phase accumulation of the electrical ﬁeld given by the optical path of an equivalent wave in a medium of
length H as a ﬁrst-order approximation.

where τj and βj are respectively the complex amplitude and the propagation constant of the waveguide mode j. For the
needs of our application, we consider the fundamental mode, leaving only to obtain the complex amplitude and the
propagation constant of the latter.

3.1 Propagation constant

The propagation constant β of a single nanocylindrical structure can be obtained by solving the following dispersion

2 = β2 − ω2µ0(cid:15)2. ω, µ0, (cid:15)1 and (cid:15)2 are the common physical constants. Jn and Kn are the

Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind and the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind order n respectfully with prime as
the derivative of those function.

From the propagation constant of an isolated structure, it is necessary to add a correction to consider the coupling
effects, knowing that a metasurface is composed of an array of equidistant nanostructures. To do so, Coupled Mode
Theory (CMT) is often used because of its simplicity, but multiple approximations should be met for its computation
to be accurate [10]. To consider the periodicity, we will apply a correction to the propagation constant following the
Minot method [19]. Using the slowly-varying envelope and assuming a coupling C which is much smaller than the
propagation constant, a long-established approximation of the effective propagation constant of an array of waveguides
is expressed as

βarray = βisolated +

where S the distance between waveguides, kx is the transverse Floquet-Bloch waves and C the coupling. Here, we will
assume that kx = p+1

where Mp correspond to the transverse ﬁeld distribution of the p structure of the array. For our implementation, N = 2
and p = 0 are used, corresponding to the correction of the closest neighbour. For more details on the calculations
applied for cylinder structures, see appendix A.

3.2 Complex amplitude

Using the Snell-Descartes law, one obtains the transmission angles at the ﬁrst and second sides of the nanocylinder.
Because of the high contrast of the refractive indices often used in dielectric metasurfaces [3, 13], multiple scattering
events might occur. To take this phenomenon into account, we consider the Fabry-Perot effect of the nanostructure by
introducing a simple geometric sum formulated as

τ =

t1t2
1 − r1r2e−i2βH ,

(12)

where t1,2, r1,2 correspond to the transmission and reﬂection coefﬁcients at the ﬁrst or second interface of the nanoﬁn,
and β is the propagation constant inside of the nanocylinder of height H.

Finally, from Eq. 6, the output phase-shift ϕ produced by a nanorod of radius a considering only the fundamental mode
is given by

ϕ(a) = arg

4 Meta-atoms properties

The semi-analytical model allows for computing the phase shift introduced by those nanostructures under various
illuminations. Fig. 1a presents the phase shift ϕ for 600 nm high TiO2 nanocylinders on a SiO2 substrate for wavelengths
λ from 568 nm to 628 nm. The structures at a varying radius between 45 and 110 nm are located 350 nm apart. These
parameters were used since they correspond to metasurfaces often represented in the literature [18, 7, 22]. As one can
observe, the phase can be accurately modelled for various wavelengths when compared to FDTD simulations using
Lumerical software [25]. We can also extend our analysis to illuminations at various incidence angles, as shown in Fig.
1b where the incident beam of light comes at a 20◦ ﬁeld of view.

(b) Illumination at 20◦ ﬁeld of view

Figure 1: Output phase shift at various wavelengths for our model and Lumerical simulations. TiO2 meta-atoms are 600
nm high on a SiO2 substrate with a spacing of 350 nm between structures (nTiO2 =2.6139 and nsub=1.4584 at λ = 588
nm) with TM plane wave illumination beam.

To assess the magnitude of the error in our predictions relative to numerical simulations and the impact this would have
in a lens design context, we refer to the work of Patoux et al. [21]. Through their research regarding nanofabrication
errors and their effect on metasurfaces performances, they concluded that the fabrication error must be limited to 10 nm
for a metalens to maintain acceptable quality. We have identiﬁed that the deviations observed in Fig. 1 are equivalent to
a variation of 1-4 nm in radius on average which is well below the speciﬁed limit of 10 nm. Furthermore, a numerical
study on the variation of the Strehl ratio showed that errors similar to those shown in Fig. 1 still lead to a metalens
with a Strehl ratio above 0.9. Such results conﬁrm that the accuracy of our model compared to FDTD simulations is
sufﬁcient to represent metasurfaces with performance limited by nanofabrication errors. Therefore, our approach is
relevant to computing the properties of the nanostructures and shows the interest of a semi-analytical model to perform
a quick initial and optimized design.

5 Optical design with metasurfaces

To effectively integrate metasurfaces into the design process, it is of utmost importance that the designer can modify and
optimize its characteristics just like any other optical component of the system. Therefore, the model’s implementation
in the design process was carried out with this objective as a priority. In this section, a design methodology is proposed
and then applied to present "meta-refractive" hybrid optical systems as a demonstration.

5.1 Design process

distribution, the output wavefront and the incident rays’ refraction angle.

The optical design software Zemax has been selected for our ﬁrst proof of concept. Its ability to process user-deﬁned
surfaces via a dynamic link library (DLL) is an adequate solution to handle calculations related to the semi-analytical
model. Its operating principle is shown schematically in Fig. 2. First, Zemax initiates rays and propagates them until
the metasurface is reached. Once intercepted, the DLL starts by deﬁning the metasurface from the characteristics of the
meta-atoms and the target phase shift proﬁle (subsection 5.1.1). The model then computes the wavefronts so that the
refraction angles of the rays are given as output by the DLL (subsection 5.1.2). Exiting the DLL, traditional ray-tracing
is resumed across the rest of the optical system. Ultimately, the lens designer can use performance analysis tools to
evaluate the system (subsection 5.1.3).

5.1.1 Deﬁning the metasurface

Directly from the Zemax GUI, a lens designer can choose suitable materials and dimensions for the nanostructures.
The ﬁrst step of the design process starts by deﬁning the physical characteristics of the structures to be used: material,
dimensions and spacing between structures. For a given height, it is necessary to deﬁne an interval of radius (amin, amax)
allowing an adequate phase covering, i.e. |ϕ(amax) − ϕ(amin)| ≥ 2π. A lens designer can ﬁnd such information with
simple preliminary analyzes using the model corroborated by numerical simulations.

The design phase shift can be expressed in two ways. First, if one desires to produce metalenses speciﬁcally designed for
focusing, a hyperbolic phase proﬁle is best suited (Eq. 14). Such phase shift leads to a perfect focal spot on the optical
axis at a distance f for a plane incident wavefront. However, for a metasurface located between multiple elements, a
polynomial phase proﬁle offers much-needed additional degrees of freedom. The phase relation should be deﬁned as
Eq. 15.

(15)

Once the metasurface target phase shift is deﬁned, the model is then put to work. Starting from the design phase proﬁle
ϕ(r, λd), the nanorods’ distribution a(r, λd) that reproduces exactly ϕ(r) at the design wavelength λd is found. To do
so, the phase relation developed in section 3 should be inverted in order to obtain a distribution of propagation constant
as β = ϕ(r)/H. Since the only unknown of this relation is now the radius a of the nanocylinder, the radius distribution
needed to obtain a target phase distribution is computed.

For the sake of this numerical application, a continuous distribution of structures of varying dimensions is assumed
(see inset of Fig. 2). From the spatial distribution of the structures, the model is again used to determine the resulting
wavefront for each wavelength and ﬁeld of view. Finally, the ray-tracing equations developed previously (Eq. 3 to
5) deﬁne the angles of refraction of the incident beam from the phase gradient of the metasurface. Finally, the ray’s
updated information is given back to Zemax so that ray tracing can continue throughout the system.

5.1.3 Coming up with a design

One of the advantages of our approach is to be able to exploit directly the optimization algorithms included in the
design software. Thus, it is possible to optimize for the most efﬁcient optical system at several wavelengths and ﬁelds of
view, with a proper merit function, while considering the unique behaviour of metasurfaces. Moreover, a lens designer
can study how a slight variation in the dimensions of the structures can impact the performance and may enhance the
system.

The optimization completed and the performance deemed sufﬁcient, one might want to perform a conﬁrmation with
full-wave simulations. The wavefront obtained by simulations, possibly slightly different from the one predicted by
the model, can be substituted in Zemax®. If necessary, ﬁne adjustments can be made to downstream elements to
compensate for these differences and regain the target optical performances. This way, optimizing performances using
the model in the ﬁrst place provides an adequately accurate starting point that only requires realistic adjustments when
moving to numerical FDTD results.

Ultimately, the resulting metasurface is fabricated using conventional nanofabrication methods. Specialized software
such as MetaOptics [8] makes it possible to obtain a technical drawing of the distribution of nanostructures to be
designed.

5.2 Hybrid refractive and metalens designs

To demonstrate the efﬁciency and versatility of our method for obtaining metasurface-based optical systems, we now
present several variations of a triplet composed of two refractive elements and a metasurface (see Fig. 3). The decision
to design a triplet was taken considering that this type of system is the simplest that can correct all of the seven Seidel
aberrations over a wide ﬁeld of view [15].

According to our process, the ﬁrst step is deﬁning the structures used in the design. For continuity purposes, we have
chosen the nanocylinders presented in section 4 for the metasurface, knowing that these respect the phase coverage
condition and that the model agrees with numerical FDTD simulations. We then arranged the metasurface as either the
last (Fig. 3a), second (Fig. 3b) or ﬁrst (Fig. 3c) element among a combination of two lenses. The arbitrary goal being to
design an imaging system with an f /# = 6 suitable for a ±10◦ ﬁeld of view (FoV), we optimized the metasurface’s
phase shift proﬁle in addition to the characteristics of the other lenses to obtain a system with almost diffraction-limited
performance. For reasons mentioned earlier, we chose a polynomial phase proﬁle over its hyperbolic counterpart to
achieve this task.

Figure 3: Variations of a f /# = 6 triplet using two refractive lenses and a metasurface (λ = 588 nm, FoV = ±10◦).
The metasurface is either the last (a), the second (b) or the ﬁrst element (c). For each conﬁguration, the spot diagrams
and the modulation transfer function (MTF) were chosen as a criterion for performance evaluation.

All three systems display good optical performances, a fact suggested by the focal spots of a smaller size than 10 microns.
The Airy spot being 8.6 microns in diameter for these systems means that almost diffraction-limited performance is
achieved for the whole ﬁeld of view. An analysis of the modulation transfer function (MTF) supports these conclusions.
Indeed, high contrast is achieved at resolutions suitable for most imaging requirements. As mentioned previously, we
can expect a slight variation of the predicted phase compared to the FDTD simulations generating a degradation in the
optical quality of the metasurface. However, we have determined that for errors listed in Fig. 2, the greatest degradation
on the RMS spot size was 0.1 µm for system 3a), 0.2 µm for 3b) and 0.4 µm for 3c). Such variations do not represent a
considerable loss of optical quality, highlighting the adequate accuracy of our model.

The optimization process made it possible to adapt the metasurface, just like conventional optics, to the system and thus
lead to similar overall performance regardless of its positioning. It demonstrates one of the main advantages of our
method: considering metasurfaces as a standard optical element in the optimization process while obtaining an accurate
performance evaluation.

6 Conclusion

To conclude, we present a new method to implement metasurfaces in the lens design process via a semi-analytical
model used in conjunction with ray-tracing software. We had to adapt the ray tracing equations to consider a phase
shift induced by metasurfaces in the ﬁrst place. Instead of going through lengthy numerical simulations to predict the
phase shift, the latter is provided by a semi-analytical model that we have developed. Based on an effective medium
theory, the Fabry-Perot effect and a closed-form approximation of the coupled-wave theory, our model predicts the
phase shift introduced by cylindrical nanostructures. We then proceeded to its implementation in the optical design
software Zemax through a DLL. Starting from a target phase shift for the metasurface, the model integrated into the
DLL renders the distribution of nanostructures and calculates the output wavefront so that a ray of a given wavelength
and orientation can continue through the system. It led to the development of a 3-step feedback process exploiting the
ability to include the metasurface in the optimization routine of an optical system. For demonstration purposes, we have
designed hybrid refractive and metasurface systems composed of two refractive elements and a metasurface. The latter,
being located at distinct positions for each system, was able to adapt just like conventional elements to render a system
with near-diffraction-limited performance across the entire ﬁeld of view.

Further developments in the generalization of the method to other types of meta-atoms are to be expected. For example,
using intrinsically achromatic structures or efﬁcient structures with a large ﬁeld of view would make it possible to
exploit the full potential of metasurfaces in optical design. Ultimately, experimental work could corroborate the accuracy
of the semi-analytical model and the relevance of our approach.
