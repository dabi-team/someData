ABSTRACT
We present a detailed analysis of short GRB 201221D lying at redshift 𝑧 = 1.045. We analyse the high-energy data of the burst
and compare it with the sample of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). The prompt emission characteristics are typical of those
seen in the case of other SGRBs except for the peak energy (𝐸p), which lies at the softer end (generally observed in the case
of long bursts). We estimate the host galaxy properties by utilising the Python-based software Prospector to ﬁt the spectral
energy distribution of the host. The burst lies at a high redshift relative to the SGRB sample with a median redshift of 𝑧 = 0.47.
We compare the burst characteristics with other SGRBs with known redshifts along with GRB 200826A (SGRB originated from
a collapsar). A careful examination of the characteristics of SGRBs at diﬀerent redshifts reveals that some of the SGRBs lying
at high redshifts have properties similar to long GRBs indicating they might have originated from collapsars. Further study of
these GRBs can help to explore the broad picture of progenitor systems of SGRBs.

1 INTRODUCTION

The bi-modality in duration distribution of Gamma-Ray Bursts
(GRBs) revealed two broad populations identiﬁed as short and long
1 duration with separation boundary at 2 sec,
GRBs (based on𝑇90
Mazets et al. 1981; Kouveliotou et al. 1993). The two GRB popu-
lations are likely originating from two distinct progenitor systems,
with diﬀerent redshift distribution and located in diverse host galaxy
environments (Nakar 2007; Berger 2014; Levan et al. 2016). The
association of long GRBs with broad-lined supernovae of Type Ic
and their occurrence in star-forming galaxies conﬁrmed their associ-
ation with collapsars (Woosley 1993; MacFadyen & Woosley 1999;
Hjorth et al. 2003; Woosley & Bloom 2006; Li et al. 2016). On the
other hand, a mix of young and old stellar population of host galax-
ies of SGRBs and the lack of associated supernova suggests that at
least a fraction of SGRBs originate from compact object mergers
(Berger 2009; Fong et al. 2013; Beniamini & Piran 2016). The dis-
covery of gravitational wave signal GW170817 and its association

with SGRB 170817A conﬁrmed this hypothesis (Abbott et al. 2017;
Goldstein et al. 2017; Valenti et al. 2017).

However, some of the long GRBs (like GRBs 060614 and 060505)
have no evidence of supernova association despite long follow-up
(Della Valle et al. 2006; Fynbo et al. 2006; Gal-Yam et al. 2006).
Similarly, signatures of collapsars are seen in some of the SGRBs
(for example, SGRBs 090426 and 200826A, Antonelli et al. 2009;
Thöne et al. 2011; Nicuesa Guelbenzu et al. 2011, 2012; Ahumada
et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2021; Rossi et al. 2021). The absence of su-
pernova signatures in long GRBs and the occurrence of SGRBs from
collapsars challenge our current understanding of GRB population
and their progenitor systems. Several attempts have been made in the
past to devise new classiﬁcation schemes based on diﬀerent criteria
other than 𝑇90 . Zhang (2006) divided the GRBs into Type I (compact
star origin) and Type II (massive star origin) classes. Bromberg et al.
(2013) classiﬁed the GRBs as collapsars and non-collapsars based
on the non-collapsar probability. Later, Minaev & Pozanenko (2020)
used the 𝐸𝛾,iso - 𝐸p,i correlation to divide the GRBs in two classes.
These works have allowed to develop a classiﬁcation scheme beyond
the traditional 𝑇90 distribution.

1 𝑇90 is the duration over which a particular instrument observes 5% to 95%
of the total counts.

The distance measurement of the bursts can also provide essential
information about their intrinsic energy budgets, the progenitor age
distribution, and its relation to star-formation (Guetta & Piran 2005;

Dimple et al.

Berger et al. 2007; Ghirlanda et al. 2009; D’Avanzo 2015). Therefore,
the redshift distribution of GRBs serves as a clue to the progenitor
systems. SGRBs are generally found at low redshifts (with a median
redshift 𝑧 = 0.47) compared to long GRBs (with a median redshift 𝑧 =
1.68; see section 4 for details). The redshift distribution of SGRBs
can be explained through their formation channel. The time taken by
compact objects to merge (through energy/angular momentum loss
by GW radiation) is quite long (Belczynski et al. 2006; Beniamini
et al. 2016). Therefore, if SGRBs originate from compact object
mergers, they are more likely to lie at lower redshifts. However, a
fraction of SGRBs are found to be located at high redshifts ( Ugarte
De Postigo et al. 2006; Berger et al. 2007).

It has also been observed that SGRBs at 𝑧 > 1 have a high proba-
bility of being collapsars (Bromberg et al. 2013). It is also interesting
to note that both the SGRBs 200826A (𝑧 = 0.7481; Rossi et al.
2021) and 090426 (𝑧 = 2.609; Antonelli et al. 2009), which have
been found to originate from the death of massive stars, lie at the
higher end of the redshift distribution of SGRBs. GRB 201221D is
located at the higher end of the GRB redshift distribution (𝑧 = 1.045,
Agüí Fernández et al. 2021), which gives rise to the question if the
burst originates from a collapsar or a merger? In general, it is vital
to investigate if the SGRBs lying at high redshifts have progenitor
systems similar to the SGRBs lying at low redshifts? To address this
question and the progenitor conundrum, we compare the properties
of SGRBs in the context of the available redshift information.

The paper presents a detailed analysis of GRB 201221D and its
comparison with other low and high redshift SGRBs. The data reduc-
tion procedure and analysis are described in §2. The results obtained
are discussed in §3, including the properties of the host galaxy. In
addition, we compare the SGRBs with known redshift to identify
the similarities and diﬀerences between high and low redshift SGRB
samples in §4. A brief summary of this work is presented in §5.
We quote all the uncertainties at 1𝜎 throughout this paper (unless
otherwise mentioned). We used the Hubble parameter H0 = 70 km
sec−1 Mpc−1, and the density parameters ΩΛ = 0.73, and Ωm = 0.27
in this paper. The measured redshift of 𝑧 = 1.045 corresponds to a
luminosity distance of 7109 Mpc.

2 DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS

Swift triggered on GRB 201221D on December 21 2020, with the
burst having a duration of 0.3 sec (Page et al. 2020). The Fermi
and Konus-Wind missions also detected the burst (Hamburg et al.
2020; Frederiks et al. 2020). Later, various ground-based telescopes
started observations of the burst location to search its optical coun-
terpart. Spectroscopic observations of the optical counterpart of
GRB 201221D with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) provided
the measurement of the redshift of 𝑧 = 1.045 ( Ugarte de Postigo
et al. 2020). We also observed the burst location with the 3.6m Dev-
asthal Optical Telescope (DOT) and detected an extended source at
the location of the burst (Dimple et al. 2020).

This section describes the data acquisition and analysis, using
the data from diﬀerent space and ground-based instruments, in the
prompt emission and afterglow phase.

of the source was found to be at RA: 11h 24m 12s and Dec: +42d
08m 39s (J2000) with an uncertainty radius of 3(cid:48) (Page et al. 2020).
To extract the temporal and spectral features from the Swift/BAT
data, we obtained the raw data from the Swift Archive Download
Portal supported by the UK Swift Science Data Centre2. We utilized
HEASOFT version-6.25 with the latest Swift calibration data ﬁles3
to reduce this data. The three primary tools, namely batbinevt,
bathotpix and batmaskwtevt were used to create the Detector
Plane Image (DPI), to detect the hot pixels, and for mask-weighting,
respectively. The mask-weighted light curve in the 15 − 150 keV
energy range is extracted using batbinevt. The bottom panel of
Fig. 1 shows the Swift/BAT light curve. The light curve consists of a
single-peaked structure with a duration 𝑇90 = 0.16 ± 0.04 sec (Page
et al. 2020; Krimm et al. 2020).

Furthermore, we obtained the time-averaged spectrum in a time
interval starting from T0 -0.064 sec to T0 +0.192 sec following the
method speciﬁed in the Swift/BAT software guide4. The pha and
response ﬁles obtained are used for joint spectral analysis along with
Fermi data (see section 2.3).

2.2 Fermi/GBM

The Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM, Meegan et al. 2009) on-
board the Fermi spacecraft triggered and located GRB 201221D at
23:06:34.33 UT. Initially, the ﬂight software classiﬁed the trigger as
a particle event. Later, it was conﬁrmed to be an SGRB with a 𝑇90
duration of about 0.14 sec (50-300 keV). The burst location provided
by Fermi was consistent with the Swift/BAT position (Hamburg et al.
2020). We used the time-tagged event (TTE) data of GBM obtained
from the GBM trigger data archive5 for spectral and temporal anal-
ysis of the burst in the high-energy regime. We chose the detectors
with low observing angles and high count rates. Three sodium iodide

Band function. Based on the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC;
Kass & Raﬀerty 1995), Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), and
Log(likelihood) for each model, we found that the spectrum is best
described with a CPL with power-law index of −0.20 ± 0.16 and
cutoﬀ energy 𝐸𝑐 = 51.14+7.2

−13 keV with a ﬂuence of (1.02 ± 0.1) × 10−6 erg cm−2,
consistent with the values reported by Hamburg et al. (2020).

2.3.1 Time-resolved spectroscopy

For time-resolved spectral analysis, we created the time bins from
background-subtracted Fermi/GBM light curves by applying the
bayesian blocks (Scargle et al. 2013) to the main emission inter-
val (T0 -0.064 to T0 +0.192 s). We used the NaI-8 detector with the
maximum count rate and obtained four Bayesian bins. However, we
could use only three bins for spectral analysis as the ﬁrst bin did
not have suﬃcient counts to be modelled. We created the spectra for
three bins and ﬁtted them with various models (Band, Black Body,
and CPL). We found that all of these spectra are well described with
the CPL function. The best-ﬁt model and the spectral parameters ob-
tained from the time-resolved spectroscopy for GRB 201221D are
listed in Table 1.

The evolution of spectral parameters is shown in Fig. 3. All the
parameters (ﬂux, 𝛼 and 𝐸p) are seen to follow the same evolution
pattern. The ﬁgure also shows a comparison of the evolution of
parameters with an SGRB sample presented in Burgess et al. (2019).
The values of diﬀerent parameters in the case of GRB 201221D are
typical, following a hard-to-soft evolution, as compared to the sample
of SGRBs except for the cut-oﬀ energy, which lies at the lower end
of the distribution.

2.4 Swift/XRT

The X-ray telescope (XRT; Burrows et al. 2005) on-board Swift
started observing the ﬁeld at 23:08:01.7 UT, 87.4 sec after the BAT
trigger. A new, faint, uncatalogued X-ray source was detected at RA:
11h 24m 14.19s, Dec: +42d 08m 35.5s (J2000) with an uncertainty
of 5.(cid:48)(cid:48)7 (radius, 90% containment). Due to the faintness of the source,
XRT observed it only in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The X-ray af-
terglow light curve, available at the Swift online repository8 provided
by the University of Leicester (Evans et al. 2007, 2009), consists of
only one data point (with a large error in time) followed by an up-
per limit. Further investigation of the X-ray afterglow could not be
performed. However, in §4 we compare the X-ray light curves of
SGRBs, including GRB 201221D.

Figure 2. Prompt emission light curves of GRB 201221D in diﬀerent energy
channels of Fermi/GBM with a time resolution of 64 ms. The burst duration
in higher energy channels is shorter than that in lower energy channels.

(NaI) detectors: n7, n8, and nb were selected by visually inspecting
the count-rate light curves and source observing angles (n7 – 43◦,
n8 – 5◦, nb – 57◦). One of the bismuth germanate detectors (BGO1
– 61◦), closer to the direction of burst) was also included in our
analysis.

We used RMFIT6 (version 4.3.2) to visualize the light curves from
the TTE ﬁles. From these light curves, we carefully selected the
source and background. We ﬁtted the background with various poly-
nomial functions. The best-ﬁtted background was subtracted from
the source to produce light curves in diﬀerent energy bins. The
background-subtracted multi-channel prompt emission 𝛾-ray/hard
X-ray light curves are shown in Fig. 2.

For spectral analysis, the background-ﬁtted time-averaged spec-
trum for the time bin between T0 -0.064 to T0 +0.192 sec was
obtained using the GTBurst software from the Fermi Science Tools.
The pha ﬁles obtained are used for joint spectral analysis along with
Swift data (see section 2.3).

2.3 Joint Swift and Fermi spectral analysis

To investigate the emission mechanism of GRB 201221D, we per-
formed a joint spectral analysis of Fermi/GBM and Swift/BAT data
using threeML (3ML,7 Vianello et al. 2015) version 2.3.1. Joint spec-
tral analysis was done utilizing the Fermi/GBM spectrum over the
energy range of 8 − 900 keV (for NaI) and 200 − 30000 keV (BGO)
and the Swift/BAT data with energy range 15 − 150 keV. We re-
moved the 33 − 37 keV energy channels to ignore the K-edge (33.17
keV) of the Na line from the spectral analysis of NaI data. We tried
to ﬁt the spectrum with a power-law function having an exponen-
tial cutoﬀ (CPL model), Band function and Black Body along with

Figure 3. Evolution of spectral parameters for GRB 201221D and its compar-
ison with the sample of SGRBs taken from Burgess et al. (2019). The photon
index and ﬂux values are typically comparable to the SGRB sample. However,
the peak energy value of the burst is quite low in the last bin compared to the
sample of SGRBs. All these parameters follow a hard-to-soft evolution.

2.5 Optical

The optical afterglow emission of GRB 201221D was discovered
using the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) at ∼ 1.67 hr after the
burst with 𝑟 (cid:48) = 23.1 ± 0.3 mag (Malesani & Knudstrup 2020). Spec-
troscopic observations with the GTC/OSIRIS at ∼2.76 hr after the
burst showed evidence of absorption lines (Agüí Fernández et al.
2021), yielding a redshift 𝑧 = 1.045. This is only the third spectrum
of a SGRB afterglow (after GRB 130603B and GRB 160410A; Cuc-
chiara et al. 2013; Ugarte de Postigo et al. 2014; Agüí Fernández
et al. 2021) which displayed absorption-line features. The 𝑟 (cid:48)-band
acquisition image from GTC/OSIRIS detected the afterglow with a
magnitude of 23.95 ± 0.20 mag (Agüí Fernández et al. 2021). A
source was also identiﬁed in the observations with the Large Mono-
lithic Imager (LMI) on the 4.3m Lowell Discovery Telescope in 𝑟 (cid:48)
and 𝑖(cid:48) bands at ∼ 10.11 hr (Dichiara et al. 2020). Further multi-

band observations of the host galaxy were also performed with the
Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) and Large Binocular Telescope
(LBT) (Rastinejad et al. 2021; Rossi & CIBO Collaboration 2021;
Agüí Fernández et al. 2021). The optical/NIR magnitudes of the
afterglow/host available in the literature are listed in Table 2.

2.5.1 Our observations

We observed the ﬁeld of GRB 201221D using the 4K × 4K ARIES
Devasthal Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (ADFOSC, Omar
et al. 2019) mounted on 3.6m DOT of ARIES Nainital. Four consec-
utive images of 15 min exposure time each were taken on December
22, 2020 (∼ 1 day after the burst) in the 𝑟 (cid:48) band (Dimple et al.
2020). The pre-processing of the images, including bias subtraction,
ﬂat-ﬁeld correction and cosmic-ray removal, was performed using the
Astropy and CCDproc modules in Python. The cleaned images were

aligned using astroalign and stacked using the mediancombine
function of CCDProc to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. An ex-
tended source is visible at the position of the burst (Fig. 4). We
performed PSF photometry on the stacked image using DAOPHOT and
estimated the magnitude of the source to be 𝑟 (cid:48) = 23.6 ± 0.3 mag
(calibrated for the Pan-STARRS catalog). The late-time host galaxy
observations were carried out on June 14, 2021, with the Hanle Faint
Object Spectrograph and Camera (HFOSC) mounted on the 2.0m
Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). Four images of exposure time
900 sec each in the 𝑅𝐶 band were recorded. No source was detected
to a magnitude limit of 22.9 mag (AB) in the stacked image.

The ﬁeld of GRB 201221D was also observed with the TIFR-
ARIES Near-Infrared Spectrograph (TANSPEC), one of the main
instruments of 3.6m DOT. We took ten consecutive frames in the
𝑅𝐶 band with an exposure time of 500 sec each on June 4, 2021.
The data pre-processing and photometry were performed in the same
manner as described above. In the stacked image, we did not detect
any source at the burst position to a magnitude limit of 23.2 mag
(AB).

3 RESULTS

This section presents the results obtained from analysing the prompt
emission of GRB 201221D and its host galaxy properties. Due to
the unavailability of suﬃcient X-ray and optical data, we could not
perform an afterglow analysis.

3.1 Spectral Hardness and Peak energy

The hardness ratio (HR) is calculated using the ratio of counts in
two energy channels (the 10 − 50 keV and 50 − 300 keV energy
bands) for the selected three NaI detectors. The HR is estimated
to be 2.68 ± 0.83, which is a typical value measured for SGRBs
(3.61 − 5.64 with a mean value of 4.61; Ohno et al. 2008). We plot
the 𝐸p - 𝑇90 distribution for all GRBs taken from the GBM catalog

in the lag-luminosity plane. GRB 201221D does not lie within the 2𝜎 region
(presented by dotted teal lines) of the lag-luminosity correlation. However,
GRB 200826A follows this correlation, which is generally true for long GRBs.

(Kienlin von et al. 2020). As described in §2.3 the value of 𝐸p for
GRB 201221D was calculated by a joint Fermi/GBM and Swift/BAT
spectral ﬁt. We ﬁt the 𝐸p - 𝑇90 distribution with a Bayesian Gaussian
Mixture Model (BGMM), which is a machine-learning clustering
algorithm generally used for classiﬁcation. We ﬁnd a probability of
98% for GRB 201221D to be a short burst. Fig. 5 shows the 𝐸p -
𝑇90 distribution along with the probability of a GRB being short.
The probability of GRB 200826A being an SGRB is 74% (Zhang
et al. 2021). However, recent analysis indicates a collapsar origin
for GRB 200826A (Ahumada et al. 2021; Rossi et al. 2021) unlike
SGRBs, which are proposed to come from compact object merg-
ers. Even though the probability of GRB 201221D belonging to the
SGRB population is quite high, concerning the recent developments
on GRB 200826A, we probe further to ascertain the classiﬁcation of
GRB 201221D.

3.2 Spectral lag

We calculate the spectral lag for GRB 201221D in diﬀerent energy
bands, selecting the range between 8−350 keV (a suﬃcient number of
counts are not available beyond 350 keV), considering the 8 − 30 keV
band as the reference channel. We estimate the temporal correlation
of the two light curves using the cross-correlation function (CCF) as
described in Bernardini et al. (2015). The maximum of the temporal
correlation provides the delay between two light curves. To ﬁnd the
global maximum, we ﬁt the correlation with an asymmetric Gaussian
function using emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). The spectral
lag in diﬀerent energy bands are quoted in Table 3 and the evolution
is shown in the top panel of Fig. 6.

An anti-correlation has been found between the bolometric peak
luminosity and the spectral lag of GRBs by Norris et al. (2000),
later conﬁrmed by Norris (2002); Gehrels et al. (2006); Ukwatta
et al. (2010). To put GRB 201221D in lag-luminosity correlation, we
calculate the lag between the two energy channels (15 − 25 keV and
50 − 100 keV) of Swift/BAT to compare (the same energy channels
used for the sample of GRBs deﬁned in Ukwatta et al. (2010)). The
lag between the BAT energy channels is 7±5 ms, close to zero within
errors.

The burst does not lie within the 2𝜎 region of the lag-luminosity
correlation, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 6. On the other hand,
the lag measured in GRB 200826A was 157 ms (Zhang et al. 2021),
and it falls within the lag-luminosity correlation, which is generally
true for long GRBs. It increases the ambiguity in the classiﬁcation
of GRB 200826A.

3.3 Non–Collapsar Probability

As discussed earlier, the origin of SGRBs belongs to old stellar pop-
ulations and is supposed to lie at low redshifts (Leibler & Berger
2010; Fong et al. 2013), but GRB 201221D lies at a high redshift
(𝑧 = 1.045) as compared to the median redshift of SGRBs. There-
fore, to check if GRB 201221D originated from a collapsar or not,
we estimate the non-collapsar probability ( 𝑓𝑛𝑐) using the functions
deﬁned in Bromberg et al. (2012, 2013):

The ﬁrst and the second term correspond to non-collapsars and
collapsars, respectively. 𝑇𝐵 is the observed breakout time in the
duration distribution. 𝐴𝑁 𝐶 and 𝐴𝐶 are the ﬁt parameters and are
taken from Bromberg et al. (2013) that they obtained by ﬁtting the
duration distributions to the collapsar distribution function.

Using 𝑇90 (Fermi/GBM ) for GRB 201221D, we estimate the 𝑓𝑛𝑐
value of 0.95 ± 0.09. For comparison, we also calculate the 𝑓𝑛𝑐 value
for GRB 200826A, which is 0.70 ± 0.01. The high probability of
a non-collapsar origin for GRB 201221D shows that it very likely
belongs to the non-collapsar progenitors.

3.4 Host Properties

The host galaxy of GRB 201221D was identiﬁed in the optical and
NIR bands with LBT in late-time observations (Agüí Fernández
et al. 2021). The host magnitudes are listed in Table 2. The available
magnitudes are used to investigate the host galaxy properties using
Prospector (Johnson et al. 2021). Prospector is a Python-based
stellar population modelling code which uses Flexible Stellar Popu-
lation synthesis (FSPS; Conroy et al. 2009; Conroy & Gunn 2010;
Conroy 2013) to build the stellar population models (Leja et al. 2017;
Johnson et al. 2021). It utilises Dynesty (Speagle 2020), a nested
sampling algorithm, to ﬁt the photometric and spectroscopic data of
a galaxy and provides the best-ﬁt solution and posterior parameter
distributions for the galaxy parameters. We used the best ﬁt to deter-
mine the stellar mass (𝑀), age of the galaxy (𝑡𝑔𝑎𝑙), star-formation
history (SFH), dust extinction (𝐴𝑉 ), and stellar metallicity (𝑍) us-
ing the methodology described in Johnson et al. (2021). We used the
milky way extinction law and Chabrier initial mass function (Cardelli
et al. 1989; Chabrier 2003) . We ﬁxed the redshift to 𝑧 = 1.045 (Agüí
Fernández et al. 2021) and ﬁtted for other parameters by setting the
priors as listed in Table 4. The maximum value of the age of the
galaxy is ﬁxed to 6.148 Gyr, the age of the Universe at the redshift
of the burst. The posterior distributions for the parameters produced
using Prospector are shown in the corner plots in Fig. 7. The pho-
tometric data of the host over-plotted with the model spectrum and
photometry is shown in Fig. 8. We found the best-ﬁt values for the pa-
rameters as listed in Table 4 with log evidence value of 148 ± 36. The
values of the host parameters are consistent with the values derived
in Agüí Fernández et al. (2021).

Further, we estimated the SFR using the relation:

SFR(𝑡) = 𝑀 ×

(cid:104) ∫ 𝑡

0

𝑡𝑒−𝑡/𝜏 𝑑𝑡

(cid:105) −1

× 𝑡𝑒−𝑡/𝜏 ,

where, 𝑀 is the total mass of the galaxy, 𝑡 is the age of the galaxy
and 𝜏 is star-formation timescale. The value of SFR is given in Table
4. This relatively high value of SFR is consistent with the detection
of O[II] emission from the host in the GTC spectrum.

REDSHIFT SGRBS?

Motivated by the fact that some of the SGRBs lying at a high redshift
(e.g., GRBs 200826A and 090426A) have signatures of collapsars
and earlier prediction by Berger et al. (2007) that there can be a new
population of SGRBs at higher redshifts, we examine the similarity
and diﬀerences between SGRBs at low and high redshifts.

the GRBs with 𝑇90,i < 2 sec as the SGRBs in our sample. The full
sample of 43 SGRBs is given in Table 5. We compared the redshift
distribution of SGRBs with that of long GRBs. Fig. 9 shows the red-
shift distribution of GRBs. We estimated the median redshift value
for SGRBs is 𝑧 = 0.47, which is lower than the estimated median
redshift value of long GRBs (𝑧 = 1.68). Considering the median

redshift of SGRBs, We divide the sample of SGRBs into two groups;
Group 1-low redshift SGRBs with 𝑧 < 0.7, and Group 2-high redshift
SGRBs with 𝑧 ≥ 0.7.

In this section, we present the comparison of prompt (prompt
emission correlations and 𝑓𝑛𝑐) properties, afterglow, and the host
properties of SGRBs lying at high and low redshifts.

4.1 Prompt emission properties

Prompt emission correlations have been used as tools to classify
GRBs for a long time. In the Amati correlation plane, 𝐸𝛾,iso - 𝐸p,i
(peak energy in the source frame) plane, two classes of GRBs lie
at diﬀerent positions following diﬀerent tracks (Amati et al. 2002;
Amati 2006). Using the ﬂuence value (1-1000 keV) and 𝐸p values
estimated in section 2.3, we calculate the isotropic energy release
and 𝐸p,i for GRB 201221D, 𝐸𝛾,iso = 2.762 × 1051 erg and 𝐸p,i =
226+31.8
−35.8.
We plot GRB 201221D in the Amati correlation plane along with
SGRBs of Group 1 and Group 2 and long GRBs (Fig. 10) using
the values of 𝐸𝛾,iso, 𝐸p,i from Minaev & Pozanenko (2020). The
dotted lines show the 2𝜎 correlation regions. GRB 201221D lies

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2021)

in the overlapping 2𝜎 regions of correlation of both short and long
GRBs. In the ﬁgure, we also highlight the position of GRB 200826A,
which follows the long GRB track. We also ﬁnd that some SGRBs at
𝑧 > 0.7 lie on the long GRB track and some in the overlapping 2𝜎
correlation region of short and long GRBs.

In addition, we calculate 𝐿𝛾,p,iso = 4.64 ± 0.84 × 1052 and put
GRB 201221D in the Yonetoku correlation plane (𝐿𝛾,p,iso-𝐸p,i)
along with the sample available from the literature (Yonetoku et al.
2004; Nava et al. 2012). The bottom panel of Fig. 10 shows the
location of the burst in the Yonetoku plane, GRB 201221D and
GRB 200826A lie within the 3𝜎 scatter of the sample of GRBs
studied by Nava et al. (2012).

We also compare the non-collapsar probability ( 𝑓𝑛𝑐) of
GRB 201221D and GRB 200826A with other SGRBs with a known
redshift from the sample of Bromberg et al. (2013). Fig. 11 shows
the 𝑓𝑛𝑐 for SGRBs lying at diﬀerent redshifts. These results indicate
that most of the SGRBs at high redshift (𝑧 > 1) have lower values of
𝑓𝑛𝑐, which is in agreement with the results of Bromberg et al. (2013),
indicating that these SGRBs might arise from progenitors other than
compact object mergers.

4.2 Multi-band SGRB afterglow light curves
We compare the optical (𝑅𝐶 /𝑟 (cid:48)) and X-ray (0.3 - 10 keV) afterglow
light curves of Group 1 and Group 2 SGRBs, as deﬁned earlier. We
construct the optical light curves of SGRB afterglows using the data
from Fong et al. (2015) up to 2015 and Rastinejad et al. (2021) for
bursts beyond 2015. The magnitudes are converted to ﬂux density
after correcting for galactic extinction for each burst.

The X-ray light curves, in units of ﬂux, in the energy range 0.3 −
10 keV, are taken from the Swift XRT repository10. The ﬂux light
curves are converted to luminosity to compare Group 1 and Group
2 SGRBs. Fig. 12 shows the comparison between optical and X-ray
light curves of Group 1 and Group 2 SGRBs. The optical light curves

along with GRB 201221D (this work) and GRB 200826A (Zhang
et al. 2021) color-coded with the redshift value. We notice that the
hosts of SGRBs lying at higher redshifts have higher SFR values than
those of SGRBs lying at lower redshifts. A recent study by Dichiara
et al. (2021) compared the SFRs of SGRB hosts at redshift 𝑧 > 1
with those of long GRBs at redshift 1 < 𝑧 < 2. Their study indicated
a signiﬁcant overlap in SFR and stellar masses between short and
long GRB hosts in this redshift range.

As SGRBs are supposed to originate from compact star mergers,
they are believed to be associated with an old population of galaxies
with low SFRs (Fong & Berger 2013; Berger 2014; Li et al. 2016). On
the other hand, long GRBs, expected to originate from massive star
collapsars, are generally found in star-forming galaxies with high
SFRs. The overlap between the SFRs of long and SGRB hosts at
redshift 𝑧 > 1 indicates they might have the same type of progenitor
system. However, we can not deny the fact that galaxy properties also
vary with redshift. In general, there is a steady decrease in the overall
SFR of the Universe by a factor of 10 from to z=1 to z=0 (Madau
et al. 1996; Bauer et al. 2005).

5 SUMMARY

We have presented the analysis of GRB 201221D and its comparison
with the SGRB sample. We determined the prompt emission param-
eters such as spectral hardness, lag, non-collapsar probability and
the host galaxy properties of the burst. We also performed the time-
resolved spectroscopy of the prompt emission of GRB 201221D and
compared the evolution with that of an SGRB sample from Burgess
et al. (2019). The ﬁt parameters, 𝐸p (peak energy), 𝛼 (spectral index)
and ﬂux show hard-to-soft evolution. The (𝛼 and ﬂux) lie well within
the usual range for the SGRB sample. The 𝐸p value is softer than the
SGRB sample and comparable to that of long GRBs.

As the 𝑇90 value depends on the sensitivity of an instrument and
the background variations, it alone can not decide the classiﬁcation
of a burst . It is essential to look for other properties that can be used
for classiﬁcation (Qin et al. 2000; Fenimore et al. 1995). We used
diﬀerent methods reported in the literature to conﬁrm the class of
GRB 201221D (Minaev & Pozanenko 2020; Dimple et al. 2022).
We calculated the probability of GRB 201221D being an SGRB

the plane are shown with magenta and blue diamond symbols, respectively.
GRB 200826A, along with some other SGRBs from Group 2 are seen to
follow the track of long GRBs. However, GRB 201221D lies in the overlapping
region of 2𝜎 tracks of long and SGRBs. Bottom: Yonetoku correlation for

show a wide range in brightness for SGRBs at diﬀerent redshifts.
However, the X-ray luminosities for SGRBs at high redshifts (Group
1) are systematically higher than those of SGRBs at lower redshifts.
However, It can also be because the faint bursts would not be detected
at high-redshifts, where only luminous bursts can be detectable.

GRB 201221D does not have good coverage in both optical and
X-ray bands. With the limited data GRB 201221D seems to lie at the
lower end of the luminosity distribution in optical and X-ray bands.

4.3 Host Properties

We compare the SFRs of the hosts of all SGRBs with known redshifts.
The SFR values are taken from Berger (2014) and Dichiara et al.
(2021). In Fig. 13 we plot the SFR and stellar mass of all SGRB hosts

by ﬁtting the 𝐸p -𝑇90 distribution with BGMM. The probability of
GRB 201221D is 98%, indicating that GRB 201221D very likely
belongs to SGRB class. Furthermore, we calculated the spectral lag
in diﬀerent energy bands, and the lag value is close to zero, as
expected for SGRBs. We placed the burst in the Amati correlation
plane. It lies in the overlapping region of short and long GRBs.

Furthermore, we compared the prompt (prompt emission corre-
lation and 𝑓𝑛𝑐), afterglow, and host properties of SGRBs lying at
high and low redshifts to address the implication of redshift on the
progenitor system of SGRBs. We found that:

(a) SGRBs with 𝑧 > 0.7 are located close to the long GRB track in
the Amati plane. Three SGRBs (including GRB 200826A) lie on the
long GRB track. Some of these SGRBs, including GRB 201221D lie
in the overlapping region of 2𝜎 regions of long and SGRBs.

(b) The non-collapsar probabilities for some high redshift SGRBs
have values < 0.5, indicating these SGRBs might result from collap-
sars.

(c) The optical brightness covers a wide range for SGRBs at dif-
ferent redshifts. However, the X-ray luminosities for SGRBs at high
redshifts are systematically higher than that of SGRBs at lower red-

(2021); Zhang et al. (2021) and this work. The SGRB hosts lying at higher
redshifts have relatively larger SFR values than those for low-redshift SGRB
hosts. GRB 201221D has an intermediate value compared to the sample of
SGRBs studied here.

shifts. Also, a fraction of high redshift SGRB hosts has large SFRs
comparable to those of long GRB hosts. However, this can be an
observational artefact.

The studies show that SGRBs lying at high redshifts have sim-
ilarities to long GRBs, indicating they might have progenitor sys-
tems other than compact object mergers (e.g. GRB 200826A and
GRB 090426), or there might exist subgroups within the SGRBs
originating through diﬀerent channels (Yu et al. 2018). The investi-
gation of SGRBs lying in the overlapping region can provide a clearer
picture of the progenitor systems of SGRBs.

Machine learning algorithms can play a crucial role to solve the
classiﬁcation conundrum (Jespersen et al. 2020; Dimple et al. 2022).
In addition, late-time optical and NIR observations in the future can
help to observe the bumps in the optical/NIR light curves in GRBs. It
will lead to identifying the bumps as supernovae/kilonovae, which are
uniquely associated with collapsars/compact binary mergers. How-
ever, it is diﬃcult to detect the kilonova/supernova transients at higher
redshifts due to the observational limitations and their faintness and
fast evolution. The observations by future telescopes like Extremely
Large Telescope (ELT), Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT), and Giant
Magellan Telescope (GMT) have the potential to detect kilonovae at
redshift > 1. In addition to optical observations, gravitational-wave
observations have immense potential to shed light on this problem.
However, only third-generation gravitational wave detectors such as
Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer (Sathyaprakash et al. 2012;
Evans et al. 2021; Kalogera et al. 2021) expected to be operational
in 2030+, will have the sensitivity to observe binary neutron stars at
redshifts around 1.
