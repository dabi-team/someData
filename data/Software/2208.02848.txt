Benchmarking the face-centred ﬁnite volume method
for compressible laminar ﬂows

Jordi Vila-P´erez1, Matteo Giacomini2,3,*, Antonio Huerta2,3

Abstract

Purpose - This study aims to assess the robustness and accuracy of the face-
centred ﬁnite volume (FCFV) method for the simulation of compressible laminar
ﬂows in diﬀerent regimes, using numerical benchmarks.
Design/methodology/approach - The work presents a detailed comparison
with reference solutions published in the literature –when available– and numerical
results computed using a commercial cell-centred ﬁnite volume software.
Findings - The FCFV scheme provides ﬁrst-order accurate approximations of the
viscous stress tensor and the heat ﬂux, insensitively to cell distortion or stretching.
The strategy demonstrates its eﬃciency in inviscid and viscous ﬂows, for a wide
range of Mach numbers, also in the incompressible limit. In purely inviscid ﬂows,
non-oscillatory approximations are obtained in the presence of shock waves. In the
incompressible limit, accurate solutions are computed without pressure correction al-
gorithms. The method shows its superior performance for viscous high Mach number
ﬂows, achieving physically admissible solutions without carbuncle eﬀect and predic-
tions of quantities of interest with errors below 5%.
Originality/value - The FCFV method accurately evaluates, for a wide range
of compressible laminar ﬂows, quantities of engineering interest, such as drag, lift
and heat transfer coeﬃcients, on unstructured meshes featuring distorted and highly
stretched cells, with an aspect ratio up to ten thousand. The method is suitable to
simulate industrial ﬂows on complex geometries, relaxing the requirements on mesh
quality introduced by existing ﬁnite volume solvers and alleviating the need for time-
consuming manual procedures for mesh generation to be performed by specialised
technicians.

Introduction

Despite the growing interest towards high-order methods for computational ﬂuid dynam-
ics (CFD) (Slotnick et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013; Huynh, Wang and Vincent, 2014;
Abgrall and Ricchiuto, 2017), ﬁnite volume (FV) approaches still represent the de facto
standard in the simulation of industrial ﬂows, aerodynamics, heat and mass transfer prob-
lems (Chalot, 2017). Such a success, stemming from the inherent conservation properties
of these techniques, their suitability for a wide range of ﬂow regimes and their eﬃciency
in simulating large-scale engineering systems, is testiﬁed by their widespread implementa-
tion in commercial, industrial and open-source software, including Ansys Fluent (ANSYS,
2017), OpenFOAM (Jasak, 2009), SU2 (Economon et al., 2016), NASA CFL3D (Bartels,
Rumsey and Biedron, 2006), NASA FUN3D (Biedron et al., 2019), FLITE (Morgan et al.,
1991; Sørensen et al., 2003b,a) and TAU (Gerhold, 2005), just to name a few.
The FV rationale relies on an integral formulation of the partial diﬀerential equations
under analysis, obtained via the appropriate positioning of the unknowns in the compu-
tational mesh and the deﬁnition of suitable inter-cell ﬂuxes to transfer the information
among neighbouring cells. The position of the unknowns yields a ﬁrst classiﬁcation of
FV approaches into the vertex-centred ﬁnite volume (VCFV) method, which deﬁnes the
degrees of freedom of the solution at the mesh nodes, and the cell-centred ﬁnite volume
(CCFV) rationale, locating the unknowns at the centroid of each cell (Eymard, Gallou¨et
and Herbin, 2000; Morton and Sonar, 2007; Leveque, 2013; Barth, Herbin and Ohlberger,
2017; Cardiﬀ and Demirdˇzi´c, 2021). More recently, a new FV paradigm, the so-called face-
centred ﬁnite volume (FCFV) method, was introduced by positioning the unknowns of the
system at the barycentre of each face and eliminating all the degrees of freedom within the
cells by means of a hybridisation procedure (Sevilla, Giacomini and Huerta, 2018, 2019;
Vieira et al., 2020; Giacomini and Sevilla, 2020; Vila-P´erez et al., 2022). To transmit the
necessary information across the interface between two neighbouring cells, suitable numer-
ical ﬂuxes are then deﬁned based on approximate Riemann solvers (LeVeque, 1992; Toro,
2009; Hesthaven, 2017).
One of the most appealing properties of the FCFV paradigm is its capability to handle
general unstructured meshes featuring diﬀerent cell types –triangles and quadrilaterals in
2D; tetrahedra, hexahedra, prisms and pyramids in 3D–, with possibly distorted and highly
stretched cells. Such ﬂexibility is especially relevant in the simulation of industrial problems
with complex geometries for which traditional FV schemes require dedicated mesh genera-
tion procedures, particularly expensive in terms of man-hours of specialised technicians, to
achieve grids with suﬃcient quality to be suitable for CFD simulations. Nonetheless, in or-
der to devise a competitive FV solver, robustness and accuracy in diﬀerent ﬂow conditions
are also critical. Hence, in this work, an extensive numerical study is presented to bench-
mark the approximation properties of the FCFV method in the simulation of compressible
laminar ﬂows. Of course, a thorough examination of the performance of the method in
the presence of turbulent eﬀects is crucial for industrial applications but it lies outside the
scope of this contribution. Indeed, this work presents a detailed comparison with existing
reference solutions published in the literature and the results provided by Ansys Fluent

CCFV solvers, with particular attention to the robustness and the accuracy of the FCFV
scheme in ﬁve challenging problems, involving:

P1. convergence properties in the presence of distorted cells;

P2. viscous laminar ﬂows, with highly stretched meshes in the boundary layer region;

P3. purely inviscid ﬂows, possibly featuring discontinuous solutions;

P4. nearly incompressible viscous laminar ﬂows, with velocity-pressure coupling eﬀects;

P5. viscous laminar ﬂows at high Mach number, with strong bow shocks.

The above cases are devised to address the most common diﬃculties faced by FV solvers
in the context of ﬂow problems and to submit the FCFV method to a stress test in order
to evaluate its performance in a wide variety of scenarios. Both qualitative analyses of
the physical variables and quantitative computations of aerodynamic coeﬃcients are pre-
sented. In particular, test P1 stems from the observation that traditional VCFV and CCFV
methods achieve second-order accurate approximations by means of a ﬂux reconstruction
procedure. Nonetheless, this step is strongly dependent on the quality of the mesh and the
accuracy of both approaches is known to deteriorate in the presence of distorted cells, lead-
ing to suboptimal approximations of the gradient of the solution (Diskin et al., 2010; Diskin
and Thomas, 2011). On the contrary, the FCFV method provides ﬁrst-order accuracy of
the gradient of the solution without any reconstruction step and it is thus insensitive to
cell distortion. Test P2 further extends this mesh sensitivity analysis by considering a set
of viscous laminar ﬂows where highly stretched cells, with an aspect ratio between 103 and
104, naturally arise in the discretisation of the boundary layer region. In addition, purely
inviscid ﬂows ranging from subsonic to supersonic conditions (test P3) are explored to
assess the capability of the FCFV method to represent both smooth and discontinuous so-
lutions. The main diﬃculty in these problems is to maintain physically admissible solutions
with positivity-preserving techniques and to avoid nonphysical oscillations in the vicinity
of steep gradients and discontinuities. This is particularly challenging in the absence of
the regularisation eﬀect of the viscous terms of the Navier-Stokes equations and the FCFV
method achieves such a result without resorting to artiﬁcial viscosity or slope limiters tech-
niques (Cockburn and Shu, 1989; Persson and Peraire, 2006; Huerta, Casoni and Peraire,
2012). Furthermore, test P4 analyses the low Mach number case and the challenge to
construct stable approximations of the velocity-pressure coupling arising in nearly incom-
pressible ﬂows. Contrary to traditional VCFV and CCFV schemes, the FCFV paradigm
is locking-free in the incompressible limit and it does not require the introduction of spe-
ciﬁc pressure correction algorithms such as the semi-implicit method for pressure linked
equations (SIMPLE) (Patankar and Spalding, 1972) or the pressure-implicit splitting op-
erator (PISO) (Issa, 1986). Finally, the robustness of the FCFV method in the presence of
strong bow shocks is studied for high Mach number ﬂows (test P5), where traditional FV
schemes tend to suﬀer from a loss of accuracy due to the carbuncle phenomenon and the
resulting solution is extremely sensitive to the quality of the computational mesh (Elling,
2009; Kitamura, Shima and Roe, 2012).

The article is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the compressible Navier-Stokes
equations and section 3 brieﬂy reviews the formulation of the FCFV approximation for
compressible ﬂows.
In section 4, an extensive set of benchmark tests is presented to
address the ﬁve challenging problems identiﬁed above. Special emphasis is devoted to
the comparison of the FCFV outcomes with reference solutions available in the literature
as well as the CCFV results yielded by the commercial CFD software Ansys Fluent. Finally,
the conclusions of this study are summarised in section 5.

2 Compressible Navier-Stokes equations

Let Ω ⊂ Rnsd be an open, bounded and connected domain in nsd dimensions, with boundary
∂Ω. Let tend > 0 be a ﬁnal time of interest. The unsteady nondimensional compressible
Navier-Stokes equations, expressed in conservation form, are given by

∂U
∂t

+ ∇ · (F (U ) − G(U , ∇U )) = 0

in Ω × (0, tend],

(1)

with appropriate boundary and initial conditions. Here, U ∈ Rnsd+2 is the vector of
conserved quantities and F and G are the advection and diﬀusion ﬂux tensors, respectively,
given by

U =



, G(U , ∇U ) =



 .

(2)

In these expressions, ρ denotes the density, v the velocity ﬁeld, E the total speciﬁc energy,
p the pressure, σd the viscous stress tensor and q the heat ﬂux vector, whereas Insd stands
for the nsd-dimensional identity matrix.
Under the assumption of ideal gas, the relation γp = (γ − 1)ρT stands, T being the
temperature ﬁeld and γ = cp/cv being the ratio of speciﬁc heats at constant pressure, cp,
and constant volume, cv. In particular, γ = 1.4 for air. For a calorically perfect gas, it also
holds that p = (γ − 1)ρ (E − (cid:107)v(cid:107)2/2). In addition, for a Newtonian ﬂuid under Stokes’
hypothesis and employing Fourier’s law of heat conduction, the viscous stress tensor σd
and the heat ﬂux vector q are given by

where µ is the dynamic viscosity and ∇S := (∇+∇T )/2 denotes the symmetric part of the

are deﬁned as

M∞ =

where c = (cid:112)γp/ρ stands for the speed of sound, L is a characteristic length, κ refers to
the thermal conductivity and (cid:3)∞ denotes the free-stream reference values. In particular,
Pr = 0.71 for air.

Finally, the Sutherland’s law is employed to model the nondimensional dynamic viscosity,
namely

µ =

(cid:18) T
T∞

(cid:19)3/2 T∞ + S
T + S

,

(5)

S = S0T∞/Tref being the Sutherland’s constant, with S0 = 110 K and Tref = 273 K,
whereas T∞ = 1/ [(γ − 1)M2

∞] denotes the nondimensional free-stream temperature.

3 FCFV approximation of compressible ﬂows

The FCFV method constructs an approximation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equa-
tions using a mixed formulation. Introducing two additional mixed variables, namely, the
deviatoric strain rate tensor εd and the gradient of temperature φ, equation (1) is rewritten
as the system of ﬁrst-order equations

It is worth noticing that the viscous stress tensor and the heat ﬂux vector can be easily
retrieved from the above mixed variables through simple linear expressions, that is

σd =

εd,

q =

φ.

(7)

For the sake of readability, equation (6a) will be henceforth represented as εd = D∇Sv,
with the linear operator D deﬁned as

DW = (cid:0)W + W T (cid:1) −

2
3

tr(W )I.

(8)

From equation (8), it follows that the deviatoric strain rate tensor can thus be expressed as
a function of the symmetric part of the gradient of the velocity. Moreover, Voigt notation
is employed to store only the non-redundant components of the second-order tensor as
detailed in (Vila-P´erez et al., 2022; Sevilla et al., 2018; Giacomini et al., 2018; Giacomini,
Sevilla and Huerta, 2020; La Spina, Giacomini and Huerta, 2020; La Spina et al., 2020;
Vila-P´erez et al., 2021).

3.1 Integral formulation
A partition of the domain Ω in nel disjoint cells Ωe, namely Ω = (cid:83)nel
e=1 Ωe, is considered
for the discretisation. The boundary ∂Ωe of the cell Ωe is obtained as the union of its

5

fa

e=1 ∂Ωe] \ ∂Ω.

j=1 Γe,j. In addition, the internal interface Γ is deﬁned as

fa faces Γe,j, that is, ∂Ωe := (cid:83)ne
ne
Γ := [(cid:83)nel
The FCFV solver is devised in two stages (Sevilla, Giacomini and Huerta, 2018) introducing
an additional hybrid unknown (cid:98)U , which denotes the vector of conservative variables on
the mesh faces Γ ∪ ∂Ω. In the ﬁrst step, the system of equations (6) is discretised using a
constant approximation of the conservative and mixed variables (U , εd, φ) in each cell Ωe,
e = 1, . . . , nel, to express them as functions of (cid:98)U . To this end, given the initial condition
U = U 0 at time t = 0 and the boundary condition U = (cid:98)U on ∂Ωe, the divergence
theorem is applied to the system of equations (6) yielding the integral form of the FCFV
local problem

where n is the outward normal vector to the cell face. In the above equations, the velocity
(cid:98)v and the temperature (cid:98)T on the cell faces forming ∂Ωe are computed from the vector (cid:98)U
denote the convection
of the conservative variables on the faces. Moreover, F n
and the diﬀusion numerical ﬂuxes, respectively.
The solution of equations (9) allows to eliminate the cell unknowns associated with (U , εd, φ)
by expressing them in terms of the face unknowns (cid:98)U . The second step of the FCFV
method requires the computation of (cid:98)U , which is discretised employing a constant value at
the barycentre of the faces. The FCFV global problem thus prescribes the continuity of
the normal ﬂuxes on the internal faces Γ and the boundary conditions on ∂Ω, namely

Inter-cell numerical ﬂuxes

The traces of the FCFV convective and diﬀusive inter-cell numerical ﬂuxes (Sevilla, Gia-
comini and Huerta, 2018, 2019; Vieira et al., 2020; Giacomini and Sevilla, 2020; Vila-P´erez
et al., 2022) are expressed as

G(U , εd, φ)n

= F ( (cid:98)U )n + τ a( (cid:98)U ) (U − (cid:98)U ),
= G( (cid:98)U , εd, φ)n − τ d (U − (cid:98)U ),

(11a)

(11b)

where τ a and τ d denote the stabilisation tensors associated with the convective and the
viscous eﬀects, respectively.

6

Diﬀerent approximate Riemann solvers can be devised for the FCFV method depending on
the deﬁnition of τ a (Vila-P´erez et al., 2021). In particular, the HLL (Harten, Lax and van
Leer, 1983) and HLLEM (Einfeldt, 1988; Einfeldt et al., 1991) Riemann solvers employed
in this study yield the stabilisation tensors

HLL = s+Insd+2,
τ a

HLLEM = s+θ( (cid:98)U ),
τ a

(12)

where s+ := max(0, (cid:98)v · n + (cid:98)c) is an estimate of the largest wave speed of the Riemann
problem and the matrix θ( (cid:98)U ) = RΘR−1 is constructed starting from the spectral decom-
position of the Jacobian An( (cid:98)U ) := [∂F ( (cid:98)U )/∂ (cid:98)U ]n of the convective ﬂuxes in the normal
direction to the cell face. In this context, R denotes the matrix of the right eigenvectors
of An( (cid:98)U ) = RΛR−1, Λ stands for the diagonal matrix of the corresponding eigenvalues,
whereas Θ is the diagonal matrix given by Θ = diag
, with (cid:98)θ = |(cid:98)v ·n|/(cid:98)λmax (Ro-
hde, 2001). Finally, the stabilisation tensor τ d of the viscous ﬂuxes is deﬁned as the
diagonal matrix

3.1.2

Imposition of the boundary conditions

The trace boundary operator (cid:98)B(U , (cid:98)U , εd, φ) is responsible for introducing appropriate
boundary conditions in the integral equation (10). Equation (14) details the expression of
this operator for the most common types of boundary conditions in aerodynamic applica-
tions involving compressible ﬂows, namely

n ( (cid:98)U )(U∞ − (cid:98)U ),

n ( (cid:98)U )(U − (cid:98)U ) + A−

(cid:98)B = A+
(cid:98)B = {ρ, ρvT , pout/(γ − 1) + ρ(cid:107)v(cid:107)2/2}T − (cid:98)U

In these expressions, far-ﬁeld boundary conditions (also used for subsonic inlets, supersonic
inlets and supersonic outlets) exploit the spectral decomposition of the matrix An( (cid:98)U ) via
its positive and negative characteristics given by A±
n := (An ± |An|)/2, see equation (14a).
In addition, U∞, pout and Tw represent the free-stream data for the conservative variables,
the outlet pressure and the wall temperature, respectively, whereas 0nsd stands for an nsd-
dimensional vector of zeros. Finally, for the adiabatic wall in equation (14c), the thermal
conductivity (cid:98)κ = (cid:98)µ/(RePr) is computed as a function of the hybrid state (cid:98)U and the
ρE for the energy equation is given by τ d

3.2 The FCFV solver

To construct the FCFV solver for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, the integral
equations (9) and (10) are approximated using a quadrature rule employing one integration
point per cell/face.
Let Ae be the set of all the faces of cell Ωe, Ie the set of its internal faces and Ee the set
of its external faces, that is,

Ae := {1, . . . , ne

fa},

Ie := {j ∈ Ae | Γe,j ∩ Γ (cid:54)= ∅},

Ee := Ae \ Ie.

(15)

Furthermore, denote by χIe and χEe the indicator functions associated with the sets Ie and
Ee, respectively.
From (9), the local problems of the FCFV solver yield: given the initial condition Ue = U 0
e
at t = 0 and the trace variable (cid:98)Uj on the faces Γe,j, j = 1, . . . , ne
e, φe) in
each cell Ωe, e = 1, . . . , nel such that

(16b)

(16c)

It is worth noticing that this step is independent cell-by-cell, computationally inexpensive
and it can be easily performed in parallel. More precisely, equations (16a) and (16b) only
involve a scaled identity matrix, whereas equation (16c) requires to solve for Ue one linear
system of dimension nsd + 2, namely,

|Ωe|

dUe

+ Ce( (cid:98)U)Ue = Re( (cid:98)U),

(17)

where Ue and (cid:98)U are the vectors containing the conservative variables at the centroid of
the cell and at the barycentres of the faces, respectively, whereas Ce and Re are the matrix
and vector obtained by the FCFV discretisation of

Ce( (cid:98)U) :=

(18b)

Finally, an appropriate time integration scheme is required to derive the fully-discrete form
of the local problems (Hairer, Nørsett and Wanner, 2000; Jaust and Sch¨utz, 2014; Komala-
Sheshachala, Sevilla and Hassan, 2020; Sevilla, 2021). Since the present study focuses

8

on steady-state ﬂows, this term is henceforth neglected. Alternatively, a time marching
scheme based on an artiﬁcial pseudo-time could be considered as a relaxation approach to
speed-up the convergence of the nonlinear global problem detailed below.
From the nel local problems (16), the expressions of the primal and mixed variables in each
cell Ωe as functions of the hybrid unknowns on the faces Γe,j, j = 1, . . . , ne
fa are exploited
to rewrite the FCFV global problem. More precisely, from (10) it follows that the second
step of the FCFV solver is: for all i ∈ Ae, compute (cid:98)Ui that satisﬁes

nel(cid:88)

e=1

|Γe,i|

(cid:110)(cid:104)

F ( (cid:98)Ui)ni − G( (cid:98)Ui, εd

χIe(i)

+ (cid:98)B(U , (cid:98)U , εd, φ)χEe(i)

(cid:111)

= 0.

(19)

Equation (19) can thus be reformulated using only the face unknowns yielding the nonlinear
problem

nel(cid:88)

e=1

(cid:98)Re( (cid:98)U) = 0,

(20)

(cid:98)Re being the residual vector obtained from the FCFV discretisation of the contribution of
cell Ωe to the global problem. The resulting equation (20) is linearised using the Newton-
Raphson algorithm.
In this context, it is important to observe that the expressions of
Ue, εd
e and φe in terms of (cid:98)U , yielded by the FCFV local problems in each cell, are highly
nonlinear, whence the computation of the Jacobian matrix for equation (20) entails the
diﬀerentiation of both the local and global FCFV operators appearing in equations (16)
and (19).

4 Numerical benchmarks for the FCFV method

This section presents a comprehensive set of numerical benchmarks of viscous and inviscid
compressible ﬂows to showcase the capability of the FCFV method to provide accurate and
robust results in a wide variety of ﬂow conditions. The performance of the FCFV scheme is
compared to reference solutions published in the literature and to the ﬁrst and second-order
CCFV results provided by the commercial CFD software Ansys Fluent (ANSYS, 2017).

4.1 Convergence study for the compressible Taylor-Couette ﬂow

The ﬁrst test case considers a compressible Taylor-Couette ﬂow (Welsh, Kersal´e and Jones,
2014; Manela and Frankel, 2007), describing the motion of a viscous ﬂuid conﬁned between
two rotating cylinders with isothermal walls. This example has been subject of thorough
study in the literature (Chandrasekhar, 1981; Chossat and Iooss, 1994; Sevilla et al., 2020;
Giacomini, Sevilla and Huerta, 2021) since, under certain conditions, the ﬂow develops a
series of instabilities that break the symmetry of the problem and generate an unsteady

9

behaviour (Hatay et al., 1993; Kao and Chow, 1992). The setup considered in this study
avoids the instabilities and consists of a ﬂow at low Reynolds number, with angular sym-
metry and no radial velocity, that is, vr = 0. The exact solution can be obtained analyti-
cally upon integration of the Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates, once the
corresponding terms and angular derivatives are dismissed. This leads to the system of
diﬀerential equations

In the case under analysis, a domain with radii R0 = 1 and R1 = 2 is considered. The
ﬂow, featuring a constant viscosity, is deﬁned by Ω0 = 0, Ω1 = 0.5, T1 = 1/ [(γ − 1)M2
∞]
and T0 = 2T1. Moreover, the values of the Mach and the Reynolds numbers are set to
M∞ = 0.5 and Re = 100. Note that the latter is computed using a characteristic length
L = R1 − R0, with a characteristic velocity based on the conditions at the outer boundary.
This example is used to evaluate the accuracy properties of the FCFV method using both
regular and distorted meshes. The results are also compared to a numerical solution
computed using the second-order density-based CCFV scheme available in Ansys Fluent.
First, a set of structured regular grids of triangular cells is considered, see ﬁgures 1a–1b.
Additionally, a second set of meshes, displayed in ﬁgures 1c–1d, is employed to evaluate
the sensitivity of the method to cell distortion. The distorted meshes are constructed by
randomly perturbing the position xi of the interior nodes of the regular meshes. The
resulting perturbed nodes are ˜xi = xi + ri, where ri is a vector of dimension nsd with
random components in the interval [−(cid:96)min/3, (cid:96)min/3], (cid:96)min denoting the characteristic edge
length of the regular mesh.

4.1.1 Convergence study on regular meshes

The case is ﬁrst solved employing regular grids composed by 16 × 16, 32 × 32, 64 × 64,
128 × 128 and 256 × 256 cells. The FCFV solution for the nondimensional density, velocity,
temperature and pressure ﬁelds on the ﬁnest mesh is depicted in ﬁgure 2, showing the
radial dependency of the physical quantities.
The accuracy of the FCFV approximation is evaluated by means of an h-convergence study
of the L2(Ω) error of the variables of the system and the results are also compared to the
outcome of a CCFV simulation. The convergence history of the primitive variables, namely
density, velocity, temperature and pressure, is reported in table 1. On the one hand, the
FCFV method provides ﬁrst-order accuracy for density, velocity and temperature, whereas
pressure converges with a slightly suboptimal rate. On the other hand, Ansys Fluent
displays second-order accuracy for velocity and temperature, whereas density and pressure

are approximated with ﬁrst order. In addition, it is worth noticing that in this case the
FCFV results slightly outperform the CCFV approximation by Ansys Fluent in terms of
the accuracy of density and pressure ﬁelds.
It is important to remark that the momentum and the energy equations in the compressible
Navier-Stokes system feature second-order derivatives of the velocity and the temperature.
In this context, the ﬂux reconstruction performed by CCFV methods is responsible for the
accuracy gain shown by Ansys Fluent in table 1 for velocity and temperature. Nonetheless,
the mass continuity equation is a ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equation, whence the ﬂux
reconstruction is not providing additional accuracy in the approximation of the density

12

(nor of any derived variable such as the pressure) and its convergence is only ﬁrst order.
Given the critical role of the density in the computation of the conservative variables, ta-
ble 2 reports the convergence history for momentum and energy. For the FCFV method,

conservative variables are the primal variables of computation and ﬁrst-order accuracy is
achieved for both momentum and energy. The corresponding approximations computed
using Ansys Fluent do not inherit the second-order convergence property of velocity and
temperature previously observed and only ﬁrst-order accuracy is achieved. Moreover, sim-
ilarly to the previous result, the FCFV solution slightly outperforms the accuracy of the
energy approximation computed by means of Ansys Fluent.
Finally, the accuracy of the approximation of the stress tensor and the heat ﬂux is presented
in table 3. In this case, ﬁrst-order accuracy is obtained by the FCFV approximation for
both quantities. Regarding the CCFV solution by Ansys Fluent, the heat ﬂux converges
with a rate above one, providing an approximation more accurate than the FCFV method.
Nonetheless, the convergence rate of the stress tensor rapidly deteriorates and only a
suboptimal convergence rate of 0.5 is achieved.

4.1.2 Convergence study on distorted meshes

The convergence study presented in the previous section is now repeated using the set of
perturbed meshes. Figure 3 displays the temperature ﬁeld obtained on the second mesh
reﬁnement of the regular and the distorted meshes, using both the FCFV method and
Ansys Fluent second-order CCFV scheme. In all cases, the results are comparable, with a
slight tendency of Ansys Fluent to present abrupt variations of the solution cell-by-cell.

Figure 3: Compressible Taylor-Couette ﬂow – Temperature ﬁeld obtained with the FCFV
method and the second-order CCFV scheme by Ansys Fluent on the second grid reﬁnement
of the regular and distorted meshes.

The convergence of the L2(Ω) error for the primitive variables (density, velocity, temper-
ature and pressure), the conservative variables (momentum and energy) and the stress
tensor and the heat ﬂux are reported in tables 4, 5 and 6, respectively.
First of all, the FCFV scheme maintains the ﬁrst-order accuracy in the approximation
of both the primitive variables (i.e., density, velocity, temperature and pressure) in ta-
ble 4 and the conservative variables (i.e., momentum and energy) in table 5, even in the
presence of cell distortion. Similarly, the CCFV approximation computed using Ansys
Fluent maintains the ﬁrst-order accuracy for density and pressure (cf. table 4), as well
as for momentum and energy (cf. table 5). Nonetheless, the second-order convergence of
velocity and temperature observed on regular grids (cf. table 1) is lost in this case and
only ﬁrst-order accuracy is achieved for these variables, conﬁrming the sensitivity of the
reconstruction strategy of CCFV methods to the quality of the employed meshes (Diskin
et al., 2010; Diskin and Thomas, 2011).
Finally, the convergence history in table 6 conﬁrms the robustness of the FCFV method to
mesh distortion, with almost ﬁrst-order accuracy achieved by both the stress tensor and
the heat ﬂux. On the contrary, Ansys Fluent CCFV scheme shows a suboptimal behaviour
in the approximation of these quantities, with a convergence rate stagnating around 0.4
for both variables.
The results of the Taylor-Couette ﬂow demonstrate the accuracy properties of the FCFV
method and its robustness to diﬀerent meshes types. Indeed, the method provides ﬁrst-
order accuracy for all the ﬂow variables (primitive and conservative), as well as for the
viscous stress tensor and the heat ﬂux, using both regular and distorted meshes. This

is in contrast with the results provided by Ansys Fluent. Although the CCFV method
outperforms the FCFV scheme on regular grids achieving second-order accuracy for velocity
and temperature, the remaining quantities (density, pressure, momentum, energy and heat
ﬂux) only converge with order one and the viscous stress tensor experiences a suboptimal
behaviour. In addition the CCFV scheme by Ansys Fluent displays a strong sensitivity to
mesh distortion, with a deterioration of the convergence order of velocity and temperature
to order one and of the viscous stress tensor and the heat ﬂux to order 0.4 in the presence
of perturbed meshes.

4.2 Viscous laminar ﬂow cases over a NACA 0012 aerofoil

A set of viscous laminar ﬂows over a NACA 0012 aerofoil is studied next. Three diﬀerent
cases corresponding to subsonic (Swanson and Langer, 2016; Bassi and Rebay, 1997a;
Mavriplis and Jameson, 1990), transonic (Cambier, 1987) and supersonic viscous laminar
ﬂows at zero angle of attack are analysed, imposing adiabatic wall conditions on the aerofoil
surface. The ﬂow conditions are described in table 7. The purpose of these tests is to
examine the capability of the FCFV method to provide accurate results of aerodynamic
quantities of interest in various ﬂow conditions, comparing them with reference numerical
solutions available in the literature and with the outcome of ﬁrst and second-order CCFV
simulations using Ansys Fluent. Of course, given the viscous nature of the ﬂows under
analysis, non-uniform meshes with highly stretched cells in the boundary layer region are
employed.

A C-type computational domain is considered, with the far-ﬁeld boundary located at least
at 15 chord units from the aerofoil. A set of four structured meshes consisting of 128 × 128,
256 × 256, 512 × 512 and 1, 024 × 1, 024 quadrilateral cells is employed. Figure 4 displays
the four meshes with a close-up view near the aerofoil, highlighting the reﬁnement in the
boundary layer region, with an aspect ratio between 103 and 104. Moreover, additional
reﬁnement is introduced near the leading and trailing edges in order to capture the high
gradients of the ﬂow and to avoid numerical issues due to the geometric singularity. The
FCFV approximation of the Mach number distribution around the aerofoil is depicted in
ﬁgure 5.
In order to evaluate the accuracy of the FCFV method in predicting the pressure and the
viscous contributions of the aerodynamic forces, the pressure and skin friction coeﬃcients

obtained with the ﬁnest mesh are presented in ﬁgure 6 for the three diﬀerent cases. Avail-
able reference solutions of these coeﬃcients for the subsonic (Swanson and Langer, 2016)
and transonic (Cambier, 1987) examples are included for comparison, as well as the results
provided by Ansys Fluent CCFV solvers. In the three cases, only minimal diﬀerences are
observed among the FCFV and the CCFV results and all numerical solutions are in ex-
cellent agreement with the references available in the literature. These results certify the
robustness of the FCFV scheme, even in the presence of highly stretched meshes. More-
over, they showcase the capability of the method to accurately predict relevant metrics in
viscous laminar ﬂows, highlighting its competitiveness with respect to existing commercial
CCFV solvers.
To quantitatively compare the accuracy of the numerical schemes under analysis, the mesh
convergence of the pressure and the viscous contributions of the drag coeﬃcient computed
using the FCFV and Ansys Fluent ﬁrst and second-order CCFV methods is presented in
table 8. The results display only minor diﬀerences among the methods, all showing good
agreement with the reference values available in the literature. In particular, Ansys Fluent

second-order CCFV scheme achieves convergence even on coarse meshes and it provides
accurate approximations of both the individual contributions –when available– and the
total drag force. The predictions computed using the FCFV and the ﬁrst-order CCFV
method also match the reference value of the total drag force. Nonetheless, comparing the
estimated pressure drags in the subsonic case with the value determined by the second-
order scheme, FCFV underpredicts this quantity, whereas the ﬁrst-order CCFV tends to
overestimate the result. It is worth noticing that the error introduced by the two methods
is comparable, with a discrepancy of approximately 30 drag counts in both cases. Finally,
the results for the viscous drag in the subsonic case display a higher accuracy of the ﬁrst-
order CCFV scheme by Ansys Fluent which shows a closer behaviour to the second-order
scheme than the FCFV method.

The presented viscous laminar ﬂow cases show the robustness of the FCFV scheme in
a variety of ﬂow conditions, from subsonic to supersonic regime, even in the presence
of meshes with high aspect ratio. Moreover, the method displays good performance in
predicting relevant aerodynamic quantities matching the accuracy of Ansys Fluent ﬁrst-
order CCFV scheme. In this context, the second-order CCFV method outperforms the
FCFV approximation, showing superior accuracy when coarser meshes are employed.

4.3 Inviscid ﬂow cases over a NACA 0012

In this section, three cases of inviscid ﬂow over a NACA 0012 aerofoil at diﬀerent angles
of attack are presented, in subsonic (Sevilla, Hassan and Morgan, 2013; Nogueira et al.,
2009), transonic (Sevilla, Hassan and Morgan, 2013; Thibert, Granjacques and Ohman,
1979; Balan, Woopen and May, 2015; Balan et al., 2012; Yano and Darmofal, 2012) and
supersonic (Balan, Woopen and May, 2015; Persson and Peraire, 2006) regimes. The
details of the ﬂow conditions are presented in table 9. The objective of these tests is to
assess the robustness of the FCFV method in purely inviscid ﬂows, ranging from smooth to
discontinuous solutions with shocks, and to compare the results with high-order reference
solutions and CCFV results computed using Ansys Fluent.

The aerofoil is embedded in a computational domain which extends up to 15 chord lengths
from the surface.
Inviscid wall conditions are imposed on the aerofoil surface, whereas
far-ﬁeld conditions are enforced on the outer boundary by means of the Riemann solver.
The unstructured mesh designed for inviscid ﬂow simulations is depicted in ﬁgure 7 and
it consists of 712,614 triangular cells, with non-uniform reﬁnement on the surface of the
aerofoil and at the leading and trailing edges.

On the contrary, the CCFV method by Ansys Fluent shows an excellent behaviour in sim-
ulating the subsonic ﬂow but it suﬀers in the transonic and supersonic cases, see ﬁgure 9.
More precisely, both approaches struggle to achieve a steady-state solution and localised
oscillations appear, especially in the vicinity of strong shock waves and when the second-
order scheme is employed, as visible in ﬁgure 9f. Such a diﬃculty of the second-order
CCFV method to compute a smooth approximation is responsible for both the deterio-
ration of the convergence of the solver and the overall loss of quality of the ﬂowﬁeld (cf.
ﬁgure 9c). The ﬁrst-order CCFV approach remedies some of the above issues and it dis-
plays reasonable performance, with smoother approximation of the contour lines of the
Mach number distribution in both the transonic and the supersonic case. Nonetheless,
ﬁgure 9e shows that slight perturbations and instabilities are still present along the stag-
nation line of the supersonic ﬂow, in the region between the bow shock and the leading
edge. On the contrary, the FCFV method is able to provide a smooth representation of
the ﬂowﬁeld in all regimes. In addition, it is worth noticing that the contour lines of the
Mach number distribution computed using Ansys Fluent solvers tend to experience a very
localised variation near the wall, as opposed to the clear intersection with the wall surface
shown by the FCFV solution in ﬁgure 9a. In this ﬁgure, it can also be appreciated the
ability of the FCFV method to capture the weak shock on the lower side of the aerofoil,
which is not detected by the CCFV solvers.
In order to assess the accuracy of the FCFV method in evaluating aerodynamic quantities
of interest, ﬁgure 10 depicts the pressure coeﬃcient obtained for the three inviscid ﬂows
under analysis, comparing it with available reference solutions and Ansys Fluent CCFV
results. In all cases, the FCFV solution provides a smooth approximation of the pressure
coeﬃcient, whereas the ﬁrst and second-order CCFV approaches present an oscillatory
description of −Cp. Moreover, in both the subsonic and the supersonic case, the FCFV
curve lies on top of the ﬁrst and second-order solutions provided by Ansys Fluent, which
show only minor diﬀerences from one another. Concerning the subsonic case in ﬁgure 10a,
the FCFV approximation also displays excellent agreement with the reference solution
computed using a high-order FV scheme (Nogueira et al., 2009). Figure 10b reports the
more complex transonic regime. In this case, all tested FV methods are unable to accurately
capture the position of the weak shock, as testiﬁed by the comparison with the high-order
reference solution in (Sevilla, Hassan and Morgan, 2013). Concerning the approximation
of the strong shock on the upper surface of the aerofoil, the FCFV method shows good
agreement with a reference solution computed with polynomial approximation of degree
1 on a mesh of 533, 072 elements (Sevilla, Hassan and Morgan, 2013). Nonetheless, a
discrepancy is observed when the pressure coeﬃcient is compared to a high-order reference
distribution obtained using polynomial approximation of degree 3 on a mesh of 32,742
elements. This is a well-known issue due to the role of geometric error in the production of
nonphysical entropy and the need for accurate geometry approximation (Bassi and Rebay,
It is worth noticing that in the

transonic case, the ﬁrst and second-order CCFV solvers only present minor diﬀerences
from one another and they both provide a more accurate prediction of the position of the
strong shock wave than the FCFV scheme, although they tend to estimate a more vertical

A more quantitative assessment is reported in table 10, with a comparison of the computed
drag and lift coeﬃcients with high-order reference solutions. It is worth noticing that the
ﬁrst and second-order CCFV solvers provide almost identical outcomes in all cases, con-
ﬁrming the strong similarity of the corresponding pressure coeﬃcient curves observed in
ﬁgure 10. The results display that the FCFV method is capable of providing accurate
predictions of the drag coeﬃcient in all cases, whereas it yields larger errors in the approx-
imation of the lift coeﬃcient. More precisely, the Cd prediction lies within the interval of
reference values for the transonic case, see (Sevilla, Hassan and Morgan, 2013; Thibert,
Granjacques and Ohman, 1979; Balan, Woopen and May, 2015; Balan et al., 2012; Yano
and Darmofal, 2012), whereas in the supersonic case an error of only 6 drag counts (i.e.,
0.6%) is achieved with respect to the unique reference (Balan, Woopen and May, 2015).
Concerning the lift coeﬃcient, the FCFV scheme introduces an error of 25-28 and 32-40
lift counts in the subsonic and transonic case, respectively. On the contrary, the CCFV
solutions tend to experience larger errors in the approximation of the drag coeﬃcient and
increased accuracy in the Cl predictions. On the one hand, the errors in the Cd span
from 36-50 drag counts for the transonic case (Sevilla, Hassan and Morgan, 2013; Thibert,
Granjacques and Ohman, 1979; Balan, Woopen and May, 2015; Balan et al., 2012; Yano
and Darmofal, 2012) to 19 drag counts (i.e., 2%) for the supersonic case (Balan, Woopen
and May, 2015). On the other hand, the Cl predictions lie within the interval of reference
values for the subsonic case and overestimate the reference by 13-21 lift counts for the
transonic case. Finally, the drag coeﬃcient in the subsonic case and the lift coeﬃcient in
the supersonic case have zero reference value and can thus be interpreted as measures of the
approximation error. In this context, although the FCFV and the CCFV methods provide
comparable results in the subsonic case with a precision of order 10−3, the FCFV method
clearly outperforms Ansys Fluent solvers in the supersonic case providing a solution two
orders of magnitude more accurate than the CCFV schemes.

The test cases discussed above conﬁrm the robustness of the FCFV scheme across a wide
range of regimes of inviscid ﬂows and a particular superiority of the method with respect to
Ansys Fluent CCFV solvers in supersonic ﬂows with strong shocks. On the contrary, the
CCFV schemes showcase superior performance in the subsonic case with smooth solutions.
For the transonic regime, a clear conclusion cannot be drawn since the FCFV method
provides a more accurate prediction of the drag coeﬃcient, whereas the CCFV approaches
are more precise in estimating the lift coeﬃcient. Moreover, it is worth remarking that
the ﬁrst and second-order CCFV methods provide extremely similar performance in the
simulation of inviscid ﬂows, when there is no inﬂuence of the second-order terms in the
governing equations.

4.4 Nearly incompressible viscous laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate

In this section, the viscous laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate at zero angle of attack with
M∞ = 0.1 and Re = 105 (Blasius, 1908; Schlichting and Gersten, 2016) is analysed to
assess the robustness and the accuracy of the FCFV method in the nearly incompressible
limit, benchmarking the results using Blasius’ law and comparing the performance with
Ansys Fluent pressure-based CCFV solver.
An adiabatic ﬂat plate of length 2.5L, L being the characteristic length of the problem, is
embedded in the rectangular domain in ﬁgure 11. A symmetry condition is imposed up-
stream of the leading edge, whereas the top boundary is modelled by means of a far-ﬁeld
condition in Ansys Fluent, imposing the free-stream Mach number M∞, and a pressure
outﬂow in the FCFV method, setting the corresponding free-stream pressure p∞. Finally,
subsonic inﬂow and pressure outﬂow conditions are prescribed on the left and right bound-
aries, respectively. In particular, the condition at the inlet is enforced via the Riemann
solver and the pressure p∞ guarantees a zero pressure drop at the outlet.

Figure 11: Nearly incompressible viscous laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate – Domain and boundary
conditions.

The structured mesh of quadrilateral cells and the unstructured mesh of triangles displayed
in ﬁgure 12 are employed for this study. In both cases, the size of the ﬁrst layer of cells
is of order 10−4 < Re−3/4, with an aspect ratio of approximately 100. The resulting
structured grid in ﬁgure 12a consists of 80,500 cells, with a uniform stretching in the
normal direction to the plate and towards the leading edge, as shown in ﬁgures 12c and 12d.
Figure 12b depicts the unstructured mesh composed by 101,751 triangular cells: it features
a structured region in the boundary layer (Fig. 12e), whereas a speciﬁc reﬁnement is

in ﬁgure 12f.

leading edge regions.

The skin friction coeﬃcient along the ﬂat plate is compared to the reference value given by
the analytical boundary layer solution by Blasius for incompressible ﬂows (Blasius, 1908).
The results in ﬁgure 13 show that both the FCFV method and the second-order CCFV
scheme by Ansys Fluent provide an accurate description of the viscous boundary layer
using the structured grid. More precisely, almost comparable accuracy is achieved by the
two approaches, with the CCFV method slightly outperforming the FCFV scheme in the
neighbourhood of the leading edge. Using the unstructured mesh, the FCFV method is
still able to compute a reasonable approximation of the skin friction coeﬃcient, although
some oscillations appear in the region following the leading edge. Indeed, the unstructured
nature of the mesh in this region is responsible for the distance between the centroid of
the ﬁrst layer of cells and the plate to be non-uniform. Since the skin friction coeﬃcient is
computed using the mixed variable, deﬁned at the centroid of the cells, and this information
is not extrapolated to the boundary, slight oscillations appear in this area. On the contrary,
Ansys Fluent second-order CCFV scheme is unable to converge to a stable steady-state
solution on the unstructured mesh, showing the diverging oscillatory behaviour reported in
ﬁgure 13 for a ﬁxed iteration. In order to remedy this issue, the Ansys Fluent solver resorts
to the SIMPLE algorithm, introducing a velocity-pressure splitting to achieve convergence.
Nonetheless, the solution obtained in this case overestimates the skin friction coeﬃcient,
approximately by one order of magnitude.
The results of the ﬂow over a ﬂat plate show the robustness of the FCFV solver in the
incompressible limit, independently of the cell type and the quality of the employed mesh.
The FCFV scheme is able to provide an accurate approximation of aerodynamic quantity
of interest in all tested cases, whereas the CCFV method by Ansys Fluent is restricted to
structured meshes of quadrilaterals. More precisely, the CCFV solver is unable to converge

25

Figure 13: Nearly incompressible viscous laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate – Skin friction coeﬃcient
along the ﬂat plate, obtained for the FCFV and the CCFV methods by Ansys Fluent.

to a steady-state solution when the unstructured mesh is employed, requiring a pressure
correction based on the SIMPLE algorithm. Nonetheless, the results provided by Ansys
Fluent in this case display an error of one order of magnitude with respect to Blasius’
reference solution.

4.5 Supersonic viscous laminar ﬂow over a cylinder

The ﬁnal test case considers the supersonic viscous laminar ﬂow over a cylinder at M∞ =
4 and Re = 104 (Barter and Darmofal, 2007). This example represents a particularly
challenging benchmark for viscous compressible ﬂow solvers due to the presence of a strong
bow shock, together with a thin boundary layer producing important heat transfer eﬀects
near the cylinder wall.
The domain features a half-cylinder of radius L (the characteristic length of the problem),
with isothermal boundary conditions imposing a wall temperature of 2.5 times the free-
stream temperature. Far-ﬁeld conditions are enforced at the inﬂow, whereas a supersonic
ﬂow is assumed at the outﬂow, as indicated in ﬁgure 14a. An unstructured mesh of 468,854
triangular cells with a structured boundary layer region is constructed (Fig. 14b).
The problem is solved using the FCFV method and the ﬁrst-order density-based CCFV
solver by Ansys Fluent and the results are compared to a reference solution consisting of a
high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approximation of polynomial degree 3, computed
on a structured mesh of 16,000 triangular elements (Barter and Darmofal, 2007). Both
FV approaches are equipped with positivity-preserving Riemann solvers, namely an HLL
ﬂux for FCFV and an advection upstream splitting method (AUSM) ﬂux for CCFV. The
FCFV results (Fig. 15, left) show a good qualitative description of the ﬂowﬁeld for all
physical quantities, capturing both the strong bow shock and the steep temperature gra-
dient near the wall. It is worth noticing that the use of unstructured meshes such as the

tions, (b) mesh and (c-d) details of the unstructured and structured regions.

one in ﬁgure 14b is particularly challenging for high Mach number ﬂows because numerical
artifacts leading to asymmetries of the solution tend to appear, due to the curvature of the
streamlines along the stagnation line (Nompelis, Drayna and Candler, 2004; Gnoﬀo and
White, 2004; Ching et al., 2019). The FCFV method is able to preserve the symmetry of
the solution, conﬁrming its accuracy and robustness, even for M∞ = 4. For Ansys Fluent
CCFV solver, a relaxation approach based on an artiﬁcial time step, with CFL number
between 0.1 and 0.5, is employed to achieve a steady-state solution. The ﬁrst-order solver
with the relaxation approach, the positivity-preserving AUSM scheme and a ﬂux limiter
provides the steady-state solution on the right of ﬁgure 15, exhibiting a loss of accuracy
due to the carbuncle phenomenon. This is caused by a lack of dissipation of the numerical
discretisation, leading to numerical instabilities in the shock, with a nonphysical peak in
the normal region to the bow shock (Elling, 2009; Kitamura, Shima and Roe, 2012; Pan-
dolﬁ and D'Ambrosio, 2001; Chauvat, Moschetta and Gressier, 2005; Kitamura and Shima,
2013). A common approach to remedy this issue is to employ diﬀerent numerical ﬂuxes
in the simulation. Nonetheless, the alternative option provided by Ansys Fluent consists

27

of the Roe ﬂux, which is prone to develop the carbuncle phenomenon in the presence of
strong bow shocks. Indeed, diﬀerent combinations of CCFV solvers with the Roe ﬂux and
various time-stepping strategies, not reported here for brevity, were tested, all leading to
unstable results. Moreover, it is worth noticing that the second-order CCFV scheme was
unable to converge in this problem.

Ansys Fluent.

Finally, a quantitative assessment of the accuracy of the FCFV solution is performed
comparing the wall quantities with the reference results in (Barter and Darmofal, 2007).
Figures 16a and 16b showcase excellent agreement of the FCFV approximation of the pres-
sure and the skin friction coeﬃcient with the reference solution, with L2 errors of 0.7%
and 2.9%, respectively. Moreover, the Stanton number (or heat transfer coeﬃcient) is dis-
played in ﬁgure 16c: for this quantity, the FCFV method provides an overall similarity of
the proﬁle but a certain discrepancy is observed in the neighbourhood of the leading edge.
In particular, the asymmetry of the FCFV solution is probably inﬂuenced by the unstruc-
tured nature of the mesh in the region outside the boundary layer, see ﬁgure 14b, whereas
the reference solution is computed using a symmetric grid. Nonetheless, the relative L2
error of the overall approximation is 5.0%. On the contrary, the carbuncle phenomenon
in the results yielded by Ansys Fluent leads to completely erroneous predictions of all the
quantities of interest under analysis.

5 Concluding remarks

An extensive benchmark study of the FCFV method was presented for compressible laminar
ﬂows across a variety of regimes, from inviscid to viscous laminar ﬂows, from subsonic to
transonic and supersonic ﬂows. The assessment of the numerical properties of the method
was performed via a qualitative analysis of the distribution of the physical variables and
a quantitative analysis of aerodynamic quantities of interest, including drag, lift, pressure,
skin friction and heat transfer coeﬃcients. The FCFV results were compared to reference
values published in the literature, as well as to the solution provided by the CCFV solvers
available in the commercial CFD software Ansys Fluent.
More precisely, the compressible Taylor-Couette ﬂow was employed to assess the conver-
gence properties of the FCFV method using both regular and distorted meshes. The results
display that the method provides ﬁrst-order convergence of the stress tensor, the heat ﬂux,
the primitive variables (density, velocity, temperature and pressure) and the conservative
variables (momentum and energy), showing the insensitiveness of this approach to cell
distortion. On the contrary, the CCFV solver by Ansys Fluent outperforms the FCFV
method in the approximation of the velocity and the temperature using structured regular
meshes thanks to the reconstruction of the gradient. Nonetheless, such an advantage is
lost when distorted grids are employed and the accuracy of the CCFV scheme deteriorates,
especially in the approximation of the stress tensor and the heat ﬂux. This is particularly
critical in the evaluation of quantities of engineering interest, such as drag, lift and heat
transfer coeﬃcients, which involve the gradient of the ﬂow variables.
To further study the robustness and accuracy properties of the FCFV method, a set of
viscous and inviscid ﬂows over a NACA 0012 aerofoil was presented. On the one hand, the
viscous cases conﬁrmed the capability of the FCFV scheme to accurately predict quantities
of engineering interest, even in the presence of highly stretched meshes in the boundary
layer region. Indeed, the method provided results comparable to Ansys Fluent ﬁrst-order
CCFV solver, whereas the second-order one outperformed the remaining two approaches on

29

coarse meshes. On the other hand, the results of the inviscid tests highlighted a stronger
sensitivity of the FV methods under analysis to the value of the Mach number. More
precisely, although for subsonic ﬂows Ansys Fluent CCFV solvers outperformed the FCFV
method, the latter provided more accurate and robust results in supersonic ﬂows with
strong bow shocks.

The superiority of the FCFV method for high Mach number simulations was also observed
in the viscous case, with the laminar ﬂow over a cylinder at Mach 4.
In this context,
the FCFV method showed its superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness
by providing an accurate description of the ﬂowﬁeld and a prediction of the engineering
quantities of interest with errors below 5%, even when unstructured meshes were employed
outside the boundary layer. This problem is especially challenging because the combi-
nation of unstructured meshes and high Mach number is known to yield the appearance
of numerical artifacts due to the carbuncle phenomenon suﬀered by many discretisation
methods, including Ansys Fluent CCFV solvers.

Finally, the FCFV method was shown to be robust also in the incompressible limit, inde-
pendently of the type of computational mesh. Although classical CCFV schemes provide
excellent results using structured grids, the quality of the approximation greatly deterio-
rates when unstructured meshes are employed, leading to oscillatory solutions unable to
converge to a steady-state result. To remedy this issue the solver provided by Ansys Flu-
ent relies on pressure correction techniques to retrieve stable solutions. Nonetheless, the
resulting approximation displays an error of one order of magnitude with respect to Bla-
sius’ solution, whereas the FCFV method provides excellent agreement with the analytical
solution.

To summarise, the FCFV method demonstrates a robust performance in a wide variety of
ﬂow conditions, providing accurate solutions on general unstructured meshes, insensitively
of cell distortion and stretching. The presented results showcase the suitability of the
method to treat industrial ﬂow problems with complex geometries, relaxing the restrictions
of mesh quality imposed by existing FV solvers and alleviating the need for time-consuming
manual mesh generation procedures performed by specialised technicians. Future studies
will investigate tailored solution strategies for the FCFV simulation of large-scale systems
and turbulent phenomena.
