ABSTRACT
[Background:] Teamwork, coordination, and communication are a
prerequisite for the timely completion of a software project. Meet-
ings as a facilitator for coordination and communication are an
established medium for information exchange. Analyses of meet-
ings in software projects have shown that certain interactions in
these meetings, such as proactive statements followed by support-
ive ones, influence the mood and motivation of a team, which in
turn affects its productivity. So far, however, research has focused
only on certain interactions at a detailed level, requiring a complex
and fine-grained analysis of a meeting itself.
[Aim:] In this paper, we investigate meetings from a more abstract
perspective, focusing on the polarity of the statements, i.e., whether
they appear to be positive, negative, or neutral.
[Method:] We analyze the relationship between the polarity of state-
ments in meetings and different social aspects, including conflicts
as well as the mood before and after a meeting.
[Results:] Our results emerge from 21 student software project meet-
ings and show some interesting insights: (1) Positive mood before a
meeting is both related to the amount of positive statements in the
beginning, as well as throughout the whole meeting, (2) negative
mood before the meeting only influences the amount of negative
statements in the first quarter of the meeting, but not the whole
meeting, and (3) the amount of positive and negative statements
during the meeting has no influence on the mood afterwards.
[Conclusions:] We conclude that the behaviour in meetings might
rather influence short-term emotional states (feelings) than long-
term emotional states (mood), which are more important for the
project.

1 INTRODUCTION
Meetings are an established medium to share information in soft-
ware projects [2, 13, 31]. If they are well organized and if the partic-
ipants interact adequately, meetings are an efficient way to trans-
port a lot of information in a short amount of time [25]. However,
meetings are not always as effective as they might be, causing
demotivation and frustration [11, 17]. Besides the effectivity of a
meeting, other factors such as interactions and how the participants
communicate play a major role [3, 22, 28]. Focusing on software
development teams, Schneider et al. [31] showed that proactive
statements followed by supportive statements in a meeting increase
positive affect afterwards.

Schneider et al. [31] applied so-called interaction analysis in
meetings by focusing on interactions such as interrupting other
participants, blaming, and praising [11, 17, 27]. Interactions, includ-
ing statements, are assigned to a code according to their meaning,
e.g., whining, describing a problem, connecting problem and solu-
tion, and getting lost in details [11, 17]. Most interactions can be
advantageous or disadvantageous for meetings (depending on the
intention and the situation) [11]. For example, talking about prob-
lems is often perceived as not-negative, as only known problems
can be solved [12]. Given this fact, interaction analysis provides an
objective picture of the meeting, without allowing conclusions on
whether the team is satisfied with the meeting or not.

So far, the influence of meetings on social aspects, such as mood,
motivation, and productivity, has only been partially explored [15].
For example, it is unclear whether and how a meeting influences
the mood of a team afterwards. However, given the amount of time
most software project team members spend in meetings, knowing
about the influence of meetings on the project (including team-
related aspects such as motivation and productivity) is of particular
importance [17, 22, 28].

In this paper, we analyze the statements made in meetings ac-
cording to their polarity (i.e., whether they are positive, negative,
or neutral) regarding their relation to social aspects. We analyze
21 student software projects to investigate (1) whether there is an
influence of the mood of a team before the meeting on the polarity
of the statements made during the meeting, (2) whether the polarity
of the statements has an influence on the mood of a team after the

meeting, and (3) whether the polarity of the statements is related
to the perceived risk of social or task-related conflicts during the
project. In these projects, the first team meeting was recorded on
video and the participants reported on various social aspects.

Despite the small sample size, we make three noteworthy ob-
servations: (1) Students intuitively behave adequately in meetings,
having way more positive than negative statements during the
meetings, (2) starting a meeting with a high positive mood can
smooth both the meeting start as well as the meeting as a whole,
and (3) the polarity of statements made during the meeting has no
measurable influence on the mood afterwards.

Outline. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2,
we present background information and related work. Section 3
summarizes our research design with the research questions, the
data base, the data collection, and the data analysis procedures. In
Section 4, we present the results which we discuss in Section 5.
Section 6 concludes the paper and presents future work.

2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Meeting analysis has frequently been subject to software engineer-
ing research. Based on insights from 20 student software projects,
Schneider et al. [32] investigate relationships between media, mood,
and meetings. Liskin et al. [21] analyze meeting profiles of 14 stu-
dent development teams based on the duration and the frequency
in different project phases. Their results show a relation between
the meeting behavior and perceived pressure during the project.

In 1992, Olson et al. [24] investigated interactions in meetings
of development teams. They analyzed ten design meetings in four
projects by assigning each statement made during the meeting to a
category such as “issue”, “project management” or “meeting man-
agement”. Schneider et al. [31] analyzed the behavior of 155 student
software developers in 32 teams during their first team meeting.
They used an established coding scheme from psychology. Their
results show a significant positive influence of proactive statements
on a team’s affect. Developers tend to be more satisfied if proactive
behavior was present during the meeting. This effect increased if
proactive statements were followed by supportive statements. Pren-
ner et al. [27] analyzed the relation between meeting satisfaction
and the occurrence of single categories used by Schneider et al. [31].
Besides the meeting analysis on interaction level, some authors
analyzed the content of a meeting. Gall and Berenbach [5] present
a framework that automatically extracts information in elicitation
meetings. Shakeri et al. [1] also support elicitation meetings by auto-
matically extracting knowledge related to requirements. In contrast
to these two approaches, Karras et al. [9, 10] developed a manual
approach that combines textual minutes and video recordings to
analyze the content of elicitation meetings.

Herrmann and Klünder [7] propose to apply sentiment analysis
to statements in meetings. This approach provides an overview of
the polarity of the statements in a meeting, i.e., whether the ma-
jority of statements is positive, negative, or neutral. Their concept
processes live meeting audio data which is classified into sentiment
polarity classes. They tested their concept in a preliminary study
with a student software project team in comparison to the results
of a human observer, showing moderate agreement [7].

Sentiment analysis has frequently been applied to text-based
communication in software projects [23]. According to a recent
literature review [23], there are three main topics in software engi-
neering research on sentiment analysis: (1) Development of senti-
ment analysis tools, (2) comparison of different tools, and (3) appli-
cation of the tools in specific contexts. As in this paper sentiment
analysis is used as an analysis method, we are mainly interested
in existing tools that fit best for our matter. For the software engi-
neering domain, there are three tools: SentiStrength-SE, Senti4SD,
and SentiCR [23]. These tools are trained using different data bases,
leading to a different context of use. For example, SentiCR is de-
signed for code reviews. As our analysis is based on a German data
set, we need a German sentiment analysis tool. However, as far as
we know, there is only one software engineering specific attempt
to train a classifier based on German data [14]. Klünder et al. [14]
use communication data from Zulip, the communication tool used
in that software project. The authors label the data themselves and
use it as input to train the classifier. They reach an accuracy of
62.97%, which is mainly due to the small size of the data set.

The research presented in this paper uses sentiment analysis
to draw conclusions between social aspects and the polarity of
statements in meetings. That is, we use sentiment analysis as a
method without making it subject to our research. This way, we
investigate if the mood in a team is related to meeting behavior, and
if meeting behavior is related to the mood and conflicts afterwards.

3 RESEARCH DESIGN
In the following, we present the research design with the underlying
research questions, information about the used data set, and the
data analysis procedures.

3.1 Research Goal and Research Questions
The overall goal of the research presented in this paper is to investi-
gate relationships between the mood of a team and the statements
made in a meeting. In particular, we wanted to analyze relations be-
tween (1) the mood before a meeting, (2) the polarity of statements
in the meeting, and (3) the mood and other social aspects after a
meeting. For this purpose, we ask the following research questions:

RQ1: How are the mood of a team before a meeting, the polarity
of statements made during the meeting, and the team mood after a
meeting related to each other?

This question asks for a relationship between mood and meetings.
In particular, we analyze whether teams in a good or bad mood
make more positive or negative statements during the meetings,
and whether an increased number of positive or negative state-
ments in a meeting is related to a better or worse mood afterwards.

RQ2: How is the polarity of the statements made during a meeting
related to the likelihood of social or task-related conflicts in the team?

Besides the mood, there are several other aspects that influence
the collaboration in a team. This research question asks for a rela-
tion between the polarity of the statements made in a meeting and
whether conflicts are likely to be present throughout the project.

RQ3: How do the relationships between polarity and mood change
when only looking at meeting start and end?

To provide more detailed insights, we also want to analyze whether
the influences affect the meeting as a whole or just the first min-
utes (respectively that the last minutes mainly influence the mood
afterwards).

3.2 Data Set
Our analysis is based on two data sets used by Schneider et al. [31,
32]. The data sets emerged from student software projects con-
ducted at Leibniz University Hannover.

3.2.1 Data Source: Student Software Projects. The Software En-
gineering Group at Leibniz University Hannover offers a yearly
course for computer science students who are close to achieving
their bachelor degree. Usually, students in their third year (fifth se-
mester) of their bachelor studies participate in the course. In teams
consisting of three to five members, the students experience all
phases of a software project, including requirements elicitation, im-
plementation, testing, acceptance tests, and the delivery. Over the
project duration of 15 weeks, the students need to organize them-
selves, coordinate their communication and the communication
with the customer.

In these 15 weeks, the students develop a software for a customer
who is in most cases part of the Software Engineering Group. Exem-
plary projects are the development of a card game, the visualization
of communication, and a game with a labyrinth. Each student is
expected to invest about 270 hours in their project.

3.2.2 Data Collection. In the winter semesters starting in 2012 and
2013, the organizers of the course collected different kind of data
to be used to understand social aspects in (student) development
teams [31, 32]. As, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the
largest data sets consisting of different social aspects (including
reportings on conflicts, affect, communication) with recordings of
meetings, we decided to use this data set for our study.

In these two years, in total 165 students participated in the soft-
ware project, organized in 34 arbitrarily formed teams. The first
team meeting right after the first meeting with the customer was
video-recorded and transcribed [31]. In addition, throughout the
project, the teams were asked to report on various psychological
aspects, their meeting and communication behavior [32]. The psy-
chological aspects included positive and negative affect, satisfaction,
task-related and social conflicts. This data was collected using a
paper-pencil-questionnaire. While positive and negative affect were
rated before and after the meeting, all other variables were only col-
lected after the meeting (and weekly thereafter). For data collection,
established scales from psychology were used, e.g., the positive and
negative affect schedule (PANAS) [35] in its German version [19].
The data is organized in two data sets: The first data set contains
all of the psychological information collected over the full project
duration. The second data set contains meeting transcripts from 32
teams, although there were problems with the recordings in two
cases. The meetings were manually transcribed by PhD students
from psychology and software engineering.

3.2.3 Ethics Vote. The ethics committee at Leibniz Universität Han-
nover authorized this collection of data. The students were informed
about the data collection and the further usage. In particular, the
students got the guarantee that the data will not be published at
any time (neither the recordings or the transcripts, nor the other
data). Thus, we are not allowed to make the data publicly available.
Nevertheless, all data records were anonymized and the data did
not influence the success of passing the course.

3.2.4 Variable Selection. For the analyses presented in this paper,
we did not use the full data set. Instead, we concentrated on the
following data related to our research questions:

• Meeting transcripts containing textual representations of the
statements made during the meeting. The meetings were
manually transcribed by psychology and software engineer-
ing researchers involved in the project [31].

• Positive and negative affect before and after the meeting col-
lected using the established PANAS scale [35] in its German
version [19]. For both positive and negative affect, ten items
that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (from never to al-
ways) by each team member. Table 1 summarizes the items
for positive and negative affect. We describe the aggregation
of these items to team mood in Table 4.

• Social and task-related conflicts after the meeting collected
using Jehn’s intragroup conflict scale [8] in its German ver-
sion [20]. For both types of conflict, four items that are rated
on a 6-point Likert scale (from never / none to very often /
very much). The four items for each of the scales are summa-
rized in Table 2. We describe the aggregation of these items
to team mood in Table 4.

3.2.5 Data Selection and Cleaning. As part of the data cleaning
process, we removed transcripts that were obviously incomplete
in whole or in part, e.g., only ten statements made in a one-hour
meeting. These incomplete transcripts emerged from a low audio
quality. We removed data from eleven teams, leading to a total of
21 teams included in our study.

As part of the quality assurance, we went through the remaining
21 transcripts and removed all entries that represent “not applicable”
values (marked by “unv.”, which means “incomprehensible”). Note
that removing single entries did not lead to an exclusion of the

whole team from further analysis, as we assume that the polarity of
a single statement in a meeting does not impact the entire meeting.
In the end, we considered the data of 21 teams with a total of
102 participants as suitable for our analysis. Most of the teams (19)
consisted of 5 persons, with one team having 3 and another one
having four team members. The students had an average age of 23
years, and most of them (94 out of 102) reported being male. The
meetings had an average duration of 39 minutes and 49 seconds
(min: 7 minutes and 52 seconds, max: 74 minutes and 5 seconds, SD:
18 minutes and 3 seconds), and on average, 742 statements were
made in the meeting (min: 162, max: 1858, SD: 3975).

3.3 Data Analysis
We followed a three-step data analysis approach consisting of senti-
ment analysis on the meeting transcripts, a quantitative analysis on
team level and a descriptive analysis on person level. In particular,
we have eight main hypotheses (see Table 3) which we explain in
detail below with their relationships to variables used. Figure 1 pro-
vides an overview of these relationships for better understanding.
In Table 4, we also describe all variables which we calculated in the
respective way to investigate the hypotheses in our analysis.

Sentiment Analysis on Meetings. We applied sentiment anal-
3.3.1
ysis on the meeting transcripts to get an overview of the polarity of
the statements made during the meetings. As far as we know, there
is only one software engineering sentiment analysis tool for the Ger-
man language: the SEnti-Analyzer by Herrmann and Klünder [7],
originating from a tool introduced by Klünder et al. [14].

The SEnti-Analyzer is meant to apply sentiment analysis to soft-
ware project meetings. The tool processes meeting audio data and
automatically transcribes audio files [7]. Afterwards, a lexicon-
based algorithm classifies the statements according to their polarity.
For the classification, the sentiment analysis tool by Klünder et
al. [14] is applied to the transcript. This classifier is based on text
messages from an industrial software project and, hence, are related
to software engineering. We adjusted the tool to be applicable in our
context. For example, we removed the audio processing. This way,
we could use the transcripts as input for the sentiment analysis.

In the end of this analysis step, we retrieved three percentage
values per meeting: the amount of (1) positive, (2) negative, and

(3) neutral statements in the meeting. As we assume that neutral
statements do not lead to a shift in the mood of a team, we only
consider the amount of positive and negative statements of the
meeting, denoted as 𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠 and 𝑚𝑛𝑒𝑔, for further analysis.

To compare the use of positive and negative statements during
the meeting, we test the hypothesis H1 presented in Table 3 at a
significance level of 𝑝 = 0.05. First, we test the data for normal
distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test [33]. In case of normal
distribution, we use the repeated-measures t-test [34]. Otherwise,
we use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test [36].

3.3.2 Quantitative Analysis of the Whole Meeting. In the second
step, we analyzed the relation of different aspects on team level
using hypothesis testing. For this step, we used the variables 𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠 ,
𝑚𝑛𝑒𝑔, 𝑃𝐴(𝑇 , 𝑡1), 𝑃𝐴(𝑇 , 𝑡2), 𝑁 𝐴(𝑇 , 𝑡1), 𝑁 𝐴(𝑇 , 𝑡2), 𝑆𝐶 (𝑇 ) and 𝑇𝐶 (𝑇 )
(cf. Table 4), where 𝑡1 is before and 𝑡2 is after the meeting. Ac-
cording to Table 4, most these variables are ordinal-scaled, as we
calculated the median of a Likert scale. Only the amount of positive
and negative statements during the meeting, 𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠 and 𝑚𝑛𝑒𝑔, are
interval-scaled, each representing a percentage value ranging from
0% to 100%. These scales influence the choice of statistical tests.

In order to analyze the relation between the given variables, we
tested the hypotheses H2 to H4 presented in Table 3 using Spear-
man’s 𝜌. We analyzed the hypotheses at a significance level of
𝑝 ≤ 0.05. However, as we tested four hypotheses for each of the hy-
potheses H2, H3, and H4, we applied the Bonferroni correction [6]
leading to an adjusted significance level of 𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 = 𝑝/4 = 0.05/4 =
0.0125.

3.3.3 Quantitative Analysis of Meeting Start and End. Based on two
assumptions, we wanted to look into details of the start and the
end of the meeting:

Assumption 1: The mood of a team before a meeting influences
the first minutes rather than the whole meeting.

Assumption 2: The mood of a team after a meeting is influenced
by the last minutes rather than by the whole meeting.

These two assumptions lead to further hypotheses. First, we ana-
lyzed differences between the use of positive and negative state-
ments in the beginning and in the end of a meeting, leading to the
hypotheses H5 and H6 presented in Table 3. We decided to use the
first and the last quarter of statements. This selection may impact
the results (using the first and the last third would lead to other
results). We discuss the consequences following from this selection
in Section 5.4. As described in Section 3.3, we checked the data
for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test [33]. In case of
normal distribution, we used the repeated-measures t-test [34] to
test the hypothesis. Otherwise, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test [36]. Second, we tested the hypotheses H7 and H8 presented
in Table 3. These two hypotheses ask for a relationship between
the mood and the polarity of statements by just considering the
first and the last quarter of a meeting. Again, we tested the hy-
potheses using Spearman’s 𝜌 at a corrected significance level of
𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 = 0.0125.

3.4 Validity Procedures
We implemented some validity procedures to reduce and mitigate
some threats to validity.

While the first author performed all the statistical analysis and
the hypotheses testing, each step was carefully reviewed by the sec-
ond author of the paper. We further applied rigorous data cleaning
and selection procedures, being rather pessimistic than optimistic,
in order to avoid using incomplete data. The data cleaning and selec-
tion process was done manually by one author and again reviewed
by the other one.

When aggregating the results, we used the median instead of the
mean, as the data emerged from a Likert scale. Calculating the mean

would have led to more detailed results, which might have been
interesting for this analysis. However, from a mathematical view-
point, we went for the median in order to avoid over-interpreting
our results as the median is more robust against outliers. Besides,
the mean is not defined on ordinal scales that are not interval scaled.
We also used a significance level of 𝑝 = 0.05, which is a com-
mon procedure in software engineering research. As we tested four
hypotheses pointing to one main hypothesis, we applied the Bon-
ferroni correction, leading to an adjusted 𝑝-value of 𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 = 0.0125.

These implemented validity procedures mitigated some threats
to validity. However, there are still some threats we could not influ-
ence. These threats to validity will be discussed in Section 5.4.

4 RESULTS
We performed all steps of the data analysis as described in Sec-
tion 3.3. In the following, we describe the results.

4.1 Sentiment Analysis on Meetings
The students made on average 742 statements during the meetings
(min: 162, max: 1858, SD: 394). The amount of positive and negative
statements for the meetings is visualized in Figure 2. On average,
20.37% of the statements were positive, with a minimum of 10.79%
and a maximum of 33.58%. Compared to the positive statements,
very few statements were negative: The average amount of negative
statements is 0.87%, with a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 1.99%.
The Shapiro-Wilk test showed that the amount of positive and
negative statements are both normally distributed (positive: 𝑊 =

0.95536, 𝑝 = 0.42808; negative: 𝑊 = 0.93946, 𝑝 = 0.2127). Therefore,
we used the repeated-measures t-test to test hypothesis H1 (see
Table 3). The t-test showed a significant result (𝑡 = −14.68, 𝑝 <
0.00001). Therefore, we can reject H10 and conclude that there
is a significant difference in the amount of positive and negative
statements in the meeting. Comparing the mean values of positive
and negative statements, we see that positive statements are used
significantly more than negative statements.

Finding 1: Intuitively, most student software project teams
communicated positively or neutrally, with a maximum amount
of 2% of negative statements in the meeting.
Finding 2: The amount of positive statements is significantly
higher than the amount of negative statements.

Insights from Student Software Projects

ESEM ’22, September 19–23, 2022, Helsinki, Finland

Finding 3: We find no evidence for an influence of the mood
before the meeting and the polarity of statements during the
meeting.
Finding 4: However, the amount of positive statements de-
pends on the positive mood before the meeting, showing a
positive tendency: The higher the positive affect, the more pos-
itive statements.

Regarding the influence of the polarity of statements during the
meeting and the mood afterwards, we again find no evidence. As
none of the statistical tests concerning H3, namely the tests for
H3.1 to H3.4, were significant (neither at the “normal” nor at the
adjusted 𝑝-value), we can neither reject H3 nor one of the other
hypotheses H3.1 to H3.4.

Finding 5: We find no evidence for an influence of the polarity
of statements during the meeting on the mood of a team after
the meeting.

For H4, i.e. the relation between the probability for conflicts and the
polarity of the statements, we again find no significant test with a
𝑝-value that is smaller than 𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 . Therefore, we cannot reject H40.
However, three of the four hypotheses H4.1 to H4.4 are considered
significant at a significance level of 𝑝 = 0.05: We can reject H4.20,
H4.30, and H4.40, leading to the following findings:

Finding 6: The perceived likelihood for social conflicts depends
on the amount of negative statements during the meeting.
Finding 7: The perceived likelihood for task-related conflicts
depends on the amount of positive statements during the meet-
ing.
Finding 8: The perceived likelihood for task-related conflicts
depends on the amount of negative statements during the meet-
ing.

As all calculated 𝑟 -values for H4.2 to H4.4 are negative, we have
a negative influence. That is, the perceived likelihood for task-
related conflicts decreases with an increasing amount of positive or
negative statements, and the likelihood for social conflicts increases
with a decreasing amount of negative statements, and vice versa.

4.3 Quantitative Analysis of
Meeting Start&End

In order to test the hypotheses H5 and H6 (see Table 3) on the
differences between meeting start and end, we first analyzed the
data with respect to normal distribution. The Shapiro-Wilk test
showed that two variables for the positive statements are normally
distributed (𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠25 : 𝑊 = 0.9353, 𝑝 = 0.1758; 𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠75 = 0.9557, 𝑝 =
0.4335), whereas the other two are not (𝑚𝑛𝑒𝑔25 : 𝑊 = 0.80635; 𝑝 =
0.0008; 𝑚𝑛𝑒𝑔75 : 𝑊 = 0.8554, 𝑝 = 0.0053). Therefore, we tested
H5 using the repeated-measures t-test, and we used the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test for H6.

The t-test for H5 was significant (𝑡 = −2.819, 𝑝 = 0.0106). There-
fore, we reject H50 and assume that there is a difference in the

Figure 2: Positive and negative statements per meeting

4.2 Quantitative Analysis on Team Level
We calculated Spearman’s 𝜌 to investigate the hypotheses H2, H3,
and H4 using the variables described in Table 3. The results of the
tests are summarized in Table 5.

We find no evidence for an influence of the the mood before
the meeting on the polarity of statements during the meeting. Hy-
pothesis H2 cannot be rejected, as the only 𝑝-value that would be
considered significant (H2.1 with a 𝑝-value of 0.0331) is still above
the adjusted 𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 -value of 0.0125. Therefore, H2.1 can be rejected
(indicating a relation between the amount of positive statements
and the positive mood of team before the meeting), but we cannot
generalize this insight to make a statement about H2.

amount of positive statements comparing the start and the end of
a meeting. The mean amount of positive statements in the first
quarter of the meeting is 22.43% (min: 14.56%, max: 36.76%), and
the mean in the last quarter of the meeting is 19.44% (min: 9.6%,
max: 33.58%). These values raise the impression that the amount
of positive statements in the beginning is significantly higher than
in the end, but given the small difference in the mean value, this
finding should be handled with care.

Finding 9: There is a significant difference between the amount
of positive statements comparing the first and the last quarter
of the meeting.
Finding 10: On average, in the first quarter, 22.43% of the
statements are positive, which is slightly more than the average
for the last quarter of 19.44%.

To compare the amount of negative statements in the first and the
last quarter of the meeting, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test. The test did not result in a significant result (𝑧 = −0.9087, 𝑝 =
0.3628). Thus, we cannot reject H60.

Finding 11: We find no difference between the amount of neg-
ative statements when comparing the first and the last quarter
of the meeting.

In a next step, we tested the hypotheses H7 and H8 presented in
Table 3. The results of Spearman’s 𝜌 are summarized in Table 6.

We find significant results for H7.1 and H7.4. Therefore, we can
reject H7.10 and H7.40 and conclude that there is an influence of
the positive mood of a team before the meeting and the amount of
positive statements in the first quarter (and respectively for negative
statements). However, as both 𝑝-values are above the adjusted 𝑝-
value of 0.0125, we cannot reject H7.

Finding 12: The positive mood of a team before the meeting
influences the amount of positive statements in the first quarter
of the meeting.
Finding 13: The same is correct for negative statements: The
negative mood of a team influences the amount of negative
statements in the first quarter.

Regarding H8, we find no significant results. Thus, we can neither
reject H8, nor one of the hypotheses H8.1 to H8.4.

Finding 14: We find no evidence for an influence of the state-
ments made in the last quarter of the meeting and the mood
afterwards.

5 DISCUSSION
Based on our results, we conclude this paper by answering the re-
search questions, discussing our results, and presenting the threats
to validity.

5.1 Answering the Research Questions
According to the results emerging from 21 student software projects,
we can answer the three research questions posed in Section 3.1 as
follows:

Answer to RQ1: Surprisingly, we only find evidence for a very few
relations between the three parameters (1) mood before the meeting,
(2) polarity of statements during the meeting, and (3) mood after
the meeting. According to our results, positive mood before the
meeting and the amount of positive statements during the meeting
are related to each other (and given the timeframe, positive mood
influences the amount of positive statements). We do not find any
additional significant influences between these three parameters.

Answer to RQ2: Regarding the polarity of statements made during
the meeting and the likelihood of conflicts afterwards, our results
show a relation between these parameters. There is a significant
influence of both positive and negative statements on task-related
conflicts, as well as an influence of positive statements on social
conflicts. All these relations are negative, that is the more posi-
tive/negative statements, the less conflicts and vice versa.

Answer to RQ3: Only considering the first and the last quarter
of the meeting, we find an influence of the positive mood of a
team before the meeting on the amount of positive statements,
and an influence of the negative mood of a team on the amount of
negative statements. Both influences are positive: The higher the
positive/negative affect, the higher the amount of positive/negative
statements. However, we do not find evidence for an influence of
the polarity of the statements on the mood after the meeting.

5.2 Interpretation
Our results allow three noteworthy observations:

• Students intuitively behave adequately in meetings, mak-
ing way more positive than negative statements during the
meetings.

• Starting a meeting with a high positive mood can smooth
both the meeting start as well as the meeting as a whole.
• The polarity of statements made during the meeting has no

measurable influence on the mood afterwards.

While the two first observations are self-explanatory and intu-
itive, the last one is not that obvious. According to the results of our
study, a positive mood has an influence on the amount of positive

Meetings and Mood – Related or Not? Insights from Student Software Projects

ESEM ’22, September 19–23, 2022, Helsinki, Finland

statements both at meeting start and throughout the meeting. How-
ever, as mood is a long-term affective state, it is difficult to change
it right before a meeting. In future research, it would be interesting
to conduct the same study focusing on short-term emotional states,
i.e., emotions instead of affect, as they can be “changed” more easily
(e.g., by bringing sweets to the meeting).

Another example for interesting findings with a significant in-
fluence are Findings 7 and 8: Both findings show an influence of
positive respectively negative statements on the perceived likeli-
hood of task-related conflicts. Looking at the results of the statistical
tests, we observe an influence in the same direction (both 𝑟 -values
are below 0). Therefore, we have an influence of both negative
and positive statements on task-related conflicts showing the de-
sired tendency. That is, the more positive (or negative) statements,
the lower the perceived likelihood for task-related conflicts. Con-
sequently, one can conclude that it does not matter whether the
statements are positive or negative, but they should not be neutral
to lower the risk for task-related conflicts. One possible explanation
is that both positive and negative statements can be used to point to
a task-related conflict (e.g., given by unclear tasks or misunderstood
requirements). It is less important how the meeting participants
point to these issues, as long as they are mentioned at all.

Besides the significant results we found in our data, it is inter-
esting which results we did not see: Why is there no influence
of the meeting on the mood afterwards? None of the hypotheses
H3.x and H8.x are significant. There are two possible explanations:
First, it is possible that there is an influence that we simply do not
see in our data. This can be due to a too small 𝑛, the nature of
student projects, or the study itself. But, there is another possible
explanation emerging when we look at the definition of mood and
emotion. Psychologists distinguish between two definitions: emo-
tion and mood. While an emotion is a short-term and rather intense
experience [30], mood differs from this in duration and intensity.
According to Ekkekakis and Russel [4], mood is an affective state
more persistent than an emotional state, and hence more stable.
This difference between short-term emotional state and long-term
affective state might explain the results of our analysis.

In our analysis, we used PANAS (positive and negative affect
schedule) that is a measure for long-term affective states. Looking
at the definition of mood, it is a long-term affective state [29]. There-
fore, it is possible (and not unlikely) that the short-term emotional
state (emotions) after a meeting changes, if there were too many
negative statements in the meeting, but this does not necessarily
lead to an increase in the negative long-term affective state (mood).
Consequently, it is likely that “bad behavior” in meetings (in terms
of negative statements) can affect the short-term emotional state
after the meeting, but has no (or only marginal) influence on the
long-term affective state. The meeting itself is just a short point in
time compared to the longer time frame that has an influence on
the long-term affective state (PANAS often asks for a rating over a
period of one week [32]). Therefore, the meeting may change the
emotions of the participants afterwards, but has not a measurable
influence on the mood.

Therefore, looking at future meetings, despite the fact that we
do not observe an influence of the statements in the meeting on the
mood afterwards, one must not assume that there is no influence.
We considered the influence on the long-term affective state, but

it is not unlikely that short-term emotional states are influenced
by the behavior in meetings. However, it is worth a thought to pay
more attention to effective meetings than to an adequate behavior
(which should be natural).

Considering other non-significant results, it is kind of sooth-
ing that negative mood before the meeting has no influence on
the polarity of the statements made during the meeting. There are
again two possible explanations: First, it is possible that the vari-
ance in the negative mood is rather small, so that all participants
were in a rather “good mood” (i.e. having a higher positive than
negative affective state). Second, it is possible that the student meet-
ing participants were sufficiently professional that their negative
affective state did not influence the whole meeting. As we find a
significant relation between the negative mood before a meeting
and the amount of negative statements in the first quarter of the
meeting, it might be that the students are not able to completely
compensate a “bad mood”, but are able to refocus after a couple of
minutes, forgetting the reasons for their negative affective state.

5.3 Future Work
According to our results, there is no relation between the meeting
and the mood. However, as discussed before, it is likely that the
short-term emotional states are affected by the polarity of the state-
ments in the meetings, and, thus, by the meeting itself. Therefore,
future studies focusing on this short-term effect are necessary to
analyze this assumption in more detail. For example, a similar study
using the wheel of emotion [26] to measure the short-term emo-
tional state would be interesting and helps investigate the relation
between meetings and mood in more detail.

In addition, a more diverse sentiment analysis not only focusing
on polarities would also be interesting to draw conclusions on the
long-term affective state after a meeting. That is, increasing the
granularity of the polarities of the statements (considering joyful,
friendly, angry, or other types of statements instead of positive,
negative, or neutral) would lead to more fine-grained results and
can uncover insights that are impossible with the analysis presented
in this paper.

Besides, given the increasing amount of online meetings, it would
also be interesting to conduct a similar study in remote or hybrid
settings, assuming that interaction patterns differ between different
types of meetings. In line with this thought, it would also be helpful
to replicate such studies with different teams in different contexts
(experience, duration of collaboration, and similar).

Based on these more detailed analyses, it would be possible to
provide concrete recommendations for future meetings to increase
the chance for a satisfied software project team. These recommenda-
tions may include information on wether it is meaningful to assess
a team’s mood before a meeting (and how to do so), and what to do
in case of negative mood before a meeting (or in case of too good
mood, e.g., due to holidays starting soon).

However, afterwards, the usefulness for industry needs to be
evaluated in real-world settings. That is: Do practitioners need
support to identify negative statements in order to avoid negative
effects (that, indeed, do not seem to be related to the statements)?
Or are they aware of the relevance of their meeting behaviour?
Consequently, an interview study in industry on the difficulties in

ESEM ’22, September 19–23, 2022, Helsinki, Finland

software projects caused by or related to social aspects can point
to future research directions.

future research should take into account different phases of team
building.

In addition, there are several other open questions regarding
meetings and social aspects in software projects: How are decisions
during a meeting influenced by the overall team mood? That is,
does a team decide differently in dependence of the mood? More
concretely, it would be interesting to analyze if a negative mood
lead to lower quality decisions.

To the best of our knowledge, there is, so far, no study inves-
tigating pain points in industry that are related to social aspects.
Research has often proven relationships between social aspects and
project-related aspects (cf. [16, 18]), but it remains unclear what
research needs to provide in order to be applicable and useful for
industry.

5.4 Threats to Validity
Despite the implemented validity procedures described in Sec-
tion 3.4, the results of our study are subject to some limitations and
threats to validity. In this section, we discuss the threats according
to the classification by Wohlin et al. [37].

Construct Validity. The results of our study are based on a data
collection by Schneider et al. [31, 32]. The data was collected using
paper-pencil-questionnaires and established scales from psychol-
ogy. Given the language used in psychology, it is possible that some
students did not know how to report, e.g., on their long-term af-
fective state compared to their short-term emotional state. Such
misunderstandings, misinterpretations, or misconceptions would
have influenced the data collected. However, to reduce the influence
of single misunderstandings, we aggregated all data on team level.
That is, we first calculated the median on personal level (such that
one item had an influence of only 10% on the median), and then we
aggregated the median values again to retrieve the mood. These
aggregations reduced the influence of single misunderstood ratings.

Internal Validity. Survey results reflect personal perspectives and
subjective opinions. In particular, the used questionnaires asked for
psychological aspects such as mood and conflicts. Answering or
rating these items is very subjective and depends on the participants.
Consequently, the results cannot be considered objective.

Before starting the analysis, we carefully cleaned the data and
defined the data set to be used for the analysis. That is, we removed
incomplete data points as described in Section 3.2.5. The data anal-
ysis followed a stringent procedure performed by one researcher
and reviewed by another one.

Nevertheless, despite the data cleaning procedures, the threat of
the age of the data cannot be mitigated. Our analysis is based on
data that was collected almost a decade ago. Although there still are
face-to-face meetings, a not negligible amount of meetings takes
place in an online setting. We assume that some of our results are
also correct for remote settings, but further research is required to
allow drawing similar conclusions for today’s meetings.

In addition, only 2% of the statements in the meeting were neg-
ative. Given that team members did not know each other a long
time before the meeting, it is possible that the amount of negative
statements is higher in teams that already worked together for
a long time and, thus, know each other very well. Consequently,

Conclusion Validity. In this paper, we performed statistical anal-
ysis and hypotheses testing. Despite the small sample size of 21
teams, we retrieved significant results. We applied the Bonferroni
correction if necessary, and also calculated the 𝑝-value when ap-
plying Spearman’s 𝜌. This way, we did not only get a correlation
coefficient, but also its reliability.

Nevertheless, our results are only based on a sample size of 21
student software projects. Further research is required to provide
deeper insights and to increase the reliability of our results.

External Validity. As the data set emerged from a course at Leib-
niz University Hannover, we had no influence on the participant
selection. All of them were computer science students close to their
bachelor’s degree. Using students as participants always reduces
the generalizability of the results, as student projects are not neces-
sarily comparable to real industrial projects. However, a first step
to analyze the relation between mood and meeting on a basic level
requires comparable data sets to draw conclusions. Therefore, de-
spite the impossibility to generalize the results to industry, we used
this respective data set.

6 CONCLUSION
Using data from 21 student software projects, we analyzed the rela-
tion between mood before a meeting, the polarity of the statements
during the meeting, the mood after a meeting, and the perceived
likelihood for social and task-related conflicts. To provide more
fine-grained results, we also divided the meeting into three parts:
first quarter, middle, and last quarter, and analyzed the influence
between beginning and end, and the respective mood.

Our results show that positive and negative mood before a meet-
ing are related to the amount of positive respectively negative
statements in the beginning of the meeting. However, neither the
meeting as a whole nor the last quarter of a meeting are related
to the mood afterwards. Nevertheless, the perceived likelihood for
social and task-related conflicts depends on the amount of positive
and negative statements during the meeting.

Future research can strengthen the results by using real (indus-
trial) software projects instead of student projects, and by changing
the measured aspects. For example, looking at short-term emotional
states (emotions) instead of long-term affective states (mood or af-
fect) might provide deeper insights and can help further improve
future meetings.
