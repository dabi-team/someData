COMSOL Multiphysics software is used to describe the behavior of the electrical resistivity of several samples 
with  rectangular  shape  typically  used  in  the  Montgomery  method.  The  simulation  data  obtained  using  four 
isotropic conductors allowed us to understand in detail the behavior of the electric potential and electric field 
of the samples. The results provide an analytical method which can substitute the four-probe method with much 
more simplicity and precision.

I. INTRODUCTION 

The electrical resistivity (ρ) of a given material is one of 
the  most  important  physical  properties  and  its  correct 
determination  has  been  the  object  of  intense  study  during 
the last century.1-5 This property has been used to classify 
materials  into  metals,  semiconductors,  insulators,  and 
superconductors, which are the basis for electronic devices, 
such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and many 
others.6, 7 

Several methods have been described for measuring the 
electrical resistivity.8-19 One of them was first described in 
1915  by  Frank  Wenner,8  who  was  trying  to  measure  the 
electrical resistivity of the Earth with a method based on in-
line four-probes. Basically, the voltage drop V is measured 
between  the  two  internal  contacts,  while  an  electrical 
current  I  is  injected  through  the  two  external  terminals. 
Later  on,  this  method  was  used  to  measure  the  electrical 
resistivity of a semiconductor wafer, being established as a 
reference  procedure  of  the  American  Society  for  Testing 
and for Materials Standards.20 Nowadays, this method has 
been  widely  used  to  measure  the  electrical  resistivity  of 
conducting  materials  and 
the 
it 
conventional four probe method (4P method).1 

is  well  known  as 

In  fact,  4P  method  is  based  upon  the  Ohm’s  law.1  the 
four electrodes are usually arranged along to one of the faces 
of a rectangular sample, as shown in Figure 1, which must 
strictly respect some geometrical aspects. 

FIG. 1. Schematic view of the electrical contacts in the 4P method for a 
sample  with  rectangular  shape,  in  which:  i)  the  sample  geometry  must 
respect √𝐴 ≪ 𝑙; ii) the voltage contacts should be aligned perpendicular to 
the distance l; and iii) the electrical current terminals must be large enough 
to have small contact resistances to avoid Joule self-heating. 

Applying an electric field (𝐸) to a conductor, an electric 
current (𝐼) immediately appears and the electrical resistivity 
can be calculated from the ratio of the electric field and the 
current  density  (𝐽 ≡ 𝐼/𝐴).21  In  fact,     is  not  directly 
determined 
the  experiments,  but  calculated  after 
measuring  the  electrical  resistance  (𝑅),  which  is  obtained 
from the ratio of the measured voltage drop and the applied 
current.  

in 

The electrical resistivity is calculated by 

  = 𝑅

𝐴
𝑙

                                         (1) 

where  𝐴 = 𝑤𝑑  is  the area  of  the  specimen  and  𝑙  is 
the distance between the two points where the voltage drop 
is measured. 

In order to have precise determination of the electrical 
resistivity,  the  geometry  of  the  sample  and  the  electrical 
contacts must be well established. To measure the voltage 
drop,  the  electric  field  must  be  approximately  constant, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and thickness 𝐿3 = 1 m, which respects 𝐿3 < √𝐿1𝐿2. Thus, 
the boundary conditions were determined in the following 
way: 

𝑉𝐴 = 𝑉(−𝐿1/2, 𝐿2) = −100 V                   (4a) 

𝑉𝐵 = 𝑉(𝐿1/2, 𝐿2) = 100 V                     (4b) 

and for any other point in the boundary, the simulations took 

𝑛 ∙ 𝐽 = 0 ,                                 (4c)  

where 𝑛 is normal vector at the surface boundary. 

In the COMSOL software the distributions of electric 
field  lines  as  well  as  equipotential  lines  were  easily 
simulated and the values of the 𝑉, 𝐸, 𝐼, and 𝐽 as a function 
of the positions were recorded. Some schematic 2D view of 
the equipotential and electric field lines were also obtained. 
For  example,  Figure  2  displays  these  lines  for  a  typical 
isotropic conductor with rectangular thin geometry 

which is obtained cutting the sample with aspect ratio that 
respects  √𝐴 ≪ 𝑙.  The  voltage  contacts  should  be  point  or 
line-like (see Figure 1 again), which must be perpendicular 
to the electrical field lines. Furthermore, both voltage and 
electrical  current  terminals  must  have  very  small  contact 
resistance  to  avoid  thermopower  and  Joule  self-heating 
effects. 

Although  widely  used,  the  4P  method  has  some 
limitations  due  these  experimental  requirements.  Samples 
of interest to be measured are usually in the millimeter size 
range  and  many  times  are  not  bars.  In  addition,  electrical 
contacts  cannot  be  prepared  as  pointed  out  above.  These 
typical  limitations  always  provide  electrical  resistivity 
measurements which have errors as large as 10 to 50%.12, 13 
In  this  work  the  problem  of  measuring  the  electrical 
resistivity  of  isotropic  samples  of  finite  dimensions  using 
the four-probe techniques has been revisited. Our previous 
experience measuring transport properties of isotropic and 
anisotropic  samples  lead  us  to  modified  the  Montgomery 
and the van der Pauw methods.17, 18 Those works allowed to 
find  ways  to  calculate  the  electrical  resistivity  of  both 
isotropic and anisotropic samples analytically. However, in 
order  to  understand  these  methods  deeper,  we  intend  to 
apply  them  to  several  sample  geometries  of  different 
conducting  materials.  This  is  not  a  simple  experimental 
task.  We  have  noticed  that  this  could  be  done  by  using 
numerical  simulations.  This  work  reports  our  first 
simulation  results  obtained  from  COMSOL  Multiphysics 
software 
the 
Montgomery  method.  The  simulations  provide  a  method 
which is simpler and more precise than the 4P method.

II. METHODOLOGY 

COMSOL Multiphysics software was used to carry out 
all the simulations shown in this work.22 This commercial 
software  is  much  used  for  numerical  projects  in  several 
knowledge areas, such as electric field, heat and mass flow, 
fatigue, and environmental studies, among others.23-28 

We  have  solved the problem  of two dimensional (2D) 
stationary  electrical  currents 
in  conductive  media, 
considering  the  equation  of  continuity  in  a  stationary 
coordinate  system,  based  on  the  Ohm’s  law,  which  states 
that  

𝐽 = 𝜎𝐸 + 𝐽𝑒 ,           

(2) 

where  𝜎  is  the  electrical  conductivity  (in  S/m),  E  is  the 
electric  field  (in  V/m),  and  𝐽𝑒  is  an  externally  generated 
current  density  (in  A/m2),  which  is  taken  zero  in  the 
simulations. In such a case, the static form of the equation 
of continuity is given by 

∇ ∙ 𝐽 = −∇ ∙ (𝜎∇𝑉) = 0 .                        (3)

electric  field  lines  for  a  rectangular  isotropic  thin  sample  of  dimensions 
𝐿1 and 𝐿2 obtained using COMSOL multiphysics software. Input electric 
potentials are applied at A and B poles and output voltage is measured at 
C and D corners. The scale with color represents the voltage change over 
the entire simulated area. The highlighted vertical red line represents the 
zero equipotential line (at x = 0) and divided the rectangular sample into 
two  symmetric  parts.  The  other  two  red  lines  touching  the  points  C =
(𝐿1/2 , 0) and D = (−𝐿1/2 , 0) are equipotential lines which provide 𝑉1 =
𝑉C − 𝑉D, which is crucial for the Montgomery method. (Lower) It is shown 
the typical sample geometry used in the Montgomery method. 

 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         
 
 
To  verify  the  distribution  of  the  equipotential  and 
electric field lines across the samples, the electric potentials 
of −100 V and +100 V (Equations 4a and b) were used in 
the A and B poles, as shown in Figure 2. They simulated the 
application of the electrical current in the both poles as done 
in  the  Montgomery  experiments  (see  the  lower  Figure  2), 
whose  value 
(𝑉 = 𝑉B − 𝑉A = 200 V) and the electrical resistance of the 
samples, which depends on the conducting material and the 
geometrical parameters 𝐿1, 𝐿2, and 𝐿3.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Figure 3 displays the electric potential (𝑉) and electric 
field  (𝐸)  for  four  rectangular  thin  samples  with  different 
aspect  ratios  𝐿1  and  𝐿2.  The  values  of  the  potential  and 
electric field were collected by performing a sweep around 
the A-D-C-B path shown in Figure 2a. 

FIG.  4.  Electric  field  (upper  curve)  and  electric  potential  (lower  curve) 
along A-D-C-B path for the sample with 𝐿1 = 12 m and 𝐿2 = 5 m. 

Electric  field  (upper  curve)  is  related  to  electric 
potential (lower curve) by 𝐸⃗  = −∇𝑉. Interesting is to note 
that the electric potential has saddle points at corners C and 
D,  where  the  electric  field  vanishes  (see  arrows).  At  the 
middle point of the D-C path (𝑥 = 0), the electric potential 
is maximum and the electrical potential is zero, as expected 
due to the symmetric arguments. The same general behavior 
has been observed for all the simulated samples. 

FIG. 3. Electric potential (a) and electric field (b) as a function of position 
along the A-D-C-B path for four different samples. The origin was defined 
at the midpoint of the D-C line.      

Near the negative and positive poles (A and B corners) 
the values of electric fields and potentials vary strongly as a 
function of the position. On the other hand, in the opposite 
side of the samples (D-C path), both 𝑉 and 𝐸 are orders of 
magnitude  smaller.  Furthermore,  it  is  observed  that  the 
shape of the curve for the different sizes are very similar and 
can be easily collapsed (not shown).   

The  Figure  4  shows  the  electric  field  and  electric 
potential  in  logarithm  scales  for  the  A-D-C-B  path  of  the 
sample with 𝐿1 = 12 m and 𝐿2 = 5 m.  

FIG. 5. Electric potential along the D-C path for the samples 𝐿1   ×   𝐿2 =
5  ×  5, 5  ×  12, 12  ×  5, and 12  ×  12. Red solid lines are fits based on 
Equation (5). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To have a deep insight about the electric behavior in 
the D-C path, in Figure 5 is plotted the electric potential for 
the four samples. 

Considering the zero electric potential at 𝑥 = 0 and the 
two saddle points at 𝑥 = ±𝐿1/2, the behavior of the 𝑉(𝑥) 
must  be  described  by  a  third  order  polynomial,  whose 
boundary conditions impose that 

𝑉(𝑥) =

Figure 5 also displays the fits based on Equation (5) 
(red solid lines). The agreement is excellent and allows one 
to determine the 𝑉1 = 𝑉C − 𝑉D value for each sample with 
high precision either by using the polynomial fit or from the 
saddle points. 

In Figure 6 is shown a set of electric potential curves 
as a function of the position for samples with a fixed D-C 
distance (𝐿1 = 5 m) and different 𝐿2.  

FIG. 6. Electric potential curves as a function of the position for samples 
with a fixed D-C distance (𝐿1 = 5 m) and different 𝐿2.  

It is easy to notice that the saddle points are in the same 
position for all the samples as indicated by the small black 
solid circles at  𝑥 = ± 2.5 m. Similar behaviors have been 
observed  for  samples  with  different  𝐿1  values,  which 
demonstrate  this  is  a  general  behavior  of  the  rectangular 
samples  in  the  Montgomery  method.14  As  previously 
mentioned,  this  would  be  difficult  to  be  performed 
experimentally. Thanks to COMSOL Multiphysics software 
which  allowed  us  to  do  this  type  of  simulation  for  many 
samples very fast. 

As  reported  in  previous  paper,14,  17  there  is  a  simple 
relationship  between  the  thin  rectangular  sample  and  its 
the  modified 
electrical  resistance.  This 
Montgomery method (see Equation (10) of the reference 17)

In order to check the validity of the Equation (6) for 
the simulation data obtained in this work, in Figure 7(a) is 
plotted the 𝑉1 values obtained as described in Figure 5 as a 
function of the  1/sinh(𝜋 𝐿2 𝐿1)⁄
 in the limit  𝐿2 𝐿1 ≥ 0.5
for  four  different  metallic  materials  (Cu,  Al,  Pt,  and  Hg). 
For this particular case, a constant electrical current of 1 A 
was used in the simulations of the thin samples (𝐿3 = 1 m).

of the four metals as a function of the slope obtained from the inset of the 
Figure (a). The red dot line represents the behavior predicted by Equation 
(6). 

The  linear  behavior  observed  in  both  log-log  (main 
panel) and linear (inset) scales in the Figure 7(a) for all the 
metals  unambiguously  demonstrate  that  the  Equation  (6) 
describes  the  simulated  data  pretty  well.  Furthermore,  by 
plotting the electrical resistivity as a function of the  slope 
obtained  from  inset  of  the  Figure  7(a),  as  displayed  in 
Figure 7(b), shows an excellent agreement with pre-factor 
(𝜋 8⁄ ) predicted in the Equation (6). 

Finally, we have noticed that the results shown in this 
work allow us to suggest a simple and precise method for

determining the electrical resistivity of isotropic conductors, 
especially when sample is like a thin rectangular block (𝐿1 
is comparable to 𝐿2 and 𝐿3 ≪ √𝐿1𝐿2). In such a case, the 
following advantages have been observed with regard to the 
conventional  4P  method:  i)  contacts  can  be  placed  at  the 
corners of the samples becoming easier to handle with and 
avoiding  short  circuits;  and  ii)  precision  to  determine 
electrical resistivity can be improved since the samples can 
be bigger and contact smaller than in the 4P method, as well 
as avoids misorientation in the contacts. 

Just  to  check  the  method  proposed  here,  we  have 
revisited  the  experimental  data  reported  previously  for 
copper  plates  and  aluminum  foils  (see  reference  17)  to 
compare  with  the  sheet  resistance  (𝜌/𝐿3)  predicted  by 
Equation (6). The agreement is excellent demonstrating that 
is  easy  to  use  Equation  (6)  for  determining  the  electrical 
resistivity of isotropic rectangular samples. 

IV. CONCLUSIONS 

This work provides a simple method for measuring the 
electrical  resistivity  of  rectangular  isotropic  samples.  The 
simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics software allowed 
us to study the Montgomery method in much more detailed 
never reported before, especially with regard to the behavior 
of the electric potential and the electric field of the simulated 
samples. The simulations proved that the analytical method 
previously reported can be used in many practical situations. 
The results show that the method reported here can be easily 
used in substitution to the conventional four-probe method.
