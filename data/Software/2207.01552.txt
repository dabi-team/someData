Summary

In epidemiological cohort studies, the relative risk (also known as risk ratio) is a
major measure of association to summarize the results of two treatments or expo-

sures. Generally, it measures the relative change in disease risk as a result of treatment
application. Standard approaches to estimating relative risk available in common

software packages may produce biased inference when applied to correlated binary
data collected from longitudinal or clustered studies. In recent years, several methods

for estimating the risk ratio for correlated binary data have been published, some of

which maintain a well-controlled coverage probability but do not maintain an appro-
priate interval width or the interval location to measure the balance between distal

and mesial noncoverage probabilities accurately or, vice versa. This paper develops
eﬃcient and straightforward inference procedures for estimating a conﬁdence inter-

val for risk ratio based on a hybrid method. In general, the hybrid method combines
two separate conﬁdence intervals for two single risk rates to form a hybrid conﬁdence

interval for their ratio. Additionally, we propose the procedures for constructing a
conﬁdence interval for risk ratio that directly extends recently recommended meth-

ods for correlated binary data by building on the concepts of the design eﬀect and
eﬀective sample sizes typically used in representative sample surveys. In order to

investigate the performance of these proposed methods, we conduct an extensive sim-
ulation study. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed methods, we present three

examples from real-life applications, comparing the side eﬀects of low-dose tricyclic
antidepressants with a placebo, the eﬃcacy of the treatment group in a teratologi-

cal experiment, and the eﬃciency of the active drugs in curing infection for clinical

trials.

INTRODUCTION

Nath, Saha, and Wang

It is common to encounter correlated binary data in a wide range of biomedical applications. For example, consider the tricyclic
antidepressants study that was ﬁrst introduced by Furukawa et al. 1. The tricyclic antidepressant is a ﬁrst-generation antidepres-
sant that is used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and chronic pain 2. In each group, 16 studies were included,
each considered a cluster 3. A total of 667 eligible patients were included in the treatment group and 591 eligible patients were
included in the placebo group with mean cluster sizes of 42 and 37 respectively. This randomized trial was designed primarily
to assess the side eﬀects of low dosage tricyclic antidepressants with placebo in acute depression. Consider another study that
Paul conducted in 1982 4. In this toxicological study, results relate to litters of diﬀerent sizes, each of which exhibits a number of
abnormalities due to the control group and medium dose. Accordingly, individuals within the same litter respond similarly and
are therefore correlated. This study has a moderate number of clusters with an average cluster size of 8. One purpose of such
a study is to evaluate whether the treatment has any eﬀect on the incidence of abnormalities in live foetuses. Let 𝛾𝑖, 𝑖 = 1, 2,
be the proportion of abnormalities in live foetuses who received the 𝑖th treatment. Then the risk ratio, 𝜂 = 𝛾1∕𝛾2, will deter-
mine whether the treatment aﬀects the incidence of abnormalities in live foetuses. We wish to develop some eﬃcient inference
procedures for estimating 𝜂 = 𝛾1∕𝛾2 for such a design. The conﬁdence interval that does not consider the intraclass correlation
will generate an inaccurate estimate of coverage probability, expected width and distal noncoverage as a percentage of the total
coverage probability, resulting in an inappropriate conﬁdence interval. This problem makes it impossible to apply the standard
analysis which is based on the assumption that observations within clusters are independent 5 6. Several important measures of
association can be used to determine this inference problem, including risk diﬀerence, odds ratio, and risk ratio 7. An inference
can be drawn from one measure of association or another, depending on how the study was designed. A risk diﬀerence (RD) is
deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the risk of an event for exposed and unexposed groups. The risk diﬀerence can be measured
in public health issues in order to determine the magnitude of excess mortality attributed to each disease. A risk ratio is used to
measure the strength of the association between a given disease and a suspected risk factor in toxicological and epidemiological
studies. The risk ratio and odds ratio are essentially equal if the proportions of control and treatment groups are less than 0.1.
As long as the proportions of control and treatment groups are not too small, the risk ratio is often regarded as a more reliable
measure of eﬀectiveness than the odds ratio. Additionally, in applications, the risk ratio can be interpreted directly 3. In the case
of correlated binary data, a variety of inference procedures have been developed to determine the risk diﬀerence and the risk
ratio; however, little attention has been given to the extension of the numerous existing procedures. In this paper, we focus on
minimizing this gap by extending some of the recommended procedures for a single proportion to the ratio of the proportions
in two treatment groups.

Lui presented four methods for calculating a conﬁdence interval for a risk ratio 7. In 2010, Paul and Zaihra 5 assessed Lui’s
four methods by comparing them with a method using an estimator of the variance of the ratio estimator 8 as well as with
another using a sandwich estimator for the variance of the regression estimator 9 and concluded that the method (MR3) that
focuses on variance of ratio estimator performs best overall for constructing conﬁdence intervals for risk ratios. In general, the
method performs reasonably well, but it may not be appropriate for cases with higher risk ratios and large intracluster correlation
diﬀerences. Moreover, the expected length using MR3 increases substantially when the number of clusters is small and the
intraclass correlation is greater than 0.5 5. Consider, for instance, the simulated data set presented in Table 1 which includes
both treatment and control groups. In this situation, the expected length of the conﬁdence interval using MR3 is unexpectedly
large. Note that the intracluster correlations for the treatment and control groups are 0.35 and 0.12, respectively. In addition,
the conﬁdence interval does not exist for MR3 in some scenarios. According to Zaihra and Paul 5, MR3 rejects 16511 samples
before it takes 10,000 good samples, based on particular parameter settings. For example, consider the simulated data set for
treatment and control groups in Table 2. In this instance, the conﬁdence interval using MR3 does not exist. Real-life examples
may contain these types of data, so MR3 would not be applicable to such instances.

Furthermore, even though MR3 maintains a well-controlled coverage probability in most scenarios, it does not maintain New-
combe’s 10 recommended ratio of distal noncoverage probability to mesial noncoverage probability for the conﬁdence interval.
In order to address these issues, we propose several alternative conﬁdence interval procedures for the risk ratio by modifying
the recommended binomial intervals for correlated binary data based on the hybrid technique and the eﬀective sample size and
its adjusted number of successes. In this paper, we construct several explicit asymptotic two-sided conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for
𝜂 = 𝛾1∕𝛾2 using the method of variance of estimates recovery (MOVER) proposed by Zou and Donner 11 and also known as the
square-and-add method introduced by Newcombe 12. The basic idea is to recover variance estimates required for the proportion
ratio from the conﬁdence limits for single proportions. The CI estimators for a single proportion, which are incorporated with
the MOVER, will include the CIs proposed by Donner and Klar 13, Lee and Dubin 14, Jung and Ahn (2000) 15, and Saha et al. 16.
Katz et al., 17 in 1978, estimated a conﬁdence interval for the risk ratio, which was later modiﬁed by Walter and Pettigrew 18 19.
Based on the eﬀective sample size and its adjusted success rate, we extend this conﬁdence interval. In Section 2.2, we describe
how we adjust the eﬀective sample size and the number of successes using three diﬀerent variances. Newcombe 20 proposed a
method for calculating conﬁdence intervals for the risk ratio which is based on inverse sine transformation. Koopman 21 proposed
an asymptotic scoring method for determining conﬁdence intervals for the risk ratio. Lui 7 developed an asymptotic conﬁdence
interval for the risk ratio based on Fieller’s Theorem. The improvement of the method is obtained by applying the Katz logarithm
transformation 17. Additionally, Lui proposed an asymptotic conﬁdence interval based on Bailey’s 7. This paper extends these
four existing methods, each with three diﬀerent eﬀective sample sizes and adjusted success rates to construct conﬁdence intervals
for the risk ratio, as discussed in Section 2.2.

The following section describes these 16 methods for estimating the conﬁdence interval for the risk ratio for the correlated
data. MR3 will also be discussed as a baseline method. A comprehensive simulation study is presented in Section 3 by showing
8 out of the 17 methods, based on the simulation results and the properties of the conﬁdence intervals. Furthermore, we illustrate
three examples of real-world applications to validate our proposed models in Section4. Finally, some concluding remarks are
given in Section 5.

CONFIDENCE INTERVAL FOR THE RATIO OF TWO SUCCESS RATES

Suppose that we independently sample 𝑚𝑖 clusters from the 𝑖th treatment, 𝑖 = 1, 2. Let 𝑛𝑖𝑗 be the number of individuals in the 𝑗th
cluster, 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑚𝑖, who received the 𝑖th treatment. Furthermore, suppose that 𝑌𝑖𝑗 of the 𝑛𝑖𝑗 individuals are total successes by
𝑝𝑖𝑗 follows binomial (𝑛𝑖𝑗, 𝑝𝑖𝑗), where 𝑝𝑖𝑗 is the probability that an individual in
the 𝑖th treatment. Under the usual assumption 𝑌𝑖𝑗
the 𝑗th cluster was cured by the 𝑖th treatment. We further assume that the binomial probability 𝑝𝑖𝑗 is a random variable having
mean 𝛾𝑖 and variance 𝛾𝑖(1 − 𝛾𝑖)𝜃𝑖. The unconditional mean and variance of 𝑌𝑖𝑗 are then 𝑛𝑖𝑗𝛾𝑖 and 𝑛𝑖𝑗𝑝𝑖𝑗(1 − 𝑝𝑖𝑗)[1 + (𝑛𝑖𝑗 − 1)𝜃𝑖],
respectively. Note that the parameter 𝛾𝑖 is the success rate of an individual who received the 𝑖th treatment and the parameter 𝜃𝑖
is the common intraclass correlation between the binary observations within each cluster in the 𝑖th group. In this article, the

parameter of interest is 𝜂 = 𝛾1∕𝛾2. In particular, we would like to construct explicitly simple but eﬃcient conﬁdent interval
procedures of 𝜂. The following subsections explain how we develop eﬀective and reliable conﬁdence interval procedures for the
risk ratio between two proportions for correlated binary data.

2.1 Hybrid Method

A hybrid method is called the method of variance estimates recovery (MOVER), which was ﬁrst developed by Zou and Donner 11.
Newcombe 12 also referred to it as the square-and-add method. Using this approach, two separate conﬁdence intervals for the
two individual success rates are combined to construct a single conﬁdence interval for the ratio of two success rates, 𝜂 = 𝛾𝑖∕𝛾2.
In order to construct a conﬁdence interval for 𝜂, ﬁrst consider a 100(1 − 𝛼)% CI for 𝛾1 − 𝛾2, where 𝛾1 and 𝛾2 denote any two
parameters of interest. Let ̂𝛾1 and ̂𝛾2 be two estimates of 𝛾1 and 𝛾2 from two samples independent of each other, respectively. By
the Central Limit Theorem, a 100(1 − 𝛼)% CI for 𝛾1 − 𝛾2 is given by (𝐿∗, 𝑈 ∗), where
var(̂𝛾1) + var(̂𝛾2) and 𝑈 ∗ = ̂𝛾1 − ̂𝛾2 + 𝑧𝛼∕2
However, this procedure performs well only if the sample size is suﬃciently large, or if the sampling distributions of ̂𝛾𝑖 (𝑖 = 1, 2)
are close to a normal distribution. From the equations above, it can be shown that 𝐿∗ and 𝑈 ∗ can be regarded as the minimum
and maximum parameter values that satisfy

𝐿∗ = ̂𝛾1 − ̂𝛾2 − 𝑧𝛼∕2

var(̂𝛾1) + var(̂𝛾2).

√

√

[𝑈 ∗ − (̂𝛾1 − ̂𝛾2)]2
[(̂𝛾1 − ̂𝛾2) − 𝐿∗]2
var(̂𝛾1) + var(̂𝛾2)
var(̂𝛾1) + var(̂𝛾2)
respectively. Suppose a 100(1 − 𝛼)% CI for 𝛾𝑖 is (𝑙𝑖, 𝑢𝑖), 𝑖 = 1, 2, where 𝑙𝑖 = ̂𝛾𝑖 − 𝑧𝛼∕2
𝛼∕2
under 𝛾𝑖 ≈ 𝑙𝑖. Similarly, 𝑢𝑖 = ̂𝛾𝑖 + 𝑧𝛼∕2
𝛼∕2 under 𝛾𝑖 ≈ 𝑢𝑖. Based on the possible values
(𝑙1, 𝑢1) of 𝛾1 and (𝑙2, 𝑢2) of 𝛾2, the values closest to the minimum 𝐿 and maximum 𝑈 are 𝑙2 − 𝑢1 and 𝑢2 − 𝑙1, respectively. As a
√
result, to set 𝐿 with 𝛾2 ≈ 𝑙2 and 𝛾1 ≈ 𝑢1, we have ̂var(̂𝛾1) + ̂var(̂𝛾2) = (𝑢1 − ̂𝛾1)2∕𝑧2

var(̂𝛾𝑖) implies ̂var(̂𝛾𝑖) = (𝑢𝑖 − ̂𝛾𝑖)2∕𝑧2

var(̂𝛾𝑖) implies ̂var(̂𝛾𝑖) = (̂𝛾𝑖 − 𝑙𝑖)2∕𝑧2

𝛼∕2 and

𝛼∕2 + (̂𝛾2 − 𝑙2)2∕𝑧2

𝛼∕2, which gives

= 𝑧2

= 𝑧2

𝛼∕2,

√

Similarly, we have

𝐿∗ ≈ ̂𝛾1 − ̂𝛾2 −

(̂𝛾2 − 𝑙2)2 + (𝑢1 − ̂𝛾1)2.

√

𝑈 ∗ ≈ ̂𝛾1 − ̂𝛾2 +

(𝑢2 − ̂𝛾2)2 + (̂𝛾1 − 𝑙1)2.

Now, let (𝐿, 𝑈 ) be the (1 − 𝛼)100% conﬁdence interval for 𝜂 = 𝛾𝑖∕𝛾2, that is,
𝑃 (𝐿 ≤ 𝛾1∕𝛾2 ≤ 𝑈 ) = 1 − 𝛼.

√

Equivalently,

(1)

(2)

𝑃 (𝛾1 − 𝑈 𝛾2 ≤ 0 ≤ 𝛾2 − 𝐿𝛾1) = 1 − 𝛼.
For ﬁxed 𝐿 and 𝑈 , we apply (1) to 𝛾1 − 𝑈 𝛾2 and (2) to 𝛾2 − 𝐿𝛾1 and by setting 𝐿∗ = 0 and 𝑈 ∗ = 0, we obtain an approximate
(1 − 𝛼)100% conﬁdence interval for 𝜂 = 𝛾𝑖∕𝛾2 as

𝐿 =

̂𝛾1 ̂𝛾2 −

(̂𝛾1 ̂𝛾2)2 − 𝑢2(2 ̂𝛾1 − 𝑙1)𝑙1(2 ̂𝛾2 − 𝑢2)

√

𝑢2(2 ̂𝛾2 − 𝑢2)

(3)

and

̂𝛾1 ̂𝛾2 +

(̂𝛾1 ̂𝛾2)2 − 𝑢1(2 ̂𝛾1 − 𝑢1)𝑙2(2 ̂𝛾2 − 𝑙2)

.

𝑈 =

(4)

𝑙2(2 ̂𝛾2 − 𝑙2)
For the equations above, the restrictions 𝑢2(2 ̂𝛾2 − 𝑢2) > 0, 𝑙2(2 ̂𝛾2 − 𝑙2) > 0, (̂𝛾1 ̂𝛾2)2 > 𝑢2(2 ̂𝛾1 − 𝑙1)𝑙1(2 ̂𝛾2 − 𝑢2), and (̂𝛾1 ̂𝛾2)2 >
𝑢1(2 ̂𝛾1 − 𝑢1)𝑙2(2 ̂𝛾2 − 𝑙2) are required in order to avoid negative or complex values for 𝐿 and 𝑈 .

√

It is easily seen that to obtain a 100(1 − 𝛼)% MOVER based conﬁdence interval for 𝜂 = 𝛾1∕𝛾2 using Equations (3) and (4),
one needs two separate 100(1 − 𝛼)% conﬁdence intervals: (𝑙1, 𝑢1) for 𝛾1 and (𝑙2, 𝑢2) for 𝛾2. In the study of conﬁdence intervals
for clustered binary data, Saha et al. 16 examined the problem of conﬁdence intervals for a single proportion. Based on their
analysis, they recommended the Wilson score method.

The natural estimator of 𝛾𝑖 (𝑖 = 1, 2) can easily be obtained as the overall sample proportion ̂𝛾𝑖 = 𝑌𝑖.∕𝑛𝑖., where 𝑌𝑖. =
𝑛𝑖𝑗[1+(𝑛𝑖𝑗 −1)𝜃𝑖]∕𝑛𝑖.. Using the Central
and 𝑛𝑖. =
Limit Theorem, it can be shown that 𝑛1∕2
𝛾𝑖(1 − 𝛾𝑖) ̂𝜉𝑖 converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution
as 𝑚 = min{𝑚1, 𝑚2} → ∞, where ̂𝜉𝑖 is obtained by replacing 𝜃𝑖 by its estimate ̂𝜃𝑖. Then the approximate 100(1 − 𝛼)% Wilson
conﬁdence interval for 𝛾𝑖 is the root of the quadratic equation

𝑚𝑖
𝑗=1 𝑛𝑖𝑗. The variance of ̂𝛾𝑖 is given by var(̂𝛾𝑖) = 𝛾𝑖(1−𝛾𝑖)𝜉𝑖∕𝑛𝑖., where 𝜉𝑖 =

It is worthwhile to note here that for non-clustered data when there is no cluster eﬀect, that is, 𝜃𝑖 = 0 (or 𝜉𝑖 = 1), the same intervals
are produced (see, for example, Newcombe 12). The estimate ̂𝜃𝑖 can be obtained using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method,
which is given by ̂𝜃𝑎

Eﬀective sample size based on consistent estimator of variance for correlated binary data

In general, if 𝑌𝑖. ∼ 𝐵(𝑛𝑖, 𝛾𝑖), the variance of ̂𝛾𝑖 is 𝛾𝑖(1 − 𝛾𝑖)∕𝑛𝑖. However, due to intracluster correlation, the variance of the
observed response rate inﬂates the usual variance 6. We estimate eﬀective sample size, 𝑛𝑖, and its adjusted number of success,
𝑌𝑖, based on a complex variance estimator by incorporating unequal and equal weights, and a robust estimator of the variance
of a ratio estimator. Here is an overview of the three variance estimators and corresponding eﬀective sample sizes:

Λ =

Ψ(𝜂) =

(𝑌1. − 𝑛1.Λ)2
𝑛1.Λ(1 − Λ)

An asymmetric conﬁdence interval for the risk ratio is deﬁned as (𝜂𝑙, 𝜂𝑟), which is solved by a numerical procedure of the
following equation:

Ψ(𝜂) = 𝜒 2

1,1−𝛼.

In Equations (7) and (8), we replace the value of (𝑛𝑖., 𝑌𝑖.) with three sets of eﬀective sample sizes and the adjusted numbers of
successes (𝑛𝑒𝑞

Conﬁdence interval based on modiﬁed Delta and Katz asymptotic method

2.2.4
Lui 7 developed a conﬁdence interval for the risk ratio using Delta 25 method as follows:

where ̂var( ̂𝜂) = ̂𝜂2[(1 − ̂𝛾1)∕(𝑛1 ̂𝛾1) + (1 − ̂𝛾2)∕(𝑛2 ̂𝛾2)], and 𝑧𝛼 is the upper 100𝛼th percentile of the standard normal distribution.
However, the estimated risk ratio can be skewed if both the sample sizes 𝑛𝑖 and probabilities of success 𝛾𝑖 are small. In such a
case, the Katz logarithm transformation 17 often improves the asymptotic conﬁdence interval:

max

̂𝜂 ± 𝑧𝛼∕2

)

̂var( ̂𝜂), 0

,

where

̂𝜂 exp

(10)

̂var(log( ̂𝜂)) = (1 − ̂𝛾1)∕(𝑛1 ̂𝛾1) + (1 − ̂𝛾2)∕(𝑛2 ̂𝛾2).
(11)
In Equation (11), we replace the value of (𝑛𝑖., 𝑌𝑖.) with three sets of eﬀective sample sizes and the adjusted numbers of successes
(𝑛𝑒𝑞

𝑖. ) and refer to these methods as DK1, DK2, and DK3, respectively.

Conﬁdence interval based on modiﬁed Fieller and Bailey asymptotic method

2.2.5
According to Lui 7, an asymptotic conﬁdence interval was developed for the risk ratio using Fieller’s Theorem, as follows:

[max

(𝑏 −

𝑏2 − 𝑎𝑐)∕𝑎, 0

, (𝑏 +

𝑏2 − 𝑎𝑐)∕𝑎]; 𝑎 > 0, and 𝑏2 − 𝑎𝑐 > 0,

where

(

√

)
𝑎 = ̂𝛾 2

√
2 − 𝑧2
𝛼∕2 ̂𝛾2(1 − ̂𝛾2)∕𝑛2,

𝑏 = ̂𝛾1 ̂𝛾2,
𝑐 = ̂𝛾 2

1 − 𝑧2

𝛼∕2 ̂𝛾1(1 − ̂𝛾1)∕𝑛1.

(12)

(13)

As a result of Bailey’s suggestion, the asymptotic conﬁdence interval for the risk ratio is presented as follows in order to reduce
the skewness of the sampling distribution 7:

[max

((𝐵 −

𝐵2 − 𝐴𝐶)∕𝐴)3, 0

, ((𝐵 +

𝐵2 − 𝐴𝐶)∕𝐴)3]; 𝐴 > 0, and 𝐵2 − 𝐴𝐶 > 0,

(14)

where

(

√

√
𝛼∕2(1 − ̂𝛾2)∕(9𝑛2 ̂𝛾 1∕3

2

)
𝐴 = ̂𝛾 2∕3
2 − 𝑧2
𝐵 = (̂𝛾1 ̂𝛾2)1∕3,
𝐶 = ̂𝛾 2

),

(15)

𝑖. , and 𝑛𝑟𝑒

𝑖. and refer to these methods as FB1,

).
In Equation (15), we replace the value of 𝑛𝑖. with three eﬀective sample sizes 𝑛𝑒𝑞
𝑖. , 𝑛𝑜𝑝
FB2, and FB3, respectively.

𝛼∕2(1 − ̂𝛾1)∕(9𝑛1 ̂𝛾 1∕3

1 − 𝑧2

Zaihra and Paul 5 developed this method by modifying Equation (13) in the following manner:

𝑎 = ̂𝛾 2

2 − 𝑧2

𝛼∕2𝑣𝑟𝑒
2 ,

𝑏 = ̂𝛾1 ̂𝛾2,
𝑐 = ̂𝛾 2

1 − 𝑧2
Using these 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 and Equation (12), we can obtain a resulting asymptotic conﬁdence interval. Zaihra and Paul referred to
it as MR3 5.

𝛼∕2𝑣𝑟𝑒

In the following sections we will evaluate and compare 17 ways of constructing conﬁdence intervals (ﬁve approaches with
three diﬀerent combinations of eﬀective sample sizes and its eﬀective success rates). A list of 15 out of the 17 ways is given in
Table 3 together with their acronyms for ease of reference. Further, hybrid method HB1, as discussed in section 2.1 , will be
included in the study along with the baseline method MR3.

In this section, we investigate the performance of the small and moderate sample behavior of the proposed methods in terms
of expected coverage probability and expected interval width using the pre-assigned conﬁdence level of 95%. Furthermore, we
consider the interval location property as well, to ensure symmetry between the distal and mesial noncoverage probabilities.
In addition to the 16 conﬁdence intervals discussed in Section 2, we consider MR3 as a baseline, which was proposed by Paul
and Zaihra 5 and discussed in Subsection 2.2.5. We will select parameter combinations so that the generated data sets of two
treatment groups will cover all possible scenarios in the three real-world examples.

3.1

Parameter selection and data generation

For simplicity, we consider two treatment groups with the numbers of clusters 𝑛1 = 𝑛2 = 20, 30, 50 and cluster sizes 𝑚1 = 𝑚2 =
5, 50, 100. We used a baseline proportion, 𝛾1 = 0.2, along with 𝜂 = 1, 1.25, 1.5, and 2. The intraclass correlation coeﬃcients
between two treatment groups (𝜃1, 𝜃2) were set to (0.1, 0.1), (0.1, 0.25), (0.2, 0.2), and (0.2, 0.25). We generated data sets from
beta-binomial distributions by combining each set of parameters for both treatments, allowing a total of 10,000 good replications
in which the conﬁdence interval existed for all 17 methods discussed above.

3.2

Results

The observed coverage probability (CP), the expected interval width (EW), and distal noncoverage as a proportion of the total
noncoverage probability (DNPTNP) for two-sided conﬁdence intervals (𝑙, 𝑢) for 𝜂 = 𝛾1∕𝛾2 were obtained by 16 26 10

The boxplots in Figure 1 depict the observed CPs, EWs, and DNPTNPs for the 17 methods for various parameter settings. Each
boxplot contains a combination of (𝑁𝑛 = 3) × (𝑁𝑚 = 3) × (𝑁𝜂 = 4) × (𝑁𝜃1∶𝜃2
= 4) = 144 parameter. In order to observe how
these methods perform overall, we also report the median of the CPs, EWs, and the DNPTNPs in Table 4. According to this
table, MK3, IH1, KA1, KA2, DK1, DK2, FB1, FB2, and IH2 have median CPs near 0.95, and MK1, MK2, IH3, KA3, DK3,
FB3, HB1, and MR3 have median CPs slightly oﬀ from 0.95, but all the median CPs are well controlled. The expected width of
all of the methods is similar. As can be seen from the expected width plot, MR3’s expected width intervals are remarkably large

compared with those of the other EWs. It has also been reported by Zaihra and Paul 5 in their original paper that when the number
of clusters is small and the intraclass correlation is high, the expected width by MR3 is substantially larger. The remaining 16
methods have very similar expected widths. However, FB1 and FB2 have slightly wider expected widths. MK3, IH3, KA3, DK3,
FB3, and HB1 have shorter widths than the others, which is indicative of their superior precision. All of the DNPTNPs are very
close to 0.5 except MR3. However, the DNPTNP for MR3 is at the very edge of the recommended range between 0.375 and
0.625. As observed in Figure 1, the DNPTNP can be far outside this recommended interval in some scenarios. We also observe
in Figure 1 that in some scenarios IH3, KA3, DK3, FB3, and HB1 have lower CPs than 0.95, whereas MK1, MK2 have higher
CPs. In almost all areas, IH1, IH2, KA1, KA2, DK1, DK2, FB1, FB2, and MR3 maintain well-controlled CPs. We can also see
in Figure 1 that MR3 has the largest expected width of the conﬁdence interval. To investigate the performance of the CPs of
each method under diﬀerent scenarios of risk ratio and intracluster correlation, we provide box plots in Figure 2. Each boxplot
contains (𝑁𝑛 = 3) × (𝑁𝑚 = 3) = 9 parameter combinations under the baseline proportion of 𝛾1 = 0.2. In addition, we observe
that the methods IH3, KA3, DK3, FB3, HB1, and the baseline method MR3 struggle to maintain the nominal conﬁdence level
for higher risk ratios, unequal and larger intracluster correlations. For simplicity, we select MK3, IH2, KA2, DK2, DK3, FB2,
HB1, and MR3 as our baseline methods, and for now, we will focus only on these methods for further analysis.

The mean CP of each of the four combinations of 𝜃1 and 𝜃2 is plotted against the risk ratio in Figure 3 to observe the association

between the risk ratio and intracluster correlation. Each shape in a line contains an average of (𝑁𝑛 = 3) × (𝑁𝑚 = 3) = 9
CPs. We observe from these plots that all methods except MR3 and HB1 maintain well-controlled coverage probabilities. In
the presence of unequal intracluster correlations (𝜃1 = 0.1 & 𝜃2 = 0.25), and a risk ratio larger than 1.5, the CPs of MR3
and HB1 are smaller than 0.94. We also observe that HB1 displays liberal CPs for intracluster correlations of 0.2 and 0.25 and
a risk ratio more than 1.5. Moreover, CPs for MK3, DK2, IH2, and Fb2 are very close to the nominal interval level in all of
the scenarios. MR3 consistently provides larger EWs in all scenarios. In particular, for 𝜃1 = 0.2, 𝜃2 = 0.25, and 𝜂 = 2, MR3
provides an exceedingly large EW value. To assess the balance between distal (DISNCP) and mesial (MESNCP) noncoverages,
we present line plots of DNPTNP=(DISNCP/(DISNCP+MESNCP) in Figure 5. Each shape of a line consists of an average of
nine DNPTNPs. According to Newcombe 10, the interval location is satisfactory if DNPTNP is within a range of 0.375 to 0.625.
There are two horizontal red lines in the plot representing these values. In all scenarios, all of the methods except for MR3
preserve a balance between distal and mesial noncoverages. Moreover, IH2, KA2, DK2, DK3, and HB1 maintain a well-balanced
DNPTNP, which is 0.5 in all scenarios.

Example 1: Tricyclic Antidepressants Study

Consider the tricyclic antidepressant study ﬁrst introduced by Furukawa et al. 1, and was subsequently analyzed by Bakbergenuly
et al. 3. The use of tricyclic antidepressants continues to be widespread around the world. A common criticism of practicing
physicians and psychiatrists is that they administer tricyclic antidepressants at too low a dosage to those with depression. In adults
with major depressive disorder, tricyclic antidepressants have been associated with a wide range of adverse eﬀects. However, no
systematic evaluation of the serious or non-serious adverse eﬀects associated with all types of tricyclic antidepressants has been
conducted 27. The study aims to compare the side eﬀects of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants with a placebo. The empirical
distributions of cluster level proportions for treatment and placebo are shown in Figure 6. Estimated success probabilities for
low dosage tricyclic antidepressants and placebo are 0.604 and 0.390, respectively. The ANOVA estimates for the intercluster
correlation coeﬃcients for the intervention and control groups are 0.169 and 0.164, respectively. According to Bakbergenuly
et al. 3, there was a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the treatment group and the placebo group. Before we use our
proposed methods, we need to conﬁrm whether they are appropriate for this example. By using the same parameter combinations
as in this example, we conducted simulations using the technique described in Section 3. We obtained coverage probabilities,
expected widths, and distal noncoverages of the 95% conﬁdence intervals for the risk ratio by all 8 selected methods based on
̂𝛾𝑡 = 0.604, ̂𝜂 = ̂𝛾𝑡∕ ̂𝛾𝑝 = 1.545 , 𝑛𝑡 = 16, 𝑚𝑡 = 41.68 , 𝑛𝑝 = 16, and 𝑚𝑝 = 36.93 as shown in Table 5. HB1 and MR3 have
liberal CPs, while the remainder have well-controlled CPs(close to 0.95). In our simulation study, we observed similar coverage
probabilities for all the methods in Figure 2(L). The expected widths of all the methods are also similar. Each DNPTNP is very
close to 0.5, with the exception of MR3, which is 0.406, but within the recommended range between 0.375 and 0.625 10. This
result supports the use of these methods in this situation, leading to the usage of the conﬁdence intervals of all 8 methods.
According to these results, each of the 8 CIs is greater than 1, which suggests that tricyclic antidepressants have a signiﬁcant
eﬀect. All the conﬁdence widths are similar, however as expected from our simulation study, DK3, MK3, and IH2 have shorter
widths. By contrast, HB1 followed by MR3 have a larger width. Based on the data analysis in this scenario, it appears that MK3,
IH2, DK2, and DK3 are most likely to provide precise and accurate interval estimation.

Example 2: Teratological Experimental Study

We revisit an example of a teratological experiment that was originally conducted by Paul 4 and subsequently analysed by Saha
and Wang 6. In this study, the data refer to litters of varying sizes, each litter having a number of abnormalities due to a control
group and medium dose. Within the same litter, individuals respond in a similar manner, so they are correlated.

The empirical distributions of cluster level proportions for both treatment groups are shown in Figure 7 which indicates
that the distributions are highly skewed. Estimated success probabilities for medium and control doses are 0.344 and 0.134,
respectively. ANOVA estimates for the intracluster correlation coeﬃcients for the intervention and control groups are 0.277
and 0.218, respectively. According to Saha and Wang 6, there was a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the treatment
group and the control group. Therefore, we chose this example to evaluate the performance of our proposed method in such
a case. Before we use our proposed methods, we need to conﬁrm whether they are appropriate for this example. By using the
same parameter combinations as in this example, we conducted simulations using the technique described in Section 3. We
obtained coverage probabilities, expected widths, and mesial noncoverages of the 95% conﬁdence interval for the risk ratio by
all 8 methods based on parameter combination of ̂𝛾𝑚 = 0.344, ̂𝜂 = ̂𝛾𝑚∕ ̂𝛾𝑐 = 2.55, 𝑛𝑚 = 21, 𝑚𝑚 = 7.19, 𝑛𝑐 = 27, and 𝑚𝑐 = 7.96

16

Nath, Saha, and Wang

as shown in Table 6. According to the results, all 8 selected methods have well-controlled coverage probabilities. In accordance
with Newcombe 10, all the methods except MR3 maintain the location property as their MNPTNPs for the 95% conﬁdence
intervals for 𝜂 are between 0.375 and 0.625 while MR3’s MNPTNP is 0.275. Based on the simulation results in Figure 5(B), it
is evident that MR3 struggles to maintain the location property for higher risk ratios and for unequal intracluster correlations
(𝜃 = 0.1 & 𝜃 = 0.25). These results support the use of our proposed methods in this situation. However, the use of MR3 in this
situation should be regarded critically. None of the 95% conﬁdence intervals based on the 8 selected methods includes 1, which
suggests a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the medium dose and the control dose (which is consistent with Saha and Wang’s 6
conclusions). As expected, MK3 has the shortest interval width, and MR3 has the largest interval width in this scenario. On the
basis of our evaluation of the appropriateness of the models and the width of the conﬁdence intervals, we conclude that models
MK3, IH2, KA2, DK2, DK3, and HB1 provide the most reliable conﬁdence intervals for 𝜂.

Example 3: Active drug’s eﬀectiveness in curing infection

Consider the example of the multicenter randomized clinical trial, which was ﬁrst introduced by Beitler and Landis 28. In this
clinical trial, an active anti-infective drug was compared with a control drug to determine if it eﬀectively treats infections. In this
example, eight clinics are considered clusters. The mean cluster sizes for active and control drugs are 16.25 and 17.87, respec-
tively. The empirical distributions of ̂𝛾𝑎 and ̂𝛾𝑐 are provided in Figure 8. The ANOVA estimates of the intracluster correlation
coeﬃcients for the treatment and control groups are 0.258 and 0.328, respectively. Prior to using these methods to estimate
the conﬁdence interval for 𝜂 of this example, a simulation was performed with similar parameter conﬁgurations. Based upon
the notation in Section 3, we considered the parameter combination ̂𝛾𝑎 = 0.42, ̂𝜂 = ̂𝛾𝑎
= 1.28 , 𝑛𝑎 = 𝑛𝑐 = 8, 𝑚𝑎 = 16.25
̂𝛾𝑐
and 𝑚𝑐 = 17.87. Under this combination, we obtained the coverage probabilities, expected widths and mesial noncoverages for
𝜂 at the 95% level. According to the results in Table 7, MK3 and DK3 have well-controlled coverage probabilities. A liberal
coverage probability is observed for HB1 and MR3. IH2, KA2, and FB2 have slightly higher coverage probabilities than the
well-controlled CP(0.94, 0.96), while DK3 has a conservative probability. The expected widths of all the methods are similar
except for MR3, which is unusually large compared to the other methods. HB1, MK3, IH2, DK2, and DK3 have the DNPTNP
values near 0.5 while MR3 has the DNPTNP value within the recommended range although very close to the lower range. Based
on these results, we recommend that our proposed methods be used in this scenario. In this situation, however, employing MR3
should be viewed critically. In this example, all the conﬁdence intervals include 1, which suggests the chances of being cured
with an active versus control drug are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. DK3 (2.24) has the shortest interval width followed by MK3
(2.28), HB1 (2.395), and IH2 (2.574). In contrast, MR3 (3.14) has the largest width followed by FB2 (2.86). We conclude that
based on our evaluation of the appropriateness of the models and the widths of the conﬁdence intervals, models MK3, DK3,
and IH2 most likely provide reliable conﬁdence intervals for 𝜂.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper proposed 16 methods to construct the conﬁdence intervals for the success ratio 𝜂 = 𝛾1∕𝛾2 for a correlated binary
data based on the hybrid procedure using the two separate CIs for a single proportion and the adjusted eﬀective sample size and
its number of successes. The 16 methods presented in this study were compared with the existing method MR3 recommended
by Zaihra and Paul 5 24 for estimating conﬁdence intervals for risk ratio for correlated binary data. In order to determine the
most appropriate method for constructing conﬁdence intervals for correlated binary data, three properties were considered: (i)
coverage probability, (ii) expected width, and (iii) the ratio of distal noncoverage probability to mesial noncoverage probability.
According to the ﬁndings of our comprehensive simulation study, for a moderate number of clusters with intraclass correlations
ranging from 0.1 to 0.25, the MK3, IH2, KA2, DK2, DK3, FB2, and MR3 maintain a well-controlled coverage probability in
almost all scenarios. In addition, we observe that HB1, MR3, and DK3 have a lower coverage probability than the nominal
level, particularly for higher risk ratios and higher intracluster correlations. According to our analysis, all the methods except
FB2 and MR3 had similar expected widths. Furthermore, when the risk ratio increases, the width of MR3 is noticeably larger
than the width of the others. In addition, all the methods except MR3 maintain the range between 0.375 and 0.625, which is
recommended by Newcombe 10. There are noteworthy ﬁndings that indicate the DNPTNPs of the MR3 decrease as the risk
ratio increases. Based on our observations, the ﬁndings of the examples and the results of the simulation study are similar. The
performance of MK3, DK3, IH2, and KA2 was well across all properties for a conﬁdence interval. However, MR3 does not

Nath, Saha, and Wang

19

meet the performance expectations in at least one scenario, which means at least one of the three properties of the conﬁdence
interval was violated. Based on the simulation and case study results, the proposed MK3, IH2, and DK3 methods generally
perform well because, in almost all scenarios, the observed CPs are close to the nominal coverage level, conﬁdence widths are
smaller and are congruent with expected widths, and DNPTNPs are close to 0.5. Therefore, we recommend the MK3, IH2, and
DK3 procedures for the risk ratio 𝜂 of correlated binary data from epidemiological cohort studies or other ﬁelds.
