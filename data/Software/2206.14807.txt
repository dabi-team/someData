within the solar system connected to such a network, we might detect them by inter-
cepting transmissions from relays at these foci. Here, we demonstrate a search across a
wide bandwidth for interstellar communication relays beyond the Sun’s innermost grav-
itational focus at 550 AU using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and Breakthrough
Listen (BL) backend. As a ﬁrst target, we searched for a relay at the focus of the Alpha
Centauri AB system while correcting for the parallax due to Earth’s orbit around the
Sun. We searched for radio signals directed at the inner solar system from such a source
in the L and S bands. Our analysis, utilizing the turboSETI software developed by BL,
did not detect any signal indicative of a non-human-made artiﬁcial origin. Further anal-

1. INTRODUCTION

The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) often focuses on looking for signs of technology
around other stars. This, however, is just one way to approach the search for ETI. Bracewell (1960)
posited that “superior communities” would send material probes to neighboring star systems for the
purpose of communication. If this is the case, we should also be searching our own solar system for
evidence of ETI. This idea is the basis of artifact SETI, or solar system SETI, (also called SETA,
the Search for Extraterrestrial Artifacts; Freitas 1983), the search for any material artifacts that may
be sent by ETI during a long-term galactic exploration eﬀort. Freitas (1983) proposed that a search
for such objects in our solar system could be carried out using telescopes, radar, infrared radiation,
direct probes, and other methods.

1.1. The Interstellar Communication Network Hypothesis

Communications between probes and their home systems across interstellar distances would require
extraordinarily high directional gains or transmitting powers to ensure that a distant receiving dish
can reliably reconstruct information packets. Eshleman (1979) proposed that the Sun’s gravitation
could be used as a lens to magnify the radiation to or from a distant source. A spacecraft beyond
550 AU along the focal line could use this eﬀect to observe and communicate at interstellar distances
using instruments comparable to those that we currently use for interplanetary communication. One
proposed application of this mechanism is to utilize the Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL) to provide
huge magniﬁcation to a telescope along the Sun’s focal line at a distance between 550 and 1000 AU
(e.g. the FOCAL mission; Maccone 1994, 2010; Maccone & Piant`a 1997).

Gillon (2014) proposed a new SETI approach to monitor the focal regions of the SGL corresponding
to nearby stars to search for communicative technology. Their hypothesis is based on two assertions
about galactic exploration. First, “Von Neumann” (self-replicating) probes (Tipler 1980) explor-
ing the Galaxy would require some communication among probes and back to the original system.
Second, in order to communicate across these interstellar distances, the explorers would create a
network of probes leveraging stars as gravitational lenses. These assumptions solve the problem of
long-distance communication across the Galaxy by eliminating long-range communication in favor of
a locally multi-nodal network connected to their nearest neighbors (Gertz 2017, 2020); this strategy
is commonly used for communication networks around the Earth, such as the Internet. Gillon (2014)
acknowledged that such devices would not likely be detectable through imaging or stellar occultation,
but that multi-wavelength monitoring may detect leaked signals.

Hippke (2020a,b, 2021) explored technical constraints involved in the conﬁguration of an interstellar
communication network using stellar gravitational lenses, in order to motivate searches at the proper
locations and sizes for nodes and probes. Their work argued that optimal probe sizes would be on the

3

order of 1 meter, the optimal communication wavelength range would be from 100 µm to 1 nm, and
that a distance of 1,000 AU from the Sun is preferred. Hippke (2020b) also notes that, in this proposed
conﬁguration, separate exploration probes would be required in order to study the inner solar system.
Kerby & Wright (2021) explore the engineering requirements and sustainability for an SGL relay to
remain in proper position, ﬁnding that such technology is feasible and noting that another observable
property of such probes may be the by-products of station-keeping propulsion. They also argued that
single stars (i.e. those with minimal gravitational perturbations from companions) were the best hosts
for such probes because their station-keeping costs were smallest.

Gillon et al. (2021) searched for a probe on the Solar focal line in communication with the Wolf
359 system, the third nearest star to our Sun and one from which Earth’s transit across the Sun
would be observable, at a time when Earth could have intercepted the transmissions. Their search
for optical signals from the solar system toward the star, as well as for an object with the position
and motion hypothesized within the extent of Uranus’ orbit (20 AU), did not reliably identify any
such probe.

1.2. Solar Gravitational Lensing for Interstellar Communication

Massive objects in the universe, such as black holes and stars, bend the trajectories of nearby
photons. This process can create a lensing eﬀect similar to a focusing element of a telescope (Einstein
1936). Gravitational lensing warps a source object’s apparent shape into two distorted images. The
distortion eﬀect centers on a ring around the lens object, called the Einstein ring, which has an
angular radius of:

(cid:19)1/2

θE =

(cid:18) 4GM DLS
c2DLDS
where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the lens object, c is the speed of light, DL
is the observer-lens distance, DS is the observer-source distance, and DLS is the lens-source distance.
In a solar gravitational lens system, the Sun is the lens, the distant star is the source, and the probe
is our origin/observer. The physical Einstein ring radius (RE = DLθE) of the solar lens should be at
least the radius of the sun. This works out to a minimum DL of roughly 550 AU, which we adopt
as our minimum possible probe distance. Figure 1 shows the layout for a probe utilizing the SGL to
send or receive messages to/from α Cen . We note that Gillon et al. (2021) argue that the use of
out-of-focus nodes at lower separations may also be worthwhile.

It may be possible to detect signals from a relay spacecraft at a distance d (cid:38) 550 AU from the
Sun if the Earth is contained within the opening angle of the probe’s outgoing transmission beam at
any point in its orbit. For target stars that lie along the ecliptic plane, the Earth will always pass
through the beam when it transits and eclipses the Sun. However, from the view of a relay oﬀ of the
ecliptic plane, Earth will always have some non-zero separation from the Sun, which its beam may
not encapsulate. From the point of view of a probe at a distance of 550 AU, the maximum angular
separation between the Earth and the Sun is 6.3(cid:48), regardless of its ecliptic latitude. A probe with an
ecliptic latitude of b sees a minimum angular separation

The Earth’s entire orbit would be in a beam for 10-cm wavelength signals for any transmitter with
diameter (cid:46) 34 m. However, Earth’s point of closest approach to the SGL line may ﬁt into smaller

beams. This is a unique feature of performing this search search at radio wavelengths. In optical
wavelengths, the focus of prior searches, the beam sizes for dishes on the order of 10m would be much
less than 6.3(cid:48). Thus, eavesdropping on optical SGL signals would only be feasible for target stars in
the ecliplic plane. Following Equation 2, for a probe opposite α Cen (b ∼ 44◦), the minimum visible
beam size at the point of closest approach would be 4.4(cid:48). This corresponds to transmitter diameter
(cid:46) 50 m.

The directional gain for a transmitting relay is

where rt is the radius of the transmitter, kt is its eﬃciency (which we assume to be of order unity),
and λ is the emitting wavelength (Maccone 2011). Hippke (2020b) suggests ∼1 meter transmitter
size for sub-mm signals, but a larger transmitter would be required to produce similar gains at radio
wavelengths. A 50m transmitter could achieve directional gains on the order of 65 dB, and even a
20 m transmitter could achieve 55 dB.

From Equations 8-9 of Maccone (2011), we ﬁnd that the gain resulting from a solar lens is:

and the lensing of the Sun, a transmitting spacecraft could achieve a total gain of Gtot = G(cid:12) × GSC
of over 120 dB, overcoming the diﬃculties of transmission across interstellar distances by focusing
transmissions into tight parallel beams.

1.3. Searching for Technology at the SGL
1.3.1. What to Look for

There have been many suggestions in the literature of purposes for probes in the solar system. The
SGL foci of nearby stars are special locations for probes because they allow access to a “Galactic
Internet,” but the purpose and functions of such probes is otherwise unconstrained.
In contrast
to classical radio SETI searches for intentional messages sent toward Earth from interstellar dis-
tances, this method primarily attempts to eavesdrop on communications between two technological
structures. We oﬀer here three suggestions from the literature on such functions and the resulting
implications for our search, but emphasize that our search is not dependent on and does not assume
the probes we seek serve such functions.

Direct interception of outgoing communication through the SGL is the obvious signal to search
for under the interstellar communication network hypothesis, but it suﬀers from some technical
limitations. For interstellar transmissions from a relay spacecraft to be detectable from the Earth,
the stellar relay must be actively transmitting when we search, such searches can only be performed
when the Earth happens to be in the beam, and/or the beam could be tightly focused on a portion
of the Einstein ring the Earth does not transit. A constantly transmitting stellar relay is more likely
to be detected from Earth than a relay that only intermittently sends signals to the target star or
local probes.

When searching for a relay, one major obstacle is determining which wavelengths would be most
appropriate for SGL lensing. Radio wavelengths are an obvious choice for interstellar communication,
due to their low energy and extinction. However, the solar corona can interfere with long wavelength
radio signals. Turyshev & Toth (2019) found that photons with λ ≥ 157 cm (ν ≤ 0.2 GHz) are
completely blocked. At shorter wavelengths, plasma refraction steers some photons away from the
focal line, decreasing signal strength (Hippke 2020b). Moving from 3 cm to 200 µm (10 GHz to 1.5
THz), the eﬀect gradually decreases. At wavelengths below ∼ 100µm (ν (cid:38) 3 THz), the decrease in
solar lens gain is negligible. For wavelengths non-negligibly but not fully blocked, the SGL could still
provide signiﬁcant gains, so these are not completely eliminated from consideration, but do make
searches for intercepted transmissions at radio or microwave frequencies less well motivated.

On the other hand, shorter wavelengths produce smaller beam widths, which would make eaves-
dropping on an SGL signal impossible for reasonable transmitter sizes and targets not near the
ecliptic plane.

In addition to sending messages via the SGL, a relay spacecraft might send signals to other probes
in the inner solar system. Indeed, such a scheme is recommended by Maccone & Antonietti (2022)
as a way to retrieve information from interstellar probes, and is reminiscent of relay schemes used by
humans’ interplanetary probes, for instance for communication with Mars landers. There is no reason
such secondary communications might not happen at diﬀerent wavelengths than the interstellar
communications through the SGL, since coronal interference is not a problem for them. It is thus
possible they would occur at radio frequencies and with beam sizes and directions that would allow

6

them to be intercepted at Earth year-round. Figure 2 shows the view of the solar system from a
probe at the Sun’s focal point for communication with α Cen.

Figure 2. View of the solar system from a probe opposite α Cen at 550 AU on the night of our observations.
The Sun lies at the origin, and the inner solar system planets’ orbits are shown. Gray ﬁlled circles indicate
beam widths for various transmitter diameters at 10-cm wavelengths. For a probe located at a distance d >
550 AU, these orbital axes would scale down by a factor of d/(550 AU).

Bracewell (1960) suggested that the purpose of a solar system probe would be to serve as a beacon,
and Freitas (1983) and others considered places where such beacons would reside. Success in inten-
tional communication SETI requires a determination of how to ﬁnd another group of beings without
being able to communicate beforehand. This requires the determination of optimal places, times,
frequencies, and other aspects of possible communication which may be chosen by the other group.
In game theory, these optimal choices are referred to as “focal points” (Schelling 1960), but we use
the term “Schelling points” in order to avoid confusion with the optical deﬁnition of focal points
(Wright 2020). The SGL focal line is a recognizable location for both humans and the residents of
nearby stars, and it is a relatively static location in the sky. Thus, it may be an optimal place to
place a beacon to intentionally attempt to make contact with technological life in the Solar System.
Beacons sent to other star systems may be a preferred method of interstellar ﬁrst contact, as it
does not immediately reveal the location of the sender, reducing risk of aggressive retaliation (Gertz
2018). An interstellar communication relay only reveals the position of the next node in the web.
By their nature, beacons are intended to be found, so a beacon at the SGL might transmit at any
frequency its constructors thought potential recipients would guess, further justifying our choice of
frequencies near the “water hole” (Oliver 1979) for this study.

For this work, our ﬁrst observations of the SGL for nearby stars as a proof-of-concept, we have
chosen to observe in L and S bands. We chose these bands for three reasons: (1) the size of beams

105051015x (arcmin)10.07.55.02.50.02.55.07.510.0y (arcmin)20m beam35m beam50m beamsunmercuryvenusearthmars7

at these frequencies allowed us to check them all in a single 1 hour session, (2) these are in or near
the “water hole” (to search for beacons), and (3) these are or are near frequencies humans use for
interplanetary communication (to search for communications with probes in the solar system).

1.3.2. Where to Look

To ﬁrst order, we expect this type of probe to lie at the antipode of some nearby star, around which
another interstellar communication network probe could reside. Initially, we neglect light travel time
considerations and place the probe at the exact antipode of the target star as we currently see it in
the sky. This position on the sky, viewed from Earth, will vary slightly based on the probe’s assumed
distance from the Sun because, being a small fraction of a parsec distant, the probes suﬀer signiﬁcant
parallax.

For observation time t, we consider the positions of the Sun and Earth in the barycentric frame,
S(t) and E(t) respectively. We also deﬁne unit vector x(t) as the direction of the target star from the
Sun. We consider Sun-probe distances, z, from 550 AU to inﬁnity. We then calculate the barycentric
frame position of the probe as:

P = S(t) − z × x(t).

(5)

Finally, on-sky coordinates of the probe are calculated from the Earth-probe vector

−→
P E = P − E(t).
Finite light travel time requires some corrections to this expected position (Seto & Kashiyama 2020).
We must consider the positions of our celestial objects at other points in time. This calculation can
be performed for two probe types: receivers and transmitters.

For a probe transmitting signals through the SGL to a star, the signal must travel to the position
the star will be one sun-star light travel time in the future. Since our naive calculation uses the
apparent position of the star at our observation time, which is where the star was one travel time
ago, we must advance the star’s position by two light travel times.

In principle, we must also consider that the probe must aim to where the sun will be when the
signal arrives, and advance its position by one Sun-probe light travel time. We neglect this eﬀect
because the maximum change it has on the position of the probe is of order 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1.

We thus calculate the transmitting probe position as:

P (transmitter) = S(t) − z × x(t + 2d/c).

(6)

where c is the speed of light.

For a probe near the sun receiving signals from a star, our naive calculation of the star’s position
is appropriate, because the signal will arrive from the apparent (retarded) position of the star, just
as other light from the star does. But for a distant probe, we need to consider that we see the probe
where it was one Earth-probe light travel time ago, when it was sitting in a position corresponding
to the star’s position one probe-Sun travel time before that. Formally, we should then retard the
star’s apparent position by a time (z +|P E|)/c, however for computational simplicity we approximate
|P E| ≈ z because the diﬀerence in times is small compared to the timescale over which the star’s
apparent position changes signiﬁcantly.
Our receiving probe position is then:

P (receiver) = S(t) − z × x(t − 2z/c),

(7)

8

This light travel time complication means that the probe position does not converge at inﬁnite
distance. Here, we assume that such a probe would not be placed further than a tenth of the
Sun-star distance.

For both types of probe we have a locus across the sky of possible locations for a probe at varying
distance z from the Sun. In general, the full extent of this line across the sky should be observed in
order to detect or rule out active communication from a probe at the target star’s SGL location.

1.4. The SGL for α Cen

In this work, we demonstrate the SGL relay SETI search method described above with a search for
a hypothetical probe in contact with α Centauri. Figure 3 shows the positions of transmitting and
receiving probes for α Cen A (the two components of α Cen are separated by less than 10(cid:48)(cid:48), which is
so much smaller than our beam that our search encompasses both components).

The observations are described in Section 2. We present the analysis of our data in Section 3. In
Section 4, we discuss the results of our analysis and additional artifact SETI searches of this type.
We conclude in Section 5.

2. α CENTAURI OBSERVATIONS WITH GBT

We selected a set of positions corresponding to the possible locations of a relay probe in communi-
cation with α Centauri, considering both the receiver position and the transmitter position. We took
observations with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in the L and S bands using the Breakthrough
Listen (BL) backend (MacMahon et al. 2018). As shown in Figure 3, we observed the region of the
sky directly opposite α Cen, placing observations along a line to account for the parallax of a probe at
ﬁnite distances from the Earth and Sun. A probe at inﬁnite distance from the Sun with no accounting
for light travel time will be positioned exactly opposite α Cen on the sky and have no parallax, but
a probe at 550 AU will be oﬀset from the exact antipode by up to six arcminutes, depending on the
position of Earth in its orbit. We trace two of these lines, as receiver and transmitter probes require
diﬀerent considerations of the light travel time between the Sun and α Cen, as described in Section
1.3.2. The GBT pointings were selected to cover regions along the lines of possible positions on the
sky, leveraging the diﬀerent beam width of the various bands in each case.

We observed our target area on UT 2021 November 6. The Earth is at its closest position to the
vector connecting the Sun to the target point in early November. In addition to minimizing the beam
size required for the hypothesized signal to be detectable from Earth, this also minimizes the number
of pointings required to cover the entire line of possible probe locations.

Data were taken at 300s per scan using an ABABAB pattern. The ABABAB sequence consists
of three “nods” between our “ON” source target and an “OFF” target. The OFF target is used to
identify and correct for radio frequency interference (RFI). We chose HD 13908 as our OFF target
because it has the smallest on-sky separation from the ON target of any known planet-hosting star.
The separation between the ON and OFF targets is 317(cid:48), which is equivalent to 37 beam widths at
L-band and 58 at S-band. Additionally, a scan of a pulsar was completed at the beginning of each
night of observations to conﬁrm that the telescope and instrument were performing as expected.

3. ANALYSIS

3.1. TurboSETI

9

Figure 3. Observations of the possible probe positions for communication with α Cen on UT 2021 November
6. The blue and orange lines mark the positions for receiving and transmitting probes, respectively, with
light travel time taken into account. Tics along the probe position lines show where a probe at certain
distances from the Sun would lie. The FWHM beam positions of each observation are represented by black
circles, labelled by ﬁlter.

We used turboSETI (Enriquez & Price 2019) to analyze our observations by searching for signals
with speciﬁc drift rates. In the rest frame of the Sun, the proposed communication relay is eﬀectively
stationary, so a monochromatic transmission viewed from Earth should only show Doppler shifts due
to the orbital motion and the rotation of the Earth. To obtain a drift rate for a signal from the relay,
we used barycorrpy (Kanodia & Wright 2018) to calculate the radial acceleration between GBT and
the probe. Given this radial acceleration dvr/dt, we calculate a maximum drift rate ˙fmax in Hz/s:

˙fmax =

dvr
dt

fmax
c

,

(8)

where fmax is the maximum rest-frame frequency observed.

The magnitude of the drift rate depends on the frequency and relative acceleration at the time of
observation. The largest contribution to the relative acceleration term is due to the rotation of the
Earth. A signal from a probe at rest relative to the Sun should exhibit a negative drift rate to an
observer on Earth (Sheikh et al. 2019).

We calculate drift rates for the hypothetical probe relative to the barycentric frame at the time of
observation based on the pointing of each beam. These drift rates are around −0.124 to −0.127 Hz/s
in L-band, and −0.18 Hz/s in S-band. To account for uncertainty in the probe’s position within a
generous margin, we multiply the calculated drift rate for each pointing by a small numerical factor
(×1.3) and use these modiﬁed drift rates as the maximum drift rates in our search through the data.
Without specifying a minimum, we employ turboSETI to search for hits up to this maximum drift
rate.

Since the maximum drift rate of the hypothetical probe is quite small, it is computationally fea-
sible to conduct a high-sensitivity search. By default, turboSETI searches for signals above a SNR
threshold of 25. For our analysis, we lower this threshold to 10.

Following an initial search for signals, turboSETI performs an additional check on the preliminary
detections using three diﬀerent “ﬁlter thresholds” to remove RFI from the pool of candidates based
on the ON/OFF observing cadence. The ﬁrst ﬁlter threshold simply looks for signals above the
speciﬁed SNR. The second threshold looks for signals above the SNR that appear in at least one
on-pointing, but not in any oﬀ-pointings. And the third looks for signals that appear consistently in
all ON pointings and no OFF pointings.

It has been noted by the BL team (Enriquez et al. 2017) and others (Margot et al. 2021) that
turboSETI has two potential weaknesses. First, frequency binning causes a signiﬁcant drop in sensi-
tivity for drift rates above 0.16 Hz/s. Fortunately, for these observations the expected drift rates are
of the same order as the drift rate where this drop in sensitivity occurs. Thus, we do not expect this
issue to cause signiﬁcant sensitivity loss in this case. Second, it has been suggested that the ﬁltering
algorithm within turboSETI may be prone to missing signals that overlap with easily identiﬁable
RFI.

However, the narrow range of possible drift rates predicted by our theory allows for a much more
sensitive search (Wright 2020). We were able to inspect all of the signals within this range by eye
(3864 hits in L-band and 448 hits in S-band) to ensure that no signals of interest were discarded
along with RFI during ﬁltering.

3.2. L-band

The band pass ﬁlter used on GBT in L-band has sensitivity over the range of about 1.07 to 1.87
GHz, with a notch ﬁlter from 1.25 - 1.35 GHz. The RFI environment for L-band is notoriously
“noisy,” and the notch ﬁlter eliminates some of the powerful RFI that frequently dominates the band
1. The “hits” plotted in Figure 4 show the crowded RFI environment. Hits outside regions of detector
sensitivity, including the notch ﬁlter, have been included in greyed out regions to provide a more
complete picture of the data set and RFI environment.

The abundance of signals detected with multiple drift rates within narrow ranges of frequencies is
characteristic of RFI. We refer to signals with the same morphology spanning multiple frequencies
as combs. Although turboSETI is designed to not re-trigger on the same signal, it often triggers at
multiple drift rates on the same comb when that comb spans a large enough frequency range and its
morphology is suﬃciently complex. The addition of the light blue vertical lines in Figure 4 illustrates
the presence of these combs by highlighting hits closely grouped in frequency, separated by less than

above the SNR detected in any ON source pointing) of turboSETI in L-band. Each signal is sized
by the log of the SNR. The drift rates of each signal are determined by the turboSETI algorithm.
Hits passing only the ﬁrst ﬁlter threshold (any signal above the SNR detected in any ON source
pointing) are marked as blue dots. The purple triangles indicate hits passing the second ﬁlter
threshold (any signal above the SNR in at least one ON and no OFF source windows). The golden

OFFs). The orange dashed lines correspond to the barycentric drift rates, of -0.124, -0.125, and
-0.127 Hz/s, for each of the 3 ON source pointings. The faint blue vertical stripes correspond

0.1% of the maximum frequency in the given ﬁlter. The orange dashed lines show the expected drift
rates for the ON source pointings as discussed in Section 3.1.

From the entire L-band data set, turboSETI identiﬁed 27995 hits passing the ﬁrst ﬁlter threshold,
23306 of which were within the frequency ranges the band pass ﬁlter is sensitive to, as described
above and shown in the white regions of ﬁgures 4 & 5. 9929 hits passed the second ﬁlter threshold,
9585 of which were within the frequency ranges the band pass ﬁlter is sensitive to, and only 3 signals
made it through the third ﬁlter threshold, all within the sensitivity range.

Figure 5 isolates all the hits within the barycentric drift rate window shown in Figure 4. Only the
drift rates for the ON source targets are relevant, so we considered only those drift rates calculated
by turboSETI near the expected values. The marker types indicate the highest ﬁlter threshold that
each hit passed. Out of the 3 hits passing the third ﬁlter threshold, only 1 was within the drift rate
range we were searching for.

Figure 6 shows the output plot of the dynamical spectrum for this best candidate and more generally
illustrates the ON/OFF observing cadence. Figure 7 zooms out to show this signal over a wider
frequency range, which clearly identiﬁes both what turboSETI likely erroneously triggered on, and

Figure 5. All of the signals above a SNR of 10 detected using the turboSETI algorithm around

these observations in L-band. This shows the SNR for all the hits around the dashed orange lines
shown in ﬁgure 4 within the detector sensitivity range. Hits passing only the ﬁrst ﬁlter threshold
(any signal above the SNR detected in any ON source pointing) are marked as blue dots. The
purple triangles indicate hits passing the second ﬁlter threshold (any signal above the SNR in at
least one ON and no OFF source windows). The lone golden star indicates the one hit within
this drift rate window that passed the third ﬁlter threshold (signal detection in all ONs and no
OFFs). Figure 6 shows the dynamic spectrum of this signal.

that the signal is part of a ∼80 kHz wide sweeping RFI signal. While we cannot be certain about
the signal’s origin, its frequency, brightness, and drift structure are consistent with what would be
expected from an IRIDIUM satellite downlinking in its L-band allocation (Maine et al. 1995).

To be thorough, we concatenated all of the hits in the data from the ON sources and manually
selected them by drift rate, over the range of -0.110 to -0.127 Hz/s. We plotted all 3864 of these
signals and examined them by eye to conﬁrm that turboSETI only ﬁltered out RFI, ﬁnding nothing
of interest.

Figure 6. The single L-band hit that passed turboSETI’s strictest ﬁltering threshold, intended
to select for narrowband signals that appear in every ON source pointing and none of the OFF
source pointings, in the target drift rate range near -0.124 Hz/s. Each rectangular block labeled
“ON L” and “OFF HD13908” stacked on top of each other shows the ON/OFF observation
cadence. This is plotted over a narrow frequency range of 602 Hz centered at the detected signal
frequency of 1626.076447 MHz. The red dashed line indicates turboSETI’s best-ﬁt drift rate for
this signal. The color mapping indicates power, normalized to the maximum power in each panel.
It is diﬃcult to determine what turboSETI picked up from this plot alone, but Figure 7 shows
that it is RFI with a bandwidth of ∼80 kHz. Many hits in turboSETI show similar features,
where a zoomed-out look clariﬁes that that the signal is drifting RFI.

it is easier to see what the algorithm likely picked up as a potential signal. This shows our most
promising result is simply an RFI signal.

The band pass ﬁlter used on GBT in S-band is sensitive over the range of 1.80 to 2.80 GHz,
with a notch ﬁlter from 2.30 to 2.36 GHz (Lebofsky et al. 2019). Figure 8 provides a look at the
RFI environment in the S-band observations with all of the hits passing the ﬁrst ﬁlter threshold of
turboSETI according to their drift rate and frequency. Similar to Figure 4, regions where the detector
has little to no sensitivity are greyed out. The RFI environment for S-band is not as crowded as
L-band, but turboSETI still detects multiple frequency combs, again highlighted in vertical bands.

Figure 8. All of the signals above a SNR of 10 detected at the ﬁrst ﬁlter threshold (any signal
above the SNR detected in any ON source pointing) of turboSETI in S-band. Each signal is sized
by the log of the SNR. The drift rates of each plotted point, corresponding to a signal above the
SNR, are determined by the turboSETI algorithm. Hits passing only the ﬁrst ﬁlter threshold (any
signal above the SNR detected in any ON source pointing) are marked as blue dots. The purple
triangles indicate hits passing the second ﬁlter threshold (any signal above the SNR in at least
one ON and no OFF source windows). The golden stars indicate the hits that passed the third
ﬁlter threshold (signal detection in all ONs and no OFFs). The orange dashed line corresponds
to the barycentric drift rate, of -0.18 Hz/s, for each of the 3 ON source pointings. The light
blue vertical strips correspond to signals within 2.8 MHz (0.1% of the maximum frequency in
this band) of each other, likely indicating they are part of a RFI comb. Data outside regions
of detector sensitivity as well as those falling within the notch ﬁlter (2.30-2.36 GHz) have been
greyed out.

Figure 9 isolates all the hits within the barycentric drift rate window shown in Figure 8. Only the
drift rates for the ON source targets are relevant, so we considered only those drift rates calculated
by turboSETI near the expected values. The marker types indicate the highest ﬁlter threshold that
each hit passed. Out of the 6 hits passing the third ﬁlter threshold, none were within the drift rate
range expected for an SGL probe.

From the entire S-band data set, turboSETI identiﬁed 24298 hits passing the ﬁrst ﬁlter threshold,
23563 of which were within the frequency ranges the band pass ﬁlter is sensitive to, as described
above and shown in the white regions of Figures 8 & 9. 2226 hits passed the second ﬁlter threshold,
2169 of which were within the frequency ranges the band pass ﬁlter is sensitive to, and only 6 signals
made it through the third ﬁlter threshold, all within the sensitivity range.

To be thorough, we concatenated all of the hits in the data from the ON sources and manually
selected them by drift rate, over the range of -0.16 to -0.18 Hz/s. We plotted all 448 of these signals
and examined them by eye to be sure no signals were being ﬁltered out with the RFI by turboSETI.
We found no signals of interest within the frequency ranges of this band pass.

hits within this drift rate window passed the third ﬁlter threshold (signal detection in all ONs

4. RESULTS & DISCUSSION

Our analysis reveals no signals near the expected drift rate for a stellar relay opposite α Cen in L
or S bands. Although turboSETI output 3 signals in L-band and 6 signals in S-band that passed all
of its ﬁlters, only 1 of these was found around the expected drift rate, and we determined that all
candidate signals are RFI. This was conﬁrmed by visually inspecting the waterfall plots produced by
turboSETI, paying particular attention to signals around the expected drift rate for each pointing
and examining the RFI environment for each band. Figure 6 shows the only one of these candidates
identiﬁed with a drift rate around what would be expected. Figure 7 shows this to be RFI.

To address concerns that a positive signal could be ﬁltered out with the noise, we examined all
of the signals detected around the barycentric drift rate for each band without applying turboSETI

ﬁlter thresholds. Although not practical for many radio SETI searches, our narrow range of drift
rates provided the opportunity to scrutinize the data more closely. The result of this search provided
additional conﬁdence that there were no true positives ﬁltered out by the turboSETI algorithm.

4.1. HD 13908

In addition to our SGL search, we used the OFF source pointings to observe a nearby star, HD
13908. We ran another analysis up to the default drift rate of 10 Hz/s on these observations in L-band
and S-band at a SNR of 10. As this was not our primary target of interest, we did not address the
limitations of turboSETI for this additional target. We report for completeness that no convincing
ETI signals were found in these bands using turboSETI during the HD 13908 observations.

In L-band, turboSETI detected 4932 hits passing the ﬁrst ﬁlter threshold, 1085 passing the second
ﬁlter threshold, and 7 hits passing the third ﬁlter threshold. None of the hits that passed the third
ﬁlter threshold were of interest.
In S-band, turboSETI detected 1733 hits passing the ﬁrst ﬁlter
threshold, 392 passing the second ﬁlter threshold, and no hits passing the third ﬁlter threshold.

4.2. Detection Sensitivity

Sensitivity for radio SETI observations is often measured with Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power
(EIRP) (Tarter 2001), which is a function of the observing instrument, the SNR threshold, the
observing time, and distance to the transmitter:

EIRP = 4πd2 × SNR × SEFD ×

(cid:114)

∆ν
2t

,

(9)

where d is the distance to the transmitter, SNR is the signal to noise ratio, ∆ν is the frequency
resolution of the detector (where here we assume the transmitter bandwidth is narrower than or equal
to the resolution of the detector), and t is the on-source integration time. The System Equivalent
Flux Density (SEFD) is speciﬁc to the observing instrument in a given band. The SEFD is reported
as 10 Jy for the L-band receiver and 12 Jy for S-band at GBT2. In both bands, the BL backend
achieves a frequency resolution ∆ν of 2.79 Hz. The integration time for each of our pointings was
300 seconds, and we analyzed the data with a minimum SNR of 10.

At the shortest theoretical distance of 550 AU, the minimum detectable powers of an isotropic
transmitter in L-band and S-band are EIRPL = 6.6 kW and EIRPS = 8.1 kW respectively. At the
1000 AU suggested by Hippke, EIRPL = 22 kW and EIRPS = 27 kW. However, we anticipate a
probe utilizing the SGL to be a directed transmitter. Assuming a conservative gain of 103 in L-band
and roughly 4 times that in S-band (see Section 1.2), a ∼1 meter transmitter would be detectable
by our search above 7 W at 550 AU or 23 W at 1000 AU in L-band, and above 2 W at 550 AU or
7 W at 1000 AU in S-band. These transmitter powers are comparable to cell phones, which emit at
0.6 or 3 W, as well as CB radios at 4 W. A micro-broadcasting FM transmitter puts out 7 W, and
Voyager I 23 W.

Using GBT to make observations aﬀords studies of this kind some of the most sensitive radio
reception in the world, allowing us to search for relatively low power transmitters. Conducting
searches for more powerful transmitters may feasibly be carried out by less sensitive facilities down
to the scale of amateur hobbyists.

4.3. Future Applications

Although α Cen belongs to our nearest neighboring star system, it may not be the best star to
study in the SGL network context. Kerby & Wright (2021) found that close binary star systems
are unsuitable for stellar gravitational lens relays due to the high delta-v cost required to maintain
alignment. Kerby & Wright instead suggest that the best candidate stars for hosting relay systems are
without close companions, without large gas giant planets, relatively low in mass, and not spinning
rapidly enough to deviate from sphericity. However, a signiﬁcant number of stars do not ﬁt this
criteria, and the diﬃculties may often be overcome with some extra delta-v or settling for lesser but
still signiﬁcant stellar lens gains. Hippke (2021) created a ﬁrst attempt at a prioritized list of targets
for these searches, based on factors including the lack of massive companions and the presence of
conﬁrmed planets.

Another consideration in selecting stellar relay probe search targets is whether our observations
would be made from within the probe’s beam, though we have shown that for relatively small
spacecraft in radio wavelengths this is not of much concern. Focusing on stars in Earth’s transit zone
(Heller & Pudritz 2016; Sheikh et al. 2020; Kaltenegger & Faherty 2021) would allow for observations
guaranteed to be in such a beam when Earth is eclipsed by the Sun from the star’s viewpoint, even
for large optical laser transmitters.

We observed the SGL position opposite α Cen over a single night. Such a limited search may miss
extant probes if they are not constantly transmitting. A thorough search for stellar relay probes in
the Solar System would involve the monitoring of the antipodes of many stars over longer periods of
time. Some progress on this may, in fact, be possible with serendipitous archival observations that
happen to include the antipodes of nearby stars (see Palumbo et al., in prep).

Our search was limited to the region of sky that would be occupied by probes at or past the Sun’s
focal point of 550 AU. However, Gillon et al. (2021) propose that searching for closer probes may still
be worthwhile. Gillon et al. propose that an array of 1 m lasers may be placed much nearer the Sun,
because even at 10 AU, the loss in gain is only a factor of 33. Such transmitters would be subject to
stronger perturbations due to planets, but they would also receive much more solar irradiation for
power.

As discussed in Section 1.3.1, wavelengths longer than 100 µm are subject to signal strength loss
due to the solar corona. Hippke (2020b) suggests that the optimal wavelength range for SGL signals
would be between 100 µm and 1 nm. We observed at relatively long radio wavelengths, 1-4 GHz or
30-7.5 cm. Here, losses due to the solar corona are not prohibitive, but are nevertheless signiﬁcant.
The diﬃculty with using turboSETI to analyze observations at shorter wavelengths is, as mentioned
in Section 3.1, that the 1-to-1 binning ratio is 0.16 Hz/s. The drift rate of a signal is a function of the
frequency of that signal, so higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) increase drift rate beyond the 0.16
Hz/s limit, which causes a signiﬁcant reduction in sensitivity (Margot et al. 2021). Sensitivity loss is a
trade-oﬀ that may be worthwhile for the opportunity to cover more parameter space, especially when
speciﬁc power levels are not well motivated. It is also possible to recover some of the lost sensitivity
for higher drift rates through “frequency scrunching,” wherein frequency bins are eﬀectively summed
together. The next generation dedoppler and hit search algorithm from the BL team is in production
with the intention to improve search sensitivity.

5. SUMMARY & CONCLUSION

19

In this work, we have have described the history and physics behind the proposed use of stars
as gravitational lenses to create an interstellar communication network, which motivates an artifact
SETI search for such probes in our own solar system. We presented our method for searching
for radio transmission from a probe in the solar system in communication with nearby stars and
demonstrated this method on α Cen. Our analysis found no signals near the expected drift rate
during our observations. Therefore, if such a probe exists, it is not transmitting constantly in the 1-3
GHz range. We also present statistics regarding the radio frequency interference environment in this
region of sky in the L and S bands. In the future, both archival data and new observations can use
similar methods to further search for relays that make use of the Sun’s lensing ability for interstellar
communication.
