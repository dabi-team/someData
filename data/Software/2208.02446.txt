ABSTRACT

In this technologically advanced era, with the proliferation of artiﬁcial intelligence, many mobile
apps are available for plant disease detection, diagnosis and treatment, each with a variety of features.
These apps need to be categorized and reviewed following a proper framework that ensures their
quality. This study aims to present an approach to evaluating plant disease detection mobile apps, this
includes providing ratings of distinct features of the apps and insights into the exploitation of artiﬁcial
intelligence used in plant disease detection. The applicability of these apps for pathogen or disease
detection, identiﬁcation, and treatment will be assessed along with signiﬁcant insights garnered. For
this purpose, plant disease detection apps were searched in three prominent app stores (the Google
Play store, Apple App store, and Microsoft store) using a set of keywords. A total of 606 apps were
found and from them 17 relevant apps were identiﬁed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The
selected apps were reviewed by three raters using our devised app rating scale. To validate the raters’
agreement on the ratings, inter-rater reliability is computed alongside their intra-rater reliability,
ensuring their rating consistency. Also, the internal consistency of our rating scale was evaluated
against all selected apps. User comments from the app stores are collected and analyzed to understand
their expectations and views. Following the rating procedure, most apps earned acceptable ratings in
software quality characteristics such as aesthetics, usability and performance, but gained poor ratings
in AI-based advanced functionality, which is the key aspect of this study. However, most of the
apps cannot be used as a complete solution to plant disease detection, diagnosis and treatment. Only
one app, Plantix - your crop doctor, could successfully identify plants from images, detect
diseases, maintain a rich plant database, and suggest potential treatment for the disease presented. It
also provides a community where plant lovers can communicate with each other to gain additional
beneﬁts. In general, all existing apps need to improve functionalities, user experience, and software
quality. Therefore, a set of design considerations has been proposed for future app improvements.

Introduction

Plant diseases are a naturally occurring phenomenon limiting plant growth, development and reproduction [1]. Plant
diseases and the pathogens causing them are a direct threat to the global economy and food security [2]. Plant diseases
are typically caused by pests, including viral, bacterial, and fungal-like organisms that hinder the normal growth of
plants and cause variations in their vital functions [3]. For example, Leaf Blast, Brown Spot, Leaf Blight, Sheath Rot,
and Stem Rot are common rice diseases which reduce grain quality and destroy the majority of rice seedlings when badly
infested [4]. Phytophthora infestans or Late Blight, and Alternaria solani or Early Blight, are two well-characterised
diseases that cause signiﬁcant yield losses in potatoes [5]. Stripe Rust, Powdery Mildew, Leaf Rust, and other diseases
harm winter wheat in central Asia, causing signiﬁcant grain yield losses [6, 7].

In contrast, severe grape leaf diseases like Black Rot and Powdery Mildew have a signiﬁcant impact on grape yield
and quality during the growth process, particularly in wet or moist humid conditions [8, 9, 10, 11]. Soybean exhibits
numerous leaf diseases such as Anthracnose, Bacterial Blight, Soybean Mosaic Virus, Copper Phytotoxicity, Charcoal
Rot, Leaf Cercospora, Rhizoctonia Aerial Blight, and Downy Mildew. Plant pathogens causing disease have become
a great menace when it comes to crops or other cultivated plat materials as our livelihood is dependent on them [12].
Therefore, identifying plant diseases is crucial for avoiding long-term or periodic harm to harvested produce, and living
landscape plants [13]. Early diagnosis of plant diseases allows for the implementation of preventive measures and the
reduction of economic and production damage [5]. For sustainable agriculture, plant health observation and predictive
maintenance are essential for reducing losses related to agricultural commodity yields and quality [14].

A traditional way of treating plant diseases is through the direct consultation of farmers and horticulturists with plant
pathologists or outreach specialists in person. Experts physically examine different parts of the symptomatic plant or test
the soil to evaluate soil properties, nutrients or pH and treatments are then suggested. However, the traditional method of
diagnosing plant diseases can be unreliable and limited by available expertise [15, 16]. Continuous plant surveillance by
land managers is not always practical or cost-effective [17]. For this reason, mobile and other technologies can provide
a low-cost, high-precision alternative [18]. There are various symptoms that can be used to identify plant pathogens and
related diseases [19]. Modern technology has been brought into the picture to enhance the diagnostic process. This
sector is modernized now with the advent of technology as smartphones have made their way into everyone’s lives,
including those of rural farmers. As a result, many applications related to plants and their pathogens/diseases have been
built on many platforms in recent years [20, 21, 22].

Existing plant and plant disease-related apps have a broad range of functionalities, such as identifying of plants and
diseases, disease severity estimation, biological knowledge, agricultural solutions, marketplace parameters, and more.
Plant identiﬁcation and disease detection are the most critical and beneﬁcial features of the apps as stakeholders take
the required steps based on the result of plant disease detection. To provide these functionalities, image processing
techniques, the grading method, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) techniques
have been applied, supported by a large image data-set of plant varieties and their diseases [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
30, 31, 32, 33].

Several apps claim to effectively recognize and treat plant diseases on various platforms, but unfortunately, there is
no accreditation of apps, which is why individuals may face difﬁculty selecting the best app. Also, veriﬁcation of the
functionality does not mean the app is user-friendly and effective, as there are many evaluation metrics, such as user
interface, error rates, response time, transparency, etc., other than user ratings. So, plant disease detection apps require a
thorough analysis using a proper methodology.

To the best of our knowledge, no such structured study has yet been conducted on plant disease detection, severity
estimation and treatment related mobile apps. A brief description of agricultural apps and plant disease apps has been
provided by researchers [34, 35, 36, 37], however, they did not focus on plant disease detection, diagnosis and care
related criteria. In contrast, this study aims to review plant disease detection applications from three different platforms
(the Google Play store, Apple App store and Microsoft store) by giving equal importance to the disease identiﬁcation
speciﬁc functionalities and software quality ensuring criteria. In this paper, we have made the following ﬁve major
contributions:

1. We have examined the existing apps accessible in the three major app stores (i.e., Google Play store, Apple

App store, and Microsoft store).

2. We have devised an app rating scale for analyzing plant disease detection apps by adopting and extending

existing rating scales.

3. We have evaluated the selected apps through our devised app rating scale and and identiﬁed their design issues.

4. We have analyzed app store user comments to better understand users’ expectations and perspectives.

5. We have provided design guidelines that emphasize using artiﬁcial intelligence for better plant disease detection

app development.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology and Section 3 presents our evaluation results.
Section 4 discusses the limitations of the reviewed apps and design considerations for better app development. Finally,
Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 Methodology

2.1 App search strategy

Apps were searched in the three most popular app stores: Google Play, Apple App and Microsoft. A keyword-based
search process has been employed following a similar approach used in previous studies [38, 39]. The keywords that
were used included: “plant disease", “leaf disease", “plant disease detection", and “leaf disease detection". To maintain
transparency and clarity in reporting, as well as the opportunity for other researchers to recreate the systematic search
procedure for apps, a structured strategy PRISMA was followed [40, 41]. The complete process of app searching,
screening, and selection is presented using the PRISMA diagram in Fig. 1. After removing the duplicate apps, multiple
screenings were performed to remove the redundancies and irrelevancies by mutual consensus of the researchers of this
paper. The selected apps were further assessed quality-wise to avoid any bias. This extensive search procedure was
executed twice to ensure no relevant apps are missed in the screening process.

Figure 1: PRISMA diagram of study

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were deﬁned to select relevant apps. In the screening process, an app was included
if it is related to plant disease detection and mentions this feature in the description or about section of the app in

the respective app store (inclusion criteria). The exclusion criteria were: (i) apps that are not relevant to plant or
plant disease detection; (ii) apps that are only information based or educational about plant diseases; (iii) apps under
the category of games since they do not have any relevance with the scope of our review; (iv) apps that provide a
marketplace for farming essentials such as fertilizers or pesticides, or provide expert farming consultancy or advice; and
(v) apps that are not in English as other languages are not comprehensible to us.

The investigators collaborated on the inquiry, screening, and retrieval phases of the app searching and collection
processes. Each kept a separate list of apps they discovered in app stores using the ﬁnalized procedure’s inclusion and
elimination parameters. The investigators used their personal devices to decide which apps are suitable for selection.
Some problems were faced during the accumulation of the individual app lists, for instance an app was excluded by
one investigator but added by another investigator. Disagreements among the investigators were settled by discussion
before consensus was achieved. The resulting app lists were combined to create the ﬁnal list of apps for review (n=606).
Multiple screenings were performed to reach a consensus among researchers to rule out apps that were irrelevant to the
review. After removing duplicate apps (n=12), title and description-based screening was performed, which identiﬁed
eligible apps (n=45) for the review, considering the exclusion criteria. Those 45 apps were installed and screened, and
in that process, 28 apps were excluded for various reasons. This screening process resulted in selecting 17 apps for our
review.

2.2 Raters

The selected apps were evaluated by three raters using our devised mobile app rating scale (see Section 2.3). The
raters reviewed all the apps independently in a Google form and then information was collected in a Google sheet and
processed later for assessing different parameters. The three expert raters include one software developer with over four
years of mobile app development experience in a reputed company and two computer science graduates with two years
of mobile apps development experience. In addition, the raters were under the guidance of a PhD graduate in software
engineering with ten years of mobile app research experience. He also acted as a fourth rater whenever there was any
discrepancy among the three raters and required to resolve the matter.

2.3 App rating scale for plant disease detection

A standardized approach was necessary to assess the mobile apps based on various aspects of the mobile application.
Moreover, such an approach allowed us to assess and compare apps objectively, considering their functionality and
different software quality criteria. The Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) for mobile health apps [42] is a popular
rating scale that provides a multidimensional measure of the app quality assessment. We adopted and extended the
existing app rating scales [39, 43, 44, 42, 45, 46] for devising our app rating scale for plant disease detection.

The set of sub-scales that were adopted and extended to our plant disease detection apps’ rating scale from the mentioned
tools was as follows: (i) app classiﬁcation; (ii) aesthetics; (iii) general features; (iv) performance and efﬁciency; (v)
usability; (vi) functionality (plant disease detection related); (vii) transparency; (viii) subjective quality; and (ix) the
app’s perceived impacts on users. Some of the sub-scales for rating were adjusted (e.g., app classiﬁcation) or newly
deﬁned (e.g., functionality) as needed to satisfy the objectives of plant disease detection apps. The rating scale was
constructed using the app quality standards clustered around the domains, excluding the metadata portion. Each question
was scored in a range of 1 to 5 using a Likert scale [47] or binary answer, depending on the type of question presented
to determine the criterion.

2.3.1 App metadata

Metadata provides basic information about the subject of interest. Table 1 lists the metadata such as platform, country
of origin, business model (free/paid), and the number of downloads for each of our evaluated apps. However, this
information has not been used in the app scoring process. For our selected plant disease detection apps, metadata
are extracted from the respective app stores. The iOS app store does not provide download numbers and thus 5 apps’
download numbers are missing in the table. We have found 5 apps with 10K+ downloads. All the 5 iOS apps were pay
to use, and the remaining 12 Android apps were free to download and use.

2.3.2 Aesthetics

The aesthetics of an app plays an important role in a good user experience. The attractiveness or look of an interactive
user interface is referred to as visual aesthetics, which is important for the functionality and usability of an app since it
affects users’ ﬁrst impressions. Users’ emotions and emotional reactions can be generated by the visual components of
technology products [48]. It is a critical component in the user interface’s effective usability, satisfaction, trust and
credibility, and preference [49, 50, 51, 52].

Existing plant disease detection apps have been developed for gardeners, students and producers. So, the buttons, icons,
or menus on the screen must be appropriate and zoomable. The resolution of graphics must also be good. Producers
from rural or urban areas use such apps, so the apps’ visual information and design must be appropriate for the target
audience. Thus, aesthetics was rated on these criteria for each app – layout, graphics, visual appeal, and appropriateness
for the target user group.

2.3.3 General features

Several general features are expected in a plant disease detection app, including data export option, login or sign-up,
notiﬁcation, multi-languages support, and on-board tutorial for a smooth user experience. Some of these features
are more objective than subjective. An app must provide basic functionality, like social sharing and data exporting.
These capabilities allow users to save information for later use and share it with others. Thus, the absence of these
characteristics was rated as a low point. A premium subscription option is also an important aspect of an app as
consumer spending on premium apps is expected to reach $270 billion by 2025, over 2.5 times what it was in 2020 [53].

A plant disease detection app must also provide an on-board tutorial so that a new gardener/user can understand clearly
how to use the app (e.g., taking picture, etc.). If the app provides customization features, it helps users to set their
preferred language and use it with more comfort. Notiﬁcations are designed to make it easier for users to remember new
features or messages and improve the app’s usage frequency. It can also alert users to take routine care of their plants or
crops. Thus, all these above-mentioned criteria were included in the general features sub-scale of our rating scale.

2.3.4 Performance and efﬁciency

A plant disease detection app requires a compatible device to function properly. For example, the device must have a
resonable camera to take high quality photos of plants or leaves and roots. The app should also offer a quick cure or
suggestions for users facing a problem with their plants. This sub-scale includes CPU performance, memory usage,
battery consumption, the extent of heating up of the device, smooth working UI components, whether the app crashes
while running, etc. Thus, these criteria were included in our rating scale’s the performance and efﬁciency sub-scale.

2.3.5 Usability

The term “usability" refers to the entire relationship between the user and the product [54]. It directly impacts how
users feel about an app and may help them become long-term users. Even if people run into issues, a solution should be
simple to discover. The usability attribute analyzes how simple a system interface is to use [55]. Usability testing is
critical in determining if an app is of sufﬁcient quality to attract the attention of its desired user groups [56]. We consider
ease of use, ease of navigation between components, and whether interactions between components are intuitive in the
usability sub-scale of our app rating scale.

2.3.6 Functionality

Functionality validates the goal of an app and its purpose. People search for apps in app stores using essential
functionality as a keyword, demonstrating how signiﬁcant this criterion is for an app [57]. The functionality assessment
criteria for plant disease detection apps included plant identiﬁcation, plant coverage, disease detection, infected area
visualization, disease severity estimation, treatment and expert/community support.

To deﬁne the rating scale of those assessment criteria, we emphasize technological advancement, such as the adoption
of artiﬁcial intelligence that provides automation. Manual techniques in conventional planting processes cannot cover
huge plantations or give critical early instructions in decision-making processes [58]. As a result, it is important to
create automated solutions that are practical, reliable, and cost-effective in monitoring plant health and delivering useful
information to decision-makers, such as disease detection, estimating its severity and recommending the correct dose of
pesticides in the treatment [59]. The functionality sub-scale criteria and the deﬁnitions of the rating scores to evaluate
those criteria are presented in Table 2. We discuss each of those assessment criteria below.

There is a strong demand for automated plant identiﬁcation that aids amateur users who lack specialized knowledge
in plant science in identifying plant species [60]. In recent years, we have witnessed ample research on artiﬁcial
intelligent-based automatic plant identiﬁcation from plant images [24, 61]. The leaf is an appropriate organ for this
identiﬁcation system as it has several distinct features, such as shape, vein, and texture [61, 62]. Thus, leaf identiﬁcation
is critical in plant classiﬁcation [63, 62]. [61] provided a thorough overview of image processing techniques for this
automatic plant identiﬁcation from the leaf along with some frequently used machine learning algorithms such as SVM,
KNN, RF, K-Means, and Hypersphere classiﬁers. For large-scale plant classiﬁcation, the deep learning method that
uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate discriminating features for plant classiﬁcation has become more
prominent recently [24, 64, 65, 66]. Hence, a rating of 5 has been given for the automation of plant identiﬁcation, which
means the app will identify the plant from the given picture. A rating of 3 has been assigned for the manual selection of
the plant as plant identiﬁcation is crucial for disease detection. Here, users will select a plant from the given list of
plants in the app, or they will have to mention the name of the plant. The lowest rating of 1 has been given to the lack of
plant identiﬁcation.

The range of different plants for pathogen diagnosis is also a critical aspect, as with the inclusion of various plants, apps
can cover a much broader range of diseases. The range of plants was established by examining the apps and appropriate
values were assigned on the rating scale. Thelarger the plant coverage, the higher its value on the rating scale and lowest
value has been given for zero plant coverage which means app does not cover any single plant.

Deep learning is a popular machine learning technique for detecting plant disease due to its automatic prediction
from large amounts of data with high accuracy. One such commonly used dataset is “PlantVillage" [67], which
contains 54K+ healthy and unhealthy leaf photos in 38 groups based on species and disease [68]. Using leaf images of
healthy and sick plants, customized deep learning models based on unique convolutional neural network architectures
have been constructed to diagnose of plant diseases [66]. Many conventional deep learning architectures are paired
with optimization and customization approaches to provide considerable accuracy using technology in plant disease
detection [69, 70, 66]. The performance of several deep learning techniques has been studied and compared [71].
Therefore, it is expected that mobile apps should implement them to automate disease detection. Thus, the highest value
of 5 has been assigned in the rating scale for automatic disease identiﬁcation from the plant image. A rating of 3 has
been assigned if any app identiﬁes the disease through a questionnaire, and a rating of 1 has been given for the inability
to detect disease.

After recognizing the plant disease, identifying the infected portion and its severity estimation are crucial tasks as they
will inform the user about the disease’s threat level. Severity estimation refers to the precise measurement of the leaf
area showing disease symptoms [72]. The unhealthy region of the plant leaves can be detected by the color space
conversion, then masking the green pixels (as they indicate the healthy areas of leaves) and ﬁnally applying a threshold

6

Evaluating Plant Disease Detection Mobile Apps

value to remove the green pixels so that the image contains only diseased areas [73]. A novel network, PD2SE-Net [74],
has been introduced to diagnose and estimate the severity of plant diseases. A U-Net architecture has also been utilized
to segment sick leaf areas [72]. So, if the result can be gained automatically from the image for both the visualization
and severity estimation of diseased areas, the highest value of 5 has been assigned on the rating scale. On the other
hand, if the user needs to point out the diseased portion of a leaf before the result is obtained, it has been rated with a
moderate value of 3. A value of 1 is assigned for the absence of these features.

Recognizing a critical issue is important, but solving the problem is even more important. The same may be said for
apps for identifying plant diseases. After the disease has been identiﬁed, the user must know what to do for the cure.
Apps can recommend a cure from their own solutions or link users to Google’s solutions. Because the information
provided by Google is recent, the highest rating of 5 has been assigned for it. A rating of 3 has been assigned for the
ﬁxed treatment information.

Even after all the solutions, getting aid from professionals or sharing any sort of problem with fellow users feels
fantastic. As a result, community support is a valuable resource, and users become more engaged to the app because of
their sharing. It also serves as a link between users and specialists. So, the highest rating of 5 has been assigned for any
sort of expert and community assistance, and a lower rating of 3 for solely community assistance.

2.3.7 Transparency

In any development, transparency refers to the open and honest sharing of a project’s status in real-time. The transparency
of mobile apps has been a signiﬁcant concern for consumers in recent times [75]. Nowadays, software developers are
dedicated to gaining and maintaining user trust, which is critical to the industry’s growth and development. However,
users are uninformed of how information is stored and disseminated because data transmission occurs in the background
of apps [76]. Also, trust is earned by providing explicit descriptions of what each app performs and acting in accordance
with those explanations. Consumers’ sharing of data between apps will be available to all users, regardless of the
app’s ability to work or not work. Consumers will choose when and how much they can share with other people. The
following factors were examined while evaluating the transparency requirements of the selected apps: (1) validity of the
information provided in the app store description; (2) authenticity of the publisher or developer and the app source; (3)
evidence-based app trial; (4) determining whether the app is feasible to achieve the developer’s stated goals; and (5) a
general alert to ask users’ permission before collecting personal or private data and location information [75].

2.3.8 Subjective quality

An app’s subjective quality is related to the user’s opinion, satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or overall view of the app. To
assess the subjective quality, the raters looked at how satisﬁed they are with an app, how likely they are to pay for
it, and how they would rate it overall. This sub-scale considers the user’s willingness to pay for the app, the user’s
recommendation for the app, and the user’s rating of the app.

2.3.9 Perceived impact of users

The use of an app can inﬂuence a person’s attitude toward relevant areas of their life. Considering plant disease
detection apps can inﬂuence a user’s knowledge of plant diseases, a well-informed app can make a person’s gardening
life easier and improve a user’s knowledge about relevant areas. Furthermore, such apps can inﬂuence people to garden
or gain a better understanding of plant care issues. Therefore, the criteria to evaluate an app’s perceived impact on its
users are deﬁned as: (1) improve awareness of the necessity of addressing plant diseases; (2) increase knowledge or
understanding of plant diseases; (3) change people’s minds about how to improve plantation and care; (4) improve
intentions or motivation to address gardening; (5) stimulate additional plant management help seeking; and (6) increase
plant disease treatment.

3 Results

3.1

Internal consistency of our app rating scale

Internal consistency describes the extent to which all the items in a test measure the same concept or construct (in
our case the questions/items used in a sub-scale/assessment criteria), such that the items are consistent with one
another and measuring the same thing [77]. We used Cronbach’s alpha, the most popular means of calculating internal
consistency [78]. Cronbach’s alpha (α) reliability coefﬁcient indicates internal consistency that ranges between 0 and 1,
with α ≥ 0.9 excellent, 0.8 ≤ α < 0.9 good, 0.7 ≤ α < 0.8 acceptable, 0.6 ≤ α < 0.7 questionable, 0.5 ≤ α < 0.6
poor, and α < 0.5 unacceptable [79]. The closer the value to 1, the higher the internal consistency.

7

Evaluating Plant Disease Detection Mobile Apps

For determining internal consistency, we placed all the apps we rated using our proposed rating scale. Table 3 reports
the internal consistency of the sub-scales of our devised rating scale – aesthetics, performance, usability, subjective
quality, transparency and perceived impact. We excluded two sub-scales – general and functionality, as their items are
not meant to be collective measures of the construct. The overall internal consistency of our modiﬁed scale was high at
alpha 0.97, which is excellent [79].

Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability

Inter-rater reliability is a way of quantifying the level of agreement between two or more raters who rate an item (in this
case, an app) independently based on a set of criteria [80]. We used the intra-class correlation (ICC) method to assess
inter-rater reliability. ICC is one of the most widely used statistics for evaluating inter-rater reliability if a study includes
two or more raters [81]. In our study, all apps were rated by the same three raters. Thus, we used the ICC two-way
mixed model as it is recommended when the raters are ﬁxed and each of the apps is rated by all raters [82]. Depending
on the 95% conﬁdence interim of the ICC estimation, values smaller than 0.5, within 0.5 and 0.75, within 0.75 and 0.9,
and higher than 0.90 suggest poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively [82]. The ICC score of our 17
apps was calculated as 0.869 (95% CI ranging from 0.847 to 0.888), showing a good level of inter-rater reliability.

Intra-rater reliability is estimated to measure how consistent an individual is at measuring a set of criteria. This is
a reliability estimation in which the same evaluation is performed by the same rater on more than one occasion. To
measure the intra-rater reliability of the three raters, the three raters reviewed all 17 apps twice in a two-months interval.
All three raters showed a signiﬁcant good level of intra-rater reliability between their two ratings; their two-way mixed
ICC values were 0.921 (95% CI 0.851 – 0.958), 0.985 (95% CI 0.972 – 0.992), and 0.869 (95% CI 0.847 – 0.888),
respectively.

3.3 Overall assessment of evaluated apps

The assessment scores for all 17 selected apps are reported in Table 4, with sub-scale ratings and their mean, standard
deviation. The mean of the scores of all criteria in a sub-scale is used to calculate the rating of that sub-scale. The
overall mean and standard deviation of an app’s scores in all sub-scales were used to evaluate its overall quality.

In aesthetics, 41.18% (7/17) of the apps are rated above 4 out of 5. Among them three apps, Cropalyser, Plantix -
your crop doctor, and Leaf Doctor, receive the highest score, i.e., 5 out of 5. Only one app, Plant Diseases
and Pests, receives the lowest score of 1.

In general characteristics, all the apps except Plantix - your crop doctor, received a score below 4. In terms of
login or sign-up, 82.36% (14/17) of the apps do not require users to login or sign-up to use - this allows the rural farmers
and gardeners to easily beneﬁt from the app. However, only three apps (17.67%) send users notiﬁcations about their
regular tasks. Most of the apps 94.11% (16/17) do not have a premium subscription. The user cannot export their data
in 70.59% (12/17) of the apps. 52.94% (9/17) of the apps do not present information visually through charts, graphs,
images or videos and do not have any tutorial or on-boarding facilities to help users operate the apps. Also, 64.71%
(11/80) of the apps do not have customization features. In this sub-scale, the app Plantix - your crop doctor
received the highest score of 4.13.

In the performance sub-scale, 14 out of 17 apps (82.36%) received a high score of between 4.33 and 5, which means
they are responsive, their components are working well, the apps do not crash, they consume low battery power and
have a reasonable memory. Among those 14 apps, Leafy and Plantix - your crop doctor, scored 5 out of 5,
which indicates that these apps show excellent performance while being used.

In the usability sub-scale, 82.36% (14/17) of the apps were very easy to use and scored 4 to 5, 70.59% (12/17) had high
navigational accuracy, and 58.82% (10/17) depict a high quality of gestural design. Overall, only a few apps 29.41%
(5/17) scored high (between 4 and 5) in this sub-scale. The lowest rated app in this sub-scale is Plant Diseases and
Pests, which scored 1.50. Only the app Pestoz - Identify Plant diseases scored 5 out of 5 in usability.

The functionality sub-scale is the most signiﬁcant sub-scale as it evaluates the features an app provides for disease
identiﬁcation and management. In our review, only 6 out 17 apps (35.29%) scored between 3 and 3.57 and the rest
scored below 3. The results indicate that apps with proper automation of identifying plants and diseases along with
disease severity estimation are mostly missing in the current apps.

The transparency sub-scale is assessed based on an app’s description in the app store, credibility through a legitimate
source, veriﬁed by evidence, goals and policy in accessing and sharing user data. In this sub-scale, only 3 out of 17 apps
(17.65%) scored above 4. Among them, Plantix - your crop doctor scored 5 out of 5. Two apps, Cropalyser
and Leaf Doctor, each scored 4.40.

The subjective quality sub-scale is measured based on an individual’s willingness to use, recommend people and pay
for the apps, and the overall star rating given by raters. In this sub-scale, 3 out of 17 apps (17.65%) scored 4 and higher.
Among them, Plantix - your crop doctor scored the highest value of 5. PlantDoctor scored the lowest value of
1.

The perceived impact on user sub-scale measures the effectiveness of an app in changing the attitudes of the farmers
and plant lovers who use the app. This was evaluated based on whether the app provides a community or forum to
share info and seek help. Eight out of 17 apps (47.05%) help enormously to increase awareness of the importance of
addressing plant diseases and behavior change toward crop illness treatment, 58.82% (10/17) are likely to increase
knowledge or understanding of infected plants; 29.41% (5/17) do not have concern about these observations. Two out
of 17 apps (11.76%) (AgroAI - Plant Diseases Diagnosis and Plantix - your crop doctor) rated 4.15 and
5, respectively. They can change attitudes toward improving plantations and care. The app, Plantix - your crop
doctor, provides strong motivation for users in their gardening and farming. On the other hand, 23.53% (4/17) of the
apps scored 1 in this sub-scale.

From the overall screening of the mean values of the evaluated apps, Plantix - your crop doctor, scored the
highest (4.56), but the functionality score for this app was 3.29. Most of the apps (10/17) got mean values ranging from
3 to 4, indicating that the quality of the apps is not up to the mark and they are speciﬁcally lagging in functionality.

Fig. 2 shows the average sub-scale speciﬁc scores and the total mean score of all 17 apps. The overall performance and
usability of the evaluated apps are very good (scored above 4.5), which means they are easy to use and fast to open.
However, the overall aesthetics value is average because few apps are outstanding and eye-catchy to look at, and most
are not so attractive. Our focus is the functionality sub-scale, which scored below 2.5. This value indicates that we have
not found any quality apps that can do all the desired tasks regarding plant disease identiﬁcation.

3.4 Assessment of app functionality

Plant disease identiﬁcation apps should contain some major criteria for fulﬁlling their sole intention. These apps are
meant to help farmers and gardeners by providing solutions regarding their plants. However, the reality is different
because the apps lack the functionalities to provide necessary to help the target users. We have already discussed
seven critical characteristics for plant disease detection apps in Section 2.3.6. They are (1) plant identiﬁcation; (2)
plant coverage; (3) disease detection; (4) visualize infected area; (5) disease severity estimation; (6) treatment; and (7)
expert/community support. The outcomes of our functionality analysis of 17 evaluated applications based on the seven
assessment criteria are shown in Fig. 3.

Evaluating Plant Disease Detection Mobile Apps

First, identifying the plants is a preliminary criterion for plant disease detection apps. Among the 17 reviewed apps,
47.06% (8/17) can automatically identify plants from the given image and 41.18% (7/17) kept the option of choosing the
plants manually before diagnosing any disease. Only two apps, Leaf Doctor and Riceye, do not fulﬁll this criteria as
Leaf Doctor focuses only on disease severity and visualizing the infected area of the leaf, where Riceye is dedicated
for rice crops only. Different apps have adopted different technologies to identify plants. For example, the PlantifyDr
app uses ML algorithms to identify a plant and detect whether a speciﬁc plant has a disease or not. Plant identiﬁcation
by PlantifyDr is shown in the Fig. 4. Another key criterion in our study was to identify the plant coverage, i.e., the
number of plants covered by the disease detection apps. The only app that missed this criterion is Leaf Doctor. Most
of the apps, nearly 53% (9/17), can identify diseases of more than 10 plants.

Figure 4: Plant identiﬁcation by PlantifyDr.

Our most signiﬁcant functionality is disease detection where it is expected that an app would automatically recognize the
disease from the photos of affected plants or leaves. Fortunately, 82% (14/17) of the apps have fulﬁlled that expectation.
Only one app, Cropalyser, identiﬁes diseases based on answers given by the user from a series of questionnaires.
On the other hand, the Leaf Doctor and Plant Doctor apps do not provide this functionality. Our reviewed apps
use a variety of techniques to detect diseases. For instance, Plants Disease Identification app uses ML Apple
technology to classify the plant diseases productively. The apps Cassava Plant Disease Identify and Garden
Plant Diseases Detector use computer vision techniques to classify the disease and monitor severity. To get the
maximum accuracy in disease detection, a large image database containing thousands of images has been used for
developing a model using artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN). The app Cassava Plant Disease Identify allows
user to report photos that are not properly captured. As more photographs are uploaded, the accuracy of the database
improves. User can notify the developer of the app by email, if a photograph is not recognized. The app is improving
its accuracy over time by using ML. The app Pestoz- Identify Plant diseases also applies advanced computer
vision techniques to identify the diseases. Fig. 5 shows screenshots of the disease detection UI of the Plantix and
AgroAI apps.

(b) AgroAI - Plant Diseases Diagnosis (Early Access)

Figure 5: Disease detection.

Another important criterion is disease severity estimation which is provided by only four apps, AgroAI - Plant
Diseases Diagnosis (Early Access), Leaf Doctor, Riceye, and Cassava Plant Disease Identify. Visu-
alization is also a useful measure to assess the severity of disease and identify the infected area of a plant leaf.

Only Leaf Doctor provides this functionality. This app helps users differentiate between damaged and healthy leaf
tissues and calculates disease severity as a percentage, as shown in Fig. 6. However, the app requires user knowledge
and input. The user needs to select up to 8 distinct colors that indicate healthy tissues on the app’s touch panel and
subsequently moves a threshold slider until only symptomatic tissues are changed into a bluish shade. Afterwards, the
app calculates the diseased percentage using that pixelated photo. The precision, accuracy, and stability of the Leaf
Doctor app have been tested using six diseases and typical lesions of increasing severity [83].

Providing treatment and care suggestions for plants is an essential functionality to motivate farmers and gardeners to use
plant disease detection apps. Two apps, Leafy and PlantifyDr, detect the plant disease and subsequently take users
directly to Google to get the latest information about the treatment (see Fig. 7a for UI screenshots of PlantifyDr).
Nine apps provide treatment information from their own database. Only the app Agrio provides treatment through a
community (see Fig. 7b).

Local farmers can contact with ﬁeld investigators through Agrio app to receive beneﬁts. This app uses drones for
remote ﬁeld investigation. Users of Agrio app can look at remote sensing insights, alerts, and data gathered during
the inspection process. They have a community where farmers can share their problems and intelligent sources
quickly provide necessary solutions or treatments. Within the groups, discussions about the necessary interventions
are becoming simpler. This app also uses AI which makes precise hyper-local weather forecasts easily available to all
growers. Growing degree days (GDD) is a measure used to calculate the amount of heat required for the development
of organisms (such as insects) in each stage of their growth. Monitoring GDD helps eliminate the guesswork in
determining the time required for control measures. One of the exciting possibilities is the alignment of treatment
schedules in different farms and gardens. Area-wide integrated pest management is the paradigm in which pest control
decisions and timing are coordinated across many ﬁelds.

Agrio’s daily brieﬁng informs growers of the required scouting operations and interventions in their ﬁelds and also
uses big-data to optimize predictions and offer phenology models speciﬁc to the different locations. They coordinate
area-wide integrated pest management operations and present users with the optimal treatment on time using AI.
Growers can use image identiﬁcation capabilities if help is needed with the trap analysis.

One extraordinary feature to connect the user with fellow gardeners, farmers and experts is the creation of a community.
Only two apps provide this feature, Plantix - your crop doctor and Agrio. Fig. 8 shows the community support
UI screenshots of these two apps.

(a) Plantix - your crop doctor

(b) Agrio

Figure 8: Expert/community support.

The Plantix - your crop doctor community is the world’s largest online community of farmers and agricultural
specialists where users can take advantage of agricultural professionals’ knowledge and share their crop related
problems to get solutions. The Agrio app provides a community with experts who respond to the users’ problems
more individually and provide treatment based on the issue, as discussed above. In conclusion, this expert/community
support feature should be included in all the apps for better user connectivity.

Our overall assessment of the functionality criteria for the apps is illustrated in Table 5. Here, we can see that 88.23%
of the apps can identify plants and detect diseases. In these sectors, apps from both app stores showed almost equal

14

Community supportAutomatic plant identification and disease detectionExpert suggestionsEvaluating Plant Disease Detection Mobile Apps

contributions. The most important criterion for our apps was disease detection but two of the apps Leaf Doctor and
PlantDoctor did not provide this functionality. About 94% of the apps cover more than 10 plants, and, in this case,
Android apps have a richer plant disease database than iOS apps. Sixty four percent of the apps provide treatment after
diagnosing plant disease. Most of our reviewed apps lack three functionalities - disease severity estimation, visualizing
the infected area, and expert/community support. Of all the apps, 23.52% can estimate the severity of the disease from a
leaf, 11.76% have expert/community support, and only one app can visualize the infected area from an infected leaf.

Among the 17 reviewed apps, Agrio, AgroAI - Plant Diseases Diagnosis, Cassava Plant Disease Identify
and Plantix - your crop doctor, contain a total of ﬁve out of seven functionalities. Seven apps, Pestoz
Identify Plant diseases, Cropalyser, PDDApp: plant disease detection , Leafy, Plant Disease
Detector,PlantifyDr, and Plant Diseases and Pests, contain four functionalities. The remaining six apps
contained less than half the functionalities outlined. In our study, no app was found to have all seven functionalities for
the best plant disease detection and management.

3.5 Analysis of app ratings from the app store and the developed rating scale

The app stores’ ratings and our rating scale’s ratings of the evaluated apps were analyzed. Reviews and ratings help users
decide whether to download an app. According to a study [84], mobile consumers do not even bother downloading an
app with a rating of fewer than three stars. Additionally, 79% of users will check at least one review before downloading
the application. Good ratings indicate that the app provides an advantage to its users. Developers can do everything
to improve the app’s rating and make it more successful in the future. During this survey period, AgroAI - Plant
Diseases Diagnosis (Early Access), Leafy, Plant Disease Detector, Riceye, Cassava Plant Disease
Identify, Garden Plants Diseases Detector, Plant Diseases and Pests and Agrio apps dis not have any
star ratings. Thus, these seven apps were excluded from this analysis. Fig. 9 shows the app store rating and our measured
app rating of ten apps.

Three apps (PlatifyDr, Cropalyser, and Plant Disease Identifier) got a higher star rating from app store users,
but some limitations were found in our analysis, they did not perform well in our devised rating scale. Consequently,
these apps achieved a lower rating from our raters. The measured score and app store ratings are almost the same
for four apps (Agrio, Pestoz Identify Plant diseases, PlantDoctor, and Plantix - your crop doctor),
which shows that our raters agree with the users’ ratings found from the app stores. Finally, three apps (Leaf Doctor,
Plants Disease Identification, and PDDApp: plant disease detection) received a slightly higher score
compared to the app stores’ ratings.

3.6 Analysis of user reviews from the app stores

Text reviews are more reliable than star ratings in describing users’ actual experiences. After using a mobile app,
users can add comments in the user reviews about that app. The user review section of an app store represents the
experience of using the app. Users’ feedback helps potential new users and developers to understand an app’s quality.
The developer beneﬁts from the evaluation because it focuses on the app’s limitations and technical ﬂaws, allowing
them to create a better version of the app.

In this research, to understand the overall user experience of those apps, two word-clouds have been created, as shown
in Fig. 10. Word-clouds are graphical representations of word frequency. The larger the word in the graphic, the more
frequently that word appear in the text [85].

User comments from the app listing from the respective app stores along with the app metadata were collected for
this study. Based on the users’ review ratings of the app, the consumer comment sections were split into two kinds

- the comment is positive if its rating is 4 stars or above, otherwise it is considered negative. The study of user
feedback from both app stores on plant disease detection apps reveals that most apps have little or no strong feedback or
favorable ratings from smartphone users because the count of apps installed was generally poor for most of the relevant
applications. Moreover, Apple App store does not show the number of downloads of an app.

However, 35.30% (6/17) of the apps contain informative comments and have 10K+ to 10M+ installations. A word-cloud
is generated in Fig. 10a using the positive comments collected from the selected apps. One of the most optimistic
collections of user comments has been noticed for Plantix-your crop doctor. This app has already received 60K+
comments, with 65% being 5-star reviews. Among the 35K+ highest star rating comments, people mentioned the
good points of this app. Users have used several words to express their satisfaction, such as “helpful", “wonderful",
“amazing", “fantastic", “awesome", “very good", “great", “best", “excellent", “useful", “easy to use", “accurate", “nice"
and many more. Many users gave “thanks" and praised the expert team of this app community. According to some
users, the ﬁnest plant disease diagnosis app is Plantix - your crop doctor. The app has several wonderful
features such as detection ability for crop diseases, a fertilizer calculator, and pest and disease-related information with

16

Evaluating Plant Disease Detection Mobile Apps

high-resolution pictures. The app provides a community support where plant lovers can share plant-related problems
and get suggestions from other users and experts. One user has commented “Hello team plantix You people are doing
wonderful job... I personally loved this app this app gives complete guidance for farming a variety of crops. Gives
details not only about disease but also about its treatment also provide guidance about fertilization of crop. It would be
great if more people install and give it a shot you wont regret of installing it . Best luck team plantix and thanks a lot.".
This comment is supported by many users. Another app, Agrio, has received the second-highest number of positive
reviews from users.

A word-cloud is generated in Fig. 10b using the negative comments collected from the selected apps. Some users
provided their damaged or diseased leaves images to the app, but could not detect the disease, or sometimes even the
plants, prompting some comments to include the word “unable". The word “stuck” is used to indicate that an app had
been trying to load a certain step or was being so sluggish that it seemed to have halted its task. Some apps have a
lengthy lag, most often unable to load an image from their servers, so they can take a considerable time to load affected
crop images. People use the words “unfortunately" and “worst" to express their dissatisfaction in these situations. Some
apps’ databases are limited and require more data. Sometimes apps show an unexpected error message. Other problems
include app “crashes” where the site does not function correctly. That is why users use the word “useless” many times.

Users’ dissatisfaction related to the Plant Disease Detection and PlantifyDr apps was focused on several points,
including limited crop and plant availability, an inability to detect plants, failure to login, the system displaying unknown
errors, incorrect weather reports, and failure to capture any pictures with a high-resolution camera. A user posted a
comment that was supported by 1k+ other users. He wrote: “Useless app for me. The app asks you to pick the top 4
crops you are interested in and it is really frustrating that you are forced to select from a VERY limited collection of
crops that don’t include the ones I want, like kale, spinach, garlic, broccoli, beets."

The Leaf Doctor app can not always determine the correct threshold of the given leaf. It indicates inaccurate thresholds
in most situations. Riceye provides garbage threshold every time. When a picture is imported into the PlantDoctor
app, it always responds that the image is unclear, despite the fact even if the image is in HD quality. The Pestoz app
has poor service and needs major upgrades. It has a limited database of diseased plant images. Sometimes it shows
an unexpected error message. It “crashes" and the site does not function correctly. Plantix - your crop doctor
covers 45+ crops and 600+ diseases related to them, does not support all ornamental plants and also has a community to
share queries with experts. The Agrio app is sometimes stuck on the home interface. Consumers used the “worst"
word several times to describe these incidents. Users put their damaged crops to the “Agrio community" but no help or
suggestion was found from the team. The Cropalyser app takes a considerable time to load crop images and is most
often unable to load an image from its servers. PDDApp: Plant Disease Detection shows a “Check Connection"
message every time through email, even with a strong internet connection, it can not run a single job. Plant Disease
Detector is a ﬂawed app that can not detect plants or leaves as it shows two random thresholds of any thing.

In summary, most of the currently available apps suffer from serious system design ﬂaws and development issues and
need improvement.

4 Discussions

4.1 Principal ﬁndings

We found many apps in the app stores when we searched by the keywords “plant disease", “leaf disease detection", etc.,
but only a few of them were well designed and developed to successfully detect plant diseases. Unfortunately, those few
apps of key interest also lacked the seven basic functionalities related to plant disease detection. Both plant identiﬁcation
and disease detection are present in 88.23% (15/17) of the apps. While selecting a plant from a pre-speciﬁed category,
sometime apps cannot identify it correctly. Plant disease detection is the central feature of all these apps, yet Leaf
Doctor and PlantDoctor, do not provide this feature. PlantDoctor gives the option of taking pictures through the
device camera and every time it shows the message “The image is not clear to be identiﬁed” even for a high quality
image. Another app, Plant Disease Detector, gives a verdict for both diseased and healthy plants by saying only
“Diseased”. Severity assessment helps the farmers to decide whether their plant needs treatment and to what extent.
This feature is present in only 23.52% (4/17) of the apps, where two of them (Plant Disease Detector and Riceye)
display a random threshold value.

We have noticed that some apps’ designs are troublesome. First, 35% (6/17) of the apps need an uninterrupted internet
connection to provide the complete service, which is difﬁcult to manage for village farmers or users living in remote
areas where the internet service is often poor. Second, a handful of apps cannot upload pictures from the phone photo
gallery, causing problems for users with low quality device cameras or who may not have the proper illumination to

17

Evaluating Plant Disease Detection Mobile Apps

take clear pictures while using the app. Third, most of the apps we reviewed were not multilingual, and thus, users of
these apps must have a basic knowledge of English.

We have found several beneﬁcial features in some of the reviewed apps. Plantix - your crop doctor is the best
for plant disease identiﬁcation. This app detects pests and diseases on crops and recommends the necessary treatment,
gives disease alerts, and contains a fertilizer calculator for crops based on the farmer’s plot measurements. It also gives
a weather forecast to let gardeners know the best time to weed, spray and harvest along with cultivation tips. Users
can interact with researchers, farmers, and plant professionals in an online forum to share plant health issues. They
have more than 30 million images in their data set, which contains more than 400 crop diseases. This app applies ML
algorithms and AI to photos to diagnose crops. It also allows for real-time disease and pest monitoring. The user’s
images are submitted to the servers and are immediately examined to identify the disorder. The user is given essential
information about the symptoms, triggers, agrochemicals, and biological remedies. The app includes a meteorological
information system customized to farmers’ locations, and a community option that allows them to communicate with
other plant protection groups and thus, increases productivity [86].

Another app, Leaf doctor, is slightly advanced in that users can select healthy tissues using up to eight colors in the
photograph and then be provided with the disease severity estimation. Also, users can ﬁx the threshold by using a slider
provided in the app. A signiﬁcant ﬂaw is that this app gives the severity estimation for any type of object which is not
necessarily related to plants or leaves. A unique feature provided by the app AgroAI - Plant Diseases Diagnosis
(Early Access) is the soil fertility test, where landowners can input the pH value of soil and see the proportion of
different soil elements such as calcium, potassium, clay, silt, etc. but this feature needs more development. Another app
with only the plant disease identiﬁcation feature is Leafy, which works ofﬂine and identiﬁes the correct plant and its
disease, though it has a limited diseases list (only 30).

Providing treatment or prevention alongside disease detection is a helpful feature provided by 64.71% (11/17) of
the apps. Also, many apps shared disease information with accompanying disease images, which is another useful
feature for information gathering related to plant diseases. Community help is provided by two apps Plantix - your
crop doctor and Agrio. In the Plantix - your crop doctor community, all gardeners, botanists and agricultural
experts can communicate and exchange suggestions - this is highly beneﬁcial. However, in the Agrio community,
plant disease detection is manually handled by their own expert team commenting in posts and suggesting treatments.
Moreover, any other people can also comment in the community forum. This is highly beneﬁcial for increasing farmers’
knowledge, improving their attitudes toward plant management, and increasing their help-seeking mentality. However,
the number of such apps is minimal. Most of the apps lack basic functionality and do not beneﬁt the users.

Automatic visualization of disease in an infected leaf helps to identify the diseased portion of a plant and this helpful
functionality is missing from all the apps. The existing apps need their basic features improvement where basic features
will be present andd to they will work more accurately.

4.2 Design considerations

There are many aspects of existing plant disease detection apps that require signiﬁcant technical improvements. A
simple yet attractive user interface with high-resolution graphics will attract users and increase their app exploring time.
Multilingual apps will encourage users from different countries to use the app and also give a better understanding
of the apps’ functionalities. Apps that provide tutorials at the beginning will help users operate the app easily and
correctly. Another simple but effective feature of an app that will keep users up to date on the status of their plants is
regular notiﬁcations. Any efﬁcient app will have low battery power consumption and low memory usage. Many of our
reviewed apps frequently crashed while in use. This issue should be considered while developing apps, as it has a large
negative impact on users. Also, the user interface components should work smoothly and be consistent.

From the functionality perspective, apps should perform all the operations accurately. Apps that cannot identify plants
can keep major categories of plants such as crops, vegetables, ornamental plants, medicinal plants, etc., covering many
different plant types so that users can easily ﬁnd their plants. The most important feature is plant disease detection,
which is the apps’ focus. Apps should detect the diseases accurately and, in the case of similar diseases, they should
be able to give the likelihood of each disease. Disease severity detection is another basic criterion to understand the
threat level of the disease that app should provide. To perform the disease severity estimation properly, visualizing the
infected area of the diseased portion is a prerequisite. Therefore, visualization has become a crucial task that should be
performed by the apps using existing image processing and ML technologies. Additionally, more information about the
disease and its control measures beneﬁts users, which encourages them to take further disease management steps from
the apps.

4.3 Limitations of this study

Several apps were unfortunately discarded due to regional restrictions, speciﬁc language restrictions, and the need to
have a license key to use the app. Furthermore, since our app search and evaluation, new apps may have been added,
and some of the apps might have been updated with enhanced functionality, or been removed from the app stores. In this
paper, we did not evaluate the accuracy of the disease detection performed by those reviewed apps but rather focused on
the software quality aspects, app features, and to what extent artiﬁcial intelligence is being adopted to provide advanced
disease detection functionality.

5 Conclusion and future work

This paper features a survey on plant disease detection apps from three popular app stores. Our search results identiﬁed
a total of 606 apps, from which we selected 17 based on a deﬁned set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. We further
evaluated those 17 apps using our devised app rating scale. Our app rating scale for plant disease detection evaluated the
AI-based functionality and software quality of apps. According to our ﬁndings, most of the apps fell signiﬁcantly below
standard. They tended to lack many basic and important functionalities to detect plant disease, and many of them give
users an inappropriate or incorrect verdict or solution. Although a few apps had some of the expected features, none
of those under review met all the required functionalities. We also observed that there were very few evidence-based
apps. As there have been numerous studies about plant disease detection and identiﬁcation, disease severity estimation,
localization and visualization, such technological advancements must be included in modern plant disease detection
apps. We hope that the developers mitigate the shortcomings found in existing apps so that the upcoming or updated
apps will contain suggested new functionalities and perform those features correctly. Producers and botanists will soon
be able to use these improved plant disease identiﬁcation apps in the ﬁeld. Users will be inspired to use these apps for
detection of any type of disease or plant pathogen, while others will be motivated to use these apps for further plant
management assistance.

In the future, we plan to address the identiﬁed limitations and study numerous apps from different app stores. Also, our
rating scale will be extended by incorporating the accuracy metrics related to plant disease detection. We will conduct
a formal sentiment analysis on user reviews in app stores. We will also improve the reviewer panel so that different
aspects of the apps, such as software quality and plant-speciﬁc functionalities, get appropriate attention and improved
evaluation.
