Abstract

We present a project to implement a national common strategy for the mitigation
of the steadily deteriorating Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) situation at the Italian
radio telescopes. The project involves the Medicina, Noto, and Sardinia dish antennas
and comprised the deﬁnition of a coordinated plan for site monitoring as well as the
implementation of state-of-the-art hardware and software tools for RFI mitigation.

Coordinated monitoring of frequency bands up to 40 GHz has been performed by
means of continuous observations and dedicated measurement campaigns with ﬁxed
stations and mobile laboratories. Measurements were executed on the frequency
bands allocated to the radio astronomy and space research service for shared or ex-
clusive use and on the wider ones employed by the current and under-development
receivers at the telescopes. Results of the monitoring campaigns provide a reference
scenario useful to evaluate the evolution of the interference situation at the telescopes
sites and a case series to test and improve the hardware and software tools we con-
ceived to counteract radio frequency interference.

We developed a multi-purpose digital backend for high spectral and time resolu-
tion observations over large bandwidths. Observational results demonstrate that the
spectrometer robustness and sensitivity enable the efﬁcient detection and analysis
of interfering signals in radio astronomical data. A prototype off-line software tool for
interference detection and ﬂagging has been also implemented. This package is capa-
ble to handle the huge amount of data delivered by the most modern instrumentation
on board of the Italian radio telecsopes, like dense focal plane arrays, and its modu-
larity easen the integration of new algorithms and the re-usability in different contexts
or telescopes.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: This document is primarily intended to provide an overview for
radio-astronomical purposes only. Every other use of the collected data and/or con-
siderations here reported is not in compliance with the authors wishes and therefore is
in no way permitted. Characteristics like band occupancies or the presence of signals,
even outside of the frequency bands allocated to the radio-astronomical service, have
been observed with the only purpose of optimizing the design of the receivers that will
be operating in that speciﬁc electromagnetic spectrum environment and/or the choice
of the most appropriate observational strategy.

1 Introduction

One of the most pressing problems for observational radio astronomy world-wide is the
ever-deteriorating situation of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). Dynamical spectrum
access is being increasingly exploited by transmitting devices, with new telecommunica-
tion technologies like mobile services and ultra-wide band devices more and more affect-
ing operations at most of the radio observatories. The variety of man-made radio sig-
nals propagating in the environment surrounding the telescope sites, translates more and
more frequently in RFI signals showing a complex behaviour in time and frequency that
can hardly be modeled and corrected. Such a situation might pollute the radio astronomy
receiver frequency bands and cause an irreparable data loss.

As sources of interference continue to proliferate, the requirements of astronomical
observations become increasingly demanding in terms of frequency range, bandwidth
and sensitivity, but also in the capability of RFI monitoring and mitigation. Nowadays, the
frequency bands assigned to passive science by art. 29 of the International Telecommuni-
cation Union (ITU) Radio Regulations, although still fundamental for radio astronomy, are
no longer sufﬁcient to perform cutting-edge science [1]. Wide-band receivers observe well
beyond the limits of the passive bands primarily assigned to the Radio Astronomy Service
(RAS), as also acknowledged by the national frequency allocation plan [2]. The increased
sensitivity of modern, cryogenically cooled receivers and the availability of large aperture
dishes imply that very low levels of RFI signal intercepted by the antenna beam pattern
are considered detrimental for radio astronomy data acquisition, as deﬁned in terms of
the system noise (ITU-Recommendation RA.769). Moreover differences between inter-
ferometers and single-dish instruments must be accounted for in the treatment of RFI.
While very-long-baseline interferometry beneﬁts from the intrinsic decorrelation of sig-
nals acquired in different environments [3], single-dish radio telescopes are particularly
vulnerable to RFI, as the astronomical and the disturbing signals are coherently added.

The avoidance strategy by itself can no more represent an adequate solution to the
RFI problem, which can be better addressed with a more structured approach. A variety
of methods should be implemented to address RFI mitigation, ranging from anticipatory
actions to the excision or cancellation of RFI signals in the post-detection stage (see [4]
for a review). Preventing/proactive measures like monitoring campaigns are necessary to
intervene on the local RFI environment on a regulatory level under local, national or re-
gional authorities. Moreover, a continuous monitoring of the RFI scenario at the telescope
sites is propedeutic to reactive measures, like the implementation of on-line and off-line
RFI cleaning in the data. The same technological advances that fuel the proliferation of
interference also produce technical solutions for RFI real-time, on-line excision. State-
of-the-art integrated circuits are widely used in the fabrication of fast and reconﬁgurable
backends for radio astronomy. They allow extremely high computation power, making it
possible to identify on-line the frequency channels bearing unwanted signals, and to sub-
sequently mitigate them by elaborating the signal even at the rate of the original sampling,
prior to operating any data averaging. As a result, the loss of data can be reduced to a
minimum. Complementary to on-line RFI mitigation, which poses strong requirements on
the processing capabilities of the acquisition chain, off-line techniques are applied in the
post-detection phase. Different strategies are adopted to identify and mitigate the many

5

different types of RFI, including statistical methods capable to pinpoint RFI characteristic
patterns in the time and frequency domains or threshold-based methods to detect more
irregular RFI. Recent advances in deep learning techniques allowed the development of
algorithms based on neural networks, that have been adopted both for single-dish and
interferometric radio astronomical data.

In this report we present a similar multi-faceted approach that the Italian National In-
stitute for Astrophysics (INAF) has started in the last years to deal with the increasing
incidence of RFI at the three Italian radio astronomical sites. The impact of RFI has
recently greatly intensiﬁed at the telescope sites not only due to its abundance and ap-
pearance at progressively higher frequencies, but also because of the increasing usage
of these antennas for single-dish wide-band observations. A coordinated approach for the
mitigation of RFI has started, comprising a national plan for the monitoring of the three
observing sites and the development of on-line and off-line RFI mitigation tools. Preven-
tive monitoring campaigns are being conducted to characterise the radio environment at
the sites through well deﬁned measurement procedures and the RFI spectral occupancy
within the frequency bands of the radio astronomy receivers. This is accomplished by
means of ﬁxed and mobile instrumentation through well deﬁned, common procedures.
Hybrid approaches accounting for the different telescope sensitivity, the instrumentation
used for RFI monitoring and the local orography pecularities have been experimented. In
recent years, ROACH-based digital backends exploiting the publicly available software by
the CASPER consortium have been installed at the Italian radio telescopes (e.g. [7]). The
experience gained in the use of such systems together with the acquired knowledge of the
RFI scenario at the sites is motivating the development of in-house ﬁrmware dedicated to
on-line RFI removal on board of digital spectropolarimeters. In parallel, the design of soft-
ware tools speciﬁcally tailored for off-line RFI removal in single-dish data from the Italian
radio telescopes is ongoing.

This report is structured as follows: in Section 2 an overall description of the project
undertaken at the Italian radio telescopes for RFI mitigation is provided. The activities
related to coordinated site monitoring, development of a digital spectrometer and of an
RFI ﬂagging tool are reported in Sections 3, 4.1, and 4.2 respectively. Our conclusions
are presented in Section 5.

2 The Project

The three Italian radio telescopes - Medicina, Noto and Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT) -
are located in the Po Valley, in Sicily, and in Sardinia regions respectively. Most of the Ital-
ian territory is densely populated, and the aforementioned sites are forcibly surrounded,
within a few tens of kilometers, by towns or cities. Medicina is the most exposed site; for
this reason, it is in a front position to anticipate the evolution of the RFI situation at the
other radio observatories in a near future. The orography of the SRT site is characterised
by the presence of mountain hills surrounding the antenna, while the landscape at Noto is
ﬂatter except for some hills in the north-eastern direction. On the contrary, the Medicina
telescopes are surrounded by a ﬂat landscape. This results in a similar RFI scenario at
the sardinian and sicilian sites. Such a complex scenario and the rapid evolution of the

6

man-made impact on the radio astronomical observations demanded for a coordinated
approach towards RFI mitigation in Italy.

The project undertaken at the Italian radio telescopes was initially funded within the
framework of the INAF Techno PRIN 2012 (project title ”RFI mitigation at the Italian radio
telescopes”, P.I. Dr. Karl-Heinz Mack) and aims at creating re-active RFI mitigation proce-
dures, which complement the various pro-active measures that must be put in place in a
coordinated manner at the telescope sites. To reach this goal, three main activities have
been identiﬁed. In the ﬁrst place, the knowledge of the local RFI environment is mandatory
to identify and characterize the most dangerous disturbers of scientiﬁc observations and
is propedeutic also to the implementation of further hardware/software mitigation strate-
gies. To this aim RFI coordinated surveys have been realized in the frequency range of
the receivers currently used for radio astronomical observations and in particular in the
narrower frequency bands allocated to RAS and Space Research (SR) acknowledged by
the ITU and the national authorities.

The second activity is focused on the acquisition of skills in the in-house development
of ﬁrmware for spectropolarimetric digital backends with high spectral and time resolution
capabilities over large bandwidths. Building on previous experience on FPGA-based sys-
tems and the availability of such hardware at the three telescopes, the ﬁrst prototype of
a multi-purpose digital spectrometer has been developed based on ROACH boards. As
the three Italian antennas share the same telescope operating system [9], the software
implementation of the current prototype and future ROACH-based backends is easily ex-
ported from one telescope to another. The common data formats delivered by the instru-
mentation on board of the Italian dishes allow for a coordinated approach also in off-line
RFI mitigation, which is the subject of the third activity. Current and future multi-feed re-
ceivers on board of the Italian dishes require the design and implementation of software
routines optimized to simultaneously handle multiple, big-sized data streams. This has
been accomplished by developing a software tool for data inspection and ﬂagging, specif-
ically tailored to handle spectropolarimetric single-dish data output by the Italian radio
telescopes.

In the next Sections a description of the results achieved in the three activities dis-

cussed above is reported.

3 RFI campaigns at the Italian Radio Observatories

The RFI scenario at the Italian radio telescopes is continuously evolving with peculiar-
ities typical of each local environment. The Medicina radio telescopes1, the 32-m dish
and the Northern Cross interferometer, are exposed to a wealth of artiﬁcial signals from
the surrounding Po Valley region. The 32-m Noto2 and the 64-m SRT [10, 11] radio
telescopes were built in South-Eastern Sicily and in Southern Sardinia respectively to de-
ﬁne the much long as possible baseline for the Italian radio interferometer experiments.
Moreover, the telescopes are located on different tectonic plates thus making possible to

perform geodynamical studies. Although these two sites were chosen after an accurate
RFI investigation and the areas around the telescopes still remain sparsely populated, the
RFI signals polluting the frequency bands of their receivers are steadily increasing.

Interfering signals can come from ﬁxed transmitters located in the telescope surround-
ings, but also from very distant geosynchronous satellites or the ones orbiting around the
Earth: all of them are seen by the telescope as sparsely distributed over time, frequency,
amplitude, polarization depending on the radio service type or on the accidental spurious
signal characteristic. Moreover, they typically are received from speciﬁc azimuth direc-
tions where inhabited areas, power lines, transmitting stations, satellites etc are located.
Even the accessory instrumentation and electronic devices in use at the observing site
have to be properly designed to avoid self-induced disturbing electromagnetic signals.
These would be detected by the telescope as invariant signals on the azimuth direction,
that must be monitored and mitigated as well.

RFI monitoring is conducted at the Italian radio telescope sites by measuring the pres-
ence of disturbing signals within the bandwidth of all the available receivers. In particular,
the sub-bands allocated to the RAS and SR are extensively monitored. The total fre-
quency range taken into consideration in the measurements activities presented here is
0.3 - 40 GHz. An upgrade of the telescope receiver suite up to 116 GHz is ongoing thanks
to a National Operational Program funding assigned to INAF in 2019 by the Italian Min-
istry of University and Research [22]. In the near future, an extensive RFI monitoring will
thus be needed to characterize the observing sites also at these higher frequencies.

The monitoring of the receiver frequency bands, especially those allocated to the RAS,
has been routinely performed at the Medicina site since the beginning of the 1980s. Such
activities have been carried out by means of a ﬁxed receiving station plus a mobile lab-
oratory [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], see Figure 1. This longstanding experience was then trans-
ferred to the staff at the other two Italian radio telescopes, which have been equipped
with instrumentation dedicated to the RFI monitoring as well (see Figure 1). At the SRT
a mobile laboratory has been operating since 2009 with state-of-the-art instrumentation
for RFI monitoring up to 40 GHz [17, 18], see Figure 1. In addition, recently a new RFI
ﬁxed station started operating at SRT by exploiting the telescope itself and, hence, its
high sensitivity as receiving antenna [19]. A new portable receiving system working in the
frequency range 0.3-18 GHz has been recently made available for RFI measurement at
the Noto site [20], as illustrated in Section 3.2.2.

The RFI groups at the three Italian radio astronomical sites work in strict collaboration,
sharing instrumentation and measurement strategies as well as performing combined
measurement campaigns to trace the evolution of the local RFI scenarios. At the same
time the speciﬁc peculiarities of each site and telescope, like the local orography or the
overall frequency coverage of the receivers, have motivated the development and use of
different and complementary monitoring techniques.
The information on the evolution of the RFI scenario (i.e. the characteristics of the signals
polluting the receivers frequency band and their angular direction w.r.t. the telescope site)
are usually shared with the telescope users, with the only purpose to minimize the astro-
nomical data loss by giving them the opportunity to choose suitable countermeasures, if
these latter are available at the telescope. For instance, such information allows the user
to conveniently set the local oscillator frequency, down converting only the less-polluted

telescope (bottom). Medicina mobile laboratory and 22-m-high tower in background (top

portion of the selected receiver frequency band. Also, users can take advantage of other
on-line and off-line strategies addressed to the mitigation or cancellation of the received
RFI (see Sect. 4.1 and 4.2).

The RFI teams also represent the Italian radio astronomical community to both the
national authority responsible for the spectrum regulatory issues (Ministry of Economic
Development) and the Committee on Radio Astronomy Frequencies (CRAF), which acts
on frequency issues for European radio astronomy and related sciences. Results from
the monitoring campaigns are shared with these national and international authorities,
reporting information on the RFI affecting radio astronomy observations and, in partic-
ular, the RAS frequency sub-bands.
In the framework of this national coordination, the
following Subsections describe the results of measurement campaigns at the observing
sites, highlighting the methods adopted, the RFI scenario and its time evolution, and some
examples highlighting the importance of a cooperative effort among the RFI groups.

3.1 RFI coordinated monitoring at the Medicina telescope

Two radiotelescopes are operated at the Medicina station: the 32-m parabolic dish and
the Northern Cross antenna array. The ﬁrst one is a fully-steerable Cassegrain antenna

9

offered to the radio astronomical community for single dish and VLBI experiments. The
telescope is equipped with dual-polarization receivers distributed between the primary
and the Cassegrain focal positions: four cryogenic (coaxial S- and X-band, C-low-band
and dual-feed k-band) and two room-temperature ones (L- and C-high bands), operating
in the frequency range 1.35-26.5 GHz. A cryogenic, dual-polarization and dual-feed Ku
receiver is under construction to ﬁll the gap in the frequency range 13.5-18 GHz and this
band is thus included in the RFI monitoring campaigns. The Northern Cross is a transit
interferometer composed by hundreds of parabolic dipoles arranged in a wide ’T’ shape for
a total collecting area of about 30000 square meters. The array observes in a frequency
range of a few MHz centered at 408 MHz and is recently undergoing an upgrade of its
northern arm receivers.

The ﬁxed station operated by the local RFI group to monitor the RAS and the (wider)
receiver frequency bands is equipped with several types of antennas covering the fre-
quency ranges 0.1-12 GHz and 22-24 GHz. The antenna set (dual polarization: V+H) and
the equipment to select, ﬁlter, amplify the signal coming from each antenna is mounted
on a rotating mast located on the top of a 22-m high tower, equipped with an electro-
mechanical rotor allowing a 360-degree monitoring in the azimuth plane. Ad hoc mea-
surements are also performed by means of a mobile laboratory, a FIAT Ducato van
equipped with a set of antennas, covering the frequency range .310-40 GHz, which can
be mounted one at a time on a telescopic mast capable of a 360-degree rotation in the
horizontal plane. Apart from the continuous monitoring routinely conducted to provide
an up-to-date knowledge of the RFI scenario around the telescope site, further mea-
surements are carried out whenever the telescope users report the detection of polluting
signals during their scientiﬁc observations. Tables 4 and 5 in Appendix A list the main
characteristics of the Medicina ﬁxed and mobile monitoring stations respectively.

The sistematic campaigns for RFI monitoring started many years ago have allowed
to verify the long term, ever-increasing level of man-made radio signals polluting the fre-
quency band of the telescope receivers. As an example, in recent years the C-low and
S-receiver frequency bands (1.5 GHz and 0.16 GHz wide respectively) have been pol-
luted by signals from broad-band digital radio links, Wireless LAN and HiperLAN that are
increasingly widespread in the populated areas around the Medicina site. Broad-band ra-
dio digital links are the main polluting sources even in the C-high and K frequency bands
(1.2 GHz and 8.5 GHz wide respectively), even if at a lower level than the C-low- and
S- ones, according to the reports from telescope users. RFI signals from the 5G mo-
bile phone network have been recently detected in the K-frequency band, while polluting
signals from 4G-LTE devices continue to occupy the L-frequency band. Furthermore, im-
pulsive broad-band radar transmissions and satellite downlinks are detected in the L- and
X- frequency bands respectively as well as at the frequencies of the under-construction
Ku-band receiver, which is also polluted by emissions from digital links, short range de-
vices and more recently by Starlink satellite signals. Table 1 shows an estimate of the RFI
spectral occupancy percentage at Medicina in the last years. These numbers cannot be
directly compared with those obtained for SRT and Noto with a different modus operandi
(see Section 3.2), but they however permit an evaluation of the local RFI scenario. The
C-low receiver is by far the most polluted one, with an RFI spectral occupation percentage
of 45% and increasing in time. This is mainly due to disturbing signals from broadband

digital links and HiperLAN emission. Broadband digital links are the main source of RFI
also in the C-high and K frequency ranges, with a percentage occupancy equal to 25%
and 5% respectively.
Impulsive broadband radar transmissions and satellite downlinks
are affecting the L frequency band, more signiﬁcantly at the lower frequencies, and im-
pacting at a much lower level also the X and Ku frequency ranges. The latter in particular
is polluted also by emission from digital links and short-term devices.

This operational approach based on coordinated measurements with both the ﬁxed
and the mobile stations is efﬁcient also in the detection of RFI affecting radio telescopes
distant from each other. This is the case for instance, of the polluting signal emitted by
a satellite and received in the 406.1-410 MHz frequency band (allocated to the RAS with
primary use status) at both the Medicina and the SRT sites. Thanks to coordinated RFI
monitoring, the source signal was identiﬁed and its frequency spectrum recorded by both
the Medicina and SRT RFI stations, see Figure 2.

The spectra show the polluting signal received in a 50 kHz frequency range centered
at 409 MHz after setting the spectrum analyzer with a spectral resolution of a few kHz in
average mode. After accurate investigations, the signal turned out to be compatible with
the signal carrier transmitted at 402 MHz by a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite, known in
the satellite catalogue as OPTOS n.39420. Medicina and SRT radio telescopes detected
its emission during its transit at the Italian meridian. Such disturbing signal has been
reported to the satellite company, who collaboratively acted on the down-link transmission
to mitigate the interference. Since then, this spurious signal has been no more detected.

3.2 RFI Monitoring Campaigns in Sardinia and Sicily with the SRT

mobile laboratory

In order to characterize the radio environment in the frequency bands at which the Sar-
dinia and Noto telescopes operate, the local RFI teams put together resources and efforts

11

Figure 2: RFI signal in the 406.1-410 MHz RAS primary use band, detected at Medicina
with the RFI tower (spectrum on the left) and at the SRT site with the mobile laboratory
(spectrum on the right). The RFI was due to a spurious emission in the signal transmitted
by a LEO Spanish satellite called OPTOS n.39420

to perform three intensive measurement campaigns in December 2014 and May 2016 at
Noto and in November 2016 at SRT taking advantage of the coordination and funds from
the INAF Techno PRIN project mentioned in Section 2. Surveys were conducted in the
frequency range 0.3-40 GHz by using, at both sites, the SRT mobile laboratory [17, 18].
Such measurements provided for the ﬁrst time an overview of the RFI scenario surround-
ing the Noto radio telescope. At the same time, they allowed the update of the RFI
scenario at the SRT just before offering the telescope for open-sky observations.
At both sites the RFI teams carried out several radio measurements by choosing differ-
ent conﬁgurations of the mobile station receiving system (see Appendix B) and using the
following modus operandi. First, a suitable location on top of a hill close to the telescope
is chosen to allow a free-space 360-degrees azimuth scan of the antenna mounted on
top of the van mast. Secondly, the large frequency range is split into several sub-bands.
For each sub-band, four azimuth scans (two for each polarization) are performed and the
related spectra are acquired by the spectrum analyzer in max-hold mode by setting the
instrument ﬁrst in a broad-band (resolution bandwidth RBW = 3 MHz), then in narrow-
band (RBW = 0.1 MHz) conﬁguration. The 3 MHz- and 0.1 MHz-RBW spectra are used
for broad-band/impulsive and narrow-band signal types respectively. In both cases, the
operator sets a total number of spectral samples (up to a maximum of 8000 points al-
lowed by the spectrum analyser on board of the SRT RFI mobile station) such that the
resulting frequency bin is smaller than the chosen RBW. The spectrum analyzer RBWs
were chosen after some preliminary measurements addressed to ﬁgure out how to better
represent the RFI scenario surrounding the telescopes. At the top of a nearby hill the
antenna is then lifted at a height of 10 m above the ground and a full horizontal plane
(hereafter ’panoramic’) spectrum is acquired every 360-deg rotation of the mast, lasting
∼60 seconds at a constant speed of ∼6 deg/s. In such a way four (H- and V- polarized,
narrow- and broad-band conﬁguration) spectra are available for each sub-band. After

12

completing all such scans the operator moves the van in a second strategic location,
closer to the telescope and offering similar full view of the horizon, and a new acquisition
is started with the spectrum analyzer in the same conﬁguration as before. In such a way,
homologous spectra of the same radio environment acquired at two different locations can
be then compared. To this aim the operator initially selects and combines those spectra
that better represent the RFI signals received in each of the telescope frequency bands.
The channel gain (see Tables 6 and 7) is removed from the data to retrieve the power
level at the antenna input. Consequently, information on the received polluting signals
like the maximum power level and its frequency, the bandwidth and polarization and the
RFI type (impulsive, periodic, etc.) can be extracted. Whenever RFI is detected in RAS
subbands, signal maximization at three different measurement sites permits to identify
the polluting source coordinates. Comparison between levels of the same (steady) RFI
signals in spectra acquired from different surveying sites would allow the identiﬁcation of
the effective RFI signal strength expected at the telescope location. This modus operandi
allows a wider characterisation of the RFI scenario, including those disturbing signals that
are attenuated or not measured at all by the mobile station antenna at the location closer
to the telescope, but that would however be detected by the telescope itself thanks to its
greater height above the ground. In addition, it allows the identiﬁcation of spurious signals
generated locally by power lines, electronic apparatus and other active radio frequency
sensors that, due to the site orography, would not be detectable by the mobile station at
the location far from the telescope.

By means of the information collected in the measurement campaigns it has been
possible to compute the lower limit for the RFI occupancy of the frequency bands for the
existing and future receivers at the Noto and Sardinia telescopes (see Tables 6 and 7).
The uncertainty on the occupancy percentage is strictly related to the RF receiver sensi-
tivity and the spectrum analyzer settings of the mobile lab. To do that, for each frequency
band we summed the spectral occupancy of the signals classiﬁed as RFI on the basis of
the comparison between homologous (same frequency range and polarisation) spectra.
0.1 MHz- and 3 MHz-RBW spectra are used to better characterize the power level and
bandwidth of the RFI signals. Finally, the total RFI spectral occupancy is calculated in
terms of percentage w.r.t. the extent of the receiver frequency bands and sub-bands.
The radio monitoring reported in this Section lasted ﬁve consecutive days for each cam-
paign. The 360-degrees panoramic spectra acquired during these measurements are
characterised by an angular resolution equal to the antenna Half Power Beam Width.
Given the duration of each panoramic scan, this means that the exposure time per pixel
(i.e. the HPBW integration time) varies from a maximum of 8 s (for the LPA 370-10 an-
tenna having a HPBW equal to 48 deg @ .370 GHz) to 1.1 s (for the DRGH 1840-A
HPBW equal to 7 deg @ 33 GHz), see Tables 6 and 7 in Appendix B. The information
provided by these panoramic spectra are thus to be considered as snapshot views of
the instantaneous RFI landscape at the site. The database of panoramic radio spectra
obtained during these campaigns does not give a complete representation of the local
RFI scenario (which would be possible only by means of a continuous monitoring) and
is referred speciﬁcally to the year 2016. Nevertheless, it provides a wealth of information
which can orient the speciﬁc design of the ‘local optimum’ RFI mitigation strategy and is
useful to prepare ad-hoc countermeasures. Also, this information can be compared with

13

more recent measurements and thus used to evaluate the evolution of the RFI scenario.
In the following sub-sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, we summarize the main results of the
radio monitoring performed by means of the modus operandi described above. Moreover,
we report some examples of further investigations triggered by the radio monitoring itself
and aimed at identifying the direction and geographical position of RFI sources emitting
in the RAS frequency bands. Finally, in Tables 2 and 3 we give an estimation of the RFI
spectral occupancy percentage in the receiver frequency bands and sub-bands at SRT in
Nov 2016 and at Noto in May 2016 respectively.

3.2.1 RFI Monitoring Campaign at SRT

The SRT is a general-purpose 64-m quasi-Gregorian reﬂector operated by INAF and the
Italian Space Agency (ASI) for 80% and 20% of the available antenna time respectively.
Currently SRT is equipped with four dual-polarization cryogenic receivers: a L- and P-
band coaxial feed, a K-band 7-feed planar array and a C-high mono-feed operated by
INAF and a single-polarization cryogenic X-band receiver dedicated to planetary probes
tracking and radio science experiments and operated by ASI. Both single dish and VLBI
observations are possible in the non-continuous frequency coverage 0.305-26.5 GHz [21].
Since 2009 the SRT receivers frequency bands, especially those allocated to the RAS,
have been regularly monitored mainly by means of the mobile laboratory. Before the start
of SRT scientiﬁc observations in 2016 the local RFI team in collaboration with the Noto
group intensiﬁed the RFI monitoring carrying out an intensive ﬁve-days measurement
campaign in the frequency range 0.3-40 GHz. The setup of the mobile laboratory and
its instrumentation during this campaign are summarized in Table 6. Two measurement
locations were chosen, the ﬁrst one on a mountain hill, called Monte Ixi, located about
2 km from the telescope and the second on a pitch less than 1 km in the same val-
ley where the telescope is placed. The main results of this RFI campaign are reported
in Table 2. The ﬁrst two columns list the SRT receiver names, their frequency ranges
and the related sub-bands including the RAS and SR allocations, i.e. Exclusive Primary
(EP), shared Primary (P) or Secondary (S) use status. The third column shows the noise
ﬂoor level measured by the spectrum analyzer in each frequency range (representing the
sum of the intrinsic system noise and the environment noise), corrected by the RF chain
gain and expressed in terms of spectral power ﬂux density (dBW m−2Hz−1). Consider-
ing homologous spectra, similar values of the noise ﬂoor have been measured in the 0.1
MHz- and 3 MHz-RBW spectra for all the frequency ranges, except for the P- and L-band
ones. Due to broad-band electromagnetic disturbances radiated by power lines in the
P band and by radar plants in the L band, at these frequencies the 3 MHz-RBW spec-
tra, acquired at the location closer to the telescope, have a noise ﬂoor larger than that
measured in the 0.1 MHz-RBW spectra at the same site. Since the power line polluting
emission has a sporadic occurrence which depends mainly on weather conditions, in the
third column of Table 2 for the P-band receiver we list values of the noise ﬂoor measured
in two different days, when these RFI signals were (-180 dBW m−2Hz−1) or were not (-
185 dBW m−2Hz−1) detected. Similarly for the L band, we report values for the noise
ﬂoor of -174 and -172 dBW m−2Hz−1 measured in different days, showing the increase
due to polluting emission when the antenna scan approaches the azimuth direction of the

14

radar plant. The last two columns of Table 2 list the percentage RFI spectral occupancy
calculated in the RAS and SR sub-bands, and in the receiver full frequency band respec-
tively. Preliminary measurements showed that, between the two measurement locations,
the one closer to the telescope better represent what the telescope receivers detect in the
same frequency range.

Comparing the percentage spectral occupancy, the P band turns out to be the most
polluted by RFI signal from power lines and digital links, with a slightly larger incidence
in the horizontal polarization (43%) than in the vertical one (38%). Considering the RAS
sub-bands in this frequency range, vertically polarized RFI signals were detected with
spectral occupancy of 28%. No horizontally polarized disturbances were measured in
any of the RAS or SR frequency sub-bands. The RFI spectral occupancy calculation
in the P band does not take into account the sporadic and unpredictable contribution of
broad-band emission from power lines that, when detected, generally pollute most of the
band making RFI monitoring almost useless and radio astronomical data very difﬁcult to
analyze. The presence of such disturbing signals has been reported to the national com-
pany in charge of the electric power distribution. Maintenance interventions in some of
the power lines around the site have been executed, but further intervention would be
needed to deﬁnitively solve the issue. The L-band frequency range shows a prevalence
of H-polarized RFI signals (24%) with respect to V-polarized ones (12%), mostly due to
radar plants, cell phone networks and in a few cases to satellite down-links. In particular,
impulsive emission from a radar plant pollute mainly two out of the ﬁve RAS frequency
sub-bands. The 1330-1400 MHz RAS sub-band has a shared secondary use status and
RFI occupancy percentages of 56% and 11% in H- and V-polarized signals. The 1400-
1427 MHz RAS sub-band is allocated to exclusive primary use, no V-polarized disturbing
signals were detected but the spectral occupancy due to the horizontally polarized ones
reaches 44%. RFI in the RAS sub-bands has been detected and characterized since the
beginning of the monitoring with the mobile laboratory and the unauthorized signals have
been reported to the local and national authorities. The remaining frequency range up to
40 GHz appear to be essentially clean of RFI with worst-case occupancy percentages of
the order of 8%, except for some signals due to HiperLan and WiFi-LAN services in C-low
and C-high bands as well as the effect of some digital links in the C-high, K, S, C-low
and X frequency ranges. Remarkably, in the S frequency range the third RAS sub-band
allocated to shared secondary use has spectral occupancy percentages of 28% and 14%
in H- and V-polarization respectively. The X-frequency sub-band, allocated in shared pri-
mary use to the SR service, is scarcely polluted with RFI spectral occupancy percentages
reaching 5% and in H-polarization. It is worth noting that the K frequency range is almost
clean except for the H-polarized disturbing signal from a broad-band digital link occupying
5% (about 30 MHz) of the total frequency bandwidth.

Figure 3 shows V- and H-polarized 3 MHz-RBW spectra in the band of the C-low
receiver currently under construction, as measured during a dedicated RFI monitoring
session. The RAS sub-bands 4.825-4.835 GHz and 4.95-5.0 GHz, shared as secondary
use allocation with other services, appear clean of RFI but broad-band radio services
(HiperLan) are increasingly occupying the higher portion of the C-low spectral range.

After the intensive RFI measurement campaign in 2016, the receiver frequency ranges
of the SRT have been routinely monitored by means of both the ﬁxed station, leveraging

zontal (H-, black line) and the vertical (V-, light blue line) panoramic spectra were acquired
at the location closer to the telescope with the spectrum analyzer in 3 MHz-RBW mode.
The spectra power level has been corrected for the gain of the mobile laboratory receiver
(channel D). The RAS secondary-allocation sub-bands are free from RFI, but the higher
frequencies in the C-low range are getting increasingly polluted by broad-band radio ser-
vices (HiperLan)

the same telescope sensitivity, and the mobile laboratory. A dedicated, real-time monitor-
ing of the 100-2100 MHz IF baseband of the telescope, including the receiver polariza-
tions, is currenlty available in piggy-back mode by means of a spectrum analyser and a
dedicated LabVIEW software [19]. This allowed to update the information from the 2016
campaign, showing a little evolution of the RFI scenario at SRT with small differences
mainly due to new RFI emitters. Detrimental effects on radio astronomical experiments
still persist in the P- and L-band frequency ranges. In addition, new RFI emissions at UHF
frequencies caused by the enlargement of the national Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA)
network for emergency services and public safety started to affect the P band. Luckily,
these disturbances are spatially conﬁned in a narrow solid angle and at low antenna el-
evations (∼ 6 deg). Also, the enlargement of the cell phone network with the installation
of new 4G-LTE stations around the SRT site caused an increase of the RFI spectral oc-
cupancy in the L band above 1700 MHz. In the C-low and C-high frequency ranges, in
particular above 5000 MHz, the RFI spectral occupancy increased due to emission from
new HiperLan services. Also, impulsive signals emitted by weather radar plant recently
activated in the northern Sardinia have been detected. Also, the RFI monitoring in piggy-

16

back mode allowed to more frequently detect emissions from different type of satellite
services in the P, L and K bands.

3.2.2 RFI measurement campaigns at the Noto telescope

The 32-m Noto telescope is the Medicina twin antenna but, unlike the latter, it is equipped
with an active surface for efﬁcient high-frequency observations. The receiver frequency
range (1.3-43.5 GHz) available for VLBI and single dish observations is summarized in
Table 7. Five dual-polarisation, mono-feed receivers are operating in the L, C-high, C-low,
K and Q bands, the last three being cryogenically cooled. A coaxial, dual-polarization and
dual-frequency receiver is available in the S/X bands. It is worth noting that in Table 7 we
consider the whole frequency range of the L-band receiver (1.3-1.8 GHz).
Two ﬁrst intensive RFI measurement campaigns, lasting one week each, were carried out
in the frequency range 0.3-40 GHz at the Noto telescope in December 2014 [23] and May
2016 by means of the SRT RFI mobile laboratory, see Figure 1. Both campaigns were
executed applying the modus operandi and RFI occupancy calculation described in Sec-
tion 3.2, with the same spectrum analyzer settings. The comparison between homologous
spectra acquired at different locations and in different epochs allows a characterisation of
the RFI scenario and its evolution. A mountain plateau (Monte Rhenna) rising at 600 m
above the sea level and located at about 3 km from the telescope was chosen as the mea-
surement site for higher altitude monitoring. The second site, located close to the radio
astronomical Noto Station, was chosen for RFI monitoring in the telescope proximity.

Table 3 summarizes the results of the 2016 campaign in terms of percentage of the
RFI spectral occupancy, computed mainly considering the measurements at the location
closer to the telescope. The spectra acquired at the measurement site on Monte Rhenna
were used only to better identify the RFI signals, but not to calculate the RFI spectral oc-
cupancy. The reader can refer to [23] for more details about the previous 2014 campaign.
For each frequency range listed in the ﬁrst column of Table 3 we report the noise ﬂoor
measured in the 0.1 MHz- and 3 MHz-RBW spectra which, once expressed in term of
dBW m−2Hz−1, has a similar value in both RBW conﬁgurations. Unlike the results of the
RFI monitoring at SRT, the noise ﬂoor in the L band measured at the Noto radio astronom-
ical Station was not affected by broad-band signals. Comparing the L-band RFI spectral
occupancy values in Tables 3 and 2, it is evident that this frequency range is less polluted
at Noto than at SRT (10% against 24%) irrespectively of the polarization. Although the
RFI sources in this spectral range are the same (radar plants, satellites downlink and cell
phone networks), the Noto radio astronomical Station is geographically less exposed. In
fact, no signal was measured in the RAS sub-bands allocated for exclusive primary and
shared secondary use, except for the 1330-1400 MHz one where the RFI spectral occu-
pancy reaches 44% (in both polarizations) due to radar emission. Even if the telescope
is not currently equipped with a P band receiver, during the 2016 campaign we monitored
Interestingly, detrimental effects similar to those ob-
this frequency range also at Noto.
server at the SRT were measured in the P band due to power line emissions close to the
Noto telescope. Those polluting signals were recorded in order to possibly report them to
the national company responsible of the electric power distribution.

The S-band and C-low frequency ranges are almost clean except for some narrow-

17

band signals that occupy a spectral percentage up to 8% in vertical polarization in the
S-band range. The remaining frequency ranges, C-high, X and K, resulted totally clear in
the 2016 campaign.

More recent measurements performed in 2021 with the new, portable Noto RFI sta-
tion [20] conﬁrmed the 2016 results for the C-high and X frequency ranges. However, the
RFI scenario at the Noto telescope has been continuously evolving mainly in L, S and
C-low bands due to radar plants emission and the increasing diffusion of signals coming
from mobile phones, wi-ﬁ and HiperLan networks. Figure 36 in [20] shows the evolution
of RFI signals in the receiver L-band at different epochs as measured with the SRT mo-
bile laboratory and the new Noto RFI station. The RFI spectral occupancy in the RAS
L sub-bands has not changed, however it has signiﬁcantly increased in the receiver full
frequency range mostly due to radar and cell phone networks emission. In fact, L-band
measurements done in 2021 nearby the Noto radio astronomical Station show an in-
creased RFI spectral occupancy of 35% with respect to the 10% level measured in 2016,
see Table 3). A signiﬁcant increase of the RFI spectral occupancy in the S frequency
range was measured as well, with percentages that in 2021 reached a value of 20% in
both polarizations due to Wi-Fi networks.

For what concerns the C-low frequency range, some differences were measured in
the 2016 spectra with respect to the 2014 and 2021 epochs. In fact, by comparing homol-
ogous spectra acquired at the location closer to the telescope, the frequency range was
almost clear in 2014, with no polluting signal measured in the RAS secondary use sub-
bands and only a few narrow-band RFI with spectral occupancy less than 1% in the whole
receiver frequency range. In 2016 the RFI spectral occupancy changed due to some V-
polarized signals emitted by a Hiperlan network, occupying mainly the 4950-5000 MHz
RAS secondary use sub-band. It is worth noting that HiperLANs are not included among
the services sharing the use of this RAS sub-band. The broad-band (∼16 MHz band-
width) RFI emitted by an unauthorized HiperLAN transmitter has been detected in the
frequency range 4962-4978 MHz mostly as a V-polarization signal, but a non-negligible
H-polarization component has been measured as well (see Figure 4). Follow-up investi-
gations and signal maximization at three different measurement sites permitted to identify
the polluting source, resulting to be a transmitting antenna mounted on top of a water
tank tower located in a village about 7 km from the telescope (see bottom left panel in
Figure 4). The Noto RFI group reported the information on those interfering signals to
the local administration deputed to enforcing the spectrum allocation. As a consequence,
the HiperLAN transmitter was switched off, the C-low RAS sub-bands have been freed
from RFI and the whole receiver frequency range was again only poorly polluted. Then, a
recent radio monitoring performed in 2021 by using the new portable RFI station recorded
new, unidentiﬁed broad-band H-polarized RFI signals in the frequency range 4920-4960
MHz. New investigations are needed to characterize this new HiperLan-like emission and
to measure the consequent effective spectral occupancy.
It is worth noting that measurement updates at higher frequencies in the K and Q bands
will be possible with the extension of the spectral coverage of the portable RFI station,
currently operating up to 18 GHz ([20]).

4 Mitigation strategies

The characterization of the RFI local scenario is propedeutic to the implementation of RFI
mitigation techniques based on on-line and off-line excision/cancellation to minimize the
effect of RFI on the data. Such techniques include the use of digital spectrometers for
data acquisition and the post-detection signal processing for RFI cleaning.

Digital spectrometers characterised by high time and frequency sampling rate and
broad-band are becoming the standard backends for radio astronomical observations.
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology are often used as the main comput-
ing engine and can be exploited to perform real-time RFI detection during data acquisition.
In recent years, state-of-the-art digital backends exploiting the publicly available software
by the CASPER consortium (http://casper-dsp.org/) have been available at the SRT and
Medicina, and will be installed at Noto.
In this evolving digital domain, telescope staff
gained experience in the procurement and usage of FPGA-based systems as developed
by the CASPER consortium, enabling the research of new solutions in the ﬁelds of beam-
forming and digital FX correlation [8] that can easily be applied to single dish data elabo-
ration. In order to improve our in-house capabilities in the design and implementation of
digital spectrometers, we applied the experience gained in the use of such FPGA-based
systems to the development of ﬁrmware tailored for the processing of single-dish data
from the italian radio telescopes, as described in Section 4.1.

Once spectropolarimetric data are acquired, RFI can be cleaned off-line in the spatial
and spectral domain by means of dedicated software. To this aim we have developed
a prototype tool for RFI inspection and ﬂagging, described in Section 4.2. This tool has
been speciﬁcally designed to exploit the multi-feed capabilities of receivers installed at the
Italian radio telescopes. DW is optimized for the ﬂagging of huge amounts of data and
can be fully integrated in a pipeline chain for single-dish data processing.

4.1 The digital spectrometer

The hardware system provides analog to digital conversion, real-time elaboration in the
digital domain and transmission of resulting data to the control system for further elabo-
ration and storage. This is accomplished by means of a single ROACH board equipped
with two iADC converter boards having 8 bit resolution and dynamical range of 48 dB
and performing signal digitization at 2 Gigasample per second. The signal of one po-
larisation is converted to a digital stream of 8-bit signed data at 2 GHz. Data is then
processed by means of the onboard XILINX Virtex5 FPGA device. With this hardware
setup common to the three Italian radio telescopes, we developed a digital spectrometer
delivering a bandwidth of 780 MHz for each polarization, with 1024 or 4096 frequency
channels and 1 ms minimum dump time and integration period. The two polarizations are
analyzed simultaneously and data are output over a 10 Gigabit ethernet link.So far, the
digital spectrometer allows for total intensity measurements only. To deal with high-power
signals such as RFI, the ﬁrmware modules have been developed in order to optimize sig-
nal dynamics by monitoring possible overﬂows at each stage of the elaboration, starting
from the digital conversion. Timing precision has been a design requirement in order to
describe fast-moving or even transient phenomena with the necessary accuracy.

22

Figure 5: Firmware elaboration stages of the digital spectrometer

Figure 6: Instrumental setup during test commissioning of the WBLGL spectrometer at
the SRT

The digital chain follows two parallel paths for signal processing and for spectrometer
control and metadata management. The ﬁrmware elaboration stages are described in
Figure 5. As data are converted into the digital domain by the ADC, a Polyphase Filter
Bank (6 nodes, >50 dB channel isolation) transforms the time domain signal into the
frequency domain outputting 4096 frequency bins in complex form. The power spectrum
is then computed and a conﬁgurable gain multiplies the obtained signal so that only the
relevant bits are kept for further integration. Both the output data rate and the integration
time can be controlled by integrating power spectra on board of the FPGA, exploiting
memory cells on the FPGA itself.

Control logics are implemented directly on the FPGA, where some registers are acces-
sible to the control software via a PowerPC processor embedded into the ROACH board.

23

Figure 7: K-band emission of the W3(OH) water maser, acquired with position-switching
observing mode and ﬂux calibrated using the calibrator source 3C48

Data are time-stamped by means of a 64 bit posix TIME register which sets the current
time directly on the FPGA. Data acquisition and elaboration is continuous, the digital shift
and gain can be tuned to the power level of the input signal and the number of power
spectra to be accumulated in a frame is set by a dedicated register. Overﬂow diagnostic
is executed at any digital processing stage to monitor the presence of artifacts created
during the data elaboration in the presence of strong RFI signals. At the end of every
integration, an UDP frame is created which also contains the meta information related
to the integrated spectrum, like the gain and integration values, the overﬂow status and
the posix timestamp. A basic Python-based control software module called WideBand
Lowpass GigaBit (WBLGB) has been developed to access the ROACH functionalities.
WBLGB makes use of the TCP/IP-based Karoo Array Telescope Control Protocol 3 to
conﬁgure the board setup and control, like for instance the FPGA ﬁrmware version, the
sampling frequency or network parameters for data transmission, and to inspect interme-
diate processing stages.

First observing tests aimed at validating the basic functionalities of the spectrometer
were carried out at the Sardinia Radio Telescope. The observing setup is illustrated in
Figure 6. The WBLGL backend delivered 4096 spectral channels over 780 MHz band-
width on a single polarisation. Integrated spectra were continuously acquired with a time
sampling of 2 ms, a limit set by the disk I/O performance of the recording system. To
monitor the performance of the spectrometer, data acquisition was executed in parallel
with both the ROACH backend and the spectrum analyser in use at the SRT.

Figure 9: SRT L-band spectrogram of a radar RFI signal detected by WBLGL with 5 ms
(top) and 2 ms (bottom) resolution. Time intervals are 0.5 s and 0.3 s respectively

The capability of WBLGL in detecting different types of RFI signal and its performances
in terms of time and frequency resolution have been tested by observing well-known radio
astronomical objects as well as some RFI sources known to affect the SRT site. An
estimate of the backend dynamic range has been obtained at 22 GHz, which is currently
the frequency band less affected by RFI signals at the SRT (Figure 7). Position-switching
observations of the W3OH water maser were calibrated by means of the primary ﬂux
calibrator 3C48, whose ﬂux is 1.2 Jy at 22 GHz. The backend dynamics allowed us to
measure a line-to-noise ratio of ≈ 6000, in line with the expected performances of this
type of digital instrumentation.

The spectrograms in Figure 8 and 9 illustrate some examples of RFI signals measured
in the P and L bands. The frequency on the horizontal axis refers to the RF of the signal
chain, while the vertical axis shows the time from the start of the acquisition.

Figure 8 shows a 1 s-long acquisition with 10 ms temporal resolution in the P band
with the telescope observing an azimuth scan at low elevation in the direction of a nearby
power line. During this acquisition the well-known RFI caused by the power line (see

26

Section 3.2.1) was not detected, and as a consequence it was possible to detect a large
number of other interfering signals. It was then possible to test the capability of the spec-
trometer in isolating the numerous RFI without overﬂowing. The 10 ms temporal resolution
enables a detailed characterization of the terrestrial continuous signal, as can be seen in
the sinusoidal view (vertical panel on the right of the plot) that describes the time domain
evolution of the signal in the selected frequency bin.

Radars, satellite downlinks and cell phone network signals were detected when ob-
serving in the L band, as expected.
In particular, an intermittent radar signal was ob-
served to verify the capabilities in describing a short, periodic signal with different time
resolutions. Acquisitions were done with time resolutions of 5 and 2 ms, this last being
the maximum time resolution achievable with the adopted WBLGL conﬁguration. Figure 9
illustrates the granularity with which the timing of the interfering signal can be described
in a 0.5 s-long integration with 5 ms time resolution and in a 0.3 s-long integration with 2
ms time resolution, with negligible effects on the remaining spectrogram.

A strong RFI signal at 5896 MHz due to a digital link is continuously detected in the C
band data and has been observed with different time resolutions of 10 and 100 millisec-
onds, and 1 second. No saturation issues were detected during the sampling and the
subsequent digital elaboration stages.

Results of these tests demonstrated the robustness of WBLGL in detecting RFI sig-
nals with different characteristics in terms of periodicity, shape and in particular strength
without incurring in instrumental saturation while preserving the measurement capabilities
of the astronomical targets.

4.2 Dish Washer: a prototype ofﬂine RFI Mitigation Tool

To complement the monitoring and mitigation activities described in the previous Sections
we developed the Dish Washer (DW) interactive tool for single-dish data inspection, RFI
detection and ﬂagging [24]. DW has been speciﬁcally built to handle the single-dish data
delivered by the Italian radio telescopes ([25]) and is optimized for multi-feed receivers
like those currently in use at Medicina and the SRT. Such receivers simultaneously output
a large number of data streams from adjacent sky positions that may be affected by the
same RFI signature and demand for a simultaneous processing for an efﬁcient ﬂagging.
As an example, the SARDARA backend [7] at the SRT coupled with the 7-feeds K-band
receiver may produce 7x4 full-Stokes spectropolarimetric data streams from a spatially
coherent region of the sky, each stream consisting of up to 16384 spectral channels over
a bandwidth up to 2 GHz.

DW ﬂagging can be performed by interactively inspecting the various data streams and
the ﬂagging process can be sped up by propagating the ﬂagging table obtained for one
data stream to the others, both in the spatial and the spectropolarimetric domain. Flagged
regions are listed in a dedicated FITS table associated to the input data and ready for use
in subsequent data processing pipelines for actual RFI excision. Meta-data information is
saved for each ﬂagged region and method applied, to allow for the reconstruction of the
ﬂagging history for the given data set. An example of interactive DW session is shown in
Figure 10.

From a software point of view DW consists of three Python sub-packages and a C
library. The main sub-package implements core functionalities like data structure deﬁ-
nition, I/O, manual ﬂagging and the interface to the automatic ﬂagging sub-package(s).
Data formats other than those in use at the Italian radio telescopes can be supported by
adding the proper methods of the relevant I/O class in a transparent way to the rest of the
package. A second sub-package implements the framework for the RFI detection algo-
rithms and an interface to the C librabry which in turn implements ﬂagging methods by
taking advantage of C-language efﬁciency (including OpenMP parallel computing 4). The
third sub-package implements the graphical user interface (GUI) and acts as an interface
to the main sub-package and its dependencies. Such an approach allows the function-
alities provided by DW to be accessed in different ways and to be available in different
scenarios. While the GUI is best suited for interactive ﬂagging sessions, the main sub-
package can be imported in a Python console of choice or a script in a batch processing
scenario, or even integrated in a third-party application to provide data IO and ﬂagging
capabilities. Finally, the ﬂagging Python sub-package and C library can be used to enable
automatic ﬂagging in applications with their own data format or different target use case.
Figure 10 shows an example of DW session. The leftmost area contains information on
the dataset structure (receiver feeds and backend spectral sections) and the data subset
to be ﬂagged can be selected. Meta-data relevant for RFI analysis such as the Horizontal
coordinates, time and date of observation and ﬂagging meta-data (if present) are also
showed. The central panel shows the dynamical spectrum of the selected subset, which
can be inspected by means of cross cuts, zoom on areas, adjustments of contrast and
intensity levels. Flagged areas are shown as shaded regions on the dynamical spectrum.
The rightmost part of the GUI list all the data streams of the selected subset - for instance
the Stokes parameters - and the ﬂagged regions that were created. Buttons and menus
at the top of the GUI enable interactive actions such as the identiﬁcation and ﬂagging
of RFI-polluted regions, operations on the ﬂagged regions and their propagation to other
streams, e.g.
to different polarization streams or to the several ones coming from the
multiple feeds of a receiver array.

The ﬁrst DW prototype has been released under GNU General Public License 3 and it
is available as a Git repository at https://github.com/dishwasher-rﬁ . The current release
includes the interactive graphical interface and very basic methods for manual ﬂagging,
based on the identiﬁcation of RFI-polluted regions in the time and spectral domain. The
implementation of automatic ﬂagging procedures will be available in a future version of
the DW code.

5 Summary and Conclusions

We presented a coordinated approach started at the INAF radio telescopes to deal with
the increasing incidence of RFI. The project comprises three main activities: a fully sys-
tematic RFI monitoring at the observing sites, all year around, with dedicated receiving
systems made of mainly commercially available instruments; the original development of

4http://www.openmp.org/

29

digital backends, driven by ﬁrmware suited both for real time RFI identiﬁcation as well as
open to future online mitigation; ﬁnally, in the post-detection phase, the realization of an
off-line tool for RFI ﬂagging in the post-detection phase.

The coordinated RFI monitoring activity, mostly by means of mobile laboratory cam-
paigns and with different approaches and methods applied at the three telescopes, has
been illustrated. Results highlight the different RFI spectral occupancy of the same RF
bands at the different sites, with the Medicina radio telescope being heavily polluted in the
S and C frequency bands, where the diffusion of broad-band communication services is
increasingly playing a crucial role, while the P band at SRT is heavily affected by power
line-generated signals. The L frequency band (low plus high) is the one mostly polluted
at each observing site, mainly due to interfering radar signals and mobile phone services.
The RFI scenario is however undergoing a rapid evolution at all sites, as shown for in-
stance by the increasing saturation of the C band at frequencies higher than 5000 MHz
observed at Medicina and SRT. It is worth noting that the C band at Noto is still free
from signiﬁcant RFI but in some cases unauthorized emission has been reported in the
4950-5000 MHz RAS sub-band, which should thus be monitored with particular attention.
Mobile lab measurements provide an overview and a good estimation of the RFI spectral
occupancy. They are best suited to identify speciﬁc terrestrial signal transmitters and to
proceed with ofﬁcial reports to the local administrative authorities (aimed to switch them
off) but cannot be considered as a complete characterization of the RFI all over the full
RA frequency band of our receivers. Continuous on-site monitoring through dedicated
sessions for each receiver frequency range would be required, in order to leverage the
synergies arising in putting together the different monitoring techniques exploited at the
three sites according to their orography. Nevertheless, results of the monitoring cam-
paigns provide a reference scenario useful to evaluate the evolution of the interference
situation at the telescopes sites.

The characterization of the RFI local scenario is very well suited to optimize the design
of any following strategies of RFI mitigation techniques even if based on on-line or off-line
excision/cancellation. We implemented a prototype digital spectrometer capable of high
signal dynamics and precision timing to be used for on-line RFI mitigation. The ROACH-
based hardware platform was equipped with a ﬁrmware in charge of signal processing,
spectrometer control as well as management of observational data and metadata. The
performances in terms of high dynamical range and sensitivity in both the frequency and
time domains were successfully tested during an observing campaign at the SRT. The
knowledge and expertise acquired in digital backends ﬁrmware development is propedeu-
tic to future realization of backends capable to apply the complex techniques required by
online RFI mitigation. Moreover, as the three Italian antennas share the same telescope
operating system, the software implementation of the ROACH-based backend prototype
and future, similar instrumentation can be easily exported from one radio telescope to
another.

We are concentrating our efforts to apply efﬁcient RFI ﬂagging in the post-acquisition
phase within the DW software tool, speciﬁcally designed for single-dish radio astronomi-
cal data. DW works off-line and is designed to be portable and ﬂexible in order to easily
accommodate future upgrades needed for counteracting new RFI environments. The
DW prototype has been tested on spectro-polarimetric observations from the Italian ra-

30

dio telescopes and is capable to visualize and manipulate the information from different
feeds, spectral sections and polarizations contained in a single dataset. The possibility to
propagate the ﬂagging process to an entire data set (or among different data sets) allow
an efﬁcient processing of the huge data sets delivered by the modern digital backends.
DW ﬁrst prototype is currently released as ope-source software to the community and is
available as a Git repository.

We believe that the described coordinated efforts were successful in identifying useful
solutions to face the present RFI and limit its impact. They also pave the way to further
developments, able to cope with the increasingly complex scenario and the new chal-
lenges we expect to encounter in a near future. It is worth noting that a coordinated effort
in RFI monitoring, together with the availability of similar observing equipment and control
software at the Italian radio telescopes, has an immediate impact also on the coordination
of the astronomical observations. This is particularly true for the two 32-m telescopes at
Medicina and Noto, where observing programs can be in principle reallocated from one
telescope to the other depending on the RFI spectral occupancy of the required receiver
frequency band. This may also extend the concept of dynamical scheduling at the tele-
scopes by adding a possible type of “RFI forecast” to the usual weather monitoring. A very
accurate knowledge of the RFI environment at the radio astronomical sites can also form
the starting point for a national RFI archive. This would on one side facilitate the ongoing
international effort for RFI monitoring and mitigation. On the other side, RFI surveys at
the various sites would provide the astronomical community with valuable knowledge to
plan their scientiﬁc observations in the most effective way.

A Main characteristics of the Medicina RFI ﬁxed and mo-
bile station receiving systems in the frequency bands
of the radio astronomy receivers

Tables 4 and 5 summarize the main characteristics of the receiving systems of the ﬁxed
and mobile RFI stations, respectively, in the frequency bands of the radio astronomy
receivers operating at the Medicina antennas [21]. The ﬁrst column of both Tables 4
and 5 lists the receivers frequency band, starting from the Northern Cross array one
and continuing with those installed on the 32-m reﬂector antenna, including the under-
construction (UC) cryogenic, dual-polarization and dual-feed Ku-band one. RT and RX
names refers to the radio telescope and the receiver names.
In the second and third
columns, we list the name, model, frequency band and isotropic gain of each antenna
usually used to perform the RFI monitoring in the receiver frequency bands listed in the
ﬁrst column. In addition, for each of these frequency bands, the system gain (not including
the antenna gain), the system noise ﬁgure and the system sensitivity evaluated at the
physical temperature of 290 K and in a frequency bandwidth equal to 30 kHz are listed in
fourth, ﬁfth and sixth columns [12, 13, 14, 15].

B Conﬁgurations and instrumentation settings of the SRT
mobile receiving system during the RFI surveys at Sar-
dinian and Sicilian telescopes

The conﬁgurations and the instrumentation characteristics of the mobile station receiving
system, chosen to perform the radio surveys in the frequency range 0.3-40 GHz at SRT
and Noto radiotelescope, are summarized in Tables 6 and 7 respectively. The ﬁrst column
of both tables list the name and the frequency range of the receivers working or under
construction (UC) at the two radiotelescopes [21]. In addition, for each of the frequency
bands listed in the ﬁrst column, the antenna and radio frequency channel characteristics
are summarized from the second to the sixth column. The channel name and its fre-
quency range (second column), the model, the isotropic gain and the half power beam
width (HPBW) of the antenna installed on the top of the van mast (third column), the
channel gain (not including the antenna gain, fourth column), the system noise ﬁgure (NF,
ﬁfth column) and the system sensitivity (last column) are listed. The system sensitivity
has been calculated by adding the system NF (ﬁfth column) to the thermal noise at 290 K
evaluated in a 30 kHz frequency band.
