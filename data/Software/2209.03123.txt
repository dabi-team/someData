Many areas of chemistry are devoted to the challenge of understanding, predicting, and con-
trolling the behavior of strongly localized electrons. Examples include molecular magnetism and
luminescence, color centers in crystals, photochemistry and quantum sensing to name but a few.
Over the years, an amalgam of powerful quantum chemistry methods, simple intuitive models, and
phenomenological parameterizations have been developed, providing increasingly complex and spe-
cialized methodologies. Even with increasing specialization, a pervasive challenge remains that is
surprisingly universal - the simultaneous description of continuous symmetries (e.g. spin and orbital
angular momenta) and discrete symmetries (e.g. crystal ﬁeld). Modeling and predicting behav-
ior in these complex systems is increasingly important for metal ions of unusual or technologically
relevant behavior. Additionally, development and adoption of broad-scope models with physically-
meaningful parameters carries the potential to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and large-
scale meta analysis. Here, we propose a generalized algorithmic approach, the molecular symmetry
adapted spin space (mSASS), to localized electronic structure via descent directly from fermionic
(spin) rather than bosonic (orbital) symmetry. We derive the Hamiltonian in symmetry-constrained
matrix form with an exact account of free parameters and several usage examples. Although prelim-
inary in its implementation, a fundamental beneﬁt of this approach is the treatment of spatial and
spin-orbit symmetries without the need for perturbative approximations. In general, the mSASS
Hamiltonian is large but ﬁnite and can be diagonalized numerically with high eﬃciency, providing a
basis for conceptual models of electronic structure that naturally incorporates spin while leveraging
the intuition and eﬃciency beneﬁts of crystallographic symmetry. For the generation of the mSASS
Hamiltonian, we provide an implementation into the Mathematica Software Package, GTPack.

INTRODUCTION

Chemistry ﬂourishes when synthetic eﬀorts are driven
by intuitive physical models that link structure to func-
tion. An iconic example from molecular chemistry is the
control of the d-orbital manifold of transition metals via
ligand coordination environment. In many cases, a sur-
prising level of insight can be gained through the heuristic
assumptions of a simpliﬁed symmetry and a basic elec-
trostatic model (i.e. Crystal Field Theory; CFT) [1–4].
The limitations of CFT are often cited as evidence for in-
volvement of ligand orbitals and thus the necessity of an
expanded basis allowing for mixing with ligand orbitals
Indeed, benchmark
(Ligand Field Theory; LFT) [5].
structure-function relationships such as the spectrochem-
ical series and nephelauxetic eﬀect [6] require LFT insight
[7]. Rightly so, the inﬂuence of ligand orbitals is consid-
ered foundational knowledge for many chemists. Knowl-
edge of orbital moment and the spin-orbit interaction,
however, is much less pervasive, despite being vital to
understanding of electronic structure, especially for the
d-orbital manifold of many materials of high physical and
technological interest. Even though CFT/LFT models
do not explicitly treat angular momentum, basic quali-
tative predictions can be made in simple cases with only
the Pauli exclusion principle as a guide (e.g. spin-only

models). Caution in this respect is imperative, however,
as the underlying physics of electronic spin is absent here,
limiting insight in both scope and scale.

Recognition of this issue goes back to the advent of
quantum mechanics, and as disciplines became more spe-
cialized, approaches to the problem developed a dizzying
array of formalisms. A common historic theme was that
full spin quantum mechanical modeling or ﬁtting was too
computationally-intensive for practical use, and, in the
end, unnecessary for empirical descriptions of most phe-
nomena. For instance, exclusions of energy states outside
of the range of interest vastly reduces the computational
cost. Such simpliﬁcations trade physically meaningful
operators for phenomenologically parameterized tensors
to compensate for the simpliﬁed basis. Often referred
to as spin Hamiltonians, [8–11], such models are partic-
ularly eﬀective in eﬃciently reproducing magnetometry
and magnetic spectroscopy data of transition metal com-
plexes when the ground state lacks orbital angular mo-
mentum. Developed largely in the context of Electron
Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) [12], spin Hamiltonians
are characterized by a lack of orbital operators with com-
pensation via a phenomenological symmetry-restricted
Hamiltonian acting directly on functions of the spin op-
erators. There are a number of common methods for
perturbations involving the orbital operators where the
symmetry of the local crystal ﬁeld is expanded into oper-
ator equivalents following methods of Stevens [13–15] or
Buckmaster-Smith-Thornley [16], for example. This ap-
proach has proven powerful and eﬃcient, in particular in
situations of well-deﬁned symmetry and low anisotropy.

B. Multi-electron basis

Many-particle basis functions are constructed in terms
of direct products of single particle wave functions. For
electrons, the wave function needs to satisfy fermionic
statistics, i.e., being odd under particle-exchange. This
constraint is satisﬁed by taking the alternating square of
two representations, instead of the ordinary direct prod-
uct [19].

In the following we introduce the characters of SU (2)
representations and the construction of the alternating
square. We start from rotation of angle φ about the
arbitrary axis n, DJ (n, φ), represented as

(1)

DJ (n, φ) = DJ (n(cid:48),

θ)DJ (ez, φ)DJ (n(cid:48), θ),

−
with n(cid:48) and θ being the respective axis and angle
to transform the initial axis n to the ez axis. Due
to the cyclic permutation rule for the trace operation
we obtain for the characters χJ (n, φ) and χJ (ez, φ),
χJ (n, φ) = Tr
=
−
DJ (n(cid:48), θ)DJ (n(cid:48),
θ)DJ (ez, φ)
Tr
=
(cid:2)
−
χJ (ez, φ). Hence, without loss of generality, we focus on
(cid:2)
rotations about the z-axis in the following.

While eﬀective in ﬁtting complex spectral data, there
are reasons to consider alternative approaches to the
crystal ﬁeld expansion. The ﬁrst of these reasons be-
ing the lack of intrinsic physical meaning to the parame-
ters. Without the ability to generate falsiﬁable hypothe-
ses for predicted spin state structure from coordination
environment, progress towards new, overarching models
or technological goals is drastically hindered. Addition-
ally, many of the most exciting systems of current inter-
est are incompatible with the spin Hamiltonian model.
In cases of low-lying excited states and signiﬁcant orbital
moment, for example, employing a spin Hamiltonian will
provide little insight. As a ﬁnal point, somewhat counter-
intuitively, a more complete incorporation of the under-
lying spin and orbital moment can actually reduce the
overall complexity despite an expansion of the Hilbert
space. The spin symmetry lost in the truncated basis
can often be leveraged by modern computational algo-
rithms to considerable eﬀect.
In this work, we present
a method for deploying point group representations of
spin-symmetry called the molecular symmetry adapted
spin space (mSASS) method. mSASS relies solely on
symmetry constraints. By working in the full spin rota-
tional group and subgroups thereof we are able to main-
tain the meaningful angular momentum operators with
crystal ﬁeld and spin orbit interactions arising via mixing
terms that emerge from the symmetry restrictions.

II. METHOD OVERVIEW

In the following section, we provide theoretical back-
ground outlining the molecular symmetry adapted spin
space approach. To eﬃciently evaluate the symmetry
constraints imposed on the crystal ﬁeld Hamiltonian, we
make use of the Mathematica group theory package GT-
Pack [17, 18]. In particular, we extend the functionality
of GTPack to calculate representation matrices of O(3)
and SU(2), as described throughout the main text and
in the appendix. All examples presented here can be
found in the Mathematica notebook format (Supporting
information).

A. The d1 conﬁguration in an octahedral crystal
ﬁeld

To introduce the methodology, We will build up the
textbook example of a single d-electron in an octahedral,
O, crystal ﬁeld where spin is not a factor outside of the
Pauli exclusion principle. In Section III.B, we will add
detail through the introduction of spinor representations,
constructing the fermionic picture in the presence of si-
multaneous symmetry restrictions of the spin-orbit and
crystal ﬁeld interactions.

Considering only the orbital moment, the ﬁve-fold de-
generate d-electron wave function in O-symmetry splits
according to

Note that we choose O for our analysis of the restric-
tions of the crystal ﬁeld rather than the inversion sym-
metric Oh. The pure rotational octahedral group, O,
provides a more straightforward example, as well as one
of more general utility due to the ready extension to the
tetrahedral case, T .

minor inﬂuence. While the reasons for this are complex
and beyond the scope of this work, in many ways the
triage of spin can be attributed to the search for conﬁg-
uration subspaces accessible by contemporary computa-
tional methods. These subspaces, though vastly reduced
in dimensionality, lack the overarching symmetry restric-
tions of the original space. When applied to systems with
non-trivial spin interactions, the reduced space may still
eﬀectively emulate the properties of the local region of
the full space assuming the subspace remains largely or-
thogonal to the full conﬁguration space (i.e. cases where
interactions arising from spin comprise only very minor
perturbations on the energy). In the framework of (16),

Because of the limitations of the restricted subspace
to minor perturbations, the spin-orbit interaction is typ-
ically discussed in terms of two limits. In the ﬁrst limit,
the spin-orbit interaction dominates the crystal ﬁeld,
causing a splitting of the d-level into two levels with an-
gular momenta j = 3/2 and j = 5/2. These levels then
split in the presence of the crystal ﬁeld. Continuing from
our example of O symmetry, the splitting follows

The corresponding super representation (14) is given by
the Clebsch-Gordan sum

As there are two equivalent representations (F3/2) and
one additional representation (E5/2), we expect four free
parameters in our theory, three determining the three
levels, plus one parameter determining the interaction
between the levels belonging to the equivalent represen-
tation F3/2. Evaluating (13), our algorithm gives the fol-
lowing mSASS Hamiltonian matrix for d1 conﬁgurations

By diagonalizing the matrix, one of the four parameters

The corresponding eigenvectors are parameter dependent
and are expressed as a linear combination of the basis
functions given in (37). As the eigenvectors transform as
irreducible representations retaining the full spinor sym-
metry, they can be used to form a symmetry-restricted
model of the full conﬁguration space as a function of the
full parameter space. Such models can provide useful
insight on the often opaque intermediate conﬁguration
space away from the strong crystal ﬁeld or spin-orbit
limits. Additionally, the use of the symmetry restricted
full conﬁguration space allows for a more physically-
meaningful model for ﬁtting spin-dependent data. This
ﬂows from the fact that a given physical measurement of-
ten represents only a fraction of the energy range needed

If the

model is constructed for the energy range of the mea-
surement instead of the energy range of the physical pa-
rameters, the relationship between the ﬁtted parameters
and the “true” ones is ill-deﬁned and generally not useful
for comparison across diﬀerent systems.

C. Continuous symmetry parameterization of
multielectronic conﬁgurations

In the last example, we provide a simple extension to
the multielectron case: a p4 conﬁguration within an oc-
tahedral ﬁeld. This case extends the coordination chem-
istry examples used so far and serves as a demonstra-
tion of the versatility oﬀered by taking a wider view of
electronic structure problems. Conﬁgurations of several
p-electrons occur e.g., in color centers or vacancies, and
play an important role in d0-magnetism [21, 22] and NV
centers [23–26]. For simplicity, we focus on two electrons
in the p3/2-state, assuming that the p1/2 state is fully oc-
cupied and suﬃciently separated in energy from p3/2. The
corresponding alternating square from Tab. I is

As can be seen, the T2 state corresponds to a spin-triplet
with J = 1, whereas the levels E and A1 give rise to spin
singlets with J = 0. The result is summarized in Fig. 4.

IV. CONCLUSION

Ideally, computational modeling, synthesis, and phys-
ical characterization of spin physics in molecular species
would all fall under an overarching, universal frame-
work robust enough to allow scientists to communicate
through everything from back-of-the-envelope to super-
computer computations.

The molecular symmetry adapted spin space (mSASS)
method allows for a generalization of the crystal ﬁeld the-
ory for calculating atomic spectra, taking into account
the mixing of levels with diﬀerent angular momenta,
when exposed to a symmetry breaking molecular environ-
ment. The mSASS Hamiltonian is constructed by, ﬁrst,
ﬁxing a subspace consisting of several angular momentum
multiplets belonging to a central atom or cluster, and,
second, imposing symmetry constraints of the molecular
environment. We outlined the approach on three simple
examples, the d1 conﬁguration in octahedral and square
symmetry, the d1 conﬁguration in octahedral symmetry
with spin-orbit interaction, and, the p2 conﬁguration in
an octahedral ﬁeld.

By way of introduction, we have provided a case for
the need, theoretical basis, and simple implementation
of the method, leaving detailed exploration of speciﬁc
applications and ﬁtting to experiments for subsequent
work. These works will include, for example, symmetry-
adapted splitting of states in a magnetic ﬁeld.

We close by providing one more advantage of the
mSASS method, compared to conventional crystal ﬁeld
theory. Note, that evaluating (13) is generic. By lifting
the Hermiticity of the mSASS Hamiltonian, the method
can be generalized towards open quantum systems, i.e.,
quantum systems interacting with a thermal bath [27–
29]. In such systems, electrons occupying certain levels
decay in time, which is a natural description for excited
local electrons. A non-Hermitian mSASS Hamiltonian
contains the respective decay channels in terms of gen-

The eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian in terms of the re-
spective two-electron basis functions are given by

culating the SU (2) and SO(3) representation matrices.
We follow the approach derived by Altmann [31]. Note
that the SU (2) matrices represent the j = 1/2 represen-
tation of SU (2). We obtain all other representations by
constructing corresponding tensor products as described
below. As SU (2) is the double cover of SO(3), all SO(3)
representations are obtained in terms of integer valued
j. The j = 1/2 representation is spanned by two basis

[20] We note that a Hermitian matrix was historically cho-
sen to enforce real eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. This
condition can be lifted towards PT -symmetric matrices
[35] which bring a new twist to quantum chemistry. Also,
non-Hermitian matrices are meaningful, in the context of
open quantum systems [29].
