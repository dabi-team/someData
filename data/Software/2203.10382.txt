Abstract

The omnipresent nature of mobile applications (apps) in all aspects of daily lives
raises the necessity of reﬂecting end-users’ values (e.g., fairness, honesty, social recog-
nition, etc.) in apps. However, there are limited considerations of end-users’ values in
apps development. Value violations by apps have been reported in the media and are
responsible for end-users’ dissatisfaction and negative socio-economic consequences.
Value violations may bring more severe and lasting problems for marginalized and
vulnerable end-users of apps, which have been explored less (if at all) in the soft-
ware engineering community. One of the main reasons behind value violations is
the lack of understanding of human values due to their ill-deﬁned, ambiguous, and
implicit nature. Therefore, understanding the values of the end-users of apps is the
essential ﬁrst step towards values-based apps development. This research aims to
ﬁll this gap by investigating the human values of Bangladeshi female farmers as a
marginalized and vulnerable group of end-users of Bangladeshi agriculture apps. We
conducted an empirical study that collected and analyzed data from a survey with
193 Bangladeshi female farmers, the end-users of Bangladeshi agriculture apps, to
explore the underlying factor structure of Bangladeshi female farmers’ values and

lying factors of Bangladeshi female farmers. The ﬁrst factor comprises of ﬁve values:
benevolence, security, conformity, universalism, and tradition. The second factor
consists of two values: self-direction and stimulation. The third factor includes three
values: power, achievement, and hedonism. We also identiﬁed strong inﬂuences of
demographics on some of the values of Bangladeshi female farmers. For example,
area has signiﬁcant impacts on three values: hedonism, achievement, and tradition.
Similarly, there are also strong inﬂuences of household income on power and secu-
rity. The results provide a direction for app developers on which values they should
consider while developing agriculture apps for Bangladeshi female farmers.

1. Introduction

Software is ubiquitous in daily lives which raises the necessity to consider end-
users’ human values such as transparency, accessibility, freedom, independence, fair-
ness, and tradition in software. Human values are deﬁned as “desirable, trans-
situational goals, varying in importance, that serve as guiding principles in people’s
lives” [1]. Some recent studies focused on human values in software engineering (SE).
For example, Mougouei et al. proposed a research roadmap to consider human val-
ues in software [2]. Obie et al. proposed an automated technique using a natural
language processing approach to detect values violations reported in app reviews [3].
Another research conducted two case studies to identify the practices and challenges
of addressing human values in SE [4]. A recent study proposed ﬁve intervention
points in the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) where human values can be addressed
[5]. In addition, some techniques have been proposed to consider human values in
software development. They are Value-Based Requirements Engineering (VBRE) [6],
Value-Sensitive Design (VSD) [7], Value-Sensitive Software Development (VSSD) [8],
Values-First SE [9], and Values Q-sort [10].

Despite these eﬀorts, SE research and practices have limited considerations of
human values in software [2]. A recent study shows that only 16% of 1350 pa-
pers published between 2015 and 2018 in top-tier SE journals and conferences were
directly relevant to human values [11]. There are also many examples of value vi-
olations in software. For example, Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica to use
50 million Facebook users’ personal data to gain a political advantage without the
consent of the users [12]. Therefore, this incident violated Facebook users’ values
such as privacy and trust. Similarly, Instagram was blamed for the suicide of a

2

British teenager because the recommendation algorithm of Instagram recommended
self-harming images like any other interests such as sports or music in her newsfeed
[13]. This incident arguably violated society’s values such as preservation of life.
Value violations in software are more destructive if the end-users are vulnerable and
marginalized women in conservative societies. They usually face many social and
cultural challenges which might be ampliﬁed because of value violations in the soft-
ware they use [14]. For example, recent value violations occurred in 61% (22 out of
36 apps) of menstruation apps, where they shared users’ incredibly personal details
with Facebook without the users’ consent [15, 16]. This privacy breach is a threat
to the women’s mental health and might have destructive impacts on their families
and social lives. Therefore, addressing end-users’ values in software is essential. It
is more important for mobile software applications (apps) as with the growing num-
ber of smartphones, many organizations have been providing their products through
apps. Apps are rich and complex [17], causing more usability and utility problems
[18] than other software. Therefore, addressing end-users’ values in apps is also dif-
ferent from other software. However, there is little research on human values in apps
from the perspective of vulnerable and underrepresented end-users (e.g., women in
developing countries) [19].

It is argued that the essential ﬁrst step towards developing end-users’ values-
based apps is understanding the values of the end-users [19]. However, because of
the ill-deﬁned nature of human values, they are diﬃcult to capture and express [11].
As a result, there is a lack of understanding of human values [11]. To address this
issue, we conducted an empirical study that explored the values of Bangladeshi fe-
male farmers, vulnerable and underrepresented end-users of Bangladeshi agriculture
apps. This study collected and analyzed data from a survey with 193 Bangladeshi
female farmers. In one of our previous studies, we identiﬁed the value priorities of
Bangladeshi female farmers and explored how their value priorities diﬀer demograph-
ically [19]. In this study, we investigated the possible underlying factor structure of
Bangladeshi female farmers’ values to explore whether there are diﬀerent groups of
Bangladeshi female farmers with similar values. We also investigated the signiﬁcance
of the demographics on their values. Our ﬁndings indicate:

• Three (3) underlying factors of Bangladeshi female farmers’ values. Factor1
consists of ﬁve values, Factor2 consists of two values, and Factor3 includes
three values. For example, Factor2 comprises of self-direction and stimulation.

• Strong inﬂuences of two demographic groups (area and household income) on

ﬁve values: hedonism, achievement, tradition, power, and security.

2. Background and Related Work

2.1. Human Values and Values Theory

Social scientists have been conducting research to deﬁne and conceptualize human
values since 1931 [20]. Rokeach deﬁned Human values as “a belief that a particular
way of doing something is personally or socially preferable to the opposite ways”
[21]. Later, Shalom H. Schwartz gave a simpler deﬁnition of human values as “things
that people hold important in their life” [22]. A recent work has summarized seven
diﬀerent deﬁnitions of human values as “guiding principles of what people consider
important in life” [23]. Values are intertwined with feelings [22], and therefore,
respect for values would bring enjoyment for an individual while relative importance
for each value may diﬀer for each person [21, 22, 24]. Moreover, values have been
used to identify personality and to understand what is and is not important in life
[25].

Social scientists have been conducting research to conceptualize human values
since 1931 [20]. Allport and Vernon proposed the ﬁrst values theory in 1931 on
personality typology [26]. Expanding their theory, Allport et al. classiﬁed values into
six categories: theoretical, economic, aesthetic, social, political, and religious [25] in
1960. A few years later, Rokeach conducted a series of surveys with people from
diﬀerent ethnic and social backgrounds and proposed 36 values, where he claimed
them as universal values [21]. In 1980, Hofstede introduced two values categories,
namely, desired and desirable i.e., what people actually desire and what they think
ought to be desired respectively [27]. In 1992, Shalom H. Schwartz proposed a values
theory that identiﬁed ten (10) human values deﬁned by their motivational goals and
measured from 58 value items [28]. In 2004, Parashar et al. divided values into two
concepts, namely, individual behavior (micro values) and cultural practices (macro
values) [29]. In 2008, Inglehart identiﬁed two dimensions of values according to the
cross-cultural variations as post-materialist and self-expression values [30]. In 2010,
a meta-inventory of human values was introduced by analyzing 12 value inventories
[23]. The most recent values model was introduced in 2014 by Gouveia et al., in
which six basic value categories were identiﬁed (existence values, promotion values,
normative values, suprapersonal values, excitement values, and interactive values)
[31].

4

In this study, we used Schwartz’s theory of basic human values to explore Bangladeshi

female farmers’ values. Schwartz’s values theory is recognised as the most cited, most
comprehensive and widely adopted values theory to date [6, 32] in social science along
with other areas such as computer science [33] and software engineering [32]. More-
over, this theory has been tested in diﬀerent settings with variations according to
geography, culture, language, religion, politics, age, education, and gender [34, 28].
In this theory, Schwartz divided values into ten main categories (self-direction, stim-
ulation, hedonism, achievement, power, security, conformity, tradition, benevolence,
and universalism) based on their motivational goals. These main value categories
are measured from 58 value items. Values located close to each other are congruent
and those further apart are opposite in nature [28, 22]. Figure 1 shows Schwartz’s
theoretical model of basic human values of ten main value categories with the corre-
sponding value items to measure those main value categories [28].

2.2. Value Measurement Instrument

Schwartz proposed the following two types of instruments to measure human

values suitable for all cross-cultural settings.

2.2.1. Schwartz Value Survey (SVS)

The ﬁrst instrument to measure human values developed by Schwartz is Schwartz
Value Survey (SVS) [22]. Based on the basic values theory of Schwartz, this survey
presents two lists with 30 value items and 27 value items respectively (see the 57
SVS items in [36]) to the participants to describe potentially desirable end-states
and potentially desirable ways of acting [22]. Each value item demonstrates the mo-
tivational goal of the corresponding value. Each item contains an explanatory state-
ment in parentheses that clariﬁes the meaning of that value item [22]. For example,
the item, ‘equality (equal opportunity for all)’ refers to the main value universalism.
Similarly, ‘authority (the right to lead or command)’ is a value item of power. The
participants are then asked to respond to each value item as a guiding principle in
their lives on a 9-point scale: 7 (of supreme importance), 6 (very important), 5 (unla-
beled), 4 (unlabeled), 3 (important), 2 (unlabeled), 1 (unlabeled), 0 (not important),
-1 (opposed to my values). The score of each value item is calculated by the average
rating of that item given by all the participants [22].

2.2.2. Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ)

According to Schwartz, the alternative instrument to measure human values is
Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ). In PVQ, there are short text descriptions
(portraits) of characteristics that reﬂect a person’s goals, aspirations, and wishes
leading to a particular value [22]. For example, the portrait, “It’s very important to
her to help the people around her. She wants to care for their well-being” describes a
person for whom ‘benevolence’ is an important value. Based on “How much like you
is this person?”, the participants are asked to rate each portrait on a 6-point scale:
6 (Very much like me), 5 (Like me), 4 (Somewhat like me), 3 (A little like me), 2
(Not like me) and 1 (Not like me at all) [34].

PVQ is easy to understand as it is less abstract, more concrete, more context-
bound, and less complicated than the SVS [34]. Therefore, PVQ is suitable for
less-educated people [37] like Bangladeshi female farmers. 68% of Bangladeshi farm-
ers’ education level is less than Year 10, and 25% have no education at all [38].
Furthermore, the female literacy rate is lower than the male in Bangladesh [39].
Therefore, we selected PVQ as the value measurement instrument to explore the
values of Bangladeshi female farmers.

There are several versions of PVQ. In 2001, Schwartz introduced 40 items PVQ
(PVQ-40) [40], which has been shortened to 21 items (PVQ-21) in 2002 to include

6

in the semiannual European Social Survey (ESS) [41, 42]. Schwartz also developed
20 items and 29 items PVQ [40]. Furthermore, Bubeck and Bilsky developed 29
items PVQ in 2002 [43], and Knoppen and Saris developed 33 items PVQ in 2009
[37]. This research used 40 items PVQ because it is more suitable for cross-cultural
research [41]. It is also argued that 40 items PVQ may lead to more accurate results
as it is more elaborate and contains more items in each value [41].

2.3. Advanced Statistical Methods to Elicit Human Values

Advanced statistical methods such as factor analysis are used in a few research to
elicit human values. For example, Schwartz applied factor analysis to elicit the ten
main value categories distinguished by their motivational goals [44]. Later, Schwartz
et al. conﬁrmed his proposed ten main value categories by applying conﬁrmatory fac-
tor analysis on 10,857 samples from 27 countries [45]. Another study applied factor
analysis on a survey data to explore the values of Chinese students around the world
and their relations with culture [46]. Braithwaite and Law adopted factor analysis
on the collected dataset to examine the adequacy of Rokeach value survey in terms
of comprehensive coverage of the value domain [47]. Allen conducted regression and
factor analysis to investigate the inﬂuences of human values on consumer purchase
decisions [48]. Therefore, advanced statistical analysis can be considered as a com-
prehensive approach to elicit human values which we used to investigate the factor
structure of Bangladeshi female farmers’ values and the signiﬁcance of demographics
on their values.

2.4. Prevalence of Human Values in Software Engineering

Recently, a few studies have focused on human values in software engineering
(SE) contexts. For example, the importance of considering human values in software
engineering was described by Mougouei et al, where they also identiﬁed the research
gap of eliciting human values [2]. Ferrario et al. proposed a framework to consider
values during SE decision making processes [9]. Another study investigated values
at the system, personal, and instantiation levels of SE by proposing a value mea-
surement tool named Values Q-Sort [10]. A recent study introduced a framework
to integrate, trace, and evaluate human values throughout the software development
life cycle (SDLC) [49]. Thew and Sutcliﬀe complemented the existing analysis of
non-functional requirements by eliciting stakeholders’ values through their proposed
approach named Values Based Requirement Engineering (VBRE) [6]. Another study
introduced a framework values-based implications of software design patterns [50].
Aldewereld et al. translated values into more concrete features during software devel-
opment by introducing a design for values approach named Value-Sensitive Software
Development (VSSD) [8].

7

Despite the emerging concerns of human values in software engineering, only 16%
papers of top-tier SE journals and conferences from 2015-2018 were directly relevant
to human values. Furthermore, in one of our studies with Bangladeshi agriculture
apps, we identiﬁed almost 50% of the end-users’ values are ignored/violated in those
apps [51]. Therefore, we argue that there is a room for development in addressing
human values in software engineering. We also argue that eliciting end-users’ values
should be the ﬁrst step towards this goal as eliciting human values is necessary to
develop value requirements for the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) [19].

2.5. Bangladesh, Women in Agriculture and Smartphones

Bangladesh is an agriculture-dependent country due to the geographical setting
[52]. In Bangladesh, agriculture contributes 14.23% of GDP in 2019 [52]. Agriculture
is the only source of earning for more than 80% people in Bangladesh [53]. 38% of
the labor force are involved in the agricultural sector (2019) [54]. Nowadays, women
are also participating in agricultural activities, resulting in the “feminization of agri-
culture” [55]. Bangladeshi women, less than 20% of the agricultural labour force,
started participating in agricultural activities in 1999/2000 [56]. Their participation
was increased to 33.6% in 2010 [56], more than 50% in 2016 [57], and 58% in 2019
[58].

Mobile phones play an important role in agriculture as they provide the op-
portunity for farmers to access information regarding agricultural initiatives [59].
According to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC),
there are 181.53 million mobile phone subscribers in Bangladesh till November 2021
[60]. As the population of Bangladesh is more than 164 million (2020) [61], it can
be assumed that almost all people use mobile phones and some people use more
than one mobile phone. The statistics by BTRC in October 2021 also show that the
total number of Internet subscribers in Bangladesh is 129.18 million [62]. Moreover,
there is a potential future prospect of the smartphones market in Bangladesh as the
number of smartphone users has been radically increasing in Bangladesh because
of the availability and low price of smartphones [63, 64]. As smartphones are easily
accessible, the majority of Internet subscribers use the Internet via smartphones [65].
With the increase of the use of the Internet, mobile apps have become increasingly
popular.

Agriculture mobile apps play an important role in agriculture development, re-
sulting the popularity of agriculture apps in recent years. 35 Bangladeshi agriculture
apps are available in Google play (2018) [51] which are used by the stakeholders
in agriculture, including farmers [66, 19]. Bangladeshi farmers used these apps to
know about weather forecast which help them taking precautions [52]. In addition,

8

information such as agricultural problem solving, detecting diseases, ﬁnding disease
solutions, and using the recommended medicines [67, 68] are also available in those
apps which are useful for the farmers.

There are a few studies on Bangladeshi agriculture apps. For example, Chowhan
and Ghosh explained the role of mobile apps on Bangladesh agriculture and its future
scope [52]. Sharma conducted a case study of agriculture apps in Bangladesh and
India to explore the importance of agriculture mobile apps in farmers’ empowerment
[69]. Another study identiﬁed the techniques suitable to develop agriculture apps in
local languages to identify diseases and management of maize crop in Bangladesh
[67]. However, we did not identify any published research on Bangladeshi farmers’
values in agriculture apps other than our works. One of our papers identiﬁed the
value priorities of Bangladeshi female farmers [19]. In our another paper, the present
and missing values of the users of Bangladeshi agriculture apps were explored by
analyzing user reviews [51]. Our other study determined the extent to which the
existing Bangladeshi agriculture apps reﬂect Bangladeshi female farmers’ values and
identiﬁed the strategies to address their values in apps from both the end-users’
and app practitioners’ perspectives [70]. In this research, we explored the possible
underlying factor structure of Bangladeshi female farmers’ values and the signiﬁcance
of the demographics on their values.

3. Methodology

This research is funded by an Information and Communication Technology for
Development (ICT4D) project named PROTIC (Participatory Research and Own-
ership with Technology, Information and Change) of a multinational charitable or-
ganization, Oxfam Bangladesh, in collaboration with Monash university. PROTIC
works for the resilience of Bangladeshi female farmers through the use of ICT [59].
This study aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the values of Bangladeshi
female farmers to help apps developers develop Bangladeshi female farmers’ values-
based agriculture mobile apps. With this goal, we formulated the following two
research questions.
RQ1. What is the possible underlying factor structure of Bangladeshi female farm-
ers’ values?
RQ2. How much inﬂuence do the demographics have on the values of Bangladeshi
female farmers?

To answer the research questions, we conducted an empirical study where we col-
lected data through a survey with 193 Bangladeshi female farmers. The survey data
was previously used to identify the value priorities of Bangladeshi female farmers and

9

Figure 2: An overview of the research method

how their value priorities diﬀer demographically by applying descriptive statistical
methods on the data [19]. This research used the same survey data from diﬀer-
ent perspectives to answer the research questions using advanced statistical analysis
(factor analysis and multiple regression analysis). Figure 2 shows an overview of the
research method of this study. Before we conducted this study, ethics approval was
acquired from Monash university Human Research Ethics Committee (MUHREC)
on 21/11/2019.

3.1. Protocol

We conducted a paper-based survey with 193 Bangladeshi female farmers who
use agriculture mobile apps in their daily agricultural activities. The survey was
conducted in December 2019 at their villages. The participants felt comfortable as
the survey was conducted in their natural setting. It took 9 days to complete the
survey with 193 participants. Figure 3 shows a picture of conducting the survey.

The survey was divided into three parts. The ﬁrst part worked as an ice-breaker
session where we spent approximately 15 minutes having a friendly chat with the
female farmers to put them at their ease.
In the second part, the research was
explained to the participants along with its objectives, expected outcomes, and con-
ﬁdential data storage. They were also provided with an explanatory statement of

this research and the consent form. In this part, the participants were provided with
proper guidance on how to complete the survey. The last part was the survey which
took approximately 15 minutes to complete.

In this survey, we used a value measurement tool named Portrait Values Question-
naire (PVQ) proposed by Schwartz [40] to identify the values of the female farmers.
Each portrait (i.e., item) in PVQ describes a person’s characteristic that reﬂects the
importance of a particular value. For example, a portrait, “Thinking up new ideas
and being creative is important to her. She likes to do things in her own original
way” describes a person for whom Self-direction is an important value. The par-
ticipants were then asked to compare themselves with each portrait and rate on a
6-point Likert scale: 6 (Very much like me), 5 (Like me), 4 (Somewhat like me), 3
(A little like me), 2 (Not like me) and 1 (Not like me at all) [34]. In our survey, there
were 40 portraits (i.e., items) to understand the values of Bangladeshi female farmers
[40] (see the survey questionnaire [71]). We also collected demographic data from
the participants through six questions. For example, “which area are you from?”,
“which age group do you belong to?”, “what is the highest degree or level of school
you have completed? If currently enrolled, highest degree received?” etc. (see the
demographic questions [71]).

Although the PVQ questionnaire has been translated in diﬀerent languages (even
in local languages such as Afrikaans [34]) and conducted in various countries [72], we
found that the questionnaire has no Bengali version and PVQ was never conducted
in Bangladesh. Therefore, we translated the PVQ questionnaire from English to

11

Figure 4: Demographics of the survey participants

of the PVQ questionnaire. At ﬁrst, the PVQ questionnaire was translated from
English to Bengali by the ﬁrst author of this paper who is Bangladeshi. Then, the
independent translator translated the Bengali version back to English. After that,
we compared the back-translated version with the original version of PVQ and found
some inconsistencies. Then, the ﬁrst author translated the questionnaire to Bengali
again to solve these issues. The independent translator again back-translated the
Bengali version of PVQ to English. After comparing this version with the original
one, we hardly found any inconsistencies. Therefore, we used this Bengali version
of PVQ in our survey. The collected data were transferred to an Excel sheet and
SPSS, stored in Google Drive for the data analysis. This ﬁle was shared with all
the authors of this paper. We ensured the conﬁdentiality of the paper-based data by
storing it in a locked cabinet at our lab in Monash university.

3.2. Participants

The main criterion for selecting the survey participants was to ﬁnd Bangladeshi
female farmers who use agriculture apps in their daily farming activities. Oxfam
Bangladesh helped us select the participants. Oxfam provided smartphones to 100
female farmers from the Northern part (Sandy area [73]) and 100 from the South-
ern part (Coastal area [74]) of Bangladesh, as well as trained them on how to use
smartphones and diﬀerent agriculture mobile apps. As our selection criterion was
precisely similar to those 200 female farmers, we recruited them as the survey partic-
ipants. Seven women were unavailable during the survey, so we collected data from
193 participants.

Survey Participants Characteristics. Figure 4 shows the corresponding num-

bers of survey participants in each demographic group.

3.3. Data Analysis

We analyzed the survey data by following the seven steps as described below.
Step 1: Data Pre-processing. At ﬁrst, the paper-based survey data was
transferred to SPSS software [75]. We transferred the participants’ responses as well
as their demographic data but we did not transfer their names so that their identity
can remain protected.

We also found missing responses for a few questions and some multiple responses
for a particular question. We considered the multiple responses as missing responses
[76] and after that, we found 275 (3.56%) missing responses out of 7720 responses.
We used multiple imputation technique in SPSS to replace the missing values with
plausible responses [77], as multiple imputation technique reduces the risk of wrong
estimations due to reduced sample size and increases the statistical power [76].

13

Step 2: Measurement Reliability Test. It was essential to examine the reli-
ability of our value measurement tool, PVQ, because a measurement tool is not valid
unless it is reliable [78]. Measurement reliability is used to examine the consistency
of responses to a set of items that emerge a concept [79]. Cronbach’s alpha is one of
the most widely used techniques to measure the reliability in the social and organiza-
tional sciences [80]. Cronbach’s alpha describes the extent to which the responses are
correlated to each other [79]. We applied Cronbach’s alpha using the SPSS software
to measure the consistency of the responses of the items under each value category
(e.g., consistency of the four responses under the value category of Benevolence, six
responses under Universalism). The formula of Cronbach’s alpha is [81]:

N 2(

M ean(Cov)
Sum(V ar/Cov)

)

Here, N is the number of items in the scale, Mean(Cov) is the mean of inter-
item covariance, and Sum(Var/Cov) is the sum of all the elements in the variance-
covariance matrix [81].

Step 3: Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis on Individual Value Items. Con-
ﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is a statistical method that deals with measurement
models to explore the factors of a set of observed variables [82, 83]. In other words,
CFA tests a hypothesis of the relationship between manifest variables (observed vari-
ables) and latent variables (unobserved variables) statistically [82]. Therefore, we
applied CFA on our survey data to check if the data are aligned with the hypothesis
developed by Schwartz regarding which particular items are used to measure a value
(e.g., 4 items were used to measure Benevolence, 6 items to measure Universalism).
We used IBM SPSS AMOS 26 to conduct the CFA with the 40 items to test the
relations between the manifest variables (e.g., 40 individual value items) and the
latent variables or factors.

Step 4: Exploratory Factor Analysis on Main Value Categories. Ex-
ploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is a variable reduction statistical technique that
explores the possible underlying factor structure of a set of observed variables [82].
Therefore, to identify the possible factors from the 10 main value categories, we con-
ducted EFA with principal component extraction and varimax rotation using IBM
SPSS 26. At this stage, the 10 main value categories were calculated by averaging
the items under each category (e.g., average of the 4 items to calculate Benevolence,
average of the 6 items to calculate Universalism). Later, we applied the EFA on
these 10 value categories which worked as observed variables during the EFA. The
decision on how many factors should be considered depends on the eigenvalues of
each factor [84]. According to the suggestions of Guttman, Kaiser’s criterion retains

14

factors with eigenvalue greater than 1 [82]. Therefore, in this study, we also followed
the criterion and considered the factors whose eigenvalues are greater than 1.

Step 5: Partial Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis on Main Value Cate-
gories. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) suggests that research should conduct
Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to conﬁrm the factors derived from the EFA
[85]. Before proceeding to CFA, it is a good practice to conduct Partial Conﬁrmatory
Factor Analysis (PCFA) which is a data reduction technique that lies between EFA
and CFA to understand whether CFA is justiﬁable and whether the factors derived
from the EFA have a strong chance of getting conﬁrmed by the CFA [85]. Therefore,
we have conducted PCFA using IBM SPSS 26 and Excel to test if the EFA results are
good ﬁt for CFA. For this purpose, we have used four close-ﬁt indexes [85]: Normed
Fit Index (NFI) [86], Comparative Fit Index (CFI) [87], Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI)
[88], Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) [89].

[85].

Step 6: Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis on Main Value Categories. To
conﬁrm the relations between the manifest variables (10 main value categories) and
the latent variables or factors derived from the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA),
we conducted Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) on the 10 main value categories
by using IBM SPSS AMOS 26.

Step 7: Multiple Linear Regression Analysis on Values with Demo-
graphics. We conducted a multiple linear regression analysis to check the signif-
icance of demographics (area, age, education level, household income, number of

15

educated family members, highest level of education among family members) on val-
ues (e.g., Benevolence, Universalism, Self-direction etc.). Multiple linear regression
is a linear regression model which explores the relationship between one dependent
variable and multiple independent variables [90]. Therefore, we conducted the multi-
ple linear regression analysis ten times using IBM SPSS 26 to check the signiﬁcance
of the demographics (independent variables) on the ten main value categories (de-
pendent variables).

4. Results

This section presents the results of the survey with 193 Bangladeshi female farm-

ers.

4.1. RQ1: Factor Structure of Bangladeshi Female Farmers’ Values

After the data pre-processing, we applied the following ﬁve steps of statistical
analysis on the survey data to explore the factor structure of Bangladeshi female
farmers’ values (RQ1). The results of these ﬁve steps are discussed below.

4.1.1. Measurement Reliability Test

As mentioned in Subsection 3.3, we calculated Cronbach’s alpha to measure the
reliability of our survey data and to test the internal consistency of the attributes.
Therefore, we tested the 40 attributes within the 10 latent variables (Benevolence,
Universalism, Self-direction, Stimulation, Hedonism, Achievement, Power, Security,
Conformity, and Tradition) using the data from the 193 participants. Table 1 shows
the results of the measurement reliability test.

We referred the attributes as “variableN”. For example, the four attributes under
the latent variable, benevolence are referred as benevolence1, benevolence2, benev-
olence3, and benevolence4 ). The 10 latent variables (main value categories), their
corresponding attributes (value items) with the referred names are shown in [71]. Al-
though there are many controversies with the acceptable range of Cronbach’s alpha,
the usual interpretation of the coeﬃcient, α is [91]:

α < 0.5 = Low Reliability

0.5 < α < 0.8 = Acceptable Reliability

α > 0.8 = High Reliability

According to the results shown in Table 1, the cronbach’s alpha ranged from
0.54 to 0.75 for the ten latent variables. Therefore, all of them were considered

acceptable. The obtained reliability measures thus increased the conﬁdence in the
contribution of the 40 attributes to the measurement of their respective 10 latent
variables. The results of the Cronbach’s alpha (if item deleted) did not indicate
that any of the items should be removed for benevolence, universalism, self-direction,
achievement, security, conformity, and tradition. For stimulation, hedonism, and
power, Cronbach’s alpha could be slightly increased if one item is removed. However,
we did not remove any items as the Cronbach’s alpha for these variables were already
in the acceptable range. These ﬁndings provided justiﬁcation for considering all of
the items associated with a particular value.

4.1.2. Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis on Individual Value Items

As a preparation for exploring the factor structure of Bangladeshi female farmers’
values, Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted on the 40 value items
from the survey (PVQ) data using the software, IBM SPSS AMOS 26 (details in
step 3 of Subsection 3.3). It was conducted to check if the survey data is aligned
with Schwartz’s theory of basic human values by observing the relations between
the manifest variables or observed variables (40 value items) and latent variables or
factors. Figure 5 shows the results of CFA on the 40 value items of the survey data
with Bangladeshi female farmers.

The latent and manifest variables are shown in ellipse and rectangle shapes re-
spectively. As mentioned in Subsection 4.1.1, we refer the value items (manifest
variables) as “variableN” under a main value category (latent variable) for the con-
venience of the readers [71]. The unidirectional arrows from the factors to the man-
ifest variables show the direct eﬀects (regressions) of the latent variables onto the
observed variables. The weights on the unidirectional arrows refer to the factor load-
ings or regression coeﬃcients. The curved, bidirectional arrows show the covariances
(correlations) among the factors. The term, “e” refers to the error terms.

According to Figure 5, the cross-loadings are zero, because no indicator (manifest
variable) loads on more than one factors. 10 latent variables or factors are extracted
from the 40 manifest variables. Four manifest variables of benevolence (benevolence1,
benevolence2, benevolence3, benevolence4 ) together produce one factor which we also
named benevolence. Similarly, one factor is extracted from each of the groups of six
universalism manifest variables, four self-direction manifest variables, three stimu-
lation manifest variables, three hedonism manifest variables, four achievement man-
ifest variables, three power manifest variables, ﬁve security manifest variables, four
conformity manifest variables, and four tradition manifest variables. As all the man-
ifest variables of a particular value together extract one factor and it happened for all
the 40 value items to extract 10 factors, we argue that the survey data we collected

18

Figure 5: Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) model on 40 value items: Relations of manifest and
latent variables

19

 from 193 Bangladeshi female farmers are matched with Schwartz’s values theory and
good ﬁt for further advanced statistical analysis.

Furthermore, there are also 40 error variances and one error covariance, which
means all the error covariances are zero except for the error covariance between
tradition3 and tradition4. Another acceptability test of a CFA model is the goodness
of ﬁt. Goodness of ﬁt can be evaluated by calculating the p-value, CMIN (chi-
square value), and RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation) [83]. In
this CFA model, p-value is .000 (recommended level: <0.001 [92]), CMIN is 2.782
(recommended level: <3.00 [93]), and RMSEA is .085 (recommended level: <0.10
[94]). Given that the p-value, CMIN, and RMSEA are in recommended levels, the
CFA model is accepted. In addition, all the factor loadings are in acceptable levels
(>0.32 [95]) except for the manifest variable, hedonism2. The manifest variables
responsible for the lower factor loadings are recommended to remove to develop
a better CFA model. However, removing items is not recommended if any value
consists of equal or less than three items. As hedonism consists of three items, we
did not remove hedonism2. However, there are strong correlations among the factors
which also make the CFA model acceptable for further analysis.

4.1.3. Exploratory Factor Analysis on Main Value Categories

From the previous step of CFA on value items, ten factors or latent variables
(main value categories) were detected. We applied Exploratory Factor Analysis
(EFA) on the ten main value categories to explore the possible factors underlying
the main value categories. At ﬁrst, the suitability of the data was veriﬁed, and then
the factors were extracted.

The ﬁrst step of EFA is the assessment of the suitability of the data [96, 97].
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) was used to verify the sampling adequacy [98] and
Bartlett’s test of sphericity was used to assess the strength of the inter-correlations

20

among variables [99] using IBM SPSS 26. Table 2 shows the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
(KMO) and Barlett’s test results. The KMO presents the suitability of the sam-
pling of this analysis which is 0.815. The KMO score of sampling appropriateness
is signiﬁcant as the KMO should be greater than 0.6 for sampling adequacy [100].
According to the table, Bartlett’s test of sphericity is also acceptable with p-value
0.000 (recommended p-value is <0.001 [101]).

Extraction of the Factors.

Figure 6: Scree plot

Factor extraction is used to identify the least number of factors to represent
the interrelationship among the variables [97]. We conducted EFA with principal
component extraction to extract the factors, where the main value categories worked
as observed variables. Table 3 shows the total variance. The components whose
eigenvalues are greater than one (1.0) are considered in this study as Kaiser’s criterion
retains factors with eigenvalue greater than one [82]. According to the table, three
components or factors are greater than eigenvalues one which explained 69.464% of
the variance of the factors. 50% is the suggested proportion of the total variance
explained by the retained factors [97]. Therefore, the result is considered acceptable
and the factor analysis is considered useful for the variables. The ﬁrst factor explained
31.648% of the total variance with eigenvalue 4.478. The second factor explained
21.347% of the variance with eigenvalue 1.444 and the third factor explained 16.469%
of the total variance with eigenvalue 1.025. Figure 6 shows the scree plot, a graphical
representation, of the three factors with eigenvalues greater than one. The vertical

Extraction Method: Principal Component Analysis

axis represents the eigenvalue magnitudes and the horizontal axis represents the
component number.

We also applied varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization as an orthogonal
factor rotation technique using IBM SPSS 26 to explore which variables constitute
the three factors or components. Table 4 shows the rotated component matrix on
which the interpretation of factors resulting from the EFA is established. Principal
component analysis was undertaken as the extraction method. The rotation con-
verged in ﬁve iterations and three factors emerged from the main value categories.
The ﬁrst factor includes ﬁve items (main value categories). They are benevolence,
security, conformity, universalism, and tradition. The second factor consists of two
items: self-direction and stimulation. The third factor includes the rest of the three
items: power, achievement, and hedonism. According to Kozan et al., the loadings
of the items are signiﬁcant if they are greater than 0.32 [95]. In this study, items
load strongly on the ﬁrst factor ranging from 0.573 to 0.858. Similarly, items load
signiﬁcantly on the second factor ranging from 0.727 to 0.859 and on the third factor
ranging from 0.634 to 0.790. As all the item loadings on the three factors are ex-
tremely strong, it gave us the conﬁdence to apply CFA on the main value categories
to verify the factors extracted from EFA.

4.1.4. Partial Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis on Main Value Categories

We conducted Partial Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (PCFA), the data reduction
technique, to test if the factors extracted from EFA have a solid chance of getting
conﬁrmed by CFA. We used IBM SPSS 26 and Excel to conduct PCFA. Table 5
shows the results of PCFA for the four close-ﬁt indexes: Normed Fit Index (NFI),
Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Root Mean Square Error
of Approximation (RMSEA) with their corresponding recommended levels.

The table shows that the NFI, CFI, and RMSEA are at acceptable levels. How-
ever, TLI is slightly lower than the recommended level. As the other three close-ﬁt
indexes are in the accepted range and TLI is close to the recommended level, we
argue that the factors extracted from EFA have a high chance of getting conﬁrmed
by CFA. Therefore, conducting CFA is justiﬁed.

4.1.5. Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis on Main Value Categories

We conducted Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) on the ten main value cate-
gories using IBM SPSS AMOS 26 to verify the relations between the 10 main value
categories (manifest variables) and the factors or components (latent variables) de-
rived from the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). Figure 7 shows the results of CFA
on the main value categories of the survey conducted with Bangladeshi female farm-
ers. The factors and the main value categories are shown in the ellipse and rectangle

shapes respectively. The model extracted three factors. The ﬁrst factor (Factor1)
consists of ﬁve manifest variables (main value categories). They are, benevolence, se-
curity, conformity, universalism, and tradition. The second factor (Factor2) includes
two variables: self-direction and stimulation. The third factor (Factor3) consists of
three variables: power, achievement, and hedonism. The result is exactly similar to
the result of EFA (see Table 4) discussed in Subsection 4.1.3.

Figure 7: Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) model on 10 main value categories: Extraction of
factors

As shown in Figure 7, no variable loads on more than one factors. Hence, the
cross-loadings of CFA are zero. Furthermore, there are ten error variances with zero
error covariances. Therefore, the CFA model is considered acceptable. In addition,
all the factor loadings in this model are in the acceptable range of equal or above
0.32 [95] except for the factor loading of power. As the factor loading for power is

25

0.31 which is close to 0.32, power was not removed from the CFA model. However,
the inter-correlations among the factors (latent variables) should be below 0.85 to
conﬁrm the CFA model [104]. As shown in Figure 7, the model also supports this
condition, where all the correlations among factors are below 0.85. They are 0.50
between Factor1 and Factor3, 0.74 between Factor1 and Factor2, and 0.52 between
Factor2 and Factor3. Further goodness of ﬁt evaluation was conducted in Subsection
4.1.4 which also enhances the acceptability of this model.

4.2. RQ2: Inﬂuence of Demographics on the Values of Bangladeshi Female Farmers
As described in Section 3.1, six demographic data (area, age, education level,
household income, number of educated family members, highest level of education
among family members) of Bangladeshi female farmers were collected during the
survey. One of our paper discussed how value priorities of Bangladeshi female farm-
ers diﬀer demographically through descriptive statistical analysis [19]. This section
presents the signiﬁcance of demographics (independent variables) on the main value
categories of Bangladeshi female farmers (dependent variables). For this purpose, we
conducted an advanced statistical method, multiple linear regression method, using
IBM SPSS 26. Table 6 shows the result of the inﬂuence of demographics on the
values of Bangladeshi female farmers.

There are strong signiﬁcance of independent variables on dependent variables if
the p-value (signiﬁcance) is less than 0.01, moderate signiﬁcance if the p-value is
greater than or equal to 0.01 and less than 0.05, weak signiﬁcance if the p-value is
greater than or equal to 0.05 and less than 0.10 [105]. There are no inﬂuences of
independent variables on dependent variables if the p-value is greater than or equal
to 0.10 [105]. According to Table 6, hedonism, achievement, and tradition have
strong correlations with area. The p-values are 0.000 for hedonism and achievement,
while 0.001 for tradition. Similarly, power and security have strong correlations with
household income (p-values are 0.001 and 0.004 respectively). There are moderate
signiﬁcance of age on security, the p-value is 0.037. However, all the demographics
except “highest level of education in family” have weak signiﬁcance on some of the
values. For example, age has weak inﬂuence on universalism (p-value is 0.083), while
education level has weak correlations with hedonism and achievement (p-values are
0.083 and 0.082 respectively). Similarly, there are weak signiﬁcance of the number
of educated family members on self-direction (p-value is 0.089), area on benevolence
(p-value is 0.063), and household income on benevolence (p-value is 0.087) and con-
formity (p-value is 0.094). However, the demographics have no signiﬁcant inﬂuences
on the rest of the values.

Table 7 shows the presence of multicollinearity in the regression analysis through

the Variance Inﬂation Factor (VIF). Multicollinearity investigates the presence of
linear relations among independent variables [106]. In other words, multicollinearity
occurs when there are strong correlations among two or more independent variables.
There is a high presence of multicollinearity in regression analysis if the VIF value
is greater than ten (10) [106]. As shown in Table 7, all the VIF values are less than
ten. Therefore, multicollinearity is not present in the regression analysis.

Table 8 shows the results of R2 in the regression analysis. The demographics
act as the most signiﬁcant predictors for achievement, as they explain 16.9% (0.169)
of the variance. The scores of R2 are also high for hedonism and tradition, 11.8%
(0.118) and 11% (0.110) respectively, resulting the demographics are also signiﬁcant
for these two values. The demographics work as the least signiﬁcant predictors for
self-direction and stimulation, as they explain 3.2% (0.032) of the variance for both.

5. Discussion and Implications

5.1. Analysis of the Results

The results of RQ1 (see Section 4.1) identiﬁed three underlying factors of Bangladeshi

female farmers’ values. In other words, three groups of Bangladeshi female farmers
emerged according to their value preferences. The ﬁrst group can be considered as
benevolent, conscious, respectful, universalist, and conservative. This is because, the
ﬁrst factor consists of ﬁve values: benevolence, security, conformity, universalism,
and tradition. Similarly, the second group can be considered as self-directed and
adventurous, as Factor2 comprises of two values, self-direction and stimulation. The
third group of Bangladeshi female farmers can be considered as hedonist, aspiring,
and powerful due to the three values (power, achievement, and hedonism) which are
included in Factor3.

After comparing the preferred values of these three groups with Schwartz’s theory
of basic values (see Figure 1), we argue that the results of RQ1 are in line with
Schwartz’s theory. For example, universalism, benevolence, conformity, tradition,
and security are the important values for the participants of the ﬁrst group. All these
values are located close to each other in Schwartz’s theory as well. The participants
of the second group preferred self-direction and stimulation, which are also located
next to each other in Schwartz’s theory. The participants of the last group consists
of the values, power, achievement, and hedonism, which are also placed together in
Schwartz’s theory. According to Schwartz, values located close to each other are
congruent and those further apart are opposite in nature [28, 22]. Therefore, it
veriﬁed the accuracy of the results of the factor analysis, where all the three groups
included values which are congruent in nature.

29

The results of RQ1 can also be compared with the results of one of our pa-
pers that measured Bangladeshi female farmers’ value priorities [19]. For example,
Bangladeshi female farmers have positive priorities for all the ﬁve values which are
grouped together in the ﬁrst factor. On the other hand, power and hedonism are the
least important values of Bangladeshi female farmers. Also, these two values together
develop the third factor. However, the second factor consists of self-direction and
stimulation, whereas self-direction is positive and stimulation is negative priority for
Bangladeshi female farmers.

Analysis of the Results

Bangladeshi female farmers can be divided into three groups according to their
values. The participants of the ﬁrst group are benevolent, conscious, respectful,
universalist, and conservative. The second group participants are self-directed
and adventurous. The third group participants are hedonist, aspiring, and
powerful.

5.2. Implications for Apps Development

One of our papers identiﬁed the overall value priorities of Bangladeshi female
farmers [19]. If the developers develop agriculture apps based on the most preferred
values shown in this paper [19], majority of the Bangladeshi female farmers’ val-
ues should be addressed in the apps. However, there is also a chance that a small
group of end-users’ values might be ignored in those apps if they have a diﬀerent
value priorities. To avoid this issue, this study investigated if there are any groups
of Bangladeshi female farmers who have the similar preferred values. As this study
identiﬁed three groups of Bangladeshi female farmers according to their value pref-
erences, agriculture apps should be diﬀerent for these three groups. We recommend
applying three diﬀerent apps design strategies for these three groups of end-users of
agriculture apps. In particular, we recommend apps developers to develop agricul-
ture apps for Bangladeshi female farmers considering the speciﬁc values depending on
which group(s) are the target end-users. For example, if the target users are benevo-
lent, conscious, respectful, universalist, and conservative Bangladeshi female farmers
(group 1), the apps should reﬂect benevolence, security, conformity, universalism,
and tradition. On the other hand, self-direction, stimulation, power, achievement,
and hedonism should not be reﬂected in those apps, because these values are not
preferred by the target end-users. Similarly, the agriculture apps for Bangladeshi fe-
male farmers should be diﬀerent depending on the target end-users’ demographics as
well. Developers need to be conscious about addressing the values that have strong

30

correlations with demographics during apps development for diﬀerent demographic
groups. Therefore, we also recommend further research to propose strategies for apps
development for diﬀerent demographic groups.

Implication 1 for Apps Development

Bangladeshi agriculture apps developers are recommended to apply a partic-
ular set of apps design strategies and/or approach for a speciﬁc group of the
target end-users according to their value preferences.

The ﬁndings of this study encourage developers to pay attention to end-users’
values during apps development to promote the use of the apps. However, it can be
argued that embedding end-users’ existing values into an app does not always have
positive impacts on end-users’ lives. Designing apps that reinforce existing value sets
might cause negative impacts on human lives. This is because if a society arguably
has negative values, addressing those values in apps might amplify the negativity.
For example, a subjugated population might have values that reﬂect subjugation.
Therefore, we recommend further research to understand when reinforcing existing
value sets in apps design might have positive impacts and when negative. As people
ubiquitously use apps in their daily activities nowadays, this is an opportunity to
use apps to discourage the negative values of the end-users and help free them from
those negative values. Therefore, we recommend to investigate the extent to which
values-based design of mobile apps should embed existing set of end-users’ values
and what attempts can be taken to nudge end-users towards an alternative set of
values.

Implication 2 for Apps Development

Further research is recommended to explore the extent to which values-based
design of mobile apps should embed existing set of end-users’ values and what
attempts can be taken to nudge end-users towards an alternative set of values.

6. Threats to Validity

This section discusses the possible threats arising from this research according to
the four validation criteria: credibility, conﬁrmability, dependability, and transfer-
ability [107].

31

6.1. Credibility

A potential threat to the credibility of this research could arise from partici-
pants’ selection approach. To mitigate this threat, we requested help from the senior
employees of Oxfam Bangladesh. They have several years of experience working
with Bangladeshi female farmers. After knowing the objectives of this research and
participants’ selection criteria, they introduced us to the right participants.

6.2. Conﬁrmability

A potential threat to conﬁrmability could arise from the absence of data-source
triangulation and the validity of the results. We accept that data-source triangulation
could verify the results and increase the conﬁrmability of this research. However,
we mitigated this threat by using a universal value measurement instrument which
was used to examine the cross-cultural validity of Schwartz’s values theory [34]. It
was used in several countries with diﬀerent cultural settings to investigate human
values. Furthermore, the large number of participants in this survey also increased
the plausibility of our ﬁndings.

6.3. Dependability

A potential threat to the dependability of this research could arise from the lack
of understanding of human values. This is because of the ill-deﬁned, ambiguous, and
implicit nature of human values [11] and the absence of deﬁnitions of human values
from mobile apps/software engineering perspectives. However, no questions in PVQ
contained the term “values” directly, which minimized the chance of misunderstand-
ing this term.

6.4. Transferability

A potential threat to the transferability of this research could arise due to the
focus on a speciﬁc group of end-users, Bangladeshi female farmers. As diﬀerent
groups of end-users might have diﬀerent values when using diﬀerent apps, it can be
argued that the results of this research cannot be generalized for all the end-users of
mobile apps. However, we believe the results can be used for the users and apps of
other developing countries like Bangladesh. Furthermore, the methodology used in
this research can be replicated for the users and apps in diﬀerent cultural settings in
other countries.

7. Conclusions and Future Work

7.1. Conclusions

Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
were conducted to explore the possible underlying factor structure of Bangladeshi
female farmers’ values (RQ1). CFA on the 40 value items of the survey with 193
Bangladeshi female farmers shows that the survey data is aligned with Schwartz’s
theory and a good ﬁt for advanced statistical analysis. EFA was also conducted
on the ten main value categories which identiﬁed three (3) underlying factors of
Bangladeshi female farmers’ values. The ﬁrst factor comprises of ﬁve values: benev-
olence, security, conformity, universalism, and tradition. The second factor consists
of two values: self-direction and stimulation. The third factor includes the rest of the
three values: power, achievement, and hedonism. CFA was again conducted on the
main value categories which conﬁrmed the ﬁndings of the EFA by developing a CFA
model. Considering the three factors, Bangladeshi female farmers can be divided
into three groups according to their values. The participants of the ﬁrst group are
benevolent, conscious, respectful, universalist, and conservative. The second group
participants are self-directed and adventurous. The third group participants are
hedonist, aspiring, and powerful.

A multiple linear regression method was also applied on the survey data to explore
the inﬂuences of demographics on Bangladeshi female farmers’ values (RQ2). The
results identiﬁed strong inﬂuences of area on three values: hedonism, achievement,
and tradition. There are also strong inﬂuences of household income on power and
security. Moderate inﬂuence of age was identiﬁed on security. However, age has weak
inﬂuence on universalism; education level on hedonism and achievement; number of
educated family members on self-direction; area on benevolence; household income
on benevolence and conformity.

This research creates awareness among software engineering researchers and soft-
ware applications developers to consider human values in mobile apps. The ﬁndings
of this research provide implications for software engineering research and practices
on how to measure the factor structure of end-users’ values who are vulnerable groups
of women, which of their values should be addressed during apps development for
diﬀerent value groups and diﬀerent demographic groups of end-users.

7.2. Future Work

The replication of this research with larger samples from diﬀerent cultural set-
tings could be a signiﬁcant future work to observe if there are any cultural diﬀerences
regarding the values of end-users of mobile apps. For example, this research could

33

be replicated with Bangladeshi male farmers to determine the extent to which the
values are gender-speciﬁc. Empirical data from other end-users of apps from dif-
ferent cultural settings could also be collected to ensure the transferability of this
research. In addition, it would be interesting to conduct a similar empirical study
of the agriculture mobile apps of other developing countries. It would provide an
opportunity to compare the values of the end-users.

As we identiﬁed three diﬀerent groups of Bangladeshi female farmers according
to their values, the agriculture apps developed for them should also be diﬀerent. Al-
though one of our paper proposed strategies to address Bangladeshi female farmers’
values in agriculture apps [70], we recommend developing diﬀerent apps design strate-
gies for diﬀerent groups of Bangladeshi female farmers. Therefore, there is room for
research to develop agriculture apps for Bangladeshi female farmers considering the
speciﬁc values depending on which group(s) are the target end-users.

A potential research direction could focus on whether embedding end-users’ ex-
isting values into an app always has positive impacts on end-users’ lives. If the users
arguably have negative values (e.g., subjugation, exercising power), addressing those
values in apps might amplify the negativity. Therefore, extensive research in social
science, psychology, geopolitics, and behavioural science is required to understand
when reinforcing existing value sets in apps design might have positive impacts and
when negative. If the users have negative values, apps should actively try to discour-
age those. Therefore, a potential future work could investigate the extent to which
apps should embed existing end-users’ values and what attempts can be taken to
nudge end-users towards an alternative set of values.
