ABSTRACT

Context. In the framework of cosmic microwave background polarization studies and the characterization of its Galactic foregrounds,
the angular power spectrum analysis of the thermal dust polarization map has led to intriguing evidence of an E/B asymmetry and a
positive T E correlation. The interpretation of these observations are the subject of theoretical and simulation-driven studies in which
the correlation between the density structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the magnetic ﬁeld appear to be a key aspect. In
this context, and when the magnetized ISM structures are modeled in three dimensions, dust clouds are generally considered to be
ﬁlamentary structures only, while both ﬁlamentary and sheet-like shapes are supported by observational and theoretical evidence.
Aims. In this work, we aim to study the inﬂuence of cloud shape and its connection to the local magnetic ﬁeld, as well as the inﬂuence
from the viewing angle, on the angular power spectra measured on thermal dust polarization maps; we speciﬁcally focus on the
dependence of the E/B power asymmetry and T E correlation.
Methods. To that end, we simulate realistic interstellar clouds with both ﬁlament-like and sheet-like shapes using the software Aste-
rion which also allows us to generate synthetic maps of thermal dust polarized emission with an area of 400 square degrees. Then,
we compute their polarization power spectra in multipole range (cid:96) ∈ [100, 500] and focus on the E/B power asymmetry, quantiﬁed
through the REB ratio, and the correlation coeﬃcient rT E between T and E modes. We quantify the dependence of REB and rT E values
on the oﬀset angle (between the longest cloud axis and local magnetic ﬁeld lines) and inclination angle (between the line of sight and
the magnetic ﬁeld) for both types of cloud shapes either embedded in a regular magnetic ﬁeld or coupled to a non-regular ﬁeld to
mimic turbulence.
Results. We ﬁnd that both types of cloud shapes cover the same regions of the (REB, rT E) parameter space. The dependence on the
inclination and oﬀset angles are similar for both shapes although sheet-like structures generally show larger scatter as compared to
ﬁlamentary structures. In addition to the known dependence on the oﬀset angle, we ﬁnd a strong dependence of REB and rT E on the
inclination angle.
Conclusions. The very fact that ﬁlament-like and sheet-like structures may lead to polarization power spectra with similar (REB, rT E)
values complicates their interpretation. We argue that interpreting them solely in terms of ﬁlament characteristics is risky and that in
future analyses, this degeneracy should be accounted for as well as the connection to the magnetic ﬁeld geometry. Indeed, our results
from 400 square degrees maps make it clear that the overall geometrical arrangement of the magnetized ISM surrounding the observer
leaves its marks on polarization power spectra.

Key words. ISM: dust, magnetic ﬁelds – submillimeter: ISM – polarization – (cosmology) cosmic background radiation

1. Introduction

The study of polarization of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) is very important for the ﬁeld of cosmology as it is the
only foreseeable way to test observationally whether the Uni-
verse has undergone an early period of inﬂationary expansion.
Indeed, gravitational waves generated during the inﬂation era
would have left unambiguous imprints on CMB polarization.
These imprints are the so-called B-modes in the polarization
power spectra which, although diﬃcult to detect, are in principle
observable (Polnarev 1985).

Most of the cosmological information can be obtained from
the CMB radiation through the analysis of its T , E, and B angu-
lar power spectra (intensity and linear polarization) and their cor-
relation (e.g., Kamionkowski et al. 1997; Seljak & Zaldarriaga
1997; Hu & White 1997) in which the polarization is decom-
posed into a scalar, curl-free ﬁeld, the E mode, and a pseudo-
scalar, curl ﬁeld, the B mode.

Galactic dust, through which we observe the CMB, contam-
inates the cosmological signal as the grain thermal emission is
also polarized and contains B-mode components as well. Non-
spherical dust grains align their short axis with the magnetic ﬁeld
of the Galaxy which is present everywhere. As a result, they emit
thermal radiation with their electric vector preferentially aligned
with their long axis (e.g., Andersson et al. 2015). The polarized
emission from Galactic dust grains, with polarization fraction
about 20% (e.g., Benoît et al. 2004; Planck Collaboration XII
2020), higher than that of the CMB, which is about 5% (Bond &
Efstathiou 1987; Seljak 1997; Hinshaw et al. 2003), always dom-
inates the measured signal at frequency higher than ≈ 80 GHz
(e.g., Planck Collaboration Int. XXX 2016). The B-mode com-
ponent of Galactic thermal dust emission can be confused with
the primordial signal of inﬂation (e.g., BICEP2 Collaboration
et al. 2014; Planck Collaboration Int. XXX 2016; Planck Col-
laboration XI 2020). It is therefore essential to understand the
emission and absorption properties of interstellar dust so as to
remove its contribution to the map of the polarized primordial
microwave sky.

In this context, the dust polarization is characterized by its T ,
E, and B representations rather than through its representation
in Stokes parameters I, Q, and U. E and B are invariant under
rotations making the E-B decomposition more convenient since
it is unnecessary to deﬁne a reference frame.

The characterization of the dust polarization auto- and cross-
angular power spectra has led to the intriguing evidences, ﬁrst re-
ported in (Planck Collaboration Int. XXXVIII 2016), for an E/B
asymmetry (REB ∼ 2) and a positive T E correlation (rT E ∼ 0.36)
that were not anticipated, at least for sky regions at interme-
diate and high Galactic latitudes in which a weak signal with
random polarization orientations was expected from the dust.
Dedicated analysis of the data has revealed that this -a priori
unexpected- signal may likely originate from the observed cor-
relation between the orientation of ridges seen in intensity maps
and the sky-projected orientation of the integrated magnetic ﬁeld
(Planck Collaboration Int. XXXII 2016; Planck Collaboration
Int. XXXV 2016; Planck Collaboration Int. XXXVIII 2016;
Rotti & Huﬀenberger 2019; Soler 2019). Such a correlation be-
tween ISM clouds and magnetic ﬁeld was known for some time
for molecular clouds (e.g., Goodman et al. (1990)) and subse-
quently observed for clouds of the diﬀuse ISM seen in HI emis-
sion (McClure-Griﬃths et al. 2006; Clark et al. 2014). This ob-
served correlation is likely the result of the coupling of inter-
stellar matter and the ambient magnetic ﬁeld, which is expected
in the framework of the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) descrip-
tion of ISM and it has been extensively discussed in the literature
(e.g., Hennebelle 2013; Soler et al. 2013; Caldwell et al. 2017;
Kandel et al. 2018; Kim et al. 2019).

To make progress in the characterization of Galactic fore-
grounds to the CMB polarization, it is necessary to consider the
sky and the ISM structures as three-dimensional (3D) systems
projected onto the sky (e.g., Tassis & Pavlidou 2015; Pelgrims
et al. 2021a). In this context, dedicated studies have been car-
ried out to estimate and characterize the result of projection ef-
fects of ISM structures to the measured polarization power spec-
tra (e.g., Rotti & Huﬀenberger 2019; Huﬀenberger et al. 2020;
Hervías-Caimapo et al. 2021). In these studies, the shape of ISM
structures have been routinely, if not exclusively, assumed to be
ﬁlamentary. The authors have indeed considered and modeled
ISM clouds as being cylinders or prolate (elongated) spheroids.
However, to date, there is no consensus that all ISM clouds have
a ﬁlament-like morphology. On the contrary, numerical simu-
lations show that turbulent ﬂows tend to stretch and compress
the ISM gas into sheet-like and ﬁlament-like structures, which
appear elongated in column density maps because of projection
eﬀects (e.g., Hennebelle 2013). This shape ambiguity is not new
and has been at the heart of a long lasting debate in the ISM lit-
erature (e.g., Kainulainen et al. 2016 vs. Tritsis & Tassis 2018).
Dense, molecular, self-gravitating clouds generally appear ﬁla-
mentary on the sky, giving rise to the picture of a cosmic web
in which clouds fragment to give rise to star-forming regions at
its nodes (e.g., Myers 2009). However, there are several obser-
vational pieces of evidence indicating the existence of clouds
with sheet-like morphology that are necessary to explain light
echoes of supernovae explosions and pulsar scattering data (e.g.,
Williamson 1972; Suntzeﬀ et al. 1988; Spyromilio et al. 1995;
Brisken et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2016). Such sheet-like clouds
may result from large scale planar shocks when supernovae in-
duced bubbles interact (Hartmann et al. 2001). In addition, the
very fact that ﬁlamentary patterns are not all straight but may
show large-scale curvature, as suggested in (Planck Collabora-
tion Int. XXXVIII 2016), might also be indicative of sheet-like
structures that would, for example, be part of expanding bub-

bles, and would appear brighter where viewed tangentially (e.g.,
Tahani et al. 2022). Hence, while diverse observations of the dif-
fuse ISM -from relatively low-resolution submillimeter observa-
tions by Planck to high-resolution infrared observations by Her-
schel, and of HI observation in the radio waves (e.g., Kalberla
& Kerp 2009; Miville-Deschênes et al. 2010; André et al. 2014;
Clark et al. 2014)- reveal its ﬁlamentary appearance, it might
very well be that it is made of clouds having both ﬁlament-like
and sheet-like shapes.

The preferred shape of ISM clouds in the diﬀuse ISM, along
with their speciﬁc relation to the magnetic ﬁeld orientation, is
expected to depend on the exact balance of several factors: mag-
netic ﬁeld strength, gravitational energy, and turbulent energy
(e.g., Heiles & Crutcher 2005; Crutcher et al. 2010; Soler et al.
2013). However, it is very challenging to determine observa-
tionally the regime corresponding to any given ISM region. The
characterization of relative orientations between apparent struc-
tures and projected magnetic ﬁeld is an equally diﬃcult task,
with results that may also depend on the details of the speciﬁc
method used in the analysis (e.g., Micelotta et al. 2021).

In this paper, motivated by the fact that the possibility
for sheet-like clouds has been disregarded so far in CMB-
foreground characterization studies that want to account for 3D
eﬀects, we explore the possible eﬀects from ISM-cloud mor-
phology on the characterization of polarization power spectra.

Our main goal is to study how the shape of interstellar clouds
aﬀects the angular power spectra of emitted polarized radiation
from dust. We set up a simulation-based experiment to investi-
gate the degeneracy that cloud shapes might lead to in the prop-
erties of observed polarization power spectra. Our toy-models
allow us to quantify the eﬀect of the angle between the structure-
major axes and the local magnetic ﬁeld orientation, as well as
the eﬀect of the viewing angle, i.e. the angle that the sight-lines
make with the magnetic ﬁeld lines.

We simulate interstellar clouds with both ﬁlamentary and
sheet-like structure using the software Asterion that we devel-
oped and present in Sect. 2, where we also produce synthetic
polarization maps and compute their angular power spectra. In
Sect. 3 we present the results of our exploration of the eﬀect
the two angles have on the power asymmetry between E and B
modes, and on the correlation between T and E modes. We dis-
cuss our results in Sect. 4 and provide our conclusions in Sect. 5.

2. Numerics & synthetic data

2.1. Asterion

2.1.1. The software
Asterion is a scientiﬁc tool to simulate the magnetized ISM of
our Galaxy in 3D, including dust clouds and the magnetic ﬁeld
that permeates them, to directly visualize the data in 3D and in-
teract with it into an immersed virtual environment.

Ultimately, we hope that Asterion will assist in the recon-
struction of the 3D structure of the magnetized ISM of our
Galaxy, a long-standing problem in the quest for the origin of
the magnetic ﬁeld in our Galaxy. Asterion relies on real time
3D visualization techniques with virtual reality capabilities that
reach a high degree of performance. It allows us to render the
details of the magnetized ISM and enables the user to interact
with the simulated environment as it is done in video games.

Asterion is not meant to be another visualization and ray-
tracing tool, with or without radiative transfer implemented, as
already existing ones such as Polaris (Reissl et al. 2016). As-

terion enables real-time reprocessing of portions of the visual-
ized data at a higher resolution, allowing sub-grid details to be
computed and added to the visualized data in real-time. Aster-
ion is implemented in the Real-Time-Engine ‘Unreal Engine 4’
(UE4)1.

The core features of creating and visualizing 3D structures
use the parallel-computation paradigm and utilize the beneﬁts of
modern Graphics Processing Units (GPU). A signiﬁcant amount
of hardware threads (Shaders) performs calculations indepen-
dently and presents solutions at once, as 3D textures, available
for further computation and visualization.

Within Asterion (currently at the prototype level), the user
is immersed in a 3D environment that emulates the Galaxy. The
user can ﬂy through the Galactic space and visualize dust den-
sity distribution and magnetic ﬁeld. For the purpose of this work
the user can specify, through a set of parameters, the large-scale
dust-density distribution model, the large-scale Galactic mag-
netic ﬁeld model and, clouds of dust with non-trivial morphol-
ogy following some orientation relation with the ambient mag-
netic ﬁeld lines. The structures become accessible using interac-
tive controls and volume-rendering techniques. The user can also
specify a virtual-telescope (Observer) in the environment and
output two-dimensional (2D) projections (polarization and col-
umn density maps) with given angular size. These polarization
maps, intended to simulate observations of the polarized thermal
dust emission in the sub-millimeter, encode information on the
density and the magnetic ﬁeld properties of the observed portion
of the Galaxy. These outputs can then be analyzed externally as
if they were actual observations. To allow for statistical analyses
and to make Asterion produce massive amounts of selected out-
puts, input speciﬁcations in the form of setup ﬁles (CSV format)
can be passed into Asterion, which runs over each and produces
the corresponding output maps in an automated way.

In its current implementation, Asterion simulates both the
Galaxy at the large scales and dust clouds with higher spatial
resolution in a smaller volume. Both volumes are sampled by
cubic grids made of 2563 voxels. The low-resolution, large-scale,
grid is 40 kpc on a side and the high-resolution grid has a size
that can be adjusted by the user. Both grids are represented as
Volume-Texture on the GPUs and, for each cell, local density
and magnetic ﬁeld as deﬁned by model settings is rendered.

Within Asterion, both the location of the high-resolution ob-
served box (OB) and the observer can be determined by the user
who is free to move independently through space. The position
of the observer is set in a heliocentric Cartesian coordinate sys-
tem and the OB location is ﬁxed through speciﬁcation of the
longitude, latitude and distance as seen from the observer. The
outputs that are generated by the software and that are of interest
in this study (see Sect. 2.1.2) are related to the polarized thermal
dust emission and correspond to the view of the OB (contain-
ing simulated clouds at high-resolution) as seen by the observer.
Only the volume spanned by the OB is mapped into the out-
puts. We make this choice to make it possible, in the future, to
simulate large volumes with high-resolution capabilities by the
production of mosaic in 3D.

1 UE4 is a complete suite of development tools that allows for cut-
ting edge visualization and immersive virtual worlds, multi-platform de-
ployment, asset and plugin marketplace, among other features (https:
//www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal).

2.1.2. Polarized thermal dust emission model

For a given setup of the simulated magnetized ISM, synthetic
observation of the thermal dust polarization and column density
can be produced by the software. These come in the form of four
maps: I, Q, U for the three Stokes parameters of the linear po-
larization of the thermal dust emission, and K for the total col-
umn density. These quantities are obtained through integration
along the lines of sight through the OB according to the follow-
ing equations:

where r is the radial distance from the observer along a given
line of sight with direction speciﬁed by n. The diﬀerent terms in
the equation are:

– p is a parameter dependent on dust polarization properties
(grain cross sections and the degree of alignment with the
magnetic ﬁeld), taking a value of 0.25 in this work 2
– nd(r, n) is the 3D dust grain density at position (r, n)
– α(r, n) is the inclination angle between the magnetic ﬁeld

and the line of sight at (r, n)

– ψ(r, n) is the local plane-of-sky polarization angle expressed

as
ψ(r, n) = 1

arctan

(cid:32) −2 Bθ(r, n) Bφ(r, n)
Bφ(r, n)2 − Bθ(r, n)2

(cid:33)

,

(5)

where Bθ and Bφ are the local transverse components of
the magnetic ﬁeld in the local spherical coordinate basis
(er, eθ, eφ) with eθ pointing towards the South pole. ψ(r, n) is
rotated 90◦ from the position angle of the plane-of-sky com-
ponent of the local magnetic ﬁeld.

This formulation assumes that the emissivity of the dust grains is
constant through the Galaxy despite known evidences for vari-
ations of the dust spectral energy distribution (e.g., Finkbeiner
et al. 1999; Planck Collaboration XI 2014; Pelgrims et al.
2021a).

As we do not consider multi-frequency analysis in this study,
we are not aﬀected by such variations which, in any case, should
be small since we only produce maps corresponding to small 3D
volumes to achieve high spatial resolution.

2.1.3. Populating the Galactic space with dust
Within Asterion the Galaxy is populated by dust grains accord-
ing to a smooth large-scale density distribution on top of which

2 This is a rather high value compared to the value of 0.2 used in Planck
Collaboration Int. XX (2015). The choice of this value is motivated by
the fact that it leads to average degree of polarization of ≈ 21% in the
maps that we generate in Sect. 2.2 when the magnetic ﬁeld is in the
plane of the sky. We note that the exact value of this parameter does
not aﬀect our analysis nor our main conclusion. A purely multiplica-
tive rescaling of p aﬀects the scaling of the power spectra but not the
parameters REB and rT E (Huﬀenberger et al. 2020).

ﬁlaments

sheets

Fig. 1. Column density (K) maps obtained for ﬁlament-like (left) and sheet-like (right) density structures with diﬀerent wiggle parameters. The
wiggle intensity (wi) is constant in columns and increases from left to right and the wiggle correlation length (wc) is constant in rows and increases
from top to bottom. In our settings, wi and wc have units of [pc/(100 × 200)]. The shape parameters of ﬁlaments and sheets are the same in each
panel and read as follows (in pc). Filaments: L ∈ [7, 25] and R ∈ [1.5, 4.5]; Sheets: L ∈ [5, 20], R12 ∈ [10, 20] and R13 ∈ [1, 3] (see Sect. 2.1.4
and Table 1 for parameter deﬁnitions and labels.) The circular regions displayed on those maps have an angular radius of 12.53◦. All maps share
the same color scale, which is expressed in 1021 cm−2.

dust-cloud structures are added. The large-scale density distri-
bution follows a parametric model that implements either the
exponential disk model (ED) or the four logarithmic-spiral arms
model (ARM4) discussed and adjusted to a full-sky Planck map
in Pelgrims et al. (2021b). Their ARM4 model with best-ﬁt pa-
rameter values is implemented as default in Asterion and we
use that model in this work. The large-scale model ﬁlls the low-
resolution grid which is then integrated to generate a dust col-
umn density map as seen from the Sun’s location. A latitude
proﬁle is subsequently built and a normalization factor is com-
puted such that it ﬁts the well-known relation (Kulkarni & Heiles
1987; Heiles & Troland 2003):
NHI(b) = 3.7
sin(|b|)

× 1020 [cm−2],

(6)

where NHI is the column density of neutral hydrogen atoms and
b is Galactic latitude.

The normalization factor ﬁxes the proportionality in Eq. 4
leading the large-scale density distribution model to determine
the number density of hydrogen atoms in any place in the
Galaxy. The propagation of this normalization factor to Eqs. 1
to 3 implies that our polarization maps (I, Q, and U) are given
in units of dust grain emissivity, as stated above.

The particle density assigned to the high-resolution box (i.e.,
the OB) is calculated from this large-scale model which is eval-
uated at the location of the center of the OB. Inside the OB,
the total number of particles is determined by assuming that the
matter in the OB is constant and therefore, scales with the OB
volume. The total number of particles is then divided into two
phases of the ISM which are the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM)
and the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) (e.g., Wolﬁre et al. 2003).
In Asterion we assume that the WNM corresponds to a very dif-
fuse component that follows the large-scale density distribution
model, whereas the CNM forms the ISM structures (the clouds)
which will appear brighter on the maps. The modeling of the

Article number, page 4 of 16

clouds which we consider as being either ﬁlament-like or sheet-
like structures is discussed in Sect. 2.1.4. The relative contribu-
tion of CNM and WNM to build the column density is a free
parameter in Asterion. We currently do not consider the possi-
bility for a contribution from an unstable neutral medium phase
(Ghosh et al. 2017; Adak et al. 2020).

Assuming a given number density of dust particles in clouds
and given the volume of the dust clouds that we model, the num-
ber of clouds required to account for the mass of the CNM in the
OB is automatically determined. The clouds are then placed ran-
domly within the OB according to a uniform distribution. Both
the particle number density and the morphology of the clouds
are parameters that the user can tune.

The orientation of clouds in the 3D space are not random. It
is now well established observationally that the main axes of the
projected shapes of ISM structures show orientations that are not
independent of the orientation of the ambient plane-of-sky com-
ponent of the magnetic ﬁeld. Both orientations appear preferen-
tially parallel or perpendicular, depending on their column den-
sity (e.g., Planck Collaboration Int. XXXII 2016; Planck Col-
laboration Int. XXXV 2016; Clark 2017; Soler 2019) and this
alignment and misalignment may lead to diﬀerences in charac-
teristics of the polarization power spectra (Planck Collaboration
Int. XXXVIII 2016; Huﬀenberger et al. 2020; Clark et al. 2021).
To control this correlation, Asterion allows the user to vary the
angle of each cloud in 3D with the local magnetic ﬁeld. We refer
to this angle as the oﬀset angle which we denote ω. The im-
plementation of magnetic ﬁeld is discussed in Sect. 2.1.5. The
correlation between dust density structures and local magnetic
ﬁeld is further discussed in Sect. 2.1.6.

2.1.4. Dust cloud structures

Asterion allows for the creation and visualization of dust clouds
of the ISM that are either ﬁlament-like or sheet-like. The basic

Konstantinou , V. Pelgrims , F. Fuchs and K. Tassis : Polarization power spectra and dust cloud morphology

ﬁlaments

sheets

Fig. 2. Stokes Q polarization maps obtained for ﬁlaments (left) and sheets (right) with diﬀerent parameter values for the stochastic component
of the magnetic ﬁeld Bsto. The component amplitude (ni) is constant in column and increases from left to right and the correlation length (nc) is
constant in rows and increases from top to bottom. The circular regions, here centered on the North Galactic pole, have an angular radius of 12.53◦.
Shape parameters, including those controlling the wiggles, are the same as in Fig. 3 and are kept ﬁxed between panels. All maps share the same
color scale.

regular geometric shapes, which are then perturbed, are cylinders
and ﬂat rectangular parallelepipeds for ﬁlaments and sheets, re-
spectively. The user can control the shape parameters (size, axis
ratio, etc) and the density of dust grains within the structure.
Generally, input parameters control the ranges of possible val-
ues and, internally, the software seeks random numbers from a
uniform distribution to create any given implementation. This
feature ensures intrinsic scatter which account for the fact that
all dust clouds in the ISM are not identical.

These basic shapes are then perturbed in order to make their
appearance more realistic, producing ‘wiggles’. For this pur-
pose, Asterion relies on the use of Perlin noise. Perlin noise is a
type of gradient noise used to increase appearance of realism in
computer graphics simulating textures (Perlin 1985). This tech-
nology is extensively used in video games and by the imaging
industry. Two parameters control the properties of the noise, an
amplitude (wi) and a correlation length (wc), that the user can
change.

Finally, the density distribution within the OB is smoothed in
3D through a distance-weighted averaging of the densities from
direct neighboring voxels. This smoothing is such that the total
mass is conserved. It is applied to avoid sharp transitions be-
tween structures and their surroundings.

When the emission is integrated along the lines of sight (see
Eq. 1), dust clouds can appear as illustrated in Fig. 1 where we
show the intensity maps (Eq. 1) of a population of ﬁlaments (left
panel) and sheets (right panel) obtained for diﬀerent combina-
tions of the wiggle parameters. In these sky maps, the major
axes of all the structures are horizontal. In the case of sheet-like
clouds, the orientation of the minor axes are not bounded, which
makes it possible to observe a cloud either edge-on or face-on.
Among maps of ﬁlaments (sheets), only the wiggle parameters
change, the 3D positioning of the clouds and their main orienta-
tion remain unchanged. In Fig. 1, the wiggle amplitude is con-
stant through columns and increases from left to right while the
wiggle correlation length is constant through rows and increases

from top to bottom. The larger wi and the smaller wc, the noisier
the structures.

2.1.5. Magnetic ﬁeld

A parametric model for the regular large-scale Galactic mag-
netic ﬁeld is assumed in Asterion. Two models of the mag-
netic ﬁeld are implemented: the Logarithmic Spiral Arm model
of Page et al. (2007) with the best-ﬁt parameters obtained by
Pelgrims et al. (2021b) for a ﬁt to dust polarization maps, and a
four logarithmic-spiral arms model with plane-parallel ﬁeld lines
but with an azimuthal modulation of the strength that follow the
large-scale dust density. The latter is the model that we use in this
work despite the fact that it has never been tested against data.
Our choice is only motivated by the fact that this model allows
for an easier control of the relative orientation of the ﬁeld lines
with respect to the lines of sight of observation (see Sect. 2.2).

2.1.6. Mimicking MHD turbulence

Following the description above, our simplistic approach to
model the magnetized ISM does not couple matter density distri-
bution and magnetic ﬁeld as MHD equations do. To implement
such a coupling in our toy-model and allow for the magnetic ﬁeld
lines to depart from the large-scale regular model, we proceed as
follows.

First, we add a stochastic component to the magnetic ﬁeld
in the OB. The stochastic component is a random realization
of a Perlin-noise vector ﬁeld. This choice has the advantage of
creating anisotropic ﬂuctuations in the magnetic ﬁeld directions.
Two parameters control the stochastic component of the mag-
netic ﬁeld; the amplitude of the ﬂuctuations (ni) measured in µG
and a correlation length (nc). Then, we add the density struc-
tures (clouds). They are ﬁrst placed and oriented as before and
then modiﬁed (perturbed). To account for coupling we rely on
the ﬂux-freezing approximation (expected to be very accurate at

the low density clouds we consider here for the high Galactic
latitudes of interest), which dictates that matter can move freely
along magnetic ﬁeld lines. Therefore, a shift along the local (to-
tal) magnetic ﬁeld line is imposed to each voxel of each cloud.
The amplitude of the shifts and their spatial correlation is ob-
tained from a scalar Perlin noise (the one that is used to generate
the wiggles in the previous section) which is again controlled
by the wiggle intensity (wi) and wiggle correlation (wc) param-
eters. Given our implementation, the structures can be squeezed
or stretched along the magnetic ﬁeld lines and compression and
rarefaction can happen if the ﬁeld lines converge or diverge.
As a result, within individual structures, overdensities generally
appear where magnetic ﬁeld lines are more compressed as ob-
served in the magnetized ISM (e.g., Heyvaerts & Priest 1983;
Heiles & Troland 2003).

The eﬀect of the stochastic component in the magnetic ﬁeld
is demonstrated in Fig. 2 where we show maps of the Stokes
Q (Eq. 2) of a population of ﬁlaments (left) and sheets (right)
located in a circular region towards the North Galactic pole. The
orientation of the regular magnetic ﬁeld crosses the sky regions
making an angle of 28◦ with the horizontal which corresponds
to the value of the pitch angle of the spiral arms in our model.
In those panels, only the parameters of the stochastic magnetic-
ﬁeld component vary; ni is constant in columns and increases
from left to right with values of ni = 0.02, 0.05 and 0.08, and nc
is constant in rows and increases from top to bottom with values
of nc = 0.005, 0.015, 0.035. The parameters of the wiggles are
ﬁxed to (wi, wc) = (0.2, 0.001).

The eﬀects of varying the wiggle parameters to perturb
the density structures in this coupling scheme are illustrated in
Fig. 3. To produce those synthetic maps we proceed as for Fig. 1
(with (ω, α) = (0◦, 90◦)) and ﬁx the realization of the stochastic
component in the magnetic ﬁeld (including random seed value)
to be the same with parameters (ni, nc) = (0.05, 0.0015). The
amplitude of the perturbation (wi) is constant in a column and
increases from left to right with values of ni = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3
and the correlation length (nc) is constant in a row and increases
from top to bottom with values of nc = 0.0005, 0.0010, 0.0015.
Comparison of Figs. 1 and 3 reveals, as expected, that the cou-
pling of structure perturbations to magnetic ﬁeld lead to signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerence in structures’ morphology as the wiggles are not
isotropic anymore. As a side eﬀect of our implementation of
the coupling between magnetic ﬁeld and matter density, struc-
tures may generally appear more aligned with the magnetic ﬁeld
than as imposed by the oﬀset angle ω, and may appear more
elongated than when turbulence is switched oﬀ. Both eﬀects are
in qualitative agreement with what MHD theory predicts (e.g.,
Brandenburg & Lazarian 2013).

2.2. Synthetic data: Input parameters

In this work, we want to study how the shape of ISM clouds and
their alignment with the ambient magnetic ﬁeld impact the mea-
sured polarization power spectra as well as to gauge the impor-
tance of the viewing angle. This goal, together with the require-
ment to observe sky patches covering at least one per cent of the
full sky (see next section), leads us to favour certain observer-OB
conﬁgurations within Asterion.

First, we want to study a portion of the ISM typical of the
intermediate-to-high Galactic latitude sky. Therefore, we select
a region placed at (l(cid:12), b(cid:12)) ≈ (180◦, 44◦) so that the entire ob-
served region, as seen from the Sun, is above latitude 30◦. We
want to resolve density structures at the pc scale and therefore
decide for an OB size of 200 pc (the voxels are 0.78 pc on a

Article number, page 6 of 16

side). To achieve an observed sky area of 1% of the full sky, the
circle deﬁned by the intersection of the observation cone and the
back side of the OB has to have an angular size of ≈ 25◦ and,
therefore, the center of the OB has to be placed at 350 pc from
the observer. The distance between the Sun and the OB is d(cid:12) ≈
370 pc and the observer will not be at Sun position.

Second, the fact that the observables returned by Asterion
reﬂect only the portion of the ISM that is encompassed by the
OB makes it possible to study the same ISM conﬁguration from
diﬀerent viewpoints. We take advantage of this feature to control
values of the inclination angle between the (regular) magnetic
ﬁeld orientation at the center of the OB and the line of sight
toward the center of the OB (the angle α in Eqs. 1 to 3). We
notice that in general α may vary across the outputs. The large-
scale regular magnetic ﬁeld model implements magnetic ﬁeld
lines following a logarithmic-spiral pattern with a constant pitch
angle of 28◦ and with zero out-of-plane component. Therefore,
we choose to place the observer at a height z = 257.1 pc (=
d(cid:12) sin(b(cid:12))) above the Galactic disk. We move the observer in this
plane while keeping the same distance to the OB center in order
to explore the eﬀect of the inclination angle on the observations.
In this case, all observations made by the observer are at latitude
0◦ and moving the observer around the OB changes the longitude
only. We sample the inclination angles from 90◦ (magnetic ﬁeld
in the plane of the sky) to 0◦ (magnetic ﬁeld along the line of
sight pointing to the center of the OB) with step of 15◦. The angle
that the main axes of the clouds make with the orientation of the
magnetic ﬁeld is the other parameter that we want to explore.
We vary this angle from 0 to 90◦ in 15◦ step. To allow us to
focus only on the eﬀects from the shape, the viewing angle and
the misalignment between structures and magnetic ﬁeld, we start
our study focusing on simulating data without the addition of the
stochastic component in the magnetic ﬁeld and the correlations
between density perturbations and magnetic ﬁeld. Another set
of synthetic maps is generated in Sect. 3.4 where we study the
eﬀects from those variables.

To decide on a default setting for the large number of free
parameters allowed by Asterion, we rely on observational con-
straints and on visual inspection of the resulting column density
maps so that the latter appear as realistic as possible.

First, according to Heiles & Troland (2003), we consider that
the CNM (the cloud structures) must account for 39% of the
gas mass and that the remaining 61% is attributed to the WNM
(the large-scale density distribution). Second, based on Spitzer
(1978), we consider that the particle number density in clouds
must be chosen randomly for each cloud in the range of 10 to 70
cm−3.

Following Heiles (1976), the typical length of clouds is ex-
pected to be around 20 pc with a width in an approximate ratio
of 10:1. We explored Asterion’s parameter space around those
values also varying the parameters describing the wiggles (the
ﬂuctuations in the density distribution within the clouds), and the
values or range of values of all parameters we choose are listed
in Table 1. The wiggle parameters are ﬁxed to the same values
for ﬁlaments and sheets. For ﬁlaments, the length is drawn from
a uniform random distribution in the range 7 to 25 pc while the
thickness varies uniformly from 1.5 to 4.5 pc. For sheets, the
length is drawn from a uniform random distribution in the range
from 5 to 20 pc, the width of the sheets takes random values in
the range from 10 to 20, and the thickness (the height) in the
range 1 to 3.

We adopt the observer-OB conﬁgurations presented above
together with the chosen settings for the cloud morphology and

generate 10 realizations of the magnetized ISM for each view
point by changing the random seed in Asterion. To summarize,
for both ﬁlaments and sheets, we explore seven values for the
inclination angle, seven values for the oﬀset angle (between the
structures’ main axis and the magnetic ﬁeld) and we generate
10 realizations for each couple of angles in order to infer the
variance induced by the positioning of the clouds and the scatter
from the speciﬁc choices of cloud size and shape and small-scale
ﬂuctuations. Therefore, we generate a set of 490 observations for
each. An example of I, Q and U polarization maps is shown in
Fig. 4 for clouds being ﬁlaments (top) or sheets (bottom) with
major axis aligned with the ambient magnetic ﬁeld lines; the lat-
ter making an angle of 90◦ with the line of sight for the ﬁlament
output and 60◦ for the sheet output. Since the magnetic ﬁeld runs
horizontally, most of the polarization signal is observed in posi-
tive Stokes Q.

However, given the large area of our output maps, some sig-
nal is also observed in Stokes U far from the center of the maps
because of projection eﬀects. Even for the case of a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld in the OB, the eﬀective inclination and position
angles of the magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the line of sight and
in the plane of the sky vary in the image. The smaller the incli-
nation angle, the larger the variation in the position angle.

The correlation between the power spectra T and B discussed in
Sect. 4 is also computed through the correlation coeﬃcient rT B
obtained by substituting E for B in Eq. 8. Additionally, visual
inspection of the power spectra informs us that most of the T T ,
EE and BB auto-power spectra present an apparent power-law
dependence in (cid:96) in the range (cid:96) ∈ [100, 500]. Consequently, we
decide to adjust a power-law power spectrum model of the form

2.3.2. Computation from synthetic maps

We use the Xpol code3 (Tristram et al. 2005) to compute the po-
larization power spectra of the dust polarized sky and account
for incomplete sky coverage. The reliability of Xpol at estimat-
ing polarization power spectra has been tested for sky area larger
or equal to one per cent of the full-sky4. This limit ﬁxes the mini-
mum angular size of the output that we generate using Asterion.
This choice, together with the spatial resolution that we want to
achieve in the OB, further sets the size of the OB and its distance
to the observer (see previous section).

In practice, we project Asterion’s outputs onto a full-sky
HEALPix map with resolution parameter Nside = 2048. Most
of the map is empty. We then deﬁne a circular mask of radius
11.5◦ centered on the outputs’ center. This choice allows us to
retain only the sky area that is free of artifacts from ray-tracing
the volume-limited cubic OB. The sightlines that are kept pass
through both the front and back faces of the OB, as seen by the
observer. To avoid power leakage we further apodize (smooth)
the mask using a 0.5 degree FWHM beam. This mask is applied
to Asterion’s outputs when projected on HEALPix map. The
eﬀective sky fraction of the mask ( fsky) is 1% of the full-sky.
Using Monte Carlo simulations we checked that our mask does
not introduce bias or leakage in the power spectrum estimation
following the same validation procedure as in (Pelgrims et al.
2022).

For the computation of the power spectra there are some
constraints imposed for the multipole moments. The maximum
value of (cid:96) is deﬁned by the eﬀective angular resolution achieved
in Asterion’s outputs. Visual inspection of several power spectra
informs us that above (cid:96) = 500 there is a sudden drop of power,
reﬂecting the eﬀects of the limited spatial resolution achieved in
the OB and the smoothing of density structure.

The threshold at low multipole values comes from uncertain-

ties in power spectrum estimation.

Since our synthetic maps do not contain observational noise,
we consider only the sampling variance as a source of uncer-
tainty in our power spectrum estimates. The latter is linked to
the number of unmasked pixels and their spatial arrangement on
the sky. The analytical estimate from the sampling variance is
given by (Planck Collaboration Int. XXX 2016):

C(cid:96)

(2(cid:96) + 1) fsky ∆(cid:96)bin

CXX
(cid:96)

,

(9)

where fsky and ∆(cid:96)bin are the sky fraction and the width of the
multipole bins used to estimate the power spectra, respectively.
We choose to reject power spectrum estimates for multipole (cid:96)
below 100 so as to ensure that C(cid:96)/σC(cid:96) ≥ 3 always.

To summarize, we use Xpol to estimate the polarization
power spectra from Asterion outputs in the multipole range
(cid:96) ∈ [100, 500] adopting bins of width 20. We compute the T T ,
EE, BB and T E spectra for every output of our sample and char-
acterize them through their REB and rT E values. An example of
such a set of polarization power spectra is shown in Fig. 4 along
with the corresponding polarization maps.

3. Analysis

In this section, we explore the dependence of the values of REB
and rT E with respect to (i) the oﬀset angle between the clouds’
long axes and the magnetic ﬁeld (ω) and (ii) the inclination angle
of the magnetic ﬁeld with the line of sight, for both ﬁlament-like
and sheet-like clouds. We vary both angles from 0◦ to 90◦ with
a step of 15◦. Since the exact values of REB and rT E depend
sensitively on the speciﬁc choice of parameters used to produce
the synthetic maps, we are primarily interested in the trends that
they exhibit as a function with ω and α.

3.1. REB and rT E dependence on ω
Here we infer the dependence of REB and rT E on the angle that
the major axes of the structure makes in three dimensions with
the local magnetic ﬁeld orientation.

We ﬁrst select the synthetic maps created with the magnetic
ﬁeld in the plane of the sky (α = 90◦) and we sort them according
to the oﬀset angle that the major axes of the structures make with
the local magnetic ﬁeld. In the top row of Fig. 5, we show the
dependence of REB (left) and rT E (right) as a function of ω, for
both shape families of clouds.

For ﬁlament-like clouds, we observe that REB as a function
of ω follows a parabolic trend starting from a maximum when
clouds’ major axes are perfectly aligned with the magnetic ﬁeld
(ω = 0◦), then decreases to reach a minimum toward ω = 45◦
and increases back for structures perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld (ω = 90◦). This trend reﬂects well the generally accepted
picture according to which E modes are maximized for struc-
tures perfectly parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld
whereas B modes dominate when (projected) linear structures
make an angle of 45◦ with it (e.g. Zaldarriaga 2001; Huﬀen-
berger et al. 2020; Clark et al. 2021). Obtaining this result, for
ﬁlaments, validates our modeling and analysis pipeline. Still for
ﬁlament-like clouds, we observe that rT E as a function of ω fol-
lows a decreasing squared-cosine trend, even showing negative
values for large oﬀset angles (ω ≥ 60◦). This trend is reminis-
cent of the result obtained for individual straight cylinders (Huf-
fenberger et al. 2020) and is understood by the same argument
as above. When E modes are reduced due to misalignment, the
corresponding E map systematically looses its correlation with
the T map. The two even get anti-correlated when the structures
are perpendicular to the ﬁeld since E modes become negative in
such a conﬁguration.

For sheet-like clouds, the same parabolic trend is recovered
for REB as a function of ω but with a smaller absolute diﬀerence
between the extrema than in the case of ﬁlament-like structures.
This is also true for the squared-cosine trend of rT E versus ω.
We understand these observations by the fact that sheets have
one additional degree of freedom in their orientation. The fact
that they could be seen either face-on, edge-on or with any in-
termediate angles, even though the orientation of their principal
axes is ﬁxed as compared to the magnetic ﬁeld orientation (here
parallel to it), has the eﬀect of reducing the imbalance between
E and B modes. Even in the case the sheets’ major axes are par-
allel to the magnetic ﬁeld, when projected on the sky, wiggles of
the sheet-like structures may show appreciable angles with the
magnetic ﬁeld lines, contributing to the production of B modes
rather than E modes. This reduces both the REB and rT E maxi-
mum values.

For both sheet- and ﬁlament-like structures, we observe that
the absolute diﬀerence between extrema in the trend of REB ver-
sus ω is reduced when the inclination angle decreases, for exam-
ple when the ﬁeld lines depart from the plane of the sky. This is
again understood by projection eﬀects and is further explored in
Sect. 3.2.

In the bottom row of Fig. 5, we show the scatter plots of rT E
versus REB obtained for ﬁlament-like clouds (left) and sheet-like
clouds (right), for all oﬀset and inclination angles. The scatter
plots are color-coded according to the oﬀset angles. These plots
oﬀer a diﬀerent and generalized view of the trends observed in
the top panels which were restricted to the case α = 90◦.

Particularly, for the case of ﬁlament-like clouds (left), we no-
tice a tail in high REB and rT E values which corresponds to small
oﬀset angles (ω (cid:46) 30◦). Then, as ω increases up to ≈ 45◦, both

the values of REB and rT E decrease forming a roundish cluster
centered on (REB, rT E) ≈ (1, 0.1). As structures’ major axes be-
come perpendicular to the ﬁeld, another smaller tail appears with
negative rT E and large REB values. This general picture is also
observed for sheet-like clouds (Fig. 5, bottom right panel) al-
though the scatter of the data points is larger; as expected due to
the increase of the degree of freedom. The comparison between
the 2D distributions of (REB, rT E) pairs obtained from ﬁlament-
and sheet-like clouds is further developed below.

3.2. REB and rT E dependence on α

Here we infer the dependence of the measured REB and rT E as
a function of the angle between the magnetic ﬁeld lines and the
line of sight.

We ﬁrst select the synthetic maps created with all the clouds
having their major axis parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld (ω = 0◦)
and we sort them according to the inclination angle of the ﬁeld
with respect to the line of sight. As in the previous subsection,
we have for each α value 10 realizations with ﬁlament-like and
sheet-like clouds of the same ISM volume that is observed from
seven diﬀerent observer positions (see Sect. 2.2). A diﬀerent set
of polarization power spectra corresponds to each realization. In
the top row of Fig. 6, we show the dependence of the correspond-
ing values of REB (left) and rT E (right) as a function of α.

For ﬁlament-like clouds, the viewing-angle and projection
eﬀects on REB and rT E are clearly shown. REB decreases follow-
ing a squared-sine trend from its maximum (at ≈ 1.8) obtained
for lines of sight perpendicular to the ﬁeld lines (α = 90◦) to
its minimum (at ≈ 1) obtained for lines of sight parallel to the
ﬁeld (α = 0◦). As for rT E, it also decreases from its maximum
when α ≈ 90◦ to zero when α ≈ 0◦ but following a sine trend.
For lines of sight and ﬁeld lines nearly parallel, the degree of
polarization is low and any small variations generate polariza-
tion with random orientations. This generates equal amounts of
E and B modes (thus REB ≈ 1) with no particular correlation
with intensity (thus rT E ≈ 0).

Similar trends are observed for sheet-like clouds with, how-
ever, much reduced diﬀerence between extrema. As before, we
interpret this reduction by the presence of wiggles and the extra
freedom in orientation that sheet-like structures allow for. The
maxima of both REB and rT E also do not appear for α = 90◦ but
at lower values ((cid:38) 60◦). We speculate that this peculiarity may
be related to projection eﬀects of the 3D structures.

In the bottom row of Fig. 6, we show the same scatter plots
as shown in the bottom row of Fig. 5 but color-coded by their
corresponding inclination angle values. We observe that the data
points corresponding to α = 90◦ draw a croissant-like pattern
(already outlined in the bottom panels of Fig. 5) in which REB is
maximized for ω = 0◦ and 90◦ and minimized for ω = 45◦, and
that is tighter for ﬁlament-like clouds than for sheet-like clouds.
Then, as α decreases, the distributions of (REB, rT E) pairs depart
from the croissant shape and become rounder with a center at
about (1, 0.1). The extreme cases are for α = 0◦ for which the
data points (all ω values included) show a very large scatter for
both ﬁlament-like and sheet-like clouds.

3.3. Ambiguity from the shapes of dust clouds

It is obvious that sheet-like structures may appear ﬁlament-like if
they are seen nearly edge-on, that is, if their minor axes is close
to the plane of the sky. Such an example is shown in Fig. 4. How-
ever, if dust clouds of the ISM are sheet-like rather than ﬁlament-

ω dependence of REB and rT E

Fig. 5. Dependence of REB and rT E values on ω, the misalignment angle between magnetic ﬁeld’s orientation and structures’ main axes for both
ﬁlament and sheet structures’ shapes. Top row shows REB (left) and rT E (right) versus ω for α = 90◦ for both ﬁlaments (blue) and sheets (orange).
The shaded areas include 68% of the data around the median (thick lines) obtained through 10 random realizations of the same setup. Bottom row
shows scatter plots of (REB, rT E) pairs for ﬁlaments (left) and sheets (right) color-coded according to the ω value and obtained for the complete
set of synthetic map. For visual reference, the black star in the bottom row indicate the ﬁducial Planck values (REB = 1.89, rT E = 0.36).

α dependence of REB and rT E

Fig. 6. Dependence of REB and rT E values on α, the angle that makes the magnetic ﬁeld lines with the line of sight. Top row shows REB (left)
and rT E (right) versus α for ω = 0◦ for both ﬁlaments (blue) and sheets (orange). Plotting conventions are the same as in Fig. 5 except that the
color-coded in the bottom row is according to α.

like structures, and given that generally the 3D orientation of
structures does not depend on the observer position (us), there is
no reason why all the minor axes of ISM clouds would lie in the
plane of the sky5. As a consequence, due to projection eﬀects,
ripples in the sheets may produce ﬁlament-like patterns (ridges)
uncorrelated with the projected orientation of the principal axes
of the sheets, or of the magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, this could in-
duce diﬀerent patterns in the polarization maps and therefore,
diﬀerent characteristics of the (polarization) power spectra.

We studied the dependence of the summarizing character-
istics of the polarization power spectra on the oﬀset angle and
on the inclination (viewing) angle for outputs generated out of
both, ﬁlament-like and sheet-like clouds. Beside the overall sim-
ilar trend observed for both shape types, we showed that sheet-
like structures lead to a generally looser correlation of the REB
and rT E values than ﬁlaments. This reﬂects the increase of degree
of freedom in the projected orientation of substructures in sheets
than in ﬁlaments. In addition, reaching simultaneously large REB
and large positive rT E values for sheets appears less common.
This increase of the possible ways to project a sheet on the sky
results in the reduction of the E to B power asymmetry and the
correlation between T and E.

However, despite these small diﬀerences, we ﬁnd that the
distributions of (REB, rT E) pairs from maps of ﬁlament-like and
sheet-like clouds largely overlap. This is best seen in Fig. 7
where we show contour plots of the distributions of points on
the (REB, rT E) plane for both shape categories on a same ﬁg-
ure. The three embedded contours enclose about 10, 70 and 90
per cent of the data points. The overlap is striking and the larger
scatter of data points from outputs made out of sheet-like clouds
is evident.

Figure 7 makes it clear that the shape of the cloud structures
cannot be distinguished by the unique consideration of the REB
and rT E values. The observation of an (REB, rT E) pair appears
almost as likely coming from either family of shapes. This is
even more true if one relaxes the constraints of the morphology
(axis ratios) and size of the clouds, which we have kept ﬁxed in
this study (see Sect. 2.2).

Aside from the REB and rT E characteristics, power spectra of
outputs made from ﬁlaments and sheet-like structures are simi-
lar. This can already be inferred from the right column of Fig. 4
where, for those examples, it is seen that amplitudes and slopes
of spectra have similar values. This is better demonstrated in
Fig. 8 where we present histograms of the spectral indices of
power-law ﬁts to the auto-power spectrum of E and B modes,
for ﬁlament (left) and sheet-like (right) clouds. No substantial
diﬀerence can be spotted between cloud shapes.

Based on these considerations, we argue that interpreting po-
larization power spectra solely in terms of ﬁlament characteris-
tics and their relationship to the ambient magnetic ﬁeld, is risky
because of this degeneracy on the intrinsic shape of the clouds.

3.4. Turbulent ISM and magnetic ﬁeld

ing to the polarization maps used in the analysis so far are some-
what unrealistic in the sense that they lack known physics. In
our model, the orientations of density caustics and magnetic ﬁeld

5 We note that even in the scenario where the Sun is embedded in the
Local Bubble and the magnetic ﬁeld lines follow the surface of the shell
of the Local Bubble (as discussed in Sect. 4), it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd a
physical argument that would make the minor axes of all the sheets to
lie in the plane of the sky.

are not correlated at small scales although we expect them to be,
at least to some extent, due to ﬂux-freezing (Heiles & Crutcher
2005). These simple, but non-trivial simulations have allowed us
to study in detail the dependence of the summary characteristics
of the polarization power spectra on the inclination angle, the
oﬀset angle and the type of dust cloud morphology. Here, we
want to study the eﬀects of coupling density structures to a non-
regular magnetic ﬁeld on our results. To do so, we exploit the
possibility in Asterion to add a stochastic component to the reg-
ular magnetic ﬁeld and to generate density perturbations along
the local (perturbed) magnetic ﬁeld lines (see Sect. 2.1.6). Ex-
ample of outputs obtained with such coupling were presented
in Figs. 2 and 3 for Stokes Q maps and K maps, respectively.
For the purpose of our analysis we ﬁx the parameters for the
stochastic component in magnetic ﬁeld and for the coupled wig-
gles such that (i) the outputs are visually similar to the dust po-
larization sky at high-Galactic latitudes and (ii) the characteris-
tics of polarization power spectra of maps made out of ﬁlaments
are close to observed values when ω = 0◦ and α = 90◦. This
choice, leads to the set of parameters (ni, nc) = (0.05, 0.0015)
and (wi, wc) = (0.2, 0.001) which we do not change while ex-
ploring the eﬀect from varying the ω and α angles as in Sect. 3.

REB

With those values we notice that generally the simulated den-
sity structures coupled to the magnetic ﬁeld show their eﬀec-
tive major axes more aligned with the local mean magnetic ﬁeld
(ωeﬀ (cid:46) 45◦) than set by the input ω values. This is a desirable
feature motivated by observational evidences that clouds of the
diﬀuse ISM, both HI ﬁbers and dust clouds, tend to be preferen-
tially aligned with the ambient magnetic ﬁeld (McClure-Griﬃths
et al. 2006; Clark et al. 2014; Clark et al. 2015; Martin et al.
2015; Planck Collaboration Int. XXXII 2016; Planck Collabora-
tion Int. XXXV 2016; Planck Collaboration Int. XXXVIII 2016;
Soler 2019). As a result, and as illustrated in Fig. A.1, we ﬁnd
that REB remains globally larger than unity and rT E remains pos-
itive while varying ω. This is the case for both cloud shapes.
Comparing Figs. A.1 and A.2 with Figs. 5 and 6, we ﬁnd that
the diﬀerent scalings present for the range ω (cid:38) 30◦ are severely
attenuated, if not suppressed, when density structures are cou-
pled to the magnetic ﬁeld and that REB and rT E values of outputs
from sheet-like structures are in general closer to outputs from
ﬁlament-like structures. The main eﬀects of coupling the density
perturbations and the magnetic ﬁeld is that 2D distributions of
REB and rT E from the two types of shapes do overlap even more
than in the absence of such coupling and that negative rT E values
are much less frequent. This is clearly seen in Fig. 9.

4. Discussion

In this paper we do not attempt to model the actual dust polariza-
tion sky observed at submillimeter wavelengths, for example by
Planck at 353 GHz. Rather, our focus is to explore whether the
assumed shape of the ISM clouds may lead to erroneous conclu-
sions in the interpretation of dust polarization power spectra.

In order to model the dust polarization sky and in particular
the measured polarization power spectra, it would be necessary
to sample a large volume of the Galactic space with our OB,
generating a 3D mosaic, possibly in a way similar to what has
been proposed by Hervías-Caimapo et al. (2021). However, our
analysis shows that the viewing angle -with which the portion of
the ISM is observed- is signiﬁcant in determining the ratio and
correlation between power spectrum modes. We ﬁnd an extra de-
pendence on α than that proposed by Huﬀenberger et al. (2020)
for rT E only. Our results make it clear that the overall geomet-
rical arrangement of the magnetized ISM surrounding the ob-
server (us) leaves its marks on the power spectra and in particular
on the REB and rT E parameters. We see it unlikely that the ge-
ometry dependence averages out when considering large swaths

Article number, page 12 of 16

of the sky. This is reinforced by the fact that all viewing angles
are not equally likely, especially at high Galactic latitudes. The
reason is that the Sun sits in the Local Bubble, a cavity of hot
plasma that was presumably created by supernova explosions,
which is surrounded by a shell of cold neutral gas and dust with
a radius between 100 to 300 pc, depending on observation direc-
tion. The polarized signal observed in the polar caps (|b| > 60◦)
is dominated by the emission from the shell of the Local Bubble
(Skalidis & Pelgrims 2019). The formation of this structure has
shaped the local, magnetized ISM surrounding the Sun (Alves
et al. 2018; Pelgrims et al. 2020) and has left the magnetic ﬁeld
to lie mostly in the plane of the sky at high |b| but may show
strong departures in some places (Pelgrims et al. 2020). In light
of the highlighted α-dependence that we ﬁnd, we caution that
the exact morphology of the magnetic ﬁeld in regions dominat-
ing the polarization signal needs to be accounted for to model
large areas of the sky. This would involve the production of 3D
mosaics, and the computation of polarization power spectra to be
compared to actual observations. This is a highly complex task,
which is beyond the scope of this paper.

Recently, Pelgrims et al. (2022) showed from maps synthe-
sized from Galaxy-sized MHD simulations that the speciﬁc ob-
server location has a strong eﬀect on the characterization of the
polarization power spectra. In light of our results, it would be in-
teresting to ﬁgure out how much of the reported variance can be
attributed to the peculiar 3D geometry of the part of the magnetic
ﬁeld that is imprinted in maps and thus, in power spectra.

On the other hand, Bracco et al. (2019b) have studied po-
larization power spectra from Planck data at intermediate-to-low
Galactic latitudes in sky patches of the same size as ours. They
found that the REB and rT E parameters span large ranges of val-
ues. With our toy-model simulation-based study we show that
a signiﬁcant source of scatter in those quantities may actually
come from the geometrical arrangement of the magnetized ISM,
in addition to the scatter that may arise from the fact that the oﬀ-
set angle in diﬀerent clouds is probably not constant but rather
follows some distribution (see e.g., Huﬀenberger et al. 2020).
Our toy-models, however, cannot be simply compared to the re-
sults of their observational study since our synthetic maps do not
account for the full cone of observation, which becomes impor-
tant at low latitudes, and also because they pre-processed the po-
larization sky maps in order to get rid of the large-scale Galactic
gradient. We do not know how this processing aﬀects their re-
sults.

Furthermore, in an attempt to model the actual sky, it would
probably be relevant to consider that dust clouds can be de-
scribed by a mixed population of sheet-like and ﬁlament-like
structures with varying axis ratios. In this study, we did not ex-
plore such a possibility because we want to quantify the possible
cloud-shape degeneracy of the REB and rT E values.

Currently, our results are limited by the achieved spatial res-
olution that is ﬁxed by the minimum angular size of the sky patch
that Xpol can handle, and the size of Asterion grid (2563). We
achieve a spatial resolution of ∼ 0.78 pc which is more than
twice the thickness obtained for actual sheet clouds of the neu-
tral ISM ((cid:46) 0.3 pc according to Kalberla et al. 2016).

Another source of limitation of our study comes from the
limited portion along distance that is mapped. This reduces the
number of structures that appear on our maps as compared to real
observations. This does not aﬀect our analysis since our main re-
sults relate to the (relative) comparison of power spectrum char-
acteristics between (i) diﬀerent cloud shapes, (ii) diﬀerent oﬀset
angles, and (iii) diﬀerent inclination angles.

Besides the special attention paid to the E/B power asym-
metry and the correlation between T and E modes which were
detected with high signiﬁcance in dust polarization maps from
Planck, a more marginal signal has been reported between the T
and B modes (Planck Collaboration Int. XXX 2016; Planck Col-
laboration XI 2020). Other recent studies (Weiland et al. 2020;
Clark et al. 2021) relied on a more accurate version of the Planck
data and on external data sets to prove that the weak positive T B
signal (a mark of parity violation in the dust polarization sky) is
a real property of the Galactic emission and infer its origin.

A detailed study of the eﬀect of cloud morphology on the
T B signal (e.g., Bracco et al. 2019a) and a careful analysis of
the dependence on ω and α along with the scale dependence of
the signal is not the focus of this paper and we postpone this to
future work. Meanwhile, we show in Fig. 10, that the correlation
coeﬃcient rT B between T and B modes measured from ﬁlament-
like or sheet-like structures does not strongly diﬀer, at least when
the scatter from varying ω and or α is taken into account. All
distributions are centered on zero and, as with REB and rT E, we
ﬁnd that sheet-like structures lead to broader distributions than
ﬁlament-like structures do.

5. Conclusions

The search for the primordial B modes in the polarization of
CMB radiation calls for the understanding and characterization
of the Galactic foregrounds in order to disentangle their contri-
bution to the maps of the polarized sky.

In this project, we investigated whether the morphology of
the dust clouds has an impact on the statistical characterization
of the polarized emission. We simulated interstellar clouds with
ﬁlament-like and sheet-like shapes and produced corresponding
synthetic polarization maps, using the software Asterion. Then,
we computed their polarization power spectra in multipole range
(cid:96) ∈ [100, 500] and we focused our study on the power asymme-
try between E and B modes, and on the cross correlation between
T and E modes, through the parameters REB and rT E, respec-
tively. We explored the dependence of REB and rT E on the in-
clination angle (α, between magnetic ﬁeld and the line of sight),
and the oﬀset angle (ω, between the longest cloud axis and the
magnetic ﬁeld) for both types of shape. Our study provides im-
portant insights on the interpretation of the polarization power
spectra of dust polarization in terms of ISM properties and could

help in the characterization of Galactic foregrounds to the CMB
polarization.

Our results for ﬁlaments are consistent with theoretical pre-
dictions and observations. For ﬁlamentary structures aligned
with the magnetic ﬁeld (ω ≈ 0◦), something that seems to be true
in nature for the diﬀuse ISM, the power ratio REB can be as large
as ∼ 2, in agreement with Planck measurements (e.g., Planck
Collaboration Int. XXX 2016). Moreover, for regular magnetic
ﬁeld and large inclination angles, where polarization is maxi-
mized, E-mode power of structures is maximized for oﬀset an-
gles ω = 0◦ and 90◦ and B-mode power is maximized for ω =
45◦. This behaviour is in agreement with theoretical expectations
Zaldarriaga (2001) and previous studies (Rotti & Huﬀenberger
2019; Huﬀenberger et al. 2020). As a result, REB as a function of
ω draws a parabola with minimum at ω ≈ 45◦, where B modes
slightly dominate E modes. In parallel, the correlation coeﬃ-
cient rT E goes from its maximum at ω = 0◦ to its minimum at
ω = 90◦. These trends (with little variance from speciﬁc ISM
realizations) are similarly observed for other inclination angle
values, though with lower diﬀerence between extrema as α de-
creases.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that an
analysis of polarization power spectra obtained from sheet-like
interstellar clouds has been performed. We found that the param-
eters REB and rT E measured from maps made from sheet-like
structures show similar trends as a function of ω and α angles to
those observed for ﬁlaments. However, the amplitude between
extrema is generally smaller and the variance with respect to the
speciﬁc ISM realizations is larger. We understood these charac-
teristics in terms of the extra degree of freedom that sheet-like
structures possess related to the orientation of their corrugations
with the long axis.

Varying only the inclination and oﬀset angles, we found that
sheet-like structures and ﬁlament-like structures lead to polar-
ization power spectra that cannot be distinguished in the plane
of (REB, rT E) parameters.

Consequently, we argued that measured REB and rT E val-
ues cannot be used alone to discriminate among characteristics
of ISM structures and that this degeneracy should be accounted
for in the interpretation and modeling of observational data. We
checked that our main conclusions remain valid when a stochas-
tic component is added to the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld and,
most importantly, when density structure perturbations are added
such that the orientations of density caustics and magnetic ﬁeld
are correlated at small scales as we expect them to be due to
MHD physics.

Our analysis also highlights and quantiﬁes the dependence of
the E/B asymmetry and T E correlation on the inclination angle,
a dependence that is changed by the inclusion of ﬂuctuations in
the magnetic ﬁeld lines and their coupling to density perturba-
tions but that preserves its signiﬁcance. This strongly suggests
that the geometrical arrangement of the large scale magnetic
ﬁeld as viewed by the observer is a critical factor shaping po-
larization power spectra.

This was already suggested by Bracco et al. (2019a) and
could explain the large scatter on REB and rT E values observed
from diﬀerent sky patches (Bracco et al. 2019b) and the strong
cosmic variance reported from MHD simulation-based studies
(Kim et al. 2019; Pelgrims et al. 2022).

Finally, and for completeness, we also examined the corre-
lation coeﬃcient between the T and B modes (rT B) and observe
that this feature of the power spectrum cannot be used to discrim-
inate cloud shape types either. Instead, we ﬁnd that variation in

ω and α generates signiﬁcant dispersion in the values of rT B.
Further work will be needed to investigate the possible scale de-
pendence of the T B signal as reported by real sky observation of
dust polarization.

Figures A.1 and A.2 show the main results obtained when we
consider our simple implementation to account for density struc-
tures correlated to non-regular magnetic ﬁeld, that is, to mimic
basic eﬀects expected from MHD physics. These ﬁgures are ob-
tained following the very same procedure as Figs. 5 and 6 ob-
tained with a uniform magnetic ﬁeld permeating the OB.

ω dependence of REB and rT E

Fig. A.1. Same as for Fig. 5 but for when a 3D vector noise is added to the regular magnetic ﬁeld and the wiggles of density structures are
constrained to follow the local magnetic ﬁeld lines.
