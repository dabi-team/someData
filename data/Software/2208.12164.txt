SYSTEMATIC MAPPING PROTOCOL 
ESTIMATION ACCURACY OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS USING AGILE METHODOLOGIES 

1. Introduction 

There  are  techniques  and  tools  to  estimate  software  project  effort,  such  as  function  point 
estimation, use case point estimation, COCOMO and COCOMO II, comparison estimation, PMI-PRM, 
among others. They are based on the estimation of different variables [1] that, in the case of fuzzy 
techniques, they are linguistic quantifiers for many or most of their variables [2][3][4]. In many cases 
the  experts’  opinion  is  essential  [5].  Regarding  risk  analysis,  the  experts’  contribution  is  crucial, 
especially on the risk hierarchy definition, and the probabilities of occurrence.   

Just  the  fourth  part  of  software  projects  succeed  in  terms  of  completion  according  to  what  is 
planned, estimated, and specified [6]. At the same time, IT projects nature creates a great number 
of  risks  [7].  A  great  percentage  of  projects  that  do  not  reach  success  is  due  to  incorrect  effort 
estimation of and wrong or none risk categorization [8]. 

Our interest on this work is to identify and categorize the estimation techniques and tools employed 
on software development projects using agile methodologies. On this matter, the main goal is to 
represent  a  state  of  the  application  of  these  techniques  and  tools  emphasizing  on  the  existing 
evidence about its effort estimation accuracy. 

Through Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE), it is expected to transform the information 
need into a question that may be answered, establishing the evidence to answer that question, and 
therefore critically assessing evidence to determine its validity [9]. Kitchenham et al. state that EBSE 
has  the  intention  "to  provide  the  means  by  which  current  best  evidence  from  research  can  be 
integrated with practical experience and human values in the decision-making process regarding 
the development and maintenance of software" [9]. The present document describes the planning 
phase of a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS), used to organize the research field findings, based on 
Petersen et al. [10] recommendations.  

The rest of the article is organized as follows: the research method is described in Section 2, the 
strategy to mitigate threats to validity is presented in Section 3 and, finally, we offer our conclusions 
in Section 4.

2.2. Search strategy and study selection 

The search strategy selected includes three approaches to look for primary studies. The first one is 
a manual search on Google Scholar of literature systematic revisions about software estimations on 
agile  methodologies.  The  second  is  an  automatic  search  made  through  the  on-line  sources  of 
scientific study (digital libraries and databases). Finally, the set of studies will be completed using 
the forward snowballing technique [11]. Figure 1 shows this strategy. 

Figure 1. Search and selection process 

The activities are as follows: 

Activity #1: Perform manual search 
A manual search on Google Scholar has been planned in order to obtain similar works to ours, 
according  to  Petersen  et  al.  [12]  recommendation,  as  it  will  also  help  to  adjust  the  study 
approach.   

Activity #2: Identify related works 
The existing works about effort estimation in agile methodologies will be identified. Since we are 
performing a SMS, a secondary study, just other secondary works previously published will be 
considered as related works (SMS or SLR - Systematic Literature Review).

Activity #3: Select the sources 
The electronic databases of scientific articles selected for this study are Scopus, IEEE Xplore and 
the ACM digital library, as they are repeatedly quoted at SMS reports and guidelines [13] [14] 
[15] [16].  

Activity #4: Design the search string for each source 
The search strings that will be used for the three mentioned libraries are indicated in Table 3.

OR “extreme programming”)) AND Keyword:((estim* OR predic*))) 
OR (Abstract:((agil* OR ágil OR scrum OR kanban OR scrumban OR xp 
OR “extreme programming”)) AND Abstract:((estim* OR predic*)))  

Activity #5: Run the searches 
The searches will be executed, and the results collected. These results will include duplicates that 
will have to be discarded by applying the following rules: 

a.  Extended works: preserve the last one. 
b.  Duplicated works: depending on the source, follow this order: Scopus (as it offers more 
detailed information), followed by IEEE Xplore and, lastly, ACM DL (because it does not 
recover the abstracts) [17]. 

Activity #6: Distribute the studies 
The studies recovered will be distributed into four researchers as shown in table 4. Note that it 
is ensured that each work is examined by two different researchers in order to reduce biases.

The individual selection of studies carried out by each researcher will be included into a unique 
set of studies. 

Activity #7: Apply exclusion criteria 
The  researchers  will  independently  revise  the  studies  that  have  been  assigned  and  they  will 
decide if they are relevant or not, just by reading the title, abstract and by applying the exclusion 
criteria (EC). This criterion is described in table 6.

Activity #9: Run snowballing 
The resulting articles will be considered as “seed works” to be used on a forward snowballing 
technique,  following  the  guidelines  proposed  by  Wohlin  [11].  The  reason  to  execute  this 
complementary search has as a goal to enrich the automatic search results.  

Activity #10: Apply exclusion criteria 
An expert will apply the exclusion criteria to the new resulting articles from the previous activity, 
therefore the definitive set of articles is obtained, which will be named as “selected articles” (SA). 

2.3. Data extraction forms 

The relevant data will be extracted from the set of studies in order to answer the eight RQ and the 
three PQ. The data will be stored on a spreadsheet with the format shown in table 7 and in table 8.

3. Threats to validity 

Hereunder, the mitigation actions that have been expected are presented in order to reduce the 
impact of validity threats, categorized by Petersen [10], that could affect the study: 

Descriptive validity 

This validity aims to ensure that the observations are objectively and precisely described.  

•  The information to be collected has been organized by means of a pair of data extraction 

forms, for RQs and PQs, presented in Table 7 and Table 8 to support a uniform data register 
and objectify the data extraction process. 

•  Furthermore, all researchers will participate at an initial meeting, in order to standardize 
concepts and criteria, answer to any question and show (through examples) how to carry 
out the data extraction process. 
In addition, the data extraction form will also be published.  

• 

Theoretical validity 

The theoretical validity depends on the capacity to obtain the information intended to get.  

• 

It will start with a search string (Table 3) adapted to the three most popular digital libraries 
about computer science and software engineering online databases. 

•  An expert will provide a set of articles to verify if they are retrieved with the search string.  
•  A set of exclusion criteria has been defined (Table 6) to objectify the selection process.  
•  The studies will be distributed among four researchers, working independently and a 
study superposition ensuring that each of the studies is verified at least by two 
researchers (Table 4). 

•  Two different research methods will be combined: an automatic search and a manual 
search (snowball forward), to reduce the risk of not finding all the available evidence.  

Generalizability 

This validity is related to the capacity to generalize the results to the whole domain.  

•  The RQ set is sufficiently general to identify and classify the findings about estimation 

techniques on agile software development methodologies, independent of specific cases, 
the type of industry, etc. [12]. 

•  The initial search of similar works will collaborate with the definition of generalized RQ. 

Interpretive validity 

This validity is achieved when the conclusions are reasonable considering the data.   

•  At least two researchers will validate each conclusion. 
•  Two researchers, with experience on the issue domain, will help with the data 

interpretation.

ESTIMATION ACCURACY OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS USING AGILE METHODOLOGIES 

Repeatability 

The research process must be detailed enough in order to ensure a thorough repetition. 

•  This protocol has been designed detailed enough as to allow the repetition of the process 

that has been followed.  

•  The protocol, as well as the study results, will be published online so that other 

researchers are able to replicate the process and confirm the results.  

4. Conclusions 

Regarding the SMS process, the guidelines published by Petersen [10] have been strictly followed 
to plan, conduct, and report a SMS. Considering that the tasks to be carried out, presented in this 
protocol, adhere to these guidelines, it is believed that the execution phase (conducting the SMS) 
will  be  repeatable,  and  the  validity  threats  will  have  been  reduced  as  much  as  possible,  at  fully 
acceptable levels. 

Regarding the objective of the SMS, we believe that, by following this protocol, it will be successfully 
achieved. The results we hope to find with this study will help out in a better selection of estimation 
methods in agile methodologies, in addition to providing solid evidence for other related studies.
