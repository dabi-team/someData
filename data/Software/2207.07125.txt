ABSTRACT

We present a set of multi-wavelength mosaics and photometric catalogs in the ALMA lensing cluster
survey (ALCS) ﬁelds. The catalogs were built by reprocessing of archival data from the CHArGE
compilation, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) in the RELICS, CLASH and Hubble Frontier
Fields. Additionally we have reconstructed the Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 µm mosaics, by utilising
all the available archival IRSA/SHA exposures. To alleviate the eﬀect of blending in such a crowded
region, we have modelled the Spitzer photometry by convolving the HST detection image with the
Spitzer PSF using the novel golfir software. The ﬁnal catalogs contain 218,000 sources, covering a
combined area of 690 arcmin2. These catalogs will serve as an important tool in aiding the search of
the sub-mm galaxies in future ALMA surveys, as well as follow ups of the HST dark - IRAC sources.
Coupled with the available HST photometry the addition of the 3.6 and 4.5 µm bands will allow us to
place a better constraint on photometric redshifts and stellar masses of these objects, thus giving us an
opportunity to identify high-redshift candidates for spectroscopic follow ups and answer the important
questions regarding the epoch of reionization and formation of ﬁrst galaxies.

1. INTRODUCTION

The emergence of large multi-wavelength photomet-
ric surveys has allowed us to conduct detailed studies of
galaxy formation and evolution across cosmic time by
observing statistically signiﬁcant population of galaxies.
In particular, the investment of thousands of orbits of
Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) and Spitzer Space Tele-
scope (Spitzer ) time has cemented their unprecedented
imaging legacy and enabled us to revolutionize our un-
derstanding of both observational cosmology and galaxy
evolution. Compared to ground based observations, the
data taken in space do not suﬀer from the distortion
and absorption eﬀects of the atmosphere, thus achiev-
ing remarkable sensitivity and wavelength coverage. For
example, these unique capabilities allowed us to capture
the accelerating expansion of the Universe (Riess et al.
2004), and have helped demonstrate that the majority
of star formation took place within a relatively short
time span, in the epoch at 1 < z < 3 (see e.g. Hopkins
& Beacom 2006; Bouwens et al. 2007).

More recently, the advantages of space-based observa-
tions have become particularly pronounced in the search
for high redshift galaxies, with the combined eﬀorts of
the very sensitive WFC3/IR camera onboard HST and
the ultra deep Spitzer /IRAC imaging. The remarkable
wavelength coverage of these instruments has helped
us push the observational frontier to the beginning of
the cosmic epoch of reionization at z ∼ 7 − 8, some
700 Myr from the Big Bang, and toward the epoch be-
yond z ∼ 10, where the formation of the ﬁrst galaxies

has taken place. A number of large deep extragalactic
blank ﬁeld surveys has now led to a discovery of signiﬁ-
cant and statistically meaningful number of galaxies at
z ∼ 7 − 8 (e.g. McLure et al. 2013; Finkelstein et al.
2015; Bouwens et al. 2015), an ever growing sample of
z ∼ 9−11 candidates (Ellis et al. 2013; Oesch et al. 2013,
2014; Bouwens et al. 2016; Calvi et al. 2016), and even
the most distant galaxy discovered to-date at z = 11.1
(Oesch et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2021). The most stag-
gering and impactful discoveries of high-z galaxies have
however been made within lensing cluster ﬁelds, which
include Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF; Lotz et al. 2017),
the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS; Coe
et al. 2019), and the Cluster Lensing And Supernova
survey with Hubble (CLASH; Postman et al. 2012). All
three combine the power of HST and Spitzer observa-
tions and a strong gravitational lensing potential of mas-
sive galaxy clusters, to produce the deepest available
observations of high-z galaxies lensed by clusters ever
obtained (e.g. see Zheng et al. 2012; Coe et al. 2013;
Bradley et al. 2014; Schmidt et al. 2014; Zitrin et al.
2014; Infante et al. 2015; Ishigaki et al. 2015; Kawa-
mata et al. 2015; Oesch et al. 2015; McLeod et al. 2015;
Hashimoto et al. 2018; Hoag et al. 2018; Strait et al.
2020).

The redshift estimates of these objects still largely
rely on spectral energy distribution (SED) ﬁtting of
broad-band restframe UV+optical photometry from
HST /WFC3 and Spitzer /IRAC, and spectroscopically
conﬁrmed samples of high-z candidates remain lim-

ited. The SED ﬁtting photometric redshift technique
is largely leveraged on the correct identiﬁcations of ei-
ther the Lyman or Balmer breaks, at 912 ˚A and 3640 ˚A
respectively, in the stellar continuum. At z ∼ 9 − 10 the
Spitzer /IRAC targets the ∼ 3000 − 4000 ˚A rest frame
continuum and as such can greatly aid in removing the
low-redshift interlopers from the high-z samples. More-
over, even for spectroscopically conﬁrmed objects the
Spitzer observations are essential for conducting robust
measurements of the stellar population parameters, such
as stellar mass (M∗), dust attenuated star formation
rate (SFR), and extinction (AV ) (Gonz´alez et al. 2011;
Ryan et al. 2014; Salmon et al. 2015). The existing
data has already lead to implications that the ﬁrst star-
formation has taken place ∼ 250 Myr after the Big Bang
(Hashimoto et al. 2018).

Some questions regarding star formation, are how-
ever yet to be answered. From the rest-frame UV and
FIR observations conducted during the last decade (Le
Floc’h et al. 2005, 2009) we know that star formation ac-
tivity in Universe was more substantial in the past, than
it is now. Tracing the evolution of the volume-weighted
SFR - the SFR density (SFRD) with time, presents us
with a view of the Universe where the star formation has
already reached its peak at z ∼ 2 − 3 and is now declin-
ing (e.g. Madau & Dickinson 2014; Zavala et al. 2021).
Studies of the SFRD also show a growing disparity be-
tween the contribution of dust obscured SFR, measured
from the IR data, and the unobscured SFR, measured
from the UV - optical data. On one hand, observations
with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Ar-
ray (ALMA), such as the MORA project (Casey et al.
2021; Manning et al. 2022), suggest that, as we move
towards higher-z, the SFR becomes dominated by un-
obscured SFR, primarily through UV - selected galaxies.
This, in return, might imply that the early Universe was
less dusty, aligning with some of our predictions regard-
ing the time-scale and mechanisms of dust production.
On the other hand, blind ALMA studies of galaxies at
z ∼ 2−6 (Wang et al. 2016, 2019; Yamaguchi et al. 2019;
Gruppioni et al. 2020; Umehata et al. 2020; Manning
et al. 2022; Sun et al. 2022) reveal a population of op-
tically dark, dusty sources, which contribute ten times
more towards the SFRD, than similarly bright galax-
ies with a rest-frame UV detection, and reside within
centres of the most massive matter overdensities (Zhou
et al. 2021). The ubiquity of such systems, can poten-
tially create obstacles in our understanding of the true
numbers of massive galaxies and SFRD in the early Uni-
verse. In addition to that, the existence of high num-
ber of massive, evolved, and dusty sources only a few
billion years after the Big Bang challenges our current

understanding of galaxy formation. Moreover, there are
implications that the optically dark galaxies that we see
at z > 3 could also potentially act as the progenitors
of bright central galaxies (BCGs) within galaxy clusters
(Umehata et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016, 2019; Umehata
et al. 2019; Fudamoto et al. 2021). As a result, our abil-
ity to correctly recover the total SFR comes down to
the detection of high-z dusty galaxies, such as “HST -
dark”, or optically dark sources.

The complete dust obscuration of UV-optical emis-
sion, makes the detection and identiﬁcation of these
objects a signiﬁcant challenge, even when suﬃcient
MIR and FIR coverage are available. The brightest,
most massive optically dark sources can be detected
by Spitzer /IRAC, however poor resolution can result
in blending and erroneous assignment of ﬂux density if
nearby objects are present (e.g. see works by Sun et al.
2021; Shu et al. 2022). The obscuration of the UV - opti-
cal continuum emission in “HST - dark” sources makes
it impossible to directly compute the stellar mass, and
derive metallicity from the optical lines. It also renders
any photometric redshift technique unfeasible, with the
spectral line scan remaining as the only option to reli-
ably secure redshifts. As a result the only reliable way to
observe such objects are blind ﬁeld studies with ALMA
or the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA).
ALMA in particular, has been the primary tool
driving the discovery of new faint sub-mm galaxies,
(S1.2mm ∼ 0.02 − 1 mJy), which are substantially fainter
compared to the traditionally observed sub-mm galax-
ies (SMGs) (see e.g. Hatsukade et al. 2013, 2016; Ono
et al. 2014; Carniani et al. 2015; Oteo et al. 2016; Fu-
jimoto et al. 2016; Aravena et al. 2016; Dunlop et al.
2017; Gonz´alez-L´opez et al. 2017; Franco et al. 2018; Sun
et al. 2022. Despite such depths, the origin of the cosmic
infrared background (CIB), and therefore the majority
of SFRD still remains hidden, with the signiﬁcant dis-
crepancy between the faint-end of mm number counts.
Over the last few years, ALMA observations of faint 1.2
mm sources have been able to derive ALMA mm counts
down to depths of ∼ 0.02 mJy (Carniani et al. 2015;
Fujimoto et al. 2016; Hatsukade et al. 2016; Aravena
et al. 2016), and even further down to 0.013 mJy, in the
Hubble Frontier Fields (Mu˜noz Arancibia et al. 2018).
All of these studies have managed to roughly account,
and discretize, between 15 – 50 % of total CIB con-
tribution. It has quickly become apparent that deeper
ALMA observations are absolutely imperative in order
to separate and resolve the remained of the CIB into
discrete sources, in order to study their individual prop-
erties. The most eﬃcient way to complete this puzzle is

4

Kokorev et al.

to observe a suﬃciently large number of lensing clusters
using ALMA.

The ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS) aims to
do exactly that. At the moment, it is the largest, by
area, among other ALMA surveys targeting clusters of
galaxies. Combined with previous ALMA observations,
the survey covers a total of 33 massive galaxy clus-
ters. The primary goals of ALCS are: (1) Examine the
faint-end slope of 1.2 mm source counts, (2) Explore
the types of galaxies responsible for the faint sub-mm
emission in lensed ﬁelds, (3) Study the redshift distribu-
tion of the faint sub-mm population, (4) Constraining
the ionised carbon (CII) and carbon monoxide (CO) lu-
minosity functions from the observed spectral lines, (5)
Calculate the mm-properties of diﬀerent types of star-
forming galaxies, and perform stacking analysis in case
of non-detections (e.g. Fujimoto et al. 2021; Laporte
et al. 2021; Jolly et al. 2021).

All of these objectives however require additional
data,
in order to derive photometric redshifts, and
relevant physical parameters. Fortunately, all ALCS
clusters have been previously imaged with HST, and
Spitzer /IRAC, enabling accurate positions and other
quantities derived from the photometry.
In this work
we describe the re-processing of all archival HST, and
Spitzer /IRAC mosaics, covering the ALCS. We perform
careful aperture photometry of all HST sources, and use
them as priors to model and ﬁt the ﬂux densities for the
sources in the blended IRAC maps. The ﬁnal images
and catalogs will then act as a powerful tool to establish
better constraints on photometric redshifts and physical
properties of these objects. In addition, this allows us to
identify high-redshift candidates for spectroscopic follow
ups and answer the important questions regarding the
epoch of reionization and formation of ﬁrst galaxies.

The provided catalogs1 include HST and Spitzer pho-
tometry, photometric redshifts, and stellar population
properties, for each ﬁeld included in ALCS (similarly
to the ASTRODEEP collaboration Merlin et al. (2016);
Di Criscienzo et al. (2017) and the HFF-DeepSpace cat-
alogs Shipley et al. (2018), albeit following a diﬀerent
methodology). Moreover, the public release of our data
is complemented by all the new HST /ACS, HST /WFC3
and IRAC mosaics, including detection images, models,
residuals and segmentation maps.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we list
the data sets used in this work, and describe the creation
of new Spitzer /IRAC mosaics. In Section 3 we describe
the high- and low-resolution photometry algorithms. In

Section 4 we describe the catalog format, ALMA coun-
terparts, and quality ﬂags. Section 4.3 presents the qual-
ity and consistency check for our catalog. In Section 5
we describe the spectral energy distribution ﬁtting of
our photometry, resultant photometric redshifts, stellar
population parameters, and rest-frame colors. Finally
our main conclusions and summary are given in Sec-
tion 6.

Throughout this paper we assume a ﬂat ΛCDM cos-
mology with Ωm,0 = 0.3, ΩΛ,0 = 0.7 and H0 = 70
km s−1 Mpc−1, and a Chabrier (2003) initial mass
function (IMF). All magnitudes in this paper are ex-
pressed in the AB system (Oke 1974), for which a ﬂux
fν in µJy (10−23 erg cm−2 s−1 Hz−1) corresponds to
ABν = 23.9 − 2.5 log10(fν/µJy).

2. DATA SETS

The ALCS is a Cycle 6 ALMA large program (Project
ID: 2018.1.00035.L; PI: K. Kohno) targeting 33 lensing
cluster ﬁelds in Band 6 (¯λ = 1.15 mm/¯ν = 260 GHz).
In total ALCS covers an area of 134 arcmin2, with pri-
mary beam response greater than 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5, reaching a depth
of 70 µJy (1σ). The sample is designed to be contained
within the best-studied massive clusters also imaged in
HST programs. More speciﬁcally, ALCS includes 5 clus-
ters from HFF (Lotz et al. 2017), plus the new BUF-
FALO observations (Steinhardt et al. 2020), 16 clusters
from the RELICS (Coe et al. 2019), and 12 clusters from
CLASH (Postman et al. 2012). The observations aim to
provide an in-depth look of the high magniﬁcation re-
gions within the cluster ﬁelds, and, in particular, target
dust-continuum-selected and line-emitting high-z galax-
ies. The main science goal of the survey is to exam-
ine the faint-end slope of the 1.2 mm source counts, to
provide the best estimate for the cosmic infrared back-
ground (CIB) at that wavelength. The typical galaxies
contributing to the CIB at 1.2 mm are intrinsically faint
(see e.g. Fujimoto et al. 2016), however in conjunction
with the rich HST and Spitzer /IRAC data-sets cover-
ing the ﬁeld, the survey aims to reveal the fundamental
physical properties of the S1.2mm < 0.1 mJy galaxies,
such as stellar masses and IR based SFRs (see Sun et al.
2022).

We list a few major motivations in constructing a uni-
form HST /Spitzer mosaics in ALCS ﬁelds as follows.
A vast majority of objects within ALCS are only con-
tinuum detected, ruling out redshift constraints from
spectra. However, the rich UV-optical and NIR trea-
sury data already collected within these cluster ﬁelds,
will allow for the derivation of photometric redshifts for
a vast majority of faint sub-mm galaxies. This will allow
for the derivation of the dust-based FIR luminosity func-

tions, and give upper limits on its evolution at z > 3,
something that has been out of reach for Spitzer and
Herschel.

The ALCS is also expected to detect the ionized car-
bon (CII) and carbon monoxide (CO) emission lines,
facilitating the studies of the ISM for a unique sample
of faint galaxies magniﬁed by lensing clusters. More-
over, even for non-detections the mm-properties of var-
ious classes of SFGs can be extracted through stacking,
facilitated by the presence of both HST and IRAC pri-
ors within these lensed ﬁelds (e.g. see Guerrero et al.
2022 in prep. and Jolly et al. 2022 in prep.).

An additional emphasis of the survey is to de-
tect and characterize the magniﬁed ALMA continuum
sources, without HST counterparts, i.e.
the intrinsi-
cally faint, “HST - dark”, ALMA sources. The major-
ity of these objects also have faint counterparts in the
Spitzer/IRAC bands, with the measured IRAC to 1.2
mm ﬂux density ratios (Sun et al. 2022) pointing to-
wards these sources being either distant z (cid:38) 4 galaxies,
or massive BCG progenitors at z ∼ 4, similar to the ob-
jects presented in Wang et al. (2016, 2019); Yamaguchi
et al. (2019); Gruppioni et al. (2020); Umehata et al.
(2020).

2.1. CHArGE HST Imaging

The Complete Hubble Archive for Galaxy Evolution
(CHArGE) is a novel initiative that performs uniform
processing of all archival Hubble Space Telescope imag-
ing and slitless spectroscopy observations relevant for
studying distant galaxies (e.g., reasonably high galactic
latitudes, avoiding large foreground galaxies, including
WFC3/IR). The data were processed with the grizli
pipeline (Brammer & Matharu 2021), which creates ﬁl-
ter mosaics for all ACS, WFC3/UVIS and WFC3/IR
exposures that cover a given area of the sky (e.g., an
ALCS ﬁeld). Although, it is worth noting that the pro-
duced catalogs span, for each cluster, an area multiple
times larger than of the ALCS ALMA maps. The over-
lapping exposures are then broken into discrete “visit”
associations, where the grouping is done for a given ﬁlter
for data that were taken in a single target acquisition.
These associations generally share the same spacecraft
orientation and zodiacal sky background.

Within a single visit, all exposures are aligned to each
other using high S/N sources detected in them, allowing
the relative x and y coordinates between exposures to
shift, until the best match is found. These are analogous
to DrizzlePac TweakShifts and are generally a fairly
small fraction of a pixel for dither oﬀsets within a single
orbit and a few tenths of a pixel between subsequent
orbits that share the same initial target acquisition.

A source catalog is created from a preliminary mosaic
generated from the visit exposures and aligned (shift,
rotation, scale) to an astrometric reference catalogue.
Generally this is PanSTARRS DR1 (Flewelling et al.
2020) as it is well aligned to the Gaia DR2 (Gaia Col-
laboration et al. 2016, 2018), but has a higher source
density than the bright Gaia stars alone.

The ﬁnal ﬁne alignment is performed simultaneously
optimising a) the alignment between all individual visit
catalogs, and b) Gaia DR2 stars with proper motions
projected to each visit observation epoch. This en-
sures robust internal alignment of the HST images for
matched-aperture photometry and the ﬁnal absolute as-
trometric precision is generally < 100 mas.

A pedestal sky background of each exposure is esti-
mated in the AstroDrizzle preparation of each visit as-
sociation. A smooth background is subtracted from each
visit mosaic to remove gradients that can then appear as
sharp discontinuities in the ﬁnal combined ﬁlter mosaics.
This background is estimated with the sep (Barbary
2016), a pythonic implementation of SourceExtrac-
tor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) with BACK FILTERSIZE =
3 and BACK SIZE = 32 arcsec. While the background
estimation includes a mask for detected sources, it can
include extended structure for very large, bright galaxies
and inter-cluster light (ICL) in the ALCS cluster ﬁelds.
Final rectiﬁed mosaics combining all exposures in each
available ﬁlter are created with AstroDrizzle. All
WFC3/IR mosaics are created with 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 pixels, while
the ACS and UVIS optical/UV images are drizzled with
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)05 pixels on a grid that subsamples the IR mosaic
2 × 2. Both optical and IR mosaics are drizzled with
pixfrac = 0.33. The sci (science) and wht (inverse
variance weights) mosaics are provided for each ﬁlter.

While this approach might not necessarily result in
the best reconstruction of the undersampled HST PSFs,
but the larger pixels ensure more uniform weights across
the diversity of dither coverage across the survey ﬁelds
(e.g., hundreds of exposures for the Frontier Fields but
as few as 2–4 exposures for some pre-RELICS ﬁlters).
The larger pixels and small pixfrac result in lower cor-
related noise between adjacent pixels, and therefore the
inverse variance maps are more reliable estimate of the
pixel variances for, e.g., aperture photometry.

The units of the ﬁlter mosaics are in electrons/s, with
the photometric calibration to cgs units provided in the
PHOTFLAM (fλ) and PHOTFNU (fν) header keywords of
each mosaic. We additionally provide PSF models for

Figure 1. Footprint of the HST observations, superimposed on the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 µm data of four Frontier Field Clusters
(Lotz et al. 2017). The ALCS band 6 ALMA coverage is shown as the shaded orange areas. The images shown cover both the
cluster and the parallels of the HFF.

We begin by collecting all the Basic Calibrated
Data (BCD) exposures (pBCD), from the Spitzer SHA
archive for each ﬁeld in the ALCS. These only include
Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 µm, as our ﬁelds of interest do
not have a uniform coverage in 5.8 and 8 µm. Similarly
to how we process the HST CHArGE data, we perform
relative alignment of all exposures in the IRAC Astro-
nomical Observation Requests (AOR), and then align
AOR mosaics to GAIA DR2. A larger size of IRAC
FoV is generally beneﬁcial, as it allows for a suﬃcient
number of reference sources to be used for alignment.

The IRAC background is removed by creating a mas-
ter background image for each AOR with detected
sources masked. Finally, the complete IRAC mosaics
are aligned to the HST pixel grid and drizzled with 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5
pixels and the pixel fraction parameter pixfrac set to
0.2.

With full knowledge of the individual pBCD exposures
that contribute at any location in the ﬁnal mosaic, we
can generate robust models of the IRAC PSF that fully

account for the diversity of depth and detector position
angle across the mosaic. These position-dependent PSFs
are used for the IRAC model-based photometry, and can
be re-generated using golfir.

3. PHOTOMETRY

During the generation of this catalogue, we have
treated the highly resolved (HST /ACS and WFC3)
data diﬀerently from the low-resolution Spitzer/IRAC
data.

3.1. HST photometry

We extract aperture photometry within (circular)
aperture diameters 0.36, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 3.0 arc-
sec at the positions derived in the source detection as
described above. We do not perform PSF-matching for
any HST ﬁlters for the aperture measurements. This
PSF-matching approach is quite common in the litera-
ture (e.g. see Shipley et al. 2018), however, performing
it on the images can result in substantial deleterious

utilised to perform the PSF - matched photometry ex-
traction if necessary.

To compute aperture corrections we have deﬁned
the “total” HST ﬂux density within an elliptical Kron
aperture determined by sep, as in SourceExtrac-
tor. However, we do not impose the lower limit of
3.5 on KRON RADIUS typical with SourceExtractor
as we ﬁnd that in fact most derived values are actually
lower than this threshold even for bright, well-measured
sources. We do, however, impose a minimum circular-
ized Kron aperture diameter of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7, which is our favored
“color” aperture. We calculate a correction for ﬂux out-
side of the Kron aperture using the PSF curves of growth
(i.e., explicitly valid only for point sources). The “color”
aperture ﬂuxes are therefore corrected by 1) flux auto
/ flux aper in the detection band and then 2) by the
Kron aperture correction.

3.2. IRAC photometry

Calculating the photometry from low-resolution data,
particularly in crowded regions containing galaxy clus-
ters can be a diﬃcult technical challenge. In order to
correctly extract the ﬂux density in the redder bands,
the signiﬁcant diﬀerences that exist between the HST
data and the much lower resolution Spitzer /IRAC im-
age data must be taken into account. Primarily this
concerns the problem of blending, wherein a standard
aperture photometry approach normally used for high-
resolution data would be inadequate. To tackle this is-
sue in our work, we use the Great Observatories Legacy
Fields IR Analysis Tools or golfir, a set of tools devel-
oped to model Spitzer /IRAC and MIPS images based
on high resolution templates from existing HST imag-
ing, speciﬁcally in the context of the CHArGE data.

The method follows an approach utilized in similar
lensing cluster catalog works (e.g. MOPHONGO; Skel-
ton et al. 2014; Shipley et al. 2018 and T-PHOT; Merlin
et al. 2015, 2016), and relies on using a high-resolution
prior. We create this prior by combining all the avail-
able HST ACS/WFC and WFC3/IR ﬁlters, to produce
a weighted mosaic, based on their corresponding inverse
variance maps. We then use a convolution kernel to com-
bine the detection image with the IRAC PSF and pro-
duce the low-resolution templates. The original IRAC
image is then divided into square patches, of user de-
ﬁned size. These patches are also allowed to overlap,
to allow for correct modelling of sources at the patch
boundaries. For consistency we used a patch size of 1.2
arcmin with the 0.4 arcmin overlap for all the ﬁelds in
our work. These parameters were chosen to achieve a
balance between the quality of the ﬁnal model image,
and the available computational resources.

within ALCS clusters. These ﬁlters include (top to bot-
tom):

two bands from Spitzer /IRAC.

eﬀects on the noise properties of the derived photome-
try at shorter wavelengths. In particular, faint and/or
dropout sources would be most aﬀected, where there is
no signal to use in matching. In this work our scope is to
focus on the faint, marginally detected objects. While
the PSF - matching approach would result in, generally,
more robust colors and photometric redshifts, we favor
the approach here, primarily for simplicity and consis-
tency across a wide variety of ﬁelds, with diﬀerent noise
properties, and defer tests on the aperture eﬀects to on-
going work. Together with the derived photometry we
also provide HST mosaics for all ﬁlters, which can be

Figure 3. Results from the modelling procedure on the relatively crowded Abell 370 cluster ﬁeld. The cutouts are 30” across,
and were selected to show a wide variety of sources on the same image, i.e. the ones modelled purely with golfir, and the
galaxy model reﬁned by using GALFIT. Top: The HST RGB image created from the combination of F814W, F125W and
F160W ﬁlters, the HST detection image and segmentation map. Middle: The original IRAC 3.6 µm science image, the golfir
model and residual images. Bottom: Same as above, but for IRAC 4.5 µm ﬁlters. The color scale has been adjusted to show
the 3σ range for each image. Most notably, the ﬁnal residual mosaic can also be used to extract additional IRAC photometry
for sources without an HST counterpart. The images are oriented with north up, and east to the left.

In order to improve the quality of extracted photome-
try we manually mask the brightest stars in a given ﬁeld,
prior to conducting the least square ﬁt. We use the Gaia
DR2 archive for the positions, and scale the size of the
circular mask depending on the G-band magnitude of
each star. We also mask all the pixels in the IRAC
mosaic, for objects where the HST catalog is brighter
than AB = 15. This is done to avoid large residuals
in the centers of bright stars that have not been manu-
ally masked. We additionally mask all pixels where the
IRAC S/N is above 80.

For the ﬁrst model pass we generate IRAC model
images for all objects in the HST detection catalog,
brighter than AB = 24, by using the aforementioned
convolved HST source cutouts, transformed into (posi-
tion - dependent) IRAC PSFs. A least square ﬁt of the
low resolution IRAC cutouts is then performed to the
real data, where the normalization acts as the only free
parameter. We additionally derive any small residual
shift between the reference HST and target IRAC mo-
saics, by using the generated IRAC model and mosaic
images.

For the second model pass, we now focus on fainter
HST galaxies, with AB < 27. IRAC models are then
generated as before, with the least square normalizations
now being adopted as the IRAC ﬂux density measure-
ment for each source. The diagonal of the covariance
of the model design matrix is adopted as the photo-
metric variance. An additional model reﬁnement with
GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002), is performed on sources
for which the total SN is more than 50. For this we
have used a single S´ersic model (S´ersic 1963). This of-
ten signiﬁcantly improves the IRAC residuals, which is
likely a combination of 1) an imperfect transformation
between the HST and IRAC PSFs and 2) true mor-
phological diﬀerences between F160W and the IRAC
bands, for example the color gradients. We note that
we are not interested in the GALFIT parameters, but
rather in the best empirical description of each IRAC
morphological component. We do not adopt the ”mag”
of the GALFIT ﬁt, but rather reﬁt the model normal-
izations and covariances as in the previous steps, now
using the GALFIT model cutouts in place of the HST -
based models for the sources that have them. We show
an example of the images processed with our pipeline in
Figure 3.

As the IRAC ﬂux densities are based on morphological
model ﬁts, we consider them to be on the same ”total”
scale as the aperture-corrected HST photometry. These
are the IRAC ﬂux densities that we will use for all our
future data analysis. In addition to the model ﬂux den-
sity ﬁts, we also perform a simple aperture photometry
measurement on our images, by using a D = 3.”0 aper-
tures, similar to the approach taken in Shipley et al.
(2018). Using the IRAC PSF curves of growth we then
correct the aperture ﬂux densities into total ﬂux density.
The model, aperture and aperture corrected ﬂux density
measurements are all available in the ﬁnal version of the
catalog. In Table 1 we list all the names, coordinates
and coverage areas of all 33 cluster ﬁelds covered by
ALCS. We would also like to note that for the Hubble
Frontier Fields, we do not make a distinction between
the parallels or the cluster, and rather treat the entire
mosaic, and objects within it, to be contained within a
single ﬁeld.

4. CATALOG

4.1. ALMA Photometry

To further complement our photometric catalog, we
have included an additional data entry containing either
the measurement or the upper limit on the ALMA ﬂux
density. To do this, we start by cross-matching our ob-
jects with the ALMA continuum catalog (Fujimoto et al.
2022; in prep). This catalog contains 180 sources, which

have been selected with a S/N cut > 4. The total ﬂux
densities are computed as a peak count, after primary
beam correction in the tapered map [mJy/beam]. If no
peak is identiﬁed in the tapered map within a radius of
1.0 arcsec, the pixel count at the position of the source is
used instead. We do not match these sources automati-
cally, as this approach is inadequate for nearby or highly
magniﬁed sources with complex image plane morphol-
ogy.
In addition to the the astrometry diﬀerence, the
ALMA beam size might result in erroneous counterpart
assignment. Instead we manually examine cutouts for
all 180 objects, and assign the HST /Spitzer counter-
part by-hand, if such is available, to the ALMA detected
object. In total, we ﬁnd 145/180 matches during this
procedure. These are ﬂagged with alma coverage = 2
in the catalog. From the 35 objects that do not have
a match to our catalog: 14 are “HST -dark” with clear
detections in both IRAC channels; 8 are not visible in ei-
ther HST or IRAC; 10 fall outside of the HST area, but
have clear IRAC detections; 3 are too close to a star, or
some other image artifact. The HST and IRAC ”dark”
objects are cataloged separately, and will be discussed
in a later section.

Apart from the aforementioned 145, the remaining
objects in our catalog do not have reliably measured
ALMA counterparts, however the ALMA continuum
map at 1.2 mm still overlaps signiﬁcantly with our mo-
saics, and as such it is still possible to extract the
ALMA upper limits at the positions of our sources.
We begin the extraction of upper limits by isolating
a sub-sample of sources in our catalogue that do not
have an ALMA counterpart in the continuum catalogue,
but still fall within an ALMA map. The objects that
fall outside of ALMA coverage have been ﬂagged with
alma coverage = 0. Within each ﬁeld, we have used an
approach similar to the original ﬂux density extraction
of Fujimoto et al. (2022; in prep) and measured the ﬂux
density from the central pixel on the ALMA map. As
the uncertainty on the measured ﬂux density we adopted
the noise level of the entire map (as described in Fuji-
moto et al. 2022, in prep), calibrated to the area of the
In total, this results in 30,586/217,958 ALMA
beam.
upper limit measurements. While these are only upper
limits, the addition of an extra constraint in the FIR
will signiﬁcantly enhance the quality of panchromatic
SED ﬁtting. For example, these measurements can help
to compute the upper limits on the dust mass (Mdust),
for objects up to z ∼ 7, and the infrared luminosity LIR
above z ∼ 9. This is due to the fact that the 1.2 mm
stops sampling the rest-frame continuum above 150 µm
at z ∼ 7, which is required for robust calculations of
the dust mass (e.g. see discussion in Berta et al. 2016

and Kokorev et al. 2021). In return, however, the 80-
120 µm regime will then become available for 1.2 mm
photometry at z = 9, which would allow to sample the
peak of the FIR emission and allow to impose tighter
constraints on both total infrared luminosity LIR and
the dust temperature - Tdust. This naturally depends
on how dusty, high-z galaxies actually are, and whether
the commonly used optically thin dust approximation
will apply to them.

4.2. Catalog Description and Flags

We provide separate multi-wavelength photometric
catalogs for each of the 33 clusters covered by ALCS.
Combined, the catalogs contain aperture and total ﬂux
density measurements for 218,000 sources. We list the
description of the relevant columns of the catalog in Ta-
ble 2. All ﬂux densities and associated uncertainties
are in units of µJy, unless speciﬁed otherwise. For the
HST data we include the aperture photometry, mea-
sured within D =0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7, and the associated total ﬂux den-
sities. The IRAC measurements are provided as the
golfir modeled IRAC photometry, as well as aperture
(and aperture corrected) ﬂux densities, measured within
D =3.(cid:48)(cid:48)0. The cross-matched ALMA photometry is pro-
vided in units of µJy/beam. We also include an ALMA
source ﬂag column - alma coverage, where 2 - indicates
a detection, 1 - an upper limit and 0 - a lack of cover-
age. To help discern between the high and low quality
photometry for sources in the catalog, we have added a
number of ﬂags which allow to uniformly select reliable
samples of objects. For each source we compute how
many pixels in a 3x3 square around the center have been
masked or fall outside the IRAC mosaic. This number is
given in the n masked column. If the central pixel itself
is masked or missing, we ﬂag that source with bad phot
= 1.

4.3. Comparison to the existing catalogs

Provided that there are existing catalogs in the lensed
ﬁelds included in ALCS, it is also useful to perform a
comparison of our catalog and those presented in the
literature. These include the publicly available photo-
metric catalogs in the Hubble Frontier (HFF-DeepSpace
Shipley et al. (2018); ASTRODEEP Merlin et al. (2016);
Di Criscienzo et al. (2017)) and CLASH ﬁelds (Molino
et al. 2017). Series of diagnostic plots, including broad-
band photometry, color-color diagrams and number
counts are fully presented and discussed in the Ap-
pendix A.

have used the updated Python version of EAZY (Bram-
mer et al. 2008). EAZY is a photometric spectral en-
ergy distribution ﬁtting code which is optimised to ﬁt
non-negative linear combinations of basis-set templates,
rather than devising a solution from vast libraries of pre-
compiled models. These templates are extracted from
the Flexible Stellar Populations Synthesis (FSPS; Con-
roy et al. 2009) models, and then reduced to a set of 12,
which are able to reproduce a much larger library, span-
ning a variety of dust attenuation, ages, mass-to-light
ratios and star-formation history (SFH) properties (see
Brammer et al. 2008 and Blanton & Roweis 2007). We
have listed the properties for these individual templates
in Table 4. For each object in our multi-wavelength cat-
alogue, EAZY integrates redshifted templates through
a set of ﬁlters corresponding to our observed bands, and
then ﬁnds the best combination for a given set of ﬂux
densities and associated uncertainties.

To improve the quality of the photometric redshift es-
timate, EAZY also implements a “template error func-
tion”, which is used to account any other miscellaneous
uncertainties related to short-lived and otherwise un-
usual stellar populations, and the emission lines coupled
to the properties of the ISM. In our analysis we have
used a default template error function value of 0.2. To
calculate the photometric redshifts and physical param-
eters with EAZY we have used total HST ﬂux densities,
calculated from the D =0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7 aperture measurement, and
the golfir IRAC models. These data are contained

the spectroscopic redshifts with the most recent results
from Richard et al. 2021.
In total we recover 5,055
matches with our catalogue, in all ﬁve HFF ﬁelds, in-
cluding the parallels. Please note however, that the
number of spectroscopic redshifts in the parallel ﬁelds
is severely limited. We include them in our ﬁnal com-
parison for posterity.

For CLASH we have compiled the most recent data
from GLASS (Treu et al. 2015; Schmidt et al. 2014),
the results from Caminha et al. 2019 and Richard et al.
2021.
In total there are 2,090 matches with our cat-
alogue, spanning ten out of twelve CLASH ﬁelds. Fi-
nally, for the RELICS spectroscopic redshifts, we have
used the data from Richard et al. (2021) for RXC0600,
and a compilation of spec-z data presented in Guerrero
et al.
In total we ﬁnd 351 matches
with our catalogs. The full list of ﬁelds and matches is
outlined in Table 3.

(2022, in prep).

5.2. Photometric Redshift Accuracy

To quantify the precision of our photo-z estimate we
used the normalised median absolute deviation (NMAD,
Hoaglin et al. 1983), deﬁned as:

σNMAD = 1.48 × median

(cid:18) |∆z − median(∆z)|
1 + zspec

(cid:19)

.

(1)

This method in commonly used in the literature (e.g.
see Shipley et al. 2018; Skelton et al. 2014), allowing
for a quick and unbiased comparison of redshift quality
between diﬀerent catalogs, and is also less sensitive to
outliers as described in Brammer et al. 2008. The outlier
fraction η is given by |∆z|/(1+zspec) > 0.15, following
the methodology described in Hildebrandt et al. 2012.
In total we have carried out the comparison for 7,107
matched objects, excluding catastrophic outliers, span-
ning 24 ﬁelds, shown in Figure 5. We ﬁnd that our
redshift accuracy is generally good, with a σNMAD of
0.0406, and 20.6 % of catastrophic failures.

For both the zphot − zphot and zphot − zspec compar-
isons, we note the existence of over-densities located ei-
ther at z ∼ 1 or z ∼ 4, for which ∆z ∼ 3. This is
where a vast majority of our catastrophic outliers are
located. These redshift discrepancies are caused by the
mis-identiﬁcation between the Lyman (912 ˚A) and the
Balmer (3644 ˚A) breaks, as well as the 4000 ˚A break,
in the ﬁtted SEDs. The manifestation of the break con-
fusion is a consequence of degenerate behaviour of tem-

in ”{filt} ﬂux” and ”irac {ch} ﬂux” columns, respec-
tively.

From the best ﬁt EAZY SEDs we derive the stellar
population properties which include, but are not limited
to the SFR, AV , M∗ and rest-frame colors. We present
the distribution of the de-magniﬁed M∗ with redshift
in Figure 4. In addition to that, we also highlight the
ALMA detected ALCS sources, including the (Fujimoto
et al. 2021) object at z = 6.07. We note that ALMA
detected objects are more massive when compared to the
other galaxies in the catalog. A similar trend has been
observed in both in M1500 vs z, and M ∗ vs z relations
in Dunlop et al. (2017).

5.1. Spectroscopic Redshift Catalogs

The ALCS ﬁelds have been covered by an wide range
of spectroscopic surveys. We have examined the litera-
ture and compiled all of the available spectroscopic red-
shifts in order to assess the quality of our photometric
redshifts. During this process we select only the sources
with robust redshift constraints, and choose the most
recent source, if a galaxy is present in multiple cata-
logs. We have cross-matched all the available spectro-
scopic redshifts with objects in our catalogue, using a
1.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 matching radius. These spectroscopic redshifts are
included in our main catalogue, with a separate column
providing the source where available.

For Hubble Frontier Fields we have used spectro-
scopic redshifts already compiled in Shipley et al. 2018,
this includes Grism Lens-Ampliﬁed Survey from Space
(GLASS) (Treu et al. 2015; Schmidt et al. 2014), and
the spectral data presented in Smith et al. 2009; Ow-

where β is the lensing depth, deﬁned as β = Dls/Ds,
with Dls being the angular diameter distance between
the lens and the source, and Ds is the angular diameter
distance to the source. Similarly to Rawle et al. 2016, if
the source redshift zs is below or within the cluster red-
shift zcl, namely zs ≤ zcl + 0.1, we set the magniﬁcation
to unity. Sources that fall outside of the magniﬁcation
maps for a given ﬁeld, are not expected to be signiﬁ-
cantly aﬀected by gravitational lensing. For these, we
have set µ = 1. Please note that we do not apply these
lensing corrections to any ﬂux densities listed in our cat-
alog.

5.4. Red Sequence

In lieu of secure spectroscopic redshifts, a deﬁnitive as-
sessment of cluster membership for galaxies in our cat-
alog can not be achieved. While the zphot probability
density functions (p(z)) and the comparison to zspec via
σNMAD can provide us with important hints regarding
the robustness of photometric redshifts, an additional
quality test is required.

We can exploit the observational

fact which dic-
tates that the majority of early-type galaxies (ETGs),
that consist in massive clusters, display a tight color-
magnitude correlation. This relation has been referred
to as the Cluster Red Sequence, or just the red sequence
(Gladders & Yee 2000). This color - magnitude relation
was shown to hold from cluster to cluster (L´opez-Cruz
et al. 2004) and also displays a relatively small scatter
(Bower et al. 1992). The technique provides an inde-
pendent redshift constraint for galaxies contained within
clusters, with the ETG overdensities being exploited as
a cluster marker for quite some time in the literature
(L´opez-Cruz 1997; Gladders et al. 1998; Kaiser et al.
1998; Yee et al. 1999; Lubin et al. 2000; L´opez-Cruz
et al. 2004).

Eﬀectively the cluster galaxies which should lie on the
red sequence can be isolated from the ﬁeld objects with
only two ﬁlters that cover the 4000 ˚A break. For our
dataset this can be achieved through a combination of
the F435W and F606W HST /ACS ﬁlters. In Figure 7
we present a red sequence diagnostic plot for the HFF
galaxies that are considered to be within clusters based
on their photometric redshift (|zphot−zcluster| ≤ 0.1) and
are also bright (mF606W < 25). By examining the distri-
bution of galaxies as a function of redshift we note the
presence of distinct density peaks located in proximity
to the cluster redshift. The color - magnitude diagnostic
plot also reveals that galaxies which we have selected to
be a part of the cluster based on the zphot tend to form
a distinct color sequence on the diagnostic plot. From
the combination of both σNMAD and red sequence di-

plates, when faced with either sparse or very faint pho-
tometry, and is particularly prominent when we compare
large samples of photometric redshifts between diﬀerent
catalogs

5.3. Gravitational Lensing Magniﬁcation

For objects within the cluster ﬁelds we compute and
provide the lensing magniﬁcation factor (µ), which is
based on the RA,DEC coordinate of the source in the
detection band (i.e. the peak ﬂux density coordinate)
and its redshift. Although a vast majority of sources in
a given ﬁeld only have a zphot estimate, we use a zspec
where possible. Following the methodology described
in Sun et al. (2022), we use the Zitrin-NFW lens mod-
els (Zitrin et al. 2013, 2015) for the HFF and CLASH
clusters, and GLAFIC models (Oguri 2010; Okabe et al.
2020) for RELICS. These models consist of the mass sur-
face density (κ) and weak lensing shear (γ) maps. We
then compute the magniﬁcation by using:

µ =

1
(1 − κ β)2 − (γ β)2 ,

agnostics, we conclude that the recovered photometric
redshifts, and the stellar population parameters derived
based on them, are robust both for the ﬁeld and cluster
galaxies in our catalogs.

5.5. Rest-Frame Color Galaxy Classiﬁcation

Comparison of galaxies at diﬀerent redshifts often re-
quires rest-frame, rather than observed frame, colors to
be used. For each galaxy these are determined by as-
suming the best-ﬁt EAZY template and its redshift, in
order to calculate the rest-frame ﬂux density for a set of
ﬁlters. The rest-frame colors are then computed by in-
tegrating a transmission curve for a given ﬁlter through
the best ﬁt template, as described in Brammer et al.
2011. In our ﬁnal catalogs we provide the rest-frame ﬂux
densities for the most commonly used ﬁlters (GALEX
N U V , COSMOS r, Johnson U , B, V , and J).

The rest-frame ﬂux densities can be used to assess
the galaxy populations in each ﬁeld by using the color-
color analysis. Multiple previous studies have devised
a variety of techniques to classify galaxies based on the
broad-band photometry. One such prescription utilises
the U − V and V − J rest-frame colors (Labb´e et al.
2005; Wuyts et al. 2007; Williams et al. 2009) to sep-
arate galaxies into quiescent, star-forming. Quiescent
galaxies with low levels of star formation are red in
the U − V regime and are easily distinguished from the
similarly red (in U − V ), dusty, star-forming galaxies,
with the V − J color. An alternative method, using the
N U V − r − J colors instead, has been proposed by Il-
bert et al. (2013) and Arnouts et al. (2013). While the
U V J selection is the most commonly used approach in
the literature, the N U V rJ method has some key ad-
vantages. The shorter wavelength N U V band is more
sensitive both to the dust attenuation and emission from

young stellar populations than the U band. Although
the amount of quiescent galaxies at z > 2 is limited (see
e.g. Ilbert et al. 2013; Muzzin et al. 2013; Davidzon et al.
2017), the rest-frame U band would already be shifted
into near-IR bands, this would make the N U V rJ se-
lection technique more reliable at higher redshifts.
In
our paper we adopt the N U V rJ selection, however the
U and V rest frame ﬂux densities are also provided in
our ﬁnal catalog. We display our selection in Figure 8,
where the quiescent galaxies tend to be located in the
upper-left corner of the diagram, with the boundaries
deﬁned in Ilbert et al. (2013):

N U V − r =




3 (r − J) + 1



3.1

for

for

r − J > 0.7

r − J < 0.7.

When comparing the U V J and N U V rJ color classiﬁ-
cation methods, ∼ 70% of objects selected with N U V rJ
overlap with U V J quiescent candidates, varying slightly
with the depth of our ﬁeld of choice, and therefore its
redshift distribution. Overall we ﬁnd that 17 % of ob-
jects in HFF, 23 % in RLC and 17 % in CLS are located
in the upper quadrant of the N U V rJ diagram, and can
thus be classiﬁed as quiescent. The ALCS covers cluster
ﬁelds, where the star formation is generally expected to
be suppressed, especially at low redshift (see e.g. Boselli
et al. 2016 and references therein). Therefore it is not at
all surprising for us to recover high fractions of quiescent
galaxies.

survey. The mosaics and catalogs cover a combined area
of ∼ 690 arcmin2, in 33 ALCS ﬁelds, which include 5
Hubble Frontier, 16 RELICS, and 12 CLASH ﬁelds. The
ﬁnal catalog numbers roughly 218,000 sources, which
are covered by at most 12 HST /ACS,UVIS and WFC3
bands, plus the additional IRAC photometry at 3.6 and
4.5 µm. To process these data we have reprocessed
and recombined all the available archival HST expo-
sures, now combined into a single CHArGE dataset, as
well as all available IRAC data covering the same ﬁelds.
Each image has been aligned to the same highly precise
Gaia DR2 reference frame, ensuring a robust internal
alignment of the HST and IRAC images for matched-
aperture photometry, with the ﬁnal absolute astrometric
precision generally being < 100 mas.

In our analysis, we have applied a consistent method-
ology in order to compute multi-wavelength photometry
across all 33 ﬁelds. The sep software (Barbary 2016) is
used to detect sources on a weighted master detection
image from all available ACS/WFC and WFC3/IR ﬁl-
ters of a given ﬁeld. We do not PSF match the HST im-
ages; instead, we extract the photometry for each ﬁlter
separately, with apertures of varying sizes, and then cor-
rect it to total ﬂux densities by using curves of growth.
We use a novel golfir algorithm, which relies on us-
ing the IRAC PSF - convolved high-resolution mosaics
as a prior, to model and extract the IRAC photome-
try. Furthermore, we test the robustness of our derived
photometry by comparing it to the publicly available
HFF-DeepSpace (Shipley et al. 2018) and ASTRODEEP
(Merlin et al. 2016; Di Criscienzo et al. 2017) catalogs
in the Frontier Fields, and the photometric CLASH cat-
alog of Molino et al. (2017). In all cases we ﬁnd results
which are consistent, despite using a diﬀerent approach.
Moreover, compared to the aforementioned catalogs, the
CHArGE data covers a ∼ ×2 area, and thus presents a
substantial improvement in terms of the number of ob-
jects available.

To derive photometric redshifts and stellar popula-
tion parameters, we use an SED ﬁtting software EAZY
(Brammer et al. 2008). For the ﬁelds where uniform
spectroscopic data is available (24/33), we achieve an
average NMAD of 0.0406, for the photometric and spec-
troscopic redshifts across all ﬁelds, with an outlier frac-
tion of 21 %. To accompany our photometric redshifts,
we provide stellar masses, star formation rates, extinc-
tions, and other stellar population parameters based on
the observed photometry. We also compute and use
the rest-frame NUVrJ colors to separate our galaxies
into potentially star-forming and quiescent samples. We
ﬁnd that our lensed cluster sample data contains an in-
creased fraction of QGs, compared to that of blind ﬁeld

observations. In addition to that, we use all the avail-
able magniﬁcation maps in the ALCS ﬁelds, and provide
with our catalog magniﬁcation factors, where possible.
We manually cross-match our data with the 145 SN> 4
ALMA detected galaxies, and provide upper limit mea-
surement for a further ∼ 30,000 sources.

These mosaics and catalogs, produced by the ALCS
team, conclude one of the initial phases of the entire
project, which, as outlined in Section 2, will focus on
multiple aspects and properties of faint sub-mm sources.
These catalogues will also facilitate the detection, and
further examination of the optically dark galaxy popula-
tions (e.g. Wang et al. 2019; Sun et al. 2021; Shu et al.
2022). As such these photometric catalogs can act as
an important tool in designing future observations (e.g.
with Keck/MOSFIRE, JWST, GMT) in an attempt to
elucidate the key questions about the early onset of star
formation, reionization and assembly of ﬁrst galaxies.

Both the HST /Spitzer mosaics, and photometric cat-
alogs described in this work are publicly available in
FITS format, through our repository 2. Alongside the
photometric catalogs for each ALCS ﬁeld, we include
mosaics for all ﬁlters, detection images, segmentation
maps, bright star masks, IRAC models and residuals.
We also provide photometric redshifts and stellar popu-
lation properties, as measured by EAZY, for each ﬁeld.
In the repository we also provide all the technical docu-
mentation regarding the source detection and modeling
parameters, as well as notebooks to re-produce best ﬁt
EAZY SEDs.

APPENDIX

A. QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY

VERIFICATION

In this section we present the comparison between
HST broad-band photometry measurements, and low-
resolution IRAC model photometry to the publicly avail-
able catalogs covering the ALCS ﬁelds. These include
the HFF-DeepSpace and ASTRODEEP catalogs in the
Hubble Frontier Fields (Merlin et al. 2016; Di Criscienzo
et al. 2017; Shipley et al. 2018), which most closely
match our photometric baseline and also process the
IRAC photometry.
In addition we also carry out the
comparison between our photometry and the Molino
et al. 2017 catalogs, in the CLASH ﬁelds, albeit only
for HST data. The comparison is carried out on a per-
ﬁlter basis, and also includes the diﬀerence between the
derived colors. Where appropriate, we also contrast the
area weighted number counts in the appropriate detec-
tion bands.

A.1. HFF-DeepSpace

The HFF-DeepSpace multi-wavelength photometric
catalog is presented in Shipley et al. (2018). The cat-
alog focuses on the six Frontier ﬁelds, plus the asso-
ciated parallels. Our overlap with HFF-DeepSpace in-
cludes all cluster and parallel regions apart from MACS
J0717.5+3745, which we will exclude from our com-
parison. The UV-optical photometric catalog consists
of up to 17 ﬁlters with HST /ACS and HST /WFC3,
VLT/HAWK-I Ks ﬁlter, and the (post-cryogenic) IRAC
3.6 µm and 4.5 µm data, plus the archival IRAC 5.8 µm
and 8 µm measurements, where available.

The HFF-DeepSpace methodology starts with recom-
bination of all the background subtracted HST expo-
sures from diﬀerent epochs, and performing an initial
image cleaning from artifacts and cosmic rays. After
that, for each cluster ﬁeld, they follow the Ferrarese et al.
(2006) method to model and subtract out BCGs and the
ICL from each ﬁeld, performing additional background
cleaning on the BCG - subtracted mosaics. This pro-
cedure allows to identify more objects magniﬁed by the
gravitational potential of the cluster members, and to
assign the correct ﬂux values to galaxies that are located
close to the cluster on the sky.

After the BCGs have been subtracted, all shorter
wavelength mosaics are then PSF matched to the
F160W band. The mosaics for all available HST ﬁl-
ters are then combined into a single weighted mean de-
tection image. The source detection itself, is then per-
formed on the resultant image by using SExtractor,

generally following the methodology described in Skel-
ton et al. (2014). The HST aperture photometry ex-
traction within a diameter of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7 is then performed on
the detection and individual PSF matched HST images,
and the correction to the total ﬂux density is calculated
from the curves of growth.

Low resolution IRAC photometry is extracted by us-
ing MOPHONGO (Labb´e et al. 2013, 2015), a code de-
veloped to process longer wavelength bands, speciﬁcally
focusing on potentially blended objects. Similarly to
golfir the high resolution detection image is convolved
with low-resolution kernel, and used as a model to ﬁt the
IRAC photometry. However, these models are not used
to extract the ﬂux density, but rather to correct for the
possible contamination from the neighbouring sources,
with the IRAC ﬂux densities themselves being extracted
from 3.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 apertures. Additional ﬂux density corrections
are performed by using the PSF curves of growth.

Apart from the aperture corrections, the measured
ﬂux densities of Shipley et al. (2018) have undergone
a number of additional modiﬁcations with the aim of
providing the best possible results during SED ﬁtting.
These include the zeropoint and the Milky Way extinc-
tion corrections. The values presented in our photo-
metric catalog do not incorporate such corrections, and
therefore we had to de-apply them, as speciﬁed in the
Shipley et al. catalog documentation. Our knowledge
of galaxy SEDs is still limited, especially as we move
into the high-z Universe, thus preventing us from ac-
curately calculating the zeropoint corrections (e.g. see
Brown et al. 2014), with the template error function
largely alleviating these eﬀects, however not in their
entirety (Brammer et al. 2008). Moreover, calculating
extinction corrections would largely depend on the the
adopted models, introducing unwanted shifts if not done
carefully. Due to this, although both the zeropoint and
MW corrections are largely inconsequential (O ∼ 2%),
we take great care to convert total ﬂux densities back
to their original values to carry out a robust and unbi-
ased photometry comparison without these corrections.
The ﬂux densities presented in the Shipley et al. cata-
log have been additionally normalized to AB=25, rather
than AB=23.9, which we also take into account when
comparing the results.

number of objects recovered in our work, which after re-
moving potential spurious and masked sources totals to
125,947 across all ﬁve Frontier Fields, ×2.3 larger than
the use phot HFF-DeepSpace sample which numbers
55,579 objects. To perform the photometric compar-
ison between the two catalogs, we only focus on the
regions where the two overlap. However, even for the
parts where our data cover the same area, the CHArGE

images include new exposures, mainly from the BUF-
FALO survey (Steinhardt et al. 2020), not originally
present in the Shipley et al. analysis, particularly on
the edges of the old mosaic. Therefore, blind matching
of all available sources would be inappropriate for a fair
photometry comparison, with the variation in depth po-
tentially introducing some deleterious eﬀects. Instead,
we focus on the central parts of both the cluster (clu)

ALCS: CHArGE HST and Spitzer photometry

23

and parallel (par) regions of all ﬁve Frontier Fields,
where the coverage is deepest and uniform for both
catalogs. In addition, as mentioned in Section 3, we do
not model or subtract the BCG when computing the
photometry, therefore focusing only on the central area
will allow us to contrast how BCG modelling aﬀects
the ﬁnal measured ﬂux densities. We have used a 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0
matching radius, and ﬁnd that the average astromet-
ric oﬀset between the two catalogs in equal to ∼ 0.12
arcsec, which we have corrected for.

In Figure 9 we show a comparison between ALCS
CHArGe/golfir and HFF-DeepSpace catalogs for the
Abell 370 ﬁeld. We carry out the comparison for indi-
vidual ﬁlters, and colors separately for the cluster and
parallel parts, depending on the availability of the pho-
tometry. For HST photometry the agreement is largely
good to excellent. The median oﬀsets vary with in-
strument, from -0.06 mag in HST /ACS, to 0.02 mag in
HST /WFC3 ﬁlters. Our ﬂux densities are consistently
brighter, however this does not seem to stem from the
lack of BCG subtraction, but rather PSF matching per-
formed on all bands apart from F160W, where our me-
dian diﬀerence is zero. This notion is further reinforced
by the fact that the disparity between ﬂux densities is
larger for ACS ﬁlters, where the eﬀects of PSF match-
ing would be most noticeable. For the longer wavelength
IRAC bands, we however note a much larger oﬀset, of
-0.17 mag, both for the cluster and the parallels.
In
an attempt to understand the discrepancy, we have ﬁrst
compared the science images themselves, by randomly
placing 1,000 apertures in the mosaics. The extracted
ﬂux densities were diﬀerent by at most ∼ 0.05 mag,
which does not explain the diﬀerence that we see in our
comparison. We suspect that the discrepancy in the
IRAC bands can be attributed to the diﬀerence in cho-
sen methodology, speciﬁcally the aperture to total ﬂux
correction.

Comparison of colors yields even better results for
both HST and IRAC bands as it largely ignores any dif-
ferences caused by PSF matching the individual bands,
and on the aperture to total ﬂux corrections. We show
these results in Figure 10, again both for cluster and par-
allel parts of Abell 370. Apart from the F160W − 3.6
µm color, we ﬁnd oﬀsets of the order of -0.01 mag. De-
spite the diﬀerence in ﬂux measurements, the agreement
between colors indicates that measurements in both cat-
alogs have been executed in a consistent way.

Finally, in the top panel of Figure 11, we show the area
weighted number of objects, as a function of their ap-
parent magnitude. The source number counts is one of
the basic tests to evaluate and characterise sensitivity-
limited samples. The comparison is performed in the

same ”deep” areas of the Abell 370 ﬁeld, for two repre-
sentative ACS and WFC3 ﬁlters. We do not carry out
the same analysis for the IRAC bands, as the ﬂux oﬀ-
sets are too large to compare the number counts in a
consistent manner. For this comparison we have only
used the ”clean” photometry, i.e. use phot=1 ﬂag for
HFF-DeepSpace and n masked=0 for our data. For each
Frontier Field, our detection algorithm recovers roughly
30 % more sources, speciﬁcally in the faint end. A small
fraction of these are expected to be spurious, or are a
result of overly aggressive deblending of nearby galaxies.
The number counts between both catalogs are however
largely consistent, and show similar depths.

A.2. ASTRODEEP

For the next comparison we focus on the AS-
TRODEEP catalog presented in Merlin et al. (2016),
including the additional data release by Di Criscienzo
et al. (2017). The catalogs present the data for the clus-
ter and parallel pointings for four Frontier Fields, Abell-
2744, MACSJ0416, MACSJ0717 and MACSJ1149, three
of which lie in the ALCS area. The photometric cover-
age includes 10 bands, covering HST /ACS and WFC3,
as well as HAWK-I Ks, and IRAC 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm
data.

The methodology for the ASTRODEEP catalog is
largely similar to the one presented in Shipley et al.
(2018). The ICL and BCGs are modelled and sub-
tracted from the H-band image by using models from
Ferrarese et al. (2006), in conjunction with GALFIT.
The HST source detection is performed on a single im-
age - the WFC3 F160W band by using SExtractor in
both HOT+COLD modes (e.g. see Galametz et al. 2013).
The authors then use a sequential approach to subtract
the ICL and BCGs from all the other cluster images, by
using the output of the previous GALFIT run on a red-
der band, as an initial guess for the bluer one. All of the
images are then PSF - matched to the F160W ﬁlter, by
using a convolution kernel. The ﬁnal HST photometry is
extracted with SExtractor running in dual mode, to
measure the aperture and isophotal ﬂuxes. Total ﬂuxes
in the F160W ﬁlter are computed from the SExtrac-
tor FLUX AUTO parameter. For other bands the total
ﬂux is derived from the scaling of the detection band to
all the relevant isophotal colors.

The low resolution IRAC photometric measurements
in the ASTRODEEP catalog follow a method similar to
the one outlined in this work, and Shipley et al. (2018).
The authors use T-PHOT (Merlin et al. 2015), which
follows the same methodology as both MOPHONGO
and golfir, by using high-resolution images, convolved

with a low resolution PSFs to act as models for the
photometric data.

As before, we only compare sources in the central
parts of both cluster and parallel ﬁelds. For that we used
a matching radius of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0. The average astrometric oﬀ-
set between our sources and the ASTRODEEP catalog
is ∼0.(cid:48)(cid:48)22. In Figure 12 we show a comparison between
ALCS CHArGe/golfir and ASTRODEEP catalogs for
the MACS0416 ﬁeld. For HST photometry the diﬀer-
ence is quite substantial, with a median oﬀset equal to
-0.21 mag for the cluster and -0.11 mag for the parallel
ﬁeld, without dependence on the instrument. We sus-
pect that the BCG subtraction is responsible for half of

the oﬀset, as the diﬀerences in ﬂux are lessened in the
parallel ﬁeld. The ﬂuxes presented in the ASTRODEEP
catalog are also extinction corrected, however we believe
that this is not a major contributor to the diﬀerence that
we ﬁnd. If we ignore the potential eﬀects of BCG sub-
traction, in most cases the diﬀerence between the two
catalogs is not a systematic shift, but rather an oﬀset
increasing at fainter magnitudes. The cause for the ﬂux-
dependent behavior of the oﬀset likely originates from a
diﬀerent aperture used to extract the photometry, and
the methodology to convert that ﬂux to total. Unfortu-
nately we could not carry out the exact ﬂux comparison
to the ASTRODEEP catalog, due to the unavailabil-

as this most closely resembles the approach that we un-
dertook in this work.

We match all 12 CLASH ﬁelds where CHArGE and
catalog data overlap, with a 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0
the Molino et al.
matching radius. The average astrometric oﬀset com-
puted across 12 ﬁelds is equal to ∼ 0.18 arcsec. We
show the comparison between the broad-band photom-
etry for 14 HST ﬁlters in Figure 14. We ﬁnd that the
agreement between the two data-sets is mostly good,
apart from the bluest HST /ACS and UVIS bands. The
median oﬀsets are generally consistent across all instru-
ments and vary from -0.04 mag to 0.07 mag. For all of
the HST /WFC3 and half the HST /ACS our photome-
try seems to be systematically brighter, which changes
towards being fainter when we move towards bluer ﬁl-
ters. The oﬀsets become substantially pronounced for
the bluest ACS and WFC3/UVIS bands, with medians
reaching upwards of 0.47, indicating that our ﬂux den-
sity measurements for those bands are ∼ 1.5× fainter.
Similarly to our comparison with the Shipley et al. data,
the fact that this discrepancy only manifests itself in a
speciﬁc subset of bands indicates that its origins are not
coming from the BCG or ICL subtraction. We thus con-
clude, as before, that the magnitude oﬀsets are coming
from the PSF matching procedure. The moderate aper-
ture sizes described in Molino et al. are optimised to in-
tegrate almost all of the light around the galaxy, where
the maximum aperture size is dictated by a S/N thresh-
old. While some considerations regarding contamination
from the neighbouring have been made, the convolution
of the high-resolution blue ACS and UVIS bands could
have had a deleterious eﬀect on the extracted photome-
try. The color comparison, presented in Figure 15 yields
consistent results, across the majority of HST bands,
and only strongly deviates for the aforementioned bands
where the magnitude oﬀsets are also large.

In the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5
and total ﬂux corrections.
µm ﬁlters, however, we ﬁnd a remarkable agreement, of
∼ −0.01 mag, in both cluster and parallel ﬁelds. The
color comparison, again, yields consistent results, across
all HST and IRAC ﬁlters. We ﬁnd an average oﬀset of
-0.01 mag for all colors, apart from the F160W − 3.6
µm color.

Despite large oﬀsets in the ACS and WFC3 bands, we
show a number count comparison to the ASTRODEEP
catalog in the bottom panel of Figure 11, as the mag-
nitude oﬀset are too large to yield reasonable results.
Notably, however, we again recover roughly 30 % more
sources, in both cluster and parallel ﬁelds on the faint
end.

A.3. CLASH HST Catalog

For our ﬁnal broad-band photometry comparison we
focus on the CLASH HST catalog presented in Molino
et al. (2017). The catalog contains photometry for 25
massive galaxy clusters in CLASH, and overlaps with
all 12 ALCS CLASH clusters that we analyzed in our
work. The photometric coverage includes 14 bands from
HST only, covering HST /ACS and WFC3/UVIS and
WFC3/IR.

Similarly to the HFF - DeepSpace and ASTRODEEP
catalogs, the ICL and BCG contribution are subtracted
from the image. This is achieved by ﬁrst running SEx-
tractor on the deep NIR detection images, and then
based on the detected source catalog, modelling and sub-
traction are performed. After this all short wavelength
mosaics are then PSF - homogenized to the WFC3/IR
camera. The photometry itself is performed by using
two diﬀerent sets of apertures which the authors deﬁne
as the restricted and the moderate.
In the case of
the restricted aperture SExtractor is forced to de-
ﬁne the AUTO magnitude to the smallest available radius,
which does not necessarily integrate all of the light from
the galaxy, but results in the higher overall S/N. The
authors argue that this approach is less sensitivity to
PSF variations across images and results in more robust
recovery of colors, thus yielding more accurate photo-z
estimates. The latter case of the moderate aperture is
more similar to our approach with CHArGE, and relies
on increased aperture sizes which aim to integrate all of
the light from the galaxy. In contrast to the restricted
apertures, this approach is argued to be more appropri-
ate for an unbiased extraction of the physical parame-
ters, such as stellar masses, ages and metallicities. For
the purposes of this comparison we will only focus on
the photometry extracted from the moderate apertures,
