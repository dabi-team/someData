Abstract 
Compared  with  other  imaging  modalities,  intravascular  optical  coherence  tomography  (IVOCT)  has  significant 
advantages  for  guiding  percutaneous  coronary  interventions.  To  aid  IVOCT  research  studies,  we  developed  the 
Optical  Coherence  TOmography  PlaqUe  and  Stent  (OCTOPUS)  analysis  software.  To  automate  image  analysis 
results,  the  software  includes  several  important  algorithmic  steps:  pre-processing,  deep  learning  plaque 
segmentation, machine learning identification of stent struts, and registration of pullbacks. Interactive visualization 
and  manual  editing  of  segmentations  were  included  in  the  software.  Quantifications  include  stent  deployment 
characteristics  (e.g.,  stent  strut  malapposition),  strut  level  analysis,  calcium  angle,  and  calcium  thickness 
measurements.  Interactive  visualizations  include  (x,y)  anatomical,  en  face,  and  longitudinal  views  with  optional 
overlays.  Underlying  plaque  segmentation  algorithm  yielded  excellent  pixel-wise  results  (86.2%  sensitivity  and 
0.781  F1  score).  Using  OCTOPUS  on  34  new  pullbacks,  we  determined  that  following  automated  segmentation, 
only  13%  and  23%  of  frames  needed  any  manual  touch  up  for  detailed  lumen  and  calcification  labeling, 
respectively.  Only  up  to  3.8%  of  plaque  pixels  were  modified,  leading  to  an  average  editing  time  of  only  7.5 
seconds/frame, an approximately 80% reduction compared to manual analysis. Regarding stent analysis, sensitivity 
and precision were both greater than 90%, and each strut was successfully classified as either covered or uncovered 
with high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (90%). We introduced and evaluated the clinical application of a highly 
automated software package, OCTOPUS, for quantitative plaque and stent analysis in IVOCT images. The software 
is currently used as an offline tool for research purposes; however, the software’s embedded algorithms may also be 
useful for real-time treatment planning.

Introduction 

Percutaneous  coronary  intervention  (PCI)  is  the  most  common  revascularization  procedure,  with  an  average  of 
700,000  procedures  performed  per  year  in  the  United  States  [1].  Major  calcifications  are  of  great  concern  when 
performing PCI [2], since it can lead to under-expansion and strut malapposition [3,4]. Lack of stent strut coverage 
has  been  associated  with  increased  risk  of  thrombosis  and  in-stent  restenosis  [5,6].  Therefore,  accurate  calcified 
plaque characterization and stent deployment analysis are essential for PCI evaluation and follow-up.  

Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) has rapidly evolved in the past decade and has become 
very useful for interventional cardiology [7,8]. This imaging modality not only provides quantitative measurements 
of  the  lumen,  but  also  detects  fibrous  tissue,  lipid  tissue,  calcium,  and  macrophage  deposition  [9–12].  Although 
IVOCT has many clinical advantages, a single pullback typically generates more than 500 image frames. Complete 
manual analysis of this large amount of data is time-consuming and labor-intensive, making application of IVOCT 
to real-time treatment planning challenging. We hypothesized that fully automated analysis of IVOCT images would 
provide  faster  and  comprehensive  assessment  of  plaque  to  support  treatment  decision  making.  Furthermore, 
quantitative assessment of plaque and stent deployment would allow longitudinal analysis of the same lesion, which 
may advance our understanding of lesion progression and the response to PCI treatment.  

Our group has proposed several IVOCT image analysis approaches, including plaque characterization and stent 
strut  analysis.  We  developed  an  automated  method  for  estimating  the  optical  properties  of  coronary  plaques, 
including  calcified,  fibrotic, and  lipid  atherosclerotic  plaques  [13]. We  also developed machine  and deep  learning 
methods  to  identify  fibrolipidic  and  fibrocalcific  A-lines  in  IVOCT  images  [14,15].  In  other  studies  [16–19],  we 
successfully  implemented  a  deep  learning-based  semantic  segmentation  to  characterize  coronary  plaques,  such  as 
lipid and calcification. Recently, we proposed a hybrid learning approach, which combines deep learning and hand-
crafted,  lumen  morphological  features  for  atherosclerotic  plaque  characterization  [20].  We  also  created  machine 
learning-based approaches to analyze stents in great detail, including individual strut tissue coverage [21–24].  

In this paper, we introduce the first version of Optical Coherence TOmography PlaqUe and Stent (OCTOPUS) 
analysis software, which provides highly automated, comprehensive analysis of coronary plaques in IVOCT images. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first available software for quantitative plaque analysis in IVOCT images. 
OCTOPUS  can  be  applied  to  both  offline  analysis  of  IVOCT  images  and  real-time  treatment  planning  in  clinics, 
thereby  enabling  faster,  more  accurate  treatment  decision  making.  In  addition,  OCTOPUS  can  process  multiple 
pullbacks  at  one  time,  with  versatile  functions  that  facilitate  more  comprehensive  analyses.  Users  can  load  and 
analyze  up  to  four  pullbacks  simultaneously  through  our  specially  designed  viewers.  This  feature  is  particularly 
useful for comparing baseline and follow-up pullbacks obtained at different time points. Finally, OCTOPUS can be 
used  to  advance  our  understanding  of  plaque  morphology,  including  automated  measurements  of  lumen  and 
calcification attributes, and can help determine the stent landing zone by providing cross-sectional, longitudinal, and 
en face images.

Image Analysis Methods 

This  section  briefly  describes  the  core  algorithms  included  in  the  OCTOPUS  software:  pre-processing,  stent  strut 
analysis, lumen/calcification segmentation, co-registration between pullbacks, and plaque quantification.  

2.1 Guidewire and corresponding shadow removal 

The guidewire does not provide meaningful information for plaque analysis, as it appears as a bright arc followed 
immediately by a dark shadow due to its high reflectivity. Therefore, we removed the guidewire and corresponding 
shadow  regions  using  an  accumulated  intensity  map  [25].  Briefly,  the  intensity  map  was  generated  by  adding  the 
values of pixels on each A-line, and the summation was normalized. The guidewire typically presents the upper and 
lower boundaries of the polar (r,θ) domain, which are easily distinguishable from the background. To segment these 
boundaries,  we  used  dynamic  programming  on  the  dark-bright  and  bright-dark  boundaries  [25].  Dynamic 
programming is an algorithmic technique used to solve optimization problems by breaking it down into simpler sub-
problems. We defined the guidewire detection as searching the point that maximizes the intensity differences in the 
polar (r,θ) domain. In our previous study, the detected guidewire boundary well matched the actual position for 9 
entire clinical pullbacks [25]. The guidewire and corresponding shadow were removed from further consideration.  

 
 
2.2 Lumen segmentation and pixel-shifting 

Robust lumen segmentation is important for calculation of lumen attributes and for later plaque segmentation steps. 
We used our previously developed deep learning method [17] to segment the lumen boundary in IVOCT images. 
Briefly,  the  SegNet  semantic  segmentation  model  [27]  was  used  for  lumen  segmentation  with  the  VGG-16  pre-
trained  model  [28],  and  the  results  were  post-optimized  using  the  opening  morphological  operation  with  a  kernel 
size of 5 to effectively remove small island errors. A total of 2,640 image frames from 34 pullbacks was used for 
training network. In our previous study [17], we found that deep learning lumen segmentation was superior to our 
earlier dynamic programming lumen segmentation [25]. After lumen segmentation, each A-line was pixel-shifted to 
the  left  in  (r,θ)  images,  so  that  the  lumen  border  was  at  the  same  horizontal  location  in  the  (r,θ)  array.  We  only 
considered  a  depth  of  1.5  mm  (300  pixels)  in  the  r  direction  from  lumen  border  due  to  limited  penetration  of  the 
near-infrared signal. Gaussian filtering was applied to reduce noise. The resulting image was used as the input for 
the deep learning models. Algorithm details are described elsewhere [15,16].  

2.3 Determination of major calcification lesions 

Calcified plaque is defined as a signal-poor area with sharply delineated borders in IVOCT images [29]. We used a 
3D  convolutional  neural  network  (CNN)  [18],  which  considered  8,231  frames  across  68  pullbacks,  to  classify 
frames  containing  major  calcified  lesions  prior  to  plaque  segmentation.  The  3D  CNN  is  composed  of  five 
convolutional,  five  maximum  pooling,  and  two  fully  connected  layers.  Each  convolutional  layer  included 
convolutional,  batch  normalization,  and  rectified  linear  unit  layers.  Convolutional  processing  was  done  under  a 
varying  number  of  filters  (96,  128,  256,  and  324),  with  a  filter  size  of  5x3x5  pixels  and  a  stride  of  1.  For  the 
maximum pooling layer, the pool size was set to 2x2x1 pixels. After the initial determination of major calcification, 
we applied morphological opening and closing operations using a kernel size of 3 to more efficiently detect major 
calcifications. The proposed 3D CNN model was superior to all other employed 2D models. Algorithm and training 
details are described in [18].  

2.4 Calcification segmentation 

In frames containing calcified lesions, calcified plaques were segmented using a deep learning approach, which was 
the most important and challenging task for the OCTOPUS software. Briefly, as reported previously [18], we used a 
SegNet convolutional neural network classifier consisting of five encoding and five decoding steps, followed by a 
pixel-wise classification layer. The learning parameters were initialized by transferring weights from a VGG-16 pre-
trained  network  [28],  and  adaptive  moment  estimation  optimization  was  used  for  better  training.  To  effectively 
reduce classification errors, we implemented a fully connected conditional random field [30] after segmentation. We 
chose a SegNet model because this model had better performance than other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation 
models in our dataset [16]. More than 12,000 IVOCT images including 8,231 clinical and 4,320 ex-vivo cadaveric 
images were used to train the network. The clinical dataset was acquired from 68 patients having 68 pullbacks, and 
the ex vivo cadaveric dataset was obtained from 4 heavily calcified arteries [18].  

2.5 Comprehensive stent deployment analysis 

Automated  stent  analysis  includes  stent  strut  detection,  stent  strut  classification  (covered  or  uncovered),  stent 
contour  estimation,  and  tissue  coverage  and  malapposition  quantification  [23].  For  stent  strut  detection,  the 
candidate struts were first detected using image characteristics (bright reflection followed by a dark shadow) [21]. 
Then, image features were extracted from the strut bloom and shadow, and true stent struts were classified using a 
bagged decision tree. Stent tissue coverage is defined as tissue overlying the struts >0 µm [31] and is an important 
surrogate biomarker of stent viability [6,32–35]. To examine the presence of tissue coverage on top of the strut, we 
calculated 21 hand-rafted features from center and side patches [22], and each strut was classified as either covered 
or uncovered using a support vector machine (SVM). We created the stent contour by interpolating the locations of 
each strut in (r, θ) images. Lastly, tissue coverage thickness and malapposition distance were measured from strut 
center  to  its  closest-distance  point  on  the  lumen  boundary.  The  IVOCT  data  set  used  to  create  machine  learning 
model consisted of 7,125 image frames including 39,000 covered and 16,500 uncovered struts.  

2.6 Registration of IVOCT pullbacks 

Co-registration  of  IVOCT  pullbacks  will  enable  many  studies,  including  studies  of  plaque  progression/regression 
and the effects of plaque characteristics obtained from pre-stent images on stent deployment and neo-atherosclerosis. 

 
 
We used both manual registration of landmarks (e.g., side branches or stents) and an automated approach suitable 
for  registration  within  a  lesion.  In  the  former  case,  two  identifiable  landmarks  are  marked  on  the  reference  and 
floating  pullbacks.  The  floating  pullback  is  then  offset  to  match  the  reference.  For  the  automated  approach,  the 
IVOCT data acquired in a spiral is unfolded into a continuous 2D (r, θ) array, where θ increases from 0 to Nx360 
deg and N is the number of IVOCT frames. Calcifications are segmented using a deep learning approach to create a 
1D plot of maximum calcification thickness. For a pair of IVOCT pullbacks, cross-correlation of two such curves is 
performed to find the offset, giving a peak correlation, and the offset value is used to register the 2D arrays. The 
“floating” 2D array is then reassigned to frames that match the reference pullback. A preliminary report describes 
this  method  [36]. For  cases where  we want  to register a pre-stent  pullback  to  a pullback with  a  stent, we  apply  a 
generalized  adversarial  network  approach  to  create  a  virtual  pullback  [37]  without  stent  struts  and  then  apply  the 
automated registration method.   

2.7 Plaque quantification 

Quantitative  tissue  analysis  is  essential  for  selecting  the  optimal  treatment  approach.  The  Z-offset  was  manually 
calibrated [8] to provide accurate plaque measurements. For better interpretation of plaque distribution, the lumen 
and calcification attributes were estimated from automated segmentation results. Lumen attributes include the area 
and maximum/minimum/mean diameters, while calcium attributes consist of maximum angle, maximum thickness, 
minimum depth, and length (Fig. 1).  

3  Software description 

3.1 Key functions of OCTOPUS software 

OCTOPUS was developed using MATLAB (R2019b, MathWorks, Inc) on a NVIDIA Geforce TITAN RTX GPU 
(64 GB RAM) and was compiled to a standalone package with the MATLAB Compiler v9.7. MATLAB Compiler 
Runtime v9.7 is required to run the software. Figure 2 shows the main graphical user interface (GUI) of OCTOPUS 
software. OCTOPUS is fully automatically operated through its dedicated GUI. The key functionalities included in 
the software are described below.  

Input and output. OCTOPUS supports *.oct image data (Abbott Vascular Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) as well as 
DICOM. The software is initiated by loading an IVOCT pullback using the Open File button on the top-right of the 
GUI  (Fig.  2).  For  convenience,  multiple  pullbacks  can  be  loaded.  The  outputs  of  the  software  include  grayscale 
images  in  (x,y)  and  (r,θ),  corresponding  label  images,  en  face  maps,  and  Excel  files  summarizing  all  quantitative 
assessments for further offline analysis.  

Settings.  After  loading  IVOCT  pullback(s),  the  user  selects  Mode  (Fig.  2),  which  has  three  potential  values: 
Baseline,  Follow-up,  and  Stent  Analysis.  Baseline  would  normally  correspond  to  a  pre-stent  pullback.  It  enables 
plaque characterization and visualization. There are five independent views: (x,y) anatomical, three en face (θ,z), and 
longitudinal (z). Range allows analysis and visualization of an entire pullback or a specific region of interest (ROI) 
designated with start and end frames. As shown in Fig. 3, the Follow-up mode enables review of multiple pullbacks 
at the same time in up to four viewers. Stent Analysis enables comprehensive stent deployment analysis (Fig. 4). 

Co-registration between pullbacks. Within the Follow-up mode (see Fig. 3), IVOCT pullbacks can be manually or 
automatically co-registered to the first viewer. For example, if the user manually identifies the matching frame, the 
corresponding frame is synchronized with the first viewer by clicking the PB button under the Co-registration menu. 
In  the  Automatic  mode,  the  software  automatically  detects  the  matching  frame  and  co-registers  all  the  loaded 
pullbacks. If the automatic co-registration is inappropriate, the user can manually modify the matching frame.  

Plaque  segmentation.  Plaque  segmentation  is  a  key  function  of  OCTOPUS  software  and  is  carried  out 
automatically with predefined ranges (either All or ROI) selected in the Settings menu (Fig. 2). The current version 
of  OCTOPUS  provides  lumen  and  calcium  segmentations.  The  user  can  select  the  one  of  tissue  types  among  all, 
lumen,  and  calcification  through  the  Automatic  Segmentation  menu.  Plaque  characterization  is  then  performed  by 
clicking the Run button. The software provides a progress bar during image processing, so that the user can monitor 
progress status.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Viewers. As briefly described earlier, OCTOPUS provides different types of viewers according to the selected run 
mode.  For  the  Baseline  mode  (Fig.  2),  the  left  viewer  displays  cross-sectional  (x,y)  IVOCT  images  and  enables 
manual plaque segmentation and/or editing of automated results. The three viewers on the right present en face maps 
of  angle,  thickness,  and  depth  of  calcifications  from  top  to  bottom,  respectively.  This  helps  analysts  better 
understand  the  plaque  distribution  and  readily  determine  the  stent  landing  zone.  The  bottom  viewer  shows  the 
longitudinal image overlaid with the plaque segmentation in red. The Follow-up mode aids users by simultaneously 
analyzing multiple IVOCT pullbacks using up to four viewers. For example, on the Follow-up 2 mode, the software 
provides two cross-sectional viewers (top) and corresponding longitudinal maps (bottom) (Fig. 3). The longitudinal 
map is changed according to the projection angles (red-green line) in the cross-sectional viewer, thereby helping to 
clearly identify plaque distributions.  

Image editing. OCTOPUS  provides  not  only  automated  plaque  characterization,  but  also  an  interactive  editing 
function. The Editing Functions mainly include the two sub-menus of LABEL and ADD that allow users to modify 
existing  labels  and  add  new  labels,  respectively.  The  labels  are  modified  using  the  interactive  editing  tools  (e.g., 
freehand  and  brush)  and  are  automatically  updated  and  exported.  The  user  can  add  four  classes  of  labels:  lumen, 
lipid, calcium, and other.  

Measurements.  After  plaque  segmentation,  OCTOPUS  provides  quantitative  measurements  of  lumen  and 
calcification attributes in the bottom right window (Figs. 2 and 3). All measurements are summarized for each frame 
and  exported  as  an  Excel  file  to  the  local  directory.  Additionally,  the  user  can  manually  measure  the  angle  and 
length  of  a  desired  region  on  the  cross-sectional  viewer  and  length  in z-direction  on  the  en  face  and  longitudinal 
maps. Manual measurements are annotated and saved in the current frame.  

3.2 Manual correction evaluation 

Manual correction analysis was performed on a total of 12,750 IVOCT images from 34 patients with 36 calcified 
lesions. All images were acquired with a frequency-domain ILUMIEN OCT system (St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul, 
Minnesota,  USA).  Imaging  pullback  was  done  on  Survey  mode  with  a  pullback  speed  of  36  mm/s  and  pullback 
length of 75 mm. All IVOCT images were initially reviewed by an expert reader. Exclusion criteria were poor image 
qualities due to luminal blood, unclear lumen, artifact, or reverberation. All images were manually labeled based on 
consensus  of  two  expert  cardiologists  from  the  Cardiovascular  Imaging  Core  Laboratory,  Harrington  Heart  and 
Vascular Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.  

4  Results  

We  first  relate  some  of  the  underlying  algorithms  in  OCTOPUS,  starting  with  detection  and  segmentations  of 
calcifications.  The  OCTOPUS  software  accurately  identified  calcified  plaques  in  most  situations;  an  example  is 
shown in Fig. 5. In our previous publication [18], we trained/tested the deep learning networks on a large dataset 
including 8,231 in vivo clinical images from 68 vessels and 4,320 ex vivo cadaveric images from 4 vessels. The 3D 
CNN model successfully identified the major calcifications with high sensitivity (97.7%), specificity (87.7%), and 
F1 score (0.922). A SegNet deep learning model showed reliable segmentation results with 86.2% sensitivity and 
0.781  F1  score.  An  example  of  stent  strut  detection  is  shown  in  Fig.  6.  The  algorithms  provided  reliable  stent 
deployment  analysis  in  post-PCI  pullbacks  (Fig.  6).  On  the  80  pullbacks,  including  39,000  covered  and  16,500 
uncovered struts, sensitivity and precision of strut detection were greater than 90% [21]. Each strut was classified as 
either  covered  or  uncovered  using  a  SVM,  giving  high  sensitivity  (94%)  and  specificity  (90%)  [22].  We  also 
evaluated strut tissue coverage thickness of covered struts and found better measurements than those made using the 
commercial product, with the mean error of 2.5±29.0 µm. Automated image registration is demonstrated in Figs. 3, 
7,  and  8.  As  the  automated  method  is  applicable  to  regions with  calcifications, we  also  created  a  semi-automated 
method, which was also found to work well under the direction of an experienced analyst.  

OCTOPUS  is  designed  to  provide  highly  automated,  accurate  analyses  with  the  potential  for  manual  editing. 
We analyzed 34 pullbacks and 2,723 image frames. We found that only 3.2% and 12.2% of the 2,723 automatically 
identified image frames required significant manual modifications for lumen and calcified plaque, respectively. Note 
that results were obtained using images without side branches, since current software does not account for this. In 
addition, the software missed only 6.7% of frames with calcified plaques and falsely identified only 4.5% of frames 
with  calcifications  over  all  pullbacks.  For  each  pullback,  image  loading  and  manual  setup  took  approximately  20 
seconds,  followed  by  fully  automated  processing  that  took  approximately  4  minutes  per  pullback,  or  around  0.6 

 
 
 
 
seconds  per  frame.  It  is  possible  to  setup  multiple  pullbacks  at  once  into  a  queue.  After  automated  analysis,  we 
measured  the  manual  review/editing  time  per  lesion  because  this  is  more  important  metric  for  user  intervention. 
Only approximately 3.8% of pixels within a lesion were significantly modified, leading to an average editing time of 
7.5 seconds per frame, a tremendous reduction (≈80%) compared to complete manual analysis, which requires 36.5 
seconds per frame.  

5  Clinical Research Applications 

With  OCTOPUS, we  can  uniquely  analyze  serial  imaging  data. We utilized  OCTOPUS  to  analyze  serial  imaging 
data  from  a  project  on  the  long-term  characterization  (18  months)  of  stented  vessels  with  drug-eluting  stents, 
showing  the  evolution of  neo-atherosclerosis.  Neo-atherosclerosis was defined  as  a  lipid neo-intima  or  a  calcified 
neo-intima  [38].  We  analyzed  pre-stent,  3-month  follow-up,  and  18-month  follow-up  IVOCT  images  to  evaluate 
vessel healing and development of neo-atherosclerosis (Fig. 7). Pre-stent pullback was automatically analyzed using 
the Baseline mode (Fig. 2), and OCTOPUS provided segmentation results and quantitative measurements. Follow-
up pullbacks were analyzed using the Stent Analysis mode (Fig. 4). If automated results (e.g., plaque segmentation 
and  stent  strut  detection)  were  not  acceptable,  we  manually  edited/updated  results.  We  then  loaded  all  analyzed 
pullbacks  to  the  Follow-up  mode  (Fig.  7),  registered  follow-up  pullbacks  to  pre-stent  pullback,  and  performed 
further analysis. Using OCTOPUS, we found there was a small region (3.1 mm) with uncovered struts at 3-months. 
In the exact same region, all struts were covered at 18-months. In addition, we observed negative remodeling of the 
vessel, with the lumen area shrinking from 12.0 mm2 (3-months) to 7.31 mm2 (18-months). The software was used to 
identify the evolution of neo-atherosclerosis. In Fig. 7, baseline and 3-month follow-up pullbacks showed no clear 
evidence  of  lipid.  However,  significant  neo-atherosclerosis  formation  was  detected  at  the  18-months  follow-up  of 
this same region, with a fibrous cap thickness of 0.11 mm and an arc angle of 59º containing macrophage infiltration 
(5 o’clock). We also found neo-intima development with a maximum thickness of about 0.4 mm (11-1 o’clock). In 
Fig. 7, lipid was manually annotated on the 18-month follow-up pullback using our interactive editing tool.  

As another example of serial analysis, we determined the role of calcifications in stent deployment using an ex 
vivo  cadaveric  coronary  artery  model  (Fig.  8).  We  assessed  stent  expansion  as  a  function  of  balloon  size  (e.g., 
nominal, +0.5, +1.0, and +1.5 mm) and pressure (e.g., 10, 20, and 30 atm) of non-compliant balloons. In total, we 
analyzed  14  IVOCT  pullbacks  with  more  than  7,500  image  frames.  OCTOPUS  was  able  to  automatically 
characterize  coronary  tissues  from  the  baseline  and  multiple  post-stenting  pullbacks,  co-register  pullbacks,  and 
provide quantitative measurements (e.g., lumen area, calcification angle, and calcification thickness). As shown in 
Fig. 8, we observed that the lumen area gradually increased from 4.12 mm2 to 9.24 mm2 as balloon size and pressure 
increased. We also compared the length of the malapposed lesion for the entire set of pullbacks. There were 21 mm 
and 10 mm of strut malapposition, respectively, for 2.5 mm diameter/30 atm pressure and 3.0 mm diameter/20 atm 
pressure conditions. However, the malapposition length was significantly reduced to 2.5 mm under the condition of 
3.5 mm diameter and 30 atm pressure. Comparing the four IVOCT pullbacks, we additionally observed that calcified 
plaque  is  fractured  based  upon  varying  expansion  conditions.  Calcium  fracture  was  first  observed  under  the 
condition of 3.0 mm balloon diameter and 20 atm pressure, and the size was gradually expanded. Figure 8 shows an 
example of ex vivo analysis using OCTOPUS (Follow-up 4 mode).   

6  Discussion and Conclusions 

We described the development and application of Optical Coherence TOmography PlaqUe and Stent (OCTOPUS) 
software for quantitative and visual analysis of plaques and stents in IVOCT images of coronary arteries. To the best 
of our knowledge, this is the first report of a comprehensive software package created to support a variety of clinical 
research  projects.  It  includes  important  features  and  innovations  against  currently  available  commercial  software, 
such as plaque characterization, stent deployment analysis (e.g., tissue coverage and malapposition quantification), 
and registration of pullbacks. The software not only supports single and multiple pullback analysis, but can also be 
applied to the entire pullback or specific ROIs determined by the user. OCTOPUS also facilitates analysis of plaque 
morphology through cross-sectional, longitudinal, and en face viewers. The follow-up mode enables loading of up to 
four pullbacks, allowing more efficient analysis of the baseline and follow-up pullbacks acquired at different time 
points. The user-friendly  editing  functions are built  into  the  software  to  enable  modification of  automated  results. 
The software is highly automated and fully operated through a convenient GUI.  

OCTOPUS  software  greatly  reduces  the  efforts  needed  to  achieve  highly  accurate  labeling  of  plaques. 
Typically, it takes up to 45 minutes for clinicians to manually annotate a heavily calcified pullback (depending on 
the  reader’s  experience  and  data).  OCTOPUS  can  provide  an  automated  result  for  a  single  pullback  within  4 

 
 
minutes, with manual editing completed within a couple minutes. To analyze 100 IVOCT pullbacks for example, the 
user can see automated results within 6 hours and complete the entire manual modification process in one or two 
days.  In  addition,  analysis  is  likely  more  consistent  when  using  OCTOPUS  as  compared  to  a  completely  manual 
method. 

Automated  analysis  time  could  be  significantly  improved  with  algorithm  optimization.  With  faster 
implementation,  the  software  could  help  interventional  cardiologists  more  accurately  make  real-time  treatment 
decisions. This would be of utmost importance in the clinical scenario. Once the software provides vessel anatomy, 
it  would  enable  a  proper  PCI  planning  and  selection  of  appropriate  treatment  for  the  lesion  (i.e.,  determining  the 
phenotype of the calcification, the necessity of atherectomy, and predicting difficulties during stent implantation). 
Thus,  though  OCTOPUS  is  designed  to  support  clinical  research  projects,  the  underlying  algorithms  may  have 
important clinical applications that would significantly impact patient care. Although we carefully correct frames for 
clinical research purposes, most of these corrections would not affect clinical decision making. For the most part, 
frames  containing  calcified  lesions  are  reliably  identified,  and  the  extent  of  calcification  is  segmented.  We 
previously reported that we could successfully identify calcifications with sufficient accuracy to warrant clinical use 
[16]. We performed a clinical score assessment to determine the potential impact of our method on clinical decision 
making. All cardiologists unanimously scored the highest (strongly agree), indicating strong agreement that clinical 
decision  making  would  be  the  same  for  automated  and  manual  results.  Moreover,  we  found  that  our  automated 
results [17] correctly predicted the IVOCT calcium score  of Fujino et al. [39], which was proposed to predict the 
success of stent expansion based on identification of lesions needing plaque modification (e.g., atherectomy).  

In  summary,  we  introduced  and  evaluated  the  clinical  application  of  a  highly  automated  software  package, 
OCTOPUS, for quantitative plaque analysis in IVOCT images. OCTOPUS gives good plaque segmentation results 
in  a  reasonable  computation  time.  We  found  that  our  software  has  the  potential  to  enable  faster,  more  accurate 
assessment of plaque distribution that can better inform treatment decision making. The software is currently used 
for offline clinical research purposes by cardiologists, but it could have important applications in real-time treatment 
planning.
