Abstract 

STRmix™ has been in operational use since 2012 for the interpretation of forensic DNA 
profiles.  During that time incremental improvements have been made to the modelling of 
variance for single and composite peaks, and drop-in.  The central element of the algorithm 
has remained as the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based on the Metropolis-Hastings 
algorithm. 

Regression experiments are reported comparing versions V2.3 to V2.9. 

There is a high degree of similarity in LRs for true contributors across multiple versions of 
STRmix™ that span 7 years of development (from V2.3 to V2.9). This is due to the fact that 
the underlying core models of STRmix™ that are used to describe DNA profile behaviour 
have remained stable across that time. 

Introduction 

STRmix™ has been in operational use since 2012 for the interpretation of forensic DNA 
profiles.  During that time incremental improvements have been made to the modelling of 
variance for single and composite peaks, and drop-in.  The central element of the algorithm 
has remained as the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based on the Metropolis-Hastings 
algorithm.  Some major changes to the biological and statistical models are listed below: 

• 
• 
• 

• 

• 

• 
• 
• 
• 

• 

In version 2.3 the allele and stutter variances were, themselves, allowed to vary. 
In version 2.3 the MCMC stepping was changed to the current Gaussian walk. 
In version 2.3 the HPD interval was expanded to include theta (which was also now 
able to be specified as a distribution) and MCMC variability. 
In version 2.3 the presence of relatives of the POI in the population was introduced 
into LR calculations. 
In version 2.3.07 a change was made to disallow the chains to pass through the plane 
of symmetry that exists between two donors of similar template.   
In version 2.4 forward stutter modelling was introduced. 
In versions 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 drop-in modelling was changed and refined. 
In version 2.6 generalised stutter was introduced. 
In version 2.6 limits were placed on the level of variability that could be exhibited by 
peaks with very low expected heights (Taylor Quantum Effect). 
In versions 2.7 and 2.8 a limit was placed on the size of the HPD interval generated as 
a result of allele proportion uncertainty (the limit based on population size and then 
later the minimum resampled count).

In version 2.7 the variance of a composite peak was changed from a weighted average 
of the contributing peaks to the shifted log normal model.   
In version 2.7 the starting template values per contributor within the MCMC were 
changed from a 1000 rfu to dynamic values based on the profile.  
In version 2.7 the locus specific amplification efficiency variance was added to the 
model as a parameter. 
In version 2.8 a restriction was placed on potential stutter peaks so that if drop-in was 
a more favourable explanation, then it would be invoked instead of forcing a stutter. 
In version 2.9 a restriction was added that meant an undersized stutter peak could not 
become more favourable by adding fluorescence of a type with higher peak height 
variability. 

These changes are incremental rather than revolutionary and often designed to deal with 
infrequently encountered situations, to expand the types of profiles that could be analysed, or 
reduce the amount of data pre-processing that was required.  We would expect a regression 
test of a modern version against a legacy version to give similar results for all but the fringe 
cases that the modelling improvements were designed to address.  Again, this would mean 
that testing and quality scrutiny is, to a major extent, cumulative rather than confined to one 
version.   

Method 

Experiment 1.  The original input files and parameters from the study “A sensitivity analysis 
to determine the robustness of STRmix™ with respect to laboratory calibration” [1] were 
used.  These files had been set up for V2.5 and had retained forward and back stutter but not 
double back and 2 bp back stutter.  Both V2.5 and V2.9 can, therefore, interpret these input 
files.   

The sample set containing mixtures (N = 71) with varying numbers of contributors (35 × NoC 
= 2, 36 × NoC = 3) and varying degrees of degradation was selected from the PROVEDIt set 
[2]. These had been profiled using Applied Biosystems™ GlobalFiler™ using 29 cycles of 
PCR and analysed on a 3500 genetic analyser.  These were analysed using STRmix™ 
V2.5.10 and V2.9.1 using the same settings.  LRs were calculated with propositions that 
included the POI and the remaining contributors as unknown under H1 and all contributors 
unknown under H2.  Mixtures were tested against the true donors (H1 tests) and a set of 
known non-donors (H2 tests).  

Experiment 2.  A total of 18 validation profiles from Forensic Science South Australia, that 
had been analysed in versions of STRmix™ from versions V2.3 to V2.9 were compiled and 
LRs compared. A description of these mixtures appears in Table 1.   

LRs were calculated with propositions that included all known DNA donors in H1 and all 
unknowns in H2. These propositions maximise the potential effects of variability in 
modelling. The recorded values were the sub-source point estimate (no HPD interval) of the 
unified and stratified (across Caucasian, Asian, and Aboriginal sub-populations from [3]) LR.  

A description of the mixtures used and some summary data for experiment 2 appears in table 
1.  Labelling the data in the graph led to a cluttered view where the vertical spread of log10LR 
became difficult to perceive.  We invite the reader to use the average log10LR to identify the

Plus™.

Conclusion 

There is a high degree of similarity in LRs for true contributors across multiple versions of 
STRmix™ that span 7 years of development (from V2.3 to V2.9). This is due to the fact that 
the underlying core models of STRmix™ that are used to describe DNA profile behaviour 
have remained stable across that time. Changes to modelling that have occurred in STRmix™ 
are generally to: 

Improve the performance of STRmix™ in modelling fringe cases, 

• 
•  Expand the level of functionality in STRmix™ to accommodate a greater pool of 

DNA profiles of varying behaviour. 

Taking this concept further, the main bulk of validation work that has been carried out on 
previous versions of STRmix™ are as applicable for current versions as they were for the 
version in which they were originally generated. The only exception to this is for those 
profiles that fall into the categories of fringe cases or previously uninterpretable profiles that 
the modelling improvements were targeted to address.

TH01 stutter regression is SR = 0.007541 + 0.001577 × LUS.  Hence the expected SR for the 
8 allele is about 0.020.  The observed SR is 0.12.  STRmix™ V2.5 has all the weight on

The difference is that STRmix™ V2.9 is allowing drop-in for the 7 whereas V2.5 is not.  
Neither model the 7 as a large stutter.

The analysis was run as NoC = 2 because that was the assignment from the epg.  When run 
this way H1 needs a drop-in of one of 19, 25, or 26

The difference is that STRmix™ V2.9 is allowing the 21,22 (it is aligned with the -1,21) by 
allowing drop-in of the 25.  STRmix™ V2.5 has allowed drop-in of the 19 only.
