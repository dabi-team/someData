     Abstract. The proposed UWB antenna covers mobile   communications  (GSM, 
     EDG, UMTS(3G), LTE(4G) ‚Ä¶) and wireless networks (WIFI, WiMAX),  with- 
     in a theoretical bandwidth defined from 780MHz to 4.22GHz. The  UWB anten- 
     na is designed and realized on a FR-4 substrate with an electrical  permittivity 
     of 4.4. It presents a 98.75% average  analytical efficiency and an  omnidirection- 
Œµr
     al  radiation within the previous bandwidth. The  impedance excitation   port   is  
     fixed at    50 Ohm according with the SMA impedance used in the practical part. 
     The measured results are in good agreement with those  obtained using CST and  
     ADS software‚Äôs. The measured bandwidth, defined from 980MHz   to   4.2GHz,      
     presents an efficiency   of 94.14%.  Furthermore, the practical radiation diagram 
     and the excitation port impedance stay the same as that the simulation one.

1      Introduction 

  The communication systems communicate with others via a device called antenna. 
There  are    three      major    antenna    types,    the    monomodal      antenna  [1],    the  
multiband antenna [2] and  the ultra-wideband  antenna [3][4]. The  first  antenna 
type, works with a just one  precise frequency,  the second  type can  catch a finite 
number  of  waves at a precise  frequency  and the  third  antenna  type   offers a 
possibility    to    catch    all    waves    ambient  in  a  defined  wideband.  This  paper  is 
focused on the UWB antenna, which is derived from [5]. In this reference [5], the 
antenna is defined by a coplanar waveguide excitation, and is addressed to [4 ‚Äì 10] 
GHz  applications,  so  this  antenna  can‚Äôt  cover  the  mobile    communications    and  
wireless  networks.      Our  purpose  is  to  make  this  antenna  able  to  be  operational 
within the last networks bandwidth. For that, we  brought   a radical edit,  which   
consists   to   change  the coplanar waveguide to a microstrip line feeding, where 
the  ground  plan  has  a  particular  form  getting  after  modification  of  the  coplanar 
waveguide and it‚Äôs printed in the bottom side of the substrate. In the other hand, the   
patch   printed   on the top side, has been also modified by  increasing very carefully 
all   parameters   values    and  make the  feeding line longer  than  what it  was  and  

this  length has   to  be  equal to

width. With all  these  modifications,  we've  got an antenna  frequency response  going 
from [0.77 ‚Äì 4.2] GHz, which is required. In the following, we present the proposed 
antenna structure and the CST simulation results and we deduce its electrical equiva-
lent circuit which going to be simulated by ADS software. The experimental and sim-
ulation results are then compared. Finally, we give the realized antenna model and the 
practical performances [6].   

2    The proposed UWB antenna simulation 

In this part, the most important antenna parameters are simulated and analyzed to 

precise the proposed antenna performances. 

2.1  The proposed antenna model 

The proposed antenna model, is a patch antenna, such as the strip face contain six 
resonators, each one, radiates in a precise frequency. The thickness of this proposed 
antenna  is  1.7  mm,  the  used  substrate  is  the  FR4(
=4.4),  and  the  total  width  and 
height are 78 mm and 120.75 mm respectively. the ground plan has a particular form, 
presented in the Figure 1, and the strip side [6] is depicted in the Figure 2. This par-
ticular  ground  form  permits  to  widen  the  frequency  bandwidth,  and  pass  from  a 
multiband antenna to an UWB antenna generally. In this context, the dimension val-
ues  of  our  proposed  antenna,  which  give  a  perfect  UWB  response,  are  listed  in  the 
Table.1.

2.2  Simulated return loss 

The return loss parameters S11 is too important for being able to extract the perfor-
mance  of  this  antenna.  Its  magnitude  is  given  according  with  the  incident  and  the 
reflected power in level to the first port of the antenna. The Figure 3 shows the repre-
sentation of this antenna in term of the scattering parameters.

Fig. 3. Representation of the Scattering matrix 

a1  and b1 are defined as the incident and the reflected power respectively. Then, the 
return loss is given by the following expression (equation 1).  

(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9) (cid:10)

(cid:11)(cid:12)
(cid:13)(cid:12) (cid:14)

(1) 

Most  of  times  we  fix  the  minimum  acceptable  front  S11  level  to  -10  dB,  however, 
when the reflected power rises up to the 10% of the incident power, this level of re-
flection is considered like a maximum acceptable reflection level, so a good antenna 
response is defined when the reflected power being less than the 10% of the incident 
power, in the other way, when S11 become less than or equal to -10 dB 
Our proposed antenna is simulated by CST software, the corresponding S11 is depict-
ed in the Figure 4. 

Fig. 4.     Reflection coefficient variation

As we can see, the acceptable band is given according with the S11 parameter, such as 
this favorable band starts from around 780 MHz to 4.2 GHz with an S11 less than -15 
dB, that means there are the minimum possible reflections in this bandwidth.  

2.3  Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) 

In  general  case  the  VSWR  has  to  be  less  than  2,  that  means  almost  90%  of  the 
power has to be radiated and only nearly 10% of the power has to be reflected back. 
So, the VSWR value can be seen to be within 1 to 2 in the operating range. The simu-
lation results for VSWR for the frequency range from [0.780 - 4.2] GHz is shown in 
the Figure 5.

2.4  Radiation diagram 

The  radiation  diagram  shows  in  tridimensional  coordinate  the  radiation  intensity 
variation at a fix distance into the direction ((cid:1), (cid:2)). This diagram has to be independent 
to the distance, and depends only to the observation direction ((cid:1), (cid:2)) [7]. We present in 
the Figure 6, the radiation diagram of our proposed UWB antenna at nine frequencies.

2.5  Equivalent electronic circuit 

The electrical equivalent circuit of this antenna must have the same response than 
the last simulation result by CST. For completing this task, we used the ADS software 
for representing the architecture of the electronic elements used. This circuit is formed 
in base of inductors, capacitors and resistors. The values of these electronic elements 
are  given  by  theoretical  equations,  which  are  getting  from  Gauss  theory  (capacitor 
value equation 2), Ampere theory (inductor value equation 3) and the resonance con-
dition (resistor value equation 4). 
These equations are given according with the width (W), the length (d) and the thick-
ness (h) of the resonator blocks of the antenna [8]. For our model, we have exactly six 
blocks, as shown in Figure 7.  

Fig. 7.       Antenna Resonator blocks 

It‚Äôs  clearly  seen,  that  the  proposed  antenna  consists  of  six  RLC  resonators  (Fig.  8). 
The resistor is due to the obstacle that the excitation current will encounter, and this 
obstacle is defined by the change in shape of the patch, the capacitor C is due to the 
spacing  between  the  ribbon  and  the  ground  plane,  the  inductor  L  is  due  to  the  de-
crease in the width of the patch.

2.6  Comparison and discussion 

The  equivalent  electronic  circuit  elements  are  given  according  with  the  antenna 
dimension parameters, so its response has to be the same as the simulation one. The 
Figure 10, shows that both responses are too much closers and we can say that they 
are duplicated within the frequency range [0.8 ‚Äì 4.1] GHz with an S11 value less than  
-15 dB.

3.3  Comparison and discussion 

The Figure 13 allows to make a comparison between the measured and the simu-

lated results and then to discuss the similarity of these both results.

Fig. 13.  Simulation and the practical response (S11) of the antenna 

As we can see, both responses are too similar, with a similarity rate of around 94%, 
the  major  difference  is  located  in  the  frequency  range  (0.78  ‚Äì  1.1)  GHz,  a  second 
difference is around 2 GHz, due to the imperfection of the material used for the reali-
zation of this antenna. 

4  Conclusion 

We have designed, simulated and realized a UWB patch antenna on FR4 substrate 
hybrid technology. The performances of the antenna are studied using CST and ADS 
software‚Äôs. The obtained results show that the simulations and the measurements are 
in  good  agreement.  the  simulated  and  the  measured  S11  responses  are  in  good  con-
cordance inside the frequency bandwidth [0.78 ‚Äì 4.2] GHz. 
With a measured bandwidth defined from 980MHz to 4.2GHz, this antenna could be 
used for a large domain of applications, such as radars, mobile communications, wire-
less network applications‚Ä¶
