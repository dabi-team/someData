Abstract

Radio science data collected from NASA’s Deep Space Networks (DSNs)
are made available in various formats through NASA’s Planetary Data Sys-
tem (PDS). The majority of these data are packed in complex formats, mak-
ing them inaccessible to users without specialized knowledge. In this paper,
we present a Python-based tool that can preprocess the closed-loop archival
tracking data ﬁles (ATDFs), produce Doppler and range observables, and
write them in an ASCII table along with ancillary information. ATDFs are
primitive closed-loop radio science products with limited available documen-
tation. Early in the 2000s, DSN deprecated ATDF and replaced it with the
Tracking and Navigation Service Data Files (TNF) to keep up with the evo-
lution of the radio science system. Most data processing software (e.g., orbit
determination software) cannot use them directly, thus limiting the utiliza-
tion of these data. As such, the vast majority of historical closed-loop radio
science data have not yet been processed with modern software and with
our improved understanding of the solar system. The preprocessing tool pre-
sented in this paper makes it possible to revisit such historical data using
modern techniques and software to conduct crucial radio science experiments.

1. Introduction

The radio signals between spacecraft and Earth-based stations enable us
to conduct crucial science experiments. The technique of precisely measuring
the properties of radio signals provides a distinct advantage for obtaining
information about solar system bodies, including the atmosphere[1, 2, 3],
gravity ﬁeld[4, 5, 6], rotational state[7, 8, 5], interior structure[9, 10, 11], and
ephemerides [12]. Furthermore, radio science observations are crucial for
studying solar dynamics, including solar wind and the solar corona [13], as
well as testing fundamental physics[14, 15]. NASA’s Planetary Data System
(PDS) actively archives these observations and makes them publicly available
to scientists for analysis. However, most of these Deep Space Network (DSN)
data are archived in very complex formats that bound the usage of data
outside the radio science experts.

The paper focuses on the archival tracking data ﬁles (ATDFs), which are
the earliest closed-loop radio science products packed in the DSN’s TRK-
2-25 format[16]. The ATDF format was used to archive crucial primitive
radio science data from several NASA missions (e.g., Magellan, Galellio).
Given the current advancement in computing power, a better understanding
of our solar system, and continuous evolution in precise orbit determination
software, making it worthwhile to revisit such historical data with modern
tools (e.g, MONTE [17], GINS [18]). However, ATDF data cannot be directly
accessed by most data processing software due to its complex format. As
such, preprocessing software is required to unpack the binary ﬁelds of the
ATDF data and convert them into useful observables. To our knowledge,
there are no open-source tools available for preprocessing such closed-loop
radio science data, which limits their useability.

2

Intending to address this need, we developed a Python-based tool to
preprocess ATDF data and convert them into Doppler and range observables
in accordance with the Moyer formalism[19]. The tool was written in Python
and tested on several operating systems to maximize its usability.

2. Formulation and software description

We developed software using the widely adopted Python programming
language. All ATDF formatted ﬁles archived since 1986 can be preprocessed
with this software. It unpacks the densely packed binaries in accordance with
the TRK-2-25 interface speciﬁcation[16] and preprocesses them using Moyer’s
formalism[19, Chapter 13]. The software currently supports high/low rate
Doppler, range, and programmable frequency (ramp) data types.

2.1. Doppler data

Among the types of data available in an ATDF format, Doppler is the
most common. It contains a time history of high- and/or low-rate Doppler
counts, typically at the rate of 1-10 times per second. In accordance with
user-provided Doppler count time (see Section 2.4), the software computes
the high-precision Doppler counts and converts them to Doppler shift ob-
servables. A number of radio science investigations can be conducted by
using these observables, such as determining gravity ﬁelds, probing interior
structure, rotational dynamics, and measuring ephemerides of spacecraft.
The software creates three-way, two-way, and one-way Doppler observables
as follows:

fobservable(t) =

fcb
|fcb|

×

(cid:20)Dcount(t2) − Dcount(t1)
Tc

(cid:21)
− fbias(t)

Hz

(1)

where, fobservable is the Doppler observable at time t, fcb is the constant
bias frequency, Tc is the user provided count time, Dcount is the Doppler
count, t2 = t + 0.5*Tc, t1 = t - 0.5*Tc, and fbias is the bias frequency at
time t. The bias frequency, fbias, is calculated as follows [19]:

fbias(t) = M 2 ∗ fref (t) − C2 ∗ ftransponder + fcb Hz,

for one-way Doppler

fbias(t) = fcb Hz,

for two-way and three-way Doppler

(2)

where, fref is the sky-level reference Doppler frequency at time t, M 2
is the spacecraft transponder ratio [20], and C2 is the spacecraft downlink

3

frequency. The reference Doppler frequency, fref , is calculated as follows [19,
Chapter 13, section 13.2]:

For S-band:

For X-band:

fref (t) = 96 × fosc(t) Hz,

fref (t) = 32 × fosc(t) + 6.5 × 109 Hz,

(3)

(4)

For X-band, 34-meter high eﬃciency DSN antennas (15, 45, and 65):

fref (t) = 32 × (4.68125 × fosc(t) − 81.4125 × 106) + 6.5 × 109 Hz,

(5)

where, fosc is the reference oscillator frequency.
For Ka-band:

fref (t) = 1000 × fosc(t) + 1.0 × 1010 Hz,

(6)

2.2. Range data

The range is another data type that is occasionally available in the
ATDF. It gives direct access to the spacecraft’s position relative to the
ground and provides the most powerful constraints for constructing plan-
etary ephemerides[12]. Range observables can be one-way or two-way, and
they are created as follows:

Robservable = Rmsr − REdelay + Zcorr − SCdelay, RU

(7)

where, Rmsr is the range measurement, REdelay is the ranging equipment
delay, Zcorr is the DSN antenna Z-correction, and SCdelay is the spacecraft
delay. Range observables are usually given in Range Units (RU). The con-
versions between RU to seconds are given in [19, Chapter 13, section 13.5.2].
Although the conversion of RU into meters depends on the signal frequency,
the RU can roughly be approximated as 1 meter ≈ 3 RU.

2.3. Ramp data

The ATDF ﬁle also provides the time history of DSN transmitted frequen-
cies. The transmitted frequency can be constant or time-varying (ramped).
When the receiver is ramped, the software also creates a ramp history ﬁle.
It contains information about the ramp start and end times, the reference
frequency at the beginning of the ramp, the rate at which the ramp frequency
changes, the uplink band, and the corresponding DSN.

When the ramp start frequency is not known at the sky level, it is com-
puted by Equations 3 and 4 for the S-band and X-band, respectively, and
the ramp rate is determined by the ﬁrst derivative of these equations:

where, frate is the rate of change of ramp frequency and ˙fosc is oscillator

2.4. Software architecture and functionalities

Figure 1 lays out the architecture of the ATDF software, where atdf2ascii.py

is the main python script to execute the software. Based on the header infor-
mation of the input ATDF ﬁle, software detects the relevant format of the bi-
naries and unpack them using either atdf reader I.py or atdf reader II.py
script. The Doppler, Range, and Ramp classes use these unpacked
records and convert them into observables. The software creates two out-
put ﬁles upon successful execution: one that contains the Doppler and range
observables (Table 1), and the other one contains the ramp frequency history
(Table 2). The following command-line options can be used to preprocess an
ATDF ﬁle:

Python atdf2ascii.py -i input_file.tdf [options ...]

5

where, input file.tdf is the TRK-2-25 formatted input data ﬁle and

the options are described as follows:

• --count time [-c]: this option can be used to specify the Doppler
count time, Tc, in seconds, at which Doppler measurements must be
compressed. It accepts one or more values (separated by commas). In
the event that more than one count time is speciﬁed, the last value in
the list will be preferred if the requested count time is not found in
the original records. By default, the count time at which the original
data is recorded will be used. To select the count time, the type of
radio science experiment must be considered, and the selection should
be made in a way that maintains the key features of the radio signal
over the entire count interval. For instance, in experiments analyzing
atmospheric dynamics, it may be necessary to use a shorter count time
(1 second or less) to account for the low frequency ﬂuctuations in the
observed signal. On the other hand, for overly sensitive experiments,
such as testing fundamental physics, better sensitivity can be achieved
with a longer count time (e.g., 1000 seconds). For further reading, see
[21, 22].

• --proc count [-p]: this option limits the number of CPUs used
in multi-processing. By default, half of the available CPUs will be
utilized.

• --xd1: this option precludes the processing of one-way Doppler mea-

surements.

• --xd2: this option precludes the processing of two-way Doppler mea-

surements.

• --xd3:

this option precludes the processing of three-way Doppler

measurements.

• --xr1: this option precludes the processing of one-way Rang measure-

ments.

• --xr2: this option precludes the processing of two-way Rang mea-

surements.

2.5. Mars Global Surveyor ATDF data
3. Results

Here we are processing two independent ATDF data ﬁles: one is from
NASA Magellan mission when the spacecraft was in orbit around Venus and
the other is from NASA Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission when the
spacecraft was in orbit around Mars.

3.1. Magellan ATDF data

The Magellan mission was launched by NASA in 1989 to map the sur-
face of Venus and estimate its gravitational ﬁeld [23, 24, 25]. The Magellan
spacecraft reached Venus in August 1989 and began collecting data from
September 1990 (cycle 1) through October 1994 (cycle 5). The ATDF data
are the primary closed-loop radio science data acquired by the spacecraft
and are available through the Geoscience Node of the Planetary Data Sys-
tem. For illustration purposes, we randomly selected the ATDF ﬁle1 and
preprocessed it through our software.

The Magellan data ﬁle consisted of records that spanned from one-tenth
to 60 seconds. In Figure 2, we show the raw values of the Doppler observables
and receiver ramp frequencies that we derived from the ATDF ﬁle. These
Doppler observables were constructed by using count times, Tc, of 10 and 60
seconds with the following command:

The colors in the ﬁgure indicate diﬀerent sets of uplink and downlink
bands, while the symbols represent the DSN stations. Two ﬁles were pro-
duced from the above command: one contains the observables with accom-
panying information such as time tags, DSN stations, uplink and downlink
bands, and delays (Table 1), and the other contains the time history of the
ramp frequencies (Table 2). These measurements are vital to gravity investi-
gations, allowing the reconstruction of the spacecraft’s orbit and estimating
the geophysical attributes of the body.

3.2. Mars Global Surveyor ATDF data

Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) was a NASA mission to study Mars, launched

in 1996. The primary phase of the mission began in 1999, and a wealth
of data were sent back to Earth until 2006 [26, 27]. Similar to Magellan,
ATDF was the primary closed-loop product of the MGS spacecraft. At the

11

PDS, however, data ﬁles with ATDF format were not often archived; in-
stead, a simpler form of closed-looped data, Orbit Data Files (ODFs)[28],
were archived2. These ODFs were created from ATDFs and provide direct
access to the observables (similar to the output from the proposed software).
Depending on the investigation, MGS ATDF data was recorded down
to one-tenth of a second. Figure 3, shows the raw values of the Doppler
observables and receiver ramp frequencies. Using a ﬁxed count time, Tc,
of 60 seconds, the following commands were used to construct the Doppler
observables:

Python atdf2ascii.py -i 9066071a.tdf -c 60 --xd1

where --xd1 ﬂag excluded one-way Doppler observables.

3.3. Validation

To validate the constructed values of the raw observables, we compared
them to predicted values. Following the realistic Moyer’s formulation, the
predicted values were obtained using positions and velocities of the space-
craft and bodies of the solar system. We assessed these positions and veloc-
ities through archived ephemerides of the spacecraft3 and DE438 planetary
ephemerides[29].

Figure 4 shows the Doppler residuals for the two spacecraft. The root-
mean-square values of residuals for Magellan and MGS spacecraft are 22 mHz
and 26 mHz, respectively. The remaining trends in the residuals are presum-
ably due to errors in the spacecraft trajectory and a mis-modeling of the
measurement model, which does not account for spacecraft attitudes, media
delays, antenna positions, etc. Nevertheless, any error in the constructed val-
ues of the raw observables would have been straightforward to distinguish, as
those errors would usually be associated with oﬀsets. Therefore, the residual
values shown in Figure 4 are indicative of an accurate retrieval of the raw
observables.

4. Impact

Radio science data are the primary data sets used for deep space naviga-
tion. Over the past half-century, these data have been used for deep space
exploration to reveal the geophysical properties of solar system bodies. The
ATDF format was deprecated by the DSN in the early 2000s and replaced

craft. These residuals were computed by comparing the raw and predicted observables (see
Section 3.3).

with the TNF TRK-2-34 format[30] to accommodate the evolution of the
radio science subsystem. It was until then the primary closed-loop radio sci-
ence data were used widely for navigation, science, and creating a simpler
closed-loop data format, ODF[28].

These historical data are still as valuable today as they were when they
were ﬁrst acquired. Given the current advancement in computing power, a
better understanding of the solar system, and very precise software provide a
valid reason to re-analyze such data sets. NASA, for instance, has announced
two Discovery missions to visit Venus by late 2020. As such, re-analyzing
Magellan radio science data with modern tools would be vital to the planning
and design of these missions.

Despite being valuable science data, there are no open-source tools for
preprocessing complex radio science data. The tool presented in this paper
enables users to preprocess closed-loop data and create observables that can
be further analyzed with modern orbit determination software. We believe
that this tool will make historical radio science data more accessible to users
outside of radio science community. We also expect that it will become a
starting point for those who are interested in analyzing such type of data in
the future.

5. Conclusions

This paper describes a Python-based tool that can preprocess the closed-
loop radio science data packed in the ATDF format. In addition to producing
Doppler and range observables, this tool also produces information such as
receiver ramp frequency history, uplink and downlink bands, DSN stations,
delays, etc., and writes to an ASCII table. Using the command-line option
-c, the user may produce Doppler observables at either a ﬁxed or variable
count time. A comparison was made between derived Doppler observables
and the predicted observables for validation. This comparison shows no
apparent oﬀset in the residuals, verifying the success of creating Doppler
observables.

The observables, along with ancillary information, are essential for recon-
structing spacecraft orbits and conducting radio science experiments. To our
knowledge, there are no open-source tools available for preprocessing closed-
looped radio science. Therefore, this tool increases the usability of historical
and valuable data and allows users to process them using modern techniques
and software.
