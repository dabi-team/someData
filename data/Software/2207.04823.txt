ABSTRACT
Behavioral models enable the analysis of the functionality of soft-
ware product lines (SPL), e.g., model checking and model-based
testing. Model learning aims to construct behavioral models. Due
to the commonalities among the products of an SPL, it is possible
to reuse the previously-learned models during the model learning
process. In this paper, an adaptive approach, called PL∗, for learning
the product models of an SPL is presented based on the well-known
𝐿∗ algorithm. In this method, after learning each product, the se-
quences in the final observation table are stored in a repository
which is used to initialize the observation table of the remaining
products. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two open-source
SPLs and the learning cost is measured in terms of the number
of rounds, resets, and input symbols. The results show that for
complex SPLs, the total learning cost of PL∗ is significantly lower
than that of the non-adaptive method in terms of all three metrics.
Furthermore, it is observed that the order of learning products af-
fects the efficiency of PL∗. We introduce a heuristic to determine
an ordering which reduces the total cost of adaptive learning.

1 INTRODUCTION
Models are the foundations of many rigorous analysis techniques
in engineering in general and software engineering in particular.
Behavioral models specify how a system behaves as a result of
interacting with its user and environment. Examples of behavioral
models include variants of state machines and sequence diagrams.
Behavioral models are often non-existent or outdated and one needs
to reconstruct them from implementations in order to enable further
analysis [12]. Model learning is a mechanized approach that comes
to rescue in such situations [41].

In software product lines, model learning is challenged by vari-
ability [15, 43]: one needs to learn behavioral models over the
variability space and if performed crudely, this can be practically
impossible. The key to overcome this challenge is to reuse the
learned models and their underlying data structures while moving
across the variability space [42]. Adaptive model learning [17] is
fit for this purpose, because its algorithms are precisely designed
to reuse the results of the past queries, as well as the structure of
the behavioral models in the subsequent learning process [11].

In this paper, we design an adaptive learning algorithm for soft-
ware product lines, called 𝑃𝐿∗, and evaluate its efficiency against its
non-adaptive counterparts. Two important components of a model
learning algorithm are the membership queries (checking for the
output to a given sequence of inputs) and the equivalence queries
(verifying the model learned hitherto). The main factors in evalu-
ating the efficiency of a model learning algorithm are the number
of learning rounds (and equivalence queries), the number of resets,
and the total number of input symbols used in learning [2, 11, 41].
We evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm on two subject systems.
We statistically evaluate our results (with 3-wise sampling, based on
earlier experiments [12], and with different product orderings) and
observe, with high statistical confidence, that PL∗ is more efficient
than the non-adaptive approach. Hence, we affirmatively answer
the following research questions:

RQ1 Does adaptive learning lead to fewer learning rounds and

equivalence queries?

RQ2 Does adaptive learning lead to fewer resets?
RQ3 Does adaptive learning lead to fewer total number of input

symbols?

In standard (non-adaptive) model learning, the order of learning
the products is immaterial, since no information is brought forward
to learning the next products. In our adaptive learning method, we
observe a stark difference in terms of efficiency among different

orders. We define and formalize a heuristic to provide an efficient
product ordering in the learning process and statistically establish
a correlation between our proposed ordering and the efficiency
of the learning algorithm (in terms of the total number of resets
and the total number of input symbols) as the answer to our last
research question:

RQ4 How does the choice of product ordering influence the effi-

ciency of the learning process?

To our knowledge, this is the first application of adaptive model
learning to software product lines (we refer to Section 2 for an anal-
ysis of the related work). It is a first step in this direction, which
will pave the way for a line of research extending various model
learning techniques to a family-based approach. This natural exten-
sion would require parameterizing the data structure we use in our
approach (called observation tables [2]) with feature expressions.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we re-
view the related work and position our research within the broader
fields of model learning and software product lines. In Section 3,
we recall some basic concepts and definitions from the aforemen-
tioned fields. In Section 4, we present our adaptive model learning
algorithm. In Section 5, we outline our empirical evaluation method-
ology and describe the design of our experiments. In Section 6, we
discuss the results of our experiments and reflect on the threat
to the validity of our results. In Section 7, we conclude the pa-
per and present the directions of our future research. A package
containing the source code, models, and test scripts is available at

2 RELATED WORK
In this section, we review the related work in three broad areas:
adaptive model learning [5, 11, 17, 21, 45, 46], machine learning in
SPLs [10, 12, 28, 31], and feature model mining [1, 20, 34].

Adaptive Model Learning. Adaptive model learning [17] is an exten-
sion of traditional model learning by reusing pre-existing models.
Groce, Peled & Yannakakis [17] are among the first to reuse inac-
curate models for adaptive model learning and model checking.
The authors’ results suggest that adaptive learning is especially
useful when model updates are led by small changes with limited
impact [17]. Our results corroborate their observation in the setting
of software product lines; namely, we show that adaptive learn-
ing is more efficient when the order of products comprises fewer
new non-mandatory features added in each step. Windmüller et
al. [45] show that adaptive learning can be used to periodically
build models from evolving complex applications. Also, they show
that reusing separating sequences derived from models of previous
versions can steer the learning process to find maintained states
[45]. Huistra, Meijer, & van de Pol [21] report that the performance
of adaptive learning is influenced by the SUL’s complexity, the size
of its update, and the quality of suffixes. Additionally, the authors
report evidence that, if a set of reused separating sequences has
low state distinguishing capacity, then irrelevant queries should
be expected [21]. Chaki, Clarke, Sharygina & Sinha [5] presented
an approach for efficiently model checking software upgrades by
revalidating sequences from reused observation tables [5]. More re-
cently, Damasceno et al. [11] showed that existing adaptive learning
techniques are prone to performance issues when there are large

differences between the reused and updated model. To address this
issue, they introduced a novel adaptive learning technique that
gradually revalidates and reuses sequences and outperforms state-
of-the-art adaptive learning techniques [11]. Our results crucially
build upon these earlier results and bring them to a new domain:
software product lines provide a specific paradigm for adaptive
learning, where the choice of adaptations can be controlled by the
product sampling order. Our work differs from these by focusing
on the reuse of multiple observation tables in an observation table
repository and is to our knowledge the first attempt to lift adaptive
model learning to the scope of software families. Yang et al. [46]
present a way to combine the results of passive- and active model
learning [46]. Our work differs from this piece of work in that we
consider active model learning; the combination of adaptive active
and passive learning for product families is a promising area for
future work.

Machine and Model Learning in SPLs. Several studies applied ma-
chine learning [31, 38] and model learning [10, 12] in software
product lines. For an extensive literature review on machine learn-
ing applied to SPLs, we refer the interested reader to Pereira et
al. [31]. Lesoil [28] have recently showed that variability can be
present at multiple layers of a system (e.g., at the hardware, soft-
ware, and input data levels) and raise concerns about challenges in
the adoption of machine learning principles in variability analysis.
Family-based modeling approaches have been developed to enable
efficient model-based testing of SPLs without exhaustively going
through each and every product. Nevertheless, the creation and
maintenance of family models are still difficult and time-consuming
[30]. To mitigate this, Damasceno et al. [10, 12] introduced fam-
ily model learning as a means for building behavioural variability
models for SPLs. Using a benchmark set of 105 product models,
the authors showed that succinct family models can be learned
by matching and merging state machine models [12], particularly
when there is a high degree of reuse among the SULs [10]. Addi-
tionally, they show that feature coverage criteria (particular, up to
3-wise) can alleviate the costs of learning family model by sampling
product sets that cover the behavior of product families. These
results have sparked the interest of the SPL community in pursuing
further investigations at the intersection of model learning and
variability analysis [13]. Our work advances this research line by
reusing observation tables across multiple products. Particularly,
using adaptive learning techniques is a novelty of our approach.

Feature Model Mining. Feature models are a key asset in variability
management and analysis [4]. Using SAT- [27] or SMT [37] solvers,
feature models are amenable to automated reasoning. However, as
an SPL may also be built using extractive and reactive approaches
[3], SPL projects may initially lack feature models [20]. To address
this issue, reverse engineering concepts have been used to (semi-
)automate the construction of feature models from sets of product
configurations [1, 20, 34]. Our work complements the role of such
structural variability model learning techniques (aka feature model
mining) by providing an efficient means to extract behavioral vari-
ability models. The integration of these two sets of techniques is a
promising line of future research.

3 BACKGROUND
In this section, some of the terms used in this paper are described.
The software product lines are briefly explained. Some notations
for modeling an SPL and its products are defined. The non-adaptive
model learning process is explained. Some of the metrics used for
evaluating the efficiency of model learning are defined. Also in this
section, the product sampling concept is briefly described.

3.1 Software Product Lines
A software product line (SPL) is a set of software products that have
a common set of features and are designed for a specific requirement
[9]. An SPL is defined by a set of features 𝐹 and a feature model
[10, 12]. A feature-model [26, 35] is a structural variability model
representing the hierarchical structure of the SPL features. Each
product 𝑝 consists of a subset of the SPL features. The set of valid
product configurations is specified by the feature model. In this
representation, features are classified into mandatory and optional
types. Mandatory features are present in all valid configurations
by default. From a group of alternative features, only one of them
can be present in each product. When a set of features are defined
using or, each product may contain one or more of them [12, 26].
Figure 1 shows the feature model of a sample SPL. In this figure,
A and C are mandatory features and B is an optional feature. The
features D and E are alternatives. F, G and H form an ‘or’ group of
features. This SPL contains 28 valid product configurations.

3.2 Finite State Machines
A finite state machine (FSM) [16] is a widely used behavioral model
which is defined as the tuple 𝑀 = ⟨𝑆, 𝑠0, 𝐼, 𝑂, 𝛿, 𝜆⟩. In this definition,
𝑆 is the set of states and 𝑠0 is the initial state (𝑠0 ∈ 𝑆). The set of
input alphabet is represented by 𝐼 and the set of outputs is denoted
by 𝑂. The transition function 𝛿 determines the next state, 𝑠2 ∈ 𝑆,
assuming that the FSM is in state 𝑠1 ∈ 𝑆 and the input 𝑎 ∈ 𝐼 is
presented (𝛿 (𝑠1, 𝑎) = 𝑠2). The output function is represented by
𝜆 which is a mapping from a pair of a state and an input to an
output. The state machines learned by the existing model learning
methods are deterministic FSMs. In a deterministic FSM, for each
state and input alphabet, there is at most one transition and one
output [11, 41].

3.3 Model Learning
Model learning [41] is a method used to construct the behavioral
model of a software system in the form of a state machine. Model

learning is classified into two types: passive and active. In passive
learning, different runs of software (e.g., log files) are used for
learning a behavioral model of the software. In active learning,
however, a model is learned by interacting with the system under
learning (SUL) through various types of queries and observing the
resulting outputs. The 𝐿∗ algorithm [2] proposed by Dana Angluin,
is a seminal example of active model learning, where two types of
queries are used: a membership query (MQ) is used to determine the
output sequence for a given input sequence. An equivalence query
(EQ) is used to ask if the constructed hypothesis 𝐻 is language-
equivalent to the SUL. The query results are stored in an observation
table (described below), and the learning is performed in rounds, in
each of which a hypothesis is constructed [2, 11, 41].

3.3.1 Observation Table. An observation table is defined as a triple
OT = (𝑆, 𝐸,𝑇 ), where 𝑆 ⊆ 𝐼 ∗ is a finite prefix-closed set of prefixes
(transfer sequences); 𝐸 ⊆ 𝐼 + is a finite set of suffixes (separating
sequences) and 𝑇 : 𝐼 + × 𝐼 + → 𝐼 + is a function such that for each
𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 ∪ 𝑆.𝐼 and 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸, 𝑇 (𝑠, 𝑒) is the SUL’s output suffix of size |𝑒 |
for the 𝑠.𝑒 input sequence. An observation table can be represented
as a 2-dimensional array, where each row is a subset of 𝑆.𝐼 with
a representative 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆.𝐼 , and each column is a sequence 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸.
An observation table is closed if for all 𝑠1 ∈ 𝑆.𝐼 , there exists a
prefix 𝑠2 ∈ 𝑆 such that row (𝑠1) equals row (𝑠2). An observation
table is consistent if for all 𝑠1, 𝑠2 ∈ 𝑆 such that row (𝑠1) = row (𝑠2),
row (𝑠1.𝑣) equals row (𝑠2.𝑣) for all 𝑣 ∈ 𝐼 [2, 11, 41].

3.3.2 The 𝐿∗ Algorithm. In this section, Angluin’s 𝐿∗ algorithm
[2] is described. At the beginning of this algorithm, sets 𝑆 and 𝐸
are initialized to {𝜖} and the initial 𝑇 values are obtained by posing
MQs. The following steps are repeated until the observation table
is consistent and closed:

• If the observation table is not consistent, the algorithm finds
𝑠1, 𝑠2 ∈ 𝑆, 𝑣 ∈ 𝐼 and 𝑒1 ∈ 𝐸 such that row (𝑠1) = row (𝑠2)
and 𝑇 (𝑠1.𝑣, 𝑒1) ≠ 𝑇 (𝑠2.𝑣, 𝑒1). Then, 𝑣.𝑒1 is added to 𝐸 and
the new values of 𝑇 are calculated by posing MQs.

• If the observation table is not closed, the algorithm finds
𝑠1 ∈ 𝑆 and 𝑣 ∈ 𝐼 such that row (𝑠1.𝑣) ≠ row (𝑠) for all 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆.
Then, 𝑠1.𝑣 is added to 𝑆 and the new values of 𝑇 are obtained
using MQs.

When the observation table is closed and consistent, the algorithm
constructs a hypothesis 𝐻 and poses an EQ to verify it. If 𝐻 is
correct, the learning algorithm terminates. If the hypothesis 𝐻 is
not correct, a counterexample is provided. A counterexample is
an input sequence in which the result of 𝐻 is different from the
result of the SUL [2, 11, 41]. Then, the counterexample is used to
update the observation table by adding prefixes or suffixes (for
which several heuristics have been proposed) [23].

The 𝐿∗

𝑀 [36] is an active model learning algorithm for learning
mealy machines using the settings of 𝐿∗. In 𝐿∗
𝑀 , the observation
table is defined as OT = {𝑆𝑀, 𝐸𝑀,𝑇𝑀 } and is initialized using
𝑆𝑀 = {𝜖} and 𝐸𝑀 = 𝐼 [36]. In this paper, the 𝐿∗
𝑀 algorithm is used
to perform the experiments.

3.4 Product Sampling
Product-based behavioral analysis of an SPL, can be costly due
to the exponential number of valid configurations. Using sample-
based approaches may result in increasing the efficiency of the SPL
analysis. In these approaches, a subset of valid products is used to
cover the behavior of an SPL. Products whose behavior has already
been covered by other products are not included in the sample
[39]. The T-wise [24] method is one of the sampling techniques
applicable in the SPL context. In this method, valid combinations
of T-features are used to cover the T-wise interactions of features
in the SPL [12, 24, 32].

4 THE PL* ALGORITHM
In adaptive model learning, the transfer sequences and the separat-
ing sequences in the observation tables of the existing models are
reused to initialize the observation table of the new model [11]. In
our approach, we build upon an adaptive learning algorithm [11],
and apply to learn the FSM models of a set of products sampled
from an SPL. Assume Sample = (𝑝1, 𝑝2, . . . , 𝑝𝑛) is a sequence of 𝑛
products sampled from an SPL.

In this algorithm, otRepository is defined as a set of observation
tables learned from earlier products. To refer to these observation
tables, we use the notation OT 𝑖 = (𝑆𝑖, 𝐸𝑖,𝑇𝑖 ) for the observation
table of product 𝑖. At the beginning of the learning process, the
otRepository is empty. The PL∗ algorithm consists of the following
steps:

(1) First, the FSM of 𝑝1 is learned using a non-adaptive learning
method (e.g., using the 𝐿∗
𝑀 algorithm). We only deviate from
𝐿∗ by initialising the initial set of suffixes (i.e., 𝐸1) with the
alphabet of the product 𝑝1. (We do the same for all other
subsequent products, as well, i.e., we add their alphabet to
their initial set of suffixes.)

(2) Once the 𝐿∗

𝑀 algorithm successfully terminates, the result-
ing observation table OT 1 is added to the otRepository.
Therefore, otRepository equals {OT 1}.

For each 𝑖 ∈ {2, . . . , 𝑛}, the following steps are iteratively
repeated:

(3) The model of product 𝑝𝑖 is learned using adaptive 𝐿∗

𝑀 . In
this step, the observation table of 𝑝𝑖 is initialized using
otRepository = (OT 1, . . . , OT 𝑖−1). A sequence is “defined
in the alphabet of 𝑝𝑖 ” if it solely comprises input symbols in
the alphabet of 𝑝𝑖 . To initialize the OT 𝑖 , the set of sequences
in (cid:208)𝑗 ∈ {1,...,𝑖−1} 𝑆 𝑗 which are defined in the alphabet of 𝑝𝑖 ,
is considered as the initial value of 𝑆𝑖 . The set of sequences
in (cid:208)𝑗 ∈ {1,...,𝑖−1} 𝐸 𝑗 which are defined in the alphabet of 𝑝𝑖 ,
are added to 𝐸𝑖 (note that the alphabet of 𝑝𝑖 is initially added
to 𝐸𝑖 by default).
(4) Once adaptive 𝐿∗

𝑀 terminates, OT 𝑖 is added to the otRepository
and at the end of this step, otRepository equals (OT 1, . . . , OT 𝑖 ).

A schematic representation of the proposed adaptive learning
method is shown in Figure 2. In this figure, 𝑀𝑖 is the model learned
for the 𝑖-th product (𝑝𝑖 ). In this figure, arrows from PL∗ processes
to the observation table repository show that the observation table
of the recently learned product is stored in the repository. The

arrows starting from the repository show the sets of sequences in
the repository which are used to initialize the observation table
of the new products. After learning the model of each product,
the learned model is incorporated into a family model (a feature-
annotated behavioral model of the software product line [14]). The
two processes of learning the product models and updating the
family model can be performed concurrently.

Figure 2: A schematic representation of the proposed adap-
tive learning method

Based on the results of the experiment described in Section 6.1,
we observed that the product learning order can affect the efficiency
of the PL∗ method. The product learning order can be random or it
can be determined using heuristic methods. To find a good learning
order, it is necessary to determine which characteristics of a learning
order result in increasing the efficiency. Based on the results of the
experiments (Section 6.1) and observing learning orders with high,
medium, and low efficiency, a heuristic is presented to determine
the desired learning orders. In the experiments, we observed that
when the number of new non-mandatory features that are added
by each product is small, the efficiency of the PL∗ method increases.
Using this observation, we present a heuristic to provide an ordering
which decreases the total cost of learning.

Suppose the number of non-mandatory features of an SPL is 𝐹
and a sample of size 𝑛 from this SPL is available for learning. The
product learning order 𝑂 = ⟨𝑝1, 𝑝2, ..., 𝑝𝑛⟩ is a sequence of products
in this sample. If 𝑖 is smaller than 𝑗, the FSM of 𝑝𝑖 must be learned
earlier than the FSM of 𝑝 𝑗 . The parameter 𝐷 is defined as follows.

(1)

(cid:40)0,
(cid:205)𝑛

𝐷 =

if 𝐹𝑖 = 0
if 𝐹𝑖 ≠ 0

,

𝑖=1

1
𝐹𝑖
In Equation 1, 𝐹𝑖 is the number of new non-mandatory features
added by 𝑝𝑖 , i.e., the number of non-mandatory features in 𝑝𝑖 not
present in any product 𝑝 𝑗 , where 1 ≤ 𝑗 < 𝑖. The reason for using
1
in this formula is that the added cost of learning decreases as
𝐹𝑖
the number of new non-mandatory features increases (i.e., the
difference between 1 and 1
is larger than the difference between 1
4
2
and 1
5

).

5 EMPIRICAL EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed adaptive learning method,
a set of experiments is performed. These experiments are designed
to answer the following questions by comparing the quantitative
metrics between the PL∗ method and the non-adaptive learning
method:

RQ1 Does adaptive learning lead to fewer total number of rounds

and equivalence queries?

RQ2 Does adaptive learning lead to fewer resets?
RQ3 Does adaptive learning lead to fewer total number of input

symbols?

These quantitative metrics arise from the way model learning al-
gorithms operate: MQs are the simple and basic building blocks
to build a hypothesis about the system under learning and hence,
their total number is indicative of how long it takes before the
hypotheses are constructed. EQs are much heavier than MQs and
their total number heavily influences the performance. In order to
put these two types of queries together, one needs to factor in the
substantial difference in the size of these two types of queries; this
is best achieved by counting the total number of input symbols,
which gives us a very natural indicator of the overall performance
of the algorithm [41] (RQ3).

While performing these queries, sometimes a reset operation is
needed to bring the FSM to a known state and pose further queries.
This operation is known to be very costly and is often avoided as
much as possible in learning algorithms. To reset a SUL, it may be
necessary to completely restart the system and re-initialize many
of its software components. Therefore, performing a reset may take
a long time [18, 19]. Hence, we use the total number of resets as
another efficiency metric for our comparison (RQ2).

5.1 Subject Systems
To evaluate the proposed adaptive learning method, we need ac-
cess to SPLs with well-defined behavioral (e.g., FSM or labelled
transition system) and structural models (e.g., Feature Models and
the alphabet of each feature). It must also be possible to obtain the
FSM of any valid configuration from these SPLs. The tested SPLs
must be complex enough to involve a number of rounds and have a
reasonably large number of queries in order to allow for a meaning-
ful comparison. According to the mentioned characteristics, two
open-source SPLs are used in the experiments:

5.1.1 The Minepump SPL. The Minepump SPL is presented in [7, 8]
and is a simple mine-pump controller that includes 9 features (6
non-mandatory features). The feature model of this SPL is shown in
Figure 3 [7]. The featured transition system of this SPL is provided
in [12]; Using this featured behavioral model, it is possible to obtain
the FSM of any valid configuration from this SPL. Sampling is
performed using the 3-wise method. The sample created from this
SPL contains 15 products. The FSMs of the products in this sample
have a minimum of 9 states and a maximum of 21 states, and their
average number of states is 13.86.

Figure 3: The feature model of the Minepump SPL [7]

represents a feature and provides a specific functionality. The I/O
transition system of each component is provided at [29].

In this paper, a simplified version of the BCS SPL is used. The
feature model of the simplified version of the BCS SPL is shown in
Figure 4 (taken from [29] with minor modifications). The simpli-
fied version contains 12 features (6 non-mandatory features). The
product FSMs are constructed using the following steps:

(1) The I/O transition system of each component is converted

to a finite state machine (FSM).

(2) The FSMs of the components corresponding to the features
of each product are merged to construct the FSM of that
product.

The sample created from this SPL using the 3-wise method contains
16 products. The FSMs of the products in this sample have a mini-
mum of 14 states and a maximum of 864 states, and their average
number of states is 117.25.

5.2 Experiment Design
To perform the experiments, a subset of the valid configurations
of each subject SPL is used. The samples are produced using the
T-wise product sampling method [24] and the Chvatal algorithm
[6]. For sampling using T-wise method, the value of 𝑇 is set to 3. In
[12], it is shown that in T-wise sampling method, the use of T = 3
results in a more precise family model than in cases where T = 1
or T = 2. In this sampling method, using 𝑇 greater then 3 is not
cost-effective [12]. Sampling is performed using the FeatureIDE
[40] library. The FSMs of all products in each sample are learned
using the PL∗ method and the non-adaptive learning method. The
total learning cost is calculated for each learning method.

In these experiments, model learning is performed using the
ExtensibleLStarMealyBuilder class of the LearnLib [33] library ver-
sion 0.16.0. In the non-adaptive learning method, before applying
model learning to each product, the observation table is initialized
using 𝑆𝑀 = 𝜖 and 𝐸𝑀 = 𝐼 , where 𝐼 is the input alphabet of the
product [36]. In the adaptive learning method, the observation ta-
bles are initialized using the method explained in Section 3 (the
PL∗ algorithm). Model learning is performed using the following
parameters:

• The equivalence oracle type is WP, which is an established
and structured method for detecting faults (i.e., incorrectly
learned states and transitions).

• The observation table closing strategy is CloseFirst.
• Caching is not used.

5.1.2 The BCS SPL. The Body Comfort System (BCS) SPL [29] is
an automotive software system of a Volkswagen Golf model, whose
original feature model has 27 features. Each component in this SPL

To evaluate the experiment results, statistical tests are performed
using the SciPy [25] library of Python. The Matplotlib [22] library
is used to visualize the results. The experiments show that in the

PL∗ method, the order of learning the products affects the total cost
of learning. To more accurately evaluate the results, the following
experiments are performed:

5.2.1 Comparing the Learning Methods. To compare the efficiency
of the PL∗ method with the non-adaptive learning method, a sample
of 200 different random learning orders is produced for each subject
SPL. Each learning order is considered as a permutation of the
products in the sample of products. Considering each of the sampled
learning orders, model learning is performed using the PL∗ method
and the non-adaptive learning method. The following methods are
used to generalize the results by catering for the following random
exogenous variables in the learning process:

(1) Using random orders for the input alphabet
(2) Using random orders for the initial prefixes
(3) Using random orders for the initial suffixes

The total amount of the learning cost metrics for each learning
method is calculated for each combination of random values. The
total value of each metric for each learning order is calculated using
the sum of the values of that metric for learning the model of all
products in that order. The amount of metrics in the PL∗ method
and the non-adaptive learning method are compared using the
one-sided paired sample T-test.

5.2.2 The Effect of Learning Order. To evaluate and quantify the
effect of learning order on the efficiency of the PL∗ method, for
each subject SPL two learning orders are considered: one learning
order with a high learning efficiency and one with a low learn-
ing efficiency. To obtain these learning orders, the results of the
previous experiments are sorted in ascending order based on the
total number of resets, the total number of input symbols and the
total number of rounds, respectively. In the resulting table, the first
row corresponds to the order with the highest learning efficiency
and the last row corresponds to the order with the lowest learning
efficiency among the orders tested. Considering these learning or-
ders, the product models are learned using the PL∗ method and the
total amount of metrics are calculated. This experiment is repeated
50 times for each order. The amount of metrics for these learning
orders are compared using the non-paired T-test.

6 RESULTS
In this section, we first present the results of the experiments per-
formed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed adaptive learn-
ing method in comparison to the non-adaptive algorithm. Then,
we show how different orderings of the products affect the total
cost of learning in the adaptive algorithm. Finally, we discuss the
obtained results and the threats to their validity. To make the dia-
grams clearer, the scale of each diagram is adjusted according to
the values in that diagram. In this section, the average and standard
deviation values of the number of resets and the number of input
symbols are rounded to the nearest whole number. For the metrics
shown in Tables 1 to 7, the standard deviation in the non-adaptive
learning method is zero and hence, is not shown in the table. To
highlight the amount of improvement made by the PL∗ method,
“improvement percentage” is defined. For each learning cost met-
ric, if 𝑚 is its value in the PL∗ method and 𝑚′ is its value in the
non-adaptive learning method, the improvement percentage is cal-
culated as (1 − 𝑚
𝑚′ ) ∗ 100%. For each specific learning cost metric,
if the improvement percentage is positive, it means that using the
PL∗ method improves learning efficiency in terms of that metric.
On the other hand, if the improvement percentage of some metric
is negative, it shows that using the PL∗ method reduces learning
efficiency in terms of that metric.

6.1 Comparing the learning methods

(RQ1-RQ3)

In this experiment, the total amount of the learning cost metrics is
calculated for 200 random orders using the PL∗ method and the non-
adaptive learning method. In the non-adaptive learning method,
the values of the learning cost metrics are exactly the same for all
orders tested, obviously. Figure 5 shows the distribution of the total
number of resets for the subject SPLs. The distribution of the total
number of input symbols is shown in Figure 6. In these figures, the
blue diagrams show the box-plots of the metrics for the PL∗ method.
The values of metrics for the non-adaptive learning method are
represented by the horizontal line on top of each box plot.

The values of the efficiency metrics in the PL∗ method and the
non-adaptive learning method are compared using the one-sided
paired sample T-test. Tables 1, 2, and 3 summarize the results of
these tests for the number of rounds, the total number of resets,
and the total number of input symbols, respectively. In the table
for each metric, the “Ratio” column shows the ratio of the value

Another effective factor in the efficiency of the model learning
algorithms is the length of queries. To estimate this parameter, the
total number of input symbols can be used, which is the sum of the
input symbols used in MQs and in the implementation of EQs [41].
Table 3 shows that using the PL∗ method reduces the total number
of input symbols by about 12% in the Minepump SPL and by about
6% in the BCS SPL compared to the non-adaptive learning method.
The above results show that the total number of input symbols in
the PL∗ method is significantly less than that of the non-adaptive
learning method.

Therefore, in these experiments, the use of PL∗ method increases
the learning efficiency in terms of the number of learning rounds,
the total number of resets and the total number of input symbols.
The number of resets and input symbols are evaluated for MQs and
EQs separately.

Tables 4 and 5 summarize the results of the experiments for
the MQ resets and the MQ input symbols, respectively. In the
Minepump SPL, using the PL∗ method increases the number of
MQ resets by about 7%. In the BCS SPL, the increase in the number
of MQ resets is approximately 18%. The PL∗ method increases the
number of MQ input symbols by about 9% in the Minepump SPL
and by approximately 22% in the BCS SPL.

Tables 6 and 7 show the experiment results for the EQ resets and
the EQ input symbols, respectively. In the Minepump SPL, using
the PL∗ method reduces the number of EQ resets by about 13%. In
the BCS SPL, the amount of reduction in the number of EQ resets
is approximately 7%. The PL∗ method decreases the number of EQ
input symbols by about 13% in the Minepump SPL and by about 6%
in the BCS SPL.

The results of the experiments show that the PL∗ method can
improve the learning efficiency in terms of the total number of
rounds, resets and input symbols. The PL∗ method increases the
number of MQs. This adaptive learning method reduces the total
cost of learning by reducing the number of EQs. Tables 4 and 6 show
that in the subject SPLs, the number of EQ resets is at least one
order of magnitude higher than the number of MQ resets. Similarly,
Tables 5 and 7 show that the number of EQ input symbols is at
least one order of magnitude higher than the number of MQ input
symbols. These results indicate that the impact of EQs on the total
cost of learning is much greater than the effect of MQs. Therefore,
in both subject SPLs, the PL∗ method increases the total learning
efficiency.

In the PL∗ method, the observation table of the product under
learning is initialized using sequences from the previously learned
models which are defined in its alphabet. Therefore, it makes the
initial observation table more similar to the final observation table
(the observation table after learning). As a result, the PL∗ method
can decrease the number of rounds. This learning method is suitable
for SPLs which are complex enough that the model learning of some
of their products requires more than one round. We have not yet
evaluated the effect of caching on the learning methods.

6.2 The Effect of Learning Order (RQ4)
To evaluate the effect of learning order on the PL∗ algorithm, from
each subject SPL, two learning orders are selected: one order with a
high learning efficiency (order 1) and one order with a relatively low

Figure 5: Distribution of the total number of resets

Figure 6: Distribution of the total number of input symbols

of that metric in the PL∗ method to the value of the same metric
in the non-adaptive learning method; Ratio values are rounded to
three decimal places.

Table 1 shows that in the Minepump SPL, the use of the PL∗
method reduces the number of learning rounds by about 39% com-
pared to the non-adaptive learning method. In the BCS SPL, the
number of rounds decreases by about 23%. The results of one-sided
paired sample T-tests show that in the tested SPLs, the number of
learning rounds in the PL∗ method is significantly less than that of
the non-adaptive learning method (𝑝-value < 0.01).

Another metric which is evaluated in these experiments, is the
total number of resets, which is the sum of the number of reset
operations of the MQs and the EQs. Table 2 shows the results of
these experiments for the total number of resets. In the Minepump
SPL, the total number of resets in the PL∗ method is approximately
13% lower than that of the non-adaptive learning method. In the
BCS SPL, the amount of the reduction in the number of resets is
approximately 7%. The calculated 𝑝-values show that the total num-
ber of resets in the PL∗ method is significantly less than the amount
of this metric in the non-adaptive learning method. Therefore, in
the tested SPLs, using the PL∗ method reduces the total number of
queries in the learning process.

learning efficiency (order 2), as explained in 5.2.2. Considering these
orders, the model learning is performed using the PL∗ method. The
experiment is repeated 50 times for each of these learning orders.
The results of order 1 and order 2 are compared using the two-sided
unpaired T-test.

In the Minepump SPL, the total number of learning rounds in all
repetitions of this experiment is 15 for order 1 and 22 for order 2.
However, to learn these models using the non-adaptive learning
method, 30 rounds are required. As mentioned earlier, the efficiency
of the non-adaptive learning method does not depend on the learn-
ing order of products. In the BCS SPL, the total number of rounds
in the PL∗ method is 16 for order 1 and 18 for order 2, while the
number of rounds in the non-adaptive learning method is 22.

Table 8 shows the results of these experiments on the total num-
ber of resets. In the Minepump SPL, the average of the total number
of resets is 3714556.240 for order 1, while the value of this metric
is 3898983.160 for order 2. The 𝑝-value of the two-sided unpaired
T-test is 2.875e-14. In the BCS SPL, the average of the total number
of resets is 76182731.480 for order 1 and 81718889.180 for order 2.
In this experiment, the calculated 𝑝-value is 3.281e-42. Therefore,
in these experiments, the total number of resets in order 1 is signifi-
cantly different from that of order 2. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of the total number of resets in the experimented learning orders.
Table 9 summarizes the results of the experiments on the total
number of input symbols. In the Minepump SPL, the average of
the total number of input symbols is 24166589.700 for order 1 and
25374188.260 for order 2. The 𝑝-value of the two-sided unpaired
T-test is 1.421e-14. In the BCS SPL, the average of the total number
of input symbols is 728779454.060 for order 1 and 778246372.540
for order 2. The calculated 𝑝-value in this experiment is 2.071e-40.
Therefore, the total number of input symbols in order 1 is signif-
icantly different from the same metric in order 2. Figure 8 shows

Figure 7: Distribution of the total number of resets in the
experimented learning orders

the distribution of the total number of input symbols in the experi-
mented orders.

The results show that in the PL∗ method, the order of learning
the products can affect the efficiency of model learning in the SPL
context.

6.2.1 How to Determine the Order of Learning. As mentioned ear-
lier, the order of learning products can affect the efficiency of the
PL∗ method. In this experiment, the use of parameter 𝐷 to deter-
mine the product learning order in the PL∗ method is evaluated.
Using the equation 1, the parameter 𝐷 is calculated for all 200 learn-
ing orders in Experiment 6.1. The Pearson correlation coefficient
𝑟 between the parameter 𝐷 and the learning cost metrics and its
𝑝-value is calculated.

Table 10 summarizes the results of these experiments for the
total number of resets. The Pearson correlation coefficient between

the parameter 𝐷 and the total number of resets is -0.305 for the
Minepump SPL (𝑝-value = 1.127e-05) and -0.430 for the BCS SPL
(𝑝-value = 2.183e-10). Figure 9 shows the diagrams of the total
number of resets vs. parameter 𝐷 and its regression line.

The correlation coefficient between the parameter 𝐷 and the total
number of input symbols and its 𝑝-value is summarized in Table
11. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the parameter 𝐷
and the total number of input symbols is -0.301 for the Minepump
SPL (𝑝-value = 1.484e-05) and -0.404 for the BCS SPL (𝑝-value

against the parameter 𝐷 and its regression line are shown in Figure
10.

The above experiments show that the order of learning the prod-
ucts can affect the efficiency of the PL∗ method. In these experi-
ments, it is observed that the total learning efficiency usually in-
creases if the number of new non-mandatory features that are added

rameter 𝐷

simultaneously is small. Using this observation, the parameter 𝐷 is
defined as a heuristic to find an order which increases the efficiency
of learning. Experimental results show that there is a mild negative
correlation between the value of 𝐷 and the total number of resets.

There is also a mild negative correlation between the value of 𝐷
and the total number of input symbols. Therefore, it is possible to
determine the proper order for learning a subset of products using
the PL∗ method. However, for all learning orders tested, the PL∗
method is more efficient than the non-adaptive learning method.

6.3 Threats to Validity
Because the PL∗ method has been tested on a small number of case
studies, the results may be biased according to the characteristics
of the subject systems. This is a threat to generalization of our
result. To mitigate this threat, we plan to test the PL∗ method on
more subject systems. Evaluating the PL∗ method in case studies
featuring the evolution of behavior both in space and time is a
way to test more and larger subject systems (considering evolution
in time will enrich our set of case studies and make our method
applicable to a larger problem space). We also see a threat to the
generalization of the product ordering heuristic due to our limited
set of subject systems; with a large set of case studies, we see a
possibility of (statistically) learning the optimal order as well.

The use of a particular T-wise sampling algorithm (with T = 3,
based on [12]) may pose another threat for the generalization of our
results. We plan to extend our results by considering other values
for T and more advanced sampling algorithms [44].

We captured the random exogenous variables involved in our
experiments, such as the order of alphabet symbols and prefixes in
learning, and minimized their threats to the validity of the results
by taking a large sample. This threat is sufficiently mitigated for
the current experiment and we did not observe any significant
influence of these random variables in our results to plan a further
mitigation.

To minimize the threats to conclusion validity, we opted for the
most general statistical tests in our experiment design: for compar-
ing the learning methods, we used one-sided paired sample T-tests.
For comparing and evaluating the learning orders, we started off
with an unpaired sample T-test but strengthened the results by us-
ing the Pearson correlation coefficient for measuring the correlation
of learning efficiency with the value of the parameter 𝐷.

7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented an adaptive model-learning approach
that reuses the learned information about the behavior of products
while covering the variability space. It has been shown through
an empirical evaluation on two subject systems that our proposed
adaptive approach significantly outperforms the standard model
learning approach based on Angluin’s L∗ algorithm. For our com-
parison, we have used the number of resets and the total number of
input symbols, as well as the number of equivalence and member-
ship queries. Additionally, we studied the role of product ordering
in learning efficiency and provide a heuristic through defining a
parameter that was shown to correlate with learning efficiency for
our subject systems.

Performing more experimental evaluation with other subject
systems is among our priorities for future work. We plan to extend
our technique to a family-based learning process by extending the
learning data structures to ones annotated with feature expressions.
Other model learning techniques have been proposed recently,
which can be extended to the adaptive and family-based setting
following the same recipe. It was observed that the randomness in
the order of prefixes and suffixes affects the efficiency of the PL∗
method, while it does not affect the efficiency of the non-adaptive
learning method. Evaluating the effect of randomness of the order of
prefixes and suffixes on the efficiency of the PL∗ method is another
line of our future research works.
