Earth’s temperature variability can be partitioned into internal and externally-forced components. Yet, underlying mech-
anisms and their relative contributions remain insufﬁciently understood, especially on decadal to centennial timescales.
Important reasons for this are difﬁculties in isolating internal and externally-forced variability. Here, we provide a
physically-motivated emulation of global mean surface temperature (GMST) variability, which allows for the separa-
tion of internal and external variations. To this end, we introduce the “ClimBayes” software package, which infers
climate parameters from a stochastic energy balance model (EBM) with a Bayesian approach. We apply our method to
GMST data from temperature observations and 20 last millennium simulations from climate models of intermediate to
high complexity. This yields the best estimates of the EBM’s forced and forced + internal response, which we refer to
as emulated variability. The timescale-dependent variance is obtained from spectral analysis. In particular, we contrast
the emulated forced and forced + internal variance on interannual to centennial timescales with that of the GMST
target. Our ﬁndings show that a stochastic EBM closely approximates the power spectrum and timescale-dependent
variance of GMST as simulated by modern climate models. This demonstrates the potential of combining Bayesian
inference with conceptual climate models to emulate statistics of climate variables across timescales.

Understanding the statistical properties and sources of
Earth’s surface temperature variations is of great impor-
tance in climate science. To this end, we analyze the
variability of global mean surface temperature (GMST)
with a simple stochastic energy balance model (EBM).
With Bayesian methods and spectral analysis, we sepa-
rate internally-generated and externally-forced contribu-
tions to GMST variations on different timescales in state-
of-the-art climate model simulations. Our results show
that a stochastic EBM can emulate the variability of more
complex climate models. The combined use of Bayesian in-
ference and conceptual climate models therefore provides
a versatile tool to advance the understanding of internal
and forced variability in Earth’s dynamical system.

INTRODUCTION

Climate variability describes the spatial and temporal vari-
ations in the mean and higher order statistics of climate pa-
rameters, and is of vital importance for living conditions on
Earth1. While many sources of natural variability exist, an-
thropogenic inﬂuences clearly dominate the recent trend in
global mean surface temperature (GMST). To characterize
variability, it is typically partitioned into internal and exter-
nal components. Internal variability arises from intrinsic cli-

mate system processes such as oceanic and atmospheric circu-
lation. External sources include changes in radiative forcing,
for example, from solar irradiance, volcanic eruptions, and
greenhouse gases. Despite a general agreement of the total
simulated and observed GMST variability over the Common
Era (0-2000 CE)2,3, uncertainties remain about the mecha-
nisms and magnitude of internal and external variations4–6,
especially on decadal to centennial timescales3,7.

Simple mathematical models help understand climate
variability8–10 and can be used to emulate climate variables
from more complex model simulations. Most general, the
time evolution of a forced climate parameter X(t) is described
by ˙X(t) = A (t, X(t), F(t)) for an arbitrary operator A and
external driver F(t). We consider X as corresponding to the
GMST, for which many studies have formulated physically-
motivated approximations of A . One pivotal approach is
centered around the idea of balancing incoming and outgo-
ing radiation8,9, later extended to a stochastic energy balance
model (EBM) by Hasselmann 10 . This approach assumes the
climate system close to equilibrium, showing only small ﬂuc-
tuations. Then, A can be approximated by a linear stochastic
operator8,9:

tions. The feedback parameter λ := ˜λ /C is the inverse of the

The response to the stochastic term ε(t) approximates internal
variability.

The stochastic EBM (1) laid the basis for attributing anthro-
pogenic warming11,12. It was applied and modiﬁed to study
climate sensitivity13–16, climate and ice cap stability17–20, re-
gional temperatures21–23, Glacial/Interglacial cycles18,24, and
future projections25,26. Moreover, the EBM (1) has been ex-
tended to so-called multibox EBMs, which are based on mul-
tiple ocean layers, referred to as boxes. The layers serve to
approximate the vertical heat transfer and the integrated re-
sponse to forcing over long periods15,27–30. Key advantages
of EBMs are their computational efﬁciency and comparatively
easy interpretation.

To estimate uncertain parameters of conceptual climate
models from data, Bayesian frameworks have become in-
creasingly popular31–35. In comparison to other methods for
inferring climate parameters, such as maximum likelihood
estimation, Bayesian approaches have the advantage of pro-
viding full posterior distributions. The methods compute the
posterior means and credible intervals (CIs) of uncertain pa-
rameters θ conditioned on target data y while including prior
knowledge on θ . Central to this framework is applying Bayes
theorem

p(θ |y) =

p(y|θ )p(θ )
p(y)

,

(2)

with likelihood p(y|θ ), prior p(θ ), marginal p(y) and pos-
terior p(θ |y). We denote all probability densities by p and
distinguish them by their arguments. Combining Bayesian in-
ference with conceptual climate models typically also yields
the posterior of the model’s ﬁt to the data.

With the ability to quantify ﬂuctuations across timescales,
power spectral analysis has improved the understanding
of climate variability3,36–39. Simple climate models have
been combined with spectral analysis to explain timescale-
dependent variability. For example, Fredriksen and Rypdal 30
use a non-stochastic multibox EBM to study temporal scal-
ing of temperature time series. Related works examine fu-
ture projections25 and climate sensitivity40. Yet, the potential
of combining stochastic multibox EBMs, Bayesian inference
and spectral analysis to study the magnitude of unforced and
forced variability across timescales remains untapped.

Here, we examine and separate timescale-dependent inter-
nal and externally-forced contributions to the GMST vari-

the last millennium (850-1850 CE) as simulated by 20 cli-
mate models of intermediate to high complexity. To this end,
we combine a stochastic two-box EBM (section III A) with
Bayesian inference (section III B) and spectral analysis (sec-
tion III C). We present the “ClimBayes” software package41
for Bayesian inference of climate parameters, which ﬁts the
stochastic EBM to GMST data. This results in the best esti-
mate of the forced and samples of the forced + internal EBM’s
temperature response. First, we demonstrate our analysis on
the example of historical observations (section IV A) and then
apply it to the considered set of last millennium simulations
(section IV B). Section IV C contrasts power spectra of the

2

ﬁtted EBM with and without internal variations. Comparing
the internal and forced variance on interannual to centennial
timescales (section IV D), a stochastic two-box EBM captures
most variations of more comprehensive model simulations.
We summarize and discuss the potential for physics-informed
emulation of GMST data and separation of variance contribu-
tions across timescales in sections V and VI.

II. DATA

Our study relies on annual GMST and corresponding radia-
tive forcing time series. We use full-forced last millennium
runs from climate models of varying complexity (Table I). We
analyze ten simulations with atmosphere-ocean general circu-
lation models (AOGCMs), considered in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5)42. Moreover, we use ten
simulations with Earth system models of intermediate com-
plexity (EMICs) that are part of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment
Report (AR5)43 and described by Eby et al. 44 . The AR5
EMICs represent single simulations, except for CLIMBER2
and LOVECLIM V.1.2, which are ensemble means and de-
noted by “(mean)” in the following. To compare variability in
single ensemble members to that of the ensemble mean, we
use the ﬁve available ensemble members LOVECLIM V.1.2
(E1-E5).

The transient radiative forcing applied to these simulations
follows the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project
Phase III (PMIP3) protocol45. For AR5 EMICs, we take the
total estimated radiative forcing provided by Eby et al. 44 . For
CMIP5 simulations, we use the radiative forcing from recon-
structions of well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and
N2O), volcanic aerosols, total solar irradiance, and land use
changes as provided by Schmidt et al. 45. We neglect orbital
forcing, which is assumed to play a negligible role for GMST
variability over the last millennium. To remove potential cli-
mate drifts46, the simulated GMST is linearly detrended prior
to analysis. Accordingly, detrending is also applied to the cor-
responding forcing time series.

We use the GMST from HadCRUT547 observations (1850-
2000 CE) to demonstrate the developed workﬂow of our
Bayesian stochastic energy balance framework. As estimates
for radiative forcing during the historical period, we consider
the“PEA” land use (Pongratz et al. 48 ), “CEA” volcanic forc-
ing (Crowley et al. 49 ), “SBF” solar irradiance reconstruction
(Steinhilber, Beer, and Fröhlich 50 ) patched into Wang, Lean,
and N. R. Sheeley 51 , and greenhouse gas concentrations from
Schmidt et al. 45.

A. Stochastic two-box energy balance model (EBM)

The stochastic multibox EBM25,29,30 extends the one-
dimensional linear operator from equation (1) by multiple ver-
tical layers, approximating the heat exchange between surface
and deep ocean layers. In matrix notation, the model reads30

C

dT
dt

(t) = KT (t) + F (t) + (cid:15)(t) .

(3)

For N boxes, T (t) is an N-dimensional vector, describing the
temperature of each box. By convention, T1 corresponds to the
temperature of the uppermost and TN to the temperature of the
lowermost box. Accordingly, C is a diagonal matrix with the
effective heat capacity Cii of each layer (i = 1, ..., N). K is a
N-dimensional tridiagonal matrix, parameterizing the surface
temperature response and vertical heat transfer (Appendix A).
The time-dependent radiative forcing F (t) is only applied to
the uppermost box, such that F1 = F(t) and Fk = 0 for k =
2, ..., N. The stochastic forcing (cid:15)(t) is likewise implemented
with non-zero entry ε1(t) = σW ξ (t). We motivate the white
noise process ξ (t) with standard deviation (SD) σW by the
found impact of weather ﬂuctuations10,15,77.

Integrating equation (3) yields the solution of the surface
temperature T1(t), given by a sum of the forced response

T1,F (t) and internal variations T1,I(t):

is uniquely deﬁned29,30 by the feedback parameters λk and
weights wk (k = 1, ..., N) with ∑N
k=1 wk = 1, which depend on
the entries of C and K (Appendix A). The internal ﬂuctua-
tions T1,I(t) in formula (4) represent an Itô-integral over the
Wiener process W (s). Therefore, T1,I(t) can be written as a
weighted sum of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, where
the k-th OU process solves the stochastic differential equation
dU(t) = −λkU(t)dt + σW
dW (t) and receives weight wk. Ac-

covariance matrix is determined by σW , C1, wk, and λk (Ap-
pendix B).

B. Bayesian inference algorithm

1.

Joint emulation of forced and internal variations

To separate the internal and forced contributions to the
GMST variance, we introduce the Bayesian inference algo-
rithm implemented in “ClimBayes”. We ﬁt the linear stochas-
tic two-box EBM to GMST data (Table I), as illustrated in Fig-
ure 1. The Bayesian inference algorithm relies on annually-
resolved temperature and forcing time series as input data.
Moreover, it requires physics-informed prior information on
θ = (λ1, λ2, w1, T0, F0). The parameters λ1, λ2, and w1 corre-
spond to free parameters of the response function. T0 and F0
are initial free parameters.

We infer the posterior distributions of the uncertain param-
eters θ conditioned on target data y via Bayes theorem (2),
using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. To
this end, we assume that the target data can be described by
a deterministic model ΦF and stochastic measurement or in-
strinsic noise Z that is also allowed to depend on θ :

y = ΦF (θ ) + Z(θ )

(6)

Formula (6) yields the likelihood p(y|θ ). Combined with
prior information p(θ ), Bayes theorem (2) deﬁnes the poste-
rior distribution p(θ |y). In our case, the deterministic model
ΦF (θ ) is given by a discretization of the temperature re-
sponses T1,F (t). The noise term Z(θ ) corresponds to the in-
ternal ﬂuctuations T1,I(t).

This approach provides a joint estimate of the internal
and externally-forced response, based on the same physics-
informed response function and feedback parameters. The
best estimates of θ and the forced response T1,F (t) are deﬁned
as their posterior means E[θ |y)] and E[ΦF (θ )|y]. The SD σI
of the internal variability Z(θ ) determines σW (Appendix B)

4

Held et al. 28 and Geoffroy et al. 29 . Our experiments use inde-
pendent prior distributions. We choose beta distributions with
shape parameters α = β = 2 for the marginal priors of λ1, λ2
as well as the initial parameters T0 and F0. This allows for a
physics-informed, ﬁxed parameter range, where the mean is
preferred over boundary values. The algorithm’s convergence
is improved compared to uniform priors. The intervals for the
feedback parameters λ1 : (0.2, 2) yr−1 and λ2 : (0.02, 0.2) yr−1
are similar to those from Fredriksen and Rypdal 30. Initial val-
ues T0 : (−0.5, 0.5) K and F0 : (−2.0, 2.0) Wm−2 are centered
around zero. The weight w1 : (0, 1) has an uniform prior. The
effective heat capacity of the upper box is ﬁxed to C1 = 10.1
W yr m−2 K−1, corresponding to a water column of 80 meters
depth. We consider no measurement noise, which is inher-
ently fulﬁlled for simulated GMST. For observed GMST, we
assume measurement errors to be small compared to internal
ﬂuctuations47. We veriﬁed that our ﬁndings are robust against
reasonable variations of the MCMC and prior speciﬁcations.
To obtain the best parameter estimates, “ClimBayes” uses
a Metropolis Hastings (MH) algorithm from the family of
MCMC methods. To this end, we discretize the forward op-
erator and compute annual temperature anomalies relative to
the starting point t = 0 by a midpoint rule25:

k=1

∑
j=1

e−(m− j+1/2)λk (F(t j) + F0) (7)

The time step t j corresponds to the j-th year. Discretizing
T1,I leads to a normally-distributed weighted sum of AR(1)-
processes with covariance matrix entries depending on λk and
wk (Appendix B). The likelihood p(y|θ ) is given by the nor-
mal distribution of T1,F (t) + T1,I(t). This requires the calcula-
tion of the covariance matrix for each sample in the Markov
chain. For numerical robustness and computational efﬁciency,
however, we approximate the likelihood function using an it-
erative scheme (Appendix B).

The MCMC algorithm uses four chains with 20,000 sam-
ples each, from which the ﬁrst 5,000 are discarded as burn-in.
The proposal distribution is initially set to a normal distribu-
tion with mean zero and variances (0.2, 2, 1, 1, 2) · 10−5 for
θ = (λ1, λ2, w1, T0, F0). After 2,500 samples, the proposals are
distributed according to the weighted sum of the initial nor-
mal proposal distribution and the empirical covariance matrix
of previous samples.

We check the convergence of the Markov chains follow-
ing two performance measures: First,
the Gelman-Rubin
diagnostics78,79, which compares the inter-chain and between-
chain variances. The diagnostics is ≤ 1.1 for all but two EMIC
models, complying to recommendations80,81. UMD shows
slightly worse sampling behavior due to a weakly constraint
slow feedback, as does DCESS ESM v1 because of very small
residuals. In both cases, however, adding more samples does
not change the results. Second, we use the Monte Carlo stan-
dard error82, which constructs an asymptotic conﬁdence inter-
val for the posterior mean. In our experiments, the half-width
of this interval is smaller than 5 % of the prior mean, further
assuring convergence82,83.

late forced and internal GMST ﬂuctuations. a The workﬂow builds

ing that the target GMST can be described a deterministic model

distributions p(θ |y) of uncertain parameters conditioned on temper-
ature data y and a physically-motivated emulation of the forced and

and is approximated by the residuals’ SD, that is, the differ-
ence between the target data and the forced response. Samples
of the internal variations T1,I(t) can be drawn from its covari-
ance matrix, using the best estimates of θ (Appendix B). The
forced + internal variations T1,F (t) + T1,I(t) represent the full
response of the stochastic two-box EBM and, thus, provides a
model for the target variability. To streamline our discussion,
we will refer to the modeled forced and forced + internal re-
sponse as emulation.

2. Numerical implementation

The “ClimBayes” package provides the numerical imple-
mentation of our approach (Fig. 1) and allows for straight-
forward adjustments via a conﬁguration ﬁle. Most impor-
tantly, this includes speciﬁcations of the number of boxes,
prior distributions, MCMC sampling properties, and ﬁxed pa-
rameters. We choose N = 2 boxes (Appendix C) in line with

C. Spectral analysis and variance ratios

Given a temperature time series T (t), the power spectral
density (PSD) at frequency f corresponds to the Fourier trans-
form of the autocovariance

S( f ) =

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

e−2πi f k E [(T (t) − µ) (T (t + k) − µ)] dk ,

(8)

with lag k = t2 − t1 and mean µ := E[T (t)]. This assumes
X(t) to be weakly stationary, which is reasonably fulﬁlled af-
ter linear detrending the GMST data. Following Ellerhoff and
Rehfeld 3, we use the multitaper method with three windows
to compute the PSD and χ 2−distributed uncertainties. Mean
spectra are obtained after interpolation to the lowest resolution
and binning into equally spaced log-frequency intervals84.
The spectra are visualized over periods τ = 1/ f and logarith-
mically smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 0.04 decibels.

We compare the PSD for three types of time series: (1)
the target temperature data from historical observations or cli-
mate model simulations, AR5 EMIC and CMIP5 models, (2)
the emulated forced variations T1,F (t), and (3) the emulated
forced + internal temperature variations T1,F (t) + T1,I(t) from
the stochastic two-box EBM. To compute the forced + inter-
nal PSD, we ﬁrst sample 1000 realizations of the internal re-
sponse T1,I(t). We add these to T1,F (t) and compute the PSD
for all samples. Mean spectra and 95% conﬁdence bands are
obtained from this ensemble.

Variance ratios are calculated by dividing the emulated by
the target variance. Following Parseval’s theorem, we deter-
mine the timescale-dependent variance by integrating the PSD
over frequencies. We consider frequency bands correspond-
ing to interannual (2-5 yrs), decadal (5-20 yrs), multidecadal
(20-50 yrs) and centennial (50-200 yrs) scales.

IV. RESULTS

A. Example application to historical observations

We demonstrate the application of the Bayesian inference
algorithm and our spectral analysis on the example of GMST
observations from HadCRUT547. Figure 2a shows the forcing
and temperature time series together with the best estimate
of the forced response T1,F (t). The forced response follows
the global warming trend and shows cooling periods after vol-
canic eruptions. Credible intervals (CIs) capture the uncer-
tainties of the forced response, but not those due to internal
variability. As a result, observations partly lie outside CIs.
Uncertainties of the two-box forced response are largest at the
time series’ start.

Figure 2b shows marginal prior and posterior distribu-
tions for the free parameters of the stochastic two-box
EBM. The feedbacks λ1 = 1.16 (0.59, 1.78) yr−1 and λ2 =
0.09 (0.03, 0.16) yr−1 (Tab. III) correspond to timescales of
approximately ten months and ten years. The initial values
T0 and F0 are well constrained and close to zero. The weight
w1 = 0.64 (0.37, 0.86) tends to emphasize the fast feedback.

5

The power spectral density (Fig. 2c) of the forced response
alone is smaller than that of the target temperature. Con-
versely, the magnitude of the emulated forced + internal PSD
agrees with the target PSD within uncertainties, except for
the interannual scale. While the emulated PSD constanly in-
creases from interannual to multidecadal scales, HadCRUT5
shows a modulation with increased power on periods of two
to ten years, which is not captured by the emulated response.
Figure 2d compares the variance on interannual to multi-
decadal timescales. The variance ratios are formed by di-
viding the emulated forced or forced + internal variance
by the variance obtained from the HadCRUT5 target. The
forced variance is smaller than the target variance on all
timescales. Incorporating internal variability reduces this mis-
match strongly, yet, is not enough to capture all ﬂuctuations
on interannual scales. On decadal and multidecadal scales,
the emulated forced + internal variability agrees well with the
observations.

B. Parameters estimated from last millennium simulations

We use Bayesian inference to ﬁt the stochastic two-box
EBM to GMST simulations from CMIP5 models and AR5
EMICs (section II). Table II shows the best estimates, that is
the posterior means, and 95% CIs of θ = (λ1, λ2, w1, T0, F0)
as well as the SD σI of the internal variability T1,I(t). Across
all simulations, the short-term feedback λ1 varies between
1.92 and 0.23 yr−1, spanning the full prior range between
six months and ﬁve years. The long-term feedback λ2 varies
between 0.19 and 0.01 yr−1, corresponding to characteristic
timescales of approximately ﬁve to one hundred years.

Differences between AR5 EMICs and CMIP5 models are
most pronounced for λ1. CMIP5 simulations exhibit larger
CIs and inter-model differences, while most EMICs show sim-
ilar λ1. The weight w1 > 0.5 is larger than w2 = 1 − w1, em-
phasizing the relative importance of the fast compared to the
slow feedback. w1 is closer to unity for AR5 EMICs than
for CMIP5 models. CLIMBER2 (mean) shows exceptionally
large λ1 and small w1. The initial temperature T0 is well con-
strained and close to zero. Inter-model differences are greatest
in F0 and linked to varying temperature amplitudes at the be-
ginning of the time series with respect to the mean (Fig. 7).
The SD σI of the internal variability from CMIP5 models lies
between 0.09 and 0.15 K and is larger than for AR5 EMICs
(0.02 to 0.09 K).

C. Emulation of power spectral density

Figure 3 compares the target PSD to the emulated forced
and forced + internal PSD. For most simulations, the emu-
lated forced + internal PSD agrees with the target within un-

forced and forced + internal PSD above decadal scales, except
for the LOVECLIM ensemble members. Hence, the forced

variability in the emulation compensates for the mismatch be-
tween the forced and target PSD, yet is not enough to capture
all variations (Fig. 3a,c,e, and i). Differences between em-
ulated and target PSD are most pronounced for CLIMBER2
(mean), showing an overestimation on multidecadal to cen-
tennial scales by the emulation.

For CMIP5 simulations, the emulated forced PSD under-
estimates the target PSD on all timescales. Conversely, the
forced + internal variability matches the target well for al-
most all models. Minor differences are found on interannual
scales (Fig. 3l, s, and u). Here, the target PSD of MPI-ESM-P
and HadCM3 exhibit increased power on periods of two to ten
years. The emulated forced + internal PSD for BCC-CSM1-1
deviates from that of the target, by showing increased power
on interannual and decreased power on multidecadal to cen-
tennial scales.

D. Separating internal and externally-forced variance

Figure 4 shows the mean and spread of variance ratios
on interannual to centennial scales for the considered model
types. Variance ratios smaller than one indicate less em-
ulated forced or forced+internal than target variance. We
add a comparison of the variance from the ﬁve LOVECLIM
V.1.2 ensemble members (E1-E5) (Fig. 4b) to that of the re-
maining AR5 EMICs (Fig. 4a) and CMIP5 models (Fig. 4c).
Here, AR5 EMICs explicitly include the LOVECLIM ensem-
ble mean, but not its members. For all model types, the rela-
tive contribution of internal variability decreases with increas-
ing timescale, as the ratios for forced and forced + internal
variance become more similar. The contribution of internal
variability is larger in LOVECLIM ensemble members and
CMIP5 simulations compared to AR5 EMICs.

The emulated variance of AR5 EMICs (Figure 4a) is domi-
nated by forced variations and matches the target variance on

multidecadal and centennial scales. Outliers on these scales
correspond to CLIMBER2 (mean), in line with the overes-
timated PSD in Figure 3b. On shorter timescales, the emu-
lated variance tends to underestimate the target variance. The
mismatch is largest on the interannual scale. Members of the
LOVECLIM V.1.2. ensemble (Fig. 4b) exhibit more internal
contributions to the variance on all timescales compared to
AR5 EMICs. The ensemble’s emulated forced + internal vari-
ance approximates the target well on the decadal scale. On
smaller (larger) timescales, we ﬁnd an underestimation (over-
estimation) of the target variance.

The mean emulated forced + internal variance of CMIP5
simulations (Fig. 4c) is close to one on all timescales and
agrees better with the target than that of AR5 EMICs and
LOVECLIM V.1.2. ensemble members. The relative con-
tribution of internal compared to forced variations is similar
to that of LOVECLIM ensemble members. However, there
is a larger spread of variance ratios. Moreover, we ﬁnd a
small tendency of the emulation to underestimate the decadal
while overestimating the centennial variance of CMIP5 mod-
els. BCC-CSM1-1 represents an outlier, with the uppermost
variance ratio on the shorter and lowermost on the longer
timescales, in line with the spectral analysis (Fig. 3l).

V. DISCUSSION

We demonstrate the emulation of GMST variability as
simulated by state-of-the-art climate models using a linear
stochastic two-box EBM and Bayesian inference. Our analy-
sis builds on the same, physically-motivated response function
for internal and external processes, and allows for a consistent
separation of internal and externally-forced variability. Esti-
mates of the timescale-dependent variance show that the rel-
ative contribution of internal variability increases with model
complexity and decreases with timescale.
Building on previous studies25,31,

the strength of our
Bayesian framework is that it yields the posterior means and

CIs for the uncertain parameters of the stochastic two-box
EBM ﬁtted to GMST simulations. Our ﬁndings reveal a de-
pendence of the estimated feedback parameters on the re-
sponse to intermittent volcanic eruptions. This is reﬂected
in consistently high values for w1, emphasizing the fast feed-
back. Moreover, the inter-model spread of λ1 in CMIP5 sim-
ulations suggests a link to the implemented volcanic forcing:
CMIP5 simulations driven by a comparatively weak recon-
struction (“GRA”) tend to show higher values for λ1 com-
pared to those driven by “CEA” (Tab. I), which has greater
forcing amplitudes. λ1 and w1 are particularly high for BCC-
CSM1-1, indicating a fast but weak forced response of the
ﬁtted EBM (Fig. 7). This is consistent with a weak forced
response in BCC-CSM1-185. In CLIMBER2 (mean), λ1 and
w1 are poorly constrained, as CIs span the full prior range.
We ﬁnd that the temperature response to volcanic eruptions
in CLIMBER2 (mean) is delayed compared to all other AR5
EMIC simulations. The estimated λ1 and w1 can be reconciled
with these if the temperature data was shifted by one year. Al-
together, the sensitivity of the ﬁt to intermittent volcanic forc-
ing suggests that high-frequency forcing plays a crucial role
for simulating temperature variability across scales correctly.

Different methods have been developed to isolate forced
and internal variations based on detrending86, single-model
ensembles5,87–89, and deterministic EBMs90,91, among others.
The application of a Bayesian energy balance framework to
the timescale-dependent quantiﬁcation of forced and internal
variance is novel. Our method provides a robust and joint
separation of the variations at every step in time in a statisti-
cally sound way. We ﬁnd a wide agreement of the emulated
forced + internal variance with that from CMIP5 simulations.
The fact that the stochastic two-box EBM mimics the tem-
perature variations well is in line with previous ﬁnding on a
linear relation between external forcing and GMST3,29,30,92.
Small differences for HadCM3 and MPI-ESM (Fig. 3s and u)
are similar to those in HadCRUT5 and could be due to the
spectral imprint of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation3,93. Our
EBM cannot represent this oscillatory climate mode, which

could result in the observed underestimation of the PSD by
the emulation.

The SD and covariance structure of the EBM’s internal vari-
ations is given by the residuals of the forced response and es-
timated feedback parameters, respectively. Thus, mismatches
on interannual variance can propagate to longer timescales.
The tendency to overestimate long-term variability in the
emulation of AR5-EMICs and LOVECLIM V.1.2 ensemble
members (Fig. 4b and c) could therefore be due to differ-
ent correlation properties of the internal variability in the
target and the stochastic two-box EBM. A similar, but re-
versed, effect is found for the CMIP5 simulation BCC-CSM1-
1 (Fig. 3l). The simulation’s weak response to volcanic
eruptions85 leads to an emphasis of the fast feedback (Tab. II)
and depletion of correlation in the EBM’s internal response.
As a result, the emulated forced + internal variance overes-
timates (underestimates) the target variance on short (long)
timescales. Hence, explaining spectral properties of tempera-
ture time series not only requires consideration of stochastic
noise94, but also precise knowledge of its correlation structure
and the forced response. This highlights a need for simple,
stochastic dynamical models95 to simulate temperature ﬂuc-
tuations on long timescales.

The components of AR5 EMICs show a reduced number of
scales compared to the AOGCMs, which simpliﬁes the com-
plexity of the processes contributing to variability. There-
fore, the relatively strong forced variability in EMICs is not
a main deﬁciency, but serves to explore the long-term cou-
pling between different Earth system components in response
to radiative forcing. Compared to other AR5 EMICs, LOVE-
CLIM V.1.2 features a more complex, three-layered atmo-
sphere, which likely explains increased variability in the en-
semble members. Differences between variance ratios based
on the emulated forced and forced + internal variability from
the LOVECLIM ensemble members (Fig. 4b) are similar to
CMIP5 simulations (Fig. 4c). This indicates that EMICs
with a more realistic representation of atmospheric variabil-
ity might better capture the relative contribution of forced and
internal temperature variations across timescales.

One limitation of our study arises from the fact that the
developed framework requires annually-resolved forcing and
GMST as input data. Investigating the immediate effects of
radiative forcing therefore necessitates an extension to sub-
annual resolution. Moreover, the forced response is likely sen-
sitive to uncertainties in the forcing. Applying the workﬂow to
paleoclimate reconstructions could therefore be challenging.
On the one hand, “ClimBayes” does not yet run at the best
possible speed, as there are faster Bayesian algorithms25. On
the other hand, “ClimBayes” represents an accessible, trans-
parent, and well-documented numerical framework that can
be easily adapted and extended, for example by integrating
“Rstan”96 or multilevel delayed acceptance MCMC97. Sim-
ilar to Fredriksen and Rypdal 30 , we use a response function
of exponential form, solving the ordinary differential equa-
tion (1). Future research could test the potential of Bayesian
methods to ﬁnd response functions describing the effects of
climate forcing on different observables98,99. Furthermore,
the presented framework can be applied to single forcing

9

experiments70 for quantifying the contribution of single forc-
ings to the spectrum. This will help better understand the cli-
mate system’s response and interplay of intrinsic and external
components in driving climate variability.

VI. CONCLUSION

We presented a physically-motivated emulation of GMST
data using Bayesian inference and a stochastic energy balance
model. Analyzing AR5 EMICs and CMIP5 simulations for
the last millennium, we found that the power spectral density
of the combined forced + internal response approximates the
target spectrum well. We show that our emulation can be used
to separate internal and forced contributions to GMST vari-
ability across timescales. The relative contribution of inter-
nal dynamics increases with model complexity and decreases
with timescale. While AR5 EMICs predominately exhibit
forced variations, simulations from CMIP5 models and the
LOVECLIM ensemble members exhibit major contributions
from the forced and internal response. This suggests that
EMICs with more realistic atmospheric variability can simu-
late statistical properties of climate ﬂuctuations more reliably
and could therefore help assess future variability and poten-
tially associated risks using long-term projections. Our de-
veloped framework is robust, readily available and can thus
be widely applied to describe, emulate and diagnose observed
and simulated temperature variability.

For given λk and wk, the SD of the stochastic forcing, σW ,

residuals, that is the data minus the estimated forced response.

Iterative computation of the likelihood

Theoretically, the likelihood is given by a normal distribu-
tion with mean T1,F and covariance matrix Cov(Z), depending
on θ . However, computing the covariance matrix dynami-
cally for each sample in the Markov chain can lead to difﬁcul-
ties: In particular, Cov(Z) needs to be inverted for every sam-
ple, which is computationally expensive. Moreover, the de-
terminant det(Cov(Z)) can be close to zero, which can make
numerical calculations unstable. Potential biases include de-
creasing goodness of ﬁt and accuracy of estimated posteriors.
To solve this problem, we propose an iterative approach.
This keeps λk and wk in the covariance matrix ﬁxed for each
iteration of the algorithm. The ﬁrst iteration uses the prior
means for λk and wk as well as a starting value for σW . The
latter corresponds to σI = 0.1K for CMIP5 simulations and
LOVECLIM ensemble members, and σI = 0.05 K for AR5
EMICs. For the second iteration, the estimated posterior
means of λk and wk deﬁne the covariance matrix entries. Ad-
ditionally, σI is set to the SD of the residuals, which deﬁnes

freedom. This is reﬂected in increasing CIs for the forced re-
sponse and parameters (Tab. III) with more boxes. That is
why N = 2 represents the best compromise between goodness
of ﬁt, identiﬁability of parameters, and number of free param-
eters in our experiments.

Appendix D: Emulated forced temperature response for
considered simulations

Figure 7 shows the best estimate of the EBM’s forced re-
sponse, ﬁtted to the target simulations from all considered
models. CIs are much narrower and almost vanishing com-
pared to HadCRUT (Fig. 2a). This is due to the fact that with
increasing length of the time series the posterior uncertainties
of the parameters and the forced response decrease.

σW . The result of this second iteration are the posterior dis-
tributions for λ1, .., λN, weights w2, ..., wN, initial forcing F0,
and initial temperature T0. These iterations can be repeated
and adjusted with “ClimBayes”. We ﬁnd that two iterations
are enough to ﬁt the forced + internal response to the consid-
ered data well, and that further iterations do not improve the
goodness of ﬁt.

3. Sampling from internal variability

Sampling internal variations T1,I(t) requires the values of
λk, wk, and σW in Cov(Z) (equation B1). λk and wk are set
to the posterior means. We calculate σW from σI, which we
assume to equal the SD of the residuals. As an example, Fig-
ure 5 shows realizations of T1,I(t) drawn from the estimated
covariance of HadCRUT5 observations.

forced response of the stochastic two-box EBM and three example
realizations of the emulated forced + internal variability.

Appendix C: Comparison of one-, two- and three-box EBM

We have veriﬁed that our results are robust against rea-
sonable variations of the number of boxes. Here, we ex-
amine the difference between N ∈ (1, 2, 3) boxes on the ex-
ample of the HadCRUT5 GMST (Fig. 6). We choose feed-
back priors to cover the same overall range as for the two-
box model (N = 1: λ1 ∈ (1/200, 2) yr−1, and N = 3: λ1 ∈
(1/5, 2)yr−1, λ2 ∈ (1/50, 1/5)yr−1, λ3 ∈ (1/200, 1/50)yr−1).
The stochastic two-box EBM ﬁts the data more accurately
(root mean square error: RMSE = 0.115 K) than the one-box
EBM (RMSE = 0.130 K) (Appendix Fig. 6). The three-box
EBM yields only minor improvements (RMSE = 0.0111 K).
This pattern is consistent for AR5 EMICs and CMIP5 simu-
lations, and reﬂected in similar forced responses and power
spectral densities for N ∈ (1, 2, 3). Adding boxes, however,
increases the risk of overﬁtting due to increasing degrees of
