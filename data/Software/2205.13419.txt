Abstract. Current citation practices observed in articles are very noisy, confus-
ing,  and  not  standardised,  making  identifying  the  cited  works  problematic  for 
humans and any reference extraction software. In this work, we want to investi-
gate such citation practices for referencing different types of entities and, in par-
ticular,  to  understand  the  most  used  metadata  in  bibliographic  references.  We 
identified 36 types of cited entities (the most cited ones were articles, books, and 
proceeding papers) within the 34,140 bibliographic references extracted from a 
vast set of journal articles on 27 different subject areas. The analysis of such bib-
liographic references, grouped by the particular type of cited entities, enabled us 
to highlight the most used metadata for defining bibliographic references across 
the subject areas. However, we also noticed that, in some cases, bibliographic 
references did not provide the essential elements to identify the work they refer 
to easily. 

Keywords: bibliographic references, citations, publication metadata, publica-
tion types, citation behaviours.

Introduction 

Citations  are  fundamental  tools  to  track  how  science  evolves  over  time  [1].  Indeed, 
citation networks are the instruments that link scientific thinking, forming a complex 
chain of documents related to each other that enables the highlighting of research trends 
within  the  various  scholarly  disciplines.  The  creation  of  such  a  network  is  possible 
thanks to the effort that authors and publishers invest in preparing particular elements 
of their articles: the bibliographic references. Bibliographic references are the means 

2 

for creating conceptual citation links between a citing and cited entities and carry an 
important function: providing enough metadata to facilitate an agent (whether a human 
or  a  machine)  to  identify  the  cited  works.  Thus,  providing  precise  bibliographic 
metadata of cited works is crucial for enabling citation networks to satisfactorily and 
efficiently contribute to the intellectual exchange among researchers. 

Despite the massive number of citation style manuals released in the past years that 
have  had  the  goal  of  providing  standardised  approaches  to  the  definition  of  biblio-
graphic references (and, in particular, their metadata), some prior studies, such as [12] 
and [7], have shown how the current citation practices are very noisy, confusing, and 
not standardised at all. For instance, several disciplinary journals often avoid adopting 
standardised citation style manuals and define their own (yet another) citation style [3]. 
This considerable heterogeneity in the adoption of citation guidelines, combined with 
the variability of the types of cited works (and, thus, of related metadata) that may in-
clude articles, datasets, software, images, green literature, etc., makes the identification 
of the cited works problematic for humans and also (and in particular) for any reference 
extraction software used for building bibliographic metadata repositories and citation 
indexes. 

In this work, following prior studies we run on similar topics [7-8], we want to in-
vestigate existing citation practices by analysing a huge set of articles to measure which 
metadata are used across the various scholarly disciplines, independently from the par-
ticular citation style adopted, for defining bibliographic references. In particular, we 
want to answer the following research questions (RQ1-RQ3): 

1.  Which entities are cited by articles published in journals of different disci-

plines? 

2.  What is the standard metadata set used across such disciplines for describing 

3. 

cited works within bibliographic references? 
Is there any mechanism in place (i.e. hypertextual links) to facilitate the algo-
rithmic recognition of where a bibliographic reference is cited in the text? 

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we introduce some related 
works concerning our research. In Section 3, we present the material and methods we 
have used for performing our analysis. Section 4 introduces the results of our analysis, 
which are discussed in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude the paper by sketch-
ing out some future works.

Related works 

In the past, several works addressed studies and analyses of bibliographic references 
from different perspectives. One of the essential works in the area is authored by Sweet-
land [12]. In his work, he highlighted the functions conveyed by bibliographic refer-
ences and citation style manuals and the errors in the reference lists and in-text citations 
that represent a crucial issue for accomplishing such functions. In particular, he identi-
fied the use of a great variety of formats for referencing cited articles that increased the 
chances of misunderstanding referencing guidelines proposed by the journals, which, 

3 

consequently, contributes to the high errors in bibliographic metadata description. A 
recent study we performed [7], run against a larger corpus of journal articles and bibli-
ographic references and used as starting point of the work presented in this paper, con-
firmed that many of the concerns highlighted by Sweetland are in place still today, thus 
showing that the situation has not changed in the past 32 years. 

Some mistakes identified in bibliographic references may be conveyed by limited 
clarity in describing particular publication types cited in articles. Indeed, depending on 
the type of the cited works, metadata of bibliographic references may change a lot: from 
author(s), year of publication, article title, journal name, volume, issue, page numbers, 
typical of journal articles, to author(s), year of publication, article title, complete title 
proper of proceedings volume in which it occurs, statements of responsibility for the 
proceedings, series statement, place, publisher and page numbers, typical of confer-
ences [11]. However, sometimes, journal citation styles fail to address all the possible 
publication types cited by the authors of a citing article [7]. 

One study introduced by Heneberg [2], among the most relevant ones focussing on 
the analysis of specific disciplines, analysed the percentage of uncited publications that 
were not journal original research articles or reviews authored by scientists in Mathe-
matics, Physiology and Medicine who either received Fields medals or were Nobel lau-
reates. He discovered that the most significant part of these uncited publications listed 
in Web of Science (WoS) was mainly editorial material, progress reports (e.g. abstracts 
presented at conferences), and discussion-related publications (e.g. letters to the editor). 
Only a small number of research articles and reviews in journals were left uncited, thus 
highlighting how the types of the publications seemed to be a relevant characteristic 
which explained, at least to a certain extent, why part of the works of even influential 
authors are not cited at all. 

 In another work, Kratochvíl et al. [3] analysed the declared referencing practices of 
1,100 journals in the biomedical domain. They discovered that, even if there exist still 
today several citation guidelines for biomedical research, a considerable number of bi-
omedical  journals  preferred  to  adopt  their  own  style  and  that  the  most  essential 
metadata used when referencing cited works were author(s), cited work title, and year 
of publication. However, helpful metadata (e.g. DOI), recognised from the answers to 
more than 100 surveys the authors performed, were not included in several of the cita-
tion styles adopted by the journals in the corpus analysed.  

Other studies have concerned the analysis of citations to specific kinds of publica-
tions, e.g. data (in a broader sense, i.e. including datasets and software). For instance, 
Park et al. [5] analysed hundreds of biomedical journals to measure the number of for-
mal citations to data (i.e. specified by including a bibliographic reference describing 
them) against the informal citations (i.e. mentions contained within the text of an article, 
e.g. by simply adding their URL). They highlighted how informal citations to data were 
the most adopted approach due mainly to the absence of explicit requirements by the 
publisher to correctly add them as bibliographic references (showing an inadequate ci-
tation type coverage in the citation styles adopted) and, in part, to the limited familiarity 
of the authors when dealing with formal citations to data. Indeed, several studies, such 
as [4], stressed that mastering citation styles is a complex activity and that there is a 
need to reflect on (and even redesign) citation styles to address current citation habits.

3  Materials and methods 

The articles from which we have extracted the bibliographic references to analyse for 
this study were obtained from a selection of the journals included in the SCImago Jour-
nal & Country Rank (https://www.scimagojr.com/). Following a methodology we de-
fined, which is introduced with more details in [10] and that has been already success-
fully adopted in previous studies [7-8], we first selected the most cited journals in each 
of the 27 subject areas listed in SCImago in the 2015-2017 triennium according to the 
SCImago total cites ranking. We grouped these subject areas in five macro categories: 
Health Sciences [H] (including the subject areas Medicine [S1], Nursing [S2], Veteri-
nary [S3], Dentistry [S4], Health Professions [S5]), Social Sciences and Humanities 
[S] (including Arts and Humanities [S6], Business, Management and Accounting [S7], 
Decision Sciences [S8], Economics, Econometrics and Finance [S9], Psychology [S10] 
and Social Sciences [S11]), Life Sciences [L] (including Agricultural and Biological 
Sciences [S12], Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology [S13], Immunology and 
Microbiology [S14], Neuroscience [S15], Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceu-
tics [S16]), Physical Sciences [P] (including Chemical Engineering [S17], Chemistry 
[S18],  Computer  Science  [S19],  Earth  and  Planetary  Sciences  [S20],  Energy  [S21], 
Engineering [S22], Environmental Science [S23], Materials Science [S24], Mathemat-
ics [S25], and Physics and Astronomy [S26]), and Multidisciplinary [M] (including the 
subject area Multidisciplinary [S27] mainly involving big magazine and journals). The 
sample we obtained was the proportional representation of each subject area at SCI-
mago Ranking in terms of dimension. We included only one journal from each pub-
lisher under the same subject area to avoid having, under the same subject area, journals 
sharing similar editorial policies. 

Each journal in the sample was represented by five articles (in PDF format) pub-
lished in the most recent issue (excluding special issues that sometimes adopt diversi-
fied journal policies for referencing) published between October 1st and October 31st, 
2019.  For  journals  not  releasing  any  issue  in  this  period,  the  sample  considered  the 
immediately previous issue published before October 1st. For issues containing more 
than  five  articles,  the  selection  adopted  a  probabilistic  systematic  random  sampling 
technique based on the average number of articles published by the journal in the period 
mentioned above. As for the journals containing less than five articles, the sample con-
sidered all those attending the selection criteria described in detail in [10]. 

Starting from such sample, we considered the total of 34,140 bibliographic refer-
ences composing the bibliographic references lists of the selected 729 articles (172 in 
Health  Sciences,  191  Social  Sciences  and  Humanities,  114  in  Life  Sciences,  232  in 
Physical Sciences, and 20 in Multidisciplinary) which were analysed to detect the types 
of the cited works in each discipline and the structure of bibliographic references for 
each type of cited work, considering different reference styles’ formatting guidelines. 
In particular, we identified the descriptive elements (introduced in Table 1) adopted for 
the bibliographic references for each type of cited work.

Such descriptive elements were classified according to the Resource Description & 
Access (RDA) core elements (https://www.librarianshipstudies.com/2016/03/rda-core-
elements.html). In addition, we also analysed all the in-text reference pointers – e.g. 
“(Doe et al., 2022)” and “[3]” – denoting all the bibliographic references in our sample 

 
6 

to see how many of them are accompanied by a link pointing to the related bibliographic 
reference they denote.

Results 

All the data gathered in our analysis are available in [9]. In the first stage of the analysis 
we considered all the 34,140 bibliographic references composing our sample, that we 
used to identify the following different kinds of publications (RQ1): articles [a], books 
and  related  chapters  [b],  manuscripts  [c],  technical  reports  and  related  chapters  [d], 
webpages  [e],  proceeding  papers  [f],  conference  papers  [g],  grey  literature  [h],  data 
sheets [i], forthcoming chapters [j], forthcoming articles [k], unpublished material [l], 
standards [m], working papers and preprints [n], e-books and related chapters [o], news-
papers  [p],  online  databases  [q],  web  videos  [r],  patents  [s],  software  [t],  manu-
als/guides/toolkits [u], personal communications [v], book series [w], other kinds of 
publications (including memorandum, governmental official publications, legislation, 
informative  materials,  audio  records,  motion  pictures,  speeches,  photographs,  slide 
presentation, podcasts, engravings, lithography and television shows) [y], and unrecog-
nised publications [z]. 

As summarised in Table 2, articles, books (and their chapters), and proceeding pa-
pers were the first, second and third most cited types of publications across all the sub-
ject areas. The same seven types of publications corresponded to at least 50% of the 
total bibliographic references in each subject area, namely articles (83.55%), books and 
their  chapters  (7.93%),  proceeding  papers  (2.53%),  webpages  (1.30%),  technical  re-
ports (1.17%), working papers and preprints (0.67%) and conference papers (0.51%). 
However, these types did not comprise some other publication kinds cited by specific 
disciplines. For instance, grey literature is the eighth most cited type of work across all 
subject areas (0.47% of total bibliographic references). Still, it is the third most cited 
type of publication in arts and humanities articles (S6) and the fourth most cited type 
in chemical engineering (S17), decision sciences (S8) and mathematics (S25) articles. 
Thus, considering only the most cited types of publications overall does not properly 
represent the actual citing habits across the subject areas since some subject areas (e.g. 
social sciences – S11) tend to cite a greater variety of types of publications while others 
(e.g. dentistry – S4) only a few types. In addition, as highlighted in Table 2, the types 
of publications supporting discussions across subject areas may vary. 

To understand the variability of the metadata for defining bibliographic references 
across the macro areas, we decided to select the seven most cited types of publications 
in each subject area to assure that the analysis coverage includes the most cited types 
of publications from the subject areas’ perspective. After this selection, all the types of 
publications in Table 1 were considered except manuscripts (c), forthcoming chapters 
(j), web videos (r), other kinds (y) and unidentified types of publications (z).

tions from the citing articles of S1-S27 to the a-z publication kinds, described as follows:

The 33,786 bibliographic references concerning such most significant types of pub-
lications  were  individually  analysed  to  identify  their  descriptive  elements  (i.e. 
metadata)  according  to  those  introduced  in  Table  1.  We  have  tracked  all  the  biblio-
graphic  elements  appearing  in  the  bibliographic  references  of  our  sample,  and  we 
marked all the elements specified in at least one bibliographic reference of at least 50% 
of the articles composing each subject category. Finally, we have computed the most 
used descriptive elements for each type of publication mentioned above by considering 
each macro area's most used descriptive elements. In practice, a descriptive element 
was selected if it was one of the most used in all the macro areas. The result of this 
analysis is summarised in Table 3 (RQ2).  

In the last part of our analysis, we identified if the in-text reference pointers – e.g. 
“(Doe et al., 2022)” or “[3]” – included in all the articles of our sample are hypertextu-
ally linked to the respective bibliographic references they denote (RQ3). The result of 
such analysis is shown in Fig. 1.

Discussion and lessons learnt 

The data in Table 2 suggest that articles are the most used channel to communicate 
scientific findings across all the subject areas. However, books were observed among 
the three most cited types of publications in all disciplines considered in our sample. In 
addition, we observed considerable variability in the types of publications cited by the 
articles  composing  our  sample  –  we  found  36  different  types  of  publications  within 
disciplines. Such variety suggests and reveals some citing habits across disciplines. For 
instance, we noticed a considerable portion of bibliographic references for which we 
could not identify which type of publication is referred to (columns “z” in Table 2), 
considering the data provided in the bibliographic references. This suggests that either 

 
10 

reference styles adopted by the journal were unclear or did not provide enough instruc-
tions on describing certain types of publications. We could also speculate that part of 
these issues derived from the lack of attention that authors and publishers sometimes 
put when writing/revising bibliographic references; however, this aspect should be in-
vestigated in more detail.  

Still looking at the results in Table 2, it seemed that some disciplines, e.g. the hu-
manities and social sciences, cited many publication types. This suggests that the dis-
cussions on such disciplines demand more comprehensive approaches. Second, refer-
ence styles adopted by such disciplines should provide more extensive guidelines for 
describing citing and referencing data, i.e. they should provide instructions on describ-
ing a greater variety of publications. The lack of specific guidelines for describing un-
common types of publications across disciplines, such as lithographs and engravings 
(which appeared in some social sciences articles), contributes to the number of uniden-
tifiable bibliographic references mentioned above. 

Despite the existence of thousands of reference styles and standards to guide the use 
and interpretation of bibliographic metadata uniformly, we observed (Table 3) that the 
representation of the information is approached differently across subject areas and, in 
general, macro areas: the same type of publication may have different descriptions in 
different disciplines. This may suggest a failure of reference styles’ purposes concern-
ing their role in standardising bibliographic references on a large scale.  

For instance, among their various purposes, bibliographic references act like sources 
of information and, from this perspective, the efforts to provide (at least) the necessary 
metadata for the proper identification of the referred publications are worthwhile and 
essential as a means for retrieving the cited works in external sources, such as biblio-
graphic catalogues and bibliographic databases. However, we noticed that such kinds 
of metadata were not always provided. Even if the title of the cited works (11 in Table 
3) is one of the most used metadata across all the macro areas, we observed that bibli-
ographic references in some articles did not always provide it. For instance, in 27% of 
articles from Physical Sciences, we noticed that bibliographic references pointing to 
web pages did not provide the title of the cited work. At the same time, they include a 
URL or a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI) to enable accessing the cited publication. In-
deed, in some cases, the article's title itself is not a mandatory element for allowing its 
retrieval (e.g. if a DOI is present). However, it is a crucial element to correctly identify 
the cited work, which is one of the primary purposes of bibliographic references. Sim-
ilarly,  considering  bibliographic  references  referring  to  articles,  we  observed  that 
metadata like the issue number (19 in Table 3) in which the cited article was published 
were omitted in most macro areas. 

Another point highlighted in Table 3 is that different publication types may have 
different characteristics. Indeed, the description of different types of publications may 
demand different types of metadata, which do not necessarily play the same role in the 
identification of the cited work and, because of that, may have different levels of im-
portance in terms of facilitating the task of identifying the cited work and such issues 
should be considered by metadata treatment tools, like the ontologies. 

We also noticed that part of the bibliographic references providing URLs to the cited 
works did not provide the date in which that content was consulted. This may represent 

11 

issues in later retrieving of such content because, unlike press sources of information 
that usually are modified after their release, online sources are susceptible to amend-
ments and might even become unavailable at any time without prior notification. 

In general, concerning the uniformity of the metadata provided by bibliographic ref-
erences referring to specific types of publications overall, we can notice that, in most 
cases, there is a relative (i.e. poor) uniformity. Indeed, the metadata referring to the 
same type of publications vary across disciplines.  

journals 

A careful analysis of the data in Table 3 showed other deficits in normalising bibli-
ographic references, even when they reference the same type of publication. For in-
stance, considering those referring to articles, we noticed that 71.59% provide the title 
of the journal which has published the cited article in the abridged format. This may be 
a  problem  for  identifying  the  full  title  of  a  journal  since,  even  if  there  exist  several 
sources  defining 
the  NLM  Catalog 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/journals/)  and  the  CAS  Source  Index 
(CASSI, https://cassi.cas.org), the big issue is that the abbreviation for a particular jour-
nal 
may be different considering different sources guidelines. This may have negative con-
sequences for the precise identification of the referred journal and, consequently, for its 
retrieval. Thus, to ensure the correct interpretation (also in the context of computational 
approaches), the journal title abbreviation should be accompanied by the indication of 
the source on which it was based.

By analysing the most used metadata (rows “A” in Table 3), we can observe that 
bibliographic references usually dismiss important elements that help readers identify 
the cited works. For instance, the DOI is not included in the most used metadata in the 
bibliographic references referring to articles, as the ISBN is not part of the most used 
metadata in the bibliographic references referring to books and book chapters.  

Overall, the most used metadata gathered are enough, in general, to identify the pub-
lications the bibliographic references refer to. We did notice some peculiar situations, 
however. The most used metadata for proceedings do not comprise the title of the pro-
ceedings in which the cited work was published nor the title of the conference in which 
the cited work was presented, even if these kinds of metadata were indeed used in the 
macro areas: Health Sciences and Multidisciplinary included the title of the conference 
(3), while Social Sciences, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences and, again, Multidiscipli-
nary included the title of the proceedings (8).  

For some publication types – i.e. software (t); manual, guides and toolkits (u), data 
sheets (i), standards (m) and personal communications (v) – we noted that bibliographic 
references do not provide any information concerning the nature of the document (i.e. 
the “general material designation in AACR2”, carrier type, point 46, in Table 1). The 
description of less-traditional types of publications – i.e. those except articles, books, 
and other similar textual publications – requires a clear indication of the type of publi-
cation being cited for allowing its immediate identification from the metadata provided 
in bibliographic references. For instance, grey literature usually provides a short note 
like “master thesis” or “doctoral thesis”, which  enables the reader to understand the 
format of the cited work immediately. 

12 

The links between in-text reference pointers and the bibliographic references they 
denote  (RQ3)  are  helpful  tools  to  formalise  the  connections  between  the  text  of  the 
citing article (i.e. the sentences including the in-text reference pointers, the related par-
agraphs  and  sections)  and  the  correspondent  cited  works  referenced  by  the  biblio-
graphic references. Around 49% of the articles in our sample provide such a feature 
(Fig. 1). Indeed, having such mechanisms in place simplifies, in principle, the develop-
ment of computational tools to track where cited works are referred to in the text of the 
citing  articles,  thus  facilitate  the  computational  recognition  of  citation  sentences  [6] 
and, by analysing these, of citation functions [13], i.e. the reason an author cites a cited 
work – because it reuses a method defined in the cited work, because it either agrees or 
disagrees with concepts and ideas introduced in the cited works, etc.  

However, 51% of the articles did not specify such links, which is a barrier to identi-
fying the position where a citation is defined in the text. Of course, one could use natural 
language processing tools and other techniques to retrieve the in-text reference pointers 
referring to bibliographic references in the text, but this is made complex by the heter-
ogeneity  of  the  formats  used  to  write  bibliographic  references  and  in-text  reference 
pointers, as highlighted in [7].  

Finally, it is worth mentioning that our analysis is not free from limitations. For in-
stance, we considered only one type of publication for the citing entities, i.e. journal 
articles. Indeed, since they represent the main types of publication cited across all the 
subject areas, at least according to our analysis, they should be a reasonable sample 
acting as a proxy of the entire population of the citing publications in all the subject 
areas considered. However, it would be possible that different publication types of cit-
ing articles may convey different citation behaviours. We leave this analysis to future 
studies.

Conclusions 

This work has focussed on presenting the results of an analysis of 34,140 bibliographic 
references in articles of different subject areas to understand the citing habits across 
disciplines and identify the most used metadata in bibliographic references depending 
on  the  particular  type  of  cited  entities.  In  our  analysis,  we  observed  that  the  biblio-
graphic references in our sample referenced 36 different types of cited works. Such a 
considerable variety of publications revealed the existence of particular citing behav-
iours in scientific articles that varied from subject area to subject area. In the future, 
further  investigation  should  be  performed  to  understand,  for  instance,  why  software 
was not listed among the most cited type of works in Computer Science while being 
one of the main topics discussed in several areas of Computer Science research.
