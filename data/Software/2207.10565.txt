Abstract 

Construction of future Muon Collider (or dedicated ¬µ-ring) tangential to nucleus colliders will 
give opportunity to realize ¬µA collisions at multi-TeV center of mass energies at a luminosity 
of order of 1029-1030 cm-2s-1. Obviously, such colliders will essentially enlighten fundamentals 
of strong interactions from quark to nucleus levels as well as clarify QCD basics. This paper is 
devoted to estimation of main parameters of the FCC, SppC, HL-LHC, HE-LHC and RHIC 
based muon-nucleus collider proposals by the software AloHEP. 

Keywords: Muon-nucleus collider, FCC, SppC, LHC, RHIC, Luminosity, Strong interactions, QCD basics 

1. Introduction 

Lepton-hadron  collisions  play  a  crucial  role 
in  our 
understanding  of  matter‚Äôs  structure  (see  [1]  and  references 
therein).  HERA,  the  first  and  still  unique  electron-proton 
collider, explored structure of protons at ‚àöùë†ùëíùëù ‚âà 0.3 ùëáùëíùëâ and 
provided  parton  distribution  functions  (PDFs)  for  adequate 
interpretation of the LHC and Tevatron data. TeV (or multi-
TeV)  scale  lepton-hadron  colliders  are  crucial  for  clarifying 
basics of QCD, which is responsible for 98% of mass of the 
visible  part  of  our  Universe.  It  should  be  emphasized  that 
future  lepton-hadron  colliders  will  give  opportunity  to  shed 
light  on  quark  ‚Üí  hadron  ‚Üí  nucleus  transitions  as  well. 
Besides, contruction of TeV energy lepton-hadron colliders is 
mandatory  to  provide  PDFs  for  adequate  interpretation  of 
forthcoming  data  from  HL/HE-LHC  [2,3]  and  FCC/SppC 
[4,5].  

Today,  linac-ring  type  ep  colliders  are  considered  as  sole 
realistic way to (multi-) TeV scale in lepton-hadron collisions 

(see  review  [6]  and  references  therein)  and  LHeC  [7]  is  the 
most promising candidate. However, situation may change in 
the  coming  years:  Œºp  and  ŒºA  colliders  can  come  forward 
depending on progress in muon beam production and cooling 
issues. We have reviewed muon-proton collider proposals in 
[1].  

This paper is devoted to estimation of main parameters of the 
FCC, SppC, HL-LHC, HE-LHC and RHIC based ŒºA collider 
proposals.  In  section  2,  we  present  different  muon-nucleus 
collider proposals in chronological order. Let us note that FCC 
based  ¬µ-Pb  colliders  are  considered  in  [8],  but  mistaken 
parameters  are  used  for  the  lead  beam;  SppC  based  ¬µ-Pb 
colliders are considered in [9] for a single energy choice for 
muon  beam;  the  RHIC  based  ¬µ-Au  colliders  have  been 
proposed in [10,11] without luminosity estimations; HL-LHC 
and HE-LHC based ¬µ-Pb colliders are considered in this paper 
for the first time. Main parameters of all these muon-nucleus 
colliders are computed by the software AloHEP [12‚Äì15] that 
is developed for quick estimation of luminosities, tune shifts 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and  disruption  for  different  types  of  colliders.  Finally,  in 
Section 3 we present our conclusions and recommendations.

In  this  section,  we  present  main  parameters  of  different 

muon-nucleus colliders.

FCC based energy-frontier lepton-hadron colliders have been 
proposed in [8], where main parameters of ep, ¬µp, e-Pb and ¬µ-
Pb  colliders  are  estimated.  As  mentioned  in  Introduction, 
mistaken  values  for  lead  beam  have  been  used.  Main 
parameters of the FCC based ¬µ-p colliders are cross-checked 
by using AloHEP in [1]. In this subsection, parameters of FCC 
based ¬µ-Pb colliders are computed by using AloHEP software 
(corrected  values  of  the  FCC  based  e-Pb  option  will  be 
presented in a separate paper). 
Main  parameters  of  muon  beam  are  summarized  in  Table 1 
[16]. These parameters will be used in subsections 2.2, 2.3 and 
2.4 as well. 

It is seen that beam-beam parameter for lead is very high. One 
way  to  reduce  it  to  acceptable  value  0.01  is  528/881  times 
decreasing of  number of muons per bunch which will cause 
corresponding reducing in luminosity. This reducing may be 
partially  compensated  by  increasing  the  number  of  Pb  per 
bunch. Increasing of this number by factor 200 results in value 
0.14/0.13 for muon beam tune shift which seems acceptable 
for  ¬µ-Pb  colliders.  In  summary,  these  modifications  lead  to 
approximately  2.5/4.4  times  reduction  of  luminosity  values 
(see Table 4).

SppC  based  Œº-Pb  collider  has  been  considered  for  a  single 
muon energy option (EŒº = 1.5 TeV) in [9]. Here we evaluate 
all three options given in Table 1. For lead beam parameters 
we use values presented in Table 5 (see Table A7.2 in [5]).

Implementation of these parameters into the software AloHEP 
leads  to  results  presented  in  Table  3  for  nominal/ERL60 
upgraded lead beam parameters. 

Implementing Tables 1 and 5 into the software AloHEP, we 
have  obtained  parameters  of  Œº-Pb  collisions  summarized  in 
Table 6. Let us mention that peak luminosity value for option 
II is 3 times less than the value given in  [9]. The reason for 
this is that collision frequency is taken equal to the revolution

frequency  of  muon  collider,  namely  66  kHz.  Instead,  the 
collision  frequency  value  of  21.6  kHz  has  to  be  taken  into 
account, assumming the muon beam repetition rate 12 Hz and 
approximately 1800 revolutions per pulse train. 

Implementing Tables 1 and 8 into the software AloHEP, we 
have  obtained  parameters  of  Œº-Pb  collisions  summarized  in 
Table 9.

It is seen that beam-beam parameter for lead is extremely high. 
It can be reduced to an acceptable value of 0.01 by decreasing 
number of muons 3600 times per bunch, which will result in a 
corresponding reduction in luminosity as a matter of course. 
This reduction may partially be compensated by increasing the 
number of Pb per bunch. Increase of this number by a factor 
of  16  results  in  tune  shift  value  of  0.1.  In  summary,  these 
modifications lead to 225 times reduction of luminosity values 
(see Table 7).

0.1 for muon beam tune shift. In summary, these modifications 
lead to approximately 3.3 times reduction of luminosity values 
(see Table 10).

is  acceptable  for  ¬µ-Pb  colliders.  In  summary, 
these

(see Table 13).

The  RHIC/EIC  based  muon-nucleus  collider  has  been 
proposed  in  [10]  assuming  reusage  of  the  electron  ring  for 
acceleration of muons up to 0.96 TeV. Later on, other muon 
energy  options  have  been  considered  in  [11].  In  References 
[10,11], parameters of ¬µp colliders are presented, whereas ¬µA 
parameters are not given. In this subsection, we evaluate main 
parameters  of  ¬µ-Au  collisions  for  E¬µ  =  0.96  TeV  option. 
Parameters of muon beam are presented in Table 14 (see Table 
2 of [10]).

can be reduced to an acceptable value of 0.01 by decreasing

corresponding reduction in luminosity as a matter of course. 
This reduction may partially be compensated by increasing the 
number of Au per bunch. Increase of this number by a factor 
of 14.6 results in tune shift value of 0.1 for muon beam which 
is  acceptable  for  ¬µ-Au  colliders.  In  summary, 
these 
modifications lead to 24 times reduction of luminosity values 
(see Table 17).

3. Conclusion 

Construction  of  future  muon  collider  (or  dedicated  ùúá-ring) 
tangential to existing and proposed hadron colliders will give 
opportunity to realize ùúáA colliders with multi-TeV center-of-
mass energies at a luminosity of order of 1029-1030 cm-2s-1 for 
FCC,  SppC,  HL-LHC,  HE-LHC  based  and  1027  cm-2s-1  for 
RHIC  based  muon-nucleus  colliders.  Obviously,  such 
colliders will essentially enlarge the physics search potential 
of corresponding nucleus colliders.

As seen in Section 2, needed number of muons per bunch for 
ùúáA colliders are 2-3 orders less than that of muon colliders. 
In this respect, construction of ùúáA colliders seems easier than 
MC itself. Therefore, the following strategy can be foreseen: 
construction  of  the  muon  ring  tangential  to  the  hadron 
colliders to investigate ùúáp and ùúáA collisions as a first step and 
then realization of Muon Collider in the same ring. 

Finally, let us remind that the EMC effect was discovered in 
muon-nucleus  scattering  experiments.  The  proposed  ùúáA 
colliders will  provide opportunity to study this phenomenon 
in a much larger kinematic region. Overall, these colliders will 
pave the way for understanding nature of strong  interactions 
at the nuclear level. 

Scientific potential of the RHIC based muon-nucleus collider 
has been examined in [10,11]. Similar studies should be done 
for  FCC,  SppC,  HL-LHC,  HE-LHC  based ùúáA  colliders  as 
well.
