Summary

Since the ﬁrst detection in 2015 of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence
(B. Abbott and others 2016a), improvements to the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo
detectors have expanded our view into the universe for these signals. Searches of the of the
latest observing run (O3) have increased the number of detected signals to 90, at a rate of
approximately 1 per week (The LIGO Scientiﬁc Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration,
Abbott, et al. 2021; The LIGO Scientiﬁc Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, the
KAGRA Collaboration, et al. 2021). Future observing runs are expected to increase
this even further(Abbott and others 2020). Bayesian analysis of the signals can reveal
the properties of the coalescing black holes and neutron stars by comparing predicted
waveforms to the observed data (B. Abbott and others 2016b). The proliferating number
of detected signals, the increasing number of methods that have been deployed (Veitch
and others 2015; Ashton and others 2019; Lange, O’Shaughnessy, and Rizzo 2018), and
the variety of waveform models (Ossokine and others 2020; Khan et al. 2020; Pratten and
others 2021) create an ever-expanding number of analyses that can be considered.

Asimov is a python package which is designed to simplify and standardise the process
of conﬁguring these analyses for a large number of events.
It has already been used
in developing analyses in three major gravitational wave catalog publications (Abbott
and others 2021; The LIGO Scientiﬁc Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, Abbott,
et al. 2021; The LIGO Scientiﬁc Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, the KAGRA
Collaboration, et al. 2021). The source code of Asimov is archived to Zenodo (Williams
et al. 2021).

Statement of Need

While these developments are positive, they also bring considerable challenges. The ﬁrst
of these lies with the high rate at which gravitational waves can now be detected; thanks
to the improved sensitivity of the detectors they observe a much larger volume of space,
and the increasing size of the detector network has also increased the total time during
which observations occur. The second comes from developments in the analysis techniques
and related software. Development of these techniques has accelerated in a short period
of time, and the landscape of analysis software has become diverse. It is desirable to be
able to use these techniques with ease, but thanks to the highly distributed development
process which has produced them, they often have highly heterogeneous interfaces.

We developed asimov as a solution to both of these problems, as it is capable both of
organising and tracking a large number of on-going analyses, but also of performing setup
and post-processing of several diﬀerent analysis pipelines, providing a single uniform
interface. The software has been designed to be easily extensible, making integration with
new pipelines straight-forward.

In addition, ensuring that the large number of analyses are completed successfully, and
their results collated eﬃciently proved a formidable challenge when relying on “by-hand”
approaches. The LIGO Scientiﬁc Collaboration operate a number of high-throughput
computing facilities (the LIGO Data Grid [LDG]) which are themselves controlled by the
htcondor scheduling system. asimov monitors the progress of jobs within the htcondor
ecosystem, resubmits jobs to the cluster which fail due to transient problems, such as
ﬁle I/O errors in computing nodes, and detects the completion of analysis jobs. Upon
completion of a job the results are post-processed using the PESummary python package
(Hoy and Raymond 2021), and humans can be alerted by a message posted by asimov
to a Mattermost or Slack channel. Interaction with htcondor will also allow jobs to be
submitted to the Open Science Grid in the future.

Prior to the development of asimov analyses of gravitational wave data had been conﬁgured
and run manually, or had relied on collections of shell scripts. Asimov therefore constitutes
an new approach, designed to be both more maintainable, and to improve the reproduciblity
of results generated by analysis pipelines.

Implementation

In order to produce a uniform interface to all of its supported pipelines, asimov implements
a YAML-formatted conﬁguration ﬁle, which is referred to as its “production ledger”. This
ﬁle is used to specify the details of each event to be analysed, details about the data
sources, and details of each pipeline which should be applied to the speciﬁed data. This
allows identical settings to be used with multiple diﬀerent pipelines, with a minimum
of conﬁguration, reducing the possibility of transcription errors between setups. In the
current implementation of Asimov the production ledger is stored using an issue tracker on
a custom Gitlab instance, with each issue representing a diﬀerent event. This approach
is, however, neither ﬂexible nor scalable, and future development will use an alternative
means of storing the ledger.

Asimov simpliﬁes the process of gathering and collating the various settings and data-
products required to conﬁgure an analysis. These include data quality information: data
from gravitational wave detectors can be aﬀected by non-stationary noise or “glitches”
which must be either be removed before analysis, or the analysis must be conﬁgured to
mitigate their eﬀect on ﬁnal results. These data are provided to Asimov in YAML format
from the appropriate team, and used to make appropriate selections in the analysis.

The analysis of gravitational wave data is generally performed within a Bayesian framework,
which requires prior probability distributions being chosen before the analysis. Ideally
these distributions would be chosen such that a very broad range of parameter values is
explored and sampled, however this is computationally impractical, and to improve the
speed and eﬃciency of the analysis a rough guess of the parameters is required. This is
normally determined by “preliminary” analyses, rougher, rapid analyses performed, which
are themselves informed by the detection process which identiﬁed the event in the raw
detector data. These prior data are analysed by the PEConfigurator tool to determine
appropriate prior ranges, and settings for the waveform approximant to be used in the
analysis.

The calibration of the detectors; the correspondance between the strain on the detector
and the intensity of light at the interferometer’s exit port, can change over the course of an

observing run. The uncertainty in this quantity is marginalised by many of the analyses,
which requires data ﬁles to be collected and provided to the analyses.

Once the correct data, settings, and calibration information has been identiﬁed and
collected it is possible to conﬁgure analyses. Asimov allows analyses to be described as a
dependency tree, allowing the output data products from one analysis to be used as an
input for another. This is often useful for coordinating the determination of the PSD of
the analysed data.

Each pipeline is conﬁgured with a mixture of conﬁguration ﬁles and command-line argu-
ments. Asimov produces the appropriately-formatted conﬁguration ﬁle for each pipeline
using a template and substitutions from the production ledger. The appropriate command
line program is then run for the given pipeline, in order to produce an execution environ-
ment and submission data for the htcondor scheduling system. This is then submitted to
the LDG, and the job id is collected and stored by asimov.

It is then possible to automatically monitor the progress of jobs on the LDG, produce a
webpage summarising the status of all on-going analyses, and detect the completion of
jobs and initialise post-processing.
