Abstract

Most businesses impose a supervisory hierarchy on employees to facilitate management, decision-
making, and collaboration. In contrast, routine inter-employee communication patterns within
workplaces tend to emerge more naturally, as a consequence of both supervisory relationships
and the needs of the organization. Scholars of organizational management have proposed theo-
ries relating organizational trees to communication dynamics and measures of business perfor-
mance. Separately, network scientists have studied the topological structure of communication
patterns in diﬀerent types of organizations. However, the nature of the relationship between a
formal organizational structure and emergent communications between employees remains un-
clear. In this paper, we study associations between organizational hierarchy and communication
dynamics among approximately 200,000 employees of a large software company in May 2019.
We propose new measures of communication reciprocity and new shortest-path distances for
trees to characterize the frequency of messages passed up, down, and across the organizational
hierarchy. By dividing the organization into 88 teams – organizational trees rooted at the senior
leadership level – we identify distinct communication network structures within and between
teams. These structures are related to the function of these teams within the company, includ-
ing sales, marketing, engineering, and research. We discuss the relationship of routine employee
communication patterns to supervisory hierarchies in this company, and empirically evaluate
several theories of organizational management and performance.

Introduction

Most organizations impose a supervisory hierarchy on their employees to facilitate management,
decision-making, and collaboration (Robbins, 2004; Galbraith, 2008). In contrast, routine interper-
sonal communication patterns within workplaces tend to emerge more naturally, as a consequence
of both supervisory relationships and the needs of the organization. “If the formal organization is
the skeleton of a company,” Krackhardt and Hanson (1993) analogize, “the informal is the central

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
nervous system driving the collective thought processes, actions, and relations of its business units.”
Understanding the relationship between these two networks is crucial to successful management of
an organization (Cross et al., 2007).

Scholars of organizational behavior and management have proposed theories relating social network
features to measures of business performance (Tichy et al., 1979; Krackhardt and Stern, 1988) and
researchers have described strategies to measure and improve communication networks within an
organization (Cross et al., 2007; Nielsen, 2016). Some of this work makes explicit claims about how
communication network features relate to organizational eﬀectiveness. For example, Krackhardt
and Stern (1988) conjecture that eﬀective organizations have a higher rate of between-team than
within-team communication. Alternatively, Hatch and Schultz (1997) and Holtzhausen (2002)
argue that communication is better in decentralized organizations in which “authority is dispersed
downward in the hierarchy.” Several authors claim that the highest-performing employees have
more communication network connections (Cross et al., 2002; Nielsen, 2016).

To evaluate these theories, management researchers, computer scientists, and network scientists
have proposed frameworks and methodologies for studying latent, or unmeasured, hierarchical
structure within interaction or communication networks (Capobianco and Molluzzo, 1979; Palus
et al., 2011; Fire and Puzis, 2016). One objective is to use communication network features to
classify individuals by rank or job title in the corresponding organizational hierarchy, thereby
uncovering network correlates of institutional position. A common approach is computing network
measures of centrality for employees, then ranking them in order of importance. For example,
Shetty and Adibi (2004) use entropy to measure importance of employees, and Namata et al.
(2006) use variations in email counts to rank employees. Rowe et al. (2007) rank individuals based
on a combination of communication ﬂow statistics such as average response time and topological
statistics such as the number of communication network cliques to which each employee belongs.
Hossain (2009) and Michalski et al. (2011) use classical centrality measures to rank employees, and
Wang et al. (2013) adapt the PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1999) for email networks, which
they call HumanRank. Zhang et al. (2009) assess supervised clustering techniques for predicting
missing job titles based on the number of emails sent and received by each employee. Dong et al.
(2015) ﬁnd that “structural holes” in the communication network are useful for identifying “high-
status” individuals, and that these individuals form a “rich club” community of employees that
is connected, balanced, and dense. Nurek and Michalski (2020) show that auxiliary employee
information, such as number of days of overtime worked, can improve classiﬁcation of job title.

Beyond classifying employees by rank or job title, there are three methods in the literature that at-
tempt to infer a tree-like structure (ideally the entire organizational hierarchy) using inter-employee
communication data. Creamer et al. (2007) segment employees into hierarchical levels, then link
them by an edge when two employees exchanged at least m emails, though this does not guarantee
the inferred organization is a tree. Maiya and Berger-Wolf (2009) use a distance-based approach
that assumes interactions are most common between supervisors and their direct reports, as well as
between organizational peers. Gupte et al. (2011) deﬁne “agony” as the diﬀerence in rank plus one
for communications that are directed from a lower-ranked to a higher-ranked employee, and infer
the organizational hierarchy that minimizes agony. While the hierarchical random graph model
from Clauset et al. (2008) infers a hierarchy speciﬁcally given a network input, it does not produce
a spanning tree, i.e. a tree with a vertex set equal to that of the input graph, and therefore its
objective is diﬀerent than the aforementioned methods.

Much of the methodology used to study the relationship between organizational hierarchy and
communication patterns (and much of what is known about this relationship) comes from anal-
yses of the Enron email corpus (Klimt and Yang, 2004), which consists of email communications
among a group of senior employees of the ﬁrm in advance of its collapse in 2001. Appendix Table
A.1 shows a summary of these methods. Despite the repeated analysis of this data, the full or-
ganizational hierarchy of Enron employees is not publicly available: the Enron email corpus only
consists of 158 employees that mostly belong to upper management. More insidiously, insights
gained from analyses of the Enron data may reﬂect features of this uniquely dysfunctional corpo-
rate environment: observed associations between the email network and organizational hierarchy in
this failing business may not be representative of more successful organizations. Indeed, Eckhaus
and Sheaﬀer (2018) use sentiment analysis to show that a semantic measure of “hubris” in email
content increases closer to the Enron collapse. Similarly, Diesner and Carley (2005) argue that
during the crisis, communication transcended the formal positions more than in previous months.
Consequently, it is essential to move beyond the study of the Enron corpus in order to understand
how an organization’s structure relates to its communication dynamics.

Toward this end, researchers have conducted several empirical analyses of other organizations, but
each is limited in scope. Holtzhausen (2002) study a South African ﬁnancial services organization
to assess the relationship between decentralization and communication. However, both communi-
cation and decentralization were only measured via survey response rather than via communication
logs and the actual organizational hierarchy. Guimera et al. (2006) characterize a university email
network and relate it to the community structure within the institution. Similarly, Boeva et al.
(2017) study a telecommunications company to evaluate metrics for comparing the formal organiza-
tion to the informal communication structure, and Sims et al. (2014) study communication patterns
within Los Alamos National Laboratory through email records. In all three of these studies, or-
ganizational structures are coarsely measured and communication dynamics are only considered
between units consisting of many individuals – colleges and administrative blocks in Guimera et al.
(2006), divisions in Boeva et al. (2017), and programs/projects in Sims et al. (2014) – rather than
between individual employees.

How do emergent communication dynamics relate to organizational hierarchy in a large and success-
ful organization? Are communication network centrality measures a good proxy for organizational
position? What is the relationship between organizational rank and frequency of communication?
Empirically testing organizational theories, especially those postulating relationships between net-
work centrality measures and organizational position, would require data from a large organization’s
individual-level organizational hierarchy with ﬁnely observed communication patterns between all
employees. Availability of replicates – data from subgroups or teams within the organization –
would permit testing of organizational theories across business task areas.

In this paper, we study the relationship between the formal organizational hierarchy and emergent
email communication dynamics among 241,718 employees at a large software company in May
2019. The data set is larger than any other organization described in the literature and consists of
each employee’s location in the company’s supervisory/reporting hierarchy, as well as monthly email
communication counts between all pairs of employees. We characterize the topological distance and
direction of email messages passed up, down, and across the organizational hierarchy. By dividing
the organization into 88 teams – organizational trees rooted at the senior leadership level – we
identify distinct communication network structures within and between teams. We also evaluate
established methods for latent structure estimation and employee rank classiﬁcation using the email

3

communication network, and assess their correspondence to the true organizational tree across the
whole organization and within individual teams. We conclude with a discussion of the relationship
between routine employee communication patterns and the supervisory hierarchy, and empirically
evaluate several theories of organizational management and performance.

2 Data

Data used in this analysis consist of email communications between employees and the organi-
zational hierarchy of all employees. Email communications consist of monthly counts of emails
between pairs of employees distinguished by sender and recipient. A total of 26.8 million emails
between employees are represented in these counts. The organizational data are represented by
directional reporting relationships between employees. Unique anonymous employee identiﬁers link
employees across both data sets. A total of 241,718 unique employee identiﬁers are present across
the data sets, with 89% present in both data sets. We construct two networks by selecting records
belonging to employees present in both data sets. In the directed email communications network,
nodes correspond to employees and edges are weighted by the total number emails over one month.
The weighted adjacency matrix A consists of elements Auv = # emails sent from employee u to v.
The organizational tree is constructed using directional reporting relationships, where the Chief
Executive Oﬃcer is the root. Nodes in the organizational tree represent employees and edges
represent (unweighted) reporting relationships.

To accommodate the existence of divisions with distinct business roles within the company, we
divide the organization into sub-organizations consisting of sub-trees of the organizational hierarchy,
which we call teams. This allows us to compare the teams for insight into how organizational
structures aﬀect communication. To construct teams, we ﬁrst identify a set of team leaders, deﬁned
as employees two steps below the CEO in the organizational chart. A team’s organizational tree
is deﬁned as the rooted tree with the team leader as the root, which is a a subtree of the entire
organizational tree. Its corresponding email network is the email communications network induced
by all of the organizational descendants of the team leader; the team email network is a subgraph
of the entire email network. Because not all employees are present in both the email network and
organizational tree, we take the intersection of the nodes in a team’s organizational tree and email
network and redeﬁne these networks as the subgraphs induced by this intersection. We exclude
teams with fewer than 100 members from this analysis. As a ﬁnal data cleaning step, we remove
isolated individuals to ensure that each team’s email network is connected. In order to preserve the
connected structure of the team’s organizational tree, we remove only individuals who did not send
or receive emails, and who are also terminal nodes in the team’s organizational tree. For individuals
higher in the team’s hierarchy (and therefore necessary to preserve the tree structure) who did not
send or receive any emails, we add a single directed edge originating from the individual on that
team with the highest out-degree. In total, we add only 788 edges, which is less than 0.004% of
all of the edges. Our ﬁnal email network is the union of all of the teams’ email networks plus all
of the original edges between the diﬀerent teams. By construction, each team is connected in the
organizational hierarchy, and the overall email network is also connected. It consists of 197k nodes
and 24.6 million edges.

For every node, we record several employee features. First, we record each employee’s supervisor,
which is the employee that the node reports to in the organizational tree. We say that a group

is the black dot from which all of the black edges emanate. (Right) The email network consisting

of teams is in the same division when their respective team leaders share a supervisor, who by
construction reports directly to the CEO. Finally, we record each node’s level, which is the number
of steps below the CEO in the organizational hierarchy. In total, the data set consists of a total
of 88 teams within 12 divisions. The sizes of the teams range from 99 to 19,458 (average 2,237,
standard deviation 3,612) and the depth of the teams, which is the maximum level of individuals
in the team, ranges from 5 to 13 (average 8.5, SD 1.7).

Figure 1 shows a visualization of the organizational tree and email network using the Gephi software
package (Bastian et al., 2009). Teams are colored with the same color scheme in both networks,
and colors are assigned to teams on a spectrum so that teams within the same division have similar
colors. On the left, black edges denote the top of the organizational tree, from the CEO to the
division leaders to the team leaders. Within teams, nodes are organized ﬁrst by level and then
by direct report. On the right, edges are directed and colored according to the source of emails,
i.e. the email sender. For visual clarity, we only include edges where emails were reciprocated and
at least 30 total were exchanged over the course of the month Guimera et al. (2006). We then
visualize the giant connected component, which consists of 94% of the original nodes (185,276) but
just 3% of the edges (762,936), thus making the visualization manageable to compute and clearer
to render.

3 Results

3.1 Email communication network

We ﬁrst study the degree distributions of the email network. The total degree is the number of email
relationships with nonzero weight, which we separate into in (received) and out (sent) degrees. The
average total degree is 250 (SD 402), and the median is 166 indicating a heavy right skew in the
degree distribution. The 95th percentiles of in and out degrees are 349 and 451, respectively. By
symmetry, since both sender and recipient are in the data set, the average in and out degrees are
equal to half of the average total degree. Figure 3 shows a rapid decay in degree frequency that
is consistent with patterns observed in other communication networks (Onnela et al., 2007). The
long tail indicates that there are a few employees who receive emails from thousands of employees,
and even fewer “super-senders” who send emails to tens of thousands of employees. This highly
skewed out-degree distribution has been been identiﬁed in prior work on communication patterns
in organizations, and may reﬂect activity related to email lists or listservs (Guimera et al., 2006;
Onnela et al., 2007).

Based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the total degrees follow a power-law distribution (∝ x−α)
with an estimated power law exponent of ˆα = 3.8 (SD 0.1) (Clauset et al., 2009; Gillespie, 2015).
However, we also include the recent scale-free analysis proposed in Broido and Clauset (2019) at
the team-level in Appendix A.2, which shows that 69 of the 88 teams are not scale-free. In and out
degrees also show a strong positive Pearson correlation (ρ = 0.66). The same trend holds (ρ = 0.71)
for total strength, which is the sum of the edge weights and represents the total volume of email. In
and out strength are the total number of emails received and sent, respectively. The average total
strength is 861 (SD 1204), the median total strength is 563, and the 95th percentiles of in and out
strength are 1,272 and 1,461, respectively.

Figure 2 shows the team adjacency matrix P . The (i, j) element is the proportion of pairs of
employees from teams i and j that have ever exchanged an email:

where ni is the number of employees in team i and 1(·) is the indicator function. The rows and
columns of the block matrix are sorted so that teams are clustered by their divisions.

Figure 2 shows that more emails are exchanged within teams than between teams, and the block
diagonal structure also shows that communication is more common within divisions. The average
diagonal (within team) is 0.091, which is the average proportion of pairs in the same team that ex-
changed at least one email in May 2019, and the average oﬀ-diagonal (between team) is 0.002. This
indicates that teams are dense but communication between teams is sparse. The last row/column
represents the CEO and their direct reports, which is evidence of the “rich club” phenomenon – the
tendency for central nodes to be embedded in dense communities – at the top of the organizational
chart (Colizza et al., 2006; Dong et al., 2015).

Figure 3 shows communication frequency within diﬀerent groups of employees: all employees, those
at the same level of the organizational hierarchy, those within the same division, those within the
same team, and those who share a supervisor. Communication patterns largely cluster around the
organizational structure: within teams, within divisions, within the same organizational level, and
among those with the same supervisor.

Krackhardt and Stern (1988) argue that successful organizations respond better to crises when
there are links between diﬀerent teams, hypothesizing that organizations with a positive EI-index
will respond eﬀectively to crises. The EI-index for team i and the organization EI-index are given
as

EI-index(i) =

EL(i) − IL(i)
EL(i) + IL(i)

and

EI-index =

(cid:80)

i

(cid:0)EL(i) − IL(i)(cid:1)
(cid:0)EL(i) + IL(i)(cid:1) ,

respectively, where EL(i) and IL(i) are the number of external (between teams) and internal
(within team) links, respectively, for team i:

EL(i) =

(cid:88)

u∈team i
v(cid:54)∈team i

1(Auv + Avu > 0)

and

IL(i) =

(cid:88)

u(cid:54)=v∈team i

1(Auv + Avu > 0) .

Figure 3 shows the distribution of EI-index values across teams; all but one team has a positive
EI-index (average 0.58, SD 0.23) with the EI-index of the organization as a whole equal to 0.53. In
contrast, the EI-indices for organizations reported by Krackhardt and Stern (1988) span the range
from -1 to 1, but are only reported on networks with very few (25-36) nodes. Though the number of
communication links as a proportion of all possible links is higher with teams than between teams
(see Figure 2), the unweighted EI-index is positive, indicating more external than internal links.
This happens because the number of external and internal links in the EI-index are not normalized
by the number of possible external and internal links, and there are far more employees who are
not a member of a given team (who could become external links) than there are employees who are
members of that team (who could become internal links). We also show in Figure 3 the distribution

of weighted EI-indices in which EL(i) and IL(i) are replaced with the total volume of external and
internal emails, respectively. Here, we see that 21 of the 88 teams have negative weighted EI-index
(average 0.15, SD 0.27).

3.2 Sent versus received emails

Next, we investigate the dynamics of emails that are sent by employees compared to those that are
received. Link reciprocity for directed networks has been well studied in both binary (Garlaschelli
and Loﬀredo, 2004) and weighted settings (Squartini et al., 2013). The reciprocity of our email
network is r = 0.31 (SD = 0.01) without the weights and r = 0.40 (SD = 0.14) with the weights.
However, we are interested in reciprocity at the individual node level. For this, we propose two
measures of node-level reciprocity. First, we measure the proportion of sent emails that are part
of reciprocated communications, which we refer to as sent reciprocation. That is, the proportion of
all email relationships in which u sent at least one email to v among all recipients v who ever sent
an email to u. We similarly measure the proportion of received emails, or received reciprocation.
For any individual u, these are deﬁned as

SR(u) =

(cid:80)

v 1(Auv > 0)1(Avu > 0)
v 1(Auv > 0)

(cid:80)

and

RR(u) =

(cid:80)

v 1(Avu > 0)1(Auv > 0)
v 1(Avu > 0)

(cid:80)

,

respectively. Figure 4 shows the diﬀerence of these proportions as a function of the employee’s level,
which we recall is the number of steps below the CEO in the organization, relative to the depth of
that employee’s team. This normalization ensures that employees that are at the bottom of their
team’s hierarchy are grouped together no matter how deep each team is. We see that employees
higher in the organization send emails that are reciprocated more often than they reciprocate emails
that they receive.

We also study the dynamics of sent and received emails as a function of position within one’s team.

Inspired by this diﬀerencing, we deﬁne sent position and received position for individual u as

SP(u) =

(cid:80)

v(cid:54)=u 1(Auv > 0) · Duv
v 1(Auv > 0)

(cid:80)

and

RP(u) =

(cid:80)

v(cid:54)=u 1(Avu > 0) · Dvu
v 1(Avu > 0)

(cid:80)

,

respectively. Thus +1 indicates every email was sent (received) to someone below in the organiza-
tion, -1 to someone above in the organization, and 0 proportionately above and below. Note that
each sum is normalized by the volume sent by the individual. The diﬀerence of these proportions
is shown in Figure 4 as a function of HP. The lower an employee is in the organization (the more
negative their HP), their sent position is, on average, higher than their received position. This is
not surprising since there is a strong negative correlation (ρ = −0.87) between SP and RP, which
implies that the diﬀerence is going to be more positive the higher you are in the organization. In
short, if an employee sends most emails down the organization, then most emails they receive are
likely to be sent from below, and vice-versa.

Finally, we evaluate the claim that the most important members in the organization – those closest
to the CEO – have more communication connections (Cross et al., 2002; Nielsen, 2016). Figure 4
shows that there is some truth to this claim: on average, both total degree and total strength in
the entire email network decrease for employees further down the organizational chart. We show
in Appendix Table A.2 that, assuming a linear model, the slopes of these trends are signiﬁcantly
less than zero. By looking at individual teams, we can assess importance with several additional
measures of node centrality that we cannot otherwise, for computational reasons, compute on the
entire email network. We compute four measures of centrality – betweenness, closeness, eigenvalue,
and authority (see Kolaczyk and Cs´ardi, 2014, for deﬁnitions) – shown in Appendix Figure A.3.

3.3 Reporting distance

Another approach to studying the relationship between organizational structure and frequency of
communication is to consider the distance between two employees in the organizational chart. A
path between individuals u and v is a sequence of edges connecting them and the path length is
deﬁned as the number of edges in a path. For each team, we compute three diﬀerent path length
measures between each pair of employees.

For any two employees u and v in the organizational chart, we count the number of steps up
nup(u, v) > 0 and the number of steps down, ndown(v, u) > 0 in the shortest path from u to
v. We describe how to compute these eﬃciently in Appendix A.5.1. Note that by symmetry,
nup(u, v) = ndown(v, u).

(Bottom) Left: Diﬀerence in the proportions SR and RR by relative position in the organization
hierarchy. Right: Diﬀerence in the signed proportions SP and RP by HP. In all of the plots, we bin
position into 10 equal groupings and we show the box plot within each bin along with a smoothed
curve (blue) of the individual (non-binned) data.

We deﬁne three notions of reporting distance as a function of these path length quantities: reporting
distance, signed reporting distance, and directed reporting distance. Respectively, these distances
between u and v are deﬁned as

RD(u, v) = nup(u, v) + ndown(u, v) ,
SRD(u, v) = nup(u, v) − ndown(u, v) ,
DRD(u, v) = RD(u, v) · sgn(cid:0)SRD(u, v)(cid:1) .

RD is just the ordinary shortest path length. SRD is a measure of the total distance travelled up
or down the organizational tree to get from u to v, which is zero if u and v have the same level,
is positive if u is lower than v in the organization, and is negative otherwise. SRD is close to the
deﬁnition of “agony” described in Gupte et al. (2011): Agony(u, v) = max{SRD(v, u) + 1, 0}.
Finally, DRD is the reporting distance signed by whether u is higher or lower than v in the
organization.

Note that only RD is a true distance; neither SRD nor DRD satisﬁes symmetry or the identity
of indiscernibles, but we prove in Appendix A.5.2 Proposition 1 that SRD satisﬁes the equality
SRD(u, v) = SRD(u, w) + SRD(w, v) for all w in the tree, and hence SRD is a quasipseudometric
on the set of employees (Kim, 1968).

Figure 5 shows the average number of emails exchanged between pairs of employees as a function of
these reporting distances. Appendix Figure A.4 shows analogous plots by communication frequency.
On average, the closer two employees are in the organizational tree, the more they communicate.

shown in Appendix Figure A.5.

This shows that communication increases exponentially by local proximity to others, similar to the
the global clustering in Figure 2.

Does the frequency of communication between employees depend on their relative ranks in the
organizational hierarchy? To assess whether the right and center plots of Figure 5 are symmetric
about zero, we perform two permutation tests. Let Sk = {(u, v) : DRD(u, v) = k}. We construct a
test statistic as

t(A) =

kmax(cid:88)

where kmax = maxu,v DRD(u, v). We obtain a null distribution by randomly permuting the number
of emails exchanged among pairs whose reporting distances are the same. That is, by permuting
the rows/columns of A within the sets Sk ∪ S−k for k = 1, . . . , kmax. For each replicate, we obtain
a new email network ˜A from which we can compute t( ˜A). By design, the relationship between
the DRD in the organizational tree and communication in ˜A is symmetric around 0 under this
permutation.

We repeat this 500 times within each team, except for the 4 teams that had > 10, 000 members,
whose permutations were too computationally expensive. We compare the empirical distribution of
the test statistic under permutation t( ˜A) with t(A), shown in Appendix Figure A.6. We ﬁnd that the
directed reporting diﬀerence is not symmetric about zero: that is, we reject the null hypothesis of
symmetry under this permutation distribution at the empirical 95% conﬁdence level. We similarly
perform a test of symmetry for the signed reporting distance using the same permutation scheme
but with the signed reporting distance SRD(u, v) in place of DRD(u, v). We ﬁnd the observed
result is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than what we would expect for a truly symmetric relationship.

3.4 Reconstructing the organizational hierarchy

Finally, we assess the existing methodology for reconstructing a tree structure from network data.
Each of the methods makes implicit assumptions about the relationship between the organiza-
tional hierarchy and emergent communication dynamics. Maiya and Berger-Wolf (2009) propose
a distance-based tree reconstruction model: “as the distance between individuals within a hierar-
chy grows, we assume the probability of interaction decays.” Gupte et al. (2011) propose a tree
reconstruction method that minimizes agony in the communication network, based on the idea
that “when people connect to other people who are lower in the hierarchy, this causes them social
agony” and thus “higher rank nodes are less likely to connect to lower rank nodes”. As a benchmark
method for tree reconstruction, we compute the minimum spanning tree of the communication net-
work (Prim, 1957). The minimum spanning tree of a graph is a tree with the same vertex set that
minimizes the sum of the edge weights. The implicit model for the minimum spanning tree is there-
fore one that minimizes the total emails exchanged between connected nodes. As this is contrary
to what we ﬁnd – the highest rates of communication are between connected nodes (Figure 5) – we
also implement the maximum spanning tree. We refer to these methods as “Distance,” “Agony,”
“Min ST,” and “Max ST,” respectively.

To evaluate these approaches, we apply each reconstruction method separately to the team com-
munication networks except for the 16 teams with > 3,000 members. For Agony, we implement
the algorithm from Tatti (2014). For each reconstruction method, we compute the distance from
the output tree to the true team organizational structure using the Frobenius distance and the
centrality distance (Donnat and Holmes, 2018). For the deﬁnitions and interpretations of these
tree distances, see Appendix A.6. We also measure the classiﬁcation rate of the “manager status”
implicit in the reconstruction method, in which a node is a “manager” if its in degree is positive,
i.e. the proportion of nodes whose leaf status in the reconstruction agrees with the true hierarchy.

We note that Agony guarantees the output is a Eulerian graph, which means that the in and out
degrees are equal, but this ensures that the graph is not a tree. Similarly, Distance is guaranteed
to produce a spanning graph, but a tree is not guaranteed since the maximum likelihood solution
can place a node as the child of an unobserved root. We ﬁnd, in fact, that using the email totals
as weights in the distance-based model results in this trivial solution (all nodes are children of an
unobserved root) for all of the teams, and consequently we only show the results based on the
unweighted communication networks.

The results are given in Figure 6 and show that neither Agony nor Distance perform consistently
better at reconstructing features of the organizational hierarchy than the baseline. To understand
why, recall that Agony is based on the hypothesis that higher ranking nodes are less likely to
communicate with lower ranking nodes. Under this implicit theory of communication dynamics,
communication frequency ought to be asymmetric around agony. However, we ﬁnd in Section 3.3
that communication frequency is not statistically signiﬁcantly asymmetric about SRD, which is
close to agony. Another reason this method performs poorly is that it assumes a linear relationship
between level diﬀerences in the organizational hierarchy and communication patterns, which is not
what we observe in Figure 5: there is more communication between high- and low-ranking employees
than would be expected if communication decreased monotonically with reporting distance. This

can be interpreted as less friction between far individuals and these direct lines of communication
are suggestive of small-world paths within the organization. Gupte et al. (2011) noted that such
non-linearity could be an interesting direction for future work. This non-linearity also primarily
explains why the distance-based method from Maiya and Berger-Wolf (2009) fails to reconstruct
the true organizational hierarchy.

Finally, we note that the Frobenius distance, which counts edge and non-edge discrepancies equally
(cid:1) possible edges) and
is artiﬁcially low for “Distance” since a tree only has n − 1 edges (out of (cid:0)n
2
Distance tends to output a graph with fewer edges. On the other hand, it is artiﬁcially high for
Agony since Agony produces a Eulerian graph that tends to have many edges.

4 Discussion

In this study, we ﬁnd that in a large and successful software company, communication patterns
have a strong association with organizational structure and that communication between employees
increases with their organizational proximity, both globally across the organization (Figure 2) and
locally within teams (Figure 3). Figure 2 also provides evidence of the “rich club” phenomenon at
the top of the organization in which the most central employees are embedded in dense communities
(Colizza et al., 2006; Dong et al., 2015). Similarly, Figure 4 and Appendix Figure A.3 show
that measures of employees’ centrality or importance in the communication network are larger for
employees higher in the organizational chart, in agreement with several substantive theories of
organizational behavior (Namata et al., 2006; Michalski et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013).

Inspired by the use of hierarchical diﬀerences in the hierarchical position metric (Boeva et al.,
2017), we have introduced new statistical measures of communication reciprocity. We ﬁnd that
information ﬂows asymmetrically – more frequently up than down the organizational hierarchy –
and that reciprocation of communication depends on employees’ position in the organization (Fig-
ure 4). In particular, high-ranking employees send emails that are reciprocated more often than
they reciprocate emails. This ﬁnding supports agony (Gupte et al., 2011) as a useful measure of or-
ganizational distance, since communication frequency decreases as the distance between employees
increases. However, we ﬁnd that the emergent communication dynamics are much more complex
than those predicted by existing theories. Consequently the reconstruction methods based on those
overly simplistic theories inadequately capture the true relationships between these topological

latent social hierarchy in which more popular individuals (higher in the social hierarchy) are less
likely to communicate with individuals below them in the social hierarchy. However, based on the
lack of signiﬁcance of our permutation test about the relationship between agony (equivalent to
signed reporting distance) and communication frequency, as well as the poor performance of the
agony-based reconstruction method in Figure 6, this theory may not be an accurate model for how
communication works in an organization, which is not surprising since we should expect information
to ﬂow both up and down in a functioning organization. Similarly, Maiya and Berger-Wolf (2009)
assume communication decreases monotonically with reporting distance, which is not what we ﬁnd
in Figure 5. Instead, a more realistic distance-based method for organizations might encourage
“small-world” links between upper management and low-level employees, as well as asymmetric
communication up and down the hierarchy.

There are several limitations in this work. We were unable to match 11% of employees across the
communication and organizational structures, which could aﬀect team and global summary mea-
sures. In particular, if the missing employees had roles or structural positions substantially unlike
those of observed employees, this could result in selection bias that might alter the associations we
found between network characteristics and role. The temporal resolution of communication data
is another possible limitation: although our measures of communication are observed rather than
surveyed, the counts are aggregated over the entire month. For this reason, we have not conducted
a temporal/longitudinal analysis of communication dynamics. We also do not have information
about individual emails and multiple recipients, which prevents us from ﬁltering out mass emails
from super-senders (Guimera et al., 2006; Onnela et al., 2007) and from studying who initiates
communication as a function of position in the hierarchy. Similarly, we do not have meta-data on
the employees and teams. Most conspicuously, we are lacking productivity/performance metrics
that would allow us to make concrete business suggestions about how to optimize the organizational
structure if we had productivity measures on teams or employees. However, this suggests a causal
analysis in order to disentangle whether organization links facilitate communication, or if people in
dense organizations are naturally more communicative. Additionally, more contextual information
(e.g. tenure at the company, previous positions within the company, projects assigned during the
analysis time, etc.) would allow for more substantive interpretations of the results. Finally, com-
putations for the non-degree centrality measures, the reporting distances, and the reconstruction
methods were not feasible on the entire email network, and it is possible that the individual team
results are not reﬂective of the entire organization.

The study of organizational communication – in large and successful businesses – is still an emerg-
ing ﬁeld. As we have shown, some theories of organization and communication capture important
features of real-world communication patterns. But these theories may be too simplistic to ade-
quately explain or predict organizational structures using communication data alone. Empirical
validation of organizational theories in a real data set, as we have tried to do here, is one way for
management scholars to ensure that substantive hypotheses about communication dynamics match
reality. Better measures of directional communication ﬂow within organizational structures – like
the signed and directional reporting distances proposed above – could help researchers understand
these emergent communication dynamics. Likewise, improved methods for reconstructing organi-
zations should be rooted in realistic ideas about how directional communication dynamics relate
to the organizational structure, rather than facile theories of employee popularity or importance.
Development of realistic explanatory models of communication conditional on an organizational
tree might permit more accurate reconstruction of organizational trees.

A.1 Analyses of communication and organizational structure in the Enron cor-

pus

The Enron email corpus consists of email communications among a group of senior employees of
the ﬁrm in advance of its collapse in 2001 (Klimt and Yang, 2004), and has been used to study
the relationship between organizational hierarchy and communication patterns. We summarize
relevant analyses in Table A.1.

A.2 Scale-free analysis

A primary feature of network analyses is the study of the network’s degree distribution, and one
of the most prevalent beliefs is the ubiquity of scale-free networks (Albert and Barab´asi, 2002).
However, a more recent survey concludes that scale-free networks are rare (Broido and Clauset,
2019). Using the same methodology, we classify the the email networks at the team level, which is
summarized in Figure A.1. Note that in our analysis, we include every team even though only 9 of
the 88 teams satisﬁes the original inclusion criteria from Broido and Clauset (2019) that the mean
degree is less than

n.

A.3 Comparing network summary statistics

There are many network summary statistics that we can compute for both the email network and
organizational tree. In Figure A.2, we show four of the clearest relationships between individual
network summary statistics of a team’s organizational tree (x-axis) and their corresponding email
network (y-axis). Starting at the top left and going clockwise, the Pearson correlations are ρ =
−0.84, 0.75, 0.58, and −0.65.

A.4.1 Linear model of position on degree/strength

Figure 4 shows that both degree and strength are negatively associated with position in the hier-
archy. That is, the lower an employee is in their team’s hierarchy, the lower their degree/strength.
To assess whether this relationship is signiﬁcant, we run four linear models of position against (log)
degree and (log) strength. Table A.2 provides the coeﬃcient estimates and standard errors, which
reveals that all four relationships are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than zero.

A.4.2 Centrality measures

We want to assess whether importance in the email network corresponds to importance in the
organization. We assess this for each team and importance in the team’s organization is deﬁned as
relative position. For importance in the email network, we consider four measures of centrality –
betweenness, closeness, eigenvalue, and authority (see Kolaczyk and Cs´ardi, 2014, for deﬁnitions)
– which is shown in Figure A.3.

A.5 Path analysis

A.5.1 Computing nup and ndown

In a tree T , there is a unique shortest path between any two nodes u, v ∈ V (T ). This shortest path
can take steps both up and down the tree, and hence its length is the sum of the number of steps
up and down, nup(u, v) + ndown(u, v). Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to compute the shortest path
lengths between the nodes in a graph, and can be modiﬁed to compute nup(u, v) and ndown(u, v)
as follows.

First, assume T is directed down, i.e. the in-degree of the root node is 0 and all other nodes have
in-degree equal to 1. Create the transpose of T that is directed up, say T T , and then create the
graph G = T ∪ T T . Note that the adjacency matrix of G is now symmetric. We equip weights to
the edges of G such that,

Guv =


p if Tuv = 1

if T T
uv = 1
q

else
0

,

where p and q are prime and p >> q. Next, run Dijkstra’s algorithm on G, which will return the
shortest (weighted) path lengths between all nodes, say d(u, v). We can ﬁnally recover the desired

Both signed reporting distance and directed reported distance can be negative, so neither is a
true metric. Moreover, neither satisﬁes the identity of indiscernibles, since any two nodes that are
on the same level will have SRD and DRD equal to zero. Likewise, neither satisﬁes symmetry.
However, they both satisfy a negative symmetry since SRD(u, v) = −SRD(v, u) and DRD(u, v) =
−DRD(v, u).

DRD does not satisfy the triangle inequality. As one counterexample, suppose w reports directly to
v, and both u and v are direct reports to some fourth node. Then DRD(u, v) = 0, but DRD(u, w) =
−3 and DRD(w, v) = 1.

Interestingly, SRD satisﬁes the triangle equality.

Proposition 1. Let T be a tree. For any u, v, w ∈ V (T ),

SRD(u, v) = SRD(u, w) + SRD(w, v) .

Proof. Let u, v, w ∈ V (T ). If any two nodes are the same, then the result is trivial since nup(u, u) =
ndown(u, u) = 0.

Next, let u, v, w ∈ V (T ) all be diﬀerent. Suppose w lies on the shortest path from u to v. It follows
that RD(u, v) = RD(u, w) + RD(w, v). Thus

nup(u, v) + ndown(u, v) = nup(u, w) + ndown(u, w) + nup(w, v) + ndown(w, v)

=⇒ nup(u, v) − ndown(u, v) = nup(u, w) + ndown(u, w) + nup(w, v) + ndown(w, v) − 2ndown(u, v)

=⇒

SRD(u, v) = nup(u, w) − ndown(u, w) + nup(w, v) − ndown(w, v)

(cid:16)

− 2

(cid:17)
ndown(u, v) − ndown(u, w) − ndown(v, w)

= SRD(u, w) + SRD(w, v) .

The last equality is due to the fact that, since w lies on the shortest path from u to v, ndown(u, v) =
ndown(u, w) + ndown(v, w).

On the other hand, suppose w does not lie on the shortest path from u to v. We proceed by induction
on the length of the shortest path from u to w. If RD(u, w) = 1, then, u and w are connected.
Without loss of generality, say nup(u, w) = 1 and ndown(u, w) = 0. Then the shortest path from w
to v is just one edge longer than the shortest path from u to v. That is, RD(w, v) = 1 + RD(u, v).

22

Thus

nup(u, v) + ndown(u, v) = nup(w, v) + ndown(w, v) − 1

=⇒ nup(u, v) − ndown(u, v) = nup(w, v) + ndown(w, v) − 1 − 2ndown(u, v)

=⇒

SRD(u, v) = nup(u, w) − ndown(u, w) + nup(w, v) − ndown(w, v)

− 2 − 2ndown(u, v) + 2ndown(w, v)

= SRD(u, w) + SRD(w, v) .

The penultimate equality uses the fact that nup(u, w) − ndown(u, w) = 1 To see the last equality,
observe that since nup(u, w) = 1, we know that u must report directly to w. Furthermore, because
w does not lie on the path from u to v, the ﬁrst step on the shortest path from u to v must go
down. Therefore, the shortest path from w to v must go through u. It follows that ndown(w, v) =
ndown(u, v) + 1, hence

2 − 2ndown(u, v) + 2ndown(w, v) = 2 · (cid:0)1 − ndown(u, v) + ndown(w, v)(cid:1) = 0 .

With our basis for induction established, assume that SRD(u, v) = SRD(u, w) + SRD(w, v) holds
for RD(u, w) = k. We are done if we can show the result holds when RD(u, w) = k + 1.

If RD(u, w) = k + 1, then there exists a point z on the shortest path from u to w. Since RD(u, w) =
RD(u, z) + RD(z, w), we know that RD(u, z) ≤ k and RD(z, w) ≤ k. By assumption, it follows
that SRD(u, v) = SRD(u, z) + SRD(z, v) and SRD(z, v) = SRD(z, w) + SRD(w, v). Putting these
together, we have

SRD(u, v) = SRD(u, z) + SRD(z, w) + SRD(w, v)

= nup(u, z) − ndown(u, z) + nup(z, w) − ndown(z, w) + SRD(w, v)
= nup(u, w) − ndown(u, w) + SRD(w, v)
= SRD(u, w) + SRD(w, v) .

Note that the penultimate equality follows from the fact that z is on the shortest path from u to
w. Our induction is complete and concludes our proof.

A.5.3 Communication frequency

Figure A.4 shows the communication frequency between pairs of employees as a function of the
reporting distances. As in Figure 5, on average, the closer two employees are in the organizational
tree, the more frequently they communicate.

A.5.5 Permutation tests

We performed two permutation tests to see whether the right and center plots of Figure 5 are
symmetric about zero. Recall that our test statistic is

where Sk = {(u, v) : DRD(u, v) = k} and kmax = maxu,v DRD(u, v).
In Figure A.6, we show
our null distributions, which we obtained by randomly permuting the number of emails exchanged
among pairs whose reporting distances are the same. The null distributions are aggregated over
500 diﬀerent permutations within each team, except for the 4 teams that had > 10, 000 members,
whose permutations were too computationally expensive. The empirical test statistics are given by
the red lines.

The ﬁrst measures how many edges are in agreement between the estimated tree, ˆT , and the true
tree, T . The second measures the agreement of centrality measures for the nodes in each graph and
“a change in centrality can be understood as a drift of the node away from (or toward) the core of
the network” (Donnat and Holmes, 2018).
