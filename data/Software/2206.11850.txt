Nowadays, many accidents, malfunctions, and quality defects are happening in production systems due to Human Errors 
Probability  (HEP).  Human  Reliability  Analysis  (HRA)  methods  have  been  proposed  to  measure  the  HEP  based  on 
Performance  Shaping  Factors  (PSFs),  but  these  methods  do  not  have  a  procedure  to  select  the  effective  PSFs  and 
consider the PSFs dependency. In this paper, we propose an Artificial Neural Network based Human Reliability Analysis 
(ANNHRA)  in  cooperation  with  Response  Surface  Method  (RSM).  This  framework  uses  the  advantage  Systematic 
Human Error Reduction and Prediction Approach (SHERPA) method to quantify the PSFs and the ANN and RSM to 
consider  the  PSFs  dependency  and  select  the  most  effective PSFs.  This  framework  decreases  the  time  and  cost  and 
increases the accuracy of HRA. The proposed framework has been applied to a real case and the provided results show 
that human reliability can be calculated more effectively using ANNHRA framework.

In each production system, human error is the main source of concern for managers. Although 
many production systems have been automated by using digital machines and equipment, human 
error has not been eliminated considerably and a high proportion of errors in many industries are 
derived from humans. For example, in chemical production systems 60-90% of error happens 
because of human failure [1]. 

Human errors can be divided into two categories according to their impact on production systems. 
The  low  and  high  impact  categories.  Low  impact  leads  to  produce  poor  quality  and  defective 
production [2]. But in critical industries such as nuclear or chemical industries, human errors in 
the high impact category can cause a fatal failure and impose a high risk to production systems 
[3].  Human  errors  also  decrease  productivity  and  increase  undesirable  costs  such  as  idle  cost, 
backorder cost, and quality cost.

Many  researchers  investigated  human  error  and  attempted  to  quantify  the  Human  Errors  Probability 
(HEP) as a function of the human type, work type and environmental factors [4]. These attempts lead to 
propose Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) methods by researchers. 

237 

The HRA methods were developed with the quantitative methods in the first generation and the qualitative 
methods in the second one, and in recent year dynamic HRA attracted the researchers' attention as the 
third generation [5]-[6]. The first generation includes many methods such as Technique for Human Error 
Rate Prediction (THERP) [7], Human Cognition Reliability (HCR)[8]. The first generation methods use a 
simple  "fits"  or  "doesn’t  fit"  dichotomy  to  match  the  error  scenario  to  error  identification  and 
quantification. But second generation methods such as Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method 
(CREAM)[9] and [10] use a theory-based error taxonomy and complex match of error scenarios to error 
identification  and  quantification.  In  these  methods  Performance  Shaping  Factors  (PSFs)  with  multiple 
levels of assignment utilized to indicate degrees of degraded or enhance performance relative to nominal.

In recent years, dynamic HRM has become an interesting issue for study since many parameters influence 
human reliability and the effect of these parameters on human reliability cannot be calculated by the exact 
algorithm. Chang and Mosleh [11]-[15] room operating crew in nuclear power plants to use this method in 
proposed  the  Information  Decision  and  Action  in  Crew  (IDAC)  context  for  HRA.  The  model  was 
developed to predict the responses of the control Probabilistic Risk Assessments (PRA). Trucco and Leva 
[16]  developed  a  new  probabilistic  cognitive  simulator  (PROCOS)  to  obtain  the  errors  of  human  in 
operational  systems,  they  used  the  quantification  susceptibilities  of  the  first-generation  HRA  with  a 
cognitive evaluation for an operator. Kim et al.[17]  proposed a scheme to classify the erroneous behaviors 
identified  by  simulator  data.  Pasquale  et  al.  [18]  proposed  the  Simulator  for  Human  Error  Probability 
Analysis  (SHERPA),  and  utilized  the  advantages  of  the  simulation  technique  and  the  traditional  HRA 
methods to model human behavior and obtain the error probability for a specific scenario in production 
systems. In these models, the effect of PSFs has been simulated and the results are used to predict the 
HEP [18]. Pandya et al. [19] proposed a methodology to support a systematic and traceable process to 
develop the generic task type–performance-influencing factor structure, to ease the review of the HRA 
process.  Pandya  et  al.  [20]  proposed  a  model  for  HRA  quantification  based  on  expert  judgment 
aggregation. Laumann investigated the quality criteria for qualitative HRA method to make the HRA results 
more accurate [21].  

Simulation of the PSFs effect on HEP requires the occurrence probability of each PSFs and the manner 
of PSFs effect on HEP. In many real situations, these data are not available or accurate. Also, most HRA 
methods have been developed in a specific context, such as nuclear power plants and fewer methods have 
been  proposed  for  production  systems.  Also,  some  HRA  methods  such  as  HEART  (Human  Error 
Assessment and Reduction Technique) and SHERPA proposed some PSFs and calculate the HEP base 
on these factors, lack of attention to the factors dependency is one of the shortcomings of these methods 
that causes error in HEP calculation. All PSFs should be considered together to investigate their effect on 
human error. Another issue is that not all PSFs need to be used and the most important ones should be 
considered to reduce the cost and time of the HRA. In this paper, we propose a method to eliminate the 
mentioned defects by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Response Surface Method (RSM), The ANN 
considers the PSFs dependency and RSM selects the most important PSFs. This method reduces the cost, 
and time in HEP calculation and makes results closer to reality. This method uses the neural network to 
calculate the HEP based on several environmental, work (duration, type), and human (age, sex) factors and 
their dependency, and RSM to investigate the effect of each PSF on human error and eliminated PSFs with 
insignificant effect. Since we consider factors dependency, the results are more accurate and reliable.  

 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the research methodology and describes 
the HEP calculation method, PSFs and ANN. Section 3 is the finding and discussion section that describes 
the ANNHRA framework and proposes the framework procedure for a real case, and finally, Section 4 
concludes the paper. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 | Research Methodology 

In this section, the methods used in this paper such as HEP calculation method, PSFs, ANN and RSM 
are presented. 

2.1 | Human Error Probability Calculation  

238 

According to The THERP method, HRA aims to find the contribution of human reliability to the system 
reliability, that is to say, the aim is to predict human error probability and assess the total unreliability of 
human–machine  systems  likely  to  be  caused  by  a  human  in  association  with  equipment,  machines, 
procedures, and human characteristics which influence the production system [22]. The first step in the 
HRA is error identification. In this step, all probable errors should be identified with their consequences. 
The second step is calculating the occurrence probability of each identified error and the final step is 
the reduction of error probability. Kirwan [23] proposed that the HEP can be calculated as follows: 

HEPnominal=

OEN
. 
PEN

(1) 

The OEN is the number of occurred errors and PEN is the number of potential errors. For example, if 
the opportunity for a specific error is 20 times and the error occurs 10 times the HEP is equal to 50%. 
It should be noted that data gathering to use this formula is not simple, some researchers presented that 
HEP is derived from four Contextual Control Modes (CoCoMs), scrambled, opportunistic, tactical, and 
strategic  in  the  first  generation  and  several  PSFs  such  as  stress  and  complexity,  but  dynamic  HRA 
presented that HEP is a result of human performance factor relations and dependencies such as work 
type and work time [24]. 

2.2 |  Performance Shaping Factors 

PSF  was  advocated  by  Swain  [25]  first  time  and  is  usually  treated  as  ‘‘the  regulation  item  for  the 
introduction of the error rate’’ or ‘‘the providing items for the prediction of human error’’. PSFs are the 
aspects of human behavior and the context that can impact human resource performance, these factors 
were viewed in terms of the effects, they might exert on human performance such as work efficiency 
and  system  reliability.  Many  PSFs  and  categories  have  been  proposed  by  researchers  for  different 
systems such as nuclear or power plants [26], [27] and [28]. 

In practice, the number of PSFs that are included in HRA methods lies between these 1 to 60 PSFs. For 
example, the SPAR-H method [22], which is widely used in the US nuclear industry, includes eight PSFs. 
The internationally widely used CREAM [29] uses nine PSFs. Boring studied the important PSFs and 
proposed 8 PSFs that are considered in common HRA methods [30]. These PSFs are as follows:

  Work process. 

PSFs may have a negative impact or a positive impact on human error. When the influencing factor 
represents a positive impact, it corresponds to a value less than one; which is used to decrease the HEP 
value. Also, the PSF represents a negative impact, it corresponds to a value greater than one and leads 
to decreases the HEP. The total impact of PSFs is calculated using Eq. (2). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Total PSFs Impact=IPSF1*IPSF2*…*IPSF8. 

(2) 

Eq. (2) shows that the total impact of PSFs is the multiplication of each PSF impact (IPSF). The HEP 
formulation has been shown by Eq. (3). 

239 

HEPcomposite=

HEPnominal.PSFtotal
. 
HEPnominal.(PSFtotal-1)+1

(3) 

Although Eq. (3) is used to obtain the human error probability considering the PSFs in some mentioned 
methods. In this paper, we investigate the impact of PSFs on HEP separately, the PSFs impact on HEP 
are evaluated by ANN. That is to say, in the proposed method the value of HEPcomposite is predicted by 
ANN and there is no need to calculate the HEPnominal in the first step.

2.3 | Artificial Neural Network 

ANN are well known since they can process a huge amount of information through an interconnected 
network with several nodes in many layers [31]. The information flow is related to the network architecture 
which mimics the one present in the neurons of the human body. Since ANN is an imitation of nature and 
the human body, it includes several steps such as recognition, verification, optimization, and prediction. 
The ANN aims to understand the effect of parameters (inputs) on a result (output) in different systems. 
After selecting the input parameters, the learning process starts with the training and testing steps. Also, it 
can be done after standardizing and eliminating the outliers of the input parameters [32]. The schema of 
ANN has been shown in Fig. 1.

In the learning process, different networks can be selected and examined for obtaining their performance 
by  altering  the  layers  and  nodes  number,  the  transfer  functions' shape,  and  the  learning  algorithm. To 
evaluate the accuracy of different networks, Eq. (4) minimizes the overall error between the targets and 
calculated values.

In this paper, we use the ANN to obtain the effect of PSFs on the HEP. In the prior researches, some 
coefficients have been proposed for each PSF that show the effect of PSF on the HEP. For example, the 
SPAR-H method proposed a table for PSFs value in different situations and the systems. Table 1 shows 
the weight for different manners of available time as a PSF. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1. The PSF weight for available time.

As could be seen in Table 1 the system and environment have no effect on PSF weight, but the weight 
of the PSF level should be varied based on system type and environment conditions. Considering this 
fact, all PSF levels have some error and multiplication of this error leads to a significant error in total 
HEP.  

In this  paper,  we  provide  the  actual  effect  of the PSFs  level  by using  the  ANN  method.  Using  this 
method can make us sure that the total HEP value has not a significant error and is reliable. Selecting 
the important PSFs and the environmental conditions depends on the experts’ opinion and in experts’ 
opinion we confront a specific level of error and inconsistency. Using ANN can reduce this error and 
predict more accurate HEP value based on PSFs in different work environments.  

2.4 | RSM 

The RSM has been proposed by  box and his collaborators  [33]. This method was derived from the 
multi-dimensional graph to assess the fitness of the mathematical model. RSM consists of a group of 
techniques that aim to fit an empirical model based on the experimental data, to achieve this goal, linear 
or  square  polynomial  functions  are  employed  to  describe  the  system  studied  and,  to  optimize  the 
experimental conditions to propose the optimal configuration of input parameters [34]. RSM can be 
summarized in six steps. The first step is the selection of independent inputs that influence the results. 
The second step is designing an experimental matrix and carrying out the experiments according to the 
selected experimental matrix. The third step is fitting a function to obtain the mathematic–statistical 
treatment  of  experimental  data.  The  fitness  evaluation  of  the  obtained  model  is  the  fourth  step. 
Verification of the necessity and possibility of performing a displacement in direction for the optimal 
region  is  the  fifth  step.  Finally  providing  the  optimum  value  for  each  input  is  the  sixth  step.  The 
application of RSM in the proposed framework is described in the next section. 

3 | Finding & Discussion 

In this section, we propose the ANNHRA framework and its procedure to calculate the human error 
and reliability, and examine the effectiveness of the proposed framework using a set of data from a real 
case.  The  provided  results  verify  the  framework  effectiveness  in  human  error  and  human  reliability 
calculation. 

3.1 | ANNHRA Framework 

he proposed framework to assess human reliability is shown in Fig. 2. As could be seen the framework 
has two subsystems, the first is ANN that evaluates the effect of PSFs and the second is RSM which 
identifies the most effective PSFs in different systems. This framework will be repeated until the results 
converge. This framework proposed the HEP value and provide the most effective PSFs in different 
systems that lead to reduce the time and cost in data gathering and increase the accuracy of HEP value.

3.2 | Framework Procedure 

To illustrate the procedure of the proposed framework we investigated a real case. In this case, a lathing 
workshop with three human resources and 8 PSFs have been considered. The aim is to find the most 
important PSFs and their dependencies for calculating the HEP to reduce the cost of gathering information 
and sampling in the production system. First of all, we used some samples to provide HEP and ANN to 
predict HEP for other sets of PSFs. We considered several works with different conditions and calculated 
the related PSFs value according to the works and their implementation conditions. The PSFs multipliers 
like what was mentioned in Table 1 can be found in [35] and [36]. To calculate the HEP, we implemented 
a set of works by a set of workers and calculated the failure probability by doing works repeatedly (at least 
100 times for each work). Table 2 shows the HEP and PSFs for each work.

As could be seen, several combinations of PSFs and their effects on the HEP have been calculated 
according to work and the workers’ conditions. By using ANN, the framework aims to calculate the 
HEP and provide a function to determine the HEP according to PSFs. 

In  the  first  step,  the  PSFs  value  should  be  normalized  to  [0,1].  In  this  case,  a  simple  normalization 
scheme is adopted as follows: 

242 

j norm

PSFi

=

PSFi
j
PSFmax

.

The normalized PSFs and their related HEP are fed into the network shown in Fig. 3 for training. There 
are many algorithms for ANN training. These algorithms usually search ANN parameters that minimize 
the deviation of predicted values from the measured values. 

The proposed ANN has three layers: the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. It has 8 
inputs (number of PSFs) with one output (The HEP value). To overcome the over fitting problem, the 
hidden node number should not be very large. With some practical guidelines, this number is selected 
to be the same as the number of input nodes. 

Fig. 3. The ANN layers schema. 

The results of the proposed ANN for historical data are shown in Table 3. Since the ANN is initialized 
randomly before training, several replicated runs are usually done with different initialization, and the 
average is used as the estimated HEP. To assess the performance of the proposed ANN the Square 
Error  (SE)  is  calculated for  each  instance.  According  to  SE  value,  the  Mean  Square  Error (MSE) is 
calculated to evaluate the fitness of the ANN function. The MSE is equal to 5.24E-04 for Table1. 

To make it clearer, the HEP and Estimated HEP are illustrated in Fig. 4. As could be seen the difference 
between  HEP  and  Estimated  HEP  is  large  in  some  instances.  To  eliminate  this  tolerance  the  RSM 
should be used to refine the PSFs and select the most effective PSFs.

Fig. 4. The original HEP vs. HEP proposed By ANN. 

In RSM, we have eight factors and the full RSM requires 282 runs with 10 center points. To reduce the 
run number we use the "Min Run Res V" method. In this method the number of runs is equal to 60 and 
the number of the center points is 6. Table 4 shows the RSM design for 8 PSFs, the reliability (1-HEP) for 
each design has been calculated by ANN.

The above designs have been investigated by RSM, and a quadratic model has been selected to use for the 
fitting process. The result of the ANOVA test is shown in Table 5. According to Table 5, the Model F-value 
of 4.65 implies the model is significant. There is only a 0.01% chance that a "Model F-Value" this large 
could occur due to noise. Also, the "Lack of Fit F-value" of 0.38 implies the "Lack of Fit" is not significant 
relative to the pure error. There is a 96.30% chance that a "Lack of Fit F-value" this large could occur due 
to noise.

To illustrate the robustness of the proposed equation by RSM the original reliability and the predicted 
reliability are shown in Fig. 5. The proposed graph indicates that the RSM equation effectively predicts the 
reliability value for each design.

Fig. 5. The original reliability and the predicted reliability. 

Other graphs such as residual normal plot, and residual vs. predicted are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6.a shows 
that all points fall on the line and the framework fits the data well. For a well-fitted model, the residuals 
plotted  with  respect  to  predicted  values  should  not  follow  any  particular  pattern  and  should  be 
symmetrically distributed with respect to the center line, Fig. 6b follows these rules and indicates that the 
framework is well fitted.

It is understood from the obtained results that the fourth PSF (Procedures) is not effective in reliability (1-
HEP)  and  we  can  eliminate  this  PSF  to  increase  the  accuracy  of  the  ANN.  The  RSM  can  assess  the 
importance of each PSF and the ANN calculates the HEP considering the PSFs dependency. In the next 
step, the ANN is utilized again to estimate the HEP for the proposed instances in Table 1. The "procedure" 
is  eliminated  from  non-effective  PSF  and  the  proposed  ANN  is  run  with  7  PSFs  as  Inputs.  Other 
parameters of ANN do not change. The provided results are shown in Table 6.

The SE-After RSM value indicates that the accuracy of proposed ANN increases in cooperation with RSM. 
The decreases in the SE are shown in Fig. 7. The tolerance between original HEP and predicted HEP has 
decreased in comparison with ANN without RSM.

4 | Conclusion 

HRA is an important issue in production systems and some methods should be proposed to evaluate 
the  reliability  of  humans  in  these  systems.  All  HRA  methods  proposed  some  Performance  Shaping 
Factors  (PSF)  and  calculate  the  HEP  base  on  these  factors.  Selecting  the  most  effective  PSFs  and 
considering the PSFs dependency is an important problem that decreases the time and cost and increases 
the HRA accuracy. In this paper, we proposed an ANN based Human Reliability Analysis (ANNHRA) 
in cooperation with RSM, with ANN we can calculate the HEP considering the PSFs dependency and 
using RSM we can find the most effective PSFs. This framework can provide more accurate HEP with 
lower  time  and  cost. The  performance  of  the  proposed  framework  was  examined  and  the  provided 
results indicated the model can obtain efficient and effective HEP and reliability value in production 
systems.
