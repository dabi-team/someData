Abstract 

Wayne State University's Dan Zowada Memorial Observatory is a fully robotic 0.5m telescope and imaging system located 

under the dark skies of New Mexico.  The observatory is particularly suited to time domain astronomy: the observation of 
variable objects, such as tidal disruption events, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei.  We have developed a software suite 
for image reduction, alignment and stacking, and calculation of absolute photometry in the Sloan filters used at the telescope.  
Our pipeline also performs image subtraction to enable photometry of objects embedded in bright backgrounds such as 
galaxies.  The 5 sigma detection limit of the Zowada Observatory for integration of 16 x 90 second exposures is 19.0 
magnitude in g-band, 18.1 magnitude in r-band, 17.9 magnitude in i-band, and 16.6 magnitude in z-band.  For a 3 sigma 
detection limit, measurements may be performed with greater uncertainties as deep as 19.9, 19.1. 18.9 and 17.5 magnitude in 
griz bands, respectively.

1. Introduction 

Wayne  State  University's  Dan  Zowada  Memorial 
Observatory, hereafter Zowada, is located in the high desert 
of  the  southwest  corner  of  New  Mexico  and  close  to  the 
border of Arizona, just outside the settlement of Rodeo, 2019 
population  of  108  (U.S.  Census  Bureau  2021).   Rodeo 
(31°50′13″N,  109°01′54″W)  is  located  about  80  miles  due 
east of Tombstone, Arizona and about 160 miles due east of 
Kitt Peak Observatory. Zowada’s location provides excellent 
dark sky viewing and generally stable weather conditions.   

Zowada  is  ideal  for  time  domain  astronomy.    We  use 
Zowada  to  research  tidal  disruption  events  (TDEs)  and 
follow  up  on  transients  identified  by  the  Dark  Energy 

Instrument 

Spectroscopic 
(DESI).   We  also  perform 
reverberation mapping of active galactic nuclei (AGN).  Our 
advanced  undergraduate  astronomy  majors  employ  Zowada 
in their Astronomical Techniques Laboratory.  

This  paper  describes 

the  methods,  capabilities,  and 
limitations  of  Zowada.    The  paper  is  arranged  as  follows.  
Section 2 describes the system and optical path and Section 3 
characterizes  the  observatory  site  and  pointing  accuracy. 
Section 4 discusses implementation of our image processing 
pipeline.    Section  5  provides  analysis  of  performance  of 
Zowada.    Finally,  Section  6  discusses  considerations  for 
researchers employing the Zowada Observatory.

respectively.  Transmission  efficiencies  of  the  Sloan  filters 
are  95%  in  u,  98%  in  g,  and  99%  or  better  in  r,  i  and  z 
wavelength ranges.  The wheel also includes Hα, luminance, 
and RGB filters for astrophotography. 

Observations at Zowada currently focus upon g, r, i and z 
filters as this is where the net efficiency of the optical path is 
the best.  Imaging in u-filter is inefficient and difficult at 
magnitudes fainter than about 10.  Zowada u-filter 
observations will generally not be discussed further.   

3. Characterization  

3.1 Pointing Accuracy 

The telescope is mounted on a Paramount ME II managed 
by  Software  Bisque  software,  with  coordinates  entered  by 
users  via  the  DC3  Dreams  ACP  web  form-based  interface. 
Pointing  accuracy  is  potentially  important  to  ensuring  that 
for 
the  appropriate 
photometry. 

imaged  and 

identified 

target 

is 

 Pointing error is assessed by comparing input coordinates 
of  the  target  object  to  the  coordinates  of  the  same  object’s 
centroid  in  the  science  image.    Sources  of  pointing  error 
include  user  coordinate  rounding,  mount  errors  and  object 
proper motion.   

RMS pointing error is 1.44 arc seconds in RA and 1.22 arc 
seconds  in  DEC.    The  pointing  errors  are  consistent  and 
biased  in  one  direction:  target  coordinates  in  the  image  are 
generally greater than input coordinates in RA and DEC, as 
shown  in  Figure  1.    These  pointing  errors  compare  to  the 
pixel  scale  of  0.9  arc  second  per  pixel,  corresponding  to 
roughly  1-1/2  pixels.    Pointing  errors  are  well  within  the 
typical  point  spread  distribution  of  target  objects.    Pointing 
errors  do  not  affect  operation  of  the  photometry  pipeline, 
which identifies image and catalog objects within a radius of 
2.0 arc seconds, or 2.2 pixels. 

We have not assessed mount tracking accuracy during 
exposures. We rarely employ exposures greater than 300 
seconds and have had no noticeable tracking problems for 
exposures of 300 seconds or less. 

2. System and Optical Path 

Zowada is a fully robotic observatory.  The DC3 Dreams 
ACP  web  form-based  interface  is  used  for  observatory 
scheduling.  Users program the observatory for observations 
and  receive 
internet.   Three  onsite 
computers manage observatory operations.   

image  data  over 

Zowada is housed within a 12.5 foot motorized clamshell 

dome.   We use a Davis Instruments Vantage Pro2 weather 
station to measure wind speed, temperature and pressure, and 
a Boltwood Cloud Sensor II to measure sky temperature to 
determine the level of cloud cover: these support weather 
safe operations and automated closure of the observatory 
dome to protect against rain and wind events.  We use an 
SBIG All-Sky 340 camera to observe and document sky 
conditions every five minutes day and night.  During a 
summer 2019 upgrade, we added a windbreak to reduce wind 
driven vibrations to allow for operations during higher winds 
and a backup diesel generator to reduce downtime and 
equipment risk during power interruptions. 

The telescope is a 0.51m (20 inch) corrected Dall-Kirkham 

telescope manufactured by PlaneWave Instruments, of 
Adrian, Michigan.  The telescope has a focal length of 
3454mm and focal ratio of f/6.8.  The telescope is mounted 
on a Paramount ME II managed by Software Bisque 
software.  Focusing is driven by the Maxim DL software.  
The camera is a Finger Lakes Instruments ProLine 23042 BB 
with E2V CCD230-42 sensor. The back-illuminated CCD is 
2048 x 2048 pixels, with a physical pixel size of 15 
micrometers by 15 micrometers.  The pixel scale is 0.9 arc 
second per pixel.  The field of view is approximately 30 arc 
minutes x 30 arc minutes.  The wavelength range of the 
camera is 2600 Å – 10,000 Å.  Quantum efficiency is better 
than 85% from 4600 Å - 5600 Å and exceeds 70% from 
4000 Å - 7400 Å; quantum efficiency drops rapidly outside 
those bounds.    
A 10-position filter wheel is mounted between the telescope 
and the camera.  The  wheel includes  Astrodon  Gen 2  Sloan 
u'  g'  r'  i'  and  Pan-STARRS  zs  filters  (hereafter  ugriz)  to 
support  scientific  observations.   The  wavelength  centers  are 
at  3540  Å,  4770  Å,  6215  Å,  7545  Å  and  8700  Å,

Figure 1.  Scattergram of Zowada pointing errors and histograms of errors in RA and DEC.  RMS tracking errors of 1.4 arc 
seconds in RA and 1.22 arc seconds in DEC compare to the pixel scale of 0.9 arc second per pixel of the camera.  The 
pointing error is well within the point spread of target objects.  

3.2 Observing Conditions 

Zowada’s  location  in  the  high  desert  provides  excellent 
dark  sky  viewing  and  generally  stable  weather  conditions.  
We  performed  observations  during  88%  of  the  available 
nights excluding summer shutdown, when Zowada is closed 
for  monsoon  season.    The  average  night  included  5.0  hours 
of observations.  

To  assess  variability  of  seeing  as  measured  by  FWHM  at 
Zowada,  we  reviewed  observations  over  the  period  January 
16, 2019-June 15, 2020, from installation of the Finger Lakes 
camera  to  the  2020  summer  shutdown.    Observations  were 
sampled  at  30  minute  intervals  to  avoid  over-sampling  of 
short  and  repeated  exposures.    Over  the  18  month  period, 
FWHM ranged from 1.2 to 9.0 arc seconds.

Figure 2.  Effect of the wall around the Zowada Observatory.  After construction of the wall, mean FWHM increased while 
the range of FWHM experienced decreased.  FWHM is compared for January 16 - June 15, 2019 and January 16 - June 15, 
2020.   

During  summer  shutdown  in  2019,  we  installed  a  wall 
around  the  Zowada  Observatory  to  reduce  the  number  of 
clear  nights  lost  to  gusts  by  increasing  the  threshold  wind 
gust  speed  considered  safe  for  viewing.    We  evaluate  the 
effect  of  the  wall  upon  FWHM  and  observation  time  by 
comparing the period before construction of the wall in 2019, 
from  January  16  to  June  15,  2019,  to  the  same  period  after 
construction  of  the  wall  in  2020.   Figure  2  shows  the  mean 
FWHM  increased  from  3.22  to  3.61  arc  seconds  in  g-band, 
while  the  standard  deviation  of  the  FWHM  distribution 
decreased  from  1.13  to  0.71  arc  seconds.    The  wall  has 
reduced observations at both low and high FWHM; Zowada 
now experiences no observations with FWHM less than 2 arc 
seconds  and  fewer  observations  with  FWHM  worse  than  6 
arc seconds.  The increase in mean FWHM since installation 
of  the  wall  may  be  due  to  increased  turbulence  above  the 
dome due to airflow over the wall.  

The  wall  accomplished 

increasing 
observatory time.  There were about 11% more observations 

its  purpose  of 

in  2020  compared  to  the  same  period  before  installation  of 
the  wall  in  2019.    Increased  observation  count  reflected 
increased  operating  schedules  due  to  improved  weather 
protection. 
  Different  weather  conditions  or  observing 
schedules might also have contributed.   

Our  measurements  for  the  remainder  of  this  article 
evaluate  FWHM  since  the  installation  of  the  wall.    Our 
measurements of mean FWHM are 3.61, 3.46, 3.31 and 3.14 
arc  seconds  in  g,  r,  i,  and  z-bands,  respectively.    Seeing 
appears  to  weakly  improve  with  wavelength  as  expected 
from theory (Coulman 1985).   FWHM can show significant 
variability within a week or even a day.  We have not found 
to  ambient 
minimum/”best”  FWHM 
temperature or to occur at a consistent time of night.

4. Image Processing Pipeline  

4.1 Introduction 

The  dome,  telescope  mount,  filter  wheel  and  camera  at 
Zowada  are  fully  robotic.    Users  enter  objects  for  imaging 
through  the  DC3  ACP  web-form  interface.   Objects  are 
automatically  scheduled  for  observation,  prioritized  based 
upon  user  entered  priority  weighting,  monitoring  interval, 
object altitude, and available observatory time.  Exposures of 
acquired images typically range between 30  - 300 seconds.

the  acquired  raw 

link  relays 

images 

We  developed  a  series  of  software  modules  in  Python  to 
perform  image  processing  and  analysis.    The  pipeline 
employs 
(Astropy 
Collaboration  et  al.  2013;  Astropy  Collaboration  et  al.  2018) 
and  Photutils  (Bradley  et  al.  2020)  and  ideas  and  structure 
from OKeeffe (2017).  

various  modules 

from  Astropy 

We perform image reduction upon raw science frames in 

the usual way to produce bias and dark subtracted, flat-
fielded images.  Our image reduction uses the most recent 
available calibration frames: weather conditions permitting, 
calibration frames are taken in the morning at the conclusion 
of the nightly observing session which produced the science 
image.  Upon completion image reduction, we align and 
stack the science frames to improve signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) of the final science frames.  

Relative or absolute photometry are performed upon the 
resulting images.  If we are studying an object located on a 
bright background, we first perform subtraction to isolate the 
object.  Image subtraction removes the surrounding 
background to allow photometry on the object of interest.  
This is useful for study of objects such as TDEs within a 
galactic bulge 

4.2 Relative Photometry 

We perform relative photometry to determine the relative 
flux  of  a  variable  object  and  to  construct  light  curves  of 
objects  that  have  been  observed  over  several  epochs.  
Relative  photometry  works  by  comparing  the  count  rate  of 
the  variable  object  of  interest  with  the  count  rates  of  non-
variable  comparison  stars  in  the  same  field  of  view.    We 
determine  count  rates  using  simple  aperture  photometry  on 
bias  and  dark  subtracted,  flat-fielded 
  The 
comparison stars are assumed not to vary from one epoch of 
observations  to  another,  and  so  a  scale-factor  is  calculated 
for  each  epoch  so  that  the  sum  of  the  count  rates  from  the 
comparison stars remains constant.  The scale factors account 
for  changes  in  the  count  rate  due  to  changes  in  seeing 
between  epochs.    We  apply  these  scale  factors  to  the  count 
rate  of  the  target  of  interest  to  determine  the  target’s  light 
curve.  To set the absolute flux scale, the  magnitudes of the 
comparison stars can be obtained from appropriate catalogs. 

images.

The Zowada Observatory has been performing near daily 
monitoring  of  AGN 
to  perform  continuum 
in  order 
reverberation  mapping,  where  time  lags  are  determined 
between the AGN light curves at different  wavelengths (see 
Cackett, et al (2021) for a review of reverberation mapping).  
The AGN that have been monitored are relatively nearby and 
bright Seyfert 1s, which have B-band magnitudes typically in 
the  14  to  15  magnitude  range. 
  We  usually  obtain 
observations  in  all  the  ugriz  bands  in  pairs  of  300  second 
exposures in g, r and i bands and in three or four exposures 
in the less-sensitive u and z bands.  With these exposures at 
these  magnitudes,  it  is  normally  the  case  that  the  standard 
deviation  in  the  comparison  star  light  curves  is  the  larger 
source  of  uncertainty  over  the  statistical  uncertainty  in  the 
count  rates.  This  limits  the  photometric  accuracy  to  around 
1%  in  g,  r,  and  i  bands  and  2-3%  in  u  and  z  bands.    The 
typical variability amplitude of AGN is several times this in 
u,  g,  r,  and  i  bands.    However,  AGN  are  less  variable  at 
longer optical wavelengths, and in the z band the variability 
amplitude  can 
the  photometric 
sometimes  approach 
uncertainty,  making  time  lag  measurements  in  that  band 
more challenging. 

A more detailed description of the application of relative 
photometry  to  the  Zowada  Observatory  monitoring  data  of 
AGN, along with example light curves, is given in Cackett et 
al. (2020).  Figure 3 provides a g-band light curve for AGN 
Mrk  142  adapted  from  this  source.    Other  examples  of 
Zowada Observatory data used for reverberation mapping are 
Kara et al. (2021) and Vincentelli et al. (2021). 

4.3 Absolute Photometry 

We  perform absolute photometry upon  a target object  by 
comparing  the  target  image’s  instrumental  flux  to  a  sample 
of  reference  objects.    The  photometry  module  calculates  a 
linear relation of instrumental flux to magnitude based upon 
the reference objects.  The magnitude of the target object is 
calculated based upon this equation and its instrumental flux.     

the  median  background 

We  employ  aperture  photometry 

to  obtain  our 
instrumental fluxes.  Circular apertures are used based upon 
FWHM  of  the  science  image.    Target  object  flux  is 
calculated based upon the flux in the circular aperture, after 
subtraction  of 
flux  of  a 
corresponding  area  of  a  surrounding  annulus.    The  aperture 
radius  is  typically  taken  at  2.0  times  the  FWHM.    At  the 
mean FWHM  in  g-band of 3.61 arc seconds,  mean aperture 
radius  in  r-band  is  7.22  arc  seconds,  the  inner  radius  of  the 
annulus is 10.83 arc seconds and the outer radius is 14.44 arc 
seconds.  We subtract median rather than mean instrumental 
flux  measured  in  the  background  annulus  because  this  has

annulus.   Alternative apertures and annuli  were investigated 
but found to provide equivalent measurements.   

To  construct  the  line  for  calculation  of  the  magnitude  of 
the  target object, the photometry  module builds a sample of 
nearby  (typically  within  0.2  -  0.4  degrees)  comparison 
objects  of  similar  accepted  measurements  of  luminosity 
(typically  +/-  1.0  or  1.5  magnitudes)  to  the  target  object.  
Accepted  magnitudes  for  comparison  objects  are  stipulated 
to  correspond  to  measurements  by  Zowada  of  instrumental 
flux  for  these  objects.    The  photometry  module  filters  the 
comparison objects for like objects, i.e. stars are compared to 
stars  and  galaxies  to  galaxies,  and  eliminates  objects  of 
insufficient  photometric  quality.    We  perform  additional 
filtering  of  comparison  objects  to  exclude  objects  not 
suitable  for  photometry;  these  "outliers"  most  often  include 
objects  with  point  spread  functions  (PSFs)  that  overlap 
within  the  0.9  arc  second  per  pixel  scale  of  the  Zowada 
camera.    The  photometry  module  excludes  a  comparison 
object  if  the  magnitude  that  would  be  calculated  for  the 
object  based  upon  its  instrumental  flux  is  more  than  three 
standard  deviations  greater  than  or  less  than  its  accepted 
catalog  value.    We  have  not  calculated  extinction  or  color 
transformation  coefficients  and  are  not  planning  to  do  so.  
Our  frame  by  frame  calibration  method  works  better  where 
we have sufficient number of calibration stars in the science 
image.  For a given measurement, the sample size of nearby 
comparison  reference  objects  ranges  from  about  a  dozen  at 
13 magnitude to over a hundred at 16 magnitude.   Figure 4 
illustrates the construction of the best fit line for calculation 
of  magnitude  of  sn2020uyn;  a  sample  of  APASS  accepted 
magnitudes  and  Zowada  measurements  of  instrumental  flux 
for 248 nearby stars was used to set the line.. 

Comparison  reference  objects  are  taken,  when  possible, 
from  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS)  Catalog,  Data 
Release 12 (Alam 2015).  Our pipeline accesses this catalog 
through  Vizier  (Ochsenbein  et  al  2000;  Ochsenbein  2015)\ 
using  Astroquery  (Ginsburg  et  al.  2019).    SDSS  is  the 
database  employed  by  our  primary  research  partners  and 
provides  the  ability  to  compare  observations  taken  with 
Zowada's ugriz filter set against accepted catalog values over 
a  wide  range  of  magnitudes.   The  SDSS  catalog  includes 
objects  fainter  than  roughly  magnitude  9  over  much  of  the 
Northern  sky.    Detailed  information  is  available  regarding 
object  type  and  numerous  specific  photometric  "flags", 
which  provide  detailed  information  on  the  quality  and 
limitations of the underlying  photometry.  Our pipeline  uses 
these flags to filter reference objects for “clean” photometry 
and exclude objects whose flags indicate saturation, blended 
objects,  or  various  issues  with  the  observed  PSF.   Filtering 
upon  the  photometry  flags  including  saturation  excludes 
objects brighter than 15 magnitude and about 20 - 35% of the 
remaining  fainter  objects,  while  significantly  improving  the 
standard deviation around measured magnitudes.  Drawbacks 
of the SDSS catalog are that its sky coverage is limited and 
“clean” photometry is available only for objects fainter than 
15 magnitude.  

When we need to perform photometry in areas of the  sky 
not covered by  the  SDSS catalog,  we take  reference objects 

from  the  American  Association  of  Variable  Sky  Observers 
(AAVSO)  Photometric  All-Sky  Survey  (APASS),  Data 
Release  10  (Henden  et  al.  2018).   The  APASS  catalog 
includes  objects  from  about  7  -  17  magnitude  in  the  ugriz 
filter  set.   This  catalog  covers  a  complementary  fraction  of 
the sky and provides magnitudes for brighter objects than the 
SDSS catalog.  The  APASS  catalog is  published to provide 
standards  for  the  measurement  of  variable  objects  and  is 
constructed  to  only  retain  objects  sufficiently  constant  in 
flux.  However,  it  does  not  provide  the  detailed  photometric 
data  of  the  SDSS  catalog.    Between  them,  the  SDSS  and 
APASS  catalogs  cover  much  of  the  sky  visible  to  the 
Zowada Observatory.   

4.4 Image Subtraction 

We  include  an  image  subtraction  module  in  our  pipeline 
to enable us to measure objects that are positioned against a 
luminous background.  This image subtraction begins with a 
reduced Zowada image that contains a transient and removes 
the host galaxy, leaving only the transient. This allows us to 
measure  absolute  photometry  and  construct  light  curves  for 
objects  such  as  supernovae  and  TDEs,  which  may  be 
otherwise obscured by their host galaxy.  

The  image  subtraction  module  is  performed  upon  science 
images  generated  from  the  reduction  and  stacking  of  raw 
files,  as  discussed  above.    The  first  step  of  the  image 
subtraction  module  is  to  build  a  template  of  the  field  for 
subtraction.    We  download  template  images  using  the 
panstamps  (Andika  et  al.  2020)  software.    This  Python 
software  gathers  images  of  a  requested  field  from  the  Pan-
STARRS  (Magnier  et  al.  2013)  archive,  in  the  requested 
filters.    These  template  images  are  aligned  to  the  science 
images  from  the  Zowada  Observatory  using  the  reproject 
(Robitaille et al. 2020) Python module.  This module rotates 
the template and resamples the Pan-STARRS image to be the 
same  as the Zowada image.  Once aligned,  masks are  made 
for  both  the  Zowada  image  and  the  template.  These  masks 
account for hot and dead pixels, and edge artifacts that arise 
from  shrinking  and  rotating 
larger  Pan-STARRS 
templates.  

the 

Before  we  can  subtract  the  aligned  template  from  the 
science image,  we  must first  match the PSF and the scaling 
of  the  two  images.  This  is  done  using  the  High  Order 
Transform  of  PSF  and  Template  Subtraction  (HOTPANTS) 
(Becker  2015).    We  first  measure  the  PSF  of  both  images 
using the Astromatic package PSFEx (Bertin 2011). Then we 
provide HOTPANTS with some basic information to allow it 
to  transform  the  template  to  match  the  science  image.  This 
information  includes  the  masks  and  the  size  and  number  of 
the Gaussians of the PSFs used to smear the template image.  
The  width  of  the  Gaussian  in  the  kernel  is  calculated  as 
2 
suggested by the HOTPANTS documentation by σm = sqrt(σt
2).    Here  σm  is  the  size  of  the  central  Gaussian  used  by 
+  σs
HOTPANTS, and σt and σs  represent the size of the PSF for 
the  template  and  science  images  respectively,  as  calculated 
by  PSFEx.    If  there  is  a  transient  that  is  above  Zowada 
detection  limits,  then  HOTPANTS  will  return  a  blank  field

in  Figure  5:  this  is  the  transient  under  study.    There  are 
generally some artifacts from subtraction, but there is rarely 
any ambiguity in detecting the transient itself.  We can also 
use  the  Astromatic  package  SExtractor  (Bertin  2011)  to 
confirm the detection of a transient. 

Once  the  subtracted  image  is  generated,  we  then  take  a 
160x160 pixel cutout around  the  source  from the subtracted 

image.    This  cutout  is  inserted  into  the  same  region  of  the 
reduced and stacked Zowada image.  This allows us to place 
the isolated source back in its original field to have a proper 
comparison

photometry upon the transient in the final image as described 
previously.  Light curves are constructed from time series of 
the  photometric  data,  with  an  example  shown  in  Figure  6.

5. Data Analysis   

5.1  Magnitude Measurements 

We may perform standalone measurements of an object's 
luminosity or, more often, compile these measurements over 
time  to  build  a  light  curve  for  an  object  of  varying  flux.  
Current research at the Zowada Observatory relies upon light 
curves, including observations of TDEs and AGN. 

We  assess  Zowada’s  capability  for  measurement  by 
comparison  with  SDSS  catalog  measurements  and  by  its 
limiting  magnitude.    Accuracy  of  measurements  is  assessed 
by  comparison  of  Zowada  measurements  to  SDSS  catalog 
measurements because the photometry module measures the 
magnitude of an object within a science image by comparing 
its  luminosity  with  nearby  objects  drawn  from  the  SDSS 
catalog.  

Our magnitude measurements at the Zowada Observatory 
track closely to those in the SDSS catalog over a wide range 
of  magnitudes  and  objects,  as  shown  by  measurement  of 
magnitudes 
in  Figure  7.  
Measurements performed with longer integration time of 16 

for  353  stars 

in  g-band 

x  90  second  exposures  (1440  seconds)  have  smaller  errors 
compared to the SDSS catalog and a smaller spread of errors 
than  do  measurements  performed  with  shorter  integration 
times of generally 4 x 60 or 4 x 90 second exposures (240  - 
360 seconds).  Results are similar in r, i, and z bands.  Errors 
for  measurements  of  objects  indicated  by  SDSS  as  having 
clean photometry were lower at low magnitudes than at high 
magnitudes,  as  expected.    SDSS  photometry  at  13-14 
magnitude is flagged as saturated and potentially unreliable; 
we believe this leads to  higher  magnitude  measurements  by 
SDSS than Zowada for these brighter objects. 

RMS errors for Zowada measurements compared to SDSS 
catalog are less than 0.2 magnitude through 18.5 magnitude 
in g and r bands, 18.3 magnitude in i-band, and 16.5 
magnitude in z-band.  Measurement in z band is more 
challenging because of the lower net optical path efficiency.  
Errors tend to increase with increasing magnitudes and with i 
and z bands compared to r and g bands.  As expected, 
Zowada is able to measure deeper magnitudes for longer 
integration times, while the distribution of errors widens for 
higher magnitudes and narrow for longer integration times. 

Figure 7.  Magnitude measurements in g-band at Zowada compared to SDSS for 353 measured stars.  Errors tend to increase 
with increasing magnitude and with i and z  bands compared to r and g bands.  Short integration times are generally 4 x 60 
seconds or 4 x 90 seconds; long integration times are  16 x 90 seconds.   SDSS photometry  at ~14  magnitude  is  flagged as 
saturated.

5.2 Limiting Magnitude for Zowada Observations 

References 

Five-sigma limiting magnitude is evaluated based upon the 
noise  level  of  science  images.    The  magnitude  is  measured 
that  corresponds  to  five  times  the  noise  level  of  the  image 
background.    For  individual  90  second  exposures,  the  5-
sigma detection limit is 17.6 magnitude in g, 16.7 magnitude 
in  r,  16.5  in  i  and  15.2  in  z  band;  for  16  x  90  second 
exposures  these  are  19.0,  18.1,  17.9  and  16.6  magnitude  in 
griz bands, respectively.   

Magnitudes may be measured with useful accuracy beyond 
the 5-sigma limiting magnitude.  We assess a practical limit 
to magnitude  measurements to be reached at that magnitude 
corresponding to the peak count of objects setting the best fit 
line.    Beyond  this  magnitude,  few  additional  stars  may  be 
resolved  to  build  the  regression  line  and  the  number  of 
objects  setting  the  best  fit  line  begins  to  decrease.    This  is 
similar  to  one  of  the  methods  employed  by  the  Canadian 
Astronomy Data Center for assessment of limiting magnitude 
in  their  MegaPipe  image  stacking  pipeline  (Canadian 
Astronomy Data Centre 2020).   For Zowada, this practical 
limit is consistent with the 3-sigma limiting value magnitude. 
We find that the 3-sigma limit to observations for individual 
90 second exposures is 18.2 magnitude in g, 17.2 magnitude 
in  r,  17.1  magnitude  in  i  and  15.7  in  z-band.    The  3-sigma 
limit to observations of longer integrations times of 16 x 90 
second exposures are 19.5, 18.6, 18.4 and 17.1 magnitude in 
griz  bands, 
to  higher 
magnitudes are possible with increased uncertainties.

6. Discussion 

We  have  shown  that  the  Zowada  Observatory  provides 
relatively  short  exposures.  
accurate  measurements  at 
Accuracy  compared  to  SDSS  measurements  improves  for 
longer integration times.   For integration of 16  x 90 second 
exposures, 
limit  of  Zowada 
Observatory  is  19.0  magnitude  in  g,  18.1  magnitude  in  r, 
17.9  magnitude  in  i,  and  16.6  magnitude  in  z.    For  a  three 
sigma detection limit, measurements may be performed with 
greater  uncertainties  as  deep  as  19.5,  18.6.  18.4  and  17.1 
magnitude in griz bands, respectively.

 Zowada's  capacity  to  perform  measurements  in  multiple 
optical  wavelengths  expands  the  data  available  to  Wayne 
State University's research and partnerships.  Measurements 
and  light  curves  in  griz  wavelengths  provides  valuable 
optical  wavelength  data  to  complement  x-ray  and  radio  and 
other  observations.    The  Zowada  Observatory  can  also 
provide  measurements  for  targets  of  opportunity  with  daily 
or near daily cadence.
