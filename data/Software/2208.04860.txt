ABSTRACT  

Vehicle-to-Everything  communications  (V2X)  are  becoming  increasingly  popular  as  a  solution  for  safer 
roads and better traffic management. One of the essential protocols in V2X is the Dedicated Short Range 
Communication  (DSRC)  protocol  suite.  DSRC  includes  the  IEEE  802.11p  protocol  that  operates  at  the 
medium  access control  (MAC)  and physical  (PHY)  layers. Upon  collision,  the  IEEE 802.11p  MAC layer 
applies a carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism that randomly selects a 
backoff  time  to  re-check  the  channel  activity  and  then  retransmit.  However,  the  random  selection  of  the 
backoff  time  may  lead  to  further  packet  collisions  that  decrease  the  utilization  of  the  communication 
channel, which suffers from a limited bandwidth in the first place. This paper proposes a fuzzy model based 
on rational decision-making, which we call F-802.11p, to improve the IEEE 802.11p protocol backoff time 
selection  by  limiting  the  IEEE  802.11p  beacon  messages  to  better  use  of  the  available  bandwidth.  A 
simulation  study  presents  the  evaluation  of  our  work  compared  to  IEEE  802.11p.  We  deployed  the 
simulation software in two scenarios: the Veins Framework map and the map of New Administrative Cairo 
in  Egypt.  We base  our  comparison  on  slots  backoff,  times  into  backoff,  PHY  busy  time,  MAC  busy  time, 
total  lost  packets,  and  generated/received  beacon  messages.  Simulation  results  show  that  both  protocols 
have comparable  results in  slots  backoff,  times  into  back  off,  and  the  generated  beacon  messages. At the 
same time, our F-802.11p significantly outperforms the IEEE 802.11p in PHY busy time, MAC busy time, 
total lost packets, and the received beacon messages in both scenarios.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

the 

Intelligent  Transportation  System 

Vehicle-to-Everything communications (V2X) can be supported by either the 3GPP LTE, cellular 
V2X (C-V2X), or the IEEE 802.11p access layer. Based on the IEEE 802.11p, two standards are 
used to support V2X: the  dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) developed  by the  U.S. 
and 
the  European 
Telecommunications  Standards  Institute  (ETSI).  Our focus  in  this  work  is  on  DSRC.  DSRC  is 
designed  to  provide  vehicle-to-vehicle  (V2V)  and  vehicle-to-infrastructure  (V2I)  direct 
communications [22]. DSRC employs Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) that 
contains  the  IEEE  1609  family,  which  includes  IEEE  1609.4  for  multichannel  operations,  and 
IEEE  802.11p,  which  operates  at  the  media  access  control  (MAC)  and  physical  (PHY)  layers. 
IEEE  1609.4  divides  the  allocated  spectrum  into  six  service  channels  (SCH)  and  one  control 

(ITS)-G5  developed  by

channel (CCH). Furthermore, it divides channel time access into 50  ms CCH interval and 50 ms 
SCH interval as sequential synchronous intervals [8, 12]. On the other hand, IEEE 802.11p MAC 
depends on the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mechanism that allows vehicles to 
access  the  channel  based  on  a  Distribution  Coordination  Function  (DCF).  In  this  scheme,  a 
vehicle senses the channel before transmitting, and if the channel is idle for the arbitration inter-
frame space (AIFS) period, it accesses the channel  directly. Otherwise, a carrier sense  multiple 
access/collision  avoidance  (CSMA/CA)  MAC  protocol  is  enabled  in  which  a  backoff  time  is 
randomly selected from the  interval [0, W],  where  W is the  current  vehicle  contention  window 
(C.W.).  Initially,  C.W.  is  set  to  its  minimum  value  (CWmin)  and  doubles  on  sequent  collisions 
until a maximum contention  window CWmax  is reached. The selection of the CWmin and CWmax 
values  depends  on  the  application  type,  which  includes  best-effort  traffic  (B.E.),  background 
traffic (B.K.), video traffic (VI), and voice traffic (V.O.) [33].  

Communications in DSRC encompass many  message  types that include  regular DSRC packets, 
WAVE  Short  messages  (WSMs),  Basic  Safety  Messages  (BSMs),  and  WAVE  Service 
Advertisement  messages  (WSAs).  WSMs,  also  known  as  beacons,  are  broadcast  messages  sent 
periodically at a rate of 2-10 Hz by a vehicle to its neighbors to inform the current state. BSMs 
are used to communicate special and dangerous traffic situations such as intersection collisions or 
roadside  alerts.  WSAs  convey  information  about  services  such  as  traffic  alerts,  tolling, 
navigation,  restaurant  information,  entertainment,  and  Internet  access.  The  number  of  WSM, 
BSM,  and  WSA  messages  is  directly  proportional  to  vehicle  density.  If  a  channel  is  busy, 
collisions are potentially arising. Consequently, in a high dense network and limited bandwidth, 
message  reliability  and  latency  constraints  may  not  be reached  [1,  5,  9,  11]  [14  -  15]  [17  -  18] 
[37]. 

Typically,  vehicle  density  exhibits  uneven  distribution  and  is  dynamic.  Vehicles  may  be 
condensed in a small area, causing high interference, or may form a sparse network  in that each 
vehicle  is  out  of  range  of  the  others.  The  dynamic  nature  of  vehicles'  movements  makes  it 
difficult  to  determine  their  precise  speeds,  signal  strengths,  and  distances  in  real-time, 
complicating  building  accurate  topology  control  platforms  [2-3].  IEEE  802.11p  MAC  applies 
CSMA/CA, where the C.W. selection  does not adapt to V2X  dynamicity. As a result, a vehicle 
may wait for a long time due to a busy channel state. Even worse, a vehicle in a transmitted mode 
may have collided packets, doubling its C.W. During these long waiting times, a vehicle cannot 
send BSM to declare an accident and cannot send warning messages.  

This  paper  aims  to  enhance  the  IEEE  802.11p  MAC  and  PHY  layers  by  exploiting  the 
uncertainty  in  V2X  to  self-adapt  to  the  different  conditions  to  achieve  the  reliability  and  delay 
requirements for various V2X applications. We propose a fuzzy model, which we call F-802.11p, 
to  decide  on  the  backoff  time  instead  of  selecting  it  randomly  as  implemented  in  the  IEEE 
802.11p.  The  reason  behind  using  fuzzy  logic  has  discussed  in  section  3.  To  evaluate  our 
proposal, we conducted simulation studies that compare F-802.11p against the IEEE 802.11p in 
two  scenarios:  the  Veins  Framework  map  and  the  map  of  New  Administrative  Cairo  in  Egypt. 
Results  from  the  simulation  show  that  both  protocols  have  comparable  results  in  slots  backoff, 
times  into  back  off,  and  the  generated  beacon  messages,  while  F-802.11p  significantly 
outperforms  the  IEEE  802.11p  in  PHY  busy  time,  MAC  busy  time,  total  lost  packets,  and  the 
received beacon messages. The main contribution of this work is summarized as follows:  

-  Proposing  a  fuzzy  model  (F-802.11p)  to  enhance  the  MAC  and  PHY  layers  to  reduce 
generated/received beacon packets in most network conditions to decrease collisions. 
-  Performing  a  simulation-based  validation  using  Simulation  of  Urban  Mobility 
(SUMO)0.30.0,  Veins  5.0,  Objective  Modular  Network  Testbed  in C++  (OMNeT++) 
5.4.1, Open Street Map, and MATLAB 2016b fuzzy toolbox.

-  Analyzing  the  effect  of  the  fuzzy  model  on  backoff  parameters  (C.W.  and  AIFS)  in 

DSRCstandards based on the simulation results.  

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  A  review  of  related  work  is  given  in  Section  2. 
Section 3 introduces our F-802.11p proposal. The simulation environment is presented in Section

2.  RELATED RESEARCH  

Many  researchers  addressed  the  calculation  of  the  contention  window  on  collision,  and  several 
articles have been introduced to replace the IEEE 802.11p random selection of the backoff time. 
Objectives of earlier work in this area fall in the following directions: 

-  Analyze  the  IEEE  802.11p  MAC  layer  to  gain  insights  into  packet  delivery  ratio  and 

backoff duration [13, 33]. 

-  Enhancing  the  protocol  performance  through  improving  random  contention  window 
selection  [20,  22],  channel  access  mechanisms  [38],  throughput  [25],  collision 
probabilities [23], and congestion [16]. 
-  Optimizing the channel access [27] [21]. 
-  Ensuring the delivery of safety messages [7]. 
-  Fairness of the time-slot allocation [35] and solving the unbalanced backoffs times [10].

Such  earlier efforts can be broadly classified  into  historical-based  or data processing based. On 
the  one  hand,  historical  data  techniques,  in  a  broad  context,  are  based  on  collecting  data about 
past events and circumstances of a particular subject. On the other hand, historical-based methods 
can be further divided into probabilistic and  deep learning  models. Probabilistic techniques use 
statistics to examine data. They assume randomness to predict future events based on past ones. 
Deep  learning  (DL),  referred  to  as  features  representation  learning  is  the  relationship  between 
features  using  hierarchal  representation.  Based  on  artificial  machine  learning  (ML),  DL  and 
neural networks (ANNs) are provided with features and some known training examples. 

On the other hand, data processing schemes rely on a real-time collection of data about events or 
actions.  Data  processing-based  techniques  can  be  classified  into  mathematical  and  algorithmic. 
Mathematical models describe a real-world problem in mathematical terms, typically in the form 
of equations. They use these equations to help understand the original problem and discover new

features about the  situation. An algorithm carefully crafts a set of instructions that take specific 
inputs to achieve a particular task. Figure 1 presents a classification of the backoff time selection 
algorithms.  

To  evaluate  their  work,  earlier  efforts  used  simulators  and  numerical  analysis.  Simulations  that 
were  used  include  such  ns-2  [7,  25,  35],  ns-3  [1,  10,  20,  21],  iTETRIS  [16],  OPNET  [23], 
OMNeT++  [27]  along  with  SUMO,  Veins  and  OpenStreetMap.  Numerical  analysis  is  basically 
performed based on MATLAB [13, 38] and the probabilistic PRISM model [33].  

Several  works  adopted  fuzzy  logic  to  enhance  IEEE  802.11p  by  relieving  contention  window 
random size [40–41, 44-49, 51], controlling beacon messages [39, 50, 52-53], and managing the 
MAC layer [42-43]. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous work evaluated 
the  effect  of  a  fuzzy  model  in  IEEE  802.11p  with  V2V  and  V2I  environments  considering 
contention  window random size, controlling beacon  messages,  managing MAC layer, and PHY 
engaged time simultaneously. Table 1  shows a feature-based  comparison between  our proposed 
model with other related works that adopted fuzzy logic.

3.  METHODOLOGY AND PROPOSED MODEL 

This paper proposes F-802.11p, a fuzzy enhancement for the IEEE 802.11p. The IEEE 802.11p 
requires  senders  to  wait  on  packet  collision  for  a  contention  window  (C.W.)  that  is  selected  at 
random. The random selection of the C.W. may not be the best strategy as a small C.W. may lead 
to  further  collisions,  and  a  large  C.W.  may  lead  to  unnecessary  long  waiting  times.  However, 
several  parameters  such  as  speed,  signal-to-noise  ratio,  sender  gain,  receiver  gain,  power  level, 
the  distance  between  vehicles  and  RSU,  and  channel  idle  time  are  studied.  We  conducted  the 
assessment study of these parameters using a k-means clustering algorithm. Our assessment study 
determined  the  most  influential  parameters  like  speed,  sender  gain,  and  receiver  gain. 
Furthermore,  our  F-802.11p  increases  the  vehicle's  channel  idle  time  by  exploiting  the 
uncertainty  of  input  parameters  to  reduce  the  number  of  collided  and  redundant  packets  and 
network  overhead.  More  specifically,  F-802.11p  utilizes  the  vehicle's  speed,  sender's  gain,  and 
receiver's gain  inputs to  enable  vehicles to  decide rationally in sending response/request WSM, 
WSA, and BSM beacon messages.  

With the F-802.11p, and before broadcasting a packet, a vehicle checks its status in terms of three 
parameters:  speed,  gain,  and  the  nearest  vehicle  gain  (receiver)  to  optimize  channel  idle  time. 
Typically, these parameters change at a rate of milliseconds. The vehicle's speed changes because 
of road speed limits, frequent stops due to traffic lights, and environmental hazards. The sending 
and receiving vehicle gain are hard to measure  because of obstacles and signal interference. If a 
vehicle's status matches the fuzzy model linguistic terms, it can broadcast its message. Otherwise, 
the  vehicle  waits.  The  fuzzy  model  creates  an  arrangement  pattern  of  sending  and  receiving 
packets,  and  it  allows  vehicles  with  the  same  status  to  communicate  reliably  and  prevents  the 
vehicles with the undesired status from engaging the channel with redundant packets.

Due to the uncertainty in the three parameters, we use fuzzy logic as a method for representing 
and  processing  the  uncertainty  based  on  "degrees  of  truth"  rather  than  conventional  computing 
with a discrete outcome of "true or false" or "1 or 0" to provide low-cost approximate solutions to 
relieve C.W. randomization. Generally, a fuzzy model deals with imprecise data based on expert 
knowledge to help control unpredictable systems to control accuracy. Here, the proposed model 
deals with a lack of exact knowledge (speed, sender gain, receiver gain) to reach an approximate 
reasoning decision to achieve better vehicle channel consumption.  

Each  transmitted  message  contains  a  set  of  attributes  such  as  sender  gain,  receiver  gain,  and 
speed.  Grouping,  feature  selection,  forming,  and  cleaning  these  attributes'  values  to  make  a 
dataset have been made according to [6]. The dataset shows a relationship between the vehicle's 
speed, sender gain, receiver gain, and channel idle time. Also, the  fuzzy model knowledge base 
(IF…THEN…rules) is based on this dataset. The knowledge base is based on expert knowledge 
that a domain expert or fuzzy clustering could obtain. The collected dataset is clustered by fuzzy 
clustering to extract the knowledge base in this work. 

Our performance metrics include the following: 

  Slots  backoff  and  times  into  backoff,  which  are  measures  of  how  many  times  a  vehicle 

invoked C.W. 

  Physical layer busy time and MAC busy time represent each vehicle channel busy time. 
  Total  lost  packets  and  generated/received  beacon  messages  (WSM,  BSM,  WSA)  are 
measures  of  how  many  times  a  vehicle  can  send/receive  packets  on  its  channel  with  no 
packet repetition.  

For  performance  evaluation,  we  compare  our  model  against  the  standard  IEEE  802.11p  in  two 
different  maps. The  first  map  is  the  default  Veins'  framework  map,  and  the  second  is  the  New 
Administrative  capital  city  in  Egypt.  In  both  maps,  we  follow  [22,  27,  31, 33] to  configure  the 
number of RSU, interval, and length of a beacon, data length, and mobility model. Simulation of 
Urban Mobility (SUMO) 0.30.0 is used to simulate road traffic, and Objective Modular Network 
Testbed  in  C++  (OMNeT++)  5.4.1  is  used  to  simulate  V2V  and  V2I  networks;  Veins  5.0  is  a 
framework for vehicular networks that is based on OMNeT++ and SUMO. To import the second 
map, we used Open Street Map (OSM), a simulator for a geographical database that is based on 
Google maps. Finally, we used MATLAB 2016b fuzzy toolbox to create the fuzzy model. 

Figure 2 shows the fuzzy model processing when creating or receiving a packet. First, a vehicle 
treats the upper message by checking that the message is not scheduled and is not a self-message. 
Then, if the message type is an upper beacon message, the vehicle senses the channel by sending 
a request to other vehicles.  

3.1.  Fuzzy Model F-802.11p   

A fuzzy model is a mathematical representation of a relationship that deals with multi-criteria in 
vague  conditions  and  contains  inputs  (I),  outputs  (O),  linguistic  terms  (representation  of  labels 
and  intervals),  and  membership functions (representation of truth degree), and IF…THEN rule-
base (representation of knowledgebase) [54]. Herein, the F-802.11p contains three inputs: speed 
(s), sender gain (SG), and receiver gain (RG), one output: channel idle time, referred to as factor 
(F),  and  nine  IF…THEN…rules.  All  parameters  are  normalized  in  the  range  [0,1].  The 
fuzzification  membership  functions  (MFs)  used  for  I  and  O  are  triangular  and  trapezoidal. 
Equations  (1)  and  (2)  show  the  MFs  for  triangular  and  trapezoidal,  respectively.  Multiple  tries 
give the selection of MF [36]. Also, the linguistic term is accepted when the input is in the range

3.1.1.  Inputs 

The input variables are speed (S), sender gain (SG), and receiver gain (RG). The speed is described 
through  five  linguistic  terms:  R  = resident,  M =  move,  N  =  normal,  SL  = slow,  and  Fa  =  fast. 
Three linguistic terms describe the sender gain and receiver gain: W = weak, M = medium, and E 
= Excellent. The universe of discourse for S is [0, 27.78], for SG is [0, 1], and for RG is [0,1]. The 
fuzzification  membership functions for  SG and RG are triangular for all linguistic variables. The 
fuzzification  membership  functions  (MFs)  for  S  are  triangular  and  trapezoidal,  as  illustrated  in 
Figures 3 and 4.

3.1.2.  The Fuzzy Rules 

The fuzzy IF…THEN…rules represent the knowledge base of the fuzzy model, which could be 
built by a domain expert or fuzzy clustering [29]. In this work, the presented rules are obtained by 
the fuzzy C-means algorithm (FCM) [24]. This clustering algorithm  drawback is that there is no 
prior knowledge about the number of clusters. Therefore, an intensive analysis of the number of 
clusters has been done from cluster numbers 3 to 40. We started with 17 rules and minimized by 
a distance matrix to nine rules [26, 32]. The fuzzy inference system (FIS) type is Mamdani, the 
"And"  method is min, the "OR" method is max, and the defuzzification is the centroid. Table 3 
shows the nine "IF-THEN-Rules". 

3.1.3.  Outputs 

The  output  variable  is  the  factor  (F),  representing  the  idle  seconds  each  vehicle  could  have  to 
transmit beacons. F is described through 3 linguistic terms:  A = bad, G = good,  VG = V.good.  
The universe of discourse for F (Channel idle time) is [0, 87.1]. The defuzzification membership 
functions  are  trapezoidal  for  the  first  and  second  linguistic  term  and  triangular  for  the  third 
linguistic term. Figure 5 shows the membership function with linguistic terms.

4.  EVALUATION ENVIRONMENT 

IEEE 802.11p and F-802.11p are evaluated in an environment that includes OMNeT++, SUMO, 
Veins 5.0 framework for V2X, and MATLAB R2016b fuzzy toolbox in two scenarios. The first 
scenario uses the Veins framework map with 6 Mbps as a bit rate to compare both protocols and 
a  20*100  m*m  area.  The  vehicles’  speed  is  randomly  varied  between  0  and  30  km/h  with  a 
vehicle's density of 44 that was generated by the framework. For the second scenario simulation

area, the existing road network of the New Administrative Capital (NAC) in Egypt is considered. 
The satellite image  of the NAC road network is retrieved from the Open Street Map (OSM). A 
realistic road traffic scenario is created with the help  of Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). 
The second scenario area is a 100*100 m*m area with 27 Mbps as a bit rate, and vehicles' speed 
was varied between 0 to 80 km/h with a density of 193 that was generated from an actual traffic 
flow. Also, the second scenario was restricted to the mentioned area due to simulation issues. A 
simple application has been added to the application layer in both scenarios. Also, F-802.11p is 
enabled with the acceptance condition "Good" for the first scenario and "V.Good" for the second 
scenario. Table 4 shows the standard settings of the two scenarios. Both scenarios cover low and 
high vehicle density and highway and urban areas.

5.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Twelve experiments are performed to compare our proposed F-802.11p against the IEEE 802.11p 
in the two scenarios presented above. Figures 6 through 17 present the results of the experiments. 
The discussions of the results of conducted experiments are presented as follows: 

Busy time of MAC and Physical layers: A vehicle considers a channel idle if the summation of 
MAC busy time and PHY busy time is idle. The total busy time measures how many seconds the 
MAC layer treated the channel as busy, while busy time  is a PHY layer measure that increases 
for each frame received above a sensitivity threshold. Figures 6 and 7 show both scenarios' total 
busy time and busy time. A vehicle drops a packet(s) when it has an out speed normalized range 
(SL or Fa) and out sender/receiver gain normalized range (M) when using F-802.11p. Thus, the 
F-802.11p limits the number of processed packets in MAC and PHY layers. However, vehicles in 
a dense vehicle network satisfy the model constraints as in Figure 6 (b), so they take some time to 
process  the  packets.  Due  to  their  small  numbers,  the  PHY  is  processes-free,  as  illustrated  in 
Figure  7  (b).  Therefore,  the  PHY  busy  time  and  the  MAC  total  busy  time  are  reduced 
consequently, and the F-802.11p outperforms the standard IEEE 802.11p.

Generated WSMs, BSMs, and WSAs: The Wave Short Message (WSM) is a periodic message 
created by the vehicle to its neighbors with its current state. A basic safety message (BSM) is a 
non-periodic  broadcast  message  that  is  triggered  by  a  vehicle  to  alert  dangerous  traffic

circumstances  (intersection  collisions).  A  Wave  short  advertisement  message  (WSA)  is  a  non-
periodic broadcast message that is created by a vehicle to inform infotainment services. Figures 
8,  9,  and  10  present  the  collected  results  for  generated  WSMs,  BSMs,  and  WSAs  for  both 
scenarios.  

Figure  8  (a)  shows  that  the  number  of  WSMs  created  by  IEEE  802.11p  is  less  than  those 
produced  by  F-802.11p.  However,  both  do  not  exceed  five  messages  during  the  simulation 
interval.  Controlling  the  MAC  and  PHY  layer  when  transmitting  packets  drops  packets  until 
vehicle(s) is under speed and sender/receiver gain allowed ranges when using F-802.11p requires 
additional  effort  to  broadcast  messages.  Therefore,  IEEE  802.11p  outperforms  F-802.11p  in  a 
low-dense network. However, RSU creates multiple WSMs in case of using IEEE 802.11p more 
than those using F-802.11p. Figure 8 (b) contains a dense vehicle network, the performance of F-
802.11p  is  almost  similar  to  IEEE  802.11p  except  in  some  vehicles  (15,  75,  90).  F-802.11p 
creates  no  messages  due  to  the  organizing  of  speed  and  sender/receiver  gain  allowed  range; 
vehicles have no changes in their states. In contrast, the organizing has a trade-off as in vehicles 
(60) that requires more messages.  

BSM  should  be  delivered  to  the  nearest  vehicle(s)  of  the  situation  (accident  or  road  collision). 
Delivering a message to a far or un-participated vehicle consumes bandwidth. Figure 9 (a) shows 
that the performance of F-802.11p is almost similar to IEEE 802.11p. Figure 9 (b) shows that the 
number  of  BSMs  created  by  IEEE  802.11p  is  more  than  those  produced  by  F-802.11p  because 
vehicles  are  under  fuzzy  model  requirements,  so  they  wait  to  be  under  speed  and  sender/gain 
allowed ranges. 

As the number of the requested service(s) by vehicles increases, the number of generated WSAs 
increases when using F-802.11p. Figure 10 (a) shows that F-802.11p generates an extra message 
because the vehicle's speed or gain is not in the range of the accepted linguistic term. In Figure 10 
(b), vehicle density (60) generates one message more than IEEE 802.11p because some vehicles 
are not satisfying the fuzzy model accepted conditions. However, vehicles (30, 45, 105, 120, 150) 
F-802.11p  is  almost  similar  to  IEEE  802.11p.  In  contrast,  F-802.11p  outperforms  the  standard 
IEEE 802.11p in  vehicles (15, 75, 90, 135, 165, 180, 195) because some  vehicles require  more 
messages to get service due they are out of communication range of the requested vehicle or their 
packets have collided.  

Sent  packets:  Sent  packets  (SP)  include  packets  sent  during  message  dissemination,  generated 
WSMs, WSAs, and BSMs. Figure 11 shows the SP for both scenarios. The SP using F-802.11p is 
greater  than  the  IEEE  802.11p  due  to  fuzzy  model  controls  vehicle  transmitting  packets  with 
speed  (10-27.78)  for  the  first  scenario  and  speed  for  the  second  scenario  (13-27.78).  However, 
RSU  in  Figure  11  (a) and  vehicles  (165,  180,  195)  in  Figure  11  (b)  that  use  the  IEEE  802.11p 
need additional packets because of the increasing time for backoff when sensing a channel busy.

Received  WSM,  BSM,  and  WSA:  Received  WSM  is  a  metric  for  how  frequently  vehicles 
change  their  states.  Received  BSM  measures  how  often  vehicles  are  informed  of  a  critical 
situation(s).  Received  WSA  presents  the  summation  of  informing  requests  about  services. 
However, these broadcast messages strongly affect backoff and channel activity. Figures  12, 13, 
and 14 present both scenarios' collected results for received WSMs, BSMs, and WSAs.  

In  Figure  12  (a),  all  vehicle’s  received  other  vehicle’s  change  states,  and  due  to  no 
acknowledgment messages and broadcasting procedures, vehicles receive duplicate WSMs in the 
case  of  IEEE  802.11p.  Vehicles  that  use  F-802.11p  cannot  accept  such  messages  because  the 
model requires all vehicles to be in a range of speed and a range of sender/receiver gain, i.e., the 
vehicle states kept known with no changes. Consequently, the model drops initial and redundant 
packets.  In  Figure  12  (b),  the  behavior  of  F-802.11p  is  as  scenario  1  considers  sender/receiver 
gain. When a vehicle finds receiver gain lower than a threshold, it waits and keeps the channel 
idle.  Vehicles  that  use  IEEE  802.11p  receive  changes  on  other  vehicles'  states  because  the 
broadcasted vehicle is in the communication range of other vehicles with no threshold.  

In Figure 13 (a), all vehicles are informed of dangerous situations from other vehicles, and due to 
no acknowledgment  messages and broadcasting procedures, vehicles receive duplicate BSMs in 
the  case  of  IEEE  802.11p.  Due  to  the  model  limitations,  vehicles  that  use  F-802.11p  cannot 
receive such  messages. If a situation  occurs, the broadcasted  vehicle is in the same direction as 
the  informed  vehicles.  Hence,  there  is  no  need  for  broadcasting  or  in  another  direction  as 
informed  vehicles  and  also  no  need  for  broadcasting.  In  Figure  13  (b),  F-802.11p  considers 
sender/receiver gain. Thus when it finds that the receiver gain is lower than a threshold, it waits 
and  keeps  the  channel  idle.  When  using  IEEE  802.11p,  the  average  received  BSMs  is  reduced 
because the broadcasted vehicle communication range cannot cover other vehicles. 

In  Figure  14  (a), all  vehicles  received  WSAs  because  of  the  broadcasting  procedures.  Vehicles 
receive duplicate WSAs in the case of IEEE 802.11p. Vehicles that use F-802.11p cannot accept 
such messages because of the model requirements (speed and gain). In Figure 14 (b), F-802.11p 
considers sender/receiver gain; thus, when  it finds receiver gain  is lower than a threshold (THi, 
THj), it waits and keeps the channel idle. When using IEEE 802.11p, the average received BSMs 
is reduced because vehicles are out of the range of the broadcasted vehicle.

Total lost packets: Total lost packets were the summation of lost packets when the interference 
occurred,  either  bit  error  or  collision.  Figure  15  depicts  the  F-802.11p  and  IEEE  802.11p 
collected results for both scenarios. Figure 15 (a) and (b) shows that F-802.11p outperforms IEEE 
802.11p.  Using  F-802.11p  increases  the  channel  idle  time  by  reducing  redundant  packets, 
reducing the number of collided packets, and decreasing  the bit error rate. Using IEEE 802.11p, 
each  vehicle  receives  a  broadcast  and  rebroadcasts  the  message  resulting  in  more  message 
collisions or interruptions. 

Time  into  backoff:  Time  into  backoff  is  the  number  of  times  the  vehicle  is  in  backoff.  Slots 
backoff is the number of slots due to backoff. Time into backoff and slots backoff  has a strong 
positive correlation with CSMA/CA MAC protocol as they express how often a channel sensed 
busy.  Figures  16  and  17  show  the  time  into  backoff  and  slots  backoff  for  both  scenarios.  In 
Figure 16 (a), and due to F-802.11p limitations, vehicles are not satisfying the conditions of the 
fuzzy model while they sense a channel idle. Therefore, they require several backoff times more 
than traditional IEEE 802.11p. Vehicles (15) and RSU get into backoff when using IEEE 802.11p 
because  a  channel  is  sensed  busy.  Generally,  F-802.11p  acts  as  IEEE  802.11p  in  times  into 
backoff. The behavior of F-802.11p and IEEE 802.11p in Figure 16 (a) is similar to that in Figure 
16 (b).  

Vehicles  may select the same slot backoff size, and in transmitting, their packets will collide in 
the medium. In Figure 17 (a), most vehicles that use F-802.11p require additional slots than IEEE 
802.11p  because  they  are  under  fuzzy  model  constraints  that  need  vehicles  to  wait  until  they 
reach  accepted  condition  boundaries.  However,  RSU  using  IEEE  802.11p  does  more  slots  than 
the  fuzzy  model  because  it  frequently  senses  the  channel  busy. The  behavior  of  F-802.11p and 
IEEE 802.11p in Figure 17 (a) is similar to that of Figure 17 (b).

6.  CONCLUSION 

In  this  paper,  we  presented  F-802.11p,  a  fuzzy  model  that  controls  the  broadcast  of  the  WSM, 
WSA,  and  BSM  messages.  Before  broadcasting  these  messages,  the  vehicle  checks  its  status 
according to the F-802.11p. If the vehicle's status is within the F-802.11p allowable threshold, it 
processes the  message, drops it, and  waits. Consequently,  the  number of processed  messages is 
decreased. 

We  have  evaluated  our  proposed  fuzzy  mode  against  the  IEEE  802.11p  using  OMNeT++, 
SUMO, Veins 5.0 framework for V2X, and MATLAB R2016b fuzzy toolbox in two scenarios. 
The  first  scenario  uses  the  Veins  framework.  The  second  scenario  uses  the  OpenStreetMap 
simulator. We conducted twelve experiments that measured the busy time of MAC and Physical 
layers, generated WSMs, BSMs, and WSAs sent packets, received WSM, BSM, and WSA, total 
lost packets, and time into backoff.  

F-802.11p  forms  a  scheme  of  arrangement  between  vehicles  while  sending/receiving  airframes 
messages.  This  arrangement  reduces  the  collided  packets  by  98%,  redundant  packets  sent  by 
18.5%,  network  overhead  by  98%,  and  increases  channel  idle  time  by  95%  compared  to  IEEE 
802.11p.  In  addition,  F-802.11p  improves  the  busy  time,  total  busy  without  loss  of  safety,  lost 
packets, and the number of backoff times. In general, F-802.11p is more suitable when vehicles' 
speed is restricted to 80 km/h.  

During  the  simulation  and  evaluation  of  F-802.11p,  intensive  computational  resources  were 
required, synchronizing OMNET++ and SUMO was needed, and a lack of implementation steps 
in  publications  worked  against  numerical  comparison.  In  the  future,  more  factors  and  metrics 
may  be  considered  in  the  fuzzy  model  to  enhance  the  slots  backoff  and  times  into  backoff 
decision-making.
