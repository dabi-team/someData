ABSTRACT
Eclipsing binaries are important benchmark objects to test and calibrate stellar structure and evolution models. This is especially
true for binaries with a fully convective M-dwarf component for which direct measurements of these stars’ masses and radii
are diﬃcult using other techniques. Within the potential of M-dwarfs to be exoplanet host stars, the accuracy of theoretical
predictions of their radius and eﬀective temperature as a function of their mass is an active topic of discussion. Not only
the parameters of transiting exoplanets but also the success of future atmospheric characterisation rely on accurate theoretical
predictions. We present the analysis of ﬁve eclipsing binaries with low-mass stellar companions out of a sub-sample of 23, for
which we obtained ultra high-precision light curves using the CHEOPS satellite. The observation of their primary and secondary
eclipses are combined with spectroscopic measurements to precisely model the primary parameters and derive the M-dwarfs
mass, radius, surface gravity, and eﬀective temperature estimates using the PYCHEOPS data analysis software. Combining these
results to the same set of parameters derived from TESS light curves, we ﬁnd very good agreement (better than 1% for radius
and better than 0.2% for surface gravity). We also analyse the importance of precise orbits from radial velocity measurements
and ﬁnd them to be crucial to derive M-dwarf radii in a regime below 5% accuracy. These results add ﬁve valuable data points
to the mass-radius diagram of fully-convective M-dwarfs.

Low-mass main-sequence stars of M-type (M-dwarfs) have been in
the spotlight of recent exoplanet surveys (Nutzman & Charbonneau

D. Sebastian et al.

2008; Delrez et al. 2018; Barclay et al. 2018; Quirrenbach et al.
2019; Donati et al. 2020). This development has two main reasons.
First their low masses, and radii, compared to F, G, and K stars make
it easier to detect small planets and planetary systems composed
of mini Neptunes down to Earth sized planets by means of radial
velocity and transit methods (e.g. Gillon et al. 2016; Zechmeister
et al. 2019; Günther et al. 2019). Thus, more Earth sized planets
have been found in the habitable zone of M-dwarfs than for solar-
type stars (e.g. Dressing & Charbonneau 2013). Second, M-dwarfs
have low luminosities and, thus oﬀer the ﬁrst possible window to
study transiting rocky planets in their habitable zone and directly
analyse their atmospheres with high-precision instruments like the
James Webb Space telescope (Kaltenegger & Traub 2009; Morley
et al. 2017).

Such studies depend crucially on the knowledge of the parameters
of M-dwarf planets which in turn are derived from the mass and
radius of the host M-dwarf. Up to now our understanding on the mass
and radius distribution of low-mass stars which are fully convective
(M★ < 0.35 M(cid:12), Chabrier & Baraﬀe 1997) is rather poorly explored
compared to more massive stars. This is mainly due to the relative
faintness of these stars1. Especially the lack of a large sample of
M-dwarfs with directly measured mass and radius make it diﬃcult to
calibrate stellar evolution models which are typically used to estimate
the properties of planet host stars like for example the Exeter/Lyon
models (Baraﬀe et al. 2015) or the Dartmouth models (Dotter et al.
2008).

Studies of M-stars with available radii and masses have revealed
that their stellar radii for a given mass are apparently inﬂated by a
few percent, compared to estimates from models (e.g. Casagrande
et al. 2008; Torres et al. 2010; Spada et al. 2013; Kesseli et al. 2018).
Several possible explanations have been discussed, like stellar
magnetic activity (Mullan & MacDonald 2001; Chabrier et al. 2007),
or a bias due to binarity (Ribas 2006; Morales et al. 2009). Also metal-
licity eﬀects seem to play a role (Berger et al. 2006; von Boetticher
et al. 2019). Thus, a representative sample of low-mass M-dwarfs
with accurately measured mass, radius, but also metallicity is crucial
to understand how the diﬀerent eﬀects enter into this radius inﬂation
problem.

The eclipsing binaries with low mass (EBLM) project (Triaud
et al. 2013) is focusing on a large sample with hundreds of eclips-
ing binaries of F,G, & K-type stars, orbited by late type M-dwarf
companions. These binaries have been detected from the WASP sur-
vey (Pollacco et al. 2006). Using a large radial velocity follow-up
campaign of these stars, Triaud et al. (2017) derived accurate orbits
of many of these systems thus being able to measure fundamental
parameters like precise mass and radius of the low-mass M-dwarfs.
The binary conﬁguration with a solar-type star allows us to measure
accurately the metallicity of the solar-type star. Assuming an equal
metallicity of both components, we can constrain the metallicity of
the M-dwarf. Thus, EBLM targets are ideal candidates to populate
the mass regime of fully convective M-dwarfs with masses below
0.35 M(cid:12) and to establish an empirical mass-radius-metallicity rela-
tionship for these stars. Early results from sub samples indicate that
models can be matched quite well, when taking accurate measure-
ments of the metallicty of the M-dwarf into account (von Boetticher
et al. 2019; Gill et al. 2019). Every low-mass M-dwarf with accu-
rately measured mass, radius and metallicity will help to tighten the
constraints on the source of the radius inﬂation problem and in return

distance has a visual magnitude of only 18.8 mag .

will allow us in future to constrain precise parameters of planet host
stars.

CHEOPS (Benz et al. 2021) is a S-class mission of the European
Space Agency, which has been launched on the 18th of December
2019. Its primary mission is to perform ultra high-precision pho-
tometry of bright exoplanet host-stars. We have started an ‘Ancillary
Science’ programme on a selection of 23 EBLM targets, to obtain
precise measurements of primary and secondary eclipses, which al-
low us to (i) derive the size of both components and (ii) to measure
the M-dwarf eﬀective temperature from the surface brightness ra-
tios. Additionally, we use light curves, obtained by the TESS survey
(Ricker et al. 2015), which covers the northern and southern hemi-
spheres with observing periods of about one month per pointing
(sector). TESS cameras have a three times smaller aperture com-
pared to CHEOPS, leading to a lower accuracy for eclipse events
in TESS data. Nevertheless, the long coverage of photometric data
allows us to gather multiple eclipses of our targets and thus improve
and compare orbital parameters, as well as to optimise our analysis
of CHEOPS observations.

The three EBLM binaries, analysed in our CHEOPS pro-
gramme EBLM J1741+31, EBLM J1934-42 and EBLM J2046+06
have shown that M-dwarfs with precisely measured radii and metal-
licities open up the possibility to disentangle the eﬀect of metallicity
from diﬀerent eﬀects on the radius inﬂation problem for low-mass
M-dwarfs (Swayne et al. 2021).

In this paper we present the analysis of ﬁve EBLM binaries with
fully convective M-dwarfs companions, observed in our CHEOPS
programme and compare them to the analysis of TESS observations.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND METHODS

Primary and secondary eclipses for all our ﬁve eclipsing binaries
were observed with CHEOPS between November 2020 and January
2021 as part of CHEOPS Guaranteed Time Observation programme
ID-037. We obtained one primary eclipse and, depending on the
depth of the secondary eclipse, one to three secondary eclipse obser-
vations in order to obtain suﬃcient signal to noise to measure both
eclipses. Table 1 gives an overview of the CHEOPS observations and
data extraction. All data were reduced by the CHEOPS data reduc-
tion pipeline v13.1 (Hoyer et al. 2020), which performs an aperture
photometry of the target star, taking contamination in the ﬁeld as well
as instrumental eﬀects like the rotation of the satellite into account.
The pipeline oﬀers light curves for diﬀerent aperture sizes. For our
analysis, we selected the aperture size with minimal median absolute
deviation of the point-to-point diﬀerence in the light curve. The re-
sulting aperture radii are listed as Rap in Table 1. The observations
were interrupted due to the low-Earth-orbit of CHEOPS by Earth
occultations, as well as crossings of the South Atlantic Anomaly. We
derive the time spent on target as the fraction of valid observations
compared to the total observation interval.

The TESS survey covered all of our targets with 2-min cadence
data made available by TESS Guest Investigator (GI) programmes.
EBLM J0239-20 (TIC64108432) has been observed in sectors 4
and 31 under GI programmes G011278 and G03216. EBLM J0540-
17 (TIC46627823) has been observed in sectors 6 and 32 under
GI programmes G011278, G03216, & G03251. EBLM J0546-18
(TIC93334206) has been observed in sectors 32 and 33 under GI
programme G03216. EBLM J0719+25 (TIC458377744) has recently
been observed in sectors 44, 45, & 46 under GI programme G04157
and EBLM J2359+44 (TIC177644756) has been observed in sector
17 under GI programmes G022253 & G022156. Data reduction and

1 For this observation the secondary eclipse of EBLM J0719+25 has been missed, thus we cannot use this data set for parameter determination of the binary.

light curve extraction were done by the TESS Science Processing Op-
erations Center Pipeline (SPOC; Jenkins et al. 2016) and were down-
loaded via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes2 (MAST). For
our analysis, we used Pre-search Data Conditioned Simple Aperture
Photometry (PDCSAP) ﬂux data and bitmask 175 to exclude data
ﬂagged with severe quality issues (Tenenbaum & Jenkins 2018).

For EBLM J2359+44 two radial velocity measurements have been
published by Poleski et al. (2010) that conﬁrmed it to be a binary star.
Full time series radial velocity observations of EBLM J0719+25 and
EBLM J2359+44 have been taken with the SOPHIE high-resolution
echelle spectrograph (Perruchot et al. 2008), mounted on the 1.93 m
telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence in France as part
of the Binaries Escorted By Orbiting Planets (BEBOP) survey to
search for circumbinary planets (Martin et al. 2019). For EBLM
J0719+25, 8 SOPHIE spectra have been obtained between November
2018 and October 2019 in High-Resolution mode (R = 75 000). For
EBLM J2359+44, 15 SOPHIE spectra have been obtained between
November 2018 and September 2020 in High-Resolution mode (R
= 75 000) as well as in High-Eﬃciency (HE) mode (R = 40 000).
The HE mode allows an about 2.5 times higher throughput compared
to the High-Resolution mode. The spectra have an average signal to
noise of about 30 with a typical exposure time of 1800 s. To allow
the removal of the background contamination from the Moon, all
observations were taken with one ﬁbre on target and one on the
sky. The spectra were reduced using the SOPHIE Data Reduction
Software (Baranne et al. 1996) and radial velocities were measured
by cross correlation with a G2 mask (Courcol et al. 2015) for which
we achieved a typical precision of 10 m s−1 for our spectra. All radial
velocity measurements are listed in the Appendix Tables B1 & B2.
We submitted a target list of 40 EBLM systems from Triaud et al.
(2017) as a priority 4 proposal to be observed with high resolution
spectrograph (Crause et al. 2014) of the Southern African Large
Telescope (SALT) in medium resolution (𝑅 ≈ 37, 000). In total, 30
of them were observed between the 19th of May and 7th August 2017,

including EBLM J0239-20. These observations were made in long
slit mode with an exposure time scaling as a function of magnitude to
ensure a SNR ≥ 100. Data was reduced and processed using standard
pipelines (Crawford 2015; Craig et al. 2015) to produce two spectra
for each observation (370–550 nm & 550–890 nm) as a result of the
dual-beam nature of the spectrograph.

3 ANALYSIS

√

e cos(𝜔) and fs =

For data analysis, we followed the methods, described in Swayne
et al. (2021), hereafter SW21. Both TESS and CHEOPS light curves
were modelled using the qpower2 transit model, which applies a
power-2 limb darkening law (Maxted & Gill 2019). We use it as
binary star model including primary and secondary eclipses which
is implemented in the python software PYCHEOPS3 (Maxted et al.
2021). The parameters of the binary star model are the orbital period
P, the mid-time of the primary eclipse T0; the primary and secondary
eclipse depths D and L, the impact parameter b, the parameters fc =
√
e sin(𝜔), which parameterise the eccentricity
e and the longitude of periastron 𝜔, the limb darkening parameters
h1 and h2 (Maxted 2018), and W, which becomes the width of the
eclipse for e = 0 and is deﬁned by the stellar radii, impact parameter,
and the semi mayor axis a (see Maxted et al. (2021) for details).
We used gaussian priors for fc, fs. These priors were derived from
radial velocity measurements of the systems. Orbital parameters from
radial velocity measurements for EBLM J0239-20, EBLM J0540-17,
and EBLM J0546-18 have been published in Triaud et al. (2017).
Their eccentricities are reported to be consistent to zero, thus we set
those priors to zero for all three systems. For EBLM J0719+25 and
EBLM J2359+44, we used the binary star python code ellc (Maxted
2016), to model the radial velocity from SOPHIE measurements as
well as the two measurements from Poleski et al. (2010) for EBLM
J2359+44. We sampled the posterior probability distribution (PPD)
of our model parameters fc, fs, and the semi amplitude K, using the

3.1 TESS light curve analysis

Only segments of the TESS light curve within one eclipse duration of
the time of mid-eclipse were used in this analysis. To remove trends
in the light curve, we divided these segments by a linear polynomial
model ﬁtted to the data either side of the eclipse. Unlike SW21, we
preferred this method over the use of a Gaussian process in order to
securely preserve the transit shape of the faint secondary eclipses.

To model the light curve, we ﬁrst determined the initial orbital
parameters using a least-squares ﬁt and then sampled the PPD of
our transit model using EMCEE. We placed normal priors on the
orbital parameters fc, fs, as listed in Table 3 as well as on the white
noise, using the residual rms of the least-squares ﬁt. The resulting
parameters from the TESS light curves are detailed in Tables 4, 5, &
6. These represent the median of the PPD as well as the standard
errors from the 15.9% and 84.1% percentile-points of the PPD. We
show the resulting ﬁts of all targets in the Appendix, Fig. D3 and
Fig. D2.

3.2 CHEOPS light curve analysis

CHEOPS light curves were analysed in two steps. First we analysed
every visit separately to derive initial model parameters (see Table 1
for an overview of all visits). As described in detail in SW21, instru-
mental eﬀects like roll angle, contamination, and background level
can be represented using linear correlation parameters or for roll an-
gle 𝜙, sin(𝜙), cos(𝜙), sin(2𝜙), etc., which were iteratively selected4.
The PPD of all model and decorellation parameters were sampled
simultaneously using EMCEE. We used the same Gaussian priors for
fc, and fs as for the TESS data and since we obtained single eclipse
events, we ﬁxed our transit model to accurately measured orbital pe-
riod P, from the TESS light curve ﬁt. For secondary eclipses, we used
priors on the parameters D, W and b, as derived from the primary
eclipse of each target.

In a second step, we were using a single MCMC to perform a
’multivisit’ analysis including all visits for a speciﬁc target. We
used the same priors as for the individual analysis as well as the
results as input parameters and used the function multivisit of
PYCHEOPS to sample the joint PPD with EMCEE. Hereby we used the
implicit decorrelation method for instrumental trends as described in
Maxted et al. (2021), keeping the number of harmonic terms to its
default (Nroll = 3). The resulting parameters from the CHEOPS light
curves are detailed in Tables 4, 5, & 6. These represent the median
of the PPD as well as the standard errors from the 15.9% and 84.1%
percentile-points of the PPD. We show the resulting ﬁts of all targets
in the Appendix, Fig. E1, Fig. E2, and Fig. E3 and in Table A1 the
resulting decorrelation parameters from the multivisit analysis.

3.3 Stellar parameters

We used co-added high-resolution spectra to derive the stellar pa-
rameters of the primary components (Teﬀ and [Fe/H]). For EBLM
J0540-17, we used co-added CORALIE spectra, obtained by Triaud
et al. (2017) and available from the ESO science archive facility5
and co-added SOPHIE spectra for EBLM J0719+25 and EBLM
J2359+44. The stellar parameters for these three targets were derived

using the equivalent width method following the same methodol-
ogy, model atmospheres, and line list as described in Sousa (2014)
and Santos et al. (2013). In here we applied the ARES code (Sousa
et al. 2015), as well as the MOOG radiative transfer code (Sneden
et al. 2012), assuming ionisation and excitation equilibrium of iron
lines. For EBLM J0546-18 we used co-added CORALIE spectra
and applied a wavelet decomposition method where we compare the
coeﬃcients from a wavelet decomposition to those from a grid of
model spectra. Those model spectra were synthesised using the code
SPECTRUM (Gray & Corbally 1994), MARCS model atmospheres
(Gustafsson et al. 2008) as well as the atomic line list version 5 of the
Gaia ESO survey (Heiter et al. 2015). The method is detailed in Gill
et al. (2018) and has been found to deliver robust measurements for
eﬀective temperature and metallicity for spectra with relatively low
SNR (SNR (cid:39) 40). For EBLM J0239-20 we used the SALT spectra
and modeled the stellar fundamental parameters using the software
SME6 (Spectroscopy Made Easy; Valenti & Piskunov 1996; Piskunov
& Valenti 2017) that computes synthetic spectra with atomic and
molecular line data from VALD7 (Ryabchikova et al. 2015) which is
compared to the observations. We chose the stellar atmosphere grid
Atlas12 (Kurucz 2013) and modelled Teﬀ, log g1, abundances and
v sin i one parameter at a time. Due to the high rotational velocity
(v sin i = 31 ± 4 km s−1), the uncertainties in log g1 derived from the
line wings of the Ca i triplet around 6200 is with 0.2 dex relatively
high. We thus rely on the lightcurve modelling to derive the surface
gravity of our targets.

Similarly to SW21, we derived the system parameters using the
function massradius in PYCHEOPS. As explained in Maxted et al.
(2021), this function applies a Monte Carlo approach to derive basic
system parameters like the primaries mean stellar density, the mass
and radius of the M-dwarf, using the PPD of our CHEOPS light curve
ﬁt. It additionally uses the primaries mass and radius, as well as the
orbital parameters which were not sampled in the PPD like period,
and eccentricity as input and derives the surface gravity log g2 of
the M-dwarf using the radial-velocity semi-amplitudes.We used this
function to optimise the global system parameters in a two stage
iterative process.

In the ﬁrst step, we used the primaries mass and radius estimates
available from the TESS input catalogue v8 (Stassun et al. 2019)
as initial parameters. The derivation of these estimates is based on
an empirical relation including photometric eﬀective temperature
estimates for stars with well measured Gaia distances. We used the
same priors for period and eccentricity that we used for our CHEOPS
ﬁt, as well as the semi-amplitudes from radial velocity measurements.
For EBLM J0239-20, EBLM J0540-17, and EBLM J0546-18 we
have used the published semi-amplitudes (Triaud et al. 2017), For
For EBLM J0719+25 and EBLM J2359+44, we use the results from
our orbital ﬁt (see Table 2).

In a second iteration, we made use of the massradius function
again in order to ﬁnd the best ﬁtting parameters of the primary mass
and radius from our light curve ﬁt. We used the relation of Enoch
et al. (2010) (equation 4), to derive a mass sample for the primary
star. This sample is based on the stellar density samples obtained
from the ﬁrst iteration and created similar sized samples for Teﬀ and
[Fe/H] based on our spectroscopic stellar parameters. We then added
a normal distributed scatter of 0.023 to account for the resulting
scatter for this relation found by Enoch et al. (2010). We derived a
radius sample using this mass sample as well as the density sample.

M-dwarfs measured with CHEOPS

5

We used the mass and radius samples to re-run the massradius
function to derive the ﬁnal stellar parameters of the primary and
M-dwarf components. We ﬁnally derived the surface gravity log g1
from the stellar density, directly measured from the light curve ﬁt of
our CHEOPS data, as well as the primaries mass derived from the
previous step.

We derived the eﬀective temperature Teﬀ,2 of the M-dwarf com-
panion using the surface brightness ratio L/D, derived from the light
curve ﬁt of primary and secondary eclipses. Similar to SW21, we
derived the integrated surface brightness in the CHEOPS and TESS
bandbands of the primary star, using the spectral parameters Teﬀ,2,
log g1, and [Fe/H] using PHOENIX model atmospheres with no
alpha-element enhancement (Husser et al. 2013) and sampled a large
set of surface temperatures over the known parameters, L/D, log g,
and [Fe/H] (assuming similar metallicity for both companions) to
derive the eﬀective temperature.

The light contribution from the primary star reﬂected to the M-
dwarf can be expressed by Ag (R2/a)2, where Ag is the geometric
albedo and R2/a is the radius of the M-dwarfs in units of the semi
mayor axis, which we directly measure from our model. With a typical
albedo of Ag ∼ 0.1 (Marley et al. 1999), the light contribution for our
targets is very small and thus negligible. Nevertheless, for the two
shortest period binaries in our sample, EBLM J0239-20 and EBLM
J0546-18 the light contribution might cause an underestimation of
the secondary eclipse depth on the one sigma level and thus an
underestimation of Teﬀ,2 in the order of 1 % for both CHEOPS and
TESS passbands. Thus, we increased the relative uncertainties for
Teﬀ,2 for EBLM J0239-20 and EBLM J0546-18 by 1% in order to
account for the unknown uncertainty of Ag.

All parameters of the primary stars are listed in Table 2, all pa-
rameters for the M-dwarf companions are listed in Tables 4, 5, & 6.

4 DISCUSSION

We have derived the stellar parameters for both companions for all
of our targets thanks to high precision CHEOPS light curves. For
the M-dwarfs we derive accurate radii with an average uncertainty
of 3.2 ± 1.3% and the surface gravity with an average uncertainty
of 0.4 ± 0.3%. This precision for the surface gravity of M-dwarfs
is better then, or hardly reached with state of the art high-resolution
spectroscopic measurements of ﬁeld M-dwarfs (e.g. Olander et al.
2021; Marﬁl et al. 2021).

4.1 Radial velocity priors

We used priors obtained from the radial velocity (RV) orbital pa-
rameters eccentricity (e) and longitude of periastron (𝜔) to ﬁt our
CHEOPS and TESS light curves. Only EBLM J0719+25 and EBLM
J2359+44 have eccentricities signiﬁcantly larger than zero, the others
we have ﬁxed to zero eccentricity. We analysed the eﬀect of imposing
RV priors on the CHEOPS parameter ﬁt by repeating it with fc and
fs kept as free parameters. Two of our binaries with previously ﬁxed
eccentricities, resulted in eccentricties consistent to zero with EBLM
J0239-20 (e = 0.028 ± 0.058) and EBLM J0546-18 (e = 0.0005 ±
0.0007). For EBLM J0540-17 and EBLM J0719+25 this ﬁt resulted
in a longer MCMC chain, which ﬁnally ended with a less uniformly
deﬁned PPD for W, which was strongly correlated to fc and fs. This
led to up to 5% overestimated radii for the M-dwarfs. Except for these
two stars, the derived model parameters did not deviate more than
1𝜎 from the parameters listed in Tables 4, 5, and 6. Nevertheless,
we found that for the orbital parameters all resulting uncertainties

were about one order of magnitude larger then obtained from the
RV ﬁtting alone. We conclude that even for high precision CHEOPS
light curves, (i) radial velocity measurements are essential to derive
precise radii for low mass eclipsing binaries and (ii) our analysis
method does not allow to constrain the orbital eccentricity from the
light curves better then from radial velocity measurements.

4.2 Comparison to TESS

For all targets, we compared our results from TESS light curve ﬁt-
ting with the CHEOPS results. Both instruments comprise diﬀerent
passbands with the TESS having an redder eﬀective wavelength of
745.6 nm compared to CHEOPS with 581.1 nm8. In this, we do
not compare the limb darkening parameters and absolute eclipse
depths, since these depend on the instrumental passband. The sec-
ondary eclipses are thus 1.5 to 2.5 times deeper in TESS, compared
to CHEOPS. We ﬁnd a good agreement on the derived radius ratio,
inclination and relative primary radii R1/a (<1%). As discussed in
the previous section, using radial velocity priors is essential to derive
precise radii for the M-dwarfs. We ﬁnd that keeping fc and fs as
free parameters results in 3-6% smaller radii for TESS light curves
(for EBLM J0540-17 and EBLM J0719+25), compared to CHEOPS.
Using similar radial velocity priors (see chapter 3.1), we ﬁnd that
the derived radii and surface gravity for the M-dwarfs agree well for
all targets (on average within 0.9% and 0.15% respectively) between
TESS and CHEOPS. We ﬁnd that the uncertainties of the derived
parameters from TESS light curves are of a similar order, compared
to CHEOPS results. TESS is in favour, for relatively bright secondary

M-dwarfs measured with CHEOPS

7

companions with deep secondary eclipse and for targets with short
orbital periods and thus, many eclipses covered during the monitor-
ing. We ﬁnd that the eﬀective temperature of the M-dwarfs, derived
from TESS light curves is in agreement with our CHEOPS value for
EBLM J2359+44, but about 2-4% cooler for our other targets. We
included the result from SW21 for EBLM J1934-42 to analyse for
any systematic diﬀerence between the eﬀective temperature of the
M-dwarf, derived with TESS relative to CHEOPS. We modelled a
constant diﬀerence between two instruments using EMCEE to take the
RV-jitter of the eﬀective temperatures of both TESS and CHEOPS
into account by weighting the ﬁt by the log-likelihood function.
The oﬀset from our sample of six stars results in a slightly lower
(1.11 ± 0.99%) temperature for TESS light curves with a remaining
jitter of 0.0076%.

The small discrepancy in Teﬀ,2 might be caused by an under-
estimation of the secondary eclipse depth (L). In Sec 3.3 we have
discussed that reﬂected light might lead to an underestimated depth
of the secondary eclipse. Nevertheless, this eﬀect aﬀects both pass-
bands of CHEOPS and TESS in a comparable level and only for the
shortest period binaries in our sample. Thus, reﬂection can not ex-
plain this discrepancy. Possible explanations might be uncertainties
introduced by the stellar model we used to derive the temperature
from the surface brightness, or stellar activity of the primary star,
linked to stellar spots which are not accounted for in the eclipse
model, we have used.

4.2.1 Limb darkening parameters

For our CHEOPS and TESS ﬁts, we kept the limb darkening param-
eters h1 and h2 free. To compare our results, we derived expected
limb darkening parameters for EBLM J0239-20, EBLM J0540-17,
EBLM J0546-18, and EBLM J0719+25 by interpolating the tables
for the TESS bandpass and Kepler passband (for CHEOPS data re-
spectively) published in Maxted (2018) using the stellar parameters
Teﬀ,1, log g1, and[Fe/H] as listed in Table 2, and applying an oﬀset
(h1 + 0.01 and h2 − 0.045; (Maxted 2018)). This method did not
converge for the hottest star in our sample EBLM J2359+44 since its
eﬀective temperature exceeds the tabulated temperature range. Thus,
we used the other four targets for this comparison. The expected limb
darkening parameters are listed in Table C1. We ﬁnd that h1 agrees
on average well with diﬀerences of a few percent, while we ﬁnd
larger discrepancies for h2 in the order of several 10 percent simi-
larly in the CHEOPS and TESS data sets. This ﬁnding, as well as the
derived uncertainties follow the trend from Maxted (2018), (Fig 4)
for h2 to be about one order of magnitude less constrained than h1.
We ﬁnd some cases of larger uncertainties in CHEOPS light curve
ﬁts. EBLM J0546-18 we derive about 31% uncertainty for h1 and
the derived parameter, diﬀers more than 70% from the expectations.
This is not surprising, given the large impact parameter which does
not allow to constrain the limb darkening parameters for this star.
We have repeated the CHEOPS and TESS ﬁts for these four targets,
using the expected limb darkening parameters as priors, but found
that introducing these priors will neither improve the ﬁt, nor has it
any signiﬁcant impact on the derived M-dwarf parameters. We, thus,
present in Table 5 the derived parameters without priors for h1 and
h2, noting that the corresponding values are less well constrained
with CHEOPS compared to TESS.

ary. In Fig. 1 we show our ﬁve targets together with the theoretical
mass relation from MIST stellar models for 1 Gyr stars of solar
metallicity ([Fe/H]=0.0) as well as for slightly more metal rich stars
([Fe/H]=0.25) (Dotter 2016; Choi et al. 2016; Paxton et al. 2011).
Similarly to SW21, we compiled a comparison sample of precisely
measured low mass stars from literature, classiﬁed in single stars,
double lined binaries, and single lined binaries. (Carter et al. 2011;
Nefs et al. 2013; Gillen et al. 2017; Parsons et al. 2018; Smith et al.
2021; Swayne et al. 2021). We compared the radii with both the MIST
and the Exeter/Lyon (Baraﬀe et al. 2015) models for solar metallicity.
The M-dwarf radius for EBLM J0239-20 is 11.0±2.6% (12.5±2.6%)
larger for the MIST (and Exeter/Lyon) model, the others are on aver-
age 2.6±1.3% (3.5±1.3%) larger compared to both models. Despite
most of our targets being within the uncertainties in agreement with
the theoretical radii, we observe that they follow the trend of very low
mass stars to be slightly larger than predicted by models. In Fig. 1
we also show the eﬀective temperature of our ﬁve M-dwarfs, the
result from SW21, as well as the same literature sample. Our targets
eﬀective temperatures follow the overall trend of low mass stars. We
note that EBLM J0239-20, similarly to EBLM J1934-42 (blue trian-
gle from SW21) have a slightly higher metallicity ([M/H] > 0.2).
Both stars are slightly larger and cooler, compared to models for stars
with solar metallicity. As shown in Fig. 1 this trend is predicted by
the MIST models for more metal rich stars. But also in this case,
both stars are slightly larger than predicted by models for higher
metallicity stars. Fig. 1 shows three single lined stars from litera-
ture with measured M-dwarf eﬀective temperatures being outliers
of more than 500 K compared to model predictions. These are KIC
1571511B (Oﬁr et al. 2012) as well as SAO 106989 and HD 24465
(Chaturvedi et al. 2018). Populating the low-mass main-sequence
with M-dwarfs having precise eﬀective temperature measurements
will help us to constrain possible trends for low-mass dwarfs. This is
one of the main goals of our CHEOPS programme.

Magnetic activity of the primary star, like spot crossing is not
accounted for in our eclipse model, thus, can aﬀect the size determi-
nations of the M-dwarfs. We used the TESS light curves to search
for variability linked to magnetic activity, like rotational pattern and
ﬂares. No ﬂares have been found in the TESS data set. EBLM J0239-
20 shows a variable modulation of 2-3% close to the orbital period,

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2022)

most probably linked to stellar activity aligned with the rotational
period of the G-dwarf. All our other targets show no or small vari-
ability of less than 1 %. Since we found a good agreement between
the M-dwarf radii in the diﬀerent passbands of TESS and CHEOPS,
we conclude that stellar activity can only have a minor (< 1%) eﬀect
on the derived M-dwarf radius for the ﬁve stars, analysed in this
work. Depending on the actual contrast between the primary star and
the M-dwarf the contribution of the M-dwarf is between 300 and
1200 ppm in CHEOPS data. From this we can exclude large ﬂares
with exceed relative intensities of 25 to 100 % compared to the M-
dwarfs average brightness. M-dwarfs with such ﬂaring activity exist
but account only for about 10 % of the ﬂaring M-dwarfs found in
TESS (Günther et al. 2020). We can assume that the M-dwarf rota-
tion period is synchronised with the orbital period, since the tidal
synchronisation timescale for EBLM systems is about 1 Gyr or less
(Barker 2020). Thus the M-dwarfs are expected to be fast rotators
(P (cid:46) 10 d), which are expected to show enhanced activity levels (e.g.
Morales et al. 2010; Wright et al. 2018). Activity induced photomet-
ric variations, observed for ﬁeld M-dwarfs is typically in the order of
1 % of the M-dwarfs average brightness (Medina et al. 2020). This
results in an expected photometric variability in the order of 10 ppm
for active M-dwarfs which is below the detection eﬃciency in our
data.

Reﬂected light from the primary star (See discussion in Sec 3.3)
can cause an underestimated radius of the M-dwarfs. We note that
this eﬀect is negligible for the ﬁve binaries analysed in this work, as
it would result in a relative underestimation of about 100 ppm of the
M-dwarfs radius for the shortest period binaries in our sample.

5 SUMMARY

Within the framework of our EBLM project, we initiated a CHEOPS
observing programme of 23 low-mass stars to measure precise stellar
parameters as well as eﬀective temperatures. In this paper, we have
analysed high precision CHEOPS light curves of primary and sec-
ondary eclipses for ﬁve eclipsing binaries with low mass companions.
Using the qpower2 transit model, of PYCHEOPS, we ﬁnd an average
uncertainty of 3.2 ± 1.3% for the M-dwarfs radius and 0.4 ± 0.3%
for the M-dwarfs surface gravity. Thus, using precision light curves

allowed us to overcame the larger uncertainties to derive stellar pa-
rameters typically involved with high-resolution spectroscopy. We
have derived the M-dwarfs eﬀective temperature from the contrast
between primary and secondary eclipses and the metallicity from
spectroscopic analysis of the primary star, assuming equal metallic-
ities of both components.

This allows us to compare the M-dwarfs parameters to theoretical
structural models, like the MIST models. We ﬁnd that all our M-
dwarfs are on average larger, but agree within the uncertainty with
the model predictions. This is also true for low-mass M-dwarfs with
enhanced metallicity, which follow the predicted trend of having a
larger radius as well as a cooler eﬀective temperature. Up to now,
the stellar models, as well as our transit model do not include stellar
activity. We have analysed TESS light curves for all our ﬁve targets
and ﬁnd a good (better than 1%) agreement on the M-dwarf radius
in the diﬀerent passband of both instruments. Given the absence of
strong activity indicated variability and ﬂare activity as well as this
good agreement, we conclude that stellar activity does not play a
strong role in the derived uncertainties for our ﬁve stars. This result
is of particular importance for more active stars on our CHEOPS
programme, where activity induced changes in parameters between
the TESS and CHEOPS passbands might need to be accounted for.
We have analysed the dependence of derived M-dwarf parameters
with priors used in the ﬁt. We ﬁnd that limb darkening parameters as
well as orbital parameters like the eccentricity and the argument of
periastron are not well constrained from our model ﬁt. Nevertheless,
we ﬁnd that, other than the limb darkening coeﬃcients, precise orbital
parameters, obtained from radial velocity observations are crucial to
derive M-dwarf radii better than 5%.

Together with SW21, we increased the sample to eight low-mass
stars, with precise measured radii from CHEOPS data. Due to the
fact that the F,G,K-type primary companions are single lined bina-
ries, that allow high-precision orbital characterisation as well as the
determination of precise stellar parameters like metallicity, this sur-
vey, once completed, will allow us to empirically shed light on the
radius inﬂation problem for very low mass stars.
