Abstract. We explore the eﬀects of geometry on the thermal conductivity (κ) of
silicon and germanium nanowires, with lengths between 10-120 nm and diameters up
to 5-6 nm. To this end we perform molecular dynamics simulations with the LAMMPS
software, using Tersoﬀ interatomic potentials. We consider nanowires with polygonal
cross section and we discuss the eﬀect of the transverse geometry on the thermal
conductivity. We also consider tubular (hollow) nanowires and core/shell combinations
of Si/Ge and Ge/Si, and we compare the heat transport of the core/shell structure with
that of the separated core and shell components.

1. Introduction

Semiconductor nanowires have a great potential in several ﬁelds of modern technology,
such as nanoelectronics [1–4], lasers [5], solar cell [6], or thermoelectrics [7]. For many
of these applications understanding the thermal conductivity of nanowires is essential.
Nanoelectronic devices demand a high thermal conductivity and heat sinks to dissipate
heat from nano chips [8], while a low thermal conductivity is important for achieving a
high thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit [9, 10].

Due to the small size and large surface to volume ratio the thermal conductivity
of nanowires is substantially diﬀerent from that of the bulk material. That can be
explained by the limited phonon scattering due to ﬁnite size conﬁnement, by the
increased scattering imposed by the boundary conditions, or by the quantization of
phonon transport. For example, in nanowires of diameter smaller than 20 nm, the
phonon dispersion is modiﬁed due to phonon conﬁnement, causing a signiﬁcant decrease
of the phonon group velocities [11, 12]. Experimentally, it has been reported that the
thermal conductivity of individual single crystalline Si nanowires is more than two orders
of magnitude lower than the bulk value [13]. The geometry plays an important role in
determining the surface to volume ratio of nanowires. Several computational [14–16] and
experimental [17] studies show a relation between heat transport properties of nanowires
and speciﬁc cross-sectional shapes.

including electron and phonon scattering, and
great interest for several properties,
heat and charge current through diﬀerent channels [18–21]. Core/shell nanowires
provide more degrees of freedom for tuning their properties compared to the uniform
nanowires. Core/shell nanowires can also have high carrier mobility [22] and very
low phonon thermal conductance due to the enhancement of surface scattering [16],
which are essential attributes for reaching higher thermoelectric eﬃciency. Previous
studies addressed the eﬀects of surface construction and geometry on nanowires’s
intrinsic electrical conductivity [23], thermal conductivity [24], mechanical [25] and
thermoelectric properties [26]. The growth of semiconductor nanowires with speciﬁc
cross-section is a current research focus in fabrication of nanowires, since many of their
properties depend on the geometry [27, 28], such as hexagonal [29–31], square [32, 33]
and triangular [28, 31, 34] cross-section.

Great eﬀort have been made to study heat transport through core/shell nanowires.
These studies show that a deposition of a thin shell [35], the interface roughness [36]
and depression and localization of long-wavelength phonon modes reduce the thermal
conductivity of nanowires [37]. Also the drastic reduction of thermal conductivity can
be achieved through cross-section modulation [14, 16]. The ﬁnite size eﬀects related to
the length of the nanowire have been obtained for silicon nanowires with square cross-
section and lengths between 6–54 nm [38] and for Si/Ge core/shell nanowire with the
same square geometry [19].

Among the variety of theoretical approaches molecular dynamics (MD) has received
considerable attention for the study of phonon behaviour. This is mainly due to the fact
time-scale and spatial resolution in MD simulation perfectly ﬁts for observation of atomic
vibrations. Since the pioneering work of Green and Kubo [39, 40], several algorithms
for calculating κ within the MD framework have been developed. In the Green-Kubo
approach ensemble average of the instantaneous heat ﬂux auto-correlation is related
to κ through ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. Note that Green-Kubo algorithm does
not require a temperature gradient and thus it is referred to as equilibrium molecular
dynamics (EMD) [41]. The method has been already applied to nanowires of various
polygonal cross-sections and inﬁnite length [42–45]. The lack of temperature gradient
initiated a debate whether EMD method is proper for one-dimensional solids or should
be modiﬁed (cf. Ref. [46] and refs. therein). However, the major problem with EMD
was its computation cost, namely for the auto-correlation function to be convergent.
This motivated the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) approach based on
imposing a temperature gradient and utilizing Fourier’s law to calculate κ. Since
then several studies have been devoted to understanding the origin of diﬀerence in
κ determined by EMD and NEMD approaches (cf. Refs.[46–48]). The temperature
gradient in NEMD is achieved by thermostating hot and a cold segments at diﬀerent
temperatures or adding and removing an equal amount of heat to these segments. Thus,
it is generally believed that NEMD approach mimics better the experimental condition.

However, the NEMD approach often presents a non-linear temperature proﬁle in the
neighborhood of the hot and cold segments. Whether or not the non-linear portions
must be included in determining κ is still an ongoing debate [48]. Besides, the NEMD
approach gives large ﬂuctuations temperature/heat ﬂux unless e.g. imposing a large
temperature gradient to have the heat ﬂux distinguishable from the noise [49]. Then
the large heat ﬂux requires a longer simulation to be converged. M¨uller-Plathe [49]
introduced the reverse-NEMD (rNEMD) approach in which the heat ﬂux is imposed
by exchanging kinetic energy between the hot and cold segments, and produces a
temperature gradient. This way the heat ﬂux is already known from the amount
of exchanged energies. Besides, the rNEMD method conserves the energy and thus
overcomes the dependency on a speciﬁc ensemble.

In the present paper we calculate with MD simulations the heat conductivity of
silicon nanowires with diﬀerent shapes of the cross-section, hollow nanowires, and Si/Ge
core/shell nanowires of triangular shape. We use the rNEMD method to investigate the
thermal conductivity in tubular and core/shell nanowires with diﬀerent geometries of
the cross-section: cylindrical, hexagonal, square, diamond, and triangular. We begin
with a theoretical background of rNEMD in Section 2. Then, Section 3 describes our
model and method to calculate the heat ﬂux and thermal conductivity. In Section 4 we
discuss the thermal conductivity variation with the nanowires length and cross-sectional
geometry, and also the thermal conductivity variation from solid nanowires to tubular
ones with diﬀerent geometries. We also compare the thermal conductivity of Si/Ge and
Ge/Si core/shell nanowires with triangular cross-section. Finally, the conclusions are
reported in Section 5.

2. Theoretical background on the reverse non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics (rNEMD) approach

We use the rNEMD method by M¨uller-Plathe to compute the heat ﬂux and thermal
conductivity of our models of nanowires [49]. In this approach the heat ﬂux density Q
is deﬁned as the amount of energy transferred in a given time through a surface of a
given area which is perpendicular to the ﬂux direction. The thermal conductivity κ is
calculated by Fourier’s law:

Q = −κ∇T ,

(1)

where ∇T is the gradient of the temperature T determined from atomic velocities. If
we take z direction as the direction of the temperature gradient along the nanowire, we
can deﬁne the thermal conductivity as

where t is the simulation time, in practice longer than the relaxation time of the atomic
structure after the initial conditions. In order to make sure the determined κ exactly
belongs to the nanowire axis, the M¨uller-Plathe algorithm requires extra considerations.

The nanowire must be divided into n segments along its axis, n being an odd
integer, and each segment having the same thickness, volume, and number of atoms.

where the sum extends over the Nk atoms contained in Sk, with masses mi, velocity
vectors vi, kB being Boltzmann’s constant. For the case of periodic boundary conditions,
the hot segment is almost located in the middle of the nanowire, corresponding to
S(n/2)+1, and the cold segment is created at the ﬁrst S1. Note that due to the periodic
boundary condition the heat ﬂows from the hot segment to both ends of the wire. The
temperature gradient is produced by exchanging the vi of the most energetic atoms
situated in the S1 with the least energetic atom situated in the S(n+1)/2. Considering
how often the exchange process is performed and how many atoms are included in
each exchange step, one can control ∆T between hot and cold segments. This allows
producing a linear ∆T between the hot and cold segments [49], in contrast to other
NEMD methods. The heat ﬂux per unit area and time is calculated as

where A is cross-sectional area of the wire, counted twice because of of the heat ﬂow in
both directions, from the central hot segment to the lateral cold segments. Assuming
the validity of a linear response (Fourier’s law), the thermal conductivity is calculated
by combining Eqs. (1) and (4).

To check the spatial distribution of the heat ﬂux within the nanowire cross-section
we utilized atomistic values along the nanowire axis. The per-atom heat current (q) is

and ri is its position vector. Although there exist a temperature gradient ∆T , at the
atomistic level we do not need a temperature gradient because d

of per-atom kinetic energy through time. With qi being the microscopic or atomistic
or per-atom value, macroscopic equivalent can be obtained by Qz = (cid:80)

3. The atomistic model

We use silicon and germanium with diamond structure as a model systems in our
simulations. An atomistic model which ignores electron transport can be realistic
for silicon since electrons in the intrinsic (undoped) Si contribute very little to
the heat conduction compared to the phonons. This can be achieved by MD
simulation and solving Newton’s equation of motion. To this end we utilized the large
scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) from Sandia National
Laboratory [51].

The Si nanowires were placed within a orthogonal simulation box that ﬁts the
length of nanowires, but it is several times larger than its diameter in the transverse
directions, as shown in Figures A1 and A2 of the Appendix. We apply ﬁxed boundary
conditions in transverse directions (x and y), and periodic boundary conditions along
the nanowire axis (z direction). A question that might arise here is if our nanowires can
be considered as having inﬁnite length. As pointed out previously [45], and as will be
discussed in the results, κ is dependent on the actual nanowire length included in the
simulation. However, the nanowire length utilized here does not correspond to the real
sample size in experiment. This means that periodic boundary condition can reduce
the ﬁnite size eﬀect, but due to the phonons it can not be completely removed. For
this reason we considered diﬀerent nanowire lengths (10–120 nm) and discuss the issue
further in the results.

The nanowire axis was aligned along the [111] lattice direction that gives (111)
planes at the nanowire cross-section. In order to understand the trade-oﬀ between the
eﬀect of surface area and cross-section area we compared uniform and hollow nanowires
with equal cross-sections. The cavity, or hole, in the hollow nanowires is built with a
central empty channel inside the material and again, we compare diﬀerent geometries
by keeping the transverse area constant. In order to generate the core-shell nanowires
we replaced core atoms with a diﬀerent materials and the entire core-shell was relaxed
to reach equilibrium interatomic distances. This gives an interface similar to that of
hetero epitaxial system.

An important requirement for MD simulation of solid materials is the availability
of accurate interatomic potentials [52]. Several MD simulations studies on thermal
conductivity show strong dependence of these results on the empirical interatomic
potential used [53, 54]. Such potentials have mostly been developed for technologically
important materials, such as silicon and germanium. Among them, the Tersoﬀ potential

Eﬀects of transverse geometry on the thermal conductivity of Si and Ge nanowires

6

[55] and its variants are most commonly used [45, 46]. It is a many-body potential that
allows the description of covalently bonded materials, capturing the quantum mechanical
nature of the bonding, and explicitly incorporating the dependence of the bond order
on local environment. We compared Tersoﬀ potential with the popular Stillinger-Weber
potential and a more recent EDIP potential as well as DFT in determining relevant
thermodynamic properties such as heat capacity. The results are presented in the
Appendix. We utilized Tersoﬀ [56] potential for Si–Si, Ge–Ge and Si–Ge interactions.

We proceed with a two step relaxation process. First, the nanowire is relaxed using
the isothermal–isobaric ensemble (NPT) at the desired equilibrium temperature Teq in
order to allow the atoms to expand until nearly zero stress is achieved along the nanowire
axis, within 50 ps. We utilized Nose-Hoover thermostat to achieve desired temperature
during the relaxation. In the second step, the energy exchange between the hot and
cold regions is performed, in order to develop a stationary temperature proﬁle along
the nanowire axis, for another 50 ps using the microcanonical ensemble (NVE). Note
that NVE allows the average temperature over all segments to remain constant and
equal to Teq. We applied diﬀerent settings for the exchange to produce the temperature
diﬀerences being in the range of 10-60 K between the central and the side segments.
We used the velocity Verlet algorithm for time integration [57, 58] using a time step of
0.5 fs, and ∆T and consequently κ were determined when averaged data points were
converged. We used 103 samples to calculate each of the averaged ∆T points.

In Fig.1 we show the cumulative energy transferred along the cylindrical nanowire
axis fot temmperatures between 50 - 300 K. We can see that heat transfer increases
linearly with respect to the number of time steps, and that is diﬀerent for each
temperature. This is an indication of the fact that steady state temperature proﬁle is
reached and thus we can use Fourier’s formula for calculating the thermal conductivity.
Note that below 50 K the heat ﬂux carried by electrons is comparable with the
contribution of phonons, so studies at lower temperature have to consider and both
electrons and the upper limit of the thermal conductance for phonons. This fundamental
upper limit (a quantum of thermal conductance) is the maximum value of thermal
conductance that an acoustic phonon mode can take [59, 60]. Also at higher
temperatures numerical approaches of Holland’s model (extended Callaway’s model)
can describe thermal conductivity of silicon and germanium up to 1000 K easily [61].

4. Results and discussion

4.1. Length dependence of the thermal conductivity

There are several reports on the dependency of thermal conductivity to the length of
nanowire within MD framework [62, 63]. The Fourier’s law describes thermal transport
in bulk materials, but it is not valid for nanowires with lengths less than phonon mean-
free path. For shorter nanowires (L << λ), it has been shown experimentally that the
thermal conductivity does not have a constant value [64]. The thermal conductivity

variation of these nanowires is strongly related to the temperature regime. At low
temperature where the optical phonons are not excited and thermal current is carried
ballistically by acoustic phonons, thermal conductivity can be described by Landauer
formulation for phonons [65, 66]. Meanwhile for temperature regime higher than 20 K
thermal conductivity is not proportional to the system length and increase non-linearly
with the length due to contribution of both ballistic and diﬀusive phonons [63, 65].

The thermal conductivity of a pure silicon nanowire increases rapidly with nanowire
length below 100 nm. This behavior is in agreement with previous MD studies [38, 67].
The thermal conductivity varies more slowly at higher lengths and reaches a constant
value at lengths over 1000 nm. This slow variation of the thermal conductivity implies
that the nanowire is in the diﬀusive phonon transport regime. The variation of the
thermal conductivity with the length of the nanowire could be understood by considering
a linear variation of the reciprocal of the thermal conductivity with respect to the
reciprocal of the nanowire length, or a power law behavior of the thermal conductivity
with respect to the length.

Considering the temperature regime and nanowires of diﬀerent lengths, we describe
our results with a power law relation. The thermal conductivity increases with respect
to the length of the nanowire according to Lα, where α varies between 0.30-0.48 for
L < 30 nm, and reaches a constant value of 0.56 for 30 nm < L < 150 nm. The
variation of κ with the nanowire length can be understood as the limitation imposed
to contribution of long wavelength phonons. As the nanowire length increases a wider
spectrum of phonons contribute to the calculated heat ﬂux. We study nanowires with
diﬀerent lengths along z direction to see how the thermal conductivity behave when the
length is comparable to the phonon mean free path.

Figure 2. Variation of thermal conductivity for a cylindrical nanowire of 5.5 nm
diameter with length increase

Our calculated thermal conductivity is displayed in Fig. 2, for nanowires with length
L from 10 to 120 nm, having cylindrical shape. We can see a huge increase of the
thermal conductivity by increasing the nanowire length. For instance at 100 K, the
thermal conductivity κ for the 120 nm length nanowire is almost eight times higher
than for the one with 10 nm length.

4.2. Eﬀect of the nanowire cross-section on the thermal conductivity

If we ﬁx the length of nanowires and look at the inﬂuence of the cross-sectional area on
thermal conductivity with respect to temperature, we can see an increase of the thermal
conductivity with increasing the area. Although these variations are not same for each
temperature, the trend is observable. Speciﬁcally at 300 K the thermal conductivity
magnitude increase more than two times by increasing radius of cylindrical nanowires
from 1 nm to 5.5 nm, as shown in Fig. 3.

The dependence of the thermal conductivity and thermoelectric properties of silicon
nanowires on the cross-sectional shape and surface modiﬁcation had been studied before
[23, 24, 26]. In our present study we consider the eﬀect of diﬀerent geometries. We ﬁx
some parameters such as length, cross-sectional area, and the number of atoms in a cross
section, for all shapes, and we only change shape of the nanowire cross section, from
circle to triangle, diamond, hexagon and square. The results are shown in Fig. 4(a).
The thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires is about a factor of two lower than for
bulk silicon [13]. Inelastic surface scattering and ﬁnite size phonon eﬀects contribute to
the low thermal conductivity of nanowires, which is consistent with prior results [26, 68].
Nanowires with square and circle cross-sectional area show very close values of thermal
conductivity, the values for the circular case being slightly larger for all temperatures.

In some studies similar results for square and circle shaped nanowires had been reported
[16, 68, 69]. In our study the nanowires with triangular cross-section area (with a ﬁxed
area of 24 nm2) have the highest thermal conductivity of all shapes. Below that, the
next values correspond to diamond and hexagon.

ﬂat surfaces present in this geometry. Or, the presence of many edges, or corners of
the cross section, reduce the conductivity.
In other words, the thermal conductivity
increases with increasing the surface-to-volume ratio, or perimeter-to-area ratio of the
cross section, because our nanowires have all the same length. Since the cross sectional
area A of all shapes is also the same, the smallest ratio corresponds to the cylinder
(3.5/
A), and
triangle (4.6/
A). Our thermal conductivities obey this order, except for the the square
case. Our interpretation of this exception is related to the unit cell of the material
(diamond), which does not accommodate well in the square cross section of a nanowire
with its length in the [111] direction. In Figure A1 of the Appendix one can see a zigzag
distribution of the surface atoms in the square case. The corner-to-corner distance for
the square nanowire is thus smaller than for atoms with a better alignment, like in the
other geometries, and the eﬀective surface-to-volume ratio for the square geometry is
actually smaller than expected. To understand better this situation, we tried to change
step-wise the corner angles of the diamond shape in order to observe the evolution of
the thermal conductivity to the results for the square shape. However, for many shapes
in between diamond and square the relaxed structures had irregular surfaces and the
results for the thermal conductivity were not stable. We believe this is an additional
indication of the geometrical mismatch between the nanowire geometry and the unit
cell, at least at this small scale considered in our work.

4.3. Hollow nanowires

We are modeling tubular nanowires by omitting atoms from the nanowire center, and see
a huge decrease of the thermal conductivity values for all shapes. That is predictable due
to the increase of the surface to volume ratio. The consequence is phonon conﬁnement
and enhanced phonon scattering, leading to lowering of the thermal conductivity in
the tubular nanowires in comparison with uniform nanowires.
In the next phase by
considering the same cross-sectional area, number of atoms, and nanowire length, this
time we increase the empty space inside the nanowire material. Explicitly the thermal
conductivity decreases with increasing the nanowire radius, as shown in Fig. 5 for the
circular and triangular cases. All the other shapes show same behavior. The larger radii
(both internal and external) leads to lower thermal conductivity. The reduction for the
triangular cross section can be more than 50%, which is the largest eﬀect for all studied
shapes.

Figure 5. The thermal conductivity vs. temperature with increasing the hollow space
inside the nanowires with (a) cylindrical and (b) triangular prismatic shapes. The shell
area ≈ 24 nm2 and the length L = 30 nm are same for all cases.

Next, in Fig. 6 we show a snapshot of the average of the heat ﬂux along the nanowire
axis for triangular nanowires, both with compact and hollow geometry, at temperature
100 K. The averaged heat ﬂux was obtained by averaging over both time and half length
of nanowire i.e. where slope of the temperature proﬁle does not change sign. The color
bar indicates the heat ﬂux in eV/atom.fs units. It can be seen that there is no obvious
heat channel and the distribution of heat ﬂux ﬂuctuate around a uniform value, within
the nanowire cross section, for both geometries. Strictly speaking, however, it seems
larger ﬂux passes through the nanowire core in the absence of the hollow space. So with
the empty space in the center of the nanowires we omit the main heat ﬂux through its
core, which leads to a lower thermal conductivity.

4.4. Core/shell nanowires

Core/shell nanoscale structures allow additional possibilities to engineer the thermal
transport, via phonon scattering mechanisms. The control of phonon interference at
the interface between the core and the shell, and the phonon scattering in diﬀerent
geometries, makes core/shell nanowires a promising candidate for heat transport at
nanoscale.
In principle, the thermal conductivity of independent parallel nanowires
should always be larger than the conductivity of each individual nanowire (as in the case
of electrical conductivity). But for a core/shell nanowire, with two diﬀerent materials in
contact, it is more diﬃcult to calculate the thermal conductivity, in order to incorporate
the eﬀects of the stress along the common interface, and the diﬀerent phonon group
velocities in each material.

conductivity, we performed three series of simulations. First the thermal conductivities
for Si/Ge core/shell nanowires, between temperatures 50-300 K, were calculated for all
cross sectional shapes. And then, the thermal conductivities for hollow and uniform
nanowires, corresponding to the shell and core separated from each other, but using the
same cross sectional area, number of atoms, and length, as for the core/shell structures.

both core and shell nanowires, respectively Si/Ge core/shell total cross sectional area is
49 nm2.

For understanding the thermal conductivity variation for each shape, we calculate
the average thermal conductivity of the core (κc) and shell (κs) nanowires, κave =
(κc+κs)/2, for each speciﬁc shape, and we compare it with the true thermal conductivity
of the Si/Ge core/shell nanowire of that shape (κ). The meaning of κave is the thermal
conductivity of the core/shell nanowire if the core and the shell would behave like
independent heat transport channels (both core and shell have the same cross-sectional
area). The thermal conductivities for the core, shell, and core/shell cases, and the
corresponding deviation (κave − κ)/κ are reported in Table 1, for temperature 100 K.
In all cases the true core/shell value κ is smaller than the average value, indicating that
the interface between the core and the shell reduces the heat transport. We see that for
the square and circular cross sections these diﬀerences are the smallest, less than 2%.
The largest diﬀerence is again for the triangle, and then for the diamond.

cross section, if coated with a Ge thin layer, was already reported in the literature
[19]. This eﬀect can be explained by the strong reduction of phonon group velocities in
core/shell nanowires due to the redistribution of phonon energy spectra and mixing of
high-velocity phonons from silicon with low-velocity phonons from germanium [70]. Here
we ﬁnd out that the reduction can be larger for other geometries, especially for those
with large surface-to-volume ratio, like in the triangular case. The high deviation from
average thermal conductivity κave values for triangle shape can be created by phonon
conﬁnement eﬀects imposed by the geometry. Due to this reason we chose the triangle
shape for performing further simulations.

In the next phase of simulations for the Si/Ge case, the Si core cross-sectional area
is 5.2 nm2 and the Ge shell is 23.5 nm2, and lengths of both core and shell are 120 nm.
In the Ge/Si case we use the same numbers of atoms for the core and shell, with the
two materials exchanged. Note that due to the diﬀerent lattice constant of Si and Ge,
reaching exactly same area for two shapes is impossible but the total diﬀerence in whole
volumetric size is near 2%. This diﬀerence had been included in calculation of thermal
conductivity.

In Fig. 7 (a) we show the thermal conductivity vs.

temperature of the Si/Ge
example. Despite having less atoms in the Si core than in the Ge shell, the isolated Si
core shows higher thermal conductivity than the isolated Ge shell, as can also be seen
in Table. 1. This is because of two main reasons. First, the hole inside the tubular
Ge nanowire lead to a large reduction of the thermal conductivity, because of the large
surface to volume ratio and consequently intense phonons scattering. Second, in general
Si nanowires have higher thermal conductivity than Ge nanowires with similar geometric
parameters [70, 71]. The depression of the vibrational density of states of Si atoms on
the surface with the addition of Ge shell atom leads to the reduction of the thermal
conductivity of Si/Ge nanowire with respect to the Si core alone, as already shown
by Hu et al.[19]. However, now we observe that the diﬀerence between the average
conductivity (κave) and the true value for the core/shell structure become smaller with
increasing the temperature, and reverse order for temperatures about 170 K.

In Fig.7 (b) we show the Ge/Si core/shell case, where the thermal conductivity of
this structure is larger than for the Ge and Si separated components. Despite the hole in
the Si shell, which reduces the thermal conductivity if we compare it to the solid one, it
still remains larger than the thermal conductivity of the Ge core. Because of this, Ge/Si
core/shell nanowires shows higher thermal conductivity than Si/Ge in all temperature
regime. This inequality has been obtained before for the square geometry [14, 70]. This
diﬀerence is not huge because despite carrying large amount of heat through both core
and shell in Ge/Si core/shell nanowires, we still have shell atoms depressing over core
atoms from vibrational states.

5. Conclusions

We have studied the thermal conductivity of solid and tubular silicon nanowires with
diﬀerent cross-sectional area, lengths and geometries. For silicon nanowires the thermal
conductivity increases linearly by increasing the cross sectional area, and increases with a
power law in the length of nanowires. By considering the same length and cross sectional
area for all silicon nanowires with diﬀerent cross sectional geometries, the square shape
shows the lowest thermal conductivity value and the triangular shape shows the highest
value. Due to the increased surface to volume ratio, making an empty space inside
nanowire, i.e. making a tubular nanowire, always leads to a decrease of the thermal
conductivity. Tubular nanowires with thinner walls show less thermal conductivity and
for the triangular shape the thermal conductivity decreases much more than for other
geometries when the nanowires become thinner.

We also calculated the thermal conductivity of core/shell Si/Ge and Ge/Si
In this case, due to phonon scattering at the interface between the
nanowires.
two materials, the thermal conductivity of the nanowire is diﬀerent from a simple
combination of the core and shell thermal conductivity values calculated separately.

By considering the same geometry parameters, but exchanging the materials order
in core and shell (Ge/Si instead of Si/Ge), we can see a diﬀerent thermal conductivity.
Using nanowires of a speciﬁc geometry, and combining diﬀerent materials, may be a
promising way to engineer the heat transport at nanoscale.

Appendix A. More on methodology

Comparison of popular force ﬁelds for predicting thermal properties of the bulk Si with
that of ab-initio method. Here we brieﬂy describe the method and simulation detail for
calculation of these properties.

Appendix A.1. Simulation cell

Fig. A1 and A2 show the perspective view of some nanowires utilized in the present
study those have the same cross-section area. The black box indicates simulation cell and
vacuum around the nanowires in transverse direction. The illustrations were obtained

considered to be parallel to to [111] orientation of diamond lattice. This gives (111)
palnes in the nanowire cross-section. As can be seen in the ﬁgures, triangle, hexagonal
and diamond cross-section adjust very well with the (111) plane i.e. they give atomically
smooth and faceted surfaces around the nanowire. However, four-fold symmetry does
not exist in the (111) plane and thus for the square cross-section only horizontal surfaces
become smooth surface.

Appendix A.2. First principles

In the ﬁrst principles approaches, plane wave projector augmented wave method [72]
was utilized within density functional theory framework as implemented in the VASP
code [73]. The generalized gradient approximation of Perdew Burke Ernzerhof [74] was
utilized as exchange correlation potential. We used a plane-wave energy cutoﬀ of 500 eV.
The reciprocal space of diamond structure was sampled by 16×16×16 k-point mesh. The
radial cutoﬀs of the PAW potentials of Si was 1.01 ˚A. The 3s and 3p electrons of Si were
treated as valence and the remaining electrons were kept frozen. The Brillouin zones
of the unit cells were sampled by a 16x16x2 k-point mesh, and the Methfessel-Paxton
scheme [75] with a smearing width of 0.4 eV was employed.

Appendix A.3. Force ﬁeld

The general Tersoﬀ [55] potential takes the following form:

U (rij) = fc(rij)[Aij exp(−λijrij) − bijBij exp(−αijrij)]

(A1)

with Aij, Bij, λij and αij being ﬁtting parameters and fc being the smoothing function
that works near the cuoﬀs. The main bond order term of Tersoﬀ potential is bij that
changes the attraction based on the bond angle, number of nearest neighbors and their
symmetry

bij = [1 + (βζij)n]− 1

here α, β, n, m, c, d, and h are ﬁtting constants.
It is worth mentioning that this
is the general formalism of Tersoﬀ potential and some of these parameters are known
constants depending on the speciﬁc formalism.

Appendix A.4. Phonons

Phonon calculations were performed by the supercell approach. Real-space force
constants of supercells were calculated in the density-functional perturbation theory
(DFPT) implemented in the VASP code [76], and phonon frequencies were calculated
from the force constants using the PHONOPY code [77]. Thermodynamic properties
were calculated using the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). For the QHA
calculations, supercells containing 4×4×4 unit cells.
It is worth mentioning that
the diﬀerence between the DFPT the Parlinski-Li-Kawazoe method [78] with a ﬁnite
displacement is negligible. However, the diﬀerence between supercell sizes increase with
increasing temperature. For instance, the energy diﬀerences between 1×1×1 and 4×4×1
supercells, at 1000 K is several hundreds of meV/unit cell [79].

Appendix A.5. Thermodynamic properties

According to QHA the thermal properties of solids at constant volume can be calculated
from their phonon density of states as a function of frequencies [79]. The phonon
contribution to the Helmholtz free energy Fphonon is given by

and the reduced Planck constant, respectively.

In practical thermodynamical problems related to solids, the thermal properties
need to be known at constant pressure. They can be calculated from the previous
quantities through thermodynamic relationship. The Gibbs free energy (G) may be
written as

G(T, P ) = min

V

[U (V ) + Fphonon(T ; V ) + P V ],

(A8)

where V and P are the volume and pressure, respectively, and U (V ) is the total energy
of electronic structure at constant volume. The right-hand side of Eq. (A8) means that,

Eﬀects of transverse geometry on the thermal conductivity of Si and Ge nanowires 18

for each couple of T and P variables, the function inside the square brackets is minimized
with respect to the volume. Then the heat capacity at constant pressure is derived from
G(T, P ) by

Appendix A.6. Comparison of diﬀerent interatomic potentials

Fig. A3 shows the comparison of various thermodynamic properties obtained by two
popular (SW and Tersoﬀ) potentials with a more recent EDIP potential and DFT
results. The bulk modulus (E) is calculated by ﬁtting attractive regions of energy
vs. volume (E-V) curves (E-V curves are not shown here). Rest of the plots were
calculated from phonon dispersion obtained by supercell approach within second
harmonic approximation theorem. It can be seen that Gibbs free energy and E and
heat capacity obtained by Tersoﬀ potential shows better agreement with DFT results
compared to that of SW. The only exception is thermal expansion coeﬃcient (α) in
which SW potential predicts closer results to that of DFT. At elevated temperatures
EDIP potential predicts increasing trend of the bulk elastic modulus and consequently
underestimates α. At temperatures below 130 K, DFT results indicates negative α that
is not predicted by interatomic potential.
