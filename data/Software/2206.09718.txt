Abstract—The modeling and analysis of superconducting coils
is an essential task in the design stage of most devices based
on high-temperature superconductors (HTS). These calculations
allow verifying basic estimations and assumptions, proposing
improvements, and computing quantities that are not easy to
calculate with an analytical approach. For instance, the es-
timation of losses in HTS is fundamental during the design
stage since losses can strongly inﬂuence the cooling system
requirements and operating temperature. Typically, 2D ﬁnite
element analysis is used to calculate AC losses in HTS, due
to the lack of analytical solutions that can accurately represent
complex operating conditions such as AC transport current and
AC external applied magnetic ﬁeld in coils. These 2D models
are usually a representation of an inﬁnitely long arrangement.
Therefore, they cannot be used to analyze end effects and
complex 3D conﬁgurations. In this publication, we use the
homogenization of the T-A formulation in 3D for the analysis
of superconducting coils with complex geometries where a 2D
approach can not provide accurate analyses and veriﬁcation
of assumptions. The modeling methodology allows an easier
implementation in commercial software (COMSOL Multiphysics)
in comparison with the currently available 3D H homogenization,
despite the complexity of the geometry. This methodology is ﬁrst
validated with a racetrack coil (benchmark case) by comparing
the results with the well-established H formulation. Then, the
electromagnetic behavior of coils with more complex geometries
is analyzed.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE electrical properties of high-temperature supercon-

ductors (HTS) inspired several applications in different
ﬁelds such as electrical machines [1], [2], [3]; fault current
limiters [4]; magnets for scientiﬁc research [5]; energy stor-
age [6] and transmission [7]. The design of these devices usu-
ally require an electromagnetic analysis that allows verifying
rated characteristics (i.e., power, torque, efﬁciency) as well
as studying the behavior under different operating conditions.
Moreover, losses in the superconducting tapes and wires must
be estimated to design the cooling system. These AC losses
can be decisive for the practical and economic realization of
superconducting devices.

Several analytical solutions were developed to estimate
[9], and inﬁnite stacks of

in HTS tapes

[8],

losses

these solutions are only
tapes [10], [11], [12]. However,
valid under speciﬁc operating conditions such as AC transport
current or applied uniform magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, they can
not be directly used to estimate losses in most superconducting
machines and equipment. For these reasons, a ﬁnite-element
model is typically used to analyze the electromagnetic behav-
ior and estimate losses in the HTS tapes.

There are two popular formulations of Maxwell’s equations
that are commonly used to model superconductors by using
the ﬁnite-elements method (FEM). The ﬁrst one is based
on the magnetic ﬁeld strength ( (cid:126)H) and was already used to
study numerous applications [13], [14]. The second one was
introduced in [15] and is based on the current vector potential
( (cid:126)T ) and magnetic vector potential ( (cid:126)A). This T-A formulation
is mostly used to analyze superconducting layers by apply-
ing a thin strip approximation. The approximation allows a
reduction of dimensions that decreases the number of degrees
of freedom and computation time. Therefore, it was used to
study the cross-section of magnets [5] and electrical machines
with hundreds and thousands of tapes [16], [17], [18], [19].

Most of the FEM-based models used to study superconduct-
ing devices are 2D. They usually represent the cross-section of
an inﬁnite long or axisymmetric arrangement. Therefore, the
end effects are not considered. Moreover, complex geometries
and operating conditions such as saddle coils and twisted
stacks of tapes under an external magnetic ﬁeld can not be ana-
lyzed with a 2D model. For these reasons, several efforts were
made for the development of tools and methodologies that
allow 3D modeling of HTS coils [20], [21], [22], [23], [24].
As part of these efforts, in 2014 the 3D H homogenization was
introduced with the model of a racetrack coil [25]. However,
this approach requires the implementation of high resistivity
layers in the homogenized domain. Five years later, the 3D
homogenized T-A formulation was proposed by Huang et
al. [26], who used it to calculate the AC transport losses of
HTS racetrack coils.

In this work, we expand the current knowledge by using
the homogenization of the T-A formulation for the simulation
of complex 3D HTS coils. The modeling approach is based
on normal vectors deﬁned by a local curvilinear coordinate
system that considers the continuous shape and position of
the tape and coil. Therefore, this general deﬁnition allows an
easy implementation of the model despite the complexity of
the geometry. The dependence of the critical current density
on the magnetic ﬂux density magnitude and direction can be
taken into account by using the projection of the magnetic ﬁeld
in the direction of the unit vectors of the curvilinear system.
In this publication, we ﬁrst describe the derivation of the

governing equations in section II, with particular emphasis on
the implementation of the normal vectors and how they can be
deﬁned in a commercial software (COMSOL Multiphysics). In
the second place, we describe the HTS tape that was used in all
the simulations (section III). Then, we validate the modeling
approach with a racetrack coil geometry that is considered a
benchmark case (section IV), by comparing the results with
the well-established H formulation [25]. After the validation,
the model and analysis of more complex geometries are
introduced: saddle coil (section V), D-shape coil (section VI),
and twisted coil (section VII). Finally, the main conclusions
of this work are summarized in section VIII.

II. T-A FORMULATION AND HOMOGENIZATION

In this section, we ﬁrst present a small review of the T-A
formulation and homogenization to set the basis that allows
us to extend these concepts to 3D complex geometries. Then,
the 3D T-A homogenization is explained based on unit vectors
that are perpendicular to the ﬂat face of the tape, and can be
deﬁned from the geometry of the coil.

A. T-A formulation

The ﬁrst applications of the T-A formulation to study
superconducting devices by using FEM were introduced
in [15], [27]. These works presented the T-A formulation as
an efﬁcient approach to model HTS tapes with a high aspect
ratio.

This formulation of Maxwell’s equations couples the current
vector potential (cid:126)T and magnetic vector potential (cid:126)A, which are
deﬁned by the current density (cid:126)J and magnetic ﬂux density (cid:126)B:

(cid:126)J = ∇ × (cid:126)T

(cid:126)B = ∇ × (cid:126)A.

(1)

(2)

The magnetic vector potential is computed in all the do-
mains under study by using Maxwell-Ampere’s law (µ is the
relative permeability of the material):

∇ × (

1
µ

∇ × (cid:126)A) = (cid:126)J.

(3)

The current vector potential is calculated only in the super-

conducting domain by using Maxwell-Faraday’s law:

∇ × (ρHTS∇ × (cid:126)T ) = −

∂ (cid:126)B
∂t

.

(4)

The resistivity of the superconducting material is typically

modeled with a power-law (cid:126)E − (cid:126)J relation [29]:

An approximation is done by considering that the supercon-
ducting layer in the tapes under study (for instance rare-earth
barium copper oxide/REBCO tapes) has a very large width-
to-thickness ratio. Therefore, we can collapse the thickness
of the tape (δ) as shown in ﬁgure 1. As a consequence, the
current is able to ﬂow only in a superconducting sheet and
(cid:126)T is always perpendicular to this sheet. For this reason, the
current vector potential can be expressed as T · (cid:126)n ((cid:126)n is a unit
vector perpendicular to the superconducting layer) [15].

The transport current can be imposed by setting the bound-
ary conditions for T at the edges of the tape, as it is shown
in equations (6) and (7):

In this publication, we use the order of the elements for
discretization described in [28] (linear elements for (cid:126)T and
quadratic elements for (cid:126)A) to avoid possible spurious oscil-
lations.

B. Homogenization in 3D

The homogenization technique assumes that the supercon-
ducting tapes that are wound in coils can be represented by an
anisotropic bulk that can reproduce the overall electromagnetic
behavior of the coil [30]. This allows reducing the number
of degrees of freedom and the computation time. The tech-
nique was implemented by using the T-A formulation in 2D
in [28], [31]. Therefore, we follow a similar approach to extend
the homogenization into the 3D analysis of superconducting
coils.

The procedure is summarized in ﬁgure 2. We start from
the arrangement of tapes modeled in the T-A 3D formulation
as sheets and deﬁne a cell unit around them (with the same
height of the superconducting tape and thickness Λ). The main
characteristics of the tape will be impressed in this cell unit to
transform the stack of tapes into a block. The scaled current
in the homogenized bulk is deﬁned for the (cid:126)A calculation as:

plane then:

If the tape is wound in a circular shape with the center in the
origin, then (cid:126)n will be parallel to the radial vector in cylindrical
coordinates ˆρ:

In principle, the homogenization makes use of Maxwell’s
equations in the same way as the 3D T-A formulation.
Therefore, we keep the thin strip approximation of the tape
that allows reducing the current vector potential into a scalar
quantity. This means that even if the tapes are replaced by
a homogeneous bulk, the current can only ﬂow in the plane
parallel to the original superconducting sheets. For example,
in the zoom presented in the bottom left corner of ﬁgure 2,
the current can only have Jy and Jz components and the
current vector potential only has a Tx component. The new
homogenized block can be seen as a highly compressed group
of superconducting tapes. To represent a general geometry, we

The magnetic vector potential is calculated in all the do-

superconducting domain by using Maxwell-Faraday’s law:

where (cid:126)n can be easily determined in the T-A formulation
because it is the vector perpendicular to the superconducting
sheet. Therefore, it is usually deﬁned by default in commercial
software like COMSOL Multiphysics. However, once the stack
of tapes is replaced, it is not easy to deﬁne (cid:126)n inside the bulk.
We have no longer a reference surface from which we can
deﬁne the normal vector. A similar issue can be found in the
2D T-A homogenization when complex (rotated or curved)
cross-sections are modeled in 2D. In this work, we present
two alternatives to address this issue. First, we can analytically
calculate (cid:126)n by following the geometrical path of the tape

Fig. 3. Curvilinear coordinate (CC) system example for the geometry shown
in ﬁgure 2. The CC system is deﬁned based on the surface/boundaries of
the 3D domain, which allows the deﬁnition of the base (unit) vectors of the
system. These vectors can be used as references of the directions perpendicular
to the wide face of the tape (e⊥), parallel to the wide face of the tape (e(cid:107)),
and tangential to the winding direction (et).

The normal vector can also be analytically deﬁned by
domains to represent more complex geometries as the one
shown in the right corner of ﬁgure 2. In this case, (cid:126)n = ˆi in the
straight section and (cid:126)n = ˆρ in the circular one. However, these
analytic expressions can become very complex if we change
the geometry of the coil, for example by introducing twisted
or curved non-circular sections. Therefore, a second and more
general solution is a curvilinear coordinate system deﬁned in
the superconducting domain. This approach creates a local
coordinate system with curved lines that follow the shape
of the superconducting domain [32], as it can be observed
in ﬁgure 3 for the geometry described in ﬁgure 2. The unit
vectors of this local coordinate system can be deﬁned for
all possible geometries and used as normal/tangential vectors.
This approach can be implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics
by using the curvilinear coordinate module.

Finally, we have to establish the boundary conditions to
solve our problem. The homogenized bulk represents a densely
packed group of HTS sheets. Each one of these sheets should
transport the same current as its original counterpart [28].
Therefore, we apply Dirichlet boundary conditions to the
upper and lower gray boundaries as expressed in equation (7)

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. X, MONTH 20XX

and apply Neumann boundary conditions to the internal and
external boundaries:

straight part of the coil. According to this approach and the
average criterion, the critical current of the coil is 100 A.

III. DESCRIPTION OF THE HTS TAPE

The normal vector ((cid:126)n) can be deﬁned in this case by
domain by following the original path of the superconducting
tape or by using a curvilinear coordinate system, as it was
mentioned in section II. We used both approaches in this
case and obtained identical results. For this reason, we only
present in this publication the results of the model that uses
the curvilinear coordinate system.

Fig. 4. Critical current density behavior of the HTS tape for an external
magnetic ﬁeld magnitude of 50 mT, 100 mT, 150 mT and 200 mT. An
angle of 0° represents a ﬁeld perpendicular to the wide face of the tape; an
angle of 90° represents a parallel one.

The HTS tape used in all the simulations that we present
in this publication is the one reported in [25]. This allows
direct comparison and validation of the modeling approach
with the well-established 3D H homogenization. The critical
current density dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld amplitude
and direction is described by the following equation:

Jc(B(cid:107), B⊥) =

(cid:113)

(cid:104)

(14)

where B(cid:107) and B⊥ are the parallel and perpendicular compo-
nents of the magnetic ﬂux density, and the parameters Jc0,
k, Bc and b have the following values 49 GA m−2, 0.275,
32.5 mT and 0.6 [25]. This is a tape with a critical current
(Ic) of 160 A at 77 K self-ﬁeld. The behavior of the critical
current density described in (14) can be better appreciated in
ﬁgure 4, where Jc(B(cid:107), B⊥) was plotted by considering four
different magnetic ﬁeld magnitudes with different directions.

IV. RACETRACK COIL MODEL AND ANALYSIS

In this section, we study the racetrack coil presented in [25].
This kind of coil is used for example in the rotor of supercon-
ducting electrical machines for wind turbine applications [33].
They have two straight and two round parts as shown in
ﬁgure 5, where the dimensions of the racetrack coil under
analysis are also given. The critical current of the coil was
estimated by using the methodology described in [34] in a 2D
model that represents the cross-section of the middle of the

Fig. 5. Geometry and dimensions of the racetrack coil under study [25]. The
coil is made with 50 turns of HTS tape, which creates a stack 4 mm wide
and 20 mm height in the cross-section of the coil. All the dimensions are in
millimeters.

We assume in this section the same parameters presented
in [25] to model the superconducting tape. Similar to what
was done in [25], we modeled only one-eighth of the coil by
taking advantage of the symmetries.

The critical current density dependence on the magnetic
ﬁeld magnitude and direction was modeled by using the
parallel (B(cid:107)) and perpendicular (B⊥) components of the
magnetic ﬂux density [25]. For this reason, these components
were also calculated by domain. In the circular section, they
were computed as B(cid:107) = Bz and B⊥ = Bρ, by assuming that
the circular region is centered at the origin. In the straight
section, they were computed as B(cid:107) = Bz and B⊥ = Bx, by
considering that the straight region is parallel to the y axis.

The normalized current density in the cross-sections of
the racetrack coil for AC transport current (f = 50 Hz and
Ipeak = 100 A) without external magnetic ﬁeld, when the
current is equal to zero (after the ﬁrst half period of the
sinusoidal cycle), is shown in ﬁgure 6. In this ﬁgure we can
also observe a comparison of the normalized current density
distribution obtained with the 3D H homogenization and 3D
T-A homogenization, at the middle of the straight and circular
sections. The current density distribution obtained by using
the 3D T-A homogenization is in good agreement with the
one computed with the 3D H homogenization, and it is similar
along the coil. We only observed a small difference between
the middle of the straight and circular sections when the
current is close to its maximum value, as it was reported
in [25]. Figure 7 shows the losses due to AC transport
current estimated with the 3D T-A homogenization model. The
results are in good agreement with the 3D H homogenization
calculation for all the studied current values, with a maximum
relative error lower than 2 %.

The main advantage of the 3D T-A homogenization is that it
is relatively easy to implement. In particular, it does not require

of the coil are presented in ﬁgure 8. Only one-fourth of the coil
was modeled by taking advantage of the symmetries. As it was
done in the previous section, the critical current was estimated
with a 2D model by following the procedure described in [34]
and using the average criterion. The critical current of the
coil is 100 A. This critical current was veriﬁed with a 3D
simulation where the current of the coil was ramped up
(100 A s−1) until the critical current of the tape was reached.
In this simulation, we saw at 100 A the full penetration of the
coil with critical current density, and a change of the slope in
the instantaneous losses which represents the operational limit
established by the critical current.

This type of coil is used in the magnet sector and was
proposed for the rotor and stator of superconducting electrical
machines, where a proper inclination of the straight section can
lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in AC losses [35], [36], [37].
Two operating conditions are analyzed in this section, AC
transport current with and without AC externally applied
magnetic ﬁeld.

made with 50 turns of HTS tape, which creates a stack 4 mm wide and 20 mm
high in the cross-section of the coil. All the dimensions are in millimeters.

A. AC transport current without magnetic ﬁeld

The AC transport current (without external magnetic ﬁeld)
operating condition is easier to analyze for this complex
geometry. Therefore, it was chosen as the ﬁrst step in the
analysis of the coil. Since this is a non-planar coil, the current

homogenization and the H 3D homogenization.

2D integral constraints or high resistivity zones to prevent
current sharing between subdomains of different groups of
tapes. This restriction, which is quite tricky to implement in the
3D H homogenization [25], is included in the essence of the
T-A homogenization by applying the thin strip approximation
which constraints the current to ﬂow in the plane parallel
to the tape and allows reducing the current vector potential
into a scalar quantity. Moreover, the proposed normal vector
approach (based on a curvilinear coordinate system deﬁnition)
allows simulating any geometrical arrangement. Therefore, it
represents an effective and practical tool for the analysis of
complex geometries.

V. SADDLE COIL MODEL AND ANALYSIS

Since the modeling technique was already validated in the
previous section, we can proceed with the analysis of more
complicated geometries that are currently being investigated
for the development of superconducting devices.

The second case of study is a saddle coil. This is a non-
planar coil with two straight and two curved parts, which allow
a 90° rotation of the cross-section between the middle of the
circular and the straight region. The geometry and dimensions

vector has x-component, y-component and z-component (
ﬁgure 9). In the middle of the straight section, the current
ﬂows parallel to the x-axis. The curved section works as a
transition zone for the current vector from the x-direction to
the y-direction, by following the winding and position of the
tapes. Due to the complex behavior of the current density ( (cid:126)J)
in 3D geometries, the cartesian components (Jx, Jy, Jz) are
not suitable for representation purposes. A possible way to
overcome this problem is to use the norm of (cid:126)J. However, we
would not be able to appreciate the two fronts of currents in
opposite directions during the AC cycle. Therefore, we use
the dot product between the current density vector and the
tangential vector parallel to the winding direction ((cid:126)et):

(15)

(cid:126)J (cid:5) (cid:126)et
Jc(B(cid:107), B⊥)

.

The dot product between this unit vector, parallel to the
longitudinal direction of the tape, and the current density
keeps the same module and direction of (cid:126)J, by having a
positive/negative value when the current density is in the
same/opposite direction of (cid:126)et. The parallel and perpendicular
(to the wide face of the tape) components of the magnetic
ﬁeld required for the local computation of Jc(B(cid:107), B⊥) can
also be calculated in a more general expression with the dot
product between the magnetic ﬁeld and the other two unit
(base) vectors associated to the deﬁnition of the curvilinear
coordinate system:

B(cid:107) = (cid:126)B (cid:5) (cid:126)e(cid:107)

B⊥ = (cid:126)B (cid:5) (cid:126)e⊥.

(17)

In ﬁgure 10 we represent the current density behavior in
the coil for an AC transport current with a peak value of
100 A and frequency f = 50 Hz, when the current is equal
to zero, and after the ﬁrst half period of the sinusoidal cycle.
The current density penetration and behavior is very similar in
the middle of the straight and circular sections. There is only
a very small difference between the inner and the outer part of
the curved section, indicated with green arrows as A and B in
ﬁgure 10. This small difference is an effect of the self-ﬁeld of
the coil, which tends to be higher inside the coil than outside.
According to these results, a 2D model that represents the
middle of the straight section of the saddle coil can provide
a good approximation of the current density behavior and a
ﬁrst estimation of the AC losses. This bi-dimensional model
is simpler, faster, and easier to implement; and is commonly
used to have ﬁrst estimations of important parameters such as
AC losses and magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, we decided to build
the 2D model to verify whether this assumption is valid for
the proposed case study.

Figure 11 shows the current density behavior obtained with
the 2D model that represents the middle of the straight section
of the coil, for the same operating point and condition used
in ﬁgure 10. The current density behavior is similar between
the 2D and 3D models for the straight part of the coil. In
the curved section, there is a small difference. As mentioned
before, this difference is related to the self-ﬁeld in 3D, which
is a result of the interaction of the different parts (straight and
curved) of the coil and can not be taken into account by a 2D
model.

Figure 12 presents the behavior of the AC transport losses
calculated with the T-A 3D and 2D homogenized models.
The losses estimated with both models are in good agreement
for all the range of current amplitudes under analysis, with a
maximum relative difference of 8.4 %. The small differences
noticed in the current density in the curved section do not
have a meaningful impact on the AC transport losses. These
differences vanish in the behavior of the whole coil, where
the straight part behavior is dominant in the AC transport

critical current density by using equation (15) to reﬂect the two fronts of
current (positive and negative) in the direction tangential to the winding.

losses. These results conﬁrm the aforementioned hypothesis.
The 2D model can be used as a ﬁrst estimation of important
parameters such as AC transport current losses for this speciﬁc
case. However, the magnetic ﬁeld around the coils in most of
the practical applications is a combination of self-ﬁeld and
interaction with the environment. This yields a more complex
operating condition that a 2D model can not fully predict.

B. AC Transport current and AC external magnetic ﬁeld

In this sub-section, we analyze the behavior of the saddle
coil in the case of AC transport current (with a peak value
of 100 A and frequency f = 50 Hz) and AC external mag-
netic ﬁeld. The external magnetic ﬁeld is uniform, sinusoidal
(100 mT in magnitude and frequency f = 50 Hz) and applied
in the z-direction, in phase with the magnetic ﬁeld produced

and the 2D T-A homogenization model that considers the cross-section of the

by the coil. This can be seen as the magnetic ﬁeld produced by
the rotor of an electrical machine that reaches one of the stator
superconducting coils. However,
the magnetic ﬁeld in the
stator of a superconducting electrical machine is more complex
than the presented operating condition. In an electrical ma-
chine, the magnetic ﬁeld changes around the stator and is not
necessary sinusoidal in time (it depends on the properties of
the materials, the machine and coil design...) [37]. Therefore,
the case presented in this subsection is a simpliﬁed version of a
more complex operating condition, which allows us to study
the behavior of the coil with AC transport current and AC
external magnetic ﬁeld. The analysis is not intended to predict
the behavior of the coil in an electrical machine environment.
Since the external magnetic ﬁeld is in the z-direction and
in phase with the self-ﬁeld of the coil, we can expect a higher
magnetic ﬁeld magnitude in the inner part (where the external
and self ﬁeld are in the same direction) and lower in the
outer part of the coil (where the external and self ﬁeld are
in opposite direction). Moreover, the external magnetic ﬁeld
will be perpendicular to the tape in the straight section and
parallel in the curved one. This will create a more complex
behavior than in the transport current operating condition.

Figure 13 shows the current density behavior when the
transport current is equal to zero, and after the ﬁrst half period
of the sinusoidal cycle. As it can be observed, the straight
section is fully penetrated with critical current density. We can
notice one front of current coming from the inner side of the
homogenized stack, and a very thin current front in the outer
part of the middle of the straight section (where the external
and self ﬁeld are in opposite directions). The curved section
shows a transit behavior in space from a fully penetrated zone
(straight part) to a partially penetrated one. In the middle,
we can notice two fronts of current penetrating the stack at
the top and bottom. The inner part is fully penetrated, but
the outer part has gray areas that show a partial penetration
of the current in the coil. In comparison with the transport

current operating condition (ﬁgure 10), this behavior indicates
that the external magnetic ﬁeld has a stronger inﬂuence in the
straight section of the coil than in the curved one, due to the
torsion of the stack in the geometry of the coil from the straight
part (where the external magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the
tape) into the curved part (where the external magnetic ﬁeld
is parallel to the tape).

The total AC losses in the coil for this operating condition
are 3.62 J per cycle, which represents more than three times
the AC losses of the transport current case with the same
current amplitude (0.95 J per cycle). The complex current
density behavior and the big increase in the AC losses ob-
served in this sub-section suggest that a 3D approach is better
suited for the analysis of this operating condition. This 3D
approach provides a more accurate estimation of losses and
allows an electromagnetic analysis that can not be done with
a 2D approximation.

VI. D-SHAPE COIL MODEL AND ANALYSIS

In this section,

the geometry of a D-shaped coil, used
in Tokamak fusion devices, is investigated [38], [39]. The
shape and dimensions of the coil are shown in ﬁgure 14
(design parameters presented in [40]). The geometrical design
of this type of coil features a straight inner leg and curved
segments with different radii. This geometry is reduced to a
quarter model by considering symmetry with the horizontal
and vertical planes at the center of the coil.

Due to the high ratio of the coil dimension to the HTS
conductor cross-section, the model has a large number of de-
grees of freedom. To keep the simulation within a manageable
timeframe, the meshing of the geometry needs to be carefully
chosen. It is important to use as few elements as possible
while not compromising the accuracy of the model. This limits
the number of elements that can be used to mesh the HTS
conductor cross-section. By using a structured, quadrilateral
mesh in the superconducting domain (10 elements equally
spaced along the tape width and 8 elements along the width
of the stack) and a free tetrahedral mesh in the surrounding

from [40]. The HTS conductor cross-section is used for the case study. All
the dimensions are in millimetres.

air domain, the whole geometry can be meshed with 22822
elements in total, resulting in 293477 degrees of freedom.

In the ﬁrst step, the modeling approach with the D-shaped
geometry is validated by using the same HTS cross-section
the
presented in the previous section. For the validation,
transport losses of the 3D model are compared to a 2D axial
symmetric model. The mean radius is calculated from the
height and width of the 3D geometry (Rm = 145 mm) to
approximate the D-shaped coil in 2D. The results for the
comparison of transport currents ranging from 30 A to 120 A
are shown in ﬁgure 16. It can be seen that the agreement
between the models is very good, with a maximum relative
difference of 12.9 %.

Subsequently, a study case for a load cycle is evaluated by

the inside of the coil. The current penetration is shown at t = 2.5 s (during the relaxation time after the ramp-up phase) at a constant current of 50 A, and
at t = 5.5 s (during the relaxation time after the ramp-down phase) at a constant current of 0 A.

using the HTS cross-section shown in ﬁgure 14. The critical
current for this coil is 60 A. In the ﬁrst second of the load
cycle, the transport current is ramped up from 0 A to 50 A,
followed by a 2 s relaxation time. Then the current is ramped
down over 1 s from 50 A to 0 A, and at the end another 2 s
are given as relaxation time. This load cycle is shown in
ﬁgure 17 by the red dashed line. The blue and green dashed
lines correspond to the power dissipation calculated with the
2D, and 3D models respectively.

There are two distinct peaks in the losses, which occur at the

end of each ramp phase (up/down). During the ramp-up of the
current, the losses of the 3D model show a ripple effect, which
can be attributed to the mesh distribution of the conductor area.
This behavior is ampliﬁed at lower currents, if we keep the
same mesh, and it can also be observed in coarsely meshed
2D models.

The instantaneous losses at the end of the ramp-up phase
at 1 s are 1.69 W for the 2D model and 1.61 W for the 3D
model. For the second peak at the end of the ramp-down phase
at 4 s, the instantaneous losses are 0.26 W and 0.39 W, for

2D and 3D respectively. The evaluation of the losses for the
whole load cycle shows that there is a discrepancy, and the
2D model underestimates the losses for this complex geometry
by 11.54 %. The losses amount to 0.69 J and 0.78 J for the
whole load cycle, for the 2D and 3D models respectively. In
ﬁgure 15, the current penetration is shown at 2.5 s (during
the stabilization after the initial ramp phase) and at 5.5 s
(after the ramp down). On the left side of the ﬁgure, the
locations of the cut planes are indicated in the geometry. The
current distribution is shown in the respective cut planes of
the 3D model and compared to the solution from the 2D axial
symmetric model. In the cut planes CP in and CP out, the
distribution is almost identical to the 2D model. The largest
difference can be observed in the cut plane of the segment
with the smallest radius (CP R1). The current penetration at
the inside of the coil is higher than at the outside of the coil.
This can be explained by the inﬂuence of the self-ﬁeld, which
is larger in the inner part of the segment with the highest
curvature. The 2D and 3D models show a good agreement.
The computation time for a 1 s ramp phase is about 20 h for
the 3D model, while the 2D model ﬁnishes within minutes. For
a detailed investigation of a D-shaped coil, the 3D model can
provide a better understanding of the electromagnetic behavior.

VII. TWISTED COIL MODEL AND ANALYSIS

We study in this section a more complex geometry that has
no straight parts. The twisted coil has only curved sections
with a continuous twist along the length of the coil. The model
and development of coils with this kind of geometry can be
beneﬁcial for the fusion sector [41], [42]. However, the case
under analysis is not part of any speciﬁc application. As men-
tioned in section V, the detailed geometry and electromagnetic
environment are necessary for any analysis of superconducting
devices and applications, since they can strongly inﬂuence the
losses and electromagnetic behavior of the coils. Therefore,
this case of study can be seen as a complete curved and
twisted coil analysis that shows the potential application of
the modeling approach in a coil similar to the one used in the
fusion sector.

The geometry and dimensions of the coil are presented in
ﬁgure 18. As it can be noticed, it has one plane of symmetry.
Therefore, only one-half of the coil was modeled. The critical
current of this coil is 60 A.

We considered a DC transport current as the operating
condition of the coil. For this reason, we simulate the current
ramp-up/down process as one possible test or operating cycle.
As it was done in the previous case study, we ﬁrst ramp-up
the current from 0 A to 50 A (83.33 % of the critical current)
in one second and wait 2 s as relaxation time. Then, we ramp-
down the current from 50 A to 0 A in one second and wait 2 s
as relaxation time. The overall load cycle and losses behavior
can be observed in ﬁgure 19. We have two peaks in the losses
of the coil related to the ramp-up/down periods of the current.
These losses were estimated by using the aforementioned 3D
approach and a simpliﬁed 2D T-A homogenized model of the
cross-section of the coil. The 3D model estimates a peak in
the instantaneous losses due to the ﬁrst ramp of 1.61 W and

Fig. 18. Geometry and dimensions of the twisted coil under study. The coil
is made with 100 turns of HTS tape, which creates a stack 4 mm wide and
4.65 mm height in the cross-section of the coil. All the dimensions are in
millimeters.

models.

the 2D model estimates a peak of 1.40 W. This difference
can be related to the fact that the 2D model can not consider
the continuous twist and curves along the length of the coil.
Similarly, the 3D model also estimates a slightly higher value
for the second peak in the instantaneous losses due to the
second ramp (0.24 W), in comparison with the 2D model
(0.16 W).

Figure 20 shows the behavior of the current density in half
of the coil at t=5.5 s (during the relaxation time after the ramp-
down). In this ﬁgure, the red line highlights the position of
the same side of the coil cross-section along the twist. The
current penetration is sometimes higher on one side of the
homogenized stack, sometimes higher on the other side, and in
some cases looks symmetrical. This behavior is related to the
interaction of the current density with the self-ﬁeld produced
by different parts of the curved and twisted geometry, which

the same instant in time.

can cause local higher penetration and saturation of current.
This behavior can not be reproduced by a 2D model. Figure 20
also shows the current penetration in the 2D T-A homogenized
model for the same time reference. As it can be observed,
the current penetration is more symmetrical in the 2D model.
This can cause the discrepancies in the estimation of losses
presented before. These discrepancies can be higher depending
on the geometry, local effects, and operating conditions.

In this case of study, the 2D T-A homogenized model can
provide a ﬁrst estimation of the losses due to the current ramp-
up/down process (without external magnetic ﬁeld). However,
a 3D model can provide a better electromagnetic analysis of
local effects (current saturation and high penetration zones)
that can cause higher losses at different operating conditions
or electromagnetic environments.

VIII. CONCLUSION
The 3D T-A homogenization modeling technique was used
to study the behavior of superconducting coils with complex
3D geometries under different operating conditions. The pro-
posed normal vector approach based on a curvilinear coor-
dinate system deﬁnition allowed an easier implementation (in
comparison with the currently available 3D H homogenization)
despite the complexity of the geometry. Therefore, it represents
a practical tool for the analysis of HTS devices with complex
shapes.

We validated ﬁrst the modeling approach with the racetrack
coil studied in [25] by comparing the results with the 3D H
homogenization technique. Then, we modeled and analyzed
a saddle coil, which represented a case study with potential
applications in the magnet and superconducting electrical ma-
chine sectors. The operating conditions under study were AC
transport current and AC transport current with AC externally
applied magnetic ﬁeld. We compared the results with a 2D
T-A homogenized model, which gave a good approximation
of the losses for the ﬁrst operating condition, but can not be
used for the electromagnetic analysis of the second one.

A D-Shape coil and a twisted coil (without straight parts)
were also modeled and analyzed. These cases have potential
applications in the fusion energy sector. The operating condi-
tion considered for these coils was DC transport current. For
this reason, the ramp-up/down process was simulated.

For the coils simulated in this publication, the losses due
to AC or the ramp-up/down process can be estimated with
a 2D model. This approach provides a good approximation
and offers a great reduction of degrees of freedom due to
the reduction of dimension. Therefore, it represents a good
compromise between accuracy and computation time. How-
ever, the behaviour of the coils due to transport current and
external magnetic ﬁeld can be more complex. For this oper-
ating condition, the 3D model can provide a better estimation
of losses and detect zones with local saturation of current,
as was seen in the saddle coil simulations. The operating
conditions of HTS coils in the majority of applications (such as
electrical machines and fusion experiments) involve transport
current and magnetic ﬁeld. In these cases, the study of the
interaction with other coils, magnets, and materials in intricate
3D geometries is only feasible with a 3D model.

These analyzes show the versatility of the modeling ap-
proach and its efﬁciency for AC loss estimation in coils.
Moreover, the studies support and encourage the modeling and
development of HTS coils with complex geometries, necessary
to overcome the technological challenges of superconducting
devices in multiple ﬁelds and applications.
