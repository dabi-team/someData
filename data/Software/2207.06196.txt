ABSTRACT

Machine learning has proved useful in many software disciplines, including computer vision, speech
and audio processing, natural language processing, robotics and some other ﬁelds. However, its
applicability has been signiﬁcantly hampered due its black-box nature and signiﬁcant resource
consumption. Performance is achieved at the expense of enormous computational resource and
usually compromising the robustness and trustworthiness of the model. Recent researches have
been identifying a lack of interactivity as the prime source of these machine learning problems.
Consequently, interactive machine learning (iML) has acquired increased attention of researchers on
account of its human-in-the-loop modality and relatively efﬁcient resource utilization. Thereby, a state-
of-the-art review of interactive machine learning plays a vital role in easing the effort toward building
human-centred models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art of
iML. We analyze salient research works using merit-oriented and application/task oriented mixed
taxonomy. We use a bottom-up clustering approach to generate a taxonomy of iML research works.
Research works on adversarial black-box attacks and corresponding iML based defense system,
exploratory machine learning, resource constrained learning, and iML performance evaluation are
analyzed under their corresponding theme in our merit-oriented taxonomy. We have further classiﬁed
these research works into technical and sectoral categories. Finally, research opportunities that we
believe are inspiring for future work in iML are discussed thoroughly.

Introduction

Interactive machine learning (iML) is an active machine learning technique in which models are designed and
implemented with human-in-the-loop manner. End-users participate in model building process by iteratively feeding
training parameters, inspecting model outputs and providing feedback on intermediate results Arendt et al. [2017],
Amershi et al. [2014], Fails and Olsen Jr [2003], Jiang et al. [2019], Holzinger et al. [2018], Boukhelifa et al. [2018],
Liu et al. [2017a], Françoise [2020].

The conception of iML dates back to the emergence of query learning where queries are used to learn unknown
concepts Ghai et al. [2021], Angluin [1988], Holzinger [2016], Chung et al. [2020], Fogarty et al. [2008]. A model
building component in iML framework interacts with Oracles by issuing queries for additional training data or feedback
against its intermediate results. iML based methods mainly aspires to build robust Huang et al. [2011], Papernot et al.

iML is becoming the center of machine learning research Jiang et al. [2019], Arendt et al. [2017] as the need to operate
in resource constrained environments and engaging the human-in-the-loop increased over time. Various iML systems
have been designed and implemented to alleviate the long-standing setbacks of standard machine learning algorithms.
Its impact has been studied in health Holzinger et al. [2018], Wallace et al. [2012], Holzinger [2016], Maadi et al.

Liu et al. [2017b], Ma et al. [2019], Mühlbacher et al. [2014]. Most research focus ranges from extending standard
machine learning models with interactive capabilities to formulating robust performance evaluation mechanisms.

Sate-of-the-art review gives insights on recent progresses on a speciﬁc subject matter and paves ways for more research.
To this end, numerous surveys have been conducted on the application of iML to speciﬁc sectors. Architectural Dudley
and Kristensson [2018], Chatzimparmpas et al. [2020], Meza Martínez et al. [2019] and application/sector oriented
Jiang et al. [2019], Liakos et al. [2018], Maadi et al. [2021] analysis has been signiﬁcantly used techniques in the past.
According to the meta-analysis Meza Martínez et al. [2019], Dudley and Kristensson [2018], Maadi et al. [2021], Liakos
et al. [2018], Chatzimparmpas et al. [2020], Jiang et al. [2019], Amershi et al. [2014], Liu et al. [2017a], Teso and Hinz
[2020] we conducted, most surveys lack extensiveness and inclusiveness, leaving the various researches that constitute
the state-of-the-art of iML untouched. In Amershi et al. [2014], Dudley and Kristensson [2018] and Meza Martínez
et al. [2019], the advancements made towards designing usable interfaces for iML is discussed. A review of iML and
interactive visualization has been conducted in Liu et al. [2017a] and Meza Martínez et al. [2019]. Moreover, a review
of iML inspired researches in medical and agricultural sectors is extensively studied in Maadi et al. [2021] and Liakos
et al. [2018] respectively. A recent task-oriented extensive survey on interactive machine learning is also presented in
Jiang et al. [2019].

However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been a little extensive survey in the ﬁeld of iML covering the
state-of-the-art. Besides, no survey offer a merit-oriented and detailed state-of-the-art review. Therefore, the primary
motivation of this paper is to summarize recent advancements in interactive machine learning by using merit-oriented
taxonomy. We follow a similar approach like prior surveys but broadening our scope using merit-oriented taxonomy of
iML.

In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art of interactive machine learning and thoroughly present research works
in a merit-oriented taxonomy. While our main focus is on discussing iML contributions for robust, trustworthy and
low resource machine learning, we have also presented issues related to iML performance evaluation. In section 2,
we discuss about the overall merit-oriented architecture of iML. In section 3, adversarial attacks against black-box
machine learning models are discussed. Moreover, it presents various iML inspired contributions aiming to combat
adversarial attacks. We present researches conducted to increase the explainability and interpretability as a way to
achieve trustworthy machine learning in section 4. Researches that employ human-in-the-loop for data processing
and model building with the intention of lowering the data and computational resources are discussed in section 5. In
section 6, we discuss the subjective nature of iML and related efforts to address problems in evaluating it. Further

analysis of ﬁndings and discussion is presented in 7. In the last section, a summary of the state-of-the-art review and
potential research opportunities that are inspiring for future work on iML are discussed.

2 Merit-Oriented Taxonomy of iML

iML inspired contributions can be analysed from various perspectives. However, architectural Dudley and Kristensson
[2018], Chatzimparmpas et al. [2020], Meza Martínez et al. [2019] and application/sector oriented Jiang et al. [2019],
Liakos et al. [2018], Maadi et al. [2021] analysis has been signiﬁcantly used techniques in the past. However, according
to the meta-analysis Meza Martínez et al. [2019], Dudley and Kristensson [2018], Maadi et al. [2021], Liakos et al.
[2018], Chatzimparmpas et al. [2020], Jiang et al. [2019], Amershi et al. [2014], Liu et al. [2017a], Teso and Hinz
[2020] we conducted, most survey papers lack extensiveness and inclusiveness, leaving the various researches that
constitute the state-of-the-art of iML untouched. Consequently, the employment of iML has been constrained to only
predeﬁned sectors or limited scope of the architecture.

To this end, we have thoroughly analysed the recent iML-inspired research works using merit-oriented taxonomy. After
an extensive review of iML-inspired literature and untapped problems, we have categorized contributions into Robust

techniques that face bias because of the subjective nature of iML are analysed Boukhelifa et al. [2018], Krause et al.

representation of merit-oriented architecture of iML is depicted in Figure 1. Our state-of-the-art review is channeled
under these major merits of iML.

3 Robust Machine Learning

Deep learning algorithms are known for their vulnerability to adversarial attacks Szegedy et al. [2013b]. Adversaries
can craftily manipulate legitimate inputs, which may be imperceptible to human eye, but can force a trained model to
produce incorrect outputs. This issue is directly related to the black-box and intricacy nature of deep learning Papernot
et al. [2017], Carlini and Wagner [2017], Szegedy et al. [2013a], Sun et al. [2018], Tu et al. [2019], Tramèr et al. [2017],
Huang et al. [2011].

We use Papernot et al. [2016a] and Chakraborty et al. [2018] threat model to highlight the state-of-the-art of the
adversarial attack. According to Papernot et al. [2016a], adversarial threat model is comprised of the following three
dimensions, namely: the attack surface, adversarial capabilities, and adversarial goals. The attack surface refers to
the overall data processing pipeline of machine learning from input to output and then action. Evasion attack Biggio
et al. [2013], Kwon et al. [2018a,b], poisoning attack Chen et al. [2017], Zhang et al. [2019], Geiping et al. [2021] and
exploratory attacks Papernot et al. [2017], Brendel et al. [2017], Guo et al. [2019] are the main scenarios considered
under the attack surface. The aforementioned attacks can further be dissected into training phase Chen et al. [2017],
Zhang et al. [2019], Geiping et al. [2021] and testing phase Biggio et al. [2013], Kwon et al. [2018a,b] attacks from the
adversarial capabilities point of view. Data injection, data modiﬁcation and logic corruption are among the strategies of
training phase adversarial capability attacks. On the other hand, white-box Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. [2016], Tramèr
et al. [2016] and black-box Papernot et al. [2016b], Rosenberg et al. [2017] attacks are among the testing phase
capability attacks. Adversarial goal attack, on the other hand, infer adversary from the incorrectness of the target
model. It is also further classiﬁed as conﬁdence reduction, misclassiﬁcation, targeted misclassiﬁcation and source/target
misclassiﬁcation.

Adversarial attacks have real impacts on the robustness of a deep learning and other standard machine learning methods
Wang [2021]. Therefore, exploring potential adversarial attacks and building a robust machine learning has been the
focus of machine learning researchers.

There are various techniques being studied to address the problem of adversarial attacks. Researchers in the iML domain
derived a number of strategies both to showcase the impact of adversaries Morris et al. [2020] and tackle Slack et al.
[2020], Das et al. [2018] adversarial attack strategies discussed in Papernot et al. [2016a]. The fundamental assumption
is that assuring the explainability and interpretability of black-box models by having the human-in-the-loop reduce the
vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attack Rudin [2019].

iML has been used as a way to explain and explore model vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks as in Ma et al. [2019]
and Das et al. [2020]. Speciﬁcally, Ma et al. [2019] enables exploration and explanation of model vulnerabilities to
test-phase or poisoning adversarial attacks from the perspective of models, data instances, features, and local structures.
A white-box exploratory attack based approach, Das et al. [2020], interactively visualizes neurons and their connections
inside a DNN that are strongly activated or suppressed by an adversarial attack. Massif provides both a high-level,
interpretable overview of the effect of an attack on a DNN, and a low-level, detailed description of the affected neurons.

In addition to explaining potentially perturbated inputs and models, iML based methods such as Slack et al. [2020]
propose frameworks that masks the discriminatory biases of black-box classiﬁers. This plays a vital role to compensate
the effects of perturbated inputs on a given model.

In addition to letting the user detect potential adversarial attacks and managing its impacts, iML has also been used to
directly engage users in the model building process. This helps to avoid both training phase and test phase adversarial
attacks as the user will be there validating inputs and intermediate results. A graph based framework, Emamjomeh-
Zadeh and Kempe [2017], where user feedback is represented as edges and nodes are the models is a good example
of such applications. It proposes Angluin’s equivalence query model Angluin [1988, 1992] and Littlestone’s online
learning model Littlestone [1988] based on a robust machine learning framework that interactively learns models like
classiﬁers Angluin [1988, 1992], orderings/rankings of items Joachims [2002], Radlinski and Joachims [2005], or
clusterings of data points Awasthi et al. [2014], Emamjomeh-Zadeh and Kempe [2018], Balcan and Blum [2008]. In
each iteration, the algorithm proposes a model, and the user either accepts it or reveals a speciﬁc mistake in the proposal.
The feedback is correct only with probability p > 1/2 (and adversarially incorrect with probability 1 −p), i.e., the
algorithm must be able to learn in the presence of arbitrary noise.

Interactive machine learning has also been applied to tackle adversarial attacks on automatic speech recognition (ASR)
models. For instance, Morris et al. [2020] designed a tool allowing experimentation with adversarial attacks and
defenses on ASR. It implemented iML techniques and psychoacoustic principles to effectively eliminate targeted
attacks. A similar and cloud-based tool to evaluate and compare state-of-the-art adversarial attacks and defenses for
machine learning (ML) models is proposed in Das et al. [2019].

4 Trustworthy Machine Learning

To design and develop AI-based systems that users and the larger public can justiﬁably trust, one needs to understand
how machine learning technologies impact trust Toreini et al. [2020]. The trustworthiness of AI-based systems is
directly related to how the user is conﬁdent about the decisions made by the machine learning components. This may
include its perception about both the intelligent model and knowledge Yin et al. [2019].

Users understanding of a given domain may negatively affect the trustworthiness of a model built around that speciﬁc
domain. As it clearly stated in Honeycutt et al. [2020], the act of providing feedback can affect user understanding of an
intelligent system and its accuracy. User trust toward a given model and even the perception of model accuracy might
lower; regardless of whether the system accuracy is improved in response to their feedback. However, trustworthiness
of a model should be deﬁned considering its relative ability, benevolence and integrity.

To this end, we use the Trust Antecedent (TA) framework Mayer et al. [1995] deﬁnition of trust. According to this
framework a trustee is given trust if it is perceived to have the ability, benevolence, and integrity toachive the desired
goal. However, a black-box machine learning model that doesn’t show its implementation details can not comply with
the principles of this framework, hence affecting its trustworthiness. Besides, the black-box nature of these models
signiﬁcantly affects their applicability in in decision sensitive areas like health, ﬁnance, autonomous vehicles, criminal
justice, etc.

Consequently, enhancing the trustworthiness of machine learning algorithms comes with making the model building
process interactive Gutzwiller and Reeder [2017], Krause et al. [2016], Maadi et al. [2021]. Put succinctly, increasing
the explainability and interpretability of machine learning by engaging user-in-the-loop increase its trustworthiness.

To this end, various explanatory frameworks that shows the implementation details of the model building process have
been introduced. The essence of most exploratory algorithms is that intermediate results corresponding to a batch or
even tuple are made subject to user-feedback whenever there is a variation between the predicted and the actual label.

In important contributions like Teso and Kersting [2019], Van Den Elzen and Van Wijk [2011], Mozina [2018], the iML
is set to interactively query labels whenever the intermediate model fails to predict the label for each data point. For
every prediction, the model provides the predicted label and explanations for the prediction. However, the way the the
model and feedback are could be visual or textual.

Visual explainer systems are designed considering a set of guidelines proposed in various research contributions. For
instance, Mühlbacher et al. [2014] propose a set of guidelines for integrating visualization into machine learning
algorithms through a formalized description and comparison. Speciﬁc to automated iterative algorithms, which are
widely used in model optimization, these researchers recommend exposing APIs for visualization developers. Using
high-resolution APIs, visualization developers access the internal iterations for a tighter integration of the user in the
decision loop.

Accordingly, Teso and Kersting [2019] propose a framework called CAIPI is proposed. It use a model-agnostic
explainer, LIME Ribeiro et al. [2016], as fundamental component to compute the explainer and present them to the user
as interpretable (visual) artifacts. Similarly, Van Den Elzen and Van Wijk [2011] propose a natural visual representation
of decision tree structures where decision criterion is visualized in the tree nodes. BOOSTVis Liu et al. [2017b] and
iForest Zhao et al. [2018] also focus on explaining tree ensemble models through the use of multiple coordinated views
to help explain and explore decision paths.

Models and feedback from users can also be represented using textual-explanatory systems. An argument based
explanatory iML algorithm Mozina [2018] propose a framework that exploits the usability of arguments to precisely
axiomatize feedbacks both from the user and system side. It practically shows how to narrow the gap between domain
experts and the machine learning model by engaging domain experts. Users provide feedbacks using a pair of reasons
and outputs called arguments. Since arguments are generally presumptive and can’t be untaken for a general set of
predictions, the authors introduced prediction-level argument based explanations of decisions made by the learning
model. Put succinctly, the training module generates initial features to perform prediction or classiﬁcation. Whenever
the learner notice major deviation between the desired and actual prediction, it consults the domain expert to provide
feedback on the output (both the prediction and explanation). At this stage, the domain expert would be able to see
the problem either in the predicted label or the rule yielding the outcome. Then, the user provides a set of arguments
for each critical example (predictions with problem) and let the model to retrain keeping the feedback given from the
user. Moreover, the paper dictated how the user should communicate with the machine learning component through
a sequence of steps namely: Selection, Presentation, Argument formulation, Counter example detection, reﬁnement,
argument pruning. Another goal goal-oriented safe exploration algorithm that provably avoids unsafe decisions in real
world problems is proposed in Turchetta et al. [2019].This framework takes suggested decisions as input and exploits
regularity assumptions in terms of a Gaussian process prior in order to efﬁciently learn about their safety.

A PREPRINT

Exploratory machine learning has been applied to various decision sensitive sectors such as autonomous vehicles, health,
and military. In Gutzwiller and Reeder [2017] used exploratory components to build trust among autonomous robots.
Speciﬁcally, they analyzed the importance of using iML with neuro-evolutionary algorithms and conducted two separate
tests were conducted on two autonomous environments; one with iML empowered ML algorithm and the other with
black-box ML algorithms. The major problem they selected for this experiment is Search. Participants in this research
engaged in building iML based search plan models. Finally, they were allowed to see and distinguish between the plans
as iML generated or black-box generated. To this end, participants were able to choose iML based search plans for its
effectiveness but with less trust relative to the black-box algorithm. The authors justiﬁed the preliminary knowledge of
participants as the reason for their low degree of trust on the iML algorithm. In conclusion, the researchers convey the
importance of using iML based neuro-evolutionary algorithms for searching problems of autonomous robots.

The application of iML in the health sector has also alleviated major computational trust related problems Holzinger
et al. [2018], Berg et al. [2019]. A biological image data analysis tool called ilastik Berg et al. [2019] propose an iML
framework that address the speed and usability requirements of machine learning by reasonably compromising model
accuracy. Ilastik is able to formulate a feature space without the need to use bulk data as the other classical machine
learning algorithms.

5 Low Resource Machine Learning

Low resource machine learning is a process of building an analytical model employing optimal resource utilization
techniques. However, most machine learning algorithms have tradeoff between accuracy and resource utilization. As it
is stated in Preuveneers et al. [2020], the most accurate model might be prohibitively expensive to computationally
evaluate on a resource constrained environment. Consequently, the problem of building accurate and high performance
machine learning models has been achieved at the expense of resource (data and computing) utilization. Nonetheless,
sufﬁcient amount of data and computing resources are not always at the stake. Besides, some problems may also require
to be run on low resource setting. For instance, the use of pervasive devices and robots to build model is one valid
scenario.

To this end, interactive machine learning help scientists and engineers exploit more specialized data within their
deployed environment in less time, with greater accuracy and fewer costs Porter et al. [2013]. Various iML inspired
researches has been conducted in the past couple of years. In this section, we will be discussing iML inspired solutions
that aim at enabling low resource machine learning and improving the speed of models.

We have categorized our analysis of iML for low resource learning into small data machine learning and pervasive
machine learning. In the small data machine learning section, we discuss contributions that use small data to build
models in a low resource environment. On the other hand, the application of iML in pervasive low resource environment
is discussed in the pervasive machine learning section.

5.1 Small Data Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms usually requires a large volume of data in order to yield accurate result Holzinger et al.
[2017]. However, big data is not always at stake to be used in some problem domains like under-developed languages,
clinical trials, biomedical science and etc. Achieving small data machine learning requires optimal utilization of data.
Engaging domain experts in the model building process in an interactive way would result in optimal utilization of
important data items in a way contributing to the development of accurate models with small data.

To this end, interactive machine learning has a critical role. Hence, it has been studied by various researchers in the area
of machine translation Ortiz-Martínez et al. [2010], Ambati [2011], González-Rubio et al. [2012], Peris et al. [2017],
Lam et al. [2018], Foster et al. [1997], Huang et al. [2021], computer vision, search engine, social network analysis,
music and games, and in data constrained sectors like health.

As it is mentioned above,iML based algorithms deﬁnes the state-of-the-art of machine translation systems. In such kind
of systems, the knowledge of a human translator is combined with a MT system. For instance, Ambati [2011] propose
a resource constrained machine translation. This paper explored active learning as an efﬁcient way to reduce costs
and make best use of human resource for building low-resource machine translation systems. Speciﬁcally, the author
extended the traditional active learning approach of single annotation optimization to handle cases of multiple-type
annotations. Furthermore, it show further reduction of costs in building low-resource machine translation systems.
Reduction of the required annotated data inherently enabled low resource machine learning. Similarly, various classical
IMT researches has been conducted in the few consecutive years. For instance, Ortiz-Martínez et al. [2010] propose an
interactive online machine translation system that avoids the use of batch learning. In González-Rubio et al. [2012], an
AL framework for interactive machine translation specially designed to process data streams with massive volumes

A PREPRINT

of data is presented. Recently, a couple of researches have also began to incorporate contemporary machine learning
techniques for iMT. In Peris et al. [2017] and Lam et al. [2018], an interactive translation system, based on neural
machine translation is deployed. Besides, a full-ﬂedged iMT tools like Huang et al. [2021] has been proposed to further
boost accuracy of machine translation systems.

Interactive machine learning also plays a signiﬁcant role in image processing and computer vision in general.The use of
iML for automatic feature selection is proposed in Fails and Olsen Jr [2003]. In this work, the researchers exploit the
capacity of iML for automated feature selection. It show how to use iML to eliminate a manual feature selection. The
training component of their architecture incorporates the feature selection sub component which further cooperates with
the classiﬁer, user feedback manager, and the user as a manual feedback provider. Furthermore, this research introduced
an iML image processing framework called Crayons. Crayons is a toolto review and correct classiﬁer errors by using
customized decision tree as a learning algorithm and Mean Split Sub Sampled (MSSS) sampling technique.

Search engine optimization is also among the areas that has been studied by iML researchers. In a research contribution
by

Besides, Fogarty et al. [2008], an interactive KNN based desktop application that enable re-rankings on a keyword-based
web image search engine relying on the visual characteristics of images is proposed.

Another important iML enabled low resource learning is employed for pattern mining research problem. As it is known,
pattern mining is an important process in exploratory data analysis. Various tools have been built to mine patterns from
large datasets. However, the problem of identifying patterns that are genuinely interesting to a particular user remains
challenging as it requires machine learning experts in addition to the domain expert Dzyuba et al. [2014]. To this end,
iML plays a vital role both in enabling low resource pattern mining and assuring its valuability for speciﬁc users. For
instance, Amershi et al. [2012] formulated a tool called ReGroup that provides users with ﬁlters that were generated
based on features in the model. Put succinctly, ReGroup leverages the iML paradigm to assist users in creating custom
contact groups in online social networks. The classiﬁer provides a potential pattern of users (ﬁlters) in social network
that likely qualiﬁes for membership in a custom group that is being created. The users are set to provide feedback on
each recommended ﬁlters where a selection of a contact for inclusion is taken as a positive sample and the remaining
are skipped as negative samples. Likewise, the user reﬁnes the behaviour of the model with incremental improvements
derived through iteratively applied user inputs. Participants noted that these ﬁlters provided insight in the patterns that
were being exploited by the model, and thus served the dual purpose of explaining the model as well as their intended
function as an interaction element. Besides, another research Dzyuba et al. [2014] use iML to formulate a pattern
mining framework to mine user speciﬁc patterns. In this framework, the user is asked to rank small sets of patterns
while a ranking function is inferred from this feedback by preference learning techniques. With a user supplemented by
active learning heuristics, the resulting accurate rankings of patterns are used to mine new and more interesting patterns.
They demonstrated their framework in frequent item-set and subgroup discovery pattern mining tasks. The ability of
the framework to learn patterns accurately and the importance of its heuristic approach to ease users effort is presented
precisely.

iML has also been applied to various game and entertainment research problems. A sketch-rnn, Ha and Eck [2017],
present an interactive recurrent neural network (RNN) that help to construct stroke-based drawings of common objects.
Besides their model encode existing sketches into a latent vector, and generate similar looking sketches conditioned on
the latent space. Similarly, a research work in Jain et al. [2020] emphasize the design of a deep reinforcement learning
agent that can play from feedback alone. This algorithm takes advantage of the structural characteristics of text-based
games. Moreover, the application of iML in motion-driven music systems is presented in Fiebrink and Cook [2010],
Gillian and Paradiso [2014], Schedel et al. [2011].Due to the complications to design a robust player-recognition or
motion recognition system using standalone iML system, an enhanced model has been presented in Diaz et al. [2019].
They proposed an iML solution for Unity3D game engine in the form of a visual node system supporting classiﬁcation
(with k-nearest neighbour), regression (with multilayer perceptron neural networks) and time series analysis (with
dynamic time warping) of sensor data.

The health sector is also known for data scarcity. In this sector, researchers are often confronted with only a small number
of dataset or rare events, where a machine learning algorithm suffers from insufﬁcient training samples Holzinger
[2016], Maadi et al. [2021]. To this end iML researches has been conducted to build resource constrained model that
adheres to the trustworthiness principles. In Holzinger et al. [2018], an interactive Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
technique is applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is an intransigent mathematical problem to
ﬁnd the shortest path through a set of points and returning to the origin. It is among the problems that resembles most
computational problems in the health informatics sector. They introduce two novel concepts: Human-Interaction-Matrix
(HIM) and Human-Impact-Factor (HIF) to control the ants action and the variable interpretation of the HIM respectively.
The authors implemented their framework using a java-script based browser solution which has a great beneﬁt of

iML: A State of the Art Review

A PREPRINT

platform independence and conﬁguration. Although the results they found are promising, the researchers suggested
further works like such as gamiﬁcation and crowdsourcing to solve hard computational problems.

As we have discussed in the ﬁrst section of this document, the essence of iML is to leverage the beneﬁts of the human-
in-the-loop. However, the presence of the human does not by itself guarantee the trustworthiness and performance of
the model. The interaction between the user and the learning model should be supplemented with clear and in-depth
visualization methods. To this end, Amershi et al. [2011] emphasize on how to design effective end-user interaction
with interactive machine learning systems. They shape the human-model interaction in a way it answers these critical
questions: which examples should a person provide to efﬁciently train the system, how should the system illustrate its
current understanding and how can a person evaluate the quality of the system’s current understanding in order to better
guide it towards the desired behavior. Another practical contribution for human-model interaction is provided by Li
et al. [2018]. They propose a new visual analytic approach to iML and visual data mining. Multi-dimensional data
visualization techniques are employed to facilitate user interactions with the machine learning and mining process. This
allows dynamic user feedback forms (data selection, data labeling and correction) to enhance the efﬁciency of model
building. In particular, this approach can signiﬁcantly reduce the amount of data required for training accurate models.
Hence, it can be highly impactful for applications where large amount of data is hard to obtain. The proposed approach
is tested on two application problems: the handwriting recognition (classiﬁcation) problem and the human cognitive
score prediction (regression) problem. Both experiments show that visualization supported iML and data mining can
achieve the same accuracy as an automatic process can with much smaller training data sets. Furthermore, Arendt
et al. [2018] propose a scalable client-server system for real-time iML framework called Computer-Human Interaction
for Semi-Supervised Learning (CHISSL) Arendt et al. [2017]. The proposed system is capable of incorporating user
feedback incrementally and immediately without a predeﬁned prediction task. The light-weight computation web-client
and heavyweight server constitute their architecture. The server relies on representation learning and off-the-shelf
agglomerative clustering to ﬁnd a dendrogram, which we use to quickly approximate distances in the representation
space. The client, using only this dendrogram, incorporates user feedback via transduction. This work achieves low
resource learning as it updates distances and predictions for each unlabeled instance incrementally and deterministically,
with O(n) space and time complexity. Ultimately, this paper solved the scalability issue of CHISSL. Another important
contribution in this regard is that of Talbot et al. [2009]. In this paper, EnsembleMatrix, SVM based visualization
system, to tune classiﬁer through user in the human-in-the-loop approach to build a superior model. This product
presents a graphical view of confusion matrices to help users to directly interact with the visualization in order to
explore and build combination models.

5.2 Pervasive Machine Learning

Interactive machine learning can also yield a better performance in pervasive computing environment where there are
low computing resources. For instance, Frazier and Riedl [2019] present techniques to enable low resource computation
for deep reinforcement learning agents complex behaviors in 3D virtual environments. Speciﬁcally, they considered
an environment with high degree of aliasing, MineCraft, and conducted experiments with two reinforcement learning
algorithms which enable human teachers to give advice-Feedback Arbitration, and Newtonian Action Advice under
visual aliasing conditions. Similarly, Preuveneers et al. [2020] emphasizes on the importance of hyper tuning as a
process to select the best performing machine learning model, its architecture and parameters for a given task. The
fact that hyper parameter tuning does not take into consideration resource trade-offs when selecting the best model for
deployment in smart environments has been taken as their research challenge. Consequently, the authors proposed a
multi-objective optimization solution to ﬁnd acceptable trade-offs between model accuracy and resource consumption
to enable the deployment of machine learning models in resource constrained pervasive environments. On the other
hand, Malloch et al. [2017] used pathward and ﬁeldward techniques to enable creation of gestures that can be used by a
touch-enabled pervasive mobile devices reliably. They introduced a novel dynamic guide that visualizes the negative
space of possible gestures as the user interacts with the system.

On the other hand, Tegen et al. [2020] emphasises on the gaps of standard machine learning algorithms in dynamic
sensor setting. Consequently, an iML based framework is implemented for “activity recognition” problems. This
framework takes stream of data among different devices in the internet of things as an input. Three different machine
learning approaches were used in the experiments: Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor and Naıve Bayes
classiﬁer. These algorithms were customized to adapt the dynamic sensory setting. Uncertainty, Error (output from
the model), State Change (what change in state urges the user to change label of data), Time (the time difference b/n
queries and labeling by user), and Randomness (randomly assigning labels) are identiﬁed as factors that increase the
subjectivity of users feedback. The results of this research work make it clear that the choice of interactive learning
strategy has a signiﬁcant effect on the performance when tested on recordings of streaming data.

iML Performance Evaluation

Although there are a number of invaluable contributions towards the goal of iML algorithms, the techniques used
to evaluate their performance are not that mature. The standard machine learning algorithms use statistical model
performance evaluation techniques which provide only a sole measure, obfuscating details about critical instances,
failures and model features Ma et al. [2019]. However, the "human-in-the-loop" nature of iML systems triggers
an extended need to diagnose the subjectivity of results. Therefore, iML performance evaluation should consider
subjectively generated user evaluations and the cyclic nature of inﬂuence between the algorithm and users. This makes
the evaluation of iML systems subjective and complex Boukhelifa et al. [2018], Yang et al. [2019].

Consequently, researchers proposed both customized and noble solutions to approach these critical issues. The iML
Framework for Guided Visual Exploration (EvoGraphDice) Boukhelifa et al. [2018] is among the salient ones that is
produced after an extensive experimental review of existing evaluation techniques. This paper founded its base mainly
on the gaps of user based and system based feedback evaluation techniques to get insights on the underlying co-operation
and co-adaptation mechanisms between the algorithm and the human. EvoGraphDice couples algorithm-centered and
user-centered evaluations to bring forth insights on the underlying co-operation and co-adaptation mechanisms between
the algorithm and the Human. Other papers focus on the input and output nature of iML models to diagnose their
performance. For instance, the INFUSE system Krause et al. [2014] supports the interactive ranking of features based
on feature selection algorithms and cross-validation performances. Another work Krause et al. [2017] also propose
a performance diagnosis workﬂow. In this work, the instance-level diagnosis leverages measures of “local feature
relevance” to guide the visual inspection of root causes that trigger misclassiﬁcation.

Yang et al. [2019] identify diversiﬁed scenarios and subjective nature of explanations for the absence of benchmarks
to evaluate explanations of iML algorithms.Consequently, they have deﬁned the problem of evaluating explanations
and systematically reviewed the existing efforts from state-of-the-arts. The authors discuss explanation as global
(overall working structure) and local (particular model behaviour for individual instances) from scope perspective and
as intrinsic (self-interpretable models) and posthoc (independent interpretation model) from dimension perspective.
Furthermore, generalizability (generalization), ﬁdelity (degree of exactness) and persuasibility (comprehensibility)
are identiﬁed as the three properties of explanation and corresponding methods has been revised for each aspect. As
a result, they designed a uniﬁed evaluation framework based on the discussed properties of explanation and to the
hierarchical needs from developers and end-users. In this work, three tiered explanation evaluation architecture is
proposed corresponding to the three properties of explanation.

A similar work Felderer and Ramler [2021] discusses the importance of enhancing the quality of AI-based systems for a
practical usage. They afﬁrmed the importance of quality assurance to set benchmark for evaluations. Understandability
and interpretability, deﬁning expected outcomes as test oracles, and non-functional properties of AI-based systems of
AI models are among the seven challenges they listed to assure quality of AI-based systems.

7 Discussion

An extensive merit-oriented state-of-the-art review of iML is presented in this paper. We used a bottom-up approach to
categorize researches based on their primary importance. As shown in Table 1, robust machine learning, trustworthy
machine learning, and low resource machine learning are identiﬁed as the major themes to categorize research works
contributing to the state-of-the-art of iML. Signiﬁcant issues related to iML evaluation has also urged us to consider it
as one of the deﬁning factors of the state-of-the-art of iML.

Furthermore, these research works have been further classiﬁed under their technical and sectoral emphasis. We subsume
research works with speciﬁc component-wise and task-wise concentration under the technical section. Speciﬁcally,
as shown in Table 1, HCI and Interface design, iML visualization, and model explanability related research works
constitute the partial taxonomy of the technical section. Moreover, information processing class enclose research works
focusing on the use of iML for training data management in areas such as machine translation. Searching and retrieval
section contains iML inspired research works for search engine and retrieval systems. Adversarial attacks and iML
inspired defense strategies are put under security and privacy section. Interactive machine learning inspired researches
for low resource (pervasive) environment and clustering and optimization problems are classiﬁed under the technical
section of the merit-oriented taxonomy accordingly. On the other hand, papers with special emphasis on general sectors
like agriculture, health, game and development, and education are put under the sectoral section of the taxonomy.
Finally, research works that focus on multiple classes and are generic to the topic we are studying are put under the
other section of our iML taxonomy.

In the following sections, we discuss the major pillars of this state-of-the-art review. Moreover, the gaps identiﬁed in
the revised research works are discussed as research opportunities.

7.1 Robust Machine Learning

Tackling adversarial attacks has been one of the salient research areas in the areas of machine learning. Consequently,
a number of adversarial example attacks have been discovered with the intention of exposing potential gaps on the
learning models. However, such kind of approaches are reactive to solving robust machine learning.

From the attack surface perspective Papernot et al. [2016a], the nature of input perturbation Chen et al. [2017], Zhang
et al. [2019], Geiping et al. [2021], Carlini and Wagner [2017], Szegedy et al. [2013a], test perturbation Biggio et al.
[2013], Kwon et al. [2018a,b], and model exploitation Papernot et al. [2017], Brendel et al. [2017], Guo et al. [2019]
has been studied extensively.

As it is thoroughly discussed from section 3, iML has been extensively applied to address the problem of model
robustness. The methods against adversarial example attacks mainly basis on visualization of either the models
intermediate output, data instances, local structures Ma et al. [2019], Emamjomeh-Zadeh and Kempe [2017] or the
adversarial attacks Das et al. [2020], Morris et al. [2020], their masking techniques Slack et al. [2020] and visualization
of the system’s explanation Das et al. [2018].

Incorporation of an interactive component in the model building process is experimentally proved to have positive impact
on tackling input perturbation. Human-in-the-loop can help to identify intentionally created parametric and data instance
uncertainties. Similarly, users are observed to have successfully detecting either manipulated neurons (suppressed or
hyper-activated) or data instances. Accordingly, the human-in-the-loop feature of iML evidently contributes in detecting
adversarial attacks leading to the early enhancement of model robustness possible.

Given the increased complexity of adversarial attacks over-time and its subjective nature, the iML inspired research
outcomes at hand falls short to sustainably address the problem. The power of model visualization and users knowledge
towards advanced adversarial attacks should be studied to better solve the problem at hand.

7.2 Trustworthy Machine Learning

The most critical setback machine learning industry faces in recent years is a hampered applicability for decision
sensitive sectors like Health, Finance, Military, and Autonomous Robotics like autonomous driving. Scientists hesitate
to use standard machine learning for many trust-related reasons. The black-box nature of models, less control of
users over data instances and absence of guidelines to formalize the integration of exploratory components in standard

10

iML: A State of the Art Review

A PREPRINT

machine learning are some of the reasons behind its hampered application. Besides, the relatively bigger error margin
of standard machine learning algorithms and the small error sensitivity of models in the aforementioned sectors makes
it hard to conﬁdently employ standard machine learning algorithms.

To this end, we have reviewed research conducted to enhance trustworthiness of models. Put succinctly, we have
reiterated on the contribution of iML algorithms in enhancing the trustworthiness of iML algorithms.

Most iML inspired techniques utilizes state-of-the-art textual Mozina [2018], Turchetta et al. [2019] and visualization
components Van Den Elzen and Van Wijk [2011], Liu et al. [2017b], Zhao et al. [2018], Mühlbacher et al. [2014], Van
Den Elzen and Van Wijk [2011], Ambati [2011], Teso and Kersting [2019], Liu et al. [2017b], Zhao et al. [2018].

The salient works in the textual explanatory aspects of iML reiterates mainly on deriving techniques to explain and
interpret intermediate results of a model textually. The effectiveness of explanations mainly depends on their degree
of interpretability by the users. Techniques like Argument based Axiomatization Mozina [2018] and goal-oriented
safe-exploration Turchetta et al. [2019] has been reviewed as an important mechanisms to enhance the explanatory
capability of models in general. On the other hand, visual exploratory methods are also found to provide better insights
to complex models. Visualizations have been performed in either of intermediate results Teso and Kersting [2019] or
the explanations themselves Liu et al. [2017b], Zhao et al. [2018]. Correlations between data, intermediate results and
patterns among intermediate results have been used for visualization. Visualizations has also been applied to different
data structures. We have seen techniques to visualize decision tree structures Van Den Elzen and Van Wijk [2011] and
tree ensemble models through the use of multiple coordinated views Liu et al. [2017b], Zhao et al. [2018].

From the application point of view, it is demonstrated that iML inspired neuro-evolutionary algorithms boost trusts
among autonomous agents Gutzwiller and Reeder [2017]. Similarly, iML can also be used to increase the trustability of
models in the health sector Holzinger et al. [2018]. For instance, Kulesza et al. [2015] developed an explanation-centric
approach to help end users to effectively and efﬁciently personalize machine learning systems. It intends to increase end
users trust to a learning model by exposing the details of a learning model using an Explanatory debugging technique.

The other signiﬁcant problem we have examined from the model trustworthiness perspective is absence of guidelines
to build explanatory components. The employment of off-the-shelf interface design techniques resulted in poor
performance of the overall algorithm Bernardo et al. [2017]. To this end, some works Mühlbacher et al. [2014] are
conducted to set guidelines for integrating visualization into machine learning algorithms.

Besides, improving users experience can also boost its trustworthiness. In Bernardo et al. [2017], the importance of
iML to improve user experiences by supporting user-centred design processes is studied. Besides, they conclude that
there is a further role for user-centred design in improving interactive and classical machine learning systems.

From what we have revised, iML plays a vital role in introducing interactive learning and explainability.The fundamental
assumption in this regard is that the more transparent model gains higher degree of trust. However, some researches have
also tried to hypothesize an inverse relationship between trust and explainability Honeycutt et al. [2020]. Incidences
like this might happen if users don’t possess better understanding of black-box models and as a result focus on the
uncovered error margins of transparent models. Similar ﬁndings reafﬁrm the importance of undergoing empirical model
evaluations in addition to subjective ones in order to decide the trustworthiness of a given model.

Therefore, further researches on exploratory machine learning should be among the salient research problems in the iML
domain. Besides, the design of user experience for iML should be studied further as it contributes for the effectiveness
of the human-in-the-loop modality.

7.3 Low Resource Machine Learning

Machine learning consumes large data and resources in order to produce accurate models and undergone efﬁcient
performance evaluation. Generally, it is common knowledge that too little training data results in poor approximation.
For instance, no human would need several thousand images to learn numbers in another language, yet a fully connected
neural network needs too much data for good classiﬁcation of MNIST dataset. On the contrary, too little test data will
result in an optimistic and high variance estimation of model performance.

The amount of training data for machine learning has direct relationship with computing resources used to build
models. The more data poured to the model builder, the more computational resource it requires. As a result,
application of standard machine learning in resource constrained environments, more speciﬁcally in pervasive and
robotics environments, has become less realistic. Sectors like under-developed linguistics, medical science, ﬁnance
and military may not have sufﬁcient amount of data for the standard machine learning framework to produce accurate
outcome. Reducing the amount of data in these type of sectors compromises quality as the domain is sensitive to even
smaller error margins.

11

iML: A State of the Art Review

A PREPRINT

Consequently, machine learning algorithms has been modiﬁed in a way it engages users-in-the-loop. Besides, it
incorporates state-of-the-art visualization techniques to leverage users feed backs for data reduction and easing
computing resource requirements. To this end, iML plays a vital role.

As we have clearly analysed in the state-of-the-art review, iML takes advantage of users feedbacks on intermediate
results to reduce the amount of data and computational resources required to build well performing model. To this
end, various iML inspired researches have been conducted. iML tools has been employed to enable low resource
feature selection Fails and Olsen Jr [2003], Activity recognition in dynamic sensor setting Tegen et al. [2020], pattern
mining and matching in social network analysis Dzyuba et al. [2014], data exploitation Amershi et al. [2012] and
other applications. iML, especially its explanatory components, has been used to take advantage of some computing
architectures. For instance, as we have precisely covered in this document, integration of iML to Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) has been experimented for 3D virtual environments Frazier and Riedl [2019]. This shows how well
researchers recognized the importance of iML for resource constrained learning.

However, the contributions does not yet sufﬁce the problems at hand. That means, iML is not exploited enough for
critical demands of low resource learning especially in the area of robotics and pervasive computing. Robot simulation
Marco et al. [2017], low resource object recognition and tracking, navigation and natural language capabilities of
robots can be enhanced using iML inspired techniques. Therefore, exploiting iML for low resource machine learning
especially in the area of machine intelligence and simulation is identiﬁed as a promising area of research.

7.4

iML Performance Evaluation

iML comes along with its complications of performance measure. Performance of iML inspired algorithms can not
be effectively measured for two critical reasons namely: the subjectivity of users feedback and the co-operation and
co-adaptation or the two sided inﬂuence between users and the system. The subjective nature of users in iML inspired
model building makes it hard to put benchmarks for model evaluation Yang et al. [2019]. On the other hand, system
based feedbacks are prone to ill interpretability. Consequently, the empirical performance measuring techniques of
standard machine learning can not be exclusively used to assure the quality of iML inspired algorithms.

To this end some researches tried to address performance evaluation problems by addressing user’s and systems feedback
separately. Both the subjectivity of users feedback and degree of interpretability of systems explanation for a given
intermediate results contributes to the complex nature of iML evaluation. Therefore, a partial effort to address one
of these problems won’t provide the desired solution. Similarly, focusing on user-centeric performance evaluation
techniques does not sufﬁce the problem at hand.

To this end, a coupled performance evaluation technique that utilizes both subjective and empirical performance
evaluation techniques happens to yield better results Boukhelifa et al. [2018]. Interactive ranking of features Krause
et al. [2014] and more speciﬁcally diagnosis of instances to leverage measures of local feature relevance are studied
by different researchers. However, this area is still open for further research as there is no generalized and robust
performance evaluation technique for iML as there is for statistical machine learning algorithms.

8 Conclusion and Future Works

We have seen how iML presents interesting challenges and prospects to conduct future research; not only in terms
of designing robust algorithms and interaction techniques, but also in terms of coherent evaluation methodologies.
Consequently, an extensive review of the state-of-the-art of iML is conducted in this paper.

From the tabular representation of iML inspired research works, shown in Table 1, it is clear that iML has not been
exhaustively applied to areas such as searching and retrieval, pervasive computing and robotics, and clustering and
optimization tasks. Moreover, although the importance of iML in decision-sensitive areas such as agriculture, health,
education, game and entertainment is evidential, we have seen very few contributions in this regard.

Consequently, we have come to a conclusion that the domain of machine learning has not yet exploited the power
of iML features and the human exhaustively. The merits of iML have not yet been fully enriched for contemporary
machine learning algorithms. Identifying gaps and approaching them with state-of-the-art methods should be the
primary goal iML researchers. To this end, we summarize potential research problems that we believe are inspiring for
future work in iML as follows:

12

A PREPRINT

8.1 Adversarial Attack Defense

As per our analysis under the section of robust machine learning, the primary source of adversarial attacks is black-box
nature of algorithms and bulk use of data. Interactive machine learning should further be studied in this aspect as it is
evidently an efﬁcient approach for small data and exploratory machine learning.

Further researches should be conducted to leverage the human-in-the-loop feature and suppress any training-phase and
test-phase adversarial attacks. The engagement of the user in the model building pipeline will presumably reduce the
degree of severity adversarial attacks against machine learning models.

8.2 Degree of User Engagement

The degree of users engagement in an interactive model building process is not well-deﬁned. This may detrimentally
affect model accuracy and overall performance as clearly presented in Honeycutt et al. [2020]. Therefore, a separate
effort to set the degree of user engagement while building robust and trustworthy models should be researched
thoroughly.

8.3 Exploratory Machine Learning

As we have discussed in the previous sections, empowering machine learning algorithms with exploratory features is a
fundamental step towards transparent, trustworthy, and accurate model based computation.

However, providing explanations and interpretations on intermediate results of a model a critical problem until now.
Not much work has been done in integrating iML features with contemporary machine learning algorithms. Therefore,
we recommend further researches in building exploratory machine learning frameworks.

8.4 Low Resource Learning

Resource constrained learning is among the critical problems a machine learning industry face these days. The increased
pervasiveness of computing nodes and the scarcity of data affected the applicability of machine learning signiﬁcantly.
Besides, the need for real time learning increased overtime. One important way to overcome this problem and ensure
the applicability of machine learning in low resource machines is a systematic employment of iML. Especially, as
we it is seen in our analysis, more effort on iML would enable real time learning on robots and other low resource
agentsMordatch et al. [2015]. Furthermore, complex tasks like object detection, recognition and tracking, saliency
identiﬁcation, face and emotion recognition, natural language processing, robot navigation and simulation can be
signiﬁcantly enhanced with less data and computational resource by using interactive machine learning.

8.5 User Experience

The essence of interactive machine learning to engage users in the model building process and as a result obtain
advantage of it. This can only be achieved if we provide a good user experience for the user subject to advise the
learning model. To this end, user experience design plays a vital role.

Designing user interfaces using state-of-the-art design methods and in conformance with the speciﬁc requirements of
iML algorithms Dudley and Kristensson [2018]. This allows experts outside the machine learning domain use machine
learning algorithms to solve problems at their domain of expertise without much agony.

8.6

iML Performance Evaluation

Performance evaluation is one of the complications brought to the world of machine learning along with iML. The
subjective, co-operation and co-adaptation nature of iML makes it hard to set benchmarks for performance evaluation.
Therefore, we suggest further researching to enhance performance evaluation techniques for iML.
