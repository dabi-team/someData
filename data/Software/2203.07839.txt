In a recent work [C. Chevalier, B. M. Wong, Comput. Phys. Commun. 274, 108299 (2022); arXiv:
2203.05233 [cond-mat.mes-hall]] the interesting and popular problem was considered. Authors at-
tempted to solve the self-consistent Schr¨odinger-Poisson problem for an eﬀective mass electron in a
core-shell semiconductor nanowire. The corresponding MATLAB-based software package was pre-
sented. However, an incorrect solution of the Schr¨odinger equation invalidates the whole result.
Here we point out the corresponding error and possible ways to ﬁx it.

In recent years, many calculations of the spectrum
of charge carriers and wave functions in semiconductor
nanowires (NWs) have been made [1–5], including those
in core-shell structures. In this context, an emergence of
a tool that allows one to calculate the electronic states
in the core-shell NWs is very useful and timely. Such
a tool appeared quite recently [6]. This free software is
based on MATLAB and is called HADOKEN (High-level
Algorithms to Design, Optimize, and Keep Electrons in
Nanowires). However, the solution of the spectral prob-
lem in Ref. 6 was incorrect. This led to the incorrectness
of the whole self-consistent Schr¨odinger-Poisson proce-
dure. In this Comment we point out the corresponding
error and possible ways to ﬁx it.

The eﬀective mass Hamiltonian for an electron of sim-
ple isotropic conduction band in a core-shell NW is given
by

¯h2
2 ∇

−

(1)

H =

+ VT (x, y),

1
m∗(x, y) ∇
where m∗(x, y) is the coordinate-dependent eﬀective
mass, and VT (x, y) is the total potential, including the
quantum conﬁnement due to the conduction band pro-
ﬁle in a core-shell heterostructure and the electrostatic
potential. Since the translational invariance in the NW-
axis direction (the z-axis) is conserved, we can write the
envelope wave function in the following form

Ψnk(x, y, z) =

1
√L

eikz ψn(x, y).

(2)

Here ¯hk is the longitudinal momentum and n enumer-

ates the one-dimensional subbands.

Substituting this wave function into the Schr¨odinger

equation, HΨ = EΨ, we ﬁnd

ψn(x, y) = Eψn(x, y).

One can see, that, due to the position-dependent ef-
fective mass, the variables are not separated. In order to
ﬁnd the subband energy spectrum one have to solve the
problem numerically for each ﬁxed k value. The energy
eigenvalue is En(k), and the corresponding eigenfunction
can be rewritten as ψn(x, y; k), which indicates a para-
metric dependence on k. A possible solution of this prob-
lem for an electron in core-multi-shell NW structure was
discussed in Ref. 7.

However, the authors of Ref. 6 wrote a very strange
answer. They formally separated longitudinal and trans-
verse motion, and wrote: En(k) = En + Ez, where En is
the n-th subband bottom energy and Ez = ¯h2k2
2m∗(x,y) . The
dependence of the eigenvalue on the spatial variables is
a very strange answer!!!

Thus, the above two things [(i) an incorrectly found
energy spectrum and (ii) an unaccounted for parametric
dependence of the wave function on the longitudinal mo-
mentum] lead to a wrong result, starting with Eq. (14)
of Ref. 6.

In the case of a step-like eﬀective mass proﬁle, when
mc and ms are the eﬀective masses of the core and shell
material, respectively, the energy spectrum can be found
in the form

En(k) = En +

¯h2k2
2m∗
n

,

(4)

where En is again the subband bottom energy, and m∗
n
is the n-th subband eﬀective mass, which, due to the
penetration of the wave function into the barrier regions,
c and m∗
is something between m∗
s.
Taking into account the above corrections, Eq. (15) of
Ref. 6 should be replaced by (here the notation of Ref. 6
is used)

where f (E, µ, T ) is the Fermi distribution function, µ
and T are the chemical potential and temperature, re-
spectively. Such corrections, apparently, complicate the
numerical calculation, but make it correct.

I guess that appropriate changes should be made in the
code of the HADOKEN software. Moreover, the Com-
puter Physics Communications and its library allow to
improve the software code.
