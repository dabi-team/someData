We provide an overview of the xFitter open-source software package, review the general capabilities
of the program, and highlight applications relevant to the Snowmass study. An updated version
of the program (2.2.0) is available on CERN GitLab,a and this has been updated to a C++
codebase with enhanced and extended features. We also discuss some of the ongoing and future code
developments that may be useful for precision studies. We survey recent analyses performed by the
xFitter developers’ team including: W and Z production, photon PDFs, Drell-Yan forward-backward
asymmetry studies, resummation of small-x contributions, heavy quark production, constraints on
the strange PDF, determination of the pion PDF, and determination of the pion Fragmentation
Functions. Finally, we brieﬂy summarize selected applications of xFitter in the literature. The
xFitter program is a versatile, ﬂexible, modular, and comprehensive tool that can provide impact
studies for possible future facilities. We encourage the use of xFitter, and welcome new contributions
from the community.

INTRODUCTION TO xFitter

A. xFitter Overview

Tevatron, and LHC. It is also possible to add new custom
data sets such as LHeC [14] and EIC [15, 16]) pseudo-
data.

xFitter [1] (formerly HERAﬁtter) is an open-source
software package that provides a framework for the
determination of the parton distribution functions
(PDFs) of the proton and related subjects.1
xFitter
version 2.0.1 is currently available, and version 2.2.0
will be released imminently and oﬀers an expanded
It incorporates experimental
set of tools and options.
data from a wide range of experiments including ﬁxed-
target, Tevatron, HERA, and LHC data sets. xFitter
can analyze this data using predictions up to next-
to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) in perturbation theory
with a variety of theoretical calculations including
numerous methodological options
for carrying out
PDF ﬁts and plotting tools which help visualize
the results. While primarily based on the collinear
factorization foundation, xFitter also provides facilities
for ﬁts of dipole models and transverse-momentum
dependent (TMD) distributions. The package can be
used to study the impact of new precise measurements
from hadron colliders, and also assess the impact of
future colliders. This paper provides a brief overview
of xFitter with emphasis of the features relevant for the
Snowmass2021 study.

The need for precision PDFs: The PDFs are the
essential components that allow us to make theoretical
predictions for experimental measurements of collider
experiments with initial state protons and hadrons.
Despite the recent progress of PDF analyses (including
NLO and NNLO calculations), the uncertainty for many
precision measurements at the LHC stems nowadays
primarily from the PDFs [2–4]. Hence, our ability to
fully characterize the Higgs boson and constrain Beyond-
Standard-Model (BSM) physics signatures ultimately
comes down to how accurately we determine the
underlying PDFs; this is the focus of the xFitter project.

Open Source Code: The xFitter package is provided
at www.xFitter.org, and a write-up of the program
can be found in Ref. [1], and an overview of available
tutorials in Ref. [5] including some presented at MCnet-
CTEQ schools. The xFitter framework has already
been used for more than 100+ analyses including many
LHC studies.
The code structure of the xFitter
package is modular, and it allows for various theoretical
and methodological options.
Currently it contains
interfaces to QCDNUM [6], APFEL [7, 8], LHAPDF [9],
APPLGRID [10], APFELGRID [11], FastNLO [12],
HATHOR [13], among other packages.

xFitter also has a large number of data sets available,
including a variety of ﬁxed target experiments, HERA,

B. xFitter Capabilities

PDF Fits & Analysis: First and foremost, xFitter
provides a ﬂexible open-source framework for performing
PDF ﬁts to data. The PDFs are the fundamental object
that xFitter works with, and it has a variety of utilities
to read, write, and manipulate the standardized PDF
ﬁle format and associated uncertainties. For example,
xFitter is able to read and write PDFs in the LHAPDF6
format [9].

xFitter-draw: xFitter can also automatically generate
comparison plots of data vs. theory. There are a variety
of options for the deﬁnition of the χ2 function and the
treatment of experimental uncertainties. Examples are
presented in Ref. [1].

Nuclear PDFs:
xFitter has also been extended to
produce nuclear PDFs; this was used to produce the
TUJU19 nPDF set of Ref. [17].

Pion PDFs:
and Ref. [18] illustrates this for the case of pion PDFs.

xFitter can also produce meson PDFs,

Pseudo-Data: An important application of xFitter is
to understand how a particular data set or experiment
will impact the PDFs. A typical study might be to use
pseudo-data from a proposed experiment (e.g. LHeC
or EIC) to constrain the relative uncertainty on the
underlying PDFs. For example, Ref. [19] used LHeC
pseudo-data to constrain the strange PDF with charged-
current DIS charm production data.
Additionally,
forward-backward Drell-Yan asymmetry pseudo-data
were prepared to simulate the end of Run-II LHC (i.e.
300 f b−1), and also the HL-LHC; these pseudo-data have
been used for PDF proﬁling in Refs. [3] and [20].

xFitter

Proﬁling & Reweighting:
is able to
perform PDF proﬁling and reweighting studies. The
reweighting method allows xFitter
to update the
probability distribution of a PDF uncertainty set (such as
a set of NNPDF replicas) to reﬂect the inﬂuence of new
data. For the PDF proﬁling, xFitter compares data and
MC predictions based on the χ2-minimization, and then
constrains the individual PDF eigenvector sets taking
into account the data uncertainties. For example, Ref. [2]
used the Tevatron W -boson charge asymmetry and of
the Z-boson production cross sections data to study the
impact on the PDFs using Hessian proﬁling and Bayesian
reweighting techniques.

In a separate

forward-backward
asymmetry in neutral current Drell-Yan production
provides powerful constraints on the valence quark PDFs,
and this in turn can impact both SM [21, 22] and
BSM [23, 24] physics.

the

NNLO & QED PDFs: As many PDF analyses are
now extended out to NNLO, the NLO QED eﬀects can
also become important. For example, including QED
processes in the parton evolution will break the isospin
symmetry as the up and down quarks have diﬀerent
couplings to the photon. xFitter is able to include NLO
QED eﬀects, and this is illustrated in Ref. [25] which
computes the photon PDF as determined using a NNLO
QCD and NLO QED analysis.

(TMD)

Transverse-momentum-dependent distributions:
Transverse-momentum-dependent
parton
distribution functions
encode nonperturbative
[26]
information on hadron structure, extending to the
transverse plane the one-dimensional picture given
by collinear PDFs, and providing a 3D imaging of
hadron structure. Similarly to collinear PDFs, TMDs
can be parameterised and ﬁtted to experimental data.
Within the xFitter framework, the extraction of TMDs
from ﬁts to experimental data has been carried out
in the cases of CCFM evolution [27–29] and Parton
Branching evolution [30–32]. xFitter is able to write and
manipulate TMDs in the TMDlib format [33, 34].

The Leading-Log ln(1/x)

Small-x resummation:
xFitter can also study the
impact of the ln(1/x)-resummation corrections to the
DGLAP splitting functions and DIS coeﬃcient functions.
The resummation formalism for both the splitting
functions and the coeﬃcient functions is developed
in [35].
[36–39]
and Next-to-Leading-Log ln(1/x) (NLLx) [35, 40–42]
resummed calculations are implemented in the public
code HELL [43, 44]. The phenomenological eﬀects of the
ln(1/x) resummation are investigated in Ref. [45]. In a
related study [46], a more ﬂexible PDF parameterisation
is used with xFitter which provides a better description
of the combined inclusive HERA I+II data, expecially at
low x.

(LLx)

Pole & M S running masses: Another feature of
xFitter is the ability to handle both pole masses and
M S running masses. While the pole mass is more closely
connected to what is measured in experiments, the M S
mass has advantages on the theoretical side of improved
perturbative convergence. xFitter was used to perform a
high precision determination of the M S charm mass in
this new framework [47].

Dipole models: We have several dipole models [48–50]
implemented in xFitter which describe HERA inclusive
and diﬀractive DIS cross sections very well and are a
natural description of QCD reaction in the low x and low
Q2 region, ﬁts to HERA data are shown in [51, 52]. The
gluon distribution [52] determined from dipole model in
xFitter can be applied to the description of selected LHC
processes such as gamma-proton and nucleus-nucleus
collisions [53, 54].

C. xFitter and Snowmass2021

We brieﬂy discuss how xFitter might contribute
to some of the future projects being studied in the
Snowmass2021 planning process.

LHC & HL-LHC: The xFitter package has been used
for more than 100 analyses including many LHC studies;
a more complete list is available at www.xFitter.org.
Applying this work to data taken at HL-LHC is a natural
extension.

To highlight just one LHC example, the strange quark
PDF has generated considerable attention in the recent
literature. There is a comprehensive study [55] that
examines the compatibility of both the ATLAS [56, 57]
and CMS [58] data in a uniform framework using the
xFitter program.

EIC & LHeC: The EIC [59] and LHeC [14] facilities
will provide lepton–nucleon scattering in a collider
conﬁguration with a variety of beams.

In addition to exploring the proton PDFs, these
colliders can also study nuclear PDFs with nuclear
beams, and also meson (pion & kaon) structure via
xFitter is capable of
leading neutron production.
studying both nuclear PDFs [17] and meson PDFs [18].
Additionally, xFitter can also compute the transverse
momentum dependent (TMD) distributions [1].

DUNE: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment
(DUNE) will use an intense neutrino beam generated
at Fermilab to study open questions about neutrino
oscillations. The massive DUNE detectors will also
contribute to the study of proton decay and Grand
Uniﬁed Theories, as well as observe neutrino signals from
supernova core-collapse [60].

Improvements in PDF nuclear correction factors and the
generation of nuclear PDFs ﬁt, speciﬁcally to neutrino–
nucleus interactions in the relevant energy range, can
help minimize systematic errors for the +30% fraction of
DUNE events coming from the DIS region. This would
enhance analyses in both the near and far detectors.
Thus,
improvements by xFitter on both proton and
nuclear PDFs [17] can contribute to the DUNE project.

UHE Cosmic Rays Recent advances in neutrino
astronomy have
study ultra-high
energy cosmic rays (UHECR) by studying atmospheric
neutrinos. For example, IceCube [62, 63] has isolated
more than 100 high-energy cosmic neutrinos, with
energies between 100 TeV and 10 PeV.

to

Interpretation of these measurements would beneﬁt
from accurate PDFs in the low-x region. An example
application is the evaluation of the prompt ﬂux of
atmospheric neutrinos originating from the semileptonic
decays of heavy-ﬂavored hadrons produced in the
interactions of UHECR with nuclei in the atmosphere [64,

65]. The prompt atmospheric-neutrino ﬂux represents
a relevant background for searches of highly energetic
increased precision of both
cosmic neutrinos. Thus,
PDFs and nuclear corrections in the very low-x region
would improve theoretical predictions in this extreme
kinematic region.

xFitter plans to provide PDF sets

resummation-scale technique [71, 72].

NLO EW corrections are important at the precision
level of the Drell-Yan measurements at the LHC and
the Tevatron. Complete one-loop EW corrections for NC
and CC Drell-Yan processes are realized in ReneSANCe
Monte Carlo event generator that uses the SANC
modules for diﬀerential cross-sections. The predictions
obtained by ReneSANCe were thoroughly cross-checked
with the results of MCSANC integrator. The complete
one-loop EW corrections can be separated in the code
into weak, QED FSR, QED ISR and interference (IFI)
contributions. The dominant part of the higher-order
EW corrections is QED FSR which can be modelled
by PHOTOS program.
The eﬀects of QED FSR
calculated by PHOTOS and ReneSANCe agree very
well. The K-factors for the remaining parts of NLO
EW can be computed with ReneSANCe for various
diﬀerential cross sections, AF B and charge asymmetries:

In the case of NC DY the separation of the FSR
contribution is straightforward and appears at the level
of Feynman diagrams. But the corresponding separation
in the case of CC DY is not trivial and it is even not gauge
invariant. For the sake of agreement with PHOTOS, a
special prescription for this separation was introduced in
SANC modules.

III. OVERVIEW OF RECENT XFITTER
RESULTS

A. W and Z Boson Production

In Reference [2], the xFitter collaboration (formerly
HERAFitter) analyzed measurements of the W-boson
charge asymmetry and of the Z-boson production cross
sections, performed at the Tevatron collider in Run II
by the D0 and CDF collaborations. Figure 1 shows the
comparison of the relative uncertainty of the PDFs using
the HERA I data alone, and together with the Tevatron
W/Z data. This new data signiﬁcantly reduces the PDF
uncertainty, and this is most noticeable for the case of
the d-valence, as shown.

(xFitter epHMDY) with the corresponding results from
NNPDF3.0qed [73], LUXqed [74] and HKR16 [75]. The PDF
uncertainties are shown at the 68% CL obtained from the
MC method, while model and parametrisation uncertainties
are addressed separately. For HKR16 only the central value
is shown, while for LUXqed the associated PDF uncertainty
band is included. Figure from Ref. [25].

determinations from the literature.

To include the photon PDF, xFitter links to the
APFEL program [7] to incorporate NLO QED eﬀects.
The inclusion of NLO QED evolution eﬀects are
cross checked using the independent QEDEVOL [77]
code based on the QCDNUM [6] evolution program.
Additionally, the aMCfast interface [78] is used to include
the photon-initiated contributions in the EW calculations
within MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [79].

≤

The resulting photon PDF determination represents an
important validation of our understanding on the nature
and implications of the photon PDF. Fig. 2 shows the
results as compared with other recent QED ﬁts. For
x
0.1, the four determinations of the photon PDF are
consistent within uncertainties. For smaller values of x,
the photon PDF from LUXqed and HKR16 is somewhat
smaller than xFitter epHMDY, but still in agreement
at the 2-σ level. This agreement is further improved
if the PDF uncertainties in xFitter epHMDY arising
from variations of the input parametrisation are added
to experimental uncertainties. Moreover, the results of
this work and NNPDF3.0QED agree at the 68% CL
for x
0.03, and the agreement extends to smaller
values of x once the parametrisation uncertainties in
xFitter epHMDY are accounted for. The LUXqed and
the HKR16 calculations of xγ(x, Q2) are very close to
each other across the entire range of x.

The results of this study have been made possible by
a number of technical developments that should be of

To study the possible model dependence due to the
W-boson rapidity reconstruction, an alternative ﬁt was
performed in which the W-boson charge asymmetries
measured by CDF and D0 were excluded, and the latest
D0 measurement of the electron asymmetry was included.
In Fig. 1, the ﬁt to the lepton asymmetry data (green
band) yields very compatible results to the W-boson
asymmetry data (yellow band), but the uncertainties on
the dv PDF are up to twice as large.

for fast theory calculations, are publicly available on the

direct application for future PDF ﬁts accounting for QED
corrections. These technical improvements will certainly
be helpful for future studies of the photon PDF of the
proton.

C. The Forward-Backward Asymmetry in Neutral
Current Drell-Yan Production

The DY-induced lepton charge asymmetry in charged
current (CC) processes has been an eﬀective way to
constrain PDFs. Ref. [3] examines the use of neutral
current (NC) lepton charge asymmetry measurements,
which are traditionally used in the context of precision
determinations of the weak mixing angle θW , to obtain
improved PDF constraints.

interfaced to APPLgrid [10]

Speciﬁcally, a forward-backward asymmetry A∗
F B is
computed at NLO using the MadGraph5 aMC@NLO
program [79]
through
aMCfast [78]. The A∗
F B is sensitive to valence quark
PDFs through the combination of chiral couplings
(2/3uV + 1/3dV ). The valence quark PDFs in turn
also inﬂuence the sea PDF constraints via the sum rule
relations.

For this study, three sets of pseudodata relevant for
LHC Run 2, 3, and HL-LHC were considered. Fig 3
displays the impact of the data on the valence quark
PDFs and their combination weighted by their electric
charges, for 30, 300 and 3000 fb−1. Comparing those
proﬁled error bands, we note a visible improvement in the
distribution of the valence quark PDFs, especially in the
region of small x. Some improvement in the high x region
of quark PDFs can be obtained employing suﬃciently
large data samples and applying suitable rapidity cuts

within the conventional DGLAP framework of QCD have
shown some tension at low x and low Q2. Our goal
was to determine whether incorporating the ln(1/x)-
resummation terms into the HERAPDF ﬁts might help
resolve these tensions.

×

While the details are presented in Ref. [45], in brief
it was observed that the total χ2 for the ﬁts improved
from 1468/1207 for the NNLO ﬁt, to 1394/1207 for the
NNLO+NNLLx ﬁt. The nominal improvement of the
total χ2 reﬂects the fact that the small x data is only
a portion of the full data set; however, the impact in
the small x region is signiﬁcant as indicated in Fig. 4
where we see the ln(1/x) contributions yield an improved
ﬁt for the longitudinal structure function in the small x
and low Q2 region. The precise kinematic region where
this resummation is important is delineated in Fig. 11 of
Ref. [45].

Additionally, the resummation yields a larger gluon
PDF in the small x and low Q2 region, and this
avoids potential problems due to a negative gluon PDF
in forward physics. These features make PDFs with
ln(1/x) resummation much more suitable for use in MC
generators, such as Sherpa [81].

provides
substantial improvement in the description of the precise
HERA1+2 combined data. The NLLx contributions
yield an improved description of the data, especially the
longitudinal structure function FL in the small x region,
as compared to both the (un-resummed) NLO and
NNLO analysis, and it also avoids potential problems of
the negative gluon PDF at low x and Q2.

E. Heavy quark matching scales: Unifying the
FFNS and VFNS

High precision phenomenological analysis of DIS data
requires a proper treatment of the heavy quarks mass
scales. The Variable Flavor Number Scheme (VFNS)
incorporates the heavy quark mass scale across the full
kinematic range by varying the number of active ﬂavors
(NF ) in the DGLAP QCD evolution. In the VFNS, the
matching scale µm determines the transition from NF
to NF + 1 active ﬂavors. Historically, µm was taken to
be the heavy quark mass mH ; however, this choice is
not required, and there are advantages to using a ﬂexible
matching scale. This feature is implemented in xFitter
via the APFEL code, and we demonstrate the beneﬁts in
Ref. [82].

An essential element of this analysis is to implement
the correction matching of the PDFs across the ﬂavor
threshold. The matching conditions have been computed
to NLO and NNLO within the xFitter code, and the
impact of this choice on the physical structure function
F b
2 (x, Q) is illustrated in Fig. 5. We emphasize some key
features illustrated in the matching conditions.

Ref. [82] illustrates the use of the variable matching
scale for the case of heavy quark (charm and bottom)
production at HERA. The ﬂexibility of choosing the
µm matching scale provides a number of advantages.
By adjusting the matching scale, we can eﬀectively
transition between a VFNS and a FFNS in a seamless
manner. For example, µm=mb would correspond to the

On a more practical level, this ﬂexibility allows one
to shift the matching scale so that the discontinuities
associated with the NF to NF + 1 transition do not lie
in the middle of a speciﬁc data set.

In summary, the ﬂexibility of choosing the heavy
ﬂavor matching scale µm generalizes the transition
between a FFNS and a VFNS, and provides a theoretical
“laboratory” which can quantitatively test proposed
implementations. The ability to vary the heavy ﬂavor
matching scales not only provides new insights into the
intricacies of QCD, but also has practical advantages for

the potential improvement from a future DIS facility.
As xFitter implements both ﬁxed-ﬂavor- and variable-
ﬂavor-number schemes, we also compared the impact
of these diﬀerent theoretical choices to highlight several
interesting aspects of multi-scale calculations.

∼

For the LHeC parameters, we assumed a 7 TeV
proton beam on a 60 GeV electron beam yielding
√s
1.3 TeV with a nominal design luminosity of
1033cm−2 s−1. Compared to HERA, this extends the
covered kinematic range by an order of magnitude in
both xBj and Q2. The predictions are provided for

Using the high-statistics pseudodata with the xFitter
analysis, we ﬁnd strong constraints on the strange-
quark PDF, especially in the previously unexplored
small-xBj
Figure 6 illustrates the relative
improvement of the strange PDF uncertainty using the
ABMP16 PDFs [84]. The general reduction of the PDF
uncertainties is evident across the full x range. We also
performed calculations using the NNPDF3.1 PDFs [85]
and obtained similar conclusions.

As xFitter can compute in both the Fixed Flavor
(FFNS) Variable Flavor Number
Number Scheme
Scheme (VFNS), we investigated the diﬀerences due the
the scheme choice. We computed the reduced cross
section using both the FFNS and VFNS, and then cut
out those pseudodata where the scheme uncertainty was
larger than the PDF uncertainty.
In Fig. 6 this result
(in blue) is labeled as “proﬁled with cuts.” If we include
all the data (labeled, “proﬁled all data”) we obtain the
uncertainty band labeled in green. Comparing these two
results, we ﬁnd that the pseudodata can impose very
strong constraints on the PDFs and this is independent
of the particular heavy-ﬂavor scheme.

G. The Pion PDF

The study of heavy quark production plays a critical
role enabling us to fully characterize the properties of
the SM. The charm quark is especially useful in this
respect as the combination of ﬁxed-target and collider
data allow us to investigate the full kinematic spectrum

current charm production provides direct access to the
strange quark distribution. The strange PDF is of
particular interest because it still has large uncertainties
despite being extensively investigated in a number of
experiments such as inclusive W/Z production and W +c
associated production. Looking to the future, it is clearly
important to reduce the uncertainty of the PDFs in
general, and the strange-quark in particular, as we strive
to make increasingly precise tests of the SM.

Fig. 7 presents the ﬁtted pion PDFs and compares
with results from JAM [86] and GRVPI1 [87]. In general,
the results obtained from xFitter compare favorably to
JAM within uncertainties, but do show diﬀerences with
the older GRV analysis. For the uncertainty bands, the
µR and µF renormalization scales were varied, as well as
the PDF parameter values. For the valence distribution,
the dominant uncertainty is the scale variation, and
this is rather well constrained. For the sea and gluon
distributions, the calculation only included the direct
photons in the model; hence, the missing fragmentation
contribution to the prompt photon production process
is the dominant uncertainty source. This is certainly an
issue to be improved in a future analysis.

To further illustrate the ﬂexibility of the xFitter
framework, both a 3-parameter and 4-parameter form
for the initial valence distribution was used. This type of
parameter ﬂexibility is crucial as it allows, for example,
the investigation of the PDF slope in the large x limit.

While this study demonstrated the versatility of
xFitter to perform meson PDF analysis,
there are
numerous directions this work can be extended. For
example, new J/Ψ data could play an important role
in constraining the gluon [88], and data from future
experiments such as COMPASS++/AMBER [89], may
allow for more ﬂexible parameterizations and improved
constraints.

H. The Pion Fragmentation Function

In addition to pion PDFs, xFitter can also compute
pion fragmentation functions. Reference [90] presents
the ﬁrst open-source analysis of fragmentation functions
of charged pions (entitled IPM-xFitter) computed at
next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading

pion by the BELLE collaboration.

A primary goal of this analysis was to investigate
the inﬂuence of the BELLE13 [91], BELLE20 [92], and
BaBar [93] data sets on the resulting fragmentation
functions. A total of ﬁve ﬁts were generated using
diﬀerent data combinations and diﬀerent kinematic cuts.
1) Fit A focused on the impact of the BELLE13 data
set without BELLE20; 2) Fit B used the BELLE20 data
set without BELLE13; 3) Fit C used the BELLE20 data
set without BaBar; 4) Fit D focused the impact of the
BELLE20 data set without either BELLE13 or BaBar,
and imposed a z>0.2 cut on the BELLE20; 5) Fit E
excluded BELLE13 but included BELLE20 with a z>0.2
cut, and BaBar with a z>0.1 cut.

Comparisons of selected ﬁts are displayed in Fig. 8
along with results from the literature. The diﬀerent
ﬁts are in reasonable agreement for larger z values,
but begin to diverge for smaller z. Note, discretion is
necessary when interpreting the very low z region as the
extrapolation of the fragmentation function grids extends
beyond the region ﬁtted in the individual analyses. For

In Ref.
[111], the ATLAS Collaboration performed a
PDF ﬁt including for the ﬁrst time measurements for the
production of W and Z boson in association with a jet,
resulting in the ATLASepWZVjets20 PDF set. The V
+ jets data are sensitive to partons at higher x than can
be accessed by inclusive W, Z/γ∗ data and, in particular,
they constrain the ¯d and ¯s quarks at higher x.
And more recently an ATLAS PDF ﬁt [112] was
performed including a variety of measurements of
diﬀerent production processes (Drell-Yan, V+jets, direct
photon production, t¯t and inclusive jets data) at diﬀerent
center-of-mass energies. The resulting set of PDFs is
called ATLASpdf21.

This study generally found good quality for the ﬁts
across most of the z range, but the description of the
data in the low-z region remains an unresolved puzzle.
The resulting NLO and NNLO pion FFs provide valuable
insights for applications in present and future high-

IV. APPLICATIONS OF xFitter

A. Usage of xFitter by LHC Collaborations

xFitter is the standard tool for QCD analyses by the
ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the LHC, resulting
in a number of diﬀerent studies.

xFitter has been used to quantify the sensitivity to
PDFs of diﬀerential W and Z bosons [95–98] and of
W+charm quark [99, 100] cross-section measurements,
showing how they provide important constraints on
the strangeness content of the proton. Other studies
have illustrated the gluon PDF sensitivity of t¯t cross-
sections measurements [101–103]. An ATLAS study [104]
t¯t/Z
highlighted cross-section ratios,
measured at diﬀerent energies, as a powerful quantity to
probe the gluon/sea PDF ratio free of large experimental
uncertainties.

such as

for

The xFitter capabilities to perform coherent analysis
of PDFs plus additional parameters of interest, has been
exploited to measure SM parameters which correlate
with PDFs. The t¯t cross-sections have been used for
extractions of the top quark mass [105–107], which
for the CMS analyses has been done simultaneously
with a determination of the strong coupling and of
the PDFs.
Simultaneous extractions of the strong
coupling with the PDFs have been performed by CMS
also from inclusive jets [108, 109] and dijet [110] cross-
sections, recently extended to determinations of the
contribution of SMEFT operators introducing new four-
fermion interactions simultaneously with the PDFs [109].
[97], high precision measurements of the
inclusive diﬀerential W ± and Z/γ∗ boson cross sections
at 7 TeV were added to the HERA data, resulting
in the PDF set ATLASepWZ16, which improved on
the HERAPDF2.0 set in various respects. Firstly, the
strange content of the sea was determined rather than
assumed to be a ﬁxed fraction of the light sea. Indeed,
compared to previous determinations, the strange sea
was found to be enhanced at low x.
Secondly, the
accuracy of the valence quark distributions for x < 0.1

this increased
the number of ﬁtting parameters, and these changes

in the

data sets depend on the nuclear A and Z, so this
information was provided within the data ﬁles and
the input/output routines were modiﬁed accordingly.
Finally, the DGLAP evolution code was modiﬁed to
evolve nuclear PDFs covering diﬀerent combinations of
A and Z individually. These modiﬁcations included a
new numerical integration routine to accommodate the
ﬂexibility of an A-dependent normalization.

D. BSM Physics with xFitter

The capabilities of xFitter can be exploited for studies

of new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).

Consider for instance BSM experimental searches at
the LHC in dielectron/dimuon channels and charged
lepton plus missing transverse energy channels. These
are classic methods to search for new Z (cid:48)/W (cid:48) gauge
bosons:
see for example the analyses by ATLAS in
Refs. [136, 137] and by CMS in Refs. [138, 139]. Such
searches will be further pursued at the High-Luminosity
LHC (HL-LHC) [140].

In the case of BSM scenarios with narrow vector
resonances one can rely on traditional “bump search”
analyses based on the Breit-Wigner (BW) lineshape. In
the case of BSM scenarios featuring vector resonances
with large width, on the other hand, the default bump
instead of an easily
searches are likely not suﬃcient:
observable narrow BW lineshape, the resonance appears
as a broad shoulder spreading over the SM background.
Alternative experimental approaches can be applied to
the case of wide resonances, in which one has to exploit
the tails of the measured mass distributions. Examples of
such approaches include for instance “counting strategy”
analyses. These approaches are much more dependent
than bump searches on the modeling of the dominant
production process [141], for both signal and background.
in the case of wide-resonance searches the
role of PDFs becomes prominent as one of the main
sources of theoretical systematic uncertainties, because
it directly aﬀects our ability to test BSM scenarios
and the experimental sensitivity to new physics. This
thus inﬂuences the potential of experimental searches for
discovering or setting exclusion bounds on heavy BSM
states.

Then,

In the multi-TeV region of W (cid:48)/Z (cid:48) masses deﬁned
by the current LHC exclusion limits [136–139], quark
distributions in the valence sector dominate the PDF
systematics. With an xFitter proﬁling analysis, Ref. [142]
ﬁnds that the valence quark systematics can be improved
by combining high-precision measurements of Charged
Current (CC) and Neutral Current (NC) Drell-Yan
asymmetries in the mass region near the SM weak boson
poles. This exploits the sensitivity of the NC forward-
backward asymmetry AFB to the charge-weighted linear
combination (2/3)uV + (1/3)dV of up-quark and down-
quark valence distributions [3] and the sensitivity of the
CC lepton-charge asymmetry AW to the diﬀerence uV

uncertainty due to AFB and AW precision measurements
at the SM weak boson mass scale,
result into an
enhancement of the experimental sensitivity to BSM
searches at the TeV scale.
In the next subsection we
illustrate this with a speciﬁc example.

In this kind of analysis, an important

feature,
stemming from multi-resonant proﬁles of mass spectra
and inﬂuencing the experimental search strategies, is the
following. Strong interference eﬀects between the BSM
resonances themselves and between the BSM and SM
states can give rise to a statistically signiﬁcant depletion
of events below the BW peak in the invariant mass
distribution, leading to the appearance of a pronounced
dip [141, 142]. It is possible to deﬁne the signiﬁcance of
the depletion of events in a manner similar to that for
the excess of events of the peak, which can be used to
extract model dependent exclusion and discovery limits
in the model’s parameter space. One can then present
such limits resulting from the analysis of the spectra
for either the peak or the dip. The xFitter framework
enables one to investigate whether the peak or the dip
analyses especially beneﬁt from the “improved PDFs”.

We next turn to the speciﬁc example of BSM W (cid:48)/Z (cid:48)
states in composite Higgs models, considering broad-
resonance searches in the leptonic channels.
For
sensitivity studies comparing leptonic with heavy-quark
channels in composite Higgs models see e.g. [143].

1. Enhancing the sensitivity of BSM searches with
improved PDFs

New gauge sectors in strongly-coupled models of
electroweak symmetry breaking [144] based on composite
Nambu-Goldstone Higgs [145, 146] feature multiple W (cid:48)
and Z (cid:48) broad resonances, and interference eﬀects of the
heavy bosons with each other and with SM gauge bosons.
An example is the 4-Dimensional Composite Higgs Model
(4DCHM) realization [147] of the minimal composite
Higgs model of Ref. [148]. The parameter space of the
model can be characterized in terms of two parameters,
the compositeness scale f and the coupling gρ of the new
resonances, with the resonances mass scale being of order
M
f gρ [144, 149]. Ref. [150] selects two 4DCHM
benchmarks, denoted by A and B, each characterized
by speciﬁc values of f , gρ and the resonance masses.
We next present an example of the results for exclusion
and discovery limits in the parameter space of these two
4DCHM benchmarks which can be obtained by using the
“improved PDFs” [142].

∼

In Fig. 12 [150] we show the limits from NC Drell-

13

Yan on the model parameter space, described in terms
of f and gρ, for the HL-LHC stage with center-of-mass
energy of 14 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 3000
fb−1.
In the background we give contour plots for the
masses of the new gauge bosons. The blue and red curves
are obtained respectively with the baseline CT18NNLO
PDF set [128] and with the proﬁled PDFs [142] using the
AFB and AW combination with 3000 fb−1 of integrated
luminosity. The top panel in Fig. 12 is for the peak
analysis, the bottom panel is for the dip analysis.
In
this setup, the peak of benchmark A would still be below
the experimental sensitivity, while the peak of benchmark
B, if the improved PDFs are employed, would be right
below the 2σ exclusion. When exploiting the depletion
of events in the dip below the peak, the sensitivity on the
model increases remarkably. Furthermore, as visible from
the bottom plot of Fig. 12, the improvement on the PDF
also has a very large impact particularly in the region
of small f and large gρ, where the sensitivity on the dip
can overtake the LHC reach in the peak region once the
proﬁled PDFs are employed. Taking into account the
reduction of PDF uncertainty, benchmark A would be
now at the edge of the 5σ discovery, while the sensitivity
on benchmark B would almost reach 3σ.

Tab. I [150] lists, in the case of the two benchmarks
A and B, the integration intervals in invariant mass for
the dip region as well as the resulting cross sections for
the SM background and the complete 4DCHM, together
with the associated PDF uncertainty using the baseline
CT18NNLO PDF set [128] and the proﬁled version [142]
using the AFB and AW combination with 3000 fb−1
of integrated luminosity.
It reports also the obtained
signiﬁcances for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb−1
employing the two PDF errors. The improvement in
signiﬁcance due to the proﬁled PDFs is sizeable, as
signiﬁcances grow by an amount from 40% to 90%
(i.e., by a factor of about 10 in comparison) for the
benchmarks A and B, respectively. A more modest
improvement in signiﬁcance is found [150] in the case
of the peak.

The above studies can be extended to CC Drell-Yan.
In fact, it is noted in [150] that, for cases in which both
neutral and charged new states appear and are correlated
by theory, the reduction of systematic PDF error can
proﬁtably be applied to combined W (cid:48) and Z (cid:48) searches.
For example, in the 4DCHM a direct W (cid:48) exclusion (or
indeed discovery) achieved in the CC channel can be used
indirectly to probe the existence of a Z (cid:48) better than this
can be done with direct searches in the NC channel. The
analysis of the dip often provides more stringent limits
than the signal coming from the peak, with the reduction
of systematic PDF errors playing a crucial part in this
conclusion.

of data or pseudodata at high mass scales in the
multi-TeV region.
In this case, assuming purely
SM predictions would lead to biased estimations on
new physics constraints:
see for instance the recent
studies [109, 151].

This bias can be avoided if the PDFs are extracted
simultaneously with the BSM parameters. Such non-
biased approaches are feasible with xFitter via interfaces
to BSM computations, for instance by using SM eﬀective
ﬁeld theory (SMEFT) expansions. For example, the
CIJET [152, 153] interface allows extending jet cross
sections with dimension-6 SMEFT operators for purely
left-handed, vector-like or axial vector-like color-singlet
exchanges. An xFitter analysis in this direction is
underway.

V. CONCLUSION

The xFitter program is a versatile, ﬂexible, modular,
and comprehensive tool that can facilitate analyses of the
experimental data and theoretical calculations.

It is a valuable framework for bench-marking and
understanding diﬀerences between PDF ﬁts, and it
can provide impact studies for possible future facilities
including HL-LHC, EIC, LHeC, DUNE, and UHE
Cosmic Ray experiments. We encourage use of xFitter,
and welcome new contributions from the community
to ensure xFitter continues to incorporate the latest
theoretical advances and precision experimental data.

Γ/M = 20% [150]. The short (long) dashed contours give the
BSM boson mass MZ2 (MZ3 (cid:39) MW2 ) in TeV.

2. Applications with SMEFT

In the discussion of the previous subsection, we study
the impact of “improved” PDFs on BSM physics at
the multi-TeV scale, while the improvement itself in
the PDFs comes from processes at the SM weak boson
mass scale. The asymmetry pseudodata employed in the
proﬁling [142] are centered around the SM vector boson
peaks and take into account only SM contributions. Since
we consider TeV scale BSM resonances, the new physics
contribution to the forward-backward asymmetry AF B at
the weak scale, which is due to the interference between
SM and BSM process, is small, and a similar conclusion
holds for the charged-current diﬀerential cross section
distribution.

On the other hand, a diﬀerent

scenario arises
