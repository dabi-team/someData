Abstract: This paper presents the software entitled “Partial Pole Placement via Delay Action,”
or “P3δ” for short. P3δ is a Python software with a friendly user interface for the design of
parametric stabilizing feedback laws with time-delays for dynamical systems. After recalling the
theoretical foundation of the so-called “Partial Pole Placement” methodology we propose as well
the main features of the current version of P3δ. We illustrate its use in feedback stabilization of
several control systems operating under time delays.

Keywords: Delay, stability, controller design, Python toolbox, GUI, online software.

1. INTRODUCTION

Time delays often occur in controlling dynamical systems,
mainly due to the time required for acquiring, propagating,
or processing information. It is commonly accepted that
a delay in a control loop induces instability, oscillations
and bad performance of the overall scheme. For instance,
since the 30s, Callender et al. (1936), Hartree et al. (1937)
showed the diﬃculty of handling delays in control loops
for second- and third-order linear time-invariant (LTI)
dynamical systems and one of the natural ideas was to
compensate it by pre-correction (see, e.g., Porter (1952)).

However, as noted and brieﬂy discussed in Sipahi et al.
(2011), in some cases, the delay can have a stabilizing
eﬀect. Furthermore, it has been emphasized in Suh and
Bien (1979) and Atay (1999) that one may replace the clas-
sical proportional-derivative controller by a proportional-
delayed controller, using the so-called “average derivative
action” due to the delay. Finally, regarding the beneﬁcial
eﬀect of the delay, closed-loop stability may be guaran-
teed for some dynamical systems subject to input delays
precisely by the existence of such delays, as pointed out
in Niculescu et al. (2010) and the references therein in
controlling oscillators by delayed output feedback.

The above reasons explain, in part, an abundant literature
on such topics, such as Gu et al. (2003); Michiels and
Niculescu (2014); St´ep´an (1989) and the references therein.
It should be mentioned that time-delay dynamical systems
are inﬁnite-dimensional systems and there exist several
ways to represent their dynamics. In the sequel, their
dynamics are represented by delay-diﬀerential equations

(DDEs). For an introduction on DDEs, we refer to Hale
and Verduyn Lunel (1993).

The software 1 P3δ was introduced in Boussaada et al.
(2020a, 2021). The main intention of the authors is to help
users interested in stability analysis and stabilization of
dynamical LTI systems in the presence of a single delay
in closed loop. P3δ makes use of the so-called multipli-
city-induced-dominancy (MID) and partial pole placement
methods. More precisely, MID is an unexpected spectral
property stating that, in some cases, the characteristic root
with maximal multiplicity deﬁnes the spectral abscissa of
the corresponding characteristic function, i.e., the right-
most root of the spectrum. In control, MID opened a new
and interesting perspective relying on the idea of a partial
pole placement by reinforcing the use of the delay as a
control parameter. For a deeper discussion on these meth-
ods, we refer to Amrane et al. (2018); Bedouhene et al.
(2020); Boussaada and Niculescu (2018); Boussaada et al.
(2020b, 2018b); Mazanti et al. (2021, 2020a,b); Boussaada
and Niculescu (2016a,b); Boussaada et al. (2016, 2018a);
Ma et al. (2022).

The software P3δ covers DDEs of retarded or neutral
type 2 with a single time delay, under the form

y(n)(t) + an−1y(n−1)(t) + · · · + a0y(t)

+ bmy(m)(t − τ ) + · · · + b0y(t − τ ) = 0,

(1)
under appropriate initial conditions, where τ > 0 is the
positive delay, y is the real-valued unknown function,
n and m are nonnegative integers with n ≥ m, and
a0, . . . , an−1, b0, . . . , bm are real coeﬃcients.

To address the stability analysis of LTI DDEs, the soft-
ware P3δ relies on spectral methods (see, e.g., Hale and

which consist on the study of the complex roots of a
characteristic function of the system. The characteristic
function ∆ : C → C of (1) is given by

and (1) is exponentially stable if and only if the spectral
abscissa γ = sup{Re s | ∆(s) = 0} satisﬁes γ < 0.

P3δ considers that b0, . . . , bm are free parameters. In its
“Generic” mode, a0, . . . , an−1 are also assumed to be
free and τ is ﬁxed while, in its “Control-oriented” mode,
a0, . . . , an−1 are assumed ﬁxed and τ can be assumed
either free or ﬁxed. The “Control-oriented” mode is usually
suitable for control applications, as illustrated in Section 3.

The strategy used by P3δ to stabilize a time-delay system
is to tune its free parameters to assign ﬁnitely many
roots while also guaranteeing that the rightmost root on
the complex plane is among the chosen ones. Two main
properties deﬁne such a strategy: (i) ﬁrst, assigning a real
root of maximal multiplicity and proving that this root is
necessarily the rightmost root of the characteristic quasi-
polynomial, a property which has been named multiplicity-
induced-dominancy, or MID for short, and (ii) second,
assigning a certain amount of real roots, typically equally
spaced for simplicity, and proving that the rightmost root
among them is also the rightmost root of the characteristic
quasipolynomial, a property which has been named coex-
isting real roots-induced-dominancy, or CRRID for short,
in Amrane et al. (2018); Bedouhene et al. (2020).

The MID property for (1) was shown, for instance, in
Boussaada et al. (2018b) in the case (n, m) = (2, 0), in
Boussaada et al. (2020b) in the case (n, m) = (2, 1) (see
also Boussaada and Niculescu (2018)), in Mazanti et al.
(2021) in the case of any positive integer n and m = n − 1
(see also Mazanti et al. (2020a)), and more recently in
Boussaada et al. (2022) for arbitrary n ≥ m. It was also
studied for neutral systems of orders 1 and 2 in Ma et al.
(2022); Benarab et al. (2020) and extended to complex
conjugate roots of maximal multiplicity in Mazanti et al.
(2020b). The CRRID property was shown, for instance,
in Amrane et al. (2018) in the cases (n, m) = (2, 0) and
(n, m) = (1, 0), and in Bedouhene et al. (2020) in the case
of any positive integer n and m = 0.

In all the above cases, the maximal multiplicity of a real
root or, equivalently, the maximal number of coexisting
simple real roots is n+m+1. The idea to exploit the nature
of (real or complex) open-loop roots in control design was
proposed for second-order systems in Boussaada et al.
(2020b) and extended for arbitrary order systems with
real-rooted plants in Balogh et al. (2020, 2022).

As mentioned earlier, P3δ allows for the parametric design
of stabilizing feedback laws with time-delays by exploiting
the MID and CRRID properties brieﬂy presented above.
The present paper describes the new functionalities of P3δ
and provides some illustrative examples for its use.

After a ﬁrst iteration of the software, P3δ Online was
completed with new features (Figure 1) that enrich the
software and improve user experience. The one-click online
version of P3δ is still hosted on Binder, which provides
a personalized computing environment directly from a
GitHub repository. The P3δ team continued to develop
the online software in Python, using the dynamic Jupyter
Notebook format and with an user interface built using
interactive widgets from Python’s ipywidgets module.
P3δ is freely available for download on https://cutt.ly/
p3delta, where installation instructions, video demonstra-
tions, and the user guide are also available. 3

P3δ Online is based on the program of the executable
version and enriched with exclusive features to this version.
The online software includes features from the “Generic
MID”, “Control-oriented MID”, and “Generic CRRID”
modes of P3δ described in Boussaada et al. (2021, 2020a).

In the “Generic MID” mode, the online version of the
software returns the spectrum distribution as well as
a normalized quasipolynomial which admits a root of
multiplicity n + m + 1 at the origin 4 . In the “Control-
oriented MID” mode, the online version of software returns
the admissibility region, a normalized quasipolynomial
which admits a root of multiplicity m+2 at the origin, and
an illustration of the bifurcation of the root of multiplicity
m + 2 with respect to variations of the delay τ .

The ﬁrst new feature of P3δ Online is the addition of a
“Home” tab that contains information about the project
and the software settings. Two settings are currently avail-
able: the appearance of notiﬁcations and the activation of
the software limits.

In the “Generic MID” mode, the spectral distribution
analysis now provides two new forms of the output equa-
tion, Factorized integral equation and Hypergeometric fac-
torization. In the “Control-oriented MID” mode, it is now
possible to choose the value of the discretization step as
well as the number of iterations for the τ sensitivity plot.

Finally, the P3δ team has developed a new feature to
export the results obtained in the software in the format of
a report automatically written in a PDF ﬁle. The user has
the choice of which calculation mode results they want to
export and can save the report directly on their computer.

2.2 Assignment admissibility region

Given a system, the deﬁnition of valid hyper-parameters
(s0 and τ ) can sometimes be diﬃcult. In order to help users
getting a better idea of the admissibility ranges of s0 and
τ , P3δ has an admissibility region plotting feature which
will be described in this section. Note that this feature is
only available when using “Control-oriented MID” as it
currently is the only mode with constraints on (s0, τ ).

3 Interested readers may also contact directly any of the authors of
the paper.
4 In this case, the multiplicity coincides with the degree of the quasi-
polynomial ∆, and represents the maximal allowable multiplicity.

More precisely, given a0, . . . , an−1, the admissibility region
is deﬁned as the set of pairs (s0, τ ) ∈ R × (0, +∞) for
which there exist real coeﬃcients b0, . . . , bm such that s0
is a root of ∆ of multiplicity at least m + 2 when the
delay is τ . To compute such a region, we ﬁrst express the
coeﬃcients (bi)0≤i≤m in terms of (ai)0≤i≤n−1, s0, and τ by
using the m + 1 equations ∆(k)(s0) = 0, k ∈ {0, . . . , m}.
As those equations are linear in the m + 1 variables
b0, . . . , bm, this linear system admits a unique solution. We
then replace these expressions of (bi)0≤i≤m in the equation
∆(m+1)(s0) = 0, obtaining an algebraic relation between
s0, τ , and the coeﬃcients (ai)0≤i≤n−1. By construction,
this is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for s0 to be
a root of multiplicity at least m + 2 of ∆ and, since
the coeﬃcients (ai)0≤i≤n−1 are known in this mode, this
algebraic equation characterizes the admissibility region.

In P3δ, the computations leading to this admissibility
region is done by following the previously mentioned steps
in a symbolic way using the sympy package. Only the part
of the admissibility region in the rectangle [s0,min, 0] ×
[0, τmax] is displayed, where s0,min < 0 and τmax > 0 are
values selected by the user.

3. APPLICATIONS OF P3δ

To illustrate P3δ, we present some applications of the
software.

3.1 Harmonic oscillator

Consider a controlled harmonic oscillator described by

y(cid:48)(cid:48)(t) + y(t) = u(t),
(3)
where y(t) ∈ R is the instantaneous state of the oscillator
available to measurement, the control input u(t) corre-
sponds to the applied force, and the coeﬃcients of the
equation were normalized. We assume that the control in-
put is given by a delayed proportional-derivative controller
u(t) = −βy(t − τ ) − αy(cid:48)(t − τ ),
(4)
where α and β are the coeﬃcients of the controller and
τ > 0 is the delay. The characteristic equation of the
closed-loop system is thus

∆(s) = s2 + 1 + (β + αs)e−sτ .
(5)
The polynomial corresponding to the non-delayed term
in (5) is of degree n = 2, while that corresponding to

the delayed term is of degree m = 1. The degree of the
quasipolynomial ∆ is thus n + m + 1 = 4.

Let us use P3δ in order to place a root of multiplicity
m + 2 = 3 at some s0 ∈ R. One should ﬁrst input into
P3δ the values of the known coeﬃcients of the quasipoly-
nomial ∆ from (5), i.e., the coeﬃcients of the polynomial
corresponding to the non-delayed term. After introducing
the data corresponding to (5) into P3δ, one obtains the
plot of the admissibility region, as in Figure 2.

Fig. 2. Data input and admissibility plot for the harmonic

oscillator.

Based on Figure 2, one observes that the method used by
P3δ allows for the stabilization of the system if the delay is
at most approximately 1.4. After inputting the value of the
delay, P3δ will compute the root s0 and the coeﬃcients α
and β, and trace the spectrum distribution of (5) with the

derived values. In the present example, the corresponding
screen of P3δ is shown in Figure 3, where, for τ = 1, one
obtains s0 = −1, α = 0, and β ≈ −0.7358.

Fig. 3. Computed values and spectrum distribution for the

harmonic oscillator.

3.2 Inverted pendulum

As a second example of application of P3δ, we consider
the stabilization of an inverted pendulum from Figure 4,
in which a stick of mass m and length (cid:96) is placed over a
cart and can rotate freely around the attachment point A.
The cart can move along a rail and an external force F is
applied on the cart, and we assume that the mass of the
cart is negligible compared to the mass of the stick. We
denote by ϕ the angle between the stick and the upward
vertical direction. In this case, following Molnar et al.
(2021), the linearization of the dynamics of ϕ around the
unstable equilibrium ϕ = 0 is

ϕ(cid:48)(cid:48)(t) − mg(cid:96)

2I ϕ(t) = (cid:96)

(6)
where I = 1
12 m(cid:96)2 is the moment of inertia of the stick
and g is the gravitational acceleration. For the numerical
application, we will consider m = 10 kg and (cid:96) = 10 m, in
which case I ≈ 83.33 kg m2.

We wish to stabilize the origin of (6) by a delayed PD
feedback of the angular position, i.e., we wish to apply

Note that, here, the delay τ can be seen as a design
parameter, together with Kp and Kd.

By introducing the data corresponding to (7) into P3δ
“Control-oriented MID” mode, we obtain the admissibility
plot from Figure 5. Based on this plot, we decide to assign a
root of multiplicity 3 of (7) at s0 = −5. P3δ then gives the
result shown in Figure 6. From the computed values of the
coeﬃcients shown in Figure 6, one deduces that the delay
corresponding to s0 = −5 is τ ≈ 0.112 and the coeﬃcients
of (7) should be Kp(cid:96)
2I ≈ 11.53 and Kd(cid:96)
2I ≈ 4.4898, yielding
the parameters Kp ≈ 192.16 and Kd ≈ 74.83.

3.3 Transonic ﬂow in a wind tunnel

Consider now a wind tunnel in which a cold ﬂuid is set to
motion at high speed. The control of the velocity of such a
ﬂuid around an equilibrium state can be described by the
system

(cid:26)

κm(cid:48)(t) + m(t) = kθ(t − τ0),

θ(cid:48)(cid:48)(t) + 2ζωθ(cid:48)(t) + ω2θ(t) = u(t),

(8)

where m denotes the deviation of the Mach number of
the ﬂuid with respect to its equilibrium state, κ and k

are constants depending on the characteristics of the ﬂuid
and the desired equilibrium state, θ is the angle of a
guide vane driving the velocity of the ﬂuid, τ0 > 0 is a
delay depending only on the temperature of the ﬂuid, ζ
and ω are parameters of the dynamics of the guide vane
angle, and u is a control input. The above model comes
from Armstrong and Tripp (1981) and its stabilization was
previously discussed in Mazanti et al. (2021) under the
assumption that one may choose ζ and ω. We consider
here a more realistic situation in which ζ and ω are ﬁxed,
and a feedback law of the form
u(t) = −βm(t − τ1) − α0θ(t − τ0 − τ1) − α1θ(cid:48)(t − τ0 − τ1),
where τ1 ≥ 0 is a new delay, which can be seen as a
design parameter and should be at least equal to the delay
for measuring m. For simplicity, we denote τ = τ0 +
τ1. Inserting this control
law into (8) and performing
straightforward algebraic manipulations, one deduces that
θ veriﬁes the third-order diﬀerential equation
(cid:1) θ(cid:48)(cid:48)(t) +

θ(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)(t) + (cid:0)2ζω + 1
+ α1θ(cid:48)(cid:48)(t − τ ) + (cid:0)α0 + α1
and hence the closed-loop characteristic quasipolynomial
∆ of (8) is

As a numerical application, we consider the linearization
around the steady state with Mach number 0.84 and
air temperature 166 K,
in which case, as reported in
Armstrong and Tripp (1981), the system parameters are
κ = 1.964 s, k = −0.67036 rad−1, τ0 = 0.33 s, ζ = 0.4368,
and ω = 3.292 rad s−1. We can hence insert the known
coeﬃcients of (9) into P3δ, as shown in Figure 7, and
obtain the admissibility plot from Figure 8.

applications. The main novelty of the version discussed
in the paper is the improvement of the graphic interface
for the online version of the software. Inspired by the
“Control-oriented MID” mode, the team is working on
a “Control-oriented CRRID” mode. In addition, an exe-
cutable version for macOS is currently under development.

Based on Figure 8, we choose in this example s0 =
−2.94675 as a root of multiplicity 5 of the quasipolynomial
∆, and P3δ provides the output shown in Figure 9. In
particular, we deduce the numerical value τ ≈ 0.4140 s,
yielding τ1 ≈ 0.0840 s, as well as γ2 ≈ 0.04167, γ1 ≈
−1.9005, and γ0 ≈ 1.9993, yielding β ≈ −2.9908, α0 ≈
1.9217, and α1 ≈ 0.04167.
