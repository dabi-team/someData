Abstract—Power  system  robustness  against  high  impact  low 
probability events is becoming a major concern. To depict distinct 
phases  of  a  system  response  during  these  disturbances,  an 
irregular  polygon  model  is  derived  from  the  conventional 
trapezoid  model  and  the  model  is  analytically  investigated  for 
transmission  system  performance,  based  on  which  resiliency 
metrics  are  developed  for  the  same.  Furthermore,  the  system 
resiliency to windstorm is evaluated on the IEEE reliability test 
system  (RTS)  by  performing  steady-state  and  dynamic  security 
assessment  incorporating  protection  modelling  and  corrective 
action  schemes  using 
for 
Engineering  (PSS®E)  software.  Based  on  the  results  of  steady-
state  and  dynamic  analysis,  modified  resiliency  metrics  are 
quantified. Finally, this paper quantifies the interdependency of 
operational  and  infrastructure  resiliency  as  they  cannot  be 
considered discrete characteristics of the system.

Based  on  a  study  conducted  in  [6],  among  different 
scenarios,  extreme  weather  events  have  been  constantly 
reported causing huge impacts on system operation. With the 
increasing trend of power system outages that are induced by 
extreme  weather  conditions,  enhancing  power  system 
resiliency  to  such  events  is  gaining  more  attention  in  the 
research  community.  Apart  from  the  reliability  metrics, 
numerous resiliency metrics have been developed recently to 
quantify the network robustness against windstorms as detailed 
in [7]. Diverse quantifications are considered in the literature 
such as analyzing system adaption and disruption [8]-[10], and 
network recovery both at operational and structural levels [11]. 
Resiliency  incorporates  long  and  short-term  planning  and 
adjustments during event progression and post-shock periods. 
Defensive  islanding,  effective  remedial  action  design,  and 
system  hardening  are  among  long-term  planning  measures, 
whereas  short-term  measures 
include  event  forecasting, 
accurate assessment of the availability of assets, as well as the 
implementation of effective preventive and corrective actions.  

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

An electric power system is a highly complex, nonlinear, 
and  non-convex  system  whose  uninterrupted  operation  is  of 
paramount importance for any modern society. Severe events 
can create disturbances in power systems that lead to operation 
interruptions and even major cascading outages and blackouts 
if proper preventive actions are not being considered to make 
the system robust against such events. The Texas outage due to 
a snowstorm which created a major impact on people’s life [1]-
[2] is an example of such outages. Such events are referred to 
as  high  impact  low  probability  events  which  include  natural 
disasters  and  man-made  disasters.    In  recent  years,  power 
system  resiliency  has been  a nascent subject attracting  many 
scholars [3]-[5] to understand its operational and infrastructural 
characteristics.  

to 

(e.g., 

Resiliency  evaluation  approaches,  such  as  triangle  and 
represent 
trapezoid  methods,  are  used  extensively 
infrastructural 
transmission  corridor  status)  and 
operational (e.g., load and generator shedding) performances in 
[12]  and  [15].  The  resiliency  trapezoid  model  incorporates 
ramping decrement in performance indictor during an event and 
modifies  the  resiliency  triangle  assertion  of  impulsive  drop 
during the shock absorption. Moreover, prior work considered 
a  linear  representation  of  resilience  indicators  as  the  event 
propagates  and  the  system  recovers.  All  these  prior analyses 
focus only on the steady-state response of the system. However, 
power  system  security  during  extreme  events  is  highly 
dependent on its dynamics and protection systems. Prior work 
fully  ignores  power  system  dynamics  and  protection  system 
behaviour while analyzing power system resiliency to extreme 
events.  In  order  to  bridge  the  gap  between  actual  system 
performance  and  estimated  system  performance,  i.e.,  using

steady-state analysis, this paper focuses on evaluating system 
responses  based  on  steady-state  and  dynamic  analysis  with 
protective relay modelling. The overall result obtained is coined 
as an aggregated result. The term ‘aggregated result’ is used to 
address  the  combined  results  of  steady-state  and  dynamic 
analysis in the upcoming sections. 

Based  on  the  fragility  model  for  the  transmission  assets 
extracted  from  [7],  the  impact  of  windstorms  on  system 
performance, both  in  the steady-state and  transient  period, is 
analyzed and new resilience metrics are proposed in this paper. 

The contributions of this paper include: 

(1)  Development of a new framework to evaluate power 
system resiliency by assessing the transient stability of 
the system after critical changes in the system assets 
during  extreme  weather  events  along  with 
the 
evaluation of the steady-state condition of the system. 
Moreover,  critical  protective  relays  are  included  in 
transient  stability  analysis.  This  contribution  is  of 
critical  importance  as  the  power  system  response 
during  extreme  events  is  usually  governed  by  the 
dynamic response of generators, control systems, and 
protection system behaviour.

II. 

QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF POWER SYSTEM 

RESILIENCY 

Power  system  resiliency 

is  usually  categorized  as 
infrastructure  and  operational  resiliency.  The  infrastructure 
performance  indicators  represent  power  system  component 
status  during  events.  The  operational  resiliency  indicators 
quantify various factors such as the percentage of load served, 
generation availability, and frequency deviation. The first part 
of  this  section  tends  to  briefly  discuss  the  infrastructure  and 
operational  resiliency  based  on  linear  models  such  as  the 
trapezoid  method  discussed  in  [7],  whereas  the  latter section 
proposes  an  irregular  polygon  model  for  measuring  system 
resiliency. This model is referred to as the aggregated model in 
this paper. 

A.  Infrastructure  and  Operational  Resiliency:  Trapezoid 

Model 

The  crucial  assets  of  the  electric  power  systems  involve 
generators,  transmission  lines,  transformers,  and  distribution 
lines.  Responses  of  these  devices  during  the  event  are 
monitored and are collectively referred to as the power system 

response.  During  any  event,  the  power  system  response 
framework  indicating  the  operational  and  infrastructural 
performance  with  respect  to  time  can  be  schematized  and 
depicted as shown in Figure 1. In general, the system response 
can be categorized into four phases, namely, intact, absorption 
and adaption, recuperation, and recovered operation (RO). The 
first  phase,  known  as  the  intact  phase,  is  a  pre-contingency 
state, where the system operation is undamaged or unaffected. 
The performance indicator at this stage is ideally 100% and the 
system  remains  in  an  undamaged  state  until 𝑡 = 𝑡0.  In  the 
absorption  and adaption  phase,  the system  resiliency  indictor 
decreases  during  event  progression  until  𝑡𝑒𝑒  and  the  system 
operates  in  a  new  state  immediately  after  the  event.  The 
operational  and  infrastructure  indicators  remain  at  the  post-
disturbance state until the time of 𝑡𝑠𝑟. 

Figure 1. Modified multiphase trapezoid curve 

In the third phase, restoration begins at 𝑡𝑠𝑟 , and the system 
tries to reach its pre-contingency state. Both the infrastructure 
and  operational  indicators  slowly  recover  until  𝑡𝑟.  The  final 
phase  or  the  recovered  operation  indicates  the  measure  of 
infrastructure  and  operational  indicators  during  the  post-
recovery  state.  Unlike  infrastructure  resiliency,  operational 
resiliency  recovery  is  influenced  by  demand,  generation 
availability, asset operational capability, and implementation of 
effective corrective actions. System resiliency during the post-
recovery  period  can 
improved/deteriorated 
indicate  an 
performance or the same pre-contingency performance of the 
system. 

B.  System Resiliency: Irregular Polygon Model

the 

Similar 

infrastructure/operational 

The  resiliency  measure  depends  on  asset  outages  and 
human  intervention  during  the  recovery  phase.  A  linearized 
irregular  polygon  model  [15]  is  defined  in  this  section  for 
defining the system resiliency indicator as shown in Figure 2. 
resiliency 
assessment  (IORA),  the  system  level  performance  has  four 
phases, namely, intact, absorption, recuperation, and recovered 
operation.  However, unlike  the  recuperation phase  in IORA, 
the recuperation phase in system-level performance has three 
states, namely, operational recovery, quasi recovered state, and 
recovery.  The 
infrastructure 
infrastructure  recuperation  phase  is  a  highly  laborious  and 
time-consuming phase defining the recovery rate of the system 
after  the  disruption  period.  However,  during  this  asset 

and  operational

repairing period, the system operators can regain a part of the 
lost  load  and  disconnected  generators  by  implementing 
corrective  operational  actions,  e.g.,  generator  re-dispatch, 
power  import  from  (export  to)  another  area;  this  stage  is 
defined  as  operational  recovery  in  this  paper.  Starting  from 
𝑡𝑜_𝑠𝑟,  this  state  prolongs  until  𝑡𝑞_𝑠𝑟.  During  the  next  state, 
known  as  the  quasi-recovered  state,  a  part  of  disconnected 
customers/generators  and  islanded  buses/areas  are  regained 
back  and  the  system  reaches  a  new  operational  state  with  a 
lower performance indicator compared to the targeted value. 
This state lasts until 𝑡𝑖𝑜_𝑠𝑟
. I&O recovery state, being the third 
state,  interprets  the  system  performance  improvement  by 
recovering the infrastructural and operational characteristics of 
(𝑠). Note that there can be multiple states of 
the network until 𝑡𝑟
operational  recovery  as  more  assets  are  repaired  and  new 
operational actions are implemented (Figure 1).

B.  Fragility Modelling of Transmission Network 

reliability  of 

Fragility analysis is a probabilistic approach to determine 
the 
(including 
transmission  lines  and  towers)  during  extreme  weather 
conditions and can be generally represented as (1).  

transmission  networks 

                    𝜗(𝑣𝑖) = {

0,              𝑖𝑓 𝑣 < 𝑣𝑐𝑟
𝜗(𝑣),    𝑖𝑓 𝑣𝑐𝑟 ≤ 𝑣 ≤ 𝑣𝑏𝑟 
1,             𝑖𝑓 𝑣 > 𝑣𝑏𝑟

                      (1) 

Where  𝜗(𝑣)  is  the  failure  probability  of  the  transmission 
network for any wind speed of 𝑣 m/s and 𝜗(𝑣𝑖) is the failure 
probability of the transmission network for the wind speed of 
𝑣𝑖 m/s when the wind speed is bounded within the critical wind 
speed (𝑣𝑐𝑟) and the breakdown wind speed (𝑣𝑏𝑟). For a wind 
speed  below  𝑣𝑐𝑟,  the  infrastructure  and  operation  of  the 
transmission  network  remain  unaffected  (i.e.,  zero  failure 
probability).  Whereas,  for  a  wind  speed  above  𝑣𝑐𝑟  the 
reliability of the transmission network is altered based on the 
failure probability function. Wind speed above 𝑣𝑏𝑟 collapses 
the  structural  and  operational  template  of  the  network  (i.e., 
100%  failure  probability).  Based  on  the  fragility  data,  the 
status  of  the  transmission  corridor  can  be  decided  using  a 
uniformly  distributed  random  number  (𝑅 ∈ (0,1).  The 
transmission network goes offline if the failure probability is 
greater than the generated random number (i.e., 𝜗(𝑣) > 𝑅 ). 
The transmission network recovery depends on the mean time 
to repair and the severity of the weather intensity.

schemes—including 

load  shedding,  and  undervoltage 

The approach that has been followed in this paper to define 
and evaluate the resiliency metrics is depicted in Figure 3. The 
process involves conducting steady-state and dynamic analysis 
of the system at each hour of event propagation to calculate the 
proposed metrics. Transient stability analysis with  modelling 
protection 
relays, 
load 
underfrequency 
shedding schemes—as well corrective actions are carried out 
at each hour of the event period. The transient stability studies 
evaluate system  dynamic  stability  and  identify  the  lines  that 
may be tripped (due to overload conditions or unstable power 
swings)  and  the  loads/generators  that  are  shed  during  the 
transient  period.  The  results  of  transient  stability  (including 
line tripping and generator/load shedding) are utilized to make 
the related updates in the steady-state system topology at every 
time  step.  A  steady-state  analysis  of  the  updated  system 
involving  AC  optimal  power  flow  (AC-OPF)  is  performed 
with minimization of the bus load adjustment (amount of shed 
load) as the objective function.

TEST SYSTEM AND RESULTS 

The  IEEE  reliability  test  system  is  used  for  testing  the 
proposed  framework  using  the  software  tool  PSS®E  version 
35.2.  In  this  section,  the  reliability  test  case  system,  system 
dynamic  and  fragility  model  are  briefly  discussed,  and  the 
steady-state and aggregated results are analyzed and compared 
as  well.  Besides,  the  importance  of  the  aggregated  result  is 
brought  to  notice  in  the  system  resiliency  study  considering 
stability as one of the key factors of discussion. 

A.  IEEE Reliability Test Case 1996 

The IEEE reliability 1996 test (RTS’96) system proposed in 
[14]  is  considered  for  analyzing  and  quantifying  resiliency 
metrics in this study. RTS is a three-area 73 bus system having 
a total of 99 conventional generators, 104 transmission lines, 16 
two-winding branches, and 51 load buses. The total generation 
capacity of the system is 14,550 MW and the peak load demand 
is  8725.26  MVA.  The  mean  time  to  repair  (MTTR)  for 
transmission lines is considered one-fifth of that of transmission 
towers. Following are the assumptions considered throughout 
the period of the simulation study.  

1) 

The resiliency study is carried out for a power system 
against a windstorm affecting only area 1. The event initiates 
at t = 51 and prolongs for a period of 25 hours. 

2) 

The simulation is carried out for 400 hours assuming 
the availability of the labour force after the windstorm event. 
The simulation hours can extend up to a period of 600 to 750 
hours based on the storm intensity level. 

3) 

The study is carried  out only  for  transmission level 
and the bus loads are modelled as lumped constant power load 
model.  The  corresponding  hourly  bus  loads  are  scheduled 
based  on  the  active  and  reactive  power  demand  during  the 
winter season on weekdays/weekends.  

4) 

The  fragility  model  of  the  transmission  networks  is 
designed  assuming  that  the  138  kV  and  230  kV  systems  as 
normal (less robust) and more robust corridors, respectively. 

this  recovery  might  take  an  even  longer  period  in  real-time 
scenarios.  During  event  progression,  the  long-term  thermal  
rating (24-hour rating) and short-term thermal rating (15-min 
rating)  for  the  branches  are  considered  for  steady-state  and 
dynamic analyses, respectively.  

The hourly load profile and wind speed variation during the 
event progression are depicted in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. 
The  fragility  model  representing  transmission  line/tower 
failure probability with respect to different wind speeds for less 
robust  and  more  robust  systems  is  extracted  from  [7]  and  is 
shown in Figure 6.

The  GENROU  model  from  the  PSS®E  software  model

transient stability studies.

GENROU represents a round rotor generator model and its 
corresponding exciter model used is EXST1 (1992 IEEE ST1 
model). The constant power bus loads are modelled using the 
PSS®E  model  IEEEBL1.  HYGOV,  GGOV1,  and  TGOV 
models have been employed for the machine governor models. 
Undervoltage/frequency  load  shedding  (UVFLS)  relays  are 
developed using PSS®E user-defined model UVUFBLU1 and 
are  included  in  the  studies.  DISTR1  model  from  the  PSS®E 
software model library is used to model distance relays (mho 
relay). Parameters for load shedding relay and distance relay 
models are selected based on the NERC rules and regulations 
[13]  and  are  tabulated  in  Table  II  respectively.  The  breaker 
delays for UVLS and UFLS models are 0.05 and 0.02 seconds, 
respectively. 

C.  Steady-State Results 

AC  optimal  power  flow  module  of  PSS®E  is  used  for 
steady-state  analysis  with  the  aim  of  minimizing  the  load 
shedding  at  each  bus.  The  steady-state  infrastructural  and 
operational  resiliency  indicators  based  on  the  availability  of 
generators, served bus loads, and connected transmission lines 
are plotted in Figures 7, 8, and 9, respectively. 

There are 99 generation units in the test case, and during the 
event progression, a total of 15 units become offline because of 
bus  islanding  due  to  line  outages,  decreasing  the  available 
generation capacity from 14,550 MW to 13530 MW at the end 
of the event. As a result of the isolation of load buses due to the 
windstorm effect, approximately 4% of the load is shed.  

Figure 7. Hourly generator units and active power capacity availability 

Figure 8. Percentage of load connected 

In  Figure  9,  there  are  two  curves  representing  the 
operational statuses of the transmission lines (solid line) and the 
infrastructure  availability  of  the  transmission  lines  (dashed 
line). The dashed line  represents  the  number  of  transmission 
lines that were not damaged by the windstorm whereas the solid 
line represents the operational status of all transmission lines. A 

transmission branch becomes operationally unavailable due to 
bus  islanding  or  complete  damage  because  of  the  event. 
However, the line is infrastructurally available if not damaged 
by the event. The recovery time for the towers and lines that are 
damaged depends on their mean time to repair rates obtained 
from the IEEE RTS data.

The curves in Figure 9 match the irregular polygon model 
discussed  in  section  II.A.  The  resiliency  metrics  provided  in 
Section III. A for the generation units, loads, and transmission 
corridors are calculated and are provided in Table III. In Table 
III, IR and OR refer to infrastructure resiliency and operational 
resiliency, respectively.

D.  Aggregate Results 

Aggregated  results  include  the  steady-state  and  dynamic 
analysis results. Transient stability analysis based on rotor angle 
stability  is  carried  out  for  a  time  period  of  15  seconds.  The 
branch  rating  is  set  to  STE  (15-min  emergency  rating).  The 
branch status is updated (disturbance is introduced)  1 second 
after the study initiation time. The step size for the simulation 
is 0.0083 s (which is half of the 60 Hz cycle period). Dynamic 
performance of the system in terms of transient load shedding 
and  generator  shedding  around  the  corresponding  simulation 
hour is plotted in Figures 10, and 11, respectively. 

Both  the  generator  and  load  curves  have  dips  at  certain 
hours during the simulation. These dips in the curves are due to 
the  transient  generator  and  load  shedding  which  can  be 
recovered  after  a  period  of  20  minutes  based  on  the  above 
assumption. Figures 10 and 11 represent the aggregated results 
and  reveal  the  actual  number  of  generators  and  loads  that 
become offline during the event. It is observed that a load drop 
of  83.6  %  occurs  at  simulation  hour  of  237  because  of 
reconnecting generator bus 122. These dips in the generator and 
load curves (generator/load shedding) are not observed in the 
steady-state  analysis.  Thus,  the  steady-state  analysis  alone  is

not  sufficient  for  having  a  realistic assessment  of  the system 
resiliency since the system stability and the dynamic response 
of  the  system  are  important  to  monitor.  The  following 
paragraphs  brief  the  importance  of  dynamic  analysis  after  a 
major disturbance by providing an instance where  an  intense 
outage happened causing system instability during the study. 

Due  to  this  tripping  action,  the  machines  at  bus  122  lose 
synchronism and this action of losing synchronism is observed 
at generators connected to buses 114, 115, 116, and 123 in area 
I. Because of unstable power swings at generator buses 325 and 
223, the two tie branches 325-121 and 318-223 are tripped by 
distance  relay  operation  causing  line  overloading.  It  is  also 
further observed that almost all machines located in area II and 
area III lost their synchronism at this hour.  

The  relative  rotor  angles of  the  generators at  hour  52  are 
shown in Figure 12. Actions such as generators tripping at bus 
122 by out of step relay can prevent the system instability in 
this case. This action makes the system stable and prevented 
distance relay misoperation and the consequent tripping of the 
tie  lines.  The  relative  rotor  angles  of  the  generators  after 
applying the corrective actions are shown in Figure 13.  As can 
be seen in this figure, no generator loses its synchronism with 
respect to the rest of the system.

During transient stability studies, the stability of the system 
is evaluated by  monitoring  the  relative  rotor angles,  voltages 
and  bus  frequency  of  the  connected  machines.  One  such 
instance during the simulated event that can jeopardize system 
stability occurred at hour 52. If proper corrective actions were 
not  taken  within  the  effective  time,  the  tripping  of  the  line 
between Arnold 230 kV and Aston 230 kV buses at hour 52 can 
jeopardize system stability. Due to the storm effect at hour 52, 
the transmission line between buses 114 and 117 is damaged. 

The  generator  sheddings  with  and  without  corrective 
actions at hour 52 are compared in Figure 14. As can be seen, 
with  corrective  actions  being  implemented  at  hour  52,  the 
percentage  of  the  generators  remaining  online  increased 
substantially. Similarly, the load shedding can be compared for 
the mentioned cases. At hour 52, the load shedding has reduced 
from  94.5%  to  8.1%  by  implementing  the corrective  actions, 
which shows that the remedial actions prevent the system from 
collapsing and losing all its load. The system resiliency metrics 
based on the aggregated results of the system are computed and 
tabulated  in  Table  IV.  In  Table  IV,  IR  and  OR  refer  to

Comparing the disruption, recovery rate, and area under the 
curve metrics of the aggregate results, it is observed that their 
values are less than that in the steady-state studies since steady-
state  studies  do  not  consider  system  instability,  transient 
load/generator shedding, and line tripping. The existing steady 
state (trapezoid) resiliency model is not sufficient for analysing 
system resiliency as it neglects dynamic stability, transient load 
shedding  and  transmission  line  tripping.  These  issues  are 
addressed in dynamic studies and specific corrective actions are 
implemented  to  make  the system  operate  in  stable condition. 
Besides, the multiple stages of recovery can be visualized in the 
irregular polygon model, which cannot be shown in the current 
trapezoid model.

CONCLUSION 

This paper analyzes the steady-state and dynamic effects of 
windstorms  on  power  systems. The studies are  conducted  on 
the  IEEE  reliability  test  system  1996.  An  irregular  polygon 
model  has  been  developed  based  on  the  extension  of  the 
conventional  multiphase  trapezoid  model.  The  system-level 
resiliency model is introduced and is quantified based on the 
resiliency  metrics  including  disruption  rate,  recovery  rate, 
recovery time, absorption time, and area under curve metrics. 
The system-level recovery rate formulation has been modified 
based on the existing trapezoid model considering the effect of 
quasi  recovery  state  on  the  model.  Disruption  rate,  recovery 
rate, and area under curve metrics are modified and proposed 
based on the aggregate results obtained from the  steady-state 
and  transient  stability  results.  Moreover,  the  importance  of 
including transient stability analysis in power system resiliency 
studies  and  its effects  on  evaluating  the  system’s  operational 
status  such  as  load  shedding  and  generation  shedding  is 
evaluated in this paper. The rotor angle stability of the system 
is  evaluated  throughout  the  event  period,  and  the  impact  of 
implementing  proper  corrective  actions  on  preventing  rotor 
angle instability and improving the resiliency metrics of power 
systems is analyzed. Finally, the resiliency metrics for steady-
state and aggregate results are computed and compared. It can 
be observed that the area under the curve, disruption rate, and 
recovery  rate  metrics  are  highly  impacted  in  the  dynamic 
analysis due to the presence of dips in load and generator status 
curves.  In  addition  to  the  existing  steady-state  analysis,  the
