ABSTRACT:  

Microstrip patch antennas are low-profile and robust when mounted on rigid surfaces of 

the devices making them suitable for communication and millimeter-wave applications. In 

this paper, an antenna is designed for the resonant frequency of 170 GHz using microstrip 

technology concerning its miniaturization and cost-effectiveness. The designed antenna is a 

part  of  a  stray  radiation  detection  system  for  ECE  diagnostic  to  be  installed  on  fusion 

research machine ITER. It offers low-directivity to receive radiation from all directions, high 

bandwidth, low side-lobe-level and return loss of -50 dB, leading to its remarkable utilization 

in the detection system being designed to protect millimeter wave components of ITER ECE 

Diagnostic. Power-handling and power-capturing capability of the designed  antenna have 

also  been  discussed  in  the  paper.  Far-field  simulations  have  been  performed  using  CST 

Microwave Studio software to study the radiation characteristics of the designed antenna.

INTRODUCTION 

Microstrip antennas have various advantages over other conventional antenna techniques due 

to their simple configuration. They are low-profile (i.e. small height and width), compatible with 

MMIC  designs,  quite  simple  and  cheap  to  manufacture  via  printed-circuit  technology  and 

mechanically  robust  when  placed  on  rigid  surfaces  [1].  Furthermore,  they  also  offer  some 

additional  properties  such  as  feedline  flexibility,  dual-polarization,  frequency  agility  and 

omnidirectional  patterning  [2,3].  The  importance  and  feasibility  of  microstrip  antenna  in  our 

practical world can also be noted by wireless 5G communications and high-performance satellite, 

medical and missiles applications [4-6]. In this paper, our main goal is to design a compact antenna 

1 

 
 
 
having wide angle reception. We opted the conventional microstrip technology for the designing 

purpose as the importance and feasibility of microstrip antenna in our practical world has been 

proved effectively. However, the designed antenna is based on the conventional Microstrip Patch 

Antenna design, but its operating frequency stands out the design from the previous work. As we 

know with an increment in the operating frequency, the dynamics of electrons inside the patch also 

changes drastically and that can change the whole characteristics of a system. This paper aims to 

design a reliable antenna array at 170 GHz for stray radiation sensor being designed for ITER ECE 

Diagnostic  and  possesses  characteristics  like  low  directivity,  high  bandwidth  and  better  power 

handling capability that has not been explored till now by any other research group. 

The  Electron  Cyclotron  Emission  (ECE)  diagnostic  system  on  ITER  will  provide  plasma 

electron temperature profile and electron temperature fluctuations with high spatial and temporal 

resolution [7-10]. Some challenges need to be addressed to ensure its proper functioning, such as 

protection  from  RF  stray  radiation,  obligatory  to  prevent  damage  to  ECE  components  [11-13]. 

These stray radiations are generated due to Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) wave 

frequency of 170 GHz utilized for plasma heating and current drive inside the vacuum vessel [14-

16]. After multiple–reflections inside the vacuum vessel, the unabsorbed ECRH power becomes 

diffused and depolarized and may enter the ECE Diagnostic system through port openings. It is 

proposed  to  use  a  sniffer  –  a  real-time  power  monitoring  system-  to  be  followed  by  a  shutter 

safeguarding the ECE diagnostics. The crucial part of the proposed sniffer is the receiving system 

that will sense all the power expected to be entering through the port and incident on the ECE 

components.  In  this  paper,  an  antenna  system  is  designed  to  collect  the  stray  electromagnetic 

energy from the vacuum vessel window and convert it into electrical energy to be monitored by 

the detector system. 

Section  II  describes  the  analytical  expressions  and  selection  criteria  for  the  characteristic 

design parameters of the microstrip antenna. These formulas will provide a good estimate of the 

antenna dimensions intended for millimeter wavelength. The final design of an antenna array is 

described  in  Section  III.  Comparative  calculations  for  the  power  handling  capacity  of  the 

individual and array antenna are presented in Section IV. In Section V, simulation results of the 

antenna are discussed.   Our conclusions are reported in Section VI, highlighting the importance 

of the designed antenna and scope of future work.

II.  DESIGN PARAMETERS FOR ANTENNA 

The microstrip patch antenna is a single-layer design consisting of four main parts: (i) Patch; 

(ii)  Substrate;  (iii)  ground  plane;  (iv)  feeding  part.  Interestingly,  one  can  design  microstrip 

antennas for specific resonant frequency, impedance and radiation patterns merely by modifying 

their dimensions. This feature makes it the best fit for our required application. However, each of 

these components need to be designed carefully as discussed below: 

Patch Dimensions 

A patch can be of any shape, but the rectangular shape is usually preferred due to its easy 

fabrication  and  simple  analyses,  avoiding  complex  numerical  computations.  Considering  𝜆0 =

1.76𝑚𝑚 as the free-space incident wavelength, the patch length (𝐿𝑝) and its thickness (𝑡) should 

be in the range 

𝜆0
3

< 𝐿𝑝 <

𝜆0
2

 and 𝑡 ≪ 𝜆0, respectively, for better antenna performance.  

Substrate Selection 

In patch antenna design, the substrate is primarily required to offer mechanical support and 

spacing between the ground plane and patch. The dielectric constant of the substrate material can 

alter the electrical performance of the antenna and impedance of transmission line. Therefore, it 

should be chosen in the range 12 > 𝜀 > 2.2. For efficient radiation generation, low 𝜀 material is 

preferred  as  it  enhances  the  fringe  fields  that  account  for  the  radiation.  Furthermore,  several 

quantities must be parameterized for a specific design, such as loss tangent, temperature effects, 

surface wave excitation, dielectric dispersion, weight, elasticity and cost. Substrates with a higher 

thickness (ℎ) and a high dielectric constant result in smaller bandwidths and lower efficiencies 

due to the possibility of surface-wave excitation. Hence, it is convenient to keep the height of the 

substrate in the range of 0.01𝜆0 ≤ ℎ ≤ 0.05𝜆0 for the significant elimination of multiple surface 

waves. To overcome some of the problems of thin antenna elements (such as low power handling 

capability)  without  unduly  sacrificing  their  principal  advantages,  they  can  be  built  on  thick 

substrates. In this paper, Rogers RO3003 having dielectric constant 3.0, loss factor 𝑡𝑎𝑛𝛿 = 0.001 

(on 10GHz) and ℎ = 0.254𝑚𝑚 is chosen as the substrate material to meet our requirements. The 

patch  material  used  in  CST  MWS  Studio  is  Copper.  The  considered  Rogers  RO3003  high 

3 

 
 
frequency  laminates  are  ceramic-filled  PTFE  composites  for  use  in  printed  circuit  boards  in 

commercial microwave and RF applications. Its operating frequency range is 30-190GHz. 

Boundary Condition 

As we are interested in measuring the radiated power, all the results for antenna parameters 

are  evaluated  in  the  far-field  region  determined  by  the  inner  boundary  distance  𝑠 ≥

2𝐷2
𝜆0

 𝑤here, 𝐷 = 0.6239 𝑚𝑚  is  the  largest  antenna  dimension.  It  gives  the  far-field  distance  as 

~ 0.44 𝑚𝑚, which is exactly the distance used in  simulation. 

Analytical Expressions 

For  the  analysis  of  the  microstrip  antenna,  the  transmission  line  method  is  used  for  better 

physical understanding. In this method, the antenna structure is treated as two slots separated by a 

transmission line. For clarity, the rectangular patch parameters are represented in Fig. 1. 

Figure 1: Dimensioning sketch for inset fed patch antenna. 

Furthermore, the following parameters need to be fixed first while designing an antenna system: 

I.  The dielectric constant of the substrate (𝜀 ) 

II.  Resonant frequency (𝑓 ) 

III.  Height of the substrate (ℎ) 

4 

 
 
Once  these  parameters  are  fixed,  the  practical  width  and  length  of  the  patch  𝑊𝑝  and  𝐿𝑝  are 

determined by using the following expressions: 

𝑊𝑝 =

𝑣0

√

𝜀  + 1

𝐿𝑝 =

2𝑓 √𝜀𝑒𝑓𝑓√𝜇0𝜀0

− 2∆𝐿𝑝  

(1) 

(2) 

where ∆𝐿𝑝 is the extended length, originated due to fringing effect (i.e., the field lines at the edges 

of patch undergo fringing) and having dependence on the resonant frequency, as 

∆𝐿𝑝
ℎ

= 0.412

(𝜀𝑒𝑓𝑓 + 0.3) (

𝑊𝑝
ℎ

(𝜀𝑒𝑓𝑓 − 0.258) (

(3) 

and, 𝜀𝑒𝑓𝑓 is the effective dielectric constant, which accounts for fringing and wave propagation in 

the feedline defined as 

 𝜀𝑒𝑓𝑓 =

𝜀  + 1

𝜀  − 1

(4) 

 Most of the fringing field lines reside in the substrate such that 𝜀𝑒𝑓𝑓 ≈ 𝜀 . The length and width of 

the  ground  plane  is  determined  by  using  the  relation  𝐿𝑔 = 6ℎ + 𝐿𝑝  and  𝑊𝑔 = 6ℎ + 𝑊𝑝, 

respectively. 

Microstrip Feedline Dimension 

While designing an antenna, it is necessary to carefully configure the feeding lines in order 

to prevent impedance mismatching. In other words, antenna parameters need to be optimized by 

selecting the proper feeding technique and their feed location. The microstrip-line feed technique 

offers better reliability, ease of fabrication and good polarization purity over other techniques such 

as coaxial, aperture-coupled, proximity-coupled feed etc. It is etched on the same substrate as that 

of the patch, providing a planar structure. The width of this microstrip feedline (𝑊𝑓 ) is related to 

its characteristic impedance such that

   and  𝐺 = 0.6 + 0.009𝑍0.  𝑍0  is  the  static  (i.e.  low-frequency) 

characteristic impedance. The phase velocity of quasi TEM-mode propagating in microstrip gets 

modified as 𝑣𝑝 =

𝑐
√𝜀𝑒(𝑓) 

 and so does the wavelength 𝜆𝑝 =

𝑣𝑝
𝑓

.  

For our antenna design, inset-fed microstrip feed is opted, which has advantages of overcoming 

narrow-bandwidth constraints and capturing more signals with improved accuracy.  In the inset 

feeding technique, it is preferred to have the feeding location at a certain distance 𝑥0 from the edge 

of the patch towards the center, in order to overcome resonant input resistance. The feeding point 

can be calculated using the relation 

 𝑅𝑖𝑛(𝑥 = 𝑥0) =

III.  ANTENNA ARRAY DESIGN 

The main characteristics required for our system are wide-angle reception and better power 

handling capability. Conventional methods used for large apertures are bulky and complicate the 

design  unnecessarily.  Antenna  array  technology  entails  𝑁  number  of  small-aperture  identical 

antenna  elements,  exclusively  positioned  according  to  their  functionality.  Therefore,  the  array 

provides a large aperture, which makes it proficient to detect extremely weak signals from distant 

sources with improved gain and radiation pattern compared to a single antenna patch, as shown in 

Fig.  2.  The  antenna  array  also  offers  better  power  handling  capabilities  than  a  single  antenna 

element that will be discussed in the next section. The feeding location of an antenna array is a 

crucial part that controls the distribution of voltages among the elements [17]. It is also responsible 

for proper power distribution among antenna elements due to its steering ability leading to beam 

phase change [18-20].

resonant frequency where 𝑡 depicts the thickness of the conducting patch. 

Depending on the required specifications, one can define various array configurations, such as 

high bandwidth, high gain and improved efficiency. We designed a 2 × 2 patch antenna array for 

the resonant frequency of 170 GHz, whose dimensions are optimized using Eqs. (1) − (6). Figure 

2(b) shows an antenna array displaying measurements of the patch and feeding network etched on 

the RO3003 substrate with dimensions 3.55 × 3.0 × 0.254 𝑚𝑚3 . The substrate thickness is kept 

small to get higher bandwidth. A symmetric corporate feeding network is used to feed different 

patches  of  the  antenna  array  with  50 𝑜ℎ𝑚  microstrip  lines  of  width  0.063𝑚𝑚.  T-  junction 

technique  is  adapted  for  uniform  power  distribution  and  compact  designing  as  it  reduces  the 

number of power dividers. The distance between two patches should always lie between 𝜆0/2 to 

𝜆0 enabling maximum scanning range and is optimized as 1.6 𝑚𝑚 in this case. The quarter-wave 

transformer is used to match impedance between the feeding line and the patch to reduce reflection 

losses,  which  shall  be  discussed  later.  Moreover,  the  excitation  of  the  system  is  done  by  a 

waveguide port.  

IV.  POWER CALCULATION 

Power Capturing 

The maximum effective aperture of an antenna is defined as 𝐴𝑒𝑚 =

2
𝜆0 
4𝜋

𝐺0𝑟 where, 𝐺0𝑟 is the 

receiving  antenna  gain.  Using  the  Friis-Transmission  equation,  the  power  collected  by  the 

receiving antenna is calculated using the following expression 

𝑃𝑟
𝑃𝑡

=

𝐴𝑒𝑚𝐺0𝑡
4𝜋𝑅2 = (

𝜆0
4𝜋𝑅

)

2

𝐺0𝑟𝐺0𝑡 

(7) 

where 𝑃𝑡 is the input power of the source and 𝑅 is the distance between source and antenna. For 

isotropic sources, 𝐺0𝑡 = 1. And (

2

𝜆0
4𝜋𝑅

)

 is a free-space loss factor that considers the losses due to 

the spherical  spreading  of the energy by the antenna.  Equation (7)  relates the power collection 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
capability of an antenna directly to its gain. As we have mentioned earlier, the wide aperture of an 

antenna  array  endorses  higher  gain  and  hence,  higher  power  collection  than  a  single  antenna 

element. 

Average Power Handling  

The  rise  in  temperature,  (i.e.,  the  difference  between  the  maximum  operating  temperature  for 

substrate (𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥) and ambient temperature (𝑇𝑎𝑚𝑏))  may determine the average power handling 

capability (APHC) of a system as

analytical one. In Section III later, it will be seen that the APHC value for the antenna array is 

0.76𝑘𝑊 , which manifests the viability of the antenna array over the individual patch antenna. 

V.  RESULTS 

Impedance matching always ensures the maximum power transfer between the source and the 

load.  Hence,  a  noble  matching  circuit  is  required  for  a  specific  design  ensuring  its  better 

performance. The corporate feed network can use either a quarter-wave transformer or a stub to 

match patch element impedance to standard 50-ohm input impedance. The preferences mentioned 

above for our design  are configured in Fig. 3. The important properties of the designed system 

with  both  configurations  are  simulated  using  CST  Microwave  Studio  software  and  examined 

below to check their reliability.

A.  S-Parameter and VSWR 

The amount of power reflected from the antenna is parametrized by 𝑆11 parameter and Voltage 

Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) related to each other by the following relation 

 𝑆11 = 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠(𝑑𝐵) = −20 log10 (

𝑉𝑆𝑊𝑅 − 1

) 

(12)

The antenna bandwidth can also be measured from the VSWR plot over a range of frequencies 

where  its  value  is  ≤ 2.  The  variation  of  𝑆11  over  the  range  of  frequencies  for  quarter-wave 

transformer and stub configuration is plotted in Fig. 4. At the resonant frequency, i.e., 170 GHz , 

the  minimum  value  of  𝑆11  is  −50 𝑑𝐵  for  quarter-wave  and  −35 𝑑𝐵  for  stub  configuration.  It 

articulates the impedance matching along the propagation path of the signal and effective power 

delivery for quarter-wave transformer configuration.

transformer and (b) stub configuration. 

B.  Side Lobe Level and Beamwidth 

The performance of an antenna is usually measured in terms of gain and its relative 3D radiation 

pattern. The radiation pattern is represented by polar plots as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), measured 

in  the  far-field  antenna  range  as  mentioned  earlier.  It  suggests  that  the  main  lobe  direction  is 

different  for  both  the  quarter-wave  transformer  and  the  stub  configuration  for  the  resonant 

frequency 170 GHz, which is 260 and 70, respectively.  However, they possess approximately the 

same magnitude of gain depicted in Fig. 5(c) and (d). Gain IEEE measured in both configurations 

does not include the losses associated with the polarization and impedance mismatching.

Figure  5:  Far  field  characteristics  of  antenna  array  for  two  configurations  (i)  quarter-wave 

transformer (a, c); and (ii) stub (b, d). 

Far-field  characteristics  also  enable us to  investigate two  important  parameters  associated  with 

antenna performance. One is Half-Power beamwidth (also known as angular width), defined as the 

angular separation of 3dB in the radiation pattern. It deals with the resolution capabilities of the 

system. And another is the Side-lobe level (SLL), measured by the ratio of the amplitude of the 

main lobe to that of the side lobe. Low SLL minimizes the false target indication through the side 

lobes. There is a trade-off between both parameters and one needs to be compromised over the 

other [21]. We designed a system with a wider reception angle in lieu of high SLL to meet our 

requirements.  

The major difference in  both  the configuration, i.e., stub  and quarter-wave transformer, can be 

noted in Fig. 5. In the case of stub configuration, the value of angular width and SLL parameter 

12 

 
 
     
                                
 
are 31.50 and −3.6𝑑𝐵, respectively. However, for quarter-wave transformer these are 70.50 and 

−15.5𝑑𝐵. It is evident from here that the parameters such as bandwidth, gain, S-parameter and 

side-lobe  level  attain  desirable  values  for  antenna  array  with  quarter-wave  transformer  as  a 

matching circuit. In other words, the quarter-wave transformer dominates over the stub in terms of 

better impedance matching, which makes it suitable for our desired application.  

C.  Efficiency  

The  power  supplied  to  the  system  generally  dispenses  into  surface-wave  excitation,  radiation 

emission and conductor and dielectric dissipation. Radiation efficiency is defined as the ratio of 

power radiated to the power inserted into the antenna system which is plotted in Fig. 6 for the 

2 × 2 antenna array. It also encompasses the total efficiency of the system that takes into account 

all  𝐼2𝑅 losses  and  the  reflections  arise  due  to  mismatching  between  the  antenna  and  the 

transmission line.  

Figure 6: Variation of efficiency of antenna array with the frequency. 

For better understanding, we summarized the above-discussed properties of the individual 

patch antenna and the antenna array (with two different matching circuit configurations) in tabular 

form in Table 2. Here, we conclude the superiority of the 2×2 antenna array with a quarter-wave 

13 

 
 
 
transformer over other systems in terms of return loss, bandwidth, efficiency, angular width and 

SLL.

VI.  CONCLUSION 

A 2 × 2 microstrip antenna array has been designed and simulated successfully for the resonant 

frequency of 170 GHz using CST Microwave Studio software. The dominance of the antenna array 

over the individual patch has been proved while investigating their properties and power handling 

capabilities.  However,  continuous  increment  in  the  number  of  patches  of  an  antenna  array 

enhances  its  directivity  further  and  decreases  its  angular  width.  Hence,  the   2 × 2 antenna 

geometry  reasonably  satisfies  our  desired  requirements.  Significant  properties  of  the  designed 

system  such  as  S-parameter,  VSWR,  gain,  beamwidth,  side-lobe  level,  efficiency  have  been 

estimated and discussed.  A comparative study of the two matching circuits, i.e., stub and quarter-

wave transformer, have also been performed. The designed system's power-handling capability is 

also evaluated to check its reliability. At resonant frequency 170 GHz, the return loss is -50 dB, 

angular width is 70.50 and the gain is 8.6dBi for the designed antenna. The simulation results show 

14 

 
 
 
that the designed system fulfills required characteristics and is recommended for high-frequency 

detector applications.  

The future work is to design a detector system for application in ECE diagnostic components 

protection, utilizing this designed antenna.
