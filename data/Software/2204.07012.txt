ABSTRACT
We present the gMOSS (Galaxies of Medium-band One-meter Schmidt telescope Survey) catalog of ‚àº 19,000 galaxies in 20
Ô¨Ålters (4 broadband SDSS and 16 medium-band Ô¨Ålters). We observed 2.386 deg2 on the central part of the HS47.5-22 Ô¨Åeld
with the 1-m Schmidt telescope of the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory. The gMOSS is a complete Ô¨Çux-limited sample of
galaxies with a threshold magnitude of ùëü SDSS ‚â§ 22.5 AB. From photometric measurements with 16 medium-band Ô¨Ålters and ùë¢
SDSS, we get spectral energy distributions for each object in the Ô¨Åeld, which are used for further analysis. Galaxy classiÔ¨Åcation
and photometric redshift estimation based on spectral template matching with zebra software. The obtained redshift accuracy is
ùúéNMAD < 0.0043. Using the SED-Ô¨Åtting cigale code, we obtained the main properties of the stellar population of galaxies, such
as rest-frame (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res colour, stellar mass, extinction, and mass-weighted age with a precision of 0.16 ¬± 0.07 mag, 0.14 ¬± 0.04
dex, 0.27 ¬± 0.1 mag, and 0.08 ¬± 0.04 dex, respectively. Using a dust-corrected colour-mass diagram, we divided the full sample
into populations of red and blue galaxies and considered the dependencies between stellar mass and age. Throughout cosmic
time, red sequence galaxies remain older and more massive than blue cloud galaxies. The star formation history of a complete
subsample of galaxies selected in the redshift range 0.05 ‚â§ ùëß ‚â§ 0.015 with <logùëÄ> [M(cid:12) ]>8.3 shows an increase in the SFRD up
to ùëß ‚àº 3, under the results obtained in earlier studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

The evolution and physical properties of galaxies require statistical
studies with numerous objects. Using spectroscopic redshifts is most
preferable for analyzing the evolution of the physical properties of
galaxies with the redshift. Spectroscopic redshifts were widely used
in research on relatively bright galaxies with small redshift (e.g. in
Peng et al., 2010). However, for samples of tens and hundreds of
thousands of galaxies with high redshifts, fainter than ùêºAB = 22.0
mag and without strong emission lines, this is practically impossible.
Spectroscopy of such faint galaxies requires the largest telescopes
and exposure times of several hours (Le F√®vre et al. 2005; Gerke
et al. 2005; Meneux et al. 2006; Cooper et al. 2006; Coil et al. 2007;
Lilly et al. 2007).

There are several medium-band surveys of suÔ¨Écient depth that al-
low us to solve statistical problems of studying the physical properties
of galaxies: COMBO-17 (Classifying Objects by Medium-Band Ob-
servations, a spectrophotometric 17-Ô¨Ålter survey, Wolf et al. 2004),
ALHAMBRA (Advanced Large, Homogeneous Area Medium Band
Redshift Astronomical Survey, Moles et al. 2008), COSMOS (Cos-
mic Evolution Survey, Murayama et al. 2007), miniJPASS (a set of
J-PAS-like data for studies the scientiÔ¨Åc capabilities of J-PAS (The

vey Ben√≠tez et al. 2009; Benitez et al. 2014), Gonz√°lez Delgado et al.,
2021). Some of these surveys were performed on small-sized areas
that are signiÔ¨Åcantly spaced apart, which makes it diÔ¨Écult to study
the physical properties of galaxies depending on the density of the
environment (e.g. COMBO-17, ALHAMBRA). Broadband surveys,
because of the low accuracy of determining photometric redshifts
and spectral type classiÔ¨Åcation of galaxies, are excluded from con-
sideration. Spectral surveys of suÔ¨Écient area, such as SDSS (Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, Peng et al. 2010) and 2dFGRS (The 2dF Galaxy
Redshift Survey, Colless et al. 2003), are limited in-depth, while
deep spectral surveys are insuÔ¨Écient in the area and samples are not
complete due to the need for preliminary selection of objects. These
are the reasons photometric surveys using medium-band Ô¨Ålters are
becoming increasingly relevant.

In 2013 ‚Äì 2015 the Laboratory of spectroscopy and photometry
of extragalactic objects of the Special Astrophysical Observatory
together with Armenian specialists upgraded the 1-m Schmidt tele-
scope of the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory of the National
Academy of Sciences of Armenia (Dodonov et al. 2017). We com-
pletely redesigned the control system of the telescope: we replaced
the actuating mechanisms, developed telescope control software, and
made the guiding system. We redesigned and prepared a 4k x 4k
Apogee (USA) liquid-cooled CCD with RON ‚àº 11.1 e‚àí, a pixel size

of 0.868, and a Ô¨Åeld of view of about 1 deg2, and in October 2015
mounted it in the telescope‚Äôs focus. The detector is equipped with a
turret bearing 20 medium-band Ô¨Ålters (FWHM = 250 √Ö) uniformly
covering the 4000 ‚Äî 9000 √Ö√Ö wavelength range, Ô¨Åve broadband
Ô¨Ålters (ùë¢, ùëî, ùëü, ùëñ, ùëß SDSS), and three narrowband Ô¨Ålters (5000 √Ö,
6560 √Ö and 6760 √Ö, FWHM = 100 √Ö). The main programs of the
telescope are the search for young stellar objects, the evolution of
AGN, the stellar composition of galaxy disks, and the study of the
evolution of the main characteristics of galaxies.

The progress in the modern physics of galaxies, associated with
the growth of the number of observational data and the development
of numerical modeling methods, has not yet completely clariÔ¨Åed the
issues of the formation and evolution of galaxies. They remain open
and relevant. The variety of shapes and types of galaxies shows they
evolve under the inÔ¨Çuence of a signiÔ¨Åcant number of conditions: the
density of the environment, the rate of accretion of external matter,
internal secular evolution, the active nuclei feedback, etc. Each of
these conditions aÔ¨Äects the rate of star formation in the galaxy, which
leaves an "imprint" on the history of star formation (SFH).

This work presents two parts of the gMOSS (Galaxies of Medium-
band One-meter Schmidt Survey) photometric catalogue of 19,875
galaxies in a Ô¨Åxed aperture and 19,029 in Kron-like apertures, high-
precision photometric redshifts from 1-m Schmidt telescope of Byu-
rakan Astrophysical Observatory and spectral observation on the
6-meter BTA telescope of SAO RAS. Section 2 brieÔ¨Çy describes the
data and observations. Photometry, redshift estimation, and obser-
vational properties of the sample are given in Section 3. Section 4
comprises cluster galaxies catalogues descriptions. Estimating the
physical parameters of galaxies and brief analysis of galaxy stellar
populations are described in Section 5. And we discuss our results
in Section 6

The paper uses the cold dark matter cosmological ŒõCDM model
with parameters Œ©ùëÄ = 0.315, Œ©Œõ = 0.685 and H0 = 67.4 km s‚àí1
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2018). All the stellar masses in this
work are quoted in solar mass units (M(cid:12)) and are scaled according
to a universal Chabrier (2003) initial stellar mass function. All the
magnitudes are in the AB system (Oke & Gunn 1983).

2 DATA AND OBSERVATIONS

In this work, we use the observational data of HS47.5-22 Ô¨Åeld (Ham-
burg Quasar Survey, Molthagen et al. 1997) obtained by the 1-meter
Schmidt telescope (Dodonov et al. 2017) of the NAS RA Byurakan
Astrophysical Observatory during several sets in February, March,
April, and November 2017 and February and November 2018 years.
The telescope Ô¨Åeld of view with 4k √ó 4k CCD is 58√ó58 arcmin, with
a scale of 0.868 arcsec pixel‚àí1. Observations were made in 4 broad-
band Ô¨Ålters (ùë¢, ùëî, ùëü, ùëñ SDSS) and 16 medium-band Ô¨Ålters (FWHM =
250 √Ö with homogeneous coverage of the spectral range 4000 ‚Äì
8000 √Ö√Ö). Medium-band with ùë¢ SDSS Ô¨Ålters are presented in Fig.
1.

Four sets of exposures covered the central part of the Ô¨Åeld in
broadband and medium-band Ô¨Ålters. The overlap of adjacent sets
was about 10 arcmin. The total exposure time was selected to reach
a depth of ùëöAB ‚âà 25 mag with a signal-to-noise ratio of ‚àº 5 in
broadband (‚àº 2 h) and ùëöAB ‚âà 23 mag with a signal-to-noise ratio of
‚àº 5 in medium-band Ô¨Ålters (about 60 min at the peak of the detector
sensitivity curve and about 2 h at the edges of the range). From these
observations, we create a mosaic of 4 x 1 deg2 Ô¨Åelds with a total area
of 2.386 deg2.

In addition, we carried out long-slit spectral observations of certain

struction. The leftmost passband corresponds to ùë¢ SDSS Ô¨Ålter and the others

galaxies with the Russian 6-m telescope with SCORPIO-2 multi-
mode reducer of the telescope prime focus (Afanasiev & Moiseev
2011). The observations took place on 25, 28 of February 2020 (under
the seeing 2.1 and 3.0 arcsec respectively) and 13, 14 of December
2020 (under the seeing 1.5 and 1.3 arcsec respectively). The slit width
was 2 arcsec. We used the diÔ¨Äraction grating VPHG940@600, which
covers the spectral range 3500 ‚Äì 8500 √Ö√Ö and has a dispersion of
1.16 √Ö pixel‚àí1. The spectral resolution is ‚àº 7.0 √Ö (R ‚àº 5200)
estimated as FWHM for 1 arcsec slit of night-sky emission lines. The
total exposure time was selected to get a signal-to-noise ratio of ‚àº 5
‚Äì 10.

We processed the spectra of all objects that hit the slit and had
a suÔ¨Écient signal-to-noise ratio. We got the spectra of 29 galaxies.
We used a standard processing software package for spectra ob-
tained by multi-mode focal reducer SCORPIO-2. The data reduction
steps include bias subtraction, cosmic particle removing, Ô¨Çat-Ô¨Åeld
correction, wavelength calibration, sky subtraction, correction for
the atmospheric and spectrograph transparency by spectrophotomet-
ric standards, and extraction to 1D spectrum. The accuracy of the
spectral redshift estimation for all galaxies is 0.002.

All data is available to the reviewer(s) and will be made open-

source on publication.

Also, we use spectral and photometric data from the SDSS
database (Sloan Digital Sky Surveys, Data Release 16, Ahumada
et al. (2020)) for calibration of photometric redshifts and GAIA DR2
Gaia Collaboration et al. (2016, 2018) to exclude objects with proper
motions (like stars).

3 OBSERVATION DATA ANALYSIS

This section presents a summary of the observation data analysis
methods used in the gMOSS survey.

Figure 2. SED for 4 galaxies from HS47.5-22 Ô¨Åeld. The horizontal bar is the
Ô¨Ålter bandwidth, and the solid line is the spectra of these objects from the
SDSS survey. Flux diÔ¨Äerences seen in the picture are because of the limited
size of the Ô¨Åbers (3 arcsec) used for spectroscopy. The main spectral features
(e.g. H+K Ca ii, Mg, H ùõº, [O ii] and [O iii] - dashed lines) of each object are
also clearly visible in the SEDs.

3.1 Photometry

Photometry of the objects was obtained using sextractor (Bertin
& Arnouts 1996) in dual image mode. The base image was created
from the sum of deep (‚àº 25 mag) images obtained in ùëî, ùëü and ùëñ SDSS
Ô¨Ålters. Before the photometry, all images were convolved to common
seeing quality and transformed to a common coordinate system. For
galaxy type classiÔ¨Åcation and redshift estimation, we use photometry
in Ô¨Åxed apertures MAG_APER and correct received Ô¨Çuxes for light
loss using a light curve obtained from bright stars. The diameter of
the aperture was 3 arcsec. Using a Ô¨Åxed aperture allows us to reduce
the number of objects with strongly biased aperture photometry by
neighboring sources. For galaxy physical parameter estimation we
received Kron-like Ô¨Çuxes for 97 per cent galaxies of the total sample
in the Ô¨Åeld by using MAG_AUTO sextractor photometry because
of large photometric errors for some faint sources. Photometric cali-
bration was developed using spectral and photometric data from the
SDSS survey for the objects detected in the Ô¨Åeld. By using Ô¨Åeld ob-
jects as standard stars within each exposure, we were independent of
photometric conditions during imaging.

The galaxy sample of the HS47.5-22 Ô¨Åeld is limited by the thresh-
old magnitude ùëöAB = 22.5 mag in the ùëü SDSS Ô¨Ålter with redshift
ùëß ‚â§ 0.8. The total number of Ô¨Åeld objects down to ùëöAB ‚àº 25 mag is
approximately 85,000; the sample of galaxies intended for the study
included 18,079 galaxies with photometric data in a Ô¨Åxed aperture
and 17,545 galaxies with the use of Kron-like apertures applicable
to the selection criteria (see Section 3.3).

Photometric measurements from 17 Ô¨Ålters provide low-resolution
spectra for each object which are analyzed by a statistical technique
for classiÔ¨Åcation and redshift estimation based on spectral template
matching. SEDs for 4 galaxies from HS47.5 - 22 Ô¨Åeld in 16 medium-
band Ô¨Ålters and their SDSS spectra are shown in Fig.2. The main
spectral features such as H+K Ca ii, Mg, H ùõº, [O ii], [O iii] and
others are clearly visible in the SEDs. The photometric properties of
a galaxy sample of the HS 47.5-22 Ô¨Åeld were studied in the range
from 4000 √Ö to 8000 √Ö, which makes it possible to determine the
redshifts of galaxies up to ùëß = 0.8.

Figure 3. Comparison of the photometric redshifts ùëßph of the galaxies ob-
tained with the zebra software tool with the spectroscopic redshifts ùëßsp of the
galaxies taken from SDSS for 414 galaxies with spectroscopy. The accuracy
of determining the photometric redshift is ùúéNMAD < 0.0043, the outlier‚Äôs
percentage is Œîùëß/(1 + ùëß) > 5. ‚àó ùúéNMAD ‚àº 7.7 per cent. Accuracy ùúéNMAD
changes from 0.002 for objects brighter than 19 mag in ùëü SDSS Ô¨Ålter and
0.006 for objects brighter than 21 mag till 0.007 for objects brighter than
22.5 mag. The dashed line denotes a line of equal photometric and spectral
redshifts.

3.2 Photometric redshifts

The method for determining the photometric redshift and SED type
of galaxies is based on the correspondence of the spectral templates of
the galaxy to the observed energy distribution. We used the galaxy‚Äôs
spectral templates library from Dodonov & Chilingarian (2008), and
a set of programs zebra (Zurich‚Äôs Extragalactic Bayesian Redshift
Analyzer, Feldmann et al. 2006).

The obtained redshift accuracy is ùúéNMAD < 0.0043 and the frac-
tion of catastrophic outliers is (Œîùëß/(1 + ùëß) > 5. ¬∑ ùúéNMAD) ‚àº 7.7 per
cent. Figure 3 shows a comparison of the photometric redshifts of
galaxies obtained using the zebra software tool and the spectroscopic
redshifts from the SDSS database. The total number of galaxies with
spectroscopic redshifts in the observed HS47.5-22 Ô¨Åeld is 414. Ac-
curacy ùúéNMAD changes from 0.002 for objects brighter than 19.0
mag in ùëü SDSS Ô¨Ålter and 0.006 for objects brighter than 21.0 mag
till 0.007 for objects brighter than 22.5 mag.

3.3 Galaxy sample

A sample of galaxies for the study was made from a complete pho-
tometric survey (approximately 85,000 objects down to ùëöAB ‚àº 25
mag) according to the following criteria:

(i) To exclude objects with proper motions, such as stars, we used
data from the GAIA DR2 survey (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016,
2018);

(ii) To exclude stars (without proper motions in the GAIA survey),
we remove objects for which the morphological classiÔ¨Åcation from
the DECALS survey (Dey et al. 2019) is STAR;

Grokhovskaya A., Dodonov S. N., Movsessian T.A., Kotov S.S.

(iii) To exclude objects with strongly biased aperture photome-
try by neighboring sources or by many bad pixels in any aperture
we include to the sample only objects with the automatic index of
contamination of sextractor, as provided by the FLAGS‚â§ 2;

(iv) To deÔ¨Åne a Ô¨Çux-limited sample, we imposed the condition

that the galaxies have to be brighter than ùëüAB = 22.5 mag;

Applying this set of criteria to the initial sample of over 85,000
objects, we got a sample of galaxies, selected according to ùëü SDSS
magnitude, extended and contamination index. Our Ô¨Ånal sample of
objects with aperture photometry contains 19,875 extended and non-
contaminated sources with ùëüAB ‚â§ 22.5. For Kron-like photometry,
we obtain 19,029 objects because of large photometric errors for
some faint sources. MAG_AUTO provides the total Ô¨Çux of the source
within an elliptical aperture determined by the KRON_RADIUS,
MAG_APER measure for a smaller Ô¨Åxed aperture (3 arcsec).

It should be noted that the Ô¨Ånal gMOSS survey contains galaxies
with a wide variety of spectrum types, colours, and environments
(see Fig. 2 and Grokhovskaya et.al., 2022, in prep.). The SEDs of
galaxies on upper panels of Fig. 2 shows the power of gMOSS to
identify red galaxies, to detect the absorption lines such as H+K Ca
ii and Mg. Blue and star-forming galaxies with the recombination
nebular lines H ùõº and the other nebular collisional lines, such as
[O ii] ùúÜ3727 and [O iii] ùúÜ5007 are also very well-identiÔ¨Åed in the
survey (see the bottom panel in Fig. 2). Galaxies in groups, as well
as galaxies in less dense environments, are well identiÔ¨Åed because
we use a Ô¨Åxed 3 arcsec aperture to identify objects. It allows us to
analyze the dependence of the physical properties of galaxies on the
density of environments in the next work.

The completeness of the sample of galaxies number-counts in
ùëî, ùëü and ùëñ ùëÜùê∑ùëÜùëÜ Ô¨Ålters was veriÔ¨Åed by comparison with previously
published data in the papers Yasuda et al. (2001); Capak et al. (2004);
Kashikawa et al. (2004). Results are shown in Fig. 4. The galaxy
sample is complete up to ùëöAB = 23.0 mag with no colour selection
eÔ¨Äects in the all-optical range.

3.4 Observational properties of the sample

Figure 5 compares the distributions of redshift, magnitude, and error
in the ùëü SDSS band of the full sample of gMOSS galaxies and the
Ô¨Ånal selected sample of galaxies up to ùëß = 0.8. As seen from the
top-right panel of Fig. 5, the redshift sampling limit excludes most
of the galaxies with signiÔ¨Åcant errors in determining the magnitude
in the ùëü SDSS Ô¨Ålter, as well as some of the faint objects in the
sample. After the redshift ùëß = 0.3, we observe a sharp increase in the
number of objects associated with a rapid increase in the observed
volume. After the redshift ùëß = 0.6, there is a decrease in the number
of objects because of the selected threshold on the magnitude of
ùëüAB ‚â§ 22.5. Most of the galaxies in the sample have a photometric
redshift between 0.2 and 0.6.

Figure 6 shows the correlation between the magnitude of objects
in the ùëü SDSS Ô¨Ålter and photometry errors, both in the ùëü SDSS Ô¨Ålter
and for the average error in the medium-band Ô¨Ålters. For photometry
in Kron-like apertures, we obtained a strong increase in the average
error in the medium-band Ô¨Ålters for faint objects. This is because faint
objects (ùëü SDSS ‚àº 20.5 mag) in the part of the medium-band Ô¨Ålters
have an insuÔ¨Écient signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ‚â§ 5) for the correct
operation of the photometry algorithm with Kron-like apertures.
The bottom left panel shows galaxies with a Kron-like aperture,
which are used to get the properties of stellar populations of galaxies
using the SED-Ô¨Åtting code cigale (Burgarella et al. 2005; Noll et al.
2009; Boquien et al. 2019). The conditions for using the data in the

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì16 (2021)

Kron-like apertures were that the median error of the photometry
was less than 1 mag and at least half of the Ô¨Ålters were with a
suÔ¨Écient signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ‚â• 5) for detecting an object by
the Kron-like aperture detection algorithm. Thus, we could use Kron-
like photometry data for 9620 galaxies from a complete sample. For
the rest of the galaxies, we used aperture photometry data. This is
true for estimating distant faint objects whose dimensions do not
exceed 3 arcsec.

The magnitude in the ùëü SDSS band shows a dependence on redshift
Fig. 7. Galaxies with ùëü SDSS ‚â§ 20.0 mag (Ô¨Åxed aperture photometry)
are often at ùëß < 0.5, while fainter galaxies are at any distance. The
S/N ratio is also a clear function of the brightness of the galaxy, as
indicated by the magnitude in the ùëü SDSS Ô¨Ålter and median S/N ratio
in the medium-band Ô¨Ålters. The increase in the S/N for Kron-like
aperture photometry regarding Ô¨Åxed aperture photometry is clear
in Fig. 7, although this increase is quite signiÔ¨Åcant. For instance,
galaxies with ùëü SDSS ‚àº 21.0 mag have an S/N ‚àº 10 for Ô¨Åxed
aperture apertures, while for Kron-like apertures this value is ‚àº 3.
Therefore, for galaxies with an insuÔ¨Écient signal-to-noise ratio for
Kron-like photometry (S/N ‚â§ 5, typically these are galaxies fainter
than 20.5 mag in ùëü SDSS Ô¨Ålter), we use Ô¨Åxed-aperture photometry
data for analysis of galaxy physical properties.

We can Ô¨Åt ‚àº 74 per cent of the full gMOSS galaxy survey (in a
combination of aperture photometry and Kron-like photometry data)
with the cigale (Burgarella et al. 2005; Noll et al. 2009; Boquien
et al. 2019) SED-Ô¨Åtting code with an acceptable parameter value
of reduced ùúí2 (see Section 5). The unÔ¨Åtted spectra do not fulÔ¨Åll
quality requirements imposed by the SED-Ô¨Åtting codes, such as the
minimum S/N in each band. We select the total exposure time to get
a signal-to-noise ratio of ‚àº 5 ‚àí 10 for objects brighter than ùëü SDSS
= 22.5, however, for some faint objects this time may not achieve the
required S/N ratio.

4 CATALOGUE DESCRIPTION

We prepare two catalogues that were used for the analysis of stellar
populations and photometric redshifts of galaxies: photometry of
galaxies in Ô¨Åxed apertures (aperture size 3 arcsec) and Kron-like
apertures as two parts of gMOSS galaxy catalogue. Both catalogues
have the same structure as shown in Table 1. The columns of the
table contain the following information about the catalogue: (1) -
parameter name, (2) - unit of the parameter (3) - description of the
parameter. The magnitudes are in the AB magnitude system and are
not corrected for Galactic extinction.

Catalogues include unique object IDs, R.A. and Dec. coordinates
(J2000), photometric measurements in 16 medium-band and 4 broad-
band SDSS Ô¨Ålters, and their errors for each object and the accurate
photometric redshifts (ùúéNMAD < 0.0043 for all types of galaxies in
full magnitude range) obtained from Ô¨Åxed aperture photometry data
with spectral template matching by using a set of programs zebra
(Feldmann et al. 2006). The unique object ID is a combination of
the Ô¨Åeld number in the mosaic and the unique object number in each
Ô¨Åeld (NB: the numbers of objects in diÔ¨Äerent Ô¨Åelds may overlap, so
we additionally use the Ô¨Åeld identiÔ¨Åer). In addition, we included data
on spectroscopic redshifts from the SDSS survey for those galaxies
for which this was possible (Ahumada et al. 2020) and data on spec-
troscopic redshifts of 29 galaxies obtained with a 6-meter Russian
telescope. The catalogues contain galaxies brighter than 22.5 mag in
ùëü SDSS Ô¨Ålter.

The total number of galaxies in the catalogue with photometric
data in a Ô¨Åxed aperture is 18,079 galaxies, with the use of Kron-

Kron-like apertures is slightly less than the number of objects in the
catalogue with a Ô¨Åxed aperture because this method does not separate
close objects well.

In a separate table, we publish the physical properties of galaxies
such as age of the main stellar population, star formation rate (SFR),
luminosity, gas mass, stellar mass, and Ô¨Åtting quality parameter re-
duced ùúí2 obtained by using the SED-Ô¨Åtting code cigale (Burgarella
et al. 2005; Noll et al. 2009; Boquien et al. 2019) with cross-ID of
galaxies in photometry catalogues. The names of the parameters and
units of measurement are presented in Table 2.

In addition, in a separate table, we publish galaxies with spectral
redshifts which were obtained with the Russian 6-meter telescope
BTA and SCORPIO-2 multi-mode focus reducer. The columns of
the table contain the following information about observations: (1) -

unique galaxy id, (2), (3) - coordinates RA and DEC in degrees, (4)
- spectroscopic redshift, (5) - exposition of observation.

All data is available to the reviewer(s) and will be made open-

5 STELLAR POPULATIONS PROPERTIES OF GALAXIES

IN THE SAMPLE

This section describes the distributions of the stellar population
properties obtained with cigale SED-Ô¨Åtting code for the Kron-like
MAG_AUTO photometry of gMOSS catalogue.

To analyze the physical properties of stellar populations of galax-
ies, we used only objects up to ùëß ‚àº 0.8, since most of the extended
objects at ùëß ‚â• 0.8 are fainter than 22.5 mag and are barely detected,
and we do not have a suÔ¨Écient number of objects for statistical anal-

Figure 8 shows nearby galaxies (up to ùëß = 0.1) in the magnitude range
from 18.0 to 21.0 mag in the ùëü SDSS Ô¨Ålter. The main spectral fea-
tures of early (e.g. H+K Ca ii, Mg) and late-type galaxies (e.g. H ùõº,
[O ii] and [O iii]) are also well reproduced. SED-Ô¨Åtting uncertain-
ties increase towards the fainter magnitudes because of the higher
uncertainties in the data, which also increases for fainter objects.

The spectral energy distributions from the gMOSS catalogues are
well reproduced by the SED-Ô¨Åtting code cigale. The quality of the
correspondence for the entire sample of galaxies can be estimated
using the reduced ùúí2-parameter. The dependence of the ùúí2
pa-
rameter on the signal-to-noise ratio is shown in Figure 9, the colour
bar corresponds to the redshift for each object. The discretization
of the signal-to-noise ratio distribution for bright galaxies is due to
the limitation of photometry accuracy. As expected, there is some
inverse dependence for the chi-squared parameter value on the signal-

5.1 SED-Ô¨Åtting code parameters

There are many modern codes for SED-Ô¨Åtting spectra in the full
spectrum range from X-rays to radio such as prospect (Robotham
et al. 2020), beagle (Chevallard & Charlot 2016), bagpipes (Car-
nall et al. 2018), cigale (Burgarella et al. 2005; Noll et al. 2009;
Boquien et al. 2019), prospector (Leja et al. 2017; Johnson et al.
2020), magphys (da Cunha et al. 2008), baysed (Han & Han 2012,
2014, 2019) and others. The stellar mass, rest-frame colours, ages,
and other physical parameters in this work are derived using the
cigale code. cigale (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) is a
multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) Ô¨Åtting code for
extragalactic studies. The code has been developed to study the evo-
lution of galaxies by comparing modeled galaxy SEDs to observed
ones from the far X-rays to the radio.

Through template Ô¨Åtting, a series of stellar population parameters
can be obtained, such as the rest-frame (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res colour, the mass-
weighted age, V-band attenuation ùê¥v, total stellar mass, age of the
main stellar population in the galaxy, metallicity, and star formation
rate. Modeling the stellar component of galaxies is done by the default
BC03 (Bruzual & Charlot 2003) spectral evolution synthesis models
with the Chabrier (2003) initial mass function. We considered a
set of six discrete metallicities: 0.0001, 0.0004, 0.004, 0.008, 0.02,
0.05. A delayed SFH with optional exponential burst and thirteen
diÔ¨Äerent values of star formation timescale ranging from 1 to 12 Gyr
is assumed. The modiÔ¨Åed Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation law is
used with a ratio of total to selective extinction for the extinction
curve applied to emission lines ùëüV = 3.1 (the average value for the
Milky Way). Dust emission model (Draine et al. 2014), nebular and
rest-frame parameters modules are also used.

5.2 Fitting and quality assessment

and ùë¢ SDSS Ô¨Ålters of various types of galaxies in gMOSS sample

We can Ô¨Åt 12,281 galaxies of the 16,509 objects from the full
sample (‚àº 74 per cent) with the cigale SED-Ô¨Åtting code. This number

5.3 Distributions of stellar populations properties

Fig. 10 shows distributions of selected physical properties of Ô¨Åtted
galaxies. The purple gradient lines show the quality of SED-Ô¨Åtting
(reduced ùúí2-parameter). The colour (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res shows the bimodal
distribution of galaxies, where the maximum density is at (ùë¢ ‚àíùëü)res ‚àº
1.5 mag for blue galaxies and (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res ‚àº 2.5 mag for the red
sequence. The bimodal distribution becomes more clear for objects
with a decrease in the value of the ùúí2
parameter. The mass-
weighted age distribution <log age>M [yr] has two peaks on ‚àº 9.0
and ‚àº 9.6 dex.

reduced

The extinction ùê¥V for the sample of galaxies is distributed in
the range from 0 to 1.4 mag, which is slightly less than the ranges
obtained in other works (for example, in the Gonz√°lez Delgado et al.
2021, the extinction is in the range from 0 to 2.0 mag). This is
because of the choice of the observation Ô¨Åeld, which is in an area
with a very low density of neutral hydrogen on the visual beam

<ùëÅH> = 1020 cm‚àí2, which is not much higher than the absorption
value in the "Lockman Hole" region (Lockman et al. 1986), where
the lowest absorption on the visual beam is observed for the northern
sky <ùëÅH> = 4.5 ¬∑ 1019 cm‚àí2.

The stellar mass distribution ranges from ‚àº 7 to ‚àº 11.5 dex. The
age of the main stellar population distribution <log age> [yr] has two
peaks on ‚àº 9.4 and ‚àº 9.9 dex. Metallicity is distributed discretely due
to the initial conditions for calculating models.

5.4 Mass‚Äìcolour diagram

To study the diÔ¨Äerences between the red and blue populations of
galaxies, it is customary to use mass-colour diagrams (D√≠az-Garc√≠a
et al. 2019; Schawinski et al. 2014; Moresco et al. 2013). The rest-
frame colour (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res shows that the galaxies are quite clearly
divided into these two populations. Fig. 11 shows the mass-colour
diagrams in combination with the parameters of the mass-weighted
age, metallicity, and extinction. The mass-colour diagram with the
mass-weighted age parameter (Fig. 11, left) shows the apparent sep-
aration of galaxies into younger blue galaxies with log(age)M [yr]
down to ‚àº 9.4 dex and older red ones with log(age)M [yr] above
‚àº 9.5 dex. Most galaxies have solar metallicity, however, super-solar
values are often found for red sequence galaxies and low-metallicity
values for blue galaxies. The extinction value practically does not
depend on which population of galaxies it is determined for. How-
ever, ùê¥V > 1.0 mag is typical for galaxies with (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res ‚àº 1.5 mag,
which roughly corresponds to the galaxies from the green valley. This
is consistent with the assumption that the green valley galaxies are
star-forming galaxies from the blue cloud (D√≠az-Garc√≠a et al. 2019;
Gonz√°lez Delgado et al. 2021).

5.5 The accuracy of determining the properties of the stellar

populations

Uncertainties in determining the physical properties of galaxies were
obtained within the SED-Ô¨Åtting process by the cigale code. Figure
13 shows the distribution of the accuracy of the physical properties
of galaxies in the colour-mass diagram. The parameter of the age
of the main stellar population of the galaxy has the best precision
of estimation: ùúé(log(age)L) = 0.05 ¬± 0.04 dex. Estimates of the
accuracy of total stellar mass, the mass‚Äìweighted age and the rest-
frame (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res colour, are fairly well obtained: ùúé(log(ùëÄ) [ùëÄ(cid:12) ] ) =
0.12 ¬± 0.05 dex, ùúé(log(age)M) = 0.10 ¬± 0.04 dex and ùúé(ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res =
0.19 ¬± 0.08 mag. The stellar extinction precision is ùúé( ùê¥V) = 0.28 ¬±
0.09 mag. The accuracy depends on the signal-to-noise ratio and
resolution in SEDs. The accuracy estimates obtained are quite similar
to the accuracy estimates of physical parameters from other works,
for example from (Gonz√°lez Delgado et al. 2021). The average value
of S/N in our sample is ‚àº 10 but our resolution is over two times
worse than in miniJPAS survey (FWHM Ô¨Ålters is 100 √Ö) thus, the
accuracy of our estimates is lower.

The colour-mass diagrams in Figure 12 show that the value of
errors in determining the physical parameters of galaxies is not the
same for diÔ¨Äerent populations of galaxies. The bimodality of the
distribution is clearly visible in the diagrams showing the error of
determining both the mass-weighted age and the age of the main
stellar population. For red sequence galaxies, this value rarely exceeds
(ùúé(log(age)M) ‚â§ 0.1 dex and ùúé(log(age)L) ‚â§ 0.1 dex). In addition,
the mass of the main stellar population is also determined better for
red galaxies ùúé(log(ùëÄ) [ùëÄ(cid:12) ] ) ‚â§ 0.1 dex than for blue cloud galaxies
and ùúé(ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res is constrained slightly better in the red sequence

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì16 (2021)

than in the blue cloud. The uncertainties in ùê¥V are the same for blue
cloud galaxies, while a higher value of ùúé( ùê¥V) corresponds to more
massive galaxies in the red sequence.

6 DISCUSSION

The accuracy of the estimation of photometric redshifts in our sam-
ple of galaxies (ùúéNMAD < 0.0043) makes it possible to study the
evolution of the physical properties of galaxies with cosmic time.
Our survey is actually the largest in the area (the total homogeneous
area is 2.386 deg2) among the mid-band deep surveys at the moment,
which makes its data fairly homogeneous and complete. SuÔ¨Écient
SED resolution (FWHM of a medium-band Ô¨Ålter is 250 √Ö) makes it
possible to divide galaxies into a red sequence and a blue cloud and
to study their properties independently of each other through cosmic
time.

In our work, there was no goal of a detailed study of the evolution
and formation of galaxies depending on the redshift. We investigated
the physical properties of galaxies in general and compared the re-
sults obtained with previous works by other authors. For the correct
interpretation of the results, it is necessary to consider that there
is a limit on the visibility of galaxies of a certain absolute galaxy
magnitude at a certain redshift (Malmquist bias, Malmquist 1922).
Thus, the least massive galaxies fall out of the Ô¨Åeld of our consider-
ation with an increase in redshift. We leave the study of the bias to
the region of more massive galaxies outside this work. However, it
should be noted that Figure 13 shows that galaxies with a mass less
than 108M(cid:12) occur only at lower redshifts.

To analyze the general physical properties of galaxies, we planned
to use photometry obtained in Kron-like apertures. However, in the
study‚Äôs course, data were obtained that showed that Kron-like pho-
tometry is eÔ¨Äective only for galaxies up to ùëüAB = 20.5 mag, then
the uncertainties associated with determining the Kron radius for ob-
jects arise due to the insuÔ¨Écient signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, for
objects fainter than ùëüAB = 20.5 mag, we used aperture photometry.

6.1 Evolution of galaxy populations in the mass - age diagram

Like the colour-mass diagram, the bimodality in the distribution
of galaxies is quite clearly visible in the mass-age log(ùëÄ)[M(cid:12) ] ‚àí
log(age)M (Fig. 14). The oldest galaxies in the sample have redder
colours, a larger mass, and a higher metallicity value.

In recent works (KauÔ¨Ämann et al. 2003; Gonz√°lez Delgado et al.
2014, 2021), it is shown that bimodality is also observed because
galaxies from the blue cloud have a linear dependence of age on the
stellar mass of the galaxy. In our work, we also Ô¨Ånd this dependence
(Fig. 13, bottom panels). This dependence is most clearly manifested
if we analyze galaxies from the same cosmic epochs. For this purpose,
we divided our sample into three bins: ùëß ‚â§ 0.25, 0.25 < ùëß ‚â§ 0.5
and 0.5 < ùëß ‚â§ 0.8. At a small redshift, the mass-age ratio shows a
change in the dependence‚Äôs slope for galaxies with a mass greater
than log(ùëÄ)[M(cid:12) ] = 10.5 dex, for which the ratio log(ùëÄ)[M(cid:12) ] ‚àí
log(age)M is becoming slightly sloping in comparison with the late-
type galaxies. This mass limit refers to the green valley galaxies,
which are the transition from the blue cloud to the red sequence.
Analyzing the red galaxies of all three bins by redshift, it is noticeable
that with decreasing age, the mass of the galaxy also decreases. Thus,
we can assume that the least massive galaxies formed in later cosmic
epochs.

6.2 Evolution of galaxy populations in the mass - age diagram

with extinction correction

Dust extinction reddens galaxies, so it is important to study the
colour - mass ratio not only for the colour (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res in the rest-
frame but also for the colour (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)int in the rest-frame corrected for
extinction (so-called intrinsic colour). After extinction correction,
the ratio between the galaxies of the red sequence and the blue cloud
changes signiÔ¨Åcantly (Schawinski et al. 2014; D√≠az-Garc√≠a et al.
2019).

Figure 14 shows the distribution of galaxies in the colour-mass

diagram for the rest-frame colour (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res and for the intrinsic
colour (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)int in three redshift bins: ùëß ‚â§ 0.25, 0.25 < ùëß ‚â§ 0.5,
and 0.5 < ùëß ‚â§ 0.8. It can be seen that the distribution of galaxies in
the colour - mass diagram for the rest frame colour (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res and
the intrinsic colour (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)int diÔ¨Äer signiÔ¨Åcantly in each redshift bin.
With introducing of the extinction correction, a signiÔ¨Åcant part of
the galaxies from the green valley passes into the blue cloud. This
is because a signiÔ¨Åcant part of the green valley galaxies is obscured
star-forming galaxies (30‚Äì65 per cent; D√≠az-Garc√≠a et al. 2019), the
proportion of which depends on the redshift and stellar mass. The
proportion of such galaxies in the near Universe is not large, but

it is not negligible (Schawinski et al. 2014). At high redshifts, the
proportion of dusty green valley galaxies increases even more.

6.3 IdentiÔ¨Åcation of blue and red galaxies

We use the technique of dividing galaxies into a red sequence and a
blue cloud, developed in the (D√≠az-Garc√≠a et al. 2019) for galaxies
from the ALHAMBRA survey in the redshift range from 0.1 ‚â§ ùëß ‚â§
1.1. The ALHAMBRA survey used a set of 20 mid-band Ô¨Ålters in the
optical range, as well as near-infrared Ô¨Ålters J, H, and Ks. Using the
SED-Ô¨Åtting method, the authors determined the physical properties
of galaxy populations, such as stellar mass, rest-frame colour, and
extinction of each galaxy. This allowed them to divide the galaxies
from the sample into a red sequence and a blue cloud. They found the
proportion of dusty star-forming galaxies in the green valley using
intrinsic colours and contamination in the samples of rest-frame
galaxies, determined using classical colour diagrams, caused by the
obscuring of star-forming galaxies. The authors concluded that the
use of a mass - colour diagram can reduce the contamination of a
part of the galaxies from the red sequence by 20 per cent compared
with the use of colour - colour diagrams.

In the (D√≠az-Garc√≠a et al. 2019, eq.3), the equation deÔ¨Åning the
limit of the separation of galaxies into a red sequence and a blue
cloud used the true colours for the ùëöùêπ 365 and ùëöùêπ 551 Ô¨Ålters. In
(Gonz√°lez Delgado et al. 2021, eq.5), this criterion was recalculated
into colours (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)int that similar to our photometric system. So we
can use this equation 2 with no corrections.

stellar mass.

res else galaxies are

colour is redder than the limiting value (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)lim
star-forming.

6.4 Characterization of blue and red galaxies

Using the criterion for selecting star-forming and quiet galaxies from
the equation 2, we obtained that about ‚àº 86 per cent of the sample
from our survey are blue cloud galaxies, and the share of red sequence
galaxies accounts for the remaining ‚àº 14 per cent.

Figure 15 shows distributions of properties of stellar populations
for two separate galaxy populations for the rest-frame (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)res
colour, total stellar mass, extinction ùê¥ùë£ . In common red galaxies
have a redder colour (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)int and lower extinction. Also, galaxies
from the red sequence are more massive.

The separation of galaxies into two groups using the colour - mass
diagram can be justiÔ¨Åed either by diÔ¨Äerences in the evolutionary path
of the galaxy or by diÔ¨Äerences in stellar content. Next, we will discuss
the dependence of the properties of stellar populations of galaxies on
redshift.

In Figure 16, we investigate the evolution of the intrinsic colour,
stellar mass, and age of galaxies through redshift. We obtain average
estimates of these characteristics of galaxies for each bin by redshift.
Red and blue galaxies are distributed on these diagrams according to
their stellar component.

The (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)int colour distribution shows that both red and blue
galaxies become bluer at high redshifts. For red galaxies, the Ô¨Årst

of the age values of galaxies occurs because of the limitations of computing power for the initial set of calculated values.

redshift bin shows a slightly bluer (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)int colour than on interme-
diate redshifts.

On average, blue galaxies are about 0.8 dex lighter than red ones.
At the same time, a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in this diÔ¨Äerence is observed
for the galaxy of the near Universe (ùëß ‚â§ 0.1), this may be due to
a shift caused by the fact that faint galaxies become invisible with
an increase in redshift. In addition, the average mass in each of the
galaxy populations increases with the growth of the redshift should
be associated with the same reason.

The galaxies of the red sequence and the blue cloud are quite well
separated in the diagram showing the stellar age. At any redshift, red
galaxies are older by ‚àº 0.35 dex. This is probably a consequence
of diÔ¨Äerent histories of star formation (SFH) and/or the formation
of blue and red galaxies. The age of both blue and red galaxies
decreases with increasing redshift, indicating ongoing star formation
and/or reÔ¨Çecting a biased sample for low-mass galaxies at higher
redshifts.

6.5 Star formation rate density

The most prominent result in the study of the evolution of galaxies
through the redshift is that it has been established that the star for-
mation rate density has a peak at ùëß ‚àº 3 and is decreasing until the
present cosmic time (Lilly et al. 1996; Madau et al. 1998; Hopkins &
Beacom 2006; Fardal et al. 2007; Gunawardhana et al. 2013; Madau
& Dickinson 2014; Driver et al. 2018).

In order to study the star formation rate density (SFRD), it is
necessary to study the incompleteness of our sample and the limits of
detection of the stellar mass depending on the redshift. It is necessary

to Ô¨Ånd the minimum and maximum redshifts (ùëßmin and ùëßmax) at which
each galaxy of the sample can be detected because of the detection
limits of cMOSS. The sample consists of galaxies in the range from
15.1 to 22.5 mag in ùëü SDSS Ô¨Ålter, which we used as constraints.
In order to estimate the maximum and minimum redshifts, we used
the limits for detecting stellar magnitudes in cMOSS sample and the
properties of the stellar population obtained using the cigale code.
The average values of ùëßmin and ùëßmax were obtained in bins by the
stellar mass with a width of Œîlog(ùëÄ) = 0.2 dex.

Figure 17 shows the result of our estimates of the detection limit
by stellar mass as a function of the redshift. Galaxies with a mass
of log(ùëÄ)[M(cid:12) ] ‚àº 10 dex can be detected in the entire redshift
range (ùëß ‚â§ 0.8) presented in the sample. Low-mass galaxies of
log(ùëÄ)[M(cid:12) ] ‚àº 8.0 can be detected up to ùëß = 0.15. Also Figure
17 show that we are able to study samples of galaxies with stellar
masses above log(ùëÄ)[M(cid:12) ] ‚àº 8.9, 9.5, and 9.9 dex at ùëß = 0.4, 0.6,
and 0.8, respectively.

Thus, our results allow us to study the SFRD for galaxies in the
redshift range ùëß ‚â§ 0.15 using the star formation history (SFH) for
galaxies in the gMOSS sample obtained by the cigale code. At the
upper limit of the redshift range (ùëß = 0.15), the sample of galaxies
includes galaxies with a mass above 108 M(cid:12). Galaxies with a mass
below this limit have contributed signiÔ¨Åcantly to the history of star
formation over the past 4 Gyr. In the cMOSS galaxy sample, such
galaxies are detected in the range up to ùëß = 0.15, however, their
number does not assess the incompleteness of the sample.

To get SFRD, considering the eÔ¨Äect of the incompleteness of
volume, we divided the star-formation rate (SFR) of each galaxy at
0.005 ‚â§ ùëß ‚â§ 0.15 by its maximum co-moving volume (ùëâmax). Since

The complete sample is indicated by a black line, the galaxies of the red sequence are red, the blue clouds are blue.

only a small number of galaxies with a mass below 108 M(cid:12) are not
observed at ùëß = 0.15 (‚àº 3 per cent), we can assume that ùëâmax is equal
to the co-moving volume ùëâc at this redshift range:

ùëâmax = Œîùëâ = ùëâc (ùëß = 0.15) ‚àí ùëâc (ùëß = 0.005).

(2)

However, the redshift bin 0.005 ‚â§ ùëß ‚â§ 0.15 includes a small
number of galaxies from the total sample (1250 galaxies), so it is also
necessary to estimate the cosmic variance for this redshift range in
survey area (2.386 deg2). We used the equations for cosmic variance

obtained in the work by Driver & Robotham (2010) and got the
cosmic variance estimation 39.3 per cent for our survey parameters.
This value is quite large and may explain the diÔ¨Äerences between
SFRD values estimated for the same redshift interval in diÔ¨Äerent
articles.

The SFRs were obtained from the parametric delayed SFH with

dispersion with respect to the average values is shown as error bars. Blue and red dots correspond to the blue cloud and red sequence galaxies, respectively.

6.6 Stellar-mass density

Given the volume incompleteness eÔ¨Äect from Section 6.5, we can
calculate the SMD as the ratio of the sum of the stellar mass of each
galaxy obtained using the cigale code to the co-moving volume
(ùëâmax), in the redshift bin 0.05 ‚â§ ùëß ‚â§ 0.15. For other redshift ranges,
the SMD value is calculated by integrating the SFRD function over
cosmic time.

Figure 19 shows the SMD (stellar-mass density) as a function of
cosmic time, compared to the Madau & Dickinson (2014, blue dots)
Ô¨Åt, the L√≥pez Fern√°ndez et al. (2018, orange solid line), the Driver
et al. (2018, green dots), and the S√°nchez et al. (2019, purple dots)
compilations of literature estimates. As with SFRD(ùëß), a trend is
similar to those reported on previous studies based mostly on large
cosmological surveys. SMD grows rapidly in the early cosmological
epochs, increasing from ‚àº 106.5M(cid:12) Mpc‚àí3 in the Ô¨Årst 3-4 Gyrs,
reaching a level above ‚àº 108.2M(cid:12) Mpc‚àí3 by the current era. This
shape of the SMD curve has been well described in works based on
cosmological surveys (Madau & Dickinson 2014; L√≥pez Fern√°ndez
et al. 2018, and others). The obtained result is slightly lower than the
values from previous studies, which is explained by the diÔ¨Äerence in
the operation of the SED-Ô¨Åtting algorithms, as well as the already
mentioned cosmic variance.

7 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented gMOSS, a new medium-band photometric cata-
logue that covers 2.386 deg2 of the HS47.5-22 Ô¨Åeld, which includes
measurements of 16 medium-band and 4 broadband Ô¨Ålters of the
SDSS system (we publish general Ô¨Çuxes and corresponding uncer-
tainties of 1ùúé), and photometric redshifts of 19,875 galaxies. The
sample of galaxies in the gMOSS survey is limited by threshold
magnitude ùëüAB = 22.5 mag. Also, we present the spectral redshifts
obtained from observations at the 6-meter Russian telescope with
SCORPIO-2 multi-mode focus reducer for selected galaxies in the
HS47.5-22 Ô¨Åeld.

We applied the SED-Ô¨Åtting code cigale to extract the star for-
mation history of 12,281 galaxies up to ùëß = 0.8. We used a set of
spectral evolution synthesis models from the BC03 set Bruzual &
Charlot (2003), with the modiÔ¨Åed attenuation law by Calzetti et al.
(2000) and assuming the initial mass function of Chabrier (2003).
We have obtained the stellar mass, rest frame and internal (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)
colours, extinction, age and metallicity of galaxy stellar populations.
The standard deviations in the stellar population parameters are:
0.19 ¬± 0.08 mag, 0.12 ¬± 0.05 dex, 0.10 ¬± 0.04 dex, and 0.28 ¬± 0.09

a nearly linear increase of the SFR from the onset of star formation
and after peaking at ùë° = ùúè, it smoothly decreases.

The error of log ùúå in each epoch is obtained by propagating the
SFRD dispersion in each bin. The results shown in Figure 18 demon-
strate that log ùúå increases with redshift, up to ùëß ‚àº 3.0 and then
decreases.

We compared the results obtained with those already known in the
literature in the works (Panter et al. 2007; Madau & Dickinson 2014;
Driver et al. 2018; L√≥pez Fern√°ndez et al. 2018; S√°nchez et al. 2019;
Leja et al. 2019; Bellstedt et al. 2020; Gonz√°lez Delgado et al. 2021).
These results are obtained from diÔ¨Äerent data samples and using
diÔ¨Äerent analysis techniques. Overall, we conclude that the analysis
of gMOSS sample provides results that are in good agreement with
cosmological surveys (Madau & Dickinson 2014; Driver et al. 2018)
and the nearby galaxies analysis f SDSS (Panter et al. 2007), IFS
CALIFA (L√≥pez Fern√°ndez et al. 2018), and GAMA (Bellstedt et al.
2020).

Figure 18. SFRD evolution through cosmic time was obtained from the SED-Ô¨Åtting results (gray line) with the nearby galaxies (0.05 ‚â§ ùëß ‚â§ 0.15, gray dot).
The grey shadow area represents the uncertainties of the result. The diÔ¨Äerent colour lines show the SFRDs obtained in other works.

easiest way to split a full galaxy sample is to use the dust-corrected
(ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)int diagram. The percentage of the number of the red sequence
galaxies and the blue cloud galaxies is 14 per cent and 86 per cent,
respectively. The properties of stellar populations clearly diÔ¨Äer be-
tween red sequence and blue cloud galaxies. Red and blue galaxies
are identiÔ¨Åed by their (ùë¢ ‚àí ùëü)int colour, with mean values ‚àº 2 and
‚àº 1. Throughout the full redshift range (0 < ùëß ‚â§ 0.8), red galaxies
are older and more massive than blue ones.

The evolution of galaxies with redshift shows that at the present
cosmic time galaxies are older than at ùëß = 0.8. The average mass of
galaxies increases with increasing redshift, which is a manifestation
of the selection of a Ô¨Çux-limited sample.

As part of the study of the star formation rate density, we deter-
mined our sample is complete for galaxies with above log(ùëÄ)[M(cid:12) ] ‚àº
8.9, 9.5, and 9.9 dex at ùëß = 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8, respectively. Based on
the obtained SFRD data at ùëß ‚àº 0.1, we can estimate the evolution
of SFRD and SMD, getting a result that corresponds to the results
of previously published works of cosmological surveys. This adds to
the weight of evidence that the CSFH is now well known.
