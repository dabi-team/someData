Abstract 

Purpose: Patient-specific ridge filters provide a passive means to modulate proton energy to 

obtain a conformal dose. Here we describe a new framework for optimization of filter design and 

spot maps to meet the unique demands of ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) radiotherapy.  We 

demonstrate an Integrated Biological Optimization IMPT (IBO-IMPT) approach for optimization 

of dose, dose-averaged dose rate (DADR), and dose-averaged LET (LETd). 

Methods: We developed inverse planning software to design patient-specific ridge filters that 

spread the Bragg peak from a fixed-energy, 250 MeV beam to a proximal beam-specific 

planning target volume (BSPTV). The software defines patient-specific ridge filter pin shapes 

and uses a Monte Carlo calculation engine, based on Geant4, to provide dose and LET influence 

matrices. Plan optimization, using matRAD, accommodates the IBO-IMPT objective function 

considering dose, dose rate, and LET simultaneously with minimum MU constraints. The 

framework enables design of both regularly spaced and sparse-optimized ridge filters, from 

which some pins are omitted to allow faster delivery and selective LET optimization. Volume 

distributions and histograms for dose, DADR, and LETd are compared using evaluation 

structures specific to the heart and lung. 

Results: To demonstrate the framework, we used IBO-IMPT to design ridge filters for a central 

lung tumor patient. The IBO-IMPT framework selectively spared heart and lung by reducing 

LET and increasing dose rate, relative to conventional IMPT planning. Sparse-optimized ridge 

filters were superior to regularly spaced ridge filters in dose rate. Together, these innovations 

substantially increased the DADR in the heart and lung while maintaining good dose coverage 

within the BSPTV. The volume that received a FLASH dose rate of ≥ 40 Gy/second increased by 

31% for heart and 50% for lung. 

Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of using an IBO-IMPT 

framework to accomplish proton FLASH SBPT, accounting for dose, DADR, and LETd 

simultaneously.

Introduction 

Although stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) provides excellent local tumor control, it 

poses unacceptable risks in a subset of patients. For example, patients with central and ultra-

central lung tumors are at a 15% risk of fatal hemorrhage based on impingement of the complex 

overlapping radiation fields on organs at risk (OARs), including uninvolved lung, heart, and 

esophagus 1–4. Stereotactic body proton therapy (SBPT) represents an advancement over SBRT 

5,6, as it uses fewer beams and delivers much of the dose in a patient-specific spread-out Bragg 

Peak (SOBP), sparing proximal and especially distal OARs. Even with SBPT 6,7, there is 

necessarily some treatment margin 8–12, which may impact OARs and thus limit clinical 

applicability 13. 

FLASH radiotherapy is a novel modality with the potential to provide further sparing of OARs 

beyond that offered by conventional SBPT. Recent mouse studies using electron or scattered 

proton transmission FLASH suggest that the toxicities to serial OARs, such as the esophagus, 

may be reduced by 30%-50%, while maintaining anti-tumor efficacy14,15. The current generation 

of proton therapy machines are, in many cases, capable of achieving FLASH dose rates (e.g., 40-

800 Gy/second). Typically, irradiation is performed using a high-energy transmission beam16. 

Energy modulation is impractical, given that characteristic energy modulation times (>500 

milliseconds)17–19 exceed the total time allowed for FLASH delivery (250 milliseconds for a 

typical 10 Gy SBPT dose). Unfortunately, the use of the transmission beam sacrifices a major 

advantage of proton therapy: the ability to deliver dose in a SOBP. For small SBPT targets other 

than extremities, the increased spillover to serial OARs can more than offset FLASH sparing.  

There are several passive, and thus dose rate-independent, approaches that can be used to 

improve conformality at FLASH dose rates20–23. One is to use a range compensator to position a 

Bragg peak within the target. For a high beam-current proton facility, multi-field optimized 

IMPT with a universal range shifter and compensator can achieve FLASH delivery22. Another 

approach is to use a universal machine-specific ridge filter in scattered proton mode15,24,25. This 

achieves a SOBP with a single field, although the dose distribution is not conformal to the target. 

A third approach, which is the subject of the the present study, is to combine a patient-specific 

ridge filter with a range compensator to achieve a single field-optimized (SFO), IMPT-like 

conformal dose distribution18,26.  

3 

 
Although patient-specific ridge filters have clear advantages, designing such filters is 

challenging. Specifically, there is an unmet need to optimize ridge filter design and spot maps to 

maximize sparing of organs at risk. Because dose, dose-averaged dose rate 27, and dose-averaged 

LET (LETd)28,29  each influence the biological response, simultaneous optimization of all three 

factors is desirable. The integrated biological optimization (IBO)-IMPT framework described 

here achieves this goal and thus represents an advance over other currently available approaches. 

Using this framework, we found that sparse ridge filters (from which some pins have been 

omitted) offer advantages over regularly-spaced ridge filters (hereafter referred to as regular 

ridge filters) by enabling higher dose rates at specific locations, maximizing the FLASH effect.

Materials and Methods 

3D Ridge filter design 

The beam-specific planning target volume (BSPTV) 8,30 is used to design the patient-specific ridge 

filters.    Fig.  1  illustrates  the  methodology  for  filter  design  and  fabrication.  Fig.  1A  shows  an 

enlarged  view  of  a  stepwise-tapered  single  ridge  pin.  Each  modulation  step  creates  a  separate 

Bragg peak. The weight (cross sectional area of the step) and thickness (height) of each step are 

denoted by variables wi and ti. These are used as inputs to the equation (1), where Di represents the 

dose at the i-th Bragg peak and  𝐵(cid:4666)𝑡(cid:3036), 𝑗(cid:4667) is the depth dose of the Bragg peak by the i-th modulation 

ridge thickness at position 𝑗. We generate the 𝐵(cid:4666)𝑛, 𝑚(cid:4667) matrix of 𝑛 Bragg curves consisting of 𝑚 

points  through  Geant4  simulation.  We  generate  the  ridge  filter  information  file  by  solving  the 

equation set (1) using the least square method (equation (2)) to provide the area 𝑤𝑖 of thickness 𝑡𝑖.

Achieving the desired, IMPT-like dose distribution requires filter pin spacing that is much smaller 

than the Gaussian sigma of the proton spots. This assures that proton energies will be mixed in the 

desired proportion.  

We then extend the single pin optimization to multiple pins, which are arranged to cover the 

whole tumor volume. The optimized weight factors are translated to the geometrical parameters 

of the filter pin. The filter pin positions are defined in beam eye view (BEV)  (Fig. 1B). The 

complete assembly includes both filter pins and a range compensator (Fig. 1C).  FreeCAD 

(http://www.freecadweb.org) is then used to generate a 3D printing stereolithography file, and 

the filter assembly is printed using Accura Extreme31, which has a density of about 1.19 g/cm3 

(Fig. 1D). Micro-CT image is used to demonstrate that the ridge filter conforms to the design 

(Fig. 1E). We developed an in-house full Monte Carlo dose calculation engine for the patient-

Treatment planning system 

The patient’s 3D voxelized geometry file, ridge filter information file, and beam parameters 

including gantry angle and initial spot map are fed into Geant4 to obtain the 3D dose and LETd 

influence matrices 32,33 that serve as inputs for inverse optimization of spot weights, as shown in 

Fig. S1 in Supplementary Materials.  The open-source treatment planning toolkit, matRad 34,35, 

was used to develop a treatment planning system (TPS), implementing the IBO-IMPT 

framework to generate an optimized spot map that conforms to the target dose coverage and 

OAR constraints specified in the treatment plan. The matRad-based TPS determines the 

optimized spot map to meet the minimum MU constraint16. MatRad is written in MATLAB and 

relies on an interior point optimization package (IPOPT) 36 to solve the fluence optimization 

problem. It uses L-BFGS with a logarithmic barrier34 to implement the required boundary 

constraints. Specifically, we optimize the spot map based on the equation (3), which is the main 

objective function for optimization. A DADR quadratic term has been added to the objective 

function originally proposed by Liu and coworkers32,33, to allow simultaneous optimization of 

dose, DADR, and LETd simultaneously. Equation (4) describes the dose summation process 

using the weighted dose influence matrix. Equation (5) describes the calculation of DADR. 

Equation (6) describes the calculation of the minimum MU 37.

of protons per MU, respectively.  

Sparse ridge filters 

Regularly spaced ridge filters, designed using the IBO-IMPT framework, provide increased 

DADR for  some OARs while maintaining tumor coverage. However, the optimization does not 

take depth modulation into account. Sparse ridge filters, from which some pins are omitted, 

provide a means to further increase the DADR for optimal FLASH sparing.  

We use a heuristic decision process to generate the sparse ridge filters. We calculate the dose 

influence matrices for a regular ridge filter and for a range compensator alone with no pins. The 

filter pin location map is used as the proton spot map, so that the dose of each beamlet reflects 

the contribution of a specific ridge filter pin. Using these two dose influence matrices, we obtain 

an optimized IBO-IMPT plan (Fig. 2A). We then derive optimized spot weighting factors, 

where, 𝑤(cid:3037)

(cid:3045) is the weighting factor for filter pin location 𝑗 of regular ridge filter and 𝑤(cid:3037)

(cid:3047) is the 

weighting factor for pin location 𝑗 of filter compensator. We then test the effect of removing the 

pin at position j  to increase DADR.  We keep the pin at location 𝑗 if 

(cid:3295) (cid:3408) 𝑓(cid:3037) where 𝑓(cid:3037) is a

user-defined threshold; otherwise, otherwise we remove the pin.  The decision process is shown 

in Fig. 2B.  After selecting the pin locations, we generate the sparse ridge filter design (Fig. 2C). 

The sparse filter design allows higher DADRs for OARs, including lung and heart (Fig. 2D).

Example filter design and treatment plan 

To demonstrate the IBO-IMPT framework, we designed ridge filters and developed a treatment 

plan for an example lung cancer patient. Sparing of OARs was of particular concern, as the 

patient had previously been treated using conventional spot scanning proton therapy. The 

patient-specific ridge filter and range shifter assembly were designed to achieve conformal target 

dose coverage using a 250 MeV proton beam. BSPTV with 5% range uncertainty and 5 mm

setup uncertainty. For our scanning beam proton therapy system, using a minimum duration of 1 

millisecond and a constant current 300 nA, a value of 300 was taken as the minimum MU37. 

Three beam angles of 0º, 40º, and 320º were considered (denoted as T0, T40, and T320, 

respectively. The target was the clinical target volume (CTV), and two OARs, lung and heart, 

were considered for plan optimization. The prescribed dose to the CTV was 50 Gy (10 Gy × 5 

fractions). The entire volume received a dose ≥ 50 Gy, with a maximum allowable dose for 

hotspots corresponding to 125% of the prescription dose (62.5 Gy). The dose volume constraints 

for lung and heart are shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Materials.  

IBO-IMPT plans were generated for regular and sparse ridge filters at different beam angles and 

compared with each other and with conventional IMPT plans as detailed in the Result section. 

Evaluation was performed using an approach similar to that described by Feng et al. for LET-

guided optimization38.  To generate the evaluating structures, Heart_eva, and Lung_eva, we first 

created a uniform 5 mm expansion of the BSPTV. The 5 mm BSPTV expansion was chosen so 

as to include the gradual dose fall off beyond the BSPTV, recognizing that the dose within this 

margin region may exceed the lower threshold for a FLASH effect39–42. We next removed the 

CTV from the expanded BSPTV and defined Lung_EVA as the overlap between this and the 

lung (Fig. 3).  We generated the Heart_eva structure using a similar approach.  

The rationale for using the only the defined Heart_eva and Lung_eva volumes, rather than the 

whole heart and lung, was that evaluation of a very large structure might mask the significance 

of high dose or high dose rate due to a large volume with a low dose and low dose rate. Fig. 3 

shows the evaluation structures for the three beams. For the multiple beam plan, the overall 

evaluating structure is the Boolean union of the evaluation structures for each beam. 

For each plan, we calculated the distribution of dose, DADR, and LETd and generated 

corresponding volume histograms. The FLASH effect has been reported to have a dose threshold 

between 4 Gy to 10 Gy 39–42. Here, we used 4 Gy per fraction per field as a conservative 

estimate. The FLASH dose rate threshold has been reported to be between 40 and  100 Gy/s. 

Here, we used 40 Gy/s. For generating the dose rate volume histograms, we assigned the DADR 

as zero for the voxels that do not meet the dose threshold. Thus, we can directly observe the 

fraction of volume achieving FLASH by inspection of the DADR volume histogram, as only the 

voxels that meet the dose and dose rate thresholds contribute to the histogram.

Results 

IBO-IMPT with regular ridge filters 

To demonstrate the functionality of the IBO-IMPT framework, we used it to design a regular 

ridge filter and develop a treatment plan for a sample lung cancer patient. Fig. 4 shows dose, 

DADR, and LETd distributions, together with volume histograms, for a plan that was developed 

with the goal of reducing LETd to heart while maintaining target coverage. We compare this with 

a conventional IMPT plan (dose optimization only). The target coverages for the IBO-IMPT and 

IMPT plans are similar. However, the IBO-IMPT framework resulted in a marked reduction of 

LETd to the heart (compare Fig. 4C and 4F, see also Fig. 4I ).  

We also generated plans for several different beam orientations (T0, T40, and T320) where 

DADR optimization was prioritized, while maintaining adequate dose and LETd optimization 

(Fig. S2, S3, and S4). Together, these results demonstrate that adoption of the IBO-IMPT 

framework, in combination with regular ridge filters, results in at least modest improvements to 

DADR and LETd for OARs, while maintaining tumor coverage and meeting other constraints.

IBO-IMPT with sparse ridge filters 

Regular ridge filters, originally designed for dose optimization only, cannot fully realize the 

benefits of the IBO-IMPT framework, because spot-specific dose-depth modulation is not 

optimized. To address this, we explored sparse ridge filter designs, in which some pins are 

removed using the heuristic decision process described in Materials and Methods. 

An example of a fully optimized IBO-IMPT plan, with sparse ridge filters and multiple beams is 

shown in Figure 5. An IMPT-optimized plan using regular ridge filters is shown for comparison. 

Tumor coverage is maintained and hotspots are well controlled with both plans (compare Fig. 5A 

and 5D). The IBO-IMPT plan with sparse ridge filters results in a marked improvement to 

13 

 
 
DADR in the OARs (compare Fig. 5B and 5E). The volume that received a dose rate of ≥40 

Gy/second increased by 31% for Heart_eva and by 50% for Lung_eva increases by 50% (Fig. 

5H). The LETd for the two plans was substantially the same (compare Fig. 5C and 5F, see also 

Fig. 5I). Together, results show that the use of sparse ridge filters and multiple beams help 

realize the full potential of the IBO-IMPT framework.  

A separate set of optimized single-beam plans, using sparse ridge filters, is shown in Fig. S5, S6, 

and S7.  The increased DADR for lungs, using sparse ridge filters versus regular ridge filters, is 

evident. The individual plans have some hotspots within BSPTV (which slightly exceed the 

125% prescription dose), but sequential delivery as SBRT fractions reduces these and improves 

target coverage. Together, dose coverage is similar to the multi-field plan in Fig. 5, but with 

better FLASH sparing due to the dose threshold per fraction per field.

Preliminary dose verification with a patient-specific ridge filter 

To verify the ability of the ridge filter assembly to deliver the predicted dose, we performed 

proton dose measurements.  The ridge filter assembly (shown in Fig 1D), which consists of filter 

pins and a compensator, was placed on T0 beam axis (Fig. S8A). A range shifter, solid water, 

and an ionization chamber array were placed downstream (Fig. S8B).  We delivered a treatment 

plan optimized for our example lung cancer patient and designed to provide uniform dose to 

CTV target. The calculated dose distribution, 25 mm depth from the solid water surface is shown 

in Fig. S8C. The corresponding measured dose is shown in Fig. S8D. The total gamma passing 

rate was 92% (3mm/3%) (Fig. S8), which exceeds the standard patient QA passing criteria of 

90%. Results provide a preliminary demonstration that the ridge filter assembly can facilitate 

delivery of a clinically acceptable dose distribution. Further verification of FLASH timing, dose 

rate, and LET, using a novel time-resolved and spatially-resolved detector, is in progress and will 

be reported separately. 

15 

 
 
 
Discussion 

In this feasibility study, we demonstrate how the use of the IBO-IMPT framework and optimized 

ridge filters can improve DADR and LETd, for lung and heart, relative to a plan generated using a 

standard IMPT approach. The IBO-IMPT framework, which explicitly incorporates objective 

functions of dose, DADR, and LETd, provides degenerate solutions for patient-specific ridge 

filter and spot maps while providing an ability to study the contribution of each term27. 

Optimization of DADR and LETd, while maintaining a similar dose distribution, is crucial for 

disentangling the biological contributions of DADR and LET from that of dose per se. For OARs 

such as great vessels, which have a maximum tolerated dose close to the prescription dose, 

increasing the DADR above the FLASH threshold (≥40 Gy/sec) may be the best selection. 

Alternatively, lower dose or LET might be a better option for OARs, such as spinal cord, which 

have a maximum tolerated dose that is smaller than the prescription dose. Such options can be 

explored using the IBO-IMPT optimization framework. 

One of applications of IBO-IMPT is the design of sparse ridge filter/compensator assemblies, 

from which some pins have been omitted. The sparse ridge filters are more efficient than regular 

filters, providing more flexibility to improve the DADR.  Use of the sparse filters can lead to 

some hotspots within the CTV, although this can be mitigated by alternating the beam 

orientation over SBRT fractions. The sparse ridge filter design process is currently based on a 

heuristic method. Several trial and error iterations are generally required to achieve an acceptable 

result. It should be possible to improve on this approach, for example by developing a faster dose 

calculation engine for patient-specific ridge filters, which would allow combination of the ridge 

filter and plan optimization processes through a stepwise optimization scheme or using mixed-

integer programming. This would allow simultaneous optimization of the proton spot map and 

the filter pin location map.   

It is important to note that the biological mechanism of FLASH sparing remains a subject of 

active investigation. IBO-IMPT optimization can assist this work by enabling biologists to 

separate the contribution of LET from dose rate effects. With the IBO-IMPT framework, 

different beam designs can be examined in parallel to determine the contribution of each term.  

When better biological models of the FLASH effect are available, the IBO-IMPT can be 

extended to incorporate them directly, rather than indirectly via DADR and LETd terms. Other 

16 

 
examples include replacing the DADR with other dose rate approaches in IBO-IMPT16,43. The 

work here assumed a constant beam current, which allowed a simplified optimization model for 

DADR, keeping spot MUs as the sole decision variables. Solutions for adding current as a 

decision variable exist in literature44,  however, and could be integrated into the IBO-IMPT 

framework in the future. 

Conclusion 

This proof-of-concept study demonstrates to solve for dose, DADR, and LETd, using an 

integrated biological optimization framework. Example solutions include regular and sparse 

patient-specific ridge filters and spot maps designed prioritize dose, DADR, and LETd for 

optimal sparing of heart and lung. This novel method will facilitate delivery of conformal proton 

fields at FLASH rates for preclinical and clinical studies.
