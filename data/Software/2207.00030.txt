Spin precession in merging black-hole binaries is a treasure trove for both astrophysics and
fundamental physics. There are now well-established strategies to infer from gravitational-wave data
whether at least one of the two black holes is precessing. In this paper we tackle the next-in-line
target, namely the statistical assessment that the observed system has two precessing spins. We
ﬁnd that the recently-developed generalization of the eﬀective precession spin parameter χp is a
well-suited estimator to this task. With this estimator, the occurrence of two precessing spins is a
necessary (though not suﬃcient) condition to obtain values 1 < χp ≤ 2. Conﬁdent measurements of
gravitational-wave sources with χp values in this range can be taken as a conservative assessment
that the binary presents two precessing spins. We investigate this argument using a large set of >100
software injections assuming anticipated LIGO/Virgo sensitivities for the upcoming fourth observing
run, O4. Our results are very encouraging, suggesting that, if such binaries exist in nature and
merge at a suﬃcient rate, current interferometers are likely to deliver the ﬁrst conﬁdent detection of
merging black holes with two precessing spins. We investigate prior eﬀects and waveform systemics
and, though these need to be better investigated, did not ﬁnd any conﬁdent false-positive case among
all the conﬁgurations we tested. Our assessment should thus be taken as conservative.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Black-hole (BH) binary spin precession is a key feature
of the relativistic two-body problem [1, 2]. Spin-spin
and spin-orbit couplings in General Relativity cause the
orbital angular momentum L and the BH spins S1,2 to
jointly precess about the direction of the total angular
momentum J = L + S1 + S2. This motion induces
modulations to both the amplitude and the phase of the
emitted gravitational waves (GWs).

Measurements of spin precession have important reper-
cussions in both astrophysics and fundamental physics.
For the stellar-mass BH binaries observed by LIGO and
Virgo [3, 4], spin precession provides unique leverage to
discriminate between BH binaries formed in isolation and
those assembled in dynamically in stellar clusters [5–8].
For the supermassive BH binaries targeted by LISA [9],
spin measurements will provide information on, e.g., the
occurrence of prolonged phases of disk accretion [10, 11].
GW observations of precessing binary BHs also allow us
to constrain modiﬁed theories of gravity, especially those
with parity-violating interactions caused by additional
ﬁelds [12].

While the masses of LIGO/Virgo events are usually well
measured, spin eﬀects provide a subdominant contribution
to the emitted radiation and are thus considerably more
challenging to characterize. At present, an unambiguous
measurement of BH-binary spin precession is one of the
holy grails of observational GW astronomy. Data from the
ﬁrst three observing runs of the LIGO/Virgo network [13–
16] have provided relatively mild evidence for individual

BH mergers with highly precessing spins. The most sug-
gestive indication is that from GW200129_065458 [16–19],
where some, but not all, analyses point toward substantial
precession eﬀects, ultimately indicating that waveform
systematics might not be under control. For the case
of GW190521, a strong precession signature was also
reported [14], though potential degeneracies with the ec-
centricity still need to be fully understood [20]. Collective
evidence for spin precession was reported in the context
of BH binary populations, with all current ﬁts requiring
some misaligned spins at high conﬁdence [21–23].

Upcoming instrumental upgrades to the LIGO/Virgo
(and hopefully KAGRA) network [24] are posed to provide
increasingly accurate spin measurements. Given that
we are already on the verge of such a detection, it is
not unreasonable to predict that next observing run will
deliver the ﬁrst conﬁdent, unambiguous identiﬁcation of
BH-binary spin precession. Crucially, measuring orbital-
plane precession corresponds to inferring that at least
one of the two BHs has a misaligned spin [1]. Inferring
the presence of two misaligned spins requires extracting
even feebler signatures from the signal, which are related
to spin-spin (as opposed to spin-orbit) terms in the BH
binary equations of motion.

This paper tackles such a next-in-line target. We per-
form > 100 software injections with realistic LIGO/Virgo
sensitivity and demonstrate that signals with large-but-
not-extreme signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (cid:38) 20 allow us
detect two-spin eﬀects already in the next LIGO/Virgo
observing run (O4). Of course, this statement relies on the
assumption that merging binaries with two large precess-
ing spins exist and can merge eﬃciently. But if such
GW sources are out there in the Universe, the next
LIGO/Virgo run might provide the ﬁrst observational

 
 
 
 
 
 
constraints of their properties.

Compared to previous analyses which include two pre-
cessing spins (e.g., [25–27]) our investigation relies on a
state-of-the-art reformulation of the precession estimator
χp [28]. This generalizes the commonly used expres-
sion [29] by employing a rigorous PN-informed average
over the joint evolution of both spins. Measurements of
such an augmented χp for current GW events have been
presented in Refs. [28, 30]. Crucially for this paper, the
precession-averaged estimator presents an exclusion region
1 < χp
2 that can only be populated by binaries with
two precessing spins. Measuring a binary with χp > 1
at some large conﬁdence (GW astronomers often use the
90% Bayesian credible interval), would allow us to claim
the ﬁrst detection of binary BH physics sourced by two
precessing spins.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present
our methodology, including details on the adopted pre-
cession estimator as well as the implemented parameter-
estimation pipeline. In Sec. III we present the results of
our analysis. In particular, we characterize (i) the SNR
dependence on the resulting χp posterior distributions,
(ii) the statistical behavior of large ensembles of sources,
(iii) the impact of the prior, and (iv) the relevance of wave-
form systematics. Our conclusions are reported in Sec. IV.
In the following we employ geometric units G = c = 1.

II. METHODS

A. Spin precession estimators

While the full BH-binary spin properties are in princi-
ple described by six degrees of freedom (three components
for two spin vectors), a considerable amount of eﬀort has
been devoted to identifying a reduced number of param-
eters that encapsulate most of the information. These
are often derived in a post-Newtonian (PN) framework,
with the most widely-used quantities being the eﬀective
aligned spin χeﬀ [31–33] and the eﬀective precessing spin
χp [28, 29]. Alternative approaches include extending
the precession estimator to a two-dimensional vector [34],
exploiting the precession/nutation amplitudes and fre-
quencies [35, 36], and computing the fraction of the SNR
contained in the spin modulations [37].

Let us consider a BH binary where q = m2/m1

1
is the mass ratio, χi
[0, 1] are the dimensionless spin
magnitudes, θi are the angles between the spins and the
orbital angular momentum, and ∆Φ is the angle between
the projections of the two spins onto the orbital plane.

≤

∈

The eﬀective aligned spin is deﬁned as [31]

χeﬀ =

χ1 cos θ1 + qχ2 cos θ2
1 + q

.

(1)

This is the spin quantity that aﬀects the GW phase at
lowest order and is a constant of motion at 2PN [32, 33].
The eﬀective spin χeﬀ was recognized as the best measured
spin parameter since the very ﬁrst GW detections, the

2

key reason being that it directly impacts the length of
the signal.

The spin-precession parameter χp

tracks the
change of the direction of the orbital angular momentum
L over time t
It was originally introduced
by Schmidt et al. [29] as a building block toward the
construction of precessing waveforms. Their deﬁnition
reads

which in this paper we refer to as “heuristic χp.” This pre-
cessing spin parameter is deﬁned in the domain χ(heu)
∈
[0, 1]. Unlike χeﬀ , the parameter χp depends on the
projections of the spins onto the orbital plane, χi sin θi,
implying that a conﬁdent measurement of χp > 0 requires
at least one of the two BH spins was misaligned before
merger, and hence that the system was precessing.

Gerosa et al. [28] recently pointed out that Eq. (2)
was derived by preferentially selecting some terms when
averaging over the spin motion. Mathematically, this
is reﬂected in the maximization operation reported in
Eq. (2), which selects one of the two BHs as dominant
to the precession dynamics, thus obfuscating two-spin
eﬀects. Relaxing this approximation yields a generalized
parameter [28]

regarded as a more solid estimator because, although it is
not a constant of motion like χeﬀ , it at most varies only
over the longer radiation-reaction timescale. In the follow-
ing, we refer to Eq. (4) as the “averaged χp” parameter.
In practice, we perform the integral in Eq. (4) using a
2PN quasi-adiabatic approach where the precession cycle
is parametrized by S(t) =
[33, 38]. We

The reformulation of the precession parameter deﬁnes
an extended range χ(av)
[0, 2]. As shown in Ref. [28],
the heuristic and averaged deﬁnitions of χp have the same
single-spin limit, which implies that the range of the latter
cannot be freely absorbed with a normalization factor.
From Eq. (3), it is immediate to see that χp > 1 requires

B. Parameter estimation pipeline

As is common practice in GW parameter estimation,
we employ the following ﬁfteen parameters to describe
compact-binary coalescences: detector-frame total mass
M = m1 + m2, mass ratio q = m2/m1, dimensionless spin
magnitudes χ1,2, tilt angles θ1,2, azimuthal spin angle
∆Φ, azimuthal angle φJL between the total and orbital
angular momenta, luminosity distance DL, right ascension
α, declination δ, polar angle θJN between total angular
momentum and the line of sight, polarization ψ, time tc
and phase φc of coalescence [39].

We explore the joint Bayesian posterior distribution
of these parameters under a Gaussian noise likelihood
(e.g., [40]) using the parallelized Bilby pipeline [41, 42]
and its underlying Dynesty implementation of nested
sampling [43]. Our runs make use of 2048 live points,
a number of autocorrelation equal to 50 a random walk
sampling method, and a likelihood marginalized over time
and distance. Runs are halted when the log-evidence gain
falls below 0.1.

We consider a three-detector network consisting of
LIGO Livingston, LIGO Handford, and Virgo with their
projected sensitivities for the upcoming fourth observing
run O4 [24]. We consider data segments of 4 s, set a lower
frequency cutoﬀ of 20 Hz, assume a sampling frequency
of 2048 Hz, and zero noise. Time-varying quantities are
quoted when the detector-frame emission frequency of the
dominant mode is 20 Hz. This choice has a negligible im-
pact on the averaged χp estimator because it only varies
on the long inspiral timescale of the binary evolution; see
Ref. [28]. Unless stated otherwise, we quote our results
using medians and 90% equal-tailed credible intervals.

∈

We adopt uninformative priors as commonly used in cur-
rent LIGO/Virgo analyses [13–16]. Speciﬁcally, priors on
[5, 100]M(cid:12),
the masses are chosen to be uniform in m1,2
with further constraints imposed on the mass ratio q
∈
[1/8, 1] and detector-frame chirp mass Mc
[10, 60]M(cid:12).
For most of our runs, priors on the spins are taken to
[0, 0.99] and isotropic
be unform in magnitude χ1,2
in directions. In the following, we will refer to this as
our “standard” spin prior. To better explore prior eﬀects,
some of our runs are performed with a “volumetric” spin
i , corresponding to spin vectors that are
prior p(χi)
uniformly drawn in volume (e.g., [13, 44, 45]). The lumi-
nosity distance prior is taken to be uniform in comoving

into the two-spin region χp > 1. However, under these
commonly used assumptions, the tail at large χp values is
very sparsely populated. From Eq. (3), reaching χp

of our analysis and suggests that current GW data are
being analyzed with a prior that strongly disfavors the
region of parameter space that is exclusive to two-spin
physics. Although still present, this eﬀects is less promi-
nent for the volumetric spin prior. More quantitatively, we
ﬁnd p(χp > 1) = 0.02 and 0.07 for the averaged estimator
under the standard and volumetric prior, respectively.

For the majority of our runs, we employ the IMRPhe-
nomXPHM [46–48] waveform model for both injection
and recovery. This is a state-of-the-art frequency-domain
approximant that captures spin precession without relying
on a single-spin approximation. Selecting the same model
for both injection and recovery allows us to ﬁrst isolate
statistical eﬀects without systematics. Waveform system-
atics are then explored with a dedicated analysis where
we select diﬀerent models for injection and recovery. In
particular, we use the time-domain model IMRPhenomT-
PHM [49] as well as the numerical-relativity surrogate
NRSur7dq4 [50]. When recovering with NRSur7dq4,
we restrict our prior to q > 1/6, which corresponds to
the extended range of validity of the model. Because

this approximant only covers

we also restrict our priors to m1,2

III. RESULTS

A. Single-system series

p

= 0.67 and χ(av)

As a ﬁrst step, we highlight the main implications of
the χp reformulation on GW parameter estimation. To
this end, we present a series of six software injections
where the same binary is observed at diﬀerent SNRs. We
select a source with χ(heu)
p = 1.22 > 1,
which thus contains two prominently precessing spins. In
particular, the injected system has M = 54.1 M(cid:12), q =
0.96, χ1 = 0.56, χ2 = 0.7, θ1,2 = π/2, ∆Φ = 0.1, θJN =
1.0, φJL = 1.0, α = 0.75, δ = 0.5, ψ = 1.0, φc = π/4, tc =
0.0. We select increasing values of the luminosity distance
DL = 200, 500, 700, 900, 1300, 1700 Mpc while keeping
the detector-frame mass M ﬁxed. The corresponding
three-detector network SNRs are ρ = 124, 44, 35, 27, 19,
and 14. We use the IMRPhenomXPHM waveform model
for both injection and recovery and employ standard
uninformative priors.

Our results are illustrated in Fig. 2. As one moves
from the lowest to the highest value of the SNR, the
recovered posteriors of both the averaged and the heuristic
χp converge to the injected values. This is expected
because we have used the same signal model for injection

and recovery and we are not considering a speciﬁc noise
realization.

For the system with the lowest SNR ρ = 14, the posteri-
ors of our two χp deﬁnitions largely overlap. Quoting me-
dian and 90% credible interval, we ﬁnd χ(av)
p = 0.95+0.43
−0.37,
which implies that we cannot conﬁdently tell that the
source has two misaligned spins. As the SNR increases, so
does our ability to infer that the binary has two precess-
ing spins. For the system with the largest SNR ρ = 124,
the two marginalized χp distributions are almost com-
pletely detached. The posterior of the heuristic χp is
by deﬁnition truncated at χp = 1 because Eq. (2) al-
lows only for the contribution from a single, dominant
spin. On the contrary, considering our averaged deﬁnition
yields χp = 1.22+0.09
−0.09 for ρ = 124, implying one infers
the presence of two precessing spins with a credibility of
p(χp > 1) = 99.9%.

Figure 2 also shows that the posterior of the averaged
χp is closer to a Gaussian compared to that of the heuris-
tic estimator. This indicates that, if a signiﬁcant non-
Gaussianity in the heuristic χp posterior were to appear
in GW data, it could be taken as a potential indication
that some additional two-spin physics is present but is be-
ing missed because of the suboptimality of the employed
estimator.

B. Parameter-space exploration

Using the same settings, we now target the statisti-
cal properties emerging from a large number of injected
signals. Ideally, one would want to inject signals drawn
from the prior (this is necessary, for instance, to present
a probability-probability plot [52]). In our case, such a
procedure would be highly suboptimal and ultimately
computationally intractable because, as shown in Fig. 1,
the two-spin region with χp > 1 corresponds to a very
low prior volume (where from now on in the paper we
only refer to the average formulation of χp). Most of
the injections would thus be placed in the region where
only one of the two spins dominates. We thus opt for
an injection distribution with χp uniform in [0, 2] which,
although of dubious astrophysical relevance, is well suited
to asses the statistical property of the proposed estimator.
More precisely, we draw values of χp and then reweight
samples of the intrinsic binary properties drawn from
the uninformative prior (Sec. II B) to the injection dis-
tribution using an acceptance/rejection scheme with an
absolute numerical tolerance of 0.04 between the original
and resampled values of χp. We have veriﬁed that this
choice does not signiﬁcantly impact our results. Since
precession eﬀects are subdominant in the waveform, when
selecting the extrinsic properties for injections we only
consider sources with ρ > 20, i.e.,
2 times larger than
≈
the current detection threshold [16].

Figure 4 shows the recovered posteriors of the averaged
χp parameter as a function of the true values for 100 such
injections. One can divide the parameter space into four
distinct regions, acting much like a confusion matrix in
statistics.

(i) True negatives (bottom-left quadrant in Fig. 4):
injected χp < 1 and recovered χp < 1. The injected
conﬁgurations are not unique to sources with two
precessing spins and are recovered as such.

(ii) False positives (top-left quadrant in Fig. 4): injected
χp < 1 and recovered χp > 1. For these sources,
one infers the presence two precessing spins even if
they might not be present.

(iii) False negatives (bottom-right quadrant in Fig. 4):
injected χp > 1 and recovered χp < 1.
In this
region sources have two precessing spins but one is
not able infer their occurrence from the signal.

(iv) True positives (top-right quadrant in Fig. 4):

in-
jected χp > 1 and recovered χp > 1. These sources
are characterized by two precessing spins and one
can successfully infers that this is the case.

For each posterior distribution, we compute the fraction
of the samples in each of these four regions and then
compute the arithmetic mean over the injected sample
(this is equivalent to assuming a ﬂat population prior on
χp because our injections are distributed uniformly). We

of the χp posterior distribution as a function of the SNR
for the six injections described in Sec. III A. Blue and red
scatter points refer to the heuristic and averaged χp deﬁnition,
respectively. The dotted lines represent the values of the
skewness and kurtosis calculated from the priors.

This argument is further explored in Fig. 3, where we
show the skewness and kurtosis for the same six injections
presented in Fig. 2. These quantities are related to the
third and fourth moments of the distribution and describe
the departure from Gaussianity; both are zero for normally
distributed data, with the skewness quantifying the left-
right asymmetry and the kurtosis quantifying the weight
of the tails [51]. Figure 3 shows that both skewness and
kurtosis of the averaged χp are approximately distributed
around 0. On the other hand, the skewness (kurtosis) of
the heuristic χp strongly increases (decreases) with the
SNR. This indicate that (i) the heuristic χp posteriors
have a thinner tails compared a normal distribution and
that (ii) their left tail is more pronounced compared to the
right tail. These features can be taken as a quantiﬁcation
of the artiﬁcial cutoﬀ at χp = 1, an assumption that
is naturally relaxed when considering the averaged χp
estimator.

7.01% of false negatives, and 44.98% of true positives.

From Fig. 4, the signals with higher SNR lie closer to the
injected values and present thinner posterior distributions,
as expected. In the true negative region, the recovered
posteriors are distributed around the true value without
evident systematic trends. On the other hand, when χp >
1, the recovered posteriors systematically underestimate
the true value. While this is, in general, true for most
systems, in a few cases this is suﬃcient to cause false
negatives.

One can further quantify this behavior using the ad-

justed posterior quantile

are shown in Fig. 5. We ﬁnd a strong decreasing trend of
Q for increasing values of χp, which becomes particularly
evident in the χp > 1 region. Our analysis indicates that,
in general, statistical errors cause an underestimate of
χp whenever χp > 1. In other words, given a waveform
model, sources with two-spin precession require larger
SNR for accurate measurement.

With a completeness of 86.5% and a contamination of
1.2%, our results are, overall, are extremely encouraging.1
The broader conclusion is that sources with χp > 1 and
suﬃciently high SNR ρ (cid:38) 20 in O4 can, in principle, be
correctly identiﬁed as aﬀected by two precessing spins.

Impact of the prior

≈

Our parameter-space exploration highlights a generic
tendency to underestimate precession eﬀects whenever
χp > 1. The steep feature at χp
1 shown in Fig. 1
strongly suggests that this statistical bias is driven by
the employed prior. To verify this, we select two injec-
tions among the 100 we have just presented with pos-
1, i.e. where the displacement
terior quantile Q
between the injected and recovered values of χp is maxi-
mized. More speciﬁcally, the two systems we consider have

instead take a volumetric prior on the spins. The latter
choice enhances the prior weight assigned to conﬁgura-
tions with large spins (c.f. Fig. 1). For the injection with

−0.16 with the
standard prior and χp = 0.38+0.14
−0.16 with the volumetric
prior. This example shows that simply changing the prior
to an alternative that is equally well motivated —why
should vectors like the spins be distributed uniformly in
magnitude instead of volume?— can signiﬁcantly mitigate
the inferred bias. In this case, the posterior quantile in-
creases from Q =
0.75. The improvement
is less evident, but still present, for the injection with
χp = 1.92, where a volumetric prior yields χp = 1.28+0.37

Sec. III A, the posterior tends toward the true values for

true value remaining outside the 90% credible interval.

D. Waveform systematics

All the analyses illustrated so far were performed using
the same waveform model for both injection and recovery
and, therefore, do not capture systematic errors due to
any mismodeling of the signal. Binaries with prominent
spin eﬀects are harder to model, implying that the χp > 1
region we are interested in is also where discrepancies

The left (right) panels show results for a source injected with χp = 0.43 and M = 131.1M(cid:12) (χp = 1.57 and M = 130.8M(cid:12))
The top panels show results obtained with the two phenomenological models IMRPhenomXPHM (“PhenX”) for χp = 0.43
(ρ = 107.3) and for χp = 1.57 (ρ = 90.3) and IMRPhenomTPHM (“PhenT”) for χp = 0.43 (ρ = 93.6) and χp = 1.57 (ρ = 81.7).
The bottom panels show results obtained in combination with the numerical-relativity surrogate model NRSur7dq4 (“NRSur”)
for χp = 0.43 (ρ = 100.2) and for χp = 1.57 (ρ = 75.6). For each case, the label reported before (after) the hyphen in the legend
refers to the waveform model used at the injection (recovery) stage. The injected values are indicated with black vertical lines.
Medians and 90% credible interval of the posterior distribution are indicated with dashed lines and shaded areas, respectively.

between diﬀerent approximants are more likely to appear.
Figure 7 and Table I illustrate the posterior distribution
of the averaged χp parameter when diﬀerent models are
used in injection and recovery. We test various combina-
tions of the IMRPhenomXPHM [48], IMRPhenomT-
PHM [49], and NRSur7dq4 [50] waveform models. We
concentrate on two systems selected from the 100 injec-
tions presented in Sec. III B. In particular, we consider
one source with χp = 1.57 characterized by two promi-
nently precessing spins as well as a control case with
χp = 0.43. The SNRs computed using IMRPhenomX-
PHM are ρ = 90.3 and ρ = 107.3, respectively. Both
sources have suﬃciently large detector-frame total masses
M (cid:38) 125M(cid:12) such that the signal is short enough to be
simulated with NRSur7dq4. The cases where the signal
is injected with NRSur7dq4 are arguably more realistic
as this model is proven to be more accurate, i.e., closer to
numerical-relativity simulations [50], though the model
does require extrapolation at the low-q and high-χ1,2
edges of the parameter space we consider. For both the

analyzed cases, the posteriors are relatively well centered
on the true values whenever the injection and recovery
are performed with the same waveform model.

The most evident feature from Fig. 7 is that systematic
biases increase dramatically for higher values of χp. This
statement holds even though our analyzed low-χp (high-
χp) case has a higher (smaller) SNR and should thus be
more (less) susceptible to waveform systematics.

For the χp = 0.43 source (left panels in Fig. 7), the
injected value lies inside the 90% credible interval of
the posterior for most the waveform combinations we
tested. The only exception is the case where we inject with
the NRSur7dq4 and recover with IMRPhenomXPHM.
This run shows the largest quantile Q =
0.93 which
tentatively suggests a lower accuracy of that model to
spin precession, at least for this speciﬁc set of parameters.
This conclusion is reinforced by our results obtained when
the source is generated with IMRPhenomTPHM but
recovered with IMRPhenomXPHM: the injected value
is barely inside the 90% credible interval with posterior

For the second case studied here with χp = 1.57 (right
panels in Fig. 7), waveform systematics are severe. All
waveform combinations where we inject and recover with
diﬀerent models return posterior distributions that are in-
consistent with the true value at extremely high conﬁdence
(so high that we cannot meaningfully quantify it with the
samples at our disposal). The worst cases appears to be
those when we recover with IMRPhenomXPHM, which
produce a χp posterior that is entirely below unity.

While a more complete investigation on waveform sys-
tematics is beyond the scope of this work, the selected
cases studied here tentatively indicate that current state-
of-the-art approximants struggle at providing a consistent
modeling of the signal in the χp > 1 region, to a level that
will be signiﬁcant for the heavy, loud sources expected in
O4. The discrepancies between the waveform models in
the high-precession limit are potentially expected due to
the diﬀerences in the prescriptions for the spin dynamics
between the models. In IMRPhenomXPHM, the preces-
sion angles are calculated by applying the stationary phase
approximation to the multi-timescale scale analysis of the
precession equations [33, 53]. The prescription is then
artiﬁcially extended through the merger and ringdown
beyond its regime of validity. In IMRPhenomTPHM,
the precession angles are calculated by direct integration
of the equations of motion, coupled to a semi-analytical
approximation for the merger-ringdown that relies on an
angular velocity determined by the quasinormal mode
frequencies of the remnant BH [54].

Waveform developers are actively working toward cal-
ibrating PN-based waveform models using numerical-
relativity simulations with precessing spins (e.g., [55]),
which will hopefully alleviate the systematic deviations

reported here. It is also important to stress that, for this
exercise, we had to select sources with high-enough mass
such that the signal is fully covered by NRSur7dq4, but
these are also the systems where the precession signature
is expected to be weaker. This is because precession cycles
are contained in the low-frequency part of the signal that
gradually falls out of band as the total mass increases.

On a more positive note, the conclusion that emerges
here is that waveform systematic do not produce false
positive:
if a future observation will deliver χp > 1 at
high conﬁdence, it appears safe to claim that the BH
binary had two precessing spin.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

If an incoming LIGO/Virgo source is composed of merg-
ing BHs with two precessing spins, will we able to tell?
In this paper we have provided a statistical assessment of
this question using a large set of software injections.

For dimensionality reduction and interpretation pur-
poses, it is useful to have a single parameter that can
capture the eﬀect of precession in GW data. We employ
a recent generalization [28] of the eﬀective precessing spin
χp [29]. Unlike its predecessor, the augmented formula-
tion does not assume that one of the two spin dominates
the dynamics. In particular, the region of the parameter
space 1 < χp
2 is exclusive to binaries with two pre-
cessing spins. Because spin-spin couplings in GW data
provide a weak contribution to the waveform, measuring
source with χp > 1 also requires sensitive detectors. While
such a detection has not occurred in current data [28, 30],
our software injections at O4 sensitivity demonstrate that
this goal is well within our reach.

≤

In this paper we have concentrated solely on inference
of precession with the χp estimator. With the BH bi-
nary parameter space spanning 15 dimensions, our large
set of injections naturally contains much more informa-
tion that could potentially be extracted (including, but
not limited to, diﬀerent spin precession estimators, cor-
relation between the eﬀective spins and other binary pa-
rameters, and the vector spin components themselves).
In order to facilitate further exploitation, our posterior
chains are made publicly available in their entirety at
github.com/ViolaDeRenzis/twoprecessingspins [56]. The
total computational budget to collect these data amounts
to about half a million CPU hours.

It is important to stress that the occurrence of two pre-
cessing spins is a necessary, but not suﬃcient, condition to
obtain values χp > 1, (i.e., being in this region implies the
source has two precessing spins, but not vice versa). Such
large values of χp require a considerable ﬁne-tuning of the
binary’s intrinsic parameters (large spin magnitudes, mass
ratios close to unity, spins coplanar with the orbit and
aligned with each other). This makes our assessment very
conservative and lets us identify sources with smoking-
gun evidence of two-spin precession. As the detectors’
sensitivities increase and one moves beyond eﬀective-spin

10

parameterizations, inference on the higher-dimensional
spin parameter space will hopefully allow us to relax such
conservative assumptions.

Our large-scale injection study shows that a BH binary
with two prominently precessing spins at suﬃciently high
SNR can be generically identiﬁed as such. We also pointed
out how the departure from Gaussiany of the χp distri-
bution can be a precious indicator of the suboptimality
of the adopted indicator. At the same time, prior eﬀects
and waveform systematics introduce some interpretation
issues that need to be further explored.

Of all the software injections we performed with diﬀer-
ent source parameters and waveform models, we did not
detect a single conﬁdent false positive (i.e., a source with
χp < 1 which is erroneously recovered as having χp > 1).
Our study strongly indicates that, should a conﬁdent de-
tection with χp > 1 be made in O4, this would provide a

conservative and safe claim of the ﬁrst observation of a
merging BH binary with two precessing spins.
