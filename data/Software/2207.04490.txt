Abstract 
Background and Objectives: A simple, adaptive, and efficient method to detect the beginning of the left 
ventricular  ejection  in  Impedance  Cardiogram  (ICG)  or  the  so-called  B-point  is  presented.  From 
implementation  perspective  this  method  is  designed  in  time  domain  and  could  be  exploited  for  real-
time implementation. 
Methods: The core of the new method is transformation by weighted time window of an ICG segment 
preceding  the  maximal  ICG  peak  (the  C-point)  aiming  at  the  B-point  enhancement.  The  resulting 
Modified  B-point  (MB-point)  is  then  easily  delineated.  To evaluate  the  proposed  workflow  for  B-point 
detection based solely on ICG signal, the dataset comprising 20 healthy participants and 21065 B-points 
are manually annotated and openly shared with the software code. To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the  largest  reported  and  shared  ICG  dataset  for  delineation.  Detector  performance  was  evaluated  on 
two recorded segments with less and more distinct noises, as well as on an available dataset from the 
internet comprising ICG recorded in another set of 24 healthy subjects. 
Results: The results showed that the method was superior when the tolerance for B-point detection was 
set to ±150 ms in all cases and for both datasets (>99.4%). 
Conclusions:  In  conclusion,  proposed  approach  based  on  the  weighted  time  windows  presents  a 
promising technique for reliable ICG delineation and even for further customization for labeling of other 
biomedical signals such as electrocardiogram and photopletismogram.

1 Introduction  

Impedance  Cardiography  (ICG)  is  a  cost-effective,  simple,  portable,  and  noninvasive  technique 
for monitoring continuous mechanical activity of cardiovascular system that can be used for assessment 
of  heart  abnormalities.  The  technique  comprises  electrical  stimulator  that  injects  alternating  current  I 
with high frequency (20 kHz – 100 kHz) and low amplitude (1 mA – 5 mA) through a pair of stimulating 
electrodes  and  system  for  acquisition  of  the  resulting  voltage  U  with  sensing  inner  pair  of  surface 
electrodes. Digitized pulsating signal is proportional to the time-varying bioimpedance (ΔU = ΔZI) across 
the thorax. Commonly, ΔZ is differentiated and the negative first derivative dZ/dt  ΔZ/Δt in [Ω/s] (rate 
of biompedance change) is known as ICG signal. ICG resembles bioimpedance thorax variation caused by 
the changes in the blood volume and flow during cardiac cycle, airflow in the lungs, and lung perfusion. 
[1-11] 

ICG is used to obtain Cardiac Output (CO), Stroke Volume (SV), generate impedance distribution 
of  tissue,  diagnose  heart  failure  or  its  cause,  assess  the  severity  of  heart  attack,  measure  total  body 
water,  assess  the  effect  of  physical  exercises,  evaluate  sleep  disorders,  determine  the  effects  of 
medications  on  cardiovascular  system,  predict  valvular  heart  diseases,  enable  blood  flow  monitoring 
during anesthesia, observe hemodynamics in hemodialysis, etc. Besides, it  is used to estimate optimal 
pacemaker settings, to model volume conductor, and in biometric applications. [1-6, 12-14] 

Though it was popularized in 1990s for assessment of systolic time intervals and CO [1], ICG was 
introduced back in 1932 year by Atzler and Lehmann [15-16]. In years to come, ICG processing methods 
focused  on  artifact  suppression,  fiducial  points  detection,  and  feature  extraction  were  developed  and 
explored.  Despite  the  outstanding  progress,  existing  methods  are  still  very  limited  and  prevent  wider 
ICG adoption and standardization [1, 4]. Unlike electrocardiogram (ECG), the morphology of ICG is less 
stationary, making ICG delineation the  most  challenging part of the analysis. Non-stationary  nature of 
ICG  is  likely  caused  by  (1)  artifacts  originating  from  respiration,  motion,  and  from  the  poor  electrode 
contacts, and (2) natural ICG variation across subjects and across beat to beat intervals [1, 4, 12]. This 
subsequently  decelerates  the  application  of  automatic  workflows,  as  well  as  error-free  detection  of 
cardiovascular indices [4, 6, 17]. 

Characteristic points of ICG are A-, B-, C- (sometimes denoted as E-point or (dZ/dt)max), X-, and 
O-points. The most prominent C-point is related to the ventricular blood injection and associated with 
the peak in the aortic blood velocity i.e., ventricular contraction. Contrary to the C-point, the B-point is 
less distinct. B-point is defined as the notch just before the C-point occurring at the onset of the final ICG 
rapid  upslope.  Commonly,  B-point  is  used  to  determine  the  onset  of  left  ventricular  ejection  and 
matches the beginning of the systole. [1, 3-6, 9-12, 17-18] 

The most demanding part of ICG delineation is the B-point detection, mainly as B-point is crucial 
for reliable and accurate  calculation of electromechanical systole intervals such as Pre-Ejection  Period 
(PEP) and Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET). PEP is defined as the interval between Q-wave in ECG 
and  B-point,  while  LVET  presents  distance  between  B-  and  X-points  in  ICG.  Particularly  important  for 
psychophysiology studies is PEP interval as it relates to the contractile force of the left ventricle, while 
LVET is required for SV and CO computation. [1-2, 4-5, 11] 

There is no widely accepted standard for B-point location [5]. Current state-of-the-art methods 
for B-point detection are based on wavelet decomposition, application of higher order derivatives, and 

2 

 
on R-peak detection in simultaneously recorded ECG [4]. Commonly, these methods are computationally 
demanding  and  require  referent  ECG  recording  for  accurate  delineation  which  prevents  real-time 
monitoring  applications  [9].  The  proposed  approach  does  not  rely  on  the  simultaneously  recorded 
referent ECG signal for ICG delineation albeit it is frequently applied approach [1-3, 6]. We advocate for 
a new weighted time window-based method to detect B-point with the reference to the C-point [2, 4] as 
we  aim  at  simple  and  efficient  single  signal  recordings.  At  the  same  time,  we  propose  a  beat-to-beat 
localization of B-point as in [9]. This is not a painless approach as the straight thinking strategy deploys 
time  domain  filtering  i.e.,  ensemble  averaging  to  remove  artifacts,  as  well  as  to  provide  a  rigorously 
reliable measures of SV and CO [11]. 

The  new  method  is  inspired  by  the  compelling  review  in  [1]  where  Authors  advocated  for 
boosting the B-point that corresponds to the highest increase in the rising slope before C-point. Rather 
than  employing  the  second  or  higher  derivatives  [1],  which  are  fairly  sensitive  to  artifacts  and 
measurement  noises,  we  propose  a  weighted  scaling  of  the  upward  trend  preceding  the  C-point  to 
enhance  the  B-point.  We  aim  to  develop  a  simple  and  elegant  solution  based  on  the  weighted  time 
window scaling for B-peak detection. 

2 Methods and Materials 

For data  analysis we use  RStudio development environment (Rstudio  Inc., Boston, USA)  and  R 
programming language v4.1.2 [19] with the following packages: (1) dplyr [20], (2) signal [21], (3) ggplot2 
[22],  and  (4)  pracma  [23]  from  the  CRAN  (The  Comprehensive  R  Archive  Network).  The  analysis  was 
performed on the sample comprising 20 university students (16 females) with no known cardio-vascular 
disorders (age of 20.80±4.82 years). ICG data are randomly selected from a larger dataset [24-25]. The 
primary goal of the original large-scale study was to investigate audio-evoked emotions by physiological 
measurements.  All  participants  signed  Informed  Consents  in  accordance  with  the  Helsinki  Declaration 
and  the  Institutional  Review  Board  from  the  Department  of  Psychology  at  the  University  of  Belgrade 
approved the study (No. 2018-19). 

2.1 Measurement Protocol 

For the first two minutes of the recording subjects were instructed to relax in a sitting position 
(baseline recording). Later, participants were engaged in emotionally induced task. At the end, a post-
manipulation period took part. Subjects were not completely restricted from movements after baseline 
recording.  Therefore,  we  separately  analyzed  baseline  and  the  complete  ICG  recording  to  compare 
results of B-point detector with and without movement artifacts. 

ICG  data  were  recorded  with  BIOPAC  MP160  device  and  AcqKnowledge  software  (Biopac 
Systems Inc., Camino Goleta, CA, USA) with sampling frequency of 2000 Hz. Surface Ag/AgCl electrodes 
(Kendall,  Dublin,  Ireland)  for  ICG  stimulation  and  measurement  were  placed  on  the  subjects’  back 
following  the  base  of  neck  and  the  xiphoid  process  as  anatomical  landmarks.  The  distance  between 
stimulation  and  measurement  electrodes  is  kept  constant  at  3  cm  following  BIOPAC  manual.  Injected 
alternating current frequency is set to 100 kHz and current RMS (Root Mean Square) to 5 mA.

2.2 Time Window Scaling Workflow for MB/B-point Detection 

The  proposed  approach  for  transforming  an  ICG  segment  preceding  the  C-point  by  weighted 

time window for B-point enhancement resulting in Modified B-point (MB-point) is given in Fig. 1. 

Figure 1, Sample ICG segment comprising B-point (marked with red circle) preceding the C-point (upper-left panel) with 
weighted time window (lower-left panel) and the resulting modified ICG signal with more distinctive B-point termed Modified 
B-point (MB-point) marked with red circle (right panel). Segment corresponds to ICG in subject IDN18 and to 20th B-point. Peak-
to-peak distance for constructing a weighted window is marked with h, while the beginning and end of the scaling window are 
marked with tstart and tstop. Parameter α defines a constant scale for constructing weighted time window. 

The processing workflow for B-point transformation with weighted time window into MB-point 
and  for  MB/B-point  detection  is  presented  in  Fig.  2.  ICG  signal  is  filtered  with  3rd  order  band  pass 
Butterworth  filter  with  cutoff  frequencies  of  0.5  Hz  and  50  Hz  (Fig.  2)  to  remove  noise.  Zero-phase 
filtering  in  forward  and  backward  directions  is  applied  to  compensate  for  phase  distortion  [7].  After 
preprocessing,  C-points  locations  are  detected  as  local  extremes  with  simple  thresholding  method:  C-
points are determined as local maxima with minimal peak distance of 350 ms and with threshold that 
equals 80% of standard deviation of ICG signal. The threshold is selected empirically, while the minimal 
peak distance corresponds to pulse rate of 171.4 beats per minute (bpm). 

Then,  we  construct  adaptive  weighted  time  window  and  apply  it  to  the  ICG  segment 
incorporating  250  ms  long  interval  preceding  the  C-point  (upper-left  panel  in  Fig.  1).  The  segregated 
segment  is  afterwards  shifted  so  that  the  minimal  value  equals  zero.  Weighted  time  window  is 
constructed of negative linear slope from minimal to maximal value of ICG segment. Remaining values 
were populated with –α (α = 0.1) scale that is set by error and trial with aim to diminish values around B-

point. Peak-to-peak of the resulting scaling window is  h +  α  where  h  presents the  difference between 
maximal and minimal amplitude. 

Figure 2, Block diagram of processing workflow for MB/B-point detection from ICG signal by weighted time window method. If 
scaling window fails to detect two peaks on the resulting window, the B-point is determined as the point in [-ε, ε] (ε > 0 is a 
small value) in non-weighted ICG segment. Otherwise Modified B-point (MB-point) location is detected as minimum between 
the two distinctive peaks in transformed ICG. 

Next,  the  scaling  was  performed  and  the  expected  resulting  waveform  is  shown  on  the  right 
panel in Fig. 1. MB-point is located between two local maxima on a transformed ICG segment. To locate 
MB-point,  we  firstly  detect  the  two  peaks  of  a  squared  and  scaled  ICG  segment  with  the  following 
criteria:  (1)  minimal  peak  distance  is  set  to  50  ms,  (2)  threshold  equals  maximal  value  of  current 
segment divided with 2000, and (3)  the number of  identified  peaks  following the  first and the second 
criteria  should  equal  two.  Criteria  for  the  peak  detector  applied  on  a  transformed  ICG  segment  are 
established empirically and inspired partly by the well-known Pan-Tompkins real-time QRS detector [2-3, 
26].  In  the  event  that  two  peaks  are  detected  MB-point  is  located  as  minimum  between  them. 
Otherwise,  B-point  is  located  in  [–  ε, ε].  We  were  inspired by approaches  in [1,  4-5] to  define B-point 
location in cases when proposed new algorithm could not distinguish the B-point position. The number 
of missed  MB-point  detections that actually correspond to the alternate B-point  lineation  is reported. 
The R code with data in 20 healthy subjects is available in [27].

2.3 Performance Metrics for the MB/B-point Detector 

For  identifying  manual  annotations  GNU  Octave  v5.2.0  was  used  [28].  Firstly,  ICG  signal  is 
filtered  and  C-points  are  detected  in  the  same  manner  as  shown  in  Fig.  2  and  explained  previously. 
Secondly, ICG segments preceding C-point location to 0.5 s after the current C-point location are plotted 
without marked C-points for proper visibility of B-point incisura. Manual B-points labeling is performed 
by  a  moving  cursor  by  the  first  Author  blinded  for  the  automatic  B-point  locations  as  in  [10].  The 
procedure was repeated. Lastly, locations of both C- and B-points are saved. B-point is detected for all 
segments and the judgment for its visual detection is based on the presence of rapid upstroke toward C-
point  [2].  Additional  selective  manual  inspection  of  C-point  location  is  performed  with  satisfactory 
result.  The  number  of  manually  detected  peaks  for  each  subject  is  reported.  GNU  Octave  code  for 
manual  annotation  and  saved  annotations  are  freely  available  in  [27].  To  ensure  well  grounded 
comparison, new method was applied on the available data from [2, 29] with the application of R.matlab 
library for importing data [30]. 

For assessment of detector performance, we calculate Accuracy (Acc) as the number of properly 
detected B-points within tolerance ranges, Sensitivity (Se), Positive Predictivity (PP), Detected Error (DE), 
and mean error (me) with standard deviation (sd) following previously reported metrics [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 
29].  Moreover,  we  report  comparison  with  other  studies  and  number  of  ICG  cycles,  as  well  as  the 
subjects (healthy and/or patients). Manual B-points are used for quantitative evaluation as ground truth 
following  [2,  4,  6].  Performance  metrics  in  percents  (Se,  PP,  and  DE)  are  calculated  according  to  the 
following relations: 

Se = 100 × TP/(TP+FD) 
PP = 100 × TP/(TP+MD)   
DE = 100 × (FD+MD)/(TP+FD) 

(1) 
(2) 
(3) 

FD stands for Failed Detection, MD for Missed Detection (detection of a false point), and TP for number 
of True Points detected. We adopted tolerances of ±30 ms and of ±150 ms from the manually annotated 
point [2, 10]. 

3 Results 

In Tables 1-2, the evaluation metrics for MB/B-point detection in all subjects are given for the 
complete measurement and for the baseline recording, respectively. PP and Se were not reported as PP 
equals 100%, while Se is identical to Acc. 

In  Table  3,  comparison  of  the  proposed  method  for  MB/B-point  detection  with  previously 
published  results  is  presented.  In  Fig.  3  sample  segments  for  three  ICGs  with  different  detection 
accuracy  (IDN18  with  Acc150  =  100%  and  Acc30  =  94.90%,  IDN8  with  Acc150  =  100%  and  Acc30  = 
80.50%, and IDN12 with Acc150 = 100% and Acc30 = 81.46%) are presented.

4 Discussion 

Accuracies for MB/B-point detection were higher in cases of baseline ICG recording (Tables 1-2). 
This is not a surprise as B-point delineation can be sensitive to noise [2]. Expectedly, new detector is also 
sensitive  to  the  tolerance.  Illustration  of  the  annotated  and  located  MB/B-points  in  Fig.  3  shows 
dependencies of proposed peak detector in relation to ICG morphology as reported previously [1, 7, 17]. 
It should be stated that manual annotation could be erroneous, which is likely the case for the last B-
point  in  IDN12  (Fig.  3).  Despite  the  fact  that  manual  annotation  is  common  for  assessment  ICG  peak 
detectors in literature [2, 4, 10, 29] it may be subjective for non-distinctive B-points [4]. This probably 
affected  the  detection  accuracy  to  some  extent  as  well.  Even  with  all  influences,  average  accuracy  of 
99.41% for ±150 ms tolerance for complete recording presents satisfactory and superior result. 

Missed detections varied a lot: from <1% for IDN3 to ~70% for IDN6 (Table 1). Similar is seen in 
Table  2.  When  we  compare  the  sums  of  missed  MB-points  and  overall  number  of  annotated  peaks  it 
appears that alternate B-point detection took part in 12.16% and 11.76% for the complete and baseline 
recording,  respectively.  This  is  not  an  outstanding  difference  having  in  mind  variable  noise  influence. 
Thus,  we  may  hypothesize  that  this  similar  percent  of  missed  MB-point  detections  originates  rather 
from the ICG morphology than from the artifacts. Interestingly, in [6] Authors obtained similar results as 
their accuracy was not vastly influenced by noise. An exact comparison with other algorithms cannot be 
made, but missing B-points were reported to be more than 10% in [17], which is indeed in line with our 
results. 

In general, the comparison with existing methods should be taken with a pinch of salt due to the 
different approaches in B-point delineation, divergent data, and a variety of validation metrics [2, 10] as 
can be seen for comparison with other methods in Table 3. Still, we summarize results from literature to 
compare the  performance of new algorithm  including evaluation of new method  for another  datasets 
(Table  3).  Detection  accuracies  and  errors  showed  that  the  proposed  method  reaches  superior  or  as 
good as results in comparison to the existing detectors (Table 3). PP is without any due the most high-
ranking parameter of the proposed method. Partly this is result of the MB-point detector dependence 
on the C-point lineation and partly it is related to the alternate approach for B-point detection in cases 
transformed ICG segment does not contain MB-point (Fig. 2). 

The  results  presented  in  brackets  for  data  from  [2,  29]  in  Table  3  are  given  without  three 
recordings as in one case we reached Acc of 0% and hypothesized that the annotations were not saved 
uniformly.  Therefore,  results  from  remaining  42  cases  corresponding  to  20  healthy  subjects  are 
presented.  New  detector  reaches  superior  results  in  cases  of  ±150  ms  tolerance  and  with  three 
discharged  recordings.  Even  when  these  recordings  are  included,  the  results  of  Acc  for  new  method 
(96.48%) are comparable with those in [2, 29] (99.04%). The presented dataset in this manuscript is by 
far  the  largest  one  (Table  3).  However,  further  advancement  of  the  new  MB/B-point  detector 
particularly for tolerance of ±30 ms will be welcome. 

4.1 Limitations of the Study 

We have recognized the following limitations: 
1.  Future evaluation of the proposed method could be performed in patients [6, 10]. 

9 

 
 
2.  We did not use available signal labeler [31]. The comparison of manual annotation procedures 

exceeds the scope of the manuscript. 

3.  B-point pattern recognition was not performed and we did not use machine learning algorithms 
for  such  purpose  [4,  17].  Both  techniques  are  very  promising  and  could  be  combined  in  the 
future. 

4.  We  did  not  implement  signal  quality  assessment  to  indicate  low  quality  regions  [12].  Future 

approach could employ such strategy for exact reasoning on method robustness. 

5.  We  did  not  introduce  preprocessing  adaptation  and  optimization.  One  may  utilize  B-point 
detectors by excellent results of adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter for noise elimination in ICG [2-3] 
or in ECG [32-33]. 

5 Conclusions 

Transforming ICG with weighted time windows presents a promising technique for MB/B-point 
detection.  The  proposed  workflow  could  be  utilized  for  other  biosignals  such  as  dicrotic  notch  of  the 
pulse waveform in photopletismogram (PPG) as suggested in [7] or in ECG. We contribute to the body of 
knowledge in the following ways: 

1)  We give a detailed workflow for automatic B-point detection that proved superior in PP and in 

accuracy for tolerance of ±150 ms. 

2)  Open  dataset  in  20  university  students  comprising  ECG,  thoracic  impedance  (ΔZ),  and  ICG  is 
available  [27].  Besides,  we  publicly  share  manually  annotated  B-points  and  GNU  Octave  for 
manual labeling, as well as R code for B-point detection [27].
