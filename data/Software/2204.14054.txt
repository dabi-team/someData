Abstract:  Using the ORCA 5.0.2 software package we have simulated for a first  time the  full 
tensors  nJKL  (K,L=X,Y,Z),  describing  n-bond  J-coupling  of  nuclear  spins  13C  in  H-terminated 
diamond-like  clusters  C10H16  (adamantane)  and    C35H36  as  well  as  in  the  cluster  C33[NV-]H36 
hosting the negatively charged NV- center. We found that, in addition to usually considered iso-
tropic scalar  nJ-coupling constant the anisotropic contributions to the  nJ-coupling tensor are es-

sential. We have also shown that the presence of the NV center affects the J-coupling character-
istics, especially in the case of 13C-13C pairs located near the vacancy of the NV center.  

Keywords:  Solid-State  NMR,  JC-C-coupling  tensor,  H-terminated  diamond  cluster,  NV  center,

1.  Introduction 

In the past decade there was rapid progress in development of quantum magnetic sensing 

technologies based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond (see, e.g. [1,2] for recent 

reviews). Magnetometer based on single NV center can have nanometer-scale spatial resolution 
and exceptional sensitivity (up to ~Hz) allowing to detect target single  13C nuclear spins or cou-
pled 13C-13C pairs located within the diamond which can be used as long-lived quantum memory 

[3]. Moreover, NV-based magnetometer allows to distinguish  non-equivalent nuclear spins (by 

their  chemical  shifts)  of  molecules  located  at  diamond  surface  [4],  thus  enabling  new  exciting 

research  area  of  single-spin  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  for  investigating  important  is-

 
 
 
 
 
sues ranging from  determination of molecular structures of inorganic/biological  compounds up 

to medical imaging for therapeutic matters. In these respects, predicting of high-resolution NMR 

characteristics for studied spin systems is essential. Among them, those of indirect nuclear spin–

spin  coupling  (the  J-coupling),  that  arise  due  to  second-order  hyperfine  interactions  with  elec-
trons from chemical bond connecting nuclei, are important. Generally, a second-rank tensor nJKL 

(K,L=X,Y,Z) is required to fully describe J-coupling between two nuclei [5]. However, up to the 

recent  time  most  high-resolution  NMR  experiments  were  focused  on  measuring  only  isotropic 
scalar constant nJiso=Sp nJKL/3 because the anisotropic parts of the J-tensor were averaged out to 

zero by fast molecular motion in solution-state NMR or fast magic-angle spinning (MAS) in sol-

id-state experiments [6-8]. Meanwhile, in the case of crystalline solids, the constituent atoms are 

located in certain order determined by the crystal structure so that many important NMR interac-

tions are orientation dependent and the  information about anisotropic NMR interaction tensors 
became essential [5,8]. In particular, recently both the symmetric  1Jiso=(1JZZ+1JXX+1JYY)/3 (=70 
Hz) and the asymmetric Δ1J= 1JZZ-(1JXX+1JYY)/2 (=90 Hz) parts of the J-coupling tensor 1JKL for 
the nearest-neighbor (N-N) 29Si nuclear spins have been determined in the single-crystal silicon 

by measuring at four different crystallographic orientations relative to the applied magnetic field 
the NMR lineshapes which are sensitive to the value of Δ1J. In diamond with 13C nuclear spins, 

which is of main interest here, analogous experiment was done many years ago [10] but due to 

low sensitivity any J-coupling effects have not been studied there. Also, as far as we know, there 

were no theoretical works on the quantum-chemical calculation of the J-coupling characteristics 
of 13C nuclear spins in diamond. To fill this gap, here we are presenting for a first time the results 
of simulation of full tensors JKL (K,L=X,Y,Z) describing the J-couplings of nuclear spins  13C in 

small H-terminated diamond clusters as well as in the cluster hosting the NV- color center. 

2.  Methods and Materials  

In principle, theoretical foundations of J-coupling are well-established [11-14] and there 

has  been  considerable  progress  in  calculating  the  J-coupling  characteristics  for  many  simple 
molecules  (see,  e.g.  [12,15-17])  including  13C-13C  pairs  [12,16-19].  However,  previously  most 

software packages were limited by calculation of the scalar J-coupling constants. Only recently 

has it become possible to calculate full J-coupling tensors. Here we have used for the purpose the 

lastest  version  5.0.2  of  the  ORCA  package.  To  model  diamond  crystal  we  used  H-terminated 

carbon  clusters.  First,  in  order  to  test  the  opportunities  of  the  package,  we  calculated  the  J-
tensors for all possible pairs  13C-13C in the diamond-like adamantane molecule C10H16 (see Fig. 
1a),  for  which  the  isotropic  J-coupling  constants  1Jiso  for  N-N  nuclear  spins  13C  was 

experimentally measured to be 31.4±0.5 Hz [20]. Having obtained the value ~29.9 Hz for them 

 
(see  below  Fig.  2a)  that  is  quite  close  to  the  above  experimental  one,  we  performed  similar 

calculations for the H-terminated carbon cluster C35H36 (Fig 1b), as well as for the similar cluster 
C33[NV-]H36  hosting  the  NV  color  center  (Fig.  1c).  It  should  be  noted  that  the  choice  of  such 

small  clusters  was  due  to  the  fact  that,  as  is  known  [14-16], the  calculations  of  the  J-coupling 

characteristics are very computationally demanding for even modest size molecules.

atoms  Ci  are shown in  grey, passivating H-atoms  - in  yellow, nitrogen atom  N in  Fig. 1c  –  in

We have optimized the cluster geometry using the ORCA 5.0.2 software package with 

the B3LYP/def2/J/RIJCOSX level of theory and then simulated the n-bond J-coupling tensors 
nJKL for all possible 13C-13C pairs in the clusters using B3LYP/TZVPP/AUTOAUX/decontract 

level of theory. The package returns matrices describing the diamagnetic, paramagnetic, Fermi-
contact, spin-dipolar and spin-dipolar/Fermi contact cross terms contributions to the total nJKL 

tensor in the coordinate systems indicated in the Figure 1. Using them and taking into account 
the known coordinates of carbon atoms belonging to some definite 13C-13C pair in the cluster, 

one can find respective J-coupling matrices in the other coordinate system. In particular, for 
neighboring nuclear spins 13C, separated by a single bond in diamond (~1.54 Å), total 1JKL ma-

trix becomes diagonal with JXX ≈ JYY  in the coordinate system in which the Z-axis is directed 

along this bond [9]. In this case it is conventional to describe an axial J-coupling tensor in terms 
of two parameters: the scalar constant 1Jiso and the asymmetric part Δ1J. Since the magnitude of 

the J-coupling decreases rapidly with bond order, we will mainly consider here only such N-N 

nuclear spins.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Results and discussion 

In the case of adamantane we first calculated the isotropic J-coupling constants nJiso for 

all possible pairs Ci-Cj with the numbers i and j shown in the Fig. 1a. The results of calculations 

are shown in the Fig. 2a as a bar graph. In the molecule there are 12 pairs (C1-C2, C1-C4, C1-

C6, C2-C3, C3-C4, C3-C10, C4-C5, C5-C8, C6-C7, C7-C8, C7-C9) wherein carbon atoms are 

nearest-neighbors. For them, the values of the 1Jiso constants were in the range of 29.8 - 29.92 

Hz, i.e. were close to the experimentally measured [20] value of 31.4 Hz. For all these pairs, the 
calculated total matrices nJKL were close to diagonal, since the isotropic Fermi-contact interact-

tion made the main contribution to them. Moreover, taking into account the symmetry of the N-

N Ci-Cj pairs about their midpoint in the transformed coordinate system, in which the Z axis is 

directed along the Ci-Cj bond, it is possible to reduce the J-coupling matrices to their simplest 
diagonal form [9] with 1JXX ≈1JYY . As an example, we considered the C1-C2 pair, in which both 

nuclear spins are located on the X axis (see Figure 1a) so that the transformation of the calculat-

ed matrices to the new coordinate system, where the Z axis is directed along the C1-C2 bond, is 
carried out simply by rotation counterclockwise by 900 around the Y axis. For the C1-C2 pair the 

partial matrices in thus transformed coordinate system are presented below:

One can see from these data the relative contributions of various interactions. They also

is, 
near-diagonal  with 
1JXX(C1,C2)≈1JYY(C1,C2)  so  that  for  this  pair  the  asymmetric  part  of  the  J-coupling  tensor  is 
Δ1J= 1JZZ-(1JXX+1JYY)/2= -11.74 Hz. Similar data can be obtained for other pairs of N-N nuclear 
spins  in  the  adamantane  molecule.  Figure  2a  also  shows  that  the  isotropic  constants  2Jiso  and 

expected 

[9], 

as 

3Jiso for more distant nuclear spins are only few hertz or less. 

The results of similar calculations of isotropic constants nJiso, performed for all possible 
pairs 13C-13C in the clusters C35H36 and C33[NV-]H36 are shown in Figures 2b and 2c, respective-

ly. As one can see from Figure 1b, for the cluster C35H36 we choose the coordinate systems in 

which the origin was taken at the C2 carbon atom and Z axis was directed from C2 to C1 atom. 
In this cluster there are 595 different  13C-13C pairs with 52 of them being N-N carbons. Among 

these N-N pairs 13 ones have their bonds being near-parallel to the chosen Z axis. These bonds 

are shown in red in Figure 1b. For the remaining 39 N-N pairs, shown in blue in Figure 1b, the 

angles  between  their  bonds  and  the  Z  axis  were  approximately  equal  to  the  tetrahedral  angle 
109.470 (or 1800-109.470). Respectively, for the cluster C33[NV-]H36 the origin of the coordinate 

system was taken on the N atom of the NV center and Z axis was coinciding with the NV center 
axis. In this cluster there are 45 N-N 13C-13C pairs with 12 of them having bonds directed near-

parallel to the Z axis. Again, these 12 pairs are shown in red in Figure 1c and the other ones are 
shown in blue. For the cluster C35H36 simulated one-bond constants 1Jiso were in the range 29.8-

30.0 Hz (see also Table 1 below), i.e. very close to those obtained for the admantane molecule. 
Contrary, in the case of the cluster C33[NV-]H36, containing the NV center, there are several pairs 
of N-N 13C atoms, located near the vacancy of the NV center, for which the values of the 1Jiso 

constants are slightly higher (~37.1 Hz) than for the other pairs (~ 31.5-31.8 Hz, see, in particu-

lar, Table 1).  

The  above  data  on  the  isotropic  constants  1Jiso  for  the  clusters  C35H36  and  C33[NV-]H36 
have been obtained from total J-coupling matrices  1JKL calculated for these clusters. Generally, 

as in the case of adamantane, the matrices have diagonal elements being much larger than non-

diagonal ones. It is these diagonal elements that are shown in Figures 3a-c and 3d-f for the

One  can  see  from  Figures  3  and,  especially,  from  Table  1  that  for  the  Ci-Cj  pairs  being  near-
parallel  to  the  Z  axis  the  values  1JXX(Ci,Cj)≈1JYY(Ci,Cj)  are  about  one  and  a  half  times  more 
larger then 1JZZ(Ci,Cj). Moreover, the presence of the negatively charged NV- center in the clus-
ter C33[NV-]H36 , which introduces additional electron density, leads to some increase in the di-
agonal  elements  1JKK  of  the  J-coupling  matrices  for  all  Ci-Cj  pairs  compared  to  the  cluster 
C35H36 . As follows from Table 1, such an increase in the  1JKK values is especially pronounced 

(~9%) for the C4-C7, C5-C10 and C6-C13 pairs, in which the atoms С4,C5 and С6 are the near-

est-neighbors of the vacancy of the NV center and on which the electron density of the center is 

mainly localized [21]. A similar increase in J-coupling takes place for other pairs С4/5/6-Сj, for 
which the corresponding bonds make an angle of ~109.470 with the axis Z of the selected coor-

dinate system.  

Conclusions  

For the first time, the total tensors describing the indirect interaction of 13C nuclear spins in ada-
mantane molecules, H-terminated diamond cluster C35H36, and in the cluster C33[NV-]H36 host-

ing NV centers, have been calculated by quantum chemistry methods. It is shown that the pres-
ence of the NV center leads to a change in characteristics of the indirect interaction of 13C nucle-

ar spins. The results obtained are important for quantum information and sensor applications, in 
particular, for creation of long-lived quantum memory based on singlet-state  13C-13C dimers in 

diamond [3], creation of nanoscale NV-based quantum sensors that ensure the detection of ad-

sorbed molecules/radicals on the surface of nanostructured diamond [4] and the determination of 

their chemical  structure.  Such sensors can be used to  study biological  processes at  the level  of 

individual  cells,  membranes,  nerve  fibers,  targeted  drug  delivery  and  control  of  such  delivery. 

The data obtained can also be useful for studies of NMR in the Zero- to Ultralow-field regime 

[22-25] where precisely the internal spin interactions in their natural environment are dominated. 

 
 
 
An analysis of the dynamics of multispin systems  14NV-13C-13C with the account of both direct 
dipole-dipole interactions of 13C nuclear spins and of their J-coupling, as well as modeling of the 

NMR spectra of such objects, will be presented elsewhere.
