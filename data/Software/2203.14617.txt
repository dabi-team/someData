Abstract. Leveraging a GraphQL-based federated query service that
integrates multiple scholarly communication infrastructures (speciﬁcally,
DataCite, ORCID, ROR, OpenAIRE, Semantic Scholar, Wikidata and
Altmetric), we develop a novel web widget based approach for the pre-
sentation of scholarly knowledge with rich contextual information. We
implement the proposed approach in the Open Research Knowledge
Graph (ORKG) and showcase it on three kinds of widgets. First, we
devise a widget for the ORKG paper view that presents contextual in-
formation about related datasets, software, project information, topics,
and metrics. Second, we extend the ORKG contributor proﬁle view with
contextual information including authored articles, developed software,
linked projects, and research interests. Third, we advance ORKG com-
parison faceted search by introducing contextual facets (e.g. citations).
As a result, the devised approach enables presenting ORKG scholarly
knowledge ﬂexibly enriched with contextual information sourced in a
federated manner from numerous technologically heterogeneous schol-
arly communication infrastructures.

Introduction

Massive (meta)data about digital and physical scholarly artefacts including ar-
ticles, datasets, software, instruments, and samples are made available through
various scholarly communication infrastructures [24, 12, 23]. Individually, current
infrastructures focus on ﬁnding a certain kind of artefact. Lacking the ability to
present information about related artefacts, they are unable to meet complex
user information needs [21]. For instance, if a researcher searches for scholarly
articles she may want information about related datasets, software, projects and
organizations. Obtaining such diverse information with a single request is not
obvious because the information resides with distributed and technologically het-
erogeneous infrastructures. Separate search on infrastructures is, however, time
consuming and laborious [26, 22]. Therefore, federated search is necessary for
eﬃcient and comprehensive content exploration.

Haris et al.

For this purpose, we developed a GraphQL-based federated system [5] that
integrates multiple scholarly communication infrastructures, namely, the Open
Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG)3 [11], DataCite4, and GeoNames5. It sup-
ports executing queries in a federated manner and enables the integrated retrieval
of scholarly information. The main purpose of the federated system is to enable
cross-walking scholarly knowledge and contextual information as well as ﬁlter-
ing at (meta)data granularity. However, the federated system currently has some
limitations: 1) The scope of contextual information is limited to three scholarly
infrastructures; and 2) the system requires queries to be written in GraphQL,
which is untenable in practice.

As the main contribution of the work presented here, we devise a web widget
based approach that retrieves rich contextual information for scholarly knowl-
edge from distributed scholarly communication infrastructures and presents schol-
arly knowledge with rich context in an integrated manner. We demonstrate the
integration of these widgets in ORKG to enrich its various views thus enabling
rapid, comprehensive exploration of scholarly content. The proposed approach
involves the following two main aspects:

1. Extend the GraphQL-based federated system6 to include the DataCite PID
Graph and REST APIs of OpenAIRE7, Semantic Scholar8, Wikidata9 and
Altmetric10 and enable retrieving comprehensive contextual information for
ORKG scholarly knowledge in a federated and integrated manner.

2. Building on the extended federated system, develop diﬀerent web widgets to
enrich scholarly knowledge viewed in ORKG with rich contextual informa-
tion.

We address the following research question: How can we ﬂexibly enrich the
presentation of scholarly knowledge in web based user interfaces with compre-
hensive contextual information published by numerous heterogeneous scholarly
communication infrastructures?

2 Related Work

Scholia [19] is a dynamic user interface that operates on Wikidata’s SPARQL
endpoint and supports users in searching for articles, researcher proﬁles, organi-
zations and publishers. Similarly, BioCarian [25] is a SPARQL endpoint powered
user-friendly interface enabling exploring biological databases. The interface is

enriched with facets that enable better query construction, thus making it easier
for users to ﬁlter data. OSCAR [8] is a platform for searching RDF triples using
a SPARQL endpoint while hiding the complexity of SPARQL, thus making the
search operations easier for users who are not aware of web technologies. Simi-
larly, Elda11 was proposed to access data served via a Linked Data API12. Elda
is a Java implementation of the Linked Data API that allows customization of
API requests for accessing RDF datasets.

Following the Scholix [2] framework, ScholeXplorer13 aggregates metadata
harvested from diﬀerent data sources (in particular, DataCite, Crossref, Ope-
nAIRE) and creates a graph of scholarly entities. As such, the framework sup-
ports users in discovering research articles and related datasets.

Kurteva and Ribaupierre [13] present a user interface that allows casual users
to ﬁnd speciﬁc types of data in the DBpedia knowledge base. The interface also
provides a graphical visualization of retrieved results. Morton et al. [17] present a
framework for querying biomedical knowledge graphs, ranking, and conveniently
exploring the queried results. Several other systems for research data discovery
exist including BioGraph [14], Het.io [10], Wikidata14, Open Knowledge Maps15,
Unpaywall16, Zenodo17, Figshare18, re3data19.

FedX [22] was proposed to execute SPARQL queries on virtually integrated
heterogeneous data sources. The practicability of the proposed framework was
demonstrated by executing some real-world queries on the Linked Open Data
Cloud. BioFed [7] is another federated query processing system that supports
executing queries on a variety of SPARQL endpoints to retrieve life sciences
data. The system integrates 130 SPARQL endpoints and supports retrieving the
provenance information along with the data. The eﬃciency of the system was
demonstrated by executing 10 complex and 10 simple queries, and the results
were compared with FedX in terms of optimization. Another SPARQL-based
federated system was proposed [18], whose main purpose was to retrieve Open
Educational Resources (OERs) published on disparate web platforms. Federated
systems also support searching for personalized information, such as retrieving
information about user proﬁles from diverse sources [1].

The structured comparison of diﬀerent scholarly communication infrastruc-
tures can be found in Haris et al. [6]. As the amount of data on these infras-
tructures is increasing rapidly, it is of utmost importance to enrich scholarly
artefacts with their contextual information. The infrastructures reviewed here
individually provide information about a particular kind of scholarly artefact,
but rarely present the artefacts with rich contextual information. For ORKG

scholarly knowledge as the core artefact, we propose an approach that queries
a range of scholarly communication infrastructures to retrieve and present rich
contextual information.

3 Conceptual Model and its Application

Figure 1 illustrates the conceptual model underpinning our work. In this model,
a federated query service abstracts and uniﬁes access to and retrieval of data
served by arbitrary scholarly communication infrastructures. Here the purpose of
the service is to facilitate the eﬃcient construction of user interface widgets that
enrich the presented information with contextual information. The conceptual
model comprises the following two key aspects:

1. Flexible, on-demand, virtual and federated integration of scholarly communi-
cation infrastructures and straightforward extension of the GraphQL-based
federated query service to serve contextual information required by user in-
terface widgets.

2. Uniform access by means of a single query and data exchange interface to
comprehensive contextual information required to enrich with context arbi-
trary information presented in a user interface.

We apply this conceptual model for scholarly communication infrastruc-
tures, speciﬁcally in developing widgets that enrich scholarly knowledge pre-
sented in the ORKG with comprehensive contextual information sourced in a

Enriching Scholarly Knowledge with Context

federated manner from numerous scholarly communication infrastructures serv-
ing metadata about articles (Crossref and Semantic Scholar), datasets and soft-
ware (DataCite), projects (OpenAIRE), organizations (ROR), contributors (OR-
CID). Speciﬁcally, we develop widgets to enrich scholarly knowledge presented
in ORKG with rich contextual information, in particular for:

1. ORKG paper view : Display contextual information about related datasets,

projects, topics and Altmetrics for the viewed paper.

2. ORKG contributor proﬁle: Display employment history, published artefacts
other than those published on ORKG including articles, datasets, software,
projects in which the contributor was involved, and research topics of interest
to the contributor.

3. ORKG comparisons: Extend the faceted search in ORKG comparisons with
the possibility to ﬁlter the compared studies based on rich contextual meta-
data, e.g., ﬁlter compared studies to include those which are cited more than
a given threshold.

4 The Federated Infrastructures

This section provides a brief introduction to the scholarly communication infras-
tructures currently included for federated data access and presents the federated
query service.

DataCite is a DOI registration service for the persistent identiﬁcation of
scholarly artefacts, in particular datasets and software with a common meta-
data schema. The published content can be discovered in global scholarly infras-
tructures. DataCite also provides the PID Graph [3, 4], which implements the
federated retrieval of metadata about and the relationships among numerous
scholarly artefacts, speciﬁcally articles, datasets, software, and other entities, in-
cluding organizations, projects and funders at global large-scale served by a host
of scholarly communication infrastructures. The PID Graph is accessible via the
DataCite GraphQL API20. DataCite Commons21 is a web based user interface
for content served by the PID Graph.

OpenAIRE [15, 16] enables ﬁnding and accessing scholarly articles, datasets,
software, researcher proﬁles and information about related organization. Ope-
nAIRE harvests metadata from multiple data providers, curates and dedupli-
cates the metadata to provide an integrated community service. Semantic
Scholar22 is an AI-based web tool for searching scientiﬁc literature. Its rich
REST API allows DOI-based and keyword-based queries for searching scholarly
articles. Wikidata is a knowledge graph hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation
that enables searching research articles and information about related entities
(e.g. organization, people, etc.). Data available in Wikidata is accessible via
REST API and SPARQL endpoint. Altmetric23 tracks mentions of scholarly

artefacts across multiple platforms, including social media. It provides a visu-
ally informative and aggregated overview of the attention research work receives
online. Altmetric provides access to its data via REST API.

We integrate these scholarly communication infrastructures in a federated
query service that virtually connects them at a single endpoint and enables the
eﬃcient retrieval of scholarly information in an integrated manner. The main
purpose of this federation is to abstract from their heterogeneous APIs and
enable virtualized, integrated access to the published content through a common
uniﬁed GraphQL-based interface.

Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of the federated query service.This ser-
vice does not contain the data itself, but implements an integrated schema for
the various sources and enables the execution of queries in a federated manner.
We leverage persistent identiﬁers for linking data served by the various infras-
tructures.

5.1 Visualizing ORKG Scholarly Knowledge with Context

In its paper view, the ORKG presents the content of articles, i.e. the essential
information contained in articles, in a structured, machine-readable form. We
enrich the ORKG paper view by displaying contextual information about re-
lated datasets, projects, topics and Altmetric for the displayed article, retrieved
via the described federated query service. Figure 3 illustrates the ORKG paper
view for an article. Upon viewing an article, the federated query service is au-
tomatically invoked through the integrated widget and requests the contextual
information with a single query (see Listing 1.1) in a federated manner. The arti-
cle’s meta(data) (abstract, citations, and references) is retrieved from Semantic
Scholar; related projects are retrieved from OpenAIRE; Wikidata provides in-
formation about related topics; and Altmetric provides the related metrics data.
The ﬁgure also highlights that the essential content published in an article is
available as ORKG research contributions in structured and machine-readable
form. Speciﬁcally, we highlight how some of the information contained in the
article abstract obtained from Semantic Scholar (for instance, basic reproduc-
tion number and conﬁdence interval) is represented in structured form in the
ORKG. By enriching the ORKG scholarly knowledge with comprehensive con-
textual information we ensure that users are presented rich information thus
avoiding having to explore each infrastructure individually.

5.2 Enriching ORKG Contributor Proﬁles

Contributor proﬁles provide an overview of their work, such as published articles,
datasets, software, and research topics of interest. We enrich the proﬁle view of

tual information.

ORKG contributors by displaying additional contextual information along with
the contributor information already available in ORKG, speciﬁcally: career his-
tory, published artefacts including articles, datasets, software as well as project
involvement and research topics of interest.

Figure 4 shows the contextual information retrieved by ORCID of an ORKG
contributor. The interface displays the employment history, published research
articles, datasets, and software as well as the projects the contributor has been
involved. Again, we use the federated query service to retrieve this contextual
information (Listing 1.2). The contributor’s ORCID is used to retrieve publica-
tions, datasets, and software from ORCID via the PID Graph, project informa-
tion from OpenAIRE, and research interests from Wikidata.

5.3 Advanced Faceted Search for ORKG Comparisons

ORKG comparisons are machine-readable tabular overviews of the essential con-
tent published in scholarly articles on a particular research problem [20]. These

comparisons can be saved in the ORKG by specifying metadata, title, descrip-
tion, research ﬁeld, and authors. ORKG also supports DOI-based persistent
identiﬁcation of comparisons to ensure their discoverability in global scholarly
communication infrastructures and enable their citability.

We integrate the federated query service in the ORKG comparison view to
advance its faceted search functionality. Figure 5 shows a comparison of earth
system models and a faceted search on citations to ﬁlter the comparison by
articles with citations smaller or larger than given thresholds. We retrieve the
number of citations for all articles included in the comparison from Semantic
Scholar and reﬁne the comparison according to the speciﬁed conditions.

6 Discussion

To answer our research question, we virtually integrated the DataCite PID
Graph and the REST APIs of OpenAIRE, Semantic Scholar, Wikidata, and
Altmetric to retrieve rich contextual information for ORKG scholarly knowl-
edge in a federated manner, thus enabling the execution of complex distributed
queries via a single gateway. The resulting data source abstraction facilitates the
eﬃcient development of web widgets that retrieve and display rich contextual
information in diﬀerent ORKG views for papers, contributors and comparisons.

Enriching Scholarly Knowledge with Context

11

Fig. 5: ORKG comparison of earth system models showing the faceted search
enabling reﬁning the compared articles by number of citations.

ORKG already supported faceted search for comparisons at content-level [9].
The work proposed here extends this functionality with facets for contextual
information and thus enables more complex (meta)data-driven ﬁltering. For ex-
ample, it is now possible to not only ﬁlter articles reporting a (COVID-19) basic
reproductive number (R0) > X but also having a minimum number of citations
N . Hence, the faceted search supports ﬁltering for speciﬁc research results that
also have high impact. The integration of the proposed widgets in ORKG sup-
ports users in obtaining an integrated overview of scholarly knowledge and rich
contextual information in a single view.

We compared the user interfaces of ORKG, DataCite, OpenAIRE, Semantic
Scholar, and Wikidata for information richness. Table 1 shows article contextual
information presented by each infrastructure. We observe that DataCite Com-
mons and OpenAIRE present related datasets, software, and projects whereas
Semantic Scholar provides information about citations and references. In con-
trast, ORKG presents comprehensive contextual information from these dis-
tributed scholarly infrastructures. Moreover, ORKG enables faceted search at
the level of both data (i.e. article contents) and metadata (including contex-
tual information). Lacking structured data, the other scholarly communication
infrastructures are unable to provide such functionality.

Table 2 provides an overview of contributor contextual information presented
by each infrastructure. DataCite Commons and OpenAIRE present published ar-
ticles, datasets, and software, while Semantic Scholar only provides information
about published articles. Wikidata also provides information about articles, in-
cluding topics of interest. Compared to these infrastructures, ORKG presents a
more comprehensive overview of contributor contextual information.

Currently, our widgets implementation focuses on articles, contributor pro-
ﬁles, and comparison faceted search. As the federated query service can also
retrieve contextual information about organizations, we can furthermore enrich
the ORKG organization view with linked projects, papers and other contextual

information. This will assist users in exploring what is known about organiza-
tions, their activities, outputs, and impact.

As a further direction for future work, we will consider advancing the ORKG
search with facets at both data and metadata granularity. In addition to facets
for article contents, the federated query service can power facets on contextual
information (primarily metadata about contextual entities). This enables users
to formulate more complex requests with constraints on data and metadata.
A concrete example is a search for the 10 most cited articles addressing the
research problem of estimating the COVID-19 basic reproduction number that
have reported a conﬁdence interval for the estimated number less than some
threshold T, and retrieve their citation count and the reported estimate for
basic reproduction number of the virus.

7 Conclusions

We have proposed a web widget based approach for dynamic retrieval and display
of comprehensive contextual information for scholarly knowledge. The approach
enables rich information presentation and is powered by a GraphQL-based fed-
erated query service that virtually integrates and abstracts the technological
heterogeneity of numerous scholarly communication infrastructures, in partic-
ular DataCite, OpenAIRE, Semantic Scholar, Wikidata, and Altmetric. The

Enriching Scholarly Knowledge with Context

13

approach can be extended to other scholarly communication infrastructures and
data sources more generally. To the best of our knowledge, no scholarly knowl-
edge graph shows such diverse information.

As the amount of content published by scholarly communication infrastruc-
tures continues to accelerate, rich contextual information can increase research
eﬃciency. The approach proposed and implemented in the work presented here
is an important contribution towards this aim that underscores feasibility, broad
applicability, and potential impact.
