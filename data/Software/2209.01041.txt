The Russian invasion of Ukraine has sparked renewed interest in the phenomenon of brain drain: the exodus of human capital
out of countries. Yet quantifying brain drain, especially in real time during crisis situations, remains difﬁcult. This hinders our
ability to understand its drivers and mechanisms and to anticipate its consequences. To address this gap, I draw on and extend
a large scale dataset of the locations of highly active software developers collected in February 2021, one year before the
invasion. Revisiting those developers that had been located in Russia in 2021, I conﬁrm a signiﬁcant exodus of developers from
Russia by late June 2022. 8.6% of Russian developers list a new country, compared with 2.4% of developers from comparable
countries in the region but not directly involved in the conﬂict. 11.3% of Russian developers have obscured their location (vs.
1.9% in the comparison set). Our data also allows us to observe heterogeneities in who leaves and who remains, and to see
where they are going. Developers leaving Russia were signiﬁcantly much more active and central in the collaboration network
than those who stay behind. This suggests that the most important developers have already left Russia.

Introduction

The emigration of skilled individuals, sometimes called brain drain, is known to have important economic consequences
for sending countries1. These effects can be both negative, for instance if the country cannot replace essential workers2, or
positive, for instance when leavers build social and economic networks between their origins and destinations3. Whether skilled
emigration is on net good or bad for sending countries highly depends on the push and pull factors at play in speciﬁc cases.
Push factors like war4, political instability5, and terrorism6 cause shocks of emigration that are often irreversible. In these cases
the sending country is less likely to beneﬁt from positive externalities of its diaspora.

Yet it is often difﬁcult, especially in volatile situations, to estimate how many people are leaving a country and what
their destinations are. Lack of data on high-skilled emigration also hinders our understanding of differences between those
who leave and those who stay. In recent years digital trace data has been used other contexts to provide insights a variety of
social and economic phenomenon7, 8, including migration9–11. However, less is known about the dynamics of high skilled
emigration and mobility during crises. Short term estimates of brain drain in this context would be valuable for policymakers
and decision makers responsible for long term planning and forecasting. More generally, this phenomenon deserves “meaningful
measurement”12 so that we can better understand it scientiﬁcally.

One such crisis is the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While the ﬂight of millions of Ukrainians is well-documented13, less
is known about emigration out of Russia and its supporting ally Belarus. Anecdotes and predictions of local professional
organizations14 suggest that many skilled individuals plan to or have already left these countries in response to the war15, be it
because of the effects of economic sanctions, fear of conscription, or moral opposition to the conﬂict. The Russian state has
passed laws offering IT workers and ﬁrms tax breaks and beneﬁts to entice them to stay16. Hard data on such migration would
provide important insights into long-run effects of the war on the Russian and Belarusian economies.

This article seeks to provide novel insights into brain drain by studying open source software (OSS) developers residing in
Russia and Belarus prior to the invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Both countries have signiﬁcant human capital in software
and related technical ﬁelds17. I ﬁrst estimate the number of developers who have left those countries and compare these ﬁgures
across multiple countries in the region. Second, I observe heterogeneities in activity and collaborations between those who
leave and those who stay. Finally, I report and interpret data on the destinations that developers move to.

To accomplish these aims, I use data from GitHub, the largest platform for collaborative OSS development online. I draw
on and extend a large scale geographic census of highly active developers carried out in February 202117, one year before
the invasion. I revisit the proﬁle pages of developers in the dataset, checking to see how many indicate a new geographic
location. Speciﬁcally, I compare rates of migration of developers originally from Russia and Belarus with other countries in the
region, including Ukraine. The primary empirical contribution of this work is to conﬁrm that there has been a signiﬁcant brain

drain of software developers from Russia since the outbreak of hostilities. The data also indicates important heterogeneities
between those who leave and those who stay behind: émigrés were previously signiﬁcantly more active and more central in the
collaboration network than their counterparts who stay behind. More generally, this work demonstrates that digital trace data
from professional platforms like GitHub can be used to provide relatively fast estimates of the magnitude and quality of brain
drain in crises.

Background

In this section I review some related works on the effects of brain drain. I then provide justiﬁcation why OSS developers are a
good proxy for overall ICT activity and health in a country. Finally I provide information on the context of our analyses: the
2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Related Works on Brain Drain
As human capital is one of the primary factors driving economic growth18, it is clear that the emigration of high-skilled
workers can have a signiﬁcant impact on an economy by decreasing its productivity. Second order effects are also thought to
be signiﬁcant, for example the productivity of remaining workers can suffer, especially if departing workers perform tasks
that are highly complementary to other parts of the economy, or are difﬁcult to substitute for1, 2, 19. Wages of the remaining
high-skilled workers may rise, increasing costs throughout human capital intensive industries. The most pernicious effects,
however, may be observed in the long run: human capital is more difﬁcult to replace than physical capital. Academic emigration
from Nazi Germany and deaths of academics in bombings during the Second World War diminished local research productivity
for decades20, while places which merely lost buildings and infrastructure recovered more quickly. Though there is evidence
that brain drain can beneﬁt sending countries through network effects (i.e. the transmission of information or capital back to the
home country)3 and increased incentives for local human capital formation1, it seems unlikely that these effects can manifest
when talent is pushed out by socio-economic crisis or war.

High-skilled immigrants also inﬂuence the economies of their destinations, bringing ideas and skills that can boost
productivity and innovation21–23. They can also shift the activity of locals24 and connect them with useful contacts back
home3, 25. However, when a speciﬁc ﬁeld is very competitive, high-skilled arrivals may push locals out of those labor markets26.
In the case of software development, an industry in which wages are high and jobs plentiful, the beneﬁts of the former effects,
sometimes called positive spillovers or externalities, likely outweigh the costs of the latter.

Less is known about heterogeneities between those who decide to leave and those who remain. Likely a complex mix of
push and pull factors shape any individual’s choice to emigrate. Any of a a number of individual traits like personal motivation
and ability and external factors like opportunities and costs can play a decisive role. For instance, it is known that social contacts
abroad facilitate emigration: academics dismissed from their positions by the Nazis were signiﬁcantly more likely to emigrate
if they had collaborative ties to individuals who previously left27. Such aspects also shape an émigré’s choice of destination1.
However, while more skilled individuals may have greater opportunities abroad, they may have more reasons to stay: they
may have built a strong local network and may be able to negotiate more favorable conditions. Indeed, as mentioned in the
introduction, the Russian government is actively seeking to entice key individuals and ﬁrms to stay16.

Open Source Software activity as proxy for the ICT industry
Here I argue that OSS plays a key role in the broader software industry and so serves as a useful proxy for the health and vigor
of a country’s ICT sector. OSS as a movement dates back to the 1970s and 80s28. In the decades since, some of the most
impactful and widely used software products are open source, including the Linux kernel and the Android operating system. A
detailed discussion of why open source has been so successful is beyond the scope of this paper, but the open and transparent
nature of OSS development, and its ability to integrate feedback and contributions from the crowd are key ingredients29. By
now OSS is often framed as a key infrastructure of our digital age28.

This suggests that OSS matters in the global economy. For one, the software itself generates immense economic value
as public goods that anyone can use30. But there are signiﬁcant second order effects that accrue to individuals, ﬁrms, and
places that are active in OSS. Individuals contribute to OSS for many reasons, including pure joy, but also tend to accrue real
economic beneﬁts from doing so31. For example, a proliﬁc GitHub page gives a developer a signiﬁcant value in the software
labor market32, 33; some even earn a living from crowdfunded sponsorships of their work34. Firms become more productive
from contributing to OSS35 and by using it36. OSS contributions are also valuable signals of information for investors, allowing
them to observe and verify the quality of software written by individuals and ﬁrms they are considering investing in37. These
factors and others suggest why countries beneﬁt at the macro level from local OSS contributions38. OSS activity is strongly
correlated with productivity, innovation, economic complexity, and growth outcomes at the national and regional levels17. In
these ways observed local OSS activity is a strong proxy for some of the most knowledge-intensive and productive ICT activity.

Figure 1. The relationship between national economic development and highly active developers on GitHub per capita,
adapted from17. Ukraine (UA), Belarus (BY), and Russia (RU) are signiﬁcant positive outliers from the trend line, meaning that
they have many more OSS developers than expected given their levels of economic development.

Context
Russia has occupied Crimea and supported insurgencies in two eastern Ukrainian regions since 2014. Russia’s invasion on
February 24th, 2022 nevertheless represented a signiﬁcant escalation of the scope and scale of the conﬂict. Despite observed
troop movements and reports from western intelligence services that an attack was imminent, the general public throughout
Europe was rather surprised by the invasion39. Part of the invasion went through Belarus, which provided logistical support.
Anecdotes of a sharp rise in Russian emigration, especially among high-skilled workers, quickly emerged15. Besides opposition
to the war, fear of eventual conscription was likely a signiﬁcant motive. Although Russia has not undergone general mobilization,
the invasion likely increased the risk of such an event in the near future; as young men are signiﬁcantly overrepresented in the
OSS community (often estimated at around 90% of contributors40), this would impact the majority of developers. Another
reason for skilled workers to emigrate quickly is that destination countries may restrict immigration from Russia in response to
the war. Indeed, as of August 2022, the EU is discussing suspending simpliﬁed visa procedures with Russia.

High-skilled emigration of software developers is likely to cause the Russian economy signiﬁcant trouble. Russia and other
post Soviet states have relatively developed information technology sectors, likely owing to a strong tradition of technical
and engineering education. For instance, 7.1% of gross Russian exports are categorized as information and communication
technologies by the Atlas of Economic Complexity41. Indeed, in previous work comparing economic development and per
capita contributions to Open Source Software, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus were signiﬁcant positive outliers17, see Figure 1.
People with skills in software are a key input to all growing sectors of the digital economy42, a fact underlined by persistently
high wages43 in the industry, and the high share of US H1B visas going to software engineers.

Belarus’s role in the invasion also merits discussion. Russian troops used Belarus as a staging ground for part of its invasion,
notably its attacks on Kiev, the Ukrainian capital. Weapons on Belarusian territory have ﬁred on Ukraine, and so the country is
typically thought to be an accomplice if not co-belligerent. The Belarusian presidential elections in 2020 and the subsequent
protests and large scale demonstrations continuing into 2021 likely impact our analyses of Belarusian developers, as these
events are thought to have lead to signiﬁcant brain drain themselves44.

Data

In this section I outline the original dataset surveying the global geographic distribution of active GitHub developers in February
2021. I then describe how I revisited the proﬁles of developers in late June 2022, in the aftermath of the Russian invasion, to

The Geography of OSS in 2021
A recent work mapped the geographic distribution of OSS developers using data from GitHub17. That paper used data from
GHArchive, a database of activity on GitHub, to identify individuals highly active on the platform. In particular, the dataset
consists of around 1.1 million developers who made at least 100 commits to public GitHub projects across the 2019 and
2020. Commits are elemental code contributions to OSS projects. These developers were then geolocated using three data
traces observed in February 2021: the free text location ﬁeld in their proﬁle pages, their use of geographically identifying
email sufﬁxes, and the location associated with their linked Twitter accounts, if they have one. Using the Bing Maps API
the authors could geolocate around half of the active developers to at least the country level. The resulting dataset gives a
comprehensive overview of where OSS developers live at one moment in early 2021. It also includes information on the number
of contributions made by each developer and to which project they were made. I will use this extra information to compare the
activity and collaboration network position of developers who remain in Russia with those who have left since the invasion.

Revisiting Eastern European Developers in 2022
Focusing on Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and comparable countries in the region1, I revisited the proﬁle pages of around 45,000
developers in late June 2022. I restricted my attention to those developers geolocated by their metadata on GitHub in the
previous work, ignoring Twitter data and email commit sufﬁxes. Speciﬁcally, I used the GitHub REST API to query up-to-date
user data for each developer. This information included, unchanged from 2021, as an optional free-text location ﬁeld.

There were several possible outcomes for each individual. First, an individual may have deleted their account since February
2021. Second, an individual may have the same location string in their proﬁle; in this case the individual was simply assigned
to the same geolocation as before. Finally, an individual may have updated or deleted their location string. When this new
string was identical to a location already processed before, for instance “Moscow, Russia”, the individual was assigned to
that geolocation. If the string was new, I used the Microsoft Bing API, as was done in 2021, to geolocate it. The Bing API
handles multiple languages and returns multiple suggested locations, ranked by a likelihood calculated by Bing. Following the
procedure carried out in 2021, I assigned these users to the location with the highest likelihood.

The resulting dataset includes around 45,000 observations. Each observation is a developer geolocated in one of the
countries listed above in early 2021. I record their original plain text location and Bing Maps geocode (country and, when
available region or city), and the updated equivalent on June 22nd, 2022. I also record the number of commits they made in
2019-2020, and a list of projects they made these commits to. Given the sensitive nature of this data, an anonymized version of
the dataset (removing developer login and plain text location, keeping only the geocoded data, anonymizing the projects), is
available upon request.

Results and Analyses

International Comparison
I ﬁrst compare the geographic mobility of developers originally located in various Eastern European countries. Comparing June
2022 against February 2021, I report how many developers have delete their proﬁles, how many provide an invalid (i.e. “the
moon”) or no location, and how many signal a location in a new country. The results are described in Table 1.

Over one in ﬁve developers previously located in Russian (22.9%) and Belarus (23.9%) can no longer be geolocated there.
This is three to four times higher than that of regional rate. Russian developers (8.6%) in particular are about three and half
times as likely to list a new country of residence in 2022 than developers from comparison countries (2.4%). They are also more
likely to have deleted their proﬁles (3.0% vs 2.1%) or to have obscured their location (11.3% vs 1.9%). This last observation is
especially striking: over one in ten previously geolocatable Russian developers has obscured their location. One explanation is
that signaling that one lives in Russia after the invasion has a social or economic cost. Another is that they have left Russia and
have not yet settled on a ﬁnal destination or have done so and do not wish to signal it. Unfortunately I cannot tell which of
these developers remain in Russia and which have left.

These summary statistics suggest that there has been a signiﬁcant emigration of Russian (and Belarusian) software
developers between early 2021 and June 2022. Interestingly, Ukrainian developers do not appear to have emigrated in much
greater numbers than the regional benchmark. This may be explained by the ban on young men from leaving the country and/or
widespread desire to participate in its defense.

Table 1. Statistics on OSS developers in select CEE countries, originally observed in February 2021. Developer proﬁles on
GitHub are revisited in June 2022, following the invasion. Besides the case when a developer lists the same country, proﬁles are
either deleted, list an invalid (i.e. “the moon”) or no location, or list a location in a new country. The ﬁnal column sums the
previous three. The ﬁnal row considers the aggregated statistics of countries besides Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine.

Heterogeneities between leavers and remainers
I now compare two populations of Russian developers which I call leavers and remainers. Leavers are those who list a new
country in their GitHub proﬁles. Remainers are those that still signal that they live in Russia. I examine differences between the
two in activity, their regional geographic location, and position in the pre-invasion Russian developer collaboration network.

Activity
I can quantify the activity level of different developers by counting the number of commits they made in 2019-2020. Commits
are elemental contributions of code to OSS libraries45. Recall that the threshold for inclusion in this dataset was making
100 commits across these two years. I ﬁnd that leavers were signiﬁcantly more active, see Figure 2 for a comparison of the
normalized distributions of activity between the two groups. Leavers averaged 453 commits (median: 214), while remainers
averaged 305 (median: 172).

Figure 2. Normalized distributions of activity 2019-2020 of highly active developers geolocated in Russia in early 2021. The
red dotted line is the distribution of developers who list a non-Russian location in June 2022. The blue solid line is the same for
developers who still list a Russian location. Note that the threshold for inclusion in the census was making at least 100 commits
in 2019 and 2020, hence the distributions are truncated on the left at 100.

Two developers are connected by an edge if they contribute to the same repository. Nodes colored red are geolocated to other
countries besides Russia in June 2022. Blue nodes are still in Russia, and green nodes have obscured their locations.

Geography
Developers originally from St. Petersburg and Moscow, the two leading cities of Russia, likely have larger, more diverse
networks than their counterparts from more peripheral regions46, 47. Such connections are thought to be invaluable for individuals
leaving a country in crisis27. They may also have more ﬁnancial resources they can use to move. On the other hand, developers
working in the main hubs of Russia may be more established and have more to lose by leaving. I ﬁnd a small, statistically
signiﬁcant difference: 9.5% of developers originally from these two cities now list another country compared with 8.1% of
those from other parts of Russia (MW-U 14, 843, 988; p < .01).

Collaboration Networks
OSS development, indeed software development in general, is a highly collaborative endeavour45, 48, 49. To study differences in
the collaboration patterns of the leavers and remainers, I construct the collaboration network by ﬁrst creating the bipartite graph
of developers and the GitHub repositories they make at least two commits to in the years 2019-2020. I then project this network
onto the developers, connecting them with an edge if they contribute to the same project . The resulting network gives a simple
overview of the collaborations within the Russian OSS ecosystem. It consists of 4935 non-isolated nodes and 12988 edges and
is rather fragmented: only 2208 nodes are in the largest connected component. I visualize the largest connected component in
Figure 3, coloring nodes based on their updated location. Blue nodes can still be located in Russia, red nodes are geolocated in
another country, and green nodes have obscured their location.

The visualization hints that leavers may be more connected and more central than their remainer counterparts. Indeed the
statistics bear this out. In the full network, leavers have on average 3.2 collaborators (standard deviation 10.2), while remainers
average 1.5 (s.d. 5.3). Both distributions are rather skew, so I plot the cumulative distribution of the number of connections of
leavers and remainers, respectively, with at least one connection in Figure 4. The distributions suggest that the difference in
means is not driven by a small number of outliers. For instance: roughly 10% of leavers have more than 10 collaborators, while

(in red) and a random subset of developers of the same size (1000 times, distribution in grey). Higher scores indicate greater
levels of fragmentation. The Z-score compares the targeted removal with random removal, and indicates that leavers play a
distinguished role in overall network connectivity.

only about 5% of remainers do.

The network visualization also suggests that leavers play an important structural role in the network. That is to say, leavers
are not only connected with more collaborators, but they are also occupying more important positions in the network. I quantify
the structural importance of leaving developers is via a network robustness exercise, adopting a method used to study the
resilience of protein interaction networks50. Given a network G with N nodes partitioned into a set of connected components
{C1,C2, ...Ck}, the normalized Shannon entropy of G can be deﬁned as:

H(G) = −

1
log(N)

k
∑
i=1

pi log pi,

where pi = Ci/N is the share of nodes in the i-th connected component. In a fragmented network, in which nodes are split
into small, similarly sized connected components, this entropy score tends to 1. In a network in which more nodes are in a
simple connected component, the score tends to 0.

I calculate this score for two versions of the developer collaboration network. First, I remove all of the leavers from the
network. Second, I remove a random subset of developers equal in size to the number of leavers. The second calculation serves
as a null model which benchmarks the effect of developer removal on network fragmentation. I repeat the second calculation
1,000 times and obtain a distribution of entropies under the null model, which I compare to the entropy observed when removing
leavers using a Z-score. The results are summarized in Figure 5.

The Z-score of 3.4 indicates that leavers play a distinguished role in the collaboration network. Their removal leads to
a signiﬁcantly more fragmented network than under the null model of removing the same number of developers, randomly
selected. This suggests that they are playing structurally important roles in the Russian OSS community.

Table 2. The top 20 national destinations of geolocatable developers having left Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine between January
2021 and June 2022. Russian developers disperse widely, while a majority of Belarusian developers remain in nearby countries.

Destinations
Having seen that Russian developers are indeed emigrating, and that leavers are relatively more active and collaborative, I now
turn to the question of where these people are going. I compare the top 20 destination countries of geolocatable developers
leaving Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine in Table 2.

Where do developers go? The Russian diaspora is highly dispersed - among conﬁrmed leavers, no single destination receives
more than 13% of developers. The top destinations are a mix of large advanced economies like the US and Germany and nearby
countries like Georgia and Armenia. Belarusian leavers, on the other hand, have a much smaller geographic range: over half
(53%) move to the neighboring countries of Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, or Latvia. The observed Ukrainian emigration patterns
contain elements of the other two, but are in any case much smaller in relative magnitude. Factors like ease of immigration,
previous social connections, and economic opportunity at the destination are likely to play key roles in a person’s choice of
destination. It is unclear how stable these distributions will be as the conﬂict continues.

Discussion

In this paper I have shown how digital trace data from GitHub can be used to estimate high skilled emigration during a crisis. Our
estimates suggest that somewhere between 10-20% of active Russian and Belarussian OSS developers have left their countries
between February 2021 and June 2022. This turnover is more than three times the rate observed in comparable countries from
the region not directly involved in the conﬂict. The granularity of the dataset also provides insight into heterogeneities between
leavers and remainers, as I call them. Those who left Russia are on average much more active OSS developers, and occupy a
more central position in the collaboration network. To sum up: the invasion of Ukraine has likely been a major push factor,
leading to a signiﬁcant exodus of highly skilled individuals. More generally, our ﬁndings suggest the potential of digital trace
data to map brain drain ﬂows in crisis situations.

Our approach has several limitations. First, as I comparing two snapshots of data, there are many ways in which the data
may be biased or ﬂawed. For instance I cannot be sure the if the large migration I observe happened after the invasion. The
comparison with other Eastern European countries mitigates this concern to some extent, as one would expect the evolution of
labor mobility to be roughly similar around the region. That said, I do not have an earlier estimate of the rate of change of
skilled emigration. Nor can I know the propensity of different populations to share location information or how the invasion
changed this.

Second, it is also unclear how well one can generalize these estimates of OSS developer emigration to an overall statement
about the level of brain drain from Russia. For instance, although OSS plays an important role in the bigger software ecosystem,
OSS contributors are unlikely to be characteristic of generic software developers, let alone of a generic highly-skilled or
educated individual. A third limitation is that I do not collect new data on activity or newly active developers. I don’t see, for
example, if leavers maintain their higher level of activity, or if fewer people move to Russia. Despite these and other limitations,
the weight of the evidence for a signiﬁcant wave of brain drain merits interpretation of these results in the context of related
literature on brain drain. In line with that literature, I outline potential consequences for the sending and receiving countries, in
turn.

Russia and Belarus will likely face signiﬁcant shortages of skilled software developers and experience a long term slow
down in technological growth and innovation in the software sector. Remaining software talent will become more expensive,
but it is not clear if higher wages can draw in new developers in the short or medium run, as this kind of work requires lengthy
and specialized training. These dampening effects are likely to be long lasting: the effects of human capital loses in World War
2 persisted for decades longer than the effects of damage to physical infrastructure20. To the extent that our results generalize to
other highly-skilled sectors of the Russian economy, the picture of the long run economic development of worsens.

A silver lining of brain drain in general is that leavers tend to stay in touch with their homelands1, 3. They often send
remittances, share information about new ideas and opportunities, and act as bridges in collaborations51. In the long run,
returning émigrés can have a signiﬁcant impact on local economies by bringing new skills and perspectives52. These virtuous
forces only apply if individuals who have left have an interest in remaining connected to their former homes, and perhaps in
some day returning. The data presented in this paper contain some hints that many of these emigrations, at least from Russia,
may be long lasting. For instance, the United States is by far the most popular destination among developers previously located
in Russia, while a majority of developers leaving Belarus remain in the region. Greater distances impose signiﬁcant costs on
collaboration and communication with remainers, even in OSS development53–55. In short, it is likely that Russia will face
many of the negatives of brain drain with few of the positives.

The signiﬁcant number of software developers arriving to various countries is likely to have an impact on local economies.
Our estimates, which I interpret as a lower bound on actual high-skilled software developer migration, indicate that Georgia
alone is receiving over 120 active developers. For example, the original data source estimated that Georgia hosted 180
developers in 202117. If developers settle in regions without signiﬁcant software presence they could accelerate technical
adoption23 and inﬂuence the evolution of local industries and technological sectors21, 22, 56. On the other hand there are strong
pull factors that cause high skilled émigrés sort into places where they will obtain the most reward for their skills57. The long
run outcomes of this new wave of Russian émigrés and their inﬂuence on their new homes merits continued study.
