Abstract

Fish swimming style and schooling behaviour are two important aspects
of underwater locomotion. How swimming style aﬀects ﬁsh schooling is
investigated by a representative problem setup consisting of two tethered
NACA0012 hydrofoils undulating in a free stream ﬂow at various wavelengths
λ∗ = 0.8 − 8, front-back distance D = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, phase diﬀerence
φ/π = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and lateral gap distance G = 0.25, 0.3, 0.35 with ﬁxed
Reynolds number Re = 5000, Strouhal number St = 0.4, and maximum
amplitude Amax = 0.1. In total, 336 cases were simulated by open-source
software IBAMR based on immersed boundary method. The increase in
wavelength generally leads to higher thrust and lateral force, consistent with
a previous study regarding a single swimmer. The highest Froude eﬃciency
is obtained at intermediate wavelength λ∗ = 2 for either individual or two
foils as a group. At side-by-side arrangement D = 0, the thrust force upon
the two foils can be equivalent, indicating a stable formation. At staggered
arrangement, D > 0, the follower can take signiﬁcant advantage of the leader
in locomotion performance by tuning phase diﬀerence. The follower’s beneﬁt

relative distance can lead to distinct ﬂow structures, indicating a tunable
stealth capacity of the schooling swimmers.

1. Introduction

Fish swimming has been an attractive research topic for many years due
to its interdisciplinary nature, involving hydrodynamics (Triantafyllou et al.,
2000; Liao, 2007), schooling (Ashraf et al., 2017), swimming styles (Webb,
1984), muscle anatomy (Altringham and Ellerby, 1999), physiology (Hunt
von Herbing, 2002) and sensory (Liu et al., 2016). The research has been
driven by the ﬁsh farming (Webb and Cotel, 2011) and by biomimetic under-
water robotics (Duraisamy et al., 2019; Fish, 2020). ﬁsh schooling and ﬁsh
swimming style are two interesting sub-categories among the ﬁsh swimming
problems. Multiple factors can inﬂuence the evolved schooling behaviour
and swimming style, including hydrodynamic eﬀectiveness, predator defence,
feeding, etc. Body-caudal ﬁn is one of the most common swimming styles
among ﬁsh species (Webb, 1984), with typical examples of its sub-swimming
forms shown in Fig. 1. In this study, we focus on the eﬀects of ﬁsh schooling
and BCF swimming styles on the hydrodynamics characteristics using sim-
pliﬁed physical models. This work is inspired by the biological observation
that schooling behaviour of BCF swimmers is, to our best knowledge, only
found in less wavy swimming forms, e.g. thunniform by tunas (Dai et al.,
2020), whereas schooling behaviour is undiscovered in more wavy swimming
forms, e.g. anguilliform by eels.

Fish schooling has been extensively studied in the past decades for its
hydrodynamic characteristics (Weihs, 1973, 1975). Cross sections of two
schooling ﬁsh can be represented by two vibrating cylinders immersed in
quasi-static ﬂuid; it has been identiﬁed by theoretical (Lamb, 1932; Nair and
Kanso, 2007) and numerical (Gazzola et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2018b,a, 2019)
methods that non-dimensional parameters such as phase diﬀerence can have
a distinct impact on the ﬂow-mediated interaction between the two cylin-

2

ders. Shaw (1978) estimated that at least 25% of all ﬁsh species demonstrate
schooling behaviour. Many hydrodynamic studies have focused on the min-
imal school composed of 2 identical BCF swimmers, using robotic ﬁsh (Li
et al., 2020), biological ﬁsh (Ashraf et al., 2016; Li et al., 2020), hydrofoil
experiments (Dewey et al., 2014; Kurt et al., 2020) and numerical simula-
tion (Khalid et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019). Ashraf et al. (2016) discovered a
pair of red nose tetra ﬁsh tend to swim either in-phase or anti-phase, with
the latter mode being more favourable; lateral and front-back distances are
around 0.5 and 0.2 ﬁsh body length. For this reason, we place more empha-
sis on the anti-phase scenarios in a later discussion. Li et al. (2020) found
that the locomotion eﬃciency of the followers can be achieved at any relative
leader-follower front-back distance by adjusting their tailbeat phase diﬀer-
ence. As for the schooling size larger than 2, Ashraf et al. (2017) discovered
that the phalanx, i.e. side-by-side arrangement of multiple ﬁsh, formation is
most frequently observed in the schooling of red nose tetra ﬁsh, Hemigram-
mus bleheri, which is contradictory with the previous idea that a diamond
pattern is more eﬃcient (Weihs, 1973). In the present work, we set the front-
back and lateral distances in a range similar to the previous works (Ashraf
et al., 2016, 2017; Li et al., 2020).

Fish swimming style is a curious topic that has fascinated many re-
searchers (Sfakiotakis et al., 1999; Tytell et al., 2010; Cui et al., 2018; Thekkethil
et al., 2017, 2018, 2020). Sfakiotakis et al. (1999) categorised ﬁsh swimming
styles into several classes, among which the most common one is the body-
caudal ﬁn (BCF) swimming style, featuring the body/tail undulation as the
main propulsion generator. BCF styles can be further divided into four types:
anguilliform, sub-carangiform, carangiform, and thunniform, as exempliﬁed
in Fig. 1. Thekkethil et al. (2017, 2018, 2020) simpliﬁed these BCF swim-
mers into undulating/pitching NACA0012 hydrofoils, representing diﬀerent
swimming forms by non-dimensional wavelength λ∗ = λ/C, where λ is the
swimming undulation wavelength and C is the ﬁsh chord length. For exam-
ple, anguilliform is typically represented by low wavelength λ∗ < 1, whereas
the characteristics of thunniform swimming can be captured by high wave-
length λ∗ (cid:29) 1. Thekkethil et al. (2018) discovered that low wavelength λ∗
swimmers generate thrust force by the pressure diﬀerence between anterior
and posterior body parts, whereas high λ∗ transfer streamwise momentum
by pendulum-like motion; small λ∗, e.g. anguilliform swimmers, generally
causes high locomotion eﬃciency but low thrust production, and vice versa
for large λ∗, e.g. thunniform swimmers. The numerical results obtained by

3

Thekkethil et al. (2018) are highly coherent with previously reported single
ﬁsh swimming characteristics. The present study adopts the same simpliﬁed
geometry and kinematic formula proposed by Thekkethil et al. (2018), which
will be presented later. Nangia et al. (2017a) also discovered that optimal
wavelength exists for maximum swimming speed and propulsive thrust.

As schooling and swimming styles of BCF ﬁsh both contain signiﬁcant
hydrodynamic implications, they can have a combined eﬀect on the hydro-
dynamic characteristics of underwater swimmers. To our best knowledge,
the systematic biological discussion does not exist on the behavioural corre-
lation between schooling and swimming styles. However, while the schooling
phenomenon is reported for swimmers of sub-carangiform (Trevorrow, 1998),
carangiform (Axelsen et al., 2001; Guillard et al., 2006; Hemelrijk et al., 2010)
and thunniform (Dai et al., 2020; Mitsunaga et al., 2013; Uranga et al., 2019),
anguilliform species seem never found to exhibit schooling behaviour in the
wild. Although hydrodynamics may not be the only factor aﬀecting ﬁsh’s
schooling tendency, it is reasonable to hypothesise that sub-carangiform,
carangiform, and thunniform styles are more suited for schooling than an-
guilliform styles from a hydrodynamic perspective.

To justify our numerical methodology, although robotic ﬁsh experiments
could be an eﬃcient way (Li et al., 2020) to study ﬁsh schooling with a
ﬁxed swimming style, it will be time-consuming to design and manufacture
robotic ﬁsh with variable swimming styles. To our best knowledge, exist-
ing robotic ﬁsh studies have not yet involved such a comparison between
swimming styles/wavelengths. For this reason, computational ﬂuid dynam-
ics is utilised to simulate various ﬁsh swimming styles using a representative
problem setup, thanks to its convenience in varying the swimming style by
a uniﬁed kinematic formula and the capacity to analyse the ﬂow-mediated
interaction mechanism in detail (Thekkethil et al., 2018).

In summary, for the hydrodynamics of body-caudal ﬁn swimmers, while
the mechanism of schooling has been extensively studied (Weihs, 1973, 1975;
Ashraf et al., 2016; Li et al., 2020), research on the swimming styles is
In nature, swimmers of sub-

carangiform (Trevorrow, 1998), carangiform (Hemelrijk et al., 2010) and
thunniform (Dai et al., 2020) have been reported to exhibit schooling be-
haviour, whereas the school of travelling anguilliform swimmers seems never
been reported in the wild. Here, we hypothesise that thunniform swimmers
are more adapted for schooling locomotion than anguilliform swimmers. In
this paper, this hypothesis is tested by a representative problem of two wavy

foils interacting in free-stream ﬂow. Despite simpliﬁcation, the present study
will be, to our best knowledge, the ﬁrst study regarding the combined eﬀects
of schooling and swimming styles on the BCF swimmers’ locomotion hydro-
dynamics. This work is a continuation of the previous single foil swimmer
study conducted by Thekkethil et al. (2018) and has been directly inspired
by the previous robotic (Li et al., 2020) and biological (Ashraf et al., 2017)
ﬁsh schooling studies.

2. Methodology

This section describes the numerical methodology to study the combined
eﬀects of ﬁsh schooling and swimming styles upon propulsive hydrodynam-
ics. This problem is represented by two identical wavy hydrofoils tethered
in a free-stream ﬂow, as presented in Section 2.1. Numerical simulation is
then executed by IBAMR (Griﬃth, 2013), an extensively-validated immersed
boundary software, as discussed in Section 2.2. The kinematic model of hy-
drofoil undulation is formulated by the classic travelling wave equation with
additional consideration upon the wavelengths as shown in Section 2.3. Di-
mensional analysis is conducted in Section 2.4 to formalise the investigated
problem. Mesh convergence study and validation can be found in Section 2.5.

2.1. Physical problem setup

In this paper, the two undulating rigid NACA0012 hydrofoils are ﬁxed at
their initial locations, i.e. the foils are "tethered". The non-dimensional form
of the physical problem investigated in the present paper is demonstrated in
Fig. 2. Here, C = 1 is the chord length of the two NACA0012 hydrofoils. G
and D are the lateral and front-back distances between the two hydrofoils,

5

Figure 2: Problem setup of this two ﬁsh case

respectively. The computational domain is chosen as 16C in the streamwise
direction and 8C in the transverse direction, which is identical to the domain
size chosen by Thekkethil et al. (2018). The head tip of the leader ﬁsh is
placed 5C to the inlet, and the mid-point between the two hydrofoils is
placed 4C to each of the lateral walls. As for boundary conditions, the two
identical hydrofoils are both non-slip on their ﬂuid-solid interface. The inlet
free-stream velocity is conﬁgured as Uinlet = (Ux, Uy) = (1, 0). The outlet
boundary is set as ∂ux/∂n = 0 and Uy = 0, which is equivalent to the zero
pressure outlet boundary condition, i.e. Poutlet = 0; here, n is the outward
unit vector normal to the boundary. Lateral walls on the left and right
sides of the swimming direction are both prescribed as slip wall boundary
condition ∂ux/∂n = 0 and Uy = 0. We note that we are not strictly modelling
any speciﬁc ﬁsh species but are instead seeking underlying principles of how
swimming style aﬀects schooling.

2.2. Immersed boundary method

In the present study, the numerical simulation of the ﬂuid-structure inter-
action process is achieved by a modiﬁed version of the constrained method
in the C++ open-source software IBAMR (Griﬃth, 2013).
IBAMR is con-
structed on the foundation of several libraries, including SAMRAI (Hornung
and Kohn, 2002; Hornung et al., 2006), PETSc (Balay et al., 1997, 2010,

6

Slip WallSlip WallInlet:16CFoils:Non-SlipOutlet:2001), hypre (Falgout et al., 2010; Balay et al., 1997), and libmesh (Kirk
et al., 2006). The constrained immersed boundary (IB) method of IBAMR
has been validated in various scenarios, including ﬁsh swimming (Bhalla
et al., 2013; Griﬃth and Patankar, 2020), ﬂow past cylinder(Nangia et al.,
2017b), and free-surface piercing (Nangia et al., 2019). In the present study,
the force upon each hydrofoil was obtained by the control volume method
(Nangia et al., 2017b).

The IB method uses Eulerian description for the ﬂuid and Lagrangian
description for the deforming structure. One of its advantages is the com-
putational eﬃciency due to circumventing the costly remeshing process en-
countered in other methods like the ﬁnite element method. The implemented
formulation is stated as:

Here x = (x, y) ∈ Ω represents ﬁxed physical Cartesian coordinates,
where Ω is the physical domain occupied the ﬂuid and the immersed struc-
ture. X = (X, Y ) ∈ U means Lagrangian solid structure coordinates, and U
is the Lagrangian coordinate domain. The mapping from Lagrangian struc-
ture coordinates to the physical domain position of point X for all time t
In other words,
can be expressed as χ(X, t) = (χx(X, t), χy(X, t)) ∈ Ω.
χ(U, t) ⊂ Ω represents the physical region occupied by the solid structure at
time t. u(x, t) is the Eulerian ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld and p(b, t) is the Eulerian
pressure ﬁeld. ρ is the ﬂuid density. µ is the incompressible ﬂuid dynamic
viscosity. f (x, t) and F (X, t) is Eulerian and Lagrangian force densities,
respectively. δ(x) is the Dirac delta function. More details regarding the
constrained IB formulation and discretisation process can be found in previ-
ous literature (Bhalla et al., 2013; Griﬃth and Patankar, 2020).

The non-dimensional kinematic equations for the centrelines of the two
tethered NACA0012 hydrofoils (Langley Research Center, 2021) are pre-
scribed as Eq. (5) and (6) (Thekkethil et al., 2018; Videler and Hess, 1984):

2.4. Dimensional analysis

In this paper, we investigate the ﬂow-mediated interaction between two
swimming ﬁsh with various swimming modes, which can be simpliﬁed into
two rigid NACA0012 hydrofoils with wavy lateral movement subject to free
stream ﬂow. The problem setup can be determined by 7 non-dimensional
groups as shown in Table 1, where ρ is the ﬂuid density, u∞ = 1 is the free
stream velocity, C = 1 is the hydrofoil chord length, µ is the ﬂuid viscosity, f
is the undulation frequency, amax is the maximum undulation amplitude at
tail tip, λ, g, d are the wavelength, lateral distance and front-back distance
to be non-dimensionalised by chord length C. Reynolds number Re and
Strouhal number St are ﬁxed at 5000 and 0.4, respectively, since the slowly
swimming ﬁsh generally swim with moderate Re and St ≈ 0.4, Amax ≈ 0.1
(Lindsey, 1978; Thekkethil et al., 2018). The Reynolds number at the order
of 103 allows a more economical mesh resolution and computational cost,
whereas predominant vortex dynamics still remain understandable (Liu et al.,
2017). The chosen Reynolds number is more convenient for comparison with
the previous work of single wavy foil by Thekkethil et al. (2018), which also
ﬁxed Re at 5000. The lateral and front-back distances vary in the range of
G = 0.25 − 0.35 and D = 0 − 0.75, respectively, which corresponds to the
value range chosen by Ashraf et al. (2017) and Li et al. (2020).

To examine the schooling performance of two ﬁsh-like hydrofoils, we chose
the output parameters as listed in Table 2. Here, FT,i is the net thrust force

direction. i = 1, 2 denotes the No. i hydrofoil structure; i = 1 and i = 2
represent the leader foil and follower foil respectively. Vbody,i = d∆Y ∗
i /dt∗
is the lateral motion velocity of the hydrofoils. cL,i is the force coeﬃcient
density distributed on the surface of the hydrofoil. u(x, t) is the velocity
ﬁeld of the ﬂuid.

2.5. Mesh independence and validation

IBAMR utilises two sets of "immersed" meshes for numerical simulations,
i.e. Eulerian mesh for the ﬂow ﬁeld and Lagrangian mesh for the structure
(swimmer), where the Eulerian mesh can be adaptively reﬁned considering
the local vorticity strength and adjacency to the Lagrangian described struc-
ture. In the present study, the Eulerian mesh consists of 3 levels of reﬁnement
divided by local vorticity thresholds, with each level being 4 times ﬁner than
the coarser level. The mesh density of the Lagrangian mesh for the hydrofoil
structure is equivalent to that of the ﬁnest level Eulerian mesh for the ﬂuid.
Mesh independence study was conducted using 4 meshes with diﬀerent
levels of reﬁnement, as listed in table 3. At D = 0.5, G = 0.3, λ∗ = 2.0, φ/π =
1, the time history of lateral force coeﬃcient is examined to check mesh

from CL yielded by the "Coarsest" mesh and "Coarse" mesh, the time history
of CL almost overlaps for the output produced by "Normal" and "Reﬁned"
meshes. To be conservative, the "Reﬁned" mesh setting is chosen for all the
cases in this study. Based on "Reﬁned" mesh, the current result is further
validated against results from (Thekkethil et al., 2018, pp. 10) with single
ﬁsh case of Re = 5000, St = 0.3 − 0.7, Amax = 0.1, λ∗ = 1.5, as seen in
Fig. 3b. Excellent coherence can be seen between the results produced by the
present IBAMR model and the in-house model by Thekkethil et al. (2018).

tions with a focus on the variation of wavelengths λ∗ = 0.8 − 8.0. The lateral

gap distance G ranges from 0.25 to 0.35, the front-back distance D = 0−0.75,
leader-follower phase diﬀerence φ/π = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5. The Reynolds number,
Strouhal number and maximum amplitude is ﬁxed at Re = 5000, St = 0.4
and Amax = 0.1 throughout this study. The following discussion is divided
into 2 parts: side-by-side arrangement in Section 3.2 and staggered conﬁgu-
ration in Section 3.3. The separated discussion of side-by-side arrangement
D = 0 is justiﬁed by the rich physics due to its distinguished symmetrical
ﬂow structure and potential occurrence of symmetry breaking (Gungor and
Hemmati, 2020) and by the observation of ﬁsh’s tendency to form a pha-
lanx formation in a free-stream ﬂow Ashraf et al. (2017). It is also a curious
question of how the variation of wavelength aﬀects the ﬂow symmetry and
locomotion properties. The investigation of staggered arrangement D > 0
is to understand the eﬀects of swimming style, i.e. wavelengths, upon the
vortex phase matching mechanism proposed by Li et al. (2020).

Several output parameters will be discussed to understand the schooling
eﬀect with various swimming styles, as listed in Table 2: the thrust force
CT m is directly relevant to the acceleration of the swimming foils; the lat-
eral force CLrms is linked to the work done from the undulating foil to the
incompressible ﬂuid; Froude eﬃciency ηi and ηgroup are the propulsion eﬃ-
ciency converting the input energy to the output locomotion performance as
an individual foil and as a grouped system, respectively; vorticity distribu-
tion ω∗ demonstrates the vortex interaction between the two hydrofoils and

11

the vortex shedding pattern in the wake ﬂow, in which the vortex interaction
is signiﬁcant to understand the mechanism resulting the force and eﬃciency
distribution, and vortex wake pattern is important for stealth capacity for
ﬁsh schooling behaviour.

3.1. Overview

In this subsection, we oﬀer an overview of the present paper with an ex-
ample case at G = 0.25, D = 0.75, φ = 0 and λ∗ = 0.8 − 8.0, demonstrating
its key results of vorticity distribution ω∗, thrust force CT m and the pro-
peller eﬃciency η at t∗/T = 5, as seen in Fig. 4. The irregularity of wake
ﬂow generally increases with wavelength λ∗, as seen in the vorticity contours
in Fig. 4a-4f. The ﬂow structure near the two foils is relatively regular. In
this paper, the output parameters are calculated using the last 3 stable pe-
riods. The thrust force generally increases with λ∗, whereas the propeller
eﬃciency is peaked at λ∗ = 2 in most cases, as seen in Fig. 4g-4h. The
following sections further discuss the inter-relationship between wavelengths
λ∗ and other parameters. Compared with single swimmer cases with similar
conﬁgurations (Thekkethil et al., 2018), the interaction between two wavy
foils leads to a more complicated ﬂow structure. However, the general trend
of thrust force and Froude eﬃciency is consistent with the single foil cases
(Thekkethil et al., 2018). For the sake of convenience and conciseness, the
vorticity scale in all other ﬁgures is identical to the one shown in Fig. 4.

3.2. Side-by-side arrangement D = 0

This section discusses the scenarios with two foils swimming side-by-side
D = 0. Section 3.2.1 examines the variation of swimmers’ mean thrust force
CT m, RMS lateral force CLrms, propeller eﬃciency η, and group eﬃciency
ηgroup with a series of wavelength, phase diﬀerence and lateral gap distance.
Section 3.2.3 investigates the variation of ﬂow structure with wavelength
λ∗, phase diﬀerence φ, front-back distance D and their inter-relationships
with additional discussion regarding the symmetrical anti-phase condition.
Section 3.2.2 discusses the mechanism of ﬂow-mediated interaction between
the two swimmers by examining vorticity distribution and hydrodynamic
force within one typical cycle of undulation.

3.2.1. Hydrodynamic force and propulsive eﬃciency at D = 0

At side-by-side arrangement with D = 0, the mean thrust force and RMS
lateral force generally increase with λ∗ Fig. 5, but the propeller eﬃciency only

swim in-phase φ = 0 and anti-phase φ = π, due to the symmetrical nature of
the side-by-side setting, the results of the leader overlap that of the follower.
By comparison, results of the leader at φ = 0.5π tend to coincide with that
of the follower at φ = 1.5π. These results regarding the undulation phase
diﬀerence φ are in coherence with the observed ﬁsh schooling behaviour:
when the multiple ﬁsh swim side-by-side, they tend to undulate either in-
phase φ = 0 or in anti-phase φ = π (Ashraf et al., 2017). While the previous
work by Ashraf et al. (2017) is limited to only one species, i.e. Hemigrammus
bleheri, the present results further indicate that the conclusion can be further
extended to a wide range of wavelength λ = 0.8 − 8.0.

The thrust force CT m generally increases with wavelength λ∗ reaching
maximum at λ∗ = 4.4 while swimming in-phase φ = 0 or anti-phase φ =
π, as seen in Fig. 5a, 5c and 5e. Thrust force CT m in general increases
with gap distance G while swimming in-phase φ = 0, but decreases with
G while swimming anti-phase φ = π. The ﬂow is less regular at small gap
distance G < 0.3 and anti-phase φ = π condition, causing the less smooth
curves in Fig. 5a and Fig. 5c. The lateral force CLrms on the whole increases
monotonically with λ∗, as demonstrated in Fig. 5b, 5d and 5f. As shown
in Fig. 6a, 6c and 6e, the propeller Froude eﬃciency η reaches maximum
at λ∗ = 2 and then only slightly decreases with wavelength λ∗ at λ∗ > 2
and remains almost constant at λ∗ > 5.6. One foil can achieve very high
propeller eﬃciency η at the cost of η another foil at phase diﬀerence φ = 0.5π
or 1.5π. This eﬀect is strengthened by stronger ﬂow-mediated interaction
through smaller gap distance G. The diﬀerence in eﬃciency can reach 50%
at G = 0.25. η can be negative at λ∗ = 0.8, meaning the leader or the
follower foils are not propelling forward.

When the two foils swim side-by-side, their group eﬃciency reaches a
maximum of ηgroup = 31.2% at wavelength λ∗ = 2 and phase lag φ = 0.5π,
as seen in Fig. 6b, 6d and 6f. Anguilliform swimming with low wavelength
λ∗ < 1 can lead to negative group eﬃciency ηgroup < 0, indicating that the
foils tend to drift along the inlet ﬂow direction; this tendency is strengthened
by a narrow gap G = 0.25 and in-phase undulation φ = 0. For Carangiform
swimming at high λ∗, the group eﬃciency slightly increases with the gap
distance, especially the in-phase φ = 0 scenarios. The group eﬃciency is
highly consistent for phase lag φ = 0, π and φ = 0.5π, 1.5π, at G = 0.30, 0.35
and high wavelength λ∗ > 5.

In this section, the distribution of vorticity ω∗ is observed to reveal the
ﬂuid-structure interaction mechanism underlying the aforementioned pat-
terns regarding the thrust force and swimming economy of the schooling
hydrofoils.

Wavelength λ∗ is positively correlated with shed vortices’ intensity and
scattering area, as seen in Fig. 7. At low wavelength λ∗ = 0.8 in Fig. 7a,
the vortex shedding is distributed in a narrow band at the downstream side
of the schooling foils, indicating better stealth performance for low-wave-
length swimmers. With a longer wavelength λ∗, the wake vortices can disturb
a larger area, with the ﬂow structure becoming increasingly complicated.
One vortex dipole, i.e. a pair of opposite-sign vortices, is generated in each
undulation cycle. The interaction between the shed dipoles becomes more
unsteady with a larger wavelength λ∗ (see Fig. 7) and a smaller gap distance
G (see Fig. 9).

At phalanx arrangement D = 0 and anti-phase φ/π = 1, vorticity distri-
bution is examined in Fig. 8 to seek the underlying mechanism of the irregular
force output, aforementioned in Section 3.2. Here, the two swimmers form
a mirror symmetry geometry at any moment during the undulation process.
However, the consequent ﬂow pattern does not always remain symmetrical
through the development of time; this symmetry breaking phenomenon tends
to occur with a higher wavelength. At low undulation wavelength λ∗ = 0.8,
the ﬂow pattern is symmetrical in the initial periods, and the symmetry
breaking only gradually becomes observed after the 6th period of undulation
t∗/T = 6. At high wavelength λ∗ ≥ 2.0, the wake ﬂow becomes highly ir-
regular within merely 1 or 2 initial periods of undulation; the chaotic ﬂow
structure occurs very close to the tails of the undulating ﬁsh, thus causing
the ﬂuctuation in the output thrust and lateral force (further discussed in
Section 3.2.3). Across various λ∗, the propulsive performance measurements
such as thrust force are highly consistent with the symmetric features of
the near ﬁeld wake structure. Gungor and Hemmati (2020) also discovered
similar symmetry breaking phenomenon of two hydrofoils pitching in anti-
phase, though only with inﬁnite wavelength λ∗ = +∞ at Re = 4000 and
St = 0.25 − 0.5. In summary, the irregularity of the ﬂow structure tends to
increase with undulation wavelength λ∗.

At low wavelength λ∗, the gap distance G and phase diﬀerence φ can aﬀect
the skewness, symmetry and regularity of the wake pattern, as demonstrated

17

in Fig. 9. It is interesting to observe that at φ/π = 0.5 and φ/π = 1.5, the
vortex shedding direction is slightly skewed towards the right and left sides
of the swimming direction, respectively. At φ/π = 1.0, the ﬂow structure is
symmetrical due to the anti-phase undulation of the hydrofoils. The intensity
of the vortices decreases with a larger gap distance G. With a small gap
distance G = 0.25, the vortices are distributed in a narrower band of wake
ﬂow, i.e. the dynamic energy is more concentrated at G = 0.25; in contrast,
the decrease in gap distance G is relatively less eﬀective in cases with other
phase diﬀerences φ. At φ/π = 0, mixture of vortices is observed at G = 0.25,
whereas at G ≥ 0.30, the mixture does not occur.
In summary, at low
wavelength λ∗ = 0.8, the distribution of vortices is subtly aﬀected by the gap
distance and phase diﬀerence; concentration of dynamic energy is discovered
at low gap distance and when the two hydrofoils swim in anti-phase.

3.2.3. Flow-mediated interaction between two swimmers at D = 0

For the anti-phase φ/π = 1 scenarios, the results are analysed in detail
for wavelengths λ∗ = 0.8, 2.0, 8.0 with the help of Fig. 10 to 12, where the
time history of thrust CT and the lateral force CL upon the foils are examined
together with vorticity distribution at corresponding instants within 1 period
of deformation. This conﬁguration of D = 0 and φ/π = 1 is justiﬁed by
the observation from Ashraf et al. (2017) that schooling ﬁsh tend to form
a simple side-by-side pattern with the characteristics of synchronised tail-
beating with either in-phase or anti-phase swimming modes. Ashraf et al.
(2017) previously observed the ﬁsh schooling of a single wavelength of red
nose tetra Hemigrammus Rhodostomus. Strong vortex interaction has been
identiﬁed at low gap distance G = 0.25 and anti-phase cases φ/π = 1 in
Section 3.2.2. We thus further investigate the eﬀects of wavelengths across 3
typical values λ∗ = 0.8, 2, 8.

The swimming deformation of the foils is an overlap of both lateral pitch-
ing motion and travelling sinusoidal wave. At low wavelength λ∗ = 0.8, the
component of the travelling wave becomes more signiﬁcant with a wavy ap-
pearance shown in Fig. 10. For the single foil swimming cases (Thekkethil
et al., 2018), two vortices of opposite signs are shed in each cycle of undula-
tion. In the present case of two side-by-side foils undulating in anti-phase,
strong but symmetrical interference is discovered between the vortices gen-
In the outward movement of the

swimmers’ tail tips, as demonstrated in Fig. 10a-10d, each of the two foils
produces a vortex of opposite signs, temporarily forming a vortex pair. Mean-

while, the travelling wave deforming the foils propels the ﬂuid between the
two foils, pushing these two vortices downstream. During the inward phase
of the tail tip movement, i.e. Fig. 10e-10h, each foil sheds one more vortex,
which, in the next cycle, gradually forms a vortex dipole by pairing with the
previous vortex from the same foil, i.e. Fig. 10a-10d. Eventually, the vortex
dipoles from each of the two foils repel their counterparts and travel laterally
away from each other, forming a highly symmetrical pattern of vortex dipoles
in the downstream area. Corresponding to the high level of symmetry in ﬂow
structure, the thrust of two foils are identical through the variation of time
CT,1 = CT,2, indicating the two foils reach a stable formation and propel in
a synchronised manner, as seen in Fig. 10i and 10j. The lift force of the
two foils are opposite to each other as CL,1 = −CL,2, which also periodically
switches direction; so the two foils repel each other at instants Fig. 10a-10d
while attracting each other at instants Fig. 10e-10h.

At intermediate wavelength λ∗ = 2, the highest energy eﬃciency can
be obtained as previously discussed. Here, we further analyse its vorticity
contour in order to study its ﬂow structure and ﬂuid mediated interaction.
Similar to low wavelength cases, generation of vortices is governed by the tail
tip movement. When the tail tip moves outward in Fig. 11c-11f, each foil
generates a vortex in the near-tail region. During the inward phase shown in
Fig. 11g-11h and Fig. 11a-11b, the vortices on the outer side of each foil are
generated as well. The vortex dipoles eventually form a streaming direction
that points downstream, enhancing the propulsion of the swimmers.
It is
also interesting to notice that at λ∗ = 2, the velocity of shed vortex dipoles
is almost 2 times of that at λ∗ = 0.8. The thrust and lateral force generally
follows the same pattern as the low wavelength scenario at λ∗ = 0.8.

At large wavelength λ∗ = 8.0, the swimming motion of the foils consists
mainly of pitching rather than undulation, as seen in Fig. 12. Due to the anti-
phase setting φ/π = 1, the pitching of two swimmers periodically switches
between outward and inward movement. The outward motion creates a
vortex dipole between the tails of the two swimmers, as shown in Fig. 12a-
12d. During the outward movement, the dipole stays near the tail region
despite the streaming ﬂow. The inward motion, i.e. Fig. 12e-12h, then pushes
out the vortex dipole while creating two vortices at each outer side of the
two foils. A strong jet ﬂow is also produced. In this period of motion, the
ﬂow symmetry gradually breaks, causing an increasingly complicated ﬂow
structure, which corresponds to the unsteady thrust CT m and lateral CLrms
force as seen in Fig. 12i and 12j. The symmetry breaking typically occurs at

the instant t∗/T = 2.25 in Fig. 12c, where the large vortex dipole is broken
into multiple small vortices. In addition to the near-tail vortex dipole, two
relatively small vortices emerge from the outer sides of the each foil, and
then travels along the surface of the foils. The generation of these outer
minor vortices starts to generate at the later phase of the inward pitching
movement at instant t∗/T = 2.75 Fig. 12g and instant t∗/T = 2.875 12h, and
then remains almost static in the outward pitching motion at Fig. 12a-12d;
the displacement of these minor vortices takes place during the inward motion
at Fig. 12e-12h. This phenomenon is only observed in the anti-phase cases
with high wavelength in the tested parametric space. In addition, the broken
symmetry corresponds to the irregular thrust force at anti-phase condition,
as depicted in Fig. 5.

3.2.4. Summary for side-by-side D = 0 cases

In this section, we summarise the hydrodynamic characteristics of side-by-
side cases, i.e. D = 0. The discussed content includes the thrust and lateral
force, propeller and group eﬃciency, vorticity distribution and corresponding
force time histories.

Thrust and lateral force is identical for the two foils, i.e. CT m,1 = CT m,2
and CLrms,1 = CLrms,2, at in-phase or anti-phase conditions φ/π = 0, 1.
However, such consistency is disrupted at high wavelengths λ∗ > 4, due to
the high irregularity in ﬂow structure. Thrust and lateral force of both foils
generally increase with wavelength λ∗. At λ∗ > 1, the hydrodynamic force
CT m and CLrms is highly sensitive to phase diﬀerence φ/π. Hydrodynamic
force at anti-phase φ/π = 1 can reach 6 times of that at in-phase φ/π = 0.
When the two swimmers school at a relatively large lateral distance G =
0.35, the impact of phase diﬀerence φ is reduced, whereas the ﬂow stability
is increased. Propeller eﬃciency for each individual foil η1,2 or two foils
as a group ηgroup generally reaches maximum at λ∗ = 2. Highest group
eﬃciency is obtained at intermediate wavelength λ∗ = 2, phase diﬀerence
φ/π = 0.5, 1.5 and relatively high lateral distance G = 0.35. The inﬂuence
of phase diﬀerence φ/π can be more signiﬁcant than wavelength λ∗.

Vorticity distribution ω∗ is reviewed to understand the ﬂow structure
around the two wavy foils. Wavelength λ∗ is positively correlated with shed
vortices’ intensity and the disturbed area. Vortex dipoles are generated dur-
ing foil undulation/pitching. At anti-phase φ/π = 1, vorticity distribution
can be symmetrical, since the two swimmers form a mirror symmetry ge-
ometry at any moment during the undulation process. However, symmetry

26

breaking can occur after a number of initial periods; higher wavelength leads
to broken symmetry in fewer starting periods. The irregularity of the ﬂow
structure tends to increase with undulation wavelength λ∗. At low wave-
length λ∗, the gap distance G and phase diﬀerence φ can aﬀect the skewness,
symmetry and regularity of the wake pattern. At φ/π = 0.5 and φ/π = 1.5,
the vortex shedding direction is slightly skewed towards the right and left
sides of the swimming direction, respectively. The intensity of the vortices
decreases with a larger gap distance G. Concentration of dynamic energy
is discovered at low gap distance and when the two hydrofoils swim in anti-
phase.

At side-by-side arrangement D = 0, anti-phase φ/π = 1 and wavelengths
λ∗ = 0.8, 2.0, 8.0, within one cycle of undulation, ﬂow structure at 8 instants
is examined with corresponding time histories of thrust CT and lateral CL
force upon the foils. At low wavelength λ∗ = 0.8, strong symmetrical inter-
ference exists between the vortices shed by each foil. The vortex dipoles from
each foil repel their counterparts from another foil and travel laterally away
from each other, forming a highly symmetrical pattern of vortex dipoles in
the downstream area. At intermediate wavelength λ∗ = 2, vortex dipoles
causes a streaming direction that directly points downstream, enhancing the
propulsion of the swimmers. The velocity of shed vortex dipoles is about 2
times of that at λ∗ = 0.8. At large wavelength λ∗ = 8.0, the ﬂow symmetry
breaks at t∗/T = 2.25, causing a complicated ﬂow structure. Two addi-
tional small vortices emerge from the outer sides of each foil and then travels
along the foil surface. The thrust force of two foils is generally identical
through the time histories as CT,1 = CT,2 with the lift force being opposite
as CL,1 = −CL,2, which also periodically switches direction. The force time
histories are smooth at low and intermediate wavelengths λ∗ = 0.8 − 2, but
ﬂuctuates at high wavelength λ∗ = 8 due to irregularity in ﬂow ﬁeld.

3.3. Staggered arrangement D > 0

This section discusses the situation when the two swimmers are placed in a
staggered arrangement D > 0. Section 3.3.1 studies how the non-dimensional
parameters aﬀect the leader/follower’s mean thrust force CT m, RMS lateral
force CLrms, propeller eﬃciency η, and group eﬃciency ηgroup. Section 3.3.3
examines the variation of ﬂow structure with wavelength λ∗, phase diﬀerence
φ, front-back distance D and their inter-relationships. Section 3.2.2 investi-
gates the ﬂow-mediated interaction between the two swimmers with the help
of vorticity contours and hydrodynamic force time histories.

27

3.3.1. Hydrodynamic force and propulsive eﬃciency at D > 0

For both the leader and the follower, mean thrust force CT m generally
increases with the wavelength λ∗ in the tested parametric space of G = 0.25−
0.35 and D = 0.25 − 0.75, as demonstrated in Fig. 13. The follower can take
great advantages of the schooling interaction through various wavelengths,
especially at λ∗ ≥ 5.6. This enhancement of the follower’s thrust force CT m
with λ∗ is most signiﬁcant when the two foils undulate/pitch in anti-phase
φ/π = 1.0. For example, as seen in Fig. 13a, great diﬀerence is observed
between the thrust force of the follower and that of the leader at the anti-
phase φ/π = 1.0 cases with close distance G = 0.25, D = 0.25. At high
wavelength λ∗, follower’s thrust force reach 4.5 times as large as the leader’s.
Generally speaking, this enhancement eﬀect is activated by phase diﬀerence
of φ/π = 1.0, 1.5 across various lateral G and front-back D distances, as
shown in Fig. 13. The leader-follower thrust force diﬀerence decreases when
the two swimmers are arranged at a further lateral G and front-back D
distance. Although the follower’s thrust force is generally larger than the
leader’s, exceptions are observed in a few cases. At D = 0.25 with relatively
high wavelength λ∗ > 3, the thrust force upon the leader can become greater
than the follower when the two swimmers undulates in-phase φ/π = 0. At
D = 0.50 with λ∗ > 5, leader’s thrust is higher than the follower at φ/π = 0
and 0.5. At D = 0.75 with λ∗ > 5, leader’s thrust is higher than the follower
only at φ/π = 0.5. Lateral distance G does not signiﬁcantly aﬀects this
trend. On the contrary, at low wavelength λ∗ ≤ 2.0, the follower always take
a greater advantage upon the thrust force compared with the leader. Here, we
oﬀer a more general overview regarding the eﬀects of phase diﬀerence with the
help of Fig. 13. Phase diﬀerence φ can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the follower’s net
thrust force while its eﬀects on the leader is less prominent. The eﬀect of the
phase diﬀerence becomes less signiﬁcant with the enlargement of the lateral
gap G and the front-back distance D, as demonstrated by the converging
values of CT m from Fig. 13a to 13i. The variation of φ is more inﬂuential at
high wavelength λ∗ > 3 while being less eﬀective at low wavelength λ∗ ≤ 2.
The RMS of lateral force CLrms increases monotonically with wavelength
λ∗ despite the variation of other parameters, as seen in Fig. 14. The lateral
force greatly increases with the wavelength λ∗, reaching as high as CLrms = 18
for both swimmers, at short distance G = 0.25, D = 0.25 and anti-phase
φ/π = 1, as shown in Fig. 14a. Regarding the eﬀects of the phase diﬀerence
φ, the lateral force CLrms reaches minimum when the two hydrofoils swim

in-phase φ/π = 0 while reaching maximum at anti-phase φ/π = 1 condition
with front-back distance D ≤ 0.50, as seen in Fig. 5b and 14. However, at
D = 0.75, this relationship is reversed that the minimal CLrms is found at
anti-phase condition whereas the maximal CLrms is discovered at in-phase
scenarios. This observation can be postulated to be related with vortex
shedding and its impingement upon the follower. As the distances G and
D increase, the phase diﬀerence φ becomes less inﬂuential upon the lateral
force CLrms for both the leader and the follower, as shown in Fig. 14. With
the increase of lateral gap G and front-back distance D, the diﬀerence of
lateral force CLrms between the leader and the follower becomes smaller; as
the lateral gap increases from G = 0.25 to 0.35 and the front-back distance
rises from D = 0.25 to 0.75, the leader-follower lateral force diﬀerence de-
creases from 2.5 to 0.5, as seen in Fig. 14a to 14i. Compared with the large
leader-follower diﬀerence for the thrust force CT m previously discussed, the
leader-follower discrepancy in lateral force CLrms is relatively small, espe-
cially at short distances G = 0.25, D = 0.25 indicating the thrust force is
more sensitive to the schooling eﬀect than the lateral force, across the tested
wavelengths.

The individual propeller eﬃciency η for each swimmer generally reaches
minimum at wavelength λ∗ = 0.8 while peaking at λ∗ = 2.0, as seen in
Fig. 15. With a relatively high wavelength λ∗ > 2.0, phase lag φ aﬀects how
λ∗ inﬂuences the follower’s propeller eﬃciency ηf ollower: at in-phase φ/π = 0
condition, ηf ollower greatly decreases with wavelength λ∗; at φ/π = 0.5, the
negative relationship between λ∗ and ηf ollower is less signiﬁcant than that at
φ/π = 0; at φ/π = 1.0 and 1.5, the result generally remains constant regard-

ﬂuences the propeller eﬃciency, being consistent with the conclusion by Li
et al. (2020). The follower’s eﬃciency ηf ollower is generally higher than the
leader’s ηleader, most signiﬁcantly at front-back distance D = 0.25 and phase
lag φ/π = 1.5, as demonstrated in Fig. 15a to 15c; the leader’s propeller ef-
ﬁciency can only be slightly higher than the follower’s at in-phase condition
φ/π = 0 and high wavelength λ∗ > 7. In the present combinations of input
parameters, the leader eﬃciency can be negative at λ∗ = 0.8 when the front-
back distance is small D ≤ 0.50, meaning the leader is moving backwards
along the ﬂow direction. At D = 0.75, the swimmers’ eﬃciency is all positive
except at φ/π = 1.0, 1.5 with low wavelength λ∗ = 0.8.

parametric space, ηgroup generally increases with lateral gap G and front-
back distance D across various wavelengths λ∗, as seen in Fig. 16. At low
wavelength λ∗ = 0.8, the group eﬃciency is especially sensitive to front-back
distance D but less sensitive to lateral distance G, being consistent with the
conclusions by Li et al. (2020). The increase of front-back distance D and
lateral gap G leads to reduced sensitivity regarding phase lag φ across various
wavelengths λ∗ = 0.8 − 8, as seen in Fig. 16i for the almost overlapped lines;
this trend corresponds to the reduced diﬀerence in propeller eﬃciency η be-
tween the leader and the follower, as seen in Fig. 16, implying reduced ﬂow
mediated interference between the two swimming foils. At low wavelength
λ∗ = 0.8, the negative group eﬃciency is observed at front-back distance
D ≤ 0.50 but not found in cases with D = 0.75. It is an indication that,
for schooling Anguilliform swimmers, it can be critical to keep an appropri-
ate front-back distance D, which may even reverse the collective propulsive
direction of the swimmer group; in contrast, the schooling performance for
Carangiform or Thunniform swimmers with high wavelength λ∗ > 6 is more
stable; its group eﬃciency does not vary signiﬁcantly with phase lag φ and
front-back distance. This is in support of the hypothesis that the Carangi-
form and Thunniform swimmers are more suitable for schooling in contrast
with Anguilliform swimmers.

3.3.2. Vorticity distribution at D > 0

The wavelength λ∗ and the phase lag φ inﬂuence the vortex strength and
shedding pattern in diﬀerent ways, as seen in Fig. 17. At λ∗ = 0.8, the
general vortex shedding pattern is barely aﬀected by the variation in phase
diﬀerence φ. The dipoles shed by the two foils hardly interact with each
other, especially when the two foils swim in-phase φ = 0, as seen in Fig. 17a.
The dipoles steadily drift downstream, meaning the streaming direction is
stable as well. At λ∗ = 2.0, signiﬁcant interference between the dipoles
leads to irregular ﬂow structure in the downstream area of the two foils.
However, in the area between the two foils, the ﬂow structure is regular and

predictable, indicating the interaction between the two foils should largely be
periodical despite the complex pattern in the downstream. Phase lag φ can
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the ﬂow structure in the area immediately downstream the
follower foil. At λ∗ = 8.0, the ﬂow pattern is similar to that at λ∗ = 2.0. In
summary, despite subtle diﬀerences observed, the general wake ﬂow pattern
is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the phase diﬀerence φ; this also corresponds
to the results in Fig. 16.

In order to examine the inter-relationship between wavelength λ∗, front-
back distance D, and wake ﬂow structure, we draw the vorticity contours
across various wavelengths λ∗ and front-back distances D, as seen in Fig. 18.
At front-back distance D = 0.25, as seen in Fig. 18a-18c, the vortex dipoles
shed by each hydrofoil do not mix in the wake ﬂow, but bifurcating towards
two distinct directions, forming an angle with a near-perfect mirror symme-

35

try about the centreline. This symmetrically stable ﬂow structure persists
despite the variation of wavelengths λ∗. Such near-symmetrical patterns
were only observed in cases with phalanx arrangement D = 0 and anti-phase
φ/π = 1 condition, e.g. cases discussed in Section 3.2.2 and results from
another paper focusing on wake symmetry by Gungor and Hemmati (2020).
It is therefore interesting to observe a very similar pattern at a staggered
placement D = 0.25 with in-phase φ/π = 0 undulation. To explain this
phenomenon, we further examine the underlying hydrodynamic mechanism.
The front-back distance of D = 0.25 causes positive vortex from the present
half-cycle of the follower to collide with the negative vortex from the previous
half-cycle of the leader. These two vortices collide with each other but cannot
merge together due to their opposite rotating direction, thus pushing each
other away while drifting downstream, eventually leading to a steady ﬂow
structure with a certain angle. This periodic ﬂow pattern does not lead to
an outstanding thrust force or locomotion eﬃciency as previously discussed,
yet it may contain implications for stealth capacity of the swimmers. As for
cases at D ≥ 0.50, the wake ﬂow structure is more irregular due to unsteady
interaction among dipoles, e.g. some vortices merge together to form a larger
one. The overall vorticity strength and the degree of irregularity both in-
crease with the wavelengths λ∗. Although the wake ﬂow is irregular for the
cases at D ≥ 0.50, the ﬂow structure near the two foils is largely predictable,
especially in the area between the two foils.

3.3.3. Flow-mediated interaction between two swimmers at D > 0

At D = 0.75, λ∗ = 0.8, the wake vorticity pattern looks as if each of the
two foils swims as a single foil, i.e. interference between the wake ﬂows by
two foils are visibly insigniﬁcant, as viewed in Fig. 19a-19h. However, large
discrepancy of thrust force CT is discovered between the two swimmers; the
leader’s thrust force is generally negative, whereas the follower’s is on the
whole positive, as seen in Fig. 19i and 19j, indicating that the two foils
are attracted towards each other due to the ﬂow-mediated interaction. The
lateral force CL of the two foils is dissimilar from each other, which is diﬀerent
from the almost symmetrical lateral force time history at higher wavelength
λ∗ = 2, 8. In other words, the lateral force is more sensitive to the ﬂow-
mediated interaction between the two swimmers. This thrust and lateral
force discrepancy may be further relevant to the pressure suction mechanism
(Blickhan et al., 1992) that is most typical in low wavelength swimmers.

At D = 0.75, λ∗ = 2, the leader’s upward vortices collides with the

the follower’s vortex street, causing great disturbance in the wake ﬂow of
the follower, as seen in Fig. 20. "Vortex swapping" periodically takes place
between the two foils, which is the swapping of positive vortices between
the two swimmers: the leader’s positive vortex from previous undulating cy-
cle is entrained by the upward motion the follower’s tail tip; eventually the
leader’s positive vortex pairs up with the follower’s negative one, whereas the
follower’s positive vortex moves downward to pair with the leader’s negative
one. The thrust force CT of the two swimmers demonstrates a phase diﬀer-
ence of about T /2, although the lateral force amplitude upon the follower
is about 40% larger than the that upon the leader. Similar pattern is also
observed in the case at λ∗ = 8, which will be discussed later.

At D = 0.75, λ∗ = 8, the general ﬂow structure is composed of several
large vortices, as shown in Fig. 21, rather than being broken into numerous
small ones, as previously seen in Fig. 12. Periodical interaction occurs in the
region between the two foils, whereas in the wake ﬂow, the vortex interaction
is irregular and unpredictable. In the region between the two foils, the vortex
pattern near the tail tip of the leader is very similar to that of a single pitching
foil (Thekkethil et al., 2018), whereas a small vortex is generated from the

the wake ﬂow region, with the strong disturbance produced by λ∗ = 8, the
front-back distance D = 0.75 allows the interaction of vortices generated
from diﬀerent cycles and diﬀerent swimmers. The vortex dipoles may swap
their partners if collision between the dipoles occurs; the consequent new
pair may draw a unique trajectory that further disturbs the wake ﬂow. The
thrust and lateral force upon the two foils is smooth in general, as seen in
Fig. 21i and 21j, corresponding to the relatively regular ﬂow structure near
the tail regions of the two foils. The lift force of the two foils are just opposite
to each other CL,1 = −CL,2, i.e. the amplitude of lift force is almost identical,
yet the thrust force of the follower is generally larger than that of the leader.
It is also interesting to note a half period phase diﬀerence between the leader
and the follower’s thrust force, which can only be caused by the interaction
of vortex.

3.3.4. Summary for staggered D > 0 cases

This section provides a summary of the hydrodynamic characteristics for
two foils swimming in staggered arrangement D > 0. The upstream swimmer
is identiﬁed as the leader, while the downstream one as the follower.

Thrust force CT m for either swimmer generally increases with wavelengths
λ∗. The follower’s thrust force can be much larger than the leader’s, i.e.
CT m,f ollower > CT m,leader, especially at high λ∗ and φ/π = 1, 1.5. For the
follower, the maximum achievable thrust force by tuning phase lag φ de-
creases with both lateral G and front-back distances D. The RMS of lateral
force CLrms increases monotonically with wavelength λ∗, reaching as high as
CLrms = 18 for both swimmers at short distances G = 0.25, D = 0.25 and
anti-phase φ/π = 1.

Propeller eﬃciency of either foil η1,2 or two foils as a group ηgroup reaches
minimum and maximum at λ∗ = 0.8 and λ∗ = 2, respectively, and then
gradually decreases at λ∗ > 2. The follower’s eﬃciency ηf ollower is gener-
ally higher than the leader’s ηleader. Phase lag φ is more inﬂuential to the
follower’s eﬃciency than the leader’s, especially at high wavelength λ∗ > 2
and close front-back distance D ≤ 0.5. The follower’s propeller eﬃciency
signiﬁcantly decreases with a further front-back distance D, while slightly
increasing the leader’s.

41

Group eﬃciency ηgroup reaches a maximum of 33.3% at D = 0.75 and λ∗ =
2.0. Group eﬃciency ηgroup generally increases with lateral gap G and front-
back distance D across various wavelengths λ∗. At low wavelength λ∗ = 0.8,
the group eﬃciency is especially sensitive to front-back distance D, whereas
eﬀects of lateral gap G is less prominent. Phase lag φ is more inﬂuential
to group eﬃciency ηgroup at close distances across tested wavelengths λ∗ =
0.8 − 8.

Vorticity distribution is examined to understand how various non-dimensional

parameters aﬀect the ﬂow structure surrounding the two foils. The overall
vorticity strength and the degree of irregularity both increase with the wave-
lengths λ∗ with various front-back distance D, whereas the general wake ﬂow
pattern is only slightly aﬀected by the phase diﬀerence φ. At λ∗ = 0.8 − 3.2,
D = 0.25, the vortex dipoles shed by each hydrofoil do not mix in the wake
ﬂow, but bifurcating towards 2 distinct directions, forming a mirror symme-
try pattern. At D ≥ 0.50, the wake ﬂow structure is more irregular due to
unsteady interaction among dipoles that vortices can merge together to form
a larger one.

Flow-mediated interaction mechanism is examined in 8 instants within
1 period at D = 0.75 with low, intermediate, and high wavelengths λ∗ =
0.8, 2, 8. The staggered arrangement D > 0 allows vortices generated from
diﬀerent cycles of undulation/pitching to interact with each other, leading
to a phase lag in the thrust force history. Distinct ﬂow structure and force
variation emerges with the change of wavelengths λ∗. At D = 0.75, λ∗ = 0.8,
the wake vorticity pattern looks as if each of the two foils swims as a single
foil. At D = 0.75, λ∗ = 2, the leader’s upward vortices collides with the
the follower’s vortex street, causing great disturbance in the wake ﬂow of
the follower. Vortex swapping periodically takes place between the two foils.
The thrust force CT of the two swimmers demonstrates a phase diﬀerence
of about T /2. At D = 0.75, λ∗ = 8, the general ﬂow structure is composed
of several large vortices. Periodical interaction occurs in the region between
the two foils, whereas in the wake ﬂow, the vortex interaction is irregular
and unpredictable. In the region between the two foils, the vortex pattern
near the tail tip of the leader is very similar to that of a single pitching foil,
whereas a small vortex is generated from the left side of the follower’s head
that eventually merges with the large vortex at tail. In the wake ﬂow region,
with the strong disturbance produced by λ∗ = 8, the front-back distance
D = 0.75 allows the interaction of vortices generated from diﬀerent cycles
and diﬀerent swimmers. Vortex dipoles may swap their paired partners if

42

collision occurs, further disturbing the wake ﬂow. The thrust and lateral
force upon the two foils is smooth in general, corresponding to the relatively
regular ﬂow structure near the tail regions of the two foils. The lift force

interesting to note a half period phase diﬀerence between the leader and the
follower’s thrust force, which can only be caused by the interaction of vortex.

4. Conclusion

Fish swimming is a classic topic that involves rich physics (Webb, 1984;
Triantafyllou et al., 2000; Liao, 2007; Ashraf et al., 2017) with applications
in biomimetics (Duraisamy et al., 2019; Fish, 2020) and ﬁsh farming (Webb
and Cotel, 2011). Among the problems of ﬁsh swimming, abundant research
exists for both ﬁsh schooling (Weihs, 1973, 1975; Ashraf et al., 2016; Li et al.,
2020) and swimming styles (Sfakiotakis et al., 1999; Tytell et al., 2010; Cui
et al., 2018; Thekkethil et al., 2017, 2018, 2020). However, the combined ef-
fect of swimming style and schooling upon hydrodynamics of BCF swimmers
In the present paper,
has never been systematically examined in details.
we investigate how swimming style aﬀects ﬁsh schooling by a representative
problem setup consisting of two NACA0012 hydrofoils undulating at various
wavelengths λ∗ = 0.8 − 8, front-back distance D = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, phase
diﬀerence φ/π = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and lateral gap distance G = 0.25, 0.3, 0.35
with ﬁxed Reynolds number Re = 5000, Strouhal number St = 0.4, and
maximum amplitude Amax = 0.1. In total, 336 combinations were simulated
by ConstraintIB module of IBAMR. Here, we classify the results by the rel-
ative front-back distance between the two foils as side-by-side D = 0 and
staggered D > 0 conditions.

The swimming style of BCF swimmers is represented by wavelengths λ∗.
Low wavelength λ∗ < 1 corresponds to anguilliform swimmers, whereas high
wavelength λ∗ (cid:29) 1 for the thunniform ones. In the tested parametric space,
the increase in wavelength λ∗ results in larger thrust CT m and monotonic
increase of lateral CLrms force. Propeller eﬃciency of either foil η1,2 or two
foils as a group ηgroup reaches minimum and maximum at λ∗ = 0.8 and λ∗ = 2,
respectively, and then gradually decreases or remains constant at λ∗ > 2. It
indicates high eﬃciency but low acceleration for swimmers of intermediate
wavelength λ∗ = 2 and vice versa for high wavelength swimmers λ∗ > 2. Low
wavelength λ∗ = 0.8 causes both low eﬃciency and low acceleration due to
the ﬁxed Strouhal number St = 0.4. The increase in wavelength also results

43

in strong vortex and irregular ﬂow structure. These eﬀects of wavelength for
schooling foils is consistent with that for the single foil cases by Thekkethil
et al. (2018).

Phase diﬀerence φ and front-back distance D can aﬀect the interaction
between vortex shed by the leader and undulating body of the follower (Li
et al., 2020), thus greatly impact the consequent thrust force and propeller
eﬃciency. The undulation phase diﬀerence φ between the two schooling
hydrofoils φ can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the thrust/lateral force and the individ-
ual/group propeller eﬃciency, especially at close distances. The follower’s
force and eﬃciency is most sensitive to phase diﬀerence at intermediate or
high wavelength λ∗ > 1, whereas group eﬃciency is most inﬂuenced by phase
diﬀerence at low wavelength λ∗ < 1. In other words, by tuning the phase dif-
ference, low wavelength swimmers can school with signiﬁcantly higher group
eﬃciency. For the follower swimming at a high wavelength and close dis-
tances, phase tuning can eﬀectively improve its acceleration and eﬃciency.
The inﬂuence of phase diﬀerence φ/π can be more signiﬁcant than wavelength
λ∗ in some cases.

Front-back distance D can greatly aﬀect the follower’s thrust force and
propeller eﬃciency while exerting considerable impact on group eﬃciency at
low wavelength λ∗ < 1 as well. A closer front-back distance generally results
in advantageous acceleration and high eﬃciency for the follower, especially
at high wavelength λ∗ (cid:29) 1, i.e. thunniform swimming style; however, a
further distance is more beneﬁcial to the group eﬃciency, especially at low
wavelength λ∗ < 1, i.e. anguilliform swimming style. At close front-back
distances, phase lag φ becomes more inﬂuential to group eﬃciency ηgroup
across λ∗ = 0.8 − 8.
It is an indication that, for schooling anguilliform
swimmers, it can be critical to keep an appropriate front-back distance D,
which may even reverse the collective propulsive direction of the swimmer
group; in contrast, the schooling performance for thunniform swimmers with
high wavelength λ∗ > 6 is more stable; its group eﬃciency does not vary
signiﬁcantly with phase lag φ, especially at further front-back distance D ≥
0.75. This point is in support of the hypothesis that thunniform swimmers
are more suitable for schooling in contrast with anguilliform swimmers.

Lateral gap distance G can only slightly inﬂuence the leader-follower in-
teraction in the tested range of G = 0.25 − 0.35. For the follower, the
maximum achievable thrust force by tuning φ and λ∗ slightly decreases with
lateral gap G. Group eﬃciency ηgroup generally increases with lateral gap G
across various wavelengths λ∗.

44

The leader and the follower are aﬀected by these parameters in diﬀerent
ways. The follower’s propulsive eﬃciency ηf ollower is generally higher than
the leader’s ηleader. Phase diﬀerence φ is more inﬂuential to the follower’s
eﬃciency than the leader’s, especially at high wavelength λ∗ > 2 and close
front-back distance D ≤ 0.5. At high λ∗ (cid:29) 1 and φ/π = 1, 1.5, the follower’s
thrust force can be much larger than the leader’s.

Vorticity distribution ω∗ is reviewed to understand how various non-
dimensional parameters aﬀect the ﬂow structure surrounding two foils. The
overall vorticity strength and the ﬂow irregularity both increase with the
wavelengths λ∗ regardless of front-back distance D, whereas the general wake
ﬂow pattern is only slightly aﬀected by the phase diﬀerence φ. Vortex dipoles
are generated during foil undulation/pitching. At side-by-side D = 0 and
anti-phase φ/π = 1, vorticity distribution can be symmetrical, since the two
swimmers form a mirror symmetry geometry at any moment during the un-
dulation process. However, symmetry breaking can occur after a number of
initial periods, especially at high wavelength. At D = 0.25, λ∗ = 0.8 − 3.2,
the shed vortex dipoles bifurcates towards 2 distinct directions, forming a
mirror symmetry pattern. At D ≥ 0.50, λ∗ = 0.8 − 3.2, the wake ﬂow struc-
ture becomes irregular due to unsteady interaction among vortex dipoles. At
low wavelength λ∗ < 1, the gap distance G and phase diﬀerence φ can aﬀect
the skewness, symmetry and regularity of the wake pattern. At φ/π = 0.5
and φ/π = 1.5, the vortex shedding direction is slightly skewed towards the
right and left sides of the swimming direction, respectively. The intensity
of the vortices decreases with gap distance G. Concentration of dynamic
energy is discovered at low gap distance and when the two hydrofoils swim
in anti-phase.

Flow structure surrounding the two foils is examined at 8 consecutive in-
stants within the 3rd cycle of undulation/pitching, i.e. t∗/T = 2 − 3, together
with time histories of thrust CT and lateral CL force within that cycle. Side-
by-side D = 0 and staggered D = 0.75 cases are studied at low λ∗ = 0.8,
intermediate λ∗ = 2 and high λ∗ = 8 wavelengths, whereas the foil-to-foil
phase diﬀerence remains constant at anti-phase φ/π = 1.

At side-by-side D = 0 arrangement and anti-phase φ/π = 1, the most
distinct ﬂow characteristics is the symmetrical ﬂow pattern, which breaks
easily at high wavelength. At low wavelength λ∗ = 0.8, the ﬂow structure is
highly symmetrical. At intermediate wavelength λ∗ = 2, where the highest
energy eﬃciency is obtained, vortex dipoles form a streaming direction that
directly points downstream. At large wavelength λ∗ = 8.0, the ﬂow symmetry

45

is broken, causing a complicated ﬂow structure, whereas two additional small
vortices emerge from the outer sides of two foils.

At staggered arrangement D = 0.75 and anti-phase φ/π = 1, vortices shed
from the leader can interact with those from the follower by from diﬀerent
cycles due to the front-back distance, leading to a delayed impact upon the
foil body, thus a phase lag in the eventual thrust force history. At low
wavelength λ∗ = 0.8, the vorticity pattern looks as if the each foil swims as a
single foil. At intermediate wavelength λ∗ = 2, Vortex swapping periodically
takes place between the two foils. At high wavelength λ∗ = 8, the general
ﬂow structure consists of several large vortices. Periodical interaction occurs
near the two foils despite the irregular wake ﬂow.

The hydrodynamic thrust and lateral force upon the two foils is smooth
in general, except for the cases with side-by-side D = 0 arrangement and
high wavelength λ∗ = 8, where the ﬂow structure near the foils are highly
fractured. At either side-by-side D = 0 or staggered D = 0.75 arrangement,
the lift force of the two foils are generally opposite to each other CL,1 =
−CL,2, especially at λ∗ > 2. At side-by-side D = 0 arrangement, thrust
force upon the two foils is generally identical through the time histories as
CT,1 = CT,2. In contrast, at staggered arrangement D = 0.75, a half period
phase diﬀerence is discovered between the leader and the follower’s thrust
force, caused by the delayed vortex interaction due to front-back distance;
the thrust force of the follower is generally higher than that of the leader.

The low and high wavelength in this paper corresponds to anguilliform
and thunniform swimmers, respectively. One attempt of the present paper
is to test the hypothesis that thunniform swimmers are more adapted for
schooling locomotion than anguilliform swimmers. Several biological impli-
cations can be derived from the above analysis. The group energy eﬃciency
of anguilliform swimmers is more sensitive to relative distance and undulation
phase diﬀerence, implying a less stable collective eﬃciency than the thunni-
form swimmers. While schooling together, the anguilliform swimmers tend
to produce a more stable wake ﬂow than the thunniform swimmers, disturb-
ing less area of the ﬂuid. This implies a better stealth performance for the
anguilliform swimmers. At side-by-side arrangement, the thrust force pro-
duced by various swimming styles is roughly equivalent, given the in-phase
or anti-phase coordination. This implies the side-by-side arrangement can be
a stable formation regardless of swimming styles, given the maintenance of
appropriate lateral distance. However, at such stable formation, anguilliform
swimmers do not produce a beneﬁcial propeller eﬃciency. This means that

46

the anguilliform swimmers can be locked in a stable formation with undesir-
able eﬃciency, making it less suitable for schooling locomotion. Thunniform
swimmers produce better thrust force, although not obtaining the best loco-
motion eﬃciency, which is coherent with single swimming foil as studied in
Thekkethil et al. (2018). For the above implications, the current results are
in support of the hypothesis that thunniform swimmers are more hydrody-
namically adapted to schooling locomotion than the anguilliform swimmers.
These conclusions can also be useful for the schooling locomotion of ﬁsh-like
robots.
In the future, we intend to continue the present study by three-
dimensional and self-propelled simulations.
