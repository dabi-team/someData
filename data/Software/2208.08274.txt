Figure 1: Our proposed morphology-aware inverse kinematics approach unlocks novel artistic workflows such as the one
depicted above. Animator takes a photo of a multi-person scene or grabs one of the many pictures available on the web and
uses it to initialize a 3D scene editable through a number of advanced animation tools. Our approach enables applying a multi-
person 3D scene acquired from a RGB picture to custom user-defined characters and editing their respective 3D poses with
the state-of-the-art machine learning inverse kinematics tool integrated in a real-time 3D development software.

ABSTRACT
Inverse Kinematics (IK) systems are often rigid with respect to their
input character, thus requiring user intervention to be adapted to
new skeletons. In this paper we aim at creating a flexible, learned
IK solver applicable to a wide variety of human morphologies. We
extend a state-of-the-art machine learning IK solver to operate on
the well known Skinned Multi-Person Linear model (SMPL). We
call our model SMPL-IK, and show that when integrated into real-
time 3D software, this extended system opens up opportunities for
defining novel AI-assisted animation workflows. For example, pose
authoring can be made more flexible with SMPL-IK by allowing
users to modify gender and body shape while posing a character. Ad-
ditionally, when chained with existing pose estimation algorithms,
SMPL-IK accelerates posing by allowing users to bootstrap 3D

1 INTRODUCTION
Inverse Kinematics (IK) is the problem of estimating 3D positions
and rotations of body joints given some end-effector locations [Aris-
tidou et al. 2018; Kawato et al. 1993]. IK is an ill-posed nonlinear
problem with multiple solutions. For example, given the 3D location

of the right hand, what is a realistic human pose? It has been shown
recently that machine learning IK model can be integrated with 3D
content authoring user interface to produce a very effective pose
authoring tool [Bocquelet et al. 2022; Oreshkin et al. 2021]. Using
this tool, an animator provides a terse pose definition via a limited
set of positional and angular constraints. The computer tool fills in
the rest of the pose, minimizing pose authoring overhead.

The Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model is a princi-
pled and popular way of jointly modelling human mesh, skele-
ton and pose [Loper et al. 2015]. It would seem natural to extend
this model with inverse kinematics capabilities: making both hu-
man shape/mesh and pose editable using independent parameters.
Additionally, many computer vision pose estimation algorithms
naturally operate in the SMPL space making them natively com-
patible with a hypothetical SMPL IK model. This extension would
open new content authoring opportunities. However, to date SMPL
models have not been integrated with advanced machine learning
IK tools, and this represents a clear research gap.

In our work we close this gap, exploring and solving two inverse
problems in the context of the SMPL human mesh representation:
SMPL-IK, an Inverse Kinematics model, and SMPL-SI, a Shape In-
version model. We show how these new components can be used to
create new artistic workflows driven by AI algorithms. For example,
we demonstrate the tool integrating SMPL-IK and SMPL-SI with
an off-the-shelf image-to-pose model, initializing a multi-person
3D scene editable via flexible and easy-to-use user controls.

2 BACKGROUND
Inverse Kinematics is a prominent problem in robotics and ani-
mation, which traditionally has been often solved by analytical or
iterative optimization methods such as CCD [Kenwright 2012] or
FABRIK [Aristidou and Lasenby 2011] (please refer to Aristidou
et al. [2018] for a comprehensive review). Solving IK using machine
learning techniques has consistently attracted attention [Bócsi et al.
2011; De Angulo and Torras 2008; D’Souza et al. 2001], with more
work focusing on neural networks based methods [Bensadoun et al.
2022; Duka 2014; El-Sherbiny et al. 2018; Holden et al. 2016; Levine
and Koltun 2014; Mourot et al. 2022]. The current state-of-the-art IK
neural network based approach is ProtoRes [Oreshkin et al. 2021]. It
takes a variable set of effector positions, rotations or look-at targets
as inputs, and performs IK to reconstruct all joint locations and
rotations. Its effectiveness in editing complex 3D character poses
has recently been demonstrated within digital content creation
software in a live demonstration [Bocquelet et al. 2022]. Although
ProtoRes is trained on MoCap data, it does not explicitly include
any learnt body shape prior as it is trained on a fixed skeleton. In
this work, we relax this limitation by integrating it with SMPL.
SMPL is a realistic 3D human body model parameterized by the
body’s shape and pose based on skinning and blend shapes [Loper
et al. 2015]. SMPL realistically represents a wide range of human
body shapes controlled by shape parameters, as well as natural
pose-dependent deformations controlled by pose parameters. Al-
though there have been some extensions to the SMPL model such
as SMPL+H [Romero et al. 2017], SMPL-X [Pavlakos et al. 2019],
STAR [Osman et al. 2020], etc., SMPL remains a standard model to
represent realistic human body pose. SMPL is widely used for 3D

pose estimation of humans in images and video [Bogo et al. 2016; Li
et al. 2021; Luo et al. 2020; Rajasegaran et al. 2021; Sun et al. 2021].
Retargeting is the task of transferring the pose of a source charac-
ter to a target character with a different morphology (bone lengths)
and possibly a different topology (number of joints, connectivity,
etc.) [Gleicher 1998]. Retargeting is a ubiquitous task in animation,
and procedural tools exist for retargeting between skeletons of
different morphologies and topologies [3D 2022].
SMPL and IK There is very little prior work that attempts to use
the IK-enabled SMPL model for 3D character animation. Bebko et al.
[2021] pose SMPL characters in the Unity platform, but do not per-
form any IK. Zhou [2020] performs IK on SMPL parameters using
standard optimization, but only in the full pose context, which has
very limited applicability for artistic pose editing. VPoser [Pavlakos
et al. 2019] trains a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to work as a
prior on 3D human pose obtained from SMPL. This VAE is used as
an iterative IK solver for a pose defined via keypoints. However,
the VPoser architecture only works with relatively dense positional
inputs (no ability to handle sparse heterogeneous effector scenarios
has been demonstrated). It also requires on-line L-BFGS optimiza-
tion, making it too rigid and computationally expensive for pose
authoring. There is a clear gap between SMPL and IK: existing IK
models suitable for artistic pose editing do not support SMPL, and
existing SMPL-based models have insufficient IK cababilities.

3 SMPL-IK
We propose SMPL-IK, a learned morphology-aware inverse kine-
matics module that accounts for SMPL shape and gender infor-
mation to compute the full pose including the root joint position
and 3D rotations of all SMPL joints based on a partially-defined
pose specified by SMPL 𝛽-parameters (body shape), gender flag,
and a few input effectors (positions, rotations, or look-at targets).
SMPL-IK supports effector combinations of arbitrary number and
type. SMPL-IK extends the learned inverse kinematics model Pro-
toRes [Oreshkin et al. 2021]. ProtoRes only deals with a fixed mor-
phology scenario in which an ML-based IK model is trained on
a fixed skeleton. We remove this limitation by conditioning the
ProtoRes computation on the SMPL 𝛽-parameters and gender (see
Appendix F.1 for technical details). This results in an IK model that
can operate on the wide range of morphologies incorporated in the
expansive dataset used to create the SMPL model itself.

There are multiple advantages of this extension, including the
following. First, rich public datasets can be used to train a learned IK
model, in our case we train on the large AMASS dataset [Mahmood
et al. 2019]. Second, an animator can now edit both the pose and the
body shape of a flexible SMPL-based puppet using a state-of-the-
art learned IK tool, which we demonstrate in Appendix A. Third,
training IK in SMPL space unlocks a seamless interface with off-
the-shelf AI algorithms operating in a standardized SMPL space,
such as computer vision pose estimation backbones.

4 SMPL-SI
SMPL-SI maps arbitrary humanoid skeletons onto their SMPL ap-
proximations by learning a mapping from skeleton features to
the corresponding SMPL 𝛽-parameters (solving the inverse shape
problem). Therefore, it can be used to map arbitrary user supplied

skeletons in the SMPL representation and hence integrate SMPL-IK
described above with custom user skeletons. Recall that the SMPL
model implements the following forward equation:

p = SMPL(𝛽, 𝜃 ),

(1)

mapping shape parameters 𝛽 ∈ R10 and pose angles 𝜃 ∈ R22×3
into positions p ∈ R24×3 of SMPL joints. Datasets such as H36M
contain multiple tuples (p𝑖, 𝛽𝑖, 𝜃𝑖 ). In principle, the pairs of H36M’s
skeleton features f𝑖 extracted from (p𝑖, 𝜃𝑖 ) and corresponding labels
𝛽𝑖 , could be used for training a shape inversion model:

ˆ𝛽 = SMPL-SI(f).

(2)

However, the H36M training set contains only 6 subjects, meaning
that the entire dataset contains only 6 distinct vectors 𝛽𝑖 , which is
unlikely to be sufficient for learning any meaningful SMPL-SI.

Taking this into account, we propose to train the SMPL-SI model
as follows. We randomly sample 20k tuples (p𝑖, 𝛽𝑖 ) with (cid:101)𝛽𝑖 = [𝜖𝑖, 𝑠𝑖 ],
where 𝜖𝑖 ∈ R10 is a sample from uniform distribution U (−5, 5) and
𝑠𝑖 ∈ R is the scale sampled from U (0.2, 2). Scale 𝑠𝑖 accounts for the
fact that the actual user supplied characters may have much smaller
or much larger overall scale than the standard SMPL model. Fur-
thermore, we use the SMPL forward equation (1) to compute joint
positions (cid:101)p𝑖 corresponding to (cid:101)𝛽𝑖 and 𝜃𝑖 set to the T-pose. Finally, we
compute skeleton features (cid:101)f𝑖 for each (cid:101)p𝑖 as distances between the
following pairs of joints: (right hip, right knee), (right knee, right
ankle), (head, right ankle), (head, right wrist), (right shoulder, right
elbow), (right elbow, right wrist). Given the 20k samples from the
SMPL model and the features of the user skeleton f, we implement
the kernel density estimator for the shape parameters of the SMPL
model approximating the user supplied skeleton:

∑︁

ˆ𝛽 =

𝑖

(cid:101)𝛽𝑖𝑤𝑖
(cid:205)𝑗 𝑤 𝑗

, 𝑤𝑖 = k((f − (cid:101)f𝑖 )/ℎ).

(3)

Here k is the Gaussian kernel of width ℎ = 0.02. The theory behind
this implementation is that in general, for each skeleton, character-
ized e.g. by its bone lengths, there exist multiple equally plausible
𝛽’s (not surprisingly SMPL-SI is an ill-defined problem, like many
other inverse problems). Therefore, a point solution of the inverse
problem is likely to be degenerate. To resolve this, we formulate the
general solution in probabilistic Bayesian terms, based on 𝑝 ( (cid:101)𝛽, f),
the joint generative distribution of skeleton shape and features. The
corresponding posterior distribution of 𝛽 parameters given features

gives rise to the following Bayesian 𝛽-estimator:

∫

ˆ𝛽 =

(cid:101)𝛽𝑝 ( (cid:101)𝛽 |f)𝑑 (cid:101)𝛽,

(4)

Note that ˆ𝛽 mixes a few likely values of (cid:101)𝛽 corresponding to posterior
distribution modes. Decomposing 𝑝 ( (cid:101)𝛽, f) = 𝑝 (f | (cid:101)𝛽)𝑝 ( (cid:101)𝛽) we get:

ˆ𝛽 =

∫ (cid:101)𝛽𝑝 (f | (cid:101)𝛽)𝑝 ( (cid:101)𝛽)𝑑 (cid:101)𝛽
.
∫ 𝑝 (f | (cid:101)𝛽)𝑝 ( (cid:101)𝛽)𝑑 (cid:101)𝛽

(5)

Since the joint distribution 𝑝 ( (cid:101)𝛽, f) is unknown, we approximate
it using a combination of kernel density estimation and Monte-
Carlo sampling. Assuming conservative uniform prior for 𝑝 ( (cid:101)𝛽), we
sample 𝛽 as described above and we use a kernel density estimator
(cid:205)𝑖 k( f−(cid:101)f𝑖
𝑝 (f | (cid:101)𝛽) ≈ 1
ℎ ). Using this in (5) together with Monte-
ℎ𝑁
Carlo sampling from 𝑝 ( (cid:101)𝛽), results in (3).

5 PROPOSED AI DRIVEN WORKFLOW
Figure 1 presents a high-level summary of the proposed artistic
workflow for 3D scene authoring from an image, while Fig. 2 pro-
vides the detailed overview of how it is implemented for a user-
defined humanoid character. Appendices A, C and B depict simpler
workflows for authoring SMPL poses, image labeling in the SMPL
space and authoring poses on custom characters from scratch. These
were implemented in the 3D real-time Unity engine for validation.
These workflows leverage SMPL-IK and SMPL-SI building blocks
as well as some others described in the rest of this section.

3D Scene From Image. We propose to process a monocular
RGB image to initialize an editable 3D scene as shown in Fig. 1.
A few methods exist for pose estimation from RGB inputs, most
recent of which include ROMP [Sun et al. 2021] and HybrIK [Li
et al. 2021]. In our approach, we use a pre-trained ROMP model that
predicts shape, 3D joint rotations and 3D root joint location for each
human instance in the image. The outputs of pose estimation can be
directly used to edit the estimated 3D SMPL mesh using SMPL-IK,
leading to advanced 3D labelling tools that can be used to refine
pose estimation and augmented reality datasets, as described in
Appendix B. Alternatively, pose estimation results can be retargeted
to user-supplied 3D characters. In which case, the 3D scene with
retargeted characters is further edited through the combination of
SMPL-IK and SMPL-SI as explained below.

Custom Characters. Pose estimation algorithms output pose in
the standardized SMPL space, whereas users may wish to repurpose

In Table 1, we report pose reconstruction errors of our SMPL-IK
approach for two datasets : AMASS [Mahmood et al. 2019] and
Human3.6M [Ionescu et al. 2014] (see Appendix F.2 for more details).

the pose towards their own custom character. We use SMPL-SI to
find the best approximation of the custom character by estimating
its corresponding SMPL 𝛽 parameters from the custom skeleton
features (e.g. certain bone lengths). The SMPL character created
using SMPL-SI provides a good approximation of the user character
hence providing for its smooth integration with SMPL-IK, operating
in the standard SMPL space.

Retargeting. In Figure 2, procedural retargeting first retargets
the initial pose estimation result onto the SMPL approximation of
the user-defined character obtained via SMPL-SI. Second, it retar-
gets the pose edited by the animator with SMPL-IK back on the user
character. On both occasions, SMPL-SI makes the job of procedural
retargeting easier. First, it aligns the topology of user character with
the SMPL space. Second, the SMPL character derived via SMPL-SI is
a close approximation of the user character, simplifying the transfer
of the pose edited with SMPL-IK back onto the user character.

Effector Recovery. Pose estimation outputs a full pose (24 3D
joint angles and 3D root joint location) of each human in the scene.
The pose editing process constrained by this information would be
very tedious. SMPL-IK makes pose authoring efficient using very
sparse constraints (e.g. using 5-6 effectors). Therefore, we propose
to extract only a few effectors to create an editable initial pose. We
call this Effector Recovery, which proceeds starting from an empty
set of effectors, given the full pose provided by the computer vi-
sion backbone, in an iterative greedy fashion. Out of the remaining
effectors, we add one at a time, run a new candidate effector config-
uration through SMPL-IK, and obtain the pose reconstructed from
this configuration. We then choose a new effector configuration
by retaining the candidate effector set that minimizes the L2 joint
reconstruction error in the character space. We repeat this process
until either the maximum number of allowed effectors is reached,
or the reconstruction error falls below a fixed threshold. We find
this greedy algorithm very effective in producing a minimalistic
set of effectors most useful in retaining the initial pose, which is
shown in supplementary video discussed in Appendix D.

Pose Editing. Pose editing relies on the Unity UX integration of
SMPL-IK similar to one of ProtoRes and augmented with the SMPL
shape editing controls as well as pose estimation, SMPL-SI, retar-
geting and effector recovery integrations. Editing happens directly
in the user character space following the WYSIWYG paradigm. A
full pipeline demo is presented in Appendix E.

7 LIMITATIONS
SMPL-IK and SMPL-SI are most effective when dealing with realis-
tic human shapes and poses, because they are trained on the SMPL
model and realistic 3D pose data from the AMASS dataset [Mah-
mood et al. 2019]. Obviously, they perform worse when dealing
with unrealistic and disproportionate human body types, such as
those of certain cartoon characters. SMPL-SI relies on a set of joints
to compute user character features. These joints are present in most
characters, but without them its operation is not viable.

important for representing a believable naturally looking pose [Ore-
shkin et al. 2021]. SMPL-IK can be used as a labeling tool to add
the missing 3D-rotation information to existing datasets, elevat-
ing them to the next level with minimal human effort. Given an
image of a human, our SMPL-IK approach (combined with an off-
the-shelf image-to-pose estimator) provides an editable 3D SMPL
model in a pose close to the one in the image (see Fig. 4). The la-
beling tool based on SMPL-IK and its integration with Unity can
be used to correct the joint rotations and specify the correct lookat
(head/eyes direction) that is most often estimated incorrectly by
the current SOTA pose estimation algorithms due to the absence of
this information in the current pose estimation datasets.

modifying the SMPL 𝛽 shape parameters.

This is shown in the supplementary video Demo_Pose_and_
Shape_Editing.mp4. Compared to ProtoRes, SMPL-IK adds the addi-
tional flexibility of editing body shape together with pose. Figure 3
demonstrates the user interface of shape editing, including the
gender setting and the controls for the 10 SMPL 𝛽 parameters. In
addition, the demo video shows how pose and shape of the SMPL
character can be edited simultaneously. In this video, we demon-
strate the benefit of SMPL-IK in pose authoring. First, we show how
different effectors can be successfully manipulated using SMPL-IK
leading to different realistic poses of the same body. Then, we show
how changing body type, described by gender and scale, leads to
different realistic versions of the same pose for different bodies.
Finally, we show fine-grained modification of the body type by ma-
nipulating the SMPL shape parameters of the body. At every step,
the corresponding pose is estimated using our SMPL-IK approach.

based on real data is that only 3D or 2D positions of joints are
actually labeled. However, it was shown that rotations are very

Figure 5 depicts the simplified workflow that is used for author-
ing a pose for the custom user defined character using a combination
of SMPL-IK and SMPL-SI. Supplementary videos Demo_Authoring_

4 custom characters (child, female, male and strong male) with
different proportions and morphologies.

D EFFECTOR RECOVERY
Supplementary video Demo_Effector_Recovery.mp4 demonstrates
the effector recovery mechanism in action. It shows the effect of
changing the maximum number of effectors hyperparameter as
well as the effect of changing number of recovered effectors on the
initial pose extracted from image. It is clear that a relatively small
number of effectors are sufficient to recover a good initialization
for the editable pose.

E FULL PIPELINE DEMO
E.1 Demo_Crouch_FineTuning.mp4
In this video, we show how to edit a pose in Unity using our ap-
proach. First, given a user-provided 3D character, SMPL-SI is used
to estimate the SMPL body shape parameters that best fit the char-
acter. This SMPL-Character is shown in the video transparently
along with the 3D character, and is also shown in the second image
in Appendix C. Then, given an image of a human in a pose, such as

tern follow H36M Protocol 2 (subjects S1, S5, S6, S7, S8 for train-
ing and S9, S11 for test, plus 1:10 subsampling of the training set)
and AMASS train/validation/test splits from [Mahmood et al. 2019]
(valdation datasets: HumanEva, MPI_HDM05, SFU, MPI_mosh; test
datasets: Transitions_mocap, SSM_synced; training datasets: every-
thing else).

To quantify SMPL-IK, we choose to use evaluation metrics com-
monly used in the context of H36M and AMASS datasets, MPJPE
and PA-MPJPE plus the geodesic rotation error, which was shown
to be important in quantifying the quality of realistic poses in [Ore-
shkin et al. 2021]. The metrics are defined as follows.

GE, geodesic error, between a rotation matrix R and its prediction

MPJPE, mean per joint position error, is computed by flattening all
poses and joints in the batch into the leading dimension resulting
in the ground truth tensor p ∈ R𝑁 ×3 and its prediction (cid:98)p:

PA-MPJPE, Procrustes aligned MPJPE, is MPJPE calculated after
each estimated 3D pose in the batch is aligned to its respective
ground truth by the Procrustes method, which is simply a similarity
transformation.

All metrics in Table 1 are computed on test sets of AMASS
and H36M using models trained on respective training sets us-
ing the randomized effector benchmark framework described in
detail in [Oreshkin et al. 2021].

the crouched baby in Appendix B, an off-the-shelf image-to-pose
estimator is used to obtain its SMPL pose parameters. Then, the
SMPL-Character is retargeted onto the estimated pose. Next, for fur-
ther editing of the character from the new pose, Effector Recovery
is performed to recover the best effectors that describe that pose for
that character. The effectors are shown in purple. These effectors
can now be used to edit the pose as the user wishes. Optionally,
more effectors could be activated for further fine-tuned editing,
including both positional and rotational effectors.

E.2 Demo_Sitting_Editing.mp4
In this video, we demonstrate the case shown in the teaser image,
with two humanoid 3D characters. As image of two people sitting is
loaded, the poses of the two people are estimated using an off-the-
shelf image-to-pose model, and the two 3D characters are retargeted
to these estimated poses. Further, the pose of the 3D characters
are then edited by manipulating the effectors. The video shows
the various effectors and the effect of manipulating them. Every
manipulation uses our SMPL-IK approach to estimate the realistic
pose of that character.

F.2 SMPL-IK Training and Evaluation Details
The training process overall follows that of ProtoRes [Oreshkin
et al. 2021]. We found that naively training on AMASS works well,
while for H36M, simply training on its 6 subjects results in the lack
of generalization in the 𝛽 subspace of inputs. To overcome this,
we used the following 𝛽 augmentation strategy. For each sample
drawn from the H36M dataset we added white Gaussian noise
with unit variance and recalculated joint positions based on the
augmented value of 𝛽 and the pose 𝜃 from the dataset. The model
was trained on the augmented H36M dataset. We found that overall,
the qualitative model quality was better when it was trained on the
AMASS dataset, although the quality of the H36M model was also
acceptable.

To measure quantitative generalization results, we used H36M
train and test splits derived in ROMP [Sun et al. 2021], which in
