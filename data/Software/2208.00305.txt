Abstract. Background: Open Government Data (OGD) is an impor-
tant driver for open innovation, improved eﬃciency, and transparency for
public entities. However, extant research highlights a need for improved
feedback loops, collaboration, and a more demand-driven publication of
OGD.
Objective: Our objective is to explore how public entities in the role
of platform providers can address this issue by enabling collaboration
within their OGD ecosystems, both in terms of the OGD published on
the underpinning platform, as well as any related Open Source Software
(OSS) and standards. Method: We conducted an exploratory multiple-
case study of four OGD ecosystems with diverse characteristics. Data
was collected through semi-structured interviews, and in one of the cases
through a prolonged engagement. The data was then coded using a set of
apriori codes. Results: The study descriptively presents each case based
on the coding, along with synthesis in the form of a conceptual model
that highlights diﬀerent attributes of OGD ecosystems. For example, we
observe how collaboration can be enabled through diﬀerent types of own-
ership of the platform provider, how the ecosystem’s scope can vary, what
roles the platform provider may undertake, how to enable open collabora-
tion, and how to collaborate in terms of data sharing, OSS development,
and standards. For each aspect, we provide recommendations based on
the explored cases that, together with the model, may help public en-
tities in designing and orchestrating new or existing OGD ecosystems.
Conclusions: We conclude that enabling and facilitating collaboration
in an OGD ecosystem is a complex exercise, yet believe that it oﬀers
new ways for public entities in how they can leverage the power of open
innovation to address their goals and directives.

Introduction

Rich and high-quality data have over time become a critical asset for software
organizations as a driver for innovation and input to solutions including artiﬁcial
intelligence [11, 27]. One way of increasing access and availability of such data is

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

J. Lin˚aker and P. Runeson

to share it as Open Data [2] and collaborate on its collection and maintenance
as commonly done with Open Source Software (OSS) [28]. Such sharing of data
is less common within the software industry [36], but more so among public en-
tities [38]. In the latter case, we refer to the openly shared data as Open Govern-
ment Data (OGD) [2]. More speciﬁcally, we consider OGD as “. . . government-
related data that is made open to the public” [2] and thereby a subset of Open
Data.

To enable the potential innovation output from OGD [20, 22], public entities
along with cross-sector organizations and citizens may form OGD ecosystems.
These function as value networks through which the OGD is enriched and used
as input to new or improved products and services [25, 41]. The interaction and
collaboration in these ecosystems are however often quite limited [6,16,29], even
though it is highlighted as a need [35, 39] and implicit characteristics of a data
ecosystem [31].

Considering OSS ecosystems (commonly referred to as communities) [10],
open collaboration on the underpinning OSS projects is common practice. By
working together in an open, transparent, and egalitarian manner [9], new func-
tionality is continuously asserted, discussed, and implemented [8], thereby ac-
celerating the innovation and development beyond what any single actor within
the ecosystem could perform alone [28].

OGD ecosystems may, potentially, have an opportunity to improve the inno-
vation output and enable further value creation by adopting such practices [24].
Also, considering open data ecosystems, such as OpenStreetMap1 and Wiki-
data2, there may also be a potential for catalyzing both the sharing and adoption
of OGD by extending collaboration to include open development of boundary
resources [5] such as related standards and software as OSS [16,34,41]. As we con-
sider current deﬁnitions of data ecosystems [31] (including related concepts [40])
lacking in terms of these characteristics, we deﬁne a data ecosystem, adapted
from three sources [18, 31, 41], as:

a networked community of actors (organizations and individuals), which
base their relations to each other on a common interest [41], supported by an
underpinning technological platform [18] that enables actors to process data (for
example, ﬁnd, archive, publish, consume, or reuse) as well as to foster innova-
tion, create value, or support new businesses [31]. Actors collaborate on the
data and boundary resources (for example, software and standards), through the
exchange of information, resources, and artifacts [18].

For OGD ecosystems speciﬁcally, the provider of the technological platform is
constituted by a public entity (or part of one). Further, we consider any data as
OGD, which is published by the public entity constituting the platform provider,
whether it is produced by the public entity itself, or collected from or shared by
an actor within the ecosystem. These actors may, for example, include public
entities, ﬁrms, non-proﬁt organizations, research institutions, and citizens.

How to Enable Collaboration in Open Government Data Ecosystems

Existing research has mainly focused on the collaborative practices used in
OSS ecosystems [1, 18], and has in terms of OGD ecosystems [2] (and similar
concepts [40]) been limited, both regarding collaboration on OGD or any related
software or standard, even though identiﬁed as a need [31, 35, 39]. The research
goal of this study is therefore to explore how public entities in the role of platform
providers can enable collaboration within their OGD ecosystems, both in terms of
the OGD published on the underpinning platform, as well as any related boundary
resources in the form of OSS and standards.

We take the perspective of the public entity constituting the platform provider
as these manage the platform and the ecosystem around it. The platform provider
lays out the development direction of the platform, decides what is shared, and
establishes the governance structure [3], i.e., rules and processes for how the
ecosystem can inﬂuence and collaborate on the development and any shared
resources (for example, data, software, or standards). We ﬁnd this as an inter-
esting perspective as trust towards the platform provider is pivotal to enable
collaboration and growth of an ecosystem [4, 40].

To address the goal of this study, we conducted a multiple-case study [37] of
four OGD ecosystems in which OSS, standards, and related collaborative prac-
tices are adopted, aiming to foster collaboration and increase the adoption of
OGD. This is an extension of our previous work [23] where we reported on ﬁnd-
ings related to two of the four cases presented in this paper. The four ecosystems
are governed by public entities in the role of platform providers and focus on
OGD related to the labor market in Sweden, public transport in Sweden, and
the region of Helsinki in Finland, as well as the City of Chicago, Illinois, USA.
Based on our ﬁndings we synthesize and present a conceptual model that de-
scribes how OGD ecosystems may vary in terms of diﬀerent aspects, for example
including, platform ownership and scope, as well as sharing and collaboration
practices. For each aspect, we provide recommendations based on the explored
cases that, along with the conceptual model, may help public entities in design-
ing and orchestrating new or existing OGD ecosystems with the ambition to
enable collaboration with and within the ecosystems.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we provide a
background on software and OGD ecosystems and their governance structures.
In section 3 we present our research design, followed by the descriptive results
from our case studies in section 4. In section 5, we present and discuss our
synthesis from the case studies in the form of a conceptual model along with a
number of recommendations. Finally, we summarize and conclude the paper in
section 6.

2 Background

The frame of our analysis and discussion of the studied cases is set by litera-
ture on software and data ecosystems, and particularly their organizational and
governance structures, as outlined below.

2.1 Software and Data Ecosystems

Stemming from the literature on business and digital ecosystems [15, 19, 31],
software and data ecosystems share a common background, yet they diﬀerentiate
in many ways.

Software Ecosystems [1, 18] oﬀer a lens for analyzing how networked com-
munities of organizations collaborate around their common interest in a central
software technology [26]. The central software technology, commonly referred to
as a platform [19], can be viewed as a “foundation technology or set of compo-
nents used beyond a single ﬁrm and that brings multiple parties together for a
common purpose or to solve a common problem” [12]. The platform provider
enables the ecosystem to use and extend the functionalities of the underpinning
platform by providing boundary resources, i.e., “the software tools and regula-
tions that serve as the interface for the arm’s-length relationship between the
platform owner and the application developer.” [13] Such resources can be of
both technical (for example, API:s, developer tools, and libraries) and social
character (for example, documentation, forums, and hackathons) [5].

A Data Ecosystem is deﬁned by Oliveira et al. [31] as a “socio-technical com-
plex network in which actors interact and collaborate with each other to ﬁnd,
archive, publish, consume, or reuse data as well as to foster innovation, create
value, and support new businesses. When comparing the deﬁnitions of software
and data ecosystems [19,31], similar characteristics can be recognized, for exam-
ple, in terms of actors, their relationships, as well as use, sharing, and collabora-
tion of common resources [31]. One diﬀerence however is that this deﬁnition of
a data ecosystem lacks the mentioning of an explicit underpinning technological
platform and any associated boundary resources. This observation further adds
to other deﬁnitions of data ecosystems surveyed by Oliveira et al. [31].

Instead of software platforms, the focus in data ecosystems is rather on the
ﬂow of data between the actors in the ecosystem in the form of a value-chain [25].
A general distinction between the roles in such value-chains can be made be-
tween data providers and data users [41]. The roles can be further reﬁned into
data providers, service providers, data brokers, application developers, applica-
tion users, and infrastructure and tool providers [16, 21]. The data provider is
usually constituted by a public-sector organization [31] as data sharing from
private actors is not as widespread [36]. Services or functions needed include
an infrastructure to share the data (preferably from multiple providers), docu-
mentation, tools for application developers, help in ﬁnding use-cases, as well as
the possibility to discuss, provide feedback and make requests [6, 16, 41]. Several
researchers observe the need for improved feedback-loops, collaboration, and a
more demand-driven publication of OGD [6, 29, 35, 41].

In this study, we introduce an adapted deﬁnition of a data ecosystem (see
section 1) where we explicitly highlight the presence of an underpinning tech-
nological platform as well as associated boundary resources. Considering the
deﬁnition of a platform by Gawer and Cusumano [12], we consider the platform
as the technological mean that in part or full enables the ecosystem’s actors to
process data (for example, ﬁnd, archive, publish, consume, or reuse) as well as to

How to Enable Collaboration in Open Government Data Ecosystems

foster innovation, create value, or support new businesses, inspired by Oliveira
et al. [31]. With the deﬁnition, we also look speciﬁcally at Open Government
Data (OGD) ecosystems, i.e., data ecosystems with a public actor (or part of
one) providing a platform for sharing OGD [2].

2.2 Ecosystem Organizational and Governance Structures

OGD ecosystems are typically centered around “government organizations as
central actors, taking the initiative within networked systems organized to achieve
speciﬁc goals related to innovation and good government” [14]. Oliveira et al. [31]
propose a classiﬁcation of ecosystems’ organizational structures, two of which
highlight the position of the platform provider, either as an orchestrator and
main data provider of the ecosystem, or more limited as an intermediary between
data producers and users of the ecosystem.

Considering software ecosystems speciﬁcally with the deﬁnition by Jansen et
al. [19], these structures blend and overlap. Dal Bianco et al. [5] mainly diﬀeren-
tiate between two organizational structures; keystone-centric ecosystems where
the platform is controlled by a central independent organization, and consortium-
based ecosystems where the central organization is created and co-owned by the
ecosystem’s members.

Looking further, three types of roles are commonly referred to [15, 18]. The
ﬁrst role is that of the platform provider who is the owner and supplier of the
platform and thereby also usually the orchestrator of the ecosystem. As an or-
chestrator, the platform provider also decides on the governance model for the
ecosystem, meaning how it maintains control and decides on the direction, but
also on the governance structure, meaning “the distribution of rights and respon-
sibilities among the [ecosystem’s members], and the rules and protocols that need
to be followed to make decisions regarding the [ecosystem]” [1].

Keystone and niche players are two other roles within an ecosystem. A key-
stone is an actor who nurtures a symbiotic relationship with the ecosystem and
its other actors, looking to actively improve its health [17]. Usually, they have
a close connection with the platform provider, who also may be referred to as
a keystone if it has similar symbiotic intents. Niche players are actors focused
more on a speciﬁc niche of the market, or use-case, and is primarily a user of
the resources provided by the ecosystem [15].

For OSS ecosystems, the platform provider can be the owner of the OSS
project, usually either a software vendor or the ecosystem of actors directly or
via a proxy organization (for example, a foundation) [32]. Governance, however,
does not have to be aligned with the ownership. In more autocratic ecosystems,
it can be centered around a vendor or an individual, while in more democratic
ecosystems it is distributed [7]. In the latter case, control of the OSS project is
usually maintained by a central group of actors who have gained a level of inﬂu-
ence by proving merit, building trust, and social capital through contributions
to the OSS project.

3 Research Design

This study presents an exploratory multiple-case study [37] that we conducted
to investigate four instances of OGD ecosystems, see Table 1. Case 1 (JobTech
Dev) was selected due to the ﬁrst author’s prolonged engagement in its platform
provider. Cases 2–3 (Traﬁklab and HSL DevCom) were selected due to their
characteristics as what we consider as mature examples of OGD ecosystems
(based on our provided deﬁnition), but also due to their Nordic context where
the government has a central role and high level of trust. Case 4 (The City
of Chicago) was selected purposely to get an ecosystem with a general domain
(municipality) compared to the other examples of labour market and public
transport, and also to provide an example beyond the Nordic context.

The actors in the four ecosystems involves organizations and individuals from
both public and private sectors, civic society, academia, and private citizens. The
unit of analysis is the ecosystems’ collaboration around OGD published on the
ecosystems’ underpinning platforms along with any related OSS and standards.

To be able to analyze the collaboration, we used a model from our ear-

ernance. The model is commonly used for describing the governance in OSS
ecosystems [30] and was recently applied to a government-initiated OSS ecosys-
tem [33].

The research eﬀort was initiated with Case 1, where the ﬁrst author of this
study is embedded as an action researcher, as a part of a long-term research
project. The researcher was hence able to generate in-depth knowledge through

prolonged engagement along with access to extensive documentation. The doc-
umentation, ﬁeld notes and three semi-structured interviews are used to trian-
gulate ﬁndings (for questionnaire, see supplementary information3). To ensure
construct validity [37], we based the questionnaire on earlier work about assess-
ing the governance structure of software ecosystems [1,18]. The inteviewees were
the platform’s product owner, community manager, and policy strategist.

Data was gathered from Case 1 before any intervention was introduced from
the action research. To avoid researcher bias, peer-debrieﬁng between the ﬁrst
and second authors was performed continuously [37].

For Cases 2–4, data were also gathered through semi-structured interviews
(see Table 2), using the same questionnaire. All interviews were audio-recorded
with additional notes taken. A threat regarding the reliability concerns that only
the ﬁrst author conducted the interviews [37]. To mitigate the threat, member-
checking was performed in both cases, where synthesized ﬁndings were presented
to all interviewees who were asked for correctness, misinterpretations, and re-
dundancy.

A series of apriori codes were deﬁned based on our deﬁnition of an OGD

ecosystem as presented in Section 1.

Synthesized ﬁndings are presented per case in Section 4 where codes have

been abstracted into the following four categories:

Dev (upper left), Traﬁklab (upper right), HSL DevCom (lower left), and City of
Chicago (lower right), based on the governance model presented in earlier work [23] (in
turn adopted from Nakakoji et al. [30]). The core is occupied by the platform provider
who controls development and data shared on platform. Ecosystem actors are divided
among a number of layers speciﬁc for each ecosystem. Actors important to the platform
provider and ecosystem, and with high inﬂuence on the platform are close to the core.
Inﬂuence and activity decrease for each additional layer. The closer to the core, the
more inﬂuence they have on the platform

– Platform Content (C2–3)
– Ecosystem Governance Structure (C4–C5)
– Orchestration and Collaboration (C6–C8)

Quotes from the interviewees (see table 2) are used to provide further context
and nuance to the ﬁndings. The cases were then cross-analyzed based on the
apriori codes which resulted in a conceptual model of OGD ecosystems. The
model consists of eight aspects, each with a number of attributes, which emerged
from the analysis. The model is visualized is Fig. 2 and presented in detail in
Section 5.

4 Results

This section summarizes the results from the four studied cases, JobTech Dev,
Traﬁklab, HSL DevCom, and the City of Chicago.

4.1 Case 1: JobTech Dev

General Background JobTech Dev is an ecosystem, initiated in 2018, bring-
ing actors together which operate within or in relation to the Swedish labor
market, to collaborate on a common platform of OGD, connected APIs, and
complementary OSS projects. The ecosystem and its platform are developed
and orchestrated by the Swedish Public Employment Service (SPES), a Swedish
national government agency responsible for enabling the match-making between
job-seekers and employers on the labor market. JobTech Dev was created as a
part of this mission to enable the actors in the ecosystem to accelerate their
innovation process, improve their services, and thereby improving the digital
match-making on the labor market.

Platform Content The platform consists of three parts: Jobs, Taxonomy, and
Career.

Jobs is a service intended to collect job advertisements on the Swedish labor
market through a collaboration with several ad providers and make the ads
available through a common API.

Taxonomy is a collection of skills and job titles and relationships between
them. The data set is developed and maintained within SPES. By opening up
the data through APIs, the actors in the ecosystem are enabled to “speak the
same language” enabling, for example, improved reporting and statistics and
match-making between job advertisements and job-seekers’ resumes. The data
is released under the CC0 1.0 license4.

Career is (unlike Taxonomy and Jobs) not OGD. It is a service where job-
seekers can store their resumes on a central location in an encrypted format. The
job-seekers can grant and withdraw permission to organizations, for example, re-
cruitment ﬁrms, social networks, and insurance ﬁrms to access their information.
The service is based on the MyData principles5 and enables job-seekers to only
have to maintain one copy of their resume and to distribute and manage their
data with kept control over their integrity and privacy.

The source code for the APIs is available as OSS as are the algorithms. To
lower adoption barriers to the data, example applications are also developed
and released as OSS. Members consuming the data, speciﬁcally startups, have
acknowledged the value provided by these examples as it helps them understand
use-cases and accelerate their development.

Ecosystem Governance Structure In terms of operations, the members of
the ecosystem can generally be categorized within one of the areas: 1) recruiting
and staﬃng ﬁrms, 2) education and guidance providers, 3) national, regional or
local governments, 4) workers’ unions, 5) employers’ associations, 6) job adver-
tisers, and 7) job seekers. Depending on the category, a member’s interest in the
platform may be limited to certain parts of the platform.

10

J. Lin˚aker and P. Runeson

To visualize the governance structure, we use a governance model presented
in earlier work [23] (in turn adopted from Nakakoji et al. [30]). SPES is posi-
tioned in the center as the platform provider orchestrating and governing the
ecosystem (see Fig. 1, upper left). SPES ultimately decides on requirements and
road-map for the platform, including what data to make available, when, and
how. They perform the necessary development and maintenance and provide the
infrastructure needed to access and use the data.

In the layer closest to SPES are the members whose opinions may be con-
sidered as extra important for SPES in terms of developing the platform and
growing the ecosystem. These members may, for example, have a large user base,
or valuable competencies and resources, and thereby contribute to the health of
the ecosystem. In the second layer are the general members and in layer three
the end-users. Each layer is viewed to potentially consist of members from all
types of operations.

Orchestration and Collaboration Due to the limited internal resources,
SPES cannot maintain formal and direct relationships with all ecosystem mem-
bers. Teams carrying out development inside SPES therefore primarily work and
communicate through close relationships with the key members to optimize the
impact. However, SPES is striving to adopt an open development model and
maintain an open dialogue where the whole ecosystem (including all layers in
Fig 1) can inﬂuence the direction of the platform.

Anyone can, for example, request and discuss a new feature, an API, or
data-set through an asynchronous open communication platform or by attending
occasional meetups arranged by SPES. It is also possible to contribute to the
development, although external contributions so far have been limited to bug
reports and feature requests. The intention however is to encourage and enable
members to contribute both new projects and to exist. Non-code contributions
are however more common, for example, in the form of validating the quality and
performance of the OSS. One example constitutes algorithms used to remove
duplicate job ads as well assign statistical identiﬁers to the job ads that are
collected and then made available through an API. External actors, including
the Swedish statistics agency, have thus been able to test and validate the quality
of the algorithms and whether they can trust the results the algorithms produce.
In terms of data, there are examples – although limited – of members pro-
ducing and contributing directly to the platform. One example is a set of soft
skills and their relationship to diﬀerent job titles, which was contributed to the
Taxonomy part of the platform. Processes are not yet established for how these
types of contributions should be managed. In this case, a formal contract was
established between the two parties.

Close collaborations and direct dialogues with key members have been im-
portant to establish the ecosystem and gain general acceptance. For example, the
collection of all job-ads on the market and making these freely available, made
incumbents oﬀering recruitment and staﬃng services initially question the intent
from SPES as well as the suggested beneﬁts. SPES views the commoditization of

How to Enable Collaboration in Open Government Data Ecosystems

11

job-advertisement data, as with the ecosystem at large, as a way to push the ac-
tors forward who are working with digital match-making and guidance services,
nurturing innovation and lowering barriers to entry for new actors.

After a more than two-year process, even the more conservative incumbents
started to accept the ecosystem and see potential beneﬁts with it. A formal col-
laboration was initiated between SPES and the ten largest job advertisement
providers where they agreed to allow job-advertisements to be collected. Once
collected, the ads are converted to an industry-speciﬁc open standard, and then
enriched with metadata such as date of publishing and deadline for applications.
A compromise was reached to only provide a “stub” of the advertisements, mean-
ing that only that job title, metadata, and a link to the original advertisement
would be provided through the platform’s API.

SPES works actively to adopt or develop open standards when needed to
promote and improve interoperability between the actors in JobTech Dev as well
as towards the outside. One example is the adoption of the HROpen standard6
that was adopted for the way individuals’ resum´e data is distributed. To also
make their MyData-based implementation underpinning the Career-initiative,
they have initiated an collaboration for deﬁning interfaces and API:s within the
MyData community7.

4.2 Case 2: Traﬁklab

General Background Traﬁklab is an ecosystem, initiated in 2011, that brings
actors within the Swedish public transport sector together to collaborate on
a platform with open traﬃc data, connected APIs, and complementary OSS
projects. The ecosystem’s vision is to facilitate the creation of new services that
makes it easier and more attractive to travel with public transport. The ecosys-
tem and its platform are developed and orchestrated by Samtraﬁken, a corporate
entity co-owned by all the regional public transport authorities and most of the
commercial transport operators in Sweden. Operators also have the option of
being partners to Samtraﬁken without being co-owners.

Platform Content The platform consists of data-sets and APIs, either main-
tained by Samtraﬁken or independently by members of the ecosystem. All data
hosted on the Traﬁklab-platform is released with a custom license based on the
principles of the CC0 1.0 license.

Four APIs provide static and real-time data on public transport, related to,
for example, time-tables and interruptions. This data is currently made available
in two types of standard formats, maintained by Samtraﬁken and gathered from
the regional public transport authorities and private operators following a gov-
ernment directive. Two further APIs provide time-table data for a trip-planner,
an externally procured product that “. . . is oﬀered for free as-a-Service” (I4) to
the ecosystem.

J. Lin˚aker and P. Runeson

Certain APIs are maintained by other organizations, both public and pri-
vate, and made available on the Traﬁklab platform. Data includes time-table
and service data from Stockholm Public Transport and traﬃc information from
the Swedish Transport Administration. The platform also links to related APIs
that are maintained and hosted by other organizations. These include data from
regional public transport authorities, local counties, and private entities.

In regards to OSS, they currently have a number of software development
kits and example applications available. They intend to develop a new OSS
trip planner and share their APIs as OSS along with the diﬀerent parts of the
platform.

Ecosystem Governance Structure In terms of operations, the members of
the ecosystem can generally be categorized within one of the areas: 1) regional
public transport authorities, 2) private and publicly owned train operators, 3) na-
tional, regional, and local governments, 4) private bus operators, and 5) private
product and service providers. Plans include integration with related actors, such
as taxi operators and rental-service providers of, for example, cars and bikes.

In terms of the governance structure, Samtraﬁken is positioned in the center
as the platform provider orchestrating and governing the ecosystem (see Fig. 1,
upper right). Outside of Samtraﬁken in the ﬁrst layer are regional public trans-
port authorities. As these are formal owners of the platform, they have a strong
inﬂuence on the direction of Traﬁklab. In the second layer are the formal part-
ners to Samtraﬁken which may include actors with diﬀerent types of operation.
The third layer primarily consists of private product and service providers, while
end-users are positioned in the fourth layer.

Orchestration and Collaboration Close relationships are maintained to re-
gional public transport authorities and partners as these are the primary data
producers but also consumers. The ecosystem at large can report bugs, ask
for help, and request and discuss new features, APIs, or data-sets through an
asynchronous, open communication platform. Physical meetings can also serve
a similar purpose since Samtraﬁken frequently hosts hackathons and meetups
related to Traﬁklab.

As with SPES, Samtraﬁken is transitioning to a more open and collaborative
way of engaging with its ecosystem, a need identiﬁed in earlier research [35].
What they have released thus far has mostly “. . . been sporadic – we need to
have this for that meetup” (I4). I4 adds however, “After this change we will
have a more clear strategy regarding open source, where everything we do will be
available as open source”. One part in this are the “. . . plans to build an open
source journey planner based on the same data as the proprietary version” (I4).
Another part in its adoption of more open and collaborative practices, is Sam-
traﬁken move towards opening up its roadmaps, while also discussing a more
formal approach where users can request and vote on what data sets should be
prioritized. External contributions have thus far been limited to bug reports and
feature requests.

Regarding the data, all of the provided data sets originate from data produc-
ers within the ecosystem. Depending on the case, Samtraﬁken may transform
the data to certain standard formats, develop and maintain the necessary APIs,
and provide the necessary infrastructure for data consumers. A challenge with
growing the ecosystem and gaining new data producers is related to standard
formats of the data. For smaller actors, it is an expensive process to transform
the data, and for Samtraﬁken a recognized risk is that data may be destroyed
when transformed between standards. Samtraﬁken is, therefore “. . . developing
an input-portal to enable actors that do not have the resources or can aﬀord it, to
share their data on Traﬁklab and to automate the transformation process” (I4).
The portal is speciﬁcally intended for actors in areas related to public transport,
such as taxi operators and rental-service providers. The input-portal is a result
of a long-term investigation conducted by Samtraﬁken and its partners into the
future potential and needs for public transport-related OGD. The investigation
also rendered in a plan to introduce 12 new data sets by 2021.

Other than helping data producers to transform their data into diﬀerent
standards (for example, the GTFS format, an industry standard for public trans-
portation schedules and associated geographical information8), Samtraﬁken and
its partners within the Traﬁklab ecosystem also collaborate on the development
of new standards when needed. A standard for tickets and payment transac-
tions was developed “. . . with the goal of enabling sales of tickets across regional
borders which was diﬃcult to solve in existing proprietary solutions” (I4).

4.3 Case 3: HSL Developer Community

General Background HSL Developer Community (HSL DevCom) as an ecosys-
tem was created in 2009 as the ﬁrst data sets were published. However, “. . . the
ecosystem was far from established, for example, we did nothing related to open
source software at this time” (I5). The ecosystem brings together actors with
an interest in OGD and OSS related to the Helsinki region’s public transport
(compared to the national focus in the case of Traﬁklab). The ecosystem and
its platform are developed and orchestrated by the Helsinki Regional Transport
(HSL as per the Finnish translation) authority, a local joint authority co-owned
by nine municipalities in the Helsinki region of Finland. HSL is, among other
things, responsible for the planning and organizing the region’s public transport
system.

Platform Content The platform consists of several data-sets and connected
APIs as well as a number of related OSS projects central to the ecosystem actors,
both in terms of internal operations and as customer-facing applications. All data
is made available under the CC-BY 4.0 license9.

J. Lin˚aker and P. Runeson

The main part of the platform is related to the Journey Planner 10, an OSS
application for travelers planning their journeys within the region’s public trans-
port system. The Journey Planner was HSL’s ﬁrst OSS project piloted in 2013
where the core consists of the Open Trip Planner OSS project. “The user inter-
face we have built ourselves, we use Open Trip Planner for the route planning
and any outward-facing API:s” (I5). The Journey Planner is developed in col-
laboration with the Finnish Transport Agency and Waltti, a public transport
travel card collaboration in Finland. “HSL leads the development while the other
two partners mainly contribute ﬁnancially” (I5). The platform further provides
four underlying open APIs which provide i) itinerary- and timetable data, ii)
geocoding data with addresses and coordinates, iii) route suggestions between
two coordinates, and vi) the underlying map data. The data for i–iii is produced
by HSL while the map data for vi is generated from OpenStreetMap (OSM),
after a number of operations has been performed such as “ﬁltering of the data,
creation of grid patterns, and visualizations using [HSL’s] own map style” (I5).
A second main OSS application, also using the same underlying APIs, is the
Map Generator 11, a web-based tool for generating, for example, route maps,
traﬃc bulletins, and stop posters. The development of the Map Generator is
mainly performed by HSL.

Other APIs that are provided via the platform covers data related to:

– Bluetooth beacons installed on buses, bus stops, and terminals for trains
and subways. One use case is to maintain an overview of the number of
passengers waiting for or currently undergoing a ride. Another use case is
to provide “. . . better information regarding the current ride they are taking,
and provide traﬃc information and potential alternative traveling options”
(I5). The data is produced and published by HSL.

– Trips made with city bikes in Helsinki. The data includes information related
to the trips start and endpoints and is mainly used for analysis. The data is
produced by City Bike Finland and contributed to HSL once a month who
publish it on the platform.

– Car park information of commuters. The data is produced by municipalities
and operators via a browser-based user interface on HSL’s website. The data
is then published on via the API on the platform by HSL.

Ecosystem Governance Structure Similar to Traﬁklab, members of the
ecosystem can in terms of operations generally be categorized as: 1) national,
regional, and local transport authorities 2) and governments, but also 3) private
bus and 4) train operators, and 5) private product and service providers. As the
use of the Journey Planner stretches beyond Finland, members of the ecosys-
tem also cover Norwegian, Swedish, German, and Italian markets (to various
extents).

In terms of the governance structure, HSL is positioned in the center as
the platform provider (see Fig. 1, lower left). Outside in the ﬁrst layer are the

10 https://digitransit.fi/en/

How to Enable Collaboration in Open Government Data Ecosystems

15

nine municipalities that co-own HSL and thereby have the formal ownership of
the platform and a strong inﬂuence on the direction of its development where
“. . . the larger municipalities has a bit more inﬂuence” (I5). In the second layer
are the formal partners to HSL in relation to the Journey Planner, i.e., the
Finnish Transport Agency and Waltti, which help to fund the development and
maintenance of the Journey Planner and its underlying APIs. In the third layer
are the active members of the ecosystem, which primarily include the national
and international users of the Journey Planner, as well as large consumers of the
data APIs such as Google who incorporates it in their search and map products.
In the fourth layer are the more passive private product and service providers,
while end-users are positioned in the ﬁfth layer.

Orchestration and Collaboration HSL has since the launch of the Journey
Planner had an open-by-default perception, that most of what they develop
should be available as OSS. “We had this proprietary solution we needed to
replace, and we had thoughts on that we wanted to try doing it open source and
use OpenStreetMap, then we found the Open Trip Planner project which does
a lot of the things we need” (I5). Hence, the authority has a large set of OSS
projects available on their GitHub account. Among these, it is only the Journey
Planner that beneﬁts from external contributions. Due to deviations in interest
and agendas, there is a branch of the Journey Planner that is being developed
and maintained by the Norwegian Transport Authority. Both sides are however
working towards integrating the two versions of the Journey Planner.

I5 reﬂects that the HSL has generally been focused on the development and
hoped that the external contributions would come automatically with time,
which, according to the interviewee only holds for the Journey Planner OSS
project. However, in an upcoming large development project related to their
master data registry, they have an “. . . ambition to establish a collaboration with
other public transport operators or organizations from start” (I5).

In terms of the OSS projects, there are issue trackers for each speciﬁc project
on GitHub. Bug reports or feature requests are however limited, with the Jour-
ney Planner as an exception. However, there is no general open issue tracker
for the platform and its APIs that is actively used. Instead, the e-mail is the
most common option along with HSL’s social media accounts at Facebook and
Twitter, which can be considered as the main communication channels used
towards the ecosystem at large. They do use Slack, a synchronous communica-
tion platform which, however, is closed and exclusive for the main partners and
international users of the Journey Planner OSS project. Physical meetings are
frequently used to communicate with the ecosystem, present plans, and collect
requirements, typically by speaking at conferences or partnering with external
hackathons.

In terms of data, there is a mix of data produced by HSL (for example,
itinerary- and timetable data, and Bluetooth beacon data), by actors within the
ecosystem (for example, geocode data from national authorities and car park
data from the municipalities), and by ecosystems external to HSL DevCom (for

16

J. Lin˚aker and P. Runeson

example, map data from OpenStreetMap). Some data are automatically collected
such as geocode data from municipalities or map data from OpenStreetMap,
whilst other data may be shared by the ecosystem actor through technical in-
frastructure (car park data) or directly via mail (city bike trips data).

To share maintenance and reduce the amount of internal edits needed, HSL
has a full-time editor and some part-time resources available as needed that con-
tribute to OpenStreetMap. Edits may, for example, include the move or addition
of a bus stop, or the correction of street names. There have been contributions
of larger data sets to OSM as well. These are however limited due to that HSL
considers the current contribution process expensive in terms of resources, and
due to conﬂicting licenses. “We have to provide the national road database with
bus stop data licensed under CC-BY-4.0 and can therefore not base all of our
data on OSM, because that would ”infect” the data we export with OSM’s [ODbL]
license”.

As with Samtraﬁken, HSL promotes the use of the GTFS standard “. . . after
a request from Google, however, it was rather inevitable, as it has become a
de facto format, even though there are other standards used as well” (I5). No
examples were given regarding development of new standards or speciﬁcations
within the ecosystem.

4.4 Case 4: City of Chicago OGD ecosystem

General Background The City of Chicago’s OGD ecosystem was initiated in
2011 through the launch of the city’s open data program and data portal. The
ecosystem at large covers the whole city, including its citizens, NGOs, and com-
panies. The main goal is to make the city’s internal data useful to and consum-
able by the public. The ﬁrst driver of the initiative was to increase transparency,
which with time evolved to a higher focus on enabling social and economic de-
velopment. Another important motive is to engage the public to improve their
community. Citizens with a tech background see it as a way to “pay back to [the]
community and be able to volunteer some of their time by using their skills” (I6).

Platform Content The platform consists of about 1400 diﬀerent data sets
available through API:s. The data springs out of the administrative processes
that are carried out by the City of Chicago. There is hence a wide variety in the
type of data spanning from every permit issued by the city, every crime reported,
to every trip taken via mobility and ride-sharing operators. The most popular
data set however was the “the list of salaries and all the employees who worked
for the city” (I6). The data is released under a custom licence12.

In terms of OSS, the city has about 80 published OSS projects on their
GitHub account, where a smaller number is considered more active and used
than others. A common theme is that there is a connection to the data published
on the city’s data portal. Two of the more popular projects are made up of

12 https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/narr/foia/data_disclaimer.html

How to Enable Collaboration in Open Government Data Ecosystems

17

algorithms, that together with data from the portal, support decisions on where
to send food inspectors in the city, and predicting E. coli levels in Lake Michigan,
respectively. Another project regards OpenGrid 13, a web-based map that allows
the user to explore multiple data sets simultaneously.

Ecosystem Governance Structure The members of the ecosystem surround-
ing the OGD and OSS provided via the city’s platform are cross-sectoral, involv-
ing research institutions, companies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs),
journalists, and citizens. As there is a wide variety in the data sets provided
there is no speciﬁc industry or area to classify these members in as with the
other cases presented in this paper, such as actors connection to the Swedish
labor market as in the case of JobTech Dev.

Considering the governance structure, the city is in the center position of the
governance structure as the platform provider (see Fig. 1, lower right). At the
layers closest, they don’t prioritize certain groups before others (as with SPES
for example) but listen to those actors that are actively communicating and
collaborating with them. A representation can be found among all sectors listed
above. Journalists, for example, is highlighted as one category who often interacts
and requests the release of data sets related to their investigations. NGOs are
another important type of actor as they often interface and reach larger groups
of citizens either in general or around certain topics. Research institutions are
also of importance as they are often part of developing OSS applications and
data science projects using the published data. Certain companies, including
startups and incumbents, may be more vocal than others depending on the their
dependence of the data. Some citizens may also be considered as keystones by
frequently ﬁling public record requests.

As with the other cases, in the layers that follow are the more passive users
of the data, followed by the end-users to the many applications that are created
by the actors in the middle layers.

Orchestration and Collaboration As with HSL, the City of Chicago has ini-
tiated a number of OSS projects that are available on the city’s GitHub account.
Of these, only parts are developed and maintained actively and are getting ex-
ternal contributions. In this open collaboration, research institutions make up
important partners as they in turn are incentivized to collaborate with the gov-
ernment and also share the goals of the city in terms of “creating broad public
value” (I6) through the development of OSS. External grants have been a com-
mon tool to fund this collaboration and thereby the development of OSS projects
such as OpenGrid.

As highlighted in the OpenGrid project, also companies constitute important
partners. Their contributions are in part development procured by the city, but
also come as an eﬀect as companies can oﬀer and sell support for the OSS project
to other customers (which was actively encouraged by the City of Chicago).

J. Lin˚aker and P. Runeson

Another successful project in terms of external contributions is the algorithm
for measuring E. coli levels in Lake Michigan. The project, which was led by
the city with a staﬀ of eight people, received “over a thousand hours of in-kind
contributions” (I6).

For OSS projects that are actively maintained, the city tries to publish both
roadmaps and documentation, and use the collaborative infrastructure oﬀered
by GitHub. I6 describes how they with time have “ﬁgured out what sticks and
then where you actually have to pay your attention to” and also “take lessons
from others and see how other [OSS] projects organize themselves. For prioritized
projects such as OpenGrid, the city organizes public meetings, physically and
virtually, where the city can solicit feedback and present the roadmap so that
“people can contribute to it and in a way that makes sense” (I6). In certain cases,
working committees would be set up to facilitate collaboration around speciﬁc
topics. A common theme among the OSS projects is that they in some way make
use of the data and enable analysis and exploration of it. The city views OSS
as a mechanism for interacting with the citizens around the open data program
and enable them to make use of the data, and also contribute back.

The data shared to large extents originate from within the city. However, it
is not the city’s intention . . . to accumulate all data related to the City of Chicago
(I6). Instead, they try “. . . to be pragmatic, add things of value [and] be able to
meet people’s needs” (I6). Hence, there are in general no speciﬁc domains that
are considered in terms of sharing data. Sometimes there are exceptions when a
speciﬁc initiative is highlighted, like clean energy and sustainability where some
speciﬁc data sets would be released (I6). Not all data originates from within the
city, however. Some data sets are gathered from the national government, such
as census data, population data, and socioeconomic data, and then broken down
into the city’s community areas. Mobility data generated from services such as
taxi, ride-sharing, and bike rental is also collected and published due to legal
requirements.

The city has attempted to collaborate on certain data sets with the public by
publishing the data sets on GitHub, similar to what is done with the source code
in OSS projects. These data sets mainly connected to geographic entities such
as “bike paths, streets, bike racks, [as] these are things very much in the public
where [the citizens] actually might be able to see something and know it before
the government knows about it” (I6). One example of external contributions re-
garded footprints of the city’s buildings. This data set was in turn contributed
by citizens to the OpenStreetMap. Although successful examples, the city did
“not experience GitHub as a good platform for sharing geospatial data and con-
tributing data” (I6) and also as the interest from the public was limited why
they did not pursue this model of collaboration any further beyond the initial
initiatives.

The city uses open standards when possible to enable interoperability be-
tween similar data sets from other cities, for example, through the use of GTFS
related to public transport (similar to Samtraﬁken and HSL) and the Mobility
Data Speciﬁcation related to mobility services. They also engage and co-develop

How to Enable Collaboration in Open Government Data Ecosystems

19

new standards for how to publish data when needed. One example referred to
a collaboration between a number of cities on how to commonly display the
location and availability of ﬂu shots.

5 Analysis and Discussion

JobTech Dev (Case 1), Traﬁklab (Case 2), HSL DevCom (Case 3), and the
City of Chicago (Case 4) present both similar and diﬀerentiating attributes as
OGD ecosystems. In this section, we break these attributes down into several
aspects, together forming a conceptual model emerging from the analysis (see
Fig. 2) along with recommendations for platform providers to consider when
(re)designing their OGD ecosystems to foster collaboration and sharing of re-
sources. Each aspect of the model is explained and contrasted individually below,
highlighting its diﬀerent attributes that were identiﬁed in the four cases.

5.1 Platform Provider and Keystones

Among the studied cases, we observed three diﬀerent types of platform providers
based on the owner(s) it represents; Single-public ownership, Public-private co-
ownership, and Public co-ownership. The single-public ownership is represented
by the case of JobTech Dev and the City of Chicago, which are governed by a
single public entity, namely SPES and the city government, respectively. They
decide who the keystones and main stakeholders are, and how they may inﬂuence
the content and development of the platform (cf. keystone-based governance [5]).
In SPES’ case, they prioritized whom they consider large and important actors,
while the City of Chicago maintains a broader deﬁnition of whom they consider
as keystones. This freedom to choose allows them to potentially move quickly
but also has the risk that their direction can easily change due to change in
the national and local government, respectively. This risk could be a concern
for both existing and new members in whether they can trust the direction and
stability of the platform and ecosystem, and thereby if they should invest in
platform integrations.

The public-private co-ownership model is represented by the case of Traﬁk-
lab, which is governed by Samtraﬁken, an organization co-owned by all the
Swedish public transport authorities along with a number of privately owned
public transport actors. The co-ownership of the platform provider provides a
somewhat neutral body among the public and private actors, whom some may
be considered as competitors. This consortium-based governance structure [5]
may be a way to ensure the critical aspect of trust in the platform provider’s
commitment and a guarantee for the long-term stability and collaboration within
the ecosystem [40]. Similarities may be drawn to the role of data trusts [4] as
well as OSS foundations [7] as proxy-organizations and neutral homes for data
and OSS projects respectively. In these organizations, actors can collaborate and
invest together in a way that beneﬁts them all and with clear charters stating
how the project will be technically governed. A risk with this form of ownership,

21

however, is that the platform provider may not be able to receive government
funding as it would beneﬁt the private actors whom are part of its the ownership
(in contrast to those who are not).

The public co-ownership model is represented by the case of HSL DevCom,
which is governed by the HSL, an organization co-owned by nine out of fourteen
municipalities in the Helsinki Region. The remaining ﬁve have the option to join
the collaboration should they prefer. This model allows for the municipalities
to collaborate, as with Traﬁklab, through a consortium-based governance struc-
ture [5] and also provide joint services and operations that are speciﬁc to their
assignments as public entities.

Recommendations: Based on the studied cases, we advice public entities act-
ing as platform providers in an OGD ecosystem to:

– consider how to best enable collaboration and engagement from keystone
players in the ecosystem through platform ownership. If the role of platform
provider is concentrated to a single public entity (single-public ownership), it
needs to enable dialogue and inﬂuence from keystones, for example, through
an open collaboration. If ownership is distributed among the keystones, for
example, a number of public entities (public co-ownership), or a number
of public and private entities in collaboration (public-private co-ownership),
collaboration may be ensured through formal organizational structures.
– identify and build trustful relationships with the keystones of the ecosystem
as their engagement and success is important for the overall health and
success of the ecosystem. What actors that constitute keystone will vary,
but may include owners, partners, organizations with large user bases or
other types of valuable assets, citizens, or general cross-sector organizations.

5.2 Scope of Ecosystem

The ecosystem can cover diﬀerent scopes, both in terms of geographical and
demographic coverage. The scope is in part deﬁned by the platform provider who
creates, governs, and facilitates the ecosystem. They set the vision and focus for
the platform, and use cases it should address [15]. Returning to our deﬁnition
of an OGD ecosystem (see Section 1), this connects to the common interest
on which actors base their relationships. Continuing from this perspective, the
scope is also partly deﬁned by the actors who join, since without them there is
no ecosystem. The vision and scope of the ecosystem is therefore something that
potentially evolves organically with time.

Looking at geographical coverage, we can notice that JobTech Dev and
Traﬁklab have national coverage of Sweden, while HSL DevCom and the City
of Chicago have a more regional and municipal coverage on the municipal gov-
ernment. However, even though the main actors may be limited geographically,
the same limitations do not have to concern all actors within the ecosystem. In
the case of HSL DevCom, Google and Apple, for example, are interested in the
public transport on a global level, not just in the Helsinki region in Finland.

22

J. Lin˚aker and P. Runeson

Considering the demographic coverage, Traﬁklab, HSL DevCom, and JobTech
Dev have a sector-speciﬁc focus on public transport and the Swedish labor mar-
ket, respectively. However, even though the data may be limited, use cases don’t
have to be. These can be generic or positioned in a separate domain where the
data from the concerned platform is only one piece of the puzzle. In contrast,
the City of Chicago has a very general focus in terms of its ecosystem as the
OGD and OSS they provide may relate to any part of the city’s many services
and functions.

Recommendation: Based on the studied cases, we advice public entities acting
as platform providers in an OGD ecosystem to:

– maintain a clear vision for the ecosystem, but at the same time allow for
the ecosystem’s actors to inﬂuence and buy in on the vision. It is important
to also consider actors whose use case may stretch beyond the intended
geographical and demographic coverage of the ecosystem.

5.3 Platform Provider’s Functions

Looking at the functions, or responsibilities taken on by the platform providers
in the investigated ecosystems, they cover many of the roles as reported in the
literature [16, 25]. Besides being data providers, all four platform providers may
be described as data brokers as they gather, promote, and distribute data from
third-party [16] (cf. data intermediaries [40]), but also data transformers as they
transform data between diﬀerent standards based on ecosystem needs [25]. An
example of the latter can be found in the case of Traﬁklab where Samtraﬁken
transforms incoming data to the GTFS format.

Another important role that all platform providers take on is that of tool
and infrastructure providers as they develop supporting tools, frameworks, and
example applications for their ecosystems, as well as infrastructure to enable
collection and distribution of the data [16].

Furthermore, all four platform providers also take on the role of service
providers as they to diﬀerent extent provide services based on the data they
publish. As examples, both HSL and Samtraﬁken both provide their respective
journey planners, the City of Chicago provides OpenGrid as a service to allow
users to explore the OGD published on their data portal, and SPES enables
individuals to store and distribute their resum´e-data to recruitment platforms
via their Career initiative. In the case of HSL and the City of Chicago, they
also take on the role of application developers as they develop and provide the
applications (on which they base their services) as OSS.

Hence, to stimulate and enable collaboration in OGD ecosystems, the plat-
form provider is required to perform multiple functions, which otherwise may
be divided among multiple actors [16, 25]. In contrast, when entering an exist-
ing ecosystem, an organization may consider taking a peripheral, less complex
role [35]. This is, however, a trade-oﬀ between inﬂuence on the platform devel-
opment and value capture, i.e., if the organization’s goals can still be achieved.

How to Enable Collaboration in Open Government Data Ecosystems

23

Recommendation: Based on the studied cases, we advice public entities acting
as platform providers in an OGD ecosystem to:

– consider the needs of the ecosystem’s actors and take on an active and multi-
functional role in order to stimulate and enable collaboration in the ecosys-
tem. Such functions may include providing and brokering data between ac-
tors, as well as providing tools and infrastructure for adopting and processing
the data, and related services and applications to enable use cases involving
the data.

5.4 Open Collaboration

To enable an open collaboration within the ecosystem [24], the platform provider
itself needs to open up their processes and communication for the ecosystem
using appropriate social and technical boundary resources [5, 13].

Open communication channels is one example of such resources through
which the platform provider and ecosystem actors can collaborate and commu-
nicate with each other [9]. All four platform providers have such channels, either
synchronous or asynchronous, complemented with alternative channels such as
email, social media, and support desks. These channels usually serve as places
for posting questions, asking for support but also reporting bugs, and requesting
new functionality or data.

Open requirements management is another key boundary resource that in-
cludes openly communicating what requirements that the provider is working
on [8]. It also involves enabling ecosystem actors to comment as well as request
features more formally, for example, through an issue tracker rather than the
communication channels. None of the ecosystems has a central issue tracker
but use those available via GitHub in connection to the OSS projects. In terms
of communicating more long-term plans, only the City of Chicago publishes
roadmaps related to their OSS projects.

Active ecosystem engagement is the third type of social boundary resource,
meaning that the platform providers need to communicate actively with their
ecosystem actors, and also engage, initiate and facilitate collaborations within
the ecosystem [24]. Beyond using the open communication channels, physical and
virtual meetings such as hackathons, meetups, and conferences are commonly
used among all the platform providers. This aspect is especially important before
releasing a new data set or OSS project. For example, HSL reported struggles
with gaining contributions as they have been too focused on the development
and less on external engagement. As a counter-example one can consider the
work that SPES has put into preparing the job-ad collaboration.

Recommendation: Based on the studied cases, we advice public entities acting
as platform providers in an OGD ecosystem to:

– enable an open collaboration within the ecosystem through the use of neces-
sary and available social boundary resources, for example, by providing open
communication channels, while also facilitating an open requirements man-
agement process and actively engaging the ecosystem in the collaboration.

5.5 OSS Development

Among the studied cases, HSL has a stronger focus on OSS development as
certain OSS projects have a more central role in the HSL DevCom ecosystem and
are aimed for the end-users. In the other ecosystems, the OSS projects developed
mainly serve as boundary resources to the developers in the ecosystems [5]. In
the cases studied, we have identiﬁed six categories of OSS projects that platform
providers may want to consider initiating and collaborating on:

– Data collection: In the case of JobTech Dev, SPES is employing OSS-based
technology (developed and maintained by a third party supplier) to collect
the job-ads from the diﬀerent job-ad suppliers.

– Data enrichment: OSS can also be used to enrich provided data with meta-
data or in other ways add value to it. In the case of JobTech Dev, SPES
provides internally developed functionality as OSS that helps actors to enrich
job-ads with meta-data.

– Inspiration and documentation: All four platform providers develop and
maintain application examples that can help users to understand how the
data can be used. In this sense, the examples can be seen as a source of
documentation. However, they may also inspire new use-cases that can be
of value both for entrepreneurs and incumbents.

– Development support: All four platform providers also see value in supplying
common tools, libraries, and frameworks that can enable actors to create new
products and services based on the data.

– Algorithms: The City of Chicago publishes algorithms used within the city,
in part for transparency, but also to gain help in making the algorithms
more eﬀective and correct. SPES publishes its algorithms for external actors
to test and validate the results they produce.

– Products and services: HSL takes it one step further and also develops OSS
products that can be used both by service providers such as traﬃc operators
and end-users, i.e., the commuters.

Recommendation: Based on the studied cases, we advice public entities acting
as platform providers in an OGD ecosystem to:

– develop and collaborate with the ecosystem’s actors on OSS that may im-
prove adoption and innovation based on the data. For example, OSS that
enables collection and enrichment of the data, provides inspiration and doc-
umentation, or general support to developers (such as tools, libraries, and
infrastructure). The platform provider may also consider sharing their ap-
plications that use the data as input, which may include algorithms, as well
as tools and consumer-facing products.

5.6 Data Sharing

To collaborate on data, the platform providers need to consider what type of
data that is (or could be) shared and provided on the platform. If the data is

How to Enable Collaboration in Open Government Data Ecosystems

25

produced externally, the platform provider takes on the role of a broker [16] or
intermediary [40], passing data on from the producers to the consumers which
is mainly the case for Samtraﬁken in the Traﬁklab ecosystem. The other three
ecosystems provide both internally and externally produced data. Diﬀerentiating
between organizational structures, as proposed by Oliveira et al. [31], therefore
becomes diﬃcult. Instead, to help characterize the types of data shared in an
ecosystem, we have distilled four categories of data based on the studied cases;
Internally produced data, Actively contributed data, Passively contributed data,
and Ecosystem-external data.

Internally produced data originates from within the platform provider. In
this case, the platform provider becomes the maintainer of the data and need
to consider how they want actors to be able to contribute to it. In terms of
the taxonomy data provided by SPES on the JobTech Dev platform, actors can
mainly contribute through the established feedback channels. There are however
examples where actors have contributed data sets directly to SPES which are
then incorporated into the data set manually.

Actively contributed data means data that ecosystem actors actively con-
tribute to the platform via tools or infrastructure provided by the platform
provider. In this case, the contributing actors maintain their data and can them-
selves choose when to update what is available on the platform. Examples from
the cases studied include the Career-initiative on the JobTech Dev platform,
where individuals store their resum´e-data, and city bike and car parking data,
which is contributed to the HSL DevCom platform.

Passively contributed data means data that the platform provider collects
from the ecosystem actors. The original data is maintained by the ecosystem ac-
tor, but what is available on the platform is dependent on the platform provider’s
collection and update procedures. One example is the traﬃc data from the re-
gional transport authorities that are collected by Samtraﬁken. A second example
is the job-ads from the job-ad providers that are collected by SPES. A third ex-
ample is the national data that is collected and broken down on a community
level by the City of Chicago.

External ecosystem data refers to data that is maintained in another data
ecosystem and collected by the platform provider and made available on the
platform, in a direct or enriched way. One example concerns OpenStreetMap
which map data is imported by HSL and used as input to their other data sets
and API:s. If HSL or any of the ecosystem actors wants to contribute to the map
data they can turn directly to the OpenStreetMap project.

Recommendation: Based on the studied cases, we advice public entities acting
as platform providers in an OGD ecosystem to:

– facilitate and enable the sharing of data, beyond their own. This can be
done either by helping the actors to actively or passively contribute their
data. In the active case, the actors use a technical infrastructure or commu-
nication channel provisioned by the platform provider. In the passive case,
the platform provider collects the data from the actor to then publish it on

26

the platform. A further aspect is to also consider how they can make use of
external ecosystems to collaborate on data.

5.7 Speciﬁcation and Standardization

The ecosystem enables a general adoption and promotion of existing standards
to promote interoperability among actors but also towards the surrounding or
neighboring domains. In the studied cases, standards mentioned have mainly
been domain-speciﬁc such as the GTFS format referring to traﬃc data (cf. ver-
tical industry standards [34]). When the data producers use a diﬀerent format,
they transform it accordingly. Similarly, SPES has chosen to adopt the HROpen
standard for their Career-initiative for individuals’ resum´es to be portable to
diﬀerent recruitment platforms internationally. When there are no existing stan-
dards that are suitable, the ecosystem oﬀers a potential venue for collaborating
on the development of new ones, as in Traﬁklab that developed a new standard
for tickets and payment transactions.

Recommendation: Based on the studied cases, we advice public entities acting
as platform providers in an OGD ecosystem to:

– adopt and promote open standards where possible to enable interoperability
within the ecosystem and well as to the outside. When needed, the platform
provider should also take an active role in facilitating the development of
new standards to achieve the same goal.

6 Summary and Conclusions

OGD ecosystems oﬀers public entities new ways in how they can address their
goals and directives. By opening up and enabling collaboration with cross-
sectoral actors and the public through an ecosystem, the public entities can
establish value networks with the potential to accelerate adoption and innova-
tion based on the data. However, to exploit such beneﬁts of open innovation,
these public entities need to move beyond the role of data provider to that of
a platform provider that actively enables and facilitates a collaboration on the
data and related boundary resources within the ecosystem.

The research goal of this study has been to explore how public entities in
the role as platform providers can enable collaboration in OGD ecosystems. To
address this goal, we have conducted a multiple case study of four OGD ecosys-
tems of varying characteristics in terms size, domain and geographical coverage.
Based on the a cross-case analysis, we synthesize a conceptual model (see Fig. 2)
that describe diﬀerent aspects of OGD ecoystems and how these may vary. These
aspects, for example, describes how collaboration can be enabled through diﬀer-
ent types of ownership of the platform provider, how the ecosystem’s scope can
vary, what roles the platform provider may undertake, how to enable open col-
laboration, and how to collaborate in terms of data sharing, OSS development,
and standards. For each aspect, we provide recommendations that, along with

How to Enable Collaboration in Open Government Data Ecosystems

27

the model, may provide guidance for public entities acting as platform providers
can enable sharing and collaboration on both OGD as well as any boundary
resources in the form of OSS and standards.

As this study is limited to exploring the collaboration in four instances of
OGD ecosystems, further research is required to validate both the model and
recommendations, create a deeper understanding, and improve the external va-
lidity [37]. Readers should consider the context of the platform providers and
their ecosystems as reported and adopt an analytical generalization to cases with
similar characteristics [37].

In future research, we intend to continue our exploration into the collabo-
rative aspects of OGD ecosystems in terms of both data, OSS, and standards,
taking both the platform providers’ and ecosystem actors’ perspectives. We fur-
ther aim to theorize how the data and software can be considered as commons
and what role public entities can play in preserving sustainable provisioning and
development of them.
