Abstract. This article provides detailed description on the fundamentals of aperture pho-
tometry analysis. The diﬀerential and all-sky aperture photometry techniques are described
thoroughly to depict the diﬀerence between the two techniques and their selection for deter-
mining the stars’ magnitudes and their respective magnitude errors. The crucial calibration
parameters required for the all-sky photometry analysis such as atmospheric extinction-
coeﬃcient, air-mass, zero point, color term and color index are discussed comprehensively
with their extraction from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) archive. The all-sky aperture
photometry technique is applied on the stars of an open cluster NGC 2420 to determine their
calibrated magnitudes and magnitude errors in the g, r, and i bands. The images required
for the analysis are extracted from data release DR12 of SDSS III archive. Herein, the pho-
tometry analysis is performed by the Makali’i: SUBARU Image Processor, a Windows-based
software. This software has a simple yet eﬀective GUI and it provides the starlight minus the
background sky light value with a single click. This article would aid in providing the insight
into the physics of aperture photometry by manually scanning the astronomical images. In
addition, the g, r, and i magnitudes are transformed to B, V, and R band magnitudes of
Johnson-Cousins UBVRI photometric system. The color magnitude diagram for both the
standard photometry systems are also provided.

Introduction

Astronomical images are signiﬁcant in the ﬁeld of astronomy as various pa-
rameters of the celestial objects could be determined from them by performing
diﬀerent analysis at multi- and/or broad-wavelengths, say from radio wave to
gamma rays. These astronomical images are investigated through techniques
such as digital image processing and analysis, photometry, astrometry, spec-
trometry, and polarimetry [Berry, R. et al., 2000], which would help in de-
termining various phenomena such as shapes and formation of star, distance,
temperature, life time (age) of a star, metallicity, supernova explosion, struc-
ture of galaxies, gamma ray bursts, activity in galactic nucleus, presence of
black holes/naked singularity, presence of dark matter/dark energy, and what
stars are made up of, among others. The astronomical images have digital
ﬁle format known as ﬂexible image transport system (FITS) [Hanisch, R.J. et
al., 2001]. Astronomical data taken by the scientists at diﬀerent wavelengths
are stored, transmitted and processed in FITS digital ﬁle format which in-
cludes multi-dimensional arrays, images, table, and quantitative information
to name a few. The latest version of the FITS format, standard and other
related information could be obtained from the “FITS Support Oﬃce” at
https://ﬁts.gsfc.nasa.gov/.

The most signiﬁcant information of any celestial object is its energy that
is received at the receiving station as an electromagnetic radiation. The obser-
vational science of studying the amount of energy received from any celestial
object is known as photometry. The astronomical photometry [Romanishin,
W., 2006] is one which involves the study of an astronomical object by measur-
ing the energy ﬂux or intensity of the light coming from it. The brightness of

any celestial object is measured with respect to its ‘Magnitude’ [Romanishin,
W., 2006,Warner, B.D., 2006] and if the magnitude of celestial body is known
then most of the stellar parameters could be determined. There are diﬀerent
astronomical photometry techniques, viz., aperture photometry, point-spread-
function (PSF) photometry and image subtraction, through which photometry
analysis is performed [Warner, B.D., 2006,Beck, S.J. et al, 2014,Gallaway, M.,
2016]. PSF photometry is utilized for the analysis of crowded star ﬁelds- the
globular galactic clusters [Allison, M., 2006]. On the other hand, the aperture
photometry is considered for analyzing the open galactic clusters [Allison, M.,
2006]. Further, these two photometry techniques utilizes either diﬀerential or
all-sky photometry to determine the magnitude of the celestial object [Berry,
R. et al., 2000].

Herein, an old open cluster NGC 2420 [Cannon, R.D. et al., 1970,McClure,
R.D. et al., 1974, Anthony-Twarog, B.J. et al., 1990] is selected to provide the
details on the procedure of performing diﬀerential and all-sky aperture pho-
tometry for the amateur astronomers. The open cluster is selected because
it is crucial for investigating the stellar evolution, age, metallicity, tempera-
ture, and mass of the Galactic disc [Oralhan, I.A. et al., 2015]. Many articles
are presented in the literature which provides the photometry analysis of the
open clusters. These analysis are based on ”IRAF Data Reduction and Analy-
sis System” [Tody, D., 1986,Grisetti, R., 2006] which is a Linux based analysis
procedure. Another approach to perform photometry is to use Python based
package “ASTROPY” [Robitaille, T.P. et al., 2013]. For the non-professionals
these prevailing techniques could be diﬃcult to understand and perform as
well as to install them. Hence, this article presents the photometry analysis
by utilizing a Windows-based software, viz., Makali’i: SUBARU Image Pro-
cessor [Horaguchi, T. et al., 2006]. This software has simple yet eﬀective GUI
to perform aperture photometry which would help the amateurs to get the
insight into the physics of diﬀerential and all-sky aperture photometry. The g,
r, and i magnitudes and magnitude errors of 192 stars in NGC 2420 are cal-
culated using all-sky aperture photometry method through Makali’i software
which are then compared with their respective standard catalog magnitudes
and the magnitude errors. Further, the g, r, and i magnitudes are transformed
into the B, V, and R magnitudes of the Johnson-Cousins UBVRI standard
photometric system. The images utilized are extracted from the data release
DR12 of the SDSS. In addition, the in-depth description on extracting the sig-
niﬁcant calibration parameters for all-sky photometry from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) archive is presented along with the inclusion of the criteria
to select the standard stars in case of diﬀerential photometry [Palmer, J. et
al., 2001].

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the details on the ob-
servational data. In Section 3, the aperture photometry is described in depth.
Section 4 presents the work description with the Concluding remarks in Sec-
tion 5.

1. Observational Data

for NGC 2420 are Cr 154 and Mel 69. The celestial coordinates of NGC 2420
taken from WEBDA (https://webda.physics.muni.cz/) are: RA (J2000) = 07h
38m 23s or 114.596°and Dec (J2000) = +21° 34′ 24′′or 21.573°. The image of
NGC 2420 is presented in Fig. 1 with North up and East left.

For the all-sky photometry analysis, the calibrated images of NGC 2420 are
utilized which are taken from the ﬁnal Data Release 12 (DR12) of the SDSS-
III (https://dr12.sdss.org/). In order to perform photometry on all the 192
stars, ﬁve images at diﬀerent RA and DEC are selected under each g, r, and i
band. Further, the ’tsﬁeld’ ﬁle for the respective ﬁve set of images at diﬀerent
celestial coordinates are taken to extract the parameters for the calibration
of magnitudes and also for determining the corresponding magnitude errors.
The SDSS archive has images taken from 2.5-m f/5 modiﬁed Ritchey-Chr´etien
altitude-azimuth telescope located at Apache Point Observatory, in south east
New Mexico. The ﬁve images of the NGC 2420 in g band having angular size
of 10′and the exposure time of 53.907 sec are presented in Fig. 2.

2. Aperture Photometry

The concept of stellar magnitudes was ﬁrst brought in by the Greek astronomer
Hipparchus in B.C 130. He classiﬁed stars based on their visual brightness (here
on wards Magnitude) on a scale that ranged from 1 to 6. According to his
classiﬁcation system, the brightest starts fall under ﬁrst class while stars with
least brightness corresponds to the sixth category. With the advent of telescope
and with the realization that the human eye has a logarithmic response to light,
new magnitude scale has been introduced by Norman Pogson. In this system,
over an increasing magnitude scale, any particular star is 100 times brighter
than its sixth higher magnitude star [Budding, E. et al., 2007].

The photometry involves measurement of a stars’ brightness in form of
magnitude from the digital image. When an image of a star is taken then
that image would not only have light from the star but it also includes the
light from the background sky. This causes the light from a star to spread into
wider area. Thus, it is essential to distinguish starlight from the background
sky light. This could be done in diﬀerent ways, of which one of the most
popular technique being aperture photometry. It should also to be noted that
prior to measuring the magnitudes from the images various instrumental eﬀects
should be removed from them. Some of the image calibrations requirements are
de-biasing, ﬂat-ﬁelding, and removal of the bad pixels eﬀects and cosmic-ray
events [Palmer, J. et al., 2001].

In aperture photometry, pixels that contain starlight are covered by a small
circular patch known as aperture. The background sky light is then captured
by a doughnut shaped patch, also named as annulus, whose center radius is
larger than that of the star aperture. Fig. 3(a) shows the star aperture and
the sky annulus. The light from the background sky is then eliminated by
subtracting pixels in background sky annulus from the star aperture [Berry,
R. et al., 2000, Beck, S.J. et al, 2014]. The best way to select appropriate star
radius is to ﬁrst ﬁnd the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the star bright-
ness curve or ﬁnd its Gaussian sigma (σ). Then the radius of star aperture is
selected as σ or half of the FWHM value. However, to capture the starlight in
totality the best practice is to set star radius ﬁve times the σ radius. Whereas,
the inner radius of the background sky aperture should be set at least twice
that of the star aperture. This would prevent the inclusion of any starlight
into the sky annulus. The Fig. 3(b) depicts the brightness proﬁle of a star
located at RA = 114.346°and DEC = 21.676°in NGC 2420 which is obtained
through Makali’i software. The FWHM and σ are related by the Eq. (1).

F W HM = 2.37σ

(1)

Once the photometric observations are achieved, they could be ﬁtted to
the theoretical isochrones to determine the essential stellar parameters such
as metallicity, stellar reddening, distance and ages. The isochrones are the
mathematical models which represents the Hertzsprung–Russell (HR) diagram
for a particular metallicity and age [Fatima, H. et al., 2016]. For instance, the
surface temperature of an object could be determined by ﬁtting the color-
magnitude diagram (CMD) with the HR diagram. Thus, diﬀerent isochrones
are overlapped with the photometric observations and the best ﬁt isochrones

located at RA = 114.346°and DEC = 21.676°in NGC 2420 obtained through
Makali’i software

are selected for the determination of the above mentioned parameters. The
database for isochrones could be found at the website of Padova database
(http://pleiadi.pd.astro.it/).

The magnitude of a star is obtained by accessing the pixel values present
in the star aperture and the sky annulus. These pixel values are also known as
“pixel count” and the magnitude obtained from these pixel counts is known
as “instrumental magnitude”. There are various ways to obtain instrumental
magnitude from the star aperture counts and the background sky aperture
count [Berry, R. et al., 2000, Palmer, J. et al., 2001]. One of the relationships
between them is shown in Eq. (2) [Berry, R. et al., 2000]:

mins = −2.5 



Capt − napt

t

Capt
nann (cid:17)

(cid:16)



+ Λ



(2)

In the relation (2), the Capt and napt are the sum of pixel values and
number of pixels in the star aperture, respectively, nann is the number of
pixels in the background sky annulus, and Λ is an arbitrary constant. The
arbitrary constant, Λ, is added to the instrumental magnitudes so that color
diﬀerence becomes equal to zero [Berry, R. et al., 2000,Palmer, J. et al., 2001].

2.1. Diﬀerential Aperture Photometry

In the diﬀerential aperture photometry, the apparent magnitude of the target
star is obtained from the instrumental magnitude by comparing the target
star with the standard star (also known as comparison star) that is present in
the same ﬁeld of view (FOV). In this technique, the target star has the same
FOV, same observation time, also it is observed through same ﬁlter and same
atmosphere as that of the standard star. Hence, all the atmospheric and equip-
ment parameters aﬀecting the brightness are cancelled out when the diﬀerence
between the standard and target star is taken. The only signiﬁcant parameter
to be taken into account is the diﬀerence of the target and the standard star.
The apparent magnitude of the target star in this case is obtained by the Eq.
(3) [Warner, B.D., 2006].

6

KP Kaur, PS Joshi

Mt = (mins t − mc) + Mc

(3)

In the Eq. (3), Mt and mins t are the apparent and instrumental magni-
tude of the target star, respectively, while the standard and the instrumental
magnitude of the standard (comparison) star is represented by Mc and mc,
respectively. The selection of standard star is crucial while performing the dif-
ferential photometry as the magnitude obtained here is solely dependent on
the diﬀerence of the standard and target star. Thus, the standard star mag-
nitude should be accurately determined in this technique. The points that
should be taken care of while selecting the standard star for comparison are
as follows [Beck, S.J. et al, 2014, Palmer, J. et al., 2001]:

i It should be a non-variable star.
ii It should not be a saturated star
iii It should lie near to the target star but not near any edges of the image.
iv It should be a discrete star not blended with other star/s.
v All the comparison stars should have similar wavelength (color).
vi It should not be a very blue or very red star.
vii It should have at least 100 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value.
viii It should have the magnitude near to the target star so that the magnitude

error is similar.

Herein, the Makali’i software is utilized to obtain the star count and the
background sky count pixels values for the determination of instrumental mag-
nitude. Makali’i software provides the “Result count” by a single click on the
image (g, r, and i images of the NGC 2420 in FITS ﬁle format) at the location
of the target/comparison star. The results generated on the software could
be stored as CSV ﬁle format which is then used to obtain the magnitude of
the target and the standard stars. The instrumental magnitude is obtained by
substituting ”Result count” in the Eq. (4). Then to this instrumental magni-
tude, the standard magnitude value of the comparison star (obtained from the
catalog) and its pixel count are added (Ref. Eq. (6)) to obtain the apparent
magnitude.

m = −2.5 log10 (count)

(5)

mtarget = −2.5log10

+ mcomp

(6)

Although, the diﬀerential photometry is easy but to determine the magni-
tude of any target star, the standard magnitude of the comparison star should
be known beforehand. Also, the comparison star should be on the same FOV
as that of the target star. If the comparison star is located out of the FOV

Fundamentals of Aperture Photometry

then the magnitude is obtained by the all-sky aperture photometry technique.
The diﬀerential photometry is employed, in general, when it is required to
investigate any change in the ”target” over certain interval of time. In this
technique, accuracy of the apparent magnitude depends on the selection of
the comparison star and on the exactness of the target and comparison star
diﬀerence.

2.2. All-Sky Aperture Photometry

All-sky photometry provides the magnitude of the target directly from the im-
ages taken at known atmosphere and system from a set of standard stars. This
technique is applied when the standard stars are outside the FOV, when the
images are taken at diﬀerent time, through diﬀerent ﬁlters and atmosphere.
Hence, the all-sky photometry requires meticulous observations that are sub-
jected to thorough and careful data reductions. This section presents the pro-
cedures, in-detail, to obtain the values for the calibration parameters, viz.,
atmospheric extinction-coeﬃcient, air-mass, zero point, color term and color
index. In addition, the steps to calculate the error magnitude is presented.

The procedure to ﬁnd the instrumental magnitude of the star in this tech-
nique is similar to that of the diﬀerential photometry. The formula for deter-
mining the instrumental magnitude is deﬁned by the Eq. (7).

mins = −2.5 log10 (counttarget) + Λ

(7)

Eventually, the instrumental magnitude is converted into calibrated mag-
nitude. The calibrated magnitude takes into account of eﬀects of atmospheric
extinction coeﬃcient (k), air-mass(X), color correction term (C), and color in-
dex (CI), to determine a magnitude which is tied to the standard photometric
system [Bessell, M.S., 2005]. The calibrated magnitude is deﬁned by the Eq.
(8) [Berry, R. et al., 2000, Warner, B.D., 2006, Gallaway, M., 2016, Palmer, J.
et al., 2001].

M = mins − Λ + ZP + kX + C × CI

(8)

The following section presents the steps to obtain the values of the above
mentioned calibration parameters [Berry, R. et al., 2000, Warner, B.D., 2006,
Gallaway, M., 2016, Palmer, J. et al., 2001] from the observed images.

2.2.1 Air-mass(X): Air-mass is known as the length of the air-path which
starlight travels through. As the light travels through some distance of the
atmosphere, some ﬁxed portion of light gets attenuated. Thus, it is necessary
to ﬁnd out what amount of light is lossed due to a particular unit of the air-
mass. The air-mass (length of air-path) depends solely on the zenith distance,
zL. The zenith distance is obtained from the Eq. (9) [Palmer, J. et al., 2001].

X = sec(zL) =

1
(sinφ)(sinδ) + (cosφ)(cosδ)(cosh)

(9)

8

KP Kaur, PS Joshi

In the above relationship, φ is the latitude of observation, δ and h are the
Declination and the hour angle of the observed target, respectively. The Right
Ascension (α) of the observed target and the local sidereal time (s) are related
to the hour angle by the Eq. (10).

h = s − α

(10)

2.2.2 Atmospheric Extinction Coeﬃcient (k): The atmospheric extinc-
tion is deﬁned as the dimming of a starlight as it passes through the atmo-
sphere. It has the units of magnitudes/air-mass. As the air-path increases, the
extinction also increases.

There are various methods to attain extinction coeﬃcient. One of the
widely used method to determine the atmospheric extinction is to observe
the same non-variable star during the night with any of the suitable ﬁlter at
various intervals as well as at diﬀerent zenith angles. The observed magnitude
of the observed star is then plotted against the calculated air-mass. The graph
thus, plotted should have a straight line where the slope is equal to the ex-
tinction. The atmospheric extinction depends strongly on the wavelength. For
instance, extinction is lower for red band than for the blue. Thus, in order to
neutralize the extinction precisely, the color of the star has to be included.
The extinction is then represented by the Eq. (11).

k = k

is 0 for the V

is
ﬁlter and for the following CI: U–B and B–V. Practically, the value of k
′′
very small and is hard to measure, hence it is ignored. However, to ﬁnd k
,
one could refer [Warner, B.D., 2006]. The magnitude after the compensation
of extinction is represented with a suﬃx ‘o’, it indicates that extinction eﬀects
have been removed from the magnitude. Sometimes, this magnitude is also
known as exoatmospheric magnitude and is represented by the Eq.(12)

′′

′′

mo = m − k

X(CI)

(12)

2.2.3 Color Index (CI) and Color-Correction Term (C): The system
response for a particular band of color ﬁlter may not be identical to that of the
standard photometric system. Thus, the color index and color correction terms
are included to remove any color dependency. The color term is determined
by obtaining the diﬀerence of the adjacent color ﬁlter band. For instance,
B-V, V-R, g-r, and r-i, to name a few. The change in the response between
the system under consideration and the standard photometric system is linear
for a particular color band (Ref. Fig. 5). Hence, the color correction term is
obtained in a manner similar to that applied for obtaining k. That is, observing

Fundamentals of Aperture Photometry

the star for certain interval of time throughout the night at diﬀerent zL and
then the best values for k and C are determined by ﬁtting the Eq. (13) using
the method of least square.

M = mins − Λ + kX + C × CI

(13)

2.2.4 Zero Point (ZP): Eventually, the exoatmospheric magnitude obtained
from the above calibration process is transformed to a magnitude that is tied
to a standard photometric system. For the determination of the zero point it
is essential to observe a primary or secondary standard star. The zero point is
determined from the exoatmospheric standard star magnitude. The zero point
magnitude is then calculated from Eq(14).

mzp = mstd − mostd

(14)

In the above equation, mzp is the zero-point magnitude, mstd is the catalog
standard magnitude and mostd is the exoatmosphric instrumental magnitude
of the standard star.

2.3. Error Magnitude
Because of the Poisson statistic behaviour of the detected photon there is a
inherent error in the photometry magnitude. The two ways to represent this
error or uncertainty are the signal-to-noise ratio and the standard deviation
present in the calculated magnitude of the star. The magnitude error, σm, for
a star is deﬁned by the Eq(15). This formula determines that if S/N is x, then
there is x% of error in the measured magnitude [Berry, R. et al., 2000,Howell,
S.B., 2000].

σm =

1.086
S/N

(15)

There is single signal source while there are several sources of noise such
as noises from the sky as well as noises from the detector. The noise sources
taken into account are readout noise, dark current, quantization noise, noise
due to star background count, to name a few. The signal-to-noise ratio is thus
deﬁned by the Eq. (15) [Howell, S.B., 2000].

S
N

=

q

N∗
N∗ + npix(NS + ND + N 2
R)

(16)

The numerator in the above equation, N∗, is the total number of photons
detected from the target. The terms in denominator of the Eq(16) are deﬁned
as npix is the number of pixels present in the target, NS is the total number
of photons per pixel from the background sky, ND is the total number of dark
current electrons per pixel, and N 2
R is the total number of electrons per pixel
resulting from the readout noise. The further details on the magnitude error
could be found in [Howell, S.B., 2000].

3. WORK DESCRIPTION

The all-sky photometry is performed on the 192 stars lying within and near
the radius of 6′from the center of NGC 2420. The stars are selected on the
basis of brightness perceived through naked eyes. The selected region and the
star numbers are adopted from [Cannon, R.D. et al., 1970]. As mentioned in
Section 1, ﬁve diﬀerent images are extracted for each g, r, and i bands to cover
all the 192 stars. The combined g band image with the selected 192 stars is
presented in Fig. 4 (North up and East left) and their celestial coordinates are
presented in Table 1. Each of these ﬁfteen images are then analyzed through
Makali’i software to convert the raw counts of the selected stars into the raw
instrumental magnitudes. As the NGC 2420 is an old open cluster, hence the
values for air-mass (X), atmospheric extinction (k), and zero points (ZP ) are
obtained from the ’tsﬁeld’ ﬁle present in the SDSS archive. The values of these
calibration parameters are depicted in Table 2.

Fig. 4. g-band image of NGC 2420 with the 192 selected stars

The ﬁnal calibrated magnitudes and the magnitude errors for the selected
stars in g, r, and i bands are obtained by substituting the values of the cali-
bration parameters from the Table 2 into the relations described in Section 2.2
and Section 2.3, respectively. The excel spreadsheets are utilized for ﬁnding out
the results from the respective equations. The SAOImage DS9 [Joye, W. et al.,
2020] software is used to locate and assign numbers to the selected stars. The
calculated calibrated magnitudes and error magnitudes for the ﬁrst 30 stars
are depicted in Table 3, which are also compared with their respective catalog
values. The SDSS DR12 catalog [SDSS catalog] is referred for comparing the
calculated results.

Further, these g, r, and i magnitudes are the transformed into the B, V,
and R band magnitudes of Johnson-Cousins UBVRI standard photometric

The calculated B, V, and R, magnitudes are presented in the Table 4. These
calculated B, V, and R magnitudes are compared with the NOMAD-1 catalog
magnitudes [NOMAD-1 catalog]. Also, the color magnitude diagram (CMD)
prepared from the calculated calibrated magnitudes of the 192 selected stars
for both the standard photometry systems are presented in Fig. 5.

It is observed that there is certain deviation between the calculated and
standard magnitudes. This is due to the accuracy with which the software
counts the star minus background sky counts, accuracy of detecting the aper-
ture center and the aperture parameters set while performing the aperture
photometric analysis through Makali’i software. In addition, it is noted that
the Makali’i softwar is capable of providing best results for the bright stars
only. It is analyzed that the Makali’i software is eﬀective for the stars which
have star minus background sky count value of 500 or greater. For the val-
idation of this statement, some of the dim stars are considered whose celes-
tial coordinates are presented in Table 5. In this analysis, the star celestial
coordinates and their respective numbers are adopted from [Ciroi, S. et al.,
2009,Rafanelli, P., et al. 2011]. The reason for selecting these stars is that most
of these are the dim stars in the g-band and are good candidates for dim star
analysis by Makali’i software. On analyzing the g-band images, it is observed
that some dim stars have the result counts below 500 and for some stars the

result counts are even zero. For these star the instrumental magnitude would
not be accurate. Hence, it could be said that although the Makali’i software
is simple and user friendly software but it is unable to detect and provide

Fundamentals of Aperture Photometry

Conclusion

This article provides the insight into the physics of diﬀerential and all-sky aper-
ture photometry by manually scanning the astronomical images. The astro-
nomical images of NGC 2420 are analyzed through a Windows based software:
Makali’i. The g, r, and i magnitudes and error magnitudes of 192 selected stars
present in an old open cluster NGC 2420 is calculated and then compared with
the respective standard magnitudes and error magnitudes of the catalog. It
is analytically observed that the Makali’i software does eﬀective photometry
analysis for the bright stars. However, for the faint star the software is un-
able to obtain the photon counts. It is noted that for count value (star minus
background sky) of less than 500, the instrumental magnitude is not accurate.
To overcome this deviation instead of using Makali’i software one could uti-
lize aperture photometry tool (APT). Further, all the calibration parameters
required for obtaining the calibrated magnitude is described in detail which
are then used to obtain the calibrated instrumental magnitude. In addition,
the calibrated instrumental magnitudes are transformed into the B, V, and R
band magnitudes of Johnson-Cousins UBVRI standard photometric system.
Also, the color magnitude diagrams for both ugriz and U BV RcIc standard
photometric systems are presented which are obtained from the calculated cal-
ibrated magnitude. Thus, this article aids the non-professionals to familiarize
with the fundamentals of the diﬀerential and the all-sky aperture photometry.
