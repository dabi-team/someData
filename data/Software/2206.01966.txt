Abstract: 

Introduction: Systems that exist in the hospital or clinic settings are capable of providing 

services in the physical environment. These systems (e.g., Picture Archiving and communication 

systems) provide remote service for patients. To design such systems, we need some unique 

methods such as software development life cycle and different methods such as prototyping. 

Clinical setting: This study designs an image exchange system in the private dental sector of 

Urmia city using user-centered methods and prototyping. Methods: Information was collected 

based on each stage's software development life cycle. Interviews and observations were used to 

gather user-needs data, such as object-oriented programming for developing a Prototype. 

Results: The users' needs were determined to consider at the beginning. Ease of use, security, 

and mobile apps were their most essential needs. Then, the prototype was designed and evaluated 

in the focus group session. These steps continued until users were satisfied in the focus group. 

Eventually, after the users' consent, the prototype became the final system. Discussion: Instant 

access to Information, volunteering, user interface design, and usefulness were the most critical 

variables users considered. The advantage of this system also includes less radiation to the 

patient due to not losing and missing the clips of the patient's images. Conclusion: The success 

of such a system requires the consideration of end-users needs and their application to the 

system. In addition to this system, having an electronic health record can improve the treatment 

process and improve the work of the medical staff.

Introduction: 

Considering  the  systems  in  health-related  contexts,  such  as  Hospital  Information  systems 

(HIS),  Picture  Archiving  and  Communication  Systems  (PACS),  and  Radiology  Information 

systems  (RIS),  they  are  mainly  related  to  patients  and  health  providers  at  a  physical  site,  for 

instance, a hospital or clinics. Such systems are primarily designed to provide a comprehensive 

service at a physical site (1,2). In this regard, systems such as RIS and PACS have the specific 

potential to transmit patient textual and visual information in the healthcare setting (3,4). Despite 

all benefits of web-based image transition systems, there are some problems in developing these 

systems, including privacy, security, cost-related issues, usability, evaluation, infrastructure, and 

2 

 
accessibility  in  terms  of  hardware.  Finally,  all  users  have  network  connections  through  mobile 

phones (3,5–7). 

Human-Computer  Interaction  (HCI) is  one  of  the  effective  methods  used  for  successful 

information systems analysis. Focusing on these kinds of analysis is mainly related to user-effected 

factors, including behavioral, cognitive, easy to use, and ergonomic ones. One of these approaches 

is the ‘User-Centric Approach’ in software analysis (5–8) which primarily considers the affairs 

from the users' perspective. The system's functions regarding the type of users using this system 

based on their different approaches are the most critical items that should be addressed in system 

analysis. This information should be widely gathered from all stakeholders and system end-users 

to create a system that meets the complex needs and expectations of the organization and its users 

regarding existing processes (5–9). 

Furthermore,  such  systems  must  be  evaluated  for  validation,  properly  working,  cost 

analysis, or any other goal that the system sets to achieve (10). Without consideration for the needs 

of all users in designing and implementing any system, the system would not work well at all. It 

will be tackled with colossal failure (4,7), which is highly important in evaluation (5,6,10). 

In general, a lack of paying attention to users' needs concludes the failure of the Electronic 

Health Record (EHR) system (11). Effectively, one of the main reasons for the success of a low-

cost portable system is the involvement of users in the early stages of prototype design (12). Some 

studies  reveal  that  focusing  on  users  and  their  needs  plays  an  essential  role  in  successfully 

implementing all systems (13–15). Due to the increasing use of exchanging medical information 

systems, the importance of users' comments in designing, implementing, and accepting the type of 

systems is highly significant (16). To design such effective systems, system developers, analyzers, 

and designers should use some methods, including waterfall methods, prototype development, and 

other  methods,  to  develop  information  systems  appropriately  and  evaluate  the  working  system 

(5,6,10). 

Appropriate design and creation refer to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in 

software  or  system  design.  These  methods  are  used  to  design  a  system  or  software  and  start 

conducting  several  stages  of  designing  and  planning,  programming,  implementing,  and 

maintaining the required system or software by guiding the management and executive team. The 

success and advantage of such systems are considered by evaluating the needs analysis of users, 

mainly end-users, designed by system designers and programmers (15). 

3 

 
Due to the central fact that such a system does not exist in Urmia dental private sector clinics, 

this study aims to design, develop and evaluate a user-centered system. Also, the importance of 

optimal  use  of  available  resources  for  a  fair  exchange,  evaluate  its  impacts  on  stockholders 

efficiency  (e.g.,  physicians,  patients,  and  assistants),  and  data  management  of  oral  and 

maxillofacial radiology images in Urmia dentistry private sector clinics.    

Materials and Methods: 

The present system is designed and developed in a repetitive methodology based on prototype 

development.  In  the  first  phase,  the  ‘users'  requirements’  are  gathered  regarding  ethnographic 

methods such as conducting interviews and observation to design and develop the required system. 

The  main  reason  for  conducting  an  interview  is  to  gather  information  regarding  the  system's 

features,  user  interface,  user  needs,  and  users'  expectations  of  the  system.  Regarding  the 

observation, it is mainly used to know users' workflow and their activities. In phase two (system 

design), the creation of a prototype with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Unified Modeling 

Language (UML) analysis, and prototype software model based on the gathered Information from 

phase  one  is  highly  considered.  The  result  of  phase  two  leads  to  the  production  of  a  system 

prototype. Phase  three (prototype implementation) will evaluate the prototype in  a focus group 

session and reiterate the last two processes to make the final prototype as the system. Lastly, in 

phase four (system implementation and evaluation), the system will be implemented in the real 

world with real users and eventually evaluated for usability. 

Phase one:  

In conducting the study, User-centered approaches such as interviews and observation are 

used  to  get  user  requirements.  A  face-to-face  semi-structured  interview  was  used  to  fully 

understand users' needs  and what they  expect from  the system.  To do so, 25 academic staff at 

Urmia University of Medical Sciences specialized in Endodontics, Pedodontics, Periodontics, Oral 

Medicine, Orthodontics, Restorative & Esthetic Dentistry, Prosthodontics, Oral & Maxillofacial 

Surgery,  and  Oral  and  Maxillofacial  Radiology  attended  at  this  study.  From  each  specialized 

group, two persons were selected. Five dentists, radiology assistants, and patients participated in 

the interview. Interviewees were selected based on their experience and eagerness to participate in 

4 

 
 
 
this  study.  Each  interview  took  20-35  minutes,  and  four  aspects  of  the  used  system,  including 

features  of  the  system,  User  Interface,  public  oral  health  education,  and  users'  workflow,  were 

considered (Table 2). These questions were considered an essential aspect of the design and were 

designed  by  the  research  team.  Before  conducting  any  interview,  getting  permission  from  all 

participants to record their voices and transform them into textual data was highly considered in 

this study. The interview was conducted by one of the researchers who had previous knowledge 

of  software  development.  Finally,  the  observation  method  was  used  to  gather  Information 

regarding dentists' workflow in their private clinics and how they order exams. 

Phase two:  

 The  Prototype  methodology  is  used  to  design  the  required  prototype  according  to  the 

users’  needs  in  the  previous  section.  Accordingly,  after  extracting  the  Information  through 

interviews and observation, a required prototype is available to get feedback and comments more 

quickly. UML analyzes users' needs, and the Use Case Diagram is drawn to visualize their needs 

and expectation. Finally, by conducting Object-oriented programming, a prototype is developed. 

Afterward, the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is drawn. In this phase, the prototype design 

is conducted regarding the obtained Information from the users' expectations and needs.  

This  web-based  prototype  is  mainly  designed  by  applying  Hypertext  Preprocessor 

(PHP) as  an  open-source  dynamic  scripting  language.  PHP  develops  various  frameworks  for 

programming cake PHP, lithium, and other frameworks. This framework helps programmers with 

better  data  management,  security,  and  coding.  In  this  scenario,  a  self-made  framework  for 

developing  this  prototype  is  used  (17).  The  architecture  of  this  work  followed  Model-View-

Controller (MVC) for better controlling databases, viewing the Information, and practical coding 

(18). the Bootstrap framework developed and presented by Twitter is used To display this web 

application on various devices. This framework allows the programmer to display this web system 

on different screen sizes, such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices (19). Due to 

the  urgent  need  for  a  faster  system,  Asynchronous  JavaScript  and  XML,  or  so-called  AJAX 

technology,  are  highly  recommended  and  applied  to  speed  up  the  display.  Without  having  to 

refresh, this technology can display Information and events on the client-side (20). For security 

affairs,  JSON  Web  Token  (JWT) is  highly  used  in  API  for  a  secure  connection  in  the  retrofit 

5 

 
 
system.  Also,  SSL  (Secure  Socket  Layer)  connection  is  applied  for  secure  data  transmission 

between API and other devices. 

Because  of  a  necessary  need  for  a  mobile  application  to  connect  this  system  to  mobile 

applications,  the  Application  Program  Interface  (API)  is  applied.  This  link  will  create  a  web 

application for the mobile platform (21). In this study, the targeted mobile operating system was 

the Android open-source operating system, not IOS, because of the limited budget. This web-based 

system  is  designed  to  run  on  Android  mobile  devices  by  installing  a  program  to  display 

Information to the dentist and carry out a limited number of features. The database used to store 

data was the MySQL database which is free of charge.  

Phase three:   

Accordingly,  after  designing  the  prototype,  its  implementation  regarding  the  previous 

phases is performed. Active users during interviews are selected and gathered in a focus group 

meeting. The prototype system is presented in this session. Users can interact with this prototype, 

view the system user interface, and mention their comments in this regard. After this phase is done, 

their comments are added. Afterward, users agreed with this prototype as their final system. After 

designing, this web system runs on a local Linux web server displayed in the focus group session. 

After  re-designing  and  re-providing  users'  requirements,  the  problems  or  computer  bugs  are 

critically examined by the programmer and analyst of the system.  

Phase four: 

As the final stage of any system’s life cycle, the final system will be implemented in the 

real world with actual patient data. At first, creating a user account for dentists and radiologists is 

needed. Then, radiologists and dentists were individually trained in a separate session before using 

the system. Staff was given the training needed to use at a radiology center. On the first day, four 

dentists  entered  the  system.  Then,  in  the  following  days,  the  number  of  dentists  visiting  the 

radiology center increased to eight. Finally, we have introduced a second radiology center to the 

system on the first weekend (dentists are no longer in the office on Thursdays, and there will be 

lower radiologists' workloads). Like the first center, a small number of dentists' patients entered 

the system. Finally,  four radiology centers entered within four weeks to familiarize themselves 

with the system's workflow and data entry. 

6 

 
 
The process was admitting the patients associated with the dentists who are members of 

the system. The new process was explained to patients and given an informed consent form. After 

taking the radiologic image, their radiography images are sent through this system to their dentist. 

Patients' hard-copy images are given to themselves with usernames and passwords to access their 

soft-copy images via the system provided. On the other hand, dentists have access to their patient’s 

information through the system. If they need any help from other dentists or radiologists, they can 

refer the patient.  

During the first month of implementing this system, an evaluator did a formative evaluation 

to prevent the system from any system failure. Finally, after the implementation of this system, a 

self-made questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Unified Theory of 

Acceptance  and  Use  of  Technology  (UTAUT),  Task-Technology  Fit  (TTF),  and  diffusion  of 

innovations  theory  to  evaluate  the  system  was  designed  (22,23,32,24–31).  The  questionnaire 

contains three parts, demographic Information, IT knowledge, and system evaluation that include 

efficiency, ease of use, quality of UI, quality of communication, reliability, system satisfaction, 

and voluntary usage of the system. Data were analyzed with SPSS 16 and tested with backward 

multivariate  linear  regression.  The  validity  of  this  questionnaire  was  checked  by  four  faculty 

members of the Department of Health Information Technology (HIT) and two faculty members of 

dentistry. Also, the reliability of the questionnaire was cheeked by test-retest (Cronbach's alpha). 

Results: 

Phase one:  

Interviews results: Demographic Information of interviewees is demonstrated in Table 1. 

The lists of questions for the required interviews were categorized in Table 2. the collected data 

from interviews were categorized into four main aspects. Afterward, the results were ranked based 

on the repetition rate (low, medium, high, very high), also shown in Table 3.  

Observation results: According to the observations, the workflow in the clinics is to A) 

visit the patients, B) order radiography if necessary, and finally, C) bring back the radiography 

image/images to his/her dentist (in Urmia, the radiology dental sector is separated from other 

sectors in oral health care wards). In some clinics, imaging radiography is available only for 

7 

 
 
 
periodical images but not for other types of dental imaging if and only if the principles of 

radiation protection are required. 

Put Tables 1, 2, and 3 here. 

Phase two:  

This section presents the logical and physical design of the prototype and system. The 

use-case diagram explains what users of the system can do and the actions they can make. 

Login pages for different users have a different dashboard that briefly presents their work 

status, such as unread messages number of patients. Radiologists’ dashboard has features such as 

adding patient’s name, last name, national code, address, doctor, birth date, phone number, 

disease history, and insurance code for data entry. However, only their name and national code 

are mandatory. After adding a patient, it will be added to the patients' list, and by clicking on 

their name, their radiography image and its report can be added, respectively. Also, on that list, 

any referral patient can be seen. In the message section, they can send a message to the system 

administrator as a help desk. This dashboard is demonstrated in figure 1.  

Put figure 1 here. 

Dentists’ dashboard (demonstrated in figure 2) has features including their patients and their 

images. Also, they can send their patient’s images to any colleague or can see their colleagues’ 

referral patient’s radiography and its report. Also, all pages can be viewed on mobile browsers 

without any complications, as shown in figure 3. 

Put Figure 2 here 

Put Figure 3 here 

Phase three:  

 Selections of significantly active users in the requirement phase are made as to the focus 

group  (10  people).  First,  their  needs  and  expectations  are  considered,  then  the  prototype  is 

presented respectively. They have interacted with this system, see its user interface, and mentioned 

their opinions. Due to simple access to mobile, the demand for a developed mobile app (n>6) is 

highly  recommended.  Furthermore,  the  need  for  radiological  reports  and  their  graph  is  mainly 

8 

 
 
requested  (n>6)  as  a  part  of  the  system.  Other  significant  demands  have  a  referral  system  for 

radiologists,  adding  radiologic  exams  for  patients,  and  creating  a  mark  on  the  photo  to  easily 

convey their meaning to the radiologist or dentist's colleague (3>n>5). Finally, after adding these 

requests,  the  system  is  re-presented  to  another  focus  group,  and  users  express  their  range  of 

satisfaction. Their opinions regarding system operation, data entry, minimum data set, and system 

workflow are evaluated and considered by the users working on the system. 

Phase four:  

In this study, four radiology centers, nine dentists, and 50 patients entered the system in 

first month of implementation. Cronbach's alpha is 0.986. The correlation between the variables is 

show  at  Table  4,  and  multivariate  linear  regression  is  shown  at  Table  5  respectively.  End-user 

including  22.5%  dentists  (n=9),  10%  radiologists  (n=4),  52.5%  patients  (n=21),  and  15% 

radiologist’s assistants (n=6) willingly completed the questionnaire (total n=40). The participants 

age is 33.30 ± 6.42 (Mean ± STD). Degree of education are 17.5% diploma (n=7), 37.5% bachelor 

(n=15), 12.5% master (n=5) and 32.5% Ph.D. (n=13) and field of study are 5% Periodontist (n=2), 

22.5% Radiologist (n=9), 5% Orthodontist (n=2), 5% Oral Medicine (n=2), 7.5% General Dentist 

(n=3) and 55% other (n=22). Also 50% of the users have had training for using the system (n=20), 

and 50% hadn’t any training (n=20). Among trained users 50% had in person training for using 

the system (n=20). 90% of users use the system less than seven hours in a week (n=36) and only 

10% use the system more than 21 hours  in a week  (n=4)  that mostly are radiologists and their 

assistants. Users’ device is 52.5% PC via the website (n=21), 40% mobile phone (n=16) and 7.5% 

with tablet (n=3).  

Put Table 4 here. 

Correlations between these variables are significant (CI=95%, P-value <= 0.05):  

•  Beneficent with UI, Interaction, reliability, satisfaction, voluntary and IT knowledge  

•  UI with beneficent, interaction, satisfaction, and IT knowledge  

• 

Interaction with beneficent, UI, reliability, satisfaction, and voluntary  

•  Reliability with beneficent, interaction, satisfaction, and voluntary  

•  Satisfaction with beneficent, UI, Interaction, reliability. voluntary and IT knowledge  

9 

 
 
•  Voluntary with beneficent, Interaction, reliability, and satisfaction. 

The different number in the correlations table is because some parts of the questionnaire for 

patients and assistants were not asked. As a result, the N is 19. 

Discussion: 

Put table 5 here 

In this study, the users’ needs regarding their working settings in Urmia City are divided into 

four  general  categories  of  needs.  In  the  first  category,  the  features  of  this  system,  including 

descriptions of users’ needs, comments, suggestions, communication among colleagues, images 

or reports  sent to physicians, use of a mobile application, and  sending messages to  doctors are 

mainly considered. The second feature in designing the system is appearance and users' interface, 

which are other important factors. Ultimately, all users have been asked about the existence  of 

such a system in their work. Also, the patients' economic and welfare point of view, which has 

proclaimed the system's success, is comprehensively considered.  

According  to  the  interview  results  obtained  from  dentistry  faculty  members  at  Urmia 

University  of  Medical  Sciences,  the  effect  of  a  mobile  application  accompanied  by a  report  of 

images, the convenience of working with the system, and a user-friendly interface regarding users' 

needs were evaluated. In this regard, speed, security, communication with others, notifications, 2D 

images, proper design, general education for the patient, patient access,  orders sending through 

this  system,  image  processing,  and  usefulness  in  the  user's  work  routine  are  highly  demanded 

analysis. Meanwhile, the need for paramedical Information, 3D imagery, and an online booking 

system has been a minor requirement in users’ needs analysis. These results indicate that dentists, 

radiologists, and their assistants are looking for a system that works quickly to reveal the results 

of patients without needing any prior training. In this regard, easy accessibility to mobile is the 

main reason for its popularity among users. Using free programs and methods such as Linux Web 

Server, PHP programming language, Android application, and MySQL database to cut down the 

project costs are considered in this study.  

In a User-Centric method of designing a system, the primary process is to consider each stage 

of  the  system  development,  including  analysis,  development,  and  evaluation,  respectively.  In 

analyzing the system, using ethnographic methods to assess users' needs by interviewing, studying 

10 

 
the  field,  preparing  the  workshop  for  a  focus  group,  and  analyzing  all  activities  to  get  a  result 

should  be  considered.  System  design,  a  variety  of  development  methods  such  as  Rapid 

Implementation  Method,  Prototype  Approach,  using  software-based  system  analysis  methods 

including  Use  case  to  analyze  and  display  users'  needs  is  highly  recommended.  This  method 

requires no prior computer knowledge for users. Finally, after analyzing and developing systems, 

a system evaluation method is used to evaluate this prototype or system from the users' point of 

view quantitatively (14,15). 

Using  interviews  to  verify  users'  needs  and  converting  this  Information  into  use-case 

information for software programming are all applied in this research. The present study considers 

the dentists' interviews and takes all system stockholders' comments to have an effective system. 

After developing and injecting user views into the prototype and final system, the system must be 

tested in a real-world environment with factual Information by the end-users involved in its design 

for a month. 

 Pearson's correlation analysis indicates that the ease of using a variable has little effect on the 

other variables. However, the beneficent, voluntary item and IT knowledge variables affect other 

variables. This deduction may mean that end-users do not feel that the designed system is helpful 

for them, voluntarily, not compulsively. Ultimately, IT knowledge can be expressed as accepting 

the system for them, and it is easier and better to work with the system. According to studies, the 

success of a system is relevant to engaging its users (33). Also, the regression relationship between 

the evaluation variables is evident. The most impact on the variables is voluntary, and most of the 

variables with a coefficient determination of about one. Voluntary use of the system affects the 

amount  of  beneficence,  ease  of  use,  system  interaction,  reliability,  and  satisfaction.  The  user 

interface is related to the degree of usefulness and interaction, in which beneficence is associated 

with the user interface and voluntary, and the system interactions are associated with voluntary 

and  satisfaction.  In  general,  volunteering,  satisfaction,  and  user  interface  have  impacted  the 

system's design most. 

Users who commented on the use of this system after using it also  stated that they had the 

proper  hardware  infrastructure  to  use  such  systems  in  the  health  sector.  Not  having  a  suitable 

system in the office for quick viewing of images, the lack of uploading images from the radiology 

center  images  due  to  the  high  workload,  aging  process,  and  not  being  accustomed  to  viewing 

11 

 
digital  images  in  the  office  are  disadvantages  of  the  system  from  the  end  user's  perspective. 

Regarding the advantages, eliminating medical clips, storing images in a centralized environment, 

reducing  the  probability  of  clips  being  lost  or  destroyed,  and  less  patient  exposure  are  mainly 

emphasized. This system will improve their workflow, and, in some cases, the lack of electronic, 

oral health records in dentists' offices was the main problem in this study. If there are some rules 

to help create a fully electronic oral health record, they would be excellent assistance in removing 

all physical data in oral health sectors. It also reduces printing and maintenance costs for radiology 

centers, and thus patients' imaging costs will be reduced. 

Conclusion: 

In  general,  the  success  of  the  IT  system  in  the  private  dental  sector  in  Urmia  City  with 

providing  the  appropriate  infrastructure  and  designing  a  user-centric  system  and  voluntary 

deployment of these systems can provide cost and health benefits to the stockholders of this sector. 

Also, it can improve the patient's treatment process by having an electronic health record in the 

private sector to have a cooperative relationship with the governmental sector. 

Limitation: An Android mobile application was developed due to having a problem publishing the 

IOS app. Furthermore, there is a lack of patient corporation with the research team.
