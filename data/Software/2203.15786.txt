Abstract—This work explores the application of nonlinear
oscillators coupled by electric ﬁeld in water for collective tasks
in underwater robotics. Such coupled oscillators operate in
clear and colloidal
(mud, bottom silt) water and represent
a collective electrochemical sensor that is sensitive to global
environmental parameters, geometry of common electric ﬁeld
and spatial dynamics of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).
Implemented in hardware and software,
this approach can
be used to create global awareness in the group of robots,
which possess limited sensing and communication capabilities.
Using oscillators from different AUVs enables extending the
range limitations related to electric dipole of a single AUV.
Applications of this technique are demonstrated for detecting the
number of AUVs, distances between them, perception of dielectric
objects, synchronization of behavior and discrimination between
’collective self’ and ’collective non-self’ through an ’electrical
mirror’. These approaches have been implemented in several
research projects with AUVs in fresh and salt water.

tive cognition, electrical mirror.

I. INTRODUCTION

Underwater exploration became recently an important eco-
nomic, ecologic and social concept. Possible tasks for au-
tonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) include monitoring
ecologically sensitive areas, exploration of the seabed, safety
inspections, and ﬁnding objects of interest [1]. Challenges of
underwater robotics are related, among others, to a high damp-
ing factor of water, which limits sensing and communication
capabilities of AUVs [2].

To extend these limitations, the state of the art approach is
to use multiple AUVs [3]. These are small robot platforms,
designed to operate in collective way. This approach has
several advantages such as exploration of large areas, increased
functional operability through heterogeneity, enhanced relia-
bility and a lower cost of platforms. Research and techno-
logical developments concern collective cognitive capabilities,
coordination of the whole robot group, platform design and
other issues [4].

Interesting bio-inspired solution observed in weakly electric
ﬁsh [5], [6] consists in using underwater electric ﬁelds for
collective sensing and communication. This approach imple-
mented for different purposes in potential and current modes
[7], [8], [9] demonstrated strong and weak sides of such tech-
nology. For example, some difﬁculties are related to electric
dipole of a single AUV limited by the body length of AUV
[10]. Due to small dipole size, the effective range of electric-
ﬁeld-based interactions is also limited. Improvement of this
technology can be achieved by using multiple oscillating

dipoles coupled by electric ﬁeld. Such coupled oscillators are
sensitive to spatial distribution of dipoles, their orientation
and presence of obstacles in a common ﬁeld. Variation of
these parameters inﬂuences common synchronization patterns,
amplitude/phase of signals. Individual robots, despite limited
sensing capabilities, can become aware of a global environ-
mental state by measuring parameters of local oscillations.

Speciﬁc frequency-current dynamics of oscillating dipoles
can be used in a manner of electrochemical
impedance
spectroscopy [11] with different oscillating frequencies. Such
collective electrochemical sensor is used for environmental
sensing, detection of conducting/dielectric objects and sensing
in colloidal (mud, bottom silt) solutions. Different interference
patterns enable identiﬁcation of AUVs and underwater bea-
cons.

In this paper, nonlinear effects of electric-ﬁeld-coupled
oscillators and their applicability to AUVs [12], [13] are
explored. It is demonstrated that changes in amplitude, phase
and temporal patterns of signals can be attributed to various
group-internal/-external events. Global synchronization effects
can also be used for behavioral coordination. In particular,
we explore the capability to discriminate between collectively
self- and nonself- generated signals by a so-called ’electrical
mirror’ [14]. Similarly to an optical mirror,
the electrical
mirror reﬂects received electrical signals and allows a robot to
receive its own electrical reﬂection. The correlation between
emitted and received signals enables robots to determine
group afﬁliation or to discriminate between ’collective self’
and ’collective non-self’. Electric ﬁsh recognize self-/nonself-
generated signals in a similar way [15]. These experiments
represent one of developmental lines for designing collective
cognitive capabilities in a group of AUVs, which were im-
plemented in several research projects with underwater robots
[16], [14], [12], [13] operating in fresh and salt water.

II. OSCILLATORS WITH EMBODIED COUPLING

Coupled oscillators are well known in theoretical physics
[17] and nonlinear control
[18], where different spatio-
temporal effects are observed [19]. Both low-dimensional [20],
[21] and high-dimensional coupled map lattice (CML) [22]
have applications in secure communication and functional
control. The CML approach represents a useful modeling
tool for studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of complex
nonlinear systems. Examples are the concepts of algorithmic
and analytic agents [23], [24] decision-making processes [25],
[26] and homeostatic regulation [27] on a collective level.

 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to disembodiment of state variables and couplings, the
dynamics of CMLs can be investigated analytically as well as
numerically. However, such a disembodiment imposes several
limitations on applications of this technique in robotics [28].
Another approach for coupled oscillators is represented
by central pattern generators (CPG) [29], which are inves-
tigated e.g. in neuroscience, biology [30] and in locomotive
control [31]. The state variables of CPG are embodied (for
example the amplitude of a biped movement); the disem-
bodied ’virtual channels’ are used for information exchange
between oscillators. Due to embodiment, CPG-based coupled
oscillators are widely used in robot controllers [32], [33]. The
CPG approach represents a balance between using embodied
processes as state variables and the possibility of analytical
treatments for complex biological or technological processes.
This work proposes an approach that differs from the CML
and CPG-based methodologies. The idea is to involve physical
embodiment for coupling instead of state variables. Such an
approach is more natural for operations in liquid media with
a high damping factor. For instance, interferences between
electric ﬁelds emitted by oscillating dipoles can represent an
embodied coupling mechanism, see Fig. 1(a). This coupling
depends on parameters of water (e.g. salinity, geometry of
sensing area, presence of obstacles), the frequency of individ-
ual oscillations, the number of dipoles and distances between
them, relatives positions and orientations of dipoles in three-
dimensional space. All these parameters reﬂect the global state
of the system. The perception of this information is strongly
local. Analyzing perturbations of oscillations [34], each robot
can become aware of the global situation and can undertake
corresponding activities.

and (b) with electrical mirror.

Structures of oscillating devices are shown in Fig. 2. For
modelling we use time-discrete dynamical systems [35], [21],
because they are suitable for implementation in a microcon-
troller. The signal from the oscillator ξo
n at each time step
n is converted into an analog signal by the DAC, which is
connected to the positive- E+ and negative- E− emitting
electrodes. In potential mode, the positive- R+ and negative-
R− receiving electrodes are connected to a high-pass ﬁlter,
ampliﬁer and ADC and represent the signal ξw
n from water at
the time step n, see Fig. 2(a). In the current mode, a single

2

pair of electrodes is used to produce the potential and to
sense a current between electrodes, see Fig. 2(b). Analytical
considerations, represented below, can be applied to both
modes of operations.

simpedance ampliﬁer).

Let xn be a state variable and f (xn, α) – a function of xn
and the control parameter α. The dynamical system can be
written in the form

ξo
n = f (xn, α),

xn+1 = f (xn, α) + k2ξw
n ,

(1)

(2)

where k2 is a coefﬁcient. The variable ξw
n contains own signal
sent by the emitting electrodes as well as signals from other
emitting devices. Since own signal has an essential impact on
the dynamics of the system (2), we can follow two strategies to
remove it from ξw
n . First, we can set k2 = 0 and investigate the
dynamics of ξw
n without modifying the dynamics of xn. Since
the coupling is embodied, the dynamics of ξw
n can provide
enough information about the global state of the system. In
the second strategy, the signal is subtracted from the equation
(2). The term (ξw
n) represents the coupling part from
other oscillating devices, where k1 is the coefﬁcient reﬂecting
the damping factor of water as well as the ampliﬁcation in
electronics. The following condition

n − k1ξo

n − k1ξo
ξw

n = 0

(3)

should be satisﬁed when no other oscillating devices are in the
water. This is achieved by calibrating the device and setting
the coefﬁcient k1. The following system

ξo
n = f (xn, α),

xn+1 = f (xn, α) + k2(ξw

n − k1ξo
n)

(4)

(5)

represents the model of an oscillating device. In the following
we use only Eq. (5), bearing in mind ξo

n = f (xn, α).

In further treatment of f (xn, α) we involve the well-known
logistic map xn+1 = αxn(1 − xn), where x ∈ R is the
state variable and α is the control parameter. Since the input
from water does not include a constant potential (which is

be transformed to remove such a potential. This is achieved
by eliminating the non-periodic stationary states. Solving
xn = αxn(1 − xn), we receive xst1,2 = {0, α−1
α }. From the
linear stability analysis we know that xst1 = 0 is stable in the
region α = (−1..1) and xst2 = α−1
is stable in the region
α
α = (1..3). By inserting a new variable yn = xn + α−1
α and
yn+1 = xn+1 + α−1
α and rewriting the systems in terms of the
variables xn and xn+1, we obtain

xn+1 = xn(2 − αxn − α).

The stationary state xst1 = − α−1
(−1..1) and xst2 = 0 in the region α = (1..3).

α is stable in the region α =

For further tests in Sec. III we use Eq.(6) in the form of

Eq.(5); thus

xn+1 = xn(2 − αxn − α) + k2(ξw

is used in the microcontroller for generating oscillations.
Coupling through an electric ﬁeld in water for low frequencies
can be approximated by (cid:80)m
j=1 gjxj
n, where g represents the
distance from j−device to a mutual center of the system [36].
For the case shown in Fig. 1(a), we assume that the coefﬁcient
k1 is calibrated so that its signal is ﬁltered from the received
signal. Since potential ﬁelds have properties of superposition,
the system (7) for several devices can be represented as

into consideration (see Sec. III), we can use only a period-two
motion of (8) and corresponding global synchronization effects
as reported in [37], [38].

A. Coupled Oscillators Mode with k2 = 0

The coupled oscillators mode corresponds to the case in
which each of devices implements Eq.(7), emits ↑ ξi
n and
receives ↓ ξi
n from the water. Since coupling is performed
using an electric ﬁeld with additive properties, the term ↓ ξi
n
contains all signals from other oscillators. In the case of
k2 = 0, the term ↓ ξi
n does not inﬂuence the dynamics of
Eq.(7). The dynamics of ↓ ξi
n is determined by two factors:
different gj caused by the distance between devices and phase
desynchronization of oscillators, see more in Sec. IV-C1.
in
To exemplify the effect of phase desynchronization,
Fig. 3(a) we plot the behavior of two equations (7), which have
slightly different resolutions of step n (this is performed in
numerical simulation) and, in Fig. 3(b), the term (cid:80)m
2xj
n.
The resolution of step n in Fig. 3(b) is ten times higher than
in Fig. 3(a), i.e., one step n is represented by 10 points. We
can see that the maximum and minimum values are generated
by xn(g1 + g2) and xn(g1 − g2). Since gj is primarily related
to distances between oscillators, the maximum value of the
signal provides information about (cid:80)m
j=1 gj, that is, the sum
of all distances between devices.

which corresponds to the value ↓ ξi
n from the water, g1 = g2 = 0.1
(resolution of step n is ten times higher).

B. Coupled Oscillators Mode with k2 (cid:54)= 0

For the case k2 (cid:54)= 0 it is assumed that k1 is calibrated so that
the inﬂuence of own variables in ↓ ξi
n is neglected. Thus, the
system (8) has only one-way coupling with another variable,
n . To summarize the changes caused by gj and
denoted as xi+1
by k2, we consider only the coefﬁcient k2. For simpliﬁcation,
it
the distance between devices is equal.
Nonlinear effects related to asynchronous updates [39] and
desynchronization are neglected. To analyze the periodical
behavior, we consider the second-iteration of the map, i.e.
f (f (x)), which takes the following form for the system (8)
with m = 2:

is assumed that

n+1 = (xi

considering boundary conditions for xi+1
system with 16 stationary states xi
st. Here, period-two station-
ary states from (8) become non-periodic and can be analyzed.
The Jacobian of the system (9) has two eigenvalues λ1,2. From
the stability conditions |λ1,2| ≤ 1 evaluated on each xst, yst,
we can estimate which stationary states are stable. This step
is done by combining analytic and numeric approaches. The
stable xst ∈ R (without complex conjugated xst) are shown
in Fig. 4(b) and corresponding eigenvalues in Fig. 4(a). We
observe two bifurcations at k2 = −0.21 and k2 = 0.33;
further, the system (9) has multiple stable stationary states.
Since complex conjugated stationary states are also stable in
this region of the parameter k2, the linear stability analysis
points to two bifurcation scenarios: ﬁrst, a period-doubling
scenario for k2 < 0, second, a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation
for k2 > 0. Since nonlinear analysis is outside the scope of
this work, we investigate the behavior of (8) numerically. The
change of bifurcation scenarios is demonstrated in Fig. 4(c).
We also observe a switch between stable stationary states by
varying initial conditions xi
0 in Fig. 4(d). Thus, a variation of
the coefﬁcient k2 (the distance between oscillating devices)
primarily leads to changes in the amplitude of period-two
signal or to an appearance of qualitatively different types of
behavior.

Considering the problem of m > 2, we note that values of
k2 < 0 lead to synchronization of amplitudes in period-two

all distances between the AUVs. We see that the local value

C. Electrical Mirror Mode

A swarm of AUVs in coupled oscillator mode with Eq. (7)
can interact either with another swarm of AUVs or with the
electrical mirror, as shown in Fig. 1. In the second case shown
in Fig. 1(b), the AUV’s individual oscillations will be reﬂected
by the mirror. Since the correlation between self- and reﬂected
signals dramatically changes the dynamics, the swarm can
collectively recognize this global situation.

The mirror device stores the common signal (i.e. the term
j=1 gjxj
n) at each time step and sends it back with delay γ.

This delayed signal creates

The electrical mirror corresponds to the delayed feedback
produced when the same signal with delayed γ steps xn−γ is
added to the system (for γ = 0 we add a non-delayed signal).
Assuming the coefﬁcient k1 is calibrated and the self-signal
is ﬁltered out, we rewrite Eq.(6) in the following form

Equation (12) can be considered as a model of time-delayed
feedback for two emitting devices (one oscillator and one
electrical mirror). Each of the delayed terms has a spe-
ciﬁc inﬂuence on the dynamics: they shift the correspond-
ing bifurcation and to some extent ’stretch’ or ’squeeze’
the whole dynamics. In Fig. 6(a) we demonstrate the term
0.45xn−1 − 0xn−2, which shifts the ﬁrst period-doubling
bifurcation backwards with regard to parameter α. Fig. 6(b)
shows the term −0.45xn−1 − 0.45xn−2, which shifts the ﬁrst
bifurcation forwards and the second bifurcation backwards.

II-B uses different amplitudes
of the period-two oscillation, here a transition to non-periodic
or to period-four oscillation by means of delayed feedback is
implemented. These two possibilities are shown in Fig. 7(a),
where the values of k3 in the range [−1...−0.0333] at α = 3.1
lead to non-periodic behavior and in Fig. 7(b) the values of
k4 in the range [0...0.3] at k2 = 0.138 and α = 3.1 lead to
the period-four behaviour (this case is sensitive to the choice
of initial conditions).

period-four motions, whereas coupled oscillators without an
electrical mirror will produce only period-two motions. Based
on this qualitatively different behavior, all AUVs can locally
recognize a self-reﬂection.

In the case of several emitting devices (i.e. m > 2), we
perform a numerical simulation of the system (11). Fig. 9
demonstrates the temporal behavior of this system with and
without the delayed term. The numerical value of non-delayed

ﬁrst and second bifurcations can be simultaneously shifted, as
shown in Fig. 6(b). Thus, the electrical mirror will produce

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experimental setup includes both the potential mode
operation, shown in Fig. 2(a) and 11, and the current mode op-
eration, shown in Fig. 2(b). Experiments have been performed
with 2-8 electric sensors. Sending and receiving electrodes are
placed in plastic tubes on a movable platform in aquarium, see
Fig. 10(b) for potential mode and Fig. 10(c) for current mode.
Electrodes are connected to electronic boards with analog
ﬁlters, ampliﬁers, DAC and ADC. During all experiments, the
water in aquarium was grounded and all electronic devices,
for example the water pump, were switched off. The laptops
used for data collection ran on batteries for each of the emit-
ting/receiving devices separately. Both potential and current
mode systems have been implemented in AUVs from CoCoRo
[14], subCULTron [40], [13] projects, shown in Figs. 13(a)
and 13(b), and several other developments [16], [12], such as
active electric mirror, see Fig. 26.

Two receiving electrodes in potential mode are connected to
a high-pass ﬁlter with the cut-off frequency 16 Hz, see Fig. 11.
The high-pass ﬁlter is needed to ﬁlter any unwanted constant
electrical ﬁelds that may be present
in the experimental
environment. The output of these ﬁlters is connected to the
differential inputs of an instrumental OpAmp. With a supply
voltage of ±5 V, the ampliﬁer is able to process input voltages
between ±10 V without saturation. The emitting electrodes are
connected to the outputs of a 2-channel DAC. This DAC can
generate an analog voltage between 0 V and +5 V on both

on ADC.

For mapping between the values of xn and the output
voltage ±5 V we use the coefﬁcient kDAC, calculated from
the condition |xn|kDAC < 2048 for the maximum positive and
negative values of xn. In contrast to simulations of coupled
maps, where all maps are iterated sequentially, real experi-
mental hardware iterates all maps in parallel. This imposes
several conditions on the timing of x, ξo
n . Since
all variables of the RHS of equation (7) are of time n, we
ﬁrst write x into the DAC, read ↓ ξ from the ADC and then
iterate the map. The measured output amplitudes of the signals
for the period two (xn = 0.08714, −0.11940) and chaotic
(xn = [0.25, .., −0.75]) modes are shown in Figs. 12(a) and
12(b). We measured the time needed to raise the level of
voltage, as shown in Fig. 12(c). Switching between ±0.7V ,
takes about 50µs. The minimum delay from the software
and SPI communication for switching between two levels of
voltage is about 20µs, see Fig. 12(d).

IV. EXPERIMENTS

A. Part 1: Dependency Between Emitted and Received Signals

n and ↓ ξi

In the ﬁrst experiment we investigated the dependency
between ↑ ξi
n in potential mode by varying the
distance d between two oscillating devices, see Fig. 14. The
ﬁrst device sends the generated signal ↑ ξi
n using Eq. (7)
without receiving ↓ ξi
the second device receives ↓ ξi
n;
n
without sending ↑ ξi
n.

We expect to see two different values of signals depending
on obstacles [10]. To explore this effect, two experiments are
performed: one with the electrodes installed on the glass wand
of the aquarium, Fig. 10(b), and one with the electrodes placed
in the middle of the aquarium, Fig. 14, where the distance to
the closest obstacle is twice the maximum distance between
electrodes. In both experiments the electrodes are placed at

B. Part 2: Calibration of The Coefﬁcient k1

The need for calibration is explained by the expression (3).
The self-signal in the term ξo
n should be compensated, so that
n − k1ξo

n = 0 in the absence of any other emitting devices.
In this experiment the position of electrodes is ﬁrst ﬁxed in
relation to the level of water and k1 is calculated for this setup.
For later experiments, the device auto-calibrates.

negative values of the xn. This difference can be explained
by nonsymmetrical gain in the operational ampliﬁer. Thus, in
the expression (3) we must consider the sign of xn. Iteration
from such initial conditions, close to the value of the long-
term dynamics, is recommended. Moreover, it depends also
on the delay between sending a value to the DAC and reading
the voltage from the ADC. Fig. 17(b) shows the values of
ξw
n − k1ξo
n with the calculated coefﬁcient k1 for α = 3.1.
We observe the appearance of structures for α > 3.4, which
will change the dynamics of original system in this area.

chaotic regions of the parameter α.

However, for the calculated values of α = 3.1, we observe
a compensation of the self-signal up to the level of noise (the
maximum amplitude of this term depends on calibration, it is

mapped to the output voltage of -4.7V ... +4.4V. The measured
level of noise is shown in Fig. 16(a). The maximum amplitude
of noise varied between +0.03V and -0.05V; we observed a
smaller level of noise (+0.01V and -0.02V) in the middle
of the aquarium and a bias of the average value to negative
(around -0.007V). This bias arises from the non-symmetrical
ampliﬁcation of the signal from the electrodes. Fig. 15 shows

a plot of experimental data for the ﬁrst position of electrodes.
Due to greater noise, we considered this as the worst case
for communication. The distance between electrodes was
increased from 5cm to 32.5cm in steps of 2.5cm. At d < 5cm,
the input voltage is around the saturation level of the ampliﬁer.
Values up to 25cm are above the noise level. The voltage
values for d > 25cm are within the noise areas and need
statistical processing. Thus, d=5,..., 25cm can be considered
as the working range of the system. At the distance between
emitting electrodes of 7.5cm, the communication distance is
about 3.3 body lengths in the worst case for potential mode.

Fig. 16 shows the decay of periodic signals for all measured
values of d for positions 1 and 2. We observe a larger variation
in the signal for position 1, moreover signal decay is higher
in the middle of aquarium.

1) Synchronization and Desynchronization of Oscillations:
A desynchronization effect appears for two reasons: ﬁrst, not
all the main clocks of the devices have exactly the same
frequency; second, the positive and negative pulses initially
overlap, since the oscillators start asynchronously. Potentially,
desynchronization of coupled oscillators is undesirable, how-
ever it can lead to several interesting effects. In Fig. 20 we
show two oscillograms of three devices, running Eq.(7) at
α = 3.1 and pulses of duration 2ms. We changed the clock

about ±5 · 10−3), see Fig. 17(b). This allows working with
even larger values of k2 in further experiments.

There are two strategies for using the coefﬁcient k1. Since it
is calculated only for some regions of xn, values outside this
region will increase noise and can change the dynamics of the
system, see Fig. 18(b). Thus, the ﬁrst strategy is to limit the
working region of xn. The second strategy is to calibrate k1
each time with values taken from, for example, a look-up table.
In further experiments the coefﬁcient k1 is auto-calibrated each
time when the device is switched on.

C. Part 3: Coupled Oscillators Mode

For tests of the coupled oscillator mode, all devices are pro-
grammed with the same program and xn values are read from
them. We performed three experiments: (1) synchronization
and desynchronization of oscillations, (2) different distances
between oscillating devices, (3) different numbers of oscillat-
ing devices. The experimental setup for these experiments is
shown in Fig. 19. All three devices D1-D3 were placed either
in a triangle or in a line at distance of d12, d23, d13 from
each other. Before each experiment, all devices self-calibrate

divider of each device to exhibit an approximately 0.2Hz shift
of frequencies. Thus, the periods of oscillations in different
devices can exactly overlap, can have inverse phases, see
Fig. 20(a), and can be shifted differently from each other, see
Fig. 20(b).

To conﬁrm the model (8) in Sec. II-A and our ideas regard-
ing adding and subtracting amplitudes in asynchronous mode,
two devices ran Eq.(7) with k2 = 0 (that is, without reading
values from the water). The third device reads the ADC
and measures the intensity of electric ﬁeld without emitting
functionality. We performed three measurements, shown in
Fig. 21(a). As expected, a spatially-dependent adding and

frequency in Fig. 21(a) we see a step-wise phase exchange.

by the high-pass ﬁlter. Another interesting effect is also visible
in Fig. 21(a); the left and right emitting devices have slightly
different waveforms, resulting in the symmetry breaking when
approaching the left or right sides of aquarium. Based on this
effect, a robot can distinguish between emitting devices and
thus navigate.

For k2 (cid:54)= 0 the phase desynchronization appears as a switch
between two amplitudes of period-two motion. To make this
effect more visible, we increase the duration of pulses to 10ms
and plot the values ↓ ξi
n from the water for two oscillating
devices, as shown in Fig. 22. Increasing of amplitudes in the

ﬁrst device, and at the same time, decreasing of amplitudes in
the second device are clearly visible.

2) Different Distances Between Oscillating Devices: To
measure distances between emitting devices, we can apply two
approaches: ﬁrst, one based on a phase desynchronization for
k2 = 0 and second, one based on measuring the amplitude of
xn, as described in Sec. II-B. Both approaches worked well
in the test environment. Fig. 23 shows the difference between
the max and min of the amplitudes for k2 = 0. In contrast

have been performed, see Fig. 24. We clearly see a locking of

phases and amplitudes for all three oscillators. The distance
between devices can be obtained by measuring the frequency
of pulses.

3) Different Number of Oscillating Devices: As indicated
in Sec. II-B, either the number of devices or distances between
them can be measured. In this case we were interested in the
number of devices and repeat the experiment with a strong
positive coupling coefﬁcient k2. However, in this experiment
all oscillating devices were placed in a line, at distances of
d13 = 22cm and d12 = d23 = 11cm. Moreover, we slightly
unbalanced oscillators 1 and 2 by varying the coefﬁcient k1.
First two close oscillators 1 and 2 were turned on, and became
synchronized, see Fig. 25(a). Oscillators 1 and 3, at a distance
of 22cm, were only slightly perturbed in the period-two
behavior. After this, we turned on oscillator 3. The behavior
of all devices changed to a mode, where synchronization and
desynchronization phases exchange, see Fig. 25(b).

max and min amplitudes, α = 3.1, k2 = 0. (a) 10cm between

to the measurement shown in Fig. 21, in this experiment we
measured the intensity of ﬁeld simultaneously with the self-
emitted signals. The resolution of this approach is primarily
deﬁned by measurement accuracy and the ampliﬁcation factor
of input electronics.

To demonstrate the approach with k2 (cid:54)= 0, we used a
strong positive coupling coefﬁcient k2, which leads to global
synchronization and changes in qualitative behavior. Three ex-
periments for d12 = d23 = d13 = 25cm (period-two behavior),
for d12 = d23 = d13 = 15 and for d12 = d23 = d13 = 10cm

Generally, when all devices have different oscillation pa-
rameters, caused for example by self-calibration of k1 or by
different distances between devices, we observe a different
period of oscillation, as shown in Fig. 25(a). This leads to
an appearance of temporal desynchronization, after which all
devices resynchronize. This mode can be used for detection of
a group of underwater devices, even at the furthest range of

Moreover, by measuring the degree of desynchro-
nization, it is possible to draw conclusions about the spatial
distribution of devices.

D. Part 4: Electrical Mirror Mode

For experiments in electrical mirror mode, one or two
devices oscillated and one device represented the electrical
mirror implemented as an independent system, see Fig. 26.
All devices had the same time interval (2ms) as in other
experiments. The mirror device ﬁrst senses the electrical ﬁeld
without sending its own signal and stores the received values in
internal array. After this, the value received from the previous
step (generally the value xn−γ, where γ is the time delay)
was sent to the emitting electrodes. After 2ms, the emitting
electrodes were switched off,
the ADC read the value of
electrical ﬁeld, and the cycle repeated. For this experiment it is
necessary to calibrate: (a) a proportional coefﬁcient between
the received and emitted values, ﬁrst so as not to saturate the
ampliﬁers, and second to provide a possible large interaction
radius; (b) time interval when the emitting electrodes are
switched on and off.

Fig. 26. Active electric mirror in potential mode.

In the ﬁrst experiment we intended to conﬁrm the model
(12) from Sec. II-C regarding time-delayed feedback with
two devices (one oscillator and one electrical mirror). Fig. 27
shows values received from the oscillating device. The os-
cillating device implements Eq. (7). The mirroring device
returns −xn−1 each time, whereas we changed k2 = 0.5 and
k2 = −0.5 in the feedback term of the oscillating device.
We observed a characteristic behavior in the delayed feedback
(see also Fig. 8(a)) when the signal is compensated to zero (as

shown in Fig. 27(a)) or when the amplitude of the period-two
motion was increased (as shown in Fig. 27(b)) for positive
and negative values of the feedback signal respectively. The
values of the coefﬁcient k3 in Eq.(12) differ from those shown
here, due to ampliﬁcations, losses in the water/mirror and other
factors; they need to be experimentally calibrated.

In Fig. 28 two devices D2 and D3 oscillate and D1 acts
as an electrical mirror. First, D2 and D3 are synchronized, as
shown in Fig. 28(a), then the mirror device D1 is turned on;
see Fig. 28(b). We observed a crash of global synchronization

and a change in the oscillating pattern. Comparing the results
with Fig. 24, we see that the global synchronization pattern
enables robots to recognize whether the signal is emitted by
another swarm or their own signal is reﬂected by the mirror.
The system is also sensitive to a non-delayed signal. In
Fig. 29 we demonstrate the case where the mirroring device
returns −xn and the oscillating device has the coefﬁcient k2 =
0.5. Oscillations are sensitive to the presence of this feedback
signal even at the boundary of the sensing range.

V. PART 5: CURRENT MODE SENSOR

Experiments in the current mode are aimed at demonstrating
coupling by physical means (by interferences of electric ﬁelds
in water), and sensitivity of common electric ﬁelds to place-
ment and movement of dipoles and dielectric objects in such a

VI. CONCLUSION

This work explores the behavior of nonlinear oscillators,
coupled through an electric ﬁeld in water. The ±5V driven
hardware is capable of generating and direct sensing an electric
ﬁeld within 3x-4x body lengths (size of electric dipole – the
distance between electrodes). The coupled mode of different
oscillating devices enables extending this distance up to 5x-6x
in potential mode and >10x in current mode in fresh water. We
have demonstrated ﬁve different schemes for potential and cur-
rent sensing, where two effects have an impact on the behavior
of nonlinear oscillators: phase desychronization of pulses and
global synchronization of amplitudes. A combination of both
effects enables either the sensing of distances or the number
of emitting devices. Analysis of temporal patterns allows the
devices to draw more complex conclusions about the spatial
conﬁgurations of AUVs or dielectric objects in the sensing
area. Moreover, temporal synchronization of amplitudes makes
it possible to coordinate activities of AUVs without global
communication.

Using one device as an electric mirror to reﬂect the received
signals can change the qualitative behavior of the coupled
system. The main argument for these experiments is that by
comparing the self- and received signals, each AUV can rec-
ognize its membership in the group. This approach underlies

common ﬁeld. General setup is shown in Fig. 30 and include 8
electric dipoles combined in two groups on movable holders.
Each dipole has own ﬁxed oscillating frequency between 70
and 450 Hz. Since the coupling part of Eq. (5) is implemented
in ’physical way’ (similar to the case k2 = 0 in Sec. II-A),
the current mode is simpler than the potential mode, however
is also less controllable. The current between electrodes at
applied potential is calculated as impedance (in RMS form for
AC signals). Sensing is performed by the last pair of dipoles
and is shown in Figs. 31. Size of dipole is related to dipole-
dipole distance as 1:8, to the size of the whole group as 1:24,
and to size of the sensing area as 1:40. Due to larger sensing
area, this setup has a smaller dipole size and is also used to
study electrochemical and optical effects in ﬂuidic media [41]
and biological organisms [42].

Fig. 30. Experimental setup for current mode sensors with 8 dipoles.
Dielectric object in a common ﬁeld is shown.

Since the conﬁguration of common electric ﬁeld is sensitive
to positions of dipoles and geometry of ﬁeld with included
obstacles, this can be used for sensing purposes. Fig. 31(a)
demonstrates electrochemical dynamics measured in the last
dipole in cases if a dielectric object or dipoles are moved
in the sensing area. Inﬂuence of dipoles is larger and this
allows separating signal levels for group-external objects and
for group-internal dipoles.

All dipoles oscillate at different frequencies and the interfer-
ence pattern of electric ﬁeld is speciﬁc to each of these dipoles.
Fig. 31(b) demonstrate examples of such patterns, detectable
on the level of a single dipole. This approach can be used

tion and collective recognition of the ’self’ and ’non-self’.
Experiments demonstrated a good correlation with analytical
results, this can be used for designing collective capabilities
of larger underwater systems.
