ABSTRACT

A critical analysis and comparison of diﬀerent methods for obtaining point spread function (PSF)
photometry are carried out. Deep ACS observations of NGC 3370 were reduced using four distinct
approaches. These reductions explore a number of methodological diﬀerences: software packages
(DAOPHOT and DOLPHOT), input images (individual and stacked frames), PSF models (synthetic
and empirical), and aperture correction methods (automatic and manual). A comparison of the pho-
tometry leads to the following results: 1) Photometric incompleteness between individual reductions
shows only a minimal diﬀerence (<10%). 2) Statistical errors are 20% to 30% smaller for DAOPHOT
runs on stacked frames than DOLPHOT runs on individual frames. 3) Statistical errors assigned di-
rectly by the photometry codes are 25% to 50% smaller than the errors measured from artiﬁcial star
tests. 4) Systematic errors are magnitude dependent and become larger at the faint end, at the level
of σs ∼ 0.1 mag. 5) The automatic aperture correction routines in DOLPHOT result in a signiﬁcant
systematic error (σs ∼ 0.05 mag). 6) Individual reductions agree well at the 0.02 mag level when
the systematic errors are properly corrected through artiﬁcial star tests. The reasonable agreement
between the reductions leads to important implications that i) the reduction dependent errors can be
reduced to a 1% level in the luminosity distance scale, and ii) the stacked frame photometry can be a
good means to study non-variable stars in external galaxies.

1. INTRODUCTION

Measuring accurate ﬂuxes of resolved stellar objects
is one of the most fundamental steps in observational
astronomy. This is due to the nature of astronomy—the
information content of stellar objects comes primarily
from their electromagnetic radiation. Measuring this
radiation is therefore the ﬁrst task in deriving stellar
physical properties (e.g. temperature) that can be used
to constrain stellar evolution models. When stars are
observed in nearby resolved galaxies this ﬂux can then
be combined with stellar distance indicators (i.e., stan-
dard candles) to determine their accurate luminosity dis-
tances, which can then form the basis for determining
cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble constant
(H0).

There have been increasing eﬀorts to determine the
local value of the Hubble constant using stellar distance

indicators. And, remarkable progress has been made in
the past few years:

1. Geometric distances to the local calibrator galax-
ies have increased in precision (LMC – Pietrzy´nski
et al. (2019), SMC – Graczyk et al. (2020),
NGC 4258 – Reid et al. (2019), Milky Way cali-
brators – Gaia Collaboration et al. (2021));

2. The Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method
has been used to determine the distances to Type
Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies (e.g., Freedman
et al. 2019, 2020), providing a measurement of H0
that is independent of the Cepheid distance scale.
3. A larger number of local SN Ia calibrators and host
galaxies have been observed (19 SNe Ia – Freed-
man (2021) and 42 SNe Ia – Riess et al. (2021)).
The quoted accuracy of the Hubble constant measured
from stellar distance indicators is now nearing ∼1% pre-
cision, corresponding to only ∼0.02 mag in the luminos-
ity scale.

The improved accuracy of the local distance scale is
encouraging. However, it should be noted that these
measurements rest on an uncertain interface, the pho-

tometry. For example, the mean photometric error for
a single TRGB star at ∼20 Mpc is σF 814W ∼ 0.15 mag
in HST imaging (e.g., Jang et al. 2018). For Cepheid
variables, the dispersion in the NIR period-luminosity
relation is on average ∼0.3 mag for galaxies in the same
distance range (e.g., Riess et al. 2016). These individual
errors are much larger than the ﬁnal error of the Hubble
constant. While statistical errors can be reduced by ana-
lyzing a larger number of stars, there may be systematic
issues that can not be reduced by increasing the sample
size and are more diﬃcult to identify and constrain.

Stellar photometry is an art that requires stringent
control of errors (e.g., Stetson 1987). The theory of
stellar photometry is straightforward: one must deter-
mine the local sky background and then measure the ﬂux
excess using a ﬁxed aperture (aperture photometry) or
a pre-calculated Point-Spread-Function model (PSF ﬁt-
ting photometry). However, from the very ﬁrst step, the
practical implementation is complex, and many choices
must be made. For example, there is no single sky an-
nulus that is optimal for all degrees of stellar crowding.
Even using a given sky annulus, a number of statistical
schemes can be considered to ﬁnd a representative value
of the sky background: mean, median, and mode1, and
one may further consider diﬀerent values for the sigma
clipping of outlier pixels. In a crowded ﬁeld, unresolved
sources contribute to the sky background, making a gra-
dient within the sky annuli. These issues are all possible
sources of error.

Artiﬁcial star tests have been the preferred method to
assess the robustness of crowded-ﬁeld photometry (e.g.,
Stetson & Harris 1988). These tests are performed by
injecting a large number of artiﬁcial stars into the im-
ages and then recovering them in the same manner as
real stars. This process is computationally expensive,
but it does deliver robust estimates of photometric per-
formance (e.g., completeness, random errors, and sys-
tematic errors). However, it does not fully encapsulate
the all potential sources of error. One example is the
error associated with the use of incomplete PSF models.
Model PSFs do not exactly match the intrinsic image
PSFs, so there is an uncertainty in the measured ﬂux of
real sources due to the diﬀerence in PSFs. It is not pos-
sible to measure this bias from artiﬁcial star tests alone,
since the artiﬁcial stars are injected using the model
PSF, which diﬀers from the real sources.

A complementary and alternative approach is to un-
dertake and compare independent reductions, from dif-

approximation can also be considered: mode ≈ 3 × median − 2 ×
mean (e.g., DAOPHOT).

ferent input parameter sets, or ideally from diﬀerent
software packages (Freedman et al. 2001). Indeed, such
tests have been carried out in the literature2. These
studies often found small, but non-negligible magnitude-
dependent oﬀsets, such that the faint stars show larger
discrepancy (∆mag (cid:46) 0.05). The faint side of photome-
try is a sensitive test area for systematic eﬀects. The ob-
served discrepancy could be due to the diﬀerent photo-
metric processing or the systematic bias associated with
the stellar crowding and sky subtraction. The latter can
be quantiﬁed through artiﬁcial star tests. Therefore, it
would be ideal to combine both approaches—artiﬁcial
star tests and independent reductions—to address sys-
tematic issues in photometry whenever practical.

In this paper, we now present detailed photometry
tests applied to deep observations of NGC 3370 taken
with ACS/WFC on board the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST ). NGC 3370 is a moderately inclined late-type
disk galaxy (Figure 1) and has been host to a Type Ia
Supernova, SN 1994ae. The ACS observations for this
galaxy provide a unique opportunity for this study since
two compelling stellar distance indicators have been
applied to the same dataset and resulted in accurate
distances: Cepheids (Riess et al. 2005, (m − M )0 =
32.29 ± 0.06) and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch
(TRGB) (Jang & Lee 2017b, (m − M )0 = 32.25 ± 0.04).
We reduced this ACS dataset in a number of indepen-
dent ways, thereby allowing us to compare photometric
performance and to test possible reduction-dependent
uncertainties.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes
the ACS imaging data and data reduction procedures.
We provide details of how we obtained PSF photome-
try from the individual reductions, and how we carried
out aperture corrections and artiﬁcial star tests. Sec-
tion 3 presents a detailed comparison of photometric
performance (e.g., completeness, precision, and accu-
racy) measured from artiﬁcial stars. Furthermore, we
examine magnitudes of real stars to see if there are any
reduction-dependent systematics. The primary results
are summarized in Section 4.

2. DATA AND DATA PROCESSING

2.1. Archival Image Data

2 For HST images, we identiﬁed the following studies: Kelson et
al. (1996); Silbermann et al. (1996); Phelps et al. (1998); Kelson
et al. (1999); Silbermann et al. (1999); Dolphin (2000); Rejkuba
et al. (2005); Monelli et al. (2010); Hatt et al. (2017); Jang &
Lee (2017a); Jang et al. (2018); Filion et al. (2020); Jang et al.
(2021).

the reference frame. The aligned flc images were then
passed into Astrodrizzle to generate stacked drc im-
ages. We prepared one drizzled image from the individ-
ual F 814W images to serve as the reference frame for the
DOLPHOT reductions (Phot A and B, see next section
for details) using the default pixel scale of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)05. Addi-
tionally, we prepared a drizzled image in each F 555W
and F 814W to perform drizzled frame photometry in
DAOPHOT (Phot C and D). These images were gen-
erated using a slightly ﬁner pixel scale of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)03, which
mitigates the undersampling of the ACS point spread
function (PSF). All drizzled images were generated us-
ing a final pixfrac of 1 and final kernel of ‘square’
(default).

green and blue channels are taken from F814W, F555W, and
F435W, respectively. North is up and east is to the left. The
dashed ellipse indicates the boundary between the inner and
outer regions used in this study (SM A = 2(cid:48)).

The images for NGC 3370 used in this study were
downloaded from the MAST archive. Observations were
taken with the ACS/WFC instrument on HST in three
ﬁlters: F 435W (9,600s), F 555W (61,240s), and F 814W
(24,000s). The F 435W data3 were only used to make
the color composite image shown in Figure 1, and not
used in the subsequent analysis. The F 555W and
F 814W data were originally aimed at detecting Cepheid
variables (PID: 9351 and 10802, PI: A. Riess), and here
we use them to carry out photometry tests. All of
the observations, except for some short F 555W expo-
sures (3,640s), were taken in 2003. This means that the
dataset is one of early applications of ACS (installed in
2002), when the instrument had better sensitivity and
lower CTE losses.

Individual frames were processed before extracting the
photometry, following the methods described in Jang et
al. (2021). To brieﬂy summarize, we carried out initial
PSF photometry on the individual flc images, select-
ing bright stellar objects. These objects were then used
as the alignment sources for Tweakreg in DrizzlePac
2.0 (Gonzaga et al. 2012; Avila et al. 2015). This pro-
cess found that some images were not properly aligned
with a measurable oﬀset of ∼1 pixel with respect to

2.2. Point Spread Function (PSF) Photometry

There are two possible approaches to extracting pho-
tometry from multiple images of the same ﬁeld: 1) Use
individual images and photometer them simultaneously.
The mean magnitude is then determined from the indi-
vidual ﬂux measurements. 2) Make a co-added (stacked)
frame in each band and perform the photometric mea-
surements on the stack.

The ﬁrst approach allows one to generate time-series
photometry of variable stars. Because input images are
only passed through the basic processing steps (e.g.,
bias correction, ﬂat ﬁelding), the intrinsic image PSF
is preserved. This helps in achieving high photomet-
ric accuracy when the image PSF is well characterized
by synthetic models, as is the case with HST data.
DOLPHOT is a modiﬁed version of HSTphot (Dolphin
2000) and has a number of useful routines to simulta-
neously photometer individual HST images using syn-
thetic PSFs (e.g., TinyTim PSFs). It has been widely
used in recent studies (e.g., Tully et al. 2009; Dalcan-
ton et al. 2009; Radburn-Smith et al. 2011; Anand et al.
2021) and it was also tested in this study.

The second approach has been considered to be
sub-optimal for accurate photometry because the pixel
counts are resampled during the stacking process. How-
ever, improved image processing techniques in recent
years (e.g., DrizzlePac) have made stacked frame pho-
tometry more robust. This approach requires signiﬁ-
cantly reduced computing resources than photometering
the individual images simultaneously. In general, empir-
ical PSFs, which can be constructed from bright stars in
the stacked frame, are used to carry out PSF photom-
etry (but see Phot D, as described below and in Table
1.). Stacked frame photometry has been used to reduce

HST data in many studies4 and it is more common in
ground-based surveys (e.g., Dark Energy Survey (Burke
et al. 2018), Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Pro-
gram (Aihara et al. 2018)).

In this study, we tested both approaches with a num-
ber of parameter changes. The details are listed below
and also summarized in Table 1.

• Phot A: uses DOLPHOT with individual frame
flc images. The input parameters are listed
in Table 2. They are consistent with those in
the DOLPHOT/ACS User’s Guide, except for
SigFinal=2.5. This is slightly lower than the
default value (3.5) and makes sure that all of
the detected stars (SigFind=2.5) are listed in the
ﬁnal catalog. The PSF to 0.(cid:48)5 aperture correction
is measured using the DOLPHOT implemented
routines (ApCor=1). The local sky background is
measured with Fitsky=2. This is relevant to most
of the DOLPHOT processing in the literature.

• Phot B: same as the Phot A processing, but with
manual aperture corrections (see Section 2.3 for
details).

• Phot C: uses drizzled stacked frames ( drc) to
measure stellar ﬂux. A single pass of DAOPHOT
(FIND - PHOT - ALLSTAR -
PSF photometry
ALLFRAME) is carried out (Stetson 1987, 1994).
We used a readout noise of 4.98e− and a gain of
1.0e−/ADU, as listed in the header of the drizzled
images. PSF images were constructed empirically
using ∼20 isolated, bright stars in the drizzled
frames. Source coordinates are determined from
the montaged frame with a detection threshold of

the outer region with SM A > 1.(cid:48)3, to avoid high stellar crowding. The concentration index (C) is deﬁned as the magnitude
diﬀerence (in flc) between the small and large aperture radii: C = m(r = 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)04) − m(r = 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)125). The red line is a histogram
for sources brighter than 24 mag in each ﬁlter. A strong plume of point sources is clearly seen at C ∼ 1.1. Sources in the cyan
area were used for the aperture correction after a careful visual inspection.

∼3σ, where the sky ﬂuctuation is measured in the
outskirts of the galaxy (SM A ∼ 3(cid:48)).

• Phot D: same as the Phot C processing, except
that the TinyTim PSFs were used. We used the
”addstars” task in DOLPHOT to inject TinyTim
PSFs on individual flc images and then drizzled
them in the same way as the original images. We
note that the injected PSFs are corrected for the
diﬀerence between the image PSFs and the mod-
els, measured from the prior DOLPHOT run (i.e.,
central pixel adjustment). This increases the pho-
tometric accuracy.

There are three local sky ﬁtting options generally used
in DOLPHOT: Fitsky=1, 2, and 3. The Fitsky=1 op-
tion measures the sky background prior to each photom-
etry measurement with an annulus given by img RSky
(=15 and 35 pixels). Sky measurements in DOLPHOT
are sigma-clipped means, with SkySig (=2.25) being
the sigma used for the clipping. The Fitsky=2 option
ﬁts the sky ﬁrst, and the star second (i.e., two single-
parameter ﬁts). The sky annulus is given by img RSky2
(=4 and 10 pixels), typically smaller than img RSky used
for Fitsky=1 and 3. The Fitsky=3 option makes a sin-
gle ﬁt for the sky and star simultaneously (i.e., one two-
parameter ﬁt). In theory, Fitsky=3 with img RAper=10
should be very similar to Fitsky=2 with img RAper=3
and img RSky2=4 10, but Fitsky=2 is signiﬁcantly more

robust in extremely crowded ﬁelds (A. Dolphin 2021,
In this study, we chose the
private communication).
Fitsky=2 option to simultaneously process the inner
crowded and outer sparse regions of NGC 3370.

DAOPHOT measures the local sky background from
the mode of pixel counts after sigma clipping. Here the
mode is an approximate estimate with an empirical re-
lationship: mode = 3 × median − 2 × mean.

2.3. Aperture correction

The ﬁnite sizes of PSF models and sky annuli used for
photometry require an additional ﬂux correction which
is called the “aperture correction”. For the photometry
of HST data, the correction procedure is divided into
two steps: 1) a correction from the PSF ﬁt magnitude
to an aperture magnitude at ﬁnite radius, and 2) a cor-
rection from the ﬁnite aperture magnitude to inﬁnity.
The second step can be made with the encircled energy
values provided by STScI, so this section focuses on the
ﬁrst step, an empirical determination of the aperture
correction out to a ﬁnite radius.

The general procedure of the aperture correction is
to select bright and isolated stars (hereafter, photomet-
ric standards) and then compare their aperture magni-
tudes with the PSF ﬁt magnitudes. The mean magni-
tude diﬀerence in each band (or in each exposure) is
identiﬁed as the aperture correction. DOLPHOT pro-
vides an automated routine to do the necessary correc-
tion (ApCor=1), which is used in Phot A. For the other

reductions (Phot B – D), we applied the aperture cor-
rection determined manually, following the method de-
scribed in Jang et al. (2021).

Figure 2 displays the selection of bright point sources
we used for the aperture correction. The concentra-
tion index, C, is the magnitude diﬀerence between the
small and large aperture radii. This simple parameter
is very eﬃcient at distinguishing between point sources
and marginally resolved sources (e.g., Whitmore et al.
1999), as shown in the study of globular clusters in
the Coma cluster (Lee & Jang 2016a). We derived the
concentration index from the photometry of individual
flc images with aperture radii of r = 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)04 and 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)125.
The histogram of the detected sources (red line) shows
a prominent peak at C ∼ 1.05, which we identiﬁed
as point sources. We selected 15 and 14 bright point
sources in the F 814W and F 555W bands respectively,
after a careful visual inspection of images and the light
growth curves.

Figure 3 shows the selected bright stars in the drizzled
frame. Their r = 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)25 aperture magnitudes are listed in
Table 3. Photometry was carried out on both individ-
ual ( flc) and drizzled ( drc) frames. We found that
there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two image
sets. The mean (median) diﬀerence in F 814W is 0.0045
(0.0040) mag with a standard deviation of 0.0063 mag.
The same calculation in F 555W gives a mean (median)
diﬀerence of –0.0017 (0.0015) mag with a standard de-
viation of 0.0132 mag. This good agreement in aperture
photometry indicates that the stellar ﬂux is well pre-
served after resampling images with DrizzlePac.

With the r = 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)25 aperture magnitudes in hand, we
calibrated the PSF ﬁt magnitudes. Here we separated
the image types for the correction: PSF ﬁt magnitudes
from the individual frames (Phot A and B) or drizzled
frames (Phot C and D) were combined with aperture
magnitudes from the same image frames. The correc-
tions from the ﬁnite aperture magnitudes (r = 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)25) to
inﬁnity were made with those from Bohlin (2016) : –
0.1726 mag for F 814W and –0.1537 mag for F 555W .
We adopt photometric zero-points from the webtool5
provided by STScI: 25.525 for F 814W and 25.725 for
F 555W .

2.4. Artiﬁcial star tests

Extensive artiﬁcial star tests have been carried out
to estimate errors and completeness of our photome-
try. We made a list of 5 × 105 artiﬁcial stars that
has a uniform distribution in the color range of 0.5 <

F 555W − F 814W < 2 and the magnitude range of
23.0 < F 814W < 30.5 mag. The spatial distribution
of the artiﬁcial stars was set to mimic the real stars: we
selected real stars with F 814W ≤ 29 mag and used their
coordinates with random shifts of |∆| ≤ 5(cid:48)(cid:48) along the X
and Y directions. We used the same list of the artiﬁcial
stars for Phot A – D.

The artiﬁcial stars were injected into images and re-
covered in the same way as was done for the real
stars. For the DAOPHOT-based processing (Phot C
and D), we injected a small number of artiﬁcial stars
(N ∼ 10, 000) at a time to preserve the degree of stellar
crowding. Instead, we repeated the test for 50 times to
sample the full list of the artiﬁcial stars (N = 5 × 105).
In the case of the DOLPHOT-based processing (Phot A
and B), such an issue is not present, because the code
performs the test one star at a time.

Figure 4 shows the results of the artiﬁcial star tests for
Phot A. We used sources that passed the point source

ric diagnostic parameters returned from DOLPHOT and
DAOPHOT and chose the sharpness parameter as our
criterion for the point source selection.

Figure 5 displays an illustration of our point source se-
lection criterion applied to Phot A. We used the sharp-
ness distribution of artiﬁcial stars as a proxy for the
genuine point sources (top panel). Red dots indicate the
median sharpness values in each magnitude bin. Their
standard deviations are marked by error bars. We de-
termine the point source selection criteria by ﬁtting the
upper and lower ends of the error bars (yellow lines)
with a constant + exponential function as follows:

SharpnessF 814W = α + β × exp(F 814W − γ).

(1)

Here we ﬁt the upper and lower boundaries separately,
because the sharpness distributions are not always sym-
metric. For the upper boundary, we ﬁxed α = 0.03, and
found β = 0.00023 and γ = 22.08. The same scheme
for the lower boundary gives α = −0.03, β = −0.00032
and γ = 22.15. We then applied these selection criteria
to the real stars (bottom panel). Sources between the
two boundary lines were considered as point sources.
We applied the same methodology to other reductions
(Phot A–D). The derived values are listed in Table 4.

In addition to the sharpness-based selection above, we
applied type = 1 (good star) for Phot A and B. This ad-
ditional cut eﬀectively eliminates spurious detections in
the DOLPHOT processing. DAOPHOT does not pro-
vide the type parameter, so we applied the sharpness-
based cut only (Phot C and D).

It is worth mentioning that there is no single setting
of point source selection criteria that is optimal for all
local environments and all scientiﬁc goals. The selection
criteria adopted in this study are designed to sample
stars in both the disk and halo simultaneously, and to
apply a homogeneous selection (i.e., all sharpness based)
to independent reductions as much as possible. Our
approach is rather simple and straightforward compared
with the selection schemes in the literature that are often

selection criteria (details are given in the next sec-
tion). We found that the photometry is moderately deep
with a 50% recovery rate at F 814W ∼ 28.1 mag (top
panel). The mean diﬀerences in F 814W magnitude and
(F 555W − F 814W ) color between the injected and re-
covered stars are measured to be small (< 0.05 mag) for
F 814W < 29 mag (middle and bottom panels). In Sec-
tion 3 we explore how the photometric errors and com-
pleteness vary depending on the spatial selection, color
selection, and the data reduction methods (Phot A – D).

2.5. Point source selection

There are several types of sources in the raw pho-
tometry catalogs of the NGC 3370 ﬁeld: stars, spatially-
resolved star clusters, blended sources, background
galaxies, and false stellar detections. Selecting reliable
point sources (≈ stars) is one of the main steps before
comparing PSF photometry. We inspected photomet-

based on several diagnostic parameters (e.g., error, chi-
square, roundness, and crowding). We found, however,
that our selection is good enough for our purposes of
comparing photometry between individual reductions,
as discussed in the next section.

3. COMPARISON OF PHOTOMETRY

In this section, we used real and artiﬁcial star data
to assess photometric performance of individual reduc-
tions. We start by analyzing the artiﬁcial star data in
terms of recovery rates (Section 3.1), statistical errors
(Section 3.2), and systematic errors (Section 3.3), which
are indicators of completeness, precision and accuracy,
respectively. We then show a star-by-star comparison of
real stars and their CMDs (Section 3.4).

3.1. Photometric completeness

In Figure 6, we present completeness of our photom-
etry for the inner (left) and outer (right) regions of the
NGC 3370 ﬁeld. The recovery rates taken from individ-
ual reductions (Phot A – D) are indicated as a function
of input F 814W magnitudes. Error bars represent the
1σ statistical uncertainty in each magnitude bin. They
are mostly smaller than the symbol size.

It is obvious (and expected) that the inner region
(1(cid:48) < SM A ≤ 2(cid:48)) has lower recovery rates than the
outer region (SM A > 2(cid:48)) regardless of the reduction
method. This is most likely due to the high stellar
crowding at the disk region, where the surface bright-
ness is several magnitudes brighter than the outer halo
ﬁeld (e.g., Cantiello et al. 2009). The 80% recovery rates

are measured at F 814W ≈ 26.5 and ≈ 28 mag in the
inner and outer regions, respectively.

Individual reductions show notable features in their
respective star recovery rates. First, Phot A and B show
almost identical completeness curves in both inner and
outer regions (solid lines). This is explained by the simi-
larity in the two photometry methods: both Phot A and
B are based on the DOLPHOT processing with individ-
ual frame images. The only diﬀerence is that Phot A
has aperture correction determined automatically from
the code itself (ApCor = 1), and Phot B is based on
the manual aperture correction. The aperture correc-
tion typically amounts to a few hundreds of magnitudes,
so Phot A and B should have similar photometric per-
formance, in recovery rates, statistical and systematic
errors. Phot C and D are in the same vein. They were
reduced using the same code (DAOPHOT) and the same
images (drizzled stacked frames). A small diﬀerence is
the PSF models: empirical PSFs for Phot C and syn-
thetic TinyTim PSFs for Phot D. The good agreement
between their completeness curves (dashed lines) indi-
cates that the choice of PSF models does not meaning-
fully change the recovery rates.

Second, there is a systematic diﬀerence between the
two groups of photometry: DOLPHOT runs on indi-
vidual frames (Phot A and B) and DAOPHOT runs
on stacked frames (Phot C and D). Photometry at the
bright side of F 814W (cid:46) 25 mag is almost complete
in all the cases. The systematic diﬀerence becomes

(cid:46) F 814W (cid:46) 28.5 mag, Phot C and D are more com-
plete, showing ∼5% (up to ∼10%) higher recovery rates
than Phot A and B. This trend is seen in both inner and
outer regions. The completeness curves are crossed over
at the faint side (F 814W (cid:38) 29 mag) showing higher
recovery rates for Phot A and B than Phot C and D.
We note, however, that photometry near the detection
limit is easily contaminated by false-positive detections
(e.g., sky ﬂuctuations) so that the recovery rates in this
magnitude range are less reliable.

In summary, we found a reasonable agreement in pho-
tometric completeness between independent reductions.
While we detected a small systematic diﬀerence in some
cases, the diﬀerence is not observed across the entire
magnitude range and doesn’t signiﬁcantly change the
general shape of the completeness curves.

3.2. Photometric precision

The statistical (random) error of individual reductions
were derived from the artiﬁcial star data. We used the
standard deviation of the magnitude diﬀerence between
the injected and recovered stars (e.g., error bars in Fig-
ure 4) as a proxy for the statistical errors. This approach
is straightforward and provides robust estimates of pho-
tometric errors taking into account both the Poisson
photon statistics and stellar crowding (e.g., Stetson &
Harris 1988; Gallart et al. 1996; Dolphin 2002; Makarov
et al. 2006).

Figure 7 displays the statistical errors for the inner
(left) and outer (right) regions of NGC 3370. It is not
surprising that the inner crowded region shows larger
errors than the outer region. The diﬀerence is about
60%, which means that the errors of the inner region
are on average 1.6 times larger than those of the outer
region in the same magnitude bin.

We also found that there is a systematic diﬀerence
between individual reductions such that Phot A and B
have larger statistical errors than Phot C and D. To
better show the diﬀerence, we plot the error ratios be-
tween Phot A and Phot D in the bottom panels.
It is
clearly seen that Phot A has about 20% (for the in-
ner region) – 35% (for the outer region) larger errors
than Phot D. Similar error ratios can be achieved with
Phot B and C, as their errors are almost the same as
those of Phot A and D, respectively. This result indi-
cates that DAOPHOT runs on stacked frames could de-
liver higher photometric precision (i.e., smaller statisti-
cal errors) than DOLPHOT runs on individual frames.
We next explore the statistical errors computed in-
ternally from the photometry codes. Figure 8 shows a
comparison of errors derived from two independent ap-
proaches: artiﬁcial star tests (ﬁlled circles with lines)
and internal routines in the photometry codes (gray
dots and open circles). We chose two representative
reductions, Phot A (top) and Phot B (bottom), to see
the errors in the inner (left) and outer (right) region

directly from the photometry codes (gray dots and open circles). Gray dots indicate the errors of individual stars assigned
by either DOLPHOT or DAOPHOT. Their median errors in each magnitude bin are marked by open circles. The left and
right panels show the results from the inner (1(cid:48) < SM A ≤ 2(cid:48)) and outer regions (SM A > 2(cid:48)), respectively. We choose two
representative reductions: Phot A (top panels) and Phot D (bottom panels).

of NGC 3370. We found that the internally computed
errors are smaller than the errors determined from the
artiﬁcial star experiments in all cases. The average ratio
between the two error estimates in the outer region is
1.25 for Phot A and 1.38 for Phot D. The inner crowded
region shows a more signiﬁcant diﬀerence with larger
error ratios: 1.94 for Phot A and 1.99 for Phot D. This
result indicates that artiﬁcial star experiments are crit-
ical to properly estimate photometric errors; using the
errors computed directly from photometry codes under-
estimates the true errors, especially in crowded ﬁelds.

3.3. Photometric accuracy

We estimate the photometric accuracy (systematic er-
ror) by examining the magnitude oﬀset between the in-
jected and recovered artiﬁcial stars (i.e., red circles in
Figure 4). The results from the inner (left) and outer
(right) regions of NGC 3370 are shown in Figure 9. A
few distinguishable features are evident. First, the sys-
tematic errors for Phot A are almost identical to those
of Phot B in both inner and outer regions. Similarly, a
good match is seen between the errors of Phot C and D.

This, again, is due to the similarity in data processing,
as discussed in previous sections.

frames

Second,

there is a stark diﬀerence between the
two groups of photometry: DOLPHOT-based re-
(Phot A and B),
ductions with individual
and DAOPHOT-based reductions with stacked frames
(Phot C and D). At the faint magnitude end (F 814W (cid:38)
27 mag), the oﬀsets have opposite signs: negative oﬀsets
for Phot A and B (i.e., fainter recovered magnitudes),
and positive oﬀsets for Phot C and D (i.e., brighter re-
covered magnitudes). The brighter recovered magni-
tudes is naturally expected at the faint side as unre-
solved stars below the detection limit will contribute to
source’s magnitudes. The origin of the opposite trend
for Phot A and B is not clear, but we infer that this
is likely due to the sky estimation in individual frames,
where sources have much lower signal to noise ratio than
the stacked frames.

Third, the systematic errors at the bright end of the
magnitude range (F 814W (cid:46) 27 mag) are almost neg-
ligible in both the inner and outer regions. The er-
rors become larger at the faint end, but do not exceed
|∆F 814W | = 0.15 mag down to F 814W = 29 mag. The

reductions are indicated according to the legend. The left and right panels show the results from the inner (1(cid:48) < SM A ≤ 2(cid:48))
and outer regions (SM A > 2(cid:48)), respectively.

50% recovery rates are measured at F 814W ∼ 28.2 mag
in the inner region (see Figure 6). At this level, the
inner region gives systematic errors of ∼0.05 mag for
Phot A and B, and ∼0.03 mag for Phot C and D. The
same completeness level for the outer region is measured
at F 814W ∼ 28.6 mag, and there we found systematic
errors of ∼0.11 mag for Phot A and B, and ∼0.07 mag
for Phot C and D. It is noted that these systematic er-
rors are well within the statistical errors (0.2 ∼ 0.3 mag,
see Figure 7).

In summary, we detected measurable systematic errors
at the faint magnitude range of photometry. The sign
of the systematic eﬀects is not the same in all the cases.
The photometric accuracy is not much diﬀerent between
individual reductions, though we found slightly smaller
systematic errors for Phot C and D than Phot A and B
in the outer region.

3.4. Comparison of real stars

With the extensive artiﬁcial star data and their pho-
tometric properties in hand, we compared real-star pho-
tometry. Figure 10 displays the magnitude diﬀerence be-
tween individual reductions for the inner (left) and outer
(right) regions of NGC 3370. We used Phot D, which is
a stacked-frame DAOPHOT photometry with TinyTim
PSFs, as a reference reduction to see residual diﬀerences
(∆F 814W = Phot D – others). The red circles indicates
the observed median oﬀset in each magnitude bin. These
oﬀsets can be corrected for the systematic bias measured
from the artiﬁcial star experiments, as marked by green
circles.

The brightest stars exhibit a small scatter in ∆F 814W
so systematic oﬀsets can be easily identiﬁed. We found
that Phot A shows larger oﬀsets than Phot B and C in
both inner and outer regions, as listed in Table 5. The
median oﬀsets for stars brighter than F 814W = 26 mag
in Phot A are ∆F 814W = 0.050 and 0.051 mag for the
inner and outer regions, respectively. These values are
much larger than the oﬀsets from the other reductions:
∆F 814W = –0.015 and –0.008 mag (inner and outer re-
gions) for Phot B and –0.029 and –0.010 mag (inner and
outer regions) for Phot C. The larger oﬀsets for Phot A
are most likely due to the diﬀerent methodology adopted
for the aperture correction: Phot A uses the automated
routines implemented in DOLPHOT (ApCor=1) and the
other reductions are based on the manual determina-
tions with visual inspections of images (see Section 2.3).
According to the DOLPHOT manual, the default aper-
ture correction could have the potential for errors. We
infer that the DOLPHOT processing of the NGC 3370
ﬁeld (based on Phot A) results in a signiﬁcant error in
the aperture correction. This result supports the general
conclusion that a careful inspection of the aperture cor-
rection is an essential component of obtaining accurate
photometry.

Looking at the faintest stars, we found that Phot A
and B show clear magnitude-dependent oﬀsets. The ob-
served oﬀsets (red circles) decrease with increasing mag-
nitude and they reach ∆F 814W (cid:39) −0.15 mag in the
faintest magnitude bin. This is explained by the sys-
tematic bias of individual reductions. Through the ar-

diﬀerences between individual reductions are indicated as a function of Phot D magnitudes. Median oﬀsets in each magnitude
bin are marked by red dots. Green dots are the median oﬀsets corrected for the systematic bias measured from the artiﬁcial
star tests. The bias correction at the faintest level (F 814W ∼ 28.75 mag) is uncertain, so we marked the corrected oﬀset by
open circles.

tiﬁcial star experiments, we conﬁrmed that Phot A and
B have a negative systematic bias at the faint end (i.e.,
recovered magnitudes are fainter than the input mag-
nitudes), and the other two reductions (Phot C and D)
have an opposite trend (i.e., recovered magnitudes are
brighter than the input magnitudes). Therefore, a di-
rect photometry comparison of Phot D with Phot A and
B should show very apparent oﬀsets.

The observed oﬀsets in the photometry comparison
can be corrected using the measure of photometric bias,
as marked by green circles in Figure 10. It is clear that
the green circles show reduced magnitude dependent oﬀ-
sets, except for the last point at F 814W = 28.75 mag.
The larger oﬀset for the last point (open circle) is likely
due to the nature of the bias correction; the photomet-
ric bias is measured as a function of the input magni-
tudes (Figure 9), and the bias correction is applied to the
observed magnitudes (Figure 10). Therefore, the bias
correction is expected to work well when the degree of
the correction is not very signiﬁcant (∆F 814Wcorr (cid:46)
0.1 mag). Acknowledging this limitation, we found sta-
ble and approximately constant oﬀsets over the entire
magnitude range (Table 5).

It is also noted that Phot C shows measurable oﬀsets
in both the inner and outer regions of NGC 3370. Phot C
is fainter than Phot D. These two sets of photometry
were analyzed using almost the same processing method,
except for PSF images: empirical PSFs for Phot C and
Tiny Tim PSFs for Phot D. Therefore, the measurable
oﬀsets come entirely from the choice of PSF images.

3.5. Color-Magnitude Diagrams

Figure 11 presents color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs)
of resolved point sources in the inner (top) and outer
(bottom) regions of NGC 3370 taken from individual
reductions. We used signal-to-noise ratios returned
from DOLPHOT to mark an approximate boundary of
S/N = 3 in F 814W and S/N = 1 in F 555W , as shown
by a dashed line. Sources below this line are less reli-
able, as they have large (random and systematic) errors
with low recovery rates.

CMDs of the inner region show stellar populations
with distinct ages: young main sequence stars (a vertical
feature at F 555W − F 814W ≈ 0), red helium-burning
stars (a slanted feature reaching to F 814W = 24.5 mag
at F 555W − F 814W ≈ 2), old red giant branch (RGB)
stars (a feature below F 814W ≈ 28 mag containing the
largest number of stars), and asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars (a feature between F 814W ≈ 27 and
28 mag having the reddest color). These features are
seen in all four CMDs from individual reductions. We
note, however, that the presence of the old RGB pop-

ulation is more evident in Phot C and D than Phot A
and B. We infer that this is due to the diﬀerences in
photometric performance as follows: 1) Phot C and D
have higher (∼5%) recovery rates in the RGB magni-
tude range; 2) Phot C and D have smaller (20% ∼ 30%)
photometric errors, as marked by error bars in the ﬁgure;
and 3) Phot C and D have a positive systematic bias at
the faint side (i.e., brighter recovered magnitudes). For
Phot A and B, however, the recovered magnitudes are
fainter, so the features in CMDs are more elongated.

Photometry of the outer region is deeper and more
precise than the inner region, owing to its lower stel-
lar density (i.e., less crowding). Indeed, CMDs of the
outer region in Figure 11 exhibit a dominant old RGB
population in all four panels. Small photometric errors
for Phot C and D make them useful to investigate ﬁne
structures at the fainter magnitudes in the CMD, such
as the tip of the RGB.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The distance measurements of nearby galaxies have
improved signiﬁcantly in recent years. Given the great
importance of the local distance scale in the determina-
tion of cosmological parameters, a more stringent con-
trol of errors is to be desired. This paper has investi-
gated various systematic issues associated with the data
reduction methods, together with presenting a quanti-
tative comparison of photometric performance.

We selected deep observations for NGC 3370 taken
with ACS/WFC on board HST (Figure 1). The ACS
data were reduced using four methods divided into two
groups: DOLPHOT runs on individual frames (Phot A
and B) and DAOPHOT runs on stacked frames (Phot C
and D) (Table 1). These reductions include diﬀerent
aperture correction methods (automatic vs. manual)
and PSF models (synthetic vs. empirical). Photometric
performance (recovery rates, statistical and systematic
errors) of individual reduction methods have been eval-
uated using artiﬁcial star tests.

We have found that photometric incompleteness is
comparable in all four reductions (Figure 6). The sys-
tematic diﬀerence is smaller than 10% in recovery rates
and it does not change the general shape of the com-
pleteness curves. The overall agreement indicates that
the DOLPHOT processing does a good job of detecting
faint sources, comparable with the stacked frame pho-
tometry with DAOPHOT.

Photometric precision is measured to be 20% – 30%
higher for Phot C and D (DAOPHOT runs on stacked
frames) than Phot A and B (DOLPHOT runs on indi-
vidual frames). Such a trend is seen in both inner and
outer regions of NGC 3370 (Figure 7). We also found

CMDs of resolved point sources in the inner (top) and outer (bottom) regions of NGC 3370. The results of
individual reductions are shown in each panel. Photometric errors at (F 555W − F 814W ) ∼ 1.3 determined from the artiﬁcial
star experiments are marked at (F 555W − F 814W ) = −0.5. Dashed lines in the left two panels indicate approximate limiting
magnitudes with signal-to-noise ratios of 3 in F 814W and 1 in F 555W .

that statistical errors assigned to each detection by the
photometry codes are signiﬁcantly smaller than the er-
rors estimated from the artiﬁcial star tests (Figure 8).
Therefore, artiﬁcial star tests are crucial to properly es-
timate errors of photometry and their impact on the
error budget for subsequent measurements, such as stel-
lar distances and cosmological parameters based upon
them (e.g., a local value of H0).

Photometric bias is also detected (Figure 9). The
bias is almost negligible in the bright magnitude range
(F 814W (cid:46) 27 mag) but becomes larger at fainter mag-
nitudes, making the recovered magnitudes brighter (for
Phot C and D) or fainter (for Phot A and B).

Due to the photometric bias, a direct comparison of
real stars shows large magnitude dependent oﬀsets (Fig-
ure 10). These oﬀsets are reduced after applying the bias
correction. Small, but non-negligible systematic oﬀsets

(0.01 ∼ 0.03 mag) are detected in comparisons between
Phot B, C, and D. This implies that there could be
reduction-dependent uncertainties remaining after the
cited photometric bias correction has been applied. Sim-
ilar results can be found in Jang et al. (2021). They
presented photometry of the NGC 4258 halo ﬁeld with
a number of sky ﬁtting options (Fitsky = 1, 2, and
3) and PSF models (TinyTim and Anderson’s PSFs)
available in DOLPHOT. A direct photometry compar-
ison showed oﬀsets of ∼0.02 mag at the faint side and
they too were not entirely eliminated with their bias cor-
rection (see their Figures 8 and 9 and A1). Studies of
NGC 3370 and NGC 4258 showed that the reduction
dependent uncertainties can be reduced to a 0.02 mag,
corresponding to 1% of the luminosity distance. We ex-
pect that a systematic survey of nearby galaxies will de-
liver a more robust estimate of the reduction-dependent

16

uncertainties in the stellar distance scale and the mea-
surement of the Hubble constant.

The automatic aperture correction option (ApCor=1)
in DOLPHOT has also been tested. This option is
widely used in DOLPHOT processing, but appears to
be subject to larger errors, as documented in the man-
ual. We have found that there is a large discrep-
ancy (∼0.05 mag) between the automatic and manual
aperture corrections (Figure 10), indicating that the au-
tomatic correction routines applied to the NGC 3370
dataset introduces a sizable systematic error. Therefore,
the automatic correction option should be used with care
and a manual examination is necessary to achieve high
accuracy photometry in the DOLPHOT processing.

CMDs of independent reductions are comparable in
showing distinct stellar populations in NGC 3370 (Fig-
ure 11). One noticeable diﬀerence is that Phot C and D
CMDs provide a noticeably clearer delineation of the old
RGB population in both the inner and outer regions.
This implies that the stacked frame photometry is help-
ful for studying non-variable stars in external galaxies.
