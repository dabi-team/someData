I. INTRODUCTION 

The  ageing  of  the  population  and  rise  in  chronic  health 
conditions  have  had  significant  economic  and  social 
implications for public sectors, family and individuals. This has 
precipitated  a  shift  towards  understanding  daily  activities  and 
well-being at home in order to make lifestyle changes to manage 
and even prevent chronic health conditions. An Internet of Thing 
(IoT) approach to monitoring people’s daily living activities for 
the purposes of early diagnosis, monitoring chronic disease, and 
making  informed  lifestyle  changes  is  proposed  in  [1].  The 
SPHERE project aims to collect data on the home environment 
and residents’ activities via a wireless sensor network. Activity 
data  will  be  collected  through  wearable  accelerometers  and 
video  system,  with  a  focus  on body  pose,  motion  and activity 
intensity  that  may  be  linked  with  various  health  conditions. 
However, there are concerns that the wearable device may not 
always be worn by the users and the video system will not cover 
certain areas such as bedrooms and bathrooms due to the privacy 
issues. Thus, a Wi-Fi-based passive motion sensing concept is 
proposed  in  this  paper,  with  a  view  to  underpinning  a  non-
intrusive and full coverage in-home healthcare IoT platform.  

Passive  wireless  sensing  (PWS)  has  evolved  from  passive 
radar,  which  leverages  wireless  signals  for  non-cooperative 
detection.  Research  has  focused  on  using  a  wide  range  of 
transmission sources including GSM, FM, WiMax [2] and Wi-
Fi  [3],  to  detect  targets  such  as  aircrafts,  ships,  vehicles  and 
humans.  The  use  of  802.11  signal  as  an  illuminator  for  target 
discovery has been reported in [4] for outdoor vehicle tracking, 
and  [3]  for  indoor  through-wall  human  discovery.  Subsequent 
works on 802.11-based passive radar are further extended to real 

time  [5]  and  small  human  body  movement  [6]  detection 
capability.  Most  passive  or  active  small  movement  detection 
systems use micro Doppler as the main metric. The detection and 
utilization of micro Doppler has been reported in [7] by using 
ultrasound,  and  [8]  by  using  800  MHz  bandwidth  microwave 
signal. To use of 2.4 GHz ISM band wireless signal for human 
movement and motion capture is also reported in [9, 10]. In [9], 
a  Doppler  shifting  extracting  method  for  OFDM  signal  is 
described  and  verified  with  specially  generated  OFDM  signal 
source.  In  order  to  achieve  the  Doppler  shift  resolution,  the 
reflected  OFDM  symbols  are  demodulated  and  decoded  by 
following standard 802.11 protocol, then equalized with the first 
received  OFDM  symbol.  To  implement  the  method,  the 
hardware  or  software  decoding  module  is  inevitable,  and 
potentially  adds  to  the  complexity  of  the  system.  From  the 
results shown in [9], there are still strong zero Doppler residue 
that probably comes from direct signal leak, which is common 
in  passive  detection  applications.  In  [10],  an  angle  estimation 
method  is  described  to  detect  human  movement  in  indoor 
scenarios with specially generated OFDM signals on 2.4G ISM 
band. The performance of this method may be difficult to predict 
when  using  commercial  off-the-shelf  (COTS)  Wi-Fi  devices, 
which  transmit  variable  temporal  bursts  with  random  interval. 
To  achieve  more  detailed  human  activity  information,  the 
authors of [10] demonstrated a tracking function with 1.65 GHz 
ultra-wideband  signal  FMCW  chirp  on  6  o  7  GHz  carrier 
frequency in [11]. In [12], the same authors extend the detection 
ability  from  tracking  to  respiration  with  specific  layout  of  the 
active ultra-wideband FMCW angle detection system.  

This paper proposes a real time 802.11 signal based passive 
human movement capturing system, which uses Doppler as the 
main  metric.  The  method  used  for  Doppler  extraction  in  this 
work is cross ambiguity function (CAF). Due to the low range 
resolution of 802.11 signals, the echo delay in CAF is ignored in 
this work. Leveraging fast CAF processing, the proposed system 
gains  the  capability  of  sensing  very  small  and  slow  human 
movements by taking longer integration duration. In addition, it 
is easy to add pre and post processing, for example, normalized 
least  mean  square  (NLMS)  filter  or  CLEAN  algorithm  to 
mitigate  the  direct  signal  interference  (DSI)  to  improve  the 
detection  performance.  The  concept  is  verified  with  software 
defined  radio  (SDR)  in  different  scenarios,  which  include 
through-wall  human  body  motion  sensing by  using  the  COTS 
Wi-Fi  AP,  hand  movement  and  hand tremor  sensing by  using 

 
 
laptop Wi-Fi signal leak, and even respiration by using 2.4 GHz 
ISM band CW signal which can be easily transplanted to Wi-Fi 
signal. 

Comparing with works in [9, 10, 11, 12], the proposed Wi-
following 

technology  presents 

the 

Fi  passive  sensing 
advantages: 

  The proposed signal processing is a general method that 
can be applied for all the possible signals, so, the system 
will not be constrained by OFDM modulated signal as 
used in [9] and [10]. 

  The  proposed  system  uses  passive  detection  approach 
which means that it takes the ubiquitous existing signals 
in  the  space  to  achieve  diverse  motion  detection 
abilities.  The  requirement  of  the  high-spec  ultra-
wideband signal as used in [11] and [12] is not required. 
In  this  paper,  mostly  a  non-cooperative  11  MHz 
bandwidth Wi-Fi signal is used to verify the concept in 
this paper.  

  The  proposed  method  for  detecting  different  types  of 
movements  is  a  signal  processing  method.  In  other 
words,  it  is  a  software  behaviour.  By  swapping  the 
software  parameters  set,  different  motions  can  be 
detected.  The  hardware  embodiment  can  be  modified 
according to the requirements of each practical scenario. 
  The proposed method has been verified with temporal 
bursts from COTS 802.11 AP. Other works, such as [9] 
and [10], used the controllable self-generated signals for 
experiments  while  the  performance  may  deteriorate  if 
moved to the practical random burst situation. 

The rest part of this paper is organized as follows: the next 
section  describes  the  principle  of  signal  processing  and  main 
technology innovations of the PWS system. Section III presents 
the  application  scenarios,  and  the  corresponding  experimental 
results  are  shown  and  analysed.  Conclusions,  potential 
applications, extended functions and future work are given in the 
last section. 

II. PASSIVE WIRELESS SENSING 

A. Passive Wireless Sensing System 

Passive  sensing  leverages  existing  transmissions  to  detect 
and monitor non-cooperative targets. The illuminator could be, 
for  example,  an  FM  mobile  base  station,  or  a  DVB  or  DAB 
transmitter. In this paper, the illuminator is a wireless network 
transmitter  based  on  the  IEEE  standard  802.11,  commonly 
referred  as  Wi-Fi.  Such  transmitters  are  widely  deployed  in 
residential  and  care  homes,  and  are  thus  ideal  for  healthcare 
applications.  In  order  to  sense  the  target,  a  passive  sensing 
system is equipped with two antennas. One is used for obtaining 
the signal directly from the illuminator, while the other is used 
for  capturing  the  reflected  signal  from  the  target.  The  signals 
from  two  antennas  are  called  the  reference  signal  and 
surveillance signal, respectively. The two signals are correlated 
and processed using the CAF in equation (1). 

𝐶𝐴𝐹(𝜏𝑑, 𝑓𝑑) = ∑ 𝑟[𝑛]𝑠∗[𝑛 + 𝜏𝑑]𝑒−𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑑

𝑁

𝑛=0

𝑛
𝑁

        (1) 

where N is the total number of samples, n means the n-th sample, 
𝑟[𝑛]  and  𝑠[𝑛]  are  discrete-time  reference  and  surveillance 
signals in complex form, operator * is the complex conjugate of 
the signal, 𝜏𝑑 is the time delay which can be converted to range 
information, and  𝑓𝑑 is the frequency shift. Using equation (1), it 
is easy to identify the relative range and velocity of the target in 
relation  to  the  illuminating  transmitter.  Relative  range  is 
indicated by the time delay 𝜏𝑑 of the surveillance signal. Relative 
velocity is indicated by the frequency shift 𝑓𝑑 of frequency shift. 
When there is some finite movement of the target, a clear signal 
should be present for the corresponding values of 𝜏𝑑 and 𝑓𝑑 on 
the CAF surface. 

Parameters 𝜏𝑑 and 𝑓𝑑 in equation (1) quantify the effective 
range and frequency resolution of the passive radar systems in 
[13]. In the case of passive Wi-Fi radar, the range resolution is 
limited by the bandwidth of the 802.11 signal, which results in 
10 to 15 meter range resolution. This is not accurate enough for 
most indoor applications apart from simple motion sensing. The 
frequency  resolution  in  equation  (1)  is  determined  by  the 
integration time, which is equivalent to the number of samples 
in the discrete system. Compared with the signal bandwidth, the 
number  of  samples  is  a  controllable  parameter  in  the  PWS 
system. By increasing the number of samples taken in equation 
(1), the system sensitivity to velocity can be improved to a high 
level.  Some  very  small  and  slow  movements  can  therefore be 
captured  with  the  system.  The  main  drawback  of  the  long 
integration time is the increase in processing time of the data. 
This  problem  has  been  resolved  with  by  the  CAF  calculation 
methods introduced in this paper. This will be described in this 
section,  along  with  the  interference  cancellation  and  pipeline 
processing flow design.  

A basic passive wireless system has three main components: 
antennas  for  detecting  the  reference  and  surveillance  channel 
signals, ADC module for each channel and a computing unit for 
signal processing. The  specification of each component  varies 
according  to  the  application  scenario.  The  antenna  can  range 
from  high  gain, directional dish  types  to a  miniature  low  gain 
patch.  The  ADC  module  could  be,  for  example,  a  general 
purpose USRP module or use a dedicated ADC front end for 2.4 
GHz signals. The computing unit could be a PC, an embedded 
system, or DSP chips. The demonstration PWS system used in 
this paper is described in section IV. 

B. Real Time Signal processing 

As mentioned in the previous subsection, longer integration 
times lead to higher Doppler sensitivity, while resulting in longer 
processing times and increased computing load. This makes it 
very difficult to carry out real time processing without avoiding 
information drop out, if simply using the calculation method in 
equation  (1).  In  order  to  enable  the  real  time  sensing  that  is 
required  in  most  healthcare  scenarios,  three  techniques  are 
implemented  in  the  PWS  system:  pipeline  processing,  down 
sampling and batch processing.  
Pipeline:  Pipeline  processing  is  an  extension  of  parallel  code 
execution that enables performance gains with serial multistage 
algorithms on multicore machines. A sequential code sequence 
is partitioned into sub-procedures, which are each allocated to a 

separate  core.  The  algorithm  can  then  run  simultaneously  on 
multiple sets of recorded data, or data that streams continuously. 
To  maximize  throughput,  each  subroutine  should  be  carefully 
balanced to ensure approximately equal processing times. The 
delay of a pipelined system can be written as (2): 

𝜏𝑝 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥 {𝜏𝑖}                                 (2) 
where 𝜏𝑖 is the delay of i-th sub-procedure. In the PWS system, 
the  sub-procedures  are:  signal  sampling,  CAF  processing, 
interference cancellation, which are shown in Fig. 1. 

Fig. 1. Pipeline processing architecture in wireless passive radar 

Down sampling: As previously mentioned, range resolution is 
not an issue in the Doppler sensing mode used in the healthcare 
context.  The sampling rate can therefore be reduced in order to 
achieve higher Doppler sensitivity by taking longer integration 
time with the same number of samples. The aim of the PWS is 
not to decode the information, thus the down sampling will not 
impact the Doppler detection.  
Batch Processing: Batch processing is a concept taken from IT 
systems, which is used for executing a series of non-interactive 
tasks.  In  PWS  context,  the  pending  samples  are  divided  into 
segments  and  then  only  the  beginning  of  the  each  segment  is 
taken for processing. The processing principle can be found in 
[14]. The processing flow of batch processing is shown in Fig. 
2.  

𝐽 = 2 ∙ ⌈

determined by the predicted maximum target velocity 𝑣𝑚𝑎𝑥. The 
relationship can be described by the following equation: 
𝑣𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑐

∙ 𝑓0 ∙ 𝜏𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒⌉                           (3) 
where  operator  ⌈𝑥⌉  denotes  rounding  the  elements  of  x  to  the 
nearest integers towards infinity, 𝑐 is the propagation velocity of 
the wireless signal, and 𝑓0 is the centre frequency. The factor 2 
is  used  for  reserving  𝑣𝑚𝑎𝑥  for  both  forward  and  backward 
directions. 

interference  suppression  and 

Besides  the  above  processing,  other  processing  techniques 
such as CLEAN [4] and  CFAR [15] are also applied after the 
target 
CAF  processing  for 
detection.  The CLEAN algorithm is applied here to cancel the 
interference from direct signal (DSI) and the reflections from the 
stationary  objects,  by  subtracting  a  scaled  reference  surface 
which is constructed by reference signal. The scaling factor is 
updated  in  each  iteration  [4].  CFAR  is  widely  used  in  radar 
detection systems for detecting the target by setting a threshold 
of the index which can be derived from different criteria; this is 
beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper.  The  criterion  in  this  paper  is 
called cell average [15]. 

III. EXPERIMENT SCENARIOS AND RESULTS 

In  this  section,  results  from  three  different  indoor  sensing 
scenarios  are  presented  to  demonstrate  the  how  the  signal 
processing described in the previous section is applied in a real 
environment.  The  application  scenarios  include:  through-wall 
body  gesture  detection,  hand  gesture/tremor  sensing,  and 
breathing  detection.  The  experimental  setup  and  detection 
results are also provided. The PWS system used in the following 
experiments  is  a  SDR  based  system  using  USRP  modules.  A 
schematic of this system is shown in Fig. 3. In this system two 
synchronized Ettus USRP N210s are used for downconverting 
the RF signal and digitizing. The laptop is equipped with an Intel 
Core  i7  3.2  GHz  CPU.  The  sampled  data  is  imported  to  the 
laptop  via  Ethernet  ports.  The  operating  system  provides 
multiple thread options for implementing pipeline processing in 
a Labview software.

Fig. 2. Batch processing flowchart 

The recorded synchronized reference signal and surveillance 
signal are divided into 𝑣 isometric data segments respectively. 
For each segment, only a certain portion of the sampled data are 
taken  and  used  for  the  follow-up  processing.    Experimental 
results show that a 10% portion of the signal is sufficient to build 
a  clear  ambiguity  surface.  The  number  of  segments  𝐽  is 

A. Through-Wall Body Gesture Detection 
In this scenario, the main aim is to detect human body movement 
through-wall  or  non  through-wall  for  in-home  healthcare 
applications. In this section the SDR based system (Fig. 3) is set 
up for human body gesture detection through a 22cm brick wall 
in Fig. 4. The Wi-Fi AP used in this experiment is an Edimax 
M3000,  which  has  15  dBm  power  emissions.  One  high  gain 
antenna points to the AP as the reference channel, and the other

antenna is directed to the target as the surveillance channel. Four 
different  body  gesture  examples  and  corresponding  Doppler 
records are shown in Fig. 5. 

B. Hand movement and Tremor Detection 

Another potential healthcare application for the system is in 
the detection of small movements such as hand tremors. In this 
case,  the  system  takes  advantage  of  the  embedded  Wi-Fi 
emission  from  mobile  devices,  such  as  laptops  and  tablets,  to 
form the wireless passive radar.  The setup for this experiment is 
shown in Fig 6.  

Fig. 4. The experimental setup for through-wall human body gesture detection 

Fig. 6. Layout of the hand movement detection experiment on a laptop. Left: 
the hand-free setup, Right: attached solution. 

Very  small  PCB  antennas  are  used  for  receiving  the 
reference and surveillance signal. The surveillance antenna can 
be fixed in position on the laptop, or attached to the hand for fine 
movement measurements. Fig. 7 shows results for four different 
movements with the PCB antenna mounted on the laptop.  Fig. 
8 shows detection of very small tremors with the PCB antenna 
attached to the hand. These tremors are typical of those found in 
neurological disease such as Parkinson’s. 

Fig. 5. Human body movement detection results: (a) stooping-back, (b) 
squating-standing, (c) left-right body swing, (d) forward-backward swing. A 
4 seconds Doppler record is shown for each guesture cycle. The dynamic 
Doppler shift range of the body gesture is around ±10 Hz 

From the experiment results, we can see that different body 
gestures cause distinctive Doppler records. So, in-home human 
activities  could  be  recognized  using  a  template  library  and 
suitable classifiers. The recognized information is valuable for 
diverse  health-related  applications.  For  example,  in  [16]  the 
authors  have  clearly  identified  links  between  the  intensity  of 
daily  activity  and  certain  psychological  conditions.  Also,  the 
detection of specific activities can be used for alerting carers to 
emergency  situations  such  as  falling  or  lack  of  movement  for 
long periods.

(b), left to right movement, (c), counterclockwise movement, (d), clockwise 
movement. 4 second Doppler record is shown for each gesture 

        In Fig.7 and Fig. 8, 4 seconds Doppler records are shown 
to demonstrate the capability of the system for hand motion and 
hand  tremor  detection.  Fig.7  shows  distinguishable  Doppler 
pattern for each hand motion. In Fig. 8, the fast tremor causes 
the  higher  frequency  jitter,  which  is  about  4~6  Hz,  and  the

slower tremor causes the lower frequency jitter, which is around 
2~3 Hz.  The  measured  tremor  frequency  could be of  value  to 
clinicians  to  distinguish  tremor  due  to  different  neurological 
conditions.  A  wearable  or  device  free  system  could  also  be 
implemented enabling collection of tremor data over extended 
periods. This would be very valuable for monitoring the long-
term evolution of the condition.

frequency, (b) combined hand movement and tremor at higher frequency, (c) 
pure hand tremor with lower tremor frequency, (d) combined hand movement 
and tremor at lower frequency.  

C. Breathing Detection 

Another  important  application  of  this  technology  is  for 
detecting signs of life. In this section, an experiment is described 
that  uses  the PWS principle to detect bio-activity,  specifically 
chest  wall  movement  associated  with  breathing.  The  antennas 
and layout of the experiment is similar to that shown in Fig. 4, 
without the intervening wall. In this preliminary experiment, the 

Fig. 9. Detection result for human breathing using a 2.4 GHz CW transmission 

Wi-Fi  illuminator  is  replaced  by  a  2.4GHz  Continuous-wave 
(CW) signal source with an output power 10 dBm lower than the 
Edimax 3000 Wi-Fi AP used in the previous experiment. The 
experimental data is processed offline with Matlab. 

In contrast to the post interference cancellation method used 
in the previous scenarios, pre interference cancellation is applied 
to mitigate the direct signal leakage from the signal source. The 
pre  interference  cancellation  method  used  in  this  case  is  the 
NLMS.  Fig.  9  shows  results  from  a  human  subject,  recording 
about  7  respirations  over  about  25  seconds.  On  the  Doppler 
record surface generated with the filtered surveillance signal, the 
positive and negative Doppler shifts caused by the chest rising 
and  falling  movements  can  clearly  be  seen.  The  breathing 
frequency detected is close to the typical adult human respiration 
rate  of  12~15  per  minute.  This  method  used  for  the  CW 
transmitter can be extended to down sampled bandwidth Wi-Fi 
signals by properly adjusting the step size in the NLMS filter for 
the  breathing  movements.  This  preliminary  demonstration  of 
passive  breathing  detection  shows  that  the  PWS  could  be  a 
valuable  tool  in  monitoring  signs  of  life  in  hospitals  or 
residential homes. 

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 

This paper described the signal processing  method, system 
combination  and  experiment  scenarios.  The  experimental 
results  show  that  Wi-Fi  based  passive  sensing  technology  is 
suitable for non-intrusive data collection of human movement 
and  activities,  ranging  from  gross  body  movements  to  small 
hand  tremors.  It  is  envisaged  that  this  technology  can  be 
implemented in various scenarios and for diverse purposes. 

Wi-Fi APs are widespread in residential area, thus providing 
ample  opportunities  for  PWS  applications.  The  through-wall 
detection  ability  of  this  technology  lends  itself  to  broad 
application  scenarios  especially 
in-home  healthcare,  for 
example  to  unobtrusively  detect  falls,  abnormal  events,  and 
daily activities. This paper details the use of PWS to detect hand 
tremor and respiration, which have the potential to be used to 
further  understand  a  range  of  health  conditions  as  well  as  to 
detect extreme events. This technology also has the potential to 
enable alternative forms of interaction  within the smart home 
such as using movement to control settings or using breathing 
rates to respond to  mood,  without the  need for dedicated and 
sometimes intrusive devices.  

Although  the  technology  is  still  in  its  infancy,  it  has  the 
potential  to  be  further  developed  according  to  different 
directions.  The  first  direction  is  to  applying  machine  learning 
technology  to  interpret  the  premier  Doppler  detection  results. 
Using  machine  learning  methods,  more detailed  instantaneous 
human body and gesture information can be sensed, while the 
long  term  passive  sensing  data  can  be  used  to  understand  the 
relation between daily routines and health conditions. Secondly, 
it  can  be  integrated  with  data  from  different  types  of  sensors 
within  the  IoT.  As  there  are  also  video,  accelerometers  and 
environmental  sensors  on  the  SPHERE  platform  [1],  fusing 
these data with passively detected Doppler information will add 
a  new  dimension  to  discovering  unique  features  of  daily 
movements.  Lastly,  the  signal  processing  of  passive  sensing 

timeDopplertimeDopplertimeDopplertimeDoppler(a)(b)(c)(d) 
 
 
technology  is  far  from  completion;  there  is  still  large  area  to 
explore  new  signal  processing  methods  and  functions.  For 
example, by synthesising the Doppler detections from different 
locations, high accuracy target moving trace can be calculated 
with  proper  tracking  filter  calibration.  High  accuracy  location 
information is a key requirement in many IoT applications. The 
idea has been tested and summarized in our recent paper [17], 
which constrains the localisation error down to half meter for the 
indoor scenario.
