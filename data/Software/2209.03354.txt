Abstract

Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomog-
raphy angiography (OCTA) are promising tools for the (early) diagnosis of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). These non-invasive imaging techniques are cost-
eﬀective and more accessible than alternative neuroimaging tools. However,
interpreting and classifying multi-slice scans produced by OCT devices is
time-consuming and challenging even for trained practitioners.
There are surveys on machine learning and deep learning approaches con-
cerning the automated analysis of OCT scans for various diseases such as
glaucoma. However, the current literature lacks an extensive survey on
the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or cognitive impairment using OCT or
OCTA. This has motivated us to do a comprehensive survey aimed at ma-
chine/deep learning scientists or practitioners who require an introduction
to the problem. The paper contains 1) an introduction to the medical back-
ground of Alzheimer’s Disease and Cognitive Impairment and their diagnosis
using OCT and OCTA imaging modalities, 2) a review of various technical
proposals for the problem and the sub-problems from an automated analysis
perspective, 3) a systematic review of the recent deep learning studies and
available OCT/OCTA datasets directly aimed at the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
Disease and Cognitive Impairment. For the latter, we used Publish or Perish
Software to search for the relevant studies from various sources such as Sco-
pus, PubMed, and Web of Science. We followed the PRISMA approach to
screen an initial pool of 3073 references and determined ten relevant studies
(N=10, out of 3073) that directly targeted AD diagnosis. We identiﬁed the

1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It is
an irreversible, progressive brain disorder usually marked by a decline in
cognitive functioning with no known treatment.
It is characterized by a
massive decrease in brain size (neurodegeneration) caused by the neurons’
accumulation of proteins (amyloid-beta and tau). Since the retina and the
brain grow from the same neural tube, eyes are considered extensions of
the brain. Postmortem studies in AD also highlighted the accumulation of
amyloid-beta and tau proteins in the retina. More recently, high-resolution
visual imaging techniques, including optical coherence tomography (OCT)
and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), have been proposed
to evaluate structural and vascular changes in the retina of AD patients.

OCT and OCTA generate large-scale, high-dimensional and multimodal
retinal scans, which require tedious and time-consuming readings to be per-
formed by experts. As in similar medical diagnostic ﬁelds, machine or deep
learning-based automated approaches can signiﬁcantly enhance physicians’
ability to eﬃciently diagnose abnormalities in the retina.

There are surveys studying the deep learning-based analysis of eye dis-
eases such as glaucoma (Mirzania et al., 2021). Bourkhime et al. (2022) re-
cently reviewed machine learning (ML) and novel ophthalmologic biomarkers
for AD screening in a brief study. They have identiﬁed 13 studies. How-
ever, the literature lacks a broader survey on using deep learning (DL) for
Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis from OCT and OCTA. This has motivated the
current comprehensive survey aimed at machine/deep learning scientists or
practitioners who require an introduction to the problem.

In this work, we present 1) an introduction to the medical background of
Alzheimer’s Disease and Cognitive Impairment and their traces that can be
observed through OCT and OCTA imaging, 2) a review of various technical
proposals for the problem and the sub-problems from an automated analysis

perspective, 3) a systematic review of the recent deep learning studies and
available OCT/OCTA datasets directly aimed at the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
Disease and Cognitive Impairment. We discuss the progress in the ﬁeld
and future directions in light of existing studies and recent data collection
initiatives.

One of the main goals of this study is to compile a useful survey that
can serve as an introduction to the problem. The organization of the paper
is geared towards this goal. The related work is divided into two parts
to explain the medical and technical background of the problem. Section
2 explains various biomarkers that were identiﬁed by medical researchers
to screen, diagnose, or classify AD from OCT and OCTA scans. Figure
1 summarizes the medical background and highlights our survey’s focus of
interest. The machine or deep learning approaches or applications to analyze
OCT/OCTA scans are examined in Section 3. The guidelines of the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) (Page
et al., 2021) are followed in this study, as explained in Section 4. The results
of the systematic search can be found in Section 4.1. Collecting suﬃcient,
high-quality and uniformly annotated data to build high-accuracy models
is diﬃcult. Section 4.2 explains the issues about collecting AD-related OCT
data and currently available datasets for the research. Finally, our discussion
and conclusions can be found in Sections 5 and 6.

2. Medical Background

World Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁes dementia as the seventh
leading cause of death among older people globally and recognizes it as a
public health priority (WHO, 2019). WHO deﬁnes dementia as follows:

Dementia is a syndrome due to disease of the brain, usually of a chronic
or progressive nature, in which there is disturbance of multiple higher cortical
functions, including memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calcula-
tion, learning capacity, language, and judgment (WHO, 2014)

Dementia is not a single disease (Dening and Sandilyan, 2015); it is a
general term –like heart disease– that covers a wide range of speciﬁc medical
conditions (see Figure 1).

2.1. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and one
of the top ten leading causes of death in the world. The slow progress of

Common medical ﬁndings related to AD are listed under the OCT/OCTA boxes.

the disease begins almost 20 years before the symptoms arise (Gaugler et al.,
2022). Accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau proteins in the neurons (Den-
ing and Sandilyan, 2015) causes degenerative changes and mass decrease
in the brain, especially in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and ventricles
(Habib Havoutis, 2017; Mu et al., 1999; Juottonen et al., 1999) (Figure 2).

AD ﬁrst starts in the hippocampus region of the brain, which is responsi-
ble for forming new memories. The patients begin to have diﬃculties creating
new memories (Gaugler et al., 2022). They may function independently even
though the symptoms can be noticed by their families, close friends, and
doctors. This phase is generally called Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),
representing the preclinical stage of AD. Although the clinical diagnosis of
MCI is not a necessary precursor to AD, it serves as a risk factor for AD
progression (Habib Havoutis, 2017). Therefore, diﬀerentiating stable MCI
(sMCI) from progressive, prodromal MCI (pMCI) is important, and it has
been the focus of various studies (Ellendt et al., 2017; Yamanakkanavar et al.,
2020).

After the hippocampus, the cerebral cortex responsible for language and
information processing begins to thin as the brain gradually shrinks. The
patient starts to have diﬃculty in thinking and planning. Older memories are
lost. As more and more neurons die, ventricles ﬁlled with cerebrospinal ﬂuid
grow larger. This stage is called Alzheimer’s disease (Moderate), typically

5

the longest stage that can last many years. As the disease progresses, the
person with AD will require greater care (Gaugler et al., 2022).

In the ﬁnal stage of the disease (Severe), dementia symptoms are severe.
As memory and cognitive skills continue to worsen, signiﬁcant personality
changes may occur, and individuals need extensive care (Gaugler et al., 2022).

2.2. Diagnosis of AD and MCI

Medical history is the ﬁrst step and very critical for any clinical diag-
nosis. Therefore, a detailed history such as family medical history, existing
or past medical issues, current health parameters, and cognitive status must
be obtained from the patient or the caregiver. This step is vital for un-
derstanding the progress of the disease as well. Ruling out other sources
of dementia is equally important (Habib Havoutis, 2017; McKhann et al.,
2011). Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a small and simple test that

used and globally accepted cognitive test (Folstein et al., 1975).
It has
ﬁve parts: orientation, registration, attention, recall, and language. Other
tests such as Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive sub-scale
(ADAS–Cog), Wechsler Memory Scale, the General Practitioner Assessment
of Cognition (GPCOG), Mini-Cog, the Memory Impairment Screen (MIS),
the Clock Drawing Test (CDT), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA) (Habib Havoutis, 2017) can be used independently or in combina-
tion with MMSE.

If any form of dementia is suspected, further diagnostic tests follow the
clinical examination. Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalog-
raphy (MEG) are two non-invasive methods used in diagnosing cognitive
impairment. EEG measures the brain’s electrical activity using electrodes
In contrast, MEG measures the magnetic

ﬁelds generated by the electrical activity using superconductive quantum
interference devices placed over the head (Budson and Kowall, 2011). EEG
and MEG signals can detect neurodegeneration-induced alterations in synap-
tic and neural activity. Therefore, these tools provide valuable information
about the changes in brain dynamics due to AD (Al-Nuaimi et al., 2021).

Standard skull X-ray examination is ineﬀective in displaying AD-related
changes in soft brain tissues. Computed tomography (CT) and ordinary
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more capable than X-ray, albeit with
various limitations in diagnosing AD. For example, although CT eﬀectively
detects advanced stages of AD, it usually shows no abnormal ﬁndings in the

6

early stages. Standard head MRI displays soft tissues (grey matter and white
matter) in detail. The brain’s size and volume can easily be used to diﬀeren-
tiate AD patients from health cohorts (HC). However, MRI does not reveal
many AD-related physiological and ﬂuid biomarker changes. Therefore, the
speciﬁcity and sensitivity of MCI vs. HC diagnosis using head MRI are not
as high as needed (Zeng et al., 2021; Yamanakkanavar et al., 2020). Modern
neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission computed tomography
(PET) and functional MRI (fMRI) are more accurate but more expensive al-
ternatives for early AD (MCI) diagnosis. PET is an invasive nuclear medicine
imaging technique that helps visualize the cerebral blood ﬂow and functional

network function by detecting changes caused by blood ﬂow. fMRI is mainly
used in clinical trials of AD (Zeng et al., 2021).

Aβ plaques, tau proteins, senile plaques (SP), and neuroﬁbrillary tangles
(NFTs) are the causes of cell death and dementia according to the amy-
loid cascade hypothesis (Armstrong, 2011). Therefore, these are the most
common biomarkers used to diagnose AD in clinical trials. These biomark-
ers can be found in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) or blood. Results obtained
from biomarker-rich CSF give more accurate values than the peripheral blood
(Nguyen et al., 2020).

Electrophysiologic methods, neurological imaging, and biomarkers sup-
port the ﬁnal decision. Recently, there has been increased interest in retinal
examination as a promising candidate for early AD diagnosis.

During embryonic development, the retina and the optic nerve grow from
the neural tube and are thus considered as parts or extensions of the central
nervous system (Blazes and Lee). Figure 3 shows the neural layers of the
retina. The only light-sensitive cells in the retina are the photoreceptors.
When the light falls on the photoreceptors, the signal is carried from bipolar
cells to ganglion cells that ﬁre action potentials in response to the light. All
other cells are inﬂuenced by light via direct and indirect synaptic interactions.
These impulses propagate down the optic nerve to the rest of the brain. The
only output source from the retina is the ganglion cells (Bear et al., 2016).

The eye is the only organ in which we can see the cardiovascular blood
vessels and an inner blood-retinal barrier (a tight protective layer of cells
and capillaries that prevent larger molecules from entering the retina) sim-
ilar to the blood-brain barrier (London et al., 2013). Consequently, reti-
nal images are also used to analyze systemic diseases such as cardiovascular
disease (Wagner et al., 2020). Since the eye is more accessible than the

brain, techniques used to examine the eye are more practical, generally non-
or less invasive and more cost-eﬀective than the brain imaging alternatives
(MRI, PET, CT) (Song et al., 2021; Cunha et al., 2022). The neurodegener-
ative process that impacts the brain neurons also aﬀects the retinal neurons.
Speciﬁcally, postmortem AD studies highlighted the accumulation of Aβ and
NFTs in the retinal and optic nerve tissue. Moreover, animal (Hadoux et al.,
2019; Carelli et al., 2017; Gardner et al., 2020) and human studies (den Haan
et al., 2018) conclusively reveal the retinal Aβ accumulations. This raises the
question: Can ophthalmological assessments detect Alzheimer’s disease and
related disorders?

Ophthalmologists commonly use multiple modalities for the assessment of
neurodegenerative diseases. These can be grouped into three main categories
(Attiku et al., 2021):

1. Structural modalities: Fundus, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT),
Autoﬂuorescence (Attiku et al., 2021), Wideﬁeld Autoﬂuorescence (Al-
ber et al., 2020).

2. Vascular modalities: Fundus ﬂuorescence angiography and Optical Co-
herence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) (Attiku et al., 2021).
3. Functional modalities: electroretinogram (ERG) (Tsang and Sharma,

2018), various color and contrast tests (London et al., 2013).

Recently Vij and Arora (2022) have done a systematic survey of advances
in retinal modalities for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. They have
reviewed structural imaging modalities, functional modalities, and multi-
modal/paired imaging. Among all of these modalities, OCT is the modality
most commonly used (with a rate of 57%) in AD diagnosis since it is non-
invasive, cost-eﬃcient and easy to use. OCTA is a relatively new modality
that is receiving increasing attention. Various studies combine OCT and
OCTA to improve the performance of AD diagnosis (Wisely et al., 2022;
Salobrar-Garc´ıa et al., 2019; Querques et al., 2019). OCT and OCTA have
also been used in diagnosing various cognitive impairments (Chalkias et al.,
2021; Ge et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2018; Hui et al., 2021; Fereshetian et al., 2021;
MacGillivray et al., 2018; Romaus-Sanjurjo et al., 2022; Yeh et al., 2022; Kim
et al., 2022). The focus of this survey, OCT/OCTA, are the most promising
retinal imaging techniques that provide practical and cost-eﬀective diagnos-
tic for AD and cognitive impairment. However, neither is mature enough
yet.

2.2.1. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)

OCT is a non-invasive method used to obtain views of retinal structures
in two-dimensional (2D), cross-sectional and three-dimensional (3D) volu-
metric images (Snyder et al., 2020). OCT provides extensive information
regarding retinal morphology and assists in diagnosing many diseases (Fig-
ure 3). It generates structural images by detecting interference signals from
the reference mirror and the backscattering signals from the biological tissue
sample (see Figure 4).
It performs micrometer-resolution depth and den-
sity measurements. Time domain (TD-OCT), spectral domain (SD-OCT)
and swept source (SS-OCT) are the three main types of OCT. They diﬀer
in terms of A-scans per second (TD-OCT : 400,
in their scanning speeds:
SD-OCT: 20,000-40,000, SS-OCT : 100,000-400,000) (Song et al., 2021).

The last three-four years has witnessed an explosion in AD-related re-
search studies using OCT. Song et al. (2021) have done an extensive literature
review on diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease using OCT imaging modalities. A
common theme in these studies is to use quantitative parameters derived from
OCT scans of the retina instead of using 3D scans directly. The following
are the most common ﬁndings we compiled from OCT-based AD diagnosis
literature:

• The very ﬁrst observation noted by most studies is the thinning of the
retinal layers (Song et al., 2021). Several neurodegenerative diseases,
such as AD, dementia, and Parkinson’s disease, have a characteristic
signature of Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thinning. Figure 3
shows the layers of the retina. Retinal thinning often refers to the in-
ner layers such as the RNFL (also called Stratum opticum), Ganglion
Cell Layer (GCL), and Inner Plexiform Layer. These three layers are
called ganglion cell complexes. Ganglion cells are vulnerable to neu-
rodegeneration because of their related mitochondrial dysfunction and
their unique composition of having axons without myelination (Carelli
et al., 2017). Recent studies show that GCL is more likely associated
with brain biomarkers (Moran et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2022). Figure 5
shows an OCT output for an anonymized healthy patient. The RNFL
thickness values in both eyes are measured by the device and compared
against the reference database. OD is the left eye, and OS is the right
eye. The eye and the retina have a spherical shape. Therefore, 2D slice
visualization requires a circle to be mapped to a rectangle.

• Secondly highlighted observations are reduced macular volume and

dimensional detector array, and with the OCT technique facilitating scanning in depth, a

thickness. The macula provides sharp, clear, straight-ahead vision.
It is responsible for central and color vision (Bear et al., 2016). Figure
5 illustrates the macula region in the eye. The middle of the retina
images and their graphs show the thickness of the macula.

• Some studies found reduced choroidal volume and thickness (L´opez-De-
Eguileta et al., 2020; Gharbiya et al., 2014; Jonas et al., 2016; Trebbas-
toni et al., 2017), while others disagree with this ﬁnding (Song et al.,
2021; Bulut et al., 2018). The choroid layer is the supplier of nutrients
to the retina, and it also maintains the temperature and volume of the
eye (Bear et al., 2016).

2.2.2. Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA)

OCTA is a relatively new (2015) technique developed as a utility of OCT
devices. Put simply, it is computed as the diﬀerence between two consecu-
tive OCT scans to visualize the relative motion in the retina region, which
reveals blood ﬂow and vascular details at micrometer resolution.
It oﬀers
a very eﬀective imaging method in diagnosing eye diseases by unveiling mi-
crovascular changes or abnormalities in the blood ﬂow pattern (Figure 6).

decrease in a patient. OD (oculus dextrus) is the right eye, and OS (oculus sinister) is
the left eye. The eye has a spherical shape. The vertical area closer to the nose is called
Nasal Retina (NAS, N), and the other side is called Temporal Retina (TMP, T). The
upper retina from the fovea is Superior (SUP, S), and the lower part is inferior (INF, I).
Therefore, 2D visualization requires unfolding the circle to a rectangle (from TMP to SUP,
then to NAS and back to TMP). The Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) shown in the
middle image is automatically segmented by the OCT system; its thickness is measured
and compared against the European Descent reference database. The results show that
there is a borderline thinning on the right eye.

Figure 6: OCT angiogram of a normal eye illustrating detailed microvasculature in the
macula. The foveal avascular zone is seen in the center of the macula (Green, 2021).

Figure 6 shows an OCT angiography of a healthy eye. Besides not being
available in all OCT devices, it is susceptible to most OCT-induced distor-
tions such as projection, motion, segmentation, and signal loss (Attiku et al.,
2021).

In their survey, Song et al. (2021) also reviewed AD-related OCTA stud-

ies. Their major ﬁndings can be listed as follows:

• Reduced vessel density is reported in several studies (Ge et al., 2021;

Augustin and Atorf, 2022).

• Reduced perfusion density is also observed together with reduced vessel
density. Vessel perfusion density is deﬁned as the total area of perfused
vasculature per unit area (Triolo et al., 2017; Augustin and Atorf, 2022).

• Increased Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ) is reported by O’Bryhim et al.
(2021). The fovea can be seen in Figure 5 as the dark spot in the center
where it marks the center of the retina (Bear et al., 2016; Augustin and
Atorf, 2022).

• Reduced peripapillary vessel density, another parameter that requires
further research, is discussed in Ferrari et al. (2017). The radial peri-
papillary capillaries are a distinctive vascular network within the RNFL
around the optic disc, the area inside the circle in Figure 6.

3. Machine Learning in OCT/OCTA

Newly introduced medical tests and imaging techniques help physicians
diagnose diseases better. However, boosted by the advances in new imaging
modalities, every patient has become a “big data” challenge (Obermeyer and
Lee, 2017) with a history of large-scale, high-dimensional, multimodal med-
ical data. Diagnostic methods from this data greatly depend on physicians’
professional experience and knowledge. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
have improved the performance of many challenging tasks, especially when
working with high-resolution, multimodal, complex imaging data. Most of
these systems have evolved from rule-based expert systems to fully auto-
mated and skilled deep learning systems now being used as medical decision
support.

Classical machine learning techniques require four common steps:
fea-
ture extraction, dimensionality reduction, algorithm/model selection, and
feature-based learning (Figure 8). Artiﬁcial neural networks are a subset of
AI inspired by a simpliﬁcation of neurons and their connections in the brain.
Deep learning (DL) is a multi-layer structure of neural networks that learns
the features and high-dimensional non-linear functions by mimicking the neu-
ron connections and interactions in the human brain. After the 2010s, DL
gained momentum from Machine Learning (Lecun et al., 2015) because it can
learn from raw data by implicitly learning feature extraction, representation,
and classiﬁcation decision.

Tian et al. (2021b) reviewed application of the DL-based approach to dif-
ferent biomedical optical imaging ﬁelds such as microscopy, ﬂuorescence life-
time imaging, in vivo microscopy, wideﬁeld endoscopy, photoacoustic imaging
and sensing, diﬀuse tomography, and functional optical brain imaging. Un-
surprisingly, DL has also become the latest trend in the analysis of OCT and
OCTA scans (Tong et al., 2020; Ran and Cheung, 2021; Latha et al., 2021).
Figure 9 shows the number of DL studies on Fundus, OCT and OCTA images
reported by PubMed in the last six years. The limited number of publica-
tions related to OCTA reﬂects its recent development and late availability in
OCT devices.

The following are the major applications of deep learning in OCT/OCTA

modality (Tong et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2021b; Ran and Cheung, 2021):

• Denoising and Speckle Removal: Image quality improvement using
computer vision (CV) and ML is one of the hottest topics in medical
imaging. Due to the nature of the clinical practice, there are many

issues concerning the scanned images. Raw OCT slice images suﬀer
from speckle noise because of coherent light scattering (Figure 11).
Some devices have other noise sources due to low signal levels. There-
fore, DL-based image quality improvements are investigated in many
OCT/OCTA studies (Tian et al., 2021b; Ran and Cheung, 2021; Huang
et al., 2021). Retina scans for each patient are taken at diﬀerent times.
Therefore, the datasets contain multiple images taken from various
sensors at diﬀerent periods. Besides, the retina is a non-rigid moving
organ inside a moving body. Therefore, image registration may also
be needed to match multiple images before the segmentation (Pan and
Chen, 2021) or classiﬁcation processes.

• Image Segmentation: OCT devices reveal structural details of the
retina (see Section 2.2.1). Due to the layered structure of the retina,
segmentation of the layers is the most common problem addressed by
DL studies. Among all of the DL models, U-Net is the most popular
one. RNFL and GCL layer thicknesses are the critical parameters for
Alzheimer’s studies. New OCT devices can measure RNFL thickness
(Schott, 2020). However, other parameters such as the macula and
choroid layer size require further research before manufacturers incor-
porate these options into future devices. Blood vessel segmentation is

17

another parameter used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease. Even though
there is extensive research on Fundus Photography, OCTA is now a
trending technique that gives more information with higher-quality im-
ages (Fan et al., 2021). FAZ area segmentation is another new research
topic in DL (Mirshahi et al., 2021; Ran et al., 2021).

• Clinical Diagnosis and Classiﬁcation: OCT images are used to de-
tect various diseases such as Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD),
glaucoma, diabetic macular edema (DME), diabetic retinopathy, reti-
nal vein occlusion (RVO), choroidal neovascularization (CNV) (Latha
et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2014; Ran et al., 2021). Latha et al. (2021)
have reviewed studies on detecting ophthalmic disorders AMD, glau-
coma, and diabetic retinopathy using DL techniques. Ran et al. (2021)
did an extensive survey on DL techniques used to detect glaucoma.
All of these studies are on single eye diseases such as glaucoma, AMD,
etc. Eliminating multiple disease patients in these studies is a com-
mon practice that is not realistic from the diagnostic perspective. Ran
and Cheung (2021) reviewed the newer studies on deep learning-based
multiple retinal disease detection on OCT/OCTA.

• Prognosis Detection: Treatment response and progress need to be
assessed for diseases such as DME, CNV and RVO. OCT scans are used
to track the changes in response to intravitreal anti-VEGF (vascular
endothelial growth factor) agents in these diseases (Ran et al., 2021).

• Explainability: Despite their high performance, deep neural network
architectures are black box models. Trusting their predictions is essen-
tial in using them for decision-making in medicine. Ribeiro et al. (2016)
raised the question “Why Should I Trust You?” and argued that people
would trust a model more if they could understand the reasoning be-
hind its predictions. The most common interpretability method used in
OCT/OCTA, following other ﬁelds such as CT and MRI, is the Grad-
CAM method (Choi et al., 2021; Chueh et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021).
Singh et al. (2021) evaluated 13 explainability deep learning methods
for OCT scans. They assessed the Inception-v3 model that diagnoses
three diﬀerent diseases: CNV, DME and drusen, and found that the
Deep Taylor (DTaylor) method (Montavon et al., 2017) outperforms
the other techniques in OCT retinal images.

• Emerging Applications: Tian et al. (2021b) reviewed some emerg-
ing imaging modalities such as swept-source OCT (Eid et al., 2022;
Mopuru et al., 2022) and Doppler OCT (DOCT) (Wada et al., 2020)
that measure microangiography and blood ﬂow. These studies gained
momentum (see Figure 9) in the last couple of years because they are
also generating additional functional and vascular features on top of
anatomical features.

Bourkhime et al. (2022) recently presented a brief systematic review on
machine learning for AD screening using novel ophthalmologic biomarkers.
imaging
They found 13 ML-based studies,
modalities, and ML techniques. They identiﬁed only two studies (in PubMed
and Scopus databases) directly using OCT image data (Nunes et al., 2019;
Lemmens et al., 2020). We will analyze those studies in detail. In the fol-
lowing section, we present our systematic review which focuses speciﬁcally
on the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment from
OCT and OCTA scans. We further elaborate on the related datasets.

including various data types,

4. Review

This survey follows the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) (Page et al., 2021) to review
ML/DL-based approaches for AD or MCI diagnosis in OCT and/or OCTA
scans. Figure 10 shows the PRISMA ﬂow chart of our systemic review pro-
cess.

Information Sources: We performed an exhaustive search of English-
language studies from Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar,
Semantic Scholar and CrossRef from 01/01/2015 to 07/31/2022.

Search Strategy: We surveyed the databases using a software program
called Publish or Perish (Harzing, 2010) which retrieves and analyzes aca-
demic citations. Our search strategy was based on the following combination
of terms:

(“Alzheimer’s” OR “dementia” OR “cognitive impairment”) AND (“op-
tical coherence tomography” OR “optical coherence tomography angiography”
OR “Retinal Imaging”) AND (“Machine Learning” OR “Deep Learning”)

Eligibility criteria: Articles passing all the selection criteria were col-

lected. The articles were excluded if they:

• Are not available in English

19

• Are not published as a primary research paper in a peer-reviewed jour-

nal and are conference papers only;

• Do not describe the ML model for AD detection, screening or prediction

using OCT/OCTA scan images or derived data.

• Are duplicates, datasets or book chapters

• Include other diseases apart from AD (such as AMD, Drusen, etc.)

• Are only related to segmentation or image quality improvement.

• Study other modalities apart from OCT and OCTA scans.

• Include only statistical data analysis.

Data extraction, synthesis and analysis: We analyzed the eligible
studies and extracted information such as the number of participants, year
of publication, algorithms applied and their characteristics, model predic-
tion parameters, and model performance, including accuracy, discrimination
sensitivity, and speciﬁcity rates. The analysis results are explained in the
following section.

4.1. Results

The initial search returned 3073 references. After several steps of elimi-
nation (Figure 10), only ten were found eligible, including the two research
papers already identiﬁed by Bourkhime et al. (2022). Table 1 lists all the
publications that we have reviewed in detail.

Nunes et al. (2019) followed a classical machine learning ﬂow to discrimi-
nate between healthy (NC), Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD)
subjects. First, they segmented OCT volumes to extract retina layers, then
they computed the mean fundus image for the six retina layers (RNFL, GCL,
IPL, INL, OPL and ONL) (Guimar˜aes et al., 2014). They computed the
thickness of layers. Moreover, they computed Gray Level Co-occurrence Ma-
trix and wavelet transform to extract textural features based on the layer
images, resulting in 86 measurements per layer. The whole feature vector
was classiﬁed using a support vector classiﬁer. They reported 88.7%, 79.5%
and 77.8% median sensitivities for NC, AD and PD classes. Their ﬁndings
showed that the textural features calculated in diﬀerent retina layers may
provide valuable information that is independent of layer thickness measures.

MCI diagnosis using OCT and/or OCTA.

Sandeep et al. (2019) used a Fixed-Grid Wavenet Network (FGWN)
(Sandeep et al., 2017) for the segmentation of OCT scans to identify the
RNFL layer. Then they extracted morphological features such as area,
perimeter, curvature variance, ellipticity from the RNFL image. They com-
pared the back-propagation (BP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural net-
works for the classiﬁcation and concluded that the RBF (reported in terms
of false acceptance and false rejection rates). Their study concluded that the
segmentation algorithm played an important role in the automated diagnosis
of AD from OCT images.

Lemmens et al. (2020) combined snapshots of hyperspectral images with
OCT data to identify AD patients among 10 probable AD, 7 biomarkers-
proven AD and 22 NC subjects. Using hyperspectral images, they computed
average reﬂectance from four diﬀerent regions and combined this with RNFL
thickness in four diﬀerent eye regions (superior, inferior, temporal and nasal)
computed from the OCT. They reported an average area under the curve of
74% for the nested leave-one-out classiﬁcation accuracy.

Four other works experimented on animal subjects. The ﬁrst study by
Bernardes et al. (2017) used 4 and 8 months old 23 triple transgenic mice
with AD (3xTg-AD) and 22 wild-type (WT) control mice. They segmented
OCT scans into three layers. The ﬁrst layer contained RNFL, GCL, IPL,
INL and OPL. The second layer included the ONL and ELM, while the el-
lipsoid zone and RPE layers formed the third layer. Then they calculated
a vector of features (histogram of OCT images, mean value of fundus im-
ages, and energies and contrasts of OCT images from diﬀerent angles). The
classiﬁcation was performed by radial basis kernel SVMs. They compared
the performance for 4 and 8 months old mice and concluded that predictions
reached an accuracy over 80% for mice at the age of 4 months and over 90%
for those at the age of 8 months.

The second animal study (Trindade, 2021) worked with 57 3xTg-AD and
58 WT mice Healthy Cohort (HC). They segmented OCT data to compute
six diﬀerent images corresponding to the following layers/layer-aggregates:
RNFL-GCL, IPL, INL, OPL, ONL, and the total retina (TR), which en-
compasses all anatomical layers. They implemented six convolutional deep
learning models (CNN), Inception-v3 to learn and classify fundus images
computed from six diﬀerent layered AD and HC OCT scans. They reported
that RNFL-GCL achieved the highest classiﬁcation accuracy (89.2%). Feed-
ing the output of six CNNs into a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) to
combine information from diﬀerent layers did not improve the classiﬁcation

22

performance further. The study also used GradCAM explanations to pro-
duce heat maps of the most eﬀective areas for classiﬁcation. Moreover, they
noted that the right eye and the left eye may convey diﬀerent information.
The third study with mice was performed by Sayeed et al. (2022) with 24
3xTg-AD and 2256 WT mice. Their study tested various ML methods such
as decision trees, neural networks, random forest and SVM. They generated
22 diﬀerent features (e.g. contrast, sum entropy, diﬀerence entropy) from
a normalized covariance matrix of Fundus and OCT images. SVM has the
highest performance results (Accuracy 99%, Sensitivity 98% and Speciﬁcity
99%). The performance of the decision tree (Accuracy 96%, Sensitivity 94%
and Speciﬁcity 97%) was the second best, while the neural network achieved
the worst performance (Accuracy 74%, Sensitivity 98%, Speciﬁcity 73%).

Ferreira et al. (2022) performed the latest study with mice using 57 3xTg-
AD and 57 WT mice at diﬀerent ages. They generated mean-value-fundus
(MVF) images from segmented OCT layers RNFL-GCL, IPL, INL, OPL and
ONL. The images were pre-processed to increase the performance, and a data
augmentation technique was used to reduce over-ﬁtting. Transfer learning
from the inception-v3 model was used for training the network with mice at
3,4 and 8 months. For the classiﬁcation tests, 1,2 and 12 months old mice
were used. They concluded that the best performance was obtained using
MVF data calculated using the RNFL-GCL (Accuracy 88.1%, Sensitivity
87.7%, Speciﬁcity 88.5%, and F1 score 88.5%). They also measured the error
rates of mice at diﬀerent ages. As expected, there were smaller classiﬁcation
errors with validation data than with the test data. They also concluded
that the total classiﬁcation error at 12-months-old (15%) was smaller than 2-
months-old (16.9%) even though 2-months-old was much closer to the trained
age group.

A recent study performed by Wisely et al. (2022) employed a deep resid-
ual convolutional model (ResNet18) to detect AD using multimodal reti-
nal images. They used image data (Color maps of GC-IPL thickness of
OCTA, OCTA, ultra-wideﬁeld (UWF) color and fundus autoﬂuorescence im-
ages), numerical data (such as RNFL thickness information) obtained from
OCT/OCTA and patient information as simultaneous input to an artiﬁcial
neural network (ANN) through separate channels. Two-dimensional images
were fed into convolutional neural network branches, and OCT-based numer-
ical information and patient information were processed in a fully connected
subnet structure. They found GC-IPL to be the best performing input (AUC
0.809). GC-IPL was calculated over OCT like RNFL, reﬂecting a measure-

23

ment superimposed on OCTA in the corresponding study. It was stated that
the combination of numerical information obtained from OCT and GC-IPL
images gave the highest classiﬁcation performance (AUC 0.841). Non-OCT
modalities such as FFA and UWF do not improve classiﬁcation performance.
The study is important in demonstrating the eﬀectiveness of GC-IPL and
OCTA (AUC 0.828). Though the study used quantitative data and patient
information to support 284 eye images from 159 patients, the data size was
still quite limited, which is the top known cause of overﬁtting in neural net-
works. The dataset was collected in a cross-sectional study ((ClinicalTrials,
2022), NTC03233646).

Finally, our manual search yielded two patents. The ﬁrst patent appli-
cation by Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc. (Patent No: US 6,988,995 B2) claimed
a method based on artiﬁcial neural networks and RNFL Images to classify
Alzheimer’s disease. The second patent application by the National Chin-Yi
University of Technology, Chi Medical Center (Patent No: US 11,288,801
B2) claimed CNN-based methods for both segmentation and classiﬁcation of
OCT images.

We could not ﬁnd any research study on cognitive impairment with
OCT/OCTA data using an ML model, even though there are two recent
studies that use fundus images (Corbin and Lesage, 2022; Zhang et al., 2021).
However, we observed new data collection initiatives to include MCI cases
(Section 4.2).

Yanagihara et al. (2020) reviewed the issues concerning DL in OCT for
retinal diseases. They highlighted the issues of limited number of datasets,
lack of image collection standards, inconsistent metrics, and computational
restrictions. Even though all of these challenges apply to all works, it seems
as if the study of AD or MCI requires further consideration because we could
identify only ten AD studies out of 3073 deep learning studies. The following
section explains our search on related datasets.

4.2. OCT/OCTA Datasets

In a 2020 review, Yanagihara et al. (2020) identiﬁed the lack of publicly
available OCT/OCTA datasets as a signiﬁcant obstacle for developing deep
learning-based approaches to retinal diseases. During our survey, we observed
that the situation has not improved much. Most clinics collect local datasets
with a limited number of patients for their own research. Basically, the AD-
OCT data collection attempts remain local and private (Bulut et al., 2016,
2018; Bayhan et al., 2015; Nunes et al., 2019; Querques et al., 2019; Tian

et al., 2021b; Ma et al., 2021; Lemmens et al., 2020). This is perhaps due to
the fact that collecting AD-related data requires substantial eﬀort:

• A recognized Ethics Committee should approve any medical data collec-
tion involving human subjects, and analysis should apply the principles
stated in the “World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: Ethi-
cal principles for medical research involving human subjects” (WorldMed-
icalAssociation, 2013).

• All patients or their legal representative (for AD patients who cannot

sign for themselves) should sign a written consent.

• All subjects should undergo clinical neurologic and neuropsychologic
assessment (see Section 2.2) to determine their AD level. Patients with
AD are excluded if there is a history or evidence of other neurologic or
psychiatric disorders or other types of dementia.

• Especially in OCT/OCTA studies, ophthalmologists should exclude pa-
tients with other diseases such as diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hy-
pertension, cardiovascular diseases, retinal diseases (e.g. AMD), glau-
coma, ocular disorders (trauma, surgery, inﬂammation). Some studies
even exclude smoking (Bayhan et al., 2015).

• Cognitively healthy (HC) subjects with ages matched to AD subjects
should be recruited for the study. Usually, AD subjects are over 65-70
years old.

• Either issues concerning inconsistent and low-quality images should
be resolved or the images with unresolved issues should be excluded.
OCT is known to produce various image artefacts due to factors such
as movement and signal loss.

• Medical images should be read, assessed and marked by experts. Most
of the time, the results need to be veriﬁed by more than one expert.

Data collection usually extends over several years. After the data is col-
lected it is usually kept local as there are strict data privacy rules that impede
data sharing among researchers. However, publicly available medical data is
priceless for academic research. For example, the Alzheimer’s Disease Neu-
roimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal multicenter study designed to

27

develop clinical, imaging, genetic and biochemical biomarkers for the early
detection and tracking of AD (ADNI, 2022). This extensive dataset, col-
lected in various phases and collaborations, is open to public access for re-
searchers. Unfortunately, opthalmology has no global public dataset similar
to ADNI. Khan et al. (2021) did extensive research on public datasets that
contain ophthalmologic health information. Bissig et al. (2020b) published
the only publicly available AD dataset (14 AD and NC patients) on the
Dryad site (Bissig et al., 2020a). They studied light-dependency changes
in retinal reﬂectivity on glial cell function as a new biomarker for AD. The
images were taken either in the dark or bright, stimulating light. Therefore,
they were not consistent with standard AD datasets. There are other local,
non-AD data collection initiatives such as Retinal OCTA Vessel Segmenta-
tion Dataset (ROSE) (Ma et al., 2021) and Annotated Retinal OCT Images
(AROI) database (Melinˇsˇcak et al., 2021).

Alzheimer’s Association in the United States supports a collective ini-
tiative called the Atlas of Retinal Imaging in Alzheimer’s Study (ARIAS)
(Alber et al., 2020). In this study they deﬁned a “minimum dataset” frame-
work for SD-OCT retinal image acquisition and analysis. Then, there is an
ongoing data collection initiative in accordance with this framework (Alber
et al., 2020b) (See Table 2). The dataset was planned to be a publicly avail-
able longitudinal study of structural, functional, metabolic and angiographic
retinal AD biomarkers in a large cohort (N=330 aged 55-80; 50 NC–low AD
risk, 200 NC–high AD risk, 50 MCI, and 30 mild AD). There are other ini-
tiatives for standardizing retinal OCTA imaging as discussed in the review
by Sampson et al. (2022).

UK Biobank (UK Biobank, 2022; Chua et al., 2019) oﬀers an extensive
biomedical database containing genetic and health data collected from half
a million UK participants. The database is open to researchers, but at a
cost. This database includes all the clinical examinations, physical, mental
and ophthalmologic data with demographic information, OCT scans, derived
OCT, and AD measures for each patient. Therefore, it is a complete resource
for studying AD-related changes in the eye. OCT scans of 84,778 UK patients
(both eyes) were acquired by TOPCON 3D OCT 1000 Mk 2 device and stored
in TOPCON (.fda and .fds) and image (.png) formats. Figure 11 shows one
of 128 OCT slices from the UK Biobank dataset. Tian et al. (2021a) used
fundus images and related data from this dataset to classify AD from the
retinal vasculature.

AlzEye is another major UK-based data collection initiative run by Moor-

speckles and noise that need to be cleaned before using in any study.

ﬁeld Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (Wagner et al., 2022). The data
was collected from 353,157 participants between 2008 and 2018. This data
collection is the most extensive ophthalmology data for Alzheimer’s disease.
More than six million retinal images of seven diﬀerent modalities (Color Fun-
dus, Red-free photograph, fundus autoﬂuorescence (wideﬁeld), pseudocolor
photography (wideﬁeld), OCT and OCTA) were collected using devices from
three diﬀerent vendors (Topcon, Heidelberg and Optos). The dataset is not
public yet.

There are newer OCT/OCTA dataset collection initiatives concerning
Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease patients (Yoon et al.,
2019). Our ClinicalTrials (2022) database search returned ten other ongoing
data collection initiatives on Optical Coherence Tomography and Alzheimer’s
Disease, summarized in Table 2.

Generating synthetic data by learning previously collected AD datasets is
sometimes useful in improving the accuracy of classiﬁers. Even though this
may increase the AD sample size, it may lead to a sample bias. Danesh et al.
(2021) have devised a method called Active Shape Modeling (ASM) (Cootes
et al., 1995) to generate 3D OCT images with similar anomalies to expand
their training datasets.

5. Discussion

We surveyed and reviewed the ML or DL-based studies to detect or di-
agnose AD in OCT and OCTA scans. We aimed to investigate the medical
and technical background of the problem thoroughly and reviewed existing
technical proposals and datasets.

Our survey of the medical literature has revealed the most recent ﬁndings
about AD-related changes in the retina, which are observable through OCT
examination. The current literature focuses on layer thickness changes in
particular retinal layers such as Retinal Nerve Fiber, Ganglion Cell, and
Inner-Plexiform Layers. Usually, the OCT scan is segmented automatically
(sometimes with manual interventions) to identify these layers; and then
layer average thickness values are computed. Medical studies have revealed
that the average thickness of those layers in AD and normal patients show
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence.

Our survey of technical literature has revealed that the proposals for
enhancing and analyzing the scans are growing exponentially. Currently,

30

the ML or DL-based scene is populated by automatic segmentation stud-
ies or clinical diagnosis and classiﬁcation of other diseases such as glaucoma
and diabetic retinopathy. Some works based on neural networks already ex-
ploit explainability tools such as GradCAM (Selvaraju et al., 2020), DTaylor
(Montavon et al., 2017) in OCT and OCTA modalities.

Our PRISMA-based (Page et al., 2021) systematic review of the ML/DL
approaches to AD or MCI diagnosis in OCT scans has extended the re-
cent review of Bourkhime et al. (2022) on AD diagnosis using OCT-based
biomarkers. We identiﬁed eight additional studies, four of which used mice
subjects and two of which were US Patents. We observed that the scene from
classical machine learning pipeline is moving towards neural networks-driven
fully automated classiﬁcation. In this transformation, we observed the use
of speciﬁc layer thickness measurements and hand-crafted textural metrics
on images as features (inputs). In addition, the sample sizes in the reviewed
works were quite limited, usually containing less than 50 AD subjects. A full
deep learning solution to process raw OCT scans as input has not been devel-
oped yet, probably because it would require substantially more AD subjects.
As expected, the diﬀerent methods are not yet comparable to each other
because they all use diﬀerent datasets and accuracy measures.

The study by Wisely et al. (2022) was the only work that used OCTA im-
ages and other data together in a neural network-based structure. Although
they have tried other imaging modalities (e.g. ultra-wideﬁeld color and fun-
dus autoﬂuoresence) as well, they have found that color maps of Ganglion
Cell Inner Plexiform Layer thickness overlayed on OCTA was the best input
for AD vs. non-AD classiﬁcation. Using OCT/OCTA numerical data (e.g.
RNFL thickness, area of foveal avascular zone) and patient data (demograph-
ics and MMSE scores) together with GC-IPL was found to be the best input
combination.

OCTA is a relatively new technique developed as a byproduct of OCT
scans.
It computes the diﬀerence between two consecutive OCT scans to
reveal blood ﬂow and micro-vascular retinal structure at micrometer resolu-
tion. So far, medical research has identiﬁed reduced vessel density in diﬀer-
ent regions and increased foveal zone in AD patients. AD-related research
in both OCT and OCTA modalities seems to be just gaining momentum.
Presumably, more biomarkers will be discovered with the increasing support
expected from the technical side.

Deep Learning models are data hungry. Therefore, most of the ML/DL
studies (Wisely et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2021a; Lee et al., 2017; Thakoor et al.,

31

2022) have used both eyes (left and right) to double the dataset size. Nunes
et al. (2019) found that when both eyes received the same classiﬁcation, the
classiﬁcation accuracy improved from 82% to 96% in this group.

Most relevant research used 2D OCTA images or OCT computed thick-
ness values.
Increasing computational power and cloud services allow 3D
volumetric retinal images to be analyzed. Working with 3D OCT scans may
also change the design of the problem and speed up the search for novel
biomarkers. However, such a dramatic increase of input dimensionality will
require substantially more data.

Publicly available data is a priceless resource for academic research. Yanag-
ihara et al. (2020) listed four challenges of deep learning approaches to OCT
image analysis: 1) lack of large datasets, 2) non-standardized image acqui-
sition and preprocessing, 3) limited computational power, 4) inconsistency
of reporting metrics. Two years later, our survey on AD or MCI-related
datasets has shown no signiﬁcant improvements, which seems to be the main
issue against the development of deep learning approaches. We found that
UK Biobank oﬀers its database to global researchers applying via a research
proposal. Although access to the database requires a compensation fee, there
are reduction schemes to support research students. AlzEye initiative by
Wagner et al. (2022) seems to be currently the largest dataset for ophthalmic
images. However, the dataset is not yet open to the public, although it may
become available through collaboration.

Nevertheless, AD opthalmology requires a large-scale global dataset such
as Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (ADNI, 2022), which
includes MRI, PET, and related data of thousands of subjects collected by
the ADNI and their collaborative studies. The data will be the main obstacle
impeding progress in the ﬁeld until such a dataset is created. .

Table 2 lists many local ongoing data collection initiatives which are
promising. One of the signiﬁcant eﬀorts is by Alzheimer’s Association in
the United States which supports a large-scale (16 instituions) longitudinal
data collection study: the Atlas of Retinal Imaging in Alzheimer’s Study
(ARIAS) (Alber et al., 2020). To support the initiative, they have deﬁned a
“minimum dataset” framework to standardize SD-OCT retinal image acqui-
sition and analysis. More initiatives using the minimum framework would
help solve both the open dataset problem and standardization issues.

Alzheimer’s disease patients are aged people with more potential for mul-
tiple dementia (Gaugler et al., 2022) and multiple retinal diseases such as
age-related macular degeneration (Zhang et al., 2022). There were vari-

32

ous studies on deep learning-based multiple retinal disease detection using
OCT/OCTA (Ran et al., 2021). Unfortunately, none of them included AD
or MCI. In new data collection initiatives, multi-disease AD samples could
also be included in the datasets to allow diﬀerential diagnostic studies on AD
diagnosis with multi-retinal diseases.

Alzheimer’s disease is a prolonged progressive disease. Therefore, detec-
tion of the disease in its early stages is vital. During our research, we observed
that despite an increasing focus on early/mild cognitive impairment, there
are no deep learning and/or machine learning studies on MCI yet. Once
datasets such as Alber et al. (2020) become available, we can expect to see
more studies on this topic.

6. Conclusion

In this study, we surveyed the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease and Cog-
nitive Impairment using OCT and OCTA imaging of the retina. Our sur-
vey included an introduction to the medical background of the diseases and
a review of various technical proposals from an automated image analysis
perspective. We reviewed recent (2015-2022) deep learning approaches and
OCT/OCTA datasets directly aiming at AD and MCI diagnosis. We iden-
tiﬁed eight ML/DL studies and two patents aiming at AD diagnosis, which
shows that the research ﬁeld is still in the conception phase. Our survey
on datasets identiﬁed the lack of open OCT/OCTA datasets about AD as
the main issue impeding the progress in the ﬁeld. We observed that there
are many recent initiatives for OCT data collection aiming at AD diagnosis.
Some important longitudinal dataset initiatives such as ARIAS are promis-
ing to fuel the progress in the ﬁeld. In addition, there is an increasing focus
on MCI and OCT in clinical studies since MCI can be an early cursor for
AD. Even though there are no machine learning and/or deep learning studies
on this topic yet, it will attract attention when the datasets become avail-
able. The current studies usually leave out data acquired from patients with
other eye diseases or abnormalities that are frequently seen in the elderly
population. The development of a realistic diagnostic tool that can diﬀeren-
tiate between MCI, AD, and other diseases in OCT scans will require larger,
comprehensive, and open-access datasets.
