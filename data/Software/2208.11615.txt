The detection of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is among the leading scien-
tiﬁc goals of the space-borne gravitational wave observatory, which would have signiﬁcant impacts
on astrophysics and fundamental physics. In this work, we developed a null channel data analy-
sis software, TQSGWB, which can extract isotropic SGWB using the null channel method based on
TianQin detector. We ﬁnd that for the noise cross spectrum, the oftenly ignored imaginary compo-
nents in previous studies play an important role in breaking the degeneracy of position noise in the
common laser link. We demonstrate that the parameters of various signals and instrumental noise
could be estimated directly in the absence of galactic confusion foreground through Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampling. With only three-month observation, we ﬁnd that TianQin could be able to
conﬁdently detect SGWBs with energy density as low as ΩPL = 1.3 × 10−12, ΩFlat = 6.0 × 10−12,
and ΩSP = 9.0 × 10−12, for power-law, ﬂat, and single peak models respectively.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) [1–
3] can be produced by the incoherent superposition of
large numbers of independent and unresolved gravita-
tional wave sources. According to the diﬀerent physical
mechanisms and historical epochs that contributed to the
SGWB, it could be classiﬁed into two major types:

Astrophysical origin. This class includes Galactic fore-
ground contributed from Galactic double white dwarfs
(DWDs) [4], and extra-galactic backgrounds produced
by the inspiral and merger of compact binaries, such as
massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) [5], stellar-mass
black hole binaries (SBBHs) [6, 7], and extreme mass
ratio inspirals (EMRIs) [8, 9].

The Galactic foreground is comparable with detector
noise, thus is the most distinctive. The Galactic ori-
gin also made it anisotropic. On the other hand, the
extra-galactic background is generally expected to be
spatially homogeneous, Gaussian, stationary, unpolar-
ized, and isotropic. The detection of such SGWB can
provide important astrophysical information about the
source populations, like the mass distribution of the bi-
nary, the merger rate evolution, and even the formation
mechanisms [10–12].

Cosmological origin. It has been suggested that var-
ious processes in the early Universe[13, 14],
including
inﬂation [15, 16], ﬁrst-order phase transition [17–19],
and networks of topological defects (e.g., cosmic strings)
[20, 21] can contribute to the SGWB. The cosmologi-
cal SGWB thus encodes precious information about the
early Universe, and the detection of it has the potential to
signiﬁcantly improve our understanding of the processes

that shaped the early Universe and particle physics be-
yond the standard model [22]. For example, one can
decipher the energy scale and slope of inﬂation potential,
as well as the initial quantum states during inﬂation by
observing the relic gravitational wave (RGW) [23].

The search for SGWB with current experiments, like
Advanced LIGO [24], Advanced Virgo [25], and pulsar
timing arrays (PTAs) [26–28] are carried out actively.
Meanwhile, relevant investigations with future experi-
ments, like Einstein telescope (ET) [29], cosmic explorer
(CE) [30, 31], as well as space-borne missions such as
laser interferometer space antenna (LISA) [32] and Tian-
Qin [33] are also performed. With data accumulated
during Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo’s ﬁrst ob-
serving run (O1) till third observing run (O3), no obser-
vational evidence for SGWB has been reported oﬃcally
from the LIGO Scientiﬁc Collaboration, the Virgo Col-
laboration and the KAGRA Collaboration (LVK), which
places an upper limit on the dimensionless energy den-
sity Ωgw ≤ 5.8 × 10−9 for a frequency-independent (ﬂat)
SGWB [34]. Recently, the NANOGrav Collaboration re-
cently reported an interesting common-spectrum process
that can not be easily explained by noise, yet no strong
support of quadrupolar spatial correlations can be con-
cluded [35]. Such observation have been later conﬁrmed
by PPTA [36] and EPTA [37]. Many hypotheses have
been proposed to explain the observed common-spectrum
process, including cosmic strings, dark phase transitions,
or scalar transverse polarization mode [38–46]. But more
observation is needed to draw deﬁnitive conclusions.

Since the statistical property of the SGWB is indistin-
guishable from the instrumental noise, it is challenging
to identify SGWB with one interferometer, unless the
strength is comparable or even larger than the instru-
mental noise, as in the case of the Galactic foreground.
In principle, one can use the cross-correlation method to
identify the existence of SGWB with multiple detectors,
using the fact that SGWB recorded by multiple detec-

 
 
 
 
 
 
tors are correlated, while noise in diﬀerent detectors are
statistically independant [1, 47–50]. For the special case
of a triangular-shaped gravitational wave (GW) detector,
one can construct a signal-insensitive data stream, also
known as the null channel, which has been suggested that
can play the role of a noise monitoring channel, and can
be further used to search for SGWB [51, 52]. The va-
lidity of such method had been established through the
analysis on the mock LISA data challenge [53, 54].

Many interesting work have emerged for more realistic
and robust study of SGWB. For example, [55] proposed
a search method based on principal component analy-
sis (PCA), so that no a priori assumption of SGWB
spectral shape is needed. Other spectrum-agnostic meth-
ods have also been developed [56–58]. Methods like
adaptive Markov chain Monte-Carlo have been proposed
to identify multi-component backgrounds [59, 60]. And
advances have been made to identify the anisotropy of
SGWB [61–64]

In this paper we focus on the mHz frequency band,
developed a search method for SGWB with space-borne
GW missions like TianQin [33, 65, 66], which we call
TQSGWB. We study the detection capability of TianQin to
SGWB in the absence of Galactic confusion foreground.
We ﬁnd that the imaginary part of the noise cross spec-
trum, which was mostly overlook in the ﬁeld, can break
the degeneracy of position noise in common laser link.
We demonstrated the detection capability of TianQin for
three representative SGWB spectra, as well as its detec-
tion limits.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we in-
troduce the fundamentals of the SGWB and the three
representative spectra. In Sec. III, we describe in detail
the noise model of the TianQin detector and its response
function. In Sec. IV, we show how one could simulate
the data stream by using the power spectral density of
SGWB and noise, and also brieﬂy describe the Bayesian
analysis technique, as well as our main results. We ﬁnally
draw our conclusions and discuss possible extensions of
this work in Sec. V.

II. FUNDAMENTALS OF STOCHASTIC
GRAVITATIONAL-WAVE BACKGROUND

In the transverse-traceless gauge, the metric perturba-
tions hij(t, (cid:126)x) corresponding to SGWB can be written as
a superposition of plane waves having frequency f and
propagating in the direction of ˆk:

hij(t, (cid:126)x) =

where (cid:104)...(cid:105) denotes the ensemble average, and Sh(f ) is
the one-sided power spectral density (PSD), which is re-
lated to the fracional energy density spectrum Ωgw(f ) of
SGWB as

Here, ρgw is the GWs energy density, ρc = 3H 2
0 /(8πG)
represents the critical density, H0 is the Hubble con-
stant, for which we assume a ﬁducial value of H0 =
67 km1 s−1Mpc−1 throughout this work [67].

We consider three representative scenarios as follows:
SGWB from the compact binary coalescencess (CBCs)
(power-law), a scale invariant inﬂationary SGWB (ﬂat),
and a single peak spectrum (Gaussian-bump).

• Power-law spectrum

CBCs are among the most promising GW sources
for the mHz frequency band [6, 65, 68]. Based on
the numerous observations from current ground-
based GW detectors [69–73], preliminary study re-
veals that CBC can form detectable SGWB for
TianQin [74]. The analytic model describing the
CBCs background depends on redshift and merger
rates [75, 76], whereas the energy of the inspirals
can be described by a power-law (PL) spectrum
[76–78]

ΩCBCs(f ) = ΩPL

(cid:18) f
fref

(cid:19)2/3

,

(5)

where ΩPL denotes the amplitude level at reference
frequency fref . We inject a power-law SGWB with
a ﬁducial value of amplitude ΩPL = 4.4×10−12 and
fref = 3 mHz[79, 80].

• Flat spectrum

The slow-roll inﬂation can produce a cosmological-
origined SGWB through the ampliﬁcation of vac-
uum ﬂuctuations [81–84]. The spectrum and am-
plitude of such signals strongly depend on the ﬂuc-
tuation power spectrum developed during the early
inﬂationary period. In the TianQin detection fre-
quency regime, the inﬂationary background is ex-
pected to be scale invariant (ﬂat)

ΩInﬂation(f ) = ΩFlat.

(6)

And we choose Ω0 = 1.0 × 10−11 as the ﬁducial
value.

• Gaussian-bump spectrum

Many physical mechanisms in the very early
Universe can produce SGWB with a spectrum
peaks around certain frequency,
including non-
perturbative eﬀects during post-inﬂationary pre-
heating, strong ﬁrst order phase transitions dur-
ing the thermal era of the Universe [18, 85–89], or
merging of primordial black holes (PBHs) during
the early Universe [18, 19]. In the following analy-
sis, we consider a phenomenological spectrum of a
Gaussian-bump (or single-peaked) model [90, 91],

(cid:40)

ΩBump = ΩSP exp

−

(cid:41)

,

(7)

and we adopt ΩSP = 1.0 × 10−11, ∆ = 0.2, fref =
3 mHz as the input parameters [57, 58].

We remind the readers that the Galactic foreground
from the DWDs can be dominating in certain frequency
range. However, some assumptions adopted in our follow-
ing analysis does not hold for the Galactic foreground (as
it is anisotropic and strong). Therefore we concentrate
on the background alone, and will leave the more realis-
tic analysis of both the Galactic foreground and isotropic
backgrounds in the future.

III. PRINCIPALS FOR SGWB DETECTIONS
WITH TIANQIN

Throughout this work, we consider TianQin as our
ﬁducial detector. It has been proposed that the success-
ful operation of TianQin can reveal great amount of ex-
citing science, such as the origin and evolution of black
holes and multi black hole systems [5], the astrophysics
of compact binaries[6], the surroundings and nature of
black holes[9, 92], the nature of the gravity [93], the ex-
pansion of the Universe [94, 95], and so on [66, 74]. The
TianQin mission will be composed with three drag-free
satellites, forming an equilateral triangle constellation or-
biting the Earth with an orbital radius of about 105 km,
and it adopts a three months on and three months oﬀ
(3+3) operational model [96, 97].

(8)

Here ˆrij is the unit vector from satellite i pointing to
satellite j, Lij is the arm-length between satellite i and
j, c is the light speed. The GW strain is given by

ψij(t) =

h(f, t − L/c, (cid:126)xi) : (ˆrij ⊗ ˆrij)T (f, ˆrij · ˆk)
2L

,

(9)

where T (f, ˆrij · ˆk) is the transfer function of interferom-
eter to GW for each arm [98–101].

The laser frequency noise C(t) is usually several orders
of magnitude higher than other noise. If left untreated,
the laser frequency noise will dominate the data and
make GW impossible. To suppress laser frequency noise,
the time delay interferometry (TDI) technique [51, 102–
105] has been proposed and applied in the analysing of
space-borne GW detections. The principle of TDI is to
combine multiple time-shifted laser links into equivalent
equal-arm interferometer to cancel the laser frequency
noise. Depending on the complexity of the considered
satellite motion, the TDI combinations for a Michelson
interferometer can be classiﬁed into diﬀerent generations:
TDI generation 1.0 assumes a static conﬁguration, TDI
generation 1.5 considered a rigid but rotating constella-
tion, and TDI generation 2.0 takes the constant changing
of arm-length into account [105, 106]. In this work, we
concentrate on TDI generation 1.5 for our analysis.

With the output phases from six diﬀerent links, it is
possible to built three virtual equal arm channels that
we call channel X, Y , and Z. The equivalence of arm-
length L cancels the laser frequency noise. We illustrate
the Michelson type variable of X channel with the TDI
generation 1.5 as [53]

X(t) = (cid:2)Φ12(t − 3L/c) + Φ21(t − 2L/c)
+ Φ13(t − L/c) + Φ31(t)(cid:3)
−(cid:2)Φ13(t − 3L/c) + Φ31(t − 2L/c)
+ Φ12(t − L/c) + Φ21(t)(cid:3).

A. Noise Model

Laser links will be established between TianQin satel-
lites, and the detection of GW signal is implemented
through laser interferometry. Let us consider the laser
link from satellite i to satellite j, the time series of the
recorded laser phase Φij(t) are composed with contribu-
tions from possible GW signals ψij(t) and noise, while
the noise can be further classiﬁed into laser frequency
noise C, position noise np, and acceleration noise (cid:126)na:

Φij(t) = Ci(t − Lij/c) − Cj(t) + ψij(t) + np

ij(t)

(11)

Here u = f /f∗, and f∗ = c/(2πL) is the characteristic
frequency. The others TDI variables Y and Z, can be
obtained by cyclic permutation of indices: 1 → 2 → 3 →
1 in the Eqs. (11).

Under the assumption that the position and accelera-
tion noise for all the arms are identical and uncorrelated,
three orthogonal TDI channels A, E, and T could be
constructed [104, 105, 107]:

A =

Z − X
√
2

, E =

X − 2Y + Z
√

, T =

X + Y + Z

. (12)

The A and E channels are sensitive to GW signals, can
has similar properties to Michelson channels, but the T
channel is signal insensitive under the low-frequency ap-
proximation (or long wavelength limit), and is also re-
ferred to as the null channel or noise monitoring channel.
The noise power spectral density (PSD) of each channel
can than be analytically expressed as [58]

(cid:104)NAA∗ (cid:105) = (cid:104)NEE∗ (cid:105) = 8 sin2 u

shown in the Appendix A. It is worth emphasizing that
the position noise contributions have imaginary compo-
nents, which mainly comes from eiu in the second term
of Eqs. (11), for example,

(15)
From Eqs. (A2) and (15), one can observe that the
sums of the position and acceleration noise contributions
in each arm of the interferometer, e.g., Sa,p
31 , al-
ways appear together in the autocorrelation PSDs and
the real-part of some cross-spectra components. On the
other hand, the diﬀerences of the position noise contri-
butions in each arm appear only in the imaginary part
of the cross-spectra,e.g., Sp
21. This suggest that
if only the real components are considered, then certain
parameters are degenerate, like Sp
21. However,
the consideration of the imaginary component can break
such degeneracy. Thus, one can expect that the con-
straints on the position noise parameters will be better
than the acceleration noise parameters.

where Npos = 1.0 × 10−24 and Nacc = 1.0 × 10−30 are the
noise amplitude parameters. These TianQin noise power
spectral densities are shown in Fig. 1. With the can-
cellation of laser frequency noise, the acceleration noise
dominates the noise at low frequencies, while position
noise dominates at high frequencies.

B. Response function

In general, the output of each channel in an interfer-
ometer consists of the instrumental noise and the signal,
which can be expressed in the frequency domain as

dI (f ) = nI (f ) + hI (f ), I = {A, E, T }.

(16)

Here, n(f ) is the instrumental noise, and h(f ) represents
the interferometric response to the SGWB

the auto- and cross spectra of stationary noise and signal
as

Upon this point, we have adopted an important as-
sumption, that noises from diﬀerent arms are identical,
ij = Sa, and Sp
Sa
ij = Sp, naturally the cross-spectrum
components (cid:104)NAE∗(cid:105) will vanish. However, if we account
for the diﬀerences between diﬀerent arms, then one must
account for the cross-spectral components. The details

p((cid:126)θ|D) =

(22)

where p((cid:126)θ|D), L((cid:126)θ|D) = p(D|(cid:126)θ), p((cid:126)θ), and p(D) =
(cid:82) L((cid:126)θ|D) p((cid:126)θ)d(cid:126)θ are posterior, likelihood, prior, and evi-
dence, respectively. The evidence plays a role of normal-
ising the posterior over parameter space.

Despite the relatively simple expression,

it is not
straightforward to map the posterior distribution over
parameter space eﬃciently. In practice, stochastic sam-
pling methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
have been widely adopted to numerically approximate
the posterior distribution. Brute force methods like
grid-based search suﬀers from the “curse of dimension-
ality”, while MCMC can eﬃciently sample in high di-
mensional parameter space. Unlike brute force methods,
once tuned, the MCMC methods can eﬃciently sample
the parameter space, therefore we adopt the MCMC to
obtain the posterior distribution. Speciﬁcally, we choose
the popular implementation of the aﬃne invariant en-
semble sampler, emcee [120] for this work.

In addition to the posterior distribution, one also face
the problem of model selection, or to identify which
model is better supported by the observed data. This
is usually done by calculating the odds ratio p(M1|D)
p(M0|D) be-
tween the models M1 and M0. We observe

p(M1|D)
p(M0|D)

=

p(D|M1)
p(D|M0)

p(M1)
p(M0)

,

(23)

which states that the odds ratio can be expressed as the
product of the Bayes factor p(D|M1)
p(D|M0) and the prior odds
p(M1)
p(M0) . We set the prior odds to unit so that the data
can dominate, and therefore we focus on the Bayes factor
for the remaining of the work. The calculation of Bayes
factor is enabled through calculating of evidence under
both models using the nested sampling (NS) algorithm
dynesty [121]

Throughout this work, we set the piror on the spec-
tral
index to be uniform, and the prior on other
parameters to be logarithmically uniform , such as
log10 ΩPL ∈ U[−15, −9],
ij ∈ U[−43, −39],
log10 Sp

the average response function RII ∗ (f ), semi-analytical
expressions [109–112] or numerical methods [113, 114]
were usually used. Recently, a fully analytical expression
of Michelson type TDI combinations has been derived
[115–119], which provides a convenient way to calculate
the response, and is adopted in this paper.

The analytic response function for each channel are
shown in Fig. 2. Compared with the A/E channel, the
response of the T channel is negligible for frequencies
below the characteristic frequency (f TQ
∗ ≈ 0.28 Hz), but
needs to be considered at high frequencies.

For a given spectrum of SGWB, it is useful to deﬁne
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is dependant on
the adopted detection method. Under the null channel
method, for a SGWB with spectrum Sh(f ), the SNR is:

where Ttot is the total observation time, [fmin, fmax] is
the detection frequency band of the detector [74]. For the
assumed three representitive cases, the SNR are roughly
17, 22, and 9 for power-law, ﬂat, and Gaussian-bump
models, respectively.

IV. SEARCH METHOD AND RESULTS

in the community of astronomy, which fomulate a way to
assess the probability distribution p((cid:126)θ|D) over parameter
space (cid:126)θ with the observed data D. The core of Bayesian

function can be expressed as [2, 53]

C. Data simulation

In our simulations, we focus on a simpliﬁed scenario

and work under the following assumptions:

(1) Our data are the sum of a SGWB and instrumen-
tal noise, i.e., we are working with ideal case, that
all resolvable sources, glitches, and any other dis-
turbances have been subtracted perfectly from the
data.

(2) The noise and the signal are Gaussian, station-
ary, and uncorrelated in frequency domain. Twelve
noise components in the cross-spectra are described
by a model whose parameter values are known to
within about ±20% of its nominal values.

For the sake of convenience, we generate data directly
in the frequency domain, since this allows us to ignore
window eﬀects and overlapping segments. We generate
a three-month data set at 5 second sampling interval,
which is related by a maximum frequency of 0.1 Hz. The
correlated noise are generated by

nA(fk) =

(x1 + i y1),

nE(fk) = c1 nA(fk) + c2 (x2 + i y2),
nT (fk) = c3 nA(fk) + c4 nE(fk) + c5 (x3 + i y3). (26)

Likewise, independent signals for each channel can there-
fore be generated by

D. Parameter estimation

The formalism of Eq. (24) means that we can assess
the noise parameters from the data. In this subsection,
we use TQSGWB to perform Bayesian inference on the GW
data under various models, and discuss the ability of as-
sessing the position noise Sp
ij and acceleration noise Sa
ij.
We ﬁrst investigate the scenario where the data is com-
posed with noise only.

In this scenario, we compare parameter estimation re-
sults under two diﬀerent covariance matrix: with and
without the imaginary components. We show the corner
plots of posterior in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, corresponding
to the real and complex covariance matrix respectively.
In Fig. 3, we present the sum (Siji ≡ Sij + Sji) and
diﬀerence (DSiji ≡ Sij − Sji) for each arm, both for the
position noise and for the acceleration noise. We indicate
the injected values with blue lines, and the 68% and 95%
credible regions with contour lines.

As expected, all summation parameters Siji are well
constrained, with slight negative correlation between dif-
ferent summations. The latter can be explained by the
expression in Appendix A, which shows that for the di-
agonal terms (for both the position noises and the ac-
celeration noises) all Siji adds up, leading to a negative
correlation in between. On the other hand, the diﬀer-
ence parameters DSiji are much less constrained. The
corner plot shows almost no constraining ability at all
for DSp
iji, as there’s no such term in the real components
of the covariance matrix. The situation is slightly better
for DSa
iji, since the expression is not totally degenerate,
however, it is only possible to constrain a certain com-
bination of the diﬀerences. That being said, in all cases
the injected values are all locate within the 68% credible
region, with occasional exception.

Once the imaginary components are included in the
calculation, the degeneracy in position noise can be bro-

ken.
eters Sp
ij per se, while keep the sum and diﬀerence for
the acceleration noies. As expected, each pair of position
noises are negatively correlated, while correlation exist
for other combinations. Since the imagionary correction
does not contribute to the acceleration noise, the pattern
of the contours remain roughly the same. However, bet-
ter constraining in position noise also help to constrain
the acceleration noie better. We observe that the 68%
uncertainty for the summation log10 Sa
iji is around 0.01
for Fig. 3, but shrinks to 0.003 for Fig. 4.

We then turn to the scenarios when SGWB is present
in the data. Similar to the noise-only scenario, by adopt-
ing the correct model, the injected noise parameters can
be recovered accurately. Furthermore, the SGWB pa-
rameters are also correctly recovered. This results show
the encouraging potential for the null channel method
to recover noise parameters like Sp
ij, as well as
the SGWB parameters like a, and Ω. However, for the
Gaussian-bump case, the injected value for the parame-
ter ∆ lies slightly outside the 68% credible interval. This

can be partially explained by the low SNR for the in-
jected SGWB. We present corner plots for a power-law,
a ﬂat, and a Gaussian-bump SGWB, respectively in In
Figs. 6 to 8.

E. Detection limit

We then shift attention to the Bayesian model selec-
tion. In this part, we aim to answer to which level can
we conﬁdently use TQSGWB to identify the existence of
SGWB. We consider two models

In Fig. 5, we present log Bayes factor between the
SGWB models and the noise model, with the correspond-
ing SGWB injected in the data, and a total observation
period of three months is assumed. In each panel there
are multiple horizontal lines, the green dashed line rep-
resents a log Bayes factor of 3, and the blue dashed line
represents a log Bayes factor of 5.

Our detection conﬁdence becomes very strong (a log
Bayes factor of 5) for a power-law background level
ΩPL = 1.3 × 10−12, a ﬂat background level of ΩFlat =
6.0 × 10−12, and a single peak background level ΩSP =
9.0 × 10−12 with three-month data. The corresponding
SNRs are around 5, 13, and 8, respectively.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we investigated the capability of TianQin
to detect various isotropic SGWB under the null chan-
nel method. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, for
the ﬁrst time, we include the imaginary component to
the cross-spectral TDI channels covariance matrix. We
perform a Bayesian inference under a number of diﬀerent
cases to demonstrate the validity of the updated covari-
ance matrix. We also applied a model selection analysis
to show how sensitive is the null channel method to the
strength of SGWB model. Three models are considered
for the SGWB spectrum: the CBCs (power-law), a scale
invariant inﬂationary SGWB (ﬂat), and a single peak
spectrum (Gaussian-bump). Throughout our analysis,
we have assumed the SGWB and noise to be Gaussian
and stationary, and we assume an operation time of three
months due to TianQin’s 3+3 operational model.

We have calculated the cross-spectral density of in-
strumental noise working in the TDI-1.5 channels A, E,
and T . Applying the MCMC on noise-only data, we
demonstrated that including the imaginary components
can help to break degeneracies between diﬀerent noise
parameters, especially for the position noise. Similar
conclusions are also observed when three representitive
SGWB are injected.

to demonstrate that both the noise and SGWB pa-
rameters can be recovered accurately under the correct
model

9

To assess the detection limit of the null channel method
to SGWB, we apply Bayesian model selection to the noise
and SGWB model versus the noise only model. We com-
pute the Bayes factors under diﬀerent SGWB strengths,
and concluded that TianQin will be able to detect the en-
ergy density of a PL signal as low as ΩPL = 1.3 × 10−12,
a ﬂat signal as low as ΩFlat = 6.0 × 10−12, and a SP
signal as low as ΩSP = 9.0 × 10−12 with three-month
observation.

The primary purpose of this paper is to explore the
detection capability of the SGWB via a TianQin space-
based GW observatory, and focusing on the importance
of including the imaginary component of the covariance
matrix. What’s more, the discussion here focuses on
distinguishing single-component SGWB from instrument
noise, and does not yet address issues of identifying as-
trophysical and cosmological sources simultaneously.

One line of our future study is to extend to multiple in-
dependent space-based GW detectors, such as TianQin-
LISA network. TianQin and LISA are two mHz band
space-based GW detectors which will probably ﬂy at
roughly the same time, around 2035. With this network,
one can expect to apply the cross-correlation method to
detect SGWB. Another line is to see how the limit is
aﬀected by astrophysical confusion foregrounds, such as
the noise from un-resolved white dwarf binaries in our
Galaxy. We leave those for future works.

Appendix A: Cross-Spectra

Here we provide a detailed calculation with respect to the noise cross-spectra between diﬀerent TDI channels.
Due to the absence of correlation between diﬀerent links as well as types of noise, the one-sided Gaussian spectral

density of the noise can be deﬁned as [123]:
