Analysis of the data from photoelectric gas
polarimeters

Fabio Muleri ∗

Abstract This chapter is dedicated to the description of the tools and procedures
for the analysis of the data collected by X-ray photoelectric gas polarimeters, like
the ones on-board the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). Although many
of such tools are in principle common with polarimeters working at other energy
bands, the peculiar characteristics and performance of these devices require a spe-
ciﬁc approach. We will start from the analysis of the raw data read-out from this kind
of instruments, that is, the image of the track of the photoelectron. We will brieﬂy
present how such images are processed with highly-specialized algorithms to extract
all the information collected by the instrument. These include energy, time of arrival
and, possibly, absorption point of the photon, in addition to the initial direction of
emission of the photoelectron. The last is the quantity relevant for polarimetry, and
we will present different methods to obtain the polarization degree and angle from
it. A simple method, used extensively especially during the development phase of
X-ray photoelectric gas polarimeters, is based on the construction and ﬁtting of
the azimuthal distribution of the photoelectrons. While such a method provides in
principle correct results, we will discuss that there are several reasons to prefer an
analysis based on Stokes parameters, especially when one wants to analyze mea-
surements of real, i.e., not laboratory, sources. These are quantities commonly used
at all wavelengths because they are additive, and then operations like background
subtraction or the application of calibration are trivial to apply, and they are normal
and independent variables to a large extend. We will summarize how Stokes param-
eters can be used to adapt current spectroscopy software based on forward folding
ﬁtting to perform spectro-polarimetry. Moreover, we will derive how to properly
associate the statistical uncertainty on a polarimetry measurement and the relation
with another statistical indicator, which is in the minimum detectable polarization.

2 Introduction: Photoelectric polarimeters

Photoelectric polarimeters are instruments which measure the polarization in the
X-ray energy band using the photoelectric effect. For each detected photon, the de-
tector provides an estimate of the direction of emission of the photoelectron emitted
as a consequence of the absorption of the photon. This is the quantity correlated to
the polarization of incident radiation and it is conventionally identiﬁed by means
of its azimuthal and polar angles, φ and θ, respectively (see Figure 1). The depen-
dence on polarization is expressed by the dependence on φ and θ of differential
cross section of the interaction, which is [1]:

dΩ

∝ cos2 φ

where β is the photoelectron velocity in units of the speed of light c. Equation 1
indicates that the interaction more probably occurs when the photoelectron is emit-
ted parallel to the direction of the photon electric ﬁeld, i.e., when φ is 0 or π, and
on the plane orthogonal to the incidence direction, that is, θ
0, at least at low en-
ergy, β
1. Emission is suppressed in the direction orthogonal to the electric ﬁeld
(φ = 0), which, however, holds true in exact terms only when the photon is absorbed
by an electron in a spherical shell [2]. This is usually the largely-dominant case in
the energy range of real photoelectric polarimeters and, therefore, we will assume
in the following that Equation 1 can be extended to all events.

The discussion above indicates that the information on the polarization of the
absorbed photons is contained in the azimuthal distribution of the photoelectron di-
rection of emission, and photoelectric polarimeters can measure it with different ap-
proaches. A simple approach is to relate the probability of events hitting two pixels
in ﬁnely subdivided semiconductor detectors to the emission direction of the photo-
electron (see [3] and references therein). Typically, modern devices absorb X-rays
in a gaseous medium to generate tracks with sufﬁcient length which can be resolved
in details on a 2-dimensional image, as in the device in Figure 1. Photoelectron
image can be generated with the collection of ions produced by ionization by the
photoelectron along its path [4, 5, 6, 7] or by imaging the scintillation light gener-
ated by recombination of generated ions [8]. In all cases, an algorithm is applied to
the image to estimate the absorption point of the photon and the initial direction of
the photoelectron (see Section 3). Interestingly enough, practical implementations
of photoelectric polarimeters are usually not designed to measure the polar angle of
the event. In fact this is not sensitive to polarization, albeit, in principle, it could be

ton is absorbed in the sensitive volume, typically ﬁlled with a gas mixture. The path

off-line to determine the azimuthal direction of emission ϕ which is correlated with
the electric ﬁeld direction of the absorbed photon.

useful to discard tracks which are emitted towards the detector plane (or away from
it) and then they are more difﬁcult to resolve.

It is worth noting that the angle φ in Equation 1 and the measured azimuthal
angle, indicated as ϕ in Figure 1 are in principle different: φ is the azimuthal an-
gle measured from the photoelectron electric ﬁeld on the plane orthogonal to the
incident direction, whereas ϕ is the same angle but measured on the plane of the
detector and from one of its reference axes. In the common case in which photons
are incident orthogonal (or nearly-so) to the detector, φ and ϕ simply differs of an
offset, which is the polarization angle. In the discussion to follow, we will always
implicitly assume that such a condition is satisﬁed. In the more general case of a
large-ﬁeld-of-view instrument in which photons can impinge at large angles, the
response of a photoelectric polarimeter depends not only on polarization of the in-
cident photons but also on their direction, and the analysis requires speciﬁc tools
[9].

3 Reconstruction of photoelectron track

The response of a photoelectric gas polarimeter is the 2-dimensional image of pho-
toelectron absorbed in its sensitive volume, projected on the plane of the detector
(see Figure 1). We show in Figure 2 real photoelectron images generated from X-
ray photons absorbed in one of the ﬂight Gas Pixel Detectors[4, 5, 6] built for the

4

Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE, [10, 11, 12]). Absorbed photons had
energy 2.3 keV and 6.4 keV for the events in Figure 2a and Figure 2b, respectively,
which lie close to the boundaries of the instrument energy range, which is 2-8 keV.
Photons are absorbed in the region where the track has a lower charge density, as
the photoelectron loses more and more energy as it slows down. During its path, the
photoelectron suffers scattering with atomic nuclei in the absorbing medium which
tend to cancel the information on its initial direction of emission.

As expected, high-energy photons generate longer tracks, which are easier to re-
solve and shows richer details, whereas the features in low-energy tracks are barely
visible. Nonetheless, effective area of X-ray instruments and spectra of astrophysi-
cal sources decrease quickly with energy, and, as a matter of fact, peak of sensitiv-
ity of photoelectric polarimeters is usually close to the low-energy boundary. The
ﬁrst challenge in the analysis of data from photoelectric polarimeter is therefore
to design an algorithm able to estimate the initial direction of the photoelectron,
especially when its image shows just a few details.

Different approaches have been put forward to reconstruct photoelectron tracks.
The simplest is a custom algorithm originally developed for the GPD [13], which is
based on the calculation of momenta of photoelectron image after that a clustering
algorithm is used to separate the track from noise [12]. The barycenter of the charge
distribution provides the estimate of the absorption point, and the direction that min-
imize the second momentum is the direction of the photoelectron. Especially at high
energy, when the photoelectron track is longer, it is convenient to repeat the algo-
rithm on the initial part of the track only, which is distinguished as the end with

Analysis of the data from photoelectric gas polarimeters

lower charge density. An alternative, which is particularly effective when the track
has rich features, is to use more complicate techniques, such as the shortest path
problem in graph theory [14] or convolutional neural networks [15, 16].

The capability of measuring the absorption point of the photon provides to pho-
toelectric polarimeters imaging capabilities. Moreover, the total charge in the pho-
toelectron is proportional to the energy of the absorbed photon. Using the trigger of
the event to measure the time of arrival, a photoelectric polarimeter can therefore
measure all the information transported by the radiation.

4 A simple analysis with the modulation curve

The number of photoelectron emitted per azimuthal angle is expected to be anisotropic
when absorbed photons are polarized. The signature is speciﬁcally a cosine square
modulation, remindful of φ-dependence of differential cross section (see Equa-
tion 1), with amplitude proportional to the polarization degree and with a maxi-
mum in the direction of the polarization angle. To evaluate it, a simple procedure is
to build the histogram of the reconstructed photoelectron emission angles with M
bins, named modulation curve (see Figure 3), and ﬁt it with the function2:

M (ϕ) = A + B cos2(ϕ

ϕ0).

(2)

−

In absence of background, the polarization degree P is deﬁned as the ratio be-
tween the ﬂux of the polarized component with respect to the total. The ﬁrst term
is causing the observed modulation in the modulation curve, and therefore P is
proportional to the measured modulation amplitude a:

(4)

The modulation factor of a polarimeter accounts for the fact that real detectors can
not provide a perfect reconstruction of the event, that is, the direction of emission
of the photoelectron is reconstructed with a certain uncertainty. As the quality of
the photoelectron track changes with energy, also the modulation factor does. It can
be obtained from detailed simulations or accurate measurements, the latter being

as a function of the azimuthal direction.

necessary for a fully representative result. The polarization angle is the value ϕ0
obtained by the ﬁt with Equation 3, which is deﬁned modulo its period π.

5 The Minimum Detectable Polarization

When the procedure described in the previous section is applied to a modulation
curve measured in case of unpolarized photon, the result is always the detection of
a certain modulation amplitude, albeit small (see Figure 4). This is caused by the
fact that the number of detected photons in a certain bin of the modulation curve
is Poisson-distributed, and the independent statistical ﬂuctuations among different
bins always cause to detect a cosine-square modulation. The amplitude of such a
component is to all extent the statistical limit of the measurement. This is quantiﬁed
introducing the Minimum Detectable Polarization (MDP), which is deﬁned as the
maximum polarization which can be produced by statistical ﬂuctuations only in
absence of true source polarization, at a certain conﬁdence level C = 99%. The
MDP depends on the number of source (and background) events, that is, on the
instrument effective area, and on the modulation factor. Therefore, the MDP is also
a meter of the detector sensitivity, and, once referred to an observation of reference
source for a speciﬁc duration, it can be used to compare the sensitivity of different
experiments.

The value of the MDP for a certain observation for which N events are collected
can be derived by the probability P of measuring a certain polarization P in case

which is the well-know expression in case the background is negligible. Incidentally,
this result quantiﬁes the claim that polarimetry is a ”photon-hungry” technique. To
achieve, with an instrument with average modulation factor 30%, an MDP of 1%,
that is, smaller than the polarization expected from many astrophyiscal sources, one

needs to collect

It is worth stressing that Equation 8 is valid when the background contribution is
known, intending its expected modulation amplitude and phase. In this case, even
if the background can be removed from the measurement, its statistical ﬂuctuations
still limits the achievable MDP.

6 Stokes parameters

The approach presented in Section 4 has the advantage to be simple and close to
the underlying physics of the detector, and to provide directly the polarization de-
gree and angle, which are the physical observables which one is usually interested
in. However, it shows limitations in practice, for example it is not trivial to subtract
a background or apply the calibration of the detector with proper statistical treat-
ment. Manipulation of the measured signal can be easily achieved by using Stokes
parameters.

Stokes parameters are a 4-dimension vector, usually indicated with (I, Q,U,V ),
which is used to completely describe the state of polarization of radiation, intending
both its linear and circular polarization and its intensity [19]. Their use has been
common especially at wavelengths longer than X-rays, but as we will see Stokes
parameters are adequate and convenient also to describe polarization at higher en-
ergy.

There are several equivalent ways to deﬁne Stokes parameters, each ﬁtting better
with the measurement procedure in a speciﬁc energy range. For example, in optical
light or infrared, the intensity of radiation component polarized in a certain direc-
tion, e.g. at I0 at 0◦, I90 at 90◦, can be easily measured as it is for right and left
circularly polarized components, Irc and Ilc. Then, Stokes parameters are deﬁned as

In radio, one measures the amplitude Ex and Ey of the wave in orthogonal direc-
tions as a function of time, and operations like correlation (and conjugation) of the
signal are readily available. In this case, Stokes parameters are usually deﬁned as
[19]:

I = ExE ∗x + EyE ∗y

U = ExE ∗y + EyE ∗x

where the line indicates the averaged value over time.

In the X-ray energy range, current implementations of polarimeters are not sen-
sitive to circular polarization and in fact only I, Q and U can be measured and will
be discussed hereafter. A method to calculate them is ﬁtting the modulation curve
with a function depending explicitly on Stokes parameters[20]3:

M (ϕ) = I + Q cos2ϕ+ U sin 2ϕ.

(9)

An alternative approach consists in calculating the Stokes parameters for each
event (ik, qk, uk) [21]. If ϕk is the (reconstructed) emission angle of the k-th photo-
electron 4:

ik = 1
qk = 2 cos 2ϕk
uk = 2 sin 2ϕk




.

(10)



From this deﬁnition, it follows that Stokes parameters qk and uk are the abscissa
and the ordinate of a vector with length 2 and forming an angle 2ϕk with the x-axis.
Although it is more common at other wavelengths to deﬁne them as vector with
unit length, the factor 2 takes into account the peculiar cos2 distribution of events
observed with X-ray instrumentation and we will adopt it in the following.

Stokes parameters for a measurement are obtained by summing event Stokes

parameters over the entire data set:

3 In our deﬁnition we inverted Q and U with respect to the the original paper [20] for consistency
with the usual formulae to derive polarization at other wavelengths.

(compare our Equation 20 to Equation 9 in [21]). Although this makes Stokes parameters Q and U

Stokes parameters can at any moment be converted to (linear) polarization degree
and angle (and vice versa). However, the usual formulae applicable at all wave-
lengths must be modiﬁed to account for the modulation factor of the instrument,
which is a peculiarity of X-ray polarimeters:

where q = Q/I and u = U/I are normalized Stokes parameters.

It is worth noting that event-by-event calculation of Stokes parameter does not
provides expected values identical to those obtained by ﬁtting with the function
M (ϕ) in Equation 9; in fact, the obtained values are proportional, the constant of
proportionality being the number of bins in the modulation curve, M. Neverthe-
less, the two approaches are completely equivalent as the observable quantities are
the polarization degree and angle, which are invariant for proportional Stokes pa-
rameters. In the following, we will assume to determine Stokes parameters with the
event-by-event approach, and to use normalized Stokes parameters when convenient
to make the measured value independent on the number of collected events.

We also stress that the normalization by the modulation factor is typically done
when calculating the polarization degree with Equation 12, but one can equivalently
deﬁne µ-normalized Stokes parameters:

We will not develop further this possibility in the following, sticking to the more
conventional deﬁnition given in Equation 11. However, the interested reader can
easily derive the formulae discussed below in the former assumption.

7 Properties of Stokes parameters

The use of Stokes parameters with respect that the approach described in Section 4
has several advantages. While P (or a) and φ0 are dependent, Stokes parameters
can be considered normal and independent variables if a large number of events are
collected and the measured modulation is small [20, 21]. Both of these conditions
are satisﬁed in practice for all observations of astrophysical sources carried out with
photoelectric polarimeters and their validity will be adopted hereafter. In such an

(15)

Stokes parameters are additive. In case the observation is affected by a sig-
niﬁcant background, it is trivial to subtract it once that its Stokes parameters
(Ibkg, Qbkg,Ubkg) are known. The ﬁrst step is to re-scale the background Stokes pa-
rameters, assumed to be measured with an observation with duration Tbkg, to the
duration of the observation Tobs. Then, if (I, Q,U) is measured for the observation
and η = Tobs

(17)

Additivity of Stokes parameters is handy also to apply calibration. While the
response of an ideal instrument is, apart from statistical ﬂuctuations of the signal,
azimuthally uniform, real devices may present a signal also in case of unpolarized
radiation. The second armonic of such a signal, which has a period of 180◦, is usu-
ally referred to as spurious modulation and it has the same signature as the signal
generated by a genuine polarization. Therefore, spurious modulation has to be sub-
tracted from data to obtain the true source polarization.

The amplitude and phase of spurious modulation can be measured with accurate
calibration measurements, or, if possible, derived from simulations. As the modula-
tion genuinely produced by polarization, spurious modulation can be expressed with
Stokes parameters, (Ism, Qsm,Usm), and as such subtracted from measured values as
a background. One has only to assume η = 1 in Equations 16.

A notable case is when spurious modulation is dependent on photon energy and
absorption point. In this case, a convenient approach is to subtract event-by-event
spurious modulation so that the subsequent analysis can proceed essentially as for
an ideal detector [23]. The ﬁrst step is to use calibrations (or simulations) to gen-
erate maps of normalized Stokes parameters of spurious modulation at different
energies, (qsm, usm). The maps are then interpolated to ﬁnd the estimate of the spu-

it is for qk and uk. Practical effect is that, from them, it is not possible to properly

be shown that, when summed over a data set, the expected value of the corrected

Event-by-event Stokes parameters allow to introduce weights in the analysis.
These are intended to increase the importance of those tracks which can be recon-
structed with a smaller uncertainty because of the better quality of the photoelectron
image. Depending on the algorithm used, different parameters can be used to quan-
tify the quality of the track. It can be shown that the best weight is proportional to
the modulation factor, and topological properties of the charge distribution or the
output of convolutional neural networks have been used [24, 16, 25].

Weights are introduced in the event-by-event analysis with a simple modiﬁcation

The effect of weights is to increase the modulation factor, at the expense of a
reduction of the ”effective” number of events used in the analysis. The latter effect
can be quantiﬁed with the introduction of the quantity:

8 Spectro-polarimetry with Stokes parameters and

forward-folding

Deﬁnition and additive property make Stokes parameters essentially ﬂux quantites.
I is the source ﬂux, while Q and U encode, in addition to source ﬂux, the polariza-
tion angle and degree of the source. As these three quantities completely describe
the source emission and they are dependent, it is highly desirable that their analysis
is carried out simultaneously. [26] deﬁned a simple method to extend the common
tools developed for X-ray spectroscopy, applicable to I, to include also linear po-
larization represented by Q and U. This provides a standardized way of performing
spettro-polarimetry and we will review the results in the following.

Spectral analysis is often carried out with software, like XSPEC [27], which
adopts a procedure named forward folding. This consists in modeling the source
spectrum from the measured one with the known response of the instrument. The
ﬁrst step is to deﬁne an input model with certain start parameters. Instrument re-
sponse functions are used to calculate what the measured spectrum would be in case
the source had the assumed model. The process is iterated to ﬁnd the input model
parameters which minimize the difference between the calculated and measured
spectra with a procedure such as χ2 ﬁtting.

The response function used for spectral analysis comprises the effective area
ε(E) of the instrument, which is its collecting area, and the redistribution matrix
R(E0, E). The latter expresses the probability that a photon with energy E is recon-
structed with an energy E0. To handle polarization, an additional quantity has to be
introduced which accounts for the probability that a photon with a certain polariza-
tion is measured with a different one. It can be shown [26] that such a probability is
related to the amplitude of the instrumental response to polarization and, ultimately,
it is the modulation factor µ(E) of the instrument. The underlying assumption is that
the polarimetric response is independent on the effective area and energy dispersion,
which is typically veriﬁed for real instruments, and that it does not depend on the
polarization degree or angle of the source. The last assumption holds true when the
response of the instrument can be treated as ideal, that is, spurious modulation, if
present, is subtracted with a method such as that described above.

The effective area, the redistribution matrix and the modulation factor are all the
response functions which are needed to perform the forward folding procedure with
spectro-polarimetric data. In fact, in case the model Stokes parameters are I , Q
and U , the observed Stokes parameters I, Q and U over a certain energy bin can be
calculated with:

I =
E′
Q =

U =

I (E) ε(E ′) R(E ′, E)dE ′

U (E) µ(E ′) ε(E ′) R(E ′, E)dE ′

It is worth stressing that in this approach the analysis of Q and U requires “only”
ε(E ′) instead of the canonical ε(E ′) commonly
to use a response function µ(E ′)
used for I by current software for spectral ﬁtting. This is a relatively small change
in the analysis ﬂow and, needless to say, a great advantage when one wants to use
the power of spectral analysis together with polarization.

9 Polarization and its statistical uncertainty

Visualization of the result of a polarization measurement with proper uncertainties
can be done in different ways. A ﬁrst option is to use Stokes parameters, which in
this case it is convenient to normalize for both I and the modulation factor µ, to
have a result directly expressed in polarization and not in amplitude. An example
is reported in Figure 6. Measured values are q0 = 4% and u0 = 4% which, once
normalized by µ (assumed to be 0.3), translate in the coordinates ( 4
0.3 ). The
1-σ uncertainty on either q or u is σq = σu = 1
2
N , which is Equation 15 but
µ
normalized by the modulation factor. The measured polarization degree P0 is the
radius of the measured point from the origin, while the polarization angle is half
of the angle that the radius forms with the abscissa. Circles with different radii and
centered in the axis origin represent constant polarization values and also the MDP
can be represented as a circle.

0.3 , 4

q

It is worth stressing here once more the meaning (and difference) between the
MDP and the error on the measurement. The former quantity is a very simple statis-
tical quantity, which expresses the maximum polarization that the user should expect
to measure (at a conﬁdence level of 99%) because of statistical ﬂuctuations in the
assumption that the source was not polarized. If the measured value is larger than
the MDP, this means that there is a probability smaller than 1% that such a value
would be measured in case the source was unpolarized, and then the user can claim
that the source is polarized at this conﬁdence level. On the contrary, if the measured
value is below the MDP, there is a high chance that the user obtained that value
only because of statistical ﬂuctuations and not because the source was genuinely
polarized.

Error on the measurement has a completely different meaning. It expresses how
large is the interval in which the true value lies, and then it can be used to compare

the measured value with respect to, e.g., a model prediction. So, to be credible,
the measured value must be higher than the MDP and the error on the measurement
must not include the space region in which the polarization is zero, that is, the origin
of axis in Figure 6. Clearly, these two requirements are interdependent, as both
depend essentially on the number of collected counts and the modulation factor, and
they should provide a coherent indication on the credibility of the detection.

There are cases in which it is more convenient to plot polarization degree and
angle instead of Stokes parameters. In this case, one has to remember that these two
parameters are dependent to properly derive the statistical uncertainty on the mea-
surement. To derive the conﬁdence region of a measurement in the (P,ϕ) plane,
we start from the assumption that Stokes parameters are normally distributed and
independent. As we discussed in Section 6, this holds true when the µP
1. In
this assumption, the probability distribution function when the measured value is
(q0, u0) is a bivariate normal distribution [21]:

where, for uniformity of our notation, Stokes parameters are normalized by I but
not by the modulation factor, and then we will have to normalize by µ when passing
from Stokes parameters to polarization.

By deﬁnition, the statistical uncertainty at a certain conﬁdence level C is the

region such that, integrating over it, we obtain C:

Now, we have to ﬁnd a convenient way to express P(N, P
P0,ϕ0) and its inte-
gration interval. First of all, we note that the argument of the exponent of P de-
ﬁned in Equation 25 is the distance between the measured point with coordinate
(q0, u0) and the generic point on the plane (q, u). Recalling Equation 12 and that
σ = σq = σu =

The integration interval is trivial to deﬁne in the (q, u) plane, as it is a circle with
center the measured point(q0, u0) and radius µδP . Such a region is more easy to
integrate if we pass from variables (q, u) to (δP ,ψ) (see Figure 7). Then:

q = q0 + µδP cosψ
u = u0 + µδP sinψ ⇒

We have now completely characterized the conﬁdence region in the (q, u) plane

Equation 32 is the system of parametric functions, with variable ψ, which de-
scribes the region on the (P,ϕ) plane at a conﬁdence level C, which determines
the value δmax together with the number of collected counts N. Such a region is
plotted in Figure 8 for a conﬁdence level of 68.3% for a decreasing signiﬁcance of
the measurement. While the region is essentially elliptical when the measurement
has a high signal-to-noise (S/N), its contour tends to elongate when the S/N is low
and all angles are possible when the measurement is not signiﬁcant.

The maximum and minimum values of the polarization degree and angle inside
the contour are the boundaries over which they vary at the selected conﬁdence level.
It is useful to calculate them when C = 68.3%, as this is the statistical uncertainty
usually quoted with the measurement. For P the calculation is trivial, as it varies in
the interval [P0

δmax, P0 + δmax] as ψ varies and then:

There is another possible approach to derive the statistical uncertainty on a po-
larization measurement, which is to simply propagate statistical uncertainty on the
measured Stokes parameters. Using Equations 12 and 13, 1-σ uncertainty propa-
gated in this way reads [20]:

where we neglected the uncertainties on I or on µ, as they are supposed to be much
smaller that σq or σu, and we used the superscript “1-D” to distinguish the values
found with this approach from the ones in Equation 33 and 35. It is important to
stress that this procedure does assume that P and ϕ are independent variables,
which are not. Therefore, the uncertainty calculated in this ways has a different
meaning with the respect to the value calculated above, even if in both cases we
assumed a conﬁdence level of 68.3%. Equation 33 and 35 provide the combined
interval for both the polarization degree, that is, we can say that our measurement
constrained the polarization degree in the interval P0
σP and the polarization
σϕ. On the contrary, 1-D uncertainties provide such an interval for
angle in ϕ0
only one of them, leaving the other one unconstrained [20]. Then, one can say that
polarization has a 1-σ uncertainty equal to σ1D
P , but as the polarization varies in
such an interval the polarization angle is left unconstrained.

±

±

1-D uncertainties are shown together with “combined” ones in Figure 8. If we
compare Equations 33 and 37, 1-D uncertainty on polarization degree is nearly 40%
smaller than the corresponding “combined” one. This is true also for the polariza-
tion angle, as in both approaches the uncertainty on ϕ is approximately proportional
to σP . While the decision to use combined or 1-D uncertainties should taken on a
case-by-case basis, when one wants to use the full potential of polarization measure-
ment, that is, use both the constrain on polarization degree and angle, the appropriate
statistical approach is the combined one.

10 Conclusions

In this chapter we have presented how a polarization measurement obtained with a
photoelectric polarimeter is processed to derive the polarization degree and angle.
Starting from the analysis of the raw data provided by this kind of instrument, that
is, the image of the track of the photoelectron in a medium, we discussed different
methods to derive the measured value and its statistical uncertainty, and to evaluate
the credibility of the measurement.

The intent was to collect in a single reference the basic information that a user
needs to know to use data acquired with photoelectric polarimeters. This is timely,

20

as the interest on this topic is rapidly increasing: at the time of writing, the Imaging
X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) has been just launched and it is expected to de-
tect polarization from tens of sources of different classes. Before IXPE, PolarLight,
which is a cubesat based on the same photoelectric polarimeter on-board IXPE, has
already provided fresh data [28]. In the next future, the enhanced X-ray Timing and
Polarimetry mission [29] will expand IXPE results with a larger collecting area and
simultaneous spectral and timing observation.

All these opportunities have renewed the interest in the development of data anal-
ysis tools, which, however, are still discussed in speciﬁc research papers. Here we
tried to collect and present the results with a uniform notation and approach, typ-
ically preferring a simpliﬁed (and easier to follow) approach to a more rigorous
treatment. The interested reader can ﬁnd the latter in the original papers cited in the
text.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the discussion presented here is largely shaped
on the analysis tools developed for the IXPE mission. In fact, IXPE has been the
ﬁrst mission for which a complete set of analysis tools had to be distributed for
the general user, and this has pushed the team to explore and tackle all the issue
along the path, from data reduction to statistical treatment of the measurement. At
the same time, IXPE example also guided the approximations done throughout this
chapter, which are typically adequate for the analysis at its level of sensitivity.
