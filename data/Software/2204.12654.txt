ABSTRACT 

The United States  of America has been  the  worst affected  country  in  terms  of  the 
number  of  cases  and  deaths  on  account  of  the  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19, a highly transmissible and pathogenic 
coronavirus that started spreading globally in late 2019. On account of the surge of 
infections, accompanied by hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19, and lack 
of a definitive cure at that point, a national emergency was declared in the United 
States  on  March  13,  2020.  To  prevent  the  rapid  spread  of  the  virus,  several  states 
declared stay at home and remote work guidelines shortly after this declaration of an 
emergency. Such guidelines caused schools, colleges, and universities, both private 
and public, in all the 50-United States to switch to remote or online forms of teaching 
for  a  significant  period  of  time.  As  a  result,  Google,  the  most  widely  used  search 
engine  in  the  United  States,  experienced  a  surge  in  online  shopping  of  remote 
learning-based  software,  systems,  applications,  and  gadgets  by  both  educators  and 
students from all the 50-United States, due to both these groups responding to the 
associated needs and demands related to switching to remote teaching and learning. 
This paper aims to investigate, analyze, and interpret these trends of Google Shopping 
related to remote learning that emerged since March 13, 2020, on account of COVID-

19 and the subsequent remote learning adoption in almost all schools, colleges, and 
universities, from all the 50-United States. The study was performed using Google 
Trends,  which  helps  to  track  and  study  Google  Shopping-based  online  activity 
emerging  from  different  geolocations.  The  results  and  discussions  show  that  the 
highest  interest  related  to  Remote  Learning-based  Google  Shopping  was  recorded 
from  Oregon,  which  was  followed  by  Illinois,  Florida,  Texas,  California,  and  the 
other states.

INTRODUCTION 

Throughout the last decade (Palvia et al. 2018), but more specifically within the last 
two years (Moshinski et al. 2021, Moore et al. 2011), society has become far more 
dependent  on  remote  and  online  learning  technologies  for  their  ability  to  create 
flexible,  seamless,  and  interconnected  environments  for  sharing,  exchange, 
communication,  and  delivery  of  knowledge  and  information.  Online  learning  or 
remote learning, a newer and improved version of distance learning, may broadly be 
defined as a means of learning that is characterized by the involvement of one or more 
forms of technology that improves access and availability to educational resources 
and opportunities for both the learners and the educators  (Moore et al. 2011). The 
recent worldwide emergence of remote learning has been a result of the multitude of 
advantages that it provides over the traditional approaches of learning. Some of these 
advantages (James 2021, Zain 2021) include – (1) ease of access, (2) affordability, 
(3) seamless collaborations from different geographic regions, (4) time saving, and 
(5) low maintenance cost. The adoption of online learning on a global scale increased 
at a rate as never seen before over the last couple of years amidst the new normal 
created by the COVID-19 pandemic (Peimani et al. 2021).  

The  2019  Novel  Coronavirus  (COVID-19),  a  form  of  coronavirus  that  causes 
respiratory illness of varying degrees in humans, had an outbreak in a seafood and 
ani-mal market in Wuhan, China, in 2019 (HamiltoncountyhealthOrg 2020). Since 
then, the virus, characterized by its abilities to mutate and spread rapidly, has affected 
every  country  across  the  world,  resulting  in  infections,  critical  illness  conditions, 
hospitalizations, and deaths of the order that the world has not seen in a very long 
time. At the time of writing this pa-per, on a global scale, there have been a total of 
infections  and  5,018,830  deaths  on  account  of  COVID-19 
247,750,105 
(WorldometersInfo 2021). The World Health Organization has declared this virus as 
a "pandemic" (WHO 2021), and out of all the countries, the United States has been 
the  worst hit in  terms  of  the  number  of  infections  and deaths, with  these  numbers 
being 46,864,720 and 766,711, respectively (WorldometersInfo 2021). The COVID-
19  virus  start-ed  spreading  in  the  United  States  in  late  2019,  and  its  spread  was 
characterized  by  infections,  hospitalizations,  urgent  care  treatments,  and  deaths  in

magnitudes that the United States economy has never had to deal with in almost about 
a century (Xiu et al. 2021). As a response to the situation, the United States declared 
a  state  of  national  emergency  on  March  13,  2020  (WhitehouseGov  2021).  The 
declaration  of  national  emergency  was  accompanied  by  the  guidelines  from  the 
Center for Disease Control (C.D.C.) to work from home to reduce the spread of the 
virus. Following these guidelines, schools, colleges, and universities, both private and 
public, across the United States either shut down or switched to remote or distance 
learning (CDC 2021). In Fall 2019, there were 7,313,623 students enrolled in one or 
more distance education courses at degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the 
United States (NCES 2021), and by 2020, 98% of the universities in the United States 
switched  to  online  mode  of  instruction  (ThinkimpactCom  2021).  With  the  fast 
transition to remote learning, there was a surge of online shopping for remote learning 
software, systems, applications, and materials (Kur et al. 2021) that were needed to 
make the remote learning environments as effective and hands-on as possible for both 
students and educators.  

According to (ThinkimpactCom 2021), since the beginning of the pandemic, 80% of 
the  schools  in  the  United  States  have  purchased  or  are  preparing  to  purchase 
additional technology for students. Students across the United States faced multiple 
issues adapting to completely online forms of education as per this new norm. One of 
the  largest  issues  was  that  many  students  did  not  have  access  to  the  internet  or  a 
computer  at  home.  According  to  (Morgan  2020),  around  25%  of  youth  from 
households that had an annual income of less than $30,000 did not have access to a 
computer at home. This issue created a larger gap in the equality of information and 
learning  that students  received  both  in  the  same  school  as  well  as  across  different 
schools in the same state. The cities and metropolitans simply could not keep up with 
the demand for remote learning technologies. In a study, it was found that 22% of 
families incurred financial costs to support remote learning, and the majority of those 
families were already dealing with lower/lack of income due to COVID-19 (Becker 
et al. 2020). With the increase of financial costs rising for online learning, it was also 
found that only 59% of school services that were being received before the pandemic 
were maintained throughout the online learning process, which increased the need for 
cheaper  and  more  accessible  remote  learning  methods  (Becker  et  al.  2020).  These 
needs  and  demands  across  different  states  in  the  United  States  resulted  in  more 
searches on Google than ever before related to the purchase of both new and used 
technologies,  applications,  products,  and  programs  related  to  remote  learning. 
Studying, investigating, and analyzing such web behavior data on Google is expected 
to provide insight on the trends of adoption of remote learning in different states of 
the  United  States  due  to  COVID-19.  Such  an  analysis  is  also  expected  to  provide 
insight into the degree of success of switching to online learning during the COVID-
19  pandemic  across  the  United  States.  Investigating  this  research  challenge  by 
exploring the intersections of Big Data, Natural Language Processing, Information 
Retrieval,  Data  Science,  and  Human-Computer  Interaction  serves  as  the  main 
motivation for this work.

LITERATURE REVIEW 

The  COVID‐ 19  pandemic  has  resulted  in  a  seismic  shift  in  the  world  of  online 
education. The Education Sector of the United States, much like all other countries 
of the world, is still dealing with this crisis (Ronkowitz et al. 2021). Before COVID-
19,  two  previous  epidemics  occurred  in  the  20th  and  21st  centuries  in  the  United 
States, during which the education sector was impacted: the 1918 pandemic flu and 
the 2009 outbreak of H1N1 (swine flu). The average student population in schools 
and universities was lower during these two pandemics (Crocker 2021). Classes could 
be  properly  restructured  and  expanded  to  include  distant  learning  even  if  students 
choose to isolate themselves on campus. The morale of the people also played a role 
in 1918 during the outbreak of the flu (Cozens 2020).  

An overwhelming majority of the population was engaged in providing various forms 
of service to World War I at the time. The sacrifices of a majority of the population 
were  greater  than  the  sacrifices  made  by  others  whose  education  was  impeded. 
Recently,  a  number  of  studies  have  attempted  to  determine  the  most  important 
considerations and best practices that contribute to the acceptability, assimilation, and 
success of online education (Asgari 2021) as the switch to online education has been 
on a wide scale in almost all countries and geographic regions of the world on account 
of  COVID-19.  These  factors  included  course  design,  course  content  support, 
instructor's  characteristics,  and  students'  familiarity  with  and  access  to  technical 
resources.  Faculty  and  students  at  academic  institutions  in  different  geographic 
regions of the world, specifically the United States, that were primarily focused on 
conventional face-to-face education faced several problems as a result of the rapid 
transition to online training, which was prompted by the rapid surge of COVID-19 
(Almaiah et al. 2019, Al-Gahtani et al. 2016, Almaiah 2020). There was a growing 
amount of research on the educational consequences of COVID-19 as the outbreak 
progressed in different states. In June 2020, a team of researchers (Saw et al. 2020, 
Saw et al. 2020) performed a countrywide survey of STEM professors and students 
in the United States to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the education system. 
According to their research, 35.5% of doctorate students, 18% of master's students, 
and 7.6% of undergraduate students missed their graduation due to COVID-19. In 
addition  to  challenges  centered  around  graduation,  students  and  professors  in  the 
United  States  experienced  a  multitude  of  diverse  problems  and  worries  as  they 
considered whether and how to continue or not continue online education in light of 
the surge in COVID-19 cases, as reported in several blogs posts, editorials, and short 
reports  (EducauseEdu  2021,  HomonymCa  2020,  InsidehigheredCom  2021)  during 
the  initial  months  of  the  outbreak.  Topics  included  how  to  deal  with  inequalities, 
needs, how  to teach  online, how  to  share faculty  and  student  experiences,  and  the 
long- and short-term consequences for institutions (Forbes Magazine 2020, Harv Bus 
Rev 2020). These blog posts, editorials, and short reports have prompted researchers 
in the last few months to perform comprehensive studies on these problems and the 
associated needs faced by the students, professors, and institutions in different regions 
of the United States (Nguyen et al. 2020, Quezada et al. 2020. Iyer et al. 2020. Mercier 

Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics International Human Interaction & Emerging Technologies (IHIET-AI 2022) Artificial Intelligence & Future Applications https://openaccess.cms-conferences.org/#/publications/book/978-1-7923-8989-4 
 
et al. 2021. Basilaia et al. 2021).  

All these works indicate a similar trend of needs centered around familiarization with 
online learning or re-mote learning-based tools, applications, and products expressed 
by students, professors, and institutions from different states and regions of the United 
States. However, there has not been any prior work conducted in this field thus far 
that attempts to investigate, analyze, interpret, and quantify such needs and the trends 
in the same across different regions in the United States on account of COVID-19. 
Therefore, this work aims to address this knowledge gap in this field of research. 

PROPOSED APPROACH 

We performed this study using Google Trends  (Google 2020). Google Trends is a 
platform by Google that allows the web mining of search interests related to a specific 
set  of  keywords  by  performing  semantic  analysis  of  relevant  search  queries  on 
Google. These results can be mined at a global scale as well as they can be filtered 
down at a country, state, and city level. Google Trends also provides multiple ways 
to filter the search interest data, which includes location, time period, search category 
type, and type of search - such as an image search, news search, etc. With Google 
Trends,  one  can  also  compare  search  results  from  multiple  searches  to  look  at 
common  occurrences,  and  differences  within  the  information  pulled  from  the 
associated Google searches. This helps further analyze the data to better comprehend 
the larger picture and what the actual data fully represents in the grand scheme of the 
project. Google Trends uses a scale from 0 to 100 to represent this popularity in terms 
of search interests. This numerical value represents a weighted result based on the 
topic's pro-portion to all searches on all topics recorded on Google (Google Trends 
2020). The number from 0 to 100 is determined by dividing the data point by the total 
searches of the area and the time period that it represents so that the algorithm is able 
to compare the relative popularity of the search terms and assign it an appropriate 
number in this scale. Figure 1 shows a screenshot from the Google Trends website 
with the implementation of the proposed approach. As shown in Figure 1, we entered 
the keywords as "remote learning", selected "Google Shopping" to filter out all those 
search results on Google which dealt with shopping activities, the region as "United 
States",  and  duration  as  "03/13/2020  –  10/21/2021".  Here,  March  13,  2020,  was 
selected  as  the  start  date  for  this  study  as  the  national  emergency  on  account  of 
COVID-19 was declared on this day in the United States. The end date for this study 
was selected as the date on which this study was performed to accommodate for the 
maximum amount of Google Shopping-based Big Data that was available on Google 
since the declaration of the emergency.

approach along with the keywords and the other specifications of the study. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 

The above methodology provided our results in terms of search interest values in the 
context of Google Shopping-based web behavior data on a scale of 0-100 for the time 
period of March 13, 2020, to October 21, 2021, for all the states across the United 
States. For each state, the search interest value was normalized to fall within the 0-
100 scale by Google Trends, as explained in Section 3. States from which a significant 
amount of relevant search interests were not recorded were assigned a 0 value on this 
scale. Figure 2 shows the ranking of the states from which significant relevant search 
interest values were recorded in the above-mentioned time period. As can be seen 
from Figure 2, Oregon recorded the highest search interest value, which was followed 
by Illinois, Florida, Texas, California, and the other states. These trends reflect the 
Google  Shopping-based  behavior  related  to  the  purchase  of  online  learning-based 
technologies,  applications,  products,  and  programs  originating  from  each  of  these 
states. The numerical values represent the magnitude of user interest which helps us 
to potentially conclude that the maximum Google Shopping-based behavior related 
to  the  purchase  of  online  learning-based  technologies,  applications,  products,  and 
programs has been observed in Oregon so far since the out-break of COVID-19 in the 
United States. In addition to directly reflecting the potential sales, these results can 
also  be  interpreted  to  study  the  associated  market  potential,  sales  outlook,  and 
consumer perspectives of online learning-based technologies, applications, products, 
and programs in different states across the United States.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 

The declaration of national emergency on March 13, 2020, in the United States to 
reduce  the  spread  of  COVID-19  was  associated  with  work  from  home  guidelines 
which cased private and public schools, colleges, and universities in all the states in 
the  United  States  to  switch  to  remote  or  online  teaching  methods  for  an  extended 
period of time. On account of the same, Google experienced an increase in online 
shopping  for  remote  learning-based  technologies,  applications,  products,  and  pro-
grams by both educators and students, as both these user groups strived to address 
their needs  and demands  associated with  adjusting  to  this  new  norm  of  education. 
This resulted in the generation of Big Data from the relevant web behavior on Google 
since  the  outbreak  of  this  pandemic  in  the  United  States.  In  this  paper,  we  have 
presented an approach to investigate, analyze, quantify, and interpret these trends of 
Google Shopping related to remote learning that emerged since March 13, 2020, on 
account of COVID-19 from all over the 50-United States. This interdisciplinary study 
at the intersections of Big Data, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, 
Data  Science,  and  Human-Computer  Interaction,  was  performed  using  Google 
Trends.  The  results  presented  and  discussed  uphold  the  relevance  of  this  study 
towards  the  interpretation  of  Google  Shopping-based  web  behavior  related  to  the 
purchase  of  remote  learning-based  technologies,  applications,  products,  and 
programs originating from each of these states. The results also discuss the associated 
trends in Google Shopping-based web behavior by comparing the magnitude of the 
associated search interests. Finally, the interpretation of the results also indicates the 
potential of this approach for studying market potential, sales outlook, and consumer 
perspectives of remote learning-based technologies in different geographic regions of 
the United States. Future work in this field would involve performing the study in 
other  countries  such  as  India,  Brazil,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  Russia,  which  are 
amongst the worst-hit countries by COVID-19.
