Abstract. The percentage of urban areas dedicated to streets and public spaces 
is a crucial feature of spatial planning of cities. By 2050 urban mobility will be 
one of the biggest confronts of cities around the globe. This study has been car-
ried out to assess the ratio of public space allocated to the streets in some cities 
of Bangladesh. The length, width, area and number of street crossings have been 
counted for city core and its suburban area, as an indicator of the form and pat-
tern of the street layout. In this exercise, the rest of the public space, like gardens 
and general public spaces for amenities, including sports, are not taken into ac-
count.  The  methodology of  data  collection  has  been  through  Google  Earth  and 
GIS software. For precise results, other more sophisticated software is essential. 
Nevertheless,  even  at  these  levels  of  precision,  very  interesting  city  patterns 
emerge. The findings of this study show that Bogra, Rangpur, Dinajpur are better 
cities having higher land allocation rate for street, including sufficient crossings. 
Nilphamari and Thakurgaon have lower land area for streets; tend to have lower 
connectivity and productivity. Rest of the cities has average land area for street 
and average number of street crossings. 

Keywords: Intersection, Street area, Street density, Urban mobility.

INTRODUCTION 

Urban mobility often used to indicate a set of interrelated measures to satisfy the 
mobility needs of people and businesses, today and tomorrow; in city and their 
surrounding  areas.  Urban mobility  can ensure  accessibility  to  the transport sys-
tem to all, improve safety and security, reduce pollution and can make the urban 
environment attractive. It is one of the toughest challenges that cities face today 
as existing mobility systems are close to breakdown (Little A., 2014). The ques-
tion of how to enhance urban  mobility while at the same time reducing conges-
tion,  accidents  and  pollution  is  a  common  challenge  to  all  major  cities  in  the 
world.  

National  guideline  for  urban  mobility  planning  provides  orientation  to  local 
authorities.  In  several  countries,  such  as  Brazil,  France  and  India,  the  develop-
ment of urban mobility plans has become an obligatory requirement for receiving 
national  government  funds  for  local  transport  projects  (GIZ,  2014).  Too  often, 
transport infrastructure fails  to  keep  up  with  the  mobility  needs  of  the  growing 
urban population. Setting a city on a sustainable course regarding its land use and 
transport  system  requires  a  clear  roadmap  of  urban  mobility  plan.  A  successful 
urban mobility plan can provide a feasible and powerful strategy to tackle urban 
mobility challenges.  

The percentage of urban areas dedicated to streets and public spaces is a cru-
cial feature of urban mobility. Cities that have adequate street and public spaces 
and  greater  connectivity  are  more  livable  and  productive  (UN-Habitat,  2013a). 
The significance of urban mobility plan in providing solution for urban transport 
system in Bangladesh holds in stark contrast with the very limited research on the 
topic.  Lack  of  information  on  characteristics  and  scale  of  ‘Urban  Mobility’ 
makes it difficult to formulate appropriate policies and this paper attempts to un-
cover these facts. 

2  OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY 

Mobility flows have become a key concern of urbanization. Despite the increas-
ing  level  of  urban  mobility  worldwide,  access  to  places,  activities  and  services 
has become increasingly difficult (UN-Habitat, 2013b). Many of the world’s cit-
ies face an unprecedented accessibility crisis, and are characterized by unsustain-
able mobility systems.  

The aim of the study is to examine the state of urban mobility in some select-
ed cities of Bangladesh. It attempts to explore the linkages between percentage of 
urban  land  allocated  for  street  network  and  level  of  urban  mobility.  The  study 
also intends to highlight the status of different mobility parameters of each cities 
and  their  interrelation  on  the  mobility  ranking  of  all  cities.  Finally,  the  study 
plans to compare the state of urban mobility among Bangladeshi cities with some 
international cities.

3  METHODOLOGY 

Percentage land area for street, street density and number of intersection are the 
parameters under which mobility ranking of study cities are conducted to propose 
whether a city is highly, moderately or poorly accessible. The study used ortho-
photos and GIS in determination of public space allocated to street in ten north-
ern cities of Bangladesh. The number of street crossings also counted during the 
study. Images from ‘Google Earth’ were analyzed in AutoCAD first to find out 
the street length, street area and number of crossings. 

Dinajpur,  Bogra,  Lalmonirhat,  Pabna,  Sirajganj,  Rangpur,  Nawabganj, 
Rajshahi,  Nilphamri,  Thakurgaon  city  are  selected  as  study  area.  At  the  begin-
ning, orthophotos of those cities are captured from Google Earth. Shape file of a 
particular city (under study) is collected and used in GIS software (Arc View) to 
convert it into KML file for projection on Google Earth. While considering a city 
under study, city core and suburb areas are considered for mobility analysis. City 
core  is  considered  taking  a  particular  radius  around  the  buildup  city  centre.  A 
greater  study  area  has  been  considered  ranging  from  city  center  to  suburb  to 
compare on the mentioned parameters. Using “Add Path” tool in Google Earth, 
street layout of  all visible streets is drawn from  Google  Earth. The entire street 
network of study area including city core and suburb was exported to Auto CAD 
by converting the KML file to DXF file to work in AutoCAD platform. The map 
was drawn in proper scale. The entire area (city core and suburb) is divided into 
number of small blocks, using separate ‘hatches’, in Auto CAD. Street length is 
determined  using  ‘tlen’  AutoLISP  program.  Land  area  and  street area  are  com-
puted for individual small blocks and the sum of all block determines total urban 
land area for street and the percentage of land allocated to street.   

4  FIXATION OF STREETS IN CITY CORE AND SUBURBAN AREA 

The city boundary is fixed by exporting the shape file of the corresponding city 
in Google Earth. For example, fixing of city core including suburb for Dinajpur 
city is shown in Fig. 1, 2 & 3 respectively.

5  COMPUTATION OF STREET LENGTH AND STREET AREA 

Entire street layout is drawn in Google Earth (Fig 4). Length, width and land area 
of  all  streets  and  number  of  crossings  are  counted  after  the  map  is  exported  to 
AutoCAD  (Fig  5)  from  Google  Earth.  Fig  6  shows  street  layout,  hatched  areas 
and street-intersections respectively for Dinajpur city.

Following the steps, street databases of all cities are prepared. For example street 
database for Dinajpur is presented in Table 2.

6  RESULTS & DISCUSSION 

6.1  Mobility Gradation of Cities 

Table  3  shows  a  very  important  disparity  of  land  allocation  rate  for  street  net-
work,  varying  from  8.91  to  18.75  percent.  This  disparity  itself  is  a  good  entry 
point  to  describe  the  urban  mobility  consequences  in  cities  in  Bangladesh.  The 
top five cities ranges between 16.35 and 18.75 percent of urban land allocated to 
the street and may be considered as cities having good mobility. Land allocation 
rate falls  between 14.18 and 15.94 percent of  some cities which are considered 
having average mobility. Finally, cities having land allocation rate between 8.91 
and  9.03  percent,  may  be  considered  as  cities  having  poor  mobility.  Table  4 
shows above average, average and below average ranking of cities based on the 
criteria of street density. Fig 7 and Fig 8 are graphical representation of ranking 
of cities based on percentage of urban land for street and street density.  In both 
cases,  Dinajpur  and  Bogra  city  are  top  ranking  cities  having  street  density  and

percentages of street area holds above average range. On the other hand, Nilpha-
mari and Thakurgaon city has the lowest ranking having street density and  per-
centages  of  street  area  having  below  average  range.  The  remaining  cities  like 
Rajshahi (Boalia Thana), Sirajganj, Rangpur, Pabna, Nawabganj and Lalmonirhat 
has average accessibility and mobility.

Fig 9: Inter-relation between Percentages of Street Area & Intersection Density 

The central area of the city has been chosen, meaning areas of less than 5.0 km2, 
in order to ensure the comparability of different cities. This provides for an inter-
esting  mixture  of  space  and  pattern  which  explains  about  the  efficiency  of  the 
city. The result explores these factors in order to develop efficient tools of plot-
ting for the matrix of the public space in the urban areas. 

6.3  Frequency of Cities based on the Mobility Parameters 

It is important to understand that the quantity of the public space is not related to 
the price of land. In general, the price of land is much higher in cities that have 
more public space. This should be an additional reason to ensure proper delinea-

899 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Riffat Islam and Md. Kamruzzaman 

tion of unbuilt space at the beginning of urbanization, when the price of land is 
cheaper. Figure 10 shows that there are about 5 cities having land area more 16% 
for street network and only 2 cities having lass than 12% land for  street. Cities 
are more accessible and attractive if the street area and open space are more.  

Figure 11 displays the number of street intersections per km2 of urban ar-
ea  in  selected  cities  as  measured  by  the  described  methodology.  Cities  range 
from 1267 (Dinajpur) to 169 (Takurgaon) crossings per km2. Cities having more 
crossing are considered walkable and appropriate in many cities, in order to gen-
erate street life and for moving goods and services productively and efficiently. 
Majority of cities of Bangladesh have good number of intersection.

6.4  Comparison between International and Cities of Bangladesh 

Fig 12 provides a clear representation of scale of urban mobility among various 
international  cities  and  Northern  cities  of  Bangladesh  based  on  percentages  of 
land area for street and number of crossing respectively. In general, international 
cities  have  more  urban  lands  allocated  for  street  and  more  intersections,  which 
causes better mobility.  

7  CONCLUSION 

Ranking of cities according to the parameters gives a clear depiction of how mo-
bility strengthens the accessibility of a high ranked city (Bogra) whereas weakens 
that  of a  low ranked  city  (Thakurgaon). These  findings  provides  an entry  point 
for addressing the issue of urban mobility, inefficiency or lack of urban planning 
and clearly suggest the high priority that cities in Bangladesh should put on early 
attention to planning when land is still inexpensive, in order to avoid future grid-
locks and congestion.
