ABSTRACT
Sensors are one of the most pervasive and integral components of
today’s safety-critical systems. Sensors serve as a bridge between
physical quantities and connected systems. The connected systems
with sensors blindly believe the sensor as there is no way to authen-
ticate the signal coming from a sensor. This could be an entry point
for an attacker. An attacker can inject a fake input signal along with
the legitimate signal by using a suitable spoofing technique. As the
sensor’s transducer is not smart enough to differentiate between a
fake and legitimate signal, the injected fake signal eventually can
collapse the connected system. This type of attack is known as
the transduction attack. Over the last decade, several works have
been published to provide a defense against the transduction attack.
However, the defenses are proposed on an ad-hoc basis; hence, they
are not well-structured. Our work begins to fill this gap by provid-
ing a checklist that a defense technique should always follow to be
considered as an ideal defense against the transduction attack. We
name this checklist as the Golden reference of sensor defense. We
provide insights on how this Golden reference can be achieved and
argue that sensors should be redesigned from the transducer level
to the sensor electronics level. We point out that only hardware or
software modification is not enough; instead, a hardware/software
(HW/SW) co-design approach is required to ride on this future
roadmap to the robust and resilient sensor.

1 INTRODUCTION
Sensors work as the eyes and ears of any embedded system. There-
fore, any decision taken by a system depends upon the data coming
from a sensor. Though sensors are technically developed nowadays
compared to their earlier generation, from a security point of view,
almost all sensors are still unsafe and prone to intelligent attacks
by an attacker. The reason behind this is that the signals that a sen-
sor measures in the surrounding environment are analog signals,
which are not encrypted in the environment. Therefore, sensors
cannot differentiate between a legitimate analog input and a fake
analog input provided by an attacker. As a result, the transducer of
a sensor converts any fake analog signal given as the input into a
usable signal (e.g., an electrical signal), which is then propagated
to downstream of the signal path and eventually arrives at the sys-
tem controller. As the system controller does not have any way
to authenticate the signal coming from a sensor, it has to blindly

believe the sensor and then make decision based upon the sensor
data. As there is no hardware/software firewall present between
the sensor and the system interface, this could be an entry point
for an attacker. An attacker can noninvasively inject fake signals
into sensors by using a suitable spoofing technique [3, 30, 33, 35]
and may compromise the system availability and integrity, causing
a system failure and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on systems.

As the attack at hand fools the sensor’s transducer, this type
of attack is named as the transduction attack [13]. There has been
ongoing research on the transduction attack for the last two decades.
However, this paper shows that defenses against this transduction
attack are still not well-structured, and little to no work is done in
the sensor defense domain. We point out that almost all defenses
against the transduction attack are proposed on an ad-hoc basis.
Therefore, there is no systematic approach present in the literature
for defense. Our work begins to fill this gap by providing a checklist
of reference points that an ideal defense should always follow to be
considered as a successful defense against the transduction attack.
We name this checklist as the Golden reference for sensor defense.
This Golden reference is the roadmap to a secured sensor that
every designer should follow in the future before finally adopt-
ing a technique as a sensor defense. We also provide insights on
how to achieve the Golden reference. We point out that the Golden
reference for sensor defense can not be achieved alone by only hard-
ware or only software modification; instead, a hardware/software
(HW/SW) co-design approach is required in the sensor domain.
The sensors should be redesigned from the transducer level to the
sensor electronics level with the integration of smart hardware and
software. We believe that the defenses highlighted in this paper
will be relevant soon when sensors will pervade our lives.

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Sensor physics
A sensor is an instrument that senses physical input signals from
the environment and converts the measured physical quantities
into understandable data that can be interpreted by either a human
or a machine. For example, a simple glass thermometer presents
visual data, which can be interpreted by a human, and an elec-
tronic pressure sensor can provide electronic data, which can be
interpreted by machines. There are a multitude of types of sensors
and the physics behind the conversion of physical input signals to
understandable data varies from one sensor to another. However,
all sensors have a common physics that is systematized below.

Sensing structure and transducer: The most common sensor
physics is that all the sensors use a sensing structure, which typ-
ically senses the physical input signals and uses a transducer to
convert the sensed physical input signals into understandable data

Barua et al.

(see Fig. 1). For example, a pressure sensor has a diaphragm as
the sensing structure and uses a capacitor plate as the transducer
to convert the displacement of the diaphragm into an electrical
signal. The converted understandable data is ideally proportional
to physical input signals. Mathematically, if the sensed physical
input signal is 𝑆𝑖𝑛 and the corresponding converted data from the
transducer is 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛, we can write 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛 as follows:

𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛 = 𝑘 × 𝑓 {𝑆𝑖𝑛 }

(1)

where 𝑘 is a proportionality constant and 𝑓 {𝑆𝑖𝑛 } is a function
of the 𝑆𝑖𝑛. It is important to note that 𝑓 {𝑆𝑖𝑛 } can be a function of
any type. For example, for a Hall sensor, 𝑓 {𝑆𝑖𝑛 } is a linear function
of input magnetic fields and for a p-n junction temperature sensor,
𝑓 {𝑆𝑖𝑛 } is an exponential function of input temperature 𝑇 (i.e., 𝑒𝑇 ).

Figure 1: A basic overview of the sensor physics.

2.2 Sensor electronics
Though sensing structure and transducer are common in all sen-
sors, most sensors have other additional electronics to improve the
sensed signal quality (see Fig. 1). The converted understandable
data 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛 is typically an analog signal, which is given as an input to
a differential amplifier to remove the common mode noise. A single
or multiple stages of signal conditioning filters are applied after-
ward, which is followed by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
for the data digitization. Filters are typically LPF used to remove
high-frequency noise signals from the measurement. Typically, ana-
log sensors output the analog signals from the differential amplifier
or filters directly, while digital sensors contain the LPF and ADC.

2.3 Operating region and saturation region
As mentioned in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the shape of the data 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛
from the transducer can be linear, exponential or any other types
and is given as an input to different filtration blocks (see Fig. 1). As
these filters are powered by a finite power supply, the maximum
value of 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛 the filters can handle is limited by the power supply.
In fact, the output 𝑆𝑓 from the filtration block will begin to flatten
when the 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛 is too large and the power supply limits are reached.
The region, where the output 𝑆𝑓 is not flattened, is known as the
operating region of the sensor (see Fig. 2). This region is typically
linear between the signal 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛 and 𝑆𝑓 . In contrast, the region, where
the output 𝑆𝑓 is flattened, is known as the saturation region of the
sensor. Please note that the exact value of the input 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛 cannot be
recovered while the filter output 𝑆𝑓 is in the saturation region.

Figure 2: Operating and saturation region of a sensor.

2.4 Sensor physics from security perspective
Entry point for an attacker: Over the last three decades, trans-
ducers and sensing structures have been technically improved in
terms of stability, accuracy, and sensitivity; however, to the best
of our knowledge, designers still do not consider security as one
of the fundamental requirements while designing transducers and
sensing structures of sensors. As a result, it is noteworthy that all
the transducers and sensing structures are naive, and they cannot
differentiate between legitimate input signals and malicious fake
input signals. As a consequence, if an adversary injects malicious
fake input signals into the sensing structure, the injected fake input
signals are converted into understandable data by transducers and
then propagate up to the system controller. The system controller
blindly trusts signals coming from sensors. Therefore, this can be
an entry point for an attacker. An attacker can noninvasively inject
fake input signals to the transducers or sensing structures and can
fool the system controller, resulting in a catastrophic failure, system
shutdown, or disruption of the system’s normal behavior.

Systematization of the attack signal: We need to emphasize
again that the only reason that facilitates this attack is that the
sensor structure and the transducer cannot differentiate between
the legitimate input signals and the malicious fake input signals.
Therefore, this type of attack is denoted by the transduction attack
[13, 32]. Let’s denote malicious fake input signals by 𝑆 𝑓
𝑖𝑛. Therefore,
the output 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛 from the transducer in Eqn. 1 can be written as:
𝑐𝑜𝑛 = 𝑘 × 𝑓 {𝑆𝑖𝑛 + 𝑆 𝑓
𝑆 𝑓

(2)

𝑖𝑛 }

where 𝑆 𝑓

𝑐𝑜𝑛 is the output from the transducer after the injection
of the malicious fake input signals 𝑆 𝑓
𝑐𝑜𝑛 can propa-
gate from the transducer to the upper level as the existing sensor
electronics blindly believe what is coming from the transducer.

𝑖𝑛. The term 𝑆 𝑓

Scope of our work: We consider only those attacks that origi-
nate from the fake signal injection into the sensing structures and
transducers. Let us give an example to clarify the scope of our
work. A pressure sensor can measure room pressure. If an attacker
changes the room pressure by switching on/off the heating, ven-
tilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) unit of the room, the room
pressure changes. As a result, the pressure sensor measures a cor-
rupted room pressure. We are not considering this type of attack on
the pressure sensor. Instead, we are considering that type of attack,
where the attacker directly injects fake signals into the sensing
structure (i.e., diaphragm) and transducer of the pressure sensor.

3 SENSOR ATTACK MODEL
The basic components of the sensor attack model is explained below
and also shown in Fig. 3.

i. Attacker’s capability: The attacker may not get a long time
to modify the sensor like a lunch-time attack [14]. Instead, the
attacker may get a brief access near the sensor to inject the fake
input signal 𝑆 𝑓
𝑖𝑛 is a
physical signal coming from the physical domain in different forms,
such as acoustics, ultrasound, infrared, visible light, magnetic field,
and electric field, and impacting the cyber domain [11] of the sensor
and connected systems.

of the sensor using physical tempering. This type of physical in-
vasive attack is out of the scope of our study. Instead, our attack
considers a scenario where the attacker injects a fake input signal to
noninvasively perturb the sensor’s transducer in a stealthy manner.

Figure 3: Basic components of the sensor attack model.
iii. Attack’s outcome: As mentioned in Section 2.3, a sensor
has a linear operating region and a flattened saturation region. The
attacker can inject a fake input signal 𝑆 𝑓
𝑖𝑛 to spoof the sensor output
in its linear region or drive the sensor output to its saturation region.
In the linear region, the attacker can force the sensor to work at a
particular operating point and can cause an adversarial control. For
example, an attacker can use magnetic fields to spoof a Hall sensor
in its linear region located in a solar inverter and can intentionally
change the power of the solar inverter [2–4].

In the saturation region, the input-output linear relationship
of sensors gets flattened, and sensors go completely blind to any
variation of the input. This may cause catastrophic failure in the
normal operation of the connected systems resulting in a DoS attack.
Typically, the attacker requires a stronger fake input signal to drive
the sensor output to its saturation region [7].

4 CURRENT PROGRESS
Sensor security is comparatively a new domain in the security
community that has ongoing research for the last two decades.
However, over the last decades, the research on sensor security has
been accelerated due to the advent of the smart sensing systems
in autonomous vehicles (AV), internet-of-things (IoT), and smart
automation systems. Our paper broadly classifies the ongoing re-
search on sensor security into two categories: (i) current progress
on sensor attack and (ii) current progress on sensor defense.

4.1 Current progress on sensor attack
We discuss sensor attacks in the following broad categories. A
summary of the most notable published work on sensor attack is
given in Table 1 with their publication years.

Attack on magnetic sensors: Barua et al. [3] demonstrated a
noninvasive attack on Hall sensors located in a solar inverter using
a magnetic field from a close distance, resulting in a shutdown of a
weak micro-grid. Shoukry et al. [21] showed a disruptive magnetic
spoofing attack on a Hall sensor located in an anti-lock braking
system (ABS) of a vehicle, resulting in a possible brake failure.

Attack on inertial sensors: Wang et al. [30] used an ultrasonic
gun to spoof different inertial sensors, such as MEMS accelerome-
ters and gyroscopes, at their resonant frequencies to create havoc
in the connected systems. Son et al. [25] used a powerful sound
wave to spoof the gyroscope of a drone at its resonance frequency,
making the drone uncontrollable. Trippel et al. [26], and Tu et al.
[27] showed an adversarial control over MEMS accelerometers and
gyroscopes using acoustic signals at their resonant frequencies.
Bolton et al. [10] showed how acoustic signal can compromise the
MEMS shock sensor located in a hard disk drive.

Attack on pressure sensors: Barua et al. [5] demonstrated a
spoofing attack on pressure sensors located in a negative pres-
sure room (NPR), using acoustic signal at the sensor’s resonant
frequency. Tu et al. [28] showed a deliberate electromagnetic inter-
ference (EMI) attack on an inflation pump’s pressure sensor while
impacting the system’s actuation.

Attack on optical sensors: Park et al. [17] used infrared to
spoof optical sensors of an infusion pump to deliver overdose to
patients. Davidson et al. [12] reported how spoofing optical sensors
of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can compromise its complete
control. Shin et al. [19] showed a spoofing attack on Lidar to create
illusions of objects appearing closer in automotive systems.

Attack on acoustic sensors: Zhang et al. [35] injected inaudi-
ble commands into a microphone using ultrasonic carriers. Yan et
al. [33] showed an attack on ultrasonic sensors of a vehicle using
acoustic waves to impair vehicle safety.

Attack on other analog sensors: Kune et al. [16] spoofed sen-

sors by EMI to induce defibrillation shocks on cardiac devices.

It is just a matter of time before more attacks on sensors will
emerge from different attack surfaces as sensors are getting complex
and sophisticated nowadays without improving their security.

4.2 Current progress on sensor defense
We discuss sensor defense in the following broad categories. A
summary of the most notable sensor defenses is given in Table 2.

Defense for magnetic sensors: Barua et al. [3] proposed strong
magnetic shielding with a secure surrounding to prevent the mag-
netic spoofing attack on Hall sensors. Shoukry et al. [21] proposed
PyCRA to randomize the transmission and reception of signals to
prevent magnetic spoofing attacks on ABS sensors of automotive.
However, PyCRA only works for active sensors [21].

Defense for inertial sensors: Trippel et al. [26] proposed ran-
domized and 1800 out-of-phase sampling to nullify acoustic spoof-
ing signals injected into MEMS accelerometers. Son et al. [25] pro-
posed resonance tuning using a feedback capacitor to prevent the
out-band resonant frequency. Wang et al. [30] proposed to use an
external microphone to detect the resonating sound and perform
noise cancellation. Tu et al. [27] proposed low-pass filtering (LPF)
along with the dampening of the injected ultrasound.

Defense for pressure sensors: Barua et al. [5] used an LPF to
filter out the sound wave from pressure sensors to prevent acoustic
spoofing on pressure sensors. Tu et al. [28] used a transduction
shield to measure the fake signal first and then subtract it from the
corrupted signal to recover the legitimate signal.

Defense for optical sensors: Park et al. [17] measured the light
intensity to detect the attack and used PyCRA to prevent it. Shin
et al. [19] propose sensor fusion and redundancy to prevent the
optical attack on a lidar.

Defense for acoustic sensors: Zhang et al. [35] used a modu-
lation - demodulation based noise canceling technique to cancel
out the injected ultrasound. Yan et al. [33] proposed shielding and
acoustic noise reduction (ANR) by emitting a sound with minor
phase and amplitude adjustment.

Defense for other analog sensors: Kune et al. [16] proposed
adaptive filtering to estimate the spoofing attack signal first and
then subtract the estimated attack signal from the original signal
to clean up the original signal.

5 RESEARCH CHALLENGES
The defense techniques described in Section 4.2 have research chal-
lenges. A summary of research challenges is given in Table 2.

Shielding and dampening: Barua et al. [3] and Tu et al. [27]
proposed shielding to dampen the injected fake magnetic field and
fake ultrasound, respectively. Though shielding is a cheap and quick
countermeasure for a few of the fake injected signals, such as sound
wave, ultrasound, and infrared, shielding might fail for other signals,

such as magnetic fields. For example, a strong shield again may fail
to a stronger magnetic field injected by an attacker. To increase
the shielding property of a shield so that it can work for a stronger
attack signal, the designer may need to increase the thickness of
the shield. As even a thick shield can be penetrated by a stronger
magnetic field, there is no sweet spot for shielding to claim that
it can prevent a magnetic field of any strength. Therefore, only
shielding cannot be considered as a sole defense for sensors.

Randomization of transmission (PyCRA): Shoukry et al [22]
proposed PyCRA; however, PyCRA only works for active sensors,
not for passive sensors. Moreover, Shin et al. [20] showed that the
implemented authentication mechanism of PyCRA can be success-
fully bypassed with a low-cost circuit. This proves that there is
currently no effective, robust and generalizable defense scheme
against active sensor spoofing attacks.

Randomized and 1800 out-of-phase sampling: These two
techniques from [26] only work for out-band resonant frequency
attack signals. However, they do not work other than a specific
resonant frequency, for example, any attack frequency. Moreover,
they do not work against a DC forged signal because randomized
sampling cannot filter out a DC signal. In addition, they do not
work when the sensor output is flattened in the saturation region.
Adaptive filter and transduction shield: Both of these de-
fense techniques from [16, 28] work similarly by estimating the
spoofing attack signal first and then subtracting the estimated at-
tack signal from the original signal to clean up the original signal.
These techniques will fail in the following two scenarios: (i) Be-
cause of the finite physical distance between the adaptive filter or
transduction shield and the compromised sensor, the adaptive filter
or transduction shield cannot measure the exact amplitude of the
external attack signals. This is why we can not simply subtract the
estimated attack signals from the original signals to recover the
original signal. (ii) They do not work when the sensor output is
flattened in the saturation region.

LPF and other filtering techniques: LPF and other filtering
techniques in [5, 16] only work as a successful defense when the
fake attack signal has a predicable frequency spectrum and is an out-
band signal. If the injected fake signal shares the same frequency
band as the legitimate signal, LPF or other filtering techniques
cannot accurately filter out the fake attack signals. The reason

Sensor Security: Current Progress, Research Challenges, and Future Roadmap (Invited Paper)

41st ICCAD, 30 October–3 November, 2022, San Diego, CA

behind this is that while filtering the attack signals, they also filter
out the same band of legitimate signals.

by the Golden reference for a sensor defense against a transduction
attack. This golden reference has the following points.

Machine learning (ML) techniques: Machine learning (ML)
techniques require complex computations to converge for attack
detection and recovery, requiring powerful hardware resources.
Therefore, they are not suitable for low-power real-time sensor
systems with constrained resources. In addition, they may not work
against a time-varying magnetic spoofing as a time-varying signal
may create oscillations between two safe states of the controller,
and they are incapable of handling these oscillations in real-time.

5.1 Area of focus
If we analyze all the notable defenses from Table 2 published
throughout the last decade, we can conclude the following points:
■ The defenses were proposed on an ad-hoc basis. For example,
the researchers first find a security issue with the sensor and then
try to come up with a defense to overcome it. Researchers only
focus on a specific security issue rather than focusing on all the
corner cases from all the attack surfaces. Therefore, a proposed
defense for a particular type of sensor is not applicable to other
types. For example, the randomized and 1800 out-of-phase sampling
[26], which are applicable for MEMS inertial sensors to nullify out-
band resonant attack frequency, is not applicable for magnetic Hall
sensors because Hall sensors can have in-band attack frequency
other than a specific out-band resonant frequency [3].

■ There is no defense technique exists in the literature that can
prevent sensors from going into the saturation region or recover
information from the sensor’s saturation region.

■ There is no defense, which can contain a fake injected signal

having the same frequency as the legitimate signal.

■ As PyCRA [22] can be bypassed, there is no defense in the

literature for active sensors till to date.

Therefore, sensor security is still a malnourished domain, which

requires more attention from security researchers.

6 FUTURE ROADMAP
Sensor heterogeneity: The fundamental challenge of designing
and modeling a robust and secured sensor is the heterogeneity of
sensor types. The heterogeneity of sensors exists because of the
sensor’s signal modality, which differs from the sensor to sensor. For
example, a Hall sensor handles magnetic fields and a pressure sensor
handles pressure waves as the signal modality. As sensors differ
from each other in terms of signal modality, the proper selection of
transducers and sensor electronics also differ from sensor to sensor
depending on the signal modality. Therefore, a single generalized
defense technique that is applicable to all sensors will be quite
complicated. However, it is still worth giving it a try from a sensor
security research point of view because the future days will be the
days for smart sensors, and security will be a big concern for them.

(i) The defense should simultaneously work for in-band and out-

band fake injected input signals.

(ii) The defense should prevent a sensor from going into the satura-

tion region because of the injection of fake input signals.
(iii) The defense should contain a fake injected signal even it has the

same frequency as the legitimate input signal.

(iv) The defense should work for active and passive sensors. If a
single defense does not simultaneously work for both sensors,
there should be a defense targeting an active sensor and another
separate defense targeting a passive sensor.

(v) The defense should be hard real-time.
(vi) The defense should not hamper the existing data processing

speed or bandwidth of the sensor.

6.2 Roadmap to achieve the Golden reference
The Golden reference for sensor defense can not be achieved alone
by only hardware or only software modification; instead, a hard-
ware/software (HW/SW) co-design approach is required in the sen-
sor domain. The sensors should be redesigned from the transducer
level to the sensor electronics level. A smart transducer should be
built instead of a naive one, and an intelligent and low-complexity
algorithm should be adopted in the sensor electronics. We explain
the roadmap to achieve the Golden reference below.

6.2.1 Encrypted analog signal: The main reason for sensor vul-
nerability is that the legitimate analog signal 𝑆𝑖𝑛, which is going
to be measured by the sensor, is not encrypted before going into
the transducer. Therefore, the attacker can use a fake signal 𝑆 𝑓
𝑖𝑛 to
corrupt the legitimate signal 𝑆𝑖𝑛. This problem can be solved by
encrypting the legitimate analog signal with a key in the analog
domain and decrypting the legitimate signal in the transducer side
or in the sensor electronics using the same key. The analog domain
encryption can be achieved using the following ways:

■ First, an orthogonal noise can be padded with the legitimate
signal 𝑆𝑖𝑛 to hide the information from the attack surface. This
method is known as analog scrambling [18].

■ Second, the legitimate signal 𝑆𝑖𝑛 can be mapped into the broad
spectrum. This technique is known as frequency hopping spread
spectrum [15] and can be adopted in the sensor domain.

■ Third, the legitimate signal 𝑆𝑖𝑛 can be encrypted in the analog
domain using a pseudo-noise, which is the original key. More keys
can be generated using the original key to decrypt the signal [24].
Please note that encryption of the legitimate analog signal is
the ultimate solution for a robust sensor. This defense technique
would achieve the points i-iv of the Golden reference in Section 6.1;
however, it may or may not hamper the data processing speed (point
v) and real-time requirement (point vi) of the sensor depending
upon the encryption complexity.

The next generation of research on sensor security should have to
consider the security from designing the transducer to the imple-
mentation of the sensor electronics. Instead of implementing an
ad-hoc defense, researchers must ensure a checklist before finally
adopting a technique as a sensor defense. We name this checklist

6.2.2 Modifying the transducer: The transducer must be re-
silient enough to reject the injected fake signal 𝑆 𝑓
𝑖𝑛. As a transducer
is an entry point to the sensor, if a transducer can reject the fake
signal, this approach would diminish the burden of using a complex
encryption algorithm in the sensor hardware. Industry is adopt-
ing this scheme nowadays where ever it is feasible. For example,

Barua et al.

Hall current sensors use a Hall element as a transducer. Two Hall
elements (see Fig. 4) are placed inside of a Hall current sensor in
a differential manner to reject common-mode noise [1]. As the in-
jected fake signal 𝑆 𝑓
𝑖𝑛 is common to the differential Hall element,
the injected fake signal 𝑆 𝑓
𝑖𝑛 can be considered as common-mode
noise and can be eliminated from the sensor at the transducer level.
Though this strategy is quite novel, it has its own implementation
challenge for all types of sensors. Research along this direction
would be influential in future for a secured sensor.

Figure 4: A basic overview of the differential sensing.

6.2.3 Preventing sensor saturation: As mentioned in Section 3,
if an attacker can drive the sensor to its saturation region, the output
gets flattened, and no information can be retrieved, resulting in a
DoS attack on sensors. This attack is known as saturation attack [7].
The core idea behind preventing a saturation attack is to generate
an internal signal, which has the same strength but in opposite
polarity to the injected fake signal, so that the internal signal can
nullify the injected fake signal. Barua et al. [7] conceptualized and
implemented this idea in the context of Hall magnetic sensors by
providing a defense named PreMSat. The idea of PreMSat can be
extended to other sensor types as well.

Improving the adaptive filter and transduction shield:
6.2.4
The main bottleneck of using the adaptive filter and transduction
shield is the introduced error in the estimated attack signals for
the physical distance present between the sensor and the shield
(see Section 5). This problem can be solved by using an improved
defense algorithm proposed by Barua et al. [6]. The main idea of
this algorithm is that the difference between the measured signal
during the attack and before the attack gives the amount of injected
error after the attack. This algorithm tracks this difference all the
time and generates a feedback signal to nullify the injected error
by the attacker. The idea is illustrated in Fig. 5.

6.2.5 Context-aware anomaly detection: An injected fake sig-
nal can be considered as an anomaly. Traditional anomaly detection
algorithms are not low-power and hence, they are not suitable for
sensor hardware. Therefore, a low-power and low- complexity algo-
rithm may be another feasible option to run on the sensor hardware
to detect injected fake signals. A low-power anomaly detection al-
gorithm named as Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) can be
evaluated to detect context aware anomaly detection on the sensor
data [8, 9]. Moreover, the context-aware sensor association method
[34] can be evaluated further as a defense technique for sensors.

6.2.6 Control-theoretic approach: State estimation and state
recovery based control-theoretic defense approaches can be an-
other option to recover a system controller after the transduction
attack. Shoukry et al. [23] proposed reconstructing the sensor state
to recover from a sensor spoofing attack using the satisfiability
modulo theory (SMT). Wang et al. [29] demonstrated a graph-based
technique to track states in the system controller to detect an in-
trusion. However, the correct direction will be to incorporate the
sensor’s physics and physical knowledge of the system with the
control-theoretic approach for accurate estimation of the states.

6.2.7 Sensor fusion based context aware: Sensor fusion and
redundancy [10, 19, 30, 31] based approaches can be merged with
ML algorithm to create an appropriate context and abstraction of
the sensor data. Therefore, during an attack, the sensor data can
be recovered from a proper context using abstracted sensor data.
The data abstraction can be made intelligent and adaptive to tackle
the continuous change of the sensor environment. However, sensor
fusion adds extra price and complexity to the system; therefore,
designers try to avoid this unless it is arguably required.

7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present a notion of sensor security, whereby, we
focus on the importance of security measures that needs to be taken
while designing a sensor. We discuss that sensors are vulnerable to
external fake signals and give a summary of existing defenses in
the sensor domain. We point out the limitations of existing defense
techniques and emphasize that very little to no work exists in the
sensor security domain. Therefore, we emphasize that the next
generation of research on sensor security should have to ensure a
Golden reference before finally adopting a technique as a sensor
defense. We also provide a roadmap on how to achieve the Golden
reference checklist while designing a robust and resilient sensor.
