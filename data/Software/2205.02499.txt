An important step in the planning of future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors and of the net-
works they will form is the estimation of their detection and parameter-estimation capabilities, which
is the basis of science-case studies. Several future GW detectors have been proposed or are under
development, which might also operate and observe in parallel. These detectors include terrestrial,
lunar, and space-borne detectors. In this paper, we present gwfisha, a new software to simulate
GW detector networks and to calculate measurement uncertainties based on the Fisher-matrix ap-
proximation. gwfish models the impact of detector motion on PE and makes it possible to analyze
multiband scenarios, i.e., observation of a GW signal by diﬀerent detectors in diﬀerent frequency
bands. We showcase a few examples for the Einstein Telescope (ET) including the sky-localization
of binary neutron stars, and ET’s capability to measure the polarization of GWs.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The gravitational-wave (GW) community is currently
in the phase of developing science cases and analysis tools
of future GW detector networks [1, 2] including potential
upgrades of the current infrastructures Virgo [3], LIGO
[4], LIGO India [5], KAGRA [6], and the proposed Ein-
stein Telescope [7, 8] and Cosmic Explorer [9]. The ap-
proved space-borne detector LISA is expected to begin
observations in the second half of the 2030s [10]. Entirely
new detector concepts are under study like the Lunar GW
Antenna (LGWA) [11]. The networks can be formed be-
tween alike detectors observing at the same frequencies,
but also combining observations in diﬀerent frequency
bands of the same GW sources [12–14]. Providing a sim-
ulation of conceivable observation scenarios formed by
these detectors is an important part of the science-case
development of future GW detector networks, but also
a challenging and potentially computationally expensive
task. In recent years, a few so-called Fisher-matrix codes
were developed for this purpose [14–16].

In this article, we present the simulation software gw-
fish, which uses frequency-domain GW models combined
with a time-domain simulation of GW detector networks
through the stationary-phase approximation. This cre-
ates a framework to study important aspects of PE with
future detector networks, where the change of position
and orientation of a detector during the observation of
a signal can have an important impact especially on
the sky localization [14, 15, 17, 18]. The calculation of
PE errors is done using the Fisher-matrix approximation
[19], which corresponds to a Gaussian approximation of
the likelihood expected to be acceptable for signals with
higher signal-to-noise ratio. When the Fisher matrix is

a github.com/janosch314/GWFish

used to directly evaluate PE errors like in gwfish, then
priors cannot be considered. As a consequence, overes-
timation and underestimation of PE errors are possible
[20]. It should be noted that Gaussian likelihood approx-
imations based on Fisher matrices can also be used for
posterior sampling, which leads to a signiﬁcant speed-up
of the likelihood evaluation. This method can be com-
bined with arbitrary priors.

A feature of gwfish is that multiband scenarios can
be simulated as well. It is a simple step to do with Fisher-
matrix codes since Fisher matrices for diﬀerent detectors
are added irrespective of the frequency band that pro-
vided the signal information. Technically, it just requires
to set up the code so that detector motion and signal
waveforms can be simulated accurately in diﬀerent fre-
quency bands. This includes the application of the time-
delay interferometry (TDI) formalism to simulate space-
borne detectors like LISA beyond the long-wavelength
regime [21–23], and the support of multiple components
of a detector, e.g., multiple interferometers of a xylo-
phone conﬁguration [24] or multiple sensors for LGWA
type detectors [11]. Each component can be assigned a
duty cycle for more realistic assessments of the observing
scenario. Details of the detector simulation are described
in section II.

The Fisher-matrix formalism is computationally eﬃ-
cient, but numerically less robust than posterior sam-
pling. The numerical challenges concern the calculation
of waveform derivatives and the inversion of Fisher matri-
ces. Waveform derivatives are best carried out in a hybrid
analytical-numerical scheme to minimize the computa-
tional eﬀort and numerical errors, and to keep it compat-
ible with arbitrary waveform models (also referred to as
waveform approximants). In gwfish, the numerical dif-
ferentiation is tuned to the properties of waveform mod-
els to reduce numerical errors. Concerning the inversion
of Fisher matrices, the main issue is that these matrices
can be very close to singular, i.e., with a huge range of

 
 
 
 
 
 
possible eigenvalues, which is connected to signal-model
degeneracies. To get accurate PE errors at least of the
parameters not involved in the model degeneracy, one
needs to systematically deal with matrix singularity. The
general PE framework of gwfish and how it addresses
the numerical challenges are described in section III.

As a demonstration, we show basic PE results for Ein-
stein Telescope (ET) in section IV, which is a good exam-
ple to understand the capabilities of gwfish, but also its
limitations since single-detector scenarios are especially
diﬃcult to model in the Fisher-matrix formalism due to
unavoidable degeneracies in the signal model. As a direct
scientiﬁc conclusion of these analyses, we conﬁrm that
the ET conﬁguration has unique capabilities for PE of
compact-binary coalescences. Other more detailed stud-
ies carried out with gwfish have been published in sepa-
rate papers. These include the evaluation of the perspec-
tives of multi-messenger observations for ET (as single
observatory and in network of GW detectors) operating
in synergy with γ and X-ray satellites using astrophys-
ically motivated populations of BNS mergers [25], and
very high-energy observatories (Banerjee et al. 2022 in
preparation). gwfish was also used for the simulation
of an astrophysical background in the ET null-stream
study [26].

II. DETECTOR-NETWORK SIMULATION

The simulation of a detector network needs to consider
several aspects, which are represented under diﬀerent cat-
egories inside gwfish:

2

with time. Especially the change in orientation is im-
portant to simulate. Since signals are represented in fre-
quency domain in gwfish, the question is how to con-
volve the detector response with the signal. In gwfish,
it is assumed that a function t(f ) exists mapping sig-
nal frequencies to times. To obtain this function, we
exploit the stationary phase approximation, which un-
derlies most analytical models of compact-binary signals
and is known to lead to very accurate approximations
of the Fourier spectrum of compact-binary signals [30].
This function can be calculated from the phase φ(f ) of
the waveform:

t(f ) =

1
2π

dφ(f )
df

.

(1)

A technical issue with this approach to calculate t(f ) is
that it requires a dense sampling in frequency space to
have enough resolution of the phase φ(f ) for a ﬁnite-
diﬀerence method. Since we do not want to impose any
unnecessary constraints on waveform modeling in gw-
fish, we instead calculate t(f ) directly from the lowest-
order term of the phase evolution, e.g., see equation (15)
in [31]. This approximation is acceptable since only the
early phase of the inspiral needs to be modeled accurately
to account for the eﬀects of detector motion on PE. Once
t(f ) is calculated for a signal, it can be used as a time vec-
tor for the simulation of the motion of the detectors. The
GW signal of a detector can then be written in terms of
a response tensor A(t(f )) contracted with the GW strain
tensor h(f ) [32]

R(f ) = A(t(f )) : h(f ).

• Component (laser interferometer, TDI channel, ac-
time-varying detector response to

celerometer):
GWs, noise modeling, duty cycle;

For example, the response tensor for a laser interferom-
eter with two arms along direction (cid:126)e1, (cid:126)e2 assumes the
form

• Detector: one or multiple components observing
the same frequency band and added as a group to
a detector network;

• Network: one or multiple detectors observing to-

gether.

Most of the eﬀort of the detector simulation goes into the
calculation of the detector response. We outline the ba-
sics and refer to other publications for details. The long-
wavelength approximation is applied to all terrestrial
GW detectors simulated with gwfish, which assumes
that the arm-length of a GW detector is much smaller
than the length of a GW. It is not a fully accurate approx-
imation above a kilohertz for a 40 km detector like the
proposed Cosmic Explorer [27–29]. The response formal-
ism for space-borne detectors can be adapted to ground-
based detectors, e.g., to calculate the GW response of
a Fabry-Perot cavity beyond the long-wavelength regime
[27].

The response of a detector is complicated by the fact
that the detector orientation and position can change

A =

1
2

((cid:126)e1 ⊗ (cid:126)e1 − (cid:126)e2 ⊗ (cid:126)e2),

(3)

where all quantities are functions of t(f ). It should be
noted that in the case of terrestrial detectors, the actual
frequency-dependent response of a GW detector, e.g.,
any aspect going into detector calibration, is included
in the instrument-noise spectrum referred to GW strain.

For LISA-type space detectors, another method must
be used to calculate the GW response since the long-
wavelength approximation does not hold [21]. The fun-
damental building blocks are the readouts yij(f ) of indi-
vidual spacecraft links j → i, which are then electroni-
cally combined with time delays to mimic the workings
of a laser interferometer. The main purpose of combin-
ing diﬀerent readouts is to reduce laser-frequency noise
by several orders of magnitude, which is achieved in ter-
restrial detectors by optical interference. This method is
called time-delay interferometry (TDI). Eﬀectively, TDI
makes each satellite of a triangular detector conﬁguration
a vertex of a laser interferometer. It turns out that the

3

sponse comes from the rotation of the Moon. The eﬀect
of its orbital motion around Earth is neglected.

III. PARAMETER ESTIMATION

The PE is simulated in gwfish through the Fisher-
matrix formalism, which is based on a Gaussian approx-
imation of the likelihood function:

L((cid:126)x) ∝ exp(−(cid:126)x (cid:124) · C−1 · (cid:126)x/2).

(5)

The covariance matrix C is the inverse of the Fisher ma-
trix F, and its components can be calculated from the
signal model h((cid:126)x ),

N

Fij =

(cid:104)∂xihk|∂xj hk(cid:105),

(6)

where N is the number of components of the GW detec-
tor network, and the derivatives of the waveform are cal-
culated with respect to the model parameters (cid:126)x = (xi).
The expression makes use of an inner product deﬁned on
the signal-model manifold as follows:

The product requires a model of the instrument noise
spectral density Sn(f ). The theoretical framework is sim-
ple, but there are practical challenges. First, for some of
the model parameters, the derivatives need to be calcu-

models, but one ought to adopt an approach that is valid
for all models. Numerical diﬀerentiation suﬀers from
limitations of numerical precision, e.g., some derivatives
might be calculated from tiny variations of potentially
very large numbers. In gwfish, derivatives with respect
to waveform phase at merger φc, merger time tc, and
source luminosity distance D are calculated analytically.
Derivatives of all other parameters (masses, spins, tidal
deformation, sky location, inclination angle, polarization
angle) are calculated numerically. The waveform phase
is a sum of terms with large and small values. Especially
the component 2πf tc can take very large numerical val-
ues, and gwfish eliminates this term in calculations of
numerical derivatives involving the phase of the wave-
form.

Another numerical challenge is connected to the inver-
sion of the Fisher matrix in equation (6) to obtain the PE
errors. The ﬁrst issue is that model parameters can have
a large range of numerical values, e.g., 1030 for masses in
kg and values of order 1 for all angular variables. The
situation can be ameliorated by normalizing the Fisher
matrix [35]:

matrix.

motions indicated by arrows.

instrument noise in the basic Michelson-type TDI combi-
nations is correlated, which means that it is convenient to
diagonalize the noise-correlation matrix, which yields the
three (noise) independent TDI channels A, E, T named
after the three scientists who set up the TDI formalism
for LISA (Armstrong, Estabrook, and Tinto). The T
channel has a strongly suppressed response to GWs be-
low f0 = c/(2L), where L is the average arm length of the
space detector. The channel T is the sum of the three
Michelson-type TDI channels, and it is known as null
stream in terrestrial GW detectors [33, 34]. The three in-
dependent channels A, E, T are simulated in gwfish for
space detectors. An approximation made in the calcula-
tion is that the so-called breathing motion of the space-
detector conﬁguration, i.e., a small modulation of the
arm lengths over the course of a year, is neglected. Cor-
recting the TDI combination for this eﬀect is important
for the suppression of laser-frequency noise, but it has a
small eﬀect on signal detection and PE. In other words,
the satellite conﬁguration is simulated as rigid body or-
biting the Sun and with a rotating detector plane known
as cartwheel motion [23].

The third detector type simulated in gwfish is LGWA,
which consists of an array of seismometers measuring the
surface displacement of the Moon produced by a pass-
ing GW. Here, the long-wavelength approximation ap-
plies again since the detector is designed for measure-
ments in the decihertz band and below, and the length
of the GWs need to be compared with the diameter of the
Moon. Therefore, the response of a seismometer to GWs
can again be described by equation (2), and the response
tensor takes the form

A = (cid:126)en ⊗ (cid:126)e1,

(4)

where (cid:126)e1 is the displacement direction measured by the
seismometer, and (cid:126)en is the surface normal vector at the
seismometer position. The time dependence of the re-

3. Invert the matrix, then repeat step (2) with the

A remaining potential numerical issue is when Fisher ma-
trices are close to degenerate. To address this issue, gw-
fish excludes all singular values lying below a certain
numeric precision threshold from the matrix before in-
verting it [36]. The main outcome of this step is to make
the matrix inversion robust with respect to all signiﬁcant
singular values containing physical information. In cases
where components of small singular values need to be dis-
carded, the waveform model is close to degenerate with
respect to at least one parameter pair, e.g., distance and
inclination angle can show strong correlations. The PE
errors estimated for such strongly correlated parameters
are typically substantially diﬀerent from PE errors com-
ing out of a full Bayesian analysis (posterior sampling).
For example, usage of prior distributions in Bayesian
analyses can substantially improve parameter estimates
in these cases. Model degeneracy is one of the fundamen-
tal failure modes of the Fisher-matrix analysis.

gwfish can use all waveform models of LALSimula-
tion [37], and it provides independent implementations
of the TaylorF2 (of 3.5th post-Newtonian order) and
IMRPhenomD approximants. It is beyond the scope of this
paper to provide a useful guideline for approximant us-
age with gwfish. Generally, it is important to under-
stand the physics that the LALSimulation approximant
incorporate, and these can have an enormous impact on
parameter estimation. For example, it should be clear
that for the analysis of high-mass or high-redshift BBH
signals, which appear only with several cycles in the ob-
servation band, an approximant like TaylorF2 is inap-
propriate since it does not include the merger and ring-
down of the binary. In these cases, the safest choice is to
use approximants that include higher-order modes. How-
ever, there are good use cases even for TaylorF2, e.g., if
one wants to calculate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
localization of binary neutron stars. It is recommended
to make comparison of results for a substantial random
sample of signals (of order 10 – 100 signals) before de-
ciding, whether it is safe to use a simpliﬁed waveform
model.

A. bilby versus gwfish

We compare SNRs and PE between bilby — a de-
tector simulation and Bayesian analysis software [38] —
and gwfish for four signals observed with ET (see Table
I). Due to current constraints imposed by bilby, and by
other state-of-the-art PE software, it is not possible to
carry out accurate Bayesian analysis of BNS signals for

4

ET. This has to do with computational limitations. Stan-
dard representations of BNS waveforms for ET would re-
quire about 108 samples due to the day-long observation
time of these signals with ET, and bilby also does not
consider Earth’s rotation during the observation of GW
signals for waveform modeling (an eﬀect that does not
play a role for analyses of compact binaries with cur-
rent GW detectors). As a consequence, we carry out our
comparison for BBHs, which, in some sense, is also more
interesting since model degeneracies play a more impor-
tant role. We do the comparison for each signal with
a random realization of the detector noise in bilby in
order to compare the gwfish results with a more realis-
tic simulation of the Bayesian analysis. However, while
noise realizations can generally inﬂuence PE errors [39],
it turns out that it has a negligible eﬀect here since the
SNRs of all signals are very high.

Signals 1 – 3 have randomly sampled angular param-
eters, while the fourth signal (Signal 3*) has the same
parameters as Signal 3 except for the two masses which
are the same as for Signal 1. The signals are at relatively
low redshift to make sure that the SNRs are high. In this
case, the Gaussian approximation of the likelihood func-
tion is expected to hold, but we will see, not entirely sur-
prisingly, that PE errors produced by gwfish and bilby
are still not identical. As for the detector, we employ ET
alone with its three components. For both bilby and
gwfish we are using the inspiral-merger-ringdown wave-
form IMRPhenomD from LALSimulation, setting the mini-
mum frequency to 10 Hz and the maximum frequency to
1024 Hz. For gwfish, we include results with 2 Hz lower
bound to show the impact of ET’s low-frequency sensitiv-
ity on PE. The reason not to use a 2 Hz lower bound for
waveforms in bilby is that bilby enforces a frequency
resolution of about 1/(duration of signal), which means
that the number of samples used for each waveform be-
comes very large even for BBHs with a 2 Hz lower bound
compared to 10 Hz. Consequently, it takes too long to
ﬁnish posterior sampling. In our analysis, we used a fre-
quency resolution of 1/153 Hz for Signal 1, 2 and 3, and
1/108 Hz for Signal 3*. A simpler waveform model such
as TaylorF2 would have been inappropriate here since
model degeneracies would be higher especially when sim-
ulating BBH observations involving only ET. SNR results
for these signals are summarized in table II. The SNRs
match between gwfish and bilby with expected minor
deviations, for example, because gwfish simulates the
eﬀects of the rotation of Earth on the waveform while
bilby does not.

For the comparison of PEs between bilby and gwfish,
we use the same signals of table I. Posterior sampling
requires to specify a prior on the parameters (at the very
least a uniform prior to constrain the reasonable/physical
range of parameter values). We used:

• uniform priors for mass ratio and chirp mass

• uniform prior for the polarization angle Ψ

The other 8 parameters (6 spin parameters, phase and
time) are given a delta prior and therefore are not taken
into consideration for posterior sampling and are ex-
cluded also from the Fisher matrices. bilby results are
obtained using the ’PEsummary’ package [40]. In table
III, we report the recovered median values for the param-
eters and the relative errors at the 90% conﬁdence level
for bilby. The parameter values reported for gwfish are
the true waveform parameters. gwfish outputs 1σ PE
errors, which are converted to the 90% conﬁdence level
in Table III, which can be done in Gaussian approxima-
tion by multiplying the errors by 1.645. Moreover, under
the gwfish results column, for each signal, we have two
results per parameter: the upper one is obtained using
fmin = 10 Hz, the lower one with fmin = 2 Hz. Starting

5

from 2 Hz yields smaller uncertainties on the parameters
by about a factor 2.

Generally, there is good agreement between gwfish
and bilby PE errors when taking gwfish results with
10 Hz low-frequency cutoﬀ. For example, mass errors
typically match within a factor 2. There are exceptions,
which are all connected to multi-modal posterior distri-
butions, e.g., several errors estimated with bilby are sig-
niﬁcantly larger since they include the contribution of a
second mode, which the Gaussian likelihood approxima-
tion cannot reproduce. Interesting to point out is that at
least for these 4 signals, which all have very high SNR,
ι, dL are both estimated well. This tells us that ET, as
suspected in the past due to its triangular conﬁguration,
is able to break the inclination-distance degeneracy. It
needs to be noted though that our small and high-SNR
sample of signals is not suﬃcient to draw general con-
clusions about ET PE capabilities, and errors might also
increase when spins, merger phase and time are included
in the analysis. What we can conclude from this table is
that correlations between model parameters do not nec-
essarily invalidate the gwfish PE errors, which means
that Fisher-matrix based analyses can produce useful es-
timates of PE errors.

Corner plots of the posterior samples with bilby are

shown in the appendix in Figures 6 to 9.

TaylorF2 versus IMRPhenomD versus IMRPhenomXPHM

Next, we compare results obtained with two approx-
imants: TaylorF2 (see [41] and [42]) and IMRPhenomD
(see [43] and [44]). The TaylorF2 model is the simplest
frequency-domain approximant, which describes the in-
spiral phase, and accurately only the early inspiral, which
is suﬃcient for estimates, e.g., of the chirp mass and BNS
localization through Earth’s rotation. We apply a high-
frequency cutoﬀ at 4 times the frequency of the innermost
stable circular orbit fisco = 6−1.5π−1c3/(GM ) to approx-
imately match the SNRs obtained with other waveform
models. The IMRPhenomD model extends over the full
inspiral-merger-ringdown of a compact-binary signal, but
there are still constraints on the physics described by
this model. For example, it only models the fundamen-
tal mode of the GW signal and systems with aligned
spins. The purpose of this comparison is to show how
a waveform model aﬀects parameter estimation, even at
the simple level of Fisher-matrix based error estimates.
To highlight the model diﬀerences we display in Fig-
ure 2 the normalized amplitudes for the two waveforms
for Signal 2 (see Table I) adjusted to units Hz−1/2 in
comparison also with the ET sensitivity curve. It can be
observed that the IMRPhenomD model shows the charac-
teristic bump towards the merger frequency and provides
a more natural cut oﬀ at high frequency.

To compare the two approximants, we start with 1000
BBH signals and 1000 BNS signals. We constrain the
BNS redshifts to a maximum of 0.4 so that the SNR

gwfish column presents two results for each parameter: the upper one is obtained starting from fmin = 10 Hz, the one below
is obtained starting from a minimum frequency of 2 Hz. The parameter values reported for gwfish are the true waveform
parameters, while the values reported for bilby are the median values of the posterior distribution.

of the PE errors recovered for each of the parameters
with TaylorF2 and IMRPhenomD as histograms over the
detected signals. The BBH results are in gray, while the
BNS ones are plotted in red. The upper graph shows the
ratio of SNRs, while the other histograms show the ratio
of the uncertainties on the other parameters. For BBH
systems, the PE errors of the individual masses are un-
derestimated with TaylorF2 (assuming that IMRPhenomD
generally yields more accurate results), while all other
parameters considered here are weakly biased towards
larger errors compared to IMRPhenomD. For BNS signals
there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two consid-
ered approximants: the SNRs are coincident, and only
the sky-localisation errors are slightly underestimated
with TaylorF2.

We show a similar analysis for the IMRPhenomXPHM
and IMRPhenomD approximants. The IMRPhenomXPHM ap-
proximant can describe precession (not considered in this
study) and higher-order modes. The latter is well-known
to have important consequences for BBH analyses (see,
e.g., [45, 46]). Here, a signiﬁcant improvement of PE can
also be seen for a signiﬁcant fraction of BNS signals. For
about 5% of BNS, the sky-localization error is signiﬁ-
cantly reduced by up to a factor 5 using IMRPhenomXPHM.
For about 10% of BNS, the distance error is signiﬁcantly
reduced by up to a few orders of magnitude. What this
means is that some BNS signals show strong correlations
in the likelihood between distance and inclination angle
using IMRPhenomD, and the higher-order modes described
with IMRPhenomXPHM lead to a suppression of these cor-
relations.

distributions for BBHs and BNSs are similar. From
these, 927 BBH and 966 BNS signals are seen with a
minimum SNR of 8.0 using TaylorF2, IMRPhenomD, or
IMRPhenomXPHM LALSimulation approximants. The dis-
tribution of SNR values of detected signals goes up to 200
peaking at 20. The signals are analyzed with a frequency
resolution of 1/32 Hz. The analysis is carried out with
ET alone over a frequency range from 2 Hz to 1024 Hz.
The results are shown in Figure 3. We plot the ratios

detectors. With respect to its PE capabilities, three
features stand out, which will make it a unique facility
among future detectors:

• It has the geometry of an equilateral triangle and
laser-interferometer arms launching from each of its
vertices. It is expected that this triangular conﬁgu-
ration will give it unique capabilities concerning the
measurement of GW polarizations and parameters

• It will have 10 km arm length, which, together with
several technology improvements with respect to
current detectors, leads to a greatly improved peak
sensitivity by about a factor 10. Binaries of com-
pact objects will be detected along the cosmic his-
tory; BNS and BBH mergers are both expected to
be detected with a rate of 105 per year. The enor-
mous increase of SNR for close events will enable
accurate parameter estimation, enabling great pre-
cision in GW astronomy.

• It will consist of a total of 3 pairs of laser interfer-
ometers. Each pair includes a low-frequency inter-
ferometer and a high-frequency interferometer to-
gether covering an observation band from 3 Hz to
several kHz. The observation is thus extended to
much lower frequencies compared to current GW
detectors, which leads to longer observation times
of individual compact-binary signals, and it will
also make it possible to observe larger-mass com-
pact binaries well into the regime of intermediate-
mass black-hole binaries. Long observation times
enable stand-alone sky-location measurements by
ET of neutron-star binaries exploiting amplitude
modulations due to Earth’s rotation. Due to the
fact that the observed mass is the redshifted source-
frame mass, i.e., multiplication by (1 + z), the low-
frequency sensitivity will make it possible to access
BBH mergers in the early Universe where primor-
dial BHs can be discriminated from BHs with stel-
lar origin [e.g. 47, 48].

In the following, we present a few reference PE results
obtained from gwfish, which can be used for compar-
ison with other simulation software. We focus on sky-
localization results, since these are more diﬃcult to simu-
late accurately. A single detector can accurately localize
a GW source if the observation is long enough so that
the motion of the detector leads to amplitude and phase
modulations of GW signals, which depend on the direc-
tion of the source. This is the case for BNSs, which are
observed for several hours with ET. Even lighter NSBHs
and BBHs can be localized this way by ET. For speciﬁc
signals as well as for the average localization by Earth ro-
tation, the localization errors depend on the latitude of
the GW detector. Sky-localization is greatly improved if
additional detectors are present to form a network. In the
latter case, the information comes from measurements of
phase diﬀerences between signals observed in diﬀerent
detectors (standard triangulation technique) [49].

We show in Figure 5 the sky-localization results for
BNSs as 90% credible region. The results are presented
as fraction of signals localized within a certain area in the
sky. BNSs are considered at various ﬁxed luminosity dis-
tances; 1000 BNS per curve. The BNS masses are set to
1.4+1.4M(cid:12). The plots conﬁrm that ET has unique sky-
localization capabilities for BNSs, which would enable

8

multi-messenger studies without the need of other detec-
tors, but it is also clear that the localization capabilities
of a network are far superior even if only one other detec-
tor like Cosmic Explorer (CE) is added. Nearer systems
are better localized and the network of ET+2CE man-
ages to localize almost all of the injected signals within
10 deg2. We ﬁnd our results to be consistent with previ-
ously published results, e.g., [15, 50].

Next, we present an analysis of the 85 signals of
GWTC-3 [52–54]. Only the merger time, masses and
distance were taken from the catalogue. Angular param-
eters were drawn randomly, spins were set to zero. Ob-
servation of these signals with ET was simulated. The
simulation was done for 10 realizations of the angular
waveform parameters for each signal. Table IV provides
a summary of the median SNRs and sky-localization
that would have been achieved with ET. The table only
contains the signals whose sky-localization was within
1000 deg2 for all random realizations of the angular
variables of the waveform. As expected, these signals
are among the lowest-mass systems in GWTC-3, which
means that ET would have observed them for a long time.

TABLE IV. Median SNRs and sky-localization errors for
simulated observations of GWTC-3 signals with ET. Only
masses, merger times, and distances were taken from GWTC-
3. The sky-localization errors were evaluated for several ran-
dom realizations, and only the signals with error < 1000 deg2
for all realizations are shown in the table. The waveform
used here is IMRPhenomXPHM to include the potentially impor-
tant higher-order modes, but for the signals reported in the
table, the sky-localization results would have been the same
using TaylorF2 or IMRPhenomD. The localization even of larger
BBHs can be < 100 deg2, but it depends strongly on the val-
ues of angular parameters.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have presented gwfish; a new Fisher-
matrix code to investigate parameter-estimation capabil-
ities of future GW detectors. gwfish stands out as a
robust and ﬂexible detector simulation software:

• It implements modeling of the so-called A, E, T
channels of LISA-type space-borne detectors, of

LGWA, and of triangular and L-shape terrestrial
GW detectors;

• It can use all LALSimulation approximants sup-
porting precession as well as tidal deformation;

• It incorporates the motion of detectors, e.g., be-
cause of Earth/Moon rotation, or the orbits of
satellites around the Sun, and it simulates the cor-
responding amplitude and phase modulations of
GW signals;

• It can simulate multi-band observations;

• It takes several measures to reduce the impact of

numerical errors on Fisher-matrix PE errors.

Certain analyses are currently not possible with state-of-
the-art detector simulation and Bayesian analysis soft-
ware like bilby due to practical constraints on available
computational resources. For example, if hundreds of
thousands of GW signals need to be analyzed, sometimes
repeatedly to study the eﬀect of changes in population
or waveform models, then Fisher-matrix codes like gw-
fish are the best option. Important is to understand the
limitations of Gaussian approximations of the likelihood.
We have shown a few comparisons in this article between
bilby and gwfish, and we generally ﬁnd a good match
between the two with exceptions that can be explained.
In the cases studied here, discrepancies emerged when
multiple modes of the posterior distribution contributed
signiﬁcantly to the PE errors. Tighter priors would sig-
niﬁcantly reduce the mismatch.

We also investigated the impact of the choice of
waveform model,
i.e., TaylorF2 vs IMRPhenomD vs
IMRPhenomXPHM. For BBH signals, all three approximants
produce signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results. For the BNS anal-
yses presented here, namely SNR and sky-localization,
TaylorF2 vs IMRPhenomD produce almost identical re-
sults. However, for a signiﬁcant fraction of BNS signals,
PE errors with IMRPhenomXPHM are signiﬁcantly reduced
compared to IMRPhenomD. The reduction is strongest for

distance errors (10% of signals signiﬁcantly aﬀected), be-
cause distance errors can be strongly correlated with er-
rors of the inclination angle. The IMRPhenomXPHM ap-
proximant takes signiﬁcantly longer to evaluate than
TaylorF2 and IMRPhenomD (the latter two with similar
evaluation times) when using the LALSimulation package
with Python/SWIG [55]. We conclude that the choice of
approximant is generally more important for BBH anal-
yses. For BNS signals, broad population studies can still
be carried out with IMRPhenomD or TaylorF2, but results
especially for distance and inclination errors are more
reliable for a signiﬁcant fraction of signals when using
IMRPhenomXPHM. Needless to say, it always depends on
the type of analysis one wants to perform whether a cer-
tain waveform model is adequate or not. Considering
precession and higher-order modes might be negligible
eﬀects in some analyses, and crucial in others. The gw-
fish user must be familiar with the characteristics of the
standard waveform models.

The scientiﬁc results presented in this paper conﬁrm
the long-standing claim that the triangular conﬁguration
of ET makes it possible to measure GW polarizations and
thereby break certain model degeneracies. For example,
for high-SNR BBH signals, we found that the inclination
angle is measured precisely with ET, which also improves
the estimates of source distance. We leave it for a fu-
ture analysis whether this ability extends to lower-SNR
signals, which could be of great beneﬁt for cosmological
studies. We also found that ET itself would have esti-
mated the sky location of the low-mass GWTC-3 signals
to within 100 deg2 at 90% conﬁdence (depending on the
exact sky location, the localization of GW170817 can be
within 1 deg2). This shows that multi-messenger astron-
omy with ET as sole GW detector is possible, but un-
locking the full potential of multi-messenger astronomy
with GWs would require at least another GW detector
with a similar sensitivity.
