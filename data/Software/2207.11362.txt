ABSTRACT

The Roman coronagraph instrument will demonstrate high-contrast imaging technology, enabling the imaging
of faint debris disks, the discovery of inner dust belts, and planets. Polarization studies of debris disks provide
information on dust grains’ size, shape, and distribution. The Roman coronagraph uses a polarization module
comprising two Wollaston prism assemblies to produce four orthogonally polarized images (I0, I90, I45, and
I135), each measuring 3.2 arcsecs in diameter and separated by 7.5 arcsecs in the sky. The expected RMS
error in the linear polarization fraction measurement is 1.66% per resolution element of 3 by 3 pixels. We
present a mathematical model to simulate the polarized intensity images through the Roman CGI, including
the instrumental polarization and other uncertainties. We use disk modeling software, MCFOST, to model q,
u, and polarization intensity of the debris disk, Epsilon-Eridani. The polarization intensities are convolved with
the coronagraph throughput incorporating the PSF morphology. We include model uncertainties, detector noise,
speckle noise, and jitter. The ﬁnal polarization fraction of 0.4±0.0251 is obtained after the post-processing.

1. INTRODUCTION

Debris disks are predominantly made of dust and planetesimals and are found to be an integral part of the
evolution of the planetary systems.1, 2 The Asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt form the debris disk of our
solar system along with the zodiacal dust.3 Debris disks may be polarized due to Rayleigh/Mie scattering by
dust particles or asymmetry or the dichroic extinction of the dust grains in the presence of magnetic ﬁelds.
Polarization observations of debris disks enable us to constrain their structure and properties of the dust grains
such as composition, size, shape, and distribution.4–7 Polarization observation of several debris disks has been
carried out using the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI)8 at the Gemini Telescope, and SPHERE-ZIMPOL9 at the
Very Large Telescope (VLT) in the near IR wavelengths. Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys
coronograph has been used to observe the polarization of a few debris disks (HD61005,10 and AU Mic11) in the
Johnson-Cousins V band ﬁlter. The multi-band polarization observations will allow us to constrain better the
dust properties and disk structure of the debris disks.

The upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Coronograph instrument (CGI) will facilitate the po-
larization observations of fainter debris disks (reaching contrast level of ∼ 10−8) around the nearby stars in
addition to the high-contrast and high-resolution imaging of exoplanets. The polarimetric module consists of
two Wollaston prisms, each producing two orthogonally polarized images, separated by 7.5” on the sky. The
imaging polarimetry is available for the narrow ﬁeld (525nm), and wide-ﬁeld (825nm) modes.12 In this paper,
we describe a mathematical model for simulating the polarization observations of debris disk through the Roman
CGI. In our simulations, we have considered the debris disk around a nearby (early) sun-like star, Epsilon Eridani
((cid:15) Eridani).

The next section provides an overview of the mathematical model and a snapshot of each stage’s results. The
following sections describe each step in the mathematical model with the corresponding outputs. Finally, the
conclusions and future work are presented in the discussion section.

2. MATHEMATICAL MODEL

In this section, we describe the overview of the mathematical model developed for the simulation of polarization
observation of debris disk Epsilon-Eridani as shown in Figure 1. First, the disk is modeled using MCFOST
to obtain the scattered light intensity and Stokes parameters. Next, the disk intensities are convolved with
the Roman CGI PSF obtained using the PROPER models. Further, the EMCCD photon counted images are
generated, including the EMCCD gain and noise characteristics. Next, we add the speckle and jitter noise using
Os9 simulations of Roman CGI and perform disk extraction. The ﬁnal step is the estimation of Stokes parameters
and corresponding errors after multiplying the instrument Mueller matrix. Each stage of this model is described
in the following sections.

3. MODELLING OF EPSILON-ERIDANI IN MCFOST

Epsilon Eridani is a star similar to the early sun; at a distance of 3.2pc with T=5100K, Mass=0.82M(cid:12) and
Radius= 0.88R(cid:12). The debris disk around (cid:15) Eridani has been observed at multiple wavelengths, yet, the disk
parameters and details of the structure are debatable. The debris disk has been detected as an unresolved
excess around the star with two or three components: a warm inner disk with ∼ two narrow belts according to
Su et. al(2017)13 (that has not yet been resolved) and a cold outer disk imaged with both ALMA14 and other
Sub-millimeter instruments.15, 16

The Roman CGI is expected to resolve the innermost disk around (cid:15) Eridani and provide clarity regarding the
size and location of the inner disk. We have used the disk parameters and dust composition from Su et.al(2017)13
to model the inner disk of the (cid:15) Eridani. The parameters provided in Table 1 are used in MCFOST to obtain
the scattered light and Stokes parameters (for linear polarization: q, and u) images at a wavelength of 575nm
and inclination of 34°. We used a 20.8 mas/pixel scale with 256×256 pixels and the Mie scattering model to
account for the polarization. The scattered light images and Stokes parameters are shown in Figures 2 and 3
respectively.

The scattered light brightness and p and θ are used to obtain the four intensities (I0, I90,I45 and I135) as

below:

I0 = N srct ∗ (1 + p ∗ cos(2 ∗ θ))/2
I45 = N srct ∗ (1 + p ∗ sin(2 ∗ θ))/2

I90 = N srct ∗ (1 − p ∗ cos(2 ∗ θ))/2
I135 = N srct ∗ (1 − p ∗ sin(2 ∗ θ))/2

(1)

(2)

where N srct correspond to the total number of photons.The four intensities are shown in Figure 4. These
intensities are then convolved with the Roman CGI PSFs as explained in the next section.

4. GENERATING ROMAN PSFS

Point Response Functions (PRFs) are generated for the Hybrid Lyot Coronograph mode at 575nm with a ﬁeld
of view of 0.14”-0.45” using PROPER model of the Roman CGI. We set the polarization axis as the mean of all
polarization modes in the PROPER model (polaxis=10). Convolution is done via a matrix-vector multiplication
in a process utilizing the PRFs of ﬁeld angles for each pixel in the disk model array.17

This
is illustrated in Figure 5 with the distribution of PRFs used for the HLC. Finally, PRFs beyond the OWA are
included to incorporate the scattering of light from regions of the disk outside the OWA. The disk images of I0,
I90, I45, and I135 are shown in Figure 6 after convolving with the Roman PSFs.

5. EMCCD SIMULATION

The Roman CGI will use e2v CCD201-20 which is a back-illuminated electron-multiplying CCD sensor consisting
of 1024× 1024 pixels of 13µm in size. It can be operated in low gain (<1000) and high gain (>1000) mode. To
convert the disk polarization intensities to photo electrons EMCCD detect18 is used. We simulate a stack of 50
EMCCD frames for each of the intensity component with an exposure time=5s/frame, gain=800 incorporating
bias=10000e−, dark current =0.0028, e−/pix/s, read noise=100 e−. Figure 7 shows one of the frames at the
EMCCD for all the four polarization intensities.

6. DISK EXTRACTION AND ESTIMATING STOKES PARAMETERS

The integrated modeling team at JPL creates Observing Scenario simulations to generate the simulated science
data for the HLC and SPC coronographs using the most recent version of the observation strategy. OS9 is the
ninth public release of Roman post-coronagraph simulated science images, which includes end-to-end Structural
Thermal Optical Performance (STOP) model of the Roman observatory, coronagraph masks, diﬀraction, wave-
front control, and detector noise and also jitter. We perform the disk processing, and extraction technique as
explained in Douglas et. al(2022).19 The photon-counting procedure is operated on all the intensity images with
a threshold of 1.1*readnoise, following the steps from N emati(2020).18 We include optical model uncertainty
factors (MUFs) in our analysis obtained from the OS9 repository. Although we use the Non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF) method20 to subtract the PSF components while performing disk extraction, we can obtain
the required SNR without using the NMF as well. Figure 8 shows the unprocessed coronographic images with
and without disk and post-processed disk with NMF speckle subtraction for one of the polarization intensity
components. Once the photon counted images are obtained for all the four intensity components, the Stokes
parameters and corresponding errors are estimated as follows:21

where, I0◦ , I90◦ , I45◦ , I135◦ are the four intensities in polarized beams and σI0◦ , σI90◦ , σI45◦ , σI135◦ are correspond-
ing uncertainties. Although all the instrument eﬀects are considered in the PSF convolution and OS9 simulations,
we have not incorporated the polarization changes introduced by the Roman telescope and instrument optics.
Any optical component in the system can either introduce or modify the incoming source polarization causing in-
strumental polarization, or polarization crosstalk.22, 23 These eﬀects can be accounted for using the 4×4 Mueller
matrix of the system, as explained in the next section.

7. MUELLER MATRIX OF THE CGI INSTRUMENT AND ESTIMATING FINAL
STOKES PARAMETERS

The pupil averaged Mueller matrices obtained from IPAC for wavelength 450-950nm is shown in Figure 9. We
use the Mueller matrix for 575nm to obtain the ﬁnal Stokes parameters as shown:

where q(cid:48) and u(cid:48) are the stokes parameters obtained after the disk extraction. For measurement of linear polar-

q = M 21 + M 22 ∗ q(cid:48) + M 23 ∗ u(cid:48)

The sign of q is found to be ﬂipped due to the Mueller matrix element M 21. We recover all the Stokes parameters
and the polarization fraction after incorporating various error factors in the Roman CGI.

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

We have presented a mathematical model to simulate polarization simulation of any debris disk through the
Roman CGI. As an example, we have modeled the inner ring of the debris disk around Epsilon-Eridani. Various
instrument errors, noise, and polarization eﬀects have been accounted for, and we have recovered the input
polarization fraction of 0.4±0.025. The error (2.5% per pixel) in the polarization fraction measurement is
comparable to the expected RMS error for the Roman CGI. Also, this accuracy may suﬃce for the polarimetry
of disks in general, as the linear polarization fraction of disks is in the order of percent to several tens of percent
compared to the other stellar objects. However, the achievable measurement accuracy depends on how well
the instrument can be calibrated to correct for various polarimetric errors introduced by the instrument optics.
Hence a detailed polarization calibration strategy is required for planning the observations of polarized and
unpolarized standard stars and performing the required polarization corrections using those observations.24, 25

The MCFOST model for Epsilon-Eridani is simulated using a single grain composition. We would model the
disk by varying dust grain sizes, shapes, and compositions and obtain the wavelength dependence of scattering
polarization.26 This analysis will enable us to understand how well the disk properties can be constrained using
multi-band polarization measurements.
