Benoit Baudry and Martin Monperrus
Exhaustive Survey of Rickrolling in
Academic Literature

Abstract: Rickrolling is an Internet cultural phenomenon born in the mid
2000s. Originally confined to Internet fora, it has spread to other channels and
media. In this paper, we hypothesize that rickrolling has reached the formal aca-
demic world. We design and conduct a systematic experiment to survey rickrolling
in the academic literature. As of March 2022, there are 23 academic documents
intentionally rickrolling the reader. Rickrolling happens in footnotes, code listings,
references. We believe that rickrolling in academia proves inspiration and face-
tiousness, which is healthy for good science. This original research suggests areas
of improvement for academic search engines and calls for more investigations about
academic pranks and humor.

1 Introduction

“It looks like there aren’t many great
matches for your search”, Google
Search Message

Rickrolling consists of hiding facetious links on the Internet pointing to a
specific Youtube video: the video clip of “Never Gonna Give You Up” by singer
Rick Astley. The interested reader can watch the preparatory material at https:
//youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ.

Rickrolling is a massive cultural phenomenon. It has appeared on the Internet
in the mid 2000s reaching all countries with an exponential growth. Rickrolling

has contributed to the staggering number of views of Rick Astley’s Youtube video,
1.17 billion at the time of writing.

In this survey, we address an open research question: has rickrolling rippled
beyond Internet chatting platforms? In particular, we hypothesize that rickrolling
reached some formal circles, including the academic world of peer reviewed articles,
formally edited books and seriously examined theses. To study this important
question, we follow a rigorous method, articulated around two steps, in order to
survey rickrolling in the academic literature (section 2).

Our results are clearcut: as of March 11 2022, there are 34 academic documents
with a mention to Rick Astley’s video. In this paper, we exhaustively study them,
one by one, to identify the intent and form of the rickrolling (section 3).

We find that: 1) rickrolling is present in the academic literature, with 23
academic documents intentionally rickrolling the reader; 2) rickrolling is mostly
done in Master’s and PhD thesis; 3) rickrolling is performed in majority in the
field of information technology. Our study also uncovers some essential challenges
for engineering academic search engine engines (section 4).

2 Methodology

The survey is performed per the state of the art of literature reviews. In this
section, we document our experimental methodology.

2.1 Research Questions

Our survey is articulated around 4 research questions
– RQ1. How many unique academic publications refer to the video clip of Rick

Astley’s song “Never Gonna Give You Up”?

– RQ2. How many of these academic publications refer to Rick Astley’s video

clip with the intention of rickrolling their readers?

– RQ3. What is the nature of the academic publications that rickroll?
– RQ4. How is the rickroll integrated into the publication?

2.2 Data Collection

The systematic methodology that we rigorously follow is structured in 2 steps.

First, we identify the canonical rickroll url. For this, we enter one single query
in Youtube’s search engine: “rick astley never gonna give you up” and collect the
most viewed URL, which is https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ.

Second, we make one single query in Google Scholar to query all the doc-
uments referenced by this single academic search engine containling the term
“dQw4w9WgXcQ”: scholar.google.com/?q=dQw4w9WgXcQ. This query has been done
on Friday 11 March 2022, at 15h02, from a Swedish IP, in Konstfack, Stockholm.
The replication package is available on Github at replication-package-exhaustive-
systematic-review-rickrolling.

Tab. 1: Exhaustive Data Analysis of the Rickrolling Academic Literature. 1 means that the
Google Scholar title metadata was wrong, and fixed in this table.

3 Experimental Results

Table 1 provides the exhaustive list of academic documents that refer to the
Youtube video of “Never Gonna Give you Up”. The references appear in the order
given by Google Scholar, in our research-oriented web browsers.

For each document, the first column gives the bibliographic reference. The
second column provides the title of the document, as well as a note about the
intention behind the presence of the Youtube url. The intention can either be
rickrolling, or a legitimate usage of the url, e.g., in the case of academic studies
that analyze Internet’s culture. The third column is the publication type and the
fourth the publication year.

RQ1 (Prevalence) Per the data collected on March 11 2022, at 15h02,
Google Scholar knows 34 documents containing an explicit mention to the Youtube
URL for “Never Gonna Give You Up”. With manual analysis, we identify that
two URLs are duplicate. This results in exactly 33 verified documents containing
“dQw4w9WgXcQ”.

RQ2 (Intention) Among the 33 documents, there are 10 articles for which
the appearance of the Youtube link is legit, as part of a discussion about rickrolling
or Internet memes. Based on a careful manual assessment, we confirm that there
are 24 academic documents for which the intention is clearly to rickroll the reader,
with no relationship between the topic of the document and the link. This means
that rickrolling is significantly more practiced (33x) than studied (10x) in the
academic literature.

RQ3 (Publication type) The references to the Youtube link are essentially
present in academic theses. We found a total of 22 theses among the 33 documents
surveyed in this work, which are distributed as follows: 5 PhD, 11 MSc, 6 BSc
theses. The other references appear in 4 books, 2 reports and 5 articles. We also
note that rickrolling in the academic literature is a rather new phenomenon, with
only 8 references before 2017, while 25 references have appeared in the last 5
years. The recent growth of rickrolling in the academic literature, combined with
a majority of references in theses, likely reflect a generational movement: the BSc
and MSc students from the late 2020’ were teenagers at the boom of rickrolling in
the end of the 2010’s.

RQ4 (Rickroll form) Per our manual analysis, we are able to create a tax-

onomy of rickrolling forms.

text 1, it is natural to use footnotes as a place for rickrolling. For example, footnote
36, page 52 of [27] reads “The original Star Trek series (1966–69) also proclaims
space as the final frontier in its opening credits. See https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ”.
Code We have seen a number of rickroling cases planted in code listings. For exam-
ple, Zetterlund et al. [4] rickroll in a JSON listing, which we reproduce in Listing 1,
with permission.
URL When one needs an example URL or a metasyntactic link, it is a good op-
portunity to rickroll. For example, Hagen takes the innocuous example “when user
‘@salhagen1’ references the link ‘https://www.youtube.com/dQw4w9WgXcQ’ two
times or more, we only kept the most-liked instance.” [16].
References Finally, one can hide rickrolling links in a reference [28]. For example,
the last reference of Helle’s master’s thesis is a fake rickrolling reference [34].

4 Discussion

4.1 Threats to Validity

Our measurement of rickrolling is sound but conservative. Not all rickrolling in-
stances can be found with the Youtube identifier.

First Rick Astley’s video clip was released in 1987 and, 4chan, where rickrolling
likely was born, went online in 2003. We may miss early rickrolling that predates
Youtube (2005).

Second, there are many copycats and remixes of “Never Gonna Give You Up”
on Youtube. It is clear that some rickrolling documents refer to another URL than
the canonical one.

Third, some academic documents rickroll with an implicit hyperlink, where
the target of the hyperlink does not appear in text. In that case, Google Scholar
does not index the document under the rickrolling identifier, and thus does not
return it for the query under consideration in this survey. To our knowledge, there
is no publicly available way to overcome this. Only a Googler with internal access
to the database could be able to see the actual rickrolling hypergraph.

4.2 Limitations of Indexing

We note that not all academic search engines are equal. For the same request with
the “dQw4w9WgXcQ” Youtube video identifier, the IEEE academic search engine
yields no result, and the ACM academic search engine returns a single paper [14].
This means that Google Scholar is far better at indexing rare terms.

We speculate that academic indexing at IEEE and ACM is limited to known
terms from a predefined dictionary, with some stemming. This is a real limitation.
Beyond rickrolling there are many use cases for search for rare terms. For example,
researchers may search for rare protein or asteroid identifiers: this may not be
supported by IEEE or ACM. For such use cases, Google Scholar provides a great
service to science by indexing arbitrary terms.

Google Scholar is not perfect though. In our study, we have identified two
shortcomings in Google Scholar: 1) properly handling subtitles to deduplicate doc-
uments 2) properly identifying whether theses are master’s thesis or PhD thesis.
This hinders the soundness and completeness of all systematic literature reviews
based on Google Scholar. In this paper, we address these shortcomings through a
complete, thorough manual check of all documents.

Last but bot least, as stated in the threats to validity, a useful feature of an
academic search engine is missing, even in the best-of-breed Google Scholar: let
users search for all documents with an hyperlink to a particular URL, or with a
term contained in that hyperlink. This information is most certainly available in
Google’s database but is not exposed in their public API.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented the first ever study of rickrolling in the academic
literature. Although rickrolling in academia remains confidential, it is clearly an
inspiring force for students and scholars alike. This is evidenced by a significant
growth of rickrolling in the last 5 years. Seriously, our research highlights limita-
tions in academic search engine indexing and querying. We call for an action from
IEEE and ACM to better index rare terms. Meanwhile, Google Scholar should
provide a way to query the hyperlink graph embedded in academic documents.

Future work is required to fully understand the rickrolling phenomenon. For
instance, preliminary inquiry suggests that it is used as fake persona homepages2.
And we leave for future work to survey the academic literature on “Dance Dance
Authentication” 3.
