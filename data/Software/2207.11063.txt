ABSTRACT

Open clusters serve as a useful tool for calibrating models of the relationship between mass, rotation, and age for stars with an outer
convection zone due to the homogeneity of the stars within the cluster. Cluster to cluster comparisons are essential to determine
whether the universality of spindown relations holds. NGC 6709 is selected as a young open cluster for which no rotation periods of
members have previously been obtained. This cluster is at a distance of over 1 kpc and has two red giant members. Isochrones place
the age of the cluster at around 150 Myr, or approximately the same age as the Pleiades. Photometry is obtained over a multi-month
observing season at the robotic observatory STELLA. After basic processing, PSF photometry was derived using Daophot II, and a
suite of related software allowed us to create time series of relative magnitude changes for each star. Four time series analysis methods
are then applied to these light curves to obtain rotation periods for members stars. We obtain for the ﬁrst time rotation periods for
45 FGK cluster members of NGC 6709. We compare our rotation periods to Gaia EDR3 colors and ﬁnd a slow-rotating sequence
with increasing rotation periods towards redder stars and a smaller clump of rapid rotators that have not yet joined this sequence.
NGC 6709 has rotation periods very similar to that of another Pleiades-age open cluster, NGC 2516.

1. Introduction

The rotation periods of cool stars, both in open clusters and in the
ﬁeld, have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Not
only does the rotation period provide the basic observable that
governs the activity properties of cool stars, but it can also be
measured very precisely. Furthermore, the rotation period distri-
butions evince patterns (e.g., Barnes 2003) that inform us about
internal processes in stars or even their ages (e.g., Skumanich
1972; Barnes 2007). Open clusters are particularly valuable as
calibrating objects, or more generally because they oﬀer us ho-
mogeneous sample of coeval stars of the same composition. This
paper contributes to that eﬀort by presenting a newly determined
rotation period distribution for a hitherto unstudied young open
cluster NGC 6709.

The Sun is not unique as a star, and so the physics of the
solar-wind and angular momentum of the Sun in studies by those
such as Parker (1958) and Weber & Davis (1967) can be applied
to stars. A star after formation should spin down as angular mo-
mentum is lost from the interactions of the stellar winds with
magnetic ﬁelds (e.g., Mestel 1968). This tendency for older stars
√t, or Skumanich’s law
to spin slower takes the form of P(m)
(Skumanich 1972). Much work has been done recently to reﬁne
and calibrate this law, both through theoretical models and obser-
vations. From this law comes the idea that if one could calculate
a star’s rotation period based on its age, then one could also work
backwards and obtain the age of a star from its rotation, known
as gyrochronology (Barnes 2003). Gyrochronology is the rela-
tionship between a stellar rotation period P, the mass of the star
M and the age of the star T .

∝

Early measurements of stellar rotation predating large-
format CCDs used the v sin i from spectroscopy (e.g., Gaige
1993). Modern observing techniques allow more more precise
and unambiguous measurements of the rotation period via pho-
tometric changes. Thus, the most eﬃcient way of observing the

rotation rates of stars is through changes in brightness in a time
series of observations of an object. Kron (1947) initially ob-
served periodic changes in light curves due to large, cool star
spots. FGKM stars have an outer convection zone, and the sup-
pression of convection from the magnetic ﬁeld causes a cool spot
to form, analogous to the sunspots. As these spots rotate across
the line of sight, a dip in the stellar brightness may be observed
(e.g., Strassmeier 2009). Since starspots are thought to last at
least the order of a few months, the stellar rotation can then be
extracted from a time series of observations of a star’s bright-
ness.

Open clusters provide a rich laboratory for observing stel-
lar rotation. Cluster members can be considered largely homo-
geneous in chemical composition and age (e.g., De Silva et al.
2006), and so observing the rotation rates of the FGK stars
(and M-dwarfs where possible) can provide information about
the mass relationship with the rotation period. Furthermore, the
age of the open cluster can be determined by other independent
methods such as isochrones and measurements of the chromo-
spheric ﬂux Barnes (2007). Open clusters can therefore serve
to calibrate the age-mass-rotation relationship essentially to gy-
rochronology. This method of using individual open clusters as
snapshots of stellar rotation at a single age only holds if all clus-
ters of a similar age and metallicity show a similar distribution
in rotation periods. Cluster to cluster comparisons then become
essential to this theory.

One benchmark candidate for young open clusters around
the age 125 Myr is the well-studied Pleiades at a distance of
133 pc (e.g., Hartman et al. 2010),. This cluster, along with the
Hyades (e.g., Delorme et al. 2011), was used to derive the Sku-
manich’s law for the evolution of rotation for solar-type stars.
Fritzewski et al. (2020) (hereafter F20) compares the rotation
rates of members of four other Pleiades-age clusters and ﬁnds
that all behave similarly.

NGC 6709 is selected as one of the fainter of the possi-
ble Pleiades-age clusters with no previous observations of ro-
tation rates of member stars. Several membership studies are
available in literature relying on either spectroscopic or proper
motion membership determination methods (Hakkila et al.
1983; Tadross 2001; Dias et al. 2001; Kharchenko et al. 2004;
Vande Putte et al. 2010; Kharchenko et al. 2013; Dias et al.
2014; Sampedro et al. 2017; Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018). It has
two red giant members (Lindoﬀ 1968; Sears & Sowell 1997;
Ahumada & Lapasset 2007; Mermilliod et al. 2008), possible
Be stars (Schild & Romanishin 1976; Subramaniam & Sagar
1999), and possible blue stragglers (Ahumada & Lapasset
2007). One of
the red giants is a spectroscopic binary
(Mermilliod et al. 2007) and the other is a possible member of
a quadruple star system (Smiljanic et al. 2018).

The above-1000 pc distance and consequent faintness of
the cluster has led some disparity in adopted parameters due
to the diﬃculty in observing the cluster, although with the
advent of Gaia, these values have been more in agreement
in recent publications. Values for
V
range from 0.28–0.35 (Johnson et al. 1961; Becker 1963;
Burki 1975; Mermilliod 1981; Subramaniam & Sagar 1999;

Piskunov et al. 2007; Kharchenko et al. 2013;
Joshi et al.
2016; Sampedro et al. 2017). Distance estimates range from
930–1253 pc (Johnson et al. 1961; Hoag & Applequist 1965;
Lindoﬀ 1968; Burki 1975; Mermilliod 1981; Hakkila et al.
1983; Barkhatova et al. 1987; Lynga & Palous 1987; Leisawitz

2001; Loktin & Beshenov 2003; Kharchenko et al. 2005;
Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018).

Age estimates based on various methods of isochrone
ﬁtting in literature have ranged from 65 Myr to 320 Myr.
Earlier studies of NGC 6709 tend to obtain ages of less
than 80 Myr (Lindoﬀ 1968; Burki 1975; Mermilliod 1981;
Barkhatova et al. 1989) or older than 200 Myr (Barbaro et al.
1969; Sagar & Subramaniam 1999; Subramaniam & Sagar
1999), possibly due to instrument limitations at the time and the
distance to NGC 6709. More recent studies place the age around
(Tadross 2001; Lata et al. 2002; Chen et al.
100–190 Myr
2003; Kharchenko et al. 2005; Ahumada & Lapasset 2007;
Wu et al. 2009; Vande Putte et al. 2010; Smiljanic et al. 2018;
Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2020; Bossini et al. 2019).

Radial velocity measurements have only been obtained for a
few member stars, including the red giant members. Hence, there
is some degree of uncertainty and published values range from

This work is part of the STELLA Open Cluster Survey
(SOCS). The survey observes multiple open clusters over peri-
ods of several months to obtain rotation curves. The objective is
to establish the similarities between open clusters of similar ages
as well as track the evolution of rotation periods over time with
clusters of diﬀerent ages (e.g., Fügner et al. 2011; Barnes et al.
2015).

2. Methods

In outline, to derive rotation periods for stars in NGC 6709, we
observe the ﬁeld over several months, a comparatively long base-

line that is permitted by our robotic observing, determine which
stars in the ﬁeld belong to the cluster, and obtain their corre-
sponding colors from literature. We then construct light curves
for each star from the collection of frames. We then perform time
series analyses to obtain rotation periods and error estimates for
each member star.

2.1. Data Aquisitionand Reduction

The observations were obtained using 1.2 m telescope STELLA-
I at the Izaña Observatory in Tenerife, Spain from May 2015
until September 2016. This is part of the STELLA robotic
observatory which also includes the 1.2 m spectroscopic tele-
scope STELLA-II. The observatory operates robotically each
night via in-house custom-built software (Granzer 2004), pro-
vided conditions are suitable for observing targets determined
by a program with user-deﬁned priorities. For more information
about STELLA operation, please see Strassmeier et al. (2004),
Strassmeier et al. (2010), and Weber et al. (2016).

4064 pixels, or 22′ ×

The CCD resolution for the wide-ﬁeld imager WiFSIP V2.0
is 4066
22′. A single ﬁeld was used to
observe NGC 6709 due to its relatively small angular size. This
ﬁeld contains over two-thirds of the member stars when centered
on the cluster. Observations were acquired in the Johnson V band
with exposure times of 24 s, 120 s, and 300 s to retain sensitivity
to as wide a range of bright (bluer) and faint (redder) stars as was
practicable.

Table 1 summarizes the dates and total number of successful
observations available for each exposure time, after discarding
any unusable frames due to bad seeing, poor weather conditions,
lunar proximity, and tracking errors. Signiﬁcant numbers of such
frames are a typical consequence of robotic observations. With
the 24 s exposures, visits to the target happened up to ten times
per night, although typically usable frames on any successful
night were in the range of three to seven. For the longer expo-
sures of 120 s, this dropped to a maximum of seven times per
night, with typical values below six. And for the longest expo-
sure time, the range was up to four times per night for the target.
The maximum time baseline of observations for each exposure
group is under six months to observe multiple theoretical vari-
ability cycles. This dataset exceeds our minimum requirement
of 50 usable frames for each exposure time and the minimum
acceptable time baseline of 60 days to preserve our sensitivity to
the longer rotation periods.

2.1.1. Membership

We adopt the membership study of Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2018)
(hereafter CG18) to deﬁne member stars as all stars in the
study with a membership probability of 50% or greater. This
study makes use of the recent high-precision Gaia observa-
tions and includes many dimmer members that previous studies
were unable to observe likely due to instrument limitations (e.g.,
Hakkila et al. 1983; Kharchenko et al. 2013; Dias et al. 2014).

2.2. Catalogs

Supporting data for observations in standard passbands are taken
from the literature by cross-referencing the coordinates of stars
in our ﬁeld with widely used catalogs. The coordinates were
obtained by converting pixel coordinates to sky coordinates
using WCSTools (Mink 1997) and then matched to catalogs
with Astropy (Astropy Collaboration et al. 2018). We use the
UCAC4 catalog for measurements in the B and V passbands
(Zacharias et al. 2013) and the Gaia EDR3 catalog for G, GBP,
and GRP s(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, 2020). We ﬁnd some
improvement in the Gaia colors with the EDR3 catalog over the
DR2 values given in CG18.

We primarily utilize the Gaia EDR3 colors for this work as it
is the most complete catalog to date with photometry for almost
all of the stars in our ﬁeld. Observations in the B and V pass-
bands only exist for the brighter stars and hence are available for
only a fraction of our cluster members. In order to facilitate a
comparison with studies performed in B
V colors, we use the
equations in Appendix A of Gruner & Barnes (2020) to calcu-
late values for B
GRP when no such values can
−
be found in the UCAC4 catalog. The conversions between the
two are piece-wise empirical functions ﬁt to, among others, the
Pleiades and so should be reasonable for NGC 6709.

observation covers the denser cluster center, and so we have ob-
servations for 210 of the cluster members. CG18 was limited to
stars with mG < 18 due to the increase in errors at higher ap-
parent magnitudes. This eﬀectively limits the determination of
membership for stars of NGC 6709 to K-stars or bluer due to the
distance and reddening of the cluster. We search for possible ad-
ditional members not included in CG18 using the Gaia EDR3
proper motion data and membership equation of Sagar (1987).
These additional stars are listed in Table 3. Radial velocity mea-
surements for cluster members are sparse, with measurements
mainly obtained from the red giants and a few other bright mem-
bers (e.g., Subramaniam & Sagar 1999; Mermilliod et al. 2008;
Kharchenko et al. 2013; Soubiran et al. 2018) and so member-

Gaia EDR3 measured parallaxes for each star are used for the
distance modulus calculation, rather than a single value for the
entire cluster.

We use a ﬁt to solar-metallicity PARSEC isochrones for
158 Myr to determine a good reddening value for this work
(Bressan et al. 2012). We select solar metallicity based on the
spectroscopic analysis of Smiljanic et al. (2018) for the red gi-
ant member BD+10 3697 (Gaia EDR3 4311559274405377280),
where [Fe/H] =
0.01. This isochrone also provides a good ﬁt
for the two red giants in the membership study of CG18. The
CMDs corrected with the values in Table 4 are shown in Figure 2
for (B

surements are lacking for MB and MV , we use instead the con-
version of Gruner & Barnes (2020) to convert the Gaia colors to
Johnson colors and ﬁll in the lower right of the main sequence
in the upper panel as well as a few brighter members which also
lack observations in both B and V. Also shown is the PARSEC
isochrone. Binaries in the lower panel are either determined by
their location above the main sequence or by the correspond-
ing Gaia re-normalized unit weight error measurements where

2.3. Construction of Light Curves

The light curves for individual stars are constructed using
Daophot II (Stetson 1987; Stetson et al. 1990). First, one mas-
ter frame for each exposure time was selected from all the us-
able observations. We selected frames from the following dates:
2016-07-09 for 24 s, 2016-05-31 for 120 s, and 2015-07-17 for
300 s. These frames were selected based on low levels of light
contamination, the goodness of the instrument focus, the lack of
artifacts, and the low ellipticity of the stars. In order to use point-
spread-function (PSF) photometry, suitable stars had to be se-
lected from all possibilities found by Daophot II. Approximately
300 sources were selected for PSF photometry from the sug-
gested PSF stars found by the program, and individually checked
for counts comfortably between the background and saturation
level and a minimum distance from other light sources of at least
15′′. Furthermore, a cross section examination of pixel values
across these stars should have a single peak and the star circular.
As a ﬁnal step, any stars located near bad pixels were discarded.
Once the stars for PSF photometry are selected, AllStar
is used to ﬁnd instrumental magnitudes for all sources in each
frame using the stars assigned for the PSF photometry as a ref-
erence point. These magnitudes from each of these frames are
then assembled as light curves using DaoMatch and DaoMaster.
DaoMatch ﬁrst pinpoints each source possible in every frame by
taking the 30 brightest stars in each separate frame, matching
triangles with the master frame, and deriving a coordinate trans-
formation for use from frame to frame. DaoMaster then reﬁnes
those transformations and applies them to all sources and assigns
each source its own identiﬁer across all frames. Each source is
then outputted with its pixel location on the master frame and

measured magnitudes from each frame, forming a time series
for each star.

Figure 3 shows the mean apparent magnitude found by
Daophot II versus the uncertainty in apparent magnitude. Mag-
nitude diﬀerences are detectable down to the millimag regime.
The shift in the apparent magnitude access for each exposure set
is the average of the diﬀerence between the mV determined by
Daophot II and the apparent magnitude in the V-band for stars
in the UCAC4 catalog. It can be seen that the fainter stars overall
exhibit more uncertainty, and that the ﬁeld contains some highly
variable stars. The ﬁnal step in producing the light curves was
to remove outliers using the sigma clipping function in SciPy
(Jones et al. 2001; Virtanen et al. 2020).

2.3.1. Time Series Analysis

To analyze the light curves, four methods were selected with the
criteria of applicability to randomly spaced observations. The
Phase Dispersion Minimization method (hereafter PDM) from
Stellingwerf (1978) tests for periods that minimize the disper-
sion when the data are phased to the test periods. No a priori
knowledge of the shape of the light curve is required for this
method and so possible spot structure should not aﬀect the re-
sults. The String Length method (hereafter SL) of Dworetsky
(1983) phases the data with a test period and calculates a to-
tal “string length” between the data points, seeking periods that
minimize this string length. Similar to the PDM, this method
utilizes phase folding and seeks a minimum in the periodogram.
This method is chosen as an alternative method to the PDM to
examine the dispersion present in a phase-folded light curve.

The Generalized Lomb-Scargle method (or GLS) of
Zechmeister & Kürster (2009) is a frequency analysis method
that accounts for errors and oﬀsets of the dataset. The GLS
method can handle unevenly sampled data and ﬁts the light
curves to a combination of sine and cosine waves. We addition-
ally use the CLEAN method of Roberts et al. (1987) which also
samples frequencies but removes artifacts from unevenly sam-
pled data such as the one-day alias. This serves as a complemen-
tary method to GLS in that it may amplify the true signal when
more than one period is present in the data or there is a contri-
bution of noise. Periods obtained via these methods appear as
maxima in the periodograms.

2.3.2. Period Selection

After obtaining periodograms with the four methods, we select
a period based on the following criteria:

for all stars with light curves.

2. The magnitude variations are higher than the noise from the

constant stars of similar magnitudes.

3. The phase-folded data have a single maximum and minimum

to avoid selecting a higher harmonic of the period.

4. The ﬁt is valid across the most of the time series and there is

a suitable density of observations.

Each criterion is given one point, and only periods that have three
or four points total for at least one exposure time are selected as
candidate periods for the stars.

The light curve and the selected period are visually inspected
for each of the three exposure times independently. This system
of determining periods tends to err on the side of caution in as-
signing a rotation period since each individual method does not
always successfully recover the true rotation period and depends
on factors such as the signal-to-noise ratio, object brightness, and
sampling (e.g., Graham et al. 2013). 186 out of the 204 cluster
member stars were found in more than one exposure batch, and
so the selected periods at diﬀerent exposure times for the same
star are compared. In most cases, the discrepancy is less than 0.1
day, and the few exceptions are harmonics or subharmonics.

From the cases where a star has more than one possible pe-
riod due to the multiple exposure times, we select as our period
whichever fulﬁlls more criteria, has the clearest peaks or dips in
the periodograms, and has the most observations, in that order.
In some cases, a period is not recovered at a diﬀerent exposure
time either because the exposure time was too short to capture
the magnitude changes and variability, or the exposure time was
too long and reached saturation.

2.3.3. Error Analysis

1. There is agreement within 0.1 days between a primary dip
in the PDM method and primary peak in the GLS method.
There is similar evidence of minima/maxima in the peri-
odograms of the SL and CLEAN methods.

Error bars for periods are obtained from Gaussian ﬁts to the
corresponding period minimum in the PDM. Fits are made for
PDMs with minima of 0.6, although exceptions are made for for
those with a minimum between 0.6 and 0.8 that show a strong

single peak in the GLS periodogram. We use the standard devia-
tion σ of the Gaussian distribution as an indication of the possi-
ble error in the periods so that wide peaks correspond to a larger
error than narrow peaks. We use the only the error associated
with the exposure the ﬁnal period was selected from. Because
this is selected via Gaussian distributions ﬁt to the PDM peri-
odogram, this σ is accordingly only associated with the PDM
method. The SL method does not provide clear minima in most
cases, and the GLS and CLEAN methods use a grid in frequency
space and thus skew the errors when translated to the period
space.

3. Results

4. Discussion

Due to the faintness of NGC 6709, we use the color system GBP
and GRP from the Gaia EDR3 survey to avoid the necessity of
converting the colors for the fainter stars that lack observations in
other passbands. We use the conversion from Gruner & Barnes
(2020) to convert between Gaia colors and Johnson colors. The
two bluest stars with rotation periods from NGC 6709 are omit-
ted from the discussion as these are A-type stars and lack a con-
vection zone, considered a critical component for the dynamo
type that supports the formation of star spots (e.g., Berdyugina
2005). Thus, their periodicity is likely the result of being mem-
bers of a multi-star system and actual rotation rate is unknown.
For a more in-depth discussion of the behavior of these models
including M-dwarfs, which are not present in our sample, please
see F20.

Each exposure time group was done independently in Daophot
II. This allowed for conﬁrmation of rotation periods among stars
that appeared in more than one exposure group. Of the 210
cluster members mentioned in Section 2.1.1, we constructed
lightcurves for 187 probable members. Of these, 182 are FGK
stars and 5 are A stars. From these, we ﬁnd periods for 45 FGK
cluster members and 2 of the A stars. All rotation periods found
and the Gaia EDR3 designations along with catalog and calcu-
lated colors are shown in Table 5. Final periods were selected
via the method outlined in 2.3.2. Stars either showed agreement
between diﬀerent exposure times within a few percent, or the
harmonic or subharmonic periods produced a stronger signal at
a diﬀerent exposure. We show the phased light curves and re-
sults from the period analysis methods in Figures 4 – 11. We
omit the SL method as the noise mostly dominated the results.
In most cases, the selected period shows agreement between the
PDM, Clean, and GLS methods, but in a few cases the noise
level is higher than the magnitude changes and the minima with
the PDM methods are weak, and so we pick our periods from
the CLEAN and GLS methods. With each phased light curve,
we subtract the mean, and the relative magnitude changes come
from the results of Daophot II.

4.1. Stellarspin-down models

We compare the results with several models of stellar rotation
and age. These models are semi-empirical and use a theoretical
framework built on the mechanisms thought to be responsible
for stellar spin-down and are calibrated to observations of, for
example, the Sun, or well studied clusters such as the Hyades.
We select the models of Barnes & Kim (2010) (hereafter B10),
Matt et al. (2015) (hereafter M15), Amard et al. (2019) (here-
after A19), and Spada & Lanzafame (2020) (hereafter S20) to
derive theoretical isochrones for the estimated age of NGC 6709.
The isochrones from the models are plotted against the rota-
tion periods found for NGC 6709 in Figure 13. All four stellar
spin-down models have the same basic premise: a ZAMS star
with some initial rotation rate P0 will begin to spin down due to
coupling of the magnetic ﬁeld with the stellar wind. The spin-
down rate depends on the Rossby number

Ro = Prot/τconv,

(4)

where τconv is the convective turnover time. The selected models
diﬀer in some of the physical constraints and free parameters, but
all reproduce to some degree the observed rotational behavior.

Our color-period diagram (hereafter CPD) is shown in Figure 12
for both (B

comparison with other literature studies of rotation rates versus
colors, but as can be seen here, the sequence demonstrates more
GRP)0. The CPD shows a sequence of
spread than for (GBP
increasing rotation periods towards redder stars. Below this se-
quence there is a small clump of rapidly rotating K-stars, which
is to be expected for a cluster that is younger than
200 Myr.
The photometric binaries lie below the slow rotator sequence,
although these also have longer periods towards the cooler stars.
NGC 6709, due to observational limits, lacks observations for
the M-dwarfs. Above the slow rotator sequence, there is at least
one probable binary with a much slower rotation period and a
membership probability of 0.6. There are also two bright stars
that exhibit rotation periods, but whether these are the result of
multi-star systems or some phenomenon occurring in the line
of sight is unknown. The rotation periods for these two stars
only appeared in the 24 s exposure due to saturation at longer
exposure times, but the periodic magnitude change is signiﬁcant
enough that a signal was found in multiple time series analysis
methods.

4.1.1. The Barnes & Kim 2010 model

The B10 model is a dimensionless description of period evolu-
tion over time. The equation combines both evolution of the fast
(C) and slow (I) sequences so that the period evolution equation
is

1 and 452 Myr d−

where t is the stellar age, kC and kI are dimensionless con-
stants derived from observations, Prot is the rotation period at
stellar age, and P0 is the initial rotation period. In order to be
consistent with previous work, τconv is the global τc from Ta-
ble 1 of Barnes & Kim (2010), and the constants kC and kI are
1, respectively. The initial rotation
0.646 d Myr−
of the fast sequence is P0 = 0.12 d and for the slow sequence,
P0 = 3.4 d. These are based on observations of the extrema of
initial rotation periods of young cluster members. The C and I se-
quences that emerge from these equations provide limiting cases.
The B10 model is show in Figure 13 for an age of 150 Myr
with initial rotation periods of 3.4 d and 0.12 d as the solid and
dotted blue lines respectively to recreate the limits of the I and C
sequences. The model results in rotation periods too slow for F-
type stars and too fast for the K-type stars when compared to the

are no cluster members with rotation periods shorter than the
limit created by the C sequence, which corresponds to stars with
an initial rotation period of 0.12 d, which is near the break-up
speed for FGK stars. The rapid rotators are not well-populated,
at least partially due to the lack of observations for M-stars.

which is not a surprise as the constants for this model were cali-
brated using the solar age and rotation period.

4.1.2. The Matt et al. 2015 model

4.1.3. The Amard et al. 2019 model

The M15 model examines the changes in the torque over time on
a star and the relationship with Ro. Stellar activity is divided into
two regimes, saturated and unsaturated, based on whether mag-
netic activity indicators have approached some saturated values
independent of Ro. The saturated and unsaturated regimes cor-
respond to rapid and slow rotators, respectively. We model the
limit of the saturated and unsaturated regimes, Equations 10 and
11 respectively in M15, and input an age of 150 Myr. The mo-
ment of inertia is from the stellar tracks of Baraﬀe et al. (2015)
and the convective turnover time is based on the empirical rela-
tion given in Cranmer & Saar (2011), as the model is calibrated
to these values for τ. For the saturated limit, we use an initial
rotation period of P0 = 0.2 d. Using the adopted parameters pro-
vided in Table 1 in the Erratum which are adjusted to recreate
solar values at a solar age, we show the model in Figure 13 with
the solid line indicating the limit from the unsaturated regime
and the dotted line the limit from the saturated regime.

The model provides a pretty good description of the G-stars
and our few K-stars along the slow branch. Our F-stars show
rotation periods where the model predicts either very rapid rota-
tion or none at all. The saturated limit for the torque is similar to
the lower limit of the most rapid rotators from the B10 model,
although it allows for slightly more rapid rotation in the solar
regime. Few cluster members actually lie near this limit, but in-
stead occupy the space between.

The rotation periods of A19 are based on models calculated us-
ing the STAREVOL v3.40 code. The models follow structural
and rotational evolution and include the disc-coupling timescale
and wind braking. To match our cluster, we use the models for
solar metallicity (Z = 0.0134) and an age of log T = 8.2, or
158 Myr. We show the models for both the slow and rapid rota-
tors in Figure 13 as solid and dotted gold lines respectively. This
corresponds to initial rotation rates of 1.6 days (2.3 days for stars
with M > 1.2M
) for the rapid rotators and 9.0 days for the slow
rotators.

⊙

From the ﬁgure it can be seen that this model does not ﬁt
well, and a younger isochrone for the cluster would likely ﬁt
better as this one has an all-around too aggressive spin down
for stars as compared to the other models. This model, however,
does reproduce better the rotation rates of our few F-type stars.
The lower limit for the rapid rotators matches fairly closely with
the corresponding saturated limit of the M15 model for the G-
and K-type stars. This is not entirely surprising as the torque at
the surface uses the M15 formulation for the change in angular
momentum.

4.1.4. The Spada & Lanzafame 2020 model

We also show the model of S20 in Figure 13 in violet. Unlike the
previous models, this model has only the slow rotator sequence.
The model scales rotational coupling and stellar wind braking
with mass to explain the lack of low-mass stars that have reached
the slow rotator sequence for clusters younger than 1 Gyr. We use

This model does reproduce fairly well the rotation periods
for the K-type stars and the hotter G-type stars, but the spindown
is not aggressive enough for the solar-type and cooler stars and
the resulting rotation periods are too rapid compared to what has
been observed for our cluster members.

4.2. Comparison to other open clusters

We compare the CPD of NGC 6709 to the similarly aged clus-
ters detailed in F20. It can be seen in Figure 14 from overlay-
ing NGC 6709 with NGC 2516, the benchmark cluster from that
work, that although NGC 6709 is fainter and has a few giant
members, it exhibits almost identical rotational behavior. F20
also compares their open cluster with other similarly aged open
clusters M35, the Pleiades, M50, and Blanco I in their Figure
17, and notes the near identical structure of the rotation periods

The slow rotator sequence of NGC 6709 is very similar to
that of NGC 2516. The slow-sequence for NGC 6709 is very
slightly above that of NGC 2516, and so this cluster should ac-
cordingly be slightly older. There is an outlier with a much

is not possible between the two clusters.

5. Conclusions

We observe the open cluster NGC 6709 over multiple observing
seasons to obtain for the ﬁrst time 2–4 month long photometric
light curves using Daophot II. Member FGK stars are identiﬁed
and analyzed using four diﬀerent methods (PDM, SL, GLS, and
CLEAN) to ﬁnd periodicities. By comparing the results from
these four methods, we obtain rotation periods for 47 member
stars within our ﬁeld. We calculate the error of these rotation
periods from the FWHM of the peak from the PDM method.

Using Gaia colors, we make a color-period diagram of clus-
ter members. This CPD has a sequence of slow rotators with
increasing rotation periods towards the redder stars and a small
clump of rapidly rotating stars that have not yet converged onto
the aforementioned slow sequence. The six photometric binary
members show no signiﬁcant diﬀerence and follow the same pat-
tern as other member stars. We compare isochrones from theo-
retical, empirical, and semi-empirical models for stellar rotation
and evolution to our CPD and estimate the cluster age to be about
150 Myr. This is within the range of ages estimated from liter-
ature based on isochrones from color-magnitude comparisons.
The models that best ﬁt the CPD of NGC 6709 are those of M15
and S20.

The rotation periods follow a similar behavior as to that ob-
served in other open clusters of similar ages and characteristics.
We compare this cluster’s CPD to NGC 2516 in the work of
F20 and ﬁnd that the rotation period distribution for NGC 6709
matches that of NGC 2516. F20 also compares NGC 2516 to four
more open clusters of similar ages, the Pleiades, M35, M50, and
Blanco I. This is further support that the mechanisms driving the
star formation and subsequent spin-down for stars with similar
parameters are the same for open clusters with suﬃciently simi-
lar parameters of age and metallicity everywhere.
