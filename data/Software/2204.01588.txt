Abstract.

The development and the spread of increasingly autonomous digital
technologies in our society pose new ethical challenges beyond data pro-
tection and privacy violation. Users are unprotected in their interactions
with digital technologies and at the same time autonomous systems are
free to occupy the space of decisions that is prerogative of each human
being. In this context the multidisciplinary project Exosoul aims at de-
veloping a personalized software exoskeleton which mediates actions in
the digital world according to the moral preferences of the user. The
exoskeleton relies on the ethical proﬁling of a user, similar in purpose to
the privacy proﬁling proposed in the literature, but aiming at reﬂecting
and predicting general moral preferences. Our approach is hybrid, ﬁrst
based on the identiﬁcation of proﬁles in a top-down manner, and then
on the reﬁnement of proﬁles by a personalized data-driven approach. In
this work we report our initial experiment on building such top-down
proﬁles. We consider the correlations between ethics positions (ideal-
ism and relativism) personality traits (honesty/humility, conscientious-
ness, Machiavellianism and narcissism) and worldview (normativism),
and then we use a clustering approach to create ethical proﬁles predic-
tive of user’s digital behaviors concerning privacy violation, copy-right
infringements, caution and protection. Data were collected by adminis-
tering a questionnaire to 317 young individuals. In the paper we discuss
two clustering solutions, one data-driven and one model-driven, in terms
of validity and predictive power of digital behavior.

1. Introduction

There is a general and growing consensus that the diﬀusion of autonomous digital
technology may harm the values our societies are based on. Europe is at the
forefront of the elaboration on these issues especially from a regulatory point of
view. First concerning privacy with the GDPR [51] and currently with the AI act
[16]. Regulation is important and represents the level of awareness that the society
as a whole has matured regarding the potential misuse of digital technologies.

 
 
 
 
 
 
However it is not suﬃcient and cannot cover all the space of potential misuses
concerning the risk which attains the core of the fundamental rights of the citizens.
Privacy concerns are insuﬃcient: ethics and the human dignity are at stake [31,32].
As a matter of fact, individuals are unprotected and powerless in their interaction
with the digital world. In a digital society where the relationship between citizens
and machines is uneven, moral values like individuality and responsibility are at
risk. Despite the ideal of a human centric AI and the recommendations to empower
the users, the power and the burden to preserve the users’ rights still remain in
the hands of the (autonomous-) systems producers. The EXOSOUL [8] project
aims to empower humans with an automatically generated exoskeleton, i.e. a
software shield that protects them and their personal data through the mediation
of all interactions with the digital world that would result in unacceptable or
morally wrong behaviors according to their ethical and privacy preferences. The
exoskeleton relies on the ethical proﬁling of a user, similar in purpose to the
privacy proﬁling proposed in the literature [60,20], but aiming at reﬂecting general
moral preferences and predicting user’s digital behaviors accordingly like proposed
in [40]. More precisely, EXOSOUL is based on the notion of digital ethics [23]
and its separation in soft ethics to reﬂect user’s ethics and hard ethics to deﬁne
the ethical values a digital system shall comply with. Our approach is hybrid,
ﬁrst based on the identiﬁcation of proﬁles in a top-down manner, and then on
the reﬁnement of proﬁles by a personalized data-driven approach see Fig.1. In the
following we report our initial experiment on building such top-down proﬁles.

2. Experiment

2.1. Theoretical Background

In order to deﬁne users’ ethical proﬁles we considered the Ethics Position Theory
(EPT)[24,27,50], which suggests individuals’ diﬀerences in moral judgments. This
theory posits that the individuals’ personal morality contains unique and idiosyn-
cratic elements that depend on the experience related to moral issues. These el-
ements are sustained by two dimensions: idealism and relativism. The former re-
ﬂects absolute moral principles, mostly oriented to truth, benevolence and avoid-
ing harming others. The latter relies on the careful evaluations of the situations,
contexts and consequences, and also reﬂects the idea that harm is sometimes nec-
essary in order to produce good. These two dimensions are based on the deonto-
logical and teleological models, respectively. The deontological perspective deﬁnes
the rightness and wrongness of possible courses of action, by comparing them
with pre-determined norms representing personal values, whereas the teleological
perspective considers the perceived consequences, the probability and the desir-
ability of each course of action for various stakeholder groups, and the importance
of each group. The EPT does not assume that individuals are only rule-oriented
(idealism) or consequence-oriented (relativism), but rather assumes that individ-
uals can range from high to low in their idealism and relativism ideologies. This
leads to identify four moral philosophies: situationism, subjectivism, absolutism,
and exceptionism (see Table 1, [50]).

this research.

Low Idealism

High Idealism

Low Relativism
Exceptionists: Conventionalists who
tolerate exceptions to moral standards
when beneﬁts oﬀset potential harmful
consequences.
Absolutists: Principled idealists who
endorse both reliance on moral stan-
dards and striving to minimize harm
done to others

High Relativism
Subjectivists: Realists who do not en-
dorse moral standards that deﬁne right
and wrong or the avoidance of harmful
consequences
Situationists: Idealistic contextualists
who value minimizing harm rather than
reliance on moral standards that deﬁne
right and wrong

Table 1. The four moral types identiﬁed in EPT.

The EPT has been related to personality, which includes dispositions, tem-
peraments, characters, attitudes, values, and so forth. Personality is “the dynamic
organization within the individual of those psycho-physical systems that deter-
mine his unique adjustments to the environment” (p. 48)[4], by creating ”....the

Al-
though the personality attributes are independent of each other, some can align to
form proﬁles of shared similarities. This means that individuals’ ethics positions
are systematically related, amongst others, to personality[25]. The most consol-
idated approach to personality assumes that a small number of enduring dispo-
sitions or traits provides the basis for diﬀerences and similarities among people.
In this vein, the Five Factor Model (FFM)[17,18] is the most useful framework,
given that the 5 personality traits identiﬁed have emerged with great regularity in
diﬀerent studies: neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and
openness. Afterward, the Hexaco theory of personality identiﬁed a sixth factor:
honesty/humility trait[36,37]. In addition, the construct of Dark Triad person-
ality was also proposed, based on the idea that the human nature encompasses
also a constellation of sub-clinical and malevolent traits[52], which reﬂect diﬀerent
facets of antisocial and adverse personality[55]: psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
and narcissism.

In particular, honesty/humility and conscientiousness traits were found to
be mostly associated positively with morality and integrity[13,54], and highly
resistant to moral disengagement[14,49,19,41]. Basically, these two personality
traits can give insights into what a moral character is[12].

Speciﬁcally, the honesty/humility trait reﬂects sincerity, fairness, greed, mod-
esty, and no manipulation, no interested in richness, luxuries, and elevated social
status. This trait is characterized by ”the tendency to be fair and genuine in
dealing with others, in the sense of cooperation with others even when one might
exploit others without suﬀering retaliation” (p. 156)[6]. It was found related pos-
itively to individualizing values (e.g., sensitivity to harm and fairness)[68]. This
leads people with high honesty/humility to conform to idealism rather than to
relativism. Indeed, previous studies showed that honesty-humility is correlated
positively to idealism and negatively to relativism [14,49].

Conscientiousness reﬂects the tendency of being persistent in the pursuit of
goals/tasks, and relies on orderliness, meeting of obligations, self-conﬁdence, self-
regulation and self-discipline, integrity, fairness, and inhibition of impulses that
go against moral obligations. Conscientious people can determine their ethical
codes, are less social and tend to sacriﬁce social ties for achieving goals[38]. Con-
scientiousness was related to the exceptionist moral philosophy, being not corre-
lated either to idealism or relativism[33]. However, other studies showed that this
trait was either positively correlated to relativism[25], or positively to idealism
but negatively to relativism[14,49].

As concerns the Dark Triad construct, the three malevolent personality traits
were found related to moral disengagement and schadenfreunde (feeling of plea-
sure at another’s suﬀering)[22]. Notably, Machiavellianism and psychopathy are
highly correlated, especially in relation to the Big Five personality traits. Thus,
these two personality traits are seen as a single psychopathic entity[48], whereas
narcissism is considered the lightest dimension of the Dark Triad[28]. Besides,
these two traits are more predictive of digital behaviors. Machiavellianism and
narcissism were found positively related to self-promotion on Facebook[57], to the
number of personal information disclosed online[58,56], and to the tendency to
self-disclose in computer-based communication[58]. Machiavellianism and vulner-

able narcissism predicted also problematic social media use[34] and less congru-
ence between the true self and the Instagram self[29].

In details, Machiavellianism reﬂects actions oriented to pragmatism, entails
a lack of aﬀect in interpersonal relationships, and moral standards. High Machi-
avellianism is associated with manipulative and cynical tactics, the basic attitude
being ’the ends justify the means’[10,15]. Machiavellianism is characterized by
an utilitarian rather than a moral view when interacting with others[10]. Diﬀer-
ent studies showed that Machiavellianism correlates negatively to idealism but
positively to relativism[14,35,39]. Following Leary et al.[35], Machiavellianism is
basically associated with the subjectivism moral philosophy.

Narcissism is supported by an inﬂated opinion of self, feelings of entitlement,
superiority, need for admiration[21], egoism and arrogance[26]. It is also charac-
terized by moral disengagement[49], unethical attitudes and questionable behav-
iors aimed at pointing out high achievements, which in turn reiterate admiration,
power, and ego superiority[30,53]. Narcissism was found to correlate positively to
idealism but not to relativism[67], or to be higher in relativistic egoists cluster
than idealistic altruists cluster[11]. Yet, the narcissistic gratiﬁcation dimensions
correlated to idealism but not to relativism[63]. These contradictory results sup-
port the idea that narcissists can behave morally ’right’ to increase their ego and
get higher levels of narcissistic supplies from helping others, even though they are
morally disengaged.

Notably, beside personality, individuals’ ethics positions can be also related to
worldviews. Following the Polarity Theory[66], human worldviews are deﬁned by
humanism, which relies on humanity and experiences as intrinsically valuable, and
normativism, which relies on values determined by external norms and ideals[43].
Thus, humanistic people rarely engage in misconduct because they hold group
values and beliefs and seek aﬃliated interests[62]. Humanism was found related
positively to the political left, preferences for equality, openness, emotionality
and honesty/humility traits, as well as to moral intuitions pertaining to fairness
and prevention of harm, and negatively to levels of authoritarianism, social domi-
nance, general and economic system justiﬁcation[46]. By contrast, normativism is
related positively to the political right, conservative issue preferences, resistance
to change, acceptance of inequality, and negatively to openness, emotionality and
honesty/humility traits[44], as well as with moral intuitions pertaining to ingroup
loyalty, respect for authority, and protection of sanctity[46]. Given this picture, it
is reasonable to assume that humanism is more compatible with idealism, whereas
normativism with relativism. However, normativism could be also associated with
idealism if people idealize their worldview. In the present study we used only the
normativism worldview scale[45] because the humanism worldview resembles the
honesty/humility personality trait.

Based on the literature reviewed above, the ethics positions (idealism and rel-
ativism), personality (honesty/humility, conscientiousness, Machiavellianism and
narcissism) and worldview (normativism) variables were combined by a clustering
approach in order to identify ethical proﬁles.

2.2. Methods

2.2.1. Participants

330 participants (182 females, 138 males and 10 individuals with no gender in-
formation; mean age = 20.52 years, s.d. = 2.55; age range = 18-35 years) were
recruited from the University of L’Aquila, Italy. Participants were not requested
to give their informed consent, given that the questionnaire was anonymous, in
compliance with the European privacy legislation GDPR. The internal review
board approved the study.

2.2.2. Materials

The following tests were administered.
The Italian adaptation of the Ethics Position Questionnaire (EPQ-5) [50]: 5 items
for idealism (e.g., A person should make certain that their actions never inten-
tionally harm another even to a small degree ’also actions performed by Inter-
net or the computer’) and 5 for relativism (e.g., What is ethical varies from one
situation and society to another ’also situations that occur on the Web’). Given
the purpose of the present research, beside each item, we reported an example
of an action referred to the digital world (the examples are not included in the
original questionnaire). For each item, participants were asked to rate the degree
of agreement from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The item analysis
showed that the corrected item-total correlation was acceptable for both scales
(greater or equal to .30[47]). The reliability (internal consistencies) was α = .63
for the idealism scale, and α = .69. for the relativism scale.
The Italian adaptation of the HEXACO-60 [7]: 10 items for honesty/humility (e.g.,
I wouldn’t use ﬂattery to get a raise or promotion at work, even if I thought
it would succeed) and 10 for conscientiousness (e.g, I plan ahead and organize
things, to avoid scrambling at the last minute). For each item, participants are
asked to rate the degree of agreement from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly
agree). The item analysis showed that 3 items for each scale were not satisfactory
in terms of corrected item-total correlation[47]. Thus, 7 items were retained for
each scale. The reliability was α = .68 for the honesty/humility scale, and α =
.69 for the conscientiousness scale.
The Italian version of the Dark Triad Dirty Dozen[61]: 4 items for Machiavellian-
ism (e.g. I tend to manipulate others to get my way) and 4 for narcissism (e.g.
I tend to want others to admire me). For each item, participants were asked to
rate the degree of agreement from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The
item analysis showed that the corrected item-total correlation was acceptable for
both scales. The reliability was α = .77 for the Machiavellianism scale, and α =
.81 for the Narcissism scale.
The English version of normativism scale [45]: 2 items were original (e.g. The
maintenance of law and order is the most important duty of any government),
while the third one was created by us. For each item, participants are asked to
rate the degree of agreement from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
The item analysis showed that all items were satisfactory in terms of corrected
item-total correlation. The reliability was α = .72.

The digital behavior scale: 3 items created by us for privacy violation (e.g. I use
the personal information of others without permission - e.g., a photo of a friend);
3 items adapted in Italian from the Unethical Computer Use Behavior Scale
(UCUBS) [42] for copy-right infringements (e.g. I use software without owning a
licence); 2 items adapted in Italian from Buchanan et al. [9], plus 2 created by us
items for caution (e.g. Do you read a website’s privacy policy before registering
your information?). For each item, participants were asked to rate the degree of
frequency of each action from 1 (never) to 5 (always). The reliability was α =
.66 for privacy violation, α = .66 for copy-right infringements, and α = .70 for
caution.
In general, all reliability coeﬃcients are satisfactory (see [64]).

2.2.3. Procedure

The questionnaire was administered by means of the platform ’LimeSurvey’. The
address of the questionnaire was disseminated to the students in the the form of
a URL and by a QR-Code to facilitate its use by camera-equipped devices. To
avoid the order eﬀect due to ﬁxed order of the questions, the scales were presented
randomly across participants. The questionnaire administration lasted about 15
minutes.

2.2.4. Plan of Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed by IBM SPSS Statistics version 20. Data were
transformed in z-scores. The standard cut-oﬀ of ±3 standard deviations away
from the mean was used to remove outliers: in total 13 outliers were detected and
excluded from subsequent analyses. This led to a ﬁnal sample of 317 participants
(177 females, 130 males, and 10 individual with no gender information; mean age
= 20.53 years; s.d. = 2.58). First of all, the cluster analyses were carried out us-
ing as variables idealism, relativism, honesty/humility, conscientiousness, Machi-
avellianism, narcissism and normativism. Two diﬀerent approaches were pursued.
The ﬁrst approach was data-driven and aimed at exploring the dataset using the
two-step method, that is conducting a hierarchical cluster analysis using Ward’s
method, and a subsequent conﬁrmatory k-means analysis. This method provides
a relatively robust identiﬁcation of clusters[65]. The second approach was model-
driven and aimed at conﬁrming the ETP, which identiﬁes four moral philoso-
phies: situationism, subjectivism, absolutism, and exceptionism. Thus, only the
k-means conﬁrmatory analysis was used, with 4 predetermined clusters. For each
approach, univariate analyses of variance (Anova) were conducted to explore the
validity, using idealism, relativism, honesty/humility, conscientiousness, Machi-
avellianism, narcissism and normativism as dependent variables, and the cluster
solution as the independent variable. In addition, the discriminant analysis was
performed to clarify the classiﬁcation of the cases according to the cluster solu-
tion. Finally, Anovas were also conducted to explore the predictive power of the
cluster solutions in terms of digital behavior.

2.3. Results

The cluster analysis - Data-driven approach The cluster solution was determined
considering the dendrogram, the agglomeration schedule coeﬃcients, and the in-
terpretability of the cluster solution[2]. The analysis suggested a 2-cluster solution
(see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Dendrogram using the Ward’s
method

Figure 3. 2-Cluster solution

The k-means analysis was carried with k = 2 (see Figure 3). The silhouette
value, which is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared
to the other clusters, is 0.3, which is considered acceptable. The ﬁrst cluster was
formed by 210 subjects, whereas the second cluster by 107 subjects. Based on the
variables distribution within each cluster, we deﬁned the ﬁrst cluster ’virtuous’
and the second cluster ’opportunist’.

Regarding the validity of the cluster solution, the ’virtuous’ cluster produced
higher scores in idealism, honesty/humility, conscientiousness, and lower scores
in relativism, Machiavellianism and narcissism than the ’opportunist’ cluster. No
diﬀerence was found between the two clusters in normativism (see Table 2).

Regarding the discriminant analysis, 98,7% of original grouped cases and

98.1% of cross-validated grouped cases were correctly classiﬁed.

Table 2. Diﬀerences between the ‘virtuous’ and ‘opportunist’ clusters

As concerns the diﬀerences between the two clusters in the digital behaviour,
the ’virtuous’ cluster scored lower in privacy violations [F (1,315) = 26.09, p <

.0001; Mean(SD) -.197(.066) vs .387(.093)] and copyright infringements [F (1,315)
= 29.89, p < .0001; Mean(SD) -.210(.066) vs .412(.093)], and higher in caution [F
(1,315) = 6.37, p < .05; Mean(SD) .100(.068) vs -.197(.096)] than the ’opportunist’
cluster.

The cluster analysis - Model-driven approach The cluster solution based on the
four moral philosophies of the EPT also showed an acceptable silhouette value
(.20) (see Figure 4).

Figure 4. 4-Cluster solution

The ﬁrst cluster was formed by 86 subjects, the second by 79 subjects, the
third by 77, and the fourth cluster by 75. Based on the variables distribution
within each cluster, we deﬁned the ﬁrst cluster ’legalist’, which related to the sit-
uationism moral philosophy, showing high scores in both idealism and relativism;
the second cluster ’sensible’, which related to the exceptionist moral philosophy,
showing low scores in both idealism and relativism; the third cluster ’opportunist’,
which related to the subjectivist moral philosophy, showing a low score in idealism
and a high score in relativism; the fourth cluster ’virtuous’, which related to the
absolutist moral philosophy, showing a high score in idealism and a low score in
relativism. Regarding the validity of the cluster solution, the ’legalist’, ’sensible’
and ’virtuous’ clusters showed no diﬀerences in terms of Machiavellianism and
narcissism; the ’legalist’ and ’virtuous’ cluster did not diﬀer in normativism; the
’legalist cluster did not diﬀer in idealism with respect to the ’sensible’ and ’virtu-
ous’ clusters and in relativism with respect to the ’opportunist’ cluster; then, the
’sensible’ and ’virtuous’ cluster showed no diﬀerence in terms of honesty/humility;
the other comparisons were signiﬁcant (see Table 3).

Regarding the discriminant analysis, %96.8 of original grouped cases and

%95.3 of cross-validated grouped cases were correctly classiﬁed.

3. Discussion

The present study was aimed at creating ethical proﬁles that can be predictive
of digital behaviors. Ethical proﬁles were created by two diﬀerent clustering ap-
proaches, data-driven and model-driven combining the Ethics Position Theory
(idealism and relativism) with personality (honesty/humility, conscientiousness,
Machiavellianism, and narcissism) and worldview (normativism) variables.

The analyses showed that the 2-cluster solution is actionable because it shows
an overlapping between the clusters only in terms of normativism. In addition,

the discriminant analysis showed that the original grouped cases were correctly
classiﬁed with a large percentage. As expected, the ’virtuous’ cluster tends to
commit less privacy violation and copyright infringements than the ’opportunist’
cluster. This suggests that the ’virtuous’ cluster is guided by principled values
with respect to their counterpart, which instead is more prone to violate rules
in order to achieve personal beneﬁts. This result extends to digital behaviors
previous ﬁndings concerning the ethical proﬁles in marketing negotiations[1]. In
addition, the ’virtuous’ cluster scored higher in privacy setting and information
registration on internet (caution) than the ’opportunist’ cluster. This suggests
that the ’virtuous’ cluster pay more attention, and are more cautious than the
’opportunist’ cluster.

As concerns the 4-cluster solution, although the original grouped cases were
correctly classiﬁed with a large percentage, the results showed some overlap be-
tween the ’legalist’, ’virtuous’ and ’sensible’ clusters, especially in terms of Machi-
avellianism and narcissism. Only the ’opportunist’ cluster showed higher scores
than the other 3 clusters in privacy violation and copy-right infringements. The
’legalist’ cluster showed lower scores only than the ’opportunist’ cluster in terms of
copyright infringements, suggesting that legalists pay attention to this matter as
well as sensible and virtuous people. Yet, only the ’virtuous’ cluster showed lower
scores than the ’opportunist’ cluster in caution. In general, these results show
that the ’legalist’, ’virtuous’ and ’sensible’ clusters are characterized basically by
positive attributes.

Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that the 2-cluster solution can rep-
resent a starting point for reﬁnement ethical proﬁles. The 4-cluster solution is
rather a work in progress, although it partially conﬁrmed the EPT. It should be
validated by diﬀerentiating better the clusters.

4. Conclusions and Future Work

These ﬁndings are very promising and open many directions for reﬁnements. Fu-
ture works are aimed at better disentangling not only the ’legalist’, ’sensible’ and
’virtuous’ clusters, but also the ’opportunist’ cluster in sub-clusters. This might
be achieved by considering other variables. For example, one can include other
scales measuring integrity, autenticity, dogmatism, moral disengagement, sadism,
opportunism, normlessness, and so forth. In terms of personality variables one
can add neuroticism and openness to experience. Referring to the ’virtuous’ and
’opportunist’ clusters, it would be interesting to clarify if they can be unpacked
in more speciﬁc clusters. Indeed, we used mainly moral variables and morally ori-
ented personality traits. Variables that are more oriented to measure normative
and consequential ethics, such as legalism, rationality, utilitarianism, authority,
and so forth, could also be explored. In addition, we intend to investigate if the
notion of ”semantic clustering”, for which the similarity of diﬀerent concepts in
a taxonomy is measured by computing their edge distance within the taxonomy
[5], could help when building user’s proﬁle. In order to do so, we are working to
elaborate a taxonomy out of the questionnaire data, i.e. a structure to which a
semantic distance can be applied. Having the data organized in a structured way

could also be useful for applying diﬀerent clustering techniques (such as Graph
Neural Network[59]). Finally, the ﬁndings provided by this study could be also
generalized to other digital behaviors, such as those related to social networks.
