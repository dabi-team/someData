Abstract

Background: Manganese is a paramagnetic element suitable for magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of neuronal function, however high concentrations of Mn2+ can cause
52gMn appears a valid alternative as PET (positron emis-
neurological disorders.
sion tomography) imaging agent, to obtain information similar to that delivered by
MRI but using trace levels of Mn2+, thus reducing its toxicity. Recently, the re-
action natV(α,x)52gMn has been proposed as a possible alternative to the standard
natCr(p,x)52gMn one, but improvements in the modeling were needed to better com-
pare the two production routes.
Purpose: This work focuses on the development of precise simulations and models
to compare the 52gMn production from both reactions in terms of amount of activity
and radionuclidic purity (RNP), as well as in terms of dose increase (DI) due to the
co-produced radioactive contaminants, with respect to a pure 52gMnCl2 injection.
Methods: The nuclear code Talys has been employed to optimize the natV(α,x)52gMn
cross section by tuning the parameters of the microscopic level densities. Thick target
yields have been calculated from the expression of the rates as energy convolution of
cross sections and stopping powers, and ﬁnally integrating the time evolution of the
relevant decay chains. Dosimetric assessments of [xxMn]Cl2 have been accomplished
with OLINDA software 2.2.0 using female and male phantoms. At the end, the yield
of xxMn radioisotopes estimated for the two production routes have been combined
with the dosimetric results, to assess the DI at diﬀerent times after the end of the
irradiation.
Results: Good agreement was obtained between cross sections calculations and mea-
surements. The comparison of the two reaction channels suggests that natV(α,x)52gMn
leads to higher yield and higher purity, resulting in a less harmful impact on patients’
health in terms of DI.
Conclusions: Both natV(α,x) and natCr(p,x) production routes provide clinically ac-
ceptable 52gMnCl2 for PET imaging. However, the natV(α,x)52gMn reaction provides
a DI systematically lower than the one obtainable with natCr(p,x)52gMn and a longer
time window in which it can be used clinically (RNP ≥ 99%).

Introduction

Manganese is an essential element for all beings because it participates as a cofactor in
numerous enzymatic processes. The most stable oxidation state is manganese (II), the
divalent manganese cation (Mn2+).
It behaves similarly to calcium and can be diﬀused
through voltage-gated calcium channels in the brain, heart and pancreas. Increased activity
in these tissues leads to an increased inﬂux of Mn2+; therefore, this cation can be used
to monitor cell activity 1.
In addition, manganese is a unique tool for obtaining in vivo
images of neural pathways because Mn2+ possesses strong paramagnetic properties and can
be transported along the axons in an anterograde manner and cross synapses 2. Therefore,
Mn2+ has been used to obtain manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI).
This imaging technique enables early detection of neuronal function, intracellular ion balance,
and axonal transport; nevertheless, it has not been widely used in clinical practice since the
high doses of Mn2+ have been found to lead to a neurological disorder called manganism,
with psychiatric and neurological syndromes similar to those of the Parkinson’s disease 3.
Positron emission tomography (PET) oﬀers superior contrast sensitivity compared to MRI
and allows all typical information from MEMRI to be obtained using trace levels of Mn2+
thus minimizing its toxic eﬀects 4. Several radioisotopes of manganese have been studied as
radiotracers for PET imaging 5. Among them 52gMn appears the most suitable for this scope
because it decays with a low maximum positron energy of about 0.6 MeV, that makes PET
imaging resolution similar to that of 18F 1. In addition, 52gMn half-life (t1/2 = 5.6 day) is
long enough for in vivo imaging of cell tracking at time points as long as days or even weeks
post-injection 6.

The best known production route is based on the reaction natCr(p,x)52gMn. El Sayed
et al 7 recently measured the cross-sections of 52gMn, and the co-produced contaminants
54Mn and 51Cr with the goal of optimizing the routine production of 52gMn. Experimen-
tal data were in good agreement with calculations obtained using the standard simulations
with TALYS code 8, and with previously published data.
In addition cross-section data
were useful to improve the available nuclear data sets for each radionuclide involved. Re-
cently, our group proposed an alternative reaction natV(α,x)52gMn with potentially higher
yield and better radionuclidic purity 9. The study involved also considerations on the use of
enriched targets which perform more eﬃciently but require more expensive materials and
complicated target-recovery approaches. The study revealed that the experimental data sets
for the natV(α,x)52gMn reaction are very scattered and need to be improved, and that the
standard simulations with nuclear reaction codes, such as TALYS, FLUKA and EMPIRE,
are not fully adequate. In this work the outcomes of FLUKA and EMPIRE codes are not
taken into account since they do not provide an easy way to vary the parameters of their
models. Instead, the study exploited the speciﬁc versatility of TALYS, which incorporates
six diﬀerent level-density models (three phenomenological and three based on microscopic
theories) and four diﬀerent pre-equilibrium approaches (three based on the exciton model 10
and one on the fully quantum-mechanical multi-step approach 11). The multiple combination
suggested a statistical treatment of the model variability, that leads to consider an inter-
quartile band covering the area between the 25% and 75% percentiles of the entire set of

ii

possible calculations. This band gives and estimation of the spread (or theoretical indeter-
mination, or ”error”) one gets for selecting one model instead of another one of the whole
set. The median line of this inter-quartile band was chosen as the most representative line
of the statistical assortment of calculations and the half width of the band was taken as an
indication of the expected theoretical error. However, this approach to the natV(α,x)52gMn
production cross-section 9 was not optimal, since all the considered TALYS calculations had
the tendency to shift the peak at lower energy, and slightly overestimate its maximum value.
On the other hand, the spread of the experimental data appears too large for attempting
a reliable evaluation of the cross section using interpolation techniques. In this work, we
found a way to optimize the description of this cross-section using the microscopic models
incorporated into the TALYS code, and by tuning the nuclear level density parameters of the
52Mn compound. The procedure follows an approach developed recently for the optimization
of the natV(p,x)47Sc cross section 12 and described in II.A..

In view of possible applications of manganese radionuclides in medical imaging, it is
important to assess the impact of the produced radionuclides in terms of dose released to
the patient, including the contribution of the radioisotopic contaminants. The fraction of
co-produced contaminants characterizes the production route and represents a signiﬁcant
indicator to compare diﬀerent approaches. De Nardo et al. analyzed the eﬀective dose bur-
den due to the use of 52gMn as brain tracer under the simple MnCl2 chemical compound
with computational dosimetry codes 13.
It was found that the radiation dose released by
52gMn may be quite signiﬁcant due to its relatively long physical half-life and the emission
of high-energy γ rays. The main focus of that publication was a comparison of the dosi-
metric properties of 52gMn and 51Mn, a shorter half-life positron emitter (t1/2 = 45.59 min,
β+=97.1%, E(β+) avg = 970.2 keV), also suitable for PET imaging, despite its lower spa-
tial resolution characteristics compared to 52gMn. In this work, the main interest was the
assessment of the quality of the produced 52gMn, not only in terms of radionuclidic purity,
but also by considering the dose increase due to the presence of radioisotopic contaminants,
which remain in the ﬁnal product because chemical puriﬁcation is not possible. For these
reasons, dosimetric calculations have been extended to [xxMn]Cl2 labelled with the Mn ra-
dioisotopic impurities expected to be co-produced by the nuclear reactions investigated for
52gMn production.

II. Methods

II.A. Cross-section and yield evaluations

The TALYS code was used to improve the model reproduction of the dataset, following the
approach discussed previously by our group 12 and herein described in details for the cross
section natV(α,x)52gMn. To this aim, the level density model based on microscopic Hartree-
Fock-Bogoliubov theory with the Gogny force, incorporating a temperature dependence in
the level density 14, has been considered. This model is denoted as ldmodel 6 and is the latest
level density model implemented in the TALYS code. Concerning the optical model, we have

iii

adopted the default options for the nucleon-nucleus optical model and for the α-nucleus opti-
cal potential, corresponding to the model reported by Avrigeanu et al 15. The pre-equilibrium
reaction mechanisms were incorporated using the exciton model, where the diﬀerent exciton
states were coupled with transition rates calculated numerically starting from the imaginary
part of the optical potential. This references to preeqmode 3 in the TALYS code. With
this selection of models, and following the approach reported previously 12, the tabulated
microscopic level density of the ldmodel 6 has been parameterized according to the following
transformation

ρ(E, J, π) = exp(c

E − p)ρHF (E − p, J, π) ,

(1)

q

where ρHF (E, J, π) is the level density from the microscopic Hartree-Fock calculation. The
c and p parameters have to be optimized to obtain a cross-section in better agreement
with the data and this has been performed by introducing a two-dimension search grid that
minimizes the discrepancies between calculated and measured cross sections. Once the cross
section optimization has been performed, it is important also to check its impact on the level
density by comparing the resulting level cumulatives with the ones derived experimentally 16
(see section III.A.).

The optimized cross section can be employed to evaluate the number of radionuclides
produced under speciﬁc irradiation conditions, and from there activities, yields, and purities.
The computational approach considered has been extensively discussed by Canton et al 17
and outlined here for simplicity.

First, the most promising energy window for the production of 52gMn at low contami-
nation shall be identiﬁed. The rate R of production of a radionuclide from a beam colliding
on a target with a certain thickness can be derived from the expression

R =

I0
zproj|e|

Na
A Z

Ein

Eout

σ(E)

−1

dE
ρtdx !

dE ,

(2)

where I0 is the beam current, zproj is 2 for a completely ionized 4He beam, e the electron
charge, Na the Avogadro number, A the atomic mass of the target element, Ein and Eout the
energy of the beam hitting the target and the one leaving the target after traveling through
its thickness, respectively. σ(E) is the production cross section for the nuclide, ρt the target
density and dE/dx the stopping power of the projectile in the target, calculated with the
Bethe-Bloch formula 18.

Once the rate for all the Mn radionuclides of interest are calculated, the time evolution
of the number of nuclei, and hence the activity of a speciﬁc radionuclide can be obtained,
during and after the irradiation, by means of standard treatment of the decay evolution
of each isotope through the Bateman equations. Each considered manganese radionuclide
decays to diﬀerent chemical elements, except 52mMn, which decays in 52gMn with a branching
ratio of 1.75% and with a 21.1 minutes half-life. The main decay data of interest for the
present analysis are reported in tables 1 and 2. These data were extracted with the software
package DECDATA provided by the ICRP 107 publication 19.

II.B. Organ absorbed doses and eﬀective dose due to xxMnCl2 in-

jection

Biodistribution data in healthy mice after 52gMnCl2 injection 20 were used as input for dosi-
metric calculations. The percent of injected activity per gram of tissue ([% IA/g]A) in the
main source organs (heart, liver, kidneys, muscle, pancreas and salivary gland) were used
to evaluate the percent of injected activity into human organs ([% IA/organ]H) through the
relative mass scaling method 21:

%IA
organ !H

=

%IA

g !A (cid:18)

OWH
T BWH (cid:19)

T BWA

(3)

where OWH is the human organ weight and TBWA and TBWH are the average total
body weight for animal and human, respectively. For each source organ these data were
plotted as a function of the post-injection (p.i.) time, from 1 to 13 days, and ﬁtted to a tri-
exponential equation, representing the phase of accumulation, retention and elimination of
MnCl2, with CoKiMo software 22. The number of disintegrations in each source organ due to
52gMnCl2 injection was calculated by integration of the respective activity curve, considering
the physical half-life of 52gMn radioisotope. Similar calculations were performed for the other
Mn radioisotopes expected to be co-produced by the investigated nuclear reactions. Activity
in the non-source organs, or remaining organs, was estimated by ﬁrst assessing the total
number of disintegrations in the body, on the base of human biological half-life stated by
Mahoney et al. 23, and then subtracting to this number the number of disintegrations already
ascribed to the source organs. This hypothesis is fundamental to properly assess the dose in
the case of radioisotopes with a prolonged physical half-life, as already demonstrated in the
case of 52MnCl2 in a previous publication on this subject 13. Absorbed dose calculations were
performed with the OLINDA (Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment) software code version
2.2.0 24,25, based on the RADAR method for internal dose estimation 26 and the realistic
NURBS-type male and female models 27, based on the standardized masses deﬁned by ICRP
89 28. For each xxMn radioisotope, the eﬀective dose coeﬃcient, EDxxM n was obtained as the
sum of the product of the organ equivalent dose per unit of administered activity, DxxM n
organ ,
and the respective tissue-weighting factor, worgan, recommended by ICRP 103 29,

Finally, the total absorbed dose coeﬃcient for diﬀerent organs and the total eﬀective
dose coeﬃcient (EDtot) of MnCl2, including the contribution of each xxMn radioisotope, were
calculated at the diﬀerent times after EOB, using the following equations:

where fxxM n(t) is the fraction of total activity corresponding to each radioisotope at the time

(RNP)

f52gM n(t) =

A52gM n(t)

.

The evaluation of the dose increase (DI) due to the presence of radiogenic impurities in the

production route is introduced according to the following equation

and represents the ratio between the total eﬀective dose (i.e., including the impurities) and
the eﬀective dose due to an ideal injection of pure 52gMn.

III. Results

III.A. Cross sections

With the selection of models discussed in section II.A., it was found necessary to optimize
only the two level-density parameters with respect to the 52Mn compound, with the following
values: c = 0.0 MeV−1/2 and p = −1.0 MeV. In practice, the c = 0.0 MeV−1/2 implies that no
normalization factor has been introduced with respect to the original microscopic Hartree-
Fock level density, while a shift of 1 MeV has been applied towards higher energies, that
could originate from shell-model or pairing eﬀects. The resulting cross section is reported
in ﬁgure 1 by the solid line which represents a signiﬁcant improvement with respect to the
dashed line reporting the calculation adopted by Colombi et al 9. It must be added that,
in the current result, the selection of the speciﬁc pre-equilibrium model with transition
rates derived from the imaginary part of the optical potential was instrumental to correctly
reproduce the cross-section at higher energies, in the region above 40 MeV. The standard
models lead to a signiﬁcant underestimation of the higher-energy data, as suggested also
from the dash-dot line in ﬁgure 1. The available experimental data 30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40
reported in the ﬁgure were taken from the EXFOR database 41.

Contaminant radioisotopes produced by this reaction route are characterized either by a
very short, or by a very long, half-life. In particular, 48Mn, 49Mn, 50g/mMn, 51Mn, and 52mMn
have half-lives shorter than one hour and their contamination, both in terms of isotopic and
radionuclidic purity, are negligible just after a few hours. The stable 55Mn is produced in the
electromagnetic channel with very low yield, and the quasi stable 53Mn (half-life ∼ 3.6×106
years) does not aﬀect the radionuclidic purity in a signiﬁcant way. Finally, we are left with
the contaminant 54Mn, with an intermediate half-life of about 312 days. This could represent
an obstacle limiting the radionuclidic purity of the production route.

The cross-section for natV(α,x)54Mn is shown in ﬁgure 2, and the comparison between
model and experimental data previously reported 35,37,38,39,40,42,43,44,45 is quite satisfactory.

Figure 1: 52gMn cross section for the natV case, comparing the available experimental data
and two theoretical curves: the newly TALYS optimized curve (solid line) and the one used
by Colombi et al. (dash-dot line).
The calculations are rather stable with respect to the model variations in TALYS, while the
experimental data are spread within a 30% variability around the peak region. One must
observe, however, that the relevant production region for 52gMn is around 40 MeV, where the
production of 54Mn is limited by the smallness of the corresponding cross section. Moreover,
in this energy region, the data dispersion and the model variability are remarkably reduced.

In ﬁgure 3 the comparison between the experimental cumulative of the number of levels
and the theoretical ones is shown for the nuclide of interest. In particular, the green curve is
the standard theoretical HFB cumulative, with both parameters equal to zero. The black one
is obtained by considering the values of c and p tabulated in TALYS, for the option ldmodel
6, while the blue curve refers to the cumulative found in this work with the parameters
associated to the optimized cross section. This solution seems in general to overestimate the
trend of the cumulative and, in particular, in better agreement with data in the lower energy
region. It is worth noting that the variation of the c and p parameters was not intended for
a good description of nuclear level cumulatives. Rather, it has been carried out to optimize
the agreement with the experimental cross section, since this is crucial for more accurate
estimates of yields and purities in view of the speciﬁc nuclear applications described in this
work.

adopted the newly optimized TALYS calculation for the cross section, discussed in II.A.,
which are more reliable than those derived by Colombi et al 9. Instead, for the natCr target,
the same cross sections calculated previously 9 were used, since they turned out already
reliable for the corresponding thick-target yield evaluation.

The two targets have been selected both with a 200 µm thickness, corresponding for the
natV target to the α-beam energy window 48–33.9 MeV, while for natCr to the 17–14 MeV
range for the proton beam. The 200 µm thick target refers to a standard thickness suitable in
both cases, and the corresponding energy ranges are selected to reduce the contamination.
In table 3 the activity produced through the two routes are compared. The yields are
similar, however the case α-natV is signiﬁcantly better, particularly for the smaller production
of the long-lived 54Mn. The expected production of 51Mn is slightly larger, however this
radionuclide is short lived, with an half-life of 46 min, and can be eliminated with a few
hours of cooling.

the use of α on natV target provides yields with smaller contribution of the main contaminant,
54Mn.

III.C. Dosimetric calculations for xxMnCl2

The organ activity curves obtained after ﬁtting the percent of injected activity in the main
source organs, [% IA/organ]H, calculated for male and female models through equation (3),
evidenced that Mn2+ shows a fast uptake for all the organs, followed by a slow wash-out,
except for the salivary gland, where uptake remains quite stable. The number of disintegra-
tions in the source organs per MBq of injected activity of xxMnCl2, obtained after integration
of the organ activity curves, are reported in table 4 for each radioisotope. The activity re-
ported by Hernandez et al 20 as [%IA/g] in “heart/blood” was assigned to “heart wall” and
“heart contents” using equation (3) and the respective masses. As shown in table 4, for
each radioisotope, the organ with the highest number of disintegrations is the liver, followed
by the kidneys for the radionuclides with the shortest half-life (51Mn and 52gMn), by the
salivary glands for the long-lived radionuclides 53Mn and 54Mn, due to the slow wash-out in
this organ. Considering a total-body biological clearance based on the data of Mahoney and
Small 23, the calculated number of disintegrations in the remaining organs clearly increases
with the physical half-life of the radioisotope.

Table 4: Number of nuclear transitions (MBq-hr/MBq) in source organs per MBq of
xxMnCl2, for female and male ICRP 89 phantoms.

For unit activity of each radioisotope and for both male and female phantoms, data
of table 4 were used to calculate the absorbed doses to the organs and the ED based on
ICRP 103 29 tissue weighting factors. Results are presented in table 5. The organs receiving
the highest doses are the kidneys, followed by the pancreas and the liver, in the case of
51MnCl2, the pancreas, followed by the kidneys and liver, for 52gMnCl2, both for male and
female phantoms. The absorbed dose values obtained with the diﬀerent radioisotopes are
clearly correlated to their main decay data for dosimetric interest, reported in tables 1 and 2.
Absorbed doses to diﬀerent organs are 50-200 and 55-235 fold higher for 52gMnCl2 compared
to 51MnCl2, respectively for male and female. This is due to the higher energy emitted
by 52gMn per nuclear transformation (nt), 3.5335 MeV/nt, compared to 1.9321 MeV/nt for
51Mn 19, and its longer half-life (see table 1).
In the case of both 53MnCl2 and 54MnCl2,
the organ receiving the highest dose becomes the salivary glands. For these long half-lives
radioisotopes the absorbed dose to the other organs becomes almost uniform, due to the
preponderant contribution of total body irradiation (see the number of counts in Remain-
ing organs in table 4). Despite the long half-life of 53Mn, organ absorbed doses due to

xi

53MnCl2 are comparable to those due to 51MnCl2, due to the very low radiation emission of
this radioisotope, 0.0053 MeV/nt (ICRP107) (see table 1, 2). The total energy emitted per
54Mn decay is about 4 times lower compared to 52gMn due to the absence of high-energy
gamma emission, therefore organ absorbed doses due to 54MnCl2 are only slightly higher
than those due to 52gMnCl2 despite the quite longer half life of 54Mn. As already reported
for other radiopharmaceuticals 46, organ absorbed doses are in general about 20% higher for
female than for male, resulting in increased ED values between 33 and 38%, depending on
the radioisotope. As already reported in our previous publication 13, the ED values due to
51MnCl2 injection are quite low and comparable to the ED of 18F-FDG (0.0192 mSv/MBq;
gender-averaged value) 26, and about two orders of magnitude lower than those of 52gMnCl2.
The ED values due to 53MnCl2 are less than a factor 3 higher than those due to 51MnCl2,
while those of 54MnCl2 are about a factor 1.5 higher than those due to 52MnCl2.

IV. Discussion

In this work two production routes for 52gMn have been compared, the standard low-energy
natCr(p,x) and the alternative intermediate-energy natV(α,x) one, disregarded in the past
reviews, and proposed only very recently. The former route has very consistent cross sec-
tion data which are well reproduced by standard nuclear reaction codes such as TALYS,
FLUKA, and EMPIRE, while the latter has measured data quite scattered and the standard
nuclear reaction calculations do not perform so well. To improve the comparison, an opti-
mized calculation within the TALYS code has been developed where the parameters of the
nuclear level densities in the microscopic Hartree-Fock formalism have been adjusted to the
measured cross sections. In addition, the exciton-based pre-equilibrium model that better
described the higher energy tail of the cross section has been selected. Considering this new
optimized cross-section, the comparative study between the two production routes, already
performed by Colombi et al. 9, has been repeated and extended also to evaluate the eﬀective
doses imparted to simulated phantoms. To ensure the safety of a radiopharmaceutical, the
production methods should generate a minimal amount of radiogenic contaminants. The
European Pharmacopoeia requires a radionuclidic purity limit of 99% 47.
In general, the
time range that satisﬁes this requirement is reported in Tab.6 for the two production routes.
The lower time limit is due to the 51Mn fast decay, the upper one to the slow decay of 52gMn.
The comparison shows a longer time interval that matches the RNP limit for the natV case,
and this is due to a larger production of 52gMn and a lower 54Mn contamination, as can be
inspected also from ﬁgure 4. The large production of the short-lived 51Mn aﬀects the purity
only in the short term, while the 53Mn has a negligible impact well beyond the time inter-
val of interest. On the other hand 51Mn could be considered an additional (fast-decaying)
radionuclide for PET diagnostics 48 to be used in co-prodution with 52gMn.

It is not suﬃcient to verify the fraction of radionuclidic impurities, but it is essential
to quantify also the dose increase due to the presence of these impurities. Nowadays, there
is not an established limit for the DI, but in general 10% is considered a good starting
value 49,50. The DI obtained for both production routes considering the anthropomorphic
OLINDA phantoms are plotted in ﬁgure 5 vs. the time between EOB and injection. In both
cases the DI increases with time, however the use of α particles on natV targets guarantees
a signiﬁcantly longer time window where the total eﬀective dose is less than 110% with
respect to an hypothetical pure 52gMn injection. The time range satisfying this condition
is reported in table 6. The RNP limits, however, result in more stringent conditions than
those obtained with the DI as also put in evidence in ﬁgure 5, showing the time range set
from the RNP limits for both production routes and represented by the two horizontal bars.
The DI obtained in the hypothesis of injecting 52gMnCl2 within the 99% time window is
lower than 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively for natV and natCr targets. It should however be
remembered that the results concerning the DI are speciﬁc for each radiopharmaceutical,
being dependent on its biokinetics.

V. Conclusions

An improvement in the model reproduction of the natV(α,x)52gMn cross section, based on
parameter optimization relevant for the nuclear level densities, allowed to make a more pre-
cise comparison between two production routes for the PET tracer 52gMn. The comparison
between the natCr(p,x) and the alternative intermediate-energy natV(α,x) production routes
conﬁrms that the use of natural vanadium targets leads to higher yield and higher RNP. The
comparison has been extended to the dosimetric impact due to the injection of the tracer
52gMnCl2 to speciﬁc phantoms, taking into account the eﬀect of the co-produced radionu-
clides 51Mn, 53Mn, and 54Mn. Assessments of the total doses imparted to the organs have
been obtained, both in case of pure injection of one of the four radionuclides, as well as in
case of mixtures expected from the modeling of the two production routes. Eﬀective doses

xiv

 
generated by the total doses over all organs, weighted by the appropriate tissue sensitivities,
have been calculated and henceforth the dose increase, which describes the impact of the con-
taminants implied by the production route, has been derived. For both production routes,
the DI is well within the 10% limit for the entire range where the RNP is acceptable (i.e.
greater than 99%). Again, the natV(α,x)52gMn reaction provides a DI systematically lower
than the one obtainable with natCr(p,x)52gMn, underlining the advantageous characteristics
of the former reaction.

Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that the use of α particles at intermediate ener-
gies requires more complex (and less widespread) facilities than those providing low-energy
proton beams, which can be provided by standard hospital cyclotrons. Finally, the discus-
sion has been limited here to the use of natural targets which are easily available and usually
inexpensive. It is known that the use of enriched targets may improve the purity and yields,
particularly in the Cr case, however this requires more expensive materials and additional
complexity for target-recovery techniques.
