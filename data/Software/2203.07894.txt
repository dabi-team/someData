Abstract: The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has threaten the face-to-face
teaching activity in both schools and universities. The transformation from face-to-face
classes to online activities yielded ineﬃcient outcomes from the activities. Particularly, a
key issue was organizing laboratory activities without accessing the labs. In this paper,
we propose how to overcome this problem by enabling the students to perform physics
experiments of ﬂuid draining at home. In other words, the use of equipment commonly
available at home or that can be purchased at a low price is practically plausible. In the
present work, we do an experimental investigation of liquid draining through a hole of a
container. From an analyzing step, we introduce a freely-accessible video analysis software,
Tracker, to obtain accurate results. Interestingly, we observe the eﬀects of viscosity causing
a delay of draining time of liquids. Our study shows that a ratio of open-space radius of
the container to the hole radius,

λ, can be used to determine a draining time.

The COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted face-to-face Physics lab course at university and
has transformed them to online courses. It is challenging for physics instructors worldwide,
in designing labs for undergraduate students to meet their proﬁciency. In late 2021, during
the forth wave of COVID-19 of Thailand, we organized Physics Laboratory II course for
engineering students. All 243 students had to study from home. Since previous course in
Physics Laboratory I, all labs we served for our students were mainly rely on virtual labs,
this second course we intended to arrange more hands-on labs. However The hands-on
labs are based on the utilization of household items, similar to what have done by other
universities [1].

One of our hands-on labs is exploration of the speed of eﬄux. In this lab, the students
were assigned to calculate ratio of cross-sectional areas of a bottle to a leakage, and an
initial height of water in the bottle. The students conduct the experiment with just ordinary
equipment, e.g. a used transparent plastic bottle, a stopwatch and camera installed in their
smartphone, a ruler, and tap water. Due to individual performing experiment, it prevents
them from having precise time reckoning. As a result, a number of the students obtained
signiﬁcant errors in data analysis. To avoid signiﬁcant errors in data analysis for the
next academic year, we thus have introduced a VDO frame-based analysis software, called
Tracker. In this proposed lad, we not only consider water but also choose oil as an another
example of ﬂuid into the lab. With an assist of Tracker and the use of diﬀerent types of
liquid, we hope that our students will be able to obtain more accurate data and to observe
eﬀects of density and viscosity to Bernoulli’s and Poiseuille’s laws. Before establishment of
this new lab, we carried out a pilot experimental study to validate our method and accuracy
of the experimental results.

In this paper, we propose a new development of the speed of eﬄux lab. With a com-
mon plastic bottle and a free Tracker software, this lab enables students to conduct the

– 1 –

experiment at home. Moreover, it brings more accurate measuring data to obtain a precise
prediction of parameters such as the size of a small leakage hole and terminal time of ﬂuid
ﬂow. In Sec.2, we revisit the mathematical formulation of the underlying description via the
Bernoulli’s equation to describe the behavior of the ﬂow. A vital component of our formal
setup is given in Sec.3. Here it is rather straightforward, and helps students to establish
the proper thought process. In Sec.4, we show the results and discuss our ﬁndings. Finally,
we conclude in the last section.

2 Mathematical Formalism of Underlying Theory

Historically, Swiss physicist Daniel Bernoulli had ﬁrst described the relationship between
ﬂuid speed, pressure, and elevation which is nowadays well known as the Bernoulli’s equation
[2]. The equation plays a key role when one wants to describe the ideal ﬂuid, i.e., the steady
and in-compressible ﬂow of non-viscous ﬂuids. We start considering the energy conservation
of energy of the laminar ﬂow. Firstly, we assume that the origin of coordinates is at the
center of the oriﬁce. As illustrated in Fig.1, we label a position on the free surface of
the liquid with “ 1 ” , and use “ 2 ” to represent a position of a hole in which the origin of
coordinates is located. Subsequently, we apply Bernoulli’s equation to describe the behavior
of the ﬂow and write the total mechanical energy per volume as Eq.(2.1).

diswhere P1 and P2 represent the pressure at the free surface (1) and at an oriﬁce (2),
respectively, both equal to Pa, ρ is the density of ﬂuid which is constant. The free surface
has the speed of v1 and the speed of eﬄux is denoted by v2, g represents the gravitational
acceleration. The height of the ﬂuid vertically varies at the point 1 of an initial height of
H = H0 and at any time with y1 as shown in Fig.1 and y2 is zero which is the point of the

origin of coordinates. Therefore, Eq.(2.1) reduces to

For an ideal ﬂuid ﬂow that the volume ﬂux is constant, we can write

(2.3)

where A1 and A2 are cross-sectional areas of the bottle and the pierced hole, respectively.
Now, we consider v1 and recast it in terms of v1 = dH/dt. Substituting the result into
Eq.(2.2), we obtain v2:

where λ is denoted as a ratio of A2 to A1. A negative sign in front of Eq.(2.5) implies a

where H0 is the initial height of the free surface. If the cross-section area of the bottle is
much greater than that of the area of the oriﬁce (A1 (cid:29) A2), we ﬁnd that 1 − λ2 is equal to

In the present study, the above approximation will be veriﬁed by our experiments of ﬂuid
draining.

3 Material & Method

To study the speed of eﬄux using Bernoulli’s equation, transparent plastic bottles–cylindrical
shape were pierced by using a hot metal pin to make a hole in its side near the bottom.
Diﬀerent diameters of each draining hole and two ﬂuids that are water and cooking oil,
were used to result the speed of eﬄux. A piece of sticky tape was put over the oriﬁce and
then ﬁlled the mixed-blue dye water to enhance visibility of water in the bottle. The oriﬁce
was opened to record the ﬂow rate on video ﬁles by using a smartphone as shown in Fig.2.
Distance between the plastic bottle the camera is approximately 1 meter that is enough to
ignore the distorted image of the image of a smartphone lens [3]. Decreasing water level
in the container analyzed using open-source software ‘Tracker’. For instance, decreasing oil
level as a function of time in the container was determined by Tracker as shown in Fig.3.
We used Eq.(2.6) to determine a = 0.5gλ2, b = −(cid:112)2gλ2H0, and H0. All results are shown
in Tab.1 and 2.

time points, and (bottom-right panel) a table of the vertical displacements at diﬀerent time points.

After tracking times of drain (t) and height (H) of the liquids by using Tracker, height-
time graph of diﬀerent hole-sizes was plotted as shown in Fig 4. In every test, each liquid
was ﬁlled up to the level of big cross-sectional area A1 at about 18.5 cm, above the small

time of the liquids from individual hole-sizes. In Fig 4, draining time of water and oil at
particular hole-sizes from inertial level are approximately the same, before splitting away
from each other at about H = 15 cm. The splitting of draining time can be observed from

– 5 –

the oriﬁces R1, R2 and R3 of radii 0.16, 0.22 and 0.28 cm, respectively. In case of bigger
radii 0.40, 0.52 and 0.83 cm of the oriﬁces R4, R5 and R6, water is comparable to oil along
the course of draining.

Gradient of the height-time graph (Fig 4) was computed and translated the graph into
acceleration of leak, as shown in Fig 5. Due to a density of water higher than that of oil,
the high pressure formulates a higher speed of eﬄux that can be observed at the early time
of every hole-size. Each liquid ﬂows from the highest level to the lower one resulting in a
dropping of pressure, and then the reducing of a speed. This results are in good agreement
with the work done by Sianoudis and Drakaki [4]. We consider a case of viscosity and
resistance of the ﬂuid taking into account. At the smallest hole R1, after 60 s, as a more
oil left in the bottle, pressure of the oil is higher and therefore it ﬂows faster than the
water. For instant at 63 second, pressure of the oil is 2 Pascal higher than that of the water.
Nevertheless, the oil to drain oﬀ after the water. According to eﬀects of high viscosity of
the oil–friction among its molecules and friction between its molecules and the hole [5],
it converts some amount of kinetic energy into thermal energy. Consequently, the water
ﬂows with a higher deceleration when compare to the oil. These eﬀects are dominantly
present to the three smallest holes R1, R2 and R3. In case of R4, R5 and R6, their radii
are suﬃciently large to disregard friction due to hole-size eﬀect [6].

The ﬁt of parabolic function to height-time graph (Fig 4) allows us to parametrize a
and b which are macroscopic quantities that contain constant terms, λ, and H0 in Eq.(2.7).
Parameters a and b in Table 1 and 2 indicate that acceleration of the free surface (A1)
increases with the hole-size, while initial velocity of the free space decreases. In this work,
radius of the holes Rex, initial height of liquids H0 at t = 0 and terminal time of draining
are also veriﬁed. Since a = 0.5gλ2 = 0.5g(A2/A1)2 = 0.5g(R2/R1)4, R2 = R1(2a/g)1/4,
substitution of radius R1 = 4.44 cm gives radius of the hole. Radius Rex obtained from
calculation is smaller than the radius Rmeas measured by using vernier caliper with less
than 20 percent of diﬀerence. The diﬀerence is possibly due to uneven circumference of
the hole occurred from burning in piecing process. The initial height of liquids H0 obtains
from b2R4
2, or from the last term in Eq.(2.7). The initial height of liquid from our
experiment diﬀers from our measurement less than 1 percent of diﬀerence. Regarding to ﬁt
data, the zero gradient provides us drain oﬀ time. The bigger the hole is, the faster liquid
will reach its terminal time.

5 Conclusion

In this work, we have performed experimental investigation of liquid draining through a
hole of a container. We developed this experiment with intention to propose it to be a lab
at home. The use of equipment commonly available at home or that can be purchased at a
low price. We have introduced a freely-accessible video analysis software , Tracker, to assist
us in a process of data analysis to obtain accurate results.

Interestingly, we observed eﬀects of viscosity causing a delay of draining time of liquids.
Resistant force according to the viscosity converts some kinetic energy of moving liquid
into thermal energy resulting in a reduction of ﬂow speed [6]. Our study showed that a
ratio of the oriﬁce radius to the free surface radius (R2/R1) can be used to determine a
terminal time. The greater ratio is, the slower terminal time is obtained. Moreover, we have
found a proportional relation of (R2/R1)4 to acceleration of declining level of liquid in the
container. These behaviors are corresponding to Poiseuille’s law, and in a good agreement
with a previous study [4]. However, the eﬀect of hole size has been only observed for small
holes.

Following ﬂuid dynamics principles and a mathematical function, we obtained Eq.(2.7)
written in a standard parabolic form. This measures a change of liquid level as a func-
tion of time. Disclosure of coeﬃcients of parabolic function ﬁts to our experimental data
demonstrating that a quadratic coeﬃcient "a" and a linear one "b" are interpreted as an
acceleration and an initial velocity of liquid in the container, respectively. The terms of a
ratio (R2/R1)4 and an initial level of liquid in the container are concealed in the coeﬃcients
determining the instantaneous height of liquid left in the container. In addition, following
our experimental approach, ones can examine a hole-size, quantify an initial height of liquid
in a container, and estimate the terminal time of draining in actual situation.

Our experiment related to ﬂuid mechanics possibly implements in fundamental physics
laboratory course for freshmen either in engineering or in science program. We believe that
this experimental template integrated with computer assisted data analysis software will
valuable to various educational aspects, including; 1) improvement for increase students’
hands-on involvement. Experience with hands-on experiment through trial and error allows
the students observe physics phenomena, learn from mistakes, and distinguish gap between

– 7 –

theory and practice, 2) enhancement of students’ understanding in basic ﬂuid mechanics
principles to be able to apply the knowledge for solving practical problems, 3) adaptation
of using Tracker software enabling students or any experimenters to accurately analyze
moving objects in other experiments, such as tracking ﬂow of ﬂuid to observe velocity
distribution across and along a pipe, tracking trajectory of projectile, 4) elimination of fund
limitation to purchase practical experimental equipment and barriers to distance learning,
and 5) advancement of STEM/STEAM education to students. Our proposed laboratory
enables students to transfer their knowledge across disciplines that are physics, engineering,
mathematics, technological tool of analysis software, and art in the experiment. Last but
not least, our proposed scenario, based on a lab@home strategy, constitutes the doable
template for teachers/students to setup, perform, and analyse other physics experiments at
home.

A Lab@home guide

The proposed lab of ﬂuid draining contains 3 processes; preparation, recording, and ana-
lyzing. All the processes consume about 3 hours. In preparation process, according to our
pilot study, we would suggest an experimenter to use at least 3 transparent plastic bottles
of the same shape and dimension. They can be reused ones. Discrete hole sizes can be made
by pressing diﬀerent sizes of hot metal pins onto the plastic bottles, and moving the tool
around into a circle to get rid of uneven edge. Fluids such as water, cooking oil, salt water,
glycerine, etc.can be applied in this experiment. To enhance visibility of water level, a small
drop of dye can be dissolved into it. Video record can be achieved by using a camera from
either a smartphone, or a professional one. A stable smartphone or camera holder such as a
tripod, table, chair, etc. and a bright room are recommended for obtaining a good quality
VDO shot. The last thing to prepare is a computer (or laptop/tablet) with installation of
Tracker software from https://physlets.org/tracker/ and spreadsheet application. Besides,

– 8 –

the Tracker software is possible to run online. All in this part would take about an hour to
get ready for the next part of tracking.

Tracker software requires an input of frame rate and a visible known length in a recorded
VDO frame. The frame rate can be found in device speciﬁc data. In case of unknown frame
rate, the experimenter may test it via online tool available on the Internet. In laboratory,
frame rate can be counted by using stroboscope. The known length as a ruler is suggested
to present in VDO recording for calibration of distance. During ﬂowing out of the small
hole, height of ﬂuid levels have to be tracked at certain times. Tracking point should not
less than 20 points distributed through out the ﬂow, equivalent to 5 step size. Process of
tracking data might consume an hour.

Data obtained from Tracker software feasibly export or copy to a spreadsheet applica-
tion such as Excel, Number, Google Sheet, etc., enabling the experimenter to calculate, plot
and ﬁt the data. Height-Time graphs of particular ﬂowing liquids out of varied hole sizes
assist the experimenter to ﬁnd drain oﬀ time and parametrize a and b for determination
of initial height of water in the bottle, H0 and size of the leakage Rex. Gradient of the
height-time graphs is interpreted as speed of eﬄux-time graph analogous to liquid acceler-
ation of the ﬂow. The best-ﬁt parabola to height-time data of the form at2 + bt + c, given
in Eq.(2.7), yields a and b coeﬃcients to quantify H0 and ratio of open surfaces A2 to A1
from λ, respectively. With a known area, the experimenter is able to compute another one.
In process of data analysis, the experimenter would spend about an hour in our proposed
lab.
