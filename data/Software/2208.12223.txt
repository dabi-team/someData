Abstract. In this paper, we introduce the SAP Signavio Academic Mod-
els (SAP-SAM) dataset, a collection of hundreds of thousands of busi-
ness models, mainly process models in BPMN notation. The model col-
lection is a subset of the models that were created over the course of
roughly a decade on academic.signavio.com, a free-of-charge software-
as-a-service platform that researchers, teachers, and students can use to
create business (process) models. We provide a preliminary analysis of
the model collection, as well as recommendations on how to work with it.
In addition, we discuss potential use cases and limitations of the model
collection from academic and industry perspectives.

Introduction

Process models depict how organizations conduct their operations. They rep-
resent the basis for understanding, analyzing, redesigning, and automating pro-
cesses along the business process management (BPM) lifecycle [9]. As such, many
organizations posses large repositories of process models [11]. Having access to
such repositories would be tremendously beneﬁcial for developing and testing
algorithms in the area of BPM, e.g., for process model querying [19] or refer-
ence model mining [20]. Also, the growing interest in applying machine learning
in the BPM ﬁeld, e.g., for process model matching [1], process model abstrac-
tion [27] or process modeling assistance [24], underlines the relevance for large
model collections that can, for example, serve as training datasets.

However, researchers rarely have access to large collections of models from
practice. Such models can contain sensitive information about the organization’s
internal operations. Legal aspects and the fear of losing competitive advantage
thus discourage companies from publishing their business (process) models [25].
This inherent dilemma has so far largely prevented the publication of large-scale
model collections for research, as they are common in related research ﬁelds [25].

In this paper, we introduce SAP Signavio Academic Models (SAP-SAM), a
model collection that consists of hundreds of thousands of process and business
models in diﬀerent notations. We provide a basic overview of datasets related
to SAP-SAM, as well as the origin and structure of it. Subsequently, we present
selected properties and use cases of SAP-SAM. Finally, we discuss limitations of
the dataset along with recommendations on how to work with it.

2 Related Datasets

Compared to SAP-SAM, existing process model collections are rather small.
The hdBPMN [21] dataset, for example, contains 704 BPMN 2.0 models. This
collection has the special feature that the models are handwritten and can be
parsed as BPMN 2.0 XML. Another example is RePROSitory [5] (Repository of
open PROcess models and logS) which is an open collection of business process
models and logs, meaning users can contribute to the repository by uploading
their own data. At the time of writing, RePROSitory also contains around 700
models. Some models included in SAP-SAM have already been published [28].
However, the previously published dataset contains only 29,810 models that were
collected over a shorter period of time.

In the process mining community, the BPI challenge datasets, e.g., the BPI
challenge 2020 [8], have become important benchmarks. Unlike SAP-SAM, these
datasets consist of event logs from practice. Therefore, the applications of the
BPI challenge datasets only partially overlap with those of SAP-SAM.

3 Origins & Structure of SAP-SAM

SAP-SAM contains 1,021,471 process and business models that were created
using the software-as-a-service platform of the SAP Signavio Academic Initia-
tive3 (SAP-SAI), roughly from 2011 to 20214. Most models are in Business Pro-
cess Model and Notation (BPMN 2.05). SAP-SAI allows academic researchers,
teachers, and students to create, execute, and analyze process models, as well
as related business models, e.g., of business decisions. The usage of SAP-SAI is
restricted to non-commercial research and education. Upon registration, users
consent that the models they create can be made available for research pur-
poses, either anonymized or non-anonymized. SAP-SAM contains those models

3 See: signavio.com/bpm-academic-initiative/ (accessed at 2022-07-25)
4 The total number includes vendor-provided example models, which are automatically
added to newly created workspaces (process repositories that users register). About
470,000 models in the dataset bear the name of an example model, but this can only
be a rough estimate of the number of example models in the dataset.

5 Technically, the latest version of BPMN is, at the time of writing, BPMN 2.0.2. How-
ever, little has changed between 2.0 and 2.0.2. We assume that the informal cross-
vendor alignment eﬀorts of the OMG BPMN Model Interchange Working Group are
more substantial than formal progress between minor versions. In the following, we
therefore use BPMN 2.0 to refer to any version among 2.0 and 2.0.2.

for which users have consented to non-anonymized sharing. Still, anonymiza-
tion scripts were run to post-process the models, in particular to remove email
addresses, student registration numbers, and—to the extent possible—names.

The models in SAP-SAM were created between July 2011 and (incl.) Septem-
ber 2021 by a total of 72,996 users, based on a count of distinct user IDs that
are associated with the creation or revision of a model. The models were ex-
tracted from the MySQL database of SAP-SAI and are in SAP Signavio’s pro-
prietary JSON-based data format. The BPMN models are conceptually BPMN-
2.0-standard-compliant, i.e., individual models can be converted to BPMN 2.0
XML using the built-in functionality of SAP-SAI. Decision Model and Notation
(DMN) models can be exported analogously. The dataset contains models in the
following notations:

– Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN): BPMN is a standardized no-
tation for modeling business processes [15]. SAP-SAM distinguishes between
BPMN process models, collaboration models, and choreography models, and
among BPMN process models between BPMN 1.1 and BPMN 2.0 models.
– Decision Model and Notation (DMN): DMN is a standardized notation for

modeling business decisions, complementing BPMN [17].

– Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN): CMMN is an attempt to
supplement BPMN and DMN with a notation that focuses on agility and
autonomy [16].

– Event-driven Process Chain (EPC): EPC [22] is a process modeling notation

that enjoyed substantial popularity before the advent of BPMN.

– Uniﬁed Modeling Language (UML): UML is a modeling language used to
describe software (and other) systems. It is subdivided into class and use
case diagrams.

– Value Chain: A value chain is an informal notation for sketching high-level

end-to-end processes and process frameworks.

– ArchiMate: ArchiMate is a notation for the integrated modeling of informa-

tion technology and business perspectives on large organizations [13].

– Organization Chart: Organization charts are tree-like models of organiza-

tional hierarchies.

– Fundamental Modeling Concepts (FMC) Block Diagram: FMC block dia-

grams support the modeling of software and IT system architectures.

– (Colored) Petri Net: Petri nets [18] are a popular mathematical modeling
language for distributed systems and a crucial preliminary for many formal
foundations of BPM. In SAP-SAM, colored Petri nets [12] are considered a
separate notation.

– Journey Map: Journey maps model the customer’s perspective on an orga-

nization’s business processes.

– Yet Another Workﬂow Language (YAWL): YAWL is a language for modeling

the control ﬂow logic of workﬂows [26].

– jBPM: jBPM models allowed for the visualization of business process models
that could be executed by the jBPM business process execution engine before
the BPMN 2.0 XML serialization format existed. However, recent versions
of jBPM rely on BPMN 2.0-based models.

– Process Documentation Template: Process documentation templates sup-
port the generation of comprehensive PDF-based process documentation re-
ports. These templates are technically a model notation, although they may
practically be considered a reporting tool instead.

– XForms: XForms is a (dated) standard for modeling form-based graphical

user interfaces [2].

– Chen Notation: Chen notation diagrams [3] allow for the creation of entity-

relationship models.

SAP-SAM is available at https://zenodo.org/record/7012043. Its license
supports non-commercial use for research purposes, e.g., usage for the evaluation
of academic research artifacts, such as algorithms and related software artifacts.

4 Properties of SAP-SAM

SAP-SAM comprises models in diﬀerent modeling notations and languages, as
well as of varying complexity. In this section, we provide an overview of selected
properties of SAP-SAM. The source code that we used to examine the properties
is available at https://github.com/signavio/sap-sam.
Modeling notations. Figure 1 depicts the number of models in diﬀerent no-
tations in the dataset, as well as the according percentages (in brackets). We
aggregate notations which are used for less than 100 models respectively into
Other : Process Documentation Template (86 models), jBPM 4 (76 models),
XForms (20 models), and Chen Notation (3 models). The primarily used mod-
eling notation is BPMN 2.0, which conﬁrms that it is the de-facto standard for
modeling business processes [4]. Therefore, we will focus on BPMN 2.0 models
as we examine further properties.
Languages. Since SAP-SAI can be used by academic researchers, teachers and
students all over the world, the models in SAP-SAM are created using diﬀerent
languages. For example, SAP-SAM includes BPMN 2.0 models in 41 diﬀerent
languages. Figure 2 shows the ten most frequently used languages for BPMN 2.0
models. Note that the vendor-provided example models, which are added to
newly created workspaces, exist in English, German, and French. When a SAP-
SAI workspace is created, the example models added to it are in German or
French if the language conﬁgured upon creation is German or French, respec-
tively; otherwise, the example models are in English. This contributes to the fact
that more than half of the BPMN 2.0 models (57.43 %) are in English.
Elements. Figure 3 illustrates the occurrence frequency of diﬀerent element
types in the BPMN 2.0 models of SAP-SAM. It can be recognized that the el-
ement types are not equally distributed, which conﬁrms the ﬁndings of prior
research [14]. The number of models that contain at least one instance of a par-
ticular element type is much higher for some types, e.g., sequence ﬂow (98.88 %)
or task (98.11 %), than for others, e.g., collapsed subprocess (25.23 %) or start
message events (25.42 %). Note that Figure 3 only includes element types that
are used in at least 10 % of the BPMN 2.0 models. More than 30 element types

are used by less than 1 % of the models. On average, a BPMN 2.0 model in
SAP-SAM contains 11.3 diﬀerent element types (median: 11) and 46.7 diﬀerent
elements, i.e., instances of element types (median: 40).

Table 1 shows the number of elements per model by type. For a compact rep-
resentation, we aggregate similar element types by arranging them into groups.
On average, connecting objects, which include associations and ﬂows, make up
the largest proportion of the elements in a model (mean: 23.1, median: 20).
Labels. All elements of a BPMN 2.0 model can be labeled by the modeler,
which results in a total of 2,820,531 distinct labels for the 28,293,762 elements
of all BPMN 2.0 models in SAP-SAM. Figure 4 depicts the distribution of label
usage frequencies. We sorted the labels based on their absolute usage frequency
in descending order and aggregated them in bins of size 10,000 to visualize the

unevenness of the distribution. The ﬁrst bin (leftmost bar in the chart) therefore
contains the 10,000 most frequently used labels for the elements in the BPMN 2.0
models. Overall, 53.9 % of all elements in the BPMN 2.0 models are labeled with
these ﬁrst 10,000 labels. On the other hand, the long-tail distribution indicates
that many of the labels are used for only one element of all BPMN 2.0 models.
More precisely, 1,829,891 (64.9 %) of the labels are used only one time. The
unevenness of the label usage distribution can again partly be explained by the
vendor-provided examples in the dataset: The labels of the example processes
appear very frequently in the dataset.

5 SAP Signavio Academic Models Applications

As pointed out above, large process model collections like SAP-SAM are a valu-
able and critical resource for BPM research. Process models from practice codify
organizational knowledge about business processes and methodical knowledge
about modeling practices. Both types of knowledge can be used by research, for
example, for deriving recommendations for the design of future models. In addi-
tion, large process model collections are required for evaluating newly developed
BPM algorithms and techniques regarding their applicability in practice.

To illustrate the potential value of SAP-SAM for the BPM community, the
following list describes some application scenarios that we consider to be partic-
ularly relevant. It is neither prescriptive nor comprehensive; researchers can use
SAP-SAM for many other purposes.

Knowledge Generation. Process models depict business processes, codifying
knowledge about the operations within organizations. This knowledge can be
extracted and generalized to a broader context. Hence, SAP-SAM can be con-
sidered as a knowledge base to generate new insights into the contents and the
practice of organizational modeling. Example applications include:

– Reference model mining [20]: Reference models provide a generic template
for the design of new processes in a certain industry. They can be mined by
merging commonalities between existing processes from diﬀerent contexts
into a new model that abstracts from their speciﬁc features. By applying
this technique to subsets of similar models from SAP-SAM, we can mine new
reference models for process landscapes or individual processes, including,
e.g., the organizational perspective. Similarly, we could identify, analyze, and
compare diﬀerent variants of the same process.

– Identifying modeling patterns [10]: Process model patterns provide proven
solutions to recurring problems in process modeling. They can help in stream-
lining the modeling process and standardizing the use of modeling concepts.

D. Sola et al.

A dataset like SAP-SAM which contains process models from many diﬀerent
modelers, provides an empirical foundation both for ﬁnding new modeling
patterns and for validating existing ones. This also extends to process model
antipatterns, i.e., patterns that should be avoided, as well as modeling guide-
lines and conventions.

Modeling Assistance. The modeling knowledge that is codiﬁed in SAP-SAM
can also be used for automated assistance functions in modeling tools. Such
assistance functions support modelers in creating or updating process models,
accelerating and facilitating the modeling process. However, many assistance
functions are based on machine learning techniques and therefore require a large
set of training data to generate useful results. With its large amounts of contained
modeling structures and labels, SAP-SAM oﬀers a substantial training set, for
example, for the following applications:

– Process model auto-completion [23]. By providing recommendations on pos-
sible next modeling steps, process model auto-completion can speed up mod-
eling and facilitate consistency of the terms and modeling patterns that are
used by an organization. Besides structural next element type recommen-
dations, text label suggestions or even recommendations of entire process
segments are possible. SAP-SAM can be used to train machine learning
models for these purposes.

– Automated abstraction techniques [27]: One important function of BPM is
process model abstraction, i.e., the aggregation of model elements into less
complex, higher-level structures to enable a better understanding of the over-
all process. Such an aggregation entails the identiﬁcation and assignment of
higher-level categories to groups of process elements. SAP-SAM can provide
the necessary training data for an NLP-based automated abstraction.

Evaluation. Managing large repositories of process models is a key application
of BPM [7]. Researchers have developed many diﬀerent approaches to assist or-
ganizations with this task. To make these approaches as productive as possible,
they need to be tested on datasets that are comparable to those within orga-
nizations. Since SAP-SAM goes well beyond the size of related datasets, it can
be used for large-scale evaluations of existing process management approaches
on data from practice. Examples for these approaches include process model
querying [19], process model matching [1], and process model similarity [6].

6 Limitations and Recommendations for Usage

As explained in the previous section, SAP-SAM can be used by the academic
community to test and evaluate a plethora of tools and algorithms that address a
wide range of process querying and business process analytics use cases. However,
in the context of any evaluation, the limitations of the dataset need to be taken
into account. Considering the nature of SAP-SAM as a model collection that has
been generated by academic researchers, teachers, and students, the following
limitations must be considered:

SAP-SAM: A Large Process Model Dataset

9

– Many models in SAP-SAM exist multiple times, either as direct duplicates
(copies) or as very similar versions. This includes vendor-provided example
models or standard academic examples that are frequently used in academic
teaching and research. The existence of these models can be used to evaluate
variant identiﬁcation and fuzzy matching approaches in process querying,
but it negatively aﬀects the diversity, i.e., the breadth of the dataset.

– Many models may be of low technical quality, in particular the models that
are created by “process modeling beginners”, i.e., early-stage students, for
learning purposes. Although it can be interesting to analyze the mistakes or
antipatterns in such models, ﬂawed models can, for example, be problematic
when using the dataset for generating modeling recommendations based on
machine learning. Also, the mistakes that students make are most likely not
representative of mistakes made by process modeling practitioners.

– Because many of the models have most likely been created for either teaching,
learning, or demonstrating purposes, they presumably present a simplistic
perspective on business processes. Even when assuming that all researchers,
teachers, and students are skilled process modelers6 and have a precise un-
derstanding of the underlying processes when modeling, the purpose of their
models is typically fundamentally diﬀerent from the purpose of industry pro-
cess models. Whereas academic models often emphasize technical precision
and correctness, industry models usually focus on a particular business goal,
such as the facilitation of stakeholder alignment.

Let us note that this list may not be exhaustive; in particular, limitations
that depend on a particular use case or evaluation scenario need to be identiﬁed
by researchers who will use this dataset. Still, it is also worth highlighting that
the rather “messy” nature of the model collection reﬂects the reality of industrial
data science challenges, in which a suﬃciently large amount of high-quality data
(or models) is typically not straightforwardly available [11]; instead, substantial
eﬀorts need to be made to separate the wheat from the chaﬀ, or to isolate use-
cases in which the ﬂaws in the data do not have an adverse eﬀect on business
value, or any other undesirable organizational or societal implications.

When using SAP-SAM for academic research purposes, it typically makes
sense to ﬁlter it, i.e., to reduce it to a subset of models that satisfy desirable
properties. Here, we provide some recommendations to help with this step.

– It typically makes sense to ﬁlter out the vendor-provided example models

that are created by the SAP-SAI system upon workspace creation.

– For many use cases, researchers may want to sort out process models that
contain a very small or a very large number of elements. As can be expected
for BPMN 2.0 models and is shown in Figure 5, the number of nodes and
the number of edges in a model are highly correlated. Hence, it is suﬃcient
to ﬁlter according to the number of nodes. There is no need to additionally
ﬁlter according to the number of edges.

6 Considering the previous point, that means even when focusing on the subset of
the model collection that only entails models carefully created by skilled advanced
students, teachers, and researchers.

10

– Similarly, researchers may want to sort out process models where the element
labels have an average length of less than, for example, three characters to
ensure that only models with useful labels are included.

Let us again highlight that example code that demonstrates how the dataset
can be queried, as well as the code for the analysis in this paper is available at
https://github.com/signavio/sap-sam.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented the SAP-SAM dataset of process and other busi-
ness models. We are conﬁdent in our assumption that SAP-SAM is, by far, the
largest publicly available collection of business process models. Hence, it can—
despite the limitation that it entails “academic” models created by researchers,
teachers, and students and not by process management professionals—serve as
an excellent basis for developing and evaluating tools and algorithms for process
model querying and analysis.

In the future, SAP-SAM can potentially be augmented by including the fol-

lowing additional data objects:

– Business objects/dictionary entries: In addition to models, SAP-SAI sup-
ports the creation of business objects, so-called dictionary entries. These ob-
jects represent, for example, organizational roles, documents, or IT systems
and can be linked to models to then be re-used across a process landscape
that entails many models. Dictionary entries facilitate process landscape
maintenance, as well as reporting.

– Standard-conform XML serializations: The models in the SAP-SAM dataset
are serialized using a non-standardized JSON format that i) supports a gen-
eralization of modeling notations and ii) is more convenient to use than
XML-based serializations within the JavaScript-based front-ends of modern
web applications. However, proprietary components exist that can—in the
case of BPMN, DMN, and CMMN models—generate XML serializations
which are compliant with the corresponding Object Management Group
standards. Adding these XML serializations to the dataset can facilitate
academic use, as many open-source and prototypical software tools support
the open standards.

– PNG or SVG image representations: Similarly, to allow for a more straight-
forward visualization of models, PNG and SVG representations of the SAP-
SAM models can be generated and included.
