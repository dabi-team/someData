I. INTRODUCTION

With the emergence of new topological architectures, par-
allel and distributed processing research is at the heart of
developing new systems in order to be able to take advantage
of the underlying interconnection network. A thorough under-
standing of various aspects of parallel and distributed systems
is necessary to be able to achieve the performance of the
new parallel computers and supercomputers. Fault tolerance
and reliability have to be optimized for some obvious reasons
when choosing good models for interconnection networks. It
is well known that the topological interconnection network of
parallel and distributed system is usually modeled as a graph
G = (V, E), where the vertices and edges represent processors
and physical links between the processors.

There are many topological parameters of G to evaluate the
reliability of this interconnection network. It is known that
the problem of ﬁnding node or edge disjoint paths is closely
related to a well-known Menger’s theorem. Menger theorem
laid a solid foundation for the theory of fault tolerance and
reliability evaluation of interconnection network of parallel
processing systems. Let x and y be two any distinct vertices
of a graph G. The minimum size of an (x, y) edge-cut equals
the maximum number of edge disjoint (x, y)-paths. Menger’s
theorem is a characterization of the edge-connectivity in ﬁnite
graphs in terms of the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths
that can be found between any two distinct pair of vertices. As

 
 
 
 
 
 
the Menger’s theorem is often required to ﬁnd a maximum of
edge-disjoint paths between two given vertices of G, motivated
by this, we want to go even further, and consider the cases on
many-to-many edge disjoint paths of a connected graph G
under additional condition.

Let P be some graph-theoretic property of a connected
graph G. We aim to ﬁnd the maximum number of edge disjoint
paths connecting any two disjoint connected subgraphs with
just satisfying the property P in G. If P is containing a vertex,
then the corresponding version is the classical Menger edge-
connectivity. Conditional connectivity introduced by F. Harary
in 1983, generalized the theories of connectivity in both vertex
and edge versions. Not only does it meet the increasing need
of a more accurate measure of reliability of large-scale parallel
processing systems, but also theoretically enriches the theory
of network connectedness. This paper mainly studies six kinds
of conditional edge-connectivities under various link-faulty
hypotheses. The relationship between the vertex version and
various diagnosability has been investigated [3], [11], [15]–
[18], [20], [26].

Instead of focusing on studying the P-conditional edge-
connectivity of interconnection networks under various kinds
of links faulty hypotheses case by case, this paper mainly
offers a novel and uniﬁed edge isoperimetric methord to
investigated the P-conditional edge-connectivity of hamming
graph K n
L under six kinds of link-faulty hypotheses. These
edge-connectivities shares a common bipartite property: each
minimum P-conditional edge-cut separates the K n
L into two
components (or
two parts). For L-ary-n-dimension ham-
ming graph, Lt-extra edge-connectivity, t-embedded edge-
connectivity, cyclic edge-connectivity, (L − 1)t-super edge-
connectivity, (L − 1)t-average edge-connectivity and Lt-th
isoperimetric edge-connectivity share the same values in form
of (L − 1)(n − t)Lt for L ≥ 2, n ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ t ≤ n − 1.
Our results are applied to general class of networks. Reliability
evaluation and fault tolerance of an interconnection network of
some parallel and distributed systems are discussed separately
under various link-faulty hypotheses in terms of different P-
conditional edge-connectivity.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II,
some preliminaries, terminologies, and six kinds of deﬁnitions
about P-conditional edge-connectivity will be given. In section
III, known results about
the exact
isoperimetric problem,
values of ξm(K n
L) and its construction will be presented. In
section IV, some useful properties of the functions ξm(K n
L)
and exm(K n
L) will be proved. In section V, uniﬁed method
for P-conditional edge-connectivities of hamming graph K n
L
will be introduced. Finally, the conclusion of this paper will
be given in section VI.

II. PRELIMINARIES

In a connected graph G, for any edge set F ⊆ E(G), the
notation G − F denotes the subgraph obtained after removing
the edges in F from G. Given a vertex set X ⊆ V (G), we
denote G[X] the subgraph of G induced by X, and X =

V (G)\X is the complement of X. For two vertex sets X and
X, we denote [X, X] the set edges of G with one end in X
and the other end in ¯X. A component of graph G is a maximal
subgraph in which each pair of vertices is connected with each
other via a path.

Deﬁnition II.1. [7] Let P be a property of G. The edge subset

F ⊂ E(G) is deﬁned as a P-conditional edge-cut of G, if any,

G−F is disconnected, if any, and each component satisﬁes the

condition P. λ(P, G), P-conditional edge-connectivity of G,

is deﬁned as the minimum cardinality P-conditional edge-cut

F of G.

Based on the different properties and the faulty-free
set, recently many researchers have investigated the various
kinds of P-conditional edge-connectivity of many classes
of networks, such as h-extra edge-connectivity, l-embedding
edge-connectivity, cyclic edge-connectivity, k-super edge-
connectivity, k-average edge-connectivity and h-isoperimetric
edge-connectivity. Let
P h
P l
P c
P k
P k

1 = { containing at least h vertices},
2 = { lying in an l-dimensional subnetwork of G},
3 = { containing at least one cycle of G},
4 = { having the minimum degree at least k},
5 = { satisfying the average degree at least k}.

Note that if P = P h

1 , it gives the deﬁnition of h-extra edge-
connectivity of G ﬁrst introduced by F`abrega and Foil in 1996.

Deﬁnition II.2. [6] For a connected graph G, an edge subset

F ⊆ E(G) is called as an h-extra edge-cut of G, if exists,

G − F is disconnected and every component of G − F has

not less than h vertices. The h-extra edge-connectivity of G,

written as λh(G), is deﬁned as the minimum cardinality among

all the h-extra edge-cuts.

And if P = P l

2, it is deﬁned as the l-embedded edge-
connectivity of an n-dimensional
recursive network Gn,
ηl(Gn) for 0 ≤ l ≤ n − 1, ﬁrst introduced by Yang and
Wang in 2012 [28].

A graph G is cyclic edge connected if G can be separated
into at least two components with two of them containing a
cycle. The cyclic edge-connectivity of G, cλ(G), is minimum
number of edges whose removal disconnects the graph G
satisfying that at least two components with one cycle [22].
5 , the k-super edge-
connectivity and k-average edge-connectivity of G can be
deﬁned as the minimum cardinality of k-super edge-cut and
the minimum cardinality of k-average edge-cut , such that each
component of their removal from G has the minimum degree
at least k and the average degree at least k, respectively. The

Similarly, if P = P k

4 and P = P k

h-th isoperimetric edge-connectivity γh(G) of G is deﬁned as

γh(G) = min{|[U, U ]| : U ⊂ V (G), |U | > h, |U | > h},

where |[U, U ]| is the number of edges with one end in U and
the other end in U = V \U [25], [34]. Write

βh(G) = min{|[U, U ]| : U ⊂ V (G), |U | = m}.

A graph G with γj(G) = βj(G), j = 1, . . . , k is said to be
γh-optimal. Although the deﬁnition of h-th isoperimetric edge-
connectivity γh(G) of the graph G deletes the connectedness
of components from that of h-extra edge-connectivity λh(G),
and one does ﬁnd the situation where two deﬁnitions are not
equivalent, for the networks involved hamming graph and its
related variants in this paper, they do share the same values.
Although the above six kinds of P-conditional edge-
connectivities contain its own properties, they share a fact that
removal their each minimum P-conditional edge-cut results in
exact two components (or two parts). The P-conditional edge-
connectivity is called bipartite, if each minimum P-conditional
edge-cut results in exact two components (or two parts).

Let B = {P | P-conditional edge-connectivity is bipartite}.

Proof. For i 6= 3, recall that λ(P k

of an edge set of the graph G whose removal disconnects the

graph G with all its components satisfying the condition P k

the optimal number is obtained only when there are

exists a minimum P k

i - conditional edge-cut F0, whose removal
disconnects the connected graph G with all its components

H1, H2, . . . , Hz, z > 2 satisfying the condition P k

i , then there
exists an integer b, 1 ≤ b ≤ z, and [V (Hb), V (Hb)] is also an

P k

i -conditional edge-cut of G, where the induced subgraphs by
V (Hb) and V (Hb) are connected. Because of F0 ∩E(Hb) 6= ∅

or F0 ∩ E(G[V (Hb)]) 6= ∅, |[V (Hb), V (Hb)]|<|F0|, a contra-

diction. So for each i 6= 3, λ(P k

k = c, for convince, λ(P c

i , G) is bipartite. If i = 3,
3, G) means that each component

contains one cycle. The similar proof can be done.

This idea drives us to study the minimum possible
“boundary-size” of a set of a given “size”. The classical
isoperimetric problem is usually expressed in the form of an
2 ≥ 4πAM that relates the length LM of a
inequality LM
closed curve M and the area AM of the planar region that
it encloses in the Euclidean plane R2. Which closed curve
minimizes the length L of the curve with a ﬁxed size of the
area A? The equality holds if and only if M is a circle. It was
“known” to the ancient Greeks, but it was not until the 19th
century that this was proved vigorously by Karl Weierstrass in
a series of lectures in 1870, in Berlin. Isoperimetric problems
are classical objects of the study in mathematics. In general,
they ask for the minimum possible “boundary-size” of a set
of a given “size”, where the exact meaning of these words
varies according to the problem. Making efforts to obtain the
exact value of the P k
i -conditional edge-connectivity drives us
to study the minimum possible “edge boundary-size” of a set
of a given “size” in graph G.

For discrete case, a graph G = (V, E), the given “size”
is the “number of vertices”, while the “boundary-size” of
the graph is “the size of the edge boundary or the vertex
boundary”. Both edge and vertex versions are related to the P-
conditional edge-connectivity and P-conditional connectivity,
respectively. This paper mainly focuses on edge version. Let
G = (V, E) be a connected graph and A ⊆ V (G). Recall
|[A, A]| in the h-th
that the deﬁnition of βm(G) = min
isoperimetric edge-connectivity. For a given graph G, the edge
isoperimetric problem of G is to ﬁnd a subset A∗ ⊆ V (G)
with |A∗| = m such that βm(G) = |[A∗, A∗]| for any
1 ≤ m ≤ |V (G)| (introduced by Harper in 1964) [8]. Even
if in Harper’s seminal paper of edge isoperimetric problem
2 , the original deﬁnition G[A∗] is not
on hypercube Qn = K n
2 [A∗]
required to be connected, his example does satisfy that K n
is connected. Let ξe
m(G) = min{|[X, X]| : X ⊂ V (G) with
|X| = m ≤ ⌊|V (G)|/2⌋, and G[X] is connected }. ξe
m(G) is
unilateral connected for each 1 ≤ m ≤ ⌊|V (G)|/2⌋.

A⊆V,|A|=m

In this paper we want

to go further. Let ξm(G) =
min{|[X, X]| : X ⊂ V (G) with |X| = m ≤ ⌊|V (G)|/2⌋, and
both G[X] and G[X] are connected}. ξm(G) is bilateral con-
nected for each 1 ≤ m ≤ ⌊|V (G)|/2⌋. More coincidentally,

m(K n

and bilateral connected conditions, the result ξm(G) = ξe

does not always hold for each 1 ≤ m ≤ ⌊|V (G)|/2⌋.

as G3 × G2 × G1. Similarly, one can deﬁne the Cartesian
product of graphs Gn and Gn−1 × · · · × G2 × G1 inductively.
Each vertex Gn × Gn−1 × · · · × G2 × G1 can be denoted by
xnxn−1 · · · x2x1, 0 ≤ xi<|V (Gi)|, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. If Gk = G,
for each 1 ≤ k ≤ n, then Gn × Gn−1 × · · · × G2 × G1 =
, denoted by Gn, and it is n-th cartesian
G × G × · · · × G × G

8(G∗).

For example, given a 3-regular graph G∗ as shown in Fig.1,
1(G∗) = 4 6= 2. If the red edge cut in graph G∗
ξ8(G∗) = λ8
is removed, G∗ is divided into three components instead of
two, and the number of vertices of the two components is less
than 8. If the green edge cut in graph G∗ is removed, G∗ is
divided into two components, the number of vertices is 8 and
10, respectively. So ξ8(G∗) = 4 6= 2 = ξe

8(G∗).

m ⊆ V (G) satisfying that βm(G) = ξe

Followed Harper’s idea, for r-regular graph G, |A| = m
by Handshaking Lemma, βm(G) = r|A| − exm(G), where
exm(G) is the densest degree sum among all the m vertices
induced subgraphs. For each m ≤ ⌊|V (G)|/2⌋, if one can
ﬁnd a subset X ∗
m(G) =
ξm(G) = |[X ∗
m| = m, and both G[X ∗] and G[X ∗]
m, X ∗
are connected, with 2|E(G[X ∗
m])| = exm(G), then these three
deﬁnitions are equivalent. Such subsets X ∗
m are called optimal
for edge isoperimetric problem of G. We say that optimal
subsets are nested X ∗
m+1 if there exists a total order O
on the set V (G) such that for any m ≤ |V (G)| the collection
of the ﬁrst m vertices on the order is an optimal subset X ∗
m =

m ⊆ X ∗

v1<v2<v3< · · · <vi|<vi+1< · · · <vp−2<vp−1<vp.

For the networks involved hamming graph K n
L and its related
variants in this paper, they do satisfy this property. So in
the following discussion, conventionally, we use the notation
ξm(K n
L). It is quite convenient for us to study bipartite P-
conditional edge-connectivity of K n
L. In particular, for the h-
extra edge-connectivity, in 2018, Zhang et al. obtained that
[32], for each 1 ≤ h ≤ ⌊|V (G)|/2⌋,

λh(G) = min{ξm(G) : h ≤ m ≤ ⌊|V (G)|/2⌋}.

where ξm(G) = min{|[X, X]| : X ⊂ V (G), |X| = m ≤
⌊|V (G)|/2⌋, and both G[X] and G[X] is connected}. While
for general cases, in 2017, L. P. Montejano and I. Sau proved
that the problem of determining the exact value of λh(G) is
NP-complete [21].

Given two graphs G and H, the Cartesian product of G and
H H × G is deﬁned as V (H × G) = {uv | v ∈ V (G), u ∈
V (H)}, E(H × G) = {ux, vy | (u = v, x, y ∈ E(G)) or (x =
y, u, v ∈ E(H))}.

be denoted by XnXn−1 · · · X2X1 = {xnxn−1 · · · x2x1 | xi ∈
{0, 1}, 0 ≤ i ≤ 1}, 0 ≤ xi ≤ L − 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. For any
two vertices u = unun−1 · · · u2u1 and v = vnvn−1 · · · v2v1
in the graph K n
L, there is an edge between u and v if and only
if exactly one integer j satisﬁes ui 6= vi if i = j; ui = vi if
i = j, j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n}. By the deﬁnition of the K n
L, for given
integers 0 ≤ k ≤ L − 1, the subgraph K n

The n-dimensional bijective connection networks Bn (also
called hypercube-like networks) are a class of cube-based
networks including several well known interconnection net-
works like hypercubes (denoted by Qn), twisted cubes [9]
(denoted by T Qn), crossed cubes [5] (denoted by CQn),
spined cubes SQn, parity cubes P Qn, Z-cubes ZQn [33],
varietal cubes V Qn, M¨obius cubes [4] (denoted by M Qn),
locally twisted cubes [27] (denoted by LT Qn), restricted

hypercube-like networks RHLNn, generalized cubes GQn,
generalized twisted cubes [1] (denoted by GT Qn) and Mcubes
[24] (denoted by M CQn) as members.

In 2013, Zhang et al. obtained that ξm(Bn) = ξm(K n

2 ) [30].

Corollary III.4. ξm(Bn) = ξm(K n

So our main results can be used for the n-dimensional

bijective connection networks.

Subcase 3.1: By Lemma IV.5, we can obtain that

Lemma IV.3. For any 0 ≤ g ≤ L − 2, 0 ≤ t ≤ n − 2, then

ξ(g+1)Lt (K n

L) − ξgLt (K n

L) ≥ 0.

Proof. ξ(g+1)Lt (K n
L) = (L−1)nLt−(L−1)tLt−
2gLt = (L − 1)(n − t)Lt − 2gLt>(L − 1)(n − t − 2)Lt. The

L)−ξgLt (K n

last inequality holds because of g < L − 1 and n − t ≥ 2. So

the result holds.

Lemma IV.4. For any 0 ≤ g ≤ L − 1, 0 ≤ t ≤ n − 2, h0<Lt,
then ξgLt+h0(K n

L) for any Lt+1 ≤ m ≤ Ln−1.

Subcase 3.2: For any gLt ≤ m<Lt+1, g ≤ g0 ≤ L − 1,

L) ≥ ξg0Lt(K n

ξ(g0+1)Lt(K n
and ξg0Lt+h0(K n
Lemma IV.4. So one can have ξm(K n
gLt ≤ m<Lt+1.

L) is be obtained by Lemma IV.3
L) for h0<Lt is be obtained by
L) ≥ ξgLt (K n
L) for any

Combined Subcase 3.1 and Subcase 3.2, we can deduce that

In summary, ξm(K n

Lemma IV.5. For any positive integers 0 ≤ t ≤ n − 2, then

L) ≥ 0.

Lemma IV.7. For Ln−1 ≤ m ≤ ⌊Ln/2⌋, we have ξm(K n

L) ≥

Proof. ξLt+1(K n

L) − ξLt(K n
L)

= (L − 1)(L − 2)Lt

≥ 0.

Proof. Since the function ξm(K n

L) is highly relied on the
decomposition of the integer m and on the parity of L, we

give the decomposition of the integer ⌊Ln/2⌋ as follows:

In order to obtain our result, three cases of decomposition of

m are discussed (if L is even, there are only Case 1 and Case

2).

Case 1: For any 1 ≤ g < ⌊ L

2 ⌋, one can obtain that

ξ(g+1)Ln−1(K n

L) − ξgLn−1 (K n
L)

= (L − 1)nLn−1 − (L − 1)(n − 1)Ln−1 − 2gLn−1

Case 2: For any 1 ≤ g < ⌊ L

ξgLn−1+h0 (K n

L)

= (L − 1)nh0 − 2gh0 − exh0(K n

VI. CONCLUSION

Reliability evaluation and fault tolerance of an intercon-
nection network of some parallel and distributed systems are
discussed separately under various link-faulty hypotheses in
terms of different P-conditional edge-connectivity, where P
is some graph-theoretic property of a connected graph G.
This paper deals with the P-conditional edge-connectivities
of hamming graph K n
L with satisfying the property that each
minimum P-conditional edge-cut separates the K n
L just into
two components. And these P-conditional edge-connectivity
is called bipartite. We show that for hamming graph K n
L,
the Lt-extra edge-connectivity, t-embedded edge-connectivity,
(L − 1)t-super edge-connectivity, (L − 1)t-average edge-
connectivity and Lt-th isoperimetric edge-connectivity share
the same values in form of (L − 1)(n − t)Lt. Besides, we
also obtain the exact values of h-extra edge-connectivity and
h-th isoperimetric edge-connectivity of hamming graph K n
L
for each h ≤ L⌊ n
2 ⌋. Among these six kinds of connectiv-
ity, the solution of h-extra edge-connectivity is crucial for
solving the other ﬁve or even more general P-conditional
edge-connectivity. Because if any abstract P-conditional edge-
connectivity with bipartite property, the smallest cut must
be divided into two components, which is composed of a
component and its complement. The exact value of the P-
conditional edge-connectivity can be determined according
to the size of the λ(P)-atom. The value of h-extra edge-
connectivity is just a description of the number vertices in
the component. Our results improve several previous results
on this topic and can be applied to bijective connection

networks, which contain hypercubes, twisted cubes, crossed
cubes, M¨obius cubes, locally twisted cubes and so on.
