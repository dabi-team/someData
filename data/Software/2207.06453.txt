Abstract 

High-sensitivity shaken lattice interferometry (SLI) based sensors have the potential to 

provide deep space missions with the ability to precisely measure non-gravitational perturbing 

forces. This work considers the simulation of the OSIRIS-REx mission navigation in the vicinity 

of Bennu with the addition of measurements from onboard SLI-based accelerometers. The 

simulation is performed in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL) Mission Analysis, Operations 

and Navigation Toolkit (MONTE) and incorporates OSIRIS-REx reconstructed trajectory and 

attitude data from the Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) database. The use of 

the reconstructed data from NAIF provides realistic true dynamical errors and JPL’s MONTE 

software allows for a high-fidelity simulation of a nominal reference for the filter. The 

navigation performance and reduction of tracking and complex modelling enabled by the 

onboard SLI-based sensor are presented for two orbital phases of the OSIRIS-REx mission. 

Overall, the results show that the addition of SLI-based accelerometer measurements improves 

navigation performance, when compared to a radiometric tracking only configuration. In

addition, results demonstrate that highly-precise accelerometer measurements can effectively 

replace at least one day of DSN passes over a three-day period, thereby reducing tracking 

requirements. Furthermore, it is shown that lower-fidelity surface force modeling and parameter 

estimation is required when using onboard SLI-based accelerometers.

Introduction 

The design of trajectories for successful space exploration missions relies on detailed 

predictions of the gravitational and non-gravitational forces that will affect the spacecraft 

motion. During the mission, navigators continue to refine the trajectory predictions based on 

tracking data. The refinements include improving the fidelity of spacecraft surface models 

affecting solar radiation pressure and gravity models of target bodies being explored. We are 

interested in exploring how accelerometers of sufficient sensitivity at low frequencies could 

enable more precise characterization of non-gravitational forces acting on the spacecraft. This 

configuration could alleviate the modeling and tracking requirements for a mission, as well as 

provide better navigation performance. Advances in cold atom interferometry (CAI) have 

demonstrated the potential to provide highly sensitive measurements of acceleration with small 

biases, and negligible scale factor and drift (Jekeli, 2006; Battelier, et al., 2016; Reguzzoni, 

Migliaccio, & Batsukh, 2021). Shaken Lattice Interferometry (SLI) has further adapted CAI 

technology by trapping the atoms in the nodes of an electromagnetic standing wave. This 

configuration allows for longer interferometric sequence times and thus higher sensitivity than 

free-space propagation CAI-based sensors. The interferometric time for SLI-based sensors is not 

tied to the size of the device, as in the case of conventional CAI-based sensors, thereby 

supporting their potential miniaturization to dimensions suitable for use onboard spacecraft 

(Weidner, 2019; Theurkauf, 2020). This research explores how onboard measurements from 

2 

 
 
SLI-based accelerometers could be leveraged in a deep space mission to reduce the modeling and 

tracking burden. 

Ultra-sensitive electrostatic accelerometers (EAs) were used on both the Gravity 

Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Gravity field and steady-state Ocean 

Circulation Explorer (GOCE) missions. The goal of these missions was to precisely map the 

Earth’s gravity field using highly-sensitive onboard EAs to measure the gravity gradient and 

non-gravitational accelerations. The sensitive EAs were critical to the success of GRACE and 

GOCE, however they required frequent calibration due to their long term noise instability 

(Visser, 2008; Rummel, Yi, & Stummer, 2011; Christophe B. , 2013; Klinger & Mayer-Gurr, 

2016; Peidou & Pagiatakis, 2019; Fan, Liang, Wang, & Luo, 2022). CAI-based accelerometers 

have been proposed for use on future gravity mapping missions due to their noise stability at low 

frequencies compared to the performance of EAs (Carraz, Siemes, Massotti, Haagmans, & 

Silvestrin, 2014; Chiow, Williams, & Yu, 2015; Hogan & Kasevich, 2016; Migliaccio, et al., 

2019; Leveque, et al., 2021). Research has also considered the concept of hybridizing 

electrostatic and CAI-based accelerometers to capture the different sensor performance 

advantages (Jekeli, 2005; Christophe, et al., 2017). 

Conventional and CAI-based accelerometers have also been considered for use in 

navigation applications. Prior work by Bhatia and Geller (2020)  investigated the use of pairs of 

CAI-based accelerometers as ultra-precise inertial gradiometers for autonomous navigation. 

They evaluated the navigation performance of using measurements from onboard CAI-based 

accelerometers correlated to onboard gravity maps to determine orbital information. Canciani 

(2012) performed a simulation analysis of an aircraft using a combination of an aviation grade 

inertial navigation system (INS) and CAI-based accelerometer measurements to improve the INS 

3 

 
 
 
performance. Jekeli (2005) presented analysis of the integration of CAI-based sensors into a 

free-inertial navigation system and implications for navigation error improvement. Both 

Canciani and Jekeli focused on the method of dead-reckoning, which uses accelerometer 

measurements to directly propagate the position and velocity states of a vehicle. Alternately, Ely, 

Heyne, and Riedel (2012) investigated a method for using measurements from a conventional 

accelerometer directly in a navigation filter for the Altair lunar lander. 

Our work focuses on how an onboard SLI-based accelerometers could be leveraged to 

precisely measure the non-gravitational forces during a deep space mission. The method follows 

the approach used by Ely, Heyne, and Riedel where measurements from the accelerometer are 

used directly in the navigation filter. The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource 

Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx/OREx) mission to the asteroid Bennu 

was selected as a case study for this research. Actual OREx mission data from the Navigation 

and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) is used to provide the most realistic dynamic error 

profiles possible. The acceleration magnitudes and profiles experienced onboard OREx are 

investigated to identify the performance metrics required for a viable SLI-based accelerometer. 

Simulated SLI-based accelerometer measurements are then integrated into a high-fidelity 

simulation, in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL) Mission Analysis, Operations and 

Navigation Toolkit (MONTE), of the OREx navigation for two orbital phases. During the OREx 

mission, optical-navigation and landmark tracking were used in addition to DSN tracking. To 

understand the impact specific to using onboard accelerometers, this study considers estimation 

using only DSN tracking and SLI-based accelerometer measurements. The navigation 

performance is analyzed to determine the potential improvements in orbit estimation errors and 

reduction of tracking and modeling enabled by onboard SLI-based accelerometers.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the background and current 

performance of CAI/SLI-based sensors and their advantages over current state-of-the-art EA 

technology. Section 3 describes the motivation for the selection of the OREx mission as a case 

study and details the dynamic models used to simulate the OREx orbit. Section 4 presents the 

methods for simulation of DSN and SLI-based accelerometer measurements and the navigation 

filter set-up. Section 5 provides an analysis of the navigation performance for the OREx mission 

simulation, using measurements from the DSN in addition to the onboard SLI-based 

measurements. The paper concludes in Section 6 with a summary of findings and suggestions for 

future work. 

2  Cold Atom Interferometry Based Accelerometers 

Conventional accelerometers, such as mechanical or electrostatic sensors, measure the 

restoring force required to hold a proof mass steady in a null position within the housing or 

platform on which the unit is mounted. The restoring force is sensed to determine the 

acceleration on the proof mass (Conklin, 2015). Electrostatic accelerometers (EA) were used 

onboard the GRACE and GOCE missions to sense non-gravitational forces, including drag, solar 

radiation pressure, Earth albedo, thruster firings and magnetic torque accelerations on the 

spacecraft. Accurate measurement of the non-gravitational forces combined with precise 

radiometric tracking during the GRACE and GOCE missions enabled high-fidelity resolution 

mapping of the Earth’s gravity field (Touboul, Willemenot, Foulon, & Josselin, 1999). The EAs 

onboard the GRACE and GOCE missions achieved accuracies of 10-10 m/s2/√Hz and 

10-12 m/s2/√Hz (normalized for a 1-s integration period) respectively (Touboul P. , 2003; Flury, 

Bettadpur, & Tapley, 2008). However, these sensitivities were restricted to specific measurement 

bandwidths, 3.5x10-2 to 0.2 Hz for GRACE and 5x10-3 to 0.1 Hz for GOCE. At lower 

5 

 
 
frequencies, beyond these measurement bands, the noise increases as 1/f and with bias instability 

noise, typical for conventional accelerometers (Christophe, Marque, & Foulon, 2010; Christophe 

B. , 2013; Christophe, et al., 2017; Fan, Liang, Wang, & Luo, 2022). While this was not 

detrimental for the mission objectives, it does mean that the measurements could not be used 

directly, for example to support navigation (Rummel, Yi, & Stummer, 2011).  

CAI-based accelerometers were first developed in the early 1990’s and have been shown 

to provide sensitivities that far exceed the performance of conventional mechanical and 

electrostatic sensors (Clauser, 1988; Kasevich & Chu, 1991; Carnal & Mlynek, 1991). The 

interferometry sequence is performed by loading an atom cloud into a magneto-optic trap (MOT) 

where the atoms are cooled to micro-Kelvin level to reduce their velocities. The atom cloud is 

then excited by laser pulses, separating it into counter-propagating clouds along the axis of 

acceleration. The incident acceleration on the sensor causes a phase difference to accumulate 

between the two propagating clouds over the interrogation time. A final laser pulse recombines 

the clouds, generating an interference pattern representative of the difference in propagation 

paths. The acceleration can then be deduced from the interference pattern (Kasevich & Chu, 

1991). The potential advantage of using CAI-based accelerometers is that, unlike EAs, the 

underlying physics does not introduce any systematic errors or drift, dramatically reducing the 

requirements for calibration. CAI-based sensors display white noise at all frequencies below at 

least 100 mHz (Canuel, et al., 2006; Meunier, et al., 2014; Dutta, et al., 2016). This facilitates 

their use in making absolute acceleration measurements which can be used directly for 

navigation (Canuel, et al., 2006; Christophe, et al., 2017; Abrykosov, et al., 2019; Trimeche, et 

al., 2019).

Longer interrogation times improve the phase difference resolution for CAI, thereby 

providing greater sensor sensitivity. On Earth, interrogation times of conventional CAI-based 

sensors are limited by the atom free-fall-time due to gravity. Ground based CAI-based 

accelerometer studies have shown potential acceleration sensitivities of 1x10-8 m/s2/√Hz (Jekeli, 

2005; Kasevich, 2007). However, in zero-g, much longer interrogation times can be achieved. 

Nyman et al. (2006) presented a potential sensitivity of 1.8x10-10 m/s2/√Hz for a CAI-based 

accelerometer tested in zero-g, detailed in Table 1. The amplitude spectral power density is 

scaled for the 15 second shot time, as shown in Eq. (1).

Unlike the continuous measurement capability of conventional accelerometers, 

CAI-based accelerometers can only measure acceleration during the interrogation time of each 

duty cycle. There are dead bands between measurements, during which the atom cloud is cooled 

and prepared for the next interferometry sequence (total time minus interrogation time, 5 seconds 

in the case in Table 1). Hybrid accelerometer configurations have been proposed, which use 

measurements from conventional EAs to fill in the CAI dead bands (Lautier, et al., 2014; 

Christophe, et al., 2017; Abrykosov, et al., 2019). Following the work presented in Jekeli (2005), 

measurements from the combination of multiple accelerometers can be treated as a single 

measurement with combined accelerometer noise properties. Meunier et al. (2014) proposed an 

alternative approach of joint interrogation of up to five different atom clouds to remove dead 

7 

 
 
time; which also resulted in improved sensitivity of 1x10-13 m/s2 at a 60 s interrogation time. For 

the purposes of this work, it is assumed that either multiple CAI-based accelerometers are used 

with staggered sequence start times to cover dead bands, or the multi-cloud approach is used, 

thereby providing continuous measurement capability. 

In most CAI-based sensors the cloud of cold atoms is released, and the necessary 

interferometer steps are performed during its free-fall. With this method, interrogation time is 

tied to the free-fall distance, and therefore the sensitivity is constrained by the size of the 

apparatus. The sensitivity can be decoupled from cavity size by instead, confining the atoms to 

an optical lattice, where splitting/recombination and propagation are carried out by modulating 

the phase of the lattice. Machine learning techniques are used to determine effective shaking 

functions to achieve the desired sensor response to input accelerations (Weidner, Yu, Kosloff, & 

Anderson, 2017; Weidner & Anderson, 2018; Weidner & Anderson, 2018; Weidner, 2019; 

Theurkauf, 2020). Using shaken lattice interferometry (SLI), improved sensitivities can be 

achieved by simply increasing the atom hold time after splitting. Hold times of up to 20 s, a 

duration completely infeasible in 1-g for conventional CAI, have already been realized 

experimentally (Xu, et al., 2019).  

By confining atoms to a 3D lattice and loading atoms that have condensed into a Bose-

Einstein Condensate (BEC), high atom numbers with narrow velocity distributions can also yield 

increased sensitivities. Atom-atom interactions, which occur when atoms become denser with 

decreasing temperature, can cause phase errors due to their effect on both atom coherence and 

heating. By implementing a 3D lattice, interactions can be lowered by sparse population of the 

lattice through the use of a deep two-dimensional lattice with low single-site occupation. This 

results in an array of 1-D low atom number interferometers with shaking then taking place along 

8 

 
 
 
the third dimension. This approach allows total atom numbers to reach 106, lowering shot noise 

to levels comparable with state-of-the art atom interferometers.  

              High cycling rates are also feasible for SLI if an all-optical approach is taken for the 

generation of BEC. This involves using high powered laser beams instead of magnetic fields to 

perform evaporative cooling where atoms are cooled to degeneracy and form a BEC. By 

dynamically controlling these optical traps, experimental cycle times under 2 s have been 

achieved (Albers, 2020) and those under 1 s proposed (Roy, Green, Bowler, & Gupta, 2016). SLI 

therefore has the potential to enable sensors with high sensitivities that are much smaller than 

existing CAI-based devices, more suitable for use on spacecraft.  

3  OREx Case Study Simulation 

OREx was selected as a case study for this research because it presents the unique 

navigation challenge of orbiting a low-gravity asteroid. Bennu’s weak gravitational pull made 

OREx highly susceptible to non-gravitational perturbing forces, such as solar radiation pressure 

(SRP) and spacecraft thermal radiation. The success of the mission was achieved with a 

combination of extensive Deep Space Network (DSN) tracking, altimetry measurements, optical 

navigation, and the development of high-fidelity non-gravitational force models (Hesar, 

Scheeres, & McMahon, 2016; Williams, et al., 2018). The dominant non-gravitational perturbing 

force on the nominal OREx trajectory was SRP, and basic modeling proved insufficient in 

representing its full effect on the spacecraft. In certain orbit configurations, the SRP was on the 

order of Bennu’s non-point mass gravity field perturbations, causing the errors in the SRP model 

to alias into the gravity field estimation. To reduce the navigation errors due to SRP and improve 

the gravity recovery, the navigation team created a complex ray-trace SRP model. This model 

included self-shadowing and effects due to ray bounces between the spacecraft surfaces. In 

9 

 
 
addition, complex models for the spacecraft thermal radiation, Bennu Albedo (ALB) and HGA 

antenna transmission pressure were developed and used (Berry, et al., 2015; Geeraert, et al., 

2020). A successful touch-and-go (TAG) maneuver, to collect a sample from Bennu’s surface, 

required predicted state error resolution of tens of meters, and perturbing acceleration 

characterization at the level of 3 nm/s2 (Antreasian, et al., 2016). This requirement was 

ultimately met with the implementation of complex models, daily 5 to 8 hour DSN radiometric 

tracking, Bennu landmark tracking, and altimetry measurements (Getzandanner, et al., 2016). 

We have developed a simulation of OREx mission navigation in the vicinity of Bennu, with 

the added benefit of onboard SLI-based accelerometers. The simulation is performed using the 

Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL) Mission Analysis, Operations, and Navigation Toolkit 

(MONTE) software. MONTE allows high fidelity orbit propagation and estimation modeling for 

virtually any mission scenario (NASA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 2021). The simulation uses an 

OREx “truth” reconstructed trajectory and spacecraft attitude obtained from the Navigation and 

Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) database. The NAIF trajectory and attitude are imported 

directly into the MONTE simulation and the position, velocity, acceleration, and attitude are read 

off at requested simulation times. The filter nominal trajectory is generated using MONTE’s 

astrodynamic model libraries, populated with relevant spacecraft and relevant celestial body 

parameters produced by the navigation team to support the mission. The true and nominal 

trajectories differ based on the fidelity of the non-gravitational force models implemented for the 

truth reconstruction by the OREx team versus the nominal propagation in MONTE. In addition, 

the nominal trajectory is modified to include initial condition and gravity errors for the Monte 

Carlo analysis. The rest of this section details set-up for this OREx simulation.

3.1  NAIF Truth Trajectory 

Two timeframes were selected for simulation, shown in Table 2, which occur during the 

Orbit A and B phases of the OREx mission.  The Orbit A phase began on December 31, 2018, 

with a nominal orbit radius of 1.5 km. Orbit A was used to establish Bennu landmark tracking 

and characterize orbit navigation and maneuver performance. Orbit B began on June 12, 2019, 

with a nominal radius of 1 km. Orbit B was used primarily for radio science, establishing an 

accurate Bennu shape model, and determining a feasible landing site for sample collection 

(Lauretta, et al., 2017).  

Table 2: Simulation Timeframes 

Orbit A 
February 8 – 12, 2019 

Orbit B 
July 12 – 16, 2019 

These two phases were chosen to provide orbits with different radii and Sun-Bennu distances, 

resulting in distinct gravity and non-gravitational force acceleration profiles and magnitudes. 

From Orbit A to Orbit B the reduction in altitude results in an order of magnitude increase in 

perturbing accelerations from spherical harmonics (SPH); while a larger Sun-Bennu distance 

reduces the SRP and spacecraft thermal radiation magnitudes, shown later in Figure 3. Figure 1 

shows the two orbit orientations, indicating the radial (green), transverse (blue), and orbit normal 

(red) (RTN) directions at the start of each phase. Each orbit is shown from the perspective of 

Earth, looking directly towards Bennu. Both orbits lie in the terminator plane, with the normal 

direction aligned with the Sun-vector. The OREx team chose this orientation to remove the 

complication of OREx passing into Bennu’s shadow, thereby providing better stability with 

respect to SRP and temperature effects (Lauretta, et al., 2017).

The spacecraft frame is shown in Figure 2. The +X axis is oriented through the face 

containing the HGA. The +Z axis is oriented along the face containing the low-gain antenna and 

the +Y axis completes the right-handed frame (Semenov, 2014; Lauretta, et al., 2017). During 

Orbits A and B, OREx was primarily oriented with Z-axis aligned in the nadir-direction and the 

+X-axis, aligned with the Sun-vector (hence predominantly in the orbit normal direction). Once a 

day the spacecraft is slewed to point the HGA antenna towards Earth for DSN radiometric 

tracking for up to 5 hrs per day (Williams, et al., 2018).

For the purposes of this work, the state vectors are propagated and estimated in the filter in the 

EME2000 frame. The non-gravitational acceleration profiles are presented in the spacecraft XYZ 

frame due to their strong correlation with the spacecraft pointing directions. The filter results are 

mapped to the RTN frame to allow for comparison with mission analysis presented by the OREx 

navigation team. 

3.2  MONTE Simulated Nominal Trajectory 

The nominal trajectory for filter propagation is simulated using point mass (Gm) and 

spherical harmonic (SPH) gravity, SRP, and Albedo (ALB) acceleration models, populated with 

relevant OREx and Bennu parameters. A time history of the acceleration due to spacecraft 

thermal radiation pressure, provided by the NASA/KinetX team, is included in the model 

validation (J. Leonard and J. Geeraert personal communication, Sept 3, 2021). The set-up for 

each acceleration model is validated and then used to generate a nominal reference for the filter, 

populated with the model fidelity available during the mission phase. 

3.2.1  Acceleration Modeling for OREx 

The OREx spacecraft is modelled using nine flat plates to represent the -X and +/-YZ bus 

faces and the front and back of each solar array; and a parabolic dish for the HGA. The specular 

and diffuse coefficients, shown in Table 3, are based on Germanium Kapton MLI for the bus and 

HGA, and general material properties for solar panels, as presented in Kenneally (2019).

The spacecraft bus attitude is provided from the NAIF database. The solar array baseplate 

frames, fixed to the bus attitude, are then obtained via a 180° rotation about the Z axis and –90° 

degree rotation about the X axis for the +Y array, and a 90° rotation about X for the -Y array. 

The rotations of the gimbal frames from NAIF, defined about the baseplate frames, are then used 

to define the attitude profiles for each solar array (Semenov, 2014). 

The filter nominal SRP and ALB profile generation uses the spacecraft shape model and 

orientation data to determine the force incident on each spacecraft component. The effect on 

each component is then combined into an overall acceleration. The thermophysical coefficients 

for Bennu used in the ALB simulation are shown in Table 4.

Both models use the orientation of the spacecraft components to determine effective area, but do 

not account for self-shadowing i.e., if one surface is blocking another from the incident rays. 

Bennu’s gravity model is simulated with the Gm gravitational parameter and 16x16 SPH field 

used during the actual NAIF trajectory reconstruction, provided by the NASA/KinetX team (J. 

Leonard and J. Geeraert personal communication, Sept 3, 2021). 

3.2.2  MONTE Model Set-Up Validation 

To validate each acceleration component set-up in MONTE, the component of interest is 

evaluated along the NAIF-truth trajectory, populated with the OREx and Bennu parameter values 

used at the time of NAIF trajectory reconstruction. The profile is then compared to the full 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
NAIF-truth acceleration minus the profiles of all but the acceleration of interest, each evaluated 

along the NAIF-truth. This comparison confirms that the correct set-up parameters have been 

chosen. The full 16x16 SPH field, perfect Gm, and the thermal radiation acceleration profile are 

used for the validation process. Figure 3 shows the resulting acceleration profiles obtained for 

the total trajectory (green), Gm (black), SPH (blue), SRP (red), ALB (cyan), and spacecraft 

thermal radiation (gold) accelerations, evaluated along the NAIF-true trajectory. The acceleration 

profiles and magnitudes are consistent with those generated by the OREx team for both orbit 

phases, as presented in Antreasian, et al. (2016) and Leonard, et al. (2019). To determine the 

difference between the total NAIF reconstructed and combined acceleration models, the Gm, 

SPH, SRP, ALB, and thermal acceleration models (ScTherm), propagated along the true NAIF 

trajectory, are subtracted from the total NAIF trajectory acceleration profile, shown in pink on 

Figure 3. 

Figure 3: Simulated Acceleration Magnitudes of OREx in Orbit A (left) and B (right) 

Figure 4 shows a comparison between the NAIF-true trajectory acceleration minus the 

Gm and SPH models propagated along the NAIF-true trajectory and the SRP, ALB and thermal 

15 

 
 
 
 
radiation models propagated along the NAIF-true trajectory. This shows the difference between 

the NAIF-true non-gravitational acceleration, used as the truth for this study, and 

non-gravitational acceleration models set-up in MONTE. This is the pink profile from Figure 3, 

shown in terms of its XYZ components in the spacecraft frame in Figure 4. 

Figure 5 shows the differences between the two acceleration profiles presented in Figure 

4. The difference between the true and modelled accelerations evaluated along the true 

trajectory, is primarily due to the 9 plates plus cone HGA SRP model used. This SRP model uses 

imperfect spectral and diffusion coefficients, an overly simplistic HGA model, and does not 

account for self-shadowing or solar ray bounces between surfaces. The mismodeling is made 

more apparent by once per day attitude maneuvers to orient the high gain antenna (HGA) toward 

the Earth. The change of Sun exposure on the different spacecraft surfaces in the Earth pointing, 

versus the nominal Sun pointing orientations, results in significant jumps in the SRP profile, that 

can be seen at the start of each day in Figure 5. Additional spikes are also present in the Orbit A 

total and differenced profiles when ORX performs imaging sweeps of Bennu for optical 

navigation, seen between the larger daily HGA-pointing maneuvers (Williams, et al., 2018).

The differences introduced by the SRP mismodeling are consistent with those 

documented by the OREx team for Orbit A when using a simplified SRP model (Geeraert, et al., 

2020). The team saw differences on the order of 1x10-9 m/s2 in X and 6x10-9 m/s2 in Z in the 

Earth pointing orientation. To reduce these effects, they developed and incorporated complex 

HGA and ray-trace SRP models into the OREx mission navigation process (Leonard, et al., 

2019). For our study, onboard SLI-based accelerometers will measure the total non-gravitational 

accelerations, including the signature that is mismodeled in the filter nominal propagation, seen 

in Figure 5. This will allow an analysis of how well the mismodeled accelerations can be 

compensated for in the filter using the accelerometer measurements. If the mismodeling can be 

sufficiently captured by the accelerometer measurements, then modeling requirements, such as 

the need for the complex SRP model, could potentially be reduced.

4  OREx Measurement Simulation and Navigation Filter Set-Up 

The position and velocity of OREx are estimated in a conventional Kalman filter (CKF). 

DSN radiometric tracking measurements and SLI-based accelerometer measurements are 

simulated along the true trajectory, including relevant sensitivity levels. The filter propagates the 

nominal trajectory and processes the DSN radiometric and accelerometer measurements. The 

initial condition error for Orbit A is 1 m position and 0.1 mm/s velocity 1σ. This error is based 

on an approximation of the trajectory error predicted by the OREx team at Data Cutoff (DCO) in 

Reference (Geeraert, et al., 2020), when using an optimized antenna +9-plate SRP model. For 

Orbit B, initial condition errors of 0.3 m and .03 mm/s 1σ are used, based on the state errors 

predicted by the OREx team at DCO in Reference (Williams, et al., 2018), with and without 

desaturation maneuvers. The nominal trajectory includes Gm and 3x3 SPH gravity, with 1σ 

gravitational parameter error (Gm) of 2.44x10-12 km3/s2 (.15% of Gm) (Williams, et al., 2018) 

(Antreasian, et al., 2016; Williams, et al., 2018; Leonard, et al., 2019; French, 2020). The simple 

9-plate + HGA spacecraft model is used for SRP and ALB propagation. During navigation 

analysis of the OREx mission, presented in Leonard, et al. (2019) and Berry, et al. (2015), a 3σ 

SRP scale factor error of 10% was used. For the purposes of this simulation, SRP errors are 

present due to the simplified SRP model, so no additional scale factor error is applied. 

Acceleration due to the spacecraft thermal radiation pressure is not included in the nominal 

model in the filter. 

4.1  Simulated DSN Measurements 

During both Orbit A and B phases of OREx radiometric tracking from the DSN was 

available for approximately 5 hrs per day on the HGA with up to an additional 3 hrs on the 

low-gain antenna. For the actual OREx mission, the two-way range noise was weighted at 3 m 

18 

 
 
1σ to account for hardware biases, ionosphere, and solar plasma effects. The X-band 

(~8.45 GHz) Doppler noise for a 60 s count time was weighted at 0.1 mm/s 1σ, 0.00563 Hz 

2-way (Williams, et al., 2018). In our simulation, two-way range and Doppler measurements are 

created at a 60 s time step, including the 3 m and 0.1 mm/s noise error respectively. The 

simulated measurement passes are aligned with the HGA Earth-pointing attitude times, i.e., the 

times when the daily large steps occur in the profiles shown in Figure 4, using the DSN station in 

view during that interval. These passes occur daily and are approximately 5 hrs long. 

4.2  Simulated Accelerometer Measurements 

Accelerometers sense the non-gravitational forces incident on a spacecraft (Titterton & 

Weston, 2004; Jekeli, 2005; Jekeli, 2006). To simulate accelerometer measurements of the OREx 

true trajectory, the validated Gm and 16x16 SPH gravity model is evaluated along the trajectory. 

This gravitational acceleration (𝑎⃑𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒, 𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑣) is then subtracted from the total acceleration profile 

(𝑎⃑𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒, 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙), leaving the non-gravitational acceleration (𝑎⃑𝑁𝐺), as shown in Eq. (2). 

𝑎⃑𝑁𝐺 = 𝑎⃑𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒, 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  −  𝑎⃑𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒, 𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑣 

(2) 

Following the work of Ely, Heyne, and Riedel (2012), the accelerometer measurements are 

simulated as delta-velocity measurements of Euler integrated accelerations over the measurement 

sample period, shown in Eq. (3),  

𝑛−1

∆𝑉(𝑡𝑛) =   ∑[𝐼 + 𝛴 + 𝛬  +  𝛺][𝑎𝑛𝑔(𝑡𝑖) + 𝑏 + 𝑣(𝑡𝑖)][𝑡𝑖+1 −  𝑡𝑖]

(3) 

𝑖=1

where measurements are taken every 60 s and 𝑛 is the sample counter, 𝑣 is the Gaussian white 

noise accelerometer error, Σ is the scale factor error, Λ is the misalignment error, Ω is the 

orthogonality error, and 𝑏 is the bias error. Internally, the accelerometer is accumulating the 

acceleration over a 60 s sampling interval, at an internal frequency rate. 

19 

 
 
 
Based on the range of potential performance metrics for SLI-based accelerometers, 

multiple accelerometer sensitivities are investigated, shown in Table 5. The sensitivities are 

presented as amplitude spectral density power and per shot following the calculation shown in 

Eq. (1).

Figure 6 shows the simulated accelerometer measurements, observed along the true 

trajectory, and the measurements computed by the filter along the nominal trajectory. The 

computed measurements, propagated along the nominal trajectory, include a realization of the 

injected error sources and initial condition error. The observed measurements shown are 

generated for the 1x10-9 m/s2 accelerometer sensitivity.

and computed (black) measurements simulated along the filter nominal, for a 1x10-09 m/s2 
sensitivity, for Orbit A (left) and Orbit B (right) expressed in the spacecraft frame 

20 

 
 
 
The discrepancy between the simulated observed and computed measurements is due to the 

simplified models used in the filter nominal propagation and the initial condition errors applied. 

The most significant effect is from the simplified model of the HGA on the +X spacecraft face, 

which appears as discrepancy in the X and Z directions, depending on whether the spacecraft is 

in the Earth or Sun-pointing orientation. In addition, the thermal radiation pressure effect is 

greatest in the X spacecraft direction.  Thus, its exclusion from the nominal propagation leads to 

a discrepancy between the observed and computed measurements in that direction. 

Figure 7 shows the difference between the observed measurements, simulated along the 

NAIF-true trajectory, and the computed measurements, simulated along the filter nominal, for 

both orbits. The accelerometer sensitivity of 1x10-9 m/s2 is sufficient to observe the overall 

features of the non-gravitational force modeling error, which are on the order of 

0.5-1.5x10-8 m/s2 for Orbit A and 2.5-5x10-9 m/s2 for Orbit B. However, some of the smaller 

features are obscured by the measurement noise.

4.3  Filter and Accelerometer Measurement Processing Set-Up 

The filter state (𝑋) includes the XYZ position and velocity deviations from the nominal 

for the OREx spacecraft in the EME2000 frame. In addition to the position and velocity states 

the filter includes stochastic acceleration states, estimated to account for the unmodeled 

accelerations. The stochastic acceleration state for each component is modeled as a mean-zero 

white noise process, in the spacecraft frame. The stochastic acceleration state (𝑎𝑖) is incorporated 

into the filter as shown in Eq. (4) (shown for the X axis in the spacecraft frame), 

𝑥𝑥,𝑖+1

where ∆𝑡 is the filter step-size, 𝑥̇𝑖 is the velocity state, 𝑥𝑖is the position state, and 𝑤𝑥,𝑖 is the 

white noise process (Ely, Heyne, & Riedel, 2012). This allows the filter to absorb unmodeled 

accelerations into the stochastic XYZ state informed by the noise sigma of 𝑤𝑥,𝑖. The noise 

strength is determined by the size of the unmodeled gravitational and non-gravitational force 

acceleration errors induced by the mismodeling in the nominal trajectory. 

The accelerometer measurements relate to the stochastic acceleration state via the 

measurement equation (shown for the X-axis in the spacecraft frame), 

∆𝑉𝑥,𝑖 = 𝑎𝑥,𝑖∆𝑡 +   𝑣𝑥,𝑖   

and subsequent measurement partial matrix, 

𝜕∆𝑉𝑥,𝑖
𝜕𝑋𝑖

= [01𝑥3 01𝑥3 ∆𝑡 0 0 ]. 

(5) 

(6) 

The accelerometer measurements are processed directly in the filter as done by Ely, Heyne, and 

Riedel (2012).  This is in contrast to a dead reckoning approach commonly used in inertial 

navigation systems, where accelerometer measurements are used to propagate the nominal 

trajectory, as presented in Jekeli (2005).

5  OREx Simulation Results 

The filter was run for full and reduced DSN pass cases for Orbit A and B. The first 

scenario uses all the daily passes, representing the pass configuration available during the actual 

OREx mission (Antreasian, et al., 2016). The second scenario removes the third and fourth pass 

for Orbit A and B respectively. Ten unique profiles of initial condition and measurement error 

were constructed. These profiles were applied to each scenario for a DSN only case and for 

several accelerometer sensitivity configurations. Each of the ten run sets used the same initial 

condition error and DSN and accelerometer measurement sensitivity realizations. The average 

position RMS for each component for each of the ten runs are shown in Table 6, expressed in the 

RTN frame. The RMS is calculated from the start of the 3rd DSN pass for Orbit A and 2nd pass 

for Orbit B, to allow for filter convergence. Figure 8 shows the position estimation error and 1σ 

bounds for the daily pass (passes shown in grey) configuration, for DSN measurements only 

(blue) and 1x10-9 m/s2 accelerometer measurements (magenta) configurations.

and Orbit B (right) – RTN frame 

The inclusion of accelerometer measurements improves the navigation performance for 

both orbit phases. Using accelerometers with sensitivity less than 1x10-9 m/s2 results in only 

marginal improvement. Examining Figure 6 and Figure 7, the primary benefit of the 

accelerometers is from capturing the non-gravitational force profile features that are on the order 

of 1x10-09 m/s2. During the real Orbit A mission phase, SRP scale factor and gravity parameters 

were estimated, allowing position resolution to 10-meter levels (Antreasian, et al., 2016; 

Williams, et al., 2018). SRP is the largest acceleration for Orbit A (aside from Gm), and an order 

of magnitude larger than SPH, so capturing the non-gravitational forces with the accelerometers 

allows for an improvement in estimation from tens of meters to less than 10 m. For Orbit B, the 

SRP surface forces and the uncertainty in the SPH gravitational forces are of very similar 

magnitude. The addition of the accelerometers for Orbit B improves the position resolution by a 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
few meters. The reduction in error overall is less in the case of Orbit B than A, but there is a 

relative reduction, from the DSN only to the 1x10-9 m/s2 sensitivity case, of 40% in radial, 50% 

in in-track and 20% in cross-track errors, for both orbits.  

Overall, we find that the navigation performance achieved in both orbit scenarios, with 

reduced DSN tracking and onboard accelerometers, is comparable to or better than the use of a 

full DSN daily tracking schedule with no accelerometers. Using the onboard accelerometers 

helps resolve the non-gravitational accelerations, subsequently improving the ability to 

determine the gravity field from the radiometric measurements. Furthermore, the use of 

SLI-based accelerometers could reduce the dependence on high accuracy non-gravitational force 

modeling and expanded filter state vectors to estimate systematic disturbances, allowing for the 

navigation filter state vector to includes only the vector components of position, velocity, and 

stochastic acceleration.  

6  Conclusion 

The advancement of compact precision accelerometers based on shaken lattice 

interferometry (SLI) provides an opportunity to consider future space exploration missions with 

greater autonomy and flexibility to observe and adapt to unexpected dynamical conditions.  In 

this study, we analyzed of the use of precise SLI-based accelerometers for an OREx type 

mission, choosing this mission because of the unique challenges faced in navigating at very low 

altitudes above a very small body.  These small orbits, only weakly held by Bennu’s gravity, are 

substantially perturbed by solar radiation pressure – which is highly variable due to eclipse 

conditions and significant changes in spacecraft orientation. It is therefore an ideal case study to 

establish the levels of accelerometer performance useful for future space missions. For this 

scenario we found that a sensitivity of 1x10-9 m/s2 is required to capture relevant surface 

25 

 
accelerations and have a meaningful impact on navigation performance. Reduction in 

acceleration sensitivity below that level provides no appreciable navigation benefit without a 

corresponding improvement in knowledge of the gravitational field. In addition, the utilization of 

onboard accelerometers was shown to allow for a reduction of at least a day in required DSN 

tracking while maintaining similar navigation performance. This study used real reconstructed 

truth from the NAIF database to provide the most realistic simulation of dynamical errors 

possible, and JPL’s MONTE software to provide a high-fidelity simulation comparison.  

The analysis presented did not consider the potential for estimating Bennu’s gravity field 

using a combination of DSN and SLI-based accelerometer measurements. This configuration 

would be similar to the high-fidelity Earth-gravity mapping performed by the GRACE and 

GOCE missions (Christophe B. , 2013).  The precise characterization of the surface accelerations 

would reduce the need to estimate parameters of complex models for SRP and thermal radiation. 

This would eliminate the aliasing of non-gravitational accelerations into the Gm and SPH 

estimation and facilitate better resolution of the gravity field. Migliaccio et al. (2019) proposed 

the Mass Observation with Cold Atom Sensors in Space (MOCASS) mission, a GRACE/GOCE 

analog gravity mapping mission using onboard cold atom sensors, but to date it remains only a 

mission concept (Pivetta, Braitenberg, & Barbolla, 2021).
