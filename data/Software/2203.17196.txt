Transformers

ABSTRACT
Users use Issue Tracking Systems to keep track and manage issue
reports in their repositories. An issue is a rich source of software
information that contains different reports including a problem,
a request for new features, or merely a question about the soft-
ware product. As the number of these issues increases, it becomes
harder to manage them manually. Thus, automatic approaches are
proposed to help facilitate the management of issue reports. This
paper describes CatIss, an automatic Categorizer of Issue reports
which is built upon the Transformer-based pre-trained RoBERTa
model. CatIss classifies issue reports into three main categories of
Bug report, Enhancement/feature request, and Question. First, the
datasets provided for the NLBSE tool competition are cleaned and
preprocessed. Then, the pre-trained RoBERTa model is fine-tuned
on the preprocessed dataset. Evaluating CatIss on about 80 thou-
sand issue reports from GitHub, indicates that it performs very well
surpassing the competition baseline, TicketTagger, and achieving
87.2% F1-score (micro average). Additionally, as CatIss is trained
on a wide set of repositories, it is a generic prediction model, hence
applicable for any unseen software project or projects with little
historical data. Scripts for cleaning the datasets, training CatIss and
evaluating the model are publicly available. 1

a bug, requesting a new feature, asking for improvement, asking
questions, and asking for support.

Issues in software repositories must have a title, a description, and
a state (open/closed). They can also have additional data such as la-
bels, assignees, milestone, timestamps, author association, comments,
and more. Issue description usually includes useful information
about the reported problem and even code snippets to elaborate on
the reported problem. Moreover, each issue can have several labels
such as bug report to denote the goal behind opening the issue.
Labels, as a sort of metadata, describe the goal and content of an
issue. They are mainly used for categorizing, managing, searching,
and retrieving issues. Thus, assigning labels to issues facilitates task
assignment, maintenance, and management of a software project.
Cabot et al. [1] analyzed about three million non-forked GitHub
repositories to investigate the label usage and its impact on re-
solving issues. They showed only about 3% of these repositories
had labeled issues. Furthermore, in the repositories which incor-
porated issue labeling, only about 58% of issues were labeled. The
authors showed addressing an issue and the engagement rate both
have a high correlation with the number of labeled issues in a
repository [1]. Recently, Liao et al. [7] investigated the effect of
labeling issues on issue management and found labeled issues were
addressed immediately, while unlabeled issues could remain open
for a long time.

As the number of users and reported issues increases, efficient
and timely management of issue reports becomes harder. Team
members should address these issues as soon as possible to keep
their audience engaged and improve their software product. Thus,
automatic approaches for managing issues are proposed. However,
their accuracy can be improved by using contextual information
better.

In this tool paper, using data-driven approaches, The author fine-
tunes a Transformer-based pre-trained RoBERTa-based model to
predict the category of issue reports. These categories are the three
frequent reasons for opening an issue, namely Bug reports, En-
hancement requests, and Questions. CatIss achieves 87.2% F1-score
as the micro average score for all three categories of issues. Further-
more, CatIss obtains 89.6%, 87.9%, and 69.1% of per class F1-score
for bugs, enhancements, and questions, respectively. As CatIss is
built using a Transformer architecture, it is able to better utilize the
contextual information in issue reports, hence providing more accu-
rate predictions. CatIss surpasses TicketTagger [5, 6], the baseline
approach in all categories and for all metrics. More importantly,
based on the Recall score of classes, CatIss significantly outperforms
TicketTagger by 89% for the Question category. Compared to Bug
and Enhancement, “Question” is the least-represented class in the
datasets, and consequently suffered from weak accuracy scores in
previous studies. However, CatIss is able to obtain much higher

2.1 Preprocessing Data
Data processing techniques used to clean the provided training
set are as follows. Using the “describe” function of the Pandas
dataframes, it is evident that the training set consists of duplicate
issue reports. Thus, the author first removes the duplicate issues
using their issue URL as their unique ID. This process removes
26220 from the 722899 available issues in the training set. Note
that deduplication is only performed on the training set to avoid
modifying the samples’ distribution in the test set.

Next, the author perform normalization on the text of issue titles
and bodies. Normalization refers to the technique of replacing the
content of a concept in the text with the name of that concept. For
instance, function names are extracted using regular expressions
and replaced with a fixed token ⟨𝐹𝑈 𝑁𝐶𝑇 𝐼𝑂𝑁 ⟩. Text normalization
is conducted with two objectives; (1) to keep the existence of a func-
tion in text, and (2) to reduce the vocabulary size for the machine
learning models [3].

Then, punctuation marks, and non-ASCII characters are removed
from both title and body of issues. Next, the text in titles and
bodies is converted to lower case. The base URL of repositories
(https://api.github.com/repos/) is also removed from the repository_url
column as it does not provide additional information for the model.
After removing white spaces from the title and body columns,
the five remaining columns are concatenated together to construct
the input for the model (excluding issue_url column). These five
columns are: (1) issue_create_at: the time that an issue was
created, (2) issue_author_association: the issue author role, (3)
repository_url: the repository ‘owner + repository’ names, (4)
issue_title, and finally (5) issue_body.

In the end, the text columns in both train and test datasets are
truncated based on the average and median number of tokens in
issue titles and bodies of the train set. Note that one must not rely
on the test set’s statistical information as the model will not see the
test set before training. The average numbers of tokens for issue
titles and bodies after cleaning are 6 and 49 tokens. Also, the median
number of tokens for the latter is about 100 token. Hence, the cutoff
point is to 200 tokens in the text column. Note that the issue classes
in the label column (bug, enhancement, and question) are also
converted to their categorical codes (0, 1, 2) and then fed to the
model.

The Jupyter notebooks describes data processing, model training,

on the management of issue reports through categorization and
prioritization [2].

2 TOOL DESCRIPTION
The author first cleans and pre-processes the dataset provided for
the NLBSE tool competition [4]. Then, she proceeds to fine-tune
the pre-trained Transformer-based RoBERTa model [8] on the pre-
processed data, and finally, evaluates it on the competition test set.
In the following, CatIss will be described in more detail. Figure 1
presents a concise summary of the proposed approach.

2.2 Model Training
For the past few years, Transformers have significantly impacted
the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. Now, Pre-trained
models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Trans-
formers (BERT) can be fine-tuned using additional outputs layers
to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of NLP tasks,
without major task-specific architecture modifications. Based on
our recent study on issue report management [2], CatIss adapts
a Robustly-optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa) and fine-tunes
it [8]. RoBERTa, developed by Facebook [8], includes additional
pre-training improvements using only unlabeled text from the web,
with minimal fine-tuning and no data augmentation. The authors
modified the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task in the BERT
using dynamic masking. The authors also eliminated the Next Sen-
tence Prediction (NSP) task since Facebook’s analysis indicated

that it actually hurts the model’s performance. Finally, RoBERTa
was trained using larger mini-batch sizes compared to BERT. The
author defines a multi-class classification layer on top of this model
as the downstream task and fine-tunes it for four epochs on the pre-
processed training set. Figure 2 depicts the architecture of CatIss
and the fine-tuning process.

3 EXPERIMENT SETUP
In this section, first datasets and their characteristics are reviewed,
then the evaluation metrics are defined. And finally, implementation
details are presented.

3.1 Datasets
The training and test sets provided by the NLBSE workshop [4] are
used for training and evaluating the model. Training and test sets
contain 722899 and 80518 issue reports, respectively. The datasets
contain various types of information on issue reports including
time of creation, repository URL, issue URL, author association
role, label, title, and body. Issue reports are collected from 3093
repositories hosted on GitHub. There are six types of author associ-
ation rules available in the dataset, namely OWNER, MAINTAINER,
CONTRIBUTOR, COLLABORATOR, MEMBER, and MANNEQUIN.
Issues belong to one category of the three labels: bug, enhancement,
and question. About 8𝐾 of issues do not have a body text, that is,
they are lacking any description.

3.3 Implementation
The author uses HuggingFace Transformers 3, PyTorch 4, and Sim-
pleTransformers 5 libraries to train CatIss. She fine-tunes the pre-
trained RoBERTa model accessible through the HuggingFace API 6.
The author also sets the learning rate to 3𝑒 − 5, the number of
epochs to 4, the maximum input length to 200 and the training
and evaluation batch sizes to 100. Experiments are conducted on a
machine equipped with Ubuntu 16.04, 64-bit as the operating sys-
tem, two GeForce RTX 2080 GPU cards, AMD Ryzen Threadripper
1920X CPU with 12 core processors, and 64G RAM. Training lasts
for four hours and 20 minutes.

4 RESULTS
Table 1 presents CatIss’s results on classifying issues of the test
set compared to the provided baseline, TicketTagger [5] and an
additional baseline, Logistic Regression (LR) as a classical classifier.
As depicted, CatIss is outperforming the baselines, and achieving an
F1-score of 0.872 (micro average). Note that the more populated cat-
egories (Bug, and Enhancement), obtain higher classification results
for all metrics compared to the less-represented class Question. This
is probably due to two reasons; (1) the fewer number of samples for
this class, (2) the diversity of information and vocabulary in this cat-
egory. Nonetheless, CatIss significantly outperforms TicketTagger
for the Question category (by 89% based on the Recall). Compared
to Bug and Enhancement, “Question” is the least-represented class
in the datasets, and consequently has suffered from weak accuracy
scores in the previous studies. However, CatIss, utilizing contextual
information using its transformer architecture and the knowledge
transferred from the pre-trained model, is able to obtain higher
scores for this class, specifically for Recall and F1-measure. It is
worth mentioning that the author also performed a data ablation
study. The results of this experiment indicated that including and
concatenating the five sources of information reviewed in Sec-
tion 2.1 provide better results.

5 RELATED WORK
Kallis et al. [5, 6] has proposed TicketTagger, a tool based on Fast-
Text for classifying issues to three categories of Bug, Enhancement
and Question. These categories are among the default labels of the
GitHub issue system. They trained their model on the text (title and
description) of 30𝐾 issue reports from about 12𝐾 GitHub reposito-
ries. Their evaluation reports 82%, 76%, and 78% of precision/recall
scores for three classes of Bug, Enhancement, and Question, re-
spectively. Recently, BEE was proposed by Song and Chaparro [9],
which uses the pre-trained model of TicketTagger to label issues.
Then it proceeds to identify the structure of bug descriptions from
predicted reports that are predicted to be a bug in the issue-objective
prediction phase. In our recent study [2], we propose two models
to first extract issues’ objectives and then prioritize them using the
predicted objectives and other issue features. CatIss is based on this
study.

6 CONCLUSIONS
CatIss is an automatic categorizer of issue reports that is built upon
the Transformer-based pre-trained RoBERTa model. CatIss catego-
rizes issue reports into three main categories of Bug, Enhancement,
and Question. CatIss is trained on the provided training set for the
NLBSE tool competition and achieves 87.2% F1-score (micro aver-
age) on the test set. Specifically, CatIss significantly outperforms
TicketTagger, the main baseline by 89% based on the Recall score of
the Question class. Scripts for cleaning the datasets, training CatIss
and evaluating the model are publicly available. 7
