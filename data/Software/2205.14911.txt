Abstract

We describe the development of the theory of automatic groups. We
begin with a historical introduction, deﬁne the concepts of automatic,
biautomatic and combable groups, derive basic properties, then explain
how hyperbolic groups and the groups of compact 3-manifolds based
on six of Thurston’s eight geometries can be proved automatic. We
describe software developed in Warwick to compute automatic struc-
tures, as well as the development of practical algorithms that use those
structures. We explain how actions of groups on spaces displaying var-
ious notions of negative curvature can be used to prove automaticity
or biautomaticity, and show how these results have been used to de-
rive these properties for groups in some inﬁnite families (braid groups,
mapping class groups, families of Artin groups, and Coxeter groups).
Throughout the text we ﬂag up open problems as well as problems
that remained open for some time but have now been resolved.

Introduction

This chapter describes the development of the theory of automatic groups. It
aims to explain the deﬁnition, and put that into mathematical and historical
context, to detail what is known, give brief accounts of some of the big
problems in the subject that have already been solved, and describe those
problems that remain open.

Thurston is credited with the deﬁnition of automatic groups, and is one
of six authors of one of the primary early references of the subject [26];
but some of the foundations were laid in particular in work of Gromov on
hyperbolic groups [37], Cannon on properties of the fundamental groups of
compact hyperbolic manifolds [18], Gilman on groups with rational cross-
sections [36]. The standard reference is certainly the book [26], but that is
supplemented by some powerful results in [7, 34, 35], while Farb’s article [31]
gives a useful and readable overview of early development of the subject.

The deﬁnition of an automatic group was originally designed to identify
properties of a group that were observed in the fundamental groups of com-
pact hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and which facilitated computation with those
groups. Such groups are ﬁnitely generated. When a group is automatic, its
associated automatic structure allows the elements of the group to be rep-
resented as strings belonging to a particularly well structured set of strings,
for which certain computations can be easily performed using ﬁnite state
automata, as we shall see below.

Within this introductory section, we shall give some historical background,
then deﬁne the notation and terminology that we shall need in the remainder
of this chapter. Section 2 contains the deﬁnition of an automatic group,
identiﬁes the basic properties, and describes the most natural examples,
and non-examples. Section 3 describes computation with automatic groups,
how automatic structures may be computed, how they may, and have been,
used. Section 4 describes how automaticity or biautomaticity of a group may
be deduced from the geometry of a space on which the group has a good
action. Section 5 describes the derivation of results proving automaticity or
biautomaticity of groups in some well known families of group, which often
used techniques or results described in Section 4. Finally Section 6 describes
some problems that remain open.

1.1 Historical background

Alongside Thurston, it is natural to indentify Cannon, Epstein and Holt as
the key ﬁgures in the early development of automatic groups. Much of the

3

information in this section comes from discussion with these three people
[19, 30, 43], or can be found in the preface of the standard reference [26].

Cannon’s article [19] identiﬁes the International Congress of Mathematicians
in Helsinki in 1978 as a location at which key ideas that inﬂuenced the
development of the concept of an automatic group were discussed.

In his plenary address, Thurston discussed the construction of geometric
structures on a 3-manifold M , and the tesselation of its universal cover ˜M
by a structure dual to the Cayley graph of π1(M ). Thurston’s geometrisation
conjecture [72], subsequently proved by Perelman, claimed that every closed
3-manifold was geometrisable, that is, admitted a canonical decomposition
into pieces each admitting one of eight types of geometric structure.

In his article [19], Cannon attributes to Thurston at that conference the
conjecture that the growth series of a group G acting discretely, cocompactly
and isometrically on a ﬁnite dimensional hyperbolic space Hn should be a
rational function. Cannon proved that conjecture in [18], where he identiﬁed
features of Hn within the Cayley graph Cay(G, X) for G with respect to a
In particular, he proved that Cay(G, X) admits
ﬁnite generating set X.
ﬁnitely many types of “cones” on geodesics, and deduced from this the
rationality of the growth function of G. Cannon also proved that the word
and conjugacy problems for G could be solved using analogues of Dehn’s
algorithms for those in hyperbolic surface groups . Gromov’s 1987 article
[37] deﬁned a combinatorial notion of hyperbolicity for a graph, and hence for
a group (via its Cayley graph), and generalised Cannon’s results to groups
satisfying this deﬁnition of hyperbolicity. There is a substantial body of
material studying (Gromov) hyperbolic groups, in particular [2].

Thurston realised that the ﬁniteness of the set of cone types in one of Can-
non’s groups of hyperbolic isometries allowed the construction of a ﬁnite
state automaton recognising the set of geodesic words within the group;
rationality of the growth function is an immediate consequence of that set
of words being the language of a ﬁnite state automaton. “Fellow travel-
ling” properties of quasi-geodesic paths in Hn that had been recognised by
Cannon allowed the construction of further automata that recognised right
multiplication in the goup by a generator.

Now Thurston deﬁned the concept of an automatic group. He called a group
with ﬁnite generating set X automatic if it possessed a representative set of
words L over X, such that one ﬁnite state automaton recognised the words
in L, and other automata recognised pairs of words in L related in the group
under right multiplication by the generators in X. Very early on, groups of
this type were known as regular groups [43]. But this terminology conﬂicted
with other uses of the term regular, and so was soon changed.

4

Initially, in particular in [26, 7], the study of the family of automatic groups
was largely driven by the desire to ﬁnd within it the groups of the geometris-
able 3-manifolds, and hence to harness computational techniques that were
provided by the association of automatic groups with regular languages.
Epstein realised very early on that any automatic group must be ﬁnitely
presented, while Thurston deduced that any such group had quadratic Dehn
function and hence word problem soluble in quadratic time. Epstein and
Holt in Warwick worked, together with the author of this chapter, to develop
practical procedures to (attempt to) build automatic structures for ﬁnitely
presented groups, and to compute within the groups using those structures.

1.2 Mathematical background and notation

All the groups that we consider will be ﬁnitely generated. If X is a ﬁnite
generating set for a group G, then we write G = hXi. In that case every
element of G can be represented as a product (or string) of elements of X
and their inverses. We denote by X −1 the set of symbols x−1 for which
x ∈ X, and then by X ± the disjoint union of X and X −1; every non-
identity element of G can now be described as a string of elements of X ±.
The identity element, which we denote by 1, can be described as a product
of length 0.

Given a ﬁnite set A, we deﬁne a string w over A to be a sequence a1a2 · · · an
with ai ∈ A, and call n the length of w, denoted by |w|; we may alternatively
use the term word over A rather than string. A subsequence aiai+1 · · · aj of
w is called a substring or subword. We write w(i) for the preﬁx a1 · · · ai of
w. We call the string or word of length 0 over A the empty string or empty
word and denote that by ε. As is standard, we denote by A+ the set of all
strings over A of ﬁnite length > 0 and by A∗ the union A+ ∪ {ε}. Given
an ordering of the elements of A, we deﬁne the shortlex ordering on A∗ as
follows:
for words u = x1 . . . xr and v = y1 . . . ys , we deﬁne v <slex u if
|v| < |u|, or if |u| = |v| and for some i, y1 = x1, . . . , yi−1 = xi−1 but yi < xi.

When X is a generating set for a group G, and w ∈ (X ±)∗, it is often
convenient to abuse notation and use w to indicate not only that string over
X ± but also the group element that the string represents; if w, v ∈ X ±, we
write w = v to denote that w, v are identical as strings, and w =G v to
denote that w, v represent the same group element. If g ∈ G, we denote by
|g| the length of the shortest word over X ± that represents g. Suppose that
Cay = Cay(G, X) is the Cayley graph of G over X, that is the graph with
vertex set G and, for each g ∈ G, x ∈ X, directed edges labelled x and x−1
connecting the ordered pairs of vertices (g, gx) and (gx, g). Then for each
g ∈ G, a path labelled by w joins the vertex g of Cay to the vertex gw; we

5

shall represent that path as gw.

When G is ﬁnitely generated by X, we deﬁne a language for G over X to be
a subset of (X ±)∗ that contains at least one representative of each element
of G, that is, that maps onto G under the map assigning each product over
X to the element it represents.

For the free group Fn on a set X of n generators x1, . . . , xn, a language is
provided by the set of all freely reduced words of length ≥ 0 over X ±, that
is, the set of all words within which no subword xix−1
i xi appears.
For the free abelian group Zn on the same set of n generators, a language
i2 · · · xrk
is provided by the set of all words of the form xr1
, with k ≥ 0,

i1 < i2 < · · · < ik and ri ∈ Z \ {0}.
In each of these two examples the
language provides a unique representative for each group element.

Each of the two languages just described is an example of a regular language,
that is, it is the set L(M ) of strings accepted by a ﬁnite state automaton (fsa)
M with alphabet {x±1
n }. Finite state automata provide stan-
dard models of bounded memory computation and are deﬁned and studied
in [46]. It is common to represent a ﬁnite state automaton M with alpha-
bet A as a ﬁnite directed graph, with each directed edge labelled by one or
more elements of A, one vertex identiﬁed as the start, and a subset of the
vertices selected as accepting. A word w is then accepted by M if it labels at
least one directed path from the start to an accepting vertex; if there is no
such path, or if the end point (target) of every such path is a non-accepting
vertex then w is not accepted. It is standard to call the vertices of M its
states, the directed edges its transitions and the set of accepted words its
language L(M ). In the cases where n = 2, the languages described above
for the free and free abelian groups over {a, b} are accepted by the two ﬁnite
state automata shown in Figure 1; in each diagram, following convention,
the start state is indicated by an arrow, and the accepting states are ringed.
In each of the two examples, each of the ﬁve states shown in the diagram is
accepting, but a further failure state is not shown, which constitutes a sixth
state; the failure state is non-accepting, any transitions not shown in the
diagram are assumed to be to that failure state, and all transitions from the
failure state are to the failure state.

max{|w|, |v|} the distance between the vertices w(i) and v(i) of Cay =
Cay(G, X) (using the graph metric) is at most k. Equivalently, we say that
the paths 1w and 1v of Cay k-fellow travel. A group G with ﬁnite generating
set X is deﬁned to be automatic over X if

A1 there is a language L for G over X that is regular,

A2 there is an integer k such that, for each y ∈ X ∪ {1}, and for any
w, v ∈ L with wy =G v, the paths 1w, 1v k-fellow travel in Cay.

We call L the language, the fsa accepting L the word acceptor and k the
fellow traveller constant of an automatic structure for G.

The fsa M1 illustrated in Figure 1 is the word acceptor of an automatic
structure with fellow traveller constant 1 for F2 over {a, b}; each element
of the group has a unique representative in the language, and given two
words w, v ∈ L(M1) and y ∈ {a±1, b±} with wy =F2 v, one of the words is a
maximal preﬁx of the other, and so the words 1-fellow travel in G.

Similarly, the fsa M2 of Figure 1 is the word acceptor of an automatic struc-
ture with fellow traveller constant 2 for Z2 over {a, b}. Again each element
of the group has a unique representative in the language, and given two
words w, v ∈ L(M2) and y ∈ {a±1, b±1} with wy =Z2 v, corresponding ver-
tices on the paths 1w and 1v in Cay(Z2, {a, b}) are joined in the graph by
a path of length 1 or 2. The language L(M2) is the set of all Shortlex
minimal geodesic representatives of group elements; we call this a short-
lex automatic structure for Z2. Note that we can deﬁne a similar shortlex
automatic structure for Zn.

7

In the deﬁnition of automaticity given in [26] the condition A2 given above
is replaced by the following condition:

A2’ For each y ∈ X ∪ {{1}}, the set of pairs (w, v) for which w, v ∈ L and
wy =G v is a regular language when viewed as a set of strings over the
alphabet of pairs {(a, b) : a, b ∈ X ± ∪{$}}; the character $ is a padding
symbol used to deal with the situation where |w| 6= |v|, in which case
the shorter of the two words is padded with $s at its end.

The automata recognising the regular languages just described are known
as the multiplier automata of the automatic structure, usually denoted by
My, for each choice of y.

In the presence of A1 the conditions A2 and A2’ are equivalent. This is a
consequence of the fact that the k-fellow travelling of a pair of words w, v can
be tracked by an automaton whose state set D corresponds to a set of words
of length at most k; a pair of words (w, v) is accepted by that automaton so
long as all the products w′−1v′ associated with preﬁxes w′ := w(i), v′ := v(i)
of w, v are represented by words in D. We call such an automaton a word
diﬀerence machine, and the associated set D its corresponding set of word
diﬀerences.

Where G is automatic over its ﬁnite generating set X, with automatic struc-
ture L, k, then G is said to be biautomatic (and (L, k) to be a biautomatic
structure for G) if the additional condition A3 is satisﬁed:

A3 for each y ∈ X, and for any w, v ∈ L with yw =G v, the paths yw, 1v

k-fellow travel in Cay(G, X).

This further fellow traveller condition can be expressed in terms of fsa that
recognise left multiplication, usually denoted by yM , for y ∈ X. It is an
open question whether all automatic groups are biautomatic.

The concept of automaticity can be generalised to one of asynchronous auto-
maticity by replacing the fellow traveller condition by an asynchronous fellow
travel condition; for two words w, v to asynchronously fellow travel within
a group G it is the distance between vertices w(ji) and v(ki) that must be
bounded, where, for some m ≥ max(|w|, |v|), the sequences (j0, j1, . . . , jm)
and (k0, . . . , km) are both increasing sequences of integers, with j0 = k0 = 0,
jm = |w|, km = |v|, and for 0 ≤ l < m, jl+1 − jl and kl+1 − kl are in {0, 1}.
Asynchronous automaticity is certainly a more general concept than auto-
maticity, and it is satisﬁed by examples such as the Baumslag–Solitar groups
which are certainly not automatic.

8

It is fairly standard to call a language L for a group G that satisﬁes the
condition A2 (but not necessarily A1) a combing for G, and a language
that satisﬁes both A2 and A3 a bicombing for G; however some authors use
these terms diﬀerently, e.g. impose additional (geometric) conditions on L.
Again, the fellow travelling condition can be replaced by an asynchronous
one, in order to deﬁne asynchronous combings and bicombings. The basic
properties of combable groups are studied in [12], where it is proved that
non-automatic combable groups exist (answering a question posed in [26]),
as well as combable groups that are not bicombable.

Given an automatic (or biautomatic) structure (L, k) for a group G, it is
straightforward (using well known properties of regular languages, such as
the “Pumping lemma” [46]) to modify the structure and achieve a new au-
tomatic structure with particular properties. For instance we can achieve a
structure in which every element of G has a unique representative (a struc-
ture with uniqueness) a preﬁx closed structure in which the language contains
every preﬁx of every one of its elements, a quasigeodesic structure in which
every element is represented by a (λ, ǫ)-quasigeodesic, We note that a word
w representing an element g of a group G is called a (λ, ǫ)-quasigeodesic if
every subword w′ of w has length at most λ|g′| + ǫ, where g′ is the element
represented by w′. Note that it is not clear that all combinations of proper-
ties can be achieved within the language of a single automatic structure. In
particular it is an open question [26] whether, given an automatic structure
for a group G, an automatic structure can be derived for G that is both
preﬁx closed and has uniqueness.

Note that the deﬁnitions of automaticity and biautomaticity are independent
of choice of generating set; that is if G has an automatic structure over a
ﬁnite generating set X, then it has one over any other ﬁnite generating set
Y .

2.2 Basic properties of automatic groups

Some properties of automatic groups can be deduced very easily from ba-
sic properties of regular languages, which imply certain constraints on their
Cayley graphs. In particular any automatic group is ﬁnitely presented with
soluble word problem, and quadratic Dehn function, while any biautomatic
group has soluble conjugacy problem. We recall that the word problem is
soluble in G if an algorithm exists that can decide whether or not any in-
put word represents the identity, and the conjugacy problem is soluble if an
algorithm exists that can decide whether or not two input words represent
elements that are conjugate within the group; it is an open question whether
the conjugacy problem is soluble for automatic groups. It also is an open

9

question whether the isomorphism problem is soluble for automatic groups,
that is, whether an algorithm that was given as input automatic structures
for a pair of groups G, H could decide whether or not G and H were iso-
morphic. It is conjectured in [26] that this problem is insoluble. Note that
it is soluble for hyperbolic groups [24, 70].

In order to explain these statements in more detail, we use the language
Informally (essentially, following [53]), given a
of van Kampen diagrams.
group G with presentation hX | Ri and a word w over X that represents
the identity of G, we deﬁne a van Kampen diagram ∆w for w to be a ﬁnite,
connected, directed, planar graph, with a selected basepoint, whose directed
edges are labelled by elements of X, in such a way that the boundary of every
face of the graph (known as a cell) is labelled (from some starting point, in
some orientation) by a word from R, while the boundary of the graph is
labelled (from the basepoint) by w. As a directed, edge labelled graph, ∆w
maps (not necessarily injectively) into the Cayley graph Cay(G, X). The
area of the diagram Area(∆w) is deﬁned to be the number of cells it contains;
of course its value is dependent on the set R, and would change if R were
changed.

We deﬁne the area of the word w to be the minimum of the areas of all van
Kampen diagrams that represent w. And we deﬁne the Dehn function (or
isoperimetric function) for G, f : N → N, to be the function for which f (n)
is the maximum area of all words w of length n over X ± that represent
the identity of G. Although the precise form of the Dehn function depends
on the chosen presentation for G, it can be shown that two Dehn functions
corresponding to diﬀerent presentatives are related by a natural notion of
equivalence, and in particular if one is polynomially bounded, then both are,
by polynomials of the same degree.

Proposition 2.1. Every automatic group is ﬁnitely presented, with a quadratic
upper bound on the Dehn function, and hence soluble word problem.

We sketch the proof, which is that of [45, Theorem 5.2.13].

Proof. We suppose that L, k are the language and fellow traveller constant
of an automatic structure over a generating set X; we may assume that L
consists of quasigeodesics. Suppose that w = a1 · · · an is a word of length n
representing the identity. Now we deﬁne words w0, . . . , wn as follows. We
deﬁne w0 = wn to be a representative in L of 1, and for each i = 1, . . . , n − 1
we choose wi to be a representative in L of the preﬁx of w of length i; since
L is quasigeodesic, we can choose wi of length at most |w0| + Ci, for some
constant C of the automatic structure. We start with a disk within the
plane whose boundary is labelled by w, and divide it into cells to form a

10

van Kampen diagram ∆w with boundary w as follows. First, a loop labelled
by w0 connects the basepoint to itself, while for each i a path labelled wi
connects the basepoint to the point on the boundary distance i along w, and
none of these paths cross each other. Then, since the paths 1wi−1 and 1wi
in Cay(G, X) fellow travel at distance at most k, we can construct paths of
length at most k that connect corresponding vertices on the paths within
the disk labelled by those two words, and hence divide the region between
the two paths into cells each of length at most 2k + 2. In this way we divide
the interior of the diagram into a number of cells labelled by words of length
at most 2k + 2. together with two cells labelled by the word w0 = wn, as
illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Van Kampen diagram for a representative of the identity in an
automatic group

Using the bounds on |wi|, we see that the total number of cells is bounded
by a quadratic function of n. We now deﬁne R to be the set of all words
of length up to 2k + 2 that represent the identity, together with the word
w0. Then hX | Ri is a ﬁnite presentation for G, and, relative to R, ∆w has
quadratic area.

A similar argument proves an exponential upper bound on the Dehn function
for any asynchronously automatic group; it is an open question [26] whether
a polynomial time solution to the word problem must exist.

The most straightforward way to prove a group non-automatic is probably
to show that it has a Dehn function that is above quadratic. This argument
proves easily the non-automaticity of the Baumslag–Solitar groups ha, b |
bapb−1 = aq for which p, q > 0 and p 6= q, since they have exponential Dehn

11

function; in fact they provide examples of non-automatic groups that are
asynchronously automatic.

But there are many groups with quadratic Dehn functions that are known
by other methods not to be automatic.

The non-automaticity of the groups SLn(Z) for n ≥ 3 is proved in [26]. The
group SL2(Z) is well known to be virtually free, and hence hyperbolic with
linear Dehn function. The group SL3(Z) has exponential Dehn function
and so is certainly non-automatic. However, the existence of a quadratic
Dehn function for SLn(Z) with n ≥ 5 was proved in [77] in 2013 (and
had been conjectured by Thurston, in fact for n ≥ 4). In order to prove
non-automaticity of the group for all n ≥ 3, Epstein and Thurston derived
higher dimensional isoperimetric inequalities that would have to hold in any
combable group of isometries acting properly discontinuously with compact
quotient on a k-connected Riemannian manifold [26, Theorem 10.3.5]. The
non-automaticity of SLn(Z) now follows by the construction of a proper
discontinous cocompact action on a suitable contractible manifold, and the
demonstration that a higher dimensional isoperimetric inequality fails; hence
SLn(Z) is proved to be non-combable and so non-automatic.

Van Kampen diagrams can also be used to prove solubility of the conjugacy
problem in any biautomatic group, by demonstrating the existence of a
conjugator of bounded length. The proof below, valid for any bicombable
group, is taken from [71]; an earlier result of [35] constructs an automaton
out of the biautomatic structure to solve the problem.

Proposition 2.2. Given a biautomatic group G, any two words u, v rep-
resenting conjugate elements are conjugate by an element of length at most
a|u|+|v|, for some constant a (depending only on the biautomatic structure).
Hence any biautomatic group has soluble conjugacy problem.

Proof. We choose a biautomatic structure (L, k) over a ﬁnite generating set
X, and suppose that the words u, v over X ± represent conjugate elements
of G. Let N := |X ±|k(|u|+|v|). We ﬁnd a conjugator of length at most N ,
and so a = |X ±|k.

For suppose that an element g ∈ G conjugates u to v, that is that gu =G vg,
and that w, w′ ∈ L represent the elements g and ug, respectively. We
consider the paths 1w, 1w′ and uw within the Cayley graph Cay(G, X),
and see that the biautomaticity of G ensures that 1w and 1w′ fellow travel
at distance at most |u|k, and that 1w′ and uw fellow travel at distance
at most |v|k. We deduce that we can construct a van Kampen diagram
with boundary labelled by wuw−1v−1 in which chords of length at most
(|u| + |v|)k join boundary vertices in corresponding positions on the two

12

boundary subwords labelled by w, as shown on the left hand side of Figure 3.
Where |w| = n, let d1, d2, . . . , dn−1 be the words that label those chords.

Now if n > |X ±|(|u|+|v|)k, then for some i, j we have di = dj. In that case,
where ˆw is the word formed from w by deleting its middle section of length
j − i, from its (i + 1)-th to its j-th letter, we can form the van Kampen
diagram with boundary word ˆwu ˆw−1v−1 shown on the right hand side of
Figure 3 by deleting the central part of the diagram we already constructed
for wuw−1v−1.

Various combinations of automatic groups are known to be automatic [26, 7]:
these include free products, direct products, certain amalgamated products
and HNN extensions of automatic groups, as well as subgroups of ﬁnite index
in automatic groups, groups with automatic groups as subgroups of ﬁnite
index, quotients of automatic groups by ﬁnite normal subgroups. Some, but
not all, of these closure properties also hold for biautomatic groups. It is an
open question whether direct factors of automatic groups must be automatic
(but the analogous result is proved for biautomatic groups [61]). It is also
open [26] whether a group with a biautomatic group as a subgroup of ﬁnite
index must be biautomatic.

2.3 Basic examples and non-examples

2.3.1 Virtually abelian groups, soluble groups

We already described shortlex automatic structures for the free abelian
group Zn. In fact Zn is also biautomatic, but with a diﬀerent (less straight-
forward) language, and indeed so is every virtually abelian group. However
it was already proved in [26] that an automatic nilpotent group must be
virtually abelian; the proof uses the fact that a regular language with poly-
nomial growth cannot satisfy a (synchronous) fellow traveller property. It
was conjectured by Thurston that the same result must hold for an auto-
matic soluble group. That conjecture remains open, but it was proved for
automatic polycylic groups in [39], using an embedding of a ﬁnite index
subgroup of a polycyclic group of exponential growth as a lattice in an ap-
propriate Lie group, where [26, Theorem 10.3.5] about higher dimensional
isoperimetric functions could be applied, which had previously been used to
prove the non-automaticity of SLn(Z) for n ≥ 3. Much more recently it was
proved in [69] that biautomatic soluble groups must be virtually abelian.

2.3.2 Hyperbolic groups

Maybe the most natural examples of non-abelian automatic groups are pro-
vided by the large family of word hyperbolic groups, which contains all
ﬁnitely generated free groups as well as the fundamental groups of all com-
pact hyperbolic manifolds.

A group G with ﬁnite generating set X is said to be word hyperbolic if its
Cayley graph Cay(G, X) is a δ-hyperbolic metric space, for some δ ≥ 0; a
geodesic metric space (X , d) is δ-hyperbolic if for any triangle in X with
geodesic sides γ1, γ2, γ3 and for any vertex p on the side γ1 there is a vertex
q on the union γ2 ∪ γ3 of the other two sides for which d(p, q) < δ (we say
that triangles in X are δ-slim). The property of being word hyperbolic is
independent of the choice of a ﬁnite generating set for G, although the value
of δ is not. The fundamental groups of compact hyperbolic manifolds give
examples, as do ﬁnitely generated free groups (which are 0-hyperbolic with
respect to free generating sets).

We note that there are many equivalent deﬁnitions of hyperbolicity for met-
ric spaces (and hence for ﬁnitely generated groups), which are explained in
[2]. In particular there is a characterisation in terms of thin rather than slim
triangles (and a linear relationship between the associated parameters “δ”).

It is proved in [26] that a word hyperbolic group G is automatic over any

14

generating set X, with an automatic structure whose language consists of
all geodesic words over the selected generating set. The regularity of that
set of geodesic words is equivalent to the fact that the Cayley graph Cay =
Cay(G, X) contains ﬁnitely many cone types. For g ∈ G, represented by a
geodesic word w, we deﬁne the cone C(g) (or C(w)) on the vertex g of Cay
to be the set of (geodesic) paths γ within Cay starting at g for which the
concatenation ηγ of a geodesic path η from 1 to g with γ is also geodesic.
The cone type [C(g)] or [C(w)] of the cone is deﬁned to be the set of words
that label the paths within it. Now for y ∈ X ∪ X −1, if wy is also geodesic
then for any word v,

v ∈ [C(wy)] ⇐⇒ yv ∈ [C(w)].

It follows that we can recognise the set of geodesic words over X ± with an
fsa whose states correspond to the cone types, with a transition from [C(w)]
to [C(wy)] on y whenever wy is geodesic, but otherwise to a single failure
state (i.e. a non-accepting sink state). We can illustrate this construction
in the free abelian group Z2 with generating set {a, b}, where there are nine
cone types [C(w)], deﬁned by the nine geodesic words ε, a, b, a−1, b−1, ab,
ab−1, a−1b, a−1b−1, and consisting of the nine possible sets of geodesic words
in which each generator appears either only with positive exponent, or only
with negative exponent, or not at all. The fsa is illustrated in Figure 4. This
automaton is not part of an automatic structure for Z2; it cannot be since,
for example, the vertices distance i from the origin on the geodesic words
aibi and biai are distance 2i apart within the Cayley graph, and hence this
language does not satisfy a fellow travelling property.

Given the ﬁniteness of the set of cone types in a word hyperbolic group, biau-
tomaticity of any word hyperbolic group now follows once it is observed that

15

the fellow travelling of two geodesic words with common (or adjacent) start
and end vertices can be derived from the slimness of triangles. In fact, it
is proved by Papasoglu [67] that this fellow traveller condition characterises
word hyperbolic groups, and hence so does the existence of a (bi)automatic
structure that consists of all geodesic words. A procedure to test for hy-
perbolicity that is based on this result is described in [75]. Starting with
a shortlex automatic structure (L, k) for a group G over X, the procedure
attempts to construct an automatic structure (bL, bk) with bL ⊃ L and bk ≥ k,
and such that bL contains all geodesic words over X ±.
It will terminate
with such a structure precisely when G is hyperbolic. An improved proce-
dure, based on the same result was developed by Holt and Epstein [27] and
implemented in kbmag.

The fundamental groups of ﬁnite volume hyperbolic manifolds (geometri-
cally ﬁnite hyperbolic groups) were proved biautomatic by Epstein [26],
with a further biautomatic structure subsequently described by Lang [55].

Geometrically ﬁnite hyperbolic groups were the motivating examples for
Bowditch’s deﬁnition [9] of a group hyperbolic relative to a collection of
subgroups; a geometrically ﬁnite hyperbolic group is hyperbolic relative to
a collection of abelian groups. The major part of the deﬁnition of relative hy-
perbolicity is the requirement that the Cayley graph of a group hyperbolic
relative to a collection H of subgroups becomes hyperbolic after the con-
traction of edges within left cosets of subgroups in H. However weaker and
stronger versions of the deﬁnition exist depending on whether or not a con-
dition of bounded coset penetration is required to hold. Under the stronger
deﬁnition (studied in [66]) it is proved, in particular in [5], that groups hy-
perbolic relative to shortlex biautomatic subgroups are themselves shortlex
biautomatic. The shortlex biautomaticity of geometrically ﬁnite hyperbolic
groups is a consequence of this result.

A further generalisation of hyperbolic groups is provided by semihyperbolic
groups, which were introduced by Bridson and Alonso in [3]; the class con-
tains all biautomatic groups (hence all hyperbolic groups) and all CAT(0)
groups (see Section 4). A group G with ﬁnite generating set X is deﬁned
to be weakly semihyperbolic if Cay(G, X) admits a bounded quasi-geodesic
bicombing (with a unique combing path sg1,g2(t) identiﬁed between any pair
g1, g2 of vertices of the graph), and semihyperbolic if it has such a bicombing
that is equivariant under the action of G (so that g.sg1,g2(g) = sgg1,gg2(t)).
This class of groups satisﬁes many closure properties, and all groups within
it are ﬁnitely presented, with soluble word and conjugacy problems.

16

2.3.3 Fundamental groups of compact 3-manifolds

It is proved in [26] that the fundamental groups of compact 3-manifolds
based on six of Thurston’s eight model geometries for compact 3-manifolds
[73] admit automatic structures. But it is also proved that the fundamen-
tal groups of closed manifolds based on the Nil and Sol geometries (which
are non-abelian, nilpotent and soluble, respectively) cannot even be asyn-
chronously automatic [26, 10].

However, using combination theorems for automatic groups, it can be proved
(as in [26, Theorem 12.4.7], but our wording is slightly diﬀerent) that an
orientable, connected, compact 3-manifold with incompressible toral bound-
ary whose prime factors have JSJ decompositions containing only hyperbolic
pieces has automatic fundamental group. It was proved in [13, Theorem B]
that the fundamental group of a manifold as above in which manifolds based
on Nil and Sol are allowed within the JSJ decomposition, while not auto-
matic, still admits an asynchronous combing based on an indexed language
[1].

3 Computing with automatic groups

3.1 Building automatic structures

The original motivation for the deﬁnition of automatic groups was compu-
tational, and so it was important from the beginning of the subject to be
able to construct automatic structures, that is, given a presentation for a
group G, to have a mechanism for building the word acceptor and multi-
plier automata of an associated automatic structure. Software to build these
automata was developed at the University of Warwick, and the procedure
used is described in [29]. The original programs were subsequently rewritten
by Holt, and released within his kbmag package [54], now available within
both GAP and Magma computational systems [33, 59].

The basic procedure is the same in both versions (the ideas are due to Holt)
and we describe it brieﬂy now, but refer the reader to [29] or [42] for more
details.

A presentation for a group G over a ﬁnite generating set X is input, to-
gether with an ordering of the set X ±. The procedure attempts to prove
G to be shortlex automatic over X (with the given ordering) by ﬁrst con-
structing a set of automata consisting of W and My for y ∈ X ± ∪ {ε}, and
then attempting to verify that those automata are indeed the automata of a

17

shortlex automatic structure. If veriﬁcation tests fail, some looping is possi-
ble within the procedure, and indeed that looping could continue indeﬁnitely
(or at least until the computer runs out of resources). If all veriﬁcation tests
pass, then the procedure will have veriﬁed the shortlex automaticity of G
by construction and checking of a shortlex automatic structure.

So the procedure may succeed in proving shortlex automaticity of G. But
if it fails, it has certainly not proved that G is not automatic, or even
that G is not shortlex automatic, but rather it suggests that G is unlikely
to be shortlex automatic over the given generating set X, with the given
ordering of the elements of X. We note that the question of automaticity
for a ﬁnitely presented group is undecidable in general; this follows from the
undecidability of questions such as triviality for a group. We note too that
it is an open question [26] whether every automatic group must be shortlex
automatic with respect to some ordered generating set.

The ﬁrst step of the procedure to prove shortlex automaticity is the con-
struction of a rewrite system R from the group presentation that is compat-
ible with the shortlex order. By deﬁnition, R is a set of substitution rules
ρ : u → v, for u, v ∈ (X ±)∗, and with v <slex u; in order that R encodes the
presentation we require that every relator from the group presentation is a
cyclic conjugate of the product uv−1 or its inverse for at least one such rule.

The next step is to run the Knuth–Bendix procedure for a while on R. The
Knuth–Bendix procedure (described in [45]) is a general procedure that,
given as input a rewrite system R for strings compatible with a partial
order, modiﬁes it by adding rules that are consequences of existing rules
and deleting rules that have become redundant, in order to produce a new
rewrite system. The procedure attempts to build a ﬁnite complete system,
for which any input word w can be rewritten after a ﬁnite number of steps
to a unique irreducible word w′ (where irreducible means that w′ cannot
be rewritten further). However with this goal the procedure may never
terminate; all that is guaranteed is that after bounded time the modiﬁed
system must contain enough rules to reduce any word up to some bounded
length to an irreducible.

In fact the procedure to construct a shortlex automatic structure for G does
not need the Knuth–Bendix procedure to terminate on the input rewrite
system R. Instead, while the Knuth–Bendix procedure is running it accu-
mulates the set D of word diﬀerences u(i)−1v(i) and their inverses (reduced
according to the current modiﬁcation of R) that correspond to preﬁxes of
the rules u → v in the system. Where u = u1 · · · um, and v = v1 · · · vm′, a
transition is added from each word diﬀerence u(i)−1v(i) to u(i+1)−1v(i+1),
creating a word diﬀerence machine that can recognise fellow travelling with
respect to D.

18

The Knuth–Bendix procedure is paused when it seems that the set D and the
associated automaton have stabilised. And then a candidate word acceptor
WA is constructed, designed to reject a word u if a string v exists with
v <slex u for which (u, v) fellow travels according to D while also the word
diﬀerence u−1v reduces, according to the current rewrite system, to the
empty word.

Similarly, multiplier automata are constructed for each y ∈ X ± ∪ {ε}, using
a direct product construction on automata to recognise pairs of words u, v
for which u, v ∈ L(W ), (u, v) fellow travels according to D, while also the
word diﬀerence u−1v reduces, according to the current rewrite system, to y.

Now a series of elementary tests is applied to the candidate automata. If
some of these tests fail, then D has been proved to be inadequate, and the
Knuth–Bendix procedure is restarted. If and when those tests are passed,
further tests known as axiom checking are applied, and a positive result for
these tests proves the automata to provide a shortlex automatic structure
for G. If the axiom checks fail then the procedure is abandoned.

3.2 Calculation using the automatic structure

Once an automatic structure has been constructed for a group G, much
can be computed using the automata of that structure. Various of these
functions are available within the kbmag package [54].

It is straightforward to enumerate the language of a ﬁnite state automaton.
Hence we can enumerate a set of representative words for an automatic
group, with unique representation if necessary (recall that once an automatic
structure has been derived, a structure with unique representation can be
derived from that).

For any regular language L the generating function P∞
n=0 sL(n)xn, where
sL(n) denotes the number of words of length n in L, is a rational function,
and can be computed from an automaton recognising L. Hence the growth
series of an automatic group is computable, given a geodesic automatic
structure.

Reduction of an input word to the “normal form” deﬁned by the language
L of the automatic structure for G can be performed using a combination of
the word acceptor and multiplier automata, or alternatively using the word
diﬀerence machine.

Finiteness of otherwise of an automatic group is immediately recognisable
from a word acceptor for an automatic structure; the language is inﬁnite

19

In this way, the Heineken
precisely when the automaton admits loops.
group G = hx, y, z | [x, [x, y]] = z, [y, [y, z]] = x, [z, [z, x]] = yi was proved
inﬁnite, by Holt using kbmag; computation with the automatic structure
subsequently revealed the group to be hyperbolic. Previously that group
had been proposed as a possible example of a ﬁnite group with a balanced
presentation. Similarly, a second proof of the inﬁniteness of the Fibonacci
group F (2, 9) was provided by the construction of an automatic structure
for it [41].

Tests for hyperbolicity [75, 27] that make use of automatic structures for G
together with Papasoglu’s characterisation of hyperbolic groups have already
been described in Section 2.3.2. The second of those is implemented in
kbmag, as is an algorithm [27] estimating the thinness constant (related to,
but not equal to, the slimness constant) for geodesic triangles in the Cayley
graph of a word hyperbolic group.

Quadratic and linear time solutions to the conjugacy problem in a hyperbolic
group are described in [15] and [28, 17]. A practical cubic time solution that
restricts to inﬁnite order elements is due to Marshall [58], using some ideas
from Swenson, and has been implemented in the GAP system.

4 Group actions and negative curvature

One of the basic principles of geometric group theory is generally referred
to as the the Milnor–˘Svarc lemma:

If a group G has a “nice” (properly discontinuous and cocompact) discrete,
isometric action on a metric space X then its Cayley graph is quasi-isometric
to X . In particular a group with such an action on a δ-hyperbolic space is
word hyperbolic.

A variety of results derive automaticity or biautomaticity of a group from
its “nice” actions on spaces in which some kind of non-positive curvature
can be found.

Theorem 4.1 (Gersten, Short, 1990, 1991 [34, 35]). A group acting dis-
cretely and ﬁxed point freely on a piecewise Euclidean 2-complex of type
A1 × A1, A2, B2 or G2 (corresponding to tesselations of the Euclidean plane
by squares, equilateral triangles, or triangles with angles (π/2, π/4, π/4) or
(π/2, π/3, π/6)) is biautomatic.

As a consequence of the above results, and within the same two articles,
Gersten and Short deduce that groups satisfying any of the small cancella-
tion conditions C(7) or else T(p) and T(q) with (p, q) ∈ {(3, 7), (4, 5), (5, 4)}

20

(deﬁned in [57]) are hyperbolic, and hence in particular biautomatic, and
then that groups satisfying the small cancellation conditions C(6), or C(4)
and T(4), or C(3) and T(6) are biautomatic.

A geodesic metric space X is deﬁned to be CAT(0) if for any geodesic triangle
in the space, and for any two points p, q on the sides of that triangle, the
distance between p and q in X is no more than the distance between the
points in corresponding positions on the sides of a geodesic triangle with
the same side lengths in the Euclidean plane, as illustrated in Figure 5. A
complete CAT(0) space is often called a Hadamard space. A group is called
CAT(0) if it acts properly and cocompactly on a CAT(0) space.

Figure 5: Comparable triangles in Euclidean and CAT(0) spaces

The CAT(-1) condition is deﬁned similarly with respect to the hyperbolic
plane; any CAT(-1) space is δ-hyperbolic, for some δ, and hence CAT(-1)
groups are word hyperbolic.

A (not necessarily geodesic) metric space (X, d) is said to have non-positive
curvature (or curvature ≤ 0) if every point of X is contained in a CAT(0)
neighbourhood. By the Cartan-Hadamard theorem [14] the universal cover
of a complete connected space of non-positive curvature is CAT(0).

Niblo and Reeves studied in particular groups acting on CAT(0) cube com-
plexes:

Theorem 4.2 (Niblo, Reeves 1998 [64]). A group acting faithfully, properly
discontinuously and cocompactly on a simply connected and non-positively
curved cube complex is biautomatic.

A cube complex is deﬁned to be a metric polyhedral complex in which each
cell is isometric to the Euclidean cube with side lengths 1, where the gluing
maps are isometries. Such a complex is non-positively curved provided that
it contains at most one edge joining any two vertices, and no triangles of

21

edges, and (by a result of Gromov [37]) is CAT(0) if non-positively curved
and simply connected.

Actions of Coxeter groups on CAT(0) cube complexes are constructed in
[65], but are not necessarily cocompact. However in some cases it follows
from those or related constructions that the Coxeter groups are biautomatic
(see Section 5.2).

There are many open problems relating to CAT(0) groups (see for example
[32]). The question of whether every CAT(0) group must be biautomatic
was recently resolved in the negative by Leary and Minasyan [56], who
constructed an example of a 3-dimensional CAT(0) group which could admit
no biautomatic subgroup of ﬁnite index. It is still unknown whether non-
automatic CAT(0) groups can exist.

However a restricted class of CAT(0) groups is provided by groups that act
geometrically on CAT(0) spaces with isolated ﬂats. A k-ﬂat in a CAT(0)
space is an isometrically embedded copy of Euclidean space Rk. This fam-
ily contains a number of interesting examples, including geometrically ﬁnite
Kleinian groups, the fundamental groups of various compact manifolds, and
limit groups, arising from the solutions of equations over free groups. Groups
of this type are studied in [48], where more details (of deﬁnition and exam-
ples) can be found. Theorem 1.2.2 of that article establishes a number of
properties of such groups, including their biautomaticity.

A form of non-positive curvature in simplicial complexes is deﬁned in [52]: a
ﬂag simplicial complex X is called k-systolic if connected, simply connected
and locally k-large (no minimal ℓ-cycle with 3 < ℓ < k in the link of a vertex).
A group is called k-systolic if it acts simplicially, properly discontinuously
and cocompactly on a k-systolic simplical complex, and is called systolic if
6-systolic.

Theorem 4.3 (Januszkiewicz, Swiatkowski, 2006 [52]). 7-systolic groups
are hyperbolic, 6-systolic groups are biautomatic.

This result is used to prove biautomaticity of a large class of Artin groups
[49], as detailed in Section 5.1.

A Helly graph is a graph in which every family of pairwise intersecting balls
has a non-empty intersection. A group is called Helly if it acts properly and
cocompactly by graph automorphisms on a Helly graph; word hyperbolic
groups, CAT(0) cubical groups and C(4)-T(4) small cancellation groups are
all examples. It is proved in [22] that all Helly groups are biautomatic. This
result is used to prove biautomaticity of another large class of Artin groups
[50], as detailed in Section 5.1.

5 Some automatic and biautomatic families

Over a period of more than 30 years, automatic and biautomatic structures
were found for various families of groups, including braid groups, many Artin
groups, mapping class groups, and Coxeter groups. But some questions
remain open for these families.

5.1 Braid groups, Artin groups and Mapping Class groups

Automatic structures for the braid group Bn on n strands and also for the
(closely related) mapping class group of the (n + 1)-punctured sphere were
constructed by Thurston and are described in [26]; one of the structures
described for the braid groups is symmetric, proving the braid groups to be
biautomatic. The automaticity (but not necessarily biautomaticity) of the
mapping class group of the n + 1-punctured sphere then follows from the
fact that it contains the quotient of the braid group Bn by its centre as a
subgroup of index n + 1.

The braid group on n + 1 strands is isomorphic to the Artin group of ﬁnite
type An. We recall that an Artin group is a group deﬁned by a presentation
of the form

relating to a symmetric, integer Coxeter matrix (mij), or equivalently a Cox-
eter diagram Γ on n vertices, whose edge {i, j} is labelled mij, and is naturally
associated with a Coxeter group by adding relations x2
i = 1 for each i. The
Artin group has ﬁnite type if the associated Coxeter group is ﬁnite (and
hence Γ is a disjoint union of diagrams from the well–known list of spherical
Coxeter diagrams).

In [23], Charney used results of Deligne to extend Thurston’s construction
for the braid groups to all ﬁnite type Artin groups. Charney’s construction
provided biautomatic structures for all ﬁnite type Artin groups; these bi-
automatic structures were geodesic over the “Garside” generating sets, but
not over the standard generators xi. Biautomatic structures for all Garside
groups (of which ﬁnite type Artin groups are examples) were described by
Dehornoy [25].

For Artin groups of FC type (free products of ﬁnite type groups with amal-
gamation over parabolic subgroups, for which the complete subgraphs of the
labelled graph formed by deleting all ∞-labelled edges from Γ are all of ﬁ-
nite type), asynchronously automatic structures were constructed in [4], and

23

used to deﬁne quadratic time solutions to the word problem; we recall that
an exponential (rather then quadratic) time solution is guaranteed by asyn-
chronous automaticity. Right-angled Artin groups (those for which all the
parameters mij are within the set {2, ∞}, which form a subset of FC type)
were then proved automatic in [40, 74]. Very recently [50] Artin groups of
FC type have been proved to be Helly, and hence biautomatic.

Mosher’s paper [60] answered a major open question raised by Thurston’s
proof of the automaticity of the mapping class group of the punctured
sphere. Using quite diﬀerent techniques from Thurston, Mosher proved au-
tomaticity of the mapping class group of any surface of ﬁnite type, that is,
the group of (orientation preserving) homeomorphisms modulo isotopy of
any surface obtained from a compact surface by removing at most ﬁnitely
many points. In the case of a surface with at least one puncture the au-
tomatic structure is explicitly deﬁned (and could be constructed), in terms
of a complex whose vertices are ideal triangulations on S (triangulations
with vertex set the puncture set) and whose edges are elementary moves
between ideal triangulations. The more general case can be reduced to the
case of a punctured surface using a short exact sequence. The question of
whether the mapping class group was in fact biautomatic was ﬁnally solved
by Hamenstaedt’s construction of a biautomatic structure in 2009 [38].

An Artin group is deﬁned to have large type if all the associated parameters
mij are at least 3, extra large type if all mij are at least 4. For large and
especially extra large groups small cancellation techniques associated with
negatively curved geometry were developed in [6]. All extra large Artin
groups were proved biautomatic in [68], using those small cancellation tech-
niques; the language is a set of geodesics over the standard generating set.
All those groups and many others of large type were found by Brady and
McCammond [11] to act appropriately on piecewise Euclidean non-positively
curved 2-complexes of types A2 or B2, and hence, by results of [34, 35] to
be biautomatic (but in this case the biautomatic structure is deﬁned over a
non-standard generating set).

All Artin groups of large type were proved to be shortlex automatic over
their standard generating sets in [44]. A rewrite system was described, which
rewrote any word to shortlex geodesic form using sequences of moves on 2-
generator substrings. The result extended beyond large type to suﬃciently
large type, where some parameters mij might take the value 2 (provided that
for any triple i, j, k, if mij = 2, then either mik = mjk = 2 or at least one of mik
and mjk is inﬁnite). Biautomatic structures for all large type Artin groups
(and in fact for the slightly large class of almost large groups) were proved to
exist in [49], where all those groups were proved to have appropriate actions
on systolic complexes. An Artin group is called almost large if for any triple

24

i, j, k it is only possible to have mij = 2 if one of mik or mjk is inﬁnite, and
for any 4-set i, j, k, l at most 2 of mij, mjk, mkl, mil can be equal to 2 unless
one of the four parameters is inﬁnite.

5.2 Coxeter groups

The proof in [16] of shortlex automaticity of any Coxeter group relative to
its standard generating set provided a result that had long been conjectured.
We recall that a Coxeter group W is described by a presentation

hx1, . . . , xn | x2

i = 1, (xixj)mij = 1, i 6= j ∈ {1, . . . , n}i,

relative to a Coxeter matrix (mij) and associated Coxeter diagram Γ; the set
X = {x1, . . . , xn} is its standard generating set.

The proof of the theorem constructs an automatic structure for W using
properties of its associated root system, which arises from the natural iso-
morphism between W and a reﬂection group W as we now describe; more
details can be found in [51]. The group W is generated by a set of reﬂec-
tions r1, . . . , rn of Rn deﬁned by ri(v) := v − 2hv, eiiei, for v ∈ Rn, where
ei : i = 1, . . . , n is a basis for Rn and h, i is the symmetric, bilinear form on
Rn deﬁned by hei, eji = − cos(π/mij). The isomorphism from W to W maps
xi to ri, and induces an action of W on Rn. The roots of W are deﬁned
to be the elements of the set Φ = W {e1, . . . , en}, which decomposes as a
disjoint union Φ+ ∪ Φ− of positive roots (vectors P λiei with all λi ≥ 0) and
their negatives.

Brink and Howlett’s proof of regularity of the set of shortlex geodesic words
in W is derived from their proof in [16] of the ﬁniteness of the set of positive
roots for W that dominate any given positive root; a positive root α is
said to dominate a second positive root β if whenever w(α) is negative, for
w ∈ W , then so is w(β). We deﬁne e∆W to be the set of positive roots that
dominate no others. Then a word acceptor WA for a shortlex automatic
structure for W can be built whose accepting states are all subsets of e∆W
[16, Proposition 3.3].

The transitions in WA are determined by the following observation from [16,
Lemma 3.1]. When w = xi1 · · · xil is a shortlex geodesic word representing
an element of W then, for xi ∈ X, the word w′ = wxi is non-geodesic if
and only if there exists j ∈ {1, . . . , l} for which ei = xil · · · xij+1(eij ).
In
the case where w′ = wxi is geodesic, that fails to be shortlex minimal if
and only if there exists j ∈ {1, . . . , l} and a generator xk ≺ xij for which
ei = xil · · · xij (ek). In that case the word xi1 · · · xij−1xkxij · · · xil is shortlex
minimal. Based on these two facts, transition on a generator xi from (the

25

state corresponding to) a subset S of e∆W is to a failure state F if ei ∈ S.
But for ei 6∈ S, transition is to the intersection with e∆W of the set

S′′ = {xi(α) | α ∈ S} ∪ {ei} ∪ {xi(ek) | xk ≺ xi}.

A similar construction to the above, described in [47], proves regularity of
the set of all geodesic words in G over S.

The question of whether all Coxeter groups are not just automatic but ac-
tually biautomatic remains open. Work of Niblo and Reeves [65] shows
that any ﬁnitely generated Coxeter group G acts properly discontinuously
by isometries on a locally ﬁnite, ﬁnite dimensional CAT(0) cube complex;
their construction is based on the root system Φ associated with G, and an
extension of the dominance relation of [16] from Φ+ to Φ. When the action
of G on the cube complex is cocompact, then biautomaticity follows, using
[64]. Cocompact actions are proved in [65] to exist whenever G is right-
angled or word hyperbolic (by [62] word hyperbolicity of G is recognisable
from the diagram Γ). It is also observed in [65] that, by [76], cocompact
actions are guaranteed whenever G contains only ﬁnitely many conjugacy
classes of subgroups isomorphic to rank 3 parabolic subgroups hxi, xj, xki
(associated with rank 3 subdiagrams Γijk of Γ) for which mij, mik, mjk are
all ﬁnite; [21] used this result to derive biautomaticity of G provided that
Γ contains no aﬃne subdiagram of rank 3 or more. Subsequently, Caprace
[20] proved biautomaticity of all relatively hyperbolic Coxeter groups using
results from [48].

The dimension of a Coxeter group is deﬁned to be the dimension of its Davis
complex, equivalently the maximal rank of any of its spherical parabolic
subgroups. It follows that a Coxeter group is 2-dimensional if none of the
rank 3 subdiagrams Γijk is spherical, equivalently if for all i, j, k, 1
+
mij
1
≤ 1. The biautomaticity of all 2-dimensional Coxeter groups is proved
mjk
in [63]. The construction of a geodesic language generalises ideas from [65],
and the result generalises an earlier result proving biautomaticity for certain
2-dimensional groups that used the results of [65].

6 Open problems

More than 30 years after the subject started there continue to be many open
problems involving automatic groups. Some of these problems date from the
beginning of the subject, and are listed in [26]. Some but not all of these
have been mentioned within this chapter.
In particular, it remains open
whether automatic groups exist that are not biautomatic (see Section 2)

26

also whether automatic groups exist that do not have soluble conjugacy
problem (see Section 2.2) , whether all soluble automatic groups must be
virtually abelian. The most recent progress on this last question was made
by the proof of Romankov [69], that a soluble biautomatic group must be
virtually abelian (see Section 2.3.1).

It is still unknown whether a non-biautomatic Coxeter group can exist (Sec-
tion 5.2), or a non-automatic Artin group (Section 5.1).

There are many open problems relating to group actions,
in particular,
whether a CAT(0) group must be automatic. The very recent construc-
tion in [56] of a 3-dimensional CAT(0) group that cannot be biautomatic
(Section 4) represents a major advance on this problem; it does not resolve
the question of automaticity. The question of whether biautomaticity or
automaticity are implied for a 2-dimensional, piecewise Euclidean CAT(0)
group remains open (but we note the recent contribution to this problem of
the main result of [63], see Section 5.2). The 2-dimensional problem is num-
ber 43 on a list of open problems within geometric group theory that was
published ten years ago in [32], and motivated a body of research, and rapid
solution of some of the problems. However, some of the problems listed in
this useful and extensive list, or in the earlier list [8], remain open.
