The research landscape in science and engineering is heavily reliant on computation and data storage. The
intensity of computation required for many research projects illustrates the importance of the availability of
high performance computing (HPC) resources and services. This paper summarizes the results of a recent
study among principal investigators that attempts to measure the impact of the cyberinfrastructure (CI)
resources allocated by the XSEDE (eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment) project to
various research activities across the United States. Critical findings from this paper include: a majority of
respondents report that the XSEDE environment is important or very important in completing their funded
work, and two-thirds of our study’s respondents developed products (e.g., datasets, websites, software, etc.)
using XSEDE-allocated resources. With nearly one-third of respondents citing the importance of XSEDE-
allocated resources in securing research funding, we estimate that respondents of this survey have secured
approximately $3.3B in research funding from various sources, as self-reported by respondents.

1 INTRODUCTION
Across the world, increasingly tight government and university budgets prompt increasingly strin-
gent requirements for scientific research funding. Similar concerns persist in private-sector research
and development organizations, which demand early evidence of viability and profitability. This is-
sue is particularly acute for higher education institutions in the United States due to ever-increasing
competition for federal research funding, coupled with financial pressures related to projected
decreases in university enrollments [4]. Helping to bridge this gap, XSEDE is an organization that
facilitates, allocates, and supports access to NSF-funded and other cyberinfrastructure, providing
researchers secure computational and data storage resources required for their research. Such
resources and services (e,g„ supercomputers, collections of data, and computational tools) aid
innovation and discovery [5].

This paper uses survey methods to ascertain the value of XSEDE to those who use its services,
focusing on the opinions of Principal Investigators (PIs) who have received a resource allocation
from September 1, 2016, to August 31, 2021. The majority of these allocations are for the use
of computing systems funded by the NSF through separate funding actions (i.e., independent of
XSEDE) to Service Providers. Some PIs also received allocations of consulting and programming
effort directly from XSEDE. Thus, the services investigated are a mix of system, software, and
application services, with a large portion of the study related to running software applications on
XSEDE-allocated resources. To better understand the relationship between success in competing
for grant awards and plans for executing the activities described in the funded proposals, the study
inquired about the use of advanced CI resources allocated by, provided by, or accessed via the
XSEDE CI environment. Therefore the content of this paper, while of general interest to PEARC
attendees, seems most closely related to the Software and Applications Track.

2 METHODS
This study was reviewed by the Indiana University (IU) Institutional Review Board prior to its
initiation and was determined to be “expedited,” meaning there was nothing sensitive in the
questions asked. All participants gave informed consent prior to taking part in the study. The
study population was identified from XSEDE allocation data and consisted of PIs who received
resource allocations during XSEDE2 program years, beginning 2016 through 2021. Only PIs with
projects classified as "Research" or "XSEDE Rapid Response" (a special allocation category for
COVID research) were included. The survey was conducted via email with personalized links.
Population members received an initial letter of invitation on January 13, 2022, followed by four
reminder messages, the last of which being on February 4, 2022. The questionnaire consisted of
7-20 questions, depending on answers to screening questions. After accounting for bounced or
undeliverable emails, the effective survey population consisted of 1595 members. Of these, 700
agreed to participate and went on to complete or partially answer questions in the survey. The
effective response rate was 44% (700 out of 1595)[3]. Such a high response rate speaks to the
importance PIs place on the value of XSEDE in their research activities.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Importance of XSEDE in securing funds and completing funded work
The importance of XSEDE is tracked using two questions: What is the level of importance of XSEDE
in 1) securing research funding and 2) completing funded work. The majority of respondents
reported that XSEDE is important or very important in securing funds and completing funded
work. Details are summarized in Fig. 1.

Further analysis shows XSEDE resources are very important for 61% (424 of 700) of respondents
in completing funded work, and for 31% (220 of 700) for securing funds. One (1) percent (6 of 700)
of respondents reported that XSEDE resources are not at all important in completing funded work,
and seven (7) percent (51 of 700) reporting XSEDE resources are not at all important for securing
funds.

Another key finding is that 63% (444 of 700) of respondents stated that the funded work could not
have been completed without the availability of XSEDE-allocated resources. Only seven percent
(49 of 700) of respondents said that they could have completed the funded work without XSEDE-
allocated resources.

In addition, XSEDE’s Extended Collaborative Support Services (ECSS), often described as expert
consulting services and a key service offering, was cited by 61% (106 of 175) of respondents who
had used the service as either important or very important in completing their funded work.

3.2 Usage analysis of XSEDE-allocated resources
XSEDE provides CI resources to support research activities in the two key areas of computational
capabilities and data storage. Our survey captured two important metrics for the projects using
XSEDE-allocated resources: 1) the percentage of computation performed on computational re-
sources, and 2) the percentage of data stored on data storage resources. These questions are aimed
at understanding the role of XSEDE-allocated resources and the individual’s research needs. Details
are summarized in Fig. 2.

Further analysis indicated that 38% (265 of 700) of respondents used XSEDE-allocated resources
for more than 75% of their project’s computational needs, and 19% (133 of 700) used XSEDE-
allocated resources for more than 75% of their project’s data storage requirements. No respondents
reported having not used XSEDE-allocated resources for their project’s computational needs; nine
percent (62 of 700) of respondents indicated they had not used any XSEDE-allocated resources for
their project’s data storage requirements. It was also reported that more than 89% (625 of 700) of
respondents used their XSEDE allocation resources before they expired.

3.3 Research products developed using XSEDE-allocated resources
Our study also collected other important non-financial metrics, including the kinds of research
products developed using XSEDE-allocated resources. More than 66% (463 of 700) of responding PIs
reported having developed products (in addition to publications) using XSEDE-allocated resources.
Figure 3 illustrates the research products developed using XSEDE-allocated resources.

Fig. 3. Percentage of respondents reporting that XSEDE was used to develop indicated products

Many responding PIs reported having developed more than one kind of product, with 45% (316
of 700) having developed datasets and 37% (259 of 700) having developed software. These results
exemplify the non-financial returns resulting from the availability of XSEDE-allocated resources.

3.4 Analysis across fields of science
The XSEDE allocations data provided individual research activities and domains for 700 respondents
representing 737 projects (multiple PIs have allocations on more than one project). This data also
had grant values that are self-reported by the researchers without the corresponding funding
source. Corresponding grant values are available for only 495 of 700 responding PIs; grant values
for the remaining 205 respondents are treated as zero dollars. Based on that data, we looked at the
distribution of resources and products developed per domain area. Engineering and Technology,
Biological Sciences, and Physical Sciences command the greatest percentages of XSEDE resources in
terms of computation and data storage and, in turn, report the greatest number of non-publication
products produced. Further investigation shows that there is no significant difference between the
distribution of products developed and resources used when compared with the distribution of
respondents across domains. Table 1 illustrates the CI usage and products developed over various
domains.

The total funding reported by the PIs was in excess of $3.3B. About $2.3B of that is related to the
63% of PIs who said they wouldn’t have been able to complete their funded work without XSEDE-
allocated resources. After linear extrapolation to the total population of 1595 XSEDE-allocated
PIs, the total funding stands in excess of $7.5B. This speaks to the impact - financial, scientific,
and otherwise - that the XSEDE project has had on the US scientific community. These grants are
further distributed across fields of science as stated in Table 2.

4 DISCUSSION
The high response rate of 44% suggests that PIs recognize the importance of the XSEDE resources
they have used. Such a rate of response for a survey that did not provide incentives for completion
is considered above average[1].

Survey outcomes suggest that XSEDE is providing a great deal of value to the work of researchers.
Over 80% of respondents said that XSEDE was important or very important in completing funded
research. This speaks to the value XSEDE provides in supporting research that is regarded as
"worthy" in peer-reviewed funding decisions made by federal agencies in particular.

Survey results are in some ways consistent with the general history of NSF-provided national
CI resources, and in some ways different. Consistent with the origins of the NSF Supercomputing
Centers program of the 1980s, survey results suggest that computation is still a more important
service than storage. There are interesting differences between the usage of XSEDE-allocated
resources found in this survey as compared to earlier analyses of usage. While Physics and Chemistry
are traditionally considered disciplines that use a great deal of NSF-provided resources, the highest
numbers of responses came from those in Engineering and Technology and Biological Sciences,
with these two disciplines accounting for almost half of our respondents. Reports of usage for the

Chityala et al.

TeraGrid, the predecessor to XSEDE, are primarily in "amount of resource used," [2] suggesting that
the relative use of XSEDE by engineering and biology researchers is higher than for the TeraGrid.
The most frequent types of products reported were datasets and software. Interestingly, almost a
third of the respondents indicated that they had developed some sort of training resource based on
(or about) the use of XSEDE. Inventions were reported as one of the outcomes for three percent of
the respondents. Patents represent a particularly valuable and potentially marketable product; one
percent of respondents indicated that a patent had resulted from their use of XSEDE.

The value of funded research supported by XSEDE is interesting and important. Over 11 years
of XSEDE the total budget is less than $300M. The total amount of grant funding that survey
respondents indicated had been supported by XSEDE was more than $3B.

5 CONCLUSION
XSEDE plays a crucial role in allocating required CI resources for many research activities across
the United States. This paper has discussed the survey on usage of XSEDE-allocated CI resources
over the 2016-2021 period, along with datasets that provide the (self-reported) grants secured by
individual research activities and the division of research as per NSF. The high response rate of 44%
speaks to the enthusiasm of PIs for describing the benefits they received from XSEDE allocations.
A large majority of respondents said XSEDE-allocated resources were important or very important
in completing their funded work. About 63% reported that they would not be able to complete their
funded research without XSEDE-allocated resources. Nearly 66% reported that they had developed
products (e.g., websites, software, datasets, etc.) using these resources, testifying to the tangible
outcomes of these resources. This implies the pivotal role of XSEDE-allocated CI resources in their
research activities.
