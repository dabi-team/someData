ABSTRACT

The ﬁrst multi-color light curve analysis of the AH Mic binary system is presented. This system has very

few past observations from the southern hemisphere. We extracted the minima times from the light curves

based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach and obtained a new ephemeris. To provide

modern photometric light curve solutions, we used the Physics of Eclipsing Binaries (Phoebe) software

package and the MCMC approach. Light curve solutions yielded a system temperature ratio of 0.950, and

we assumed a cold star-spot for the hotter star based on the O’Connell effect. This analysis reveals that

AH Mic is a W-subtype W UMa contact system with a ﬁll-out factor of 21.3% and a mass ratio of 2.32.

The absolute physical parameters of the components are estimated by using the Gaia Early Data Release

3 (EDR3) parallax method to be Mh(M⊙) = 0.702(26), Mc(M⊙) = 1.629(104), Rh(R⊙) = 0.852(21),

Rc(R⊙) = 1.240(28), Lh(L⊙) = 0.618(3) and Lc(L⊙) = 1.067(7). The orbital angular momentum of the

AH Mic binary system was found to be 51.866(35). The components’ positions of this system are plotted

in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram.

THE FIRST STUDY OF AH MIC CONTACT SYSTEM

1. INTRODUCTION

Each component of a contact binary system has its own Roche lobe, with the inner and outer critical

surfaces sharing a common envelope. These stars are generally late type F, G, or K type stars. The majority

of contact systems are solar-type dwarfs with active stellar populations, as evidenced by their asymmetric

light curves and spectral line proﬁles.

Contact binaries typically have orbital periods of less than one day, and the Zhang & Qian (2020) investi-

gation found that the lower limit of orbital period is 0.15 days. The orbital period is frequently varied over

time, due to mass transfer from one component to the other, as well as mass and angular momentum loss

from the binary system. Although, according to Latkovi´c et al. (2021) study, systems with orbital periods

of more than 0.5 days and temperatures greater than 7000 K probably have radiative envelopes and should

not be classiﬁed as W UMa-type contact binaries.

Contact binaries are debatable in terms of mass, and the lower limit of mass ratio for these systems is

presently under investigation (e.g. Yang & Qian 2015; Arbutina 2007; Li & Zhang 2006). Additionally,

since many investigations lack a spectroscopic method, determining the mass ratio is a challenging issue.

W Ursae Majoris (W UMa)-type contact systems (EW) are classiﬁed into two categories, W-type and

A-type, based on their properties. The mass ratio in A-subtype systems is often less than 0.5, showing weak

or moderate activity. In W-subtype systems the less massive component is hotter and the period changes

continuously over time (Binnendijk 1970). In comparison with the W-subtypes, A-subtype systems are

earlier spectral types with higher mass and luminosity.

The purpose of this study is to present the ﬁrst light curve analysis of the AH Mic binary system and

determine its properties. AH Mic is a binary system from the southern hemisphere with a range of apparent

magnitude of V = 12.85 − 13.45 and an orbital period of 0.3243344 days (Watson et al. 2006). In all

the available catalogs, this binary system is classiﬁed as a EW-type system. This paper is arranged as

follows: Section 2 contains information about the multi-color photometric observations from an Australian

observatory as well as a data reduction technique. Section 3 explains how to extract our times of minima,

collect minima collection times from literature, and compute a new ephemeris. The Phoebe Python code and

4

the MCMC approach were used to study the light curves of the AH Mic system, and the absolute parameters

were obtained in section 4. Section 5 has a summary and conclusion.

2. OBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION

AH Mic (RA. 21 04 57.8280, Dec. −40 33 06.084 (J2000)) was observed for six nights in August and

September 2020 with a GSO 14-inch f/8 Ritchey Chretien telescope at the Congarinni Observatory in Aus-

tralia (152◦ 52′ East and 30◦ 44′ South). The data was taken using a SBIG STT3200-ME CCD camera

(2184 × 1510 pixels, 6.8 micron square) with 2 × 2 binning and a CCD temperature of −15◦C. These obser-

vations were made using the Astrodon Johnson-Cousins BV RI standard ﬁlters. The exposure time of these

observations for BI ﬁlters is 120 seconds and for V R ﬁlters is 60 seconds. GSC 7969-723 was selected as

a comparison star and GSC 7969-1170 was chosen as a check star with an appropriate apparent magnitude

in comparison to AH Mic. The comparison star was found at R.A. 21h 04m 49.91976s (J2000), Dec. −40◦

39′ 42.8868” (J2000) with a V = 12.831 magnitude, while the check star was located at R.A. 21h 04m

50.96544s (J2000), Dec. −40◦ 37′ 18.0120” (J2000) with a V = 13.285 magnitude, based on the AAVSO

Photometric All Sky Survey DR9 (APASS9) catalog. Figure 1 shows the observed ﬁeld-of-view for AH

Mic with the comparison and the check stars.

During the observations, a total of 1417 images were acquired. The CCD image processing was done with

MaxIm DL software, which included dark, bias, and ﬂat-ﬁeld corrections (George 2000). The airmass de-

creases the ﬂux of stars when light passes through the Earth’s atmosphere. We estimated the airmass based

on observatory coordinates and the position of the star in the sky during the observations (Hiltner 1962). Fi-

nally, we used the AstroImageJ (AIJ) software to normalize all of the ground-based data (Collins et al.

2017), and apply airmass1.

1 This study’s data (after data reduction) is available in four ﬁlters as a supplement ﬁle.

each star, which is indicated by bigger rings.

3. NEW EPHEMERIS CALCULATION

We extracted the nine times of minima in the light curves which four of them are the primary minima. We

used models based on the Gaussian and Cauchy distributions to ﬁnd the times of minima and the MCMC

sampling methods to estimate the uncertainty of the values (Poro et al. 2021). The Python code for this

extraction is implemented using the PyMC3 package (Salvatier et al. 2016). All times of minimum are

expressed in the Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time (BJDT DB), and table 1 shows

all CCD times of minima with their uncertainties of AH Mic system.

O-C variations are the differences between observed mid-eclipse times (O) and their calculated values (C)

based on a reference ephemeris. An observable trend in O-C is caused by various factors and effects. Due to

the small number of minimum times and the short interval of observation (2013–2020), only a linear ﬁt can

be considered for the AH Mic system. We ﬁtted a line on all times of minima to calculate a new ephemeris

based on the MCMC approach using the emcee package in Python (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) as shown

in Figure 2.

4. PHOTOMETRIC SOLUTIONS

4.1. Light curve analysis

We utilized the latest Python version of the Phoebe software package (2.3.58) to model the light curves of

the AH Mic binary system. We employed the Phoebe along with the emcee package (Foreman-Mackey et al.

2013), with the MCMC approach for more precision in modeling, output results, and uncertainties. We

applied 32 walkers and 1000 iterations to each walker in the MCMC approach. The Phoebe and MCMC

approach then searched for the temperature ratio, orbital inclination, and mass ratio. The bolometric albedo

and gravity-darkening coefﬁcients were assumed to be gh = gc = 0.32 (Lucy 1967) and Ah = Ac = 0.5

(Ruci´nski 1969). The stellar atmosphere was modeled using the Castelli & Kurucz (2004) method, and the

limb-darkening coefﬁcients were employed as a free parameter in the Phoebe. Different methods were used

to determine the effective temperature for the hotter component as a ﬁxed parameter. (1) The temperature

of the Gaia DR22 for AH Mic system is 5381+(74)

−(51) K; (2) The result of the B − V index obtained from
this work’s light curves to be 0.73 ± 0.04 after calibration (Høg et al. 2000) and as a result we found the

effective temperature 5470+(111)

−(119) K according to Flower (1996) study; (3) The effective temperature from

the result of Poro et al. (2022) analysis of the relationship between orbital period and the primary (hotter)

temperature for contact systems is 5681+(81)

−(80) K. We chose Gaia DR2’s temperature as a ﬁxed parameter

for the hotter star. In the continuation, we performed the initial light curve analysis. Then, based on the

2 https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/

8

following equations from Kjurkchieva et al. (2018) study, we calculated the temperatures and performed the

ﬁnal photometric light curve solutions:

T1 = Tm +

c∆T
c + 1

T2 = T1 − ∆T

(2)

(3)

where ∆T is the temperature difference between the two stars, and c is l2 divided by l1.

The BV RI light curves of the AH Mic system are asymmetric in the maxima. This shows that the

O’Connell effect (O’Connell 1951) is present in this system, as MaxII is brighter than MaxI. We em-

ployed a stellar spot model during the light curve solution in all used ﬁlters, and we found that assuming a

cool star-spot model on the hotter component leads to the appropriate solutions for all BV RI light curves

(Table 2). Table 3 shows the characteristic properties of the AH Mic light curves, with the difference in

maxima in each ﬁlter displayed in the ﬁrst row. Therefore, the B ﬁlter had the highest difference between

the levels of maximum light and the depths of the minima, while the R ﬁlter had the least. This is expected

because of the induced changes in the magnetic activity.

Table 2 shows the results of the light curve analysis, whereas Figure 3 displays the observational and

theoretical light curves of our modeling. Figure 4 depicts the 3D view and geometrical structure of the AH

Mic binary system.

4.2. Absolute parameters

The Gaia EDR3 parallax method can be used to estimate the absolute parameters when only photometric

data is available. Several elements from observational and light curve analysis are used in the computations,

despite the fact that the Gaia EDR3 parallax has high accuracy for this estimation. Recent investigations

have made some corrections to the Gaia EDR3 parallax (e.g. Lindegren et al. 2021; Ren et al. 2021). The

range of these corrections appears to include the value of observational and light curve solution uncertainties

(Poro et al. 2022).

solutions and residuals are plotted, with respect to orbital phase, shifted arbitrarily in the relative ﬂux.

Therefore, in order to properly estimate the absolute parameters of the stars of AH Mic binary system,

we used the Gaia EDR3 parallax method. This is a well-known method, which is fully described in the

Poro et al. (2022) study.

Figure 4. The positions of the components of AH Mic.

To perform the estimation, we ﬁrst obtained the absolute magnitude (Mv) of the system using the max-

imum light of apparent magnitude Vmax = 12.79(5) from our observation, the star’s distance from Gaia

EDR3 d(pc) = 470.2(6.5), and the extinction coefﬁcient Av = 0.08 from the Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011)

study. Then, by using the value of lh/ltot and lc/ltot from the light curve solutions, we obtained the Mv value

of each of the component. In addition, the bolometric magnitude Mbol value of each star were obtained us-

ing BCh = −0.133 and BCc = −0.199. Furthermore the luminosity (L) values were estimated and the

radius values of each star were obtained using the temperature of the stars from the light curve solutions.

The semi-major axis of the system was also determined by utilizing a = R/r(mean) equation. According

to Kepler’s third law, the value of Mh + Mc could be estimated using the semi-major axis and the orbital

of mass ratio.

To estimate the uncertainties using mass ratio and temperature from light curve analysis, we used the

average value of uncertainties rather than the upper and lower ranges. The results of estimating the absolute

parameters for the AH Mic system are shown in Table 4.

For comparison, we calculated absolute magnitude of system using the orbital period–luminosity calibra-

5. SUMMERY AND CONCLUSION

Observations were made on the BV RI ﬁlters for the AH Mic binary system in the Southern Hemisphere.

The MCMC approach was used to extract the times of minima of our light curves, and the times of minima

were also collected from previous observations. Accordingly, we presented a new ephemeris. The ﬁrst light

THE FIRST STUDY OF AH MIC CONTACT SYSTEM

13

curve analysis of the AH Mic system was done in this work, which was performed using the latest version

of the Phoebe Python code and the MCMC approach. To estimate the system’s absolute parameters, we

used the Gaia EDR3 parallax method, and the rest of the parameters were calculated using the observational

parameters and the light curve solutions from this study.

We ﬁxed the Gaia EDR3 temperature for the hotter component at ﬁrst, and obtained the cooler component

temperature from light curve solutions. This temperature is from the combination of both stars in the system.

So, using Equation 2, we obtained the ﬁnal temperature values of each star. The temperature difference

between the two components is 276 K. According to Allen’s table (Cox 2000), these temperatures indicate

that the spectral types of the hotter and cooler components are G5 and G8 respectively.

The mass ratio is an important parameter for contact binaries and it is determined through q-search when

there is just photometric observations. The mass ratio in this study was determined using a method based

on the MCMC approach. The reliable value of mass ratio through photometric light curve analysis is still

under many investigations to approach the accuracy of this value using the spectroscopy method. How-

ever, investigations have been conducted, one of which is based on the Machine Learning methods using

the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression model and was carried out by the Poro et al. (2022) study.

According to this method, we ﬁnd the estimated range of mass ratio for AH Mic to be 0.408 to 0.572 with a

mean of 0.485, which includes our calculated mass ratio of 0.431 from the light curve solutions. It’s worth

mentioning that the q speciﬁed in the Poro et al. (2022) study is the ratio of the less massive star mass to the

more massive star mass, hence q is never more than unity.

The Orbital Angular Momentum (J0) of the AH Mic system was calculated, and its location is displayed

on the logJ0 − logM diagram (Figure 5). The value of logJ0 of AH Mic was obtained to be 51.866 ± 0.035.

The diagram shows that this system is in a contact binary systems region.

The H-R diagram depicted the evolutionary state of the components (Figure 6). The cooler star (which

is more massive) has already evolved away from the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS), and the hotter

star stays in the main sequence belt and above the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). According to the value

of the mass ratio, the ﬁll-out factor, inclination, and location of components on the H-R diagram, AH Mic

follows the general pattern of the W-type W UMa systems.
