ABSTRACT

The combination of multi-band imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope with Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer integral ﬁeld
spectroscopy, obtained at the Very Large Telescope, has recently driven remarkable progress in strong lensing (SL) modeling of
galaxy clusters. From a few tens of multiple images with photometric redshifts per cluster, a new generation of high-precision SL
models have recently been developed, by exploiting in some cases over a hundred of spectroscopically conﬁrmed multiple images
and cluster member galaxies. A further step forward is expected with James Webb Space Telescope observations of SL clusters (from
hundreds to possibly a thousand of multiple images). In this context, we present a new, state-of-the-art SL model of the galaxy cluster
MACS J0416.1−2403, utilizing 237 spectroscopically conﬁrmed multiple images, which is the largest sample of secure multiply
lensed sources utilized to date. In addition, this model incorporates stellar kinematics information of 64 cluster galaxies and the hot-
gas mass distribution of the cluster determined from Chandra X-ray observations. The observed positions of the many multiple images
are reproduced with a remarkable average accuracy of 0.43(cid:48)(cid:48). To further assess the reliability of this lens model and to highlight the
improvement over previously published models, we show the extended surface brightness reconstruction of several lensed galaxies
through a newly developed forward modeling software. The comparison with other SL models of the same cluster demonstrates that
this new model is better suited to accurately reproduce the positions, shapes and ﬂuxes of the observed multiple images. Besides a
robust characterization of the total mass distribution of the cluster, our model can provide accurate and precise magniﬁcation maps
that are key to studying the intrinsic physical properties of faint, high-redshift lensed sources. The model is made publicly available
through our newly developed Strong Lensing Online Tool (or SLOT), that through a simple graphical interface allows astronomers
(including lensing non-experts) to take full advantage of the predictive power of the model, including statistical uncertainties on
relevant quantities associated to multiply lensed sources.

1. Introduction

Strong gravitational lensing has become a powerful technique to
characterize the total mass distribution in the core of galaxy clus-
ters (see e.g., Caminha et al. 2017b; Diego et al. 2020; Sharon
et al. 2020; Pignataro et al. 2021; Jauzac et al. 2021), to discover
and study the physical properties of high-redshift galaxies (Coe
et al. 2013; Bouwens et al. 2014; Zitrin et al. 2015; Hashimoto
et al. 2018), even resolving their structures at sub-kpc scales
(Johnson et al. 2017; Dessauges-Zavadsky et al. 2017; Meštri´c
et al. 2022), and to investigate the expansion and the geometry
of the Universe (Jullo et al. 2010; Caminha et al. 2016; Grillo
et al. 2018, 2020; Caminha et al. 2022). All of these studies rely
on accurate strong lensing models, where the accuracy of the
latter critically depends on the number of spectroscopically con-
ﬁrmed multiple images (Grillo et al. 2015; Johnson & Sharon
2016; Caminha et al. 2019).

The recent surge of high-quality photometric and spectro-
scopic data on galaxy clusters has allowed for an important
progress in cluster lens models and their subsequent applica-
tions. In particular, the combination of high-resolution, panchro-
matic and deep imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope
(Hubble) with follow-up spectroscopy with the Multi-Unit Spec-
troscopic Explorer (MUSE, Bacon et al. 2012) on the Very Large
Telescope (VLT) has lead to a signiﬁcant increase of the number
of multiple images securely identiﬁed in the core of galaxy clus-
ters (see e.g., Grillo et al. 2016; Karman et al. 2017; Lagattuta
et al. 2017; Bergamini et al. 2022; Richard et al. 2021, hereafter
R21).

MACS J0416.1−2403 (hereafter M0416, see Figure 1), dis-
covered within the Massive Cluster Survey (Ebeling et al. 2001),
has been the target of several imaging programs with Hubble
such as the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hub-
ble (CLASH, Postman et al. 2012), the Hubble Frontier Fields
(HFF, Lotz et al. 2017) and the Beyond Ultra-deep Frontier
Fields And Legacy Observations (BUFFALO, Steinhardt et al.

common with the lens model by Bergamini et al. (2021). The new 55 images added to the previous ones and used to optimize the lens model
described in this work are plotted in red. A blue circle marks the galaxy optimized separately from the cluster member scaling relations (see
Section 3). Colored squares highlight the systems of multiple images analyzed using a new forward modeling approach (described in Section 4)
that provides a further validation of our lens model. The two BCGs (BCG-N and BCG-S) and a foreground galaxy at z = 0.112 are encircled in

2020). M0416 is a massive, as found from weak-lensing stud-
ies (Umetsu et al. 2014)1, and X-ray luminous (Mann & Ebeling
2012) galaxy cluster at redshift z = 0.396. The system presents a
complex and mostly bi-modal mass distribution, which is likely
the result of a pre-collisional phase (Balestra et al. 2016). In ad-
dition, its highly elongated geometry, typical of merging clus-
ters, makes M0416 a remarkably eﬃcient gravitational lens com-
pared to other cluster lenses, as illustrated by the ﬁrst strong lens-
ing analysis (Zitrin et al. 2013). Taking advantage of the CLASH
imaging data and the CLASH-VLT spectroscopic follow-up pro-

gram (Balestra et al. 2016), Grillo et al. (2015) presented a
strong lensing model of M0416 including 30 spectroscopic mul-
tiple images from 10 diﬀerent sources. Subsequent parametric
and free-form studies were carried out, combining weak and
strong lensing analyses and testing the impact of line-of-sight
mass structures (Jauzac et al. 2014; Richard et al. 2014; Jauzac
et al. 2015; Hoag et al. 2016; Chirivì et al. 2018). In particular,
Hoag et al. (2016) included spectroscopic data from the Grism
Lens-Ampliﬁed Survey from Space (GLASS, Treu et al. 2015),
resulting in 30 secure multiple images belonging to 15 distinct
sources. A high-precision strong lens model exploiting the ﬁrst

while the new images are shown in red.

MUSE observations of M0416, that lead to the identiﬁcation
of a large sample of 102 spectroscopic multiple images from
37 background sources, was then presented in Caminha et al.
(2017a). This model was improved upon with the inclusion of
the mass component associated to the hot gas (Bonamigo et al.
2017, 2018), and the kinematic measurements of a large sample
of clusters galaxies, that independently constrained the sub-halo
mass component (Bergamini et al. 2019). In Bergamini et al.
(2021, hereafter B21) we combined the analysis of the MUSE
Deep Lens Field (MDLF, see Vanzella et al. 2021) carried out in
the northeast region of the cluster, with a careful re-inspection
of the Hubble images, and identiﬁed 182 secure images from
66 diﬀerent background sources or source substructures, ∼ 80%
more multiple images compared to previous works (Caminha
et al. 2017a; Bergamini et al. 2019). Thanks to the large num-
ber of observational constraints, the B21 lens model achieved a
high level of precision and accuracy, as shown by the reproduc-
tion of the relative distances and orientations of pairs of multiply
imaged clumps, inside well resolved sources in the vicinity of
the critical lines. The typical values were less than 0.33(cid:48)(cid:48) and
5.9◦, respectively, for 90% of the image pairs.

In this work, we further exploit the Hubble multi-color imag-
ing and MUSE spectroscopy to develop a reﬁned, high-precision
strong lensing model of M0416. We have identiﬁed 55 addi-
tional spectroscopically conﬁrmed multiple images, an increase
of ∼ 30% compared to the previous catalog published in B21.
The new set of multiple images mainly consists of multiply
lensed clumps within resolved extended sources, which are par-
ticularly useful to constrain locally the position of the critical
lines (as shown in Grillo et al. 2016; Bergamini et al. 2021,
2022). The ﬁnal multiple image sample consists of 237 multi-
ple images from 88 diﬀerent background sources, spanning a
wide redshift range z = 0.94 − 6.63 (see Figure 2). Thus, this
work presents the largest set of secure multiple images ever con-
structed (see Figure 3), paving the way for a new generation of
cluster strong lensing models, with an unprecedented level of
accuracy and precision.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present
the imaging and spectroscopic data used to develop the lens
model. Section 3 describes the sample of multiple images used as
model constraints and the adopted mass parametrization. In Sec-
tion 4, we discuss the results of the mass model, and compare it
to that presented in B21. The new lens model of M0416, includ-
ing the largest set of secure multiple image to date, is then used to
reconstruct the shape and luminosity of several multiply-imaged

sources, highlighting the high precision and accuracy achieved.
The main conclusions of this work are summarized in Section 5.
Throughout this work, we adopt a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology
with Ωm = 0.3 and H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1. Using this cosmol-
ogy, a projected distance of 1(cid:48)(cid:48) corresponds to a physical scale
of 5.34 kpc at the M0416 redshift of z = 0.396. All magnitudes
are given in the AB system.

2. Data

The updated, high-precision strong lensing model for the galaxy
cluster M0416 presented in this work is based on the same obser-
vational dataset described in B21 and brieﬂy summarized here-
after:

1. Photometric data: Hubble multi-band observations were col-
lected within the CLASH survey (16 ﬁlters) and the HFF
program (7 ﬁlters).

2. Spectroscopic data: VLT/VIMOS observations provided
redshift measurements over a ∼ 20(cid:48) ﬁeld of view (see
Balestra et al. 2016). Several MUSE observations were also
performed on the cluster core. In particular, one MUSE
pointing (GTO 094.A-0115B, P.I. J. Richard) was centered
on the northeast (NE) region of M0416 (2h of exposure and
0.6(cid:48)(cid:48) seeing). A second MUSE observation (094.A0525(A),
P.I. F. E. Bauer) was pointed to the southwest region of the
cluster (11h of integration and 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48) seeing). We refer to the
work by Caminha et al. (2017a) for a comprehensive de-
scription of these MUSE observations. Finally, an ultra-deep
MUSE observation on the NE region of M0416 was per-
formed through the observational program 0100.A-0763(A)
with P.I. E. Vanzella (Vanzella et al. 2021). This is the deep-
est MUSE observation obtained on a galaxy cluster to date,
reaching an integration time of 17.1h in most of the NE ﬁeld
of M0416 with a seeing of approximately 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48).

The M0416 lens model presented in this work has been devel-
oped using the publicly available software LensTool2 (Kneib

et al. 1996; Jullo et al. 2007; Jullo & Kneib 2009). To deter-
mine the total mass distribution of a galaxy cluster, LensTool
exploits a Bayesian approach that minimizes the following χ2
function, which quantiﬁes how good is the lens model at repro-
ducing the point-like positions of the 237 observed multiple im-
ages included in the sample:

Throughout this work, we quote the optimized parameter

that the χ2 value is equal to the number of degrees of freedom
(dof = 2×[Ntot

the posterior distributions.

Other than the χ2, the most common ﬁgure of merit to quan-
tify the goodness of a lens model is the root-mean-square sep-

3.1. Multiple images

The strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster M0416 developed
in this work considers as constraints the point-like positions of
the 182 multiple images used by B21. In addition to those, 55
newly identiﬁed images are included in the catalog (see Figure 2)
and are brieﬂy discussed below.

Of the new images, 50 are identiﬁed after cross-matching
the spectroscopic catalog by R21, considering only the images
with the highest (> 1) conﬁdence quality ﬂag, with the sample
from Vanzella et al. (2021) and Meštri´c et al. (2022). Going be-
yond the analysis presented in R21, we identify multiply-lensed,
nearly point-like substructures inside most of these images that
are used as constraints in our model. The inclusion of these sub-
knots in the lens model has proven to be extremely useful to
reconstruct the ﬁne details of the cluster gravitational potential
and the positions of the critical lines (see also Grillo et al. 2016;
Bergamini et al. 2022). For all the new images, we then revisit
the redshift value provided in R21 by cross-correlating and/or re-
analyzing the MUSE spectra, extracted within customized aper-
tures following the shape of the distorted images. In particular,
we correct the redshift value of the system 202 (system 81 in the
R21 catalog), that was incorrectly quoted equal to 1.827 by R21,
instead of 2.0912 (see Table A.1).

Two of the remaining ﬁve images, with ID 211b and 211c,
were identiﬁed by Vanzella et al. (2020). In addition, we securely
associate a third counter image (205c) with the image family

205 (family 91 in R21), that was not considered by R21. The
last two new images belong to Sys16, a galaxy-galaxy strong
lensing system around the cluster galaxy identiﬁed as Gal-8785
(see Figure 1 and Section 4). A careful inspection of the multi-
ple images around this galaxy and of the lens model predictions
have allowed us to correct a few inaccurate associations (with
no impact on the overall cluster lens model) assumed in B21. As
a result, two additional images of Sys16 are included near the
galaxy Gal-8785.

3.2. Mass parameterization

LensTool implements a parametric approach to model the total
mass distribution of galaxy clusters. This means that the total
gravitational potential of M0416 is divided into the following
sum of diﬀerent components:

φtot =

Nh(cid:88)

i=1

φhalo
i

+

Ngas(cid:88)

j=1

φgas
j

+

Ng(cid:88)

k=1

φgal
k

+ φ f oreg.

(3)

The ﬁrst sum runs over the mass density proﬁles used to pa-
rameterize the cluster-scale halos of the cluster (mainly made of
dark matter), the second one describes the contribution of the hot
gas to the total cluster mass, the third one takes into account the
total mass distribution of the cluster member galaxies (the sub-
halo component), and ﬁnally, the last term is used to represent a
foreground galaxy, at z = 0.112, residing in the southern region
of M0416 (see Figure 1). In the model we are presenting, each
, φgal
mass component (φhalo
, and φ f oreg) is described by a
k
dual pseudo-isothermal elliptical mass proﬁle (dPIE, Limousin
et al. 2005; Elíasdóttir et al. 2007; Bergamini et al. 2019) that
is characterized by seven free parameters: two parameters deﬁne

for a small over-density of galaxies in the North-East region of
the cluster (around Sys4a,b in Figure 1). The same parameteri-

parameters.

Table 2. Comparison between our new lens model for M0416 and other
published models for the same cluster. Nimages is the number of multiple

(2018) found that the total hot-gas content of M0416, inferred
from the Chandra X-ray observations, can be well characterized
using four elliptical dPIE proﬁles. Since the values of the param-
eters of these proﬁles are kept ﬁxed, the hot-gas component does
not introduce any extra free parameter in the lens model.

The cluster member galaxies (φgal

j ) are modeled with sin-
gular, circular dPIE proﬁles, for which the velocity dispersion,
σgal
LT,i, and truncation radius, rgal
cut,i, values scale with that of
the galaxy luminosity, Li, according to the following relations
(which are used to sensibly reduce the number of free parame-

In these equations, the reference luminosity, Lre f , corresponds
to the BCG-N magnitude in the Hubble F160W band (mre f
=
17.02). Following B21, we ﬁx α = 0.3 and βcut = 0.6, while a
Gaussian prior with a mean value of 248 km s−1 and a standard
deviation value of 28 km s−1 is assumed on the reference veloc-
ity dispersion value, σre f
LT . All these values are inferred from the
measured inner stellar kinematics of 64 cluster member galaxies,
obtained by exploiting the high-quality MUSE data (see B21).
An uniform prior between 1(cid:48)(cid:48) and 50(cid:48)(cid:48) is assumed on the rre f
cut
value. As in B21, we model the galaxy identiﬁed as Gal-8971
with a singular dPIE proﬁle, outside of the cluster member scal-
ing relations (thus resulting in four additional free parameters).
The total mass distribution of this galaxy is mostly responsible
for the formation of a galaxy-scale strong lensing event com-
posed of four multiple images (separated by ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48)) of the same
background source at z = 3.221 (Vanzella et al. 2017).

Finally, the bright foreground galaxy, φ f oreg, located in the
southern region of the cluster (see Figure 1) is parameterized us-
ing a singular, circular dPIE proﬁle with its position ﬁxed on the
centroid of the galaxy light emission. This extra proﬁle adds two
more free parameters to the lens model.

On the top of Table 1, we summarize the ﬁxed values and
the priors assumed for the parameter values of the mass proﬁles
included in the lens model. On the bottom of the same table,
we show instead the median values and conﬁdence intervals ob-
tained from the sampling.

rections, between the observed and model-predicted positions of

the multiple images used to constrain the lens model. Of the 237
images, only four have a (cid:107)∆i(cid:107) value larger than 1(cid:48)(cid:48). One of them,
identiﬁed as 101c in the image catalog (with z = 4.2994 and
(cid:107)∆101c(cid:107) = 1.75(cid:48)(cid:48)), resides between two background galaxies, the
ﬁrst, at a projected distance of ∼ 2.5(cid:48)(cid:48) has z = 0.5377 and a total
magnitude of mF160W = 20.76, while the second one, at a pro-
jected distance of ∼ 0.8(cid:48)(cid:48), has z = 0.5660 and mF160W = 24.46.
None of these two galaxies is included in the lens model, and this
can marginally aﬀect the ∆rms value of the images in their vicin-
ity. A second image, labeled with 102c, with (cid:107)∆102c(cid:107) = 1.05(cid:48)(cid:48) and
z = 6.0644, lies in the same region of the cluster just 3.8(cid:48)(cid:48) away
from 101c. Another image, identiﬁed as 1a, with z = 3.238 and
(cid:107)∆102c(cid:107) = 1.04(cid:48)(cid:48), is located at a projected distance of 6.2(cid:48)(cid:48) from a
background spiral galaxy at z = 0.5277 not included in the lens
model. Finally, the fourth multiple image, denominated 210.4b
((cid:107)∆210.4b(cid:107) = 1.15(cid:48)(cid:48)), consists in a Lyα emitter at z = 6.149. This
image forms close (just 1.3(cid:48)(cid:48) away) to a bright cluster galaxy,
identiﬁed as Gal-7955, with mF160W = 21.29. Since the total
mass of this cluster member is approximated through the lens
model scaling relations (see Eq. 4), a deviation of its real mass
distribution from the predictions of the best-ﬁt relations could
justify the displacement of this image.

The global ∆rms value of the lens model stands at 0.43(cid:48)(cid:48);
about 80% of the multiple images have (cid:107)∆i(cid:107) < 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48), while more
than 68% of them have (cid:107)∆i(cid:107) < ∆rms = 0.43(cid:48)(cid:48).

The model we are presenting is characterized by a sample
of secure multiple images that is ∼ 30% larger than the already
large one in B21 (see Figure 3). The additional multiple images
allow us to better constrain the ﬁne details of the M0416 total
mass distribution. On the right panel of Figure 5, we compare
the total projected mass distribution obtained using the current

model with that presented by B21. To account for the statistical
errors, we consider 500 realizations of both models randomly
extracting samples of free parameter values from the LensTool
MCMC chains. The total mass map associated with each ran-
dom realization of the B21 model is then subtracted to one of
those obtained using our new model, in order to get distributions
with 500 values of total mass diﬀerence in every pixel. In the
right panel of Figure 5, we plot a map showing for each pixel the
median values of these distributions. A similar procedure is also
applied to obtain the two panels of Figure 6, where we compare
the convergence and shear maps, computed ﬁxing the ratio of the
lens-source to observer-source distances equal to 1. We note that
diﬀerently from Figure 5, we consider here distributions of nor-
malized values. These are obtained by dividing each of the 500
convergence/shear diﬀerences by the median map of the 500 re-
alizations of our new model.

Both the right panel of Figure 5 and the left panel of Fig-
ure 6 illustrate that in the core of M0416, where we observe the
multiple images that constrain the lens models, the B21 and new
models are characterized by very similar total mass distributions.
In that region, the mass diﬀerence between the two models is
mostly lower than 5%, corresponding to just a few tens of mil-
lions of solar masses for square kpc for the projected total mass
density. As a reference, we show on the left panel of Figure 5 the
total projected mass distribution of M0416 obtained from our
new best-ﬁt lens model. This small diﬀerence is also reﬂected
in the small oﬀsets visible in Figure 7, which shows the cumu-
lative total mass distributions of the cluster, from the model by
B21 and that we are presenting here, as a function of the distance
from the two BCGs. This plot highlights diﬀerences of about 5%
close to BCG centers (there are no multiple images constraining

the lens mass in those regions), decreasing to less than 1% at
distances larger than 20 kpc, where the ﬁrst multiple images are
observed. As shown in the left panel of Figure 6, slightly larger
diﬀerences, but mostly below 10%, are found between the shear
maps of the new and B21 lens models.

Even though the ∆rms value, deﬁned in Eq. 2, is a valid ﬁg-
ure of merit to quantify the overall goodness of a lens model,
this estimator is computed considering only the point-like posi-
tions of the observed and model-predicted multiple images. As
a result, lens models with comparable ∆rms values might not
necessarily be equally good at reproducing the distorted sur-
face brightness distribution of multiply lensed sources. To make
some progress on this, we present a comparison between our new
model and two previously published lens models for M0416,
with the aim of testing their ability in predicting the details of
the extended emission of ﬁve systems of multiple images. The
ﬁrst public model was presented by R21. It counts 198 spec-
troscopically conﬁrmed multiple images from 71 sources, and it
has ∆rms = 0.58(cid:48)(cid:48). The second available model was developed by
the CATS (Clusters As TelescopeS, Jauzac et al. 2014; Richard
et al. 2014; Jauzac et al. 2015) team, which is known as the v4
CATS lens model (hereafter CATS model). The latter is con-
strained by 116 multiple images from 41 sources, and it provides
∆rms = 0.67(cid:48)(cid:48). In Table 2, we summarize the main characteris-
tics of the compared lens models, while in Figure 3 we plot the
cumulative distributions of the number of multiple images, used
as constraints for the diﬀerent models, as a function of their dis-
tance from the northern BCG.

The ﬁve analyzed systems of extended multiple images are
marked with colored rectangles in Figure 1 and are selected ac-
cording to the following criteria:

constraints by all lens models we are comparing.

– The morphology of the observed extended images is suﬃ-
ciently simple to be well approximated by a single Sérsic
light model on the source plane.

– They are located in diﬀerent regions of the cluster, and they
are distributed across the whole cluster ﬁeld-of-view: one in
the North, two at the center, and two in the South.

The reconstruction of the surface brightness distribution of
the multiple images is entrusted to a novel forward modeling
code we have developed, named GravityFM. GravityFM is a
python-based software that, through a high-level interface, al-
lows for the optimization of the parameter values of light models
chosen to represent background sources from the observed, dis-
torted, and magniﬁed surface brightness distributions in a given
ﬁlter of their multiple images. In particular, GravityFM imple-

ments a Bayesian approach to minimize the residuals between
the observed and model-predicted surface brightness of the mul-
tiple images. For a detailed description of this software, we re-
fer to the reference paper by Bergamini et al. (in preparation).
By adopting the deﬂection maps of the best-ﬁt lens models we
are comparing, we use GravityFM to ﬁnd the best-ﬁt parameter
values of the Sérsic proﬁle, that we use to describe the back-
ground source, corresponding to one of the observed multiple
images of a given system. In all the cases, we assume that the
background source can be well approximated by a single Sérsic
model with an index value n = 1, while the following parameter
values are left free to vary: the coordinates, X and Y, of the cen-
ter on the source plane, the eﬀective radius Re, the axis ratio q,
the position angle θ, and the total emitted ﬂux F. The image pix-
els considered in the optimization process are encircled in green
in Figures 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. For each system, these images
are the least distorted ones and without signiﬁcant contamina-
tion from other bright sources in their vicinity. First, the selected
single image of a system is used to optimize the parameter val-
ues of the corresponding background source, then we use that
reconstructed source and GravityFM, with the deﬂection maps
obtained from each diﬀerent lens model, to predict a posteriori
the surface brightness distributions of the other counter-images.
To create the color multiple images displayed in the ﬁgures, we

perform for each system three forward modeling optimizations
using the F814W, F606W, and F435W Hubble ﬁlters. The model
predictions in each band are then combined to obtain the RGB
images.

As expected, the R21, the CATS and our new lens models
are equally good at reproducing the chosen ﬁrst images of every
system. This is not surprising since these images are located in
regions of low magniﬁcation for all lens models and, by chang-
ing the values of the free parameters of the Sérsic proﬁle of the
background sources, satisfactory ﬁts to the data are achieved. We
note that the diﬀerent lens models reconstruct sources with dif-
ferent best-ﬁt values for the parameters (i.e., centroid, ellipticity,
and intensity) of their surface brightness distribution. However,
it is not straightforward that the optimized source can also re-
produce, a-posteriori, the position, shape and ﬂux of the other ex-
tended images of each system, because their observations are not
considered during the optimization process of the corresponding
sources.

In Figure 8, we show the results for Sys4. In this case, our
lens model is the only one that is able to reproduce the correct
observed conﬁguration of the two multiple images identiﬁed as
Sys4a,b. On the contrary, the R21 and CATS models predict the
formation of several additional bright images, some of them in

the form of an extended arc, that are not observed in the Hubble
images.

Sys13, illustrated in Figure 9, is composed of three multi-
ple images, two of which (a and b) merge into an extended arc
that crosses the main cluster critical line at the source redshift
(z = 1.005). For this system, both our and the R21 models suc-
cessfully predict the observed arc conﬁguration, while in the
CATS model the arc is so faint that it is just barely visible.

In Sys16 (Figure 10), the test extended images (i.e., b, c, d,
and e) form around a cluster galaxy with mF160W = 21.48. We
note that this galaxy is included in all the lens models and its to-
tal mass parameter values are optimized within the adopted clus-
ter member scaling relations (e.g., see Eq. 4). Remarkably, only
our lens model can accurately reproduce the observed number
of multiple images and their detailed surface brightness distribu-
tions.

Finally, while all the lens models perform fairly well in re-
producing the images b and c of Sys24, as shown in Figure 11,
our model provides the best predictions for the positions and
shapes (i.e., ellipticity and orientation) of the two test images
b and c of Sys29, as visible in Figure 12.

These results further demonstrate the importance of includ-
ing the stellar kinematic information of the cluster member
galaxies to accurately constrain the sub-halo scaling relations,

following Bergamini et al. (2021). Recent comparisons between
lensing model of massive clusters, such as M0416, and state-
of-the art hydrodynamical simulations have shown a signiﬁcant
discrepancy between the observed and simulated probability of
clusters to produce galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) events
(e.g., Meneghetti et al. 2020, 2022; Ragagnin et al. 2022). This
result can be interpreted as observed cluster members being
more compact than their simulated analogs. Given its accuracy in
reproducing the observed features of the multiple images lensed
by single cluster members, this model will be used as a basis
for further, deeper studies on GGSL systems (Granata et al. in
preparation), which may provide us with an independent probe
of the compactness of the member galaxies.

5. Conclusions

We have presented our latest high-precision strong lensing
model for the galaxy cluster M0416 (z = 0.396), based on
the largest spectroscopic sample of multiple images available
to date. We have taken advantage of panchromatic Hubble ob-
servations in combination with deep, high-quality MUSE spec-
troscopic data to identify 237 multiple images, 55 more than in
B21, from 88 background sources, as well as a pure and com-
plete sample of cluster member galaxies. The multiple images

Article number, page 11 of 16

A&A proofs: manuscript no. paper

cover a redshift range between 0.94 and 6.63 and are uniformly
distributed across all the cluster ﬁeld of view. The model incor-
porates the contribution to the cluster total mass of the baryonic
hot-gas component (derived from the Chandra X-ray data in
Bonamigo et al. 2018) and includes the measured stellar veloc-
ity dispersions of 64 cluster galaxies (corresponding to approxi-
mately 30% of the total number of selected cluster members) to
accurately characterize the sub-halo total mass component of the
cluster. This new dataset makes M0416 arguably the best known
cluster lens to date.

By comparing our new results with those from previously
published models for M0416, we have found that our model out-
performs the others in terms of ability to reconstruct the observed
positions, shapes, and magniﬁcations of the multiply imaged
sources. Thus, other than to robustly characterize the total mass
distribution of the cluster down to the galaxy scale, our model
can provide accurate and precise magniﬁcation maps, that are
crucial for the study of the intrinsic physical properties of faint,
high-redshift sources magniﬁed by the lensing cluster (Meštri´c
et al. 2022). These low-luminosity sources, the progenitors of
the galaxies in the local Universe, may play an important role
in the cosmic re-ionization, making them interesting targets for
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope. Our main
results can be summarized as follows:

1. The total root-mean-square separation between the observed
and model-predicted positions of the 237 multiple images
is ∆rms = 0.43(cid:48)(cid:48). This value is very similar to the previous
value by B21, despite a ∼ 30% increase in the number of
multiple images used to constrain the model. Moreover, the
distance between the observed and predicted positions, (cid:107)∆i(cid:107),
is lower than the ∆rms value for ∼ 69% of the images.

2. The projected total mass density distribution, the cumulative
total mass proﬁle, and the convergence and the shear maps
obtained from our new model are highly consistent with
those obtained by B21. This result, in combination with
a nearly unchanged ∆rms value and a signiﬁcantly larger
sample of multiple images, demonstrates that our modeling
parameterization is well suited to robustly characterize the
total mass distribution of M0416.

3. Thanks to a novel forward modeling code developed in this
work, we have tested that our new lens model is able to faith-
fully reproduce the extended and distorted surface bright-
ness distributions of several observed multiple images. In
this context, our new high-precision model outperforms the
results of previously published lens models, based on smaller
samples of multiple images (in some cases not spectroscopi-
cally conﬁrmed) and diﬀerent modeling prescriptions for the
total mass of cluster members.

The M0416 lens model presented here will be made publicly
available with the publication of this paper through our newly
developed Strong Lensing Online Tool, a.k.a. SLOT (Bergamini
et al. 2022). With a simple graphical interface, SLOT oﬀers the
opportunity for non-lensing experts to access all the results and
to exploit the predictive power of our models for their stud-
ies, speciﬁcally those based on upcoming JWST observations of
M0416, which will reveal yet more multiple images. For exam-
ple, SLOT can quickly predict all the multiple images of a given
source, computing also associated quantities (such as positions,
magniﬁcation factors, time delays) with statistical errors ob-
tained from the model MCMC chains. Moreover, it can be used

Article number, page 12 of 16

to create maps of magniﬁcation, projected total mass, deﬂection
angle, etc. These high-level products can, for instance, be used in
combination with the forward modeling software (Bergamini et
al. in preparation) to test the accuracy of diﬀerent strong lensing
models (e.g., see Figures 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12) and to study the
intrinsic physical proprieties of the lensed background sources.

Appendix A: Multiple images

In Table A.1, we show the catalog of the 237 secure multiple im-
ages used as constraints in our new high-precision strong lensing
model of the galaxy cluster M0416. This currently represents the
largest dataset of secure multiple images used in a lens model.

Table A.1. Catalog of the spectroscopic multiple images included in the
SL modeling of M0416.

Notes.
(a) New images, with respect to B21, included in the R21 catalog as sin-
gle image families for which we identiﬁed several source substructures.
(b) New images included in the R21 catalog for which we revisited the
image positions.
(c) New images included in the R21 catalog for which we revisited the
redshift.
(d) New images not included in the R21 catalog.
(e) Images of Sys16 with corrected positions and associations with re-
spect to B21 (see Section 3.1).
