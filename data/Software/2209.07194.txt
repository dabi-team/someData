ABSTRACT

The Son-Of-XShooter (SOXS) is a single object spectrograph (UV-VIS & NIR) and acquisition camera scheduled
to be mounted on the European Southern Observatory (ESO) 3.58-m New Technology Telescope at the La Silla
Observatory. Although the underlying data reduction processes to convert raw detector data to fully-reduced
science ready data are complex and multi-stepped, we have designed the SOXS Data Reduction pipeline with
the core aims of providing end-users with a simple-to-use, well-documented command-line interface while also
allowing the pipeline to be run in a fully automated state; streaming reduced data into the ESO Science Archive
Facility (SAF) without need for human intervention. To keep up with the stream of data coming from the
instrument, there is the requirement to optimise the software to reduce each observation block of data well
within the typical observation exposure time. The pipeline is written in Python 3 and has been built with an
agile development philosophy that includes CI and adaptive planning.

Keywords: SOXS, Pipeline, Data Reduction, Spectroscopy, Imaging

1. INTRODUCTION

The SOXS (Son Of X-Shooter) instrument is a new medium resolution spectrograph (R (cid:39) 4500) capable of
simultaneously observing 350-2000nm (U- to H-band) to a limiting magnitude of R ∼ 20 (3600sec, S/N ∼ 10).
It shall be hosted at the Nasmyth focus of the New Technology Telescope (NTT) at La Silla Observatory, Chile
(see1 for an overview). This paper describes the design of the SOXS data-reduction pipeline and data-ﬂow
system. Details of each of the other SOXS subsystems can be found in a set of related.1–28

Details of the three detectors included in the SOXS instrument, that the pipeline shall receive data from, are
given in Section 2. Section 3 explains the aims and goals of the pipeline and Section 4 describes the pipeline
software architecture and development environment. Finally, Section 5 outlines the data-products to be expected
from the pipeline and the planned data-ﬂow from raw data coming oﬀ the telescope through to the data owners
collecting reduced data from the ESO SAF.

2. THE 3 SOXS DETECTORS

SOXS comprises three instruments; the UV-VIS and NIR spectrographs and an Acquisition and Imaging Camera
(AC). The instruments are to be mounted on the NTT’s Nasmyth focus rotator ﬂange. It is the role of the
SOXS data reduction pipeline to reduce the pixel data collected by each of these instruments into science-ready
data products.

2.1 The NIR Spectrograph

The SOXS NIR spectrograph is a cross-dispersed echelle, employing “4C’ (Collimator Correction of Camera
Chromatism) to image spectra in 800-2000nm wavelength range, in 15 orders, onto a 2kx2k 18 micron pixel
Teledyne H2RG TM array (see Figure 1). It will achieve a spectral resolution R (cid:39) 5000 (1 arcsec slit).

2.2 The UV-VIS Spectrograph

The UV-VIS spectrograph employs the novel design of 4 ion-etched transmission gratings in the ﬁrst order
(m = 1) to obtain spectra in the 350-850nm wavelength range (providing an overlap of 50nm with the NIR arm
for cross-calibration). The spectral band is split into four poly-chromatic channels and sent to their speciﬁc
grating.19 Unlike the NIR arm, the UV-VIS arm will include an Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC).
Each of the four dispersion orders are imaged to separate areas of the e2V CCD and aligned linearly along the
direction of the CCD columns (see Figure 2).

2.3 The Acquisition and Imaging Camera

Although the primary use of the SOXS acquisition camera is to acquire spectral targets to allow for their centring
on the slit, the camera’s 3.5(cid:48) × 3.5(cid:48) FOV and 0.205 arcsec/px scale will also allow for science-grade, multi-band
imaging. Observers will be able to select from 7 ﬁlters; the LSST u, g, r, i, z, y set and Johnson V .

detector columns.

3. DATA REDUCTION PIPELINE REMIT

The main purpose of the SOXS Data Reduction pipeline is to use SOXS calibration data (typically, but not
necessarily, collected close in time to the science data), to remove all instrument signatures from the SOXS
scientiﬁc data frames, convert this data into physical units and deliver them with their associated error bars to
the ESO SAF as Phase 3 compliant science data products, all within a timescale shorter than a typical SOXS
science exposure. The pipeline must also support the reduction of data taken in each of the available SOXS
observation modes. The primary reduced pipeline product will be a detrended, wavelength and ﬂux calibrated,
telluric corrected 1D spectrum with UV-VIS + NIR arms stitched together (see Section 5).

Although the underlying data reduction processes to convert the raw detector data to fully-reduced, ﬂux-
and wavelength-calibrated science-ready data are complex and multi-stepped, soxspipe has been designed with

raw data frame, the speciﬁc recipe to be applied to that frame and the data product(s) output by that recipe.
Horizontal lines show how those output data products are used by subsequent pipeline recipes. Time loosely

a core aim of providing end-users with an easy-to-install, simple-to-use, clear, well-documented command-line
interface while also allowing the pipeline to be run in a fully automated state; streaming reduced SOXS data
into the ESO SAF without need for human intervention. Once users have miniconda∗ or anaconda† installed on
their local machine, the pipeline can be installed via a single command and typically takes < 1 min to install.

conda create -n soxspipe python=3.8 soxspipe -c conda-forge

The static calibration ﬁles required by the pipeline are shipped alongside the code, removing the burden often

Integration, code is distributed via PyPi and Conda and documentation is written host on readthedocs.

required of pipeline users to separately download and manage these ﬁles. This has the added beneﬁt of these
ﬁles being version controlled alongside the code so the end-user will always have access to the suite of calibration
ﬁles associated with the speciﬁc version of the pipeline they have installed on their machine.

The pipeline will also generate Quality Control (QC) metrics to monitor telescope, instrument and detector

health. These metrics are to be read and presented by the SOXS health-monitoring system.27

4. PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE AND DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

Presently, the astronomical community have overwhelmingly adopted Python as their scripting language of choice
and there are a plethora of well-maintained, mature python packages to help with basic data-reduction routines,
visualisation, user-interaction and data manipulation. It was a natural choice therefore to develop the SOXS
pipeline in Python 3. We have implemented an object-orientated composition and the pipeline is designed to
be primarily driven from the command line. The concept of ‘recipes’, originally employed by ESO’s Common
Pipeline Library (CPL), has been adopted to deﬁne the modular components of the data reduction workﬂow.
These recipes can be connected together to create an end-to-end data-reduction cascade, taking as input raw
and calibration frames from the SOXS instrument and processing them all the way through to fully reduced,
calibrated, ESO Phase 3 compliant science products (see Figures 3 and 4). Recipes are named with the preﬁx
‘soxs’ followed by a succinct description of the recipe (e.g. soxs mbais for the master bias creation recipe). There
are also many reusable functions designed to be called from multiple recipes; these are referred to as ‘utilities’
in soxspipe.

The pipeline has been built with an agile development philosophy that includes adaptive planning and evo-
lutionary development. As with any software project, one of the greatest risks is knowledge loss due to a team
member leaving before project completion. To mitigate this risk we have employed pair-programming techniques
to share knowledge, both explicit and tacit, between two developers. In times of travel bans and remote working a
JupterHub server with Python-based notebooks, shared screens and video conferencing tools have been essential
to executing these techniques.

The SOXS End-to-End (E2E) simulator14 is capable of producing simulated 2D images in the SOXS format
that take into account the main optical behaviour of the system (grating dispersion, sampling, PSF, noises
and position of various resolution elements coming from full ray-tracing). By using test-driven development
throughout the development process, combined with ‘extreme’ mock data generated from the E2E simulator, we
can verify the pipeline is not only able to reduce a typical data set but also data that is far from ideal. This
extreme data helps us push the pipeline to the limits of its capabilities and allows us to defensively develop
against the edge-case scenarios the pipeline will most certainly experience at some point in production mode.
Figure 6 gives an indication of the quality of the reductions achieved by soxspipe when reducing E2E calibration
frames.

The pipeline code is open-source, hosted on Github‡ and connected to a Jenkins Continuous Integration/Con-
tinuous Deployment server via Github’s webhooks. Any new push of code to a branch on the GitHub repository
triggers a new ’build’ of the code on the CI server where all unit tests are run. If all tests pass the branch can be
merged into main development branch. If it is the main/production branch being tested, and all tests pass, then
a new dot release version of the code is automatically shipped to PyPI§ and conda-forge ready for deployment.

5. DATA PRODUCTS AND DATA FLOW

soxspipe will reduce data into a set of ﬁnal data products (see Table 1 for details) which shall meet ESO Phase
3 standards ‘out-of-the-box’. This has the beneﬁt of allowing us to build an automated workﬂow (see Figure 7)
to reduce data directly on the La Silla summit immediately after the data is acquired by the NTT and SOXS
and then stream the reduced data directly into the ESO SAF30 in Garching, Germany. Owners of the data will
then be able to access the fully-reduced data alongside the raw data within minutes of the shutter closing on
their observation. This low-latency, automatic reduction is possible thanks to the ﬁxed format of SOXS (apart
from exchangeable slit) allowing calibration frames to be prepared ahead of time before science data reductions.
The SAF then acts as both a data distribution solution and also fulﬁls the SOXS consortium’s legacy archive
requirements.

Access to the ‘open stream’ method of shipping reduced data directly to the ESO SAF will initially require
the ESO Archive Science Group to review and verify a moderately sized collection of soxspipe reduced data.
Once the quality and content of the data produced by the pipeline have met ESO Phase 3 standards we will
then be allowed to ship data products to the archive without further need of passing through a gatekeeper. The
pipeline will automatically reduce on all point-source targets above an AB magnitude of r = 19 (with the stretch
goal of r = 20). For sources below this magnitude, the pipeline will attempt to automatically reduce the data
but may require some user interaction to optimise object extraction.

6. CONCLUSIONS

The SOXS Pipeline soxspipe has been designed and written in object-orientated Python 3 using an agile
framework of development. Built with core aims of allowing for fast, automatic reduction of raw data, streaming
reduced data into the ESO SAF without need for human intervention, while also providing end-users with a
simple-to-use, well-documented command-line interface, it is our hope that the pipeline will help facilitate the
success of SOXS in the years to come.

consortium will also reduce their data on a remote machine (probably cloud-based) with a leading-edge version
of the pipeline (bottom in green). If at any point it is decided that new development of the pipeline has led
to signiﬁcantly improved data products compared to those hosted on the SAF the consortium may opt for a
complete reprocessing and replacement of the data on the SAF via a dedicated Phase 3 Data Release (orange
