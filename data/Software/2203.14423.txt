Introduction

The Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB) represents a milestone in the history of Brazilian
science. Currently, RMB is the largest and most important drag project for the development
of nuclear technology in the country, under the responsibility and coordination of the National
Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN). The main objectives of RMB and associated facilities are
the production of radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals, aiming to meet the entire national
demand of the Uniﬁed Health System (SUS) and the private network, irradiation and testing
of nuclear fuels and structural materials, and the development of scientiﬁc and technological
research using neutron beams [1, 2]. RMB will house the National Neutron Laboratory (LNN),
the unit responsible for research activities with a suite of 17 instruments that manipulate neu-
tron beams to investigate the structure of various materials [3]. Among the instruments that
make up the LNN is the high-intensity neutron diﬀractometer, called the Flautim (Schiﬀornis
virescens). Beside the high-intensity diﬀractometer Flautim, Araponga (Procnias nudicollis) will
be on thermal guide one (TG1) of LNN. Powder diﬀraction is one of the most widely used tech-
niques to study the structural and nanostructural properties of materials. The technique allows
determination of long-range structure in polycrystalline materials, short-range atomic structure
in disordered or amorphous materials, structural distortions, and any strain and crystal size
induced changes to the structure [4]. Neutron powder diﬀraction has many attractive features,
such as neutron penetrative ability, light element sensitivity, isotope dependent scattering, and
its magnetic interaction [5]. Resolution and intensity are two essential characteristics of a pow-
der diﬀraction instrument. While the resolution dictates the ability to discern the real space
features of the material, the intensity dictates how quickly one can achieve such a measurement,
and both are inversely related [6]. High intensity diﬀractometers require closer approximation
to the neutron source, and therefore should be placed as close as possible to the Reactor Face.
This is the ﬁrst constraint that we must fulﬁll in simulations. Araponga is inspired by the
Echidna instrument from the Australian Reactor OPAL-ANSTO [7]. The basic conﬁgurations
follow your model, but upgrades are necessary to meet the particularities of the RMB neutron
beam. Monte Carlo simulations are indispensable tools in the design of nuclear facilities, from
reactor cores to neutron scattering instruments. In this context, open source software McStas
has been widely used to model neutron instruments and guides [8, 9]. The objective of this work
is to simulate a simple conﬁguration for Araponga, starting from the basic Echidna conﬁgura-
tions. We determine the neutron ﬂux at the sample location to ensure optimal values for data
acquisition, and discuss how improvements can be made in order to optical components that
can optimize the diﬀraction technique. With these results, we also intend to investigate if the
conﬁguration of instruments among thermal guides, which is given in the basic RMB project,
guarantees the best performance for all of them.

2. Modeling Araponga

The linear dimensions of the neutron guides, as well as the relative distance to the Reactor Core
and the components that make up Araponga can be found in Figure 1. It is important to note
that the Araponga instrument is intended to be installed at the end of the TG1 thermal guide
[3]. However, the input ﬁle to the McStas software contains data referring to the TG2 thermal
guide. Therefore, in this work, we use this simpliﬁcation as an initial approach to designing the
instrument. This input ﬁle has been obtained through MCNP simulations performed by INVAP,
an Argentinian scientiﬁc enterprise responsible for the RMB project and construction. Currently,
the RMB scientiﬁc team is working to reach computational autonomy to obtain neutron ﬂuxes
at all guide entrances. After getting this autonomy, we can simulate every instrument in detail.
We are certain that, soon, a complete study on Araponga will be able to be carried out with the
input ﬁle referring to the TG1 thermal guide. From the results presented in this work, it will be
possible to check if the instrument conﬁgurations foreseen in the RMB project corresponds to
the ﬁnest ones considering diﬀractometer performances. In other words, we could ensure which
guide each instrument should be allocated.

Figure 1: Scheme of the guide system from the reactor core to the Araponga instrument.

In this work, we use neutron guides in the Bunker with three diﬀerent curvature values, which
were previously calculated to avoid the undesirable direct line of sight (LoS), that is, to ensure
that each neutron undergoes at least one reﬂection on the guide wall [10]. In these simulations,
the values of the curvature have been based on two diﬀerent approaches. The ﬁrst considers
the LoS of the barely curved guide, which is exclusively inside the Bunker area as shown in the
scheme of Fig. 1. In this case, the curvature that guarantees the LoS is 4410 m. On the other
hand, by considering the section of straight guide inside the in-pile portion of the system, we
obtain the curvature of 5080 m. The formal calculation of the LoS of a 42 m long curved guide
and a 3.35 m straight guide, which conducts neutron ﬂux from reactor pool to Bunker (see Fig.
1), has been done utilizing previous deduced geometrical equations [10]. In addition, the third

2

value of curvature has been determined by simply considering the average value of these two
curvatures, i.e., 4745 m. The simulation parameters of each component of the diagram in Fig. 1
are shown in Table I. As previously pointed out, the conﬁguration of Araponga has been based
on Echidna, the High-Resolution Diﬀractometer allocated at the OPAL. Simulations have been
performed considering three diﬀerent monochromators for each curvature. Results are displayed
in Table II.

3. Results and Discussion

The results of the Monte Carlo simulations can be found in Table II. We can see that the
ﬂux at the sample position has excellent intensity, compatible even with the best high-intensity
neutron diﬀraction instruments located in international nuclear facilities [6, 7]. We observed
that the maximum value was obtained for the conﬁguration R = 4410 m and d = 1.089 ˚A. We
observe that there is a tendency of curvature of 4410 m to possess higher ﬂuxes at the sample
place, which is the opposite behavior if one considers just the ﬂuxes that pass through a curved
guide. This behavior can be seen in Table III, which shows ﬂuxes of simulated cases in diﬀerent
parts of the guide system, i.e., at the Neutron Guide Hall (NGH), before and after the primary
collimator, after the primary collimator, and at the sample place. Besides, considering that each
monochromator d-spacing provides a diﬀerent selected neutron wavelength. Therefore, one can
only compare ﬂux values of the same monochromator. In this sense, it is possible to observe

that the curvature value growth imposes higher ﬂux values, except for curvature R = 5080 m
and d = 1.089 ˚A case.

Figure 2: Neutron ﬂux proﬁle just after the primary collimator for three diﬀerent curvatures.
The black continuous line stands for the curvature of 5080 m, the red dashed line for 4745 m,
and the blue dotted line for 4410 m.

From the results of Table III, we observe that the curvature of guides does not contribute
signiﬁcantly to higher ﬂuxes since values just at the NGH diﬀer about 2.5% among them, which
is in the simulation error. In this sense, the components of instruments, such as collimators,
monochromators, etc., are more important to deﬁne instrument performance than the guide
curvature itself. The diﬀerence of ﬂuxes presented by the guide curvatures can be also seen
in Figure 2, which represents the neutron ﬂux proﬁle at the NGH, just before the primary
collimator.

However, since guide curvatures determine diﬀerent wavelength neutron transport eﬃciency and
output ﬂux divergence, a direct correspondence between ﬂux values and curvature is not always
possible. From that matter, it is important to point out that ﬁne adjustments in the primary

and secondary collimators can bring optimal conditions for the diﬀraction technique. All these
aspects are also directly related to the ﬂux spectra that reach the instrument primary collimator.
In this scenario, we can see that there is a tendency for neutrons with higher wavelengths to
behave similarly when transported by a curved guide. This can be observed in Figure 2 for
neutrons with wavelengths higher than 3˚A, where three lines begin to overlap each other. So,
adjustments are more necessary for instruments that needs neutrons with lower wavelengths.

4. Conclusions

The simulation results for the neutron ﬂux at the sample site are extremely encouraging. We
started with a basic conﬁguration for the Araponga instrument, and many adjustments could be
made to optimize the neutron diﬀraction technique. The results obtained are compatible with
state-of-the-art instruments from international installations [6, 7]. Our model will receive new
attributes after the simulations for the TG1 thermal guide, where the high intensity neutron
diﬀractometer, called Flautim, will be localized [3]. The optimization problem has many vari-
ables, such as the choice of collimators and evaluation of beam divergences in curved sections.
Soon, we will present more complete discussions about the wavelength ranges for each studied
conﬁguration.
