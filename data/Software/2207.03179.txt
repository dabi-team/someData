ABSTRACT
We present an astrometric and photometric wide-Ô¨Åeld study of the Galactic open star cluster M37 (NGC 2099). The studied
Ô¨Åeld was observed with ground-based images covering a region of about four square degrees in the Sloan-like Ô¨Ålters ùë¢ùëîùëñ. We
exploited the Gaia catalogue to calibrate the geometric distortion of the large Ô¨Åeld mosaics, developing software routines that can
be also applied to other wide-Ô¨Åeld instruments. The data are used to identify the hottest white dwarf (WD) member candidates
of M37. Thanks to the Gaia EDR3 exquisite astrometry we identiÔ¨Åed seven such WD candidates, one of which, besides being a
high-probability astrometric member, is the putative central star of a planetary nebula. To our knowledge, this is a unique object
in an open cluster, and we have obtained follow-up low-resolution spectra that are used for a qualitative characterisation of this
young WD. Finally, we publicly release a three-colour atlas and a catalogue of the sources in the Ô¨Åeld of view, which represents
a complement of existing material.

1 INTRODUCTION

The vast majority of low- to intermediate-mass stars in the Galaxy end
their lives as white dwarfs (WDs). Their nature of compact objects
has served as an important test case for many areas of fundamental
physics and stellar evolution theories. WDs in open clusters (OCs)
represent a unique opportunity to study these objects in well char-
acterised environments, as OCs usually have very well determined
properties such as age, distance, metallicity and reddening.

M37, also known as NGC 2099, is a rich (with an estimated total
mass of ‚àº 1500 M(cid:12) by Piskunov et al. 2008), intermediate-age OC,
with an angular size of about 1 deg (Griggio & Bedin 2022). As
revealed by Cordoni et al. (2018), this cluster exhibits an extended
Main-Sequence (MS) Turn-OÔ¨Ä, thus its precise age is still under
debate; Mermilliod et al. (1996) gives an age of about 400-500 Myr,
compatible with the more recent estimate by Cordoni et al. (2018)
that gives an age of 550 Myr. M37 is located in the Auriga constella-
tion, at a distance of about 1.4 kpc (Kharchenko et al. 2005; Griggio
& Bedin 2022). It has been the object of several photometric studies
(e.g., Kalirai et al. 2001) as well as spectroscopic investigations (e.g.,

Pancino et al. 2010). Both photometric and spectroscopic analyses
mostly agree on the metallicity of this cluster, which is around solar
([Fe/H] = 0.02-0.08, Casamiquela et al. 2019; Netopil et al. 2016;
Heiter et al. 2014), and give a reddening estimate in the range 0.2-0.3
(e.g., Sarajedini et al. 2004; Kang et al. 2007). M37 has been long
known to host quite a large population of WD candidates, consisting
of ‚àº 50 stars that were identiÔ¨Åed via deep ùêµ- and ùëâ-band photometry
down to ùëâ = 23.5 mag (Kalirai et al. 2001) and were characterised
through optical spectroscopy (Kalirai et al. 2005). More recently,
spectroscopic follow-up have conÔ¨Årmed, rejected, or identiÔ¨Åed new
cluster members (Cummings et al. 2015), including a very massive
‚àº 1.28 M(cid:12) object (Cummings et al. 2016). The WD census of
this OC is not yet complete due to several reasons, like source
crowding, dispersal of cluster members, unresolved binarity with
MS companions; current estimates outnumber the WD candidates
by a factor of 2-4 (Kalirai et al. 2001; Richer et al. 2021). Despite
their faintness, 10-15 conÔ¨Årmed WD members have been extensively
studied for the characterisation of the initial-to-Ô¨Ånal-mass relation
(IFMR), leading to an increasingly improved understanding of mass
loss for low- to intermediate-mass stars (Ferrario et al. 2005; Catal√°n
et al. 2008; Salaris et al. 2009; Cummings et al. 2018).

imposed a grid with equatorial ICRS coordinates.

In this paper we employ observations of M37 collected at the Asi-
ago Schmidt telescope1 in the Sloan-like ùë¢ùëîùëñ Ô¨Ålters to develop and test
a procedure to calibrate the geometric distortion of the instrument,
exploiting the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3, Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2021) absolute reference system, which will be applied also to
other wide-Ô¨Åeld imager mosaics.

By using the method of astrometric cluster membership presented
in Griggio & Bedin (2022), we have identiÔ¨Åed seven new WD mem-
ber candidates that are currently at the hot end of the WD cooling
sequence, which has so far been overlooked by previous searches.
These new candidates include the likely central star of a planetary
nebula, for which we have also obtained two sets of follow-up spectra.
We analyse their physical properties and further discuss their cluster
membership.

In Sections 2 and 3 we describe the observations and the data
reduction routines. In Sections 4 and 5 we use the membership prob-
ability and the astrometric parameters to select cluster members, and
we show the colour-magnitude diagrams in the ùë¢ùëîùëñ Ô¨Ålters. The newly
identiÔ¨Åed WD member candidates and the their spectral energy dis-
tribution analysis are presented in Section 6. Section 7 describes the
catalogue that we publicly release.

2 DATA SET

The data were collected with the Schmidt 67/92 cm telescope in
Asiago (Italy) between 2020 November, 8th and 21st. The telescope is
equipped with a KAF-16803 CCD, with an active area of 4096√ó4096
pixels and a Ô¨Åeld of view (FOV) of 59 √ó 59 arcmin2, that corresponds
to a ‚àº 0.87 arcsec/px scale. We collected a mosaic of about 2√ó2 deg2,
with a ‚àº 13 arcmin overlap. All the tiles of the mosaic were dithered,
and images collected in three Ô¨Ålters, ùë¢-,ùëî-, ùëñ-Sloan, for a total of

198 images (some of which were later discarded due to poor image
quality) each with a 240 s exposure time. In addition, we collected a
set of images with a 10 s exposure time to have a better estimation
of the Ô¨Çux of very bright sources that are saturated in the 240 s data.
Table 1 summarises the observation log.

The mosaic covers an area centred on M37. A stacked image in
three-colour version is shown in Figure 1; a description on how the
stack was produced will be given in Section 3.4.

3 DATA REDUCTION

The data have been corrected via standard calibrations (bias, dark,
linearity and Ô¨Çat Ô¨Åeld). In addition, we accounted for the eÔ¨Äects of
geometric distortion on the pixels‚Äô area in diÔ¨Äerent positions of the
CCD, which result into wrong estimations of the Ô¨Çux. In particular,
for each pixel we computed a correction factor as the ratio of the
area of the distortion-corrected pixel (see 3.2) and the area of the raw
pixel (by deÔ¨Ånition equal to unity).

3.1 Preliminary photometry

The Ô¨Årst step was to perform a ‚Äúpreliminary‚Äù photometry (i.e. we
extracted only the Ô¨Çux of the brighter stars down to a magnitude
limit of ùëî (cid:39) 17), which is then used to compute the transformations
between the frames. To this extent we started by using a version of the
software by Anderson et al. (2006) adapted to the Schmidt‚Äôs images
to derive a grid of empirical point spread functions (PSFs) for each
image. To take into account the spatial variation of the PSF across
the FOV, the image is divided into 9√ó9 regions, and for each region,
a PSF is empirically computed using bright, unsaturated and isolated
stars. In this way, for each point on the image, a local empirical PSF
can be derived by the bilinear interpolation of the 4 closest PSFs.

The grid of PSFs and the image are taken as inputs from a software
(described in Anderson et al. 2006, and adapted to our detector) that
Ô¨Ånds and measures positions and Ô¨Çuxes of the sources in the image
by using the local PSF. The routine goes through several iterations
progressively Ô¨Ånding and measuring fainter sources, until it reaches
a threshold limit of 5ùúé above the sky background noise. The software
outputs a catalogue (one for each image) containing positions and
instrumental magnitudes of the stars.

3.2 Geometric distortion

To correct for Ô¨Åeld distortion, we exploited the Gaia EDR3 absolute
reference frame. We cross-referenced the stars in our preliminary
catalogues with the stars in the Gaia EDR3. We used bright, un-
saturated sources to derive a general six parameter transformation
between the reference frame of our catalogues to the Gaia reference
frame (projected onto the tangent plane of each exposure), and then

system, with the arrows showing the magnitude and direction of the distortion on each point, corresponding to a 200 √ó 200 pixels box. The arrows have been
multiplied by a factor 2500 for visualisation purposes. On the top and left panels we show a projection on the axes of the ùë• and ùë¶ components of the distortion.

we computed for each star in each catalogue the residuals between
the transformed positions and those given by Gaia. We divided the
residuals from all the catalogues in bins of 200 √ó 200 pixels, and for
each bin we calculated the mean residual in x and y. The distortion
correction routine uses this map of residuals to correct the position
of each star via a bi-linear interpolation between the four nearest grid
points. In Figure 2 we show an example of distortion map before and
after the correction, left and right, respectively. In the Ô¨Ågure we see
the CCD divided into 21 √ó 21 bins, where the arrows represent the
mean residual of each bin. Before applying the correction, in par-
ticular near the edges of the detector, the distortion goes up to 0.15
pixels, while after the correction have been applied the distortion is
less than 0.05 pixels (about 40 mas).

3.3 The master frame

The next step is to put all our images into a common reference
frame. This allows us to measure the same star in diÔ¨Äerent exposures
simultaneously, thus increasing the signal for fainter sources. The
coordinate system on the CCD lies on the plane tangent to the celestial
sphere at the central point of the FOV. Since our images have large
dithers, each of the 2 √ó 2 Ô¨Åelds lies in a signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent tangent
plane, as discussed also in Libralato et al. (2015) for a diÔ¨Äerent
detector.

In order to derive the coordinate transformations to put every
image in the same tangent plane, we took advantage of the Gaia
absolute reference frame. We started by cross-referencing the stars
in our preliminary photometry catalogues with the Gaia EDR3, after
correcting their positions for geometric distortions of the Ô¨Åeld. The
Gaia coordinates were corrected for proper motions to be reported
at the epoch of the observations, and then projected onto the tangent
plane of each exposure using the procedure described in Bedin &

Fontanive (2018). This allowed us to derive (for each frame) a global
six-parameter transformation from the (ùëã, ùëå ) reference system of the
CCD to the meta-coordinate system (ùúâ, ùúÇ) of its tangent plane.

We then applied the inverse transformation to project back on the
celestial sphere our positions, to have all our preliminary catalogues
in spherical coordinates (ùõº, ùõø). We then arbitrarily chose a point
(ùõº0, ùõø0) (the same for all the exposures) to project down again all
the catalogues onto a common reference system (that now lies in the
same tangent plane for every image): in particular we projected all
the catalogues on the tangent plane of the image SC132969 (archival
name), and then applied the inverse transformation from the (ùúâ, ùúÇ)
coordinate system of the tangent plane to the (ùëã, ùëå ) system of the
chosen catalogue.

After these steps we have all the catalogues lying in the same
plane, in physical pixel coordinates (ùëã, ùëå ), with a mean pixel scale
of 868 mas/px. For the sake of conciseness, in the following we will
call ‚Äúpreliminary catalogues‚Äù the catalogues after the transformations
to get them onto the same coordinate system.

To deÔ¨Åne the master frame we downloaded a portion of the Gaia
EDR3 catalogue centred on M37 with a radius of 1.5 deg, we re-
ported the positions of its stars to the observed epoch, we projected
it down on the same tangent plane chosen in the previous step and
we converted the meta-coordinates to pixel-coordinates by dividing
by the pixel scale. For each Ô¨Ålter (ùë¢, ùëî, ùëñ) we compiled an average
catalogue combining all the single preliminary catalogues and pro-
duced a list of the sources found in at least eight images, giving for
each source the 3ùúé-clipped averaged position and magnitude. These
averaged positions and magnitudes are then cross-referenced with
the Gaia catalogue to obtain a Ô¨Ånal list of objects with Gaia posi-
tions and ùë¢ùëîùëñ-magnitudes. This list is then used as master frame: we
compute the transformations between each preliminary catalogue to
this reference system, which are then used as input in the next step.

3.4 Second-pass photometry

The second-pass photometry is performed by the software KS2 (an
evolution of the code presented in Anderson et al. 2008a) originally
developed for HST images, modiÔ¨Åed to suit the Schmidt sensor and
data taken with large dither patterns. Below we give a brief overview
of the KS2 software, which is described in detail by Bellini et al.
(2017a) and Nardiello et al. (2018) (see also Scalco et al. 2021 for a
more recent application).

The inputs of the KS2 routine are: the images, the PSFs and the
transformations derived from the preliminary photometry to Ô¨Ånd and
measure the sources in all the exposures simultaneously. The star
Ô¨Ånding process goes through diÔ¨Äerent iterations, moving progres-
sively from the brightest to the faintest sources. The software takes
as input also a list of bright stars from the preliminary photometry
and construct weighted masks around them, which help to avoid PSF-
related artefacts. In each iteration the program Ô¨Ånds and measures
the stars which Ô¨Åt the conditions speciÔ¨Åed for that iteration, and then
subtracts them and proceeds with the next iteration.

KS2 measures, in each image, the Ô¨Çux and position of the source
using the appropriate local PSF. The star position and Ô¨Çux is deter-
mined by Ô¨Åtting the PSF to its 5√ó5 central pixels as in the preliminary
photometry, but it computes the Ô¨Ånal position ad Ô¨Çux as an average
between all the images, with the local sky value is computed from
the surrounding pixels.

Saturated stars are not measured by KS2; their position and Ô¨Çuxes
are recovered by the preliminary photometry and supplemented in
the output. To properly measure the stars that were saturated in the
240 s exposures we used the 10 s images. We performed a second-
pass photometry on the short exposures separately, with the zero point
registered on the long exposures, and we cross-referenced the sources
in the long and short catalogues. We then replaced the magnitudes
of the saturated stars in the 240 s catalogue with those measured on
the 10 s frames.

The major upgrade in the code is devoted to perform the projections
illustrated in Sec. 3.3 on the images, to make the code suited to wide-
Ô¨Åeld images taken with large dither patterns. The upgraded code
takes as input a set of additional Ô¨Åles that are needed to perform
the transformations between the local and the master frames. The
additional Ô¨Åles are:

(i) one Ô¨Åle per image containing the coeÔ¨Écients for the six param-
eters of the most general linear transformation from the local (ùëã, ùëå )
to the (ùúâ, ùúÇ) frame of the tangent plane;

(ii) one Ô¨Åle per image containing the tangent point to each frame

used for the projection on spherical coordinates;

(iii) one Ô¨Åle that contains the (ùõº0, ùõø0) point needed to project all

the frames onto the same tangent plane;

(iv) one Ô¨Åle that contains the parameters to transform the projected

positions on the (ùëã, ùëå ) frame of the chosen image.

The KS2 software also outputs an image stack per Ô¨Ålter that can be
combined for display (as in Figure 1), although they are not suitable
for extracting photometry (details on how the stack is produced are
given in Anderson et al. 2008b). As part of this work, we also made
publicly available these atlases of the astronomical scene in the three
bands ùë¢ùëîùëñ.

3.5 Input-output corrections

In extracting photometry for faint stars, the Ô¨Çux is systematically
overestimated when the central pixel of a star coincides with a lo-
cal maximum of the background noise. This is a well known eÔ¨Äect

(sometimes referred to as ‚Äústellar migration‚Äù) that needs to be cor-
rected for (see Bedin et al. 2009 for details). In order to asses the
systematic errors, we performed an artiÔ¨Åcial-star (AS) test using the
same procedure described in Anderson et al. (2008a). For each AS
we chose a random position and ùë¢ magnitude; the ùëî ‚àí ùëñ colour is
then chosen such that the star falls on the MS ridge-line (drawn by
eye). The AS is added in each exposure at the speciÔ¨Åed position,
in the form of an appropriately scaled PSF with Poisson noise. The
software routines then operate blindly, Ô¨Ånding and measuring all the
stars. Examining the output we can determine the accuracy at each
magnitude in recovering the AS. Figure 3 (top panel) shows the dif-
ference between the inserted and recovered magnitudes for ASs in
the ùëî Ô¨Ålter, as function of the instrumental magnitude.

To account for these errors we derived a correction in the following
way: we started dividing the ASs in bins of 0.5 magnitudes. We
sigma-clipped each bin (at 2ùúé) around its median to remove outliers,
and calculated the median as an estimator of the residual for that bin.
We then interpolated the points with a quadratic spline as a function
of the magnitude. We used this relation ùëöIN ‚àí ùëöOUT versus ùëö to
correct the eÔ¨Äects of the stellar migration on the magnitudes of the
stars in our catalogue. In Figure 3 (bottom panel) we show the result
of this procedure.

3.6 Photometric calibration

Our instrumental magnitudes have been transformed into the Isaac
Newton Telescope (INT) Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS; Mongui√≥
et al. 2020) photometric system, that merges the INT Photometric
Hùõº Survey (IPHAS; Drew et al. 2005) and the UV-Excess Survey
(UVEX; Groot et al. 2009). We chose the IGAPS catalogue as a
reference because, to our knowledge, it is the only one covering the
M37 FOV in our three (ùë¢, ùëî, ùëñ) Ô¨Ålters, though its pass-bands are not
exactly equal to ours. The IGAPS ùëîùëüùëñ photometry is itself uniformly
calibrated against the Pan-STARRS system (Chambers et al. 2016)
with an internal accuracy of 0.02 mag (Mongui√≥ et al. 2020). The
IGAPS ùëàRGO band is calibrated on a run-by-run basis across the
M37 region.

We calibrated our photometry by using the relation ùëöIGAPS‚àíùëöinstr
versus the colour index (ùëî ‚àí ùëñ) in our instrumental magnitudes, as
illustrated in Figure 4. To obtain this relation we cross-matched our

sources with the IGAPS catalogue. We considered the stars that
were not saturated in both our exposures and IGAPS, and we lin-
early interpolated (for ùëö = ùëñ, ùëî, ùë¢) the ùëöIGAPS ‚àí ùëöinstr versus ùëî ‚àí ùëñ
distribution. A Ô¨Årst calibration has been performed using all the
unsaturated stars in our catalogue, and after selecting the cluster
members (see next section), in order to mitigate potential system-
atic eÔ¨Äects, we further restricted the sample to M37 members only.
To transform the instrumental magnitudes we adopted the relation
ùëöcal = ùëöinstr + ùëé0 + ùëé1 √ó (ùëî ‚àí ùëñ), where ùëöcal is our Ô¨Ånal magnitude
calibrated with respect to IGAPS, and the coeÔ¨Écients are determined
via a best Ô¨Åt approach. Higher order polynomials proved to be un-
necessary.

4 SELECTION OF CLUSTER MEMBERS

The selection of member stars have been performed using the mem-
bership probabilities derived from Griggio & Bedin (2022). To select
highly-reliable cluster members we adopted the procedure that is dis-
played in Figure 5. In the top left panel, we show the membership
probability plotted against the Gaia-ùê∫ band magnitude. We applied
a by-eye cut with the idea of selecting the bulk of sources with cluster
membership at each magnitude. This cut is indicated by the dashed
red curve, and we kept only the sources below that curve. This cut
on the membership probabilities becomes less strict going towards
fainter magnitudes as the measurement errors increase and members
becomes less certain.

This sample has then been constrained on the parallax versus
magnitude plane (top right panel). We divided the data into mag-
nitude bins of 1 mag, and for each bin we calculated ùúéùúõ,ùëñ =
68.27th percentile of the residuals around cluster‚Äôs parallax ùúõ (given
by Griggio & Bedin 2022). We derived the red curves interpolating
the points ùúõ ¬± 2ùúéùúõ,ùëñ with a spline.

The last selection was performed on the proper motions versus ùê∫
plane. We applied the same procedure as for the parallax to ùúá ùõº and
ùúá ùõø to derive the red curves.

On the bottom right panel we show the spatial distribution of the

stars that are selected as M37 members.

5 SLOAN COLOUR-MAGNITUDE DIAGRAMS

We Ô¨Årst rejected sources with poor measurements, by applying a cut
in the quality of Ô¨Åt (ùëûÔ¨Åt) parameter, which is in the KS2 output for

sources. We reject the stars that fall above the red line. Top right: ùê∫ magnitude

each source. The ùëûÔ¨Åt measures how well a source is Ô¨Åtted by the
PSF; a ùëûÔ¨Åt = 1 indicates a perfect Ô¨Åt. The cuts we performed are
shown in Figure 6. In addition to these cuts, we selected the sources
that are at least 3ùúé above the sky background. The sources that
passed these selection criteria and are not saturated are Ô¨Çagged with
pho_sel_f = 1 in our catalogue, with f = ùë¢, ùëî, ùëñ. The additional
Ô¨Çag pho_sel = 1 is for stars that passed the selection in all the three
Ô¨Ålters.

selected sources in the FOV (in grey) of M37 and the cluster mem-

6 WHITE DWARF MEMBER CANDIDATES

M37 is known to host a few, faint white dwarf (WD) members, also
including a very massive object of ‚âà 1.3 M(cid:12) (Cummings et al. 2015,
2016). Given the current age of M37, the lightest WD members
that could have formed through canonical single-star evolution are
expected to have ‚âà 0.7 M(cid:12). We focused our search for WD candidates
at the hot-end of their cooling sequence that, however, for M37
corresponds to a region of the CMD where the measurement errors
of Gaia are the largest.

We restricted our search to sources with ùê∫BP > 18 and ‚àí0.5 <
ùê∫BP ‚àí ùê∫RP < 0.5 where we expect to Ô¨Ånd WDs that have just
recently formed and have both the same distance and reddening of
M37 (ùëë = 1.5 ¬± 0.1 kpc, Griggio & Bedin 2022; ùê∏ (ùêµ ‚àí ùëâ) = 0.26,
Cordoni et al. 2018). We selected from this region the stars with
proper motions and parallaxes that are compatible within 3ùúé with
those of the cluster. To conÔ¨Årm the isolated WD nature of these
objects we built a two-colour (ùë¢ ‚àí ùê∫BP, ùëî ‚àí ùê∫RP) diagram (Figure
8), in which we identify the stars that passed this selection with
an orange dot. Seven of them possess the typical blue colours of
isolated WDs. All the previously known WD members of M37 are
fainter than our Gaia-based selection (Cummings et al. 2015, 2016,
and references therein).

Their relevant Gaia data are listed in Table 2. In Figure A1 we show
the Ô¨Ånding charts for WD2‚Äì7, while that of WD1 is shown in Figure
10 (right).

6.1 Spectroscopic follow-up of WD1

We collected optical spectra of the brightest candidate, WD1, with the
Asiago Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (AFOSC) mounted
on the 1.82-m Copernico telescope operated by INAF-Osservatorio
Astronomico di Padova atop of Mount Ekar, Asiago, Italy. We used
the gr4 grating with both 2.5 and 1.69-wide slits, achieving a re-
solving power of ùëÖ = 219 and 325 at the central wavelength of gr4
for the two setups, respectively. One single exposure of 3600-s were

taken on November 10, 2021, under hazy sky conditions (slit 2.50
arcsec), while three exposures of 2700-s each were taken on January
12, 2022 under good sky conditions (slit 1.69 arcsec). The data were
reduced with an iraf (Tody 1986) based pipeline, i.e. FOSCGUI2.
The average second-epoch spectrum signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is
around 15. A Ô¨Årst look of the combined spectrum conÔ¨Årmed this star
as a hot, likely hydrogen-deÔ¨Åcient star.

We re-observed WD1 with the Device Optimized for the LOw
RESolution (DOLORES, LRS in short) that is mounted on the Tele-

metric data and extracting spectroscopy of the focal reducer type spectro-
graph/camera FOSC. It was developed by E. Cappellaro. A package descrip-
tion can be found at http://sngroup.oapd.inaf.it/foscgui.html

scopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) at the Observatorio del Roque de los
Muchachos (Canary Islands, Spain). We took three exposures of 1800
seconds each on 2022-03-03, in service mode during Director Dis-
cretionary Time (program A44DDT3). We used the low-resolution
blue grating (LR-B) with a 1-arcsec slit that enabled a dispersion
of 2.8 √Ö/pixel and a resolution of 11 √Ö at 5577 √Ö. The observations
were performed in dark time under good weather conditions and
with a seeing well below 1 arcsec. The spectrophotometric standard
Hiltner 600 was observed at the beginning of the night with the same
slit width. The data were reduced, 1D optimally extracted and wave-
length and Ô¨Çux calibrated by using standard reduction procedures
with the starlink (Currie et al. 2014), pamela (Marsh 2014), and
molly (Marsh 2019) software packages. The average LRS spectrum
of WD1 has S/N = 35 at 5500 √Ö. In Fig. 10, we show both the AFOSC
and LRS spectra, labelling the most prominent absorption features
of C iv at ‚âà 4660 and 5801‚Äì5812 √Ö and the He ii lines.

6.2 Physical parameters

In order to shed more light on the properties of the seven WD can-
didates, we performed model Ô¨Åts of their Spectral Energy Distri-
butions (SED). We collected available photometry from the Galaxy
Evolution Explorer (GALEX DR6+7; Bianchi et al. 2017), IGAPS
(Mongui√≥ et al. 2020), PanSTARRS (Chambers et al. 2016), and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR12; Alam et al. 2015). The SED
Ô¨Åtting procedure allowed us to estimate the eÔ¨Äective temperature
(ùëáeÔ¨Ä), radius, mass, and cooling age of the candidate WDs via ùúí2
minimisation of the diÔ¨Äerence among observed photometry and the
appropriate synthetic magnitudes. The latter were computed from a
grid of Koester (2010) models for hydrogen-dominated WD spectra
(DA type), which we mapped on the La Plata cooling tracks (Al-
thaus et al. 2013; Camisassa et al. 2016). We adopted the distance
of M37 and the diÔ¨Äerential reddening estimated (following the pro-
cedure described in Bellini et al. 2017b) from the cluster neighbours
of each WD candidate as external priors in the SED Ô¨Åtting routine.
The results of our SED Ô¨Åtting are shown in Fig. A2 for WD2‚ÄìWD7.
Their photometrically estimated physical parameters are listed in Ta-
ble 3. The physical parameters of WD1 that could be obtained from
the SED Ô¨Åtting routine would not be reliable, because this star is
conÔ¨Årmed not to have a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere (see next
section). A spectroscopic follow-up of the most likely candidates
(that is WD2, WD3, WD4, and WD5) remains necessary in order to
independently conÔ¨Årm their cluster membership.

Ô¨Åtting analysis.

hotter than 60,000 K. This star was also identiÔ¨Åed by Chornay &
Walton (2021) as the central star of a faint, bipolar planetary nebula
(PN) (PN G177.5+03.1; Parker et al. 2016). From Fig. 11 a diameter
ùëë = 460 arcsec can be estimated (consider ùëë = 4 √ó ùëü, with ùëü being
the radius of one lobe). Assuming furthermore a distance of 1.5 kpc
(Griggio & Bedin 2022), and an expansion velocity of 20 km/s, one
can estimate the age of the PN to be 82 kyr. Such an old PNe can be
expected for a star that has already entered the WD cooling sequence.
The relation of this PN (shown in Figure 11) with WD1 needs further
conÔ¨Årmation: additional follow-up observations are needed to better
characterise the evolutionary status and cluster membership of WD1
(that appears as a high-probability astrometric member of this cluster,
having passed the membership selection criteria), via quantitative
spectral analysis. If its physical properties and radial velocities turn
out to be also compatible with the expected parameters (a mass that
is larger than 0.7 M(cid:12), as well as a total age and mean radial velocity
like those of the other M37 members) WD1 would represent a very
rare (if not unique) central star of a planetary nebula (CSPN) that has
passed all the tests of open cluster membership (Moni Bidin et al.
2014; Fragkou et al. 2019; Bond et al. 2020).

6.2.2 WD2, WD3 and WD5

For these three stars we have estimated photometric masses that are
within 2 or 3-sigmas from the minimum allowed mass for single
star evolution of 0.7 M(cid:12). The estimated cooling ages are compatible
with the total age of M37. In addition, WD3 passed the membership
selection criteria.

6.2.1 WD1

6.2.3 WD4

The LRS spectrum of WD1 conÔ¨Årms it as a hot, hydrogen-deÔ¨Åcient
WD that appears as an intermediate object between the PG 1159
and DO classes (Werner & Herwig 2006; Reindl et al. 2014). The
spectral resolution and S/N of the spectra in hand are not suÔ¨Écient
for performing a quantitative spectral analysis, but its ùëáeÔ¨Ä is likely

This object is the most likely cluster member conÔ¨Årmed at the 1-ùúé
level, as we obtain a ùëáeÔ¨Ä = 60 800+12 100
K, a mass of 0.67¬±0.08 M(cid:12),
‚àí10800
and a cooling age of 0.8+1.0
Myr. If conÔ¨Årmed via spectroscopic
‚àí0.4
follow-up, this WD could be one of the youngest evolved members
of M37.

6.2.4 WD6 and WD7

Although they are likely very young, these two WD candidates have
photometric estimates of radii and masses that are not compatible
with their proposed membership to M37. In fact, masses lower than
0.5 M(cid:12) are indicative of He-core WDs, originated from RGB stars
with electron degenerate helium cores, that have lost their envelope
before the onset of the helium Ô¨Çash. Given the age of this cluster,
the presence of He-degenerate cores in the post-MS stars is very
unlikely (theoretical isochrones predict post-MS stars with initial
masses larger than 2.5 M(cid:12)). Therefore, we do not believe that these
two WDs can belong to M37.

7 A NEW CATALOGUE

With this paper we publicly release a catalogue of the region de-
scribed in Section 2. The catalogue contains photometry of 210 907
sources in the Sloan-like Ô¨Ålters ùë¢, ùëî and ùëñ and Gaia EDR3 pho-
tometry and astrometry for the sources that are present also in the
Gaia catalogue. The sources that are not detected by Gaia have
the column gid set to zero. The value 999 is a placeholder for
missing values (e.g., a source that has not been detected in the ùë¢
Ô¨Ålter has ùë¢ = 999). The columns of the catalogue are described

in Table 4. The catalogue and the stacked image are available at
the following url: https://web.oapd.inaf.it/bedin/files/

8 CONCLUSIONS

We reduced and analysed Schmidt images of the open cluster M37
combining our photometric catalogue with Gaia EDR3. We devel-
oped software tools to correct for the geometric distortion exploiting
the Gaia reference system in the case of data from wide-Ô¨Åeld imagers
collected with large-dithers. The set of routines that we developed
for this speciÔ¨Åc instrument will be applied also to other wide-Ô¨Åeld
imagers.

We have astrometrically and photometrically identiÔ¨Åed seven iso-
lated WDs as candidate cluster members. We obtained follow-up low
resolution spectra for one of them, conÔ¨Årming it as a hot, hydrogen-
deÔ¨Åcient (pre-) WD. This star was previously identiÔ¨Åed as the likely
central star of a faint PN (Chornay & Walton 2020). Further follow-up
spectroscopy is needed to univocally conÔ¨Årm it as one rare example
of CSPN belonging to a Galactic open cluster. By means of spec-
tral energy distribution analysis, we suggest that four out of seven
WD candidates are likely or very likely cluster members. Follow-up
spectroscopy is also needed to conÔ¨Årm their cluster membership,
