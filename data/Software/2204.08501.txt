ABSTRACT
Born-again planetary nebulae (PNe) are extremely rare cases in the evolution of solar-like stars. It is commonly accepted that their
central stars (CSPN) experienced a very late thermal pulse (VLTP), ejecting H-deÔ¨Åcient material inside the evolved H-rich PN.
Given the short duration of this event and the fast subsequent evolution of the CSPN, details of the mass ejection are unknown.
We present the Ô¨Årst morpho-kinematic model of the H-deÔ¨Åcient material surrounding a born-again PN, namely A 30. New San
Pedro M√°rtir observations with the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph were recently obtained to map the inner region of A 30
which are interpreted by means of the software shape in conjunction with HST WFC3 images. The shape morpho-kinematic
model that best reproduces the observations is composed by a disrupted disk tilted 37‚ó¶ with respect to the line of sight and a
pair of orthogonal opposite bipolar ejections. We conÔ¨Årm previous suggestions that the structures closer to the CSPN present
the highest expansion velocities, that is, the disrupted disk expands faster than the farther bipolar features. We propose that the
current physical structure and abundance discrepancy of the H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps around the CSPN of A 30 can be explained by a
common envelope phase following the VLTP event. Our proposed scenario is also compared with other known born-again PNe
(A 58, A 78, HuBi 1 and the Sakurai‚Äôs Object).

1 INTRODUCTION

The planetary nebula (PN) Abell 30 (PN A66 30 or PN G 208.5+33.2;
hereinafter A 30) is a H-deÔ¨Åcient PN that is accepted to have ex-
perience a born-again event (cid:46)900 yr ago (Fang et al. 2014). It ex-
hibits a double-shell morphology that includes an outer H-rich almost
spherical shell with a radius of ‚àº1 arcmin and an inner H-deÔ¨Åcient
cloverleaf-like structure that extends ‚àº30 arcsec from the central star
(CSPN; Jacoby 1979).

The brightest H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps are located (cid:46)10 arcsec from
the CSPN. Initial low-resolution optical images disclosed four main
structures which were labelled as knot 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Jacoby 1979),
but these have been demonstrated later to be a collection of smaller
clumps and Ô¨Ålaments through high-spatial resolution Hubble Space

Telescope (HST) images (see Borkowski et al. 1993, 1995, and Fig. 1).
In the following we will adopt the notation initially deÔ¨Åned by Reay
et al. (1983) of J1, J2, J3 and J4 for the knots, which correspond
to the structures located towards the SE, NE, NW and SW from the
CSPN of A 30, respectively. These are highlighted with green circles
in Fig. 1.

There have been several spectroscopic studies of the H-deÔ¨Åcient
clumps in A 30 which suggest that there are noticeable diÔ¨Äerences
between knots J1‚ÄìJ3 and those of J2‚ÄìJ4 (e.g., Jacoby & Ford 1983;
Guerrero & Manchado 1996). The work of Simpson et al. (2022), in
combination with results presented by Wesson et al. (2003), showed
that there are also diÔ¨Äerences in the estimates of the abundance
discrepancy factors (ADFs)1 between knots. These works showed
that the ADF for J4 is estimated to have an upper limit of 35, whilst

1 The ADF is a widely-known problem in ionized nebulae originally re-
ported by Wyse (1942) consisting in the discrepancy between the chemical
abundances derived from recombination lines and collisionally excited lines.
Typical values of the ADFs are around 2 (see Wesson et al. 2018).

that of J1 is estimated to be ‚àº700. However, it appears that without the
information of the H mass fraction in the diÔ¨Äerent clumps one cannot
make strong statements on possible abundance diÔ¨Äerences. Simpson
et al. (2022) concluded that speciÔ¨Åc 3D photoionization modelling
of A 30 is most needed in order to understand these diÔ¨Äerences.

To our knowledge, Dinerstein & Lester (1984) were the Ô¨Årst to
suggest the existence of a disk-like structure surrounding the CSPN of
A 30. This structure, unveiled by near-IR observations, was suggested
to be tracing knots J2 and J4 as later found by Borkowski et al. (1994).
Subsequently, narrow-band images of the H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps mainly,
obtained through the [O iii] 5007 √Ö Ô¨Ålter, have been used to described
them as part of a disrupted disk and a couple of bipolar ejections
(Borkowski et al. 1993; Harrington 1996).

We note that there is no detailed morpho-kinematic study of A 30
in the literature, although several kinematic studies indeed support
the expanding disk and jet structure (e.g., Reay et al. 1983; Jacoby &
Chu 1989; Chu et al. 1997; Yadoumaru & Tamura 1994). The study
presented by Meaburn & Lopez (1996) disclosed a more detailed
kinematics given the large number of spectra and the higher spectral
resolution. These authors used San Pedro M√°rtir (SPM) Manchester
Echelle Spectrograph (MES; Meaburn et al. 2003) observations to
show that the radial expansion velocity of the outer H-rich nebula
is 38.5¬±1.0 km s‚àí1, while the H-poor material exhibits a range of
velocities from ‚àº40 to a few times 100 km s‚àí1.

The mass ejection from a single star can not produce a bipolar
morphology (e.g., Garc√≠a-Segura et al. 2014). Therefore, the bipolar
structure of the H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps in A 30 (disrupted disk+jet) has
to be attributed to the action of a companion, either stellar or, as
suggested a few decades ago by Soker (1997), sub-stellar. Indeed
A 30 possesses the highest ADF among PNe, a property strongly
correlated with binarity (Wesson et al. 2018), and the brightness
variation period of 1.06 d of its CSPN in Kepler/K2 observations

has been attributed to the presence of a companion (Jacoby et al.
2020). Nevertheless, Toal√° et al. (2021) used photoionization models
including gas and dust to Ô¨Ånd that, after accounting for the C trapped
in the dust, the C/O ratio of (cid:38) 1 is consistent with a single star
experiencing a VLTP (see, e.g., Miller Bertolami et al. 2006, and
references therein).

In this paper, we present the Ô¨Årst morpho-kinematic study of the
inner H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps in A 30 to assess the details of their ejec-
tion scenario and shaping. High-resolution SPM MES spectra were
recently acquired and modelled with the use of the shape software
(SteÔ¨Äen et al. 2011).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present our
observations and data reduction. The interpretation of the high-
resolution spectra through a morpho-kinematic model is presented
in Section 3. Our results are discussed in Section 4 where we pro-
pose a shaping mechanisms of the H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps. Finally, our
conclusions are presented in Section 5.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA PREPARATION

Long-slit high-dispersion optical spectra of A 30 were obtained us-
ing the MES mounted on the 2.1m telescope at the Observatorio
Astron√≥mico Nacional at San Pedro M√°rtir (OAN-SPM, Mexico)2.
The data were obtained on 2020 January 20 and 21 (see Table 1)
using the E2V 42-40 CCD with a pixel size of 13.5 ùúám pix‚àí1 and
a 4√ó4 on chip binning, which resulted in a plate scale of 0.702 arc-
sec pix‚àí1. A series of spectra were taken with exposures of 1200 s
through the [O iii] 5007√Ö Ô¨Ålter (ŒîùúÜ=50 √Ö) to isolate the 114th order
(0.086 √Ö pix‚àí1 spectral scale). The slit width of 150 ùúám (1.9 arcsec)
leads to a spectral resolution of 12 ¬± 1 km s‚àí1.

We observed Ô¨Åve slits positions across the CSPN of A 30 along dif-
ferent position angles (PAs) to cover most of the H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps
and Ô¨Ålaments surrounding the CSPN. The slit positions are illustrated
in Fig. 1 and the journal of observations is given in Table 1.

The spectra were processed using standard calibration routines in
iraf (Tody 1993), including bias subtraction and wavelength cali-
bration with ThAr arc lamps obtained immediately before and after
the science observations. The wavelength accuracy is estimated to
be ¬±1 km s‚àí1.

The resultant position-velocity (PV) diagrams3 of the Ô¨Åve spectra
are presented in Fig. 2. These resemble PV diagrams previously pre-
sented by other authors, with an outer almost spherical shell extend-

The software shape was used to interpret the SPM MES [O iii]
spectra and HST WFC3 [O iii] image of A 30. shape allows the
user to deÔ¨Åne diÔ¨Äerent 3D geometric structures that can be edited

(truncated, rotated and stretched) in order to produce shapes that
resemble those of the direct images of the studied objects. Moreover,
expansion velocity laws can be deÔ¨Åned for the diÔ¨Äerent structures and,
subsequently, synthetic PV diagrams can be produced and compared
to those observed.

A simplistic model consistent of a toroidal structure and a pair of
spherical clumps mimicking the jet-like features was Ô¨Årst attempted.
Not surprisingly, those structures did not produce images nor PV
diagrams similar to the observed ones as the H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps and
Ô¨Ålaments in A 30 are actually composed by collections of discrete
knots. Furthermore, it was clear that the clumps and Ô¨Ålaments in the

in green, blue, and red denote the disrupted disk and the approaching and receding jet-like structures in A 30, respectively (see Section 3 for details). The bottom

so-called disrupted disk are not equidistant to the CSPN of A 30.
To improve the model, tailor-made structures were deÔ¨Åned for each
individual clump. These consisted of truncated tori, i.e., structures
with the appearance of a doughnut slice. Those corresponding to the
disrupted disk were assumed to be distributed mostly along the same
plane, that will be referred as the equatorial plane, whereas those of
the jet-like features were assumed to be mostly along the orthogonal
direction, i.e., the symmetry axis of the disrupted disk. The model
further assumes that the symmetry axis of the disrupted disk and thus
the jet-like features have a PA on the sky of ‚àí30‚ó¶, the same used for
slit 4 (see Table 1).

The shape of each individual structure and their velocities were
then Ô¨Åne-tuned until the features in the synthetic [O iii] image and
PV diagrams were satisfactorily reproduced. Each truncated torus is
deÔ¨Åned by its distance to the star, thickness, length along the radial
direction, and height over the equatorial plane. The velocity at each
point of these truncated tori is assumed to be radial and its modulus
ùë£ is proportional to its radial distance ùëü

where ùëü0 is the distance from the facing-side of the clump to the

law thus includes a velocity gradient within each clump that takes
into account the head to tail velocity diÔ¨Äerence in a cometary knot.

The best shape model of A 30 is presented in Figure 4 and the
resultant synthetic PV diagrams are presented in the bottom panels
of Figure 3 in comparison with those observed. Edge- and pole-on
projections of the best shape model are also presented in the top-
middle and top-right panels of Figure 4.

This model includes 20 more or less coplanar truncated tori around
the CSPN illustrated in green in Figure 4. These structures are located
on a plane with an average inclination angle ùëñ of 37‚ó¶ ¬± 4‚ó¶ with re-
spect to the line of sight, they have distances from the CSPN of A 30
ranging between 2.1 and 11.4 arcsec, with an averaged distance of
8.3 arcsec, and the average disk expansion velocity has a value ùëâdisk
of 105 ¬± 5 km s‚àí1, where the errors on ùëñ and ùëâdisk are derived empir-
ically solely based on the accuracy in reproducing the observed PVs
and image by the model. The model requires the brightest SW optical
knots to be slightly larger (see Fig. 4). Interestingly, the character-
istic velocity of each clump ùë£0 decreases with their distance to the
CSPN, in agreement with the results obtained by Fang et al. (2014)
based on their proper motions. These structures fairly reproduce the

Contrary to what would be expected from the kinematics of a disk
and a bipolar jet produced at the same time during a thermonuclear
explosion, our shape model indicates that the clumps in the disk-like
structure in A 30 expand faster than the jet features, while they are
three times closer to the CSPN than those. These results are in line
with those reported by Fang et al. (2014) who analyzed multi-epoch
HST WFPC2 and WFC3 images of A 30 and A 78 and showed that
the proper motions of the H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps in these two born-again
PNe are higher for those closer to the CSPN. A number of diÔ¨Äerent
physical mechanisms such as photoionization, photoevaporation, the
rocket eÔ¨Äect and momentum transfer from the current fast wind to
the dense clumps may have contributed altering the dynamics of the
H-deÔ¨Åcient ejecta and producing its complex morphology (see the
discussion section in Fang et al. 2014).

The extreme bipolar morphology of the H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps around
the CSPN of A 30 seems to concur with the possible presence of a
companion (Soker 1997; Jacoby et al. 2020), which can be invoked
to explain the modulation of the mass loss and the production of the
disk+jet system. Nevertheless, the C/O ratio obtained after taking into
account the C-rich dust in the ejecta in A 30 suggests a single-star
VLTP event (Toal√° et al. 2021). We propose that these apparently
discrepant results can be simultaneously explained by invoking a
VLTP followed by a common envelope (CE) evolution (Ivanova et
al. 2013). This scenario, illustrated in Figure 6, is detailed as follows:

a) The CSPN of A 30 evolved from a binary system comprising an
evolved WD (white dwarf) and a low-mass companion with masses
ùëÄ1 and ùëÄ2, respectively (Fig. 6-a).

b) Following stellar evolution models, the WD experienced a VLTP
causing the expansion of its outer layers and returning to the AGB
locus of the HR diagram (see, e.g., Iben et al. 1983, Fig. 6-b). These
predict a duration for the VLTP of decades to a few hundreds of years
(see, e.g., Miller Bertolami et al. 2006, and references therein).

c) The radius increase of the primary caused the system to enter a
CE phase (Fig. 6-c). The companion transferred angular momentum
to the envelope, producing a reduction of its gravitational binding
energy. CE numerical simulations predict that this process reduces
the orbital separation within time scales of months-to-years (see, e.g.,
Chamandy et al. 2020). We refer to this stage as the CE-born-again
(CEBA) phase.

d) Numerical simulations have shown that the companion (ùëÄ2) can
help shaping the mass-loss from the primary (ùëÄ1) during the CE
phase. This process might have produced a toroidal structure followed
by a subsequent bipolar ejection of material (see, e.g., Garc√≠a-Segura
et al. 2021; Zou et al. 2020; Lopez-Camara et al. 2021, and references
therein). Thus, in A 30 the bipolar shaping took place during the
duration of the VLTP. At this moment, the jet velocity ùëâjet was larger
than the disk expansion velocity ùëâdisk (Fig. 6-d). As the ejecta in the
bipolar component moved faster than the disk, it was located at larger
distances from the CSPN than the toroidal structure. This phase will
be referred as early born-again (EBA) phase.

e) A large amount of works on born-again PNe suggests that the evo-
lution of their CSPN is fast after experiencing a VLTP (see Evans et
al. 2020; Hinkle et al. 2020, and references therein). The star shrinks
and gets hotter so that a fast stellar wind and strong UV Ô¨Çux are
developed. We propose that after the EBA phase, the increased stel-
lar wind momentum and ionizing Ô¨Çux induced the toroidal structure
to experience hydrodynamical instabilities that ultimately disrupted
it into clumps and Ô¨Ålaments within a few hundred years (see the
simulations presented in Fang et al. 2014). The momentum transfer
eÔ¨Éciency from the wind to the H-deÔ¨Åcient material would be larger
for closer structures. In particular, the CSPN of A 30, which experi-

morphology and kinematics of the disrupted disk4 as illustrated in
the bottom panels of Figures 3 and 4.

Meanwhile the jet-like features are reproduced using two groups
of truncated tori, with the farthest ones along a direction orthogonal
to that of the disrupted disk. These are located ‚àº24 arcsec from
the CSPN and are illustrated in blue and red in Figure 4 for the
approaching and receding structures, respectively. As the jets are
assumed to be orthogonal to the disrupted disk, the best Ô¨Åt model
implies a deprojected expansion velocity for the jet clumps ùëâjet of
60 ¬± 5 km s‚àí1 for the SE one and 45 ¬± 5 km s‚àí1 for the NW one. The
largest expansion velocity of the SE jet is also in agreement with its
largest proper motion (Fang et al. 2014).

To further test our model, we also produced synthetic PV diagrams
along long-slits similar to those presented by Chu et al. (1997). These
were 1 arcsec wide and were oriented N-S at oÔ¨Äsets 4 arcsec East
and West of the CSPN of A 30, thus registering the SE and NW jet-
like structures (knots J1 and J3), respectively, but also the eastern and
western tips of the disrupted disk. The synthetic PV diagrams, shown
in Figure 5, exhibit very similar spatio-kinematic patterns with those
presented in Ô¨Ågure 4 of Chu et al. (1997).

4 DISCUSSION

Within the model limitations, the morpho-kinematic shape model
described above does an excellent job reproducing the observed PV
diagrams and image of A 30 (see Figs. 3 and 4). It deÔ¨Ånitely con-
Ô¨Årms that the H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps surrounding the CSPN of A 30 are
distributed on a disrupted disk and a pair of jet-like features.

4 We note that this comparison is limited by the lower spatial resolution of
the kinematic data compared to the superb HST image quality.

This Ô¨Ågure describes the CEBA scenario proposed in this work, in which a
WD experiences a VLTP and the ejection of material is shaped into a bipolar
morphology by a companion entering a CE phase. After the VLTP, the new
WD develops a strong wind and ionizing photon Ô¨Çux that imprints momentum
onto the H-deÔ¨Åcient material. The closest structure is then accelerated faster
than the bipolar structures. See Sec. 4 for details.

terminal velocity of ‚âà4000 km s‚àí1 and an eÔ¨Äective temperature of
115 kK (Guerrero et al. 2012). Accordingly, the clumps in the disk
that were closer to the CSPN were accelerated faster than the bipolar
structures, ultimately producing the current kinematic conÔ¨Åguration
where the jet velocity ùëâjet is smaller than the disk expansion ve-
locity ùëâdisk (Fig. 6-e). We will refer to this stage as late born-again
(LBA) phase and propose that A 30 can be actually placed into this
evolutionary stage.

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì9 (2022)

The proposed scenario can also help explaining the fact that the
larger and brighter clumps and Ô¨Ålaments in the disrupted disk of
A 30 have a preferential distribution towards the SW of the CSPN.
Simulations have shown that the toroidal structure formed as the
result of a CE evolution is uneven and inhomogeneous (see, for
example, Ô¨Ågure 1 in Ondratschek et al. 2022, and their associated
videos). Density enhancements appear and get diluted towards the
equator of the toroidal structure in short time-scales and are not
symmetric given the orbital motion of the companion star. Thus, it
is very likely that by the time the fast wind and the UV Ô¨Çux of the
CSPN of A 30 increased, a density enhancement existed towards the
SW.

In the proposed CEBA evolution scenario (see Fig. 6), the disk
and jet abundances would be the same and thus we suggest that the
diÔ¨Äerences in their ADFs reported by Simpson et al. (2022) should
be rather attributed to their diÔ¨Äerent physical properties. These would
produce variations in the extent of the temperature (Peimbert 1967)
and density Ô¨Çuctuations (Viegas & Clegg 1994), or in the clumping
of the H-deÔ¨Åcient material (Liu et al. 2000), which have long been
suggested to cause the ADF (see, e.g., Wesson et al. 2018, and
references therein). The IR study of A 30 presented by Toal√° et al.
(2021) indeed points to diÔ¨Äerent physical properties between the
disk and jet, with dust at temperatures of (cid:46)200 K mainly present
in the disrupted disk of A 30. Alternatively, the interaction of the
companion with the expanded star envelope during the CEBA and
EBA phases, which would feed the disk with processed material,
may result in chemical abundances diÔ¨Äerent for the jet and disk.
As concluded by Simpson et al. (2022), it is critical to assess the
speciÔ¨Åc mass fraction of H-poor and H-rich material of the diÔ¨Äerent
components of the ejecta to peer into this problem.

A detailed 2D mapping of the chemical abundances for each clump
in A 30 would resolve this issue, and appropriate high-dispersion
integral Ô¨Åeld spectroscopic data of A 30 are been currently sought. In
addition, radiation-hydrodynamic numerical simulations following
in detail the stellar evolution of stars experiencing a VLTP will be
used in the future to test our proposed CEBA scenario and to assess
the time scales on the formation of the complex structures in born-
again PNe (Rodr√≠guez-Gonz√°lez et al. in prep.).

4.1 Comparison with other born-again PNe

The proposed CEBA scenario can be used to describe the charac-
teristics of other born-again PNe. In particular, we note that A 78
shares many similarities with A 30. The morphology of the dense H-
deÔ¨Åcient clumps in A 78 also resemble a disrupted disk+jet system
and their expansion parallaxes and radial velocity patterns are very
similar to those of A 30 (e.g., Meaburn et al. 1998), as well as their
kinematic ages, (cid:46) 103 yr (Fang et al. 2014). In addition, their CSPNe
exhibit almost the same properties (see Toal√° et al. 2015). Thus, it
can be envisaged that the CEBA scenario proposed for A 30 would
also explain the properties of A 78. A detailed morpho-kinematic
model of A 78 is needed to fully conÔ¨Årm these suggestions.

The born-again PN A 58, which experienced its VLTP in 1919,
about 100 yr ago, also displays a bipolar ejection with a dense
toroidal structure almost obscuring its CSPN (Hinkle et al. 2008).
The expansion velocity of the optical ejecta has been shown to be
‚àº200 km s‚àí1 (Clayton et al. 2013), but recent ALMA observations
of the molecular component of A 58 demonstrated that the toroidal
structure expands with a velocity of 90 km s‚àí1 from the CSPN whilst
the bipolar emission has a faster velocity of 280 km s‚àí1 (Tafoya et al.
2022). Interestingly, these authors found that the molecular material
in the bipolar ejection can be traced closely to the CSPN and has

Toroidal structureM1M2VLTPCommon envelopevjet >  vdiskvjet <  vdiska)b)c)d)e)OutflowingjetShocked and photoevaporatedjetShocked and photoevaporateddiska kinematic age of (cid:46)20 yr, i.e., apparently younger than the VLTP
event. The eÔ¨Äects of the fast stellar wind and strong UV Ô¨Çux from
the CSPN of A 58 are not yet dominant as in A 30 and A 78. Thus,
under our proposed scenario, A 58 can be placed in the EBA phase
of the evolution of a VLTP ejecta (Fig. 6-d).

The youngest born-again PN, the Sakurai‚Äôs Object, experienced
its VLTP event in February 1996, about 26 yr ago. Only two years
later, in March 1998, material expanding at velocities up to ‚àí550
km s‚àí1 was revealed by a blue-shifted absorption line of He i 10830
(Eyres et al. 1999). Soon afterwards, optical observations obtained
on 2001 detected a bipolar outÔ¨Çow in the [N ii] emission lines with
two components at systemic velocities of ‚àí350 ¬± 50 and +200 ¬± 50
km s‚àí1 (Kerber et al. 2002), thus implying an average velocity close
to the 290 km s‚àí1 derived from the fundamental vibration‚Äìrotation
CO band lines around 4.7 ùúám detected by Eyres et al. (2004) in 2003.
This expansion velocity seems to have remained unchanged in the
last decade (Hinkle & Joyce 2014; Hinkle et al. 2020). Subsequent
modelling of the IR emission led Chesneau et al. (2009) to suggest the
presence of a disk-like structure seen almost edge on, obscuring the
progenitor star. Interestingly, the expansion velocity of the densest
molecular material probed by the sub-mm detection of the HCN
molecule is (cid:38)100 km s‚àí1 (Tafoya et al. 2017). If we assume that the
densest molecular material is associated with the toroidal structure,
its expansion velocity would be several times smaller than that of
the bipolar outÔ¨Çow. This would place Sakurai‚Äôs Object in the EBA
phase, where the bipolar ejection is still faster than the disk-like
structure. Our team has gathered ALMA data to map the molecular
and continuum emission of Sakurai‚Äôs Object to probe the extreme
bipolar morphology of this born-again PN (Tafoya et al. in prep.).

The last addition to the born-again PN class is HuBi 1 (Guerrero
et al. 2018; Montoro-Molina et al. 2022). The 2D spatio-kinematic
properties of its H-poor ejecta have been interpreted as a prolate
ellipsoidal shell (Rechy-Garc√≠a et al. 2020), although the extremely
bright emission around the systemic velocity and weakness of the
fastest components suggests an alternative physical model consistent
of a bright equatorial disk mostly on the plane of the sky and a
bipolar outÔ¨Çow tilted with the line of sight. The similarity between
the expansion velocity of the disk on the plane of the sky5 of 290
km s‚àí1 and that of the bipolar outÔ¨Çows of 250 km s‚àí1 (Rechy-Garc√≠a
et al. 2020) suggests that HuBi 1 would be in the transition between
the EBA and LBA phases. Indeed HuBi 1 experienced its VLTP about
200 yrs ago (Rechy-Garc√≠a et al. 2020) and thus it has an intermediate
age between A 58 and the more evolved A 30 and A 78.

4.2 Model caveats

The proposed morpho-kinematic model and CEBA scenario provide
a reasonable description of the morphology and spatio-kinematics of
A 30 and its formation and evolution. Still we would like to mention
a few caveats.

The availability of a throughout investigation of the proper motion
of the knots of A 30 using multi-epoch HST WFPC2 and WFC3
images (Fang et al. 2014) allows investigating their tangential velocity
and thus their inclination in conjunction with the observed radial
velocities. Unfortunately, the knots of the disrupted disk are not well
resolved in our morpho-kinematic data and they cannot be assigned to
the corresponding knot resolved in the HST images. This investigation
is still viable for the polar knots. The proper motions of NW (J3) and
SE (J1) clumps is reported to be 7.93 and 6.99 mas yr‚àí1, respectively.

5 We note that this value depends on the rather uncertain distance to HuBi 1.

Shaping the H-deÔ¨Åcient ejecta of A30

7

At the updated distance to A 30 of 2.08¬±0.14 kpc (Bailer-Jones et al.
2021), this implies tangential velocities of 69 km s‚àí1 for the NW jet
(J3) and 78 km s‚àí1 for the SE jet (J1). The observed averaged systemic
radial velocities of these jets are ‚àí15 ¬± 5 km s‚àí1 and +21 ¬± 5 km s‚àí1,
respectively, where the error is introduced to account for their velocity
gradient in the PV maps. The tangential and radial velocities imply
expansion velocities and inclinations with the plane of the sky of 71¬±
2 km s‚àí1 and 12‚ó¶¬±4‚ó¶ for the NW jet, and 81 ¬± 2 km s‚àí1 and 15‚ó¶¬±4‚ó¶
for the SE jet. These results indicate that the SE jet moves faster than
the NW jet, as in the morpho-kinematic model presented Section 3,
but, unlike in the model, the polar outÔ¨Çows are not orthogonal to the
disrupted disk, which would require an inclination of 37‚ó¶. This is
not a major issue, as the inclination of the polar outÔ¨Çow in the model
is an independent parameter that can be Ô¨Åne-tuned together with the
expansion velocity of the outÔ¨Çow. Interestingly, the bipolar ejection
in Sakurai‚Äôs Object is neither orthogonal to its equatorial disk (see
Ô¨Ågure 2 in Hinkle et al. 2020). We note that the Ô¨Åeld of study of
jet evolution and eÔ¨Äects during the CE phase is very active, with
simulations showing deviations from a linear motion and choking
eÔ¨Äects in jets (see, e.g., Zou et al. 2022, and references therein) that
are not taken into account in the proposed CEBA scenario.

The comparison of the diÔ¨Äerent born-again PNe in the previous
section has evidenced that the H-poor ejecta in all of them can be
interpreted as the combination of a disk and a jet. Their expansion
velocities, however, are very diÔ¨Äerent from one born-again PN to
another. The disks and jets of A 30 and A 78 exhibit much lower
expansion velocities than those of the Sakurai‚Äôs Object, A 58 and
HuBi 1, event though the current fast stellar wind from their CSPNe
are imprinting momentum to the H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps. It shall be
noticed that, in the CEBA scenario, the bipolar ejection is produced
by the presence of a companion. At early times, the velocity of the
bipolar ejection is more or less the escape velocity

associated to the companion producing the jet, whereas the expansion
velocity of the disk would depend both on the mass of the companion
and its Ô¨Ånal orbital radius. There are no estimations of the mass and/or
spectral types of the companions of the CSPN of born-again PNe,
neither of their orbital radii, but it can be easily envisaged that a
variety of those can produce very diÔ¨Äerent initial values of the disk
and jet velocities in born-again PNe that would explain the large
diÔ¨Äerence of observed expansion velocities. On the other hand, the
released energy of the VLTP might not be the same for all born-again
PNe, but we note that this idea seems more diÔ¨Écult to assess without
modern stellar evolutionary models.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We presented the Ô¨Årst morpho-kinematic model of the H-deÔ¨Åcient
ejecta in a born-again PN, namely A 30. We obtained SPM MES
long-slit high-dispersion observations in the emission line of [O iii]
of the central H-deÔ¨Åcient clumps that mapped the so-called disrupted
disk and jets surrounding the CSPN of A 30. The observations were
interpreted in conjunction with an HST WFC3 [O iii] image of A 30
by means of the software shape, which allowed us to produce a 3D
model of the spatial distribution of the H-deÔ¨Åcient ejecta and their
expansion velocities.

Our best shape model is able to explain the features unveiled by
the [O iii] PV diagrams and direct image. To reproduce the spatio-
kinematic signatures of the disrupted disk-like structure in A 30, our

model requires the presence of a collection of clumps located mostly
on a plane tilted by 37‚ó¶ ¬± 4‚ó¶ with respect to the line of sight with
averaged distance of 8.3 arcsec from the CSPN and a deprojected
expansion velocity ùëâdisk of 105 ¬± 5 km s‚àí1. The jet-like features are
modelled by a pair of groups of clumps aligned mostly orthogonally
with the disrupted disk. These expand with velocities ùëâjet of 45 ¬± 5
km s‚àí1 for the approaching NW component and 60 ¬± 5 km s‚àí1 for
the receding SE one. The combination of the tangential and radial
velocities of these jet components provides expansion velocities and
inclinations with the plane of the sky of 71 ¬± 2 km s‚àí1 and 12‚ó¶¬±4‚ó¶
for the NW jet, and 81 ¬± 2 km s‚àí1 and 15‚ó¶¬±4‚ó¶ for the SE jet.
This would imply that the bipolar outÔ¨Çow is not orthogonal to the
disk, but this assumption on the morpho-kinematic model can be
relieved just adopting expansion velocities and inclinations similar
to those reported above. Together with the reports on the larger
proper motions of the clumps located closer to the CSPN (Fang et al.
2014), the results above suggest that the jets and the disrupted disk
in A 30 are apparently not coeval. Actually, they rather imply that
their kinematics have been strongly aÔ¨Äected by dynamical processes,
which can be dominated by their photoevaporation and the transfer
of momentum of the stellar wind.

We propose that the jets of A 30 have been produced during a
CE phase between its CSPN and a companion. When the CSPN of
A 30 experienced the VLTP, it might have inÔ¨Çated its outer layers
causing a CE phase. The subsequent fast evolution of the CSPN of
A 30 after the born-again event produced the current high ionization
photon Ô¨Çux and fast stellar wind, which aÔ¨Äects more strongly to the
structure close to the CSPN, i.e, the disk. We suggest that whereas the
kinematic properties of the jet-like features are currently similar to
those during the CE phase, the clumps in the disk have experienced
a strong acceleration caused by the fast stellar wind.

We propose that other born-again PNe can also be explained by the
proposed CEBA scenario presented here. In particular, we suggest
that A 30 and A 78 are at the same late stage of evolution, when
wind momentum is eÔ¨Éciently transferred to the clumps in the disk
and ùë£jet < ùë£disk. The younger born-again PNe A 58 and Sakurai‚Äôs
Object are arguably at a previous stage, when their CSPNe have
not developed a strong stellar wind nor a strong UV Ô¨Çux to imprint
momentum into the H-deÔ¨Åcient material so that ùë£jet > ùë£disk. HuBi 1
would be in the transition between these two phases, with ùë£jet (cid:39) ùë£disk.
Future 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations following in detail
the evolution of born-again scenarios in combination with a CE phase
are needed to test the predictions presented here. High-dispersion
integral Ô¨Åeld spectroscopic observations of A 30 and A 78 are sought
to produce a 2D map of the ADF and C/O abundances among the
diÔ¨Äerent components of the H-poor ejecta. The availability of the
proper motions of the clumps in these two born-again PNe on the
plane of the sky (Fang et al. 2014) provides the unique opportunity to
determine the inclination with the line of sight and true space velocity
of each knot without any geometrical assumption to produce the Ô¨Årst
completely unbiased 3D model of the ejecta of born-again PNe.
