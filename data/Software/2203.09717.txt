ABSTRACT
Wireless links are increasingly used to deliver critical services,
while intentional interference (jamming) remains a very serious
threat to such services. In this paper, we are concerned with the
design and evaluation of a universal anti-jamming building block,
that is agnostic to the specifics of the communication link and can
therefore be combined with existing technologies. We believe that
such a block should not require explicit probes, sounding, training
sequences, channel estimation, or even the cooperation of the trans-
mitter. To meet these requirements, we propose an approach that
relies on advances in Machine Learning, and the promises of neural
accelerators and software defined radios. We identify and address
multiple challenges, resulting in a convolutional neural network
architecture and models for a multi-antenna system to infer the
existence of interference, the number of interfering emissions and
their respective phases. This information is continuously fed into
an algorithm that cancels the interfering signal. We develop a two-
antenna prototype system and evaluate our jamming cancellation
approach in various environment settings and modulation schemes
using Software Defined Radio platforms. We demonstrate that the
receiving node equipped with our approach can detect a jammer
with over 99% of accuracy and achieve a Bit Error Rate (BER) as
low as 10−6 even when the jammer power is nearly two orders of
magnitude (18 dB) higher than the legitimate signal, and without
requiring modifications to the link modulation. In non-adversarial
settings, our approach can have other advantages such as detecting
and mitigating collisions.

1 INTRODUCTION
The mobile revolution is today a reality beyond its pioneers’ dreams.
This is, to a significant extent, due to the progress achieved by
wireless communications systems, from increased throughput, to
incredible reductions in size and power consumption. The massive
integration of wireless in everyday devices, is not only a conve-
nience, it profoundly changed how a variety of systems are designed
and operated. Beyond the deluge of IoT devices, connected through
wireless links (e.g., smart-homes and wearables), we are experi-
encing a disappearance of wired links. A plethora of older critical
Cyber-Physical System are transitioning to wireless connectivity
such as the use of Wireless Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) in the
monitoring and control of SCADA systems including the electricity
grid and industrial processes. Even aircraft and aerospace systems
cannot resist the benefits of wireless connectivity [37]. Furthermore,
emerging CPS technologies such as self-driving cars significantly
rely on a multitude of wireless links for their operations. In the
last decade, wireless connectivity also underlied notable events

for society around the world, from the Arab Spring, to supporting
police accountability.

Jamming remains one of the most serious threats to wireless
communications. Wireless links typically require a Signal to Noise
Ratio (SNR) in the order of 20 dB to meet the throughput require-
ments of most systems. On the other hand, jammers do not require
sophisticated RF Front-Ends design and basic jamming hardware
against Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and GPS devices is a commod-
ity that can be found on the Internet for a few dozens of dollars.
Due to a series of incidents, the FCC routinely releases customer
advisories cautioning against the import and use of jamming de-
vices [8], stepped up its education and enforcement effort, rolled
out a jammer tip line (1-855-55NOJAM), and issued several fines [9].
Despite the regulation, preventing jamming remains difficult to
enforce. Furthermore, wireless softwarization is making jamming
potentially a ubiquitous threat, as demonstrated by the nexmon
framework [28], and Google Project Zero exploitation of a Wi-Fi
chipset firmware [26], and recognized in numerous work [33]. Fi-
nally, the impact of jamming goes beyond denial of the increasingly
critical services relying on wireless communication, it can also be
the prelude to more sophisticated attacks such as rogue infrastruc-
ture (Wi-Fi and Cellular) and hijacking of physical assets (GPS).

In this paper, we are concerned with the design and evaluation
of a universal anti-jamming building block, that is agnostic to the
specifics of the communication link and can therefore be combined
with existing technologies. We believe that such a block should
not require explicit probes, sounding, training sequences, chan-
nel estimation, or even the cooperation of the transmitter. To meet
these requirements, we propose an approach that relies on advances
in Machine Learning and the promises of neural accelerators and
software defined radios. In a nutshell, we develop a deep learning
architecture and models that drive a multi-antenna system to infer
the existence of interference, the number of interfering emissions
and their respective phases. This information is continuously fed
into an algorithm that cancels the interfering signal. We note that
wireless communications aim at very low Bit Error Rate (BER typ-
ically below 10−4) while ML systems are typically content with
much lower performance. Therefore, the ML estimates require care-
ful processing to avoid abrupt changing in the receiver RF chain. We
address these challenges, prototype our techniques, and evaluate
them in a variety of scenarios with multiple modulation schemes,
demonstrating good performance for a receiver exposed to a jam-
mer that is two orders of magnitude higher than the legitimate
signal. For instance, we demonstrate that a receiver integrating our
approach can detect the jammer with over 99% of accuracy and
achieve high jamming-resistance with a Bit Error Rate (BER) as low
as 10−6 while the jammer power is 18dB higher than the legitimate
signal. We note that our approach does not require changes to the

bandwidth, modulation scheme. This is a standard assumption and
further resilience to jamming can be achieved by allowing the com-
municating nodes to randomize such parameters (e.g., frequency
hopping). We assume that the sender uses a single transmitting
antenna, and that the receiver uses two antennas with the same
gain to receive signals. We assume that the nodes are neither aware
of each other’s location, nor the location of the jammer. We consider
a slow-fading channel, therefore a low-mobility for the involved
parties. This concretely means that the channel characteristics do
not change abruptly within a packet (e.g., 1 ms).

Adversary Model. We consider an attacker (jammer) using a sin-
gle antenna transmitting signals on the same channel as the users,
interfering with the legitimate communications (Figure 1). We al-
lows a powerful adversary that already knows the link parameters
such as center frequency, bandwidth and potentially other set-
tings. The jammer is allowed to transmit either random interfering
samples, or modulated packets, with a continuous or intermittent
pattern (it can also be a reactive jammer). We also assume a similar
low-mobility pattern for the jammer so that the channel character-
istics do not change abruptly within a packet.

Communication Channel Model. The communicating nodes
can use arbitrary modulation and coding schemes and are exposed
to the typical additive Gaussian noise (AWGN) in addition to the
jammer interference. We assume the channel gains to be fairly
stable throughout the considered bandwidth. In our evaluations, we
consider differential BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, and 16-QAM modulations
for the communicating nodes. We evaluate our system in both
over-the-air setups, and using RF coax cable. The cable setup is
for reproducibility and in order to systematically and extensively
assess the performance of the approach over a range of three orders
of magnitude of powers (35 dB), and multiple phase offsets.

2.2 Theoretical Foundations and Approach

Jamming Fundamentals. Consider a sender and a receiver com-
municating over a slow fading channel. It is standard to model a
conventional system using a single antenna, as receiving a signal 𝑅
(represented as a complex number) that comprises the transmitting
signal 𝑆, adjusted to account for the channel gain ℎ, and additive
white Gaussian noise 𝑁 :

𝑅 = ℎ𝑆 + 𝑁

(1)

In the absence of interference, the quality/capacity of such link
is determined by the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), which is propor-
|ℎ |2
|𝑁 |2 (where |.| denotes the complex norm). Assuming that
tional to
additive noise is constant over time, the SNR only depends on |ℎ|.
The receiver achieves better Bit Error Rate (BER) when the channel
gain |ℎ| is higher, which is reflected in a higher SNR.

Now assume the presence of an adversary (jammer), who knows
the frequency channel that the legitimate nodes are operating over.
The adversary transmits a "jamming" signal 𝐽 that interferes with
the legitimate signal 𝑆 (as shown in Figure 1a). The receiving signal
now becomes:

𝑅 = ℎ𝑆𝑆 + ℎ𝐽 𝐽 + 𝑁

link modulation schemes or reliance on approaches such as spread
spectrum. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

• A novel RFML approach based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) for universal anti-jamming and cancelling
interference.

• A neural network architecture, model, and supporting algo-
rithms for high-accuracy multi-antenna jamming cancella-
tion.

• A two-antenna SDR-based prototype receiver that leverages
the proposed CNN model and algorithms for jamming can-
cellation and operates in a modulation-agnostic way (BPSK,
QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM).

• The system is evaluated in various settings demonstrating
the jammer detection accuracy of over 99% and achieving
a BER as low as 10−6 even against jammers that are 18dB
more powerful than the legitimate sender. Moreover, our
system can achieve over 30dB gain when operating at a
BER under 10−4 compared to a receiver without our jammer
cancellation.

2 PROBLEM STATEMENT AND APPROACH
We first formulate the problem of interest, the communications
and adversarial models, and present the underlying theoretical
foundations to our jammer cancellation approach.

2.1 Models
We consider a setup with two legitimate nodes communicating
in the presence of an adversary intentionally interfering with the
communications. In the following, we define the models for the
legitimate nodes, adversary, and channel.

Sender and Receiver Model. For the purpose of this work, we
assume that the legitimate nodes are communicating over a pre-
agreed channel and link parameters, including the center frequency,

Ratio (SINR) which is proportional to

where ℎ𝑆 and ℎ𝐽 are the channel gains corresponding to the sender
and the jammer, respectively. The decodability of the legitimate
signal is now dependent on the Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise
|ℎ𝐽 𝐽 |2+|𝑁 |2 . When the jam-
ming power is considerably high relatively to the channel noise,
(cid:12)ℎ𝐽 𝐽 (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12) ≫ |𝑁 |, the SINR can be approximated as proportional to the
|ℎ𝑆 |2
|ℎ𝐽 𝐽 |2 . As the interference becomes stronger,
channel gain ratio
|ℎ𝑆 |
|ℎ𝐽 𝐽 | is subsequently smaller and the legitimate signal 𝑆 becomes
undecodable.

|ℎ𝑆 |2

Approach. To remove the jamming component from the received
signal 𝑅, in a single-antenna, is challenging without having control
over the jammer, knowing the jamming signal, or resorting to other
dimensions to evade the jammer (e.g., as in spread spectrum). Our
approach instead relies on two antennas at the receiving node,
each collects a copy of the transmitted signals (subject to different
channel gains):

𝑆 + ℎ𝐽1
𝑆 + ℎ𝐽2
Considering a jammer significantly above the noise, the cancellation
is achieved using the formula:

𝑅1 = ℎ𝑆1
𝑅2 = ℎ𝑆2

𝐽 + 𝑁1
𝐽 + 𝑁2

(3)

𝑅1 − 𝑝1𝑅2 = 𝑝2𝑆

(4)

ℎ𝐽1
ℎ𝐽2

where 𝑝1 =
, and 𝑝2 = ℎ𝑆1 − 𝑝1ℎ𝑆2 . If the new channel gain 𝑝2
of signal 𝑆 is sufficiently large, we can decode 𝑆 and achieve a good
BER.

|ℎ𝐽1 |
|ℎ𝐽2 |

the amplitude ratio 𝐴𝐽 =

The main challenge is how to estimate parameter 𝑝1 correctly.
Here, we emphasize that traditional MIMO approaches rely on train-
ing sequences and sounding procedures (cooperatively between
the transmitter and receiver) to estimate the channel gain. Such
approach is not applicable in this case, because the receiver cannot
control the jamming signal. We first reformulate 𝑝1 in the polar rep-
𝑒 𝑗 (𝜙 𝐽1 −𝜙 𝐽2) . To find 𝑝1, we are required to estimate
resentation
|ℎ𝐽1 |
|ℎ𝐽2 | and the phase shift Δ𝜙 𝐽 :
Δ𝜙 𝐽 = 𝜙 𝐽1 − 𝜙 𝐽2
(5)
We use two different approaches to estimate 𝐴𝐽 and Δ𝜙 𝐽 . For the
amplitude ratio, we rely on the fact that the parameter is propor-
tional to the square root of the ratio of jamming power received
at the antennas. On that account, we estimate using the measured
power in the periods before and during the collision ( Section 4.2).
To estimate the phase shift, we developed a lightweight, yet power-
ful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that directly estimates
from the 𝐼 /𝑄 RF samples. The ability of CNN to analyze and infer
diverse complex data has been investigated and utilized in various
areas [2, 16, 22, 29]. Estimating the phase shift involves extracting
and synthesizing low-level patterns of the original jamming sig-
nal embedded in the RF samples. In conventional wireless systems
design, such patterns are extracted through signal processing fil-
ters, which makes the layers of convolutional filters of CNN an
ideal candidate for the task. Our CNN not only can disentangle
the collision and estimate the phase shifts for both legitimate and
jamming signals, but also can infer if the estimations correspond to

data-containing signals or just noise. The latter allows us to detect
the presence of a jammer and to distinguish between the three pos-
sible states of the communication channel: (1) When the channel
is clear, (2) when only the jammer or the sender is transmitting,
and (3) when the communicating nodes are being interfered with
by the jammer. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first
that considers CNN as a multi-functional approach for detecting
and cancelling jammers. More details of the approach are presented
in Section 3 and Section 4.

However, we note that multi-antenna jammer nulling has in-
trinsic limitations. Even with accurate estimates of the amplitude
ratio and phase shift, it is not guaranteed that jamming cancella-
tion can fully recover the original signal. As we mentioned earlier,
removing 𝐽 , results in signal 𝑆 being subject to an update gain
ℎ𝐽1
value ℎ𝑆1 − 𝑝1ℎ𝑆2 where 𝑝1 =
. This gain becomes small when
ℎ𝐽2
ℎ𝑆1
, equivalently Δ𝜙𝑆 ≈ Δ𝜙 𝐽 i.e. the separation between the
ℎ𝑆2
phase shifts corresponding to channel gains of signals 𝑆 and 𝐽 is
small:

This derives from the intrinsic limitation of multi-antenna system
to not be able to distinguish between two emitters that are aligned
with the receiver. In the later sections, we will show the impact of
parameter 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 to the jamming cancellation approach through
extensive experiments for Bit Error Rate evaluation.

3 JAMMING DETECTION AND PHASE SHIFT

ESTIMATION

When the communication is interfered by jammer, estimating the
phase shift Δ𝜙 𝐽 (in Equation (5)) is challenging without explicit
information about the jamming signal. Firstly, the received sig-
nal introduces an entanglement of legitimate and jamming signals.
Secondly, the constructive and destructive effects of multi-path
propagation on the signal’s phase is typically unpredictable. Our
approach to address this challenge centers around a fast and accu-
rate convolutional neural network (CNN) which can estimate the
phase shift precisely as well as recognize the current state of the
channel (as outlined in Section 2.2) and detect the jammer. We are
inspired by CNN’s capability of extracting relevant low-level fea-
tures from various types of data such as visual [13, 29], speech [2],
RF [22], and text [16]. In this section, we present our design of the
CNN, as well as the components for training the neural network
specially for the jamming detection and cancellation.

3.1 Challenges and Goals of The Design
As outlined in Section 2.2, our main goal is to accurately estimate
the phase shift Δ𝜙 𝐽 of the jamming signal 𝐽 . However, to account
for all possibilities and ensure the cancellation is done on the right
signal (the jamming signal 𝐽 ), we first analyze the challenges and
define the goals for our CNN design.

Challenges. While developing the convolutional neural network
(CNN) model for phase shift estimation, we encountered two main
challenges . First, with a single estimation, it is hard to guess
whether the phase shift associates with the legitimate or the jam-
ming signal. This is especially more confusing when an adversary

tries to mimic the legitimate communication, e.g., by using the same
modulation. As a result, in the worst case scenario, we can instead
inadvertently cancel the legitimate signal. Second, the receiver
does not know the current state of the communication channel, i.e.,
how many transmitters are concurrently using it. This could lead
to another catastrophic scenario when the sender is transmitting
without being interfered, while the receiver still believes that a col-
lision is happening and unintentionally removes the signal using
the estimated phase shift.

Goals. We defined two goals for the design of that target CNN to
address the above challenges. First, the phase shift estimations for
both the legitimate signal 𝑆 and the jamming signal 𝐽 are required
instead of for the latter only. This is intuitively possible to achieve
with a CNN since that signals 𝑆 and 𝐽 are typically incoherent,
therefore the unique features of both signals can be extracted by
stacks of trained convolutional filters. Second, for each estimated
phase shift, we also infer whether it is the estimation of a data-
containing signal or of noise. As such, the neural network outputs
a confidence value along each inferred phase. This indicates the
presence of a signal if the confidence is larger than 0.5, and indicates
noise otherwise. We reckon that this signal detection ability can
help solve a more general class of problems than an approach of
estimating the number of emitters, because the former can identify
the phase shift of signals when there is one emitter while the latter
cannot. This is useful to track the jamming signal and identify the
type of jammer. These capabilities allow us to recognize the current
state of the communication channel, to detect the jammer (i.e.
when both signal detection outputs indicate a signal), and to avoid
the chance of accidentally removing the legitimate signal without
any means to recover.

3.2 Neural Network Architecture
Our development of the CNN started with defining the input layer
for RF data. Naturally, we want to avoid feeding a very long stream
of RF samples to the CNN at once due to the heavy computational
cost. To address this, we divide the stream of 𝐼 /𝑄 samples into
blocks of a fixed length 𝑀 (In our implementation, 𝑀 = 128 sam-
ples). Then, we transform each block into a 2 × 𝑀 matrix where
the first row comprises the In-phase (I) values and the second row
comprise the Quadrature (Q) values of 𝑀 RF samples (shown in Fig-
ure 2). It is noted that this process is done for both antennas at the
receiver. Finally, we stack the matrices of the two antennas along
the third dimension to form the 2 × 𝑀 × 𝑁 real-valued tensor as
the input of our CNN.

We have considered several possible architecture designs of the
CNN and converged on an optimized CNN structure that achieves
good performance in terms of processing speed and estimation
correctness (See discussion in later sections). The architecture of
our CNN is illustrated in Figure 2, in which a stack of three con-
volutional layers with kernel size of 3 × 3 is followed by a 2 × 1
convolutional layer and a fully-connected layer. 3 × 3 convolutional
layer is a popular Deep Learning technique and has been used as the
building block for state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) architecture
such as VGG [29] and ResNet [13]. As 3×3 convolution is especially
effective for extracting low-level features in different local regions
of the data, we expect the neural network to find robust, unique

features and patterns of the colliding signals from the variation in
the amplitude and phase of contiguous RF samples, and to learn
from them effectively. On the other hand, we use the 2 × 1 convo-
lutional layer with the sample-wise combining of I & Q channels
to gain the high-level semantics of angular distance for estimating
the phase shifts. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation is used for
the convolutional layers because it is computationally efficient and
more effective against the vanishing gradient problem [11].

The fully connected layer synthesizes the output from previous
layers and makes predictions. The outputs 𝑃𝑆1 and 𝑃𝑆2 estimate
the phase shifts for legitimate/interference signals, while 𝐼𝑆1 and
𝐼𝑆2 detect whether the corresponding phase shift estimations come
from a signal or noise. (Again, 1 implies real signal while 0 implies
noise). Sigmoid activation is used for 𝐼𝑆1 and 𝐼𝑆2 to limit the values
in the range [0, 1], while linear activation is used for 𝑃𝑆1 and 𝑃𝑆2 .
We emphasize that as 𝑃𝑆1 and 𝑃𝑆2 cannot be used interchangeably,
we distinguish them by having 𝑃𝑆1 learn the smaller phase shift
while 𝑃𝑆2 learns the bigger one.

3.3 Data Collection
Having a large and carefully labeled dataset is a critical requirement
to train a good neural network model. Unfortunately, data labeling is
normally done by manual labor, which requires domain knowledge
and takes significant amount of time and efforts. Moreover, open
datasets of real RF emissions for jamming cancellation remains
absent in the literature. To address this challenge, we devise an

efficient multi-stage approach to build a large training dataset for
our CNN model, as depicted in Figure 3.

In our setup, we have a single-antenna transmitter (TX) and a
two-antenna receiver (RX). The TX can either act as a legitimate
sender or a jammer. First, we generate random samples and save
in memory both at the TX and RX. Then, the TX transmits using
the saved data samples and the RX records the received RF samples
from each of the two antennas to files. Due to the channel effects,
the received samples are rotated by some unknown phase shift (𝜙1
and 𝜙2 for the two antennas as shown in Figure 3). These values
are different for each of the receiving antennas. To determine these
values, we chunk the received samples and cross-correlate with the
data samples already saved in the RX’s memory from the first step.
𝜙1 and 𝜙2 are then computed from the angular values (argument)
of the correlation outputs with the highest energy (peak). With
this approach, we determine the phase shift Δ𝜙𝑆 (for the legitimate
signal, or Δ𝜙 𝐽 for the jamming signal) by taking the difference of
the two angles. When the communication channel is static, these
phase shifts will experience very little variance. Such dataset would
negatively affects the training and bias the resulting model to a
small range of output values. We address this by devising a simple
RF augmentation technique. For each chunk of RF samples, we
rotate one antenna by a random value between [−𝜋, 𝜋] and adjust
the phase shift calculated in the last step accordingly. This results
in a more diverse dataset.

The above process of acquiring phase shifts is performed for both
the sender and the jammer. After that, we get the data that repre-
sents collisions by adding the samples recorded for the sender and
the jammer together, with the phase shifts Δ𝜙𝑆 and Δ𝜙 𝐽 acquired
from the previous process as the labels for phase shift estimation.
We also collects the data representing noise with the TX turned off.
Our final dataset comprises data and labels for all possible cases:
When the channel is vacant, when it is occupied by one emitter, or
when there are collisions between the sender and the jammer.

3.4 Loss Function and Training

Loss Function. During the training, our CNN aims to minimize a
loss function which represents the errors of phase shift estimations
and signal detections. For the phase shift estimations, we use a
modified Mean Squared Error function:

L𝜙 = 1𝑆1 (Δ𝜙1

− 𝑃𝑆1 )2 + 1𝑆2 (Δ𝜙2

− 𝑃𝑆2 )2

(7)

we use Binary Cross-Entropy loss function:

L𝑆 = −((1𝑆1 log(𝐼𝑆1 ) + 0𝑆1 log(1 − 𝐼𝑆1 ))+
(1𝑆2 log(𝐼𝑆2 ) + 0𝑆2 log(1 − 𝐼𝑆2 )))
, 𝐼𝑆2 are the outputs for signal detection associated respec-
where 𝐼𝑆1
tively with 𝑃𝑆1
, 𝑃𝑆2 . Meanwhile, 0𝑆1 (0𝑆2 ) is the complement of 1𝑆1
(1𝑆2 ). The final loss function is the sum of the two loss components:
L = L𝜙 + L𝑆
(9)

(8)

Training. After a large number of iterations for validation, our
CNN is finalized for the training. We use PyTorch library [23] to
develop the CNN model. To improve the training convergence and
eliminate the needs for regularization, we utilize Batch Normaliza-
tion [14] on the outputs of the convolutional layers. Furthermore,
we minimize the possibility of overfitting by using a Learning Rate
Decay technique [10] in which we lower the learning rate when
the validation error does not improve over a period of time, e.g., a
few training epochs. We emphasize that the phase shift estimations
𝑃𝑆1
, 𝑃𝑆2 are made distinguishable during training by assigning them
to learn the smaller and bigger phase shifts, respectively.

4 JAMMING CANCELLATION
In this section, we present the details of our jamming cancella-
tion procedure that utilizes the phase shift estimations and signal
detections from the CNN model. To perform the cancellation as
discussed in Section 2.2, we devise the algorithms and formulas
for estimating the amplitude ratio and for making the phase shift
estimations more robust. The jamming cancellation algorithm is
described in Algorithm 1.

jamming signal when collisions happen (as shown in Algorithm 1).
When only 1𝑇

rently used by a single transmitter, which can be either the legiti-
mate sender or the jammer. We identify the jammer by checking
if the RF samples are decodable. In this case the capability of the
jammer is limited to degrading the communications between the
nodes by occupying the channel. If we identify the jammer’s pres-
ence (samples are not decodable), the estimation 𝑃𝑇

signifies the jamming signal. In the case where the adversary trans-
mits data that mimicks legitimate communications, a solution can
consist of duplicating the receiver chain continuously tracking and
decoding both inferred signals (at the expense of doubling the re-
ceiver cost). Smarter approaches are possible by tracking the phases
of the transmitters of interest and canceling other ones.

which will be described in Section 4.3. We emphasize that our
detection is effective even if the jammer transmits at low-power (i.e.
the jamming signal is weaker than the legitimate signal). Therefore,
this low-level of interference will also be canceled.

Apart from estimating the jamming phase shift, we also need to

estimate the amplitude ratio 𝐴𝐽 =
|ℎ𝐽2 | as discussed in Section 2.2.
We introduce the intuition behind our approach. We analyze the
power variation of RF samples in the periods before and during the
collision, presented in details in Section 4.2. With the phase shift
and amplitude ratio estimated, the receiver can solve Equation (4)
= 𝐴𝐽 𝑒 𝑗 Δ𝜙𝐽 to null the jamming component in the

received signal. The legitimate signal now has a new gain 𝑝2 and can
be used to decode the data. While 𝑝2 is not necessary to estimate,
as mentioned in Section 2.2, we note that the phase shift separation
𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 between signals 𝑆 and 𝐽 has a direct impact on the gain 𝑝2
and subsequently the quality of the final signal. This impact will be
measured and discussed in Section 5.
When both 1𝑇

𝑆2

ther communication nor jamming is happening in the channel and
we can skip this period. The ability to identify this channel state
helps the receiver to reduce the computational power and to avoid
corrupting the phase shift estimation in the long run.

4.2 Amplitude Ratio Estimation
Our algorithm for estimating the amplitude ratio is described in
Algorithm 2. It should be noted that as described in Section 4.1,
Algorithm 2 is only triggered when a collision is detected and the
amplitude ratio needs to be estimated to perform the jamming
cancellation. Our approach is inspired by the observation that the
power of a receiving antenna during a collision comprises two
independent, separable components for the legitimate signal 𝑆 and
the jamming signal 𝐽 . Suppose during time period 𝑇 , the receiver
collects 𝑁 digital RF samples from the analog input of antenna 𝑖,

𝑖 ∈ {1, 2}. To do this, we first determine whether the legitimate
sender or the jammer transmits first, right before the collision (using
the detection capability described in Section 4.1), then calculate
the power accordingly. Here, we assume the sender’s power is
stable during the transmission of a packet (slow fading channel),
so the measurement of 𝐸𝑆𝑖 at the beginning of the collision can be
used until the end of that collision. Our algorithm looks at period
𝑇 − 1 right before the collision, and identifies the transmitter in
that period with parameter 𝐼𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡
(which is updated in Algorithm 1
and utilized in Algorithm 2). If the sender appears in period 𝑇 − 1
(where 𝐼𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡
= 0), we can measure 𝐸𝑆𝑖 and calculate 𝐴𝐽 . Otherwise,
we know that the jammer appears in period 𝑇 − 1, and we can
measure 𝐸𝐽𝑖 and update 𝐸𝑆𝑖 with the current power 𝐸𝑖 . It should be
noted that in the latter case, the new 𝐸𝑆𝑖 is used until the end of the
collision and should not be updated again if we detect a collision in
the previous period.

are used directly to solve the jamming cancellation equation. This

Δ𝜙 𝐽 is more stable which makes the jamming cancellation process

parameter impact the performance of the cancellation through
experimental evaluations in Section 5.

5 EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate our CNN-based jamming cancellation
approach in multiple settings of modulations and wireless channels.
Using the techniques mentioned in Section 3.3, we collect RF sam-
ples transmitted by a sender and a jammer through coaxial cables to
a receiver, and build a dataset containing 7, 648, 260 real-valued data
tensors of size 2 × 128 × 2 reflecting 𝐼 /𝑄 values of 128 RF samples
collected by two antennas. Each data tensor is labeled by the phase
shifts of signals embedded in the data (if the data is collected from
the sender, or the jammer, or the combination of the two) and the
signal indicators (0 for noise and 1 for real signal) for their respec-
tive phases. The transmitters and receiver are implemented using
GNURadio [1] running on ETTUS USRP B210 software-defined
radios. The radios use differential BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK and 16-QAM
modulation schemes to transmit and receive at a center frequency
of 795 MHz. We split the dataset into three parts used for training,
validation, and testing with the ratio 0.64 : 0.16 : 0.2, respectively.
Our trained CNN model is used for both over-the-cables evalu-
ation (Section 5.2) and over-the-air evaluation (Section 5.3). We
emphasize that while the CNN model is trained only using the
data collected through cables, our jamming cancellation approach
still performs well in over-the-air indoor environment with the
presence of multi-path and other channel effects not experienced
in the cabled environments.

5.1 Neural Network Comparison
Beyond evaluating the performance of our novel approach, we are
also interested in understanding the performance of the specific
CNN architecture we proposed. Towards this goal, we compare it
with existing CNN models from the literature, in terms of estimation
error and network forward time (i.e., the elapsed time from when the
network receives data to when it outputs estimations). In our setup,
we train our CNN model (called JC-CNN), VGG16 [29], ResNet [13],
and the modulation recognition CNN (MR-CNN) [22] and evalu-
ate using the training and test set of our jamming detection and
cancellation dataset, respectively. The models are implemented,
trained, and tested using the Pytorch library [23] and CUDA [21]
Version 10.2 running on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU. We
use Adam Optimizer [17] and ReduceLROnPlateau learning rate
scheduler [38] with initial learning rate 𝑙𝑟 = 0.005 for the training
of all models. The metric for estimation error is the combination
loss denoted by Equation (9). To benchmark the forward time, we
use Pytorch’s torch.cuda.synchronize wrapping around neu-
ral network’s forward propagation function to synchronize CUDA
operations for accurate timing measurement. The final test loss and
forward time are achieved by averaging over 20, 000 iterated mea-
surements, and illustrated in Figure 4. It is clear that our JC-CNN
model outperforms MR-CNN in the correctness of the estimations,
with the test error of 0.57 compared to 2.21 of MR-CNN (over
3.8 times lower), while is slightly less accurate than VGG-16 and
ResNet18 with the test losses of 0.45 and 0.48, respectively. How-
ever, our model is 12.95 times faster than ResNet18 and 8.3 times
faster than VGG16. Therefore, the JC-CNN model has a better opti-
mization of speed and accuracy for this task and is more suitable
to deploy for real-time and embedded applications.

5.2 Over-The-Cables Evaluation
First, we evaluate the efficiency of the jamming cancellation ap-
proach in a relatively idealistic environment where RF signals prop-
agate through coaxial cables, thus multi-path and other fading
effects are absent. Our setup comprises a sender, a receiver and
a jammer, where the sender and the jammer transmit modulated
signals using differential BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK and 16-QAM. The
efficiency of jamming cancellation is measured by the Bit Error Rate
metric, which we calculate by comparing and counting the error
bits between the sent and the received signals (signals are recorded
at the nodes and transferred to the host computer for calculation).
In Section 2.2 we show that the phase shift separation 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 =
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
Δ𝜙𝑆 − Δ𝜙 𝐽
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12) being very small can cause negative effects to the legit-
(cid:12)
imate signal even when the jamming signal is completely removed.
In our experiment, the transmitters are connected to the sender by
identical coaxial cables, in which 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 ≈ 0. To address this, we
introduce an artificial channel effect by shifting the phases of the
antennas. Depending on the shifting, 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 will receive a differ-
ent value. We discuss the impact of 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 on the efficiency of the
jamming cancellation in the evaluation below.

Impact of Phase Separation. Section 5.3 shows the Bit Error Rate

values of 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 :
3 . In this evaluation, the jamming
cancellation algorithm uses the estimation smoothing with param-
eter 𝜆 = 0.01. First, it is clear to see that our cancellation approach
can achieve very high jamming resistance: It allows the receiver to
operate at BER of 10−6 with the Signal-to-Jamming Ratio of −18dB
(i.e., the jammer is 63 times more powerful than the legitimate sig-
nal) for QPSK with 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 = 2𝜋
3 . Interestingly, when compared with
the case of no cancellation, our approach achieves over 30dB gain for
all modulations when operating at a BER of under 10−4 (e.g. 31 dB

states: (1) When there is no transmission and the channel is clear,
(2) when there is a single transmission, and (3) when there are two
transmissions (from the sender and the jammer) causing collisions.
We note that in the second case, the transmitter being the sender
or the jammer is decided by the decoding check in Algorithm 1.
Table 1 and Figure 7 depict the classification results, in which the
CNN classifies three states: Noise (no transmission), Single (one
transmission) and Collision (two transmissions). Our CNN model
achieves 97.44% accuracy, where it can reach over 99% accuracy for
the Noise and Collision states while the accuracy of Single state
prediction is only about 5% lower. We also get high scores for other
metrics, over 0.98 for both Precision, Recall and F1-Score. The re-
sults justify the capability of our CNN model to identify the current
channel state, and more importantly, the presence of a jammer
(by recognizing collisions with 99.89% accuracy) in the realistic
environment without the needs to retrain the model trained in the
idealistic environment (i.e. coaxial cables).

Jamming Resistance. To demonstrate the jamming resistance ca-
pability of our approach in over-the-air environments, we devise
four setup configurations for our experiments. In each configu-
ration, we randomly position the jammer, while the locations of
the sender and the receiver remain fixed. To evaluate, we measure
the Bit Error Rate (BER) of the received data for every case. As
discussed in the previous sections, different configurations will
introduce different phase shift separations 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 that impact the
quality of the signal resulting from the jamming cancellation. To
measure 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 for each configuration, we use the cross-correlation
technique presented in Section 3.3. The BER evaluation results in
Figure 8 show that the receiver equipped with the jamming can-
cellation (𝐽𝐶) achieves the best jamming resistance for both BPSK,
QPSK, 8-PSK and 16-QAM modulations with the 1𝑠𝑡 configuration
whose phase shift separation is biggest (measured in Table 2). More
specifically, we can operate with BPSK at BER of 10−6 under a
Signal-to-Jamming Ratio (SJR) of −12 dB in the 1𝑠𝑡 configuration,
and under a SJR of -6 dB in the 2𝑛𝑑 configuration (which has the
second-largest 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 ), while we only achieve the BER of down to
10−3 and 10−4 under a SJR of 0 dB for the 3𝑟𝑑 and 4𝑡ℎ configurations,
respectively. In the 3𝑟𝑑 configuration when the sender’s signal and
the jammer’s signal are nearly phase-aligned (𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 has the lowest
value of 0.34), the resulting signal is especially weak and causes a
high BER, i.e., over 10−2 for all modulations at SJR = 0 except BPSK.
This impact of 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 justifies the theory in Section 2.2 and our
findings in over-the-cables experiments. Furthermore, we can also
see that the efficiency of the jamming cancellation decreases as the
modulation order increases. More specifically, compared to the case
of BPSK modulation, using QPSK drops the jamming resistance
by 2 − 3dB, while the drop is 4 − 5dB for 8-PSK and over 10dB
for 16-QAM. This is expected because higher-order modulations
have a smaller distance between the constellation points that cause

2 , and by 9dB when it decreases to

for BPSK and 34 dB for QPSK with 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 = 2𝜋
3 ). In addition, we
also see that the jamming cancellation performs better as 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙
gets bigger. For instance, the jamming resistance when operating at
a BER of 10−6 with BPSK modulation drops by 3dB when 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 de-
creases from 2𝜋
𝜋
3 . It is easy
to see the same trend for the other modulations. This limitation is
intrinsic to multi-antenna jamming cancelation as the receiver can-
not resolve two transmitter that are aligned with it. Furthermore,
we also see that the efficiency of our jamming cancellation when
using 8-PSK and 16-QAM is lower compared to BPSK and QPSK,
which is expected because they have smaller distance between the
constellation points and thus are more prone to bit errors [25].

Impact of Estimation Smoothing. We investigate the impact of
phase shift estimation smoothing on the jamming cancellation with
the Bit Error Rate evaluation shown in Figure 5a. In this case, we use
BPSK signals and 𝑆𝑒𝑝Δ𝜙 = 𝜋
2 . It is clear to see that the smoothing
significantly improves the jamming resistance: We achieve 11 and
15 dB gain with 𝜆 = 0.1 and 0.01 when operating at BER below 10−4,
respectively. This effect can also be seen in Figure 5b, where the
estimation smoothing helps stabilizing the energy of the samples
and reduce both the degree and the frequency of energy variation,
resulting in better BER. Finally, setting 𝜆 to 0.01 makes the energy
more stable and yields better jamming resistance (−14 dB of SJR
compared to −9dB for 𝜆 = 0.1 when operating at BER=10−6, while
decreasing 𝜆 to 0.001 does not improve the performance further.
Therefore, we selected 𝜆 = 0.01 for all later evaluations.

5.3 Over-The-Air Evaluation

Jammer Detection. We conduct over-the-air experiments to as-
sess the ability of our CNN model to detect a jammer detection,
in an environment different from the one used for training, i.e.,
model trained on data recorded through cables is evaluated for
over-the-air without re-training. Similar to over-the-cables exper-
iments, our setup consists of a sender, a receiver, and a jammer.
We use differential BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK and 16-QAM modulations
for the transmissions. The testbed is positioned in an indoor en-
vironment, where there are common RF-blocking and reflecting
objects such as a PC, monitor, walls, and desks. To evaluate the
detection capability, we focus on the classification of three channel

higher probability of bit errors [25]. However, we note that the
BER when not using our Jamming Cancellation is ≈ 0.5 (theoreti-
cal maximum) for all the transmission settings and configurations
shown in Figure 8. Therefore, the results indicate the efficiency of
our jamming cancellation approach, as well as the universality for
anti-jamming multiple modulation and in different environments
not present during the training of the CNN model.

6 DISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK
The results show that our approach can perform well under the
impact of multi-path, albeit Equation (3) only shows a single chan-
nel gain for either the jammer or the sender in the received signal.
Nonetheless, the results do not contradict the cancellation theory.
As explained in [32], the sum of the channel gains of all the paths
from the sender (or the jammer) to the receiver can be viewed as
a new channel gain of the line-of-sight path between the receiver
and the sender/jammer being put in a different location. There-
fore, Equation (3) is also applicable in this case, and the jamming
cancellation is still effective.

It is demonstrated that the performance of multi-antenna jam-
ming cancellation systems degrades when the emitters are phase-
aligned. The next challenge is how to ensure a desirable phase
shift separation to distinguish between two emitters and cancel the
unwanted signal. To address this, it is intuitive to use and optimize
a larger antenna array to exploit the diversity of multi-antenna

and enhance the robustness of cancellation. On that account, ex-
ploring optimized settings of antenna array for robust jamming
cancellation would be an interesting direction for our future work.
Traditional anti-jamming at the physical layer has been relying
on spread spectrum techniques, which require the coordinating
nodes to pre-share a secret key. Recent research efforts have ad-
dressed that limitation for FHSS [18, 30, 31, 34], or DSSS [19, 24],
or both [15]. Nonetheless, these approaches are designed with the
specific goal to remove the pre-shared secret and not to counter
powerful jammers, i.e., a few orders stronger than the sending node.
There has been efforts on multi-antenna anti-jamming designed
specifically for MIMO system [36, 39]. Compared to those approaches,
our work is unique in the sense that we do not need training se-
quences or pilots for channel estimation. In a recent work [32],
the authors develop a hybrid anti-jamming system that utilizes
mechanical antenna steering and multi-antenna software cancel-
lation. While this approach achieves high jamming resiliency, the
efficiency of the cancellation relies heavily on the after-effect of
mechanical steering to the received jamming signal, while our CNN-
based cancellation can operate even when the interference remains
powerful.

In addition, researchers have spent significant efforts mitigating
jammers at higher layers such as MAC [3, 27], network layer [6],
cross-layer [5] or timing channel between datalink and network
layers [35]. Nonetheless, the need for an efficient, resilient anti-
jamming technique for physical layer security is still very important
because of the fact that high-power jammers are increasingly easy
to build nowadays.

Advances in Machine Learning and Deep Learning have been
utilized in various domains including anti-jamming. In [12], Deep
Reinforcement Learning is used to derive an optimal frequency
hopping strategy to evade jammers. In [7], the authors investigate
Generative Adversarial Network for both jamming strategies and

defense. Meanwhile, the anti-jamming capability of Convolutional
Neural Networks - a vital Deep Learning building block, remains
unexplored. Convolutional Neural Networks were successful in var-
ious tasks of wireless communications, such as modulation recogni-
tion [22], and RF emissions detection and classification [20]. To the
best of our knowledge, our anti-jamming approach is the first work
in the literature that utilizes CNNs to detect and cancel jammers
efficiently. We achieve over 99% accuracy for detecting jammers
and can enhance a RF receiver to achieve a Bit Error Rate as low as
10−6 while facing an adversary at 18dB higher power than the legit-
imate signal. Our approach is agnostic to the communication link,
i.e., does not require modifications to the link modulation, thus can
be used as an universal anti-jamming and interference-cancelling
module for existing technologies and systems.
