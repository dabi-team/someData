Synopsis  - Linear dependence of the reflectivity spectra on the resonant absorption coefficient 
are obtained in the total external reflection region but only for ideal cases of low-absorptive 
homogeneous resonant media or ultrathin resonant layers. Restrictions for simplified treatment 
of the  reflectivity  spectra  as  absorption ones  are  revealed  by  theoretical analysis  and model 
calculations.  

Abstract - Approximate expressions for X-ray resonant and Mössbauer reflectivity in the total 
external reflection region are developed for the limiting cases of a semiinfinite mirror with a 
small resonant addition to the total susceptibility and for the case of an ultrathin resonant layer. 
It  is  shown that  in  this  region  the  reflectivity  can  really show  the  linear  dependence  on the 
imaginary  part  of  resonant  susceptibility,  therefore  in  these  cases  the  consideration  of 
reflectivity  spectra  (R-spectra)  as  absorption  resonant  spectra,  undertaken  in  several 
experimental  works,  can  be  justified.  However,  we  have  selected  several  effects  producing 
essential dispersive distortions of the R-spectrum shape even for very small grazing angles. It 
has been shown that the dispersive corrections to the R-spectrum shape are mostly essential if 
the  nonresonant  absorption  is  relatively  large.  Model  calculations  demonstrate  that  the 
quantitative  spectroscopic  information  extracted  from  R-spectra  by  using  the  software 
developed for absorption spectra can be inaccurate.

Introduction 

X-ray spectral diagnostic (XANES, XMCD, XNCD, XRMR, DAFS, as well as Mössbauer 

spectroscopy) actively developing at synchrotrons opens a new era in investigations of chemical 
bonds,  electronic  structure  of  atoms,  element  specific  magnetic  properties  for  samples  in 
different environments (temperature, pressure, magnetic and electric fields). Absorption spectra 
(measured  directly  or  by  fluorescence  or  electron  total  yield)  can  be  straight  used  for 
identification  of  different  transitions  between  electron  shells,  for  application  of  sum  rules 
determining  spin  and  orbital  contributions  to  the  atomic  magnetic  moment,  for  extracting 
hyperfine interaction parameters in the case of Mössbauer spectra and so on. There are a lot of 
computer  procedure  and  software  packages  for  treating  absorption  spectra  (like  sum  rules 
(Thole  et  al.,  1992;  Carra  et  al.,  1992;  O'Brien  &  Tonnere,  1994),  Mössbauer  UNIVEM-
MS program and  MossWinn  code  (Klencsár  et  al.,  1996),  CONFIT2000  (Žák  &  Jirásková, 
2006), SpectrRelax (Matsnev & Rusakov, 2012) and so on). 

In many cases, e.g. for investigations of thin resonant layers or surfaces with synchrotron 
radiation  (mostly  suitable  for  angular  resolved  measurements),  the  spectra  are  measured  in 
reflection geometry at small grazing angles. Contrary to the absorption spectra depended only

from the imaginary part of the refractive index, reflectivity spectra (R-spectra) depend on the 
real and imaginary parts of the reflective index in a quite complicated manner through Fresnel 
formula (Born & Wolf, 1968), Parratt algorithm (Parratt, 1954), or 4×4 matrix formalism for 
anisotropic multilayers (Borzdov et al., 1976; Azzam & N. Bashara, 1977; Zak et al., 1991; 
Irkaev  et  al.,  1994;  Röhlsberger,  1999;  Stepanov  &  Sinha,  2000). Therefore,  the  extracting 
spectroscopic information from R-spectra is not direct and is connected with a time-consuming 

fit procedure. For relatively large glancing angles ( > 23 c, c is the critical angle of the total 

external  reflection)  the  kinematic  approach  of  the  X-ray  reflectivity  theory  (Hamley  & 
Pedersen, 1994) can be applied which allows simpler treating R-spectra (for Mössbauer Bragg 
reflections  from  periodic  multilayers  it  had  been  analyzed  in  e.g.  (Andreeva  &  Lindgren, 
2005)). In the total reflection region the simple kinematic approximation cannot be applied, at 
the same time in this region R-spectra look like absorption spectra (specific shapes of R-spectra 
for different grazing angles were investigated long ago (Bernstein & Campbell, 1962; Kao et 
al., 1994)), and in many papers they are treated by software developed for absorption spectra 
fit (see e. g. (Mitsui et al., 2012; Mitsui et al., 2016; Cini et al., 2018; Cucinotta et al., 2020; 
Mitsui et al., 2020; Cini et al., 2020; Okabayashi et al., 2021a; Yokota et al., 2021; Okabayashi 
et al., 2021b)). However, no mathematical support for such procedure has been developed for 
the region of the total external reflection. 

Here we thoroughly analyze the R-spectrum shape in the total reflection region for X-ray 
radiation and outline the limits of the applicability of the simplest procedure for its fit based on 
the absorption software.

Semiinfinite mirror  

2.1. 

Total reflection region  

For the case of isotropic mirror and grazing angles of incidence 

 the Fresnel formula for 

the reflectivity amplitude is independent on the polarization of radiation and is given by the 
well-known expression (Born & Wolf, 1968): 

 ,                                             (1) 

where 

 is a scalar susceptibility which is supposed to be constructed from nonresonant (

) 

and resonant (

) parts: 

 .                  (2) 

Here we use the symbols 

 and 

 which are the conventional designations of the corrections 

to the refractive index 

 for X-ray radiation, 

 is the photon frequency, 

for simplicity here it is  supposed that nonresonant part 

 does not depend on the photon 

energy in the narrow energy interval of resonant transitions (for Mössbauer spectra it is always

We suppose that in the region of the total reflection 

 is large enough compared 

with 

 and negative, so the designation is inserted: 

,                                                 (3) 

and the following approximated expression for the square root is obtained: 

.                                    (4) 

It  has  been  supposed  that 

  and 

.  With 

approximation  (4)  the  reflected  intensity  can  be  presented  by  the  following  expression  (the 
detailed calculations for this and for the following expressions are given in the Appendix):  

 .                         (5) 

It is nice to mark that the obtained expression really establishes the linear dependence 

of  the  reflected  intensity  on  the  imaginary  part 

  of  the  resonant  part  of  the  total 

susceptibility. Therefore, this expression legalizes the attempts to interpret the R-spectra in the 
total reflection region as the absorption spectra and justify the usage the common software for 

their fit, undertaken in e.g. (Mitsui et al., 2012; Mitsui et al., 2016; Cini et al., 2018; Cucinotta 
et al., 2020; Mitsui et al., 2020; Cini et al., 2020; Okabayashi et al., 2021a; Yokota et al., 2021; 
Okabayashi et al., 2021b).  

However, several effects disturb the simplest linear connection between the reflectivity 

and absorption for the angles in the total reflection region given by the expression (5).  

The first effect is the influence of a nonresonant absorption. If 

 the expression (5) 

transforms to a more complicated form: 

.   (6) 

The  expression (6) includes  not  only  a change  in the  nonresonant  background (first 

term), but also a contribution from the real part of the resonant susceptibility 

 to the R-

spectrum  (third  term  in  (6)),  adding  a  dispersion  correction  to  the  R-spectrum  shape.  It  is 

important to note that this dispersion term is proportional to the nonresonant absorption 

.

For an artificial case 

 the R-spectra calculated for grazing angles in the total 

reflection  region  by  the  exact  formula  (1)  and  approximate  expressions  (5)  and  (6)  are 

practically identical and their shape reproduces the energy dependence of 

 (i.e. the shape 

of an absorption spectra). However, even a relatively small nonresonant absorption 

introduces a dispersion distortion of the R-spectrum shape (Fig. 1a), and the further artificial 

increase of 

 makes the asymmetry of the resonant line in R-spectra more clear, besides the 

shift from the exact resonance appears (see Fig. 1b). For this case the difference between the 
exact calculations and calculations by the approximate expressions (5) and even (6) becomes 
essential.

  (this 

  approximately  corresponds  to  an  iron  for  Mössbauer 

(

) (b).  

The second effect is the line interference. Probably the asymmetric distortion of the resonant 

line is not so important for the spectroscopy based on the reflectivity data, but this distortion 

leads to the defacement of the relative weight of different contributions. In absorption spectra 

different contributions are independent from each other, in R-spectra the overlap of the lines 

leads to the mutual influence. That is demonstrated by the picture with two resonance lines of 

equal amplitude: calculated R-spectrum in Fig. 2 shows different intensity for two lines. Note, 

that this effect has been demonstrated in the first paper devoted to the Mössbauer reflectivity 

(Bernstein & Campbell, 1962). Therefore, the treatment of the complicated R-spectra with the 

programs  developed  for  the  absorption  spectroscopy  will  give  the  wrong  weights  of 

contributions.

The third effect is the sequence in the depth position of different contributions. It is well-known 

that the very small penetration depth in the total reflection region changes the relative weight 

of contributions from resonant atoms (nuclei) placed at different depths in a multilayer. This 

effect is illustrated by Fig. 3a. This depth selectivity of the reflectivity method is well known 

and has been effectively used in numerous papers (see e.g. (Bernstein & Campbell, 1962; G. 

Martens  &  P.  Rabe,  1980; Andreeva  et  al.,  1991; Irkaev  et  al.,  1994;  Freeland et  al.,  1997; 

Geissler et al., 2001; Andreeva et al., 2006; Andreeva et al., 2015)). 

The fourth effect is the dichroic scattering. The anisotropy of the resonant scattering supposes 

that the scattering wave can have another polarization than that in the incident wave. In this 

case the reflectivity is described by more complicated formalism than the Fresnel formula (the 

theory of X-ray reflectivity from anisotropic multilayers is presented in e.g. (Borzdov et al., 

1976; Azzam & N. Bashara, 1977;  Zak et al., 1991; Irkaev et al., 1994; Röhlsberger, 1999; 

Stepanov & Sinha, 2000)). The contribution of the rotated polarization to the reflected signal 

changes the ratio of lines in Mössbauer R-spectra. This effect can not be taken into account in 

the single  absorption  process  and  consequently  the treatment  of the  R-spectra  as  absorption 

spectrum  gives  the  wrong  information  about  the  magnetic  field  orientation  (Fig. 3b). 

Calculation of the R-spectra is done for the Bhf azimuth angle 30o relative the beam direction, 

but the ratio of the 1st and 2nd line intensities will correspond 40o if the fit of this spectra will 

be done by the program for the absorption spectrum treatment.

Exact Critical angle 

For completeness we calculate the approximate expression for the Fresnel reflectivity at the 

exact critical angle when

different signs:

which  is  almost  the  same  as  was  given  in  the  paper  (Neumann  et  al.,  1998)  (with  a  slight 

correction negligible when 

). A popular opinion is that at the exact critical angle the 

R-spectrum presents the dispersive part 

 of the refraction index. As follows from (8), 

(11) that is not true: the R-spectrum shape and the polarization asymmetry is mainly determined 

by 

 only when 

, otherwise both the absorption and dispersive parts of the 

resonant  addition  to  the  refractive  index  (

  and 

)  influence  this  spectral 

dependence at the critical angle.

the reflectivity at the exact critical angle

Ultrathin resonant layers  

In several papers the resonant spectra were measured from ultrathin resonant layers. It had 
been  shown  that  the  reflectivity  amplitude  from  an  ultrathin  resonant  layer  placed  under  a 
reflecting medium can be described by the formula (Andreeva & Lindgren, 2002; Andreeva et 
al., 2019): 

 ,                                          (13) 

where 

 is the reflectivity amplitude from an underlying substrate, 

 is the total 

electric field at the position of the resonant layer (if we take the amplitude of the incident wave 

equals  1) and 

  is  the reflectivity amplitude  of the  ultrathin  resonant  layer  in  vacuum 

described by the well-known expression: 

,                                          (14) 

where 

 is the susceptibility of an ultrathin layer having thickness d, 

 is the 

x-rays wavelength.

If the frequency dependence of 

 in (14) is presented by a pure one resonance 

case 

, where

 is the full line-width, 

 is the exact resonant 

frequency,  then  the  reflectivity  from  the  ultrathin  layer  without  any  support  is  given  by 

 which corresponds to the emission line but not to the absorption one. If some 

underlying substrate exists the shape of the resonant line in the R-spectrum becomes different.  

If 

 is small enough then the total reflectivity 

 can be described by the 

following expression: 

   ,                 (15) 

where  we  use 

  and 

  for  selection  of  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of

that is the real part of

 only for a strongly absorptive

. So, if the substrate is 

nonabsorptive, the R-spectrum will have a pure linear dependence on 

. In another words, in 

this  case  the  R-spectrum  of  resonant  ultrathin  layer  can  be  interpreted  as  the  absorption 
spectrum. The dispersion distortion of the R-spectrum depends on the absorption value in a 
nonresonant substrate. 

Even more surprising is that  

,                                                 (20) 

i.e. the ratio of the absorption and dispersion terms in 

 does not depend on the angle 

of incidence (Fig. 4a). Therefore, the shape of R-spectrum from ultrathin layer placed on the 
substrate does not depend on the angle of incidence and its asymmetry is determined only by 

this ratio 

. Thai is probably the reason why in some papers, in which Mössbauer R-

spectra have been measured for ultrathin resonant layers, the angles for incident radiation has 
not  been  pointed  out.  For  relatively  large  absorption  in  substrate  R-spectra  acquire  some 

dispersion addition. That is illustrated by Fig. 4b.

on  a  substrate,  giving  Fresnel  reflectivity.  If  the  layer  is  placed on  some  distance  H  from a 
substrate  the  relation  (20)  is  not  true.  (Such  situation  can  be  approximately  fulfilled  for 
molecules used in Langmuir‐Blodgett method having resonant atoms in their head, like it was 
considered in (Bedzyk et al., 1989), or for e.g. low density small particles covered by a resonant 

isotope (Merkel et al., 2015)). In this case 

 in (15) aсquires an additional phase shift:  

,                                         (21) 

where 

 is the scattering vector. According to (21) 

 and 

 oscillate with the 

increasing of the distance H with a shift of the phase (Fig. 5a), consequently for 

 and 

the more complicated expressions take place. The shape of R-spectrum follows the variations 

of 

 and 

 with the change of the angle 

 (Fig. 5b): the dispersion addition to the shape of 

R-spectrum  becomes  more  pronounced  when

region always 

 and R-spectra looks like the absorption spectra.

Example of experimental data treatment  

In the presented analysis for clarity the different factors disturbing the simple absorption-
like  shape  of  R-spectra  in  the  total  reflection  region  are  considered  individually  while  for 
spectroscopy of the real multilayer samples all of them can influence on the experimental R-
spectra  and  insert  errors  into  the  result  of  their  interpretation  based  on  the  pure  absorption 
concept.

Conclusion 

In summary, we have derived the approximate analytical expressions for the X-ray resonant 

reflectivity in the total reflection angular region which validate the application of the software 

developed  for  the  absorption  spectra  to  the  R-spectrum  fit  in  some  ideal  cases  (very  small 

resonant contribution to the refractive index, ultrathin resonant layers). It is confirmed that in 

the  case  of  ultrathin  resonant  layers  the  R-spectrum  shape  is  really  corresponded  to  the 

absorption spectrum for the angles in the total external reflection region. At the same time the 

requirement of a homogeneous low absorptive resonant media or of an ultrathin thickness of 

the resonant layer is hardly fulfilled for real samples. The restrictions for absorption approach 

to R-spectra are thoroughly analyzed. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the quantitative 

spectroscopic analysis of R-spectra should be done on the basis of the correct reflectivity theory.

1.  Reflectivity from a low absorption semi-infinite medium in the presence of a small resonant 

scattering in the total external reflection region 

For semi-infinite mirror with scalar susceptibility 

where  the  resonant  part 

  is  much  smaller  than  the 

nonresonant part 

, the Fresnel formula for the reflectivity amplitude

 ,                                                     (S1)

can  be  essentially  simplified  in  the  total  reflection  region,  where 

  is  large  enough 

compared with

the square roots in (S2) can be obtained: 

 ,                                                  (S3) 

So (S2) takes a form: 

 .            (S4)

external  reflection  region  on  the  imaginary  part  of  the  small  resonant  contribution  to  the 

refractive index.

4.  Reflectivity from an ultrathin resonant layer 

The reflectivity amplitude from an ultrathin resonant layer placed under a reflecting medium 

can be presented as (M. A. Andreeva and B. Lindgren, JETP Letters 76(12), 704(2002).): 

                                            (S24) 

where 

 is the reflectivity amplitude from an underlying substrate, 

 is the reflectivity 

amplitude  of  an  ultrathin  resonant  layer, 

  is  the  total  electric  field  at  the  position  of  the 

resonant layer.  

If 

  is  small  enough  the  expression  for  the  reflected  intensity 

  from  an 

ultrathin resonant layer above a substrate could be presented as:  

 .    (S25) 

After  separation  of  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  in 

, 

  and 

,  i.e.  presenting 

, 

 and 

, the calculations of the resonant addition to the 

total reflectivity give the following result: 

      (S26) 

Supposing  the  amplitude  of  the  incident  wave  equals  1,  and  replacing 

  in  (S26)  by 

 we get

Finally, the total reflectivity 

 from an ultrathin resonant layer placed under a substrate 

takes a form (formula (15) in the article): 

If 

 in (S26), (S27), is the Fresnel reflectivity amplitude from substrate, for separation of its 

real and imaginary parts the square root in (S2) should be presented in the form: 

(S28) 

 , 

                        (S29) 

where 

 and 

 characterize the susceptibility of the substrate 

. In (S29) 

the following notations are used: 

With these notations the reflectivity amplitude from a substrate (S2) can be rewritten in the 

form: 

.               (S30) 

  ,         (S31) 

where we designate

So, the real and imaginary parts of 

 are determined by the expressions: 

.                                           (S32) 

                                        (S33) 

Calculations of 

 with 

 from (S31) give: 

After simplifying the expression in the parentheses: 

 .          (S34) 

 , 

         (S35) 

the expression for 

 (S34) is reduced to 

Similarly, we calculate 

 coefficient with 

 from (S31): 

.                                  (S36) 

 . 

            (S37)

Taking into account that  

the expression for 

 (S37) gets the form:  

 . 

            (S38) 

,                                 (S39) 

               (S40) 

The expressions (S36), (S40) present the formulas (18), (19) in the article.
