ABSTRACT 

In this study,  we  investigate  the mobilization of  mucus in  a  cylindrical  tube of  constant  cross-

section  subjected  to  a  Small  Amplitude  Oscillatory  Shear  (SAOS)  assuming  the  viscoelastic 

behavior of mucus is described by the Oldroyd-B constitutive equation. The Laplace transform 

method was adopted to derive expressions for the velocity profile, average velocity, instantaneous 

flowrate and mean flowrate (i.e., mobilization) of the mucus within the tube. Additionally, a 2D 

finite element model (FEM) was developed using COMSOL Multiphysics software to verify the 

accuracy of the derived analytical solution considering both a Newtonian and an Oldroyd-B fluid. 

Furthermore,  sensitivity  studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  the  influence  of  the  vibration 

frequency,  vibration  amplitude,  mean  relaxation  time,  and  zero-shear  viscosity  on  mucus 

mobilization.  Results prove that the analytical and numerical results are within acceptable error 

tolerance and thus in excellent agreement. Besides, the parametric studies indicate a 48%, 57%, 

and  343%  improvement  in  mucus  mobilization  when  the  mean  relaxation  time,  vibration 

amplitude, and vibration frequency, respectively  were each increased by a factor of  6 from the 

assumed nominal values. Conversely, the mucus mobilization decreased by 25% when the zero-

shear viscosity was increased by a factor of 6 from the assumed reference value. In general, this 

study confirms that mucus mobilization in a tube can be improved by increasing the magnitude of 

vibration amplitude and vibration frequency. Similarly, the larger the magnitude of mucus mean 

relaxation  time  the  better  the  mucus  mobilization  when  the  tube  is  subjected  to  boundary 

vibrations. Finally, mucus mobilization decreases as the magnitude of mucus viscosity increases.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The effect of mechanical oscillations on the flow of viscoelastic and non-Newtonian fluids 

has garnered the attention of a plethora of researchers due to its numerous application in different 

industrial processes including pipe flow, secondary oil recovery, filtration, and fluid pumping  [1–

7].  Adequate understanding of the complex flow dynamics in these industrial processes is key to 

preventing  operational  challenges  and  optimizing  flow  processes  (i.e.,  reducing  total  power 

requirements,  and the  detrimental  effects  induced by sudden start-up or shut  down  during  pipe 

flow).  It  is  argued  that  varying  the  pump  or  valve  pulse  frequencies  in  pipes  helps  alleviate 

problems  related  to  sudden  start-up  or  shut  down  of  pipe  flows  [8–11].    Other  important 

applications of oscillatory fluid flow comprise acoustics propagation in biological organs (i.e., in 

the respiratory and circulatory systems of living beings).  

Understanding  the  biological-fluid  dynamics,  including  heartbeat,  stenosis,  and  mucus 

movement, is beneficial in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including cardiovascular and 

respiratory  diseases,  and  the  design  of  new  mechanical  systems  associated  with  the  biological 

systems  in  our  bodies  [12].  A  potentially  detrimental  example  of  cardiovascular  disease  is  the 

sudden blockage resulting from blood clots increasing blood pressure. The resulting increase in 

pressure typically leads to intracerebral hemorrhage due to the high pressure and shear stress on 

the vessels’ walls upstream of the blockage site and the oxygen deprivation on the downstream 

side [13]. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the atherosclerotic-plaques formation in carotid 

arteries and the associated shear stress in blood vessels is crucial for medical research, diagnosis, 

and  treatment  planning  [14–16].  Similarly,  Mucus  is  acknowledged  to  exhibit  non-Newtonian 

viscoelastic  properties,  and  numerous  studies  have  been  devoted  to  the  application  of  acoustic 

waves and mechanical oscillations to address respiratory airway clearance. Specifically, the mucus 

adherence and accumulation in the alveoli of COVID-19 patients exacerbate the already declining 

lung function by airflow reduction, airway obstruction, and respiratory failure, initiating COVID-

19-induced mortality [17–19].  Some of the devices created to achieve improved airway clearance 

 
 
3 

have  also  been  successfully  deployed  to  treat  cystic  fibrosis,  pulmonary,  neurological,  and 

neuromuscular diseases [20–22]. 

In general, non-Newtonian fluids may exhibit either finite yield stress, or shear-thinning, or 

thixotropy, or a combination of all these characteristics [23–25].  It has been presented in numerous 

studies that the shear modulus of some of these fluids is frequency-dependent and increases to a 

plateau as the oscillation frequency increases [26–28]. Stress application rate and its continuity, 

triggered by acoustic waves, alter the non-linear stress-strain curve of non-Newtonian fluids and 

their  elasticity,  resulting  in  an  improved  displacement  of  these  fluids[29].  The  mathematical 

literature in this field can be categorized into either analytical or numerical approaches. Analytical 

methods provide for rapid prototypes and better mechanistic/physical insight into the phenomena. 

Alternatively, numerical methods provide for a more comprehensive and robust investigation of 

physical problems since they require fewer assumptions in their development. 

 In 1963, Ting [30] derived the first exact solution of the non-Newtonian second-grade fluids 

flow in a cylinder. Subsequently, Srivastava [31], and Waters and King [32] provided the exact 

solutions, respectively for Maxwell and Oldroyd-B fluids.  The Maxwell constitutive relationship 

was presented as a simple mechanical model for describing viscoelastic materials that comprise a 

linear spring and a linearly viscous dashpot arranged in series [33,34]. Similarly, the Oldroyd-B 

model is popular in modeling non-linear fluids and is a three-dimensional generalization of the 

Maxwell model. This model takes into account the fluid incompressibility and its response when 

satisfying appropriate invariance requirements [35]. Rajagopal [36] presented the exact solutions 

for  both  an  incompressible  and  homogeneous  second-grade  fluid  and  studied  the  effects  of 

torsional and longitudinal oscillations in an infinite rod. Rajagopal and Bhatnagar [37] extended 

their original solutions  for  an  Oldroyd-B  fluid. Penton  [38] studied  the flow of  a viscous fluid 

initiated  by  an  oscillating  plate  and  provided  the  first  closed-form  transient  solution  for  this 

problem. Erdogan [39] using the Laplace transformation technique derived two starting solutions 

for the flow of a linearly viscous fluid  based on the cosine and sine oscillations of a flat plate.  

Their  solution  was  further  extended  to  non-Newtonian  fluids  using  the  second-grade  fluid, 

Maxwell, and Oldroyd-B models in the following literature just to name a few  [37,40–51]. 

Theoretical  predictions  show  that  perturbation  methods  on  viscometric  flows  (or  nearly 

viscometric  flows)  can  increase  the  flow  rate  as  a  function  of  frequency  and  amplitude  of 

 
4 

oscillations [4,5,52–59]. Mena et al. [4] using numerical and experimental procedures showed that 

a longitudinal vibration of the pipe wall strongly affects the flow in non-Newtonian fluids. The 

viscoelastic properties, shear-thinning behavior, and amplitude of the superimposed oscillations 

are the main parameters  of this phenomenon with elasticity as a secondary parameter. Herrera-

Velarde  et  al.  [57]  investigated  the  temperature  change  of  a  non-Newtonian  fluid  due  to  the 

oscillation of the pipe wall. Their results illustrate peaks in flow rate enhancement at specific wall 

shear stresses. Fetecau et al. [60] adopted the Fourier transform method to analytically investigate 

the effect of sidewalls on the flow of a viscous fluid over an oscillating infinite plate. Chen et al. 

[61] employed experimental and analytical methods to investigate the effect on the flow behavior 

of  a  cylindrical  rod  vibrating  in  a  cylindrical  shell  filled  with  viscous  fluid.  Duarte  et  al.  [62] 

investigated  the  flow  of  a  viscoelastic  fluid  both  in  pulsating  and  start-up  tests  using  upper-

convected Maxwell and Oldroyd-B fluid models. Kazakia and Rivlin [3,63] in two consecutive 

analytical studies investigated the effects of longitudinal, transverse, and rotational vibrations and 

their  combination  on  non-Newtonian  fluid  flow  in  a  pipe.  They  showed  that  when  the  fluid 

viscosity decreases due to the increase in the shear rate, the discharge rate of non-Newtonian fluid 

may increase with the vibration frequency and amplitude. The fluid flow in their works is assumed 

to  be  laminar.  Phan-Thien  [2]  also  provided  an  analytical  method  to  investigate  the  effect  of 

vibration on fluid flow. On the other hand, recent studies suggest employing specific fluid models, 

such as upper-convected Maxwell and Oldroyd-B, for non-Newtonian fluids. Hullender[7]  studied 

analytically the pre-transient and turbulent flow of an Oldroyd-B fluid in a circular pipe.  

Surprisingly, the effects  of vibration on the mucus movement, whether it is in conjunction 

with airflow or not, have not still been closely examined. Chang et al. [64] in their experimental 

and theoretical studies about mucus-air movement in airways demonstrated the significant effect 

of  shear  stress  at  the  air-mucus  interface  on  mucus  velocity.  Button  et  al.  [65]  reported  the 

effectiveness of cyclic compressive stress, chest percussion, and mechanical therapeutic devices 

in lung clearance of cystic fibrosis patients. In 1982, Radford et al. [66] reported altered mucus 

flow  rates  by  applying  percussion  energy  to  dogs’  and  humans’  chest  walls  with  the  optimal 

frequency range at 25-35 Hz. In 1983, King et al. [67,68] studied the mucus clearance in the trachea 

of nine anesthetized dogs using high-frequency chest wall compression. In their work, the tracheal 

mucus  clearance  rate  increased  with  the  most  pronounced  clearance  in  the  range  of  11-15  Hz 

oscillation, peaking at 13 Hz. Then, Gross  et al.  [69] also  reported improvements in peripheral 

 
5 

mucociliary clearance by applying high-frequency chest wall oscillation at a 13 Hz and a similar 

spontaneously breathing population and measurement technique in anesthetized dogs. Rubin et al. 

[70]  experimentally  found  that  a  low-energy  chest  wall  oscillator  (13  Hz)  improved  mucus 

clearance in central airways compared to a commercial chest percussor (40 Hz) in five anesthetized 

dogs. Ragavan et  al.  [71]  identified the significant  interactive impact  of tracheal  angles, cough 

velocities, oscillations, and simulant types on airway clearance during cough. The mucus simulant 

with high elasticity and cohesion displaced significantly longer distances at all cough velocities, 

at all angles of tracheal inclination with or without airflow oscillations compared with those of 

thinner  mucus  simulant.  Furthermore,  superimposed  flow  oscillations  of  25-68  Hz  had  a 

significant  influence  on  increasing  the  displacement  of  different  types  of  mucus  simulant.  The 

current  mathematical  investigations  and  studies  of  airway  clearance  using  high-frequency 

oscillation on chest walls require further development to better understand the mechanisms behind 

this phenomenon. This understanding is crucial and greatly beneficial to the COVID-19 patients, 

particularly because these treatment strategies are non-surgical and non-pharmaceutical.  

In  the  present  work,  we  aim  to  gain  an  in-depth  understanding  of  the  linear  viscoelastic 

response of mucous in a cylindrical pipe driven by a constant pressure gradient and superposed by 

mechanical oscillations/acoustics in the longitudinal direction. The pipe is considered to have a 

constant  cross-section  and  the  walls  are  perturbed  by  a  mechanical  oscillation(s)  at  a  specified 

frequency and amplitude. A 1D semi-analytical model is derived for this purpose, adopting the 

Oldroyd-B constitutive equation model for mucous and employing the Laplace transform method 

to derive semi-analytical expressions for the velocity field, average velocity, and volumetric flow 

rate of the mucus.  Laplace transformation plays  a  fundamental  role in  modeling  and analyzing 

numerous engineering design problems because it renders the problem of solving a linear constant-

coefficient differential equation to solving an algebraic equation that is easier to handle[72][73]. 

Furthermore, a 2D finite element model (FEM) is simultaneously developed using the viscoelastic 

module of the COMSOL 5.6 Multiphysics software to verify the accuracy of the semi-analytical 

solution.    Subsequently,  the  influence  of  the  relaxation  time,  polymer  viscosity,  vibration 

frequency,  and  amplitude,  on  mucus  mobilization  are  both  qualitatively  and  quantitatively 

examined by parametric studies. The results of this work will provide initial insights into the order 

of magnitude of mucus mobilization predicted by the Oldroyd-B linear viscoelastic constitutive 

equation as well as illustrate the transient response of mucous in vibrated media. To the best of our 

 
6 

knowledge,  none  of  the  previous  works  has  analytically  studied  the  transport  of  mucus  when 

mechanical acoustics are superposed on the walls. Therefore, we argue that this work can pave the 

way to designing devices that may help patients suffering from an accumulation of mucus in the 

lungs due to COVID-19.  

The agenda of this paper is enumerated as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of the flow 

problem  and  step-by-step  development  of  the  mathematical  model  in  the  radial-cylindrical 

coordinate system. The list of underlying assumptions required to arrive at the analytical solution 

and the expressions for the axial velocity, average velocity, and volumetric flow rate are presented 

in Section 3.  Besides, the finite element model (FEM) and mathematical equations numerically 

solved in COMSOL Multiphysics software are detailed in the remainder of Section 3. Section 4 

comprises two main sections; In Section 4.1, the semi-analytical solution is verified against the 

FEM model (Section 4.1) and in  Section 4.2, the results of the parametric study conducted are 

discussed in detail. The paper ends with some conclusions and remarks in Section 5. 

2.  THEORETICAL FORMULATION 

2.1. 

Derivation of Mathematical Model  

In the following, we present the theoretical description of the transient flow problem of mucous 

within  a  vibrated  tube  where  the  background  flow  is  driven  by  a  constant  pressure  gradient. 

Typically, such vibrations at the pipe wall, defined herein by 𝑢𝑊(𝑡), induce mechanical oscillation 

in the bulk fluid and micro-structures encountered in such rheological complex fluids. In reality, 

wall vibration in human flow passages may be triggered through a mechanical solicitation (e.g., 

clapping  of  the  chest  walls)[74]  or  mechano-acoustic  treatment  devices  (i.e.  acoustic 

percussion)[29],  to mention but a few. Figure (Fig.) 1 shows the schematic of the pipe with length 

𝐿 and radius 𝑅 where the pressures at the ends of the pipe are denoted by 𝑃𝐴 and 𝑃𝐵 are indicated. 

 
 
7 

Fig. 1 Schematic of the flow geometry  

Therefore,  the  fluid  transients  in  the  pipe  stem  from  the  net  pressure  drop  (∆𝑝)  in  the  pipe 

stemming from the pressure at the ends of the pipe and pressure due to gravity. The governing 

equations for non-Newtonian flow problems comprise the momentum equation (Navier Stoke), 

continuity equation, and an appropriate constitutive relationship between stress and shear rate. 

The Navier-Stokes and continuity equations in the vectorial form are expressed as follows: 

𝜌 (

𝜕𝑢

𝜕𝑡

+ 𝑢. ∇u) = −∇𝑝 + ∇. 𝜎 + 𝜌𝑔                                                                                (1) 

where 𝑝 represents pressure and 𝜌 is the mucous density and 𝑔 = 9.81 m/s2 is the gravitational 

acceleration.  

𝜕𝜌

𝜕𝑡

+ ∇. (𝜌𝑢) = 0                                                                                                              (2) 

Therefore, considering the cylindrical geometry  of the pipe, the governing equations describing 

the laminar motion of viscoelastic gel under unsteady-state condition comprise [7]:

where 𝑢𝑧 is the axial velocity, 𝜓 = 𝜌𝑔 +

𝑃𝐴−𝑃𝐵
𝐿

 or 𝜓 = 𝜌𝑔 for flow driven purely by gravity is the 

net  constant  pressure  gradient,  𝜎,  and  𝜌  define  the  axial  velocity,  net  pressure  gradient,  stress 

tensor, and fluid density respectively.  

Besides, 𝑢𝑧  is a function of 𝑟, 𝜎 is a function of 𝑟 and 𝑧; however, 𝑝 is assumed to be uniform at 
any  specific  𝑧.  Additionally,  to  aid  the  mobilization  of  mucous  within  the  tube,  longitudinal 
oscillations  are  introduced  at  the  pipe  wall.  The  velocity  of  the  wall  is  given  by  the  following 
relation: 

𝑢𝑊(𝑡) = 𝑢𝑧(𝑟, 𝑡)𝑟=𝑅                                                                        (5) 

where 𝑢𝑊(𝑡) is a general function of time that allows for easy Laplace transformation. 

Specifically, we consider two different expressions for the wall velocity in this research:  

𝑢𝑊(𝑡) = 𝑏0𝑡                                                                                                                    (6) 

𝑢𝑊(𝑡) = 𝐴𝜔 cos(𝜔𝑡 + 𝑏1)                                                                                              (7) 

Here,  𝑏0 is the acceleration coefficient, 𝑏1 is the phase angle,  𝐴 is the displacement amplitude 
and 𝜔 = 2𝜋𝑓 is the angular frequency of the vibration, and 𝑓 is the frequency of vibration. The 
choice of including the constant 𝑏1 (i.e., phase shift) in Eq. (7) is to cater for periodic functions or 
acoustic waves that do not necessarily start at the sinusoidal axis or a maximum or a minimum. 
Specifically,  this  allows  periodic  functions  with  the  same  amplitude  and  angular  frequency  to 
exhibit different starting points.  

Finally,  we  assume  the  stress  strain-rate  relationship  for  the  fluid  is  described  by  the 

Oldroyd-B tensor model[75] expressed as follows: 

[𝜎 + 𝜆1

𝜕𝜎

𝜕𝑡

] = 𝜇0 [

𝜕𝑢𝑧
𝜕𝑟

+ 𝜆2

𝜕2𝑢𝑧
𝜕𝑟𝜕𝑡

]                                                                                    (8) 

Here 𝜇0 is the zero-shear viscosity which  quantifies the viscous contribution, 𝜆1 is the relaxation 

time and 𝜆2 =

𝜇𝑠
𝜇0

𝜆1 is the retardation time. Besides, Eq. (8) reduces to the Maxwell constitutive 

equation when  𝜆2 = 0, and 𝐺 =

𝜇0
𝜆1

 is the elastic modulus which quantifies the elastic contribution. 

3.  MATHEMATICAL MODEL AND ITS SOLUTIONS 

3.1. 

Analytical Solution 

 
 
 
 
 
 
9 

In this section, the semi-analytical solution for the mathematical model developed in Section 3.1 
is  detailed  in  the  Laplace  domain.  Interested  readers  may  refer  to  Appendix  A  for  complete 
derivation.  

The following assumptions are considered to arrive at an analytical solution for laminar flow of 
mucus in a vertical smooth tube with a uniform cross-sectional area: 

a)  Flow is axisymmetric, and the fluid is assumed to be incompressible. 

b)  Isothermal fluid flow  

c)  The radial and azimuthal components of the fluid velocity are zero (i.e., purely axial flow) 

and thus neglect the pressure gradient and velocity components normal to the wall of the 

tube. Therefore, the contribution of the nonlinear term in Eq. (1) is negligible. 

d)  The viscoelastic behavior of mucus is described by the Oldroyd-B constitutive equation. 

e)  The mucus viscosity is assumed to be constant i.e., shear-thinning viscosity is neglected. 

3.1.1.  Velocity profile  

The transient flow field (i.e., velocity profile) within the tube in the Laplace domain given by Eq. 
(A-25) in Appendix A is: 

𝑈̂𝑧 = 𝑎1I0(𝑐𝑟) +

𝜓̂
𝜌𝑠

                                                                                                         (9) 

Where the coefficient 𝑎1 is defined in Eq. (A-26) as: 

 𝑎1 =

1
I0(𝑐𝑅)

(𝑈̂𝑊 −

𝜓̂
𝜌𝑠

)                                                                                                    (10) 

Substitution of Eq. (10) in Eq. (9) leads to: 

𝑈̂𝑧 =

I0(𝑐𝑟)
I0(𝑐𝑅)

𝑈̂𝑊 +

𝜓̂
𝜌𝑠

[1 −

I0(𝑐𝑟)
I0(𝑐𝑅)

]                                                                                      (11) 

where 𝑈̂𝑊 is defined as the Laplace transform of 𝑢𝑊. 

3.1.2.  Average velocity  

Assuming the flow passage is a circular tube with radius, 𝑅, the average velocity is calculated by  
the expression: 

𝑈̂𝑎𝑣 =

1

𝜋𝑅2 ∫ 2𝜋𝑟𝑈̂𝑧 𝑑𝑟 

𝑅
0

                                                                                                  (12) 

Substituting Eq. (9) in Eq. (12) results in 

 
 
 
𝑈̂𝑎𝑣 =

𝑅2 [𝑎1 ∫ 𝑟I0(𝑐𝑟) 𝑑𝑟 +

𝑅

]                                                                     (13) 

10 

Adopting integration by parts, Eq. (13) reduces to 

𝑈̂𝑎𝑣 =

2

𝑅2 [

𝑎1𝑅
𝑐

I1(𝑐𝑅) + (

𝜓̂
𝜌𝑠

)

𝑅2

]                                                                                      (14) 

For convenience, Eq.(14) can be expressed as 

𝑈̂𝑎𝑣 = [

2𝑎1
𝑐𝑅

I1(𝑐𝑅) +

𝜓̂
𝜌𝑠

]                                                                                                  (15) 

3.1.3.  Instantaneous and mean flowrate  

We define the instantaneous flowrate in the tube by the expression: 

𝑅
𝑄̂ = 2𝜋 ∫ 𝑟𝑈̂𝑧 𝑑𝑟 
0

                                                                                                          (16) 

Similarly, the substitution of Eq. (9) in Eq. (16) yields 

𝑅
𝑄̂ = 2𝜋 [𝑎1 ∫ 𝑟I0(𝑐𝑟) 𝑑𝑟 +
0

𝜓̂
𝜌𝑠

𝑅
∫ 𝑟 dr 
0

]                                                                       (17) 

Performing integration by parts, the instantaneous flowrate is governed by the expression: 

𝑄̂ = 𝜋 [

2𝑎1𝑅
𝑐

I1(𝑐𝑅) +

𝜓̂  𝑅2
𝜌𝑠

]                                                                                             (18) 

Similarly, we define the mean flowrate as the average of the instantaneous flowrate over a period 
of oscillation in the real-time domain by the expression[76]: 

𝑄𝑚 =

Summary  

In this paper, two different solutions for the flow of a viscoelastic fluid within a vibrated tube are 
presented.  Both  solutions  neglect  the  shear-thinning  property  of  the  viscosity;  however,  more 
nonlinear viscoelastic models such as the Giesekus model can easily be implemented using a FEM 
model to cater to the shear-thinning property of viscosity. Table 1 provides an overview of the key 
attributes of both solutions presented in this research.

4.  RESULT AND DISCUSSION  

The results and discussion section comprises of the following: In Section 4.1, the derived semi-
analytical  solution  is  validated  against  the  FEM  solution  obtained  from  the  COMSOL 
Multiphysics software for steady-state and transient flow synthetic problems.  Additionally, the 
remainder  section  (Section  4.2)  which  consists  of  four  sub-sections  presents  the  results  of  the 
parametric  analysis  conducted  to  illustrate  the  effects  of  the  vibration  frequency,  vibration 
amplitude,  mean  relaxation time, and  zero-shear  viscosity on the  flow  and mucus mobilization 
within the vibrated tube.

Validation of Solutions 

Herein, the accuracy of the derived analytical solution for  flow field in the vibrated cylindrical 
tube  was  verified  against  the  numerical  model  from  COMSOL  considering  both  the  static  and 
dynamic flow configurations. First, a stationary analysis is computed with no movement of the 
pipe wall considering both a vicious and viscoelastic fluid. Furthermore, a time-dependent analysis 
for a viscoelastic fluid is solved where the tube wall velocity is prescribed according to Eq. (6). 
Besides,  to  establish  the  accuracy  of  the  analytical  solution  we  neglect  the  shear-thinning  of 
viscosity in the FEM model. Table 2 enumerates the synthetic base-case input data utilized for 
validating the analytical and numerical solutions.

4.1.1.  Steady-State Solution 

The steady-state case was first solved considering a viscous fluid and a viscoelastic fluid for the 
limiting case of no wall movement (i.e., 𝑢𝑊 = 0). It is important to note that setting 𝜆1 = 𝜆2,  the 
Oldroyd-B constitutive equation reduces to a Newtonian fluid with a viscosity equal to the solvent 
viscosity 𝜇𝑠. Noting that the zero-shear viscosity is the addition of the polymer viscosity 𝜇𝑝 and 
𝜇𝑠 implies that 𝜇𝑝 = 0 for a Newtonian fluid. Furthermore, to arrive at the steady-state solution, 
we  set    𝑡 → ∞  for  the  analytical  solution.  The  velocity  profiles  generated  from  both  solutions 
considering a viscous fluid and a viscoelastic gel are shown in Fig. 3.

Each data point in the plot corresponds to the velocity at a given position along the pipe radius at 
steady-state  conditions.  As  expected,  Fig.  3(b)  indicates  that  the  velocity  profile  for  the 
viscoelastic elastic fluid is ~ 104 order of magnitude smaller than that of the Newtonian fluid in 
Fig. 3(a). Besides, an inspection of Fig. 3 reveals that there is reasonable overlap between both 
curves  for  both  fluids  providing  a  first-step  verification  of  the  derived  analytical  solution  and 
numerical model. Additionally, the average velocity and volumetric flow rate predicted from both 
solutions are in close agreement with a relative error of less than 1% as shown in Table 3.

4.1.2.  Unsteady State Solution with prescribed wall velocity 

The accuracy of the derived analytical solution was further verified against the numerical solution 
by performing a time-dependent analysis for an Oldroyd-B fluid where the tube wall velocity is 

 
 
 
 
 
 
15 

defined as a linear function of time i.e., Eq. (6). Applying the Laplace transform operator on the 
Eq. (6) leads to: 

𝑈̂𝑤 =

𝑠2                                                                                                                        (30) 

Adopting a linear function of time for the wall velocity, the flow behavior (i.e., velocity and flow 
rate) of the viscoelastic fluid predicted from both solutions are displayed in Fig. 4. 

Fig. 4 Model validation for a dynamic wall (a) axial velocity profile at 𝑡 = 0.005 s, (b) average 
velocity history, and (c) volumetric flow rate history 

The curves generated in Fig. 4 portray the velocity profile at an elapsed time of 0.005 s, and the 
average velocity and volumetric flow rate, respectively. The excellent overlap of the curves in the 
plot establishes that there is a close agreement between the derived analytical solutions and the 
FEM solution.   

Sensitivity Studies 

4.2. 
Herein, we investigate the transient flow behavior of mucus through a vibrated tube where the 
flow is driven by a combination of pressure and gravity. In addition, the axial velocity at the wall 

 
 
 
 
16 

of the tube is an oscillating function of time as defined in Eq. (7). The corresponding sinusoidal 
wall velocity in the Laplace domain is given by the expression:  

𝑈̂𝑤 = 𝐴𝜔 [

𝑠 cos(𝑏1)−𝜔 sin(𝑏1)
𝑠2+𝜔2

]                                                                                          (31) 

Additionally, to capture the viscoelastic behavior of human sputum, rheometric data representative 
of  the  healthy  range  of  human  lung  mucus  extracted  from  the  literature  was  utilized  as  input 
data[79]. Table 4 enumerates the data and corresponding fit using five Upper Convected Maxwell 
modes.

The contribution of the Giesekus parameter would be neglected in this study since the Oldroyd-B 
constitutive  equation  assumes  the  mucus  viscosity  is  constant  (i.e.,  shear-rate-independent). 
Besides, only the smallest relaxation time would be utilized to characterize the mucus.  Additional 
data  presented  in  Table  5  would  be  utilized  to  quantitatively  establish  the  effects  of  vibration 
frequency, vibration amplitude, relaxation time, and zero-shear viscosity on flow quantities (i.e., 
velocity and instantaneous flow rate, and mean flow rate).

4.2.1.  Sensitivity on the vibration frequency 

The magnitude of frequency denotes the number of vibrations (i.e., pressure peaks) perceived per 
second.  The  effect  of  frequency  on  the  vibrational  flow  of  mucus  was  investigated  by 
independently varying the frequency between 15 Hz to 90 Hz while keeping other inputs at their 
base  level  enumerated  in  Table  5.  As  shown  in  Fig.  5,  increasing  the  magnitude  of  vibration 
frequency leads to axial velocity curves shifted upwards (i.e., larger axial velocity values). 

Fig. 5 Effect of vibration frequency on the axial velocity profile 

Thus, Fig. 5 suggests that mucus transport within the tube improves as the magnitude of vibration 
frequency increases. To further establish this hypothesis, the average velocity, and instantaneous 

 
 
 
 
 
 
flow rate as a function of vibration frequency after four periods of the cosine wave are exhibited 
in Fig. 6.  

18 

Fig. 6 Effect of vibration frequency on (a) average velocity and (b) Instantaneous flowrate  

Evidently, Fig. 6 indicates that that the vibration frequency has a positive relationship with both 
the  average  velocity  and  instantaneous  flow  rate,  respectively  (i.e.,  the  average  velocity  and 
instantaneous flow rate increase with vibration frequency). For instance, the instantaneous flow 
rate is  7.36 × 10−9 m3/s, and  1.61 × 10−8 m3/s, when 𝑓 =  15  Hz, and  90 Hz, respectively.  
Furthermore, the effect of vibration frequency on the mean flow rate (i.e., mucus mobilization) 
was quantified and summarized in Table 6.

Of interest, Table 6 confirms that for a 𝐴 = 1.6 × 10−3 m, when the vibration frequency increased 
by a factor of 2 (i.e., from 15 Hz to 30 Hz) and a factor of 6 (i.e., from 15 Hz to 90 Hz), the mucus 
mobilization  improved  by  68%  and  343%,  respectively.  Consequently,  we  argue  that  a  linear 
viscoelastic constitutive model can predict a 68% improvement in mucous mobilization by only 
increasing the vibration frequency by a factor of 2 i.e., from 15 Hz to 30 Hz.   

4.2.2.  Sensitivity on the vibration amplitude  

The influence of the amplitude of vibration on the flow behavior including mucus mobilization 
was quantified by varying the amplitude values up to 1.6 × 10−3m while keeping other parameters 
fixed at their base values listed in Table 5.  As shown in Fig. 7, the axial velocity curves are shifted 
upward as the vibration amplitude increases.  

Fig. 7 Effect of vibration amplitude on the axial velocity profile 

Albeit it is important to specify that the curves are less spaced when compared to the plot generated 
in Fig. 5. Inspection of Fig. 7 suggests that higher vibration amplitude leads to larger axial velocity 

 
 
 
 
 
values along the radial cross-section. The average velocity and instantaneous flowrate as a function 
of vibration amplitude displayed in Fig. 8 were then estimated to validate this hypothesis. 

20 

Fig. 8 Effect of vibration amplitude on (a)average velocity and (b) instantaneous flowrate 

Fig.  8  establishes  that  both  the  average  velocity  and  instantaneous  flow  rate  exhibit  a  positive 
relationship  with  vibration  amplitude.  Specifically,  both  flow  quantities  increase  with  the 
magnitude of vibration amplitude. Consider Fig. 8(b), the instantaneous flow rate is 7.36 × 10−9 
m3/s,  8.58 × 10−9  m3/s,  9.92 × 10−9  m3/s,  11.46 × 10−9  m3/s,  13.39 × 10−9  m3/s,  and 
16.10 × 10−9  m3/s,  for 𝐴 = 0.1 × 10−3m,  0.2 × 10−3m,  0.4 × 10−3m,  0.6 × 10−3m  1.0 ×
10−3m, and 1.6 × 10−3m, respectively. Finally, the mucus mobilized as a function of vibration 
amplitude is enumerated in Table 7.

Table  7  confirms  that  at  𝑓 = 15  Hz,  increasing  the  vibration  amplitude  by  a  factor  of  2  (i.e., 

0.1 × 10−3m to 0.2 × 10−3m) and 6 (i.e., 0.1 × 10−3m to 0.6 × 10−3m) leads to 11% and 57% 

respectively, improvement in mucus mobilization.  Therefore, we argue that a significant increase 

in the amplitude of vibration is required for significant improvement in mucus mobilization.  

4.2.3.  Sensitivity on the mean relaxation time 

For viscoelastic fluids, the relaxation time characterizes the time taken for the fluid to return to an 
unperturbed (i.e., equilibrium) state following a deformation. Typically, large values of relaxation 
time  indicate  elastic  response  while  small  values  imply  a  viscous  response.  The  role  of  
𝜆̅
1  on  the  flow  behavior  and  mobilization  of  mucus  due  to  vibration  was  established  by 
independently varying the magnitude of 𝜆̅
1 < 3 s) over 4 periods 
of  the  cosine  wave.  The  plot  depicted  in  Fig.  9  indicates  that  when  boundary  vibrations  are 
introduced at the tube wall, the curves representing the axial velocity are shifted upwards as 𝜆̅
1 
increases.

22 

Fig. 9 Effect of mean relaxation time on the axial velocity  

Oscillation at the boundary wall leads to larger values of axial velocity in the tube as the elastic 
contribution to the overall material response increases. For example, the axial velocity at the pipe 
centerline equals 1.11 × 10−3 m/s, 1.70 × 10−3 m/s, and 5 × 10−3 m/s for 𝜆̅
1 = 0.089 s, 0.89 s, 
and 2.67 s, respectively. Therefore, neglecting the elastic contribution from a viscoelastic fluid 
will  lead  to  underpredicting  the  axial  flow  velocity.  The  relationship  between  mucus  average 
velocity and instantaneous flow rate as a function of 𝜆̅

1  are exhibited in Fig. 10.

23 

Inspection of Fig. 10 points that the average velocity and instantaneous flowrate exhibit a positive 
relationship  with    𝜆̅
1.  It  is  evident  from  Fig.  10  that  the  values  of  average  velocity  and 
instantaneous flowrate grow larger as 𝜆̅
1 increase in magnitude. For example, the average velocity 
is 0.59 × 10−3 m/s,  0.84 × 10−3 m/s, and 2.3 × 10−3 m/s for 𝜆̅
1 =  0.089  s, 0.89 s, and 2.67 s, 
respectively. Similarly, the instantaneous flowrate is 0.74 × 10−8 m3/s,  1.06 × 10−8 m3/s, and 
2.93 × 10−8 m3/s, for 𝜆̅
1 =  0.089  s, 0.89 s, and 2.67 s, respectively. Table 8 summarizes the 
mucus mobilized in the vibrated tube for the given values of 𝜆̅

Table 8 indicates that for a given vibration frequency and amplitude (i.e., 15 Hz and 1.6 × 10−3 
m),  a  larger  value  of  mucus  is  mobilized  within  the  tube  as  the  magnitude  of  𝜆̅
1  increases. 
Specifically,  a  9%  and  48%  improvement  in  the  mean  flow  rate  was  observed  when  𝜆̅
1was 
increased from 0.089 s to 0.178 s and from 0.089 s to 0.534 s, respectively. Therefore, we argue 
that as the elastic contribution of mucus increases due to chronic lung infection or inflammation, 
the mucus clearance efficiency can be improved via introducing boundary oscillations.  

4.2.4.  Sensitivity on the zero-shear viscosity 
Viscosity is a measure of the resistance to deformation of fluid at the flow condition and it 
quantifies  material  response  for  viscous  fluids.  It  is  important  to  recall  that  for  the  linear 
viscoelastic theory, the viscosity is independent of shear rate and is quantified by the zero-shear 
viscosity. The axial velocity profile as a function of radial distance after 4 periods of the cosine 
wave is illustrated in Fig. 11.

Fig. 11 Effect of zero-shear viscosity on the axial velocity profile  

As shown in Fig. 11, the curves are shifted downwards as the magnitude of 𝜇0 increases. Take, for 
example, the axial velocity at the tube centerline equals 0.931 × 10−3 m/s,  0.314 × 10−3 m/s, 
and  0.238 × 10−4  m/s,  for  𝜇0 = 11.001 Pa∙s,  44.001 Pa∙s,  and  66.001  Pa∙s,  respectively. 
Therefore,  the  mucus  transport  within  the  tube  decreases  as  the  mucus  viscosity  increases.  To 
further validate this hypothesis, the average velocity and instantaneous flowrate of mucus within 
the tube as a function of 𝜇0 are shown in Fig. 12.

Fig. 12 Effect of zero-shear viscosity on (a) average velocity and (b) volumetric flowrate 

Observation of Fig. 13 confirms that both the average velocity and instantaneous flow rate display 
a negative trend with 𝜇0. Specifically, we note that the average velocity and instantaneous flowrate 
diminish as viscosity magnitude increases.  For instance, the average velocity is 5.40 × 10−4 m/s, 
2. 01 × 10−4 m/s, and 1.63 × 10−4 m/s for 𝜇0 =  11.001  Pa.s, 44.001 Pa.s, and 66.001 Pa.s, 
respectively.  While  the  instantaneous  flowrate  is  6.79 × 10−9  m3/s,    2.52 × 10−9  m3/s,  and 
2.05 × 10−9 m3/s, for 𝜇0 =  for 11.001  Pa.s, 44.001 Pa.s, and 66.001 Pa.s, respectively. The 
effect of mucus viscosity on mucus mobilization (i.e., mean flow rate) after four periods of the 
cosine wave is quantified in Table 8.

Table  9  indicates  that  for  a  given  value  of  vibration  frequency  of  15  Hz  and  amplitude  of 
1.6 × 10−3 m, a 15% and 26% decrease in mucus mobilization were estimated by increasing the 
viscosity by a factor of 2 (i.e. 11 Pa.s to 22 Pa.s) and 6 (i.e., 11 Pa.s to 66 Pa.s), respectively.  

5.  CONCLUSION 
In  this  paper,  a  semi-analytical  solution  for  the  Poiseuille  flow  of  mucus  in  a  vibrated 
cylindrical tube was derived by adopting the Laplace transform method on the governing partial 
differential  equations.  The  derived  expressions  for  the  velocity  field,  average  velocity, 
instantaneous  flowrate,  and  mean  flowrate  were  subsequently  utilized  to  examine  the  transient 
flow response and mobilization of mucus due to the sinusoidal oscillations at the tube wall. It is 
important to highlight some of the key advantages of the proposed analytical solution includes its 
convenience for rapid prototyping due to speed, stability, and accuracy since numerical solutions 
for  viscoelastic  flows  sometimes  fail  to  converge  especially  for  high  Weissenberg  numbers. 
Besides,  the  presented  analytical  solution  provides  a  convenient  tool  for  experimenting  with 
different wall velocity expressions (i.e., sinusoidal, non-sinusoidal, and other novel functions). The 
only condition is that the proposed wall velocity function satisfies the conditions for applicability 
of  Laplace  transform  (i.e.,  the  function  must  be  locally  integrable  for  the  interval  [0, ∞]). 
Furthermore,  the  analytical  solution  allows  for  studying  viscoelastic  flows  driven  by  time-
dependent pressure gradients which may stem from airflow due to coughing [82], and pulsating 
pressure gradients. The main findings from this research are outlined as follows:  

1.  The vibration frequency exhibits a positive relationship with both the average velocity and 
instantaneous flow rate. Analysis indicated that the mucus mobilized in the tube improved 
by 68% and 343% when the vibration frequency was increased by a factor of 2 (i.e., 15 Hz 
to 30 Hz) and 6 (i.e., 15 Hz to 90 Hz), respectively. 

2.  The  vibration  amplitude  displays  a  positive  trend  with  the  average  velocity  and 
instantaneous flowrate. Besides, mucus mobilization increased by 11% and 57% when the 
vibration  amplitude  by  a  factor  of  2  (i.e.,  0.1 × 10−3m  to  0.2 × 10−3m)  and  6  (i.e., 
0.1 × 10−3m to 0.6 × 10−3m), respectively.   

3.  The  mean  relaxation  time  depicts  a  positive  correlation  with  the  average  velocity  and 
instantaneous  flow  rate.    Results  indicated  that  for  a  frequency  of  15  Hz  and  vibration 
amplitude of 1.6 × 10−3 m, mucus mobilization improved by 9% and 48% when the value 
of 𝜆̅
1was increased by a factor of 2 (i.e., 0.089 s to 0.178 s) and a factor of 6 (i.e., 0.089 s 
to 0.534 s), respectively. 

4.  The average velocity and instantaneous flow display a negative trend with the zero-shear 
viscosity. Numerical experiments indicated that mucus mobilization decreased by 15% and 
26% when the zero-shear viscosity was multiplied by a factor of 2 (i.e. 11 Pa.s to 22 Pa.s) 
and 6 (i.e., 11 Pa.s to 44 Pa.s), respectively.

8.  APPENDIX A: DERIVATION OF ANALYTICAL SOLUTION 

The analytical solution to the flow in a vibrated tube is arrived at employing the Laplace transform 

method defined by the expression

Where ℒ and 𝑠 are the Laplace transform operator and Laplace variable. 

The Laplace transform of Eqs. (3) and (4) respectively yields

where  𝑈̂𝑧, 𝜓̂ =

  and  𝜎̂  are  the  axial  velocity  field,  pressure  gradient,  and  stress  tensor  in  the

Given the assumption of zero initial condition i.e. 𝑢𝑧(0) = 0, Eqs. (A-2) and (A-3) reduces to

Applying the operator ℒ on Eq. (8) and simplifying leads to 

𝜎̂ = 𝜇0ℎ(𝑠) 𝑑𝑈̂𝑧

                                                                                                              (A-6) 

where ℎ(𝑠) denotes the normalized Oldroyd-B shear stress transfer function defined by 

ℎ(𝑠) = [

It is important to note the following: 

1)  At 𝜆2 = 0 the stress-shear rate constitutive relation reduces to the Maxwell model. 
2)  At  𝜆2 = 𝜆1 the stress shear rate constitutive equation reduces to a Newtonian fluid with 

viscosity 𝜇0. 

To  arrive  at  the  expression  for  the  flow  field,  we  combine  the  momentum  equation  with  the 
Oldroyd-B stress relation as follows 
[𝑟𝜇0ℎ(𝑠) 𝜕𝑈̂𝑧

Inspection  of  Eq.  (A-12)  reveals  a  second-order  non-homogenous  differential  equation  with  a 
general solution comprising the complementary and particular solutions as follows: 

𝑈̂𝑧 = 𝑈̂𝑧𝐶 + 𝑈̂𝑧𝑃                                                                                                           (A-14)

The Eq. (A-16) is a modified Bessel equation with a solution  

𝑈̂𝑧𝑐 = 𝑎1I0(𝑐𝑟) + 𝑎2K0(𝑐𝑟)                                                                                       (A-16) 

Where 𝑎1 and 𝑎2 are coefficients to be obtained from the specified boundary conditions, and 𝑗 is 
the notation for √−1, I0(. ) and K0(. ) are the modified Bessel functions of the first and second 
kind with order 0. 

Employing the method of undetermined coefficients, the particular solution of Eq. (A-14) yields

                                                                                                                       (A-17) 

Substituting Eqs. (A-16) and (A-17) into Eq. (A-14) leads to

                                                                                  (A-18) 

The boundary conditions in Laplace space can be expressed as follows: 

𝑈̂𝑧 =   𝑈̂𝑊      at 𝑟 = 𝑅                                                                                                 (A-19) 

And

Recall the following properties of the modified Bessel functions

Additionally, we have that

Therefore, applying the operator

 on Eq. (A-18) results in 

𝜕𝑈̂𝑧

Employing the boundary condition at 𝑟 = 0 in Eq. (A-23) yields 

𝑎2 = 0                                                                                                                           (A-24)  

Therefore, Eq. (A-18) simplifies to: 

 𝑈̂𝑧 = 𝑎1I0(𝑐𝑟) +

                                                                                                      (A-25) 

Similarly, at 𝑟 = 𝑅,  combining Eq. (A-25) and Eq. (A-19) leads to the expression 

𝑈̂𝑊 = 𝑎1I0(𝑐𝑅) +

𝜓̂

                                                                                                   (A-26) 

Therefore, the coefficient, 𝑎1 is defined as
