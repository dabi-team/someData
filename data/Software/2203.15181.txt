ABSTRACT

Supernovae emit large ﬂuxes of neutrinos which can be detected by detectors on Earth. Future
tonne-scale detectors will be sensitive to several neutrino interaction channels, with thousands of
events expected if a supernova emerges in the galaxy neighborhood. There is a limited number of
tools to study the interaction rates of supernova neutrinos, although a plethora of available supernova
models exists. EstrellaNueva is an open-source software to calculate expected rates of supernova
neutrinos in detectors using target materials with typical compositions, and additional compositions
can be easily added. This software considers the ﬂavor transformation of neutrinos in the supernova
through the adiabatic Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein eﬀect, and their interaction in detectors through
several channels. Most of the interaction cross sections have been analytically implemented, such
as neutrino-electron and neutrino-proton elastic scattering, inverse beta decay, and coherent elastic
neutrino-nucleus scattering. This software provides a link between supernova simulations and the
expected events in detectors by calculating ﬂuences and event rates to ease any comparison between
theory and observation. It provides a simple and standalone tool to explore many physics scenarios
oﬀering an option to add analytical cross sections and deﬁne any target material.

1. INTRODUCTION

Supernovae (SNe) are one of the most intriguing and least known phenomena in the universe.

In this process,
approximately 3 × 1053 erg of energy are emitted in form of neutrinos of all species in the energy range of MeV,
which represent 99% of the total released energy (Lunardini 2006). Questions that are still open in neutrino physics
such as their Dirac or Majorana nature (Barranco et al. 2020), their masses (Lu et al. 2015), the hierarchy between
the masses (Serpico et al. 2012; Dighe & Smirnov 2000), and the neutrino magnetic moment (Ando & Sato 2003),
are the motivation of current scientiﬁc research and could be solved by studying the high neutrino ﬂuxes arriving
to Earth from nearby SNe events. Current and future neutrino detectors, such as SNO+ (Albanese et al. 2021),
Super-Kamiokande (Ikeda et al. 2007), KamLAND (Eguchi et al. 2003), HALO (Duba et al. 2008), JUNO (An et al.
2016), and Hyper-Kamiokande (Abe et al. 2018), are capable of detecting the neutrino ﬂux coming from a supernova
(SN) explosion in the Milky Way galaxy or the galactic neighborhood. Such neutrinos can also be detected on dark
matter detectors through the process coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) (Horowitz et al. 2003; Lang
et al. 2016). This represents an invaluable opportunity for exploring neutrino properties and SN physics. On the other
hand, there is a community of researchers dedicated to simulating the SN neutrino ﬂux (Janka 2022), considering many
parameters and variables. The EstrellaNueva software has been created to provide a link between the SN simulations
and the expected observed signal in detectors. EstrellaNueva is a ﬂexible and simple standalone tool that is valuable
to promptly perform several studies when a SN takes place in the galaxy neighborhood.

The software package has several SN models implemented, the adiabatic Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein (MSW)
(Dighe & Smirnov 2000; Giunti & Wook 2007; Xu et al. 2014) eﬀect for neutrino ﬂavor transformation in the SN matter,
and the analytical cross sections of the principal detection channels in current and future detectors. Another important
and unique feature of this software is the option to design any target material. EstrellaNueva allows calculating the

ﬂuences of the neutrinos coming from SNe, interaction rates, and total number of interactions with the target particles
of the detectors. These characteristics are valuable for performing comparisons of events observed by detectors that
are either currently operating or under design and construction.

In addition to EstrellaNueva, other software tools to study supernova neutrinos exist, but are generally not as
simple to use and require additional software packages. For example, SNEWPY (Baxter et al. 2022) requires an event
rate calculator or an event generator such as sntools (Migenda et al. 2021), while SNOwGLoBES (Scholberg et al.
2020) requires the GLoBES (Huber et al. 2005, 2007) software to perform the event rate calculations. EstrellaNueva
provides all in a single package without requiring any other interface, and also provides an analytical implementation
of the cross section functions and the option to input target materials with any chemical composition. This advantage
makes possible the implementation of any SN model and any neutrino interaction in the detector. The modular
implementation also makes it suitable to study other neutrino ﬂavor scenarios, not only in the SN, but also when the
neutrino propagates on Earth. The software currently considers ﬂavor transformation via the adiabatic MSW eﬀect
in the SN.

In this manuscript, the EstrellaNueva software is presented with a description of the SN models used and the neu-
trino physics implemented, with some examples of its ﬂexibility and simplicity. The followings sections are organized
as follows: Section 2 shows the software structure; Section 3 describes a general overview of the implemented physics;
Section 4 shows the implemented SN models; Section 5 presents the analytically implemented cross sections of the
detection channels and the implemented nuclear form factors for the case of CEνNS interaction; Section 6 shows two
examples of the conﬁguration ﬁle setup; ﬁnally Section 7 presents the conclusions.

2. SOFTWARE STRUCTURE

EstrellaNueva is open-source software written in Python designed to complement the supernova simulations, by
calculating the interaction rates as well as the number of events in detectors.
It was built using NumPy (Harris
et al. 2020) and SciPy (Virtanen et al. 2020): two well-optimized Python modules that oﬀer excellent tools to process
large volumes of data and perform scientiﬁc calculations. It also uses the Python module Mathplotlib (Hunter 2007)
to plot the output functions as well as some of the implemented functions such as cross sections and nuclear form
factors. The software is available in the Zenodo repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6354850 (Gonz´alez-Reina
& V´azquez-J´auregui 2022).

The software package, stored in the directory “EstrellaNueva”, contains the following items:

• The main ﬁle “EstrellaNueva.py”: main script to execute the software. This Python script uses Python 3 as inter-
preter, from the directory “EstrellaNueva”. The command line for execution is: “python3 EstrellaNueva.py”.

• The conﬁguration ﬁle “conﬁg.json”: JSON ﬁle for setting the conﬁguration parameters, before executing the

main script.

• The sub-directory “data”: contains the data of the supernova models, as well as some of the implemented cross
sections which were taken from the SNOwGLoBES (Scholberg et al. 2020) repository in form of data ﬁles. These
cross sections correspond to the interactions with 12C, 16O, and 208Pb.

• The sub-directory “out”: will contain the output ﬁles once the code is executed. The output consists of data

ﬁles with the number of interactions per channel, interaction rates, and ﬂuences.

• The sub-directory “src”: contains the EstrellaNueva libraries. The cross sections implemented analytically are

located in this directory.

• The sub-directory “doc”: contains the user manual.

The input requested by the code is:

• the supernova model,

• the neutrino mass ordering 1

1 The neutrino mass ordering is considered for the adiabatic MSW eﬀect in the supernova matter. Flavor transformations can also be turned

oﬀ.

• the distance to the supernova,

• the mass of the active volume of the detector and chemical composition of the material, and

• the detection channels;

and the output is:

• the interaction rates with respect to the incoming neutrino energy and time, in addition to the recoil particle

energy, for the case of elastic scattering interactions,

• the ﬂuences, and

• the total number of interactions.

3. FLAVOR TRANSFORMATION AND EXPECTED INTERACTION RATE

Most SN simulations report the time dependence of the neutrino ﬂux at the neutrino-sphere. At this location inside
the SN, it is assumed neutrinos can travel freely, without further diﬀusing with the SN matter due to their small
interaction cross sections. The neutrino ﬂux is assumed to be quasi-thermal in this sphere and can be parameterized
by the following expression as a function of the neutrino energy E and the SN time t (the elapsed time taking the
origin at the core bounce) (Keil et al. 2003; Serpico et al. 2012):

F 0

ν (E, t) = Lν(t)

where Lν is the luminosity, (cid:104)Eν(cid:105) is the neutrino mean energy, βν is the so-called energy-shape parameter, and ν
represents the neutrino states νe, νµ, ντ , ¯νe, ¯νµ, and ¯ντ . The energy-shape parameter is given by

βν(t) =

which quantiﬁes how close the neutrino spectrum is to the black-body spectrum, as a function of time (Serpico et al.
2012). The primary ﬂuxes at the neutrino-sphere F 0
ν will be aﬀected by neutrino ﬂavor transformation on their path
through the SN matter. One of the most common and accepted scenarios is the adiabatic MSW eﬀect, which has been
implemented in the EstrellaNueva framework.

An ultrarelativistic left-handed neutrino, born at the neutrino-sphere, with ﬂavor α (α = e, µ, τ ) and momentum (cid:126)p,

is described by the ﬂavor eigenstate

In Equation (7), δαe is the Kronecker delta, VCC and VN C are the eﬀective potentials due to the charge current (CC)

In the Schr¨odinger picture, a neutrino state with initial ﬂavor α obeys the evolution equation

when they are produced. The rotated eﬀective Hamiltonian Hrot
F allows one to construct the level diagrams shown in
Figure 1, for a given neutrino energy value (Dighe & Smirnov 2000). During the ﬁrst second of the burst of neutrinos
from a SN, in typical SN density proﬁles (model independent), the neutrino evolution can be considered adiabatically
(Xu et al. 2014). This means that the transition probability between eﬀective matter eigenstates can be neglected.
Then, a neutrino born in an eﬀective matter eigenstate will remain in this state during its path through the SN
matter, until reaching the vacuum, where |νkm(cid:105) → |νk(cid:105). Therefore, taking into account the mixing of the neutrinos
and following the level diagrams shown in Figure 1, the neutrino ﬂuxes in vacuum, considering the neutrino normal
mass ordering (NO), can be written as a linear combination of the primary ﬂuxes at the neutrino-sphere,

The neutrino interaction rates in a detector on Earth are determined for the ﬂavour ﬂuxes Fν emitted by the SN as

given in Equations (16) and (17). The number of interactions per unit time and energy is

the total cross section as a function of the incoming neutrino energy for a given interaction channel. Here is useful to
deﬁne a magnitude so-called ﬂuence, which is the time-integrated ﬂux at Earth and provides the energy spectrum of
the incoming neutrinos:

In Equation (19), (t0; tend) is the time interval of the SN process. Integrating Equation (18), the interaction rates with

primary ﬂux parameters at the neutrino-sphere, namely Lν(t), (cid:104)Eν(cid:105)(t), and (cid:104)E2
ν (cid:105)(t). The time dependence of βν is
calculated by EstrellaNueva following Equation (2). These models were simulated with the PROMETEUS-VERTEX
code (M¨uller et al. 2010; Serpico et al. 2012) using three diﬀerent equations of state: the equation of state (EoS) of
Lattimer and Swesty (Lattimer & Douglas Swesty 1991), with a nuclear incompressibility of 220 MeV, denoted by
LS220; the Shen EoS (Shen et al. 1998); and the SFHo hadronic EoS (Steiner et al. 2013). Implemented SN models
are described in Table 1, where the time intervals in which they were simulated are also shown. As an example,
Figure 2 shows the time dependence of the primary ﬂux parameters for the model LS220-s15.0, which corresponds to
a progenitor of mass 15.0 M(cid:12) (M(cid:12) is the mass of the Sun) and was simulated using the LS220 EoS. Figure 3 shows
the ﬂuences for this model at a distance to the SN equal to 10 kpc, considering the MSW eﬀect with NO, IO, and
neglecting the neutrino ﬂavor transformation in the SN matter. For ﬂuence calculations, the entire time interval of
the model was used.

In addition, it is possible to deﬁne a simple and time-independent SN model in the EstrellaNueva software. This is
assuming the primary ﬂux parameters constant in time. In this scenario, the ﬂuences of the primary ﬂuxes are given

5. DETECTION CHANNELS

EstrellaNueva has implemented the cross sections of the principal detection channels for materials employed by cur-
rent and future detectors, such as water, argon, xenon, lead, and mineral liquid scintillators. In addition, the software
provides the ﬂexibility to deﬁne materials with any chemical composition. The detection channels implemented are:
ν − e elastic scattering, ν − p elastic-scattering, inverse beta decay (IBD), coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
(CEνNS), and the interactions with 12C, 16O, and 208Pb. The last three were taken from the SNOwGLoBES repository
(Scholberg et al. 2020) in the form of data ﬁles and the rest were implemented analytically. The implementation of
analytical cross sections is one of the main features provided by this software package.

2015), is

6. CONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLES FOR ESTRELLANUEVA

The EstrellaNueva software is a standalone code that does not require any more dependencies other than the Python
modules that were used for its programming. The modules are Numpy (Harris et al. 2020), Scipy (Virtanen et al.
2020), and Mathplotlib (Hunter 2007). These modules are required in the Python3 environment.

In this section, two examples of the conﬁguration ﬁle are presented to calculate interaction rates. The SN model
LS220-s15.0, presented in Sec. 4, is used as example, with the distance to the SN assumed at 10 kpc and considering
the full SN simulation time interval. The ﬂuences regarding this conﬁguration for the neutrino ﬂavor transformation
scenarios implemented (adiabatic MSW eﬀect with normal and inverted neutrino mass ordering, and no neutrino
ﬂavor transformation) are shown in Figure 3.

6.1. Interaction rates for ν − e elastic scattering in a 100 kton detector using liquid scintillator

In this example, the interaction rates for ν − e elastic scattering are calculated for a 100 kton generic detector with
linear alkylbenzene (LAB). LAB is used as a target medium by the SNO+ experiment (Albanese et al. 2021) and
it will be used by the future JUNO experiment (Cao et al. 2019). LAB is a material internally predeﬁned in the
software, although any chemical composition can be deﬁned in the conﬁguration ﬁle. The conﬁguration to compute
the interaction rates, considering normal neutrino mass ordering (NO), is as follows,

0.000.250.500.751.001.251.501.752.00T (MeV)10−1110−910−710−510−310−1F2HelmSFKNEstrellaNueva

This example corresponds to the event rates calculated for CEνNS in 100 tonnes of liquid argon, considering a
chemical composition of pure 40Ar. Argon is also predeﬁned internally. CEνNS interactions are not aﬀected by ﬂavor
transformations and they are turned oﬀ in this case. The results do not change if ﬂavor transformations are included.

7. CONCLUSIONS

Several detectors all over the world are currently expecting the emergence of a supernova. Thousands of events are
expected in current operating neutrino detectors. Simple, ﬂexible, standalone, and independent tools are valuable and
will be useful when such a cosmic event takes place. The EstrellaNueva software provides a user-friendly tool to study
neutrinos and supernova properties by calculating the number of events in detectors. Several detection channels are
currently implemented, the majority with analytical functions, such as neutrino-electron and neutrino-proton elastic
scattering, inverse beta decay, and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering with the Helm, Klein-Nystrand, and
symmetrized Fermi nuclear form factors. The adiabatic MSW eﬀect for the neutrino ﬂavor transformations in the
supernova matter is also implemented. EstrellaNueva considers several supernova models simulated by the Core-
