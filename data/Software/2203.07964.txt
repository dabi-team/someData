Simulated Detector Performance at the Muon
Collider

Submitted to the Proceedings of the US Community Study
on the Future of Particle Physics (Snowmass 2021)

Abstract
In this paper we report on the current status of studies on the expected
performance for a detector designed to operate in a muon collider
environment. Beam-induced backgrounds (BIB) represent the main challenge
in the design of the detector and the event reconstruction algorithms. The
current detector design aims to show that satisfactory performance can be
achieved, while further optimizations are expected to signiﬁcantly improve
the overall performance. We present the characterization of the expected
beam-induced background, describe the detector design and software used for
detailed event simulations taking into account BIB effects. The expected
performance of charged-particle reconstruction, jets, electrons, photons and
muons is discussed, including an initial study on heavy-ﬂavor jet tagging. A
simple method to measure the delivered luminosity is also described. Overall,
the proposed design and reconstruction algorithms can successfully
reconstruct the high transverse-momentum objects needed to carry out a
broad physics program.

Executive Summary

Despite the success of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, several observations point to the
existence of physics beyond what is currently known. Theoretical explanations of such phenomena most
probably require new states or forces that manifest at energies higher than what is currently accessible
at world leading facilities. The lack of a ﬁrm indication of the exact energy scale of those phenomena
further motivates an energy frontier research program capable of reaching to the highest possible energy.
In the landscape of possible future energy-frontier accelerators, a circular µ+µ− collider, also referred to
simply as muon collider, is a particularly attractive option for the future of energy frontier exploration.
Such a machine has the potential to deliver a vast physics program [1] in a relatively compact accelerator
complex.

The aim of this paper is to describe the expected performance of a multi-purpose Muon Collider
Detector (MCD) designed to reconstruct the products of a muon-muon collisions with high accuracy.
Several operating center-of-mass energies are possible for the considered machine; in this paper a center-
of-mass energy of 1.5 TeV is explored.

One of the biggest challenges for a MCD is to successfully disentangle the products of the µ+µ−
collisions from an intense beam-induced background (BIB) coming primarily from secondary and ter-
tiary interactions of the muon decay products. For this reason an essential part of the Machine Detector
Interface (MDI) at a Muon Collider is a pair of tungsten nozzles cladded with borated polyethylene,
which reduce the rate and energy of BIB particles that reach the detector by several orders of magnitude.
The nozzles limit the maximum angular acceptance of the MCD to about 10◦ from the beamline axis.

The MCD design presented in this paper follows the classical cylindrical layout typical for multi-
purpose detectors of symmetric collisions. It consists of a silicon-based Vertex Detector, with innermost
barrel layer at 22 mm from the beamline, followed by silicon-based Inner and Outer Trackers. High
granularity electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and an outer muon spectrometer complement the
main elements of the detector.

A detailed GEANT4 based simulation package is used to simulate the response of the detector.
A fast digitization and detailed reconstruction algorithms were developed to study the expected perfor-
mance of the MCD in the event reconstruction. The BIB is overlaid to the µ+µ− process of interest.

Three approaches are studied for track reconstruction at the MCD: a Conformal Tracking (CT)
algorithm developed for the clean environment of the electron-positron colliders and supplemented with
either a Region of Interest approach or a ﬁlter based on double pixel layers in the innermost layers of
the detector, and a Combinatorial Kalman Filter (CKF) algorithm developed for the busy environment of
hadron colliders. The results show a robust track reconstruction for charged particles with the momentum
above 1 GeV throughout the detector acceptance, with the potential for extending towards softer particles.
Jets are reconstructed using a particle-ﬂow approach and a kT-based clustering. An energy calibra-
tion is derived and applied throughout the studies. The performance is evaluated on samples of light, b−
and c−jets, resulting in a reconstruction efﬁciency ranging from 82% at pT ≈ 20 GeV to 95% at higher
pT with sub-percent fake rate in the region |η| < 1.5. The jet energy resolution ranges from about 50%
to about 15%, depending on pT. The resulting di-jet invariant mass resolution allows good separation
between hadronically-decaying Higgs and Z bosons.

A simple heavy-ﬂavor tagging based on ﬁnding a displaced-vertex yields a b−jet identiﬁcation
efﬁciency ranging from 50% to 80%, depending on pT, with a mis-tag rate of about 1 − 5% (20%) for
light (c-)jets. It is expected that more advanced algorithms would be able to perform signiﬁcantly better.

Prototypes of electron and photon reconstruction algorithms able to cope with BIBs have been
developed, yielding a successful reconstruction of high-pT electrons and photons with relatively small
loss of efﬁciency and energy resolution. Muon reconstruction is performed by combining a stand-alone
track reconstructed in the muon system and a track reconstructed in the tracker. BIBs mostly affect the
forward endcap region. Filtering hits based on their properties as well as based on standalone muon

5

tracks allows for negligible impact of BIB in the performance of muon reconstruction. Reconstruction
of other high-pT objects, as τ leptons, is still in progress, but it is expected to pose challenges similar
to the ones that have been already solved for track and jet reconstruction as well as heavy-ﬂavor jets
identiﬁcation.

The precise determination of the delivered luminosity is of crucial importance for the planned
physics program. A method based on µ−Bhabha scattering measurement shows that a statistical preci-
sion of about 0.2% can be achieved for the integrated luminosity delivered per year of data-taking.

In conclusion, this manuscript uses detailed simulation of a proposed Muon Collider detector that
satisﬁes the basic requirements of reconstructing high-pT objects needed to deliver an ambitious physics
program. The effects of BIB is taken into account, showing that its impact can be successfully mitigated.

Introduction

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has been an extremely successful theory to describe mea-
surements at the energy frontier. In the last decades, a vast physics programs at the energy frontier has
produced discoveries that led to the current incarnation of the Standard Model (SM) theory and stress-
tested it with precision measurements. Nevertheless, observations, as well as theoretical motivations,
unambiguously point to physics phenomena Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Theoretical explana-
tions of such phenomena almost always require new states or forces that manifest at energies higher
than what currently accessible at world leading facilities. Despite the lack of a clear energy target that
guarantees with certainty a discovery, multiple indirect indications point to energy scales of several TeV
as the most likely energy regime where BSM phenomena would manifest. It is therefore of paramount
importance to develop a physics program for the energy frontier that allows us to explore such an energy
regime in the future, possibly with the ability of adapting the target energy depending on future insights
from accelerator and non-accelerator based experiments.

In the landscape of possible future energy-frontier accelerators [2], a circular µ+µ− collider, also
referred to simply as muon collider, is a particularly attractive option for the future of energy frontier
exploration [3]. Such a machine has the potential to deliver a vast physics program [1,4–40] in a relatively
compact accelerator complex [41]. Such an option has been studied in the past [42–49], and it sparked
renewed interest thanks to advances in accelerator technology as well as given the current needs of high-
energy exploration of the ﬁeld.

The aim of this paper is to describe the expected performance of a multi-purpose muon collider
detector (MCD). The study focuses on the reconstruction algorithms and performance of high-pT objects
that will be used needed for a successful physics program. The results are built upon and signiﬁcantly
extend the ones reported in Ref. [50]. The current design aims at showing that satisfactory performance
can be achieved in a muon collider environment. Further optimization of the detector design and recon-
struction algorithms are expected to signiﬁcantly improve the performance of a MCD and will be subject
of future work.

Several operating center-of-mass energies are possible for a future muon collider [41]. In this

accelerator parameters that have been assumed for the simulations used for the results presented in this
manuscript. Most of the results presented in this manuscript do not simulate the spread of collisions in
the transverse and longitudinal directions, unless otherwise stated; it is expected that this has a minor

One of the biggest challenges for a MCD is to successfully disentangle the products of the µ+µ−
collisions from an intense beam-induced background (BIB) coming primarily from secondary and ter-
tiary interactions of the muon decay products [51–53]. Section 2 summarizes the main characteristics
expected for such a background and also includes a discussion on the expected background composition

for higher center-of-mass energy muon colliders.

BIB has a big inﬂuence on the detector design, which is summarised in Section 3. The technical
challenges for the MCD and the most promising technologies for fulﬁlling the physics requirements
of the detector are described in a separate manuscript [54], which also covers the readout and trigger
schema.

Results in this manuscript are obtained using detailed simulations of the MCD based on a Geant4 [55]

framework. The software setup is described in Section 4. All simulations, unless otherwise stated, in-
clude overlaying on top of the desired µ+µ− collision the model of BIB described in Section 2.

Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 describe the reconstruction algorithms and expected performance for the
basic objects needed to carry a comprehensive physics program. Reconstruction of other objects, as τ
leptons or missing momentum, is still in progress, but it is expected to pose challenges similar to the ones
that have been already solved. A method for measuring the delivered luminosity with high accuracy is
described in Section 9.

2 Beam-Induced Background characterization

The unstable nature of muons (lifetime τµ = 2.2 µs at rest) makes the beam-induced background (BIB)
a much more challenging issue at a Muon Collider than it is at facilities that use stable-particle beams.
In fact, 2 · 1012 muons per bunch in a 750 GeV muon beam lead to about 4 · 105 muon decays per
meter. Interactions of the decay products with the accelerator lattice produce even larger amounts of
particles that eventually reach the detector, making the reconstruction of clean µ+µ− collision events
nearly impossible without dedicated BIB mitigation. A discussion of the expected radiation levels due to
BIB can be found in Ref. [54]. For this reason an essential part of the Machine Detector Interface (MDI)
at a Muon Collider is a pair of tungsten (W) nozzles cladded with borated polyethylene (BCH), which
reduce the rate and energy of BIB particles reaching the detector by several orders of magnitude.

A dedicated design of the MDI has been developed by MAP collaboration [52] using the MARS15
software [56] to simulate muon decays within ±200 m from the interaction point (IP) in a collider ring
with the parameters summarised in Table 1. The exact shape and positioning of the nozzles was optimised
s = 1.5 TeV case, including the 10° opening angle and 12 cm distance between the
speciﬁcally for the
tips of the nozzles, as shown in Fig. 1. The same approach has been adopted by the Muon Collider
collaboration based on the FLUKA simulation software to characterize BIB at higher center-of-mass
energies and to study other MDI designs.

√

In order to include the effects of the BIB on detector performance the particles induced by the
muon decays are collected at the outer surface of the MDI and before entering the detector volume,
which is represented by a black box on Fig. 1. This allows to later simulate their interaction with the
detector together with particles from the µ+µ− collision. Thus, BIB sample in this article refers to the
collection of particles originating from the muon decays before any interaction with the detector material.

2.1 BIB properties at 1.5 TeV

√

s = 1.5 TeV presented in this paper
The exact BIB sample used for detector-performance studies at
has been produced in MARS15 software, because the FLUKA-based workﬂow was not fully validated at
that time. Yet FLUKA interface is used for visualisation of the accelerator geometry and BIB trajectories
in the MDI region thanks to its advanced graphical capabilities. An example of simulated particle decays
and their interaction with the accelerator lattice is shown in Fig. 2, demonstrating multiple points along
the beamline where BIB particles originate from.

BIB particles at a Muon Collider have a number of characteristic features that set them apart
from typical backgrounds at e+e− or pp colliders, namely their low momentum, displaced origin and
asynchronous time of arrival. Distributions of these three properties are presented in Fig. 3 for the three
dominant particle types exiting from the MDI surface: neutrons, photons and electrons/positrons.

ration for the
colours represent different materials of the MDI: tungsten (green), borated polyethylene (violet), iron
(mustard), concrete (gray). The black box in the center encloses the detector volume, which is excluded
from the standalone BIB simulation process. Dimensions are reported in centimeters.

The most distinctive aspect of BIB particles at the Muon Collider is their extremely large number
and low momentum: about 4 · 108 particles exiting the MDI in a single bunch crossing depositing energy
to the detector in a diffused manner. The separation between the tips of the tungsten nozzles leads to
most of the BIB particles exiting at a signiﬁcant distance from the interaction point. Finally, there is a
substantial spread in the arrival time of the BIB particles with respect to the bunch crossing, ranging from
a few nanoseconds for electrons and photons to microseconds for neutrons due to their smaller velocity.

Each of these aspects has different implications for the BIB signatures in different parts of the
detector, which depend on the position, spatial granularity and timing capabilities of the corresponding
sensitive elements. Thus, a careful choice of detector technologies and reconstruction techniques allows

to mitigate the negative effects of the BIB, as demonstrated in the later sections of this paper.

2.2 Simulation in FLUKA

√

s = 1.5 TeV by the Monte Carlo
We report in this section the most relevant BIB features computed at
multi-particle transport code FLUKA [57,58]. The complex FLUKA geometry is assembled by means of
the LineBuilder [59] using the optics ﬁle provided by the MAP collaboration. The accelerator elements
have been deﬁned in Fluka Elements Database following the information contained in this ﬁle and in
MAP publications [60, 61]. The results obtained by FLUKA are benchmarked against those provided by
the MAP collaboration and the detailed comparison is described in Ref. [53].

The results presented below are computed for one beam, given the symmetric nature of the µ+µ−
collider. In particular, the primary µ− beam is simulated according to parameters reported in Table 1
travelling counterclockwise starting 200 m away from the IP.

The major contributors to BIB are photons, neutrons and electrons/positrons. The time at which
BIB exits the machine in the IR is spread over a wide range but the major part is concentrated around the
beam crossing time (t = 0), as shown by the top panel of Fig. 4.

The bottom panel of Fig. 4 reports the longitudinal distribution of primary µ− decays generating
the most relevant BIB families: the cumulative function shows it is enough to consider decays within
∼ 25 m from the IP. On the contrary, simulations show that to correctly account for the secondary µ±, it
is necessary to consider primary decays up ∼ 100 m from the IP.

The kinetic energy distribution of most relevant BIB particle types is reported in Fig. 5. Energy
cutoffs have been applied in the simulation at 100 keV for γ, e±, µ±, charged hadrons and at 10−14 GeV
for neutrons. The nozzles act in a very signiﬁcant way in cutting out the high energy BIB component:
as we can notice the BIB particles entering the detector hall have kinetic energy below few GeVs. Only
charged hadrons and secondary muons can reach much higher energies but their number is quite low, in
the order of 104 and 103, with respect to 107 photons, neutrons and 105 electrons, positrons.

Most of the BIB exits the machine in the region around the IP and by considering a time cut within
-1 and 15 ns, which is the most relevant for the detector measures, a big portion of photons and neutrons
is removed, as displayed by the left panel of Fig. 5.

3 Overview of the Detector design

The Muon Collider Detector (MCD) follows the classical cylindrical layout typical for multipurpose
detectors of symmetric collisions and the speciﬁc geometry used for simulation studies in this work has
the reference code MuColl_v1. The rendering of the detector geometry is presented in Fig. 6, with the
dimensions of each subsystem summarised in Table 2. A cylindrical coordinate system is used with its
centre placed at the nominal interaction point. The Z axis is deﬁned as the moving direction of the µ+
beam. The X axis is deﬁned to point towards the inner part of the ring and the Y axis therefore pointing
upwards. Cylindrical coordinates are often used with R, θ and φ denoting the radial distance from the
interaction point, the polar and azimuthal angles respectively. Pseudo-rapidity η = − log (cid:2) tan(θ/2)(cid:3) is
also used in some cases for convenience.

Starting from the Be beampipe with a radius of 22 mm, the Vertex Detector is the closest to the IP
with its innermost layer having a radius of only 30 mm. It is followed by the Inner and Outer Trackers.
The three sub-systems complete the all-silicon Tracking Detector, which operates in the strong magnetic
ﬁeld of 3.57 T provided by the superconducting solenoid, to reconstruct trajectories and transverse mo-
menta (pT) of charged particles. High-granularity sampling ECAL and HCAL calorimeters are arranged

respectively, with ﬁne longitudinal segmentation: 40 layers in ECAL and 60 layers in HCAL. Outside of
the superconducting solenoid is the Muon Detector based on RPC technology with its iron yoke closing
the magnetic ﬁeld. It is worth noting that accurate timing information from all sub-systems is an essential
component of the detector, as it allows rejecting a large fraction of BIB.

The design of the MuColl_v1 detector is largely based on the CLICdet geometry developed
by CLIC collaboration, with the details about technologies used for each component documented in
Ref. [62]. The only subsystem with signiﬁcant changes to its design is the Tracking Detector, which is
described in the following.

3.1 Tracking Detector

The tracking detector is assumed to follow the typical design of an all-silicon tracker. The geometry is
shown in Fig. 7. It consists of three sub-detector; the Vertex Detector, Inner and Outer Trackers. All
three are split into a central barrel section and a forward end-cap section. The Vertex Detector is made
from 4 double-layers with a 2 mm gap to improve secondary vertex resolution. The forward coverage is
limited by the presence of the tungsten nozzle shield.

The Tracking Detector returns 4-dimensional hit coordinates; the three positional dimensions and
precision timing information. The timing information plays a critical role in reducing the effective hit
density from BIB. Fig. 8 shows the timing distribution (corrected for time-of-ﬂight) of hits from a µ+µ−
collision compared to those induced by BIB. The spatial and timing resolutions assumed in the detector
simulations are summarized in Table 3.

no difference between the barrel and end-cap regions.

4 Detector Simulation Software
Full simulation of a single µ+µ− collision event involves several stages:

1. generation of all stable particles entering the detector;
2. simulation of their interaction with the passive and sensitive material of the detector;
3. simulation of the detector’s response to these interactions;
4. application of data-processing and object-reconstruction algorithms that would happen in a real

experiment.

The ﬁrst stage of generating stable input particles is handled by standalone software, such as
Monte Carlo event generators for the µ+µ− interaction and FLUKA or MARS15 for the BIB particles.
The rest of the simulation process is performed inside the iLCSoft framework [63] previously used by
the CLIC experiment [64] and now forked for developments of Muon Collider studies [65]. Particle
interactions with the detector material are simulated in GEANT4 [55], while detector response and event

using the DD4hep detector description toolkit [67], which provides a consistent interface with both the
GEANT4 and Marlin environments. More detail about the software structure and computational opti-
mization methods used for simulating such a large number of BIB particles is documented in Ref. [68].

4.1 Detector digitization

Response of each sensitive detector to the corresponding energy deposits returned by GEANT4 is simu-
lated by dedicated digitization modules implemented as individual Marlin processors.

The Tracking Detector uses Gaussian smearing to account for the spatial and time resolutions
of local hit coordinates on the sensor surface and the time coordinate. The assumed resolution values
are listed in Table 3. Acceptance time intervals, individually conﬁgured for each sub-detector, are used
for replicating the ﬁnite readout time windows in the electronics of a real detector and to reject hits
from asynchronous BIB particles. The result of this simpliﬁed approach is one-to-one correspondence
between the GEANT4 hits and digitized hits, which ignores the effect of charge distribution across larger
area due to the Lorentz drift and shallow crossing angles with respect to the sensor surface. These effects
are taken into account in the more realistic tracker digitization code that is currently under development
and will allow stronger BIB suppression based on cluster-shape analysis.

ECAL and HCAL detectors are digitized using realistic segmentation of sensitive layers into cells
by summing all energy deposits in a single cell over the conﬁgured integration time of ±250 ps. Time
of the earliest energy deposit is consequently assigned to the whole digitized hit. The same digitization
approach is used also for the Muon Detector.

5 Charged particle reconstruction

In the magnetic ﬁeld of MCD a charged particle will follow a helix trajectory aligned with the Z axis. The
radius of curvature in the transverse plane is proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld (3.57 T) and the transverse
momentum of the particle. Deviations from a perfect helix can occur due to multiple-scattering, ionizing
energy losses and bremsstrahlung. The ﬁrst two are a direct function of the detector material. The amount
of radiation lengths that a particle traverses through the tracking detector when starting from the nominal
collision point is shown in Fig. 9.

The charged particle trajectory is reconstructed from hits positions in the silicon tracking detector.
The reconstructed object is called a track. A track consists of a set of hits (one per layer) and ﬁve ﬁtted
parameters describing the helix. A track reconstruction algorithm can roughly be broken up into two
steps: pattern recognition to identify the hits belonging to a single track and ﬁtting the hit coordinates by
a track model to deduce the relevant track parameters.

Track reconstruction at the Muon Collider is complicated by the presence of a huge number of
hits in the silicon sensor originating from the Beam Induced Background (BIB-hits). The density of BIB
hits is ten times larger than the expected contribution from pile-up events at a High Luminosity LHC
detector. Table 4 compares the hit density between the MCD and ATLAS Inner TracKer (ITk) upgrade
for HL-LHC operation [69, 70]. The increase in possible hit combinations creates a challenge for the hit
pattern recognition step. It is crucial to reduce the amount of hits at the input to a track reconstruction
algorithm through alternate means, such as precision timing information. The BIB hits are out-of-time
with hard collision hits after the time-of-ﬂight correction has been applied. By applying a −3σ/ + 5σ
time window, the hit density can be reduced by a factor of two as seen in Fig. 10.

The spatial distribution of BIB-hits is also unique. They are different from hits created by pile-up.
Pile-up hits come from real charged particle tracks originating from multiple vertices in the collision
region. On the other hand, BIB-hits come from a diffuse shower of soft particles originating from the
nozzles. The compatibility of a track with a trajectory originating from the luminous region provides an
important handle for differentiating "real" tracks of charged particles produced in the primary collision

and "fake" tracks generated from random combinations of BIB-hits.

The remainder of this section describes three approaches that were studied for track reconstruc-
tion at the MCD. The ﬁrst two use the Conformal Tracking (CT) algorithm developed for the clean
environment of the electron-positron colliders [71]. However in the presence of BIB, the CT algorithm
takes weeks to reconstruct a single event and is impractical for large-scale production of simulated data.
To ease the computational effort, the input hits are ﬁrst reduced by either deﬁning a Region of Interest
(Section 5.1) or by exploiting the double-layered Vertex Detector to select only hit pairs pointing to the
collision region (section 5.2). The third approach (Section 5.3) uses the Combinatorial Kalman Filter
(CKF) [72–74] algorithm developed for the busy environment of hadron colliders. It can perform track
reconstruction in a reasonable time without requiring any additional ﬁltering of input hits.

It should be noted that the CT and CKF algorithms have very different software implementations
that are responsible for much of the difference in their performance. The CKF algorithm is implemented
using the A Common Tracking Software (ACTS) [75] library that is heavily optimized for efﬁcient com-
puting. The same is not true for the CT algorithm implemented directly in iLCSoft with less emphasis
on computational efﬁciency. It is possible that part of the computational improvements come from code
quality alone. For example, the ACTS Kalman Filter implementation is a factor 200 faster than the de-
fault iLCSoft implementation given the same inputs. This demonstrates the advantage of an experiment-
independent track reconstruction library developed by a dedicated team with strong computing expertise.

The expected performance is assessed using a sample of single muons originating at the interaction

point. BIB-hits are overlaid, unless explicitly noted. Two set of samples are used; one set is generated
with the muon having a ﬁxed momentum (p) of 1, 10 and 100 GeV and a uniform distribution in θ.
The second set is generated at discrete values of θ = 13◦, 30◦, 89◦ and uniform transverse momentum
distribution in the 1 − 100 GeV range. The chosen θ values correspond to particles expected to leave
hits entirely in the endcap system, some in the barrel and some in the endcap, and entirely in the barrel
region, respectively.

5.1 Conformal Tracking in Regions of Interest

The Conformal Tracking algorithm is based on Ref [71] and implementation in iLCSoft. The algorithm
is designed and optimized to ﬁnd charged particles in very clean environments, as the ones in e+e−
colliders. The conformal mapping technique [76] is combined with cellular automaton approach [77] to
increase the acceptance of non-prompt particles.

Due to the very large hit multiplicity from BIB-hits, running such an algorithm for the full event is
prohibitive in terms of CPU and memory resources. Instead a region-of-interest approach is used, where
hits to be considered are pre-selected based on existing objects reconstructed in either the calorimeters
or the muon system. To assess tracking performance only hits within a cone of ∆R < 0.5 around the

signal muon were selected as input to the CT algorithm, where ∆R =

(cid:113)

∆φ2 + ∆η2.

Fig. 11 (left) shows the reconstruction efﬁciency as a function of pT; a muon is considered recon-
structed if at least half of the hits associated to the track have been originated by the muon. Optimal
reconstruction efﬁciency is achieved throughout the pT spectrum, with a somewhat smaller efﬁciency for
very forward particles due to their proximity with the nozzle and much larger expected occupancy in the
region. The latter is expected to be recovered by a more dedicated tuning of the algorithm or by using
one of the algorithms described in the next sections.

Fig. 11 (right) shows transverse momentum resolution as a function of polar angle θ. The resolu-
tion is computed by comparing reconstructed and generated pT and shown divided by p2
T. A localized
degradation of the resolution can be seen around θ ≈ 35◦, corresponding to the barrel-endcap transition;
in addition, the feature is enhanced by the non-physical lack of spread of the muon originating point. It
is expected that a more realistic simulation of the luminous region as well as future optimizations of the

tracker layout will mitigate such localized degradation to negligible levels.

Fig. 12 shows the resolution on the impact parameter D0 (left) and the resolution on the lon-
gitudinal impact parameter Z0 (right) as a function of the polar angle θ. Similarly to the case of the
resolution on pT, the resolution on D0 and Z0 slightly degrades in the barrel-endcap transition region,
around θ ≈ 35◦.

5.2 Conformal Tracking with Double Layers

The Vertex Detector is constructed using double-layers (DL). A double-layer consists of two silicon
detector layers separated by a small distance (2 mm for MCD). This concept will also be used by the
CMS Phase-II tracking detector [78] to reduce the hit combinatorics for a fast track reconstruction in
their trigger system.
It works by selecting only those hits that can form a pair with a hit from the
neighboring layer that in aligned with the interaction point (IP). If there is no 2nd hit in the double-layer
to form a consistent doublet the hit is discarded. This approach is particularly effective for rejecting BIB
hits, because BIB electrons are very likely to either stop in the ﬁrst layer due to their very low momentum,
or to cross the double-layer at shallow angles, creating doublets that are not aligned with the IP. The DL
ﬁltering implemented in our simulation software is based on the angular distance between the two hits of
a doublet when measured from the interaction point, as demonstrated in Fig. 13. For simplicity the two
variables used for ﬁltering are the polar (∆θ) and azimuthal (∆φ) angle differences.

20

Fig. 13: Illustration of the doublet-layer ﬁltering used for the rejection of BIB-induced hits in the Vertex
Detector. Horizontal black lines represent double layers of pixel sensors that are crossed by signal (green)
and BIB (grey) particle tracks. Hit doublets created by a signal particle are perfectly aligned with the
beamspot position, but have a sizeable angular difference when measured from the center of the detector.
Hit doublets created by BIB particles are characterized by larger angular difference due to their shallow
crossing angle and more displaced origin.

In practice there are several limitations to the precision of alignment that can be imposed by the
DL ﬁltering while maintaining high efﬁciency for signal tracks. The ﬁrst is driven by the ﬁnite spatial
resolution of the pixel sensors, which limits the minimum resolvable displacement between the two hits
of a doublet.

Its position needs to be known beforehand and any uncertainty will result in an inefﬁciency. The
latter point is also important for displaced particles (ie: secondary vertices of b-mesons) that do not
originate from the IP.

For simplicity the two variables used for ﬁltering are the polar (∆θ) and azimuthal (∆φ) angular
distances. Fig. 15 shows the distributions of ∆θ and ∆φ in single-muon events with a realistic beamspot
in the ﬁrst layer of the vertex detector. The distribution in other double-layers for p = 1 GeV muons are
shown in Fig. 14. The bi-modal nature of the ∆φ distribution for low energy muons is the result of the
circular path that charged particle take in the transverse plane. This biases DL ﬁltering toward charge
particles with higher pT unless very loose cuts are used.

Table 5 lists the two operating points (loose and tight) used to ﬁlter hits for the CT algorithm in

two stages. Fig. 16 shows the hit multiplicity (mostly BIB-hits) as a function of VXD layer.

The loose working point targets high efﬁciency reconstruction of p > 1 GeV muons with the
realistic beamspot size (Fig. 15). It reduces the number of hits in the innermost double-layer by a factor
of two. This reduces the CT reconstruction time from ≈ 1 week/event to ≈ 2 days/event. While
signiﬁcant, this is still not practical for sample production. Instead the loose working point is used with a
special CT conﬁguration as a ﬁrst stage of a two-stage reconstruction process. The ﬁrst stage reconstructs
high-pT tracks to precisely determine the IP position, which can be used for

The tight working point is optimized for the scenario when the interaction point is precisely known
(Fig. 14). It has a hit survival rate of ≈ 2% in the inner-most layer. This reduces the hit multiplicity
enough for the CT algorithm to complete in ≈ 2 min/event. It is used as the second stage of the track
reconstruction algorithm, with the IP determined from the ﬁrst-stage.

The two-stage doublet-layer ﬁltering provides a computationally viable method to track recon-
struction in the presence of the BIB. However its efﬁciency is very limited for reconstructing non-prompt
particles, including b-meson decays.

5.3 Combinatorial Kalman Filter

The Combinatorial Kalman Filter (CKF) algorithm seeded using hit triplets was implemented using the
ACTS library v13.0.0. The implementation is a Marlin Processor that serves as a drop-in replacement
for the existing tracking Processors. In addition to providing an alternate algorithm designed for large

hit multiplicity, ACTS also provides a heavily optimized code for fast computation. The triplet seeding
+ CKF used in this section reconstructs tracks at the rate of 4 min /event. It provides the ﬁrst practical
and comprehensive tracking solution for the MCD.

The seeds for the CKF algorithm are formed from hit triplets in the four layers of the Vertex
Detector. Only hits in the outer half of doublet layer are considered. Several heuristics are use to
determine if each triplet is compatible with a track and can be used as a seed. The seeding algorithm is
conﬁgured using the ACTS default values, with the exception of

– radial distance between hits is between 5 mm and 80 mm,
– minimum estimated pT is 500 MeV,
– maximum forward angle of 80°,
– extrapolated collision region is within 1 mm of detector center,
– average radiation length per seed is 0.1,
– allowed amount of scattering is 50 σ,
– the middle hits in each seed are unique.

This conﬁguration has not been fully optimized. For example, the size of the collision region is
smaller than the expected beam-spot size. Also one needs to explore the use of the Outer Tracker for
seeding. Its lower BIB-hit multiplicity can allow the loosening of some requirements.

23

Fig. 17: Seed ﬁnding efﬁciency for events containing a single muon with BIB overlay for several deﬁni-
tion collision region ("rough z0") as a function of truth pT(left) and λ (right).

Around 150,000 seeds are found per event. The efﬁciency of the seeding algorithm is shown in
Fig. 17. Seeds are found for more than 90% of the muons with pT>2 GeV. Loosening the collision
region deﬁnition increases the amount of fake seeds and reduces the seed ﬁnding efﬁciency due to the
seed overlap removal. The latter can be addressed, at a cost in run time, by allowing multiple seeds to
share the same middle hit.

The CKF is run inside-out, meaning that the track extrapolation starts from the inner-most seed hit
and continues outward in the radial direction. The initial track parameters are estimated from the seed.
The CKF algorithm has only two tunable parameters that are set as follows;

– maximum one (closest) hit added at each layer,
– hit search window at each layer of 10 χ2.

As with the seeding algorithm, these values are not optimized. The consideration of only a single
hit at each layer means that the CKF algorithm will not branch to consider multiple track candidates for
a single seed. This seems very tight, however a good tracking reconstruction efﬁciency is still seen. This
underlines the difference between BIB and pile-up; the BIB-hits are a "random" background that is not
compatible with the trajectory of a track.

Fig. 18 shows the track reconstruction efﬁciency as a function of particle pT and θ for single muon
events with p = 10 GeV. Muons with pT > 2 GeV are reconstructed with 90% efﬁciency or greater even
in the presence of BIB. There is a considerable amount of fake tracks (≈ 100, 000 per event). Fig. 19
compares the pT distribution and the associated number of hits between real and fake tracks. Fake tracks
are mostly at low pTand are associated with a signiﬁcantly smaller number of hits. The latter further
underlines the randomness of the BIB-hits and provides a handle for reducing the fake rate.

Fig. 20 shows the track reconstruction efﬁciency in a sample containing Higgs bosons decaying
to two b-quarks. This is a practical demonstration CKF performance on a realistic event. Maintaining
a good track reconstruction efﬁciency as a function of production radius is important for identifying
secondary vertices of b-mesons. The tight conﬁguration maintains above 70% efﬁciency up to 5 mm.
While not perfect, it is a signiﬁcant improvement over the inefﬁciency of doublet-layer ﬁltering required
for CT.

6 Jets

Hadronic jets are fundamental objects in a Muon Collider experiment. As an example, the measurements
of the tri-linear and quadri-linear Higgs couplings rely on the reconstruction and identiﬁcation of b jets
from the Higgs boson decay, as the dominant decay signature of the Higgs boson is into b-quarks pair,

with a branching ratio of 58%. Jet reconstruction is one of the most difﬁcult reconstruction tasks at a
Muon Collider, since almost all sub-systems are involved, and the impact of the BIB is signiﬁcant in all
of them, with different features in different sub-detectors. The jet reconstruction algorithm employed is
described in this section, and its performance is discussed. The algorithm has been designed to recon-
struct jets in the presence of the BIB, but it is far from being fully optimized, and further studies are
needed in the future. However we are going to demonstrate that even at this stage the jet reconstruction
can achieve a decent performance. Given the high level of details of the full simulation (including the
BIB impact) this give us the conﬁdence that measurements with jets are possible at a Muon Collider,
and further dedicated advancements on MDI, detectors and reconstruction algorithms would go in the
direction of improving the physics reach. The algorithm works as follows:

1. tracks are reconstructed using the Combinatorial Kalman Filter algorithm and are ﬁltered depending

on the number of hits in the sub-systems;

2. calorimeter hits are selected by requiring a hit time window and an energy threshold;
3. tracks and calorimeter hits are used by the PandoraPFA algorithm to obtain reconstructed particles;
4. the reconstructed particles are clustered into jets with the kt algorithm;
5. requirements are applied to remove fake jets;
6. a jet energy correction is applied.

The jet performance has been evaluated on simulated samples of b¯b, c¯c and q ¯q dijets, where q stands for

6.1 Track ﬁlter

Tracks are reconstructed using the Combinatorial Kalman Filter algorithm described in Section 5.3.
Since more than 100k fake tracks per event are found in this way, they are ﬁltered depending on the
number of hits in the Vertex Detector and Inner Tracker. In Fig. 21 hit distributions for tracks from b-jets
and BIB are compared. A number of Vertex Detector hits greater than 3 and a number of Inner Tracker
hits greater than 2 are required for each track, reducing the average number of BIB combinatorial tracks
per event from more than 100k to less than 100.

6.2 Calorimeter hit selection
Calorimeter hits are ﬁltered depending on the normalized hit time, deﬁned as tN = t − t0 − cD, where t
is the absolute hit time, t0 is the collision time, c is the speed of light, and D is the hit distance from the
origin of the reference system. A time window of ±250 ps is applied to remove most of the BIB hits but
preserving the signal, as can be seen in Fig. 22. As rule of thumb we can assume that a time window of
width ∆ is applicable if the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the cell time resolution is below
∆/3. Therefore, in this particular case, we assume a FWHM of at least 167 ps, that should be achievable
by state-of-the-art calorimeter technologies.

Several calorimeter hit energy thresholds have been tested, in order to reduce hits produced by

BIB. It has been found that a threshold of 2 MeV applied to both ECAL and HCAL is a compromise
between jet performance and computing time. In fact this requirement reduces the average number of
ECAL Barrel hits from 1.5M to less than 10k. The computing time of the jet algorithm exponentially
grows with the number of calorimeter hits, therefore with the current resources we are not able to reduce
the thresholds far below 2 MeV. However the impact of reducing the thresholds at the close value of 1
MeV is described in Section 6.7.

6.3 Particle ﬂow, jet clustering and fake jet removal

Calorimeter hits and tracks are given as input to the PandoraPFA algorithm, that produces as output
reconstructed particles known as particle ﬂow objects. The PandoraPFA algorithm is described in detail
in [79]. Then particle ﬂow objects are clustered into jets by the kT algorithm. A cone radius of R = 0.5
is used.

At this point an average number of 13 fake jets per event is reconstructed, which need to be
removed by applying additional quality criteria. The number of tracks in the jet has been found to be the
most discriminating feature between b-jets and fake jets, as shown in Fig.23 (left).

It can be seen that most of the fake jets from BIB have no tracks associated to them. Therefore,
requiring at least one track allows to greatly reduce the rate of fake jets. In Fig. 23 (right) the fake jet

rate as a function of jet pT is presented. It has been obtained using a sample of b¯b dijets and deﬁned as
the average number of reconstructed fake jets per event, which is well below 1%.

6.4

Jet momentum correction

The jet 4-momentum is deﬁned by the sum of 4-momenta of particles that belong to the jet. The jet axis
is identiﬁed by the jet momentum direction. We deﬁne the ﬁducial region of the jet reconstruction by
selecting jets with pseudorapidity |η| < 2.5, where η = −log[tan(θ/2)], with θ angle between the jet
axis and beam axis.

In order to recover the energy lost by reconstruction inefﬁciencies, as well as to take into account
BIB contamination, a correction to the jet 4-momentum is applied. This correction has been determined
by comparing the reconstructed jet pT with the corresponding truth-level jet pT . Truth-level jets are
deﬁned as jet clustered by applying the kt algorithm to Monte Carlo particles. Reconstructed and truth-
level jets are matched if their ∆R distance is below 0.5, i.e.:

∆R =

(cid:113)

(∆η)2 + (∆φ)2 < 0.5,

where ∆η and ∆φ are respectively the pseudo-rapidity the azimuthal angle differences between the
reconstructed-level jet axis and truth-level jet axis. If more than one reconstructed jet is matched to the
same truth-level jet than the one with lower ∆R is chosen.

The correction is evaluated in ﬁve equal-width intervals of reconstructed |η| between 0 and 2.5.
Each pseudo-rapidity interval is further divided in 19 equal-width intervals of reconstructed pT between
10 and 200 GeV. For each interval the average and standard deviation of the truth-level jet pT distribution
is calculated. Transfer functions as then obtained in each η interval by ﬁtting the average truth-level jet
pT as a function of reconstructed jet pT . Examples of transfer functions are shown in Fig. 24. These
functions are then used obtain the scale factor that is applied to each component of the reconstructed
4-momentum.

Jet reconstruction performance

6.5
The b-jet reconstruction performance is ﬁrst evaluated on the simulated sample of b¯b dijets. In Fig. 25
(left) the b-jet efﬁciency as a function of the true b-jet η is shown. It is worth noting that this is only the jet
reconstruction efﬁciency, while the ﬂavor tagging performance is studied in Section 6.8. The efﬁciency
is around 90% in the central region, but there is a drop for |η| > 2, where the efﬁciency is 20%. It has
been veriﬁed that this drop is mainly due to the fake jet removal requirement, since many jets without
reconstructed tracks are found in the forward region. In Fig. 25 (right) the b-jet efﬁciency as a function

of the true b-jet pT in the region |η| < 1.5 is presented, and it goes from 82% at low pT to 95% at higher
pT .

The relative difference between reconstructed and true b-jet η is shown in Fig. 26 (right): the
standard deviation of this distribution, directly related to the jet-axis angular resolution, is 14%. The
b-jet pT resolution as a function of the true b-jet pT is shown in Fig. 26 (right). The resolution goes from
35% for jet pT around 20 GeV to 20% for high jet pT .

The jet reconstruction performances obtained separately in the b¯b, c¯c and q ¯q samples and in the
central region (|η| < 1.5) are compared in Fig. 27. It can be seen that both the efﬁciencies and pT
resolutions are of the same order, however some differences exist between the jet ﬂavours: it has been
checked that these are mainly due to different jet η distributions in the three samples.

Invariant mass reconstruction of Higgs and Z bosons to b-quarks

6.6
The jet reconstruction is applied to the simulated samples of H → b¯b and Z → b¯b to probe the dijet in-
variant mass reconstruction. The invariant mass separation between these two processes is of paramount
importance for physics measurements at the muon collider. In this study both jets are required to have
pT > 40 GeV and |η| < 2.5. In Fig. 28 the dijet invariant mass distributions for H → b¯b and Z → b¯b
are shown. The distributions are ﬁtted with double gaussian functions, and the shapes are compared. A
relative width, deﬁned as the standard deviation divided by the average value of the mass distribution, of
27%(29%) for H → b¯b(Z → b¯b) is found. It can be seen that a signiﬁcant separation is achieved.

6.7 Future prospects on jet reconstruction

Before discussing the heavy-ﬂavour jet identiﬁcation, we notice that, at this stage, the jet reconstruction
algorithm can be improved in several ways. In this Section some guidelines are given:

– track ﬁlter: it has been veriﬁed that the track ﬁlter has a different impact in the central and the
forward region, in particular the efﬁciency in the forward region is lower. An optimized selection
should be deﬁned,

– calorimeters threshold: the hit energy threshold has been set to the relatively high value of 2
MeV, as a compromise between computing time and jet reconstruction performance. This is a
major limitation in the jet performance as can be seen in Fig. 29 (left), where the H → b¯b dijet
invariant mass, reconstructed without the presence of the BIB, is compared between 2 MeV and
200 KeV thresholds. However reducing this threshold is not an easy task, given the large number
of calorimeter hits selected from the BIB that contaminate the jet reconstruction. This is shown
in Fig. 29 (right), where can be clearly seen that the performance at 1 MeV threshold is degraded
with respect to 2 MeV. To tackle this problem an optimized algorithm should be developed: as
an example thresholds that depend on the sensor depth could by applied, since the longitudinal
energy distribution released by the BIB is different from the signal jets as shown in Fig. 30 (right).
A generalization of this idea could be the application of a multivariate-algorithm trained to select
signal hits and reject BIB hits,

– fake jet removal:

thresholds. A fake removal tool based on machine learning and with jet sub-structure observables
as input should be developed to solve this task.

vertices inside the jet cones, that are compatible with the decay of the heavy-ﬂavour hadron.

For the secondary vertices reconstruction, tracks are reconstructed with the Conformal Tracking
algorithm described in Section 5.1, where the region of interests are deﬁned by cones with ∆R = 0.7
around the jet axes. In order to reduce the computational time, the Double Layer ﬁlter (see Section 5.2)
is applied to reduce the number of hits due to BIB. The effect of this ﬁlter on the secondary vertex
reconstruction is then corrected to obtain the efﬁciency prior to its application, as will be explained in
Section 6.8.2.

6.8.1 Secondary vertex tagging

The vertexing algorithm employed for the primary and secondary vertex reconstruction is described in
detail in [80]. In order to reduce the amount of combinatorial tracks due to BIB, cuts are applied to the
reconstructed tracks given as input to the algorithm. The main steps of the algorithm and cuts to the input
tracks are here summarized:

1. primary vertex ﬁnding: tracks with |D0| ≤ 0.1 mm and |Z0| ≤ 0.1 mm are selected and given
in input to the primary vertex ﬁtter. Furthermore, to reduce the number of combinatorial short BIB
tracks, each track is required to have at least four hits in the vertex detector;

2. tracks selection for secondary vertex ﬁnder: tracks not used to reconstruct the primary vertex
are given in input to the secondary vertex ﬁtter. Fig. 31 shows the distributions of the total number
of hits in the vertex detector for combinatorial BIB tracks and for tracks matched at Monte Carlo
level with particles generated by b or c hadrons decays. A minimum number of 4 hits in the vertex
detector is required in order to keep most of the the tracks from b and c hadrons decay, while
rejecting most of BIB tracks. Other cuts on the track pT , the maximum track Z0 (longitudinal
impact parameter) and D0 (transverse impact parameter), and the D0 and Z0 errors are applied
in order to further reduce the amount of BIB tracks. As an example, Fig. 32 (left) shows the pT
distributions of BIB combinatorial tracks and tracks from b- or c-hadrons decays. By requiring
pT > 0.8 GeV about 80 % of the BIB tracks are rejected, while about 85-90 % of the tracks
from b- or c-hadrons are kept. The Z0 distributions of tracks coming from b- and c-hadrons and
combinatorial BIB tracks are shown in Fig. 32 (right). The selection of tracks with |Z0| ≤ 5 mm is
applied to reject the tails at large Z0 that characterize BIB tracks;

3. secondary vertex ﬁnding:

tracks passing the requirements are used to build two-tracks vertex
candidates, that must satisfy the following requirements: the invariant mass must be below 10 GeV
and must be smaller than the energy of each track, the position with respect to the primary vertex

6.8.2 SV-tagging performance

In order to evaluate the b-tagging efﬁciency and mis-identiﬁcation, a truth-level ﬂavour is associated to
the reconstructed jets with the following steps:

– ﬁrst, the truth-level jets are matched with the quarks from Monte Carlo to determine its ﬂavour,
requiring a distance ∆R < 0.5 between the truth-level jet axis and quark momentum. If more than
one truth-level jet is found to match with the same quark, the one with the lowest ∆R is chosen;
– then, the ﬂavour of the reconstructed jets is determined by matching them with the truth-level jets,

by requiring a ∆R distance between the jets axes below 0.5;

– if the reconstructed jet do not match with any truth-level jet, it is labeled as fake.

The characteristics of secondary vertices inside reconstructed jets have been studied in order to
reduce the mis-identiﬁcation of c, light and fake jets. Fig. 33 shows the distribution of the secondary
vertices proper lifetime (τ ) for b jets, c jets and light+fake jets. A cut on τ > 0.2 ns rejects ∼ 30% of
both c and light+fake jets, while keeping 90% of b jets. A reconstructed jet is identiﬁed (tagged) as b jet,
if at least one secondary vertex with τ > 0.2 ns is found inside its cone (∆R < 0.5).

The effect of the Double Layer Filter on the secondary vertex ﬁnding efﬁciency have been eval-
uated reconstructing b¯b, c¯c and q ¯q dijet samples without BIB, with and without the Double Layer ﬁlter.
The following ratio has been calculated as a function of of the jet pT and of the angle of the jet axis with
respect to the beam (θ):

where NnoBIB,N oDL is the number of tagged jets without double layer ﬁlter and NnoBIB,DL is the
number of tagged jets with the double layer ﬁlter. The ﬁnal tagging efﬁciencies are then corrected for
this ratio, assuming that its value does not change in the presence of the BIB. The b-tagging efﬁciency as
a function of the jet pT and θ is shown in Fig. 34. The efﬁciency is around 50% at low pT and increases
up to 70 − 80% at high pT . At low θ the efﬁciency is lower (∼ 30%) probably due to the presence
of the nozzles. The mistag for c jets is shown in Fig. 35 and is found to be around 20%. As for b-jet
efﬁciency, the c mistag increases in the central region of the detector. Fig. 36 (left) shows the mistag for
the light and fake jets versus jet pT , up to 90 GeV, and is found to be lower than 1% below 50 GeV, while
increases to 5% at higher jet pT . Fig. 36 right shows the light+fake jet mistag as a function of θ.

As for jet reconstruction, the b-jet identiﬁcation algorithm needs further improvements, but a solid
starting point has been set. In particular it will take advantage of the advancements in the vertex detector
and track reconstruction. Given the impact of the BIB, the features shown in this section are not sufﬁcient
to setup an effective c-tagging algorithm, therefore this case should be studied by deﬁning a dedicated
strategy for the muon collider environment.

7 Photons and Electrons

7.1 Photon reconstruction and identiﬁcation

The photon reconstruction and identiﬁcation performance of the muon collider detector is assessed in a
sample of 100000 events with a single photon per event. Photons were generated in the nominal collision
vertex at the center of the detector, uniformly distributed in energy between 1 and 1500 GeV, in polar
angle between 10◦ and 170◦, and in the full azimuthal angle range. The sample was then processed
with the detector simulation and fully reconstructed. 40000 events were also reconstructed with the
beam-induced background overlaid.

The reconstruction procedure includes the CKF tracking and the calorimeter reconstruction. Prior
to track reconstruction, the tracker hits were processed with the Doublet-Layer ﬁlter (see Section 5.2).
Moreover, to get rid of most of the fake tracks due to the spurious hits from the background, a track
quality selection is applied before the track reﬁtting step, which requires at least three hits in the vertex
detector and at least two hits in the inner tracker. To reject part of the background hits in the calorimeters,
an energy threshold of 2 MeV is applied to both the ECAL and HCAL hits. Photons are reconstructed
and identiﬁed with the Pandora Particle Flow algorithm. A detailed description of the package can be
found in Ref. [79].

The energy threshold of the calorimeter hits and the presence of the beam-induced background
affect the energy scale of the reconstructed photons. A correcting factor is applied to the reconstructed
photon energy to make the detector response uniform as a function of the photon energy and the photon
polar angle. The correction was calculated from a comparison of the reconstructed photon energy with
the photon energy at generation level in an independent subsample of events.

Fig. 37 shows a comparison of the photon reconstruction efﬁciency as a function of the generated
photon energy and polar angle θ with and without the BIB. The efﬁciencies are deﬁned as the fraction of
generated photons in the range 10◦ and 170◦ that are matched to a reconstructed photon within a cone

7.2 Electron reconstruction and identiﬁcation

Performance for electron reconstruction and identiﬁcation is obtained in a sample of 50000 events with a
single electron per event produced at the nominal collision point. The generated electrons are uniformly
distributed in energy between 1 and 1500 GeV, in polar angle between 10circ and 170circ, and in
azimuthal angle over the whole range. The sample was processed with the detector GEANT4 simulation
and the Marlin reconstruction algorithms. A subsample of 20000 events was also reconstructed with the
beam-induced background overlaid.

Electrons are identiﬁed by means of an angular matching of the electromagnetic clusters, recon-
structed in the same way as Section 7.1, with tracks reconstructed with the CKF algorithm, as described
in Section 5.3 in a R = 0.1 cone. The Double-Layer ﬁlter was used to clean the tracker hits upstream
the track reconstruction and tracks are required to have χ2/ndof < 10. In the presence of the beam-
induced background, the energy thresholds of the calorimeter hits play a dominant role for an efﬁcient
and precise cluster reconstruction. In this study, a threshold of 5 MeV was set. Futher developments and
more sophisticated algorithms are needed to improve the cluster reconstruction, particularly in the lower
energy regime.

The electron reconstruction and identiﬁcation efﬁciencies as a function of the electron generated

energy and polar angle are shown in Fig. 40.

8 Muons

Preliminarily, the muon reconstruction has been performed, following CLIC procedure, within the Pan-
dora PFA framework [81], that allows to investigate cluster topologies. A cluster is deﬁned as a combi-
nation of hits (one hit per layer) inside a cone and on neighbouring layers. A detailed description of the
muon reconstruction algorithm is reported in [64].

The efﬁciency, deﬁned as the ratio between generated particles associated with a cluster and to-
tal generated particles, has been evaluated for single muons with transverse momentum uniformly dis-
tributed in the range 100 MeV-1 TeV and polar angle 8° < θ < 172°. No BIB was overlaid. The cluster
efﬁciency is higher than 99% for pT > 10 GeV and higher than 98% for 8° < θ < 172°.

Muon track pT resolution is shown in Fig. 41 where ∆pT is the difference between the generated
muon pT and the pT of the corresponding Pandora PFA reconstructed track. It results to be less than
10−4 GeV−1 for pT > 30 GeV and around a factor of 7 better in the barrel region compare to the
endcap [82].

Running the Conformal Tracking algorithm on a full event and Pandora requires an enormous
computational effort to reconstruct a single event when BIB is overlaid. Moreover, Pandora reconstruc-
tion is fully driven by the tracker where the BIB hit density is very high as already discussed before. At
the same time, the BIB occupancy in the muon system is very low compared to other detectors. BIB
hits are concentrated in the endcaps around the beam axis (Fig.42 left) and a simple geometrical cut,
combined for example with a cut on the track transverse momentum, allows to get rid of almost all the
BIB hits (Fig.42 right). This suggests using standalone muon objects to seed the global muon track
reconstruction.

(cid:113)

A processor has been developed to clusterize muon hits inside a cone with a certain angular aper-
(∆φ)2 + (∆η)2. At least hits on ﬁve layers are required to make a stand-alone muon
ture ∆Rµ =
track. Reconstructed hits in the Vertex Detector, Inner Tracker and Outer Tracker are then ﬁltered using
the region-of-interest approach described in Section 5.1: only hits in a cone of aperture ∆Rt (see below)
around the muon stand-alone direction are selected. These hits are then passed to the CT algorithm. At
the moment no information coming from the ECAL and HCAL calorimeters is used.

Two different samples have been used to evaluate the performance of the processor:

1. single muons with transverse momentum uniformly distributed in the range 100 MeV-700 GeV and

to a limit of the CT algorithm, while the two dips around θ ∼ 52◦ and θ ∼ 132◦ are due to tracks with
hits both in endcap and barrel that require a speciﬁc approach, currently under study.

To study the efﬁciency as a function of transverse momentum the acceptance region was restricted
to 15◦ < θ < 165◦ to take into account only the region with a high efﬁciency for CT. Figure 44 shows an
efﬁciency greater than 85% for transverse momentum higher than 80 GeV for both the samples. The drop
of the curve at low pT is due to known effects currently under study, that mostly concern the inefﬁciency
of reconstruction of muons in the region between barrel and endcap and tracks with a high curvature for
which the choice of ∆Rt has to be optimized. The muon track transverse momentum resolution (Fig.
45) is comparable with that obtained with CT and Pandora without BIB.

In general the presence of the BIB does not strongly affect the performance: the efﬁciency is lower
only in the endcaps where all the BIB hits are concentrated, and the pT resolution is just a few percent
worse.

9 Luminosity measurement

A precise determination of the luminosity is of crucial importance for any physics absolute cross section
measurement since it directly translates to its error. LHC experiments have dedicated detectors, so-called
luminometers, installed often the backward/forward region of the detector that are used in combination to
the van Der Meer scan method to precisely measure the instantaneous luminosity. The e+e− experiments
like Belle2 [83] and BESIII [84], measure the integrated luminosity by counting the number of events
of a process whose cross section is theoretically known with high precision. The most used one is the
Bhabha scattering (e+e− → e+e−) where, for example, the theoretical uncertainty on σ at
s = 1 − 10
GeV is 0.1% at large angle [85]. Due to the reduced acceptance in the backward/forward region because
of the nozzles shielding structure at muon collider, the large angle muon Bhabha (µ+ µ− → µ+ µ−)
is proposed as a method for the luminosity measurement instead. A ﬁrst evaluation of the expected
precision has been performed by using a sample of µ-Bhabha generated with Pythia at the center-of-
mass energy of 1.5 TeV. The events are then simulated through the detector and reconstructed by using
the Pandora Particle Flow algorithm [79].

√

Muons with emission angle θ respect to the beam-pipe 30◦ < θ < 150◦ are selected. The beam-
induced background effects in this angular region are negligible, as shown in Section 8. Two opposite
sign charge muons, both with transverse momentum pT > 130 GeV and angle between muons direction
pair ∆θ > 3.08 rad are required. Finally, the di-muon invariant mass has to be 1440 < Mµµ < 1560
GeV. These selection requirements reject almost all the physics background contributions and allow to
s = 1.5 TeV. A different center of mass energy, muon reconstruction
keep the entire signal sample at
and sample selection need to be re-optimized.

√

By assuming an instantaneous luminosity L = 1.25×1034 cm−2s−1 and considering a year of data
taking (107 s) the statistical uncertainty obtained at
s = 1.5 TeV is 0.2% [86]. This study demonstrates
that the method can be applied at the muon collider from the experimental point of view. The expected
total uncertainty on the luminosity measurement using this method strongly depends on the accuracy on
the theoretical cross section of µ-Bhabha scattering at large angles, and at high center of mass energy(
several TeV). Further theoretical developments are needed in this area.
