Deep learning has recently been widely applied to many applications across different domains, e.g., image
classification and audio recognition. However, the quality of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) still raises
concerns in the practical operational environment, which calls for systematic testing, especially in safety-
critical scenarios. Inspired by software testing, a number of structural coverage criteria are designed and
proposed to measure the test adequacy of DNNs. However, due to the blackbox nature of DNN, the existing
structural coverage criteria are difficult to interpret, making it hard to understand the underlying principles of
these criteria. The relationship between the structural coverage and the decision logic of DNNs is unknown.
Moreover, recent studies have further revealed the non-existence of correlation between the structural coverage
and DNN defect detection, which further posts concerns on what a suitable DNN testing criterion should be.
In this paper, we propose the interpretable coverage criteria through constructing the decision structure of
a DNN. Mirroring the control flow graph of the traditional program, we first extract a decision graph from a
DNN based on its interpretation, where a path of the decision graph represents a decision logic of the DNN.
Based on the control flow and data flow of the decision graph, we propose two variants of path coverage to
measure the adequacy of the test cases in exercising the decision logic. The higher the path coverage, the more
diverse decision logic the DNN is expected to be explored. Our large-scale evaluation results demonstrate
that: the path in the decision graph is effective in characterizing the decision of the DNN, and the proposed
coverage criteria are also sensitive with errors including natural errors and adversarial examples, and strongly
correlated with the output impartiality.

1 INTRODUCTION
Deep Learning (DL) has achieved tremendous success and demonstrated its great potential in solving
complex tasks in many cutting-edge real-world applications such as image classification [12], speech
recognition [44], natural language processing [9] and software engineering tasks (e.g., commit
message generation [22], vulnerability detection [19] and clone detection [21]). We have also seen
an increasing demand to apply DL in some safety-critical areas, such as autonomous driving [7],
healthcare [4] and security applications [29]. However, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been
demonstrated with quality issues, e.g., to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks in spite of having

achieved high accuracy [5]. We have already witnessed real-world cases caused by quality issues
of DNNs, e.g., Tesla/Uber accidents [47] and incorrect diagnosis in healthcare [4]. The systematic
assessment of the quality of DNNs is urgently needed, especially in safety- and security-critical
scenarios.

Even until recently, the common way of quality evaluation of DNNs still mostly relies on train-
validation-test splits to calculate the accuracy, which may over-estimate the performance of the
model [41]. This motivates the software engineering community to propose a variety of novel
approaches and tools for systematically testing the quality of the DL software (i.e., the DNN).
However, due to the fundamental difference between the traditional code-based software and the
DL software (see Fig. 1(a)), the software testing techniques (e.g., code coverage) could not be directly
applied in DL software, making testing of the DL software be a new challenge.

To this end, inspired by the white-box testing of the traditional software, a number of approaches
towards testing of DL systems have been recently proposed [28]. Specifically, some structural cov-
erage criteria are proposed to measure the test adequacy of the test suite via analyzing the internal
neuron activities, e.g., Neuron Coverage (NC) [39], its variants (e.g., KMNC, NBC, SNAC) [31],
the combinatorial testing based criteria [30, 42], the Surprise Adequacy [23] and etc. Based on
the coverage criteria, automated testing techniques (e.g., DeepXplore [39], DeepTest [46] and
DeepHunter [51]) are further developed to generate test cases for maximizing the coverage.

DNN testing aims to cover diverse internal decision logics of DNN such that more bugs (i.e.,
incorrect decisions) could be detected [42, 54]. Due to the black-box nature and complexity of DNNs,
it is unknown and hard to understand the underlying principles of existing coverage criteria [28].
Specifically, for traditional software, the defects reside on particular instances of the program’s
control and data flow [33]. Thus, the code-based coverage criteria (e.g., statement coverage, branch
coverage) are meaningful and essential as covering more statements or branches is more likely
to capture diverse behavior (i.e., program logic) in terms of the control and data flow. However,
unlike the traditional software, the decision logic of DNN is opaque to human, making it hard to
understand the relationship between the decision logic and existing coverage criteria. For example,
it is not clear whether (de-)activating more neurons (i.e., NC) is better to capture more diverse
behaviors of the DNN. Thus, one may wonder what is the semantics and meaning behind existing
coverage criteria.

Some recent research [10, 20, 28, 52] started to perform a more in-depth investigation of existing
coverage criteria and have demonstrated their limitations in different perspectives. Harel-Canada
et al. have shown that NC is neither positively nor strongly correlated with defect detection,
naturalness and output impartiality [20]. For example, their experimental results have shown that
only a few inputs could already achieve 100% NC [42]. Li et al. demonstrated that the existing
testing criteria are not effective or sensitive in distinguishing same-size test sets of natural examples

including different levels of misclassification rates [28]. Dong et al. further showed that there is a
limited correlation between the coverage criteria and the robustness of the DNN [10]. These results
force us to rethink what could be a better coverage criterion of DNN and how could we design
more interpretable coverage criteria.

Motivated by the aforementioned challenges and limitations, in this paper, we propose coverage
criteria from the new angle, called Neuron Path Coverage (NPC). We argue that a better coverage
criterion should be more relevant to the decision logic of the DNN. To this end, NPC is designed to
be interpretable1 (i.e., easily understandable) and can better characterize the decision structure of
the DNN. In traditional software, a path in the control flow graph could represent the program logic
of the software (e.g., login, logout, invalid user input checking and etc.). Inspired by this, we extract
Critical Decision Paths (CDPs) from the DNN, which represent the internal decision of the DNN
on given inputs. For example, in Fig. 1(b), the DNN makes the decision along the corresponding
CDPs (e.g., the yellow path or the red path), which is to classify the input as a dog or a cat. Based
on the interpretation technique [3], we extract critical neurons in each layer, which dominate the
decision of the DNN on the target input. The critical neurons between the layers form the CDP.
Compared with the existing neuron-based coverage metric (e.g., NC [39], 𝑘-multisection Neuron
Coverage [31], IDC [15]), CDP considers not only the critical neurons in one layer but also the
relationships among layers. Moreover, the CDP is clearly related to decision-making.

We then recover the learned decision logic of the DNN by extracting CDPs from all training
samples. Intuitively, the CDP can be regarded as the control flow of the DNN that shows the
important decision logic. Hence, the objective of DL testing is to generate diverse test inputs that
can trigger different decision logic (i.e., trigger different control/data flow of the DNN). We firstly
construct a Decision Graph (DG) to represent the overall decision logics based on the training
data. Since the number of training samples may be very large, we propose the path abstraction
technique to build the abstract CDP. The abstract state represents the common decision logic that
is shared by some inputs. Based on the DG, we define two variants of path-based coverage criteria,
named Structure-based Neuron Path Coverage (SNPC) and Activation-based Neuron Path Coverage
(ANPC). Specifically, SNPC is designed based on the control-flow of the DNN (i.e., neurons in the
path) while ANPC is designed based on the data-flow of the DNN (i.e., neuron activation values in
the path). An input can increase the coverage if it can trigger a different CDP or the similar CDP
but with different activation values.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique, we evaluate NPC on 4 widely-used datasets.
Specifically, we first evaluate the accuracy of the extracted paths, i.e., whether they are critical and
useful in explaining the decision of the DNN. Our results show that the CDPs are critical for the
prediction of inputs. After masking the outputs along the CDPs, the prediction results are changed
greatly (e.g., 98.9% inconsistency rate on average). Moreover, the CDP is accurate to distinguish
decision behaviors between different inputs in the same class. Then, we evaluate the usefulness
of the proposed coverage criteria and the results show that NPC could distinguish the same-size
test sets including a different number of natural errors. In addition, NPC is positively correlated
with the output impartiality [20], i.e., test set with high output bias has lower coverage. We also
evaluate the efficiency of the coverage calculation, and the results show that the time overhead is
not very expensive although NPC adopts the interpretation analysis.
In summary, this paper makes the following main contributions:

• We propose a method to construct a decision structure of the DNN based on the CDP

extraction and abstraction.

1We say that NPC is interpretable as it is designed to identify the key neurons that contribute more on the decision of the
model based on the interpretation technique, i.e., Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) [3]

• Based on the decision structure, we propose two variants of coverage criteria that are more

relevant to the decision-making logic of the DNN.

• We conduct the comprehensive evaluation and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. Our results show that the CDP is closely relevant to the decision-making; The
proposed coverage criteria (i.e., SNPC and ANPC) are positively correlated with the detection
of natural errors and output impartiality, respectively.

2 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
In this section, we briefly introduce software testing, the challenges of DL testing, and the interpre-
tation technique LRP.

2.1 Traditional Software Testing
Software testing has been widely studied in the past decades to evaluate the quality of the software.
A central question of software testing is “what is a test criterion?”, which defines what constitutes an
adequate test [56]. In traditional software, the program logic is usually described by the programmer
and can be represented as the control flow graph (see Fig. 1(a)). Based on the clear and easy-to-
understand logic representation in the program, different coverage criteria have been proposed
to measure the test adequacy, e.g., statement coverage, branch coverage, and path coverage. These
criteria are related to the program logic and the underlying principles are also intuitive: more
program logic or behaviors could be explored by increasing the coverage (e.g., executing new
statements or paths of the program).

2.2 Challenges and Motivation
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) consist of multiple layers of neurons, which perform the nonlinear
calculation for feature extraction and transformation. Similar to traditional software testing, the
goal of DL testing is to test the decision logic of the DNN such that the incorrect prediction could
be detected [42]. However, unlike the control flow graph of the program, the logic of the DNN is
opaque to humans, making it hard to design suitable coverage criteria. Neuron outputs of the DNN
could reveal the behavior of the DNN, thus some neuron outputs based coverage criteria [23, 31, 39]
are proposed. However, it is not immediately clear how the neuron outputs reflect the internal
decision logic, making it hard to understand its underlying principles and the meaningfulness of
existing coverage criteria [28].

The value range of neuron outputs is huge and it is often impractical to enumerate all possibilities.
For efficiency, existing coverage criteria adopt different strategies to reduce the testing space. For
example, NC [39] only considers two states (i.e., activated/inactivated) for the output of each neuron.
𝑘-multisection neuron coverage [31] discretizes the output value to 𝑘 buckets. Surprise metrics [23]
select one of the layers to calculate the surprise score. The limitation is that it is unclear about
the relationship between the coverage criteria and the decision logic of the DNN (e.g., whether a
new decision-making behavior could be triggered by activating one neuron in NC). Consequently,
if the coverage criteria are too coarse, some decision logic can be missed. For example, since
NC is too coarse, several inputs can achieve very high neuron coverage [20, 42]. If the coverage
criteria are too fine-grained, a huge number of inputs are needed. It is because many of them
would trigger very similar decision logic with little difference. The further results [10, 20, 28, 42]
have also demonstrated the limitation of the existing coverage criteria, which call for new testing
criteria design. Overall, this work is motivated by the recent findings [20, 28, 42] on the limitation
of the existing coverage criteria: ① the existing coverage criteria lack the interpretability and are
unaware of the decision logic [28, 42], ② the existing coverage criteria are not sensitive to the defect

detection including both of adversarial examples and natural errors [20, 28] and ③ the existing
coverage is not positively correlated with the output diversity [20].

Motivation: Similar to the traditional software testing, a better coverage criterion for DL
testing should be interpretable and more closely related to the decision logic of the DNN,
which is what the existing coverage criteria lack. When new inputs increase the coverage, it is
expected that new decision logic would be exercised and covered.

2.3 Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)

Definition 1. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) 𝑓 consists of multiple layers ⟨𝑙1, . . . , 𝑙𝑛⟩, where 𝑙1 is
the input layer, 𝑙𝑛 is the output layer, and 𝑙2, . . . , 𝑙𝑛−1 are hidden layers. The inputs of each layer are
from outputs of the previous layer.

In this work, we mainly focus on the classifier 𝑓 : 𝑋 → 𝑌 , where 𝑋 is a set of inputs and 𝑌
is a set of classes. Given an input 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 , 𝑓 (𝑥) = arg max𝑦 𝑂𝑛, where 𝑂𝑛 is a |𝑌 |-dimensional
vector, which is the output of the output layer 𝑙𝑛. The input is classified as the class 𝑦, and we use
𝑔𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑂𝑛 (𝑦) to represent the output value (e.g., the logits) for the class 𝑦. Due to the complex
non-linear calculation in the DNN, it is usually hard to understand the decision.

Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) [3] is an effective way to interpret the decision by
calculating the key features in the input. Given a 𝑑-dimensional input 𝑥 and the classifier 𝑓 , 𝑥 is
classified as the class 𝑦. To interpret the decision, LRP calculates the relevance (or contribution) of
each dimension (i.e., pixel) in the input. Specifically, the classifier 𝑓 outputs 𝑔𝑓 (𝑥) on the class 𝑦
and LRP calculates the relevance of each input dimension:

𝑔𝑓 (𝑥) =

𝑑
∑︁

𝑅𝑙1
𝑖

𝑖=1
where 𝑅𝑙1
𝑖 represents the relevance of the dimension 𝑖 in the input layer 𝑙1 (e.g., the pixel in an
image). The sum of the relevance scores is equal to the output value 𝑔𝑓 (𝑥), which means that
each dimension can contribute to the final decision of predicting 𝑦 (i.e., 𝑔𝑓 (𝑥)). Intuitively, 𝑅𝑙1
𝑖 < 0
contributes evidence against the presence of the class which is to be classified while 𝑅𝑙1
𝑖 > 0
contributes evidence for its presence [3].

The relevance is calculated by a layer-by-layer backward propagation (from the output layer 𝑙𝑛

to the input layer 𝑙1) such that:

Fig. 2 shows the LRP calculation process on an image. In the left box, we show the “black-box”
prediction where the image is classified as a dog and outputs 𝑔𝑓 (𝑥). To interpret why it is classified
as the dog, LRP calculates the relevance layer-by-layer starting from the output 𝑔𝑓 (𝑥) (shown in
the right box). Finally, neurons/pixels that have more impact on the prediction are identified. Note
that different colors represent the different relevance scores of the corresponding neurons. Here we
use the red colored squares to represent the neurons that are more critical for extracting features
of dogs.

3 METHODOLOGY
3.1 Overview
To design coverage criteria that are related to the decision logic of DNN, it is necessary to un-
derstand the decision-making of the black-box DNN (we say DNN is black-box since it is usually
uninterpretable). Fortunately, some recent progress has been made on the interpretation of machine
learning models [3, 14, 49], which can be used for the interpretable coverage criterion.

In this work, we applied the Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) [3] to reveal the internal
decision of an input. LRP is an effective approach that interprets the classification decisions by the
decomposition of nonlinear classifiers (e.g., DNNs) such that the key features in the input (e.g.,
pixels in the images) could be identified. In particular, given an input, LRP calculates the relevance
of neurons in each layer starting from the last layer to the input layer in terms of the prediction
result. The relevance represents the effect of neurons in the decision. Based on the relevance, we
define the Critical Decision Path (CDP) that is a set of critical neurons (i.e., with larger relevance
in each layer) for the decision. Consider the left figure in Fig. 1(b) as an example, the yellow path
and the red path represent different decision logic for the prediction of dogs and cats, respectively.

Our evaluation results show that similar inputs (e.g., dogs) tend to share a similar CDP (i.e., their
decision logic is similar) while different inputs (e.g., dogs and cats) have different CDPs.

Inspired by the path coverage criterion in software testing, we propose the Neuron Path Coverage
(NPC). For example, in the control flow graph of Fig. 1(a), it returns the maximum value of the
inputs 𝑥 and 𝑦. The two paths show the clear logic of the program: the left path represents that 𝑥 is
the larger one while the right path represents that 𝑦 is the larger one. Similarly, the extracted CDPs
are used to show the logic of the DNN. For ease of understanding, we show a dummy graph in the
right figure of Fig. 1(b), if the input executes the yellow path, it is classified as the cat, otherwise, a
dog.

Fig. 3 shows a detailed workflow of our work. The decision logic of the DNN is determined by
the training data, given the target DNN, we first individually extract the CDP for each training data
(Section 3.2). The extracted CDPs represent the decision logic that is learned from the training data.
Given an input, we measure the coverage by calculating the distance between the CDP of a given
input and CDPs of training data (i.e., the difference of the decision logic). However, calculating
the distance with all training samples is computationally expensive. To improve the efficiency, we
perform the intra-class path clustering and abstraction on the CDPs of training samples (Section 3.3).
Specifically, the assumption is that the samples with similar decision logic may have similar CDP.
Thus, for the inputs predicted as the same class, we group their CDPs into 𝑘 clusters. It means
that inputs with similar decision logic are clustered into one group. For example, similar cats are
clustered together (e.g., the yellow cats and brown cats in Fig. 3). For each cluster, we further
propose the path abstraction that merges CDPs of inputs (in the cluster) into an abstract CDP.
The abstract CDP represents the decision logic for all inputs in this cluster. Finally, the number
of paths is greatly reduced. Based on the abstract CDPs, we propose the distance-based coverage
criteria (Section 3.4), which measure to what extent a new decision logic is covered by the given
test suite. Specifically, we first identify the abstract CDP of the given input and then propose two
coverage criteria. From the control flow perspective, we calculate the similarity between the new
CDP and the abstract CDP of the corresponding cluster. From the data-flow perspective, we take the
activation value of neurons in the abstract CDP into consideration and calculate the distance (along
the abstract CDP) between the input and training samples in the cluster. The similarity and distance
reveal how different the decision behavior of the new input is. Similar to [23], we divided the
similarity/distance to 𝑚 buckets and calculate how many buckets are covered by a given test suite.
To adopt the coverage criteria in testing DNNs, we need to select the optimal hyperparameters for
the CDP extraction and abstraction. We propose a method to select the parameters by evaluating
the accuracy of the CDPs on affecting the decision.

3.2 Path Extraction
In this section, we will introduce how to extract the critical decision path for a given input.

As described in Section 2.3, the relevance 𝑅𝑙

𝑖 represents the contribution to the final decision. The
larger relevance the relevance 𝑅𝑙
𝑖 , the more contribution the neuron 𝑖 at the layer 𝑙. Since the DNN
prediction is based on the features extracted and transformed layer-by-layer, we use the critical
neurons with large relevance in each layer to represent the internal decision of the DNN. Then we
define the critical decision path along all layers of the DNN as follows:

Definition 2 (Critical Decision Path). Given an input 𝑥 and the DNN 𝑓 consisting of 𝑛 layers,
we define its 𝛼-Critical Decision Path (𝛼-CDP) as a sequence of neurons sets 𝑝 = ⟨𝑠1, . . . , 𝑠𝑛−1⟩, where
𝑠𝑖 is a set of critical neurons that have the largest relevance values at the layer 𝑙𝑖 and

(∀𝑗 ∈ 𝑠𝑖 .𝑅𝑙𝑖

𝑗 > 0) ∧ (

𝑅𝑙𝑖
𝑗 > 𝛼 · 𝑔𝑓 (𝑥))

∑︁

𝑗 ∈𝑠𝑖

8

Xiaofei Xie, Tianlin Li, Jian Wang, Lei Ma, Qing Guo, Felix Juefei-Xu, and Yang Liu

where 𝛼 is a parameter that controls the number of the selected critical neurons at each layer.

The neuron is critical if it provides a positive contribution to the decision (i.e., the positive
relevance). We first sort neurons of each layer by the relevance values, and the CDP is composed
of the most critical neurons at each layer. As a layer may have multiple critical neurons, we use
the parameter 𝛼 to prioritize the more critical ones. The smaller the 𝛼, the fewer critical neurons
are selected at each layer. Other neurons that are not selected in the CDP are called Non-Critical
Decision Path (NCDP).

We define the width of the CDP as the average ratio of neurons selected at each layer. It is worth
mentioning that, for different inputs, the width of the CDP may be different even with the same
value for the parameter 𝛼. For each input, we select the CDP that has a large effect on the prediction
while the NCDP (i.e., other neurons) has little impact. Furthermore, the width of the CDP (i.e., the
selected neurons) should be as small as possible such that it can represent different decision logic
accurately. Consider an extreme case like that, we could use all neurons of the network as the CDP,
which does not lose any information. However, it cannot distinguish the decision logic between
different inputs because all inputs have the same CDP (i.e., the DNN). Our evaluation demonstrated
that CDPs with a suitable width could better reveal different predictions, i.e., inputs predicted to
be the same class share similar CDPs while inputs predicted to be different classes have different
CDPs.

3.3 Path Abstraction
The decision logic of the DNN is determined by the training data, thus we recover its main decision
logic that is learned from the training data. Given a classifier 𝑓 and its training data 𝑇 , we construct
the CDP for each sample in 𝑇 , which are used to estimate the learned logic of the DNN roughly.
However, analyzing all CDPs of 𝑇 may introduce high computational costs especially when the
size of 𝑇 is large. Moreover, some training data may share similar decision behaviors. To reduce
the computational cost, we introduce a two-stage method to calculate the abstract CDPs.

Intra-Class Path Clustering. The assumption is that, the inputs that are predicted to be the same
class, should have similar CDPs because the DNN has similar decisions on these inputs. Thus,
our basic idea is to generate representative CDPs, which could characterize the common decision
pattern on these inputs.

In particular, suppose the classifier 𝑓 performs a classification task with a set of classes 𝑌 , we
group the training samples on the predicted class 𝑦 ∈ 𝑌 , i.e., 𝑇𝑦 = {𝑥 ∈ 𝑇 |𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑦}. For each class
𝑦, although the decision logic on the inputs 𝑇𝑦 is similar, they may still have some slight difference.
For example, the decision of the yellow cats may be slightly different from the brown cats. To
capture more fine-grained decision logic in each class 𝑦, we cluster CDPs of the samples in 𝑇𝑦 into
𝑘 groups. We apply the 𝐾-Means clustering algorithm in this paper. Specifically, for each sample,
we obtain a vector that represents the status of all neurons of the DNN. If a neuron is included in
the CDP, its status is marked as 1 in the vector, otherwise, it is marked as 0. Note that all vectors
have the same size such that they can be clustered. 𝐶 𝑦
𝑗 ⊆ 𝑇𝑦 denotes the training samples in the 𝑗𝑡ℎ
cluster. The samples in the same cluster have more similar decision-making logic than samples in
other clusters.

Path Merging. For CDPs in each cluster, we then propose the path abstraction by merging
in the 𝑗𝑡ℎ cluster, we calculate an abstract CDP
𝑠𝑥
𝑖 . For each

them into an abstract path. Specifically, for 𝐶 𝑦
ˆ𝑝 = ⟨ˆ𝑠1, . . . , ˆ𝑠𝑛−1⟩ by merging neurons in each layer: ∀𝑖 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝑛 − 1} : ˆ𝑠𝑖 = (cid:208)

𝑗

𝑥 ∈𝐶 𝑦

neuron 𝑡 ∈ ˆ𝑠𝑖 , we calculate its weight as:

𝑤𝑡 =

|{𝑥 |𝑥 ∈ 𝐶 𝑦
𝑗 ∧ 𝑡 ∈ 𝑠𝑥
|𝐶 𝑦
𝑗 |

𝑖 }|

where 𝑠𝑥
𝑖

is the set of critical neurons at the layer 𝑖 in the CDP of the input 𝑥.

Intuitively, for a set of inputs, the abstract CDP is the union of their critical neurons at each layer.
The weight of each neuron 𝑤𝑡 represents the ratio of CDPs that the neuron 𝑡 belongs to. The larger
the weight, the more critical this neuron is (i.e., it is critical for more CDPs of training samples in
this cluster). After merging the paths, the abstract CDP could be much larger than the CDP of one
input. There are some neurons in the abstract CDP, which may have small weight. Statistically,
neurons with smaller weights may be less important for interpreting the decision on the set of
inputs. Thus, we further introduce the parameter 𝛽 to select the critical neurons whose weights are
above the threshold and obtain the abstract CDP ˆ𝑝𝛽 = (cid:10)ˆ𝑠1,𝛽, . . . , ˆ𝑠𝑛−1,𝛽 (cid:11), where

ˆ𝑠𝑖,𝛽 = {𝑡 |𝑡 ∈ ˆ𝑠𝑖 ∧ 𝑤𝑡 > 𝛽}

Based on the abstract CDPs, we characterize the decision logic of a DNN as a decision graph,

which is similar to the control flow of programs.

Definition 3 (Decision Graph). The Decision Graph (DG) of a classifier 𝑓 is composed of a set of
abstract CDPs 𝐺 = {( ˆ𝑝1,1

3.4 Neuron Path Coverage
The decision graph represents the main logic of the DNN learned from its training data. Given a
new input, it is expected that the input could be predicted correctly via the learned decision logic.
DL testing aims to identify failed inputs that are possibly caused by triggering either unknown logic
or incorrect logic. Specifically, unknown logic means that the CDP of the input has low similarity
with abstract CDPs in the DG, i.e., the DNN may not be able to learn the logic with the training
data. Incorrect logic means that the input exercises the incorrect CDP, e.g., one dog may have a
similar CDP with a cat. We propose the path coverage to measure the adequacy of a given test
suite. Intuitively, the more paths covered, the more logic explored.

Specifically, inspired by the traditional software testing, we consider the control flow and data
flow of the DNN and propose two variants of path-based coverage criteria: the Structure-based
Neuron Path Coverage (SNPC) and the Activation-based Neuron Path Coverage (ANPC). SNPC mainly
considers the control flow, i.e., the path structure while ANPC considers the data flow, i.e., the
neuron outputs in the path.

Theoretically, like paths in traditional programs, the number of the paths in DNN could be
infinite. To mitigate this problem, we follow the strategy [23] by calculating the distance and use
bucketing to discretize the space of the distance.

Structure-based Neuron Path Coverage. Given an input 𝑥 with the CDP 𝑝𝑥 , we first identify
3.4.1
the clusters based on the predicted result 𝑓 (𝑥). Suppose 𝐺 𝑓 (𝑥) = { ˆ𝑝 𝑓 (𝑥),1
} is the set of
abstract paths that are extracted from clusters of the class 𝑓 (𝑥). We measure the similarity between
𝑝𝑥 and each of the abstract paths in 𝐺 𝑓 (𝑥) , which represents the difference of the decision behavior
of the given input 𝑥 with the existing abstract paths. Then we divide the similarity into multiple
buckets and calculate the coverage, i.e., how many buckets are covered.

Given two paths 𝑝𝑥 and ˆ𝑝, we calculate the similarity layer by layer. For a layer 𝑙, the similarity

𝐽𝑝𝑙

𝑥 , ˆ𝑝𝑙 =

𝑠𝑥
𝑙 ∩ ˆ𝑠𝑙
𝑠𝑥
𝑙 ∪ ˆ𝑠𝑙

(1)

where 𝑠𝑥

𝑙 and ˆ𝑠𝑙 are the neurons in the 𝑙𝑡ℎ layer of 𝑝𝑥 and ˆ𝑝, respectively.

Then we divide the continuous space of the similarity (i.e., [0,1]) into 𝑚 equal buckets 𝐵 =
{𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚 }. For an input 𝑥 and a target abstract path ˆ𝑝, the covered bucket at layer 𝑙 is denoted as:

𝑏𝑙
𝑥, ˆ𝑝 = 𝑏𝑖 if 𝐽𝑝𝑙

𝑥 , ˆ𝑝𝑙 ∈ (

𝑖 − 1
𝑚

,

𝑖
𝑚

]

Given a test suite 𝑋 , we define the Structure-based Neuron Path Coverage as follows:

𝑆𝑁 𝑃𝐶 (𝑋 ) =

|{𝑏𝑙

𝑥, ˆ𝑝 |∀𝑥 ∈ 𝑋, ∀ ˆ𝑝 ∈ 𝐺 𝑓 (𝑥), ∀𝑙 ∈ 𝑓 }|
𝑛 · 𝑘 · | ˆ𝑝 | · 𝑚

(2)

where ˆ𝑝 is the corresponding abstract CDP, | ˆ𝑝 | is the total number of layers, 𝑛 is the number of the
total classes, 𝑘 is the number of clusters in the class 𝑓 (𝑥) and 𝑚 is the number of buckets.

Specifically, for each layer of the abstract path, we divide the neuron similarity [0, 1] (i.e., Jaccard
similarity) between two layers into 𝑚 buckets. Finally, there are a total of 𝑛 · 𝑘 · | ˆ𝑝 | · 𝑚 buckets,
where 𝑛 · 𝑘 is the total number of abstract CDPs and | ˆ𝑝 | is the number of layers. SNPC calculates
how many buckets can be covered by a test suite 𝑋 . For a test case 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 and a layer 𝑙, we
calculate the layer similarity between the CDP of 𝑥 and the corresponding abstract CDP ˆ𝑝. The
similarity falls into a specific bucket 𝑏𝑙
𝑥, ˆ𝑝 . We identify all buckets covered by the test suite 𝑋 , i.e.,
{𝑏𝑙

𝑥, ˆ𝑝 |∀𝑥 ∈ 𝑋, ∀ ˆ𝑝 ∈ 𝐺 𝑓 (𝑥), ∀𝑙 ∈ 𝑓 }, and calculate the coverage.
We take the similarities with all ˆ𝑝 into consideration for a more fine-grained coverage analysis.
This is because one test sample could be relevant with multiple abstract paths in the same class.
For example, one abstract path may represent dogs with white color while another abstract path
may represent dogs with long ears. Thus, comparing the similarity between the CDP of a test input
and different abstract CDPs could measure the input on different feature levels (i.e., with different
abstract CDPs).

The higher the coverage criteria, the more diverse logic the DNN has been explored. However,
SNPC only considers the control flow, which might be coarse in some cases. To be more fine-grained,
we therefore propose another variant of path coverage that adopts the concrete activation values
of neurons in the path (i.e., data flow).

3.4.2 Activation-based Neuron Path Coverage. In SNPC, we adopt the Jaccard similarity to calculate
the structural similarity between the CDP of the input 𝑥 and the abstract CDP of a cluster. To be
more fine-grained, we consider the data flow of the CDP, i.e., the activation values of neurons in
the CDP and calculate the distance between the values of two CDPs. Specifically, given an input 𝑥
and a cluster 𝑗, we first select the closest training sample 𝑥 ′ from the cluster 𝑗, which has highest
similarity with 𝑥:

𝑥 ′ = arg max
𝑥 ′ ∈𝐶 𝑓 (𝑥 )
𝑗

𝐽𝑝𝑥 ,𝑝𝑥′

where 𝐽𝑝𝑥 ,𝑝𝑥′ is the Jaccard similarity between CDPs of 𝑥 and 𝑥 ′. Then, we calculate the distance
between the activation values of 𝑥 and 𝑥 ′ along the abstract CDP in the cluster. Intuitively, the
larger the distance, the more different decision behaviors are triggered by the new input 𝑥, i.e.,
compared with the samples in cluster 𝑗, more behavior is covered by the new input. For the input

NPC: Neuron Path Coverage via Characterizing Decision Logic of Deep Neural Networks

11

𝑥, we use 𝐴(𝑥, ˆ𝑝𝑙 ) to denote the activation values of neurons in the 𝑙𝑡ℎ layer of the abstract path ˆ𝑝.
The distance at the 𝑙𝑡ℎ layer between 𝑥 and 𝑥 ′ is defined as:

𝑥,𝑥 ′ = ||𝐴(𝑥, ˆ𝑝𝑙 ) − 𝐴(𝑥 ′, ˆ𝑝𝑙 )||
𝐷𝑙
Similar to [23], we introduce an upper bound 𝑈 and divide the distance [0, 𝑈 ] into 𝑚 buckets:
𝐵 = {𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚 }. Given an input 𝑥 and an abstract path ˆ𝑝 in the corresponding cluster, we define
𝑑𝑙
𝑥, ˆ𝑝 as the covered bucket, i.e., the layer distance 𝐷𝑙

𝑥,𝑥 ′ falls into a bucket:

𝑥, ˆ𝑝 = 𝑏𝑖 if 𝐷𝑙
𝑑𝑙

𝑥,𝑥 ′ ∈ (𝑈 ·

𝑖 − 1

]

Given a test suite 𝑋 , we define the Activation-based Neuron Path Coverage (ANPC) as:

𝐴𝑁 𝑃𝐶 (𝑋 ) =

|{𝑑𝑙

𝑥, ˆ𝑝 |∀𝑥 ∈ 𝑋, ∀ ˆ𝑝 ∈ 𝐺 𝑓 (𝑥), ∀𝑙 ∈ 𝑓 }|
𝑛 · 𝑘 · | ˆ𝑝 | · 𝑚

(3)

From the definitions, we can see that the key difference between SNPC and ANPC is that SNPC

𝑥, ˆ𝑝 ) based on the neuron activation distance. With the coverage criteria, we could

3.4.3 Hyperparameter Tuning. In the two coverage criteria, we have three hyperparameters, i.e.,
𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝑘, which determine the precision of the (abstract) CDPs with regards to representing
the decision logic. To adopt the proposed coverage criteria in DL testing, the hyperparameter
tuning is required. We propose a strategy to evaluate the precision of the CDPs (under a set of
hyperparameters) on representing the decision logic as follows:

(1) For each training data, we extract its CDP and the NCDP. The expectation is that the CDP
has large impact on the decision of the data while the NCDP has less impact on the decision.
Moreover, the width of the CDP should be as small as possible such that only critical neurons
are selected. Specifically, we respectively dropout the outputs of neurons (i.e., mask the
results as zero) in the CDP and the NCDP, and evaluate whether the prediction result is
changed (i.e., inconsistent). We evaluate the inconsistency rate on all training data on some
hyperparameters and select the best ones that satisfies our assumption.

(2) Similarly, we evaluate the precision of abstract CDPs. For the abstract CDP of a cluster, we
calculate the inconsistency rate on all training data of the cluster. For each data, we dropout
the same neurons that belong to the abstract CDP. The inconsistency rate is expected to be
high by masking the neurons of the abstract CDP and low by masking the neurons of the
abstract NCDP.

In our paper, the value ranges of the three hyperparameters 𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝑘 are {0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0},
{0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9} and {1, 4, 7}, respectively.

4 EVALUATION

4.1 Setup
To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we have implemented the coverage criteria based on
the PyTorch framework. We design experiments to demonstrate the usefulness of our method in
mitigating these challenges. Specifically, we aim to investigate and answer the following research
questions:

12

Xiaofei Xie, Tianlin Li, Jian Wang, Lei Ma, Qing Guo, Felix Juefei-Xu, and Yang Liu

• RQ1: How does the CDP affect the decision of the DNN? The CDP only selects the critical
neurons in each layer. We design the experiment to evaluate whether such neurons are critical
for DNN decisions.

• RQ2: How accurate is the abstract CDP in revealing internal decisions? Since the abstract CDP
is extracted from CDPs of training samples in the corresponding cluster, we aim to evaluate
whether the abstract CDP is still accurate in representing the DNN decision on these training
samples in the cluster.

• RQ3: Is NPC sensitive with errors including natural errors and adversarial examples? We in-
vestigate whether the proposed coverage criteria are sensitive in distinguishing the decision
difference between erroneous samples and benign samples.

• RQ4: Is NPC correlated to the output impartiality? A test suite should exercise diverse behaviors
and should not prefer only a few output values [28]. We investigate whether the coverage criteria
can reveal the impartiality of the test suite, i.e., the test suite with diverse behaviors should have
high coverage while the test suite with biased behavior should have low coverage.

• RQ5: How efficient is the calculation of NPC? Since NPC extracts decision behaviors based on
the interpretation method, we investigate whether the interpretation analysis could introduce
much time overhead for the coverage calculation.

4.2 Subject Datasets and DNNs
We selected three widely used datasets in the image classification domain and trained four models
with competitive test accuracy, which are widely used in the previous works [23, 31, 39].

• MNIST [26] is for handwritten digit image recognition (i.e., handwritten digits from 0 to 9),
containing 60, 000 training data and 10, 000 test data. We select the five layer Convolutional
Neural Network [23] (named SADL-1) and achieve an accuracy of 99.1%.

• CIFAR-10 [24] is a collection of images for general-purpose image classification, including
50, 000 training data and 10, 000 test data in 10 different classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, birds, and
cats). We select two models, i.e., the 12-layer Convolutional Neural Network [23] (named SADL-2)
and VGG16, which achieved the accuracy of 90.36% and 89.17%, respectively.

• SVHN [36] dataset is house numbers in Google Street View images, including 73,257 training

data and 26,032 test data. We select the model AlexNet that has an accuracy of 94.31%.

• ImageNet is a large-scale visual recognition challenge (ILSVRC) dataset. The ImageNet contains
a large number of training data (i.e., over one million) and test data (i.e., 50,000) with 1000 classes,
each of which is of size 224×224×3. To reduce the complexity of training and CDP evaluation, we
select the first 10 classes to train a classifier with the model VGG16 that performs the classification
on the 10 categories. The model is trained with an accuracy of 76.81%.

4.3 Baselines
We select the state-of-the-art coverage criteria as the baselines for the evaluation, i.e., Neuron
Coverage (NC) [39], 𝑘-Multisection Neuron Coverage (KMNC) [31], Neuron Boundary Coverage
(NBC) [31], Likelihood-based Surprise Coverage (LSC) [31], Distance-based Surprise Coverage
(DSC) [23] and Importance-Driven Coverage (IDC) [15]. Due to that the original IDC only supports
Keras models, we implemented a PyTorch version of IDC for the comparison.

To be comprehensive, for NC, we set the threshold as 0, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.75 following [20]. For
KMNC and NBC, we follow the configuration [31, 51] and set the 𝑘 value as 1,000 and 10. For LSC
and DSC, we follow the configuration [23], set the upper bound 2,000 and 2.0 respectively, and set
the number of buckets as 1,000. For the layer selection, we select the same layer in SADL-1 and
SADL-2, which is used in [23]. For VGG16 in CIFAR and ImageNet, we select the last layer since it

achieved the best result. For IDC, we follow the same configuration [15] and select the penultimate
layer for each model. In the selected layer, we choose the top 12 important neurons. For SNPC and
ANPC, we set the number of buckets as 200 and the upper bound as 2.0.

4.4 RQ1: Relationship between CDP and the DNN Decision

4.4.1 Results of masking neurons of CDPs/NCDPs.

Mask all neurons. To evaluate whether the CDP has a critical impact on the decision of the DNN,
we dropout the outputs of neurons in the CDP (i.e., mask them as zero) and check whether the
predicted result is inconsistent with the original result. Intuitively, we say that the CDP is accurate
to reveal the decision if 1) the predicted output is largely affected after the neurons of the CDP are
masked and 2) the predicted output is less affected after neurons in NCDP are masked. We extract
CDPs for all training data and calculate the inconsistency rate after masking neurons in their CDPs
and the corresponding NCDPs, respectively. Specifically, the inconsistency rate of the classifier is
defined as:

{𝑥 |𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 ∧ 𝑓 (𝑥) ≠ 𝑓𝑚 (𝑥)}
|𝑋 |
where 𝑋 is a set of test cases, 𝑓 (𝑥) is the prediction result of the original classifier 𝑓 on the input 𝑥
and 𝑓𝑚 (𝑥) is the prediction result after masking the CDP or NCDP of 𝑥. Intuitively, the higher the
inconsistency rate, the larger the impact of the masked path.

Table 1 shows the average inconsistency rate by masking all neurons in the CDPs/NCDPs of all
training data. The inconsistency rate shows the percentage of samples, whose prediction results
are changed after the masking. To extract the path, we configure the parameter 𝛼 (see Definition 2)
with different values, i.e., 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1. Under each configuration, we show the average width
of the CDP (Column Width), which is the average ratio of neurons at each layer of the CDP, and
the inconsistency rate after masking CDP (Column Inc.C) and masking NCDP (Column Inc.NC).

The results show that the width of the CDP increases as the parameter 𝛼 increases. For example,
when 𝛼 is 0.8, the average width on VGG-16 is 13.3%, indicating that 13.3% critical neurons are
selected at each layer. When 𝛼 is 1, the width becomes much larger (i.e., 33.8%). Furthermore, we
found that almost all predicted results are changed when the CDPs are masked (e.g., for SADL-2
and VGG16, the inconsistency rate is 100% for all configuration), which demonstrates that the CDP
is very critical for the decision. Conversely, when we mask other neurons that are not in the CDP
(i.e., the NCDP), the inconsistency is very low (0% to 3%). In particular, when 𝛼 is small, the width
is small (i.e., less neurons are selected) and the performance is relatively low. For example, when
𝛼 is 0.7, the inconsistency rate of masking CDP on SADL-1 is 89.3%, which is lower than 98.9%
(𝛼 = 1); The inconsistency rate of masking NCDP in CIFAR-VGG16 is much higher (12.1%) than
other configurations regarding 𝛼, which shows that there are some critical neurons (in NCDP)
that are missed. Based on the results in Table 1, in the following experiments, we set 𝛼 as 0.8,

Imagenet-VGG16, respectively. We also evaluate the CDPs on test data and the results show the
similar trends.

Mask parts of neurons of CDPs. To further evaluate the impact of CDP, we conduct a fine-grained
evaluation that only masks a small part of neurons based on their relevance. Specifically, for a
given CDP, we sort the neurons at each layer of the CDP and then split these sorted neurons into 5
equal buckets that have different relevance values, i.e., the top 20% neurons with high relevance,
the 20%-40% neurons, the 40%-80% neurons and the last 20% neurons (i.e., 80%-100%) with low
relevance. We get 5 sub-CDPs that contain neurons with different relevance values. Then we mask
each of the sub-CDPs and calculate the inconsistency rate. Table 2 shows the inconsistency rate by
only masking parts of the CDP. Overall, we could find that the neurons with higher relevance can
have a larger impact on the prediction. After we mask the most important part (i.e., the top 20%
neurons), the largest inconsistency rate is caused, which indicates that these neurons have larger
impact. When the last 20% neurons are masked, the inconsistency rate is the smallest.

We also observe that the results depend on the tasks and models. For example, on CIFAR-VGG16,
after masking the top 20% neurons of CDPs, most inputs are inconsistent with the original prediction
(97.94%), which shows that these neurons are quite important for the prediction. However, for the
model SADL-2, only 9.13% inputs are inconsistent after masking the top 20% neurons of the CDPs.
Refer to the results in Table 1, after masking all neurons in the CDP (𝛼 = 0.7), the inconsistency
rate on SADL-2 becomes 100%. It means that all neurons of the CDPs on SADL-2 are important for
the prediction. Consider the results of CIFAR-VGG16 and ImageNet-VGG16, although the same
model architecture is used, their results are not consistent, indicating that the CDPs are different
on different datasets.

4.4.2 Results on effect of the width. The width of the CDP may affect its accuracy in representing
the decision logic. If the width is too large, the CDP contains some non-critical neurons that may
also be included in other CDP, making it hard to distinguish them. We investigate the similarity
between different classes. Specifically, for each class, we randomly select 100 test data that is

NPC: Neuron Path Coverage via Characterizing Decision Logic of Deep Neural Networks

15

correctly predicted as the target class. Then we calculate the average similarity of CDPs in the
same class or between different classes as follows:

𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎 = 𝑎𝑣𝑔({𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑥 𝑦

𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑦

𝑗 )|𝑦 ∈ 𝑌 ∧ 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗 ∧ 𝑥 𝑦
)|𝑦𝑚 ∈ 𝑌 ∧ 𝑦𝑛 ∈ 𝑌 ∧ 𝑚 ≠ 𝑛 ∧ 𝑥 𝑦𝑚

𝑖 ∈ 𝑋 𝑦 ∧ 𝑥 𝑦

𝑗 ∈ 𝑋 𝑦 })
∈ 𝑋 𝑦𝑚 ∧ 𝑥 𝑦𝑛

𝑖

𝑗 ∈ 𝑋 𝑦𝑛 })

𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 = 𝑎𝑣𝑔({𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑥 𝑦𝑚

𝑖

, 𝑥 𝑦𝑛
𝑗

where 𝑌 is the set of all classes, 𝑋 𝑦 is a set of test data (its size is 100) in the class 𝑦, 𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑥, 𝑦) =
(cid:205)𝑙 ∈𝑓 𝐽
𝑥 ,𝑝𝑙
𝑝𝑙
𝑦
represents the similarity between CDPs of 𝑥 and 𝑦 (see Equation 1). Intuitively, the
|𝑓 |
similarity between CDPs of the same class should be greater than the similarity between CDPs of
two different classes.

Table 3 shows the average similarity between two CDPs in the same class (i.e., Column Intra)
and in different classes (i.e., Column Inter) on the training data. The results show that the average
similarity increases with the increase of the width, which further demonstrates that, if the CDP is
too wide, it is not accurate to show the decision difference on two inputs. If the width of the CDP
is too small, then it may miss some critical neurons (see Table 1).

Answer to RQ1: CDPs are critical for the prediction while NCDPs are not critical, which
reveals that the CDPs are more relevant to the internal decision logic of the DNN.

4.5 RQ2: Effectiveness of Path Abstraction

Setup. Since the abstract path represents the decision logic of training samples in the correspond-
ing cluster, we first investigate whether the abstract path is still critical for the prediction of inputs
in the cluster. Similar to RQ1, we mask the abstract CDP/NCDP and see the average inconsistency
rate of training inputs in the cluster. Then, we evaluate whether the path abstraction could identify
similar decision logic by measuring the similarity with or without clustering. Specifically, for each
cluster that contains a set of training samples 𝑋 , we can calculate its abstract CDP based on all
CDPs of 𝑋 . To evaluate the precision of the path abstraction, for every input 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 , we masked the
same neurons (i.e., the abstract CDP) and evaluate the average inconsistency rate. Note that, in
RQ1, we mask different neurons for different inputs of 𝑋 based on their individual CDPs while we
mask the same neurons (in the abstract CDP) for all inputs of 𝑋 in RQ2.

Impact on prediction. For the path abstraction of each DNN, we investigate a total of 16
4.5.1
configurations with different parameters (𝑘, 𝛽), where 𝑘 is the number of the clusters in each class
and 𝛽 is the threshold to select neurons with high weights (the first column in Table 4). Note that,
when 𝑘 = 1, the abstract CDP is extracted by merging CDPs of all inputs that are predicted as the
same class.

The results in Table 4 show that, with the increase of the number of clusters, the width tends to
be slightly larger in most cases under the same threshold 𝛽 (see Column Wid.), indicating that the
average weight of neurons is also larger (i.e., CDPs in each cluster share more common neurons).
We count the number of the change of Inc.C and found that 81.25% (39/48) of the Inc.C change is
increasing or unchanged when the number of clusters increases. More fine-grained clustering (i.e.,
more clusters) could merge the similar CDPs together, by which the abstract CDP is more stable
(larger average weights) and accurate (higher inconsistency rate after masking CDPs). The results
demonstrate the usefulness of clustering and merging.

Compared with the results on single CDPs (Table 1), we found that the abstract path could still
achieve competitive performance and even better than single CDPs on some models. It means
that the path abstraction can be used to select commonly important neurons for all training data
in a specific cluster (i.e., high inconsistency rate after masking CDPs and low inconsistency rate

after masking NCDPs). For example, on SADL-2, the inconsistency rates of CDP and NCDP are
98.2% and 1.6% (𝑘 = 7), which are close to results of single CDPs (i.e., 100% and 0%) and the width
is much smaller (e.g., 5.4% for abstract CDPs and 27.2% for single CDPs). For AlexNet, using the
abstraction in the cluster, we could select more accurate CDPs (e.g., the average width of the abstract
CDPs and the single CDPs is 18.5% and 23.0%). Finally, in the following experiments, we select the
configuration (4, 0.8), (7, 0.9), (7, 0.9), (4, 0.6) and (4, 0.7) as the parameters for SADL-1, SADL-2,
VGG-16, AlexNet and VGG-16 (ImangeNet), respectively (the bold numbers). These configurations
are selected due to that we expect to select the neurons that can be representative and critical.
Firstly, we could not leave critical neurons out, thus we need to ensure a great inconsistent rate
under the selected configurations. Secondly, the width of critical neurons should not be great
because the critical neurons are expected to be representative and discriminative. If the width is
too large, there will be a large overlap between different critical neurons.

4.5.2 Decision Revealing. Table 5 shows the results on the average similarity with and without
clustering. Column #Clus. shows the number of clusters configured for each model. Without
clustering, Column #Intra_Cla. shows the average similarity between CDPs that are in the same
class (i.e., the intra-class similarity). Column #Inter_Cla. shows the average similarity between
CDPs that belong to different classes (i.e., the inter-class similarity). After the clustering, we show
the average similarity between CDPs in the same cluster (i.e., intra-cluster similarity shown in
Column #Intra_Clus.) and the average similarity between CDPs in different clusters of the same
class (i.e., inter-cluster similarity shown in Column #Inter_Clus.). Note that inter-cluster similarity
only compares clusters that belong to the same class

Comparing the results between intra-class similarity (without clustering) and intra-cluster
similarity (with clustering), we found that the average similarity increases (e.g., from 0.628 to 0.708
in SADL-1). In particular, in the same class, the inter-cluster similarity is much smaller than intra-
cluster similarity although the two clusters belong to the same class (e.g., 0.708 for intra-cluster
and 0.381 for inter-cluster). Moreover, the inter-cluster similarity is even close to the inter-class
similarity. The results show that samples in the same class could have different decision logic (e.g.,
the black dogs and white dogs may be different). By the path abstraction, we generate fine-grained
CDPs which could distinguish such differences well.

Fig. 4. Inputs sampled from clusters in the class 4 and 5

Fig. 4 shows some examples whose CDPs are clustered into different groups (on SADL-1). Each
row represents one cluster. We can observe that, from the human’s perception, the inputs in the
same cluster look very similar. For example, the digit “4” looks similar to the digit “9” in the fourth
cluster and the digit “5” has a slight deflection in the first cluster. The results further show that
inputs that trigger the similar decision logic is likely to be grouped into one cluster based on the
extracted CDPs.

Answer to RQ2: Based on the aggregation (i.e., union) of all CDPs in each cluster, the abstract
CDP is still critical for predicting inputs in a cluster. Moreover, the abstract CDP is sensitive to
reveal different decision logic. Inputs in the same cluster have similar decision and inputs in
different clusters of the same class tend to have different decision behavior.

4.6 RQ3: Sensitivity with Defect Detection

Setup. Motivated by [20, 28], this experiment evaluates the effectiveness in detecting defects
including natural errors2 and adversarial examples. We follow the similar design in [28]: first, we
randomly select 1,000 benign samples (denoted as 𝑠0) from the test data. Then, we construct several
test suites by replacing a small number of samples of 𝑠0 with the same number of errors such that
they have the same size. To be specific, for natural errors, we select a certain number of inputs
from the test data in each class, which are predicted incorrectly. For adversarial examples, we adopt
the PGD attack [34] to generate a large number of adversarial examples, some of which are then
randomly selected in each class. For natural errors and adversarial examples, we generate 6 test

2In this paper, "natural error" represents the natural input that is not manually crafted and is misclassified by the target
model.

suites including different numbers of errors (i.e., 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 7%, 10%), respectively. We use 𝑆 to
denote the set of the test suites including the initial set 𝑠0. To reduce the randomness, we repeat
the process 5 times and calculate the average results.

Results. Fig. 5 shows the results on the test suites including a different number of errors. To
conduct the comparison between different approaches, all the coverage is normalized to [-1,1].
Specifically, for each test suite 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆, we calculate its coverage change compared with the initial
test suite 𝑠0 with regard to the coverage criterion 𝐶𝑜𝑣, i.e., Δ = {𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑠) − 𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑠0)|𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 }. For each
𝑠 ∈ 𝑆, we normalize the change of the coverage as follows:

𝑁𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑠) =

𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑠) − 𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑠0)
𝑚𝑎𝑥 (Δ) − 𝑚𝑖𝑛(Δ)

(4)

Note that the coverage change can be a negative value.

The first row shows the average results on natural errors (Nat.) and the second row shows the
results on adversarial examples (AE). The horizontal axis represents the percentage of errors while
the vertical axis represents the normalized coverage.

The results show that the coverage criteria exhibit different performance on different number of
errors. In general, we could find that SNPC and ANPC tend to be more stable than other methods
in terms of the sensitivity to errors. In most cases, the trends of SNPC and ANPC are in line with
the expectations, i.e., the coverage can increase when more errors (adversarial examples or natural
errors) are introduced. NBC is the most unstable one because it mainly focuses on the boundary
behaviors of the model. For KMNC and NC (with threshold 0.5), we observe that they perform better
in natural errors than adversarial examples. The coverage of NC and KMNC increases when the
number of natural errors increase. However, their coverage does not always increase on adversarial
examples. Particularly, KMNC decreases on AEs of CIFAR-VGG16, ALexNet and ImageNet-VGG16.
We conjecture that KMNC mainly considers the major functionality of the DNN while ignoring the
boundary functionality, thus replacing some benign samples with the corner cases (e.g., adversarial
examples) could decrease the diversity of major behavior. LSC performs better in most cases but
is insensitive in AlexNet, i.e., the coverage does not change on both adversarial examples and
natural error of AlexNet, which indicates that the DNN may have a large impact on LSC. DSC is
not sensitive on natural errors while it is better on adversarial examples. It is worth pointing out
that most coverage criteria tend to have irregular changes in AE (AlexNet) while SNPC still has an
increasing trend.

Considering IDC that is also based on LRP, we can observe that the coverage increase is not
as stable as SNPC and ANPC, e.g., on Nat.(AlexNet), AE (SADL-2), AE (AlexNet) and AE (IVGG).
Although both IDC and NPC adopt LRP to identify the critical neurons layer by layer, NPC is more
fine-grained than IDC, i.e., NPC performs the CDP-based clustering in each class. Thus, our results
tend to be more stable.

Moreover, we also observe that there are some correlations between these coverage. Specifically,
the trend of coverage increase with regards to different coverage criteria could be similar. For
example, in Nat.(SDAL-1), LSC, DSC, ANPC and SNPC have the similar trend. In Nat.(SADL-2),
SNPC and NC have the similar trend. Most of the coverage criteria have the similar trend in
Nat.(VGG16), Nat.(IVGG) and AE(SADL-1).

Answer to RQ3: Overall, ANPC and SNPC are more sensitive to different errors than other
coverage criteria due to the CDP awareness. Different coverage criteria could achieve similar
increasing trend, indicating that they tend to have some correlation.

4.7 RQ4: Correlation with Output Impartiality
As described in [2, 20, 51], the test data or errors should be diverse in terms of the output. The
existing work [42] has demonstrated that the coverage (e.g., neuron coverage) can be improved by
a few samples. However, a test suite that only contains one category of samples (e.g., dog) is not
enough to comprehensively reveal diverse defects of the DNN (e.g., the errors in other categories).
In addition, the coverage criteria are usually used to guide the test case generation. The coverage
criteria that are sensitive to output diversity can guide the testing tools to generate more diverse
test cases belonging to different categories while the insensitive coverage criteria may generate
biased test cases [51]. Hence, we evaluate the correlation between the coverage criteria and the
output diversity in this section.

Setup. We follow the same setting in [20] and use the proposed tool to generate a number of test

suites, which have the same size. Specifically, it mainly contains three steps:

(1) For each dataset, we randomly select two seed test suites with different size (i.e., 100 and 500).

(2) Based on each seed test suite, we adopt the tool [20] to generate new test suites that have the
same size with the seed test suite (i.e., generate new input by perturbing each input of the seed
test suites). The tool [20] extends the existing adversarial attacks (e.g., C&W [6] and PGD [34])
with the divergence function such that more diverse test cases can be generated. By setting
different configurations (e.g., diversity regularization weight, confidence), multiple test suites
can be generated. For each seed test suite on SADL-1, SADL-2, VGG-16 (CIFAR-10) and AlexNet,
we generate 48, 171, 167 and 168 new test suites3, respectively. Note that, we did not include
the results of ImageNet in this experiment because all adversarial examples generated by the
tool [20] belong to the same class, which makes all correlation scores as NaN.

(3) For a generated test suite, we calculate the coverage and the output diversity, respectively.

Finally, we calculate the Pearson correlation between them.
Specifically, we use the output impartiality metric [20] for a test suite 𝑇 :

𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡_𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝑇 ) =

(cid:205)𝑡 ∈𝐶𝑘

𝑃𝑡 =𝐶𝑘𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑃𝑡 =𝐶𝑘
1
|𝑐 |

𝑙𝑜𝑔 1
|𝑐 |

where |𝐶 | is the cardinality of classes and 𝑃𝑡 =𝐶𝑘 represents the percentage of the test cases 𝑡
predicted to belong to class 𝐶𝑘 .

Results. Table 6 shows the correlation on different models. The overall results demonstrated
that, compared with existing coverage criteria, ANPC and SNPC are more strongly correlated
with the output impartiality. In particular, we have the following findings:1) Compared with the
test suite with smaller size (e.g., 100), the correlation can be stronger when the size of the test
cases becomes larger (i.e., 500). For example, for the size 500, ANPC and SNPC are positively
and strongly correlated with the output impartiality in all models while there are some negative
correlations in the size 100. KMNC is also positively correlated with output impartially when the
size is 500. 2) Considering the results of ANPC and SNPC, we found that SNPC is more strongly
correlated with output comparability. It is because ANPC is more fine-grained and could capture
the minor activation difference (i.e., coverage increase) even when they have output bias (i.e., the
same prediction output).

For the results that ANPC and SNPC achieve negative correlation (e.g., -0.244 on SADL-1, -0.055
on VGG16) when the size of the test suite is 100, our in-depth analysis reveals that, for some test
suites with smaller size, the prediction outputs of the test cases are biased (e.g., these test cases are
predicted as the same class), which caused the low output impartiality. However, these samples
can still trigger different CDPs (i.e., different similarities compared with the corresponding CDP),
which lead to high coverage. Hence, the correlation is negative. When the size becomes larger (e.g.,
500), the test suite becomes more stable (i.e., the prediction results are less biased), which makes
that the coverage is positively correlated with the output impartiality.

We also observe that the correlation of IDC is higher than other baselines but it is still less than
ANPC and SNPC. The average correlation scores of IDC are less than ANPC and SNPC. For example,
when the size is 100, the average score of IDC is 0.298 while the average scores of ANPC and SNPC
are 0.601 and 0.612, respectively. Except for VGG16 (size=100), all correlation scores of SNPC are
larger than IDC. The results indicate the effectiveness of our fine-grained coverage criteria.

Answer to RQ4: Generally, ANPC and SNPC are positively correlated with the output impar-
tiality. The model and the size of test suite could affect the correlation.

3The number of test suites is different because it depends on the number of configurations in [20] (i.e., a new test suite is
generated by a configuration), where one variable in the configurations is the layers of the neuron network.

4.8 RQ5: Efficiency of NPC
We use the same dataset from RQ3 and compare the time overhead of calculating the coverage of a
test suite (i.e., 1000 samples). Note that, except for NC, all other coverage criteria depend on the
training samples and there are some prepossessing process. For example, KMNC and NBC need
to profile the training data. LSC and DSC need to calculate all activation values of the training
data. ANPC and SNPC need to calculate the CDPs for all training data. IDC also requires the LRP
calculation for all training data. Since the prepossessing phase can be executed only once and it is
usually calculated offline, we ignore the time of the prepossessing and only compare the coverage
calculation time for a given test set.

Table 7 shows the results. We found that, NC (with the threshold 0.0) is the most efficient one as
it only depends on the neuron output. For ANPC and SNPC, we list the total time and the CDP
path extraction time (the number in brackets).The results show that the path extraction is efficient.
Compared with others, ANPC and SNPC take more time since more information are required
(i.e., the CDP calculation). IDC is more efficient because it only calculates the distance between
the critical neuron values of the test cases and the training samples at one layer. Actually, it is a
trade-off between effectiveness (i.e., leveraging more information) and the efficiency.

Answer to RQ5: Although ANPC and SNPC adopt the interpretation analysis, the time
overhead is not expensive. The CDP extraction is efficient and it only takes a proportion in
the total time overhead of the coverage calculation.

5 THREATS TO VALIDITY AND DISCUSSION

Threats to Validity. The internal threats to validity lies in our implementations including the
LRP implementation, the path extraction, the path abstraction, the coverage criteria and the
implementation in each experiment. To reduce this threat, the co-authors carefully checked the
correctness of our implementation.

The external threats to validity include the selection of the subjects and the tools used in the
evaluation. Specifically, the selection of datasets and the used models could be a threat. To reduce
this threat, we selected four widely-used subjects (MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN and ImageNet) and 4
DNNs (SADL-1, SADL-2, VGG-16 and AlexNet), where ImageNet is a large-scale dataset. Another
threat could be the generated data including adversarial examples, the selected natural errors and
test suites (in RQ3, RQ4 and RQ5). To mitigate this threat, we follow the same setting in the existing
work [20, 28] and generate diverse data with multiple configurations. In addition, the usage of the
existing tool [20] can be a threat. Since our method, the used models and the tool [20] are developed
by PyTorch, we manually re-implement the tool [15, 23] by PyTorch, which may not the exactly
the same with the original version. We integrate our method, LSC, DSC, NC, KMNC and NBC into
the tool [20] to evaluate the correlation. We carefully checked the code to mitigate the threat.

22

The construct threats mainly lie in the randomness, the selected baselines, the parameters. First,
one threat is the randomness in the selection of the data. To mitigate the treat, in RQ3, we repeat
each experiment 5 times (e.g., the generation of adversarial examples) and calculate the average
results. In RQ4, we follow the setting [20] and generate a large number of test suites to reduce the
randomness. Second, we adopted the state-of-the-art approaches that have been demonstrated to be
insufficient in DL testing. We compare our method with them to demonstrate the advantages of our
proposed coverage criteria. Thirdly, the hyper-parameters in our methods and the baselines could
be a threat to validity. To reduce the threat, for the baselines, we follow the settings in the existing
works [20, 23, 31]. For our method, we set multiple configurations in terms of the hyper-parameters
𝛼, 𝛽 and the number of clusters 𝑘. However, in RQ3 and RQ4, we select the same values of 𝛼, 𝛽 and
𝑘 for all paths and classes. Actually, we can select the optimal configurations by adopting different
𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝑘. In the future, we plan to evaluate our method with more configurations.

Limitation. Like the coverage criteria in traditional software, we think there is no one best
coverage criterion and each one has some limitations. The main advantage of NPC lies in its
interpretability and the clear relationship with the internal decision of the DNN. In this section, we
summarize our limitations and discuss the potential solutions in the future.

• Currently, our approach mainly considers the classification since the current interpretation
technique (i.e., LRP) does not support the DNN with regression prediction. Even though the
used interpretation technique is orthogonal to our approach, our approach is general as long
as the critical neurons could be calculated. We believe the interpretation techniques that
work on regression tasks in the future will further solve this limitation.

• Our approach mainly works on feed-forward neural networks. For recurrent neural networks
(RNNs), whose number of iterations is not fixed, it could be challenging for the interpretation
technique (e.g., relevance calculation in LRP). In the future, we may extend LRP by unrolling
the RNN to address this limitation.

• There is another limitation on the selection for the number of the clusters during the path
abstraction. Currently, we select the same number for all classes, which may not be the
optimal setting. In the future, we will investigate the automated selection on this parameter.

6 RELATED WORK
This section summarizes the related work on DL testing and adversarial attacks.

6.1 DL Testing
DeepXplore [39] proposes the first white-box coverage criteria, i.e., Neuron Coverage, which
calculates the percentage of activated neurons. A differential testing approach is proposed to
detect the errors by increasing NC. DeepGauge [31] then extends NC and proposes a set of more
fine-grained coverage criteria by considering the distribution of neuron outputs from training data.

Inspired by the coverage criteria in traditional software testing, some coverage metrics [30, 32, 43]
are proposed. DeepCover [43] proposes the MC/DC coverage of DNNs based on the dependence
between neurons in adjacent layers. DeepCT [30] adopts the combinatorial testing idea and proposes
a coverage metric that considers the combination of different neurons at each layer. DeepMutation
[32] adopts the mutation testing into DL testing and proposes a set of operators to generate mutants
of the DNN. Furthermore, Sekhon et al. [42] analyzed the limitation of exiting coverage criteria
and proposed a more fine-grained coverage metric that considers both of the relationships between
two adjacent layers and the combinations of values of neurons at each layer.

NPC: Neuron Path Coverage via Characterizing Decision Logic of Deep Neural Networks

23

Based on the neuron coverage, DeepPath [48] initially proposes the path-driven coverage criteria,
which considers the sequentially linked connections of the DNN. Although both of DeepPath and
our method focus on path-based coverage, the approach and the underlying principles are totally
different. The path in DeepPath is the syntactic connections between neurons in different layers
and the semantics of the path is unknown. Differently, we adopt the interpretation techniques to
define paths, in which the neurons are selected based on the relevance with the decision. Thus,
CDPs have more clear semantics, i.e., they are related to the decision logic.

The aforementioned techniques mainly consider syntactic structure of DNN, which is black-box
and hard to understand. Differently, Kim et al. [23] proposed the coverage criteria that measure the
surprise of the inputs. The assumption is that surprising inputs introduce more diverse data such
that more behaviors could be tested. Surprise metric measures the surprise score by considering all
neuron outputs of one or several layers. It is still unclear how the surprise coverage (calculated from
some layers) is related to the decision logic. Differently, our method not only selects the critical
neurons at each layer but also considers the relationships between layers.

Based on the these criteria, some automated testing techniques [11, 37, 39, 43, 46, 51, 55] are
proposed to generate test inputs towards increasing the coverage. In addition, while the coverage
criteria are widely studied, the existing work [10, 13, 20, 28, 42, 52] found some preliminary evidence
about the limitation of the structural criteria. For example, the coverage is too coarse and is not
correlated to the defect detection and robustness. Such findings motivate this work that proposes
interpretable coverage criteria by extracting the semantic structure (i.e., the decision graph).

Recently, some coverage criteria [1, 15] are also proposed based on the decision of the DNN. The
technique [1] adopts the explanation technique LIME [40] to extract a decision tree that explains
the decision of the DNN on an input. Based on the decision tree, the symbolic execution is used to
generate test cases that can maximize the path coverage on the decision tree. Different with [1], we
extract the decision graph that could represent the global decision behaviors of the DNN. Moreover,
in [1], it mainly focuses on the problem of fairness evaluation while it is hard to extract such a
decision tree on the high dimensional data such as image domain. IDC [15] adopts the interpretation
technique to select the important neurons in one layer. Based on the training data, it then groups
the activation values of important neurons into a set of clusters and uses the clusters to measure
the coverage. Similar with our technique, IDC also selects the critical neurons. Differently, NPC
considers the relations between layers and proposes the path-based coverage instead of only one
layer. Thus, NPC does not need to select one of the target layers. In addition, we propose two
different path coverage criteria from the control flow and data flow of the DNN. Significantly,
there are also two papers [53] and [27] extracting critical neurons to represent decision behaviors.
However, they focus on adversarial attacks and there are relatively larger computation costs.
Except for the testing on the trained model, some techniques (e.g., [50]) have been proposed to
build the self-checking system that can monitor DNN output and trigger an alarm if the output
is likely to be incorrect after the model is deployed. For more relevant discussions on the recent
progress of machine learning testing, we refer the interesting readers to the recent comprehensive
survey [54].

6.2 Adversarial Attacks
Recently, there are many adversarial attack techniques such as adversarial noise attacks including
FGSM [16], JSMA [38], BIM [25], DeepFool [35], and C&W [6], and natural degradation-based
adversarial attacks including ABBA [17], SPARK [18], AVA [45], and Pasadena [8]. The adversarial
examples are generated by adding visually imperceptible perturbation to an input such that the new
input is misclassified. It is worth to think and discuss about the difference between deep learning
testing and adversarial attacks. The common thing is that both the testing and attack could test

24

the robustness of the model by generating incorrect inputs. Differently, the adversarial attack is
ad-hoc and generates the specific adversarial examples based on gradient calculation. DL testing
aims to test the DNN more systematically by exploring more decision logic of the model. Thus,
the errors generated by DL testing are expected to be more diverse (i.e., triggering different logic)
than adversarial attacks. For example, given one input, the attack techniques usually generate the
similar adversarial examples while DL testing could generate different adversarial examples with
the guidance of the coverage criteria.

7 CONCLUSION
Motivated by the recent findings [10, 20, 28] about the limitation of the existing DL testing criteria,
this paper proposes the neuron path coverage via extracting the decision structure of the targeted
DNN. For a DNN, we extract the decision logic based on the critical decision paths from the training
data. Two path-based coverage criteria are then proposed to measure whether new decision logic
is covered by the test cases. Specifically, SNPC is designed based on the control-flow of the DNN
which measures whether different critical neurons are covered; ANPC is designed based on the
data-flow of the DNN which measures the activation values of the critical neurons. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes the interpretable coverage criteria from the
control-flow and data-flow of the DNN. The evaluation results demonstrated the effectiveness of
the CDP in the decision revealing of the DNN and the usefulness of the coverage criteria.
