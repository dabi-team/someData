ABSTRACT

CzeV343 (=V849 Aur) was previously identiﬁed as a candidate double eclipsing binary (2+2 quadruple), where the orbital periods
of the two eclipsing binaries (PA ≈ 1.2 days and PB ≈ 0.8 days) lie very close to 3:2 resonance. Here, we analyze 11 years of
ground-based photometry, 4 sectors of TESS 2-minute and full-frame photometry, and two optical spectra. We construct a global
model of our photometry, including apsidal motion of binary A and light-travel time eﬀect (LTTE) of the mutual outer orbit, and
explore the parameter space with Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We estimate component masses for binary A (1.8 + 1.3 M(cid:12)) and binary
B (1.4 + 1.2 M(cid:12)). We identify pseudo-synchronous rotation signal of binary A in TESS photometry. We detect apsidal motion in
binary A with a period of about 33 years, which is fully explained by tidal and rotational contributions of stars aligned with the
orbit. The mutual orbit has a period of about 1450 days and eccentricity of about 0.7. The LTTE amplitude is small, which points
to low inclination of the outer orbit and a high degree of misalignment with the inner orbits. We ﬁnd that when apsidal motion and
mutual orbit are taken into account the orbital period resonance is exact to within 10−5 cycles/day. Many properties of CzeV343 are
not compatible with requirements of the 3:2 resonance capture theory for coplanar orbits. Future evolution of CzeV343 can lead to
mergers, triple common envelope, double white dwarf binaries, or a Type Ia supernova. More complex evolutionary pathways will
likely arise from dynamical instability caused by orbital expansion when either of the binaries undergoes mass transfer. This instability
has not been so far explored in 2+2 quadruples.

1. Introduction

Double eclipsing binaries (DEBs) are quadruple (2+2) stellar
systems composed of two eclipsing binaries on a mutual or-
bit. The number of known DEBs has recently tremendously in-
creased and the total sample of DEB candidates currently in-
cludes approximately 300 objects (Pawlak et al. 2013; Zasche
et al. 2019, 2022b; Kostov et al. 2022). Relative frequency of
DEBs on narrow orbits remains unknown, but DEBs on wide or-
bits are approximately 7 times more frequent than what would
be expected from random pairings (Fezenko et al. 2022) and in
general quadruples of 2+2 hierarchy are over-represented among
multiple stellar systems (Tokovinin 2014).

In most cases, the mutual orbit is unresolved in optical
ground-based imaging and the orbital parameters are uncon-
strained. For some objects, it was possible to constrain the mu-
tual orbit with light travel time eﬀect (LTTE) or with dynami-
cal perturbations to the inner orbits. For example, Zasche et al.
(2020) estimated outer orbital period in CzeV1731 to about 34
years. Most of DEBs characterized so far are compatible with
aligned inner and outer orbits. Zasche & Uhlaˇr (2013) claimed

that V994 Her has high inclination between the inner binaries
and the mutual orbit, but later update by Zasche & Uhlaˇr (2016)
showed that angular momenta of all three orbits lie in the plane
of the sky. Kostov et al. (2021) found that all three orbits of
TIC 454140642 are very well aligned and Borkovits et al. (2021)
estimated that orbits in BG Ind are closely aligned. Although the
DEB statistics is small, we would expect at least some objects
with misaligned orbits similarly to what was found by Borkovits
et al. (2015) for stellar triples.

Relative frequency of diﬀerent evolutionary pathways possi-
ble in 2+2 quadruples can diﬀer from analogous triples, where
one of the binaries is replaced by a single star. Completely new
evolutionary pathways are also possible. Pejcha et al. (2013)
performed direct integration of 2+2 quadruple orbits in the
context of von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai cycles acting on both in-
ner binaries and found increased frequency of chaotic interac-
tions, high-eccentricity encounters, collisions, and other inter-
esting phenomena. This ﬁnding was conﬁrmed with a secular
model by Vokrouhlický (2016). Later, Hamers & Lai (2017) ap-
plied the secular model to hot Jupiters and Fang et al. (2018) to

white dwarf mergers and Type Ia supernovae. Dynamics of 2+2
quadruples was further developed by Hamers (2019), Hamers
et al. (2021a), Fragione & Kocsis (2019), Liu & Lai (2019), and
Vynatheya & Hamers (2022) in the context of Type Ia super-
novae, and neutron star and black hole mergers.

There are a number of open questions connected with the for-
mation and evolution of 2+2 quadruples. One particularly strik-
ing feature is that in many DEBs the orbital periods of the two
inner binaries, PA and PB, appear in or near integer resonances.
Unlike various types of dynamical perturbations between the or-
bits that are commonly studied in multiple stellar systems, pe-
riod resonances are by principle absent in the dynamics of triples
and are unique to 2+2 quadruples. To our knowledge, the ﬁrst
suggestion of a pair of interacting binaries with period ratio 3:2
was made by Oﬁr (2008) for BI 108, a massive stellar system in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (Kołaczkowski et al. 2013). Cagaš
& Pejcha (2012) presented the discovery of CzeV343 (=V849
Aur), which was classiﬁed as a DEB composed of two detached
binaries with periods of PA ≈ 1.2 and PB ≈ 0.8 days and pe-
riod ratio1 very close to 3:2 resonance. V994 Her is somewhat
farther from the 3:2 resonance, but its physical properties and
parameters of the mutual orbit are relatively well known (Lee
et al. 2008; Zasche & Uhlaˇr 2013, 2016).

Zasche et al. (2019) collected DEBs known at that time and
claimed an excess of DEBs with period ratios of 3:2 and 1:1.
Other DEBs were identiﬁed very close to other resonances of
small integers such as 5:3 and 4:1 (Zasche et al. 2022a,b). More
recently, Kostov et al. (2022) did not ﬁnd any excess of period
resonances in a sample of 97 DEBs identiﬁed in the data from
the TESS satellite. The discrepancies in the published resonance
statistics could arise due to diﬀerent detection methods. So far,
most of the DEB discoveries signiﬁcantly rely to some extent on
human factor, which might bias the detection eﬃciency. For ex-
ample, near resonance of the two orbital periods can create light
curve patterns that are more easily spotted by the human eye,
which might lead to higher detection fraction near such period
ratios. Addressing the issue of resonance statistics is beyond the
scope of this work, but we note that in many cases it is not even
clear how to quantify the distance of the period ratio from a res-
onance and how to reliably identify resonant DEBs.

There are only two works addressing the theory of reso-
nant orbits in quadruple stars. Breiter & Vokrouhlický (2018)
used canonical perturbation methods to construct a secular res-
onant model of coplanar binaries in 1:1 resonance. They con-
cluded that the capture to 1:1 resonance is unlikely. Tremaine
(2020) extended the analysis to 3:2 and 2:1 resonances of copla-
nar orbits, where the resonant conditions include frequency of
the mutual orbit and the rate of apsidal motion of one of the bi-
naries. Tremaine (2020) also derived several conditions on suc-
cessful capture that include relative rate of tidal and orbital evo-
lution of the individual binaries, and the eccentricities of the in-
ner orbits and their evolution. Tremaine (2020) concluded that
CzeV343 and BI 108 are likely captured in the 3:2 resonance,
while V994 Her is not, however, the observed eccentricities in
some of these systems remain too high to be compatible with
resonant capture.

In this paper, we revisit CzeV343, which was one of the ﬁrst
objects suggested to populate the 3:2 period resonance by Cagaš
& Pejcha (2012). Our goal is to characterize the properties of the
system in light of new data and to evaluate how closely CzeV343

and binary B the binary with shorter period. This convention is opposite
to the one used by Tremaine (2020).

satisﬁes theoretical resonant conditions of Tremaine (2020). In
Section 2, we present new ground-based and TESS photometry
as well as two spectra. In Section 3, we describe the modeling
procedure for photometric and spectroscopic data. In Section 4,
we present our results on apsidal motion, mutual orbit, rotation
periods, and period resonance. In Section 5, we discuss implica-
tions of our constraints on resonant capture and future evolution
of the system. We summarize our ﬁndings in Section 6.

2. Observations

In this section, we discuss the properties and reduction process
of our observations of CzeV343. We present ground-based pho-
tometry (Sect. 2.1), TESS 2-min photometry (Sect. 2.2), TESS
full-frame images (Sect. 2.3), and two optical spectra (Sect. 2.4).

2.1. Ground-based data

We have been monitoring CzeV343 continuously since its dis-
covery. Our instrumentation is similar to what was used by Cagaš
& Pejcha (2012), but virtually all components of the observing
setup have been upgraded over time. The 0.25 m telescope was
replaced with a new 0.30 m one in 2015. Also, the Kodak KAF-
16803 CCD based G4-16000 camera was replaced with a new
C4-16000 camera equipped with more sensitive GSENSE4040
scientiﬁc CMOS sensor in 2020 and a year later with another
C3-61000 camera based on Sony IMX455 CMOS sensor, which
has even higher quantum eﬃciency and lower read noise. Image
reduction and photometry was performed using freely-available
software package Simple Image Processing System (SIPS). SIPS
has become widely used by citizen scientists to process images
and photometry of time-variable sources, but its algorithms and
features have not yet been described in the literature. In Ap-
pendix A, we address this deﬁciency and describe some of the
capabilities of SIPS.

In total, we have accumulated 12 257 photometric measure-
ments in 99 observing nights covering years 2012 to 2022. The
median number of measurements in one night is 96, but it has
increased to more than 200 after the technical upgrades. The rea-
son is that larger telescope and more sensitive detectors allowed
reduction of the exposure time and thus increase of the image
cadence. We also adjusted the observing program by starting
to measure CzeV343 earlier each season to better utilize long
winter nights when CzeV343 was above the horizon. The me-
dian photometric uncertainty is 0.006 mag. We correct magni-
tude oﬀsets between individual nights in our global photometric
model described in Section 3.2. In Figure 1, we show three of
our ground-based light curves obtained on consecutive nights.
Appendix B provides a list of our photometric measurements
(Table B.1) and plots of all our light curves (Figs. B.1 and B.2).

2.2. TESS 2-minute photometry

TESS observed CzeV343 with 2-min cadence in Sectors 43, 44,
and 45 based on Cycle 4 program G04105 (PI Pejcha). We used
Lightkurve package (Lightkurve Collaboration et al. 2018) to
download the Target Pixel Files and to extract the aperture pho-
tometry using the default mask. Observations in each TESS sec-
tor have a break in the middle and as a result the data are nat-
urally divided into six segments. To mask data aﬀected by in-
strumental eﬀects, we removed points taken within 0.75 days of
the approximate midpoints between segments. We also remove
the ﬁrst and last 0.5 days of observations. To facilitate joint ﬁt-

model, both datasets were aligned vertically to match the double eclipsing binary light curve models, which are shown separately for the two
datasets (solid and dashed orange lines).

ting with ground-based data, we convert the ﬂuxes and uncer-
tainties to magnitudes. In total, we retain 43 453 data points.
The median photometric uncertainty is 0.009 mag. We ﬁnd that
magnitude oﬀsets of individual segments are the only required
additional correction and we ﬁt the magnitude oﬀsets together
with our DEB model presented in Section 3.2. In Figure 1, we
show an excerpt from our 2-min light curve along with simulta-
neously taken ground-based data. All light curves are shown in
Appendix C (Figs. C.1 and C.2).

2.3. TESS full-frame images

TESS also recorded CzeV343 on full-frame images (FFI) in Sec-
tor 19. Since we took very few ground-based data in that observ-
ing season, we decided to include the FFI observations despite
the stronger instrumental signals aﬀecting the photometry. We
used Lightkurve to download 20 × 20 pixel cutouts from FFIs,
and performed aperture photometry with a 3 × 3 pixel square
aperture centered on CzeV343. We masked data at the begin-
ning, the end, and around the middle of the sector with the same
algorithm as for the 2-min data. We retain a total of 1006 mea-
surements. To correct for instrumental eﬀects, we selected 196
background pixels using the threshold method and found the ﬁrst
15 orthogonal principal vectors, PCA j. Since the amplitude and
timescale of CzeV343 variability are similar to instrumental ef-
fects, we cannot simply ﬁt and subtract the PCA vectors. Instead,
we ﬁt the coeﬃcients together with our binary model on the ﬂux
level as explained in Section 3.2. We ignore the smearing of the
light curves introduced by the FFI 30-min exposure time. Our
FFI light curves corrected for instrumental eﬀects are shown in
Appendix C (Fig. C.3).

2.4. Spectra

On October 7 2012 12:07 UTC we obtained a single 10-minute
spectrum with the OSMOS spectrograph on the 2.4m Hiltner
telescope at MDM Observatory. Unfortunately, spectra of wave-
length calibration lamps were not obtained on this night due to
technical problems. We used the calibration information avail-
able on the instrument website2 to get a crude wavelength cor-
rection. We also obtained a rough ﬂux calibration by comparing
to the spectrum of Feige 110 obtained during the same observ-
ing run. We manually removed artifacts due to cosmics and dead

3.1. O-C analysis of photometry

We use the freely available SImple LIght CUrve Processing Sys-
tem (SILICUPS) described in Appendix A to determine minima
timings of both binaries in CzeV343. The timings are obtained
by ﬁtting analytical functions to light curve segments. In Fig-
ure 4, we show the resulting O − C diagram with respect to best-
ﬁt ephemeris with constant period. We see that in binary A the
primary and secondary minima are diverging, which is a clear
sign of apsidal motion. In the last three seasons we can recognize
that the trends of primary and secondary minima are starting to
turn back together, which implies that the apsidal motion period
is around 30 to 40 years. In addition, we see that there are wig-
gles occuring in phase for both primary and secondary minima.
Binary B has circular orbit and does not show signs of apsidal
motion. Instead, we see an oscillating pattern with a timescale
of about 1500 days and an amplitude of about 0.002 days, which
has opposite phase than the wiggles seen in binary A.

It is likely that the wiggles seen in both A and B are related
to the mutual orbit, but it is not immediately clear whether the
signal is due to light-travel time eﬀect (LTTE) delay (Roemer
eﬀect) or due to dynamic perturbation to the orbits of the inner
binaries. According to Borkovits et al. (2015), the amplitude of
LTTE of binary A is

tual orbit with respect to the observer. Borkovits et al. (2015)

timescale of PAB to binary A as

On January 29 2013 07:21 UTC we obtained a single 20-
minute exposure of CzeV343 with the echelle spectrograph on
the 3.5 m telescope at the Apache Point Observatory. The spec-
trum was processed in a standard way in IRAF echelle package.
The individual echelle orders were interpolated on a common
wavelength scale and the ﬂux from overlapping orders was co-
added. The spectrum is similar to our OSMOS spectrum in the
sense that it shows broad Balmer absorption lines. In Figure 3,
we show proﬁles of Balmer series lines. Unfortunately, the lines
are often spread over multiple echelle orders, which leads to
instrumental waves superimposed on the line proﬁles and pre-
cludes proper disentanglement of the individual components.

3. Analysis

In this Section, we describe our analysis of photometric mea-
surements starting with the classical O − C analysis (Sect. 3.1),
which motivates the full photometric model (Sect. 3.2). We also
present the spectral classiﬁcation (Sect. 3.3) and stellar proper-
ties from Gaia DR3 (Sect. 3.4).

where eA is the eccentricity of binary A.

Comparing these expressions to the amplitude seen in Fig-
ure 4, we see that dynamical perturbations are too small to ex-
plain the observed variations. The signal comes from LTTE, but
the observed amplitude is signiﬁcantly smaller than the maxi-
mum value. This implies that the mutual orbit is seen quite face-
on. We quantify this ﬁnding and discuss its implications in Sec-
tion 4.4.

3.2. Global model of photometry

Light curves of the two eclipsing binaries in a DEB overlap,
which leads to complex features and complicates interpretation
of the observations. In DEBs with near-resonant periods, the
alignment of the features slowly drifts, which can bias minima
timings obtained in a traditional way. For example, when binary
A slowly brightens (for example due to ellipsoidal variations)
over the course of the eclipse of binary B then ﬁtting of minima
of B will be biased if the variation from the other binary is not
simultaneously accounted for. Eﬀects like these might contribute
to relatively high scatter seen in the Figure 4.

To properly characterize properties of CzeV343, we extend
the analysis presented by Cagaš & Pejcha (2012) to include ap-
sidal motion, mutual orbit, and simultaneous ﬁtting of all types
of photometric data. In our model, the magnitude at time ti is
(cid:88)

where Ftot is the total ﬂux from the system, c j are coeﬃcients
describing magnitude oﬀsets of each segment (either one ground
observing night or one half of TESS sector), and ∆i j is unity for
ti within segment j and zero otherwise. The total ﬂux is

Ftot(ti) = (1 − F5)(1 − β)FA(t(cid:48)

where FA and FB are ﬂuxes of binaries A and B, β parameterizes
relative ﬂux of A and B, F5 accounts for any additional light such

as due to an additional unresolved component or blending with
nearby stars, and b j are coeﬃcients that project the residuals of
the binary model to the principal component vectors PCA j in
TESS FFI data, which is facilitated by setting δFFI to unity for
TESS FFI data and to zero otherwise. The model is constructed
to ensure that the normalization of the total ﬂux does not depend
on the actual values of β and F5.

To take into account LTTE, we evaluate the binary ﬂuxes at

where νAB is the true anomaly, which is related to PAB by the
Kepler equation. We omitted the last term in the Irwin (1952)
expression, because it only introduces constant shift in time.
We use Kepler equation solver3 extracted from the package
exoplanet (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2021).

To calculate FA and FB we use the eclipsing binary model
eb4 (Irwin et al. 2011), which is based on JKTEBOP (Etzel
1981; Southworth et al. 2004, 2007, 2009; Southworth 2010).
Each binary model is parameterized by the epoch of primary
conjuction T0, orbital period P, central surface brightness ratio
Θ, sum r1 + r2 and ratio r1/r2 of relative radii, cosine of incli-
nation cos i, photometric mass ratio q, and two eccentricity pa-
rameters e cos ω and e sin ω. For binary A we also include the
apsidal precession rate dω/dt. We use standard values appropri-
ate for early type stars of limb darkening (u1 = 0.05, u2 = 0.6),
gravity darkening (0.25), and albedo (0.4).

where mi and σi are observed magnitudes and their uncertain-
ties at time ti. Because the ground-based and TESS data have
diﬀerent spectral response, we ﬁt separate β and F5 for each of
these datasets. Similarly, we should also ﬁt separately the surface
brightness ratio Θ, but we ﬁnd that in such case q and r1/r2 be-
come unconstrained for ground-based data. Instead, we ﬁnd that
using joint Θ leads to more stable ﬁts that still suﬃciently well
model both datasets. In total, our model has 152 free parameters.

for a total of 56 564 degrees of freedom. The contributions of
individual datasets to the joint χ2 are: ground-based χ2 = 12 838
for 12 257 points, TESS 2-min χ2 = 49 681 for 43 453 points,
and TESS FFI χ2 = 1028 for 1006 points. These numbers
indicate that none of the datasets has its uncertainties under- or
overestimated and that each dataset contributes to the ﬁnal χ2
proportionally to its size. We illustrate the best-ﬁt model of the
light curves in Figure 1 and we visualize all ﬁts in Appendices B
and C.

With the best-ﬁt values as a starting point, we explore the
distribution of likelihood ln L = −χ2/2 in the space of param-
eters with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) package
emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). We ﬁnd that it is not fea-
sible to directly explore the full 152-dimensional space due to
the memory requirements of emcee. However, majority of the
free parameters are coeﬃcients c j, which are simply oﬀsets of
individual segments. We modify the likelihood function so that
c j are determined simply as a weighted-mean oﬀset of each seg-
ment from the model described by the remaining parameters.
This reduces the dimension for MCMC exploration to 30 without
fundamental loss of information, which we veriﬁed with shorter
chains run on the full parameter space. With our modiﬁed likeli-
hood, we set uniform priors for all parameters and run 90 chains
for 500 000 steps each. The autocorrelation length of the chains
is about 1000 steps. Projected distributions of the posterior are
shown in Appendix D.

In Table 1, we report the results of our model and its un-
certainties. We report the median value of each parameter from
the Markov chains after discarding the initial 10 000 steps and
thinning by 1000. The conﬁdence intervals capture 95.4% of the

probability. In the rest of the paper, we quote the same conﬁ-
dence interval for quantities based on our photometric model
unless stated otherwise. Our results are broadly consistent with
values previously reported by Cagaš & Pejcha (2012) with one
exception. Cagaš & Pejcha (2012) reported eA = 0.18, but we
ﬁnd eA = 0.11. This can be explained by the limited timespan
of the earlier work, when the phase of the apsidal motion was
very close to 0.5 and the eccentricity was constrained only by
the eclipse duration rather than eclipse timing. Here, we have
covered a substantial fraction of the apsidal motion cycle, which
gives us a more robust determination of eA. We caution that pa-
rameters like Θ, q, and r1/r2 are partially degenerate, especially
in the case of binary B, and the values we obtained are likely not
robust. Nonetheless, this is not a signiﬁcant problem for us, be-
cause we are primarily interested in the timing properties, where
these parameters do not play a role. We will discuss physical
parameters of the binaries in Sect. 4.1.

We note that the uncertainties on quantities like dωA/dt and
PAB are relatively small, especially considering that the timespan
of our observations covers about two cycles of PAB and about a
third of the apsidal motion cycle of binary A. One possible expla-
nation is that the MCMC analysis is not suﬃciently converged,
but we veriﬁed that the length of our Markov chains suﬃciently
exceeds their autocorrelation scale. Another possible explana-
tion is that in our global model timing of all individual measure-
ments enters the solution, whereas classical O − C analysis is
performed on a much smaller number of derived quantities with
potentially additional noise introduced by the intermediate layer
of minima ﬁtting. Alternatively, there might be red noise that is
not fully taken into account in our model as was found in a sim-
ilar analysis by Torres et al. (2017).

Finally, both Cagaš & Pejcha (2012) and us ﬁnd substan-
tial amount of constant additional light in CzeV343. This could
be caused by inadequacy of the binary model, which does not
appropriately reproduce the observations especially around min-
ima. Alternatively, there is an additional component in CzeV343,
which would make it a quintuple star similar to V994 Her (Za-
sche & Uhlaˇr 2016). However, Cagaš & Pejcha (2012) did not
ﬁnd any photocenter variations, which means that the angular
distance of the hypothetical additional component must be small.
The higher value of F5 in TESS data can be explained either by
red color of the ﬁfth star or as additional ﬂux from nearby stars.
In any case, this ﬁnding is not important for our subsequent anal-
ysis and we will therefore not discuss F5 again.

3.3. Spectra

We use the package PyHammer (Kesseli et al. 2017; Roulston
et al. 2020) to match our OSMOS spectrum to a library of spec-
tral templates. The best match is to an A7 template at metallicity
[Fe/H] = −1.5. We consider such low metallicity unlikely5, al-
though CzeV343 is located 3.7+0.4
−0.2 kpc away almost exactly op-
posite to the Milky Way center (b = 1.5◦, l = 178◦) (Bailer-Jones
et al. 2021). PyHammer does not allow constraints on metallicity
during ﬁts, but in Figure 2 we compare our spectrum to several
solar-metallicity templates. We see that still our spectrum best
resembles late-A stars.

Our APO spectrum is unfortunately not useful for spectral
classiﬁcation, because it is not ﬂux-calibrated and the broad ab-
sorption lines often cover multiple Echelle orders, which leads

5 Alternatively, low metallicity could be explained by the λ Boo phe-
nomenon in A-type stars, which manifests by depletion of iron but rel-
atively normal abundances of many other elements.

to artiﬁcial wiggles. However, the high resolution of the spec-
trum allows us to get an independent estimate of the reddening
from the equivalent width of Na I D lines. We used Poznanski
et al. (2012) relations for both sodium lines and combined their
uncertainties with the estimates of equivalent width uncertainty.
We obtain E(B − V) = 0.22+0.08
−0.06 mag. For RV = 3.1 extinc-
tion law of Cardelli et al. (1989), this corresponds to extinction
at 550 nm of 0.68+0.25
−0.19 mag and in the Gaia G band of approxi-
mately 0.61+0.22
−0.17 mag.

3.4. Gaia DR3

CzeV343 is included in the recently released Gaia DR3 catalog,
which provides astrometry and stellar parameters based on low-
resolution BP and RP spectra and other observations and models
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022; Creevey et al. 2022). The ob-
served G-band mean magnitude is 13.54 mag and we veriﬁed
with the Gaia epoch photometry that this value is representative
of magnitudes near the maximum brightness. The inverse paral-
lax distance to CzeV343 is 4.5 ± 0.5 kpc. This estimate does not
take into account Lutz–Kelker and similar biases. After taking
these eﬀects into account, Bailer-Jones et al. (2021) provided
distances based on Gaia EDR3 parallaxes. For CzeV343 they
give 3.68+0.37
−0.26 kpc, which is noticeably closer than the inverse
parallax distance.

Since CzeV343 is composed of four eclipsing stars, the in-
terpretation of tabulated stellar parameters in Gaia DR3 is not
straightforward. As we will show in Section 4.1, the impor-
tant parameter is the eﬀective temperature of the most lumi-
nous star in the system. Gaia DR3 provides stellar parameters
determined in several ways. GSP-Phot combines BP and RP
spectra with photometry, astrometry, and stellar models. For
CzeV343, the best-ﬁt model is from A star templates, which
−44 K, [Fe/H] = −1.25+0.11
gives Teﬀ = 10793+62
−0.26, G-band extinc-
tion AG = 1.233+0.003
−0.003 mag, and distance 2.23+0.05
−0.06 kpc. GSP-
Phot using MARCS models gives Teﬀ = 7168+596
−212 K, [Fe/H] =
−0.42+0.01
−0.50 kpc. A
separate pipeline MSC models the spectra as a combination
of two components with diﬀerent temperatures and ﬂuxes. The
brighter component has Teﬀ = 7184+685
−1522 K, the system metallic-
ity is [Fe/H] = 0.11+0.27
−0.35, the extinction is AG = 0.52+0.21
−0.52 mag,
and the distance is 2.4+1.6
−1.7 kpc. The range of inferred parameters
is relatively wide and we discuss the implications in Sect. 4.1.

−0.10 mag, and distance 3.34+0.27

−0.01, AG = 0.38+0.25

As we will show in Sect. 4.4, the two binaries are on a mu-
tual orbit with semi-major axis of about 4.5 AU, which translates
to angular separation of about 1.5 mas at a distance of 3 kpc.
Although CzeV343 is not included in the catalog of non-single
stars in Gaia DR3, the astrometric solution exhibits excess noise
of 0.122 mas with a signiﬁcance of about 12. Following Hwang
et al. (2020), the expected astrometric noise for an equal-ﬂux
pair of sources exhibiting 25% photometric variability similar
to CzeV343 is about 0.37 mas, which is similar to the observed
Gaia value. It is possible that Gaia astrometry is aﬀected by pho-
tocentroid shifts caused by partially resolving the mutual orbit.

4. Properties of CzeV343

In this Section, we explore properties of CzeV343 based on our
ﬁts of light curves and spectra. We begin by discussing basic
physical parameters (Sect. 4.1) followed by the apsidal motion
in binary A (Sect. 4.3), spin state of the stars (Sect. 4.2), mu-
tual orbit (Sect. 4.4), eﬀects of nodal precession (Sect. 4.5), and
resonance of the orbital periods (Sect. 4.6).

4.1. Physical properties

We aim to derive radii and masses of all four stars in CzeV343.
Our main observables are relative radii from our photomet-
ric model: rA,1 = 0.1821 ± 0.0006, rA,2 = 0.2526 ± 0.0004,
rB,1 = 0.303 ± 0.010, and rB,2 = 0.260 ± 0.011. Notice that uncer-
tainties on radii in binary B are more than an order of magnitude
larger than in binary A. Another constraint comes from the am-
plitudes of LTTE, which directly constrain the mass ratio of the
two binaries as MA/MB = |DB/DA| = 1.252 ± 0.038. In this sec-
tion, the reported uncertainties from MCMC of our photometric
model are 1σ conﬁdence intervals. So far all of the observables
are relative quantities so we require something else to obtain ab-
solute masses and radii. There are two options: spectral types
from ours OSMOS spectrum or eﬀective temperature from Gaia
DR3.

First, we discuss our OSMOS spectrum. Our photometric
model puts the time of the exposure to the moment when binary
A was just entering the secondary eclipse and binary B was just
leaving the eclipse. This implies that the spectrum is dominated
by the ﬂux of binary A. In addition, we also found that β < 0.5,
which makes binary A the dominant component even outside of
the eclipse. Furthermore, our photometric model implies that star
2 is the brighter and larger star in binary A. Taken together, this
implies that our spectra should be dominated by star 2 in binary
A. We therefore put a constraint on the eﬀective temperature of
this star to Teﬀ,prior = 7900 ± 200 K based on empirical relation
between spectral types and eﬀective temperature of Pecaut et al.
(2012) and Pecaut & Mamajek (2013).

Second, Gaia DR3 provides two distinct values for eﬀective
temperature. One is compatible with the estimate from our OS-
MOS spectrum and the second gives much higher value of about
10800 K corresponding to late B or early A type spectrum. Since
the Gaia result is an average over many epochs, we can assume
that the value roughly corresponds to the brightest star in the
system, which is star 2 in binary A. We therefore investigate a
second possibility that Teﬀ,prior = 10800 ± 200 K.

In total, we have six constraints for eight parameters, which
implies that without additional information we cannot constrain
all radii and masses independently. If we assume that all four
components have the same age, metallicity, and have not expe-
rienced any kind of binary interaction yet, then we can use the-
oretical stellar isochrones to ﬁll in the missing information. We
use MIST isochrones (Dotter 2016; Choi et al. 2016) to calcu-
late instantaneous mass, radius, and eﬀective temperature for a
star of given initial mass, age, and metallicity. We combine our
observational constraints to a likelihood of the form

where σi are uncertainties, and the factor 1/2 in front of the ﬁrst
term gives relatively less weight on relative radii. By minimizing
ln L, we ﬁnd best-ﬁt values of the initial masses of all four com-
ponents. We choose to perform the ﬁt separately for each age
and metallicity and for two diﬀerent values of Teﬀ,prior to better
understand how our model behaves.

In Figure 5, we show the best-ﬁt masses and radii as a func-
tion of stellar age. We can very well reproduce radii in binary
A and the temperature of star 2 in binary A for both Teﬀ,prior. In
most models that we tried we ﬁnd that the isochrones predict
somewhat smaller radii in binary B, but here the observed values

ously ﬁt: mass ratio of the two binaries constrained by LTTE (top left), eﬀective temperature of star 2 in binary A (top right), and the four relative
radii of individual components from our photometric model (bottom left). In these three panels, lighter and darker bands show 1 and 2σ conﬁ-
dence intervals of the constrained parameters. In the top right diagram, we show two gray bands corresponding to two choices of Teﬀ,prior. Bottom
right panel shows the best-ﬁt initial stellar masses. In all panels, lines show best-ﬁt models as a function of isochrone age for two metallicities as
explained in the legend. The best-ﬁt model for each metallicity is marked separately for Teﬀ,prior = 7900 K (plus sign) and Teﬀ,prior = 10800 K (star).

have much higher uncertainties than in binary A. Models with
[Fe/H] = −1.00 lead to very high discrepancy in the relative ra-
dius of star 2 of binary B. Models with Teﬀ,prior = 10800 K give
better agreement with MA/MB. In Table 2, we quote the best-ﬁt
solar metallicity results for both choices of Teﬀ,prior.

Are our estimates consistent with other available informa-
tion? The ratios of total ﬂuxes of stars 1 and 2 in binaries A and
B in our photometric model are Θ(r1/r2)2 ≈ 0.343 ± 0.003 and
1.40±0.20. The ﬂux ratio between the two binaries is (1−β)/β ≈
1.22 ± 0.04. The ground-based data are taken with an instrument

sensitive between about 400 and 1000 nm, with a peak sensitiv-
ity around 600 nm. TESS has a nearly uniform sensitivity be-
tween 600 and 1000 nm. We use MIST synthetic absolute mag-
nitudes to calculate ﬂux ratios in the TESS (Bessell R) band for
the best-ﬁtting solar-metallicity model with Teﬀ,prior = 7900 K
for binaries A and B, which gives 0.29 (0.26) and 1.66 (1.72).
The ﬂux ratio of the two binaries is 2.15 (2.32). Similar num-
bers are obtained for the model with Teﬀ,prior = 10800 K. These
results suggest that our physical parameters are broadly compat-
ible with our photometric model except for the ﬂux ratio of the
two binaries.

Another comparison can be obtained from the photometric
parallax. We used the MIST isochrones to estimate the total
G-band absolute magnitude of our two best-ﬁt solar-metallicity
models. We ﬁnd that 0.52 and 1.41 mag for Teﬀ,prior = 10800
and 7900 K, respectively. Using the G-band extinction based on
equivalent width of sodium lines (Sect. 3.3), we ﬁnd distance
moduli of 12.41+0.25
−0.19 mag for the two respective
models with uncertainties dominated by the extinction. This cor-
responds to distances of 3.0+0.4
−0.2 kpc. The photometric
parallax favors the model with higher Teﬀ,prior. However, models
with [Fe/H] = −1.0 lead to distance moduli higher by a about
0.30 and 0.53 mag, respectively. Furthermore, the MIST models
underpredict stellar radii as compared to our light curve solu-
tion, which also implies that the photometric distance might be
too close.

−0.19 or 11.52+0.25

−0.3 or 2.0+0.3

Which of the models should we prefer? Although Teﬀ,prior =
10800 K gives an overall better agreement with our constraints

and with photometric parallax, this value is supported only by
one of the pipelines in Gaia DR3, while the other pipelines give
eﬀective temperatures compatible with our OSMOS spectrum.
We therefore choose the Teﬀ,prior = 7900 K and [Fe/H] = 0.00
results as our ﬁducial parameters of CzeV343 for the rest of the
paper. This choice is somewhat arbitrary, in fact, we could proba-
bly construct similarly plausible solutions for a range of Teﬀ,prior.
The uncertainty on stellar masses is best obtained by compar-
ing results for the two metallicities and for the same age, which
implies uncertainty of about 10%. However, the inferred values
are highly correlated in the sense that mass ratios are better con-
strained than the absolute values.

To summarize, our estimates suggest that binary A is com-
posed of a late A and late F stars with a total mass about 3 M(cid:12)
and binary B is composed of mid F and late F stars with a total
mass about 2.6 M(cid:12). We emphasize that precise estimates of in-
dividual properties of all four stars is not the main goal of this
paper. What is important is that likely all four stars are above
the Kraft break and have radiative envelopes. We caution that
our estimates are contingent on the eﬀective temperature of the
brightest star in the system, which we were unable to unambigu-
ously constrain. Clearly, a more robust picture would come from
performing spectral disentangling and radial velocity analysis on
new spectroscopic data, similarly to what was done for V994 Her
and other DEBs (e.g. Lee et al. 2008; Kostov et al. 2021), or
by constructing a detailed spectro-photometric model combining
light curves, spectral energy distributions, and astrometry (e.g.
Borkovits et al. 2021). Throughout the rest of the text we dis-
cuss implications of having higher stellar masses wherever it is
appropriate. Fortunately, many quantities depend on mass ratios
rather than the total mass and the mass uncertainty is often not
the fundamental limitation of our analysis.

4.2. Spins of individual stars

The spin state of individual stars in CzeV343 is of interest, be-
cause it can constrain history of tidal evolution and can poten-
tially reveal spins misaligned with orbits (e.g. Dai et al. 2018;
Liang et al. 2022). Unfortunately, all stars in CzeV343 seem to
have radiative envelopes, which makes presence of prominent
stellar spots unlikely as evidenced by the decreasing spot ampli-
tude with stellar eﬀective temperature (e.g. Reinhold et al. 2019;
Avallone et al. 2022; David et al. 2022). Indeed, we do not see
any apparent modulation inconsistent with the our DEB model.
However, we can probe low-level activity by studying resid-
uals of the DEB model. In Figure 6, we show results of Lomb–
Scargle periodogram (Astropy Collaboration et al. 2013, 2018)
performed separately on ground-based (left panel) and TESS 2-
min data (right panel). We can see that despite their long total
total time-span, ground-based data are insuﬃcient to reveal any
prominent frequencies. Highest powers are reached for periods
between 0.2 and 0.4 days, which corresponds to the typical du-
ration of nightly observing runs.

The situation is diﬀerent for TESS 2-min data, where we see
a number of harmonics associated with the orbital frequency of
binary A, fA = 1/PA. These harmonics can be either caused by
poor ﬁt due to uncorrected systematics, inadequacy of the un-
derlying binary model based on ellipsoids rather than Roche sur-
faces, or actual dynamical perturbations to the orbit due to binary
B (Eq. [2]). We did not ﬁnd any harmonics of binary B except of
the obvious resonances with binary A.

In addition to these modes, we identiﬁed a triplet of
modes surrounding fA, which does not straightforwardly match
any obvious combination of fA and fB. Instead, we ﬁnd that

these modes approximately correspond to the harmonics of the
pseudo-synchronous rotation frequency fpsrot reached by tidally
synchronized stars in an eccentric binary. According to Hut
(1981) and Eggleton (2006, p. 161), fpsrot is

In this expression, we neglect the small correction due to spin an-
gular momentum, which is on the level of 10−4 for binary A. The
peak at fpsrot has false alarm probability level smaller than 0.01,
but the other harmonics have higher false alarm probabilities.

Interestingly, the pseudo-synchronous rotation peaks in the
periodogram are slightly shifted from what Equation (9) predicts
based on eA from our photometric model. To bring the results in
agreement we would have to increase fpsrot by about 1%. There
are four possible explanations. First, Equation (9) is inaccurate,
because it is based on equilibrium tidal theory, which only ap-
proximates the real tidal ﬁeld. Second, our photometric eccen-
tricity is lower by approximately 8% than the true value, which
we consider unlikely given the timespan and quality of our data.
Third, the tidal synchronization in binary A has not completely
ﬁnished due to either young age or continuous decrease of eA
and at least one of the stars is rotating slightly faster than the
pseudo-synchronous rate. Fourth, it is possible that three consec-
utive sectors of TESS data are insuﬃcient to measure fpsrot with
this precision and the oﬀset in frequencies is purely due to low
signal to noise ratio. We consider explanations one and four, or
their combination, most likely, but in Section 5.1 we will brieﬂy
explore the implications of stars in binary A rotating faster than
the pseudosynchronous rate.

Finally, we identiﬁed a mode with a period of about
0.45 days, which is not easily matched to harmonics of any ob-
vious frequency in the system. This mode could be caused by
pulsations of one the stars. This does not aﬀect any of our sub-
sequent analysis so we do not discuss this ﬁnding anymore.

4.3. Apsidal motion

Binary A shows a clear apsidal motion with a period of 2π/ ˙ω ≈
33.4+0.2
−0.2 years (Fig. 4, Tab. 1). To understand the source of the ap-
sidal motion, we evaluate the individual contributions following,
for example, Philippov & Raﬁkov (2013) and Liang et al. (2022).
The apsidal motion is composed of general relativity ( ˙ωGR), tidal
( ˙ωtide), rotational ( ˙ωrot), and outer orbit ( ˙ωAB) components:

˙ω = ˙ωGR +

(cid:88)

l

˙ωtide,l +

(cid:88)

l

˙ωrot,lφl + ˙ωAB,

(10)

where the summation is over both stars, l = {1, 2}, and φl depends
on the spin orientation relative to the orbit. When spins and orbit
are perfectly aligned, φl = 1.

In Table 3, we present the expressions for individual contri-
butions to apsidal motion and their numerical values for individ-
ual components of binary A. To estimate the values of apsidal
motion constant, we use the tables of Claret (2004) and inves-
tigate the range of k2 for models with initial masses similar to
our ﬁducial values in Table 2 and with age between 300 Myr
and 1 Gyr. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that −2.09 ≤ log k2,1 ≤ −2.05
and −2.54 ≤ log k2,2 ≤ −2.41. We choose values approximately
in the middle of the intervals, speciﬁcally log k2,1 = −2.07 and
log k2,2 = −2.47. We see that apsidal motion is dominated by
tidal and rotational contributions, while general relativity and
perturbations from the other binary are very small. The observed

Notes. All values are given in rad/day and we assumed φl = 1 for both components. Equations come from Liang et al. (2022) and Borkovits et al.
(2015). The function F is deﬁned in Eq. (C8) of Borkovits et al. (2015) and depends on the mutual inclination of orbit A to the outer orbit. Its
value is about −0.20 for mutually perpendicular orbits (cos iA,AB = 0) compatible with constraints from Sect. 4.4.

rate is very close to the theoretical value with the assumption
that the spins are aligned with the orbit. We could get a perfect
agreement if we slightly moved the values k2 within the ranges
quoted here, for example, log k2,1 = −2.06 and log k2,2 = −2.45
give total apsidal motion rate of 5.08 × 10−4 rad/day. It is also
worth pointing out that if masses of stars in binary A were higher
(Sect. 4.1), then the theoretical apsidal precession rate could be
signiﬁcantly lower. For example, if the mass of star 1 in binary A
was 1.41 M(cid:12), tables of Claret (2004) predict log k2,1 ≈ −2.32,
which would lower the total apsidal precession rate to about
4.0 × 10−4 rad/day. This could be viewed as a support for lower
mass solution in CzeV343.

It is important to point out that the observed apsidal rate can
be substantially diﬀerent from the dynamical rate observed in
the frame of the binary, which can be precessing either due to
misaligned spins or an external perturbing object. Philippov &
Raﬁkov (2013) analyzed this scenario for DI Her, where the
spins and the orbit are misaligned. Borkovits et al. (2007) fo-
cused on triple stellar systems and found that the measured ˙ω
can be smaller than the theoretical value if only a fraction of the
apsidal cycle is covered with observations and if the outer or-

Article number, page 10 of 29

bit is oriented almost in the plane of the sky. As we will show
in Section 4.4, this is exactly the situation in CzeV343. We ﬁnd
relatively good match between the observed and theoretically-
predicted values of ˙ωA, but these complications should be kept
in mind.

Finally, eccentricity of binary B in our photometric model,
eB = 0.0017+0.0020
−0.0013, is consistent with a circular orbit, which
makes any estimates of apsidal motion impossible at this point.

4.4. Mutual orbit

As part of our photometric model we included LTTE due to the
mutual orbit of binaries A and B and thus prove that they are
bound. We ﬁnd that the measured LTTE amplitude is only DA ≈
1.75 × 10−3 days. From Equation (1) and using our values for eAB
and ωAB, we would expect amplitude 8.60+0.8
−1.3 ×10−3 sin iAB days.
This implies that sin iAB ≈ 0.205+0.026
−0.015 and that the inclination of
the mutual orbit is only about 11.8+1.5
−0.9 degrees. These estimates
include only the uncertainties on DA, PAB, eAB, and ωAB and not
on stellar masses. However, the observed LTTE amplitude is so

small that the mutual orbit must be nearly face-on for any realis-
tic stellar masses.

Based on this inference, we can estimate the range of inclina-
tions between binaries A and B and their mutual orbit, iA,AB and
iB,AB. From LTTE, we know that the angular momentum vector
of the mutual orbit is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the sky
and that the angular momentum vectors of the two inner binaries
are in the plane of the sky. Therefore, iA,AB and iB,AB must be
large. The angle iA,AB must satisfy

aligned the spins. The situation was diﬀerent in the past when the
orbit was wider and apsidal precession rate signiﬁcantly smaller.
We model this scenario by simply setting k2 to 10−4 of their orig-
inal value. We observe dramatic changes of spin-orbit angle on
the timescale of nodal precession. This eﬀect might be observ-
able in 2+2 quadruples with inner orbits wider than in CzeV343.

4.6. Period resonance

cos(iA + iAB) ≤ cos iA,AB ≤ cos(iA − iAB),

(11)

The most striking feature of CzeV343 is the close period reso-
nance. Our updated photometric model gives

where we need to keep in mind the 180◦ ambiguity of the angles.
A similar relation holds for iB,AB. We ﬁnd that 76◦ (cid:46) iA,AB (cid:46) 104◦
and either 63◦ (cid:46) iB,AB (cid:46) 86◦ or 94◦ (cid:46) iB,AB (cid:46) 117◦. We ver-
iﬁed these constraints by Monte Carlo simulation of unit vec-
tor distributed on a sphere. Our results imply that even three-
dimensional orbits are highly inclined with respect to each other.
We discuss evolutionary implications for this misalignment in
Section 5.1.

Our ﬁnding of misalignment in CzeV343 make this object
potentially unique among other DEBs. However, it is important
to point out that a randomly oriented orbit only has a small prob-
ability of lying in the plane of the sky. It is more likely that the
orbit will be signiﬁcantly inclined. Since with LTTE we cannot
constrain mutual orientation of DEB orbits when viewed edge-
on, it cannot be excluded that many DEBs actually have signif-
icantly misaligned orbits. This problem can be addressed with
larger samples of fully characterized DEBs.

4.5. Nodal precession

The large mutual inclination between inner and outer orbits will
lead to nodal precession of inner orbits. This has three conse-
quences. First, the apsidal motion will include additional term
due to nodal precession. Borkovits et al. (2015, Appendix C)
gives expression for contribution to the apsidal rate from nodal
precession. Its magnitude is similar to ˙ωAB given in Table 3 and
therefore its eﬀect will be similarly small.

Second, observed inclinations of the inner binaries will
change over time, which can be observed as changing eclipse
depths. The typical timescale for inclination change is P2
AB/PA ≈
4800 years. This is much longer than the span of observations
we might hope to achieve. However, the eclipse depth can be
very sensitive to inclination changes, for example, for grazing
eclipses. Our ﬁtting code does not straightforwardly allow for
ﬁtting of changing inclination. However, looking at the ﬁt of in-
dividual nights over 11 years of our data (Figs. B.1–B.2), we do
not see any trends in minima depths that are not captured by the
photometric model. Perhaps these changes will be detected in
the future.

Third, nodal precession can introduce non-trivial interaction
between the spins and orbits of the binaries. To investigate the
short-term spin-orbit dynamics, we implemented the equations
of Eggleton & Kiseleva-Eggleton (2001) taking into account GR
and quadrupolar distortion precession, perturbations by a distant
body, and neglecting all tidal interactions. We set up the calcula-
tion to resemble binary A, which is perturbed by a distant com-
panion with mass equal to the total mass of binary B. We see
fast apsidal motion and signiﬁcantly slower nodal precession, as
expected. We do not see any change of angle between the spin
and orbital angular momentum irrespective of whether the spin
started aligned or misaligned relative to the orbit. Since we ob-
serve synchronous rotation in A, the tides have also quite likely

3 fA − 2 fB ≈ (1.9794 ± 0.0003) × 10−3 cycles/day,

(12)

which looks signiﬁcantly far away from the resonance. However,
Tremaine (2020) showed that the 3:2 resonant condition includes
also apsidal motion and mutual orbit as

3 fA − 2 fB = faps,A − n fAB,

(13)

where faps,A = ˙ωA/(2π), and n is a small integer. It is important
to point out that this resonant condition was derived for exactly
aligned inner and outer orbits, which is dramatically diﬀerent
from the highly misaligned orbits in CzeV343. It is also possible
that the resonant mechanism is diﬀerent for misaligned orbits.
Furthermore, the apsidal rate ˙ω seen from the outer orbit is po-
tentially diﬀerent from the true rate in the frame of the inner
binary, as we discussed in Section 4.3 (Borkovits et al. 2007;
Philippov & Raﬁkov 2013). Despite these complications, it is
still instructive to evaluate Equation (13) with the observed val-
ues of the relevant quantities.

But before we do that, we need to make clear whether our
observed values and Equation (13) are in the same frame of ref-
erence. The orbital parameters can be formulated either in the
sidereal frame, where angles are measured relative to the distant
observer, or in the anomalistic frame, where angles are measured
relative to the orbital pericenter, which can be precessing in time.
As a result, the resonant conditions in these two frames should
be related by the apsidal precession frequency. Orbital periods
in Table 1 are in the sidereal frame, because we are measuring
the mean interval between eclipses. The theoretical condition is
also in the sidereal frame (Tremaine, 2022, private communica-
tion). We can therefore directly compare our observations with
the theoretical condition6.

In Figure 7, we show with orange stars the individual terms
of Equation (13) and their combinations for diﬀerent n. We see
that the best match for the period resonance is achieved for
n = −3, but there is still disagreement of about 10−4 cycles/day,
which is much larger than our formal conﬁdence interval. We
already discussed that MCMC exploration gives surprisingly
small uncertainties on the properties of the mutual orbit. If we
increased the uncertainty of PAB to 10 or 20%, the resonance
would agree with the uncertainties.

However, we found out that if we change the sign in front of

faps,A in Equation (13) as

3 fA − 2 fB = − faps,A − n fAB,

(14)

the match becomes essentially exact as we show with green stars
in Figure 7. The diﬀerence between left- and right-hand sides

6 A more thorough explanation of the structure of resonant relations in
the context of precessing orbits in the Solar system is given by Murray
& Dermott (1999, Chapter 8.2). Discussion of sidereal and anomalistic
frames of reference in the context of apsidal motion in binary stars is
given, for example, by Gimenez & Garcia-Pelayo (1983).

−1.2 × 10−5 cycles/day. It is
not clear how to interpret this ﬁnding, but it might represent a
diﬀerent resonance condition for misaligned binaries or some
kind of its projection due to geometrical eﬀects mentioned in
Section 4.3.

5. Discussions

In this section, we discuss evolution of CzeV343 focusing on
how it achieved the current resonant state (Sect. 5.1) and how it
will evolve in the future (Sect. 5.2).

5.1. Past evolution

Tremaine (2020) presented several conditions that need to be sat-
isﬁed for capturing 2+2 quadruples in the 3:2 resonance. This
theory assumes that all orbits are coplanar, which is violated in
CzeV343. Although the actual resonance mechanism for mis-
aligned orbits might be diﬀerent from coplanar orbits, it is still
interesting to discuss the coplanar resonant conditions in the con-
text of CzeV343. First, the theoretical range of mean motions
due to resonance splitting is

where (cid:15) = aA/aAB ≈ 7.2 × 10−3 is the small parameter in the
system Hamiltonian, and we set |n| = 3 as derived in Section 4.6.
From our photometric model, we ﬁnd |1 − 2PA/3PB| ≈ 7.9790 ±
0.0012 × 10−4 and CzeV343 therefore ﬁts within the resonance
width, as Tremaine (2020) also concluded.

Second, capture to coplanar resonance requires that orbital

frequencies evolve as

(16)

Since all stars in CzeV343 likely have radiative envelopes, mag-
netic braking is not eﬃcient and the binary separations should
evolve by gravitational radiation as

binary A,
binary B,

(17)

which implies that Equation (16) is not satisﬁed. Star 1 in binary
A and both stars in binary B are actually very close to the divid-
ing line between convective and radiative envelopes and mag-
netic braking could have been operating in CzeV343. However,
since binary B is closer and has lower mass, its magnetic braking
would be stronger than in A and its evolutionary timescale due to
magnetic braking would be shorter than for binary A, again not
satisfying the requirement of Equation (16).

Third, capture to coplanar resonance requires that binary A

eA (cid:46) (cid:15)5/3 ≈ 2.7 × 10−4,

(18)

which is not satisﬁed by a large margin. Tremaine (2020) pro-
posed that eccentricity in DEBs can be excited after the resonant
capture. For CzeV343, the obvious candidate are von Zeipel–
Lidov–Kozai (vZLK) cycles, because we showed that the orbits

(19)

This timescale is about an order of magnitude longer than the
apsidal precession period in binary A, which is primarily set by
tidal and rotation contributions (Sect. 4.3). This makes vZLK in-
operable in the current conﬁguration of CzeV343 (e.g. Fabrycky
& Tremaine 2007). vZLK cycles could have operated earlier in
the evolution CzeV343 when the orbits were wider and apsidal
precession was less important.

What is the origin of eccentricity in binary A? Justesen & Al-
brecht (2021) calculated theoretical circularization orbital peri-
ods for binaries of various eﬀective temperature based on models
of Claret (2004). For binaries with eﬀective temperatures simi-
lar to CzeV343, the critical circularization orbital period is 1–
2 days. Since the circularization is a strong function of stellar
radii relative to orbital size and (r1 + r2)B > (r1 + r2)A, it is
highly likely that binary B has already circularized while binary
A is still undergoing its circularization process. This implies that
the circularization timescale tcirc of binary A is about the age of
system, which is a few hundred Myr. However, Justesen & Al-
brecht (2021) identiﬁed many hot binaries with longer periods
and circular orbits, which suggests that tides can be, at least in
some situations, signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient than what dynami-
cal theory predicts. It is thus not impossible that tcirc in binary A
is signiﬁcantly shorter than the age of the system.

In Section 4.2, we detected a signal very close to the pseudo-
synchronous rotation frequency of binary A. It is interesting to
discuss what does this imply for the origin of the eccentricity.
Synchronization timescale tsync is shorter than the circularization
timescale by the ratio of spin to orbital angular momentum λ,
tsync = λtcirc (Eggleton 2006). For star 2 in binary A, λ is

λ = r2

gyrr2

MA
M1,A

frot
fA

≈ 5 × 10−3,

(20)

where rgyr ≈ 0.2 is the relative gyration radius based on models
of Claret (2004), and r2 is the relative radius from photometry
(Tab. 1). Pseudo-synchronous rotation in binary A implies that
the eccentricity was excited more than about tsync ago, which is
about few Myr if tcirc is approximately the age of the system. This
is much longer than tvZLK, but consistent with the fact vZLK are
currently not operating in CzeV343.

The frequency in photometric residuals appears to be about
1% faster than the pseudo-synchronous rotation frequency.
There remains doubt whether this excess is real, but taken at face
value, does this excess imply that synchronization in binary A is
still ongoing? To study this question, we have implemented a
simple equilibrium tidal model for the evolution of orbital and
stellar rotation frequencies and the eccentricity from Eggleton
(2006, Chap. 4.2). We manually select initial values of λ so that
the asymptotic values are similar to what we estimated for bi-
nary A assuming that the absolute stellar radius is constant and
λ ∝ f 4/3. In Figure 8, we show several examples of the evolu-
tion. In all cases, the rotation frequency excess frot/ fpsrot − 1 con-
verges to a small positive value, which is noticeably smaller than
1%. The frequency excess exceeds 1% only during the fast ini-
tial synchronization period, but we would have to be extremely
lucky to catch CzeV343 shortly after its eA was excited. Sub-
stantial eccentricity seems to be common in many DEBs, which
argues against lucky eccentricity excitation.

To summarize our discussion, although CzeV343 is located
nearly exactly on the 3:2 period resonance, many of its properties
are not consistent with the theoretical requirements for resonant
capture for coplanar orbits. This is not too surprising, because
we showed that orbits in CzeV343 are highly misaligned. We
think that the most plausible scenario is that at or shortly after its
birth, CzeV343 reached a state, where binary A had substantial
eccentricity but binary B was already close to its current con-
ﬁguration. Eccentricity in binary A could have been excited by
vZLK oscillations at times when A was wider and the intrinsic
apsidal precession was unimportant. The subsequent tidal evo-
lution synchronized the rotation and nearly circularized the or-
bit while decreasing the semi-major axis. This scenario satisﬁes
the condition in Equation (16), but violates the requirement of
small eccentricity (Eq. [18]) and that the eccentricity damping
timescale must be much shorter than the semi-major axis evolu-
tion timescale (Tremaine 2020). Clearly, resonance capture the-
ory that takes into account misaligned orbits and vZLK cycles
would be very useful for explaining CzeV343.

5.2. Future evolution

We are interested to learn about the future evolution of CzeV343.
Leaving aside the unknown consequences of period resonance,
we could use the code MSE, which combines secular and dy-
namical evolution of multiple stellar systems with stellar evo-
lution (Hamers et al. 2021b). Similar study was performed, for
example, by Merle et al. (2022). However, the ratio of orbital
periods between the inner and outer orbits in CzeV343 is so
large that individual model runs in MSE would take many tens of
hours. We would need many such runs, because we cannot fully
constrain the mutual geometry of the orbits. Instead, we focus
on the evolution of individual binaries and discuss the inﬂuence
of their mutual orbit only qualitatively. We use the binary popu-
lation code COMPAS (Riley et al. 2022) to synthesize a number
of possible realizations of binaries of binaries A and B. We use
the default parameters for binary evolution.

Given the uncertainties in stellar parameters of CzeV343 and
in the theoretical models, we explore a range of initial param-
eters. For binary A, our grid covers 1.6 ≤ MA,2 ≤ 1.9 M(cid:12),
1.0 ≤ PA ≤ 1.4 days, 0.5 ≤ qA ≤ 0.9, and 0 ≤ eA ≤ 0.15. We ﬁnd
that only about 20% of such binaries survive, mostly as binary
He and C/O white dwarfs. The remaining binaries merge either
on the main sequence or when one star is a He white dwarf and
the other is on the helium Hertzsprung gap. We ﬁnd that (cid:38) 85%
of simulated binaries experience signiﬁcant orbital expansion,
when the initially more massive star evolves to very low masses
by mass transfer to its companion. The maximum semi-major
axis achieved in the evolution ranges from 50 to 220 R(cid:12). In such
situations, the entire quadruple system could become dynami-
cally unstable. This would be very similar to the triple evolu-
tion dynamical instability (TEDI) triggered by orbital expansion
driven by mass transfer (Perets & Kratter 2012; Hamers et al.
2022b). We do not have stability criteria for quadruples, but we
can approximate the system as a triple by replacing the other bi-
nary with a point mass with the same total mass. In such case,
we can use the stability criterion of Mardling & Aarseth (2001)

Fig. 8. Several examples of possible tidal evolution of binary A in CzeV343. In the top left panel, we show orbital (solid lines) and stellar rotation
(dashed lines) frequencies for diﬀerent initial parameters indicated in the legend. In the top right panel, we show the ratio between rotation and
pseudo-synchronous frequencies including a zoom-in on the early part of the evolution. The vertical dashed line shows the 1% excess possibly
detected in CzeV343. In bottom left panel, we show the evolution of λ that converges near the current estimate of 0.005 marked with horizontal
dashed line. In bottom right panel, we display the evolution of eccentricity with the value 0.1 marked with a horizontal dashed line. Time is
measured in the units of the tidal friction timescale, which is approximately 9tcirc (Eggleton 2006).

realizations of binary A that survive main sequence as a binary
will experience this dynamical instability.

For binary B, we run models with 1.2 ≤ MB,1 ≤ 1.5 M(cid:12),
0.75 ≤ qB ≤ 1.0, 0.6 ≤ PB ≤ 1.0 days, and eB = 0. We
ﬁnd that apart from several runs that produce double He white
dwarfs, vast majority of the simulations lead to mergers either of
main sequence stars or helium stars. Similarly to binary A, about
60% of realizations experience orbital expansion to between
80 and 150 R(cid:12). Applying the stability condition of Mardling &
Aarseth (2001), we ﬁnd that the binary B is stable also only for
aB (cid:46) 50 R(cid:12) and again a large fraction of realizations will end up
dynamically unstable.

Finally, we explore what happens when either or both of the
binaries merge already on the main sequence. To estimate the
range of possible outcomes, we neglect any changes in the struc-
ture and mass of the merger remnants7 and approximate the sys-
tem as a binary with primary mass 2.7 ≤ MA ≤ 3.3 M(cid:12), mass
ratio 0.7 ≤ qAB ≤ 1.0, orbital period 1300 ≤ PAB ≤ 1500 days,
and eccentricity 0.6 ≤ eAB ≤ 0.8. We ﬁnd that about 85% of
realizations evolve to C/O binary white dwarfs. About 10% end
as Type Ia supernova explosion and the rest are either main se-
quence mergers or double white dwarf binaries composed of He
and C/O white dwarfs. We note that if the masses in CzeV343
are actually higher than what is assumed here (Tab. 2), the out-
comes associated with more massive stars such as Type Ia su-
pernovae would become more likely. Since binary A is more
massive than binary B, it would merge ﬁrst and the remnant can
evolve to red giant while binary B is still near the main sequence.
In this case, some of these evolutionary pathways would actu-
ally include mass transfer from the merged product of binary A
to binary B. This mass transfer can either remain stable or it can
culminate in triple common envelope evolution (Glanz & Perets
2021; Hamers et al. 2022a; Merle et al. 2022).

7 Analysis of recent mergers from low-mass stars suggests that only
about 10% of the binary mass is lost during the interaction (e.g. Nandez
et al. 2014; Pejcha et al. 2017; MacLeod et al. 2017).

In Sect. 4.1, we could not unambigously establish the tem-
peratures and masses of the stars. It remains possible that the
individual components are more massive than our ﬁducial as-
sumption. We expect that fractional probabilities of the indi-
vidual evolutionary pathways would change. In particular, we
expect to have a higher frequency of binaries ending as Type
Ia supernovae. However, the total mass of the quadruple is still
smaller than 8 M(cid:12) and it is unlikely that the evolution would end
with a formation of a neutron star or a black hole.

6. Conclusions

We have analyzed long-term ground-based optical photometry
together with TESS 2-minute photometry and two optical spec-
tra of CzeV343. Our results can be summarized as follows.

– We construct a photometric model for the two eclipsing bi-
naries on a mutual orbit manifested by LTTE (Sect. 3.2). We
also include possibility of an additional light in the system
and we take into account instrumental signals simultaneously
with the physical model. We explore the parameter space
with MCMC and we constrain all of the model parameters
(Table 1, Fig. 1, Appendices B, C, D).

– By combining relative radii from photometry, relative am-
plitudes of LTTE, spectral type based on one of our optical
spectra, and theoretical single-star isochrones, we constrain
physical properties of all four stars in CzeV343 (Sect. 4.1).
We ﬁnd that binary A is composed of stars of approximately
1.76 and 1.27 M(cid:12) and binary B has stars of mass of approx-
imately 1.36 and 1.20 M(cid:12) (Tab. 2). The age of the system
is a few hundred Myr (Fig. 5). The uncertainties on our re-
sults are considerable and complex. Radial velocity study of
CzeV343 would be beneﬁcial, but would be diﬃcult due to
wide absorption lines in spectrum.

– We perform period analysis on the residuals of our photo-
metric model and identify a signal consistent with pseudo-
synchronous rotation in binary A (Sect. 4.2). The rota-
tion signal is possibly about 1% faster than the pseudo-

synchronous rate, but the duration of the TESS 2-min data
is too short to determine this more exactly (Fig. 6). Analysis
of stellar rotation in DEBs is an unexplored territory, which
could give new clues to their formation.

– We see a clear apsidal motion in binary A with a period of
33.4 ± 0.2 years (Sect. 4.3). We calculate contributions to the
apsidal precession rate from general relativity, tidal defor-
mation, and rotation, and ﬁnd that the observed rate can be
fully explained assuming the stellar spins are aligned with
the orbit (Tab. 3). Interpretation of observed apsidal motion
is potentially complicated by orbital precession induced by
binary B. Eccentricity of binary B is consistent with zero.
– Our photometric model gives for the orbital period of the mu-
tual orbit of the two binaries as PAB ≈ 1454+10.2
−8.3 days and its
eccentricity as eAB ≈ 0.70+0.09
−0.07, which proves that the two bi-
naries are gravitationally bound (Sect. 4.4). The amplitudes
of the LTTE of both binaries are signiﬁcantly smaller than
what would be expected based on their masses, which sug-
gests that the outer orbit has a low observed inclination of
about 11◦. By randomly sampling possible orientations of
the individual orbits, we ﬁnd that the inner and outer orbits
are signiﬁcantly misaligned and potentially even retrograde.
The constraints on the relative inclinations of the A and B
orbits and the outer orbit are 76◦ (cid:46) iA,AB (cid:46) 104◦ and either
63◦ (cid:46) iB,AB (cid:46) 86◦ or 94◦ (cid:46) iB,AB (cid:46) 117◦.

– We quantify the 3:2 period resonance of the two inner or-
bits (Sect. 4.6). We ﬁnd that if we signiﬁcantly increase the
uncertainty in PAB to about 10%, we can match the theo-
retical combination of orbital and apsidal frequencies de-
rived by Tremaine (2020) (Eq. [13]). However, if we change
the sign of the apsidal motion (Eq. [14]), the resonance be-
comes nearly exact with our frequency uncertainty of 10−5
cycles/day (Fig. 7).

– We ﬁnd that the properties of CzeV343 are not compatible
with many requirements of the resonance capture theory de-
veloped by Tremaine (2020) for coplanar orbits (Sect. 5.1).
This is not too surprising given the high misalignment of
inner and outer orbits. The current eccentricity of binary
A, eA ≈ 0.11, and synchronous rotation of at least one of
its stars disfavor recent eccentricity excitation. Instead, we
propose that binary A is tidally circularizing from a past
high-eccentricity state, which could have been caused by von
Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai oscillations. Theory of resonant capture
should be modiﬁed to take into account misaligned and ec-
centric orbits.

– We explore future evolutionary pathways of binaries A and B
using binary population synthesis code COMPAS (Sect. 5.2).
We ﬁnd that either binary typically merges on the main se-
quence or evolves to a double white dwarf binary. During
mass transfer episodes, the mass ratio can become so ex-
treme that the associated orbital expansion will trigger dy-
namical instability similarly to what was identiﬁed by Perets
& Kratter (2012) and Hamers et al. (2022b) for triples. How-
ever, detailed properties of this instability remain unknown
in the case of 2+2 quadruples. If both binaries merge on the
main sequence, the total mass of the system is suﬃciently
high and the mutual orbit is suﬃciently compact to open the
possibility of evolution leading to a Type Ia supernova.

– In Appendix A, we describe algorithms and functionality of
computer programs SIPS and SILICUPS, which can help to
eﬃciently organize and analyze extended time series pho-
tometry of variable stars and similar objects.

Pejcha et al.: The complex past and future of CzeV343

Appendix A: Description of SIPS & SILICUPS

Astronomical instrumentation commercially available to citizen
scientists is quickly advancing. The trend is especially prominent
with imaging detectors, where improvements in size and sensi-
tivity enable new projects. Speciﬁcally, taking measurements of
a single star in an entire image is being replaced by projects that
analyze light curves of all stars in the image with the hope of
discovering new variables or unexpected features in the already
known ones. The mode of operation of many citizen skywatchers
begins to resemble professional time-domain surveys. But there
is an important diﬀerence: while professional surveys take one or
at most few points every night, citizen scientist can easily take
few hundred images of the same ﬁeld every night.

These advances bring new challenges related to data pro-
cessing, where manual operations with a single time series are
simply not feasible anymore. For example, ground-based data of
CzeV343 were taken with a 16 Mpx camera with a 1.5 × 1.5 deg2
ﬁeld of view. About 34 000 stars were regularly detected on each
image and about 200 objects are regularly monitored with O − C
diagrams, phased light curves, and other tools. In denser Milky
Way ﬁelds, the number of stars can exceed 100 000 with cor-
respondingly higher number of interesting objects. Clearly, this
data volume and complexity requires appropriate tools that can
be eﬃciently used by citizen scientists with little to no scripting
experience and time to develop their own pipelines. Here, we
give a brief description of two software packages for Windows
operating system8, which eﬃciently utilize multi-core architec-
ture of current processors and are controlled by graphical user
interface.

Appendix A.1: SIPS (Simple Image Processing System)

SIPS functions cover two main areas. First, SIPS controls the
imaging device and other observatory equipment (telescope
mounts, ﬁlter wheels, focusers, observatory domes, and others),
and second, SIPS performs image calibration and astrometric
and photometric reduction. Photometry processing consists of
several steps that are described in more detail below: detection
of stars, image alignment and astrometry, aperture photometry,
processing of the results, and identiﬁcation of variable objects.

Appendix A.1.1: Detecting stars

An algorithm for detection of stars was developed from scratch
speciﬁcally for SIPS. The performance of the algorithm is con-
trolled by four user-deﬁned parameters:

– Aperture deﬁning a box size, where the mean and standard
deviation of pixel values are calculated. This box is moved
through the image.

– Threshold above which a pixel is tested if it is a part of a stel-
lar image. Threshold is speciﬁed in the number of standard
deviations above the mean.

– A minimal number of neighboring pixels that must also sat-
isfy the above-deﬁned threshold. Neighboring pixels are 4
pixels adjacent in the x and y axes directions plus the 4 cor-
ner pixels. Up to 8 pixels are tested to lie above the calculated
threshold.

– Number of iterations to reﬁne the stellar mask.

8 Both programs are freely available at https://www.gxccd.com/
cat?id=146&lang=409

A pixel is considered to be part of a star image only if its
value lies above the speciﬁed threshold and the minimal deﬁned
number of adjacent pixels also pass the same condition. How-
ever, a group of such adjacent pixels is considered as a star only
if no pixel of the group touches the border of the current box.
This eliminates multiple detections of the same group at diﬀerent
box positions. Such a group will be detected as a star when the
box is positioned within the image to contain all pixels fulﬁlling
the criteria deﬁned above. Additionally, a single bit-depth mask
of the same size as the examined image (bitmask) is created for
every image, where the bits correspond to pixels belonging to the
stellar image. When the aperture box moves through the image,
pixels already set in the bitmask are skipped.

Centroids (averaged positions weighted by pixel value above
the background) of the continuous groups of pixels are used as
the ﬁrst estimate of stellar positions. Such positions can be af-
fected by diﬀerences in the aperture box mean and standard de-
viation values if another star or its part lies within the box and
if such star is not yet detected (its pixels are not ﬂagged in the
bitmask) during the ﬁrst pass through the image. To avoid this,
the algorithm performs a user-deﬁned number of passes through
the image to iteratively reﬁne star positions.

The existing bitmask is used to eliminate pixels of already
detected nearby stars within the aperture box. Eliminating star
pixels leads to a more precise calculation of the box mean and
standard deviation and therefore centroids of newly found stars
have better precision. Furthermore, the bitmask is updated after
each iteration. An irregular group of neighboring pixels repre-
senting each star detected during the previous pass is replaced
by circles with centers on newly determined centroids and with
radii determined from aperture statistics.

The algorithm used to determine radii of stars scans the pro-
ﬁle from the centroid in the four directions (up, down, left, and
right) and measures the distance from the centroid to the ﬁrst
pixel lying below the user-deﬁned threshold. Typically, values
from 1 to 2σ are used, but the optimal value depends on the stel-
lar proﬁle, which can be aﬀected by many factors such as quality
and type of optics, focusing precision, tracking precision, seeing,
etc. Typically, two iterations of bitmask reﬁnements are enough,
but the number of iterations is also a user-deﬁned parameter.

It might happen that automatically determined radii of
nearby stars overlap. This is not desirable especially when au-
tomatic apertures are used to calculate the ﬂuxes. SIPS detects
and eliminates overlapping radii and calculates new radii as the
fraction of the Euclidean distance of star centroids correspond-
ing to the ratio of the ﬂuxes of the two stars.

This method of detecting stars requires an aperture big
enough to contain even the brightest stars within the image. An
aperture too small leads to omissions of bright stars. Conversely,
an aperture too large can miss faint stars very close to bright
ones, because the statistics of the aperture box are aﬀected by
the bright star so much that the pixels of a nearby faint star re-
main under the threshold. The solution to this problem is an op-
tional usage of two apertures. User can choose a small aperture,
which ensures reliable ﬁnding of even the faintest stars in the im-
age, even if they are close to bright stars. Subsequently, a second
much bigger aperture is used to detect the brightest stars within
the image. Usage of two apertures is, of course, slower and it
is recommended mainly for dense stellar ﬁelds (typically within
the Milky Way).

Alignment calculation is based on searching for similar trian-
gles among individual images. Triangles are created from the
user-deﬁned number N of the brightest stars, so
triangles are
used. The similarity of triangles is determined by two numbers
representing the ratios of the longest triangle side to the other
two sides. The similarity limit is a user-deﬁned parameter. When
similar triangles are found, a preliminary 2D transformation 2×3
matrix, representing rotation, translation, and scaling, is created
using the least-squares method. The validity of such transforma-
tion is then tested on the brightest stars used to create triangles:
if at least 50% of stars can be matched, the transformation is
accepted. To further reﬁne the transformation, the least-squares
method is applied on all matched stars to determine the ﬁnal
transformation matrix. Transformation matrices relative to the
selected reference frame are then calculated for all images in the
set.

Appendix A.1.3: Astrometry

Absolute astrometric solution for all images is optional in SIPS,
however, many advanced SIPS functions rely on astrometry.
SIPS currently supports four star catalogs (UCAC4, UCAC5,
USNO-A2.0, and USNO-B1.0), but support for new catalogs is
added as they become available. Catalog ﬁles must be stored oﬀ-
line in the computer. Astrometric match is performed similarly
to the mutual image alignment except that one set of triangles is
artiﬁcially created from tangentially projected star coordinates
from the catalog ﬁles. Users can deﬁne the number of brightest
stars used to create triangles for each image and catalog plate.
If a matching triangle is found, a transformation matrix is cal-
culated, and tested on all stars used to create triangles. If 50%
or more stars are matched, another transformation matrix is cal-
culated from all matched stars. For astrometry purposes, every
detected star in the image is searched in the catalog and if the
corresponding catalog star is found, the pair is recorded. Then a
ﬁnal transformation matrix is calculated from all matched stars.

Appendix A.1.4: Field curvature

Wide ﬁeld optical systems often suﬀer from less than ideal tan-
gential projection of stars to the imaging area of the detector.
Depending on the ﬁeld of view, diﬀerences between ideal tan-
gential projection and the actual centroid of the projected star
can be tens of arcseconds. In such case, matching the catalog
to stars in the image is not possible. To overcome this problem,
SIPS allows for the deﬁnition of ﬁeld curvature. The correction
is based on two two-dimensional 3rd-order polynomials describ-
ing the diﬀerence between actual and ideal tangential projections
in the x and y directions. SIPS can also calculate these polyno-
mials from matched pairs of image and catalog stars using the
least-square method (2D 3rd-order polynomial regression). To
solve the challenge of providing an approximate initial solution,
SIPS contains a tool allowing the user to manually mark image-
catalog star pairs, which is then used to calculate ﬁeld curvature
description. With the correction solved, the polynomial coeﬃ-
cients can be saved into a ﬁle and later automatically re-used for
astrometric solution.

Aperture photometry is calculated for 10 apertures. Default aper-
ture radii ra range from 2 to approx. 14 pixels, which should ﬁt
virtually all combinations of detectors and optics used by am-
ateur astronomers. Still, users are free to deﬁne own apertures.
In addition to 10 predeﬁned apertures, SIPS calculates photome-
try also for aperture radius automatically determined during the
process of reﬁning of bitmap of stellar images as is described
above. To be usable for photometry measurement, aperture radii
of every star must be the same for all images in the set. There
is also the lower limit for the automatic aperture in the case the
calculation results in too small value. The smallest auto aperture
default value is set to two pixels, but this parameter is also ad-
justable by the user. To ﬁnd the automatic aperture for a set of
images, SIPS sorts the images according to the radius of the au-
tomatically determined aperture for every star. Then it chooses
the third largest aperture. This empirical rule is intended to select
the largest aperture to cover the whole star when, for example,
seeing changes during an observation session. At the same time,
the algorithm removes up to two extreme values caused, for ex-
ample, by tracking glitches or similar random events.

Mean value Fb and standard deviation σb of the background
ﬂux are calculated from pixels in a ring characterized by two
user-speciﬁed radii. The inner ring radius is always larger than
the biggest aperture used to calculate photometry. SIPS supports
two methods of background mean and standard deviation calcu-
lation. The ﬁrst method relies on the previously calculated bit-
mask, which allows skipping pixels belonging to stars. Back-
ground statistics are then calculated only from pixels between
the two radii, which are also not ﬂagged in the corresponding
bitmask. To eliminate random and mostly single-pixel artifacts
not detected as stars, all pixels above or below the mean plus or
minus 3-times the standard deviation are rejected as outliers. The
newly calculated mean and standard deviation are then taken as
valid values for background. While this method is fast and reli-
able for sparse star ﬁelds, it is not robust enough for dense ﬁelds
with many stars within the background ring or when artifacts
(e.g., diﬀraction spike from a nearby bright star, sub-atomic par-
ticle, or satellite trace) signiﬁcantly aﬀect the background ring.
As a second option, SIPS implements also a slower but more
robust mean calculation using the Hampel inﬂuence function
(Hampel et al. 2005).

Flux for photometric aperture Fa with radius ra is calculated
as a sum of pixel values above the mean level of the background
ring as

Fa =

(A.1)

where the sum proceeds over all pixels at least partially con-
tained within the aperture, ADUi is the ﬂux (Analog-to-Digital
Unit) of the pixel at coordinates (px, py), fi is the fraction of
the pixel contained in the aperture, and Na = (cid:80)
i fi is the to-
tal number of pixels in the aperture. The fraction of a pixel
contained within the aperture is calculated from the Euclidean
distance r of the star pixel from the star centroid at (cx, cy),
r2 = (px − cx)2 + (py − cy)2, as

tory; more comparison stars and check stars are optional.

SIPS graphical user interface allows immediate plotting of
light curves of variable stars deﬁned in the ﬁeld description as
well as storing photometry protocol (text ﬁle), optionally accom-
panied by an image, created from the selected frame with marked
variable, comparison, and check stars and plotted used apertures.
This facilitates quick visualization of the large number of light
curves.

Finally, SIPS requires all pixels within the photometric aper-
ture to lie below the saturation value. If any pixel exceeds satura-
tion, then the whole photometric point is invalidated, because it
is not possible to determine the amount of lost ﬂux. The sat-
uration value is by default set to (216 − 1) = 65535, which
is valid for cameras with 16-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter
(ADC). However, many modern CMOS cameras are equipped
with only 12-bit or 14-bit ADC. In such situations, SIPS relies
on a FITS header keyword DATAMAX, which provides the sat-
uration value.

Appendix A.1.6: User interface for photometry processing

Full description of the SIPS photometry package user interface
is beyond the scope of this Appendix. In general, SIPS strives
to enhance the eﬃciency of photometry processing and reduce
user eﬀort to process many wide-ﬁeld images containing tens
or hundreds of objects of interest and to save the resulting light
curves quickly for further processing.

Here, we mention in more detail two features. First, the pho-
tometry task tool plans the complete processing of the observing
series. When a task for a particular series is deﬁned, photome-
try processing can be performed by a single mouse click. Task
describes which ﬁles from which folder should be processed,
which calibration ﬁles should be used, and which ﬁeld descrip-
tion is to be loaded after processing is complete. The photometry
task can rely on SIPS default parameters for star search, align-
ment, astrometry, and photometry reduction, but it is also possi-
ble to override default values with task-speciﬁc ones, including
ﬁeld curvature description ﬁle and many other options.

Second, SIPS provides the ﬁeld description tool to easily
mark all the stars of interest (variable and comparison stars)
within the ﬁeld of view. The ﬁeld description ﬁle consists of two
parts. The ﬁrst part is a list of all named stars within a ﬁeld of
view. Names are user-deﬁned identiﬁers of variable stars, com-
parison, and possibly check stars. If the named star is paired with

SIPS can identify stars, which signiﬁcantly change their instru-
mental magnitude during the observing run. This feature can be
used to search for new variable stars or exoplanetary transits.
Variable star candidates can be identiﬁed using three methods:
1. The simplest method calculates standard deviation of instru-
mental magnitudes of each star over all images in a series.
SIPS then plots mean instrumental magnitude against the
standard deviation, which gives the typical “hockey stick”
shaped group of points. Variable stars with higher standard
deviation than non-variable stars of similar brightness are lo-
cated above the main locus of points. User can easily manu-
ally investigate light curve of any star.

2. SIPS also implements a method inspired by Eq. (3) of
Figuera Jaimes et al. (2013), which is based on previous
work of Tamuz et al. (2006) and Arellano Ferro et al. (2012).
This method helps to reduce ineﬃciency of method 1 in
ﬁelds with high number of stars and correspondingly also
with a high number of falsely positive candidates.

3. Finally, SIPS uses a simple three-layer neural network with
sigmoid transfer function. Each light curve is equidistantly
resampled to 512 points using linear interpolation and the
amplitude is normalized to range from 0 to 1. The result is
then supplied to the network input layer consisting of 512
neurons. The middle layer contains 256 neurons and the out-
put layer consists of single neuron, which gives the ﬁnal
probability that the light curve corresponds to a variable star.
The network is trained on a set of approximately 5000 ex-
amples of both variable and non-variable stars and the net-
work conﬁguration is included in the SIPS package. Vari-
able stars in the training set cover the majority of common
types, including detached, semi-detached and contact eclips-
ing binaries and pulsating stars of various types. Users are
free to create their own training sets and re-train the net-
work to better recognize the typical light curve shapes result-
ing from sampling cadence, angular resolution, image qual-
ity etc. Performance of the neural network detection of vari-
able stars depends on the numerous factors such as relative
percentage of artifacts and overall quality of data. However,
for data sets similar to the ones used to train the network,
the results are typically superior to the methods 1 or 2. Ow-
ing to the fact that the input light curve amplitudes are nor-
malized, the neural network response depends virtually on
the light curve shape only. Compared to ﬁrst two methods,
which rely on statistical properties of the series of brightness
measurements, the neural network response is not aﬀected
by absolute transit depth or the ratio between transit depth
and brightness deviation. This makes the neural network es-
pecially sensitive to variable stars with shallow transits.

Finally, we point out that functions of SIPS and SILICUPS
are continuously evolving also in response to user requests. For
example, we are now experimenting with online data synchro-
nization of data between diﬀerent users to enable eﬃcient col-
laboration.

Appendix B: Ground-based light curves

In Table B.1, we present our ground-based photometry of
CzeV343. Our dataset includes the measurements already pub-
lished by Cagaš & Pejcha (2012), but the data diﬀer in detail
due to changes in image processing and we thus reproduce them
here. Light curves from individual observing nights along with
the best-ﬁt model are shown in Figures B.1 and B.2.

Appendix C: TESS light curves

We show TESS 2-minute light curves along with their ﬁts in Fig-
ures C.1 and C.2. In Figure C.3, we show the same for TESS FFI
data with best-ﬁt PCA vectors already subtracted.

Appendix D: Posterior distributions of parameters

Figures D.1, D.2, D.3, and D.4 show posterior distributions of
the parameters of our model. The ﬁgures were made with pack-
age corner (Foreman-Mackey 2016).

SILICUPS software package is designed to gain an overview
of observed data and maintain light curves of many objects ac-
quired through many nights in one place. Here, we focus only
on the description of SILICUPS functions relevant to this work,
speciﬁcally, phenomenological ﬁtting of minima timings and en-
tire light curves, which were used to disentangle signals from
doubly eclipsing binaries and build O −C diagram shown in Fig-
ure 4.

SILICUPS works with ﬁelds, consisting of multiple objects.
Every ﬁeld is stored as a separate description ﬁle and SILICUPS
handles one ﬁeld at a time. It is upon the user if the ﬁle contains
only objects from one ﬁeld of view of the used camera/telescope
or objects spread over a large portion of the sky. However, some
advanced functions, like checking the presence of the ﬁeld ob-
jects in the AAVSO VSX database, work properly only on ﬁelds
with angularly nearby objects.

Every object within a ﬁeld has an associated individual series
of photometric points. Series are read from photometric report
text ﬁles, which include at minimum JD, magnitude or ﬂux, and
error (uncertainty). Such ﬁles are generated for instance by SIPS
or other photometry software or they can be created from pub-
licly available photometric databases (for instance from TESS
data). Any line of the photometric protocol ﬁle, which does not
start with a number, is considered a comment line. Comment
lines may contain keywords followed by values, which deﬁne
metadata (star identiﬁcation, coordinates, catalog cross-id, used
ﬁlter or time standard – heliocentric or geocentric, etc.).

To avoid manual entry of each report ﬁle, which could be
very time-consuming especially when single observing session
easily produces more than 100 new reports, SILICUPS relies
on a deﬁnition of rules to ﬁnd all relevant protocol ﬁles in the
computer ﬁle system. Such rules consist of one or more proto-
col ﬁle names, possibly containing wild-card characters, folder
name keywords, and others. SILICUPS is then able to automati-
cally update its light-curve database without user intervention.

SILICUPS contains two methods of determining variable
star periods. The ﬁrst method relies on known minima timings
and uses a brute-force algorithm to ﬁnd periods for which min-
ima instances align with deﬁned precision. This method is suit-
able especially for eclipsing binaries, where at last three minima
instances are known. The second method is based on frequency
analysis (Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1996) and is suitable especially
for physical pulsating stars.

Minima timings within individual series can be deter-
mined by ﬁtting with the phenomenological model deﬁned by
Mikulášek (2015), which can be optionally extended with a trend
(slope) to represent instrumental eﬀects. SILICUPS can ﬁt en-
tire phased light curves using a combination of functions from
Mikulášek (2015) and a second-order trigonometric polynomial
to represent out of eclipse variations. The ﬁts are performed us-
ing least squares implemented in cmpfit (Moré 1978; Mark-
wardt 2009). Uncertainties are estimated using a bootstrapping
algorithm. Any parameter can be ﬁxed to a predeﬁned value us-
ing a graphical interface.

When the phenomenological model is deﬁned for the object,
SILICUPS allows exporting of the time series with the model
subtracted from the original data. This feature allows to disen-
tangle light curves containing signals from multiple eclipsing bi-
naries and create light curves of individual components. O − C
analysis of separated components then allows studying of LTTE
and other eﬀects.
