Executive summary

Society’s engine for a responsible and sustainable future? Computer Systems! Our modern
society and competitive economy depend on a strong digital foundation and, in turn, on sustained
computer systems research and innovation. Computer systems, ranging from small, embedded
devices to large data centers and the networks that connect them, are a remarkable technology area
with an outstanding impact on society. This manifesto focuses on the Netherlands, where data centers
and related ICT infrastructure enable over 3.3 million jobs and over 60% of the GDP, and novel
services and products, and where every €1 invested in such systems generates €15 in added value.
Sustained investments in capable networking infrastructure have made the Netherlands home to one
of the largest data hubs in the world. Cloud adoption exceeds 90% for economic organizations, and
65% for government and public education organizations. Our overarching goal with this document is
to highlight the grand societal, technological, and scientific opportunities and challenges in future
computer systems and networking (the CompSys area), and to outline how to maintain the leading
position the Netherlands has in this area.

Future-proof digitalization requires ICT research and development (R&D), now. The Dutch
Government and societal stakeholders have identified an urgent need to expand economic and social
activities by leveraging and integrating ICT in their knowledge, processes, expertise, and capabilities.
This approach, of profound digitalization, can make current activities much more valuable, enable new
development that can transform society, and lead to unprecedented efficiency and thus universal
access to ICT for the first time in history. Without action, the Netherlands could lose its leadership role
in the CompSys area, ICT services may lose their flexible, trusted, and secure status in the digital
economy, ICT researchers in the Netherlands could be brain-drained to other countries, and the
existing shortage of ICT-skilled people could grow. We are not alone: our main allies and competitors
in Europe,
including Germany and France, and in the world, including the US and China, are
intensifying their strategic long-term R&D investments in ICT, with strong emphasis on systems and
networking infrastructure. In Europe, understanding is growing that ICT must uphold European values.

With this manifesto, we draw attention to CompSys as a vital part of ICT. Among ICT
technologies, CompSys covers all the hardware and all the operational software layers that enable
applications; only application-specific details, and often only application-specific algorithms, are not
part of CompSys. Each of the Top Sectors of the Dutch Economy, each route in the National Research
Agenda, and each of the UN Sustainable Development Goals pose challenges that cannot be addressed
without groundbreaking CompSys advances. Looking at the 2030-2035 horizon, important new
applications will emerge only when enabled by CompSys developments. Triggered by the COVID-19
pandemic, millions moved abruptly online, raising infrastructure scalability and data sovereignty
issues; but governments processing social data and responsible social networks still require a
paradigm shift in data sovereignty and sharing. AI already requires massive computer systems which
can cost millions per training task, but the current technology leaves an unsustainable energy footprint
including large carbon emissions. Computational sciences such as bioinformatics, and “Humanities for
all” and “citizen data science”, cannot become affordable and efficient until computer systems take a
leap. Similarly, the emerging quantum internet depends for the foreseeable future on
generational
(traditional) CompSys to bootstrap operation. Large commercial sectors,
including finance and
manufacturing, require specialized computing and networking or risk to become uncompetitive. And,
at the core of Dutch innovation, promising technology hubs, deltas, ports, and smart cities, could see
their promise stagger due to critical dependency on non-European technology.

Computer systems must be manageable, responsible, sustainable, and usable. To fulfill the
promise of our digitalized future, and avoid the risk of becoming technologically dependent, the
Netherlands must address now four grand societal challenges related to CompSys:

1

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

1. Manageability: How to tame the ever-growing complexity, and related human error, in

massive computer systems and networks?

2. Responsibility: How to realize responsible computer infrastructure – analogous to the
concept of responsible AI – whose operation we can rely on (from privacy, ethical, security,
performance, availability, and durability perspectives)?

3. Sustainability: How to reduce and make the most from the energy footprint of (increasing

levels of) computing?

4. Usability: How to work, within the context of Europe’s digitalization ambitions, with the
critical sectors for the Dutch society, such as industry, healthcare, and governance, to make
computer systems usable and accessible by all? How to enable AI and quantum computing?

Addressing these challenges requires an innovative, multi-year vision and approach...

… through a groundbreaking, holistic, and collective technology roadmap
The Netherlands is well-positioned to be a big player in CompSys, a consequence of its rich legacy in
communications and networking, and of its current community of CompSys researchers. Because we
are at the end of Moore’s Law, and because our society has just started deep digitalization, the time is
ripe for groundbreaking advances in all layers of computer systems and networking, see Figure 1.
Because advances in computer systems are inextricably linked, it is imperative the community takes a
holistic view of computer systems and networks. These fundamental topics require further, equally
fundamental advances in how we do science in the field, and demand collective thinking and action.

… through renewed education, truly accessible for all
As a major contribution to the Dutch society, we need a concerted action to reintroduce systems
thinking as a clear curricular goal, helping our society understand and shape the increasingly
interconnected and complex digitalized world. We need IT professionals with core computer systems
expertise, coming from all backgrounds and from under-represented groups.

… and through a concerted answer to our call to action
In the race to digital empowerment, we see a clear opportunity for Europe and the Netherlands to not
focus on only one aspect of digitalization, e.g., AI algorithms, but to consider CompSys technology
holistically. Motivated by societal needs and encouraged by the strengths of CompSys research in the
Netherlands, we call for a large-scale collective effort and investment in this field. The benefits of
digitalization are enormous and reward every area of our economy and society. However, if we fail to
do this soon, there is a high risk that the CompSys technology and specialists required by our society
will not be available in the Netherlands anymore, further limiting our digital sovereignty. Economically,
the Netherlands cannot out-compete without computer systems and networking research!

Executive summary in Dutch

Samenvatting van het manifest over Nederlands onderzoek naar toekomstige
computersystemen en netwerken

De stuwende kracht op weg naar een verantwoorde en duurzame samenleving?
Computersystemen! Onze moderne samenleving en concurrerende economie zijn afhankelijk van
een sterke digitale basis en, daarom, van onderzoek en innovatie op het gebied van
computersystemen. Computersystemen, variërend van kleine processoren binnen apparaten tot grote
datacenters en de netwerken die ze verbinden, vormen een fascinerend technologiegebied met
belangrijke impact op en kansen voor de samenleving. In dit manifest richten we ons met name op
Nederland, waar datacenters al meer dan 3,3 miljoen banen en meer dan 60% van het BBP
ondersteunen, nieuwe producten en diensten faciliteren, en waar elke €1 die wordt geïnvesteerd in
computersystemen €15 aan toegevoegde waarde genereert. Door vroegtijdig te hebben geïnvesteerd
in netwerkinfrastructuur is Nederland één van de grootste data-hubs ter wereld geworden en maken
vele bedrijven en organisaties dankbaar gebruik van de cloud. Ons doel met dit manifest is om de
grote maatschappelijke, technologische en wetenschappelijke kansen en uitdagingen in toekomstige
computersystemen en netwerken onder de aandacht te brengen en te schetsen hoe Nederland een
leidende positie op dit gebied kan behouden.

Toekomstbestendige digitalisering vereist ICT-onderzoek en -ontwikkeling (R&D). De
Nederlandse overheid en maatschappelijke actoren onderschrijven het belang van ICT. Een
verregaande digitalisering kan huidige activiteiten verbeteren, nieuwe disruptieve ontwikkelingen
stimuleren en leiden tot hoge efficiëntie en, voor het eerst in de geschiedenis, universele toegang tot
ICT. Maar zonder actie zou Nederland zijn prominente rol op het gebied van computersystemen
kunnen verliezen, kunnen ICT-diensten hun flexibele, vertrouwde en veilige status binnen de digitale
economie kwijtraken, riskeren we dat ICT-onderzoekers in Nederland vertrekken naar andere landen
en zou het bestaande tekort aan ICT-geschoolde mensen alleen maar groeien. Onze belangrijkste
bondgenoten, maar ook concurrenten, in de wereld, waaronder Duitsland, Frankrijk, de VS en China,
intensiveren reeds hun langetermijninvesteringen in ICT R&D, met een sterke nadruk op
computersystemen en netwerkinfrastructuur. En in Europa groeit het besef dat ICT ook soeverein en
volgens Europese normen en waarden moet worden ingezet.

Met dit manifest vestigen we de aandacht op computersystemen als vitaal onderdeel van
ICT. Computersystemen omvatten alle hardware en alle operationele softwarelagen die ICT

belangrijke nieuwe diensten en toepassingen ontstaan   als de ontwikkelingen in computersystemen dit
mogelijk maken. Als gevolg van de COVID-19-pandemie zijn miljoenen mensen abrupt online gegaan,
waardoor problemen met data-privacy en opschalen zijn ontstaan. Kunstmatige intelligentie (AI)
vereist al enorme computersystemen, kan miljoenen kosten om te trainen, en heeft een
onverantwoord grote energiehonger. Computerwetenschappen zoals bio-informatica, kunnen niet
betaalbaar en efficiënt worden zonder een nieuwe generatie computersystemen. Evenzo is het
opkomende kwantuminternet afhankelijk van (traditionele) computersystemen en netwerken. Grote
commerciële sectoren, waaronder financiën en de maakindustrie, vereisen gespecialiseerde computers
en netwerken. En veelbelovende technologie-hubs, havens en slimme steden riskeren afhankelijk te
worden van niet-Europese technologie.

Computersystemen moeten beheersbaar, verantwoord, duurzaam en bruikbaar zijn. Om de
potentie van onze gedigitaliseerde toekomst waar te maken en het risico van technologische
afhankelijkheid te vermijden, moet Nederland nu vier grote maatschappelijke uitdagingen aanpakken
met betrekking tot computersystemen:

1. Beheersbaarheid: Hoe moet de steeds groter wordende complexiteit, en de daarmee

samenhangende menselijke fouten, in enorme computersystemen en netwerken getemd worden?

2. Verantwoordelijkheid: Hoe een verantwoorde computerinfrastructuur te realiseren – analoog
aan het concept van verantwoordelijke AI – waarop we kunnen vertrouwen (vanuit het oogpunt
van privacy, ethiek, beveiliging, prestatie, beschikbaarheid en duurzaamheid)?

3. Duurzaamheid: Hoe het energieverbruik van (toenemend) computergebruik te verminderen en

optimaal benutten?

4. Bruikbaarheid: Hoe samen te werken, in het kader van de ambities van Europa aangaande
digitalisering, met de voor de Nederlandse samenleving cruciale sectoren, zoals industrie, zorg en
bestuur, om computersystemen voor iedereen bruikbaar en toegankelijk te maken? Hoe in de
digitale infrastructurele basis voor AI en quantum te voorzien?

Het aangaan van deze uitdagingen vraagt   om een   innovatieve, meerjarige visie en aanpak...

… door middel van een baanbrekende, holistische technologie-roadmap
Nederland is goed gepositioneerd om een   grote speler in computersystemen te zijn, vanwege zijn rijke
historie op het gebied van communicatie en netwerken, en vanwege zijn huidige gemeenschap van
onderzoekers op dat gebied. Omdat onze samenleving verregaande ambities heeft rond digitalisering,
is de tijd rijp voor baanbrekende vooruitgang in alle lagen van computersystemen en netwerken. Denk

aan
ontwikkelingsplatforms, etc. Omdat de verscheidene aspecten van computersystemen onlosmakelijk
met elkaar verbonden zijn, is het voor vooruitgang absoluut noodzakelijk dat men een holistische kijk
op computersystemen en -netwerken neemt. Deze fundamentele onderwerpen vereisen dus ook een
even fundamentele vooruitgang in de manier waarop we wetenschap bedrijven, namelijk richting
holistisch systeem-denken en handelen.

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

Introduction

Computer systems and networks (CompSys) are the backbone of the digital infrastructure and, thus,
are essential for all critical economic sectors and societal aspects of the Netherlands. Every bit of
stored data and every computational task rely on a computer system to run on and, increasingly, on a
network to reach it. A myriad of IoT and mobile devices produce vast streams of data, joining
enterprise big data processes in using exabytes of data in the cloud or at the edge. In our modern
digital economy, to “out-compete is to out-compute”. The business environment of the Netherlands,
an economy of nearly 1 trillion EUR per year [17], relies on computer systems and networks for daily
operations, growth, and R&D. Data centers, which are enormous networked computer systems,
support over 3.3 million jobs in the Netherlands and provide essential cloud services to the Dutch
society during (rapid) digital transitions such as that caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; a staggering
60% of the GDP depends on digital operations running in Dutch and internationally operated data
centers [7]. Computer systems operate decision-making and artificial intelligence-powered processes,
collect and process big data, give access to performant and dependable cloud services, and make the
digital infrastructure sustainable. The computer systems and networking field achieves this through
diverse methods for creating, structuring, and organizing computing components and their
communication networks, centering the components in well-behaved mechanisms and dynamic
policies, using resource management, scheduling, and feedback loops, and enabling developers to
interact with systems programmatically.

A responsible and sustainable future for the Netherlands relies on computer systems and networks.
The list of sectors and domains that would benefit enormously from digitalization is broad, and
includes: smart industry, intelligent healthcare, energy transition and energy markets, smart mobility
and logistics, digital remote work, digital twins, digital entertainment and online gaming, digital
government, digital education, digital culture, FinTech, smart agriculture, democratized and citizen
science, the fourth paradigm of science (big science), and the emerging fields using AI and quantum
computing.

Although the CompSys field has sustained remarkable developments since 1990, to achieve and
improve digitalization it is imperative that our digital infrastructure keeps innovating. The arguments
are pragmatic: Today, every €1 invested in computer systems generates €15 in added value for the
Dutch economy, and innovation in computer systems, networks, and services hires an increasingly
larger number of people, beyond the average economic sector [7]. However, the environmental cost is
not cheap: Data centers powering cloud services consume about 3% of the national electricity budget,
up from about 1% only 5 years ago, more and growing faster than in other countries (e.g., the US)
and in the Netherlands significantly more than other infrastructure (e.g., for public transport [39]). With
current technology, the amount of computer systems resources used for training AI systems is
doubling every 3.5 months, threatening to become unsustainable and unecological [28]. Beyond mere
numbers, the operation of government and societal services depends on increasing automation.
Significant advances in CompSys technology are needed for each of the major routes in the National
Research Agenda [39], each of the Top Sectors of the Dutch Economy [39], and each of the UN
Sustainable Development Goals. Digital
infrastructure is identified as an essential and thus far
underrepresented part of the AI Research Agenda for the Netherlands [15]; AI systems cannot work
without (new) computer systems and networks [28]. Similarly, the emerging quantum technology
requires (traditional) computer systems to bootstrap operation [24], and should continue to act as a
powerful complement rather than replacement for the next decades. These scenarios set the stage for
four grand societal challenges in the Netherlands (the columns in the grid in Figure 1):

1. Manageability: Only two decades ago, connecting to the Internet and executing an application
across multiple machines were grand challenges in CompSys; today, these are trivial tasks. The

5

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

unprecedented capability of CompSys infrastructure led to a Cambrian explosion of new,
heterogeneous technologies, addressing important societal demands but adding new challenges.
However, to provide ICT services, all these technologies need to work together, often under the
supervision of human experts. How to tame the ever-growing complexity, and related human
error, in massive computer systems and networks?

2. Responsibility: As society is increasingly being digitalized, the importance of responsible
CompSys is becoming paramount. Computing is shifting to a post-Moore’s law world, where the
principles change and performance advances cannot be taken for granted after nearly seven
decades of rapid increase.
In the last decade, scale and diversity have made CompSys
infrastructures much less dependable, and security and privacy breaches have become so common
that they can be now seen as the rule rather than the exception. Reliability and dependability are
also advocated for software by VERSEN [53]. How to realize responsible CompSys infrastructure –
analogous to the concept of responsible AI – whose operation we can trust and depend on? How to
ensure privacy and security, along with performance, availability, and durability? How to enable
ethical ICT for everyone?

3. Sustainability: “Fueled” by the European Green Deal, there are serious concerns regarding the
energy footprint of
(increasing levels of) digitalization. Other greenhouse emissions and
consumption of limited resources are also major concerns. How to make the most from the energy
footprint of computing? How to use electricity and resources most efficiently and how to offset
their environmental cost? How to scale deployments elastically, on-demand? How to make use of
efficient, power- and otherwise resource-constrained devices?

4. Usability: Critical sectors for the Dutch society, such as industry, healthcare, and government,
need support to digitalize. People without digital skills or, worse, access to digital services could
become effectively excluded from society. Questions of cross-disciplinary, translational science [30]
arise, linked for example with the Dutch AI vision for an AI infrastructure [15]: How to work with
these domains to make CompSys technology usable and accessible by all, and flexible enough to
become valuable across all societal applications? How to test these properties, and gain valuable
feedback for fundamental CompSys science? The Netherlands must also pursue interoperation
with and integration into a sovereign EU technology landscape: Currently, our digital
foundation is using mainly non-European technology, from Big Tech companies and countries that
do not (need to) adhere to our data-privacy and societal goals. The European Union has started to
react to this situation, with flagship R&D programs that aim to create core European technology,
focusing on high-performance processors, high-speed Internet, energy-efficient and secure cloud,
and sovereign data hubs. How to make Dutch R&D in computer systems and networks align,
integrate, and interoperate with European technology platforms, and meet the EU societal and
economic goals? Moreover, the grand goals related to AI and machine learning, and further in the
future to quantum computing, depend on computer systems and networks as prime enabler and
bootstrapping infrastructure.

We can overcome these grand societal challenges and transform them into great opportunities for the
Dutch society. The Netherlands is well-positioned to digitalize society as a whole and maintain a
competitive advantage. This is a consequence of its rich, multi-decade tradition, and of its current
community of CompSys researchers, whose productivity, quality, and vision are recognized
world-wide [6][12][13][18][19][27][41][46][51][52]. The Netherlands has a high-impact legacy and continues to
play a prominent role in the development of computer systems and network technologies, from virtual
laboratories for science to fintech and AI systems, from big data management to data hubs, from WiFi
and Bluetooth communication to widespread Internet rollout. A thread ties history (for example, the
Netherlands was the first European country to connect to the Internet) to present (for example,
Amsterdam hosts one of the world’s largest Internet Exchanges and the largest data hub in Europe,

6

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

and various Big Tech companies are trying to establish here some of the largest data centers in
Europe). These pioneering efforts have been a catalyst for the digital economy of the Netherlands,
which today is among the best in the world, as for instance is illustrated in a report on the future of
the Dutch digital economy [28].

However, that same report also indicates that Dutch digital infrastructure is at risk of losing its top
position [28]. Worryingly, the Netherlands may be entering a state of “digital disconnect”: Already, many
aspects of the data centers and networks in the Netherlands are designed, manufactured, and even
operated in non-EU countries, thus dwindling our digital sovereignty and draining critical Dutch
expertise. Continuing to invest in these non-EU technologies may place the Netherlands in the
unwanted situation where it has not aligned its digital strategy with Europe, yet it ends up needing
access to the European infrastructure and digital market without being part of the research and
decision-making processes underpinning this emerging infrastructure. The world has already started to
up its commitment to new CompSys infrastructure, and in CompSys research: The US, Japan, and
China, world-wide, and in Europe the main export-partners of the Netherlands, such as Germany,
France, Belgium, and the UK, have made ever-larger investments to match increasingly more
ambitious, ground-breaking goals in the last few years [29]. Small countries with outsized economies,
such as Switzerland, have adopted similar policies. Large investments in AI systems have been
matched by large (and even larger) investments in computer systems in all these countries.

Turning the tide requires a concerted effort that, inspired by our rich legacy, pushes the envelope in
digital
infrastructure through foundational CompSys research, innovative education linked to
CompSys research, and cross-disciplinary advances through translational research [30] in
CompSys. We formulate around these aspects an integrated vision in the field through horizon
2035. The research and education priorities identified in this vision require significant investment
from the government and co-funding by industry, on-par with the benefits brought by successful
CompSys technology and tolerating the risks of fundamental research; the Dutch Government needs
to invest, because the local industry cannot do this alone, and the international industry has different
priorities and may not invest in such disruptive technology. Moreover, other countries subsidize or
otherwise fund their ICT infrastructure, possibly leading to an unfair advantage vs. the Dutch industry.
Figure 1 links the foundational research themes in CompSys to cross-disciplinary advances with
outstanding impact on society. We also formulate general priorities, such as a coalition of CompSys
experts and users of (and in the Netherlands we have started to do so, through the IPN SIG in Future
Computer and Network Systems1), and a broad digital infrastructure tailored to the needs of the
Netherlands and accessible to the entire society. Because demands are varied, for example, computing
needs in AI, big data, scientific computing, and business are very different from each other, the
infrastructure should cover judiciously the full spectrum of computer systems, from High-Performance
Computing (HPC) to cloud to edge to IoT, and from networks to beyond 5G communications.

To address the societal challenges, we identify seven foundational research themes in CompSys
(the rows in the grid in Figure 1). They correspond to both historical and newly emerging foci among
CompSys scientists, engineers, and other industry and societal stakeholders. They are driven by
mainstay needs, such as high-performance processors, high-speed Internet, energy-efficient and
secure cloud, and sovereign data hubs, and by novel paradigms, such as post-Moore and non-von
Neumann hardware, the development of wireless, optical, edge, and beyond-5G services including
low-latency and high data-rate, the moonshot of a transition toward a digitalized society launched by
the Dutch Government [8], etc. They enable strong economic effects (see the box “Economic and
societal impact of CompSys in the Netherlands”), to both established companies such as ASML, Adyen,
and Booking.com, and to startup ecosystems that could enable the next break-through. But all these
require overcoming the next research challenges. Uniquely, computer systems and networks are by

definition composites, meaning the weakest part limits the capability of the entire system, so
advances in one part at once reinforce and challenge the others. We identify seven foundational
research themes, which only when addressed together can ensure the four societal pillars
are enabled:

1. Ecosystems of data and application markets: designing and massivizing distributed

ecosystems, that is, composites of interconnected (distributed) systems. Challenges:
(1) creating processes that enable and facilitate pragmatic and innovative ecosystems, while
focusing holistically on challenges including performance, scalability, availability, privacy, trust,
security,
(2) developing and calibrating
approaches for (ethical) experimentation and design space exploration; and (3) developing the
processes, tools, and standards to compose and deliver meaningful applications to empower
digitalization and fulfill the grand societal challenges.

(data) ownership, and ecosystem sustainability;

2. Development platforms: providing specialized tools for

testing, and
deployment of (complex) applications that need to run over multiple machines and multiple tiers
of devices. Challenges: (1) providing integrated development for the system as a whole; (2)
dealing with system-level trade-offs; and (3) linking to software life-cycle, e.g., testing.

the development,

3. Runtime engines: translating digital applications into smaller units of computation easily
understood and executed by modern computer systems. Challenges: (1) automate runtime
engines without loss of performance, efficiency, security, etc., by scaling resources elastically and
managing them; and (2) commodify them as services, by creating common, interoperable runtime
engines that support different operational models and per-task/-user QoS needs.

4. Resource management: provisioning and allocating resources and services to ensure a
specialized, distributed and parallel, environment. Challenges: designing algorithms and
schedulers for fine-grained, QoS-driven (1) multi-tenant resource allocation, aggregation, and
disaggregation; (2) workload and data orchestration, federation, and re-use.

5. Operating systems and foundational services: co-designing software and hardware for

efficient operation within a single machine and over distributed setups. Challenges:
(1) rethinking operating systems; and (2) designing flexible yet efficient multi-node (distributed)
services.

6. Hardware infrastructure: providing compute, memory, storage, and network resources, both
physical and virtual, for specific purposes. Challenges: (1) designing and developing the new
generation of computing, networking, and sensing hardware, some general-purpose, some
specialized for and co-designed with applications; (2) creating the foundations of virtual and in
particular software-defined resources; (3) linking these resources to any deployment and
environment.

7. Holistic, system-wide qualities: providing system-wide functionals and non-functionals, and
specializing for particular goals. Challenges: (1) supporting performance, availability, reliability,
security, energy-proportionality, stability, portability, and correctness; (2) enabling trustworthy
operation; (3) ensuring simplicity, composability, and maintainability; (4) ensuring responsible
operation;
sustainability. Note the
complementarity between this research challenge and some of the cross-disciplinary societal
challenges, which provide context beyond CompSys for the (non-)functionals.

(5) ensuring energy-efficiency and, more generally,

The remainder of our manifesto proposes a research and education agenda along the seven
foundational research themes, and further makes ten recommendations regarding computer

8

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

systems and networking research, technology, and education in the Netherlands. We call for urgent
and clear action to bolster the human and technical CompSys potential of the Netherlands. Our
overarching goal is to help the Dutch society stakeholders realize the potential of CompSys research in
the Netherlands, by creating today new opportunities that push the boundaries of what computers and
networks will be able to achieve tomorrow, and building on this potential a modern, sustainable, and
CompSys-empowered future. If we fail to do this soon, digitalization in the Netherlands will lack its
backbone or, worse, sovereignty over it.

Economic and societal impact of CompSys in the Netherlands

CompSys facilitates directly and indirectly many socio-economic activities in the Netherlands.
Although the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) does not track distinctly and with fine grain the ICT,
IT, and digital sectors, which are the main direct developers and beneficiaries of CompSys
technology, several studies [36] assess the direct, indirect, and spillover effects of these sectors, in
both economic and social terms.

Direct economic impact and job market growth:
1.

In terms of direct impact on economic activity, “there can be no digital economy without digital
infrastructure” [36]. The Dutch data center and cloud industry supports over 25% of the
professionals in their daily work, a fraction which will exceed 35% by 2025 [36]. The total labor
force at the end of Q4 of 2020 is 9.2 million, of which 8.9 million are employed.

3.

2. The total Dutch Internet economy has an added value for the Dutch economy of over 110
billion EUR and supports over 330,000 jobs, of which 264,000 directly in ICT [36]. There are
strong links with the European ICT sector and beyond, leading to large foreign investment in
the Netherlands and various exports.
In 2019, the entire ICT infrastructure sector hired about 22,000 people, and produced €6.1
billion in total revenue and €3.1 billion as value added; by 2025, this should grow to 26,400
jobs (3% growth), €8.8 billion total revenue (6% yearly growth), and €4.5 billion value added
(7% yearly growth) [36]. The data centers area alone created at least 12,800 jobs through 2020
and will provide 16,800 jobs by 2024 [36].

4. CBS estimates [36] the Dutch ICT sector yields an average gross value added of 5.2%, much
higher than the average economic sector, which adds only 2.3%. Consequently, the field is
growing with 5-6% yearly on average, and with nearly 10% for the ICT manufacturing area,
which is much faster than the average sector.

5. Late-2020, CBS estimates [36] the total number of employees in the ICT sector exceeded
450,000, or about 5% of the total workforce (an increase of 9% since 2018), with over
three-quarters having steady employment and 66,000 self-employing. These are well-paid
jobs, as payment in ICT-intensive sectors is 18% more than in other sectors [36].

Indirect economic impact and job market growth, plus spillover effects:
1. CompSys sectors indirectly are expected to contribute to taxable, value-adding economic
activity of €2.4 trillion (33% total added-value, rising) over the next 10 years, and impact
economic activity of over €6 trillion over 10 years (60% of the GDP, rising), employing directly
and indirectly over 3.3 million people [36].
In the Dutch digital economy, every €1 turnover in ICT infrastructure and services generates
€15 in added value (projected €22 by 2025) [36]. This is much higher than the return on
investment found for the US digital economy in 2018, where $1 invested in cloud services leads
to $2.5 average net return on investment and a maximum of about $10 [36].

2.

3. The added value of digitization and digitalized processes that characterize the next-generation
digital economy in the Netherlands is estimated at €242 billion (33% total added-value) in
2019, and will increase to over €320 billion (40% total added-value) by 2025 [36]. This is faster
growth than for other European economies or the US [36].

4. Pb7 estimates [36] the collective Dutch digital hub hires directly and indirectly about 39,000
people, with €4.8 billion added value. This is comparable with the physical Rotterdam Haven
(largest impact, with 120,000 jobs and €14.5 billion added value) and Schiphol Airport

9

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

(second-largest, with 93,000 jobs and €10 billion added value). However, the digital hub is
growing faster (3-3.5x), has a much higher scalability ceiling through the 21st century, and
already has an outsized indirect impact on the Dutch economy (2-3x larger).

5. CompSys has important spillover effects into GovTech, FinTech, energy transition, AI, and
quantum computing, to name but a few immediate effects. For example, in the Netherlands,
the GovTech industry is rapidly growing, with an addressable market on Justice and Safety of
around €500 million, out of a total market for GovTech of €3.4 billion in 2021 [34]; in the EU, the
GovTech industry is also growing, and has already reached €104 billion in 2021 [34].

Societal impact, through societal goods and services:
1.

Inclusion and adult skills are greatly benefited by a generally available, non-discriminatory ICT
infrastructure. Digital skills related to CompSys are essential skills for the workforce of the
future. Access to ICT infrastructure for all should become a fundamental human
right [18].

2. Many public services are moving online, including government online information services,
online administration and taxation, digital signature and passporting, and even online politics.
GovTech based on CompSys can help reduce administrative overload for public offices, and also
facilitate access to such services in the general population, with less time, stress, and
discrimination, easier detection of inconsistency or fraud, and easier application of rules and
regulations.

3. Education, especially during the pandemic, is employing more digital services, which can
facilitate sharing material, simplify academic accounting, and enable online access to experts
and to sophisticated virtual
labs. Services in health and social care, especially related to
hospitals, could benefit in the same way.

4. The energy transition in the Netherlands depends on CompSys transition. Although this will
also lead to significant economic opportunities and challenges, the climate impact achieved
through this is a priceless societal service for future generations. Similar considerations apply
to construction, agriculture and food production, water and urban management, and transport
and mobility.

5. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT has acted as the main infrastructure for the general
population, surpassing in economic importance any physical infrastructure. The return from this
situation will likely not happen soon, if at all.

Summarizing, we argue in this manifesto for sustained investment in R&D in the CompSys area.
CompSys is a fundamental enabler among ICT technologies, so commoditizing and outsourcing it
greatly reduces the innovation and competitiveness potential of
the Netherlands. Although
investment in fundamental research is not enough to obtain societal benefits, the Netherlands has a
strong ICT innovation ecosystem. Promising technology hubs, deltas, ports, and smart cities give
innovation a chance for local (and global) success. The Netherlands has active university incubators,
vibrant accelerators and crystallizers, and savvy (VC) investors.

I. Research and Education Agenda

The strategic positioning of the Dutch CompSys community in the European and global landscape
enable it to take a prominent role in addressing the critical challenges and opportunities that lie ahead
in CompSys research and education, as outlined in this part.

Because CompSys thrives on combining many technologies into complex ecosystems, it takes time
until a fundamental problem becomes noticed by the end-users of such systems -- in industry,
governance, or society. A brief timeline exemplifies this. For many decades, computer systems
leveraged inventions and trends from the 1960s, especially the microprocessor with complex
architecture and Moore’s economic law of exponential growth in the number of transistors per
processor. These have enabled large gains in performance and cost, sometimes of several orders of
magnitude larger than gains in other technologies and fields. But in the mid-2000s, these trends
started to be overturned by the laws of physics and by the unsustainability of the approach into the
future. Society became increasingly aware; for example, companies could not rely anymore on new
devices offering large increases of performance over time (due to Moore’s law). This led to a paradigm
investment in research and development, which has resulted in
shift, based on sustained global
fundamental advances in computer systems and a new generation of CompSys technology:
innovations in GPUs, TPUs, and other novel processors, distributed storage hardware and software,
programmable networks, new data center stacks, and many others. Together with important
interdisciplinary advances, such as in systems software engineering, systems resource management,
and systems performance engineering, these ground-breaking scientific advances and methods will
allow us to prototype and even deliver infrastructure with purpose and scale befitting the start of the
21st century. The Netherlands has strong competences in all
these areas, with high-quality
researchers located in Amsterdam, Delft, Eindhoven, Groningen, Leiden, and Twente, among others.

A trend of diversification beyond control also emerged in the 21st century. Whereas, since the 1970s,
a narrow range of computer systems were available for a specific computing task and one could afford
to learn a specific computer tool running on a specific computer and operating system, the present
and especially the future are much more diverse. CompSys is currently taking a fundamental step, to
the principles of plurality and diversity in (networked) computer systems technology, and more
specifically to computer and network ecosystems where many different components developed for
different purposes and by different teams evolve subject to relatively limited control of any single
user; a related trend was observed for software engineering by VERSEN [53]. This will give the
maximum opportunity for everyone in the society to benefit and take part in a fully digitalized society.
However, this raises new challenges and opportunities that require high-quality research in computer
and network ecosystems, which in turn will feed into our educational and professional development
programmes. The Netherlands is well-positioned to become a leader also in these areas, especially
through the clusters in Amsterdam, Delft, and Leiden, but needs a large investment in a national
infrastructure for CompSys research to match this ambition.

Due to the many recent advances, education in CompSys technology currently has to cope with the
complexity and diversity of topics without much help from traditional theory. Moreover, many problems
are complex, non-intuitive, and require critical thinking to reach a solution. Thus, research-oriented
education in this area, coupled with focus on experiments and empirical work, are staples of
curricula that want to stay relevant. Because these aspects are costly and need refinement over time,
and to educate and train a truly diverse slice of the society in CompSys technology, the
Netherlands requires significant and sustained investments in CompSys education.

1. Priorities in Foundational CompSys Research

The time is ripe for groundbreaking advances in computer systems and networking. The CompSys
researchers in the Netherlands are ideally positioned to offer leadership, and in particular in the last 5
years have provided (peer-reviewed) thought leadership for key topics: massivizing computer systems
to achieve efficient, dependable, and sustainable computer ecosystems [18]; making a responsible
Internet [13]; linking the cloud to edge into a computational continuum and pervasive data processing
environment [41]; making the memory to storage continuum a reality [46]; co-designing hardware and
software; interconnecting embedded systems, sensors, and IoT; enabling dynamic workload and
resource management for the new societal needs and emerging workloads such as large-scale
machine learning [52], graph processing [31][44], and online gaming [6]; providing full automation of ICT
services and in particular concerns about infrastructure through serverless computing [31]; rethinking
telemetry, monitoring, and real-time observation [50]; enabling programmability across all layers and
components; seeking the principles of digital sovereignty and digital markets, etc. These fundamental
topics require further, equally fundamental advances in how we do science in the field. We include
here rethinking experimentation, simulation [19], reproducibility [51], and other essential methods;
re-designing core processes for the performance engineering, software engineering, and design [19] of
new computer systems; and re-linking the novel results into education together with new approaches
to education in CompSys [20].

1.1 Ecosystems

Our modern lifestyle depends on computer and network ecosystems, which combine all the other
technology layers in Figure 1. The fundamental challenges include understanding, developing, and
re-thinking the integrated technology; and also the processes and tools to engineer ecosystems
aligned with EU goals and infrastructures, to enable computing and networking as a true utility.

As the backbone of the digital society, computer and network ecosystems provide the infrastructure
for business, science, governance, and consumer applications. They create the necessary economies
of scale that underpin broad participation and the innovation generating economic growth.
Conceptually, ecosystems are composites of computer and network systems; and, recursively or as an
overlap, of other ecosystems. Modern computer ecosystems exhibit a diversity of structure,
components, and behavior that rivals biological ecosystems. Thus, the main challenge is to
integrate all these composites. Fundamental research challenges here include: (1) establish the
fundamental theory to predict ecosystem operation, dynamics, and evolution; (2) establish processes
and develop tools to re-engineer key parts of existing ecosystems to gain observability and control,
and ultimately sovereignty, over their operation in the spirit of the Dutch societal values and subject to
EU and Dutch laws; (3) re-think ecosystems to meet by 2035 the key technical and societal aspects of
manageability, responsibility, sustainability, and usability (the verticals in Figure 1); (4) by 2035,
enable computing and networking ecosystems as the key utility they aim to be, providing
techno-social and cyber-physical solutions across the computational continuum. As an orthogonal
issue, (5) test the approaches empirically, systematically, and comprehensively. Table 1.1 summarizes
the major topics, innovations, and technical terms.

The Netherlands is well positioned to play a leadership role in CompSys ecosystems in the world.
Following pioneering work in distributed computing ecosystems in the past decade, the clusters in
Amsterdam, Delft, and Leiden have established groundbreaking lines of research in the field, starting
from the central premise that ecosystem dynamics and evolution, rather than the study of individual
components
to understanding and engineering ecosystems. Key
contributions so far include establishing research programmes [13][18]; detailing some of the key

in isolation, are essential

12

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

problems tackled in these programmes [41][46][51][52]; establishing new design [19] and experimentation
[27][51] processes for ecosystems, the last aligned with the ASCI vision for the NWO-funded DAS
experimental platform; advancing resource management and (elastic) scheduling; increasing support
for both general and specialized, and in general heterogeneous, resources and services; advancing
capacity planning with a focus on long-term sustainability; establishing theoretical models (reference
architectures) for emerging ecosystems, such as serverless computing [31]; considering fundamental
aspects of reproducibility [51]; interoperating ecosystems; assessing and reducing operational risk;
operating across computational continuum [46]; understanding availability and reliability of ecosystem
services; uncovering emergent phenomena; understanding service use and adoption for various
societal stakeholders [10]; developing and validating statistical and process-based models of ecosystem
operations. These new lines of research should continue.

The open research lines aim to further address the four main societal challenges and include: enabling
software-defined everything, including with humans in the loop; strengthening and expanding the role
of non-functional requirements (NFRs, or the “how?” of the ecosystem) next to functionals (the
“what?”); self-awareness supported by robust, explainable, and responsible AI/ML techniques;
enabling super-distribution; new methodological approaches combining cross-disciplinary techniques
from CompSys, software engineering, data management, and performance engineering; creating
ecosystem visors, observers, and navigators for experts and the general public; creating reference
models and predictive evolutionary theories to explain the formation and change of computer
ecosystems [18]; etc. Applications of this research impact every aspect of the digitalization moonshot,
including: efficient ICT-infrastructure management and operation, e.g., for a scalable, trusted, secure,
and sustainable cloud; aligned with the Dutch AI Coalition (Nederlandse AI Coalitie) and the
DutchAI vision [15], ecosystems for large-scale ML/DL with application in a variety of fields; aligned also
with the SURF vision [45], flexible, scalable, dependable, and secure and ecosystems for science and big
scientific computing, and for education; aligned with “the fourth paradigm for science”, support for
workflow- and data-driven computational sciences [14]; ICT infrastructure for democratizing science and
enabling “citizen science”; pioneering computational models with a variety of applications, e.g.,
serverless computing [31] and graph processing [31]; national security (examples combine AI/ML and
graph processing); future banking ecosystems; logistics; online gaming [6]; etc.

demonstration,

proof-of-concept,

Researchers in the Netherlands already have access to basic research infrastructure to test their
and grand
solutions,
experimentation is currently lacking, thus posing clear threats to this field of study. Investment in this
area, on-par with investments in the US (CloudLab, Chameleon sponsored by the government,
environments shared by each Big Tech company), Germany, and other countries, is necessary. With
this investment, the Netherlands could continue its participation in and links with EOSC, GEANT,
ESFRI/SLICES, Gaia-X. On a small scale, the Dutch CompSys community has built elements of this
infrastructure by complementing small seed-funding with its own equipment and volunteered
administrative work, which indicates that researchers need and value research infrastructure. For
example, the networking community joined under the 2STiC programme2 and set up a nationwide test
network consisting of programmable network devices, and the computer systems community formed
the ASCI Doctoral School3 and set up the nationwide distributed computing testbed DAS [2].

1.2 Development Platforms

Users interact with computer systems through a diverse portfolio of applications. The extraordinary
increase in demand for applications - from digital entertainment and online gaming to personalized,
intelligent healthcare and digital education, combined with the unprecedented sophistication of
emergent functionality, mandates research into the design and implementation of effective and
efficient development platforms, combining programming models and languages,
libraries,
compilers, and analysis tools, where productivity and flexibility play a central role.

User-diversity leads to a constant, fast-paced increase in the demand for novel, complex applications,
often spanning multiple machines and multiple tiers of devices (including IoT). Without specialized
tools, the development, testing, and deployment of such applications is simply too slow. At the same
time, the technological push from the hardware and system architecture promises unprecedented
performance and efficiency. Yet such emerging new technology must be made accessible to developers
to facilitate the creation of novel applications that leverage these advances. Offering the right
platforms to developers is the traditional domain of software engineering and programming languages,
which are based,
implicitly or explicitly, on specific programming models and abstractions, and
substantial ecosystems of libraries and productivity tools that have emerged around them.

Development platforms must respond to the increased systems heterogeneity and high application
complexity and diversity. To this end, innovation on the development platforms is an urgent and
inevitable necessity in order to prevent a growing divide between hardware and software. Such
innovation, however, must be guided by the human factor, as novel concepts and approaches must be
made accessible to developers in the form of meaningful programming language constructs and
effective tooling around them.

Addressing systems heterogeneity requires revising the design principles of development platforms in
view of new emerging trade-offs between transparency, level of abstraction, and efficiency. The notion

14

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

of transparency is a somewhat contentious topic in the area of development platforms, which becomes
increasingly relevant again. Traditionally, coarse abstractions provide a perception of high usability and
transparency, but gloss over the operational semantics of modern and sophisticated hardware without
providing means for the programmers to interact with the hardware explicitly. As such, transparency
may prevent efficiency and can, in some cases, even pose a threat to application correctness. For
instance, the lack of explicit memory models in many traditional system-level programming languages
like C has been the root cause for a plethora of difficult concurrency bugs, some of which only surface
on specific hardware. Embedding explicit support for the relaxed memory models that modern
hardware employs to facilitate better scalability of the chip designs towards larger numbers of
compute cores is paramount to building robust and efficient applications. The same can be said for
supporting more flexible concurrency models and asynchronous I/O operations to better align with
how modern hardware functions.

To tackle application diversity and complexity,
there is an increased focus on (distributed)
programming at large, covering the edge-to-cloud continuum. Novel programming models and
abstractions like serverless computing or Function as a Service promise high performance and
efficiency for even fine-grained operations, expressing the coarse-grained parallelism required to scale
large applications to the powerful and diverse infrastructure, but raise systems challenges even when
managing small stateless functions [31], and more for general applications [31].

Thus, the grand challenge we face is to design and implement integrated platforms that
provide programmability and flexibility for applications and services development for the
system as a whole. To this end, the following fundamental challenges must be addressed:
(1) redesign abstractions for programming models to efficiently handle heterogeneity at multiple
system layers, (2) design platforms with integrated support for large-scale, parallel and distributed
programming, (3) design effective analysis/verification tools for aspects like correctness and
performance, including AI-assisted programming and program synthesis, (4) support analytical and
simulation-based models for portability and system-wide application prediction, and (5) provide
tunable trade-offs between transparency, efficiency, and programmability, enabling users to choose
the required levels of support, integration, and automation.

The Netherlands has a long tradition in designing development platforms,
from compilers to
programming languages. For example, research groups from VU Amsterdam, UvA, and CWI provide
development platforms and tools for high-performance computing, machine learning, and embedded
(real-time) systems, while research groups at TU Delft, TU/e, and U. Twente provide high-level
programming models for specialized processors (like FPGAs and CGRAs), and groups at U. Groningen
and U. Twente provide advanced analysis tools. However, the field is fragmented, and lacks the
resources for a concerted research effort towards integration. We argue that tighter integration and
wider adoption require fundamental research across all stakeholders - e.g., through a national effort
towards providing the next-generation development platforms -, to prevent further fragmentation.

1.3 Runtime Engines

Runtime engines are the glue layer between modern applications and the computing, storage, and
networking infrastructure. Runtime engines provide excellent opportunities for optimization and
efficiency, but must respond to any significant changes in applications or infrastructure; this is a
continuous challenge that, if lost, threatens to cancel out the benefits of any new technology - here,
lack of innovation is lack of benefit.

Runtime engines use a variety of techniques to automate the use of compute, storage, and network
infrastructure for specific applications. They simplify development by automating the use of various
ICT resources and deployment by automating application-execution under various dynamic
phenomena. They also provide critical
feedback to both the application and the infrastructure
operators. Runtime engines orchestrate the execution of complex applications, offering the developer
sophisticated yet usable programming interfaces for advanced control. They coordinate with the
Resource Management layer how to respond to the varying demands for ICT resources---e.g., by
translating digital applications into smaller units of computation easily understood and executed by
modern computer systems, or by elastically scaling the number of (virtualized or containerized)
computing nodes as needed by the current phase of computation---; this two-level coordination is
essential for achieving efficiency in modern ICT infrastructure, and without two-level coordination
there can be orders-of-magnitude more resource consumption and lower performance than with it.
Because innovation here depends on how emerging applications and infrastructure innovations will
catch on, this field is characterized by high-risk, high-reward developments.

Currently, the runtime engine landscape is very diverse, with each application domain proposing
engines to run specific application-functionality, e.g., Spark for big data, Tensorflow for AI/ML,
Horovod for computation distribution, HDFS and HopsFS for storage, P4Runtime for P4-programmable
networks, etc. Phenomena that emerged in the operation of modern computer systems, such as
performance variability, impact of correlated failures, etc., have highly specific and non-linear impact
on different application types. Thus, each runtime engine currently requires expert-knowledge to
deploy, manage, and evolve. They involve one-time-off approaches, which are costly and error-prone,
and not at all future-proof. Thus, the current approach is not sustainable in the long run.

The grand challenge in runtime engines is to continue to innovate in its core operations,
sustainably anticipating how emerging applications and ICT technologies will interact, and
continuing to integrate with the Development Platforms and Resource Management layers.

16

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

(2) provide processes and tools to support

The fundamental research challenges here include: (1) innovate in execution engines, memory and
storage engines, and network engines, trading off capabilities with expertise required to leverage
them,
the evolutionary process of migrating
domain-specific capabilities to the Resource Management layer, simultaneously reducing the expert
knowledge needed to deploy, manage, and evolve these capabilities, and, conversely, extending and
adapting capabilities from the Resource Management layer for specific domains, and
(3) provide needed capabilities for observability, reporting, and fine-grained accounting, but also
(4) create processes and tools for common, interoperable, even cooperating runtime engines across
applications and infrastructures [14], (5) offer support for emerging needs in emerging application
domains (layer Development Platforms), especially as expressed in emerging programming models,
abstractions, and interfaces, and (6) leverage the support offered by emerging capabilities and
operational modes of emerging hardware and software services (layer Resource Management),
especially as expressed in emerging resource management and scheduling processes. Approaches
may overlap and integrate with those in neighboring layers, but even then will pose unique challenges
due to the adaptation to specific application domains. For example, an ongoing challenge is (7) the
transition of many domains to flow-based applications, which include workflows, dataflows, and
control-flows (e.g., event-driven architectures commonly used in streaming), which across various
domains have various degrees of, e.g., complex behavior, large scale, and dynamicity, and thus far do
not allow for a general solution except for the simplest flows. Table 1.3 summarizes the major topics,
innovations, and technical terms.

Addressing the needs of the digital society, application-developers create new applications at a rapid
pace. The Netherlands is well-positioned to contribute and even lead in runtime engines for machine
learning, big data and graph processing, blockchain, online gaming, and other business-critical and
scientific computing workloads. The groups in Amsterdam, Delft, and Leiden are among the global
leaders in FaaS and, more generally, runtime engines for serverless computing research, which aim to
automate runtime engines and commodify them as services for universal use. The groups in
Amsterdam and Leiden are global leaders in runtime engines for data-driven applications. The groups
in Amsterdam, Delft, and Twente have key strategic roles in embedded, IoT, and industrial IoT
research. Sustained investment is needed to expand this core expertise and make it a long-term
driver of growth and digitalization capability for the Dutch society.

1.4 Resource Management

Resource management and scheduling (RM&S) is a key building block for any modern CompSys
technology [13][18], automating most decisions about how to run the workload. RM&S has to ensure
complex non-functional properties (performance, availability, security, energy-efficiency, all others
expressed in the grand societal challenges in the Introduction). To do this, (future) RM&S has to be
powerful, efficient, and self-aware, address both short- and long-term decisions uniformly, make
decisions explainable to engineers, and keep the human in the loop.

Function-as-a-Service

the unprecedented scale, complexity, and dynamicity of

Since the beginning of computer systems in the 1940s, RM&S has played an important role in
managing the ICT infrastructure, in both the long- and the short-term. Initially a part of operations
research and system analysis, the field has produced thousands of iterations over problems such as
facility location (where to place computing hardware and how much, and where to interconnect
facilities and with which networks) and workload scheduling (which part of the workload should run on
which part of the infrastructure, when, and for how long). Hyper-specialized algorithms emerged,
addressing complex optimization problems in offline and online conditions, able to consider multiple
control variables and multiple objectives concurrently. However, the challenges faced so far have been
a tame prelude for
today’s
infrastructure. Workload, services, and resources need to be managed (across networks) to deliver
the more traditional cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and
Software-as-a-Service
and
Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). New and diverse stakeholders pose new challenges, including common
users who want to “plug-and-play”, sophisticated end-users who demand on-demand infrastructure
(e.g., network slicing [49]) subject to complex trade-offs, expert users who deploy business-critical
Infrastructure-as-Code, COOs who want to operate as cost-efficiently as possible and thus demand
elastic scalability, C-level officers who want to reduce operational risk and ensure against disasters;
this leads to complex service level agreements (SLAs) that have become part of automated smart
contracts that, when not fulfilled, trigger tangible and intangible penalties. Workloads need to combine
scientific and engineering computing, with big data and AI/ML, and with network, web, and streaming
capabilities (possibly real-time), all at various granularities, now commonly serviced by the same
operator or even the same facility. The modern data center needs to operate a complex set of often
thousands of support services, and combine heterogeneous hardware for both general-purpose and
specialized computation, communication, and data. Data centers are disaggregated for security,
fairness, and other purposes, but re-aggregated for performance, scalability, and yet other functional
and non-functional objectives, and both as local and geo-distributed infrastructure; this poses new
trade-offs. Fine-grained workload and resource management are now needed for serverless
computing; containerized operations using Docker or Singularity, operating in Kubernetes-managed
pods, complement traditional RM&S approaches based on Condor, Slurm, and Mesos. Already, cloud
deployment needs to support complex models, including hybrid clouds, dynamic cloud bursting, and
even full
infrastructure federation. There are many complex emerging phenomena, such as
performance interference and correlated failures, about which we know remarkably little; we should

18

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

expect to discover more in the next decade. An increasingly stringent demand needs to be combined
with all others: sustainability, including energy consumption (which must be minimized) but also
energy production (with low CO2- and GHG-emissions, linked to renewable production and other
energy transition drivers) or “follow-the-sun” types of RM&S. Already, to take and enact their
decisions, RM&S systems consume about 5% of the infrastructure resources [23].

The main challenge is grand: To enable a new class of RM&S techniques, self-aware and
able to co-exist without human interference, yet remaining under human control and
becoming able to explain their decisions to ICT engineers. Fundamental research challenges
here include: (1) extend the RM&S system to its full complement of decision-making and -taking, both
short- and long-term, and end-to-end, (2) enable powerful RM&S systems, based on artificial
intelligence and simulation, (3) enable diverse feedback and machine learning loops, yet (4) keep the
human in the loop, informed and with well-explained decisions, and (5) operate efficiently. As an
orthogonal issue, (6) experiment with RM&S solutions systematically and comprehensively, preferably
in properly sized real-world environments and/or with accurate simulations. Table 1.4 summarizes the
major topics, innovations, and technical terms.

In the Netherlands we have long-term experience in RM&S,
from operations research to
CompSys-specific techniques. Researchers in every Dutch university have contributed to this field. Key
contributions include all ranges and scales of the problem, from thought-formation on self-awareness
and RM&S in general [13][18], to reference architectures and models for data center scheduling [1], to the
development and tuning of detailed techniques for scheduling [16] and Quality-of-Service routing [25].
Our researchers have fundamental contributions to techniques for short-term RM&S such as
load-balancing, replication, caching, partitioning, consolidation, migration, preemption, offloading,
provisioning, allocation, elastic and auto-scaling, fault-tolerance, admission control, and workload
throttling; and techniques for long-term RM&S such as capacity planning and disaster recovery [40]. An
open research topic is how to fully and flexibly combine these techniques, at all temporal and spatial
granularities, enabling a full complement of decision-making in a unified framework.

Self-awareness involves not only decision-making, but also sensing the reaction of the environment to
the decisions and giving feedback on decisions. A recent proposal (authored by researchers in the
Netherlands) details over 30 tasks related to the decision-making process [1]; another (led by
researchers in the Netherlands), identified 10 classes of self-aware capabilities [21]; and a third
provides a stepping-stone towards self-programming networks [42]. Extending the RM&S capabilities,
powerful techniques are now available, due to much larger data and computation available for RM&S:
for decision-making, artificial
intelligence and computer simulation (in silico experiments); for the
feedback loop: demand estimation, workload prediction, performance prediction, and anomaly
detection, based on hand-crafted or machine learning models. The various parts of the ICT
infrastructure exhibit various degrees of these capabilities and become increasingly programmable and
hence amenable to automatic RM&S; yet, the hundreds to thousands of decision points do not fully
coordinate or may even not cooperate at all. Enabling self-awareness for RM&S, holistically over the
various components, remains a grand challenge,
for which researchers in the Netherlands are
well-positioned to make significant contributions for the next decades.

Two topics have grown significantly in importance and require much more attention than in the past:
the interaction between RM&S systems and their users, and the operational efficiency of RM&S. Both
pose large and largely unaddressed challenges and require immediate attention from researchers. For
example, enabling Infrastructure-as-Code and composable disaggregated infrastructure (CDI) are
important goals that foster advanced usability. Decision-making should become more energy efficient.

1.5 Operating Systems and Foundational Services

Hardware innovation is advancing at a rapid pace, yet most software systems still assume an
outdated, static hardware model. This disparity leads to decreased performance and efficiency, and
also exposes the software to technological obsolescence as new hardware emerges that the
software cannot use. Concurrently, important services, originating mostly in the runtime engine
layer, are becoming common, even foundational services in the computational fabric. For society to
leverage the power of modern hardware, a significant co-design of the operating system and
foundational services (e.g., synchronization, messaging, consistent state management) is needed.

CompSys software has reaped the rewards of Moore’s Law for several decades, building much needed
digital services around CPUs that have grown constantly faster and more efficient. The fundamental
abstractions that operating systems, storage systems, and distributed data processing systems are
based on, however, are still largely inherited and have remained mostly unchanged from the 1980s.
Besides the substantial technical debt they carry, there is also much room for improvement that can
be gained by leveraging modern hardware, such as GPUs, FPGAs, TPUs, ASICs, and NVMe. Emerging
IoT devices also require new, cross-layer hardware and software. To take advantage of these, we need
to rethink the core principles of operating systems, and to co-design system software and
hardware for efficient operation for both single-machine and distributed setups.

In modern computer architectures, the CPU is no longer the dominant element for modern demanding
applications. Instead, we are now facing an increasingly diverse set of supplementary compute
elements that are embedded into peripheral components such as accelerators, storage, network
interface cards, and even memory. Traditional operating systems and foundational services still
formally support these new devices through device drivers but lack the means to deliver their
increasingly powerful capabilities to application developers, due to the lack of meaningful
programming models and APIs. This leads to a sprawling landscape of vendor-proprietary solutions
that all bypass the operating system and thereby undermine the portability of applications; worse,
they lead to vendor lock-in. A prominent example is CUDA, the programming model for Nvidia’s
popular programmable GPUs, which is an irreplaceable component to making machine learning
applications perform and scale.

20

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

The grand challenge for operating systems is to overcome the gap in effective support for
modern hardware. Fundamental challenges here include: (1) re-shaping and re-envisioning how
operating systems are layered and constructed, (2) finding efficient interfaces for applications and
developers to interact with the foundational services, and (3) offering secure and efficient
virtualization and resource sharing for modern hardware devices such as GPUs, FPGAs, and
(programmable) ASICs, which, to date, have limited efficient and secure support for multi-user
operation. Failure to address these challenges will put increasingly out of reach the traditional tasks of
the operating system, i.e., abstraction, resource management, and safety (especially protection). As a
result, it will be increasingly more difficult to develop applications that can operate efficiently on a
variety of different computer systems, to ensure fairness and share resources between multiple
applications running on the same specialized hardware, and to protect the already large attack surface
offered by vendor-proprietary APIs that are impossible for experts to scrutinize and too different to
harden efficiently. Table 1.5 summarizes the major topics, innovations, and technical terms.

where innovation in operating systems happened, e.g.,
Amsterdam.
is surprising how much knowledge and capability exists for this topic in the
Netherlands, relative to the paltry funding made available for this topic. Unfortunately, some of the
talent has started to drain to other countries, such as Germany and the USA. If we fail to act now,
general operating systems, and more specifically knowledge in OS design, hardware, virtualization,
and security, could become a thing of the past.

1.6 Hardware Infrastructure

CompSys infrastructure combines computing, storage, and networking hardware to support the
large variety of modern (online) applications and services we use on a daily basis. The expectation
for computing infrastructure is to continue to grow in capacity, capabilities, and efficiency

21

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

indefinitely, constantly matching the increasing demands of the Dutch economy. To do so, especially
post-Moore’s law, modern infrastructure requires innovation in computing models and architectures,
novel hardware designs, and systems architecture. There are also unique opportunities in
cross-disciplinary research, with material sciences, neuroscience, or optical physics, contributing to
achieving high-performance, highly efficient, and highly customizable CompSys infrastructure.

limited set

From the 1970s through the mid-2000s, the underlying hardware for CompSys infrastructure has
(e.g., general-purpose processing units and proprietary
converged to a rather
fixed-function devices) to facilitate large-scale deployment. Advances were centered around making
these devices faster and more efficient, to achieve higher performance goals; improvements in
CompSys hardware over this period were measured in orders of magnitude every few years, whereas
in other technologies, for example in agriculture and transportation, improvements beyond 40-50% in
a decade were considered remarkable. However, the end of Moore's law makes it increasingly
challenging, and clearly not sustainable, to meet performance expectations using this traditional,
exponential scaling. Thus, new CompSys infrastructure must rely on new paradigms to address
increased programmability and higher diversity. Programmable hardware opens up the
fixed-function boxes and reconsiders the allocation of responsibilities between hardware and software.
It also reduces unnecessary features that otherwise are shipped by default. Higher diversity is
traditionally achieved by specialized hardware and system (co-)design for domain-specific purposes,
but these approaches remain to be validated for the new hardware paradigms that are emerging. In
addition to these design challenges, research in hardware should take into consideration the current
paradigm shift towards open hardware, which was boosted by the success of RISC-V. Furthermore, it
is fundamental to guarantee the possibility to fabricate and test in realistic environments the new
hardware solutions. We predict and already have evidence that the era of one-size fits all is
gone: we need to design and develop efficient, hybrid computer systems by leveraging heterogeneous
computing, networking, and storage devices with different performance, capabilities, and interfaces.
We address each of these kinds of devices,
in turn; Table 1.6 summarizes the major topics,
innovations, and technical terms.

Computing: Processing power is often the flagship feature of computer systems. For many
applications, like simulations in science and smart industry, video processing in digital entertainment,
or massive data processing in training models for personalized healthcare, efficient execution – in
terms of time, throughput, or energy – is crucial. Thus, these diverse and time-consuming applications
have led to the development of new and diverse processing units. Today, computing no longer relies
(only) on CPUs, but rather on a growing collection of heterogeneous hardware devices. For example,
modern CPUs have evolved both in terms of instruction set architecture, with new incarnations of CISC
and RISC solutions, and in terms of hardware organization, evolving from homogeneous
shared-memory multi-core processors (like Intel’s Xeon, AMD’s Opteron, or IBM PowerPC families) to
heterogeneous, hierarchical core organizations (like Cell B.E., Intel’s Xeon Phi. AMD’s Zen, ARM’s
BIG.little, or IBM Power9 families). The memory hierarchy has also seen a diversification of caches and
scratch pad memories, both in terms of organization and technology.

Currently, the fastest, most impactful developments in the computing side of hardware also cover the
realm of accelerators. Including GPUs, TPUs, DPUs, and, more recently, FPGAs, accelerators promise
massive performance improvement (in the order of several TFLOPs) and energy efficiency. New
hardware approaches, including optical neuromorphic computing and optical interconnects, could also
reduce energy consumption and increase speed, but could require rethinking the hardware-software
infrastructure layers. Similarly, in batteryless IoT, energy is harvested from the environment and
therefore of intermittent supply, thus warranting a careful hardware-software design for computing
and communication [54]. Nevertheless, the distributed nature of modern systems, and the tendency of

22

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

sharing hardware resources, calls for novel design methods capable of ensuring the security of the
computation. Programmable hardware, when supported by appropriated tools, offers a great
opportunity to address current and future security requirements.

Finally, hardware design, and the implications of design decisions on the performance and efficiency of
future computer systems, are more open and transparent than ever. Initiatives like Open Compute4
enable users to truly oversee and rethink the core parts of processing units for applications/domains
that require new specialized hardware for unprecedented performance or efficiency.

We foresee that future computer systems will become heterogeneous collections of diverse compute
units [55]. This heterogeneity and the race toward exascale (and beyond [26]) create main challenges in
designing, building, and programming large-scale machines able to match different
applications and user requirements. Exposing and exploiting the specialized features of each of
these accelerators requires well-designed communication and orchestration from both the system CPU
and the system software. Thus, the fundamental scientific challenges to be addressed include: (1)
co-design compute, storage, and networking for sustainable and/or predictable computer systems,
even at exascale and beyond; (2) provide the right abstraction layers for specialized exposure of
processing hardware at different software layers; (3) provide methods and tools for performance and
energy consumption monitoring; (4) design composable performance models for processing units that
enable applications to accurately budget for performance, energy, or utilization, thus reducing
computing waste; and (5) provide tunable mechanisms, where trade-offs like performance vs security
can be balanced in software.

The Netherlands has a strong presence in heterogeneous computing, with groups at TU Delft, UvA, VU
Amsterdam, U. Twente, and TU/e designing specialized processors and accelerators for machine
learning, real-time systems, and/or IoT installations. Large research projects like Efficient Deep
Learning (EDL)5, Energy Autonomous Systems for IoT (Zero)6, and SMART Organ-on-Chip7 feature
hardware design and/or efficient usage, and showcase the proficiency and competency of Dutch
academia to be at the forefront of such developments. We argue that a reduced role in the
international development of hardware is insufficient for sustainable CompSys research in the
Netherlands. Therefore, we need to increase the contribution from the Netherlands in programs like
the European Processor Initiative, where currently only SURF participates from the main Dutch
knowledge landscape. Companies producing hardware, software, and ICT services could gain a more
prominent role, in collaboration with universities and with a stimulus from the Dutch government.

Networking: Since its advent in the 1960s, the Internet has grown from a handful to billions of
nodes. Internet services have expanded from sending email to conducting online business, education,
and entertainment. The Internet is built with a suite of standardized network protocols which allow the
network to be built in a decentralized manner and to scale to large installations. To match growing
network traffic demands, current practice relies on incremental updates: more devices (with higher
capacities) are added. Predominantly, we rely on devices with fixed functions running the protocols.

However, the proliferation of modern online services; the pursuit of higher data-rates, reliability,
scalability, and lower latencies; and the increasing risk of security breaches and unintentional human
error call for a diverse and possibly dynamically changing set of network functionalities, in addition to
simple traffic
forwarding. With fixed-function devices, network functionalities are manually
implemented and wired into the network. This process is tedious and error-prone, when considering

the number and the variety of devices, and their complex dependencies. The fast penetration of 5G
networks and associated brand-new network services indicates such an approach will soon become
unsustainable.

to address

this challenge by introducing more
Software defined networking (SDN) aims
programmability in the network architecture. SDN allows separating control from the data plane, and
using software and possibly artificial intelligence techniques to control the network. This enables, for
example, enhanced orchestration. Also,
the data-plane has seen the emergence of novel
programmable hardware architectures like Protocol Independent Switch Architecture (PISA) and
programmable network devices (e.g., Tofino switches, SmartNICs, NPUs) that can be customized with
programming languages like P4 and NPL.

Broadly speaking, in addition to advancing the physical layers (optical and wireless), and leveraging
technologies like chiplets and silicon photonics to improve the networking stack, the main challenge
for networking hardware is to achieve true programmability and seamless system-level
integration without trading in on speed, thus turning the fixed-function devices running protocols
into a programmable network system where network functionalities can be specified with software on
demand. To achieve this goal, we must address the following scientific challenges: (1) define modern
high-level programming models/abstractions for network devices, contributing to the integrated
development platforms (see Section I.1.3), (2) design and prototype new hardware architectures and
devices, such as programmable photonic network devices and data-plane programmable beyond 5G
type of communications, (3) realize end-to-end programmable and convergent photonic-wireless
networks, (4) propose methods and mechanisms for network configuration synthesis, network
automation, network slicing [49], and intelligent management [4][48] of network resources, and (5)
investigate new security risks and work towards security-by-design for programmable network devices
and (open) technology.

Storage: Storage systems are a critical part of computer systems and services. Historically, disk
capacity and packaging densities have improved rapidly over time, while bandwidths and access
latencies lagged. Since the mid-2000s, we have witnessed the rise of storage based on Non-Volatile
Memory (NVM). NVM storage technologies such as Flash or Optane can nowadays support commodity,
mass-storage computing with up to 10s of GB/s of bandwidth, single digit microseconds of access
latencies, and millions of operations/s, rivaling DRAM speeds. These innovations represent a
fundamental shift in the computing hardware and storage architecture, towards the development of a
unified memory and storage technology. Not only has the performance improved significantly, but the
devices themselves have gained capabilities to support multiple higher-level software features such as
programmability, scheduling, virtualization, security, and efficient data management.

Looking forward, the grand challenge in storage systems is to combine heterogeneous storage
layers, leveraging their programmability and capabilities to deliver a new class of cost,
data, and performance efficiency for all kinds of applications. This requires rethinking the entire
storage hierarchy, from hardware to applications and services, to design hybrid, flexible, and active
storage services, which further enable hardware/software co-design. The fundamental research
challenges to reach this goal are: (1) re-designing storage APIs and abstractions to efficiently
leverage storage device heterogeneity and programmability, (2) co-designing processing units for
seamless integration with different layers of storage, (3) integrating storage with the network, aiming
towards a unified storage-memory-compute and computation-in-memory(-stack) model, (4)
co-designing mechanism for multi-tenant secure storage systems through resource isolation, (5)
investigating emerging storage technologies (e.g., DNA, glass storage, and carbon nanotubes).

1.7 System-wide Qualities, e.g., Performance, Availability, Energy-efficiency,
Privacy, Trust, and Security

Modern computer systems need to work well, which poses necessary compromises (trade-offs)
between performance, availability, energy consumption, privacy,
trust, security, and other
non-functional requirements. Among all scientific and technical communities, the computer systems
and networking community has the unique capability to address the fundamental challenges in
expressing, optimizing, and explaining these 21st-century trade-offs. This is because these aspects
need to be addressed systematically and holistically.

Users demand increasingly more from modern computer systems and networks: it is no longer
sufficient for an application to simply work; how well it works, where it is executing, or how well it
protects each user’s data are requirements that cannot be ignored anymore. These and other
non-functional requirements impact the design, development, and deployment of computer systems.
Experience shows that such non-functional requirements are often interdependent, in what we call
trade-offs – such as application speed vs. energy consumption. Trade-offs dictate the way we build
and use computer systems today but will continue to affect society well into the future, because the
ICT infrastructure has real physical presence and climate impact.

With increased digitalization, systems and applications have become significantly more complex, and,
therefore, more complex trade-offs emerge; users are increasingly expecting that applications are
simultaneously responsive, accurate, and available, governments are starting to become aware of the
need to limit the climate footprint incurred by ICT infrastructure,
industry demands that ICT
operations are secure and resistant to attacks from outside the national borders, and society is
beginning to demand that ICT infrastructure is trustworthy, privacy-preserving, and usable for all. Not
enough understanding exists about these novel needs and related trade-offs. Consequently, no current
approach can robustly optimize for all these aspects.

25

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

Novel components and design methodologies are needed, in particular, for security. Weaknesses and
attacks that exploit information leakage (such as physical attacks or microarchitectural side-channel
attacks) have demonstrated that system security can be achieved only if it is considered since the
beginning of the whole design phase, and it is tackled holistically. Current approaches that often
consider security only at the last stages of the design must thus be replaced by methods to construct
systems that are secure and privacy preserving by design. And while security is a conditio sine qua
non for trust, it is not the only aspect. Trust also relates to transparency and control – can users know
and exert control over how their data are handled – reliability, and more.

The grand challenge here is to make system-wide qualities easy to observe, reason about,
and manage optimally. Fundamental research challenges here include: (1) holistic support for
expressing, optimizing, and explaining different trade-offs, including through real-time, digital twins of
infrastructure; (2) enabling Operational Data Analytics (ODA) [33] across the entire ICT
critical
infrastructure; (3) security-, trust-, and privacy-aware computing and communications (by design);
(4) processes and tools to support a transition to energy- and climate-aware ICT infrastructure; (5)
FAIR data and open-source software [32] for responsible science and societal access to knowledge and
decision-making in this field; and (6) processes and tools to explain these trade-offs to all societal
stakeholders. Table 1.7 summarizes the major topics, innovations, and technical terms.

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

The Netherlands is well-positioned in this area. Research groups across the country have focused on
complex optimization across various trade-offs and diverse classes of ICT infrastructure. Research
groups in Amsterdam and Delft have pioneered empirical research methods to collect and analyze
ODA data for various classes of ICT infrastructure, and are global leaders in this field. Amsterdam,
Delft, Nijmegen, and Twente host world-class researchers in cybersecurity, trust, and privacy,
pioneering aspects related to digital
independence and Internet security for the past decade and
currently working together to realize the responsible internet [13], that is, a vision for an internet
that harbors users’ privacy and enables enhanced transparency and control, by leveraging open and
programmable network technology. Research groups in Amsterdam, Delft, and Twente are actively
developing processes and tools related to energy and climate; and are aligned with the emerging LEAP
leadership-class alliance in the Netherlands. Aligned with the leadership role played by the
Netherlands in establishing the FAIR principles [32], a cluster of high-quality researchers, located in
Amsterdam, Delft, Leiden, and Twente, has collected and shared FAIR data and open-source software
related to system-wide qualities, for over a decade.

These strengths of the Dutch research community in this area are real, but to keep up the field
requires immediate investment on par with the benefits society derives from ICT infrastructure,
similarly to the large growth fund (Groeifonds) investments made recently in other digitalization
processes, e.g., in AI algorithms and systems. We are still at the moment when we can address the
grand challenge, before the construction of too many hyperscale data centers and related ICT
infrastructure, and before the security and energy-consumption flaws become too large. Failure to do
so will mean outsourcing optimization and losing sovereignty over the results, further eroding our
(digital) independence. More subtly, failure to do so will impose tough choices on future generations:
live with indispensable ICT infrastructure that is not fit to address 21st century challenges and that
exposes society to large risks, or a costly rebuild after enormous expensive infrastructure has already
been deployed.

2. Cross-Disciplinary Translational CompSys Research

Multi- and interdisciplinary research, in short, cross-disciplinary research, runs the risk that the
CompSys component of this research is used only for its applied research value, thus both limiting its
potential contribution to the development of the other sciences involved in the process and diminishing
its ability to learn back from these other sciences. Instead, we advocate for cross-disciplinary
translational research in CompSys, with three core pillars: (1) experimental work focusing on grand
experiments and on the ability to “break” seemingly working CompSys artifacts under very specific
conditions; (2) experimental work focusing on use cases, proofs of concept, and pilot trials that help
understand and cross-pollinate with the needs of another discipline; and (3) co-design processes and
best-practices in collaboration with professionals from other disciplines, aimed to promote and enable
digitalization through CompSys technologies.

The main difference between translational research in CompSys and the current applied research is
that translational research uses bi-directional exchange of knowledge and best-practices. We are
inspired in this approach by recent advances in translational research in computer science [30], which
are in turn inspired by the biomedical field; translational medicine aims to “combine disciplines,
resources, expertise, and techniques within these pillars to promote enhancements in prevention,
diagnosis, and therapies” [30]. This applies across all Technological Readiness Levels (TRLs) used by
EU-level projects.

2.1. Simplicity, Composability, and Maintainability

Digitalization is not possible without taming the complexity of computer systems and networks, by
prioritizing simplicity, composability, and maintainability. These aspects need to be considered with a
cross-disciplinary perspective, where CompSys plays a prominent
role alongside AI, and
contributions from experts in law and regulation, policy making, economic ecosystems, ethics, and
processes involving the general population (e.g., through GovTech).

A study by ENISA regarding Telecom Security Incidents 2020 [8] reveals that the vast majority of
telecommunications incidents are not caused by malicious actions, but rather by system failures and
human error. These are clearly CompSys aspects and point to the need to tame the ever-growing
complexity in computer systems and networks8. Particularly the use of AI techniques may aid
operators in controlling these ecosystems; the nascent AIops field aims to combine CompSys and AI
techniques to enable this.

As Turing Award winner9 Edsger W. Dijkstra put
it, “Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability”.
Unfortunately, partly due to their success, computer systems and networks are becoming more
complex by the day. For example, when we look at networks (but the same trend applies for CompSys
in general), it is not only the sheer size of networks, but also the diversity of protocols and algorithms
that exist to govern how our data traffic is routed. And the specifications of some of those protocols
can span hundreds of pages. Moreover, each router vendor is using its own vendor-specific language,
which must be mastered to configure the protocols. And given that there are many protocols, each
with many configuration settings, we end up with near-infinite configuration possibilities. This
complexity, as indicated by Dijkstra’s quote, is the reason why misconfigurations are one of the main
causes of network outages. This complexity also stands in the way of the Dutch and European pursuit
of digital sovereignty. Much of today's telecommunications operations are outsourced to non-European

8 Other fields have had to overcome the complexity gap while delivering real-time decision-making and control,
e.g., aircraft piloting for passenger, freight, military, and other applications. Solutions in these fields are never
one-size-fits-all, but nuance and holistic approaches for specific purposes.
9 The Turing Award is the computer-science equivalent of the Nobel prize.

28

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

countries. To regain control is not only a matter of cost, but also requires sufficient in-house expertise
and personnel.

Partly due to the aforementioned complexity, often an approach is adopted where certain building
blocks of the CompSys ecosystem (like protocols) are designed in isolation. As a result, when deployed
“in the wild” alongside other protocols and algorithms, undesirable effects, such as unfair resource
utilization or high-performance variability, do manifest [47][51]. To avoid such undesirable effects, a
holistic approach to monitoring and configuration is needed, but this is simply too complex to do by
hand. In other words, the operator would benefit from a higher degree of automation, verification, and
possibly auto-completion of configurations in computer systems and networks [42][43], which in turn
requires new research. Similar research is also actively pursued in the software engineering
community. For example, in June 2021, GitHub announced copilot, which uses AI to help programmers
write better code.

These technical aspects need to be complemented by cross-disciplinary translational research with
experts in law and regulation, policy making, economic ecosystems, ethics, processes involving the
general population, etc. GovTech is an emerging (and already lucrative) area [34] aiming to provide
socio-technical solutions for digitalized processes and digital interaction in the public sector, typically
developed and delivered through public-private partnership. The main cross-disciplinary challenge
is to protect public values such as social
inclusiveness especially regarding access to
CompSys-mediated technology for the elderly, new immigrants, and other social categories that may
have trouble with the complexity of digitalization; support for expected values including privacy and
tolerance; reduction of bureaucracy, corruption, and general stress of administration through
CompSys-mediated solutions that “just work”; ability to combat fraud and other digital threats, and
more generally to defend the principles of security, through CompSys-mediated processes; etc.
Together, these are necessary components of any working democracy.

2.2. Responsibility, Trust, and Security

Even if accomplished technically, digitalization must enable long-term activities based on
responsible, trustworthy, and secure processes. CompSys experts should therefore engage with
these topics, in collaboration with experts from related fields. Responsibility, trust, and security are
cross-borders, so the Netherlands should collaborate on the European level and beyond.

The recent ransomware hack of a major US oil pipeline [11] is unfortunately but one example of how
disruptive computer and network outages can be to society. It is evident that we should protect
society against such disruptions, which calls not only for embedding security by design, a grand
challenge on its own, but also enabling aspects like transparency (can we know how our data
is routed and processed?), digital sovereignty (can we have control over it?), and responsibility
(who is accountable?).

Our computer and network systems have become too big and important to fail, yet they frequently do
(for various, including malicious, reasons). It is also the case that, in key areas such as governance
and education, the Netherlands is one of the large consumers of cloud services hosted by cloud
operators whose headquarters are not in the Netherlands or even in Europe, much more so than other
countries in Europe [10]. Both aspects relate to trustworthiness, i.e., do we trust the system to
consistently provide the services we need, and do we trust that our precious data are not misused by
the companies offering those services. Especially when those companies are based outside of Europe,
our digital sovereignty is at stake, which leads us to the following challenge: how to extend the
original set of design goals for (our own) computer and network systems with concepts like robustness
against side channel attacks and security-by-design, transparency, reliability, trustworthiness, etc.,

29

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

and to enable verifiable insights into and control over the operation of those systems? Furthermore,
certain computation could be carried out without the actual need of sharing, at least directly, the data.
However, the practical use of these constructions is currently impossible, because they can require too
much computational effort. Many of the design goals, e.g., for the Internet area, are open problems
since decades, so to add the aforementioned design principles, research is needed into: (1) novel
metrics and measurements to assess/verify the state of the systems and the privacy of the data used
in the computation, (2) mechanisms to balance transparency and security objectives, (3) new
hardware paradigms, including (open) programmable hardware, or radically new approaches to use
existing ones, to effectuate near-instantaneous control, (4) languages for expressing trust and
sovereignty requirements, etc. and end-to-end over all compute, storage, and network resources
used, (5) novel approaches that allow to ensure trust and to track the flow of information in a practical
settings, (6) approaches for carrying out computation while maintaining the privacy of the data (such
as homomorphic encryption) and their trade-offs with other (non-functional) goals.

On a European scale, the Gaia-X project aims to develop a data infrastructure based on such values of
openness, transparency, and trust. The Gaia-X project focuses mostly on providing cloud services and
less on making the network itself also more transparent. This is where the recently launched Dutch
project Controllable, Accountable, Transparent: the Responsible Internet (CATRIN) comes in. CATRIN
proposes two network planes: (1) The Network Inspection Plane (NIP), which makes transparent to
users which network operators (e.g., ISPs or DNS and cloud providers) handle their data flows, and
whether those actors align with the users’ principles. (2) The Network Control Plane (NCP), which,
based on insights gained from the NIP, empowers users to have a say in how the Internet
infrastructure should handle their data.

Similarly to Section 2.1, the link with GovTech is strong, posing cross-disciplinary challenges in
(1) technological transparency for CompSys and CompSys-mediated solutions, which increases trust
in governance and GovTech in general; (2) trust-enabling technology including in the CompSys layers,
with additional trade-offs between privacy and law-enforcement capabilities, and further ethical and
societal discussion; (3) efficiency of secure solutions, which should be measured at least against
CompSys performance, scalability, and energy consumption; etc. This way, we can ensure that the
people of the Netherlands have the right to use ICT, to learn how to use it, and to understand their
own use as it happens [18].

2.3. Energy Efficiency, Climate Responsibility, and Sustainability

To tackle globe climate and environment-related challenges, the EU has set the goal of achieving no
net emission of greenhouse gasses in 2050 and decoupling the economic growth from resource use
[9]. As a major energy consumer, the ICT domain shares this
in the European Green Deal
responsibility and requires a deep reform towards energy awareness to meet this goal. This includes
both coming up with more energy-efficient designs for computer and network systems and
algorithms, and involving more renewable energy sources in provisioning ICT infrastructures.

Our living environment is surrounded by computing technologies, from small, embedded sensors on
our home appliances to mega data centers powering up sophisticated online services. Yet, all these
technologies require electricity to function. As suggested by a 2020 meta-analysis of available data [35],
ICT infrastructure accounts for more than 2% of global electricity consumption; in the Netherlands,
CBS reports [35] an even higher fraction, of 2.6% in 2019, but growth since 2017 is faster than
elsewhere [35]. With the rapid rollout of 5G networks and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), the number of
computing and networking devices keeps growing drastically [3]. As a result, drastically reducing the
energy consumption of cellular communications is one of the main pillars of the vision for 6G.
Meanwhile, the ever-increasing data volume together with the fast penetration of artificial intelligence

30

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

intensity on these
in various industries and business domains have increased the computational
devices to an unprecedented level [3]. The digitalization of our modern society will keep pushing these
trends. At this pace, it is predicted that by 2025, the ICT sector will consume over 20% of the entire
world’s electricity [35] ; in the Netherlands, the total electricity consumption will become larger by a
factor of 2 up to 7 by 2030 [35], over the 2019 consumption of 2.7 TWh [35].

Overall, we are facing the following grand challenge: How to make our computer and network
infrastructures energy-efficient and environment-friendly, while sustaining the continuous
growth? Fundamental research challenges associated with this grand change are: (1) new hardware
technologies that can provide similar performance and capabilities, but with much reduced power
consumption, (2) new computing models and architectures (e.g., neuromorphic computing) that can
perform computations more efficiently, (3) energy-efficient system designs and software for runtime
systems and resource management, (4) hardware-software co-design with built-in energy efficiency,
and (5) integration of renewable energy in computing and networking infrastructures, and harvesting
energy from the environment to power batteryless IoT devices, to make them truly energy- and
climate-aware, and thus sustainable. An alternative to using less energy for the same work
(challenges 1-4) and to using greener energy for the same work (challenge 5) is to do less work
altogether: (6) finding technical and societal approaches that lead to reducing the amount of work -
for example, caching and using approximate computing, and incentivizing professionals to skip
running the least useful workloads, respectively.

The Netherlands has a long history of using renewable energy and is well positioned to address the
above challenges. In particular, the Dutch government has put tremendous effort into energy-efficient
ICT with initiatives like the GreenICT foundation, SDG Nederland, and Green IT Amsterdam. A special
focus on data centers has been put, since data centers have been the backbone of our digital society
and the Netherlands has a strong and mature economy around data centers. On the research frontier,
the NWO-funded Perspectief projects like ZERO and EDL have been tackling the energy-related
challenges in systems for IoT and deep learning, respectively, which are among the most important
application domains today.

2.4. Digitalization in the Netherlands and aligned with the EU

The transition to digital processes is happening in all key sectors of the Dutch economy and is a key
goal of the Government of the Netherlands. CompSys is a cornerstone of this transition, and
through translational CompSys research in collaboration with experts from each sector (and
application domain) the transition will continue successfully. CompSys can help harmonize national
needs and European Union goals and policies, both economic and societal.

The grand challenge for digitalization in the Netherlands is that technology and processes
must be tailored to the national needs. Challenges include: (1) translational CompSys research to
support the digital transition; (2) translational CompSys research to provide digital data and service
marketplaces (linked to Sections 2.1-2.3); (3) translational CompSys research to provide specialized
support for industry verticals, e.g., for smart industry, intelligent healthcare, a digital energy sector,
energy transition through ICT means, smart mobility and logistics, digital remote work, digital twins,
digital entertainment and online gaming, digital government, digital education, digital culture,
GovTech, FinTech, smart agriculture, democratized and citizen science, the Fourth Paradigm of Science
(big science), Quantum computing, and other domains.

A further grand challenge derives from the geo-political situation of the Netherlands: CompSys in
the Netherlands must align and integrate with the EU technology platforms, and help meet
the economic and societal goals of the EU. Challenges and opportunities derive from the

31

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

alignment with and integration into the EU strategy, specifically, (1) digitalization in general: EU single
digital market; (2) CompSys technology in general: the EU related strategy for green and digital
technology, EuroHPC, the future 5G Toolbox for wireless communication in Europe, and the future
European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and Gaia-X; (3) focus on trust, privacy, and security: New EU
Cybersecurity Strategy, EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); (4) specific domains: New
Industrial Strategy, Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe, Europe's Beating Cancer Plan; (5) climate
change: European Green Deal; (6) focus on science: European Research Area, including Horizon
Europe; (7) focus on the assessment framework: EU Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI).

The community has built several research infrastructures to test their theoretical constructs and
practical prototypes, especially in Amsterdam and Delft, and in collaboration with organizations such
as Deltares and governance, or through fieldlabs such as the Do IoT fieldlab10 in Delft, etc., but more
investment is needed to acquire the large-scale infrastructure needed for proof-of-concept tests and
grand experimentation.

3. Priorities in Research-Inspired Education in CompSys

We highlight the need for IT professionals with core CompSys expertise, coming from all backgrounds
and including currently under-represented groups in the field. We need to further consider societal and
peopleware [18] problems in largely CompSys-oriented courses, and train students from all walks of life
to recognize CompSys-related problems. Challenges in education also include didactic elements:
because computer systems courses are both broad and deep, we need to help our students engage
and stay motivated, and give them exploration tools to put theory to practice e.g., [27].

3.1. Teach Computer Systems Thinking in All Relevant Curricula

Currently, advances in most science, technology, and information studies rely heavily on computing
and networking. As such, computer systems are ubiquitous in each of these fields, but often
invisible to users. This lack of awareness and understanding of computer systems leads to their
inefficient use in terms of performance, security, and interoperability; more subtly, users should
develop an intuition about computer systems. To eradicate such problems, all curricula in these
studies should include computer systems knowledge to some degree, ranging from basic to
advanced according to need. It is only with such knowledge that true systems thinking can be
taught and applied in modern science and technology, and in society at large.

A digitalised society relies heavily on computing and network infrastructure and services. To further
advance and even accelerate the development of the Dutch digitalised society, the next generation of
users, developers, designers, and integrators must be aware of the role of computer systems in all
these aspects of our lives. To raise this awareness, several aspects of the education curricula at
different levels must be adjusted to include age-appropriate and skill-appropriate notions from
computer systems. Failure to adapt the curricula to include such notions will have profound negative
effects in terms of using, designing, and building digital applications and services. In contrast,
successful integration will likely attract more and diverse specialists in a domain that often struggles to
recruit home-grown talent. Importantly, but more subtly, both specialists and the general public
should develop an intuition about what computer systems can do and how they can do it, especially
regarding efficient, sustainable, and secure computation and communications; this is much like how
scientists and engineers have to develop an intuition about statistics or analytical modeling.

Current education curricula shy away from topics related to computer systems, which are perceived as
(overly) technical. Thus, computer systems challenges and opportunities become invisible for our next
generation of students, specialists, and scientists. This process must be reversed, or we risk
outsourcing a lot of our digital services to companies elsewhere, thus losing governance and control
over these services. Already today the demand from companies for (local) CompSys personnel
surpasses the availability.

We advocate for a unified effort to support computer systems modules in relevant curricula at
all education levels. Integrating computer systems in all relevant curricula, nation-wide, requires
defining several levels of proficiency, from basic to expert. Concretely, we propose the development of
the following modules: (1) basic computer systems literacy for everyone in a digitalised society,
(2) fundamentals of computer systems functionality for students in scientific domains,
(3) fundamental principles and operational skills for students at universities of applied sciences, and
(4) basic design, fundamental principles, and operational skills for students of technical universities
and computer-science or related fields. (We address experimental CompSys topics in Section 3.2,
‘Teach Performance and [...] Experimental Research in CompSys’.)

33

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

Additionally, we believe that enabling a digitalised society in which no one is left behind requires
strong support for national programs for life-long learning through training. Computer systems
literacy and knowledge at different levels (basic, proficient, advanced, and expert) can and should be
facilitated through dedicated learning modules and activities. The computer systems community can
design and maintain such educational learning modules, with the logistic and financial support from
universities and governing bodies, such as the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science (MinOCW).

From a didactical perspective, CompSys also presents a diverse palette of opportunities to hone
specific skills in computer systems thinking, from theory to experimentation. These include, for
example: (1) project-based education, where students could develop their research skills by going
through a complete research cycle, from the formulation of a research question, to generating and
analyzing the results, to reporting about it; (2) the use of (social) gamification in education, where
aspects from (online) gaming are introduced in complex courses, e.g., on distributed computing
systems [22], to boost student engagement; and (3) Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCS) and other
forms of online learning (much used during the COVID-19 pandemic), where the field of CompSys
itself also directly enriched the way we teach.

3.2. Teach Performance and Other Non-Functional Aspects, Benchmarking, and
Empirical and Experimental Research in CompSys

Consumers of digital applications and services primarily are often perceived as caring only about
application functionality. However, non-functional properties – like execution speed, efficiency,
energy consumption, reliability, security – are becoming equally important, due to their significant
impact on the overall sustainability of and trust in our digital economy. All creators of digital content
must be aware of these non-functional properties and should assume an active role in overall efforts
to build more sustainable systems. This starts with their education: all education targeting digital
content creation must contribute to raising awareness and improving the state-of-the-art in terms of
non-functional properties
for applications and services. Hands-on practice, on realistic
infrastructure, can play an important role in forming intuitions about real issues.

Designing applications often starts from functional requirements: a definition of what the application
must or should do. However, in current design and development processes, additional (and often,
much stricter) requirements dictate how an application must perform its tasks. These non-functional
requirements often refer to minimizing execution speed or energy consumption, or maximizing the
efficiency in utilizing resources or security, and contribute to the overall sustainability of a digitalised
society. Ignoring such requirements often becomes problematic only at deployment time, when, for
example, a neural network training or a digital twin simulation become too slow to handle; worse,
some of these requirements, such as the amount of electricity consumed by the application, are not
even visible to the user. Thus, these problems are often (wrongly) associated with and blamed on
computer systems, and the solution is, invariably, to buy or build bigger systems – for example, buy a
larger machine or a faster network. In turn, this often leads to poor resource utilization11 and a
significant setback in efforts to increase the sustainability of ICT.

We argue instead that the problem is the lack of awareness about non-functional properties:
what their impact is, how they can be measured and monitored, and how to account for them in digital
content creation,
from scientific simulations to visualization tools, and from games to financial
calculations. Thus, all higher-education curricula where digital content creation is part of the exit
qualifications and/or skills share the responsibility of raising awareness about these non-functional
properties.

11 Historically, server utilization has been below 15%. Many modern clouds have not increased this value beyond
50%. In contrast, well-managed infrastructure uses over 90% of its resources.

34

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

To this end, we propose to design dedicated teaching modules for (1) introducing the basic
concepts behind non-functional properties of applications and computer systems, and (2) showcasing
empirical
research methods and tools for monitoring these non-functional properties in real
applications and systems. Teaching the fundamental concepts will facilitate, for future domain experts,
“what operations should be
the transition from considering mainly functional aspects (i.e.,
performed?”) to a grounded attitude, where applications and systems are to be understood also
non-functionally (i.e., “how well are the operations performed, and at what cost?”). Teaching empirical
methods and tools will facilitate the transition from thinking in terms of predictive theory to the reality
that, at realistic levels of complexity, most systems act very differently from expectation. We envision
such modules being designed and developed together with domain specialists (scientists, AI experts,
simulation experts), and diversified to target different academic levels: BSc, MSc, and PhD students of
applied science, technical, and general universities.

A type of experimentation very common in professional CompSys is benchmarking, which allows
comparing multiple approaches with standardized, reproducible procedures. Teaching and training
using benchmarks could develop important intuitions and help deepen the material, and emphasize
this type of education also requires adequate
the importance of
experimental infrastructure and instrumentation, which for CompSys purposes can be expensive
in comparison with typical laboratory equipment needed for computer science. Fieldlabs, in addition to
serving as a place for research and innovation, may also serve as one vehicle to unlock realistic
infrastructure for students and professionals.

reproducibility. However,

3.3. Teach Co-creation with Other Domains

With computing at the core of research and development in many domains, all key sectors of the
Dutch economy, and all routes highlighted by the NWA (“nationale wetenschapsagenda”), it is easy
to assume a producer-consumer relationship, where CompSys provides the computational power
and tools to be used by other domains. This approach fundamentally limits the pace of progress and
development
Instead, we advocate
cross-disciplinary research, where both domain and computer scientists collaborate to co-design
effective solutions, and where feedback is returned to all sciences involved. To enable this paradigm
shift, tools and methods for this new kind of research must be taught at MSc and PhD level.

in both the consumer and the producer domains.

Virtually all scientific discoveries in the past decade have relied on computing and, by extension, on
computer systems. For example, advances in radio astronomy, genome sequencing, natural language
processing, and automated translation have all relied on smart algorithms running on increasingly
powerful computer systems. Nobel and Spinoza prize winners can easily point to the CompSys
infrastructure they relied on and, notably, include CompSys experts in their award-winning thanks.
Similarly, the industry relies on computing and networking in a wide range of domains, from financial
calculation to product simulations to sensing and control in smart industry settings. Emerging domains
with bright economic and societal future, such as AI, GovTech, quantum computing, rely on CompSys
expertise; for example, quantum computing currently relies on traditional computer systems to
simulate its revolutionary techniques and algorithms and on classical networks to set up the
entanglement for the quantum internet [24].

Traditionally, computer systems are seen as the infrastructure that supports the idea, and not as a
part of the idea itself. In effect, this means a disjoint development of these applications from computer
systems, where domain experts and CompSys experts interact in a producer-consumer relationship.
Such a disjoint approach has two major drawbacks: (1) it slows down development in both areas, as
alignment of requirements and solutions is often expensive in both time and resources, and (2) it
cancels the premise of cross-disciplinary research that could lead to truly innovative, effective, and
efficient research instruments dedicated to the task at hand. The latter is more subtle, but a common

35

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

situation is currently that scientists from an emerging domain lose an early start, because they cannot
envision what CompSys infrastructure could do with envisionable developments, and CompSys
scientists and technicians take a long period of time before they can help, because they do not
understand where the science aims to go and what are its challenges.

To avoid these drawbacks, we posit it is essential to teach cross-disciplinary translational
research in all fields, including CompSys – CompSys science and other domains are intertwined
and should not be separated. In this way, effective co-design approaches and methods can emerge,
ultimately fostering an effective collaboration between all interested stakeholders. Such an ambitious
goal
is not without challenges: (1) devising a cross-disciplinary translational research education
program that is widely accepted in different domains, including CompSys, relies on widespread literacy
in CompSys concepts and research methods, and (2) establishing cooperation and support from
diverse academic and research bodies, including investment in pilots for designing and/or improving
methods and tools for co-designing effective and efficient research instruments, and obtaining buy-in
and commitment from university staff and students, to embrace such a curriculum.

3.4. Teach about ICT-Related Societal Problems for a Healthy Society

The rapid increase in connected devices per person (estimated at 4 to 6 per person by 2023 [3]) is
illustrative of the massive impact and opportunities for CompSys worldwide. However, these
opportunities come at a steep price, including enormous energy consumption, security crises,
information leaks or censorship, and ethically questionable data-analysis. We must ensure our
education curricula openly present and discuss these challenges, and monitor the approaches and
solutions. In turn, this will open a clear path towards a healthier digital society.

Although with great benefits, such as to vaccine design and development, or to understanding and
mitigating climate change, CompSys does not come cheap: energy consumption for all our devices,
from personal and IoT devices to supercomputers and data centers, is steadily increasing. The impact
of this growth on the energy and other resources of the world, and, consequently, on climate change
and further on the long-term sustainability of humankind, can no longer be ignored.

Moreover, the countless opportunities for CompSys research and applications have led to an explosion
of systems and tools that are, very often, open to the entire world. Together with the massive
amounts of data generated by all of us online, and through networks the accessibility of compute
resources in cloud installations, these applications and systems can be easily abused (maliciously or
through lack of awareness). For example, open-source frameworks and just a couple of remote
compute nodes enable almost everyone to train a massive neural network to recognize faces in the
crowd or to generate deep-fakes. Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks can be executed at the click of
a button, by simply purchasing them on the dark web. Social networks, with all their benefits and
challenges, are enabled by CompSys ecosystems. And in particular in the area of online gaming and
online social media, toxic behavior has been growing along with the popularity of CompSys devices.
And while clear toxic behavior should be mitigated, there are also plenty of examples where
censorship is misused to oppress. These are but few examples to indicate that ethical, legal, and
regulatory aspects need to be addressed as well, next to the technical challenges raised by ICT
infrastructure and services.

All these issues can pose significant threats to our well-being as individuals and in society. Therefore,
the CompSys community must openly discuss these challenges and rally behind the
common goal of contributing solutions to these challenges. For it to have an impact, this
discussion must include the next generations of CompSys experts and users. We argue therefore that
all the aspects related to the socio-economic impact of CompSys, from reproducible to comparable
quantitative information, from sustainability to security, and from ethics to economics and law, must

36

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

be included in all relevant curricula, at academic level. To this end, however, a concerted effort is
needed to build and maintain a credible, fact- and numbers-based analysis of all these threats, their
impact, and potential solutions. Paraphrasing David J.C. MacKay12, we need to discuss “CompSys,
without the hot air”.

3.5. Teach Creative and Design Thinking for Young Specialists

Massive leaps in the development of CompSys often arise, much like in many other domains of
science and technology, from blue-sky, curiosity-driven research, and from the goal to push the
boundaries of current systems beyond their known limits. Therefore, the search for the next
generation of CompSys must rely on young specialists with the knowledge and tools for creative and
design thinking. We advocate that advanced CompSys education must invest adequate time and
resources, and make room for creative and design thinking in the curriculum.

Many great discoveries in CompSys – time-sharing, the PLATO system, the Internet, the multi-core
processor, GPU computing, or the computational ecosystem behind AlphaGo or the CERN Large Hadron
Collider – have started as creative solutions from blue-sky, curiosity-driven research, and resulted in
paradigm shifts. To ensure such discoveries will keep emerging, we must encourage our young
CompSys specialists to think big, but also equip them with the tools and methods for
creative and design thinking.

To reach this goal, we envision specialized education in creative and systems design thinking in
CompSys, with five core principles: (1) teach and challenge the fundamental design principles for
computer and network systems and their evolution in time, (2) provide actual snapshots and
examples of both successes and failures, and emphasize that history is not a long string of successes
but rather an exploration between solutions that often take time to separate, (3) present and discuss
the fundamental challenges, technological and societal, that CompSys had, has, and will still have to
solve, and avoid the simple turn of phrase “this is old technology”, (4) provide evidence of creative,
cross-disciplinary solutions that have led to paradigm shifts in CompSys and beyond, and (5) present
methods, tools, and processes e.g., [19] to facilitate CompSys design, and help the transition from
CompSys design to implementation to realization to operation. These aspects contrast deeply with the
descriptive approaches, and even to the analytical ones, that are commonly taught today.

This vision, however, is not immediately applicable. For example, while the history of CompSys is
increasingly better documented, an open challenge is building (and collectively agreeing upon) the
genealogical trees (more likely, graphs) of the various systems that led to significant paradigm shifts
or to significant failures. A different, yet equally difficult challenge is selecting the short list of inspiring
cross-disciplinary solutions that showcase the process and impact of creative thinking in CompSys;
likely, scientific and networked cloud ecosystems will be a source. Also of great significance is the
challenge of defining and agreeing upon the language and methodology for CompSys design, such that
its separation, especially from implementation and operation can be clearly explained.

As CompSys is a rapidly evolving domain, this content must be maintained and updated. We
recommend this specialist education to start from an online manual, adjusted for the specific
curriculum, to which the CompSys community can constantly contribute, as for example initiated by
the computer networking community [5]. Annual revisions and a lean consortium of research and
education representatives to manage its development could address this issue. Imagine the young
specialists that will create the future, equipped with the right cognitive tools of the day!

12 The seminal book “Sustainable energy, without the hot air”, by the late MacKay, is relevant also for CompSys and
has been made available for free online: https://www.withouthotair.com/.

II. General Priorities and Recommendations

The Netherlands needs a roadmap focusing on investment in CompSys R&D, changing the current
approach of mere (or just late) adoption. Societal stakeholders should value innovation in computer
systems instead of merely with computer systems, in developing cross-disciplinary translational
research in CompSys, and in high-quality education and training coupled with diversity goals. A key
focus of these recommendations is the holistic view on CompSys research; all of it is reinforced by
advances in any of it.

The Netherlands has strong research in computer systems, but more investment and organization is
needed to maximize its strengths and potential, preventing a brain-drain that is already starting.

We make 10 recommendations, focusing on the priorities of CompSys in the Netherlands. Each of
these recommendations is high-reward, and due to mutual reinforcement combined they could lead to
major improvements for the Netherlands. They can lead to pragmatic innovation in CompSys, through
and beyond horizon-2035.

R1. Invest in CompSys research personnel in the Netherlands: a structural
investment of €195 million in people, co-financed over the next 10 years
by Government and industry stakeholders, to deliver its holistic view.

CompSys technology is the cornerstone of the Dutch digital economy and has an outsized impact on
the Dutch economy and society13. For the next 10 years, ICT will have an estimated direct contribution
of over €1 trillion in added value, indirect contribution of over €6 trillion, and will support through
spillover the creation of new sectors related to GovTech, AI, quantum computing, and others.
Moreover, the technology push and societal pull of the 21st-century strongly indicate that current
CompSys technology is about to be replaced with a radically new generation. Early investors will not
only create new goods and services before other advanced economies, but also reap the benefits and
establish themselves as mediators in the global digital economy.

We recommend that investment in CompSys research in the Netherlands becomes proportional with
the operational cost of ICT infrastructure, and linked with the impact it provides on the economy. The
Ministries of Economic Affairs and Climate (EZK), Internal Affairs (BZK), and Justice and Security
(J&V), have important interests related to this field [37] and thus should play a direct role in developing
CompSys research in the Netherlands. Their Nederlandse Digitaliseringsstrategie 2018-2021 is a good
step in the right direction, but significant investments in CompSys research are still to appear.

Our pragmatic recommendation is to invest and fund over the next decade in the order of
500 PhD students, and academic experts and support staff to help coordinate and develop
these new experts. This would make the program similar to, for example, the large investment in
Sweden in AI systems, and the estimated final investment in the Dutch equivalent groeifondsproject
NedAI. The main technical outcome of this investment is a proof-of-concept CompSys platform that
takes a holistic view of the challenges and opportunities at every level in the technology stack that we
envision as the economic workhorse of the Netherlands in 2035-2040; in other words, we will leverage
all the advantages offered by the current generation of academic experts in the Netherlands, as
described in Section 1, ‘Priorities in Foundational CompSys Research’. The economy able to absorb and

leverage this expertise already exists; however, a structural investment in it, for example through the
Groeifondsprogramma, could deliver the very positive scenario in which the Netherlands will
maintain the attractiveness of its global data-port through 2035 and beyond (akin to the
physical Rotterdamse Haven and Schiphol Luchthaven), and will bootstrap an unmatched,
high-quality digital ecosystem around it, with Dutch and EU policies and goals.

This significant investment in personnel should be matched by proportional
experimental infrastructure and in a network of excellence, see next recommendations.

R2. Establish and maintain a coalition for CompSys, through a direct
investment of €15 million over the next 10 years.

The complexity and diversity of CompSys ecosystems makes it an area of research that is addressed
by researchers from various disciplines (see Section I.2, `Cross-Disciplinary Translational CompSys
Research’). Guaranteeing well-performing CompSys technology thus warrants that those researchers
unite and collaborate towards shaping the future of computer systems and networks. Within the
Netherlands, we have provided a platform for doing this through the newly established Special
Interest Group (SIG), on “Future Computer and Network Systems,” of the ICT-research Platform
Netherlands. Presently, this SIG has representatives from most Dutch universities, and its focus is
primarily on research and education related to CompSys.

The long-term goal of this SIG, and a recommendation from this manifesto, is to establish a larger
CompSys coalition, of which the IPN SIG would be a part, but which also has members from
industry and government. Given the importance of responsible digitalization, such a collaboration in
triple-helix format is needed to assure that (1) the right research problems are addressed, (2) results
are more easily adopted in practice, and (3) relevant governance aspects are developed concurrently.
This could be extended to directly include representatives of the Dutch public, e.g., through
citizen-scientists, and through NGOs interested in the societal and climate impact of CompSys.

To achieve these goals, the coalition needs to bring together and coordinate all parties covering the
entire triple helix,
improving cooperation and information sharing across stakeholders, etc.
Pragmatically, this requires operational and administrative staff, and a direct investment proportional
with the ambition. We recommend an initial direct investment to create this structure, plus periodic
investments to (1) support specific actions aimed at stimulating large research activities and
public-private partnerships, (2) offer overviews and operational insight into the operation of CompSys
infrastructure, and (3) inform the general public through specialized and general events. Several
leading candidates already exist to establish and maintain the coalition, but essential funding is
currently lacking.

This recommendation is linked with the significant investment in personnel (R1) and in research
infrastructure (R3).

R3. Invest
in CompSys infrastructure for research, demonstrations,
proof-of-concepts, and pilots: a structural investment of €145 million over
the next 10 years.

As our society has become increasingly digitalized, computer systems and networks are being used on
a daily basis. This provides a clear opportunity to put theory, e.g., the development of algorithms and
mechanisms, to practice, and to use the insights gained from those practical deployments to further
tune the theoretical contributions. Indeed, CompSys is an experimental science [2][18].

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

However, infrastructure for computer systems and networks is expensive to procure, and for some
areas there is also the need to support the fabrication of novel experimental hardware or the
development of new specialized software. The cost of supercomputers and backbone routers runs in
the millions of Euros, for example, the experimental supercomputer Piz Daint (Switzerland) costs
around €35 million only to keep up-to-date, and the operational costs for 2-3 years match the cost of
the initial hardware and software. Such costs are often out of the range of researchers to (develop,)
purchase and experiment on. There exist some initiatives in the Netherlands, like the DAS cluster
(several
interconnected clusters with advanced processors, network, and storage devices) and the
2STiC testbed (consisting of a small nation-wide test network of programmable devices), but these
initiatives often focus on a single technology (e.g., P4 with 2STiC) and are typically only accessible by
some researchers.

We call for a structural investment in state-of-the-art CompSys infrastructure, both computer
systems and networking devices, that is co-developed and co-used in a triple-helix context,
that is, in a collaboration by academia, government, and industry. This infrastructure can be
considered a fieldlab, like for example the Do IoT fieldlab14, where the goal is to boost innovation and
where society can try out their ideas. The distinctive difference with many other fieldlabs, is that this
infrastructure would not focus on one technology, like 5G or GPUs, but computer systems and
networks in general (as we argue in this manifesto comprises many disciplines and calls for a holistic
design approach), with an emphasis on it becoming a trustworthy, responsible, and sustainable
infrastructure.

By purpose,
this infrastructure has to operate differently from a normal production
infrastructure. This infrastructure will have a stable environment used for the various demonstrators,
use cases, proofs of concept, and pre-competitive trials, and thus support technology and business
developments at various levels of technological readiness (esp. working for TRLs 1-7); this matches
the normal production purposes, albeit with a strong focus on upcoming, experimental hardware and
software. But the infrastructure will also operate as a “sand-box” environment, where new research
ideas can be tried without affecting the users, and where researchers can “break” the environment
and explore limit-cases without fear of endangering “production.” This sand-box mode is extremely
valuable: CompSys is one of the few remaining sciences where grand experiments are envisioned and
can actually be tried in practice; similarly, tried solutions that work can be merged into the stable
environment, and thus push the state-of-the-art quickly over time. And fieldlab infrastructure can
provide access to a realistic environment for the purposes of education and life-long learning.

Pragmatically, we recommend that building an experimental
infrastructure for CompSys in the
Netherlands should not be a one-time investment, but rather a long-term project comprising
tens to hundreds of millions of Euros. Existing links with EOSC, GEANT, ESFRI/SLICES, and
Gaia-X, and links of similar nature in the future, could greatly extend the capabilities and impact of
this infrastructure, and could democratize this science.

Without this investment, the Netherlands risks being excluded from the emerging CompSys
research infrastructure funded by the EU. Building and attracting our own expertise is a
prerequisite for programs such as EuroHPC; future joint-undertakings require that matching-funds for
research infrastructure are provided by each participating nation.

R4. Recognize and fund cross-disciplinary translational CompSys research,
and open ICT science.

The emergence of translational research in computer science [30] promises to change how the entire
field operates. Early adopters could reap enormous benefits, much in the same way in which early
innovators in translational medicine have changed the economic and societal structure of the field.

We recommend that cross-disciplinary translational CompSys research should receive
immediate attention and funding, commensurate with the high reward potential.

Relatively to the current organizational and funding structures of CompSys in the Netherlands,
cross-disciplinary translational research in CompSys is disruptive. Large-scale projects, e.g., aligned
with the Nationale Wetenschapsagenda, could focus on various types of translational research and
thus not have to include applied research in their program; correspondingly, applied research projects
could link to other forms of translational research, rather than having to artificially justify their link to
fundamental research. Cross-disciplinary research, focusing on CompSys technology or processes,
should be funded; so should replication studies, which are common in some areas of science but
exceedingly rare in computer science and in particular in CompSys science. The areas we have
identified in Section 2, ‘Cross-Disciplinary Translational CompSys Research’, could receive necessary
attention and create unique opportunities for science and technology.

Concrete changes related to translational research include the addition of software engineers
(scientific programmers) into the funding schemes, related to the type of research project and
proportional to their size, but separately from the regular budget-limits currently considered by NWO
programs.

Through the extended discussion on academic recognition (Erkennen en Waarderen), there is already
room for more diverse research careers in the Dutch academia. However, we recommend making
explicit that publishing artifacts resulting from translational research, e.g., FAIR and open software
and data, and helping with their adoption, should be further recognized by both academic institutions
and in NWO funding schemes. This will improve the career development prospects especially for young
researchers.

R5. Harmonize the national curriculum on CompSys topics.

Linked with the next recommendation, we recommend the harmonization (unification, to the
extent desirable and possible, retaining both common and unique aspects) of the national
curriculum on CompSys topics. This is a pragmatic recommendation, motivated by an increasing
number of students, and by the high workload and expensive infrastructure associated with each
student in this field relative to more theoretical subjects in computer science. The main benefit of a
harmonized curriculum is that young professionals will
learn the same common principles and
vocabulary.

A curriculum harmonization would also allow us to teach the basic material more systematically,
sharing expertise and resources, and would free up resources for advanced and especially unique
learning objects. Teachers from university X could help with the influx of students at university Y.
Cohorts and classrooms of reasonable size could thus be achieved for at least the more challenging
aspects of the curriculum, which require much interaction, apprenticeship, and lab work for students
to understand deeply. (A similar model exists for other core subjects in higher education, e.g.,
mathematics.)

41

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

If the recommendation to extend CompSys education and training to all levels of our society, and in
particular to early age (that is, school and high-school), is implemented, then having a unified learning
trajectory for this age, focusing on computer systems literacy, would be desirable as well.

R6. Extend CompSys education and training to all levels of our society.

The digitalization of the Dutch society is increasing, and we foresee it to be irreversible. The
magnitude of the change can be exemplified through a simple contrast between the level and type of
societal infrastructure and services used a decade ago, and what we use today. Currently, computer
intuition and often also knowledge have become necessary not only to run the economy, but also for
daily activities such as doing bank transfers, laundry, and taxes, logging into government portals to
make use of social services, using public transportation, making doctors’ appointments, and talking to
family and friends. Hence, it is of utmost importance to (1) include everyone in the educational
process early, and (2) ensure life-long learning and training opportunities for all.

let alone the CompSys area,

Although the use of digital goods and services is widespread in the Netherlands [36], exposure to
is often delayed to the ternary and other
computer science,
higher-education institutes. There are very limited opportunities for high-school students to learn and
educate themselves about computer science principles, approaches, processes, and applications. In
contrast, computer science has emerged as a core subject in the basic education curriculums in
countries like India, China, USA, and even European countries like the UK, Estonia, and Romania.
Such initial exposure is important to develop a society-wide “CompSys temperament” similar to the
“scientific temperament” that we expect from the Dutch population. A school-level computing and
networking curriculum can include exposure to problem solving, programming, skills building,
experiments and evaluation of ICT infrastructure, and computing processes and services. For example,
Simon Peyton-Jones, a pioneer of computing, has led the UK-wide push to include computer science in
primary and secondary education for all students and establish Computer Science as a Secondary
Education academic qualification (GCSE) [38]. From their manifesto [38]: “Computer Science is a
foundational subject discipline, like maths and natural science, that every child should learn
from primary school onward”.

We recommend to ensure CompSys education and training become accessible to all levels of
our society, for all. Points of focus include: (1) Include computer science education in primary and
secondary education in a nationwide systematic policy push; (2) Develop a computer science study
curriculum for schools (ages 6-16), as core courses or as alternatives to other early STEM education;
(3) Encourage diverse people to participate in computing; (4) Offer opportunities for further education
and training for life-long learning in computer systems; (5) Because CompSys is an experimental
science, this also implies investing in the required infrastructure for laboratories; and (6) Similarly to
other design-first areas, foster a culture of making and breaking, through maker-spaces.

The need for an inclusive digitalization of the society is already recognized at the level of Government
and Secretaries of State, and increasingly also by ministries (e.g., MinBZK, MinEZK). An explicit push
to make CompSys diverse and open is required (see also R7), because the Netherlands cannot afford
to leave knowledge, access, and exposure to computing and networking as just a hobby or only to a
select few. Such push at an early stage of education is also critical to make computing and networking
open and inclusive for all. In such a system, a diverse set of students (for example, by gender,
socioeconomic background, and immigration background) can be helped to discover and develop
CompSys skills together. Initiatives in this direction have appeared in the Netherlands, from the IPN
EDI working groups (Alice and Eve exhibition, Celebrating women in computing), the VHTO school
outreach, the Hedy Programming language in schools (Felienne Hermans), the inclusive Honours
Programme at the VU, but a systematic nationwide policy and directions are still missing.

42

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

We advocate for life-long learning on CompSys topics. Computing and networking ideas and
concepts are being developed at a very fast pace and look very different when checking at intervals of
only 5-10 years. The rate of innovation is one of the primary reasons for the success of computer
systems in our daily lives, but we must also ensure that the people who enter the Dutch economy are
not left behind as the CompSys field moves forward. Offering regular training sessions (public-private
partnership), opportunities for further education, public lectures, workloads, popular culture books,
and summer and bootcamps is becoming necessary.

R7. Link investment in research to hiring from under-represented groups,
to foster diversity.

The authors and co-signatories of this document are firmly committed to improve the diversity of this
field. One clear step in this direction is that investment in research should be tied to clear targets for
hiring diverse people, e.g., from under-represented groups.

Responding to the requests for investment made in recommendations R1, R2, and R3, which are all
sizable, would enable the Dutch Government to provide leadership in fostering diversity. Funding
through the Groeifondsprogramma,
in particular, could be tied to including diversity goals. The
resulting network and people hired through this program would provide a significant step forward for
diversity in CompSys in the Netherlands.

R8. Ensure alignment with and integration into EU technology platforms
and societal goals.

Geopolitically, the Netherlands is tightly integrated in the European projects proposed by the EU.
However, the digital world offers new opportunities, new frontiers, and new political choices. Instead of
aligning itself with emerging European technology platforms, the Netherlands might align with the US
Big Tech companies or choose to rely on technology developed in China.

Our recommendation is direct: the Netherlands should focus on the long-term integration into
EU technology platforms and on full alignment with the EU societal goals. Although these
alignments will be initially costly, for the time-horizon 2035 it will deliver digital sovereignty from
technology platforms that are not necessarily aligned, among others, with the economic interests of
the EU, with taxation in the Netherlands on par with other value-adding industries, with respect for
human rights, and with engagement against climate change. In turn, this form of digital sovereignty
inclusivity,
will help uphold the values and norms that define the Dutch society, including social
equality, and fairness.

The cost of integration and alignment is that the Netherlands must co-sponsor EU activities such as
those described in Section I.2.4, ‘Digitalization in the Netherlands and aligned with the EU’. Investing
in the European Green Deal, in EuroHPC and the 5G Toolbox, in the EOSC and Gaia-X platforms, may
not come cheap initially and will require continuous funding. However, the resulting economic and
societal benefits, including brain mobility to the Netherlands (which is historically a destination of such
mobility), would more than compensate for the cost – see the box ‘Economic and societal impact of
CompSys in the Netherlands’.

43

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

R9. NWO should introduce an ICT (infrastructure) plan in every NWO
proposal that relies for its success on ICT infrastructure, matching the
existing requirement for a data plan, to be evaluated by experts.

The NWO mandates data management plans in all competitive programs, aimed to ensure used and
generated data is freely (FAIRly) accessible, thus aiming to make research more reproducible. The
introduction of the data management plan has improved the process of publishing scientific data and
contributes to open science in general. The data plan is organized as follows. Costs related to data
management are eligible for funding. The data management plan must be developed in consultation
with an expert (a “data steward”), typically located at the same institution as the applicant. Although
the data management plan is not considered in the decision to fund the application, the application
requires such a plan, the reviewers can give feedback that the project officer considers, and the
project cannot start without the data management plan being approved by NWO.

Currently, no similar plan exists for ICT infrastructure and services, presumably because they are
often considered a “solved issue”. This happens even when the project relies on large hardware and
software resources, or on infrastructure and services that are under active research in the community
and/or are not commercially available. This is particularly surprising given that (1) the Netherlands
has two active organizations whose core mission is to develop, implement, and facilitate access to ICT
infrastructure and services for researchers, namely SURF and the Netherlands e-Science Center, and
(2) each academic institution has a team focusing on ICT infrastructure and services.

We recommend that NWO should require for all the grants, in the long term and after a gentle
transition, a plan for ICT infrastructure and services (i.e., ICT plan). The ICT plan should follow
a similar approach as the data management plan. And, like for the data management plan, the ICT
plan can be proportional in length to the reliance of the project on ICT infrastructure (and thus void if
no such infrastructure is required). Thus: (1) the plan should be developed in consultation with an
expert, (2) reviewers can give feedback that the project officer will consider, and (3) the project
cannot start until this plan is approved by NWO. Unlike the data management plan, where the main
concern is long-term data preservation after the research has occurred, research depending on ICT
infrastructure and services cannot occur at all without it. Thus, we recommend that the mandate
further specifies that (4) the plan on ICT infrastructure and services is actively considered for funding
decisions, including refusing to fund proposals where the planned ICT resources are insufficient and/or
infeasible to acquire.

To facilitate adoption, the ICT plan should be structured and streamlined in the NWO processes,
such that it is not considerably longer or more difficult to fill in than the data management plan. To
transition to this mandatory status, we recommend that the ICT plan is initially an optional element
in new proposals, while being actively promoted and strongly encouraged for proposals above a
100KEUR funding budget. The transition could end within 5 years.

Finally, to make the ICT plan feasible and efficient for proposals where the ICT plan is required,
we recommend allowing proponents to consider the ICT plan costs as a separate funding element,
and, for efficiency and sustainability reasons, to actively incentivise and support proponents to use
already available ICT infrastructure and services, through organizations like SURF and the Netherlands
e-Science Center.

44

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

R10. Align strategic investments in computing and networking in the
Netherlands.

Various technology areas considered essential
in the Dutch economy and society for the future
decades, like AI, GovTech, and quantum, are experiencing rapid advances and increased competition.
And for good reason, as these technologies are clearly promising. Yet, not all aspects of these
technologies receive attention and, in particular, the need for advanced CompSys infrastructure is
often overlooked or simply assumed available. We see here an opportunity for the Netherlands, to
distinguish itself as a key player in AI and quantum that looks at the entire chain. After all, AI cannot
run without computer systems, GovTech relies on the ability to collect, process, and share citizen data,
and even the quantum internet relies on non-quantum computer systems and networks.

We recommend making strategic investments to form strong links between CompSys and AI,
between CompSys and Quantum, and between CompSys and GovTech, such that the
Netherlands can position itself as a key player who has digital sovereignty over all (critical) aspects of
digitalization instead of only a few building blocks. One of the ways to achieve this is to pursue R2 and
establish a CompSys coalition, which could then serve as liaison with the similar coalitions, e.g., in AI
and quantum. Another is to make sure large grants from the Government include clauses that
incentivize each of these directions to link to the others.

To prevent that progress becomes too slow due to delays in achieving strategic and executive
alignment, different fields could develop independently but with a coordinating, cross-disciplinary
alliance that would aim to reconcile the differences and forge alignment in the mid-term (by 2035).

45

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

Conclusion

Computer systems and networks (CompSys) are the backbone of the digital economy. This CompSys
Manifesto has explained the need for CompSys research and education. This enables the moonshot of
transitioning to a fully digitalized Dutch society: the grand societal challenge of digitalizing the country
and linking it to the European ICT platforms, while tailoring to what the society expects from ICT
infrastructure, namely maintainability, responsibility, and sustainability.

We have proposed a groundbreaking, holistic, and collective technology roadmap, where the high
quality of CompSys researchers in the Netherlands can leverage and extend their global
content-related leadership. We have explained that Dutch CompSys research could continue to deliver
remarkable and outsized contributions to the Dutch society, if linked with translational CompSys
research, where cross-disciplinary uses of CompSys technology can create new, groundbreaking
opportunities for a variety of sciences and domains, including the growing fields of AI, machine
learning, and quantum computing. We have also identified key opportunities for Dutch higher
education, which should truly service all in our society.

Looking at horizon 2035, to maximize impact, CompSys research in the Netherlands requires the
formation of a national CompSys coalition, and immediate and sustained investment. The field can
only hope to deliver, and the fields that rely on it, such as computational sciences, will only continue to
cross-disciplinary translational CompSys research is immediately placed on the
prosper,
government’s agenda for investment. The field also requires systemic investments in CompSys
infrastructure for education, research, demonstrations, and proof-of-concepts.

if

To promote diversity in this critical field for the Dutch society, we also recommend linking investment
in CompSys research to hiring from under-represented groups – in particular, women, minorities, and
recent immigrants –, and at stimulating diversity wherever the government provides funding.

The 10 recommendations, in summary:

1.

Invest in personnel for holistic CompSys research: a structural investment of €195 million
over the next 10 years, co-financed by the Government and by industry stakeholders.

2. Establish and maintain a coalition for CompSys, through a direct investment of

€15 million over the next 10 years.

3.

Invest in CompSys infrastructure for research, demonstrations, proof-of-concepts, and
pilots: a structural investment of €145 million over the next 10 years.

4. Recognize and fund cross-disciplinary translational CompSys research and open ICT science.

5. Harmonize the national curriculum on CompSys topics, to the extent possible.

6. Extend CompSys education and training to all levels of our society. Be inclusive.

7. Link investment in research to hiring from under-represented groups, to foster diversity.

8. Ensure alignment with and integration into EU technology platforms and societal goals.

9.

Introduce an ICT plan in NWO proposals that rely for their success on ICT infrastructure,
with form following that of the data-management plan.

10. Align strategic investments in computing and networking in the Netherlands.

CompSys NL Manifesto - v.2.4, May 2022

Signatories

This manifesto represents the combined views of
tens of specialists, clients, and societal
stakeholders, raising awareness about challenges and opportunities in computer systems and
networking (CompSys) research in the Netherlands toward shaping a national strategy in collaboration
with the government, funding agencies, and other stakeholders. Although this manifesto is the first
combined view in the Netherlands on computer systems and networking research and education in
more than two decades, the experts that co-sign this manifesto have recently published many peer-
and expert-reviewed papers on the key topics, thus obtaining international validation and recognition
for the views expressed in this document.

We remain open to extending the support base for this manifesto. To work together on the themes of
this manifesto, we welcome you to the IPN SIG on Future Computer and Network Systems (FCNS). If
you are interested in this initiative, please contact us.
