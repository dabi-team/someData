Abstract: 

Compartment models of cell culture are widely used in cytology, pharmacology, toxicology and 

other  fields.  Numerical  simulation,  data  modeling  and  prediction  of  compartment  models  can  be 

realized by traditional differential equation modeling methods. At the same time, with the development 

of  software  and  hardware,  Physical  Informed  Neural  Network  (PINN)  is  widely  used  to  solve 

differential  equation  models.  This  work  models,  simulates  and  predicts  the  cell  culture  compartment 

model  based  on  the  machine  learning  framework  PyTorch  with  an  16  hidden  layers  neural  network, 

including 8 linear layers and 8 feedback active layers. The results showed a loss value of 0.0004853 for 

three-component four-parameter quantitative pharmacodynamic model predictions in this way, which is 

evaluated by Mean Square Error (MSE). In summary, Physical Informed Neural Network can serve as 

an effective tool to deal with cell culture compartment models and may perform better in dealing with 

big datasets.

1.  Introduction 

Animal  tissue  culture  is  widely  used  in  quantitative  pharmacology.  In  the  animal  tissue  culture 

process, cells often present different states. Among these States, vital state, apoptotic state and necrotic 

state are common. The mutual transformation and transformation rate of these three states can directly 

evaluate the cytotoxicity of drugs, which provides a reference for drug research and development and 

cell biology research (Guchelaar et al., 1998). Many different types of mathematical models have been 

used to evaluate the state of cells in tissue culture and the toxicological and pharmacological effects of 

additives, especially the muti-compartment model. 

The multi-compartment model is a mathematical model consisting of varying relationships among 

components and can be represented by differential equations. In 1838, this kind of model was used to 

distinguish  between  changes  originating  from  capillary  blood  and  changes  originating  from 

extracellular space (Rydhög et al., 1838), which may be the first time for using compartment model in 

biology  research.  Subsequently,  compartment  models  were  gradually  used  in  cell  culture,  including 

pharmacodynamics (Lobo et al., 2002), immunology (Marino et al., 2011) and cell production system 

(Nakata  et  al.,  2012).  In  recent  years,  more  and  more  cell  compartment  models  have  been  reported, 

including the two-compartment model for describing plasmid dynamics in the gut (Alderliesten et al., 

2022) and the three-compartment model for drug delivery (Becker et al., 2022). The widespread use of 

compartment models undoubtedly creates a huge demand for tools to deal with them. 

Different from the general finite element method (such as the Euler method, Runge-Kutta method, 

etc.),  the  Physical  Informed  Neural  Network  (PINN)  for  solving  differential  equations  was  not 

proposed until 1994 (Dissanayake et al.). With the development of Software and Hardware of Scientific 

computing, the shortcoming that the PINN method needs a lot of calculation is gradually overcome and 

the advantages are shown by more and more research (Nascimento et al., 2020). With a large number of 

compartment models being used to model, predict and evaluate the covid-19 pandemic, more and more 

studies on the application of PINN to compartment model modeling have emerged (Treibert et al., 2022; 

Long  et  al.,  2021).  But  only  a  few  research  focus  on  the  application  of  PINN  in  the  field  of  tissue 

culture,  except  a  new  creative  work  by  Batuwatta-Gamage,  which  use  PINN  to  predict  moisture 

concentration and shrinkage of a plant cell during drying (Batuwatta-Gamage et al., 2022). In summary, 

PINN  gives  researchers  a  method  to  deal  with  modeling  prediction  and  numerical  simulation  of 

compartment models in animal tissue culture. 

In  this  work,  we  model,  simulate  and  predict  a  widely  cited  cell  culture  compartment  model 

introduced  by  Guchelaar  in  1998.  The  Implementation  of  PINN  is  based  on  the  machine  learning 

framework  PyTorch  with  an  8  layers  neural  network,  including  four  linear  layers  and  four  feedback 

active layers. After the introduction, the data and method part briefly describes our data and methods, 

especially the mathematical derivation and neural network model. The results section will focus on the 

process, results and evaluation of our modeling and prediction. After that, the discussion part mainly 

focuses  on  the  comparison  between  our  work  and  other  work,  as  well  as  suggestions  for  follow-up 

research. To summarize the whole work, the conclusion gives the overall contribution of this study and 

the views drawn from it.

2.1 Data Source 

Data collection from the graph & table in Guchelaar’s research, which is the data from HSB2 cells 
determined  upon  continuous  incubation  with  10-6  M  ARA-C,  including  the  percent  number  of  cell’s 
different states in over 70h. 

2.2 Cell state compartment model of animal tissue culture 

The  compartment  model  we  used  is  shown  in  Figure  1,  which  is  a  three-component 

four-parameter  classical  model.  In  the  model,  cells  are  allowed  to  transfer  from  a  vital  state  to  an 

apoptotic  and  necrotic  state,  in  which  the  necrotic  state  is  irreversible,  and  the  transferred  state  can 

return to vital or further necrosis.

The differential equation of this model can be written as the differential form of three components 

with respect to time:

= −(𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 + 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑛𝑛) ⋅ 𝑑𝑑 + 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ⋅ 𝐴𝐴

The  main  network structure  of  this  work uses  the form of four  linear  layers  and  four  activation 

layers, which is shown in Figure 2. Mean Square Error (MSE) is set as the loss function to optimize the 

training process. The selection of these structures is mainly based on the author's experience in MIT AI: 

machine learning in healthcare - Johnson program.

4. Discussion 

In recent years, numerous fields have been subverted by artificial neural network technology, 
including artificial intelligence and machine learning. But because machine learning is a research 
method rising in recent years, it is not yet fully mature. The use of machine learning methods for 
cell state modeling is indeed relatively rare. Based on this study, we can see the great potential of 
in  animal  tissue  culture,  various  cell  cultures  and 
Physical 
pharmacological research.   

Informed  Neural  Network 

Compared  with  related  studies,  in  terms  of  accuracy,  the  neural  network  method  of  this 

 
 
 
 
study is based on hundreds of thousands of rounds of training, and its accuracy is two orders of 
magnitude higher than that of the original study (Guchelaar et al., 1998). However, from the data 
set of Batuwatta-Gamage’s studies (2022), the small data set limits the play of this method. The 
method  of  informed  neural  networks  should  be  more  suitable  for  larger  data  sets.  Compared 
with  the  research  on  Deep  Neural  Network  (Bianco  et  al.,  2022),  PINN  is  a  relatively  simple 
network  structure,  which  makes  it  more  suitable  for  the  cross-field  of  knowledge-driven 
modeling and data-driven modeling. In contrast, Deep Neural Networks generally performs well 
only in data-driven modeling, which limits the application of this method in small data sets. 

In some perspective, this is an immature attempt. For further study, larger data sets, more 
optimal  network  structure  and  training  methods,  and  linkage  with  other  machine  learning 
methods  are  necessary.  Specifically,  a  large  number  of  pharmacodynamic  quantitative  models 
and  their  contrasts  can  to  some  extent  be  evaluated  within  the  same  training  process,  which 
needs a large dataset with or without lebels. Moreover, Shallow networks and different learning 
rate oscillators may better cope with overfitting of different data sets as well as training efficiency 
problems. 

5. Conclusion 

In summary, PINN is a method based on machine learning and artificial neural network. This 
study  shows  that  it  can  be  used  to  model,  predict  and  simulate  the  compartmental  models  in 
animal tissue culture, which have a better precision, faster speed, and some scalability.
