Abstract
Acetone-13C1 is a complex organic molecule with two internal methyl ( – CH3) rotors having relatively low
eﬀective barriers to internal rotation of about 249 cm−1. This leads to two low-lying torsional modes and ﬁve
internal rotation components resulting in a dense and complicated spectrum. In this study, measurements
of acetone-13C1 were performed with an isotopically enriched sample in the frequency range 37–1102 GHz.
Predicted spectra of acetone-13C1 created with ERHAM allow for future radio astronomical searches.

Loomis-Wood plots are one approach to improve and fasten the analysis of such crowded spectra. In this
study, the new Loomis-Wood software LLWP was used for fast and conﬁdent assignments. LLWP focuses on
being user-friendly, intuitive, and applicable to a broad range of assignment tasks. The software is presented
here and can be downloaded from llwp.astro.uni-koeln.de.

1. Introduction

For

13C1

Acetone was ﬁrst detected in Sgr B2(N) by
Combes et al. [1] and later conﬁrmed by Snyder
et al. [2]. In the laboratory, ﬁrst lines up to 31 GHz
were found by Bak et al. [3] and Weatherly and
Williams [4]. Swalen and Costain presented a struc-
tural study based on microwave spectroscopy [5].
Several subsequent studies investigated the spec-
trum of acetone, its isotopologs, and vibrationally
excited states of the main isotopolog [6–15].
asymmetric

isotopolog
(13CH3C(O)CH3), an initial analysis was pre-
sented by Lovas and Groner [12] consisting of
55 transitions up to 25 GHz. Their results were
extended by Ordu et al.
[15] to 110 transitions
up to 355 GHz. The low number of assigned
transitions in Ref. [15], compared to 9715 assigned
transitions for an enriched sample of the symmetric
13C(O)CH3 isotopolog in the same study,
CH3
resulted from the lack of an enriched sample of
the asymmetric species. We revisited the spectrum
with an enriched sample to circumvent diﬃcul-
ties tied to the low 2.2 % natural abundance of
acetone-13C1 (see Fig. 1).

of 249.232 cm−1 was derived for
the parent
species1 [14]. In comparison to the main isotopolog,
one methyl 12C atom is substituted by a 13C atom.
The coupling of the two distinguishable internal ro-
tors with the overall rotation results in ﬁve internal
rotation components labeled (following the nomen-
clature of Ref. [12]) as (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1),
and (1, 2) which will be introduced in more detail
later.

The internal rotation components and two ener-
getically low-lying torsional modes lead to a dense
and complicated spectrum. Similar conditions can
be found for many other complex molecules, with
isotopologs, hyperﬁne structure, and other inter-
actions being additional factors for a complex and
line-rich spectrum. Analyzing spectra close to the
confusion limit, i.e., assigning lines unambiguously,
proves to be cumbersome with conventional meth-
ods. Approaches to accommodate this challenge
include on the software side e.g., Loomis-Wood
plots (LWPs) [16], Fortrat diagrams, and for in-

frared data the Automated Spectral Assignment
Procedure [17] as well as on the experimental side
e.g., double-resonance spectroscopy [18, 19] and
its advancement the double-modulation double-
resonance spectroscopy [20].

LWPs display adjacent transitions of a series on
top of each other. This makes it easy to follow se-
ries and identify deviations by using adjacent tran-
sitions as reference. This results in more conﬁdent
and eﬃcient assignments. Several programs us-
ing this approach exist in the literature, with Pgo-
pher [21], the AABS package [22], and LWW [23]
being three popular options. These programs are
valuable tools, but unfortunately, they either lack
diﬀerent methods to determine center frequencies,
use of experimental spectrum instead of peak lists,
easy setup, support for multiple operating systems,
documentation, or combinations of these.
In ad-
dition, the advancement in graphical user interface
(GUI) libraries and computational power of per-
sonal computers alleviates some of the restrictions
that previous generations of programs faced.

Here LLWP is presented, a newly written
Loomis-Wood plotting software for fast and con-
ﬁdent assignment of real spectra. It focuses on be-
ing intuitive and user-friendly while being proﬁcient
for a wide range of assignment tasks. The analysis
of the dense and complicated spectrum of acetone-
13C1 beneﬁted immensely from the use of LLWP.
First, the experimental details are described
(Sec. 2), next the newly developed LLWP program
is presented (Sec. 3), then the analysis of spectra
of acetone-13C1 is explained (Sec. 4), and ﬁnally
the results are discussed and an outlook is given
(Sec. 5).

Figure 1: Spectrum and predictions (red sticks) of acetone-
13C1 at natural abundance (2.2 %, top) and for the enriched
sample (98 %, bottom). The internal rotation components of
the oblate paired transitions 270,27 ← 261,26 and 271,27 ←
260,26 are shown. For the enriched sample, the typical triplet
pattern is clearly visible whereas at natural abundance all
three peaks are blended and the pattern is not visible.

2. Experimental Details

Measurements were performed with a synthesized
sample of acetone-13C1. High-resolution broad-
band spectra were measured in the frequency ranges
37–67 GHz, 70–129 GHz, and 167–1102 GHz using
diﬀerent experiments in Cologne, resulting in a to-
tal broadband coverage of 1024 GHz. First, the syn-
thesis is described (Sec. 2.1) then the diﬀerent ex-
perimental setups are presented (Sec. 2.2).

2.1. Synthesis of Acetone-13C1

The sample was synthesized using a procedure
described by Winkel et al. [24]. In a 50 mL round-
bottomed ﬂask equipped with a reﬂux condenser,
a dropping funnel and a nitrogen inlet were intro-
duced magnesium turnings (0.4 g, 16.8 mmol, 1.2
equiv.) and 15 ml of diethyl ether. 13C-methyl io-
dide (2.0 g, 14 mmol, 1 equiv.) diluted in 10 ml of
diethyl ether was added dropwise at such a rate
that a gentle reﬂux was maintained. The mixture
was reﬂuxed for 10 min and then cooled at −10 ◦C.
Freshly distilled acetaldehyde (0.74 g; 16.8 mmol;
1.2 equiv.) was slowly added, to give a white slurry
and the mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 30 min. The ether was evaporated and 5 ml of
water were carefully added. Hydrochloric acid (6N)
was added until pH 6. The low boiling point com-
pounds containing 2-propanol and water were dis-
tilled in vacuo (0.1 mbar) and then slowly added
to a cold solution of sodium bichromate dihydrate
(5.4 g, 18 mmol, 1.3 equiv.) and sulfuric acid at 96%
(2.1 g) in 3 ml of water. The temperature should not
exceed 50 ◦C. After 10 min at room temperature,

line equipped with two U-traps. The ﬁrst immersed
in a cold bath at −60 ◦C removed the high boiling
point compounds and the second immersed in a liq-
uid nitrogen bath selectively trapped the acetone.
This procedure yielded 0.74 g (90% yield) with 98%
enrichment of acetone-13C1.

2.2. Experimental Setups

Broadband measurements of the synthesized
acetone-13C1 sample were performed using three
diﬀerent experimental setups in Cologne [15, 25].
Additionally, single measurements with longer inte-
gration times were performed in frequency ranges
with low source output power2. Especially the fre-
quency range 37–67 GHz was important as in this
low-frequency range the ﬁve internal rotation com-
ponents are often resolved. All experiments share
a general structure, consisting of a source, an ab-
sorption cell, and a detector [15, 25]. Horn anten-
nas, lenses, and mirrors are used to guide the beam
through the absorption cells and onto the detector.
The absorption cells are made out of borosilicate
glass. They are connected with a pump for evacuat-
ing the cell and with an inlet for the sample. Diﬀer-
ent detector techniques, being Schottky detectors
(<500 GHz) and a cryogenically cooled bolometer
(>500 GHz), were used to optimize the SNR. Lock-
in ampliﬁers with a 2f -demodulation scheme were
used. As a result, lineshapes look similar to the sec-
ond derivative of a Voigt proﬁle. All measurements
were performed at room temperature and with gas
pressures around 10 µbar.

For 37–67 GHz, the signal is guided directly to
the antenna and not multiplied, for 70–129 GHz a
tripler is used. For both frequency ranges, Schot-
tky detectors are employed and connected to an in-
house made bias box. The absorption cell consists
of two 7 m glass cells in single-pass mode adding
up to a total absorption path length of 14 m. The
experimental setup is described in greater detail in
Ref. [15].

The frequency range 167–515 GHz was covered
with a commercially available source from Virginia
Diodes Inc. (VDI) with three diﬀerent setups con-
sisting of cascaded doublers and triplers. As in the

previous experiment, Schottky detectors were uti-
lized. The absorption cell of 5 m length was used
in double-pass mode resulting in a total absorption
path length of 10 m. More detailed information can
be found in Refs. [15, 25].

The frequency range 500–1100 GHz was mea-
sured with two diﬀerent setups of cascaded multi-
pliers (VDI) and a QMC QNbB/PTC(2+XBI) hot-
electron bolometer. A single 5 m cell was used in
single-pass mode.

Standing waves were removed from the spectra

by Fourier ﬁltering using a self-written script3.

3. The LLWP Program

LLWP is presented, a newly developed software
based on LWPs for exploring and assigning spec-
tra. It aims to be eﬃcient, easy to handle, and in
particular user-friendly. Additionally, LLWP oﬀers
great customizability and ﬂexibility. Distinguishing
factors from previous programs [21–23] are the use
of real spectra instead of peak lists, and most im-
portantly the simple setup and the improved user
experience that is tied to the advancement in graph-
ical user interface (GUI) libraries. The software, its
documentation, and contact information for feed-
back as well as feature requests can be found on
LLWP’s website4.

First,

the technical details are summarized
(Sec. 3.1), then the core functionality is described
in some detail to highlight the main advantages for
potential users (Sec. 3.2), and last a selection of
additional features that support a thorough analy-
sis are introduced to highlight the variety of tools
provided by LLWP (Sec. 3.3).

3.1. Technical Details

LLWP is written in python 3. Therefore it runs
on all operating systems that support python 3 and
the required libraries. For good performance, Pan-
das [26] and NumPy [27] are used for data han-
dling as they are written in C/C++. The GUI
uses PyQt5 and the ﬁtting uses SciPy [28]. Plots
are created with Matplotlib [29]. For the handling
of Pickett’s *.cat, *.lin, and *.egy formats [30] our
own Pyckett library was used5. In addition to the

2Transitions were ordered by the predicted intensity and
the top 98 transitions in the frequency range 750–790 GHz
as well as the top 1008 transitions in the frequency range
37–67 GHz were measured.

python code, a Windows executable is provided on
the website, making installation on Windows ma-
chines as simple as downloading a single ﬁle.

Certain tasks that are either computationally or
I/O intensive are threaded to not block the user
interface resulting in a responsive experience. To
keep performant with large datasets, each subplot
plots only its currently visible data6. Additionally,
even these subsets are downsampled if they exceed
a user-selectable value.

3.2. Core Functionality

LLWP’s core functionality is assigning center fre-
quencies from a real spectrum to quantum numbers
of predicted transitions. LLWP relies on Loomis-
Wood plots for increased conﬁdence and speed. The

6The important step is to reduce the complete dataset to
only the visible dataset before handing it to the plot function
of the used library. For typical usecases, this drastically de-
creases computation time and memory consumption. How-
ever, for the user, apart from the mentioned performance
beneﬁts, there is no tangible diﬀerence between plotting all
data but only showing an excerpt and only plotting the data
in the excerpt

LWP consists of multiple subplots arranged in a
vertical fashion. Each subplot shows a region of the
spectrum with the same width around its predicted
center frequency. The series of predicted center fre-
quencies of all subplots is called reference series.
The easiest example would be a linear rotor which
usually shows only small deviations from equidis-
tantly spaced transitions with a distance of 2B.
When using these ideal frequencies as the reference
series, the LWP shows the deviations of the real
transitions from this idealized model. The trend
in the LWP makes it easy to identify and follow
the series and the row number corresponds to the
J quantum number of the upper state and makes
assignment straight forward. The software is not
opinionated, meaning it is not limited to speciﬁc
units or formats and works with 1–6 quantum num-
bers (or even no quantum numbers at all). Addi-
tionally, LLWP can display multiple Loomis-Wood
plots next to each other (see Fig. A.1). Possible use
cases are infrared data, e.g., examining P -, Q-, and
R-branch series simultaneously, heavily perturbed
systems, e.g., showing interaction partners side by

side, or even as simple cases as comparing predic-
tions from two diﬀerent methods. On the other
extreme, LLWP can be used with only a single row
and column to explore and assign spectra in a single
plot, basically neglecting the Loomis-Wood charac-
ter. In summary, LLWP is a versatile tool for fast
and conﬁdent assignments.

In the following, the most basic workﬂow is de-
scribed, consisting of I) loading data, II) setting the
reference series, III) assigning, and IV) saving the
results7. Simultaneously, the ﬁve areas of the main
window (see Fig. 2) are introduced.

I) The ﬁrst step is to load data into the pro-
gram. Three diﬀerent types of data can be used
in the program: i) ﬁles providing the experimental
measurements, ii) ﬁles providing predictions, and
iii) ﬁles providing already assigned lines. All three
data types can be added via the Files menu or per
drag-and-drop. After this step, the Loomis-Wood
plot (green rectangle in Fig. 2) shows a default se-
ries. Important controls for the LWP are available
on top, controlling the number of rows and columns
as well as the width of the subplots.

II) In the second step, a user-deﬁned reference
series is selected in the Reference Series window
(blue rectangle in Fig. 2). Three options are avail-
able for specifying the center frequencies of the se-
ries, either by i) using catalog ﬁles and selecting a
series, ii) via a list of frequencies, or iii) by enter-
ing a custom equation depending on N (index of
the subplot) and N0 (oﬀset index). For the catalog
ﬁles, Pickett’s *.cat format is supported by default
but all ﬁxed-width-formats (FWF) can be used.

III) Next, transitions of the reference series are
assigned by selecting an area around the peak
and the selected proﬁle is ﬁt to the selected data.
Currently available line proﬁles are a Gaussian,
Lorentzian, and Voigt proﬁle as well as their ﬁrst
and second derivatives. Additionally, a polynomial
with a selectable rank, a procedure testing poly-
nomials with diﬀerent ranks and using the best
one, or a center-of-mass procedure adapted from
Pgopher [21] are available. The determined cen-
ter frequency and, if a catalog ﬁle is used, also the
quantum numbers are added to the Catalog of
newly assigned Lines window (yellow rectangle
in Fig. 2). Additionally, the uncertainty is set as i)
a user-deﬁned default value, ii) the absolute value of

obs-calc, iii) user input to a dialog, or iv) the uncer-
tainty from the ﬁtting routine8. In the Catalog of
newly assigned Lines window, the assignments
can be edited or deleted. Already assigned lines are
highlighted in the program to reduce confusion and
prevent the user from unintentionally assigning the
same line multiple times. Steps II) and III) can be
repeated for any desired reference series.

IV) When all targeted transitions are assigned,
they are saved to a ﬁle, with Pickett’s *.lin format
as the default format but all FWFs are available.

Additionally, the Conﬁgure Plots window (red
rectangle in Fig. 2) provides further options for
the appearance of the plot, with the most impor-
tant being the scale of the LWP. Either i) each
plot is scaled individually, ii) all plots are scaled
by the minimum and maximum of the whole spec-
trum, or iii) the user can set a custom scale. For i)
the predictions are also scaled individually whereas
for ii) and iii) the predictions are scaled relative to
the experimental spectrum. Furthermore, the Log
window (gray rectangle in Fig. 2) shows messages,
warnings, and errors.

For convenience, all options can be set as de-
fault and the references to all currently opened ﬁles
can be saved into a project eliminating the need of
reloading all ﬁles individually.

3.3. Additional Features

Several modules extend LLWP’s core functional-
ity. Here, selected modules for an extended anal-
ysis, being the i) blended lines module, ii) series-
ﬁnder module, iii) peakﬁnder module, and iv) resid-
uals module, are presented with a short example of
their respective use. For more information on the
modules visit the online documentation.

i) A major inconvenience for the assignment pro-
cess are blended lines, as they make it complicated
to determine precise center frequencies. Many pro-
grams (e.g., ERHAM [31, 32] and SPFIT [30]) have
built-in mechanisms to deal with blended lines. For
these cases, LLWP provides the ability to assign all
blended lines to the center frequency of the blend

trum and can be saved to a *.csv ﬁle. In addition,
the peaks can be limited to so far unassigned peaks
by providing a distance that peaks have to deviate
from assigned transitions. This allows to ﬁnd the
experimentally strongest, but yet unassigned peaks.
iv) Assigned transitions can be compared with
predicted transitions in the residuals module. By
default, the residuals νObs −νCalc are shown against
νObs (see Fig. A.3). The residuals allow to assess
the performance of the model and visually detect
deviation patterns. However, the x- and y-axis
quantities can be chosen freely. Therefore, a mul-
titude of diﬀerent plots can be created by the user,
e.g., quantum number coverage plots (see Fig. A.2)
or weighted residuals (see Fig. A.4). For greater
control, the transitions can be ﬁltered and sub-
groups can be colored to highlight them in the plot.
To summarize, the modules complement the pro-
gram’s core capabilities and focus on more speciﬁc
tasks.

4. Spectroscopic Fingerprint of Acetone

Acetone-13C1 (13CH3C(O)CH3) is an asymmet-
ric rotor with κ = (2B − A − C)/(A − C) = 0.3150,
meaning acetone is an oblate rotor but far from the
symmetric limit of +1. The only nonzero dipole
moment component of the main isotopolog is along
the b-inertial axis with a value of 2.93(3) D 9 [7].
This results in a strong b-type spectrum with the
selection rules ∆J = 0, ±1 and ∆Ka = ±1, (±3, ...)
and ∆Kc = ±1, (±3, ...).

The two distinguishable internal methyl rotors
lead to ﬁve internal rotation components which are
labeled as (σ1, σ2) with σ1 and σ2 being the sym-
metry numbers. The nomenclature is adapted from
Lovas and Groner [12], see their work for more in-
formation. The ﬁve components are (0, 0), (0, 1),
(1, 0), (1, 1), and (1, 2). For transitions with low
frequencies, often all ﬁve internal rotation compo-
nents are resolved with an intensity ratio of 1:1:2:2:2
(see Fig. 4). Single measurements of such resolved
transitions were essential to accurately determine
the energy tunneling parameters (cid:15) of the ERHAM
model [31, 32]. For transitions with high quantum

9Acetone-13C1 is expected to have a small non-zero a-
type dipole moment due to the 13C-atom. Thus, also a-
type transitions are allowed. However, the a-type dipole
moment is negligibly small in comparison to the b-type dipole
moment. Therefore, a-type transitions were neglected in the
analysis.

Figure 3: Example of the combined ﬁt performed by the
blended lines module (bottom in blue) in comparison with
separate ﬁts for each peak (top in red). The visible transi-
tions are the 72,6 ← 61,5 transitions for the (0, 1) and (1, 0)
internal rotation components. For the combined ﬁt, an ad-
ditional unknown peak at a lower frequency was included
and the widths of the three peaks were locked. The center
frequencies for each ﬁt are indicated by dotted lines in the
corresponding color and for the combined ﬁt, the two com-
ponents of interest are shown as dotted proﬁles. The center
frequencies of the separate ﬁt deviate by about 20 kHz, em-
phasizing the advantage of a combined ﬁt. For the analysis
of acetone it was fundamental to accurately determine the
splitting between (0, 1) and (1, 0) as well as between (1, 1)
and (1, 2). However, even at low frequencies, these transi-
tions overlap partly making a combined ﬁt indispensable.

blend can be selected. On the other hand, partly
blended lines can be resolved with the blended
lines module. It allows to ﬁt multiple peaks si-
multaneously and thereby determine an individual
center frequency for each transition. The widths
of the peaks can be independent or locked (e.g.,
if all peaks are from the same molecule and mea-
surement and therefore are expected to have the
same linewidth). Additionally, a baseline can be
subtracted in the form of a polynomial. In the ma-
jority of cases, this results in more accurate center
frequencies of partly blended transitions, see Fig. 3.
ii) The seriesﬁnder module allows to ﬁlter the
predictions and display them ordered by intensity.
Predeﬁned ﬁlters are present for the transition type,
the frequency range, and to hide already assigned
predictions. One major use case is ﬁnding the
strongest predicted, but so far unassigned transi-
tions in the frequency range of the experiment. For
convenience, the transitions can be chosen as the
reference series of the Loomis-Wood plot with a sin-
gle click.

iii) The peakﬁnder module ﬁnds peaks in the
real spectrum. The peaks are shown in the spec-

sion available on the PROSPE webpage10, e.g., the
maximum of transitions was increased from 8191
to 16383, the number of tunneling parameters per
state was increased from 37 to 199 and the num-
ber of predicted lines was increased from 50 000 to
1 000 000.

An inconvenience for the assignment process was
label switching [33–35], which occurred especially
for high J values. This behavior is described in ER-
HAM’s manual and appears due to oblate paired
transitions being degenerate. A random phase is
introduced to nonetheless diagonalize the matrix
which randomly spreads the intensity between two
allowed b-type transitions and two forbidden a-type
transitions. The a-type transitions were ﬁltered
out before ﬁtting the assigned lines. However, the
randomly spread intensity can inﬂuence the cen-
ter frequency of blends because LLWP automat-
ically sets the weight according to the intensity
from the *.cat ﬁle. This was corrected by manu-
ally setting the weights of aﬀected transitions. An-
other complication arose due to transitions aﬀected
by label switching changing between diﬀerent ﬁts.
Thus, certain transitions were not assigned in oth-
erwise assigned series (see unassigned transitions in
Fig. 2). Additionally, speciﬁc lines were excluded
from the ﬁt due to either poor signal-to-noise ratio
or being inseparably blended with unknown transi-
tions. However, the great majority of blends could
be treated with LLWP’s blended lines module (see
Fig. 3 and Sec. 3.3) or ERHAM’s blend functional-
ity.

Due to the high number of assignments, the un-
certainties were assigned automatically. A single
second derivative Voigt proﬁle was ﬁt to the exper-
imental spectrum for each assignment. The mean
deviation between the experimental and simulated
lineshape was calculated via the root mean square
(RMS). To normalize the deviation, this value was
divided by the amplitude A resulting in11

led to more assignments. Assigning with LLWP
was conﬁdent and eﬃcient as multiple trends were
visible in the LWPs. The two most used trends were
systematic deviation patterns (νobs − νcalc) for ad-
jacent rows and trends in typical patterns (see e.g.,
the typical triplet pattern becoming narrower with
increasing frequency in Fig. 2). These trends al-
lowed to conﬁdently assign transitions, even if they
showed strong deviations from the initial predic-
tions.

[15]

All literature transitions in the here measured
frequency range were reassigned, especially as
the transitions from Ordu et al.
for the
13C1-acetone isotopolog were misassigned above
200 GHz. For lower frequency areas that were
not measured here, literature data were used con-
sisting of 55 transitions in the frequency range
10–25 GHz [12]. Together with the here assigned
lines, this resulted in a total of 16208 transitions
with due to blends 8958 unique line frequencies, see
Tab. A.1 for the transition type coverage. Fits and
predictions were performed with a modiﬁed version
of ERHAM [31, 32]. Due to the size of the dataset,

resulted in a quantity, which incorporates the SNR,
the asymmetry of the line, and possible blends -
all being aspects that are taken into account when
assigning uncertainties manually. The calculated
RMS/A value was used to group the transitions into
three classes with uncertainties of 30 kHz, 50 kHz,
and 70 kHz.

Diﬀerent approaches were tested for the ﬁt. First,
a ﬁt was created step-by-step with a script that
added in every cycle the next best parameter to the
ﬁt. However, a better result was obtained by adding
whole sets of parameters at once and afterward re-
moving parameters with high relative uncertainties.

Up to 500 GHz, ﬁtting was straightforward. The
previous step-by-step ﬁt up to 500 GHz was used to
get an approximation for which orders of parame-
ters were needed. Except for fundamental param-

eters12, all other parameters were given an initial
value of zero. Diﬀerent sets of interaction param-
eters were tested. The resulting ﬁt includes 8125
transitions (5819 unique lines) with the covered
quantum numbers being shown in Fig. A.2a. The
WRMS is 1.14 and the highest parameter uncer-
tainty is about 11%, so all parameters were kept.
The resulting parameters are shown in Tab. 1 and
the residuals of the ﬁnal ﬁt are shown in Fig. A.3a.
For frequencies higher than 500 GHz, LLWP’s
residuals module was used to identify a group
of transitions with high quantum numbers that
showed strong deviations. The aﬀected transitions

with 94 > J 0 > 67 and K 0
a > 3 were excluded
from the ﬁnal ﬁt. Their deviation patterns look
similar to patterns caused by interactions but were
not further examined here (see Fig. A.3b). We ex-
pect more transitions with high quantum numbers
to be perturbed and thus the ﬁt to be eﬀective.
Consequentially, it should not be used for structure
determination. The resulting ﬁt up to 1100 GHz in-
cludes 12403 transitions (8602 unique lines) with a
quantum number coverage as shown in Fig. A.2b.
As with the previous ﬁt, sets of parameters were
added together, resulting in a ﬁt with many param-
eters having high uncertainties, some even greater
than 100%. Parameters were then omitted sym-
metrically for the two rotors. Their uncertainty and
inﬂuence on the goodness of the ﬁt were the two cri-
teria for choosing the next parameter to omit. This
allowed to reduce the number of parameters to 66
and improve the relative uncertainties. For the ﬁ-
nal ﬁt, the highest relative uncertainty is 17% and
only 2 parameters have uncertainties higher than
10%. The resulting WRMS is 1.45. The resulting
parameters are shown in Tab. 2 and the residuals
of the ﬁnal ﬁt are shown in Fig. A.3b.

5. Conclusion

Acknowledgements

The microwave spectrum of an enriched sample of
acetone-13C1 was recorded for the ﬁrst time. More
than 1 THz of high-resolution spectra were recorded
up to 1102 GHz. Previous analyses of the rotational
ground state were extended, with the number of
assigned transitions increasing by more than a fac-
tor of 100. The quantum number coverage was in-
= 44. Two ﬁts are
creased to J 00
presented. The ﬁt up to 500 GHz should be used for
structure determination as the ﬁt up to 1100 GHz
is expected to be eﬀective. The latter ﬁt allows for
astronomical searches up to the THz region, espe-
cially due to the high number of assigned lines, but
caution is required for the here excluded quantum
numbers above 500 GHz.

For the analysis, the new LLWP software was
used successfully. It raised the eﬃciency and conﬁ-
dence of assignments in the dense and complicated
spectrum. Additionally, LLWP facilitated the anal-
ysis by providing a multitude of important metrics.
Due to its general and unopinionated approach,
molecular ﬁngerprints of various molecules can be
analyzed in various frequency ranges.

LLWP is expected to speed up and facilitate the
assignment of many more complex molecular ﬁn-
gerprints in the future.

First, the GUI of LLWP is shown with multiple
columns (Fig. A.1) to highlight the possibilities that
this oﬀers. Next, diﬀerent important metrics of the
ﬁnal analyses are provided. The quantum number
coverage plots (Fig. A.2) of the two ﬁnal ﬁts give an
overview of the quantum numbers of the included
transitions. The residuals (Fig. A.3) and weighted
residuals (Fig. A.4) are a measure for the goodness
of the ﬁt and highlight the need to exclude speciﬁc
transitions with high deviations for the ﬁt up to
1100 GHz. Additionally, the assignments per tran-
sition type are displayed in Tab. A.1.

Figure A.1: The GUI of LLWP with multiple columns. Each component of the triplet from Fig. 2 is shown here in its own
column. Other typical use cases for multiple columns include simultaneously observing diﬀerent branches of infrared data or
comparisons of diﬀerent predictions.

lines). For the ﬁts, the a-type transitions were excluded as they are a product of label switching Sec. 4. An additional 225
lines were excluded for the ﬁt up to 1100 GHz (transitions with 94 > J 0 > 67 and K0
