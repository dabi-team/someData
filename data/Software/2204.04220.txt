ABSTRACT
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have gained considerable attention
in the past decades due to their astounding performance in different
applications, such as natural language modeling, self-driving assis-
tance, and source code understanding. With rapid exploration, more
and more complex DNN architectures have been proposed along
with huge pre-trained model parameters. The common way to use
such DNN models in user-friendly devices (e.g., mobile phones)
is to perform model compression before deployment. However,
recent research has demonstrated that model compression, e.g.,
model quantization, yields accuracy degradation as well as outputs
disagreements when tested on unseen data. Since the unseen data
always include distribution shifts and often appear in the wild, the
quality and reliability of quantized models are not ensured. In this
paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to characterize and help
users understand the behaviors of quantized models. Our study
considers 4 datasets spanning from image to text, 8 DNN architec-
tures including feed-forward neural networks and recurrent neural
networks, and 42 shifted sets with both synthetic and natural distri-
bution shifts. The results reveal that 1) data with distribution shifts
happen more disagreements than without. 2) Quantization-aware
training can produce more stable models than standard, adversar-
ial, and Mixup training. 3) Disagreements often have closer top-1
and top-2 output probabilities, and 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 is a better indicator
than the other uncertainty metrics to distinguish disagreements.
4) Retraining with disagreements has limited efficiency in remov-
ing disagreements. We opensource our code and models as a new
benchmark for further studying the quantized models.

1 INTRODUCTION
Thanks to the massively available data released and powerful hard-
ware devices supported, Deep Learning (DL) gains considerable
attention and achieves even better performance than humans on
some tasks [54]. As the backbone of DL systems, Deep Neural Net-
works (DNNs) follow the data-driven paradigm to learn knowledge
from the labeled data automatically and make predictions for in-
coming unlabelled ones. Inspired by the usage of DNNs for natural
language processing, researchers also employ DNNs for source
code-related tasks, e.g., code summarization [4] and problem classi-
fication [47]. Correspondingly, the behavior, quality, and security of
DNNs are also concerned by the software engineering community.
A factor that limits the application of DNNs is that DNNs are
large and require strong computing resources. For example, the
famous language prediction model GPT-3 [7] has 175 billion pa-
rameters, which is hard to be deployed in our daily used devices.
For code tasks, the recently released model GraphCodeBERT [20]
occupies 124M of storage memory, which is also difficult to be
plugged in the generally used IDEs. Furthermore, with the rapid
research progress, more and more complex DNNs are developed,
which makes the DNN deployment even more challenging.

To solve this deployment issue, instead of directly transferring
DNNs to devices, one typical process is to reduce the size of DNN
models by model compression for lighter and easier deployment.
There are different ways to perform model compression, e.g., model
pruning which removes useless parameters from the model, and

model quantization which degrades float-level parameters to lower-
level parameters (integer-level). In general, the compression process
is of great importance and should preserve the performance of
original models as much as possible. The reason is that after a model
is compressed, it is hard to change it when unexpected problems
occur. For example, retraining a model deployed on a mobile device
is impractical because this model is packaged.

Unfortunately, recent research has revealed two problems of
model compression. First, [22] shows that a compressed model
could have a big accuracy difference (more than 5%) compared to
its original model. Second [57, 60] demonstrate that it is common to
find inputs that trigger different predictions by a compressed model
and its original model. As these study reveal, it remains unclear to
what extent model compression preserves prediction performance
and under which conditions. The existing literature currently lacks
a detailed assessment of these conditions and this lack, in turn,
impedes the reliable application of compression techniques.

In this paper, we fill this gap and empirically characterize the
behavior of compressed models under various experimental set-
tings in order to better understand the limitations of compression
techniques. We specifically consider quantization as this approach
is mostly applied in practice [9]. We focus our study on the DL
models quantized by TensorFLowLite [3] and CoreML [55] which
are widely adopted in the industry. For example, Google uses Ten-
sorFLowLite for model deployment on Android devices and Apple
applies CoreML for IOS devices. In total, our experimental settings
include 4 datasets ranging from image to text, 8 different DNNs
including both Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Recur-
rent Neural Networks (RNNs), 42 different sets with both synthetic
and natural distribution shifts. With this material, we explore four
research questions that existing studies have overlooked:

RQ1: How do quantized models react to distribution shifts?
Real applications of DL systems often witness data distributions
shifts – changes in data distribution that typically cause drops in
model performance [35]. Given the practical predominance of this
phenomenon, research [5, 12, 30] has emphasized the need to con-
sider distribution shift when evaluating DL models. We, therefore,
study the impact of model quantization in the case of distribution
shifts. We evaluate the quantized models against two types of dis-
tribution shift datasets: synthetic (based on image transformations)
and natural (reported in the literature). We compare the original and
the quantized models in terms of accuracy difference and predicted
label differences, i.e. disagreements.

RQ2: How does the training strategy influence the behav-
ior of quantized models? We explore the influence of different
training strategies: standard training which is the basic way to
prepare pretrained model, quantization-aware training [33] which
is specifically designed for model quantization, adversarial training
[19] and mixup training [61], which are the commonly used data
augmentation training strategies. We apply each strategy to train
original models and then quantize these models. We compare the
pairs of models in terms of accuracy difference and disagreements.
RQ3: What are the characteristics of the data on which
original and quantized models disagree? We aim to find dis-
criminating factors that can help identify the disagreement inputs.
In particular, we investigate whether the most uncertain data are

the most likely to produce disagreements. Based on different un-
certainty metrics, we train simple classifiers based on logistic re-
gression and evaluate their capabilities to predict disagreements.

RQ4: Can model retraining reduce disagreements? We in-
vestigate whether retraining – a common approach to improve DL
models – can efficiently fix disagreements. Specifically, we explore
whether retraining the original model (for additional epochs) with
disagreement inputs can help preserve the knowledge of these in-
puts through the quantization process, and make the quantized
model classify these inputs correctly.

In summary, the main novel contributions of this paper are:
• We show that synthetic distribution shift has a significant impact
on quantized models; it increases the accuracy change by up to
3.03% and the percentage of disagreements by 5.28%.

• We empirically confirm that quantization-aware training is the
best method to alleviate performance loss and disagreements
after quantization, including when distribution shifts occur.
• We demonstrate that data uncertainty – as captured by the Mar-
gin metric – is a suitable factor to discriminate disagreement
data. A simple classifier based on Margin reaches an AUC-ROC
of 0.63 to 0.97.

• We illustrate that retraining on disagreement inputs does not
decrease the total level of disagreements between original and
quantized models, because it has the side effect of introducing
new disagreements.

We release all our code, models (before and after quantization)
and benchmarks in order to support future research studying and
improving model quantization1.

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Deep Learning
Deep learning [18] is a machine learning technique that uses inter-
mediate layers to progressively obtain knowledge from raw data,
and deep neural networks form the backbone of deep learning. A
typical deep neural network consists of an input layer, several hid-
den layers, and an output layer. Each layer includes neurons that
mimic the neurons in human brains and undertake specific com-
putations, such as sigmoid and rectifier. The connections between
successive layers establish the data flow. In brief, training a deep
neural network is to tune the parameters (importance of neurons)
of the connections, and testing is to ensure accuracy and reliability
during deployment in real-world applications.

2.2 Model Quantization
Model quantization is an optimization technique that aims at trans-
forming the higher-bit level weights to lower-bit level weights, e.g.,
from float32 weights to 8-bit integer weights, to reduce the size of
the model for an easy model deployment. Multiple quantization
approaches [32, 33, 38, 53] have been proposed given its impor-
tance in DL-based engineering. An important part of quantization
methods is the mapping between the two parts of weights. This
mapping can be constructed by using a simple linear function to
find the scale for two levels of weights, or by different clustering

metrics (e.g., k-means cluster used in CoreML) to find the lookup
table quantization of weights.

Figure 1: An example of weights quantization. Each weight
in Float32 format is converted into Int8.

Figure 1 gives an example of the basic linear quantization. We as-
sume the left side is the float32-level weights, and the range of these
weights is [-1, 1]. We plan to convert the float weights to 8-bit inte-
ger weights ranging in [-128, 127]. Thus, the 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒 here is 128 and
the quantized weights is calculated by 𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 (𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠𝑓 𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑡 /𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒).
Generally, to further reduce the memory usage of quantized models,
the quantization only keeps positive weights.

2.3 Distribution Shift
Distribution shift refers to the change of data distribution in the
test dataset compared to the training dataset. Generally, benchmark
datasets [36, 44] are designed to include training and test data fol-
lowing the same distribution. However, in real-world deployments,
the test data can be from the same or a different distribution, which
raises the security concern [5]. Generally speaking, there are two
types of distribution shifts, synthetic and natural [35].

Synthetic distribution shift considers possible perturbations in
the real world. In addition, concerning the severity of corruption,
data can have various levels of noise, which covers many different
situations. As a result, synthetic distribution shift is always taken
as a starting point to evaluate the performance of a DNN under
different settings. A wide range of visual corruptions has been
developed in the image domain [24, 46]. For example, adding motion
blur into an image can mimic the scenario of a moving object, and
inserting the fog effect can simulate the condition of foggy weather.
Differ from synthetic shift, natural distribution shift comes from
natural variations in datasets. For instance, in the widely used
text dataset, IMDb [44], data (movies reviews) are collected from
IMDb. When testing, the reviews can be from another movie review
website or from a different customer groups.

3 OVERVIEW
3.1 Study Design
Figure 2 gives an overview of our study. Following the common
DL systems development process, we prepare the original model
DNN by standard model training (Section 3.4) using the collected
datasets. Then, we use quantization techniques (e.g., TensorflowLite,
CoreML) to compress the model and prepare the optimized model
DNN’ for further deployment. Afterward, to study whether the
quantization is reliable or not, we prepare two types of test data,
the ID test set and OOD test set. Remark that the ID test set is
the original test data from each dataset, which is in distribution
compared to the training data. The OOD test set is the data with

distribution shifts. We compare the performance of the original
DNN and compressed DNN’ on these two types of test sets and
check the differences to answer RQ1. In our study, we consider two
types of distribution shifts, synthetic and natural.

In the development phase, in addition to standard training, other
training strategies can be used to prepare pre-trained models. Thus,
it is essential to explore the potential factor that could influence
the behaviors of quantized models – training strategy. We utilize
3 additional training strategies to train the original models and
then analyze the behaviors of the quantized model to answer RQ2.
Specifically, we include quantization-aware training [33], which is
specifically designed for solving the problem of accuracy decline
after quantization, adversarial training [19] and Mixup training
[61] which aim to improve the generalization of a DNN model.

After analyzing the behaviors of quantized models, we obtain
multiple models that are waiting for repair with their disagreements.
Before trying to remove the disagreements and repair the quantized
models, the first step should be to investigate the properties of the
data that cause disagreements between DNN and DNN’. We utilize
the uncertainty metric as an indicator to check if it can represent
the properties of disagreements and answer RQ3. Specifically, for
each test dataset (ID/OOD) and model, we collect all the disagree-
ments that have at least once been predicted differently by the
original model and the quantized model. Then, we randomly select
the same number as the disagreements of normal inputs where the
predictions before and after quantization are consistent. Afterward,
we obtain the output probabilities of these two (disagreements and
normal inputs) sets and calculate their uncertainty scores by differ-
ent uncertainty metrics as the input data of the logistic regression
classifier. We assign the label of disagreement and normal input as
1 and 0, respectively. We then combine and shuffle the two sets and
split them into training data and test data following the ratio 9:1.
Finally, we train the classifier using the training data and calculate
the AUC-ROC score of the classifiers using the prediction of test
data with a threshold of 95%. The AUC-ROC score is used to de-
termine the best uncertainty metric that is discriminative between
disagreements and normal inputs significantly.

Finally, we make the first step to repair the quantized model
for reliable model deployment. We verify if model retraining is
helping to alleviate disagreements to answer RQ4. Model retraining
is the most straightforward and commonly used method during
deployment to specifically let a pre-trained model work on unlearnt
features [27]. However, its effectiveness on model quantization is
uncovered. After retraining, we follow the same procedure as RQ1
to produce the quantized model and check if the disagreements
decreased. Remarkably, we consider both the existing and newly
generated disagreements.

3.2 Datasets and Models
Table 1 presents the details of datasets and models. In this study,
we consider 4 widely studied datasets over image and text domains.
For each dataset, we build two different models. More specifically,
MNIST [36] is a gray-scale image dataset containing digit numbers
from 0 to 9. We train LeNet-1 and LeNet-5 from the LeNet [36]
family. CIFAR-10 contains color images of airplanes and birds. For
this dataset, we build two models, Network in network (NiN) [40]

except 8-bit integer quantization for RNNs [1]. In our experiments,
we only apply 16-bit float quantization for IMDb-related models.
CoreML [55] is an Apple framework that converts models from
third-party frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow and Pytorch) to Mlmodel.
Mlmodel is a specific deep learning model format for IOS platforms.
CoreML also provides post-training quantization interfaces to com-
press models. Differ from TensorflowLite, CoreML supports all bits
level quantization for all types of DNNs.

and ResNet-20 [23]. iWildCam is a dataset from the distribution
shift benchmark Wilds [35]. It consists of color images of different
animals, e.g., cow, wild horse, and giraffe. We follow the recommen-
dation of the benchmark to build ResNet-50 [23] for iWildCam and
add one more model, DenseNet-121 [31], in our study. IMDb [44]
is a text dataset collected from the popular movie review website
IMDb. This dataset is mainly used for sentiment analysis, i.e., the
reviewer holds a positive or negative opinion in a movie. We build
two well-known RNN models, LSTM [26] and GRU [11], for IMDb.
Test data with distribution shift. For synthetic distribution
shift, we test on MNIST and CIFAR-10 with benchmark datasets
MNIST-C [46] and CIFAR-10-C [24], respectively. Both benchmarks
include several groups of noisy images synthesized by different
image transformation methods, e.g., image rotation and image scale.
MNIST-C contains 16 types of transformations and CIFAR-10-C
has 19 types. For natural distribution shift, we test on iWildCam
and IMDb using the Wilds benchmark. The distribution shift comes
from the change of camera traps in iWildCam and the difference in
websites and customers in IMDb.

3.3 Quantization Techniques
TensorflowLite [3] is a component of the deep learning framework
– TensorFlow, which is developed and maintained by Google. It
provides interfaces to covert TensorFlow models into Lite models to
promote the deployment in different low-computing devices, such
as Android mobile phones. Currently, TensorFLowLite supports
both 8-bit integer and 16-bit float quantizations for most DNNs

3.4 Training Strategies
In addition to standard training, we consider three representative
training strategies from different perspectives, quantization-aware
[33], adversarial [19], and Mixup [61].

Standard training is the baseline to evaluate the other training
strategies. In this setting, we train the model without any modifica-
tion in the model (e.g., quantization-aware) or data (e.g., Mixup).

Quantization-aware training is designed by the TensorFlow
group, which is used for preserving the accuracy of the model after
post-training quantization in the training process. It simulates the
quantization effects in the forward pass of training. Namely, during
training, the parameters of the model will be updated by both the
normal operations and the injected quantization operations. In this
way, the trained model can learn the knowledge for quantization.
Adversarial training is one of the most effective defenses for
promoting model robustness by adversarially data augmentation.
Compared to standard training, adversarial examples crafted from
raw inputs are fed to train the model during each epoch. As a result,
the training dataset is augmented successively.

Mixup training is a data augmentation technique that gener-
ates new samples by weighted combinations of random training
data and their labels. It has been empirically proved to be effective
in improving the generalization of DNNs and has several variants,
such as AugMix [25]. In this paper, we consider the original Mixup.

3.5 Evaluation Measures
We consider both the accuracy and disagreement to evaluate
the performance of DNNs, and use AUC-ROC to evaluate the
performance of logistic regression classifiers.

Accuracy is the basic criterion to quantify the quality of a DNN

model, which refers to the ratio of correct predictions.

Number of disagreements is defined in [60] to characterize
the difference between two DNNs. A disagreement is an input that
triggers different outputs by the original model and its quantized
version. By measuring the number of disagreements in the test data,
one can observe the model’s behavior change after quantization.
Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
(AUC-ROC) [13] is a threshold-independent performance evalu-
ation metric. In RQ3, we utilize AUC-ROC score to measure the
performance of the trained logistic regression classifiers.

3.6 Uncertainty Metrics
In RQ3, we utilize uncertainty metrics to estimate the characteris-
tics of the disagreement inputs. Following previous studies [28, 43],
we select 4 commonly used output-based uncertainty metrics in
our study. Given a classification task, let 𝐷𝑁 𝑁 be a 𝐶-class model
and 𝑥 be an input. 𝑝𝑖 (𝑥) denotes the predicted probability of 𝑥
belonging to the 𝑖th class, 0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝐶. Entropy score [52] quan-
tifies the uncertainty of 𝑥 by Shannon entropy: 𝐸𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑦 (𝑥) = -
(cid:205)𝐶
𝑝𝑖 (𝑥) log 𝑝𝑖 (𝑥). Gini [14] score is calculated as: 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖 (𝑥) =
𝑖=1
1 − (cid:205)𝐶
𝑖=1 (𝑝𝑖 (𝑥))2. 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 [58] score is based on the top-2 pre-
diction probabilities: 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛(𝑥) = 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 (𝑥) = 𝑝𝑘 (𝑥) − 𝑝 𝑗 (𝑥),
(𝑝𝑖 (𝑥)). Least Con-
(𝑝𝑖 (𝑥)) and 𝑗 = arg max
where 𝑘 = arg max
𝑖={1:𝐶 }/𝑘

𝑖=1:𝐶

fidence (LC) [51] score is the difference between the most con-
fident prediction and 100% confidence. 𝐿𝐶 (𝑥) = 1 - 𝑝𝑘 (𝑥), where
𝑘 = arg max

(𝑝𝑖 (𝑥)).

𝑖=1:𝐶

4 CONFIGURATION
Environments. We undertake model training and retraining on an
NVIDIA Tesla V100 16G SXM2 GPU. For the TensorFlowLite model
evaluation, we run experiments on a 2.6 GHz Intel Xeon Gold 6132
CPU. For the CoreML model evaluation, we conduct experiments
on a MacBook Pro laptop with macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 with a 2GHz
GHz QuadCore Intel Core i5 CPU with 16GB RAM.

Quantization. We apply the interfaces provided by Tensor-
FLowLite and CoreML to accomplish post-training model quantiza-
tion. For IMDb-related models, we only apply 16-bit float quantiza-
tion by TensorFlowLite and utilize both 8-bit interger and 16-bit
float quantization by CoreML. For other models, we conduct 8-bit
integer and 16-bit float quantization using both techniques.

Model training. For the quantization-aware training, we mask
layers (e.g., BatchNormalization layer) that are not supported by
the current TensorFlow framework. In addition, since TensorFlow
does not support RNNs [2], we skip IMDb-related models in this
experiment. Regarding the adversarial training, we employ the com-
monly used PGD-based [45] adversarial training for image datasets,
and PWWS-based [48] adversarial training for text datasets. Con-
cerning the Mixup training, we follow the recommendation by the
original paper to set the mixup parameter 𝛼 as 0.2.

Model retraining. Following the same setting from the empiri-
cal study of model retraining [27], we add all disagreements into
original training data to train the pre-trained model with additional
several epochs (5 epochs for MNIST, IMDb, and iWildsCam, 10
epochs for CIFAR-10).

All the detailed configurations can be found at our project site 1.

5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, we report the experimental results to answer each
research question. Meanwhile, we highlight our novel findings.

5.1 RQ1: Behavior of Quantized Models
Table 2 presents the results of the behaviors of quantized models
on ID test data and OOD test data with synthetic distribution shifts.
Concerning the accuracy change, the accuracy is supposed to de-
grade due to the loss of information during quantization, which
is also demonstrated by the existing studies [22, 28]. Surprisingly,
the results also show almost 30% of (86 out of 292) opposite cases
where quantized models hold higher accuracy than their original
models. Particularly, in the case of 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑁 𝑒𝑡20, 𝑍𝑜𝑜𝑚_𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑟 , the quan-
tized model has an improvement of 1.98%. On the other hand, this
phenomenon also happens to the natural distribution shift (10 out
of 16 cases in Table 3). Regarding shifted data as natural adversarial
examples, our finding confirms the conclusion from a recent re-
search [15] that the quantization process can be useful to promote
the model’s adversarial robustness. In addition, the distribution
shift can lead to larger change and should be taken into account
during deployment. For example, in MNIST, TF-8, the quantized
model has an accuracy change of 0.04% on ID test data but 0.78
under the Fog shift (Table 2). And comparing the ID and OOD test
sets, we found the synthetic distribution shift can increase the ac-
curacy change by up to 3.03% (ResNet20-Gaussian_noise-CM-8).
Finding 1: Post-training model quantization does not always harm
the accuracy of original models. Distribution shift can cause a large
accuracy change compared to testing on ID data.

Concerning the disagreement, even if the quantized model main-
tains accuracy, there may exist disagreements. For example, in the
case of LeNet1, CM-8, the accuracy change is 0, but the number
of disagreements is 6. Even worse, in DenseNet-121, CM-16, 216
disagreements appear without any accuracy change. This calls for
the attention that the behaviors of quantized models can not be
exactly reflected by only comparing the test accuracy. Thus, during
deployment, using accuracy only to evaluate the quality and relia-
bility of quantized DNNs is insufficient. Finding 2: Disagreements
may exist even if quantized models maintain the accuracy.

Moreover, comparing the number of disagreements from the ID
test data and OOD test data, we observe that the distribution shift
tends to lead to more disagreements. In 82% cases (241 of 294), the
number of disagreements from OOD test data is greater than from
ID test data, the difference can be by up to 5.28% (LeNet1, Fog, TF-8).
However, after the model has been deployed and used in the wild,
test data are more likely to have distribution shifts which raises a
big concern that model quantization may bring unexcepted errors.
Finding 3: Model quantization is sensitive to the distribution shift
where more disagreements happen.

predict 188 more data than TensorFlowLite-quantized model, which
is a considerable difference. In 8-bit integer quantization, CoreML
can still outperform TensorFlowLite in most cases (4 out of 6). Ad-
ditionally, we found an extreme case (iWildCam, DensetNet-121)
where the accuracy of quantized models by both techniques drops
a lot. This finding raises the concern that both quantization tools
have room for improvement and require a thorough test. On the
other hand, concerning the number of disagreements, the models
quantized by CoreML have fewer disagreement inputs than those
by TensorFlowLite in most cases (13 out of 14). Finding 4: In post-
training model quantization, compared to TensorFlowLite, CoreML
maintains the accuracy better as well as causes fewer disagree-
ments.

Answer to RQ1: Under synthetic distribution shift, the accuracy
change and number of disagreements between the original and
quantized models increase by up to 3.03% and 5.28%. Regardless
of the dataset, DNN, and distribution shift, CoreML keeps the
behaviors of original DNNs better than TensorFlowLite during
deployment.

5.2 RQ2: Influence of Training Strategy
In this section, we explore how different training strategies influ-
ence the behaviors of quantized models. Due to the space limita-
tion, we only report the results of one model from each dataset
(MNIST-LeNet5, CIFAR-10-ResNet20, IMDb-LSTM, and iWildsCam-
ResNet50). The whole results are available at our project site.

tribution shift. Non-highlighted value: accuracy change (%),

indicates a small difference between the original and quan-
tized models. ID refers to the ID test data and the others are

Next, we compare the two quantization techniques concerning
the accuracy change. On average, regardless of the dataset, DNN,
and quantization level, CoreML produces more stable quantized
models (smaller change) than TensorFlowLite in most cases (12
out of 14). Concretely, in 16-bit float quantization, CoreML always
outperforms TensorFlowLite. Take iWildCam, DenseNet-121 as an
example, in 16-bit level quantization, the average accuracy change
is 0.27% by TensorFlowLite but only 0.02% by CoreML. This differ-
ence 0.25% could cause the CoreML-quantized model to correctly

test datasets, and the others are OOD test datasets. QA: quantization-aware training. Adv: adversarial training. Mixup: Mixup
training. 𝑦−axis: the difference of the number of disagreements between a training strategy and the standard training.

First, we evaluate the performance of each training strategy
concerning the distribution shift before model quantization. Figure
3 shows the results. Under synthetic distribution shift, for MNIST,
there are 12, 5, 6 cases out of 17 that using quantization-aware,
adversarial, and Mixup training, respectively, improve the accuracy
compared to using standard training. While the result for CIFAR-10
changes to 5, 8, and 12 cases of 20 correspondingly. We conclude that
none of these three training strategies can consistently deal with the
issue of accuracy degradation under synthetic distribution shifts. On
the other hand, under natural distribution shift, interestingly, when
performing adversarial training for IMDb models, the accuracy
of models on both distribution shifted datasets (𝐶𝑅 and 𝑌𝑒𝑙𝑝) has
been improved. We conjecture that the features of text adversarial
examples are more likely to appear in the OOD test dataset. For
example, the original sentence "a wonderful...are terribly well done
and its adversarial sentence "a wonderful...are terribly considerably
perform" only have two-word difference, but the model predicts
differently. We found that the words considerably and perform are
both in the vocabulary of OOD data. For iWildCam, only the Mixup
training can improve the accuracy of models on shifted data. Find-
ing 5: Concerning the accuracy, none of the three (quantization-
aware, adversarial, Mixup) training strategies has a significant ad-
vantage over standard training before quantization.

Second, we check the accuracy change of each model trained
by different training strategies after quantization. Table 4 presents
the results of the average accuracy change of all test datasets of
each model. Compared to standard training, the quantized models
by using the quantization-aware training are more stable where
the accuracy change in most cases (10 out of 12) is the same as or
smaller. For example, in CIFAR-10, CM-8, by standard training, the
quantized model has an average of 0.89% difference compared to
its original model. However, by quantization-aware training, the

Table 4: Average accuracy change (%) of models by quantiza-
tion. The average is of 17, 20, 3, and 2 test datasets of MNIST,
CIFAR-10, IMDb, and iWildCam, respectively. A low average
value indicates a small difference between the original and
quantized models. Highlighted values indicate that the ac-
curacy change by the corresponding training strategy is the
same as or smaller than by standard training. TF: Tensor-
FlowLite. CM: CoreML. Baseline: standard training.

difference can decline to only 0.05%. By contrast, both adversarial
and Mixup training can result in more stable (11 out of 15, 8 out
of 15 cases) quantized models than standard training but not as
well as quantization-aware training. In short, quantization-aware
training outperforms adversarial and Mixup training concerning
minimizing the accuracy change during deployment.

In addition, similar to the findings in RQ1, we observe that under
synthetic distribution shift (MNIST and CIFAR-10), most (7 out
of 8) of the accuracy change improvements happen in the models
quantized by TensorFlowLite. And for the data with natural dis-
tribution shifts, the accuracy change increase only happens in the
models quantized by CoreML. Finding 6: In terms of accuracy
change, quantization-aware training produces more stable models

than standard, adversarial, and Mixup training. During deployment,
TensorFlowLite is more suitable to deal with natural distribution
shift, while CoreML performs better for synthetic distribution shift.
Finally, we check the disagreements that occur during model
quantization. Figure 4 shows disagreement change of models trained
by different strategies compared to by the standard training. Given
all OOD test datasets, the quantization-aware equipped with Ten-
sorFlowLite can efficiently decrease the number of disagreements.
Under synthetic distribution shift only, after TensorFlowLite quan-
tization, the models trained by Mixup training happen more dis-
agreements. On the other hand, under natural distribution shift, all
these tree training strategies are useful to reduce disagreements
(negative disagreement change in Figures 4(e) - 4(h)) regardless
of the quantization technique. Finding 7: Under synthetic dis-
tribution shift, quantization-aware training is useful to remove
disagreements for TensorFlowLite-quantized models. While under
natural distribution shift, all three training strategies are efficient
to reduce disagreements.

Answer to RQ2: Generally, quantization-aware training can
produce more stable models with small accuracy changes and
fewer disagreements after model quantization. For data with
natural distribution shifts, both quantization-aware training and
basic data augmentation training (adversarial training and Mixup
training) can reduce the disagreements.

5.3 RQ3: Characteristic of Disagreements
To understand which data are likely to cause disagreements during
quantization, we explore the data properties based on the output
uncertainty. The intuition is that the disagreements are those close
to the decision boundary of the model [60]. Concretely, after quan-
tization, the decision boundary of a model may slightly move due
to the precision of parameter change. As a result, the data that are
close to the boundary might cross over the boundary and cause
disagreements. Generally, those data are uncertain to the model.
Many uncertainty metrics have been developed but which one can
be used to more precisely distinguish the disagreements and normal
inputs is unclear. In our study, we consider four (Entropy, Margin,
Gini, Least Confidence) widely used uncertainty metrics only based
on the output of the model to determine the best one to present the
property of disagreements.

Figure 5 gives an example (CIFAR-10, ResNet20) of the distribu-
tion of uncertainty scores of the disagreements and normal inputs.
First of all, regardless of the uncertainty metric, the result confirms
that disagreements are more uncertain for a model than normal
inputs as they usually have higher (lower in Margin) uncertainty
scores. Take the least confidence as an example, most normal in-
puts have LC scores near 0. According to the definition of LC (in
Equation (??)), the result demonstrates that the model is confident
(with almost 100%) in the top-1 predictions for these inputs. In
detail, the number of inputs having LC scores in the ranges of [0,
0.2], (0.2, 0.4], (0.4, 0.6], (0.6, 0.8], and (0.8, 1] are 462, 31, 7, 0, and 0
respectively. In contrast, for the disagreement inputs, most of them
have high uncertain scores. Specifically, the number of inputs that
the LC scores in the ranges of [0, 0.2], (0.2, 0.4], (0.4, 0.6], (0.6, 0.8],
and (0.8, 1] are 110, 175, 225, 26, and 0 respectively. Finding 8:

(a) Entropy

(b) Margin

(c) Gini

(d) Least Confidence

Figure 5: An example (CIFAR-10, ResNet20, ID test data) of
the distributions of output uncertainty scores. Red: disagree-
ments. Blue: normal inputs.

Output-based uncertainty is a promising indicator to distinguish
disagreements and normal inputs.

Table 5 presents the AUC-ROC scores of the classifiers. Regard-
less of the dataset, DNN, and training strategy, in most cases (27
out of 30), the classifiers trained by 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 score have greater
AUC-ROC scores than other classifiers, which means that the dis-
agreement inputs and normal inputs have a bigger difference based
on the 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 score. Specifically, in 23 (out of 30) cases, the classi-
fiers trained using 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 score as the training data have greater
than 90% AUC-ROC scores, which indicates the classifiers are useful
to distinguish the normal inputs and disagreements. Besides, most
IMDb classifiers have 100% AUC-ROC scores, the perfect results
could come from the limited number of disagreements but can still
prove the output-based uncertainty score is a promising indicator
to represent the property of disagreements.

Figure 5 also shows a few disagreements where the model has
high confidence. We call them extreme disagreements. We uti-
lize the 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 score to set the threshold and analyze how many
extreme disagreements exist and where do they come from. Con-
cretely, we define the disagreements with 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 > 0.95 as extreme.
We observe that there are 3, 226, 0, and 9 extreme disagreements
in MNIST, CIFAR-10, IMDb, and iWildsCam, respectively. Interest-
ingly, all the extreme disagreements come from the disagreements
between TensorFlowLite-8bit quantized model and the original
model, which means this quantization moves the decision bound-
ary a lot in some areas. A deeper analysis could be an interesting
research direction. Finding 9: Extreme disagreements where the
original model has high prediction confidences only come from
TensorFlowLite-8bit quantized models.

Answer to RQ3: Most disagreements have closer top-1 and top-
2 output probabilities (i.e., smaller 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 score) than normal
inputs. Compared to Entropy, Gini and Least Confidence, Margin
is a better metric to distinguish disagreements and normal inputs.

5.4 RQ4: Effectiveness of Retraining
In RQ3, we observe that the disagreements are data where the
model has low confidence in the prediction. We investigate if model
retraining, an efficient method to improve confidence, can ensure a
stable compressed model during quantization.

Table 6 presents the number of disagreements from the ID test
data before and after model retraining. In most cases (18 out of 26
cases that have disagreements before retraining), the number of
disagreements decreases after model retraining. However, surpris-
ingly, there are some exceptions that the disagreements increase.
For example, in MNIST, LeNet1, CoreML-8, 6 more disagreements
appear after retraining. Finding 10: Retraining the model using
disagreements cannot always remove the disagreements.

In addition, we study whether the disagreements are really re-
moved by model retraining. To this end, we compare if the dis-
agreements maintain the same after retraining. For simplicity, we

define the stubborn disagreement as the disagreement appearing
both before and after retraining, and new disagreement as the dis-
agreement introduced by retraining. Figure 6 gives two examples of
stubborn disagreements. For the MNIST image, the model predicts
the digital number as 0 or 9, while the true label is 8. For the CIFAR-
10 image, the model hesitates to predict the animal to be a cat before
retraining, and raises the confidence of this wrong prediction after
retraining, while the true label is deer. Besides, we observe that the
average 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 score of all the stubborn disagreements before and

Hu and Guo, et al.

after retraining are 0.40 and 0.56, respectively. That means although
models become more confident with these stubborn disagreements
after retraining, their uncertainty is still high. In Table 6, regardless
of the quantization technique, only a few stubborn disagreements
remain after retraining. For example, in CIFAR-10, NiN, only 47 (of
540) disagreements are left. However, model retraining introduces
new disagreements which have the same size as without retraining.
For example, in iWildCam, ResNet50, through retraining, only 24
stubborn disagreements are left and all the other 445 are efficiently
removed, but meanwhile, 438 new disagreements appear. Finding
11: Through model retraining, only a few stubborn disagreements
remain but a similar size of new disagreements are introduced.

Answer to RQ4: Retraining fails to reduce the total number
of disagreements. Though it manages to remove some existing
disagreements, it introduces as many new ones.

6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Quantized Model Repair
We have verified that model retraining, the most common strategy
to enhance performance, has limited functionality in removing dis-
agreements. How to solve this issue is still an open problem. Based
on our investigation, the disagreements are mainly the data with
small 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 scores by quantized models. Therefore, the main chal-
lenge is how to improve the confidence of the data. We provide two
potential solutions. 1) Online monitoring. Before quantization,
training multiple models to perform prediction can also improve
confidence [6]. Concretely, we can divide data into different groups
based on their 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 scores. For each group of data, a model
is trained and quantized. 2) Offline repair. After quantization,
building an ensemble model to perform prediction instead of the
quantized model. Ensemble learning [37, 50] has been proved to
effectively improve the predictive performance of a single model by
taking weighted average confidence from multiple models. How-
ever, both solutions will increase the storage size since more models
are required. As a result, there is a trade-off between fewer disagree-
ments and efficient model quantization. Thus, designing a robust
quantization method is still an ongoing and important direction.

6.2 Threats to Validity
First, the threats to validity come from the selected datasets and
models. Regarding the datasets, we consider both image and text
classification tasks and include OOD benchmark datasets with both
synthetic and natural distribution shifts. All the datasets are widely
used in previous studies. As for the models, we cover two types
of DNN architectures, feed-forward neural network, e.g., ResNet,
and recurrent neural network, e.g., LSTM. In addition, we take into
account the model complexity and apply both simple and complex
ones, such as LeNet1 and ResNet50. For each dataset, we employ
two different models to eliminate the influence of selected models.
An interesting research direction is to repeat our experiments on
other tasks, such as the regression task.

Second, the training strategies and uncertainty metrics could
be other threats to validity. For the training strategies, among all
possible choices, we include the four most representative and com-
mon ones. Standard training is the most basic training procedure

and should be taken as the baseline. Quantization-aware training
is specifically designed for quantization. Mixup training is the first
and basic data augmentation approach to improve the generaliza-
tion of DNNs over different distribution shifts. Adversarial training
is one of the most effective techniques to promote model robust-
ness/generalization. For the uncertainty metrics, we tend to select
metrics that require as few configurations as possible. The four
metrics included in this work are all solely based on the output
probabilities. This is to avoid the impact of uncontrollable factors.
For example, the dropout-based uncertainty metric [16] needs to
consider where to put the dropout layer and the dropout ratio.

7 RELATED WORK
7.1 Deep Learning Testing
As a critical phase in the software development life cycle [41], deep
learning testing ensures the functionality of DL-based systems
during deployment. Multiple testing methods have been proposed
in recent years [17, 29, 34, 56, 62]. For example, from the perspective
of deep learning models, Pei et al. proposed DeepXplore which
borrows the idea from code coverage and defines neuron coverage
to measure if the test set is enough or not. Later on, DeepGauge [42]
defines some new coverage metrics, e.g., k-multisection Neuron
Coverage and Neuron Boundary Coverage, and demonstrates their
effectiveness compared to the basic neuron coverage. From the
perspective of test data, several test generation [12, 21, 49, 59] and
test selection [8, 14, 39] approaches have been proposed. Gao et
al. proposed SENSEI [17] which utilizes genetic search to find the
best image transformation methods (e.g., image rotate) to generate
the suitable data for training a more robust model. Chen et al.
proposed PACE [8] which uses clustering methods and MMD-critic
algorithm to select a small size of test data to estimate the accuracy
of the model. However, all of these works test the model before
quantization, while our study mainly focuses on the analysis of the
difference between the models before and after quantization.

There are two studies closely related to our work [57, 60]. Both
of them generate test inputs that have a different output between
the original and compressed models. However, these works did not
1) study the properties of such disagreements; 2) try to solve the
disagreements; 3) consider natural distribution shift, all of which
are considered in our work.

7.2 Empirical Study for Deep Learning Systems
Empirical software engineering is one general way to practical
analyze software systems. In recent years, multiple empirical studies
for deep learning systems have been conducted to help understand
such complex systems.

The empirical study by Zhang et al. [63] pointed out that model
migration is one of the top-three common programming issues in
developing deep learning applications. Noticing the lack of bench-
mark understanding of the migration and quantization, Guo et
al. [22] investigated, for deployment process, the performance of
trained models when migrated/quantized to real mobile and web
browsers. They focus on the impacts of the deployment process
on prediction accuracy, time cost, and memory consumption. In
addition to the accuracy, we further evaluate the robustness of a

model, especially considering the synthetic and natural distribu-
tion shifts in the test data. Chen et al. [10] studied the faults when
deploying deep learning models on mobile devices. Especially, they
apply TensorFlowLite and CoreML in the deployment, which is also
considered in our study. The difference with our study is that their
empirical study explores the failures related to data preparation
(datatype error), memory issue, dependency resolution error, and
so on, while our study focuses on the differential behavior during
deployment and retraining. Hu et al. [28] verified that model quan-
tization has opposite impacts over different tasks in the setting of
active learning. For example, after quantization, the model is less
accurate in the image classification task while exhibiting better
performance in the text classification task. In our study, since the
labels of all data are available, we apply standard training instead
of active learning.

8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we conducted a systematically study to characterize
and help people understand the behaviors of quantized models
under different data distributions. Our results reveal that there are
more disagreement inputs in data with distribution shift than in the
original test data. Quantization-aware training is a useful training
strategy to produce a model that has fewer disagreements after
quantization. The disagreements are those data that have high un-
certainty scores, and the 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 score is a more effective indicator
to distinguish the normal inputs and disagreements. More impor-
tantly, we also demonstrated that the commonly used approach –
retraining the model with disagreements has limited usefulness to
remove the disagreements and repair quantized models. Based on
our findings, we provide two future research directions to solve the
disagreement issue. To support further research, we released our
code, models (before and after quantization) to be a new benchmark
for studying the quantization problem.
