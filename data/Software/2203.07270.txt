ABSTRACT

Composite Higgs models usually contain additional pseudo Nambu Goldstone
bosons and vector-like quarks. We discuss various aspects related to their LHC
phenomenology and provide summary plots of exclusion limits using currently
available information. We also describe a general parametrisation implemented
in a software for Monte Carlo simulations and study the SU (5)/SO(5) scenario
as a concrete example.

1 Executive summary

Models of electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking by a composite Higgs [1] with partial com-
positeness [2] in the top-quark sector give promising solutions to the hierarchy problem [3–7]
of the Standard Model (SM). At the eﬀective ﬁeld theory level they can be described by
specifying the pattern of symmetry breaking involved. Generically these models predict the
existence of light scalars in addition to the Higgs boson, all emerging as pseudo Nambu-
Goldstone bosons (pNGBs). Partial compositeness also implies the presence of vector-like
quarks (VLQs). This proliferation of new particles requires a systematic approach to study
this class of models and to facilitate a seamless transition between theory, data, and simu-
lation codes.

Current experimental analyses already allow to set limits on the masses of such particles
in speciﬁc scenarios depending on their interactions. For pNGBs, we provide an overview
plot of the limits for pair production cross-sections times branching ratios in various ﬁnal
states (Fig. 2). We also work out a concrete example based on the SU (5)/SO(5) coset
(Fig. 7). For VLQs, we emphasize the relevance of their exotic decays by presenting a plot
summarizing current limits in the VLQ mass versus pNGB mass plane (Fig. 4).

Furthermore, we provide a general parametrisation describing the interactions of the new
particles arising in composite scenarios, which can be used for phenomenological studies and
is implemented in a numerical model for Monte Carlo simulations [8]. A software toolbox
of a new kind is also being developed, FSMOG (FeynRules plugin for Simpliﬁed MOdel
Generation) [9], to automatize the construction of the most general interaction Lagrangian
given a speciﬁc particle content, which has a much wider range of applications beyond the
realm of composite Higgs models.

2 Composite Higgs and partial compositeness: an outline

There are many approaches to strongly-coupled EW symmetry breaking scenarios [4–7].
The most investigated ones include, e.g., 5D holographic theories [10] and multi-site de-
constructed models like Little Higgs models [11]. Instead of using the holographic duality,
we consider directly a class of composite Higgs models based on 4D asymptotically free
(hypercolor) gauge theories. We assume that the hypercolor theory, after going through
a near conformal running [12, 13], conﬁnes at the multi-TeV scale. To include top partial
compositeness, its fundamental degrees of freedom contain fermionic matter in two inequiv-
alent irreducible representations (irreps) of hypercolor [14, 15], chosen in order to sequester
the EW coset from the composite states carrying QCD color.

The strong sector is associated with a global symmetry G that breaks spontaneously to
a subgroup H below the conﬁnement scale, such that the SM gauge symmetry is con-
tained in the unbroken subgroup H. The symmetry breaking pattern induced by the
fermionic condensates gives rise to an EW coset containing the Higgs boson as a pNGB.
The three minimal cosets arising from real, pseudoreal and complex irreps, containing at
least a pNGB Higgs doublet and preserving custodial symmetry, are SU (5)/SO(5) [16, 17]
(real), SU (4)/Sp(4) [18, 19] (pseudoreal), and SU (4) × SU (4)(cid:48)/SU (4)D [20, 21] (complex),
respectively. Holographic/little Higgs constructions, reviewed in [4] and [11], lead to ad-
ditional cosets, for instance the well-known minimal model SO(5)/SO(4) (MCHM) [3] or
SO(6)/SO(4) × SO(2) [22]. Most of the low energy phenomenology discussed here is also
applicable to this wider variety of models. Below the condensation scale, the colored VLQs
originate from the trilinear fermionic operators combining the two irreps in a hypercolor
invariant way. They are assumed to mix linearly with the SM quarks of the third generation
through partial compositeness. We do not review these constructions here but refer to the
existing literature: see [14, 15] for the initial constructions (a streamlined classiﬁcation can
be found in [23]). Additional models of this type are presented in [17, 24–32].

Composite Higgs models have two major types of experimental signatures in the low
energy range. First, the pNGB nature of the Higgs boson implies modiﬁcations of its
couplings with the other SM particles [33–37]. The other kind of signature involves addi-
tional particles beyond the SM (BSM), predicted by these models, for example, exotic EW
pNGBs [23,38–40], colored pNGBs [39,41], VLQs [42–48] and other colored fermionic states
in non-triplet irreps [49], vector resonances [50–54], and axion-like particles [55, 56]. In this
contribution we focus on EW pNGBs and exotic decay modes of VLQs.

To construct the low energy theory [57, 58] involving the pNGBs of the EW sector,
the VLQs, and the SM quarks and gauge bosons one must choose a symmetry breaking
pattern G/H, VLQs in H irreps, and an embedding of the SM quarks into an irrep of G,
see [6, 42, 59–61] for detailed constructions.

2.1 A general parametrisation

Here and in the appendix we present the generic Lagrangian, focusing on the interactions of
the pNGBs and the VLQs. At this stage we only use invariance under the electromagnetic
U (1)em and the QCD color SU (3)c to construct the interactions. This introduces a large
number of arbitrary couplings that will have to be ﬁxed in a speciﬁc model implementation.
We take this approach since it can be easily implemented in software tools.

We consider the particle content shown in Tab. 1. As mentioned above, even this choice
reﬂects some restrictions on the type of degrees of freedom present. However, this ﬁeld
content is suﬃcient for the discussion below. The interaction Lagrangian can be expressed
as follows

Lint = LSSV + LSSV V + LSV V + LSV ˜V + LΨΨV + LΨf V + LΨf S + Lf f S

+ LππV +ππV V + LπV ˜V + LΨf π + Lf f π ,

(1)

where Ψ ≡ {T, B, X} collectively denotes the VLQs. In addition to the ﬁeld content in
Tab. 1, V and f denote the SM gauge bosons and third generation quarks. The explicit
expressions for each term of the above Lagrangian are presented in the appendix.

For the time being, we use a FeynRules implementation of the above Lagrangian, limited
to the EW pNGBs, and VLQs [8], through which a UFO model [62] has been generated. The
UFO implementation allows the simulation of processes up to one-loop in QCD. A more
automatized tool, FSMOG (FeynRules plugin for Simpliﬁed MOdel Generation), is being
developed to facilitate the writing of the most general Lagrangian. The program will take
as input ﬁelds of given spin, charge, and color and output the FeynRules ﬁle containing
the most general interactions between these ﬁelds and the SM ones, up to a certain mass
dimension. At present this is limited to dimension-4 operators for simplicity, however future

decays into SM particles.

versions of FSMOG will include commonly used higher dimension operators. FSMOG is still
under development, but the current version can be obtained from the authors [9]. In this
implementation the reduction of number of independent couplings for a speciﬁc model is
achieved by using a FeynRules-style restriction card.

3 LHC bounds for pair production of pNGBs and VLQs

3.1 Electroweak pNGBs

In this section we conﬁne ourselves to the case where the only accessible degrees of freedom
are the pNGBs from the EW coset. We present the bounds on their production cross
sections times branching ratios as function of their mass in various channels. In this way,
the bounds are applicable to any BSM scenario with scalars.

The direct production of EW pNGBs can occur either via Drell-Yan processes or via

vector boson fusion. In case of pair production the Drell-Yan processes

clearly dominate. The vector boson fusion processes also allow single production via the
anomaly induced couplings, see Eq. (11) in the appendix. However, the corresponding cross
sections are rather small as these couplings are loop induced. Nevertheless, these couplings
become important for the pNGB decays if couplings to SM fermions are either forbidden or
strongly suppressed. In this case the dominant decays are

Combining these with the various production channels leads to a plethora of ﬁnal states
containing 4 gauge bosons, see for example left diagram in Fig. 1. A few of these processes
have been searched for directly: Ref. [63] sets bounds on the cross section times branching
ratio of S++S−− → W W W W and S±±S∓ → W W W Z, which are included in Fig. 2 .

Given a coset, the anomaly couplings of pNGBs to vector bosons are ﬁxed up to an
overall constant, while the couplings to fermions are more model-dependent. It is typically
possible to construct both fermiophobic as well as fermiophilic models.
If present, the
couplings of pNGBs to quarks in Eq. (17) of the appendix are expected to scale with mq/f ,

up to factors of order 1, where f is the pNGB decay constant. In this case the branching
ratios into third-generation quarks dominate over the loop-induced anomaly decays into
vector bosons. The corresponding decay channels are

S++ → W +tb,
S+ → tb,
S0 → tt, bb.

(5c)

Note that the three-body decay S++ → W +tb proceeds via an oﬀ-shell S+, see right diagram
in Fig. 1. To our knowledge, this channel has not been studied in the literature before. The
corresponding branching ratio is usually close to 100% as the decay S++ → W +W + is loop-
induced. In this section we assume that all pNGBs have the same mass. Eﬀects induced due
to mass diﬀerences are more model-dependent, hence we defer the corresponding discussion
to Sec. 4 for a speciﬁc model.

We determine the extent to which the currently recasted analyses can constrain processes
for which no direct searches exist. To this end, we have implemented simpliﬁed models in
FeynRules [71] at leading order. We have generated 105 events using MadGraph5 aMC@NLO
[72] version 3.3.1 with the NNPDF 2.3 set of parton densities [73, 74] and hadronized them
with Pythia8 [75]. To obtain constraints on the parameter space, the events are analysed
with MadAnalysis5, [76–79] version 1.9.60. MadAnalysis5 performs an event reconstruction
using Delphes 3 [80] and the anti-kT algorithm [81] implemented in FastJet [82], and
calculates an exclusion using the CLs prescription [83]. We also tested the generated events

against the SM measurements implemented in Rivet [84] version 3.1.5 and have calculated
exclusions from the respective YODA ﬁles with Contur [85, 86]. Here, we have used all
available analyses in Contur version 2.1.1, as well as Refs. [65, 66, 87] from the upcoming
release 2.2.1.

For ﬁnal states with quarks (in particular top quarks) we found BSM searches im-
plemented in MadAnalysis5 to be the most constraining.∗ In contrast, in case of vector
boson ﬁnal states, we obtain the bounds in general from measurements implemented in
Rivet, on which Contur is based. In Fig. 2 we present the bounds on the pair-production
cross section times branching ratio for various ﬁnal states. Beyond our recast results,
we also included the results of the ATLAS search for pp → S++S−− → W W W W and
pp → S±±S∓ → W W W Z [63] for completeness.
In Tab. 2 we give the most sensitive
Contur pools for the various vector boson ﬁnal states. In the case of quark ﬁnal states the
strongest bounds stem from the four-top search CMS-TOP-18-003 [90], which is implemented
in MadAnalysis5 [91].

For reference, in Fig. 2 we also show the production cross section for members of a

coset discussed in Sec. 4. Note that the references are production cross sections, while the
bounds shown are constraints on σ × Br. To obtain bounds on mS, these reference cross
sections must be multiplied by the (model-dependent) branching ratios into the respective
ﬁnal states. Comparing the theoretical cross sections to the obtained constraints, it is clear
that the currently implemented analyses can give bounds on mS of at most 400 GeV (in the
S∓S0-channel, if the respective branching ratios to W γ and γγ are close to 1). We want to
stress that other models give cross section of the same size. For example, the cross sections
shown for S++S−− and S±±S∓ are the same as for the SU (2)L triplet used in the ATLAS
analysis [63]. The main model dependence enters not in the pair production cross section
but in the branching ratios of the pNGB decays.

3.2 Vector-like quarks

Coloured particles have a privileged role in the determination of model-independent con-
straints from searches at the LHC, since the cross-section of QCD pair production depends
exclusively on their masses. VLQs have been extensively searched at the LHC by both
ATLAS and CMS, under the general assumption that the SM is minimally extended with
one VLQ, directly decaying into SM ﬁnal states. Strong bounds on their masses (above the
TeV) have been obtained regardless of their decay channels [92–103].

We have seen, however, that in the scenarios at hand VLQs can also interact with further
lighter exotic states, such as new pNGBs, changing their decay patterns as indicated in
Fig. 3. Exclusion bounds obtained under the aforementioned hypotheses thus require a
reinterpretation to account for the reduced branching ratios into SM ﬁnal states. Moreover,
the new decay channels can be tested against experimental data to obtain combined limits
on the masses of VLQs and the new states they can decay into. Experimental searches
targeting exotic decays of VLQs are not available yet, however phenomenological analyses
providing recasts of diﬀerent searches have already appeared [44, 104–113].

A summary of results from some of these analyses, corresponding to exclusive decays
(100% Br) of the VLQs into diﬀerent exotic states, is presented in Fig. 4. When additional
decay channels are open, bounds on VLQ masses can be signiﬁcantly lower than those

bounds (13 TeV, 36 fb−1) are shown by the solid lines while the projections for the high

ences). Current experimental bounds on the masses of VLQs decaying to SM particles only

accompanied by maps of experimental eﬃciencies or upper limits on the cross-sections in
the same plane for each relevant decay channel of the VLQ.† The representation proposed in
Fig. 4 has thus the purpose to provide an overview and a general reference for where realistic
bounds can be placed. We also present the projected exclusions in the same channels for
high luminosity LHC (3 ab−1) [44, 106].

To allow an easy comparison with experimental results, current bounds (and future
projections for some cases) on the masses of VLQs decaying to SM particles and bounds on
the masses of pair-produced pNGBs have also been included as horizontal [100,114–116] and
vertical [63,117,118] bars respectively. Notice that except for the colour sextet π6, a residual

model dependence aﬀects the exclusion limits: the pair production cross-section of an EW
pNGB depends on its coupling to the Z boson, which is associated with its representation
under the EW gauge group. Experimental bounds on charged scalars are obtained under
speciﬁc assumptions, for which we refer to the corresponding literature [63, 117, 118].

4 Case study: SU (5)/SO(5)

As a concrete example, we now consider a model based on the SU (5)/SO(5) coset after
having integrated out the VLQs. The UV theory can be constructed as in [17] and it’s being
studied on the lattice [119, 120]. This coset delivers a total of 14 pNGBs, which include
the Higgs bidoublet, a singlet η, and a bitriplet under SU (2)L × SU (2)R. Here we focus
on the bitriplet, as direct η production at the LHC is strongly suppressed. The bitriplet
decomposes as a quintuplet η5 ≡ (η0

custodial SU (2)C.

A detailed description of how all the couplings can be derived, including the VLQ sector,
has been given in [61]. For this section we consider the exotic pNGBs to be fermiophobic.
In Appendix A.1, we collect the relevant couplings, which depend on the pNGB decay
constant f , which we set to 1 TeV. The remaining parameters to be chosen are the masses
‡. Note that the exotic pNGBs do not acquire a vacuum
for the custodial multiplets m1,3,5
expectation value in this model.

In this scenario, these pNGBs are mainly produced through Drell-Yan processes (see
Eq. (2)). In the presence of a mass splitting between the custodial multiplets the decay
pattern changes with respect to the discussion in Sec. 3.
In such case the lowest lying
multiplet will still decay only via the anomaly. However, the heavier pNGBs will decay
dominantly into a possibly oﬀ-shell vector boson and a member of the lower lying multiplet,
as soon as the mass splitting is larger than about 1 GeV. As an example we take m3 ≥ m5,1,

Since Γη5,1 (cid:28) ΓW,Z, the decays into oﬀ-shell η5,1 and on-shell vector bosons are strongly
suppressed. Note that in scenarios where η3 is the lightest multiplet, η0
3 is forced to have
three body decays since it does not couple to the anomaly, see Fig. 5. We give examples
of branching ratios of η0
3 for diﬀerent scenarios in Fig. 6. We use the same set-up as in
Sec. 3 to determine bounds at the LHC, assuming a global K-factor of 1.15 to take QCD
corrections into account. We ﬁnd again that Contur yields stronger bounds than currently
available analyses in MadAnalysis5. The leading bounds are displayed in Fig. 7 for two
limiting scenarios: m1,3 (cid:28) m5 (left plot) and m3,5 (cid:28) m1 (right plot). The bounds on the
right side are much stronger due to the presence of the additional singly and doubly charged
states in the quintuplet.

In this appendix we provide the explicit expressions of each of the terms shown in Eq. (1)
which is also implemented in the software tools, albeit with a limited particle content. The
terms LSSV , LSSV V , and LππV +ππV V are simply the couplings of the pNGBs with the gauge
bosons, arising from the covariant derivative.

r − ieq(Aµ − tan θW Zµ) and sW (cW ) ≡ sin θW (cos θW ). Note that
the colored pNGBs do not carry any SU (2)L index in the models considered here and, thus,
the couplings to the Z arise purely from hypercharge. The LSV V consists of the coupling
of the Higgs boson to the EW gauge bosons.

Any additional pNGB acquiring a vacuum expectation value contributes to the masses of
the gauge bosons and acquires a coupling of this type. We consider here the case where only
the Higgs doublet receives a vacuum expectation value (v). In this case, the neutral scalars
easily evade all LEP collider bounds and no corrections to the tree-level ρ-parameter arise.
This choice is well motivated by a study of the potential for models given in [23, 40].

The Lagrangian LSV ˜V and LπV ˜V contain the dimension ﬁve anomalous couplings of the
pNGBs with the vector boson ﬁeld strengths. If one proceeds to integrate out the third
family or the heavy vector bosons, both LSV V and LSV ˜V include additional dimension ﬁve

A.1 Couplings in SU (5)/SO(5) coset

Now we present the explicit coupling strengths between the weak gauge bosons and EW
pNGBs in the custodial basis for SU (5)/SO(5) coset, in terms of sin θ ≡ sθ = v/f . The
couplings presented below can be directly used to construct the restriction cards for the
Feynrules-based tools we discussed earlier. In Tab. 3 we map the generic symbols for the
scalar ﬁelds used in the Eq. (1) to the speciﬁc symbols used for the SU (5)/SO(5) coset.
The coeﬃcient Kh
V V (V = W, Z), the universal modiﬁcation of the Higgs coupling with the
weak gauge bosons appearing in LSV V is given by cθ.
