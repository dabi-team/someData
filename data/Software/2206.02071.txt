ABSTRACT

In its long-duration observation phase, the PLATO satellite (scheduled for launch in 2026) will observe two independent, non-
overlapping ﬁelds, nominally one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere, for a total of four years. The
exact duration of each pointing will be determined two years before launch. Previous estimates of PLATO’s yield of Earth-sized
planets in the habitable zones (HZs) around solar-type stars ranged between 6 and 280. We use the PLATO Solar-like Light curve
Simulator (PSLS) to simulate light curves with transiting planets around bright (mV ≤ 11) Sun-like stars at a cadence of 25 s, roughly
representative of the > 15, 000 targets in PLATO’s high-priority P1 sample (mostly F5-K7 dwarfs and subdwarfs). Our study includes
light curves generated from synchronous observations of 6, 12, 18, and 24 of PLATO’s 12 cm aperture cameras over both 2 yr and 3 yr
of continuous observations. Automated detrending is done with the W¯otan software, and post-detrending transit detection is performed
with the transit least-squares (TLS) algorithm. Light curves combined from 24 cameras yield true positive rates (TPRs) near unity for
planets ≥1.2 R⊕ with two transits. If a third transit is in the light curve, planets as small as 1 R⊕ are recovered with TPR ∼ 100 %. We
scale the TPRs with the expected number of stars in the P1 sample and with modern estimates of the exoplanet occurrence rates and
predict the detection of planets with 0.5 R⊕ ≤ Rp ≤ 1.5 R⊕ in the HZs around F5-K7 dwarf stars. For the long-duration observation
phase (2 yr + 2 yr) strategy we predict 11–34 detections, and for the (3 yr + 1 yr) strategy we predict 8–25 discoveries. These estimates
neglect exoplanets with monotransits, serendipitous detections in stellar samples P2–P5, a dedicated removal of systematic eﬀects,
and a possible bias of the P1 sample toward brighter stars and high camera coverage due to noise requirements. As an opposite eﬀect,
Earth-sized planets might typically exhibit transits around P1 sample stars shallower than we have assumed since the P1 sample will
be skewed toward spectral types earlier than the Sun-like stars assumed in our simulations. Moreover, our study of the eﬀects of stellar
variability on shallow transits of Earth-like planets illustrates that our estimates of PLATO’s planet yield, which we derive using a
photometrically quiet star similar to the Sun, must be seen as upper limits. In conclusion, PLATO’s detection of about a dozen Earth-
sized planets in the HZs around solar-type stars will mean a major contribution to this as yet poorly sampled part of the exoplanet
parameter space with Earth-like planets.

1. Introduction

The science of extrasolar planets is driven to a large extent by
transiting planets, that is, planets passing in front of their host
stars once every orbit as seen from Earth (Charbonneau et al.
2000). In fact, most of the planets known beyond the Solar Sys-
tem have been found via the transit method in the long-term
stellar light curves from space-based missions, starting with 37
planets and brown dwarfs from the CoRoT mission (2009-2013;
Auvergne et al. 2009; Deleuil et al. 2018), over 2700 exoplan-
ets and about 2100 candidates yet to be validated1 from the Ke-
pler primary mission (2009-2013; Borucki et al. 2010), more
than 500 transiting planets and almost 1000 candidates1 from the
extended Kepler mission, called K2 (2014-2018; Howell et al.
2014), and the addition of over 200 exoplanets1 discovered with
the ongoing TESS mission (since 2018; Ricker et al. 2015).

Despite the rapid increase in the number of known plan-
ets by about three orders of magnitude within three decades

as of 20 June 2022

(Heller & Kiss 2019), it remains extremely challenging to ﬁnd
Earth-sized planets in Earth-like orbits around Sun-like stars.
As a result, it is hard to constrain their occurrence rates, even
with four years of continuous observations from the Kepler pri-
mary mission (Mulders et al. 2019; Hsu et al. 2019; Kunimoto
& Matthews 2020; Bryson et al. 2021). The key challenges for
Kepler were the small number of transits of these planets (Ke-
pler required three), a systematic eﬀect in the Kepler data known
as the rolling-band eﬀect (Van Cleve & Caldwell 2016; Thomp-
son et al. 2018; Bryson et al. 2021), and the fact that stars are
more variable than predicted via the scaling of the solar power
spectrum (Gilliland et al. 2011, 2015). Even detections of super-
Earth-sized planets in one-year orbits around Sun-like stars such
as Kepler-452 b (Jenkins et al. 2015) and KOI-456.04 (Heller
et al. 2020) have been challenging due to these caveats (Mullally
et al. 2018).

The science objective of the PLATO mission (Rauer et al.
2014), with an expected launch in December 2026, is to ﬁnd ter-
restrial planets in the habitable zones (HZs; Kasting et al. 1993)

coordinates (an updated version is available in Nascimbeni et al. 2022). The centers of the NPF and SPF are covered by 24 cameras (light blue).
Increasingly darker blue tones refer to a coverage by 18, 12, and 6 cameras, respectively. Provisional step-and-stare ﬁeld pointings (STEP01 –
STEP10) use dark blue tones for an overlap of 24 cameras and lighter blue tones for 18, 12, and 6 cameras, respectively. The ﬁelds of CoRoT

of solar-like stars and to determine their bulk properties2. To
achieve this goal, PLATO’s 24 normal cameras3 will observe
over 15, 000 bright (mV ≤ 11) dwarfs and subgiants of spec-
tral types F5-K7 with a precision of 50 ppm in 1 hr of integra-
tion (Montalto et al. 2021). This subset of the hundreds of thou-
sands of stars that PLATO will observe in total is referred to
as the P1 stellar sample, and it will be given the highest prior-
ity of all the samples. Over 5000 stars with mV ≤ 11 will have
their bulk densities measured using asteroseismology. The P1
sample will be observed during the long-duration observation
phase, which will take a total of four years, and be compiled
from the northern PLATO ﬁeld (NPF) and the southern PLATO
ﬁeld (SPF). Figure 1 shows the distribution of the PLATO ﬁelds
that include the preliminary NPF and SPF on the celestial plane.
A more up-to-date deﬁnition of these ﬁelds, which are referred
to as Long-duration Observation Phase North 1 (LOPN1) and
Long-duration Observation Phase South 1 (LOPS1), is given in
(Nascimbeni et al. 2022).

The Gaia mission has already provided highly accurate par-
allax and optical photometry measurements of essentially all
main-sequence stars with mV (cid:46) 20 (Gaia Collaboration et al.
2016, 2021). In combination with eﬀective temperature mea-
surements from PLATO’s ground-based high-resolution spec-
troscopy follow-up, stellar radii will be determined with an accu-
racy of 1–2 %, masses will be inferred with an accuracy of 10 %,

3 The 24 “normal” cameras will observe stars with apparent visual
magnitudes mV (cid:38) 8 in white light with a cadence of 25 s. Two addi-
tional “fast” cameras will observe very bright stars with 4 (cid:46) mV (cid:46) 8 in
two diﬀerent color ﬁlters (one in a blue ﬁlter, the other in a red ﬁlter)
with a cadence of 2.5 s. The fast cameras will be used for color reﬁne-
ments of astrophysical processes and ﬁne guidance.

and ages will be estimated using stellar evolution models with
an accuracy of 10 % for over 5 000 F5-K7 stars.

The PLATO Deﬁnition Study Report predicted PLATO’s
yield of Earth-sized transiting planets in the HZ around Sun-
like stars to range between 6 and 280. The details depend on
PLATO’s observing strategy, that is, whether it observes its two
independent long-duration observation phase ﬁelds for 2 yr each
(the 2 yr + 2 yr scenario) or one ﬁeld for 3 yr and the other one
for 1 yr (the 3 yr + 1 yr scenario). These yield predictions were
derived with exoplanet occurrence rates that were still very un-
certain at the time (Fressin et al. 2013). The PLATO Deﬁnition
Study Report considered an occurrence rate of planets in the HZ
with radii smaller than two Earth radii (Rp < 2 R⊕) of between
2 % and 100 %, with a nominal value of 40 %. The most recent
and comprehensive statistical analysis of the completeness and
reliability of the Kepler survey by Bryson et al. (2021) suggests
that the occurrence rate of planets with 0.5 R⊕ ≤ Rp ≤ 1.5 R⊕
and orbital periods between 340 d and 760 d (the conservative
HZ; Kopparapu et al. 2014) around G and K dwarf stars is closer
to 60 %. Moreover, previous yield predictions for PLATO were
necessarily based on analytical estimates of the expected signal-
to-noise ratio (S/N) of the transits and taking the activity of Sun-
like stars observed with Kepler into account.

With the launch date of the PLATO mission approaching,
great progress has been made in the simulation of light curves
that can be expected from PLATO. The PLATOSim software
(Marcos-Arenal et al. 2014) provides end-to-end simulations
from the charge-coupled device (CCD) level to the ﬁnal light
curve product. The PLATO Solar-like Light curve Simulator
(PSLS), following a much more pragmatic and computation-
ally eﬃcient approach, allows simulations of a large number
of PLATO-like light curves with realistic treatment of the main
sources of astrophysical and systematic noise (Samadi et al.
2019). As for transit detection, the W¯otan detrending software

René Heller et al.: Transit least-squares survey – IV. Earth-like planets from PLATO

for stellar light curves has been optimized with a particular fo-
cus on the preservation of exoplanet transits (Hippke et al. 2019).
This optimization was achieved based on extended benchmark-
ing tests invoking detrending and transit searches in light curves
from the Kepler primary mission, K2, and TESS. Finally, the
release of the transit least-squares (TLS) software provides en-
hanced detection sensitivity for small planets over the tradi-
tional box least-squares (BLS) algorithm (Kovács et al. 2002).
As shown by Hippke & Heller (2019), for a parameterization of
TLS and BLS that produces a false positive rate (FPR) of 1 % in a
search for transits of Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars, the
true positive rate (TPR) of TLS is about 93 %, while it is roughly
76 % for BLS. This sensitivity gain of TLS over BLS will be vital
for PLATO’s discovery of Earth-sized planets in the HZs around
Sun-like stars.

The key objectives of this paper are to update PLATO’s ex-
pected yield of Earth-like planets in the HZs around Sun-like
stars and to test if currently available transit search software
would be suﬃcient to ﬁnd these planets in PLATO data and en-
able PLATO to achieve its science objectives.

2. Methods

The principal approach of our study is as follows. We used PSLS
to simulate a suﬃciently large number (∼10, 000) of PLATO-
like light curves for Sun-like stars, including stellar variability
and systematic eﬀects, some with transits of Earth-like planets,
some without any transits. Then we used W¯otan to automatically
detrend the light curves from any stellar and systematic variabil-
ity while preserving any possible transit signals. To infer the de-
tectability of the injected transits as well as the corresponding
false alarm probability, we searched for the transits using TLS.
A comparison of the injected signals with our results from the
recovery tests then yielded the true and FPRs, which we scaled
with literature values for the planet occurrence rates to predict
the number of Earth-like planets to be detected with PLATO.

2.1. PLATO Solar-like Light Curve Simulator

Our analysis starts with the generation of synthetic PLATO-like
light curves with the publicly available4 PSLS (v1.3) Python soft-
ware (Samadi et al. 2019). PSLS simulates Poisson noise charac-
teristic for a given stellar magnitude, instrumental eﬀects, sys-
tematic errors, and stellar variability.

In a ﬁrst step, PSLS reads the input YAML ﬁle to simulate
the stellar signal in Fourier space. Then random noise is added
(Anderson et al. 1990) to mimic the stochastic behavior of the
signal and ﬁnally the signal is transformed back into the time
domain to generate the light curve.

The stellar oscillation spectrum is computed as a sum of
resolved and unresolved diﬀerential modes, which are mod-
eled with speciﬁc Lorentzian proﬁles in the power spectral den-
sity space (Berthomieu et al. 2001; Samadi et al. 2019). The
mode frequencies, mode heights, and mode line widths for main-
sequence and subgiant stars are precomputed with the Aarhus
adiabatic pulsation package (ADIPLS) (Christensen-Dalsgaard
2008). Stellar activity phenomena such as magnetic activity
(star spots), p-mode oscillations, and granulation lead to time-
dependent variability for the disk-integrated ﬂux of a solar-like
star. The stellar activity component is simulated in PSLS with a
Lorentzian proﬁle in frequency space, and it includes an ampli-
tude (σA, subscript “A” referring to activity) and a characteristic

timescale (τA), both of which can be adjusted in PSLS (Samadi
et al. 2019). Stellar granulation, caused by convection currents of
plasma within the star’s convective zone, occurs on a scale from
granules the size of ∼0.5 Mm (∼0.08 R⊕) to supergranules with
diameters of ∼16 Mm (∼2.5 R⊕), all of which appear stochasti-
cally over time (Morris et al. 2020). Granulation is simulated in
PSLS using the two pseudo-Lorentzian functions with character-
istic timescales τ1,2 (Samadi et al. 2019).

Systematic errors of the PLATO instrument are simulated
in PSLS using the Plato Image Simulator (PIS), developed at
the Laboratoire d’études spatiales et d’instrumentation en as-
trophysique (LESIA) at the Observatoire de Paris. PIS mod-
els diﬀerent sources of noise and other perturbations, like pho-
ton noise, readout noise, smearing, long-term drift, satellite
jitter, background signal, intra-pixel response nonuniformity,
pixel response nonuniformity, digital saturation (Janesick 2001;
Marcos-Arenal et al. 2014), charge diﬀusion (Lauer 1999), and
charge transfer ineﬃciency (Short et al. 2013). In our simula-
tions we used the beginning-of-life setup tables for systemat-
ics, where charge transfer ineﬃciency is not included in sim-
ulating systematics. We also turned oﬀ jitter in PIS as it de-
mands substantial amounts of CPU time. Furthermore, accord-
ing to the PLATO Study Deﬁnition Report, the pointing errors
are expected to be suﬃciently low that they will be negligible to
the overall noise (see also Marchiori et al. 2019). Light curves
for the P1 sample will not be extracted from aperture masks but
from the downloaded imagettes using the point-spread function
ﬁtting method. The resulting systematic eﬀects, including jumps
in the light curves at the quarterly repositioning of the stars on
the PLATO CCDs after satellite rotation, are properly taken into
account in PSLS.

Finally, planetary transits can be automatically simulated in
PSLS data using the Mandel & Agol (2002) model. The actual
implementation in PSLS is based on the Python code of Ian
Crossﬁeld5. PSLS users can specify the transit parameters, in-
cluding the planet radius (Rp), the orbital period (P), the planet
semimajor axis (a), and the orbital inclination. Transits assume a
quadratic limb darkening law as per Mandel & Agol (2002), and
the two quadratic limb darkening coeﬃcients of the star can be
manually adjusted.

For all our simulations, we chose a solar-type star with so-
lar radius and mass and with Sun-like stellar activity to repre-
sent the expected 15,000 to 20,000 F5 - K7 stars in the P1 sam-
ple. As for the amplitude and characteristic timescale of stel-
lar photometric activity, we assumed activity parameters close
to those of 16 Cyg B, that is, σA = 20 ppm and τA = 0.27 d.
This is similar to the values used in the default parameteriza-
tion of the PSLS YAML input ﬁle, as described in Samadi et al.
(2019, Appendix A therein). 16 Cyg B is a solar-type oscillating
main-sequence star, for which stellar activity, asteroseismology,
and rotation periods have been well constrained using Kepler
data (Davies et al. 2015). In Appendix C we examine the eﬀects
of diﬀerent levels of stellar variability on transit detection with
PLATO.

The resulting PSLS light curves are derived as averages from
6, 12, 18, or 24 light curves (corresponding to the number of
cameras) and have a cadence of 25 s, representative of the data
that will be extracted for the P1 sample. For reference, a PSLS
light curve worth of 2 yr (3 yr) of simulated observations con-
tains about 2.5 (3.7) million data points.

2.2. Light curve detrending with W¯otan

W¯otan is a publicly available6 Python software for the detrend-
ing of stellar light curves under optimized preservation of ex-
oplanet transit signatures (Hippke et al. 2019). The key value
of W¯otan is in its removal of instrumental and stellar variability
from light curves to prepare them for transit searches. W¯otan
features many diﬀerent detrending methods. Among all these
detrending ﬁlters, Hippke et al. (2019) identiﬁed the biweight
method as the optimal choice in most cases.

We thus use the biweight method in this work with a window
size of three times the expected maximum transit duration, as
suggested by Hippke et al. (2019), to preserve the transit signa-
tures while removing any other type of variability from the sim-
ulated light curves from PSLS. It is worth noting that while we
restrict our search to transits of planets in Earth-like orbits and,
hence, Earth-like transit durations, in an unrestricted search for
transits of diﬀerent durations the window size of the detrending
algorithm would need to be adapted accordingly. W¯otan’s treat-
ment of jumps in the PSLS light curves is described in Sect. 4.3.

2.3. Transit Least-Squares

The transit search is executed with the publicly available7 TLS
algorithm (Hippke & Heller 2019). TLS is optimized for ﬁnd-
ing small planets. The principal sensitivity gain over the BLS
algorithm (Kovács et al. 2002) is in TLS’s accurate modeling
of the planetary ingress and egress and stellar limb-darkening.
The template of TLS’s transit search function is parameterized
by two limb darkening coeﬃcients required to feed the analyti-
cal solution for the light curve with a quadratic limb darkening
law (Mandel & Agol 2002).

TLS ﬁnds the minimum χ2 value for a range of trial orbital
periods (P), transit times t0, and transit durations d. The orbital
eccentricity is assumed to be zero, but the transit sequence of
planets in highly eccentric orbits are typically found with TLS
as long as the transits are periodic. TLS does not ﬁt for transit
timing variations (TTVs), but transits are usually recovered as
long as the TTV amplitude is smaller than the transit duration.

The key search metric for TLS is the signal detection eﬃ-
ciency (SDE), which is a measure for the signiﬁcance of the χ2
minimum compared to the surrounding χ2 landscape as a func-
tion of the period. Hippke & Heller (2019), using simulated tran-
sits of Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars in synthetic light
curves with a white noise component of 110 ppm per 30 min in-
tegration (corresponding to a photometrically quiet mV = 12
star observed with Kepler), found that a detection threshold of
SDE ≥ 9 results in an FPR < 10−4 for TLS. At the same
time, various studies have demonstrated that this threshold is
suﬃciently low for TLS to detect Earth-sized planets around low-
mass stars in Kepler (Heller et al. 2019b,a) and TESS (Trifonov
et al. 2021; Rao et al. 2021; Feliz et al. 2021) data, super-Earths
around solar-type stars (Heller et al. 2020), and possibly even
Mars-sized planets in close orbits around subdwarfs from Ke-
pler (Van Grootel et al. 2021). Hence, we use SDE = 9 in this
work as well. Moreover, we require S/N > 7 for any candidate
signal to count as a detection. This threshold has been shown
to yield one statistical false alarm in a sample of 100,000 pho-
tometrically quiet stars from the Kepler mission with normally
distributed noise (Jenkins et al. 2002, Sect. 2.3 therein). TLS cal-
culates the S/N as (δ/σo) n1/2, where δ is the mean depth of the

trial transit, σo is the standard deviation of the out-of-transit data,
and n is the number of in-transit data points (Pont et al. 2006).
We do not use any binning of the light curves in TLS because
our focus is completeness rather than computational speed. We
mask out any residual jumps in the light curve after detrending
using the transit_mask parameter in TLS.

In Fig. 2 we summarize the sequence of steps executed
with PSLS, W¯otan, and TLS. In panel (a), trends are dominantly
caused by spacecraft drift, inducing changes of the camera point-
ings and a motion of the target star across CCD pixels with dif-
ferent quantum sensitivities. Jumps result from satellite rotation
and the resulting repositioning of the star on the PLATO CCDs
at the beginning of each PLATO quarter. Panel (b) shows the de-
trended light curve, which we obtain by dividing the simulated
light curve from PSLS (black points in (a)) by the trend computed
with W¯otan (red line in (a)). Panel (c) presents the phase-folded
light curve of the transit detected with TLS, including the phase-
folded PSLS data (black dots), the TLS best ﬁtting transit model
(red line), and the 21-bin walking median of the data (blue line).
In this example, TLS produces SDE = 7.3 and S/N = 24.5. We
point out that the purpose of TLS is not exoplanet characteriza-
tion but exoplanet detection. A Markov chain Monte Carlo ﬁtting
procedure that takes into account the stellar mass and radius as
well as the best-ﬁt values for t0, P, and d from TLS as priors (as in
Heller et al. 2020) can improve the system parameter estimates
substantially.

2.4. Exoplanet occurrence rates and transit probability

Petigura et al. (2013) showed that the occurrence rate of ex-
oplanets with 2 R⊕ < Rp < 4 R⊕ and 200 d < P < 400 d
around Sun-like stars is 5 (± 2.1) %. The occurrence rate of
smaller planets in this period range was unconstrained. A thor-
ough treatment of Kepler’s false positive transit events by Bryson
et al. (2021) resulted in an occurrence rate of planets with radii
0.5 R⊕ < Rp < 1.5 R⊕ and inside the conservative HZs around
GK stars close to ∼ 60 %, details depending on the parameter-
ization of the HZ as a function of the stellar properties and on
the reliability of exoplanet detections against systematic false
positives (Bryson et al. 2020). For our purpose of estimating
PLATO’s Earth-like planet yield, we assume a 37 % occurrence
rate in the conservative scenario and 88 % in the optimistic sce-
nario, referring to stellar population Model 1 and hab2 stars in
Table 3 of Bryson et al. (2021).

PLATO’s P1 sample contains at least 15,000 and up to
20,000 dwarf and subgiant bright (mV ≤ 11) stars with spectral
types F5-K7. Detailed histograms for the mass, radius, eﬀective
temperature, distance, and Gaia magnitude distributions of the
PLATO stellar sample have recently been published by Montalto
et al. (2021), but were not available before the end of our sim-
ulations. We consider 15,000 stars for our conservative scenario
and 20,000 stars for our optimistic scenario. We assume that the
P1 stars will be equally distributed over the NPF and SPF dur-
ing the long-duration observation phase (Fig. 1), that is, we as-
sume 7500 (or 10,000) stars in each of the two ﬁelds. Hence,
the (2 yr + 2 yr) strategy will contribute 15,000 stars in the con-
servative and 20,000 stars in the optimistic scenario. In contrast,
the (3 yr + 1 yr) strategy will only contribute 7500 (or 10,000)
stars to our experiment since we assume that the 1 yr ﬁeld will
not yield any periodic transits (only mono transits) of Earth-like
planets in the HZs around Sun-like stars.

As for our neglect of ﬁnding mono transits in PLATO’s hy-
pothetical 1 yr long-duration observation ﬁeld, TLS (like BLS and
similar phase-folding algorithms) is most sensitive to periodic

René Heller et al.: Transit least-squares survey – IV. Earth-like planets from PLATO

760 d (within the conservative HZ) around F5-K7 dwarf stars in
the conservative scenario. In the optimistic scenario, we expect
observations of 20, 000 × 88 % × 0.5 % ∼ 88 such planets.
The question we want to answer with our transit injection and
retrieval experiment in simulated PLATO data is how many of
these transits a state-of-the-art transit detection software would
be able to detect.

2.5. PLATO ﬁeld of view and star count

For the purpose of computing PLATO’s expected planet yield,
we weight the planet detection rates for diﬀerent camera counts
(6, 12, 18, 24) with the relative areas of the camera count
coverage on the celestial plane. The combined ﬁeld of view
of PLATO’s 24 normal cameras is 2132 deg2. The provisional
pointings of the long-duration observation ﬁelds (NPF and SPF)8
as well as the provisional pointings during the step-and-stare
phase are shown in Fig. 1. Both the NPF and SPF are centered
around a Galactic latitude of 30◦. Though not perfectly iden-
tical, the stellar densities in the NPF and SPF are extremely
similar (Fig. 8 in Nascimbeni et al. 2022). The central area of
the PLATO ﬁeld, which is covered by all 24 normal cameras, is
294 deg2 (13.8% of the combined ﬁeld of view). The area cov-
ered by 18 cameras has a size of 171 deg2 (8.0%), by 12 cameras
796 deg2 (37.3%), and by 6 cameras 871 deg2 (40.9%) (Pertenais
et al. 2021).

We also weight the planet detection rates with the relative
star count as a function of apparent magnitude in these areas.
We examine the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3; Gaia Col-
laboration et al. 2016, 2021) and ﬁnd a total of 1,247,240 stars
with a G-band magnitude mG ≤ 11 in the NPF and SPF. We
then broke the Gaia EDR3 star counts into the following mag-
nitude bins, assuming similar relative star counts in the PLATO
wavelength band:

mG < 8.5
8.5 ≤ mG < 9.5

mV = 8 :
⇒ 106, 364 stars (8.5 %)
mV = 9 :
⇒ 187, 884 stars (15.1 %)
mV = 10 : 9.5 ≤ mG < 10.5 ⇒ 484, 765 stars (38.9 %)
mV = 11 : 10.5 ≤ mG ≤ 11
⇒ 468, 228 stars (37.5 %).

The purpose of this binning was to obtain the weighting factors
for the TPRs from our injection-retrieval tests that include stars
of diﬀerent magnitude. As for the spectral types, the distribu-
tion of stellar spectral types in the NPF and SPF was unknown
at the time of our writing, and the all-sky PLATO input catalog
has only been published very recently (Montalto et al. 2021). It
would not have been helpful to take spectral type counts from
Gaia because additional conditions are applied to the selection
of the P1 sample stars in addition to magnitude cuts. Hence, we
chose a Sun-like star for reference. This choice follows the pro-
cedure of using Sun-like benchmark targets in the PLATO Def-
inition Study Report (p. 111 therein). This approximation cer-
tainly aﬀects the expected planet yields signiﬁcantly, the extent
of which could be examined in future studies.

2.6. Transit injection-and-retrieval experiment

We create two sets of light curves with PSLS. In the pollinated
set, each light curve contains a transit sequence of one planet. In

the Kepler primary mission. Though not a primary focus of PLATO, this
overlap might allow for the validation of a signiﬁcant number of Kepler
exoplanet candidates and could help to secure exoplanet ephemeris.

signals. Although large-scale human inspection of thousands of
light curves from the Kepler (Wang et al. 2013, 2015) and K2
missions (LaCourse & Jacobs 2018) have revealed about 200
mono transit candidates in total, the corresponding planets are all
substantially larger than Earth. There have also been serendipi-
tous mono transit discoveries with dedicated follow-up observa-
tions to conﬁrm rare long-period transiting candidates as planets
(Giles et al. 2018) and progress has been made on the method-
ological side with the development of new automatized search
tools for mono transits (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2016; Osborn
et al. 2016). But in none of these cases mono transits from Earth-
sized planets have been shown to be detectable.

The geometric transit probability of an exoplanet can be
approximated as Pgeo ∼ Rs/a. In our case of planets at 1 AU
around solar-type stars we have R(cid:12)/1 AU ∼ 0.5 %. We thus ex-
pect PLATO to observe (but not necessarily deliver detectable

search in each 2 yr (3 yr) light curve with TLS includes periods
between 50.0 d and 364.75 d (547.25 d), the upper boundary cho-
sen to embrace the most long-period planets that exhibit at least
two transits, and typically takes 4.5 h (10 h). These numbers were
measured during parallel processing of typically around ten jobs,
giving a total CPU time of about 270 d.

3. Results

For Earth-sized planets only, we also simulated 2 yr and 3 yr
light curves for all combinations of stellar apparent magnitudes
mV ∈ {8, 9, 10, 11} and camera counts ncams ∈ {6, 12, 18, 24}, giv-
ing another 2 × 4 × 4 × 100 = 3200 light curves. For the control
set, which does not contain any transits, we compute 2 yr and
3 yr light curves for mV ∈ {8, 9, 10, 11} and ncams ∈ {6, 12, 18, 24},
leading again to 2 × 4 × 4 × 100 = 3200 light curves. All things
combined, we generated 10, 400 light curves with PSLS.

For all simulated transits, we set the transit impact parame-
ter to zero, which means that we assumed that all transits occur
across the entire diameter. We also used t0 = 91 d and P = 364 d
throughout our simulations; the latter choice was made to pre-
vent a systematic eﬀect at the Earth’s orbital period of 365.25 d
that was apparent in some PSLS light curves.

We execute our computations on a (4×12)-core AMD
Opteron(tm) 6174 processor (2200 MHz) on a GNU/Linux op-
erating system with a 64-bit architecture. Computation of a 2 yr
(3 yr) light curve with PSLS takes about 5 min (9 min), depend-
ing on the conﬁguration. The detrending of a 2 yr (3 yr) light

3.1. Detection rates
In Fig. 3 we show the SDE versus S/N distribution obtained with
TLS for 100 light curves that cover 2 yr from 24 PLATO cam-
eras. Each light curve featured one transiting planet in a 364 d
orbit around an mV = 8 Sun-like star. Panel (a) refers to plan-
ets with a radius of 0.8 R⊕, panel (b) refers to Rp = 0.9 R⊕. Al-
though TLS has the ability to search for successively weaker sig-
nals in a given light curve, we stop our search after the ﬁrst de-
tection of the strongest signal. Quadrant I, where SDE ≥ 9 and
S/N ≥ 7, contains the true positives (black ﬁlled dots), that is, the
retrievals of the injected transits. We deﬁne two types of false
positives. Red open circles in quadrant I represent false posi-
tives not related to quarter jumps and red crossed circles illus-
trate false positives caused by quarter jumps. Moreover, we de-
ﬁne three types of false negatives. One such type is a detection
of the injected signal with SDE < 9 or S/N < 7 or both (gray
ﬁlled dots). False negatives can also be unrelated to the injected
signal and instead be caused by TLS’s detection of systematic or
astrophysical variability below our nominal SDE-S/N detection

each histogram bar. Detections are deﬁned as any recovery of an injected signal within ±1 d of the injected P or T0 values and if the injected

of a quarter jump, we plot it with a black open circle. If a false
negative is caused by a quarter jump outside of quadrant I, we
illustrate it with a black crossed circle. The histograms along the
ordinate and abscissa illustrate the SDE and S/N distributions of
the injected signal recoveries (black ﬁlled bars) and false detec-
tions (red line bars), respectively.

In comparing Figs. 3(a) and (b), we recognize a substantial
shift of the SDE versus S/N distribution toward higher values,
respectively. As a consequence, the TPR increases from 3 % in

panel (a) to 39 % in panel (b). The FPR (red symbols in quadrant
I) is 4 % in (a) and 6 % in (b). As a result, the detection reliability,
which we deﬁne as R = TPR/(TPR + FPR), is 3/7 ∼ 43 % in
panel (a) and R = 39/45 ∼ 87 % in panel (b).

planet in a one-year orbit. As true positives, we count TLS detections that fulﬁll the same criteria as those in Fig. 5. (a) Simulated light curves from

cameras over 2 yr (similar to Fig. 3), whereas panel (b) shows
our results for 3 yr light curves. In our analysis of the 2 yr
light curves, each of which contains two transits, we obtain
TPR = 78 %, FNR = 17 %, FPR = 5 %, and R = 94 %. For
comparison, in Fig. 4(b), where each light curve contained three
transits, we ﬁnd TPR = 100 % and R = 100 %.

As a major result of this study, we ﬁnd that all of the injected
transits of Earth-sized planets in Earth-like orbits around mV = 8
Sun-like stars are recovered when three transits are available.
In fact, the increase in both SDE and S/N is signiﬁcantly more
pronounced when moving from two to three transits compared
to increasing the planetary radius from 0.8 R⊕ to 1 R⊕. Moreover,
our measurements of the detection reliability suggests that R ∼
100 % for Earth-sized planets and larger.

In Fig. 5 and the following plots in this paper, we ne-
glect any false positives detected with periods near the PLATO
quarters, that is, with P = 90 (±1) d and full-integer mul-
tiples of that. W¯otan does a decent job at removing quar-
terly jumps (see Fig. 2), but real PLATO data will be cleaned
from gaps and jumps prior to any transit search, which is
why this sort of false positives will be drastically reduced in
the analysis of real PLATO data. The histograms in Fig. 5 il-
lustrate the TPRs as a function of the injected planet radius
(Rp ∈ {0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4} × R⊕). For each planetary ra-
dius, we show four bars, which refer to mV ∈ {11, 10, 9, 8} from
left to right, respectively. All light curves were simulated with
24 PLATO cameras. Panel (a) refers to 2 yr light curves with two
transits, and panel (b) refers to 3 yr light curves with three tran-
sits.

As a general trend, and as expected, we ﬁnd that the TPRs in-
crease with increasing planetary radius in both panel (a) and (b).
In panel (a), the TPRs of the 2 yr light curves are on the percent
level for the smallest planets that we investigated (Rp = 0.8 R⊕),
irrespective of the stellar apparent magnitude. For Rp = 0.9 R⊕,

like stars with mV ∈ {9, 10, 11}, all of which assumed 24 cameras, are
available in Appendix A.

Article number, page 8 of 19

the TPRs in (a) increase from 9 % for mV = 11 to 20 % for
mV = 10 and 50 % for mV = 9. Interestingly, the brightest stars
(mV = 8) do not yield the largest TPRs (39 %), which we at-
tribute to the associated saturation of the CCD pixels. This loss
of true positives due to saturation is only present for sub-Earth-
sized planets in panel (a). For Earth-sized planets, the TPR is
about 28 % for mV = 11 and near 80 % for mV ∈ {10, 9, 8}. For
planets as large as or larger than 1.2 R⊕ the TPRs are near 100 %.
For comparison, in panel (b) the TPRs of the 3 yr light curves
are between about 20 % and 45 % for Rp = 0.8 R⊕, which rep-
resents a substantial boost from the near zero TPRs derived for
these small planets in the 2 yr light curves in panel (a). Moreover,
the TPRs in panel (b) reach 80 % for Rp = 0.9 R⊕ and between
91 % and 100 % for Rp = R⊕, details depending on the apparent
stellar magnitude. For planets as large or larger than 1.2 R⊕ the
TPRs are 100 % for all apparent stellar magnitudes.

In Fig. 6 we focus on Earth-sized planets in one-year orbits
around bright (mV = 8) Sun-like stars, showing the TPRs, the
FPRs, and the FNRs. Panel (a) refers to 2 yr light curves with
two transits, and panel (b) refers to 3 yr light curves with three
transits. In each panel, four histograms illustrate the respective
rates for 6, 12, 18, and 24 PLATO cameras (see histogram titles).
In general, the highest TPRs and lowest FNRs in Fig. 6 are
obtained for the largest camera counts and lowest apparent stel-
lar magnitudes. As a general result we ﬁnd that TPRs are almost
always < 75 % based on two transits in the 2 yr light curves in
panel (a), even for 24 cameras and mV ∈ {8, 9, 10}. For com-
parison, for three transits in the 3 yr light curves in panel (b),
TPR ≈ 100 % in almost all the cases that we investigated, except
for PSLS light curves simulated with 6 cameras of moderately
dim stars with mV ∈ {10, 11} and for light curves from 12 cam-
eras and mV = 11. For systems with three transits, TPRs are near
100 % for mV ∈ {8, 9} and about 75 % for mV = 10 even for as
few as six PLATO cameras. As a consequence, an increase in the
camera count is only beneﬁcial to the TPRs of Earth-sized plan-
ets with three transits around stars with mV = 11 (and likely for
even dimmer stars).

Simulated light curves from PSLS with a duration of 2 yr. (b) Simulated light curves from PSLS with a duration of 3 yr.

Figure 6 also demonstrates that the TPRs increase substan-
tially for targets with low camera counts (ncams ∈ {6, 12}) when
adding a third transit. This is particularly important given the
fact that most of the PLATO ﬁeld of view is covered with 6 cam-
eras (40.9%) or 12 cameras (37.3%) (see Fig. 1 and Sect. 2.5).
As a consequence, these areas have the greatest impact on the
expected planet yields. Adding observations of a third transit is
extremely beneﬁcial to the planet yields in these regions of the
PLATO ﬁeld of view that are covered by 6 or 12 cameras.

Figure 7 illustrates the TNRs and FPRs obtained with TLS
from PSLS light curves without any injected signal. Panel (a)
refers to 2 yr light curves, panel (b) refers to 3 yr light curves.
As a general result, FPRs for the 2 yr light curves in (a) are on
the percent level at most and we do not observe any signiﬁcant
correlation between the FPRs and the camera count or the FPRs
and the stellar apparent magnitude. For the 3 yr light curves in
(b), our interpretation is similar except for a dramatic increase in
the FPRs to 100 % for ncams = 6 and mV = 8. In this particular
conﬁguration, saturation is combined with a particularly weak
transit signal and so TLS is more sensitive to the quarter jumps
than to the transit.

3.2. Earth-like planet yield

Next, we predict PLATO’s yield of Earth-like planets in the HZ
around Sun-like stars. To this purpose, we ﬁrst interpolate the
TPRs derived from light curves with 24 PLATO cameras to cover
the entire range of planetary radii we are interested in. For the
2 yr light curves, we use TPR = 0 for Rp ≤ 0.7 R⊕ and for the
3 yr light curves, we use TPR = 0 for Rp ≤ 0.6 R⊕ for all magni-
tudes, respectively (illustrated in Fig. 5). We then use our results
for the TPRs of Earth-sized planets (Fig. 6) to extrapolate the
dependence of the TPRs on the camera counts across all mag-
nitudes and planetary radii. This results in a distribution of the
TPRs as a function of Rp, mV , and ncams.

As an aside, we ﬁnd that under the most unfavorable condi-
tions of ncams = 6 and mV = 11, TPRs near 100 % are obtained

for planets as small as 1.5 R⊕ for two transits and as small as
1.3 R⊕ for three transits.

We then multiply the resulting TPRs with our estimates of
observable transiting Earth-like planets from Sect. 2.5. We con-
sider both the (2 yr + 2 yr) and the (3 yr + 1 yr) strategies for
PLATO’s long-duration observation phase (see Sect. 2.4). Al-
though TLS can detect mono transits, its sensitivity is strongly di-
minished compared to periodic signals. Hence, we neglect mono
transits in our analysis and assume that no transits will be de-
tected during the 1 yr observation phase (see Sect. 2.4).

Our predictions of PLATO’s Earth-like planet yield are
shown in Tables 1 and 2. In Table 1, planet counts are item-
ized as per the apparent stellar magnitude bins in which we pre-
dict them (see Sect. 2.5), whereas in Table 2 planet counts are
shown as a function of the PLATO camera count. The conser-
vative and optimistic scenarios refer to diﬀerent assumptions of
the star count and HZ exoplanet occurrence rate as detailed in
Sect. 2.4. Although we are fully aware that only a full-integer
number of exoplanets can be found, we chose to present our
predictions including one decimal place given the low number
counts.

The key insight to be gained from Tables 1 and 2 is that
the (2 yr + 2 yr) observing strategy produces signiﬁcantly higher
planet yields than the (3 yr + 1 yr) observing strategy in any sce-
nario. This interpretation is supported by the total planet yield
counts in both the conservative and optimistic scenarios. The to-
tal count is 10.7 for the (2 yr + 2 yr) strategy compared to 8.0 for
the (3 yr + 1 yr) strategy in the conservative scenario. In the op-
timistic scenario, the (2 yr + 2 yr) strategy produces a predicted
yield of 33.8, whereas the (3 yr + 1 yr) strategy yields 25.4 plan-
ets. Details of the conservative versus optimistic scenarios aside,
the yield of the (2 yr + 2 yr) strategy is 133 % of the (3 yr + 1 yr)
strategy.

In addition to these actual discoveries of small planets in
the HZs around Sun-like stars, our results suggest a detection
reliability near 100 % for Earth-sized and larger planets (see
Sect. 3.1). Hence, we do not expect a signiﬁcant amount of sta-
tistical false detections, that is, false positives caused by sys-

Notes. The two diﬀerent observing strategies assume that the two long-
duration observation phase ﬁelds are monitored for either (2 yr + 2 yr)
or (3 yr + 1 yr), respectively. The conservative (optimistic) scenario as-
sumes 15,000 (20,000) Sun-like stars in the P1 sample and an occur-
rence rate of 0.37 (0.88) Earth-sized planets in the HZ per star. Planet
yields are sorted in bins of apparent stellar magnitudes (see Sect. 2.5).
Numbers are rounded to one decimal place, which leads to an oﬀset of

tematic, instrumental, or statistical eﬀects for super-Earth-sized
planets. In fact, Hippke & Heller (2019) showed that an SDE
threshold of 9 for TLS produces one statistical false positive in
about 10,000 light curves with normally distribute noise with
an amplitude of 30 ppm. Consequently, the P1 sample with its
15,000 - 20,000 stars will yield 1-2 statistical false positives.
That said, there will be about as many false detections of tran-
siting planets smaller than Earth as there will be genuine sub-
Earth-sized planets. And on top of that, there will also be false
positives caused by astrophysical eﬀects such as blended eclips-
ing binaries.

4. Discussion

4.1. Effects of observing strategy, scenario, and detection

thresholds

We ﬁnd that the choice of the observing strategy is not as impact-
ful as the realization of the conservative versus the optimistic
scenario. The realization of the conservative or the optimistic
scenario can only be aﬀected to a limited extent, for example
through the choice of the PLATO observing ﬁelds. Although
neither the dilution of exoplanet transits due to stellar blending
nor the occurrence of astrophysical false positives (e.g., from
blended eclipsing stellar binaries) have been taken into account
in our simulation, this issue has been taken care of by the PLATO
consortium by optimizing the trade-oﬀ between a high number
of priority targets and a low number of false-alarm detections
due to crowding (Rauer et al. 2014; Nascimbeni et al. 2022).
The exoplanet occurrence rate, however, which also goes into
our deﬁnition of the conservative versus optimistic scenarios, is
an observational property and needs to be taken as is.

In our injection-and-retrieval experiment, we used SDE = 9
and S/N = 7 as our nominal detection thresholds. The SDE ver-
sus S/N distributions in Figs. 4(b) and Figs. A.1(b)-A.3(b) as
well as the summary plot in Fig. 5(b) show that these thresh-
olds are suﬃcient to detect Earth-sized (and larger) planets us-

transit search with TLS, although the S/N is often substantially
above 10. The only type of false alarm signal with SDE > 9 that
we observed in our simulations is quarter jumps, but these can
be identiﬁed and dismissed. There will be other sources of false
positives for PLATO, but their quantiﬁcation is beyond the scope
of this study. As a tribute to a rigid set of SDE and S/N thresh-
olds, sub-Earth-sized planets are hard to be discriminated from
false alarms, as becomes clear in a comparison of the SDE ver-
sus S/N distribution of the injected signals in Fig. 3 with the SDE
versus S/N distribution of the control sample in Figs. B.1-B.4.
The same tribute is paid for Earth-sized planets with only two
transits (see Fig. 4(a) and Figs. A.1(a)-A.3(a)). Machine learn-
ing methods like self-organizing maps (Armstrong et al. 2017),
random forest (Armstrong et al. 2018), or convolutional neural
networks (Pearson et al. 2018; Osborn et al. 2020; Rao et al.
2021) might be helpful in the separation of genuine exoplanet
transit signals from false alarms, but for now their advantage
over smart-force search algorithms like TLS has not been con-
clusively demonstrated.

4.2. Planet yields

Our focus on the strongest transit-like signal (true or false) and
our omission of an iterative transit search down to the detection
threshold means that we underestimate TLS’s capabilities to ﬁnd
shallow transits in PLATO data. In fact, TLS can automatically
search for successively weaker signals (Hippke & Heller 2019)
and there are several ways to interpret an iterative search in terms
of true and FPRs. Though this is beyond the scope of this study
iterative transit searches will certainly be an important topic for
PLATO.

The TPRs for Earth-sized planets transiting mV = 8 Sun-
like stars are smaller than for more moderately bright stars with
mV = 9 in Figs. 5 and 6(a). We attribute this eﬀect to saturation,
which results in higher-than-realistic noise levels for the bright-
est stars. The resulting PSLS light curves are thus not represen-
tative of real PLATO light curves. That said, these stars are also
the least abundant to be observed with PLATO (see Sect. 2.5).
As a consequence, we expect the eﬀect on our expected planets
yields to be minor and (cid:46) 1 in terms of number counts for all sce-
narios. For details of the conversion between Johnson’s V-band

magnitude (mV ) and PLATO’s P magnitude used in PSLS (see
Marchiori et al. 2019).

A direct comparison of our predicted planet yields in the HZs
around Sun-like stars with those presented in the PLATO Def-
inition Study Report is complex due to several reasons. First,
this report used analytical estimates of the expected number of
planets with S/N > 10 to predict PLATO’s planet yield. For
comparison, we used simulated PLATO light curves and a tran-
sit injection-and-retrieval experiment. Second, we focused on the
P1 stellar sample and chose to represent its 15,000 - 20,000 F5-
K7 stars with Sun-like stars, including astrophysical variability.
Instead, the PLATO Deﬁnition Study Report included mV ≤ 11
stars from both the P1 and P5 sample, the latter of which will
comprise ≥ 245, 000 F5-K7 dwarf and subgiant stars (assum-
ing two long-duration observation phase ﬁeld pointings) with
mV ≤ 13 and a cadence of 600 s in most cases. Third, the esti-
mate of 6 to 280 small planets in the HZs around mV ≤ 11 stars
given in the PLATO Deﬁnition Study Report included all plan-
ets smaller than 2 R⊕. By contrast, we derive exoplanet yields for
0.5 R⊕ ≤ Rp ≤ 1.5 R⊕. Fourth, given the large observational un-
certainties at the time, the PLATO Deﬁnition Study Report nec-
essarily included a large range of the possible occurrence rates of
small planets in the HZ around Sun-like stars of between 2 % and
100 %. For comparison, our planet yield predictions are based on
updated occurrence rates estimates (Bryson et al. 2021), which
deﬁne our conservative scenario with 37 % and our optimistic
scenario with 88 %.

Our yield estimates for planets with 0.5 R⊕ ≤ Rp ≤ 1.5 R⊕
range between 11 in the conservative scenario of the (2 yr + 2 yr)
observing strategy (or 8 for the 3 yr + 1 yr observing strategy)
and 34 in the optimistic scenario of the (2 yr + 2 yr) observing
strategy (or 25 for the 3 yr + 1 yr observing strategy) (see Ta-
bles 1 and 2). With all the caveats of a direct comparison in
mind, our range of the predicted yield of small planets in the
HZ is much tighter than the previous estimates from the PLATO
Deﬁnition Study Report and tends to fall in the lower regime of
the previous planet yield estimates.

4.3. Methodological limitations and improvements

Our results demonstrate that the W¯otan detrending software ef-
ﬁciently removes stellar and systematic variability while pre-
serving transit signatures. That said, in some cases we ﬁnd that
W¯otan does not eﬀectively remove quarter jumps from PSLS
light curves. W¯otan has been designed to detrend jumps by
stitching the data prior and after gaps in the light curve, a func-
tionality that can be ﬁne-tuned using the break_tolerance
parameter. Real PLATO data will indeed have gaps of at least
several hours required for satellite repositioning, which can be
stitched with W¯otan. But PSLS does not include temporal gaps
at quarter jumps for now. This results in occasional false positive
detections with TLS at these quarter jumps, in particular for stars
with mV ≥ 10 (see Figs. A.3, B.3, and B.4).

In the ﬁnal data products of the actual PLATO mission, quar-
ter jumps will be subjected to a dedicated light curve stitching.
As a consequence, this type of false positives will not, or very
rarely, be an issue. As explained in Sect. 3.1, this is why we ne-
glect quarterly false positives in our summary plots (Figs. 5-7).
Nevertheless, since we did not attempt to sort out false positives
detected with TLS at quarterly jumps and then rerun TLS, we can
expect that the TPRs derived with TLS in such an iterative man-
ner could actually be higher than shown in Figs. 5 and 6. As a
consequence, the application of TLS on a set of light curves that

were properly corrected for quarter jumps can be expected to
produce slightly higher planet yields than in Tables 1 and 2.

PSLS (v1.3) includes long-term drift correction. It corrects
for the drift in the CCD positions of the stars due to relativis-
tic velocity aberration and satellite motion. It does not currently
take into account, however, any detrending of the light curves
from jitter, CCD positional changes from thermal trends induced
by spacecraft rotation every three months, regular thermal per-
turbations caused by the daily data transfer, momentum wheel
desaturation, residual outliers not detected by the outlier detec-
tion algorithms, or the stitching of parts of the light curves be-
tween mask updates – the last of which is irrelevant for P1 sam-
ple stars since their photometry will be extracted using a ﬁtting
of the point spread function. Although W¯otan can be expected to
remove most of these trends in a reasonable manner while pre-
serving transit signatures, the actual data products of the PLATO
mission will be subjected to a detailed detrending of systematic
eﬀects. In terms of detrending of systematic eﬀects (but not nec-
essarily of astrophysical variability), the real PLATO data will
therefore have a somewhat better quality for transit searches than
the PSLS light curves that we used.

On the down side, our simulations assume near-continuous
uptime and uninterrupted functionality of the PLATO satellite.
This might be overly optimistic as demonstrated by the Kepler
mission, which achieved an average of ∼ 90 % time on target.
Unplanned downtimes of PLATO might outbalance the beneﬁts
of improved systematic detrending so that our values in Tables 1
and 2 would remain almost unaﬀected.

We restricted our study to stars with solar-like activity, while
the actual stars to be observed in the P1 sample will naturally
exhibit a range of activity patterns. An analysis of the ﬁrst six
months of continuous observations of moderately bright stars
(Kepler magnitudes 10.5 ≤ Kp ≤ 11.5) from the Kepler primary
mission showed that solar-type stars are intrinsically more active
than previously thought (Gilliland et al. 2011), a result later con-
ﬁrmed with the ﬁnal four years of Kepler observations (Gilliland
et al. 2015). Our assumptions of solar-like activity might thus be
overly optimistic. This might have a negative eﬀect on the planet
yields that we estimate since transit signatures of small planets
are harder to ﬁnd around photometrically more active stars. Sim-
ulations of PLATO-like light curves with more realistic intrinsic
stellar variability is, in principle, possible with PSLS. For now,
PSLS requires a user-deﬁned parameterization of stellar activity
but future versions are planned to implement empirical descrip-
tions of the magnetic activity to suit PLATO solar-like oscillators
(Samadi et al. 2019). Moreover, rotational modulation caused by
spots on the surface of the star are not yet implemented in PSLS.
We did not simulate a representative population of 15,000 to
20,000 F5-K7 stars with mV ≤ 11 as will be observed in PLATO’s
P1 stellar sample. Instead, we assumed a solar-type star with
solar radius and mass, investigated four apparent stellar magni-
tudes mV ∈ {8, 9, 10, 11} for reference simulations with PSLS,
and weighted the abundance of stars in one-magnitude bins
around these reference magnitudes (Sect. 2.5). There are at least
three caveats with this assumption. First, the apparent magnitude
distribution of the P1 sample will likely diﬀer from that of ﬁeld
stars, with a drop between mV = 10 and mV = 11 since the outer,
low-camera-count regions of PLATO’s ﬁeld of view are not able
to meet the noise limit requirement of 50 ppm per hour integra-
tion (V. Nascimbeni, priv. comm.). Second, Sun-like stars will
likely be underrepresented compared to more early-type stars in
the P1 sample. The median stellar radius in the P1 sample will
likely be closer to 1.3 R(cid:12) (Montalto et al. 2021), roughly cor-
responding to spectral type F0 on the main sequence. The HZ

A&A proofs: manuscript no. 41640corr

will be farther away from the star than in our simulations and
the orbital period will be larger than 1 yr. And third, the P1 sam-
ple is not supposed to be evenly distributed over PLATO’s NPF
and SPF due to the noise limit requirement. Instead, the P1 sam-
ple stars will be concentrated in the inner part of the NPF and
SPF, where they are covered by 18 or 24 telescopes. In sum-
mary, we expect that (1) the apparent magnitude distribution of
the P1 sample stars will be skewed more toward brighter stars
than based on our Gaia counts of ﬁelds stars (Sect. 2.5), (2) tran-
sits of Earth-sized planets in the HZs around P1 sample stars
will typically be shallower and have longer orbital periods than
the transits around nominal Sun-like stars in our simulations, and
(3) the P1 sample stars will preferentially be observed with 18
or 24 cameras. Since points (1) and (3) have an opposite eﬀect
on the planet yield to point (2) it is impossible, based on the cur-
rently available data, to specify the resulting eﬀect on the actual
planet yield presented in this paper.

In all our transit simulations, we assumed a transit impact pa-
rameter of zero, that is, that the planet crosses the star along the
apparent stellar diameter. In reality, however, the average tran-
sit impact parameter for a large sample of transiting planets is
π/4 ∼ 79 % of that value (Jenkins et al. 2002). As a result, we
overestimate the average transit duration (and therefore the re-
sulting S/N) around a large sample of Sun-like stars systemati-
cally. That said, this eﬀect is mitigated by the longer transit du-
rations expected for HZ planets in the P1 sample, as explained
above.

5. Conclusions

We have developed a procedure to estimate the yield of Earth-
like planets in the HZs around Sun-like stars from the PLATO
mission. In brief, we simulated PLATO-like light curves, some
of which included transits, with the PSLS software, performed
a detrending from systematic and astrophysical variability with
the W¯otan software, and then searched for the injected signals
with the TLS search algorithm. We combined our measurements
of the TPRs with the expected number of stars in PLATO’s P1
stellar sample of bright (mV ≤ 11) stars and with modern esti-
mates for the occurrence rate of Earth-sized planets in the HZs
around Sun-like stars to predict PLATO’s exoplanet yield. We
investigated the (2 yr + 2 yr) and the (3 yr + 1 yr) observation
strategies for PLATO’s long-duration observation phase ﬁelds.

We ﬁnd that under the same simulation conditions the
(2 yr + 2 yr) observing strategy results in signiﬁcantly enhanced
planet yields compared to the (3 yr + 1 yr) strategy. Details of the
exact numbers for both strategies depend on the actual number
of stars that will be observed in the P1 sample and on the occur-
rence rate of small planets in the HZs around Sun-like stars.

Under the assumption of a Sun-like star with low stellar ac-
tivity, we ﬁnd that PLATO can detect planets with radii ≥ 1.2 R⊕
with TPR ∼100 % in the P1 sample (mV ≤ 11) if two tran-
sits can be observed synchronously by 24 PLATO cameras.
When a third transit is added under otherwise unchanged condi-
tions, TPR ∼100 % is achieved for planet as small as Earth. True
positive rates of a few percent for planets as small as 0.8 R⊕ in
one-year orbits around bright Sun-like stars from the P1 sample
suggest that this is the minimum planet size that can be detected,
in some rare and photometrically optimal cases, if two transits
are observed. If three transits are available, planets as small as
0.7 R⊕ may be detectable in rare cases.

Assuming the most unfavorable conditions in our setup with
only six PLATO cameras and transits in front of the dimmest
Sun-like stars in PLATO’s P1 sample (mV = 11), TPRs near

Article number, page 12 of 19

100 % are nevertheless achieved for planets as small as 1.5 R⊕
for two transits and as small as 1.3 R⊕ for three transits around
solar-type stars. Again, these estimates all assume low, Sun-like
photometric variability.

Using the Sun as a proxy, we predict the detection of be-
tween 8 and 34 Earth-like planets in the HZs around F5-K7
main-sequence stars with 0.5 R⊕ ≤ Rp ≤ 1.5 R⊕. These es-
timates should be considered an upper limit for several reasons.
First, given that PLATO’s P1 sample stars will typically be larger
than the Sun-like benchmark stars in our simulations (Montalto
et al. 2021), the resulting transits of Earth-like planets in the HZ
will be shallower and less frequent than we simulated. Second,
astrophysical false positives, which we neglected, and as yet un-
known systematic eﬀects of the PLATO mission might increase
the FPR and complicate the identiﬁcation of genuine transits, in
particular given the low number of transits expected for Earth-
like planets in the HZs around Sun-like stars. Third, and maybe
most importantly, all our estimates are based on simulations of
photometrically quiet Sun-like stars, whereas in reality most F5-
K7 main-sequence stars are photometrically more variable. On
the other hand, a more sophisticated correction of systematic ef-
fects and astrophysical variability, more elaborate vetting than a
mere SDE-S/N cut, a bias of the P1 stellar sample toward bright
stars covered with 18 or 24 cameras, and serendipitous discov-
eries in PLATO’s P2–P5 stellar samples could lead to additional
discoveries that are not considered in our estimates.

Our results suggest that PLATO can achieve its science ob-
jective of ﬁnding Earth-like planets in the HZs around Sun-like
stars. The prediction of the discovery of 8–34 such worlds means
a substantial step forward from the previously available esti-
mates that ranged between 6 and 280. Nevertheless, our new
estimates worryingly remind us of the initial predictions for the
number of Earth-like planets to be discovered with NASA’s Ke-
pler mission, which ﬂuctuated around 50 over the years (Borucki
et al. 1996; Borucki 2016). These estimates for Kepler relied on
the Sun as a proxy for stellar variability, which turned out to be
an overly optimistic approach. Hence, our results require follow-
up studies of PLATO’s expected planet yield with more realistic
stellar variability. If shallow transit detection can be achieved
in the presence of signiﬁcant stellar variability, then our results
suggest that PLATO’s detections will mean a major contribution
to this as yet poorly sampled regime of the exoplanet parame-
ter space with Earth-sized planets in the HZs around solar-type
stars.

Appendix A: SDE versus S/N for Earth-sized planets and 24 PLATO cameras

As an extension of Fig. 4 we provide the SDE versus S/N distribution of transiting Earth-like planets around more moderately bright

Appendix B: SDE versus S/N for 24 PLATO cameras without injections

In addition to the SDE versus SDE diagrams for our injection-and-retrieval tests, we also generated similar plots for the control
sample of light curves, which did not contain any injected transits. These simulations are key to determining the TNRs and FPRs
shown in Fig. 7. The following plots are all based on simulated PSLS observations with 24 PLATO cameras. Figure B.1 refers to
mV = 8, Fig. B.2 refers to mV = 9, Fig. B.3 refers to mV = 10, and Fig. B.4 refers to mV = 11.

Appendix C: Transits in the presence of stellar activity

Throughout our study we have assumed a Sun-like star with solar activity levels. This assumption had also been made prior to the
Kepler mission and unfortunately the analysis of stellar activity levels of the Kepler stars has shown that this assumption was too
optimistic. As it turned out, the Sun is a relatively quiet star, from the perspective of photometric variability (Gilliland et al. 2011,
2015). The underestimation of stellar variability prior to the Kepler mission is now seen as a main reason for why the mission could
not achieve the detection of an Earth-sized planet with three transits, that is, in a one-year orbit around a solar-type star. PLATO
will naturally face the same challenges. Although a detailed investigation of the eﬀects of stellar variability on transit detectability
is beyond the scope of this manuscript, we have executed a limited qualitative study.

In discussing stellar activity in the context of exoplanet transits, various metrics are in use throughout the community. For
example, García et al. (2014) measure (cid:104)S ph,k(cid:105), the mean standard deviation in a running window with a width corresponding to k
times the rotation period of a given star. As such, (cid:104)S ph,k(cid:105) correlates with the amplitude of the stellar activity component used in the
simulations with PSLS (σA) (Douaglin 2018), which is given in Eq. (37) in Samadi et al. (2019). Beyond stellar activity, (cid:104)S ph,k(cid:105)
takes into account any kind of instrumental or systematic error in the light curves and, hence, has the tendency to exceed the stellar
activity component. In our analysis we take a similar approach and measure the combined noise level as the standard deviation in
a sliding window with a width of 1 hr (σ1 hr), which is the reference timescale for the computation of the noise-to-signal budgets in
the PLATO mission (Rauer et al. 2014). As an aside, another alternative metric was used by the Kepler mission, which applied the
“combined diﬀerential photometric precision” (Jenkins et al. 2010).

To examine transits in light curves with diﬀerent stellar activity levels, we simulated three stars of solar radius with increasing
stellar activity levels and on diﬀerent characteristic timescales: (1) σA = 40 ppm and τA = 0.8 d; (2) σA = 166 ppm and τA = 0.5 d;
and (3) σA = 500 ppm and τA = 0.3 d. The choice of the timescale is motivated by ﬁndings of Hulot et al. (2011), who measured
the characteristic timescales for the evolution of stellar activity. As an aside, τA used in PSLS corresponds to the timescales of Hulot
et al. (2011) divided by 2π. As for the activity levels, we refer to García et al. (2014), who determined for the Sun that (cid:104)S ph,k(cid:105),
referred to as its photometric magnetic activity level, ranges between 89 ppm and 259 ppm with a reference value of 166 ppm.

For each star, we generated 40 light curves with two transits of an Earth-like planet and an equal amount of light curves without
transits. In each light curve we measured the sliding standard deviation in a 1 hr window as a proxy for the combined activity on
that timescale (σ1 hr). All simulations assumed an apparent stellar magnitude of mV = 9 and coverage by 24 PLATO cameras. Our
measurements of σ1 hr for the three benchmark stars are given in Table C.1. In Figs. C.1 - C.3 we show some examples of the
resulting light curves, each of which includes a transit of an Earth-like planet. In our preliminary analysis, we found that the transit
detectability with TLS upon detrending with W¯otan depends sensitively on σA but weakly on τA. As we quantiﬁed in a limited
injection-recovery test, shallow transits of Earth-sized planets are securely recovered around the quiet benchmark star (Fig. C.1) but
a large fraction of them gets lost in the stellar activity around even the moderately active benchmark star (Fig. C.2) and they become
entirely undetectable around the more active stars (Fig. C.3). These ﬁndings illustrate that our estimates of PLATO planet yield,
which we derived using a photometrically quiet star, must be seen as upper limits.

Notes. The parameters σA and τA are used in PSLS to characterize the amplitude and timescale of stellar activity (Samadi et al. 2019). For
comparison, σ1 hr is the mean standard deviation that we extracted in a running 1 hr window from the light curves. For each combination of σA and
τA we simulated 40 light curves.

Fig. C.1. Four example light curves generated with PSLS with a transit of an Earth-like planet around a solar-sized star with weak photometric
activity (σA = 40 ppm, τA = 0.8 d). The light curves assumed synchronous observations with 24 PLATO cameras and mV = 9. The duration of the
transit is indicated with two vertical black bars spanning a window of 12 hr around the mid-transit time.
