Abstract— Emerging advanced control applications, with in-
creased complexity in software but limited computing resources,
suggest that real-time controllers should have adaptable de-
signs. These control strategies also should be designed with
consideration of the run-time behavior of the system. One
of such research attempts is to design the controller along
with the task scheduler, known as control-scheduling co-design,
for more predictable timing behavior as well as surviving
system overloads. Unlike traditional controller designs, which
have equal-distance sampling periods, the co-design approach
increases the system ﬂexibility and resilience by explicitly
considering timing properties, for example using an event-
based controller or with multiple sampling times (non-uniform
sampling and control). Within this context, we introduce the
ﬁrst work on the discretization of an energy-based controller
that can switch arbitrarily between multiple periods and adjust
the control parameters accordingly without destabilizing the
system. A digital controller design based on this paradigm for
a DC motor with an elastic load as an example is introduced and
the stability condition is given based on the proposed Lyapunov
function. The method is evaluated with various computer-based
simulations which demonstrate its effectiveness.

I. INTRODUCTION

Utilising computational resources efﬁciently is important
for emerging systems that have complex functionalities but
with limited on-board computing resources, for example,
autonomous mobile robots and self-driving vehicles. In the
control systems community,
traditional controller design
rarely takes computing resources into consideration. For
instance, in computer-based control, the discrete controller
is often designed with the assumption that the control task,
i.e. the program that runs the controller code on an embedded
is executed with equal-distance sampling and
computer,
control
the discrete controller is directly
derived based on the period from the continuous controller
design. These, however, (a) limit the ﬂexibility of software
and scheduling; and (b) degrade the control performance if
the actual sampling/control intervals are different.

intervals. Also,

From the task scheduling perspective, historically, tasks
are scheduled with more deterministic policies, e.g. cyclic
executives [1], [2]. These policies have less ﬂexibility but
with more timing predictability that the real-time controller
can be executed with a relatively stable sampling time and
jitter. However, as the computing architecture becomes more
complicated and demanding for more functionalities, the exe-
cution environment soon becomes more dynamic. This issue

brings both challenges and opportunities for the design of
digital controllers. In recent years, there is ongoing research
to support control scheduling co-design [3], [4], in which the
computation resources are taken into consideration explicitly
during the design of the real-time controller. Pioneering
works have shown that event-based control is comparable
to periodic control
in [5]–[8] that can signiﬁcantly save
computing and energy resources.

Recently, it has been realized in both the control and
scheduling communities that real-time controllers can run
at different frequencies (and hence so does the control task
that executes the control-related functions) [9], [10]. This
brings opportunities for real-time embedded control systems
to adapt the control period in accordance with the current
system workload to satisfy task schedulability and avoid
overloading the system. Note that we assume sampling time
(the time interval in which the controller updates its current
states; which is not necessarily equal to the actual sampling
rate of the sensor) equals the control period; hence, we
use control period and sampling period interchangeably. We
also use the term interval and period interchangeably as the
semantics are identical in this paper.

Unlike the more traditional mode switching control, period
switching focuses on adapting different control periods,
rather than switching between a set of controllers with
pre-designed tuned parameters. As the task utilization is
equal to its worst-case execution time divided by its inter-
release interval (task period), adapting the interval can have
a signiﬁcant impact on computing resource usage and the
overall system’s energy consumption.

On the other hand, energy-based control [11]–[13] is not
explored as much as proportional-integral-derivative (PID)
control [14], [15] or state feedback control [16], [17]. With
physical systems, energy-based control is often more intuitive
as it explores the internal dynamics of the physical process.
It supports non-linear systems as well as underactuated
systems [18] and has large regional convergence compared
to controllers designed with pole-placement. It can naturally
support non-uniform sampling and it should be easier to
stabilize in this case. We think that because the convergence
of the physical system can be derived with dependency on
sampling time, it should be easier to develop stable control
strategies for these time-varying systems. Also, this fact was
conﬁrmed in insightful studies of motor systems with ﬂexible
loads [19]–[21] where an energy-based control strategy was
able to stabilize the whole system under physical/virtual
constraints.

To fulﬁll the requirement of control-scheduling co-design,
a vital step is to discretize the real-time controller, which

 
 
 
 
 
 
is to transform the system dynamics from continuous-time
to discrete-time as a function of the sampling period. Con-
trollers with non-uniform sampling can be important in phys-
ical systems [17], and developing a discrete-time controller
can improve the response, save energy and minimise the
anomalies when sampling frequencies are altered. Histori-
cally, the energy-based controller has largely been addressed
in the continuous-time domain while the transformation
into discrete-time is not studied that much. For example,
pioneering research was developed as the ﬁrst discretized
energy-based controller for an underactuated system with
variable disturbances [22]. In our work, we leverage the
control-scheduling co-design by providing discretization of
energy-based control, that can be used for the purpose of
robust, adaptive and ﬂexible task scheduling [23].

This paper is organized as follows: we develop the DC mo-
tor model with elastic load and its discretization in Section II.
Next, we introduce the design of a discrete energy-based
controller in Section III and derive its stability conditions. An
evaluation with simulation is given in Section IV, followed
by concluding remarks and a discussion of future work in
Section V.

II. ENERGY-BASED CONTROLLER DESIGN
In this section, we ﬁrst present the model of the DC motor
with an elastic load. Then, we demonstrate the discretized
model with its general relations due to the Maclaurin series
approximation.

A. Model of a DC Motor System

We consider a DC motor model with attached elastic load,
stiffness KL and viscous friction BL, as shown in Fig. 1. The
equations of motion for this DC motor are [21], [24], [25]:

where hk = tk − tk−1 is the sampling time at k-th sample.
The reason to use an exponential model rather than z-
transformation is to facilitate the inclusion of the sampling
time as a variable in the time domain. Then, we deﬁne expo-
nential matrix operations for (4)-(5) by using the Maclaurin
series as follows

III. ARBITRARY SWITCHING WITH ENERGY-BASED
CONTROLLER

In this section, we derive a discrete energy-based con-
troller for an arbitrary switching mode. Also, we explain
how certain controller gains get updated based on arbitrary
sampling time to improve the convergence while the system
is maintained stable.

In this control problem, we assume that system (4) with
states xk is controlled to converge toward the desired states
xd. The system (4) is assumed to have a random sampling
time hk that changes continuously. The aim is to keep the
system stable during the converges with changing sampling
time hk. Now, we develop the following proposition for our
energy-based controller with stable converges as follows:

Proposition 1 Assume the discrete system deﬁned by
Eqs. (4)-(5) has a random sampling time hk in k-th sample.
Then, the physical system converges to the desired states xd

The new function candidate V (cid:48) should be stable around
equilibrium with satisfying LaSalle’s theorem. It can be seen,
the function in Eq. (17) is positive deﬁnite, thus, we can have
following condition for stable convergence

Now, the new discrete energy equation that encompasses the
discrete state-space model using (4)-(5) with sampling period

To prove the stability condition (21) for (20), we represent
the following new terms A∗ = −A and F∗

the inequality (21) can be computed as follows

Inequality (22) clariﬁes the constraints on control gains and
sampling time hk in establishing a stable controller. Based
on the transitivity and addition properties of the inequalities
we can divide the inequality to two parts as:

(16)

where {θd, ˙θd} are the desired angular position and velocity
of the motor shaft. In (17), the ﬁrst term is for converging
the overall energy to zero while the other two terms converge
the system to desired position and velocity. It is clear that the

Because the system is always convergent to the desired states,
V2 is always satisﬁed. Also, V1 with normalized parameters
and constant I and θ can be shown as Fig. 2 where it is
clear that system should stay in a stable region if kP (cid:29) kD

becomes harder in small sampling times hk when kP is not
that high.

The stability regarding the sampling time hk from (22)

(24)

Thus, the controller gains should be satisﬁed by inequalities
(24) based on the range of change for the sampling time hk
to always stay in the stable region. Finally, by equating (20)
to zero, the energy-based control input (11) can be found.

larities which are located in two conditions

in (19) is an important part of the controller that is a function
of hk. Also, as the sampling time hk variable changes,
E(cid:48) function varies that can create instabilities in controller
output uk. To solve this issue, we assume that the controller
is designed with the standard sampling time hs which results
in a standard energy difference of

(26)

where kE,s is the standard constant energy gain for the
standard sampling hs. Then, by considering an arbitrary
sampling hk, kE is updated as follows:

where εh and εc are constant small values. These conditions
should always be satisﬁed to prevent the controller from
becoming saturated. The condition (25) shows that the lower
the sampling time is determined by εh <
boundary of
hk where εh is a constant small value. Also, if the sum
of the squared angular displacement, velocity and motor
current, as shown in the condition (26), becomes very small
(near zero) where εc is a very small constant value, there
appear singularities. Also, (26) imposes another constraint
to geometric parameters of the physical system i.e., J, K
and L, that cannot be lower than a certain value.

To provide complete stability through mode switching in
sampling time and desired states, aforementioned conditions
should be satisﬁed and control variables should be designed
accordingly. As we expect to have a random sampling time
hk ∈ [hmin, hmax] the model (4) should always be stable;
hence, the minimum hmin and the maximum hmax sampling
time can be determined from (24) (as shown in Fig. 2) based
on the physical parameters of the considered model.

Next, we develop a tuning dynamic kE gain to keep the
system in smooth and robust convergence while stability is
satisﬁed with randomly changing sampling time. This issue
is important because random sampling will act as disturbance
to whole system dynamics and can create a divergence in the
states. The ﬁrst term of the Lyapunov function kEEkE(cid:48)(hk)

kE(hk) = E(cid:48)

s/E(cid:48)(hk) + Kc,

(28)

where Kc is a constant small value. Eq. (28) prevents the
controller from producing large control values when the
sampling time shifts suddenly with large deviations. The
stability of the newly developed dynamic gain can be found
by substituting (28) to (22) that results

which keeps the system in a stable region. When the kD term
becomes dominant in smaller values of hk as shown in (24),
the dynamic kE gets larger to create a trade off and keeping
the condition (29) always valid.

IV. EVALUATION

In this section, we study the proposed controller’s be-
havior for the DC motor model using simulation. In order
to demonstrate the behavior, we implement the introduced
energy-based controller in MATLAB. Table I shows the used
parameters for this experiment. The motor is assumed to
have initial state {θ0, ˙θ0, I0} = {0.1, 5, 0.4} and the system
is expected to converge to the rest state { ˙θd, Id} = {0, 0}

while the position arrives at its desired value θd = 2 rad.
Based on the constraints for sampling period hk in (24)
the random sampling range is chosen as
and (25)-(26),
hk ∈ [hmin, hmax] = [0.05, 0.2] s. It is important to note
that in this arbitrary sampling for each iteration hk, the
number of times that sampling time changes is also random.
The controller gains are also determined under the stability
conditions with values given in Table I.

Figs. 3-4 illustrate the simulation results for three different
runs of random sampling. The developed discrete energy-
based controller can successfully converge the system to
desired states while sampling time is randomly altered for
all cases (see Fig. 5 for details).

Fig. 4 presents how the energy is minimized towards the
desired states convergence. The same behavior is observed

for the controller inputs without having any saturation.

Additionally, during the transition state, the controller is
prone to have more ﬂuctuations when the sampling time
changes more often with large values. This can be observed
clearly for the second random sampling case (the plot in
red) where dynamic kE gain is getting re-tuned by (28) as
a large value before 1 s (see Fig. 6). This large value of kE
prevents the controller input from saturation which shows
the developed controller works ﬂawlessly.

To demonstrate that the controller with dynamic kE gain
has important advantages, we make a comparison with a
case where the gain kE is assigned a constant value. Fig. 7
illustrates an example result of system convergence with
random sampling time presented in Fig. 8. It is clear that
our designed controller with dynamic gain kE can converge
all the states to desired values but kE with constant gain fails
to arrive at desired angular state θf , which is 2 rad.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have introduced a discrete energy-
based controller that supports non-uniform digital control,
which contributes to the research of control and scheduling
co-design. In this work, before developing the controller,

the discrete state-space model was presented. A physical
system (a DC motor) with elastic load and its model were
introduced. Then, the energy-based controller with arbitrary
switching was proposed where constraints under the stability
condition of the overall Lyapunov function are found for
controller gains. A new re-tuning function based on the
sampling period is developed for the gain of the energy
term to stabilize during the ﬂexible switching. This work
shows that the designed discrete energy-based controller can
successfully converge the system into the desired states while
the sampling time is randomly changing.

In addition to what was presented in this paper, some
further improvements can be made, including: (i) introduce
a switch supervisor that chooses when and how to switch
between multiple periods; (ii) constrain the periods to a
pre-deﬁned set with a harmonic period to facilitate task
scheduling and allocation; and (iii) explore other control
strategies to extend the problem to digital systems without
any physical properties, which was required in this energy-
based controller. All of these will be form part of future
work.
