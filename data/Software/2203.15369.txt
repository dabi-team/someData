ABSTRACT
We conduct an exploratory, large-scale, longitudinal study of 50
years of commits to publicly available version control system repos-
itories, in order to characterize the geographic diversity of contrib-
utors to public code and its evolution over time. We analyze in total
2.2 billion commits collected by Software Heritage from 160 million
projects and authored by 43 million authors during the 1971–2021
time period. We geolocate developers to 12 world regions derived
from the United Nation geoscheme, using as signals email top-level
domains, author names compared with names distributions around
the world, and UTC offsets mined from commit metadata.

We find evidence of the early dominance of North America in
open source software, later joined by Europe. After that period, the
geographic diversity in public code has been constantly increas-
ing. We also identify relevant historical shifts related to the UNIX
wars, the increase of coding literacy in Central and South Asia, and
broader phenomena like colonialism and people movement across
countries (immigration/emigration).

1 INTRODUCTION
Gender diversity, or more often its lack thereof, among participants
to software development activities has been thoroughly studied in
recent years. In particular, the presence of, effects of, and counter-
measures for gender bias in Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) have
received a lot of attention over the past decade [2, 13, 16, 18, 21,
24, 30, 31, 33]. Geographic diversity is on the other hand the kind
of diversity that stems from participants in some global activity
coming from different world regions and cultures.

Geographic diversity in FOSS has received relatively little atten-
tion in scholarly works. In particular, while seminal survey-based
and point-in-time medium-scale studies of the geographic origins
of FOSS contributors exist [2, 6, 7, 25, 29, 32], large-scale longi-
tudinal studies of the geographic origin of FOSS contributors are
still lacking. Such a quantitative characterization would be useful
to inform decisions related to global development teams [8] and
hiring strategies in the information technology (IT) market, as well
as contribute factual information to the debates on the economic
impact and sociology of FOSS around the world.

Contributions. With this work we contribute to close this gap
by conducting the first longitudinal study of the geographic
origin of contributors to public code over 50 years. Specifi-
cally, we provide a preliminary answer to the following research
question:

RQ 1. From which world regions do authors of publicly available
commits come from and how has it changed over the past 50 years?

We use as dataset the Software Heritage archive [3] and analyze
from it 2.2 billion commits archived from 160 million projects and
authored by 43 million authors during the 1971–2021 time period.
We geolocate developers to 12 world regions, using as signals email
country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) and author (first/last)
names compared with name distributions around the world, and
UTC offsets mined from commit metadata.

We find evidence of the early dominance of North America in
open source software, later joined by Europe. After that period, the
geographic diversity in public code has been constantly increasing.
We also identify relevant historical shifts related to the end of the
UNIX wars and the increase of coding literacy in Central and South
Asia, as well as of broader phenomena like colonialism and people
movement across countries (immigration/emigration).

2 RELATED WORK
Both early and recent works [2, 6, 18, 25] have characterized the
geography of Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) using developer
surveys, which provide high-quality answers but are limited in size
(2-5 K developers) and can be biased by participant sampling.

In 2008 Barahona et al. [7] conducted a seminal large-scale (for
the time) study on FOSS geography using mining software reposito-
ries (MSR) techniques. They analyzed the origin of 1 M contributors
using the SourceForge user database and mailing list archives over
the 1999–2005 period, using as signals information similar to ours:

 
 
 
 
 
 
MSR ’22, May 23–24, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

email domains and UTC offsets. The studied period (7 years) in [7]
is shorter than what is studied in the present paper (50 years) and
the data sources are largely different; with that in mind, our re-
sults show a slightly larger quote of European v. North American
contributions.

Another empirical work from 2010 by Takhteyev and Hilts [29]
harvested self-declared geographic locations of GitHub accounts
recursively following their connections, collecting information for
≈ 70 K GitHub users. A very recent work [32] by Wachs et al. has
geolocated half a million GitHub users, having contributed at least
100 commits each, and who self-declare locations on their GitHub
profiles. While the study is point-in-time as of 2021, the authors
compare their findings against [7, 29] to characterize the evolution
of FOSS geography over the time snapshots taken by the three
studies.

Compared with previous empirical works, our study is much
larger scale—having analyzed 43 million authors of 2.2 billion com-
mits from 160 million projects—longitudinal over 50 years of public
code contributions rather than point in time, and also more fine-
grained (with year-by-year granularity over the observed period).
Methodologically, our study relies on Version Control System (VCS)
commit data rather than platform-declared location information.
Other works—in particular the work by Daniel [1] and, more
recently, Rastogi et al. [20, 22, 23]—have studied geographic diver-
sity and bias, i.e., the extent to which the origin of FOSS developers
affect their collaborative coding activities. In this work we charac-
terized geographic diversity in public code for the first time at this
scale, both in terms of contributors and observation period. We do
not tackle the bias angle, but provide empirical data and findings
that can be leveraged to that end as future work.

Global software engineering [8] is the sub-field of software en-
gineering that has analyzed the challenges of scaling developer
collaboration globally, including the specific concern of how to deal
with geographic diversity [5, 9]. Decades later the present study
provides evidence that can be used, in the specific case of public
code and at a very large scale, to verify which promises of global
software engineering have borne fruit.

3 METHODOLOGY

Dataset. We retrieved from Software Heritage [19] all commits
archived until 2021-07-07. They amount to 2 198 808 389 commits,
unique by SHA1 identifier, harvested from about 160 million public
projects coming from major development forges (GitHub, GitLab,
etc.) and package repositories (Debian, PyPI, NPM, etc.). Commits
in the dataset are by 43 381 366 authors, unique by ⟨name, email⟩
pairs. The dataset came as two relational tables, one for commits
and one for authors, with the former referencing the latter via a
foreign key. For each entry in the author table we have author full
name and email as two separate strings of raw bytes.

We removed implausible or unusable names that: are not decod-
able as UTF-8 (4127 author names removed), are email addresses
instead of names (84 954 “names”), consist of only blank characters
(25 055), contain more than 10% non-letters (9 915 884), are longer
than 100 characters (46). After filtering, about 33 M authors (77%
of the initial dataset) remained for further analysis.

Figure 1: Yearly public commits over time (log scale).

Figure 2: The 12 world regions used as geolocation targets.

Note that the amount of public code commits (and authors)
contained in the initial dataset grows exponentially over time [28],
as shown for commits in Figure 1. As a consequence the observed
trends tend to be more stable in recent decades than in 40+ year-old
ones, due to statistics taken on exponentially larger populations.

Geolocation. As geolocation targets we use macro world regions
derived from the United Nations geoscheme [17]. To avoid domina-
tion by large countries (e.g., China or Russia) within macro regions,
we merged and split some regions based on geographic proximity
and the sharing of preeminent cultural identification features, such
as spoken language. Figure 2 shows the final list of 12 world regions
used as geolocation targets in this study.

Geolocation of commit authors to world regions uses the two
complementary techniques introduced in [27], briefly recalled be-
low. The first one relies on the country code top-level domain
(ccTLD) of email addresses extracted from commit metadata, e.g.,
.fr, .ru, .cn, etc. We started from the IANA list of Latin character
ccTLDs [11] and manually mapped each corresponding territory to
a target world region.

The second geolocation technique uses the UTC offset of commit
timestamps (e.g., UTC-05:00) and author names to determine the
most likely world region of the commit author. For each UTC offset

we determine a list of compatible places (country, state, or depen-
dent territory) in the world that, at the time of that commit, had that
UTC offset; commit time is key here, as country UTC offsets vary
over time due to timezone changes. To make this determination we
use the IANA time zone database [10].

Then we assign to each place a score that captures the likelihood
that a given author name is characteristic of it. To this end we use
the Forebears dataset of the frequencies of the most common first
and family names which, quoting from [4]: “provides the approxi-
mate incidence of forenames and surnames produced from a database
of 4 044 546 938 people (55.5% of living people in 2014). As of Septem-
ber 2019 it covers 27 662 801 forenames and 27 206 821 surnames in
236 jurisdictions.” As in our dataset authors are full name strings
(rather than split by first/family name), we first tokenize names
(by blanks and case changes) and then lookup individual tokens
in both first and family names frequency lists. For each element
found in name lists we multiply the place population1 by the name
frequency to obtain a measure that is proportional to the number
of persons bearing that name (token) in the specific place. We
sum this figure for all elements to obtain a place score, ending up
with a list of ⟨place, score⟩ pairs. We then partition this list by the
world region that a place belongs to and sum the score for all the
places in each region to obtain an overall score, corresponding to
the likelihood that the commit belongs to a given world region. We
assign the starting commit as coming from the world region with
the highest score.

The email-based technique suffers from the limited and unbal-
anced use of ccTLDs: most developers use generic TLDs such as
.com, .org, or .net. Moreover this does not happen uniformly
across zones: US-based developers, for example, use the .us ccTLD
much more seldomly than their European counterparts. On the
other hand the offset/name-based technique relies on the UTC
offset of the commit timestamps. Due to tool configurations on
developer setups, a large number of commits in the dataset has an
UTC offset equal to zero. This affects less recent commits (22% of
2020s commits have a zero offset) than older ones (96% in 2000). As
a result the offset/name-based technique could end up detecting
a large share of older commits as authored by African developers,
and to a lesser extent Europeans.

To counter these issues we combine the two geolocation tech-
niques together by applying the offset/name-based techniques to
all commits with a non-zero UTC offset, and the email-based on to
all other commits.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To answer RQ 1 we gathered the number of commits and distinct au-
thors per year and per world zone. We present the obtained results
in Figure 3 as two stacked bar charts, showing yearly breakdowns
for commits and authors respectively. Every bar represents a year
and is partitioned in slices showing the commit/author ratio for
each of the world regions of Figure 2 in that year. To avoid outliers
due to sporadic contributors, in the author chart we only consider
authors having contributed at least 5 commits in a given year.

1To obtain population totals—as the notion of “place” is heterogeneous: full countries
v. slices of large countries spanning multiple timezones—we use a mixture of primary
sources (e.g., government websites), and non-primary ones (e.g., Wikipedia articles).

While observing trends in the charts remember that the total
numbers of commits and authors grow exponentially over time.
Hence for the first years in the charts, the number of data points in
some world regions can be extremely small, with negative conse-
quences on the stability of trends.

Geographic diversity over time. Overall, the general trend appears
to be that the geographic diversity in public code is increasing:
North America and Europe alternated their “dominance” until the
middle of the 90s; from that moment on most other world regions
show a slow but steady increment. This trend of increased partici-
pation into public code development includes Central and South
Asia (comprising India), Russia, Africa, Central and South America,
Notice that also zones that do not seem to follow this trend, such as
Australia and New Zealand, are also increasing their participation,
but at a lower speed with respect to other zones. For example, Aus-
tralia and New Zealand incremented the absolute number of their
commits by about 3 orders of magnitude from 2000 to present days.
Another interesting phenomenon that can be appreciated in both
charts is the sudden contraction of contributions from North Amer-
ica in 1995; since the charts depict ratios, this corresponds to other
zones, and Europe in particular, increasing their share. An analysis
of the main contributions in the years right before the contraction
shows that nine out of ten have ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU as author
email domain, and the tenth is Keith Bostic, one of the leading Unix
BSD developers, appearing with email bostic. No developer with
the same email domain appears anymore within the first hundred
contributors in 1996. This shows the relevance that BSD Unix and
the Computer Systems Research Group at the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley had in the history of open source software. The
group was disbanded in 1995, partially as a consequence of the
so-called UNIX wars [12], and this contributes significantly—also
because of the relatively low amount of public code circulating at
the time—to the sudden drop of contributions from North America
in subsequent years. Descendant UNIX operating systems based on
BSD, such as OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and NetBSD had smaller relevance
to world trends due to (i) the increasing amount of open source
code coming from elsewhere and (ii) their more geographically
diverse developer community.

Another time frame in which the ratios for Europe and North
America are subject to large, sudden changes is 1975–79. A prelim-
inary analysis shows that these ratios are erratic due to the very
limited number of commits in those time period, but we were un-
able to detect a specific root cause. Trends for those years should be
subject to further studies, in collaboration with software historians.

Colonialism. Another trend that stands out from the charts is
that Africa appears to be well represented. To assess if this results
from a methodological bias, we double-checked the commits de-
tected as originating from Africa for timezones included in the
[0, 3] range using both the email- the offset/name-based methods.
The results show that the offset/name-based approach assigns 22.7%
of the commits to Africa whereas the email-based one only assigns
2.7% of them. While a deeper investigation is in order, it is our
opinion that the phenomenon we are witnessing here is a con-
sequence of colonialism, specifically the adoption of Europeans
names in African countries. For example the name Eric, derived
from Old Norse, is more popular in Ghana than it is in France or in

the UK. This challenges the ability of the offset/name-based method
to correctly differentiate between candidate places. Together with
the fact that several African countries are largely populated, the
offset/name-based method could detect European names as orig-
inating from Africa. While this cuts both way, the likelihood of
a random person contributing to public code is very different be-
tween European countries, all having a well-developed software
industry, and African countries that do not all share this trait.

Immigration/emigration. Another area where a similar phenome-
non could be at play is the evolution of Central and South America.
Contribution from this macro region appears to be growing steadily.
To assess if this is the result of a bias introduced by the name-based
detection we analyzed the evolution of offset/name-based assign-
ment over time for authors whose email domain is among the top-
ten US-based entities in terms of overall contributions (estimated in
turn by analyzing the most frequent email domains and manually
selecting those belonging to US-based entities). In 1971 no author
with an email from top US-based entities is detected as belonging
to Central and South America, whereas in 2019 the ratio is 12%.
Nowadays more than one tenth of the people email-associated to
top US-based entities have popular Central and South American
names, which we posit as a likely consequence of immigration into
US (emigration from Central and South America). Since immigra-
tion has a much longer history than what we are studying here,
what we are witnessing probably includes long-term consequences
of it, such as second and third generation immigrants employed in
white-collar jobs, such as software development.

5 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We have performed an exploratory, yet very large scale, empirical
study of the geographic diversity in public code commits over time.
We have analyzed 2.2 billion public commits covering the 1971–2021
time period. We have geolocated developers to 12 world regions
using as signals email domains, timezone offsets, and author names.
Our findings show that the geographic diversity in public code is
increasing over time, and markedly so over the past 20–25 years.
Observed trends also co-occur with historical events and macro
phenomena like the end of the UNIX wars, increase of coding
literacy around the world, colonialism, and immigration.

Limitations. This study relies on a combination of two geolo-
cation methods: one based on email domains, another based on
commit UTC offsets and author names. We discussed some of the
limitations of either method in Section 3, motivating our decision
of restricting the use of the email-based method to commits with a
zero UTC offset. As a consequence, for most commits in the dataset
the offset/name-based method is used. With such method, the fre-
quencies of forenames and surnames are used to rank candidate
zones that have a compatible UTC offset at commit time.

A practical consequence of this is that for commits with, say,
offset UTC+09:00 the candidate places can be Russia, Japan and
Australia, depending on the specific date due to daylight saving
time. Popular forenames and surnames in these regions tend to be
quite different so the likelihood of the method to provide a reliable
detection is high. For other offsets the set of popular forenames and
surnames from candidate zones can exhibit more substantial over-
laps, negatively impacting detection accuracy. We have discussed

some of these cases in Section 4, but other might be lingering in
the results impacting observed trends.

The choice of using the email-based method for commits with
zero UTC offset, and the offset/name-based method elsewhere, has
allowed us to study all developers not having a country-specific
email domain (ccTLD), but comes with the risk of under-representing
the world zones that have (in part and in some times of the year)
an actual UTC offset of zero.

A potential bias in this study could be introduced by the fact that
the name database used for offset/name-based geolocation only
contains names formed using Latin alphabet characters. We looked
for names containing Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters in
the original dataset, finding only a negligible amount of authors
who use non-Latin characters in their VCS names, which leads us
to believe that the impact of this issue is minimal.

We did not apply identity merging (e.g., using state-of-the-art
tools like SortingHat [15]), but we do not expect this to be a sig-
nificant issue because: (a) to introduce bias in author trends the
distribution of identity merges around the world should be un-
even, which seems unlikely; and (b) the observed commit trends
(which would be unaffected by identity merging) are very similar
to observed author trends.

We did not systematically remove known bot accounts [14] from
the author dataset, but we did check for the presence of software
bots among the top committers of each year. We only found lim-
ited traces of continuous integration (CI) bots, used primarily to
automate merge commits. After removing CI bots from the dataset
the observed global trends were unchanged, therefore this paper
presents unfiltered data.

Future work. To some extent the above limitations are the price
to pay to study such a large dataset: there exists a trade-off be-
tween large-scale analysis and accuracy. We plan nonetheless to
further investigate and mitigate them in future work. Multi-method
approaches, merging data mining with social science methods,
could be applied to address some of the questions raised in this
exploratory study. While they do not scale to the whole dataset,
multi-methods can be adopted to dig deeper into specific aspects,
specifically those related to social phenomena. Software is a so-
cial artifact, it is no wonder that aspects related to sociocultural
evolution emerge when analyzing its evolution at this scale.
