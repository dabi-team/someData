ABSTRACT
We present ClearBuds, the first hardware and software system
that utilizes a neural network to enhance speech streamed from
two wireless earbuds. Real-time speech enhancement for wireless
earbuds requires high-quality sound separation and background
cancellation, operating in real-time and on a mobile phone. Clear-
Buds bridges state-of-the-art deep learning for blind audio source
separation and in-ear mobile systems by making two key technical
contributions: 1) a new wireless earbud design capable of operating
as a synchronized, binaural microphone array, and 2) a lightweight
dual-channel speech enhancement neural network that runs on a
mobile device. Our neural network has a novel cascaded architec-
ture that combines a time-domain conventional neural network
with a spectrogram-based frequency masking neural network to
reduce the artifacts in the audio output. Results show that our
wireless earbuds achieve a synchronization error less than 64 𝜇s
and our network has a runtime of 21.4 ms on an accompanying
mobile phone. In-the-wild evaluation with eight users in previously
unseen indoor and outdoor multipath scenarios demonstrates that
our neural network generalizes to learn both spatial and acoustic
cues to perform noise suppression and background speech removal.
In a user-study with 37 participants who spent over 15.4 hours rat-
ing 1041 audio samples collected in-the-wild, our system achieves
improved mean opinion score and background noise suppression.

1 INTRODUCTION
With the rapid proliferation of wireless earbuds (100 million AirPods
sold in 2020 [1]), more people than ever are taking calls on-the-
go. While these systems offer unprecedented convenience, their
mobility raises an important technical challenge: environmental
noise (e.g., street sounds, people talking) can interfere and make
it harder to understand the speaker. We therefore seek to enhance
the speaker’s voice and suppress background sounds using speech
captured across the two earbuds.

Source separation of acoustic signals is a long-standing problem
where the conventional approach for decades has been to perform
beamforming using multiple microphones. Signal processing-based
beamformers that are computationally lightweight can encode the

spatial information but do not effectively capture acoustic cues [2–
4]. Recent work has shown that deep neural networks can encode
both spatial and acoustic information and hence can achieve supe-
rior source separation with gains of up to 9 dB over signal process-
ing baselines [5, 6]. However, these neural networks are computa-
tionally expensive. None of the existing binaural (i.e., using two
microphones) neural networks can meet the end-to-end latency
required for telephony applications or have been evaluated with
real earbud data. Commercial end-to-end systems, like Krisp [7],
use neural networks on a cloud server for single-channel speech
enhancement, with implications to cost and privacy.

We present the first mobile system that uses neural networks
to achieve real-time speech enhancement from binaural wireless
earbuds. Our key insight is to treat wireless earbuds as a binaural
microphone array, and exploit the specific geometry – two well-
separated microphones behind a proximal source – to devise a
specialized neural network for high quality speaker separation.
In contrast to using multiple microphones on the same earbud to
perform beamforming, as is common in Apple AirPods [8] and
other hearing aids, we use microphones across the left and right
earbuds, increasing the distance between the two microphones and
thus the spatial resolution.

To realize this vision, we need to address three key technical

challenges to deliver a functioning, practical system:

(1) Today’s wireless earbuds only support one channel of micro-
phone up-link to the phone. AirPods and similar devices up-
load microphone output from only a single earbud at a time.
To achieve binaural speaker separation, we need to design
and build novel earbud hardware that can synchronously
transmit audio data from both the earbuds, and maintain
tight synchronization over long periods of time.

(2) Binaural speech enhancement networks have high compu-
tational requirements, and have not been demonstrated on
mobile devices with data from wireless earbuds. Reducing
the network size naively often leads to unpleasant artifacts.
Thus, we also need to optimize the neural networks to run
in real-time on smart devices that have a limited computa-
tional capability compared to cloud GPUs. Further, we need
to meet the end-to-end latency requirements for telephony
applications and ensure that the resulting audio output has
a high quality from a user experience perspective.

(3) Prior binaural speech enhancement networks are trained and
tested on synthetic data and have not been shown to gener-
alize to real data. Building an end-to-end system however
requires a network that generalizes to in-the-wild use.
To achieve this system, we make three technical contributions

spanning earable hardware and neural networks.

Figure 3: Background voice performance. We use spatial
cues to separate background voices from the target speaker,
even when the background voice is louder than the target
voice. This is evident when the target speaker is silent but
background voice continues to talk (highlighted in orange).
Apple AirPods Pro uses an endfire beamformer to partially
suppress background voice. The mono-channel Facebook
Denoiser (Demucs) is unable to suppress the background
voice. Clearbud’s network removes the background voice,
approaching ground truth.

• Synchronized binaural earables. We designed a binaural wire-
less earbud system (Fig. 2) capable of streaming two time-synchronized
microphone audio streams to a mobile device. This is one of the
first systems of its kind, and we expect our open-source earbud
hardware and firmware to be of wider interest as a research and de-
velopment platform. Existing earable platforms such as eSense [9]
do not support time-synchronized audio transmission from two
earbuds to a mobile device. We designed our DIY hardware using
open source eCAD software, outsourced fabrication and assembly
($2K for 50 units), and 3D printed the enclosures.
• Lightweight cascaded neural network. We introduce a light-
weight neural network that utilizes binaural input from wearable
earbuds to isolate the target speaker. To achieve real-time opera-
tion, we start with the Conv-TasNet source separation network [6]
and redesign the network to achieve a 90% re-use of the computed
network activations from the previous time step for each new audio
segment (see §3.2). While these optimizations make this network
real-time, they also introduce artifacts in the audio output (i.e.,
crackling, static). Interestingly, these artifacts have little effect on
traditional metrics, like Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR), but have
a noticeable effect on subjective listening scores (see §5.2). These
artifacts however are often visible in a frequency representation of
the audio. To address this, we combine our mobile temporal model
with a real-time spectrogram-based frequency masking neural net-
work. We show that by combining the two networks and creating a
lightweight cascaded network, we can reduce artifacts and improve
the audio quality further.
• Network training for in-the-wild generalization. Training
the network in a supervised way requires clean ground truth speech
samples as training targets. This is difficult to obtain in fully natural
settings since the ground truth speech is corrupted with background
noise and voices. Training a network that generalizes to in-the-wild
scenarios also requires the training data to mimic the dynamics of
real speech as closely as possible. This includes reverb, voice res-
onance, and microphone response. Synthetically rendered spatial
data is the easiest type of data to obtain, but most different from real

recordings, while real speakers wearing the headset in an anechoic
chamber provide the best ground-truth training targets, but are the
most costly to obtain. Synthetic data can simulate various reverb
and multi-path that are not captured in an anechoic chamber. Our
training methodology uses large amounts of synthetic data simu-
lated in software, small amounts of hardware data with speakers
embedded into a foam mannequin head and small amounts of data
from human speakers wearing the earbuds in an anechoic chamber
(see §4) to create a neural network that generalizes to users and
multi-path environments not in the training data.

We combine our wireless earbuds and neural network to create
ClearBuds, an end-to-end system capable of (1) source separation
for the intended speaker in noisy environments, (2) attenuation
and/or elimination of both background noises and external human
voices, and (3) real-time, on-device processing on a commodity
mobile phone paired to the two earbuds. Our results show that:
• Our binaural wireless earbuds can stream audio to a phone with
a synchronization error less than 64𝜇s and operate continuously
on a coin cell battery for 40 hours.
• Our system outperforms Apple AirPods Pro by 5.23, 8.61, and
6.94 dB for the tasks of separating the target voice from background
noise, background voices, and a combination of background noise
and voices respectively.
• Our network has a runtime of 21.4ms on iPhone 12, and the entire
ClearBuds system operates in real-time with an end-to-end latency
of 109ms. For telephony applications, an ear-to-mouth latency of
less than 200ms is required for a good user experience [10].
• In-the-wild evaluation with eight users in various indoor and
outdoor scenarios shows that our system generalizes to previously
unseen participants and multipath environments, that are not in
the training data.
• In a user study with 37 participants who spent over 15.4 hours and
rated a total of 1041 in-the-wild audio samples, our cascaded net-
work achieved a higher mean opinion score and noise suppression
than both the input speech as well as a lightweight Conv-TasNet.

We believe that this paper bridges state-of-the-art deep learning
for blind audio source separation and in-ear mobile systems. The
ability to perform background noise suppression and speech separa-
tion could positively impact millions of people who use earbuds to
take calls on-the-go. By open-sourcing the hardware and collected
datasets, our work may help kickstart future research among mo-
bile system and machine learning researchers to design algorithms
around wireless earbud data.

2 RELATED WORK
Endfire beamforming configurations remain popular on consumer
mobile phones and earbuds [8, 11–13]. While recent advances in
neural networks have shown promising results, none of them are
demonstrated with wireless earbuds. By creating a wireless network
between two earbuds, we demonstrate that our real-time, two-
channel neural network can outperform current real-time speech
enhancement approaches for wireless earbuds.

Beamforming techniques. Since signal-processing based beamform-
ing is computationally lightweight, these techniques are deployed

on commercial devices such as smart speakers [14], mobile phones
[11], and earbud devices like Apple AirPods [8]. However, the per-
formance of beamforming is limited by the geometry of the micro-
phones and the distance between them [2, 15]. The form factor of
devices like AirPods restricts both the number of microphones on a
single earbud and the available distance between them, limiting the
gain of the beamformer. While beamforming across two earbuds
could provide better performance in principle, current wireless
architectures are limited to streaming from a single earbud at a
time [16]. Furthermore, adaptive beamformers such as MVDR [17],
while showing promise with relatively few interfering sources, are
sensitive to sensor placement tolerance and steering [18, 19]. Fi-
nally, beamforming leverages spatial or spectral cues only and does
not use acoustic cues (e.g., structure in human speech) and percep-
tual differences to discriminate sources, information that machine
learning methods leverage successfully.

Single-channel deep speech enhancement. Many deep learning tech-
niques operate on spectrograms to separate the human voice from
background noise [20–27]. However, recent works instead operate
directly on the time domain signals [6, 28–31], yielding perfor-
mance improvements over spectrogram approaches. Commercial
noise suppression software like Krisp [7] and Google Meet [32]
have successfully deployed single-channel models in real-time and
are available for use on mobile phones and desktop computers,
but processing is performed on the cloud. [33] achieves low-power
speech enhancement using long short-term memory (LSTM), but it
is for a single-channel network but not for multichannel source sep-
aration. Further, single-channel models cannot effectively capture
spatial information and fail to isolate the intended speaker when
there are multiple speakers (see Fig. 3).

Multi-channel source separation and speech enhancement. Multi-
channel methods have been shown to perform better than their
single-channel source separation counterparts [18, 34–38]. Binaural
methods have also been used for source separation [39–42] and
localization [43–45]; [40] reduces the look-ahead time in the net-
work to make it causal in behavior but has not been demonstrated
to run on a mobile device. Our method improves on existing bin-
aural methods by combining time-domain neural network with
spectrogram-based frequency masking networks as well as opti-
mizing them to enable real-time processing on a phone. Recent
works such as [46–48] use multiple microphones on a smartphone
for speech-enhancement. However, neither of them demonstrates
evaluation with real data, where artifacts because of network opti-
mizations can affect user performance. In contrast, we demonstrate
the first system that achieves real-time speech enhancement using
microphones on the two wireless earbuds. Further, as the distance
between the earbuds is larger than the distance between micro-
phones on a typical mobile phone, we can attain a better baseline
than a mobile phone implementation, while also retaining the abil-
ity to speak hands-free. More recent works tackle the problem
of real-time directional hearing using eye trackers and wearable
headsets. For example, [49] uses a hybrid network that combines
signal processing with neural networks, but shows that their tech-
nique performs poorly in binaural scenarios (i.e., two microphones)
and requires four or more microphones. In contrast, we focus on
the problem of speech enhancement and create the first real-time

end-to-end hardware-software neural-network based system using
wireless synchronized earbuds.

Earbud computing and platforms. There has been recent interest
in earbud computing [9, 50–53] to address applications in health
monitoring [54–56], activity tracking [57] and sensor fusion with
EEG signals [58]. The eSense platform [9, 51] has enabled research
in sensing applications with earables. OpenMHA [59, 60] is an open
signal processing software platform for hearing aid research. Neither
of these platforms support time-synchronized audio transmission
from two earbuds, which is a critical requirement for achieving
speech enhancement in binaural settings. In contrast, we created
open-source wireless earbud hardware that can support synchro-
nize wireless transmission from the two earbuds.

3 CLEARBUDS DESIGN
We first introduce our lightweight neural network architecture.
We then describe system design of our hardware platform and
our synchronization algorithm. We open-source our mechanical,
firmware, application, and network designs at our project website:
https://clearbuds.cs.washington.edu.

3.1 Problem Formulation
Suppose we have a 2 channel microphone array with one micro-
phone on each ear of the wearer. The target voice is speaking with
a signal 𝑠0 ∈ R2×𝑇 in the presence of some background noise bg
or other non-target speakers 𝑠1..𝑁 . There may also be multi-path
reflections and reverberations r which we would also like to reduce,
i.e., x = (cid:205)𝑁
𝑖=0 s𝑖 + bg + r. Our goal is then to recover the target
speaker’s signal, 𝑠0, while ignoring the background, reverbations, or
other speakers. We also must do so in a real-time way, meaning that
the a mixture sample x𝑡 received at time 𝑡 must be processed and
outputted by the network before 𝑡 + L for some defined latency L.
We refer to the non-target speakers as "background voices". These
background voices may be at any location in the scene, including
very close to the target speaker and their angle can change with
time and motion.

3.2 Neural Network Architecture Motivation
Our network needs to perform in real-time on a mobile device with
minimal latency. This is challenging for several reasons. First, the
processing device has a much lower compute capacity, especially

compared to cloud GPUs. Additionally, the network should sepa-
rate non-speech noises as well as unwanted speech. To do this, it
must learn spatial cues and human voice characteristics. Finally,
the resulting output should maximize the quality from a human
experience perspective while minimizing any artifacts the network
might introduce.

Our network, which we call ClearBuds-Net or CB-Net, is a cas-
caded model that operates in both time and frequency domains. The
full network architecture is illustrated in Fig. 4 and contains two
main sub-components: A dual-channel time domain network called
CB-Conv-TasNet, and a frequency based network called CB-UNet.

3.2.1 CB-Conv-TasNet. The first component of separation method
is a time domain network that is based on a multi-channel extension
of Conv-TasNet [6]. This is a network in the waveform domain that
has a Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) structure, lending itself
to a causal implementation with intermediate layer caching [61].
We use depthwise separable convolutions [62] to further reduce
the number of parameters and make the design real-time. We call
this network CB-Conv-TasNet since it is an optimized version of
the original Conv-TasNet.

A key feature of the time domain approach is that it can easily
capture spatial cues in the network. In our application, the desired
source is always physically between two microphones, thus the
voice signal will reach the microphones roughly at the same time. In
contrast, background or other speakers are typically not temporally
aligned and will reach one microphone earlier or later. By feeding
two time synchronized channels into the neural network, this spa-
tial alignment of the sources can be learned from time differences
in the signal. This is similar to a delay-and-sum beamforming effect,
except the sum is replaced with a deep network.

3.2.2 CB-UNet. The output of our lightweight CB-Conv-TasNet
often contains audible artifacts (i.e., crackling, static) that reduce
the listening experience. Interestingly, these artifacts have little
effect on traditional metrics, like Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR),
but have a noticeable effect on subjective listening scores (see §5.2).
These artifacts are often visible in a frequency representation of the
audio. Fig. 5 shows how CB-Conv-TasNet alone contains noticeable
artifacts when compared to the ground truth. To address this, we
cascade a lightweight causal UNet [63] which operates on the mel-
scale spectrogram of the input audio. This network, which we call
CB-UNet, produces a binary mask which is applied to the output of

Clearbuds: Wireless Binaural Earbuds for Learning-Based Speech Enhancement

Figure 5: The spectrograms above show the motivation behind a combined time and frequency domain method. The output
of the time-domain component, CB-Conv-TasNet, contains artifacts, particularly at high frequencies. Although subtle, these
artifacts are perceptible by human listeners. CB-Net is able to reduce these artifacts by using a frequency-domain network
(CB-UNet) that masks unwanted frequencies.
CB-Conv-TasNet. The combined output, shown in Fig. 5 as CB-Net,
reduces these artifacts. The mean opinion scores in our evaluation
shows the strength of the cascaded CB-Net when compared to the
time-domain component only.

3.3 Neural Network Detailed Description
3.3.1 CB-Conv-TasNet. The input to the network is a binaural mix-
ture given by x ∈ R2×𝑇 . The first step is an encoder that transforms
the mixture x into R𝑁 ×𝑇 /𝐿 with a 1D convolution of size 𝐿 and
stride 𝐿. This is followed by a ReLU layer. The encoder’s outputs
are next fed into a temporal convolution network that consists of
stacks of 1-D convolutions with increasing dilation factors. We use
14 convolution layers with dilation factors of 1,2,4,..,64 repeated
twice, with a ReLU nonlinearity and skip connection after each
convolution. The encoder output is multiplied with the output of
the temporal conv-net, before being fed through a fully connected
Decoder layer which transforms the output back into R2×𝑊 .

In a real-world implementation, we do not have access to the
full waveform, but only packets of data at a time. Furthermore,
we must process these packets with limited access to future input
samples. Given 15.625 kHz sampling rate, we choose to process
packets of 350 samples at a time (22.4ms), which is our window
size 𝑊 . We also use 2𝑊 , or 700 samples of lookahead time (44.8ms)
and 1.5s of past samples. Since we have no padding in the temporal
convolution net, the network starts with this large temporal context
and outputs exactly R1×𝑊 samples, corresponding to the desired
output for our input packet of 𝑊 samples. When we receive the
next packet of size 𝑊 , all intermediate activation from the encoder
and temporal conv-net can be shifted over by 𝑊 /𝐿 samples and re-
used. We chose 𝐿 = 50, but any divisor of 𝑊 would work. Re-using
intermediate outputs from previous packets saves over 90% of the
compute time for a new packet in our network.

3.3.2 CB-UNet. The frequency domain network is a mono-channel
network that outputs a binary mask for each time-frequency bin.
The input x ∈ R1×𝑇 is a summation of the binaural left and right
channel, which is the equivalent of a broadside beamformer. We

Figure 6: CB-Conv-TasNet, the time-domain component of
CB-Net. Given a packet of 350 samples (22.4ms) highlighted
in blue, we use 1.5s of past input and 44.8ms of future input
to output the separation results. Our caching scheme works
as follows: When we receive a new 350ms samples, all inter-
mediate activations (circles in the diagram) slide to the left,
and we compute only the rightmost column of outputs.

first run a STFT, which is a mel-scale fourier transform with hop
size of 350, a window size of 1024 including zero padding on the
edges, and a 128 bin mel-scale output. The network input is a spec-
trogram of 64 time bins and 128 frequency bins, corresponding to a
receptive field of 22400 samples, or 1.43𝑠. In order to maintain the
causality requirement, we use the same lookahead strategy as the
time-domain network where we allow 700 samples of lookahead
for a target packet of 350 samples. The UNet architecture contains
4 downsampling and upsampling layers, starting with 64 channels
and doubling the number of channels at each subsequent layer. The
downsampling layers contain a depthwise separable convolution
followed by a 2 × 2 max pooling, and the upsampling layers contain
a depthwise separable convolution followed by a transposed con-
volution for upsampling. The output is a sigmoid function, which
is then thresholded to return a binary mask in [0, 1]128×64. When
outputting a spectrogram mask on an R128×64 input, we predict a
mask over the entire input even though we only need the output

MobiSys ’22, June 25–July 1, 2022, Portland, OR, USA

Chatterjee, Kim, Jayaram, et al.

for a specific slice of 350 samples, or a R128×1 mask. Further opti-
mizations could be made by caching intermediate outputs or only
computing the mask for the target samples. However CB-UNet’s
run-time was so small compared to the rest of the network that
these optimizations were not necessary.

3.3.3 Combining the Outputs. At each time step, the output of CB-
Conv-Tasnet is an audio waveform in 𝑥 ∈ R1×350, and the output of
CB-UNet is a spectrogram mask in M ∈ R128×64. We run the same
fourier transform on the buffered conv-tasnet outputs to produce a
spectrogram X ∈ R128×64. Our output can then be computed by
𝑖𝑆𝑇 𝐹𝑇 (M ⊗ X). Our empirical results show that this gives the best
results compared to other methods such as ratio masking.

3.3.4 Training. CB-Conv-TasNet is trained with an 𝐿1-based loss
over the waveform along with the multi-resolution spectrogram
loss. Formally, provided 𝑠0 is our target speaker and 𝑥 ′ is the output
from the network, our loss is:
(cid:13)𝑠0 − 𝑥 ′(cid:13)
𝐿(𝑠0, 𝑥 ′) = (cid:13)

(cid:13)1 + 𝐿𝑠𝑐 (𝑠0, 𝑥 ′) + 𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑔 (𝑠0, 𝑥 ′)
∥𝑆𝑇 𝐹𝑇 (𝑠0) − 𝑆𝑇 𝐹𝑇 (𝑥 ′)∥𝐹
∥𝑆𝑇 𝐹𝑇 (𝑠0)∥𝐹
(cid:13)log(𝑆𝑇 𝐹𝑇 (𝑠0) − log(𝑆𝑇 𝐹𝑇 (𝑥 ′))(cid:13)
(cid:13)1

𝐿𝑠𝑐 (𝑠0, 𝑥 ′) =

𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑔 (𝑠0, 𝑥 ′) = (cid:13)

STFT denotes the magnitude of the short time Fourier transform,
and 𝐹 denotes the Frobenius norm. 𝐿𝑠𝑐 and 𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑔 represent spectral
convergence and magnitude losses, which gave better results than
L1 loss alone.

For training CB-UNet, for each time frequency bin, the training
target M is 1 if the target voice is the dominant component, and 0
otherwise. Formally, M(𝑓 , 𝑡) = [S0 (𝑓 , 𝑡) ≥ S𝑖 (𝑓 , 𝑡)], ∀𝑖 = (1..𝑛).
The network is then trained with the binary cross entropy of the
output compared to the target mask.

3.3.5 Hyperparameters and Training Details. We use a learning
rate of 3 × 10−4 along with the ADAM optimizer [64] for training
the network. The network was trained on a single Nvidia TITAN
Xp GPU. Because of the small size of the network, training could be
completed within a single day and generally required ≈50 epochs
to reach convergence.As an additional data augmentation step we
make the following perturbations to the data: High-shelf and low-
shelf gain of up to 2 𝑑𝐵 are randomly added using the sox library.

3.4 Synchronized wireless earbuds
We seek to capture speech from the target speaker’s mouth which
sits on the sagittal plane roughly equidistant to the ears. Given an
ear-to-ear spacing of 17.5cm, to effectively isolate this central plane
we require a distance precision on the order of a few centimeters.
An interaural time difference of 100𝜇s would correspond to source
maximally 3.43 cm off this central plane, therefore we target a
synchronization accuracy under 100𝜇s.

3.4.1 Hardware. Our custom hardware design contains a pulse-
density modulated (PDM) microphone (Invensense ICS-41350) and
a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) microcontroller (Nordic nRF52840).1

1For future research applications, an ultra low-power accelerometer (Bosch BMA400),
a 1Gbit NAND flash for local data collection (Winbond W25N01GVZEIG), and support
for speaker and an additional microphone are included.

Figure 7: Hardware Block Diagram. Each ClearBud inte-
grates a PDM microphone, accelerometer, flash, and coin
cell battery. Buttons and LEDs are used for interfacing with
the device, and a USB port is used for programming and de-
bug.

The system is powered off of a CR2032 coin cell battery and pro-
grammed via SWD over a Micro-USB connector. Each ClearBud has
an integrated PDM microphone set to a clock frequency of 2MHz.
With an internal PDM decimation ratio of 64, this provides us a
sampling frequency of 31.25kHz. As most HD voice applications
and wideband codecs are limited to 16kHz [65], we decimate further
in firmware by a factor of 2, giving us a final sampling frequency
of 15.625kHz.

are round-robined: one is filled with incoming PCM data while the
other is processed. The DMA is responsible for both clocking in
the PDM data and converting it into PCM. One buffer is always
connected to the DMA, while the other is freed for processing for the
rest of the data pipeline. When the buffer connected to the DMA fills,
the buffers switch roles and we begin processing data on the newly
freed buffer, and connect the other buffer back to the DMA. With
this design we always have a continuous PCM stream to operate
on. Both ClearBuds transmit the PCM microphone data to a mobile
phone for input into our neural network. To maximize throughput,
we use the highest Bluetooth rate and packet sizes supported by iOS,
which is 2Mbps and 182 bytes, respectively. We design a lightweight
wireless protocol where the first 2 bytes represent a monotonically-
increasing sequence number, while the other 180 bytes are reserved
for the 16-bit PCM audio samples. The sequence number is used
on the phone so that we can zero-pad PCM data in the occasional
event that a packet is dropped either over-the-air or by the radio
hardware. This zero-padding keeps the left and right microphone
data aligned on the host side in areas of poor radio performance or
interference in the environment.

The hardware schematic and layout for ClearBuds was designed
using the open source eCAD tool KiCad. A 2-layer flexible printed
circuit was fabricated and assembled by PCBWay. The 3D printed
enclosures were designed using AutoDesk Fusion 360 and printed
with a Phrozen Sonic Mini using a liquid resin fabrication process.
The MEMS microphone sits behind the lid on the earbud’s outer
surface. A single button on the enclosure provides access to turn
on and off the earbuds.

Figure 8: Time Sync Design. The primary ClearBud broadcasts a sync clock over the air. The secondary ClearBud then uses
the sync clock to rate encode, by increasing or decreasing the size of its local PCM buffer.

3.4.2 Microphone synchronization. Three components are neces-
sary for maintaining microphone synchronization: (1) As each of
our earbuds has its own local clock source, we need to establish a
common clock between them so that they have the same reference
of time, (2) a synchronized startup so each earbud starts recording
from their respective microphone at the exact same time, and (3)
a rate encoding scheme to control the earbud’s sampling rate to
match each other.

In our system, each earbud has its own respective 32MHz clock
source with a total +/- 20ppm frequency tolerance budget. So, in
the worst case scenario, the earbuds will have 2.4 milliseconds of
drift each minute. We use the Nordic’s TimeSlot API [66], which
grants us access to the underlying radio hardware in between Blue-
tooth transmissions. This provides us a transport to transmit and
receive accurate time sync beacons [67]. Each ClearBud keeps a
free-running 16MHz hardware timer with a max value of 800,000,
overflowing and wrapping around at a rate of about 20 Hz. One
ClearBud is assigned as the timing master while the other ClearBud
will synchronize its free-running timer to the master’s. The primary
ClearBud (timing master) transmits time sync packets at a rate of
200 Hz. These packets contain the value of the free-running timer
at the time of the radio packet transmission. When the secondary
ClearBud receives this packet, it can then add or subtract an offset
to its own free-running timer for a common clock.

Once each ClearBud is connected to the mobile phone, the phone
sends a START command to both ClearBuds over BLE. Each Clear-
Bud contains firmware which arms a programmable peripheral
interconnect (PPI) to launch the PDM bus once the 16MHz free-
running timer wraps around at 800,000. By using this method, we
bypass the CPU and trigger a synchronized startup entirely at the
hardware layer. One caveat is that the mobile phone could write to
one ClearBud right before its clock wraps around at 800,000, and
the other ClearBud right after it wraps around at 800,000. With a
clock that wraps around at 20Hz, this would trigger a mismatched
startup and cause an alignment error of 50ms. To correct for this,
each ClearBud reports its common clock timer value to the phone
once it has received the START command. The phone can then re-
move the first 781 audio samples (781 samples / 15.625kHz = 50ms)
if one ClearBud started streaming 50ms before the other.

The final component to keeping the audio streams aligned is to
create a rate encoding scheme between the ClearBuds. With the
time sync beacons from the primary ClearBud, the other ClearBud

now has both its local clock and the common clock (primary Clear-
Bud’s local clock). With these two clocks, the secondary ClearBud
can identify how much faster or slower its PDM clock is running
in relation to the primary ClearBud. We note that with a 2MHz
PDM clock and a PDM decimation ratio of 64, each audio sample
occupies 32 us. The non-primary ClearBud can then add or remove
a sample to its PDM buffer every time the difference between the
clocks exceeds a multiple of 32 us. By doing this, the secondary
ClearBud ensures that its PDM buffer starts filling up at the exact
same time as the primary ClearBud’s PDM buffer, with a tolerance
of 32 us.

4 TRAINING METHODOLOGY
Training the network in a supervised way requires clean ground
truth speech samples as training targets. This is difficult to obtain
in fully natural settings since the ground truth speech is corrupted
with background noise and voices. Training a network that gen-
eralizes to in-the-wild scenarios also requires the training data
to mimic the dynamics of real speech as closely as possible. This
includes reverb, voice resonance, and microphone response. Syn-
thetically rendered spatial data is the easiest type of data to obtain,
but most different from real recordings, while real speakers wearing
the headset in an anechoic chamber provide the best ground-truth
training targets, but are the most costly to obtain. Synthetic data
can simulate various reverb and multipath that are not captured
in an anechoic chamber. We adopt a hybrid training methodology
where we first train on a large amount of synthetic data and fine-
tune on real data recorded with our hardware. Our training method
is based on the commonly used mix-and-separate framework [68],
where clean speech and noise samples are recorded separately and
combined randomly to form noisy mixtures. Our results show that
our network trained this way generalizes to naturally recorded
noisy data in real-world environments.

Synthetic data. This type of data is the easiest to obtain, since
a wide variety of voice types and physical setups can be generated
instantly. Many machine learning baselines, e.g., [37, 38, 69], only
train and evaluate on synthetic data generated in this manner. To
generate the synthetic dataset, we create multi-speaker recordings
in simulated environments with reverb and background noises. All
voices come from the VCTK dataset [70] (110 unique speakers with
over 44 hours), and background sounds come from the WHAM!
dataset [71], with 58 hours of recordings from a variety of noise
environments such as a restaurant, crowd, and music.

MobiSys ’22, June 25–July 1, 2022, Portland, OR, USA

Chatterjee, Kim, Jayaram, et al.

To synthesize a single example, we create a 3 second mixture as
follows: two virtual microphones are placed 17.5 cm apart, which is
the average distance between human ears [72]. The target speaker’s
voice is placed at the center between the two virtual microphones,
and a second voice is placed randomly between 1 and 5 meters away
and at a random angle. A randomly chosen background noise is
also placed in the scene. We then simulate room impulse responses
(RIRs) for a randomly sized room using the image source method
implemented in the pyroomacoustics library [73, 74]. The room
is rectangular with sides randomly chosen between 5 and 20 me-
ters, and the RT60 values are randomly chosen between 0 and 1
second. All signals are convolved with the RIR and rendered to the
two channel microphone array. The volumes of the background
are randomly chosen so that the input signal-to-distortion ratio is
roughly between -5 and 5 dB. For training, we use 10,000 mixtures
generated in this manner.

Hardware data. While a large amount of synthetic data can
be easily rendered to train the network, it does not contain char-
acteristics such as the microphone response of physical hardware
and imperfections in the time-of-arrival. To address this, we also
train on a set of recorded voice samples from our earbuds. We set
up a foam mannequin head with an artificial mouth speaker (Sony
SBS-XB12) that plays VCTK samples as the spoken ground truth.
For background voice recordings, the speaker is placed in varying
locations within a one meter radius of the foam head. Physically
recorded background noise is provided by binaural version of the
WHAM! dataset [71], which was recorded in real environments
using a binaural mannequin like ours. We record 2 hours each of
clean speech, and background voices. 2000 random mixtures are
then created for training.

Human data. The spoken hardware data above still does not
contain natural voice resonance since it is played out of an elec-
tronic speaker. Furthermore, the background sounds recorded by
a mannequin wearing earbuds still misses some of the physical
filtering of the human body. To better capture desired output of real
scenarios, we collect a ground-truth speech dataset in an anechoic
chamber with human speakers (5 male, 4 female) and a noise dataset
in real environments with human listeners. For the voice data, each
human speaker wore our ClearBuds prototypes, and uttered 15 min-
utes of text from Project Gutenberg in the anechoic chamber. The
purpose of this anechoic data is to provide clean training targets for
the network, modelling the resonance of human speakers wearing
our hardware. For the real world noise dataset, individuals wore
ClearBuds and recorded various noisy scenarios such as washing
dishes, loud indoor/outdoor restaurants, and busy traffic intersec-
tions. 2000 random mixtures of clean voice and recorded noise were
generated for this dataset.

Our network is jointly trained using all these datasets. Note that

testing and evaluation is done outside the anechoic chamber.

5 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
We first compare our end-to-end system performance against a com-
mercial wireless earbud system. We then present in-the-wild evalu-
ation of our system. Next, we compare numerical results against
various speech enhancement baselines. Finally, we present system-
level evaluations. Our work is approved by the IRB.

put SI-SDR (note: not SI-SDR increase). ClearBuds exceeds
in three conditions: target voice plus background noise (BG),
target voice plus background voice (BV), target voice plus
background voice and noise.

5.1 Comparison with Beamforming Earbuds
We evaluate our end-to-end system against the Apple AirPods Pro
headset connected to a iPhone 12 Pro in a repeatable physical set
up. In our evaluation, as is typical, there is no overlap between
training and test datasets.

Procedure. We use the popular metric scale-invariant signal-
to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) [75]. While SI-SDR provides a repeat-
able metric used in the acoustic community, it requires a clean,
sample-aligned ground truth (target voice) as the basis for evalu-
ation. Therefore, we create a repeatable soundscape for our test
setup where a sample-aligned ground truth can be obtained. A foam
mannequin head with a speaker (Sony SBS-XB12) inserted into its
artificial mouth uttered one hundred VCTK samples with identi-
ties and samples unseen in the training set. The mannequin wore
ClearBuds and AirPods Pro in subsequent experiments, and the
outputs of the two systems could be directly compared. Ambient
environmental sound (from WHAM! dataset) was played via four
monitors (PreSonus Eris E3.5) positioned to fill 3 meter by 4 meter
room, and background voice (also VCTK) was played from a moni-
tor positioned 0.4 meters from head on the right. All speakers were
driven through a common USB interface (PreSonus 1810c) ensuring
the same time-alignment and loudness between the two test con-
ditions. Since Apple AirPods Pro beamforming cannot be toggled
on and off, we cannot calculate an SI-SDR increase (SI-SDRi), and
therefore report output SI-SDR. To establish the ground truth voice
against which to calculate SI-SDR, we record clean target voice
through each headset. Ambient noise SNR ranged between 0dB
and 16dB with respect to target voice. Qualitatively, this sounded
like a second person speaking loudly in a noisy bar or cafe. Finally,
background voice SNR ranged between 6dB and 12dB, qualitatively
sounding like a person speaking from a meter or two away.

Results. We report output SI-SDR from the two systems in Fig. 9.
To calculate output SI-SDR, we align individual one second chunks
and take the logarithmic mean across 250 chunks. We find that
ClearBuds achieves higher output SI-SDR across all test conditions
when compared to the beamforming utilized by the Apple AirPods
Pro. For a qualitative comparison of AirPods Pro versus ClearBuds
performance with human speakers, see video: https://clearbuds.cs.

5.2 In-the-Wild Evaluation
We perform in-the-wild evaluation in indoor and outdoor scenarios
as well as users not in the training data. The procedure and results
are described in the following sections.

In-the-wild experiments. Eight individuals (four male, four
female, mean age 25) with a variety of accents wore a pair of Clear-
Buds and read excerpts from Project Gutenberg [76] while in four
noisy environments: a coffee shop, a noisy intersection, an outdoor
plaza, and a classroom (see Fig. 10). The environments featured
ringing phones, cross-talk from other people, ambient music, a
crying baby, opening/closing doors, driving vehicles, and street
noise, amongst other common sounds. These experiments were un-
controlled in that the background voices and noise were naturally
occurring sounds that are typical to these real-world scenarios and
were mobile.

Evaluation procedure. In-the-wild evaluation precludes access
to clean, sample-aligned truth to compute SI-SDR. Instead, the
common (and expensive) procedure is to perform a user study and
compute the mean opinion score. Since this is a time-consuming
process, prior works on binaural networks, e.g., [38, 46, 69], avoid
in-the-wild evaluation. Since our goal is to design and evaluate an
in-ear system in real scenarios, we recruit thirty-seven participants
(11 female, 26 male, mean age 29) for a user study. Each participant
listened to between 6 and 11 in-the-wild audio samples (avg. 9.38
samples, each between 10–60 seconds). Each speech sample was
processed and presented three ways: (1) the original input, (2) CB-
Conv-TasNet, and (3) CB-Net, yielding a total of 37×9.38×3 = 1,041
rating samples.

Participants were encouraged to use audio equipment they would
typically use for a call. Fourteen used earbuds, thirteen used com-
puter speakers, seven used headphones, and three used phone speak-
ers. The study took about 25 minutes per participant. As is typical
with noise suppression systems, participants were asked to give
ratings in two categories: the intrusiveness of the noise and overall
quality (mean opinion score - MOS):

(1) Noise suppression: How INTRUSIVE/NOTICEABLE were the BACK-
GROUND sounds? 1 - Very intrusive, 2 - Somewhat intrusive, 3 - No-
ticeable, but not intrusive, 4 - Slightly noticeable, 5 - Not noticeable
(2) Overall MOS: If this were a phone call with another person, How was
your OVERALL experience? 1 - Bad, 2 - Poor, 3 - Fair, 4 - Good, 5 -
Excellent

Results. Fig. 11 shows the noise intrusiveness and MOS values
for the original microphone, CB-Conv-TasNet, and CB-Net. As
expected, applying CB-Conv-TasNet to the original audio helped
suppress noise dramatically, increasing opinion score from 2.02
(slight better than 2 - Somewhat intrusive) to 3.28 (between 3 -
Noticeable, but not intrusive and 4 - Slightly noticeable) (p<0.01).
The light-touch, spectrogram-masking clean up method featured
in CB-Net increased noise suppression opinion score significantly
(p<0.001) to 3.77, indicating the method did indeed further suppress
perceptually annoying noise artifacts. Importantly, this step also
increased overall MOS. While users only slightly preferred (p<0.05)
CB-Conv-TasNet (2.67) to the original input (2.49) due to artifacts
introduced, they more significantly (p<0.001) preferred our CB-
Net (3.10), an increase of 0.61 opinion score points from the input.

Challenge [77], with state-of-the-art, real-time algorithms run on a

suppression system, can be found linked from our project website:
https://clearbuds.cs.washington.edu.

Note that in our in-the-wild experiments, the background noise
and voices were not static. The speakers themselves can also be
mobile (see Fig. 12). Our network was able to adaptively remove the
background noise and achieve speech enhancement with mobility.

5.3 Benchmarking our Neural Network
The conventional evaluation in the machine learning and acous-
tic community is to evaluate models and techniques on synthetic
data against baselines. For completeness, we compare our method
against a variety of speech enhancement baselines using the syn-
thetic dataset. For evaluation, an additional 1000 mixtures of 3
seconds each were generated such that there was no overlapping
identities or samples between the train and test splits.

Evaluation Procedure. For comparisons to other baseline meth-
ods, we use the popular SI-SDR and PESQ metrics. Unlike the Air-
Pods experiment, where the original noisy mixture could not be
recorded since AirPods beamforming cannot be toggled off, here
we compute SI-SDR of the ground truth relative to both the input
noisy mixture and then to the network output. When reporting
the increase from the input SI-SDR to output SI-SDR, we use the
SI-SDR improvement (SI-SDRi).

For a deep learning baseline in the waveform domain, we choose
the causal Demucs model [30]. This is a single channel method
which was recently shown to outperform many other deep learning
baselines and runs real-time on a laptop CPU. We also compare
with Dual-signal Transformation LSTM Network (DTLN) [79]. This
method also runs on a laptop or mobile phone in real-time. To com-
pare with spectrogram based methods, we use the oracle baselines,
ideal ratio mask (IRM) and ideal binary mask (IBM) [80, 81], that
use the ground truth voice to calculate the best possible result that
can be obtained by masking a noisy spectrogram.

As an ablation study, we report results with each individual
component of the network, CB-Conv-TasNet and CB-UNet. We also
show results when the multi-channel part of our network, CB-Conv-
TasNet, only has access to one microphone, labeled as CB-Conv-
TasNet Single Mic. This explicitly shows the advantage of using
two microphones. There are only a few deep learning methods that
tackle binaural speech separation for mobile processing, and the
most relevant ones, such as [46] and [40], do not have publicly
available code to test against.

Results. As shown in Table 1, our binaural method is compara-
ble to the best possible results that can be obtained by a spectrogram
masking method (IBM, IRM). We also show an improvement over
waveform based deep learning methods that only use a single mi-
crophone input. In particular, the improvement is greatest when
there are two speakers present (Target Voice + Background Voice).
This is because single channel methods can only rely on voice char-
acteristics, whereas our network also uses spatial cues to separate
the speaker of interest. Although CB-Net shows similar or worse
performance to CB-Conv-TasNet, subjective evaluation on in-the-
wild hardware data shows that CB-Net is far superior to human
listeners (see §5.2).

5.3.1 Additional neural network evaluations. We numerically eval-
uate various aspects of the design by changing the angle of back-
ground voice, reverberance in the environment, and microphone
separation.

Angle of background voice. The ability of our network to
separate the target voice from a background voice is based on
utilizing the time difference of arrival to the binaural microphones.
Because we only have two microphones, this ability is limited when
the background voice is in the front-back plane of the speaker. In
this case, the background voice will arrive at each microphone
simultaneously, and there will be no spatial cues to separate the two
voices. To illustrate this effect, we graph the separation performance
as a function of the angle of the background voice in Fig. 13(a).

Multipath and reverberant environments. While our in-the-
wild experiments show the performance in various indoor and
outdoor environments, we benchmark our system in different re-
verberant conditions, including those more reverberant than seen
during training. Synthetically generated mixtures are generated
using the pyroomacoustics library with the RT60 value randomly
chosen between 0 and 4s. We generate 200 examples and plot the
SI-SDRi compared to the RT60 in Fig. 13(b). Our method shows
only a slight decrease in performance as the reverberation of the
environment increases. Because the target speaker is physically
close to the microphone array, our setup is generally less affected
by reverberations than other kinds of source separation problems
where the target speaker may be further away.

Separation between microphones. Our in-the-wild evalua-
tion across 8 participants showed generalization across facial fea-
tures. Here, we benchmark our method to different head sizes where
the distance between the microphones may be different. We gen-
erate 200 synthetic samples, where the distance between the mi-
crophones is randomly chosen between 10 and 25 cm. Because the
target speaker is in the middle of the microphone array, the target
signal will arrive at both mics simultaneously regardless of the
microphone distance. Fig. 13(c) show little change in performance
even with microphone distances greatly different than used during
training.

5.4 System Evaluation
Synchronization. In order to evaluate this, we place both Clear-
Buds roughly equidistant from a speaker. A click tone is played
every 15 seconds for 5 minutes, and recorded on both ClearBuds
with time sync disabled and enabled. We calculate the sample error
on each recorded click offline and convert it into time error with
a sampling rate of 15.625kHz. Fig. 14(a) shows the synchroniza-
tion results across a five minute interval. With time sync enabled,
the sample error never exceeds 1 sample at 15,625 kHz, or 64 𝜇s.
Fig. 14(b) also shows the CDF of the timing error across experiments
of 5 minutes each conducted with other Bluetooth devices in the
environment, with and without time synchronization.

ground noise (BG), (2) Background voice (BV), and (3) Background noise and background voice (BG and BV). CB-Conv-TasNet
performs slightly better on synthetic data, but as shown in Fig. 11, does not generalize as well to in-the-wild scenarios. This
demonstrates the importance of evaluating networks on real in-the-wild hardware data.

100 ms of network delay to move an IP packet from the source to
the destination.

With a 180-sample PCM buffer being filled at 31.25 kHz, there is
a 5.76 ms delay prior to the samples reaching BLE stack. Once these
samples reach the radio hardware, there is a worst-case additional
latency of 7.5 ms as defined by the minimum BLE connection in-
terval supported by Bluetooth 5.0 [82]. At the time of writing, the
latest iOS supports a minimum BLE connection interval of 15 ms.
After the samples reach the mobile phone, we wait for 67.2 ms to
receive enough samples to run a forward pass of our network. Our
network has a run-time of 21.4 ms on an iPhone 12 Pro (see Table 2).
The number of FLOPs is computed over each packet of 350 samples.
Together, we have a latency of 109 ms, leaving 91 ms for one-way
network delay (RTT=182ms).

Power analysis. CB-Net uses an order of magnitude lower
FLOPs per second compared to Conv-TasNet on the smartphone,
significantly reducing the computational and corresponding power
consumption. We also measure the power consumption of the
ClearBuds hardware. We measure current consumption by pow-
ering our system through its Micro-USB port with a DC power
supply set to 3V, which goes through the same power path as our
coin cell battery. While continuously wirelessly streaming micro-
phone data, we measure average current consumed to be 5 mA.
With the CR2032’s nominal capacity of 210 mAh, this translates to
approximately 42 hours of operation. Table 3 shows a breakdown

synchronization (red), microphone samples drift apart and
lose alignment at about 128𝜇s/min.

and reach the listener’s ear on the other end of the call. The Interna-
tional Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardiza-
tion Sector (ITU-T) G.114 recommendation regarding mouth-to-ear
delay indicates that most users are “very satisfied” as long as the
latency does not exceed 200 ms [10]. In our end-to-end system, we
targeted a one-way latency of 100 ms prior to uplink, leaving up to

6 LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK
The first limitation is that the user must be wearing both wireless
earbuds to benefit from our binaural noise suppression network.
Second, with only two microphones, there is an opportunity for
background voices to remain in the uplink channel if the voice
is within a few degrees of the target speaker’s sagittal plane (see
Fig. 13(a)). The underlying assumption of our network is that the
mouth is in the middle of the user’s ears, though as seen in Fig.
13(c) and our in-the-wild evaluation, some variance is permissible.
While we minimize the power consumption of the ClearBud hard-
ware, we shift the processing and therefore power consumption to
the more powerful mobile phone. Performing network computa-
tion on the mobile phone over a cloud GPU is an enhancement in
terms of user privacy and security so that sensitive voice data is not
transmitted to the cloud. While mobile chips are becoming more
power efficient, an alternative design to explore is to run our neu-
ral network on a plugged-in edge device (e.g., router), minimizing
computation while achieving similar latency.

Future work could integrate two microphones in each earbud,
so that each earbud could beamform toward the user’s mouth prior
to processing in the neural network. We also had to develop a
custom wireless audio protocol to stream two microphones to a
single phone. While this prevents this architecture from being
deployed on today’s commodity wireless earbuds, adoption may be
imminent as Bluetooth 5.2 shows promise with the introduction of
Multi-Stream Audio and Audio Broadcast [83].

Our network could also be deployed on other multi-microphone
mobile or resource-constrained edge systems such as smart watches,
augmented reality glasses, or smart speakers to allow for enhanced
voice control or telephony in noisy environments. The hardware
and firmware for Clearbuds could be leverage to produce wireless,
synchronized microphone arrays for telephony, acoustic activity
recognition or for swarm robot localization and control.

7 CONCLUSION
Real-time speech enhancement has been an open research challenge
for multiple decades. The recent proliferation of wireless earbuds
and neural network architectures provides an opportunity to build
systems that bridge neural networks and wireless earbuds to cre-
ate new capabilities. Here, we present ClearBuds, the first deep
learning based system to achieve real-time speech enhancement
with binaural wireless earbuds. At its core is a new open-source
wireless earbud design capable of operating as a synchronized bin-
aural microphone array and a lightweight cascaded neural network.

Component

BLE SoC (nRF52840)

In-the-wild experiments show that ClearBuds can achieve back-
ground noise suppression, background speech removal, and speaker
separation using wireless earbuds.
