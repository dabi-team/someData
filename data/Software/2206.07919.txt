Abstract 

Cross‐project defect prediction (CPDP), where data from 
different software projects are used to predict defects, has 
been  proposed  as  a  way  to  provide  data  for  software 
projects  that  lack  historical  data.  Evaluations  of  CPDP 
models using the Nearest Neighbour (NN) Filter approach 
have  shown  promising  results  in  recent  studies.  A  key 
challenge  with  defect‐prediction  datasets 
is  class 
imbalance,  that  is,  highly  skewed  datasets  where  non‐ 
buggy modules dominate the buggy modules. In the past, 
data resampling approaches have been applied to within‐
projects  defect  prediction  models  to  help  alleviate  the 
negative  effects  of  class  imbalance  in  the  datasets.  To 
address  the  class  imbalance  issue  in  CPDP,  the  authors 
assess the impact of data resampling approaches on CPDP 
models  after  the  NN  Filter  is  applied.  The  impact  on 
prediction  performance  of  five  oversampling  approaches 
(MAHAKIL,  SMOTE,  Borderline‐SMOTE,  Random 
Oversampling  and  ADASYN)  and  three  undersampling 
approaches  (Random  Undersampling,  Tomek  Links  and 
One‐sided  selection)  is  investigated  and  results  are 
compared  to  approaches  without  data  resampling.  The 
authors  examined  six  defect  prediction  models  on  34 
datasets  extracted  from  the  PROMISE  repository.  The 
authors'  results  show  that  there  is  a  significant  positive 
effect  of  data  resampling  on  CPDP  performance, 
suggesting  that  software  quality  teams  and  researchers 
should consider applying data resampling approaches for 
improved 
(𝑝𝑑)  and  g‐measure  prediction 
performance. However, if the goal is to improve precision 
and  reduce  false  alarm  (𝑝𝑓)  then  data  resampling 
approaches should be avoided.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Defect  prediction  models  can  help  to  identify  defective 
software  components  and  thereby  support  managers  in 
resource  allocation.  Previous  studies  have  shown  that 
defect prediction models can yield useful results [1, 2], but 

their  reliability  might  be  affected  by  the  quality  of  the 
underlying datasets [3] or confounding variables affecting 
the measures used for creating the prediction models [4, 5, 
6]. Several studies have proposed prediction models based 
on different statistical and machine‐learning approaches [7, 
8, 9]. However, the performance on these models largely 
depends on historical data, obtained either from the same 
project (in case historical data exist) or from projects that 
are  very  similar  to  the  project  under  consideration 
regarding content and context.  

Zimmermann  et  al.  [10]  cautioned  that  defect  prediction 
models perform well within projects as long as enough data 
for  training  of  the  prediction  models  exist.  However,  for 
new  and  unfamiliar  projects,  the  lack  of  historical  data 
becomes a challenge. A promising approach to handle this 
issue  is  to  use  a  cross‐company  or  cross‐project  defect 
prediction  (CPDP),  where  data  from  other  companies  or 
projects are used for model training. To help in obtaining 
the  most  suitable  training  data  for  CPDP,  different 
techniques  have  been  proposed  and  validated,  including 
data filtering techniques such as Nearest Neighbour (NN) 
filter [11], Double Transfer Boosting [12], and clustering 
[13, 14].  

NN  filter,  a  data  filtering  approach,  has  been  shown  to 
perform  significantly  better 
than  several  ensemble, 
boosting  or 
transfer‐learning‐based  approaches  [15]. 
Hosseini et al. [16] and Turhan et al. [17] confirmed that 
the NN filter can have a positive impact on the performance 
of  CPDP  models.  NN  filter  eliminates  irrelevant  data 
instances  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  target 
distribution, selecting only the more suitable defective and 
clean instances [11].  

However,  class  imbalance  is  a  prevalent  problem  in  data 
mining and defect prediction [18, 19], where the majority 
of  the  instances  are  clean  or  not  faulty  [19,  20]. 
Consequently, the acquired dataset for cross‐project model 
training  will  most  likely  be  highly  skewed  towards  one 
class  (that  is  the  non‐defective  or  clean  instance). 
Resampling  approaches  such  as  simple  Random  Over‐
Sampling  (ROS),  Random  Under‐Sampling  (RUS),  and 
synthetic methods such as SMOTE have been proposed to 
alleviate  the  negative  effects  of  class  imbalance  on  the 
performance of Within Project Defect Prediction (WPDP)

models  [21].  Resampling  approaches  aim  to  increase  the 
number of minority class samples (defective modules), and 
they can significantly improve the performance (recall, g‐
mean) of defect prediction models [22].  

The  potential  benefit  of  data  resampling  approaches  in 
mitigating the negative effect of class imbalance on CPDP 
models has been investigated by few researchers. Previous 
studies [23, 12, 24, 25] considered the effect of very few 
data resampling approaches or evaluate the performances 
of  data  resampling  approaches  on  CPDP  using  a  few 
datasets.  Other  studies  propose  complex  methods 
integrated  with  data  resampling  approaches  to  improve 
CPDP performances [26, 27]. A recent systematic literature 
review by Hosseini et al. [16] revealed that most studies in 
CPDP fail to use multiple performance measures and fail to 
apply robust statistical tests, including effect sizes, which 
resulted  in  an  unfair  comparison  of  the  performances  of 
CPDP to WPDP models.  

The motivation of this study is to augment the few existing 
studies  and  examine  the  practical  benefits  of  data 
resampling  approaches  on  CPDP  models.  We  assess  the 
impact of applying eight commonly used data resampling 
(MAHAKIL,  SMOTE,  Borderline‐SMOTE, 
methods 
ADASYN,  ROS,  RUS,  Tomek  links  and  OSS)  in  the 
domain  of  CPDP  after  acquiring  data  from  different 
projects (using the NN filter) and use the resampled data 
datasets for the training of the defect prediction model for 
a  different  project.  Additionally,  we  conduct  robust 
statistical  tests  on  the  results  by  testing  for  statistical 
significance using Brunner’s statistical test [28] and apply 
Cliff’s effect size to examine the practical benefits of the 
applied data resampling approaches. We selected the NN 
filter  because  it  is  easy  to  implement  compared  to  other 
CPDP approaches and has been shown to improve CPDP 
performance in previous studies [29, 14, 16, 15]. To assess 
the  impact  of  data  resampling  approaches  on  NN‐filtered 
datasets,  this  study  explores  the  following  research 
questions.  

1. RQ1:  What 

is 

the 

impact  of  data  resampling 

approaches on NN‐filtered datasets in CPDP?  

2. RQ2:  What  are  the  high‐performing  resampling 

approaches for NN‐filtered datasets in CPDP?  

3. RQ3: Is the application of data resampling approaches 

practical for CPDP?  

The contributions of this paper are as follows:  

•  A benchmark experiment that shows that recall ( 𝑝𝑑 ) 
and g‐mean performances of CPDP can be improved 
by applying data resampling approaches to NN‐filtered 
datasets.  

•  A  demonstration  that  oversampling  and  random 
undersampling  methods  always  produce  higher  false 
alarms  (𝑝𝑓)  in  CPDP.  NN‐filtered  data  with  no 
resampling produces the best pf values.  

•  A  python  package  for  MAHAKIL—an  easy‐to‐use 

tool for oversampling class imbalanced data.  

The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  structured  as  follows: 
Section  2  presents  the  related  work.  In  Section  3,  we 
discuss our methods and experimental settings. Our results 
and  a  discussion  of  the  results  are  reported  in  Sections  5 
and  6,  followed  by  a  discussion  of  potential  threats  to 

validity  in  Section  7.  Finally,  we  present  our  conclusion 
from  this  study  with  potential  future  work  directions  in 
Section 8.  

2. RELATED WORK  

2.1 Cross‐project defect prediction  
One of the first to attempt at developing CPDP models was 
Zimmermann  et  al.  [10].  By  conducting  a  large‐scale 
experiment  on  12  real‐world  datasets,  622  cross‐project 
prediction  models  were  analysed  and  investigated  for  the 
feasibility  of  cross‐company  defect  prediction  (CCDP) 
models. After observing a low success rate of 3.4%, they 
conclude that CCDP is still a challenge. Turhan et al. [11] 
proposed  a  practical  defect  prediction  approach  for 
organizations aiming to employ defect prediction but that 
lacks  historical  data.  Applying  the  principles  of  analogy‐
based learning, they use the k‐nearest neighbour algorithm 
to select 10 nearest data instances from other company data 
for  every  unlabelled  test  instance  for  CCDP.  They 
demonstrated that even small data samples acquired using 
their  approach  could  be  used  to  build  effective  defect 
predictors.  He  et  al.  [30]  conducted  a  large  study  using 
open‐source projects to investigate the feasibility of CPDP, 
considering  careful  data  selection  approaches.  The 
obtained results were similar to those achieved by previous 
studies [10, 11], indicating that CPDP works well in a few 
cases  and  carefully  selecting  the  training  data  improves 
prediction  performance  though  not  necessarily  selecting 
projects in the same domain. A recent benchmark study by 
Herbold et al. [15] complemented the positive impact of the 
data filtering approaches on CPDP models.  

Other  studies,  including  [31,  12,  32,  33],  have  employed 
several  transfer  learning  and  data  boosting  techniques  to 
improve  CPDP  performance.  Considering  two  projects, 
Watanabe et al. [34] conducted an inter‐project prediction 
and demonstrated that data characteristics had an impact on 
the  success  of  cross‐project  predictions.  They  adapted 
CPDP  by  using  a  metric  compensation  method  that 
adjusted  the  average  values  of  each  metric  in  both  the 
training  and  test  set  to  the  same  level  and  achieved  high 
precision  and  recall  values.  Transfer  learning  techniques 
have also been applied in the domain of CPDP. In order to 
make  the  feature  distribution  of  the  source  projects  and 
target  projects  similar,  Nam  et  al.  [31]  applied  Transfer 
Component Analysis, which transforms the data based on 
the  new  feature  representation  discovered  from  both  the 
source and target projects. They found that the prediction 
performance increased significantly after experimenting on 
eight  open‐source  projects.  Similarly,  Yu  et  al.  [32] 
proposed  a  novel  semi‐supervised  clustering‐based  data 
filtering  method  that  filters  the  data  and  adopts  multi‐
source  TrAdaBoost  algorithm,  an  effective 
transfer 
learning method, into cross‐company prediction to import 
knowledge not from one but from multiple sources to avoid 
a negative transfer. Poon et al. [35] proposed a Credibility 
theory‐based  Naive  Bayes  (CNB)  classifier  that  uses  a 
novel re‐weighting mechanism to adapt the source data to 
the  target  data  distribution  simultaneously.  The  method 
ensures that the pattern of the source data and experimental 
results  improved  the  performance  over  other  CPDP 
methods.  The  study  of  Zhou  et  al.  [36]  investigated  the 

2 

 
 
performances of a number of CPDP techniques and models 
with  simple  size  models  and  observed  that  simple  size 
models  in  most  cases  outperformed  the  complex  and 
recently  proposed  CPDP  techniques.  Asano  et  al.  [37] 
applied  bandit  algorithms  to  help  in  selecting  the  most 
suitable  projects  for  CPDP  models.  Our  study  aims  to 
complement  prior  studies  by  aiming  to  improve  the 
performance of existing CPDP models that adopts the NN 
filter approach.  

2.2 Data resampling application in CPDP  
Although the class imbalance issue is known to be critical 
for  defect  prediction  models,  only  a  few  studies  have 
discussed the challenge of class imbalance in the context of 
CPDP.  Ryu  et  al.  [26,  27]  proposed  two  methods,  a 
boosting  and  instance  weighting  technique  that  uses 
transfer learning to solve the class imbalance issue. Jing et 
al.  [38]  employed  a  semi‐  supervised  transfer  component 
analysis  to  balance  the  source  and  target  datasets  before 
transfer 
their  proposed  semi‐  supervised 
applying 
component  analysis  and  improved  subclass  discriminant 
analysis for prediction.  

Most of the previous studies' aim was to improve prediction 
performance by integrating data resampling approaches as 
part of their solutions. A study by Kamei et al. [25] on Just‐
In‐Time  (JIT)  defect  prediction  models  using  11  open‐
source  cross‐projects  revealed  that  JIT  models  rarely 
improved  in  general,  but  did  improve  when  selected 
training projects are similar to the testing data, larger set of 
training  data  is  provided  or  using  ensemble  models.  The 
random  undersampling  approach  was  applied  to  the 
training  datasets  before  training  the  JIT  models.  Other 
studies  have  adopted  the  popular  SMOTE  approach  in 
alleviating the negative effects of class imbalance. Chen et 
al. [12] used the SMOTE resampling approach to balance 
their  training  datasets  before  applying  their  proposed 
Double  Transfer  Boosting  model.  Recently,  Limsettho  et 
al.  [29]  proposed  CDE‐SMOTE  that  adopts  the  SMOTE 
data resampling approach to alleviate the negative effects 
of class distribution mismatch and imbalance between the 
training  and  test  datasets.  The  authors  estimate  the 
proportion  of  each  class  of  the  target  dataset  using  class 
distribution estimation and employ the SMOTE method to 
generate  data  samples  equal  to  the  estimated  amount. 
Additionally,  Goel  et  al.  [23]  observed  that  SMOTE 
improves the performance of CPDP models. Yu et al. [24] 
were the first to conduct an empirical study comprising of 
more than one data resampling approach. They applied six 
data resampling approaches on 15 open‐source datasets and 
three  CPDP  models  and  observed  that  the  performance 
improved  when  data  resampling  approaches  are  applied. 
More  information  on  CPDP  studies  can  be  found  in  the 
recent literature review and meta‐analysis study conducted 
by  Hosseini  et  al.  [16].  The  comprehensive  studies  of 
Bennin et al. [21] and Tantitham-thavorn et al. [39] provide 
more  information  on  the  impact  of  data  resampling 
approaches on software defect prediction models.  

Previous  studies  aim  to  improve  CPDP  performance  by 
using  complex  boosting  and  transfer  learning  techniques. 
Most studies [23, 12, 29, 25] investigated the effects of a 
single  type  of  data  resampling  approach  on  CPDP 
this  paper 
performances.  The  study  presented 

in 

3 

differentiates itself from the studies discussed above, and 
specifically, the study of Yu et al, [24], in which it applies 
eight data resampling approaches to the acquired data after 
applying  an  NN  filter  and  empirically  investigate  the 
impact of data resampling approaches on the performance 
of  CPDP.  Compared 
to  WPDP,  filter‐based  CPDP 
approaches including the NN filter try to generate a project 
dataset that is similar to a target project dataset. This NN 
filter procedure is a simple approach that is independent of 
the prediction model, straightforward to implement and has 
been shown to have a positive impact on CPDP models [17, 
15, 16].  

3. BACKGROUND  

In  this  section,  we  present  a  brief  description  of  the  NN 
filter and an overview of the data resampling approaches 
we employed in our experiments. The NN filter is selected 
because  (1)  it  is  easier  to  implement,  compared  to  other 
(and 
similar  approaches, 
successfully) used in previous studies [29, 14, 40] and (3) 
it  is  known  to  improve  prediction  performance  in 
comparison to other data filtering techniques [16, 15].  

it  has  been  widely 

(2) 

3.1 NN filter  
This approach proposed by Turhan et al. [11] is a relevancy 
filter that effectively selects the closest data instances with 
respect  to  the  new  target  project  from  a  collection  of 
various projects based on the K‐NN algorithm. It is a pre‐
processing  approach  that  could  be  combined  with  the 
normal  classification  process.  It  was  combined  with  a 
Naive Bayes classifier by the same authors. The procedure 
for NN filtering is as follows:  

1. Aggregate and merge all training data into one set of 

data.  

2. For  each  module  in  the  target  project,  find  k 
training  data 

the  combined 

from 

neighbours 
considering their pairwise  

3. Euclidean distances.  

4. Collect the selected neighbours and remove duplicated 

data instances to obtain the filtered dataset.  

3.2 Oversampling approaches  
3.2.1 Random oversampling (ROS)  
ROS  can  be  considered  as  one  of  the  most  basic 
oversampling approaches. Minority instances are randomly 
selected  and  replicated,  and  thus,  no  new  information  is 
provided for the classifier. ROS is very easy to implement 
and  has  been  widely  used  in  several  studies  in  defect 
prediction [41, 19, 21, 42].  

3.2.2  Synthetic  Minority  Oversampling  Technique 
(SMOTE)  
A  technique  designed  to  alleviate  the  effect  of  class 
imbalance on prediction performance [43]. Several defect 
prediction  studies  [44,  45,  46]  have  adopted  and  applied 
SMOTE  in  the  literature.  SMOTE  generates  'synthetic' 
minority  samples  by  considering  each  minority  class 
sample. Based on the parameter values (𝑘), new synthetic 
samples are created along with the line segments that join 
𝑘 minority class NNs of each sample under consideration.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.3 MAHAKIL  
A 
recently  developed  state‐of‐the‐art  oversampling 
technique  that  aims  to  generate  diverse  minority  class 
samples  in  order  to  improve  prediction  performance  and 
reduce false alarms [22]. Different from the conventional 𝑘 
NN methods, MAHAKIL utilizes the chromosomal theory 
of inheritance to generate diverse synthetic data instances. 
MAHAKIL alleviates the overgeneralization of prediction 
models  since  synthetic  data  instances  created  are  not 
clustered into a specific region of the minority class of the 
dataset. The code used in this study (a python package) is 
provided online for future use and replication studies1  

3.2.4 Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN)  
By  focusing  only  on  the  minority  class  samples  that  are 
difficult  to  classify,  the  ADASYN  approach  [47]  assigns 
weights to the minority classes and dynamically adjusts the 
weights in a bid to reduce the bias in the imbalanced dataset 
by considering the characteristics of the data distribution. 
incorporates  a  density 
The  ADASYN  algorithm 
distribution  in  automatically  deciding  the  number  of 
synthetic samples needed for each minority class sample. 
In contrast to the SMOTE algorithm, which generates equal 
synthetic  samples  for  each  minority  class,  the  ADASYN 
learning algorithm is induced to focus on the hard to learn 
examples  within  the  minority  class  samples;  therefore, 
samples generated are not equal for all samples.  

3.2.5 Borderline‐SMOTE  
This  technique  is  a  modification  of  the  original  SMOTE 
[43] that focuses more on the instances that are harder‐to‐
classify, that is, instances on the borderline of the classifier 
[48].  Instances  that  are  marked  as  hard‐to‐classify  are 
labelled and considered for generating new synthetic data 
using SMOTE. Borderline‐SMOTE aims to clearly set the 
decision  boundary  for  the  trained  classifier  for  improved 
prediction performance.  

3.3 Undersampling approaches  
3.3.1 Random undersampling (RUS)  
RUS aims to balance the dataset by randomly selecting and 
deleting the majority of instances. RUS is easy and fast to 
implement. As a conventional technique, it is a widely used 
undersampling technique in several empirical studies [41, 
21, 19, 42].  

3.3.2 Tomek links  
Tomek  [49]  observed  that  instances  of  different  classes 
could  be  very  close  neighbours  and  overlap  each  other. 
These  instances  are  closer  to  each  other  than  they  are  to 
their own class samples, and they form what is referred to 
as Tomek links. The majority of instances that are part of 
the Tomek links are considered as noise and are deleted by 
this  technique  until  all  minimally  distanced  nearest‐
neighbour pairs are of the same class.  

3.3.3 One‐sided selection  
Kubat  et  al.  [50]  proposed  the  undersampling  approach 
called One‐sided selection. This technique aims to remove 
noisy  and  borderline  majority  instances  by  adopting  the 

concept  of  Tomek  links  [49].  The  technique  works  by 
randomly  selecting  a  majority  sample  and  combining  it 
with all minority instances to create a new set S. The new 
set  S  is  used  to  classify  the  original  dataset  and  all 
misclassified instances are added to S. It considers majority 
instances to be redundant if these instances in S participate 
in Tomek links.  

4. EVALUATION AND EMPIRICAL 
ANALYSIS  

The  research  questions  and  experimental  design  and 
execution are described in this section.  

4.1 Research questions and experiment design  
The goal of this study is to empirically examine and assess 
the  impact  of  using  data  resampling  approaches  on  NN‐
filtered datasets used in CPDP models. To achieve our goal, 
we  carried  out  two  sets  of  experiments.  The  experiments 
are conducted and executed to answer the following three 
research questions.  

1. RQ1:  What 

is 

the 

impact  of  data  resampling 

approaches on NN‐filtered datasets in CPDP?  

2. RQ2:  What  are  the  high‐performing  resampling 

approaches for NN‐filtered datasets in CPDP?  

3. RQ3: Is the application of data resampling approaches 

practical for CPDP?  

The research questions are used to examine the impact of 
applying  several  data  resampling  approaches  on  the 
performance  of  the  CPDP.  The  study  considered  only 
defect‐  proneness  (predicting  if  a  module  is  defective  or 
not) and not defect counts. We follow the criteria used by 
Peters et al. [51] and Zimmermann et al. [10] to determine 
if  resampling  approaches  are  beneficial  and  practical  for 
CPDP. The work of Zimmermann et al. [10] demonstrated 
that  a  strong  predictor  is  the  one  that  achieves  g‐mean, 
recall and accuracy above 75%. By using a simple criterion, 
the  total  count  of  test‐sets  with  predictors  (models)  that 
produced g‐mean, recall and auc above 75% are computed. 
Since we include pf measures, we set it as practical if pf is 
less  than  15%.  Detailed  description  on  the  dataset  used, 
experimental setup and analysis is discussed below.  

4.2 Datasets  
We obtained data from thirty‐four (34) versions of twenty‐
two (22) open‐source projects that are extracted from the 
PROMISE  data  repository,  which  are  freely  available2. 
Dataset size, imbalance ratio and projects with more than 
one version all carry heavyweight in our selection criteria, 
though we keep to datasets widely used in previous studies. 
Table  1  shows  a  summary  of  the  description  of  these 
datasets.  These  projects,  donated  by  Jureczko  and 
Madeyski  [13]  and  Jureczko  and  Spinellis  [52],  were 
written in Java where a module corresponds to a Java file. 
We only consider top‐level classes (where the class has the 
same name as the source file, i.e. inner classes are ignored). 
The  datasets  vary  in  size  and  imbalance  ratios,  and  they

provide an extensive domain for evaluating the impact of 
resampling  approaches  and  have  been  used  in  several 
previous  studies.  Twenty‐one  (21)  code  metrics  from  the 
CK  and  other  metrics  suites  (see  Table  2  for  details)  are 
collected  using  the  BugInfo  and  ckjm3  tools  from  each 
module.  A  non‐defective  module  is  labelled  as  zero,  and 
defective  modules  are  labelled  with  the  number  of  bugs 
present  in  the  module.  Projects  that  had  more  than  one 
version  available  were  all  merged  to  create  our  training 
(source)  datasets.  Single‐version  datasets  (the  first  14 
projects) were thus used as the test (target) dataset where 
we applied the NN filter to selectively produce the filtered 
training datasets for each of the test datasets.  

4.3 Evaluation measures  
To assess our modules, we use four performance evaluation 
metrics:  recall  (i.e.  probability  of  detection  [𝑝𝑑]),  Area 
Under the ROC Curve (AUC), g‐measure and Probability 
of  false  alarm  (𝑝𝑓).  These  performance  metrics  range 
between  the  values  of  0%–100%.  We  decided  not  to 
include precision and F‐ measure as they have been refuted 
as unstable for assessing imbalanced datasets [53]. Recall 
(𝑝𝑑)  measures  how  much  of  the  defective  modules  were 
detected.  

In  the  general  sense,  a  higher  recall  denotes  better 
performance. The probability of false alarm ( 𝑝𝑓) measures 
the  rate  of  wrongly  predicted  modules  that  were  non‐
defective.  A  low  or  zero  value  for  pf  implies  a  better 
prediction  model.  For  a  highly  imbalanced  dataset,  the 
AUC  and  g‐measure  (g‐mean)  performance  metrics  are 
preferred as they consider both the pf and pd values and do 
not  value  one  metric  over  the  other.  AUC  has  also  been 
recommended to be very stable for imbalance learning [21, 
39].  For  practical  results,  Zimmermann  et  al.  [10] 
recommend pd values of 75% and above, which is maybe 
very challenging to achieve in CPDP studies. Herbold et al. 
[15]  also  observed  that  CPDP  models  rarely  achieved  a 
high recall of 75%. We use multiple performance measures 
to fully grasp the capabilities and dynamics of the examined 
prediction models and resampling methods as noted by the 
authors in [16]. The mathematical definitions of 𝑝𝑑, 𝑝𝑓 and 
𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 metrics are presented below. Computation of 
the AUC of ROC can be found elsewhere [54].

resampling methods and the NN filter was executed using 
Imbalanced‐ learn [55], an open‐source processing toolbox 
and the model construction and evaluation were executed 
using the open‐ source scikit learn [56] library available in 
python. We use all metrics from the datasets as suggested 
in [2]. For this study, five methods widely used in defect

(ADASYN) and three undersampling approaches (i.e. 
RUS,  OSS,  Tomek  Links)  are  applied  to  the  filtered 
dataset to generate exactly the same number of samples 
for  the  minority  class  and  reduce  the  samples  of  the 
majority  class,  respectively,  in  the  dataset.  For  both 
SMOTE and ADASYN, we set 𝑘 = 5 as used by the 
original  authors  of  these  approaches  [47,  43].  Each 
data  resampling  approach  is  applied  separately,  and 
hence, a total of 84 (14 datasets × 6 prediction models) 
CPDP  models  are  conducted  for  each  resampling 
approach.  Overall,  672

approaches)  CPDPs  are  conducted  across  all 
resampling  approaches.  Algorithm  1  displays  the 
procedure followed in conducting experiment 2.

4.4.1 Statistical test and comparison  
As recommended by Kitchenham et al. [59] and Hosseini 
et al. [16], the application of non‐parametric statistical tests 
and effect sizes to empirical studies in software engineering 
are beneficial to produce more practical and relevant results 
for valid conclusions and insights. We compare the results 
of the performance measures using the original NN‐filtered 
dataset  (represented  as  NOS)  and  that  of  using  the 
resampled  data  (NN‐filtered  datasets  modified  with  data 
resampling  approaches).  To  analyse 
the  statistical 
significance  of  the  prediction  performance  of  models 
trained  on  the  original  NN  filter  and  resampled  dataset 
experiments,  Brunner’s  statistical  test  [28]  is  adopted  for 
pairwise  comparison.  Across  all 
four  performance 
measures, the Win‐Tie‐Loss values are computed for each 
pairwise  comparison  and  presented  to  clearly  show  any 
in  prediction  performances. 
significant  difference 
Brunner’s  statistical  test  was  recently  recommended  as  a 
more robust alternative to the t‐test for empirical studies in 
software  engineering  [59].  For  each  selected  prediction 
model and training dataset, Brunner’s test is performed  

prediction  studies  were  chosen.  We  considered  Random 
Forests, Naive Bayes, K‐NN algorithm, NNET and SVM 
[1]. Furthermore, we adopted a recently proposed boosting 
model  called  XGBoost  [57].  XGBoost  is  an  improved 
implementation  of  a  gradient  boosting 
framework 
optimized  to  be  highly  efficient,  effective  and  better 
performance  [57,  58].  The  parameters  used  for  the 
prediction  models  are  displayed  in  Table  3.  It  should  be 
noted that we predicted the presence of defects (binary) in 
a module and not the number of defects (continuous). The 
two main experiments conducted are summarized in Figure 
1 and described below:  

1)  Applying  NN  Filter:  we 

first  examined 

the 
performance of the defect prediction models when the 
NN filter procedure (described in Section 3.1) is used 
in selecting the training data. Considering 14 test and 
20  training  datasets,  we  conducted  14  cross‐project 
experiments  where  the  training  datasets  are  merged 
and used by the test data for filtering to extract the NN 
modified training data. Following the procedure used 
by the original creators of the NN filter [11], we used 
𝑘	=10 for the NN filter experiments. The models are 
trained on the filtered datasets. After model training, 
the  model  is  tested  on  a  separate  test  dataset  and 
evaluated using the performance measures discussed in 
Section  4.3.  Our  experiment  algorithm  is  shown  in 
Algorithm 1. The NN filter experiment starts from step 
1  and  stops  at  step  6,  with  a  sequential  flow.  The 
process  continues  from  step  10  through  to  step  13 
where  the  classifiers  are  constructed  on  the  filtered 
𝑃!"#$%& instead of the resampled data 𝑃’().  

2)  Resampled Datasets for CPDP: similar to experiment 
1, we only modify the training data after applying the 
NN  filter.  For  the  second  experiment,  the  five 
oversampling approaches discussed in Section 3.2 (i.e. 
ROS, MAHAKIL, SMOTE, Borderline‐SMOTE and

across the cross‐project pairs for each performance measure 
and  the  Win,  Tie  or  Loss  value  is  reported  based  on  the 
significant value at 𝑝	 < 	0.05 two‐tailed test.  

We also apply Cliff’s effect size with Hochberg’s method 
proposed by the authors in [28], which measures the size 
(no  effect,  small,  medium,  large)  of  values  between  two 
distributions. The magnitude labels for the effect sizes (𝛿C) 
are  interpreted  using  the  thresholds  (small  [𝛿C  ≤  0.112], 
medium [0.112 > 𝛿C < 0.428] and large 𝛿C ≥ 0.428]) proposed 
in [60].  

5. RESULTS 

Here, we present our results, which is presented based on 
the three research questions we address in this paper.  

5.1  RQ1:  What  is  the  impact  of  data  resampling 
approaches on NN‐filtered datasets in CPDP?  
For better demonstration, the results are presented in Figure 
2  using  quartile  plots.  The  quartile  plot  displays  the 
variation  of  the  results  produced  by  each  resampling 
approach for each prediction model on the 14 datasets. For 
each performance measure, the quartile plot compares the 
performance  of  each  resampling  approach  for  each 
prediction model. These plots are generated by sorting the 
performance  values  for  all  14  test  datasets  to  isolate  the 
median,  lower  and  upper  quartiles.  In  the  performance 
results in Figure 2, the median is displayed by a solid dot 

7 

and  the  quartile  limits  represent  the  25th  and  75th 
percentiles.  

Higher  medians  denote  better  performance  for  all 
performance measures except the 𝑝𝑓 measure, where lower 
median  values  denote  better  performance.  The  AUC 
performance  values  were  comparable  for  all  prediction 
models  and  resampling  approaches.  Data  resampling 
approaches did not significantly improve AUC prediction 
performance  values.  Prediction  models 
trained  on 
resampled datasets produced better result values on average 
for  the  𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛  and  recall(𝑝𝑑)  values  but  performed 
poorly for the 𝑝𝑓 performance measure.  

Models  trained  on  the  resampled  datasets  attained  higher 
recall (𝑝𝑑) and 𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 values over models trained on the 
default  NN‐filtered  datasets  (represented  as  NOS).  All 
oversampling methods and the RUS method improved the 
pd  and  𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛  values.  Tomek  links  and  One‐Sided 
Selection (OSS) approaches did not significantly improve 
the 𝑝𝑑 and 𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 values compared to the default NN‐
filtered  datasets  (NOS)  results.  Models  trained  on  the 
default  NN‐filtered  datasets  (NOS)  performed  well  with 
very  low  𝑝𝑓.  The  models  trained  on  resampled  datasets, 
however,  attained  high  𝑝𝑓  comparatively.  This  confirms, 
the conclusion previously made by Turhan et al. [11], that 
higher  𝑝𝑑  values  are  accompanied  by  higher  pf  values. 
Most  of 
the  RUS 
the  oversampling  methods  and 
undersampling method result in higher 𝑝𝑓 across all models 
except  NB.  We  observe  that  no  single  prediction  model 
performed  best  for  all  target  datasets  considering  all  the 
performance  measures.  This  could  be  explained  by  the 
difference in class distribution within the target datasets.  

the  prediction  models, 

5.2  RQ2:  What  are  the  high‐performing  resampling 
approaches for NN‐filtered datasets in CPDP?  
To  find  the  statistical  significant  differences  between  the 
performances of the default NN‐filtered datasets (NOS) and 
resampled  datasets  on 
total 
aggregated  win‐tie‐loss  values  from  Brunner’s  statistical 
test  are  presented  in  Tables  4  and  5.  Due  to  space 
limitations, we present the top 14 and bottom 14 per each 
performance measure. Considering the AUC performance 
measure,  we  observe  from  Table  4  that  the  use  of  data 
resampling approaches could not improve the CPDP for all 
models. Out of the 54 pairwise Win‐Tie‐Loss comparisons, 
all resampling approaches combined with the Naive Bayes 
classifier  were  found  in  the  bottom  half  with  Borderline‐
SMOTE  and  RUS  outperforming  the  other  resampling 
approaches.  The  majority  of  the  tests  resulted  in  ties  and 
very few losses. Notwithstanding, resampling approaches 
performed  worse  for  the  Random  Forest  and  XGBoost 
models.  However,  we  observe  that  the  losses  are  few 
compared to the three performance measures (𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛, 𝑝𝑑 
and 𝑝𝑓). Considering the g‐mean and recall (𝑝𝑑) win‐tie‐
loss  comparison  results  in  Table  4,  the  prediction 
performances on the resampled datasets were statistically 
significant and different from the prediction performances 
on the original NN‐filtered data. The models trained on the 
default NN‐filtered data were always found in the bottom 
half of the table indicating that data resampling approaches 
were always better than no sampling method.

(across all 14-test datasets) 

However,  the  models  trained  on  the  default  NN‐filtered 
datasets (NOS) were significantly improved regarding the 
𝑝𝑓  performance  measure,  thus  outperforming  most  data 
resampling  approaches.  The  next  best  performing  data 
resampling  approaches  were  the  undersampling  methods 
Tomek links and OSS. Random under and oversampling, 
SMOTE and ADA-SYN recorded less than three wins with 
the highest number of losses.  

Furthermore,  we  compute  the  overall  effect  sizes  after 
conducting  the  win‐tie‐loss  statistical  tests  across  all 
datasets  and  present  the  results  in  Figure  3.  As  shown  in 
Figure  3,  the  performance  values  of  the  default  models 
(NOS) is compared to each resampling approach across all 
datasets  and  the  win‐  tie‐loss  statistic  is  recorded. 
Additionally,  the  practical  effect  (effect  sizes)  of  the 
statistical results are also computed and presented in Figure 
3.  For  each  pairwise  comparison,  the  wins,  ties  or  losses 
(represented with square shapes) and the magnitude of the 
effect  size  (represented  with  circle  shapes)  across  all 
datasets per each performance measure are presented.  

Considering  the  AUC  performance  measure,  we  observe 
from Figure 3 that the use of data resampling approaches 
could not improve the cross‐project prediction performance 
for  all  models.  Out  of  the  pairwise  Win‐Tie‐Loss 
comparison,  the  majority  of  the  tests  resulted  in  ties  and 
only two wins for MAHAKIL and one win for BSMOTE. 
The  wins  were,  however,  not  practically  significant  (no 
effect).  There  were  no  losses.  This  is  in  agreement  with 
prediction performance in within‐project defect prediction 
where the AUC prediction performance of models trained 
on resampled datasets was not significantly different from 
that trained on default datasets [21].  

Considering  the  𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛  and  recall  (𝑝𝑑)  win‐tie‐loss 
comparison results in Figure 3, the prediction performances 
on the resampled datasets were statistically significant and 
different from the prediction performances on the original 
NN  filtered  data.  The  data  resampling  approaches 
specifically the oversampling and Random undersampling 
approaches  significantly  outperformed  the  NOS  method 
mostly achieving large effect sizes (green square and red 
circle). For most pairwise comparisons, the data resampling 
approaches achieved significant (win) statistical tests and 
few no effects as the effect size status. However, the models 
trained  on  the  default  NN‐filtered  datasets  (NOS)  were 
significantly better regarding the pf performance measure, 
thus  outperforming  most  data  resampling  approaches.  In 
agreement  with  the  results  in  Table  4,  the  next  best 
performing  data 
the 
undersampling  approaches  Tomek  links  and  OSS.  This 
indicates  that  the  combining  data  resampling  approaches 
with the original NN‐filtered data should be avoided if we 
aim at achieving lower pf values while the data resampling 
approaches  should  be  considered  when  higher  𝑝𝑑  and 
𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 values are required.  

resampling  approaches  were 

5.3  RQ3:  Is  the  application  of  data  resampling 
approaches practical and beneficial for CPDP?  
the  practical  benefits  of  data  sampling 
To  assess 
approaches,  the  actual  number  of  test  sets  that  meet  the 
practical  criteria  of  75%  for  all  performance  measures 
except  pf,  where  the  criterion  is  15%,  is  summarised  in 
Figure 4. For each performance measure, after 756 (14 × 6 
× 9) runs across all 14 test sets, six prediction models and 
nine  sampling  methods,  the  success  rates  were  very  low. 
All  data  resampling  approaches  attained  success  rates  of 
less than 10% for the AUC and g‐mean performance

measures.  Similarly,  all 
excluding  the  RUS  and  ADASYN  also  attained  success 
rates  of  less  than  10%  for  the  recall  (pd)  performance 
measure.  RUS  attained  the  highest  success  rate  (22.6%) 
considering  the  pd  performance  measure,  whereas  OSS 
attained  the  lowest  success  rate  (1.19).  The  default  NN 
filter approach (NOS) attained lower success rates for pd, 
AUC  and  𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛  than  the  oversampling  methods 
indicating that data resampling methods with the NN filter 
result in better performance. However, for false alarms (pf), 
the  default  NN  filter  attained  the  highest  success  rate 
closely  followed  by  OSS  and  TOMEK  links.  RUS 
performed worse for the pf measure with the oversampling 
methods attaining higher success rates than RUS.  

resampling  approaches  significantly 

In summary, our results show the following: (1) The use of 
data 
improved 
prediction  performance  (𝑝𝑑,  𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛).  Considering  the 
number of ties and losses, there was a statistical difference 

between the performances of the prediction models trained 
on  resampled  data  and  the  original  filtered  data.  (2)  To 
attain better pf values, the default NN‐filtered data should 
not  be  combined  with  data  resampling  approaches.  (3) 
Similar  to  observations  from  WPDP  [21,  39],  the 
performance of AUC is not significantly impacted by data 
resampling methods for CPDP models. 

6. DISCUSSIONS  

The  experimental  results  indicate  that  data  resampling 
approaches significantly impact the performance of CPDP 
models. Comparatively, the oversampling approaches out-
performed  the  undersampling  approaches  regarding  the 
𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛  and  𝑝𝑑  performance  values.  The  experimental 
results show that the NN filter alone (NOS) obtained very 
low practical results, suggesting data sampling methods are 
needed in addition to the NN filter method to obtain more

the 14 datasets per each performance measure 

significant  and  practical  results.  Conventional  sampling 
approaches such as the SMOTE, RUS and ROS produced 
significant  and  improved  performance  results  but  were 
accompanied with a high false alarm rate.  

Predictors that generalize well on training data are known 
to perform better than models trained on restricted/few data 
samples. Training prediction models on very large (infinite) 
training  datasets  that  capture  all  variations  in  the  data 
distribution  is  ideal  for  higher  and  improved  prediction 
performance. Due to the inability to obtain infinite training 
datasets, it has been recommended to extend the training set 
with  artificially  created  examples  that  increases  the 
diversity  within  the  data  distribution  [61].  It  was  also 
suggested  that  a  variety  of  (diverse)  data  samples  will 
significantly 
the  prediction  performance. 
However, this was not the case for CPDP as the diversity‐
based  oversampling  approach  (MAHAKIL),  although 
improving  performance,  could  not  outperform  the  more 

improve 

conventional approaches, which do not necessarily increase 
the diversity within the dataset. This is because MAHAKIL 
aims to carefully generate diverse minority class instances 
in a specified region reducing the false alarms. However, 
with  the  NN  Filter  and  CPDP  whereby  data  samples  are 
selected from different projects, the final obtained datasets 
for training will be by default diverse. MAHAKIL will thus 
generate  very  few  or  limited  diverse  instances  and  this 
affects 
the  performance.  Nevertheless,  MAHAKIL 
outperforms the other oversampling approaches regarding 
lower  pf  values.  Similarly,  TOMEK  and  OSS 
undersampling  approaches  significantly  resulted  in  lower 
𝑝𝑓  values  compared  to  the  traditional  RUS  approach. 
Quality assurance teams will prefer MAHAKIL, TOMEK 
and OSS over the other conventional sampling approaches 
since low pf values are preferred by these teams.  

Additionally,  our  analysis  revealed  that,  although  the 
performance of data resampling approaches on the CPDP

Figure 4. Measuring the practical success of sampling approaches on cross-project defect prediction by the percent of test sets 
whose defects were predicted and met the criteria for pd, AUC and g-mean greater than 75% and pf less than 15% 

models did improve the AUC values, the values were not  
too high, ranging between 45% and 65% across all models 
(see Figure 2). This is confirmed by the low success rates 
(<10%) obtained as presented in Figure 4. Data resampling 
approaches, especially the oversampling approaches, with 
the Naive Bayes model produced the highest AUC values. 

The  AUC  performance  metric  is  useful  in  ranking  or 
prioritizing  the  crucial  target  samples  [62],  which  is  the 
defective modules in our experiment. A perfect AUC value 
of 100% implies that all modules are efficiently ranked—
assigning higher priorities to the defective modules than the 
non‐defective  modules.  An  average  AUC  value  of  50% 

11 

 
 
 
indicates that a random prioritization is no worse than the 
prioritization using the advanced model (resampled dataset 
and  prediction  model).  With  very  small  practical  AUC 
values,  the  use  of  data  resampling  approaches  for 
prioritization  of  modules  for  quality  assurance  activities 
(such as testing and code review) is not recommended for 
software projects. With large 𝑝𝑓 values, the selection of top 
𝑘% faulty modules will always be contaminated with the 
non‐defective modules. Notwithstanding, data resampling 
approaches have a silver lining. They can aid in classifying 
all defective modules.  

7. THREATS TO VALIDITY  

there  are  several  potential 
As  an  empirical  study, 
limitations.  We  discuss  below  the  internal  and  external 
threats  to  the  validity  of  the  study.  The  main  external 
limitation  of  this  study  is  that  it  is  dependent  on  the  NN 
filter. All experiments were conducted using the NN filter 
as  the  preprocessor  of  the  dataset.  As  stated  in  the 
introduction,  the  NN  filter  has  been  widely  evaluated  as 
having a positive impact on CPDP models. Studies without 
the use of the NN filter is left as future work. Considering 
only  open‐source  software  projects  with  source  code 
metrics  poses  an  external  threat.  These  metrics  extracted 
with automated software are easy to collect but the results 
cannot  be  generalized  to  all  other  projects  that  have 
different metrics apart from static code or to projects in the 
commercial  domain.  Also, 
the  number  of  projects 
considered  could  have  an  effect  on  our  results.  We, 
however,  considered  a  wide  range  and  sufficient  sizes  of 
projects and, therefore, produced robust results, which we 
expect  to  be  similar  for  other  unconsidered  projects.  We 
intend  to  consider  commercial  projects  in  future  studies. 
The  selection  of  our  source  and  target  data  also  poses  a 
threat  to  our  results.  Since  we  only  considered  single‐
version projects as our target projects, it is unclear if our 
results would generalize to the other datasets, which were 
not  used  as  the  source  data.  Further  work  where  every 
project is considered as a target project is required to clarify 
this.  

A  limited  number  of  predictive  models  were  also 
considered  in  this  paper.  Considering  different  types  of 
predictive  models  could  have  different  implications. 
However,  these  are  widely  used  models  in  past  studies. 
Similarly,  the  number  of  neighbours  chosen  for  the  NN 
filter had an impact on our results. Exploring large values 
for these neighbours could lead to different results since the 
filtered dataset sizes would be affected. We considered four 
major  performance  measures,  which  are  widely  used  for 
defect  prediction  on  class  imbalanced  datasets.  Other 
evaluation  measures  such  as  the  effort‐aware  measures 
could be considered in future studies.  

8. CONCLUSION  

This paper investigates the impact of using data sampling 
methods for improving the performance of CPDP models. 
Employing  eight  data 
resampling  approaches,  we 
resampled  the  datasets  and  used  them  in  training  CPDP 
models after filtering the training data using the NN filter. 
The  data  resampling  methods  did  improve  the  prediction 

performance  as  expected  by  significantly  improving  the 
recall (𝑝𝑑) and 𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 performance measures. The use of 
the default NN‐ filtered dataset was significantly better than 
the  resampled  data  in  terms  of  the  false  alarms  (𝑝𝑓). 
However,  data  resampling  methods  did  not  improve  the 
AUC performance values. For practical results, AUC and 
𝑔- 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 results of all models attained success rates of less 
than  10%.  Random  undersampling  improved  the  recall 
values  but  that  was  accompanied  with  high  false  alarms. 
The  experiments  demonstrated 
that  data  resampling 
methods  could  mitigate  the  negative  effects  of  class 
imbalance  on  the  performance  of  CPDP  in  terms  of 
improving the probability of detection (recall).  

From  these  results,  we  have  demonstrated  that  data 
resampling  methods  should  be  adopted  for  constructing 
prediction models in a bid of reducing the negative effects 
of class imbalance within a dataset obtained from several 
projects. This study lays the foundation for further future 
works.  We  aim  to  investigate  the  use  of  cost‐sensitive 
techniques  for  CPDP.  With  a  low  practical  success  rate 
(less  than  10%),  a  further  empirical  study  is  required  to 
investigate  how  prediction  performance  can  be  improved 
using other methods.
