Abstract—Automatic reconﬁguration of optical ﬁlters is the
key to novel ﬂexible RF photonic receivers and Software Deﬁned
Radios (SDRs). Although silicon photonics (SiP) is a promising
technology platform to realize such receivers, process variations
and lack of in-situ tuning capability limits the adoption of SiP
ﬁlters in widely-tunable RF photonic receivers. To address this
issue, this work presents a ﬁrst ‘in-situ’ automatic reconﬁguration
algorithm and demonstrates a software conﬁgurable integrated
optical ﬁlter that can be reconﬁgured on-the-ﬂy based on user
speciﬁcations. The presented reconﬁguration scheme avoids the
use of expensive and bulky equipment such as Optical Vector
Network Analyzer (OVNA), does not use simulation data for
reconﬁguration, reduces the total number of thermo-optic tun-
ing elements required and eliminates several time consuming
conﬁguration steps as in the prior art. This makes this ﬁlter
ideal
in a real world scenario where user speciﬁes the ﬁlter
center frequency, bandwidth, required rejection & ﬁlter type
(Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) and the ﬁlter is automatically
conﬁgured regardless of process, voltage & temperature (PVT)
variations. We fabricated our design in AIM Photonics’ Active
SiP process and have demonstrated our reconﬁguration algorithm
for a second-order ﬁlter with 3dB bandwidth of 3 GHz, 2.2
dB insertion loss and >30 dB out-of-band rejection using only
two reference laser wavelength settings. Since the ﬁlter photonic
integrated circuit (PIC) is fabricated using a CMOS-compatible
SiP foundry, the design is manufacturable with repeatable and
scalable performance suited for its integration with electronics
to realize complex chip-scale RF photonic systems.

I. INTRODUCTION

I NTEGRATED radio-frequency (RF) photonics is rapidly

emerging as a technology enabler of demanding application
scenarios which require capabilities beyond those of traditional
electronic systems. These capabilities include ultra-wide band-
width, exceptional low latency, long-distance routing and im-
munity to electromagnetic interference (EMI) [1]–[6]. For any
RF photonic integrated circuit (IC), optical ﬁlters are essential
building blocks. The desirable feature that distinguishes RF
photonic ﬁlters from their electronic, microwave and micro-
electromechanical systems (MEMS) counterparts is their tun-
ability over a very wide range of center frequencies (1 to 100s
of GHz) and very wide bandwidth. Consequently, RF photonic
ﬁlters offer unprecedented reconﬁguration capabilities (center

frequency, bandwidth, ﬁlter type, and rejection) that is incon-
ceivable with electronic ICs alone [2], [6]. However, for their
wider adoption in frequency-agile RF photonic receivers or
Software Deﬁned Radios (SDR), ﬁlter reconﬁguration has to
be rapid and in-situ, i.e., automatic and free from any manual
intervention [7].

Traditionally, RF photonic systems have been implemented
using discrete and bulky photonic components that are power
inefﬁcient, expensive and most importantly, are not amenable
to integration of complex systems. Silicon Photonics, on the
other hand, leverages the unique capabilities of photonic signal
processing while takes full advantage of the mature CMOS-
like fabrication processes developed by the semiconductor
industry [7]–[9]. This means, an optical ﬁlter realized in a
silicon photonic platform is area and power efﬁcient, robust,
scalable and can be manufactured on large-scale at a lower
cost. However, due to process-induced random variations, any
ﬁlter designed in a silicon photonic process will deviate from
its intended characteristics. Therefore, a scheme is required
that not only reconﬁgures the ﬁlter automatically but also
is robust against process, voltage and temperature (PVT)
variations.

Reconﬁguration and tuning of integrated optical ﬁlters
has been pursued in the literature. In ref. [10], only center
frequency tuning was addressed whereas in refs. [11]–[14],
both center frequency and bandwidth were tunable. However,
none of these works pursued out-of-band rejection tuning in
the ﬁlter. Moreover, the ﬁlter reconﬁguration was not fully
automatic and heavily relied upon manual tuning. The ﬁrst
fully automatic tuning of silicon photonic ﬁlter was recently
demonstrated in a path-breaking work by Choo et. al. in ref.
[7]. However, the reconﬁguration process involved the use of
bulky and cost prohibitive equipment, i.e., an Optical Vector
Network Analyzer (OVNA) to extract ring losses using Jones
Matrix based method [7], [15].

The fundamental novelty of this work is that it achieves
a truly in-situ automatic optical ﬁlter reconﬁguration solution
that has been experimentally demonstrated using a CMOS-
compatible silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic process. We
present an algorithm different from the one in ref. [7] which
precludes the use of OVNA and eliminates several time con-
suming steps during the reconﬁguration process. In addition,
our ﬁlter also uses less number of thermal tuning elements than
[7]. The designed ﬁlter has a compact form factor and is the
ﬁrst such ﬁlter fabricated in AIM Photonics’ Active Photonic
process. Furthermore, a simpliﬁed analytical framework for

couplers is provided and the ﬁlter PIC simulation leverages

II. FILTER DESIGN, FABRICATION AND PACKAGING

A. Filter Topology

The schematic of the second-order ﬁlter topology used in
this work is shown in Fig. 1. The input continuous-wave
(CW) laser is fed to both arms of an outer Mach Zehnder
Interferometer (MZI) through a 3dB coupler. Each arm of the
MZI is loaded with a microring (UR/LR) via a tunable coupler
(UR-C/LR-C) and quadrature phase-shifter (Q-PS). The two
tunable couplers are in turn realized using a 2 × 2 MZI switch
as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. Another tunable coupler (Back
coupler, B-C) is used at the end of the MZI to allow control
over the residual imbalance in the optical ﬁeld between the two
arms of MZI caused by process variations. To monitor the ring
resonance, a 1% tap followed by an on-chip Ge-photodetector
(PD) is used in each ring. Although this directly translates to
increased passband loss of the ﬁlter, these taps are an integral
part of the automatic software reconﬁguration algorithm [7].
Another 10% monitor tap is used at the cross port of the ﬁlter
for out-of-band rejection tuning. The automatic calibration
and tuning algorithm are implemented with the help of on-
chip thermo-optic phase-shifters or microheaters. Both arms
of the outer MZI, both the rings, and all three tunable couplers
employ microheaters.

As mentioned earlier, the three tunable couplers used in
the RF photonic ﬁlter are realized using 2 × 2 analog MZI
switches. The coupling matrix, C, for these switches is ex-
pressed as [17]

are the cross and through optical power coupling coefﬁcients
respectively. The additional phase φA0 = 2πc∆τ
neffλ is due to the
propagation delay, ∆τ , in the switch due to its physical length.
Here, neff is the effective index. Moreover, φU and φL, are the
phase shifts induced in the upper and lower arm microheaters
in the switch respectively. By tuning φD, we obtain the power
cross-coupling coefﬁcient

k = cos2(φD) =

and the through-coupling coefﬁcient, t = sin2(2φD). The
(cross-)coupling coefﬁcient k is tuned by applying microheater
electrical power, Pc, to one of the two microheaters in the
switch (i.e. φU = 2φD and φL = 0). This implies the
common-mode phase shift is given by

φA =

Also, in Eq. 4, ϕ0 represents the random phase offset in the
switch and γ is a proportionality constant relating the applied
power to the thermo-optic phase-shifter.

The z-domain through (all-pass) and drop (bandpass) trans-
fer functions of a single ring in the ﬁlter seen in Fig. 1 are

cient and phase shift in the nth ring, kbc and tbc = 1 − kbc

and φq,ps is the quadrature phase shift.

B. Filter Synthesis

D1(z) and A2(z) = A∗

Filter design starts with the synthesis of a polynomial,
G(z), for the speciﬁed ﬁlter type and speciﬁcations. Then the
denominators of the coupled all-pass polynomials, D1,2(z),
corresponding to G(z), and constant phase β were obtained
using the tf2ca function in Matlab™. Then numerators
were obtained using N1(z) = ﬂiplr(D∗
1(z)) and N2(z) =
ﬂiplr(D∗
2(z)). This yielded the two all-pass transfer functions
1(z∗) = e−jβ N2(z)
A1(z) = ejβ N1(z)
D2(z) .
Next, the all-pass transfer functions A1,2(z) are mapped to
the (cascade of) ring resonators in the upper and lower arms.
If the roots of denominators D1(z), i.e. the poles of A1(z), are
pn, then the cross-coupling coefﬁcients are determined using
kn = (1 − |pn|2) and tn = |pn|2. The phase φn = ∠pn.
The quadrature phase shift for the upper arm is obtained as
φq,ps = β − (cid:80)
n φn. The lower arm coupling coefﬁcients are
identical to those of the upper arm, and φn and φq,ps are of
opposite sign, representing the conjugate APF responses. In
this work, we used a 2nd-order Butterworth response with a
normalized cutoff frequency of ωn = 0.13. The synthesized
ﬁlter coefﬁcients for the ﬁlter speciﬁcations are listed in Table
I.

C. PIC Design and Fabrication

The ﬁlter was designed and fabricated in AIM Photonics
foundry’s 300mm Active Photonics process [21]. This design

was a part of AIM’s MPW run in June, 2019. Fig. 2 shows
a 3D visualization of the ﬁlter schematic seen in Fig. 1,
and the process cross-section. This process features silicon-
on-insulator (SOI) rib and ridge waveguides, silicon nitride
waveguides, escalators, modulator doping, Germanium (Ge)
detectors, and three metal layers for routing [21]–[23]. The
PIC layout employed several process-optimized components
from the PDK library [18], [22], [23]. Grating couplers (GC)
were used for vertical coupling of light into the PIC. Single-
mode silicon waveguides of 480nm width and 220nm height
were used for routing and interconnecting the optical com-
ponents in TE polarization. The analog 2 × 2 switches were
realized using doped silicon waveguide microheater sections
and 3-dB couplers [24], and with a measured thermo-optic
time-constant of ∼ 15µs. The physical lengths of the micro-
heaters and 2 × 2 switches are around 100µm and 550µm,
respectively.

The ﬁlter was simulated using Lumerical Interconnect [25]
with the AIM PDK library, as well as our open-source Python-
based PIC simulator [16] built using the PhotonTorch photonic
simulation framework [26]. Fig. 3(a) shows the simulated
bar and cross responses of the ﬁlter after including all PIC
parameters including the losses and delays. The peak of the
optical monitors are aligned to the desired resonance frequency
(or wavelength), corresponding to the ring phase, φn, for each
of the rings. The simulated passband loss using the synthesized
ﬁlter coefﬁcients was ∼2.2 dB due to the ring losses with a
3dB bandwidth (BW) of 3 GHz and an out-of-band rejection
of >30dB. The pole-zero plots for APFs, and bar and cross
responses, i.e. G(z) and H(z) respectively, are shown in Fig.
3(b).

The ﬁlter layout was compacted as much as possible to
share the photonic chip with other RF photonic circuits. The
rings were routed in a compact serpentine fashion with a
30µm bend radius for lower loss and reﬂections. The resulting

total physical length of the rings were ∼2200µm each, with
a corresponding free-spectral range (FSR) of around 31GHz.
The monitor taps were realized using 1% and 10% couplers,
Ge waveguide detectors and waveguide terminations. The ﬁlter
die micrograph is shown in Fig. 4(a). The ﬁlter core layout
occupied 1.12 mm2 area on this chip.

D. Packaging and Electronic Back-end

The fabricated PIC die was polished down to 150µm and
packaged in a chip-on-bard (COB) assembly as shown in
Fig. 4(b & c). A Peltier cell and thermistor were used along
with a thermo-electric cooler (TEC) controller in a closed-
loop to stabilize the temperature of the chip and to minimize
the thermal crosstalk among the on-chip tuning elements. The
combination of die thinning and TEC at the bottom of the die
provides effective thermal isolation by creating a prominent
thermal gradient in the vertical direction [7].

The electrical pads were placed on two rows on the East
edge of the PIC which were wire-bonded with two rows
of PCB pads. The optical monitors were connected to the
on-board transimpedance ampliﬁers (TIAs), whose outputs
were interfaced with commercial off the shelf (COTS) 16-
bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) using a ribbon cable.
These pads provide 16-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs)
the DACs and ADCs
interfaces to the microheaters. All
communicate via SPI interface with a microcontroller, which
provides a software abstraction to the algorithm code.

The operating voltage range of the microheaters is from 0 to
5V and requires a power of Pπ ≈ 30mW for an optical phase
shift of π. These voltage ranges are CMOS-compatible and the

packaging. The PCB contains transimpedance ampliﬁers (TIAs) and ribbon

COB assembly is co-packaged with a thermistor on the top-side and a Peltier

microheater driver circuits can be implemented using stacked
high-voltage I/O transistors with a 5V supply voltage in 65nm
CMOS (or similar) process technology [27], [28]. The TIA
interface with the PDs and the 16-bit DACs and ADCs can
be designed using the standard transistors in CMOS, allowing
future integration of all electronics on the same chip.

III. IN-SITU COMPONENT PARAMETER EXTRACTION

To reconﬁgure the SiP ﬁlter, device parameters such as
the coupling ratio of the tunable couplers (kn) and the ring
phase bias (φn) for the selected center wavelength (λc) need
to be conﬁgured. Here, n = 1, 2, . . . N stands for the ring
number. These parameters are controlled by the DAC voltage
(or power). Due to PVT variations in the photonic chip, there
is a signiﬁcant variation in the response of the tunable couplers
and the phase shifters with respect to the applied power. Thus,
no two couplers (or phase shifters) produce the same coupling
(phase shift) for a given applied DAC voltage.

The phase shift, φn, produced by the microheaters linearly

depends upon the applied electrical power, Pn, as

φn = γPn =

πPn
Pπ

(9)

However, the microheater resistance, R, exhibits nonlinear-
ity due to self-heating. Thus, applied electrical power has a
nontrivial nonlinear dependence on the applied DAC voltage,
Pn = f (vn) (cid:54)= v2
R . This Pn vs vn characteristics must also
be extracted so that we can accurately conﬁgure component
parameters on the chip using the DACs. This necessitates an
one-time in-situ pre-characterization of each of these compo-
nents, and subsequently the conﬁguration of them, as they are

In this section, we provide algorithms for these pre-
characterization routines and conﬁguration.

Each of these component characterization have two steps-
Part I and II. The ﬁrst part, Part I, for either kn or φn ex-
traction represents the component pre-characterization phase.
On the other hand, during the automatic reconﬁguration phase,
this pre-characterized data is used for in-situ estimation and
conﬁguration of kn and φn parameters in the on-chip ﬁlter.
Part II algorithms for both kn and φn represent these in-situ
estimation and conﬁguration.

It is important to note that Part I is a one-time operation and
does not need to be repeated again as long as the ﬁlter ambient
temperature is kept the same as the ﬁlter pre-characterization
temperature. This is ensured by using the TEC setup seen in
Fig. 4. On the other hand, Part II algorithms are invoked each
time the ﬁlter is reconﬁgured or tuned to a different center
frequency (or wavelength).

A. Coupling Ratio (kn) Extraction

During the initial pre-characterization routine, Algorithm
1 is executed for each of the n rings in the ﬁlter. Here, to
be able to conﬁgure the desired coupling ratio (kn) of the
tunable coupler of the nth ring, the wavelength response of
the ring drop-port is recorded (using the monitor PDs) for
a range of coupler input voltages (vn,c). From this data, the
voltage (vn,cm) corresponding to the maximum coupling ra-
tio (kn,max) is recorded. The maximum coupling is identiﬁed
by observing the quality factor (Q) of the ring drop-port
resonance. Optical cavity dynamics dictate that as coupling
ratio approaches unity, ring Q decreases [29]. This provides the
basis for identifying the kn,max by observing the minimum
Q (as shown in the bottom-right inset of Fig. 5). On the
other hand, zero-coupling voltage (vn,c0) is identiﬁed simply
by ﬁnding the vn,c corresponding to lowest monitor output
at a ﬁxed λ ∈ Λ (any wavelength within one FSR in the
wavelength range of interest, i.e. Λ). This is possible due the
to very low optical power coming through the drop-port when
zero-coupling is in place (as shown in the top-left inset of
Fig. 5). Afterwards, the power (Pn,c) delivered to nth coupler
microheater at different vn,c is recorded using a Keysight
B2902A source measurement unit (SMU), and thus the Pn,c
vs vn,c characteristics are obtained. The SMU can also be
realized using on-board electronics for portability [30].

Utilizing this data rather

than simply relying on the
quadratic relationship between voltage and power [31] ensures
that the algorithm is insensitive to the electrical non-linearity
of on-chip microheaters. Subsequently,
the zero-coupling
power (Pn,c0) and max-coupling heater power (Pn,cm) are
obtained, and thus the power (Pn,cπ ) required to obtain a
π phase shift in the coupler microheaters is determined as
Pn,cπ = Pn,cm−Pn,c0. This Pn,cπ will subsequently serve as a
reference value for the tuning algorithm to operate at different
wavelengths within the FSR of the rings. It is important to
note that by utilizing zero and maximum coupling rather than
the critical coupling as in [7], we avoid repeated re-centering
of the ring resonance at the ﬁlter center frequency (λc) during
the kn extraction step. Also as mentioned earlier, use of an

OVNA is avoided by precluding the ring loss measurements
at critical coupling for each of the rings as in the prior art in
[7]. This considerably speeds up the kn extraction step in the
ﬁlter reconﬁguration algorithm (∼2X reduction in time) and
enables in-situ tuning that can be implemented using PCB-
level or chip-scale electronics.

the corresponding input power, P ∗

ﬁrst the Pn,c0 is recorded, and depending on the λc, this may
not be the same as the Pn,c0 seen in Algorithm 1. Then,
the raised-cosine coupling ratio vs power curve of the tunable
coupler [7] from Eq. 4 and illustrated in Fig. 5 is ﬁtted to the
(Pn,c0, 0) & (Pn,c0 + Pn,cπ , kn,max) data points. From this
ﬁtted curve, power (P ∗
n,c) required to set any desired coupling
ratio (kn) is estimated as shown in Fig. 5. Afterwards, from the
pre-characterization vn,c vs Pn,c data, the DAC voltage (v∗
n,c)
needed to set a desired kn is determined. Here, kn,max is the
maximum coupling coefﬁcient and due to the intrinsic loss in
the coupler, it never reaches unity. For our tunable coupler,
it is found to be 0.959 from the foundry PDK. Furthermore,
for the purpose of the ﬁlter and its usable frequency range
for a free-spectral range (FSR) of 31 GHz (or 0.249 nm), the
couplers can be considered broadband. Thus, all the extracted
parameters are usable at any frequency (or wavelength) within
the FSR.

B. Ring Phase (φn) Extraction

Now we describe the one-time pre-characterization routine
(i.e. Algorithm 3) for the ring phase bias. First, all the rings
except for the nth ring are detached from the ﬁlter by setting
their corresponding couplers to zero-coupling. This ensures
that
the cross-port of the ﬁlter only shows the resonance
response of the nth ring. Then, the voltage (vn,rπ ) required
for a π phase shift in the ring microheater was extracted
by monitoring the cross port of the ﬁlter and shifting the
resonance by full FSR (corresponding to 2π phase-shift in
the ring) for the applied voltage. Afterwards, the power (Pn,r)
delivered to nth ring heater at different vn,r is recorded using
the SMU and Pn,rπ is obtained. As mentioned before, utilizing
vn,r vs Pn,r data ensures that the algorithm is insensitive to
the process-dependent electrical nonlinearity of the on-chip
microheaters.

During the automatic calibration routine in Algorithm 4,
pre-characterized Pn,rπ , and vn,r vs Pn,r characteristics of the
ring microheater is utilized. Then, from the phase-shift desired
by the user, φn,
the required microheater power change,
∆Pn,r, is estimated using Eq. 9 as

∆Pn,r =

φnPn,rπ

(10)

Meanwhile,

the voltage (vn,res) for which the nth ring
resonance is aligned with λc is obtained by sweeping the ring
microheater voltage (vn,r) and ﬁnding the maximum drop port
response. From this data, the power (Pn,res) at which ring
resonance is aligned with λc is obtained. Then, the power
(P ∗
n,r) required to set the ring at desired φn is estimated as
P ∗
n,r = Pn,res+∆Pn,r and the corresponding ring microheater
voltage (v∗

n,r) is applied.

ﬁlter synthesis algorithm [20], [32], [33] translates these
user-deﬁned speciﬁcations (ﬁlter type, order, bandwidth, cen-
ter frequency, out-of-band suppression) to ﬁlter parameters
(kn, φn & φq,ps) for all rings and MZI arms. Then the
ccoeff(n, λc, kn) routine from Algorithm 2 is invoked and
desired coupling coefﬁcients for all ring couplers are conﬁg-
ured by setting the microheater voltages of the ring tunable
couplers to v∗
n,c. Next, the ringbias(n, λc, φn) routine from
Algorithm 4 is invoked to set all the ring biases (φn) with
respect to the λc at their desired values. It’s important to note
that due to thermal crosstalk between on-chip microheaters,
every time a ring phase (φn) is set, previously aligned rings
get de-tuned and several iterations are required accurately to
set all the φn values.

To improve the out-of-band rejection of the ﬁlter, we
maximize the 10% monitor tap placed at the cross-port of the
ﬁlter at λr by tuning the MZI quadrature-phase-shifter (Q-PS)
and the back-coupler (B-C). Here, λr is the wavelength where
a null in the ﬁlter response can be enforced.

However, the out-of-band-rejection calibration via Q-PS and
B-C microheaters shifts the resonance of the previously tuned
rings, thus altering the center wavelength (or frequency) of the
ﬁlter response. To perform center-wavelength correction, rings,
Q-PS and B-C are tuned subsequently and several iterations
of tuning (n rings, Q-PS and B-C) are needed to reach the
thermal steady-state of the PIC. When the required voltage
stimulus is stabilized within a tolerance range (indicating a
thermal steady-state), the ﬁlter tuning is complete.

It’s important to note that the coupling ratio of the tun-
able couplers are relatively stable in presence of thermal
perturbation. This is due to the fact that thermal perturbation
coming from other microheaters affect both microheaters of
the tunable couplers almost equally, thus inducing a ‘common-
mode’ phase shift that does not alter the coupling ratios which
only depends upon the differential phase (φD). Therefore, it is
not required to include ring coupler tuning inside the iteration
loop, which in turn speeds up the reconﬁguration process.
it precludes
Another key aspect of this algorithm is that
the use of ‘outer ring’ for out-of-band rejection in [7], thus
further reducing conﬁguration time for ‘outer ring’ resonance
alignment and also results in a smaller layout area.

band rejection, an insertion loss (IL) of 2.2 dB, and the
3dB bandwidth (BW) of 3 GHz at 1550nm wavelength. The
1550nm CW laser and input/outputs were coupled into the
PIC using a 4-channel polarization maintaining ﬁber array.
The ﬁber array was automatically aligned to the on-chip GCs.
the ﬁlter at
different stages of reconﬁguration is illustrated in Fig. 6.
The observed GC response exhibited ∼0.8dB ripple in the
passband response, and the passband GC losses were de-
embedded from the ﬁlter response. Unlike [7], here in this
work, as soon as the Q-PS and/or B-C microheater is tuned, the
previously locked UR & LR rings get de-tuned due to thermal
crosstalk and the center frequency of the ﬁlter shifts from its
intended λc (in this case, λc = 1550 nm) as demonstrated in
Fig. 6(d) and (e). Therefore, several iterations are required for
automatic tuning of the ﬁlter.

Since DACs set the microheater voltages (or power), the
convergence of the tuning algorithm can be observed in the
settling of the DAC output voltages. In Fig. 7, the transient
evolution of DAC voltages for all relevant microheaters during
the tuning process is presented. Fig. 7 also shows the laser
wavelength settings (λc and λr) that are applied to the ﬁlter
input. Key events that occur during the automatic tuning
process are labeled in Fig. 7 and explained in Table II. This
ﬁgure shows three iterations to tune the ﬁlter (rings, Q-PS & B-
C), and the time taken for the iteration progressively decreases
as the ﬁlter gets closer to the thermal steady-state during
tuning. In our ﬁlter layout, the Q-PS and B-C coupler were in
close proximity to the rings resulting in substantial thermal
crosstalk. The fabricated 2nd-order ﬁlter takes around 725

seconds to tune for the ﬁrst time. The long conﬁguration times
are primarily determined by the thermal crosstalk between the
components and can be signiﬁcantly reduced by spreading out
the layout and by employing microheaters with undercut for
thermal isolation [34], [35].

DAC sampling and laser wavelength switching at different stages of silicon photonic ﬁlter reconﬁguration. The corresponding timestamps are explained
in detail in Table II. Each iteration corresponds to ring phase, quadrature phase-shifter and back-coupler conﬁguration steps. Here, three iterations were needed
as the thermal crosstalk from the last back-coupler and quadrature phase-shifter conﬁguration step de-tunes the rings.

strate such capability, we reconﬁgured the ﬁlter at 5 different
center frequencies (λc) with 0.05nm (∼6.25 GHz) spacing as
shown in Fig. 8 (top). It’s important to note that the center
frequency tuning is continuous and any center wavelength (λc)
can be conﬁgured as long as it is within the FSR of the rings.
This means that the fabricated ﬁlter can be reconﬁgured at
any frequency between DC and 31 GHz. To cover higher
frequency bands, the ﬁlter can be redesigned with smaller
rings (i.e. larger FSR). On the other hand, the bandwidth
(BW) tunability of our proposed ﬁlter is shown in Fig. 8
(bottom) for BW = 2.68, 3 and 3.69 GHz. A trade-off can be
observed in Fig. 8 (bottom), whereby as the BW is reduced,
the passband insertion loss increases [13]. This becomes even
more prominent when sub-GHz 3dB bandwidth settings are
attempted. This is due to the losses in the rings, and can be
mitigated by adopting low-loss multimode waveguide design
[36] and/or utilizing the upcoming ultra low-loss PDK from
AIM Photonics [21].

order APD ﬁlter [7], 5th-order CROW ﬁlter [10], 2nd-order

matrix based ﬁlter [37], ﬁlter based on phase-to-intensity

presents a ﬁrst fully-automatic ﬁlter tuning scheme with in-
situ reconﬁguration capability and a signiﬁcant step towards a
portable solution.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This work presented a robust silicon photonic ﬁlter for
RF photonic applications with an improved reconﬁguration
algorithm that is insensitive to PVT variations. By utilizing
proposed in-situ conﬁguration algorithm with simpler pre-
characterization steps (i.e. without requiring an OVNA), we
have experimentally shown that the ﬁlter can be conﬁgured
to any desired center frequency, bandwidth and rejection as

per the user speciﬁcations with high ﬁdelity. Moreover, the
ﬁlter is a ﬁrst of its class to be fabricated in AIM photonics’s
CMOS compatible Active Photonic process, making the ﬁlter
widely manufacturable at low cost for next-generation RF
photonic systems. The proposed coupling coefﬁcient extraction
and conﬁguration algorithm provides upto 2X improvement in
conﬁguration time over the prior art.

Further improvements such as sub-GHz bandwidth with low
insertion loss can potentially be achieved by incorporating
multimode & low-loss waveguide designs [36] and <1%
monitor taps in the rings, and/or leveraging the planned ultra-
low-loss PDK and MPW runs from AIM Photonics [21].
The current 2nd-order ﬁlter initial reconﬁguration time is
around 725s. With our optimized algorithm and a low thermal
crosstalk design where back-coupler and quadrature phase
shifter tuning does not affect the ring bias (φn) as in [7], the
ﬁlter reconﬁguration time can be as fast as ∼300s. This can be
achieved by careful planning of PIC layout where the thermo-
optic phase-shifters (microheaters) are placed further apart
from sensitive waveguides (rings) at the expense of a larger
footprint. Achieving rapid ﬁlter reconﬁguration on the order
of seconds in frequency-agile SDRs will require even higher
thermal isolation between on-chip photonic components. This
can potentially be achieved by integration of microheaters with
undercut [35] in the SiP foundry process. In summary, by
taking full advantage of the large-volume low-cost manufac-
turing of a CMOS-compatible photonic process, the presented
RF photonic ﬁlters and improved reconﬁguration algorithm
provide a way forward for wider adoption in high-performance
RF and microwave photonic transceivers.
