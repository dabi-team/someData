Abstract— The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled a wide 
range of sectors to interact effectively with their consumers in 
order  to  deliver  seamless  services  and  products.  Despite  the 
widespread  availability  of  (IoT)  devices  and  their  Internet 
connectivity,  they  have  a  low  level  of  information  security 
integrity.  A  number  of  security  methods  were  proposed  and 
evaluated in our research, and comparisons were made in terms 
of energy and time in the encryption and decryption processes. 
A ratification procedure is also performed on the devices in the 
main  manager,  which  is  regarded  as  a  full  firewall  for  IoT 
devices.  The  suggested  algorithm's  success  has  been  shown 
utilizing  low-cost  Adriano  Uno  and  Raspberry  Pi  devices. 
Arduous  Uno  has  been  used  to  demonstrate  the  encryption 
process  in  low-energy  devices  using  a  variety  of  algorithms, 
including  Enhanced  Algorithm 
for  Data  Integrity  and 
Authentication (EDAI) and raspberry, which serves as a safety 
manager in low-energy device molecules. A variety of enhanced 
algorithms used in conjunction with Blockchain software have 
also assured the security and integrity of the information. These 
findings and discussions are presented at the conclusion of the 
paper.

INTRODUCTION 

In  today's  digital  era,  the  usage  of  the  internet  of  things 
(IoT)  in  our  lives  is  quickly  expanding,  for  example,  for 
practical  and  industrial  applications.  As  more  people  utilize 
the  internet  of  things  (IoT)  in  research  domains,  (IoT)  has 
attracted  a  lot  of  attention  in  order  to  give  a  simple  and 
pleasant usage in everyday life [1, 2]. The Internet of Things 
(IoT) is described as a network that can process information 
by using sensors that are connected to the internet and can be 
directly  linked  to  many  devices  over  the  internet.  These 
devices are mainly reliant on their low cost. As a result, we 
may conclude that the actual growth factor of the Internet of 
Things is its low cost [3, 4, 5, 6]. Many people all around the 
world are interested in the (IoT) and are eager to gain access 
to  sensor  devices  [7,  8].  It  is  worth  noting  that  we  require 
information  security  as  well  as  data  protection  and  that  all 
devices  connected  to  the  internet  should  be  more  strict  and 
powerful [9, 10]. The Internet of Things is linked to physical 
components or devices to provide real-time data to the Internet 
of Things data  platforms,  which  will  evaluate,  comprehend, 
and offer real-time choices based on the rules created [11, 12]. 
Today's  computer  devices  that  are connected to  the  internet 

require assurances against the worries and breaches that may 
threaten data privacy, data hacking, and information security 
in the platforms and devices of the Internet (IoT) To offer a 
strong security communication method and a secure platform, 
it is necessary to organize information security controls and 
data encryption standards for each update cycle [13, 14, 15]. 

The usage of the internet is rapidly expanding, including 
smart  homes,  refrigerator  temperature  management,  air 
conditioning,  door  locks,  and  other  connected  devices  with 
sensors, regardless of whether they are permanently linked to 
the internet or receive data in real-time via sensors. According 
to  estimates,  the  number  of  Internet-connected  devices  will 
reach 50 billion by the end of 2020/2021, and it is obvious that 
this number is rapidly rising [16, 17]. Given the popularity of 
the Internet of Things, a variety of suitable security measures 
in  the  internet  of  things  devices  are  required  to  provide 
information security, data protection, and fraud detection. As 
a result, these devices  may  be  utilized  more  effectively  and 
safely [18, 19, 20]. One of the goals of this study is to protect 
privacy in all of its manifestations. 

The rest of the paper contains the follows, the first section 
presents an introduction about the internet of things (IoT), the 
second  section  talks  about  the  security  threats  that  face  the 
system of the internet of video things, the third section talks 
about  IoT  and  blockchain  encryption  algorithms,  the  fourth 
section talks about  improving  the design  of IoT  algorithms, 
the  next  section  talks  about  encryption  process,  the  sixth 
section talks about evaluation and results, and the last section 
is the conclusion and future work. Then the references. 

II.  SECURITY THREATS OF THE INTERNET OF  
THINGS 

To  fully  integrate  the  industrial and  societal  sectors into 
the  Internet  of  Things  applications,  many  assurances  and 
controls that improve information security and control privacy 
controls are required; otherwise, there will be a threat to data 
integrity  due  to  easy  access  to  physical  objects  that  are  not 
subject to supervision. This danger is regarded as the primary 
cause  of  security  threats  to  Internet  of  Things  applications, 
which are likely to affect the industry and the economy; it is 
also anticipated to raise worries about privacy breaches [21, 
22, 23, 24].  

The  IoT  devices  are  more  vulnerable  to  security  threats 
since their physical devices are tiny and are not subject to any 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the previously stated supervisory mechanisms [25, 26]. As 
a result, controlling these devices as well as the external world 
surrounding  them  becomes  challenging  [27,  28].  Low-cost 
energy  sources  typically  power  IoT  devices.  This  reason 
enables  hackers  to  destroy  any  actual  or  tangible  item 
connected  to  the  Internet  of  Things  via  wireless  media.  An 
effective algorithm is developed to ensure that nothing from 
the device is leaked [29, 30]. 

It  is  possible  that  the algorithms  currently  in  use  do  not 
provide the appropriate efficiency due to constraints imposed 
on computational resources and energy requirements because 
IoT devices have a small capacity while the energy used must 
be  large  to  save  the  power  of  the  algorithm  as  the  large 
algorithm  requires  a  large  amount  of  energy  that  is  greater 
than the energy available in IoT devices [31, 32]. 

The main structure of any IoT device includes two main 

tiers: 

1)  Adequate  data  for  the  device  is  acquired  when  the 

sensor devices are connected. 

2)  The  presentation  tier:  This  tier  is  in  charge  of 
displaying the findings to the customer or Internet-connected 
devices. 

The components of the Internet of Things devices include 
a variety of optical sensors, devices for measuring temperature 
and humidity, devices for monitoring the proximity of sound 
and flow of chemicals, and other components that continually 
and actively monitor the environment [33, 34]. Although IoT 
devices  have  computing  capability,  they  are  incapable  of 
processing  huge  amounts  of  data  or  activities.  As  a  result, 
extra layers are required to deal with the data received from 
real devices [35]. 

Every  IoT device  has  many  tiers  for  sensing  the  needed 
data and delivering it from one device to another via one of 
the  recorded  tiers  in  a  device-consistent  manner.  Extensible 
Markup  Language  (XML),  JavaScript  Object  Notation 
(JSON), and  separator  formats  are often  used. The received 
information  is  encrypted  utilizing  Algorithms,  which  assure 
data confidentiality and protection from any compromise [36]. 

The most important function of data confidentiality in any 
system is linking consumer data in real-time [37]. Because the 
devices linked to the internet have tiny Peripheral devices, the 
data is encrypted and hidden from hackers to create a secure 
connecting  channel.  A  comprehensive  adaption  is  produced 
for  sharing  data  to  maintain  privacy.  They  might  go 
unmonitored for days or weeks [38]. This situation puts them 
at risk of data theft and assaults. As a consequence, hackers 
can  access  the  device's  main  memory  and  extract  data.  To 
avoid  this,  it  is  critical  to  use  robust  data  encryption  and 
expand the encryption keys' work to become extremely secure 
and cannot be readily recovered [36].  

This  provides  a  starting  point  for  protecting  Internet  of 
Things  devices  from  network  threats  and  ensuring  data 
integrity.  Many  suggested  algorithms,  such  as  Advanced 
Encryption  Standard  (AES),  LEA,  and  RC6,  have  been 
developed  and  deployed  in  IoT  devices.  However,  because 
IoT devices are limited to a particular and basic power, less 
processing power is acquired. Thus we are striving to develop 
a 
[39,  40].  The 
communication  channel  between  IoT  devices  and  IoT 
platforms should be secure and unaffected by any threat [41].  

large  algorithm  with 

few  cycles 

Because of the growth in threats on the internet of video 
things, which exceeded two thirds, there is a constant need to 
enhance the algorithm and examine the data. According to the 
Sonic Wall study for IoT attacks on the internet over 2019- 
2020  at  rates  surpassing  66  percent.  In  2020  [42,  43],  the 
number of attacks grew substantially from 34.3 to 56.9 million 
attacks. Attacks on the Internet are often classified as a binary 
attack in the middle of a physical attack, seizing the device's 
memory,  or  breaking  the  Internet  connection  lines  [44,  45]. 
Data encryption aids in the transport and conversion of plain 
texts into encrypted texts, therefore minimizing the potential 
of data theft. In any case, there is a considerable reduction in 
the  performance  of  the  present  algorithms,  and  they  cannot 
fulfil the requirements of low-power IoT gadgets [46]. As a 
result, improved techniques for protecting tools and devices 
against  known  threats  and  data  from  hackers  must  be 
developed [47, 48].  

Many  algorithms  for  the  Internet  of  Things  have  been 
proposed. A new structure was also proposed to connect IoT 
devices  using  high  computing  and  blockchain  technology, 
which is an improved algorithm that depends on the speed of 
encryption  and  the  connection  to  the  headquarters  that  is 
responsible for protecting the internet of things from attacks 
and  illegal  entries  by  breaking  data  into  blocks  using  the 
Blockchain  algorithm.  In  this  work,  we  explore  improved 
algorithms  for  IoT  devices  that  are  less  powerful  and  have 
weak  computing  capabilities.  These  features  allow  us  to 
contact  the building's  security  management  and request  that 
IoT  devices  and  tools  be  installed.  A  new  structure  is  also 
offered  to  introduce  the  Blockchain  in  Node  Manager  to 
handle  data  integrity  and  IoT  device  integrity  inside  the 
network [49].

IOT AND BLOCKCHAIN ENCRYPTION 

ALGORITHMS 

correlation 

According to the sufficient explanation, it is vital to spot 
the  shortcomings  of  the  algorithms  in  various  low-powered 
devices  with  limited  resources.  As  a  result,  if  any  network 
node is targeted [50] and then controlled, the entire internet of 
things becomes vulnerable to a wide range of other attacks. To 
that  aim,  we  propose  considering  blocked  zeros  as  viable 
possibilities for activating restricted devices via secure media. 
According  to  the  block  chain  algorithm,  crypto-analysis 
assaults, such as linear and differential techniques, are one of 
the difficult ways in Feistel encryption. They can use S-Box 
functional 
and  4-bit 
layers, 
propagation. All characteristics are defined by the plain text 
of a 64-bit long entry, the 48-bit encryption key, and the block 
size of 64 bits, 80 bits, and 128 bits. Long keys are what they're 
called.  When  the  round  key  is  pushed,  the  preset  algorithm 
begins the process of encoding substitution or flipping blocks. 
Because  the  Feistel  structure  allows  for  various  device 
groupings, as advocated by the National Security Inspectorate 
(NSI),  Simon's  technique  is  the  best  device  implementation 
method. The letters a and A2 are widely used to signify block 
size  and  key  length,  respectively.  The  SIMON  algorithm 
allows  for  a  maximum  block size  of 128 bits. It is a  strong 
alternative to (AES) encryption since it is versatile enough to 
be used in any IoT board and device without interfering with 
the devices. 

confusion, 

The (LILLIPUT) [51] technique employs improved block 
encryption  with  a  block  size  of  64  bits  and  an  80-bit  key 
length. As a result, it is created in an S-Box style similar to 
Present.  [52]  The  SB  network  is  the  basis  for  KLIN  block 

encryption.  It provides  64-bit blocks. The  length  of  the  key 
can  range  between 64 and 96 bits. Both  messages  and  hash 
values are authenticated. The exchange value of this key is not 
static,  and  the  keys  were  previously  switched  dynamically 
with  a  set  of  specified  values.  RC5,  Tiny  Encryption 
Algorithm (TEA), and other algorithms have been proved to 
be effective in Block Cipher (XXTEA) [53]. These algorithms 
require  higher processing power.  As  a result,  increasing the 
cycles and regularly changing the key for the specified device 
can result in the initial key recovery. A survey was undertaken 
to  discover  that  various  algorithms  give  an  effective  and 
secure  method  of  protecting  plain  text  while  linking  the 
particles of the internet of things. However, when it comes to 
data  integrity,  the  algorithms  fall  short  of  providing  the 
essential  safeguards.  [54]  As  a  result,  it  is  suggested  that  a 
smooth,  lightweight  sequence  of  the blocks  used  in  the  IoT 
environment  be  implemented  to  protect  the  integrity  of  the 
data provided  in  each portion  and  every  new  connection on 
IoT  platforms.  [55]  A  group  proposed  a  research  paper  in 
which the particles of the Internet of Things were organized 
into  a  special  network  in  which  the  high  computing  device 
would work within the node, provide authentication and direct 
packages if there are a large number of movements within the 
network.  It  could  be  decoded  in  an  indexed  form  in  the 
blockchain  within  the  hardware  of  smart  devices  already 
present at homes. A researcher named LIE [56] described the 
structure of the blockchain feature for vehicle communication. 
He added that whenever the vehicle moves to a new zone, the 
heterogeneous blockchain group receives a detailed message 
about the vehicle and its main information. In addition to the 
major  information  about  these  cars,  this  subject  provides 
additional 
them  for  organizers  or 
communities  interested  in  tracking  vehicles  and  collecting 
data  about  them  by  recognizing  the  movement  of  these 
vehicles in real-time. This understanding reduces the need for 
encryption  when  sending  and  receiving  data  over  mobile 
phone  networks.  It  also  takes  into  account  current  security 
concerns concerning traditional data transfer protocols.

IV.  IMPROVING THE DESIGN OF IOT ALGORITHMS: 

Table 1 shows how the enhanced (EDAI) algorithm is used 
for  authentication  and  data  integrity  for  IoT  devices  using 
widely  used  substitution-permutation  networks  (SPNs)  and 
the  Festal  encoding  method  [57].  This  method  functions 
dynamically,  merging  the  features  of  the  Language  Server 
Protocol  (LSP)  and  VESTL  into  a  single  form  to  boost  the 
security  of  IoT  particles  in  fewer  encryption  rounds  than 
currently available techniques. The encryption rounds range 
from 20 to 64 [58], depending on the key size. Because IoT 
particles  have  limited  energy  and  resources,  reducing 
encryption  frequency  to  a  bare  minimum  and  establishing 
more  complicated  keys  ensures  better  production  and 
extraction  of  a  coded  text  in  a  regulated  environment.  The 
following is a list of IoT devices that are regularly used.

The use of the Feistel cypher via the SP network and the 
AES method has the advantage of reducing the complications 

that develop during the encryption and decryption operations 
on distinct  works. [59]  From  another perspective, there is  a 
related  technique  for  generating  cypher  text  (CT)  and  then 
converting it back to plain text (PT). The (EDIA) technique 
encodes a defined segment of asymmetric 64-bit key particles, 
where  each  key  and  text  are  the  same  size  and  encoded  an 
agreed-upon  number  of  times,  denoted  by  n.  Encryption  is 
achieved  by  combining  keys  and  bits  in  order  to  achieve 
optimum  results.  It  is  recommended  that  five  rounds  of 
encryption  be  used  with  a  16-bit  key  length  instead  of  the 
original key's 64 bits. To stop the attacks in the main search 
phase, a  number of repetitions  must  be  created  to  make  the 
used key more difficult [60].

This  sequential  format  is  produced  based  on  a  prior 
sequence. Take a look at the data in Table 2. The checksum 
logic is determined for each Internet-of-Things object or tool 
as  a  result  of  the  checksum  calculated  from  the  current 
timestamp and firmware ID in such a way that only the sender 
and  the  receiver  maintain  it.  If  any  communication  error 
occurs  during  optional  assembler  creation  of  the  key  or 
timestamp, it will lead to a mismatch in the algorithm's key.

The 64-bit  keys'  outputs  are  not  simple  text or  a  default 
key  provided  by  the  Internet  of  Things  device,  but  rather  a 
series of  functions  that  allow  higher complexity  to  generate 
and expand the key. To ensure the key's complexity, we work 
on  four primary  values  with  special  logic  to build  a two-bit 
audit. [61].  

 Master schedule - time expansion:  

The EDIA algorithm is a key generation algorithm that is 
used in mathematical functions. It generates four circular keys 
of 16 bits each. Each key is utilized in cypher rounds. It can 
also  be  used  with  a  subkey.  The  substitution  and  switching 
approach  is  used  while  entering  the  plain  text  in  order  to 
receive the encrypted text at the end of the encryption process. 
In most cases, the tour is solely accountable for everything, 
like as hacking or transmitting unencrypted text. 

The  method  used  is  the  one  that  agrees  on  the  primary 
inputs  from  the  source  text  sector,  and  it  includes  the  Bit 
Randomize property:  

It is the one who creates the master key and ensures the 
key's  complexity  while  also  preventing  attackers  from 
obtaining the primary key or subkey, as shown in fig 1 [61].

Normally, the C - D function produces four 4 * 4 matrices. 

Skm1–Skm2–Skm3–Skm4–Skm5–Skm6–Skm7–Skm8–
Skm9 The matrices are based on the C and D conversion and 
are  supplemented  with  bit  combinations  that  result  in  four 
keys (Kr) [63].  

Creating Master Keys: It collects 4 * Kr and performs an 
XOR operation on its output. It includes the second half of the 
total  that  was  tested  and  displayed  when  the  first  key  was 
generated. Figure 2 shows how to add a third master key to 
complicate the encryption and decryption operations further.  

Fig. 2.  Encryption With XOR Process [36] 

V.  ENCRYPTION PROCESS 

The initial procedure Feistel uses the same processes and 
rounds for encryption and decryption, as shown in the diagram 
below, and it works with 16-bit data in four blocks for a total 
of 64 bits. Each of the 16 blocks of plain text (Pt) and cypher 
text is encrypted at the end of each round (Ct). The (EDIA) 
technique uses a five-point encryption strategy, with each 16-
bit combination serving as an input and the bits being changed 
regularly to increase the security and complexity of the coding 
text. K1-5 is an expansion product that is frequently used in 
any round. In addition to the XNOR technique, C-D and the 
diffusion  function  are  employed  to  overlap  texts  if  they  are 
available.  

The  C-D  function  is  used  to  transfer  LO  and  R0,  after 
which the C and D transformations are applied, and the final 
values are as follows: 

Fig. 1.  Key Expansions Process [61] 

The main objective of Bit Randomize is to assign bits at 
random from the master key to its subkeys (6 * 14 bit) (Sk1, 
Sk2, Sk3, Sk4). Each key is a four-by-four bit combination of 
the generated key. Based on the first piece of information, this 
is the case. Checksum As illustrated in table 3, a 64-bit key is 
divided into a 16-bit intermediate key.

As shown in Table 4, the C-D function is a function that 
uses  jamming  and  propagation  to  switch  bits  using  tables. 
These tables combine the predefined bits, which are employed 
in two more tables, C and D.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ct = Lr1 + Rr1 + Lr2 + Rr2  ………. (2) 

The  process  for  exchanging  keys  both  enhances  and 
complicates  the  cipher  script.  Furthermore,  as  previously 
stated,  the  master  key  function  works  on  the  embedding 
process via checksum as an additional security component to 
reduce attacks on the master texts. 

- A simple blockchain for the Internet of Things: 

The  blockchain  uses  records  to  protect  data  distribution 
and  storage.  A  complex  computing  process  performs  the 
combination  by  distributing  the  data.  As  a  result,  attackers 
cannot obtain any form of data or hack the data available on 
any  network  because  all  of  the  remaining  nodes  will  not 
respond  to  the  responses,  resulting  in  inconsistent  data,  as 
shown in fig 3 [36].

The authentication of the Internet of Things is a sign and 
one of the most important acts stated in the authentication tool 
sequence. The table below represents a complex and difficult-
to-solve  authentication  challenge.  Because  all  particles  are 
semi-connected and in private networks, direct connections to 
public networks are limited in a simple approach that assures 
data  and  particle  integrity.  Despite  increased  pressure,  data 
protection and privacy can be provided by using an additional 
device, regardless of material costs [64]. 

If the code to be encrypted is: 8787878787878787  And 
my DES Key specified is: 0E329232EA6D0D73, we can get 

the  ciphertext  is:  0000000000000000.  if  the  same  DES  key 
were  used  for  the  above  cypher  text  0E329232EA6D0D73, 
the original text 87878787878787 would be the result of the 
decoding.  

Examples are employed in this scenario because the plain 
text is 64 bits long, and the blain text can also be 64 bits long. 
However, in most circumstances, plain text is not a 64-bit (16-
hexadecimal digit) integer multiplication. 

This language computer code was used in the context of 

encryption using the DES and AES algorithms. 

VI.  EVALUATION AND RESULT  

implementation 

Many  important  elements  must  be  considered  while 
evaluating  the  (EDIA)  algorithm  in  (IoT)  devices,  such  as 
time,  maximum  energy 
resource  use, 
utilization,  and  key  complexity.  Aside  from  the  encryption 
and  decryption  operations,  the  sensitivity  of  the  key  to  the 
input process is controlled by a sufficient number of employed 
rounds. To examine  all data, a comparison  is done  between 
the  algorithm  used  and  the  previously  reviewed  algorithms 
and gives the most accurate results. From this vantage point, 
we  work  our  way  through  the  memory  available  for  the 
method to do various arithmetic operations on plain text. If the 
memory usage is high, the Internet of Things device will be 
unable to keep the memory as the number of rounds increases. 
As  a  result,  because  memory  is  one  of  the  most  important 
things, we must use it optimally. Any IoT device's power is 
limited in the middle of the rounds, as is the time it takes to 
generate plain text for encoding and decoding. 

Furthermore,  it  restricts  other  functions  of  devices  with 
limited energy. Here is where the assessment algorithm comes 
into  play  for  the  required  suitability  in  terms  of  energy  and 
required  functionalities.  Provides  a  method  of  attack  the 
search key is the attacker's ability to obtain the key and change 
the  encryption  text.  The  sensitivity  to  the  fake  key  must 
typically be high enough that retrievers are unable to recover 
the  original  content.  The  algorithm's  performance  is  often 
measured  using  the  AT  Mega  328  Adriano  board  software, 
which attempts to conserve energy while accepting data from 
an  external  source.  The  time  spent  implementing  the 
encryption is typically 0.195 decoding is 0.190 milliseconds. 
The algorithm's memory, which is 30 bytes, is used to generate 
texts  for  people  who  want  to  encode  them,  and  the 
comparisons with algorithms are presented below:

The energy consumption is computed based on a number 
of  criteria,  including  the  number  of  encoding  and  decoding 
cycles,  and  it  is  close  to  160.24  micro  joules.  Total 
transmission cycles have roughly 1800 micro joules. As the 
complexities  of  the  encryption  and  decryption  key  are 
regularly enhanced, the information appears to be the better 
usage that can be used for any device, IoT device, or tool. 

 
 
 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 

This  work  presented  and  provided  integration  between 
data  and  security  via  a  lightweight  (SPN)  and  Feistel 
algorithms  combined  through  5  rounds  of  encryption  and 
decryption procedures on Adriano systems. Security analyses 
yielded positive results. Raspberry Pi Nodal Manager devices 
limited  energy  and 
safeguard  Adriano  particles  with 
resources. They  ensure particle integration  in IoT networks, 
which  consume  the  speed  of  encryption  and  data  block 
ratification. We achieved good results by reducing the number 
of attacks and modifying particles and their penetration with 
lightweight algorithms and virtually during confirmation.  

We  can  improve  internet  of  things  (IoT)  devices  by 
increasing  access  to  random  memory  (ROM)  and  random 
access  memory  (RAM)  in  many  used  devices  with  limited 
resources and applying the same things to high-end devices in 
terms  of  energy  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  using  such  an 
approach  in  regular  devices  in  homes,  smart  factories,  and 
smart logistics.
