EXPLICIT COMPUTATIONS WITH CUBIC FOURFOLDS,
GUSHEL–MUKAI FOURFOLDS, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED K3
SURFACES

GIOVANNI STAGLIAN `O

Abstract. We present some applications of the Macaulay2 software package SpecialFanoFourfolds ,
a package for working with Hodge-special cubic fourfolds and Hodge-special Gushel–
Mukai fourfolds. In particular, we show how to construct new examples of such four-
folds, some of which turn out to be rational. We also describe how to calculate K3
surfaces associated with cubic or Gushel-Mukai fourfolds, which relies on an explicit
unirationality of some moduli spaces of K3 surfaces.

Introduction

One of the aims of this note is to show how some computations with cubic four-
folds and Gushel–Mukai fourfolds, which may appear very abstract, can be done in
an explicit and completely automatic way. For this purpose, we will use the package
SpecialFanoFourfolds [Sta22], which is included with Macaulay2 [GS21] (1). This package
implements several functions to construct and analyze such fourfolds, revolving around
questions of rationality. Most of the ideas on which these functions are based came from
the papers [RS19, RS21b]; other references are [BRS19, HS20, HS21a, ABS21, Sta21b].
For the general theory on cubic and Gushel–Mukai fourfolds, we mainly refer to [Has99,
Has00, DIM15].

Recall that cubic fourfolds and Gushel–Mukai fourfolds are prime Fano fourfolds of
index 3 and 2, respectively. By the work of Kobayashi and Ochiai [KO73], Iskovskikh
and Fujita [Fuj90], and Mukai [Muk89], prime Fano fourfolds of index ≥ 2 are completely
classiﬁed. We summarize in Table 1 this classiﬁcation. For most of the known types of
prime Fano fourfolds, there are classical constructions to produce rational parameteriza-
tions of the general fourfold. It is also classically known that some special cubic fourfolds
and some special Gushel–Mukai fourfolds are rational (see [Mor40, Fan43, Rot49]). How-
ever, the question whether the general cubic fourfold (resp., the general Gushel–Mukai
fourfold) is rational or not is still unsolved. It is expected that inside the moduli space
of cubic fourfolds (resp., Gushel–Mukai fourfolds), the rational fourfolds should belong
to the so-called Noether–Lefschetz locus, which is a countable union of hypersurfaces;
in particular, the very general fourfold should be irrational. Roughly speaking, the
Noether–Lefschetz locus parametrizes fourfolds containing a surface whose cohomology
class does not come from the ambient space (P5 for cubic fourfolds, and G(1, 4) ⊂ P9 for
Gushel–Mukai fourfolds).

Table 1. Prime Fano fourfolds of index ≥ 2. The classical constructions
of rationality in [Rot49] are implemented in the function parametrize.

One of the useful features of the package is the ability to ﬁnd somewhat random ex-
amples of fourfolds in the Noether–Lefschetz locus and determine to which component
they belong. In some likely cases, from an automatic count of parameters performed
on the example, it is possible to get information about the Kodaira dimension of the
component. This has already been used in [Sta21b] to deduce that the ﬁrst ten com-
ponents of the Noether–Lefschetz locus in the moduli space of Gushel–Mukai fourfolds
have negative Kodaira dimension. In Theorem 1.7 we will extend this result by including
the eleventh component. See also Theorem 1.2 for known analogous results in the case
of cubic fourfolds.

A second feature of the package is the ability to establish the rationality of many
fourfolds and calculate rational parameterizations. This is based on ideas introduced
in [RS19]. We will use this feature to show new examples of rational Gushel–Mukai
fourfolds, thus continuing the research initiated in [Rot49] and continued in [DIM15,
RS21a, HS20, Sta21c]. See Tables 8 and 9 for a summary of new and old examples of
rational Gushel–Mukai fourfolds; see also Table 7 for the case of cubic fourfolds.

The last and most complex feature of the package is the possibility of calculating K3
surfaces “associated” with cubic or Gushel–Mukai fourfolds (see Subsections 1.7). This is
based on ideas developed in [RS21b] and then applied also in [HS21a]. As a consequence
of the construction, one deduces the (explicit) unirationality of some moduli space Fg
of K3 surfaces of genus g (see Theorem 2.7). Just to give an example of application,
the package can give us the explicit equations of general K3 surfaces of genus 22 (see
Code Example 2.14) and, if we had enough computing power, we could produce an
explicit dominant rational map from a projective space to the moduli space F22. The
unirationality of F22 has recently also been proved by Farkas and Verra [FV21], but their
construction seems too abstract to be translated into codes.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 1, we recall general facts on the Noether–
Lefschetz loci in the moduli spaces of cubic and Gushel–Mukai fourfolds. We also recall
the known results about the Kodaira dimension of the irreducible components of these
loci. Next we show how to construct new fourfolds. As an application, we deduce
Theorem 1.7, extending the main result obtained in [Sta21b]. Moreover, we construct
new examples of rational Gushel–Mukai fourfolds. In Section 2, we ﬁrst recall the known
results about the Kodaira dimension of the moduli spaces Fg of K3 surfaces of genus g.
Then we recall the constructions from [RS21b, HS21a] of the explicit unirationality of
Fg, for g = 11, 14, 20, 22, and show how to get equations for general K3 surfaces of these
genera.

1. Noether–Lefschetz loci in the moduli spaces of cubic fourfolds and

Gushel–Mukai fourfolds

1.1. Notation and deﬁnitions. A cubic fourfold is a smooth cubic hypersurface in
P5. Cubic fourfolds are parametrized by a moduli space C of dimension 20.

A Gushel–Mukai fourfold (GM fourfold for short) is a smooth quadric hypersurface in
\G(1, 4) ⊂ P10 over the Grassmannian
a 5-dimensional linear section Y5 ⊂ P8 of the cone
G(1, 4) ⊂ P9. GM fourfolds are parametrized by a moduli space GM of dimension 24.
\G(1, 4) are called
The GM fourfolds X ⊂ Y5 for which Y5 contains the vertex of the cone
of Gushel type and describe an irreducible codimension 2 closed subset of GM. The GM
fourfolds which are not of Gushel type are called ordinary. These can be realized as
smooth quadric hypersurfaces in a smooth Del Pezzo ﬁvefold P8 ∩ G(1, 4) ⊂ P9.

The Noether–Lefschetz locus in the moduli space of cubic fourfolds has been studied
by Hassett (see [Has99], see also [Has00, Has16]). It is a countable union of irreducible
hypersurfaces

Cd ⊂ C,

1.2. Formulas for the discriminant. We provide some details on the calculation of
the discriminant of a Hodge-special fourfold; see also [Has00, Section 4] and [DIM15,
Section 7].

Let [X] ∈ C be a cubic fourfold containing an irreducible surface S ⊂ P5 of degree
deg(S) and sectional genus g(S), which has smooth normalization and only a ﬁnite
number δ of nodes as singularities. Then one computes (see [Ful84, Theorem 9.3]) that
the self-intersection of S in X is given by

X = 3 deg(S) + 6 g(S) − 12 χ(OS ) + 2 K 2

1.3. Implementation. In the Macaulay2 package SpecialFanoFourfolds , Hodge-special
fourfolds are implemented as subtypes of the class “embedded projective variety”,
provided by the package MultiprojectiveVarieties [Sta21a]. However, a Hodge-special
fourfold is represented internally by a pair (S, X), where X is the fourfold and S is a
special hidden surface contained in X. The command surface(X) returns this surface
S. Hodge-special fourfolds can be created by the two functions: specialCubicFourfold
and specialGushelMukaiFourfold, which typically expect the pair (S, X) as input and
always return X. It is also possible to give only the surface S embedded in P5 or in
a ﬁvefold Y5, so that Macaulay2 will randomly choose a fourfold X containing S. In

the case when X is a GM fourfold given as a subvariety of P8, the Gushel map of X
is calculated behind the scenes and can be retrieved with the command toGrass(X).
The function discriminant, as its name suggests, calculates the discriminant of the
fourfold. This is done by applying the formulas (1.1), (1.2), (1.3), and (1.4), where
the value of K 2
S is determined by functions from the packages Cremona [Sta18] and
CharacteristicClasses [Jos15], and the normalization of S via the package IntegralClosure

maps. For this, functions from the package RationalMaps [BHSS22] are also used.

Code Example 1.1. In the following code, we create a GM fourfold containing a τ -
quadric surface, that is, a two-dimensional linear section of a Schubert variety Σ1,1 ≃
G(1, 3) ⊂ G(1, 4) (ﬁrst row of Table 8). We input the equations in the ring of polynomials
with 9 variables a, b, . . . , i. Note that by default, several checks are done on the input
data; these can be relaxed or strengthened using the option InputCheck.

1.4. Kodaira dimension of the components. We recall known results about the
Kodaira dimension of the components of the Noether–Lefschetz loci in the moduli spaces
C and GM. The ﬁrst result in this direction has been obtained in [Nue15], by showing
the following theorem with the exception of d = 42.

Theorem 1.2 ([Nue15, Lai17, FV21]). Each irreducible component Cd of the Noether–
Lefschetz locus in C is unirational if the discriminant d is at most 44.

On the other side we have the following.

Theorem 1.3 ([TVA19]).

6

G. STAGLIAN `O

• The component Cd is of general type for any d ≥ 114, with the possible exceptions

d ∈ {120, 122, 128, 132, 138, 150, 152, 180, 192}.

• The Kodaira dimension κ(Cd) is non-negative for any d ≥ 86, with the possible

exceptions d ∈ {90, 92, 96, 108, 120, 132, 180}.

In the case of GM fourfolds we have the following weaker results.

Theorem 1.4 ([Sta21b]). Each irreducible component of the Noether–Lefschetz locus in
GM is uniruled if the discriminant d is at most 26; moreover, GM′
10, GM12,
and GM20 are unirational.

10, GM

′′

In Theorem 1.7 we will extend Theorem 1.4 by including the case d = 28.

Remark 1.5. From the main result of [Ma18] (see also [Pet21]), it follows that only a
ﬁnite number of components of the Noether–Lefschetz locus in GM are unirational (in
such case the discriminant is at most 224). Nevertheless, it does not yet seem clear if
the same holds true about the uniruledness.

Y5

Theorem 1.4 is proved in [Sta21b] by constructing very particular examples of Hodge-
special GM fourfolds; more precisely, examples of pairs (S, X), where S ⊂ Y5 is a smooth
irreducible surface in a smooth Del Pezzo ﬁvefold Y5, and [X] ∈ P(H 0(OY5 (2))) ≃ P39
is a smooth hyperquadric in Y5 containing S (some of the most relevant examples are
included in Table 5). Then, by applying Proposition 1.6 below, which can be done
automatically with the function parameterCount, we deduce that there exists a family
S ⊂ Hilbχ(OS(t))
of surfaces with [S] ∈ S such that the closure of the locus of smooth
hyperquadrics in Y5 containing some surface of S describes an irreducible component
of the Noether–Lefschetz locus in GM. This component is uniruled since it is covered
by curves birational to pencils of GM fourfolds through surfaces of S (indeed we have
h0(IS/Y5(2)) > 1 for each [S] ∈ S).
Proposition 1.6 (Count of parameters). Let V be either P5 or a Del Pezzo ﬁvefold
Y5 = G(1, 4) ∩ P8, and let r be respectively equal to 3 and 2. Let S ⊂ V be a smooth
irreducible surface which is contained in a smooth hypersurface X ⊂ V of degree r.
Assume that

(1) h1(NS/V) = 0, and
(2) h1(OS (r)) = 0 and h0(IS/V(r)) = h0(OV(r)) − χ(OS (r)).

Then there is a unique irreducible component S ⊂ Hilb(V) of the Hilbert scheme of V
that contains [S], and the family XS ⊂ P(H 0(OV(r))) of the hypersurfaces in V of degree
r containing some surface of the family S has codimension at most

dim(P(H 0(OV(r)))) −

h0(NS/V) + h0(IS/V(r)) − h0(NS/X ) − 1

.

Furthermore, if this last value is 1 and by applying the formulas in Subsection 1.2 we
get a non-zero value of d, then XS is a hypersurface; after passing to the quotient mod-
ulo Aut(V), this gives rise to an irreducible component of the Noether–Lefschetz locus
parameterizing fourfolds of discriminant d.

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

Sketch of the proof. See also [Nue15] and [Sta21b, Subsection 1.5]. By the condition
(1), we deduce that the surface S corresponds to a smooth point [S] of the Hilbert

EXPLICIT COMPUTATIONS WITH CUBIC FOURFOLDS AND GM FOURFOLDS

scheme Hilb(V). Therefore there exists a unique irreducible component S of Hilb(V)
that contains [S]. Let

XS = {([S′], [X ′]) : S′ ⊂ X ′} ⊂ S × P(H 0(OV(r)))
be the incidence correspondence. The ﬁber at a point [S′] ∈ S of the ﬁrst projection
π1 : XS → S is isomorphic to the linear space P(H 0(IS′/V(r))). By the semicontinuity
theorem, we have that the dimension of the ﬁber of π1 achieves its minimum value on an
open set of S, and by the condition (2) it follows that the point [S] belongs to this open
set. Therefore there exists a unique irreducible component Z of XS that dominates S,
and its dimension is equal to

dim(Z) = dim(S) + h0(IS/V(r)) − 1 = h0(NS/V) + h0(IS/V(r)) − 1.
Now the ﬁber at the point [X] ∈ P(H 0(OV(r))) of the restriction to Z of the second
projection π2|Z : Z ⊆ XS → P(H 0(OV(r))) contains the point [S, X], and we have
dim[S,X](π2|−1
Z ([X])) ≤ dim[S](Hilb(X)) ≤ h0(NS/X ). By semicontinuity, we deduce
that the generic ﬁber of π2|Z has dimension at most h0(NS/X ). Thus we have

dim(π2(XS )) ≥ dim(π2(Z)) ≥ dim(Z) − h0(NS/X).
Finally, if from the formulas in Subsection 1.2 we get a non-zero value of d, then we
deduce that π2(XS ) does not ﬁll the whole space since its image in the corresponding
(cid:3)
moduli space is contained in the Noether–Lefschetz locus.

1.5. Finding new examples of Hodge-special fourfolds. We present a slight sim-
pliﬁcation of a construction used in [Sta21b] that allows us to ﬁnd new examples of
Hodge-special GM fourfolds and extend the main result obtained there. We start by
ﬁxing a birational transformation ψ : P6 99K G(1, 4) ⊂ P9, which we choose to be the
inverse of the projection from a σ2,2-plane, that is, the transformation deﬁned by the
linear system of quadrics through a Segre threefold Σ3 ≃ P1 × P2 ⊂ P5 ⊂ P6. Now we
want to take some good surface S ⊂ G(1, 4) (possibly smooth and cut out by quadrics),
obtained as the image via ψ of some surface T ⊂ P6, and get a GM fourfold as the
transversal intersection of G(1, 4) with a hyperplane and a hyperquadric through S.
If T does not cut the base locus Σ3 of ψ, we typically obtain uninteresting surfaces
in G(1, 4) which are neither contained in a hyperplane of P9 nor in a hyperquadric of
G(1, 4). Therefore we take surfaces T ⊂ P6 together with an automorphism σ of P6
sending a curve C on T to another curve on Σ3. By replacing T by σ(T ), we obtain a
surface cutting Σ3 at least along a curve, and we can hope the image S = ψ(T ) is good
enough for our purposes. In practice, this can be achieved automatically only if T is
some simple rational surface such that we are able to ﬁnd curves C ⊂ T of low degree
and low genus. So we restrict ourselves to a simpler case. Let T = T (a; i, j, k, . . .) ⊂ P6
be the rational surface obtained as the image of the plane via the linear system of curves
1, . . . , p1
of degree a having i general base points p1
i of multiplicity 1, j general base points
1, . . . , p2
p2
k of multiplicity 3, and so on.
Let C = C(e; l, m, n, . . . ) ⊂ T be the curve which is represented in the plane by a general
1, . . . , p2
curve of degree e passing through l of the i points p1
j ,
n of the k points p3
k, and so on. Suppose we are able to get an automorphism σ

is a surface contained in a (smooth) GM fourfold. We denote by Ga,i,j,k,...
e,l,m,n,... the GM
fourfold obtained as the intersection of G(1, 4) with a general hyperplane and a general
hyperquadric through S (we leave out the dependence on σ).

1.5.1. Running the construction. Using the package SpecialFanoFourfolds we can per-
form the above construction of the GM fourfold Ga,i,j,k,...
e,l,m,n,... by giving just one command:

specialGushelMukaiFourfold([a,i,j,k,...],[e,l,m,n,...])

Optionally, we can specify the coeﬃcient ring as second argument (a large ﬁnite ﬁeld
is used by default). Everything is done automatically, including the searching of the
automorphism σ and the needed checks on the surface S = ψ(σ(T )). If no error message
occurs, then we can conclude that the GM fourfold Ga,i,j,k,...
e,l,m,n,... exists and, most impor-
tantly, has been successfully created. We refer to the online documentation for more
details. See Tables 5 ,6, 8, and 9 for some examples where this procedure works well.
These examples have been found by another function provided by the package (available
only in debug mode) that automatically scans many combinations of pairs of lists of
integers ((a, i, j, k, . . .), (e, l, m, n, . . .)).

1.5.2. Explicit cubic fourfolds of high discriminant. As an application, we can construct
Hodge-special cubic fourfolds of high discriminant. This is just one of the examples. The
projection of the surface S ⊂ Y5 as in the second row of Table 9 from a general plane in
Y5 of type σ2,2 yields a surface R ⊂ P5 of degree 14 and sectional genus 7, cut out by 3
cubics, 6 quartics, and 2 quintics, having 15 nodes as the only singularities, and S as its
normalization. A general cubic fourfold Z ⊂ P5 containing R is smooth, and by (1.1)
and (1.2) we deduce that [Z] ∈ C86. This works in other cases. For instance, starting
from the surface S ⊂ Y5 as in the ﬁfth row of Table 8, we get a cubic fourfold in C62.

1.6. Geometric description of the component GM28. We point out that the exis-
tence of examples of GM fourfolds as in Table 6 extends Theorem 1.4 to another case.
More precisely, we have the following.

Theorem 1.7. The component GM28 is uniruled. In particular, each irreducible com-
ponent of the Noether–Lefschetz locus in GM has negative Kodaira dimension if the
discriminant d is at most 28.

The proof of this result follows from the computation performed in Code Example 1.8
below (see Proposition 1.6). Indeed it tells us that there exists a generically smooth,
27-dimensional, irreducible component S of the Hilbert scheme of a smooth Del Pezzo
ﬁvefold Y5 = P8 ∩ G(1, 4), whose general point corresponds to a smooth rational surface
of degree 11 and sectional genus 4 and with class 6σ3,1 + 5σ2,2 in G(1, 4). The family of
hyperquadrics in Y5 through some surface of S is a hypersurface in P(H 0(OY5 (2))) ≃ P39,
which gives rise to the component GM28 by the formulas (1.3) and (1.4). Moreover, a
general fourfold in GM28 contains only a ﬁnite number of surfaces of S, and the family
of hyperquadrics through a general [S] ∈ S is a projective space of dimension 11. Note,
however, that we are unable to compute the generic members of S and of GM28.

Remark 1.9 (Geometric interpretation of associated K3 surfaces). An integer d of the
form 2(n2 + n + 1)/a2 for some (a, n) ∈ Z2 is always C-admissible, but the converse
, 38 = 2(302+30+1)
, 26 = 2(32+3+1)
is not true. For instance, we have 14 = 2(22+2+1)
,
42 = 2(42+4+1)
, but the next C-admissible value 74 is not of this form.

in Cd, then the following are equivalent:

• the Fano variety F (X) of lines in X is birational to the Hilbert scheme Hilb2(U )
of two points on some K3 surface U of degree d (necessarily associated with X).
Moreover, if a = 1 and [X] ∈ Cd is general, we have an isomorphism F (X) ≃ Hilb2(U ).

The notion of associated K3 surface leads to the following rationality conjecture (see

[Kuz10, AT14, Kuz16, Has16, DIM15]).

Conjecture 1.10 (Kuznetsov’s conjecture). A fourfold [X] ∈ C is rational if and only

2. Moduli spaces of K3 surfaces

The moduli space Fg of polarized K3 surfaces of genus g parametrizes pairs (S, H),
where S is a K3 surface and H ∈ Pic(S) is a primitive polarization class with H 2 = 2g−2.
The dimension of Fg is 19.

2.1. Kodaira dimension of Fg. There are many values of g (although a ﬁnite number)
for which we have no information about the Kodaira dimension of Fg. We now recall the
known results. The following theorem has been established by Mukai in the cases g ≤ 13
and g = 16, 17, 18, 20, by Nuer in the cases g = 14, 20, and by Farkas and Verra in the
cases g = 14, 22. See Tables 3 and 4 for precise references; see also [HS21a, Section 7].

Theorem 2.1. The moduli space Fg is unirational for any g ≤ 22, with the possible
exceptions g ∈ {15, 19, 21}.

On the other side we have the following.

Theorem 2.2 ([GHS07]).

• The moduli space Fg is of general type for any g ≥ 47, with the possible exceptions

g ∈ {48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 60, 62}.

2.2. Connections with cubic fourfolds and GM fourfolds. Let d > 6 be C-
admissible and [X] ∈ Cd general.
If d ≡ 2 mod 6 then X admits a unique associated
K3 surface, while if d ≡ 0 mod 6 then X admits two associated K3 surfaces. Indeed, we
have the following:

Theorem 2.3 ([Has00]). Assume d > 6 is C-admissible. There is a dominant rational
map

ϕd : F d

2 +1

99K Cd,

[S] 7→ [X] : S is associated with X

which is birational for d ≡ 2 mod 6 and a degree 2 cover for d ≡ 0 mod 6.

The map ϕd is not explicit since it is deﬁned at the level of Hodge structures. The

author is not able to determine an equation of [X] = ϕd([S]) from equations of [S].

Remark 2.4 (Non-explicit unirationality of F14 and F20). Nuer in [Nue15] showed that
C26 and C38 are unirational. From this and the birationality of the maps ϕ26 and ϕ38,
he deduced the unirationality of F14 and F20.

Remark 2.5 (Non-explicit unirationality of F14 and F22). We recall the results of Farkas
and Verra on the unirationality of F14 and F22. Let us consider

h3,7
scr = PGL(6)-quotient of the Hilbert scheme of 3-nodal septic scrolls,

From this the unirationality of F14 and F22 follows.

The following remark is particularly useful for us. It follows from Theorem 2.3 in the
case of cubic fourfolds, and from the main result of [BP21] in the case of GM fourfolds.

Remark 2.6 ([Has00, BP21]). Let d be a C-admissible (resp., GM-admissible) value. Let
X be a cubic (resp., GM) fourfold corresponding to a general point in an irreducible
component of the Noether–Lefschetz locus of cubic (resp., GM) fourfolds of discriminant
d. Let S be a K3 surface of genus g = d
2 + 1 which is associated with the fourfold X.
Then S corresponds to a general point in the moduli space Fg.

2.3. Explicit unirationality of Fg. We are interested in the explicit unirationality
of the moduli space Fg, that is, in ﬁnding an explicit dominant rational map from a
projective space to Fg. More precisely, with “explicit” we mean that there is a computer-
implementable procedure to determine the equations of the general member of Fg as a
function of a number of speciﬁc independent variables. The original methods used in
the proof of Theorem 2.1 provide the explicit unirationality of Fg only for g ≤ 12 and
g 6= 11 (see also [KP18] for the case g = 12).

In the following, we recall a construction from [RS21b] and [HS21a] on the explicit
unirationality of Fg for some values of g. Then we show how this can be executed in
practice to get the equations of general K3 surfaces. To be more precise we have the
following (see also Tables 3 and 4).

Theorem 2.7 ([RS21b, HS21a]). The moduli space Fg is explicitly unirational for g =
6, 8, 11, 14, 20, 22.

Note that cases g = 6 and g = 8 are very elementary: general K3 surfaces of genus 6
and 8 can be respectively realized as linear sections of quadratic sections of G(1, 4) ⊂ P9
and as linear sections of G(1, 5) ⊂ P14. However the new method works in the same way
in all cases. The main ingredient used is a good description of a unirational component
of the Noether–Lefschetz locus in the moduli space of cubic fourfolds or GM fourfolds
such that the fourfolds in this component have a Hodge-associated K3 surface of genus
g. So, taking into account Table 2 and Theorems 1.3 and 2.2, we do not exclude that
the same method might be also applied to other values of g in the set

{6, 8, 11, 14, 18, 20, 22, 26, 27, 30, 32, 35, 38, 40}.

In the next subsection we provide more details on the procedure, which is strongly
connected with the proof of Theorem 1.11.

2.4. An overview of the construction to obtain Theorem 2.7. For more details on
this subsection, we refer to [RS21b, Section 4] and [HS21a, Section 6]. Let V be either
P5 or a Del Pezzo ﬁvefold Y5, and let r be respectively equal to 3 and 2, the degree
of the hypersurfaces we consider in V. For each of the components D considered in
′′
Theorem 1.11 parameterizing fourfolds of discriminant d (with the exception of GM
10),
we are able to exhibit an explicit unirational family S ⊂ Hilb(V) of surfaces in V such
that the following hold (actually, we have more than one example; see Tables 7 and 8):
(1) The closure of the locus of smooth hypersurfaces X ⊂ V of degree r containing
some surface S of the family S describes a hypersurface in P(H 0(OV(r))), which
gives rise to the component D of the Noether–Lefschetz locus in the correspond-
ing moduli space C or GM.

(2) For some e ≥ 1, the general member [S] ∈ S admits a congruence of (re − 1)-
secant curves of degree e, parametrized by a variety H. Thus we have a universal
family

X = {([C], p) : [C] ∈ H, p ∈ C ⊂ V} ⊂ H × V

and two projections

where π is birational and its general ﬁber π−1(p) corresponds to the unique curve
[C] ∈ H passing through p and cutting S at re − 1 points.

(3) The linear system |H 0(I e

S/V(re − 1)| of hypersurfaces in V of degree re − 1 with

points of multiplicity e along S deﬁnes a dominant rational map

µ : V 99K W

onto a prime Fano fourfold W of index s = i(W ). In particular, we can realize
the general curve of the congruence as the general ﬁber of the map µ.

(4) By degree reasons, the restriction of µ to a general hypersurface [X] ∈ |H 0(IS/V(r))|
of degree r that contains S gives a birational map µ|X : X 99K W . We have that
the inverse map of µ|X is deﬁned by the linear system of hypersurfaces in W of
degree se − 1 having points of multiplicity e along an irreducible surface U ⊂ W .

where Z ⊂ PN is the closure of the image of the map ϕ : V 99K PN deﬁned by
the linear system of hypersurfaces of degree r through S.

(5) Finally, the surface U ⊂ W can be obtained as a linear projection of a minimal
2 + 1, which is associated with the

2 +1 of degree d and genus d

K3 surface ˜U ⊂ P d
fourfold X.

In this framework, we deﬁne the fundamental locus E ⊂ V of the congruence as the base
locus of the inverse of the projection π in (2.1), that is, E = {p ∈ V : dim(π−1(p)) > 0}.
Then notice that there are two kinds of points on U :

• the points p ∈ W such that µ−1(p) is a curve of the congruence but contained in

the hypersurface X ⊂ V;

• and the points p ∈ µ(E) ⊂ W in the image via µ of E; so that dim µ−1(p) ≥ 2.

A key remark here is that the points of the second kind do not depend on the hypersurface
X ⊂ V through S. So that if X ′ ⊂ V is another general hypersurface of degree r through
S, and U ′ ⊂ W is the corresponding surface deﬁning the inverse of the restriction of µ
to X ′, we must have µ(E) ⊆ U ∩ U ′. Actually, in all cases we have analyzed, it turns out
that µ(E) is the union of the exceptional curves on U and on U ′, which are recoverable
as the top-dimensional components of U ∩ U ′.
In particular, we can determine their
equations from the equations of S in V. Once we have computed the surface U and its
exceptional curves C1, . . . , Ct, we get the minimal associated K3 surface ˜U ⊂ P d
2 +1 as
the closure of the image of the rational map U 99K P d

This function takes as input a Hodge-special fourfold represented by a pair (S, X), with
S ⊂ X ⊂ V as described above. Then, if nothing goes wrong, it returns four objects:2

• the dominant rational map µ : V 99K W deﬁned by the linear system of hyper-

surfaces of degree re − 1 having points of multiplicity e along S;

• the surface U ⊂ W determining the inverse map of the restriction of µ to X;
• the list C = {C1, C2, . . .} of the exceptional curves on the surface U (more
precisely, C1 is the union of the exceptional lines, C2 of the conics, and so on);

• the birational map f : U 99K ˜U ⊂ P d

2 +1 deﬁned by |H +

t
i=1 deg(Ci)Ci|.

Therefore, by taking the image of the last map we get an associated K3 surface ˜U ⊂ P d
with the fourfold X.

Here are a few more details on the computation behind the scenes. The ﬁrst task of
the procedure is to try to detect the congruence of curves. This is done by considering
the map ϕ : V 99K Z ⊂ PN that appears in (2.2) deﬁned by the linear system of
hypersurfaces of degree r through S, checking that it is birational, and then analyzing
the lines on Z passing through its general point. Indeed, if ϕ is birational, it induces a
1–1 correspondence:

curves of degree e in V passing

Once the congruence is detected, the next tasks are to compute the map µ : V 99K W
and the surface U ⊂ W corresponding to X. There are several ways to determine
the equations of U . The strategy often adopted by Macaulay2 is based on the fact
that we have a 1–1 correspondence between the two linear systems |H 0(IS/X(r))| and
|H 0(IU/W (s))|, which follows from the commutativity of the diagram (2.2).
In most
of the known cases, S is cut out by hypersurfaces of degree r and U is cut out by
hypersurfaces of degree s.

2.6. Running the construction with a example. In the following, we run the pro-
cedure with an example of fourfold constructed as described in the last row of Table 8.
This is a very special GM fourfold X ⊂ Y5 = G(1, 4) ∩ P8 which contains a smooth
rational surface S ⊂ P8 of degree 9 and sectional genus 2 with class 5σ3,1 + 4σ2,2 in
G(1, 4). Thus [X] ∈ GM
26 are
of this type (see Code Example 2.10). It seems relevant to notice that this surface S, as
a subvariety of P8, is the same surface that appears in the fourth row of Table 8 and in
Code Example 2.11, that is the surface considered in [HS20] to describe the component
GM20 (indeed, both can be realized as the image of the plane via the linear system of
quartic curves through three simple points and one double point in general position).
This surface also admits a congruence of 3-secant conics inside Y5, and the linear system
of cubic hypersurfaces in Y5 with double points along S gives a dominant rational map
µ : Y5 99K W ⊂ P5 onto a smooth quadric hypersurface W ⊂ P5. The restriction of µ to
X is a birational map X 99K W whose inverse is deﬁned by the linear system of hyper-
surfaces of degree 7 in W with double points along a smooth irreducible surface U ⊂ W

and one exceptional twisted cubic C. The linear system |H + L1 + · · · + L4 + 3C| on U

The congruence of 3-secant conics to S can be detected by considering the map ϕ :
Y5 99K Z ⊂ P13 deﬁned by the quadrics through S. Indeed, we have that through the
general point of Z there pass 6 lines, which come from ﬁve 1-secant lines to S and one
single 3-secant conic to S. This is performed by the following code.

Code Example 2.9. We run the function detectCongruence for the fourfold X con-
structed in Code Example 2.8 (last row of Table 8).

i16 : time c = detectCongruence(X,Verbose=>true);

At this point, Macaulay2 knows that the fourfold X is rational. A command such as
parametrize(X) gives us a rational parameterization of X.

We conclude with a count of parameters (see Proposition 1.6) which shows that the
family of fourfolds X as in the last row of Table 8 describes a locus of codimension 2 in
′′
GM, hence of codimension 1 in GM

26.

Code Example 2.10. We run the function parameterCount for the fourfold X con-
structed in Code Example 2.8 (last row of Table 8).

-- in particular, h^0(I_{S,Y}(2)) is minimal
-- h^0(N_{S,X}) = 0

Code Example 2.11 (Explicit unirationality of F11). Here we construct a random
GM fourfold X ⊂ Y5 = G(1, 4) ∩ P8 in the component GM20 which contains a smooth
rational surface S ⊂ Y5 of degree 9, sectional genus 2, and class 6σ3,1 + 3σ2,2 in G(1, 4),
as described in [HS20] and [RS21b, Remark 5.8] (see also the fourth row of Table 8).
Therefore, the corresponding associated K3 surface is a random K3 surface of genus 11
in P11. In the notation of the diagrams (2.2) and (2.3), we have r = 2, e = 2, s = 5,
W = P4, U ⊂ W is a non-normal surface of degree 10 and sectional genus 8, and the
exceptional curves on (the normalization of) U are one line and one twisted cubic curve.
See also [HS21a, Section 6] for more details on this calculation.

Remark 2.12. The command K3(11) provided by the package K3Surfaces [HS21b] ex-
ecutes the procedure in Code Example 2.11 and returns a random K3 surface of genus
11. The same command can be called with other values of g, for which an explicit
unirationality construction is known (see Tables 3 and 4).

Code Example 2.13 (Explicit unirationality of F20). Here we construct a random
cubic fourfold in the component C38 which contains a smooth rational surface of degree
10 and sectional genus 6 as described in [Nue15] and [RS21b, Section 3] (see also the
ﬁfth row of Table 7). Therefore, the corresponding associated K3 surface is a random
K3 surface of genus 20 in P20. In the notation of the diagrams (2.2) and (2.3), we have
r = 3, e = 2, s = 5, W = P4, U ⊂ W is a smooth surface of degree 12 and sectional
genus 14, and the exceptional curves on U are 10 lines and one rational normal quartic
