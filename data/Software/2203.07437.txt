Abstract

In this paper we propose an artiﬁcial intelligence imaging solution to support archaeologists in the classiﬁcation task
of Roman commonware potsherds. Usually, each potsherd is represented by its sectional proﬁle as a two dimensional
black-white image and printed in archaeological books related to speciﬁc archaeological excavations. The partiality
and handcrafted variance of the fragments make their matching a challenging problem: we propose to pair simi-
lar proﬁles via the unsupervised hierarchical clustering of non-linear features learned in the latent space of a deep
convolutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) network. Our contribution also include the creation of a ROman COm-
monware POTtery (ROCOPOT) database, with more than 4000 potsherds proﬁles extracted from 25 Roman pottery
corpora, and a MATLAB GUI software for the easy inspection of shape similarities. Results are commented both
from a mathematical and archaeological perspective so as to unlock new research directions in both communities.

1. Introduction

Our ability to interpret an archaeological site rests
on our capacity to recognise the material culture found
in it, ranging from ﬁxed structures to movable ob-
jects. Archaeological ﬁnds from any site do in fact con-
tribute to deﬁning its chronology, function and place
within a broader network of relationships with other
sites. Thanks to their relative resilience against decay
combined with their speciﬁc underlying patterns of pro-
duction, distribution and consumption, ceramic vessels
(pottery) – whether fragmented (i.e. potsherds) or in-
tact – represent some of the most common ﬁnds recov-

and potsherds are usually recorded as 2D proﬁles and,
in consideration of their morphological features (e.g.
shape of the rim or the base), gathered in systematic cat-
alogues (corpora), where patterns of similarity are used
to establish relationships, in terms of function, chronol-
ogy or both [1].

Within Roman archaeology speciﬁcally (albeit not
exclusively), fundamental signiﬁcance has been as-
cribed to those ceramic classes more closely associ-
ated with long-distance trade and contact, namely trade
containers (amphorae) and high-quality tableware pots
(ﬁnewares). However, these were middle-range com-
modities that did not reach all levels of the society in the
same way, and, furthermore, their supply varied enor-
mously over space and time. Indeed, some sites might
have had limited or no access to this range of objects,
and such notable absence in the archaeological record
might indicate their abandonment at a time when they
were in full occupation (i.e. reduced archaeological vis-
ibility). In contrast, ordinary table– and kitchen–ware
(commonwares, also referred to as coarsewares) were
considerably cheaper and mainly supplied within a lo-
cal/regional network of distribution. As a result, they
almost invariably constitute the bulk of pottery ﬁnds at
almost every Roman site. Even though one would ex-
pect them to provide a most eﬀective baseline for the
dating (and more general interpretation) of Roman sites
anywhere, their huge range of forms, poorly deﬁned
chronologies and scattered provenance have made their
study so challenging (and so little promising) that many
have favoured the analysis of the far more standardised

and easily recognisable ﬁnewares and amphorae.

Nevertheless, when a special eﬀort is made to include
a comprehensive study of commonware sherds, result-
ing interpretations can dramatically change. This was
neatly shown by a recent analysis of the chronologi-
cal distribution of potsherds recovered from the Roman
town of Interamna Lirenas and from across its surround-
ing countryside (Central Italy) [2]. Whereas traditional
reliance on ﬁnewares and amphorae had outlined a tra-
jectory of precocious demographic decline (already in
progress by the late 1st century BC), the widespread
presence of commonwares shows a considerably more
gradual process of growth, in fact peaking in the course
of the 1st century AD, with little or no sign of decline
until about two centuries later, see Figure 1. There can
be no doubt that the study of commonwares should be a
priority within (Roman) material culture studies. How-
ever, this does not make the obstacles which archaeolo-
gists have to face any less real. What is indeed needed
is to improve and expand our classiﬁcation of this vast
and varied body of evidence in a way which is consid-
erably more eﬀective and less time-consuming than it
currently is.

Contributions. The contribution of this paper is two-
fold. Firstly, we create the ROman COmmonware POT-
tery (ROCOPOT) database containing two-dimensional
black-white imaging proﬁles of commonware potsherds
attested in Central Tyrrhenian Italy, with metadata ex-
trapolated from diﬀerent corpora and excavation sites.
Secondly, we propose an unsupervised workﬂow for
matching and hierarchically clustering the potsherds
proﬁles by comparing their latent representation learned
in a deep convolutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
network, and supported by a MATLAB GUI software
for the easy inspection of the results on the ﬁeld.

Scope. Our research aims to support archaeologists in
the classiﬁcation task of Roman commonware potsherds
by unveiling new similarity patterns between individual
proﬁles as featured in relevant corpora, especially those

2

for which no match has so far been proposed. The re-
sulting clustering patterns will highlight new morpho-
logical relationships and serve as an additional tool for
archaeologists in order to improve their understanding
of chronology, distribution, function and development
of Roman commonwares over time. Whereas other sim-
ilar projects have attempted to develop automated pro-
cedures for the correct identiﬁcation of potsherds (i.e.
establishing a relationship between what is newly found
and the published 2D proﬁles), we aim to improve the
internal consistency of the database itself and facilitate
the archaeological classiﬁcation workﬂow. On top of
that, our workﬂow is fully scalable, meaning that once
new proﬁles are available as black-white images, the
learned representation features will unlock additional
matches. The complete pipeline, from archaeological
ﬁeldwork to our contributions, is reported in Figure 2.

Related works. Shape recognition, classiﬁcation and
matching of complete or partial data, are well-
established problems in the computer vision and math-
ematical communities but for settled databases of thou-
sands of images or shapes, e.g. [3, 4, 5]. In recent years,
“Cultural Heritage Imaging Science” became an in-
creasing popular research ﬁeld bringing together experts
from museum institutions, history of art, physics, chem-
istry, computer vision and mathematics departments for
tackling cross-discipline challenging applications; how-
ever, few dedicated databases emerged in the literature,
mainly related to collection of paintings and associated
tasks, e.g. for object or people detection [6, 7, 8], style
recognition [9] and many more, see [10].

Relevant works for matching 2D shapes are based
on similarities of boundaries [11, 12] or skeletons [13],
homeomorphic transformations based on size functions
[14], geodesic calculus for image morphing [15], ax-
iomatic criteria for deformable shapes [16] or compar-
ison of invariant image moments [17, 18, 19, 20]. In
particular, invariant shape descriptors are detailed in
[21] for clustering together similar shapes while the
meaningfulness of the obtained clusters is still an open
question. For 3D surfaces (with triangular meshes)
or volumes (with voxels), remarkable results are ob-
tained via scale invariant descriptors based on the eigen-
decomposition of the Laplace–Beltrami operator, e.g.
the Heat Kernel Signature and its variants [22, 23, 24].
For the targeted application of this paper, even fewer
databases are publicly available [25, 26, 27], with fo-
cus on their automatic digitisation, shape extraction and
visual presentation [28] or the clustering of a-priori
manually selected geometric shape features into similar
classes, e.g. by comparing curve skeletons [29], shape

boundaries [30], shape descriptors [31] or employing
Generalised Hough Transform distance measures (in the
case of petroglyphs, a dataset that shares similarity with
our images) [32] and other topological features (e.g.
pixels height and width, area, circularity, rectangularity,
diameters or steepness indexes) [33, 34] or comparison
with template primitives [35].
In [36] fragments and
nodal points are also extracted from complete 3D mod-
els in view of a supervised deep learning approach start-
ing from complete proﬁles. Recently, it is worth men-
tioning the deep-learning approach based on convolu-
tional neural networks (CNNs) proposed in [37], which
targeted the imaging classiﬁcation of decorative styles
in Tusayan White Ware (Northeast Arizona).

In contrast, our deep-learning approach is not biased
by the selection of a-priori shape features, allowing for
their unsupervised extraction by means of a deep convo-
lutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) network. Here,
we force the VAE latent space to follow a prior probabil-
ity distribution close to a standard Gaussian. Such reg-
ularisation has many advantages for unsupervised tasks
mainly related to the easy reparametrisation of the vari-
ational lower bound and backpropagation through the
stochastic layers [38]. Our approach is motivated by
the high availability of fragments and the generative
process of VAE, allowing us to extend the learned model
to unseen data for extracting their shape features.

In pattern recognition, hierarchical clustering is a
non-parametric yet versatile unsupervised approach for
unveiling inherent structures in data, ordered in a tree
called dendrogram [39]. The method is based on the
recursive partitioning of the VAE features into clusters
of (increasing or decreasing) cardinality, based on the
minimisation of a certain cost function that promotes
the separability of the data features [40]. Hierarchical
clustering methods are easy to implement and they are
often tuned to the application at hand, with an external
evaluation of the results by the experts in the applied

3

ﬁeld [41].

Speciﬁcally to Roman pottery proﬁles, our approach
for an unsupervised hierarchical clustering is in line
with the promising works in [34, 42, 30, 32, 43], with
the additional automatisation of the cluster merging rule
based on the best cophenetic coeﬃcient score [44]. Fi-
nally, we leave the check of the deeper clusters in the
produced dendrograms to specialist archaeologists, who
can eﬀectively assess the performances of the proposed
workﬂow.

Organisation of the paper. The paper is organised as
follows: in Section 2 we introduce the ROman COm-
monware POTtery (ROCOPOT) database; in Section 3
we detail about the deep variational autoencoder (VAE)
network for extracting the potsherds features and the hi-
erarchical clustering algorithm (with appendix on com-
putations in Section 6); in Section 4 we discuss the re-
sults obtained by our workﬂow.

2. The ROCOPOT Database

The ROman COmmoware POTtery (ROCOPOT)
database, downloadable from [45], comprises of more
than 4000 black-white images, consisting of two-
dimensional representation of the section (proﬁle) of
Roman commonware vessels. These proﬁles are fea-
tured in a series of archaeological corpora [46, 47, 48,
49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62,
63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70] which provide a rep-
resentative sample of a wide array of vessel-forms at-
tested across the Tyrrhenian side of the Italian penin-
sula in the Roman period (from Liguria to Campa-

database (future extensions are planned). All these
images are scanned at 300dpi from the archaeologi-
cal corpora:
these are saved in the lossless .png for-
mat with an identiﬁcation string ﬁlename of the form

the catalogue while PAGENUM and FIGID are the page
and the ﬁgure identiﬁcation numbers of the printed pro-
ﬁle in the corpora, respectively. This labelling conven-
tion is suitable for a fast inspection of the results de-
scribed in Section 4: by assuming similar shapes are
presented closely in each catalogue (as is normally the
case), we can quickly look at ﬁlenames to evaluate po-
tential matches.

Since the original proﬁles can be composed of mul-
tiple (rarely intact) parts, we reﬁned the database iden-
tifying a total of 407 bases (B), 450 handles (H), 3678
rims1 (R) and 451 rims with handles (RH), as well as the
original shapes (O). The archaeologists identiﬁed such
parts out of each original proﬁle depending on its grade
of completeness. Potential outliers like one of a kind
proﬁles were removed. Details about the number of pro-
ﬁles in our database are summarised in Table 1 (see also
the map in Figure 5), where for each catalogue we high-
light the bibliographic reference, the publication year,
the chronology and location of the archaeological site.
For the rest of this work we focused only on the rims as
they are assumed to carry out the most signiﬁcant geo-
metric information of the handcrafted material.

All the rims require a further polishing step so as to
make them uniformly represented in the imaging space
and before processing them into the deep learning al-
gorithm. This is due to diﬀerent presentation/editorial
styles adopted across the corpora. For example, in Fig-
ure 3 we report common situations when identifying the
rim, e.g. its separation from the template and cutting of
the elongated slope as well as mirroring (Figure 3a), the
ﬁll in of relevant portions with a black colour with a
possible rotation of the proﬁle (Figure 3b), the cleaning
of scanned contours from ageing phenomena and the re-
moval of undesired handles (Figure 3c and 3d). Further-
more, based on the convert script from Imagemagick2,
we converted the extracted rims from .png format to a
.svg format so as to remove pixelisation errors (den-
sity 1200 and 1500 × 1500 pixels). All the rims are then
resized to 256 × 256 pixels, without loosing the aspect
ratio, for the purpose of data normalisation in the deep
learning network described in the rest of the paper, see
Figure 4 for a full display of rims in our database.

1the rim usually refers to a rounded moulding on the lip of a jar,

bowl, or dish, both to add strength and assist in handling [71].

3. Proposed approach

After preprocessing the ROCOPOT database and
with the rim proﬁles at our disposal, we proceed with
modelling the manifold of proﬁles by learning non-
linear features associated to them. Such features will be
used for the hierarchical clustering of the dataset. Note
that the combination of these two approaches makes our
workﬂow totally unsupervised, a key assumption for un-
veiling hidden or new clustering patterns in existing ar-
chaeological corpora.

3.1. Variational Autoencoders.

Our workﬂow is based on the learning of probabilis-
tic features associated with proﬁles, able to ease the
proﬁle matching problem in a low-dimensional feature
space. Instead of ﬁxing a-priori qualitative proﬁle fea-
tures (e.g. the diameter, the ballness, the elongation, the
area, the perimeter and many more), we ﬁx the dimen-
sion k > 0 of the latent space and maximise the prob-
ability that proﬁles, generated from a stochastic sam-
pling process in the latent space, match with the pro-
ﬁles in our database. In this sense, deep learning convo-
lutional Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful
tools that can be interpreted as a generative non-linear
version of the principle component analysis (PCA).

latent space. Any AE is composed by an encoder,
which reduces the dimension of the input to the latent
space, and a decoder, which reconstructs the output
from the latent space. More advanced Stacked Sparse
Autoencoders (SSAEs) [73] networks concatenate mul-
tiple vanilla AE, where each latent space is the input of
the subsequent AE. Here, the sparsity assumption forces
the neurons to specialise on few high-level features [74].
However, both AE and SSAE are limited by their (pos-
sibly) discontinuous latent space, making thus impos-
sible the interpolation between multiple input data and
leading to the overﬁtting phenomenon. This is a limi-
tation for scaling-up the approach when processing un-
seen data.

In contrast, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [38,
75] are generative deep learning convolutional neural
networks able to learn a continuous probabilistic rep-
resentation of the global potsherds features in the latent
space. The loss function in the network is composed by
a regulariser term plus a reconstruction term:

L(x, x) = βeLKL(x, z) + Lc(x, x),

(1)

where βe > 0 is a weighting parameter varying accord-
ing to the learning epoch e, LKL(x, z) is the loss function
accounting for the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) diver-
gence DKL on the latent space, see (5) in the Appendix
6 and Figure 6, while the Lc(x, x) is a sigmoid cross-
entropy energy with logits loss, see (6) in Appendix

Figure 5: Location of the sites mentioned in Table 1.

Vanilla convolutional Autoencoders (AEs) are artiﬁ-
cial neural networks designed for replicating the input
at its output by means of back-propagating the recon-
structed result with a single layer strategy [72]. Here,
the representation of the input is learned via the minimi-
sation of a loss function, composed by a reconstruction
error measure and a regulariser, in a low-dimensional

6

6. By acting as regulariser, LKL(x, z) ensures that the
potsherds distribution generated from the learned latent
space is as close as possible to the target one, while
Lc(x, x) measures the probability error of reconstruct-
ing black-white pixels in a potsherd image, similarly to
a labelling task. More details about our chosen struc-
ture of the VAE network and technical parameters for
the training process are given in Section 4.

3.2. Hierarchical clustering.

Once the VAE network is trained, we can associate
to each proﬁle a low-dimentional latent vector z ∈ Rk
with k > 0. From the reparametrisation trick discussed
in (7) in Section 6.4, i.e. z = µ + σ (cid:12) ε where ε ∈ Rk
is a random vector, we concatenate the mean µ ∈ Rk
and the variance σ ∈ Rk in a vector of features z ∈ R2k.
These features can now be used as a shape signature
for the clustering task. Since popular clustering meth-
ods, like k-means, have the bottleneck of requiring as
input the number of expected clusters (unknown for
our database), we opted for an agglomerative hierar-
chical clustering approach so as to build a tree of nested
clusters. Starting with a single class for each potsherd
proﬁle, we subsequently merge together proﬁles shar-
ing similar features in a bottom-up hierarchical strategy
according to a method for computing the distance be-
tween clusters and a metric between the observed fea-
In this way, we can inspect diﬀerent levels of

similarities and shape relations. In order to automati-
cally identify the best cluster merging rule, we compute
the cophenetic coeﬃcient score [44] for each pair of
methods (nearest distance [76], farthest distance [77],
UPGMA [78], WPGMA [78], UPGMC [79], WPGMC
[80] and ward [81]) and metrics (Euclidean, cityblock,
Chebychev and cosine). Here, the cophenetic score [82]
measures how faithfully the selected tree represents the
dissimilarities among observation and the pair returning
the highest value is selected as the best pair.

4. Network Parameters and Results

In this section we further discuss the parameters of
our VAE network and the results produced by our work-
ﬂow, when applied to the rims in our database. All the
tests are performed on a GPU Nvidia Quadro P6000.
The code is implemented in MATLAB 2020b.

4.1. Parameters and analysis of the VAE network.

Our VAE network is composed by multiple convolu-
tional layers of ﬁlter size 3×3, concatenated with ad-hoc

exponential linear unit (eLU) and dropout layers3 (with
ﬁxed dropout parameter equal to 0.25). With reference
to Figure 6 where the VAE network used in this work is
depicted, x is the original black-white proﬁle (256×256
pixels) and x is the output of the network. Note that x is
required for computing the reconstruction loss Lc in (1),
while the output proﬁle is obtained by sig(x). Also, each
convolutional layer is denoted by conv f1, f2,n,s, where f1
are the number of input channels, f2 are the number of
ﬁlters, n is the spatial size of the ﬁlters and s is the stride.
In the network, parameters are set to f = 4, n = 3 and
s = 1 while k = 128 is the dimension of the latent space.
We account for handcrafted details, printing or scan-
ning artefacts by increasing the number of potsherds
at our disposal 5 times via data augmentation, e.g. by
adding variations of the original shapes obtained via im-
age operations like erosion and dilation (of 3 pixels) and
rotations (by −5 and +5 degrees). We trained our net-
work on 90% of the rims available, using the remaining
10% as test data, and for a maximum number of 1000
epochs. The learned parameters are updated using the
Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) [83], with con-
stant learning rate of 1e-06.

In order to avoid the so-called KL-vanishing phe-
nomenon, related to the undesired vanishing of the reg-
ulariser during the optimisation, the regularisation term
is weighted by a positive factor βe ∈ (0, 1]. Among
diﬀerent choices [84, 85] (applied to natural language
processing challenges), we follow the cyclical anneal-
ing approach [86] with a periodical adjustment of the
weight βe of (1) in M cycles. For a ﬁxed epoch e, the
weight βe is computed according to the following rule:

βe =





f (τe)
1

if τ ≤ R,
otherwise

for a linear function f (τe) = τe/R and

τe = mod(e − 1, (cid:100)T/M(cid:101))/(T/M),

where T is maximum number of epochs, M is the num-
ber of cycles and R is the rate of which to increase βe
within a cycle. Thus, each cycle is composed by an an-
nealing stage where βe linearly increases from 0 to 1,
and a ﬁxing stage when βe = 1. This strategy forces
the model to behaves like AEs when starting each cy-
cle with βe = 0 and like standard VAEs when βe = 1;
in contrast, the model transits from a point estimate to
a distribution estimate when linearly increasing βe from
0 to 1. The cyclic repetition guarantees a progressive

learning, leading to a more meaningful latent space.
In our experiments, we ﬁxed T = 1000, M = 4 and
R = 0.5, for a cycling annealing strategy as depicted in
Figure 8a. Note that if βe (cid:29) 1 the loss would have re-
lated to the β-VAE extension, proposed by [75] and used
for learning disentangled representation features in the
latent space [87], but at the price of a reduced recon-
struction quality [88].

Once our network is trained we are able to model
the probability distribution of potsherds with z ∈ Rk
(k = 128 parameters), and to reconstruct the ROCOPOT
dataset from Figure 4. We report in Figure 7 the conﬁ-
dence intervals of the pixel-wise mean squared error and
the intersection over the union error as a distance [89],

8

In Figure 8b we display the loss function on both
train and test data, individual terms (KL loss and cross-
entropy reconstruction loss) and the Euclidean error
through epochs, showing no overﬁtting during the train-
ing of the network. Both visual and quantitative results
conﬁrms that the shapes are reconstructed almost cor-
rectly, meaning that the neurons in the latent space are
now specialised in modelling the probability distribu-
tion of the potsherds in our database.

Before using the 2k(= 256) features for the hierarchi-
cal clustering step, a natural question is to investigate
the quality of the reconstruction and the robustness of
the latent space to some perturbations.

4.2. Robustness of the learned features.

Our matching assumption is based on the fact that
similar shapes share similar VAE latent space represen-
tation. Thus, it is worth to investigate if the shapes and
the features in the latent space are robust to a series
of perturbations that may occur with handcrafted data.
In Figure 9 we report the reconstruction of a subset of
potsherds in the ROCOPOT database under a range of
perturbations on the input shape (erosion, dilation and

rotation) as well as small perturbations with a random
numbers of the parameters in latent space. In particu-
lar, we compare the reconstruction of shapes from la-
tent space features after undergoing pixel erosion (of
3, 5, 7 pixels), dilation (of 3, 5, 7 pixels) and shape ro-
tation (of −5, −3, 3, 5 degrees), as well as the applica-
tion of a random Gaussian perturbation on the features
in latent space (1%, 5% and 10% of the feature values,
respectively). The proximity of the latent space repre-
sentations of all shapes to their perturbed variants has
been computed and visualised in the T-SNE plot of Fig-
ure 9, conﬁrming the robustness of the learned features
to perturbations, and the ability to match together very
similar proﬁles. This is a visual demonstration of the
feasibility of our clustering approach for the potsherds.

4.3. Hierarchical clustering.

As said, our approach takes advantage of the learned
features in the VAE’s latent space for the hierarchi-
cal clustering task.
In our experiments the highest
cophenetic score is obtained with the choice of the
Unweighted Pair Group Method using arithmetic Av-

erages (UPGMA, average) and the Euclidean met-
ric for measuring the distance between clusters. We
now restrict our focus on relevant types extracted from
the metadata of our dataset. These are: domestic
amphora, basin, beaker, bottle, bowl, censer,
dish, dish-lid, dolium, jar, jug, knob, lid,
mortarium, pan, pot and unguentarium. For all the
potsherds proﬁles in each type, we extracted the relevant
features with the VAE strategy described before, which
are hierarchically clustered in view of extracting new
similarity patters. As an example, we report a portion
of the hierarchical dendrogram for the type beaker in
Figure 10a. For convenience, we call seed each of these
pairs, corresponding to the paired leaves at the deep-
est level of the dendrogram. The same dendrogram can
be produced also for each single catalogue if needed to
inspect intra-catalogue similarities, see Figure 10b for
CICI96 [47].

4.4. Unveiling hidden relations: the ROCOPOT App.

Given the cross-disciplinary nature of the challenge
in this paper, we need a tool for visualising and inspect-
ing the clusters in the dendrograms. To this end, we de-
veloped a MATLAB GUI4 which is able to eﬀectively
support the onﬁeld work of the archaeologists [91], see
the screenshot in Figure 11.

4.5. Comments from the archaeological perspective

In order to test how eﬀective our workﬂow is in
recognising actual similarities between diﬀerent pro-
ﬁles, we inspect the quality of the dendrograms via the
MATLAB app.

The lack of a ground truth in matching potsherds, it-
self resulting from a degree of inherent subjectivity in
the manual classiﬁcation process, has a great impact on
an automatic evaluation of the performances. Therefore
the task of validating the matching accuracy of the den-
drograms is assigned to archaeologists. Although, in
principle, one could evaluate the coherence of each hier-
archical group (of proﬁles) within the dendrogram, this
task would involve a rather complex review of the re-
sults. Therefore, we asked archaeologists to concentrate
on and validate the matching accuracy for each individ-
ual seed, expected to be the best match proposed by our
unsupervised workﬂow.

Before proceeding, we acknowledge that a large
number of proﬁles in our dataset may in fact represent
somewhat unique vessels bearing little or no similarity

to any other. Roman commonwares consisted of ordi-
nary pottery which was produced at a myriad of dis-
tinct workshops, the latter often coming into and go-
ing out of existence in the lapse of a generation. We
should therefore expect the range of vessels produced,

distributed and consumed, even within the same region
and in the same period, to be considerably vast and var-
ied. This otherwise unbridled drive towards a variety
of forms was certainly directed - and to a degree tem-
pered - by the practicalities of the production process

ing two similar proﬁles within the 2462 available is less
than 0.001%.

It is certainly notable that our workﬂow was au-
tonomously capable of establishing close similarity be-
tween proﬁles which were originally recognised as
’similar’ by the original authors. This suggests that the
workﬂow may have learned to look for the same com-
bination of features which a pottery specialist normally
looks for when classifying pottery. Although replicat-
ing such results may in itself be considered a notable
achievement from a mathematical point of view, it is
the fact that the range of similarities was expanded that
matters a lot from an archaeological point of view. If
one considers that each pottery catalogue is a reﬂec-
tion of relevant patterns of production, distribution and
consumption within a given location in a given period,
an improved understanding of their inter-relationship
can truly contribute not only to reﬁning chronologies
(useful as this exercise may be), but also to mapping
how (trade) contacts between diﬀerent places were cre-
ated and evolved over the Roman period. Even though
such patterns are routinely reconstructed on the base of
the distribution of ﬁnewares and amphorae, we already
pointed out that these classes may not provide as com-
prehensive a view of the broader population as com-
monwares can.

In short, the proposed workﬂow is very promising,
especially when considering its inherent scalability. As
the dataset is expanded with the inclusion of new pro-
ﬁles from additional pottery corpora, the learning step
will improve, thus increasing the chance of recognis-
ing more (and possibly qualitatively better) similarities.
More than anything, the clustering step is capable of
structuring in minutes the kind of dataset whose size
would require months (or indeed years!) of manual re-
viewing a long list of disparate publications. In fact, al-
though here applied to commonware pottery from Cen-
tral Tyrrhenian Italy, this workﬂow can be straightfor-
wardly extended not only to Roman commonwares in
general, but to any coherent pottery class from any time
and/or period. Although this process is neither infalli-
ble or exhaustive, it is in fact meant not to replace, but
rather to aid in the manual interpretation and classiﬁca-
tion of pottery proﬁles by unveiling additional relation-
ships which the mass of data may render almost invisi-
ble to the human eye.

5. Conclusions and Future Works

In this paper, we introduced the ROman COmmon-
ware POTtery proﬁles (ROCOPOT) database and pro-

(e.g. standardization) and the predominantly functional
character of these objects. Of course, given the high
levels of inter-connectivity and exchange achieved in
the Roman world (and Central Tyrrhenian Italy was cer-
tainly no exception!), local potters worked within pro-
ductive traditions which were used to absorb, copy and
rework types originally imported from elsewhere, and
whose features may have appeared from time to time
better suited to speciﬁc functions or even just the tastes
of potential customers. Nevertheless, only a fraction of
the whole dataset may have in fact featured any actual
degree of close similarity.

Our workﬂow processes 3678 rim proﬁles as featured
in 25 catalogues (R in Table 1) and identiﬁes 1231 seeds
(corresponding to 2462 proﬁles). The archaeologists
looked at each seed by inspecting and comparing the
paired proﬁles, thus assessing their similarity. They did
not consider the overall shape of the vessel (even when
known), but instead only concentrated on the overall
combination of morphological features as presented by
each individual rim (e.g. inclination, curve, lip design).
This approach did not present any particular challenge
to them as it was very much in keeping with standard
practice in the analysis of (incomplete) potsherds as
most commonly recovered through ﬁeldwork. In light
of the above archaeological considerations about the na-
ture of the data itself, it is not surprising that only 500
out of 1231 seeds (41%) were eventually validated as
a positive match. What is remarkable, however, is that
out of those 500 positive seeds, only 147 (29%) had al-
ready been indicated as close matches in the relevant
pottery corpora, whilst the remaining 353 (71%) are
new. In other words, although some of these similari-
ties have been in fact recognised and recorded when the
pottery corpora were originally put together by their au-
thors, our workﬂow is able to signiﬁcantly expand this
range of relationships. This goes far beyond a random

11

vided a workﬂow for unveiling close similarities be-
tween (Roman commonware) pottery proﬁles. That is
based on the hierarchical clustering of Roman potsherds
via latent features learned in a deep convolutional VAE
network. Such features are proved to be robust to a
number of perturbations mimicking the real scenario of
the high shape variance due to handcrafted materials.
The most obvious advantage provided by our approach
rests in the ability to ease and speed up the processing
and matching of a very large number of pottery pro-
ﬁles from diﬀerent corpora within a coherent and uni-
ﬁed analytical environment. This is achieved by pre-
senting the pottery specialist with a selection of most
likely matches in the companion software, thus pro-
viding invaluable pointers not only in the development
of a comprehensive typology of Roman commonwares,
but even in the future classiﬁcation of potsherds com-
ing from new excavations. These results are very en-
couraging and prompt us to pursue this research further.
Firstly, we plan to increase the number of proﬁles avail-
able in our database; secondly we will develop a speciﬁc
online tool which will aid in the classiﬁcation of pro-
ﬁles of new commonware potsherds recovered by new
archaeological projects (and thus increasing our knowl-
edge on this pottery class whilst expanding its applica-
tion in the ﬁeld). Finally, we aim to train the network to
include other parts of the vessels (bases, main body) in
its similarity search and fully incorporate the feedback
(validation) of the archaeologists in order to reﬁne its
analysis through iteration.

Here we discuss the main concepts of variational au-
toencoders and the derivation of the loss function in
Equation (1), by means of (5) and (6), see [38, 92].

We assume that

the dataset consists of X =
(x1, . . . , xn) samples, with n > 0 (in our case n two-
dimensional black-white images representing the pro-
ﬁle of potsherds of size H × W from the ROCOPOT

database). We identify with x ∈ X one sample from
the dataset and with x ∈ Y the reconstruction of x,
where Y is the reconstruction of the space X. Also,
let gφ( · ) and fθ( · ) be the encoding and decoding func-
tions, parametrised by φ and θ, respectively. Moreover,
qφ(z | x) represents the estimated posterior probability
distribution (probabilistic encoder) for the latent code
z ∈ Rk given x and pθ(x | z) the likelihood of generating
true data samples x given the latent code z (probabilis-
tic decoder). Here k > 0 is the ﬁxed dimension of the
reduced latent space. In general, The Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence DKL(q (cid:107) p) is a non-symmetric relative
entropy designed to quantify the discrepancy between
two distributions q and p and how much information is
lost if the distribution q is used to represent p.

6.1. The Evidence Lower Bound Loss in VAE

In the AE scheme,

the idea is to learn a low-
dimensional representation z = gφ(x) ∈ Rk of the data
by means of learning the identity function such that
x = fθ(gφ(x)). The overﬁtting and the impossibility to
generate new samples are clear limits of this approach.
Conversely, VAEs aim to learn the model underlying
the estimated posterior qφ(z | x) is designed
the data:
to be close to the real posterior pθ(z | x) making pos-
sible to generate true samples. To that eﬀect, the for-
ward or reverse KL divergence could be used. The
forward KL divergence DKL(pθ(z | x) (cid:107) qφ(z | x)) tends
to favour an approximate distribution qφ with an un-
desired mean eﬀect; conversely the reversed KL diver-
gence DKL(qφ(z | x) (cid:107) pθ(z | x)) is better suited to approx-

where in the above we used pθ(z | x) = pθ(z, x)/pθ(x),
(cid:82)
qφ(z | x) dz = 1 and pθ(z, x) = pθ(x | z)pθ(z). By rear-

ranging the above equation, we have:

log pθ(x) − DKL(qφ(z | x) (cid:107) pθ(z | x))
= Ez∼qφ(z | x) log pθ(x | z) − DKL(qφ(z | x) (cid:107) pθ(z))

(2)

The left-hand-side of Equation (2) allows us to max-
imise the (log-)likelihood of generating real data, i.e.
log pθ(x), while minimising the diﬀerence between the
real and estimated posterior distributions. Note that
pθ(x) is ﬁxed with respect to qφ(z | x). The negative of
the left-hand-side in Equation (2) is deﬁned as the Evi-
dence Lower Bound (ELBO) loss function:

LELBO(θ, φ) = − Ez∼qφ(z | x) log pθ(x | z)
+ DKL(qφ(z | x) (cid:107) pθ(z)).

(3)

The optimal parameters are obtained by solving the

following minimisation problem:

(θ∗, φ∗) = arg min
θ,φ

LELBO(θ, φ).

Being the reverse KL divergence always non-negative,
-LELBO is the lower bound of log pθ(x): this explains
why the minimisation of the LELBO loss implies the
maximisation of the probability of generating real data
samples pθ(x). Indeed, from Equation (2) we have:

−LELBO = log pθ(x) − DKL(qφ(z | x) (cid:107) pθ(z | x))

≤ log pθ(x).

6.2. Derivation of the KL divergence

The KL divergence in Equation (3) is a regulariser
because it is a constraint on the form of the approxi-
mate posterior [97]. In general, the KL divergence of
two multivariate Gaussian distributions qφ and pθ (of
dimension n), i.e. qφ = N(µφ, σφ) and pθ = N(µθ, σθ),
can be expressed in the following form:

DKL(qφ || pθ) = 1

In VAE, qφ is the encoder distribution deﬁned
= N(z | µ(x), σ(x)) where σ
=
as qφ(z | x)
diag(σ2
n) while pθ is the latent prior given by
pθ(z) = N(0, I). Thus, from Equation (4) the reverse

KL divergence DKL(qφ(z | x) (cid:107) pθ(z)) is expressed as:

6.3. Reconstruction loss

The expectation in Equation (3) is a reconstruction
loss. In our scenario, similar to a semantic segmenta-
tion problem with labels 0 and 1 due to the black-white
nature of the data, it makes sense to use a sigmoid cross-
entropy with logits energy term as reconstruction loss
Lc(x, x), of the form

−x · log(sig(x)) − (1 − x) · log(1 − sig(x)),

where sig is the sigmoid function, reformulated for nu-
merical stability and for avoiding overﬂows5 as

Lc(x, x) = max(x, 0) − x · z + log (cid:0)1 + exp (cid:0)−|x|(cid:1)(cid:1) . (6)

6.4. Reparametrisation trick

The expectation term in Equation (3) requires gener-
ating samples from the latent space qφ(z | x). However,
the sampling is a stochastic process, making impossi-
ble to backpropagating the gradient. The reparameteri-
sation trick proposed in [38] (based on methods already
introduced in [98, 99]) allows to overcome such diﬃcul-
ties by means of rewriting z as a sum of a deterministic
part plus an independent random variable ε ∼ N(0, I):

z = µ + σ (cid:12) ε,

(7)

where (cid:12) refers to element-wise product. With this trick
in place, the mean µ and the variance σ of the distribu-
tion are now learnable parameters.
