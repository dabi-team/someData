ABSTRACT

1 INTRODUCTION

The existing deep learning (DL)-based automated program repair
(APR) models are limited in fixing general software defects. We
present DEAR, a DL-based approach that supports fixing for the
general bugs that require dependent changes at once to one or mul-
tiple consecutive statements in one or multiple hunks of code. We
first design a novel fault localization (FL) technique for multi-hunk,
multi-statement fixes that combines traditional spectrum-based (SB)
FL with deep learning and data-flow analysis. It takes the buggy
statements returned by the SBFL model, detects the buggy hunks
to be fixed at once, and expands a buggy statement 𝑠 in a hunk to
include other suspicious statements around 𝑠. We design a two-tier,
tree-based LSTM model that incorporates cycle training and uses a
divide-and-conquer strategy to learn proper code transformations
for fixing multiple statements in the suitable fixing context consist-
ing of surrounding subtrees. We conducted several experiments to
evaluate DEAR on three datasets: Defects4J (395 bugs), BigFix (+26k
bugs), and CPatMiner (+44k bugs). On Defects4J dataset, DEAR
outperforms the baselines from 42%–683% in terms of the number
of auto-fixed bugs with only the top-1 patches. On BigFix dataset,
it fixes 31–145 more bugs than existing DL-based APR models with
the top-1 patches. On CPatMiner dataset, among 667 fixed bugs,
there are 169 (25.3%) multi-hunk/multi-statement bugs. DEAR fixes
71 and 164 more bugs, including 52 and 61 more multi-hunk/multi-
statement bugs, than the state-of-the-art, DL-based APR models.

Researchers have proposed several approaches to help developers
in automatically identifying and fixing the defects in software. Such
approaches are referred to as automated program repair (APR). The
APR approaches have been leveraging various techniques in the
areas of search-based software engineering, software mining, machine
learning (ML), and deep learning (DL).

For search-based approaches [9, 10, 24, 30], a search strategy is per-
formed in the space of potential solutions produced by mutating the
buggy code via operators. Other approaches use software mining to
mine and learn fixing patterns from prior bug fixes [15, 17, 19, 20, 27]
or similar code [28, 32]. Fixing patterns are at the source code level
[19, 20] or at the change level [13, 16, 40]. Machine learning has been
used to mine fixing patterns and the candidate fixes are ranked ac-
cording to their likelihoods [21, 22, 33]. While some DL-based APR
approaches learn similar fixes [11, 41, 42], other ones use machine
translation or neural network models with various code abstrac-
tions to generate patches [5, 6, 12, 18, 35, 38, 39].

Despite their successes, the state-of-the-art DL-based APR ap-
proaches are still limited in fixing the general defects, which involve
the fixing changes to multiple statements in the same or different
parts of a file or different files (which are referred to as hunks). None
of existing DL-based approaches can automatically fix the bug(s)
with dependent changes to multiple statements in multiple hunks
at once. They supports fixing only individual statements. If we use
such a tool on the current statement, the tool treats that statement
as incorrect and treats the other statements as correct. This does
not hold since to fix the current statement, the remaining unfixed
statements must not be treated as correct code. Thus, it might be in-
accurate when using existing DL-based APR tools to fix individual
statements for multi-hunk/multi-statement bugs. While DL pro-
vides benefits for fix learning, this limitation makes the DL-based
APR approaches less capable than the other directions (search-based
and pattern-based APR), which support multiple-statement fixes.
In this paper, we aim to advance deep learning-based APR by in-
troducing DEAR, a DL-based model that supports fixing for the
general bugs with dependent changes at once to one or multiple buggy
statements belonging to one or multiple buggy hunks of code. To do
that, we make the following key technical contributions.

First, we develop a fault localization (FL) technique for multi-hunk,
multi-statement bugs that combines traditional spectrum-based FL
(SBFL) with DL and data-flow analysis. DEAR uses a SBFL method to
identify the ranked list of suspicious buggy statements. Then, it uses
that list of buggy statements to derive the buggy hunks that need
to be fixed together by fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model [8],
to learn the fixing-together relationships among statements. We
also design an expansion algorithm that takes a buggy statement

𝑠 in a hunk as a seed, and expands to include other suspicious
consecutive statements around 𝑠. To achieve that, we use an RNN
model to classify the statements as buggy or not, and use data-flow
analysis for adjustment and then form the buggy hunks.

Second, after the expansion step, we have identified all the buggy
hunk(s) with buggy statement(s). We develop a compositional ap-
proach to learning and then generating multi-hunk, multi-statement
fixes. In our approach, from the buggy statements, we use a divide-
and-conquer strategy to learn each subtree transformation in Ab-
stract Syntax Tree (AST). Specifically, we use an AST-based differ-
encing technique to derive the fine-grained, AST-based changes
and the mappings between buggy and fixed code in the training
data. Those fine-grained subtree mappings help our model avoid
incorrect alignments of buggy and fixed code, thus, is more accurate
in learning multiple AST subtree transformations of a fix.

Third, we have enhanced and orchestrated a tree-based, two-
layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model [18] with an atten-
tion layer and a cycle training to help DEAR to learn the proper
code fixing changes in the suitable context of surrounding code.
For each buggy AST subtree identified by our fault localization, we
encode it as a vector representation and apply that LSTM model to
derive the fixed code. In the first layer, it learns the fixing context,
i.e., the code structures surrounding a buggy AST subtree. In the
second layer, it learns the code transformations to fix that buggy
subtree using the context as an additional weight.

Finally, there might be likely multiple buggy subtrees. To build
the surrounding context for each buggy subtree 𝐵, in training, we
include the AST subtrees after the fixes of the other buggy subtrees
(rather than those buggy subtrees themselves). The rationale is that
the subtrees after fixes actually represent the correct surrounding
code for 𝐵. (Note: in training, the fixed subtrees are known).

We conducted experiments to evaluate DEAR on three large
datasets: Defects4J [1] (395 bugs), BigFix [18] (+26k bugs), and CPat-
Miner dataset [26] (+44k bugs). The baseline DL-based approaches
include DLFix [18], CoCoNuT [23], SequenceR [6], Tufano19 [38],
CODIT [5], and CURE [14]. DEAR fixes 31% (i.e., +11), 5.6% (i.e., +41),
and 9.3% (i.e., +31) more bugs than the best-performing baseline
CURE on all three datasets, respectively, using only Top-1 patches
and with seven times fewer training parameters on average. On
Defects4J, it outperforms those baselines from 42%–683% in terms
of the number of fixed bugs. On BigFix, it fixes 31–145 more bugs
than those baselines with the top-1 patches. On CPatMiner, among
667 fixed bugs from DEAR, there are 169 (25.3%) multi-hunk/multi-
statement ones. DEAR fixes 71, 164, and 41 more bugs, including
52, 61, and 40 more multi-hunk/multi-statement bugs, than existing
DL-based APR tools CoCoNuT, DLFix, and CURE. We also com-
pared DEAR against 8 state-of-the-art pattern-based APR tools. Our
results show that DEAR generates comparable and complementary
results to the top pattern-based APR tools. On Defects4J, DEAR
fixes 12 bugs (out of 47) including 7 multi-hunk/multi-statement
bugs that the top pattern-based APR tool could not fix.
In brief, the key contributions of this paper include

hunk/multi-statement fixes: DEAR advances DL-based APR for

rable and complementary results as other APR directions.

2 MOTIVATION
2.1 Motivating Example

Let us present a bug-fixing example and our observations for mo-
tivation. Figure 1 shows an example of a bug in verifyUserInfo, which
verifies the given user ID, password and Social Security Number
against users’ records in the database. This bug manifests in three
folds. First, the developer forgot to handle the case when UID is null.
Thus, for fixing, (s)he added an else branch at the lines 7–9. Second,
the developer forgot to perform the uppercase conversion for the
UID, causing an error because the records for user IDs in the database
all have capital letters. The corresponding bug-fixing change is the
addition of the call to toUpperCase() on UID at line 6. Third, because
the passwords stored in the database are encoded via hashing, the
input password from a user needs to be hashed before it is compared
against the one in the database. Thus, the developer added the call
to passwordHash() on password before calling the method compare() at
line 11. From this example, we have the following observations:

Observation 1 [A Fix with Dependent Changes to Multiple
Statements]: This bug requires the dependent fixing changes to
multiple statements at once in the same fix: 1) adding the else branch
with the return statement (lines 7–9), 2) adding toUpperCase at line
6, and 3) adding passwordHash at line 11. Making changes to the
individual statements one at a time would not fix the bug since both
the given arguments UID and password need to be properly processed.
UID needs to be null checked and capitalized, and password needs to
be hashed. Those dependent changes to multiple statements must
occur at once in the same fix for the program to pass the test cases.

DEAR: A Novel Deep Learning-based Approach for Automated Program Repair

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

The state-of-the-art DL-based APR approaches [6, 18] fix one
individual statement at a time. In Figure 1, the fault localization
tool returns two buggy lines: line 5 and line 10. Assume that such a
DL-based APR tool is used to fix the statement at line 5. It will make
the fixing change to the statement at line 5 (e.g., modify line 5 and
add lines 7–9), however, with the assumption that the statement at
line 10 and other lines are correct. With this incorrect assumption,
such a fix will not make the code pass the test cases since both
changes must be made. Thus, the individual-statement, DL-based
APR tools cannot fix this bug by fixing one buggy statement at a
time. In general, a bug might require dependent changes to multiple
statements (in possibly multiple hunks) in the same fix.

Moreover, the pattern-based APR tools might not be able to fix
this defect because the code in this example is project-specific and
might not match with any bug-fixing patterns.

Observation 2 [Many-to-Many AST Subtree Transforma-
tions]: A fix can involve the changes to multiple subtrees. For ex-
ample, the if statement has a new else branch. The argument of
the call to getPassword() was modified into the call to toUpperCase().
This fix also involves many-to-many subtree transformations. In this
example, a fix transforms the two buggy statements (line 5 and
line 10), into four statements (the if statement having new else
branch, the return statement at line 8, the modified statement with
toUpperCase at line 6, and the modified statement with passwordHash at
line 11). Thus, a fix can be broken into multiple subtree transforma-
tions, and if using a composition approach with a divide-and-conquer
strategy, we can learn the individual transformations.

Observation 3 [Correct Fixing Context]: A bug fix often de-
pends on the context of surrounding code. For example, to get the
password from a given UID, one needs to capitalize the ID, thus, in
correct code, the method call to toUpperCase is likely to appear when
the method call to getPassword is made. Therefore, building correct
fixing context is important. In Figure 1, a model needs to learn the fix
(line 5 → line 6) w.r.t. surrounding code, which needs to include the
fixed code at line 11 (rather line 10 because line 10 is buggy). To fix
line 5, the correct context must include passwordHash at line 11. Thus,
the correct context for a fix to a buggy statement must include the
fixed code of another buggy statement 𝑠’, rather than 𝑠’ itself.

2.2 Key Ideas

From the observations, we draw the following key ideas:
Key Idea 1. A Fault Localization Method for Multi-hunk, Multi-
statement Patches: From Observation 1, we design a novel FL
method that combines traditional spectrum-based FL (SBFL) with DL
and data-flow analysis. We use a SBFL to obtain a ranked list of can-
didate statements to be fixed with their suspiciousness scores. We
extend the result from SBFL in two tasks. First, we design a hunk-
detection algorithm to use DL to detect the hunks that need to be
dependently changed together in the same patch, because SBFL tool
returns the suspicious candidates for the fault, but not necessarily
to be fixed together. Second, we design an expansion algorithm
that takes each of those detected fixing-together hunks and ex-
pands it to include consecutive suspicious statements in the hunk.
In Figure 1, the SBFL tool returns line 5 as suspicious. After hunk de-
tection, DEAR uses data dependencies via variable retrieve_password
to include the statement at line 10 as to be fixed as well.

Key Idea 2. A Compositional Approach to Learning and Gen-
erating Multi-hunk, Multi-statement Fixes:

Divide-and-Conquer Strategy in Learning Multi-hunk/Multi-stmt
Fixes. To auto-fix a bug with multiple statements, a tool needs to
make 𝑚-to-𝑛 statement changes, i.e., 𝑚 statements might generally
become 𝑛 statements after the fix. A naive approach would let a
model learn the code structure changes and make the alignment
between the code before and after the fix. Because a fix involves
multiple subtree transformations (Observation 2), during training,
a model might incorrectly align the code before and after the fix,
thus, leading to incorrect learning of the fix. For example, with-
out this step, the model might map retrieved_password at line 10 to
the same variable at line 6 (the correct map is line 11). Thus, to
facilitate learning bug-fixing code transformations, during training,
we use a divide-and-conquer strategy. We integrate into DEAR a
fine-grained AST-based change detection model to map the ASTs
before and after the fix. Such mappings enable DEAR to learn the
more local fixing changes to subtrees. For example, the fine-grained
AST change detection can derive that the statements at lines 4–5,
and 7 become the statements at lines 4, and 6–9; and the statement
at line 10 becomes the one at line 11. We can break them into two
groups and align the respective AST subtrees for DEAR to learn.

Compositional Approach in Fixing Multiple Subtrees. We support
the fixes having multiple statements in one or multiple hunks
by enhancing the design and orchestration of a tree-based LSTM
model [18] to add an attention layer and cycle training (Section 3.3).
While that model fixes one subtree at a time, we need to enhance it
to fix multiple AST subtrees at once.

Specifically, we modify its operations in the two-layers to con-
sider multiple buggy subtrees at once. For example, during training,
we mark each of the AST subtrees of the statements at line 5 and
line 10 before the fix as buggy. At the first layer, for each subtree for
a buggy statement, we replace it with a pseudo-node, and consider
the new AST with its (pseudo-)nodes as the fixing context for the
buggy statement. The pseudo-node is computed via an embedding
technique to capture the structure of the buggy statement (Sec-
tion 3.2). At the second layer, DEAR learns the transformation from
the subtree for the statement at line 5 into the subtree for the fixed
statements at the lines 6–9. The vector for the fixing context learned
from the first layer is used as a weight in the code transformation
learning in the second layer. We repeat the same process for every
buggy statement. For fixing, we perform the composition of the
fixing transformations for all buggy statements at once.
Key Idea 3. Transformation Learning with Correct Surround-
ing Fixing Context: To learn the correct context for a fix to a
statement, we need to train the model with the fixed versions of the
other buggy statements (Observation 3). For example, for training,
to learn the fix to the statement at line 5 with toUpperCase, a model
needs to integrate the fixed version of the other buggy line, i.e., the
code at line 11 with passwordHash as the fixing context (instead of the
buggy line 10). If the surrounding code before the fix is used (i.e.,
line 10), the model will learn the incorrect context to fix the line 5.

2.3 Approach Overview
2.3.1 Training Process. The input for training includes the source
code before and after a fix (Figure 2), which is parsed into ASTs.

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

Figure 2: Training Process Overview

The output includes the two trained models for context learning and
for tree transformation learning (fixing). The context learning model
(CTL) aims to learn the weights (representing the impact of the
context) to make an adjustment to the tree transformation learning
result. The tree transformation learning model (TTL) aims to learn
code transformation for the fix to a buggy AST subtree.

Context Learning (Sections 3.2–3.3). The first step is to build
the before-/after-fixing contexts for training. With divide-and-conquer
strategy, we use CPatMiner [26] to derive the changed, inserted, and
removed subtrees (key idea 2). As a result, the AST subtrees for the
buggy statements are mapped to the respective fixed subtrees. For
each buggy subtree and respective fixed subtree, we build two ASTs
of the entire method as contexts, one before and one after the fix,
and use both of them for training at the input layer and the output
layer of the tree-based LSTM context learning model (Section 3.3).
To build the correct context for each buggy subtree, we leverage
key idea 3: we train our model with the fixed versions of the other
buggy subtrees. Finally, the vectors computed from this learning
are used as the weights in tree transformation learning.

Tree Transformation Learning (Section 3.4). We first use CPat-
Miner [26] to derive the subtree mappings. To learn bug-fixing tree
transformations, each buggy subtree 𝑇 itself and its fixed subtree
𝑇 ′ after the fix are used at the input layer and the output layer
of the second tree-based LSTM for training. Moreover, the weight
representing the context computed as the vector in the context
learning model is used an additional input in this step.

2.3.2 Fixing Process. Figure 3 illustrates the fixing process. The
input includes the buggy source code and the set of test cases.

Fault Localization and Buggy-Hunk Detection (Section 4.1).
From key idea 1, we first use a SBFL tool to locate buggy statements
with suspiciousness scores. Hunk detection algorithm uses those
statements to derive the buggy hunks that need to be fixed together.
Multi-Statement Expansion (Section 4.2). Because SBFL might
return one statement for a hunk, we aim to expand to potentially
include more consecutive buggy statements. To do so, we combine
RNN [7] and data-flow analysis to detect more buggy statements.
Tree-based Code Repair (Section 4.3). For the detected buggy
statements from multi-statement expansion, we use key idea 2 to de-
rive fixes to multiple buggy subtrees at once. For a buggy subtree 𝑇 ,
we build the AST of the method as the context, and use it as the
input of the trained context learning model (CTL) to produce the
weight representing the impact of the context. The buggy subtree 𝑇
is used as the input of the trained tree transformation model (TTL)
to produce the context-free fixed subtree 𝑇 ′. Finally, that weight is
used to adjust 𝑇 ′ into the fixed subtree 𝑇 ′′ for a candidate patch.
We apply grammatical rules and program analysis on the current
candidate code to produce the fixed code. We re-rank and validate
the fixed code using test cases in the same manner as in DLFix [18].

Figure 3: Fixing Process Overview

3 TRAINING PROCESS
3.1 Pairing Buggy and Fixed Subtrees

The training data contains the pairs of the source code of the meth-
ods before and after the fixes. Note that a fix might involve multiple
methods. Instead of pairing the entire buggy method with the fixed
one, we use a divide-and-conquer strategy to help the model to
better learn the fixing transformations in the proper contexts. First,
we use the CPatMiner tool [26] to derive the fixing changes.

If a subtree corresponds to a statement, we call it statement
subtree. From the result of CPatMiner, we use the following rules
to pair the buggy subtrees with the corresponding fixed subtrees:
1. A buggy subtree (𝑆-subtree) is a subtree with update or delete.
2. If a 𝑆-subtree is deleted, we pair it with an empty tree.
3. If a buggy 𝑆-subtree is marked as update, (i.e, it is updated or
its children node(s) could be inserted, deleted or updated), we paired
this buggy 𝑆-subtree with its corresponding fixed 𝑆-subtree.

4. If a 𝑆-subtree is inserted and its parent node is another 𝑆-
subtree, we pair it with that parent 𝑆-subtree. If the parent node
is not an 𝑆-subtree, we pair an empty tree to the corresponding
inserted 𝑆-subtree.

3.2 Context Building

Figure 4 illustrates our context building process. For each pair of
the buggy AST 𝐼1 and fixed AST 𝑂1 (Section 3.1), we perform alpha-
renaming on the variables. In Step 1, we encode each AST node
with the vector using the word embedding model GloVe [29] (which
captures well code structure) by considering a statement node as a
sentence and each code token as a word. We use those vectors to
label the AST nodes in 𝐼1 and 𝑂1. The ASTs after this step are the
vectorized ASTs 𝐼2 and 𝑂2, before and after the fix.

In Step 2, we process each pair of the buggy 𝑆-subtree 𝑇𝑏 in 𝐼2 and
the corresponding fixed 𝑆-subtree 𝑇𝑓 in 𝑂2. First, we perform node
summarization on 𝑇𝑏 and 𝑇𝑓 by using TreeCaps [4] to capture the
tree structures of 𝑇𝑏 and 𝑇𝑓 into 𝑉𝑠 and 𝑉 ′
𝑠 , respectively. Second, for
each of the other buggy 𝑆-subtrees, e.g., 𝑇 ′
𝑏 , and their corresponding
fixed 𝑆-subtrees, e.g., 𝑇 ′
𝑓 is the
fixed version of 𝑇 ′
𝑓 in the building of the
resulting context 𝐼3 before fixing (key idea 3). That is, we replace
each of the other buggy subtrees with its fixed version. However,
to build the resulting context 𝑂3 after fixing, we keep 𝑇 ′
𝑓 because it
is the fixed subtree, thus, providing the correct context.

𝑓 , we process as follows. Because 𝑇 ′

𝑏 , we replace 𝑇 ′

𝑏 with 𝑇 ′

The resulting AST, 𝐼3, is used as the before-the-fix context for
the buggy 𝑆-subtree 𝑇𝑏 and used at the input layer of the encoder
in the context learning model (CTL). The resulting AST, 𝑂3, is used
as the after-the-fix context for 𝑇𝑓 and used at the output layer of
the decoder in CTL (Figure 4). Finally, the vectors 𝑉𝑠 and 𝑉 ′
𝑠 will be
used as the weighting inputs for tree transformation learning later.

Figure 5: Cycle Training in Attention-based Tree-based
LSTM

3.3 Context Learning via Tree-based LSTM

with Attention Layer and Cycle Training

For context learning and tree transformation learning, we enhance
the two-layer, tree-based, LSTM models in DLFix [18] with attention
layer and cycle training. We have added an attention layer into that
model, which now has 3 layers: encoder layer, decoder layer and
attention layer (Figure 5). For the encoder and decoder, to learn the
fixing context expressed in ASTs, we use Child-Sum Tree-based
LSTM [36]. Unlike the regular LSTM that loops for each time step,
this model loops for each subtree to capture structures.

We also use cycle training [45] for further improvement. Cycle
training aims to help a model learn better the mapping between the
input and output by continuing to train and re-train to emphasize on
the mapping between them. This is helpful in the situations in which
a buggy code can be fixed in multiple ways into different fixed code,
or multiple buggy code can be fixed into one fixed code. This makes
the regular tree-based LSTM less accurate. With cycle training, the
pair of an input and the most likely output is emphasized to reduce
the noise of such one-to-many or many-to-one relations.

Cycle training occurs between encoder and decoder. We use the
forward mapping 𝑀: 𝐴 → 𝐵 to denote the process of 𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟 →
𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 → 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟 , and the backward mapping 𝑁 : 𝐵 → 𝐴 to
denote the process of 𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟 → 𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 → 𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟 (Figure 5).
We apply the adversarial losses for both 𝑀 and 𝑁 to get the two
loss functions 𝐿𝑟𝑢𝑛 (𝑀, 𝐷𝐵, 𝐴, 𝐵) and 𝐿𝑟𝑢𝑛 (𝑁 , 𝐷𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐴). The differ-
ence between 𝑁 (𝑀 (𝐴)) and 𝐴, and that between 𝑀 (𝑁 (𝐵)) and 𝐵
are used to generate cycle-consistency loss 𝐿𝑐𝑦𝑐 (𝑀, 𝑁 ) for 𝑀 and
𝑁 to ensure the learned mapping functions are cycle-consistent.
Mathematically, we have two loss functions 𝐿𝑟𝑢𝑛 (𝑀, 𝐷𝐵, 𝐴, 𝐵) and
𝐿𝑟𝑢𝑛 (𝑁 , 𝐷𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐴). With the incentive cycle consistency loss 𝐿𝑐𝑦𝑐 (𝑀,
𝑁 ), the overall loss function is computed as follows:

Where 𝐿(𝑀, 𝑁 , 𝐷𝑎, 𝐷𝑏 ) is the loss function for the entire cycle

𝑁 (𝑀 (𝐴)) and the real result 𝐴; 𝐷𝐵 is aimed to distinguish between
the predicted result 𝑀 (𝑁 (𝐵)) and the real result 𝐵; 𝐿𝑟𝑢𝑛 is the cycle
consistency loss function for the running function 𝑀, 𝑁 ; 𝐿𝑐𝑦𝑐 is
the incentivized cycle consistency loss; and 𝛼 is the parameter to
control the relative importance of the two objectives.

3.4 Tree Transformation Learning

Figure 6 illustrates the tree transformation learning process. We
use the same tree-based LSTM model with attention layer and cycle
training as in Section 3.3 to learn the code transformation for each
buggy 𝑆-subtree 𝑇𝑏 . In Step 1, we build the word embeddings for
all the code tokens as in Section 3.2. Each AST node in the buggy
𝑆-subtree (𝑇𝑏 ) and the fixed one (𝑇𝑓 ) is labeled with its vector rep-
resentation (Figure 6). Next, we use the summarized vectors 𝑉𝑠 and
𝑉 ′
𝑠 computed from context learning in Figure 4 as the weights and
perform cross-product for each vector of the node in the buggy
𝑆-subtree 𝑇𝑏 and for each one in the fixed 𝑆-subtree 𝑇𝑓 , respectively.
The two resulting subtrees after cross-product are used at the input
and output layers of the tree-based LSTM model for tree transfor-
mation learning. We use cross-product because we aim to have a
vector as the label for a node and use it as a weight representing
the context to learn code transformations for bug fixes.

4 FIXING PROCESS
4.1 Fixing-together Hunk Detection Algorithm

The first step of fixing multi-hunk, multi-statement bugs is for our
FL method to detect buggy hunk(s) that are fixed together in the
same patch. To do that, we fine-tune Google’s pre-trained BERT
model [8] to learn the fixing-together relationships among statements
using BERT’s sentence-pair classification task. Then, we use the
fine-tuned BERT model in an algorithm to detect fixing-together
hunks. Let us explain our hunk detection algorithm in details.

4.1.1 Fine-tuning BERT to Learn Fixing-together Relation-
ships among Statements. We first fine-tune BERT to learn if two
statements are needed to be fixed together or not. Let 𝐻 be a set
of the hunks that are fixed together for a bug. The input for the
training process is all the sets 𝐻 s for all the bugs in the training set.

𝐿𝑐𝑦𝑐 (𝑀, 𝑁 ) = 𝐸𝑏∼𝑝𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 (𝑏) [||𝑁 (𝑀 (𝑎)) − 𝑎||1]
+ 𝐸𝑎∼𝑝𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 (𝑎) [||𝑀 (𝑁 (𝑏)) − 𝑏 ||1]

(1)

Step 1. For a pair of hunks 𝐻𝑖 and 𝐻 𝑗 in 𝐻 , we take every pair of
statements 𝑆𝑘 and 𝑆𝑙 , one from each hunk, and build the vectors

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

Yi Li, Shaohua Wang, and Tien N. Nguyen

with BERT. We consider the pair of statements (𝑆𝑘 , 𝑆𝑙 ) as being
fixed-together in the same patch to fine-tune BERT.
Step 2. Step 1 is repeated for all the pairs of the statements (𝑆𝑘 , 𝑆𝑙 )s
in all the pairs 𝐻𝑖 and 𝐻 𝑗 in 𝐻 . We also repeat Step 1 for all 𝐻 s. We
use them to fine-tune the BERT model to learn the fixing-together
relationships among any two statements in all pairs of hunks.
4.1.2 Using Fine-tuned BERT for Hunk Detection. After ob-
taining the fine-tuned BERT, we use it in determining whether the
hunks of code need to be fixed together or not. The input of of
this procedure is the fine-tuned BERT model, buggy code 𝑃, and
test cases. The output is the groups of hunks that need to be fixed
together. The process is conducted in the following steps.

Step 1. We use a spectrum-based FL tool (in our experiment, we
used Ochiai [3]) to run on the given source code and test cases. It
returns the list of buggy statements and suspiciousness scores.

Step 2. The consecutive statements within a method returned by
the FL tool are grouped together to form the hunks 𝐻1, 𝐻2, ..., 𝐻𝑚.
Step 3. To decide if a pair of hunks (𝐻𝑖 ,𝐻 𝑗 ) needs to be fixed to-
gether, we use the BERT model that was fine-tuned. Specifically,
for every pair of statements (𝑆𝑘 ,𝑆𝑙 ), one from each hunk (𝐻𝑖 ,𝐻 𝑗 ),
we use the fine-tuned BERT to measure the fixing-together rela-
tionship score for (𝑆𝑘 ,𝑆𝑙 ). The fixing-together score between 𝐻𝑖 and
𝐻 𝑗 is the average of the scores of all the pairs of statements within
𝐻𝑖 and 𝐻 𝑗 , respectively. If the average score for all the statement
pairs is higher than a threshold, we consider (𝐻𝑖 ,𝐻 𝑗 ) as needed to
be fixed together. From the pairs of the detected hunks, we build
the groups of the fixing-together hunks. The group of hunks that
has any statement with the highest Ochiai’s suspiciousness score
will be ranked and fixed first. The rationale is that such a group
contains the most suspicious statement, thus, should be fixed first.

4.2 Multiple-Statement Expansion Algorithm

A detected buggy hunk from the algorithm in Section 4.1 might
contain only one statement since each of those suspicious state-
ments is originally derived by a SBFL tool, which does not focus
on detecting consecutive buggy statements in a hunk. Thus, in this
step, we take the result from the hunk detection algorithm, and
expand it to include potentially more statements in a hunk.

Key Idea. Our idea is to combine deep learning with data flow anal-
ysis. We first train an RNN model with GRU cells [7] (will be ex-
plained in Section 4.2.2) to learn to decide whether a statement is
buggy or not. We collect the training data for that model from the
real buggy statements. We then use data-flow analysis to adjust the
result. Specifically, if a statement is labeled as buggy by the RNN
model, no adjustment is needed. However, even when the RNN
model decides a given statement 𝑠 as non-buggy, and if 𝑠 has a data
dependency with a buggy statement, we still mark 𝑠 as buggy.
4.2.1 Expansion Algorithm. The input of Multi-Statement Expan-
sion algorithm is the buggy statement buggyS, i.e., the seed statement
of a hunk. The output is a buggy hunk of consecutive statements.
First, it produces a candidate list of buggy statements by includ-
ing 𝑁 statements before and 𝑁 statements after buggyS (Expand2N-
CandidatesList at line 2). In the current implementation, 𝑁 =5. Then,

𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑆𝑡𝑚𝑡𝑠 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑2𝑁𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠𝐿𝑖𝑠𝑡 (𝑏𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑦𝑆)
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑙𝑡 = 𝑅𝑁 𝑁𝐶𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖 𝑓 𝑖𝑒𝑟 (𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑆𝑡𝑚𝑡𝑠)

Figure 7: Multiple-Statement Expansion Example

it uses the RNN model to act as a classifier to predict whether each
statement (except buggyS) in the candidate list is buggy or not (RN-
NClassifier at line 3). To train that RNN model, we use the buggy
statements in the buggy hunks in the training data (see Section 4.2.2).
TreeCaps [4] is used to encode the statements.

In DataDepAnalysis (line 4), to adjust the results from the RNN
model, we obtain buggyHunk surrounding the buggy statement
buggyS, consisting of the statements before and after buggyS, that were
predicted as buggy by the RNN model (line 7). We then examine
statement-by-statement in the upward direction from the center
buggy statement in the candidate list (line 8, via TopHalf) and in the
downward direction (line 9, via BotHalf). In DDExpandHunk, we con-
tinue to expand (upward or downward) the current buggy hunk bug-
gyHunk to include a statement that is deemed as buggy by the RNN
model or has a data dependency with the center buggy statement
buggyS (lines 13–14). We stop the process (upward or downward),
if we encounter a non-buggy statement without data dependency
with buggyS or we exhaust the list (line 15). Finally, the buggy hunk
containing consecutive buggy statements is returned.

In Figure 7, the SBFL tool returns the buggy statement at line 4.
All statements are encoded into the sets of vectors via GloVe [29]
and classified by the RNN model. We expand from the statement
at line 4 upward to include line 3 (even though the RNN model
predicted it as non-buggy), since line 3 has a data dependency with
the buggy statement at line 4 via the variable c. We include line 5
because the RNN model predicts the line 5 as buggy. At this time, we
stop the upward and downward directions because we encounter
the non-buggy statements at lines 2 and 6 that do not have data
dependency with line 4. That is, lines 1–2 and 6–7 are excluded. The
final result includes the statements at lines 3–5 as the buggy hunk.

4.2.2 Buggy Statement Prediction with RNN. We present how
to use an GRU-based RNN model [7] to predict a buggy statement.

Training. To train the RNN model, we use the buggy/non-buggy
statements in all the hunks in the training dataset. We use GloVe [29]

DEAR: A Novel Deep Learning-based Approach for Automated Program Repair

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

to encode each token in a statement so that a statement is repre-
sented by a sequence of token vectors. We use the neural archi-
tecture of the GRU-based RNN model [7] to consume the GloVe
vectors of statements associated with the buggy/non-buggy labels.
The RNN model operates in the time steps. At the time step 𝑘
(𝑘>=1), at the input layer, GRU consumes the GloVe vectors of the
𝑘𝑡ℎ statement 𝑆𝑘 . At the output layer, 𝑆𝑘 is labeled as 1 if it is a
buggy statement and as 0 otherwise. In addition to the input at the
time step 𝑘 + 1, we feed the output of the time step 𝑘 to the GRU.

Prediction. The trained GRU-based RNN model is used in Expansion
Algorithm at line 3 to predict if a statement in the hunk is buggy
or not. The model takes a statement in the form of GloVe token
vectors. It takes the vectors of all the statements in a hunk and
labels them as buggy or non-buggy in multiple-time-step manner.

4.3 Tree-based Code Repair

Figure 8 illustrates this process. After deriving the buggy hunk(s)
in the method(s), DEAR performs code repairing for all buggy
statements in all the hunks at once using the trained LSTM models.
The tree-based code repair is conducted in the following steps:

Step 1. Identifying buggy S-subtrees. For each hunk, we parse the
code into AST, and identify the buggy 𝑆-subtrees corresponding to
the derived buggy statements. In Figure 8, the 𝑆-subtrees 𝑇1 and
𝑇2 are identified as buggy. If a buggy 𝑆-subtree is part of another
larger buggy 𝑆-subtree, we just need to perform fixing on the larger
𝑆-subtree since that fix also fixes the smaller 𝑆-subtree.

Step 2. Embedding and Summarization. We perform word embed-
ding using GloVe [29] and tree summarization using TreeCaps [4]
on all the buggy subtrees to obtain the contexts. For example, in
Figure 8, 𝑇1 and 𝑇2 are summarized into two vectors 𝑉1 and 𝑉2.

Step 3. Predict Context. We use the trained context learning model
(CTL) to run on the context with the AST nodes including also the
summarized nodes to predict the context. In the resulting AST, the
structure is the same as the AST for the input context, except that
the summarized nodes become the new ones. For example, 𝑉1 and
𝑉2 in the context becomes 𝑉 ′
1 and 𝑉 ′
Step 4. Adding Weights. The weights 𝑉1 and 𝑉2 from Step 2 are used
in a product with the vectors in the buggy subtrees 𝑇1 and 𝑇2. Each
node in 𝑇1 and 𝑇2 is represented by a multiplication vector between
the original vector of the node and the weight vector 𝑉 ′

2 after Step 3.

1 or 𝑉 ′
2 .

1 and 𝑇 ′

Step 5. Predict Transformations. We use the trained tree transfor-
mation learning model to predict the subtrees 𝑇 ′
2 of the fix.
Step 6. Removing Weights. We remove the weight from Step 4 to
obtain the candidate fixed subtree for a buggy one. For example, we
remove 𝑉 ′
2 to obtain the candidate fixed subtrees 𝑇1𝑓 and 𝑇2𝑓 .
However, because we know the cross product and a vector, we can
get the unlimited number of solutions. Thus, to produce a single
solution 𝑇1𝑓 and 𝑇2𝑓 , for each node in 𝑇 ′
2 , we assume that
1 and 𝑉𝑛2 in 𝑇 ′
𝑉 ′
1 and 𝑉 ′
2 .
Then, we can get the unweighted node vector 𝑉 ′
𝑛1 in 𝑇1𝑓 as follows:

2 are vertical with the node vector 𝑉𝑛1 in 𝑇 ′

1 and 𝑇 ′

Figure 8: Tree-based Code Repair

After having the vector for each node in a fixed S-subtree 𝑇1𝑓 ,
we generated candidate patches based on word embedding. For
each node, we calculated the cosine similarity score between its
vector 𝑉 ′
𝑛1 and each vector in the vector list for all tokens. To
generate candidate patches, we select the token 𝑡 in the list. Token
𝑡 has its similarity score 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑡 for one node in the fixed 𝑆-subtree.
By adding all 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑡 for all the tokens, we have the total score,
𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑚, for a candidate. We select the top-5 candidates for each
node to generate the candidates and sort them based on 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑚.

4.4 Post-processing

A naive approach would face combinatorial explosion in forming
the candidate fix(es) because for each node in the sub-tree, we main-
tain top-5 candidates. However, when we combine the candidates
for all the nodes in the fixed sub-tree, many candidates are not
valid for the current method in the project. Therefore, when we
form a candidate by combining all the candidates for the nodes, we
apply a set of filters to verify the program semantics in the same
manner as in DLFix [18]. This allows us to eliminate invalid candi-
dates immediately. Specifically, we use the alpha-renaming filter to
change the names back to the normal Java code using a dictionary
containing all the valid names in the scope, the syntax-checking
filter to remove the candidates with syntax errors, and the name
validation filter to check the validity of the variables, methods, and
classes. Moreover, for further improvement, we use beam search
to maintain only the top-ranked candidate fixes. Thus, we do not
exhaust all compositions in forming the statements. This helps
maintain a manageable number of candidates.

After applying all the filters, we also used DLFix [18]’s re-ranking
scheme on the candidate patches. We then used test cases to conduct
patch validation on those candidates. We verify each patch from the
top to the bottom until a correct patch is identified and the patch
validation ends. If all candidates for fixing a location cannot pass
all the test cases, we select the next location to repeat the process.

5 EMPIRICAL EVALUATION

els on Defects4J benchmark. How well does DEAR perform in
comparison with existing DL-based APR models on Defects4J?

els on Large Bug Datasets. How well does DEAR perform in
comparison with DL-based APR models on large-scale bug datasets?

RQ3. Comparative Study with Pattern-based APR approaches
on Defects4J. How well does DEAR perform in comparison with
the state-of-the-art, pattern-based APR approaches?
RQ4. Sensitivity Analysis of DEAR. How do various factors
affect the overall performance of DEAR in APR?
RQ5. Time Complexity and Model’s Training Parameters. What
is time complexity and the numbers of training parameters?

5.2 Data Collection

We have conducted our empirical evaluation on three datasets:

1) Defects4J v1.2.0 [1] with 395 bugs with test cases;
2) BigFix [18] with +26k bugs in +1.8 million buggy methods;
3) CPatMiner [26] with +44k bugs from 5,832 Java projects.
All experiments were conducted on a workstation with a 8-core

Intel CPU and a single GTX Titan GPU.

5.3 Experimental Methodology
5.3.1 RQ1. Comparison with DL-based APR on Defects4J.
Comparative Baselines. We compare DEAR with five state-of-the-art
DL-based APR models: DLFix [18], CoCoNuT [23], SequenceR [6],
Tufano19 [38], CODIT [5], and CURE [14].

Procedure and Settings. We replicated all DL-based APRs except
CURE, which is unavailable. We re-implemented CURE following
the details in their paper. We trained all DL approaches on the bugs
and fixes in CPatMiner dataset and tested them on all 395 bugs in
Defects4J (no overlap between the two datasets). All DL approaches
were applied with the same fault localization tool, Ochiai [3], and
patch validation with the test cases in Defects4J. Following prior
experiments [13, 18], we set a 5-hour running-time limit for a tool
for patch generation and validation.

We tuned DEAR with the following key hyper-parameters using
the beam-search: (1) BERT for hunk detection: epoch size (e-size)
(2, 3, 4, 5), batch size (b-size) (8, 16, 32, 64), and learning rate (l-rate)
(3𝑒−4, 1𝑒−4, 5𝑒−5, 3𝑒−5, 1𝑒−5); (2) LSTM for Multi-Statement Expan-
sion and code repair: e-size (100, 150, 200, 250), b-size (32, 64, 128, 256),
and l-rate (0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.003, 0.005); (3) GloVe for repre-
sentation vectors: vector size (v-size) (100, 150, 200, 250), l-rate
(0.001, 0.003, 0.005, 0.01), b-size (32, 64, 128, 256), and e-size (100, 150,
200, 250). The other default parameters were used.

The best setting for DEAR is (1) e-size=4, b-size=32, l-rate=1𝑒−4
for BERT; (2) e-size=200, l-rate=0.003, b-size=128 for LSTM; (3) v-
size=200, l-rate=0.001, b-size=64, e-size=200 for GloVe. For other
models, we tuned with the parameters in their papers, e.g., the
vector length of word2vec, learning rate, and epoch size to find
the best parameters for each dataset. We tuned all approaches with
the aforementioned parameters on the same CPatMiner dataset to
obtain the best performance. Once we obtained the best parameters
for each model, we used them for later experiments.

Quantitative Analysis. We report the numbers of bugs that a

model can auto-fix for the following bug-location types:

Type-1. One-Hunk, One-Statement: A bug with the fix in-

volving only one hunk with one single statement.

Type-2. One-Hunk, Multi-Statements: A bug with the fix

involving only one hunk with multiple statements.

Type-3. Multi-Hunks, One-Statement: A bug with the fix

involving multiple hunks; each hunk with one fixed statement.

Type-4. Multi-Hunks, Multi-Statements: A bug with the fix

involving multi-hunks; each hunk has multiple statements.

Type-5. Multi-Hunks, Mix-Statements: A bug with the fix
involving multiple hunks, and some hunks have one statement and
other hunks have multiple statements.

Evaluation Metrics. We report the number of bugs that can be
correctly fixed and the number of plausible patches (i.e., passing all
test cases, but not the actual fixes) using the top candidate patches.

5.3.2 RQ2. Comparison with DL-based APR on Large Datasets.
Comparative Baselines. We compare DEAR with the same baselines
as in RQ1 on two large datasets: BigFix and CPatMiner.

Procedure and Settings. First, we evaluated all DL-based APR mod-
els on BigFix and CPatMiner. Following DLFix and Sequencer, we
randomly split data into 80%/10%/10% for training, tuning, and test-
ing. Second, we have cross-dataset evaluation: training DL-based
approaches on CPatMiner and testing on BigFix, and vice versa. Un-
like Defects4J, BigFix and CPatMiner datasets do not have test cases.
Without test cases, we cannot use fault localization and patch vali-
dation for all DL approaches. Thus, we fed the actual bug locations
into the DL models, including locations on buggy hunks and state-
ments. The DL-based baselines do not distinguish hunks, instead
process each buggy statement at a time. We use developers’ actual
fixes as the ground truth to evaluate the DL-based approaches.

Evaluation Metrics. We use the top-𝐾 metric, defined as the ratio
between the number of times that a correct patch is in a ranked list
of the top 𝐾 candidates over the total number of bugs.

5.3.3 RQ3. Comparison with Pattern-based APR on Defects4J.
Comparative Baselines. We compare DEAR with the state-of-the-
art, pattern-based APR tools on Defects4J: Elixir [33], ssFix [43],
CapGen [40], FixMiner [16], Avatar [19], Hercules [34], Sim-
Fix [13], and Tbar [20]. We were able to replicate the following
pattern-based baselines: Elixir, ssFix, FixMiner, SimFix, TBar
under the same computing environments. We set the time limit to 5
hours for the tools. For the other baselines, due to unavailable code,
we use the results reported in their papers as they were run on the
same dataset. We used the same setting and evaluation metric.

5.3.4 RQ4. Sensitivity Analysis. We evaluate the impacts of dif-
ferent factors on DEAR’s performance. We consider the following:
(1) hunk detection (Hunk); (2) multi-statement expansion (Expan-
sion); (3) multi-statement tree model and cycle training; and (4) data
splitting scheme. We use the left-one-out strategy for each factor.
We evaluate the first three factors on Defects4J and the last one on
CPatMiner since we need a larger dataset for various splitting.

5.3.5 Time Complexity and Numbers of Parameters in Model
Training. We measure the training and fixing time for a model
and its number of parameters for model training on the datasets.

and 2 show the comparison results among DEAR and the baseline
models.

As seen in Table 1, DEAR can auto-fix the most number of bugs
(47) and generate the most number of plausible patches (91) that pass
all test cases on Defects4J. Particularly, DEAR can auto-fix 32, 41, 33,
17, 14, and 11 more bugs than Sequencer, CODIT, Tufano19, DLFix,
CoCoNuT, and CURE, respectively (i.e., 213%, 683%, 236%, 57%, 42%,
and 31% relative improvements). Compared with those tools in that
order on Defects4J, DEAR can auto-fix 35, 34, 41, 18, 31, and 18 bugs
that those tools missed, respectively. Via the overlapping analysis
between the result of DEAR and those of the baselines combined,
DEAR can fix 18 unique bugs that they missed.

Table 2 shows the comparison between DEAR and the top DL-
based baselines (DLFix, CoCoNuT, CURE) w.r.t. different bug types.
For single-hunk bugs (Types 1-2), DEAR fixes 33 bugs including

4 unique single hunk bugs that the other tools missed.

For multi-hunk bugs (Types 3–5), DEAR can fix 14 bugs that
cannot be fixed by DLFix, CoCoNuT, and CURE. Existing DL-based
APR models cannot fix those bugs since the mechanism of fixing
one statement at a time does not work on the bugs that require the
fixes with dependent changes to multiple statements at once. Thus,
they do not produce correct patches for those cases.

For multi-hunk or multi-statement bugs (Types 2–5), DEAR fixes

18 of them (out of 47 fixed bugs, i.e., 38.3% of total fixed bugs).

6.1.2 Without Fault Localization. We also compared DEAR
with other tools in the fixing capabilities without the impact of
a third-party FL tool. All the tools under comparison (Table 3) were
pointed to the correct fixing locations and performed the fixes. As
seen, if the fixing locations are known, DEAR’s fixing capability
is also higher than those baselines (53 bugs versus 44, 40, and 48).
Importantly, it can fix 20 multi-hunk/multi-statement bugs (37.7%
of a total of 53 fixed bugs), while CoCoNuT, DLFix, and CURE can
fix only 7, 5, and 10 such bugs.

DEAR is more general than existing DL-based models because it
can support dependent fixes with multi-hunks or multi-statements.
Importantly, it significantly improves these DL-based models and
raises the DL direction to the same level as the other APR directions
(search-based and pattern-based), which can handle multi-statement
bugs. Moreover, DEAR is fully data-driven and does not require the
defined fixing patterns as in the pattern-based APR models.

6.2 RQ2. Comparison Results with DL-based

APR Models on Large Datasets

Table 4 shows that DEAR can fix more bugs than any DL-based APR
baselines on the two large datasets. Using the top-1 patches, DEAR
can fix 15.1% of the total 4,415 bugs in CPatMiner. It fixes 40–322
more bugs than the baselines with top-1 patches. On BigFix, it can
fix 14.1% of the total 2,594 bugs with the top-1 patches. It can fix
31–145 more bugs than those baselines with the top-1 patches.

Table 5 shows that DEAR also outperformed the baselines in the
cross-dataset setting in which we trained the models on CPatMiner
and tested them on BigFix and vice versa.

Table 6 shows the detailed comparative results on CPatMiner
w.r.t. different bug types. As seen, DEAR can auto-fix more bugs
on every type of bug locations on the two large datasets. Among 667
fixed bugs, DEAR has fixed 169 multi-hunk or multi-stmt bugs of

Types 2–5 (i.e., 25.33% of the total fixed bugs). DEAR fixes more
bugs (71, 164, and 41 more), and fixes more bugs in each bug type
than the baselines CoCoNuT, DLFix, and CURE, respectively.

DEAR fixes 52, 61, and 40 more multi-hunk/multi-stmt bugs, and
20, 104, and 2 more one-hunk/one-stmt bugs than CoCoNuT, DLFix,
and CURE. For the multi-statement bugs (Types 2 and 5) that the
other tools fixed, the fixed statements are independent. This result
shows that fixing each individual statement at a time does not work.

6.3 RQ3. Comparison Results with
Pattern-based APR Models

As seen in Table 7, DEAR performs at the same level in terms of the
number of bugs as the top pattern-based tools Hercules and Tbar.
Table 8 displays the details of the comparison w.r.t. different
bug types. As seen, DEAR fixes 7 Multi/Mix-Statement bugs (Types
2, 4–5) that Hercules missed. Investigating further, we found that
Hercules is designed to fix replicated bugs, i.e., the hunks must
have similar statements. Those 7 bugs are non-replicated, i.e., the
buggy hunks have different buggy statements or a buggy hunk has
multiple non-similar buggy statements. For Types 1 and 3, DEAR
fixes 9 less one-statement bugs than Hercules due to its incorrect
fixes. In total, DEAR fixes 12 bugs that Hercules misses: Chart-
7,16,20,24; Time-7; Closure-6,10,40; Lang-10; Math-41,50,91.

Compared to Tbar, DEAR fixes 15 more multi-hunk/multi-stmt
bugs. Tbar is not designed to fix multi-statements at once as DEAR.
Instead, it fixes one statement at a time, thus, does not work well
when those 15 bugs require dependent fixes to multiple statements.
The 3 bugs of Type 2 that Tbar can fix are the ones that the fixes to
individual statements are independent. The same reason is applied
to SimFix. Tbar fixes 11 more correct one-hunk/one-statement bugs.
In brief, we raise DEAR, a DL-based model, to the comparable

and complementary level with those pattern-based APR models.

6.4 RQ4. Sensitivity Analysis

Impact of Fixing-together Hunk Detection. As seen in Table 9,
6.4.1
without hunk detection, DEAR can auto-fix 35 bugs. With hunk
detection, DEAR can fix 14 more multi-hunk bugs (Types 3-5). It
fixes two less Type-1 bugs due to the incorrect hunk detection. In
brief, hunk detection is useful since the multi-hunk/multi-statement
bugs require dependent fixes to multiple hunks at once.

Impact of Multi-Statement Expansion. As seen in Table 9,
6.4.2
without expansion, DEAR fixes 43 bugs in Defects4J. With expan-
sion, it fixes 7 more multi-stmt bugs in Types 2,4,5 while it fixes two
less Type-3 bugs and one less Type-1 bug. The reason of fixing less
bugs in these two types is that the multi-statement expansion may
expand the buggy hunk incorrectly by regarding a single-statement
bug as a multi-statement bug. Even so, DEAR still can fix more
bugs, showing the usefulness of the multi-statement expansion.

To compare the impact of Hunk Detection and Multi-Statement
Expansion, let us note that the variant of DEAR without Hunk-
Detection missed all 14 multi-hunk bugs (Types 3,4,5). The variant
without Expansion missed all 7 multi-statement bugs (Types 2,4,5).
However, let us consider how challenging it is to fix them. Among
14 multi-hunk bugs fixed with Hunk-Detection, 11 bugs are of
Type-3 (multi-hunk/one-statement), in which some approaches
(e.g., Hercules) can handle by fixing one statement at a time. Only 3
bugs are of Types 4–5. In contrast, all 7 bugs fixed with Expansion
are multi-statement bugs (Types 2,4,5), which cannot be fixed by
existing DL-based APR approaches. Thus, Expansion contributes
to handling more challenging bugs than Hunk-Detection.

6.4.3
Impact of Tree-based LSTM model with Attention and Cycle
Training. (Attention-cycle) To measure the impact of Attention and
Cycle Training, we removed those two mechanisms from DEAR to
produce a baseline. Our results show that in Defects4J, DEAR fixes
7 more bugs on all bug types than the baseline (17.5% increase).
This result indicates the usefulness of the two mechanisms.

Impact of Training Data’s Size. Table 10 shows that the size
6.4.4
of training data has impact on DEAR’s performance. As seen in
Table 10, the more training data, the higher the DEAR’s accuracy.

This is expected as DEAR is a data-driven approach. But even with
less training data (70%/30%), DEAR achieves 11.7% for top-1 result,
which is still higher than DLFix (11.4% in top-1) and Sequencer (7.7%
in top-1); both are with more training data (90%/10% splitting).

6.5 RQ5. Time Complexity and Parameters

Training time of DEAR on CPatMiner was +22 hours and predicting
on CPatMiner took 2.4-3.1 seconds for each candidate patch. Train-
ing of DEAR on BigFix took 18-19 hours and predicting on BigFix
took 3.6-4.2 seconds for each candidate. Predicting on Defects4J
took only 2.1 seconds for a candidate due to a much smaller dataset.
Test execution time was +1 second per test case. Test validation
took 2–20 minutes for all the test cases for a bug fix.

The best baseline, CURE [14], fixes fewer bugs than DEAR (RQ1
and RQ2), and requires 7 and 7.3 times more training parameters
than DEAR on CPatMiner and BigFix, respectively. Specifically,
DEAR and CURE require 0.39M and 3.1M training parameters on
CPatMiner, and 0.42M and 3.5M parameters on BigFix. Thus, DEAR
is less complex than CURE, while achieving better results.

Threats to Validity. We tested on Java code. The key modules in
DEAR are language-independent, except for the third-party FL
and post-processing with program analysis. Pattern-based APR
tools require a dataset with test cases, thus, we compared them on
Defects4J only. We tried our best to re-implement the pattern-based
APR baselines and CURE for a fair comparison.

Illustrative Example. Figure 9 shows a correct fix from DEAR. It
correctly detects two buggy hunks; each with multiple statements.
DEAR leverages the variable names existing in the same method
(modifiableRootModel at line 8) in composing the fixed code at lines 11–
12. The DL-based baselines, Sequencer [6] and CoCoNuT [23], treat
code as sequences, and does not derive well the structural changes
for this fix. DLFix fixes one statement at a time, thus, does not work
(the fixes at line 2 and line 3 depend on each other). For pattern-
based APRs [13, 34], there is no fixing template for this bug.

Limitations. DEAR has the following limitations. First, as with ML
approaches, fixes with rare or out-of-vocabulary names are chal-
lenging. With more training data, DEAR has higher chance to en-
counter the ingredients to generate a new name. Second, we focus
only on the bugs that cause failing tests. Security, vulnerabilities,
and non-failing-test bugs are still its limitations. Third, we cannot
generate fixes with several new statements added or arbitrarily
large sizes of dependent fixed statements. Fourth, the expansion
algorithm produces incorrect hunks to be fixed, leading to fixing in-
correct statements. Finally, we currently focus on Java, however, the
basic representations used in DEAR, e.g., token, AST, dependency,
are universal to any program language. Only third-party FL and
post-processing with semantic checkers are language-dependent.

7 RELATED WORK

Deep Learning-based APR approaches. DeepRepair [42] learns
code similarities to select the repair ingredients from code frag-
ments similar to the buggy code. DeepFix [11] learns the syntax
rules to fix syntax errors. Ratchet [12], Tufano et al. [39], and Se-
quenceR [6] mainly use neural network machine translation (NMT)
with attention-based encoder-decoder and code abstractions to gen-
erate patches. CODIT [5] encodes code structures, learns code edits,
and adopt an NMT model to suggest fixes. Tufano et al. [38] learn
code changes using a sequence-to-sequence NMT with code abstrac-
tions and keyword replacing. DLFix [18] has a tree-based translation
model to learn the fixes. CoCoNuT [23] develops a context-aware
NMT model. CURE [14] proposes a code-aware NMT using GPT
model [31]. The existing DL-based APR models fix individual state-
ments at a time and are ineffective for multi-hunk/multi-stmt bugs.
Pattern-based APR approaches. Those approaches have mined
and learned fix patterns from prior fixes [15, 17, 19, 27], either auto-
matically or semi-automatically [17, 19, 20, 27]. Prophet [22] learns
code correctness models from a set of successful human patches.
Droix [37] learns common root-causes for crashes using a search-
based repair. Genesis [21] automatically infers patch generation
from users’ submitted patches. HDRepair [17] mines fix patterns
with graphs. ELIXIR [33] uses templates from PAR with local vari-
ables, fields, or constants, to build fixed expressions. CapGen [40],
SimFix [13], FixMiner [16] rely on frequent code changes extracted
from existing patches. Avatar [19] exploits fix patterns of static
analysis violations. Tbar [20] is a template-based APR tool with the
collected fix patterns. Angelix [25] catches program semantics to
fix methods. ARJA [44] generates lower-granularity patch repre-
sentation enabling efficient searching. We did not compare with
Angelix since we compared with CapGen that outperforms Angelix.
We could not reproduce ARJA, however, ARJA fixes only 18 bugs,
while DEAR fixes 42 bugs on the same four projects in Defects4J.

8 CONCLUSION

In this work, we make three key contributions: 1) a novel FL tech-
nique for multi-hunk, multi-statement fixes combining traditional
SBFL with deep learning and data-flow analysis; 2) a compositional
approach to generate multi-hunk, multi-statement fixes with divide-
and-conquer strategy; and 3) enhancements and orchestration of a
two-layer LSTM model with the attention layer and cycle training.
On Defects4J, DEAR outperforms the DL-based APR baselines from

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

Yi Li, Shaohua Wang, and Tien N. Nguyen

42%–683% in terms of the number of fixed bugs. On BigFix, it fixes
31–145 more bugs with the top-1 patches. On CPatMiner, it fixes
40–52 more multi-hunk/multi-stmt bugs than the baselines.
