ABSTRACT 

We  employ  the  mathematical  programming  approach  in  conjunction  with  the  graph  theory  to  study  the  structure  of 

correspondent banking networks.  Optimizing  the  network  requires  decisions  to  be made  to  onboard,  terminate or restrict 

the  bank  relationships  to  optimize  the  size  and  overall  risk  of  the  network.  This  study  provides  theoretical  foundation  to 

detect the components, the removal of which does not affect some key properties of the network such as connectivity and 

diameter. We find that the correspondent banking networks have a feature we call k-accessibility, which helps to drastically 

reduce  the  computational  burden  required  for  finding  the  abovementioned  components.  We  prove  a  number  of 

fundamental  theorems  related  to  k-accessible  directed  graphs,  which  should  be  also  applicable  beyond  the  particular 

problem of financial networks. The theoretical findings are verified through the data from a large international bank.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Correspondent banking (CB) network refers to a network of financial institutions providing cross-border payment 

services  for  customers  through  different  channels such  as SWIFT,  Fedwire,  etc.  Connections  in  the  CB  network 

represent existing relationships among banks and customers. Through the CB network, banks and their customers 

can  access  financial  services  in  different  jurisdictions  and  provide  cross-border  payment  services  to  their 

customers, supporting, among other things, international trade and financial inclusion. In addition, most payment 

solutions  that  do  not  involve  a  bank  account  at  the  customer  level  (e.g.  remittances) rely  on  CB  for  the  actual 

transfer of funds [1]. 

1.1. The Aspirations of the Work 

 
 
 
 
In today’s environment, financial institutions globally are at risk of being used by criminal organizations to launder 

money and by terrorist groups to facilitate the financing of their activities. Consequently, banks globally are facing 

increasing scrutiny  from  both  regulators  and  clients. Until  recently, banks  have maintained  a broad  network of 

correspondent relationships, but this situation is changing due to the global financial crisis of the last decade and 

economic slowdown. In particular, the profitability of the CB network is under pressure as banks need to comply 

with more regulation concerning risks such as money-laundering, terrorist financing, credit loss, reputation,  etc. 

For  example,  legislative  sanctions  acts  may  prohibit  the  banks  from  creating,  maintaining,  or  holding  a 

correspondent bank account with a foreign bank when the foreign bank holds or maintains a correspondent bank 

account with a bank or within a country considered illicit under the act. Increasing inter-bank competition due to 

low growth conditions in mature markets is another issue facing banks. 

A  report  published  by  the  Boston  Consulting  Group  in  2011  revealed  that  global  payments  volumes  are 

forecasted to grow at an  average compound rate of 9% per  year through to 2020  [2]. They estimated that the 

global payments market will be worth $782 trillion in noncash transaction value and $492 billion in transaction 

revenues by 2020. Accounting for 2.5% of the global cash volume in 2010, cross-border payments generated 10% 

of the revenue, and by 2020 are forecasted to account for 3.5% of the volume and 16% of revenue.  So in 2011, 

the Celent consulting firm reported that the cost of compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations is 

increasing at 7.9% per year [3]. This report resulted from an exclusive survey of AML compliance departments at 

more  than  75  financial  institutions  globally.  These  factors  force  the  banks  to  optimize  their  CB  networks  by 

potentially adjusting the number of relationships they maintain. When establishing new relationships, the banks 

must consider various profits, risks and cost criteria. [4].  

This study is the first to examine the structure of the CB network from a graph theory perspective. This should 

not  be  confused  with  other  banking  network  problems  in  economics  and  finance  such  as  Systematic  Risk 

Assessment  of  financial  networks,  a  well-understood  topic  in  the  literature  [5,  6].  Systematic  Risk  Assessment 

refers  to  analyzing  the  risk  of  interbank  liabilities  and  assets  in  the  form  of  unanticipated  changes  in 

macroeconomic  variables,  market-wide  illiquidity  or  chain  reaction  defaults  [7].  Other  example  to  quantify  the 

systematic risk is the networks of volatility spillovers, for example, for modeling the stock market relationships [8]. 

In a similar manner, Systemic Risk Assessment refers to assessment of the transmission of risk through a network 

of interbank obligations, in which the shock typically occurs only in one area of the network, and then spreads out 

to other areas through financial contagion (inability of a bank to make payments reduces the liquidity of its direct 

counterparties,  triggering  illiquidity  and  insolvency).  In  above-mentioned  literature,  the  network  science  has 

received  growing  attention  to  understand  the  behavior  and  dynamics  of  financial  markets,  and  describing  the 

 
 
interconnectedness  between  ﬁnancial  agents,  especially,  after  the  recent  global  ﬁnancial  crisis.  However,  the 

literature  around  CB  networks  is  limited  to  a  few  reports  and  patents  published  since  2012  (see  Section  1.2), 

revealing  that  the  CB  network  remains  little  discussed  and  understood  by  academics  and  institutional 

organizations.  Consequently,  there 

is 

little  theoretical  foundation  and  guidance  for  practitioners  and 

academicians  alike  [9].  One  possible  reason  for  this  is  rooted  in  the  sheer  complexity  of  Directed  Graphs 

(digraphs).  The  CB  networks  must  be  modeled  as  digraphs;  however,  there  has  been  much  less  success  in  the 

study of the spectra of directed graphs than of undirected graphs, perhaps because the associated non-symmetric 

adjacency  matrices  are  not  necessarily  diagonalizable.  Moreover,  real-world  networks  rarely  have  fine 

characteristics  of  directed  graphs  (such  as  k-connectedness,  k-regularity,  k-order,  eulerian-ness,  tournament, 

Pancyclicity,...) to be analyzed through the classical methods of graph theory. 

1.2. Literature Review  

We found only three peer-reviewed studies particularly focused on CB networks. Koko (2012) proposed a method 

for  determining  the  minimum  degree  of  separation  between  two  banks  [10].  As  a  result  of  regulation,  it  is 

important for a bank to investigate foreign institutions to determine the degree of separation the bank has from 

an  illicit  entity  via a foreign correspondent bank. From  a graph theory perspective, the degree of separation of 

any two banks may be computed  as the minimum  number  of edges (relationships) in  any path  linking the two 

banks. The proposed method considers the CB network with directional relationships so that the associated bank 

may have correspondent bank accounts with other banks (Nostro relationship) or vice versa (Vostro relationship). 

Using this method, one can study potential scenarios of violating the regulation by a bank in the CB network. This 

study used the concept of Bridge banks, which are a small set of banks that facilitate the connection between two 

distinct groups of banks. Hampapur et al. (2015) provided a design of an optimization engine that identified the 

best routes for a set of transactions to minimize cost, maximize revenue and reduce risk [11]. In a similar context, 

Soramaki et al. (2007) investigated the topology of interbank payment flows. They analyzed a stochastic network 

created  by  daily  transaction  data  from  the  Fedwire®  Funds  Service.  They  found  that  the  network  is  degree 

distribution scale-free and compact despite low connectivity. Moreover, they revealed that the properties of the 

network changed considerably in the immediate aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the North 

American blackout of August 14, 2003 [12].  

1.3 Contribution 

 
 
 
 
The above research works studied only a very specific aspect of the CB network with certain prior knowledge, e.g., 

the illicit entity or bridge set is known in advance. However, to optimize the CB network in a general sense, we 

have to  first learn  the key properties hidden  in  the network structure  from  a connectivity  point of view. These 

properties enable us to understand the network topology with the aim of reducing the computational burden of 

network  size  optimization,  mining  network  for  specific  components,  analyzing  what-if  scenarios  for  off- 

boarding/on-boarding  the  banks,  and  reducing  the  risk  of  not  meeting  regulation.  To  this  end,  we  consider  a 

deterministic CB network associated to a longer time window (e.g., year); instead of daily stochastic networks as 

considered in Soramaki et al. (2007). We study the network only from a topological (connectivity) point of view; 

regardless  of  the  amount  of  money  and  volume  of  transactions  between  pair  entities.  That  is,  we  suppose  an 

unweighted  digraph  in  which  all  connections  (edges)  and  entities  (nodes)  have  same  weight.  This  assumption 

enables us to study the structural properties of CB network where the importance of each entity only depends on 

its  neighbor  subnetwork.  These  properties  help  us, for  example,  to find  the  components  the  removal  of which 

destroys the network connectivity. This is the case when off-boarding of elicit entities is of interest. As another 

example, the extracted properties are also enabling us to optimize the network where the only available options 

are to keep, remove, or restrict the entities. For a better clarification, we split the notion of network optimization 

in  two:  1-  network  size  optimization:  removing  some  intermediary  banks  from  the  CB  network  without  direct 

impact to banks’ end customers (individuals, businesses or government entities) sending payments to each other. 

That is, after review, of each sender-receiver pair there is still a route through the network connecting them (re-

routing  some  transactions).  Potentially reducing banks in  the network  allows  for indirect customer  impact,  e.g. 

increased  fees  due  to  more  banks  involved  in  sending  a  particular  payment.  2-  Interconnectivity  optimization: 

allowing senders or receivers not to participate in certain activities in the network. This is equivalent to removing 

some connections (instead  of entities) which is interpreted  as restriction on relationship with some banks.  This 

would inevitably  lead  to the loss of CB revenue, which  must be balanced  with the associated  reduction  in risk. 

While the former scenario is the key motivation of this study, investigating the latter scenario is beyond the scope 

of this study and recommended as  future work. In this paper, we focus exclusively on  evaluating the impact of 

removing  the  components  (a  set  of  entities)  on  some  key  properties  of  the  network  such  as  connectivity  and 

diameter.  Although  the  mathematical  apparatus  we  develop  here  will  also  be  useful  to  address  the  more 

complicated  problem  of  Interconnectivity  optimization  or  weighted  network  in  which  not  every  relationship  or 

entity has the same risk/cost of removal.  

1.4 Methodology 

 
 
 
Nowadays, large-scale graph data is being generated in a variety of real-world applications, from social networks 

to co-authorship networks, and from financial networks to road traffic networks. Thus, graph mining methods are 

receiving  prominent  attention  to  study  high-order  network  structures  with  the  aim  of  prediction  or  anomaly 

detection.  In  this  study,  our  focus  is  on  digraphs  that  appear  in  many  application  scenarios  including,  but  not 

limited to, online social networks such as Twitter (e.g., referring to follower relations or to actual communication 

among  users)  and financial  networks.  In  fact,  recent  studies  reveal  that  most  real-world  networks  are  directed 

[13]. Our findings are also applicable to many directed graphs beyond financial networks.  

The  goal  of  the  majority  of  graph  mining  methods  is  to  find  structure-rich  subgraphs,  i.e.  components 

containing  most  of  the  information  about  the  entire  graph.  A  key  challenge  associated  with  finding  such 

structures  is  a  prohibitive  computational  cost.  The  problem  belongs  to  the  family  of  local  graph  clustering 

problems, for which efficiently identifying a low-conductance cut without exploring the entire graph is of interest. 

One well-known structure-rich component is the strongly connected component (SCC) which comprises all entities 

in the graph that can reach each other through a directed path. Empirical studies reveal that the majority of real-

world directed networks contain a Giant SCC [12, 14, 15]. For example, Soramaki et al (2007) showed that 0.3% of 

entities  in  the  Fedwire®  network  form  a  densely  connected  sub-graph  (clique)  to  which  the  remaining  nodes 

connect.  Thus,  finding  such  structure-rich  components  could  be  a  decent  starting  point  to  study  the  structural 

properties of the CB network.  

To this end, we model the CB network as a directed graph (digraph) using the historical data on SWIFT (Society 

for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) cross-border  payments. Our  network  analysis indicates 

the existence of a small set of banks in the CB network, each of which has access to, on average, 𝑘 other banks 

with a negligible variance. We also find that this set contains a unique SCC so that its size and density are tied up 

with the above-mentioned  variance. We refer to this prominent phenomenon  as “k-accessibility”.   Our analysis 

also  reveals  the  lack  of  correlation  between  the  accessibility  of  a  vertex  and  its  out-degree  in  the  CB  network, 

meaning  that  the  vertices  with  a  higher  out-degree  do  not  necessarily  have  access  to  a  larger  segment  of  the 

network.  Moreover,  the  CB  network  is  essentially  sparse  and  the  𝑘-accessibility  feature  is  not  due  to  a  dense 

network  with  a  large  number  of  connections.  The  key  explanation  for  this  feature  is  child-parent  relationships 

between the banks. That is, for the most part, the branches are transferring money through the headquarters or 

main  regional  offices.  However,  this  behaviour  is  not  always  the  case  as  a  bank’s  foreign  branches  are  also 

allowed  to  independently  do  business  with  other  institutions.  The  child-parent  relationships  also  result  in  too 

many  2-cycle  components  and  consequently  in  a  non-oriented  digraph  it  becomes  more  difficult  to  study  the 

structural  properties  of  the  network.  We  will  argue  that  the  network  optimization  problem  can  be  reduced  to 

 
 
finding a maximal subset of entities that belong to the SCC such that the removal of these entities still preserves 

some important properties of SCC such as strong connectivity and diameter.  

1.5 Assumptions and Structure of the Paper 

Our study is supported by the following assumptions inspired by common practice, business and regulatory rules: 

1.  To  create  the  CB  network,  we  used  a  subset  of SWIFT  payment  data,  as  viewed  by  Scotiabank,  a  large 

international bank headquartered in Toronto, Canada, with operations in nearly 50 countries. The bank 

can see all the transactions in which it is either a correspondent or intermediary bank. Each row of data 

represents a specific payment amount for a specific sender- receiver pair.  

2.  Due to a high variability of network traffic, the CB network undergoes assessment on a periodic basis. We 

considered  a  realistic  scenario  where  only  the  payments  over  the  last  year  are  examined.  The 

correspondent relationships and other factors affecting the network structure (e.g., banks merging) are 

assumed to remain unchanged.  

3.  The  revenue  obtained  from  the  network  is  a  direct  function  of  the  number  and  amount  of  payments. 

However, the temporal pattern of payments does not matter. Thus, we consider this to be a deterministic 

network. 

4.  The  transactions  between  the  banks  are  made  through  Vostro  accounts  in  the currency of  the  country 

where the money is on deposit. Thus, any existing relationship represents an existing Vostro account with 

a specific currency. It is assumed that the cost of closing a Vostro account is negligible. Likewise, the cost 

of opening a new Vostro account with a bank that already has relationships through other currencies will 

be  negligible  too.  This  is  because  there  is  already  a  relationship  agreement  between  two  institutions. 

Opening a new Vostro account is for finding alternative routes for transactions which may be affected by 

adjusting flows through the network. 

5.  The  network  analysis  is  performed  at  the  bank  branch  (child)  level.  Branches  of  a  parent  bank  are 

geographically  distributed  across  the  world.  Each  branch  may  work  with  other  banks  independently 

without  being  monitored  by  the  parent.  One  possible  reason  is  that  the  Vostro  accounts  do  not 

necessarily have centralized ownership. 

6.  The routing of transactions in the CB network follows a bifurcated pattern, meaning that the transaction 

does not follow a unique path between each sender-receiver pair. The routing of transactions is not fixed 

and may be changed depending on various factors. 

 
 
The paper is structured as follows. We begin in Section 2 with graphical representation of the CB network and a 

brief review of fundamental definitions of digraphs. In Section 3, the structural properties of the CB network will 

be studied through a number of proved theorems and inferences. In Section 4, we provide evidence to verify the 

ideas  and  interpret  the  theorems  proposed  in  Section  3  through  real-world  datasets.  Finally,  we  conclude  in 

Section 5.    

2. NETWORK DESIGN AND DEFINITIONS 

We represent the CB network as digraph 𝐺(𝑉, 𝐸) where the vertex set 𝑉 = Ψ⋃Λ is union of customer set Ψ and 

bank  set  Λ.  The  edge  set  𝐸 = 𝐸1⋃𝐸2  is  union  of  correspondent  relationships  (𝐸1: Ψ ↔ Λ)  and  interbank 

relationships (𝐸2: Λ → Λ). More specifically, two vertices are connected with a directed edge if there was either 

at least one payment between a customer (sender/receiver) and a correspondent bank or at least one transaction 

between two banks. Thus, we turn the historical transactions into the existing relationships through graph 𝐺. lth 

observation  represents  a  payment  for  pair  sender-receiver  (𝑠𝑙, 𝑟𝑙); 𝑠𝑙, 𝑟𝑙 ∈ Ψ  to  be  transferred  through  path 

Ρ𝑙 ⊂ Λ where Ρ𝑙 is an ordered series of banks.  

A digraph is acyclic if and only if it has no strongly connected subgraphs with more than one vertex. A subgraph 

is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. In our study, 𝐺 is assumed to 

be  acyclic  at  the  customer  level  but  not  at  the  bank  level.  However,  the  condensation  of  𝐺  (each  SCC 

is contracted to a single vertex) is acyclic, meaning that a customer can be either sender or receiver but not both 

at the same time. If this is the case, we add dummy vertices. Thus, 𝐺 is represented as a weakly connected source-

sink graph with one-way flow from source nodes (senders) to sink nodes (receivers). We say “weakly connected” 

since  even  though  the  graph  is  connected  there  is  not  always  a  path  from  each  sender  to  each  receiver.  The 

following definitions are provided  to facilitate our discussion  on  network analytics over  the next section. Some 

fundamental definitions are revisited from the graph theory.   

Adjacency Matrix: the adjacency matrix of 𝐺, 𝐴𝐺, is a binary and non-symmetric square matrix where 𝐴𝐺(𝑖, 𝑗) = 1 

means vertex i is adjacent to j or j is directly accessible from i. 

Vertex Degree: We define 𝐼𝑣 as In-degree of vertex 𝑣 (the number of inward edges to vertex  𝑣) and 𝑂𝑣 as Out-

degree of vertex 𝑣 (the number of outward edges from vertex 𝑣) given by             

𝐼𝑣 = 𝐼𝑣

Ψ + 𝐼𝑣

Λ = ∑

𝑐∈Ψ

𝐴𝐺(𝑐, 𝑣)

+ ∑

𝑏∈Λ

𝐴𝐺(𝑏, 𝑣)

,   

𝑂𝑣 = 𝑂𝑣

Ψ + 𝑂𝑣

Λ = ∑

𝑐∈Ψ

𝐴𝐺(𝑣, 𝑐)

+ ∑

𝑏∈Λ

𝐴𝐺(𝑣, 𝑏)
. 

 
 
Vertex Role: according to the above definitions, a sender is treated as a node with zero in-degree and a receiver as 

a  node  with  zero  out-degree.  Bank  𝑏 ∈ Λ  is  a  correspondent  sender  if  |𝐼𝑣

Ψ| > 0,  a  correspondent  receiver  if 

Ψ| > 0,  or  a  correspondent  bank  in  general  if  |𝐼𝑣
|𝑂𝑣
Λ × 𝑂𝑣
𝐼𝑣

Ψ| × |𝑂𝑣
Λ > 0. By these definitions, a bank may have a combination of the above roles. According to Assumption 4, 

Ψ| > 0.  Bank  𝑏 ∈ Λ  is  an  intermediary  bank  if 

the correspondent banks are not desired for evaluation since they are directly connected to the end customers. 

Therefore,  we  restrict  these    activities  to  all  non-correspondent  intermediary  banks  𝑣  where  |𝐼𝑣

Ψ| = |𝑂𝑣

Ψ| = 0. 

The bridge set is defined as a minimal set of banks, the removal of which divides the network into two disjointed 

sub-networks  of  senders  and  receivers.  Figure  1  displays  a  schematic  representation  of  the  CB  network  as  a 

source-sink network. As depicted in this figure1, the bridge set may not be unique.  

Figure 1. CB Network as a source-sink graph representation 

Vertex Eccentricity: is defined as the maximum distance (length of the shortest path) from a given vertex to any 

other vertex in the digraph.  

Digraph Diameter: is defined as the maximum distance between any pair of vertices or equivalently the maximal 

vertex eccentricity in the digraph.  

K-Clan Digraph: is an SCC with diameter k (any vertex is reachable through a shortest path of size at most k from 

any other  vertex). This definition  is analogous with Milgram's experiment on 6-degrees  of separation (or  small-

world) theory in social networks [16].  

Vertex Accessibility: Let Θ𝑣 be the set of all successor vertices accessible (directly or indirectly) through vertex 𝑣. 

This set can be obtained by the following forward breadth-first search (BFS) procedure as a traversal method. 

Θ𝑣 = ∅;  𝑆 = {𝑗 ∈ 𝛬 | (𝑣, 𝑗) ∈ 𝐸};  𝑒𝑐𝑐 = 0  
WHILE(𝑆 ≠ ∅) { 
Θ𝑣 = Θv⋃ 𝑆 

  Receivers       Senders Correspondent Banks Intermediary Banks Strongly connected component  Bridge sets  
 
 
 
𝑆 =   { 𝑗 ∈ 𝛬 | (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈ 𝐸;   𝑖 ∈ Θ𝑣;  𝑗

≠ Θ𝑣} 

𝑒𝑐𝑐 = 𝑒𝑐𝑐 + 1 

} 

We  define  the  size  of  set  Θ𝑣  as  Accessibility  of  vertex  𝑣  where  𝑎𝑐𝑐(𝑣) = |Θ𝑣|.  In  the  above  procedure,  𝑒𝑐𝑐 

calculates the eccentricity of vertex 𝑣; 𝑒𝑐𝑐(𝑣), where max𝑣 𝑒𝑐𝑐(𝑣) represents the digraph dimeter. If we make 

sure that the digraph is an SCC, then it is also 𝑘-Clan where  𝑘 = max𝑣 𝑒𝑐𝑐(𝑣). 

Strongly Connected Component (SCC): maximal subgraph (maximal subset of the vertices) in a directed graph such 

that  for  every  pair  of  vertices  𝑢, 𝑣 in the  subgraph,  there  is  a  directed  path  from 𝑢 to  𝑣 and  a  directed  path 

from 𝑣 to 𝑢.  

Strongly  Connected  Spanning  Subgraph  (SCSS):  smallest  subset  of  the  edges  in  a  given  digraph  preserving  the 

strong connectivity [17]. It is also referred as the Minimal Strongly Connected Component [18].  

Circumference: the length of longest cycle in the digraph [19]. 

𝒌-accessible Digraph: Digraph 𝐷 is 𝑘-accessible, if it contains core 𝐺;  𝐺 ⊆ 𝐷, in which each vertex has a path to, 

on average, 𝑘 other vertices in 𝐷 where the variance of vertex accessibility in core 𝐺 is negligible. In other word, a 

digraph is 𝑘-accessible if 𝑎𝑐𝑐(𝑣) ≈ 𝑘  ∀𝑣 ∈ 𝐺 so that 𝜇𝑎𝑐𝑐

𝐺 = 𝑘 and 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

𝐺 ≈ 0 where  𝜇𝑎𝑐𝑐

𝐺  and 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

𝐺  represents the 

mean  and  variance  of  vertex  accessibility  in  𝐺.  A  𝑘-accessible  digraph  represents  the  complete  digraph  if 

𝑘 = 𝑁 − 1 and 𝐺 = 𝐷. In cases in which 𝑘 is not unique, the largest 𝑘 will be considered. For example, if 𝐷 is a 

complete digraph, it is 𝑘-accessible for  𝑘 = 1,2, … , 𝑁 − 1. 

This feature is also analogous with the 𝑘-Plex definition – a maximal subgraph in which each vertex is connected 

to at least 𝑁 − 𝑘 other vertices, where 𝑁 is the order of induced subgraph. However, 𝑘-Plex considers the direct 

but not indirect accessibility. Figure 2 represents an example of 5-accessible CB network. In the next section, we 

investigate the characteristics of 𝑘-accessible digraphs through some fundamental theorems. We will show that 

each 𝑘-accessible has a SCC where 𝑆𝐶𝐶 ⊆ 𝐺 so that the size of SCC is correlated to 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐.

diameter exceeds 𝑘. 

Minimal 𝒌-accessible (MkA) Digraph: an 𝑘-accessible digraph with minimal number of edges. 

3. NETWORK ANALYTICS 

Sampling from the real data reveals that the 𝑘-accessibility is a dominant feature of CB networks. Thus, the aim of 

this section is first to discover the structural properties of 𝑘-accessible digraphs through a number of theorems 

and  then  show  how  these  theoretical  inferences  can  be  employed  for  the  network  optimization.  Since  finding 

different types of structure-rich components (e.g., SCC) in digraphs has been proved to be NP-Complete [20]; the 

couple of theorems are proposed to mitigate the complexity of finding such components in 𝑘-accessible digraphs.  

The  first  two  theorems  emphasize  that  any  𝑘-accessible  digraph  must  be  cyclic  having  at  least  one  SCC. 

Through  the  third  theorem,  we  prove  the  uniqueness  of  SCC  and  measure  its  magnitude  within  the  entire  CB 

network.  We  argue  that  the  search  space  for  network  size  optimization  should  be  limited  to  the  SCC  since  all 

entities  out  of  SCC  connect  the  customers  to  the  rest  of  the  network  and  therefore  should  not  be  touched. 

However, preserve connectivity through the entire network, the strong connectivity of SCC should be preserved 

during the optimization phase.   

The last three theorems help understand under which conditions the  SCC could be a k-Clan. It is a common 

practice  in  cross-border  payments  to  try  to  reduce  the  number  of  transitional  banks  between  a  sender  and  a 

receiver  in  order  to  keep  the  fees,  charges  and  transaction  turnaround  time  minimized.  This  is  equivalent  to 

setting  an  upper  bound on  the  diameter  of  the  SCC. According  to  the historical  payments,  this  upper  bound  is 

equal 6; meaning that having a 6-Clan SCC should be a constraint in network optimization problem. The classical 

method  for  establishing  whether  a  SCC  is  a  𝑘-Clan  is  measuring  the  distance  between  all  vertex  pairs  or 

equivalently finding max𝑣 𝑒𝑐𝑐(𝑣) in BFS procedure. Given a digraph 𝐷(𝑉, 𝐸), the complexity of BFS procedure is 
𝑂(|𝑉|2)  for dense graphs or 𝑂(|𝑉| + |𝐸|) for spars graphs. Even though we use the BFS procedure once during 

pre-processing task to calculate the vertex accessibility, it may not be computationally tractable to apply on large-

sized SCC for verifying the 𝑘-Clan feature. Instead, the last three theorems enable us to verify k-Clan feature only 

through the minimal information from the graph connectivity matrix (i.e., vertex out-degree) without the need for 

deep exploration of the whole network. 

While  the  first  two  theorems  are  focused  on  connectivity,  the  last  three  are  focused  on  diameter  of  SCC. 

Having  these,  we  will  discuss  that  the  best  optimization  practice  to  reduce  the  network size  in  an  𝑘-accessible 

 
 
network is to find a set of entities belong SCC, the removal of which still  preserves the strong connectivity and 

diameter of SCC. From now on, we ignore the end customers as individual entities and suppose that they are only 

the sources and sinks of flow in  the network. Thus,  we use “digraph” as a short term for  bank  subgraph  of CB 

network; a connected loopless digraph without multiple edges and with an order greater than three. Without loss 

of generality, the concepts of MkC and MkA digraphs will be used as basis to prove the theorems. It is obvious that 

any statement proved for minimal digraphs can be generalized for actual ones.    

3.1. Inferences on MkA Digraphs  

Theorem 1:  In an acyclic digraph of order 𝑁, the average of vertex accessibility does not exceed  

𝑁−1
.

Proof: Consider digraph 𝐷(𝑉, 𝐸) with |𝑉| = 𝑁 vertices labeled in ascending order from left to right; as shown in 

Figure 3. Since the digraph is acyclic, all edges are directed in ascending order of vertex labels.  

Figure 3. Line representation of acyclic digraph 

Given arbitrary vertices 𝑖. 𝑗 ∈ 𝑉, if vertex j is accessible from i, then no vertex v accessible from j is adjacent to i. 

As a generalization, all vertices accessible from j are not adjacent to any of the predecessors of j. Thus, 𝑎𝑐𝑐(𝑖) and 

𝑎𝑐𝑐(𝑗) cannot  be  equal  because  all  vertices  accessible  from  j  are  also  accessible  from  i.  Following  this,  the 

average  of  vertex  accessibility  will  be  maximized  if  each  vertex  𝑖  has  access  to  all  its  successors  𝑖 + 1, … , 𝑁. 

Meaning that, 𝑎𝑐𝑐(𝑖) = 𝑁 − 𝑖 and consequently the maximal 𝜇𝑎𝑐𝑐

Theorem 2:  Each MkA digraph 𝐷 with (𝑘 ≥

Proof: First we suppose 𝐷 is acyclic without SCC and try to construct an MkA digraph of order 𝑁 so that 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

𝐷  is 

We assume that 𝑘 ≤

 because, according to Corollary 1, the digraph is already cyclic for 𝑘 >

. Again, we 

assume a structure similar to Figure 3 in which all edges are directed in ascending order of vertex labels. Let 𝑥𝑒 be 

the  number  of  vertices  with  accessibility  equals  𝑒  where  0 ≤ 𝑒 ≤ 𝑁 − 1.  Since  the  digraph  is  assumed  to  be 

acyclic, there exists at least one sink (a vertex without outward edge) and thus 1 ≤ 𝑥0 ≤ 𝑁 − 1. Accordingly, 𝑥1

therefore  propose  the  following  linear  integer  programming  model  to  construct  an  acyclic  MkA  with  the  least

Objective function (1) calculates the variance of vertex accessibility where 𝑘 is given. Constraints (1.1) and (1.2) 

impose  upper  bound  on  decision  variables.  Equality  (1.3)  guarantees  the  order  of  the  digraph.  Inequality  (1.4) 

imposes  that  the  average  accessibility  of  vertices  must  be  enough  close  to  𝑘  so that  [

Finally, Inequality (1.5) guarantees the digraph connectivity where  𝑀+ is a large positive number.  Model (1) can 

be  optimally solved  using  the  classical  MIP  methods.  Through  benchmarking  on  various  values  of  𝑁  and  𝑘,  we 

realize that Model (1) has the following optimality structure:  

𝑥0 = 𝑥1 = ⋯ 𝑥𝑘 = 1, ∑

𝑋∗ = (𝑥0 = 1, … , 𝑥𝑘 = 1, 𝑥𝑘+1 = 𝑁 − 𝑘 − 1, 𝑥𝑘+2 = 0, … , 𝑥𝑁−1 = 0). 

Solution  𝑋∗  in  fact  represents  a  spanning  tree  as  depicted  in  Figure  4.1.  The  optimal  variance  of  vertex 

accessibility associated to this the optimal solution is obtained as

is a necessary condition to guarantee (1.4).  

Now we show that turning an acyclic digraph to a cyclic one will reduce 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

𝐷  below the optimal solution of Model 

(1) so that the average will remain slightly unchanged. To this end, we turn the optimal solution constructed by 

model  (1)  to  a  cyclic  digraph  by  creating  a  cycle  component.  So,  we  add  an  edge  from  the  sink  to  one  of  its 

immediate predecessor and thus change 𝑋∗ to   

(𝑥0 = 0, 𝑥1 = 2, … , 𝑥𝑘 = 1, 𝑥𝑘+1 = 𝑁 − 𝑘 − 1, 𝑥𝑘+2 = 0, … , 𝑥𝑁−1 = 0). 

As  a  result,  the  average  does  not  change  but  variance  will  be  reduced  by 

2𝑘−1
𝑁

.  By  induction  on  cycle  size,  the 

maximum reduction in variance will happen when the cycle has size of 𝑘 + 1; leading to an MkA digraph. That is, 

we add an edge from a sink to one of its predecessors with a vertex accessibility that equals 𝑘. Then, 𝑋∗ will be 

changed to  

(𝑥0 = 0, 𝑥1 = 0, … , 𝑥𝑘 = 𝑘 + 1, 𝑥𝑘+1 = 𝑁 − 𝑘 − 1, 𝑥𝑘+2 = 0, … , 𝑥𝑁−1 = 0). 

The above solution represents an MkA digraph as shown in Figure 4.2. Accordingly, the variance will be reduced to 

(1 −

𝑘+1
𝑁

) < 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

𝐷   and  the  average  accessibility  would  be  𝜇𝑎𝑐𝑐

∗ = (𝑘 + 1) (1 −

)  so  that  [𝜇𝑎𝑐𝑐

] = [𝜇𝑎𝑐𝑐

𝐷 ] = 𝑘. 

However, (1.4) requires that

It is obvious that (3) is much tighter than (4) since the upper bound of (4) can be waved because

𝑘 cannot be greater than 𝑁 − 1 by definition. As a conclusion, k-accessible digraphs with 𝑘 ≥

  must have a SCC 

of size 𝑘 + 1 to have a minimal variance of vertex accessibility.

Theorem 3: Each MkA digraph has a unique Giant SCC as core with order 𝑘 + 1 and without an outward edge. 

Proof: Suppose the digraph contains more than one SCC of various sizes. Note that the size of each SCC cannot 

exceed  𝑘+1;  otherwise,  it  is  in  contradiction  with  the  k-accessible  feature.  Let 𝐺′  be  the  condensation  digraph 

produced by contracting the SCCs into individual vertices. Now we argue that each SCC is a sink (without outward 
edge) in 𝐺′ of order k+1 to keep 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐 minimized.  

Consider  a  candidate  SCC  containing  s  vertices  with  one  outward  edge  to  vertex  i  as  sink.  Then,  the  partial 

variance of vertex accessibility related to the candidate SCC is given by 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

SCC =  𝑄 + 𝑠 × (𝑘 − 𝑠)2 + 𝑘2 where 𝑄 

is  the  portion  related  to  the  inward  edges  to  the  SCC.  Moreover,  since  𝑖  is  sink,  we  have  𝑎𝑐𝑐(𝑖) = 0,  and 

𝑎𝑐𝑐(𝑣) = 𝑠 ∀𝑣 ∈ SCC. Now we swap the SCC and vertex i so that SCC turns to the sink with an inward edge from 

SCC′
vertex  i.  Thus,  the  revised  partial  variance  is  given  by  𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

=  𝑄 + 𝑠 × (𝑘 − 𝑠 + 1)2 + (𝑘 − 𝑠)2  where 

𝑎𝑐𝑐(𝑖) = 𝑠, and 𝑎𝑐𝑐(𝑣) = 𝑠 − 1 ∀𝑠 ∈ SCC . Consequently, we have  

SCC′
𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

= 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

SCC + 𝑔(𝑘, 𝑠), 

where  𝑔(𝑘, 𝑠) = 1 + 2𝑘 − 2𝑠(1 + 𝑘) + 𝑠2.  It  is  straightforward  to  show  that  parabola  𝑔(𝑘, 𝑠)  has  an  optimal 

SCC′
minimum  value  that  equals  −𝑘2  at  𝑠 = 𝑘 + 1,  resulting  in  𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐
obtained when SCC is a sink of order 𝑘 + 1 in 𝐺′.  

< 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

SCC.  Thus,  the  lowest  variance  will  be 

Finally, we show that the SCC is unique. Suppose not and thus   there are some vertices in 𝐺′ having access to 

more than one SCC as sink in 𝐺′; otherwise, 𝐺′ is disjointed and contradicts with the original assumption. Thus, 

the  abovementioned  vertices  have  an  accessibility  equal  or  greater  than  2(𝑘 + 1).  For  instance,  consider  a 

digraph with two disjoint SCCs each of which has 𝑘 + 1 vertices and both have one common inward vertex. Thus, 

the order of digraph is 𝑁 = 2(𝑘 + 1) + 1. Thus,  

𝜇𝑎𝑐𝑐 =

2(𝑘+1)+(𝑁−1)𝑘
𝑁

=

2(𝑘+1)
2(𝑘+1)+1

(𝑘 + 1). 

Accordingly, 𝜇𝑎𝑐𝑐 → 𝑘 + 1 when 𝑘 → ∞; contradiction with 𝐺′ being 𝑘-accessible. Thus, the uniqueness of SCC is 
a necessary and sufficient condition for 𝐺′ to be 𝑘-accessible. Some examples of k-accessible, as optimal solutions 

to Model (1), are shown in Figure 5. The number displayed close to each vertex represents 𝑎𝑐𝑐(𝑣). The red circles 

represent the vertices with only output flow which are interpreted as correspondent sender (or receiver) in the 

CB network. As is evident in this figure, all digraphs have only one GSCC of size 𝑘+1.

Corollary 3: The accessibility variance in MkA digraph, i.e., (1 −

𝑘+1
𝑁

), is an upper bound on accessibility variance 

in all 𝑘-accessible digraphs.  

Corollary 2 can be also re-verified through theorem 2. Suppose Corollary 2 is not true and thus GSCC of a 𝑘-

accessible  digraph  contains  more  than  𝑘 + 1  vertices.  Then,  it  is  straightforward  to  show  that  [𝜇𝑎𝑐𝑐] > 𝑘,  a 

contradiction with the original assumption. 

Corollaries  2  and  3  provide  a  link  between  the  above  theorems  and  the  real  world.  In  practice,  all  sender 

correspondents  do  not  necessarily  have  a  tail  in  SCC,  meaning  that  SCC  is  not  the  bridge  set  of  the  network. 

Moreover, all receiver correspondents are not necessarily belonging to SCC, meaning that SCC is not necessarily a 

sink without an outward edge. Thus, the variance of accessibility is not minimized in the real world. In fact, the 

above theorems and associated inferences shows that 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

SCC is a unique metric representing the magnitude of SCC 

and thereby the macro-structure of CB network, as depicted in Figure 6. Suppose the BFS procedure reveals that 

the given CB network of order 𝑁 is 𝑘-accessible. Thus, when 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

SCC approaches zero, all components of set Ψ in 

Figure 6 will merge to a Giant SCC (GSCC) of order 𝑘 + 1; representing a sink without an outward edge to other 

banks. In contrary, when 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

SCC increases, the SCC turns into a bridge set of decreasing order 𝑘′ < 𝑘 + 1. In this 

scenario, 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

G < 1 −

 where 𝐺 is the core of network containing 𝑆𝐶𝐶 (see Figure 6). In this case, if the number 

of  corresponding  senders  equals  𝑘 + 1 − 𝑘′  (there  is  a  path  from  all  corresponding  senders  to  SCC),  SCC  is 

certainly a bridge set.

Figure 6. Macro structure of CB network as a function in terms of 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐

The  best  strategy  for  network  size  optimization  is  to  look  for  the  entities  in  SCC,  the  removal  of  which  still 

preserves the strong connectivity of SCC. This strategy has two advantages: 1- reduction in computational efforts 

by limiting the exploration space to the SCC, 2- least negative effects on customers (only the direct customers of 

the  removed  entities  will  be  affected).  However,  the  diameter  of  SCC  will  be  a  constraint  on  optimization. 

Meaning that, by removing some elements of SCC, its diameter should not be increased; in other words, the CB 

network must remain a 6-Clan digraph.     

3.2. Inferences on MpC Digraphs  

Through the following propositions and theorems, we study the situations under which the SCC of a 𝑘-accessible 

digraph  could be  𝑝-Clan,  given  𝑝  where 𝑝 > 1.  Recalling  the  definition  of  MpC,  an  infinite  diameter  means  the 

component is no longer an SCC. First, we find the minimal requirements a digraph must have to be 𝑝-Clan. To this 

end,  an  integer  programming  (IP)  model  is  proposed  to  construct  MpC  digraph  and  then  the  properties  and 

topology of the digraph are studied through the optimality conditions. Then, we employ a theorem by  Knyazev 

(1987) to find a tight upper bound on diameter of the digraph. This helps us to estimate the diameter without the 

need for deep exploration of the network structure by time-consuming traversal methods. 

 Theorem 5: The number of edges in minimal p-Clan digraph of order 𝑁 is 

𝑚∗(𝑁, 𝑝) = {

 . 

(5) 

Proof: Let 𝐷(𝑉, 𝐸) be an MpC digraph with |𝑉| = 𝑁 > 3 vertices and 𝑚 edges. It is obvious that for 𝑝 = 1, the 

minimum  number  of  edges  to  have  a  p-Clan  digraph  equals  the  number  of  edges  in  the  associated  complete 

digraph, i.e., 𝑚∗ = 𝑁(𝑁 − 1). We propose the following Lemma to facilitate the calculation of 𝑚∗ when 𝑝 > 1.

Lemma 1: The problem  of minimizing  edges is equivalent to  the problem of maximizing  the distances (shortest 

path) of length p in a p-Clan digraph.  

Proof: To proof Lemma 1, we propose an integer programming (IP) model to construct the MpC digraph, given p. 

Let 𝑥𝑖𝑗

𝑙 = 1; if the distance between pair vertices 𝑖 and 𝑗 equals 𝑙 where 1 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝑁 − 1; otherwise, 𝑥𝑖𝑗

𝑙 = 0. Thus, 

1

(6.4) 

The  objective  of  (6.1)  is  to  minimize  the  number  of  edges.  Constraint  (6.2)  imposes  that  𝑥𝑖𝑗

𝑙 = 1  means  𝑗  is 

reachable  by  𝑖  through  𝑙 − 1  intermediary  vertices.  The  strict  inequality  of  (6.2)  indicates  that  several  paths  of 

same  length  may  exist  between  the  pair  of  vertices  (𝑖, 𝑗).  Also,  this  constraint  avoids  sub-tours  and  thereby 

guarantees the digraph to be connected. Constraint (6.3) avoids multiple distance assignments between pairs of 

vertices and, at the same time, does not allow the digraph diameter to exceed 𝑝. Finally, constraint (6.4) enforces 

the integrality of decision variables and avoids loops in the digraph.  

Considering  inequality  constraints  (6.2),  we  use  the  Karush-Kuhn-Tucker  (KKT)  conditions  to  study  the 

optimality  conditions. To  this end, we consider  the LP  relaxation  of model (6) where  0 ≤ 𝑥𝑖𝑗

𝑙 ≤ 1 and, thereby, 

the  penalty  term 𝑥𝑖𝑗

𝑙 (1 − 𝑥𝑖𝑗

𝑙 ) = 0  ∀𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑙  is added  to ensure  the integrality  of the decision  variables.  Thus,  the 

objective  function  and  constraints  are  continuously  differentiable in  the  relaxed  model.  To  examine  the  KKT 

conditions, we construct the Lagrangian function as follow:

Now we can prove Theorem 5 by induction on 𝑝 where, according to Lemma 1, the objective is to maximize the 

distances of length 𝑝. To do so, we consider the following scenarios for 𝑝 to execute the induction.  

Scenario 1: Suppose 𝑝 = 2,  then  we show that  the star topology  with a single hub  and  bi-directed edges has a 

minimum number of edges and maximum number of distances of length 2. First, we rewrite (6.2) for 𝑝 = 2,

The optimality conditions enforce the strict equality for constraints (9.2) so that the only feasible solution is

topology with vertex ℎ as hub.  

Scenario 2: Suppose 𝑝 > 2, let any arbitrary node to be hub and divided the rest 𝑁 − 1 nodes into 𝐿 cycles (folds) 

each of which contains 𝐾 nodes so that mod(𝑁 − 1, 𝐾) = 0. If each cycle is contracted to a single node and then 

connected  to  the  hub  through  a  bi-directed  edge,  the  obtained  structure  would  be  a  star  topology  same  as 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Scenario 1. Therefore, this structure is also optimal for 𝑝 = 2𝐾 with 𝐿 × (𝐾 + 1) = (1 +

) (𝑁 − 1) edges where 

mod(2(𝑁 − 1), 𝑝) = 0.  In  this  case,  the  hub  has  a  degree  equal  to  𝑁 − 𝑝 + 1  and  the  rest  of  nodes  have  a 

degree equal to one. 

Suppose  mod(2(𝑁 − 1), 𝑝) ≠ 0.  Then,  similar  to  the  former  case,  we  try  to  construct  a  semi-star  topology 

where the hub has a degree equal 𝑁 − 𝑝 + 1 and the rest of the nodes have a degree equal one. To do so, a large 

cycle  of  size  𝑝  is  created  and  the  rest  𝑁 − 𝑝  vertices  are  attached  to  a  single  vertex  of  the  cycle  through  bi-

directed edges. This structure has 𝑝 + 2(𝑁 − 𝑝) =  2𝑁 − 𝑝 edges (each bi-directed edge represents a 2-cycle).  

Theorem  5  can  be  also  verified  through  the  experimental  results.  To  this  end,  we  solve  Model  (6)  for 

𝑁 = 3,4, … ,10 and 𝑝 = 1,2, … , 𝑁 − 1 using Branch-and-Bound method. The objective values are summarized in 

Table  1  and  the solutions for 𝑁 = 5,6  are schematically shown in Figure 7. Since Model (6) is nonlinear due to 

quadratic constraint (6.2), the global optimum cannot be guaranteed. However, the solutions reported in Table 1 

are either exactly the same as what we claimed in Theorem 5 or extremely close. Moreover, the resulted 2-Clan 

digraphs have a single-hub star topology as claimed in Lemma 1 and schematically shown in Figure 7.

Corollary 4: If a bank branch belongs to SCC, then its parent bank also does.  

Proof: It is straightforward since there is a 2-cycle relationship between the parent bank and all of its branches.  

Knyazev’s Theorem [21]: Let 𝐷(𝑉, 𝐸) be a strongly connected Eulerian digraph (link symmetry - 𝑂𝑖 = 𝐼𝑖  ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝑉) 
𝑁

. If  𝐷  contains no 2-Cycle then, the diameter  of 𝐷  is at 

with  𝑁  vertices and minimum  out-degree  𝛿, 2 ≤ 𝛿 ≤

𝑁. Moreover, if 𝐷  is 𝛿-regular  digraph (𝑂𝑖 = 𝐼𝑖 = 𝛿  ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝑉), then  the diameter  of 𝐷  is greater  than 

4
2𝛿+1

𝑁 − 4 +

1
2𝛿+1

.  

Dankelmann (2005) showed that Knyazev’s upper bound can be improved to 

4
2𝛿+1

𝑁 − 4 [22]. Knyazev’s theorem 

requires 𝐷  to be  regular (without 2-cycle),  Eulerian  and 2 ≤ 𝛿 ≤

𝑁
2

.  Thus, to implement  Knyazev’s Theorem  for 

our study, we propose the following propositions to meet these requirements.  

Proposition 1: Any strongly connected digraph 𝐷(𝑉, 𝐸) can be reduced to a regular strongly connected digraph by 

contracting each 2-cycle component into a single vertex. 

Proposition 2: Any strongly connected digraph 𝐷(𝑉, 𝐸) is extended to a strongly connected Eulerian digraph using 

the following procedure:  

Let 𝑑𝑖 = max{𝐼𝑖, 𝑂𝑖} be the degree of vertex 𝑖 ∈ 𝑉 in the extended Eulerian digraph. To ensure the equality of in-

degree and out-degree for each vertex 𝑖 ∈ 𝑉, we insert the set of nominal vertices Ω where |Ω| = max𝑖∈𝑉{|𝐼𝑖 −

𝑂𝑖|}.  Then,  𝑑𝑖−𝑂𝑖  outward  edges  are  added  from  vertex  𝑖  to  some  vertices  in  Ω;  if  𝑑𝑖 = 𝐼𝑖.  Likewise,  𝑑𝑖 − 𝐼𝑖 

inward edges are added from some vertices in Ω to vertex 𝑖; if 𝑑𝑖 = 𝑂𝑖. Thus, the total inward edges from 𝑉 to Ω 

is  ∑ (𝑑𝑖−𝑂𝑖)

𝑖∈𝑉

  and  the  total  outward  edges  from  Ω  to  𝑉  is  ∑ (𝑑𝑖−𝐼𝑖)

𝑖∈𝑉

.  It  is  well-understood  that  ∑ 𝐼𝑖

𝑖∈𝑉 =

∑ 𝑂𝑖

𝑖∈𝑉 = 𝑚  and  therefore  Ω  has  the  same  in-degree  and  out-degree  equals  ∑ 𝑑𝑖

𝑖∈𝑉 − 𝑚.  Since  𝐷  is  strongly 

connected, it is straightforward that ∑ 𝑑𝑖

𝑖∈𝑉 − 𝑚 = 2|Ω|; then, the equality of in-degree and out-degree for each 

vertex in Ω is also guaranteed. 

Proposition 3:  The minimum  out-degree  in  Eulerian  digraph  generated  by  Proposition  2  is  maximized  using  the 

following procedure: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Let 𝜍𝑖 ⊂ Ω be the set of all vertices in Ω which are not adjacent with 𝑖 ∈ 𝑉; after applying Proposition 2.

Set  𝛿 = min𝑖{𝑑𝑖}  and 𝑗 = arg min𝑖{𝑑𝑖}. 

Find a cooperative vertex 𝑞 ∈ 𝑉 where |𝜍𝑗 ∩ 𝜍𝑞| ≥ 2 and 𝑑𝑖 ≤

. If such a cooperative vertex cannot be found then STOP; 

Select vertices 𝑣, 𝑤 ∈ 𝜍𝑗 ∩ 𝜍𝑞 and add edges 𝑖 → 𝑣, 𝑤 → 𝑖, 𝑗 → 𝑤, 𝑣 → 𝑗 to ensure all vertices 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑣, 𝑤 have the 
same incremental in- and out-degree. 

Set 𝑑𝑗 ← 𝑑𝑗 + 1, 𝑑𝑞 ← 𝑑𝑞 + 1, 𝜍𝑗 ← 𝜍𝑗/{𝑣, 𝑤}, 𝜍𝑞 ← 𝜍𝑞/{𝑣, 𝑤}.

LOOP 

The  above  procedure  has  a  linear  complexity.  The  artificial  increase  in  the  number  of  vertices  in  Proposition  2 

negatively  affects  the  Knyazev’s  upper  bound. However, Proposition  3  enables  us  to  compensate  this  effect  by 

increasing  the  minimum  out-degree  of  the  digraph.  The  above  propositions  enable  us  to  set  an  explicit  upper 

bound on diameter of the CB network; only requiring the out-degree of the entities.  

3.3. Summary of Inferences  

The findings of Section 3 can be summarized as follows; providing some insights for designing and optimizing the 

CB networks.  

o  Possible scenarios for CB network optimization: 

 

If the termination of relationship is allowed (as is supposed in this study)  

o  and  the  suspicious  entities  are  known  in  advance,  we  encounter  a  what-if  analysis;  how  the 

network’s characteristics are affected if some specific entities are dropped off.    

o 

If the objective is to improve the overall risk profile relative to the returns of the network, then 

certain benefits may be realized by minimizing the SCC size – finding a maximal subset of entities 

belonging to SCC, the removal of which still preserves the strong connectivity without an increase 

in  diameter  (see Figure 8 for examples). Solving  this problem is beyond  the scope of this study 

and recommended as future work. As a guideline, by associating a cost coefficient per entity, the 

problem  can  be  formulated  as  a  class  of  Asymmetric  Salesman  Problem  with  some  side 

constraints to preserve the SCC’s characteristics. 

 

If the relationship should not be terminated but can be restricted, the problem is equivalent to finding an 

SCSS  (Strongly  Connected  Spanning  Subgraph)  inside  the  SCC  without  increasing  in  diameter.  This  is 

 
 
 
equivalent to finding MpC digraph associated with SCC if 𝑝 is given. Theorem 5 provides an explicit lower 

bound for this problem and Model (6) can be modified to solve this problem. Khuller et. al (1995) showed 

that when the circumference is three, the classical SCSS problem is as hard as Bipartite Matching. When it 

is five, the problem is NP-hard. When it is seventeen, the problem is AX-SNP-hard [17]. In Appendix B, we 

provide some insights to estimate the circumference of 𝑝-clan digraphs; however, we do not discuss the 

complexity.

(directly  or  indirectly)  the  senders  to  the  SCC  (sender  correspondents)  and  therefore  cannot  be 

eliminated from the network.

Likewise,  any  entity  𝑣  where  𝑎𝑐𝑐(𝑣) < 𝑘  connects  the  rest  of  the  network  to  receivers  (receiver

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

This section is dedicated to verification of the theorems in Section 3 using samples of Scotiabank SWIFT payments 

records, a dataset of 8.7 million cross-border payments over the 2018 fiscal year. The SWIFT messages allow us to 

track the flow of individual payments from sender to receiver passing through the different transactional banks. 

The original CB network extracted from this dataset consists of about 12,000 branches belonging to about 2,000 

various financial institutions, serving nearly 200,000 customers across the world. 

Network Sampling 

For the purpose of benchmarking, we take a few smaller samples in the form of subnetworks from the original CB 

network.  Each  sample  represents  a  pool  of  payments  that  went  through  all  branches  of  a  candidate  bank 

distributed  across  the  world.  This  strategy  results  in  high  diversity  of  assortativity  and  thereby  in  less  bias  in 

sampling. The assortativity measures the similarity of connections in the graph with respect to the node degree. 

This  sampling  strategy  is  not  biased  toward  high-degree  nodes,  which  is  an  issue  with  many  graph  traversal 

techniques  (e.g.,  BFS,  DFS,  Forest  Fire,  Snowball  Sampling,  RDS)  [23].  Thus,  the  subnetworks  created  using  the 

above strategy are plausible standalone scale-free networks because the degree distribution follows a power law, 

as depicted in Figure 9. 

The average order of bank subgraph in sampled subnetworks is 3000 entities. The average number of edges is 

1.5 times that of the entities, representing a sort of sparse subnetwork. Since the theorems proved in Section 3 

are based on minimal digraphs, the sparse  (rather than dense) samples are preferred for verification purposes. 

The  ratio  of  the  number  of  intermediary  banks  to  the  number  of  correspondent  banks  is  less  than  5%.  The 

assortativity of digraph in all samples is negative; representing absolute dissimilarity between degrees of adjacent 

vertices.  

Sample  1:    The  first  sample  is  a  subnetwork  with  2212  vertices  and  3878  edges.  The  histograms  of 

inward/outward  degree  of  vertices  are  displayed  in  Figure  9.  While  the  distribution  of  inward  and  outward 

 
 
 
 
 
degrees is highly right-skewed (power law), their range is also relatively high. This is due to our sampling policy in 

which  all  transactions  went  through  a  few  major  branches  of  a  candidate  bank.  The  vertices  with  zero  inward 

degree represent sender correspondents and those with zero outward degree represent receiver correspondents.  

Inward Degree (range between 0 to 67) 

Outward Degree (ranged between 0 to 1246) 

Figure 9. Inward/outward degrees of vertices – Sample 1 

The histogram of vertex accessibility calculated using the BFS procedure is shown in Figure 10. The accumulated 

mass  over  extreme  values  indicates  a  𝑘-accessible  subnetwork  with  𝑘 = 1840.  That  is,  there  is  a  core  of  100 

entities having access to, on average,  1840 other entities where 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐 = 4.75. Since 𝜎𝑎𝑐𝑐 > 1 −

𝑘+1
𝑁

= 0.1681, 

according to Corollaries 2 and 3, the SCC is neither a bridge set nor a sink  in the network. 26 out of 100 entities 

construct  SCC  with  accessibility  equal  to  1838  and  50  out  of  100  entities  have  a  tail  in  SCC  with  an  equal 

accessibility  of  1839.  The  existence  and  uniqueness  of  the  SCC  is  verified  using  components(.)  function  in  the 

igraph package in R. This function is used  to detect all possible strongly connected components in the network 

using Tarjan’s algorithm based on deep-first search (DFS) method with a linear complexity. There are 23 entities 

that  have  accessibility  greater  than  𝑘  ranging  from  1840  to  1874.  Moreover,  there  are  106  entities  with 

accessibility ranging between 1 and 26, meaning that none of them have a tail in SCC. The rest of the entities have 

zero accessibility, representing receiver correspondents.  

 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10. Vertex accessibility– Sample 1 

The assortativity of the subnetwork is -0.214; calculated using the  igraph package in R. As pointed out earlier, a 

negative assortativity represents very good diversity among the degree of vertices. The reason for this promising 

value  is  our  sampling  strategy  where  we  choose  the  candidate  banks  whose  branches  are  well-distributed 

geographically. The entities in Sample 1 are geographically distributed in 86 countries and 5 continents.  

The above analysis reveal  that  the search space  for network optimization  could be  reduced  from 3043  entities 

and 3878 edges (subnetwork shown in Figure 12) to only 27 potential entities and 64 edges (SCC shown in Figure 

13). As discussed at the end of the last section, we are looking for the entities belonging to SCC, the removal of 

which preserves the strong connectivity and SCC’s diameter. If such entities exist, the parent bank and thereby all 

associated branches can be removed from the network (Corollary 4) without negative effects on the customers.

Figure 12. Subnetwork- Sample 1 

Figure 13. GSCC – Sample 1 

Figure 14. GSCC –Sample 2 

Using diameter() function in the igraph package, we find the diameter of the entire subnetwork is 7, while  the 

diameter of the CSS is 6, indicating a 6-Clan digraph.  

To examine Knyazev’s upper bound, first we regularize SCC using Proposition 1. This results in a reduced subgraph 

of order 23 due to the elimination of four 2-cycles. Then, we turn the subgraph into an Eulerian subgraph using 

Propositions  2  and  3.  To  this  end,  we  add  𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖{|𝐼𝑖 − 𝑂𝑖|} = 10  nominal  entities  and  necessary  edges  to  the 

subgraph to ensure the equality of in-degree and out-degree for all entities. The outcome is an Eulerian subgraph 

of  order  23+10  =  33  and  minimum  out-degree  𝛿 = 6.  Thus,  Knyazev’s  upper  bound  is 

4
2×6+1

(33) − 4 = 6.15 

which is nearly same as the diameter calculated by the igraph package.  

Moreover, according to Theorem 5, the SCC must have at least 𝑚∗(23,6) = 60 edges to be eligible for being 

6-Clan, while currently it has 64 edges. Thus, the optimal entities for reduction are those the removal of which 

does not reduce the number of edges by more than 64-60 = 4. 

Sample 2: The second sample is a subnetwork of order 3,000 with 3316 edges and assortativity coefficeint -0.447. 

This subnetwork is a 2850-accessible network with a core of order 138 entities have access to, on average, 2850 

other  entities  where  σacc = 1.390.  31  out  of  138  entities  construct  the  GSCC  shown  in  Figure  14.  The  inward 

degree, outward degree and accessibility of vertices follow similar patterns shown in Figures 9 and 10. The GSCC 

has diameter equals 5; however, Knyazev’s upper bound is 

4
2×6+1

(29 + 5) − 4 = 6.2. Theorem 5 imposes at least 

m∗(31, 5) = 57  edges  for  GSCC  to  be  5-Clan  and  currently  it  has  75  edges.  Thus,  the  optimal  entities  for 

reduction are those the removal of which does not reduce the number of edges by more than 18. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Structural Analysis of Original CB Network  

The original CB network has 33,901 nodes with 192,855 edges and assortativity coefficeint -0.318. The network is 

26,487-accessible  with  a  core  of  order  23,767  and  a  GSCC  of  order  16,406  where  σacc = 7.829  which  is 

significantly greater than the threshold 1 −

k+1
N

= 0.218. Then, we can say GSCC play the role of bridge set in the 

network due to a large σacc compared to the threshold. Since 𝑘 ≥

𝑁
2

, any entity with accessibility greater than k 

has outward edge(s) to GSCC. That is, 23,767 - 16,406 = 7,361 entities represent the corresponding senders and 

the rest (33,901 – 23,767 = 10,134) represent the corresponding receivers. As depicted in Figure 15a, there is a 

significant positive correlation between inward and outward degree of entities in GSCC whereas each one follows 

a power law distribution, as shown in Figure 9. Moreover, the indgree-to-outdegree ratio (Figure 15b) indicates a 

sort  of  link  symmetry  (indegree    outdegree)  in  GSCC.  However,  the  non-GSCC  entities  (more  than  half  of  the 

network  - Figure 15b) are corresponding senders and receivers without  spesific in/out-degree  pattern.  The link 

Symmetry increases the overall connectivity of the network and reduces its diameter. As an  insight, the GSCC in 

CB network behave like a sotial network (scale-free) rather than web (hub-and-spoke structure).

The  diameter  of  the  entire  network  is  7  and  the  diameter  of  the  GCSS  is  6.  The  GSCC  must  have  at  least 

m∗(16406, 6) = 21,705 edges to be eligible for being 6-Clan; while, it currently has 166,791 edges. So, there is 

enough room for the optimization; without affecting the GSCC’s diameter. 

 
 
 
 
 
5. CONCLUSIONS 

This research work is the first to provide a theory-based view of CB network and provides theoretical foundation 

to  explain  the  network  optimization  scenarios.  The  provided  theorems  and  related  inferences  enable  us  to 

understand  the  structural  properties  of  CB  networks  and  reduce  the  search  space  for  network  optimization; 

avoiding the need for deep exploration of the network. We discovered a remarkable feature of CB networks, k-

accessibility, where the network contains a maximal set of entities, i.e., core, that have access to, on average, k 

other banks with a negligible variance. The key reason for this behaviour is the child-parent relationship between 

branches and their head offices. This feature has been verified through the network sampling.  We showed that 

any k-accessible network has a Giant Strongly Connected  Component  of  order  k+1  and  thus  our search for  the 

potential  evaluation  and  remediation  should  be  restricted  to  this  component  instead  of  the  entire  network. 

Additionally, we argued that the diameter of the network must be a concern through the optimization phase to 

ensure a reasonable length for alternative transaction routes after removing some entities. 

We  employed  the  mathematical  programming  approach  to  prove  several  theorems  through  studying  the 

optimality conditions of the proposed models. We showed that constructing the minimal k-accessible and p-Clan 

digraphs can be formulated as MIP and quadratic IP models respectively.      

We  investigated  the  structural  properties  of  CB  networks  using  a  binary  (unweighted)  adjacency  matrix. 

However,  in  future  work,  a  real-valued  adjacency  matrix  may  represent  the  amount  or  volume  of  historical 

transactions among entities, indicating the connection’s strengths. Having this, we can measure the importance 

of each entity  in  the network through assigning relative centrality/prestige  score  (e.g., betweenness, closeness, 

eigenvector,…) to each entity. The entities with the lowest score can be considered for evaluation or remediation. 

Alternatively,  one  may  employ  an  unsupervised  clustering  approach  to  classify  the  entities  in  terms  of  a  set  of 

features  obtained  from  the information  existing  in  an  adjacency matrix,  properties extracted  from  the  network 

structure, and various centrality scores. Moreover, more investigation on the structural properties of CB networks 

such as studying redundant edges, cycles and Pancyclicity may help us to detect some suspicious structures that 

may represent anomalous activities. The inferences discussed in this study are also applicable in directed-graph 

applications beyond the particular problem of financial networks.  

Appendix A: Sufficient Optimality Conditions 

The  system  of  equations  (7)  contains  the  first-order necessary  conditions for  a  solution  to  be optimal.  These 

conditions  will  also  represent  the  sufficient  optimality  conditions,  if  (−𝑧)  is  a  concave  function,  inequality 

constraints (6.2) are convex functions and equality constraints (6.3) are affine functions. Even though 𝑧 is a linear 

 
 
 
function  (and  thereby  concave),  (6.2)  is  not  a  convex  function  and  therefore  we  have  to  verify  the  Slater 

condition.  In  convex  optimization  problems  with  differentiable  objective  and  constraints,  the  Slater  condition 

imposes that if there is a feasible solution so that Constraints (6.2) hold with strict inequality (feasibility), then KKT 

conditions  provide  both  necessary  and  sufficient  conditions  for  optimality.  Slater’s  condition  guarantees  the 

strong duality and implies that the optimal duality gap is zero and the dual optimum is attained. As pointed out 

earlier, constraints (6.2) hold strict inequality when the path between the pair of vertices is not unique. This is a 

case  in  complete  digraphs  (1-Clan)  where  there  are  multiple  paths  of  same  length  between  pair  vertices.  The 

complete digraph is always a feasible solution to Model (6) for any 𝑝. Hence, Slater’s condition is always held by 

Model (6). As a result, the system of equations (7) represents both necessary and sufficient optimality conditions. 

Appendix B: Estimation on circumference of MpC digraphs 

Theorem: The circumference of minimal 𝑝-Clan digraph (𝑝 > 2) is at most 𝑝 + 1. 

Proof: Scenario 2 of Theorem 5 reveals that the  circumference is 2 for 𝑝 = 2 (recall that each bi-directed edge 

represents  a  2-cycle).  Suppose  𝑝 > 2,  then  according  to  the  proposition  2.1  in  Khuller  et  al.,  (1995):  “If  the 
circumference of an strongly connected digraph of order 𝑁 is 𝑙, then any SCSS has at least (𝑁 − 1) 𝑙
𝑙−1

 edges” [24]. 

Suppose  circumference  of  MpC  digraph  is  𝑝 + 1;  thus,  any  SCSS  extracted  from  the  digraph  has  at  least 

𝑚SCSS = (1 +

1
𝑝

)(𝑁 − 1)  edges  which  is  an  extremely  tight  lower  bound  on  𝑚∗(𝑁, 𝑝)  from  Theorem  5. 

Therefore,  the  circumference  should  be  at  most  𝑝 + 1;  otherwise  𝑚SCSS > 𝑚∗(𝑁, 𝑝)  which  is  a  contradiction 

with the definition of SCSS.  

Corollary: The circumference of any 𝑝-Clan digraph (𝑝 > 2) is at most 𝑝 + 1. 

Woodall’s Theorem: “Given undirected graph 𝐺 with 𝑁 vertices, 𝑚 edges (𝑚 ≥ 𝑁) and circumference 𝑐, then 

𝑚 ≤

1

2

(𝑁 − 1)𝑐 −

1

2

𝑟(𝑐 − 𝑟 − 1), 

where 𝑟 = 𝑟(𝑁 − 1, 𝑐 − 1). Given positive integers 𝑎 and 𝑏, 𝑟(𝑎, 𝑏) = 𝑎 − 𝑏⌊𝑎

𝑏⁄ ⌋, the remainder on division 𝑎 by 

𝑏” [19]. 

Proposition:  Woodall’s  Theorem  can  be  improved  for  digraphs  as  𝑚 ≤ (𝑁 − 1)𝑐 − 𝑟(𝑐 − 𝑟 − 1).  Thus,  a  lower 

bound on circumference is obtained as  

𝑐 ≥

𝑚−𝑟(𝑟+1)
. 
𝑁−(𝑟+1)

 
 
 
Suppose  the  digraph  is  𝑝-Clan.  Since  𝑟  is  a  positive  integer  number  and  according  to  Theorem  5  we  have 

𝑚 ≥ 𝑚∗(𝑁, 𝑝) > 𝑁, the left hand side of above term will be maximized whenever 𝑟 = 0. Thus, the lower bound 

on the circumference of any digraph can be improved to 𝑐 ≥

𝑚
𝑁−1

. As a conclusion, the circumference of any 𝑝-

Clan digraph is bounded as
