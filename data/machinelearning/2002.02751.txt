Abstract. This paper proposes a model based on gene expression programming 
for predicting discharge coefficient of triangular labyrinth weirs. The parameters 
influencing discharge coefficient prediction were first examined and presented as 
crest height ratio to the head over the crest of the weir (p/y), crest length of water 
to channel width (L/W), crest length of water to the head over the crest of the 
weir  (L/y),  Froude  number  (F=V/√(gy))  and  vertex  angle  (𝜃)  dimensionless 
parameters.  Different  models  were  then  presented using  sensitivity  analysis  in 
order to examine each of the dimensionless parameters presented in this study. 
In addition, an equation was presented through the use of nonlinear regression 
(NLR)  for  the  purpose  of  comparison  with  GEP.  The  results  of  the  studies 
conducted  by  using  different  statistical  indexes  indicated  that  GEP  is  more 
capable than NLR. This is to the extent that GEP predicts discharge coefficient 
with  an  average  relative  error  of  approximately  2.5%  in  such  manner  that  the 
predicted values have less than 5% relative error in the worst model.

Introduction 

Conventional weirs are structures used to control, regulate and measure water level and 
flow volume in irrigation and drainage networks and water and wastewater treatment 
plants.  A  conventional  weir  is  usually  installed  along  the  flow  and  perpendicular  to 
channel axis. Conventional weirs include rectangular, V-notch, labyrinth and complex 
weirs.  Many  theoretical  and  experimental  studies  investigated  passing  flow  from 
conventional weirs. Taylor [1] presented an experimental study on hydraulic labyrinth 
weirs.  Hay  and  Taylor  [2]  described  how  the  head  on  the  labyrinth  weir  effects  the 
discharge ratio. Tullis et al. [3] investigated trapezoid labyrinth weirs and indicated that 
their discharge capacity was a function of total head, effective length of weir crest and 

coefficient  of  discharge  of  labyrinth  weir.  Wormleaton  and  Soufiani  [4]  studied 
hydraulic  features  and  aeration  of  triangle  labyrinth  weirs.  They  found  that  aeration 
efficiency of triangle labyrinth weirs is more than linear weirs with equal length. Also, 
Wormleaton  and  Tsang  [5]  studied  aeration  of  rectangular  weirs  experimentally. 
Emiroglu and Baylar [6] investigated the effects of weir included angle and water sill 
slope of weir on aeration in triangle labyrinth weirs. Tullis et al. [7] studied hydraulic 
behavior and flow head on submerged labyrinth weirs. They concluded that the flow 
over  submerged  labyrinth  weirs  did  not  depend  on  labyrinth  weir  sidewall  angles. 
Bagheri and Heidarpour [8] used free vortex theory to estimate discharge coefficient of 
sharp-crested rectangular weirs as a function of flow features, channel geometry and 
conventional weir. Kumar et al. [9] experimentally investigated discharging capacity 
of triangle labyrinth weirs. They suggested a relation to calculate the flow over triangle 
labyrinth weirs through analyzing experimental data. 

Considering the complexity of engineering problems and the  growing number of 
engineering studies, new methods called soft computing, were significantly used during 
recent decade that were more efficient and more accurate in solving complicated and 
difficult  engineering  issues  and,  facilitating  studies  [10-13].  Soft  computing  and 
artificial  intelligence  were  used  by  different  researchers  to  estimate  and  predict 
different hydraulic and hydrologic problems especially discharge coefficient [14-17]. 
Emiroglu et al. [18] used Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) techniques 
to predict discharge capacity of the triangular labyrinth side weir. They introduced an 
equation for discharge coefficient in this type of side weirs. The diversion flow passing 
over sharp-crested rectangular side weirs were predicted using Feed Forward Neural 
Networks (FFNN) and Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBNN) by [19]. Bilhan et al. 
[19] introduced an equation for discharge  coefficient as a  function of geometric and 
hydraulic features for sharp-crested rectangular side weirs. Emiroglu et al. [20] used 
artificial neural networks to introduce a relation which calculated discharge coefficient 
of triangle labyrinth weirs located in rectangular in under critical flow conditions.  

Gene  Expression  Programming  (GEP)  is  one  method  used  in  water  hydraulic 
engineering  during  recent  years.  Unlike  artificial  neural  system  and  neuro  fuzzy 
systems  which  include  a  black  box,  the  suggested  method showed  high  accuracy  in 
estimating the given parameter and relation [21-25]. 

Using Gene Expression Programming (GEP), the present study aims to introduce 
an  equation  to  predict  discharge  coefficient.  Therefore,  the  parameters  influencing 
discharge coefficient are first determined and then an equation is presented using GEP. 
Following  that,  the  effect  of  each  of  the  dimensionless  parameters  is  examined  on 
predicting discharge coefficient through using sensitivity analysis. Also, the results of 
the GEP model are compared with that of nonlinear regression (NLR).

Data collection 

The present study used Kumar et al. [9] experimental data to estimate the coefficient of 
discharge. A horizontal rectangular channel with 12 m length, 0.28 m width and 0.41 

 
m depth was used in their tests. The used triangle weir was located 11 m away from the 
channel entrance. Water was provided for the channel through an inlet pipe from an 
overhead  tank  supplied  with an  overflow  arrangement  to  keep  a  constant  head.  The 
water height over weir crest was measured by point gages having ±0.1 mm accuracy. 
Ventilation holes were installed on both sides of the weir’s downstream for the purpose 
of  aeration  of  the  nappe.  Wave  suppressors  and  Grid  walls  were  structured  at  the 
upstream of the channel to break and dissipate the surface disturbances and to enlarge 
the size of eddies, respectively. They conducted their experiments on 30, 60, 90, 120, 
150, and 180 degree weirs. They also used varied discharges for each of the mentioned 
angles. They eventually carried out 123 different experiments for different discharges 
and angles. Schematic of Kumar et al. [9] experimental model is illustrated in Fig. 1. 
Table 1 shows the parameters used in the present study.

Overview of Gene Expression Programming 

GEP  is  a  developed  genetic  programming  [26].  It  is  a  search  technique  relying  on 
computer  programs  such  as  decision  tree,  logical  expressions,  polynomial  construct, 
and mathematics statements. GEP computer programs are coded as line chromosomes 
and the final presentation is in the form of expression trees (ETs) [27] . ETs are complex 
computer  programs  which  are  developed  to  solve  a  given  problem  and  are  selected 
according to their fitness to the problem [25].  Considering that in GP, genotype and 
phenotype  are  mixed  in  a  simple  replicator  system,  GEP  of  a  genotype/phonotype 
system  is  developed  where  genotype  is  completely  separated  from  phenotype. 
Therefore,  developed  GEP  genotype/phonotype  system  is  100  to  60000  times  more 
effective than GP system [28, 29] . 

In GEP process, the first chromosome of each independent parameter is randomly 
generated in the population. Then, they are developed and all independent parameters 
are evaluated based on fitness function and are used as a part to produce new generation 
with  different  characteristics.  People  of  the  new  generation  develop  through 
confrontation  with  the  selection  environment,  expression  of  the  genomes  and 
reproduction  with  modification.  The  process  continues  until  getting  the  predefined 
generation or getting the answer [28, 29] . 

Ferreira [30] described the fitness of an individual function (i) for the fitness model 

(j) as: 𝐼𝑓   𝐸(𝑖𝑗)    ≤ 𝑝, 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑓(𝑖𝑗) = 1,

, 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒   𝑓(𝑖𝑗) = 0 

(1) 

where p and E(ij) are the precision and error, respectively. Then the absolute error 

can be obtained from: 
𝐸(𝑖𝑗) = |𝑝(𝑖𝑗) − 𝑇𝑗| 

Where the (fi) for an individual function calculated as follows:  

𝑓𝑖 = ∑(𝑅 − |𝑝(𝑖𝑗) − 𝑇𝑗) 

(2) 

(3) 

where  Tj,  R  and  p(ij)  are  the  target  values,  selection  range,  and  predicted  values, 
respectively. Accordingly, the terminal set (T) and function set (F)  are calculated to 
select the chromosomes. Fig. 2 presents the GEP flowchart.

Derivation discharge coefficient based on GEP 

Reviewing the recent studies conducted on estimating discharge coefficient in weirs, 
crest height (p), head over the crest of the weir (y), crest length of the weir (L), channel 
width (W), and Froude number (F=V/√(gy)) parameters can be named [19,18,20, 31]. 
The dimensionless parameters in estimating discharge coefficient can be presented as 
equation 4 through using dimensional analysis.

The  manner  of  function  estimation  through  using  the  GEP  method  to  predict

used randomly as suggested by Kumar et al. [9]. Furthermore, 80% of data can be used 
for testing. To produce an initial population of, according to Ferreira’s [28] the range 
of 30-100 is suggested In the next step a fitness function is calculated using MSE as 
follows:

Result and discussion 

The accuracy of the model presented through the use of GEP (equation 7) is examined 
in this section with using different statistical indexes. In addition, sensitivity analysis is 
also  conducted  in  order  to  study  the  effect  of  each  of  the  dimensionless  parameter 
presented  in  predicting  discharge  coefficient.  Following  that,  the  results  from  this 
model will also be compared with the results of the nonlinear regression analysis (NLR) 
to examine the accuracy of the model presented by using GEP. 

 
 
 
In  order  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  estimated  model  at  each  step  of  model 
development, the results of analysis of GEP and NLR is based on the criteria of the 
coefficient of determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute 
Percentage Error (MAPE), Adjusted Coefficient of Efficiency (CE) and Scatter Index 
(SI) as defined in the following forms:

where 𝐶𝑑𝐸𝑋𝑃𝑖

 and 𝐶𝑑 𝐺𝐸𝑃𝑖

 denote the  actual  and  modeled discharge coefficient values 

and  𝐶𝑑 𝐸𝑋𝑃  and  𝐶𝑑𝐺𝐸𝑃  represent  the  mean  actual  and  modeled  discharge  coefficient 
values, respectively. 

The closer the value of index R2 to 1, the more  it shows the compatibility of the 
estimated  value  with  the  real  value.  Results  which  are  obtained  from  coefficient  of 
determination (R2) have been simulated in relation with linear dependence between real 
and  corresponding  values  (for  the  present  case,  the  actual  and  simulated  discharge 
coefficient values) and they are sensitive towards deviated points; so in evaluating the 
results, we cannot solely rely on this index. Thus, other statistical indexes like mean 
absolute  percentage  error  (MAPE)  -  which  shows  the  difference  between  real  and 
estimated models in form of percentage of actual values- and root mean square error 
(RMSE)  -  which  considers  the  weight  of  larger  errors  by  powering  the  difference 
between actual and estimated values - are needed in order to estimate the function of 
the models. Both MAPE and RMSE indexes can include zero value (best mode) and 
infinity (worst value). Also, dimensionless RMSE criterion which is stated in SI form 
can  be  applied  in  estimating  different  models  without  considering  dimension  of 
parameters. Besides, as a complementary criterion, the "adjusted coefficient efficiency 
(CE)" could be utilized for evaluating the precision of models. This index reports the 
difference between the proportion of remainders variance (numerator term) and the data 
variance (denominator term) from 1. If this index equals 1, the presented model has 
done data estimation in the best way. Simultaneous use of these indexes could provide 
sufficient information for precision of the applied models [32]. 

As mentioned earlier, the data utilized in this study is divided into two groups of 
“train” and “test” in such way that 20% of the data is selected through random selection 
without replacement for the purpose of testing, and the discharge coefficient parameter 
was presented as equation (7) using the remaining 80% data. Fig. 4 shows the results 
obtained  from  training  the  presented  GEP  model  in  test  and  train  states.  The  x  axis 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
indicates the actual values and y axis presents the values predicted by GEP. It could be 
seen in the figure that almost the majority of the predicted amounts predict the discharge 
coefficient fairly accurately in both states of test and train. The GEP model presented 
in the train predicts the train-state values with R2=0.95 and an average relative error 
percentage approximate to 2% (MAPE). Most of the values presented in this state have 
a less- than- 5% relative error. The other statistical indexes used in the train state of this 
research are RMSE=0.017, CE=0.78 and SI=0.02 indexes MAPE and RMSE have very 
low amounts - as can be seen almost zero - which indicates the high accuracy of the 
presented model. The predicted values have an R2=0.93 and a MAPE=2.53% in the test 
state which are almost similar to that of the train state. Also SI, CE, RMSE indexes are 
equal to 0.021, 0.67 and 0.029 respectively for the test state of this model. Therefore, 
considering Fig. 3 and the presented statistical indexes for train and test states of the 
presented GEP model, it could be stated that GEP predicts the discharge coefficient of 
triangular labyrinth weirs very well. 

Fig. 4. Comparing estimated discharge coefficient with experimental result (Test and Train) 

Through  the  use  of  sensitivity  analysis  in  this  section,  the  effect  of  each  of  the 
presented  parameters  is  examined  on  predicting  discharge  coefficient  of  triangular 
labyrinth  weirs.  Therefore,  different  models  are  presented  as  Table  4.  To  estimate 
discharge in each of these models, the data is divided into two 80% and 20% groups, 
like  they  were  in  equation  (7),  for  the  purpose  of  training  and  testing  the  model, 
respectively. Tables 5 and 6 present the results of different statistical indexes, presented 
in the study, for the two “train” and “test” states, respectively. They demonstrate that 

 
 
 
the results of all the statistical indexes are better for model 1 when compared to the rest 
of the models for both train and test states. Also, Fig. 5 indicates that the maximum 
relative error of model 1is lesser than all other models. Therefore, it could be stated that 
the simultaneous use of dimensionless parameters of crest height ratio to the head over 
the crest of the weir (p/y), crest length of water to channel width (L/W), crest length of 
water  to  the  head  over  the  crest  of  the  weir  (L/y),  Froude  number  (F=V/√(gy))  and 
vertex  angle  (𝜃)  is  fixed  in  predicting  discharge  coefficient  of  rectangular  labyrinth 
weirs. To examine the effect of each of the dimensionless parameters, the results of the 
statistical indexes of each model must be compared with regard to model 1 which is the 
best model and is presented as equation (7). It could be observed that model 2, which 
considers all the parameters of model 1 except for the vertex angle (θ), presents better 
results  in  comparison  with  models  3,  4,  5,  and  6.  Therefore,  it  could  be  stated  that 
among the five presented dimensionless parameters, vertex angle (θ) parameter has the 
least value of effect on predicting discharge coefficient of triangular labyrinth weirs. 
Models 3, 4, 5 and 6 which disregard Froude number (F=V/√(gy)), crest length of water 
to the head over the crest of weir (L/Y), crest length of water to channel width (L/w), 
and  crest  height  ratio  to  the  head  over  the  crest  (p/y)  dimensionless  parameters 
respectively, do not present better results in comparison with models 1 and 2. Therefore, 
not  using  these  parameters  prevents  predicting  discharge  coefficient  relatively 
accurately  in  such  manner  that  in  some  cases  their  maximum  relative  error  is 
approximately 20% regarding Fig. 5. Therefore, it is essential to use these parameters 
in predicting discharge coefficient.

Fig.  6  shows  the  results  of  discharge  coefficient prediction  for  the  two  presented 
models using GEP and NLR. The x axis of this figure shows the experimental values 
(Target)  and  the  y  axis  shows  the  values  predicted  through  using  GEP  and  NLR 
methods. The data used in this figure had no role in estimating equation (7) and (13) 
and as mentioned in the previous sections they were selected using random selection 
without replacement for the purpose of testing the model. The figure indicates that the 
equation presented by using GEP (equation 7) is fairly accurate in predicting discharge 
coefficient  in  a  way  that  it  predicts  all  the  predicted  discharge  coefficients  with  a 
relative error less than 5%. This figure also shows that the equation presented by using 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NLR mostly presents the discharge coefficient to be less than the actual value which 
leads  to  underestimating  the  prediction  of  the  passing  discharge  and  so  causes 
underestimating. It could also be observed that the predicted values have a relative error 
greater than 5% in this state as opposed to GEP equation.

Table 7 shows the results of the statistical indexes presented in this study in order to 
verify the accuracy of the equations presented by using GEP and NLR in predicting 
discharge coefficient for both states of train and test. Careful consideration of the table 
indicates that R2 is more and less than 0.9 in both states of train and test of GEP and 
NLR respectively. It could also be seen that the average relative error is approximately 
2.5% for GEP in test state and it is almost 4.5% for NLR. It is also observed that the 
results of RMSE and SI indexes for GEP are less than NLR and considering the fact 
that approaching these two indexes to zero indicates the higher accuracy of the model, 
it could be stated that the GEP model presented in this study is relatively less accurate 
with regard to the results obtained from NLR. The values predicted using equations (7), 
(GEP), and (13), (NLR), are presented in Table 8 for different hydraulic conditions.

where Cd is coefficient of discharge, w/y the ratio of crest height to head over the 
crest of the weir, L/W ratio of crest length of water to channel width, L/y the ratio of 
crest length of water to the head over the crest of the weir, F Froude number, L crest 
length of water, y head over the crest of the weir, g acceleration due to gravity and 𝜃

Conclusions 

There are many ways to control flood such as using weirs which are either located 
aside or along the channel. To predict the coefficient of discharge of a weir along the 
channel, the present study made use of the ratio of crest height to head over the crest of 
the weir (p/y), crest length of water to channel width (L/W), crest length of water to the 
head over the crest of the weir (L/y), Froude number (F=V/√(gy)) and vortex angle (θ) 
and  an  equation  has  been  presented  as  equation  7  using  GEP.  The  accuracy  of  the 
presented  model  was  examined  through  taking  different  statistical  indexes  into 
consideration  and  the results  indicated  that  equation  7  predicts  discharge  coefficient 
with an approximate relative error of 2.5% for hydraulic conditions which had no role 
in  training  the  model.  Also,  the  amounts  of  all  the  Cd  predicted  through  using  this 
method  had  a  relative  error  less  than  5%.  Following  that,  different  models  were 
presented  in  order  to  examine  the  effect  of  each  of  the  dimensionless  parameters 
presented  in  this  study.  The  results  demonstrate  that vortex  angle  (θ)  parameter  had 
lesser  effect  in  predicting  Cd  in  comparison  with  the  other  models.  Also,  the 
simultaneous use of crest height ratio to the head over the crest of the weir (p/y), crest 
length of water to channel width (L/W), crest length of water to head over the crest of 
weir  (L/W),  Froude  number  (F=V/√(gy)),  and  vertex  angle  (θ)  dimensionless 
parameters  is  necessary  in  predicting  the  discharge  coefficient.  Then,  in  order  to 
examine  the  accuracy  of  the  models  presented  by  using  GEP,  in  comparison  with 
nonlinear regression analysis (NLR), an equation was presented through using NLR as 
equation 13 and the results indicated the higher accuracy of GEP in comparison with 
NLR.
