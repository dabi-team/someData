Abstract:  The  problem  of  class  imbalance  is  extensive  for  focusing  on 
numerous  applications  in  the  real  world.  In  such  a  situation,  nearly  all  of 
the examples are labeled as one class called majority class, while far fewer 
examples are labeled as the other class usually, the more important class is 
called minority. Over the last few years, several types of research have been 
carried out on the issue of class imbalance, including data  sampling, cost-
sensitive analysis, Genetic Programming based models, bagging, boosting, 
etc. Nevertheless, in this survey paper, we enlisted the 24 related studies in 
the  years  2003,  2008,  2010,  2012  and  2014  to  2019,  focusing  on  the 
architecture  of  single,  hybrid  and  ensemble  method  design  to  understand 
the  current  status  of  improving  classification  output  in  machine  learning 
techniques  to  fix  problems  with  class  imbalances.  This  survey  paper  also 
includes a statistical analysis of the classification algorithms under various 
methods and several other experimental conditions, as well as datasets used 
in different research papers.

Introduction 

The data is the most valuable asset and one of the best 
possible  sources  for  any  research  and  development.  Data 
can  be  viewed  as  one  of  the  significant  components  of 
educational and business strategy decisions. Therefore, the 
data for research and development for any major decision 
should be balanced and accurate. Balanced data is one of 
the  major  concerns  nowadays.  Data  Imbalance  problems 
impede  the  performance  of  the  classification  algorithm 
(Singh  and  Purohit,  2015).  However,  the  efficiency  of 
predictive models is significantly impacted when the data 
set  in  the  real  world  is  highly  imbalanced  (Amin  et  al., 
2016).  So,  the  data  are  used  for  strategic  decisions  and 
research  should  be  balanced.  When  class  distribution  in 
the  dataset  is  not  uniform,  the  data  are  called  imbalance 
(Haykin,  1999).  In  such  cases,  there  are  only  a  limited 
number of instances represented in the least one known as 
minority class and the remainder of the dataset consisting 
of other classes  is  known as  majority class. Recent  work 
has  shown  that  output  an  unequal  distribution  of  class 
examples  in  the  learning  process  can  skew  efficiency. 

This means the class provides minimal specificity on the 
minority  class  while  it  offers  great  accuracy  in  the 
majority  class.  Class  disparity  in  the  datasets  can 
drastically  skew  the  performance  of  classifiers  in  a 
majority-minority  classification  problem,  introducing  a 
prediction  bias  for  the  majority  class  (Leevy  et  al., 
2018).  Though  high 
the  output 
significantly, some of the small imbalances metrics were 
beneficial (Koziarski et al., 2018). 

imbalance  affects 

Researchers  divided  the  data  imbalance  problem 
into  two  major  categories:  Multiclass  data  imbalance 
(Bhowan  et al., 2011). In a multiclass dataset, there are 
more  than  two  classes  and  just  two  classes  in  a  binary 
dataset.  There  are  plenty  of  attempts  to  fix  the  issue  of 
binary class imbalance, but the different types of problems 
relevant to the problem of multiclass imbalance are not yet 
solved (Rout et al., 2018). Learning from imbalanced data 
is studied extensively in standard classification and also in 
multilevel  classification  in  recent  times  (Charte  et  al., 
2019).  There  are  two  major  approaches  (external  and 
internal) used to build methods to solve the problem of data 
imbalances (Eggermont et al., 2004). Bagging and boosting

Over the years, many scholars and researchers have 
done some successful  work on the improvement of the 
imbalance  dataset.  This  study  analyzed  all  of  the 
relevant  research  in  the  data  collection  of  imbalances 
over  the  last  separate  ten  years. In  total 24  articles  are 
enlisted  in  this  survey  paper  from  2003,  2008,  2010,

Research Paper Overview 

A  number  of  researches  are  going  on  in  the  field  of 
data  mining  and  machine  learning  such  as  keyword 
extraction  (Showrov  and  Sobhan,  2019),  summarization 
(Abulaish  et  al.,  2018;  Showrov  et  al.,  2019a),  breast 
cancer detection (Showrov et al., 2019b) and so on. The 
most  challenging  problem  nowadays  in  this  field  is  a 
class imbalance. Several scholars have suggested various 
types of approaches for dealing with problems with class 
imbalances.  Methods  of  data  level,  methods  of  leveling 
algorithms and methods of the ensemble are categorized 
methods.  Hybrid  methods  are  another  group  type  for 
dealing with the problem of class imbalances. 

Data Level Methods 

This  approach  is  geared  towards  matching  the  class 
distributions.  The  class  distribution  are  being  balanced 
using  the  sampling  methods  by  resizing  the  training 
datasets. The sampling  methods can be categorized into 
techniques for under-sampling and over-sampling. 

Over-Sampling Technique 

Oversampling  is  the  method  of  either  randomly 
increasing the  number of instances  in the  minority class 
to increase the disparity ratio such that the corresponding 
classification  algorithms  can  be  employed  for  the 
classification of the data. The benefit of this technique is 

that  any  necessary  information  is  not  missed  from  the 
dataset  and  the  primary  dataset  can  be  preserved  even 
though new data is appended to it for balancing the data 
(Kaur and Gosain, 2018). 

SMOTE 

Synthetic  Minority  Over-sampling  Technique 
(SMOTE)  is  a  process  to  increase  the  data  into  the 
minority class by generating new synthetic  data using 
the  existing  data  (Junsomboon  and  Phienthrakul, 
2017). It is capable of producing patterns that follow a 
distribution similar to the true on  (Elreedy and Atiya, 
2019).  However,  other  methods,  such  as  fuzzy  or 
locally  linear  embedding  (Verbiest  et  al.,  2012), 
continue to improve SMOTE. 

Cluster-Based Over-Sampling (CBO) 

This approach contains clustering the training data of 
each class separately that is achieved using the k-means 
method. Thereafter, random over-sampling is carried out 
on all clusters (Popel et al., 2018). 

ADASYN 

Adaptive  synthetic  sampling  method 

improves 
learning  on  the  distributions  of  data  in  two  ways:  (1) 
Reduction the biasness  which is introduced  by the class 
imbalance and (2) adaptively is shifting the boundary of 
classification  decisions  towards  the  difficult  examples 
(He et al., 2008). 

Under-Sampling Technique 

In  the  under-sampling  method,  the  working  area  in 
the dataset is a  majority  class  where either randomly or 
by  using  some  technique  to  balance  the  classes  are 
extracted  from  the  majority  class.  The  under-sampling 
method  is  used  to  boost  the  imbalance  ratio  on 
unbalanced  data  and  classes  are  then  classified  using 
conventional classification algorithms (Kaur and Gosain, 
2018). However, it does have the benefit of reducing the 
time required to train the models because the size of the 
training data set is reduced (Seiffert et al., 2009). 

Random Under-Sampling (RUS) 

that  excludes 

the  majority-class 

Random Under-Sampling (RUS) is an under-sampling 
instances 
method 
randomly  to  balance  the  class  distribution  (Popel  et  al., 
2018). It is a technique that removes examples randomly 
from the class of majority. Given its simplicity, RUS was 
shown  to  perform  very  well.  Simplicity,  speed  and 
efficiency are the reasons for the introduction of RUS into 
the boosting process (Seiffert et al., 2009). 

Tomek Link (T-Link) 

T-Link  is  a  technique  of  under-sampling  stated  by 
Tomek. This is seen as improving the Nearest-Neighbor

class observations are deleted (Rahman et al., 2011).

AdaBoost  is  the  family's  most  influential  algorithm. 
Boosting needs bootstrapping too. There is yet some other

run more frequently than others (Breiman, 1996).

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) 

Hybrid Methods 

A  number  of  distance  measuring  methods  are  being 
adopted  in  K-nearest  neighbors.  In  the  training  results, 
KNN finds k number of nearest samples and then allows 
the  class  label  used  frequently  within  the  estimated 
training samples based on the test sample. The K-nearest 
neighbor is known for being the simplest and most non-
parametric  sample  classification  (Friedl  and  Brodley, 
1997). KNN can be mentioned as a learner based on the 
instance (Bishop, 1995). 

NaÃ¯ve Bayes 

To  simplify  the  relationship,  NaÃ¯ve  Bayes  often 
produces  strong  classification  outcomes.  Although  a  lot 
of  classification  missions,  only  one  scan  of  the  training 
data  is  required  (Mitchell,  1997).  Based  on  the  given 
class label, NaÃ¯ve Bayes estimates that. The attributes are 
independent  of  conditions  and  therefore  investigate  to 
determine  the  class  conditional  probability  (Kotu  and 
Deshpande, 2018). 

Decision Tree 

A  Decision  tree  classifies  an  unknown  test  instance 
by way of a series of decisions. Decision tree classifiers 
are widely used in many different ways, in particular for 
their  high  adaptability 
to  complex  classification 
problems  (Friedl  and  Brodley,  1997).  The  decision  tree 
is simpler and easier to enforce, so as a single classifier it 
is renowned (Farid et al., 2013). 

Ensemble Methods 

Ensemble approaches involve the synthesis of various 
methods. Ensembles  based on bagging and boosting are 

The hybrid approaches include both data sampling and 
algorithm boosting. While many data sampling techniques 
are  specifically  designed  to  address  the  problem  of  class 
imbalances, hybrid methods can improve the performance 
of  any  weak  classifier  (regardless  of  whether  the  data  is 
unbalanced) (Seiffert et al., 2009). 

SMOTEBoost 

SMOTEBoost  produces  synthetic  examples  of  the 
rare  or  minority  class,  thereby  implicitly  adjusting  the 
weights  of  updates  and  compensating  for  distorted 
distributions.  This  construct  focuses  on  the  sampled 
minority  class  examples  for  each  boosting  iteration  and 
creates new examples (Chawla et al., 2003).

efficiency  of  classification  when  data  is  imbalanced 
(Seiffert et al., 2009).

the  weight  update  formula  minimizing  the  information 
loss introduced by under-sampling (Ahmed et al., 2019).

About  half  of  the  researchers  used  just  various 
imbalance  to  test  their  machine  learning  approaches  to 
resolve the class disparity. The writers are not at fault for 
this,  as  most  of  them  have  been  concentrating  on 
addressing  a  particular  problem  or  a  benchmark 
assignment.  However,  more  rigorous  experiments  testing 
these  approaches  across  a  broader  variety  of  data  sets, 
with  differing  degrees  of  class  inequality  and  difficulty, 
would  help  explain  their  strengths  and  limitations.  Also, 
only  one-third  of  the  experiments  show  the  number  of 
rounds  or  repetitions  done  on  each  trial.  In  other  words, 
the rest of it the groups either did not conduct several runs 
or neglected to provide the specifics and reported the most 
desirable  findings.  For  their  safety,  training  a  machine 
learning model on a broad data set will take days or even 
weeks,  making  it  difficult  to  perform  many  rounds  of 
experiments.  This  opens  a  range  of  opportunities  for 
future  study,  as  applying  different  machine  learning 
approaches  to  several  data  sets  with  replication  can 
improve  confidence  in  outcomes  and  help  direct  future 
practitioners in model selection. 

The methods that have been discussed explicitly cannot 
currently  be  comparable,  since  they  are  tested  in  separate 
data  sets  with  differing  class  imbalances  and  results  with 
contradictory  performance  assessments  are  published. 
Besides,  some  studies  report  inconsistent  findings,  further 
indicating that performance is highly dependent on problem 
complexity, class representation and recorded performance 
metrics.  Overall,

method  as  superior  for  learning  from  class  imbalanced 
results  and  additional  experiments  are  needed  before  such 
conclusions can be drawn. Class imbalance is not limited to 
low or high imbalance data and further analysis needs to be 
performed to test the application of these machine learning 
class imbalance approaches in other domains.

Conclusion and Future Works 

science 

Data imbalances are a common concern. It has been a 
long time since the attention of the researchers. Uses of 
various  imbalance  dataset  classifier  techniques  are  an 
emerging  data 
study.  Existing  classifier 
performance  on  an  imbalanced  dataset  is  not  expected 
without a balancing dataset. So, we have to reprocess the 
data to make a better accuracy of results. In this survey, 
the  application  of  using  different  classifiers  has  been 
established for the classification of imbalances in results. 
This  survey  paper  has  provided  a  clear  comparison  of 
these  papers  and  a  fair  viewpoint  in  this  area,  but  this 
study  cannot  say  an  in-depth  analysis  of  those  papers. 
The following points may be useful in future research: 

ï·  System  performance  is  a  key  factor.  In  the  training 
phase,  the  removal  of  redundant  and  irrelevant 
features increases system performance 

ï· 

In  the  classification  techniques,  the  consideration 
feature selection step will play a vital role in the future 
ï·  For  performance  measurement,  uses  of  hybrid  or 
ensemble  classifiers  are  more  feasible  instead  of  a 
single classifier 

There are some areas for future work that are evident. 
Applying the newly developed methods to a wider range 
of  data  sets  and  class  imbalance  levels,  comparing 
outcomes  with  several  complementary  performance 
indicators  and  reporting  statistical  evidence  can  help  to 
define  the  optimal  deep  learning  approaches  as  well  as 
traditional  machine  learning  methods  for  future  class 
imbalance  applications.  Experimenting  with  new  hybrid 
and  cluster-based  machine  learning  approaches  along 
with deep learning approaches to fix class imbalances in 
the sense of big data and class rareness may prove useful 
for the future of big data analytics.
