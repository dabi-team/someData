ABSTRACT 

Work zone safety is influenced by many risk factors. Consequently, a comprehensive knowledge 
of the risk factors identified from crash data analysis becomes critical in reducing risk levels and 
preventing  severe  crashes  in  work  zones.  This  study  focuses  on  the  2016  severe  crashes  that 
occurred in the State of Michigan (USA) in work zones along highway I-94. The study identified 
the risk factors from a wide range of crash variables characterizing environmental, driver, crash 
and  road-related  variables.  The  impact  of  these  risk  factors  on  crash  severity  was  investigated 
using  frequency  analyses,  logistic  regression  statistics,  and  a  machine  learning  Random  Forest 
(RF)  algorithm.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  findings  of  this  study  will  help  traffic  engineers  and 
departments  of  transportation  in  developing  work  zone  countermeasures  to  improve  safety  and 
reduce the crash risk. It was found that some of these factors could be overlooked when designing 
and  devising  work  zone  traffic  control  plans.  Results  indicate,  for  example,  the  need  for 
appropriate  traffic  control  mechanisms  such  as  harmonizing  the  speed  of  vehicles  before 
approaching work zones, the need to provide illumination at specific locations of the work zone, 
and the need to establish frequent public education programs, flyers, and ads targeting high-risk 
driver groups. Moreover, the Random Forest algorithm was found to be efficient, promising, and 
recommended in crash data analysis, specifically, when the data sample size is small.

INTRODUCTION 

Highway construction activities create work zones that are disruptive to regular traffic patterns 
and generate serious safety concerns [1]. Improving safety in work zones with minimum or no 
impact on the main function of highways has been a major goal of planners, traffic engineers and 
researchers. Increasing work zone safety is shaped by a large variety of risk factors of which some 
have not been studied well [2]. Traffic safety engineers must satisfy two contrasting functions, 
namely:  protecting  the  workers  at  work  zones  to  keep  them  safe  and  effectively  maintaining  a 
stable flow of traffic through the work zones all the time. Consequently, traffic safety engineers 
need to utilize historical work zone crash data to identify the risk factors that could lead to high-
severity crashes injury and/or fatal crashes. Past studies identified several factors contributing to 
severe  work  zone  crashes;  however,  crash  characteristics  are  not  universally  the  same  for  all 
highway sections. Hence, this study addresses the crash risk factors that could lead to high-severity 
crashes, injury and/or fatal crashes, along one of the major highways in the state of Michigan in 
the United States (US), namely, Interstate 94 (I-94). The I-94 is part of the US Interstate Highway 
System and starts at the City of Port Huron in the State of Michigan and runs west through the 
Great Lakes and terminates at the US northern Great Plains in the City of Billings in the State of 
Montana.  The  highway  serves  many  areas  including  the  Metro  Detroit,  connecting  Michigan's 
largest city to its main airport in Romulus; 30 miles east of the City. 

Every year the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) exerts significant effort, time, 
and  resources  to  maintain,  rehabilitate,  and/or  construct  new  highways.  This  massive  effort  is 
expected to increase due to the deterioration of the roads as stated by the Michigan Section of the 
American Society of Civil Engineers [3]. The report gave a grade of D- for the roads and C- for 
bridges in Michigan and stated that “Based on a 2016 assessment, 39% of Michigan’s 120,000 
miles of paved roadways are rated in poor condition, 43% are rated in fair condition, and just 
18% are rated in good condition,” and “Approximately 1,234 bridges (11%) of the state’s 11,156 
bridges are structurally deficient.” 

Generally, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) [4] reported that a work zone crash 
occurred every 5.4 minutes; every day, 70 work zone crashes resulted in at least one injury; and 
every week, 12 work zone crashes resulted in at least one fatality in 2015. About 96,626 crashes 
near work zones, an increase of 7.8% over 2014, constitute 2% of all roadway fatalities in the US 
in 2015. The severity of work zone crashes is classified into three major types, according to the 
damages and type of injuries resulting from these crashes. In 2015, records show that 73% of the 
crashes were property damage only, 26.4% resulted in at least one injury, and 0.7% resulted in at 
least one fatality. The fatality percentage for non-work zone crashes in 2015, were less than the 
work zone crashes by 0.2%. 

In this study, we examined a wide range of crash variables along I-94 during construction in 
Michigan in 2016 characterizing environmental, driver, crash, and road-related variables. Through 
the examination, the risk factors that could lead to high-severity injury and/or fatal crashes were 
identified and their impact on crash severity was quantified. The impact of these risk factors on 
crash  severity  was  investigated  using  frequency  analyses,  logistic  regression  statistics,  and  a 
machine learning algorithm, namely, Random Forest (RF). The results of this study will help traffic 
engineers to better understand the risk factors and their contribution to the likelihood of having 
fatalities when a severe crash occurs in a work zone. This will help planners and traffic engineers 
in  improving  Traffic  Control  Plans  (TCPs)  for  work  zones  and  use  effective  safety 
countermeasures and temporary traffic control devices to improve safety in work zones. 

 
 
RELATED WORK 

In 2014, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) [5] reported a total of 
607 fatal work zone crashes involving 669 fatalities in the State of Michigan with 23% of these 
crashes occurring in urban interstate work zones and 20% occurring in urban arterial work zones. 
Speeding was the major factor and caused 28% of the fatalities. 

Identifying  the  significant  risk  factors  near  work  zones  has  been  studied  previously  using 
different  approaches  at  different  locations.  Li  and  Bai  [2]  identified  the  significant  risk  factors 
based on a screening process that incorporated both statistical analyses and an empirical research 
approach.  They  systematically  investigated  risk  factors  using  logistic  regression  and  frequency 
analysis techniques. The researchers examined a wide range of crash variables characterizing work 
zone settings, environmental conditions, driver characteristics, and crash information using Kansas 
work zone crash data. Sze and Song [6] examined the effect of possible risk factors contributing 
to severe injury and fatality in work zone related crashes in New Zealand. A multinomial logistic 
regression  model  was  developed  to  determine  the  association  between  crash  severity  and 
contributing factors such as the road environment, vehicle attributes, driver behavior, and crash 
circumstance. Moreover, Osman et al. [7] investigated the factors contributing to the severity of 
motorists’ injuries in passenger-car crashes in different work zone configurations using a Mixed 
Generalized  Ordered  Response  Probit  (MGORP)  modeling  framework.  Meng  et  al.  [8]  also 
developed  a  novel  probabilistic  Quantitative  Risk  Assessment  (QRA)  model  to  evaluate  the 
casualty risk combining frequency and consequences of all crash scenarios triggered by long-term 
work zone crashes. Furthermore, Ghasemzadeh and Ahmed [9] used a probit–classification tree to 
identify factors affecting work zone crash severity in adverse weather conditions using eight years 
of  work  zone  weather-related  crashes  (i.e.,  2006–2013)  in  the  State  of  Washington.  Likewise, 
Koilada  [10]  examined  and  identified  factors  that  influence  crash  injury  severity  in  work  zone 
areas using five years (2010-2014) of crash data from North Carolina. 

This  study  has  four  main  goals.  First,  update  the  information  of  2016  crash  data  and  worker 
injuries  and  fatalities  near  work  zones  on  I-94  in  Michigan.  Second,  identify  risk  factors 
contributing  to  severe  crashes  at  work  zones.  Third,  analyze  the  risk  factors  using  a  machine 
learning algorithm, which has not been used before to analyze crash severity, and compare the 
results  with  the  traditional  statistical  analysis  findings.  Finally,  develop  recommendations  to 
improve safety at work zones for motorists and workers before and during the construction project 
time. 

DATA SET 

A major step in this research is to collect the crash data and related factors in work zones along 
I-94 in Michigan. This step was achieved by utilizing MDOT maps and Michigan State Police 
crash data databases. The MDOT Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to locate and 
analyze the work zones by identifying the location and duration of 2016 construction projects on 
the Michigan highway system. On the other hand, the state police department provides the nearest 
coordinates of the crash location for every reported crash. Using the Michigan Traffic Crash Facts 
website  [11],  a  built  environment  query  was  built  based  on  two  major  factors:  period  and 
geographic location based on the road segment. The captured data could be filtered based on the 
required  information.  By  locating  these  crashes  using  GIS  on  the  MI  highway  map,  and  by 
buffering the digitized path of the construction zone, information about a crash that occurred on a 
determined area in certain times was extracted. More information can be found in [12]. 

 
 
This study focuses on the 2016 severe crashes at four construction locations, as shown in Figure 
1. We identified the at-fault drivers in the original crash database and compiled their characteristics 
and  other  necessary  crash  information  into  spreadsheets  utilizing  the  state  crash  database.  The 
collected crashes and crash-related information were organized including various variables with 
specific observations. Table 1 lists the highway maintenance work type, construction zone length, 
period, and number of crashes during construction for the four different work zones on highway 
I-94. It is worth nothing that although location 2 is the longest one, there were no crashes occurred 
near it during the construction time.

METHODS 

Crash Frequency and Severity Index 

Crash frequency is defined as the total number of crashes occurring in a location at a determined 
work zones setting. This study used the Severity Index as a measure of fatal, injury and property 
damage  crashes  [15,  16].  A  crash  severity  index  gives  an  indication  of  the  crash  severity  at  a 
location  and  is  computed  using  Equation  1  [14].  As  shown  in  the  equation,  fatal  crashes  are 
weighted 4 times injury crashes and 12 times Property-Damage Only (PDO) crashes.

𝑵 = the total number of crashes at a particular location. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Logistic Regression 

This  study  used  logistic  regression  to  assess  the  impact  of  work  zone  risk  factors.  Logistic 
regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent variable 
(Severity Index) and a wide range of work zone crash variables at the four construction sites along 
I-94. The significance of this technique in traffic safety-related studies has been recognized for 
years [2, 17-19]. 

Random Forest (RF) 

Breiman proposed RF as a new classification and regression technique in supervised learning 
[20]. RF creates an ensemble of decision trees and randomly selects a subset of features to grow 
each tree. While the tree is being grown, the data are divided by employing a criterion in several 
steps or nodes. The correlation between any two trees and the strength of each individual tree in 
the forest affect, also known as the forest error rate in classifying each tree. Practically, the mean 
squared error of the responses is used for regression. 

RF offers several advantages [20, 21]. For example, there are very few assumptions attached to 
its theory; it is considered to be robust against overfitting; it runs efficiently and relatively quickly 
with a large or small amount of data and many input variables without the need to create extra 
dummy variables; it can handle highly nonlinear variables and categorical interactions; and it ranks 
each variable’s individual contribution to the model. However, RF also has a few limitations. For 
instance, the observations must be independent, which is assumed in our case. 
RF was used in this study by applying the ‘randomForest’ package in R [22] to rank the different 
risk  factors  based  on  their  relative  importance  (i.e.  percent  increase  in  Mean  Square  Error 
(%IncMSE)). %IncMSE is computed from permuting out-of-bag (OOB) data in which for each 
tree, the prediction error on the OOB portion of the data is recorded (i.e. error rate for classification, 
or  MSE  for  regression).  Then  the  same  is  done  after  permuting  each  predictor  variable.  The 
difference  between  the  two  are  then  averaged  over  all  trees  and  normalized  by  the  standard 
deviation of the differences. Although using the %IncMSE to rank risk factors might not reveal 
the significance of a specific factor as logistic regression, it exposes a better understanding of the 
risk factors and how they could increase the likelihood of having fatalities when a severe crash 
occurs in a work zone. It might be also a suitable use for prediction purposes, which is beyond the 
scope of this study. 

Crash  data  suffer  from  some  problems  such  as  being  characterized  by  a  small  number  of 
observations,  under-reporting,  and  non-linear  relationship  bias  between  crash  indices  and 
explanatory variables. These issues are a potential source of error in modeling crash data that may 
cause incorrect estimates and inferences [23]. It is therefore crucial to implement machine learning 
to  identify  potential  explanatory  variables  and  compare  them  with  the  results  from  logistic 
analysis. Given the aforementioned advantages of RF, it was used to rank the importance of the 
environment and driver categories at the variable’s level. We chose 10,000 trees to grow in the 
RF, to ensure that every variable gets predicted sufficient times. 

ANALYSIS AND RESULTS 

The identified work zone risk factors were studied using crash frequency, logistic regression, and 
RF to understand their impact on the crash severity at four construction sites along I-94 in Michigan. 
The effect of work zone crash factors was assessed using logistic regression and RF to expose their 
impact on causing fatalities, injuries, and property damages when a severe crash occurred. These 
results  will  benefit  work  zone  traffic  control  designers  and  managers  in  providing  real  world 

 
 
insights for reducing high-risk factors in work zones and consequently mitigating crash severity 
and frequency. 

Environment Information 

Statistical test showed that all the environment variables were significant risk factors affecting 
crash severity as shown in Table 2. Moreover, using machine learning algorithm, RF, showed that 
roadway  lighting  conditions  are  the  most  important  variables  followed  by  weather  conditions. 
Although more than 68% of the crashes occurred in a good light condition, about 14% of them 
occurred in a fair condition and about 11% occurred in poor conditions. These results indicate that 
poor light conditions could increase the probability of causing a severe crash that result in fatalities 
and/or injuries. In this analysis, “good light condition” refers to daylight, “fair condition” refers to 
the  dawn,  dusk,  or  dark-with-streetlights,  and  “poor  condition”  refers  to  the  dark-without-
streetlights. In terms of weather conditions, rain was not a significant factor affecting crash severity, 
while clear, cloudy, and snow conditions were significant risk factors. This indicates that unlike 
rain, snow could increase the probability of causing fatalities and/or injuries when a severe crash 
occurs. Lighting conditions and weather conditions at the construction site were reported for most 
of the crashes. However, information about whether a deer was involved/associated in a crash was 
not reported for about 98% of the crashes, although it seems to have a significant impact on the 
crash severity based on a small percent of information reported (less than 2%). 

Driver Information 

This category mainly describes the at-fault driver age and driver error associated with the crash 
such as texting, drinking alcohol (DUI), and drug use. Although the statistical (logistic regression) 
analysis could not establish significant models for the probability of having fatalities and/or injuries 
with at-fault driver age, crash frequencies showed that young drivers (<24 years old) were involved 
in more crashes than senior drivers (>60 years old). Nevertheless, about 50% of the crashes were 
contributed by drivers between the ages of 24 and 60. Statistical tests also show that driver errors 
are significant risk factors affecting crash severity, as shown in Table 2. Error! Reference source n
ot found.Whether the at-fault driver was distracted, DUI, or using drugs are all risk factors that 
have significant impact on crash severity. In terms of the RF results, the most important factor that 
could increase the crash severity is when the driver is distracted followed by DUI. Although Drug 
use is found to be significant using logistic regression, it is the least important factor using the RF 
analysis.

Crash Information 

Crash information contains 20 different variables. The significance and importance of the total 
units  reported,  relation  to  roadway,  crash  type,  lane  departure,  and  if  the  crash  involved  a 
motorcycle, a truck, and a bus are quantified. In contrast, the significance and importance of other 
recorded variables such as how many fatalities, injuries, PDO and the worst injury reported in a 
crash were not quantified. Given that these variables were used to calculate the crash severity index; 
they  could  produce  biases  if  considered  as  independent  variables.  Moreover,  other  variables 
namely, crash investigated at scene, crash: hit-and-run, and crash: fleeing/pursuing were not also 
quantified because it does not make sense to investigate their effect as they are not related to the 
severity of a crash. Nonetheless, results show that there are about 11.35% of crashes not investigated 
at the scene, 11.08% of crashes of hit-and-run type, and relatively low percent (0.26%) of pursuit 
involved crashes. Investigating, collecting, and using accurate and comprehensive data related to 
road  crashes  are  necessary  not  only  for  analysis  but  also  for  in-depth  studying  to  identify  the 
contributory factors to have a better understanding of the “chain-of-events” [24]. Thus, a detailed 
and thorough investigation, and information required for scene reconstruction are recommended. 

Table 2 shows the crash frequency, the significance, and the importance of remaining variables. 
In general, the total units reported, the type of vehicles involved in the crash, and the crash type are 
highly correlated with crash severity. Rear-end and sideswipe same direction types of crashes were 
found  to  be  significant.  This  inherently  means  at  least  two  vehicles  were  involved  in  the  crash, 
which corresponds to the highest crash frequency in the total units reported; two units. Statistical 
tests also show that crashes are more likely to be severe if no truck, no bus, and no motorcycle were 
involved in the crash. The term “truck” refers to such heavy vehicle types as single-unit large trucks, 
truck and trailers, tractor-trailers. Although parked vehicle-involved crashes and multiple vehicle 
crashes were not frequent in the data, they were found to be significant. 

In terms of RF results, crash type was found to be the most important variable followed by if a 
motorcycle was involved in the crash, whereas lane departure was found to be the least important 
variable.  Although  six  crash  types  out  of  eight  was  found  to  be  statistically  insignificant,  RF 
quantified it as the most important variable. We hypothesize that statistical tests occasionally fail 
in  dealing  with  small  sample  sizes,  as  is  the  case  with  the  data  used  in  this  study,  because  the 
maximum likelihood estimation of parameters could produce insufficient results [25]. Nonetheless, 
RF has not only a unique advantage in dealing with small sample sizes, but also a potential for 
providing greater diversity within the forest [26, 27]. 

Road Information 

Road information variables such as number of lanes, speed limit, road condition, area of read at 
crash, traffic control, and traffic way is important to be studied as it might have an impact on the 
crash severity. Table 2 shows the crash frequency and the significance of each variable. While it 
shows that the number of traffic lanes, speed limit, and the construction activity are not significant 

 
 
 
to mitigate crash severity, other variables were found to be significant and some of them should be 
studied in detail. One significant observation is that when the crash area is a straight roadway and 
not a ramp or a median crossing, it has an impact on the severity of crashes. Road condition and 
traffic control observations seem to be the most significant factors on the crash severity and the 
most important factor resulted from the RF analysis. When the road is wet or covered by snow, 
water creates a barrier between the road and tires cause driver to lose traction and/or glide. This is 
related to the traffic control at the work zone, in which results show a 98.42% of crash frequency 
when there is no traffic signal, and it has an impact on the crash severity. In terms of the traffic way 
observations,  when  the  highway  is  divided,  median  strip,  with  traffic  barrier  and/or  a  one-way 
traffic lane, those are the two conditions that have a significant impact on crash severity. This is 
linked to the crash type analysis we discussed in the previous section, which rear-end type of crashes 
has a very high frequency nearby work zone locations. Although about 84% of the information on 
the crash location relative to the location of the warning signs were un-coded and/or errors, it is 
worth mentioning that the higher frequency (about 14%) of the crashes were reported between the 
first and last warning sign, which means it is directly related to the construction environment not to 
the traffic spilled back for example or other indirect consequences of the construction. It is also 
appealing to note that most of the information in some of these categories is either uncoded or has 
some errors when producing the data. These variables are very important and are recommended to 
be reported in the future. 

CONCLUSIONS 

The need to fix, maintain and rehabilitate highway infrastructure has been increasing in the US 
and  is  expected  to  increase  due  to  the  deterioration  of  these  facilities  over  the  years.  The  main 
challenge  to  the  US  Departments  of  Transportation  and  other  regional,  state,  and  local 
transportation agencies is to run the construction operations effectively while minimizing the impact 
of the construction of work zone operations and safety for travelers and construction workers. Work 
zone safety is affected by many risk factors and some of them might have not been fully understood 
by traffic engineers or might not be the same for different highways. Comprehensive knowledge of 
the risk factors discovered from crash data therefore becomes critical in reducing risk levels and 
preventing severe crashes in work zones. This study focuses on the severe crashes that occurred in 
work zones along I-94 in the state of Michigan, USA in 2016. This study identified the risk factors 
from a wide range of crash variables using logistic regression and RF. The findings of this study 
are valuable to traffic engineers for developing countermeasures in work zones that can alleviate 
the safety risk resulting from a wide range of factors among which some could be overlooked when 
designing and setting work zones. 

Results show that when the crash type is rear-end or sideswipe in the same direction, it has higher 
probability to be severe. As a result, it is recommended that traffic engineers favorably weigh the 
need for traffic control mechanisms to harmonize the speed of vehicles before approaching work 
zones. It is important to note that a significant number of crashes were not investigated at the scene. 
These variables are very important and are recommended to be reported in the future to provide 
insightful  recommendations,  exploration,  and  reconstruction.  Furthermore,  involvement  of  a 
motorcycle  in  a  crash  was  found  the  second  most  important  factor  in  characterizing  a  crash  as 
severe, thus, the researchers recommend a need for frequent public education programs, flyers, and 
ads orienting motorcyclists or other drivers in areas where motorcyclists are frequent. 

In terms of environmental factors, results show that poor light conditions on the road could 

 
 
increase  the  probability  of  fatalities  and/or  injuries  when  a  severe  crash  occurs.  Thus,  it  is 
recommended  that  traffic  safety  engineers  favorably  weigh  the  needs  for  illumination  giving 
drivers enough time to be aware of a construction zone. With regards to driver-related factors, the 
study  demonstrates  that  at-fault  drivers  distracted  or  driving  under  the  influence  are  the  most 
important risk factors and have significant impact on crash severity. Consequently, the researchers 
recommend a need for frequent public education programs, flyers, and ads orienting these high-
risk  driver  groups  and  a  need  to  develop  traffic  enforcement  strategies  that  result  in  better 
compliance rates.  

It is important to notice that, in some cases, more than 80% of the reported crashes does not 
have some important information (e.g. the construction activities, and the crash location relative 
to the location of the warning signs). These variables are very important and are recommended to 
be reported in the future to conclude insightful recommendations and exploration. That said, it is 
worth mentioning that the higher frequency (about 14%) of the crashes were reported between the 
first and last warning sign, which means it is directly related to the construction environment not 
to the traffic spilled back for example or other indirect consequences of the construction. 

We also used RF as a machine learning regression algorithm, beside the traditional-used logistic 
regression.  We  compared  the  results  of  RF  and  logistic  regression  in  identifying  potential 
explanatory variables. RF is found to be useful, promising, and recommended in crash data analysis, 
as they overcome the limitations of traditional statistical methods. Specifically, RF was useful in 
producing  meaningful  results  in  cases  of  small  sample  sizes  in  contrast  to  logistic  regression. 
Moreover, we also recommend using RF as a predictive model for crash data.
