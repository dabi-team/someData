Abstract

As Public Transport (PT) becomes more dynamic and demand-responsive, it increasingly depends on predictions of

transport demand. But how accurate need such predictions be for eﬀective PT operation? We address this question

through an experimental case study of PT trips in Metropolitan Copenhagen, Denmark, which we conduct independently

of any speciﬁc prediction models. First, we simulate errors in demand prediction through unbiased noise distributions that

vary considerably in shape. Using the noisy predictions, we then simulate and optimize demand-responsive PT ﬂeets via

a linear programming formulation and measure their performance. Our results suggest that the optimized performance is

mainly aﬀected by the skew of the noise distribution and the presence of infrequently large prediction errors. In particular,

the optimized performance can improve under non-Gaussian vs. Gaussian noise. We also ﬁnd that dynamic routing could
reduce trip time by at least 23% vs. static routing. This reduction is estimated at 809,000 e/year in terms of Value of

Travel Time Savings for the case study.

Introduction

Public Transport (PT) has traditionally used static itineraries that remain unchanged for months (Ceder, 2016). However,

as autonomous mobility advances and the vision of Smart Cities takes shape, the day approaches when PT becomes

dynamic, so that some itineraries are adapted to real-time transport demand (i.e., are demand-responsive) (Bösch et al.,

2018; Horažďovský et al., 2018). Meanwhile also, predictive models of transport demand are increasingly used for both

long-term and short-term traﬃc management (Hashemi & Abdelghany, 2015). Future Public Transport should thus

naturally employ predictive models for timely adaptation of service per expected transport demand.

The eﬀective operation of demand-responsive PT thus requires that transport demand be accurately estimated ahead

of time. For example, more accurate demand predictions can yield better utilization of PT resources, e.g., so that fewer

vehicles are used while travel times are also cut shorter. Conversely, errors in predicted demand might lead to sub-optimal

routing, thus resulting in the waste of energy, longer waiting times and proﬁt loss.

The main goal of this work is to study the impact of demand prediction accuracy on subsequent performance of

demand-responsive PT. To this end, we conduct a hypothetical case study of a demand-responsive PT “pilot” experiment

in Metropolitan Copenhagen, Denmark. We do so by ﬁrst simulating prediction errors through various stochastic

perturbations of travel demand, as observed through real-world PT trips. Using the noisy predictions, we then simulate

and optimize demand-responsive ﬂeets via a linear programming formulation, for various bus capacities and portions of

dynamically routed buses. Finally, we analyze the results and draw conclusions on the impact of prediction accuracy on

optimization quality.

Our case study is thus a form of Sensitivity Analysis, as we review in the next Section. However, contrary to most

other Sensitivity Analysis studies on demand-responsive PT optimization, we account for both sides of demand prediction

and dynamic routing and do so separately. Also in contrast to previous works, we consider predictive noise independently

of any speciﬁc demand estimation models, to study the impact of prediction errors once any such model has already been

ﬁtted. We use diﬀerent types of independent noise, both Gaussian and non-Gaussian, with a wide variety of statistical

parameter settings. This allows us to investigate various correlation structures in the origin-destination pairs, e.g., as

associated with non-recurrent traﬃc disruptions.

The motivation for this work is thus to oﬀer several novelties over previous research into emergent, dynamically routed

PT services. On the methodological side, we take a high-level view of the impact of predictive accuracy on such PT,

rather than use speciﬁc prediction models as in other works. This allows us to study such impacts without binding to

any particular family of models and its speciﬁc properties as in other works. For example, models that rely on lagged

information (autoregressive models, Recurrent Neural Networks, etc.) generally share some similarities in the eﬀect of

such parameters on predictive accuracy, and so our goal is to study the error distributions themselves, rather than particular

parameters, learning methods, hyper-parameter tuning, etc. In turn, this also facilitates an examination of the relationship

between optimal service quality and deviations from Gaussian predictive noise, as commonly assumed. On the practical

side, this methodology allows us to explicitly quantify gains and losses in optimizing such services under a wide variety

of possible noise distributions, without committing to a particular source of noise. That is, while predictive noise can

arise from multiple sources – e.g., modeling choices, non-recurrent traﬃc disruptions and changes in mode preferences –

we quantify its practical impact on the optimized service regardless of its sources.

The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews gaps in current studies on demand-responsive

PT optimization and uncertainty analysis. Section 3 details our experiments with simulated noise distributions and

prediction-based optimization. Section 4 then provides the experimental results and their analysis. Finally, Section 5

recaps the work by discussing the goal, methodology and main results, and Section 6 concludes with a list of key ﬁndings

and future steps.

2. Literature review

2.1. Public transport optimization

Works on PT planning and design rely traditionally on point estimates of future travel demand, obtained through manual

data collection (e.g., via transport surveys). These estimates are thus realizations from a latent (i.e., unknown) transport

demand distribution, and so are subject to uncertainty and errors. While such errors are widely acknowledged, their

subsequent eﬀects on PT performance are less quantiﬁed and discussed.

Modern works on PT optimization take advantage of advancements in big data and machine learning for demand
estimation (Krishnakumari et al., 2020; Toole et al., 2015) and real-time ﬂeet management (Hadjidimitriou et al., 2020).1

As these advancements gain traction in the PT optimization ﬁeld (Iliopoulou & Kepaptsoglou, 2019; Wang & Qing-dao-er

ji, 2019), it becomes increasingly important to study the eﬀects of demand prediction accuracy on optimization quality.

Further, these eﬀects should also be evaluated in the context of future PT, which will employ dynamically routed vehicles

for better demand-responsiveness (Bösch et al., 2018).

Motivated by these needs, we experiment with a case study of a PT ﬂeet, whose itineraries are dynamically changed

per predicted travel demand, in hourly intervals. We optimize service times under constraints of passenger preferences

and service quality via Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), as investigated in many PT optimization studies (An

& Lo, 2015; Luathep et al., 2011; Szeto & Jiang, 2014; Tong et al., 2015; Wang & Lo, 2010).

The ﬂeet in this work thus resembles Mobility-on-Demand services and similarly relies on predicted transport demand,

albeit with less ﬂexible routes and stop locations. However, whereas many such services operate on the basis of pre-

1Ref. (Iliopoulou & Kepaptsoglou, 2019) for a comprehensive review of big data applications in PT.

booked rides (Alonso-Mora et al., 2017; Hyland & Mahmassani, 2018), we do not assume any particular source of

demand observations. Accordingly, PT demands in this case study are observed only upon their realization, i.e., only

when passengers board or alight.

Contrary to previous works on PT optimization under demand uncertainty (Ukkusuri et al., 2007), we study a wide

range of possible distribution properties (e.g., skew and kurtosis). Some works further attempt to mitigate errors via

robust optimization techniques (An & Lo, 2015) and chance constraints (Wang et al., 2015). As error mitigation is not

the focus of our case study, we consider this and other extensions for future work (Section 6).

2.2.

Sensitivity analysis for demand-responsive public transport

By quantifying the impact of changes in demand prediction accuracy on subsequent PT performance, our case study is a

form of Sensitivity Analysis (SA) (Saltelli et al., 2004). Nevertheless, this work diﬀers in several respects from other SA

studies in the ﬁeld of demand-responsive PT optimization, as follows.

First, most SA studies on demand-responsive PT either treat demand as given or change it per predeﬁned levels. For

example, Huang et al. (2020) conduct an SA study for operating a demand-responsive transit service under deterministic

changes in total demand, while Winter et al. (2018) do so for an automated demand-responsive transport system. Manasra

and Toledo (2019) incorporate demand predictions within an optimization formulation and measure its sensitivity to

predeﬁned changes in demand. They note that for practical usefulness, the robustness of their formulation needs to be

further studied under non-recurrent disruptions and demand surges.

Second, SA studies on demand-responsive transit often do not explicitly deal with stochastic noise in demand estimation.

For example, Nickkar et al. (2020) measure the eﬀects of varying demand on performance of autonomous ﬂeets, but do

not deal with errors in demand estimation. Similarly, Lee (2006) optimizes a transit network under various pre-deﬁned

scenarios, without checking possible deviations from optimality due to demand estimation errors. Ibeas et al. (2014)

optimize bus capacity and headway per elastic demand, as collected from historical records, and without simulating

stochastic noise.

Contrary to the above, we conduct SA under stochastic errors in demand estimation for demand-responsive PT.

Moreover, the above works focus on developing applicable formulations for PT optimization, which motivates their

choice of conducting SA under predeﬁned levels of changes. Conversely, we do not aim to propose a directly applicable

PT optimization method, but rather use the simulated PT system to study predictive noise eﬀects from a more general

perspective, as we next explain.

2.3. Uncertainty in modeling and the normality assumption

Predictive noise follows from the existence of uncertainty in modeling (Beaudrie et al., 2016) and yields residuals, i.e.,
diﬀerences between modeled predictions and actually observed values2. Consequently, when ﬁtting predictive models, a

normality assumption is commonly employed, whereby residuals are expected to be identically and Normally distributed

(Seber & Lee, 2012). In some modeling contexts, however, residuals can be non-Gaussian (Mak, 2000). It may also be

impractical to ﬁt a model with Gaussian residuals, depending on data size and quality (Jackson & White, 2018).

The probability density of residuals can thus vary considerably in standard deviation (dispersion around the mean),

skew (asymmetry around the mean) and kurtosis (weight of tails). Multiple methods have been devised for detecting

deviations from normality, including plots, comparison of moments, and statistical tests (Thode, 2002). However, there

are far fewer works on the impact of such deviations (Ivković et al., 2020), most of which concentrate on errors in model

parameter estimates.

Nelson and Granger (1979) discovered that for economic time series, Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models

often yield residuals with markedly non-Gaussian skew and kurtosis. Davies et al. (1980) expanded on this and concluded

that the use of non-Gaussian residuals actually allows for a larger selection of models that better represent time series. In

the context of chemical analysis, Wolters and Kateman (1989) used Monte Carlo simulations to quantify errors in Least

Squares parameters under small deviations from normality.

More recently, He and Raghunathan (2009) use simulated data to examine sequential regression imputation methods

under shifted and scaled non-Gaussian distributions: Uniform, Lognormal and t-distribution. They ﬁnd that mean

performance remains quite robust, despite noticeable instability in regression coeﬃcients. To predict debt and bankruptcy

of Serbian companies, Ivković et al. (2020) simulate Exponential and Weibull distributed residuals, study the resulting

errors in LR parameter estimates, and devise transformations to reduce these errors. Pernot et al. (2020) study non-Gaussian

errors in Quantum Machine Learning models and ﬁnd that mean measures of prediction error depend signiﬁcantly on the

shape of the error distribution. They also note the need for more research into the impact of error distributions on model

reliability in general.

Similarly to the above studies, this work uses simulated perturbations of real data to study the impact of prediction

errors under diﬀerent noise distributions. However, none of the previous studies apply directly to the transport domain,

and most of them deal with deviations from normality in linear modeling. In contrast, we neither presume any particular

modeling form nor try to mitigate uncertainty, but rather examine its eﬀect on demand-responsive PT. Per common

modeling practices, we assume only that the predictive model has low bias and is evaluated through mean error measures,

as detailed in the following Sections.

2Deﬁnitions of residuals diﬀer by context and speciﬁcity (Gourieroux et al., 1987); we use a general deﬁnition that beﬁts the context in this work.

3. Experiments

3.1. Data

The data for the case study consists of PT trips from 1-Jan-2017 to 21-Dec-2018 in Metropolitan Copenhagen, Denmark.

These trips are conducted with electronic travel cards (“Rejsekort”) and so account for approximately 1/3 of all bus and

train trips. As dynamically routed Public Transport (PT) is still emerging, we consider a hypothetical “pilot” experiment,

where dynamically routed buses serve the 6 most active PT stations, depicted in Fig. 1. For these 62 − 6 = 30 Origin-

Destination (OD) pairs, the data contains 2.15 million trips, based on which we simulate various closed PT systems with

urban-scale travel distances.

We aggregate the data by counting hourly trip starts for each OD pair. Then, we draw at random N = 100 hours from

2018-Dec-1 00:00, . . . , 2018-Dec-21 23:00. The Ground Truth observations are thus the hourly trip counts for each OD

pair in these N hours. Based on the Ground Truth observations, we next simulate noisy predictions of PT demand.

3.2. Generation of noisy demand predictions

Similarly to the bulk of existing literature on non-Gaussian residuals (Section 2), we assume that the noise is generated

from continuous distributions. As such, negative PT demand values are possible and could indicate preference to use

other transport modes (e.g., bike, car, walking, etc.) over PT. Further, we use independent noise distributions, to deal with

the challenging case of unpredictable changes in correlation structure. For instance, given two OD’s that are typically

positively correlated, a non-recurrent disruption (e.g., a road block) might cause a surge in the usage of one of them along

with a steep decline in the other. The noise distributions we experiment with are all homoscedastic with standard deviation

and mesokurtic – i.e., having kurtosis below, above, or equal to N (0, 1) – as well as positive, negative and zero skew.

The distributions also vary in PDF support, which is either ﬁnite (U ), semi-inﬁnite (E, −E, W, −W) or inﬁnite (N ).

For each OD pair (o, d), shifted noise distribution D and standard deviation σ, we independently draw N samples,

3.3. Fleet optimization

Having generated noisy predictions of PT demand, we now simulate the demand-responsive PT services with varying no.

of buses, bus capacity, and percentage of dynamically routed buses. For capacity, our reference value is 110/3 ≈ 33, as

the average bus capacity in Metropolitan Copenhagen is approx. 110, and Rejsekort accounts for approx. 1/3 of all PT

trips. We vary capacity around this value as γ = 10, 20, 30, 40; the results later show that this provides suﬃcient insight

into the eﬀect of capacity variability. For percentage of dynamically routed buses, we use α = 0%, 10%, . . . , 40%.

In particular, α = 0% corresponds to a completely statically routed ﬂeet, whose performance is thus independent of

predictions and noise. Table 4 later shows that the mean and standard deviation of trip time per passenger remain stable

as α increases from 30% to 40%, hence we do not increase α further. For this case study then, conversion to dynamic

routing beyond α = 40% does not yield signiﬁcantly better routes.

Finally, we solve a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation to obtain optimal routes and ﬂeet size. This

formulation receives as input a directed graph, where nodes correspond to PT stations, and an arc between two nodes

exists if a bus can travel between the two stations. Each edge is weighted by the corresponding in-vehicle travel time.

The input also includes a set of bi-directional routes R, where for every combination of 2 or more nodes, R contains the

shortest acyclic path connecting these nodes. Given a total of π buses, the objective is to minimize both the number

of buses actually deployed and passengers’ total trip time (i.e., waiting time and in-vehicle travel time) in a given time

horizon, by assigning routes to π ≤ π of the buses. In particular, we constrain π to fulﬁll two separate requirements:

1) π buses can satisfy the predicted demand in the given time horizon, 2) π buses can satisfy demand even in the 100

historically worst-case scenarios – i.e., the 100 busiest hours, by number of trips, before 1-Dec-2018 – if they are routed

to serve all stops. In this manner, the optimized ﬂeet is likely to be feasible for the actual, ground truth demand in the

given time horizon.

We assume that passengers choose the shortest route from origin to destination, and waiting times and in-vehicle travel

times are prespeciﬁed. The optimizer ﬁrst truncates any negative predictions to zero, as negative demand implies no

passengers. Note that the noise PDFs themselves are not truncated, but rather the predictions derived from them.

that still satisﬁes the demands. The second term is the total passengers’ in-vehicle travel time, and the third term is total

passengers’ waiting time. Constraint (3) imposes ﬂow conservation, such that the ﬂow into any node of any route (from

any previous node in the route) either proceeds into the next node in the route or ﬂows out of the route through aod

rs. This

ensures that the itinerary of each passenger is complete from their origin to their destination. Constraint (4) sets the ﬂow

per boarding and alighting at a stop s. This ensures that the total ﬂow for OD pair (o, d) into node o across all routes sums

to the demand, and the total ﬂow for OD pair (o, d) out of node d across all routes sum to the same demand. Constraint (5)

ensures that when a passenger boards any route, the route and the corresponding no. of buses are selected, i.e., yrk = 1.

For example, if the ﬂow bod

rks is non-zero, then yrk must be equal to one, indicating that exactly k buses are allocated to
route r. Constraint (6) deﬁnes the capacity along all segments of all routes. Constraint (7) ensures that only one yrk is set

to 1 for each route, such that the number of buses allocated to each route is deterministic. Constraint (8) then guarantees

that the total number of buses allocated to all routes does not exceed the deployed ﬂeet size π, while constraint (9) dictates

that at least (1 − α)π buses serve route r, which is route that serves all stops. Constraint (10) imposes the maximum ﬂeet

size. Constraints (11) and (12) ensure that the ﬂeet of π buses, when routed to serve all stops, can satisfy the demand in

each of the 100 busiest hours before 1-Dec-2018 (denoted by subscript j). Finally, constraint (13) deﬁnes the possible set

of values for each decision variable. We use M = 100,000, C = 100,000 and π = 40 in this case study.

4. Results

The optimized ﬂeet sizes π = 38, 19, 13, 10 are consistent across all generated noisy demands for γ = 10, 20, 30, 40,

respectively. Table 3 further speciﬁes the no. dynamically and statically routed buses for each γ and α. This percentage

is seen to correspond to the PDFs in Fig. 2; e.g., as σ increases, −W yields the fewest negative predictions as its PDF

shifts towards the positives.

We evaluate prediction quality through two commonly used, unitless measures of mean error: Mean Absolute

Percentage Error (MAPE) and Rooted Mean Squared Normalized Error (RMSNE). These measures are deﬁned as

where ¯g is the mean of all ground truth observations. Each right-hand side follows from (1) and shows the dependency

Fig. 3 illustrates the MAPE and RMSNE after the optimizer truncates negative predictions. As expected, both MAPE

and RMSNE increase as σ increases. When ranking D from best to worst, we obtain −W ≤ W ≤ −E ≤ E ≤ N ≤ U

for MAPE vs. −W ≤ −E ≤ N ≤ U ≤ E ≤ W for RMSNE. Let us next analyze how closely the optimization

performance follows any of these rankings.

We evaluate optimization performance through several measures, all of which are based on the objective value (i.e.,

total trip time). For generalizability, our results are mostly given in relative terms. However, to give a basic sense of scale

for this case study, we begin with an absolute measure of trip time (min) per passenger. For this, let

Ti (D, σ, α, γ) :=

Fi (D, σ, γ, α)
Pi

,

(16)

where for all i = 1 . . . N , Pi is total no. passengers observed in the i’th hour, and Fi (D, σ, γ, α) is their total trip time

using the optimized ﬂeet.

Table 4 summarizes Ti (D, σ, α, γ) through its mean and SD over all i, D, σ. The mean and SD are both seen to

decrease as γ decreases and/or α increases. Hence as expected, trip times improve if more buses with lower capacity are

used and/or more of the buses are dynamically routed. We also note that the mean and SD do not vary much when further

separating by D and σ, for any ﬁxed α , γ. This is a possible consequence of using the same marginal noise distribution

for all OD pairs, so that their predicted demands shift similarly, thereby balancing each other out during ﬂeet optimization.

We now proceed to measure how much time per passenger is theoretically lost when optimizing with noisy vs. perfect

predictions, as:

Tloss (D, σ, γ, α) :=

1
N

N
(cid:88)

i=1

Fi (D, σ, γ, α) − Fi (D, 0, γ, α)
Pi

.

(17)

Fig. 4 illustrates Tloss (D, σ, γ, α) using a grid of plots, where rows are ordered by percentage of dynamic buses (α)

and columns are ordered by bus capacity (γ). We see that Tloss (D, σ, γ, α) increases when either σ or γ increases, as

expected. We also see that for any ﬁxed σ > 0, a partial order on D emerges as γ and α increase, so that −W and −E are

signiﬁcantly better than all other D, and −W < −E < N . These properties hold similarly for RMSNE but not MAPE,

as seen earlier in Fig. 3. By properties of RMSNE, this suggests that as more dynamically routed buses are involved, the

quality of routing becomes more sensitive to the presence of even a few large prediction errors – i.e., consistent predictive

accuracy is indeed essential.

Interestingly, Fig. 4 also shows that Tloss (D, σ, γ, α) generally increases when α increases, i.e., when more dynamic

buses are used for the same ﬂeet size. This holds also when normalizing Tloss by the theoretical trip time with perfect

predictions, namely:

T rel
loss (D, σ, γ, α) :=

1
N

N
(cid:88)

i=1

Fi (D, σ, γ, α) − Fi (D, 0, γ, α)
Fi (D, 0, γ, α)

,

(18)

as detailed in Table 7. Still, Tloss and T rel

loss are purely theoretical measurements, because observations cannot realistically

be used before they manifest, and the predictive mean rarely captures them perfectly.

Next, we measure the time saved per passenger when using dynamic buses (α > 0) vs. a completely statically routed

13

ﬂeet (α = 0), namely:

Tgain (D, σ, γ, α) :=

1
N

N
(cid:88)

i=1

Fi (D, σ, γ, 0%) − Fi (D, σ, γ, α)
Pi

,

(19)

as illustrated in Fig. 5. We see that Tgain generally improves as capacity and noise SD decrease and the percent of dynamic

buses increases. The only exception is Tgain (D, σ, 20, 10%) > Tgain (D, σ, 30, 20%), for any D and σ. This is explained

by Table 3: for α = 10%, both γ = 20, 30 have the same no. dynamic buses, yet there are more statically routed buses

for γ = 20 than for γ = 30.

We also see in Fig. 5 that as γ and α increase for any σ, a partial order on D again emerges, with the same properties

detected above for Tloss and RMSNE. This further supports our conclusion, that the consistency of predictive accuracy

becomes more essential as the ﬂeet becomes increasingly dynamic.

The best is Tgain (D, σ, 10, 40%) = 4 min, for

σ ≤ 0.5 and any D. The lowest is Tgain (D, 3.0, 40, 10%) = 0.1 min, for D ∈ {N , U, E}.

We further convert Tgain to an economic measure per the Danish Value of Travel Time Savings (VTTS), which
has recently been estimated at ν = 13.43 e/h (Rich & Vandet, 2019). For each α and γ, we thus take the smallest
Tgain (D, σ, γ, α) over all D , σ and multiply it by both ν (in e/min) and average no. trips per year in the studied OD
pairs. Table 5 provides the results, rounded to 1000 e/year, where the best yearly gains are at least 809,000 e (for

α = 40%, γ = 10).

Lastly, we measure the average relative gain when using a dynamic vs. completely static ﬂeet, as:

N
(cid:88)

i=1

Fi (D, σ, γ, 0%) − Fi (D, σ, γ, α)

.

(20)

This is detailed in Table 9, where in particular, the best values of T rel

5%. As a concise reference for choosing operational parameters, Fig. 6 summarizes T rel

gain are close to 27.5% while the worst are close to
gain in terms of its minimum over all
noise distributions. For instance, if operational parameters are chosen conservatively, so that each bus is large (γ = 40)

and only α = 20% of buses are dynamic, then at least 5% relative gain is achieved. However, if the ﬂeet consists of

vehicles with low capacity (γ = 10), many of which are dynamic (α = 40%), then at least 23% relative gain is achieved.

5. Discussion

The main goal of this work is to quantify the eﬀects of demand prediction accuracy on the performance of demand-

responsive Public Transport (PT). For this, we have used hourly observations of PT trips as a proxy for transport demand,

and conducted simulation experiments in two steps. First, we have simulated the output of demand prediction models by

perturbing the observations per various distributions, which cover a wide range of statistic properties. Based on these noisy

predictions, we have then used a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) with commonly used objective and constraints, to

simulate and optimize PT ﬂeets with varying no. statically and dynamically routed buses.

We have obtained that the diﬀerences in noise distributions do not account for much variability in trip time per

passenger. However, the noise distributions diﬀer noticeably in two other measures of time per passenger: 1) time

theoretically lost with noisy vs. perfect predictions, 2) time gained with dynamic vs. completely static routing. The worst

loss per passenger is 1.3 min, while the best time gain per passenger is 4 min, which is more than 27% in relative terms.
In economic terms of Value of Time Savings (VTTS), the best gains in this case study are at least 809,000 e/year.

Also in terms of time gains and losses, we have obtained that the noise distributions rank more similarly to Rooted

Squared Mean Normalized Error (RMSNE) than Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of predictions. As seen in (14)

and (15), RMSNE is dominated by exceptionally large prediction errors due to squaring, unlike MAPE. It thus appears

that exceptionally large prediction errors, even if few, can strongly inﬂuence the performance of dynamic PT optimization.

Finally, we have seen that when the common normality assumption is violated, optimization performance can not only

worsen but also improve. E.g., compared to the average gains and losses of the Gaussian distribution (N ), the Uniform

(U ) and Weibull (W) are mostly worse, whereas the Negated Weibull (−W) and Negated Exponetial (−E) are mostly

better. In conjunction with Table 1, we ﬁnd that this corresponds well to skew (rather than kurtosis), as U and W have

positive skew, while −W and −E have negative skew.

6. Conclusion

In conclusion, the key ﬁndings of this work are as follows.

1. As a PT ﬂeet becomes increasingly dynamic, the consistency of predictive accuracy becomes more essential for an

eﬀective service, i.e., to decrease temporal and economical losses and increase corresponding gains.

2. However, these gains still generally increase when using more dynamically routed buses (i.e., higher α) with less

capacity (i.e., lower γ), regardless of noise distribution.

3. The minimum relative gain is 5% when conservatively choosing α = 20% and γ = 40 vs. 23% when more

liberally choosing α = 10% and γ = 10. Fig. 6 gives a fuller reference for choosing these operational parameters.

4. Violations of the common normality assumption can in fact result in more reliable predictions, e.g., as in the case

of error distributions with a negative skew. This encourages further research to identify conditions where predictive

errors can actually improve predictive quality.

For future work, we plan to enhance the current study in several respects, as follows. We plan to also study cases

where the noise distribution incorporates correlations between the OD’s, by constructing their joint distribution (Peled

et al., 2019). We also plan to extend to the more general case of a full-scale PT ﬂeet that serves more stations, and study

how the predictive errors can be mitigated via robust optimization with chance constraints (Wang et al., 2015). We can

also incorporate travelers’ route choice behaviour by extending to a bi-modal optimization formulation (Jiang, 2021; Jiang

& Ceder, 2021). We further plan to incorporate truncated noise distributions (Greene, 2006), to account for the inherently

limited observability of PT usage (Gammelli et al., 2020), as well as investigate conditions where predictive errors improve

predictive quality. Given more computational resources, we also plan to measure the eﬀects of higher percentages of

dynamically routed buses on trip time minimization. We can also consider a stochastic optimization formulation with

recourse actions, to explicitly account for consequences of decisions made before the true travel demand is realized.
