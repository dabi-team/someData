Abstract: Enhancing existing transmission lines is a useful tool to combat transmission congestion and 

guarantee transmission security with increasing demand and boosting the renewable energy source.  This 

study  concerns  the  selection  of  lines  whose  capacity  should  be  expanded  and  by  how  much  from  the 

perspective of independent system operator (ISO) to minimize the system cost with the consideration of 

transmission line constraints and electricity generation and demand balance conditions, and incorporating 

ramp-up  and  startup  ramp  rates,  shutdown  ramp  rates,  ramp-down  rate  limits  and  minimum  up  and 

minimum  down  times.  For  that  purpose,  we  develop  the  ISO  unit  commitment  and  economic  dispatch 

model and show it as a right-hand side uncertainty multiple parametric analysis for the mixed integer linear 

programming (MILP) problem. We first relax the binary variable to continuous variables and employ the 

Lagrange  method  and  Karush-Kuhn-Tucker  conditions  to  obtain  optimal  solutions  (optimal  decision 

variables and objective function) and critical regions associated with active and inactive constraints. Further, 

we extend the traditional branch and bound method for the large-scale MILP problem by determining the 

upper  bound  of  the  problem at  each  node, then comparing  the difference between the  upper  and  lower 

bounds and reaching the approximate optimal solution within the decision makers' tolerated error range. In 

additional,  the  objective  function's  first  derivative  on  the  parameters  of  each  line  is  used  to  inform  the 

selection of lines to ease congestion and maximize social welfare. Finally, the amount of capacity upgrade 

will be chosen by balancing the cost-reduction rate of the objective function on parameters and the cost of 

the line upgrade. Our findings are supported by numerical simulation and provide transmission line planners 

with decision-making guidance.

Introduction 

Many governments and scientists prefer renewable energy to traditional fossil fuels  because it produces 

clean electricity while producing few greenhouse gases or pollutants. Currently, renewable energy accounts 

for  roughly  one-quarter  of our  global  electrical supply  (EIA  (U.S.  Energy  Information  Administration), 

2021). Hydropower is by far the most common, accounting for 83% of global renewable energy generation 

because the technology to generate electricity from water flow has existed for a long time. Wind energy 

came in second, accounting for little more than 7% of renewable electricity output, followed by biowaste 

and biomass energy (7%), geothermal energy (2%), and solar, tidal, and wave energy (1%).  

         In  addition  to  the  ongoing  increase  in  demand  for  renewable  energy,  renewable  energy  power 

generation  bears  the  characteristics  of  uncertainty  (Liu  and  Sun  et  al.,  2022;  Liu  and  Ou  et  al.,  2022). 

Renewable energy, poses new challenges, not the least of which is high volatility, which enhances supply-

side uncertainty. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are often distributed  along the grid, 

producing variable and intermittent power (Bird et al., 2013). The inability of the grid to accommodate a 

power source with such characteristics can lead to many technical problems such as current congestion, 

overvoltage,  and  stability  issues  (Brown  et  al.,  2012).  Furthermore,  with  increased  demand  for  power, 

present lines' capacity is straining to keep up, resulting in an evident problem: line congestion. Uncertainty 

in renewable energy generation and a lack of network capacity may cause a sudden increase in costs and 

jeopardizes the security of electricity availability. 

          To handle network congestion  while maintaining system security and stability, demand response, 

transmission expansion planning (TEP), and modifying the transmission capacity of existing lines can be 

employed. The TEP problem is a study of identifying new transmission lines that need to be added to an 

existing electrical system. Aiming at the uncertainty of wind turbine load and output power, Ugranli and 

Karatepe  (2016)  proposed  a  new  transmission  expansion  planning  methodology  considering  N-1 

contingency conditions and used a cluster-based probabilistic method to determine load and wind models. 

Muñoz et al. (2019) developed a new method for computing models based on dynamic thermal levels to 

maximize line current capacity using an iterative span recognition procedure based on restricted conductor 

deviation.  González  et  al.  (2022)  extended  a  multi-level  generation  and  TEP  optimization  approach  to 

analyze the impact of the emergence of the community energy sector on power system expansion. The cost 

of  increasing  the  power  grid  could  drastically  shift,  especially  if  massive  new  transmission  capacities 

support renewable energy integration (Sebastian et al., 2022).  

        Given the many changes in the way the power transmission system  is being planned and operated, 

Larruskain et al. (2006) proposed reaching higher current densities in existing transmission lines to upgrade 

transmission capacity. Increasing power carrying capability and loss reduction between the conversion of 

 
3 

AC distribution lines and DC lines can upgrade transmission capacity. (Larruskain et al., 2011; Manickam, 

2018).  It  is  estimated  that  by  2026,  the  global  investment  in  global  transmission  and  distribution 

infrastructure  is  expected  to  reach  US  $  351  billion,  and  some  of  them  will  eliminate  line  capacity 

restrictions (Mbuli et al., 2019). The expansion of the transmission capacity through the use  of existing 

lines and the right to pass is a strategy worth paying more attention to. The demand for the location approval 

and line of the new line may increase the project schedule for many years, and in some cases, it may even 

lead to the cancellation of the project. Liza et al. (2020) have developed a classification method of technical 

strategy, which can be used to increase the capacity of existing transmission corridors and determine the 

supervision  and  other  issues  that  must  be  solved  in  each  situation.  As  a  result,  increasing  current  line 

transmission  capacity  is  critical  to  meeting  the  increasingly  rising  and  uncertain  renewable  energy 

transmission demands at the lowest possible cost within a limited budget. 

         There  are  various  ways  above  to  alleviate  line  congestion  caused  by  increased  renewable  energy 

demand and uncertainty from line planning expansion and capacity increase, but there is no realistic method 

to estimate cost with increased line transmission capacity when the entire grid is operating. As a result, we 

intend to develop a model that is more suitable for actual power grid operators to measure the impact of 

increased  line  transmission  capacity,  obtain  accurate,  explicit  solutions  using  multi-parametric 

programming methods, and analyze the relationship between increased capacity (i.e., required budget) and 

decreased system cost to choose the right line(s) to relieve the pressure of line congestion. 

          Multi-parametric programming can effectively handle our problem. The parameter domain is set to 

an adjustable range of increasing line transmission capacity. The parameter analysis can produce an explicit 

piecewise affine formula for the cost of increasing line capacity and decreasing system costs. At the same 

time, the changing range of line capacity on different lines can be represented by different parameters, and 

we can know the cost-related parameter changes to select the most suitable line for capacity adjustment by 

deriving the system cost explicit expressions obtained for each line concerning parameter changes. As an 

independent  system  operator  (ISO)  in  the  electricity  market,  ISO  clears  energy  and  operates  reserves, 

commits generators with the lowest price offers based on the required demand to minimize generation costs 

or maximize social welfare, and then generates the cleared locational marginal pricing (LMP) (Chen and 

Li,  2011;  Soofi  and  Manshadi,  2022).  In  contrast  to  the  previous  power  grid  linear  economic  dispatch 

programming model (Li, 2007; Li and Bo, 2009), which focused on demand uncertainty, we include a large 

scale  of  binary  variables  in  the  unit  commitment  and  economic  dispatch  problem  to  better  reflect 

transmission line capacity upgrade and ISO's goal-minimizing system cost or maximizing social welfare. 

          Unlike the prior problem, which involved solving a single period and generating wind speed and load 

value based on their distribution to calculate Probability Distribution Function for each variable (Hemmati 

 
4 

et al., 2014; Ugranli and Karatepe, 2016). Rivotti and Pistikopoulos (2014) studied constrained dynamic 

programming for multi-stage mixed-integer linear formulations with a linear objective function. The current 

problem  is  eventually  characterized  by  a  multi-period  and  multi-parametric  mixed-integer  linear 

programming  model.  The  B&B  method  (Acevedo  and  Pistikopoulos,  1999)  and  iterating  between  two 

subproblems decomposed by the multi-parametric mixed integer linear programming (mp-MILP) problem 

(Dua  et  al.,  2001)  are  traditional  methods  for  multi-parametric  mixed  integer  programming  problems. 

However, the B&B method faces the challenge of effectively solving the problem when there are too many 

nodes/binary variables to explore because we should check all possible nodes to determine the best solution, 

which increases to the computation load because the current study only provides the lower boundary in 

each iteration by relaxing some integer decision variables to continuous variables to perform parametric 

analysis. 

          To solve the above challenges, we aim to address the following questions: 1) How can approximately 

affine  solutions  to  a  multi-period  and  multi-parametric  mixed  integer  linear  problem  with  transmission 

capacity  uncertainty  be  found  efficiently?  2)  Given  the  limited  budget,  which  lines'  capacity should  be 

upgraded and  how  much to  enhance  societal  welfare or reduce system  costs?  3)  What is the  functional 

relationship between system cost and line transmission capacity adjustment? To that purpose, we develop 

the  right-hand  side  (RHS)  parametric  analysis  MILP  problem  model  to  reflect  the  uncertainty  in  line 

transmission  capacity.  To  begin,  solve  the  relaxed  unit  commitment  and  economic  dispatch  (UCED) 

problem at each node using the classical branch and bound method and obtain the corresponding lower 

boundary.  Then,  using  our  proposed  approach,  we  will  transform  the  continuous  variables  into  binary 

variables  and  fix  them  so  that  the  upper  boundary  for  each  node  is  achieved.  Third,  to  find  the  best 

approximation solution, compare the lower and higher boundaries of each node sequentially; if the error is 

smaller than the tolerance range, the branching process is ended, and the current upper bound is our final 

approximate solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate the upper and lower 

bounds  to  achieve  the  best  approximate  solution  for  multiple  periods  of  UCED  parametric  analysis 

problems with large binary decision variables. 

         Our research makes three significant contributions: To  begin, we formulate the problem in matrix 

format and use the language technique and the KKT condition to get the best solution at each node by relax 

the binary variables (i.e., UC) to continuous variables. We use parametric analysis for MILP to develop a 

mathematical function link between system cost and expandable line capacity. We present a method for 

determining the best objective function and related critical region by utilizing active and inactive constraints 

determined through optimal language multiples. 

        Second,  multiparameter  programming  issues  using  integers  have  exponential  complexity,  which 

 
5 

means that as the number of binary variables increases, so does the computing burden and simulation time. 

Our  approach  not  only  generates  the  exact  optimal  analytical  solution  for  the  small-scale  mp-MILP 

parametric analysis problem but also produces the best approximation analytical results for the large-scale 

mp-MILP parametric analysis problem by calculating the upper and lower boundaries at each node. This is 

a valuable extension to the traditional B&B algorithm. 

        Third, enhancing existing transmission line capacity is a beneficial strategy to respond to development 

by offsetting instability and maintaining the security of transmission lines with increased demand and the 

development  of  high  uncertainty  renewable  energy  sources.  We  investigate  the  functional  relationship 

between  system  cost  and increased transmission  capacity  for multiple  periods  of  ISO's  UCED  problem 

utilizing RHS uncertainty of parametric analysis. Analyzing the first order function between the objective 

function and the parameters enables decision makers to implement suitable line capacity expansion and 

achieve the best social welfare with the least amount of investment.  

        The remainder of the work is structured as follows. Section 2 examines relevant studies. Section 3 

establishes the model and formulates the transmission line capacity expansion problem from the perspective 

of ISO utilizing the UCED problem. Section 4 discusses RHS parametric analysis for large-scale MILP 

optimization. Section 5 evaluates the proposed approach by applying it to a single-period problem and a 

24-period  IEEE-5  bus  UCED  problem.  Finally,  section  6  summarizes  the  work  and  provides 

recommendations for further research. 

2.  Literature review 

This paper discusses the implications of multi-parametric programming models, approaches for grappling 

with multi-parametric mixed integer programming problems, and the electricity market with uncertainty. 

Each of these is reviewed separately. 

2.1  Multi-parametric Programming Model 

Multi-parametric programming implications are becoming widely used in operations research. Dua et al. 

(2001)  introduced  a  model  that  considers  the  control  variables  as  optimization  variables  and  the  state 

variables  as parameters to handle engineering problems  reformulated as multi-parametric mixed-integer 

quadratic problems  (mp-MIQPs)  in mixed logical  dynamical  systems.  Later,  Dua  et  al.  (2002)  used  the 

lagrange method to solve multi-parametric quadratic problems (mp-QPs) and mp-MIQPs with a convex 

and quadratic objective function and linear constraints, using an affine expression for the optimal solution 

to systematically characterize the space of parameters by a set of optimality regions in model predictive 

and  hybrid control  problems. Gupta (2011) suggested  a new  method for multi-parametric programming 

 
 
6 

problems  based  on  the  enumeration  of  active  sets,  it  avoids  the  enumeration  procedure's  combinatorial 

explosion and makes the enumeration implicit to solve mp-QPs. 

Habibi  et  al.  (2016)  proposed  a  multi-parametric  programming  model  for  obtaining  the  explicit 

solution  to  optimal  control  problems  for  some  classes  of  hybrid  systems,  as  well  as  an  approximation 

algorithm for solving a general type of mp-MILP problems.  Avraamidou et al. (2017) defined seasonal 

demand  variability in  supply chain planning  problems  as multi-parametric  mixed-integer  bi-level  linear 

programming  problems  and  proposed  a  novel  algorithm  that  provides  an  exact,  global,  and  parametric 

solution with or without demand uncertainty.  

Mate et al. (2020) proposed an offline combinatorial approach to identify all active sets of constraints 

for the nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) problem a priori applying KKT conditions. Mate (2020) 

investigated KKT conditions to identify active constraints and presented piecewise affine control laws and 

their  accompanying  critical  regions  as  part  of  the  multi-parametric  MPC  technique  for  linear  systems. 

Shokry  et  al.  (2021)  proposed  multiparametric  programming  to  solve  chemical  process  operation 

optimization problems with unavoidable uncertain parameters. Pappas et al. (2021) proposed an algorithm 

for the exact solution of explicit nonlinear MPC problems with convex quadratic constraints based on a 

second-order Taylor approximation of Fiacco's Basic Sensitivity Theorem applied to an exact nonlinear 

MPC problem. 

 According to the above, it can be known that the multi-parametric programming model can solve the 

uncertainty  problems  in  many  fields. Unlike the  previous study,  we propose  an mp-MILP model  in  the 

multi-period electricity market to address the challenges incorporating the uncertainty of transmission line 

capacity in the UCED problem in the electricity market, which contains binary variables reflecting the unit 

commitment of generators; we characterize the problem mathematically and obtain an analytical solution. 

2.2  Multi-parametric Mixed Integer Programming Problems  

Acevedo and Pistikopoulos (1997) presented a novel branch and bound algorithm based on the solution of 

multi-parametric linear programs at each node of the tree search and special bonding procedures to solve 

MILP problems where the right-hand-side parameters  are allowed to vary respectively  to analyze  linear 

process engineering problems under uncertainty. Dua and Pistikopoulos (2000) decomposed the mp-MILP 

problem into two subproblems and then iterated between them. The first subproblem is formulated as an 

mp-LP problem by fixing integer variables, and the second subproblem is formulated as a MILP problem 

by relaxing the parameters as variables. Faísca et.al (2009) developed a method for solving the mp-MILP 

problem by changing parameters in the objective function and the RHS of the constraints and splitting the 

mp-MILP problem into two sub-problems, a master MINLP problem and a slave multi-parametric global 

 
7 

optimization problem.  

In the process of solving mp-MILP, mp-LP problem must be solved firstly. Gal and Nedoma (1972) 

was the pioneer who considered the computational aspects of the mp-LP problem, presented fundamental 

notations, theorems, and definitions, and showed how to solve the mp-LP issue. Mitsos and Barton (2009) 

introduced an enhancement of the well-known rational simplex approach for parametric LPs that involves 

fewer successive operations on rational functions. Support set invariancy and optimal partition invariancy 

were  presented  by  Hladík  (2010),  who  compared  them  to  the  classical  optimal  basis  approach  to  solve 

multi-parametric linear programming problem. Adelgren and Wiecek (2016) suggested a new two-phase 

method for addressing the multi-parametric linear complementarity problem with sufficient matrices, where 

the mp-LCP solution is invariant over each region as a function of the parameters. 

Ting et al. (2016) used MILP relaxations from multi-parametric disaggregation to construct rigorous 

relaxations of increasing complexity for the two different nonlinear formulations. Al-Shihabi et al. (2022) 

proposed a basic variable neighborhood search approach to solve the repatriation scheduling problem using 

MILP.  Nobil  et  al.  (2022)  proposed  a  MILP  model  with  an  objective  cost  function  to  determine 

homogeneous personnel shift scheduling so that the number of personnel per shift constraints is met and to 

optimize personnel scheduling with the same skills to minimize variable hospital costs.  

Crema (1997, 2002) created a method for achieving a comprehensive multi-parametric analysis by 

solving a family of ILP problems and selecting a suitable finite sequence of nonparametric MILP questions. 

Domínguez and Pistikopoulos (2010) proposed two multiparametric programming algorithms for handling 

pure integer and mixed-integer bilevel programming problems; the second algorithm targets the mixed-

integer case of the bilevel programming problem.  Oberdieck et al. (2014) proposed a new algorithm for 

solving mp-MILP problems that employ a branch and bound strategy and McCormick relaxation procedures 

to overcome the presence of bilinear terms in the model, resulting in an envelope of parametric profiles 

containing the optimal solution to the mp-MILP problem.  

We  specified  and  spliced  constraints  in  the  model  with  matrices,  both  equation  and  inequation 

constraints  were  presented  in  detail.  By  considering  the  uncertainty  of  transmission  line  capacity,  we 

investigated an effective approach for the parametric analysis in multiple periods of MILP of ISO's UCED 

scheduling problem, which has not been addressed previously. 

2.3  Power Market under Uncertainty 

In the United States, both day-ahead and real-time electricity  markets have  the market-clearing  process 

modeled as a UCED problem (ERCOT, 2020; PJM, 2021). Carrión and Arroyo (2006) presented a new 

mixed-integer linear formulation requiring fewer binary variables and constraints for the unit commitment 

 
8 

problem of thermal units. Lin et al. (2018) described a transmission and distribution network coordinated 

dynamic economic dispatch  (DED) model  and  proposed  an  efficient  decentralized  method to  solve  this 

problem  using  multi-parametric  quadratic  programming.  Wang  et  al.  (2022)  proposed  a  two-stage 

distributionally robust unit commitment framework with both regular and flexible generation resources. 

Resources  of  a  wind-thermal  DED  problem  are  fluctuating,  depending  on  the  weather  conditions 

(Zaman et.al, 2016). Moarefdoost et al. (2016) provided an alternative way to considering the uncertainty 

of  renewable  energy  sources  and  the  consequent  ramping  of  conventional  generation  by  a  robust 

reformulation of the problem. Wind and solar are highly intermittent in availability and result in uncertainty 

in demand fulfillment. The generation of these sources may be different according to the season and weather 

conditions of the day. For example, changes in the degree of heat can lead  to fluctuations in the power 

output  of  the  solar  illumination  power;  similarly,  the  target  drawn  from  the  wind  power  system  may 

suddenly change with the wind speed (Pravin et al., 2020). Prajapati et al. (2021) suggested the installation 

of an energy storage system to deal with the uncertainties causing by the high penetration of renewable 

energy sources making the power system unreliable. 

In the deregulated electricity market, Hemmati et al. (2014) established a novel method for TEP, which 

is associated with reactive power planning, reliability evaluation, and the consideration of wind and load 

uncertainty. Because stochastic programming models (SPM) couldn't solve the huge number of scenarios 

required  to  appropriately  describe  the  stochastic  and  non-dispatchable  characteristics  of  uncertain 

renewable  sources,  Zugno  and  Conejo  (2015)  substituted  SPM  with  an  adaptive  resilient  optimization 

problem. Ishizaki et al. (2020) created an energy market model based on a robust convex program, as well 

as modeling and analysis of day-ahead spatial temporal energy markets. Yang et al. (2021) proposed a novel 

model-free dynamic dispatch strategy for integrated energy systems based on improved deep reinforcement 

learning to address the issue that most  existing dynamic dispatch schemes  are limited by forecasting or 

model accuracy due to the randomness of renewable energy generation and demand. 

          From the perspective of the ISO, modeling and optimizing generators across multiple market clearing 

processes with uncertainties and incomplete information, such as load demand, raises new challenges. Li 

(2007) proposed an approach to eliminate the step change in the continuous locational marginal price curve 

with respect to load fluctuation and smooth the price curve step changes. Li and Bo (2009) introduced a 

more efficient algorithm to identify the new binding constraint and the new marginal unit set when the load 

increases. Vaskovskaya  et  al.  (2018)  employed  a  non-linear  alternating  current  power  system  model  to 

develop analytical formulae for expressing LMPs. Kara et al. (2022) proposed a stochastic local flexibility 

market  to  solve  grid  issues  such  as  voltage  deviations  and  grid  congestion  in  a  distribution  grid  under 

demand uncertainty and random bidding process. 

 
9 

Unlike the  previous  work, we  first  find  congested  lines  by  exploiting  the  relationship  between  the 

optimal solution and the uncertain parameters of line capacity, and then use parametric analysis to assess 

the  impact  of  transmission  line  capacity  increases  on  optimization  targets.  We  also  detect  which  lines' 

capacity should be improved and by how much, considerably boosting the social welfare of the system (i.e., 

maximizing social welfare through minimum investment). 

3  Model Setup and Analysis  

We made some assumptions based on Li (2007), Li and Bo (2009), and Vaskovskaya et al. (2018) to help 

clarify our model. They are listed as follows: 

1) Each bus has one generator and one load for convenience. 

2) The cost of electricity generation is linear. 

        With reference to previous papers, we constructed the following model, which is an mp-MILP model 

in equation (1).

sum  of  the  power  generation  of  all  generators  should  be  equal  to  the  sum  of  demand,  (1b)  presents 

transmission capacity limit on each line. Decision variables are constrained by startup ramp rates and ramp-

up rates in (1c), as well as by shutdown ramp rates in (1d), (1e) presents generation dispatch constrained 

by shutdown ramp rates and ramp-down rates. The relationship between the state of unit commitment (UC) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
and the UC start state is seen in (1f). Equations (1g) -(1h) denote minimum up and down time limits,  

10 

on

iT  

means minimum  on (up) time for the i-th generator,  

off

iT

 means minimum off (down) time for the i-th 

generator.  (1i)  is  the  constraint  for  the  generation  dispatch  limit  corresponding  to  the  UC  for  the  i-th 

generator in the t-th period.  

In contrast to the previous study on parametric analysis in electricity market problems using multi-

parametric linear programming, we focus on the impact of transmission line capacity uncertainty, using a 

mp-MILP method to construct and execute a more realistic model. However, the existing binary variables 

(i.e., unit commitment) will make the problem more challenging to solve. As a result, the proposed approach 

in this work shows the affine relationship between the objective function and transmission line capacity 

change with uncertainty parameters.

4  Optimization and Analysis 

To solve the RHS parametric analysis for multiple periods MILP problem, following the previous studies 

(Acevedo  and  Pistikopoulos,1997;  Oberdieck  et  al.,  2014)),  the  method  based  on  the  B&B  method  is 

employed. The proposed algorithm and related procedures are illustrated in the following steps, as indicated 

in Figure 1.

        After initializing in step zero, a fully relaxed problem must be addressed at the root node to discover 

the lower bound in the entire parameter space, as shown in Figure 1. The fully relaxed problem widens the 

range of binary variables. Now, these are continuous variables with values ranging from 0 to 1. As a result, 

the mp-MILP problem in Eq. (1) is now transforming into a multiple parametric linear programming (mp-

12 

LP) problem (2).

        Following the current work (Oberdieck et al., 2014), we combine the continuous variable representing 

power generation or economic dispatch and the binary variable representing generator UC, then include 

both  in  the  same  matrix.  This  will  lay  a  solid  foundation  for  the  subsequent  solution  of  the  Lagrange 

Multiplier Method. 

        Many auxiliary submatrices are defined in Eq. (3), such as the matrix M, which is composed of three 

submatrices made of all the coefficients information of the decision variables in the objective function. 

Submatrix 

TC , for example, has NT rows corresponding to the coefficient of per-unit electricity generation 

cost  for  all  generators  in  each  period,  submatrix 

TUC  has  NT  rows  corresponding  to  the  fixed  cost 

coefficients of UC, and submatrix  SCT  has N(T-1) rows corresponding to the coefficient of the start cost 

in the objective function.

 and providing maximal social welfare with 

minimal  investment,  we  may  choose  which  lines'  capacity  should  be  improved.  Assume  that  inside 

parameter space, the active and inactive constraints remain constant (i.e., in the given critical region). In 

that case, we will modify parameter  θk with the highest rate/slope of change of the objective function  z  

under the effect of the parameters since increasing the capacity of that line will result in maximum return 

on  investment.  This  is  yet  another  contribution  and  innovation  in  determining  the  best  candidate 

transmission line for capacity expansion. 

        Suppose  multiple  lines’  capacity  can  be  increased  simultaneously,  using  the  obtained  objective 

function and the investment cost function regarding the parameters. In that case, we will find the optimal 

solution in the following form.

        This is an optimization problem regarding multiple parametric as decision variables. We can get the 

best solutions for all uncertainty parameters, and then we adjust the transmission capacity of each line by

. As a result, the lowest cost of electricity generation is achieved within the limited budget, 

and line congestion is reduced.  

        Next,  we will  derive  the  formula for  the critical region.  Based  on  the  simplex  method,  parametric 

problems are solved by the optimal basic matrix, optimal solution, optimal value, and corresponding critical 

region derived by the simplex method since the dual solution does not depend on  for RHS parametric 

linear programming problems. Two optimal basic matrixes are considered neighboring matrices when they 

are both optimal bases for the same 

*  in parametric space. One can transform into the other one in one 

dual step (Gal and Nedoma, 1972). 

        If B is an optimal basic matrix and  m is the related index set of basic variables, then (21), which means 

that all variables must be non-negative, is the primal condition of   . In a programming problem, this is 

also the initial condition for decision variables.  

        At the same time, the parameters themselves have certain constraints shown in (22), these two sets of 

constraints  form  the  range  of  values  for  parameters     under  the  same  set  of  base  variables  (Gal  and 

Nedoma, 1972).

(22) 

        In order to use the simplex approach, we must first transform linear programming to a standard type 

through using slackness variables to convert all non-equal constraints into equation constraints. 

        When  employing  the  simplex  method,  however,  the  simplex  tableau  only  exhibits  the  equation 

constraints, not  the  variable's  possible  range  of values.  Thus, the inequality  constraints  of  Eq.  (21)  will 

display the parameters' possible space by ensuring those decision variables are non-negative. However, in 

the process of solving with the simplex method, the simplex tableau produced only reflects the equation 

constraints but does not reflect the range of values of the variables, so inequality Eq. (20) will reflect the 

range of values for the variable, it indicates that variables relate to basis 

pB  within such the range of values 

corresponding to parameters , so the constraints (20)  and (21) reflect the critical region. 

        In the Lagrange method, we do not normalize the original inequality constraints, and the inequality 

constraints contain the feasible space of the decision variables. However, we find that the inactive constraint 

is indeterminate, and under the same active constraints and different parameters, the value on the left of the 

inactive constraint will change or even not satisfy the constraint. This reflects that the parameters are within 

a certain range, and the active constraints are unchanged.

        Previous studies addressing multi-parametric linear programming problems did not describe how to 

construct  critical  regions  in  detail.  Because  the  solution  is  defined  as  a  piecewise  affine  formula  about 

parameter  in multi-parametric linear programming problems. So, we take 

*  having solved by Eq. (14) 

to inactive constraints: 

        The parameter range obtained by inequality of equation (21) is the feasible range of this critical region

        where  s  is the index set of inactive constraints in each non-overlapping critical region,  m  denotes 

the  index  of  critical  regions,  and  K  refers  the  set  of  all  feasible  parameters.     represents  the  entire

  changes  due  to  parameter 

s   variation,  both 

active and inactive constraints are altered concurrently; this allows us to obtain new variable solutions and 

critical regions until we have covered the full parameter space. This is analogous to the simplex method's 

modification in the basic variables. The basic matrix will change when the value of a basic variable goes 

negative. 

        If a new integer solution is discovered in the critical region, as shown in Figure 1, compare and update 

the upper bounds in this region before removing it from the unknown parameter space. Finally, if no solution 

is  found,  the  procedure  should  be  terminated;  this  problem  has  no  feasible  solution  because  the  full 

relaxation problem has no solution, then the mixed-integer problem will definitely be infeasible. 

1.2  Determine the upper bound 

Next, we can use the optimal solution solved by the full relaxed problem at this node to determine the upper 

boundary in parameter space with a feasible solution. This step, as the first in our approach to performing 

parametric analysis for large-scale MILP, made the model both novel and practicable. 

        1) To obtain the lower boundary of the objective function, solve a relaxed mp-LP problem. We can 

get  critical  regions  CRs ,  corresponding  optimal  decision  variables  G ,  and  objective  functions 

z 
( )

expressed in terms of parameters after solving the multi-parametric problem at each node. 

        2) To get approximate integer decision variables by applying the following rule. For each decision

1.3  Compare the objective function value of the current solution with the current upper bound

bound 

( )iz

 at the root node obtained in step 1.2 as the initial upper bound 

( )z

 of the problem.  

         For  a  particular  node  i,  comparing  the  objective  value  ˆ ( )iz
problem and the related upper boundary 

( )z

. To simplify the problem, we select some random points in 

 which  was  obtained  by  relaxing  the 

the parameter space,  Q denotes the number of random points, first calculate the upper and lower bound 

errors of each point, and then compute the final error rate using a weighted average of all selected random 

points, as shown in Equation (32).

        If there is   , the iteration will be terminated; otherwise, move on to step 2. In this case,    is an 

artificial threshold or error tolerance boundary that will be adjusted to reflect actual market objectives or 

computation time burden, which is an innovation from this study. 

Step2. Select a branching variable and update the set of nodes N 

        Choose a binary variable from U and generate two new nodes fixing variable selected to be 0 and 1. 

Add the new nodes to N, and update

(i.e., Add two nodes to a branch). 

        Set  the  unexplored parameter  space  of  these  nodes,

satisfied: 

(i)    The problem is not feasible. 

(ii)   An integer solution is found.  

(iii) The solution of the node is greater than the current best upper bound in the same space.  

This simplifies the operation steps and is easier than iterating through all the nodes in all parameter space. 

Step3.Determinne at nodes 

 If 

N   , stopping the iteration with solutions; otherwise, take node  i  from  N  and remove it from the 

 

list: 

n n  . Here, n is the number of nodes that have not been calculated.

 , go back to step 3. If the problem is feasible, determine and update the

upper bound like in step 1, the upper bound obtained at node i is recorded as

. For

smaller  upper  bound,  eventually  get  a  new  current  upper  bound

 (Dua  and  Pistikopoulos,  2000). 

Calculate the error between the optimal function value  ˆ ( )iz

 at node i and the current upper bound

method solution from Step 4. Return to step 3 and jump to an uncalculated node if all critical regions of 

node i are eliminated; otherwise, return to step 2 and build a new branch. 

5.  Case study 

The proposed methodologies and results are validated in Section 5.1 by using a single period UCED case 

to  portray  the  calculation  procedure  in  detail  through  the  synthesis  data,  which  has  two  buses  and  two 

uncertainty transmission lines. The IEEE-5 bus UCED case with 24 periods is also used in Section 5.2 to 

demonstrate the results and insights; for simplicity, we only consider one line’s capacity uncertainty.

          In this single period problem, we shall ignore the constraints for start-up ramp rate, shut-down ramp 

rate, and the relationship between UC of generators and start-up state in a single period problem, removing 

the contrasts for minimum on time and minimum off time. So, we only consider the energy balance and 

generation constraints.  In this synthesis case, two generators and two buses are connected through two 

lines. To show our methods proposed in section 4, we incorporate two uncertainty parameters on the RHS 

of the transmission lines' capacity constraints to illustrate the uncertainty of lines' capacity. Both parameters 

ranged between 0 and 10, indicating that the line's capacity can be enhanced between 0 and 10. 

We will solve this problem based on the following steps:  

 
 
 
 
 
 
          
 
 
        Step0: Initialize the collection of nodes that need to be solved, 

 
N   , 

0n  . 

        Step1: Solve the fully relaxed problem as follows (at node 0).

        Based on the results of Eq. (61), we know that the decision-maker/ ISO should increase the 0.3-unit 

capacity of the first line. The results of Eq. (61) show that 1) increasing the capacity of the second line has 

no effect on the reduction of electricity generation costs, indicating that this line is not congested; and 2) in 

the current situation, increasing the capacity of the first line by more than 0.3 capacity has no effect on the 

optimization results. 

        Step3: To sum up, we will draw the following optimal three-dimensional plane curve through MPT 

(see https://www.mpt3.org/Main/HomePage for details).

    Figure 2 is the optimal parametric analysis solution considering the uncertainty of two transmission lines' 

capacity at the root node by relaxing all binary variables to continuous variables. This is a three-dimensional 

plane,  with  the  three  dimensions  representing  theta1,  theta2,  and  z,  respectively.  The  accurate  optimal 

solution can be observed in this figure. Figure 3 depicts the relation between the parameters ( 1

problem in Eq. (31), and the obtained solution is also the optimal solution satisfying all constraints. The z-

axis  coordinate  vertex  representing  the  optimal  value  is  higher  than  the  coordinate  vertex  in  Figure  2, 

indicating that the cost at node 4 is higher than the cost obtained by the root node, which is reasonable 

because the binary variables are relaxed at the root node. 

5.2 IEEE-5 bus 24-periods UCED case 

This section applies our method to a 24-periods and IEEE-5 bus UCED problem. This problem has five 

buses  and  six  lines,  and  all  data  (i.e.,  transmission  capacity,  generation  shift  factor,  per-unit  electricity 

generation cost, etc.) is generated in MATLAB using MATPOWER. To simplify and more intuitively show 

our algorithm and conclusion, we only consider the uncertainty of the first line transmission capacity (i.e., 

parametric  analysis  MILP  problem  for  one  parameter).  By  relaxing  all  binary  variables  to  continuous 

variables at the root node between 0 and 1.  As a result, we can derive the lower boundary in the  entire 

parameter space based on linear programming parametric analysis.

          The  parameter  space  is  categorized  into five critical  regions, and  the  optimal  parametric analysis 

objective function is a piecewise affine function and split into five sub-piecewise parts. Eq. (61) reveals 

that the optimal objective function is a constant value when

       After the fully relaxed solution is obtained at the root node, employing Eq. (26) and transforming the 
0  , then fixing these variables, we 

obtained optimal continuous variables to 0 or 1. Here, we assume 

get the upper bound of the IEEE-5 bus UCED problem.

        When the upper and lower bound at the root node are obtained, we can calculate the error value in 
each critical region between  z  and  z .   Because  the current capacity of line 4 is 150MW, the first line 

segment in Eq. (62) shows that if the capacity of line 4 may be regulated between 150 and 176.145 (i.e., 

150+26.145),  raising  1(MW)  capacity  of  line  4  will  decrease  68.720651  ($).  The  third  line  segment 

indicates that by increasing line 4 capacity from 176.865 (i.e., 150+26.865) to 181.9985 (i.e., 150+31.9985), 

the system cost will be reduced by 34.360235($). The fifth line demonstrates that increasing the capacity 

of 

line  4  would  not  benefit 

the  system 

if 

the  existing  capacity 

is  already  more 

than 

194.2195(i.e.,150+44.2195=194.2195).  

         Obviously, with the increase of line’s capacity marginal effect will decrease through increasing line 

capacity will reduce the system’s cost. As a result, transmission planners or ISO must balance the marginal 

benefits  of increased line capacity  against  the  cost  of  improving  line  capacity. Decision  makers  should 

increase capacity only if the rate of system cost decline is greater than the cost of increasing per unit capacity.  

         According to the actual situation, we set     as the upper limit of the tolerance error, and the 

error  can  be  calculated  using  Eq.  (27)  as  follows.  In  this  instance,  we  compute  the  error  by  randomly 

selecting 50 values (i.e., 

50Q

 ) from each critical region.

    Because the error in each crucial zone is less than 0.006 %, which is within the tolerated range (i.e.,



   

), the iteration operation will be terminated as specified in step 1 of Section 4. So, compared to 

traditional B&B methods for exploring all potential nodes, we can conclude that the approximate optimal 

solution to this problem was obtained quickly based on the proposed method. Furthermore, the accuracy 

degree of approximation was very high, about 99.994 % for this problem.  

          Therefore, by using the MPT, we will draw the final optimal approximate results, which is the upper 

bound curve as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4: The lower and upper boundaries at root node 

The horizontal axis of the graph indicates the space of parameter theta, or the possible space for improving 

transmission line capacity, and the vertical axis represents the best objective value. The difference between 

the lower and upper bound curves represents the error from Eq. (53), and it can be seen that the distance 

between the upper and lower bounds is quite modest. The UCED example in this IEEE-5 bus 24-period 

includes 120 binary decision variables; we should evaluate enormous nodes (i.e., 2.6585e+36) using the 

classical B&B approach, which brings the simulation burden and cannot be supported in MATLAB using 

the MPT solver; the optimal solution will fall into the lower and upper bound curves in Figure 4. Based on 

our approach, only investigating one node yields the appropriate optimal solution, the upper bound curve.

This is the first study to use parametric analysis for multiple periods MILP to model transmission expansion 

planning challenges based on ISO multiple periods UCED problems. To make it more realistic, considering 

the  transmission  line  capacity  uncertainty  problem,  which  also  includes  starting  ramp  rate  restrictions, 

ramp-up rate limits, ramp-down limits, and shutdown constraints. This paper presented a novel approach 

for  performing  large-scale MILP  parametric  analysis  using  the  B&B  method to  streamline  the  solution 

process  by  extracting  an  approximate  upper  boundary  near  the  optimum  output.  The  optimal  decision 

structure theorized the classic conclusions of Acevedo  and Pistikopoulos (1997), Li and  Bo  (2009)  and 

Oberdieck et.al (2014), and it differed from conventional policies, referred to as optimal in the literature, in 

that it did not take into account the enormous binary variables. 

         Increasing existing transmission line capacity is a desirable technique for responding to development 

by  countering  instability  and  ensuring  transmission  line  security.  The  optimum  upgrade  policy  for  a 

transmission line planning problem that includes raising the capacity of existing lines corresponds to ISO's 

perspective on which lines' capacity should be increased to reduce system cost. We characterize this as a 

RHS  uncertainty  parametric  analysis  for  MILP.  We  provide  a  new  matrix  approach  that  employs  the 

classical Lagrangian function and the branch and bound algorithm. We proposed a strategy for achieving 

the relevant optimal solution and critical regions by employing optimal Lagrange multiples to specify the 

original matrix's active and inactive constraints. 

         We extended the classic B&B approach to produce the approximate analytical solution for the large-

scale MILP parametric analysis by comparing the error between the lower and upper boundaries at each 

node. By modifying the tolerated error range, the transmission planner or ISO obtains the analytically best 

solution for the small-scale UCED problem and achieves the approximate results for the large-scale UCED 

problem. In that case, the decision maker will get acceptable best results during the limited time to generate 

the best transmission capacity expansion decisions. 

        By analyzing the analytically optimal system cost function and the potential improved transmission 

capacity and comparing the cost-cutting rate to the capacity increase, decision-makers can adopt realistic 

line capacity changes and achieve minimum system cost. As a result, transmission planners or the ISO must 

balance the marginal advantages of additional line capacity against the cost of improving line capacity. 

 Building new lines or increasing the transmission capacity of existing lines can help to relieve network 

congestion while maintaining system security and stability. In our model, only the upgrading capacity of 

the  current transmission  line  is  considered. We approach  this  problem  using  multiple  parametric  MILP 

while  only  accounting  for  the  uncertainty  of  the  RHS  of  the  constraints.  Future  studies  can  address 

establishing additional lines (TEP problem) by adding new constraints and adjusting the generation shift 

 
34 

factor  (GSG)  in  the  left-hand  constraint  matrix.  The  results  of  this  paper  are  founded  based  on  the 

assumption that generators have linear generating costs. However, in many studies, such as Hua and Baldick 

(2017) and Yu et al. (2020), it is likely that the main structural results and the proposed approach of this 

paper will still hold after relaxing the sampling assumptions. Therefore, another avenue worth exploring 

would be modeling the electricity generation cost as a nonlinear function.

are obtained from the variables coefficient matrix on the left side of the original constraint, which shows 

that variables are controlled by startup ramp rates and ramp-up rates in (1c), as well as shutdown ramp rates 

and ramp-down rates in (1d) and (1e). 

The following 

state transition  matrix represents the coefficient of (1f) in the original model (1), 

represented by

State transition, min on, and min off are constraints from (1f) to (1h) expressed separately as sub-parts 

of matrix A. They are computed by using the variables coefficient matrix on the left side of the original 

constraint, which represents the minimum up (on) and down (off) time limits.

        To perform this problem via parametric analysis for the MILP approach, we first reformat the three-

period case, including two generators, two lines, and two buses. Then, we adjust the capacity of the first 

line, assigning the uncertainty parameter theta, which varies between 0 and 10.

         The detailed process of the root node full relaxation problem is described above. Then, because the 

method is very similar and the details are not presented here, we should calculate some other feasible nodes. 

The optimal values determined for each node, as well as the details of their critical regions, are shown in 

Table 1. We set the 

0 , the accuracy rate is 100%.

         This branch is terminated, and a new upper bound is established, because node 11's optimal solution 

satisfies all of the requirements of the original mp-MILP model. Because all branches have terminated at 

this point, node 11's solution is the final optimal solution.
