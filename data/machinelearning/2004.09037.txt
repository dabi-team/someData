Abstract. This is a talk given at Computers in High Energy Physics in Ade-
laide, South Australia, Australia in November 2019. It is partially intended to
explain the context of DUNE Computing for computing specialists.
The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) collaboration consists
of over 180 institutions from 33 countries. The experiment is in preparation
now with commissioning of the ﬁrst 10kT ﬁducial volume Liquid Argon TPC
expected over the period 2025-2028 and a long data taking run with 4 modules
expected from 2029 and beyond.
An active prototyping program is already in place with a short test beam run
with a 700T, 15,360 channel prototype of single-phase readout at the neutrino
platform at CERN in late 2018 and tests of a similar sized dual-phase detector
scheduled for mid-2019. The 2018 test beam run was a valuable live test of
our computing model. The detector produced raw data at rates of up to 2GB/s.
These data were stored at full rate on tape at CERN and Fermilab and replicated
at sites in the UK and Czech Republic. In total 1.2 PB of raw data from beam
and cosmic triggers were produced and reconstructed during the six week test
beam run.
Baseline predictions for the full DUNE detector data, starting in the late 2020’s
are 30-60 PB of raw data per year. In contrast to traditional HEP computational
problems, DUNE’s Liquid Argon TPC data consist of simple but very large
(many GB) 2D data objects which share many characteristics with astrophysical
images. This presents opportunities to use advances in machine learning and
pattern recognition as a frontier user of High Performance Computing facilities
capable of massively parallel processing.

1 Introduction

The DUNE will begin running in the late 2020’s. The goals of the experiment include 1)
to studying neutrino oscillations using a beam of neutrinos from Fermilab in Illinois to the
Homestake mine in Lead, South Dakota, 2) studying astrophysical neutrino sources and rare
processes and 3) understanding the physics of neutrino interactions in matter. In this talk I
will concentrate on the neutrino oscillation and supernova capabilities of the experiment and
the ways that they drive computing.

The neutrino beam from Fermilab will consist almost entirely of muon-type neutrinos
when produced. Neutrinos are known to come in (at least) 3 ﬂavors which can be distin-
guished by their interactions - electron type neutrinos produce electrons when they interact

via charged currents, muon neutrinos, muons and tau neutrinos, tau particles. But these ﬂa-
vors do not correspond to ﬁxed mass states. All 3 ﬂavors of neutrinos are mixtures of mass
states, much as light in the x direction can be considered a superposition of x(cid:48) and y(cid:48) polar-
izations along alternate axes rotated by 45 degrees. When neutrinos propagate through space,
it is the mass state that sets their wavelength and if the neutrino goes far enough, the multiple
mass states corresponding to the initial ﬂavor state will get out of phase. When the mixture is
later probed about its ﬂavor, it may give a diﬀerent answer than the neutrino that started out.
This phenomenon is neutrino oscillation and has been shown to exist in multiple experiments
since it was ﬁrst conﬁrmed in 1998[? ].

ﬂavor states. Courtesy the particlezoo.net.

Figure 2. Electron neutrino appearance signal (top) and background (bottom) as seen in the ArgoNeut
experiment[2]. In the true appearance signal, an electron is seen emerging from the primary vertex and
then showering. In the background interaction, a muon neutrino enters and produces a ﬁnal state muon
and photons, which propagate some distance before showering.

high anode (A) and cathode (C) planes, as well as the ﬁeld cage that surrounds the drift regions between
the anode and cathode planes. The blank area on the left side was added to show the proﬁle of a single
anode plane assembly (APA).

DUNE, in particular, wishes to understand the conversion of muon neutrinos created in
Illinois into electron neutrinos at a far detector (FD) in the Homestake mine in South Dakota
and compare that conversion rate between neutrino and anti-neutrino beams. The location
of the FD and energy of the neutrino beam were chosen to maximize the oscillation eﬀect.
A diﬀerence in the conversion rate for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos could be evidence for
matter-anti-matter asymmetry in the neutrino sector, a phenomenon called CP violation.

To make these measurements, we need to be able to distinguish electron neutrino inter-
actions appearing in the muon neutrino beam from the dominant muon neutrino interactions
one would expect in the absence of oscillations. Doing this requires a very large detector,
as neutrino interactions are intrinsically rare, but an extremely ﬁne grained one as well. No-
ble liquid time projection detectors, which read out large transparent volumes of liquid by
drifting electrons from interactions to charge detectors through strong electric ﬁelds, have
the needed capabilities of extremely large scale and ﬁne-grained resolution. The proposed
DUNE far-site detector will instrument four 14 × 12 × 58 meter volumes of Liquid Argon
with readout granularity of 0.5 cm. The detectors will be located 4850 ft below the surface to
lower the rate of cosmic rays traversing the detector by orders of magnitude and thus allow
sensitivity to very low energy solar and astrophysical neutrinos as well as the higher energy
neutrinos produced at Fermilab.

The neutrino beam from Fermilab will be pulsed approximately once/second 24 hrs/day
during running periods with of order 15 million pulses per year. Because neutrinos interact
extremely rarely, we expect to detect of order 7,500 neutrino interactions/year in each of 4
10 kT detector modules located at the FD site in South Dakota.

Construction of the detector halls and infrastructure for the large 10 kT ﬁducial volume
FD modules is starting now, as are design and construction of detector readout modules.
A full technical design report (TDR) for the program has recently been completed and is
available in references [3–6]. The DUNE neutrino oscillation experiment will receive beam
late in this decade with commissioning of the data acquisition systems for the ﬁrst far detector
module expected to start in 2025-26.

2 ProtoDUNE tests at CERN

Building an experiment of this size requires an extensive period of prototyping. The
Argoneut[7], MicroBooNE[8] and ICARUS[9] collaborations have demonstrated the capa-
bilities of large liquid Argon time projection chamber (TPC)s for neutrino detection on scales
between 1 and 500 ton ﬁducial mass. In preparation for the DUNE experiment, a campaign
testing proposed DUNE components in 700 ton detectors in the EHN1 hadronic test beam was
launched at CERN in 2018. Both single-phase and dual-phase prototypes were constructed
and tested.

2.1 ProtoDUNE-SP

The ProtoDUNE-SP experiment began taking data at CERN in late 2018. ProtoDUNE-SP
uses single-phase technology where ionization electrons are collected directly from the liquid
argon. The readout system consists of Anode Plane Assemblies (APA)s which each have 3
layers of wires arranged in diﬀerent directions. Each layer contains 800-1200 wires spaced
0.5 cm apart. Electrons drift from the original interaction in the Argon, through a strong
electric ﬁeld, to the wire planes and induce signals. The location in the plane of hit wires
gives one coordinate, the time the signal takes to drift to the wire from the original interaction
measures a second coordinate. The third coordinate is derived by combining information
from overlaps of signals in the 3 diﬀerent wire layers. Signals are ampliﬁed electronically
and then digitized. Figure 4 illustrates the operation of a generic liquid argon time-projection
chamber (LArTPC).

Figure 4. Diagram from [10] illustrating the signal formation in a LArTPC with three wire planes [11].
For simplicity, the signal in the ﬁrst U induction plane is omitted in the illustration.

The ProtoDUNE-SP detector consists of a 700 ton volume of liquid argon with a cathode
plane in the center and 3 APAs mounted on each edge of the liquid volume. The drift distance
is 3 m with a nominal voltage of 180kV across that distance. Each APA has 2560 channels

and each channel reads out a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) every 0.5 µsec. For
ProtoDUNE-SP the readout time appropriate for a 3 m drift was set to 3 msec, resulting
in 6000 12-bit samples per channel. The total data size for six APAs is thus 140 MB with
additional header and data from photon and external tagging systems bringing the nominal
event size up to around 180 MB. Lossless compression of the TPC readout was implemented
in the data acquisition system, resulting in a ﬁnal compressed event size of around 75 MB.

The test beam ran at rates of up to 25 Hz over a period of 6 weeks at beam momenta be-
tween 0.5 and 7 GeV/c. Time of ﬂight and Cherenkov counters provided beam ﬂavor tagging.
Around 8M total ‘physics’ events were written, with around 3M having beam tag informa-
tion. In total 850 TB of raw test beam data were written, along with one PB of commissioning
and cosmic data. These data were successfully cataloged and written to storage at both CERN
and Fermilab at rates of up to 2 GB/sec.

Thanks to signiﬁcant prior eﬀort in the liquid argon (LAr) computing and algorithms com-
munity, reconstruction software was ready to go and the ﬁrst reconstruction pass began soon
after data taking started and was complete within two weeks of the end of data taking. Those
results were extremely useful in demonstrating the capabilities of the detector and summa-
rized in Volume II of the TDR[4]. A second pass, with improved treatment of instrumental
eﬀects ranging from stuck bits to 2-D deconvolution to correction for space charge eﬀects
was completed in late 2019. Figure 5 illustrates the signal processing stage of reconstruc-
tion, where raw ADC signals have noise and stuck bits removed and are then deconvoluted
to yield gaussian hit candidates. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate full pattern recognition and event
reconstruction.

While LArTPCs beneﬁt from ﬁne granularity and a uniform detector medium, diﬀusion,
argon purity, ﬂuid ﬂow and the build up of space charge in the active medium can all introduce
distortions into the detector response. These eﬀects have all been simulated and tested in the
ProtoDUNE-SP data.

Compressed raw input event records were of order 75 MB in size and took 500-600 sec-
onds to reconstruct, of which around 180 sec was signal processing and the remainder high
level reconstruction dominated by 40-60 cosmic rays per readout. Memory footprints ranged
between 2.5 and 4 GB. Output event record sizes were reduced to 22 MB by dropping the raw
waveforms after hit ﬁnding. Reconstruction campaigns took of order 4-6 weeks (similar to the
original data taking) and utilized up to 15,000 cores on Open Science Grid (OSG)/Worldwide
LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) resources. Job submission was done through the POMS[12]
job management system developed at Fermilab. POMS supports submissions to FNAL ded-
icated resources and selected OSG and WLCG sites. Figure 8 shows the distribution of wall
hours used for reconstruction in 2019.

For reconstruction, data were streamed via xrootd[13] from dcache storage at Fermilab
to the remote sites. Despite individual processing jobs taking 15-30 hrs to complete, network
interruptions rarely caused job failures.

2.2 ProtoDUNE-DP

The ProtoDUNE-DP detector began taking data using cosmic rays in August 2019. Thanks
to preceding data challenges, those data have been successfully integrated into the full data
cataloging and reconstruction chains and are now being reconstructed as they arrive. The
ProtoDUNE-DP technology locates the readout systems above a thin layer of argon gas above
the liquid argon surface. This gas layer allows an external electric ﬁeld to accelerate the
electrons and produce gas ampliﬁcation. The result is a substantial increase in signal-to-
noise in the resulting signals, at the cost of longer electron drifts from the bottom of the
liquid volume. Figure 2.2 illustrates early data from ProtoDUNE-DP.

2.3 Conclusions from prototype tests

ProtoDUNE prototype runs are ongoing and will continue through beam tests in 2021-22
at European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Data cataloging, movement and
storage techniques were tested before the start of the ProtoDUNE-SP and ProtoDUNE-DP
runs and were able to handle the full rate of the experiments. Reconstruction algorithms were
also in place on time and were able to produce early results that led to increased understanding
of the detector and improved calibrations for a second iteration. These tests also identiﬁed

some deﬁciencies in our infrastructure, including incomplete schemes for the transmission
of conﬁguration and conditions information between the hardware operations and the oﬄine
computing. The test beam runs have been extremely valuable in allowing us to determine
which variables are important to transmit and in designing improved systems for gathering
and storing that information.

An additional run of both ProtoDUNE-SP and ProtoDUNE-DP is planned for 2021 and
2022, allowing further developing and testing of our computing infrastructure before the full
detector comes online in the late 2020’s.

3 On to full DUNE

The full DUNE FD will begin with one single phase module to be installed at Homestake
starting in the middle of this decade. High intensity neutrino and anti-neutrino beams should
arrive after a year or so of commissioning of the detector and Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility
(LBNF) beamline. This ﬁrst module will largely resemble a scaled up version of ProtoDUNE-
SP with 150 APAs distributed 2-deep at the center and long edges of the cryostat. The argon
volume will be 15×14×62 m3 with a ﬁducial mass of 10kT. Table 3 summarizes the expected
event rates and data volumes for one such detector module. Additional detector modules,
likely one dual-phase, another single-phase and one with novel technology will be added.
For now, we assume that data volumes and rates coming from other technologies will be less
than or equal to the single-phase values.

The detectors should be sensitive to neutrino interactions and radioactive decays above
an energy threshold of order 5 MeV. Unambiguous triggering may require a somewhat higher
threshold to avoid false triggers due to 39Ar decays but beam interactions in the 500-10,000
MeV range should have almost perfect detection eﬃciency. Sophisticated triggering algo-
rithms should also allow standalone detection of astrophysical sources, including higher en-
ergy solar neutrinos and supernova candidates.

The data rates will be dominated by 4,500 cosmic rays expected per module/day. These
events are vital for monitoring and aligning the detector. The next most signiﬁcant source of
events will be calibration campaigns with radioactive and neutron sources and lasers. In all

cases, the goal is to gather data from the full volume of the detector with as ﬁne a granularity
as possible.

Beam interactions themselves are expected to be quite rare, occurring in only 1/2000
beam gates. Extraction of oscillation parameters will require both the powerful electron back-
ground rejection discussed in the previous section and precise calibration of the energy scale
of the experiment, hence the much larger calibration samples.

Table 1. Data sizes and rates for diﬀerent processes in each far detector module. Uncompressed data
sizes are given. As readouts will be self-triggering an extended 5.4 ms readout window is used instead
of the 3ms for the triggered ProtoDUNE-SP runs. We assume beam uptime of 50% and 100% uptime
for non-beam science.These numbers are derived from references [15] and [16].

Overall, bottoms-up estimates yield data volumes of around 13 PB/year/module. Lossless
compression should reduce this volume and additional modules will likely increase these
rates. A maximum rate of 30PB/year across all modules and modes of operation has been
speciﬁed. We will note that 30 PB/year is an average of 1.3 GB/sec, less than the rates already
demonstrated for protoDUNE acquisition and storage. In principle, at 2.5 CPU sec/MB of
compressed input, 2000-3000 cores could keep up with these data rates but this throughput
must be maintained over many years. In addition, supernova candidates may require bursts
of much higher acquisition and processing rates. Table 2 summarizes the computational
characteristics expected for FD data.

3.1 Supernova candidates

Supernova candidates pose a unique problem for data acquisition and reconstruction. Su-
pernova physics in DUNE is discussed in some detail in the TDR[4] and only summarized
here. A classic core-collapse supernova 10 kpc away would be expected to yield around
3,000 charged-current electron neutrino interactions across 4 detector modules. The oscilla-
tion physics is not fully understand and can result in signiﬁcant modulations of the event rates
for diﬀerent neutrino types over the few tens of seconds of the burst. DUNE’s ﬁne-grained
tracking should allow signiﬁcant pointing power with the most optimistic scenario of four
modules and high electron neutrino fraction yielding pointing resolutions of less than 5 de-
grees. Figure 10 illustrates simulated signatures of supernova neutrino interactions in the far
detector. The ability to produce a reasonably fast pointing signal would be extremely valuable
to optical astronomers doing followup, especially if a supernova was in a region where dust
masks the primary optical signal. The need to be alert to supernovae and to quickly transfer
and process the data imposes signiﬁcant requirements on triggering, data transfer and recon-
struction beyond those imposed by the more regular beam-based oscillation physics. For
example, a compressed supernova readout of all four modules will be of order 184 TB in
size and take a minimum of 4 hrs to transfer over a 100 Gbs network, and then take of order
130,000 CPU-hrs for signal processing at present speeds. If processing takes the same time
as transfer, a peak of 30,000 cores would be needed.

Detector. Right) a neutral current excitation and de-excitation of an Ar nucleus by a 10 MeV neutrino.

4 Comments and Conclusions

This discussion has centered on the acquisition and fast processing of raw data from novel and
extremely large liquid argon time projection chambers. Many other computing challenges lie
ahead but were beyond the scope of this talk. These include

Simulation: particle propagation in liquid argon is reasonably fast to simulate as there are
not complicated volume boundaries to cross but simulating electron drift trajectories (and

scintillation light trajectories) in a diﬀusive, electron absorbing, moving medium immersed
in a non-uniform electric ﬁeld remains a challenging computational challenge.

Near detectors: a suite of near detectors are needed to characterize the neutrino beam as
it originates at Fermilab. These detectors are still being developed but will introduce a large
number of diﬀering detector technologies. While individual interactions are likely to be much
smaller than readouts of the far detectors, the beam cycle is of order 1 Hz and each readout
will contain multiple cosmic ray and beam interactions.

Data analysis: The small (order 100 ) group of ProtoDUNE-SP and ProtoDUNE-DP and
DUNE developers and analyzers have successfully analyzed the beam and cosmic ray data
and performed simulations needed to produce the physics sections of the TDR. We expect
analysis of the full experiment to involve many more individuals and much more data. A
campaign of training for new users and design of a suite of eﬃcient analysis tools is needed.
We have initial prototypes based on NOvA and MicroBooNE analysis.

Fortunately, DUNE is able to take advantage of the huge and heroic developments in
software and computing made for the Intensity Frontier and LHC experiments over the past
decade. We have demonstrated that, even with preliminary versions of our tools and algo-
rithms, we can quickly reconstruct and analyze data from large liquid argon TPC’s at full
rate. We look forward to an exciting and fruitful next decade.
