Abstract:  Stock  Market  can  be  easily  seen  as  one  of  the  most 
attractive  places  for  investors,  but  it  is  also  very  complex  in 
terms  of  making  trading  decisions.  Predicting  the  market  is  a 
risky venture because of the uncertainties and non-linear nature 
of the market. Deciding on the right time to trade is key to every 
successful trader as it can lead to either a huge gain of money or 
totally  a  loss  in  investment  that  will  be  recorded  as  a  careless 
trade. The aim of this research is to develop a prediction system 
for  stock  market  using  Fuzzy  Logic  Type-2  which  will  handle 
these  uncertainties  and  complexities  of  human  behaviour  in 
general when  it  comes  to  buy/hold/sell  decision  making  in  stock 
trading.  The  proposed  system  was  developed  using  VB.NET 
programming  language  as  frontend  (interfaces)  and  Microsoft 
SQL  Server  as  backend  (database).A  total  of  four  different 
technical indicators were selected for this research. The selected 
indicators  are  the  Relative  Strength  Index  (RSI),  William 
Average 
(WA),  Moving  Average  Convergence/Divergence 
(MACD),  and  Stochastic  Oscillator  (SO).These  indicators  serve 
as  input  variable  to  the  Fuzzy  System.  The  MACD  and  SO  are 
deployed as primary indicators, while the RSI and WA are used 
as  secondary  indicators.  Fibonacci  retracement  ratio  (Tuning 
Factor)  was  adopted  for  the  secondary  indicators  to  determine 
their  support  and  resistance  level  in  terms  of  making  trading 
decisions. The input variables to the Fuzzy System is fuzzified to 
“Low”,  “Medium”,  and  “High”  using  the  Triangular  and 
Gaussian  Membership  Function.  The  Mamdani  Type  Fuzzy 
Inference  rules  were  used  for  combining  the  trading  rules  for 
each  input  variable  to  the  fuzzy  system.  The  developed  system 
was  tested  using  sample  data  collected  from  ten  different 
companies  listed  on  the  Nigerian  Stock  Exchange  (NSE)  for  a 
total  of  fifty-two  periods.  The  dataset  collected  are  Opening, 
High,  Low,  and  Closing  prices  of  each  security.  These  datasets 
were  used  for  calculating  the  technical  indicators  and  also  for 
evaluating the performance of the system. The developed system 
outperformed other existing system and therefore the output can 
be  used  to  draw  inference  in  terms  of  making  buy/hold/sell 
trading decisions.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

S 

tock  Market  can  be  easily  seen  as  one  of  the  most 
attractive places for investors, but it is also very complex 
in terms of making trading decisions. It is obvious that share 
markets  are  highly  dynamic,  non-linear,  and  complex. 
Therefore, predicting the market is a risky venture because of 
the  market. 
the  uncertainties  and  non-linear  nature  of 
Deciding on the right time to trade is key to every successful 
trader as it can lead to either a huge gain of money or totally a 

loss  in  investment  that  will  be  recorded  as  a  careless  trade 
(Ahmed et al., 2007). 

taking 

into  account 

It is a well-known fact that stocks fall in price nearly as often 
as  they  raise  therefore,  traders  seek  a  system  which  can 
predict  the  best  time  to  buy,  hold,  or  sell  their  securities 
precisely 
the  nonlinearities  and 
discontinuities  of  the  factors  which  are  considered  to  impact 
stock  market.  One  important  part  of  the  market  is  that  it 
allows companies to raise money by offering stock shares and 
corporate  bonds,  it  lets  investors  participate  in  the  financial 
achievements  of  the  companies,  making  money  through  the 
dividends  (essentially,  cuts  of  the  company’s  profits)  the 
shares pay out and by selling appreciated stocks at a profit, or 
a capital gain. The downside is that investors can lose  money 
if  the  share  price  falls  or  depreciates,  if  that  happens,  the 
investor then have to sell the shares at a loss. It is important to 
note  that  factors  like;  Demand  and  Supply,  Government 
Policies,  Management  Profile,  War  and  Terrorism,  Natural 
Disasters  or  even  Scandal  can  change  the  direction  of  the 
market to either bull or bear. 

Stock  market  prediction  is  a  challenging  real-world  problem 
as  the  prediction  model  is  trained  on  data  with  uncertainties 
and fluctuations, yet it is one of the most attractive places for 
any  investor.  The  Nigerian  Stock  Exchange  (NSE)  is  one  of 
the stock indices in the world that posies a lot of benefits to its 
traders but also, predicting its outcome correctly is one of the 
most  challenging  tasks  because  of  the  nature  of  the  market 
uncertainties. Predicting stock market had always been a risky 
gamble yet many sees it as a good investment destination for 
high  profit  making.  However,  as  the  expectation  of  profit  is 
high, it also comes with a high-risk implication. Basic model 
of  predictions  looks  at  the  past  financial  performance  of  a 
company,  behaviour  of  the  economy  as  a  whole  and  the 
industry  in  which  the  company  belongs.  Some  even  use  the 
the  directors 
the  past  performance  of 
knowledge  of 
(Rajendran  et  al.,  2014).  In  stock  market,  most  of  the  noise 
comes  from  forecasters  and  economists,  making  market 
predictions about the next big boom or bust. Basically, neither     
an  expert  nor  amateur  has  the  least  idea  what  is  going  to 
happen  with  the  economy  in  the  future.  The  problems  of 
predicting the stock market can be in the form of:

II. RELATED WORK 

Over  the  years,  aside  the  fundamental  analysis  methods  that 
were  used  to  recognise  and  predict  market  fluctuations,  in 
recent  years,  more attention had been  moved to the applying 
the  various  A.I  techniques  in  predicting  the  stock  market. 
Survey  of  different  A.I  techniques  is  aimed  to  better 
understanding  and  predicting  of  stock  indexes.  The  most 
popular of them all are the data mining, neuron-fuzzy systems, 
neural  networks,  and  fuzzy  logic  (Preethi  &  Santhi,  2012). 
Several  other  researchers  have  used  neural  network  for 
solving stock market analysis and prediction problem as well. 
In addition, the results reported by (Ahmed et al., 2007) were 
more  satisfactory  and  efficient  than  other  statistical  methods 
used  for  stock  prediction.  However,  recent  researchers 
proposed  to  combine  both  the  stock-related  events  from  web 
news and users’ sentiments from social media and investigate 
their joint impacts on  stock  movements  via a coupled  matrix 
and 
tensor  factorization  framework.  Their  model  was 
evaluated on two data sets, which are the China A-share stock 
market data  and the HK stock  market data. The results show 
that the proposed method can achieve accuracy of 62.5% and 
61.7%  respectively.  The  method  does  not  only  show 
superiority in performance, but also requires fewer parameters 
to tune (Zhang et al., 2018). 

An hybrid approach of time series forecasting of stock prices 
with  the  aid  of  data  discretization  based  on  fuzzistics  was 
proposed by (Pai & Kar, 2019). The study uses the first order 
fuzzy  rule  generation  and  performed  reduction  of  rule  set 
using rough set theory. Predicting of the time series data was 
computed from defuzzification using reduced rule base and its 
historical  data  evidences.  The  method  was  tested  on  the 
closing  price  of  stock  index  for  three-time  series  data  (BSE, 
NYSE,  and  TAIEX)  as  experimental  dataset.  The  results 
prove effective in terms of stock forecasting. 

The need to combine multiple existing techniques into a much 
robust  model  for  prediction  which  can  handle  various 
scenarios  that can benefit investors  was proposed by (Pathak 
&  Shetty,  2019).  The  study  uses  existing  techniques  such  as 
the  sentiment  analysis  or  neural  network,  and  fuzzy  logic  to 
narrow  their  approach.  By  combining  both  techniques,  the 
proposed

A  group  of  Nigerian  researchers  investigated  the  predictive 
capabilities  of  the  FIS  on  stocks  that  are  listed  on  Nigerian 
Stock Exchange (NSE) within the space of two-months. Their

based fuzzy system to provide the buy sell or hold decision for 

Researchers  from  the  University  of  Lagos  Nigeria  deployed 
fuzzy  inference  to  stock  market.  The  study  applied  technical 
analysis  to  aid  the  decision-making  process  of  the  market  in 
order  to  deal  with  probability.  The  study  uses  four  technical 
indicators as input variable to the FIS, their fuzzy rules are a 
combination  of  the  trading  rules  for  each  of  the  indicators 
used  as  the  input  variables  of  the  FIS  and  for  all  the  four 
technical  indicators  used.  Their  system  generates  a  suitable 
recommendation  to  investors  in  terms  of  buy,  sell  or  hold 
securities. Their result is equated with real time data collected 
from the NSE (Ijegwa et al., 2014). 

In  Rapheal  &  Bhattacharya  (2020)  paper  “A  Study  on  the 
Effect  of  Fuzzy  Membership  Function  on  Fuzzified  RIPPER 
for  Stock  Market  Prediction”.  They  attempted  to  find  a 
membership  function  with  least  error  of  prediction  for  a 
fuzzified  RIPPER  hybrid  model  for  stock  market  prediction. 
Their prediction was done using a hybrid model of FRBS and 
RIPPER  to  predict  the  stock  market  prices.  They  used  three 
different membership functions to the FRBS, namely; triangle, 
trapezoidal  and  Gaussian  membership  functions.  Their 
parameters  and  functions  were  designed  to  predict  the  stock 
prices  and  then,  their  MAPE  is  calculated  to  determine  the 
membership  function  that  gives  the  least  error.  Their  hybrid 
model  was  used  to  predict  the  stock  prices  of  four  data  sets 
and  the  MAPE  error  was  calculated  for  all  the  membership 
functions. 

Jankova & Dostal (2021) presented a paper which focused on 
the  forecast  of  stock  markets  of  the  Central  European 
countries,  known  as  V4,  by  the  means  of  soft  computing. 
Their model was constructed by a combination of fuzzy logic 
and artificial neural networks. The model used a total of four 
SAX, PX, BUX, WIG stock indices differing in their liquidity 
and  efficiency  are  selected  for  the  forecast.  They  used  the 
method of analysis, synthesis and techniques of mathematical 
neuro-fuzzy  modelling  to  achieve  their  goal.  They  proposed 
neuro-fuzzy  decision-making  model  consist  of  three  input 
variables,  one  block  of  rules  (with  21  fuzzy  rules)  and  one 
output  variable  predicting  the  normalized  price  of  stock 
indexes  of  the  selected  countries.  Their  input  variables  have 
three attributes (L-large, M-medium, and S-small). Their aim 
was to create a model suitable for forecasting stock indices of 
the  Central  European  countries  with  a  relatively  low  error. 
The  developed  ANFIS  model  shows  a  strong  predictive 
capacity of both efficient and less efficient stock markets. 

III. FUZZY LOGIC TECHNIQUES 

Fuzzy  Logic  is  an  artificial  intelligence  model  or  technique 
used  in  predicting  uncertainties.  The  word  “Fuzzy"  itself 
means confused, hazy, blurred or not clear. Type-2 Fuzzy Set 
was proposed in 1975 by Prof. Lotfi .A. Zadeh. Type-2 Fuzzy 
Set  is  a  more  sophisticated  kind  of  Fuzzy  Set  which  is 
designed  to  handle  more  uncertainty  (Zadeh,  1975).    Fuzzy 
logic  ranges  from  0-1  and  it  defines  the  degree  to  which  a

statement is either true or false (1 denoted absolutely true, and 
0  represents  absolutely  false)  unlike  the  traditional  binary 
logic  statement  which  is  either  (1  or  0)  true  or  false.  Fuzzy 
sets  enable  one  to  work  in  uncertainty  and  ambiguous 
situations  and  solve  ill-posed  problem  or  problems  with 
incomplete information. 

With  the  uncertainties  and  ambiguities  in  stock  trading, 
deploying  Fuzzy  Logic  in  such  situations  will  help  solve  the 
ill-posed  problem  even  with  incomplete  information.  The 
application of Fuzzy Logic (problem domain) to stock market 
(application  domain)  aid  predicting  buy/hold/sell  trading 
decisions  for  the  listed  securities  of  NSE  in  a  more  accurate 
manner,  dealing  with  the  uncertainties,  noise,  nonlinearity, 
and ambiguity of the stock market.

Two membership functions are adopted in this research. These

the  Triangular  Membership 
Function  which  is  adopted  for  the  Relative  Strength  Index 
(RSI)  and  the  Stochastic  Oscillator  (SO),  while  the  Gaussian

(WA).  The  membership  function  associated  with  the  various 
input  variables  (technical  indicators)  to  the  Fuzzy  Inference

Input Variables to the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) 

The Fuzzy Inference model in the proposed system takes input 
variables (indicators) and constructs fuzzy stock trading rules. 
Such rules can be in the form as: 

IF  countries  economic  conditions  are  bad  AND  the  RSI  is 
high  AND  the  MACD  is  high  AND  SO  is  high  THEN  the 
output of the system will signal a sell. 

The proposed system generates output by accepting fuzzified 
inputs,  and  then  executes  the  entire  IF-THEN  rules  from  the 
predefined  rule  collection  designed  to  capture  the  reasoning 
process from the rule base. The design of the proposed system 
shows how the historical tick prices of a stock from database 
are  used  to  form  the  various  indicators  which  then  serve  as 
input  variable  to  the  Fuzzy  System.  The  output  of  the  Fuzzy 
System  will aid decision  making on  whether to buy/hold/sell 
security is based on the calculated indicators. The architecture 
of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 2. 

Fig. 2 Proposed System Architecture 

Pre-processing Module: The inputs (security tick prices) from 
database  are  preprocessed  to  form  the  various  technical 
indicators  (MACD,  RSI,  SO,  and  WA)  selected  for  this 
research.  These  indicators  are  formed  using  the  parameters 
available in literature specified based on the default guidelines 
in  technical  analysis  when  predicting  stock  market.  The 
summary of the parameters used to form the various selected 
technical  indicators  for  the  proposed  Stock  Market  Analysis 
and Prediction System are listed in Table 2.

will be subdivided to form both the primary (MACD and SO) 
and secondary (RSI and WA) indicators. The secondary (RSI 
and  WA)  indicators  will  be  divided  by  89,  and  their  results 
will be compared to the tuning factor  which is the  Fibonacci 
retracement  ratios  of  23.6%,  38.2%,  and  61%.  Both  the 
primary  and  secondary  indicators  will  form  the  inputs  to  the 
Fuzzy  System, but first they  will be  compared to the various 
Fibonacci  retracement  ratios.  The  calculation  of 
these 
indicators  selected  for  this  research  is  fully  based  on  the 
default  guideline  when  predicting  stock  market  using 
technical analysis. 

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) 

The  MACD  indicator  is  calculated  based  on  exponential 
moving  average  (Kamath,  2012).    In  calculating  the  MACD, 
the  Exponential  Moving  Average  (EMA)  of  26  days  for  the 
closing share price will be calculated which is known as long-
term average, while the EMA of 12 days for the closing share 
price will be calculated and it is known as short-term average.  
9 days EMA of the MACD itself is known as the signal line 
(Marques et al., 2010).  

Before calculating MACD, first calculate the Simple Moving 
Average (SMA), and then calculate the EMA. 

The  Simple  Moving  Average  (SMA)  is  calculated  by 
summing  all  closing  prices  starting  from  the  current  interval 
looking back to the last selected intervals, then divide it by the 
total  number  of  selected  interval.  The  formula  for  Simple 
Moving Average (SMA) is shown in Equation 2. 

𝑆𝑀𝐴 =  

 (𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠  𝑓𝑜𝑟  𝑛 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑠 )

𝑛 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑠

Equation (2) 

Note  n  in  the  case  of  this  research  stands  for  number  of 
periods which is needed to calculate the SMA. 

The formula for calculating the Exponential Moving Average 
(EMA) is shown in Equation 3. 

𝐸𝑀𝐴 =  

( 𝐶𝐶𝑃−𝑆𝑀𝐴 ∗2∗  𝑛+1 

(𝑛+1)

Equation (3) 

Where  CCP  is  the  current  closing  price,  SMA  is  the  Simple 
Moving Average, and n is the number of periods needed.  

Finally,  the  formula  for  calculating  the  Moving  Average 
Convergence Divergence (MACD) is shown in Equation 4. 

𝑀𝐴𝐶𝐷 = 𝐸𝑀𝐴12(𝑡) −   𝐸𝑀𝐴26 𝑡    

Equation (4) 

Relative Strength Index (RSI) 

The  RSI  calculation  depends  on  the  SMA  and  the  closing 
prices  of  the  stock  for  a  given  period.  The  formula  for 
calculating RSI is shown in Equation 5. 

𝑅𝑆𝐼 = 100 −

100

1 + 𝑅𝑆

(5) 

Where RS is the Average Gain divided by the Average Loss. 
The  RSI  is  use  to  indicates  the  strength  of  current  trend. 
However,  21  trading  periods  are  selected  instead  of  the 

normal 14 periods. This is because 21 is a Fibonacci number, 
and a threshold value of 30 will be also taken. If the RSI value 
rise over its threshold, then it will indicate a buy signal, also if 
RSI falls below threshold it will indicate a sell signal. 

Stochastic Oscillator (SO) 

The SO is a momentum indicator which compares the closing 
price  of  a  security  to  the  range  of  its  prices  over  time.  The 
formula for calculating Stochastic Oscillator is given by: 

%𝐾 =

 𝐶𝑃−𝐿𝐿𝑃 

(𝐻𝐻𝑃 −𝐿𝐿𝑃)

∗ 100 

(6) 

Where CP is the most recent closing price, LLP is the lowest 
low-price value of the N previous trading periods, HHP is the 
highest high price value traded during the same N period, %K 
is the current market rate, and %D is a3 point moving average 
of  %K.  Traditionally,  transaction  signals  are  created  when 
%K crosses through the %D. 

Williams Average (WA) 

The WA calculation is based on current closing price, highest 
high price and lowest low prices. The formula for calculating 
Williams Average is given by: 

𝑊𝐴 =

𝐻𝐶

𝐻𝐿

∗ (−100) 

(7) 

Where  HC  is  calculated  by  subtracting  current  closing  price 
from  highest  high  price,  and  HL  is  calculated  by  subtracting 
lowest low price from highest high price. 

Tuning Factor 

The  tuning  factor  deployed  for  this  research  is  Fibonacci 
retracement  ratio.  Fibonacci  sequence  is  natural  numbers 
defined recursively  which can be  described in two  ways (i.e. 
with  or  without  0  as  a  first  digit  in  the  sequence).  The  first 
digit is 0 and the next is 1, and its next digit is always the sum 
of  the  two  previous  digits.  Using  the  calculated  results  from 
the  indicators  themselves  does  not  give  an  optimal  result  for 
all  types  of  stock  listed  in  the  Nigerian  Stock  Exchange 
(NSE). Hence, Fibonacci retracement is applied to the results 
of the secondary (RSI and WA) indicators for this research to 
help in identifying the support and resistance level of a given 
indicator  (whether  or  not  we  are  making  the  right  decision 
before trading). The usage of Fibonacci retracement ratios on 
stock prediction for this research is connected to coefficients, 
which are used to determine appropriate formations associated 
with  the  golden  ratio.  The  value  of  the  golden  ratio  is  given 
as: 

𝐹61.8% =     

1+ 5
2

−1

= 0.6180 

 (8) 

For this research, the Fibonacci ratios used are 23.6%, 38.2%, 
and the golden ratio which is 61.8%.23%, 38%, and 61.8% of 
the  results  of  a  given  secondary  indicators  will  be  taken  and 
compare  the  various  Fibonacci  retracement  ratio  of  that 
indicator. The 23%, 38%, and 61.8% represent low, medium, 
and  high  respectively.  The  idea  generally  is  to  buy  on  a

retracement  Fibonacci  support  level  when  the  market  is 
trending  up  and  sell  on  a  retracement  Fibonacci  when  is 
trending  downwards.  Applying  Fibonacci  studies  to  the 
secondary  indicators  does  not  provide  magic  solution  for 
traders;  rather  it  was  deployed  in  an  attempt  to  dismiss 
uncertainties 

System  Design  Method:  The  proposed  system  is  designed 
using  the  Object  Oriented  Design  method  which  is  concern 
about  solving  the  problems  facing  brokers,  investors,  or  any 
terms  of  making 
interested  NSE  market  player 
buy/hold/sell  decisions.  The  system  is  modeled  using  the 
unified  modeling  language  (UML).  The  use  case  of  the 
proposed system is shown in Fig. 3.

IV. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION 

This  section  expresses  how  the  physical  design  of  proposed 
system is built. The goal for implementation of this research is 
to  show  all  activities  and  stepwise  procedures  that  are 
followed  in  terms  of  bringing  the  design  of  the  proposed 
system into actualization. The activities involved in this stage 
include the hardware and software requirements identification, 
bearing  in  mind  both  the  functional  and  non-functional 
requirements. 

There  are  several  classifications  of  requirements  that  are 
needed for the proposed system to be implemented. Basically, 
the  efficiency  of  performance  of  any  information  system  is 
dependent  on  some  requirements  which  are  needed  to  be 
satisfied.  These  requirements  are  classified  into  hard  and 
software  requirement.  The  hardware  requirements  are  the 
basic  components  and  peripherals,  minimum  of  1GB  RAM, 
with  processor  speed  of  1Ghz  minimum.  The  software 
requirements are basically SQL server database, and the .Net 
Framework 2.0 or higher. 

The proposed (Stock Market Prediction) system is developed 
in  accordance  which  the  specified  hardware  and  software 
requirement  stated.  Certain  tools  were  used  in  achieving  the 
proposed Stock Market Prediction System. These tools are: 

1)  Visual Basic .Net: The interface designs and coding 
of  the  proposed  system  is  archived  using  Visual 
Basic .Net (VB.Net) programming language. In other 
to  run  the  developed  application,  the  setup  or 

executable  file  show  be  installed  on  the  local  drive 
(C:\) of the system. 

2)  Structured  Query  Language:  The  database  designed 
is archived using Structured Query Language (SQL) 
Management  Studio.  For  storage  access, 
the 
developed system should be connected to an already 
existing  SQL  database.  This  connection  is  done 
through  a  popup 
first-time 
installation. See Appendix B. 

for  every 

form 

3)  Microsoft  Office  2007:  For  effective  importation  of 
data  in  excel  format,  MS  Office  2007  should  be 
install on the system running the application. 

V.  DATASET DESCRIPTION 

The  proposed  system  uses  the  stock  price  of  the  Nigerian 
Stock  Exchange  (NSE)  for  Dangote  Cement  Plc,  Flour  Mills 
Nig.  Plc,  Access  Bank  Plc,  Cham  Plc,  Guaranty  Trust  Bank 
Plc, Nigerian Brew. Plc, Julius Berger Nig. Plc, Guinness Nig. 
Plc, AG Leventis Nigeria Plc, and Forte Oil Plc to analyzed its 
performance. These companies present the system with stock 
movement  for  a  total  of  52  trading  periods  (15  days  per 
period), thereby generating five stock price datasets (Opening, 
High,  Low,  Closing, and Volume)  for each of the 52 trading 
periods. 

VI. RESULTS AND DESCUSSION 

The results of the developed Stock Market Prediction System 
are  tabulated  in  Table  3.  The  table  captured  the  Company 
Symbol as listed on NSE, and the Fuzzy Output. The dataset 
that was used to calculate the selected technical indicators for 
this  research  were  gathered  from  ten  different  organizations 
listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for a total of 52 
period (from 3rdJan 2017 to 23rd March 2020).

VIII. CONCLUSION 

Predicting stock market correctly is a very serious problem in 
our  society  as  it  can  lead  to  either  a  huge  loss  or  gain  of 
finance  as  companies  tries  to  raise  funds  by  giving  slice  of 
ownership  to  investors,  also  investor  listens  to  other  factors 
that may be seen as risk to their investment before investing. 
In Nigeria for instance, the political tension of what 2023 will 
unfold may be some major setback as most potential investors 
might  want  to  hold  or  withdraw  their  investment.  The 
developed  Stock  Market  Prediction  System  considers  these 
major  factors  and  applies  technical  analysis  to  trading  stock. 
The  application  of  Fuzzy  Logic  to  this  work  produces  the 
mapping  between  these  factors  and  technical  indicators 
(MACD,  RSI,  SO,  and  WA)  as  inputs  which  are  then 
fuzzified,  creating  membership  functions  which  associates 
inputs and output through the fuzzy rules and also translating 
the  output  of  the  system  into  a  crisp  trading  which  is  a 
recommendation that aid buy/hold/sell decision to investors.
