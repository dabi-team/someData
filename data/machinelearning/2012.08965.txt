The Voronoi tessellation method in astronomy

Iryna Vavilova, Andrii Elyiv, Daria Dobrycheva, Olga Melnyk

Abstract The Voronoi tessellation is a natural way of space segmentation, which has
many applications in various ﬁelds of science and technology, as well as in social
sciences and visual art. The varieties of the Voronoi tessellation methods are com-
monly used in computational ﬂuid dynamics, computational geometry, geolocation
and logistics, game dev programming, cartography, engineering, liquid crystal elec-
tronic technology, machine learning, etc. The very innovative results were obtained
in astronomy, namely for a large-scale galaxy distribution and cosmic web pattern,
for revealing the quasi-periodicity in a pencil-beam survey, for a description of con-
straints on the isotropic cosmic microwave background and the explosion scenario
likely supernova events, for image processing, adaptive smoothing, segmentation,
for signal-to-noise ratio balancing, for spectrography data analysis as well as in the
moving-mesh cosmology simulation. We brieﬂy describe these results, paying more
attention to the practical application of the Voronoi tessellation related to the spatial
large-scale galaxy distribution.

1 The Voronoi tessellation in a spatial galaxy distribution: ﬁrst

works and basic approach

The geometrical methods based on the Voronoi diagram deal with a partitioning of
space into regions in a speciﬁc subset of generators. It was named after Georgy F.
Voronoi (April 28, 1868, Zhuravka village, Chernihiv region, Ukraine – Nov 20,
1908, Warsaw, Poland), the outstanding Ukrainian mathematician [90, 77], who
studied the general n-dimensional case of these diagrams [102, 103].

In 1984, Matsuda and Shima advanced the idea to apply the Voronoi tessellation
method for describing the cellular structure of the local Universe [63], ﬁnding
a topological tendency of galaxies “to cluster at the vertices, edges and faces of
polyhedral shaped voids”. In 1987, Ling demonstrated that the Voronoi tessellation
and the Minimal Spanning Tree being applied to the CfA Redshift Survey of galaxies
(the ﬁrst survey to map the large-scale structure of the Universe) are able to detach
ﬁlamentary structures and voids [60]. In 1989, Yoshioka & Ikeuchi proposed three-
dimensional Voronoi tessellation as a model of the evolution of the negative density
perturbations regions, which resulted in the overlapping of shells while the modeled
skeleton can be compared with real observed structures and with mass distribution
correlation functions [108].

For the ﬁrst time, the Voronoi tessellation was considered in detail as a pattern
of matter distribution in the Universe in work by Icke and Weygaert [48] and series
of their following works [49, 105, 50]. These authors concluded that the regions of
lower density become more spherical with evolution and matter ﬂoods away from
expansion centers and accrues at the borders of packing of spheres. This leads to
the partition of space on the Voronoi tessellation with nuclei in the centers of low-
density regions called the voids. High-density regions - clusters of galaxies - lie at
the crossing of vertexes of adjacent cells, ﬁlaments at the edge of cells, and pancakes
of large-scale structure (LSS) are faces of cells (Fig. 1, right). Sheth et al. [84] have
developed its idea and considered the model of a void created in the frame of the
Voronoi tessellation paradigm.

The Voronoi tessellation can be constructed as follows. Let us consider a Voronoi
cell of ﬁnite size in N-dimensional space (usually N = 2 or N = 3), where a ﬁxed
number of points is distributed according to some statistical law (for example, the
Poisson law). Suppose that each point is the center of a spherical expanding bubble
structure. If all these structures begin to expand at the same moment with the same
rate, the bubbles will be touched in planes that perpendicularly bisect the lines
connecting the centers of expansion. These bisecting planes, in turn, intersect each
other. As a result of this process, new lines will be generated, which in turn intersect
each other and form a network. Using an adopted terminology, we will call such a
center of the cell as a nucleus. So, each nucleus will be enclosed by a set of (N - 1) -
dimensional planes forming a convex cell. Distribution of nuclei forms the Voronoi
tessellation.

The realization of Voronoi tessellations for a certain number of expanding nuclei,
which is known as the Voronoi foam, can be found in [48, 105]. In the case of

The Voronoi tessellation method in astronomy

two-dimensional realization, the construction of a Voronoi cell consists of the search
for all the Delaunay triangles having three nuclei (the center of the circumscribing
circle is a vertex of the Voronoi foam). The program proposed by the authors [48],
allows one to ﬁnd all the Delaunay triangles having 𝑁1 as a corner and construct the
Voronoi cell belonging to 𝑁1 by joining the circumcentres of the Delaunay triangles.
Having applied this procedure to all nuclei, we obtain the Voronoi tessellation.

The process of forming the Voronoi tessellation is shown in Fig. 1(left). The points
𝑁0, 𝑁1, 𝑁2 form a Delaunay triangle obtained in a previous search; corresponding
Voronoi vertex V is shown within the (dashed) circumcircle of 𝑁0, 𝑁1, 𝑁2 as well
as stubs of the Voronoi cell walls. On the left hand side of the diagram, the T are
a sequence of trial points, the third of which produces a circle that encompasses
two nuclei, 𝑃1 and 𝑃2. The radius of the circumcircle of (𝑁1, 𝑁2, 𝑃1) being smaller
than that of (𝑁1, 𝑁2, 𝑃2), the point 𝑃2 is 𝑁3, i.e. the third corner of the Delaunay
triangle. Thus, the circumcenter of (𝑁1, 𝑁2, 𝑃1) is the next Voronoi vertex which, if
connected with V, produces a complete Voronoi cell wall ([48]).

Fig. 1: (Left) The construction of a new Delaunay triangle from two known nuclei
𝑁3 such that (𝑁1, 𝑁2, 𝑁3) forms a triangle whose circumsphere does not contain any
other nucleus in the Voronoi tessellation. (Right) Identiﬁcation of the four quantities
which were calculated in each Voronoi cell: 𝑙𝑖, the length of wall i; 𝛼, the angle
between two walls meeting at vertex; 𝑑 𝑤 , the distance between the nucleus and a
wall, where the projection of the nucleus doesn’t necessarily lie on the wall (Icke,
1987, open astronomy).

The obtained results could explain the heuristic models that supposing Voronoi
tessellations as 3D templates for the galaxy distribution as well as could reproduce a
variety of galaxy clustering properties. In an ideal scenario, the LSS is organized by
equal spherical voids expanding at the same rate. The walls and ﬁlaments would be
found precisely between expanding voids, and the resulting LSS web skeleton would
the Voronoi tessellation.

The Voronoi tessellation method was picked up and also thrived in our research
on a spatial galaxy distribution since 1990-is [93] that allowed us to obtain several
priority results. Namely, we elaborated three main approaches in Voronoi tessellation
application: (1) to describe a cosmic web skeleton in matter distribution as a Voronoi

4

tessellation with nuclei at low-density regions; (2) to use Voronoi tessellation as a tool
for direct measurement of galaxy local concentration and environmental description
of low-populated galaxy systems such as triplets, pairs, and isolated galaxies; 3) to
apply Voronoi diagrams altogether with machine learning methods for 3D mapping
of the Zone of Avoidance of our Galaxy [98, 100], where Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) algorithms are very useful [1, 36]. In particular, Coutinho et al. [19]
performed veriﬁcation of various algorithms that can reproduce the cellular structure
of the Universe. By comparing the simulated distributions with real observational
data, these authors showed that the best algorithm uses the nearest neighbour param-
eter between galaxies, and that network algorithms can be improved to reproduce
the large-scale structure of the Universe.

We give examples in Chapter 2, how manner our developed approach is working.
We brieﬂy overview in Chapter 3 various astronomical research with the Voronoi
diagrams, accentuating the papers related to the large-scale structure of the Universe,
as well as we highlight in Chapter 4 several works and software, where the Voronoi
tessellation and machine learning get along well with each other.

2 Voronoi tessellation of the ﬁrst, second and third orders:

identiﬁcation of the low-populated galaxy groups, environment
eﬀect, and dark matter content

Because of Voronoi tessellation is a geometrical method based only on galaxy
positions, it allows detaching overdensity regions of galaxies in comparison with
the background [94]. We tested it with various samples of galaxies. First of all, we
used the Local Supercluster of galaxies, which is well studied among other galaxy
superclusters, for identifying galaxy groups of various populations. It was revealed
that Voronoi’s tessellation method depends weakly on the richness-parameter of
groups, and the number of galaxies in the rich structures is growing rather than in
the weak structures with an increase of this parameter [64].

In the ﬁrst-order Voronoi tessellation, the critical parameter is the volume of
the galaxy’s Voronoi cell V. This parameter characterizes an environmental galaxy
density. The condition of cluster/group membership of a particular galaxy is the rel-
atively small V. This condition is actual when close neighbouring galaxies surround
the galaxy. That is why the ﬁrst order Voronoi tessellation is not corrected for the
identiﬁcation of small isolated galaxy systems [64].

We used the second-order Voronoi tessellation for the identiﬁcation of pairs
and single galaxies. Each galaxy 𝑖 from set 𝑆 forms the common cells with a certain
number of neighbouring galaxies (Fig. 2). So, under neighbouring galaxies of galaxy
𝑖, we understand only galaxies that create common cells with this galaxy. For example,
galaxy 1 creates only 4 common cells (𝑉1,2 , 𝑉1,3 , 𝑉1,4 , 𝑉1,5 ) with neighbouring
galaxies 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Each pair of galaxies 𝑖, 𝑗 is characterized by the
dimensionless parameters 𝑝𝑖, 𝑗 :

(1)

where 𝐷 – space dimension, 𝑉𝑖, 𝑗 – the area (for 2D) or volume (for 3D) of cell,
𝑚𝑖, 𝑗 – distance between galaxies 𝑖 and 𝑗. So, contrary to the ﬁrst-order tessellation,
the second-order tessellation for set S distribution of nuclei is the partition of the
space which associates a region 𝑉1,2 with each pair of nuclei 1 and 2 from 𝑆 in such
a way that all points in 𝑉1,2 are closer to 1 and 2 than other nuclei from S. Region
𝑉1,2 is a common cell for nuclei 1 and 2. However, these nuclei do not need to lie
in the common cell. For example, nuclei 1 and 5 create the common cell 𝑉1,5, and
they do not lie in this cell. In such a way, the second-order Voronoi tessellation is
available for the identiﬁcation of single galaxies and pairs (Fig. 2b).

Let us introduce the parameter 𝑝𝑒, which describe only pair environment and
does not depend on the distance between pair members directly. We deﬁne it as the
mean value of 𝑝 𝑗 (1) and 𝑝𝑙(2) parameters of the ﬁrst and second galaxy, excepting
𝑝 from both sets:

𝑝𝑒 =

𝑘
𝑗=2 𝑝 𝑗 (1) +

𝑛
𝑙=2 𝑝𝑙 (2)

,

(2)

Í

Í
𝑘 + 𝑛 − 2
where 𝑘 and 𝑛 – number of neighbouring galaxies for 1 and 2 galaxies of geometric
pair, respectively. We started sums from 𝑗 = 2 and 𝑙 = 2 for excepting 2𝑝, because the
ﬁrst galaxy is neighbour for the second galaxy and vice versa. Therefore 𝑘+𝑛−2 is sum
of neighbouring galaxies of pair members excepting of pair galaxies as neighbouring
for each other. Parameter 𝑝𝑒 depends on the distribution of neighbouring galaxies. A
small value of 𝑝𝑒 points out that such a pair is located in a loose environment. In such
case the average volume of common cells of pair components with neighbouring
galaxies is relatively small, and distance between them is signiﬁcant, see formula
(1) and Fig. 3a.

A single galaxy is a galaxy, which is not a member of any geometric pair. The
single galaxies are ﬁeld galaxies in the environment of geometric pairs. Every single
galaxy has the own neighbours; single galaxies and geometric pair members can be
among them. According to the second-order Voronoi tessellation, the larger is the
degree of galaxy isolation, the larger is the number of neighbours (see Fig. 2b in
comparison with Fig. 3b), but these neighbours locate farther. The best parameter
that describes the isolation degree of the single galaxy, 𝑠, is the mean value of all
parameters 𝑝 𝑗 of this galaxy:

Í

𝑠 =

𝑘
𝑗=1 𝑝 𝑗
𝑘
The third-order Voronoi tessellation is appropriate for the identiﬁcation of galaxy
triplets. It is the partition of the space which associates a region 𝑉1,2,3 with each
triplet of nuclei 1, 2, 3 in such a way that all points in 𝑉1,2,3 are closer to nuclei 1,
2, 3 than other nuclei from 𝑆 [59]. All points of the common triplet’s cell are closer
to galaxies of this triplet than to other galaxies. Similarly to the parameter 𝑝𝑖, 𝑗 for
pairs, we can set up the parameter 𝑡𝑖, 𝑗,𝑢 for triplets:

(3)

𝑡𝑖, 𝑗,𝑢 =

𝐷

𝑉𝑖, 𝑗,𝑢
𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑚𝑖, 𝑗 , 𝑚𝑖,𝑢, 𝑚 𝑗,𝑢),

p

(4)

where D is the space dimension, 𝑉𝑖, 𝑗,𝑢 is the area (for 2D) or volume (for 3D) of the
cell, and 𝑚𝑖, 𝑗 , 𝑚𝑖,𝑢, 𝑚 𝑗,𝑢 are the distances between galaxies in the triplet. A geometric
triplet in the third-order Voronoi tessellation contains three galaxies that have a
common cell and the same maximal parameters 𝑡𝑚𝑎 𝑥 (1) = 𝑡𝑚𝑎 𝑥 (2) = 𝑡𝑚𝑎 𝑥 (3) = 𝑡.
The parameter 𝑡 characterizes a degree of geometric triplet isolation. We can deﬁne
the parameter of triplet environment 𝑡𝑒 as the mean value of parameters 𝑡𝑖 (1), 𝑡 𝑗 (2),
and 𝑡𝑢 (3), except 𝑡 from three sets:

𝑡𝑒 =

Í

𝑘
𝑖=2 𝑡𝑖 (1) +

𝑛
𝑗=2 𝑡 𝑗 (2) +
Í
𝑘 + 𝑛 + 𝑞 − 3

𝑞
𝑢=2 𝑡𝑢 (3)

Í

(5)

here in the case of the third-order Voronoi tessellation, 𝑘, 𝑛, and 𝑞 denote the
number of neighbouring triplets which contain galaxies 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
Therefore, (𝑘 + 𝑛 + 𝑞 - 3) is the number of neighbouring triplets for a certain triplet
that contain at least one galaxy from this triplet (see, Fig. 3).

Parameters 𝑝, 𝑠, and 𝑡 are the basic ones and deﬁne the isolation degree of a galaxy
pair, single galaxy, or triplet compared to the background, respectively. Parameters
𝑝𝑒 and 𝑡𝑒 are additional ones and contain information about the distribution of the
neighbouring galaxies (environment). Similar to the second- and third-order Voronoi
tessellations, it is possible to apply more high-order Voronoi tessellations to identify
galaxy quartets and quintets, etc.

So, one can use galaxies as the nuclei of the Voronoi tessellation taking into
account equatorial coordinates 𝛼, 𝛿 and radial velocities of galaxies 𝑉ℎ only. For
the construction of the 3D Voronoi tessellations, it is necessary to determine the
distances in 3D space. The spatial distance between two galaxies can be decomposed

into projected (tangential) distance r and radial component v (diﬀerence of the radial
velocities). We can determine the projected distance with a relatively high accuracy.
Simultaneously, the radial component has errors due to the inaccuracy of radial
velocity measurement of each galaxy and existing strong peculiar velocities (due to
virial motions of galaxies in groups and clusters). As a result, the galaxy distribution
in the radial velocities space is extended along the radial component, the so-called
ﬁngers-of-God eﬀect. This is attributed to the random velocity dispersion in a galaxy
volume-limited sample that cause a galaxy’s velocity to deviate from pure Hubble
ﬂow, stretching out a group of galaxies in redshift space ([54, 66]). Various authors
take into account this eﬀect in their way, depending on the speciﬁcs of their problem.
For example, Marinoni et al. ([62]) chose some cylindrical window of clustering,
which is extended along the radial component. We introduced the weight for a
radial component ([34], avoiding the problem of tangential and radial distance in
equivalence to apply the high-order 3D Voronoi tessellation method.

An eﬃcient way to show Voronoi tessellation advantages was to apply it to the
galaxy samples from the Local Supercluster [95, 64, 97] and the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS), where at the ﬁrst time we examined it for spectroscopic aims
[65, 34, 96, 67, 70, 78]. We did not consider galaxies that located within 2𝑜 near
borders, because the correct estimation of Voronoi cell volume is not possible in this
case. Selecting single galaxies and pairs by the second-order Voronoi tessellation,
as well as triplets by the third-order Voronoi tessellation method, we obtained 2196
geometric pairs, 1182 triplets and 2394 single galaxies. We did not make a clear
division between physical gravitationally bound systems and non-physical ones,
following the supposition that the more isolated a system is, the higher probability
that it is physical (compact pairs are with 𝑅ℎ < 150 kpc and triplets are with 𝑅ℎ <
200 kpc).

Estimating the dark matter content in the low-populated groups, we obtained the
median values of mass-to-luminosity ratio ([34]): 12𝑀𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 /𝐿𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 for the isolated
pairs and 44𝑀𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 /𝐿𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 for the isolated triplets. Note that for the most com-

astronomy).

pact pairs and triplets (with R < 50 (100) kpc, respectively) there is not a very
large diﬀerence in dark matter content for pairs and triplets: 7 𝑀𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 /𝐿𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 and
8 𝑀𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 /𝐿𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 . The mass-to-luminosity ratio diagram for galaxy systems of dif-
ferent population (star clusters, galaxies, galaxy groups, including the low-populated
ones, clusters, and superclusters) is presented in Fig. 4. Several examples of isolated
triplets of galaxies are given in Fig. 5. We conclude about the dark matter distri-
bution that for the dynamically younger sparsely groups (triplets), dark matter is
more likely associated with the individual galaxy halos, for the interacting and late
sparsely groups the dark matter lies in a common halo of galaxy groups.

Using an inverse volume of Voronoi cell (1/𝑉) as a parameter describing the local
environmental density of a galaxy, we considered the volume-limited SDSS (DR5
and DR9) galaxy samples (0.02 < 𝑧 < 0.1, −24 < 𝑀𝑟 < −19.4) [67, 26, 27, 30] and
found that

evident that the Holmberg eﬀect is not revealing, by the other words, it can be
considered only in historical aspect [28];

• properties of such small groups as pairs and triplets, where segregation by lumi-
nosity was clearly observed, are ﬁt well to Dressler eﬀect: galaxies in isolated
pairs and triplets are on average two times more luminous than isolated galaxies;
the dependence of the color indices and stellar magnitudes is eﬀective for the
automated morphological classiﬁcation of the galaxies (𝐸 – early types, 𝐿 – late
types).

•

The morphological types of the galaxies were divided into two classes: Early - 𝐸
(from elliptical and lenticular) and Late - 𝐿 (from 𝑆𝑎 to 𝐼𝑟𝑟). The absolute magnitude

𝑀𝑟 = 𝑚𝑟 − 5𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑉/𝐻0) − 25 − 𝐾 (𝑧) − 𝑒𝑥𝑡

(6)

could be corrected for Galactic absorption 𝑒𝑥𝑡 in accordance with [82] and 𝐾 -
correction 𝐾 (𝑧) according to [16]. Here we used the CDM model of the Universe
with the WMPS7 cosmological parameters (Ω𝑀 = 0.27, ΩΛ = 0.73, Ω𝑘 = 0, 𝐻0 =
0.71). In order to apply the Voronoi tessellation method we should done transition
from equatorial coordinates and velocities to the comoving 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧 coordinates for
each central galaxy in the sample (𝑀𝑟 < -20.7). To do this we can transform the
redshift 𝑧 to the corresponding distance 𝜒(𝑧) for each galaxy by integrating as follows

The coordinates 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧 of the galaxies in the comoving space are determined as

follows

𝑥 = 𝜒(𝑧)𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜃)𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜙)

(9)

where (𝜃) is the declination of each galaxy, (𝜙) is the right ascension, and (𝜒(𝑧))
is the corresponding distance for redshift 𝑧. After getting the three-dimensional
Cartesian coordinates of the galaxies, we divided the geometrical space occupied
by the galaxy sample in mosaic cells (volumes 𝑉 in the 3D case). Each cell has a
galaxy as a nucleus and consists of elementary volumes of space closer to this galaxy
than to any other galaxy [63]. The use of the Voronoi tessellation to isolate groups
of galaxies in three dimensions has been described in detail by Melnyk et al. [64].
Fig. 2a shows an example of the Voronoi tessellation in a two dimensional case to
make it easier to see. Let us use the value of inverse volume (1/𝑉) of the Voronoi
cells to describe the density of galaxy environments; when 1/𝑉 is higher, a galaxy
is less isolated.

Examples of the distributions of 𝐸 and 𝐿 galaxies vs. inverse volume of the
Voronoi cells that contain them are shown in Fig. 6. In work [27] we grouped
galaxies from the SDDSS sample at z < 0.1 into 4 logarithmic intervals 1/𝑉 < 0.001,
0.001 < 1/𝑉 < 0.01, 0.01 < 1/𝑉 < 0.1, and 1/𝑉 > 0.1 for four ranges of the redshift
0.02 < 𝑧 < 0.04, 0.04 < 𝑧 < 0.06, 0.06 < 𝑧 < 0.08, and 0.08 < 𝑧 < 0.1 (in the
rows) and for diﬀerent ranges of absolute stellar magnitude, −21.5 < 𝑀𝑟 < −20.7,
−22.5 < 𝑀𝑟 < −21.5, and 𝑀𝑟 < −22.5. The number of galaxies in each bin for
the 𝐸 and 𝐿 types is normalized to the total number of 𝐸 ÷ 𝐿 galaxies within the
given subsample. Fig. 6 shows that the fraction of galaxies of spiral and late types
becomes larger while redshift increasing, while the fraction of early types, on the
contrary, is smaller. That follows the well known evolutionary trend of a reduction
in the number of galaxies with suppression of star formation for increasing redshift
[21, 91], even at comparatively low redshifts down to 𝑧 < 0.1. Also, for the brighter
galaxies in the sample, the fraction of galaxies of earlier types is larger since, on the
average, earlier types have higher luminosities (the well-known morphological type
vs. colour indices/luminosity relation) [8, 73, 44]. The brightest galaxies of earlier
types with 𝑀𝑟 < −22.5 appear preferentially in denser environments: the peak of the
distribution of the inverse volumes of the Voronoi cells for the 𝐸 types lie within the
interval 0.01 < 1/𝑉 < 0.1, while in other intervals of 𝑀𝑟 , for the 𝐿 types the peak
of the distribution always is within 0.001 < 1/𝑉 < 0.01 (the morphology-density
relation [32, 8, 44, 28]).

Fig. 6: The distribution of the number of galaxies vs inverse volume of the Voronoi
cell (local density parameter), with early morphological type 𝐸 indicated by red lines
and late type 𝐿 indicated by blue lines, for diﬀerent ranges of redshift; absolute stellar
magnitude of galaxies selected from the SDSS at z < 0.1 is −22.5 < 𝑀𝑟 < −21.5.
The number of galaxies in each bin is normalized to the total number of 𝐸 ÷ 𝐿 within
the given subsample. The number of central bright 𝐸 and 𝐿 galaxies is as follows:
𝐸 = 1636, 𝐿 = 459 for 0.02 < 𝑧 < 0.04, 𝐸 = 3609, 𝐿 = 1247 for 0.04 < 𝑧 < 0.06, 𝐸
= 9432, 𝐿 = 3596 for 0.06 < 𝑧 < 0.08 (Dobrycheva, 2015).

We can also determine the density of galaxies in a Voronoi cell, including their
faint satellites, i.e., galaxies with 𝑀𝑟 𝑟 > −20.7: (𝑛 + 1)/𝑉, where n is the number
of faint galaxies in the Voronoi cell, and 𝑉 is the volume of the Voronoi cell. We
also constructed distributions of early 𝐸 and 𝐿 types galaxies in dependence on the
parameter (𝑛 + 1)/𝑉 in four intervals: (𝑛 + 1)/𝑉 < 0.01, 0.01 < (𝑛 + 1)/𝑉 < 0.1,
0.1 < (𝑛 + 1)/𝑉 < 1, and (𝑛 + 1)/𝑉 > 1. The number of galaxies is normalized to
the number of 𝐸 ÷ 𝐿 galaxies within the given range of (𝑛 + 1)/𝑉. We examined the
density of galaxies only in the ﬁrst two redshift intervals, since we cannot evaluate the
evolution of their properties at a higher 𝑧 because there are not enough faint galaxies.
However, we can compare the galaxies’ environmental density as a function of the
absolute magnitude and morphological type of the bright central galaxy. Thus, the
fraction of early types of central galaxies increases with increasing environmental
density, while, on the other hand, the fraction of late types decreases; that is, the
earlier types are in a denser environment than the late types. When the central galaxy
is brighter, the fraction of early types in a subsample will be larger [27, 101].

3 The Voronoi tessellation in astrophysical research

Ebeling and Wiedenmann [33] were the ﬁrst to apply the Voronoi tessellation for
ﬁnding galaxy groups and clusters. Later such an approach was used by Ramella
et al. [79], Kim et al. [56], Lopes et al. [61], Barrena et al. [6], Melnyk et al. [65],
Panko and Flin [71]. Doroshkevich [31] introduced its for ﬁlaments and walls (1D
and 2D LSS structures) as well as Neyrinck [68] for the search of voids in a spatial
galaxy distribution.

We note some important earlier works as concerns with other applications of
Voronoi diagrams to the large-scale galaxy distribution: for revealing the quasi-
periodicities in a pencil-beam survey [88, 51], for a description of constraints on the
Voronoi model when applied to the isotropic cosmic microwave background [17]. A
signiﬁcant contribution for Voronoi tessellation application to various astronomical
tasks was made by Zanninetti, who considered two- and three-dimensional cases of
the explosion scenario likely supernova events and developed a dynamical method
allowing to describe the explosion phases [109, 110].

Ramella et al. [79] created a Voronoi Galaxy Cluster Finder, which uses posi-
tions and magnitudes of galaxies to deﬁne galaxy clusters and extract its parameters:
size, richness, central density, etc. The 3D Voronoi tessellation for galaxy group
identiﬁcation was realized by Marinoni et al. [62] and Cooper et al. [18]. Wey-
gaert et al. prepared a useful review of the spatial galaxy distribution and Delaunay
and Voronoi tessellations [106, 42]. They discussed the Delaunay Tessellation Field
Estimator (DTFE) and the concept of Alphashapes for matter distribution; the Multi-
scale Morphology Filter (MMF), which uses the DTFE for detachment of ﬁlaments,
sheets, and clusters; the Watershed Voidﬁnder (WVF) to identify voids.

The era of big data surveys (see, for example, review in work by Vavilova et al.
[99] accelerated the Voronoi diagrams application on a spatial galaxy distribution
properties and environment inﬂuence: 𝑧 = 0.1 − 3.0, COSMOS survey [83]; z ≤
0.5, Herschel-ATLAS/GAMA [9]; z < 0.1, Coma Supercluster [20]; z < 0.3, AL-
HAMBRA survey [80]. Söchting et al. used Voronoi tessellation within overlapping
slices in the photometric redshift space (0.2<z<3.0). It allowed them to detach region
𝑧 ∼ 0.4 with a slow emergence of virialized clusters accordingly to the hierarchical
scenario and to detect new superclusters as the peaks of a matter distribution up to z
= 2.9 [86]. As for the Voronoi tessellation cluster ﬁnder algorithms, we note the work
by Soares et al., who developed it to produce reliable cluster catalogs up to 𝑧 = 1 or
beyond and down to 1013.5 solar masses. They built the Voronoi tessellation cluster
ﬁnder in photometric redshift shells and used the two-point correlation function of
the galaxies in the ﬁeld to determine the density threshold for the detection of cluster
candidates and to establish their signiﬁcance [85].

A principal new galaxy cluster ﬁnder based on a 3D Voronoi Tessellation plus
a maximum likelihood estimator, followed by gapping-ﬁltering in radial velocity
(𝑉 𝑜𝑀 𝐿 + 𝐺), was developed by Pereira et al. [75, 76]. They applied it successfully
to ﬁnd optical clusters (𝑅200) in the Local Universe as well as Santiago-Batista et
al. for the identiﬁcation of continuous ﬁlaments in the environment of superclusters
[81]. Grokhovskaya et al. developed ﬁltering algorithms of multiparameter analysis
of the large scale distribution of galaxies (identiﬁcation of galaxy systems and voids)
in narrow slices in the entire range of redshifts of HS 47.5-22 constructing density
contrast maps, namely with adaptive kernel and Voronoi tessellation [40]. The 3D
Voronoi tessellation application to the DEEP2 survey was ﬁrst introduced by Gerke
et al. [38]. Meanwhile, Shen Ying et al. [107] proposed an algorithm which computes
the cluster of 3D points by applying a set of 3D Voronoi cells and allows a 3D point
cluster pattern can be highlighted and easily recognized.

The Voronoi tessellation method in astronomy

Hung et al. have demonstrated that Voronoi tessellation Monte-Carlo mapping is
beneﬁcial for studying the environment eﬀect on galaxy evolution in high-redshift
large-scale structures (z∼1) in the ORELSE survey (Observations of Redshift Evo-
lution in Large Scale Environments) [47]. An exciting application of Voronoi tes-
sellation was proposed by Lam et al. [57]: for constructing the white dwarfs lu-
minosity functions they used parameters of proper motion and colours from the
Pan-STARRS 1 3𝜋 Steradian Survey Processing Version 2; for improving the accu-
racy of the maximum volume method they used Voronoi tessellation space binning to
recalculate photometric/astrometric uncertainties. It helped to estimate disk-to=halo
dark matter ratio as 100. Another a non-parametric method for estimating halo con-
centration using Voronoi tessellation, TesseRACT, was proposed by Lang et al. [58],
who showed that it ﬁt well with non-spherical halos and more accurate at recovering
intermediate concentrations for N-body halos than techniques that assume spherical
symmetry.

The very interesting algorithm, Void Finder ZOBOV (ZOnes Bordering On Void-
ness), based on Voronoi tessellation, was proposed by Neyrinck et al. [68]. This
algorithm ﬁnds density depressions galaxy distribution without free parameters. To
estimate local density, it uses the Voronoi tessellation. One of the output of this al-
gorithm is the probability that each void arises from Poisson ﬂuctuations. However,
Elyiv et al. [35] have demonstrated a weak spot for ZOBOV void ﬁnder. Voids are
the lowest density regions, so any method that uses the positions of galaxies directly
to measure density for identifying the voids is then prone to shot noise error since
voids are the regions with a very low concentration of galaxies by deﬁnition (Fig.
7). The Void IDentiﬁcation and Examination toolkit (VIDE) developed by Sutter et
al. [89] includes the parameter-free void ﬁnder ZOBOV, where “Voronoi tessellation
of the tracer particles is used to estimate the density ﬁeld followed by a watershed
algorithm to group Voronoi cells into zones and subsequently voids”.

Zaninetti in series of works [111, 113] developed a practical statistics for the voids
between galaxies with two new survival functions and considered the 3D distribution
of the volumes of Poissonian Voronoi Diagrams to their 2D cross-sections in the
assumption of gamma-function for the 3D statistics of the volumes of the voids in the
Local Universe. He also conducted simulations [112] of a spatial galaxy distribution
using the Poissonian Voronoi polyhedra and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey and
the Third Reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies; Zaninetti gives a brief overview of
a current status of the research on the statistics of the Voronoi Diagrams in [114].

Among other astronomical tasks, the Voronoi diagrams have been used for image
processing, adaptive smoothing, segmentation, for signal-to-noise ratio balancing
[14], for spatial structure of the solar wind and solar-terrestrial connections [7],
for spectrography data analysis in diﬀerent electromagnetic regions [12, 13, 25],
in the moving-mesh cosmology simulation [87] and [104] (AREPO Public Code),
chemical evolution in the early universe [15], star formation simulation [46], spatial
distribution of lunar craters [45]. For example, Cabrera et al.
[11] applied the
Voronoi diagram for image reconstruction technique in the interferometric data
based on the Bayesian approach. Cadha et al. proposed Voronoi compact image
descriptors and showed that Voronoi partitioning improves the geometric invariance

panels) and the Lagrangian Zel’dovich Void Finder (right-hand panels).

and performance of image retrieval [14] as well as they developed a Voronoi-based
machine learning method (deep convolution neural network). As for the cosmological
simulation, Busch and White [10] used Voronoi tessellation for a hierarchical tree
structure that allowed them to associate local density peaks with disjoint subsets of
particles and to analyze mass distribution at diﬀerent levels of threshold. Similar
to our work [27], when we introduced parameter of the volume of Voronoi cell
to study environment inﬂuence on galaxies from the SDSS, Paranjape & Alam
[72] applied inverse local number density parameter to study physical eﬀects for
such properties as halo (subhalo) mass, large-scale environment, etc. in various
cosmological dark matter models and concluded that the Voronoi volume function
gives a new mathematical instrument for galaxy evolution physics and dark sector
study.

Neyrinck developed the sectional-Voronoi algorithms in Python for cosmic-web
research, because the Voronoi/Delaunay duals and origami tessellation give a wide
class of spiderwebs. “Voronoi edges are perpendicular bisectors of their correspond-
ing Delaunay edges; the ‘bisector’ part can be relaxed. Each Voronoi edge may
be slid along its Delaunay edge, closer to one of the generators. They may not

The Voronoi tessellation method in astronomy

15

be slid entirely independently, though, since the Voronoi edges must still join ver-
tices. There turns out to be one extra degree of freedom per generator, causing
its cell to expand or contract. The result is a sectional-Voronoi diagram, a section
through a higher-dimensional Voronoi tessellation. A generator’s extra degree of
freedom in a sectional-Voronoi diagram can be thought of as its distance from the
space being tessellated. A sectional-Voronoi diagram can also be thought of as a
Voronoi tessellation in which each generator may have a diﬀerent additive ‘power’
in the distance function used to determine which points are closest to the gener-
ator (thus an alternative term, power diagram). Ash and Bolker [2] showed that
2D spiderwebs and sectional Voronoi tessellations are equivalent” (cited by [69].
The package is available at https://github.com/neyrinck/sectional-tess,
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neyrinck/sectional-tess/master.

In the present day, the Voronoi diagrams methods have many applications in
various ﬁelds of science and technology, as well as in social sciences and visual
art
[3, 4]. They are commonly used in computational ﬂuid dynamics, compu-
tational geometry, geolocation and logistics, game dev programming, cartogra-
phy, engineering, liquid crystal electronic technology, etc. For the ﬁrst time, the
Voronoi tessellation was utilized by Debnath et al. [22] for the discoveries in
the particle physics beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider at
CERN. “Since such tessellations capture the underlying probability distributions
of the phase space, interesting features in the data can be detected by studying
the geometrical aspects of the ensemble of Voronoi cells (cited by [23]). These
methods allow identifying kinematic edges in two dimensions and generalize the
technique for robust detection of phase space boundaries, which could be applied
to discover new physics. An interesting library of ”Voronoi Diagrams: Applica-
tions from Archaeology to Zoology" is collected by Scot Drysdale on the website
https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/gina/scot.drysdale.html.

4 The Voronoi tessellation and Machine learning

Straight application of classical Voronoi diagram in Machine Learning is the k-
nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm at the number of neighbors 𝑘 = 1. In the case of
the classiﬁer, the output class is choosing among its k the closest neighbors. Each of
them gives a contribution to the class with some weight. Normally weight is inverse
to the distance between target object and neighbor (closer neighbors will have a
stronger inﬂuence than further neighbors) or uniform (all points in neighborhood are
weighted equally). If 𝑘 = 1, then the object is just linked to the class of the nearest
neighbor. From the other side, it could be interpreted as the building of the Voronoi
diagram by training objects as nuclei of the diagram. The target object will have a
class depending on which Voronoi cell it resides. Bring your data to life.

A set of programming codes for 1-NN visualization (𝑘 = 1) with examples (Hover
Voronoi, a demonstration of d3-Delaunay, Voronoi Labels, Voronoi neighbors,
Voronoi update) are available on the website https://observablehq.com/@d3/

16

by Mike Bostock (2018). For the color image segmentation problem in computer
vision, an adaptive and unsupervised clustering approach with Voronoi diagrams
was introduced, which outperforms the existing algorithms [43]. A Python library
”Pycobra" contains several ensemble machine learning algorithms and visualization
tools based on the Voronoi tessellations [41]. It can be downloaded from the Python
Package Index (PyPi) and Machine Learning Open Source Software (MLOSS) at
https://github.com/bhargavvader/pycobra.

In the case of 𝑘 > 1, we should use the concept of high order Voronoi diagram,
where a cell represents the set of points in space closer to a given 𝑘 nuclei that to
all others (see, Chapter 2 and works by Elyiv et al. [34], [100]). In this case, k–order
Voronoi space dividing can help us to ﬁnd k-near neighbors directly. The crossing of
high-order Voronoi diagram borders represent changing the set of k near neighbors.
In k–NN regression, the output value for the target object is the average of the values
of k nearest neighbors. If each neighbor has equal weight, it means that for each cell
could be assigned pre-calculated averaged value. Next, if the target object resides in
this cell, automatic assigned could be done. In all these cases, creating a Voronoi
diagram on the training sample could make a faster k–NN algorithm application.

For example, Inkulu and Kapoor [53] presented an algorithm covering the Voronoi
diagram with hyperboxes, which provides ANN queries. Another parallel spatial
range query algorithm based on Voronoi diagrams and MR-tree, which is beneﬁting
from the k-NN, is developed by Fu and Liu [37].

Voronoi diagram also has a wide application in deep learning. In work [5], the au-
thors studied the geometry of Deep Artiﬁcial Neural Networks with piecewise aﬃne
and convex nonlinearities. The authors demonstrated that each layer’s input space
partition corresponds to the Voronoi diagram with several regions that grow exponen-
tially with increasing neurons. Numerical experiments for classiﬁcation problems
support their main theoretical results are expressed by the Deep ANN decision
boundary in the input space, a measure of its curvature that depends on the network
architecture, activation functions, and weights. In work [52] the authors presented a
Deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) constructed on a Voronoi tessellation of
3D molecular structures of proteins (VoroCNN model). Both convolution and pool-
ing operations were used as a part of network architecture to predict local qualities
of 3D protein folds. They computed Voronoi tessellation of molecular 3D structures
and converted them into a protein interaction graph. The graph’s critical property
is that it implicitly keeps the information about the spatial relationship between the
atoms of the protein model. The authors claim that for presently available amounts
of data and computational resources, Voronoi tessellation is the best representation
of 3D protein structure than raw volumetric data.

5 Instead of Conclusion

Today, hierarchical clustering is a common scenario for the evolution of galaxies.
The fact that galaxies are observed mostly at redshifts to 𝑧 ∼ 5, while the most distant

The Voronoi tessellation method in astronomy

observed galaxy clusters are at 𝑧 ∼ 2, suggests that galaxies and sparsely populated
groups were formed ﬁrst, and galaxy clusters later by subcluster merging and/or via
capturing galaxies and galaxy groups. The hierarchical clustering scenario is in good
agreement with the cosmological ΛCDM model. Having great success in explaining
the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe as a whole, this model
faces potentially severe problems on the scales of individual dark halo of galaxies
and galaxy clusters, with statistics of the distribution of galaxies with diﬀerent
morphological types in a wide range of redshifts, with evolutionary properties of
sparsely populated groups and galaxy clusters, with the lack of data on the large-scale
structure of the Universe behind the Zone of Avoidance of the Galaxy.

In this context, we have demonstrated the perfection and elegance of the Voronoi
tessellation in solving many astronomical problems, focusing on its eﬀectiveness for
describing the web of large-scale structures of the Universe and data mining of its
properties at various redshifts from early epochs to the scales of the Local Universe.

renhammer, 2000, open access). (Right) Illustration of the Voronoi tessellation for
galaxy web distribution.

“God ﬁrst partitioned the plenum into equal-sized portions, and then placed these
bodies into various circular motions that, ultimately, formed the three elements of
matter and the vortex systems” (cited by R. Descartes, 1644 year [24], vol.III, article
46, in [4]). ”The modern view shoves baryogenesis, leptogenesis, WIMP– genesis,
and all very far back in time, but builds up structure continuously, using not-very-
special initial conditions and gravity (plus perhaps other forces) to develop what we
see today. In between come some remarkable constructs, including Thomas Wright’s

hierarchy, Descartes’s Voronoi tessellation of whirlpools in the ether, Alfred Russel
Wallace’s (yes, the evolution guy) ”Goldilocks” location for the Solar system, Cor-
nelis Easton’s oﬀ-center spiral arms, and the Kapteyn Universe" (cited by V. Trimble,
2014 year [92]). We have combined this representation, which is consonant with ours,
in Fig. 8 as an illustration of partitioning the space into cells for the subsequent ex-
traction of the physical essence of the phenomena: one of them displays classical
physics, Vortex theory applied to the Solar system (Descartes, 1644), the other gives
a visualization of galaxy distribution through the 2D- Voronoi tessellation.
