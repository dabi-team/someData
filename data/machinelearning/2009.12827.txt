Generative adversarial networks are an emerging technique with wide applications in
machine learning [1], which have achieved dramatic success in a number of challenging
tasks including image and video generation [2]. When equipped with quantum pro-
cessors, their quantum counterparts—called quantum generative adversarial networks
(QGANs)—may even exhibit exponential advantages in certain machine learning ap-
plications [3–9]. Here, we report an experimental implementation of a QGAN using
a programmable superconducting processor, in which both the generator and the dis-
criminator are parameterized via layers of single- and multi-qubit quantum gates. The
programmed QGAN runs automatically several rounds of adversarial learning with
quantum gradients to achieve a Nash equilibrium point, where the generator can repli-
cate data samples that mimic the ones from the training set. Our implementation
is promising to scale up to noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, thus paving the
way for experimental explorations of quantum advantages in practical applications with
near-term quantum technologies.

The interplay between quantum physics and machine
learning gives rise to an emergent research frontier of
quantum machine learning that has attracted tremen-
dous attention recently [10–13].
In particular, cer-
tain carefully-designed quantum algorithms for machine
learning, or more broadly artiﬁcial intelligence, may ex-
hibit exponential advantages compared to their best pos-
sible classical counterparts [3, 11–16]. An intriguing ex-
ample concerns quantum generative adversarial networks
(QGANs) [3], where near-term quantum devices have the
potential to showcase quantum supremacy [17] with real-
life practical applications.

The general framework of QGANs consists of a gen-
erator learning to generate statistics for data mimick-
ing those of a true data set, and a discriminator trying
to discriminate generated data from true data [3]. The
generator and discriminator follow an adversarial learn-
ing procedure to optimize their strategies alternatively
and arrive at a Nash equilibrium point, where the gen-
erator learns the underlying statistics of the true data
and the discriminator can no longer distinguish the dif-
ference between the true and generated data. Diﬀerent
versions of QGANs have been proposed [3–9]. Recently,
a proof-of-principle experimental QGAN demonstration
has been reported [7], showing that the generator can

indeed be trained via the adversarial learning process
to replicate the statistics of the single-qubit quantum
data output from a quantum channel simulator. Yet, in
this experiment the gradient, which is crucial for train-
ing the QGAN, was estimated numerically by the ﬁnite-
diﬀerence method with a classical computer. This ﬁnite-
diﬀerence approach induces an inaccuracy to the gradient
and therefore may signiﬁcantly retard the convergence
to the equilibrium point [15].
In addition, the quan-
tum states involved in this experiment were all single-
qubit states, and entanglement, a characterizing feature
of quantumness and a vital resource for quantum advan-
tages, was absent during the learning process [12].

In this paper, we add these two crucial yet miss-
ing blocks by reporting an experiment realization of a
QGAN based on a programmable superconducting pro-
cessor with multiple qubits. Superconducting qubits are
a promising platform for realizing QGANs, owing to their
ﬂexible design, excellent scalability and remarkable con-
trollability. In our implementation, both the generator
and discriminator are composed of multiqubit parameter-
ized quantum circuits, also referred to as quantum neu-
ral networks in some contexts [18–21]. Here, we bench-
mark the functionality of the quantum gradient method
by learning an arbitrary mixed state, where the state is

 
 
 
 
 
 
replicated with a ﬁdelity up to 0.999. We further uti-
lize our QGAN to learn an classical XOR gate, and the
generator is successfully trained to exhibit a truth table
close to that of the XOR gate.

We ﬁrst introduce a general recipe for our QGAN and
then apply it to two typical scenarios: learning quantum
states and the classical XOR gate. The overall structure
of the QGAN is outlined in Fig. 1 (a), which includes
an input label, a real source (R), a generator (G), a dis-
criminator (D), and a quantum gradient subroutine. The
input label sorts the training data stored in R, and also
instructs G to generate data samples mimicking R. D re-
ceives the label and corresponding data samples from ei-
ther G or R, and then evaluates with appropriate scores,
based on which a loss function V is constructed to dif-
ferentiate between R and G. The adversarial training
procedure is repeated in conjugation with the quantum
gradient subroutine, which yields the partial derivatives
of V with respect to the parameters constructing D or
G, so as to maximize V for the optimal conﬁguration of
D and to minimize V for the optimal G in terms of the
chosen values of the constructing parameters.

Speciﬁcally, denoting the sets of parameters construct-
ing G and D as (cid:126)θG and (cid:126)θD, respectively, the loss function
V is written as

V =

where N is the total number of data samples selected
for training and SD,R
) represents the score of the
nth data sample from R (G) evaluated by D. G and
D are trained alternately with D being trained ﬁrst. In
D’s turn, we maximize the loss function by iteratively
optimizing (cid:126)θD according to (cid:126)θi+1
V , where i
D +αD∇(cid:126)θD
is the iteration step index and ∇(cid:126)θD
V denotes the gradient
vector of the loss function at the ith step; we train G
by minimizing the square of the loss function with an
iteration relation (cid:126)θi+1
V 2. The learning
rates can be adjusted by tuning αD and αG which are
typically on the order of unity.

G − αG∇(cid:126)θG

G = (cid:126)θi

D = (cid:126)θi

An important quantity that plays a vital role in train-
ing our QGAN is the gradient of the loss function with
respect to a given parameter. Interestingly, owing to the
special structures of our quantum circuits for the genera-
tor and the discriminator, a common approach to obtain
such a gradient is to shift the corresponding parameter
by ±π/2 and measure the loss function at the shifted val-
ues [22]. In our experiment, we employ a even simpler
method—the Hadamard test quantum algorithm [23]—
to obtain the gradient. This algorithm can reduce half
of the time in comparison with the common approach
to ﬁnish the training, at the expense of an additional
auxiliary qubit and two controlled gates (see next) [24].
At each round of the training process, the parameters of
the discriminator (or generator) are updated simultane-
ously after the gradients for all parameters are obtained,

2

and a quantum process tomography (QPT) is performed
to characterize the overlap ﬁdelity between the generated
data based on the updated parameters and the true data.
The above mentioned QGAN is experimentally re-
alized on a superconducting quantum processor using
5 frequency-tunable transmon qubits labeled as Qj for
j = 0 to 4, where all qubits are interconnected by a cen-
tral bus resonator as illustrated in Fig. 1 (b). The role
arrangement of Q0 to Q4 can be visualized by the exem-
plary experimental sequence shown in Fig 1 (c). Q0 is
to assist the quantum gradient subroutine. Q1-Q2 stores
the label which is passed to D, with the output score
encoded in Q1 by SD,R/G
1(cid:105)/2 + 1/2. For the ex-
perimental instances with G inserted, Q3-Q4 also stores
the label as the input to G and the output data sample
from G is passed to D via Q3; for the experimental in-
stances with R in replacement of G, only Q3 stores the
data sample from R as designated by the label. Details
of the device parameters can be found in supplementary
materials (SM) [24] and Ref. [25].

By tuning the qubits on resonance but detuned from
the bus resonator in frequency, these qubits can be all
eﬀectively connected, which enables the ﬂexible realiza-
tions of the multiqubit entangling gates among arbitrar-
ily selected qubits. The all-to-all interactions are de-
scribed in the dispersive regime by the eﬀective Hamil-
tonian HI = (cid:80) λjk(σ+
j (σ−

j )
denotes the raising (lowering) operator of Qj, and λjk is
the eﬀective coupling strength between Qj and Qk medi-
ated by the bus resonator. Evolution under this Hamil-
tonian for an interaction time τ leads to the entangling
operator with the form of UENT = e−iHIτ , which can
steer the interacting qubits into highly entangled state.
In our QGAN, the parameterized quantum circuits that
comprise G and D leverage the naturally available multi-
qubit UENTs, with the interaction time of the two-qubit
UENT ﬁxed at around 50 ns for G and the three-qubit
one ﬁxed at around 55 ns for D [24]. We note that, in
this hardware-eﬃcient realization of the QGAN, the en-
tangling operators can be any device-tailored operations
that generate suﬃcient entanglement.

j,l,m and θz

As laid out in Fig. 1 (c), the entangling operators UENT
are interleaved with the single-qubit X and Z rotations,
which successively rotate Qj around x- and z-axis in the
Bloch sphere by angles of θx
j,l,m, where l is
the layer index and m ∈ {G, D}. The lengths of the X
and Z rotations are ﬁxed at 30 and 20 ns, respectively.
Taking into account the experimental imperfections, we
perform numerical simulations to decide the depths of the
interleaved layers consisting of UENT and the single-qubit
rotations, for a balance between the learning ﬁdelity and
eﬃciency. For example, to learn the XOR gate, the cir-
cuit layer depths are set to be 2 and 3 for G and D
respectively, as shown in Fig.1 (c).

The QGAN learning process is guided by the gradient
of the loss function with respect to (cid:126)θG and (cid:126)θD. To ob-

tain these gradients, we adopt a quantum method called
Hadamard test [4, 23], which is illustrated in the sequence
instance in Fig. 1 (c). For the partial derivative with re-
spect to the parameter θx
j,l,m (θz
j,l,m), we insert the ﬁrst
controlled-X (Z) gate right after the single-qubit X (Z)
rotation containing this parameter, with Qj as the tar-
get. The second controlled-Z gate is applied at the end
of the training sequence with Q1 as the target. The par-
tial derivative of Q1’s (cid:104)σz
1(cid:105), which relates to D’s output
1(cid:105)/∂θx(z)
score, is given by ∂(cid:104)σz
0(cid:105), which can be
directly obtained by measuring Q0 and used in comput-
ing the gradient of the loss function. See SM [24] for
more details about the experimental realizations of the
controlled-X (Z) gates, as well as the theoretical and ex-
perimental veriﬁcations of the quantum gradient method.

j,l,m = −(cid:104)σz

To benchmark the functionality of the quantum gra-
dient method and the learning eﬃciency of our QGAN
circuit, we ﬁrst train an arbitrary mixed state as data

0.7396
0.0431−0.3501i

which is a simulation of quantum channel. As shown
in the inset of Fig.2 (a), the mixed state for Q3 reads
(cid:1), which is generated by
ρR = (cid:0)
applying two single-qubit X rotations (with the rotation
angles of 1.35 on Q3 and 0.68 on Q4) followed by the
UENT gate on Q3 and Q4. Correspondingly, G is set
up with a single layer and 2 parameters describing the
single-qubit X rotation angles during the training, while
D remains the one shown in Fig.1 (c) with 3 layers and
all 18 parameters being trained. The trajectories of the
loss function and scores of data from R/G during the
training process are recorded and plotted in Fig. 2 (a).
We optimize D at the beginning of the training to en-
large the distance between SD,R and SD,G. At the end
of this turn, D can discriminate datasets from R and G
with the maximum probability. In G’s turn, SD,G moves
towards SD,R which means that G is learning the be-
havior of R. Each turn ends when the optimal point of

the loss function is reached, or the iteration number goes
over a preset limit. As the adversarial learning process
goes on, the value of the loss function oscillates from turn
to turn and eventually converges to 0 indicating that the
learning arrives at a Nash equilibrium point, where G
is able to produce a mixed state ρG which resembles ρR
and D can no longer distinguish between them [3, 4].

learning. The density matrices ρR and the ﬁnal ρG are
plotted in Fig 2 (b), which yields a state ﬁdelity of around
0.999.

Now we apply the recipe to train the QGAN to repli-
cate the statistics of an XOR gate, which is a classical
gate with input-output rules 00 → 0, 01 → 1, 10 → 1,
and 11 → 0. We use the computational basis state |0(cid:105)
and |1(cid:105) to encode the classical data 0 and 1, respectively.
We randomly initialize the parameters of both D and
G, and then update them alternately following the rules
outlined above. The trajectories of the key parameters

benchmarking the QGAN performance during the train-
ing process are plotted in Fig. 3 (a), with the evolutions
of two representative parameters construcing D and G
shown in Fig. 3 (b). Again, the loss function exhibits
a typical oscillation during the adversarial process, and
the training reaches its equilibrium after about 190 steps
with an average state ﬁdelity of 0.927. In addition, af-
ter training G successfully exhibits a truth table close to
that of an XOR gate, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3 (a).
In conclusion, we have experimentally implemented a
multi-qubit QGAN equipped with a quantum gradient
algorithm on a programmable superconducting proces-
sor. The results clearly show the feasibility of QGAN
for learning data with both classical and quantum statis-
tics. The parameterized quantum circuits for construct-
ing quantum generators and discriminators do not re-
quire accurate implementations of speciﬁc quantum log-
ics and can be achieved on the near-term quantum de-
vices across diﬀerent physical platforms. Our implemen-
tation paves the way to the much-anticipated computing
paradigm with combined quantum-classical processors,
and holds the intriguing potential to realize practical
quantum supremacy [17] with noisy intermediate-scale
quantum devices [26].

DETAILS ABOUT THE QUANTUM DEVICE

Our experimental device is a superconducting circuit
consisting of 20 transmon qubits interconnected by a
central bus resonator with frequency ﬁxed at around
ωR/2π ≈ 5.51 GHz. Five qubits, denoted as Qj for j = 0
to 4, are actively used in this work. Each qubit has its
own microwave control and ﬂux bias lines for implemen-
tations of XY and Z rotations respectively. Meanwhile,
each qubit is dispersively coupled to its own readout res-
onator for qubit-state measurement, and all the qubits
can be measured simultaneously using the frequency-
domain multiplexing technique. Details about the fab-
rication process, circuits layout, and quantum manipula-
tion of the device can be found in Ref. [1, 2].

Single-qubit operations and qubit-state measurements
are performed at each qubit’s idle frequency ωj,idle as
listed in Table S1. These frequencies are carefully ar-
ranged to minimize the crosstalk eﬀects. Other im-
portant parameters of the ﬁve qubit are also listed in
Table S1, with their corresponding benchmarking data
shown in Fig. S1. Both the X and X/2 gates are de-
signed following the DRAG theory [3] with a length of
30 ns and a full width half maximum of 15 ns. Their
ﬁdelities are no less than 0.9976 characterized by ran-
domized benchmarking (Fig. S1 (c)). Repeated readout
pulses, which are 1.5 µs in length, are demodulated at
room temperature, yielding the I − Q points for each
qubit on the complex plane forming two blobs to diﬀer-
entiate its states |0(cid:105) and |1(cid:105) (Fig. S1 (d)). The proba-
bilities of correctly reading out each qubit in |0(cid:105) and |1(cid:105)
monitored over 40 hours are shown in Fig. S1 (e), with
the corresponding mean values listed in Table S1.

MULTI-QUBIT ENTANGLING GATES

The multi-qubit entangling gates that comprise G and
D in our QGANs are generated by tuning all the involved
qubits on-resonance at around 5.165 GHz, which is de-
tuned from the resonator frequency by 345 MHz. Single-
qubit phase gates, which are realized by amplitude-
adjustable Z square pulses with a width of 20 ns, are
added on each qubit before and after the interaction pro-
cess to cancel out the dynamical phases accumulated dur-
ing it. In our experiment, the two- and three- qubit en-
tangling gates contain Q3, Q4 and Q1, Q2, Q3 respec-
tively. The characteristic interaction time tgate is ﬁxed
at π/4|λ|, where λ is negative and approximately equals
to (cid:101)g2/∆. (cid:101)g is deﬁned as the average qubit-resonator cou-

THE GRADIENT VERIFICATION

TWO-QUBIT CONTROLLED GATES

Two types of controlled gates,

i.e., controlled-X
(CNOT) and controlled-Z (CZ) gates, are frequently used
to fulﬁll the quantum gradient subroutine in QGANs.
Both gates are made from a two-qubit phase gate Uphase
whose unitary matrix is shown in Fig. S3 (a), combined
with some single-qubit gates as shown in Fig. S3 (b) and

The gradient is a critical ingredient required in the op-
timization procedure of generative adversarial networks
(GANs). In this work, a quantum algorithm known as
the Hadamard test is implemented experimentally for the
ﬁrst time to obtain the gradient. Now we introduce the
basic idea of this algorithm.

The proof of the last equation can be found in Ref. [5].
As such, the partial derivative of (cid:104)O(cid:105) can be measured as
−(cid:104)σz(cid:105) of the ancillary qubit.
In our experiment, since
the parameterized unitaries are all single-qubit gates,
only two-qubit controlled gates are required to obtain
the quantum gradient (QG). Nevertheless, the ability to
realize two-qubit controlled gates between the ancillary
qubit and all the other qubits in the system is still a non-
trivial task and relies on the all-to-all connectivity of the
quantum processor.

We test the QG approach with a simple parameter-
ized quantum circuit as shown in Fig. S5 (a), where we
ﬁrst rotate Q1 around the x-axis by an angle θ and then
measure its (cid:104)σz
1(cid:105). Our goal is to measure the gradient
1(cid:105) with respect to θ, i.e., ∂(cid:104)σz
of (cid:104)σz
1(cid:105)/∂θ. The variation
of (cid:104)σz
1(cid:105) versus θ is directly measured, with the results
shown in Fig. S5 (b). Based on this measurement, we
can calculate ∂(cid:104)σz
1(cid:105)/∂θ by the CLCU approach, and the
In comparison, we can

also calculate the gradient by adopting the QG circuit
as shown in Fig. S5 (c) and measure (cid:104)σz
0(cid:105) of Q0. The
gradient can be obtained by ∂(cid:104)σz
0(cid:105) with the
results shown in Fig. S5 (d). Due to the inﬁdelities of
our two-qubit controlled gates, the quantum gradient is
slightly smaller than the ideal value. In practice, there
may be a delay between the two controlled gates which
will introduce a dephasing error to Q0 and aﬀect the ac-
curacy of QG. Such an error can be reduced experimen-
tally by the single-qubit dynamical decoupling (1Q-DD)
technique [4], which is realized by applying a continuous

to (cid:126)θ, where (cid:126)θ = [θ1, θ2, ..., θj, ..., θN ]. According to the
parameter shift rules, we can measure the analytic gra-
dient with the ‘classical linear combinations of unitaries
(CLCU)’ method [6] which requires the direct detection
of (cid:104)O(cid:105).

shift in the middle. To check that, we deliberately intro-
duce a delay of τ = 800 ns in between the two controlled
gates, and compare the results with and without the 1Q-
DD protection. The Rabi frequency of the driving ﬁeld
in 1Q-DD is set to Ω/2π = 2 MHz in the experiment. An
obvious enhancement is observed as expected.

ing the time between two controlled gates, we implement
1Q-DD technique on Q0 to protect it from dephasing as
introduced in the previous section.

STABILITY DURING TRAINING

The stabilities of qubit operations are of great impor-
tance for the successful running of our QGANs. Except
for the readout ﬁdelities as shown in Fig. S1 (e), we also
monitor the performances of multi-qubit gates during a
40-hour training time. Instead of benchmarking the gates
by QPT which is rather time-consuming, we select sev-
eral representative states as inputs and monitor the cor-
responding output states by measuring the probabilities
of all the qubits in |1(cid:105). The results for the Uphase gates
on four pairs of qubits, i.e., Q0-Q1, Q0-Q2, Q0-Q3 and
Q0-Q4, are presented in Fig. S7 (a)-(d). The variations of
probabilities for all those gates are no more than 0.036.
The results for two- and three-qubit entangling gates ap-
plied on Q3-Q4 and Q1-Q2-Q3 are shown in Fig. S7 (e)
and (f), with the variations of probabilities being 0.063
and 0.057 respectively. All results show that the per-
formance of our multi-qubit gates is suﬃciently stable
during the QGANs training.
