Abstract— Probabilistic (p-) bits implemented with low energy barrier nanomagnets (LBMs) have recently gained attention 
because  they  can  be  leveraged  to  perform  some  computational  tasks  very  efficiently.  Although  more  error-resilient  than 
Boolean computing, p-bit based computing employing LBMs is, however, not completely immune to defects and device-to-
device  variations.  In  some  tasks  (e.g.  binary  stochastic  neurons  for  machine  learning  and  p-bits  for  population  coding), 
extended defects, such as variation of the LBM thickness over a significant fraction of the surface, can impair functionality. In 
this paper, we have examined if unavoidable geometric device-to-device variations can have a significant effect on one of the 
most critical requirements for probabilistic computing, namely the ability to “program” probability with an external agent, such 
as a spin-polarized current injected into the LBM. We found that the programming ability is fortunately not lost due to reasonable 
device-to-device variations. The little variation in the probability versus current characteristic that reasonable device variability 
causes can be suppressed further by increasing the spin polarization of the current. This shows that probabilistic computing 
with LBMs is robust against small geometric variations, and hence will be “scalable” to a large number of p-bits.

INTRODUCTION 

Probabilistic p-bits are random bits which fluctuate between 0 
and 1 [1]. They are neither deterministic bits used in classical Boolean 
logic,  nor  qubits  which  are  coherent  superposition  of  0  and  1. 
Probabilistic  computing  with  p-bits  encoded  in  the  magnetization 
states  of  low  energy  barrier  nanomagnets  (LBMs)  is  extremely 
energy-efficient  and  far  more  error-resilient  than  energy-efficient 
Boolean computing with nanomagnets, which is normally very error-
prone  [2].  Computing  with  p-bits  has  also  been  shown  to  excel  in 
certain tasks such as combinatorial optimization [3], invertible logic 
[4] and integer factorization [5].  

A  popular  platform  for  implementing  p-bits  is  a  low  barrier 
nanomagnet (LBM) with two degenerate energy minima separated by 
a  low  energy  barrier  on  the  order  of  the  thermal  energy  kBT  (kB  = 
Boltzmann  constant  and  T  =  absolute  temperature)  [1].  In  such  a 
nanomagnet,  the  magnetization  will  fluctuate  between  the  two 
orientations  corresponding  to  the  two  degenerate  energy  minima 
because  of  thermal  fluctuations.  If  we  take  a  snapshot  of  the 
magnetization at any instant of time, it will point in a random direction. 
However,  if  its  component  along  one  of  the  two  orientations  is 
positive, then we will interpret the magnetization to represent the bit 
1, while if it is negative, we will interpret it as bit 0. The bit will thus

always fluctuate between 0 and 1 (sometimes 0 and sometimes 1) and 
act as a p-bit.  

If the energy barrier is symmetric between the two degenerate 
minima, then bits 0 and 1 will be generated with equal probability. 
However,  one  can  change  that  by  passing  a  spin  polarized  current 
through  the  nanomagnet  with  spins  polarized  along  one  of  the  two 
orientations. This will bias the probability, either toward 0 or toward 
1, depending on the current’s magnitude and spin polarization (say, 
for  example,  30%  probability  of  0  and  70%  of  1  for  a  current  of 
magnitude 1 A with spins polarized in the direction representing bit 
1). Such an approach provides a means to “program” the probability, 
which is the basis of probabilistic computing. It is also the basis of 
binary  stochastic  neurons  frequently  used  in  stochastic  neural 
networks and machine learning. 

The programmability (or “control”) will be lost if the magnitude 
of  the  current  needed  for  a  particular  probability  distribution  (e.g. 
30% for 0 and 70% for 1) varies significantly from one nanomagnet 
to  another  because  of  small  variations  in  the  nanomagnet’s  lateral 
dimensions  or  thickness.  This  will  be  debilitating  for  probabilistic 
computing  and,  at  best,  limit  the  number  of  p-bits  that  can  be 
harnessed  to  build  a  “p-circuit”,  thereby  making  p-bits  suffer  from 
similar limitations on scalability that afflict qubits. It is this problem 
that we study. In the past, we have shown that extended defects in an 
LBM  (e.g.  thickness  variation  over  a  significant  fraction  of  the

which will, respectively, affect applications in, say, binary stochastic

these are less serious than losing control over the probability because 
the latter is crucial to probabilistic computing. Therefore, it is critical 
to  examine  the  effect  of  device-to-device  variations  caused  by 
fabrication imperfections on the ability to control probability in LBMs.

To investigate this issue, we have carried out stochastic Landau-
Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations to study magnetization fluctuations in an 
LBM (with in-plane magnetic anisotropy) at room temperature in the 
presence  of  a  spin  polarized  current  injected  perpendicular  to  the 
plane  of  the  LBM.  These  simulations  allow  us  to  generate  the 
probability of bit 1 (encoded in the magnetization state of the LBM) 
as a function of the spin polarized current magnitude and polarization, 
and  examine  how  this  probability  function  varies  with  small 
variations in the nanomagnet’s lateral dimensions and thickness. Our 
results show that the probability function is insensitive to reasonable 
variations.  This  is  reassuring  since  it  establishes  that  probabilistic 
computing with p-bits is not impaired by reasonable device-to-device 
variation and hence a large number of p-bits can be harnessed for p-
circuits, meaning that p-bits are largely scalable.

 SIMULATIONS 

We  consider  an  elliptical  cobalt  nanomagnet  of  nominal 
thickness 6 nm, major axis 100 nm and minor axis 99.7 nm (Fig. 1). 
This nanomagnet has in-plane magnetic anisotropy and because it has 
very small eccentricity (nearly circular), the shape anisotropy energy 
barrier  separating  the  two  stable  orientations  along  the  major  axis 
(easy axis) is only 2.45 kBT at room temperature. We follow the time 
evolution of the magnetization in this nanomagnet in the presence of 
thermal noise and a spin-polarized current injected perpendicular to 
plane  with  spin  polarization  along  the  major  axis  by  solving  the 
stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation:

The last term in the right hand side of Equation (1) is the field-like 
spin  transfer  torque  and  the  second  to  last  term  is  the  Slonczewski

III.  RESULTS 

We run 10,000 simulations of the magnetization dynamics for 
each value of spin polarized current (in steps of 0.1 mA) and calculate 
the fraction of simulations where the final state after 10 ps represents 
the bit 1. That fraction is the probability that the p-bit is 1 or P(1). If 
we had monitored the bit as a function of time, this would have been 
the  probability  of  observing  the  bit  as  1,  based  on  ergodicity. 
Obviously, P(0) is always 1 – P(1), where P(0) is the probability that 
the p-bit is 0. In Fig. 2, we show P(1) as a function of the magnitude 
and spin polarization of the spin polarized current for four different 
nanomagnet  thicknesses  of  5  nm,  6  nm,  7  nm  and  15  nm.  Positive 
current  corresponds  to  spin  polarization  along  the  +z-axis  and 
negative  current  corresponds  to  polarization  along  the  –z-axis.  We 
plot the results for two different degrees of spin polarization  in the 
current: 30% and 70%. 

Fig. 2: The probability of bit 1 as a function of spin polarized current for four 
different nanomagnet thicknesses of 5, 6, 7 and 15 nm. The major axis is 100 
nm and the minor axis is 99.7 nm. The results are plotted for two different 
degrees of spin polarization in the current: 30% and 70%. The variation in 
the probability at any given current is reduced at higher spin polarization. 
Positive value of the current corresponds to spin polarization in the +z-
direction and negative values correspond to spin polarization in the –z-
direction. For these thicknesses, the energy barrier heights are respectively 
1.7 kBT, 2.45 kBT, 3.33 kBT and 15.29 kBT

major axis dimension is fixed at 100 nm and the thickness is 6 nm. The 
results are plotted for two different degrees of spin polarization in the 
current: 30% and 70%. As in Fig. 2, the variation is reduced at higher spin 
polarization.

reproducible  and  it  is  possible  to  make  multiple  generators  with 
nominally  identical  characteristics  because  the  device-to-device 
variation in the characteristics will be small. That also tells us that p-
bits  implemented  with  low  energy  barrier  nanomagnets  will  be 
scalable up to a large number of p-bits because of the immunity to 
device-to-device variation. 

In  Fig.  3  we  show  P(1)  as  a  function  of  the  magnitude  and 
degree  of  spin  polarization  in  the  spin  polarized  current  for  four 
different minor axis dimensions of 99.7 nm, 99 nm, 98 nm and 90 nm 
(the major axis is fixed at 100 nm and the thickness is fixed at 6 nm). 
We keep the aspect ratio (major axis to minor axis dimension ratio) 
small  enough  so  that  the energy  barrier  in  the  nanomagnet  remains 
sufficiently low (the energy barriers are 2.45 kBT, 8.16 kBT, 16.34 kBT 
and 81.62 kBT for the four different minor axis dimensions). When 
the minor axis is 90 nm, the energy barrier is obviously too high to 
qualify  the  nanomagnet  as  a  “low  barrier  nanomagnet”.  Yet,  even 
with that much variation in the barrier height (3300%), the probability 
curves change very little, showing that the probability versus current 
characteristic  is  very  insensitive  to  barrier  height  variation  in  this 
regime. Comparing Figs. 2 and 3, we find that the probability versus 
current  characteristic is  much  more  insensitive to  lateral  dimension 
variation  than  thickness  variation.  This  is  fortunate  since  lateral 
dimension  is  more  difficult  to  control  since  it  is  defined  by 
lithography than thickness which is defined by film growth. 

In Fig. 3, we show the plots for two different degrees of spin 
polarization  in the current: 30% and 70%. The higher degree of spin 
polarization  again  suppresses  the  variability  just  as  in  the  case  of 
thickness variation. 

The shapes of the probability curves in Figs. 2 and 3 are very 
similar to that in ref. [1], which explained the shape. At zero current, 
there will be no more preference for the p-bit to be 1 than to be 0. 
Hence, the probabilities of the p-bit being 0 and 1 will be equal and 
each will be exactly 0.5, like an unbiased coin with equal probability 
of head and tail. This is, of course, what we also observe. The current 
“biases”  the  probability  toward  either  0  or  1  depending  on  the 
direction  of  its  spin  polarization.  At  very  high  current  levels,  the 
probability of the p-bit being 1 will be nearly 100% for one sign of 
spin polarization and 0% for the other sign. Hence, P(1)  will saturate 
to  0  for  very  high  current  of  one  polarization  and  1  for  very  high 
current of the opposite polarization. As a result, the probability P(1) 
will  have  a  dependence  on

IV.  CONCLUSION 

Clearly,  the  plots  show  that  the  probability  curves  are  not 
affected much by reasonable variations in either thickness or lateral 
dimensions.  In  the  case  of  thickness  variation,  we  see  a  significant 
difference only for the 15 nm thickness. Variation in thickness by  1  
nm  is  reasonable  since  nanomagnets  are  usually  fabricated  on 
substrates with surface roughness of 0.3 nm, but the 15 nm thickness 
would require the thickness to vary by 9 nm from the target thickness 
of 6 nm and is not reasonable. Therefore, we can conclude that the 
probability  curves  are  not  affected  significantly  by  reasonable 
thickness variations.  

Variation in the lateral dimension (minor axis length) is even 
more forgiving. A variation of more than 9 nm, which is 9% of the 
minor axis dimension, does not make a significant difference in the 
probability  curves.  The  little  variation  that  there  is  can  be  further 
suppressed by increasing the degree of spin polarization in the current. 
All  this  means  that  the  controlled  probability  generators  are  very 

Increasing  the  degree  of  spin  polarization  also  decreases 
(expectedly)  the  magnitude  of  the  current  needed  to  pin  the  bit  to 
either 0 or 1. All this is reassuring since it implies that the “control” 
over p-bits exercised with spin polarized current is not impaired by 
reasonable  device-to-device  variations  and  therefore  a  fairly  large 
number  of  p-bits  can  be  harnessed  for  “p-circuits”  in  many 
applications,  i.e.  p-bits  are  generally  “scalable”.  This  is  in  sharp 
contrast  to  qubits  where  only  a  small  number  can  be  entangled  for 
quantum operations (the largest number entangled so far appears to 
be  53  [13])  because  of  decoherence.  Classical  p-bits  do  not  suffer 
from decoherence and their scalability does not appear to be severely 
limited  by  reasonable  device-to-device  variations  either.  Some 
specific applications may still be vulnerable to defects [5, 6], but the 
practicality of implementing p-bits with LBMs is unassailable. 

Finally, we clarify that the variations we have considered are 
uniform variations in thickness and lateral dimensions. Studying the 
effect of spatially inhomogeneous variations (e.g. surface roughness) 
would  require  running  micromagnetic  simulations 
instead  of 
macrospin  simulations  (stochastic  Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert).  Since 
running 10,000 micromagnetic simulations for each current value will 
be computationally prohibitive, we have not addressed the effect of 
spatially  inhomogeneous  variations  (e.g.  surface  roughness)  here. 
That will be addressed in a future work.
