Abstract: Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) have now been widely used for industry applications
and also played more important roles in fundamental researches. Although most ANN hardware
systems are electronically based, optical
implementation is particularly attractive because of
its intrinsic parallelism and low energy consumption. Here, we propose and demonstrate fully-
functioned all optical neural networks (AONNs), in which linear operations are programmed by
spatial light modulators and Fourier lenses, and optical nonlinear activation functions are realized
with electromagnetically induced transparency in laser-cooled atoms. Moreover, all the errors from
diﬀerent optical neurons here are independent, thus the AONN could scale up to a larger system
size with ﬁnal error still maintaining in a similar level of a single neuron. We conﬁrm its capability
and feasibility in machine learning by successfully classifying the order and disorder phases of a
typical statistic Ising model. The demonstrated AONN scheme can be used to construct various
ANNs of diﬀerent architectures with the intrinsic parallel computation at the speed of light.

Machine learning techniques, especially artiﬁcial neu-
ral networks (ANNs), have seen signiﬁcant growth in the
past decades and been demonstrated to be powerful or
even surpass the human intelligence in various ﬁelds like
image recognition, medical diagnosis and machine trans-
lation [1, 2]. ANNs also show great potential in scientiﬁc
researches [3–6], especially in discovering new materials
[7], classifying phases of matter [8, 9], representing varia-
tional wave functions [10], accelerating Monte Carlo sim-
ulations [11, 12], etc. They may be used to solve some
problems which are intractable in conventional appraches
[13–20]. The magic power of an ANN comes from the
extensive interconnections among a large amount of neu-
rons as those in a human brain, while such a large amount
of neurons and interconnections require huge computa-
tional resources (time and energy) when they are imple-
mented with digital computers [1].

Unlike electrons in a digit computer, photons as non-
interacting bosons could be naturally used to realize mul-
tiple interconnections and simultaneous parallel calcula-
tions at the speed of light [21–27]. The key ingredients of
an ANN are the artiﬁcial neurons, which perform both
linear and nonlinear transformations for the input sig-
nals.
In most hybrid optical neural networks (ONNs),
optics is mainly used for linear operations and the non-
linear functions are usually implemented electronically
[28–31]. Recently ONNs basing on nanophotonic circuits
[32] and light-wave linear diﬀraction and interference [33]
have been demonstrated for eﬃcient machine learning,
but the nonlinear optical activation functions are still in
absence for deep networks [31, 34]. Although there have
been proposals for implementing nonlinear optical activa-
tion functions [35, 36], their experimental realization has

become the bottleneck for further extension of ONNs in
practical applications.

In this work, we demonstrate all optical neural net-
works (AONNs) with both tunable linear operations and
non-linear activation functions in optics. We use spatial
light modulators (SLMs) and Fourier lenses to implement
the linear operations. The all optical non-linear activa-
tion functions are realized based on electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT) [37, 38] - a light-induced
quantum interference eﬀect among atomic transitions.
To verify the capability and feasibility of the AONN
scheme, we implement several two-layer fully-connected
AONNs and use them to successfully classify diﬀerent
phases in a prototypical Ising model.

In a typical ANN as illustrated in Fig. 1(a), neurons
are usually arranged in layered structures without con-
nections between diﬀerent neurons in the same layer,
and the output from the neurons in one layer serves
as the input for the neurons in next layer. The work-
ing principle of an artiﬁcial neuron can be abstracted
into two steps: 1) receiving multiple weighted Wij input
signals vj from neurons in the preceding layer through
a linear operation and adding some linear bias bi, i.e.,
zi = bi + (cid:80)
j Wijvj, and 2) generating new output sig-
nal ai processing all the input signals through nonlinear
activation functions ai = φ(zi). In our optical conﬁgura-
tion, the linear operation is implemented by a SLM and
an adjacent Fourier lens, and the nonlinear activitation
function is realized with EIT as shown in Fig. 1 (b). Dif-
ferent from the diﬀractive ONNs where the electric-ﬁeld
neurons are compelx [33], in our AONN the signals are
encoded in light power, thus vi, zi, ai ≥ 0, and the real
matrix elements satisfy 1 ≥ Wij ≥ 0.

In the linear operation process, the incident light pow-
ers at diﬀerent areas in the SLM represent the input layer
nodes vj. By imposing multiple phase gratings, the in-
cident light beam vi can be split into diﬀerent directions
j with weight Wij. The SLM is placed at the back focal
plane of the lens, which performs Fourier transform and

FIG. 2. (color online) Linear operation and characterization.
(a) Optical setup. FM: ﬂip mirror; M: mirror; L1-L4: optical
lens. The coupling laser beam emitted from a single mode
ﬁber (SMF) is collimated by the lens L1 (f=10 cm) and il-
luminates the surface of SLM1 (Leto, Holoeye), where it is
selectively reﬂected to 8 separate light spots on the surface
of SLM2 (Pluto-2, Holoeye) by a 4-f imaging system with
lenses L2 (f=30 cm) and L3 (f=25 cm). A FM is inserted in
the optical path to optionally reﬂect the beam to camera C1,
which is located at the equivalent position of SLM2. SLM2
performs linear operation to tranform the 8 inputs to the 4
output beams, which are recorded by camera C2. (b) His-
togram of 2000 random input vectors with elements equally

itor and measure vj. The stray coupling light is blocked
at the Fourier plane of lens L2. After SLM2, each laser
beam is diﬀracted into 4 beams. The Fourier lens L4 per-
forms a summation operation and the 4 output spots are
recorded by the second camera (C2). To characterize the
accuracy of the input vectors vj, we measure error dis-
tribution of 2000 random 8-dimension input vectors with
elements equally sampled from 0 to 1 [Fig. 2(b)]. As
depicted in Fig. 2(c), we obtain very accurate input vec-
tors with a standard deviation of only 0.017. The mean
of the error is slightly oﬀ zero, due to a possible laser
power drift during the measurement.

We next conﬁrm that an arbitrary positively-valued
8 × 4 matrix (1 ≥ Wij ≥ 0) can be realized by pro-
gramming SLM2. We take two types of linear operations
as examples. The ﬁrst is the Hankel matrix A, a typ-
ical symmetric matrix in mathematics whose elements
satisfy Aij = Ai+k,j−k(k = 0, . . . , j − i) (See Eqn. S1
in SM). Because we cannot directly measure the matrix

could be realized similarly. We obtain given matrix ele-
ments Wij following the Gerchberg-Saxton iterative feed-
back algorithm [39, 40], in which high accuracy (> 95%)
could be achieved in less than 10 iterations(See Fig. S1
in Supplementary Materials (SM) for details). Moreover,
it is worth to emphasize that one great advantage of this
method is that the error for a given spot does not depend
on the total number of spots as long as the resolution of
SLM is high enough, which is qualitatively diﬀerent from
the previous implementations [32, 33].

Figure 2(a) shows the optical layout for performing
the linear operation. Without losing generality, we take
an 8-to-4 linear operation as an example. The coupling
laser beam output from a single-mode ﬁber (SMF) is col-
limated and incident to the ﬁrst SLM (SLM1), which se-
lectively reﬂect 8 separate beam spots. These 8 spots are
then imaged onto the second SLM (SLM2) as the input
vj through a 4-f optical lens system (L2 and L3). The ﬂip
mirror (FM) and the ﬁrst camera (C1) are used to mon-

tion. We work with laser-cooled 85Rb atoms in a dark-
line two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT) [41]
with a longitudinal length of 1.5 cm and an aspect ratio
of 25:1, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The atoms are prepared in
the ground state |1(cid:105), as shown in the atomic energy level
digram in Fig. 3(b). The circularly polarized (σ+) cou-
pling laser (ωc) beams, which are from the outputs of the
linear operation, are on resonance to the atomic transmis-
sion |2(cid:105) ↔ |3(cid:105) and incident to the atomic cloud along its
transverse direction. A counter-propagating probe laser
beam (ωp, σ+) is on resonance to |1(cid:105) → |3(cid:105). In absence of
the coupling beam, the atomic medium is opaque to the
resonant probe beam which is maximumly absorbed by
the atoms, as shown as the solid curve in the transmission
spectrum of Fig. 3(c). While in presence of the coupling
beam, the quantum interference between the transition
paths leads to an EIT [37, 38] transparency spectral win-
dow as shown as the dashed curve in Fig. 3(c), where
the on-resonance peak transmission and the bandwidth
are controlled by the coupling laser intensity. The on-
resonance probe laser beam output can be expressed as

c),

(1)

where Ip,in and Ip,out are the input and output probe
beam intensity, OD is the atomic optical depth on the
|1(cid:105) → |3(cid:105) transition, and γij is the dephasing rate be-
tween the states |i(cid:105) and |j(cid:105). For 85Rb atoms, γ13 = 2π×3
MHz, and the non-zero ground-state dephasing rate γ12
can be tuned by the stray background magnetic ﬁeld.
Ωc is the coupling ﬁeld Rabi frequency and its square is
proportional to the coupling laser intensity (Ω2
c ∝ Ic).
As shown in Eq. (1), the probe beam intensity is non-
linearly controlled by the coupling beam intensity. The
nonlinear activation function ϕ is achieved by taking the
coupling intensity as the input and the transmitted probe
intensity as the output. In experiment, the input probe
beam is collimated and its beam size is large enough to
cover the entire coupling beam proﬁle. Moreover, Equa-
tion (1) also indicates that the the nonlinear activation
function is determined by OD and γ12 whose values are
diﬀerent at diﬀerent positions of the MOT. Therefore, by
placing the counter-propagating coupling-probe beams at
diﬀerent positions of the MOT, we can achieve diﬀer-
ent nonlinear activation functions for diﬀerent neurons.
Figure 3(d) shows nearly identical nonlinear activation
functions are obtained by carefully positioning the four
input coupling beams. We can also assign these 4 neurons
with diﬀerent nonlinear activation functions, as shown in
Fig. 3(e). Clearly, the errors from diﬀerent nonlinear
active functions are also independent. Together with the
same advantages of linear operations realized by SLMs
and lenses, the AONN scheme could be expected to scale
up to large size with error maintained in a small level.

After the demonstration of linear and nonlinear opera-
tions, we are ready to assemble a fully functioned AONN
using SLMs, lenses, MOT, the coupling and probe laser
beams. Next we will show that we can actually apply
such an AONN to classify diﬀerent phases in condensed

elements, we take the error distribution of output vec-
tors using the 2000 random input vectors described pre-
viously. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the errors (|(cid:126)z − (cid:126)z(cid:48)|) are
very small with a standard deviation of 0.014, where (cid:126)z
and (cid:126)z(cid:48) are the exact and measured vectors respectively.
Impressively, they are almost the same as the errors of
input vectors even though much more operations are in-
volved here. This result further indicates that the error
could maintain in a small level even for multiple linear
operations, which is crucial for large scale AONNs. For
matrix production, the directions of output vectors are
more useful than the exact value of diﬀerent elements,
the accuracy of which could be captured by the ﬁdelity
(cid:126)z· (cid:126)z(cid:48)
. As shown in Fig. 2(e), the ﬁdelity distribution is
|(cid:126)z|| (cid:126)z(cid:48)|
narrower than the error, and the mean value of ﬁdelity
is around 99.8% for Hankel matrix. The high ﬁdelity
suggests that although there are some uncertainties for
single elements, the output vectors are actually insen-
sitive to these ﬂuctuations. We also perform the same
measurements for a random matrix and obtain similar
results (see Eqn. S2 and Fig. S3 in SM for more details).

FIG. 4. (color online) Fully functioned 2-layer all optical neural network (AONN). (a) Experimental conﬁguration of the two-
layer AONN. The input layer is the pattern encoded on SLM1 whose area is divided into multiple subareas. The ﬁrst layer
consists of a linear operation done by SLM1 and EIT nonlinear activation functions at MOT. The second layer contains SLM2
which converts four beams into two output beams at camera C3. The collimated coupling laser beam passing lens L1 (f=10
cm) is incident on the SLM1 which generate four beams at the focal plane of L3 (f=75 cm). A ﬂip mirror (FM) and camera
C1 are used to monitor this linear operation. The four beams are imaged on the MOT through a 4-f system consisting of L4
(f=75 cm) and L5 (f=5 cm). A collimated probe laser is propagating along the opposite direction of the coupling beam, which
is imaged on camera C2 through L5 and L6 (f=45 cm). With further ampliﬁcation by L7 (f=7.5 cm) and L8 (f=45 cm), four
beams are incident on SLM2 and generate two beams and then are focused on camera C3. (b) and (c) are the mean probability
of the order (blue) and disorder (red) phases as functions of temperature for 100 and 4000 conﬁgurations respectively. The

matter physics. It has been demonstrated recently that
neural networks have great potentials to identify diﬀerent
phases including both symmetry-breaking phases [8, 9]
and topological phases [8, 15]. Here we take the proto-
typical two-dimension Ising model on square lattice as an
example for the demonstration. The Ising model could
be written as H(σ) = −J (cid:80)
(cid:104)ij(cid:105) σiσj, where σi = ±1 rep-
resents localized spin on site i, and (cid:104)ij(cid:105) takes the sum-
mation over all the nearest neighbors. It is well known
that there will be a continuous phase transition with the
|J|. In the follow-
critical temperature as Tc =
ing simulations and experiments, the interaction strength
is set to be J = 1, and we take lattice size L = 4 with
periodic boundary conditions as examples. We found a 2-
layer fully-connected neural network (FCNN) could work
well by using the experimentally measured nonlinear ac-
tivation functions in Fig. 3(e). Same as that in a conven-
tional electronic computer, our 2-layer AONN consists of
one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer.
Optical signal propagates from one layer to the next layer
through optical operation units. At the hidden layer, op-
tical information is processed by optical nonlinear active
functions before propagating to the output layer.

The detailed optical

implementation of the 2-layer
AONN is illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The input layer con-
tains L2 neurons with L as the linear system size. For

the hidden and output layers, there are 4 and 2 neurons,
respectively. In this particular conﬁguration, because the
input values are binary (0 or 1), the coupling beam input
vector and the ﬁrst linear operation can be realized by
a single SLM, as shown as SLM1 in Fig. 4(a) (See Eqn.
S5 in SM for details). The horizontally polarized output
coupling beam passes through a polarizing beam splitter
(PBS) and is incident to the cold atoms in MOT. The 4
transmitted counter-propagating and vertically polarized
probe beams are reﬂected by the PBS and enters SLM2
for a second linear operation which reduce the 4 inputs to
2 outputs recorded by camera C3. The FMs and cameras
C1 and C2 are used for conﬁguring the network param-
eters.

The 2-layer FCNN is initially trained in computer and
later ﬁnely tuned in the AONN through supervised learn-
ing from the labelled raw conﬁgurations generated by
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. By using the conﬁgu-
rations generated at lower and high temperatures, the
AONN learns to label them as the ordered or disor-
dered. The fraction of ordered or disordered conﬁgura-
tions among all the samples can be regarded as the prob-
ability being in order or disorder states. Then the cross-
ing temperature with both probabilities at 50% could
be taken as the phase transition point. Thus, after ma-
chine learning, the 2-layer AONN is applied to identify

phase transition temperature (See Supplementary train-
ing of two-layer AONNs for details).

Figures 4(b) and (c) plot the mean probability of con-
ﬁguration sets generated at diﬀerent temperatures for
L2 = 42 = 16 inputs. In general, the experimental re-
sults can well reproduce the whole phase diagram even
though we only train the AONN at the temperatures far
away from the critical temperature. The experimental
phase transition temperature is close to the analytical
thermodynamical limit represented by the vertical dash
line as the number of sites goes to inﬁnite. It suggests
that the AONN successfully capture the essential fea-
tures, which distinguish the order and disorder phases.
To clearly show the performance of our AONN, we ﬁrst
intentionally did the experiments by using only 100 con-
ﬁgurations and the results are shown in Fig. 4(b).
In
the sense of phase classiﬁcation, the results are not very
good. It is reasonable since we only use very few conﬁg-
urations in a very large conﬁgure space (100 out of 24×4
∼ 0.15%). However, the results from our AONN and the
computer FCNN for the same conﬁgurations are nearly
identical for all the temperatures, which clearly shows
that our AONN has the same accuracy as the well trained
computer-based NN. To further demonstrate the capabil-
ity of our AONN, we then did the experiments with 4000
conﬁgurations. As expected, the phase transition curves
become smoother because the random errors from sta-
tistical ﬂuctuations are strongly reduced, and the optical
results are almostly the same as the computer data as
shown in Fig. 4(c). All these results conﬁrm that our
implementation of AONN is successful and indeed capa-
ble to classify diﬀerent phases for the Ising model.

In summary, we demonstrate an AONN scheme with
both tunable linear operations and nonlinear activation

functions. The linear interconnections are realized using
SLMs and optical lenses. The EIT optical nonlinear acti-
vation functions are based on quantum interference. For
demonstration, we constructed a 2-layer FCNN for clas-
sifying the phases of a prototypical Ising model. While in
this work, we focus mainly on the feasibility of the linear
operations and nonlinear activation functions, which are
the key ingredients of an ANN, the AONN is scalable to
a larger system size with more SLMs and EIT nonlinear
media, with a cost of longer learning time in ﬁnely tun-
ing the network parameters. The reasons are two-fold:
(1) As the magic power of ANNs comes from the exten-
sive interconnections between a large mount of neurons,
ANNs are error-tolerant and robust against small local
random errors, which means even the local parameters
are not precise we can still get very good results as long
as the number of neurons is large enough just as human
brains. For most of problems, more neurons in ANNs
usually give better performance; (2) As clearly demon-
strated in our experiments, the ﬁnal error of our AONN
is insensitive to the total number of neurons and the er-
ror could maintain in a similar level as a single neuron
even for large scale AONNs. Such a big advantage inher-
its from the fact that all the linear and nonlinear active
functions in our AONNs are independent and the errors
from diﬀerent optical neurons will not accumulate but
may cancel with each other. Implementing a large scale
AONN requires more engineering resources and we leave
it for future work.
