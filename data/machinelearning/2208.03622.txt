Abstract For general quadratically-constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), we
propose a parabolic relaxation described with convex quadratic constraints. An in-
teresting property of the parabolic relaxation is that the original non-convex feasible
set is contained on the boundary of the parabolic relaxation. Under certain assump-
tions, this property enables one to recover near-optimal feasible points via objective
penalization. Moreover, through an appropriate change of coordinates that requires
a one-time computation of an optimal basis, the easier-to-solve parabolic relaxation
can be made as strong as a semideﬁnite programming (SDP) relaxation, which can
be effective in accelerating algorithms that require solving a sequence of convex sur-
rogates. The majority of theoretical and computational results are given in the next
part of this work [57].

1 Introduction

Ramtin Madani et al.

In this paper, we study the minimization of a quadratic objective function over a fea-
sible set that is also deﬁned by quadratic functions. This problem is referred to as
quadratically-constrained quadratic programming (QCQP). Physical laws and char-
acteristics of dynamical systems are widely modeled using quadratic functions. Ad-
ditionally, the general class of polynomial optimization problems can be reduced to
QCQP. Consequently, QCQP arises in a wide range of scientiﬁc and engineering
applications, such as power systems [51–53, 55], imaging science [8, 17, 28, 72],
signal processing [2, 7, 19, 48, 50, 60], automatic control [1, 27, 55, 76], quantum
mechanics [14, 26, 35, 46], and cybersecurity [22–24, 63]. The development of efﬁ-
cient optimization techniques and numerical algorithms for QCQP has been an active
area of research for decades. Although QCQP is NP-hard, specialized methods that
are robust and scalable are available for speciﬁc application domains. Notable exam-
ples for which methods with guaranteed performance has been offered in the litera-
ture include problems of multi-sensor beam-forming in communication theory [30],
phase retrieval in signal processing [16], and matrix completion in machine learning
[15, 62].

This paper advances convex relaxation framework for solving general QCQP
problems [20, 37, 44, 45, 61, 66, 69, 71]. A relaxation is said to be exact if it has the
same optimal objective value as the original problem. Convex relaxations have been
critically important for tackling non-convex optimization problems and their effec-
tiveness has been veriﬁed for numerous real-world problems [13, 40, 43, 73, 74]. For
challenging cases of QCQPs, convex relaxations offer effective approximation algo-
rithms [33, 34, 49, 65, 79–82]. For example, Geomans and Williamson [31] show that
the objective of a semideﬁnite programming (SDP) relaxation is within 14% of the
optimal value for the MAXCUT problem on graphs with non-negative weights. Ad-
ditionally, convex relaxations can be integrated within branch-and-bound algorithms
[12, 18] for ﬁnding near-optimal solutions to non-convex optimization problems. De-
spite solid theoretical guarantees, one of the primary challenges for the application
of existing convex relaxations beyond small-scale instances is the rapid growth of
dimensionality. In [67], for a single quadratic constraint and a set of linear equations,
the authors give a convex semi-inﬁnite program with non-convex quadratic inequali-
ties that achieves the standard SDP relaxation bound.

General purpose convex relaxations such as SDP have a wide variety of applica-
tions in many areas including machine learning [10, 25, 41], control theory [4, 5, 11],
and robotics [59, 75]. Historically, the lack of scalability has been a major imped-
iment to fulﬁlling the full potential of SDP for these application domains [58]. To
address scalability challenges, a number of approaches are pursued in the literature.
Several papers focus on leveraging structures such as symmetry and chordal spar-
sity [42, 77]. Another direction relies on the existence of low-rank solutions for SDP
[6, 9, 47, 54, 70]. Numerical algorithms such as the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) are used to tackle the scalability issues of second-order numer-
ical methods as well [68, 78, 83].

In this work, we offer an alternative convex relaxation for QCQP, namely parabolic
relaxation, which relies solely on convex quadratic inequalities, as opposed to SDP

constraints which can be computationally demanding [58]. An interesting property of
the parabolic relaxation is that the original non-convex feasible set is contained on the
boundary of the parabolic relaxation, which we refer to as the comprehensive bound-
ary property (CBP). Thanks to CBP, we prove that, under certain conditions, incorpo-
rating an appropriate linear penalty term in the objective of the parabolic relaxation
can remedy inexactness and lead to recovering high-quality feasible points for non-
convex QCQPs. This penalty term can be constructed based on an point which is
sufﬁciently close to the feasible set and satisﬁes a generalized linear independence
constraint qualiﬁcation (GLICQ) condition. In place of computationally demanding
relaxations such as SDP, we adopt a simple and tractable parabolic relaxation and a
sequential penalty approach to ﬁnd near-optimal feasible points.

In this part, we introduce the parabolic relaxation and prove that it satisﬁes the
comprehensive boundary property for QCQP. This is followed by a sequential pe-
nalized parabolic relaxation algorithm, and comparisons of the parapolic relaxation
with other approaches, such as SDP relaxation [66], SOCP relaxation [3], diagonally-
dominant (DD) and scaled diagonally-dominant (SDD) approximations [1] are pro-
vided. We also show that the lower bound obtained from the parabolic relaxation
can be made as strong as the SDP relaxation bound through an appropriate ba-
sis change. This result allows one to replace an SDP relaxation with a cheaper-
to-compute parabolic relaxation in algorithms that that require solving a sequence
of convex surrogates. Lastly, we provide examples comparing the relaxations and
demonstrating the sequential algorithm. The majority of theoretical and computa-
tional results are given in the second part of this work [57].

As a major beneﬁt, the proposed approach introduces a single variable per inner-

Indeed, one can cast problem (11a) – (11c) in a QCQP conical form (1a) – (1c) by
stacking the elements of Y in a vector and formulating the problem with respect to

3 Comprehensive Boundary Property

Polynomial-time solvable convex relaxations may be inexact when applied to general
non-convex optimization problems, in which case, the resulting solutions may be
infeasible for the original problem. In order to make a meaningful assessment of
the proposed parabolic relaxation, we ﬁrst introduce a desirable property, namely
the comprehensive boundary property (CBP), which is useful when one needs to
infer feasible points from inexact relaxations. The CBP ensures that every extreme
point which can be an optimal solution of the non-convex problem is included on
the boundary of the relaxed feasible set, which makes it attainable for an alternative
objective function. This notion is formally deﬁned next.

Moreover, as we will demonstrate later, CBP allows us to search for solutions by
solving a sequence of convex problems in a manner that membership to

served and the objective is monotonically improved. The success of the sequential
framework and penalization in solving bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs) demon-
strated in [36, 38, 39]. The incorporation of penalty terms into the objective of SDP
relaxations are proven to be computationally effective for solving non-convex opti-
mization problems in power systems [52, 53, 84, 85]. These papers show that pe-
nalizing certain physical quantities in power network optimization problems such as
reactive power loss or thermal loss facilitates the recovery of feasible points from
convex relaxations. In [36], a sequential framework is introduced for solving BMIs
without theoretical guarantees. This approach is investigated further and theoretical
results for the penalized SDP are derived [38, 39, 56].

This example also illustrates that the SOCP relaxation can be much weaker than
the parabolic relaxation from the standard basis. The computational studies in part
two of this work [57] show that, indeed, for most of the instances, the parabolic
relaxation from the standard basis is far superior compared to the SOCP relaxation;
however, it does not necessarily dominate the SOCP relaxation in general.

4 Sequential Penalized Parabolic Relaxation

In order to recover feasible points for cases where parabolic relaxation is not exact,
one can incorporate an additional linear term into the objective function to arrive at
a penalized convex problem. Given ˇY
m as an initial point and a constant
η > 0, the penalized convex relaxation is deﬁned as

The following two theorems guarantee that an appropriate choice of ˇY and η results
in a feasible point for the non-convex problem (11a) – (11c). In the second part,
we prove that the convex problem (21a) – (21e) has a unique solution ( ∗Y , ∗X) that
satisﬁes ∗X = ∗Y ∗Y (cid:62) for appropriate choices of η and under either of the following
conditions:
i) If ˇY is a feasible point for (11a) – (11c) that satisﬁes linear independence con-

straint qualiﬁcation (LICQ), or

ii) If ˇY

[57, Theorems 1 and 2]. In light of these theorems, we adopt a sequential framework

5 SDP Strength via Basis Update

In this section, we show that an appropriate choice of basis can result in a parabolic
relaxation that is as strong as SDP equipped with additional valid inequalities in the
direction of desired objective. To this end, consider the following SDP relaxation of
problem (11a) – (11c):

i.e., the parabolic relaxation with SDP-induced basis is as strong as SDP relaxation
for the minimization of ¯q0.

While it may seem counter-intuitive to solve an SDP to achieve the strength of
SDP bounds through the parabolic relaxation, the potential advantage is highlighted
for algorithms that require the solution of a sequence of similar relaxations, e.g.,
branch-and-bound or penalty reformulation methods. After a one-time computation
of an optimal basis, the cheaper-to-compute parabolic relaxation can replace costly
semideﬁnite programming (SDP) relaxations.

6 Comparisons with Related Relaxations, Restrictions, and Approximations

In this section, we discuss the relation between the parabolic relaxation and other
approaches. We cover the well-known SDP relaxation, as well as:

– Outer-approximations of SDP: Two variants of SOCP relaxation as well as DD

restriction of the dual space.

– Inner-approximations of SDP: DD and SDD approximation methods.

We show that in many ways, the parabolic relaxation improves upon the aforemen-
tioned approaches.

6.1 SDP relaxation

It is standard to relax the non-convex constraints (13d) as the SDP constraint

X

(cid:23)

Y Y (cid:62)

⇔

X Y
Y (cid:62) Im(cid:21)
(cid:20)

0,

(cid:23)

(29)

leading to an SDP relaxation of (1a) – (1c). Both SDP and parabolic relaxations share
CBP which makes them compatible with objective penalization and Algorithm 1.

14

Ramtin Madani et al.

a) Quality: In terms of quality, the parabolic relaxation is dominated by SDP relax-

ation, i.e.,

In section 5, it is shown that an appropriate choice of
results in a relax-
ation as strong as SDP. However, ﬁnding such basis can be as costly as solving
SDP relaxation, and therefore, it may be justiﬁable for cases where a sequence
of problems should be solved (e.g., through Algorithm 1 or branch-and-bound
search).

b) Complexity: In the presence of sparsity, large-scale SDP constraints of the form
(29) are decomposable into smaller ones through graph-theoretic analysis [29,
64]. Despite this possibility, a large body of literature recommends the use of
simpler relaxations such as SOCP, which allow the omission of those elements
in X that do not participate in the objective (13a) and constraints (13b) – (13c)
(see [58]). For sparse problems, the parabolic relaxation enjoys this advantage as
well, which makes it a viable alternative to SDP relaxation for a broad class of
real-world problems. For dense problems, the complexity of imposing (29) ver-
sus n2 convex quadratic constraints of the form (15d) – (15e) is highly-dependent
on the choice of numerical algorithm and the type of application. Such compari-
son requires and in-depth and case-by-case analysis of computational complexity
which is beyond the scope of this paper.

6.2 Outer-approximations of SDP relaxation

To alleviate the cost of solving large-scale semideﬁnite programs, it is common-
practice to substitute the constraint (29) with a set of conic inequalities of the form:

O(cid:62)k

approach is closely related to this method, since the parabolic relaxation inequalities

a) Quality: By investigating the dual parabolic relaxation (16a) – (16d), it can be
easily observed that this approach is dominated by the parabolic relaxation ap-
proach for m > 0, and it is effectively equivalent to the parabolic relaxation for
the homogeneous case.

b) Complexity: The dual DD programming enjoys lower computational complexity

due to its reliance on linear constraints.

First variant of SOCP relaxation (Dual SDD programming): The ﬁrst variant of
SOCP relaxation is ¯
conic inequali-

is how this method compares with the parabolic relaxation approach:

(2)
n,m, which in the worst case involves

(cid:17)

a) Quality: Unless in the homogeneous case, this relaxation is not stronger than
the parabolic relaxation in general, which is demonstrated by Example 7.1 and
benchmark QCQP problems in [57, Section 3.1].

b) Complexity: This variant of SOCP relaxation expands the sparsity pattern of the
m. This can potentially in-

problem by adding an additional clique of size m
crease complexity.

Second variant of SOCP relaxation: This variant of SOCP relaxation involves vec-
torization of Y by considering a variable:

as well as a lifted matrix variable representing yy(cid:62)

a) Quality: A direct comparison between this variant of SOCP and the ones intro-
duced in Deﬁnition 2 is not straightforward because the lifted variable belongs to
a higher-dimensional space Smn.

b) Complexity: This SOCP variant can negatively affect the sparsity pattern of the
problem by requiring a very large number of scalar variables accounting for the
elements of yy(cid:62)

Smn.

6.3 Inner-approximations of SDP relaxation

of SDP cone in the form of:

respectively. Despite the broad application of DD and SDD approximations in con-
trol theory [1], their main drawback for solving QCQP is that they are neither relax-
ations nor restrictions of the original non-convex feasible set
. Hence, in certain
applications the resulting inner-approximation can be empty or exclude meaningful
solutions. This is illustrated in the next section.

DD and SDD are neither inner- nor outer-approximations of the original feasible set.
On the other hand, SOCP relaxation in (5).C offers a loose relaxation compared to
the parabolic relaxation in (5).D.

As demonstrated in Figure 6, the change of basis allows us to use smaller η to
achieve feasibility. If η = 2, the objective value is
6.1146 which is 4.6% better
than penalization using standard basis and η = 3. Additionally, as shown in Table 2,
SDP-induced basis allow Algorithm 1 to arrive to optimality in 5 rounds using η = 1.

8 Conclusions

In this paper, we proposed a computationally efﬁcient convex relaxation, named
parabolic relaxation, for non-convex QCQPs. Parabolic relaxation includes all feasi-
ble points of the QCQP on its boundary, which is a favorable property for recovering
feasible points through penalty approaches. While the parabolic relaxation has sim-
ilar complexity as the common SOCP relaxation, through a basis change, it can be
equipped with a bounds as strong as SDP bound. As such, it compares favorably with
other relaxations/approximation for QCQP in the literature. In the second in the sec-
ond part of this work [57], we give a successive penalized relaxation algorithm and
prove its convergence to a KKT point. The experimental and theoretical results pro-
vided show the effectiveness of our proposed approach on benchmark QCQP cases
as well as the problem of identifying linear dynamical systems.
