Abstract: Tensioned cable nets can be used as supporting structures for the efﬁcient construction of
lightweight building elements, such as thin concrete shell structures. To guarantee important mechanical
properties of the latter, the tolerances on deviations of the tensioned cable net geometry from the
desired target form are very tight. Therefore, the form needs to be readjusted on the construction
site. In order to employ model-based optimization techniques, the precise identiﬁcation of important
uncertain model parameters of the cable net system is required. This paper proposes the use of Gaussian
process regression to learn the function that maps the cable net geometry to the uncertain parameters. In
contrast to previously proposed methods, this approach requires only a single form measurement for the
identiﬁcation of the cable net model parameters. This is beneﬁcial since measurements of the cable net
form on the construction site are very expensive. For the training of the Gaussian processes, simulated
data is efﬁciently computed via convex programming. The effectiveness of the proposed method and the
impact of the precise identiﬁcation of the parameters on the form of the cable net are demonstrated in
numerical experiments on a quarter-scale prototype of a roof structure.

1. INTRODUCTION

Doubly curved thin concrete shell structures are very efﬁcient
building structures, as they can be designed with a high stiff-
ness and structural stability (Tahmoorian et al., 2020; Palagi,
2020; Yang et al., 2019). Comparatively little material is needed
to span large areas, e.g. for roof structures. The construction
process requires a so-called formwork, which is a structure
supporting the concrete and deﬁning the form of the shell. Once
the concrete has cured, the formwork is removed. Traditional
formwork is usually fabricated using customized wooden parts
and is therefore time-, labor- and cost-intensive. It furthermore
requires a lot of material and produces a lot of waste. An
alternative ﬂexible formwork can be used instead, which con-
sists of a steel cable net tensioned inside a rigid frame. The
concrete is applied on top of the prestressed cable net and a
fabric layer. The amount of material used and waste produced
can considerably be reduced w.r.t. traditional formwork.

As the structural properties of the concreted shell crucially
depend on its form, the tolerances for the cable net geometry are
very tight. In order to meet these tolerances, the form of the pre-
tensioned cable net needs to be readjusted on the construction
site. This can be done by changing the lengths of the boundary
edges. Prior work in (St¨urz et al., 2016a) has introduced a
model-based feedback control strategy which minimizes the

deviations of the cable net geometry from the designed target
geometry. The form of the cable net in static equilibrium can
be mathematically described by nonlinear implicit equations
representing force balances at all interior nodes of the cable net.
Alternatively, for ﬁxed parameters and boundary conditions, the
form in static equilibrium can be computed by convex program-
ming (Lobo et al., 1998), (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004) as a
minimum energy state of the system.

It is known that some model parameters to which the cable
net form is sensitive are subject to high fabrication variations.
These parameters are the unstressed lengths of the cable edge
segments. In order for the control method to perform well,
either a robust control approach is required (St¨urz et al., 2020),
or the important uncertain parameters need to be precisely
identiﬁed. To do so, in (St¨urz et al., 2016b), methods were
proposed, which are based on multiple measurements of the
as-built cable net geometry. Measurements on the construction
site are very time-consuming and expensive and their number
should thus be minimized. To this end, both the identiﬁcation
step and the control step were combined into an iterative closed-
loop algorithm in (St¨urz et al., 2019), where after each form
measurement, the parameters are re-identiﬁed to update the
model which is then used to compute the next control inputs.
In this way, measurement information and model knowledge
can be exploited. In (St¨urz et al., 2019; Liew et al., 2018;
St¨urz, 2019), the proposed control strategy was validated on
experiments on a quarter-scale prototype of a doubly curved
roof shell.

The contributions of this paper are the following: We present
a method for the identiﬁcation of the important uncertain pa-

 
 
 
 
 
 
rameters of unstressed cable edge lengths based on Gaussian
process (GP) regression. While the function mapping the cable
net form to the uncertain parameters is not known analytically,
we exploit the fact that the inverse function can be formulated
as a convex optimization problem based on a minimum energy
approach. This allows us to efﬁciently generate training data
in simulation, based on which the mapping from the cable net
geometry to the parameters is learned. Using the trained GP,
only one set of form measurements from the construction site
is required to identify the uncertain parameters, rather than
performing a complete identiﬁcation procedure (Ljung, 1999).

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces prelim-
inaries about GP regression. In Section 3, the model of the cable
net system is presented and the problem formulation is stated.
Section 4 gives the main result of the paper, before numerical
experiments are given in Section 5.

In (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006), various candidates were
introduced for the choice of kernel. If the index set, X , is a

the kernel. The vector of hyperparameters is denoted by θ and
deﬁned as (λ1, . . . , λd, σf ).

In this section, we introduce some background on Gaussian

2.4 Hyperparameter Estimation

2.1 Gaussian Processes

P

n
i=1

Let X be a given set and RX denote the space of R-valued
functions deﬁned over X . A GP (Rasmussen and Williams,
2006) is a random object with values in RX with the spe-
ciﬁc property that its restriction to any ﬁnite subset of X
induces a normal distribution on the Euclidean space. More
precisely, let µ be a function as µ : X → R and k : X ×
X → R be a positive-deﬁnite kernel or covariance, i.e.,
for any n ∈ N, a1, . . . , an ∈ R and x1, . . . , xn ∈ X , we have
n
j=1 aiajk(xi, xj ) ≥ 0. Accordingly, we say f is a GP
with mean function µ and kernel k, denoted by f ∼ GP(µ, k),
P
if for any ﬁnite set of points {x1, . . . , xn} ⊆ X , the vector
[f (x1), . . . , f (xn)]
has a normal distribution with mean vec-
tor [µ(x1), . . . , µ(xn)]
and covariance matrix K = (Ki,j) ∈
Rn×n deﬁned as Ki,j = k(xi, xj), for all i, j ∈ Nn.
GPs provide prior distributions over the function space RX
as well as ﬂexible classes of models suitable for Bayesian
learning. The marginal and conditional means and variances
can be computed in a closed form due to the properties of
the Gaussian distributions. Accordingly, one can develop a
probabilistic non-parametric regression method (Rasmussen
and Williams, 2006) as brieﬂy discussed in the following.

2.2 Kriging or Gaussian Process Regression

Let f ∼ GP(µ, k) and XnD := {x1, . . . , xnD } ⊆ X . Also, for
κ = 1, . . . , nD, let yκ = f (xκ) + wκ, where w1, · · · , wnD are
measurement noise which are independent random variables

A common way to estimate the hyperparameters of the model
is maximizing the marginal likelihood, also known as evidence.
More precisely, the hyperparameters are estimated based on the
following optimization problem

ˆθ := argmax

θ∈Θ

p(ynD |XnD , θ),

(6)

where Θ is the feasible set of hyperparameters, and p denotes
the probability density function. This is equivalent to minimiz-
ing the negative log marginal likelihood (nlml). Although, this
problem is not convex, the derivatives of the objective function
can be calculated analytically, see (Rasmussen and Williams,
2006, Chapter 5).

3. CABLE NET MODEL AND PROBLEM
FORMULATION

In this section, we present the model of the cable net system
and the problem formulation.

3.1 Model of the Cable Net

The ﬂexible formwork consists of a supporting rigid frame and
a cable net which is prestressed inside the frame. All edges
of the net are in tension and form a doubly curved geometry.
We deﬁne the graph G = (V, E) to represent the topology of
the cable net. Each node i of the index set V is equipped with
the position coordinates ri = [rx,i ry,i rz,i]
. The position
coordinates of all nodes deﬁne the form of the cable net. The
edges with index set E represent the cable segments of the net.

a) Interior edge (sa, ta) ∈ EI connecting nodes sa ∈ VI
and ta ∈ VI . b) Boundary edge (sb, tb) ∈ EB connecting
the interior node s ∈ VI and the boundary node t ∈ VB.

We distinguish between the nB boundary nodes which are
positioned on the rigid frame where the cable net is attached,
and the nI interior nodes which lie in the interior of the net.
The same distinction is made for the edges, where the mB
boundary edges are directly connected to the rigid frame. The
corresponding variables or parameters are denoted by an index
B or I, respectively. The nodal position coordinates in the
interior of the net are therefore denoted by rI ∈ R3nI and the
ones at the boundary of the net are denoted by rB ∈ R3nB . The
lengths of the m cable net edges are deﬁned as the Euclidean
distances between the adjacent nodes. The length of the edge
between the nodes s and t is thus deﬁned as

l(s,t) := krs − rtk2.
(7)
We denote the parameter of unstressed length of the edge i by
l0,i. The edges in the interior of the net are of ﬁxed unstressed
lengths. These parameters are stacked in the vector

l0,I := [l0,1, ..., l0,mI ]⊤ ∈ RmI .
(8)
The boundary edges of the cable net are attached to the rigid
frame via turnbuckles. The latter provide some degrees of free-
dom to apply control inputs in the form of adjustments of the
unstressed edge lengths. The control inputs can be applied in
order to change the form of the cable net. The parameters of un-
stressed lengths of the boundary edges are stacked in the vector
l0,B := [l0,mI+1, ..., l0,m]⊤ ∈ RmB , with m = mI + mB. The
parameter vector containing the unstressed lengths of all cable
net edges is deﬁned as

l0 := [l⊤

3.2 Force Balance Equations

The static equilibrium of the cable net can be characterized by
the nodal coordinates r for which the net forces at all interior
nodes are zero, i.e., given by the solution of the equations

for all interior nodes s ∈ VI and for all tensioned edges (s, t)
which are adjacent to node s, denoted by ¯Es. The material
parameter EA(s,t) represents the elasticity of the edge (s, t).
For ﬁxed boundary values, rB, the implicit function h : R3nI ×
RmB 7→ R3nI , with h(rI , l0,I) = 0, is the vector containing
the force equilibrium equations in x-, y- and z-directions for all
interior nodes, i.e.,

3.3 Problem Formulation

Prior work has identiﬁed the unstressed edge lengths l0 as the
parameters with the largest uncertainties and biggest inﬂuence
on the cable net form. As the cable net is constructed in a ten-
sioned state, these lengths cannot accurately be measured. We
make the following assumptions about the system. The bound-
ary positions, rB, at the rigid frame are known and constant,
i.e., the frame does not ﬂex or bend for changing edge lengths
parameters. Since the unstressed lengths of the boundary edges,
l0,B, are actuated, their desired values can be precisely conﬁg-
ured. Therefore, their values are known and constant. In con-
trast, the nominal (desired) values of the unstressed lengths of
the interior edges, l0,I , are subject to fabrication variations and
are non-adjustable and therefore cannot be precisely achieved
on the as-built system. Furthermore, the parameters l0,I also
cannot be directly measured on the system and are therefore
uncertain. They however have a big inﬂuence on the form of
the cable net and thus on the performance of model-based
control methods, and therefore need to be precisely identiﬁed.
In order to reduce the time and cost on the construction site, the
number of measurements needed for the identiﬁcation should
be minimized.

Given the constant boundary position coordinates, rB, and the
constant boundary edge lengths, l0,B, and given the nonlinear
implicit equations characterizing the static equilibrium form of
the cable net from (10), hs(l0,I , rI ) = 0, ∀s ∈ VI , the function
f : R3nI → RmI ,
rI 7→ l0,I ,
mapping the position coordinates of the interior nodes, rI ,
into the parameters l0,I , is to be found. Then, one set of
measurements of rI is sufﬁcient to identify the parameters l0,I .
As the function f is not analytically known, we use nonlinear
regression to learn it. This procedure is discussed in the sequel.

(12)

4. GAUSSIAN PROCESSES FOR CABLE NET
PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION

In this section, we present the learning procedure for the latent
function f. Using the learned function, denoted here by ˆf, and
a single set of measurements of rI , denoted by ˆrI , we identify
the parameters l0,I of the cable net by evaluating ˆl0,I = ˆf(rI ).

4.1 Learning Procedure

According to (12), for each interior edge i ∈ EI , one can deﬁne
the function fi as the ith coordinate of f. More precisely, we can
deﬁne functions

fi : R3nI → R,

∀i ∈ EI ,

such that

f(rI ) := [f1(rI ), · · · , fmI (rI )]

T

= l0,I.

Remark 1. One can show that the function f exists under certain
conditions.

The latent function, f, can be learned by learning each of its
coordinates, fi, i = 1, . . . , mI , using an appropriate nonlinear
regression method. The approach used here is the Gaussian
process regression introduced in Section 2.2. Toward this, we
need a suitable kernel or covariance function as well as a set
of training data. Regarding the kernel, we employ square expo-
nential kernels introduced in (5). Note that here d equals 3nI.
In particular, we choose isotropic square exponential kernels,
i.e., we assume that Λ = λ2Id and subsequently, for any pair of
x1 and x2, we have

k(x1, x2) = σ2

f exp(−

λ2
2

kx1 − x2k2).

(15)

This choice is validated by the numerical experiments in Sec-
tion 5. Accordingly, the hyperparameters of the model are λ,
σf . In order to estimate the hyperparameters, we use like-
lihood maximization or equivalently negative log-likelihood
minimization which are non-convex optimization problems (see
Section 2.4). The kernel being isotropic simpliﬁes the optimiza-
tion problem and also helps to avoid spurious local minima
during the negative log-likelihood minimization. In addition to
kernel selection and hyperparameter estimation, we also need
suitable training data. More precisely, we need a set of data
denoted by D = {(rI (κ), l0,I (κ)) | κ = 1, ..., nD} which
comprises nD pairs of (rI , l0,I). Let us assume for the moment
that we have access to such a data set D. Then, Algorithm 1
summarizes the steps of the learning procedure described in
this section. The procedure for obtaining suitable training data
is presented in the following.

4.2 Efﬁcient Data Generation

In order to train the GP, data pairs (rI , l0,I) are required. As
measured data is very expensive, simulated data can be used
instead. The training data can easily be computed making use of
the following observation. The inverse function f−1 that maps
the parameters l0,I into the nodal coordinates rI ,

f−1 : RmI → R3nI ,
l0,I 7→ rI ,

(16)

can be reformulated as a second-order cone program and thus
be evaluated by convex programming, as presented in (St¨urz
et al., 2016a), (St¨urz et al., 2019). This is true for ﬁxed pa-
rameters l0,I , rB and l0,B, and for all edges being in tension.
Under the assumption that the frame does not ﬂex or bend, the
position coordinates of the boundary nodes, rB, can be assumed
to be constant. They can be measured precisely on the construc-
tion site, and are therefore known (St¨urz et al., 2019), (Liew
et al., 2018). As discussed before, the unstressed boundary edge
length parameters, l0,B, can precisely be actuated to the desired
value and are therefore also known. The parameters l0,I will
be randomly chosen for the data generation. The underlying
second-order cone program that needs to be solved is brieﬂy
presented in the following.

In order to ﬁnd the static equilibrium of the system in terms
of the coordinates rI , for given parameters l0,I , the approach
of minimizing the total energy of the cable net can be taken.
We assume that the elastic tension forces versus elongation
function of the edges are linear and increasing. Then, for ﬁxed
parameters l0,I , l0,B and rB the problem of minimizing the
total energy of the system is equivalent to the following convex
second-order cone program (SOCP) (St¨urz et al., 2016a)

where the vector q ∈ Rm and the variable v ∈ R are introduced
in order to formulate the problem as an SOCP. For details about
this problem formulation we refer to St¨urz et al. (2019).

In order to generate the data set D = {(rI (κ), l0,I (κ)) | κ =
1, ..., nD}, a set of nD parameter vectors of unstressed interior
edge lengths, l0,I, are randomly generated as

for k = 1, ..., nD.

l0I (κ) = ¯l0,I + ∆l0,I(κ),

(18)
In (18), ¯l0,I is the vector of nominal parameters designed to
achieve the desired geometry of the cable net, and ∆l0,I (κ)
are the realized uncertainty vectors, e.g., drawn from a uniform
distribution. In order to compute the corresponding position
coordinates of the interior nodes, rI (κ), representing a static
equilibrium of the cable net for the given parameters l0,I(κ),
the inverse function f−1(l0,I (κ)) as in (16) can efﬁciently be
evaluated by solving the SOCP in (17). The steps of the data
generation are summarized in Algorithm 2.

4.3 Parameter Identiﬁcation Based on Trained GP

After generating the data set D as in Algorithm 2 and training
the GP to learn the function ˆf as in Algorithm 1, we are ready
for the parameter identiﬁcation of the unstressed interior edge
lengths l0,I . On the construction site, the values of rI can be
measured in a very accurate way (St¨urz et al., 2019), (Liew
et al., 2018). Based on one measurement of the interior nodal
coordinates of the cable net, which we denote by rmeas
in the
following, the parameter identiﬁcation of l0,I is then given by
ˆl0,I := ˆf(rmeas

5. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

We present numerical results on a cable net formwork for
the construction of a doubly curved lightweight roof structure,
inspired by a quarter-scale prototype of the HiLo roof on the
NEST building at the EMPA campus in D¨ubendorf, Switzerland
(Block, P. and Schlueter, A., et al., 2017). The prototype model
has mI = 536 interior edges, and thus l0,I ∈ R536. The number
of interior nodes is nI = 300, and therefore rI ∈ R900. More
details about the prototype are given in (St¨urz et al., 2019).
Figure 2 shows a plot of the cable net. The nominal values of
the unstressed edge lengths l0,B and ¯l0,I are known. They result
from a design problem to match the desired target form of the
cable net. While the boundary edge lengths l0,B are adjustable,
and can therefore be precisely set during the installation of
the cable net system, the interior unstressed edge lengths l0,I
are not adjustable. We assume that the true parameters l0,I lie
within ±5 mm of their nominal values ¯l0,I.
In the following, instead of identifying the whole parameter
vector l0,I as presented before, we identify the uncertainty
∆l0,I . In addition to the nominal parameters, ¯l0,I , and the
true parameters l0,I , as in (18), we further deﬁne the predicted
parameters, ˆl0,I , as

ˆl0,I := ¯l0,I + ∆ˆl0,I .
(20)
For ﬁxed parameters rB and l0,B, let us deﬁne the nominal form
¯rI , the true form rI , and the predicted form ˆrI , which are the
solutions to the SOCP in (17) for the corresponding parameters
¯l0,I , l0,I, and ˆl0,I, respectively. We further deﬁne the following
deviations from the nominal form

With these deﬁnitions, the function that is learned in Algo-
rithm 1 is f : ∆rI 7→ ∆l0,I .

A set of nD = 1000 data pairs (∆rI , ∆l0,I ) is generated using
Algorithm 2 in Section 4.2. The realized uncertainty vectors
are randomly generated, drawn from a uniform distribution of
±5 mm, i.e., ∆l0,I (κ) ∈ U(−0.005, 0.005). We divide the data
set into nD = 950 data pairs that will be used for the training
of the GP, and nv = 50 data pairs that will be used for cross-
validation. The GP is then trained as presented in Algorithm 1
in Section 4.1 to learn the function f : ∆rI 7→ ∆l0,I .

Each of the nv points ∆rI (κ), κ = 1, ..., nv from the validation
data set is then used to represent a measurement of the deviation
between the true cable net form and the nominal one. For
each of the points ∆rI (κ) the parameter vector ∆ˆl0,I (κ) is
identiﬁed via equation (19). The predicted values ∆ˆl0,I (κ) are
then compared to the true realized deviations ∆l0,I (κ) from the
validation data set. The prediction error for the uncertainty of
the unstressed length of edge i of data point κ is deﬁned as
ei(κ) := ∆l0,i(κ) − ∆ˆl0,i(κ),

κ = 1, ..., nv. (22)

i ∈ Ei,

Figure 3 shows the values of ∆l0,i(κ), ∆ˆl0,i(κ) and ei(κ) over
all interior edges i = 1, ..., mI = 536 for one randomly chosen
data pair (∆rI (κ), ∆l0,I (κ)), with κ randomly ﬁxed to κ = 1.

In Figure 4, we present statistical results for the prediction
error ei over all interior edges i = 1, ..., mI considering
all κ = 1, ...nv = 50 validation data points. The mean of the
prediction error ei over all the nv data points of the validation
data set is given by

mean(ei) :=

Note that the data in Figure 4 is plotted on a scale of the y-axis
of one order of magnitude smaller than the one in Figure 3.

For further statistical evaluation of the cross-validation, let us
deﬁne the prediction error vector for all parameter uncertainties
of the interior edge lengths as

∆rI := rI − ¯rI ,

∆ˆrI := ˆrI − ¯rI .

In the following, we illustrate the importance of the parameter
identiﬁcation in terms of the impact of the parameter uncer-
tainty ∆l0,I on the accuracy of the cable net model form rI .
For demonstration purposes, we focus again on one speciﬁc
data pair from the validation set, and we choose the one that
has been used before in Figure 3, i.e., κ = 1.

in (28), between the forms resulting from the nominal
and true parameters, ¯l0,I and l0,I , (left), and between the
predicted and true parameters, ˆl0,I and l0,I , (right).

We compare the deviations between the forms ¯rI and rI (nom-
inal, i.e., from the model without identiﬁcation, and true), and
between ˆrI and rI (predicted, i.e., from the model with identiﬁ-
cation, and true). We deﬁne the errors er,nom and er,ident as the
vectors of Euclidean distances between the respective position
coordinates of the interior nodes i = 1, ..., nI , i.e., for each i
the entries of the vectors er,nom and er,ident are deﬁned as

er,nom
i

er,ident

:= kri − ˆrik2.

Table 1 gives some characteristic distances between these
forms, where RMSE stands for the root mean squared error.
Figure 5 shows these distances over the cable net, i.e., the
corresponding entries of the vectors er,nom and er,ident are
shown over the respective nodes. This shows the inﬂuence of
the uncertainty ∆l0,I on the cable net form and therefore the
importance of the precise identiﬁcation of ∆ˆl0,I . In particular,
the latter has a big impact on the performance of model-based
control methods for adjusting the cable net form to minimize
deviations from the designed target form (St¨urz et al., 2019).

6. CONCLUSION

This paper presents a novel identiﬁcation method for important
uncertain parameters of a tensioned cable net system, which can
be used as a formwork for efﬁcient lightweight construction.
The parameter identiﬁcation method is based on GP regression.
We formulate the function from the form of the cable net
to the model parameters and leverage the convexity of the
inverse function in order to efﬁciently generate training data in
simulation. The impact of the precise parameter identiﬁcation
on the precision of the model-based form of the cable net has
been illustrated in numerical experiments.
