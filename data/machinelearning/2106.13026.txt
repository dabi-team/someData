ABSTRACT
We present our 500 pc distance-limited study of stellar ﬂares using the Dark Energy
Camera as part of the Deeper, Wider, Faster Program. The data was collected via
continuous 20-second cadence g band imaging and we identify 19,914 sources with
precise distances from Gaia DR2 within twelve, ∼3 square-degree, ﬁelds over a range
of Galactic latitudes. An average of ∼74 minutes is spent on each ﬁeld per visit. All
light curves were accessed through a novel unsupervised machine learning technique
designed for anomaly detection. We identify 96 ﬂare events occurring across 80 stars,
the majority of which are M dwarfs. Integrated ﬂare energies range from ∼ 1031 –
1037 erg, with a proportional relationship existing between increased ﬂare energy with
increased distance from the Galactic plane, representative of stellar age leading to
declining yet more energetic ﬂare events. In agreement with previous studies we observe
an increase in ﬂaring fraction from M0 – M6 spectral types. Furthermore, we ﬁnd a
decrease in the ﬂaring fraction of stars as vertical distance from the galactic plane is
increased, with a steep decline present around ∼100 pc. We ﬁnd that ∼70% of identiﬁed
ﬂares occur on short timescales of < 8 minutes. Finally we present our associated ﬂare
rates, ﬁnding a volumetric rate of 2.9 ± 0.3 × 10

1 INTRODUCTION

Stellar ﬂares occur stochastically across main sequence stars,
commonly seen in those with with large convective en-
velopes, and result from violent reconnection of magnetic
ﬁeld lines (Haisch et al. 1991; Pettersen 1989; Lacy et al.
1976). This sudden release of magnetic energy into the sur-

rounding stellar atmosphere causes rapid dissipation of chro-
mospheric and coronal ﬁeld and sheet aligned currents, gen-
erating strong emission seen in the radio through to X-ray,
with the largest emission occurring within the UV contin-
uum (Osten et al. 2005; Hawley & Pettersen 1991; Lin &
Hudson 1976; Berger et al. 2008). To date, stellar ﬂares have
been found to occur across a vast range of energies, span-
ning from nanoﬂares of 1023 erg recorded from our own Sun
by Parnell & Jupp (2000), to superﬂares releasing upwards
of ∼ 1033–1036 erg as discovered by Maehara et al. (2012)

within the data from The Kepler Space Telescope (Borucki
et al. 2010, Kepler hereafter). The ﬂare frequency distribu-
tion as a function of integrated ﬂare energy is a power law
with higher energy ﬂares being less likely (Pettersen 1989;
Ishida et al. 1991; Shibayama et al. 2013; Chang et al. 2015).
Bopp & Moﬀett (1973) ﬁrst identiﬁed two apparent pop-
ulations of ﬂares, classical and complex, based on their tem-
poral structure, dividing them by number of peaks present,
with classical ﬂares only exhibiting one peak and complex
ﬂares having multiple peaks (see also Moﬀett 1974). Classi-
ﬁcation may be limited by survey cadence, where low tem-
poral resolution of the ﬂare event is observed. More recently
Dal & Evren (2010) further identiﬁed sub-populations of fast
and slow ﬂares from the ratio of rise to decay time, with ra-
tios of < 3.5 identiﬁed as slow and > 3.5 as fast. Work by
Hawley et al. (2014) showed for M-dwarfs, complex ﬂares not
only have longer durations on average but also dominate the
larger energy ranges seen in their sample from Kepler. This
correlation between complex events and longer decay times
suggests the possibility of there only being two populations,
being classical/fast and complex/slow. The historical clas-
siﬁcation into four populations may be due to past survey
cadences and target selections. However the fast cadenced,
continual imaging required to deﬁnitively test this correla-
tion has only been achieved by few studies to date, with
majority targeting speciﬁc objects for other science goals.

Stellar ﬂares are most commonly generated by low mass
stars. These cooler stars have larger convective envelopes
surrounding their radiative cores, with theoretical models
showing a star’s structure transitioning into a fully convec-
tive regime at a stellar mass of ∼ 0.3M⊙ (Dorman et al.
1989; Chabrier & Baraﬀe 1997; Morales et al. 2009). This
eﬀect plays a part in the observed M4 transition, where stel-
lar activity increases dramatically between M3–M5 stellar
types. Stellar activity from these stars produces ﬂares with
hot (blue) thermal components, providing a photometrically
dramatic contrast against their cool red photosphere (West
& Hawley 2008; Hilton et al. 2010; Pineda et al. 2013). This
dramatic contrast in thermal energy allows for easier detec-
tion, in comparison to ﬂares of similar energy releases from
hotter (bluer) stars.

Several studies into ﬂare properties have taken advan-
tage of M dwarf properties to further understand ﬂare activ-
ity as a function of age, duty cycles, ﬂare rate as functions
of Galactic latitude, rotation period, and light-curve shape
(Hawley & Pettersen 1991; Kowalski et al. 2009; Hilton et al.
2010; Pineda et al. 2013; Maehara et al. 2012; Schmidt et al.
2018; G¨unther et al. 2019; Davenport et al. 2012; Daven-
port 2016)). Notably, work by Kowalski et al. (2009) exam-
ined ∼50,000 light curves from 10,497 M-dwarfs, collected
via the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) of Stripe 82. Kowal-
ski et al. (2009) found a strong relationship between ﬂaring
stars and those stars which have strong Hα emission during
quiescence, with the large majority of ﬂare events occurring
on late type (and younger) M-dwarfs of subtype M4-M6.
Kowalski et al. (2009) also conﬁrmed that there was a trend
towards higher energetic ﬂares occurring on the relatively in-
active higher mass stars, M0-M1. These results were veriﬁed
by Hilton et al. (2010) using the SDSS low-mass star spectro-
scopic sample of ∼38,000 M dwarfs from West et al. (2008)
to identify a further 63 ﬂares. Duty cycles of these ﬂares
show a large increase with spectral subtype, increasing from

0.02% to 3% for early and late M-dwarfs respectively. The
SDSS photometric and spectroscopic samples were also used
to explore the relationship between ﬂare rate and Galactic
latitude, both ﬁnding that nearly all ﬂares in their respec-
tive samples occurred near the Galactic plane, indicating the
younger, later type M-dwarfs, are more predominant within
stellar populations of the plane (Kowalski et al. 2009; Hilton
et al. 2010). Later work on SDSS DR7 M-dwarf magnetic
activity by Pineda et al. (2013) further conﬁrmed that the
active ﬂare fraction decreases with greater radial distances
from the Galactic centre due to stellar age.

The space-based Kepler survey has provided the largest
ﬂare catalogs to date, primarily exploring ﬂare activity
across solar-like stars during the original mission (Walkowicz
et al. 2011; Hawley et al. 2014; Davenport 2016; Van Doors-
selaere et al. 2017; Yang & Liu 2019). While the modiﬁed
observing strategy implemented during K2 (the 2nd Kepler
mission created due to the failure of reaction mechanisms)
allowed for the study of 134 and 540 bright M dwarfs by
(Stelzer et al. 2016) and Yang et al. (2017) respectively. More
recently, with the launch of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS; Ricker et al. 2009), G¨unther et al. (2019)
uncovered a further 673 ﬂaring M dwarfs via the 2-minute
cadence data. Several ground based surveys, including the
Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS; Wheatley et al.
2018), EVRYSCOPE (Law et al. 2014), All-Sky Automated
Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2012) have
also produced detailed ﬂare catalogs for bright nearby stars
(Howard et al. 2018; Jackman et al. 2018; Dillon et al. 2020;
Rodr´ıguez Mart´ınez et al. 2020a). The recent work by Chang
et al. (2020) investigates M dwarf ﬂare activity across the
southern sky using the SkyMapper Southern Survey DR1.
Chang et al. (2020) and ﬁnd 254 ﬂare events and a steep
decline in ﬂaring fraction towards larger vertical distances
from the Galactic plane.

The Deeper, Wider, Faster program (DWF; Cooke et al.
in prep) commenced in 2014 and has targeted several ﬁelds
with deep, fast 20-second cadenced optical imaging, which
provides a unique opportunity to study ﬂares over tempo-
rally resolved time frames. Here we present the ﬁndings of
a 500 pc distance limited ﬂare study across 12 DWF ﬁelds.
Section 2 describes the DWF program and optical data col-
lection. Section 3 outlines our analysis and methodology for
ﬂare identiﬁcation and the calculation of ﬂare characteris-
tics. The results and discussion are presented in Section 4,
and conclusions are provided in Section 5.

We describe the DWF program, the targeted ﬁelds and the
criteria used when choosing them in Section 2.2, and the
nature of our fast cadenced, deep optical imaging in Section
2.3.

2.1 The Deeper, Wider, Faster Program

Several classes of fast (millisecond-to-hours duration) opti-
cal transient events have been discovered over the last few
decades and the progenitors and physical mechanisms be-
hind many of them are still relatively poorly known (e.g.,

supernovae shock breakouts and other rapidly evolving ex-
tragalatic events, see Garnavich et al. 2016; Prentice et al.
2018; Perley et al. 2018). What has limited our ability to
detect and understand these events has been the capability
to gather deep data in short, regular time intervals before,
during and after the events as well as over a range of wave-
i.e., deep, wide-ﬁeld, fast-cadenced non-targeted
lengths,
surveys. The DWF has been designed with these challenges
speciﬁcally in mind, constructing a multi-wavelength and
simultaneous observational program of over 80 facilities to
date1. DWF takes a ‘proactive’ approach to transient astron-
omy, with multi-wavelength observations of the target ﬁelds
taken continuously over 1-3 hour periods, typically over 6
consecutive days, acquiring data before, during and after
transient events. From our real time processing we are able
to rapidly identify candidates and coordinate rapid and long-
term follow-up observations. DWF was ﬁrst created in 2014
and since its inception has had two commissioning runs and
eight operational runs (see Andreoni & Cooke (2018), Cooke
et al., in prep).

The unique design of DWF allows exploration of tran-
sients on millisecond-to-hours timescales, providing further
understanding into the classes of already observed fast tran-
sient events as well as exploring events theorised to occur on
these timescales. The optical component of DWF is able to
explore a region of parameter space not yet reached by pre-
vious ground based transient surveys, by taking continuous,
high cadenced 20 second exposures, imaging with the wide-
ﬁeld sensitive Dark Energy Camera (DECam, FOV=3 deg2
Flaugher et al. 2015) on the 4m Blanco telescope in Chile,
or continuous 30 second exposures using the Hyper Suprime
Cam (HSC, FOV=1.8 deg2 Furusawa et al. 2018; Komiyama
et al. 2018; Kawanomoto et al. 2018; Miyazaki et al. 2018)
on the the 8m Subaru telescope in Hawaii. Note: this work
will only focus on the data gathered from DECam. Here, we
present ﬁndings from our in-depth analysis of stellar ﬂares
discovered in the post-run archival DECam data processing.

2.2 DWF ﬁelds used

In this work we use a total of 12 DWF ﬁelds, each visited
multiple times between the years 2015–2018, as shown in
Table 1. The total time visited on each ﬁeld varied, averaging
6.30 hours collected over several nights. A total of 75.08
hours of observations are analysed in this work.

The ongoing DWF program has targeted over 20 dis-
tinct ﬁelds, with several having repeat visits. Due to the
nature of DWF, targeted ﬁelds need to have simultane-
ous visibility by Chilean facilities (DECam, Gemini, VLT,
etc), as well as Australian or South African radio telescopes
(ASKAP, Parkes, Molonglo, MWA, MeerKAT), Antarctic
telescopes (South Pole Telescope, AST3-2), and space-based
facilities, as well as the growing number of other simulta-
neous and follow-up facilities (more detail can be found in
Cooke et al., in prep). The ﬁelds are selected using several
criteria, mainly, (1) sky position, enabling common visibil-
ity for the multiwavelength telescopes to simultaneously ob-
serve during runs scheduled at diﬀerent times of the year, (2)
preference towards low-redshift galaxy clusters/groupings or
globular clusters, (3) legacy ﬁelds with multiwavelength pre-
imaging, and (4) ﬁelds with previously detected Fast Radio
Bursts (FRBs) and FRB repeaters, as well as the need for
regions of low Galactic extinction for certain wavelength fa-
cilities. As a result, the ﬁelds targeted are somewhat arbi-
trarily distributed across the sky, providing data across a
variety of Galactic declinations.

2.3 DECam fast-cadence Imaging

The imaging data were collected over multiple DWF runs
using DECam. During a DWF run, continuous 20-second
g band exposures are taken across multiple target ﬁelds.
The use of the g band ﬁlter maximizes the depth of our
imaging, reaching ∼0.5 magnitudes deeper in comparison to
the other ﬁlters in dark time. The expected limiting mag-
nitude in g band is m(AB) ∼ 23, for an average seeing of
1.0 arc-seconds and airmass of 1.5 (relatively high airmass
due to the ﬁeld constraints of observing simultaneously with
multiple facilities). All images used in this work were post-
processed through the NOAO High-Performance Pipeline
System (Valdes & Swaters 2007; Swaters & Valdes 2007;

4

S. Webb et al.

Scott et al. 2007), and transferred to the OzSTAR super-
computer at Swinburne University of Technology. We pro-
cessed each of the 62 CCDs in parallel, performing source
extraction via SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), zero-
point corrections and magnitude oﬀset corrections against
the SkyMapper DR2 catalog (Bertin & Arnouts 2010; Onken
et al. 2019). A master list was compiled by cross-matching
the position of all extracted sources from each CCD, over all
exposures within an 0.5 arcsec radius between source cen-
troids, producing one catalog of unique source positions per
ﬁeld. We used this master catalog for reference when select-
ing our volume limited sample, as explained in detail in the
following section.

2.4 Volume Limited Star Selection

In this paper we explore ﬂare activity out to 500 pc across
each of our 12 ﬁelds covering a total sky area of ∼36 square
degrees and volume of ∼443,000 pc3. Distances to the stars
were provided by the Gaia DR2 parallaxes to pre-select our
sample (Luri et al. 2018; Evans et al. 2018). For each ﬁeld,
we queried Gaia DR2 using Vizier2, selecting only sources
that meet the following criteria:

• 1000/Parallax(mas) ≤ 500 pc
• ∆ Parallax/Parallax (mas) ≤ 0.2
• G Magnitude ≥ 11

It should be noted that due to the systematic implicit biases
associated with measuring parallaxes our sample of stars are
more likely to be on the higher end of their associated dis-
tance ± error (as described by Trumpler & Weaver 1953). We
choose to apply a magnitude limit cut to avoid sources likely
to saturate from our DECam observations. Each Gaia source
catalog was cross-matched against each ﬁeld’s master source
catalog, with light curve ﬁles generated for each source ex-
isting in our DWF data. Finally, only light curves with 3
or more consecutive detections during a single night’s visit
were evaluated for ﬂares (possibly excluding ﬂares shorter
than 40 seconds). Table 1 outlines each of our target ﬁelds,
and the number of Gaia selected sources. A total of 19,914
sources were assessed. Separate light curves were generated
for each source over each night of observations. The total
number of light curves in the sample is 114,958.

3 ANALYSIS

3.1 Flare Identiﬁcation

3.1.1 Anomaly Ranking Visual Inspection - candidate

ﬂagging

To identify ﬂares within our sample, we ﬁrst use unsuper-
vised machine leaning to rank light curves from most to least
anomalous, as detailed in full in Webb et al. (2020). A set of
25 features was extracted for each light curve in our sample.
The features and light curves were then fed into the python
based Astronomaly package (Lochner & Bassett 2020). As-
tronomaly consists of a python back end and JavaScript
front end to easily explore the data via a locally hosted web

interface. We pass the light curve features through the scikit-
learn implementation of isolation forest within Astronomaly
to determine the most anomalous sources (Ting et al. 2008).
We visually inspect all light curves through the Astronomaly
GUI, shown in order of anomaly ranking (as measured by
the isolation forest algorithm). All light curves with poten-
tial ﬂares are ﬂagged for further evaluation. We reduce the
original 114,958 light curves to just ∼700 during this pro-
cess by removing static stars using HDBSCAN clustering
(for details see Webb et al. 2020).

3.1.2 Flare detection and criteria

The ﬂagged light curves were then passed through a Change
Point Analysis (CPA) algorithm to ﬂag the start and ﬁn-
ish positions of individual ﬂares within the light curve. We
use the method as ﬁrst outlined by Chang et al. (2015) to
develop a ﬂexible CPA algorithm, modiﬁed to suit our fast
cadenced data. CPA is useful in identifying abrupt variations
in sequential data and is done so by combining a cumula-

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2021)

tive sum scheme and bootstrap rank statistics to ﬂag points
of systematic change within sequential data. Our adaption
of Chang et al. (2015) FINDﬂare algorithm is used to ﬂag
all possible ﬂares within our shortlisted light curves. The
criteria used within the FINDﬂare algorithm are as follows,
N1: The required number of standard deviations above the
median for the data points, N2: The number of standard de-
viation plus uncertainty above the median, N3: The number
of consecutive points required to meet the above criteria to
be ﬂagged as a ﬂare. We choose to use the values N1=3,
N2=2, N3=3, after sensitivity testing on known DWF ﬂares
identiﬁed from previous work by Andreoni et al. (2020) and
Webb et al. (2020). We then estimate the quiescent mag-
nitude of each source by taking the median magnitude of
all data points before the ﬂare (and in very rare cases of
ﬂares at the beginning of the observations, after the ﬂare).
We then determine the standard deviation, σ, of the quies-
cent section of the light curve, and as set with the N3 value,
require at least three consecutive data points to be greater
then the two standard deviations above the median magni-
tude, see Figure 1 for example. All light curves which passed
these criteria were manually inspected alongside their image
cutouts for each exposure. This stage of careful image evalu-
ation allowed the rejection of candidates which where caused
due to observational eﬀects (e.g. cosmic rays, hot pixels, edge
detections).

3.2 Flare Characteristics

For each ﬂare in our sample we record several characteristics
of the event. These include, duration, maximum change in
magnitude (∆M), ﬂare type and Equivalent duration..

The duration of the ﬂare is measured from the last ob-
served quiescent point. The ﬁrst data point, of 2 consecutive
data points, to fall below the upper 1 sigma uncertainty to
the mean quiescent magnitude, two examples can be seen
in panel (a) of Figure 2. In the rare event of our observa-
tions ﬁnishing before the ﬂare reaches the star’s quiescent
magnitude, the duration is a minimum limit and marked
accordingly in Table A and an example can be seen in panel
(b) of Figure 2.

The ∆M of each ﬂare is calculated by the diﬀerence be-
tween the peak magnitude recorded and the median quies-
cent magnitude for each source. Here it is important to note
that these measurements can underestimate the true value
of ∆M which could occur during the 20–30 second readout
after each exposure and diluted by the 20 second exposure
itself. This is more likely for the short duration ﬂares. Fig-
ure 1 demonstrates both longer duration (a) and short du-
ration ﬂares (b). These characteristics are recorded further
in Table A.

3.3 Integrated Flare Energy

The integrated ﬂare energy represents the total amount of
energy released over the duration of the ﬂare. To calculate
the total integrated ﬂare energy we ﬁrst calculate the g band
component from our observations.

To estimate total energy in g band, each light curve
was normalised by setting the star’s quiescent ﬂux to one,
creating a relative output for each data point. Using the

Figure 2. Panel (a): Flare star example illustrating the maxi-
mum magnitude change and total event duration deﬁnitions. The
maximum change in magnitude is determined by the diﬀerence
between the peak ﬂare detection and the median quiescent mag-
nitude (green line; see deﬁnition of the quiescent mag described
in section 3.1.2). The total duration of the event is measured from
the last detection of a quiescence magnitude before the ﬂare, to
the point at which the ﬂare re-enters within 1 σ of the mean
quiescent magnitude range (red lines). Panel (b) a ﬂare event

relative outputs over the duration of the ﬂare, we sum the
total excess amount of ﬂux generated by the ﬂare event, ∑
rel.
Figure 3 demonstrates a ﬂare’s excess ﬂux for each point
(relative intensity >1). We use the Riemann sum binning
method across all points. For each ﬂare we ﬁrst derived the
relative intensity for each point in the light curve from the
magnitudes with the following:

where I0+ f and I0 are the intensity values of the ﬂaring and
the quiescent stellar surfaces in the observed g band. Note,
this method may underestimate the true local ﬂux by a small
amount small spikes in ﬂux after reaching the quiescent level
threshold are not included. For each detection of the ﬂare,
the relative intensity is integrated over the ﬂare duration to

where d is distance to star,. Finally the total integrated g
band ﬂare energy is calculated by multiplying the relative
ﬂare energy by the quiescent stellar ﬂux and the duration of
the ﬂare:

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In our sample of 19,914 stars, we identiﬁed a total of 96
ﬂares, from 80 individual stars, within our DWF 500 pc dis-
tance limited sample. We breakdown our ﬂare results across
source spectral type, Galactic latitude, stellar age and ﬂare
duration. We further explore the Flare Frequency Distribu-
tion (FFD) of our sample, and present our ﬂare rate calcu-
lations.

4.1 Spectral Types

where t is duration of the ﬂare in seconds.

To estimate the total integrated ﬂux across all wave-
lengths of the ﬂare we modeled the expected blackbody
emission for a typical ﬂare. Flare temperatures have been
found to vary dramatically across similar spectral types and
energy ranges. Commonly, the combined line and contin-
uum emission of ﬂares has been approximated by a ∼9,000
K blackbody (Osten & Wolk 2015). However recent work
by Howard et al. (2020) found that across 42 K5–K5 super-
ﬂares, 43% of ﬂares emit temperatures above 14,000 K. In
this work will assume a likely ﬂare temperature of 9000 K.
To calculate the overall contribution of the g band ﬂux
emission, we produce a Planck function for T = 9000K and
compute the ratio of radiance over the DECam g-band width
(400–560nm), taking into account the relative transmission
across the ﬁlter, and compare it to the full emission, see
Figure 4. From this we ﬁnd that the total emission across
our g band accounts for 10.9% of the total energy released.
We therefore multiply the E f (gband) by 9.2 to account for the
full bolometric energy (E f (bol)).

resources/imaging-calibrations/ﬂuxmagnitude-conversion

Using Gaia G magnitudes and BP-RP colour information,
we identiﬁed the likely spectral type for each source in our
sample, identifying that this work primarily explores G – M6
spectral types. Flaring sources were identiﬁed across the K
to M6 range, with the majority occurring across the M2–M5
range (Figure 5). Figure 6 (a) shows the number of stars as
a function of spectral type in our 500 pc sample and those
which ﬂared, and (b) presents the ﬂaring fraction for each
of the binned spectral types. We ﬁnd an increase in ﬂaring
fraction across the M dwarfs, with it peaking in our sample
at ∼ 14% for M6. Although the overall ﬂaring fractions are
moderately lower then previous work (∼ 30% lower for M5),
we still observe a steep increase from M4 onward, coinciding
with where it is thought M dwarfs become fully convective
(Kowalski et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2017; Mondrik et al. 2019;
G¨unther et al. 2019; Rodr´ıguez Mart´ınez et al. 2020b).

Our lower ﬂaring fractions may be due to limitations
on continuous time on target ﬁelds, with an average of ∼74
minutes on ﬁeld per night. We speculate that we are unable
to observe the full range of classical longer duration ﬂares
(e.g. Hawley et al. 2014; G¨unther et al. 2019), through our
observation strategy and selection criteria (e.g. the ﬂare peak
must be within the data). As discussed in more detail in
Section 4.5, our ﬂare sample predominately contains shorter
duration events.

sources across our sample, simulated sample and speciﬁcally ﬂares (Robin et al. 2012).

et al. (2019). Panel b): Percentage of ﬂaring sources versus spectral type, with the spectral type determined in the same manner as the

Using the likely spectral types from Figure 5, we in-
vestigated the colour-colour temperature relationship pre-
viously presented in (Schmidt et al. 2016). We use the All
WISE (Cutri et al. 2021) W1 (3.35um) and W2 (4.6um)
bands to calculate (W1 − W2). To calculate (r-z) we used

the Skymapper DR3 (Wolf et al. 2018; Onken et al. 2019)
and z band observations for each of our ﬂaring sources. Both
(W1 − W2) and (r-z) values for sources can be found in Ap-
pendix A. The resulting colour–colour plot can be seen in
Figure 7. We use the BP − RP colour temperature relation-

ship as outlined by Casagrande et al. (2020) to estimate the
eﬀective temperature (Teﬀ) for each of our ﬂaring sources,
coloured accordingly on Figure 7. For each spectral type we
calculate the median (W1 − W2) and (r-z) positions and
Teﬀ, plotted in green markers. The estimates for Teﬀ break-
down for redder sources and are not reliable for sources with
(BP − RP) > 2.5. Those spectral types which have untrust-
worthy temperature estimates are presented by red markers.
We expand the initial temperature relationship presented by
(Schmidt et al. 2016), probing to the M3 range, however are
unable to present reliable temperature colour relationships
for M4–M6 range.

4.2 Flare Energies

Figure 8 shows ﬂare duration versus integrated ﬂare energy
for our sample of ﬂares alongside additional ﬂare samples
from various surveys. We identify a population of low en-
ergy ﬂares, bridging the gap between X class solar ﬂares
(∼ 1031 ergs) and the majority of stellar ﬂares as cataloged
by Kepler and GALEX (∼ 1035 ergs). These low energy ﬂares
have a small range in duration, occurring over ∼ 5–30 minute
periods. Interpreting the scaling relations in Figure 8 indi-
cates our sample is especially diverse, spanning magnetic
ﬁeld strengths of 60 to several hundred Gauss and active
region length scales of 109 cm to exceeding the radius of the
Sun.

Interestingly, Figure 8 also demonstrates a clear rela-
tionship between distance above the Galactic plane Z and
total ﬂare energy. Our sample appears to show ﬂares further
from the Galactic plane have larger total integrated ﬂare
energy. Total ﬂare energy also tends to be larger for longer
duration ﬂares.

We ﬁnd that the distribution of ﬂare energies is bi-
modal as shown in Figure 9, with this grouping of lower
energy ﬂares being centralised around sources (cid:46) 100 pc from
the Galactic plane. To ensure that this result was not due to
observational selection eﬀects, we took the detected ﬂares
with distances < 100pc and simulated them at increasing
distances out to 500 pc. To do this we incrementally added
100 pc to the source distances, creating four samples in the
following ranges, 100-200 pc, 200-300 pc, 300-400 pc, 400-
500 pc. To calculate the magnitudes of each source at each
simulated distance we used the following,
m = 5 × log10(d + x/d) + qmag

(5)

where m is the magnitude at the simulated distance, d is
the original distance of the ﬂaring source, x is the additional
distance added (e.g. 100 pc, 200 pc etc), and qmag is the
original quiescent magnitude of the ﬂaring source. The dif-
ference between m and qmag is calculated and subsequently
applied for each point in the original light curve and newly
associated magnitude errors were calculated. The magnitude
errors were modeled using a DECam magnitude error ver-
sus magnitude plot (for a typical night of average seeing and
airmass see Appendix B1). The simulated sample was put
through the identical ﬂare identiﬁcation pipeline, described
in Section 3.1.

We ﬁnd 95% of our <100 pc ﬂare sample were recovered,
when simulated between 100-200 pc distances. The recovery
rate continues to drop out to 500 pc, reaching 60%, see Fig-
ure 10. If we were assume the stellar population is isotropic

in our sample, we would expect to see a ∼30–40% more ﬂares
at these distances then our study observes, suggesting a drop
oﬀ of low energy ﬂares due to the young disc. Via these tests
we also conﬁrm that several lower energy ﬂares, ∼ 1031ergs
were detectable at 500 pc. However the drop in number of
low energy ﬂares past ∼100 pc in our sample suggests an
astrophysical cause, likely stellar age, further discussed in
Section 4.3.

4.3 Flares across Galactic declination

We postulate that the results discussed Section 4.2, of
densely populated ﬂares within ∼100 pc, is representative
of the dense population of stars within the thin disc of the
Milky Way. The thin disc has an estimated scale height of
200–300 pc (Cabrera-Lavers et al. 2007; Juri´c et al. 2008;
Abazajian et al. 2009) with the youngest stars concentrated
closest to the plane (Binney & Tremaine 1987). More specif-
ically it is the younger M-dwarfs which are predominant
within the stellar population of the thin disc (Kowalski et al.
2009; Hilton et al. 2010; Pineda et al. 2013).

To investigate the ﬂaring fraction as a function of the
vertical distance from the Galactic plane Z we use the dis-
tance, as calculated using the Gaia DR2 parallaxes (Luri
et al. 2018), and each ﬁeld’s central Galactic latitude to de-
termine the vertical distance from the Galactic plane. Across
our 12 ﬁelds, we probe an average distance of ∼247 pc oﬀ
the Galactic plane. Table 2 displays the maximum Z for each
ﬁeld, and the average Z for ﬂares identiﬁed in each ﬁeld. On
average the majority of ﬂares are occurring at ∼ 1/3 of the
maximum Z probed.

When combining data across all ﬁelds, we ﬁnd a strong
relationship between ﬂaring fraction and Z (normalised over
the total amount of observing hours), shown in Figure 11.
This result is in good agreement with previous studies (e.g.
Kowalski et al. 2009; Brasseur et al. 2019; Chang et al. 2020),
that also ﬁnd this relationship.

4.4 Flares from young stellar sources

Stellar ﬂare activity is known to decrease over stellar life-
times. This occurs as a star loses angular momentum, via
stellar winds, and consequently results in a quieting of the in-
ternal magnetic dynamo from decreased rotational velocity.
This age-activity relationship has previously been directly
connected with ﬂare activity (e.g. Skumanich 1972; Wright
et al. 2011; Davenport et al. 2019). Feinstein et al. (2020)
studied young K5-M5 stars, and found that ﬂare rates and
amplitudes decreased for very young stars (tage >50 Myr)
across all temperatures Teﬀ ≥ 4000 K.

We expect to ﬁnd a broad distribution with higher av-
erage transverse velocity VT across our full 500 pc sample,
typical of the well studies age-velocity relationship within
the Milky Way (Seabroke & Gilmore 2007; Rix & Bovy 2013;
Mackereth et al. 2019). However, for the ﬂare star sample
of stars with low Z positions, we expect these sources will
have lower average VT velocity, associated with a younger
age. To investigate this age-activity relationship within our
sample, we utilised Gaia DR2 proper motions to calculate
the transverse velocity (VT), in km/s, of the stars in our

spectral class is plotted with green markers. The colour-temperature relationship breaks down for sources with (BP − RP) > 2.5 and
those spectral classes eﬀected have their median position markers coloured in red. The temperature relationship presented by Schmidt
et al. (2016) is shown with black lines and labelled.

where pmRA is the proper motion measured in the right

Using VT , we can use the relationship between age and

the observed transverse velocity of stellar sources within the
Galactic thin disk.

To explore this we calculated the cumulative distribu-
tions of transverse velocities across our full 500 pc sam-
ple of sources, and ﬂaring sources, shown in Figure 12. We
ﬁnd a median VT of 35 km/s across our full 500 pc sam-
ple of sources, and a median VT of 24 km/s for the ﬂaring
sources only. When comparing the two cumulative distribu-

tions via the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, we ﬁnd a p-value of
<1 %, suggesting two distinct distributions. Using the Gaia
Universe Model Snapshot (GUMS) (Robin et al. 2012), we
model the cumulative distribution of a full simulated 500
pc sample across our 12 ﬁelds and conﬁrm that the distribu-
tions between the simulated and DWF full 500 pc are nearly
indistinguishable. We also present the cumulative distribu-
tion of isolated young sources (<0.65 Gyr) from within the
GUMS sample, which suggests a similar distribution to that
of our ﬂares.

From these results we conclude that the majority of ﬂar-
ing sources within our sample are from young stellar sources
within the thin disk.

4.5 Short Duration Flare Population

We ﬁnd a logrithmic distribution with a large duration range
for our sample, as shown in panel (a) of Figure 13. Specif-
ically, we identify that the majority of ﬂares in our sample
occur on very short timescales ((cid:46) 8 minutes). Note that the
longest duration continuous light curve is 156 minutes on
DWF ﬁeld NGC6744. The long ﬂare durations are limited
by our time on ﬁeld (see Table 1) and by the criteria and
means we use to identify ﬂares (Section 3).

This sample of short duration ﬂares contains sources
across a broad range of ﬂare amplitudes (∆M 0.1 – 1.8 mag),
as well as across the full range of distances out to 500 pc,
see pannel (b) and (c) of Figure 13. In Figure 13 (b), there
are visible vertical lines along which ﬂare durations cluster,
an artifact of our continuous 20 second observations which
cause the durations to artiﬁcially be distributed in multi-
ples of ∼50 second intervals (20 s exposures and ∼30 second
readout). It is also important to note that the true ﬂare du-
ration values were not extrapolated for the cut oﬀ ﬂares in

our sample (those with minimum duration times as a result
of the limited time on ﬁeld).

Short duration ﬂares have previously been identiﬁed
by (Brasseur et al. 2019) within the Galaxy Evolution Ex-
plorer (GALEX Bianchi & GALEX Team 1999) mission’s
10-second cadence data. The bulk of the stars observed
by GALEX were within the mid-F to mid-K spectral type
range. Our work conﬁrms that this short duration popula-
tion does indeed continue into the late-K to mid M-dwarf
stellar types, shown in Figure 13 (c).

Our sample of short duration ﬂares spans a considerable
energy range of 1031–1034 ergs, further diversifying the over-
all population of short duration ﬂares beyond the GALEX
sample. Interestingly, lower energy ﬂares (1033 erg) are not
limited to only short duration events, see Figure 7.

4.6 Flare Frequency Distribution

The Flare Frequency Distribution (FFD) represents the oc-
currence frequency (dN/dE) of ﬂares as a function of ﬂare
energy (E), and can be expressed as a power-law relation i.e.
−α. Previous work, including that on Solar ﬂares
dN/dE ∼ E
and Kepler ﬂares, ﬁnd generally α is ∼2, with slight varia-
tions in the value of α found across individual spectral types
(Shibata et al. 2013; Maehara et al. 2012; Shibayama et al.
2013; Yang et al. 2017; Yang & Liu 2019). For example, Au-
dard et al. (2000) found that the FFD became ﬂat towards
later spectral types, however Yang & Liu (2019) ﬁndings in-
dicate an increase in FFD across M dwarfs. Davenport et al.
(2019) noted that comparing stellar types using speciﬁc ﬂare
rates generated from an individual FFD implicitly assumes
that the ﬂare rate for a star is governed by a single power
law at all energies examined. This can be useful in the case
of comparing samples with diﬀerent observing conditions,
however Davenport et al. (2019) further commented that in

discovered in this work. The FFD spans the energy range of 1031to
1037. The error bar of each energy bin is calculated assuming Pois-
son statistics. The red line indicates the least-squares power law
of log(dN/dE), ﬁnding α ∼1.43 ±0.37, ﬁtted using data between
1033to 1037.

doing so we must ensure that a suﬃcient number of ﬂares
are observed in each spectral range to adequately measure
the power law distribution within the FFD. With this in
mind, we have not separated our sample to calculate FFDs
for each individual spectral types, rather calculating α from
an FFD of the combined sample to ensure a suﬃcient num-
ber of ﬂares in each energy bin. The FFD of the 96 ﬂares in
our sample, shown in Figure 14, is ﬁt with the least-squares
power law of log(dN/dE) = Eα. We ﬁnd a value of α ∼1.43
±0.37, in agreement with previous α estimates across both
solar-like and dwarf stars (e.g. Audard et al. 2000; Mae-
hara et al. 2015; Yang & Liu 2019), suggesting that the
large portion of short duration ﬂares found in this work are
likely produced by the same physical dynamo mechanism.
Our FFD does however suggests that higher energy ﬂares
occur less frequently amongst this paper’s sample in com-
parison to previous work. Once the entirety of the archival
DWF optical data is mined for ﬂares, producing a full mag-
nitude limited catalog, FFDs for each spectral type can be
produced. This future work will assist with current research
into understanding ﬂare mechanisms between magnetically
weak giants and magnetically active dwarf stars.

4.7 Flare Rates

Across our 12 target ﬁelds and within 500 pc, we ﬁnd that
the number of ﬂares per hour varies considerably, having an
−1, see Table 3. Our daily
average of 0.5 ± 0.2 ﬂares deg
−1 is also comparable to
ﬂare rate of 10.54 ﬂares deg
−1 on sources of 3500K
the daily rate of 7.6 ﬂares deg
≤ Teﬀ ≤ 4000K across all ﬂare energies from (Feinstein et al.
2020).

We further breakdown ﬂare rates across the range of
integrated ﬂare energies, as shown in Table 4. We ﬁnd the
highest rates are associated with the lowest energy ﬂares as

with vertical distance from the Galactic plane, in agreement
with previous studies.

• We determine, using our sources transverse velocity,
that our ﬂares are generated from likely young stellar
sources.

• Our FFD conﬁrms a power law relationship between
ﬂare number and ﬂare energy, and generates a value of α is
consistent with previous work.

lected over 12 ﬁelds via the Deeper, Wider, Faster program
(DWF). The advantage of our choice of continuous blue ﬁl-
ter observations is our sensitivity to low-amplitude ﬂares,
where traditionally the detection eﬃciency drops at redder
wavelengths. Furthermore, the unique observation strategy
of DWF provides a 20-second cadence sensitive to uncover-
ing fast evolving short duration ﬂares. We search the light
curves of 19,914 sources, each with multiple nightly light
curves. The average time per visit was ∼74 minutes on each
◦
2.2

diameter DECam ﬁeld.
We ﬁnd 96 ﬂare events, occurring across 80 stars, from
our volume limited sample of 19,914 sources. We found the
following:

• Flares were found across K– M6 type stars, strongly

concentrated around the mid type M-dwarfs.

• The ﬂares identiﬁed vary greatly in both duration and
ﬂare energy. Duration’s span from ∼2.4 to ∼52 minutes, with
∼ 70% having duration’s < 8 minutes.

• The short duration ﬂares identiﬁed in this work span

vast energy distribution of 1031 – 1037 erg.

• We conﬁrm a strong relationship between ﬂare energy
and distance from the Galactic plane, with lower energy
ﬂares occurring ∼<100 pc. This is consistent with the es-
timated scale height of the Galactic young disk.

• The ﬂaring fraction of stars is also identiﬁed to decrease
