ABSTRACT 

In  the  near  future,  IoT  based  application  services  are  anticipated  to  collect  massive  amounts  of  data  on  which 
complex and diverse tasks are expected to be performed. Machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural 
Networks (ANN) are increasingly used in smart environments to predict the output for a given problem based on 
a set of tuning parameters as the input. To this end, we present an energy efficient neural network (EE-NN) service 
embedding  framework  for  IoT  based  smart  homes.  The  developed  framework  considers  the  idea  of  Service 
Oriented Architecture (SOA) to provide service abstraction for multiple complex modules of a NN which can be 
used  by  a  higher  application  layer.  We  utilize  Mixed  Integer  Linear  Programming  (MILP)  to  formulate  the 
embedding problem to minimize the total power consumption of networking and processing simultaneously. The 
results of the MILP model show that our optimized NN can save up to 86% by embedding processing modules in 
IoT devices and up to 72% in fog nodes due to the limited capacity of IoT devices.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The uptake of the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasing at unprecedented levels across a wide variety of domains 
in our daily lives, primarily due to the manufacturing advancement with respect to a reduction in cost, size, and 
power consumption of next-generation low-power radio transceivers and microcontrollers [1].  The number of  IoT 
devices is estimated to be between 26 billion to 50 billion devices [2]. The sheer number of IoT devices leads to 
the  generation  of  massive  amounts  of  data  which  is  usually  transported  over  multiple  domains  of  the  network 
towards the centralized cloud data center for processing to extract knowledge from the data [3] – [6]. The costly 
overhead of the transport network created a need for processing the collected data closer to the IoT end-devices, 
hence fog computing can fill this void by complementing the cloud and extending its services to the edge of the 
network  and  even  further  into  the  IoT  devices  [7]  –  [9].  Researchers  have  developed  a  chip  that  increases 
processing speed of computations in neural networks with impact on reducing the energy consumed between 94% 
to 95% which supports their use in smartphones and also in home appliances [10]. In the past, most of the IoT 
applications  aimed  at  passive  data  collection  and  monitoring,  however,  recently,  actuation  has  received  lots  of 
attention. Through the coupling of sensors and actuators that are capable of interacting with the physical world, it 
becomes  possible  for  next-generation  IoT  based  systems  to  perform  sophisticated  tasks  in  an  automated  and 
dynamic manner [11]. One of the applications as an example is an IoT based smart home in which sensors and 
actuators are coordinated intelligently to control given parameters such as energy usage based on the time of the 
day [12].  The topology of a neural network is based on three layers: 1) input, 2) hidden, and 3) output. As shown 
in Figure 1, the input nodes are all connected to each hidden node via communication links, and the data generated 
by the hidden nodes are fed into the output node(s) for actuation based on the weight of edges and bias values of 
hidden nodes [13]. The nodes within a NN are called neurons, which require processing to transform the input 
measurements into a desired output for the actuating nodes. Usually the edges between the neurons are needed to 
establish communication and synchronization for NN requests [14]. Conventionally, the data processing is mostly 
offloaded to a centralized cloud data center in which the input nodes’ data is routed through the local gateway 
towards remote servers located deeper into the network and once knowledge is extracted from the processed data, 
the required output signal is returned back to the IoT local gateway and then this signal is used by the actuator 
devices. Recently, researchers have paid much attention to ANN embedding in IoT based networks such as WSNs. 
The authors of [15] considered the use of the processing capabilities of low-power, cheap IoT nodes and their 
linkages, where the

IoT nodes maybe in a mesh topology, to implement an ANN. This approach realizes the fact that IoT nodes may 
be constrained by computational capacity and therefore may not be able to implement a full (deep) neural network 
at  each  IoT  node.  The  work  was  extended  in  [12]  by  enriching  their  optimization  framework  to  consider  low-
power routing protocols, accounting for the energy consumption of the communication in the ANN in order to 
optimize the allocation of hidded neurons and consequenctly improving the network lifetime. Their solution was 
also simulated on an IoT testbed to validate the feasibility of their concept together with measuring its performace 
against the centralized gateway in terms of latency. In this work, we build on the concepts in [12], [15] and extend 
the work by i) considering multiple IoT fields, hence data processing on aggregation nodes such as gateway fog 
and access fog tackles the embedding problem from another angle; (ii) introducing a practical network architecture 
that links the IoT fields, composed of PON elements, gateways and relays; (iii) introducing a focus on energy 
efficiency  captured  as  the  objective  of  our  MILP  formulation;  (iv)  casting  the  problem  into  a  service  oriented 
architecture, hence allowing these ANN embeddings to be included in a framework that can enable the embedding 
of other services such as security services (where the nodes may be interlinked motion sensors, processors and 
actuators  such  as  alarms),  energy  saving  services  (where  the  nodes  may  include  interlinked  motion  sensors, 
processors and actuators such as networked switches and displays.  

The work in this paper benefits from our previous proposals for improving energy efficiency in service 
embedding in IoT and core networks [16] – [22], server disaggregation in  data centers [23], content distribution 
and big data processing [23] - [28], and core, edge and fog processing in networks [29] – [34]. The remainder of 
this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the EE-NN embedding framework over the PON access 
network,  Section  3  discusses  the  performance  evaluation  and  the  results.  Finally,  Section  4  provides  the 
conclusions for the paper. 

2. ENERGY EFFICIENT NN EMBEDDING FRAMEWORK OVER PON ACCESS NETWORK  
In IoT based smart homes, different IoT devices are needed to monitor several variables inside a home such as 
door lights, fire and smoke detectors, and temperature sensors [35]. To enhance the smart home applications, the 
control system should make decisions and proactively execute different tasks through the predictive features of 
neural  networks  (NNs).  This  paper  aims  to  propose  a  framework  for  intelligent  IoT  based  smart  homes  by  i) 
embedding NN service requests into the physical infrastructure of an end-to-end IoT infrastructure supported by 
the concept of the fog, ii) evaluating several variations of processing platforms within the IoT, Fog, and cloud in 
terms of the total power consumption, iii) imposing processing placement to take place in predefined locations and 
lifting this limitation by allowing the MILP model to choose the optimal solution for the given scenarios. The NN 
service requests follow the idea of the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and such requests are made of a virtual 
topology that consists of virtual nodes and links [36], [37]. The virtual links represent the required communication 
between the virtual nodes of a NN request within the IoT network(s) and each virtual node requires processing. 
We consider that a NN request involves virtual nodes spanning over two different IoT networks hence the set of 
links to be optimized is only feasible in the IoT architecture due to its mesh topology. The evaluated framework 
as shown in Figure 2 is composed of three main layers; 1) Physical layer, 2) Network layer, and 3) the Application 
layer. The physical layer is composed of generic low-power IoT nodes that are connected via the Zigbee protocol 
[38].  Multiple  IoT  networks  are  connected  through  their  relay  devices  to  their  respective  access  points  (APs) 
mounted onto the ONU devices. The application layer in our model is considered as a set of virtual nodes within 
a NN service request while the network layer consists of the actual transport network which includes the PON 
access network elements (ONU and OLT) and a single metro network ethernet switch. There is also networking 
infrastructure inside processing nodes such as the Access Fog and the Cloud due to the location and size of these 
facilities.

Moreover, the framework considers the following assumptions: 

•  Virtual nodes within a NN request span multiple IoT networks, hence the PON access network is always 
required to be active in order to achieve the communication between connected virtual nodes. A virtual 
node’s  service  request  is  represented  by  typical  capacities  of  an  IoT  node  for  both  processing  and 
networking and this ranged from low to high workloads. Although the processing workload is varied, we 
have assumed the traffic data rate to remain constant as the same task may require different processing 
intensities.	

•  The framework considers multiple functions such as sensing functions, which are smart thermostats, and 
motion sensors. In addition, it has one control function and actuation functions which include alarms, 
actuated blinds. 

•  Each IoT node is mapped with one function of each type and each virtual node requests one function 

only. 

•  We have assumed that our framework accounts for a portion of the total idle power of those networking 
devices that have the potential to be shared by many users and applications such as ONUs, OLTs, Metro 
switches, Cloud LANs, etc.	

The results were obtained using AMPL/CPLEX software running on a high-performance computer with 16 
cores  processor  and  256  GB  of  RAM.  All  of  the  parameters  used  in  the  MILP  model,  both  networking  and 
processing, are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.

3. RESULTS AND EVALUATIONS 
In  our  topology  we  considered  two  separated  IoT  networks  that  are  connected  to  the  cloud  via  a  PON  access 
network.  Each  IoT  network  consisted  of  30  IoT  devices  and  2  relays.  In  addition,  the  IoT  networks  are  each 
connected  to  a  single  ONU  and  a  single  OLT  aggregates  traffic  from  both  ONUs.  The  distribution  of  the  IoT 
devices  in  both  networks  is  random  and  uniform.  All  devices  in  the  IoT  network  communicate  via  the  Zigbee 
protocol (IEEE 802.15) while the relay devices are connected to the ONUs via the Wi-Fi protocol. On the other 
hand, the ONUs are connected to the OLT device through an optical fiber link. Our model accounts for the total 
power  consumption  which  consists  of  two  parts:  1)  network  power  consumption  and  2)  processing  power 
consumption. We consider both uplink and downlink traffic as both types of communication are needed to achieve 
a neural network spanning multiple IoT networks. Consequently, we allow traffic to pass from one network to 
another through the OLT device. It has been shown from our previous work [16], [39], [41] that the fog approach 
which allows for hosting processing services closer to the IoT-end devices saves a considerable amount of power 
compared  to  the  traditional  centralized  cloud  approach.  To  this  end,  our  fog  approach  considered  3  layers  of 
processing namely the IoT, Gateway Fog, Access Fog layers as well as the cloud. We assumed that each NN is 
composed of five virtual nodes that are connected through three layers that involve input nodes, hidden nodes, and 
the output node(s). Each node within a NN request has a task requirement consisting of processing in MIPS and 
traffic in kbps. All requests are assumed to have 100% SLA since task blocking is not considered, however, nodes’ 
processing and networking capacity must be respected at all times. We have considered a linear power profile to 
calculate both networking and processing power consumptions and it consists of two parts: a) idle power and b) 

 
 
 
 
 
load proportional power. In order to undertake fair evaluations, we have assumed that the IoT application in this 
work is only responsible for a portion of the idle power (𝛿) of the high-capacity networking devices since such 
devices can be shared between many users and applications [39]. Thus, we considered three scenarios in which 
the value of 𝛿 was changed to 1% in scenario #1, 5% in scenario #2, and 10% in scenario #3. In each scenario, a 
range of homogenous processing demands between 20% - 100% of the IoT device’s processing capacity (MIPS) 
is considered. We evaluated different variations of processing in the proposed framework; 1) processing to take 
place only in the IoT layers, 2) processing to take place in the IoT and PON, 3) processing to take place only in 
PON, 4) allowing MILP model to choose processing location (optimal solution) and finally 5) all processing to 
take place in the centralized cloud (baseline). It is worth noting that variation 1-3, processing tasks are forced to 
be  distributed  among  the  relevant  layers  to  account  for  circumstances  where  not  all  fog  nodes  have  the  right 
software package to process all the tasks. Also, evaluating different values of 𝛿 is valid as this can represent the 
growth of the current application. Figure 3 shows the total power consumption of scenario #1 – to scenario #3 
while Figure 4 shows the total power savings (in %) of all the processing placement variations compared to the 
cloud. The IoT approach produces the highest savings of up to 86% across all scenarios due to the negligible power 
consumption of the low-power microcontroller type devices in the IoT layer. The IoT + PON approach achieved 
savings of up to 68% in scenario #1 due to the low value of 𝛿 = 1% whilst this increased up to 80% in scenario 
#3  due  to  the  expensive  network  overhead  to  get  to  the  cloud,  hence  𝛿 = 10%.  On  the  other  hand,  the  PON 
approach produced better savings than the IoT + PON due to better utilization of the PON fog servers and these 
savings were up to 72% and 84% for scenario #1 and scenario #2, respectively. In the last approach (MILP), we 
allowed the model to choose the optimal location for processing in all scenarios and as can be seen in Figure 4, 
the optimal allocation is the IoT approach.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper focused on developing a framework for energy efficient neural network (NN) embedding in IoT based 
smart home applications. The results use a MILP model which evaluates several processing placement solutions 
based on the concept of fog. A virtual topology of nodes and links represents the services to be embedded inline 
with the neural network process workflow and the service abstraction paradigm of SOA. The results show that the 
fog approach can produce power savings of up to 86% in all scenarios, given that the processing tasks are placed 
in IoT layer only. Generally, the fog approach despite the variation in the placement of tasks in different layers, 
produced substantial power savings compared to the centralized cloud solution.
