Abstract—  Volatility 

important 
characteristic  that  has  a  significant  effect  on  the  behavior  of 
stock markets. However, designing robust models for accurate 
prediction  of  future  volatilities  of  stock  prices  is  a  very 
challenging  research  problem.  We  present  several  volatility 
models  based  on  generalized  autoregressive  conditional 
heteroscedasticity  (GARCH)  framework  for  modeling  the 
volatility  of  ten  stocks  listed  in  the  national  stock  exchange 
(NSE)  of  India.  The  stocks  are  selected  from  the  auto  sector 
and the banking sector of the Indian economy, and they have a 
significant  impact  on  the  sectoral  index  of  their  respective 
sectors in the NSE. The historical stock price records from Jan 
1, 2010, to Apr 30, 2021, are scraped from the Yahoo Finance 
website using the DataReader API of the Pandas module in the 
Python  programming  language.  The  GARCH  modules  are 
built and fine-tuned on the training data and then tested on the 
out-of-sample data to evaluate the performance of the models. 
The  analysis  of  the  results  shows  that  asymmetric  GARCH 
models yield more accurate forecasts on the future volatility of 
stocks.

INTRODUCTION  

While  building  robust  and  high  precision  models  for 
accurate prediction of future stock has been considered a hot 
area  of  research,  measuring  and  forecasting  volatility  in 
future  stock  values  poses  a  more  challenge.  Interestingly, 
even  though  volatility  in  the  stock  market  can  present  a 
significant risk to the investors, when correctly modeled and 
harnessed,  it  can  be  a  source  of  substantial  return  in 
investments.  Even  if  stock  markets  may  fluctuate,  crash,  or 
surge,  there  is  always  a  window  of  opportunity  for  profit  if 
volatility  in  the  market  can  be  exploited.  Classically, 
volatility is a measure of the dispersion of a return series of a 
stock,  and  it  is  measured  by  the  standard  deviation  of  the 
return series. The standard deviation of a return series of the 
stock shows how closely the return values from the stock are 
grouped  or  clustered  around  its  mean  value.  If  the  return 
values  are  tightly  coupled  with  each  other  over  a  period  of 
time,  the  standard  deviation,  and  hence  the  volatility  of  the 
series, is small. On the other hand, a high value of standard 
deviation  implies  significant  volatility  in  the  series.  In  a 
recent research work carried out by Crestmont Research, the 
relationship  between  the  performance  of  stock  markets  and 
their volatility has been studied [1]. Based on the analysis of 
Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P500), Crestmont Research 
found  that  higher  volatility  in  the  stock  market  is  usually 
associated  with  a  higher  probability  of  a  declining  index, 
while  lower  volatility  is  more  likely  to  lead  to  a  rise  in  the 
index  of  the  stock  market.  This  association  of  stock  market 

volatility  with  its  index  value  can  be  gainfully  exploited  by 
the  investors  in  making  long-term  investment  strategies  for 
building their portfolios.   

While  there  are  numerous  factors  that  can  affect  the 
volatility  of  stock  markets,  regional  and  economic  factors 
such  as  taxation  policies,  monetary  and  fiscal  policies, 
including  interest  rates,  have  a  significant  impact  on  the 
directional  changes  in  the  market,  influencing  the  volatility 
by  a  substantial  degree.  In  India,  for  example,  when  the 
central  bank,  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  announces  any 
change  in  the  short-term  interest  rates  for  the  banks,  the 
volatility  in  the  stock  market  immediately  goes  up.  Higher 
volatility that is associated with bear markets usually leads to 
investors rebalancing their portfolios of stocks.     

However,  accurate  forecasting  of  future  volatility  in  the 
stock market is a very difficult task. Despite the availability 
of  a  large  number  of  propositions  and  models  in  the 
literature,  most  of  these  models  are  found  to  work  sub-
optimally in real world applications leading to an inaccurate 
forecast  of  volatility.  This  paper  presents  a  gamut  of 
volatility  models  based  on  the  approach  of  generalized 
autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) [2]. 
We build the models using the historical stock price data in 
the NSE from Jan 1, 2010, to Apr 30, 2021. Ten stocks are 
chosen  from  two  important  sectors  of  the  Indian  economy- 
the  auto  sector  and  the  banking  sector.  From  each  of  these 
two  sectors,  the  top  five  stocks  are  chosen,  and  several 
GARCH models are built, fine-tuned, and then backtested on 
the  out-of-sample  data.  Extensive  analysis  is  done  on  the 
evaluation of the performance of the volatility models.    

The work has two major contributions. First, it proposes 
a  set  of  GARCH  models,  which  are  built,  fine-tuned,  and 
backtested  on  real  world  stock  price  data  over  a  period  of 
more than ten years from different sectors of the Indian stock 
market.  Second,  it  provides  a  benchmark  of  comparison  of 
the  volatility  of  the  two  sectors,  which  are  studied  in  this 
work. Proper knowledge of the volatilities of the two sectors 
will enable a potential investor  to understand the associated 
risk and return of the sectors.        

We  organize  the  paper  as  follows.  Section  II  briefly 
presents  some  of  the  important  recent  works  on  volatility 
modeling.  Section  III  present  a  discussion  on  how  the 
relevant  data  are  extracted  and  a  step-by-step  approach 
followed  in  the  research  methodology.  Section  IV  presents 
extensive results on the volatility of two important sectors of 
the NSE of India.  Finally, Section V concludes the paper.  

II.  RELATED WORK 
Researchers have done extensive works on the volatility 
analysis of stock  markets and the design of robust portfolio 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                              
systems  based  on  the  forecast  of  volatility  and  future  stock 
prices  using  sophisticated  predictive  models  [3-6].  A 
significant  number  of  models  based  on  the  GARCH  (1,1) 
framework  have  been  proposed,  and  it  has  been  observed 
that  the  generalized  distribution  of  the  residuals  of  these 
models  is  more  accurate  in  assessing  the  volatility  of  the 
series than other models of residuals [7]. While some studies 
found  that  the  asymmetric  GJR-GARCH  model  produces 
more  accurate  forecasts  on  conditional  variances  when  the 
volatility  is  higher,  in  most  of  the  real-world  scenarios,  the 
EGARCH model yields more accurate forecasts in situations 
of  asymmetric  volatility  [8].  It  has  been  observed  that 
GARCH-based  volatility  models  yield  more  stable  and 
robust  forecasts  while  the  sensitivity  of  entropy-based 
forecasts  is  higher  [9].  Hence,  the  entropy-based  models 
react  faster 
the  availability  of  new 
to 
information. The return analysis of fifteen important sectors 
of the Indian economy has been done based on the forecasted 
output of a deep learning-based long-and-short-term memory 
(LSTM)  network  model  [10].  The  study  reveals  that  while 
the  FMCG  sector  remains  the  most  profitable  one,  the 
aggregate  returns  of  the  power  sector  are  the  lowest. 
Multivariate  GARCH  models  have  also  been  proposed  for 
analyzing  the  volatilities  of  several  contemporaneous  time 
series [11].

III.  DATA AND METHODOLOGY 
The  methodology  we  followed  in  this  work  consists  of 

ten steps. In the following, the steps are described in detail.  

(1)  Data  extraction:  We  use  the  DataReader  API  from 
the panadas module to extract the stock price data from the 
Yahoo  Finance  website.  The  parameters  passed  to  the 
DataReader  function  are  the  ticker  name  of  the  stock,  the 
website from which the records are extracted, the start date, 
the  end  date,  and  the  attributes  of  the  data  extracted.  For 
example,  for  extracting  Maruti  Suzuki  stock  price  records 
listed in the NSE from the Yahoo Finance website from the 
date start to the date end, with the attributes high, low, open, 
close, volume, and adjusted close, the required python code 
is:  maruti  =  web.DataReader  ('MARUTI.NS',  'yahoo',  start, 
end)[['High', 'Low', 'Open', 'Close', 'Adj Close']]. For all the 
stocks, we use the start date as Jan 1, 2010, and the end date 
as Apr 30, 2021. 

(2) Hurst exponent and volatility computation: Once the 
stock  price  records  are  extracted,  we  compute  the  Hurst 
exponent  of  the  time  series  of  the  close  prices.  The  Hurst 
exponent  is  a  measure  of  the  long-term  behavior  of  a  time 
series.  It  measures  the  autocorrelations  among  the  values  at 
different lags in a time series and computes the rates at which 
the  autocorrelations  decrease  with  the  lag  values.  Based  on 
these computations, Hurst exponent calculates a measure that 
determines  whether  a  time  series  regresses  strongly  to  a 
mean  value  or  clusters  towards  a  direction,  upward  to 
downward. A value of  the Hurst exponent between 0 to 0.5 
indicates  a  time  series  exhibiting  long-term  switching 
between successive high and low values. For these types of 
time series, a high value is usually followed by a low value. 
A  value of 0.5  for  the  Hurst exponent  implies  a  time  series 
consisting  of  uncorrelated  values.  For  these  types  of  time 
series,  the  autocorrelations  decay  exponentially  and  quickly 
go  down  to  zero.  Time  series  with  Hurst  exponent  values 
between  0.5  to  1  have  long-term  positive  correlations, 
wherein a high value is likely to be followed by another high 

value, and the long-term future values also tend to be higher. 
We  compute  the  Hurst  exponent  for  all  stocks  using  a 
function  that  computes  the  autocorrelations  at  all  possible 
lags in the series with a maximum lag of 100. 

After computing the Hurst exponent of a stock based on 
its  close  index,  we  compute  the  volatility  of  the  series.  The 
daily  volatility  is  determined  by  computing  the  standard 
deviation  of  the  daily  return  values.  The  monthly  and  the 
annual  volatility  values  are  computed  by  multiplying  the 
daily  volatility  by  a  factor  of  the square  root  of  21  and  the 
square root of 252, respectively, assuming that there are 21 
working  days  in  a  month  and  252  working  days  in  a  year. 
For  computing  the  standard  deviation  of  a  series,  the  std 
function defined in Python is used. 

(3) Study of the statistical properties of the return series 
and the log return series: In this step, we compute the return 
series  and  the  log  return  series.  For  obtaining  the  return 
series,  we  use  the  pct_change  function  in  Python.  The  log 
return  series  is  computed  by  first  applying  the  log  function 
on the close values of the stock. The log function is defined 
in  the  NumPy library.  The  successive  differences of  the  log 
values  over  different  days  are  computed  using  the  diff 
function.  Finally,  the  results  of  the  diff  function  are 
multiplied  by  100  to  obtain  the  percentage  of  log  return 
values. We plot the return series, the log return series, their 
Q-Q  (Quantile-Quantile)  plots,  the  autocorrelation  function 
(ACF)  plots,  and  the  partial  autocorrelation  function 
(PACF)  plots.  For  plotting  these  graphs,  we  use  a  max  lag 
value of 100 so that significant lags for the ACF and PACF 
plots  can  be  identified,  even  if  the  lag  values  are  high.  The 
Q-Q  plots  reveal  the  important  statistical  measures  of  the 
series like mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. 

(4) Fitting a GARCH (1,1) model with a constant mean 
and  normally  distributed  residuals:  In  this  step,  we  build 
volatility  models  for  the  stock  price  time  series.  First,  we 
build  a  GARCH  (1,1)  with  a  constant  mean  and  normally 
distributed  residuals.  A  GARCH  model  of  this  type  can  be 
 represent  the 
expressed  as  (1)  in  which 
residual and the variance at the time instant t-1, respectively, 
 represents that variance at time instant t. The first term, ω 
represents  a  constant  variance  that  corresponds  to  the  long-
run average volatility, the coefficient α represents the effect 
of the square of the residual value at time instant t-1, and the 
coefficient  β  represents  the  effect  of  the  variance  at  time 
instant t-1 on the volatility at time instant t, i.e., 

 and 

. 

                                            (1)  

The  GARCH  model  uses  residuals  as  the  volatility 
shocks. For the GARCH (1,1) model at this step, we assume 
that  the  residuals  follow  a  normal  distribution  with  a  zero

Using  the  arch_model  function  defined  in  the  arch 
module  of  Python,  we  fit  a  GARCH  (1,1)  model  with 
constant mean and normally distributed residuals. Using the 
summary function of the model, we determine the values of 
the  parameters  ω,  α,  and  β  of  the  GARCH  model  and  their 
respective  p-values.  The  Akaike  information  criteria  (AIC) 
of  the  model  is  also  found  out.  The  standardized  residuals

as  predicted  by  the  GARCH  model.  The  standardized 
residuals are the residual values normalized by the volatility 
values.  

than  a  normal  distribution.  A 

(5) Fitting a GARCH (1,1) model with a constant mean 
and  skewed-t  distributed  residuals:  Since  the  stock  return 
and  the  log  return  values  usually  do  not  follow  a  normal 
distribution, we fine-tune the GARCH model built in Step 4 
by  assuming  the  residuals  to  follow  a  skewed  t  distribution 
rather

symmetric  around  its  mean  like  a  normal  distribution,  but 
since  it  has  a  much  wider  spread  of  its  two  tails,  it  can 
accommodate values that are far away from the mean value. 
We also plot the volatility of the GARCH (1,1) model with 
skewed-t error distribution with respect to the daily return of 
the stock to verify how accurately the GARCH model is able 
to capture the pattern of variations of the daily return series.   

t-distribution 

(6)  Identifying  the  best-fit  ARMA  model  for  the  log 
return series: In this step, we find the best-fit autoregressive 
moving average (ARMA) model for the log return series of 
the  stock.  We  use  the  auto_arima  function  defined  in  the 
pmdarima  module  of  Python  for  finding  the  best-fit  model. 
The  model  that  yields  the  lowest  value  for  Bayesian 
information criteria (BIC) is the optimum one. We also note 
the number of iterations needed to find the best-fit model.   

(7)  Fitting  the  ARMA  residuals  into  a  GARCH  (1,1) 
model:  The  best  ARMA  model  is  fitted  on  the  log  return 
series, and the residuals of the model are computed using the 
resid  attribute  of  the  model.  A  GARCH  (1,1)  model  with 
zero mean (as the residuals are assumed to have a zero mean) 
is  then  fitted  into  the  residuals  of  the  ARMA  model.  Using 
the summary function of the GARCH model, we find out the 
parameters ω, α, and β and their corresponding p-values. The 
AIC of the model is also noted. The significance levels of the 
p-values show the goodness of fit of the GARCH model into 
the ARMA model’s residuals.  

(8)  Fitting  asymmetric  volatility  models  on  the  return 
series  and  evaluating  the  goodness  of  fits  of  the  models: 
The GARCH models built in the previous steps assume that 
positive  and  negative  news  have  a  similar  impact  on  the 
volatility.  This  assumption  does  not  hold  good  in  the  real 
world, where the impact of negative news on the volatility of 
return  is  more  than  the  impact  of  positive  news.  To 
effectively model the volatility of the return series, GARCH 
models must have the capability of handling the asymmetric 
nature  of  the  impact.  We  build  two  asymmetric  models  for 
this purpose, (i) GJR-GARCH and (ii) EGARCH.  

The GJR-GARCH (1,1,1) model is given by (3). In (3), γ

Both GJR-GARCH (1,1,1) and EGARCH (1,1,1) models 
are  implemented  using  the  arch_model  function  in  Python 
with  the  parameters  p=1,  q=1,  and  o=1,  and  the  error 
distribution set to t. The summary functions of the models are 
invoked  to  determine  the  values  of  the  parameters  ω,  α,  γ, 
and β, and their respective p-values. We plot the return series 
with  the  forecasted  volatility  values  of  GJR-GARCH  and 
EGARCH  models  to  check  how  close  the  forecasted 
volatility  values  are  with  respect  to  the  actual  volatility 
values of the return series. 

(9)  Testing  the  accuracy  of  the  EGARCH  volatility 
forecasting:  In  this  step,  we  use  two  different  methods  of 
forecasting,  the  expanding  window  method  and  the  fixed 
window  method,  to  compute  the  forecasted  volatility  using 
the  EGARCH  model  on  the  out-of-sample  data  from  Jan  1, 
2021,  to  Apr  30,  2021.  In  the  fixed  window  method,  based 
on  the  previous  five  days'  volatility  values,  the  volatility 
values for the next five days are forecasted. In this case, the 
size of the training window (i.e., five days) remains constant. 
However, for the expanding window method, the size of the 
training  window  increases  with  the  number  of  rounds  of 
forecasting.  Finally,  the  forecasted  volatility  values  versus 
the actual volatility of the return series are plotted.  

(10)  Backtesting  the  EGARCH  models  on  the  out-of-
sample data: In the final step, we carry out backtesting of the 
EGARCH model on the return series and compute the mean 
absolute  error  (MAE),  and  the  root  mean  square  error 
(RMSE) of the model.  

IV.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

This  section  presents  extensive  experimental  results  on 
the  performance  of  the  various  volatility  models  based  on 
GARCH.   

For  the  purpose  of  our  study,  we  select  two  important 
sectors of stocks listed in the NSE. These two sectors are the 
auto sector and the banking sector. We identify the top five 
stocks  from  each  of  these  two  sectors  based  on  the  NSE 
indexogram  reports  [12].  We  use  the  Python  programming 
language  version  3.7.4  for  implementing  the  GARCH 
models  in  this  work.  Using  the  DataReader  function  of  the 
pandas_datareader module, the historical stock price records 
are  extracted  from  Jan  1,  2010,  to  Apr  30,  2021,  from  the 
Yahoo Finance website. The GARCH models are built using 
the  arch_model  function  defined  in  the  arch  module  of 
Python.  The  orders  of  the  ARMA  models  are  determined 
using  the  auto_arima  function  defined  in  the  pmdarima 
module  in  Python.  The  models  are  trained  and  tested  on  a 
system  with  an  Intel  i7-9750H  processor,  having  a  clock 
speed  of  2.60GHz-2.59  GHz,  16  GB  RAM,  running  on  the 
operating  system  of  Windows  10.  We  present  extensive 
results for the two sectors in the following.  

Auto sector: The top five stocks of the auto sector listed 
in the NSE are: (i) Maruti Suzuki India (MSZ), (ii) Mahindra 
and  Mahindra  (MAH),  (iii)  Tata  Motors  (TAM),  (iv)  Bajaj 
Auto (BAJ), and (v) Hero MotoCorp (HMC). The respective 
percentages  of  weights  of  these  five  stocks  used  in 

 
 
 
 
  
computing the auto sector index are as follows: MSU-18.72, 
MMH-15.72, TMO-11.50, BAJ-10.89, HMC-7.99 [12].  

times the gradients are updated (Grad Eval), and the value of 
the log-likelihood function (Log-Likelihood).     

The Hurst exponents and the daily, monthly, and annual 
volatility values of the stocks are presented in Table I. Due to 
space constraints, we present the visuals for only the topmost 
stock  from  each  sector.  Figure  1  presents  some  important 
characteristics  of  the  log  return  series  of  the  Maruti  Suzuki 
stock.  Figure 2 depicts the properties of the daily volatility 
series of the Maruti Suzuki stock. From Table 1, it is evident 
that the stocks BAJ, MAH, and HMC exhibit mean-reverting 
characteristics,  while  the  series  of  MSZ  and  TAM  show  a 
mild mean-reverting property based on their Hurst exponent 
values. The annual volatility (which is used as the measure of 
the volatility of a series) is the highest for TAM, while BAJ 
exhibits the lowest value of annual volatility.

Tables II and III present important statistical properties of 
the log return series and the daily volatility of the log return 
series  of  the  auto  sector  stocks.  From  Table  II,  it  is  evident 
that while the mean values of the log return series of all the 
stocks are zero, the standard deviation, the skewness, and the 
kurtosis  for  TAM  are  the  highest.  The  same  observation  is 
noted in Table III. It is, therefore, concluded that TAM is the 
most  volatile  stock  in  the  auto  sector.  BAJ,  on  the  other 
hand,  is  found  to  exhibit  the  lowest  volatility  in  this  sector.

the  daily  volatility  series  are  found  to  be  significant  over 
large  values  of  lags.  We  plotted  the  ACF  and  the  PACF 
graphs  for  a  max  value  of  lag  of  100  and  found  that  these 
plots are significant over large lags. These are evident from 
Figures 1 and 2. 

Next,  we  fit a  GARCH  (1,1)  model  on  the  return  series 
using a constant mean, volatility model as GARCH, and the 
error distribution as normal. We use the arch_model function 
with  parameters,  p=1,  q=1,  mean=constant,  vol=GARCH, 
and  dist=normal.  Table  IV  presents  the  results  for  the 
GARCH  (1,1)  model  fitting  on  the  return  series  of  the  five 
stocks  of  the  auto  sector.  The  columns  in  Table  IV  show 
respectively  the  name  of  the  stocks  (Stock),  the  number  of 
iterations  needed  to  fit  the  model into  the  return  series  data

likelihood function) is evaluated (Func Eval), the number of

Table  V  presents  the  summary  of  the  GARCH  (1,1) 
model  with  constant  mean,  and  normally  distributed  error. 
The parameter mu refers to the constant mean, omega refers 
to  the  constant  variance  that  corresponds  to  the  long-run 
average  volatility,  alpha  is  the  new  information  (i.e.,  the 
innovation) in the current round that was not available in the 
previous round, and beta refers to the forecasted volatility of 
the previous period. In simple words, alpha is the coefficient 
of the square of the residuals in the previous round, and beta 
is the coefficient associated with the variance of the previous 
round. The higher the value of alpha, the bigger is the impact 
of the shock. On the other hand, the larger the value of beta, 
the  longer  is  the  shock  duration.  It  is  observed  in  Table  V, 
the value of alpha is the highest for MSZ, while for TAM, it 
is  the  lowest.  Hence,  the  impact  of  a  shock  (i.e.,  a  sudden 
change)  is  the  most  in  MSZ,  while  that  is  the  least  for  the 
TAM stock. On the other hand, based on the values of beta,

while it is the shortest for HMC.   

information  criteria,  we  identify  the  best-fit  ARMA  model 
for the log return series of the stocks. Table VI presents the 
results. It is observed that for all five stocks, ARMA (0,0,0) 
(0,0,0) with no intercept is the best-fit model. The residuals 
of this ARMA are then fitted into a zero-mean GARCH (1,1) 
model. Table VII presents the results for the five stocks. It is 
observed that the p-values of most of the alpha and the beta 
coefficients are significant, indicating that the residuals have 
fitted very well into the constant mean GARCH model.

Next, we change the error model from normal to skewed-
t.  In  the  financial  time  series,  the  residuals  are  not  normal 
most of the time, and hence, the assumption of the residuals 
following  a  skewed-t  distribution  is  more  realistic.  We  use 
the  arch_model  function  to  fit  a  GARCH  (1,1)  model  with 
the  parameter  dist=skewt  and  keeping  all  other  parameters 
the same as in the GARCH (1,1) model built earlier with the 
assumption  of  normally  distributed  residuals.  Figure  4 
depicts 
the  GARCH  model  volatility  with  skewed-t 
distributed residuals vs. the daily return values for the MSZ 
stock. It is evident that the GARCH model is able to capture 
the volatility pattern of the return series very accurately.

error vs. daily return   

To  further  improve  the  GARCH  (1,1)  model,  next,  we 
model the log-returns of the close prices of the stock with an 
ARMA  model  and  then  fit  the  residuals  of  the  ARMA 
models to estimate the volatility of the log return series with 
a  new  GARCH  model.  For  this  purpose,  we  use  the 
auto_arima  function  defined  in  the  pmdarima  module  of 
Python.  Using  the  auto_arima  function  and  BIC  as  the

For  further  improving  the  accuracy  of  the  GARCH 
models, we build two asymmetric models using the concepts 
of  GJR-GARCH  and  EGARCH.  The  asymmetric  models 
more  effectively  capture  the  volatility  of  financial  times 
series of the real world. We first fit a GJR-GARCH model on 
the  return  series  of  the  auto  sector  stocks.  The  arch_model 
function  is  called  with  the  following  parameters:  p=1,  q=1, 
o=1,  vol=GARCH,  and  dist=t.  This  creates  a  GJR-GARCH 
(1,1,1)  model  having  a  constant  mean  value,  residuals 
following  a  t  distribution,  and  the  volatility  with  an 
asymmetric  GARCH  pattern.  The  asymmetric  shock 
considered in this model is of one lag. Table VIII shows the 
model  summary  of  the  five  stocks  of  the  auto  sector.  It  is 
found that almost all the gamma and the beta coefficients are 
significant. Thus, the one-lag asymmetric shocks and one-lag 
variances  are  found  to  be  the  most  significant  predictors  in 
the GJR-GARCH volatility model of the auto sector stocks.  

Finally,  we  build  another  asymmetric  volatility  model 
using  EGARCH  (1,1,1).  Unlike  other  GARCH  models, 
EGARCH  does  not  have  any  requirement  of  the  alpha  and 
the  beta  parameters  to  be  non-negative.  Hence,  EGARCH 
model  building  requires  less  amount  of  time.  We  use  the 
arch_model  function  with  the  parameter  vol=EGARCH  and 
the rest of the values of the parameters identical to what has 
been used in the GJR-GARCH model. Table IX presents the 
summary of the EGARCH models for the auto sector stocks. 
The model is found to be a very good fit on the return values 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of  the  stocks  as  almost  all  alpha,  gamma,  and  beta 
coefficients are significant. Table X presents the BIC values 
for  the  GJR-GARCH  and  EGARCH  models  for  the  auto 
sector  stocks.  Except  for  MAH,  the  BIC  for  the  EGARCH 
model  is  found  to  be  lower  than  that  of  the  corresponding 
GJR-GARCH  model.  Figure  6  exhibits  the  return  series  of 
MSZ,  the  GJR-GARCH  volatility,  and  the  EGARCH 
volatility. It is evident, the performance of both the GARCH 
models  are  almost  identical,  and  both  the  models  have 
accurately captured the volatility of the return series of MSZ.

reason for the high MAE and RMSE values for TAM is due 
to the high volatility of the stock.    

  Banking  sector:  The  five  stocks  that  contribute  most 
significantly in the computation of the banking sector index 
of the NSE and their respective weights in percentage figures 
are: (i) HDFC Bank (HDB) – 27.41, (ii) ICICI Bank (ICB) – 
21.09,  Axis  Bank  (AXB)  –  14.30,  Kotak  Mahindra  Bank 
(KMB) – 13.02, State Bank of India (SBI) – 11.74 [12]. 

Table  XII  presents  the  Hurst  exponent,  the  daily, 
monthly,  and  annual  volatility  of  the  five  stocks  of  the 
banking sector. It is evident that AXB, ICB, and SBI exhibit 
a very mild trending nature, while HDB and KMB are mean-
reverting types. While AXB is the most volatile stock, HDB 
exhibits the least volatility among the five stocks.

Using  the  expanding  rolling  window  method  and  the 
fixed rolling window method, we forecast the volatility of the 
MSZ  return  series  from  Jan  1,  2021,  for  80  data  points. 
Figure  7  exhibits  the  results.  It  is  evident  that  both  the 
forecasting  methods  have  yielded  identical  forecasts.  It  is 
also clearly seen  that the  models have been able to forecast 
the volatility of the return series quite effectively.

To evaluate the performance of the EGARCH model on 
the  return  series  of  the  auto  sector  stocks,  we  carry  out 
backtesting  of  the  model.  Table  XI  presents  the  mean 
absolute  error  (MAE)  and  the  root  mean  square  error 
(RMSE) of the model for all five stocks. For computing the 
MAE 
the 
mean_absolute_error and the mean_squared_error functions 
defined in the metric submodule of the sklearn module. The 

values,  we 

the  RMSE 

and 

use 

Fig. 8. HDFC Bank daily log return: (a) the daily log return plot, (b) the Q-Q 
plot, (c) the ACF plot, (d) the PACF plot.  

Table  XIII  and  Figure  8  present  some 

important 
statistical  properties  of  the  log  return  series  of  the  banking 
sector stocks. While all return series have zero mean values, 
the  SD  of  the  AXB  stock  is  found  to  be  the  highest.  The 
magnitude of the skewness and the kurtosis of AXB are also 
found  to  be  the  highest  among  all  the  five  stocks  of  the 
banking  sector  indicating  that  it  is  the  most  volatile  one 
among the banking sector stocks. The significant lags for the 
ACF  and  the  PACF  plots  of  the  log  return  series  of  all  the 
stocks  are  found  to  be very high.  For  plotting  the ACF  and 
PACF, a maximum lag value of 100 has been used.  

Table XIV and Figure 9 depict the characteristics of the 
volatility of the log return series of the stocks. Again, we find 
that  the  mean  values  of  all  the  volatility  values  of the  daily 
log  return  are  zero.  AXB  exhibits  the  highest  value  for  the 
SD, the skewness, and the kurtosis of the volatility of the log 
return series. The volatility of SBI also shows high values of 
skewness and kurtosis. The significant lags for the ACF and 
the PACF plots are found to be high for the volatility series 
as well.

As in the case of the auto sector stocks, we fit a constant-
mean GARCH (1,1) model on the return series with normally

the variance of the last round of volatility forecasting. A high 
value  of  alpha  causes  more  impact  of  a  shock  on  the 
volatility,  while  a  large  beta  value  causes  the  impact  to 
remain effective over a longer period of time. SBI is found to 
have the highest value of alpha, while the parameter value is 
the  lowest  for  HDB.  Hence,  the  impact  of  a  shock  is  the 
highest for SBI, and it is the least for HDB. On the basis of 
the beta values, HDB has the longest duration of the impact 
of a shock, while SBI has the least duration of an impact.       

The  standardized  residuals  and  the  conditional  volatility 
of the HDB stock return series as computed by the GARCH 
(1,1) model are shown in Figure 10. This GARCH model is 
built  based  on  two  assumptions:  (i)  a  constant  mean  of  the 
return series and (ii) normally distributed residuals.

As we did for the auto sector stocks, to make our models 
more  realistic,  we  build  a  GARCH  model  with  the 
assumption of the residuals following a skewed-t distribution 
instead  of  a  normal  distribution.  In  building  this  model,  the 
function  arch_model  is  used  with  the  parameter  dist=skewt. 
The other parameters are kept  identical to those used in the 
GARCH  model  with  normally  distributed  residuals.  Figure 
11  depicts  the  GARCH  model  volatility  with  skewed-t 
distributed residuals and the daily return values of the HDB 
stock.  It  is  seen  that  the  volatility  model  very  closely 
followed the daily return volatility of the stock.

constant mean GARCH model with normal error  

The summary of the constant-mean GARCH (1,1) model 
with  normally  distributed  residuals  for  the  banking  sector 
stocks  is  presented  in  Table  XVI.  As  explained  earlier,  the 
parameters mu, omega, alpha, and beta refer to the constant 
mean, the long-term constant variance, the coefficient of the 
square of the last round residual value, and the coefficient of

Next, we fine-tune the GARCH (1,1) model. We build an 
ARMA model using the log-returns of the close prices of the 
stocks.  The  residuals  of  the  ARMA  model  are  fitted  into  a 
GARCH model to estimate the long-term volatility of the log 
return  series.  The  auto_arima  function  defined  in  the 
pmdarima module of Python is used to identify the order of 
the ARMA model. With the BIC as the information criteria, 
the  order  of  the  best-fit  ARMA  model  is  determined.  This 
ARMA model is fitted on the log return series of the stocks.  
Table  XVII  depicts  the  results.  Similar  to  the  auto  sector 
stocks,  for  all  the  five  stocks  of  the  banking  sector,  the 
ARMA  (0,0,0)  (0,0,0)  with  no  intercept  is  found  to  be  the 
best-fit  model.  A  zero-mean  GARCH  (1,1)  model  is  fitted 
into the residuals of the ARMA model. The summary of the 
GARCH  model  is  presented  in  Table  XVIII.  Most  of  the 
coefficients  of  omega,  alpha,  and  beta  are  found  to  have 
significant p-values indicating a very good model fit.

V.  CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have proposed several volatility models 
based on different variants of GARCH. The models are built 
on the historical stock price data from Jan 1, 2010, to Apr 30, 
2021.  The  stocks  are  chosen  from  the  auto  sector  and  the 
banking  sector  of  the  NSE  of  India.  The  models  are  fine-
tuned  and  then  backtested  on  the  out-of-sample  data  to 
estimate  their  accuracy  in  the  prediction  of  future  volatility 
of the stocks. While it is observed that asymmetric GARCH 
models  outperform  their  symmetric  counterparts,  EGARCH 
is found to have yielded the most accurate results.

and EGARCH-fitted volatility  

As  in  the  case  of  auto  sector  stocks,  for  making  the 
volatility  model  more  accurate,  we  build  two  asymmetric 
models,  EJR-GARCH  and  EGARCH.  The  asymmetric 
models  more  effectively  capture  the  volatility  of  financial 
times series of the real world. First, the GJR-GARCH model 
is  built  using  the  arch_model  function  with  the  parameters 
p=1,  q=1,  o=1,  vol=GARCH,  and  dist=t.  A  constant-mean 
GJR-GARCH  model  is  created  whose  residuals  follow  a  t 
distribution,  with  one-lag  asymmetric  shock  as  significant. 
The summary of the model is presented in Table XIX. Since 
all gamma and beta coefficients are significant, it is clear that 
the one-lag asymmetric shocks and one-lag variances are the 
dominating  components  of  the  model.  The  results  of  the 
EGARCH (1,1) model in Table XX indicates a better model 
fit  that  the  GJR-GARCH  (1,1)  since  all  the  coefficients  are 
significant here. From Table XXI, it is evident that the BIC 
of the EGARCH model is smaller than that of GJR-GARCH 
for  all  stock  excepts  AXB,  indicating  its  better  fit  into  the 
stock price data. Figure 14 exhibits the return series of HDB 
and  the  volatilities  of  the  GJR-GARCH  and  the  EGARCH. 
Table XXII presents the mean absolute error (MAE) and the 
root  mean  square  error  (RMSE)  of  the  EGARH  model  for 
all  five  stocks  of  the  banking  sector.  It  is  evident  that  the 
model has performed very well on the out-of-sample data.
