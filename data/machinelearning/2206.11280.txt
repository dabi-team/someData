ABSTRACT

Context. Spectroscopic data are necessary to break degeneracies in asteroseismic modelling of the interior structure in high- and
intermediate-mass stars. With the TESS mission, the number of bright intermediate-mass B-type stars with long photometric light
curves, that are therefore suitable for detailed asteroseismic studies, has increased substantially compared to the pre-TESS era.
Aims. We derive precise photospheric stellar parameters for a sample of 166 B-type stars with TESS light curves through a homo-
geneous spectroscopic analysis. The variability types of these sample stars are also classiﬁed based on all currently available TESS
sectors and ultimately prioritised according to their astrophysical potential.
Methods. We obtained high-resolution spectra for all 166 targets with the FEROS spectrograph in the context of a large program.
The spectra are reduced with the CERES pipeline, that we adapted to improve the quality of the reduced spectra. These spectra are
subsequently analysed with the zeta-Payne, a machine learning-based spectrum analysis algorithm, to infer precise stellar labels for
all stars in the sample. Furthermore, the Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD) method is employed to investigate spectral line proﬁle
variability (LPV) and isolate binary systems from presumably single stars.
Results. The LSD proﬁle analysis identiﬁed 26 spectroscopic double-lined binaries; the remainder of the sample are 42 supergiants in
the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy and 98 Galactic stars, both with and without apparent LPV. For the Galactic single stars and single-
lined spectroscopic binaries, we determine their ﬁve main surface parameters: eﬀective temperature (Teﬀ), surface gravity (log g),
global metallicity ([M/H]), projected rotational velocity (v sin i), and microturbulent velocity (ξ) with average formal precisions of
70 K, 0.03 dex, 0.07 dex, 8 km s−1, and 0.7 km s−1 respectively. The average internal uncertainties we ﬁnd for FEROS spectra with our
spectrum analysis method are 430 K (Teﬀ), 0.12 dex (log g), 0.13 dex ([M/H]), 12 km s−1 (v sin i), and 2 km s−1 (ξ).
Conclusions. We ﬁnd spectroscopic evidence that eight of the 98 galactic single or SB1 variables are fast rotating gravity-mode
pulsators occurring in between the slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars and δ Scuti instability strips. The g-mode frequencies of these
pulsators are shifted to relatively high frequency values due to their rotation, and their apparently too low Teﬀ relative to the SPB
instability region can in most cases be explained by the gravity darkening eﬀect. We also discover 13 new HgMn stars in the Galactic
sample of which only one is found in a spectroscopic binary, resulting in a biased and therefore unreliable low binary rate of only 8%.

1. Introduction

While massive stars are important suppliers of chemical and me-
chanical feedback to the interstellar medium (e.g. Langer 2012),
their structure and evolution is not yet well understood. Large
theoretical uncertainties occur already during the early phases,
that have an impact on the further evolution (e.g. Maeder &
Meynet 2000; Ekström et al. 2012; Aerts et al. 2019). To cali-
brate physical processes in these stars, observational constraints
from their interiors are needed. With space asteroseismology,

observed pulsations inside stars provide information about stel-
lar interiors (Aerts 2021). Low-mass stars pulsate with pressure
modes that probe the stellar envelope. They have a similar struc-
ture to that of the Sun, thus similar analysis techniques can be
used as in helioseismology (Christensen-Dalsgaard 2002). On
the other hand, intermediate to massive main-sequence stars (M
∼ 2-25 M(cid:12)) pulsate both in pressure (p) and gravity (g) modes,
either simultaneously (the case of hybrid pulsators) or separately.
Gravity-mode oscillations are most sensitive to physical condi-
tions in the near-core regions of stars with M > 1.3 M(cid:12), and are
therefore ideal to unravel the mechanisms of convective core
boundary mixing, near-core rotation and chemical mixing (see
Bowman 2020 for a review). Many theoretical and observational
studies of single stars or their ensembles have used g-mode pul-
sations to infer internal information such as the proﬁle of the

convective boundary mixing region and the radiative envelope,
the internal rotation rate, and the amount of chemical mixing,
both in slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars and β Cephei (β Cep) stars
(e.g. Miglio et al. 2008; Szewczuk & Daszy´nska-Daszkiewicz
2015; Moravveji et al. 2016; Pedersen et al. 2018; Michielsen
et al. 2019; Mo´zdzierski et al. 2019), and in less massive γ Do-
radus (γ Dor) stars (e.g. Van Reeth et al. 2018; Mombarg et al.
2020; Angelou et al. 2020). These are three classes of pulsat-
ing main-sequence stars with predominantly g-mode pulsations
in γ Dor (1.3-1.9 M(cid:12)) and SPB (3-8 M(cid:12)) stars and p-mode pul-
sations in β Cep stars (8-25 M(cid:12)).

There are not that many asteroseismic studies of massive
stars, as compared to low-mass stars, because long time base,
continuous and high-precision time series are needed to prop-
erly resolve frequencies and identify geometries of g-mode pul-
sations (Bowman 2020). This became possible with the start of
science operations of space missions such as CoRoT (Auvergne
et al. 2009) and Kepler (Borucki et al. 2010). Especially the Ke-
pler mission revolutionised the ﬁeld of g-mode asteroseismol-
ogy with its four-year duration light curves. However, Kepler
was pointed to one ﬁxed ﬁeld of view for its entire nominal
mission duration, where the ﬁeld selection was driven by the
primary science of the mission of detection and characterisa-
tion of exoplanets around solar-like stars. Therefore, not many
massive stars were observed by the mission. The ongoing Tran-
siting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission (Ricker et al.
2015) is observing the whole sky searching for planets around
bright stars, and thereby also targeting O- and B-type stars. The
nominal mission divided the two ecliptic hemispheres into 13
sectors that are each observed for 27 d. The 13 sectors in the
Northern and Southern ecliptic hemispheres overlap near the
poles where one-year long observations are taken. In the South-
ern hemisphere, the TESS continuous viewing zone (CVZ) in-
cludes the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxy which means
that diﬀerent metallicity regimes can be probed. Diﬀerent studies
have demonstrated the diverse variability among OB-type stars
using Kepler/K2 and TESS light curves. Bowman et al. (2019b)
and Burssens et al. (2019) found a number of coherent pulsators
among more than 100 OB-type stars in the K2 mission, and light
curves dominated by stochastic low-frequency variability (SLF)
for the most massive stars and dozens of blue supergiants ob-
served with K2 and TESS. From the ﬁrst two sectors of TESS,
Pedersen et al. (2019) detected and classiﬁed the variability for a
sample of 154 OB-type stars, including 40 LMC targets, show-
ing that 90% have pulsational, binary, rotational or SLF variabil-
ity. Burssens et al. (2020) also found a large diversity of vari-
ability in a sample of OB-type stars observed within the ﬁrst 13
sectors of TESS, and demonstrated the power of coupling TESS
light curves with high-resolution spectroscopy.

Asteroseismic modelling of intermediate-mass stars entails a
number of degeneracies due to strong correlations between the
numerous parameters occurring in stellar models. The addition
of spectroscopic, binarity or astrometric data helps to lift these
degeneracies, reduce uncertainties on the parameters, and sup-
plies information that is required to establish a link between in-
teriors of stars and their atmospheric layers. With this in mind,
many studies in the past decade have focused on obtaining spec-
troscopic parameters for samples of promising pulsating Kepler
stars (e.g. Lehmann et al. 2011; Tkachenko et al. 2012, 2013b,a;
Van Reeth et al. 2015; Niemczura et al. 2015, 2017). During
early phases of the Kepler mission science operations, ground-
based spectroscopy was frequently used in tandem with Kepler
photometry to aid with the photometric classiﬁcation of variable
stars. Eﬀective temperature (Teﬀ) and surface gravity (log g) es-

timates were used to place stars in the Kiel diagram (log g as
a function of Teﬀ) and compare their positions with theoretical
instability strips of diﬀerent types of pulsators, thus conﬁrm-
ing or rejecting the photometric classiﬁcation (e.g. Uytterhoeven
et al. 2011; Balona et al. 2011; Tkachenko et al. 2013a). The
spectroscopic surface measurements were also used to check es-
timates of those parameters determined from photometry (e.g.
Silva Aguirre et al. 2012; Thygesen et al. 2012; Pinsonneault
et al. 2014). The other way around, asteroseismic values of log g
are often more precise than spectroscopic ones and have thus
been used in some studies to better constrain spectroscopic pa-
rameters of stars (Bruntt et al. 2012; Thygesen et al. 2012).

In recent years, detailed asteroseismic modelling of
intermediate-mass stars has made advances by including non-
photometric data. For example, Mombarg et al. (2019) added
spectroscopic measurements of Teﬀ and log g to the forward
modelling of γ Dor stars to lift degeneracies and to estimate
masses and ages of stars. In Mombarg et al. (2020), atomic dif-
fusion in AF-type stars was studied by not only adding spectro-
scopic Teﬀ and log g values to g-mode asteroseismic modelling,
but also by comparing the predicted surface abundances to ob-
servational ones to evaluate models with and without atomic
diﬀusion. Pedersen et al. (2018) studied diﬀerent mixing pro-
ﬁles in more massive B-type stars and emphasised the impor-
tance of adding surface abundances to asteroseismic modelling
to constrain the shape of the mixing proﬁles in radiative zones
of these stars. Pedersen et al. (2021) performed forward astero-
seismic modelling on a sample of 26 SPB stars where they ap-
plied spectroscopic parameters and an astrometric measurement
of the luminosity to delimit the parameter space. Aside from
spectroscopy, binary modelling can also add valuable constraints
to asteroseismic modelling since it can deliver independent es-
timates of the radius and mass with very high precision. John-
ston et al. (2019), for example, used binary information to reduce
parameter uncertainties and correlations between parameters in
the modelling of binaries with g-mode pulsators. Sekaran et al.
(2020, 2021) combined Kepler photometry with high-resolution
optical hermes spectroscopy (Raskin et al. 2011) to perform a de-
tailed asteroseismic study of a γ Dor-type g-mode pulsator in an
eclipsing double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2) system. The
authors demonstrated that it is highly beneﬁcial for asteroseis-
mic modelling to add model-independent information on stellar
mass and radius inferred from binary dynamics.

Various classes of chemically peculiar (CP) stars have been
encountered among intermediate mass B-type stars. One of them
are CP2 or ApBp stars that show overabundances of Sr, Cr and
Eu. For a subset of ApBp stars these overabundances, located in
spots on the stellar surface, can be explained by the presence of
a magnetic ﬁeld (Smith 1996; Gray 2005). ApBp stars are typi-
cally slow rotators and they are not likely to be in (close) binary
systems (Abt & Snowden 1973; Mathys et al. 2020). The other
group are CP3 or HgMn stars which have enhanced abundances
of Hg and Mn (and other elements such as Ga, Sr and Y, Smith
1996). HgMn stars are slow rotators with (cid:10)v sin i(cid:11) ∼ 29 km s−1
(Abt et al. 1972) and have a high binarity rate with spectroscopic
binarity percentages between 50-91% (e.g. Hubrig & Mathys
1995; Schöller et al. 2010). About half of the binaries are found
in SB2 systems, mostly with short orbital periods. Although they
are thought to be non-magnetic CP stars, they show rotational
modulation consistent with spots of overabundant chemical el-
ements on the surface (e.g. Korhonen et al. 2013; Kochukhov
et al. 2021). Unlike for ApBp stars, the origin of these spots in
HgMn stars is not yet fully understood. Possible explanations
are atomic diﬀusion processes in the outer stellar layers (Ale-

Gebruers et al.: Analysis of FEROS spectroscopy for a sample of variable B-type stars with TESS photometry

cian et al. 2011) or maybe weak magnetic ﬁelds (Hubrig et al.
2020). Another cause for the variability seen in HgMn stars,
aside from rotational modulation, are pulsations but not many
pulsating HgMn stars have been detected yet (e.g. Alecian et al.
2009; Kochukhov et al. 2021).

In this paper, we analyse the spectra of 166 B-type stars that
exhibit photometric variability in their TESS light curves, with
the purpose of future combined asteroseismic and spectroscopic
modelling. For the sake of eﬃciency and consistency of the ob-
tained results across the entire stellar sample, we employ the
zeta-Payne (Straumit et al. 2022) machine learning-based spec-
trum analysis algorithm. The method is a generalisation of the
originally proposed The Payne algorithm (Ting et al. 2019) to-
wards the inclusion of a model with an a priori unknown residual
instrumental response function into the parameter vector. This
way, parameters of the residual response function are optimised
along with the atmospheric parameters of the star, thus removing
the need to normalise stellar spectra manually in advance.

In Sect. 2, we discuss the sample selection and observations
of the targets. We describe some improvements made to the spec-
trum reduction pipeline in Sect. 3. The spectroscopic classiﬁca-
tion is presented in Sect. 4 along with a summary of the zeta-
Payne framework and a few tests for the speciﬁc set-up in this
paper. The spectroscopic and photometric results are given in
Sect. 5, while the internal uncertainties of the methodology and a
subsample of peculiar stars are discussed in Sect. 6. This section
also presents the obtained results in the context of the spectro-
scopic Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (Langer & Kudritzki 2014).
We conclude our study in Sect. 7.

2. Sample selection and observations

We selected all the bright targets (stars with V-band magnitudes
below 11.5 mag) in the samples of variable OB-type stars from
Pedersen et al. (2019) and Bowman et al. (2019b). These sam-
ples were constructed following the asteroseismic potential of
OB-type stars as determined from the ﬁrst three TESS sectors
that were available at that time. For the 166 brightest stars, we
obtained spectroscopic observations with the Fibre-fed Extended
Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS, Kaufer et al. 1999) which
is attached to the ESO/MPG 2.2-m telescope at La Silla, Chile.
In an accompanying paper (Serebriakova et al., in prep.), the
spectroscopic analysis of ESO UVES spectra for fainter stars
(V > 10 mag) from the samples of Pedersen et al. (2019) and
Bowman et al. (2019b) will be presented.

FEROS is a high-resolution spectrograph (R ∼ 48 000) that
covers a wavelength range from 3600-9200 Å over 39 orders.
The observations were taken during December 2019 and Febru-
ary 2020. In total 166 objects were observed with a minimum
of two epochs per target (separated by two months), except for
seven targets that were not observable during the second run in
February. The spectra were reduced with the publicly available
Collection of Elemental Routines for Echelle Spectra (CERES,
Brahm et al. 2017)1. This package consists of automated re-
duction pipelines for 13 diﬀerent échelle spectrographs, among
which FEROS. The pipelines are written in Python and comple-
mented with C and Fortran routines to speed-optimise the time
consuming parts. It performs a bias subtraction, correction for
bad columns, background subtraction, order extraction, wave-
length calibration, barycentric correction and a blaze correction.
To achieve the goals of this paper, some changes to the CERES

1 https://github.com/rabrahm/ceres

pipeline were necessary to obtain most optimally extracted 1D
spectra. These changes are described in Sect. 3.

To complement the spectroscopic data within this work and
to classify the dominant variability type of each target, we re-
analysed available 2-min cadence photometry from TESS. We
downloaded the available simple aperture photometry (SAP)
and pre-data search conditioning (PDC-SAP) light curves out-
put from the NASA SPOC pipeline (Jenkins et al. 2016) from
the Mikulsi Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST2). Almost all
bright (V ≤ 14 mag) O and early-B stars observed by TESS were
prioritised for 2-min cadence in at least one sector because of
successful guest investigator proposals3. Yet, some stars fall be-
tween the gaps in the CCDs and cameras, or are located close to
the ecliptic. Cycle 4 of the TESS mission is currently in progress
as of July 2021, which includes the second visit to the northern
ecliptic hemisphere and parts of the ecliptic for the ﬁrst time.

(Almost) all of our targets currently have at least one sec-
tor of TESS data available, which is suﬃcient to classify its
dominant variability. Given that variability classiﬁcation is suﬃ-
cient for this paper, as its focus is on the analysis of the newly-
obtained spectroscopic data for a large number of B-type stars,
we focused our photometric analysis on the longer time spans of
2-min TESS light curves available for each target. We checked
both the available SAP and PDC-SAP light curves to compare
and contrast the impact of instrumental systematics that may be
present in either or both light curve formats. In most cases, the
latter were suﬃcient for variability classiﬁcation. However, we
note that correcting for instrumental eﬀects (for example extract-
ing custom light curves) to derive reliable lists of pulsation fre-
quencies is the subject of future work.

3. Improvements of the CERES pipeline for the

FEROS spectra

The CERES pipeline reduces 25 of the 39 FEROS orders, which
corresponds to the wavelength range 3800-6800 Å, containing
six Balmer lines and suﬃcient metal lines to determine stellar
parameters (Brahm et al. 2017). We made four changes to the
existing CERES pipeline in order to meet our quest for high-
precision spectroscopic parameter determination of our targets.
The ﬁrst two were necessary to remove unphysical artefacts
(hereafter referred to as wiggles) from the spectra and to elim-
inate ‘bumps’ occurring at the edges of the orders. The other
two changes concern an additional function that merges the in-
dividual orders and a method to remove cosmic hits. The orig-
inal CERES pipeline only returns separate orders and not the
fully merged spectrum since the main purpose of the developers
was to determine precise radial velocities (RV) which is possible
from individual orders.

When obtaining reduced spectra with the original CERES
pipeline, we detected wiggles and a gap at certain positions in the
1D spectra (see the arrows in the top panel of Fig. 1). We traced
these features back to bad columns in the 2D frames. The orig-
inal pipeline corrects for bad columns by interpolating among
the good pixels in each row at the positions of the bad pixels.
However, because the orders are skewed, some parts of the bad
columns are assigned too much or too little ﬂux in this way, cre-
ating the observed wiggles in the 1D spectra. Instead of interpo-
lating within each row, we found that almost all the bad columns
disappear when the bias frame is subtracted from the observed

Fig. 1. Top: spectrum of B9V star HD 33244 reduced with the original CERES pipeline. Red and purple arrows indicate the positions of wiggles

science frames. The bias frame contains the same bad columns
as the science frames so when the ﬁrst one is subtracted from the
latter, the excess in ﬂux is removed and the bad columns are no
longer visible in the 2D frames. This is the case for all but one
bad column. Column 1299 is the brightest one present in the 2D
frames and does not disappear by subtracting the bias. For the
pixels in this column we increased the variance by 10 000 such
that they have an extremely small weight and almost no contri-
bution in the extraction process.

The original CERES pipeline corrects for the blaze function
by dividing each individual order by the normalised ﬂat ﬁeld in
that order. The normalised ﬂat ﬁeld is assumed to represent the
blaze function according to Brahm et al. (2017), and is deﬁned as
the ﬂat ﬁeld divided by its maximum in that order. However, we
noticed that this blaze correction induces large intensity jumps
or ‘bumps’ where successive orders overlap (see yellow circles
in the top panel of Fig. 1). When instead the orders are divided
by the non-normalised ﬂat ﬁeld, they connect much better and
bumps are no longer visible (see bottom panel of Fig. 1). There-
fore we changed the blaze correction in CERES to a division of
each spectral order by the non-normalised ﬂat ﬁeld.

The CERES pipeline only outputs the 1D spectrum for in-
dividual orders. While this is ﬁne for RV determinations, for
which the pipeline was designed, we needed the whole spectrum
to perform a spectral analysis. Therefore, we implemented or-
der merging into the code. First we created a uniﬁed wavelength
grid in logarithmic scale that covers the full wavelength range
of all the extracted orders and has a relative step size of 10−5.
This step size is approximately equal to 1/(2R) with R the res-
olution of FEROS (R = 48 000). Each order was then shifted to
the new wavelength grid by linear interpolation. We merged the
orders by taking a weighted sum, with as weight the square of
the signal-to-noise ratio (w = (S/N)2):

where fi is the blaze corrected ﬂux in order i and σ f,i is its un-
certainty. If pure Poisson noise is assumed, (S/N)2
is equal to
i
the number of photons from the star in a certain order so that
the weighted mean in Eq. 1 is just a co-addition of photons over
all orders. This means that in overlapping neighbouring orders,
where part of the photons had ended up in one or the other order,
all photons are added again by Eq. 1.

We added two steps to the pipeline to remove sharp lines
originating from cosmic rays and chip defects. In the ﬁrst step
we only dealt with positive hits due to cosmic hits. At every po-
sition in the spectrum we computed the median ﬂux and standard
deviation within a window of 100 pixels (∼ 5Å). When the dif-
ference between the ﬂux at that point and the median ﬂux was
larger than four times the standard deviation, the ﬂux value was
replaced with the median value. This process was repeated ﬁve
times. The second step also removed negative hits due to chip
defects, but here the method was more conservative to prevent
removing stellar absorption lines. This is especially diﬃcult in
slowly rotating stars that have many narrow absorption lines that
must not be mistaken for cosmic hits. The method is the same as
for the positive cosmic hits, only the window size was changed
to 30 pixels (∼ 1.5Å) and both positive and negative hits were
removed. Although emission lines have been detected in B-type
stars (Wahlgren & Hubrig 2000; Alexeeva et al. 2016), we are
conﬁdent that our cosmic hit removal function does not remove
these real emission lines since they are expected to have the same
width as the absorption lines in the spectrum while only sharp
and narrow features are being removed by our method.

To make a spectroscopic classiﬁcation of the sample, the reduced
spectra were subjected to least-squares deconvolution (LSD; Do-
nati et al. 1997). We produced LSD proﬁles using the method

Gebruers et al.: Analysis of FEROS spectroscopy for a sample of variable B-type stars with TESS photometry

model spectra for log g > 3 dex, while supergiants typically have
log g values between 1 and 3 dex. Therefore it could not be ap-
plied to the spectra of the supergiants. Instead, these 42 stars will
be studied in the complementary paper by Serebriakova et al. (in
prep.) focused on OBA-type supergiant LMC members.

The other group contains 92 stars without clear LPV or hav-
ing variability in metal lines but stable Balmer lines, as well as
six Be stars with Balmer lines in emission. These 98 (Galactic)
stars are further studied in this paper. Among them, we identi-
ﬁed single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1) using the RV de-
terminations from the zeta-Payne. A target was classiﬁed as SB1
system when the RV diﬀerence between any two epochs of that
target is larger than the uncertainties of the RV values. If the RV
diﬀerences are smaller than the uncertainties or when there is
only one spectrum available, the star was assumed to be single.
Twelve targets were found to be SB1 systems and 86 are single
stars. For each of the targets, we shifted all of its spectra to RV
= 0 km s−1 and added them by taking a weighted sum, where the
weight of each epoch is the square of the S/N value of that epoch
computed following the algorithm from Stoehr et al. (2008). We
subsequently used that same algorithm to compute the S/N of the
averaged spectrum; these values are reported in column 3 of Ta-
ble A.2. The number of epochs and binary information are given
in columns 2 and 4 of the same table.

We computed the binary detection probability for all our tar-
gets. We distinguished four diﬀerent observing strategies to ob-
tain the observations required for our study: 1) two observations
were obtained within one week and one observation one month
and a half later, 2) two observations were obtained spread over
two months, 3) four observations were obtained: two during one
week and two collected during another week two months later
and 4) two observations were obtained on consecutive nights and
one observation two months later. Fig. 3 displays the binary de-
tection probabilities in these diﬀerent campaigns. To compute
these probabilities, we ran 1 million Monte Carlo simulations
tuned for each observing strategy. We took a uniform period dis-
tribution in logarithmic space ranging from 1 to 1000 days and
eccentricity values between 0 and 0.95, with all orbits with ec-
centricities lower than 0.03 considered as circular. The mass-
ratio distribution was considered uniform from 0.01 to 1 and the
initial mass for each star was taken between 2 and 5 M(cid:12), that
is, in agreement with their spectral classiﬁcation (Schmidt-Kaler
1982). We adopted a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF, with
α = −2.35) for the primary masses. Our simulations assumed
that the orbits are randomly oriented in the three-dimensional
space, the time of periastron passage is uncorrelated with respect
to the start of the RV campaign, and that the orbital parameters
are uncorrelated. To detect a system as binary, it needs to fulﬁl
the same criteria as the ones we adopted for our analysis.

For orbital periods shorter than 10 days, the probability to
detect binary systems is rather high with a probability of 60% or
higher, whatever the observing strategy used. For systems with
periods between 10 and 100 days, we still reach a detection rate
between 30 and 60%. This rate signiﬁcantly drops for longer-
period systems, and it is almost not possible to detect binary
systems with orbital periods larger than 1000 days.

4.2. Spectrum analysis with the zeta-Payne
We used the zeta-Payne (Straumit et al. 2022) spectrum analy-
sis algorithm to analyse the averaged spectra of the 98 Galactic
single stars or SB1 systems. The zeta-Payne is a machine learn-
ing framework that trains a neural network on a grid of synthetic
spectra to obtain a spectrum interpolator. This interpolator pre-

of Tkachenko et al. (2013c)4. The computation of LSD proﬁles
requires normalised spectra and spectral line masks. Therefore,
we ran each individual spectrum through the zeta-Payne set-up,
which is described in Sect. 4.2, and obtained normalised spectra
from which the response function is removed. The line masks
were computed with the GSSP code (Tkachenko 2015), which
relies on atmosphere models obtained with the LLmodels code
(Shulyak et al. 2004), the radiative transfer code SynthV (Tsym-
bal 1996), and Vienna Atomic Line Database (VALD, Kupka
et al. 1999) atomic data. For each star we computed a GSSP
model for its preliminary Teﬀ and log g value returned by the
zeta-Payne, and we ﬁxed [M/H] to 0 dex.

We identiﬁed SB2 systems as targets for which two compo-
nents could be distinguished in the LSD proﬁles, while in some
cases also revealing diﬀerent relative positions of the spectral
lines of the two components for the diﬀerent epochs of that tar-
get. The LSD proﬁles were also used to detect line proﬁle vari-
ability (LPV), which can have various physical origins, such as
chemical inhomogeneities or pulsations. Examples of LSD pro-
ﬁles for an SB2 system and a star with LPV are shown in Fig. 2.
In total 26 targets were classiﬁed as SB2 systems or as targets
for which it was not clear whether the variability in the LSD
proﬁles is due to binarity or LPV. Some of these systems were
already identiﬁed as (spectroscopic) binaries in SIMBAD. These
26 targets were excluded from the sample since they require the
(simultaneous) analysis of both components, which is not yet
possible with our current method. They are listed as SB2 sys-
tems in Table A.1.

The remaining targets were divided into two groups based
upon the LPV in the diﬀerent epochs of each target. The ﬁrst
group consists of 42 stars with LPV, either in Hα, in all Balmer
lines or also in metal lines. Two of these stars are Be stars with
not only Balmer lines in emission but also metal emission lines.
The other 40 stars are classiﬁed as (blue) supergiants in SIM-
BAD and all of them are members of the LMC. For this type of
star, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) analysis in-
cluding wind physics is required to obtain atmospheric param-
eters. Our current set-up of the zeta-Payne is trained on LTE

in this regime. To improve the performance of the neural net-
work for such complex spectra, the parameter space should be
oversampled with model spectra computed for low v sin i and
low Teﬀ values. The ﬁnal training sample therefore consists of
5000 quasi-randomly spaced model spectra and 5000 additional
random model spectra with Teﬀ and v sin i drawn from the nor-
mal distributions N(6000, 4000) and N(0, 25) respectively. An
overview of the parameter ranges for the whole training grid is
given in Table 1.

All the model spectra were computed within the wavelength
range from 3000 to 10 500 Å and for inﬁnite resolution (no in-
strumental broadening) such that the grid can also be used for
optical spectra from spectrographs other than FEROS. During
the ﬁtting procedure the spectra are convolved to the resolu-
tion of the respective spectrograph by either using a constant
resolution value or a wavelength dependent resolution (the line
spread function, LSF). We used the constant resolution value
of FEROS, because the LSF computed from the ThAr frames
that were taken during the observing run, changes from night to
night. The training of the neural network was done identical to
the procedure described in Straumit et al. (2022), so more infor-
mation can be found in that paper. For every star in the sample,
surface parameters and the RV were derived by ﬁtting model
spectra to the observed spectrum using the neural network inter-
polator, performing a Doppler shift, and minimising the χ2 merit
function. However, the neural network was trained on continuum
normalised spectra while the observed spectra contain compo-
nents from the instrument (the response function), the interstel-
lar medium (ISM) and the Earth’s atmosphere. Each observed
spectrum had to be divided by its response function before it
could be compared to the normalised model spectra. In the ideal
case, the response function of a spectrograph is known and can
be removed from any observed spectrum to obtain only the com-
ponent from the star itself (and some additional features from
the ISM and the Earth’s atmosphere such as telluric lines). This
is attempted by dividing an observed spectrum by a ﬂat-ﬁeld ex-
posure, but some curvature always remains in the spectrum that
is not related to the stellar atmosphere (Gray 2005, Chap. 12).
In practice, the response function is mostly removed by ﬁtting
a spline or a polynomial to manually selected points that are
assumed to be part of the continuum. This is a rather subjec-
tive way of normalising a spectrum and can give diﬀerent results
when it is done by diﬀerent researchers.

In order to minimise subjectivity, we followed Straumit et al.
(2022) and normalised the spectra automatically during the ﬁt-
ting procedure in the zeta-Payne, such that the optimal response
function was determined simultaneously with the best-ﬁtting
surface parameters. We assumed that the response function could
be represented by a Chebyshev polynomial for which we opti-
mised its coeﬃcients (as described in Straumit et al. 2022). The
number of coeﬃcients is a free parameter that had to be ﬁxed
before starting the ﬁtting procedure. Preferably the number is
as small as possible to ensure that no features are introduced
into the spectrum, but it should also be high enough to capture

dicts theoretical ﬂux spectra for an arbitrary set of stellar labels
and can be used to ﬁt any observed spectrum and derive its sur-
face parameters as long as they are within the parameter ranges
of the training sample.

In this paper, the neural network was trained with 1D LTE
synthetic models computed with GSSP. Our choice of the LTE
formalism is well justiﬁed given that the Teﬀ distribution of the
sample stars is found to peak at some 11 500 K, with only one
target being hotter than 20 000 K (cf. Fig. 8). In their recent study
of OBA-type stars in the LAMOST survey, Xiang, Maosheng
et al. (2022) demonstrate the impact of NLTE eﬀects on the spec-
troscopically inferred Teﬀ values to be negligible for stars cooler
than 25 000 K. In particular, the authors show an overall good
consistency between the Kurucz LTE and Potsdam Wolf-Rayet
(PoWR Hainich et al. 2019) NLTE models at Teﬀ (cid:47) 25 000 K
(their Figs. C.1 and C.2), and report a good agreement between
the parameters obtained with the LTE and NLTE models for stars
below that same Teﬀ cut-oﬀ value (their Fig. 11). Instead of using
a regular grid in ﬁve dimensions – one for each of the parame-
ters we want to determine, namely Teﬀ, log g, global metallic-
ity ([M/H]), projected rotational velocity (v sin i) and microtur-
bulent velocity (ξ) – we created a grid that is quasi-randomly
spaced using Sobol numbers (Sobol 1967). It covers the whole
parameter space for main sequence BAF-type stars as listed in
the second column of Table 1, but with fewer grid points than a
regular grid would need and is therefore more feasible to com-
pute. Straumit et al. (2022) point out that, for high-resolution
spectra, the neural network performs worse in regions of the
parameter space with low values of v sin i and temperatures in
the late-A to F-type regime. This is due to the many narrow
spectral lines that have to be resolved by the neural network

the whole shape of the response function. It also depends on the
wavelength range, where generally more coeﬃcients are needed
when a longer wavelength range is used. For our analysis, we
selected a wavelength range from 4000 to 5800 Å because it in-
cludes three Balmer lines (Hβ, Hγ and Hδ) and many metal lines,
but excludes the Hα region that complicates the optimal normal-
isation of FEROS spectra. Since all the response functions of
the FEROS spectra have a similar shape, the same number of
Chebyshev coeﬃcients could be used for all the stars.

We tested the optimal number of Chebyshev coeﬃcients for
a typical FEROS response function by taking ﬁve random stars
from the sample for which we ﬁtted the spectra with 10, 15, 20,
25, 30 and 35 coeﬃcients with the zeta-Payne. For each ﬁt we
computed the χ2 value and plotted those values as a function
of the number of coeﬃcients (see Fig. 4). The χ2 proﬁle con-
verges towards a certain value and this plateau is reached around
25 coeﬃcients. Therefore, we used 25 Chebyshev coeﬃcients to
represent the FEROS response functions.

4.3. Internal uncertainties

We determined the internal uncertainties of the stellar parame-
ters that are inherent to the modelling set-up. We created 1000
artiﬁcial FEROS spectra in the wavelength range from 4000
to 5800 Å, quasi-randomly spaced within the parameter space
but not overlapping with the training sample. Each spectrum
was computed with GSSP, given a random RV shift within
±50 km s−1, and convolved to the resolution of FEROS. A ran-
dom response function was introduced represented by a Cheby-
shev polynomial with 25 coeﬃcients. For every spectrum we got
a noiseless version and a version with S/N = 150, a typical value
of the real FEROS spectra. All the artiﬁcial spectra were anal-
ysed with the ﬁtting routine of the zeta-Payne and the resulting
parameters were compared with their real values. Outliers were
identiﬁed as spectra for which the Teﬀ diﬀerence was larger than
four times the 1σ standard deviation of the Teﬀ diﬀerence dis-
tribution of all 1000 spectra. This is formulated as the reliability
fraction of the neural network (Straumit et al. 2022) and is given
in the last row of Table 2.

be taken into account when determining parameters for the ob-
served FEROS spectra.

Apart from the total internal uncertainties for the full Teﬀ
range of the grid, we also computed the internal uncertainties for
the noiseless spectra in bins of Teﬀ and v sin i. An overview of
this can be found in Table 3 and is plotted in Fig. 5. One of the in-
teresting features in this ﬁgure is the tail of high Teﬀ uncertainties
in the ∼ 9000 K regime. A closer look at the properties of spectra
forming the tail reveals low [M/H] and high v sin i values which
in turn implies apparent dearth of spectral lines of metals. This
signiﬁcant loss of information, where one has to rely exclusively
on the Balmer lines to estimate the Teﬀ-log g pair of parameters,
results in larger uncertainties in Teﬀ and, to a lesser extent, log g
of the star. There is also an increase in absolute uncertainty to-
wards high Teﬀ values, yet relative uncertainties remain at the
level of 2-3%, similar to the lower Teﬀ regime (see Table 3).
We also note scatter in log g for spectra with Teﬀ < 10 000K,
that is for late A- and F-type stars. As discussed in Gebruers
et al. (2021), the log g determination for these stars is degen-
erate with Teﬀ, [M/H] and the continuum normalisation of the
spectrum. Small oﬀsets in the continuum result in large diﬀer-
ences in log g, which explains the larger internal uncertainty in
this Teﬀ bin. The same trends in the internal uncertainties are
reported by Straumit et al. (2022) for APOGEE (infrared) and
BOSS (optical) spectra.

4.4. Effect of the selected wavelength region

The atmospheric parameters of the main sequence stars in our
sample were derived using the spectral wavelength range 4000-
5800 Å. To test whether the analysis of a longer or shorter wave-
length range has any eﬀect on the obtained parameters, we se-
lected six stars distributed over the parameter space and applied
the zeta-Payne on three diﬀerent wavelength ranges. The wave-
length ranges are: 3870-6750 Å (Hα, Hβ, Hγ, Hδ, and H(cid:15)), 3870-
5800 Å (Hβ, Hγ, Hδ, and H(cid:15)), and 4200-5800 Å (Hβ and Hγ).
For each of these wavelength ranges, we computed the diﬀerence
in parameters with those obtained from the original wavelength
range (4000-5800 Å). This is shown in Fig. 6. All the values lie
within the internal uncertainties from Table 2. This demonstrates
that the choice of wavelength region has no statistically signif-
icant eﬀect on the surface parameters when the internal uncer-
tainties are taken into account.

Using only the remaining spectra without the outliers, we
computed the internal uncertainty for each parameter as the
mean diﬀerence between the real values and the ones obtained
with the zeta-Payne. These uncertainties for noiseless spectra
and for spectra with S/N = 150 are given in Table 2, and should

We noticed that the uncertainties on the surface parameters
increase with longer wavelength regions. There is also a trend of
increasing log g when a longer wavelength region is analysed,
although all values are still within the internal uncertainties. This
is caused by the normalisation of the spectrum, which becomes

more diﬃcult when more parts of the spectrum are included.
Especially when Hα is included, a wavelength range contain-
ing multiple telluric lines is covered and the zeta-Payne cannot
model these. For the stars in Fig. 6, we found that for longer
wavelength regions, the wings of the Balmer lines get more
broadened than when shorter wavelength regions are analysed
with the zeta-Payne. This is demonstrated in Fig. 7 and shows
that our normalisation approach with a Chebyshev polynomial
of 25 coeﬃcients is not optimised to normalise a spectrum ex-
tended to Hα or to H(cid:15), and that the deterioration in normalisation
of the Balmer wings gets compensated by preferring a model
with higher log g. Additional tests for the number of Chebyshev
coeﬃcients and methods to remove tellurics are needed to get a
better normalisation in each speciﬁc wavelength range. Here we
decided to limit our analysis to the 4000-5800 Å region since not
that much information is added by extending to H(cid:15) and normal-
isation becomes much more uncertain when including Hα.

best ﬁtting model does not fully correspond to the observed spec-
trum. In 13 of those cases, the observed spectrum contains more
absorption lines than the predicted spectrum. These stars were
identiﬁed as chemically peculiar, and speciﬁcally HgMn stars,
which are further discussed in Sect. 6.1. Three stars (HD 40435,
HD 45527, and HD 63928) show strong LPV in their spectra
and four other ones (CPD-60 944B, HD 32493, HD 59426, and
HD 6783) have very narrow spectral lines with strongly variable
depths between diﬀerent epochs. These stars are indicated as
‘LPV’ and ‘LPV*’, respectively, in Table A.2. From the TESS
light curves discussed in the following section, we ﬁnd that
these seven stars are rotational variables. This means that they
are likely chemically peculiar (that is, ApBp stars), which ex-
plains the limited agreement with the best ﬁtting model spectra.
In many of these stars Cr is overabundant, conﬁrming the chem-
ically peculiar nature. An in-depth chemical abundance analysis
is beyond the scope of this work.

5. Analysis results

5.1. Spectroscopy

The results for the 98 stars analysed with zeta-Payne are given in
Table A.2. The statistical uncertainties inferred from using zeta-
Payne (σ) and those that include the internal uncertainty (σi) are
also provided. We advise to use the latter value since they are
more representative for the typical precision with which the sur-
face parameters of B-type stars can be derived. The distributions
of the surface parameters are shown in Fig. 8. Most of the stars
have parameters indicative of late B-type, with temperatures in
the range 10 000-14 000 K. There are some cooler stars (early A-
type) in the sample and a few hotter stars with Teﬀ > 16 000 K.
From the log g distribution it can be seen that the majority are
main-sequence stars. However, there are six stars with log g <
3.5 dex indicating that these are near the end or just beyond
the main sequence. The v sin i values are fairly uniformly dis-
tributed within 0-350 km s−1 and [M/H] shows a normal distri-
bution around solar value with mean of (−0.12 ± 0.27) dex. We
note that the metallicity [M/H] refers in our case to all chemical
elements heavier than helium.

All the ﬁts with the zeta-Payne were visually inspected. For
20 stars we noticed that the model predicted by the zeta-Payne as

5.2. Variability classiﬁcation from TESS Photometry

We analysed both SAP and PDC-SAP light curves independently
for all stars to gauge the possible eﬀect of systematics, and we
checked that the allocated aperture mask and background pixels
by the SPOC pipeline are reasonable. It has been shown that,
for example, SAP light curves are preferable in the identiﬁca-
tion and analysis of bright eclipsing binaries (see e.g. South-
worth et al. 2020, 2021). For each star, we calculated the am-
plitude spectrum of its SAP and PDC-SAP light curves using a
discrete Fourier transform (DFT; Kurtz 1985) up to the Nyquist
frequency, which for the 2-min TESS data is 360 d−1. A high
diversity and incidence of photometric variability occurs in mas-
sive stars, with common causes including pulsations, rotational
modulation, winds and binarity (Pedersen et al. 2019; Bowman
et al. 2019a,b, 2020; Burssens et al. 2020). Based on a group of
expert classiﬁers, we visually inspected the light curves and am-
plitude spectra and determined the dominant variability type(s),
which is included in Table A.1.

Of particular interest are stars pulsating in coherent p and/or
g modes for follow-up asteroseismic modelling (e.g. Moravveji
et al. 2015, 2016; Szewczuk & Daszy´nska-Daszkiewicz 2018;
Szewczuk et al. 2022; Pedersen et al. 2021), (pulsating) eclips-
ing binaries (e.g. Tkachenko et al. 2020; Sekaran et al. 2020,

2021) and stars with SLF variability caused by gravity waves
(e.g. Bowman et al. 2019b, 2020). A full list of all variability
types used in this work, which are not mutually exclusive, in-
clude:

– rot: rotational modulation;
– SPB: slowly pulsating B star (i.e. predominantly g-mode pul-

sations);

– const: constant star (i.e. no signiﬁcant variability);
– EB: eclipsing binary;
– EV: ellipsoidal variable;
– β Cep: early-B star (i.e. predominantly p-mode pulsations);
– δ Sct: A- and early-F star with p- and g-mode pulsations;
– SLF: stochastic low-frequency variability;

Stars for which the variability type is also assigned a question
mark (?) have a tentative classiﬁcation. Also, in some cases, the
inferred Teﬀ and log g values from our spectroscopic analysis
were used to separate, for example, δ Sct and β Cep pulsators,
which can have similar amplitude spectra.

We show the TESS light curves and amplitude spectra of
four example stars in Fig. 9 to demonstrate the power of in-
cluding TESS light curves in our analysis. First, is the SPB star
HD 33599 (TIC 55295028), which has the typical signatures of
multi-periodic g modes appearing in distinct groups in its am-
plitude spectrum (Kurtz et al. 2015; Van Beeck et al. 2021).
Its light curve also has signatures of outbursts and hence it is
a candidate pulsating Be star. We also note that we have iden-
tiﬁed HD 33599 as an SB2 system with many emission lines
in its spectra, which makes it interesting to follow-up spec-
troscopically and understand the nature of its companion and
evolutionary origin (see e.g. Shenar et al. 2020; Bodensteiner
et al. 2020). Second, is the SPB / β Cep hybrid star HD 49193
(TIC 167523976), which has v sin i (cid:39) 40 km s−1 and Teﬀ (cid:39)
21 000 K. It is the hottest star in our sample and is located close
to the cool edge of the β Cep instability region. Third is the
EB system AN Dor (TIC 220430912), which was recently re-
visited by Southworth & Bowman (2022) to derive masses and
radii from archival RVs and new TESS light curves. Fourth, is

HD 40435 (TIC 31313111) which has the characteristic double-
wave light curve and harmonic-series in its amplitude spectrum
typical of rotation modulation (see e.g. Bowman et al. 2018). We
identiﬁed LPV in this star’s spectra that is likely associated with
a ApBp nature.

As a vast improvement over previous studies that utilised
short TESS light curves, our re-classiﬁcation has the major ad-
vantage of improved frequency resolution from long-term TESS
light curves. Similar to previous work, we ﬁnd a high variabil-
ity fraction (> 90%) in the TESS light curves of our sample. As
mentioned previously, we do not extract pulsation, binary or ro-
tation frequencies for follow-up modelling, as such an endeavour
requires custom light curves and is the subject of future work.
Our work has allowed us to rank the most promising stars with
reliable spectroscopy and clear signatures of binarity and/or pul-
sations to follow-up with detailed seismic modelling.

6. Discussion

6.1. Newly discovered HgMn stars

Thirteen of the main sequence stars in our sample analysed with
the zeta-Payne were found to be new HgMn stars. We opti-
mised the Hg and Mn abundances of the 13 stars to conﬁrm
their HgMn classiﬁcation. The wavelength range has been ex-
tended to 3930 Å in the blue part of the spectrum to include the
Hg ii3984 spectral line. The diﬀerences between the observed and
the model spectra around the Hg and Mn lines disappear when
the abundances of these elements are optimised in the models
(left versus right panels of Figs. 10 and 11). For some stars, such
as HD 57808, there are still some features present in the resid-
uals after optimising for Hg and Mn. This is probably caused
by overabundances of other elements such as Y, but a detailed
abundance analysis is beyond the scope of this paper.

From the TESS light curves we ﬁnd that all 13 HgMn stars
exhibit rotational modulation and none of them are pulsators. For
a few targets also line proﬁle variability is found in the spectra
(this is indicated in column 4 of Table A.2). Interestingly, only

one of them is found in a SB1 binary: HD 44247. This would
result in a binarity rate of only 8% (without correcting for obser-
vational biases) as opposed to what is found in other studies. Our
observational biases include but are not limited to: an intentional
bias against binary stars at the very early stage of the sample se-
lection, exclusion of all stars that were nevertheless identiﬁed as
SB2 binary systems in our sample prior to its detailed spectro-
scopic analysis based on the obtained FEROS spectra, and our
ability to detect (especially long-period) binaries is limited by
the number of acquired epochs (two in most cases), the sepa-
ration of some two months between them, and the S/N in the
obtained individual epoch spectra. This last bias is represented
by the binary detection probabilities quoted in Sect. 4.1. There-
fore, the above-quoted observed binary rate among HgMn stars
in our sample is unreliable.

None of these 13 stars have been classiﬁed as HgMn stars
before, but µ Men was found to have an overabundance of Si
(Houk & Cowley 1975) and CPD-60 944A has been classiﬁed as
an α2 CVn star with Si overabundance by Bernhard et al. (2015).

6.2. (Spectroscopic) Hertzsprung-Russell diagram

The stars from Table A.2 are plotted in a spectroscopic
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (sHRD) in Fig. 12 in which the or-
dinate axis is deﬁned as log (T 4
eﬀ/g). In the top panel, the stars are
colour-coded following their spectroscopic classiﬁcation, while
on the bottom the symbols represent diﬀerent photometric vari-
ability classes. Typical errors are shown, both for the uncertain-
ties obtained from the zeta-Payne and when the internal uncer-
tainties are taken into account. We used the non-rotating MESA
evolutionary tracks for solar metallicity and an exponential core
overshoot of fov = 0.02, and the g-mode instability region from
Burssens et al. (2020) to situate the stars in the sHRD. Most stars
are intermediate-mass stars on the main sequence with masses
around 2.5-4 M(cid:12). There are however two to six stars, depending

on which errors are taken into account, that seem to have evolved
beyond the end of the main sequence.

We also included Fig. 13 which shows the same stars in the
HRD, with luminosities calculated based on their Gaia G-band
magnitudes, Gaia eDR3 photogeometric distances from Bailer-
Jones et al. (2021), reddening values from the SFD dust map
(Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011) and bolometric corrections calcu-
lated with the prescriptions from Pedersen et al. (2020). Apart
from the g-mode instability region from Burssens et al. (2020)
we also plotted the blue edge of the δ Sct instability strip from
Dupret et al. (2005). Most of the stars classiﬁed as ‘SPB’ or
‘SPB?’ lie within the SPB instability strip. A large part of the
sample is located outside of the SPB and δ Sct instability regions.
This includes constant stars and stars with rotational modulation,
but also 10 pulsators. We have also added to Fig. 13 stars from
the recent work by Sharma et al. (2022). These authors studied
pulsating B-type stars in the Scorpio-Centaurus association us-
ing TESS light curves and also found pulsators below the SPB
instability strip. Low-frequency pulsations in B-type stars cooler
than the red edge of the SPB instability region have been noticed
before. Salmon et al. (2014) claimed that these are fast rotating
SPB stars that are seen equator-on and due to gravity darkening
they appear cooler and fainter than if they would be observed
pole-on. A similar explanation is given for high-frequency pul-
sators found in the literature between the red edge of the β Cep
instability strip and the blue edge of the δ Sct instability strip,
although it is also possible that these are binaries or misclassi-
ﬁed stars that are actually variable due to rotational modulation
(Balona et al. 2015, 2016).

In our sample there are eight stars classiﬁed as SPB that are
situated below the SPB instability strip and that have g-mode fre-
quencies higher than what is normally expected for these stars.
These stars are HD 45835, θ Ret A, κ Men, HD 49531, µ Pic,
HD 47478, 29 Dor, and HD 37027, and none of them are spec-
troscopic binaries. µ Pic, 29 Dor and HD 37027 are known to be

Be stars. We did not include the cores of the Balmer lines in the
spectral analysis for Be stars since they are in emission. There-
fore the Teﬀ value which is derived from the Balmer lines might
be subject to large uncertainties. θ Ret A is a relatively slow ro-
tator with v sin i = 44 ± 13 km s−1, but is situated relatively close
to the red edge of the SPB instability strip. The other seven
stars are rapid rotators and might thus be fast rotating SPB stars
seen equator-on as explained by Salmon et al. (2014). Their high
g-mode frequencies can be explained by fast rotation that has

shifted their g-mode frequencies as observed in an inertial frame
into a relatively high-frequency regime. Such an astrophysical
interpretation has been proposed previously for bright SPB and
Be stars observed from ground-based data (Aerts et al. 1999; De
Cat & Aerts 2002; Aerts & Kolenberg 2005; Saesen et al. 2010,

space photometry (Neiner et al. 2009; Diago et al. 2009), and
Kepler/K2 space photometry (Pápics et al. 2017; White et al.
2017; Pedersen et al. 2021; Szewczuk et al. 2021). In fast ro-
tating stars major frequency shifts are indeed expected for pro-
grade and retrograde sectoral modes (that is, modes with equal
angular degree l and azimuthal wavenumber |m|) in the gravito-
inertial regime. This is the regime where g-mode oscillations are
restored by both buoyancy and the Coriolis acceleration together
(Townsend 2005; Salmon et al. 2014; Saio et al. 2017; Aerts et al.
2019). Our spectroscopic results and interpretation are fully in
agreement with the ﬁndings by Gaia Collaboration et al. (2022)
based on the Gaia DR3 time-series photometry.

Because of the rapid rotation of these SPB stars shown by
large v sin i values inferred from our FEROS spectroscopy, their
apparently too low Teﬀ relative to the SPB instability region are
likely to be due to the gravity darkening phenomenon. This phe-
nomenon results from the variation of Teﬀ with local gravity
on the surface of a non-spherical star (von Zeipel 1924) and
therefore implies a lower Teﬀ at the equator than at the pole
of a rapidly rotating star. As is recently demonstrated in Fabry
et al. (2022, and private communication), the variation of Teﬀ of
a typical rapidly rotating B-type star amounts to about 5% in the
course of its main-sequence evolution. This Teﬀ variation from
stellar pole to equator can explain the apparent temperature oﬀ-
set from the red edge of the SPB instability strip in the HRD for
all but three stars. The stars for which gravity darkening is not
suﬃcient to place them within the SPB instability strip are two
Be stars HD 37027 and 29 Dor, and the star HD 47478. However,
the 5% Teﬀ diﬀerence derived in Fabry et al. (2022) is based on
MESA models which are limited to 1D approximations. A 2D
study with the ESTER code (Bouchaud et al. 2020) has shown
that for the A7-type star Altair the temperature diﬀerence be-
tween equator and pole amounts to approximately 2000 K. Thus
5% is only a lower limit and gravity darkening eﬀects can be
higher when the proper 2D structure of fast rotators is taken into
account instead of 1D approximations.

We also ﬁnd four seemingly p-mode pulsators (identiﬁed as
δ Sct stars based on their TESS light curves exhibiting pulsation
frequencies above ∼ 4 d−1) in between the β Cep and δ Sct in-
stability regions (HD 44533, HD 55478, HD 67420, and η Phe).
These 4 stars are all fast rotators, and HD 44533 and η Phe are Be
stars. They are probably misclassiﬁed as δ Sct stars, just as the
high-frequency mode near ∼ 4 d−1 of the rapidly rotating SPB
pulsator HD 43317 was initially thought to be a p mode (Pápics
et al. 2012) while it actually concerns a rotationally shifted retro-
grade quadrupole mode (Buysschaert et al. 2018). In the case of
the Be stars, their derived surface parameters are uncertain due
to their fast rotation and circumstellar disk.

6.3. Multiple linear regression

We looked for correlations between all ﬁve spectroscopic param-
eters and the luminosity (L) via backward multiple linear regres-
sion. This was done by taking one of these six parameters as
the dependent variable and performing a multiple linear regres-
sion with the other ﬁve parameters as independent variables. We
computed the coeﬃcient of determination (R2) to determine how
well the set of independent variables could predict the dependent
variable, where R2 = 1 would mean a perfect ﬁt. For each of the
independent variables we then checked if they were signiﬁcant in
this relation by doing a t-test. If the p-value from this t-test was
above 0.05 the variable was assumed insigniﬁcant. The multiple
linear regression was then repeated in the same way but without
the least signiﬁcant variable until only signiﬁcant variables re-

mained. The relations we found from this analysis are given in
Table 4.

In the ﬁrst three models log L, Teﬀ, log g and [M/H] are
related to each other. These are well-known relations expected
from standard stellar structure and evolution theory. The fourth
relation links ξ to log L, Teﬀ, v sin i and [M/H]. It suggests a de-
crease of ξ with increasing luminosity within our sample. This
is in contradiction with the expectation of turbulent velocity
ﬁelds getting larger as the log g (luminosity) value of star de-
creases (increases) (e.g. Gray 2005). This latter interpretation is
supported by observational studies of single stars (e.g. Hunter
et al. 2008) and binary systems (e.g. Tkachenko et al. 2014), as
well as by theoretical studies of sub-surface convective zones
in intermediate- and high-mass stars (e.g. Cantiello et al. 2009).
We currently do not have a good physical interpretation of the
(weak) opposite trend we found but we speculate it may have a
methodological explanation in that ξ in B-type stars cannot be
reliably inferred from the global ﬁtting procedure of their entire
optical spectra. Instead, one might need to focus on a detailed
analysis of carefully selected spectral lines that are sensitive to
ξ, such as the Si iii triplet at 4552 Å, 4567 Å, and 4574 Å and/or
He i lines in the optical part of the spectrum. This is diﬀerent
from cooler stars with many metal lines for which ξ can be de-
termined from the entire spectrum since ξ values from all ele-
ment lines, including possible wrong values from lines that are
less sensitive to ξ, are averaged out.

We also noticed by eye a trend of decreasing v sin i with age
in Fig. 13, especially for stars with a mass below 4 M(cid:12). However,
by performing a linear regression analysis for v sin i and stellar
age, which we obtained by interpolating the MESA evolutionary
tracks at the positions of the sample stars, we concluded that this
correlation is not statistically signiﬁcant (R2 = 0.02 and R2 =
0.04 for M< 4 M(cid:12)).

7. Conclusions

We have analysed high-resolution FEROS spectra of a sample
of 166 variable stars identiﬁed using TESS space photometry.
Our follow-up spectroscopic data has been reduced with the
CERES pipeline, to which we added four new capabilities to
obtain smooth reduced normalised spectra without artiﬁcial fea-
tures and cosmic hits.

We have determined surface parameters with the zeta-Payne
framework for all Galactic single stars and SB1 systems in the
sample, excluding SB2 systems and supergiants in the LMC
galaxy. Apart from the uncertainties deduced with the zeta-
Payne, the internal uncertainties inherent to the neural network
and ﬁtting approach were also taken into account. It was shown
that, within the internal uncertainties, the parameters are not af-
fected by the wavelength region that is analysed. If the neural
network used in this paper is applied to longer wavelength re-
gions, the number of coeﬃcients for the Chebyshev polynomial
representing the response function should be optimised for the
respective wavelength range. Overall, in the considered wave-
length interval from 4000 Å to 5800 Å and with 25 Chebyshev
coeﬃcients representing the residual response function of the in-
strument, the estimated internal uncertainties amount to some
3% and 5% in Teﬀ and v sin i, respectively, and ∼ 0.1 dex in
[M/H] and log g. These values give an upper limit on the ac-
tual parameter uncertainties of the sample stars and reach the
level required for high-precision asteroseismic modelling. For
this, the parameter uncertainties are ideally as small as possi-
ble but should deﬁnitely be below ∼ 3% in Teﬀ, 5-10% in v sin i

and ∼ 0.1 dex in log g and for individual abundances (Moravveji
et al. 2016; Michielsen et al. 2021; Mombarg et al. 2022). To
obtain better constraints on the spectroscopic parameters, in-
formation from diﬀerent data sources should be combined and
analysed together. For example Gaia parallaxes and magnitudes
can help constrain the otherwise degenerate parameters Teﬀ and
log g. This is however beyond the scope of this paper and we
leave this endeavour for future work.

We have found that 13 of the stars in the sample are chem-
ically peculiar HgMn stars. The best-ﬁtting spectra returned by
the zeta-Payne framework do not ﬁt well the observed spectra
of these stars, speciﬁcally in spectral windows that contain lines
of Hg, Mn, Y, and some other chemical elements. Our ad-hoc
abundance analysis of several chemical elements in the spec-
tra of these HgMn stars with the GSSP software package re-

vealed strong overabundances, conﬁrming the peculiar nature of
the stars.

The spectroscopic values and luminosities computed from
Gaia eDR3 data were used to place the stars in a spectroscopic
and classical HRD. In these diagrams, eight stars classiﬁed as
SPB with relatively high g-mode frequencies are located below
the (non-rotating) SPB instability region. In all cases the location
and variability of these stars can plausibly be explained by their
fast rotation, which is expected to signiﬁcantly aﬀect the insta-
bility regions of early-type stars (see Szewczuk & Daszy´nska-
Daszkiewicz 2017) and shift their observed g-mode frequencies
into the high-frequency regime. Therefore, we conclude to have
found spectroscopic evidence of a group of fast rotating g-mode
B-type pulsators monitored by TESS, covering the area between
the SPB instability strip and the blue edge of the δ Sct strip. For
all but three stars, the lower temperatures relative to the SPB

instability strip obtained for these stars could be related to the
gravity darkening eﬀect.

The multiple linear regression analysis involving ﬁve spec-
troscopic parameters and stellar luminosity revealed well-known
relations between log L, Teﬀ, log g and [M/H] of the star as pre-
dicted by stellar evolution theory. A somewhat unexpected result
is the weak negative relation found between log L and ξ which
we attribute to our methodology of inferring ξ from the entire
optical spectrum instead of selecting speciﬁc lines sensitive to ξ.
Our spectrum ﬁtting approach with the current neural net-
work trained on LTE GSSP models is not suitable for the analy-
sis of the spectra of supergiants. This will only be possible when
NLTE models with possibility to include physics of stellar winds
are used to train the neural network. Similarly, it is not yet pos-
sible to analyse SB2 systems with this version of the zeta-Payne
since this requires the analysis of either their composite or disen-
tangled spectra. Analysis of the composite spectra of SB2 bina-
ries is challenging and typically associated with large uncertain-
ties in the inferred atmospheric parameters of both binary com-
ponents (see, e.g. Tkachenko 2015). On the other hand, analysis
of the disentangled spectra is as precise as spectrum analysis of
spectra of single stars, provided a uniform orbital phase cover-
age is achieved for the SB2 system in consideration (see, e.g.
Hadrava 1995; Ilijic et al. 2004). Therefore, detailed analysis of
the spectra of evolved supergiants and of SB2 binary systems
requires a dedicated eﬀort and is beyond the scope of this paper.
