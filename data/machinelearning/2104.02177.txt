ABSTRACT
We present a new catalog of 9,318 Lyα emitter (LAE) candidates at z = 2.2, 3.3, 4.9, 5.7, 6.6, and
7.0 that are photometrically selected by the SILVERRUSH program with a machine learning tech-
nique from large area (up to 25.0 deg2) imaging data with six narrowband ﬁlters taken by the Subaru
Strategic Program with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC SSP) and a Subaru intensive program, Cosmic Hy-
drOgen Reionization Unveiled with Subaru (CHORUS). We construct a convolutional neural network
that distinguishes between real LAEs and contaminants with a completeness of 94% and a contamina-
tion rate of 1%, enabling us to eﬃciently remove contaminants from the photometrically selected LAE
candidates. We conﬁrm that our LAE catalogs include 177 LAEs that have been spectroscopically
identiﬁed in our SILVERRUSH programs and previous studies, ensuring the validity of our machine
learning selection. In addition, we ﬁnd that the object-matching rates between our LAE catalogs and
our previous results are ≃ 80–100% at bright NB magnitudes of . 24 mag. We also conﬁrm that
the surface number densities of our LAE candidates are consistent with previous results. Our LAE
catalogs will be made public on our project webpage.

1. INTRODUCTION
Large panoramic surveys over cosmological volumes
such as the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey
(Aihara et al. 2018) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES;
Abbott et al. 2018) are providing massive multiwave-
length data sets for unprecedentedly large numbers of
astronomical sources. Such big data are key to under-
standing galaxy formation and evolution, allowing us to
investigate statistical properties of high-z galaxies (Ono
et al. 2018; Harikane et al. 2018a; Ouchi et al. 2018;
Konno et al. 2018; Stevans et al. 2018; Guarnieri et al.
2019: Adams et al. 2020; Moutard et al. 2020) and pin-
point very rare interesting structures and objects such
as galaxy overdensities (Toshikawa et al. 2018; Ito et al.
2019; Higuchi et al. 2019; Harikane et al. 2019), very
luminous Lyα emitters (LAEs) and Lyα blobs (Shibuya
et al. 2018a; Songaila et al. 2018; Kikuta et al. 2019;
Zhang et al. 2020; Taylor et al. 2020; see also the recent
review of Ouchi et al. 2020).
In the near future, fur-
ther signiﬁcant progress is expected to be made by next
generation telescopes such as Vera C. Rubin Observa-
tory (VRO), Euclid, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space
Telescope.

One of the fundamental problems in analyzing such big
data is that the amount of obtained data can be too large
to handle. For example, in our last LAE search based on
the HSC survey data (Shibuya et al. 2018a), we have con-
ducted visual inspection of the photometrically selected
candidates to remove contaminants in a similar way to
previous studies (e.g., Ouchi et al. 2008; Ouchi et al.
2010). However, due to the very large area of the HSC
survey, it took about two person-months to complete the
visual inspection task, suggesting that it could be almost
impossible to obtain scientiﬁc results in a timely manner
by taking advantage of big data obtained by future large
surveys with reasonable human and computational re-
sources.

Recently, advances in machine learning techniques
have revolutionized the ﬁeld of image recognition and
shown a wide variety of successful applications (Lecun
et al. 2015). Because observational astronomical studies
also utilize imaging data sets, machine learning methods
are becoming prevalent in astronomy (Baron 2019), such
as for source detections (Vafaei Sadr et al. 2019; Burke
et al. 2019), galaxy morphological classiﬁcations and
measurements (Dieleman et al. 2015; Huertas-Company
et al. 2015; Dom´ınguez S´anchez et al. 2018; Martin et al.
2020; Hausen & Robertson 2020; Cheng et al. 2020;
Ghosh et al. 2020; Tohill et al. 2020; see also, Tadaki
et al. 2020), photometric redshift estimates (Hoyle 2016;
D’Isanto & Polsterer 2018; Pasquet et al. 2019), grav-
itationally lensed image searches (Hezaveh et al. 2017;
Lanusse et al. 2018; Schaefer et al. 2018; Jacobs et al.
2019; He et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020; Canameras et al.
2020; Huang et al. 2020b), extremely metal-poor galaxy
searches (Kojima et al. 2020), transient source detec-
tions (Morii et al. 2016; Parfeni et al. 2020), light curve
classiﬁcations (Charnock & Moss 2017; Pasquet-Itam &
Pasquet 2018; Shallue & Vanderburg 2018; Takahashi
et al. 2020), optical depth reconstructions of Lyα forest
absorption (Huang et al. 2020a), stellar spectrum clas-
siﬁcations (Traven et al. 2017; Buder et al. 2018), and
anomaly detections (Giles & Walkowicz 2019; Ichinohe

& Yamada 2019; ˇCotar et al. 2021; D’Addona et al. 2020;
Lochner & Bassett 2020). Convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) are frequently adopted for image classiﬁcation
problems as well as various other computer vision related
tasks such as image segmentation and object recognition.
Similar to other machine learning techniques, CNNs are
trained to learn how to directly extract representative
features from imaging data and to make intelligent judge-
ments or estimates.

In this work, we apply machine learning in the form
of CNNs to image classiﬁcations between high-z LAEs
and contaminants to eﬃciently construct samples of LAE
candidates at z = 2.2, 3.3, 4.9, 5.7, 6.6, and 7.0 based on
the HSC imaging data obtained by the Subaru Strategic
Program (HSC SSP; Aihara et al. 2018; see also Miyazaki
et al. 2012; Miyazaki et al. 2018; Komiyama et al. 2018;
Kawanomoto et al. 2018; Furusawa et al. 2018) as well as
a Subaru intensive program, Cosmic HydrOgen Reioniza-
tion Unveiled with Subaru (CHORUS; Inoue et al. 2020;
see also Itoh et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2020). This pa-
per is included in a series of papers on LAEs based on
the HSC SSP survey, Systematic Identiﬁcation of LAEs
for Visible Exploration and Reionization Research Using
Subaru HSC (SILVERRUSH; Ouchi et al. 2018; Shibuya
et al. 2018a; Shibuya et al. 2018b; Konno et al. 2018;
Harikane et al. 2018b; Inoue et al. 2018; Higuchi et al.
2019; Harikane et al. 2019; Kakuma et al. 2019; H. Goto
et al. in prep.; S. Kikuchihara et al. in prep.). The ma-
jor improvements from our previous work are the advent
of a new narrowband (NB) ﬁlter, N B387, and deeper
depths of broadband (BB) data, as well as a compilation
of results from four NB data of N B387, N B527, N B718,
and N B973 taken by the CHORUS program. Our new
SILVERRUSH LAE catalogs based on new HSC SSP and
CHORUS data with the aid of the machine learning tech-
nique will be made public on our project webpage.1

This paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we
describe our HSC SSP and CHORUS data, and photo-
metric selections for high-z LAE candidates based on
multiwavelength catalogs with HSC NB and BB data.
Our machine learning selection is described in Section 3,
and the constructed LAE catalogs and their statistical
properties are presented in Section 4. A summary is de-
scribed in Section 5. In this paper, we use magnitudes
in the AB system (Oke & Gunn 1983) and assume a ﬂat
universe with Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, and H0 = 70 km s−1
Mpc−1.

2. DATA AND PHOTOMETRIC SELECTION
We use data products of the on-going HSC SSP sur-
vey that were obtained between 2014 March and 2018
January (Aihara et al. 2019). Speciﬁcally, we use the
internal data release of S18A, which is basically identi-
cal to the version of Public Data Release 2.2 The HSC
survey consists of three layers: Ultra-deep (UD), Deep
(D), and Wide. Among these three layers, the UD (D)
layer is covered with two (three) NB ﬁlters of (N B387,)
N B816, and N B921 that are designed to eﬃciently iden-
tify emission line sources, as well as ﬁve BB ﬁlters of g,
r, i, z, and y. Thus, in this study, we use the HSC
SSP data for the UD and D layers. The basic properties

of the limiting magnitudes.

of the N B387, N B816, and N B921 ﬁlters are summa-
rized in Table 1 and their transmission curves are shown
in Figure 1.3 The UD layer has two ﬁelds: UD-SXDS
and UD-COSMOS. The D layer consists of four ﬁelds:
D-SXDS, D-COSMOS, D-ELAIS-N1, and D-DEEP2-3.
The observed areas with the NBs are shown in Table 2.
In addition, we use HSC NB data taken by the CHO-
RUS program between 2017 January and 2018 March
(Inoue et al. 2020). In the CHORUS program, the COS-
MOS ﬁeld in the UD layer is covered with four NB ﬁlters
of N B387, N B527, N B718, and N B973, as well as an
intermediate ﬁlter, IB945. In this study, we use these
NB data to eﬃciently select LAE candidates. The ba-
sic properties of these NB ﬁlters are also presented in

Table 1 and their transmission curves are also shown in
Figure 1. The eﬀective survey area of the NB data are
summarized in Table 3.

These HSC data were reduced with hscPipe 6.7, which
exploits codes from the VRO software pipeline (Bosch
et al. 2018; see also Axelrod et al. 2010; Juri´c et al. 2017;
Ivezi´c et al. 2019). Full details of the HSC SSP survey
and the CHORUS program such as observations and data
reduction are described in Aihara et al. (2019) (see also
Aihara et al. 2018) and Inoue et al. (2020), respectively.
Note that we correct a systematic oﬀset in the zero-point
magnitude of the N B387 data by subtracting 0.45 mag,
following the previous studies (Liang et al. 2020; Inoue
et al. 2020).

To photometrically select LAE candidates based on NB
color excess features, we create multiwavelength catalogs
of NB-detected sources in the HSC data. We use the

blue, green, yellow, orange, magenta, and red curves correspond to
the N B387, N B527, N B718, N B816, N B921, and N B973 ﬁlters,
respectively. The black curves represent the g-, r-, i-, z-, and
y-band ﬁlters from left to right. These transmission values are
obtained by multiplying the area-weighted mean values of the ﬁlters
by the quantum eﬃciency of CCDs, the transmittance values of
the dewar window and the primary focus unit of HSC, and the
reﬂectivity of the primary mirror.

N B387, N B527, N B718, N B816, N B921, and N B973
data as detection images for z = 2.2, 3.3, 4.9, 5.7, 6.6,
and 7.0 LAE candidate selections, respectively. First
we smooth the HSC BB images and each NB image for
each redshift sample with Gaussian kernels so that their
point spread function (PSF) full width at half maximums
(FWHMs) are matched to the largest ones. For this pur-
pose, for the HSC SSP data, we download a PSF im-
age for each ﬁlter for each ≃ 12′ × 12′ patch from the
PSF Picker website4 and smooth the multiwavelength
images patch by patch. For the CHORUS data, we cre-
ate a PSF image for each ﬁlter by stacking ∼ 200 point-
source-like bright objects detected in the UD-COSMOS
ﬁeld. Typical PSF FWHMs of the smoothed HSC im-
ages are about 0.′′8–1.′′1. We then run SExtractor (Bertin
& Arnouts 1996) in the dual image mode for the PSF-
matched images, to make multiwavelength catalogs. The
main reason why we use SExtractor instead of hscPipe
to construct multiwavelength catalogs for our photomet-
ric selections of LAEs is because it is easier for us to
change the priority of the detection ﬁlters. We set DE-
TECT MINAREA to 5 and DETECT THRESH to 2.0.
We adopt MAG AUTO as total magnitudes, while we
use 2.′′0 diameter circular aperture magnitudes to mea-
sure colors of detected sources. The limiting magni-
tudes within 2.′′0 diameter apertures for the HSC SSP
and CHORUS data are summarized in Tables 2 and 3,
respectively.

From the multiwavelength catalogs, we photometri-
cally select LAE candidates at z = 2.2, 3.3, 4.9, 5.7,
6.6, and 7.0 that show clear NB excesses compared to
BB magnitudes. First, we select sources with signal-to-
noise ratio (S/N) > 5 within 2.′′0 diameter apertures in
the corresponding NB data for each redshift sample. We
then select LAE candidates by using their NB and BB

magnitudes and colors. For z = 2.2 LAEs, we adopt

g − N B387 ≥ 0.2,
r − N B387 ≥ 0.3,
i − N B387 ≥ 0.4,
z − N B387 ≥ 0.5,

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

and for z = 3.3 LAEs, we apply the following criteria

g − N B527 ≥ 0.9,
(5)
r − N B527 ≥ 0.3,
(6)
i − N B527 ≥ 0.4,
(7)
z − N B527 ≥ 0.5,
(8)
by considering the NB−BB colors of spectral energy dis-
tributions (SEDs) of young galaxies with strong Lyα
emission (see also Nakajima et al. 2012; Konno et al.
2016) as presented in Figure 2. For z = 4.9 LAEs, we
apply these criteria,

ri − N B718 > 0.7 and r − i > 0.8 and
ri − N B718 > (ri − N B718)3σ and g > g2σ,

(9)
(10)

where ri is calculated by the linear combination of the
ﬂuxes in the r band, fr, and the ﬂuxes in the i band, fi,
following fri = 0.3fr + 0.7fi (Zhang et al. 2020). The 2σ
and 3σ subscripts denote 2σ and 3σ limiting magnitudes,
respectively. We use the ri magnitude, because the wave-
length of the N B718 band is located between the r and
i bands (Figure 1). The expected ri − N B718 color as a
function of redshift for LAEs with Lyα equivalent width
(EW) in the rest frame of EW0 = 20˚A is presented in Fig-
ure 3. Similar NB excess selections have been adopted in
previous studies (e.g., Ouchi et al. 2003; Shimasaku et al.
2003; Shimasaku et al. 2004). For z = 5.7 and z = 6.6
LAEs, we adopt

and

i − N B816 ≥ 1.2,

z − N B921 ≥ 1.0

(11)

(12)

respectively, following Shibuya et al. (2018a). For z = 7.0
LAEs, we adopt

[(y < y3σ and y − N B973 > 0.7) or y > y3σ] and

(13)
(14)
(15)

[(z < z3σ and z − y > 2) or z > z3σ] and
g > g2σ and r > r2σ and i > i2σ,

which are almost the same as those used in Itoh et al.
(2018) and Zhang et al. (2020). Their expected BB−NB
colors as a function of redshift are also shown in Figure
3. These BB−NB selection criteria correspond to Lyα
EW limits of EW0 & 10–20˚A in the rest frame (see also
Zhang et al. 2020; Shibuya et al. 2018a; Itoh et al. 2018).
The speciﬁc Lyα EW limit for each redshift sample is
summarized in Section 4 together with previous studies
for comparisons of the LAE number counts.

The numbers of LAE candidates that are photometri-
cally selected with the color criteria described above are
258670 for z = 2.2 LAEs, 13937 for z = 3.3 LAEs, 2544
for z = 4.9 LAEs, 186386 for z = 5.7 LAEs, 176129 for
z = 6.6 LAEs, and 21789 for z = 7.0 LAEs. These large
numbers include many contaminants such as satellite

The solid curve corresponds to the color track of a redshifted galaxy SED with Lyα EW of 20˚A in the rest frame. We use the Bruzual &
Charlot (2003) stellar population synthesis model with a Salpeter (1955) initial mass function (IMF) and adopt a 30 Myr simple stellar
population whose UV continuum slope is suﬃciently blue, consistent with previous observational results (e.g., Stark et al. 2010; Santos
et al. 2020). We add a Lyα emission and take into account the Madau (1995) prescription of the intergalactic medium (IGM) absorption.
The SED is redshifted from z = 0.0 to z = 3.50 with a step of ∆z = 0.01. The symbols on these model tracks correspond to z = 2.14
(ﬁlled triangles), z = 2.16 (ﬁlled squares), z = 2.18 (ﬁlled circles), z = 2.20 (open squares), and z = 2.22 (open triangles) in the top panels,
and z = 3.28 (ﬁlled triangles), z = 3.30 (ﬁlled squares), z = 3.32 (ﬁlled circles), z = 3.34 (open squares), and z = 3.36 (open triangles) in
the bottom panels. The dashed lines denote the color criteria to photometrically select our LAE candidates. Note that the model track
slightly changes with Lyα EW only in the two color diagram of g − N B527 vs. r − N B527. In the other diagrams, the model tracks with
larger EW values overlap and extend to the upper right, since there is no wavelength overlap between NB and BB.

5 Our data are signiﬁcantly contaminated by satellite trails prob-
ably because the coadded images generated by the HSC pipeline
are computed as a direct weighted average of CCD images where
the weights are calculated from the inverse of the mean variance of
the input images (Bosch et al. 2018). In contrast, previous studies
using Subaru Suprime-Cam have masked out bad data areas includ-
ing satellite trails before stacking of single exposure images, and
removed outlier pixels in the process of stacking with the rejected-
mean algorithm (e.g., Ouchi et al. 2008; Ouchi et al. 2010).

performed visual inspection for the BB and NB images
of their photometrically selected 121000 LAE candidates,
which took about two person-months. In this study, the
number of photometrically selected LAE candidates is
258670+13937+2544+186386+176129+21789 = 659455.
If we scale the results of Shibuya et al. (2018a), the
amount of human eﬀort that is needed for visual inspec-
tion of all the photometrically selected LAE candidates is
estimated to be about 11 person-months. In this study,

obvious contaminants to overcome this problem. This
technique allows us to signiﬁcantly reduce the required
human resources.

3. MACHINE LEARNING SELECTION
3.1. Implementation
We adopt a machine learning based selection to remove
contaminants such as satellite trails and low-z galaxies
from the photometrically selected LAE candidate cata-
logs. For this purpose, we train a CNN so that it can
distinguish between real LAEs, satellite trails, and noise
images based on single band images. Our strategy is,
with the trained CNN, to select sources as LAE candi-
dates that are classiﬁed as real LAEs in NB probing Lyα
emission and also classiﬁed as noise images in BB probing
a wavelength range bluer than the Lyman limit (Section
4).

The CNN architecture used in this study is presented
in Table 4. We input a 50 × 50 pixel (corresponding to
8.′′4 × 8.′′4) cutout image centered on a galaxy coordinate.
Our CNN consists of four convolutional layers with 5 × 5
ﬁlters,6 two average pooling layers, and two fully con-
nected layers. Although many previous studies use max
pooling for image classiﬁcation problems, we ﬁnd that
average pooling performs better for our purpose, proba-
bly because background noises in our data are relatively
high compared to those in typical image classiﬁcation

6 Although we also try a ﬁlter size of 3 × 3 for the convolu-
tional layers, which is the same as that of Huertas-Company et al.
(2018), we ﬁnd that the accuracy is better with 5 × 5 ﬁlters, rather
than 3 × 3. This is probably because of the diﬀerent PSF sizes
and pixel scales of the images used for our study compared to
those for Huertas-Company et al. (2018). We use images taken
with Subaru/HSC, while Huertas-Company et al. (2018) use mock
Hubble/WFC3 images.

score of being an LAE (for details, see Section 3.2). The numbers
in the cells denote true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), false
positives (FP), and true negatives (TN). In the best case scenario,
the confusion matrix has non-zero elements only in its diagonal cells
and zero elements in the others. The bottom panel is the same as
the top panel, except that positive for the true labels corresponds
to simulated LAEs with S/N> 5.

(Nair & Hinton 2010), and the output layer uses the soft-
max function. Because the slope of the ReLU activation
function is zero for negative input values, we add +0.2
to the pixel counts in the input images so that most of
the pixels have positive values. The output of the fully
connected layer for each category is a predicted score; a
higher score for a category means that the input is more
likely to be classiﬁed as the category. In the output layer,
we have eight classes in total, depending on their types
and S/Ns (Table 5; for details, see Section 3.2). We use
the Adam optimization algorithm (Kingma & Ba 2014)
to minimize the cross-entropy error function over train-
ing data. The basic idea of this network architecture is
motivated by previous similar studies (Huertas-Company
et al. 2018; see also, M. Okura et al. in prep.). We imple-
ment this network by using the Python neural network
library Keras (Chollet & others 2018) with the Tensor-
Flow backend (Abadi et al. 2016).

For the training of the CNN, we create data sets for
LAEs. Because the number of spectroscopically identi-
ﬁed LAEs is limited, we make simulated images of LAEs
by using the SynPipe software (Huang et al. 2018), which
utilizes GalSim v1.4 (Rowe et al. 2015) and the HSC
pipeline. The simulated LAE images are generated so
that they have various S/Ns of 3–200 in 2.′′0 diameter cir-
cular apertures. The size distribution of these simulated
LAEs follows the observational results of Leclercq et al.
(2017). Speciﬁcally, we create a histogram of the rScont
values presented in Table B.1 of Leclercq et al. (2017)
and generate random size values that follow the distri-
bution. We adopt a uniform distribution of S´ersic indices
in the range of 1–3 to consider the scatter of the mea-
sured S´ersic indices of LAEs (Shibuya et al. 2019). The
SynPipe software inserts the simulated LAE images into
HSC images at random positions. Although these simu-
lated images allow the CNN to learn what most LAEs are
like, it should be noted that there are also rare, extended
LAEs (Lyα blobs) and Lyα-emitting merging galaxies
some of which may be excluded in our machine learning

selection. We will check this issue in Section 4 by com-
paring our ﬁnal LAE sample and previously spectroscop-
ically identiﬁed LAEs. Because of the wide S/N range
of the simulated LAEs, we divide them into four classes
according to their S/Ns to improve the accuracy of our
CNN classiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, Classes 1, 2, 3, and 4
consist of simulated LAEs with S/Ns of 3–4, 4–10, 10–
30, and 30–200, respectively. The number of simulated
images in each class is 12500. Their example images are
shown in Figure 4.

In addition, we collect data sets for contaminants.
We create two classes for satellite trails depending on
their S/Ns; Classes 5 and 6 are bright and faint satellite
trails that are labelled in our previous visual inspection
(Shibuya et al. 2018a). Since the numbers of labelled
satellite trails are limited, we augment their images by
applying 90, 180, and 270 degree rotations and horizontal
and vertical ﬂips. We also create two classes for null de-
tections. Class 7 corresponds to randomly selected noise
images and Class 8 is the same as Class 7 but shows
positive sky residuals of ≃ 0.1–0.3. Because such noise
images can be selected as LAE candidates due to noise
ﬂuctuations, these classes are also categorized as con-
taminants. The number of these images in each class is
12500, and their example images are presented in Fig-
ure 4. Note that, in the photometrically selected sample,
there should be some contaminants that are not consid-
ered in the training data for the CNN such as cosmic
rays and diﬀuse artifacts. Although such contaminants
would not be completely excluded in this machine learn-
ing selection, we perform visual inspection to remove the
remaining ones afterwards. The main advantage of this
machine learning selection is that it enables us to remove
many obvious contaminants automatically.

In total, we have eight classes as summarized in Ta-
ble 5. We divide the data for each class into two sub-
sets: training (80%) and test (20%). We use the training
data to tune model parameters of the CNN during devel-
opment, applying a ﬁve-fold cross-validation procedure.
The test data are used for evaluation of the developed
model performance. Note that the model performance
does not depend on redshift, because the size distribution
of Leclercq et al. (2017) and the S´ersic indices consider-
ing the results of Shibuya et al. (2019) are adopted to

Machine Learning-Aided Selection of ∼ 9,300 LAEs at z = 2.2–7.0 from HSC SSP and CHORUS 9

create the simulated LAE images for the training, which
are suﬃcient to account for morphologies of most LAEs
in the redshift range of z = 2.2–7.0. We thus apply the
trained CNN model to all the redshift samples. The dif-
ferences of absolute noise values in diﬀerent input images
are taken into account by scaling the input images as de-
scribed in Section 4.

Figure 5 shows the 8-label classiﬁcation results for the
test data. We classify each image into a class where
a highest predicted score is obtained. All the classes
show highest fractions for the true classes. In particular,
Classes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 achieve high accuracies of & 80–
90% for the true classes. However, Classes 2 and 3 show
relatively low accuracies, because non-negligible fractions
of images in Classes 2 and 3 are classiﬁed into the other
classes of LAEs with diﬀerent S/Ns.

Although we divide the input data into the eight classes
in total, our interest is basically whether an object is clas-
siﬁed as positive (i.e., LAEs) or negative (i.e., contami-
nants such as satellite trails and randomly selected noise
images). Thus, we use the CNN as a classiﬁer that works
on the binary classiﬁcation problem. We deﬁne sources
as positive if they show a high score of being an LAE,
satisfying p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 > 0.95 and p2 + p3 + p4 > 0.5,
where pi denotes the score of Class i. Sources that do
not satisfy these criteria are classiﬁed as negative ones.
Figure 6 shows the confusion matrices for our binary
classiﬁcation results. For binary classiﬁcation problems,
confusion matrices split predictions into true positives
(TPs, i.e., simulated LAEs recovered by the CNN), false
positives (FPs, i.e., contaminants that are selected as
LAEs by the CNN), false negatives (FNs, i.e., simulated
LAEs that are not selected by the CNN), and true neg-
atives (TNs, i.e., contaminants recovered by the CNN).
Based on the results shown in the top panel of Figure 6,
the completeness of the classiﬁer, fcomp, can be obtained
from

fcomp =

nTP
nTP + nFN

,

(16)

where nTP denotes the number of true positives, and nFN
is the number of false negatives. We ﬁnd that the fcomp
value for the test data of the simulated LAEs in Classes
1–4 is not so high, about 69%. This is because these
classes include simulated LAEs with low S/Ns down to
only 3. Figure 7 shows the completeness as a function
of input S/N. We ﬁnd that the fcomp values are & 90%
for bright sources with input magnitudes of . 24.5 mag.
To remove the eﬀect from low-S/N sources, we show the
confusion matrix in the bottom panel of Figure 6 where
we focus on simulated LAEs with S/Ns > 5 for the true
labels. We ﬁnd that the fcomp value for simulated LAEs
with S/Ns > 5 is high, ≃ 94%

From the confusion matrix, we also calculate the con-

tamination rate of the classiﬁer, fcont,

fcont =

nFP
nTP + nFP

,

(17)

where nFP is the number of false positives. We conﬁrm
that the contamination rate is very low, only ≃ 1%, based
on the bottom panel of Figure 6.

It should be noted that these completeness and con-
tamination rate estimates are the results for the test
data, controlling the balance of the numbers in the

classes. For the actual data, these values should be dif-
ferent, because the number ratios between the classes
are diﬀerent. However, we do not rely solely on the ma-
chine learning selection for contamination removal. As
described above in this section, after applying the ma-
chine learning selection, we perform visual inspection to
further remove possible contaminants that are not ex-
cluded with the CNN.

4. RESULTS: APPLICATION TO THE NEW HSC SSP AND

CHORUS DATA

We apply the trained CNN to our photometrically se-
lected LAE candidates prepared in Section 2 to eﬃciently
remove contaminants such as satellite trails and low-z in-
terlopers by making use of our HSC NB and BB images.
Our machine learning selection consists of two steps.
First we use the NB images of the photometrically se-
lected LAE candidates as input data for the CNN and
obtain their score for each class to select sources with
a high score of being a positive (an LAE). In this pro-
cess, we remove contaminants of satellite trails from the
photometrically selected LAE candidates based on their
morphologies in the NB images. Next, we use their BB
images whose wavelength coverages are basically shorter
than the Lyman limit wavelengths for targeted redshifts.
We require that the candidates have p7 + p8 > 0.5, i.e., a
high score of null detection, which enables us to remove
low-z interlopers from the photometrically selected LAE
candidates. For this purpose, we use g-band images for
z = 4.9 and z = 5.7 LAEs, g- and r-band images for
z = 6.6 LAEs, and g-, r-, and i-band images for z = 7.0
LAEs. We do not use BB images for z = 2.2 and z = 3.3
LAEs, because their Lyman limit wavelengths are still
shorter than the g-band wavelength coverage. Note that,
because the absolute value of noise is diﬀerent in each
band, the input NB and BB images are scaled so that
the absolute noise values are comparable to those of the
training data in these two steps.

After these two steps, the numbers of LAE candidates
in our samples are signiﬁcantly reduced. The numbers of
the remaining LAE candidates at z = 2.2, 3.3, 4.9, 5.7,
6.6, and 7.0 are about 8000, 2600, 1500, 10000, 5000,
and 380, which correspond to about 3, 18, 58, 6, 3, and
2 % of the photometrically selected LAE candidates, re-
spectively. Although the diﬀerence of these fractions is
due to the diﬀerent fractions of obvious contaminants in
the photometrically selected LAE candidates, which are
likely to depend on the strictness of the photometric se-
lection criteria, these low values indicate that our CNN
removes a large number of contaminants in the photo-
metrically selected LAE samples. Thanks to the CNN
application, the human resources that are needed for the
visual inspection are greatly reduced compared to our
previous work (see Sections 2 and 3.2).

We then perform visual inspection of the NB and BB
images of the LAE candidates that satisfy our machine
learning selection criteria to further remove possible con-
taminants. Most contaminants excluded in this visual
inspection process are the ones that are not considered
in the training data for the CNN as expected, such as
cosmic rays, diﬀuse artifacts, and noisy images around
the edge of the survey area where the image qualities are
poor. Our careful selection yields samples of 4409, 959,
349, 2881, 680, and 40 LAE candidates at z = 2.2, 3.3,

20, 30, 10, and 10 % of the LAE candidates that sat-
isfy the machine learning selection criteria, respectively.
Some of the fractions are still not so high. However, these
fractions decrease without the machine learning selection
to 1.7, 6.9, 14, 1.5, 0.4, and 0.2% for the z = 2.2, 3.3,
4.9, 5.7, 6.6, and 7.0 LAE samples, respectively, which
indicates a signiﬁcant improvement thanks to the ma-
chine learning selection, although it also depends on the
strictness of the photometric selection criteria. Note that
the score of a spectroscopically conﬁrmed spatially ex-
tended LAE, Himiko (Ouchi et al. 2009; Ouchi et al.
2013), for its NB data is slightly smaller than the crite-
rion of p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 > 0.95. This is probably be-

cause its morphology is signiﬁcantly more extended than
those adopted for the training data, although other ex-
tended LAEs such as CR7 (Sobral et al. 2015) satisfy the
NB criterion. Because Himiko has already been spectro-
scopically conﬁrmed, we add it to the ﬁnal catalog. In
addition, we notice that the score of another spectro-
scopically conﬁrmed LAE, COLA-1 (Hu et al. 2016), for
the BB data is higher than the criterion probably due
to the presence of a foreground object at z = 2.142 in
its vicinity on the sky (Matthee et al. 2018). Because
COLA-1 is also a spectroscopically conﬁrmed LAE, it is
also included in the ﬁnal catalog. The number of our
LAE candidates in the ﬁnal catalog with each NB for
each ﬁeld is summarized in Table 6.

Figure 8 shows the number counts of our LAE can-
didates in the ﬁnal catalogs at z = 2.2, 3.3, 4.9, 5.7,
6.6, and 7.0 as a function of total NB magnitude. To
calculate the 1σ uncertainties, we take account of Pois-
son conﬁdence limits (Gehrels 1986) on the number of
the selected LAE candidates in each NB magnitude bin.
For the LAE samples selected from the CHORUS data,
we apply the masks that are provided by Inoue et al.
(2020) for conservative estimates, although the number
count results are mostly consistent with the results with-
out the masks. At z = 2.2, 5.7, and 6.6, we also show
the number counts of the LAE candidates for the survey
ﬁelds separately. We conﬁrm that these number counts
are broadly consistent with each other at each redshift.
In Figure 9, we compare our average number counts
with previous results where the selection criteria are sim-

jima et al. 2012; Nakajima et al. 2013; Konno et al. 2016;
Shibuya et al. 2018a; Hao et al. 2018; Itoh et al. 2018;
Zhang et al. 2020; see also Table 7). We conﬁrm that,
in the magnitude ranges that have been probed in pre-
vious studies, our results are in good agreement with
the previous results. On the other hand, comparisons of
faint end results are not simple, because not only NBs
but also BBs are involved, whose limiting magnitudes
are not completely uniform between and within the sur-
vey ﬁelds. Because the 5σ limiting magnitudes of our

N B387 data for most of our survey ﬁelds are ≃ 24.3–24.7
mag, the incompleteness eﬀects in our number counts of
z = 2.2 LAEs are non-negligible at faint magnitudes of
N B387 & 24 mag, compared to the previous results of
Nakajima et al. (2012) and Hao et al. (2018), whose 5σ
limiting magnitudes are ∼ 26 mag. In contrast, although
the 5σ limiting magnitudes of our N B527 data are deeper
than those of the previous work at similar redshifts, the
incompleteness eﬀect in our number counts is signiﬁcant
at around N B527 ≃ 25 mag, which is comparable to
those of the previous results. This is probably because

our BB data are relatively shallow. Similar discussion
can be made for the results at higher redshifts.

Most of our survey ﬁelds have already been observed
in our previous work (Shibuya et al. 2018a). We compare
our LAE catalogs with those constructed in our previous
work at z = 5.7 and z = 6.6 and calculate the object-
matching rates as a function of NB magnitudes. We ﬁnd
that the object-matching rates are ≃ 80–100% at bright
NB magnitudes of . 24 mag for the UD ﬁelds where the
eﬀect of photometric uncertainties is not relatively signif-
icant. The high object-matching rates indicate that we
adequately select LAE candidates in our machine learn-
ing selection processes. Note that the object-matching
rates decrease to ≃ 60–70% at the fainter magnitudes
of ≃ 24.5–25 mag, mainly due to the increase of the ef-
fect of photometric uncertainties. We conﬁrm that these
object-matching rates are comparable to those obtained
in Shibuya et al. (2018a).

We also compare our LAE catalogs with the results of
our previous spectroscopic observations for high-z galax-
ies in our survey ﬁelds including the ones with Mag-
ellan/IMACS (PI: M. Ouchi; M. Ouchi in prep.; Ono
et al. 2018; Harikane et al. 2019), as well as the publicly
available spectroscopic catalogs shown in previous stud-
ies (Saito et al. 2008; Ouchi et al. 2008; Willott et al.
2010; Ouchi et al. 2010; Masters et al. 2012; Mallery
et al. 2012; Willott et al. 2013; McGreer et al. 2013; Le
F`evre et al. 2013; Shibuya et al. 2014; Kriek et al. 2015;

et al. 2016; Tasca et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2017; Masters
et al. 2017; Hu et al. 2017; Ikeda et al. 2017; Jiang et al.

et al. 2018; Masters et al. 2019; Harikane et al. 2019;
Calvi et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2020; Lyke et al. 2020; On-
odera et al. 2020). We adopt their classiﬁcations between
galaxies and AGNs in their catalogs if available. For the
catalogs of the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS: Le
F`evre et al. 2013) and the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey
(VUDS: Tasca et al. 2017), we take into account sources
whose redshifts are > 70%–75% correct, i.e., sources with
redshift reliability ﬂags of 2, 3, 4, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 19.
We ﬁnd that 177 LAEs in our samples have been spec-
troscopically conﬁrmed by our observations and in the
previous studies. Among them, 155 sources are found to
be Lyα-emitting galaxies, and the other 22 sources are
Lyα-emitting AGNs. The catalog of these spectroscopi-
cally conﬁrmed LAEs is presented in Table A1. We con-
ﬁrm that their spectroscopic redshifts are consistent with
those expected from the redshift coverages of the NBs
used in this study. Their redshift distributions around
the redshift ranges probed with the NBs are shown in
Figure 10.

To characterize these redshift distributions, we ﬁt the
transmission curves of the NBs to them. Speciﬁcally, we
derive the best-ﬁt NB transmission curves by a χ2 mini-
mization ﬁt with a normalization constant and a redshift
shift as free parameters, i.e., N (z) = αT (z + β), where
N (z) is the redshift distribution, T (z) is the NB trans-
mission curve, α is the normalization constant, and β
is the shift along the x-axis. The observed wavelengths
of the NB transmission curves are converted to the Lyα
redshifts, zLyα, by zLyα = λobs/λLyα − 1, where λobs

is the observed wavelength and λLyα = 1215.67˚A is the
Lyα wavelength. The best-ﬁt results are shown in Figure
10, and the best-ﬁt parameters are presented in Table 8.
We do not perform the ﬁtting for z = 3.3 and z = 7.0,
because of the limited number of the data points. We
ﬁnd that the solid curves ﬁt the histograms well. We
also ﬁnd that, the best-ﬁt β values for N B718, N B816,
and N B921 are negative. This is probably because, for
high redshift LAEs, although a high sensitivity for Lyα
emission is necessary, a high sensitivity for continuum
emission also makes it easier for the NBs to detect LAEs.
Another possible reason is that the majority of the spec-
troscopic redshifts used for the compilation are based on
the catalogs whose sources are found with instruments
other than HSC.

In addition to the 177 spectroscopically conﬁrmed
LAEs, we notice that 4 sources in our sample have also
been spectroscopically conﬁrmed as lower-z sources in
the previous studies. In fact, these 4 source are AGNs
at slightly lower redshift where strong Civ emission is
probed with our NBs. The catalog of these sources is
presented in Table A2. Although it is diﬃcult to make
a fair comparison based on the available catalogs, the
small number of the spectroscopic identiﬁcations at low
redshifts may suggest that the contamination rate of low-
z interlopers is low. However, it should be noted that,
because our selections do not use BB data whose wave-
lengths are bluer than the Lyman limit for our z = 2.2
and z = 3.3 LAE samples, it is not surprising that these
two samples are relatively contaminated by lower-z in-
terlopers such as strong [Oii] and [Oiii] emitters. Quan-
titative discussion for such possibilities is waiting to be
examined with further spectroscopic observations.

5. SUMMARY
We have constructed a catalog of 9,318 LAE candi-
dates at z = 2.2, 3.3, 4.9, 5.7, 6.6, and 7.0 with the aid of
the machine learning technique based on the multiwave-
length data over the 1.6–25.0 deg2 sky taken with the six
narrowband ﬁlters of N B387, N B527, N B718, N B816,
N B921, and N B973, and the ﬁve broadband ﬁlters of g,
r, i, z, and y in the HSC SSP and CHORUS. We have
ﬁrst photometrically selected LAE candidates based on
the NB-excess features of their SEDs. We have then cre-
ated the CNN, which is recently frequently adopted for
image classiﬁcation problems, to distinguish between real
LAEs and contaminants. We have found that the com-
pleteness and contamination rate of the trained CNN are
94% and 1%, respectively. By taking advantage of the
trained CNN, we have eﬃciently removed contaminants
such as satellite trails and low-z interlopers from the
photometrically selected LAE candidates. Speciﬁcally,
for all the photometrically selected LAE candidates, the
amount of human eﬀort to conduct visual inspection is
estimated to be about 11 person-months, but we have sig-
niﬁcantly reduced it thanks to the CNN application. We
have conﬁrmed that our machine learning selected LAE
samples are reliable on the basis of 177 LAEs that have
already been spectroscopically identiﬁed by our SILVER-
RUSH programs and previous studies. In addition, we
have found that the object-matching rates between our
LAE catalogs and our previous results are ≃ 80–100%
at bright NB magnitudes of . 24 mag, which also sup-
ports the validity of our selection method. We have also

conﬁrmed that the surface number densities of our LAE
candidates are consistent with previous results. Our LAE
catalogs will become available online.

A. CATALOG OF SPECTROSCOPICALLY CONFIRMED LAES IN OUR SAMPLES

APPENDIX

In this paper, we present a catalog of spectroscopically conﬁrmed galaxies and AGNs in our LAE samples in Table
A1. In addition, we also present a catalog of spectroscopically conﬁrmed AGNs that are selected with our NBs because

Machine Learning-Aided Selection of ∼ 9,300 LAEs at z = 2.2–7.0 from HSC SSP and CHORUS 17

of their strong Civ emission in Table A2. Our new SILVERRUSH LAE catalogs based on new HSC SSP and CHORUS
data will be made public on our project webpage as described in Section 1.
