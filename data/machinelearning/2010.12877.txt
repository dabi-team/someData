Abstract

In order to develop a comprehensive EEG signal processing framework, in this paper, we demonstrate a toolbox and Graphical
User Interface (GUI), EEGsig, for the full EEG signal processing procedure. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive suite, free
and open-source framework for EEG signal processing, so that the users, especially physicians with little programming experience,
can focus on their practical requirements, thereby accelerating the medical projects. We have integrated all the three EEG signal
processing phases, including preprocessing, feature extraction, and classiﬁcation, into EEGsig, , created using MATLAB software.
In addition to a variety of useful features, in EEGsig, we have implemented three popular classiﬁcation algorithms (K-NN, SVM,
and ANN) in EEGsig to evaluate the performance of the features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our novel framework
for EEG signal processing delivers outstanding classiﬁcation perforfance and feature extraction robustness under various machine
learning classiﬁer algorithms. Furthermore, with EEGsig, all EEG signal channels can be viewed simultaneously for selecting the
best feature extracted,; hence, the effect of each task on the signal is visible. We believe that our user-centered MATLAB package
provides an encouraging platform for novice users while also offering experienced users the maximum level of control.

I. INTRODUCTION

N EUROPHYSIOLOGICAL measures have gotten widespread attention in the ﬁeld of cognition and behavior. As one of

the important branches of measurements, Electroencephalography(EEG) is a non-invasive neural imaging method that is
widely employed in different medical and engineering applications such as seizure detection and Brain-Computer Interface
(BCI), among others [1], [2]. Despite the fact that it has a lower spatial resolution than Functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (FMRI), EEG’s high temporal resolution has enabled it to provide a platform for analyzing brain activities down to
milliseconds. [3]. Recently, due to the evolution of neuroscience and its relationship with engineering sciences (such as BCI)
[4], there has been an increasing demand for efﬁcient algorithms and tools in the ﬁeld of bio-signal processing. There are
many toolboxes and frameworks available for the analysis and processing of EEG signals, including EEGLAB [5], CARTOOL
[6], Fieldtrip [7], Brainstorm [8], Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) [9], and BrainNet Viewer [10]. The majority of the
above-mentioned toolboxes are only intended for signal analysis/process, and EEG signal visualization. The performance of
the toolboxes and frameworks proposed in the ﬁeld of EEG signal processing can only be summarized in the pre-processing
and feature extraction domains. In this paper, however, we have developed a novel toolbox and graphical user interface, called
EEGsig, and included a machine learning-based classiﬁcation component to the pre-processing and feature extraction sections.
We have provided a variety of features for users to better analyze the bio-signals and extract the desired results. The goal of
the EEGsig is to support research in biomedical signal processing by providing a user-friendly, interactive MATLAB software,
which can be expressed more speciﬁcally as follows: First, we have created a comprehensive toolbox for EEG signal processing
by integrating all the signal processing steps, including the machine learning classiﬁer to the signal classiﬁcation, in such a
way that even inexperienced users may begin utilizing the toolbox. Our step-by-step tutorials enable users to communicate with
our user-centered MATLAB package via the GUI without using MATLAB syntax. Second, in the feature extraction section,
we have provided a varied list of all the features (statistical parameters such as standard deviation, mean, entropy, FFT, and
the power spectrum of brain’s rhythms) in the feature extraction section. Finally, we ensured the toolbox was available in all
EEG signal channels, allowing simultaneous viewing of the effect of each task on the signal, such as noise removal or feature
extractiion, etc can be visible simultaneously.

A. Electroencephalography (EEG)

II. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND

EEG records the brain’s electrical activity using multiple, non-invasive surface electrodes implanted on the skin in a non-
invasive manner. Generally, in an EEG system, the electrical trace of the neural activity is transferred to the device via
electrodes mounted on the scalp, and after amplifying and removing the noise, it is recorded and displayed as a time-domain
signal after noise is ampliﬁed and eliminated [11]. The recorded signal can be examined directly or after computer processing

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

by a physician or neuroscientist for a variety of applications. EEG recording devices typically include 8, 16, or 32 channels.
Typically, a pulse calibration signal is used to calibrate the system, the received signals are ampliﬁed, and noise is eliminated.
Time-domain signals can be recorded directly or can be converted to digital signals before being entered into a computer for
further processing, such as determining the signal’s frequency range or classifying and applying diagnostic algorithms. Many
brain disorders can be identiﬁed by visual assessment of the EEG signals. The ﬁve primary brain signal rhythms that are
observed in all humans can be distinguished by frequency ranges and from lower to higher frequencies are referredto as delta,
theta, alpha, beta, and gamma signals, respectively.

Delta waves are the rhythms with the lowest frequency (0.5-4 Hz) and highest amplitude among the brain rhythms [12]. It
should be noted that Delta waves are not viewed in the rhythms of neurotypical adults in a waking state. The frequency range
of theta waves is 4-8 Hz, and their location is unknown; theta waves can be found in all areas of the brain. The frequency range
of alpha waves is 8-13 Hz. Alpha rhythms appear during mental and physical relaxation, and they are especially strong in the
back of the head when eyes are closed [13]. The brain’s electrical activity in the 14 to 30 Hz range is attributed to beta waves.
Beta waves are the brain’s regular waking rhythm, which are linked to active thinking, focusing on the environment, or solving
complex problems, and can be observed in neurotypical adults [14]. The gamma rhythm is attributed to frequencies above 30
Hz; however, the amplitude of these waves is insigniﬁcant, and their existence can be ignored [15]. Each brain rhythm has
a unique purpose, and the human brain’s ﬂexibility and capacity to switch between different rhythms plays a vital role in an
individual’s success in daily activities like regulating anxiety or focusing on assignments etc [16]. We extract these rhythms
from the EEG signal using the EEGsig toolbox and wavelet conversion.

EEG’s high temporal resolution, simple recording equipment, and ability to detect instantaneous variations in brain activity,
have made it a promising candidate for the observation of important psychosocial symptoms such as stress and emotional
tension when compared to other biometrics (i.e., EMG, ST, EDA, and BVP) [17].

B. Independent component analysis (ICA)

Because of its advantageous applications in signal processing [19], the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [18] method
has been considered in the processing of bio-signals. ICA is a signal processing method that is employed to differentiate
independent sources when they are linearly combined in numerous sensors. For instance, when recording EEG signals on the
scalp, ICA can distinguish artifacts embedded in the data (since they are usually independent of each other). Because artifact
activities are not phase-locked to each others, ICA attempts to decompose multivariate signals into independent non-Gaussian
signals. In this case, we utilize ICA to remove artifacts (stereotyped eye, muscle, and line noise) from the EEG signals.

For further clariﬁcation, consider just two electrodes that are receiving the EEG signal from the brain, and are located in
different locations on the scalp. The output recorded time-domain signals of electrodes can be expressed as Eq. (1) and (2),
where X1(t) and X2(t) denote amplitude of signals over time. A weighted sum of the EEG signals, referred to as S1(t) and
S2(t), is created for each of these signals.

X1(t) = aS1(t) + bS2(t)

X2(t) = cS1(t) + dS2(t)

(1)

(2)

The values of a, b, c, and d in the above equation depend on the location and distances between the electrodes. Eqs. (1)
and (2) are linear and the equation can be solved by knowing these four parameters.. However, due to the complexities of
calculating these parameters, especially when there are multiple channels for receiving EEG signals, the equation is difﬁcult
to solve. To address this challenge, we may use the ICA to determine the parameters based on their independence, enabling
us to distinguish the two (or more) source signals S1(t) and S2(t) from their combinations X1(t) and X2(t) EEG signals
record electrical potentials that are likely produced by a mixture of certain fundamental components of brain activity as well
as numerous external inputs such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), which are also a distinct source and inﬂuence
other channels of EEG reception. Because we observe the combination of components of brain activity, our ideal goal is to
detect the original components, which can be deﬁned as the net electrical potential of the brain in the desired area. In this
case, ICA can be used to obtain the main components of the electric potential obtained in the desired area.

C. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)

Wavelets analysis approaches that provide a representation of a particular signal on a temporal scale have been widely
used in bio-signal processing [20]. These methods characterize the temporal properties of a signal with the aid of its spectral
elements in the frequency domain. As a result, the main components of a signal can be extracted in order to recognize and
model the physiological system. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) are the two
categories of wavelet transforms. [21]. A signal x[n] is passed through a series of low-pass and high-pass ﬁlters that have
an impulse response of g and h, respectively, with a low sampling rate of two. The discrete decomposition can be expressed

mathematically as Eqs. (3) and (4), where A[n] and D[n] are the wavelet’s approximate and detailed coefﬁcients, respectively,
and this process continues as illustrated in Fig. 1.

It is critical to choose the right wavelet and the decomposition levels number when analysing signals with DWT. The number
of decomposition levels is determined by the signal’s dominant frequency components. Because of its smoothing property, the
Daubechies-4 mother wavelet is better suited to detecting changes in EEG signals. [22].

Fig. 1: Sub-band decomposition using DWT; x[n] is the input signal, h[n] is the high-pass ﬁlter and g[n] is the low-pass ﬁlter.

D. Entropy

Entropy is one of the features that is widely used in EEG signal processing [23]. In science and engineering, entropy can
be expressed in terms of ambiguity or disorder. Claude Shannon pioneered the Shannon’s entropy [24]. deﬁning the entropy
H of a discrete random variable X with possible values {x1, x1, x3, . . . , xn} and probability mass function P(x) as:

H(x) = E[I(x)] = E[− logb P (x)]

(5)

in the preceding equation, E[.] computes the expected value, and I(x) is the information of the random variable X. It should
be noted that b is the logarithm’s base and by changing it, entropy can be calculated in various units. The most common values
of b are 2, Euler’s number (e), and 10, which calculate entropy in a bits, nats, and hartley units, respectively. Entropy can also
be expressed as :

H(x) =

E. fast Fourier transform (FFT)

A signal can be converted from its main domain (usually time or space) to a frequency domain representation using Fourier
analysis and vice versa [25]. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a key algorithm in signal processing and data analysis. The
Fourier Transform is a mathematical operation that is frequently used to convert a signal from the time domain to the frequency
domain. The frequency spectrum of a signal, which can be implemented with FFT, is critical in EEG signal analysis. FFT is
a faster version of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) that produces the same results as the deﬁnition of discrete Fourier
transform [26]. Consider complex numbers of x0, ...., xN −1; the following formula is then used to deﬁne the DFT.:

Xk =

N −1
(cid:88)

n=0

xn.e

(7)

where k = 0, 1, 2, ...N − 1, and N denotes the samples’ number. In addition, xn is the signal’s value at time n, and k is the
current frequency (0 Hz to N-1 Hz), and Xk is the output of Discrete Fourier Transform. The following is the formula for the
Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT):

xn =

the signal strength spectrum as well as transferring some speciﬁc problems to the desired space for easier computations.

F. Statistical parameters

Statistical features are another important feature that can be used in EEG signal processing. Apart from their straightforward
appearance, they can provide an important perspective of a signal. We have provided a diverse list of these features in EEGsig,
such as standard deviation, variance, and mean which their formulas can be found in Eqs. (9), (10), and (11), respectively.

G. Classiﬁcation

A classiﬁcation process should be applied to the extracted features to assess the performance of the features and to better
evaluate the biological signals [27]. Ror this purpose, various machine learning algorithms are used. We implemented three
popular classiﬁcation algorithms in EEGsig, with a special emphasis on supervised learning algorithms. When presented with
new unlabeled data, a supervised machine learning algorithm uses labelled input data to learn a function that produces the
appropriate output. In our toolbox, we have implemented Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and
k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN).

MLPs are a type of feedforward Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN) with at least three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer,
and an output layer. The rest of the nodes, with the exemption of the input nodes, is a neuron with a nonlinear activation
function. SVM is a supervised machine learning technique that can be employed for classiﬁcation and regression problems,
however it is most typically employed for classiﬁcation. SVM is given a set of tagged data, each of which belongs to a speciﬁc
category. Then, during the training process, SVM creates a model that assigns new samples to a category in the classiﬁcation
operation. The K-NN algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm that is used in data mining, machine learning, and pattern
recognition. K-NN is a simple algorithm that stores all existing cases and classiﬁes new ones using a similarity metric (e.g.,
distance functions) [28], [29].

III. EEGSIG TOOLBOX

EEGsig is a free and open-source MATLAB-based GUI, developed with the MATLAB software, a popular numerical
programming language used in biosignal processing. The EEGsig is divided into four sections: preprocessing, feature extraction,
classiﬁcation, and one for data clearing/storing and exiting. Fig. 2 depicts an overview of the EEGsig toolbox, which is devided
into two parts for better presentation (See Fig. 3).

We made our best effort to make it user-friendly for beginners while also providing expert users with the most control. We
divided the EEGsig workﬂow into two parts, as shown in Fig. 3. Each part begins with data loading, with the exemption of
the the classiﬁcation section, which requires data labels to be entered.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

To evaluate the effectiveness of our designed EEGsig, we use a dataset provided by the Colorado State University’s BCI
laboratory [30]. As shown in Table 1, this open-access free website provides EEG data with ﬁve different types of mental
tasks. Each signal consists of 7 rows and 2500 columns. Data is collected for seven subjects across ﬁve mental tasks. Channels
c3, c4, p3, p4, o1, o2, and EOG are represented by these seven rows. 2500 samples were stored across the columns at a rate
of 250 Hz for ten seconds. Fig. 2 shows the diagram of a part of the signal.

Using the aforementioned dataset, we investigated the performance of EEGsig. The noise and artifact removal steps, which
are part of the pre-processing, are shown in Fig. 4(a). In addition, in the feature extraction section, we demonstrate four features
on behalf of other features, which are the alpha and theta waves and their corresponding power spectrum, as shown in Fig. 4.
(b-e). Finally, to evaluate the performance of the classiﬁcation part, we performed a classiﬁcation that achieved 97.5% accuracy
for the training data using the total data in the database.

It should be noted that any operation in all the three stages of preprocessing, feature extraction, and classiﬁcation can be
displayed in the EEGsig toolbox at the same time. This aspect of EEGsig is valuable because it allows us to extract the best

features for a machine learning classiﬁer to learn. Furthermore, to visualize the performance of our algorithm, we calculated
the confusion matrix in the classiﬁcation section output(See Fig. 4(f)). Also, the output calculates the three parameters of
sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and accuracy. As previously stated, we implemented three algorithms in the machine learning classiﬁer:
k-NN, SVM, and ANN . In the preceding example, we employed an ANN to learn the data and train the network before
calculating the confusion matrix. This is because we linked our ANN classiﬁer to the MATLAB software’s neural network
toolbox. Thus, unlike k-NN and SVM, which provide the three output parameters as notiﬁcations, the neural network obtains
the visual graphical output of confusion matrix.

In summary, experimental results showed that our novel framework for EEG signal processing achieved excellent classiﬁcation
results and feature extraction robustness when using various machine learning classiﬁer algorithms. We believe that EEGsig is
a promising candidate for analyzing biological signals, particularly for physicians who do not have a programming background;
As a result, they can focus on their practical requirements, allowing medical projects to move more quickly.

We presented a systematic signal-processing framework in which all the three EEG signal processing steps, including
preprocessing, feature extraction, and classiﬁcation are aggregated into a single toolbox, which was previously unavailable.
Noise and artifacts were successfully removed in the preprocessing section by employing a low pass ﬁlter and the ICA
Algorithm. We gathered various useful features that can be extracted from EEG signals in the feature extraction section, and

they can be viewed simultaneously in the parts that are prepared to display the signal. Finally, we presented a machine learning
classiﬁer that employs machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, k-NN, and SVM to operate as a classiﬁcation
section by loading labels and data. Our goal was to investigate the effectiveness of our comprehensive tool-chain of data
processing methods. To that end, we evaluated EEGsig’s performance using a dataset from Colorado State University’s BCI
laboratory, which included ﬁve different types of mental tasks. In the data classiﬁcation section, our simulation results reached
97.5% accuracy. Furthermore, suggestions for the improving our toolbox are welcome and will be openly discussed by the
community.

The article codes will be placed in ”https://github.com/fardinghorbani/EEGsig” after publication.
