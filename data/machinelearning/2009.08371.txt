Abstract. We present a method for microtubule tracking in electron
microscopy volumes. Our method ﬁrst identiﬁes a sparse set of voxels
that likely belong to microtubules. Similar to prior work, we then enu-
merate potential edges between these voxels, which we represent in a
candidate graph. Tracks of microtubules are found by selecting nodes
and edges in the candidate graph by solving a constrained optimization
problem incorporating biological priors on microtubule structure. For
this, we present a novel integer linear programming formulation, which
results in speed-ups of three orders of magnitude and an increase of 53%
in accuracy compared to prior art (evaluated on three 1.2 × 4 × 4µm vol-
umes of Drosophila neural tissue). We also propose a scheme to solve the
optimization problem in a block-wise fashion, which allows distributed
tracking and is necessary to process very large electron microscopy vol-
umes. Finally, we release a benchmark dataset for microtubule tracking,
here used for training, testing and validation, consisting of eight 30 x 1000
x 1000 voxel blocks (1.2 × 4 × 4µm) of densely annotated microtubules
in the CREMI data set (https://github.com/nilsec/micron).

Introduction

Microtubules are part of the cytoskeleton of a cell and crucial for a variety
of cellular processes such as structural integrity and intracellular transport of
cargo [15]. They are of particular interest for the connectomics community, as
they directly follow the morphology of neurons. Tracking of microtubules there-
fore provides additional structural information that can potentially be leveraged
for guided proof-reading of neuron segmentation and aid in the identiﬁcation of
neural subcompartments such as backbones and twigs [17].

Manual tracking of microtubules faces the same limitations as neuron seg-
mentation and synapse annotations. The resolution needed to discern individual
structures of interest like neural arbors, synapses, and microtubules can only
be achieved with high resolution electron microscopy (EM), which results in
large datasets (several hundred terabytes) even for small model organisms like
Drosophila melanogaster [22]. With datasets of these sizes, a purely manual anal-
ysis becomes impractical. Consequently, the ﬁeld of connectomics sparked a surge
of automatic methods to segment neurons (for recent advances see [7,11,13,14]),

Fig. 1: Overview of the proposed method. 1. Microtubule scores are predicted
via a 3D UNet [16]. Inlets show two microtubules that run perpendicular to the
imaging plane (appearing as circles) and one that deviates from a 90 degree
angle of incidence (appearing as a line segment). The corresponding (noisy) mi-
crotubule scores show the necessity of post processing. 2. Candidate microtubule
segments are extracted and represented as vertices in a 3D graph, where vertices
are connected within a threshold distance. 3. Final microtubule trajectories are
found by solving a constrained optimization problem.

annotate synapses [2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 19], and identify other structures of biolog-
ical relevance such as microtubules [4] or mitochondria [5, 6, 21]. Large scale
automatic reconstruction of microtubules is a particularly challenging problem.
With an outer diameter of 24 nm, microtubules are close to the resolution limit
of serial section EM1. Especially in anisotropic EM volumes, the appearance of
microtubules changes drastically depending on their angle of incidence to the
imaging plane. Furthermore, they are often locally indistinguishable from other
cell organelles (like endoplasmic reticulum) or noise.

Our method for microtubule tracking is based on the formulation proposed
in [4], with signiﬁcant improvements in terms of eﬃciency and accuracy. Similar
to [4], we ﬁrst predict a score for each voxel to be part of a microtubule. We
then identify promising candidate points and possible links between them in a
candidate graph as nodes and edges. Finally, we solve a constraint optimization

problem incorporating biological priors to ﬁnd a subset of edges that constitute
microtubule tracks (for an overview see Fig. 1).
Our four main contributions are as follows: 1. We propose a new integer linear
program (ILP) formulation, which decreases the time needed to solve the con-
straint optimization by several orders of magnitude. 2. We devise a scheme to
solve the resulting optimization problem in a block-wise fashion in linear time,
and thus are able to process real-world sized volumes. 3. Our formulation al-
lows tracking of microtubules in arbitrary orientations in anisotropic volumes
by introducing a non-maxima suppression (NMS) based candidate extraction
method. 4. We improve the voxel-level classiﬁer by training a 3D UNet [7,16] on
skeleton annotations, leading to more accurate microtubule scores.

We evaluate our method on a new benchmark comprising 153.6 µm3 of
densely traced microtubules, demonstrating a 53% increase in accuracy (0.517 →
0.789 F1 score) compared to the prior state of the art. Source code and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/nilsec/micron.

2 Method

2.1 Predictions

Starting from the raw EM input data, we train a 3D UNet [16] to predict a
microtubule score m ∈ [0, 1] for each voxel. We generate microtubule scores for
training from manually annotated skeletons by interpolating between skeleton
markers on a voxel grid followed by Gaussian smoothing. In addition, we train
the network to predict spatial gradients of the microtubule score up to second
order. This is motivated by the idea that the spatial gradient encodes the local
shape of a predicted object. Since microtubule segments have locally line-like
shapes this auxiliary task potentially regularises microtubule score predictions.

2.2 Candidate Extraction

Given the predicted microtubule score we perform candidate extraction via two
NMS passes, to guarantee that two successive candidates of a single microtubule
track are not farther apart than the distance threshold θd we will use to connect
two candidates with each other. In a ﬁrst pass, we perform NMS and thresh-
olding with a stride equal to the NMS window size, guaranteeing at least one
candidate per NMS window if the maximum is above the threshold. This strat-
egy is problematic if the local maximum lies on the boarder or corner of a NMS
window as this produces multiple, in the worst case eight, candidates that are
direct neighbors of each other. We remove this redundancy by performing a sec-
ond NMS pass on the already extracted maxima, providing us with the ﬁnal set
of microtubule segment candidate detections C.

(b) ILP following [4].

(c) Reformulated ILP on triplet indicators.

Fig. 2: Constraint optimization on the candidate graph. We formulate an ILP
on binary triplet indicators, which encode the joint selection of two incident
candidate edges. The constraints shown in (a) ensure that found tracks are not
crossing or splitting. Although mathematically equivalent to the formulation
in (b), our formulation (c) is orders of magnitudes more eﬃcient (see Fig. 4).

2.3 Constrained Optimization

Following [4], we represent each candidate microtubule segment i ∈ C as a node
in a graph with an associated position pi = (xi, yi, zi). A priori we do not know
which microtubule segments i ∈ C belong together and form a microtubule.
Thus, we connect all microtubule candidates with each other that are below a
certain distance threshold θd. More formally, we introduce an undirected graph
G = (V, E), where V = C ∪ {S} is the set of microtubule candidate segments
C augmented with a special node S and E ⊂ V × V is the set of possible links
between them. The special node S is used to mark the beginning or end of a
microtubule track and is connected to all candidates in C. We further deﬁne a
set T = {(i, j, k) ∈ V × C × V | (i, j), (j, k) ∈ E, i (cid:54)= k} of all directly connected
triplets on G.

As observed in [4], we can make use of the fact that microtubules do not
branch and have limited curvature [8]. We encode these priors as constraints
and costs respectively, and solve the resulting optimization problem with an
ILP. As outlined in Fig. 2, and in contrast to [4], we formulate consistency and

”no-branch” constraints on triplets of connected nodes (i, j, k) ∈ T only, leading
to an orders of magnitude improvement in ILP solve time (see Fig. 4). To this
end, we introduce a binary indicator variable Ii,j,k ∈ {0, 1} for each (i, j, k) ∈ T
and deﬁne selection costs ci,j,k for each triplet by propagating costs ci on nodes
and ci,j on edges as follows:
(cid:26) θS if i = S
θP else

ci,j = θD dist(i, j) + θE evid(i, j) + ci + cj
ci,j,k = θC curv(i, j, k) + ci,j + cj,k

ci =

(1)

,

where θS is the cost for beginning/ending a track and θP < 0 is the prior on
node selection. dist(i, j) = ||pi − pj|| measures the distance between candidates
i and j, whereas evid(i, j) = (cid:80)
m(p) accumulates the predicted evidence
for microtubules on all voxels on a line Pi,j connecting i and j. curv(i, j, k) =
π−∠(i, j, k) measures deviations of a 180 degree angle between two pairs of edges,
and thus introduces a cost on curvature. The values θS, θP , θD, θE, θC ∈ R are
free parameters of the method and found via grid search on a validation dataset.

p∈Pi,j

2.4 Blockwise Processing

In order to be able to apply the constraint optimization to arbitrary sized vol-
umes, we decompose the candidate graph spatially into a set of blocks B. For
each block b ∈ B, we deﬁne a constant-size context region b, which encloses the
block and is chosen to be large enough such that decisions outside the context
region are unlikely to change the ILP solution inside the block. We next iden-
tify sets Si ⊂ B of blocks that are pairwise conﬂict free, where we deﬁne two
blocks a and b to be in conﬂict if a overlaps with b. All blocks of a subset Si can
then be distributed and processed in parallel. The corresponding ILP for each
block b ∈ Si is solved within b, however, assignments of the binary indicators
are only stored for indicators corresponding to nodes in b. To obtain consistent
solutions across block boundaries, existing indicator assignments from previous
runs of conﬂicting blocks are acknowledged by adding additional constraints to
the block ILP. See supplement for an illustration.

2.5 Evaluation

To evaluate reconstructed tracks against groundtruth, we resample both recon-
struction and groundtruth tracks equidistantly and match nodes based on dis-
tance using Hungarian matching. Results are reported in terms of precision and
recall on edges, which we consider correct if they connect two matched nodes
that are matched to the same track.

NMS SM uses a 3D UNet predicting microtubule score only, NMS GRAD ad-

For each, we ﬁrst select the best performing UNet architecture (for NMS RFC
we interactively train an RFC using Ilastik [18]) and NMS candidate extraction
threshold in terms of recovered candidates on the validation datasets, followed
by a grid search over the distance threshold θd and ILP parameters for 150 diﬀer-
ent parameter combinations. For the NMS candidate extraction we use a window
size of 1x10x10 voxels for the ﬁrst NMS pass to oﬀset the anisotropic resolution
of 40x4x4 nm. For the second NMS pass we use a window size of 1x3x3 voxels,

3.3 Test Results

Fig. 4 shows that both variants of our proposed model outperform the prior
state of the art [4] substantially. Averaged over test data sets A,B,C, we demon-
strate a 53% increase in accuracy for NMS GRAD. Table 1 further shows test
best F1 scores for each individual dataset. In accordance with the qualitative
results shown in Fig. 3, NMS GRAD performs substantially better for test set
A while NMS SM is more accurate for volumes B and C. Ablation experiments
show that CC candidate extraction leads to overall less accurate reconstructions.
Exchanging the UNet with an RFC while retaining NMS candidate extraction
seriously harms performance, resulting in large numbers of false positive detec-
tions. For extended qualitative results, including reconstruction of microtubules

4 Discussion

Although some of our improvements in accuracy can be attributed to the use
of a deep learning classiﬁer, the presented method relies mostly on an eﬀective
way of incorporating biological priors in the form of constraint optimization. In
particular our ablation studies (CC GRAD) show that the strided NMS-based
candidate extraction method positively impacts accuracy: Since a single micro-
tubule could potentially extend far in the x-y imaging plane, it is not suﬃcient
to represent candidates in one plane by a single node, as done in [4]. The strided
NMS detections homogenize the candidate graph and likely allow transferring
our method to datasets of diﬀerent resolutions. A potential downside is poor pre-
cision when combined with extremely noisy microtubule score predictions m (see
NMS RFC). In this case NMS on a grid extracts too many candidate segments,
and besides structural priors, the only remaining cost we use to extract ﬁnal mi-
crotubule tracks is directly derived from the (noisy) predicted microtubule score
m (see equation (1)). Note that the baseline does not suﬀer as much from noisy
microtubule scores, because it uses a ﬁxed orientation prior and is thus limited
to a subset of microtubules in any given volume. Finally, the reformulation of the
ILP and the block-wise processing scheme result in a dramatic speed-up and the
ability to perform distributed, consistent tracking, which is required to process
petabyte-sized datasets.
