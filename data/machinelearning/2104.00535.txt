Abstract

We present a data-driven optimization framework for redesigning police patrol zones
in an urban environment. The objectives are to rebalance police workload among geo-
graphical areas and to reduce response time to emergency calls. We develop a stochastic
model for police emergency response by integrating multiple data sources, including
police incidents reports, demographic surveys, and traﬃc data. Using this stochastic
model, we optimize zone redesign plans using mixed-integer linear programming. Our
proposed design was implemented by the Atlanta Police Department in March 2019.
By analyzing data before and after the zone redesign, we show that the new design
has reduced the response time to high-priority 911 calls by 5.8% and the imbalance of
police workload among diﬀerent zones by 43%.

Introduction

In large urban areas, police departments often organize their patrol forces by dividing the geo-
graphical region of a city into multiple patrol areas called zones (or precincts), and each zone is
further divided into smaller areas called beats (or sectors) (Larson 1972). The design of patrol
zones aﬀects both the demand and the capacity for police services in each zone and beat, as well
as the travel time of patrol units—together, these factors will determine the police’s response time
to emergency calls and crime events. Therefore, the design of patrol zones has a critical impact on
the eﬃciency of police operations.

In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for designing police zones. The work is
developed based on our collaboration with the Atlanta Police Department (APD) for redesigning
police zones in Atlanta through a project that lasted from 2017 to 2019. The APD is the primary
police force in metro Atlanta, the ninth-largest metropolitan area in the United States and home to
6 million people. The APD divides the geographical area of Atlanta into six zones and 81 beats (see
Figure 1). One police patrol unit is usually assigned to each beat to patrol that area and respond
to 911 calls. If the response unit is busy handling another incident, available patrol units in other
beats of the same zone will be dispatched to answer calls. Therefore, all patrol units in the same

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
zone can back up for each other, but they typically do not travel across the zone boundaries unless
there is a major incident. Under this dispatching policy, each zone can be modeled as a spatially
distributed queueing system (Larson 1974a, Larson and Odoni 1981).

Figure 1: Atlanta police zone and beat design (prior to the redesign in March 2019). Note:
Gray dashed lines represent the boundaries of the six zones. White lines represent the
boundaries of the beats. The color in each beat indicates the average police workload level
in 2017 (in seconds).

The previous zone and beat conﬁguration in Atlanta (Figure 1) was designed in 2011. Since
then, Atlanta has experienced signiﬁcant population growth and urban development. The U.S.
Census Bureau estimated that the population of Atlanta has increased by 15.8% from 2010 to 2017
(United States Census Bureau 2018). The population growth led to an increase in police workload,
which was exacerbated by the diﬃculty faced by the APD in oﬃcer recruitment and retention. In
2018, the average response time to high-priority 911 calls (e.g., violent crimes) in Atlanta was 9.5
minutes, which was above the national average (Fritz 2018). Moreover, changing demographics and
traﬃc patterns in Atlanta created uneven police workloads among diﬀerent regions. The colors in
Figure 1 indicate the average workload in each beat, which we compiled from the 911 police incident
report data in 2017. A higher workload in a beat often led to longer 911 call response time. For
example, Zone 2, which is located in North Atlanta, had a higher than average workload due to its
recent commercial development. From the police report data, we found that the average response
time for high-priority calls (e.g., carjacks or burglaries) was 13.5 minutes in Zone 2, whereas the
average response time citywide for high-priority calls was 9.5 minutes. During the same period,
Zone 2, a historically low-crime area, has experienced a rising number of car thefts, burglaries, and
armed robberies (Habersham and Deere 2019).

The challenge faced by the Atlanta Police Department motivated us to develop a rigorous
quantitative method using operations research for redesigning police zones. The general methods
we proposed can also be applied to other urban regions facing similar problems.

2 Background of Police Operations

Police departments usually divide the geographical areas of a city into several zones, and further-
more each zone is comprised of several beats. For example, Atlanta is currently divided into 6

2

zones and 81 beats (Atlanta Police Department 2020). New York City, which has the largest police
department in the U.S., contains 77 precincts (comparable to zones) and 302 sectors (comparable
to beats) (New York City Government 2020). Many cities, including Atlanta and New York City,
have ﬁxed patrol districts, although in some other cities the districting design may be changed
during a 24-hour period if there are signiﬁcant changes in the pattern of calls throughout the day.
We assume the zone districting is ﬁxed over time in this paper.

Typically, one police patrol unit (e.g., a patrol car) is assigned to each beat, where the unit has
primary responsibility. When a patrol unit is not busy serving any active calls, it traverses its home
beat to perform preventive patrol. If an emergency call is received, the dispatcher will try to send
an available unit in the zone to the location of the reported incident. As a result, a patrol unit may
be dispatched to any location within its zone, possibly outside its home beat. If all units in that
zone are busy, the call must wait in a queue until a patrol unit becomes available later. We treat
each zone as an independent system since in practice, there are very few dispatches across zone
boundaries, due to both long travel time and administrative diﬃculty (Larson 1972). In line with
practice, we also make several assumptions on the dispatching rule summarized in Appendix A.

Figure 2: The timeline to process a police incident.

The typical timeline of a reported incident is as follows (see an illustration in Figure 2): When
a 911 call arrives, the dispatcher will try to assign an available patrol unit in the zone to process
that incident. If all patrol units are busy, the request needs to wait in a queue until at least one
unit in that zone becomes available. We refer to the duration between the call arrival time and
the dispatch time as the waiting time. Once dispatched, the patrol unit travels from its current
location to the location of the reported incident. The response time is thus the sum of the waiting
time and the travel time. After arriving at the scene, the amount of time spent on processing the
incident is referred to as the on-scene time. The service time for the patrol units to process that
incident, which we use to calculate the workload, is equal to the sum of the travel time and the
on-scene time.

3 Relation to Existing Literature

The study of police zone design and police patrol operations has an extensive history dating back to
the 1960s. The books by Larson (1972), R´ıos-Mercado (2020) and the survey papers by Chaiken and
Larson (1972), Green and Kolesar (2004) provide a comprehensive summary of this ﬁeld. Below,
we review the related literature from three aspects: crime prediction, stochastic modeling of police
operations, and optimization for police patrol zones.

Prediction. Big data and analytics techniques have gain popularity in policing over the last
two decades. Several large police departments in the U.S. have been experimenting with predictive
policing that uses historical crime data to predict future crime activities (Perry et al. 2013). For
example, Levine et al. (2017) reported the implementation of a predictive policing system by the

prescribe how predictive crime forecasts should be translated into police’s operational decisions.
Saunders et al. (2016) analyzed the predictive policing program of the Chicago Police Department
using a quasi-experiment and found that the eﬀect of predictive policing was not statistically
signiﬁcant. The practice of predictive policing has also drawn criticisms from civil rights groups
for proliferating racial proﬁling (Edwards 2016).

Stochastic Modeling. Police emergency response systems can be viewed as queueing systems
where servers and customers are distributed in space, and servers must travel to customer locations.
Larson (1974a) proposed a hypercube queueing model for urban emergency services. This hyper-
cube queue model is also studied in Chelst and Jarvis (1979), Larson and Odoni (1981). Bammi
(1975) considered a beat allocation model where the beat design is ﬁxed, but the patrol units can
be moved or shared among diﬀerent beats.

Optimization. Gass (1968) is one of the earliest works that study optimal police beat allocation
using integer programming. Mitchell (1972) studied an optimal beat selection problem. Bodily
(1978) considered fairness issues of police zone design. Benveniste (1985) proposed a stochastic
optimization model that combines zoning and facility location. More recently, Curtin et al. (2005,
2010) proposed maximal covering models for police patrol area design. Cheung et al. (2015), Chow
et al. (2015) considered facility location models for police operations. Bucarey et al. (2015) for-
mulated the police districting problem as an enriched p-median model. Camacho-Collados et al.
(2015), Liberatore and Camacho-Collados (2016) introduced a multi-criteria police districting prob-
lem that provides a balance between eﬃciency and workload homogeneity. Piyadasun et al. (2017)
considered redesigning police patrol beats by clustering methods. Chen et al. (2019) proposed a
street-level design for urban police districting. Implementations of police zone redesign have been
reported for Boston, MA (Larson 1974b), Buﬀalo, NY (Sarac et al. 1999), and Tucson, AZ (Kistler
2009).

Unlike most of the existing literature that focuses on one of the three aspects above, our
paper presents a comprehensive framework that integrates prediction, stochastic modeling, and
optimization for the police zone design problem. We apply this framework to police zone redesign
in Atlanta and evaluate the eﬀect of the redesign.

Aside from the police zone design problem, other types of geographical districting problems
have also been studied in the operations research literature, including political districting (Hess
et al. 1965, Garﬁnkel and Nemhauser 1970) and school districting (Ferland and Gu´enette 1990).
Several papers (Weaver and Hess. 1963, Mills 1967, Morrill 1973, 1976, Vickrey 1961, D’Amico
et al. 2002) apply meta-heuristics for geographical districting. These studies consider design cri-
teria such as contiguity (Grofman 1985, Mills 1967, Garﬁnkel and Nemhauser 1970, Nagel 1972,
Mehrotra et al. 1998, Vickrey 1961) and compactness (Garﬁnkel and Nemhauser 1970, Niemi 1990,
Yong 1988).
In this paper, we use a network ﬂow based formulation by Shirabe (2009) to im-
pose contiguity constraints. However, the political districting problem and the school districting
problem have diﬀerent objectives than police districting. Political districting and school districting
are often formulated as deterministic optimization problems, but police districting must take into
under uncertainty associated with crime occurrence and police service time. Speciﬁcally, our model
considers a police patrol system that has multiple moving servers (i.e., patrol units). The workload
for each server is stochastic, and the servers’ status depends on each other. In addition, changes to
the zone conﬁguration will impact the operational dynamics of the zone, including the travel time
of servers and the number of 911 calls that need to be served.

4 Proposed Method: Data Driven Police Zone Design

We propose a data-driven modeling and optimization framework for redesigning police patrol zones.
This framework integrates statistical prediction for emergency call arrivals, stochastic modeling of
police dispatching process, and optimization for zone redesign in an end-to-end design process.
The methodological contribution of this paper is threefold: (a) We create a stochastic queueing
system for police operations in Atlanta; the system consists of six interdependent queueing models
(each model corresponds to one particular zone), which captures the intra-zone dynamics and the
inter-zone eﬀects when the zone design is changed. (b) The parameters of the stochastic system
are estimated using real police data; the arrival rates of 911 calls across the city are modeled by a
spatio-temporal process. (c) To optimize the zone design using this stochastic model, we overcome
the computational challenge by approximating the objective using simulation optimization and
ﬁnding locally optimal solutions by heuristic search. A summary of this framework is illustrated in
Figure 3. Next, we describe each component of the framework.

Figure 3: An illustration for the data-driven optimization framework of police zone redesign.

4.1 Module I. Stochastic Model for Police Patrol and Emergency

Response

The basis of our design process is a stochastic model for the police’s response to 911 calls and
processing time. For a ﬁxed zone conﬁguration, the dynamics of patrol units in each zone are
independent, since we assume patrol units do not respond to requests from a diﬀerent zone than
they are assigned. Within each zone, the movement and workload of patrol units are quite complex,
as they are determined jointly by the zone design, the dispatch rule, and the beat-to-beat travel
time.

We model emergency response operations based on the hypercube queue model (Larson 1974a);
see Appendix B for details. The system state depends on the status of all the patrol units in this
zone and the number of calls in the queue to be processed. Consider the state as a vector of binary
numbers, where each element of the vector represents the status of the corresponding unit: the unit
is busy processing a call if the corresponding digit of the state equals 1 and otherwise 0. Based on
whether there is any available unit, the state space can be divided into two parts: (a) unsaturated
states: the states where the queue for unprocessed calls is empty. These states can be represented
by a hypercube, where each vertex corresponds to a state. (b) saturated states: the states where the
queue for unprocessed calls is non-empty. By deﬁnition, all patrol units are busy under saturated
states. An example with three patrol units is shown in Figure 4.

We deﬁne the system dynamics using a transition rate matrix based on call arrival rates, travel
time, and service rates. There are two classes of transitions on the hypercube: upward transitions

that change a unit’s status from idle to busy; downward transitions that do the reverse. The
downward transition rate from one state to its adjacent states is always the service rate. The
upward transition rates, however, will depend on the dispatch rule when a call is received and
the travel time between beats. We assume that when a call is ready to be processed, the nearest
available unit with the minimum mean travel time to the location of the call is dispatched.

The steady-state probabilities of this system deﬁne the likelihood that each state is occupied in
the long run, which can be determined by solving the balance equations. We note that although
the number of saturated states is inﬁnite, it can be expressed in closed-form as in an M/M/c queue.
The main challenge for computing the steady-state distribution is that the number of unsaturated
states on the hypercube grows exponentially with the number of beats. We developed an eﬃcient
computation method to approximate the steady-state distribution by exploiting the fact that the
transition rate matrix is sparse.

4.2 Module II. Model Estimation and Prediction

We estimate the parameters of the hypercube queue model using data provided by the Atlanta
Police Department (APD) and public data sources. We ﬁrst describe the datasets that we used for
estimation. Then we describe our call arrival rate and workload prediction method.

4.2.1 Data Sets.

We have utilized two key data sets for police workload prediction:

1. 911 Call Data: the APD has electronic records of police reports, where each record consists
of detailed information about a 911 call, such as the call time, dispatch time, arrive time,
clear time, and location. These reports also provided travel information of each dispatch,
including a departure time and location, and an arrival time and location. Using this data
set, we estimate the average travel time between beats, the 911 call arrival rates for each
beat, and the service rate of patrol units.

2. American Community Survey: the U.S. Census Bureau provides an annual American Com-
munity Survey (ACS), which includes comprehensive information about the population, de-
mographic, and economic status of diﬀerent areas in Atlanta. We use population, number of

housing unit, school enrollment, median household income, median number of rooms, media
age, median house price, and average year built from the ACS as explanatory variables in
our predictive model.

4.2.2 Call Arrival Rate Prediction.

We cannot use standard stochastic processes to model 911 call arrivals, because the arrival rates
have a signiﬁcant seasonality pattern and yearly trend; the rate also have a strong spatial correlation
among adjacent geographical areas. Therefore, we propose a spatio-temporal model to predict call
arrival rates using spatially lagged endogenous regressors (Rosen 1974). We assume that the 911
call arrival rate of a beat depends on (a) the arrival rates of adjacent beats, (b) the arrival rate
of the same beat in the previous year, and (c) the demographic factors in the past ﬁve years. We
also assume that the noise term has a spatial structure, where the covariance between two beats is
determined by an exponential kernel function. The parameters of the model are ﬁtted by maximum
likelihood estimation. See Appendix C for details.

4.2.3 On-scene Time Estimation.

As we assume the on-scene time of a response unit is independent of its service region, we analyze
the distribution of average on-scene time for all units in the same zone. We have observed from
data that the on-scene time of response units ﬁts to an exponential distribution shown in Figure 5.

4.2.4 Travel Time Estimation.

We estimated the travel time between beats from the 911 call dispatch data. The estimation result
is shown in Figure 6.

4.2.5 Performance Metrics.

Using the steady-state distribution of the hypercube queue model with estimated model parameters,
we can derive several key performance measures (See Appendix B for details), which will guide our

zone design decisions in the next step:

• Expected Travel Time. The travel time for a dispatch is aﬀected by both the beat-to-beat
travel time and the fraction of dispatches. The fraction of dispatches critically depends on
the utilization factor of the hypercube queue system. If the utilization is low, most calls can
be processed by units close to their home beats, resulting in a shorter travel time. However,
if the system is congested, calls must wait in the queue, which will be processed by the ﬁrst
unit available. This will lead to a longer travel time.

• Response Time. The response time for a call includes both the travel time for the patrol unit
to arrive at the scene and the possible waiting time if the call incurs a positive queue delay.

• Patrol Unit Workload. The workload of one patrol unit is the sum of the steady-state prob-
abilities for all the states where this unit is busy. The total workload for all patrol units in
the zone is simply the aggregation of individual unit workloads.

4.2.6 Model Validation.

To evaluate the predictive accuracy of the estimated police zone workload, we compare the real
zone workload reported by historical data with the out-of-sample zone workload simulation from
our operations model using leave-one-out cross-validation. Speciﬁcally, the operations model takes
the 911 calls arrival rates, the police service rate, and beat-to-beat travel time in a particular year
as input variables and generate the simulated police workload for each zone using the existing
zone design.
In practice, we estimate these input quantities using the data from the past ﬁve
years. Figure 7 shows comparisons for the average workload between zones and averaged workload
between years. To carry out the evaluation for each zone/year in Figure 7, the model estimation
is performed using all data except for one zone/year, and a prediction is made for that zone/year.
The result shows that the simulation is consistent with the real data, and the percentage diﬀerence
is less than 6.7%.

The operations model allows us to quantify the impact of an arbitrary zone design on the zone
workload analytically. However, it cannot be used to search for an improved zone design eﬃciently
due to the randomness and the non-linear structures of zone workloads with respect to decisions.

in the optimization.

4.3 Module III. Zone Design Optimization

We develop an optimization model for zone redesign. We assume that the shape of the beats are
ﬁxed, so the zone design problem can be formulated as a graph partition problem, where we allocate
the beats to a pre-determined number of zones.

Diﬀerent objectives have been studied in the literature for police zone design (see Appendix D).
After several discussions with the Atlanta Police Department, we learned that their primary concern
is the workload imbalance among diﬀerent geographical areas, as they have observed a trend of
police overwork in some zones. In particular, longer shifts and police oﬃcer fatigue may lead to a
host of public safety issues and aﬀect the police department’s budget (in the form of bonuses and
overtime). Therefore, in this paper, we follow the zone workload deﬁnition introduced by Mitchell
(1972) and choose the objective function as the workload variance among diﬀerent zones, which
quantitatively measures the police workload imbalance among zones. This metric was also used
internally by APD to measure previous zone redistricting plans (Egbert 2016). The optimization
model aims to minimize the workload imbalance across zones subject to some shape constraints
for each zone, such as contiguity and compactness. The full optimization model is included in
Appendix E.

4.3.1 Zone-level Workload Approximation.

A key challenge for solving the optimization problem is characterizing the complex dependence
between the zone design and the zone-level workload. In theory, the expected workload in each
zone can be computed using the hypercube queue model given any zone design. However, it is
impractical to carry out such computation to search for an improved zone design since the decision
space is extremely large. For example, with the six zones and 81 beats in Atlanta, this will generate
1059 possible zone designs, where each zone design corresponds to a separate
more than 2.4
×
queueing model.

To tackle this challenge, we consider a local linear approximation of the workload function and
then use the approximated value in the objective function of the optimization model, which allows
the objective function of the optimization problem to be expressed explicitly without repeatedly
computing the hypercube queue model. This linear approximation represents the ﬁrst-order Taylor
expansion of the workload change when the current zone design is modiﬁed slightly by adding a few
beats or removing a few beats. In Appendix E, we discuss the detailed process of generating this
linear approximation and validating the eﬀectiveness of our approximation method using randomly
selected out-of-sample designs.

4.3.2 Contiguity and Compactness Constraints.

In addition to balancing the police workload, the shapes of zones should be contiguous and compact.
Since patrol units almost always travel within a zone, a narrow or snakelike shape increases the
travel time and reduces the eﬃciency of patrol operations and emergency response. Therefore,
we formulate the contiguity and compactness criteria using binary variables and a set of linear
constraints, which requires that beats in the same zone to be geographically connected and close
to each other; see Appendix E for details.

9

4.3.3 MILP Formulation and Local Search.

With the linear approximation of the zone workload, the objective function measuring the work-
load variance becomes a quadratic function of the binary decision variables. Using the McCormick
envelopes technique in integer programming (McCormick 1976), this quadratic function can be ex-
pressed equivalently as a linear form. The reformulated mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
1059
model contains more than 240,000 variables and has a huge solution space with more than 2.4
possible solutions.

×

Based on the feedback from APD, we also consider a practical constraint that beat changes
should be as few as possible. A drastic zone design change is undesirable for two reasons: First,
a large-scale operational change will result in high implementation costs; second, a radical design
change will usually face signiﬁcant uncertainties and unpredictable risks in the future operation.
For this reason, we only consider plans with no more than six beat changes. Moreover, two speciﬁc
design requirements were suggested by APD and included as constraints in our model: (a) beat
305, 111 should be staying in zone 3 and 1, respectively; (b) zone 3 will not take any existing beat
from zone 4.

In order to ﬁnd a near optimal solution to the MILP eﬃciently and avoid limit the number of
beat changes from the existing design, we use a local search method based on simulated annealing.
The optimization process takes about 30 to 50 minutes on a standard laptop with a quad-core 4.7
GHz processor.

Implementation Results

During a one-year collaboration between Georgia Tech and APD, we used our data-driven zone
design framework as a decision support tool and implemented a zone reconﬁguration plan. In the
following, we ﬁrst discuss the police workload imbalance analysis using real and predicted results;
then we present our zone redistricting plan and the major changes we made to the original zone
conﬁguration; we also discuss the implementation’s impact; lastly, we investigate the eﬀectiveness
of the proposed plan by analyzing the post-implementation data.

5.1 Workload Imbalance Analysis

Under the previous zone design in Atlanta, the workload imbalance across zones had worsened in
the past few years. This imbalance is partly due to the growth and redistribution of population,
as well as changing (mostly worsening) traﬃc conditions. Here, we analyze how zone conﬁguration
aﬀects the workload imbalance over the years, and predict the future trend if there is no change in
the conﬁguration. To quantify the imbalance of workload, we use the variance of workload across
zones as the metric.

We compiled the actual workload from the year 2014 to 2017 (the most recent year at the time
of our redesign process) from the police report data, and computed the predicted workload for the
year 2018 and 2019 using the stochastic queue model we developed earlier. The workload in each
beat is displayed on the city map in Figure 8. One can observe a clear trend that both the mean
and the variance of workload were growing up to 2017, and would continue to grow according to
our model prediction. Moreover, the workload was exceptionally high in several concentrated areas,
such as Buckhead in Zone 2, Midtown in Zone 5, and the intersection of highway I-285 and highway
I-20 in Zone 4.

In Figure 9, we plot the total workload of the entire city (red curve) and the workload imbalance

5.2 Zone Reconﬁguration

Using the queueing and optimization models developed earlier in this paper, we proposed a new
police zone plan for Atlanta. Our analysis report in 2018 contained beat-wise workload prediction
for the next two years (2018 and 2019) and proposed three candidate designs with similar beat
shifts that all attain improved workload balance. In Table 1, we list the predicted annual workload
in each zone, total workload, and workload variance. After our proposed plan was reported to the
police, several follow-up meetings were held to elicit feedback from the APD and deliberate various
design trade-oﬀs. The APD Deputy Chief and other senior police oﬃcers also participated in these
discussions and provided feedback. After several rounds of discussions, the police chose one of our
proposed designs as the new police zone conﬁguration. The new design and the previous design
are shown in Figure 10. This particular design was selected for three major reasons: (a) this plan
would only change four beats, so it has fewer beat shifts in comparison with other candidate plans;
(b) Beat 203 and 213 are two areas with relatively low police workload in zone 2, so moving them
out of zone 2 may help focus their police resources on curbing the crime surge in the Buckhead
area (the center of zone 2); (c) Zone 3 and Zone 4 have maintained a good operational balance for
the recent years; keeping these two zones intact can also help reduce the implementation cost of
the plan. For both predictions in 2018 and 2019, the redesigned zone plan has a more balanced
workload distribution over the six zones (the colors in Figures 10 (c) and 10 (d) are more uniform).
The new design is projected to reduce the workload variance signiﬁcantly by 62.79% and 55.97%
in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

5.3 Implementation and Impact

In January 2019, we submitted the ﬁnal report for zone redesign to the Atlanta Police Department,
which the Police Chief and her team reviewed. Our report analyzed the annual growth trend of
police workload and proposed a detailed redistricting plan. Our redistricting plan involves changing
four zones: Zone 6 in East Atlanta will increase by four square miles. Zone 1 in Northwest Atlanta
will increase by two square miles. Zone 2, which covers Northeast Atlanta and Buckhead, decreases
by seven square miles. Zone 5 also has some minor changes. The detailed plan is shown in Figure 10.
Overall, the redistricting would rebalance the police workload between the four zones and reduced
the average response time in Zone 2 (Habersham 2019).

In February 2019, Atlanta’s City Council voted to approve our proposed redistricting plan. The
Atlanta Police Department oﬃcially implemented the plan on March 17, 2019. In a statement about
this redesign (Atlanta Police Department 2019), the APD Deputy Chief Jeﬀ Glazier stated: “It is

Figure 10: Comparison of zone workload distribution between the existing plan and the
redesigned plan: for 2018 and 2019 (based on prediction), respectively. The color depth of
each zone represents the level of its annual workload. Beat shifts in the redesigned plans
have been highlighted by red dash lines. As we can see, for the predicted year 2018 and
2019, the redesigned plan achieves a more balanced workload across zones comparing to the
existing plan.

important that we examine our oﬃcer workload periodically, and with the help of Georgia Tech,
we were able to do so in a data-driven manner. We are conﬁdent these changes will balance the
workload in all zones.” The new zone design was also covered by several media outlets, including
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the largest daily newspaper in the metro Atlanta area. On social
media, many residents praised the change and thanked the APD and the Georgia Tech team for
the new plan (Rosete 2019).

5.4 Post-Implementation Analysis

∼

March 2019) to the post-implementation period (March 2019

In August 2020, we received a new set of 911 call data provided by the Atlanta Police Department
thanks to Major John Quigley’s help. This dataset contains records from the pre-implementation
period (March 2017
March 2020).
Note that we excluded the data after March 2020 because police operations had been drastically
aﬀected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the citywide lockdown. Also, due to the inconsistency
between the new data format and the previous data format, we normalized the new data set by
bringing the workload of each zone in the overlapping period (i.e., Year 2017) to the same level.
Using this dataset, we evaluate the zone-level workload distribution and variance before and after
the implementation. Apart from the workload analysis, we also focus on three other metrics as we
described in the background section, namely, waiting time, travel time, and response time. (We
do not study on-scene time since it is exogenous to the zone design.) In particular, response time
is important for the perception of police operations eﬃciency by the general public and directly
reﬂects the eﬀectiveness of the districting plan.

Figure 11: Zone-level average workloads before and after the redesign. The beats changed
in the redesigned plans are highlighted by red dash lines.

In Table 2 and Figure 11, we show the average workload of each zone and their variances before
and after the redesign in March 2019. It is evident that our redesign successfully mitigated the
workload increase rate and reduced the deterioration of workload imbalance: the workload variance
of 2019 decreased by 43.54% comparing to 2018. For Zone 2, a region with rapidly increasing crime
rates and a focus of this redesign, the analysis shows that our new plan has reduced its police
workload by 7.25% compared to 2018.

We also report the average response time, waiting time, and travel time for all 911 calls and
high-priority calls (e.g., serious crimes) in Tables 4 and 3. All three time metrics have worsened from
March 2018 to March 2019, the year before the zone redesign, as a result of economic development
and population growth. After the new zone design was implemented, all three metrics have seen
decreased growth rates. For high-priority calls, in particular, these time metrics have decreased
signiﬁcantly.
In Figure 12, we also show the distributions of the three metrics for high-priority
calls; the redesign has resulted in the probability density shifting left toward zero.

waiting time (green), and travel time (blue). Each point represents one day of the year. The
x-axis corresponds to the variance diﬀerence for the two years prior to the redesign, and the
y-axis corresponds to the variance diﬀerence for the two years before and after the redesign.
The 45-degree dashed line passes through the origin. Points below the dashed line indicate
in a reduction in variance increase.

To control for the time series eﬀect, we also perform a diﬀerence in diﬀerence (DID) analysis for
the yearly variance change of the three time metrics. We calculate the variance of these metrics on
each day of the year and then compute the variance diﬀerence between two years. We then compare
the variance diﬀerence before and after the redesign. In Figure 13, we report this comparison for
the entire Atlanta. For travel time, the result shows that the variance diﬀerence after the redesign
is signiﬁcantly lower than the diﬀerence before the redesign, as most points are below the 45-degree
line. For response and waiting time, the ﬁgure also shows a slight decrease after the redesign. In
Figure 14, we show the same comparison for each zone separately. For Zones 2, 3, and 4, which have
experienced upticks in crime rates and police workloads (see Figure 11), the variance diﬀerences
for all three metrics have decreased.

6 Final Remarks

In this paper, we presented a data-driven framework for police zone redesign. The framework in-
cludes three main components: a spatial queueing model for police patrol and emergency response
operations, a statistical model to predict emergency call arrivals and police service rates, and a

mixed-integer linear programming model for zone districting optimization. We applied this frame-
work to redesigning police zones in Atlanta. The Atlanta Police Department oﬃcially adopted our
proposed redesign plan in March 2019. By analyzing data before and after the zone redesign, we
show that the new design has reduced the response time to high-priority 911 calls by 5.8% and the
imbalance of police workload among diﬀerent zones by 43%.

We note several potential limitations in our method that can be improved in future research:
(a) our model assumes that the occurrence of crime events and 911 calls are exogenous to the police
zone design; however, we observe in the post-implementation data that the call rates changed after
the zone redesign, which imply that these factors may be endogenous and aﬀected by the zone
redesign; (b) our method assumes that beat designs are ﬁxed, and hence the zone design problem
can be formulated as an assignment problem. For a complete redesign, beat designs and zone
designs can be optimized jointly.

A Key Assumptions on Dispatching Rule

We make the following assumptions on the dispatching rule: (a) The number of patrol units al-
located to each zone is equal to the number of beats; for simplicity, we do not consider backup
units. (b) In response to each call for police service, the nearest available patrol unit is dispatched
to the scene of the request; a major incident may require multiple patrol units to respond, but
we ignore such possibility since these incidents are rare. (c) If no unit is available in the zone of
the request, the call enters a queue with other backlogged calls, which is processed according to
the ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-served (FIFO) rule. (d) Upon completion of the service, a patrol unit is either
dispatched to a call waiting in the queue, or it immediately returns to its home beat if the queue
is empty. In the formulation of the stochastic model below, we assume returning to the home beat
is instantaneous.

B Police Patrol and Emergency Response Model

In this section, we present a stochastic model for the police patrol and emergency responses. First
we model the patrol units as a queueing system; then we derive expressions for several performance
measures. The notations deﬁned in this section are summarized in Table 5.

The system state depends on the status of all the units in this zone, and the number of calls
in queue to be processed. Based on whether there is any available unit, the state space (denoted
by C(k)) can be divided into two parts: (1) unsaturated states: the states where the queue for
unprocessed calls is empty. These states can be represented by a hypercube in dimension N (k)
(hence the name “hypercube queue model”). Each vertex of the hypercube corresponds to a state
B(k) = (bi)i∈I (k), where unit i is busy processing a call if bi = 1 and idle if bi = 0. Considering the
(k)
state B(k) as a vector of binary numbers, we index the state by its corresponding decimal form B
n
where n = (cid:80)N (k)
j=1 2j−1bj. (2) saturated states: the states where the queue for unprocessed calls is
non-empty. By deﬁnition, all patrol units are busy under saturated states. We denote these states
by

There are two classes of transitions on the hypercube: upward transitions that change a unit’s

We note that although the number of saturated states is inﬁnite, it can be expressed in closed-
form as in an M/M/c queue. The main challenge for computing the steady-state distribution is that
the number of unsaturated states on the hypercube grows exponentially with the number of beats.
In the following, we will propose an eﬃcient computation method to approximate the steady-state
distribution, which exploits the fact that the hypercube queue model has a sparse transition matrix.

B.2 Measures of Performance

Fraction of Dispatches. To understand how often a patrol unit travels to diﬀerent beats in the
zone, it is critical to know how many calls in each beat have been assigned to a given unit. The

Expected Travel Time. Another key measure of performance is the travel time that a unit takes
for a single dispatch. The travel time is aﬀected by both the beat-to-beat travel time τij and the
(k)
fraction of dispatches ρ
ij . The beat-to-beat time T = (τij) can be estimated from the real traﬃc
data, which will be discussed later. The fraction of dispatches critically depends on the utilization
factor of the hypercube queue system. If the utilization is low, most calls can be processed by units
close to their home beats, resulting in short travel time. However, if the system is congested, calls
must wait in the queue, which will be processed in an FCFS basis. Each patrol unit is equally
likely to process calls that incur a queue delay, regardless of their locations. This will lead to longer
travel time.

To derive the equation for the expected travel time for zone k

K , we denote the expected
, the expected travel time for a call in beat j as
, and the zone-wide mean travel time as ¯T (k). Using the result in the fraction of dispatches,
can be expressed as the weighted sum of mean travel times τij for all beats j in zone k given

Patrol Unit Workload. Finally, we consider the workload of the patrol units in each zone. In the
following optimization model, we will consider districting designs that balance the workload across
zones, so this metric will play a vital role in deﬁning the optimization objective. The workload of
patrol unit i in zone k is

Note that the workload for zone k depends on the decision variable D through I (k). A detailed

Dependence of Performance Measures on the Districting Decision. A zone districting decision D
divides the entire geographical region into K police zone, or K hypercube queue models. The
dynamics between the above performance measures and the beat-to-zone allocations are quite
complex, as the parameters of K hypercube queues are endogenously determined by the decision
of beat allocation. As shown in Figure 16, the police zone workload w(k)(D) depends on decision
D through a long dependence chain. Speciﬁcally, given a particular decision D, the beats will be

B.3 Eﬃcient Computation Method

Performing workload estimation eﬃciently is critical to search for the optimal zone design in the
solution space. Take Atlanta as an example; there are more than 2,000 possible ways to shift the

particular design corresponds to a unique hypercube queue, where its zone workload needs to be
re-evaluated separately.

A critical step for obtaining police zone workload estimation given a decision is to compute the

steady-state distribution.

Let λ(k) = (cid:80)

i∈I (k) λi be the total call arrival rate in zone k. It is clear that for zone k, if

C.1 Workload Estimation

We obtained the three data sets described above for ﬁve years from 2013 to 2017. This enabled us
to ﬁt the hypercube queue model to predict the future workload.

Call Arrival Rate Prediction. Predicting the call arrival rate is particularly challenging. Although
our operations model assumes the call arrival rates are time-homogeneous, we observe in the actual
data that the call arrival rates have a signiﬁcant seasonality pattern and yearly trend (show in
Figure 7 (b)), as well as correlation over adjacent geographical areas. Therefore, we propose a
spatio-temporal model to predict future call arrival rates.
We index the ﬁve years from 2013 to 2017 by (cid:96)

On-scene Time Estimation. As we assume the on-scene time of a response unit is independent
of its service region, we investigate the distribution of the on-scene time of each unit in the same
zone. By looking into the data, we have seen that the on-scene time of response units follows
an exponential distribution shown in Figure 5. We obtain the mean on-scene time 1/µ = 31.2
(minutes) by averaging the on-scene time of all dispatches in the past.

Travel Time Estimation. We estimated the beat-to-beat travel time T = (τij) from the 911 call
dispatch data. The estimation result is shown in Figure 6 by averaging the travel time of all 911
call dispatches that started in beat i and ended in beat j. In this ﬁgure, beats are ordered according
to their relative location in the city. Thus, the beats in the same zone are consecutively numbered.

26

Clearly, the ﬁgure reveals that local traveling within a neighborhood region usually taking a longer
time than traveling across zones. There are two major reasons accounting for this phenomenon:
ﬁrst, cross-zone calls usually have higher priority, which takes less time to response, and requires
more patrol units to assist the call (that is why sometimes they need polices from other zones);
second, response units usually resort to the highway system of the city when responding to the
non-local calls, which may help reduce the travel time.

D Literature Review on Police Workload

In our study, we consider balancing police workload as one of the design objectives. Various
deﬁnitions for police workload have been adopted in the literature. Mitchell (1972) deﬁnes police
workload as the sum of service time and travel time. Curtin et al. (2005) uses the number or
frequency of 911 calls occurring at each district as a proxy for the workload. In Bodily (1978) and
D’Amico et al. (2002), the workload is deﬁned as the fraction of working time that an agent spends
attending to calls. An equivalent measure is considered by Benveniste (1985). Response time is also
an important performance measure representing the time between the arrival of a call for service
and the arrival of a unit at the incident location. According to Bodily (1978), the reduction of the
response time results in a number of beneﬁcial eﬀects such as (a) increased likelihood of intercepting
a crime in progress; (b) deterrent eﬀect on criminals; and (c) increased conﬁdence of citizens in the
police.

E Zone Design Optimization

In this section, we develop an optimization model for zone redesign. We assume that all the beat
areas are given, so the zone districting decision is equivalent to a graph partition where we allocate
the beats to a ﬁxed number of zones. Recall that the matrix D = (dik)I×K represents the beat
K given a
allocation decisions, and w(k)(D) represents the mean police workload in zone k
districting design D.

∈

The goal is to minimize the workload variance subject to some shape constraints (e.g., contiguity

and compactness) for each zone. The zone redesign problem can be expressed as

Notice that the zone-level workload variance is chosen as the objective function in problem
(6), as APD suggested this metric for their zone redesign. However, one may also consider other
performance metrics, such as mean response time or workload variance at the beat level (we provided
expressions for these metrics in Appendix B). Our framework can be similarly adapted to solve these
problems.

E.1 Zone Workload Approximation

We consider a local approximation of the workload function, which allows the objective function
of the optimization problem (6) to be expressed explicitly. Consider a given zone with an existing
design. If we make a small change to this zone, e.g., by adding a few beats or removing a few beats,
the workload of this zone can be approximated by its ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion as

(a) D0 without shift

(b) D1 with 1 shift

(c) D2 with 2 shifts

(d) D3 with 2 shifts

Figure 17: Examples show three local decisions by making 1, 2, 2 shifts, respectively. Each
square block represents a single beat. Blocks with the same color are in the same zone. The
red boxes indicate the shifts based on the original decision. (17a) shows the original decision
D0 without any shift; (17b) shows the decision D1 with only 1 shift on the boundary; (17c,
17d) show two decisions D2, D3 with diﬀerent 2 shifts on the boundary.

We estimate the parameters in Eq (7) as follows. First, for each of the six zones in Atlanta,
we sample 1,000 designs that are created using small perturbations from the existing design. In
particular, these samples are generated by randomly changing a few beats on the boundary of
the existing zone design, see Figure 17. Obtaining a single sample involves procedures as follows:
(a) generate a random design by changing a limited number of beat assignments; (b) compute
the steady-state probabilities of six zones by solving (1); (c) obtain simulated zone workload by
computing (4). The computational bottleneck of getting one sample lies on step (b), which might
take 2 minutes or so, depending on the number of the beat shifts and the computer-processing
power. The entire generating process takes around 33 hours. Next, we estimate the parameters of
the linear function in Eq (7) using generated data samples. More speciﬁcally, we apply the least
squares method to obtain the estimated values ˆθ, where the residual is R2 = 0.987. Finally, we
i∈I ˆθikdik.
replace the exact workload function w(k)(D) with its approximation ˆw(k)(D

In Figure 18, we evaluate the eﬀectiveness of our approximation by plotting the values of the
objective function (i.e., workload variance) and corresponding approximations for 122 randomly
selected out-of-sample designs. These designs are also created based on the exiting design in

E.2 Linearizing Objective Function

With the parametric approximation (8), the objective function measuring the workload variance
becomes a quadratic function of the binary decision variables D. Using a standard technique
for quadratic binary variables, this quadratic function can be expressed as a linear form by by
introducing auxiliary variables eijkk(cid:48) with additional constraints

E.3 Contiguity and Compactness Constraints

Contiguity Constraints. We formulate the contiguity constraints using a network ﬂow approach (see
Shirabe 2009). We deﬁne a ﬂow network, where each beat is represented by a node. An arc from
node i to node j exists if the beats associated with these two nodes are geographically adjacent.
Let A represent the set of arcs.

We now deﬁne ﬂow constraints for each zone k

K to ensure contiguity. Let nmax be the
maximum number of beats allowed in a zone. If beat i belongs to zone k, i.e., dik = 1, we send
A and
one unit of ﬂow into node i. Let υijk be the amount of ﬂow from beat i to beat j if (i, j)
both beats belong to zone k. In addition, for each zone k, we specify a special “sink node.” Let
K ; otherwise, let hik be 0. The sink
hik be 1 if beat i
node receives one unit of ﬂow from every other node in the same zone. This ensures that there is a
path of positive ﬂow from any node in the zone to the sink node, implying contiguity. In sum, we
formulate the contiguity constraints as

I is selected as the sink node in zone k

Speciﬁcally, constraints (10a) represent the net outﬂow from all nodes. The two terms on the left
indicate, respectively, the total outﬂow and total inﬂow of beat i. If beat i is included in zone k
and it is not a sink, then we have dik = 1, hik = 0, and thus beat i must have an outﬂow of one

30

unit. If beat i is included in zone k and is a sink, then we have dik = 1, hik = 1, and thus beat i
has a negative outﬂow lower bounded by 1
nmax. Constraints (10b) ensure that if beat i is not in
zone k, i.e. dik = 0, there must be no ﬂow into or out of beat i with any nodes in zone k; if beat i
is in zone k (i.e. dik = 1), the ﬂow between two beats does not exceed nmax
1. Constraints (10c)
ensure that each zone must have a unique sink node. Constraints (10d) ensure that beat i must
belong to zone k if it is the sink for that zone. These constraints together ensure that each zone is
contiguous.

−

−

Compactness Constraints. We consider two ways to enforce the compactness of each zone: distance
compactness (Niemi 1990, Yong 1988) and shape compactness (Garﬁnkel and Nemhauser 1970).
For distance compactness, we require the distance between any two beats in a zone to be bounded
by some parameters. For shape compactness, we require the square of the diameter divided by the
zone’s area to be upper bounded by another parameter. These constraints can be formulated as
follows.

For each beat i

I , let lij be the
I , let Ai be its area. For each pair of beats (i, j)
square of the distance between the center of these beats. We choose two parameters ζ1, ζ2 > 0 to
control the level of distance compactness and shape constraints, respectively. Then we have
