(Dated: January 15, 2021)

Spectroscopic Amplitudes (SA) in the Interacting Boson Fermion Fermion Model (IBFFM) are
necessary for the computation of 0νββ decays but also for cross sections of heavy-ion reactions, in
particular, Double Charge Exchange reactions for the NUMEN collaboration, if one does not want
to use the closure limit. We present for the ﬁrst time: i) the formalism and operators to compute
in a general case the spectroscopic amplitudes in the scheme IBFFM from an even-even to odd-odd
nuclei, in a way suited to be used in reaction code, i.e., extracting the contribution of each orbital;
2) the odd-odd nuclei as described by the old IBFFM are obtained for the ﬁrst time with the new
implementation of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for ﬁtting the parameters, getting a more
realistic description. The one body transition densities for 116Cd → 116In and 116In → 116Sn are
part of the experimental program of the NUMEN experiment, which aims to ﬁnd constraints on
Neutrinoless double beta decay matrix elements.

The ﬁrst articles on odd-odd nuclei with algebraic
models date back to the 80s when some odd-odd
nuclei were studied by dynamical symmetry scheme,
and a supersymmetry scheme [1–3]. Unfortunately,
that approach is suitable only for a few nuclei that
correspond to dynamical supersymmetry.
It must be
emphasized that nuclear supersymmetry places very
severe constraints on the form of the boson-fermion
hamiltonian used to describe nuclei belonging to a
supermultiplet. Consequently, applications are restricted
to only a few regions of the nuclear chart. The ﬁrst
possible example of a supermultiplet involving an odd-
odd nucleus was proposed in the Pt-Au region [1, 4] and
subsequent investigations [2, 3] focused on the odd-odd
member of the quartet, 198Au in [5], 196Au in [6–8] and
194Ir in [9, 10].

In a second more general approach, which we will
follow in this paper, the Interacting Boson Model (IBM)
was extended to describe odd-odd nuclei, in which the
two fermions (one neutron and one proton) are coupled
to the even-even core described either by IBM-1 [11–13],
or by IBM-2 [14, 15]. These extensions to odd-odd nuclei
are usually referred to as the Interacting Boson-Fermion-
Fermion Model, IBFFM-1 and IBFFM-2, respectively.
In this article we use the neutron-proton version which
we will use the shorthand notation IBFFM from here on
(strictly speaking it is IBFFM-2).

The IBFFM hamiltonian is derived from semi-
microscopic arguments and subsequently diagonalized
numerically. It has been introduced by Lopac and Bianco
[11, 12], and it is essentially an IBFM-1 in the proton,
and an IBFM-1 in the neutron plus a residual interaction
as introduced by Brant and Paar [13]. The original

‡ bijker@nucleares.unam.mx

approach was extended to include the neutron-proton
degree of freedom in the description of the even-even
core nucleus in Ref. [14]. In this reference Yoshida and
Iachello and Yoshida wrote the operator expression for
single beta decay and two neutrino double beta decay,
which can be considered as a particular subset of the
general one-body transition operator presented in this
paper.

The aim of this paper is from one side to investigate
the transition from 116Cd to 116In, and 116Sn to
116In and introduce the formalism of the Spectroscopic
Amplitudes
(SA) between even-even and odd-odd
nuclei in the IBFFM that are the key ingredient for
planned publications of Double Charge Exchange (DCE)
reactions for the NUMEN collaboration and the study
0νββ decay.

The spectroscopic amplitudes operator dressed as a
charge exchange or as simple transition amplitudes is
needed for the theoretical NUMEN project Ref. [16, 17]
to be inserted into a reaction code.

For

the NUMEN experiment at

INFN-LNS in
particular there is interest for 116Cd → 116In and 116In
→ 116Sn [18].

In this article, the SA operator in the scheme of IBFFM
has been derived in a general way and then calculated
for the previous reactions and the results given in the
form of spectroscopic amplitudes, which later on can be
applied to double charge exchange, 0νββ decay processes
without closure approximation. We introduce a new
method to ﬁt the odd-odd nuclei parameters by creating
a multidimensional theoretical dataset using machine
learning libraries such as Scikit-learn. The operators
needed to compute the transitions between odd-odd and
even-even nuclei by using IBFFM depends on two factors:
the similarity between the states in the initial and ﬁnal
nucleus, which diﬀer by two nucleons, and the transferred
pair of nucleons’ correlation. We have derived the two
diﬀerent transition operators’ cases, the case where the
numbers of bosons are conserved between the even-even

 
 
 
 
 
 
and odd-odd nuclei and the one where is not conserved,
respectively.

In
The organization of this paper is the following:
Sec. I we brieﬂy review a simple theory of the one body
transitions density. In Sec. II we present the derivation
of the transition operator for the IBFFM. In Sec. III
we discuss the theory of the odd-odd nucleus in the
implemented IBFFM with Machine Learning (ML). In
Sec. IV we compute the nuclear wave functions and
spectroscopic amplitudes for the transitions 116Sn to
116In and 116Cd to 116Sn. In our last Sec. V we present
our conclusions and discuss our results, also we give the
future outlook.

initial and ﬁnal states can be presented in the proton-

where |JA(cid:105) represents the vector of the state of the initial
nucleus and |JB(cid:105) the ﬁnal nucleus, the subindex ρ(ρ(cid:48))
refers to a proton(neutron), the tilde denotes a time-
conjugated state ˜aρj = (−1)j−maj,−m. We deﬁne the
Spectroscopic Amplitudes (SA) as the the reduced matrix
element (cid:104)JB(cid:107)[a†

ρ × ˜aρ(cid:48)](λ)(cid:107)JA(cid:105).

In the isospin formalism, the nuclear states have
certain isospin, which results in a non-trivial
isospin
factor. The IBFFM can be mapped into the proton-
neutron formalism allowing to derive the one body
transition densities for the bosonic-fermionic space.
In
the followings sections, we present the derivation of the
OBTD operator for the IBFFM framework, and we study
the transitions 116Sn to the 116In, and 116In to the 116Cd
that are of interest for the NUMEN experiment.

the spin of the ﬁnal state of the odd-odd nucleus. The
case where the number of bosons Nν, Nπ between the

In the IBFFM, odd-odd nuclei are described in terms
of a system of Nπ proton bosons (sπ and dπ) and Nν
neutron bosons (sν and dν) coupled to a single proton
(jπ) and a single neutron (jν). The proton and neutron
orbitals are those of the active major shell for protons
and neutrons, respectively.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In the context of the IBFFM, the odd-odd nucleus
is described by coupling a proton and a neutron to
its core (even-even nucleus). Thus the ﬁrst step is
to construct the core nucleus.
It is described by the
IBM-2 Hamiltonian (H B) [26], which only depends on
the neutron- and proton-boson degrees of freedom, the
expression of the boson Hamiltonian H B is taken as in
Ref. [14].

To construct the odd-odd wave function of 116In, we
consider 116Cd as the core nucleus. The parameters for
the core nucleus are taken from the literature [25]. They
are shown in Table I. The spectrum of 116Cd obtained
in our calculation is presented in Fig. 1 compared to the
available experimental data [27]. We can see that the
agreement is quite good [28].

Vo(r) = Vofo(r),

with a fermi shape

Vso(r) is the spin-orbit potential:

and Vc(r) is the Coulomb potential for protons based
upon the Coulomb potential of a sphere of radius Rc:

since the average proton-neutron potential is stronger
than the average neutron-neutron (or proton-proton)
potential, thus in a nuclei with a neutron excess, the

i.e.

The second step is to construct the two odd-even
associated nuclei,
the core nucleus plus an extra
It
neutron and the core nucleus plus an extra proton.
allows us to get a reliable set of parameters that we use
to construct the odd-odd wave function.
In this case,
the odd-even nuclei are described in the context of the
IBFM-2 [22–24] where the degrees of freedom of the extra
nucleon are taken into account.
In the IBFM-2, the
Hamiltonian is given by

H = H B + H F

where H B is the boson Hamiltonian that describes the
core nucleus, the label ρ refers to the π (extra proton) or
ν (extra neutron) is added in the even-even core to form
the odd-even nucleus.

The single-particle energies (cid:15)sp are obtained by solving
the Schr¨odinger equation with the phenomenological
Woods-Saxon potential based upon the sum of a spin-
independent central potential, a spin-orbit potential, and

aso = 0.70 fm for the geometry. For the Coulomb
term the radius is a little smaller with rc = 1.20 fm.
The quasi-particle energies and occupation probabilities
were obtained solving the BCS equations with the single
particle energies calculated and reported in the Table II.

The odd-odd 116In nucleus uses the quasi-particle
energies obtained from the single-particle energies for the
odd-neutron nucleus 115Cd and the odd-proton nucleus
117In.
Both odd-even nuclei have the same even-
even core nucleus 116Cd. The core-particle coupling

For the odd-odd nucleus 116In, the tensor and Surface
Delta Interaction (SDI) play an essential role.
In this
work, the parameters are obtained by minimization of
the Mean Square Error (MSE) on the test set given
by MSE = 1
n (fn(x) − cn)2 where fn(x) are our
N
theoretical calculations and cn are the experimental
values [27]. We are interested in studying the low-lying
spectra of the odd-odd nucleus. We consider the ﬁrst
three levels of the 116In, and this procedure may be
applied to many levels as are needed. It is computed the
Mean Square Error for diﬀerent values of the parameter
of Tensor and SDI. We have seen that the MSE is very
sensitive to the parameters, as shown in Fig. 4.

FIG. 3. Energy Surface 116In.

The theoretical energy surface of the ground state 1+
of 116In is depicted in the Fig. 3. We found that the MSE
is very sensitive to the parameters, as we see in Fig. 4.

The minimization procedure consists of the creation
of an uninterpolated contour surface with a given set of
parameters over a grid of dimensions at least of dimension
11×11. After that, we generate an interpolated function
of a grid dimension 30×30, which is used to determine
the best parameters to ﬁt the experimental data.

The ﬁtting method is given by the Nelder-Mead
simplex algorithm to ﬁnd the minimum of a function of
one or more variables. The library used is the SciPy that
uses NumPy, the Machine Learning Python library used
for scientiﬁc and technical computing. We obtain the
minimum of the surface at the point with SDI -0.1500
and Tensor 0.200. with min error 6.53e-05. The result
is depicted in the Fig 5. The spectrum of the 116In is

presented in the Fig. 6. This method also can be used
for the ﬁtting parameters for the odd-even nuclei, and
even-even nuclei.

In this work, the parameters are ﬁtted to reproduce the
experimental level energies and depicted in the Figs. 6
and are reported in Table V.

In the following section, we compute the spectroscopic
amplitudes by using the previous nuclear wave functions.

A. Spectroscopic Amplitudes in IBFFM

The model space of transition is given by the model
space of the odd-odd nucleus. The model is given by ﬁve
active neutron orbitals 2d5/2, 1g7/2, 3s1/2, 2d3/2 and
1h11/2, and by four active proton orbitals 2p1/2, 2p3/2,
1f 5/2 and 1g9/2.

The nuclear states of the 116In system are in our model
restricted to be JP = 0+, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+, 6+, 7+, 8+,
and 9+, within the ﬁrst 40 excited states.

to use the calculated rather than experimental energies
because some of the experimentally known states may
not correspond. The odd-odd nuclei’s parities positives
are chosen because we are interested in the odd-odd
nucleus’s ground state. This fact aﬀects the selection
rules of the available orbitals of the transition operator
for neutrons and protons. The neutron and proton
model space chosen in the IBFFM depends on the active
protons and neutrons’ shell. The neutron’s shell chosen
for the 116In is the 50-82 shell, and for the protons,
the 28-50 shell. For the numerical calculations of the
normalization coeﬃcients of the single nucleon transfer
of neutron and proton for particle and hole coupling, we
have considered the ﬁrst 40 excited states. The numerical
results of the spectroscopic amplitudes are exhibited in
the Table VI for various cases of interest. We denote the
spectroscopic amplitudes as SA1 the transitions 116Cd
to 116In and SA2 for the transitions 116Sn to 116In. It
was found that the squared spectroscopic amplitudes for
both transitions (SA12 and SA22) tends to zero within
higher energies 6 MeV (see Fig. 7 ). That means that
the main contributions of the intermediate states are ≤ 6
MeV. Therefore we do not need an inﬁnite number of
intermediate states to compute the SA.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

It was presented for the ﬁrst

time the explicit
the IBFFM for calculating one body
operator of
transition densities in terms of active orbitals.
It
was derived the odd-even and odd-odd parameters
by using an implemented method of ﬁtting using
Machine learning libraries, which allowed computing
more realistic nuclear wave functions and presented

the spectroscopic amplitudes needed to calculate the
double charge exchange without closure. For spins of
intermediate states higher than 6 MeV, the SA tends
to zero. To summarize, the spectroscopic amplitudes
of the 116Cd, 116Sn to 116In nuclei are investigated
within the IBFFM approach. The even-even boson-core
Hamiltonian, and essential building blocks of the particle-
boson coupling Hamiltonians, i.e., single-particle energies
and odd particles’ occupation probabilities. A few
coupling constants for the boson-fermion Hamiltonians
and the residual neutron-proton interaction remain the
only free parameters of the model. They are determined
to reasonably reproduce the low-energy levels of each of
the neighboring odd-A and odd-odd nuclei. The IBM and
IBFFM wave functions obtained after diagonalization

daughter nuclei For the ﬁrst time, the parameters of
the odd-odd 116In are presented. This is attributed
to the combination of various factors adopted in the
theoretical procedure, such as the chosen boson-fermion
coupling constants, residual neutron-proton interaction,
and underlying microscopic inputs. The spectroscopic
amplitudes converge to zero after a certain energetic
value of the odd-odd nuclei’s intermediate states, as
shown in Fig 7. It has been correlations of SA between

the case of the same core and diﬀerent core.
