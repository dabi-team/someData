Abstract

One of the central goals of the physics program at the future colliders is to elucidate the origin of
electroweak symmetry breaking, including precision measurements of the Higgs sector. This includes
a detailed study of Higgs boson (H) pair production, which can reveal the H self-coupling. Since the
discovery of the Higgs boson, a large campaign of measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson has
begun and many new ideas have emerged during the completion of this program. One such idea is the use
of highly boosted and merged hadronic decays of the Higgs boson (H → bb, H → WW → qqqq) with
machine learning methods to improve the signal-to-background discrimination. In this white paper, we
champion the use of these modes to boost the sensitivity of future collider physics programs to Higgs
boson pair production, the Higgs self-coupling, and Higgs-vector boson couplings. We demonstrate the
potential improvement possible at the Future Circular Collider in hadron mode, especially with the use of
graph neural networks.

1 Introduction

The standard model (SM) of particle physics foresees that the Higgs boson (H) has three diﬀerent kinds of
interactions at tree level: (i) the Yukawa interaction with quarks and leptons, (ii) the interaction with W± and
Z vector bosons and (iii) the trilinear and quartic Higgs self-interactions. Among these, observing the SM
production of two Higgs bosons and precisely measuring the corresponding Higgs boson self-coupling 𝜆 is
a prime goal of future colliders such as the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and Future Circular Collider
in hadron mode (FCC-hh) to fully understand the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. The LHC has
already reported searches for a di-Higgs ﬁnal state focusing on the gluon fusion (ggF) production process
gg → HH. Various Higgs decay channels bbbb [1–6], bb𝜏𝜏 [7, 8], bb𝛾𝛾 [9–13], and bbVV [14, 15], as well
as combinations of channels [16–18], have been investigated by both ATLAS and CMS in a great detail. On
the other hand, di-Higgs production via vector boson fusion (VBF) processes at hadron colliders has been

INTRODUCTION

broadly studied in the theory literature [19–23], and only recently investigated experimentally [1, 24]. Current
projections [25] achieve an expected signiﬁcance of approximately 4.0 𝜎 from CMS and ATLAS combined
for the full HL-LHC data set. Measurements of Higgs boson pair production face the diﬃculty of the small
expected event yields even for the mode with the largest branching fraction (bbbb) as well as the presence of
similar reconstructed QCD multĳet events, which occur far more often. However, these projections do not
include dedicated analyses of highly boosted hadronic ﬁnal states, which may be especially sensitive to the
SM and anomalous Higgs couplings [26].

If the Higgs boson is highly Lorentz boosted, its hadronic decay products can be reconstructed as one single
jet and the jet can be tagged using jet substructure techniques [27–30]. Moreover, several machine learning
(ML) methods have also been demonstrated to be extremely eﬃcient in jet tagging and jet reconstruction [31].
In the present work, we adopt ML algorithms to analyze boosted di-Higgs production in the four-bottom-quark
𝑠 = 100 TeV and to
ﬁnal state at the FCC-hh, which is expected to produce hadron-hadron collisions at
deliver an ultimate integrated luminosity of 30 ab−1. We compare our ML-based event selection to a reference
cut-based selection [32] to demonstrate potential gains in sensitivity. The rest of the white paper is organized
as follows. In Section 1.1 and 1.2, we illustrate the potential of boosted Higgs channels based on the expected
yields and introduce the ML methods. In Section 2, we describe the reference cut-based analysis and in
Section 3, we explain our ML-based analysis. Finally, we provide a summary and outlook in Section 4.

√

1.1 Boosted Higgs

The hadronic ﬁnal states of the Higgs boson are attractive because of their large branching fractions relative
to other channels. While the bb𝛾𝛾 “golden channel” has a 0.26% branching fraction, the bbbb and bbWW
channels have a combined 58.8% branching fraction, which often produce a fully hadronic ﬁnal state. At low
transverse momentum (𝑝T), these ﬁnal states are diﬃcult to disentangle from the background, but at high
𝑝T, the decay products merge into a single jet, which new ML methods can identify with exceptionally high
accuracy. Even with a requirement on the 𝑝T of the Higgs boson, the hadronic ﬁnal states are still appealing
in terms of signal acceptance. The eﬃciency of the 𝑝T > 400 GeV requirement on both Higgs bosons is about
4% at the LHC. Thus, the boosted bbbb (bbWW) channel with 𝑝T > 400 GeV has 5.2 times (4.3 times) more
signal events than the “golden” bb𝛾𝛾 channel at the LHC. Given the higher center-of-mass energy of the
FCC-hh, the boosted fraction would increase.

Based on our preliminary investigations and existing LHC Run 2 results, these boosted channels are
competitive with the bb𝛾𝛾 channel, which corresponds to an expected signiﬁcance of 2.7 standard deviations
(𝜎) with the full ATLAS and CMS HL-LHC data set. As such, exploring these additional ﬁnal states with
new methods will be crucial to achieving the best possible sensitivity to the Higgs self-coupling.

1.2 Machine Learning for Di-Higgs Searches

Emerging ML techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks
(GNNs) [33–35], have enabled better identiﬁcation of these boosted Higgs boson jets while reducing the
backgrounds [36–41]. CNNs treat the jet input data as either a list of particle properties or as an image. In the
image representation case, CNNs leverage the symmetries of an image, namely translation invariance, in their
structure. Deeper CNNs are able to learn more abstract features of the input image in order to classify them
correctly. GNNs are also well-suited to these tasks because of their structure, and have enjoyed widespread
success in particle physics [42–44]. GNNs treat the jet as an unordered graph of interconnected constituents
(nodes) and learn relationships between pairs of these connected nodes. These relationships then update

2 REFERENCE CUT-BASED EVENT SELECTION

the features of the nodes in a message-passing [45] or edge convolution [35] step. Afterward, the collective
updated information of the graph nodes can be used to infer properties of the graph, such as whether it
constitutes a Higgs boson jet. In this way, GNNs learn pairwise relationships among particles and use this
information to predict properties of the jet.

Signiﬁcantly, it has been shown that these ML methods can identify several classes of boosted jets better
than previous methods. For instance these methods have been used to search for highly boosted H(bb) [46]
and VH(cc) [47] in CMS. Most recently, they have also been shown to enable the best sensitivity to the SM
HH production cross section and to the quartic VVHH coupling in CMS using the LHC Run 2 data set [1]. In
this work, we study the impact of the use of these ML algorithms in future colliders like the FCC-hh.

2 Reference Cut-based Event Selection

For the cut-based reference selection, we follow Refs. [32, 48]. In particular, we study the conﬁguration in
which the Higgs boson pair recoils against one or more jets. We use the Delphes-based [49] signal and
background samples from Ref. [50]. The signal sample of HH+jet is generated taking into account the
full top quark mass dependence at leading order (LO) with the jet 𝑝T greater than 200 GeV. Higher-order
QCD corrections are accounted for with a 𝐾-factor 𝐾 = 1.95 applied to the signal samples [48], leading to
𝜎HH 𝑗 = 38 fb for jet 𝑝T > 200 GeV and 𝜅𝜆 = 1. The main background includes at least four b-jets, where the
two bb pairs come from QCD multĳet production, mainly from gluon splitting g → bb. The LO background
cross section for jet 𝑝T > 200 GeV is given by 𝜎bbbb 𝑗 (QCD) = 443.1 pb.

Jets are reconstructed with the anti-𝑘T [51, 52] algorithm with a radius parameter 𝑅 = 0.8 (AK8) and
𝑅 = 0.4 (AK4). The AK8 jets are formed from calorimeter energy clusters whereas the AK4 jets are formed
from track elements.

We require two AK8 jets with 𝑝T > 300 GeV and |𝜂| < 2.5. The AK8 jets are considered double b-tagged
if they contain two b-tagged AK4 subjets. This AK4 b-tagging emulation corresponds to a conservative signal
eﬃciency of 70%. The two highest 𝑝T double b-tagged AK8 jets constitute the Higgs boson candidates. We
further require the AK8 dĳet system to be suﬃciently boosted, 𝑝 𝑗 𝑗
T > 250 GeV, and the leading jet to have a
𝑝T > 400 GeV. The jet 𝑝T and soft-drop mass 𝑚SD [53] distributions are shown in Figure 1, along with the
N-subjettiness ratio 𝜏21 = 𝜏2/𝜏1 [54]. The two Higgs boson candidate AK8 jets are tagged by selecting jets
with 𝜏21 < 0.35 and 100 < 𝑚SD < 130 GeV.

After the selections, the expected signal (𝑆) and background (𝐵) yields for 30 ab−1 are 12 700 and
𝐵 = 1.8. The signal and background eﬃciencies

49 900 000 events, yielding an approximate signiﬁcance 𝑆/
of the cut-based selection are 1.7% and 0.53%, respectively.

√

3 Graph Neural Network Event Selection

We build a boosted HH → bbbb event classiﬁer using a GNN based on the features of all the AK4 and AK8
jet constituents (tracks and calorimeter clusters, respectively) in the event, as well as additional jet features.
We stress that this approach, an event-level classiﬁer using the information provided in the FCC-hh samples,
is conservative as we expect the largest gains in signal-to-background discrimination to arise from including
lower-level detector information, including tracking and vertexing information. Nonetheless, we can still
compare this approach with a cut-based selection with access to similar information.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

5

To deﬁne the input graph data structure or point cloud, each of the jet constituents is treated as a node
with its associated pseudorapidity (𝜂) and azimuthal angle (𝜙) as coordinates. The event can then be thought
of as a two-dimensional point cloud. A graph is then formed using the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm in
the 𝜂-𝜙 plane. Each node has four features, namely the four components of the energy-momentum Lorentz
vector. We augment this node representation with three additional variables related to the jet as a whole. In
particular, we include the two- and one-subjettiness (𝜏2 and 𝜏1) as well as b-tagging probability. Hence this
construction associates a feature vector of size 7 to each node.

For the GNN architecture operation, we use the dynamic edge convolution. The original idea was
proposed for shape classiﬁcation [35], and was also used for jet classiﬁcation [37]. The message-passing
(MP) operation, referred to as EdgeConv, from layer ℓ to layer ℓ + 1 consists of the following operations

𝑥ℓ
𝑖 are the features of node 𝑖 at layer ℓ, and 𝑒ℓ

𝑖 are the features of edge 𝑖 at layer ℓ.

The implemented model has four such MP layers. The output dimensions of the 𝑥 coordinate after each
layers are 3, 5, 4, and 2, respectively, whereas the dimensions of the variable 𝑒 are chosen to be 4, 5, 6,
and 8, respectively. The energy outputs of each layers are concatenated and passed though a MLP block to
predict the output probability of the given event. The model is trained using a binary crossentropy loss for the
classiﬁcation task. The signal events correspond to simulated HH(bbbb) events, while background events are
from simulated QCD multĳet production with four bottom quarks. The optimizer used is Adam [55] with a
ﬁxed learning rate of 10−3. For training purposes we have used 50 k events for training data and 10 k events
for validation data with batch size of ﬁve.

The output of the trained network is evaluated on an independent test sample of signal and background
and the logarithm of the signal-like event probability is shown in Figure 2. The distribution demonstrates
that a trained network can separate the signal from background. The level of discrimination is quantiﬁed by
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shown in Figure 3. This preliminary training can identify
signal with 40% eﬃciency at the background eﬃciency level of 9%. Compared to the cut-based selection,
the event-level GNN can identify HH(bbbb) signal events with an eﬃciency of about 6.1% for the same
background eﬃciency of 0.53%, corresponding to a factor of 3 improvement.

4 Summary and Outlook

√

In summary, we have investigated the feasibility of observing the production of a pair of boosted Higgs bosons
in hadronic ﬁnal states at the Future Circular Collider in hadron mode (FCC-hh) and improving the sensitivity
with machine learning (ML) techniques. The data sets simulated with Delphes corresponds to a center-of-mass
𝑠 = 100 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 30 ab−1 We focused on the four-bottom-quark ﬁnal
energy
state, in which the each bb pair is reconstructed as a large-radius jet. We have studied the sensitivity using a
traditional cut-based analysis as well as a selection based on an event classiﬁer built using a graph neural
network (GNN). modern GNN techniques. For the cut-based analysis, we leveraged the jet kinematics,
substructure variables, and b-tagging for the two leading jets in the event. For the GNN, we used lower level
information, such as the jet constituents’ four-momenta, as well as high-level jet substructure and b-tagging

variables. We established that a better sensitivity by a factor of 3 is achievable using the GNN as shown in
Fig. 3.

Higgs boson pair production is a crucial process to characterize and measure precisely at future colliders.
In order to do so with the best precision possible, it is important to exploit all possible production and decay
modes. This includes the high-𝑝T hadronic ﬁnal states, such as bbbb, W(qq)W(qq)bb, W(qq)W(ℓ𝜈)bb,
and bb𝛾𝛾, whose sensitivity can be improved with ML methods. Beyond H jet classiﬁcation, particle
reconstruction [56–58], and jet reconstruction [59], and jet mass regression [60] algorithms can also be
improved with ML.

Fully quantifying the impact of ML for these ﬁnal states on the ultimate sensitivity achievable for the HH
cross section, H self-coupling, trilinear VVH coupling, and quartic VVHH coupling are important goals of
future work. Another important future deliverable is to consider how these ML methods may impact optimal
detector design. In this context, explainable AI methods [61] can be developed to understand the physics
learned by the networks, and fully exploit this in future detector design. Future work can also explore the
impact of using symmetry-equivariant networks [62, 63] for Higgs boson property measurements at future
colliders.
