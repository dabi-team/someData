Abstract—In this work, we investigate a data-driven
approach for obtaining a reduced equivalent load model
of distribution systems for electromechanical transient sta-
bility analysis. The proposed reduced equivalent is a neuro-
physical model comprising of a traditional ZIP load model
augmented with a neural network. This neuro-physical
model is trained through differentiable programming. We
discuss the formulation, modeling details, and training of
the proposed model set up as a differential parametric
program. The performance and accuracy of this neuro-
physical ZIP load model is presented on a medium-scale
350-bus transmission-distribution network.

I. INTRODUCTION

The electrical power grid is going through a trans-
formation of technologies and processes spurred by the
deep proliferation of renewable energy sources, smarter
control
through increasing use of power electronic
sources, and availability of high-ﬁdelity measurement
sources such as PMUs. Most of the developments in the
electrical grid are emanating from the medium to low-
voltage distribution grid. With progressively growing
deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs), such
as photovoltaics (PV), storage devices, electric vehicles,
and microgrids, the characteristics of distribution sys-
tems are becoming more complex, both statically and
dynamically [1].

A considerable amount of distributed generation is
variable and non-dispatchable, primarily comprising of
roof-top solar PV panels. The inception of generating
sources at the distribution level is not only reducing the
net load consumed, but also introducing new patterns of
load ﬂow, and voltage abnormalities, including reversed
power ﬂow, which is not well-suited to existing system
designs [2]. Most DERs are interfaced with the grid
through power electronic inverters adding complexity of
operation due to fast nature of power electronics. The
introduction of power electronics is pushing the time-
scales of power system transient studies from seconds
(rotating generators) to microseconds (power electronic
switches).

Hitherto, the distribution grid has been considered as a
“passive“ network for the transmission network analysis,

devoid or having minimal generation resources. With
the introduction and increasing penetration of DERs, the
distribution grids are becoming much more complex and
exhibiting dynamics never seen before. Understanding
and faithfully reproducing an accurate response of the
distribution system is a big challenge due to the diversity
in the distribution system.

a) Contributions: We propose a novel neuro-
physical reduced equivalent model of distribution sys-
tems for electromechanical stability analysis. As op-
posed to model reduction methods that either lean on
physics-based models only or data-driven models, our
approach combines these two approaches to realize both
their beneﬁts. In this work, the proposed neuro-physical
dynamic equivalent comprises of a traditional physics-
based ZIP load model augmented with a neural network.
This neuro-physical model is set up as a constrained
least squares problem and solved through the use of a
novel differentiable parametric programming approach
that optimizes the physics parameters and the neural
network weights together. The neuro-physical model can
be used as a surrogate or a reduced-order equivalent of
the external area or downstream distribution system to
accelerate transient stability simulations of large-scale
transmission-distribution grids.

II. RELATED WORK

a) Classical

load modeling: Extensive work on
load modeling has been carried out by power system
researchers [3]–[6] to guide the development of load
models. In the component-based approach [4], an equiv-
alent load model is derived through an aggregation of
individual load mix (residential, commercial, and in-
dustrial) and load class composition (resistance heating,
lighting, room air conditioner, water heating, etc.). The
measurement-based approach is based on ﬁtting a model
on response characteristics of the distribution system
such as the active and reactive power, voltages and three-
phase currents. Examples include estimation algorithms
based on statistical [7], [8] and heuristic techniques [9]–
[11]. A typical approach to model loads is through a

 
 
 
 
 
 
ZIP load model with its composition (Z, I, P param-
eters) infered through load composition. Another line
of research work is dynamic equivalencing. This work
has been primarily targeted towards ﬁnding a reduced
equivalent model of external area. There are various
techniques used including calculating observable and
controllable Grammians, Hankel singular values [12],
linearized models [13]–[15], and neural networks [16],
[17].

b) Differentiable optimization: Recently, there has
been an emergence on the intersection of constrained
optimization and deep learning we could label as
learning to optimize methods. Supported problem types
range from quadratic programs [18], stochastic opti-
mization [19], submodular optimization [20], optimal
control problems [21], or even combinatorial optimiza-
tion problems [22], to name just a few. Reference [23]
shows enforcement of hard constraints in learning the
solution of constrained nonlinear optimization problems
via deep neural networks. More recently, the authors
in [24] introduced implicit layers that are modeled by
differentiable constrained optimization solvers and can
be used as a plug and play layers in popular deep
learning frameworks such as Pytorch or Tensorﬂow.
The above methods inspired the presented method for
load modeling by casting the constrained nonlinear least
squares problem as a differentiable parametric program.
c) Constrained neural architectures: There are nu-
merous challenges associated with solving constrained
deep learning problems, including guarantees on con-
vergence to stationary points and global minima, smart
learning rates, min-max optimization, non-convex regu-
larizers, or constraint satisfaction guarantees [25]. Ref-
erence [26] showed how handling of constraints by
modifying the Conditional Gradients (CG) algorithm.
Speciﬁc neural architectures can be designed to impose a
certain class of hard constraints, such as linear operator
constraints [27]. Authors in [28] demonstrated use of
a log-barrier method for imposing inequality constraints
leading to improved accuracy, constraint satisfaction, and
training stability. Penalty methods based on regulariza-
tion terms in the loss function have become a popular
choice for imposing inequality constraints on the outputs
of deep neural network models [29], [30]. As pointed
out by [31], in practice, the existing methods for in-
corporating hard constraints rarely outperform their soft
constraint counterparts despite their weak performance
guarantees.

III. TRANSIENT STABILITY ANALYSIS

Power systems undergo disturbances of various types,
including balanced and unbalanced short circuits, outage
of generators, transmission lines and other equipment,
breaker tripping, etc. [32]. System planning engineers

2

routinely conduct dynamic security assessment (DSA)
studies to analyze the impact of different events, such
as a new generator interconnection request or a new
equipment installation (e.g. SVCs), or the loss of critical
lines or loads. Such studies require the simulation of a
lot of what-if scenarios that analyze the system impact
of disturbances relative to the base case and different
contingency conditions.

In transient stability analysis,

the electrical power
system is expressed as a set of nonlinear DAEs, where
the differential equations model, f ∈ Rm,dynamics of
the rotating machines (e.g., generators and motors) and
the algebraic equations, g ∈ Rn, represent the nodal
balance at the network buses.

p(x−) ≤ x ≤ p(x+)

(1)

Here, x represents the dynamic or state variable asso-
ciated with the dynamics of the rotating machines, and
y represents the algebraic variables primarily comprising
of the network voltages. A typical form of the algebraic
equations g is the current-balance form given by (2).

IGen − IN et − ILoad = 0

(2)

where, IGen is the current injection from the generators,
IN et is the current transported over the network, ILoad
is the load consumption. Accurate load modeling plays
a very important role in power system transient stability
analysis. As transient stability studies are restricted to the
high-voltage transmission system (typically 69 kV and
up), the aggregated response of the underlying distribu-
tion system is modeled through reduced order equivalent
load models incident at the distribution substation buses.
Faithfully reproducing an accurate response of the dis-
tribution system is a big challenge due to the diversity
of the loads on the distribution system.

IV. NEURO-PHYSICAL DYNAMIC LOAD MODEL
The goal of the work is to develop an a reduced equiv-
alent of the distribution network for stability analysis.
Figure 1 illustrates the transmission (T) and distribu-
tion (D) networks connected at a single boundary bus.
We assume presence of measurement devices (such as
PMUs) to measure the voltages ¯V (t) = V (t)∠θV (t)
and the currents ¯I(t) = I(t)∠θI (t) at the boundary
bus. Using these measurements, an equivalent reduced
load model of the external area needs to be discerned
given the voltage measurements at the boundary. We
assume a following functional form for the power drawn
S = f ( ¯V ), where S is the complex power drawn that
consists of two components - real power P and reactive
power Q.

In our work, the proposed neuro-physical load com-
prises of two components - a physics-based model and

B. Neuro-physical ZIP model

While the physics-based ZIP load model is simplistic,
it lacks the ﬁdelity of capturing the complex dynamics
primarily because of its restriction to second-order poly-
nomial form. Employing different load models, such as
WECC composite load model, is a possibility but it is an
extremely complex model and estimating its parameters
is a big challenge. In this work, we instead divert to
improving the accuracy of a ZIP model using deep
neural networks. Thus, the neuro-physical ZIP model
combines the beneﬁts of simplicity and some notion
of interpretability from the physics-based model along
with the expressiveness of the neural network to discover
complex dynamics.

The neuro-physical ZIP model expresses the real P (t)
and reactive Q(t) powers as a convex combination of the
physics-based and neural models as follows:

Pﬁt(t, k) = a ˆP (t, k) + (1 − a) ˜P (t, k)
Qﬁt(t, k) = b ˆQ(t, k) + (1 − b) ˜Q(t, k)

(6a)

(6b)

Here, ˆP and ˆQ is the output
from the physics-
based model (3a), (3b) and ˜P and ˜Q is the output
from the neural network model, i.e., { ˜P (t), ˜Q(t)} =
πΘ(V (t), θV (t)), where πΘ is the neural network model
with weights Θ. The overall model is given as a convex
combination (6) of the polynomial and neural model
where a, b are scalars that determine the proportion of the
physics-based and neural-network outputs. Depending on
their values, the proposed neuro-physical ZIP model can
range from a pure physics-based model (a = 1, b = 1)
to an only neural network model (a = 0, b = 0).

To train the model (6) we need to solve the following

constrained least squares problem:

a neural network model. We ﬁrst discuss the ZIP load
model which is our choice of physics-based load model
used in this paper. Though a ZIP load model is overtly
simplistic and may not be an accurate representation of
the downstream distribution system, it was solely chosen
for implementation ease. Other types of load models,
such as motor load models, or composite load models
can be also incorporated in the formulation.

A. Physics-based model

For the physics based model, we will restrict our
discussion to the commonly used ZIP load model. This
model expresses the real and reactive power drawn ˆP and
ˆQ as a 2nd order polynomial function of the voltages.

The initial load power ˆP (t0), ˆQ(t0) and the initial volt-

this is done through solving the following constrained
least-squares problem for αp, αi, αz and βp, βi, βz.

measurements at the boundary bus.

V. DIFFERENTIABLE PARAMETRIC OPTIMIZATION

In this work, we leverage differentiable parametric
optimization (DPO) to learn the solution of the original

constrained optimization problem. A generic formulation
of the DPO is given as follows:

(8b)

(8c)

(8d)

(8e)

Where Ξ represents the sampled dataset, and ξi repre-
sents i-th batch of the sampled problem data. The vector
xi represents optimized variables that minimize the loss
function while satisfying set of equality (8c) and inequal-
ity (8b) constraints. The mapping (8d) parametrized by
Θ represents the solution of the underlying constrained
optimization problem. In this work, we use the Neuro-
mancer library [33] for solving the above load modeling
given as constrained nonlinear least squares problem (7).
Neuromancer is an open-source Python library built
on Pytorch [34] infrastructure that allows to formulate
and solve generic DPO problems (8) by sampling and
gradient optimization using AdamW solver [35].

a) Constraints penalties: A simple approach to
penalize the constraints violations is by augmenting the
loss function Lobj (8a) with the penalty functions:

Lcon = Qg||ReLU(g(xi, ξi))||l + Qh||h(xi, ξi)||l

(9)

Where l denotes the norm type and Qg, Qh being
the corresponding weight factors. The overall loss then
becomes L = Lobj + Lcon.

b) Neuro-physical ZIP model cast as a DPO prob-
lem: To solve the problem (7), we cast it in the form (8).
Here, the data samples are represented by the power
measurements ξk = {P ∗(t, k), Q∗(t, k)},
the least
square loss (7b) is captured by (8a), the physics-based
model given by (3), (7c), (7d), (7e), (7f) is compactly
represented by a set of equality (8c) and inequality (8b)
constraints penalized during training via (9), While the
parametric solution map to be trained (8d) represents the
neural model of the problem (7).

VI. CASE STUDY

A. Power system network setup

The neuro-physical ZIP load model was tested on a
synthetic transmission-distribution network made up of
200-bus synthetic network from the ACTIVSg test case
repository [36]–[38] connected to a 141-bus distribution
network from the MATPOWER [39] library. The two
networks are connected at a single bus through an
added interface line as shown in Fig. 2. The 200-bus
transmission node has dynamic models of synchronous
generators, exciters, and turbine-governors as given in

Fig. 2. Two-area system comprising of a 200-bus transmission network
connected to a 141-bus distribution bus at a single boundary node (bus)

the ACTIVSg test case repository. To incorporate dy-
namic models in the 141-bus distribution network, each
load bus was made up of a combination of a ZIP load
model and induction machine motor model as shown in
Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. Each distribution network node comprises a ZIP load model
and three-phase induction motor model

B. Training and test data

Dynamic simulations of

the combined 200-bus
transmission+141-bus distribution network were run for
three-phase fault on the 141-bus system at different loca-
tions. Three scenarios were considered and the following
data was collected for training and testing the proposed
model.

• Three-phase faults at different locations on the dis-
tribution grid. Data for 20 trajectories was collected.
• Three-phase faults on the transmission side at dif-
ferent locations with the distribution loads modeled
as constant impedance. Data for 50 trajectories was
collected.

• Three-phase faults on the transmission side at dif-
ferent locations with the distribution loads modeled
as shown in ﬁg. 3. Data for 50 trajectories was
collected.

Each fault simulation was for 10 second total with
a fault applied for six cycles (or 0.1 seconds). The
voltages at the transmission boundary bus and the current

ﬂowing to the distribution network were recorded for
each trajectory.

C. Solution setup

The data for each scenario mentioned above was split
into training and test data sets. 60% of the data, 20% for
validation, and 20% for testing. We used the open-source
library Neuromancer [33] for solving the problem cast as
differential parametric optimization (DPO) problem (8).
AdamW [35] with learning rate of 0.01 was used for the
optimizer. The relative weights for equality and bounds
constraints penalties were set to Qg = 1.0, Qh = 1.0.
The neural network model we use has four layers with 20
nodes per layer. Overall, models converge to a solution
in about 8 mins on CPU.

D. Results and discussion

1) Scenario 1: Three-phase faults at different loca-
tions on the distribution grid: Figures 4 and 5 shows the
comparison of real and reactive power from the ZIP and
trained Neuro-ZIP model against the reference trajecto-
ries. As seen in the ﬁgure, the neuro-ZIP model shows
a close match with the reference trajectory, particularly
for the real power (P). All the trajectories for scenario
1 resulted in reaching a steady-state after 4 seconds and
hence we only used data for the ﬁrst four seconds of the
dynamics simulations.

2) Scenario 2: Three-phase faults on the transmission
side at different locations with the distribution loads
modeled as constant impedance load models:
In this
scenario, the faults were applied on the transmission
side. The loads at the distribution nodes were modeled
as constant impedances. Figures 6 and 7 compare the
performance of the neuro-ZIP model. For this scenario,
the proposed model was able to track the reference
trajectory very accurately compared to the traditional ZIP
model only.

3) Scenario 3: Three-phase faults on the transmission
side at different locations with the distribution loads
modeled as shown in ﬁg. 3: This scenario is the same
as scenario 2 with the exception that the loads on the
distribution side are a combination of loads as shown
in ﬁg. 3. Figure 8 and 9 has a comparison of the output
from the ZIP and the trained neuro-ZIP model against the
reference trajectory. The trained model is able to track
the slow moving dynamics to a good degree, but it has
some discrepancies in tracking the transient part.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we presented a neuro-physical load mod-
eling approach for determining a dynamic load model
of distribution grids for transient stability analysis. We
formulate this problem as a differentiable constrained
nonlinear least-squares problem by learning a convex
