Learning Combined Set Covering and Traveling Salesman Problem 

Abstract 

The Traveling Salesman Problem is one of the most intensively studied combinatorial optimization 

problems due both to its range of real-world applications and its computational complexity. When 

combined  with  the  Set  Covering  Problem,  it  raises  even  more  issues  related  to  tractability  and 

scalability. We study a combined Set Covering and Traveling Salesman problem and provide a 

mixed integer programming formulation to solve the problem. Motivated by applications where 

the optimal policy needs to be updated on a regular basis and repetitively solving this via MIP can 

be computationally expensive, we propose a machine learning approach to effectively deal with 

this problem by providing an opportunity to learn from historical optimal solutions that are derived 

from the MIP formulation. We also present a case study using the World Health Organization’s 

vaccine distribution chain, and provide numerical results with data derived from four countries in 

sub-Saharan Africa.

1. Introduction and literature review 

The  Traveling  Salesman  Problem  (TSP)  is  among  the  most  intensively  studied  combinatorial 

optimization problems by both the operations research and the machine learning communities. It 

has  been  widely  applied  in  areas  such  as  planning,  manufacturing,  genetics,  neuroscience, 

telecommunication, healthcare, supply chains and logistics [1]. The objective in TSP is to find the 

shortest route that visits each of a given set of locations and returns to the origin. We consider a 

TSP  in  combination  with  the  Set  Covering  Problem  (SCP),  where  the  goal  of  the  SCP  in  this 

context is to select an optimal subset of locations for facilities, so as to “cover” all locations in the 

original set of locations [2], [3]. SCP is also a well-studied problem in the operations research 

community and has been broadly applied in areas such as facility planning, healthcare, and supply 

chains [4]. 

TSP by itself is a hard problem. Exact algorithms such as branch-and-bound, cutting-plane 

and branch-and-cut methods often slow down when the number of nodes exceeds a few hundred 

[1]. Large-scale TSP is thus mainly solved by approximation algorithms and heuristics to find high 

quality solutions that are within 2–3% (say) of the optimum [5]–[8]. Some of the widely used TSP 

approximation algorithms and heuristics include Christofides’ algorithm [9], 2-opt moves [10], 3-

opt moves [11], [12], the Lin–Kernighan (LK) method [13], [14], large-step Markov chains [15], 

[16], stem-and-cycle method [17], [18], and ant colony optimization [19]. Interested readers can 

refer to [1], [5], [20], [21] for more details about TSP approximation algorithms and heuristics.  

When combined with SCP, TSP takes on even more complexity. With a given set of facility 

locations, TSP only considers transportation costs and its binary decision variables only determine 

whether or not location 𝑖 is followed by location 𝑗. When combined with SCP, the problem first 

3 

 
needs to identify locations at which to open facilities, and then come up with a route that visits 

each such location before returning to the origin. In doing this it needs to consider an overall cost 

that is the sum of facility costs, customer assignment costs, and transportation costs. The binary 

decision  variables  determine  whether  or  not  a  facility  is  open  at  location 𝑖 is  open,  whether  a 

location 𝑗 is  assigned  to  an  open  facility  at  location 𝑖,  and  whether  location 𝑘 is  followed  by 

location 𝑙 in the TSP route. Clearly, the combined SCP and TSP problem raises more issues related 

to tractability and scalability than either SCP or TSP separately. 

In Section 2 we formulate the combined Set Covering and Traveling Salesman Problem as 

a mixed integer program (MIP). Solving this MIP can theoretically provide us with the optimal 

solution, but the run time explodes exponentially as the problem size increases. In addition, every 

time we re-solve the MIP model using new inputs and parameters, it typically starts from scratch 

and  there  is  often  no  obvious  method  to  incorporate  information  from  historical  solutions. 

Therefore,  in  any  application  where  the  above  combinatorial  problem  needs  to  be  solved 

repeatedly  over  time  with  different  input  values,  an  approach  that  relies  on  MIP  can  become 

computationally  expensive.  For  example,  in  an  application  that  we  describe  in  Section  4,  the 

problem needs to be solved and the solution needs to be updated every month over hundreds of 

locations.  

If a training dataset can be derived from a set of historically solved problems, machine 

learning (ML) could be a natural candidate to effectively deal with this repeated combinatorial 

situation. The proposed work aims at providing a tractable and scalable learning-based approach 

to solve the combined SCP and TSP problems. We first formulate this problem as a mixed integer 

programming model and discuss relevant issues in Section 2. We then propose a learning-based 

mechanism  to  efficiently  deal  with  this  problem  in  Section  3.  In  Section  4,  we  provide  an 

4 

 
illustration of our approach with an application to mobile clinics and vaccination outreach that 

arises  in  the  context  of  the  World  Health  Organization’s  (WHO)  Expanded  Programme  on 

Immunization (EPI) , and present numerical results using data derived from the WHO and four 

countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, Section 5 discusses some related issues and Section 6 

summarizes this paper.  

Several  recent  studies  have  been  conducted  by  both  the  operations  research  and  the 

machine  learning  communities  to  try  and  incorporate  machine  learning  into  combinatorial 

optimization problems. Many of these studies aim at end-to-end learning methods that train the 

ML  model  from  discrete  optimization  problems  and  directly  output  solutions  from  the  input 

instance.  For  instance,  Vinyals  et  al.  introduced  the  pointer  network  [22]  as  a  recurrent  neural 

network (RNN) that sequentially takes all the nodes in the graph as input and outputs the TSP route 

using a mechanism that is similar to the graph attention mechanism [23] that is normally used to 

focus only on a subset of the input. Using a similar model, Bello et al. trained a reinforcement 

learning model and defined its reward signals as tour lengths [24]. Instead of using RNN to process 

the input, Kool and Welling utilized graph neural networks (GNN) [25] after adding attention to 

establish a similar model [26]. GNN can also be derived to learn the node selection policy [27]. 

Using a different approach, Nowak et al. approximated a double stochastic matrix [28] and Emami 

and  Ranka  used  Sinkhorn  Policy  Gradient  [29]  in  the  GNN  output  in  order  to  characterize  the 

permutation. Kaempfer and Wolf developed a Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem solver using 

Permutation Invariant Pooling Networks [30]. Bronstein et al. overviewed geometric deep learning 

problems with several applications, solutions, difficulties, and future directions [31]. 

Machine  learning  can  also  be  used  to  retrieve  meaningful  properties  of  optimization 

problems, or even alongside the optimization as part of the optimization algorithm. This class of 

5 

 
approaches include learning to branch [32]–[37], learning to cut [38], [39], learning when to use 

Dantzig-Wolf decomposition [40], learning how to disaggregate the problem [41], learning where 

to  linearize  a  mixed  integer  quadratic  problem  [42],  learning  tactical  solutions  under  imperfect 

information [43], and learning as a modeling tool [44]. These studies, including those end-to-end 

learning approaches, often face feasibility, modeling, scaling, and data generation challenges, and 

are still mostly in the exploratory stages [45]. 

On  the  other  hand,  deep  learning,  as  a  sub-field  of  machine  learning,  has  advanced 

dramatically  with  the  growth  of  large  datasets  and  computational  power,  and  has  led  to 

breakthroughs on a variety of tasks including speech recognition, machine translation, objective 

detection, and computer vision [46]. Deep learning often outperforms other learning algorithms 

when exploring high dimensional spaces and large datasets [47], [48]. Many researchers have been 

using deep learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In fact, many of the approaches 

mentioned above belong to this category; these include Pointer Networks [22], [24], GNN [23], 

[25]–[28],  Sinkhorn  Policy  Gradient  [29],  Permutation  Invariant  Pooling  Networks  [30], 

Geometric learning [31], and others [38]–[40], [43]. This paper aims at providing one of the early 

approaches  for  an  end-to-end  learning  algorithm  for  a  particular  combinatorial  optimization 

problem via deep learning. 

2. MIP formulation 

The  Combined  Set  Covering  and  Traveling  Salesmen  Problem  can  be  formulated  using  the 

following mathematical programming model:  

Parameters

𝑛:	Total number of targeted customer locations  

𝑖:	Index of locations; 1	≤	i	≤	n for targeted customer locations;	i	=	0, n+1	for the origin 

𝑓/:	Fixed cost of running a facility at location i	 

𝑐/1:	Variable cost of assigning a location j to a facility at location i;  𝑐// = 0 

𝑝:	Average transportation cost per unit of distance  

𝑑/1:	Distance	between location	𝑖	and location	𝑗	4with	𝑑// = 0	and 𝑑/1	=	𝑑1/	5 

𝐷:	Maximal coverage distance (MCD) 

𝑎/1∈{0,1}: 1 if location j is within	a distance D from location i 

Variables 

𝑋/1 	 ∈ {0,1}: 1 if location j is assigned to facility at location i, 0 otherwise; 

𝑌/ ∈ {0,1}:	1 if there is a facility at location 𝑖, 0 otherwise 

𝑍/1 ∈ {0,1}:	1 if location i is followed by location j on the trip route  

𝑈/:	Cumulative number of stops visited during a trip when arriving at facility location i

Note that the objective function (1) minimizes the sum of the facility location, assignment, 

and transportation costs. Constraint set (2) ensures that a location can only be assigned to a facility 

that  is  within  the  maximal  coverage  distance  (MCD),  in  which  case 𝑎/1 = 1,  and  0  otherwise. 

Constraint set (3) ensures that the assignment is to an existing facility. Constraint set (4) ensures 

that each location is assigned to exactly one facility. These three sets of constraints define a typical 

Set Covering Problem.  

The next few sets of constraints relate to the Traveling Salesman Problem. Note that node 

0 denotes the beginning node of a trip and node (𝑛+1) is the final node of a trip; both represent the 

origin. Constraint sets (5) and (6) imply that the trip departs from the origin (0) exactly once, while 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Constraint  sets  (7)  and  (8)  imply  that  the  trip  enters  back  into  the  origin  (𝑛+1)  exactly  once. 

Constraint  set  (9)  ensures  that  the  flow  that  enters  and  departs  any  location  𝑖  is  balanced. 

Constraints (5) – (9) thus ensure that the trip is indeed a (0)-(𝑛+1) path. 

 Constraint set (10) states that the trip enters and departs a location 𝑖 exactly once if there 

is a facility at this location (i.e., 𝑌/ = 1). Constraint set (11) – (13) is the MTZ subtour elimination 

constraints introduced by Miller, Tucker, and Zemlin [49]. Note that if 𝑗 follows 𝑖 in the TSP route, 

𝑍/1 = 1 implies 𝑌1 = 1 and 𝑈1 ≥ 𝑈/ + 𝑌1 > 𝑈/. Suppose there exists a subtour (𝑖, 𝑗, … 𝑖), with 𝑖 ≠

0, 𝑛 + 1. Then, 𝑈1 > 𝑈/ > 𝑈1 leads to a contradiction. Note that if location 𝑖 is not a part of the trip 

(in which case 𝑌/ = 0 by Constraint set (10)), the values of 𝑈/ are irrelevant to the problem as long 

as they satisfy the constraints. Constraint sets (14) – (18) are self-explanatory. 

Having  to  solve  this  MIP  on  a  regular  basis  can  be  computationally  expensive  or  even 

impossible when n is large. In the next section, we introduce a machine learning approach that 

leverages the MIP to solve this problem. 

3. Proposed learning mechanism 

We start by formally defining the learning models to solve the combined SCP and TSP, and discuss 

how we iteratively update the model parameters. Suppose the optimal solution to Program 1 is 

given by the vector (𝑿∗, 𝒀∗, 𝒁∗). The proposed framework is to establish two supervised machine 

learning  models  that  can  be  trained  to  find  this  vector  given  a  set  of  problem  parameters.  In 

particular, given a graph 𝑮 along with its associated location and cost information, Model 1 will 

be used to derive (𝑿∗, 𝒀∗). That is, Model 1 is trained to provide the portion of the optimal solution 

corresponding to the set covering problem, while also accounting for the TSP cost that this results 

9 

 
in (in addition to the location and assignment costs). Recall that 𝑌1, as a component of 𝒀, is a binary 

variable that represents whether the facility in a particular location 𝑗 is open or not. Model 1 is 

trained to generate each component 𝑌1 of the vector 𝒀 as a value between 0 and 1 that corresponds 

to  the  probability  that  in  the  optimum  solution,  the  facility  at  location 𝑗 is  open.  Denoting  this 

vector of probabilities by 𝒈(𝒀) we could define Model 1 via the following map:  

Model 1 (SCP predictor): 𝑮 ® 𝒈(𝒀) 

Note that 𝒈(𝒀) is used to derive a vector 𝒀\ that is a prediction of 𝒀, and also a vector 𝑿\ that is a 

prediction of assignments given by 𝑿. We will discuss this later in Section 3.4. 

On the other hand, Model 2 establishes the relationship between (𝑮, 𝒀) and (𝒁), i.e., it is 

trained to use the graph described by 𝑮 and the facility locations defined by 𝒀∗ to determine the 

optimal TSP sequence in 𝒁∗. In particular, given 𝒀, Model 2 is trained to generate a set of values 

between  0  and  1  for  each 𝑍/1  that  correspond  to  the  probability  that  location 𝑖 is  followed  by 

location 𝑗 in the optimal sequence. Defining these probabilities by matrix 𝒑(𝒁), we could define 

Model 2 via the following map: 

Model 2 (TSP predictor): (𝑮, 𝒀) ® 𝒑(𝒁) 

In the following sections we provide the detailed methodology to train each of Model 1 

and  Model  2,  and  discuss  how  the  models  can  be  used  to  derive  a  combined  solution  that  is 

guaranteed to be feasible. 

3.1 

Data generation and labeling 

To  begin  with,  we  generate  a  data  set  Train  with  graph  information 𝑮 that  contains  candidate 

facility locations and all relevant cost information. We also generate an example data set Test with 

graph information 𝑮′. For evaluation purposes, the data sets 𝑮′ and 𝑮 should be drawn from the 

10 

 
same overall pool, i.e., the elements of these two data sets, although different, resemble each other 

in  some  sense.  Finally,  we  generate  another  data  set  Testnew  with  graph  information 𝑮𝒏𝒆𝒘 that 

represents significantly different problems that are unseen in data sets Train and Test.  

We then use the MIP formulation that is proposed in Section 2 to solve the optimization 

problem on each of the instances in 𝑮, 𝑮′, and 𝑮𝒏𝒆𝒘. For each instance, we use the optimal solution 

(𝑿∗, 𝒀∗, 𝒁∗) to generate the corresponding vectors 𝒈(𝒀∗) and 𝒑(𝒁∗); note that for these instances 

𝒈(𝒀∗) and 𝒑(𝒁∗) have  values  of  0  or  1  for  all  components  since  the  “probabilities”  from  our 

optimal solutions are either 0 or 1. We also document each of the individual cost component in the 

optimal solution, namely, the optimal facility location cost, assignment cost, and TSP cost. 

3.2 

Training machine learning Model 1 (SCP predictor) 

In this step, we establish a Neural Network on Train that maps 𝑮 to 𝒈(𝒀), where the 𝑗bc element 

of 𝒈(𝒀) is the probability that 𝑌1

∗	= 1. From a pure optimization perspective, we would ideally like 

this value to be 1 or 0, depending on whether the facility at 𝑗 is open or closed. Our model is trained 

via  back  propagation,  and  the  hyperparameters  in  the  learning  process,  such  as  the  network 

architecture, the number of hidden layers and hidden units, the learning rate, the mini-batch size, 

activation functions and the number of epochs are tuned iteratively. To accomplish this, we further 

split dataset Train into a training set that comprises 90% of the elements in Train and a validation 

set that comprises the remaining 10% of the data set. Within an iteration, the hyperparameters are 

fixed and the model is trained using the training set with a pre-set number of epochs (one of the 

hyperparameters). At the end of each iteration, we obtain a model corresponding to the current set 

of hyperparameters. We then evaluate this model on the validation set. The hyperparameters are 

then  altered  for  the  next  iteration  based  on  how  the  model  performs  on  the  validation  set.  If 

11 

 
overfitting is observed, i.e., the model performs significantly better on the training set and worse 

on  the  validation  set,  then  regularization  layers  (typically  Dropout  layers)  are  added,  and  the 

number of activations and layers are reduced. On the other hand, if underfitting is observed, i.e., 

the model performs poorly on both sets, then more layers and activations are added. This process 

is repeated until no significant improvements are observed. 

It is important to note that in general, there is no guarantee that the integer values obtained 

by directly rounding the fractional 𝒈(𝒀) will lead to the optimal solution of Program 1. In fact, 

these  integer  values  might  not  even  lead  to  feasible  solution.  In  Section  3.4  we  will  present  a 

detailed discussion on how to convert 𝒈(𝒀) into a feasible Combined SCP and TSP solution. 

3.3 

Training machine learning Model 2 (TSP predictor) 

We train another Neural Network on Train that maps (𝑮, 𝒀) to 𝒑(𝒁), where element (𝑖, 𝑗) of 𝒑(𝒁) 

is the probability that 𝑍/1

∗ = 1. That is, it uses the graph information described by 𝑮 and the facility 

locations defined by 𝒀 to generate a matrix of probabilities 𝒑(𝒁) corresponding to the optimal TSP 

solution. The training process for Model 2 also follows the same approach described in Section 

3.2 for Model 1 of dividing Train into a training and validation set with similar hyperparameter 

tuning over a predetermined number of epochs. In the training process, we use the optimal vector 

𝒀∗ with its associated TSP path since the objective here is to train this model to find the optimal 

path for a given set of locations on a given graph. In the next section we discuss how to utilize 

Model 2 to generate a TSP route from 𝒑(𝒁) that visits each open location. 

3.4  Obtaining a feasible solution to Program 1 

In  Section  3.2  and  Section  3.3,  we  developed  probability  vectors 𝒈(𝒀) and  probability  matrix 

𝒑(𝒁). In this section, we use these results to derive a feasible solution to the combined SCP/TSP. 

12 

 
Recall  that  𝒈(𝒀)  corresponds  to  the  probabilities  associated  with  opening  a  facility  at  each 

location. For each example, we define a threshold 𝛼 and let 𝑌e/ = 1 if 𝑔(𝑌/) ≥ 	𝛼 and 𝑌e1 = 0 for all 

𝑗 with 𝑔(𝑌/) < 	𝛼,  i.e.,  we  use 𝛼 to  convert  the  vector  of  probabilities 𝒈(𝒀) into  the  discrete 

estimator 𝒀\ for use as the SCP solution. Note that in order to ensure that 𝒀\ is feasible, we need to 

ensure that (i) every location 𝑖 either has an open facility, or (ii) is assigned to a location 𝑗 with an 

open facility that is within a distance 𝐷 from it, i.e., 𝑌e1 = 1 with 𝑎/1 = 1. We use traversal search in 

Algorithm 1 to go over all examples and locations to check if either of these two conditions is 

meet  and  force  any  location 𝑖 that  does  not  meet  either  to  have  an  open  facility.  Note  that  all 

locations with open facilities are obviously assigned to the facility there, i.e., 𝑋e// = 1 if 𝑌e/ = 1, and 

any location where there is no open facility is assigned to the feasible open facility location that 

leads to the smallest assignment cost. The algorithm is summarized in Table 1.

Proposition  1: 𝑿\ and 𝒀\ that  are  generated  by  Algorithm  1  satisfy  Constraint  sets  (2)  –  (4)  in 

Program 1. 

Proof: The outer for loop iterates through each of all examples in our Train, Test, and Testnew 

dataset,  which  corresponds  to  an  optimization  problem.  The  inner  for  loop  further  iterates  all 

facility  location 𝑖,  whose 𝑔hij(𝑌/) should  be  either < 𝛼 or ≥ 𝛼 that  are  represent  by  the  outer 

if/else conditional statement. In the first part of the inner if/else statement, Constraint set (2) and 

(3) are satisfied by the condition, i.e., 𝑋1/

hij = 1 only if 𝑎/1

hij = 1 and 𝑔hij(𝑌/) > 𝛼 (which leads to 

hij = 1 in the second part of the outer if/else conditional statement). In all other parts, Constraint 
𝑌e

hij  =  1  with  𝑌e
set  (2)  and  (3)  are  also  satisfied  by  ensuring  that  𝑋e

//

hij  =  1  and  𝑎//

hij  =  1. 

Additionally, throughout the inner and outer if/else conditional statement, there exists one and only 

one 𝑗 such that 𝑋1/

hij = 1. Note that 𝑗 is the location with smallest assignment cost (and with the 

smallest index if there are multiple such 𝑗), or 𝑗 = 𝑖.           

         (cid:0) 

So far we have obtained 𝑿\ and 𝒀\ that constitute a feasible solution to the SCP. Next, we 

input (𝑮, 𝒀\) (𝑮′ or 𝑮𝒏𝒆𝒘 in Test and Testnew respectively) into Model 2 to obtain 𝒑(𝒁). Note that 

we do not input the true optimal solution 𝒀∗ into Model 2, because 𝒀∗ is assumed to be unknown

when conducting a valid end-to-end evaluation and comparison. In order to derive from 𝒑(𝒁) a 

feasible set of TSP routes given by 𝒁\, the routes are required to visit each of the open location in 

𝒀\ once, and only once. Note that the routes have to start from the origin (indexed by 0) and return 

to the origin (indexed by 𝑛+1). We start the transformation process with node 0, and look at 𝑺𝒆𝒙𝒑, 

hij = 1 for all 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛}. We find the node 𝑗 in 
the set of open facilities in an instance 𝑒𝑥𝑝 with {𝑖: 𝑌e
/

𝑺𝒆𝒙𝒑 with the largest probability 𝑝̂ hij4𝑍N15 (and with the smallest index if there are multiple such 

𝑗), i.e., 𝑗 is the most promising stop to follow node 0 in the optimal TSP route. We let 𝑍yN1 = 1 and 

remove 𝑗 from 𝑺𝒆𝒙𝒑. We continue with a similar process while adding open facilities to the TSP 

route until 𝑺𝒆𝒙𝒑 is empty. We summarize this algorithm in Table 2.

Proof: The outer for loop iterates through each of the examples in our Train, Test, or Testnew 

dataset, which corresponds to an optimization problem. Lines 1, 2 and 3 in the for loop ensures 

that Constraint sets (5) and (6) are satisfied, and the last line ensures that Constraints set (7) and 

(8) are satisfied. Note that we have 𝑍y

first line in the first iteration in the while loop, while 𝑖 is the last node selected when the while 

loop terminates. Constraints set (9) and (10) are ensured by iteratively selecting one, and only one 

hij = 1; the 𝑗 then becomes the next 𝑖 and 
𝑗 throughout the iterations in the while loop and assign 𝑍y

the next 𝑗 is then selected similarly until all node in 𝑺𝒆𝒙𝒑 are visited. Therefore, ∀1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛, we

defined as a (0)-(n+1) path that does not visit all of the open facilities in 𝑺𝒆𝒙𝒑. Note that according

Evaluating the end-to-end mechanism 

We use the overall cost that is defined by the objective function (1) in Program 1 as the basis for 

evaluating the performance of our end-to-end ML-based mechanism to solve the Combined SCP 

and TSP problem. In the next section, we provide a detailed demonstration of how our approach 

performs  by  using  a  case  study  that  is  based  upon  the  World  Health  Organization’s  vaccine 

distribution  chain,  and  provide  numerical  results  with  data  derived  from  four  countries  in  sub-

Saharan Africa. 

4. An illustration: mobile clinics and outreach operations 

Vaccination  has  been  proven  to  be  the  most  effective  method  to  prevent  infectious  diseases. 

However, vaccine distribution chains can be extremely complex in many low and middle-income 

countries with geographically dispersed and nomadic populations, and there are thus still almost 

20 million children in low and middle-income countries who remain at risk and are not covered by 

routine vaccines [50]. To address this problem, the World Health Organization (WHO) established 

the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 1974 to provide universal access to childhood 

17 

 
vaccines for all children. This program has successfully contributed to saving millions of lives 

worldwide [51]. Several papers have addressed the network design phase of the WHO vaccine 

distribution chains via mathematical programming [41], [52]–[55] where vaccine is assumed to be 

delivered to clinics via a fixed vaccine distribution chain. However, residents in remote locations 

in these countries often have no (or limited) direct access to clinics and hospitals. In these cases, 

outreach is typically utilized to raise immunization rates. A set of these remote population centers 

are chosen for locating mobile clinics and a team of clinicians and support personnel set up these 

mobile clinics periodically to vaccinate people in the immediate surrounding area.  

There  are  a  limited  number  of  mathematical  programming  models  to  help  determine 

optimal outreach strategies [56], [57], but none of these models looks at the problem on an ongoing 

basis  even  though  outreach  in  practice  is  done  at  regular  intervals  of  time,  and  the  underlying 

mathematical models are required to be solved repeatedly because the same plan is not followed 

each time. Yang and Rajgopal were the first to present quantitative models that consider updated 

model parameters and obtains revised plans for subsequent planning periods using a two-period 

Robust approach [58]. The authors present a method to economically plan for outreach and provide 

management insights on where to focus more attention, but when solving the mathematical model, 

it starts from scratch every time that the MIP needs to be solved. Thus, there are no mechanisms 

to learn from historical optimization solutions..  

4.1 

Problem definition 

While outreach has been proven to be an effective way to increase vaccination coverage rates in 

resource-deprived  regions,  there  is  no  standard  structure  or  process  for  outreach  across  all 

countries. In practice, a typical way that outreach is done is that a medical team departs from an 

existing clinic at a district center in a truck or van, while carrying vaccines in cold boxes along 

18 

 
 
with related supplies. The team then sets up at one or more mobile clinic location(s) to vaccinate 

residents in that area as well as residents from nearby areas. Per WHO’s guideline, a mobile clinic 

should be able to cover population centers that are within 5km of its location. In the outreach trip, 

if multiple locations are visited, the team goes to each of the locations sequentially and eventually 

returns  to  the  original  depot.  Although  there  are  often  significant  variations  in  economy, 

geography,  demography,  and  thus  no  standard  vaccine  regimens  and  outreach  practice  that  are 

identical across countries, this study aims to provide a relatively rigorous process for outreach trips 

across all countries to meet the WHO’s goal of providing universal access to the opportunity to be 

vaccinated.  

We take three sets of decisions into consideration: 1) choosing locations of mobile clinics 

as  a  subset  of  all  targeted  population  centers  to  be  covered;  2)  assigning  population  centers  to 

mobile clinics that are within the maximum coverage distance to that mobile clinic (each mobile 

clinic could serve multiple population centers, but a population center can only be assigned to one 

mobile clinic); and 3) vehicle trips that ensure that all mobile clinic locations are visited once and 

only once within some suitable planning horizon (e.g., 1 month). Within each planning horizon, 

only one vehicle trip is assumed to be undertaken and the vehicle must depart from a fixed depot 

and return to that depot after it visits all mobile clinic locations. The vehicles utilized in outreach 

trips  are  typically  trucks  or  vans  with  several  coolers  or  cold  boxes,  and  since  our  target 

populations  are  in  remote  and  sparsely  populated  area,  we  assume  that  these  vehicles  are  not 

capacitated  in  terms  of  how  much  vaccine  can  be  carried.  Therefore,  we  assume  that  each  trip 

could carry necessary clinical and support personnel along with the sufficient amount of vaccine 

for the location(s) that are served by the trip. In cases that the required vaccine volume is larger 

19 

 
than the capacity, a larger vehicle is acquired or a shorter planning horizon can be leveraged to 

conduct more outreach trip throughout the year.  

Three  components  of  costs  are  considered  in  planning  the  outreach  operation.  First,  we 

consider direct cost associated with running a mobile clinic at a particular location that includes 

the setup at the outreach site, labor costs for vaccination operations onsite, the cost of renting or 

obtaining space and storage devices, energy consumptions cost, and any other local cost. We also 

consider the cost of assigning population centers to a mobile clinic. This cost includes the cost of 

moving targeted newborns from other population centers without a mobile clinic, incentives paid 

to them to have them visit a mobile clinic, and estimated social and healthcare cost associated with 

people not visiting mobile clinics due to relative long travel distances. The assignment cost can be 

formulated as a linear function of distance from population centers to mobile clinic, although this 

is not crucial. Lastly, we consider trip-related cost that includes vehicle depreciation or vehicle 

rental costs, fuel costs, hourly wages/allowances paid to the team and driver. Note that this cost is 

assumed to be proportional to the duration of the trip, and we thus utilize an average cost per hour 

based on the trip duration to quantify it. In summary, the total cost is determined by the selected 

mobile clinics locations, distance from population centers to mobile clinics, and the route taken by 

the vehicle on the outreach trip. 

This process can be viewed as an example of a combination of the Set Covering Problem 

and the Traveling Salesman Problem as discussed in Section 1. The selection of mobile clinics can 

be viewed as the selection of facility locations in 𝒀, assigning population centers to the selected 

mobile clinics can be considered via assignment variables 𝑿, and the route to visit mobile clinics 

can be viewed as the TSP route 𝒁. Moreover, because the demand, traffic and road conditions in 

these  targeted  zones  are  typically  unstable,  it  can  be  challenging  to  obtain  an  accurate  set  of 

20 

 
estimates for these problem parameters ahead of time. For example, the demand at a population 

center is calculated by its population and the prevalent birth rate. Thinking of demand as being 

stochastic  can  sometimes  be  more  accurate,  as  both  the  population  and  the  birth  rate  within  a 

location could vary every year, or even within a particular year because of seasonal movements of 

the  population.  Similarly,  travel  time  and  assignment  cost  from 𝑖  to 𝑗  are  often  not  constant 

because road and traffic conditions in these targeted zones are often unstable. With extreme events 

such as epidemics, landslides or floods, traffic can be impacted or even blocked. On the other hand, 

improvements to infrastructure can also reduce travel times and assignment costs. Therefore, it 

would be ideal to determine a flexible strategy over every successive planning period. The outreach 

model thus needs to be solved periodically with similar parameter and inputs, where each instance 

corresponds  to  a  graph  with  one  depot  and  multiple  population  centers.  The  learning-based 

mechanism  described  in  Section  3  therefore  constitutes  a  promising  direction  from  which  to 

approach this problem, and we thus apply the methodology illustrated in Section 3 to solve this 

problem and present the numerical results using data derived from the WHO and four countries in 

sub-Saharan Africa. 

4.2 

Numerical results 

To present numerical results using the mobile clinic and outreach operations example, we selected 

30  unique  sets  of  targeted  populations  across  different  parts  of  four  countries  in  sub-Saharan 

Africa, and for each such set, we generated the node set of locations and 1,000 different examples 

using different combinations of cost data. This generated a total of 30,000 different instances. We 

ran  these  30,000  examples  on  Program  1  using  Gurobi  over  a  period  of  several  weeks,  and 

obtained the optimal solution vector (𝑿∗, 𝒀∗, 𝒁∗) for each instance. We also documented each cost 

component (facility location cost, assignment cost, and TSP cost) in each of the optimal solutions.  

21 

 
We then randomly picked 5 distinct sets of population centers from the 30 we started with 

and assigned all of the corresponding 5,000 examples associated with the 5 graphs in this set to 

dataset Testnew. For the remaining 25 population centers and the corresponding 25,000 instances, 

we randomly split these into 22,500 examples for dataset Train and 2,500 examples for dataset 

Test. Note that instances in Train and Test are drawn from the same pool of locations, so that the 

same population center and its associated graph could appear in both datasets, albeit with different 

cost information. However, the graphs in Testnew are all different from those in Train and Test. 

In  other  words,  the  instances  in  Train  and  Test  bear  some  resemblance  to  each  other,  unlike 

Testnew,  whose  instances  come  from  a  completely  different  set  of  population  centers  and  their 

graphs.  After  utilizing  the  method  introduced  in  Section  3.2  and  3.3  to  train  the  two  machine 

learning models on Train with the data set split into training and validation sets and parameter 

tuning after each iteration, we obtain the final model parameters. Given any instance, we then use 

machine learning Model 1 to obtain 𝒈(𝒀) followed by Algorithm 1 in Section 3.4 to obtain SCP 

solution 𝑿\ and 𝒀\. We then feed 𝑿\ and 𝒀\ into machine learning Model 2 to obtain 𝒑(𝒁) followed 

by Algorithm 2 to obtain TSP solution 𝒁\.  

We use the datasets Test and Testnew to evaluate how well the machine learning models 

(along with the two algorithms for obtaining a final solution) perform on data that is distinct from 

the data used to train. To evaluate the end-to-end performance of the approach, we compare the 

total  cost  of  the  solution  obtained  with  the  minimum  cost  obtained  by  solving  Program  1.  We 

started with a value of 0.5 for the threshold 𝛼 described in Section 3.4 since this would appear to 

be  a  natural  value  for  it  if  we  interpret  each  element  of  𝒈(𝒀)  as  the  probability  that  the 

corresponding variable is equal to 1. We summarize the numerical results for each component of 

cost in Table 3. For each component and data set, the entry in Table 3 is the ratio of the sum of the 

22 

 
costs for that component across all instances in the data set obtained from our approach, and the 

sum of the optimal costs for that component across the same instances obtained by solving the 

MIP (expressed as a percentage).

Since examples in Train and Test are drawn from a common pool of population centers, 

while examples in Testnew are from a completely different set of population centers, it is natural 

that the approach will yield better results with instances in Test than with instances in Testnew. The 

numerical results from data set Test should give us a fair measurement of the performance of the 

mechanism on future examples from node sets that have been solved before albeit with different 

cost parameters. On the other hand, data set Testnew presents a more “tough” test to measure the 

model’s  generality,  because  these  instances  use  node  sets  that  were  never  part  of  the  training 

process and thus no actual information on historical solutions is given to the learning mechanism.  

As shown in Table 3, with instances in Train and Test our approach is able to generate 

heuristic solutions that are on average about 1% more expensive than the optimal solution from 

solving Program 1. Because the mechanism utilized a train-validation splitting procedure within 

the  backend  training  and  hyperparameter  tuning  process,  overfitting  is  not  observed,  and  the 

mechanism preforms similarly on both data sets.  

23 

 
 
 
On  the  other  hand,  when  dealing  with  optimization  problems  with  a  different  pool  of 

population  centers  that  are  not  part  of  the  training  process,  the  model  is  not  able  to  generate 

solutions that are as good. In particular, it appears that  the machine learning approach performs 

notably worse on the Testnew set, and leads to facility costs that are 47.56% higher than the optimal 

cost. When it comes to new datasets that it has never seen, Model 1 is not as good at identifying 

the  correct  combination  of  facility  locations  to  cover  all  population  centers,  and  consequently 

Algorithm 1 turn out to be more “conservative” and opens a number of additional locations to 

ensure complete coverage, leading to higher facility costs. However, since more mobile clinics are 

selected,  the  corresponding  total  assignment  costs  are  only  41.23%  of  what  they  are  at  the 

optimum,  because  on  average,  with  more  clinic  locations  there  are  fewer  population  centers 

assigned to each clinic and population centers now get assigned to clinics that are closer. More 

clinics also lead to outreach trip costs that are 58.80% higher, since there are now more stops to 

visit in the final solution. Overall, the cost is around 46% higher than the optimal total cost on 

average. Note that in this study, it is more common to have higher facility and transportation cost, 

because vaccine has to be transported and stored in a very narrow range of temperature, and often 

times  special  types  of  storage  devices  and  vehicles  have  to  be  used.  In  the  optimal  solution, 

Program 1 thus tries to select fewer clinic locations, with each serving more population centers, 

as opposed to having more clinic locations serving fewer population centers. If the mechanism 

would be used in a scenario with more balanced cost components, we might expect it to perform 

better with the Testnew data set.  

One  observation  in  solving  via  this  mechanism  that  needs  to  be  mentioned  is  run  time. 

Although  the  training  procedure  can  take  several  hours  with  the  22,500  observations,  when  it 

actually comes to predicting probabilities and translating these into a feasible solution for a specific 

24 

 
instance, the time is negligible. On the other hand, solving the problem via Program 1 can take 

much  more  time,  and  in  applications  where  an  immediate  solution  is  desirable,  the  proposed 

mechanism  is  more  favorable  over  Program  1  once  training  has  been  completed.  Overall,  the 

mechanism is able to generate high quality results repeatedly for problems that resemble instances 

in  the  training  set,  but  when  it  encounters  totally  new  problems,  it  generates  more  expensive 

heuristic solutions but that are guaranteed to be feasible. 

4.3 

Selecting a value for the parameter 𝜶 

In Section 4.2 we discussed the numerical results when parameter 𝛼 is set to a natural value of 0.5 

and  is  consistent  throughout  the  implementation  of  Algorithm  1  on  Train,  Test  and  Testnew. 

However, as illustrated in Table 3, the total cost of our solutions on Testnew is significantly higher 

than the total cost based on the optimal solution. In particular, the facility cost in our solutions is 

higher than the optimum, and more facilities then lead to longer TSP routes, which in turn are also 

higher than the optimum, and these together overwhelm the reductions in assignment costs. To 

further study parameter 𝛼 and its impact on the total cost, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on 

parameter 𝛼. Table 4 reports each component of cost across instances in Testnew, similar to what 

we  had  in  Table  3  for 𝛼 = 0.5,  but  with  different  values  of  parameter 𝛼  from  0.1  to  0.9  in 

Algorithm 1. Note that 𝛼 is set to be consistent throughout each of the scenarios from 𝛼 = 0.1 to 

𝛼 = 0.9.

It  can  be  seen  that  as 𝛼 increases  from  0.1  to  0.9,  the  predicted  total  cost  in  Testnew 

improves  from  being  54.92%  higher  to  being  39.52%  higher  than  the  optimal  solution,  with  a 

decrease in facility cost and TSP cost from 58.62% and 68.46% higher to 38.48% and 51.08% 

higher,  respectively.  This  indicates  that  Algorithm  1  appears  to  perform  better  with  higher 𝛼 

values when the initial number of facility locations is relatively small. One possible explanation 

for this is that often times when two population centers are close to each other and also resemble 

each other in terms of their demand, from a machine learning perspective, Model 1 would tend to 

predict  similar  probabilities  for  locations  at  both.  In  situations  where  these  probabilities  are 

relatively large and 𝛼 is relatively small, Algorithm 1 yields a solution with facilities open at both 

locations. However, in practice we would only want a facility to be open at one of these locations; 

the other one could be covered by the open facility if the distance between the two is within the 

MCD, and many other population centers might be close enough to be served by either location. 

On the other hand, with a higher 𝛼, the likelihood of this happening is smaller because there will 

tend to be fewer open locations overall, thus reducing the likelihood of this type of duplication. 

26 

 
 
 
Furthermore, when the probabilities are on either side of 𝛼, but the difference is small (e.g.,0.89 

vs. 0.91, with 𝛼=0.9), higher values of 𝛼 could prevent both from being opened (in our example, 

only one facility will be opened, whereas both would be open with 𝛼 = 0.8.  

To further study this, we treated 𝛼 as a decision variable, and ran multiple threads of the 

process in Section 3.4 with different values of 𝛼 simultaneously. Here, for each specific instance 

in Testnew, we picked the value of 𝛼 that yields the minimum total cost (𝛼hij

∗

), and then calculate 

the corresponding cost components. In examining the values of  𝛼hij

∗

 that yielded the lowest total 

costs, we found that in 2,036 of the 5,000 instances (~41%), the choice of a value for 𝛼 made no 

difference at all. This is because the majority of the probabilities in these instances are in the range 

(0, 0.1), or (0.9, 1.0), so that any value of 𝛼 between 0.1 and 0.9 would give the same solution. In 

many other instances, there was a range of values for 𝛼hij

∗

 that yielded the same solution; in fact, 

in  over  75%  of  the  instances  there  were  at  least  three  (consecutive)  values  for 𝛼hij

∗

 that  were 

optimal.   

To understand this better, Figure 1 shows the count of different values of 𝛼 that are optimal 

across the 5,000 instances in Testnew, noting again that in general we have multiple optimal of 

∗
𝛼hij

 at the same time for almost all instances. Figure 1 also shows that our solutions improve as 

𝛼 increases and in 4,577 instances (~92%) the value of 𝛼=0.9 yielded the best solution from using 

our approach. In Table 5 we further compare each individual component of cost to the optimum, 

similar to what we had in Table 4. The first row in Table 5 summarizes costs when we pick 𝛼 =

∗
𝛼hij

 for each instance. Overall, our results indicate that simply picking a value of 𝛼=0.9 provides 

us with virtually the same result (139.52% from the last row of Table 4) as picking the best possible 

value for 𝛼	(=𝛼hij

∗

) for each instance (138.75% from the first row of Table 5).  As a matter of 

interest we also show in each subsequent row of Table 5 cost comparisons from different values 

27 

 
of 𝛼 from 0.1 to 0.9, but only for those instances for which 𝛼 = 𝛼hij

∗

. Again, comparing the last 

row of Table 4 with the first and last rows of Table 5 shows that a value of 0.9 for 𝛼 yields the best 

results for the vast majority of instances.

in Algorithm 1 via machine learning, and include it as a component of the output in Model 1: 

Model 1′: 𝑮 ® 𝒈(𝒀), 𝛼 

i.e.,  Model  1′ not  only  establishes  the  probability  that  in  the  optimum  solution,  the  facility  at 

location 𝑗 is open, but also the threshold to consider opening the facility at location 𝑗 in Algorithm 

1. Note that the training process of Model 1′ must be iterative, because the 𝛼∗ is unknown until 

the different threads of the whole mechanism including Model 2 is completed in parallel.  

Second, as discussed in Section 4.3, Model 1 tends to predict similar probability when two 

nearby population centers resemble each other. With a small 𝛼, we could end up with both having 

open facilities, and this results in much higher facility costs then necessary. This leads to another 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
promising  direction  in  the  future  to  utilize  techniques  such  as  Convolutional  Neural  Network 

(CNN) to ensure that the Set Covering model considers the correlation between population centers. 

Third,  there  could  be  a  mechanism  with  feedback  between  the  models,  as  opposed  to 

training each independently. As a new direction, we could leverage the information that is available 

within each machine learning model to help with improvement across both models. For example, 

the TSP cost that is calculated from Model 2 can be viewed as a function of the output of Model 

1 (which is the SCP solution). If the TSP cost that is incurred by a particular SCP solution can be 

utilized  as  intermediate  information  when  training  Model  1,  it  is  possible  that  Model  1  could 

generate better SCP solutions that leads to smaller overall cost. One way of doing this might be to 

initially use an approximation of the TSP cost to help speed up the learning process. Overall, this 

direction requires a more sophisticated methodology to implement. 

Fourth, in Section 4, because all examples considered in the demonstration have a similar 

number of population centers (around 10), we utilized a standard, fully connected neural network 

in the implementation of Model 1 and Model 2. This places some limitations on the generality of 

the mechanism and the possibility of utilizing the mechanism to solve problems with potentially 

more nodes. In many real-world circumstances, the number of facility locations could vary over a 

wider  range  and  could  be  unknown  before  the  start  of  the  training  process.  This  points  to  the 

possibility of using more general, sequential neural networks whose dimension of input is not fixed 

(unlike with the standard version we used). For example, using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) 

such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks could potentially alleviate this problem. In 

developing RNN, we can use a structure similar to LSTM that is widely used in Natural Langrage 

Processing and time-series analysis. Information that is related to a particular node in our graph 

can be fed into the RNN sequentially, and the predicted probabilities related to this node along 

30 

 
 
with  the  information  of  the  next  node  are  then  fed  into  the  next  unit  of  the  RNN,  until  the 

information across all nodes is fed into the model and all prediction results are obtained.  

Fifth,  in  this  work  the  training  procedure  to  establish  the  machine  learning  models  is 

conducted on the entire training dataset before the prediction process. However, in most situations, 

especially when inputs are coming in as a flow or when optimal solutions may change dynamically 

over time because of changes in parameter values, the machine learning models also need to be 

updated over time. One natural way is to retrain the models on the entire training set over time 

after a given set of planning horizon, but this could be time consuming. Alternatively, we could 

define a preselected number of inputs as a “batch” and once we receive a whole batch of new input, 

we update the parameters of the machine learning models sequentially by batch. This technique is 

often referred to as online learning, or incremental learning, and is widely used when near real-

time inputs are present. 

Lastly,  from  an  implementation  standpoint,  we  would  like  to  seek  more  real-world 

circumstances  that  are  applicable  for  the  mechanism.  There  are  often  two  challenges.  First,  to 

obtain mechanisms that are more consistent and general, it is necessary to have a different number 

of  nodes,  and  a  wider  range  of  different  parameter  distributions.  The  historical  optimization 

solution should also be available to train the machine learning model. Secondly, there must be a 

need to have the optimization model solved repeatedly and rapidly. 

6. Summary  

This paper aims to provide an early explorations and experiments in leveraging a machine learning 

algorithm to solve a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. We first study the combined Set 

31 

 
 
Covering  and  Traveling  Salesmen  problem,  and  formulate  this  problem  as  a  Mixed  Integer 

Program. When the optimization problem needs to be solved on a regular basis with similar input 

values,  it  starts  from  scratch  as  new  inputs  and  parameters  are  given.  This  could  lead  to  high 

computational  expense  as  well  as  tractability  issues.  To  address  this,  we  introduce  a  machine 

learning based mechanism to solve this problem by leveraging historical optimal solutions. The 

mechanism  can  be  utilized  to  efficiently  generate  heuristic  solutions  via  two  machine  learning 

models  that  are  dedicated  to  solving  the  Set  Covering  Problem  and  the  Traveling  Salesmen 

Problem  separately,  but  are  aimed  at  minimizing  overall  cost.  We  discuss  data  generation  and 

preprocessing, model training, and how to generate feasible solutions using the machine learning 

results. We also discuss how to compare the overall cost of the machine learning based mechanism 

to the optimal cost that is generated by the optimization formulation. We then present a detailed 

case study for the World Health Organization’s vaccine distribution chain, and provide numerical 

results  with  data  derived  from  four  countries  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  after  several  train-test-

evaluation  iterations.  Based  on  the  computational  performance  observed,  the  machine  learning 

based mechanism appears to be a promising way to achieve tractability and scalability without 

significantly sacrificing solution quality, but it still requires significant further development and 

should  supplement  the  current  exploratory  approaches  of  incorporating  machine  learning  with 

optimization.
