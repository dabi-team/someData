ABSTRACT

In this work, we present a catalogue of cataclysmic variables (CVs) identiﬁed from the Sixth Data
Release (DR6) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). To
single out the CV spectra, we introduce a novel machine-learning algorithm called UMAP to screen
out a total of 169,509 Hα-emission spectra, and obtain a classiﬁcation accuracy of the algorithm of over
99.6% from the cross-validation set. We then apply the template matching program PyHammer v2.0
to the LAMOST spectra to obtain the optimal spectral type with metallicity, which help us identify
the chromospherically active stars and potential binary stars from the 169,509 spectra. After visually
inspecting all the spectra, we identify 323 CV candidates from the LAMOST database, among them 52
objects are new. We further discuss the new CV candidates in subtypes based on their spectral features,
including ﬁve DN subtype during outbursts, ﬁve NL subtype and four magnetic CVs (three AM Her
type and one IP type). We also ﬁnd two CVs that have been previously identiﬁed by photometry, and
conﬁrm their previous classiﬁcation by the LAMOST spectra.

1. INTRODUCTION

Cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) are semi-detached
binary systems with short orbital periods ranging from
shorter than one hour to longer than six hours (Warner
2003; Zorotovic et al. 2016). They typically consist
of a white dwarf star and a late-type main-sequence
companion. With the loss of angular momentum, the
mass transfer is continuously or intermittently activated
through the inner Lagrangian point of the Roche lobe,
usually leading to the formation of an accretion disc.

The CVs can be divided into several types: classical
nova (CN), recurrent nova (RN), dwarf nova (DN), nova-
like variables (NL), polars (or AM Her type), and inter-

mediate polars (IPs, including DQ Her type) (Warner
2003). The latter two are magnetic CVs. Note that
in polars, the magnetic ﬁeld is typically stronger than
20 MG that an accretion disc can not form. Classical
novae usually have only one observed eruption by def-
inition.
If a classical nova is observed with a second
eruption, it will be classiﬁed as a recurrent nova. Dwarf
novae usually have frequent and regular bursts as a re-
sult of instability of the accretion disk (Morales-Rueda
& Marsh 2002). U Gem stars are the prototype of DN
subtype of CVs which have repeated normal outbursts.
The SU UMa subtype of DNs presents superhumps in
addition to normal outbursts and the Z Cam subtype
of DNs are characteristic of standstills in the light curve
(Szkody 1987; Hellier 2001). Nova-like objects (NLs) are
recognized as novae between eruptions and do not have
a recorded outburst. Some NLs have been observed to
occasionally change from a high state with higher bright-

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

ness to a low state with lower brightness (La Dous 1994;
King & Cannizzo 1998; Rodr´ıguez-Gil et al. 2015). In
the AM Her systems, the magnetic ﬁeld of the white
dwarf is strong enough for both stars to be locked into
the same rotation period. In this system, the mass ﬂow
is controlled by the magnetic ﬁeld and falls directly to-
ward the surface of the white dwarf. Correspondingly,
the accretion disk of IPs is truncated at the radius of the
magnetosphere. Sometimes these two types of magnetic
CVs are referred to jointly as one subtype of nova-like
variables (Coppejans et al. 2015).

As a special kind of interacting binary systems, CVs
have complex physical processes and unique observation
properties in various wave bands and show luminosity
variations of diﬀerent time scales and amplitudes. They
are important samples that help us to understand the
evolution of binary stars and even the explosion mech-
anism of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) (Hachisu & Kato
2001; Anupama 2011). The acquisition and analysis of
more CV samples are helpful to the reﬁning of the the-
oretical models of CVs.

So far, numerous works have been conducted to search
for CVs. Downes et al. (2001) published a catalogue
including spectra, which is a revision and supplement
to the ﬁrst two editions (Edition 1 - Downes & Shara
(1993) and Edition 2 - Downes et al. (1997)). This cat-
alogue consists of 1034 CVs and 194 non-CV objects.
Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) I/II, Szkody
et al. (2011) published a summary table of 285 CVs with
the SDSS spectra. Jiang et al. (2013) identiﬁed CVs
from the low-resolution spectra of LAMOST by using
the support vector machine technique (SVM) combined
with principal component analysis (PCA). They identi-
ﬁed 10 cataclysmic variables, of which two are new CV
candidates. Breedt et al. (2014) provided spectroscopic
identiﬁcation of 85 systems fainter than g≥19 mag and
analyzed the photometric properties of the 1043 CV can-
didates from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey
(CRTS). Coppejans et al. (2016) published an outburst
catalogue which contains a wide variety of observational
properties for 722 dwarf nova-type CVs and 309 CVs of
other types from the CRTS. By cross-matching the pub-
lished catalogues with LAMOST DR3, Han et al. (2018)
collected 48 known CVs, and they found three new CVs
using the method adopted by Jiang et al. (2013). Szkody
et al. (2020) published 329 objects as known or candi-
date CVs during the ﬁrst year of testing and operation of
the Zwicky Transient Facility. Hou et al. (2020) used the
Bagging and the Random Forest algorithms to search for
CVs from LAMOST DR5, and they identiﬁed 245 cata-
clysmic variables, of which 52 CV candidates are new.

In this work, we present a catalogue of 323 CV candi-
dates identiﬁed from LAMOST DR6, of which 52 objects
are new. The structure of this paper is as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes the method and process to identify the
CV candidates according to the spectral features. Sec-
tion 3 presents the results. Section 4 is the discussion of
the spectral properties and subtype classiﬁcation of the
LAMOST CV candidates. Section 5 is the summary.

2. DATA

The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic
Telescope (LAMOST) is a 4-meter quasi-meridian re-
ﬂecting Schmidt telescope (Zhao et al. 2012; Cui et al.
2012) that is operated by the National Astronomical
Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences. With
a ﬁeld of view of 20 deg2 and 4000 ﬁbers at its fo-
cal plane, LAMOST can obtain up to 4000 spectra in
one exposure and it has been the most eﬃcient tele-
scope for spectral acquisition in the world. Up to July
2018, LAMOST has completed its pilot survey and the
ﬁrst six years of regular survey which was initiated on
September 2012. After the six-year-survey, the whole
data (DR6) were released in 2018, containing 9,911,337
low-resolution spectra. They are ﬂux(relatively)- and
wavelength-calibrated, sky-subtracted and have a reso-
lution of R ∼ 1800 at 5500˚A and a wavelength coverage
of 3700˚A ≤ λ ≤ 9000˚A. Each spectrum is spliced by
the blue part and the red part. The integration time is
600, 1500 or 1800 seconds. All the low-resolution spec-
tra were generally classiﬁed into diﬀerent types through
the pipeline including 9,231,057 stellar spectra, 177,270
galaxy spectra, 62,168 quasar spectra, and 440,842 spec-
tra marked as unknown. The massive spectral database
obtained by LAMOST is a rich resource for us to iden-
tify diﬀerent kinds of peculiar stars. As CVs are one
kind of valuable objects, searching them from the mas-
sive database is of much importance. And a larger CV
catalogue is greatly helpful for follow-up studies.

3. METHOD

We ﬁrst introduce a machine learning algorithm called
UMAP for screening out the spectra with prominent
Hα emission features, which leads to a total of 169,509
spectra. The sample data used for supervised machine
learning comes from 10 published CV or X-ray binary
catalogues which are: Downes & Shara (1993); Downes
et al. (1997); Downes et al. (2001); Szkody et al. (2011);
Jiang et al. (2013); Breedt et al. (2014); Coppejans et al.
(2016); Han et al. (2018); Ritter & Kolb (2003); Hou
et al. (2020). The PyHammer v2.0 program is intro-
duced to ﬁt the LAMOST low-resolution spectra to help
the manual inspection. There are two rounds in our

manual inspection.
In the ﬁrst round, those spectra
of late-type main-sequence stars with enhanced chro-
mospheric activities are removed. In the second round,
we identify the early-type emission-line stars, pre-main-
sequence, and other types of non-CV emission-line ob-
jects. For the left, we ﬁnally picked out the potential
CV candidates.

3.1. Hα classiﬁcation based on machine learning

As the Hα is common to be an emission line for CV
spectra, we ﬁrst screen out the spectra with Hα emission
features from the whole LAMOST DR6 database.

3.1.1. Training sample

To obtain initial samples for supervised machine learn-
ing, we ﬁrst cross-match the above mentioned 10 pub-
lished catalogues with the LAMOST DR6 database.
We manually examine each of the spectra in the cross-
matching result and remove those that do not show Hα
emission features. Thus, we obtaine 392 specrta with
Hα emission features. Note that not all these spectra
are actually CVs, as long as they show Hα emission
features. The wavelength range 6530-6600 ˚A of these
spectra are extracted out as an input to the machine
learning program (see Figure 1.) In order to avoid loss
of CVs during outbursts, those spectra that have Hα
wide absorption with emission cores are included in the
sample. The double-peaked Hα proﬁle is also included
in the sample.

Then we randomly select 1000 spectra in the whole
LAMOST DR6 database. We manually check the Hα
line features, retaining those without typical Hα emis-
sion features, and obtain 973 spectra that can be used
as controls in the supervised machine learning.

Figure 1. These are 16 examples of 392 sample spectra
that are used for machine-learning training. The wavelength
segment 6530-6600 ˚A associated with the Hα emission line is
extracted out and used to screen for the same Hα emission
line features.

Figure 2. After dimension reduction by UMAP to 3 dimen-
sions, 392 Hα-emission spectra and 973 randomly selected
spectra without Hα emission can be separated clearly.

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
(UMAP) is a novel machine-learning algorithm for di-
mension reduction proposed by McInnes et al. (2018),
which is based on the mathematical framework of Rie-
mannian geometry and algebraic topology. UMAP
tends to preserve more of the global structure in dimen-
sion reduction while many other algorithms like PCA
(Principal Components Analysis) seek to preserve the
distance structure within the data. UMAP is also ca-
pable of preserving the local ﬁne structure while still
retaining much of the large-scale global structure like
how PCA does. Thus, UMAP has natural advantages
for dimension reduction of nonlinear data. Through our
tests, the PCA algorithm often has the problem that
the classiﬁcation boundary in parameter space is not
clear in comparison with the result of the UMAP algo-
rithm, and may cause large contamination. Moreover,
UMAP also shows superior run time performance for
high-dimensional massive data compared to PCA. We
therefore select UMAP as the dimension reduction algo-
rithm for the high-dimensional spectral data. K-Nearest
Neighbour (k-NN) is a common machine learning clas-
siﬁcation algorithm. The k-NN classiﬁer is utilized to
classify the data after the dimension reduction.

After training with the selected samples and testing
several groups of parameters in the UMAP with k-NN
algorithm, 392 sample spectra with Hα emission features
and 973 without Hα emission features can be clearly
separated in the three-dimensional space, as shown in
Figure 2. The same algorithm is applied to all spectra
in the LAMOST DR6 database, and we obtain a to-
tal of 169,509 Hα-emission spectra. After we conduct a
ﬁve-fold cross-validation (Shao 1993), we obtain an clas-
siﬁcation accuracy of over 99.6% in the cross-validation
set.

3.2. PyHammer v2.0

Figure 3. Examples of spectral ﬁtting results obtained by
using the Pyhammer v2.0 program. We use such spectra to
identify the continuum and screen out the late type main
sequence stars aﬀected by chromosphere activity.

The PyHammer v2.0 program was published by Roul-
ston et al. (2020) to give a more accurate classiﬁcation
of stellar spectra. We introduce this program to obtain
the optimal ﬁtted spectra as a reference for our manual
inspection. We have modiﬁed the code to ﬁt the LAM-
OST low-resolution spectra while still use the original
templates. In the ﬁrst round of manual inspection, those
spectra that can be ﬁtted well to the G/K/M-type tem-
plates considered as normal main-sequence stars with
enhanced chromospheric activities, are removed. The
spectra of this kind make up about half of the total
169,509 Hα-emission spectra. After removing the chro-
mospherically active stars from the ﬁrst round, we go
through the rest of the spectra to ﬁnally pick out CV
candidates. Figure 3 shows some examples of the spec-
tral ﬁtting using PyHammer v2.0.

3.3. Manual inspection

3.3.1. CV features

Typical CV spectra show a high-temperature contin-
uum superimposed with strong emission lines, which are
mainly Balmer and He I/He II lines. An important fea-
ture is that the line width of Balmer and helium emission
lines appear to be signiﬁcantly broad in most CV spec-
tra, i.e. 70 ˚A for Hα. Thus the existence of uniformly
broad Balmer and He I/He II emission lines is a general
criterion to identify CVs. The CV spectra usually do not
have a steep decrement towards the higher order of the
Balmer series as they can be seen up to H8 or higher.
The strongest Balmer line may usually be Hα to Hδ.
The line width of the helium emission lines is usually
close to that of the Balmer lines. The double-peaked
line proﬁles present in the Balmer and He emission lines
indicate the existence of a rotating accretion disk. Ac-
cording to Knigge et al. (2000), when the disk is self-

occulted, the double-peaked emission lines tend to be
narrower and straighter, which may be the reason of the
straight double-peaked proﬁles in some CV spectra. In
some cases, the Ca II H/K and Ca II triple lines also show
broad emission, and the superposition of Ca II H and H(cid:15)
lines make H(cid:15) appear stronger (close to or beyond Hδ)
than it originally is. Moreover, when a spectrum is dom-
inated by the companion’s contribution (often a M-type
spectrum), the blue continuum would show an excess
compared to the single M-type star. However, it is pos-
sible that at certain orbital phases the emission lines are
obscured due to the eclipses, so that the spectrum does
not show any CV feature. For very rare cases such as
AM CVn systems, they do not have hydrogen lines due
to the hydrogen-deﬁcient nature.

For those spectra observed during outbursts, the
Balmer lines show absorption through optically thick
materials. The central emission cores can be absent
at outburst peak and become larger if the spectrum is
slightly past outburst. The central emission cores often
present in all visible Balmer series, and the Hα emission
core is usually strong enough to maintain higher than
the continuum (this can be called a core emission). The
He I lines are also aﬀected by wide absorption, while in
many cases He II λ4686 is still an emission line. Dur-
ing outbursts, He I λ6678 behaves similarly to Hα which
usually shows emission and higher than the continuum.
In some rare cases, the absorption lines are very strong,
which cause the emission core of He I λ6678 to be lower
than the continuum.

Although in some cases the Balmer emission lines can
be quite narrow, asymmetric broadening components
can be found at the line wings that meet our empiri-
cal criteria of 24 ˚A, thus the spectra can be classiﬁed as
CV candidates. Some of these cases belong to the AM
Her-type CVs, for which the TiO absorption bands from
the companion can be identiﬁed in low states. As men-
tioned in Warner (2003), the spectral lines in AM Her-
type CVs can display a combination of a broad ‘base’
component and narrow components due to a combina-
tion of contributions of emission in the stream and pole
regions. We ﬁnd that the known AM Her-type CVs can
be identiﬁed by the complex line structures and the pro-
ﬁle diﬀerences between Balmer lines. The emission lines
of AM Her-type CVs are more complicated than those
of IPs. Strong He II λ4686 lines are common in NLs
and magnetic CVs. For AM Her-type CVs, He II λ4686
are often stronger than or comparable to Hβ. How-
ever, in the spectra of some known AM Her-type CVs,
He II lines including He II λ4686 are very weak or absent.
Accordingly, He II lines are signiﬁcant in the spectra of
the known IPs (the strength ratio of He II λ4686/Hβ ≥

0.5, or He II λ4686 is close to but sightly weaker than
Hβ). In NLs, the relative strength of C III/N III λ4560 to
He II λ4686 emission lines is generally greater than that
in magnetic CVs, and in some cases, C III/N III λ4560
emission lines are as strong as He II λ4686. Also, the
emission lines of NLs can be narrower during low states
than in higher states (Rodr´ıguez-Gil et al. 2020). As C II
emission lines appear commonly in NLs but not in DNs,
the presence of C II lines can be an important feature to
distinguish between the NL and the DN subclass.

More spectral line features of diﬀerent subtypes of CV
from the LAMOST observations have been described
in Hou et al. (2020). For the manual inspection, the
empirical criteria we chose to identify the potencial CVs
are listed below:

• The apparent line width of Hα is greater than or

equal to 24 ˚A,

• He I λ6678 emission line presents in the spectra
and it is not too narrow (less than 14 ˚A) compared
to Hα; or other He emission lines present,

• Balmer series or He lines show double-peaked pro-

ﬁles,

• Balmer series show wide absorption with emission
cores and the emission cores can be seen at the
Balmer series higher than Hγ.

Satisfying any of the above criteria will allow us to
inspection process. For
mark it out in the manual
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) spectra, when limited
Balmer series or only the Hα emission line can be iden-
tiﬁed visually, they will be included as a CV candidate.

3.3.2. Inspection process

chine learning program has been inspected manually in

mospherically active main-sequence stars (which can be
ﬁtted well to the G/K/M-type templates) by visually
checking the whole spectra.
In this process, we com-
pare the LAMOST spectra with the ﬁtted template by
PyHammer v2.0 program to check whether there is an
excess at the blue end. The remaining spectra, including
those well-ﬁtted to the O/B/A/F-type templates and bi-
nary star templates, as well as those not well-ﬁtted to
the templates (many CVs fall into this category), are re-
tained for the second round. In the second round, we vi-
sually check the detailed spectral features carefully and
single out those spectra that have CV features. Near
the galactic plane, stellar spectra may be aﬀected by
the H II regions. By examining the presence of He ab-
sorption lines, we can remove the contaminations of the

5

Oe/Be stars. By judging the line width of Hα, we can
remove the H II regions.

4. RESULTS

Finally, we obtained 475 spectra for 323 objects in
total from LAMOST DR6. After checking the SIMBAD
database, we ﬁnd 271 known CVs or CV candidates, and
52 objects are new.

4.1. Distribution

The spatial distribution of the identiﬁed CVs is shown
in Figure 4. The upper diagram is in equatorial coordi-
nate, while the lower diagram is in galactic coordinate.
For the 224 objects indentiﬁed by Hou et al. (2020) from
LAMOST DR5, our results cover 215 of them, and nine
of them are not recovered in our results.
In Section
4.2, we will speciﬁcally discuss why these nine objects
are not included in our results. From Figure 4, we can
see that the known CVs in LAMOST DR6 v2 are dis-
tributed evenly in space. The new CV candidates are
more abundant near the galactic plane; however, they
are especially rare in the northern galactic latitudes.
Figure 5 shows the SNR distributions in g and i band for
the LAMOST data. We can see that with our method,
we have found more CV candidates with lower SNRs
than those of Hou et al. (2020) in LAMOST DR6.

4.2. Cross-match with Hou et al. 2020

Hou et al. (2020) have presented 245 CV candidates
from LAMOST DR5 and 224 objects are found in LAM-
OST DR6 v2 by cross-matching the coordinates. Out of
these 224 objects, we have 215 objects in common with
Hou et al. (2020) and nine objects are not included in
our results (see Figure 6). We give the reasons why we
lost these nine objects.

The spectrum of J0117 is aﬀected by the bad qual-
ity. The red part is ﬂat and does not have any feature,
while the blue part shows an abnormally violent change.
Therefore, in our manual inspection, we consider this
spectrum unreliable and don’t include it in our results.
J1234 is the prototype star and is a representative of
the AM CVn-type systems with hydrogen-deﬁcient. Due
to the lack of Hα emission, our results do not include
this type objects. The two spectra of this object do
not show visible hydrogen lines on the high-temperature
continuum, and He I lines on the blue part show broad
absorption with partial ﬁlling at the center.

J0403 has two spectra in which the Balmer lines show
deep absorption with emission cores, and He I lines show
weak emission cores. Because the Hα emission core does
not exceed the continuum, the UMAP algorithm failed
to screen it out, but it can be a CV candidate as the

torial coordinates and galactic coordinates respectively. The

sis of LAMOST DR6 v2. The orange spots are 20 conﬁrmed
new CV candidates in our results and the yellow spots are 32
possible new CV candidates. The red cross markers indicate
the 224 objects which are from cross-matching the result of
Hou et al. (2020) with LAMOST DR6 v2.

bars represent all 475 spectra in our result. The yellow bars
represent the 220 spectra which are from cross-matching the
result of Hou et al. (2020) with LAMOST DR6 v2.

Balmer emission cores exist up to H8 and He emission
lines are marginally visible.

The spectrum of J1446 shows a component of a white
dwarf on the blue part and a M-type companion on the
red part, and it is ﬁtted to the M3+DA2.5 template by
the PyHammer program. Because its Hα line shows an
emission core that does not exceed the continuum, the
UMAP algorithm fails to identify it.

J1844 is a known dwarf nova, showing strong absorp-
tion with emission cores for both Balmer and He I lines.
Its Hα line appears to have multiple components, and
the emission core at the center is below the continuum
so the UMAP algorithm fails to identify it.

The Balmer lines in the spectrum of J0043 show strong
absorption. Hβ and higher members of Balmer series are

partially ﬁlled up by emission components, while the Hα
is fully ﬁlled in so the UMAP algorithm fails to identify
it as a CV. The He emission lines are barely visible.

J0331 is a known dwarf nova. The only spectrum
shows very weak Balmer emission lines and the He lines
are almost invisible. As the spectrum can be ﬁtted to
the M4 main-sequence template and does not show an
excess on the blue end, we cannot identify it as a CV
from this spectrum.

One of the spectra of J0439 can be ﬁtted with the M6
template. The narrow Balmer emission lines may come
from chromospheric activities. The other two spectra of
this object show an indistinctive excess on the blue part,
and they lack He lines, so we do not include the object
in the manual inspection process. But it can still be a
possible CV candidate as it presents enhanced Balmer
emission lines and excess on the blue part compared with
the template.

The spectrum of J0712 does not show an excess on
the blue end relative to the M5 template, so we do not
include it in the manual inspection process. But the en-
hanced Balmer emission and absorption center at higher
Balmer lines still make it a possible CV candidate.

In conclusion, constrained by our machine learning
samples, the UMAP algorithm has some limitations to
perfectly classify the spectra that have strong wide ab-
sorption in Hα line with weak emission cores.
If the
spectra are dominated by the main-sequence star and
they don’t show an excess on the blue part or any ob-
vious emission lines, we can not identify it as a CV in
the manual inspection process. This phenomenon may
be due to high inclination and speciﬁc orbital phases,
which is relatively rare for CVs. In addition, a few spec-
tra are aﬀected by bad quality or very low SNRs. We
considered them not trustworthy in the manual inspec-
tion and hence do not include them.

4.3. Cross-match with other catalogues

We examine the cases which were previously classiﬁed
as CV objects but are not included in our results from
analysis of the LAMOST spectra. We cross-match the
catalogs from the literature listed in section 3.1.1 with
LAMOST DR6. From the cross-matching result, a total
of 230 objects are classiﬁed as CVs or CV candidates in
the SIMBAD database, in which 193 objects are found
by us. For the rest 37 objects, three objects show CV
features in their LAMOST spectra, and are discribed
as follows. J1234, the prototype star of the hydrogen-
deﬁcient AM CVn system, and the dwarf nova J1844
have been explained in Section 4.2. J0713 (ASASSN-
14mv) is also an AM CVn-type object (Denisenko et al.
2014), which shows strong He I and He II emission lines

but doesn’t show hydrogen lines in its spectrum. The
other 34 objects do not show features that could be iden-
tiﬁed as CVs in their LAMOST spectra, though they
have been identiﬁed by spectroscopy or photometry.
The likely reason is that they are too faint or in a fainter
state that LAMOST can not obtain relatively high SNR
spectra. Also, it is possible that the emission regions
are obscured, or they were incorrectly identiﬁed as CVs
in the catalogue (e.g. 2MASS J01095921+2801244 in
Downes et al. (2001)).

4.4. New CV Candidates

In our result, 52 objects are newly identiﬁed as CV
candidates. Among them, 20 objects that can be classi-
ﬁed as CVs as they show broad Balmer and He emission
lines, are listed in Table 1. The other 32 objects, which
can be classiﬁed as possible CV candidates, are listed
in Table 2, as they lack some of the distinct features of
CVs, or the spectra may be aﬀected by abnormal cir-
cumstances, or they have a lower SNR. The 21 spectra
of 20 conﬁrmed CVs and 52 spectra of 32 possible CV
candidates are plotted in Figures 10 and 11 in the Ap-
pendix, respectively.

4.5. Catalogue Description

The 20 new conﬁrmed CVs are presented in Table 1,
while the 32 new possible CV candidates are shown in
Table 2. In Table 3, we present the 271 previously known
ones. The ﬁrst two columns of each table are the LAM-
OST obsid (a unique spectra ID) and designation. The
16 spectra from LAMOST DR6 v1 which no longer exist
in LAMOST DR6 v2 are marked by an asterisk before
their obsid number. Column (3)-(5) are the MJD, right
ascension and declination, respectively. Columns (6)-(8)
are the CV subtype identiﬁed by us, Hou et al. (2020),
and from SIMBAD, respectively. We mark all the new
CV candidates with a single asterisk and label the 52
spectra of 32 new possible CV candidates as ‘CV?’ in
column (6). If a source has more than one spectrum but
those spectra do not show CV characteristics, we leave
the row blank in column (6). Columns (9) and (10) are
the median magnitude and the magnitude diﬀerence be-
tween the maximum and minimum taken from the ZTF
DR4 data, respectively. The ZTF data are obtained by
best cross-matching coordinates within 2 arcsec.

Figure 6. Spectra of nine objects from the catalogue of Hou
et al. (2020) but are not found in our result. The wavelength
range is from 3700 ˚A to 9000 ˚A.

5.1. Objects of New CV Candidates

Among the new CV candidates, we ﬁnd some of them
showing interesting features and discuss them in the fol-
lowing subsections according to their subtypes.

5.1.1. DN in outburst

J0148, J0612, J0701, J0023, and J2112 reveal typically
spectral features of DNs undergoing outbursts, and the
wide absorption is visible in each Balmer line in the spec-
tra of these objects. We note that the Balmer lines for
J0148, J0612, J0701, and J2112 are narrow, for exam-
ple, the Hα is less than 24 ˚A, while J0023 shows slightly
broad emission components (the Hα emission core is
33 ˚A). Asymmetric central absorption also presents at
the Balmer emission cores in all the spectra.

There are two spectra of J0148 (Figure 10 on page
19). The emission of the Balmer series is signiﬁcant in
the middle of the wide absorption lines, while He I lines
are in emission and does not exhibit wide absorption
features. Thus, we can identify it as a DN in outburst.
The other spectrum mainly shows wide Balmer absorp-
tion lines. The variations of the two spectra observed
at diﬀerent times are shown in Figure 7. The spectrum
of MJD 57281 presents central emission cores of Balmer
lines, while Hα and He I λ6678 are almost pure emis-
sion. In the spectrum of MJD 57309, the Balmer lines
become nearly all absorption, while the Hα still presents
an obvious emission core. Although the multiple emis-
sion components with asymmetric features are not obvi-
ous, they can be seen in the absorption lines of Balmer
series higher than Hα. This means that the emission
components have a steeper decrement than those of the
absorption. Besides, He I λ6678 also shows very weak
emission. For these features above, the spectrum of
MJD 57309 is likely to be taken during the outburst
maximum (Warner 2003).

The spectrum of J0612 (Figure 10 on page 20) shows
narrow asymmetric core emissions with weak wide ab-
sorption in the Balmer series, and the He I λ4471, λ5876,
λ6678, λ7065 lines are also in emission.

In the spectrum of J0701 (Figure 10 on page 20), the
absorption lines are strong while the emission cores are
weak for the higher order Balmer series., and the He I
λ6678 line is aﬀected by the absorption.

The spectrum of J0023 (Figure 10 on page 19) shows
strong wide Balmer absorption with broad emission
cores, and there seems to be two emission components
of the Balmer lines. The He II λ4686 is a strong emission
line, and the C III/N III blend at 4650 ˚A is also in emis-
sion, which may indicate the presence of a hot emission
zone in the disk.

Figure 7. Two spectra of J0148 with MJDs 57821 and
57309, respectively, show variation. The wavelength range
is from 3700 ˚A to 9000 ˚A. The upper red line represents the
spectrum of MJD 57281, while the lower orange line for MJD
57309. The Balmer lines are indicated with dotted black
lines, and the He I, He II and Fe II lines are indicated with
dotted blue lines.

Figure 8. Upper panel: Two spectra of J0356, taken on
MJDs 56617 and 56684, respectively. The upper red line
represents the spectrum of MJD 56617, while the lower or-
ange line for MJD 56684. The Balmer lines are indicated
with dotted black lines, and the He I, He II and Fe II lines are
indicated with dotted blue lines. The wavelength range is
from 3800 ˚A to 8900 ˚A. Lower panel: the blue part and the
Ca II triplet region of the spectrum of MJD 56684 show the
anti-P Cyg proﬁle.

Figure 9. Three spectra of J0534+3423 are taken at MJDs
56358, 56981 and 57042, respectively. The black, red and
orange lines represent the spectrum taken at MJDs 57042,
56981 and 57042, respectively. The lines of Balmer series,
Na λ5895.6 and Ca II triplets are indicated with dotted black
lines. The wavelength range is from 3800 ˚A to 8900 ˚A.

5. DISCUSSION

14

The spectrum of J2112 (Figure 10 on page 20) shows
weak wide absorption of Balmer lines, while the weak
He I λ6678 line presents emission. The C III/N III blend
at 4650 ˚A is in emission, while He II is absent. Note that
Fe II lines are present in all of the spectra above.

5.1.2. Nova-like type

J0409, J0519, J0723, J0454, and J0457 mainly show
strong C III/N III emission features and C II lines, re-
sembling the NL subtype of CVs. The common central
absorption or double-peaked proﬁle in the emission lines
suggests the presence of disks.

J0409 (Figure 10 on page 19) presents peculiar fea-
tures of a high-temperature continuum along with ob-
vious Hα, Hβ, He I, He II, C III/N III, and C II emission
lines. The Balmer decrement is quite strong, and the
asymmetric double-peaked proﬁles present. The He II
λ4686 line and C III/N III blend are extremely strong,
which are much higher than the apparent strength of
Hα and Hβ. The strength of C III/N III is comparable
to that of He II λ4686. The Ca II H/K lines show single
narrow absorption, which could be due to interstellar
absorption. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that J2023, which is
also one of the newly discovered CV candidates, has very
similar features, while the prominent diﬀerence is that
in J2023 the He II λ4686 is absent, for which it can only
be classiﬁed as a possible NL.

J0723 (Figure 10 on page 20) shows strong Balmer
emission lines but weak He I lines. The Balmer lines
show asymmetric shapes and the strongest Balmer line is
Hα. For Hγ, an absorption center is present which may
indicate the existence of an accretion disk. The He II
λ4686 is much weaker than Hβ, while the C III/N III
blend is as strong as He II λ4686. The Ca II λ3934 line
shows narrow absorption, while C II λ7234 is in emission.
J0454 (Figure 10 on page 19) shows very broad
strong Balmer, He I, He II, and C II emission lines. The
C III/N III is about half the height of that of He II λ4686.
The broad and asymmetric double-peaked shapes in the
Balmer and He lines are signiﬁcant, which indicates that
there is an accretion disk.

The spectra of J0519 (Figure 10 on page 20) and J0457
(Figure 10 on page 19) have relatively low SNR. He II
λ4686 emission can be identiﬁed in both spectra. The
C III/N III emission possibly exists in J0519, while C II
λ7234 emission is visible in J0457. For J0519, the central
absorption is seen in the Balmer lines, which indicates
there is an accretion disk.

5.1.3. Magnetic CVs

Four new CV candidates, J0320, J0326, J0216, and
J0715, can be classiﬁed as magnetic CVs by the strong
He II emission and other spectral features.

J0320 (Figure 10 on page 19) shows strong broad
Balmer emission lines, the strongest being Hδ, and they
are all blue-shifted. He II λ4686 is stronger than Hβ.
He I λ7281, λ7065, λ6678, λ5876, λ4388, λ4471 and
λ4026 are in emission. The Na I D line shows very strong
absorption, which may be contributed by the compan-
ion star. The C III λ4634 and C IV λ5805 lines also show
emission. As He II λ4686 is strong and Balmer lines split,
this object could be a magnetic CV, possibly of AM Her
type.

J0326 (Figure 10 on page 19) reveals an M-type con-
tinuum at the red part along with very strong Balmer
and He I/He II emission lines. Both the narrow and
broad emission components in the Balmer and He II lines
can be seen, and the strongest Balmer line is Hδ. C II
lines only show weak emissions. Deep Na I D absorption
line can be seen at 5895 ˚A. The strength of He II λ4686
is almost the same as Hβ, and C III is nearly absent.
The spectroscopic features are consistent with that of
the AM Her systems.

J0216 (Figure 10 on page 19) shows a relatively ﬂat
continuum with strong Balmer and He I/He II emission
lines. As the He II λ4686 emission line is stronger than
Hβ, and there are mutiple components or splits in the
Balmer lines, we classify it as a magnetic CV, possibly
of the AM Her type.

J0715 (Figure 10 on page 20) shows broad Balmer
emissions. The Hα emission line presents a ‘wine bot-
tle’ proﬁle. The He II λ4686 line is quite strong as the
strength is comparable to that of Hβ, and the C III/N III
blend also show strong emission. In view of the above
characteristics, we consider that it as a possible mag-
netic CV, speciﬁcally an IP.

5.1.4. Binary spectra

The spectra of J0523, J2250, J0535, J0628, J0356 and
J2045 present doninent cool companion star features on
the red part. For J2339 and J0311, both the companion
and the white dwarf features can be seen.

The spectrum of J0523 (Figure 10 on page 20) presents
strong narrow Balmer emission lines with weak decre-
ment to higher order. The spectrum shows prominent
M-type star features on the red part, and it can be ﬁt-
ted with a M2-type star. There is a signiﬁcant excess at
the blue part. The Balmer series present an asymmet-
ric broadening component superimposing on the strong
narrow emission. He I λ6678, λ5876, and λ4471 lines
are in emission, while He II lines are absent.

J2250 (Figure 10 on page 21) shows a continuum that
can be ﬁtted with a late K-type star, while presents
strong Balmer, He I and He II emission lines. The
Balmer lines have a broad component and show obvi-

ous asymmetric structure. The narrow Balmer emission
components show a decrement, while the broad compo-
nents do not show obvious decrement and shift to blue
with respect to the narrow components. We consider
that the narrow Balmer emission may come from chro-
mospheric activities of the companion star, while the
broad one come from an accretion disk or hot spot. In
addition, the deep Na I D λ5895 absorption line as well
as [O I] λ6302 and O I λ6365 absorption lines is visible.
J0356 (Figure 11 on page 22) has multiple spectra in
LAMOST DR6, and shows prominent variations. We
present two of the spectra of MJDs 56617 and 56684
in Figure 8. Both spectra show the M-type companion
features along with strong Balmer and He I/He II emis-
sion lines. Compared with the ﬁtted template spectrum,
the relative ﬂux of the LAMOST spectra has obvious
excesses at the blue part. In the lower panel of the ﬁg-
ure, the near-ultraviolet and near-infrared regions of the
spectrum of MJD 56684 are shown. In the observation
of MJD 56684, the Balmer series members higher than
Hα, He I and Ca II lines all show anti-P Cyg proﬁle,
which reveals the explosive nature of the object, while
He II λ4686 line appears to be a single emission or have a
P Cyg proﬁle. However, we can not completely rule out
the possibility that it is an explosive pre-main-sequence
object (like FU Orionis type stars) by the spectral fea-
tures alone.

The spectra of J0535 (Figure 10 on page 20), J0628
(Figure 11 on page 26) and J2045 (Figure 11 on page
26) all show features of a M-type companion. In those
spectra, the Balmer emission lines are quite narrow and
all show asymmetric features, and the Ca II H/K lines
are in strong emission. The Hβ is much weaker than Hα,
which is not typical for CVs. Moreover, J0535 shows He I
emission lines, while J0628 and J2045 show both He I
and He II emission lines. The Ca II triplets at 8500 ˚A
present slight emission in the former two but strong in
[O I] λ6302 also presents weak emission in all
J2045.
those spectra.

The spectrum of J2339 (Figure 11 on page 27) presents
both a M-type companion and a white dwarf features. In
the spectra, both Hα and Hβ show strong emission with
double-peaked proﬁles, and He I λ6678 presents weak
and broad emission, which may indicates that there is
an accretion disk.

J0311 (Figure 11 on page 22) has been classiﬁed as a
DA-type white dwarf by Zhang et al. (2013), and they
suggested it has unknown emission process. The spec-
trum presents strong Hα emission core and has strong
Balmer decrement for the emission components, while
the broad Balmer absorption resemble a white dwarf. It
also presents strong Ca II triplets but weak He I emis-

15

sion lines. As there are mutiple emission components in
the Balmer series and some are broad, we consider this
object may have a CV nature.

5.1.5. Other Objects

There are 21 spectra of J0621 in LAMOST DR6, and
15 of them show Hα emission features for which can be
identiﬁed as a possible CV candidate, as shown in Figure
11 on pages 24 and 25. The Hα emission lines in its
spectra present complex structure. There is a sharp ﬂux
increase at the blue end with emission features. Four
spectra of this object taken before MJD 58076 show very
wide absorption (the line width of Hα beyond 130 ˚A) of
Balmer and Paschen series, and the Na I absorption lines
are strong. Seven spectra taken at MJD 58076 and later
show an unusual double hump at 4000 ˚A - 5000 ˚A for
unknown reasons. As these spectra are taken at diﬀerent
dates, the double hump feature should be real rather
than instrumental problems.

J0534 is identiﬁed as a possible CV candidate due to
the broad Hα emission feature. It has three spectra in
LAMOST DR6 as shown in Figure 9. The spectrum
of MJD 56358 has a relatively low SNR, in which only
symmetrical Hα emission line can be seen. In the spec-
tra of MJDs 56981 and 57042, a late G- to early K-
type companion can be clearly seen. These two spec-
tra present a strong P Cyg proﬁles for Hα to Hγ and
Ca II triplets, which could indicate the presence of disk
winds or jets. However, in the spectrum of MJD 56981,
both the strength ratio of Sr II λ4077 to Fe I λ4046 and
the strength of C/N λ4215 band indicate that the K-
type star resembles a giant rather than a main-sequence
(Gray et al. 2009). The lack of He emission lines also
suggests that it may not be a CV. Follow up observations
are required to determine the nature of this object.

5.2. Poorly investigated objects

J0631 was investigated by Balanutsa et al. (2013) us-
ing the MASTER-Tunka auto-detection system. Based
on the blue color and photometric variability, it was
identiﬁed as a probable dwarf nova. It has also a UV
counterpart GALEX J0631. There are three spectra of
this object. Although the SNRs are low for all of them,
the DN properties can be found.
In the spectrum of
MJD 55861, the continuum reveals a high-temperature
component, and the emission features of the Balmer and
He lines are obvious. The Balmer core emissions are not
so broad and may have mutiple components, while the
week wide absorption can be seen for Hβ and higher
Balmer series members. Strong He II λ4686 emission
line also presents in the spectra. The above features are
in consistant with a dwarf nova during an outburst. For
the other two spectra of MJDs 55873 and 57096, the

16

continuum is quite ﬂat. They both present distinctive
asymmetric Balmer and He I λ6678 emission lines, while
He II λ4686 is absent in the two spectra. We thus con-
sider both spectra were taken at the quiescent phase of
a DN.

J0720 has been identiﬁed to be most likely a polar
with an extreme hot spot (Denisenko 2018), as it shows
a large amplitude of variation presenting in its light
curve with no eclipses found.
It has an X-ray coun-
terpart XMMSL2 J0720. There is only one spectrum
in LAMOST DR6, which shows sharp and asymmet-
ric Balmer emission lines with no obvious continuum.
He I λ4471, λ6678, and λ7065 emission lines also present
while He II λ4686 is absent. These spectral features are
consistent with those of a polar. However, the Hβ shows
a double-peaked proﬁle, which might imply the presence
of a residual disk.

6. CONCLUSION

Using the UMAP with k-NN method, we have spec-
troscopically identiﬁed 475 CV spectra of 323 objects
from LAMOST DR6, of which 52 objects are new. Af-
ter cross-match with the DR5 CV catalogue presented
by Hou et al. (2020), our results include 215 of their 224
objects in LAMOST DR6 v2. The other nine are not in-
cluded as their spectra don’t show obvious Hα-emission
features. This is due to the limitations of the current
UMAP method.

By visually examining the CV features of the spectra,
we can remove contamination of the Oe/Be stars and
H II regions, and identify more potential CV candidates
that are previously diﬃcult to single out. The new CVs
include ﬁve DNs during outbursts, ﬁve NLs and four
magnetic CVs (three of AM Her type and one of IP
type). We also discuss objects that directly show the
binary systems. In addition, we listed two objects that
have been poorly investigated from the known CVs in
our catalogue. Their spectral features conﬁrm the sub-
type they previously classiﬁed. Nevertheless, for J0720,

the Hβ presents an double-peaked proﬁle which may
suggest that there is a residual disk.

Our results show that the UMAP algorithm can iden-
tify CV spectra that present an core emission at Hα,
however, there are still shortcomings if the emission core
is weak, the program may not pick them out. More sam-
ples are needed for training of the UMAP method to
improve the classiﬁcation accuracy. Our results do not
include the AM CVn type, and the pre-polars which
may only show broad cyclotron emission lines, because
they both lack hydrogen lines. New methods should be
adopted to identify these two types of CVs as they may
not have any Hα emission lines.

In the future, we will carry out follow-up photometric
studies on the new CV candidates and poorly studied or
interesting CV objects, obtain the orbital parameters to
further study their properties.
