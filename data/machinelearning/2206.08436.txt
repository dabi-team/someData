Abstract—To address the challenges and exploit the opportu-
nities that the decarbonization of the energy sector is bringing
about, advanced distribution network management and operation
strategies are being developed. Many of these require accu-
rate network models to work effectively, including user phase
connectivity. However, such information is often not available.
This paper proposes a novel method to identify the phase
connectivity of single- and three-phase distribution consumers
using smart meter measurements. The method is based on
state estimation and mixed-integer linear programming, and
requires shorter measurement collection times compared to
statistical and machine learning-based techniques, for the same
level of accuracy. Consequently, the duration of measurement
efforts/campaigns aimed at obtaining this type of information
reduces, accelerating the system knowledge acquisition process
and potentially reducing the campaigns’ costs. A technique is
illustrated that allows to solve large networks in acceptable time
despite the considerable number of integer variables. Extensive
computational results are presented for publicly available low
voltage feeders.

I. INTRODUCTION

A. Background and Motivation

The increasing amount of distributed generation and the
electriﬁcation of transport and heating systems are changing
the nature of the distribution networks (DNs). These technolo-
gies can lead to technical issues, e.g., higher unbalance levels,
but also have the potential to, e.g., provide ﬂexibility for a
more active network management. To this respect, extensive
research has been conducted on, e.g., reactive power com-
pensation [1], PV curtailment [2], phase reconﬁguration [3],
and tap changer coordination [4]. The methods used in refer-
ences [1] - [4], as any other active distribution network method
that relies on power ﬂow equations, requires accurate network
data, including the phase connectivity of individual consumers.
However, the latter is typically unknown, especially at the low
voltage (LV) side [5]. As such, phase identiﬁcation (PI) is
crucial for the transition towards active distribution networks.

the fact that cables are not color-coded and often underground.
Devices exist that can inject distinctive signals and detect on
which phase they were generated [6], but these are excessively
expensive to be deployed on a large scale system. Phasor
measurement units (PMUs) have also been used to perform
PI [7], [8], but similar cost considerations apply. Smart meters
(SMs), on the other hand, are more economical and are already
being rolled out in DNs. Their use for PI has been extensively
investigated and, unless speciﬁed otherwise, the references in
the remainder of this section rely on SM measurements. One
of the earliest works addressing PI [9] consists of minimizing
the difference between the time series of transformer power
supply measurements and the total feeder demand per phase.
To do so, three binary variables are assigned to every user
(one per phase, indicating whether the user is connected to
that phase or not), resulting in a mixed-integer programming
(MIP) problem. Network losses are not modelled in [9], so the
method is only effective when these are very limited. Most
subsequent PI literature seems to refrain from MIP, possibly
due to scalability issues. In [10], principal component analysis
and graph theory are used to derive the network topology
from energy measurements. Ref. [11] and [12] use power
measurements from users and transformer, to which they apply
spectral analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator, respectively. Ref. [13] uses principal component
analysis and conservation of energy constraints. In [14], a
method is proposed that relies on hourly energy data and non-
linear Kalman ﬁlters. Relying on power/energy measurements
like [9]–[14] is convenient, as these are more often available
than voltage measurements, as they are also used for billing
purposes. However, these methods can lead to inaccurate PI
depending on the magnitude and pattern similarities of user
demand, particularly in networks with many users. Moreover,
multiple solutions may exist for methods that rely on the
conservation of energy, like [9], [13].

Using voltage time series is a popular alternative. Mul-
tiple researchers use them to classify users with k-means
clustering-based methods [15]–[19]. Alternatively, the voltage
time series correlation between the users and a reference,
either the transformer [20] or a three-phase connection [21],
can be calculated. Each user is subsequently assigned to the
reference’s phase to which it correlates the most. Ref. [22] pro-
poses a supervised machine learning approach, which however
requires an existing training data set. In general, voltage-based
methods are less accurate for short and balanced feeders [18].
Thorough comparisons of different statistical and clustering
methods for PI can be found in [23], [24].

 
 
 
 
 
 
PI can be performed stand-alone, or as part of network
topology identiﬁcation for unbalanced networks. This consists
of the data-driven reconstruction of the full network “tree”
e.g., using correlation methods [25], or graphical models and
conditional independence [26]. In this context, [8] proposes
a greedy algorithm which provides optimality guarantees and
solves in polynomial time. However, it requires PMUs and
diagonal dominance of the impedance matrix. Note that “topol-
ogy identiﬁcation” can also refer to the identiﬁcation of the
status of network switches, and may be part of state estimation
workﬂows, like in [27], but does not include PI.

Recently, a few papers re-introduced mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP) for PI. Wang et al. [28] propose a
maximum-likelihood-estimation approach with binary vari-
ables, but these are successively relaxed. Heidari et al. [29]
propose a MILP technique with linearized power ﬂow equa-
tions, which consists of minimizing the least absolute dif-
ference between measured values and system variables. This
is solved in their follow-up work [30] with an accelerated
Benders decomposition. Contrary to most (if not all) statistical
methods, MILP techniques are accurate in the presence of
power injection from PV, which alters voltage patterns making
correlation harder [30]. This seems an important advantage as
the number of PV installations is increasing. However, we
believe that the modelling, scalability and accuracy of the
existing MILP methods can be improved.

C. Contributions and Comparison with Other Methods

This work presents a novel method to perform PI in DNs,
starting from SM measurements. The method relies on state
estimation (SE) and MILP. The LinDist3Flow (LD3F) [31]
linearization of unbalanced power ﬂow equations is adopted.
To the authors’ knowledge, the ﬁrst paper that includes
full power ﬂow equations for MILP-PI is [29] (and its
follow-up [30]), and it is the state-of-the-art method which
is most similar to the one proposed in this paper. The use of
power ﬂow equations for PI exposes it to errors in the cable
impedance data, which may negatively affect the PI accuracy.
Nevertheless, numerical results show that the proposed method
is robust against this type of errors.

The approach presented in our paper is more general
than [29], [30], as it is based on proper SE rather than on the
difference between variables and measurements. This allows to
potentially include more measurement types and measurement
weights. The latter improves the convergence speed and the
ﬁltering of measurement noise. Moreover, [30] relies on the
linearization from [32], which assumes near-unitary voltage
magnitudes, coefﬁcient-based relations between power and
voltage, and results in non-convexities when applied to PI,
requiring additional approximations. The LD3F, on the other
hand, accurately approximates LV system behaviour for other
MILP problems, even in high-load conditions and sizeable
networks [33], and does not result in non-convexities for PI.
Furthermore, a formulation tightening technique is presented
in Section III-A, which is also novel.

The main contributions of this work are the following:
• A novel and effective MILP-SE-PI method is proposed,

2

together with a network decomposition technique that
allows the MILP to scale for feeders with many users.
• Considerations on PI of three-phase users are made, and

several approaches are implemented and compared.

Our network decomposition is similar to that in [29]. How-
ever, in [29], it had a negative impact on the PI accuracy, which
is not the case in the present work thanks to the underlying SE
structure and the implementation differences discussed before.

The proposed method presents a number of advantages,
even when line impedance errors are present, that stem from
the use of network equations. The main practical one is that
satisfactory PI accuracy is achieved with shorter measurement
time series in comparison to reference statistical methods. In
addition to accelerating the system information acquisition
process, this has the potential to reduce measurement cam-
paign costs for the system operator. The MILP-SE-PI works
with a combination of power and voltage measurements, which
can compensate the drawbacks of voltage- or power-exclusive
techniques. Furthermore, the method’s solution is the global
optimum of the MILP problem, whereas techniques like k-
means clustering can converge to local optima and it is often
harder to give a physical interpretation to their results [8].
Finally, the use of SE naturally enables to ﬁlter measurement
noise, reducing the impact of measurement errors on the PI.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
describes the mathematical model and implementation of the
proposed MILP-SE-PI, and Section III reports a series of tech-
niques that can be used to obtain faster solutions. Section IV
describes the case studies and shows numerical results. Finally,
Section V reports the main conclusions.

II. MATHEMATICAL MODEL

Let N and E be the set of a network’s nodes (buses) and
edges (branches), respectively. As any optimization problem,
the proposed MILP-SE-PI is made of a set of variables
and constraints, and an objective function. Let x and y be
continuous variables. x contains the power ﬂow variables
that belong to the LD3F formulation’s variable space, i.e.,
active and reactive power injections (pi, qi ∀i ∈ N ) and
ﬂows (pij, qij ∀ij ∈ E) and the squared voltage magnitude
ωi = |u|2
i ∀i ∈ N . y are auxiliary variables required for
the PI, as described later. Finally, δ are the problem’s integer
variables, which are all binary. Bold mathematical symbols
and letters represent vectors, if lowercase, and matrices, if
uppercase.

Let M be the set of available measurements, and let T
be the timesteps for which all measurements are collected,
i.e., T = {1, 2, ..., T }, where, e.g., for an hour of quarter-
hour measurements, T = 4. The MILP-SE-PI problem can be
summarized as:

invariant. In general, power terms relate as follows: s = p+jq,
with j =

−1, and p, q ∈ R3×1.

The generalized Ohm’s law for the LD3F formulation is

where

Aij = 2(Re(γ) · Rij + Im(γ) · Xij) ∀(ij) ∈ E,

Bij = 2(Re(γ) · Xij − Im(γ) · Rij) ∀(ij) ∈ E.

with α = e−j2/3π.

Eq. (3)-(5) are the fulcrum of the MILP-SE-PI, as they
contain the binary variables and relate them to the rest of
the problem. These equations can differ for single- and three-
phase users, and are introduced here for the former case ﬁrst.
Eq. (6) indicates any upper/lower bounds that can be applied
to the system variables. The better the a-priori knowledge of
the network and user behaviour, the tighter the bounds can be.

A. Single-phase Users

Fig. 1 illustrates the concept: single-phase connections are
modelled as three-phase, but to each phase φ ∈ Φ a binary
variable δi,φ is assigned that determines whether that phase is
actually the connected one (δi,φ = 1) or not (δi,φ = 0). The
following constraint enforces single-phase connectivity:

δi,φ = 1, ∀i ∈ U 1p,

(12)

(cid:88)

φ∈Φ

where U 1p is the set of single-phase users. Note that (12)
is part of (3) and is time-invariant: it is assumed that the
phase connectivity does not change during the measurement
collection period.

Every measurement m ∈ M refers to a certain quantity,
e.g., power injection. These quantities are part of the x
variables and can be divided in two categories:

1) node variables: ˘x,
2) edge variables: ˜x.

With the LD3F formulation, ˘x refers to ω and ˜x to p and
q, but should another formulation be used, ˘x generalizes to
any voltage measurements, e.g., magnitude, phasor, and ˜x to
any current or power measurements. The difference between
˘x and ˜x is that in non-connected phases, the latter can be
set to zero: there is no ﬂow/injection. Conversely, the voltage
variables of non-connected phases, cannot be set to zero. These
will actually take the same value as the respective phase in the
adjacent bus (i.e., the bus at the three-phase end of the service
cable), which is also a problem variable.

Let the measurements that refer to node and edge variables
be called “node measurements” and “edge measurements”, and
let their sets be ˘M, ˜M ⊂ M.

1) Single-phase Users - Node Measurements: Each mea-
surement m ∈ ˘M relates to a variable xm,t ∈ x, and is
described by the measurement value zm,t ∈ R, as reported
by the SM, and some conﬁdence on the quality of the
measurement, given by the SM speciﬁcations, σm ∈ R (this is
assumed time-invariant). Every user u ∈ U 1p is connected to a
bus i ∈ N and a mapping exists between measurement m and
bus i, so that these two indices can be used interchangeably.
For any node measurement, the following hold:

−ai,φ · (1 − δi,φ) ≤ ym,t − ˘xi,φ,t ≤ bi,φ · (1 − δi,φ),

∀m ∈ ˘M, φ ∈ Φ, t ∈ T : m → i ∈ N ,

ρm,t = f (ym,t), ∀m ∈ ˘M, t ∈ T .

(13)

(14)

Eq. (13) is part of (5) and ensures that if a user is connected
to a speciﬁc phase φ of a bus i, the corresponding node
variable ˘xi,φ,t equals the auxiliary variable ym,t. ai,φ, bi,φ ∈ R
are generic bounds and can be bus-, time- and/or phase-variant
or not. A practical assignment is ai,φ = bi,φ = ˘xi,φ, where
˘xi,φ is the variable’s upper bound.

Eq. (14) indicates that a residual deﬁnition is assigned to
every measurement, which is part of the objective (1). Contrary
to standard SE, where the residual would be a function of
˘xi,φ,t, here it is a function of the auxiliary variable ym,t ∈
y. The introduction of ym,t allows to only have one residual
equation per measurement, instead of three, and makes the
MILP more efﬁcient.

A residual describes some type of “distance” between a
variable’s most-likely value and its measured value. In SE, the

squares [34]. In this paper, to avoid non-linearities, weighted
least absolute values (WLAV) are used instead:

Constraint (20) is the three-phase equivalent of (13).

measurement is described by:

ρm,t = |ym,t − zm,t|/σm,

∀m ∈ M, t ∈ T ,

∀m ∈ ˘M, t ∈ T

∀m ∈ ˘M, t ∈ T .

(16)

(17)

Eq. (15) is part of (4).

2) Single Phase Users - Edge Measurements: Edge mea-
surements are described by the ˜x equivalent of (13)-(15) and
the following constraint:
˜xi,φ · δi,φ ≤ ˜xi,φ,t ≤ ˜xi,φ · δi,φ, ∀i ∈ ˜M, φ ∈ Φ, t ∈ T . (18)
if the user is not connected to φ,
Eq. (18) ensures that
the corresponding edge variable ˜xi,φ,t equals zero. If it is
connected, lower (˜xi,φ) and upper (˜xi,φ) bounds are given.
These can stem from knowledge on the user’s connected
capacity or other system information. As with all other bounds,
the better the system knowledge, the tighter they can be,
but the modeller should pay attention to not assign too tight
bounds that exclude optimal solutions.

B. Three-phase Users

Three techniques to model three-phase users are considered:
• Model A: Like three separate single-phase users, using

the equations presented so far,

• Model B: Like model A, but adding a constraint (19) to
enforce that each of the three resulting single-phase users
is connected to a different phase,

• Model C: a “connection mapping” that reduces the num-

Lastly, the following constraint ensures that the user is

C. Other Measurements

If other measurements are available, which are not associ-
ated to a user whose connectivity needs to be determined, such
as transformer measurements, these can be included in (1) in
a “normal” WLAV-SE fashion:

be applied to their measurements, too.

ber of binary variables.

D. Notes on Implementation and Measurement Choice

In Model B, for every three-phase user u that is “split” in
three single-phase users k, l, m, the following is added to (3):

(cid:88)

j∈{k,l,m}

δj,φ = 1 ∀φ ∈ Φ.

(19)

While the implementation of Model A and B is quite
straightforward, the total number of binary variables associated
to the three-phase user is 3 × 3 = 9: three for every separate
single-phase user. With Model C, these are reduced to 6, which
reduces the size of the branch-and-bound/cut search tree.

1) Model C - Node Measurements: Let each three-
phase user connected to bus i have a measurement vec-
tor ¯m ∈ R3 × 1, and let a mapping exists between ¯m and
bus i. There are six possible ways p ∈ ∆ of connecting a
three-phase user to a three-phase bus, each of which maps to
a speciﬁc permutation of the phase-sequence: p → ¯φ (Table I,
Fig. 2). The selection of a connection sequence p ∈ ∆ is
described by a binary variable δi,p. If sequence p is chosen,
δi,p = 1, else δi,p = 0. Any three-phase node measurement is
described by:

ρ ¯m,t = f (y ¯m,t), ∀ ¯m ∈ ˘M, t ∈ T ,
−ai,φ · (1 − δi,p) ≤ y ¯m,t − ˘xi, ¯φ,t ≤ bi,φ · (1 − δi,p),
∀ ¯m ∈ ˘M, p ∈ ∆, t ∈ T : ¯m → i ∈ N , δ → ¯φ.

(20)

The MILP-SE-PI is implemented in Julia/JuMP [35], and
relies on the PowerModelsDistribution.jl [36] and Power-
ModelsDistributionStateEstimation.jl [34] libraries. These are
ﬂexible toolboxes which make it relatively easy to choose
a different power ﬂow formulation or measurement types,
like phasors. In this paper, the measurements used are active
and reactive power and voltage magnitude, because they are
reasonably accessible to distribution system operators. Voltage

age (ω) variables in (13)-(20). Users can both be consuming
or injecting power from/to the grid.

In general, the proposed method is sound with any com-
bination of measurements as long as the underlying system
is overdetermined, i.e., “observable” from a SE standpoint.
Furthermore, the SE by design “ﬁlters” measurement noise,
reducing the impact of measurement errors on the PI process.

III. IMPROVING THE COMPUTATIONAL TIME

This section describes several techniques that have been
explored to achieve faster MILP solutions than with a “vanilla”
implementation of the model in Section II. Useful insights
have been found in paper [37]. Observing the MILP-SE-PI
response to these techniques gives interesting information on
the problem’s behaviour.

First of all, the underlying LP is prone to poor scaling, as it
is often the case for SE in DNs. Nevertheless, an attentive
choice of per-unit values and other coefﬁcients improved
the solve times without changing the results. Secondly, we
tested the MILP-SE-PI behaviour with different MIP starts,
in which increasing subsets of the users are assigned to
the correct phase. This did not result in meaningful speed
gains as the solver spends most time proving the optimality
of the solution rather than ﬁnding a good/the optimal one.
Some additional considerations on MIP starts are made in
Section IV-C. Furthermore, Benders decomposition (BD) was
tried, as this was also the technique of choice to solve the
MILP-PI in [30], although the decomposition is different due
to the different problem formulation. All constraints are time
dependent except (3). δ are so-called complicating variables,
and BD can be applied to a MILP with this structure.

However, as also observed in [30], BD alone does not
solve in acceptable time. In [30], this is tackled with a BD
acceleration technique. In this paper, a more reliable network
decomposition is applied to larger feeders instead. This is
discussed hereafter, together with a technique to tighten the
problem formulation.

A. Tightening the Formulation

The MILP formulation (1)-(6) can be tightened if informa-
tion on the overall user distribution per phase is available.
Then, the following can be added to (3):

N ≤

(cid:88)

i∈N

δi,φ ≤ N ∀φ ∈ Φ,

(26)

where N , N ∈ R are a maximum and minimum number of
expected user connections per phase. For instance, for a WYE-
connected feeder that has 10 users and non-zero power mea-
surements in all the transformer’s phases, N = 8, N = 1
can be safely assumed. Better/tighter values can be guessed by
examining the measurement data prior to starting the MILP,
and have a positive impact on the computational time.

5

B. Network Decomposition

The vast majority of the distribution systems are operated
radially. As such, feeders are tree (or chain) graphs and
they can be divided in sub-parts, as illustrated in Fig. 3
for the IEEE European Low Voltage Test Feeder. PI can be
performed for Sub-part A and Sub-part B ﬁrst, and then these
are re-united to Sub-part C in the form of equivalent three-
phase users. The equivalent users have three-phase voltage
magnitude measurements, relative to the bus where they are
connected to Sub-part C, and three-phase active and reactive
power measurements that correspond to the total injection to
that node, which is inherently calculated by the SE once the
phases of the sub-part are identiﬁed. A similar decomposition
was adopted in [29], but was detrimental to the PI accuracy.
The main reason why this decomposition is effective in the
present work is that SE is used, and from a SE standpoint
Sub-parts A and B are observable.

IV. CASE STUDIES

A. Description

The case studies are inspired from those in [30] as, to
the best of the authors’ knowledge, [30] is the only other
reference that addresses PI by modelling the feeders with
power ﬂow equations. As such, our method shares with [30]
the susceptibility to errors in the underlying network model,
addressed in this section. However, a rigorous comparison
between [30] and the presented results is not possible, as the
user demand/generation proﬁles are different (whereas the test
feeders are the same). For benchmarking purposes, researchers
could beneﬁt from a structured library with both network and
proﬁle data, similar to that for optimal power ﬂow [38], but
at the moment this does not seem to exist for PI.

Network and proﬁle data are taken from the ENWL
database [39], from which network 1, feeder 1 (i.e. the IEEE
European LV Test Feeder) and network 5 feeder 4 are chosen.
These have, respectively, 55 and 30 single-phase users, and
906 and 457 buses. The number of buses has been reduced to
118 and 65, respectively, with the method described in [40].
The networks after this pre-processing step are electrically
equivalent to the original ones, no approximations or infor-
mation losses are introduced. Furthermore, network 4 feeder
5 is used to compare different three-phase user models.

The proﬁle data from [39] have 5-minute resolution. To
create “synthetic” measurements, power ﬂow calculations are
run with the 5 min proﬁle data, and then Gaussian errors are
added to both the original proﬁles and the voltage magnitudes
resulting from the power ﬂow. Then, the average measurement
values of three adjacent timesteps are taken, to simulate 15
min measurements. This is currently the default resolution of
several commercial SMs [41].

The measured values zm appear in (1), while σm are the
standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution used to create
the errors, and correspond to a third of the maximum measure-
ment error given by the SM class. The following maximum
SM errors are considered: 0.5%, 1%, 5%. Furthermore, to
simulate inaccurate network data, errors are also added to

50%, as in [30]. It is assumed that every user has a SM with
15 min average voltage magnitude and average active and
reactive power measurements, and that the same measurements
are available at the LV side of the transformer as well. In
the authors’ experience, such a set-up is reasonable in the
ﬁeld. As mentioned before, the proposed method is based on
SE and would work with any measurement combination, as
long as the system is observable. This means that transformer
measurements, if unavailable, are not necessary if there are
enough SMs. However, without a reference measurement for
the feeder head, users would be assigned to different phases,
but it would be impossible to assess how these phases relate to
the transformer’s, leaving the network data incomplete. This
applies to any PI method, not only the proposed MILP-SE-PI.
For underdetermined systems, other methods than the pro-
posed one might be preferable. In particular, voltage-based
methods exist that can determine the connectivity of a few
SMs when most of the system is not monitored [24]. However,
PI cannot be performed for non-monitored connections, so a
full picture of the system cannot be obtained, which has a
negative impact on any calculation reliant on network data.

The results of the proposed method are compared to those
of two techniques from the literature: Pearson correlation and
linear regression. These methods are not affected by errors
in the network impedances, and are also used as a benchmark
in [30]. The ﬁrst relies on voltage measurements only: Pearson
correlation is calculated between the voltage measurement
time series of each user and each transformer phase [20], [24].
The user is then assigned to the transformer phase with the
highest correlation. The linear regression method additionally
uses active power measurements, as in [18].

The next part of this section shows the PI accuracy of the
three methods and the computational time of the proposed
MILP-SE-PI. The accuracy is deﬁned as the percentage of
users for which the phase connectivity is correctly identiﬁed.
Computational times of Pearson correlation and linear regres-
sion are not shown as both are negligible compared to the
MILP-SE-PI.

The calculations are performed on a 64-bit linux server with
Intel Xeon Platinum 8268 CPU @ 2.90GHz. Gurobi version
9.1 is accessed via Gurobi.jl and solves the MILP-SE-PI, with
the following parameters: “Threads” = 30, “Presparsify” = 1,
“Cuts” = 3,“MIP focus” = 3 [42]. All other parameters keep
their default values, which means that the MIP optimality

gap is 1e−4. The power ﬂow calculations to generate the
measurement data are run on an exact, non-convex power
ﬂow formulation and solved with Ipopt [43]. All the problem
bounds are set to be much larger than nominal values (e.g.,
˜xi,φ in (18) is 10 times the transformer nominal value), and
the tightening technique in III-A is not used. This avoids
strong assumptions on the network behaviour, which might
lead to longer solve times but circumvents the risk of erroneous
results, and simulates a case in which the modeller has very
limited system information.

B. Numerical Results: 30 Single-phase User Feeder

For this feeder, the decomposition method described in III-B
is not necessary. While we do not have full data for other coun-
tries, it is interesting to mention that about 84% of Flemish
feeders have fewer than 30 users, and as such can reasonably
be expected to be solved for with the MILP-SE-PI method
without the decomposition step. All the percentage values in
the presented tables are average values over 10 calculations
with 10 different random error assignments, unless stated
otherwise. For this feeder, results are reported in Table II. It
can be shown that for the lower SM errors, 100% accuracy
is achieved with very limited time series data. This suggests
that the LD3F does not introduce signiﬁcant modelling errors,
which was expected given the encouraging results in [33].
Furthermore, the results indicate that impedance errors do not
jeopardize the accuracy of the method, whereas more than
10 measurement time steps are required to compensate for the
noise introduced by larger SM errors (5%). The accuracy of the
MILP-SE-PI outperforms that of the benchmarking methods.
The computational time required to solve the MILP-SE-PI
can be seen in Fig. 4. Except for the case of 5% SM errors
with 5 time steps, the general trend is that longer measurement
time series require longer solve times, and increasing SM
errors also appear challenging for the solver, and lead to
extra computational efforts. On the other hand, increasing
impedance errors do not imply increasing computational effort.
54% of the overall instances solve in less than 15 minutes, and
91% in less than one hour. Note that the extra measurement
acquisition time required by the other methods to obtain com-
parable accuracies highly exceeds the MILP-SE-PI solve time.
For example, in the 0.5% SM error case, Pearson correlation
requires 50 time steps to achieve 90% accuracy, while 5 time

Sub-partASub-partBSub-partCEq.Three-ph.AEq.Three-ph.Bsteps are sufﬁcient with the MILP-SE-PI. The difference of
45 quarter-hour measurement time steps translates to 11.25 h.

C. European LV Feeder - Without Decomposition

In this section, results for the European LV Feeder are
presented, which are summarized in Table III. These results
refer to calculations with no error on impedance data and only
for the case of 1% SM error. The reason for addressing only
this case is that, without the decomposition in Section III-B,
calculating a single PI instance for this feeder exceeds the cut-
off limit of 2.5 hours imposed to the solver. As such, repeating
the numerical exercise for all the cases of Section IV-B would
take excessively long. Nevertheless, it is worth reporting that,
even though the solver does not explore the whole search tree
in the allowed solve time, the MILP-SE-PI still outperforms
the other methods’ accuracy (see Table III). Cutting off before
the end of the solving process implies that the optimality of
the current best MILP solution is not proven, but this is also
the case for any other heuristic or statistical method. As a
matter of fact, since branch-and-bound/cut gradually improves
on the previous found solution, a possible approach could
be to ﬁrst calculate a quick solution with a fast method,
and provide that as a MIP start to improve on for a given
calculation time. Finally, in real-life, the calculations would
only need to be performed once, so the cut-off time could
be increased signiﬁcantly, possibly solving in acceptable time
also for feeders of this size.

Section IV-E contains complete numerical results for the
decomposed European LV Feeder. Since the decomposition

requires modelling three-phase (equivalent) users, the next
section ﬁrst presents some numerical considerations on these.

D. Three-phase Users

This analysis is performed on Network 4, Feeder 5 of
the ENWL database, which originally has 20 users. The
following groups of single-phase users are aggregated into
three-phase users: (“8”, “17”, “10”), (“2”, “6”, “16”), and
(“19”, “9”, “15”). This is a realistic test case, as many
European feeders only have limited three-phase connections.
Fig. 5 illustrates the computational time for the different three-
phase user models described in Section II. The results refer
to 6 random combinations of SM errors and the following
number of timeseries lengths: 5, 10, 20. Impedance errors are
not considered. It can be observed that the most performant
model is, in general, model B. It is not surprising that model
B performs better than model A, as constraint (19) implies
that the former has a smaller search space. However, it is
more surprising that model B is also better than model C,
as the latter has fewer binary variables. Nevertheless, it is

not unprecedented that equivalent formulations with more
binary variables perform better [37]. Here, the comparison
between the methods is empirical. Deriving theoretical insights
to explain these numerical differences is beyond the scope of
the paper.

E. European LV Feeder - With Decomposition

The European LV Test Feeder is subdivided in three parts,
as shown in Fig. 3, and the equivalent three-phase users are
included with model “B”, since this was the faster to solve
in the previous experiments. Sub-part A has 23 users (69
binaries), sub-part B has 13 users (39 binaries), and sub-
part C has 19 single-phase users (57 binaries). In practice,
sub-part C is solved after the addition of the 2 three-phase
equivalent users of the other sub-parts (75 binaries). The
accuracy results are reported in Table IV. Overall, the accuracy
is slightly lower than in the 30-user feeder case, which is
reasonable as the system is bigger, more complex and with
more users, but the general conclusions remain the same. Such
a decrease in accuracy on the larger feeder has also been
observed in [30]. As before, the accuracy of the MILP-SE-PI
outperforms the other methods for the same measurement time
series length, and impedance errors seem to have little impact
on the accuracy, whereas SM errors have a bigger inﬂuence.
Table IV shows results for 60 time steps that are worse than
those for 40 time steps. While counter-intuitive, it is possible
that in some instances the extra time steps carry errors that
compromise the model rather than compensate for them with
more information. A more informed choice or ﬁltering of the
measurement time steps used for the analysis could lead to
more conﬁdence on the accuracy results and is an interesting
topic for future research work. With a 5% SM error, the PI
accuracy is never 100%, as some of the 10 random instances
fail to achieve 100%. This last problem could also be solved
with a better choice of measurement time steps, but, in any
case, SM accuracy is usually subject to government regulation,
as the readings are used for billing purposes. As such, their
accuracy is typically in the class of 0.5% [44], and the 5%
case is more illustrative than likely.

Fig. 6 shows the computational time required to solve the
European LV Feeder. This is the sum of the solve time of sub-
part A, sub-part B and sub-part C with the equivalent three-
phase users. While they are solved sequentially here, sub-part
A and B could be solved in parallel, reducing the total time.
Unsurprisingly, the solve times are longer than for the 30-user
feeder. However, 24% of the overall instances solve in less

than 15 minutes, and 88% in less than one hour, and even the
slowest instance calculates again in shorter time than the extra
measurement acquisition time that would be required for the
other two methods to achieve the same accuracy. As with the
other feeder, larger SM errors imply longer solve times.

F. Summary and Notes on the MILP-SE-PI Application

To conclude, the MILP-SE-PI is more accurate than the
reference methods, in all scenarios. The scalability of MILP
problems is a legitimate concern, and has been thoroughly
addressed in this work. The MILP-SE-PI solves in short time,
especially if combined with the network decomposition. Note
that a large amount of simulations has been performed for
this paper, whereas in real-life only one would be required
per feeder, making time constraints less stringent.

While the MILP-SE-PI has proved very successful in the
context of this paper, the authors believe that there is no
absolute best PI method. The MILP-SE-PI particularly stands
out in DNs that are fully observable from a SE standpoint,
for short time. This can occur where SM are widespread,
but are not set to log and communicate all measurements by
default, and can be activated to do so for some time, with extra
costs. In the authors’ experience, this or similar scenarios are
realistic, at least in Europe. However, despite the increasing
SM installations, partially observable systems may still be
present in the near future, and other methods may be preferable
to the MILP-SE-PI. A nice feature of the MILP-SE-PI is that
it can also be combined with other method, e.g., ﬁxing binary
variable values where correlations are high.

In general, as the characteristics of DNs vary highly over
time and location, we believe that the access to multiple PI
methods is probably necessary in the practice.

V. CONCLUSIONS

This paper presents a novel and scalable phase identiﬁcation
method based on state estimation and mixed-integer linear
programming. The method allows to accurately identify user
connectivity based on smart meter measurements only. Several
ways to model three-phase users are presented and compared,
which, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, is an original
contribution. The use of state estimation ﬁlters random noise,
making the method less sensitive to measurement errors.
The method is demonstrated on a set of publicly available
networks and user proﬁles, with different smart meter and
cable impedance error conditions. The method can work
with different measurement setups, as long as the system is
observable from a state estimation standpoint. Although only
demonstrated on low voltage feeders, where phase identiﬁca-
tion is most typically performed, the method is also applicable
to the medium voltage grid. The proposed method has been
compared to other techniques from the literature, and has
shown a higher accuracy with shorter measurement acquisition
times. This has the potential to perform phase identiﬁcation
on more feeders more quickly, accelerating the creation of
detailed network models that can beneﬁt the energy transition.
