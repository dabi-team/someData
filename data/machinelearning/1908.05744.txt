 Abstract—In  this  paper  a  neural  network  heuristic  dynamic 
programing  (HDP)  is  used  for  optimal  control  of  the  virtual 
inertia-based control of grid connected three-phase inverters. It is 
shown  that  the  conventional  virtual  inertia  controllers  are  not 
suited for non-inductive grids. A neural network–based controller 
is  proposed  to  adapt  to  any  impedance  angle.  Applying  an 
adaptive dynamic programming controller instead of a supervised 
controlled method enables the system to adjust itself to different 
conditions. The proposed HDP consists of two subnetworks: critic 
network  and  action  network.  These  networks  can  be  trained 
during the same training cycle to decrease the training time. The 
simulation results confirm that the proposed neural network HDP 
controller performs better than the traditional direct-fed voltage 
an/or reactive power controllers in virtual inertia control schemes.

INTRODUCTION 

Thanks  to  the  growing  demand  for  more  sustainable 
generation, distributed energy resources (RESs) are replacing 
the traditional generations. Consequently, utilization of inertia-
less  power  electronic  inverters  has  led  to  a  dramatic  fall  in 
system inertia especially in islanded microgrids. The reason is 
that RESs, such as photovoltaics (PVs) and wind turbines, are 
tied to the grid using fast-response power electronic converters, 
which do not have any inertia. The stability of the system and 
the voltage and frequency fluctuation increase by the decrease 
in  system  inertia,  which  is  the  result  of  the  increasing  RES 
penetration [1]. 

To  cope  with  this  concern,  several  solutions  have  been 
proposed.  Considering  the  fact  that  power  system  inertia  is 
essentially  provided  by  the  large  kinetic  energy  buffered  in 
synchronous  generators,  the  concept  of  virtual  synchronous 
generator/machine  (VSG/VSM)  was  introduced  recently  to 
virtually  imitate  the  response  of  the  traditional  synchronous 
generators  virtually  to  interact  with  the  power  system  to 
improve  system  inertia,  resiliency,  microgrid  stability,  and 
output impedance [2]-[4]. To improve frequency stability and 
solve  the  control  problem  of  microgrid  frequency,  several 
control  methods  have  been  applied  to  control  VSGs.  A 
traditional proportional controller (PI) has been used for virtual 
inertia control and its application in wind power [5]. However, 
recent  studies  show  that  these  controllers  have  inferior 

performance in particular when facing uncertainties concerning 
the angle of grid’s impedance [some references that have used 
other controllers].

Neural  networks  are  used  in  many  areas  such  as  image 
processing,  speech  recognition,  text  mining  [6]  and  control 
field 
and 
approximate/adaptive dynamic programing (ADP) can be used 
for  optimal  control  problem. Combining  parametric  structure 
with incremental optimization forms a new class of ADP called 
adaptive critic design (ACD) that approximate the optimal cost 
[7]-[8].  Heuristic dynamic  programing  (HDP)  is  the  simplest 
form of ACDs and has been studied in different applications, 
such as vector control of a grid-connected converter [9], power 
system  stability  [10],  and  permanent  magnet  synchronous 
motor drive [11].  

The  main  contribution  of  this  paper  is  to  present  a  new 
method for developing a neural network-based HDP combined 
with  the  virtual  inertia  strategy  for  controlling  a  grid-tied 
inverter. First, a brief review of virtual inertia control concept, 
frequency  control,  and 
limitation  associated  with 
conventional control for VSGs is presented in Section II. The 
heuristic dynamic programming concept, its subnetworks, and 
the implementation process in VSGs are explained in Section 
III. Lastly, the performance of the proposed HDP controller is 
evaluated in Section IV.

II.  PRINCIPLE AND MODEL OF A VSG 

In this section, the VSGs controller structure and the power 
flow  equation  are  explained.  Moreover,  it  is  shown  that  the 
virtual  inertia  controller  performance  extremely  depends  on 
the grid parameters. 
A.  VSG controller 

The control block diagram of the VSG system is illustrated 
in  Figure.  1.  In  this  paper,  it  is  assumed  that  the  inverter  is 
connected to a regular dc source. Hence, the inverter can route 
power from the dc source to inject additional power to the grid 
during 
to  solar  photovoltaic 
inverters).  The  control  scheme  in  Figure.  1  is  based  on  the 
 are 
virtual inertia method. In this model,

Figure 1. Conventional Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG) block diagram 

The most important component when modelling VSGs is the 
swing equation of a synchronous generator as follows: 

(a) 

(1) 

) + 𝐷∆𝜔 

𝑃𝑖𝑛 − 𝑃𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝐽𝜔𝑖 (

𝑑𝜔𝑖
𝑑𝑡
where  𝑃𝑖𝑛, 𝑃𝑜𝑢𝑡, 𝜔𝑖, 𝐽, and 𝐷 are the input power to VSG, 
the  electric  output  power,  the  angular  velocity  of  the  virtual 
rotor,  the  virtual  rotor  moment  of  inertia,  and  the  droop 
coefficient,  respectively.  In  this  equation, ∆𝜔  is  defined  by 
∆𝜔 =   𝜔𝑖 − 𝜔𝑔where 𝜔𝑔 is the grid angular velocity while the 
inverter  is  connected  to  the  grid  or  the  reference  angular 
velocity while the inverter works in a standalone mode.  

The  command  signal  to  the  inverter  includes  two  parts. 
First, it needs the RMS value of the inverter voltage or peak 
value  of  inverter  phase  voltage  (  𝐸  ).  Secondly,  it  needs  the 
inverter power angle with respect to the grid (𝛿). In order to 
compute  E,  the  electrical  output  power  can  be  computed  by 
measuring  the  inverter  voltage  signals  and  the  current  signal 
injected into the grid. Having all the necessary parameters in 
Equation (1), ∆𝜔 can be computed at each control cycle.  Then, 
the  mechanical  phase  can  be  calculated  by  integrating  this 
frequency. 

𝛿 = ∫ ∆𝜔 ∙ 𝑑𝑡 

In high voltage power systems, in order to tune the inverter 
voltage the reactive power controller with a voltage droop is 
applied. Applying a voltage droop and an integrator controller 
provides  the  RMS/peak  value  of  the  voltage  using  the 
following equation: 

𝐸 =

1
𝐾𝑖

∫ ∆𝑄 ∙ 𝑑𝑡 − 𝐷𝑣∆𝑉 

where  𝐾𝑖 and 𝐷𝑣 are the integrator coefficient and the voltage 
droop, respectively. The inverter reactive power tracking error 
is given by ∆𝑄 = 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑓 − 𝑄𝑒 , and the inverter voltage tracking 
error is given by ∆𝑉 = 𝑉𝑟𝑒𝑓 − 𝑉𝑖. The reference reactive power 
for the inverter is set to 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑓 and the inverter output reactive 
power can be computed by a power meter block. The variable 
𝑉𝑖  is  the  inverter  output  voltage,  and  𝑉𝑟𝑒𝑓  is  the  reference 
voltage for the inverter. Figure. 2 shows the active and reactive 
power controller block diagrams.

The proposed VSG average model can be derived based on 
a voltage source as shown in Figure. 3. In the figure, 𝑋𝑒𝑞is the 
equivalent  reactance  per  phase  (line  and  filter)  and  can  be 
computed  as  𝑋𝑒𝑞 = 𝑋𝐹 + 𝑋𝐿    , 𝑅𝑒𝑞  presents  the  equivalent 
resistance  per  phase  (line  and  filter)  given  as 𝑅𝑒𝑞 = 𝑅𝐿,  and 
𝑍𝑒𝑞  is  the  equivalent  impedance  per  phase  (line  and  filter) 
given  as 𝑍𝑒𝑞 = 𝑗𝑋𝑒𝑞 + 𝑅𝑒𝑞.  The  active  and  reactive  power 
delivered by the converter to the grid can be expressed as

where 𝑃 and 𝑄 are the delivered active and reactive power (per 
phas), V is the peak value of the phase voltage of the grid, E is 
the peak value of the output voltage of the inverter and 𝛿 is the 
phase angle between the grid voltage and the inverter voltage. 
For an inductive equivalent impedance (i.e. 𝑋𝑒𝑞 ≫ 𝑅𝑒𝑞 as in 
[12], [13],) the active and reactive power can be estimated as:

Equation  (4)  and  (5)  clarify  that  in  inductive  grids,  the 
active power is proportional to the power angle and the reactive 
power is proportional to the inverter voltage. In this case, the 
conventional  VSG  controller  performance  is  acceptable; 
nonetheless,  in  low-voltage  grids  that  are  mostly  resistive  or 
semi-resistive,  this  assumption  is  no  longer  valid.  In  other 
words,  Q  depends  on  both  the  power  angle  and  the  voltage 
magnitude.  In  order  to  turn  the  reactive  power  controller  for 
non-inductive  grids,  all  the  parameters  of  the  system  model 
need to be known to make it possible to design an acceptable 
reactive power controller. However, in the power system, the 
inverter  might  face  uncertainties  such  as  line  impedance 
changes or nonlinear behaviors (e.g. transformer saturation) in 
electrical element that alter the reactive power equation. In this 
paper, an adaptive dynamic controller, capable of adjusting its 
parameter, is used to find the optimal solution and the results 
are compared with the conventional controller performance. 

III.  HEURISTIC DYNAMIC PROGRAMING  

The  integral/proportional  integral  controller  for  virtual 
inertia is limited in terms of the following characteristics. First, 
the  integrator  (and  the  proportional)  parameters  need  to  be 
tuned  online  based  on  the  system  response  or  the  designer 
experience.  In  addition,  the  conventional  controllers  such  as 
integral  controller or proportional controller  are designed  for 
linear  systems,  and  it  cannot  perform  well  in  non-linear 
systems. In order to tune the coefficients, the linearized model 
is used. Hence, when the operating point changes, the system 
model will change and the PI parameters are no longer optimal. 
Finally,  the  proposed  proportional  integral  controller  is  a 
single-input single-output (SISO) system; however, for the case 
of a non-inductive grid, both active and reactive error signals 
are  needed  as  the  voltage  controller  input.  The  proposed 
controller  in  this  paper  is  based  on  a  direct  action  heuristic 
dynamic  programing  scheme  to  address  the  aforementioned 
issues. 

Adaptive critic designs are neuro control (neural network–
based controller) designs that are suitable for optimal control 
over  time  under  conditions  of  uncertainty  and  noise.  [14] 
proposed  ACDs  as  a  new  optimization  method  inspired  by 
approximate dynamic programing and reinforcement learning. 

Most  important  ACDs  can  be  listed  as  follows:  heuristic 
dynamic programing (HDP), dual heuristic programing (DHP), 
global heuristic dynamic programing (GHDP), and global dual 
heuristic  programing  (GDHP).  Typical  ACDs  consist  of  two 
subnetworks:  the  action  neural  network  and  the  critic  neural 
network. The main difference between the types of ACDs can 
be defined in the networks output signal and the error feedback 
signal. 

Figure. 4.  Heuristic dynamic programing block diagram 

HDP can be introduced as the most straightforward form of 
ADCs. The design scheme of HDP is illustrated in Figure. 4. In 
HDP,  the  critic  networks  learn  to  approximate  the  strategic 
utility or the cost-to-go function, which in dynamic programing 
is  defined  as  the  Bellman’s  equation  function.  The  action 
network generates the control signal and feeds it to the system 
and to the critic network. The state vector and the control signal 
feed the critic network when its goal is to estimate the cost-to-
go  function.  In  Figure.  4,  the  dashed  lines  provide  the 
corresponding  error  signal  for  the  learning  procedure  of  the 
action and the critic neural network. 
A.  Critic neural network  

The  cost-to-go  J  function  of  dynamic  programing  in 

Bellman’s equation is as follows 

∞

𝐽(𝑘) = ∑ 𝛾𝑖𝑈(𝑘 + 1)

𝑘=0

where 𝛾 is a discount factor, (0 < 𝛾 < 1 ), to make sure that 
the  cost  to  go  is  bounded,  and  𝑈  is  the  utility  function.  The 
utility function in this paper is defined as 

𝑈(𝑘) = √𝐾𝑃𝑒𝑃

2 + 𝐾𝑄𝑒𝑄

where  𝑒𝑃, 𝑒𝑄, 𝑒𝑓 are the error signal fo active power, reactive 
power, and frequency respectively defined as: 

𝑒𝑃 = 𝑃𝑠𝑒𝑡 − 𝑃 
𝑒𝑄 = 𝑄𝑠𝑒𝑡 − 𝑄 
𝑒𝑓 = 𝑓𝑔 − 𝑓

and 𝐾𝑃,  𝐾𝑄, 𝐾𝑓  are  the  active  power  coefficient,  the  reactive 
power coefficient, and the frequency coefficient, respectively. 
These coefficients can also be defined as the weight matrix in 
a  normalized  function  to define  the importance of  each  error 
signal. Figure. 5 illustrates the critic network, which is a fully 
connected  multi-layer  forward  network,  consisting  of  two 
hidden layers with eight nodes. The input to the neural network 
is a vector consisting of the inverter active and reactive power, 
the active power error, the reactive power error, the frequency 
error, the inverter phase angle, and the action network output. 
The critic neural network input vector can be expressed as 

𝐼𝑁{𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐 𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘} = [𝑃 𝑄 𝑒𝑝 𝑒𝑞 𝑒𝑓  𝜃𝑖 𝐸]. 

Due  to  the  real-time  operation  of  the  system,  the  critic 
neural network is trained forward in time to minimize the error 
signal measured over time, which is defined in a way that the 
difference between two successive cost-to-go function and the 
utility function is minimum. In other words, to minimize 

∑[𝐽(𝑘) − 𝛾𝐽(𝑘 + 1) − 𝑈(𝑘)]2.

Applying the gradient decent, the weights can be updated 

as follows 

𝑊𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐(𝑘 + 1) = 𝑊𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐(𝑘) + ∆𝑊𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐 

∆𝑊𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐 = 𝛼𝑐[𝐽(𝑘) − 𝛾𝐽(𝑘 + 1) − 𝑈(𝑘)]

where  𝑊𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐  is  the  critic  network  weight  and  𝛼𝑐  is  the 
learning rate. 
B.  Action neural network  

 The goal of action neural network is to generate the control 
signal  to  minimize  the  cost-to-go  function  for  the  immediate 
future. In other words, the objective is to minimize the sum of 
the utility function over the specific horizon, which is defined 
in  this  project  as  one  second.  (1000 𝑚𝑠).  The  implemented 
action neural network is similar to that of critic network, a fully 
connected  multi-layer  feedforward  neural  network  with  two 
hidden layers, each with eight nodes, and one output. The input 
signal to this network is similar to the input of the critic neural 
network except it does not include the control signal. The action 
network input vector can be written as follows: 

𝐼𝑁{𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘} = [𝑃 𝑄 𝑒𝑝 𝑒𝑞 𝑒𝑓  𝜃𝑖]. 

where    𝐼𝑁{𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘}  is  the  input  vector  to  the  proposed 
action neural network. The output signal of the action network 
is the peak value of the output voltage of the inverter(𝐸(𝑘)). In 
order 
the 
in 
backpropagation  algorithm  is  used.  The  objective  is  to

IV.  PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THE TRAINED HDP 
VIRTUAL INERTIA–BASED CONTROLLER 

Figure. 6 illustrates the block diagram of the proposed HDP 
VSG  controller.  As  shown,  in  the  proposed  controller  the 
conventional  PI  controller  is  replaced  with  the  HDP  neural 
network controller. In favor of generating the proper input to 
the neural networks, a block named “network input generator” 
is  implemented  and  by  feeding  the  raw  data  to  this  block,  it 
generates the compatible input vector.   

In  order  to  train  the  neural  network  the  following  steps 

should be followed. 

1.  A random vector for the initial states is generated 
2.  A random setting for the active and the reactive power 

is set. 

3.  The  neural  networks  weights  were 

initialized 

randomly. 

4.  Weights continued to be updated for the horizon of 1 

sec. 

This  simulation  analyzes  the  performance  of  the  proposed 
controller  in  both  inductive  and  resistive  grids.  The  system 
parameters are listed in Table I. 

A.  Inductive grid 

Figure.  7  illustrates  the  comparison  between  the  HDP

acceptable  because  the  delivered  active  power  and  reactive 
power  are  proportional  to  the  inverter  phase  angle  and  the

relatively similar active power overshoot for both HDP and PI 
controller, the HDP controller tends to reach steady state faster.

and  the  conventional  PI  controller  in  the  resistive  grid.  It  is 
discussed  in  Section  Ⅱ  that  the  assumption  that  reactive  and 
active power are proportional to the inverter voltage magnitude 
and  phase  angle,  respectively,  is  no  longer  valid  in  resistive 
grids.  Consequently,  the  conventional  controller,  which  uses

V.  CONCLUSION 

Three-phase  inverters  are  widely  implemented  to  connect 
RESs to the grid. Currently, these inverters are controlled with 
conventional PIs, which have several drawbacks such as lack 
of the ability to work in standalone mode and stability issues. 
To  overcome  these  disadvantages,  the  VSG  concept  has 
emerged. The VSG control scheme is challenging, especially in 
non-inductive grids. This paper presents the heuristic dynamic 
programming  controller  to  design  a  neural  network–based 
adaptive  controller  for  three-phase  VSGs  performing  in 
inductive and resistive grids. It was shown by simulation that a 
HDP  controller  with  well-trained  action  network  and  critic
