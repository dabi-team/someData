Abstract 
We model the problem of optimizing the schedule of courses a student at the American College 
of Greece will need to take to complete their studies. We model all constraints set forth by the 
institution and the department, so that we guarantee the validity of all produced schedules. 
We  formulate  several  different  objectives  to  optimize  in  the  resulting  schedule,  including 
fastest completion time, course difficulty balance, and so on, with a very important objective 
our model is capable of capturing being the maximization of the expected student GPA given 
their performance on passed courses using Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques. All 
resulting problems are Mixed Integer Linear Programming problems with a number of binary 
variables that is in the order of the maximum number of terms times the number of courses 
available for the student to take. The resulting Mathematical Programming problem is always 
solvable by the GUROBI solver in less than 10 seconds on a modern commercial off-the-self PC, 
whereas the manual process that was installed before used to take department heads that are 
designated as student advisors more than one hour of their time for every student and was 
resulting in sub-optimal schedules as measured by the objectives set forth. 

1. Introduction 
The  American  College  of  Greece  (ACG)  is  the  largest  American  private,  non-profit  higher-
education institute in Europe, originally founded in 1875 in Smyrna, and currently located in 
Athens,  Greece.  It  consists  of  three  major  divisions:  (a)  the  Pierce  College  for  secondary 
education, (b) the Deree College for undergraduate and graduate education, and (c) the ALBA 
graduate business school. The Deree College is accredited by the New England Commission of 
Higher  Education  (NECHE),  and  it  currently  enrolls  more  than  5,000  undergraduate  and 
graduate  students.  Deree  College  has  4  schools  (Business  &  Economics,  Liberal  Arts  & 
Sciences, Frances Rich School of Fine & Performing Arts, and the Graduate School of Arts & 
Sciences offering Master’s level degrees in applied psychology, communication, leadership, 
and data science.) In total, the Deree College has 15 departments, offering one or more majors 
each in their corresponding areas.  

Students enrolled at Deree College are encouraged, and do seek advice from their academic 
advisors in order to plan for their course of action while studying at Deree: during their first 
year of study, the students usually get advice from the student services office, and after that, 

 
 
they are directed to their major department. From that point on, the department head and/or 
program coordinator is their main source of advice regarding their planned course schedule 
for the remainder of their studies. This results in significant pressure to department heads, 
who, besides their normal teaching, scholarly and administrative duties, are also required to 
prepare  customized  course  schedules  for  every  student  who  chooses  their  department  as 
their major. Besides an initial interview with the student to decide on elective courses that 
the student would like to take, the department head or program coordinator must come up 
with  a  course  schedule  that  obeys  a  large  number  of  complex  constraints  (see  details  in 
section  2.3)  and  optimizes  a  number  of  objective  criteria  that  are  prioritized  according  to 
student wishes. Since manual optimization by hand for such a difficult problem is out-of-the-
question,  the  department  heads  usually  resort  to  predefined  templates  of  feasible  course 
schedules that they then tamper with until they agree with the student’s current status (what 
courses they have passed so far, their GPA etc.) and “look good enough” for the student.  

The process described above is a heuristic process that takes up a significant amount of time 
for the department head or program coordinator; it has been estimated that each student 
schedule  usually  takes  more  than  one  hour  of  intense  study  by  the  head/coordinator  to 
resolve, which translates to more than 50 hours of work per semester per head/coordinator 
for what is a pure scheduling optimization problem. Given that there are 15 departments at 
Deree College, this results in approximately 750 hours of intense human labor per semester, 
spent by faculty that are by default already high up in the hierarchy. 

Given the reasons above, we (all faculty at the Information Technology Department) took up 
the challenge of automating this process by offering students a program that when fed with 
current student data and desires, comes up with a feasible schedule obeying all the complex 
constraints in place for every department of Deree College, and at the same time optimizes a 
number  of  objectives  according  to  student  desires.  The  result  is  the  ACG  Student  Course 
Schedule  Optimizer  (SCORER),  a  small  (just  above  5,000  lines-of-code  in  Java)  desktop 
program. SCORER accepts as input the following: 

•  Student data (entered through the program GUI): 
o  The courses a student has already passed 
o  The desired courses the student wishes to take 
o  Student  choices  regarding  summer  courses,  maximum  desired  number  of 
courses  per  term,  and  maximum  desired  number  of  courses  to  take 
concurrently when undertaking their thesis (ICT Capstone project) 
o  The student’s priorities over the objectives implemented in the program 

•  Program data (read from input configuration files): 

o  Course  information  about  each  course  offered  by  the  college,  including 
course code, title, number of credits, prerequisite and corequisite constraints, 
terms when the course is offered in the future, course difficulty measured in 
a scale from 0 to 10 and so on 

o  Constraints regarding focus-areas within a major that can be complex subset-
selection constraints (“student must take 2 of the following 4, and another 2 
of the following 5” and so on) 

o  Other constraints information such as maximum number of credits allowed 
to  be  registered  for  in  a  semester,  maximum  number  of  semesters  before 
graduation etc. 

SCORER  creates  a  complex  Mixed-Integer  Linear  Program  (MILP)  (Wolsey  &  Nemhauser, 
1988),  (Christou  (2011),  chapter  1)  and  calls  GUROBI  (Gurobi,  2022a),  one  of  the  fastest 
commercial optimization solvers in existence today to solve it. Once GUROBI finds the optimal 
solution,  the  problem  translates  the  optimization  problem  variables  back  to  the  problem 
domain  variables,  and  displays  to  the  student  their  corresponding  schedule  of  courses  in 
human-readable format. An edit-area allows the user to change the term when they take any 
given  course  planned  for  them,  or  even  to  completely  reject  a  proposed  course  and  re-
optimize given the new user inputs. 

1.1. Related Work 
There is a large body of work on higher education curricular optimization, see for example  
(Thompson-Arjona 2019),  (Heileman et al, 2019), (Unal & Uysal, 2014) but not on the specific 
topic of computing individual student course plans. The M.Sc. thesis of Thompson-Arjona in 
particular,  considers  some  of  the  constraints  put  forth  by  course  pre-requisite  and  co-
requisites  but  only  in  the  context  of  designing  a  more  balanced  curriculum  for  Electrical 
Engineering programs that attempts to avoid “toxic course combinations” and bring courses 
as close as possible to their pre-requisites in terms of when they are offered. The work is not 
oriented  towards  optimizing  individual  student  plans.  Further,  the  pre-requisite  and  co-
requisite  constraints  formulated  in  the  thesis  only  apply  to  mandatory  courses  of  the 
curiculum, not to courses that might be elective courses. 

In  the  commercial  world,  the  Prepler  system  (www.prepler.com)  does  have  many  of  the 
features that SCORER has and of course has a lot more analytics/dashboard features, but does 
not explicitly state what the objectives of the produced degree plans are, or even whether it 
actually optimizes anything behind the scenes.  

There is also a rapidly growing body of software for course scheduling that allows students to 
create their  weekly  course  schedule  in  the  form of  calendar  applications  (see  for  example 
Comm and Mathaisel (1988) for an early discussion on class and calendar scheduling software 
requirements,  Miranda  (2010)  for  a  more  recent  study,  or  the  online  web-apps  at 
https://www.kalena.es,  https://www.roverd.com  or  https://www.ofcourse.org.)  All  these 
applications however are concerned with time-tabling of courses per semester, and not with 
the  long-term  planning  of courses  for  an  individual student  throughout  their  studies  at  an 
institution which is our current focus. 

In  the  rest  of  the  paper,  we  first  present  the  modeling  and  formulation  of  the  course 
scheduling problem at Deree College (section 2), in section 3 we present the  details of our 
program  implementation,  in  section  4  we  present  some  data  regarding  the  efficiencies 
achieved  by  the  adoption of  the  system  by  the “Information  Technology”  and  the  “Cyber-
security  and  Networks”  programs  of  the  IT  Department,  and  in  section  5  we  present  our 
conclusions and future directions for our work.  

2. Problem Formulation 
2.1 Problem Parameters 
Let {𝑐1, … 𝑐𝑁} denote the total number of courses available to a student, indexed by the set 
𝐶 = {1,2, … 𝑁}. Each course 𝑐𝑖 has an associated number of credits 𝑐̅𝑖 (often equal to 3, but 
many courses have different credit value, e.g. courses with labs usually have 4 credits.) We 
also associate a non-negative difficulty level 𝑑̅𝑖 ≥ 0 with each course 𝑐𝑖 that is estimated via 
the student failure rates in the past 3 years (for courses that have been taught all this time in 

the past) or via the average letter grade of the student cohorts of the past year (if the course 
has been taught at least once), or if the course has never been taught before, simply by the 
instructor’s “best guess”. The difficulty level is zero for an “average difficulty” course, and can 
rise to any positive value up to 10, for more difficult courses. The difficulty level of courses 
plays an important role in the way the optimal schedule is constructed since as we shall see it 
affects the objective function to optimize under any scenario. 

Returning to the set of courses, several important subsets of the set 𝐶 are as follows: 

•  𝐿𝐸 ⊂ 𝐶 is the set of all courses that count as “Liberal Education” courses that must 
be completed for any degree. A minimum of 𝐿𝑐 credits must be taken from liberal 
education  courses  for  a  degree  to  be  granted;  this  minimum  number  of  credits  is 
currently set to 43. 

•  𝑅𝑗 ⊂ 𝐶, 𝑗 = 1, … 𝑘 are sets of courses, from each of which a student must take at least 

a certain number of courses 𝑟𝑗 > 0. 

•  𝐿𝑖 ⊂ 𝐶, 𝑖 = 4,5,6 are so-called “Level-4”, “Level-5”, and “Level-6” courses that as we 

shall see impose certain restrictions on when a student can register for them. 

There is a minimum number of credits required for graduation, which is denoted by 𝑇𝑐 and 
which  is  currently  set  to 121.  There  is  also  a maximum  allowed  number of  credits  𝐶𝑚𝑎𝑥  a 
student  is  allowed  to  take  per  semester,  which  is  currently  set  to  17  cr  (which  is  further 
increased to 20 cr for honors students.) 

Students take courses each year of their studies, during various terms (semesters), which are 
divided in {Fall, Spring, Summer1, Summer2, SummerTerm} terms. Fall and Spring terms last 
13  weeks  each,  as  expected  (September  to  December,  and  January  to  April  respectively). 
Summer1 and Summer2 terms are fast-paced intense 4 week long terms that run during June 
and July respectively, while SummerTerm is a somewhat more relaxed term that lasts 8 weeks 
starting end of May and running until the last week of July.  

The  notion  of  “pre-requisite”  and  “co-requisite”  courses  is  based  on  the  order  by  which 
students  progress  through  their  studies,  and  the  knowledge  needed  by  more  advanced 
classes. Unfortunately, the natural order Fall →Spring → Summer1 → Summer2 breaks down 
when we consider the SummerTerm that runs concurrently with Summer1 and Summer2. To 
make things clear, if a course X is offered in the Fall semester and another course Y is offered 
in the Spring semester and lists X as a pre-requisite, then a student who successfully passed X 
in the Fall, may register for Y in the Spring semester. Similarly, if X is offered in the Spring and 
the student passes it, then if course Y is offered in Summer1 the student may register for Y in 
Summer1.  However, if X is offered in Summer1 and Y  is offered in SummerTerm, then  the 
student  cannot  register  for  course  X  in  Summer1  and  for  course  Y  in  SummerTerm 
(SummerTerm is not considered “after” Summer1 or Summer2). However, SummerTerm is 
still considered “after” the Spring semester. 

Given the above, we still impose the following order in the academic terms of any particular 
year, and we shall explain later on how we manage to enforce pre-requisite and co-requisite 
constraints on all courses scheduled for a student: 

Fall=1, Spring=2, Summer1=3, Summer2=4, SummerTerm=5. 

We  assume  there  is  a  maximum  term  number  that  a  student  may  register  as  an 
undergraduate, denoted by 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 which can be set to an arbitrarily large number, if desired, 

but which we set to 25 (5 terms per year, for a maximum allowed 5 years of study). A student 
does not have to register for courses in every such term: many students will only register for 
one or two courses for each of the Summer1 and/or Summer2 terms, but they will not register 
for any course offered in the SummerTerm term.  

Finally, courses are only available during certain terms. The parameters 𝑜𝑖,𝑠 take binary values 
to indicate whether course 𝑐𝑖 is offered in term 𝑠 ∈ {1, … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥} with 𝑜𝑖,𝑠 = 1 meaning that 
course 𝑐𝑖 is offered in term 𝑠. 

2.2 Problem Variables 
We find it most useful to consider the following variables in order to formulate our problem: 

•  𝑥𝑖 ∈ {0,1}, ∀𝑖 = 1, … 𝑁 is 1 if student takes (and passes) course 𝑐𝑖 and 0 otherwise 
•  𝑥𝑖,𝑠 ∈ {0,1} ∀𝑖 = 1, … 𝑁, 𝑠 = 0,1, … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 is 1 if student takes (and passes) course 𝑐𝑖 
in term 𝑠, and 0 otherwise. In particular, by 𝑥𝑖,0 = 1 we denote courses the student 
transfers from other institutions, and in any way, courses the student passes before 
their first registration at the college. It is easy to see that ∑
= 𝑥𝑖 and therefore 
the entire sum will be either 1 or 0 according to whether or not the student ever takes 
and passes course 𝑐𝑖. 

𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑠=0

𝑥𝑖,𝑠

•  𝐷 ∈ ℕ  denotes  the  last  term  number  the  student  registers  for  any  course  before 

graduation. Obviously, it holds that 𝐷 ≤ 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥. 

•  𝐷𝐿 ∈ ℕ  denotes  the  maximum  sum  of  difficulty  levels  of  courses  the  student  will 
encounter during any term. Obviously, any student would like this number to be kept 
as small as possible (so that they are not “overloaded” with difficult courses at any 
point during their studies). 

•  𝐺𝑒 ∈ ℕ denotes the maximum sum of estimated grades the student will accumulate 
when taking the courses in the proposed plan. Obviously, any student would like this 
number to be as high as possible, so as to maximize their GPA upon graduation. 

2.3 Problem Constraints 
The problem constraints are as follows: 

2.3.1 Pre-requisite and Co-requisite Constraints 
Consider the directed graph of pre-requisite courses: every course 𝑐𝑗 has a (possibly empty) 
list of course pre-requisites 𝑃𝑗 = {𝑘|𝑐𝑘 <   𝑐𝑗}, where the inequality “𝑐𝑘 <   𝑐𝑗" is interpreted 
as “course 𝑐𝑘 must be completed before student registers for course 𝑐𝑗”. These lists create 
the  graph  of  course  pre-requisites  𝐺(𝑉, 𝐸)  where  the  nodes  of  the  graph  are  the  courses 
themselves, and there is a (directed) edge (𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗) ∈ 𝐸 if and only iff 𝑖 ∈ 𝑃𝑗. 

Further,  consider  the  also  directed  graph  of  co-requisite  courses:  every  course  𝑐𝑗  has  a 
(possibly empty) list of course co-requisites 𝑄𝑗 = {𝑘|𝑐𝑘 ≤   𝑐𝑗}, where the inequality “𝑐𝑘 ≤   𝑐𝑗" 
is interpreted as “course 𝑐𝑘 must either be completed before student registers for course 𝑐𝑗 
or else be taken at the same term that student takes course 𝑐𝑗”. These lists create the graph 
of course pre-requisites 𝐺′(𝑉, 𝐸′) where the nodes of the graph are the courses themselves, 
and there is a (directed) edge (𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗) ∈ 𝐸′ if and only iff 𝑖 ∈ 𝑄𝑗. 

Given  the  above  definitions,  we  model  the  pre-requisite  constraints  for  the  scheduling  of 
courses as follows: 

𝑥𝑗,𝑠 ≤ ∑

𝑠−𝑘𝑠
𝑡=0

𝑥𝑖,𝑡

  ∀(𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗) ∈ 𝐸, 𝑠 = 1 … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑘𝑠 = {

3 𝑖𝑓 𝑠%5 == 0
1 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒                 

                                   (1) 

The meaning of the constraint is simple: 𝑥𝑗,𝑠 cannot be 1 unless student has taken course 𝑐𝑖 
at any term 𝑡 = 0,1, … 𝑠 − 𝑘𝑠 where 𝑘𝑠 = 1 if 𝑠 is a “normal” term, and 𝑘𝑠 = 3 if 𝑠 is a summer 
term, in which case, the student must have passed course 𝑐𝑖 at least by the previous Spring 
term. 

Extension to complex pre-requisite constraints 

At  ACG  (and  the  IT  Department  in  particular),  pre-requisite  constraints  can  be  a  lot  more 
complex  than  what  was  just  described  above.  There  are  courses  for  which  a  student  can 
register as long as they have completed one from a chosen set of other classes. As an example, 
for the course ITC4140 “Methods in ICT Project Research and Management”, the student can 
register  for  it  if  they  have  successfully  passed  the  course  MA2010  “Statistics  I”  OR  course 
MA2021  “Applied  Statistics  for  Business”  OR  MA2025  “Applied  Statistics  for  Science”  (all, 
collectively  known  as  “statistics  courses”).  In  general,  such  a  disjunctive  constraint  of 
prerequisite  courses  where  course  𝑐𝑖1, 𝑐𝑖2 𝑜𝑟 𝑐𝑖3  must  be  completed  before  registering  for 
course 𝑐𝑗 can be modeled via the following constraint: 

3
𝑥𝑗,𝑠 ≤ ∑
𝑚=1

∑

𝑠−𝑘𝑠
𝑡=0

𝑥𝑖𝑚,𝑡

   𝑠 = 1 … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑘𝑠 = {

3 𝑖𝑓 𝑠%5 == 0
1 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒                 

                                           (1’) 

Some  courses  however  have  even  more  complex  prerequisite  constraints:  course  ITC3287 
“Advanced  Object  Oriented  and  Functional  Programming”  lists  as  its  prerequisites  the 
following:  (1)  ITC2088  “Introduction  to  Programming,  and  (2)  ITC2197  “Object  Oriented 
Programming  Techniques”  OR  ITC3234  “Object  Oriented  Programming”.  This  set  of 
constraints  is  a  CONJUNCTION  of  DISJUNCTIONS:  the  student  must  certainly  have  passed 
ITC2088, and must have taken at least one of ITC2197 and ITC3234. This conjunction is easily 
written down as the following 2 constraints: 

𝑠−𝑘𝑠

𝑥3287,𝑠 ≤ ∑ 𝑥2197,𝑡

𝑡=0

𝑠−𝑘𝑠

 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑘𝑠 = {

3 𝑖𝑓 𝑠%5 == 0
1 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒                 

𝑥3287,𝑠 ≤ ∑ (𝑥2197,𝑡 + 𝑥3234,𝑡)

𝑡=0

 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑘𝑠 = {

3 𝑖𝑓 𝑠%5 == 0
1 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒                 

Such  disjunctive  constraints  are  particularly  useful  when  a  degree  program  undergoes 
changes and a course is “phased-out” in favor of another new course, but students can easily 
be caught in the midst of such a transition. In general, any set of pre-requisite constraints at 
ACG  in  its  most  general  form  is  written  as  a  disjunction  of  conjunctions  (DNF)  which  can 
automatically be converted to a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) that is  then modeled as a 
number of simultaneous constraints that must hold for each conjunct in the CNF, and each 
constraint is then of the form (1’) above. 

Similarly, the co-requisite constraints for the scheduling of the courses are as follows: 

𝑥𝑗,𝑠 ≤ ∑

𝑠−𝑘𝑠
𝑡=0

𝑥𝑖,𝑡

+ 𝑥𝑖,𝑠  ∀(𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗) ∈ 𝐸′, 𝑠 = 1 … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑘𝑠 = {

3 𝑖𝑓 𝑠%5 == 0
1 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒                 

                    (2) 

Constraints (2) are essentially the same as (1), but now it is allowed for the student to take 
course 𝑐𝑗 in term 𝑠 as long as course 𝑐𝑖 has been taken until term 𝑠 − 𝑘𝑠 or if 𝑥𝑖,𝑠 = 1 which 

 
  
means that course 𝑐𝑖 is taken concurrently with 𝑐𝑗 in the same term. There are no complex co-
requisite constraints currently at ACG, even though it is easy to incorporate them as well if 
needed. 

2.3.2 Level Constraints 
Given  the  Level-k  courses  denoted  by  𝐿4, 𝐿5, 𝐿6  in  section  2.1,  there  are  some  complex-
sounding constraints that go as follows: 

•  For a student to register for a Level-5 course, they must have completed at least 4 

Level-4 courses 

•  For a student to register for a Level-6 course, they must have completed ALL required 

Level-4 courses, and they must have completed at least 4 Level-5 courses 

These  constraints  cannot  be  modeled  in  terms  of  variables  indicating  the  term  in  which  a 
student takes a course. 

However, we can still model all Level-5 constraints using the binary 𝑥𝑖,𝑠 variables as follows: 

𝑥𝑖,𝑠 ≤

1
4

∑

𝑠−𝑘𝑠
𝑡=0
𝑗∈𝐿4

𝑥𝑗,𝑡

 ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝐿5, ∀𝑠 = 1, … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑘𝑠 = {

3 𝑖𝑓 𝑠%5 == 0
1 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒                 

                                        (3) 

The meaning of constraints (3) is simple: until the term 𝑠 for which the variables 𝑥𝑗,𝑡 sum to at 
least 4 between terms 0 and 𝑠 − 𝑘𝑠, the constraint is active and since the RHS of the constraint 
is less than 1, it forces the binary variables 𝑥𝑖,𝑠 to stay at zero, preventing the student from 
taking any Level-5 course in such terms; afterwards however, the constraint simply becomes 
inactive, allowing the student to take the course at this or any later term if they want. 

Similarly, the Level-6 constraints are modeled as follows: 

𝑥𝑖,𝑠 ≤

1
4

∑

𝑠−𝑘𝑠
𝑡=0
𝑗∈𝐿5

𝑥𝑗,𝑡

 ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝐿6, ∀𝑠 = 1, … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑘𝑠 = {

3 𝑖𝑓 𝑠%5 == 0
1 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒                 

                                        (4) 

𝑥𝑖,𝑠 ≤

1
|𝐿4|

∑

𝑠−𝑘𝑠
𝑡=0
𝑗∈𝐿4

𝑥𝑗,𝑡

 ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝐿6, ∀𝑠 = 1, … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑘𝑠 = {

3 𝑖𝑓 𝑠%5 == 0
1 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒                 

                                    (5) 

The constraints (4) ask for at least 4 Level-5 courses to be completed before a Level-6 class 
becomes  available  for  a  student;  constraints  (5)  require  that  ALL  Level-4  courses  are 
completed before a Level-6 class becomes available to the student. 

2.3.3 Class Availability Constraints 
Of  course,  courses  are  not  offered  every  term  (see  section  1.1).  Therefore,  the  following 
constraints must hold to indicate that a student cannot register for a course at a time when 
the course is not offered by the college: 

𝑥𝑖,𝑠 ≤ 𝑜𝑖,𝑠 ∀𝑖 ∈ {1, … , 𝑁}, 𝑠 = 1, … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥                                                                                                                        (6) 

2.3.4 Credit and Subset Selection Constraints 
As  mentioned  already,  the  student must  accumulate  a  number  of  credits  to  graduate  (see 
section 1.1): 

𝑁
∑ 𝑐̅𝑖
𝑖=1

𝑥𝑖 ≥ 𝑇𝑐                                                                                                                                                                                    (7) 

The value of the variable 𝑥𝑖 is simply the sum of the variables 𝑥𝑖,𝑠 over all terms: 

∑

𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑠=0

𝑥𝑖,𝑠

= 𝑥𝑖  ∀𝑖 = 1, … 𝑁                                                                                                                                                    (8) 

Of the total credits the student accumulates, there is a minimum required number of credits 
that must come from Liberal Education courses (see section 2.1): 

∑

𝑥𝑖 ≥ 𝐿𝑐                                                                                                                                                                                 (9) 

Every semester, the student can only take up to the maximum number of credits 𝐶𝑚𝑎𝑥 (see 
section 1.1): 

𝑁
∑ 𝑐̅𝑖
𝑖=1

𝑥𝑖,𝑠 ≤ 𝐶𝑚𝑎𝑥 ∀𝑠 = 1, … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥                                                                                                                               (10) 

Finally, for each set 𝑅𝑗 ⊂ 𝐶 𝑗 = 1 … 𝑘, the student must take at least 𝑟𝑗 courses: 

∑

𝑖∈𝑅𝑗 ≥ 𝑟𝑗 ∀𝑗 = 1, … 𝑘                                                                                                                                                         (11) 

𝑥𝑖

The  constraints  (11)  model  the  requirement  that  once  a  student  chooses  an  “area  of 
concentration” or “pathway”, they must take at least a certain number of courses belonging 
to this concentration group. 

2.3.5 Individual Course Selection and/or Assignment Constraints 
A  student  may  easily  declare  their  intent  to  take  a set of  specific  classes  ∅ ⊆ 𝑆𝑑 ⊂ 𝐶.  The 
constraint to do that is simply written as: 

𝑥𝑖 = 1 ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝑆𝑑                                                                                                                                                                                 (12) 

In a similar fashion, one may wish to take a particular course 𝑐𝑖 on a particular term 𝑡. The 
constraint simply becomes 

𝑥𝑖,𝑡 = 1                                                                                                                                                                                                  (13) 

Notice that introducing the above constraints may make the optimization problem infeasible 
if any of the above constraints conflicts with the rest of the constraints 1.3.1--1.3.4. 

2.3.6 Summer Terms Off Constraints 
In case the student does not want to take any courses during the summer terms, this desire is 
modelled as follows: 

𝑥𝑖,𝑠 = 0 ∀𝑖 = 1, … 𝑁, ∀𝑠 ∈ {𝑠𝑛, … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥} ∧ (𝑠%5 ∉ {1,2})                                                                            (14) 

where 𝑠𝑛 is the current term. 

2.3.7 Soft-order Precedence Constraints 
While  working  on  this  problem,  we  realized  that  in  most  programs  there  are  courses  the 
students take that would be better if they were taken in the opposite order from which the 
students  often  take  them.  For  example,  course  ITC2095  “Software  Engineering  Practices” 
would  be  better  understood  by  the  student  if  the  student  had  already  taken  ITC3160 
“Fundamentals of RDBMS”, yet neither course is pre-requisite or co-requisite for the other; in 
fact, ITC3160 is a higher level (Level-5) course whereas ITC2095 is a lower-level course (Level-
4) and this level-order suggests to many students they should take them in the wrong order. 
To  avoid  such  problems,  we  implement  a  soft-order  precedence  constraint  between  two 
courses 𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗to indicate that if a student takes both courses, then they should be taken in the 
order 𝑐𝑖 → 𝑐𝑗 (𝑐𝑖first, then 𝑐𝑗). This is modeled according to the inequalities (15) below: 

 𝑥𝑗,𝑠 ≤ ∑

𝑠−𝑘𝑠
𝑡=0

𝑥𝑖,𝑡

+ 1 − 𝑥𝑖   𝑠 = 1 … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑘𝑠 = {

3 𝑖𝑓 𝑠%5 == 0
1 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒                 

                                         (15) 

If the user does not take the course 𝑐𝑖 then 𝑥𝑖 = 0 and the constraint becomes inactive; if 
however the user does take course 𝑐𝑖 then the constraint asks that if they take course 𝑐𝑗 that 
they take it on a term that follows the time they take 𝑐𝑖 by at least one term under “normal 
circumstances”, and by at least 3 terms if the term they take 𝑐𝑗 is “SummerTerm” that runs 
concurrently with Summer1 and Summer2. Further, if the user has already passed course 𝑐𝑗 
then  the  variable  𝑥𝑗,0 = 1  and  𝑥𝑗,𝑠 = 0 ∀𝑠 = 1, … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥  and  the  constraints  (15)  are simply 
inactive regardless of whether the student takes in the future course 𝑐𝑖. 

2.3.8 Further Optional Constraints 
The student may optionally indicate a maximum number 𝑇𝑚𝑥 > 0 of courses they desire to 
register  for  during  any  term;  this  is  in  addition  to  the  credit-imposed  constraints  on  the 
number of courses a student can register for during any term (see section 2.1). This is enforced 
by the following set of constraints: 

𝑁
∑ 𝑥𝑖,𝑠
𝑖=1

≤ 𝑇𝑚𝑥,   ∀𝑠 = 1 … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥                                                                                                                                     (16) 

The student may also optionally indicate a maximum number of courses 𝛩𝑚𝑥 ≥ 1 to register 
for during the same term that they register for their B.Sc. thesis, denoted by 𝑐𝜃. In a similar 
fashion as above, this is enforced by the following set of constraints: 

∑

𝛮
𝑖=1
𝑖≠𝜃

𝑥𝑖,𝑠

≤ (𝛩𝑚𝑥 − 1)𝑥𝜃,𝑠 + 𝑀(1 − 𝑥𝜃,𝑠)  ∀𝑠 = 1, … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥                                                                        (17) 

where  𝑀  denotes  any  number  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  largest  number  of  courses  a 
student is allowed to take per term (the quantity 𝐶𝑚𝑎𝑥 is a valid candidate since every course 
is always worth at least 1 credit). The constraints (17) are easily understood when we consider 
what they represent in the two complementary cases when 𝑥𝜃,𝑠 = 0 or 𝑥𝜃,𝑠 = 1. In the 1st 
case, the constraint is ∑
≤ 𝑀 which is always inactive given the value of the quantity 

𝑥𝑖,𝑠

𝛮
𝑖=1
𝑖≠𝜃

𝑀. In the 2nd case on the other hand, the constraint ∑

𝑥𝑖,𝑠

≤ 𝛩𝑚𝑥 − 1 is enforced which 

𝛮
𝑖=1
𝑖≠𝜃

constrains the total number of other courses taken during the same term that the student 
takes course 𝑐𝜃 to less than 𝛩𝑚𝑥. 

2.4 Objective Functions 
2.4.1 Shortest Completion Time 
A  common  objective  from  a  student’s  perspective  is  to  graduate  as  soon  as  possible!  The 
objective function is then written as follows: 

Subject to the extra constraints: 

min 𝐷 

∑

𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑠=1

𝑠𝑥𝑖,𝑠

≤ 𝐷 ∀𝑖 = 1, … 𝑁                                                                                                                                                (18) 

2.4.2 Difficulty Balance  
Another frequent desire among students is to have a balanced class requirements (in terms 
of total difficulty levels of classes) between semesters. The relevant objective then is written 
as an objective to minimize the difference between the total difficulty in any two semesters 

 
until graduation. Given that the current semester is 𝑠𝑛, the objective to minimize is therefore 
written as   

𝑁

𝑁

min
𝑠,𝑠′=1,…𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥

|∑ 𝑑̅𝑖𝑥𝑖,𝑠 − ∑ 𝑑̅𝑖𝑥𝑖,𝑠′
𝑖=1

𝑖=1

| 

The  above  objective  function  is  written  in  terms  of  absolute  values,  but  can  be  easily  re-
written  in  terms of  a   Linear  Mixed  Integer  Programming Problem  (MILP) with  the  help of 
newly introduced continuous variables 𝑡𝑠,𝑠′ as follows: 

Subject to the extra constraints: 

min 𝐷𝐿 

𝐷𝐿 ≥ ∑ 𝑑̅𝑖𝑥𝑖,𝑠 − ∑ 𝑑̅𝑖𝑥𝑖,𝑠′

𝑁
𝑖=1

𝑁
𝑖=1

𝐷𝐿 ≥ ∑ 𝑑̅𝑖𝑥𝑖,𝑠′ − ∑ 𝑑̅𝑖𝑥𝑖,𝑠

𝑁
𝑖=1

𝑁
𝑖=1

  ∀𝑠, 𝑠′ = 1 … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥                                                                                           (19) 

  ∀𝑠, 𝑠′ = 1 … 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥                                                                                           (20) 

2.4.3 Maximizing the Expected GPA via AI 
Even though the above objectives are quite significant, from the student point of view, the 
most  important  objective  for  any  schedule  is  to  maximize  their  expected  GPA  as  the 
cumulative grade point average is considered the ultimate metric of success in school, at least 
during Bachelor’s studies. We would like therefore to be able to come up with a schedule of 
courses  whereby  the  expected  student  GPA  would  be  maximized  given  the  courses  we 
suggest. At first glance, one might think that based on the difficulty level of courses introduced 
earlier  in  the  beginning  of  section  2.1,  a  schedule  that  minimizes  the  total  difficulty  of  all 
classes taken should lead to higher GPA overall, but this ignores the facts that difficulty level 
is  associated  mostly  with  class  failure  rates  rather  than  actual  grades,  and  also  that  the 
objective associated with difficulty levels is to distribute difficult classes across terms in the 
schedule; so that the difficulty level may only help students improve their GPA in an indirect 
manner. Further, the difficulty level approach is a purely static approach that does not take 
into account individual student performance on classes taken so far. 

Instead,  having  access  to  fully  anonymized  student  records,  we  developed  a  Machine 
Learning/Data Mining inspired approach whereby we extract from the dataset containing all 
student course records the set of all quantitative association rules that hold on the dataset 
with minimum user-specified support and confidence that are in one of the following 3 forms: 

𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒(𝑐𝑖) ≥ 𝑣𝑖 → 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒(𝑐𝑗) ≥ 𝑣𝑗 

𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒(𝑐𝑖) ≥ 𝑣𝑖   ∧ 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒(𝑐𝑗) ≥ 𝑣𝑗 → 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒(𝑐𝑘) ≥ 𝑣𝑘 

𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒(𝑐𝑖) ≥ 𝑣𝑖 ∧ 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒(𝑐𝑗) ≥ 𝑣𝑗 ∧ 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒(𝑐𝑘) ≥ 𝑣𝑘 → 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒(𝑐𝑚) ≥ 𝑣𝑚 

We  extract  the  above  ruleset  with  minimal  support  threshold  set  to  0.5%  and  minimal 
confidence threshold set to 90% using QARMA (Christou, Amolochitis & Tan, 2018), (Christou, 
2019) a highly parallel/distributed tool developed by one of us, that has given excellent results 
in various diverse applications so far (see Christou et al. (2022) for applications in Predictive 
Maintenance and the fashion industry). The above rules predict student success on not yet 
taken courses based on student success on already taken courses; intuitively this makes sense, 
as common experience says for example, that a student that obtained a very high grade on 

 
calculus is likely to get a very high grade on applied math, and similarly, someone who gets a 
high  grade  on  an  Operating  Systems  course  is  likely  to  also  get  a  high  grade  on  a  High 
Performance Computing course. Given this ruleset, we estimate for each student their grade 
𝑔̂𝑐 they are going to get on a course 𝑐 as the highest value 𝑣𝑚𝑥 predicted by any rule in the 
ruleset that has 𝑐 as its consequent that fires given the student’s course taking history. If no 
rule fires for a particular course given the user’s history (which obviously is going to happen 
for all courses given a freshman student that has passed no courses yet) we simply do not 
assign any predicted grade to this course. 

Given the above, the objective to optimize becomes  

𝑁
∑ 𝑔̂𝑖𝑥𝑖
𝑖=1
𝑖∈𝐴

‖{𝑖 ∈ 𝐴: 𝑥𝑖 = 1}‖

max

where 𝐴 is the set of all courses open for the student to take for which we have an estimate 
𝑔̂ of the grade the student will get that is above a pre-defined threshold 𝑔𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠 > 0, with the 
threshold being set to 2.5 for a final grade that ranges between 0 and 4. The reason for this 
threshold’s existence is to avoid proposing courses to the student that we estimate they will 
not do well, just because we luck estimates for other courses. To bring the above objective in 
MILP format, we rewrite it as follows, considering that at any given time, the student must 
take a known number of credits (say 𝐶̂𝑟𝑒𝑚 > 0) to graduate: 

Subject to the extra constraints: 

max 𝐺𝑒 

𝐺𝑒 ≤ ∑ 𝑔̂𝑖𝑥𝑖

𝑖∈𝐴

                                                                                                                                                                                (21) 

∑ 𝑐̅𝑖𝑥𝑖
𝑖∈𝐴

≤ 𝐶̂𝑟𝑒𝑚                                                                                                                                                                           (22) 

The above maximization objective together with the constraints (21)-(22) aim to maximize the 
expected  GPA  of  the  student,  given  their  past  record,  and  constitutes  a  completely 
personalized approach to planning for student success. 

Why Not Use Neural Networks? 

It is worth noting that the above  described rule-based  approach cannot be easily replaced 
with  popular  techniques  such  as  (Deep)  Neural  Networks  (Gutierrez-Rojas  et  al.  2022),  for 
several reasons. Besides the fact that if we used Neural Network technology we would need 
to train as many networks as there are available courses for the student to choose from which 
would constitute a significant waste of resources, the main concern applying this technology 
has to do with the nature of the dataset itself: the dataset is very sparse in the sense that 
every student registers for up to 40 courses, while there is a total of more than 180 courses 
available to the student to choose from. This implies that if the grade of a student in a course 
is a feature, the cells of every row in the dataset would be more than 75% empty (containing 
null values), and of course, for freshman students, their corresponding rows would be almost 
100%  empty. Neural networks  do not  handle missing values  well, even with the  advent of 
imputation (Lin & Tsai, 2020) and GAN-based learning techniques (Goodfellow et al, 2014), 
and certainly not in datasets that are 75% or more sparse. 

 
2.4.4 Prioritizing and Combining Objectives 
The objectives developed and discussed in sections 2.4.1-2.4.3 are not mutually exclusive and 
in fact, given student priorities can be easily combined in one single objective, according to 
the linear objective function 

𝐶(𝐷, 𝐷𝐿, 𝐺𝑒) = 𝑏𝐺𝐺𝑒 + 𝑏𝐷𝐷 + 𝑏𝐷𝐿𝐷𝐿                                                                                                                           (23) 

Even  though  it  is  possible  to ask  the  student  to  consider  objectives  separately,  and  create 
schedules  for  each  different  objective  separately,  and  perform  what-if  scenarios,  we  have 
found it more convenient to simply ask the student to choose what they consider their most 
important  criterion  for  course  planning,  and  the  remaining  two  objectives  are  prioritized 
according to a fixed order: when the student considers their most important objective to be 
their expected GPA, the variable 𝐺𝑒 is multiplied by the coefficient 𝑏𝐺 = −1000 (the overall 
problem is always a minimization problem), the variable 𝐷 (see section 2.4.1) is multiplied by 
the  coefficient  𝑏𝐷 = 100,  and  the  variable  𝐷𝐿  (see  section  2.4.2)  is  multiplied  by  the 
coefficient 𝑏𝐷𝐿 = 1; otherwise, when the student considers their most important objective 
the time to complete their studies, the coefficient 𝑏𝐷 = 1000, the coefficient 𝑏𝐺 = −100 and 
the coefficient 𝑏𝐷𝐿 = 1 again. 

3. System Implementation 
The schedule optimization takes the form of a desktop application that accepts user-input, 
creates the model with the combined objective function (23), and subject to the constraints 
(1)-(22), produces an LP-format file, and then calls an optimization solver (currently GUROBI) 
to solve the problem specified in the lp file. The GUI is shown in Fig. 1, where we show the 
results of an optimization run for a freshman student, planning to take their first course in the 
Fall 2022 semester. 

Figure 1: SCORER GUI 

 
The idea is that the student must enter the courses they have passed so far (this can also be 
loaded  from  a  file  by  choosing  “Load”  from  the  File  menu),  and  enter  the  following 
information: 

•  Their desired concentration area which is used to determine a subset of courses that 

will be necessary to choose from, 

•  Any individual courses the student wishes to take from their program of study,  
•  The optimization objective to choose from, which sets priorities for all objectives, as 

discussed in 2.4.4, 

•  Whether the student is an honors student or not, 
•  Any student preferences towards registering for summer courses, and 
•  Student preferences towards maximum number of courses per term, and/or during 

their thesis 

Given this information, by clicking “Run”, the optimization problem is formulated, and the 
output when computed, written as text in the “Output Area” which can also be then saved in 
a text file. The outputs area, besides providing the full course schedule as computed by the 
optimizer’s solution to the model, also includes an editor window in the lower right corner, 
under  the  heading  “Edit  Time-Slots  for  Courses”  whereby  the  user  can  indicate  their 
preferences  towards  the  produced  schedule;  the  user  can  indicate  if  they  would  like  any 
proposed course to be scheduled at any other time, which they do so by indicating the terms 
when they would like to take the course; or they can simply reject the course by entering a 
minus sign “-“ to indicate they don’t want to take this course. Clicking the “Change Terms” 
button modifies the desired courses list area, allowing the next optimization run to take the 
new information into account. 

3.1 System Design 
As already mentioned, we developed the system as a small-scale (just above 5,000 loc) Java 
desktop application that uses the GUROBI Java API (Gurobi, 2022b) to communicate with the 
GUROBI optimizer, and the Java Swing API for GUI development. There is a small number of 
classes that together implement the system, as shown in the screenshot in Fig. 2. 

Figure 2: ACG SCORER Modules/Class Design 

The heart of the system is the class MIPHandler which is responsible for reading all problem 
data,  creating  the  relevant  model,  and  passing  it  to  the  MIP  solver  to  solve  it. The  classes 
MainGUI,  CourseEditor  and  CourseGroupEditor  implement  the  graphical  user 
interfaces of the system. 

3.2. Administrator Interfaces 
To help department heads create the data files needed by our program, we also developed a 
couple of user interfaces. The first user interface guides an administrator edit course-related 
data (add/edit/delete courses), and is shown in fig. 3. In the same minimalistic design spirit 
that we used for our main GUI (fig. 1), this interface considers the screen to be a simple card 
displaying  information  about  a  single  course  at  a  time,  and  allowing  the  user  to  edit  any 
information about the single course currently being displayed. If the user wants to save the 
changes they make to a course, they need to press the button “Save Course Changes”, which 
saves the user edits, but only in memory (not to the disk). To save the relevant changes the 
user has made permanently, the user needs to press the button “Save to Disk”, after having 
pressed “Save Course Changes”.  

Of  course,  a  viable  alternative  for  an  administrator  to  edit  courses,  is  to  directly  edit  the 
relevant file (a standard ASCII CSV file) using a program such as Microsoft Excel. 

 
Figure 3: Course Editor GUI 

In  a  similar  spirit  to  the  design  of  our  first  administrator  interface  for  editing courses,  our 
second administrator interface helps authorized users create and edit course groups which 
are used in defining the constraints that any valid schedule must obey. The GUI is shown in 
fig. 4. The selected group “LE-core-stat” contains 3 courses (MA2010, MA2021, and MA2025, 
see discussion on extension to complex pre-requisite constraints in section 2.3.1) which are 
all statistics courses offered by the Math department. The fact that the check-box “#Courses 
denotes Maximum” is selected, means that the value in the text field “#Courses Constraint 
Value” (1) indicates the exact number of courses that should be taken from this group. The 
check-box “#Courses Constraint Applies Per Term” if checked, indicates that the constraint 
applies not globally, but on a semester level, essentially setting an upper limit on the number 
of courses from the group that the student is allowed to take during the same term. The user 
may edit the selected course group whose details appear in the GUI form at any given time by 
editing the group properties (possibly modifying even the courses that comprise the group) 
and then clicking on the “Save Group” button. New groups can be created using the “New 
Group” button, and existing groups can be deleted by selecting them from the list and pressing 
the “Remove Group” button. 

Some  constraints  have  special  meaning  that  is  assigned  to  them  by  the  group’s  name. 
Therefore, any group whose name begins with the string “softorder” is a soft-order constraint, 
whose meaning we already discussed in section 2.3.7. Any group whose name begins with the 
string  “HonorGroup”  indicates  classes  only  available  to  honor  students.  And  the  𝐿4, 𝐿5, 𝐿6 
classes are contained in special course groups with the indicative names “L4”, “L5” and “L6” 
respectively.

4. Results 
The Information Technology (IT) program at Deree offers a total of 69 courses in ITC whereas 
the total number of courses available to the students exceed 180. Scheduling a freshman who 
has yet to take their first class, results in a MIP with 3 continuous variables (the ones shown 
in  the objective  function)  and  7854  binary  variables  and  a  total  of  36,253  constraints.  The 
Cyber-security  and  Networks  (CYN)  program  is  a  separate  program  running  at  Deree  that 
requires students to take 24 specific courses in that area, and another 4 courses in ITC, with 
the total number of courses available to students still exceeding 180. Such models are solved 
by GUROBI 9.5.1 on an old laptop equipped with a 3rd generation intel core i-7 CPU with 16GB 
RAM usually in less than 10 seconds, making the program respond almost in real-time to the 
user  requests,  and  thus  allowing  for  extensive  schedule  editing  and  sensitivity  analysis 
afterwards. Table 1 provides some data on the time it takes to produce useful schedules on 
such  an old  laptop  for  both  the  IT  and  CYN  programs.  As can  be  seen,  the  run-time  never 
exceeds 3.5 seconds of wall-clock time; in fact, the more constrained is the student schedule 
(by courses already passed), the easier it becomes for the model to be optimized. The careful 
reader might notice that in fig. 1 which shows the results of the run corresponding to the 1st 
row of Table 1, the response time of the system is mentioned to have taken 4.18 seconds but 
this includes the time that it takes the system to gather the data, prepare and write the lp file, 
and call the GUROBI optimizer. The label “7+1” for the number of desired courses specified in 
the 3rd row indicates that the student indicated 7 courses they would like to take, and 1 course 
they wish not to take. 

 
 
Table 1: ACG SCORER Running Times Under Various Scenarios 

Given  the  consistent  response  times  of  the  system,  the  department  heads  and  program 
coordinators advising the undergraduate student body have reduced their load by more than 
3 orders of magnitude (from around 3,600 seconds per student, to under 3.4 seconds!) What 
is equally, if not more, important, the system is able to suggest a plan of courses to the student 
that maximizes their expected GPA, which is a major Key Performance Indicator of measuring 
student success at the undergraduate level, something that was not previously possible to be 
done manually due to the enormous amount of effort required to comb through the data to 
estimate what courses would be a good fit for every student separately. 

4.1. System Responsiveness under Open-Source MIP Solvers 
As  seen  from  the  results  of  Table  1,  the  system  responds  very  quickly  to  user  commands, 
making it a highly interactive tool that can be used to edit schedules very fast, at least when 
the MIP problem is given to the state-of-the-art commercial solver GUROBI. In Table 2, we 
compare on the same machine (a laptop equipped with an intel core i7 3630QM CPU with 
16GB RAM) run-times for schedule creation in the most difficult of circumstances, which is 
students  having  taken  no  credits  so  far,  for  the  GUROBI  9.5  as  well  as  SCIP  8.0 
(https://www.scipopt.org),  currently  one  of  the  fastest  non-commercial,  Open-Source  MIP 
solvers in the world. As can be seen, SCIP is a viable alternative, always managing to find the 
optimal solution to the problem, but the run-time makes SCORER less interactive than it is 
when GUROBI is used as the underlying solver. In defense of Open-Source software, it can be 
argued  that  on  a  more  modern  machine,  the  running  time  of  the  SCIP  solver  should  be 
expected to be reduced to much more acceptable levels (in the orders of less than 1 minute 
for all cases.)

5. Conclusions and Future Directions 
At ACG, the  problem of advising students as to what classes to take in the  course of their 
studies has been a manual, intensive labor process for the department heads and program 
coordinators, taking an estimated toll of up to 750 hours of human labor of faculty high up in 
the hierarchy every semester. Using modern advances in optimization software and modeling, 
we have managed to reduce this workload by offloading the problem to computers that can 
solve it almost instantaneously. The response times of the software, together with the course 
editing user interfaces we have implemented, allow students themselves to use the software 
and edit the resultant proposed schedules as many times as they wish until they get the course 
plan that feels exactly right for them.  

What is more important, utilizing advanced data mining techniques, we have managed to be 
able to often get accurate estimates for the grade a student is going to get on a course, before 
they even register for it, an ability that we have since integrated into the proposed course 
plans that our automated software builds so as to maximize the student’s expected GPA, the 
most significant measure of success during undergraduate studies. 

The  system  is  currently  in  use  by  the  Information  Technology  and  the  Cyber-security  and 
Networks programs at Deree College of the ACG. Our short-term plans include deploying our 
program for use by most if not all programs offered by the Deree College’s undergraduate as 
well  as  graduate  schools.  We  also  plan  to  further  improve  the  course  grade  predictor 
(currently based on QARMA) and test its limits, to see if it is possible to accurately estimate 
student success on a given program before the student is admitted to that program, while 
ensuring the absence of any biases in the system’s decision making process. The explainable 
and interpretable nature of QARMA, as opposed to opaque methods such as neural networks, 
should offer significant help in this respect.
