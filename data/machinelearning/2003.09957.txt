ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present a monitoring system that allows increasing road safety by
predicting ice formation. The system consists of a network of road weather stations
and intelligence data processing program module. The results were achieved by
combining physical models for forecasting road conditions based on measurements
from stations and machine learning models for detecting incorrect data and forecast
correction.

boosting

1. Introduction

Road safety is a complex issue that includes many aspects. Some of them depend on
human behavior; others depend on infrastructure conditions. For example, in many
regions of the Russian Federation, spring and autumn temperatures can ﬂuctuate near
0◦C, which in combination with rains and high humidity could lead to ice formation
on the roads. Detection of these conditions is essential for road safety.

Online monitoring allows preventing road accidents by early maintenance; for ex-
ample, we can use video monitoring of roads’ conditions. Machine learning techniques
enable detecting ice formation automatically. For instance, in Zhao, Wu, and Chen
(2017), the authors used data collected from stationary cameras to distinguish be-
tween ﬁve diﬀerent conditions of the road pavement. In Roychowdhury, Zhao, Wallin,
Ohlsson, and Jonasson (2018), authors proposed to collect video from vehicle front
cameras instead of static cameras, and to use a more accurate classiﬁcation technique
based on convolutional neural networks.

Despite all their advantages, video monitoring with ordinary cameras struggles with
black ice detection. In order to ﬁx this problem we can use multispectral cameras Gre-
goris, Yu, and Teti (2004), NIR cameras Jonsson, Casselgren, and Th¨ornberg (2014),
or measure depth with Kinect sensor Abdalla, Iqbal, and Shehata (2017). These tech-
niques are more expensive than ordinary cameras; however, they can provide better
results.

A video monitoring system is costly. It can be reasonable to use sensors that col-
lect other characteristics of road conditions like temperature, humidity, pressure, and

others. Stations collecting this sort of data are called road weather information sys-
tems (RWIS). They can be located on the sides of roads or even inside the pave-
ment Tabatabai and Aljuboori (2017).

By processing historical information on road conditions, we can predict ice forma-
tion. We can group forecasting algorithms into two major categories. The ﬁrst category
uses physical models Barber (1957); Dai, Zeng, Dickinson, Baker, Bonan, Bosilovich,
Denning, Dirmeyer, Houser, Niu, et al. (2003); Feng and Feng (2012); Sass (1997) or
their combinations like in Chunlei and Changyou (2009). The authors combine results
of the physical models Common Land Model (CoLM) and BJ-RUC FAN, CHEN,
ZHONG, and ZHENG (2009), which allowed increasing the accuracy. Later in this
paper, we take a closer look at the physical model METRo. It performs exception-
ally well in countries like Czech Republic Sokol, Zacharov, Sedl´ak, Hoˇsek, Bliˇzˇn´ak,
Chl´adov´a, Peˇsice, and ˇSkuthan (2014), Canada Crevier and Delage (2001), USA Rutz
and Gibson (2013), China FAN et al. (2009).

Despite impressive track records, physical models have several problems. The main
disadvantage is their computational complexity since they require the numerical solu-
tion of partial derivative equations. Another challenge is the deterministic nature of
their forecasts. These algorithms provide forecast values but struggle with delivering
a level of conﬁdence. It is possible to solve this issue with the Mont-Carlo simulation
Berrocal, Raftery, Gneiting, and Steed (2010); Chapman (2012), but it signiﬁcantly in-
creases computational complexity. Another challenge for this kind of models is anthro-
pogenic factors, which are extremely diﬃcult to estimate. There are some approaches
with an additional prior assumption about anthropogenic factor behaviour Khalifa,
Marchetti, Bouilloud, Martin, Bues, and Chancibault (2016), but still, they cannot
deal with stochastic eﬀects and increase already signiﬁcant computational complexity.
Another big group of techniques uses machine learning and statistical approaches
to road conditions forecast. Even a simple linear regression allows to get reasonable
forecasting accuracy; however, usually, people use these methods as part of more com-
plex solutions Diefenderfer, Al-Qadi, Reubush, and Freeman (2003); Liao, Chen, Chen,
and Huang (2009); YANG, PENG, and LIU (2010). Using more sophisticated machine
learning algorithms like deep neural networks allows getting even better forecast accu-
racy Gensler, Henze, Sick, and Raabe (2016); Zaytar and El Amrani (2016). However,
this family of methods is not a silver bullet and has its problems. For example, a lack
of physical assumptions in modeling leads to a lack of interpretability and a constant
need for additional reﬁtting to work in a new environment.

It seems that both physical and machine-learning-based techniques have their prob-
lems; this is why we decide to build a hybrid system that would combine advantages of
both types of models. Another challenge is the quality of the data in such big systems
of sensors; it is pretty standard that some devices become malfunctioning, and it is
crucial to detect these broken sensors as soon as possible.

In this paper, we describe algorithmic techniques and software system, which al-
lows achieving the stated goal. To build an intelligence system for analyzing RWIS
data, we create a software system that takes the data from the sensors, validate if
this data correct. For the validated data, a forecasting model provides forecast of road
conditions, and these predictions are used to decide on further maintenance actions.
We concentrate on the correction of weather forecasting using machine learning and
anomaly (outlier) detection. Also, we brieﬂy describe the implementation of the soft-
ware system.

In section 2, we discuss an approach for weather forecasting. We propose an algo-
rithm that combines classical energy balance based model and correction of residuals

with Gradient Boosting on Decision Trees. In the section 3 we present an approach for
detecting broken RWIS sensors. In section 4, we demonstrate achieved performance
on real-world data collected from RWIS. And ﬁnally, in section 5, we discuss some
technical details about software system implementation.

2. Road Weather Condition Forecasting

In this section, we present a new approach for road weather condition forecasting
based on a combination of an energy balance model and machine learning. Both of
them have their pros and cons. So a combination of these techniques allows increasing
the accuracy of forecasting.

2.1. METRo

We choose METRo (Model of the Environment and Temperature of Road) as a primary
weather forecasting model Crevier and Delage (2001). This approach already demon-
strated great performance in various cases around the globe. Initially, this model was
tested on Canadian roads; climate similarity between Canada and Russia makes this
model a good candidate for the ﬁnal approach.

The core idea behind the model is to decompose temperature weave in several parts

R = (1 − α)S + εI − εσT 4

s − H − LaE ± Lf P + A,

here (1 − α)S is an absorbed incoming radiation ﬂux, εI is the absorbed incoming
infrared radiation ﬂux, σT 4 is an emitted ﬂux, H is a turbulence ﬂux, LaE is the
latent heat ﬂux, Lf P is a water phase changing ﬂux, ﬁnally A is an anthropogenetic
ﬂux.

We skip the detailed explanation of calculating these parts and coeﬃcients selection,
see the original paper for details Crevier and Delage (2001). For us, the anthropogenic
part is the most interesting. A partial derivative equation cannot model this component
because it is highly non-deterministic and so it introduces additional forecasting error.
However, we can ﬁx the error produced by this factor by using a machine learning
algorithm.

2.2. Forecast improvement with gradient boosting

To correct the METRo forecast, we predict the diﬀerence between its result and the
real values of road parameters. Here we illustrate this approach using four parameters
predicted by the METRo model: air, road, and under road temperatures and humidity.
be the value predicted by the
METRo model. We build an approximation of the diﬀerence between the real value
and predictions ∆yt = yt − yM ET Ro

Let yt be one of the target variables at time t, yM ET Ro

.

t

We construct an approximation function ∆yt ≈ F (xt), where xt is a feature vector
that represents road condition at time t. These features can be grouped into three
classes:

t

(1) Historical features collected from Road Weather Information Systems. They in-

clude information about air, road, and underground temperatures, etc.

3

(2) Information about year season and time of the day. Since these features have a
cyclic nature, we encode them by using trigonometric functions. Number of days
since the beginning of the year d produces two values sin(d/365) and cos(d/365)
or sin(d/366) and cos(d/366) in case of a leap year. Hour of the day h is trans-
formed into pair sin(h/24) and cos(h/24).
(3) Previous predictions from METRo equations.

We build an approximation function F (x) by minimizing a speciﬁed loss function

L(·, ·), which characterizes forecast accuracy:

ˆF = arg min

F

T
(cid:88)

t=1

L(F (xt), ∆yt).

To ﬁnd this optimal ˆF , we use the Gradient Boosting algorithm Friedman (2002).
Its main idea is to build a sequence of regression models, a combination of which
provides a good approximation. At step N , the approximation has the form:

ˆFN (x) =

N
(cid:88)

i=1

αihi(x),

where hi is a regression model with weight αi. On step N +1 we solve the optimization
subproblem to get the model hN +1:

QN +1 =

T
(cid:88)

t=1

L( ˆFN (xt) + αN +1hN +1(xt), ∆yt) → min

αN +1,hN +1

.

To get hN +1 we solve the subproblem:

hN +1 = arg min

To ﬁnd optimal αN +1 value, we solve the following optimization problem by the

linear search:

αN +1 = arg min

L( ˆFN (xt) + αhN +1(xt), ∆yt).

As a loss function we use the Mean Absolute Error:

M AE =

|∆yt − ˆF (xt)|.

For constructed ˆF (x) the ﬁnal prediction is:

ˆyt = yMETRo

+ ˆF (xt).

We construct 12 diﬀerent regression models to predict air, road, underground tem-

peratures, and humidity for the forecast horizons of 1, 2, and 3 hours.

3. Broken Sensors Detection

Accuracy of road condition forecasting depends on the quality of the data. It is crucial
to detect malfunction sensors as soon as possible. Wrong data could lead either to
conducting maintenance actions for no reason or, even worse, to miss the dangerous
road conditions.

Malfunctioning sensors generate abnormal data, and so we can detect broken sensors
by detecting anomalies in data. By anomaly, we consider the observation that deviates
from others so much that we could suspend that it came from another source Hawkins
(1980). To ﬁnd these values, we build an anomaly detector, i.e., the function such that:

f (yt) =

(cid:40)

1
−1

if yt is normal,
if yt is anomaly.

To construct the anomaly detector we

(1) predict a future value ˆyt of the target variable,
(2) compare it with the actual value yt of the target variable.

If the diﬀerence ∆t = |yt − ˆyt| is big, this could mean that something drastically has
changed, and this could be a symptom of a broken sensor. The anomaly detection
function takes the form

f (yt) =

(cid:40)

1
−1

if ∆t ≤ ∆,
if ∆t > ∆.

(1)

Accurate selection of threshold ∆ is very important: we have to reliably distinguish
between cases of just random ﬂuctuations and anomalies due to malfunctioning sen-
sors.

Usually, the value of ∆ is selected based on a holdout set or using the cross-validation
procedure Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2001). However, for that we need labeled
data. Since broken sensors are not frequent events, even such a signiﬁcant amount of
data like we have does not contain enough examples of anomalies. Moreover, labeling
is a tedious task. Therefore, we propose to use artiﬁcially generated anomalies to select
the threshold. We group all anomalies into three diﬀerent categories:

(1) Single anomalies, which can result in some deviation. They are modeled with

uniform distribution, see Fig. 1.

(2) Short-term anomalies modeled as a Poisson noise with random parameters see

Fig. 2.

(3) Long-term anomalies, which can be results of some signiﬁcant dis-functioning in
sensors or networks. They were modeled with a Gaussian noise, see Fig. 3.

To ﬁnd threshold ∆, we select a subset of data, add these artiﬁcial anomalies, and

ﬁnd the value of ∆, which provides the optimal F1 score:

F1 =

precision · recall
precision + recall

,

where recall is the fraction of correctly identiﬁed anomalies, while precision is the
fraction of anomalies we are able to ﬁnd.

4. Results

4.1. Forecasting Correction

This section discusses the experimental results of road condition forecasting based on
a combination of the METRo model and gradient boosting residual correction.

We collected data for seven years from 2012 till 2019 from 120 RWIS, located in
diﬀerent regions of Russia. This data was split into two parts. We ﬁt the model based
on data for the period 2012 – 2017 years. We also split data based on diﬀerent RWIS
locations. So, in the end, we have the test data from a later period of time, and from
RWIS that were not used while building a model. We measured the Mean Average
Error between the predicted value and the real one.

We compare our results with and without additional residual corrections. Example
of prediction are presented in Fig. 4. Table 1 demonstrates that additional machine
learning post-processing allows for increasing the accuracy of the ﬁnal forecast.

4.2. Anomaly Detection

This section discusses experimental results of predicting broken sensors of RWIS. Let
us consider experimental settings, metrics and ﬁnal accuracy indicators.

We select 59 RWIS stations from various regions of the Russian Federation. We use
data from 50 stations for training models and data from 9 stations for testing the
quality of the resulting model. The training set was split into two parts. Data from
35 RWIS was used to build a model; data from another 15 RWIS was used to tune
threshold value based on artiﬁcially generated anomalies.

We labeled data (normal/anomaly) from the 9 test stations manually. Final results

were evaluated by using F1 score.

We compare our approach with other anomaly detection techniques like Elliptic En-
velope Butler, Davies, and Jhun (1993), Isolation Forrest Liu, Ting, and Zhou (2008),
OneClassSVM with Gaussian kernel Sch¨olkopf, Smola, Williamson, and Bartlett
(2000). We also test diﬀerent regression algorithms to construct approximation ˆF (x)
beside gradient boosting over regression trees, speciﬁcally ridge regression Marquardt
and Snee (1975) and multi-layer perceptron Murtagh (1991). Results of the compari-
son are presented in Table 2. We can see that the proposed approach based on gradient
boosting outperforms all other algorithms in terms of the F1 score, see formula 2. Ta-
ble 1 demonstrates that if before making predictions with METRo model we remove
anomalous data, we can signiﬁcantly improve forecasting accuracy. Note that when
detecting anomalies we did not use METRo model for estimating ∆t in formula 1.

5. Implementation

Initially, company MinMax941 has already installed a system for road condition fore-
casting, which consists of the METRo module and decision-making module connected
to the MongoDB. We developed a system that could be easily added to this existed
infrastructure.

To do this, we developed two web services based on python library Flask and put
them into a docker container. They communicate with the outer world by HTTP
requests.

The dataﬂow is presented in Fig. 5. So the whole work process can be descrived as
follows: data from RWIS goes into the database, then the data is sent to the Anomaly
Detection Module. The module generates labels (normal/anomaly) for each observa-
tion. If there are many anomalies, we don’t use information from these sensors before
they would be checked and ﬁxed. Information about which observations are anomalous
is saved in the database.

If the data is normal we send it to the METRo module, which builds predictions. The
results are sent to the Residuals Correction module. Results of this module are sent
back to the database, and ﬁnally, they are passed into the decision-making module,
which decides if the road needs maintenance or not.

Models for Anomaly Detection and Residuals Corrections are constructed in ad-
vance. We collect historical data in CSV format, as described in section 4. Then we
use the lightgbm library Ke, Meng, Finley, Wang, Chen, Ma, Ye, and Liu (2017) to
build these predictive models. The whole process takes around 30 minutes on a desktop
computer with the Intel Core i7 processor and 32Gb RAM.

6. Conclusion

We proposed a novel approach to improve road surface condition forecasting. It allows
for combining the advantages of both energy-balanced and machine learning-based
models. Numerical results demonstrate that despite the very impressive accuracy of
the METRo model, it is still possible to improve accuracy by correcting residuals of
predictions. We describe details of the implementation of these algorithms as a part
of the software system for road condition forecasting.
