Abstract:  In  construction  projects,  estimation  of  the  settlement  of  fine-grained  soils  is  of  critical 
importance,  and  yet  is  a  challenging  task.  The  coefficient  of  consolidation  for  the  compression 
index (Cc) is a key parameter in modeling the settlement of fine-grained soil layers. However, the 
estimation  of  this  parameter  is  costly,  time-consuming,  and  requires  skilled  technicians.  To 
overcome these drawbacks, we aimed to predict Cc through other soil parameters, i.e., the liquid 
limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), and initial void ratio (e0). Using these parameters is more convenient 
and requires substantially less time and cost compared to the conventional tests to estimate Cc. This 
study  presents  a  novel  prediction  model  for  the  Cc  of  fine-grained  soils  using  gene  expression 
programming (GEP). A database consisting of 108 different data points was used to develop the 
model. A closed-form equation solution was derived to estimate  Cc  based on  LL, PL, and  e0. The 
performance  of  the  developed  GEP-based  model  was  evaluated  through  the  coefficient  of 
determination (R2), the root mean squared error (RMSE), and the mean average error (MAE). The 
proposed model performed better in terms of R2, RMSE, and MAE compared to the other models.

1. Introduction 

Soil  compressibility  is  considered  to  be  the  volume  reduction  under  load  of  pore  water 
drainage. A precise estimation of this property is critical for calculating the settlement of soil layers 
[1].  This  problem  has  become  more  critical  for  fine-grained  soils  due  to  their  low  permeability, 
resulting in the compression index (Cc) being the most accepted parameter to date to represent soil 
compressibility  [2].  This  parameter  is  often  utilized  for  measuring  the  individual  soil  layer 
settlement. Different empirical equations have been particularly developed to predict Cc [3-9]. These 
equations  were  mainly  developed  based  on  traditional  statistical  analyses.  Nevertheless,  they 
include  a  number  of  drawbacks,  such  as  a  low  correlation  between  input  and  output  parameters 
[10]. Thus, it is essential to develop a comprehensive model to analyze the complex behavior of Cc. 
This  model  should  significantly  eliminate  the  shortcomings  of  the  previous  models,  such  as 
practicality and a low correlation between input and output parameters.

Soft computing techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely accepted and 
popular,  along  with  conventional  statistical  methods  (e.g.,  regressions)  [11-21].  These  techniques 
have  been  successfully applied to different geotechnical problems, such as  Cc prediction  [7,22-27]. 
However, a major limitation of common soft computing techniques is that no closed-form prediction 
equation  is  provided  by  them.  With  the  introduction  of  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  techniques  and 
particularly genetic programming (GP), researchers in the field of soft computing have attempted to 
solve  this  issue  (i.e.,  obtaining  a  closed-form  solution).  AI  includes  various  techniques  of  ANNs, 
neuro-fuzzy neural networks (ANFIS), and support vector machines (SVMs), with a great record of 
successful application [28,29]. With AI, a learning mechanism often contributes to constructing the 
intelligent  structure  of  an  estimation  model.  Among  the  popular  AI  methods,  ANNs  present  a 
robust artificial tool that is widely used to predict Cc [7,22-26]. AI techniques have been reported to 
have an acceptable statistical performance in terms of correlation. These techniques are often known 
as  black  box  models  in  soft  computing,  and  they  mainly  lack  capability  in  offering  closed-form 
estimation  formulas  [10].  This,  been  reported  to  be  a  drawback  to  AI  techniques  that  limits  their 
practicality  [10,28].  Nevertheless,  the  runtime  for  most  soft  computing  techniques  could  be 
efficiently  decreased  by  using  parallel  processing  methods  [30].  Mohammadzadeh  et  al.  (2014) 
reviewed  state-of-the-art  soft  computing  models  and  proposed  multi-expression  programming 
(MEP) to model the Cc of fine-grained soils, and the proposed model outperformed ANNs [29].   

Genetic  programming  (GP)  and  also  multigene  genetic  programming  (MGGP),  which  is  an 
enhanced variation of GP using classical regression, have been used for modeling purposes  (of Cc) 
[28]. Mohammadzadeh et al. (2016) built an MGGP model to estimate Cc with higher accuracy, which 
presented  promising  results  [28].  The  GP-based  methods  of  modeling  are  classified  as  individual 
computational programming, which is a major family of soft computing techniques. GP models can 
empower and enable complex and highly nonlinear prediction modeling tasks [31]. While classical 
GP nominates only a single program, gene expression programming (GEP) includes several genes of 
programming for  reaching optimal solutions  [32]. The application of GEP is growing significantly 
compared to GP in the engineering domain mainly due to the accuracy of its predictions [28,29]. The 
current study investigated the use of GEP to develop a prediction equation for the Cc of fine-grained 
soils  existing  in  northeastern  Iran.  The  objective  of  this  study  was  developing  a  GEP-based 
prediction  equation  for  the  Cc  of  fine-grained  soils  with  simple  tests  such  as  the  Atterberg  liquid 
limit (LL) and plastic limit (PL). Since conventional consolidation tests of fine-grained soils (e.g., the 
oedometer  test) are time-consuming  and costly, the  application of such a prediction equation will 
lead to substantial savings for Cc estimation in terms of cost and time. 

2. GEP 

There are several variants of GP available for modeling. GEP is the latest variant of GP, and it is 
a powerful tool for approximating the solution of a problem in a closed-form format. Conventional 
GP  generates  computational  models  through  mimicking  the  biological  evolution  of  living 
organisms,  providing  a  tree-like  form  of  solution,  which  leads  to  the  closed-form  solution  of  the 
optimization  problem  [28,29,31-33].  The  main  objective  of  GP  is  obtaining  programs  that  connect 
inputs  to  outputs  for  each  data  point,  creating  a  population  of  programs.  The  population  of 
programs (in the form of a tree branch shape) created by GP includes functions and terminals, which 
are  randomly  generated.  The  final  solution  of  the  problem  is  determined  based  on  the  tree-like 
programs.   

The foundation of modeling with GEP was first developed by Ferreira in 2002 [34] and consists 
of a number of components, i.e., a terminal set, a function set, control parameters, a fitness function, 
and a termination function. GEP employs a fixed length of character strings to model the problem, 
unlike  the  conventional  GP.  These  characters  further  turn  into  parse  trees  in  various  sizes  and 
shapes, known as expression trees (ETs). The  benefit of GEP over conventional GP  is that genetic 
diversity  is  represented  as  genetic  operators  of  chromosomes.  GEP,  in  fact,  evolves  a  number  of 
genes  (subprograms)  [34]  that  are  individual  tree-like  programs  [10,34].  Furthermore,  GEP  has  a 
flexible  multigenetic  nature  suitable  for  the  construction  and  evolution  of  complex  networks  of

genes. In the GEP framework, the genes in a chromosome may consist of two types of information 
stored in either the tail or head of genes, i.e., information for generating the overall GEP model and 
the information from terminals for producing subsequent of the model. Specific details about GEP 
can be found elsewhere [10,31,32,34,35].   

Figure  1  presents  a  sample  program  illustration of  evolving  GEP,  where  d1, d2,  and  d3 are  the 
model inputs. Furthermore, the process evolution functions are +, -, ×, /, exponential function (exp()), 
natural logarithm function (ln()), and Inv. The presented model is linear, with coefficients c0, c1, and 
c2,  while  utilizing  nonlinear  terms  [31,32].  For  obtaining  c0,  c1,  and  c2,  a  simple  least  square  was 
applied to the training data. A partial least squares method could also be employed for this objective 
[18, 22]. The important GEP parameters that need to be carefully selected are the tree depth and the 
quantity  of  genes.  However,  minimizing  the  tree  depth  generally  results  in  shorter  closed-form 
equations with fewer numbers of terms [29,34].

3. Modeling of Cc for Fine-Grained Soils   

3.1. Data Collection   

A set of 108 individual consolidation test results obtained from laboratory tests were used to 
develop the GEP-based prediction equation. As mentioned earlier, the objective of this study was to 
predict Cc using conventional parameters of fine-grained soils, namely PL, LL, and e0. Here, 101 out 
of 108 data points corresponded to test results conducted on soil samples collected from different 
locations in Mashhad, Iran. Soil samples were classified as silty–clayey sand (SC–SM), gravelly lean 
clay with sand (CL), and silty clay with sand (CL–ML) based on the unified soil classification system. 
These samples were cored from a depth of 0.5 m to 1.0 m.  LL, PL, and e0 were measured for these 
samples in a laboratory based on ASTM D4318-17 and ASTM D854-14 [36,37]. Furthermore, Cc was 
measured using an oedometer test based on ASTM D2435-11 [38]. In addition, seven consolidation 
test results conducted by Malih [39] were integrated into the  laboratory database to make  it more 
robust. The descriptive statistics of influential input parameters (i.e., LL, PL, and e0) and the output 
parameter, i.e., Cc, based on the database utilized for our study is presented in Table 1. Furthermore, 
Figures 2–5 illustrate the distribution of these parameters using histograms.

3.2. Model Structure and Performance 

The LL and PL represent the two various states of the soil depending on its water content. The e0 
of  soil  represents  the  initial  ratio  of  the  volume  of  voids  to  the  solids.  Prediction  equations  for  Cc 
developed by previous studies (see Equation (1)) have clearly indicated that LL, PL, and e0 are the 
three main parameters that influence Cc [3-9]. Thus, these parameters were considered in the current 
study to develop a simplified prediction equation for Cc. The main motivation of developing such an 
equation was that determination of  LL, PL, and e0 is straightforward compared to performing any 
consolidation test that directly determines Cc. Therefore, the developed model is anticipated to result 
in  considerable  savings  in  terms  of  testing  time,  technician  costs,  and  laboratory  equipment.  It 
should be noted that LL, PL, and e0 are influenced by the natural water content of partially saturated 
soils, thus making the developed equation applicable to any saturated fine-grained soils [28,39,40]. 
Mathematically, the developed equation has the following structure:

showing that Cc is considered to be a function of LL, PL, and e0. In order to develop the GEP-based 
prediction  equation  for  Cc,  a  database  containing  108  data  points  was  developed.  Each  data  point 
corresponded  to  LL,  PL,  and  e0,  as  well  as  Cc,  for  a  particular  fine-grained  soil  sample. 
GeneXproTools 5.0 was used to develop the GEP-based prediction equation in MATLAB  [41]. The 
performances of the developed GEP models were evaluated using the coefficient of determination 
(R2), the root mean squared error (RMSE), and the mean average error (MAE) (21-23), by applying 
the following equations:

In these equations, hi and ti are measured and predicted output (Cc) values, respectively, for the 
ith  data  point.  Furthermore,  ℎ̅ i  and  𝑡̅ i  are  averages  of  the  measured  and  predicted  values, 
respectively, and n is the number of samples [28,29]. 

3.3. Model Development 

The  database  was  divided  into  two  subsets  in  order  to  avoid  an  overfitting  issue,  a  training 
subset and a validation subset. The GEP-based model was trained using the training subset, while 
the validation subset was used for validating purposes and  for avoiding overfitting [34]. The final 
model  (prediction  equation)  was  selected  based  on  model  simplicity  and  the  performances  of  the 
training and validation subsets. Performance criteria were based on the highest R2 and lowest RMSE 
and MAE of the training and validation subsets. After training, the candidate models were applied 
to  the  unseen  validation  subset  to  ensure  their  good  performance.  The  proportion  of  training  to 
validation subset sizes with respect to the whole data is commonly selected as 60%–75% and 25%–
40%, respectively. In the current study, 75% (81 data points) and 25% (27 data points) of total data 
points were assigned to the training subset and validation subset, respectively. 

The  GEP  algorithm  was  executed  several  times  with  a  varied  combination  of  influential 
parameters  in  order  to  identify  the  best  model.  This  process  was  based  on  values  suggested  by 
previous  works  [31,32,34].  Table  2  includes  the  parameters  of  various  runs.  Reasonably  large 
numbers were considered for size of population and generations to guarantee that optimal models 
were achieved. In the developed GEP-based model, individuals were identified and transferred into 
further  generations  based  on  a  fitness  evaluation  carried  out  with  roulette  wheel  sampling, 
considering  elitism.  Such  an  evaluation  could  guarantee  successful  cloning  of  the  best  individual. 
Furthermore, variations in the population were carried out through genetic operators on the chosen 
chromosomes, including crossover, mutation, and rotation [10]. 

In every GEP-based  model,  the  values of  the  setting  parameters  have  a significant impact on 
model performance. These parameters include the quantity of genes and chromosomes, in addition 
to a gene’s head size and the rate of genetic operators. Since minor information was available about 
GEP  parameters  in  the  literature,  appropriate  settings  were  selected  based  on  a  trial  and  error 
scheme (see Table 2).

Furthermore, to facilitate the development of the GEP-based model, the following closed-form 

equation was developed and utilized:

GEP-based model performance in terms of R2, RMSE, and MAE for these sets. Smith [42] has stated

that for a coefficient of determination of |R|> 0.8, a strong correlation exists between measured and 
predicted values. Based on Table 3, the developed GEP-based model had a high R2 for the training 
subset, validation subset, and entire dataset. In addition, the model exhibited a relatively low RMSE 
and MAE for all of these sets.

In  this  section,  the  performance  of  the  developed  GEP-based  model  is  evaluated  based  on 
various statistical parameters found in the literature. These statistical parameters, along with their 
acceptance criteria, are presented in Table 4. The parameters used in this table are all as previously 
defined. Furthermore, the developed model was evaluated based on these statistical parameters, and 
the results are presented in this table. As can be seen in Table 4, the developed model met all of the 
criteria  for  additional  statistical  parameters,  revealing  the  decent  performance  of  the  proposed 
model.

Table 5 presents a comparison of the developed GEP-based model to previous models found in 
the  literature.  The  previous  models  consist  of  either  regression-based  equations  or  robust  AI 
methods,  such  as  MEP,  ANNs,  or  MGGP.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  these  AI  methods  do  not 
provide  any  closed-form  solution.  The  AI  methods  had  a  relatively  high  R2,  mainly  due  to  their 
black-box nature of connecting inputs and outputs. Nevertheless, the developed GEP-based model 
had  a  higher  R2  compared  to  the  existing  AI  methods.  However,  MEP,  ANNs,  and  MGGP  had  a 
lower error in terms of RMSE and MAE. 

Based on Table 5, the developed GEP-based model outperformed the regression models, since 
the  regression models considered only  a small quantity of  base functions. Therefore, such models 
could  not  be  used  for  the  complex  interactions  of  soil  parameters  (i.e.,  LL,  PL,  and  e0)  and  Cc. 
However,  the  developed  GEP-based  model  considered  a  variety  of  base  functions  and  their 
combination  in  order  to  achieve  a  closed-form  equation  with  high  performance.  The  developed 
GEP-based  model  directly  considered  the  experimental  data  with  no  prior  assumptions.  In  other 
words, contrary to traditional regression models, GEP did not assume any predefined shape for the 
solution equation. The high values of R2 presented in Table 5 indicate that the developed GEP-based 
model was very successful at fitting the measured Cc to the input parameters of LL, PL, and e0.

5. Conclusions 

Cc is a significant parameter in determining the settlement of fine-grained soil layers subjected 
to  loads,  such  as  in  buildings,  vehicles,  and  infrastructure.  If  Cc  is  not  estimated  accurately,  soil 
settlement  is  not  predicted  accurately.  Thus,  determining  Cc  is  of  significant  importance  in 
settlement  calculations.  However,  measuring  Cc  using  the  traditional  oedometer  test  method  is 
time-consuming,  needs  skilled  technicians,  and  requires  special  laboratory  equipment.  Therefore, 
the  estimation  of  Cc  using  other  parameters  of  fine-grained  soils,  such  as  LL,  PL,  and  e0,  would 
eliminate  the  time  and  costliness  associated  with  the  oedometer  test.  In  this  study,  GEP  was 
employed to develop a model for estimating Cc using LL, PL, and e0. Here, 108 data points containing 
Cc, LL, PL,  and  e0  were used to train  and  validate  the model. The model was developed based on 
tuned  calibration  parameters  using  trial  and  error.  A  closed-form  solution  was  derived  from  the

developed GEP-based model, which is anticipated to aid geotechnical researchers in determining Cc 
with considerable savings in associated time and costs. This closed-form equation for predicting Cc 
was employed to develop surface charts to predict Cc based on LL and PL for a certain e0. 

The  performance  of  the  developed  GEP-based  model  was  evaluated  using  the  coefficient  of 
determination  (R2)  and  two  error  measures,  namely  root  mean  squared  error  (RMSE)  and  mean 
average error (MAE). The R2 values were 0.8231, 0.8603, and 0.8320 for the training subset, validation 
subset,  and  entire  dataset,  respectively.  In  addition,  RMSE  was  0.0269,  0.0237,  and  0.0262  for  the 
training subset, validation subset, and entire dataset, respectively. A high R2 and low error indicated 
the  highly  acceptable  performance  of  the  GEP-based  model.  Additional  performance  measures 
found  in  the  literature  were  employed  to  further  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  developed 
GEP-based  model.  This  evaluation  revealed  that  the  model  had  a  decent  performance  based  on 
additional performance measures. 

Contrary  to  the  classical  models  for  estimating  Cc,  such  as  regression  models,  the  developed 
GEP-based  model  revealed  highly  nonlinear  behavior  and  included  a  complex  combination  of 
influential  input  parameters  (i.e.,  LL,  PL,  and  e0).  In  general,  Cc  was  positively  correlated  with  e0. 
Furthermore, LL and e0 had a higher influence on the estimation of Cc compared to PL. A comparison 
of the developed model to previous models in the literature revealed its good performance, which 
guarantees the use of this GEP-based model in practical applications.
