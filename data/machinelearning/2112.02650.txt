ABSTRACT
Variable names are critical for conveying intended program behav-
ior. Machine learning-based program analysis methods use variable
name representations for a wide range of tasks, such as suggesting
new variable names and bug detection. Ideally, such methods could
capture semantic relationships between names beyond syntactic
similarity, e.g., the fact that the names average and mean are simi-
lar. Unfortunately, previous work has found that even the best of
previous representation approaches primarily capture “relatedness”
(whether two variables are linked at all), rather than “similarity”
(whether they actually have the same meaning).

We propose VarCLR, a new approach for learning semantic rep-
resentations of variable names that effectively captures variable
similarity in this stricter sense. We observe that this problem is an
excellent fit for contrastive learning, which aims to minimize the
distance between explicitly similar inputs, while maximizing the
distance between dissimilar inputs. This requires labeled training
data, and thus we construct a novel, weakly-supervised variable
renaming dataset mined from GitHub edits. We show that VarCLR
enables the effective application of sophisticated, general-purpose
language models like BERT, to variable name representation and
thus also to related downstream tasks like variable name similarity
search or spelling correction. VarCLR produces models that sig-
nificantly outperform the state-of-the-art on IdBench, an existing
benchmark that explicitly captures variable similarity (as distinct
from relatedness). Finally, we contribute a release of all data, code,
and pre-trained models, aiming to provide a drop-in replacement for
variable representations used in either existing or future program
analyses that rely on variable names.

1 INTRODUCTION
Variable names convey key information about code structure and
developer intention. They are thus central for code comprehen-
sion, readability, and maintainability [7, 46]. A growing array of

automatic techniques make use of variable names in the context
of tasks like but not limited to bug finding [64, 68] or specifica-
tion mining [88]. Beyond leveraging the information provided by
names in automated tools, recent work has increasingly attempted
to directly suggest good or improved names, such as in reverse
engineering [35, 45] or refactoring [3, 5, 52].

Developing (and evaluating) such automated techniques (or
name-based analyses [75]) relies in large part on the ability to model
and reason about the relationships between variable names. For con-
creteness, consider an analysis for automatically suggesting names
in decompiled code. Given a compiled program (such that variable
names are discarded) that is then decompiled (resulting in generic
names like a1,a2), a renaming tool seeks to replace the generic
decompiler-provided identifiers with more informative variable
names for the benefit of reverse engineers aiming to understand it.
Good names in this context are presumably closely related to the
names used in the original program (before the developer-provided
names were discarded). A variable originally named max, for exam-
ple, and then decompiled to a2, should be replaced with a name at
least close to max, like maximum. Modeling this relationship well is
key for both constructing and evaluating such analyses.

Accurately capturing and modeling these relationships is dif-
ficult. A longstanding approach has used syntactic difference —
like various measures of string edit distance — to estimate the re-
lationship between two variables (such as for spellchecking [18]).
However, syntactic distance is quite limited in capturing underly-
ing name semantics. For example, the pairs (minimum, maximum) and
(minimum, minimal) are equidistant syntactically — with a Leven-
shtein distance of two — but maximum and minimum are antonyms.
More recent work has sought to instead encode variable name
semantics using neural network embeddings, informing a variety of
name-based analyses [29, 65, 78]. Unfortunately, although state-of-
the-art techniques for variable name representation better capture
relatedness, they still struggle to accurately capture variable name
similarity, in terms of how interchangeable two names are. Vari-
ables may be related for a variety of reasons. While maximum and
minimum are highly related, they certainly cannot be substituted
for one another in a code base. minimum and minimal, on the other
hand, are both related and very similar. In recent work, Wainakh
et al. [75] presented a novel dataset, IdBench, based on a human
survey on variable similarity and interchangeability, and used it to
evaluate state-of-the-art embedding approaches. They empirically

established that there remains significant room for improvement
in terms of capturing similarity rather than merely relatedness.

In this paper, we formulate the variable semantic representation
learning problem as follows: given a set of variable data, learn a
function 𝑓 that maps a variable name string to a low-dimensional
dense vector that can be used in a variety of tasks (like the types of
name-based analyses discussed above). To be useful, such a map-
ping function should effectively encode similarity, i.e., whether
two variables have the same meaning. That is, 𝑓 (minimum) and
𝑓 (minimal) should be close to one another. Importantly, however,
the function should also ensure that variable names that are not
similar (regardless of relatedness!) are far from one another. That
is, 𝑓 (minimum) and 𝑓 (maximum) should be distant.

Our first key insight is that this problem is well suited for a
contrastive-learning approach [14, 30, 63, 82]. Conceptually, con-
trastive learning employs encoder networks to encode instances
(in this task, variables) into representations (i.e., hidden vectors),
with a goal of minimizing the distance between (the representation
of) similar instances and maximizing the distance between (the rep-
resentation of) dissimilar instances. Contrastive learning requires
as input a set of “positive pair” examples—of similar variables, in
our case—for training.

Our second key insight is that we can construct a suitable weakly-
supervised dataset of examples of similar variables by taking ad-
vantage of large amounts of source control information on GitHub.
Following the definition of “similarity” from prior work [60, 75],
we consider two variable names are similar if they have the same
meaning, or are interchangeable. We therefore automatically mine
source control edits to identify historical changes where developers
renamed a variable but did not otherwise overly modify the code
in which it was used. Although potentially noisy, this technique
matches an intuitive understanding of variable name similarity in
terms of interchangeability, and allows for the collection of a large
dataset, which we call GitHubRenames.

Finally, we observe that the variable semantic representation
learning problem requires more powerful neural architectures than
word2vec-based approaches [8, 59, 75].1 Such approaches are
limited both empirically (as Wainakh et al. showed) and conceptu-
ally; note for example that they cannot capture component order-
ing, such as the difference between idx_to_word and word_to_idx.
Meanwhile, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) [9, 20, 67] based
on the powerful Transformer architecture [74] have achieved the
state-of-the-art on a wide range of natural language processing
tasks, including text classification [20], question answering and
summarization [48], and dialog systems [1]. PLMs tailored specif-
ically for programming languages such as CodeBERT [22] and
Codex [12] are useful in a variety of tasks such as code completion,
repair, and generation [12, 55], though not yet for variable name rep-
resentation. Encouragingly, previous work shows that contrastive
learning can strongly improve BERT sentence embeddings for tex-
tual similarity tasks [24]. And, contrastive learning has been shown
to benefit from deeper and wider network architectures [13].

1word2vec [59] is an embedding algorithm based on the distributional hypothesis,
which assumes words that occur in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings.

We combine these insights to produce VarCLR, a novel machine
learning method based on contrastive learning for learning general-
purpose variable semantic representation encoders. In VarCLR, the
contrastive learning element serves as a pre-training step for a tradi-
tional encoder. While powerful modern approaches like CodeBERT
perform poorly on the variable representation problem off-the-shelf,
we show that VarCLR-trained models dramatically outperform the
previous state-of-the-art on capturing both variable similarity and
relatedness. VarCLR is designed to be general to a variety of useful
downstream tasks; we demonstrate its effectiveness for both the ba-
sic variable similarity/relatedness task (using the IdBench dataset
as a gold standard baseline) as well as for variable similarity search,
and spelling error correction.

To summarize, our main contributions are as follows:
(1) VarCLR, a novel method based on contrastive learning that
learns general-purpose variable semantic representations
suitable for a variety of downstream tasks.

(2) A new weakly supervised dataset, GitHubRenames, for bet-
ter variable representation learning consisting of similar
variable names collected from real-world GitHub data.
(3) Experimental results demonstrating that VarCLR’s models
significantly outperform state-of-the-art representation ap-
proaches on IdBench, an existing benchmark for evaluat-
ing variable semantic representations. These results further
substantiate the utility of more sophisticated models like
CodeBERT, with larger model capacity, in place of the pre-
vious word2vec-based methods for learning variable rep-
resentations, while showing that the contrastive learning
pre-training step is critical to enabling the effectiveness of
such models.

(4) Experimental results that demonstrate that both unsuper-
vised pre-training and our proposed weakly-supervised con-
trastive pre-training are indispensable parts for advancing
towards the state-of-the-art, for the former takes advantage
of greater data quantity by leveraging a huge amount of
unlabeled data, while the latter takes advantage of better
data quality with our new GitHubRenames dataset.

Finally, we contribute a release of all data, code, and pre-trained
models, aiming to provide a drop-in replacement for variable repre-
sentations used in either existing or future program analyses that
rely on variable names.2

2 PROBLEM DOMAIN
Variable names critically communicate developer intent and are
thus increasingly used by a variety of automated techniques as a
central source of information. Such techniques increasingly rely on
machine learning and embedding-based representation approaches
to encode variable name meaning for these purposes. However,
recent work [75] shows that while neural embeddings based on
techniques like word2vec do a better job of capturing relation-
ships between variables than syntactic edit distance does, they
still struggle to capture actual variable similarity in terms of their
interchangeability. In this paper, we show that this problem is
amenable to a contrastive learning approach, enabling accurate
general-purpose representations of variable name semantics.

VarCLR: Variable Semantic Representation Pre-training via Contrastive Learning

ICSE 2022, May 21-29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

We define the variable semantic representation learning problem
as follows: given a collection of suitable variable data, learn a func-
tion 𝑓 that maps a variable name string to a low-dimensional dense
vector that can be used to benefit various downstream tasks (like
variable similarity scoring in the simplest case, or arbitrarily com-
plex name-based analyses). A good mapping function 𝑓 for variable
name representations should:

(1) Capture similarity. 𝑓 should encode similar names such that
they are close to one another. Two names are similar when
they have similar or generally interchangeable meanings,
like avg and mean. This is especially important for variables
that are related but not similar, such as maximum and minimum.
Indeed, antonyms are often closely related and can appear
in similar contexts (max and min for example may be used
together in loops finding extrema).

(2) Capture component ordering and importance. Variables often
consist of component words or sub-words. We observe that
the order of such components can affect meaning. For ex-
ample, idx_to_word and word_to_idx contain the same sub-
words, but have different meanings. Moreover, the impor-
tance of different component words in a variable can be differ-
ent and the importance of the same word can vary between
variables. For example, in variables onAdd and onRemove, on
is less important, while add and remove are more important.
In turnOn and turnOff, on and off are more important than
turn. A good mapping function 𝑓 should be able to cap-
ture these differences, instead of treating variables as an
unordered bag of sub-words.

(3) Transferability. The representation should be general-purpose
and usable for a wide range of tasks. Benefits of a transfer-
able, shared representation include the ability to (1) improve
accuracy on unsupervised or data-scarce tasks, where it can
be hard to obtain high-quality variable representations from
scratch, and (2) for complex tasks consisting of many sub-
tasks, make better use of labeled data from multiple sub-tasks
via multi-task learning.

This formulation of the problem motivates our use of contrastive
learning, which is an effective way to learn similarity from labeled
data. Conceptually, given an encoder network 𝑓𝜃 and a set of similar
“positive pairs”, contrastive learning returns a new encoder that at-
tempts to locate similar “positive pair” instances closer together and
dissimilar “negative pair” instances farther apart. In practice, this
can be accomplished by re-training the original encoder on a new
pre-training task: instance discrimination [82]. Instance discrim-
ination casts the contrastive learning problem as a classification
problem where only the “positive pair” instances are equivalent.
Rather than explicitly adjusting the distances between points, the
encoder’s parameters are trained to optimize its performance at
discriminating similar instance from dissimilar instances. This nat-
urally adjusts the parameters of the encoder such that similar in-
stances are moved closer together (and vice-versa for dissimilar
instances). The actual output of the contrastive learning process is
a new encoder 𝑓𝜃 ′ that is identical to the original encoder in neural
architecture, but has a different set of parameters 𝜃 ′ resulting from
training on the instance discrimination task.

Figure 1: Conceptual overview of VarCLR.

There are two central design choices in applying contrastive
learning, however. First, Which neural architectures should be used
for 𝑓𝜃 ? This is usually decided by the problem domain in question.
For example, in computer vision, ResNet [31] for learning image
representations [13, 30, 63]; in natural language processing, Simple
word embedding or BERT [20, 53] for learning sentence represen-
tations [24, 80]; and in data mining, Graph Neural Network [44]
for learning graph representations [66]. Second, How to construct
similar (positive) and dissimilar (negative) training pairs? Unsuper-
vised data augmentation like cropping or clipping has been used to
create different “views” of the same image as similar pairs in im-
age processing [63, 72]; word dropout can augment text sentences
for natural language processing [24]. For supervised contrastive
learning, positive pairs can be created from labeled datasets di-
rectly [24], or via sampling instances from the same class [42]. Note
that dissimilar pairs typically need not be explicitly defined. Instead,
in-batch negatives [63] can be sampled from instance pairs that are
not explicitly labeled as positive.

The choice of similar instances is very important, as it influences
the learned similarity function and impacts downstream effective-
ness [73]. For example, consider how training can lead to uninten-
tional properties of a learned similarity function for word2vec. At
a high level, word2vec [59] can be viewed as a form of unsuper-
vised contrastive learning. It employs a word embedding layer as
the encoder, and treats words co-occurring in the context window
as similar pairs, while treating other words in the dictionary as
dissimilar ones.3 Due to its choice of “similar instances”, it learns
more of association (or relatedness) between words, instead of simi-
larity in terms of how interchangeable two words are. For example,
word2vec embeddings of cohyponym words such as red, blue,
white, green are very close. While this might not be a problem
in NLP applications, word2vec leads to unsatisfactory behavior
when applied to variable names [75], e.g., by identifying minLength
and maxLength as similar.

3 METHOD
Figure 1 shows a high-level conceptual overview of VarCLR, our
framework for learning effective semantic representations of vari-
able names. VarCLR consists of a contrastive pre-training phase
that takes two inputs: (1) a positive set of similar variable name
pairs, and (2) an input encoder. The set of similar variables is crucial

3We leave out the minor difference that word2vec produces two sets of embeddings,
while contrastive learning usually uses a unified representation.

for VarCLR’s performance. We thus produce GitHubRenames, a
novel weakly-supervised dataset consisting of positive examples
of similar variables by examining large amounts of source code
history available from GitHub (Section 3.1). These variables must
be suitably tokenized for encoding in a way that captures and
retains relevant information (Section 3.2), both for pre-training
and for downstream tasks. VarCLR also takes an input encoder
𝑓𝜃 with learnable parameters 𝜃 (Section 3.3). This encoder is then
trained using contrastive learning (Section 3.4). The output of our
framework is a contrastively-trained VarCLR encoder that con-
verts tokenized variables into semantic representations suitable for
a variety of tasks and name-based analyses, including similarity
scoring or spelling error correction, among others.

3.1 Similar variables: GitHubRenames
A high-level definition of “similarity” [60, 75], is the degree to which
two variables have the same meaning. Contrastive learning requires
positive examples for training, and thus we need a set of appropriate
positive pairs of similar variable names. As discussed in Section 2,
these need not be manually constructed. Although IdBench [75]
provides curated sets of human-judged “similar” variables, they are
too small for training purposes (the largest set, has 291 variable
pairs). This motivates an automated mechanism for constructing
training data, with the added benefit that we need not be concerned
about training and testing on the same dataset (as we use IdBench
for evaluation).

Instead, we observe that one way to define variable similarity is
to consider the degree to which two variables are explicitly inter-
changeable in code (close to IdBench’s definition of “Contextual
similarity”). We therefore collect a weakly supervised dataset of
interchangeable variable names by mining source control version
histories for commits where variable names change. These variable
pairs are considered similar because they appear interchangeable
in the same code context.

Concretely, we built upon existing open-source dataset collection
code used to mine source control for the purpose of modeling
changes [84].4 Given a repository, this code mines all commits of
less than six lines of code where a variable is renamed. The intuition
is to look for commits that do not make large structural changes
that might correspond to a major change in a variable’s meaning.
We applied dataset collection to an expanded version of the list of
repositories used in ref [84], consisting of 568 C# projects.5 The
final GitHubRenames dataset contains 66,855 variable pairs, each
consisting of a variable name before and after a renaming commit.
The GitHubRenames dataset is only weakly supervised since
developers were not asked to label variable pairs explicitly. The
dataset may thus be noisy, and in particular we did not attempt to
filter out renames corresponding to bug fixes. Indeed, we note that
a number of pairs in GitHubRenames correspond to fixing spelling
mistakes (Section 4.4). Overall, however, we note that our method
transfers well to the IdBench validation set, and expect that more
data will only improve VarCLR’s effectiveness.

3.2 Input representation
A variable name as a text string must be preprocessed to be used
as input to a neural network encoder. We observe two interest-
ing aspects of variable names that inform our preprocessing. First,
variable names are often composed of multiple words with inter-
changeable case styles, e.g., max_iteration vs maxIteration. Sec-
ond, variable names are sometimes composed of short words or
abbreviations, without an underscore or uppercase to separate them.
e.g., filelist, sendmsg.

For the first problem, we apply a set of regex rules to canonicalize
variable names into a list of tokens, e.g., ["max", "iteration"].
The second problem is more challenging, and could cause Out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) problems. To solve this, we use the pre-trained
CodeBERT tokenizer [22], which is underlying a Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE) model [70] trained on a large code corpus based on token
frequencies. When encountering an unknown composite variable
name such as sendmsg, it is able to split it into subword tokens, e.g.,
["send", "##msg"], where "##" means this token is a suffix of the
previous word.

3.3 Encoders
Generally, a neural encoder takes the input sequence, and encodes
and aggregates information over the sequence to produce a hid-
den vector. That is, given a sequence of tokens 𝑣 = (𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑛)
corresponding to a tokenized variable name, an encoder outputs
a hidden vector 𝒉 ∈ R𝑑 , where 𝑑 is the dimension of the hidden
representation:

𝒉 = 𝑓𝜃 (𝑣),

(1)

𝑓𝜃 denotes the encoder with learnable parameters 𝜃 .

Note that VarCLR is applicable to any encoder with this form.
In this paper, we instantiate it specifically for Word Embedding
Averaging (VarCLR-Avg), the LSTM Encoder (VarCLR-LSTM), and
BERT (VarCLR-CodeBERT).

Word Embedding Averaging. Averaging the embeddings of input
tokens is a simple but effective way to represent a whole input
sequence, given sufficient data [80, 81]. Therefore, we consider this
as a simple baseline encoder. Formally, given the tokenized variable
name 𝑣 = (𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑛), 𝑣𝑖 ∈ V, and a word embedding lookup
table 𝐿𝜃 : V → R𝑑 :

𝒉 =

1
𝑛

𝑛
∑︁

𝑖=1

𝐿𝜃 (𝑣𝑖 ),

(2)

where V is the vocabulary, i.e., the collection of all tokens the
model can handle, 𝜃 ∈ R |V×𝑑 | is the learnable embedding matrix.
Although simple and efficient, this Word Embedding Averaging
encoder suffers from two issues: 1) Order. The averaging operator
discards word order information in the input sequence, and thus
poorly represents variable names where this order is important, e.g.,
idx_to_word and word_to_idx. 2) Token importance. An unweighted
average of word embeddings ignores the relative importance of
words in a variable name, as well as the fact that the importance of
a word can vary by context.

ize feed-forward neural networks to sequences. Given the tokenized

quence of hidden vectors (𝒉1, 𝒉2, . . . , 𝒉𝒏).

than previous models thanks to the multi-head self-attention mech-
anism, allowing for the model to be much wider and deeper with
more parameters. We therefore propose to use PLMs for programs
as our most powerful choice of variable name encoder.

where 𝑊 hx,𝑊 hh ∈ R𝑑×𝑑 are weight matrices, and 𝜃𝑒 is the embed-
ding matrix (as in Equation (2)). RNNs process the input sequence
by reading in one token 𝑣𝑡 at a time and combining it with the
past context ℎ𝑡 −1. This captures sequential order information. After
processing all input tokens, we can average the hidden states at
each step to output a representation of the original variable:

𝒉 =

𝑖=1

We use bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) mod-
els [34], a variant of RNNs widely used in natural language pro-
cessing. LSTMs introduce several new components, including the
input and forget gates, controlling how much information flows
from the current token, and how much to keep from past contexts,
respectively. This better handles the token importance problem by
dynamically controlling the weight of the input token at each step.

BERT. Transformer-based models [74] typically outperform LSTMs

and are considered to be the better architecture for many NLP tasks.
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), built upon Transformers, can
leverage massive amounts of unlabeled data and computational
resources to effectively tackle a wide range of natural language
processing tasks. Useful PLMs for programming languages include
CodeBERT [22] and Codex [12] PLMs not only capture compo-
nent ordering and token importance that LSTMs do, but provide
additional benefits: 1) BERT-based models are already pre-trained
with self-supervised objectives such as Masked Language Modeling
(MLM) [20] on a large amount of unlabeled data. It provides a good
initialization to the model parameters and improves the model’s
generalization ability, requiring fewer data to achieve satisfactory
performance [9]. 2) Transformer encoders are much more powerful

Effectiveness versus efficiency. Although BERT has the largest
model capacity of these encoders, it also requires higher computa-
tion cost for both training and inference, and suffers from a longer
inference latency. The trade-off posted between effectiveness and
efficiency can vary according to different downstream applications.
Therefore, we find it meaningful to compare all encoders in Var-
CLR. Different or better encoder models can be directly plugged
into the VarCLR framework in the future. We omit further interior
technical details of both LSTM and BERT models as they are beyond
the scope of this paper.

3.4 Contrastive Learning Pre-training
VarCLR implements the design choices for input data, variable tok-
enization, and input encoder in a contrastive learning framework.
Figure 2 provides an overview. Conceptually, contrastive learning
uses encoder networks to encode instances (in this task, variables)
into representations (i.e., hidden vectors), and aims to minimize the
distance between similar instances while maximizing the distance
between dissimilar instances.

Specifically, given a choice of encoder and set of labeled “positive
pairs” of variable names, we use instance discrimination [82] as
our pre-training task, and InfoNCE [63] as our learning objective.
Given a mini-batch of encoded and L2-normalized representations
of 𝐾 similar variable pairs (cid:8)(𝑣1,𝑖, 𝑣2,𝑖 )|𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝐾 (cid:9), we first encode
them to hidden representations:

𝒒𝒊 =

𝒌𝒊 =

𝑓𝜃 (𝑣1,𝑖 )
(cid:13)𝑓𝜃 (𝑣1,𝑖 )(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)2

where ∥ · ∥2 is ℓ2-norm, 𝑓𝜃 denotes the encoder. Then, we define
the InfoNCE loss as:

(cid:32)

LNCE (𝒒, 𝒌) = −E

log

𝑒𝒒𝒊

⊤𝒌𝒊/𝜏

(cid:205)𝐾

𝑗=1

𝑒𝒒𝒊

⊤𝒌𝒋 /𝜏

,

(7)

where 𝜏 is the temperature hyperparameter introduced by [82].
Intuitively, this objective encourages the model to discriminate the
corresponding similar instance 𝑣2,𝑖 of an instance 𝑣1,𝑖 from other
instances in the mini-batch 𝑣2,𝑗 . This learning objective is very
similar to the cross-entropy loss for classification tasks, while the
difference is that instead of a fixed set of classes, it treats each
instance as a distinct class. Following [26], we further make the
loss symmetric and minimize the following objective function:

L =

1
2

LNCE (𝒒, 𝒌) +

1
2

LNCE (𝒌, 𝒒) .

(8)

In our task, this objective encourages the encoder to push the
representations of a pair of similar variables to be close to each
other, so that they can be discriminated from other variables.

We refer to this process as pre-training in the sense that the
training is not intended for a specific task but is learning a general-
purpose variable representation.

4 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we evaluate VarCLR’s ability to train models for
variable representation along several axes. Section 4.1 addresses
setup, datasets, and baselines common to the experiments. Then, we
begin by addressing a central claim: How well do VarCLR models
encode variable similarity, as distinct from relatedness? We answer
this question by using pre-trained VarCLR models to compute
similarity (and relatedness, resp) scores between pairs of variables,
and evaluate the results on human-annotated gold standard ground
truth benchmark (Section 4.2).

Next, we evaluate VarCLR-trained models on two other down-
stream tasks, demonstrating transferability: variable similarity search
(Section 4.3), and variable spelling error correction (Section 4.4).

Finally, we conduct an ablation study (Section 4.5) looking at the
influence of training data size, pre-trained language models, and
pre-trained embeddings from unsupervised learning contribute to
VarCLR’s effectiveness.

4.1 Setup

Pre-training. For VarCLR-Avg and VarCLR-LSTM, we use the
Adam optimizer [43] with 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.999, 𝜖 = 1 × 10−8, a
learning rate of 0.001, and early stop according to the contrastive
loss on the validation set. We use a mini-batch size of 1024. The input
embedding and hidden representation dimensions are set to 768
and 150 respectively. we also initialize the embedding layer with the
CodeBERT pre-trained embedding layer. For VarCLR-CodeBERT,
we use the AdamW optimizer [54] with the same configuration and
learning rate, and a mini-batch size of 32. We use the BERT model
architecture [20] and initialize the model with pre-trained weights
from CodeBERT [22]. For all three methods, we apply gradient
norm clipping in the range [−1, 1], and a temperature 𝜏 of 0.05. A
summary of the hyper-parameters can be found along with our
data, code, and pre-trained models at https://bit.ly/2WIalaW.

Dataset. While we use the GitHubRenames for training Var-
CLR, we use the IdBench [75] dataset for evaluation.6 IdBench is
a benchmark specifically created for evaluating variable semantic
representations. It contains pairs of variables assigned relatedness
and similarity scores by real-world developers. IdBench consists
of three sub-benchmarks— IdBench-small, IdBench-medium, and
IdBench-large, containing 167, 247, 291 pairs of variables, respec-
tively. Ground truth scores for each pair of variable are assessed
by multiple annotators. Pairs with disagreement between anno-
tators exceeding a particular threshold are considered dissimilar;
the three benchmarks differ in the choice of threshold. The smaller
benchmark provides samples with higher inter-annotator agree-
ment, while the larger benchmark provides more samples with
commensurately lower agreement. The medium benchmark strikes
a balance. We describe customizations of the IdBench dataset to
particular tasks in their respective sections.

Baselines. We compare VarCLR models to the previous state-of-
the-art as presented in IdBench [75]. We reuse the baseline results
provided by the IdBench framework. The IdBench paper evaluates
a number of previous approaches as well as a new ensemble method
that outperforms them; we include as baselines a subset of those
previous techniques, and the ensemble method. Of the string dis-
tance/syntactic functions (still broadly used in various name-related
applications [51, 68]), we include Levenshtein Edit Distance (LV)
(the number of single-character edits required to transform one
string into the other); it performs in the top half of techniques
on scoring similarity, and is competitive with the other syntac-
tic distance metric [62] on relatedness. Of the embedding-based
single models, we include FastText CBOW (FT-cbow) and SG
(FT-sg) [8], extensions of word2vec that incorporate subword in-
formation, to better handle infrequent words and new words. These
were the best-performing embedding-based methods on both relat-
edness and similarity.

Finally, we include two combined models. IdBench [75] pro-
poses an ensemble method that combines the scores of all models
and variable features. For each pair in IdBench, the combined
model trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with all
other pairs, then applies the trained model to predict the score of
the left-out pair. Note that this approach is trained on the IdBench
benchmark itself and is not directly comparable to other methods.
For comparison, we add VarCLR-Avg, VarCLR-LSTM, VarCLR-
CodeBERT scores as additional input features to the combined
approach, and report the results for Combined-VarCLR.

4.2 Variable Similarity and Relatedness Scoring
Our central claim is that VarCLR is well-suited to capturing and
predicting variable similarity. Formally, given two variables 𝑢 and
𝑣, we obtain variable representations with pre-trained VarCLR
encoder 𝑓𝜃 ′ and compute the variable similarity score as the cosine

6The IdBench evaluation scripts were updated after publication, leading to minor
differences in evaluation scores. We use their latest code as of May 1st, 2021 to evaluate
the baselines and our models.

similarity between the two vectors:

𝒉𝒖, 𝒉𝒗 = 𝑓𝜃 ′ (𝑢), 𝑓𝜃 ′ (𝑣)

ˆ𝑠 (𝑢, 𝑣) =

𝒉𝒖 · 𝒉𝒗
∥𝒉𝒖 ∥2 ∥𝒉𝒗 ∥2

,

(9)

(10)

where ˆ𝑠 (𝑢, 𝑣) denotes the VarCLR’s predicted similarity score. Fol-
lowing IdBench [75], we then compare the similarity scores of
pre-trained VarCLR representations with human ground-truth sim-
ilarity scores by computing Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient
between them. This correlation coefficient falls in the range [-1,
1], where 1 indicates perfect agreement between the rankings; -1
indicates perfect disagreement; and 0 indicates no relationship.

Note that the VarCLR pre-training task is explicitly optimiz-
ing the distance between similar variable pairs. Thus, the variable
similarity scoring task only really evaluates the performance of
the pre-training itself. To more fully evaluate whether our method
leads to better representations that can transfer, we also evaluate
on the variable relatedness scoring task.

Results. Table 1 shows the models’ performance on the similarity
and relatedness tasks in terms of Spearman’s rank correlation with
ground truth. Table 1a shows that VarCLR-CodeBERT improves
over the previous state-of-the-art on all three IdBench benchmarks,
with an absolute improvement of 0.18 on IdBench-small and 0.13 on
IdBench-large compared to the previous best approach, FT-cbow.
This shows that VarCLR aligns much better with human develop-
ers’ assessment of variable similarity than any of the previously
proposed models. Interestingly, VarCLR-Avg also outperforms FT-
cbow by a large margin (+0.12 on IdBench-small). This suggests
that most of our gains do not come from the use of a more power-
ful encoder architecture such as BERT. Instead, we conclude that
the GitHubRenames dataset is effective at providing supervision
signals of variable similarity, and the contrastive learning objective
is effective. Although their architectures are very similar, VarCLR-
Avg outperforms FT-cbow.

That said, the improvements in VarCLR-CodeBERT (+0.06) and
VarCLR (+0.03) over VarCLR-Avg verify our assumption that pow-
erful models with larger representational capacity are necessary
for learning better variable representations, since they are able to
capture and encode more information (e.g., sequential order and
token importance) than the embedding averaging methods.

Table 1b shows that VarCLR also achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on IdBench in terms of relatedness prediction. It
surpasses the previous best by 0.07 on IdBench-small and 0.07
on IdBench-large. This is noteworthy because VarCLR training
does not explicitly optimize for relatedness. This suggests that the
VarCLR pre-training task learns better generic representations,
rather than overfitting to the target task (i.e., variable similarity).
This is very important, and supports our major contribution: By pre-
training for the similarity learning task on GitHubRenames with
a contrastive objective, VarCLR achieves better representations
which can be applied to general tasks.

4.3 Variable Similarity Search
We next evaluate our learned representations in the context of
a more applied downstream application: similar variable search.
Similar variable search identifies similar variable names in a set of

names given an input query. This can be useful for refactoring code,
or for assigning variables more readable names (e.g., replacing fd
with file_descriptor). For a given set of variables V and a pre-
trained VarCLR encoder 𝑓𝜃 ′, we compute representation vectors
K = {𝑓𝜃 ′ (𝑣)|𝑣 ∈ V}. For a query variable 𝑢, we find top-𝑘 similar
variables in V with the highest cosine similarity to 𝑓𝜃 ′ (𝑢).

To quantitatively evaluate effectiveness in finding similar vari-
ables, we created a new mini-benchmark VarSim from the original
IdBench benchmark. We select variable pairs which have human-
assessed similarity scores greater than 0.4 in IdBench. This leaves
us with 100 ‘similar’ variable pairs from all 291 variable pairs in the
IdBench-large benchmark. We use the variable collection provided
in IdBench containing 208,434 variables as the overall candidate
pool. We use Hit@K as our evaluation metric, computing the cosine
similarity of the representations of a query variable 𝑢 and all the
variables in the candidate pool. We select the top-K variables with

the highest similarity scores and check whether the corresponding
similar variable 𝑣 is in the top-K list. We choose K to be 1, 5, 10, 25,
50, 100, 250, 500, 1000.

Results. As shown in Figure 3a, VarCLR-CodeBERT achieves the
best similarity search performance, with 47% at K=100 and 76% at
K=1000, compared to FT-cbow (37% at K=100, 68% at K=1000). This
indicates that our method is effective at finding similar variables,
able to distinguish the most similar variable to the query vari-
able out of 200 distractors around 76% of the time.7 Interestingly,
VarCLR-Avg and VarCLR-LSTM are less effective at similarity
search than FT-cbow, even though they outperform FT-cbow by
a large margin in the similarity scoring task. Embedding-based
methods are still a strong baseline for variable similarity search.
However, contrastive methods still amplify the effectiveness of
unsupervised embedding methods.

Similarity scoring and similarity search are distinct tasks, and
so it is not unexpected that techniques will be equally effective
on both. For example, word2vec tends to put the embeddings
of similar rare words close to some common frequent word. This
behavior does not affect the similarity search effectiveness because
the rare words are able to find each other, and the frequent word is
close enough to its similar word than to these rare words. However,
this will hurt similarity scoring between the rare words and the
frequent variable, since they are actually not similar. In comparison,
VarCLR is able to avoid these kinds of scoring mistakes.

Case Study. We demonstrate our results qualitatively by choos-
ing the same set of variables used to demonstrate this task in the
IdBench paper, and displaying the comparative results in Figure 3a.
For space, we omit two of the variables (rows and count) in the
set; the two methods perform comparably (such as on substr). We
observe that the overall qualities of the two methods’ results are
similar. This is understandable since the gap between the two meth-
ods on variable similarity search is relatively small as shown in
Table 2.

7Since our Hit@1000 score in a candidate pool of size ∼200,000 is 76%. Although
inspecting the top 1000 may not be practical as an real-world application itself, it is
still an informative metric of the representation quality, and may indicate effectiveness
in other settings, e.g., a developer looking at the top 5 similar variables from 1,000
candidates, or using VarCLR as generate a large candidate pool as the first stage.

Meanwhile, it is worth noting that VarCLR-CodeBERT is bet-
ter at penalizing distractive candidates that are only related but
not similar. For example, for minText, VarCLR-CodeBERT ranks
minLengthText, minContent before maxText, while FT-cbow sug-
gests the opposite. For miny, VarCLR-CodeBERT ranks ymin, yMin,
minY as top-3, while FT-cbow suggests related but dissimilar vari-
ables such as minBy and minx. This provides additional evidence that
our method is able to better represent semantic similarity rather
than pure relatedness.

4.4 Variable Spelling Error Correction
Spelling Error Correction is a fundamental yet challenging task
in natural language processing [37]. We explore the possibility of
applying VarCLR models to perform spelling error correction on
variable names. If the representations of misspelled variable names
are close to their correct versions, corrections may be found via
nearest neighbor search. Fortunately, the GitHubRenames dataset
enables this goal, because a portion of renaming edits in GitHubRe-
names are actually correcting spelling errors in previous commits.
We can therefore reformulate this problem as a variable similarity
search task, since our method treats these misspelled names as
similar to their corrected versions.

We create a new synthetic variable spelling error correction
dataset, VarTypo, with 1023 misspelled variables and their cor-
rections. Specifically, we create this dataset by sampling variables
from the 208,434 variable pool from IdBench, and use the nlpaug8
package [56] to create misspelled variables from the correct ones.
We use KeyboardAug which simulates typo error according to
characters’ distance on the keyboard. This task is challenging be-
cause our method does not leverage any external dictionary or
hand-crafted spelling rules. Meanwhile, although string distance
functions such as Levenshtein distance can potentially perform
better, these functions require expensive one-by-one comparisons
between the query variable and every variable in the pool, which is
very time consuming, while our method uses GPU-accelerated ma-
trix multiplication to compute all cosine distances at once and can
potentially adopt an even more efficient vector similarity search li-
brary such as faiss. Therefore, we believe it is still an informative
benchmark for evaluating variable representations.

Results. Similar to variable similarity search, we evaluate the
effectiveness as the Hit@K score of using the representation of
misspelled variables to retrieve the corresponding correct variable.
As shown in Figure 3b, VarCLR can successfully correct the 29.4% of
the time at Top-1, and 73.6% of the time at Top-100. One interesting
observation we find is that in this task, the gap (-4.5% at Top-1
and -1.0% at Top-100) between VarCLR-Avg and the other two
powerful encoders is relatively small. It even outperforms VarCLR-
CodeBERT after K=25. One possible explanation is that fixing a
typo requires neither word sequential order or word importance
information, i.e., being able to model the variable as a sequence
instead of a bag of words does not benefit this task.

Case Study. For illustration, we randomly select misspelled vari-
able names and use our VarCLR to find the most similar correct
variable names. As shown in Table 3., our model is able to correct
some of the misspelled variables, including insertions, deletions,
and modifications, while failing to recover others. Notably, variable
names consisting of multiple words such as minSimilarity can be
corrected successfully.

4.5 Ablation Studies
So far we have demonstrated the importance of both contrastive
learning and sophisticated models like CodeBERT for VarCLR per-
formance. Here, perform ablation studies to measure the effect of
additional design decisions in VarCLR: of training data size, of using
pre-trained language models, and of using pre-trained embeddings
from unsupervised learning.

4.5.1 Effect of Data Size on Contrastive Pre-training. Pre-training
VarCLR requires weakly-supervised data scraped from public repos-
itories. Thus, we evaluate how much data is required to train an
effective model, to elucidate data collection costs. To evaluate this,
we train VarCLR-Avg, VarCLR-LSTM, VarCLR-CodeBERT on 0%,
0.1%, 1%, 3.16%, 10%, 21.5%, 46.4%, 100% percent of the full dataset,
measuring the similarity score on IdBench-medium.

Figure 4 shows the results. For all three VarCLR variants, training
data size has a significant positive effect on effectiveness. This is
especially true for VarCLR-CodeBERT, but performance flattens
and converges as training data size approaches 100%. This suggests
that GitHubRenames is of an appropriate size for this task.

Another interesting observation is that VarCLR-Avg outper-
forms VarCLR-LSTM with smaller amounts of training data. This
indicates the more powerful LSTM model does not surpass a simple
one until the data size reaches a critical threshold. This is likely

Figure 4: Effect of contrastive pre-training data size on learned Var-
CLR representations, evaluated on IdBench-medium.

because a more complex model has more parameters to train and re-
quires more data to reach convergence. With sufficient data, larger
models win, thanks to their representational capacity. This sug-
gests a caveat in applying representation learning models: it is
important to choose a model with an appropriate complexity given
the amount of available data, rather than defaulting to the best-
performing model overall.

4.5.2 Using a Pre-trained Language Model. Before contrastive pre-
training on GitHubRenames, VarCLR-CodeBERT is initialized
with a model (pre-)pre-trained on a large code corpus. The effect of
this pre-training is also illustrated in Figure 4. Although VarCLR-
CodeBERT has a much larger number of parameters, it outperforms
VarCLR-Avg and VarCLR-LSTM after contrastive pre-training on
only 1% of GitHubRenames. While this seems to contradict the
conclusion reached in the comparison between VarCLR-LSTM and
VarCLR-Avg, it displays the benefit of initialization with a pre-
trained model. Compared to VarCLR-LSTM, which contains ran-
domly initialized parameters that have to be trained from scratch,
VarCLR-CodeBERT parameters produce reasonable representa-
tions from the start. Therefore, it requires less data to converge,
and thanks to its large model capacity, ultimately outperforms the
other two variants by a large margin.

Despite the fast convergence, directly applying CodeBERT with-
out contrastive pre-training leads to poor performance (0.13 at
0% data). One possible reason is that CodeBERT was originally
trained for whole-program representations, and using it with vari-
able names as inputs leads to a problematic divergence from its
training data distribution.

4.5.3 Effect of Pre-trained CodeBERT Embeddings. Both VarCLR-
Avg and VarCLR-LSTM are initialized with the word embeddings
from CodeBERT before contrastive pre-training. To study the effect
of these pre-trained embeddings, we measure the Spearman’s cor-
relation coefficient of the similarity scores of the models modified
in two ways: one with randomly-initialized embeddings that is
then contrastively pre-trained (“Contrastive” in Table 4), and one
that is initialized with CodeBERT embeddings but not contrastively
pre-trained (“CodeBERT” in Table 4).

The results show that pre-trained CodeBERT embeddings are
essential to the performance of VarCLR-Avg and VarCLR-LSTM.
However, directly adopting the pre-trained embeddings alone is

still insufficient, especially for LSTMs. This implies that both un-
supervised pre-training and weakly supervised pre-training are
indispensable for useful variable representations: the former takes
advantage of data quantity by leveraging a huge amount of unla-
beled data, while the latter takes advantage of data quality using
the weakly supervised GitHubRenames dataset.

5 RELATED WORK

Variable Names and Representations. Variable names are impor-
tant for source code readability and comprehension [25, 46]. Be-
cause of this, there has been recent work focusing on automatically
suggesting clear, meaningful variable names for tasks such as code
refactoring [3, 5, 52] and reverse engineering [35, 45].

A common approach involves building prediction engines on
top of learned variable representations. Representation learning is
a common task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and these
techniques are often adapted to source code. Simpler approaches
model variable representations by applying word2vec [58] to
code tokens [8, 16, 59, 75], while more advanced techniques have
adapted neural network architectures [41] or pre-trained language
models [12]. Source code representation is a common enough task
that researchers have developed benchmarks specifically for vari-
able [75] and program representations [76].

Similarity and Relatedness. A fundamental concern with existing
variable representations and suggestion engines is the difference be-
tween “related” and “similar” variables [60, 75]. “Related” variables
reference similar core concepts without concern for their precise
meaning, while “similar” variables are directly interchangeable. For
example, minWeight and maxWeight are related but not similar, while
avg and mean are both. Unlike state-of-the-art techniques, which
only model relatedness, VarCLR explicitly optimizes for similarity
by adapting contrastive learning techniques from NLP and com-
puter vision research. In NLP, systems are often designed to focus
on text relatedness [10, 23, 85], similarity [32], or both [2]. While
document search might only be concerned with relatedness [23]
similarity is particularly important in systems designed for para-
phrasing documents [79, 81].

VarCLR relies on contrastive learning to optimize for similarity.
Contrastive learning is particularly useful for learning visual repre-
sentations without any supervision data [11, 13, 14, 26, 30, 72, 82],

but has also been used for NLP [61]. Recent work has applied con-
trastive learning to the pre-training of language models to learn
text representations [17] and, similar to our task, learn sentence
embeddings for textual similarity tasks [24]. Contrastive learning
has also been used for code representation learning [36] where
source-to-source compiler transformation is applied for generating
different views of a same program. Different from this work, we
focus on learning representations for variable names, and leverage
additional data from GitHub for better supervision.

String similarity and spelling errors. Efficient string similarity
search remains an active research area [6, 19, 49, 87]. Most of these
methods can be categorized as sparse retrieval methods, focusing
on distance functions on the original string or n-grams. These al-
gorithms depend on the lexical overlap between strings and thus
cannot capture the similarity between variables pairs such as avg
and mean. More recently, dense retrieval methods have been shown
effective in NLP tasks [39, 47]. These methods perform similarity
search in the space of learned representations, so that sequences
with similar meanings but low lexical overlap can be found. Mean-
while, extremely efficient similarity search frameworks for dense
vectors such as faiss [38] can be applied. VarCLR introduces the
concept of dense retrieval into the variable names domain, enabling
more effective and efficient finding of a list of candidates that are
similar to a given variable name.

Neural models for spelling error correction usually require par-
allel training data which are hard to acquire in practice [28, 86].
Recent work adopts different mechanisms to create synthetic paral-
lel data, including noise injection [37], and back-translation mod-
els [27]. We leave a detailed comparison to future work, but note
that VarCLR shows promise without expensive training data.

Name- and Machine Learning-based Program Analyses. Our down-
stream tasks are examples of program analyses based on infor-
mation gathered with machine learning (ML). Name-based based
program analyses predicated on machine learning have been used
in many contexts. In the context of code modification, they have
been used for variable name suggestion from code contexts [5],
method and class name rewriting [52] and generation [4], code
generation directly from docstrings [12], and automated program
repair [15, 77]. They have also been used for type inference from
natural language information [57, 83], detecting bugs [40, 64, 65, 68],
and detecting vulnerabilities [29]. VarCLR can serve as a drop-in
pre-training step for such techniques, enabling more effective use
of the semantic information contained in variable names for a wide
range of such analyses.

6 DISCUSSION
In this paper, we study variable representation learning, a problem
with significant implications for machine learning and name-based
program analyses. We present a novel method based on contrastive
learning for pre-training variable representations. With our new
weakly-supervised GitHubRenames dataset, our method enables
the use of stronger encoder architectures in place of word2vec-
based methods for this task, leading to better generalized repre-
sentations. Our experiments show that VarCLR greatly improves
representation quality not only in terms of variable similarity, but

VarCLR: Variable Semantic Representation Pre-training via Contrastive Learning

also for other downstream tasks. While these downstream tasks may
not be immediately practical themselves, our approach is promising
as a drop-in pre-training solution for other variable name-based
analysis tasks, which we hope others will attempt in future work.
For example, VarCLR can replace the the word2vec-CBOW embed-
dings used in a name-based bug detector [64], or the n-gram based
language model used as a similarity scoring function for name sug-
gestion [3]. Existing dictionary-based IDE spell-checkers may also
benefit from using VarCLR to rank suggestions.

We note limitations and possible threats in our study. Our dataset
is automatically constructed from git commits from GitHub, and
likely contains noise that can harm contrastive learning perfor-
mance [50]. However, our results show that despite this noise, our
models transfer well, and our evaluation is based on an entirely
distinct test set. Knowledge distillation and self-training meth-
ods [21, 33] such as momentum distillation [50] can be applied
to deal with the noise in weak supervision data [50, 71].

In this work, we applied VarCLR exclusively to unsupervised
downstream tasks. Fine-tuning VarCLR models is likely to enable
significant performance improvements for more complicated tasks,
like natural variable name suggestion [3]. Beyond constructing
similar variable names, it is also conceptually possible to construct
similar pairs of larger code snippets from git diffs describing patches.
Applying contrastive learning on these pairs can potentially im-
prove CodeBERT code representation and understanding, which
could benefit tasks well beyond variable similarity, such as code
search. Finally, we used instance discrimination [82] to guide our
contrastive learning approach, with promising results. This sug-
gests that more advanced contrastive learning methods such as
MoCo [30], BYOL [26], SwAV [11] be adapted to this task for better
representation learning in general.
