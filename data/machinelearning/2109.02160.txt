Abstract

In this article, we propose a systematic approach for ﬁre station location planning. We develop
machine learning models, based on Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting, for demand
prediction and utilize the models further to deﬁne a generalized index to measure quality of ﬁre
service in urban settings. Our model is built upon spatial data collected from multiple diﬀerent
sources. Eﬃcacy of proper facility planning depends on choice of candidates where ﬁre stations
can be located along with existing stations, if any. Also, the travel time from these candidates to
demand locations need to be taken care of to maintain ﬁre safety standard. Here, we propose a
travel time based clustering technique to identify suitable candidates. Finally, we develop an opti-
mization problem to select best locations to install new ﬁre stations. Our optimization problem
is built upon maximum coverage problem, based on integer programming. We further develop a
two-stage stochastic optimization model to characterize the conﬁdence in our decision outcome.
We present a detailed experimental study of our proposed approach in collaboration with city of
Victoria Fire Department, MN, USA. Our demand prediction model achieves true positive rate of
80% and false positive rate of 20% approximately. We aid Victoria Fire Department to select a
location for a new ﬁre station using our approach. We present detailed results on improvement
in the city of Victoria.

1 Introduction

Urban ﬁres adversely aﬀect the socio-economic
growth and ecosystem health of any community.
In 2019, the National Fire Protection Associa-
tion (NFPA) reported an estimated loss of $14.8
billion and 3700 civilian ﬁre deaths in the U.S.

[1]. According to the report, on average, a ﬁre
department responded to a ﬁre incident every
24 seconds and in total, local ﬁre departments
responded to an estimated 1.3 million ﬁres. Thus,
building a safe community equipped with ade-
quate ﬁre safety measures is one of the most

essential and challenging tasks of any ﬁre depart-
ment and local government. However, it is very
diﬃcult to quantify the measure of safety, which
in-turn results into complexity in determining if
additional ﬁre stations are required to be installed.
This decision must be substantiated with all neces-
sary spatio-temporal data, gathered from various
diﬀerent sources, such as accurate details of histor-
ical emergency incidents from the ﬁre department,
future patterns of land use from local government,
parcel information from geographic information
system (GIS) (maintained by both US Census
Bureau and local authorities) and demographic
information from US Census Bureau. Combining
all of this information together is a demanding
task, due to diﬀerences in storage architectures
across diﬀerent sources. For example, the address
of a real property is documented with diﬀer-
ent abbreviations and acronyms in diﬀerent data
sources, which makes the task of joining the data
sets very diﬃcult. Also, the accuracy of infor-
mation on historical ﬁre incidents is poor and
exacerbated by incompleteness. A few examples
include address mismatches, missing dates, and
missing timestamps. Further, even if the require-
ment can be empirically justiﬁed using historical
spatio-temporal data, determination of locations
for new facilities is a demanding task which must
be strategically chosen based on performance of
the existing facilities as well as future community
growth and ﬁre risk projections. Such prediction
of future service demand is very diﬃcult due to
its dependency on many diﬀerent underlying fac-
tors. Moreover, correlation between the predictive
features makes the task even more challenging.
We emphasize that quantifying public safety mea-
sures, and embedding it to devise a systematic
approach to locate new ﬁre stations is limited
in existing literature. Moreover, the eﬃcacy of
such approaches from a data-mining perspective,
including both conﬁdential and publicly available
dataset, is unexplored in existing works.

To this end, we provide an approach that uti-
lizes both temporal and spatial data to select
locations for future ﬁre stations in urban settings.
Our methodology uses a Random Forest [2] and
Extreme Gradient Boosting [3] machine learning
models and a Density-based spatial clustering of
applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm [4].
For our experimental case study, we partnered

with City of Victoria Fire Department (VFD),
MN, USA. We apply our proposed methodology
to select the location of a future ﬁre station for
VFD. Note that our approach is not speciﬁc to
VFD and can be used to analyze candidate loca-
tions for any urban area. The main contributions
of this article are summarized below:

(1) Predictive demand model and service
quality assessment: We propose two machine
learning (ML) models, based on Random Forest
(RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
to predict future service demand of urban areas
from spatial data. We present a detailed perfor-
mance comparison between the models to choose
the superior one. The chosen ML model is utilized
to deﬁne a generalized service quality index (SQI)
that measures the quality of service provided by
existing ﬁre stations at any demand point. We
propose to use the SQI as a new national ﬁre ser-
vice standard to assess the performance of any ﬁre
facility, which can be tailored to a speciﬁc local-
ity. We also present a travel time based DBSCAN
algorithm to identify candidate locations for new
facilities. Our proposed methodology can be used
to predict and to analyze the performance of any
ﬁre department to improve quality of service.

(2) Optimization model for facility loca-
tion selection: We propose an optimization
model, based on SQI estimates, to select future
ﬁre stations. Our optimization model accounts for
spatial coverage, service prioritization and service
redundancy, thus presenting an end-to-end strate-
gic approach for ﬁre station location selection.
Further, we propose a two-stage stochastic opti-
mization model utilizing our demand prediction
model and travel-time base DBSCAN algorithm.
While the SQI-based optimization model estab-
lishes the utility of our proposed service quality
index to be used as a new standardized index, the
stochastic optimization model establishes the con-
ﬁdence in the decision outcome of our proposed
models, thus providing a comprehensive overview
of the merits of ﬁre station location selection
methodology.

(3) Impact on the city of Victoria Fire
Department: The work is done in collabora-
tion with Victoria Fire Department (VFD). VFD
utilizes the detailed performance analysis of the
existing ﬁre station to properly allocate resources
to improve the quality of service. It can also help
VFD to identify properties and locations which

require special attention in terms of ﬁre safety
measures. The predictive models and the facil-
ity location study are used by VFD for crafting
the initial proposal of the new ﬁre station to be
approved by the local authorities.

2 Related Work

Systematic approaches for selecting sites for criti-
cal infrastructure have been widely studied in the
literature [5]. In [6], a bi-objective spatial opti-
mization model is proposed to locate an urban ﬁre
station by minimizing the number of stations to be
sited along with their distances from the service
demand clusters to ensure a required area cover-
age. A similar approach is applied in [7] to prove
the eﬃcacy of such algorithms in guiding local
government authorities to select a location for a
new ﬁre station. A multi-criteria decision mak-
ing approach for planning of emergency facilities,
tuned with GIS information, is proposed in [8].
Site selection based on spatial eﬃciency of exist-
ing and future facilities is studied extensively in
many prior works [9–11]. A GIS based approach
for emergency facility location is the primary focus
of [12, 13]. Various optimization models to solve
facility location problems, both in the context of
cost and service coverage optimizations, are widely
studied in the literature [14–16]. In [17], an opti-
mization methodology based on response time of
the ﬁre stations is proposed to select new facilities.
However, when there exists a constraint on the
maximum number of facilities that can be sited,
determining the weights on multiple options in
decision-making can be challenging. Here, prioriti-
zation of service demand locations based on future
risk prediction can be helpful [18]. Fire risk predic-
tion has been a primary focus of many researchers;
however, this work has mostly pertained to forest
and wild land ﬁres [19–23]. [24] presents an exten-
sive study on the eﬀect of climate on ﬁre prediction
along with an analysis of the impact of diﬀerent
seasons on burned area from global perspective. In
[25], the authors propose a neural network model
to predict forest ﬁres with spatio-temporal data.
Urban ﬁre risk prediction has received little
attention despite the critical nature of such appli-
cations. [26] provides a data-driven approach to
predict commercial and residential building ﬁres.
In [27], a Random Forest algorithm is used to
generate predicted ﬁre risk scores to aide the

local ﬁre department in identifying properties that
require ﬁre inspections. Such data-driven predic-
tive models are widely used in many prior works
[28–31]. [32] proposes an interesting approach to
prediction of ﬁre incidents that is based on a
deep neural network. Here, the authors use spatio-
temporal data from GIS to learn a generative
model. However, application of these models to
locate new facilities has not been extensively stud-
ied. Moreover, other critical aspects of ﬁre rescue
service, such as response time [33], need to be
combined with prediction models. In summary, an
uniﬁed approach, to select new ﬁre station loca-
tions in urban settings, that considers ﬁre service
demand predictions and temporal variables with
proper characterization of service priorities and
redundancies is limited in the literature.

To this end, we propose an end-to-end ﬁre sta-
tion location selection methodology that respects
predicted demand as well as travel time. We pro-
pose a Random Forest (RF) model to predict
demand for urban ﬁre and emergency services
demand and combine it with travel time infor-
mation to assess service quality. We quantify the
quality of service using our proposed Service Qual-
ity Index and further utilize it to identify candi-
date locations for additional ﬁre stations. Finally,
an optimization model is presented to select the
best option(s) among the candidate locations. In
summary, we devise a systematic approach for
locating a new ﬁre station using GIS and temporal
data. Our demand prediction model is inspired by
[26, 27]; however, instead of restricting the model
to residential and commercial buildings, we con-
sider all types of properties present in a typical
city. We apply our proposed methodology to aid
VFD with site selection for the new ﬁre station in
the city of Victoria. Historical ﬁre incident data
is provided by VFD which is augmented with GIS
and other demographic data collected from multi-
ple diﬀerent sources. We substantiate the eﬃcacy
of our method with extensive experimental results.
The rest of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: The proposed service quality index and
the demand prediction models are explained in
Section 3. Section 4 describes the algorithm to
choose suitable candidate locations for new station
installation. Two optimization problem formula-
tions, to select new ﬁre station locations from the
candidates, are introduced in Section 5. Eﬃcacy
of our proposed approach is illustrated with a

3 Service Quality Assessment

The service quality of existing ﬁre stations is an
important indicator that inﬂuences the choice of
candidate locations for future facilities. However,
in the context of urban ﬁre safety, there is no
standard approach to assess the service quality
that considers demographic factors such as age of
residents, income, property types, population den-
sity, etc. Apart from demographic factors, another
important aspect to measure ﬁre safety is travel
time from the responding station to the incident
location. A longer travel time can result in signif-
icant damage or even loss of life. In this context,
we propose a generalized service quality index for
each property within the service area of a ﬁre sta-
tion, considering both demographic factors and
travel time, as described in the following sections.

3.1 Service Quality Index

Let J denote the set of demand locations (proper-
ties) and let I denote the set of ﬁre stations within
the city boundary. We deﬁne the Service Quality
Index (SQI) of a demand location j ∈ J with
respect to a ﬁre station i ∈ I as follows:

SQIji := P (j) ˆT (j, i),

(1)

where P (j) ∈ [0, 1] denotes the probability of
demand request at a location j and ˆT (j, i) denotes
the normalized travel time from ﬁre station i to
the demand location j. The normalized travel time
can be calculated as follows:

ˆT (j, i) =

Tactual(j, i)
Tnorm

,

(2)

where Tnorm is a normalization factor to ensure
ˆT (j, i) ∈ [0, 1] and Tactual(j, i) is the actual travel
time from ﬁre station i to demand location j which
can be calculated using GIS. A lower value of
SQIji indicates better service. Note that, SQIji
depends on the probability of demand request
P (j) of property location j, which usually depends
on factors like local population density, property
type (residential, business etc.), property age, and
demographic factors such as residents’ age, median

income, etc. Moreover, SQIji also considers the
response time for emergency personnel to reach a
location, a crucial factor in quality of service [34].

Remark 1 In the trivial case of no existing ﬁre station,
ˆT (j, i) is undeﬁned. Here, one can take SQIji values
to be equal to P (j) and the rest of the analysis follows.

Remark 2 The trade-oﬀ between low demand proba-
bility at a location with a long travel time from i and
high demand probability at a location with a short
travel time from i ensures a balance between area cov-
erage and emphasis on demand request. However, the
interpretation of better (or worse) service quality can
be tuned per the facility planners’ requirements as we
describe next.

Availability of multiple ﬁre stations ideally
enhances the service quality at a location. How-
ever, it is very diﬃcult to characterize, quantify,
and predict the availability status of all the sta-
tions at the time of demand request. Also note
that the probability of a demand request usually
depends on demographic and property character-
istics, and hence is independent of the location of
ﬁre stations. Therefore, we factor out the depen-
dency on a particular ﬁre station by taking the
minimum of SQIji values over all ﬁre stations
i ∈ I. Therefore, the Service Quality Index of a
property j can be written as

SQI(j) = min
i∈I

SQIji.

(3)

The interpretation of better/worse service
quality can be done by categorizing the demand
locations into low, medium, and high quality loca-
tions based on their SQI values. Let the sets
Jl, Jm, Jh ⊆ J denote the set of indices of the
demand locations with low, medium and high
quality of service which are deﬁned as follows:

j ∈ Jh,
j ∈ Jm,
j ∈ Jl,

if 0 ≤ SQI(j) < τl,
if τl ≤ SQI(j) < τh,
if τh ≤ SQI(j) ≤ 1,

(4)

where τl, τh are user-deﬁned constants in R with
0 < τl < τh ≤ 1. Note that, the choice of τl and
τh provides an interpretation of ﬁre service qual-
ity at a location based on planning constraints.

For example, one can calculate the values of τl, τh
based on maximum allowable travel time (which
depends on the type of ﬁre station [34]) and an
acceptable demand request probability that is to
be considered as high demand. Thus, our objective
is to identify candidate locations to install addi-
tional ﬁre stations such that the SQI values of
j ∈ Jl are improved.

3.2 Demand Prediction Model

Calculation of SQI requires a ﬁre service demand
prediction model. In addition to the ability to
accurately predict the probability of a service
request for a future emergency event, it is also
important to gain insights about the predictors
and their eﬀects on demand for services. Such
information can be utilized for resource planning
and staﬀ management. In this context, tree based
models are suitable as they can be used to quan-
titatively assess the importance and the eﬀect
of the predictors. We propose to use Random
Forest (RF) [2] and Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) [3] algorithms, along with a detailed
performance comparison, to predict the probabil-
ity of a demand request P (j) for each property
j ∈ J . In building the prediction models, we con-
sider various demographic factors and property
features as described in Table 2. Note that, service
demand prediction, with an objective of ﬁre sta-
tion location selection, is a static analysis. Unlike
short-term demand prediction models based on
online learning algorithms [35] in a dynamic envi-
ronment, our model requires long-term demand
prediction. Thus we include only spatial factors in
our prediction models. The temporal factors, gov-
erning the dynamic nature of service demand, are
analyzed in [36] to aide VFD in resource planning
and staﬀ management. The properties included in
our analysis are categorized into four categories
based on their usage as shown in Table 1. For our
case study, the types of land use are obtained from
[37].

The predictor and response variables of our

prediction model are described in Table 2.

Remark 3 The age of a property is calculated from
the year it is built and the year when an incident
is reported. For example, if a property built in 2010
reports a ﬁre event in 2015, then ‘Age’= 5. Multi-
ple events at the same location at diﬀerent points in

Once the prediction models are built, we
obtain the demand request probabilities P (j)
using the class probability estimates of the sam-
ples corresponding to the positive labeled class
(class of samples with response variables labeled
as 1; Refer to Table 2). We present the detailed
performance measures of our proposed prediction
models and variable importance in Section 6.2 for
our case study.
Upon ﬁnding the demand request probabilities, it
remains to compute travel time from a ﬁre station

to a property in order to completely characterize
SQI values for each property. We calculate travel
time using the Open Street Map-Based Routing
Service (OSRM) package [38] in R [39] with traf-
ﬁc ﬂow disabled to account for the relaxed traﬃc
rules for ﬁre service vehicles. Once the SQI val-
ues are calculated, we need to identify suitable
geographic locations for additional ﬁre stations.
In the next section, we discuss our proposed
methodology to select such candidate locations.

4 Determining candidate

locations

The probability of a demand request depends on
demographic and property characteristics and is
independent of the location of a ﬁre station. Thus,
from (1), we note that improvement of SQI val-
ues can be achieved by placing additional ﬁre
stations in close proximity to areas with proper-
ties having high SQI values (poor service) with
respect to the existing ﬁre stations. Let Ic denote
the index set of candidate locations for new ﬁre
stations. We aim to ﬁnd out the geographic loca-
tions of candidate ﬁre stations ic ∈ Ic such that
SQI(j), j ∈ Jl, is minimized (service becomes
better). In this context, our objective is to locate
high density clusters of properties in Jl. Once the
clusters are found, we can choose to place the
new ﬁre stations within the clusters by considering
other qualitative features such as road accessibil-
ity, terrain condition, availability of vacant space,
etc. Note that in order to improve the ﬁre ser-
vice, ﬁnding the clusters that have high densities
of properties j ∈ Jl, should be based on the travel
time rather than euclidean distance (which is not
suitable for measuring distance between points on
a sphere) or haversine distance. For example, even
if two properties are close to each other in terms
of their longitude and latitude, the time to travel
from one to another may be large due to various
factors such as road inaccessibility or traﬃc con-
gestion. Moreover, the existence of outliers (for
example, a few properties far from the main city),
and arbitrarily shaped clusters are well-known
problems in spatial clustering that cannot be han-
dled by centroid-based clustering algorithms such
as K-Means [40]. Another challenge associated
with clustering algorithms such as K-Means is the
required speciﬁcation of the number of clusters.

Although there exist various methods to empir-
ically ﬁnd the optimal number of clusters [41],
they are not always reliable in spatial clustering
[4]. Therefore, we propose to use the Density-
based spatial clustering of applications with noise
(DBSCAN) algorithm [4] with distance measure
replaced with travel time. We group properties
based on the travel time between pairs of proper-
ties. Let n denote the total number of properties in
Jl. We ﬁrst compute the travel time between each
pair of properties in Jl using the OSRM package
[38] in R [39]. The travel time information is stored
in a symmetric matrix T ∈ Rn×n
+ , where each ele-
ment T [i, j] denotes the actual travel time from
i to j, Tactual(i, j). The longitude and latitude
values of each property are stored in P ∈ Rn×2
such that the ith row of P corresponds to the
ith row of T . Our travel time based DBSCAN
requires two parameters, (cid:15) and δ. (cid:15) denotes the
(cid:15)-neighborhood of a property j, which is deﬁned
as the set {k ∈ Jl
| T [k, j] ≤ (cid:15)}. δ denotes
the minimum number of properties required to
be present in the (cid:15)-neighborhood of j to be con-
sidered a part of a cluster. Note that in travel
time based DBSCAN, the number of clusters is
found during runtime and is not required to be
speciﬁed a priori. Once the clusters are obtained,
we choose to locate the candidate ﬁre stations
close to the centroids of the clusters (for our case
study, we account for the factors such as avail-
ability of vacant space based on the future city
development plan [37], road accessibility, terrain,
etc.) The travel time based DBSCAN algorithm
is shown in Algorithm 1. Next, we present the
optimization model to select the best location(s)
among the candidate sites.

5 Fire Station Location

Selection

Installation of new ﬁre stations along with exist-
ing facilities can cause the service areas of the ﬁre
stations to overlap. It is desirable to locate new
ﬁre stations in such a way that the overlap of
service areas is minimized and the aggregated cov-
erage area is maximized. In this context we ﬁrst
introduce the concept of catchment area and then
formulate an optimization problem utilizing the
SQI values and the catchment areas of each candi-
date location, to select best location(s) among the

candidates to install new ﬁre station(s). Further,
in a facility planning model, involving demand
probabilities,
it is required to characterize the
stochasticity of decision outcome. Therefore, we
propose a two-stage stochastic optimization for-
mulation, based on probabilistic reward function,
to analyze the stochastic performance of the our
model. Note that, both of our proposed optimiza-
tion formulation can be utilized to select the best
location(s) to install new ﬁre station(s) while the
two-stage stochastic optimization model provide
more insight into the conﬁdence in the decision.

5.1 Catchment Area

The ﬁre service in a city usually maintains a per-
formance bound on the time required to travel
from the station to the incident location. The
bound depends on the type of ﬁre station [34]
and the local government. Let Tmax denote the
speciﬁed bound on the travel time. With this con-
straint, the candidate locations of new ﬁre stations
ic ∈ Ic should allow the number of demand points
j ∈ J for which Tactual(j, ic) ≤ Tmax to be
maximized. Essentially, the catchment area of a
candidate location ic includes properties j ∈ J
that cannot be accessed from any existing station
i ∈ I within Tmax but can be accessed from ic
within the speciﬁed travel time limit of Tmax. An
illustrative example of catchment areas with one
existing ﬁre station and two candidate ﬁre stations
is shown in Fig. 1. In this example, the stations are

Fig. 1 Catchment area with one existing and two candi-
date stations. Circles with Tmax radius denote areas that
can be reached from respective stations within Tmax time

located at the center of circles covering areas that
can be reached within Tmax units of time from the
center. Note that the catchment areas of the can-
didate stations are the areas that do not overlap
with the existing station. To ensure good area cov-
erage along with SQI improvement, we propose to
place the future stations within the cluster of high
SQI properties that cover the maximum num-
ber of properties within their respective catchment
areas. In the next section we present the optimiza-
tion model. It is derived from the maximum area
coverage problem [42].

5.2 SQI Based Optimization
Problem Formulation

The best locations for future ﬁre stations are those
that maximize the number of properties with high
SQI (poor service by the existing ﬁre stations)
within their respective catchment areas. A prop-
erty with higher SQI (poorer service by existing
ﬁre stations) is given more priority relative to a
property with lower SQI (better service by exist-
ing ﬁre stations). Therefore, we propose to weigh
the properties according to their SQI values. Let
us assume that it is required to locate at most p
number of additional ﬁre stations. For each candi-
date location i ∈ Ic we consider a binary decision
variable xi. It takes a value of 1 if candidate
location i is selected and 0 otherwise. For each
property j ∈ J we consider another binary deci-
sion variable yj which takes a value of 1 if that
property is within the catchment area of any can-
didate location i ∈ Ic, and 0 otherwise. For each
property j, Nj denotes the set of candidate sta-
tions whose catchment areas cover that property.
In other words, the property j can be reached
within maximum allowable travel time from any
of the candidate locations in Nj. Our objective is
to obtain values for xi and yj that maximize the
weighted sum (cid:80)
j∈J SQI(j)yj. Hence, our pro-
posed weighted maximum coverage optimization
problem can be stated as follows:

5.3 Two-stage Stochastic

Optimization Problem
Formulation

Our proposed two-stage stochastic optimization
problem is an iterative process involving a stochas-
tic reward function Rt(i) associated with each
candidate location i∈Ic in iteration t∈N. We asso-
ciate a random variable Xj,t with each demand
location j ∈ J in tth iteration. We assume that,
for all t ∈ N and j ∈ J , the set of random variables
{Xj,t} are independent and identically distributed
according to Bernoulli distribution with Pr(Xj,t =
1) = P (j) = 1 − Pr(Xj,t = 0) = 1 − (1 − P (j)).
Note that, such a deﬁnition assigns a value of 1 or
0 to Xj,t based on the demand request probability,
P (j). Let Ci := {j ∈ J | ˆT (j, i) ≤ ˆTmax, i ∈ Ic}
denote the catchment area of candidate i ∈ Ic. We
deﬁne the reward function as

Rt(i) :=

(cid:88)

j∈Ci

Xj,t.

xi ≤ p,

yj ∈ {0, 1} for all j ∈ J ,

Our proposed approach is as follows: at itera-
tion t ≥ 1,
in the ﬁrst stage, the candidate,
it ∈ Ic, having maximum expected reward till (t−
1)thiteration, Qt−1(it), is chosen. We compute the
expected reward, till tth iteration, corresponding
to each candidate location as follows:

J = set of all demand locations within the city,
Ic = Set of candidate ﬁre stations,
p = Number of ﬁre stations to be located,
ˆT (j, i) = Normalized travel time from ﬁre station i,

to demand location j,

ˆTmax = Normalized maximum allowable travel time,

Qt(i) :=

(cid:80)t

k=1
(cid:80)t

1(ik=i)Rk(i)

,

(11)

where 1(ik=i) = 1 if candidate i is chosen at
iteration k, and 0 otherwise. Thus,

it = argmaxi∈Ic Qt−1(i).

In the next stage, all demand locations in it’s
catchment area, Cit , are triggered and the values
{Xj,t | j ∈ Cit} are probabilistically determined
and the reward Rt(it) is evaluated as per (10).
Once Rt(it) is evaluated, we update the expected
reward for all i ∈ Ic as per (11).
We employ an epsilon-greedy approach to enable
exploration of all candidates to ﬁnd the optimal
candidate that maximizes the reward, that is, with
probability (1 − (cid:15)) we choose it as per (12) and
with probability (cid:15), we randomly choose a candi-
date from Ic. Upon termination of our proposed
algorithm, based on a maximum iteration count
tmax, the candidate having maximum expected
reward is chosen as the optimal location to install
a new ﬁre station. Note that, if p number of ﬁre
stations are to be located, where p > 1, the ﬁrst
p candidates corresponding to expected rewards
sorted in descending order, can be chosen. The
sets Ic and Ci are derived as described in Section 4
and Section 5.1 respectively and (cid:15) is tuned empir-
ically. The entire algorithm is summarized in
Algorithm 2. We now present a detailed case study

6 Case Study: City of

Victoria, MN

To apply our proposed methodology, we partnered
with the city of Victoria ﬁre Department (VFD)
to select a suitable location for a new ﬁre sta-
tion. The city of Victoria is located in Carver
county of Minnesota, USA. The city enjoys a
solid economic and agricultural foundation. This
has catalyzed rapid urbanization and population
growth in the past few years. The increased accep-
tance of remote-work situations will further add
to the city’s growth. Per the US Census Bureau
[43], the population of the city rose from 7400 in
2010 to 9170 in 2017. The current population (at
the time of writing) is approximately 10000 and
this number is expected to increase by 68% by the
year 2040 [37]. Currently, Victoria is being served
by one ﬁre station. The expected growth and eco-
nomic development has caused concern among the
city’s leadership that the current infrastructure
may be insuﬃcient to provide adequate public
safety services, including those services provided
by the ﬁre department. Therefore, VFD initiated
a resilient community project (RCP) in 2019 to
assess the performance of the existing facility and
to identify a location for an additional ﬁre sta-
tion. The new facility will enhance (not replace)
the capabilities of the existing ﬁre station. A data
exploratory analysis, as a part of the RCP initia-
tive, is performed in [44] to ﬁnd spatio-temporal
demand statistics. Following the statistics and the
city guidelines, as presented in [44], we apply our
location selection methodology to provide a com-
prehensive guidance on future station location.
Our database features and the detailed description
of our results are presented in the next sections.

6.1 Description of Data

prised of data from multiple diﬀerent sources.
Data containing the details

are provided by VFD. In particular, the dataset
contains: (1) incident types (ﬁre, explosion and

false alarm, natural disaster, and special intent
type), (2) address of incident location, (3) date

and time, (4) Response time, (5) ﬁre service vehi-
cle used. As there are reported incidents for these
properties between 2010 and 2020, these proper-
ties are designated as demand requesting loca-
tions. We use Carver county’s open data portal
[45] to further augment this dataset with proper-
ties with no reported incidents, and these proper-
ties are designated as no demand requesting loca-
tions. The entire dataset contains 5334 samples
of which 47.9% have reported historical incidents.
Parcel information for each property location is
also obtained from [45]. The parcel information
includes address, land size (acres), estimated land
value ($), property usage category (see Table 1),
and year of construction. This dataset is aug-
mented with block-wise average population and
median age of residents obtained from the US
census bureau and Federal Communications Com-
mission [46, 47]. For the spatial analysis, the
latitude and longitude of the property locations
are obtained from the US Census Bureau Geocod-
ing Service [48]. However, some locations cannot
be geocoded due to incorrect address entries, such
as zip code and address line mismatch, which are
primarily caused by human errors. These entries
are matched by address lines in the Carver County
Active911 database [49] to obtain the geographic
locations. The US census bureau geocoder along
with the Active911 database reduce the number
of missing data due to common errors. Every
record is matched by property address to create
the fully processed database. There are several
sources of missing data, mainly due to misspellings
and abbreviations of the addresses (such as ‘high-
way’ is termed as ‘hwy’ / ‘hgwy’ / ‘highway’ and
sometimes misspelled as ‘hgihway’, ‘drive’ is rep-
resented as ‘Dr’/‘drv’/‘drive’ etc.). Some of the
common errors are taken care of in the data clean-
ing step; however, several diﬀerent types of errors
leads to some amount of missing data. (4.2% of
the entire dataset). We performed our proposed
station location selection analysis on this dataset
and the results are presented in the subsequent
sections.

6.2 Demand Prediction using

Random Forest and XGBoost

Fig. 2 shows the locations of all incidents that
occurred in 2010 − 2020 (until Oct 2020) on an
open street map. At the time of writing, the

City of Victoria has dense residential areas in the
southeast [37]. The concentration of the incident
locations in the southeast, as can be seen in Fig. 2,
indicates that the service demand is mostly con-
centrated in the residential areas. All of the maps
are created using ArcGIS [50]. The shapeﬁles of
the ﬁre district and city boundary are taken from
[51, 52]. The incidents outside the ﬁre district are
typically serviced in cooperation with other ﬁre
departments, while some of the events that are
outside the city boundary, but inside the Victo-
ria ﬁre district, are serviced by the VFD. For rest

2020 (till Oct): Incidents are concentrated in southern
region and in residential areas. Existing facility is marked
with black star icon and the locations are marked with red
dots. Blue solid line indicates ﬁre district boundary. Black
dashed line indicates Victoria city boundary

of our analysis, we consider only those properties
that are within the VFD ﬁre district and served
by VFD only, in case of emergency events. We
combine the properties with history of reported
incidents and other properties with no historical
event. The entire dataset, with the sample features
shown in Table 2, is used to build our proposed
prediction models for demand request prediction.
We implement our RF model using the Scikit-
learn package [53] and XGBoost model using the
xgboost package in Python. 80% of the total num-
ber of samples are used for training the model and
the remaining 20% are used for performance test-
ing and ﬁne tuning. Table 3 and 4 shows the set
of parameters used for grid search, with 10-fold

The ROC curve [54] is shown in Fig. 3a. It
can be seen that both of our models perform
very well
in predicting the demand request of
diﬀerent property types. Further, our extreme gra-
dient boosting model performs signiﬁcantly better
than the RF model
in terms of accuracy and
true and false positive rates. RF model exhibits
a true positive rate (TPR) of 69% and 65% for
the training and the test set respectively while
with XGBoost they are improved to 89% and 80%
respectively. The false positive rate (FPR) values

and local government, as it can result in unnec-
essary investments in safety measures. We derive
impurity based feature importance, as illustrated
in Fig. 3b, to explain the eﬀect of demographic and
property features on the service demand request.
Here, we observe that the most important fea-
tures in determining service demand are property
age, median age of residents in the block where
the property is located, land size, population at
the block level, and estimated land value. We
note that this additional information can be uti-
lized by city of Victoria to further analyze future
service demand with projected growth [37]. As
our XGBoost model performs better than the RF
model, we use the class probability estimates of
our XGBoost model as the demand request prob-
abilities for the calculation of SQI. The raw class
probabilities are scaled to have values between 0 to
1 using min-max normalization. We categorize the
demand request probabilities into three categories
as shown in Table 6, in order to tune τl and τh
that are required for (4). Table 6 shows the num-
ber of properties falling under each category as a
percentage of total number of properties within
the VFD ﬁre district. The spatial distribution of
the same is presented in Fig. 4. After obtain-

for Algorithm 1 and the for the SQI-based opti-

in Table 7. Note that the parameters τl, τh are
derived from the demand request probability cate-

Once the probability of service demand of all prop-

and the travel time from VFD to each prop-

Section 3.1. It is observed that most of the prop-
erties with medium demand request probabilities,
but far from the existing ﬁre station, are marked
as receiving low quality of service while the prop-
erties with high demand but close to the existing
ﬁre station are marked as receiving better service.

Fig. 6 Catchment areas of candidate locations based on

indicating least redundancy in service along with the exist-
ing facility. Existing facility is marked with black star icon
and the candidate locations are shown with large circles to
indicate broader zones. Blue solid line indicates ﬁre district
and black dashed line indicates Victoria city boundary

Note that the non-overlapped 4-minute travel
time polygons between SW, S, and NE with the
existing station form the catchment areas of the
candidates. We aim to apply our SQI-based opti-
mization methodology, as described in Section 5.2,
with respect to these catchment areas. Proper-
ties within the catchment areas of SW, S, and
NE are obtained using ‘sf’ package [55]
in R.
VFD seeks a location for one additional ﬁre sta-
tion, i.e. p = 1. We remark that although the
project with VFD requires one additional station,
our methodology can be applied without modiﬁ-
cation to more general settings for any value of p.
The optimization problem is solved using ILOG
CPLEX Optimization Studio V20.1 [56]. The solu-
tion to the optimization problem indicates that
SW candidate is the one that maximizes the num-
ber of properties with high SQI (lower service
quality, marked red in Fig. 5) within its catch-
ment area. A detailed comparison of the number
of properties in each SQI category as a percent-
age of total number of properties is presented in
Table 9. The existing ﬁre station is abbreviated
as ‘Ex’ and the expected performance, in case of
an additional ﬁre station with the existing one,
is tabulated. Note that while the existing station

Now, we apply Algorithm 1 on the properties
marked with red in Fig. 5 to ﬁnd the candidate
locations. Algorithm 1 is implemented using the
Scikit-learn package [53] in Python. The result is
shown in Fig. 6 along with the 4-minute drive
time polygons of the candidates. We only show the
approximate locations of the candidates with cir-
cles on the map to conform to the conﬁdentiality
of actual locations as requested by VFD. Based on
Algorithm 1, we ﬁnd three candidate locations in
the ﬁre district: (a) northeast, (b) southwest and
(c) south. For the rest of our analysis, we denote
the candidates by:

provides high quality service to 15.1% of proper-
ties, an additional ﬁre station at SW can enhance
it to 23.8%. Thus, we can expect an improvement
of 53% over the existing performance. However,
the installation of an additional station at S or
NE location results in an approximate 23 − 33%
improvement over the existing one. Similarly, in
the case of low service quality properties, SW loca-
tion provides an improvement of approximately
25%, while S and NE both provide an approximate
20% improvement. To analyze the improvement

in SQI from the installation of an additional ﬁre
station at the SW location, we show histograms of
SQI values of all the properties considering only
the existing ﬁre station and considering the exist-
ing station along with SW candidate, as per (3)
(see Fig. 7a). We see that the addition of the SW
candidate location increases the density towards
the head of the distribution, thus improving the
number of properties with low SQI (better ser-
vice quality). Similarly, Fig. 7b and 7c show the
SQI histogram comparison between SW, NE and
SW, S candidates. We observe that the improve-
ment by installing SW candidate, which is visible
from the increased density towards the head of the
distribution, is clear from all the plots.

We conclude our analysis by illustrating the
geographical distribution of properties catego-
rized, as per (4), with both the existing ﬁre station
and the additional ﬁre station at SW location. The
plot is shown in Fig. 8. A visual comparison of
Fig. 5 and 8 reveals that the installation of the
SW candidate signiﬁcantly reduces the number
of properties with poor service quality. Note that
the concentration of poor service quality proper-
ties in the northeast and southern parts of the
city is diﬃcult to avoid with the installation of
only one additional ﬁre station due to longer travel
times from either the existing facility or from the
SW candidate location. The longer travel time is
mainly attributed to the presence of lakes, terrain

our proposed two-stage stochastic optimization
model, as described in Section 5.3, to character-
ize the conﬁdence in our decision to locate a new
ﬁre station at the SW location, which is appar-
ent from our previous discussion. We run our
proposed Algorithm 2 in 400 episodes each with
a maximum iteration number tmax = 200. The
catchment areas and the candidate locations are
same as described in the previous sections. The
(cid:15) value is taken to be 0.7. Fig. 9 shows the den-
sity histogram plot of the expected rewards of
the candidates SW, S, and NE for 400 episodes.
The histograms are plotted with a bin size of
40. It can be observed that SW location accu-
mulates highest expected reward followed by S
and NE respectively. Further, the narrower his-
togram corresponding to SW location indicates
lower standard deviation of the expected rewards,
indicating a higher conﬁdence in the decision to
choose SW as the optimal location to install a new
ﬁre station.Therefore, we propose the SW location
to VFD for the installment of an additional ﬁre
station.

7 Conclusions

In this work we present a systematic approach
for locating new ﬁre stations, taking into account

Fig. 9 Histogram of expected reward accumulated by the
candidates SW, S, and NE for 400 episodes each with 200
iterations. SW has the maximum expected reward. Vari-
ation of expected reward is signiﬁcantly lesser in case of
SW, compared to S and NE, as can be observed by nar-
row standard deviation of the histogram corresponding to
SW. Thus, selection of SW location as the optimal choice
to install a new ﬁre station, as determined by our proposed
algorithm has the highest conﬁdence.

demand prediction, travel time, service area cov-
erage, and service redundancy. We propose a
machine learning model based on the random for-
est and extreme gradient boosting algorithms to
predict service demand, which can then be used
to enhance the community safety. We present a
detailed comparison between the performance of
the models to select the better model for further
study. We observe that extreme gradient boosting
model outperforms the random forest model. With
the help of the machine learning model, we corrob-
orate the inﬂuence and the importance of the key
factors governing ﬁre service demand associated
with the properties. The model is further utilized
to deﬁne a service quality index to quantify quality
of service, which accounts for both demand predic-
tion and travel time from ﬁre stations to demand
locations. The quality index is utilized in a travel
time based DBSCAN algorithm to identify can-
didate locations for new ﬁre stations. Finally, we
present a service quality index based optimization
model that is derived from the maximum coverage
optimization problem, considering demand prior-
itization and service area redundancy. We apply
our proposed methodology to select a location for
a new ﬁre station in the city of Victoria, MN,
USA. Further, we employ a two-stage stochastic
optimization model to characterize the conﬁdence
in our decision outcome. We recommend that a
