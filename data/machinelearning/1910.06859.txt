Computational Psychology to Embed 
Emotions into News or Advertisements to 
Increase Reader Affinity 

Hrishikesh Kulkarni,    Dr. Prachi Joshi,  Prof (Dr.) Pradip Chande 

Abstract ‚Äì Readers take decisions about going through the complete news based on many 
factors. The emotional impact of the news title on reader is one of the most important 
factors.  Cognitive  ergonomics  tries  to  strike  the  balance  between  work,  product  and 
environment with human needs and capabilities. The utmost need to integrate emotions 
in  the  news  as  well  as  advertisements  cannot  be  denied.  The  idea  is  that  news  or 
advertisement should be able to engage the reader on emotional and behavioral platform. 
While  achieving  this  objective  there  is  need  to  learn  about  reader  behavior  and  use 
computational  psychology  while  presenting  as  well  as  writing  news  or  advertisements. 
This  paper  based  on  Machine  Learning,  tries  to  map  behavior  of  the  reader  with  the 
news/advertisements and also provide inputs for affective value for building personalized 
news or advertisements presentations. The affective value of the news is determined and 
news artifacts are mapped to reader. The algorithm suggests the most suitable news for 
readers while understanding emotional traits required for personalization. This work can 
be  used  to  improve  reader  satisfaction  through  embedding  emotions  in  the  reading 
material  and  prioritizing  news  presentations.  It  can  be  used  to  map  personal  reading 
material  range,  personalized  programs  and  ranking  programs,  advertisements  with 
reference to individuals. 

1.0 INTRODUCTION 

Purpose of any news or advertisement is to engage readers or customers. The quality content 
is silver bullet to it. But is that the only thing. Many quality news get unnoticed while some 
other news or advertisements touch to heart of readers and customers. Human emotions play a 
major role in this process. Even there is significant part played by culture, group and associated 
individuals.  While  computational  sociology  tries  to  model  and  analyze  complex  social 
processes.  These  social  processes  and  culture  of  individual  also  help  in  deciding  the  news 
which can keep reader engage. Understanding computational aspects of human behavior comes 
under computational psychology and computational anthropology. Research on personalized 
advertisement and personalized news attracted many researchers. It was always dealing with 
delivering  the  highest  impact  in  given  small  duration.  Researcher  worked  on  delivering 
personalized news and advertisements to television viewers. They clustered TV viewers and 
mapped advertisement to clusters [1].  Researcher worked on personalized advertisements for 
digital 
television  [2].  Researchers  also  worked  on  personalized  news 
recommendation based on user click behavior [3]. Researchers used log analysis and bayesian 
recommendation  for  the  same.  Researchers  worked  on  adaptive  news  access  so  that  reader 
would not be exposed to news not relevant to them [4]. Focus of this work was to reach out to 
readers interested in the news. Mostly this work was focus on past logs, what person searches 
and on which type of news he is clicking frequently. Mostly it was based on keyword centric 
classification  of  news  [5].  The  work  has  further  evolved  to  personality  mining.  In  this 
movement of personalization researchers got attracted  towards  mapping  human  behavior to 

interactive 

 
 
culture.  The  work  was  focused  on  modeling  culture.  Researchers  even  looked  at  cultural 
modeling  from  genomic  perspective  [6].  Researchers  even  worked  on  emotional  aspects  of 
culture [7]. There is work reported regarding culture, emotions and depression with reference 
to behavioral consequences[8]. If we can mine the personality and culture of individuals it can 
be  possible  to  embed  personalized  emotions  in  news  or  advertisements.  The  emotions 
embedding is done with reference to color, shape or even inscribed text. Even words can be 
selected in headline can have embedded emotions. Embedding emotions and cultural traits in 
news or advertisements is inspired from embedding emotions into products. When it comes to 
embedding emotions in products, researcher began with use of colors to map emotions. Kansei 
was one of the early break through attempt to embed emotions in products and processes [9]. 
Researchers  even  worked  on  use  of  Kansei  engineering  in  development  [10].    Researchers 
worked  on  deriving  emotions  based  on  expressions  of  individuals.  This  expressions  are 
considered in specific scenario to understand context [11]. 

This paper focuses on embedding emotions in advertisement and news. Advertisement are tend 
to attach emotionally with the viewer. Simple example is a use of color in advertisement that 
is more compelling for the viewer or using words those connect him emotionally to the product. 
Same is true for news. News also have connectivity, words and flow. If it flows so that it can 
connect to reader it can keep him engage resulting him seeking his attention and achieving the 
desired impact. In this research readers are classified based on their emotional responses. This 
helps us to decide emotional theme for that individual. When this theme is associated with the 
context it is represented with the set of words. This word corpus helps us to identify the news 
suitable for  a particular  person.  The news  are ranked  with  reference  to  the  candidate. Even 
chronology  can  also  be  decided  so  that  news  can  be  presented  to  reader  in  a  particular 
personalized order to produce maximum impact.  

2.0 PROPOSED METHODOLOGY 

The proposed algorithm is based on association of number of vectors. In first part the emotional 
traits of individuals are determined based on his or her expressions. Here expression come in 
the form of responses to scenarios. Scenarios or advertisement are represented with parameters 
impacting customers. In this particular case either same advertisement is presented in different 
colors  or  there  can  be  textual  slogans  associated  with  the  advertisements.  While  these 
advertisements are presented to customer he was given options to rank them. Such multiple 
runs  are  used  for  learning  and  association  of  his/her  emotional  traits  with  advertisement 
features. Typical features like color, textual inscription and arrangements of different articles 
are  considered.  Different  colors  are  associated  with  different  emotions  with  reference  to 
cultures at different locations. While saffron or orange is associated with religious feelings in 
Indian  continents, white  is associated  with  piece.  Similarly  some words specifically depicts 
personalized emotions with reference to context. The algorithm selects the words those can 
deliver  highest  impacts  on  customers  increasing  his  affinity  towards  the  product.  Similarly 
news headlines are tuned in personalized way to deliver grater impact on readers. Every word 
in advertisement produce an unique emotional impact on reader. This impact either increase 
his affinity towards that particular news or product or some times it can repel him away from 
that  product.  In  case  the  news  can  establish  emotional  affinity  with  the  reader  it  leads  to  a 
situation where he reads that news carefully and even start following news by same presenter, 
same channel or even in the same topic. This is even true for advetisements. If advertisements 
can establish emotional bonding with the reader he/she start looking for the products in the 

 
advertised. This leads to emotional affinity of a person with a particular brand. This can result 
in  person  buying  many  other  products  by  same  brand.  This  emotional  affinity  sometimes 
overrides his personal preferences and utility parameters. Even he starts perceiving the product 
as one of the most useful products and becomes a sort of brand ambassador of that particular 
brand.  

3.0 EMBEDDING EMOTIONS 

How to embed emotions in the advertisements or news still remains a challenge in front of 
researchers. To embed emotions we need to identify personalized emotions. With reference to 
these personalized emotions we have to map perception and cognition so that when customer 
will look at advertisement he should feel an emotional attachment with the product. In case of 
news or advertisement the corpus of words mapping to the emotions of customer is used. The 
most suitable word is determined based on personality vector. To achieve the desired emotional 
impact three major factors are considered. These three factors are color, shape and presentation. 
In case of presentation order of images as well as inscribed text is also considered. Presentation 
includes other additional things like order in presentation and inscribed text.  

During the first step the personality mining is used to formulate personality vector. Based on 
customers selections of answers in the form of visual objects personality vector is derived. The 
associations among customer expressions are used for the same. 

Hypothesis 1: Expression based personality vector can be used to predict emotional affinity of 
customer with the news or advertisement. 

Hypothesis 2: Color, shape and presentation along with inscribed text can be used to embed 
emotions in news and advertisements 

Eq. 1 gives a personality vector while eq. 2 gives emotion vector of a candidate.

Same advertisement with images is presented in multiple colors, different inscribed texts  and 
changing  background  to  capture  emotions.  In  similar  fashion  total  five  advertisements  are 
presented to customer. The same exercise is conducted with news articles. In this case headline 
are changed with some specific set of words. The responses by readers/customers are captured. 
It is observed that particular percept results in a sort of emotions. Thus it is about identifying 
perceptions like color, shape, inscribed text and size so that it impacts positively on emotions of 
the customer. It could result in emotional affinity. The emotional response of the customers is 
measured  through  the  actions  and  expressions.  The  proposed  method  takes  this  complete 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
emotional  need identification  and  embedding  emotions in  the  advertisements/news  as  a  four 
step process: 

1.  Understanding customer‚Äôs affective needs: (this is a learning phase of the algorithm.) 

While doing this, customer is presented a series of advertisements or news of his interest. 
The  variations  in  affective  components  impacting  percept  help  us  to  identify  his/her 
affective needs. An experiment is conducted for 50 candidates and five advertisements. 
For each product the variations are applied. 

2.  In case of new candidates based on their personal data the affective needs are calibrated. 
With reference to affective needs customer is presented news or advertisements. In case 
of news even series of news are also considered. Part of data which is already labeled is 
used for testing. 

3.  Finally, the representative emotional vectors and personality vectors are used to map a 

customer to the most suitable advertisement or news.  

4.  In this case corpus based on customers‚Äô emotional traits the affective components and 

features selected for embedding emotions. 

Any new candidate is  classified in the emotional range  form 1 to  5. For the convenience of 
computation we have take n from 1 to five but it can very easily be extended to bigger number 
provided we get comparable accuracy.  

4.0 RESULTS 
Emotions are embedded in the any object in different ways. In case of news it can be in the 
form of words those depict personalized emotions those can keep reader to go in details and 
read the next version of it. It could be in the form of percept in case of advertisements. It could 
be shade or color or changes in color, it could be words the way they appear, it could be words 
in the title of news  or it could even be order in  which news are presented. As discussed in 
previous  section  we  have  clustered  the  candidates  based  on  their  responses  in  different 
emotional zones. Personality vectors and emotion vectors are used for classification. We have 
collected response expressions for 500 candidates. We clustered them using affinity index.

Inclination toward reading the similar news or news in that series in the area of interest of the 
candidate is calibrated on scale 0 to 4. The news selected in such a way that ‚Äì it is a news he 
would love to read. 0 indicates complete disagreement towards reading similar news while 4 
means reader is desperate towards reading similar news. 

Data set of 10 candidates for different word clusters is given in Table 1. The same way data is 
collected for other emotional features. These clusters are used for learning. For test set data, 
personality vector is used for mapping emotional traits of individuals. Then based on cluster 
and  other  personality  analysis  of  individual  a  product  with  mapping  emotional  features  is 
presented to reader. Responses for the other combinations are also collected from customers.  

Table 2 gives comparison between actual ranks and expected ranks for given set of news. In 
60%  of cases the embedded  emotions in the  form of  text clusters as  per emotional traits of 
reader and the news is ranked as best one. In 20% of the cases there is another news reader 
ranks above this recommended news and in rest of the cases there are two or more news articles 
out of set of five news articles, reader ranks above this recommended news article.

5.0 CONCLUSION 
It‚Äôs always challenging to embed emotions into any object, news or advertisement. Color and 
Text have always been choice of researchers for their experiments. While Kansei Engineering 
focuses  on  building  personalized  products  and  have  emotions  embedded  in  the  process. 
Computationally how to measure emotions? is challenging and hence only way is to collect 
response from customer or track his emotions through expressions. Computational psychology 
experiments  were  based  on  color  selection.  In  this  paper,  we  have  proposed  a  method  for 
embedding emotions into the advertisements and news articles and experiments to measure the 
success and impact of it on readers and customers. The association and affinity index is used 
for mapping individuals to emotion vectors. The results are measured based on ranking done 
by readers and ranking done by Affinity Based Association. In most of the case the algorithm 
confirmed accuracy greater than 62%. This method can be enhanced to associate more than 
one advertisements, deciding sequence of news to achieve desired impact and also to attract 
readers.
