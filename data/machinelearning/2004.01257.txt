Abstract 

Due to the pivotal role of UV photodiodes in many technological applications in tandem with the high 
efficiency achieved by machine learning techniques in regression and classification problems, different 
artificial intelligence techniques are adopted to simulate and model the performance of organic/inor-
ganic  heterojunction  UV  photodiode.  Herein,  the  performance  of  a  fabricated  Au/NTCDA/p-Si/Al 
photodiode is explained in a detailed manner and has shown an excellent responsivity and detectivity 
for UV light of intensities; ranging from 20 to 80 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) . A linear current–irradiance relationship 
is exhibited by the fabricated photodiode under illumination up to 65 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) . It also shows good 
response times of  (cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16) = 408 (cid:5)(cid:19) and (cid:12)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:22) = 490 (cid:5)(cid:19). Furthermore, we have not only fitted the char-
acteristic I-V curve but also evaluated three classical algorithms; K-Nearest Neighbour, Artificial Neu-
ral Network, and Genetic Programming besides using a Quantum Neural Network to predict the be-
haviour of the device. The models have achieved outstanding results and managed to capture the trend 
of the target values. The Quantum Neural Network has been used for the first time to model the pho-
todiode. The models can be used instead of repeating the fabrication process. This means a reduction 
in the cost and the manufacturing time.

 Introduction 

Over the past years, the technology of optoelectronic devices based on planar organic semiconductor has wit-
nessed an escalating pace both in academia and industry. Notably, the fusion of both organic and inorganic 
materials to form the hybrid heterojunction devices has triggered a stir in the field of photodiode fabrication 
research because of their capability of tuning the spectral range of detection by changing the deposited organic 
film on the inorganic substrate [1].  From the multiple choices of planar structured organic materials, naphtha-
lenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA) has favourable features. 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhy-
dride with a planar π-stacking structure has emerged as a promising n-type organic semiconductor material for 
the organic electronics community.  

Recently, there were several studies concerning the explanation of many physical and chemical aspects of this 
compound such as the degradation mechanism, hybrid complexation with inorganics and properties of mono-
layers epitaxial grown [2–6]. Furthermore, the unique characteristics of NTCDA such as the high electron mo-
bility [7,8], the high UV absorption [9,10], the high air stability [7,11] and the obvious photocurrent multipli-
cation in optical photodiodes [12,13] recommend this material for a wide range of optoelectronic applications.  

In this framework, NTCDA is utilised in various microelectronics and optoelectronic applications such as or-
ganic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) [14], organic photodiodes [15–17], organic solar cells (OSCs) [18,19], 
organic diodes [20] and n-channel organic field-effect transistor's (OFETs) [11,21–23]. According to the fea-
tures mentioned above of NTCDA, the present study introduces a hybrid heterojunction based on NTCDA/p-Si 
for photodetection applications. 

On another side, for decades, modelling techniques that depend mainly on fitting criteria have been used in 
physics. Lately, more sophisticated approaches have been adopted to replace the fitting methods in computa-
tional physics. The work mentioned in [24–30] proves that the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and especially 
Machine Learning (ML) achieved high efficiency in modelling and fitting problems in multidiscipline areas. 
ML is considered a vital tool that transforms the way we treat and synthesise new materials. ML models; either 
straightforward algorithms or Deep Learning (DL) algorithms do not only fit the data but also can predict the 
behaviour of microelectronic devices and give us an intuition behind the inner workings of physical phenome-
non.  

In a retrospective manner, the relationship between condensed matter physics and ML can be exploited by the 
mutual benefits of using the concepts of each one to boost the progress of the other. Examples for this are the 
emergence of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) [31–33] to improve the speed of some algorithms and achieve 
higher accuracies and using ML for discovering new materials or optimising the manufacturing process for such 
materials.  

The present study introduces the utilisation of four different ML algorithms to model the behaviour of a fabri-
cated hybrid heterojunction UV photodiode. Besides that, we analyse the optoelectronic characteristics of the 
fabricated photodiode. The approach for the modelling part is based on regression analysis. This means that we 
no longer look for the lowest error rate but for a model that can generalise well enough to predict the behaviour 
of the photodiode and can be used by others to conduct their own studies without the need of repeating the 
costly manufacturing process.  

The algorithms are divided into two main groups; classical algorithms and a single quantum algorithm. The 
classical algorithms are K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) [34,35], Neural Networks (NN) [27,36], and Automated 
Machine Learning (AML) using Genetic Programming (GP) [37]. The quantum algorithm is The Continuous-
Variable (CV) Quantum Neural Network (QNN) [32]. The paper is divided as follows: the upcoming section 
will be the materials and methods where we will introduce the fabrication process and the software modelling 
requirements and procedures. In section three we will discuss the characterisation techniques and the algorithms 
for  the  modelling  part  at  length.  The  optoelectronic  analysis  and  the  merits  of  the  fabricated  photodiode

alongside the ML results from the modelling algorithms will be highlighted in section four. Finally, we will 
summarise our opinions and important results. 

2  Materials and Methods 

The architectural design of the fabricated photodiode is illustrated in Fig. 1.a, where the p-type silicon substrates 
were carefully etched and cleaned as mentioned in our earlier work [38]. The chemical structure of 1,4,5,8-
naphthalene tetracarboxylic-dianhydride, NTCDA, (cid:24)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:31) powder purchased from Alfa Aeser Company is 
shown in Fig. 1.b. A thermally evaporated thin film of NTCDA of thickness 150 !(cid:5) was deposited using the 
coating unit (model: Edwards 306A-England) at 1 " 10#$ (cid:5)%&’ and room temperature. Then, a 50 !(cid:5)-thick 
gold top electrode was deposited on NTCDA thin film using a shadow mask in the form of a mesh. Finally, a 
thick aluminium bottom electrode of thickness 300 !(cid:5) was deposited on the backside of the Si-substrate.

The software language used in this research is Python 3.6. We have used Keras, Scikit-Learn, Pennylane, and 
Strawberryfields [39–42] to model the characteristics of the photodiode. For verification and replicating the 
results, the code and the dataset are available on our GitHub repository.

  Characterisation techniques 

The optical absorbance of NTCDA thin film on a quartz substrate was measured at normal incidence of the light 
at room temperature in the spectral range of 190– 2500 !(cid:5) using a double beam spectrophotometer (JASCO 
model V-570 UV-VIS-NIR). The Photoelectrical properties – of the fabricated Au/NTCDA/p-Si/Al photodiode 
– were investigated by measuring the I-V characteristic curve at room temperature from +3.5 , to -3.4 , using 
Keithley electrometer model 6517B under the influence of UV light of wavelength 194 !(cid:5). The intensity of 
incident light was measured using the Radiometer / Photometer model IL1400A. 

  Modelling procedures 

3.2.1  Data inspection 

The approach for this section is entirely data-driven and is built on publicly available software. We adopted the 
standard pipeline for ML which consists of data acquisition, data cleansing, feature Engineering and pre-pro-
cessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and validation and testing. In our case, the first two steps have 
been done using Keithley electrometer model 6517B. To decide what feature pre-processing method should be 
used, we must conduct an explanatory data analysis (EDA) approach; so that we can summarise the character-
istics and the insights of the dataset.

Based on the dataset characteristics that are represented in table 1, one can speculate about the model and its 
properties and then find a suitable range of parameters to tune the model against a fitness function to have the 
optimum set of values for it. Finally, the model can be validated and tested against out of sample data.

In table. 1, most of the essential statistics have been summed up. The dataset consists of 828 samples and three 
attributes; the first two attributes are the predictors and the 3rd one – which is current – is the response. Due to 
the vast differences between the first two features, the interquartile range (IQR) method has been chosen to 
scale the features before using them.

tion intensities, b) the kernel density distribution of the current based on different illumination intensities.  

Based on Fig. 2, one can assume that despite the strong correlation between the voltage and the resulted current, 
the illumination intensity does affect the current distribution and hence there is a nonlinear relationship between 
the current and the illumination. Fig. 2.b represents the kernel distribution of the obtained values of the current 
at different illuminating intensities and confirms the nonlinear relation between them. Moreover, upon increas-
ing the illumination intensity, the distribution function becomes broader. The obvious left-skewness is a typical 
asset of the organic/inorganic heterojunction devices. The absence of the sudden change in the positive side of

the current distribution and smooth distribution at 50 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) confirms that the fabricated device shows its 
optimal performance at this illuminating intensity. 

3.2.2  Model selection 

Regarding  the  model  selection  step,  different  types  of  regression  models  have  been  examined  and  they  are 
divided into two main groups; parametric models such as linear [43] and polynomial models [44] and nonpara-
metric models such as KNN, Random Forest [45] and Support Vector Regression (SVR) [46], except for linear 
and polynomial kernels. 

Herein, the parametric models are not a proper choice in the current regression problem, where the linear re-
gression model is expressed in the closed-form solution as: 







T
X X



 1

T
X Y

,

(1) 

where X is an m × n matrix, and Y is a vector of size (cid:5)  "  1. From Eq. (1), it is evident that the linear model 
assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables, and it assumes a homosce-
dastic pattern in the response variable. These two properties alone clarify why a linear model is not a proper 
choice for modelling the diode’s behaviour.  

On the other hand, nonparametric models do not assume a pre-determined form of the independent and the 
dependent variables. Instead, it learns the structure of the data itself. Moreover, a parametric model is described 
by a finite set of parameters, unlike other nonparametric models whose complexity depends mainly on the fea-
ture space of the dataset. Hence, according to the nonlinearity and the limited size of our dataset, the nonpara-
metric regression models are more convenient. 

A KNN model is chosen to be the fitting model because it does not assume an explicit form for the training data. 
Moreover, the testing time for such a model is (cid:29)(cid:24)HI  -  HJ(cid:31) [47] where H is the number of samples (828), J 
is the number of features (voltage and illumination intensity), and K is the number of the closest points to the 
query testing sample. This means that the testing time is very fast on a typical CPU backend. The algorithm 
uses the inverse distance weighted average of the KNNs. There are different metrics, but the most general one 
(cid:31)(cid:26)/O where M,
is the Minkowski distance metric which is defined by the following equation: (cid:24)∑ |M(cid:14) + N(cid:14)|O
N ∈ ℝ(cid:9). Furthermore, depending on the U value, one can choose between the Euclidean, Manhattan, and Che-
byshev metrics.  

P
(cid:14)Q(cid:26)

For hyper-parameter tuning, an exhaustive grid search technique was chosen for selecting the best K value, the 
distance metric  and  its  corresponding U  value,  and  the  underlying algorithm that is  used for  calculating  the 
distances such as K-D Tree, Ball Tree, and Brute Force, based on a cross-validation score of 13-folds. The 
fitness function for the grid search is the mean squared error metric. The V(cid:9) score is also evaluated to check for 
the goodness of the fit [48]. 

The earlier approach, as will be discussed in the results section, achieves an excellent job in fitting the I-V data 
and reached an acceptable minimum error rate. However, our hopeful aim to obtain a lower error rate rather 
than that resulted from the KNN is still needed. Hence, another approach was adopted.

3.2.3  Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 

The second modelling technique in the classical approach is ANN. ANN consists of small units called neurons 
which act as the neurons inside our brains. As shown in Fig. 3, one can formulate an equation that can describe 
it as follows: 

Fig. 3: The working mechanism of a single neuron “perceptron”.


(

 
w x b

),

(2) 

where y is the output, w is the weight, x is a training sample, b is the bias, and W is the activation function [49]. 
According to the universality theory [50,51], using connected layers made of neurons enables us to approximate 
any known function and fit its data. An example of such a network is the multilayer perceptron or a feedforward 
neural network as depicted in Fig. 4 which consists of an input layer, an output layer, and more than one hidden 
layer.  

  The size of the input and the output layers depends on the problem definition which – in our case – is two 
neurons and one neuron, respectively. Determining the size of the hidden layers and the neurons in each one of 
them is still an open debate [52,53]. Hence, we empirically chose those numbers; starting from a shallow net-
work with a small number of units towards the current shape depicted in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4: Feedforward neural network architecture, where the faint colours indicate extremely low weights. The number of hidden layers 
in this model is 4. Further details can be found in the repository. 

A feedback mechanism which is called backpropagation [54] is used to update the weights of each layer de-
pending on the optimiser updating rule. The output from a neuron is just its activation’s output, i.e. for an input 
 which would be the input of ! - 1

layer as follows:

where W is the nonlinear activation function, and X is the weight matrix between n and ! - 1 layer. Setting 
!  =  1 to be the first layer and H to be the last layer, we can then move to the next step which is backpropaga-
tion. Let us first define a cost function Y:

using Eq. (6), we can formulate a relation that describes how it is possible to propagate the errors backwards

Intuitively, the error at the last layer is just the cost function multiplied by the derivative of the activation func-
tion. Finally, the third step takes care of updating the weights matrix according to the derivative between the 
cost function and the weights. This procedure is repeated until convergence occurs. The updates of the weight 
matrix are calculated using the Adam optimiser [55]. The activation function for all the layers – except the last 
one – is the RELU function [49]. The output layer’s activation function is linear. The default parameters of the 
Adam’s algorithm are left unchanged. Features are usually normalised between 1 and +1 before feeding them 
to the network. However, we have scaled them according to their mean and standard deviation, and that helped 
with making the convergence time a little shorter.

To overcome the difficulties of the earlier two approaches; data pre-processing and choosing the proper model, 
a more automated approach can help to decrease the time of data inspection, feature pre-processing and model 
selection. Hence, an AML technique is adopted [37]. 

3.2.4  Automated machine learning using Genetic programming 

An automated approach is used to find the best modelling pipeline for the fabricated device. Tree-based Pipeline 
Optimisation Tool (TPOT) is an AML library that depends on (GP) [56] which is a well-known technique in 
Evolutionary Algorithms [57]. TPOT does the tedious job of pre-processing the data, feature engineering, model 
selection, hyper-parameter tuning, validation and finally testing. The idea lies in creating multiple copies of the 
dataset and feeding it to different pipelines in a tree-fashion way. It follows a simple procedure as follows: 

i. 
ii. 
iii. 

The initialisation of the population, randomly, to be the first generation. 
Evaluation of the cost – fitness – function to check for the best individuals. 
Repeating the same procedure again but with some restriction parameters such as time, mutation, cross-
over, and selection criteria to dump the weakest individuals and breed a new generation “the offspring.”  

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The problem behind this approach is that in each run a new pipeline can be produced. That is the reason why 
we had it run several times, and the only thing we needed is to test each one to see if it is a good fit for our case. 
The chosen pipeline of this approach performs very well in terms of extrapolating unseen data and has an ac-
ceptable error rate. Moreover, it used the same regressor method that has been chosen for the first method. The 
big drawback was that it produced overfitted pipelines so that we had to pay careful attention to the value of the 
number of cross-validations and the population size. Further details are present in the results section.  

The resulted pipeline as shown in Fig. 5 has three stages; the first one is modifying the data by copying it and 
adding a new predicted value by the XGBoost regressor [58], the second one is a feature union between the first 
stage and the data itself so that we have five features instead of two, the third stage is the estimator itself which 
is a KNN for the final prediction.

3.2.5  Quantum neural network (QNN) 

Despite the considerable advancements in quantum computing technologies and the exciting and fruitful race 
between giant tech companies, quantum computers are still noisy and cannot operate at room temperatures. That 
is why we are living in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ) era [59]. ML helps us to take 
full advantage of these devices despite their imperfect behaviour. Using a hybrid quantum-classical computa-
tional model [60,61] paves the way for using the classical part to do the repeated procedures that require memory 
and error-correcting subroutines whereas the quantum part performs the complex intractable classical opera-
tions. 

Different software libraries provide this framework of computation. Pennylane [41] is an example of these li-
braries. It presents the concept of a quantum node (Qnode) where you can perform an operation by providing 
the inputs to the parameterised gates and then measure the desired observable. In this manner, the Qnode is not 
interrupted until we perform the measurement. This concept of hybrid computation makes it easier to realise a 
fully QNN where the backpropagation step is computed on the classical part and the feedforward step is com-
puted on the quantum computer. Pennylane also provides a means to calculate the gradients of the quantum 
gates without the need for any classical interference [62]. 

Relating  the  aforementioned  idea  to  the  typical  ML  pipeline,  we  need  to  determine  the  way  of  feeding  the 
classical data into the quantum device and to choose a proper model for the task. There are two main techniques 
in quantum information science to process the data; the Qubit model and the CV model [63–66]. Since our data 
are continuous, the CV model is chosen. 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the CV model, the information can be represented by the phase-space formalism [67,68], instead of the wave-
function formalism [69]. The former method is used as it’s more convenient for our case. Generally, in this 
context, the data is encoded in terms of the M\ and Û quadratures which satisfy the canonical relations by setting 
ℏ = 2:

where &\ and &\_ are the annihilation and the creation operators, respectively. The basic state that can be converted 
into any desired state is the Vacuum state |0⟩.  The CV model has a set of gates that can be used to perform any 
mathematical operation or prepare any state. Moreover, due to its nature of processing the information, nonlinear 
gates are naturally present and are used to express its universality [70,71].  

(cid:26)/(cid:9)jk∗(cid:21)l#k(cid:21)el

The single Qumode gates are called the Displacement gate a(cid:24)b(cid:31) =   c(cid:24)d(cid:21)e#d∗(cid:21)(cid:31) where b ∈  ℂ, the Squeezing 
m  where  i = ’c(cid:14)n,  and  the  Rotation  gate  V(cid:24)o(cid:31) = c(cid:14)p(cid:21)e(cid:21)  where  o ∈ q0,2rs.  The 
gate  h(cid:24)i(cid:31) = c
nonlinear gates are the Kerr gate Ituvw =   c(cid:14)x(cid:24)(cid:21)e(cid:21)(cid:31)lwhere u ∈ ℝ and the Cubic Phase gate ,(cid:24)y(cid:31) = c
m 
where y ∈ ℝ [63,64,68,72]. The nonlinear gates help with constructing higher-order Hamiltonians which are an 
incredible feat over the Qubit model, and one does not require more than a single variable nonlinear gate for 
this construction.

The architecture of the QNN is adapted from [32]. As depicted in Fig. 6, we are only using one Qumode with a 
repeated block of gates. Each block represents a layer in terms of classical neural networks. The classical data 
is embedded in the quantum device by preparing a Displaced Squeezed state |b, i⟩ where b, i  ∈  ℂ [73]. It is 
created by applying a Squeezing gate then followed by a Displacement gate. 

Fig. 6: The configuration of the quantum circuit used for modelling. The grouped gates represent a single layer of the 
QNN. The dashed box is repeated 8 times. The ’ in the state preparation represents the magnitude of the squeezing gate. 

Embedding classical data into quantum states is an active area of research [74,75]. Since we are only interested 
in  measuring  the  M\  quadrature  and  we’re  simulating  a  classical  NN  within  a  quantum  framework,  only  the 
absolute values of b and i are being used to encode the classical data of the I-V curve. The voltage values are 
scaled between [-1.1, 1] to be embedded by the displacement gate. The illumination values are scaled between 
q0, 0.8s to be used as the squeezing magnitudes. 

This scheme of data encoding is depicted in Fig. 7.a where the Wigner function has been plotted for a Displaced 
Squeezed  state  of  the  values  | + 1.0, 0.8⟩  and  the  learned  state  of  the  QNN  after  applying  the  parametrised 
circuit as shown in Fig. 7.b.  In terms of the quadratures, this would resemble a translation in the M\ ⟶ hM\ - J 
where h is the Squeezing gate and its effect is simply narrowing the M\ quadrature by c#(cid:13) and ’ is the ℜc(cid:24)i(cid:31), 
whereas J is the ℜc(cid:24)b(cid:31) and it translates the M\ from the origin by its magnitude. On the other hand, the Û quad-
rature is only affected by the h gate as it is stretching by c(cid:13).

When the illumination is zero, then the prepared state is simply a Coherent state which acts as a radial basis 
kernel. This mapping procedure serves the regression problem we are trying to solve as we are only using a 
single Qumode to follow the architecture of [32]. 

Following the same footsteps of classical NNs, this leaves us with determining the number of layers, the learning 
rate, the size of each batch and weight initialisation. The parametrised circuit consists of 8 layers; each layer 
consists of 5 parameters, i.e. it only has 40 parameters to be updated by the Adam optimiser. The batch size is 
32, and we tried different settings for the learning rate starting from 0.001 to 0.01. The weight initialisation 
was drawn from a random sample distribution with a standard deviation ranging from q10#(cid:27), 10#(cid:9)s. The cut-
off range was set to 18 for the Fock space.

negative values in Wigner function which indicates the effect of the non-linear effect of the Kerr gate.

4  Results and Discussion 

  Optical Characteristics of NTCDA Thin Film 

For  inspecting  the  most  suitable  spectral  range  of  detection,  the  optical  absorbance  of  NTCDA  thin  film  is 
measured in the range 190 + 2500 !(cid:5). The absorption profile shown in Fig. 8.a confirms the high UV absorp-
tion of NTCDA extended to the visible range with very low IR absorption. As observed from the inset of Fig. 
8.a, the intensity of the UV absorption peaks is more significant than that of the visible region which suggests 
a good selectivity to detect even a weak UV signal in a robust visible light background.  

The featured absorption peaks exhibited in the NTCDA absorption spectra implies the massive generation of 
photoexcited charge carriers in the NTCDA thin film. This leads to a high photocurrent and a high photore-
sponse photodetector. The optical band gap energy is estimated using absorption spectrum fitting (ASF) proce-
dures [78,79]. The value of the indirect energy gap can be estimated by extrapolating the linear portion of the 
plot of (cid:24)(cid:128)%(cid:19). (cid:129)#(cid:26)(cid:31)(cid:26)/(cid:9) versus(cid:129)#(cid:26) to [(cid:24)(cid:128)%(cid:19). (cid:129)#(cid:26)(cid:31)(cid:26)/(cid:9) = 0] as depicted in Fig. 8.b which is corresponding to 1/(cid:129)(cid:130)
, 
  is  the  wavelength  related  to  the  energy  gap.  The  optical  band  energy  can  be  estimated  by  [Y(cid:130) =
where  (cid:129)(cid:130)
]. The estimated values for the onset energy gap and the optical energy gap are about 2.84, and 3.75 c,, 
ℎ(cid:8)/(cid:129)(cid:130)
respectively.

  Electrical Characteristics of Au/NTCDA/p-Si/Al Photodiode 

Fig. 9 depicts the semi-logarithmic current-voltage relation of Au/NTCDA/p-Si/ Al photodiode under the dark 
and illumination conditions at room temperature. A distinct rectification behaviour is obtained with ~3 and ~ 4 
for dark and 80 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) irradiance at ± 3.5 V, respectively. A monotonic increase in the produced photocur-
rent is accompanied by the increase of light intensity. This increase emphasises the formation of neutral Frenkel 
excitons which dissociate generating free electrons and holes which are swept under the influence of the biasing 
voltage [38,80].

The thermionic emission theory was employed to fit the linear region of the forward-biased I-V curve at low

The ideality factor, !, was estimated from the slope of the linear region of the I-V curve in forward biasing with 
neglecting the series resistance in the low voltage region ,(cid:132)   <  0.18 , using the following relation [38]:

Upon illumination, the estimated values of the ideality factor were decreased from 4.98 (in the dark) to 3.78 
(under 80 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) irradiance). The high values of ideality factor over-unity may be attributed to many factors 
such as the tunnelling process [82], the image-forces effect [83], series resistance [84], inhomogeneity of barrier 
height and the existence of interface states [85,86]. Herein, the series resistance and the interfacial layer exist-
ence have the primary responsibility of the high value of ideality factor. Moreover, a slight increase in the values 
of zero-bias barrier height from 0.7 c, (in the dark) to 0.72 c, (under 80 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) irradiance) which may be 
attributed to the passivation of Si surface by NTCDA [81]. 

Inherently, the series resistance has a crucial impact on the performance of any electronic device, where these 
types  of  devices  always  exhibit  a  high  series  resistance.    In  this  essence,  many  models  were  developed  to 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
estimate the values of series resistance, but each model has its limitations [87]. Subsequently, the series re-
sistance of the fabricated device was estimated using a modified Nord's model, which is applicable to the whole 
voltage range [86–89]. 

A significant decrement in the series resistance from 2.96 u(cid:139) to 0.10 u(cid:139) upon increasing the illumination in-
tensity from 0 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) to 80 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) is observed. This decrement may be explained as follows; under the 
influence of illumination, the photo-generated charge carriers would be trapped at either at p-Si/NTCDA inter-
face or NTCDA/ electrode interface. Increasing the illumination intensity increases the density of photo-gener-
ated charge carriers and decreases the probability of trapping charges, decreasing the series resistance [86,90]. 

The estimated high values of ideality factor indicate that thermionic emission is no longer suitable for interpret-
ing the transport mechanism, so to investigate the operating charge transport mechanisms in Au/NTCDA/p-
Si/Al photodiode, the double logarithmic relation between current and the voltage in forward biasing in dark 
and under 80 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) irradiance are plotted as shown in Fig. 10.a. Two distinct regions with different slopes 
are obtained; region (I) of slope equals one and region (II) of slope equals 2.62. The dominant transport mech-
anism in the region (I) is the Ohmic transport mechanism [91], while in the region (II) the dominant transport 
mechanism is the space charge limited conduction (SCLC) that is dependent on trap level density and interface 
states [91,92].

  Optoelectronic Characteristics of Au/NTCDA/p-Si/Al Photodiode 

An explicit investigation of photosensitivity of the fabricated photodiode was performed by studying the de-
pendence of photocurrent density, (cid:151)(cid:152)[
, on illumination intensity at different biasing voltages as shown in Fig. 
11.a. The fabricated device exhibits a linear performance with the irradiance up to 65 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9), but exceeding 
this limit makes the photodiode saturates. The linearity of photocurrent density and irradiance relation is more 
obvious in the high biasing voltages than lower voltages. Fig. 11.b shows the double logarithmic relation be-
tween the photocurrent, (cid:141)(cid:152)[
, and incident power, (cid:153), where the estimated slopes (~1.4) conclude that this archi-
tecture can be utilised in optoelectronic applications to detect low-intensity signals.

where NEP is the noise equivalent power. Fig. 12 shows the voltage dependence of responsivity, specific de-
tectivity, external quantum efficiency and noise current at different illumination intensities. An apparent in-
crease of responsivity, specific detectivity, and external quantum efficiency with increasing the illumination 
intensity up to 65 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9), which means that this architecture operates for detecting a light signal of illumi-
nation  lower  than  65 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9).  The  decrease  of  photoresponsivity  of  the  fabricated  device  at  intensity 
80 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) may be attributed to the decrease of sufficient photo-induced trap states density at the interface 
[94].  

  The calculated specific detectivity which determines the resolution limit that the detector can distinguish 
from  the  noise  [95]  is  in  the  range  of  109  Jones  as  shown  in  Fig.  12.b  which  proves  the  sensitivity  of  the 
fabricated  device  [94].  From  Fig.  12.c,  the  EQE  of  the  fabricated  photodiode  records  the  highest  value  at 
65 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) illumination and +3.5 , biasing voltage. Inherently, there are three contributions to noise current 
in photodetector that should be considered; thermal noise or Johnson noise current ((cid:141)(cid:151)), shot noise current ((cid:141)hℎ) 
and flicker noise current ((cid:141)(cid:155)(cid:140)) [96].  

  The estimated values of noise current were about 0.4 U(cid:128) and 7 U(cid:128) at 0 , and +3 ,, respectively. The ab-
sence of effective influence of the light intensity on the noise current, as shown in Fig. 12.d proves that the shot 
noise from dark current density is the main responsible for noises in the photodiode [96,97]. Table 2 shows a 
comparison study between the estimated parameters of the present device and earlier work.

The photoresponse speed of any optical device plays a crucial role in evaluating its optoelectronic performance, 
where almost all the optical devices require picking up a light signal with a certain bandwidth with fast response. 
The photoresponse speed which measures the quickness of extracting the photo-generated charge carriers to the

external electrical circuit is dependent on many factors such as active layer thickness, the choice of interfacial 
layer material and applied biasing voltage [102]. 

 Fig. 13 shows the transient photocurrent response of the fabricated photodiode under the influence of the square 
UV signal of 0.1 Hz frequency at different illumination intensities and 1V biasing voltage. The illustrated time-
tracked photocurrent is evidence of the strong and fast photoresponse of the existing architecture with good 
repetition and stability. Furthermore, it is observed that Au/NTCDA/p-Si/Al photodiode has a residual photo-
current in the OFF state which increases slightly with increasing the illumination intensity.  

This may be explained in terms of enhancement of NTCDA photoconductivity due to photo-thermal energy 
emitted of the incident light [86]. Fig. 14(a-d) reveals the fall time and rise time assessment for the fabricated 
photodiode under 20, 35, 65 and 80 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) illuminating intensity. A clear decrease in fall and rise times is 
noticed upon increasing the illumination intensity. Moreover, the ON/OFF ratio for different irradiance values 
at  different  reverse  biasing  voltages  is  estimated  as  shown  in  Fig.  14.e.  For  high  irradiance  values  (>
 20 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9)), the most appropriate biasing voltage is 1, to get a higher ON/OFF ratio, while at 20 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9) 
increasing the applied voltage increases the ON/OFF ratio.

  Modelling the Optoelectronic Characteristics of Au/NTCDA/p-Si/Al Photodiode 

To make our results reproducible and consistent, we paid careful attention to the randomness that may occur 
while splitting the data into training and testing sets or even the stochastic nature of the NNs. Moreover, we 
trained all the algorithms on the same partitioning so that we can compare the performance of each one with the 
others. We set 15% of the data to be the testing set and the other 85% to be the training data. The traditional 
ML algorithms were adopted from Scikit-Learn and TPOT. For the ANN part, Keras was used. Pennylane and 
StrawberryFields were used to model the QNN and to study its characteristics. The results of the four models 
are presented in table 3. 

In Fig. 15, the connected coloured lines represent the prediction of the trained model and the scattered points 
are the target values. Fig. 15.a depicts the predictions of the KNN model. It achieved an MSE of 2.67  "   10#(cid:26)(cid:26) 
and the training error is 0. The 0 error is typical behaviour from such a model as the training procedure simply 
memorises the data. The IQR pre-processing step was the best way for preparing the data for the KNN. The 
model’s parameters are I = 4, U =  4. The metric function is the Minkowski, and the searching algorithm is 
the Brute Force.

Despite  being fed  with raw  data  directly, the  predicted  curves  of  the  TPOT  in Fig  15.b shows  very similar 
behaviour to the KNN model since the last step of the pipeline is also a KNN regressor. Even though the vali-
dation error is lower than the one in the KNN case, the testing error is higher in the TPOT model. That arises 
from the fact that the TPOT training procedure tends to overfit the training data. To avoid such a scenario, we 
had to configure its dictionary of parameters to remove specific methods of feature engineering such as Radial 
Basis Function Sampler and Polynomial Features. We also changed the generation parameter to be 50 and the 
crossover to be 0.15. 

Fig. 15.c depicts the prediction of the ANN model. Due to the stochastic nature of the NN training, the loss kept 
oscillating but with a minimal variance after 10000 epochs as depicted in Fig. 16.a. With a batch size of 32, a 
learning rate of 10#ƒ, and 6 layers, the ANN achieved the lowest error rate on the testing set 1.0897  "   10#(cid:26)(cid:26). 
The ANN is the most complex model with approximately 10ƒ optimised parameters. This approach alongside 
the earlier two models can efficiently model the photodiode’s behaviour. Their results were tested analytically, 
and they produced the same figures in sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3. 

In Fig 15.d, the QNN predicted curves are plotted and in Fig. 16.b the training and testing losses are depicted. 
The QNN model didn’t produce the best results since the target values are extremely small, and we only used 
the values that affect the M\-quadrature only. However, with a single Qumode and only 40 parameters, we man-
aged to simulate what the ANN has achieved. Moreover, the loss function only took less than 500 epochs to 
reach the lowest error rate for both testing and training errors with a smooth curve. This means a higher conver-
gence rate than the classical ANN. In addition to that, the QNN didn’t overfit the training data and managed to 
capture the real trend of the I-V curve by predicting extremely small values when the input data were zero for 
the Displacement parameter. 

We had to scale the target values by a factor of 10ƒ because of two reasons. The first one is that the difference 
between the expectation values is very small for the prepared quantum states that have a small input voltage. 
The second reason is that the optimiser tends to update the active set of parameters; the Displacement and the 
Squeezing gates’ parameters, with high values so that the expectation value would be small enough, and the 
loss function would become smaller. To prevent the optimiser from increasing the active parameters we added 
a regularisation term to the loss function of Eq. (4) as follows:

where N is the target value and |§⟩ is ¤(cid:24)'(cid:31)|b, i⟩ i.e. after applying the parameterised quantum circuit to the 
initialised quantum state and ' represents the variational parameters that are being optimised. The second term 
consists of (cid:129) which has been chosen to be 0.01 and the rest is the trace of the quantum system for each sample. 
If the trace is equal to 1, the loss function reduces to the form of Eq. (4). This added term preserves the sanity 
of the quantum state within the truncated Fock space and keeps it normalised. We also avoided using the Cubic 
Phase gate as it made us increase the truncation space to be beyond 20 for a healthy quantum system. However, 
the convergence rate is faster using the cubic phase gate.

In terms of practical software developments, the TPOT method is the easiest one to be used as it only requires 
having a basic knowledge of software programming and a solid understanding of different fitting metrics and 
criteria. The rest is completely automated by its internal API. The KNN model requires a solid understanding 

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of ML basics and how to prepare the data for such a distance-based algorithm. The last two algorithms require 
an expert level especially the QNN model. In terms of pure fitting criteria, we recommend the KNN model – 
with a higher number of u-folds for hyperparameter tuning – to be the go-to model for such situations.

5  Conclusion 

Organic/inorganic heterojunction based on NTCDA/p-Si is successfully fabricated for UV light detection man-
ner. According to the obtained values of spectral responsivity, linear-dynamic range, specific detectivity, signal 
to noise ratio, and response time for the fabricated photodiode under the influence of UV light of intensity 20 +

80 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9), the current device is suggested for many optoelectronic applications. These obtained results en-
sure that the optimum light intensity – where this detector works efficiently – is 50 (cid:5)(cid:6)/(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:9).  

Regarding the modelling section of this research, adopting a regression analysis approach resulted in three ac-
curate classical algorithms that can be used to model and predict the behaviour of the fabricated device. These 
models can both extrapolate and interpolate unknown current values under different illuminations and voltage 
settings. Furthermore, they can predict extreme values near zero voltage with a minimal error rate. This can help 
other researchers conduct their studies without going through the costly manufacturing process.  

Using the fourth model, i.e. the QNN, we managed experimentally to show the superiority of the Qumode as it 
can encode floating-point data easily. In addition to that, a single Qumode – with only 40 parameters – has the 
capability of reproducing what a classical fully connected NN can do with thousands of parameters. This is a 
powerful indicator of the universality of the CV-QNN model.  

In our future work, we will explore the possibility to combine the QNN and the ANN into a single computational 
paradigm. In addition to that, we will study the effect of data embedding on the result. It will be an interesting 
direction if we study the characteristics of the material itself using ML and quantum computing to explore much 
more possibilities and discover new materials.
