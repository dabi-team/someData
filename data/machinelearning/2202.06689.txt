ABSTRACT
Code completion is an essential feature of IDEs, yet current auto-
completers are restricted to either grammar-based or NLP-based
single token completions. Both approaches have significant draw-
backs: grammar-based autocompletion is restricted in dynamically-
typed language environments, whereas NLP-based autocompleters
struggle to understand the semantics of the programming language
and the developer’s code context.

In this work, we present CodeFill, a language model for autocom-
pletion that combines learned structure and naming information.
Using a parallel Transformer architecture and multi-task learning,
CodeFill consumes sequences of source code token names and their
equivalent AST token types. Uniquely, CodeFill is trained both for
single-token and multi-token (statement) prediction, which enables
it to learn long-range dependencies among grammatical and nam-
ing elements. We train CodeFill on two datasets, consisting of 29M
and 425M lines of code, respectively. To make the evaluation more
realistic, we develop a method to automatically infer points in the
source code at which completion matters. We compare CodeFill
against four baselines and two state-of-the-art models, GPT-C and
TravTrans+. CodeFill surpasses all baselines in single token predic-
tion (MRR: 70.9% vs. 66.2% and 67.8%) and outperforms the state of
the art for multi-token prediction (ROUGE-L: 63.7% vs. 52.4% and
59.2%, for 𝑛 = 4 tokens). We publicly release our source code and
datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION
Automatic code completion (also called autocompletion) is the task
of completing source code statements by predicting what the de-
veloper would write given the current context. It helps developers
finish their programming tasks faster by decreasing the typing ef-
fort and saving keystrokes, correcting typographical errors, and
enabling them to explore APIs in a context-sensitive manner [5]. Au-
tocompletion has therefore emerged as one of the most prominent
features in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

To support autocompletion, current IDEs exploit the regular
structure of programming languages. For example, an IDE knows
that an opening parenthesis character (‘(‘) at a function-call posi-
tion must be followed by enough arguments to match the function’s
arity. It can therefore propose argument names for variables that
are in scope. The availability of types in the host programming
language helps increase the precision of suggestions; continuing
with the example above, the IDE will only propose variable names
for variables whose types match the function argument. Recent au-
tocompletion systems also take into account past completions [43]
and analyze large code bases [9] to rank suggestions according to
their past popularity. Despite the best efforts of researchers and
IDE developers, developers find rule-based code completion mecha-
nisms lacking. Ranking suggestions based on alphabetical or usage
frequency (or even the suggestion list length [23]) neglects the
current context, leading to unrelated recommendations [3]. These
problems are exacerbated in dynamically typed language settings,
as the IDE is lacking significant information to provide accurate
suggestions.

To mitigate rule-based autocompletion issues, researchers have
proposed statistical [17, 37] and learning-based [6, 17, 29, 31, 32, 51]
autocompletion models. Motivated by the naturalness hypothe-
sis [19], learning-based models treat source code as natural lan-
guage text, hence code completion becomes an instance of the
well-studied text completion problem. However, treating source
code as text deprives learning-based models of important code
structure and semantic information [18]. Moreover, the open-ended
nature of code leads to extremely large prediction spaces due to
developers constantly inventing identifier names [24].

In an illuminating study, Hellendoorn et al. [18] identified a set
of issues with current research in code completion. Initially, the
current approach of evaluating accuracy as masked token prediction
does not reflect how autocompletion is used; developers only trigger
autocompletion after specific, and certainly not arbitrary, points
in a program’s syntax (e.g., after an opening parenthesis). Thus,
treating all tokens equally masks the fact that some tokens (e.g.,
punctuation) are much easier to predict than others (e.g., identifiers).
Moreover, most approaches (especially learning-based ones) do not

Izadi, et al.

account for names coming from dependencies, which deprives them
of important context.

In this work, we propose CodeFill, a novel learning-based ap-
proach that aims to address the problems identified above. CodeFill
borrows from the bimodality hypothesis [12] to model source code
inputs. Specifically, CodeFill exploits that information is conveyed
by source code through two channels; the natural language chan-
nel (variable names, functions, etc.), and the code structure channel
(inheritance, containment, etc.). Inputs are fed into the model si-
multaneously as both sequences of token values, which enable it to
learn relationships among token values, and, uniquely, sequences of
token types, which enable it to learn associations between syntactic
elements. CodeFill is then asked to predict either the value or the
type of the next n tokens. To enable CodeFill to learn name depen-
dencies across longer ranges, we also train it with an additional
task, multi-token statement completion at the value level. The input
token names to CodeFill is encoded with Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE),
which enables CodeFill to both compress the input name space and
generate names that are not in the input vocabulary. To present
suggestions relevant to the developer’s context, CodeFill includes
a post-processing step that re-ranks the predictions based on the
context visible to the model at the completion point. CodeFill is in-
stantiated as a set of three Transformers (GPT2-based) trained with
soft parameter sharing Multi-Task Learning (MTL) setting. Each
transformer models one of the three tasks, namely token value,
token type, and multi-token prediction; a joint loss function across
all three tasks updates the weights of all three model components.
During each epoch, the model is trained on one task according to a
configurable task-picking policy. Our target language is Python, to
both demonstrate the efficiency of the model when type informa-
tion is missing and also make our work comparable with the state
of the art.

We pit CodeFill against four baseline models and two the-state-
of-the-art models, namely GPT-C [49] and TravTrans+ [25]. We
use two deduplicated datasets: the ETH150K dataset (deduplicated:
PY117K) and a manually collected dataset consisting of practically
all non-forked Python repositories on GitHub (PY1690K). We eval-
uate all models on two tasks: Token-Level and Statement-Level Pre-
dictions (TLP and SLP). For TLP, we evaluate for i) next token
prediction (TLP-A), ii) next token type prediction (TLP-B), iii) next
token value prediction (TLP-C). To ensure that the evaluation set-
ting reflects real-world use of autocompletion, we also evaluate
completions after specific syntactic elements, e.g., a dot . or an
AWAIT keyword (TLP-D). We devise an algorithm to identify those
syntactic elements (cardinal points) automatically given a corpus.
We use top-1 Accuracy and the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) as
evaluation metrics. For the SLP task, we assess the models on state-
ment completion with 𝑛 tokens and we compare them using ME-
TEOR and ROUGE-L measures. To show that each component in
the CodeFill model is necessary, we perform an ablation study.

The results demonstrate that CodeFill outperforms all the com-
peting approaches in all tasks. Indicatively, for each of the TPL-A,
TPL-B, TPL-C, and TPL-D evaluation tasks, CodeFill achieves a
state of the art MRR of 81.7%, 87.2%, 69.5%, 70.2% while TravTrans+,
a current state of the art, scores 79.4%, 83.6%, 63.8%, and 66.2%,
respectively. In the SLP evaluation task, for completing statements
with four tokens (the average completion length in our datasets)

CodeFill obtains 70.2% and 63.8% for the METEOR and ROUGE-L
metrics respectively, and thus significantly surpasses TravTrans+
(64.5% and 52.4%).

The main contributions of this work are:

• CodeFill, a model that unifies learning of structural and

name-based information for the autocompletion task.

• An implementation of CodeFill, including training proce-
dures, for the Python programming language. We make our
code and datasets available. 1

• An extensive evaluation of CodeFill against four baseline
models and two state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating
its superior performance.

2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In this section, we briefly review the background work relating to
our approach. Then, we present the main approaches to autocom-
pletion, including the baselines we used for comparison.

2.1 Language Models and Transformers
Statistical Language Modeling (LM) is the task of developing a
probabilistic model for predicting the next tokens in a sequence
given its preceding tokens, i.e., the context [14]. This context for
simpler LMs is a short sequence of words, while it can be sentences
or paragraphs for larger models [46]. LMs are either used without
modification, e.g., in a text generation task, or used inside a down-
stream task which requires language understanding. Programming
languages also contain predictable statistical properties which can
be learned using LMs [19].

Recently, Neural LMs have gained popularity due to their supe-
rior performance and generalization capabilities [14, 35]. Neural
LMs address the n-gram data sparsity problem through param-
eterization of words as vectors [26]. A real-valued vector (word
embedding) is used to represent each word in a vector space. This
representation of words is learned based on their usage. This allows
words with a similar meaning to have a similar representation. Note
that traditional statistical LMs were not able to achieve this level
of generalization [47]. Moreover, the distributed representation ap-
proach makes it easier for the embedding representation to scale
with the vocabulary size. This is specifically useful with source
code, where the vocabulary size can be unlimited due to the use of
arbitrary identifiers. Initially, feed-forward neural network mod-
els, then Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and next, networks
with long-term memory, such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
networks were used.

Most recently, there have been significant improvements with
the introduction of self-attention architectures in the Transformer
which is a sequence-to-sequence architecture for transforming a
given sequence of elements to another form [53]. Attention enable
Transformers to focus on selective parts of an input, thus generating
more relevant outputs [34]. Transformers outperform previous deep
models such as RNNs and LSTMs on multiple NLP tasks [53]. A
Transformer consists of two main components, an encoder, and
a decoder. GPT-2 introduced by OpenAI 2, is a large generative
Transformer-based LM trained on a dataset of 8M web pages [39].

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

GPT-2 has been successfully exploited for various NLP and source
code analysis tasks [10, 16, 28, 49].

2.2 Multi-Task Learning
Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a model training technique that com-
bines multiple tasks and a joint loss function, with the goal of
maximizing performance on one or all of the tasks. MTL enables
knowledge transfer across related tasks and improves generaliza-
tion by leveraging the domain-specific information contained in the
training signals of related tasks [11]. An MTL model captures the
common features among all the tasks through sharing hidden layers
among them. MTL has been applied successfully in both NLP [13]
and source code analysis [32, 33]. There are two approaches to
jointly train models using MTL, hard-parameter and soft-parameter
sharing. In the former, the hidden layers are shared between all
tasks while keeping several task-specific output layers. For the
latter, each task has its own model with its own parameters. How-
ever, the distance between them is regularized to encourage the
parameters to be similar. In the soft-parameter sharing case, train-
ing can happen either sequentially (one task per training round) or
alternatively (one task per epoch).

2.3 Related Work
Autocompletion is an active research area for both practitioners
and researchers. Below, we review the latest approaches to auto-
completion.

2.3.1 Conventional Autocompletion. Traditionally, autocompleters
used heuristic rules static type information [20], similar code exam-
ples [9], and program history data [42] for suggesting completions.
For instance, IDEs conventionally return a list of type-checked
names either based on the order of alphabet or usage frequency.

Statistical LMs and Grammar-based Models. Several studies
2.3.2
use statistical LMs for modeling source code [17, 19, 37, 52]. Tu
et al. [52] built upon an n-gram model using a cache mechanism
to capture locality in source code. Hellendoorn and Devanbu [17]
improved the n-gram model by exploiting various techniques in-
cluding nested scopes, locality, and unlimited vocabulary. Raychev
et al. [40] proposed a probabilistic model based on decision trees
and domain-specific grammars. Researchers also studied the use
of syntactic structure through exploiting probabilistic graphical
models. Allamanis et al. [4] employ probabilistic context-free gram-
mars, while Raychev et al. [8, 40, 41] use probabilistic higher order
grammars to this end.

2.3.3 Deep Learning for Autocompletion. Recently, deep neural
networks such as RNNs, LSTMs and Transformers are being effec-
tively used for modeling source code [6, 17, 24, 25, 29]. In 2018, Li
et al. [29] proposed a pointer mixture model to mitigate the Out-
Of-Vocabulary (OOV) problem. They trained two LSTM models on
types and tokens. Karampatsis et al. [24] presented a large-scale
open-vocabulary neural LM. They incorporated BPE, beam search,
and cache mechanism to address the OOV problem. Most recently,
Kim et al. [25], incorporated the syntactic structure of trees into
their Transformer-based model to better learn from source code.

2.3.4 Multi-token Autocompletion. Although most research on
code completion is focused on single-token prediction, several stud-
ies aimed to complete entire statements or blocks of code [36, 49, 54,
55]. Yang et al. [55] proposed PCC and introduced an intermediate
representation for source code, to put tokens into groups using
lexeme and variable relative order. Nguyen et al. [36] proposed
AUTOSC to combine program analysis and software naturalness
and fill in a partially completed statement with frequent and valid
recommendations. Svyatkovskiy et al. [49] recently proposed a
GPT-2 based multi-lingual model, GPT-C, for completing lines. Wen
et al. [54] introduced FeaRS which recommends the next method
given the current code in an IDE using implementation patterns
learned through mining open source projects.

2.3.5 MTL for Autocompletion. MTL has been used in various NLP-
related tasks [45, 48, 56]. Recently, it has also been employed for
programming language processing tasks. Liu et al. [32, 33] proposed
two approaches based on MTL for autocompletion. In the first study,
the authors used a Transformer-XL and an RNN for predicting next
token type and value [32]. They develop a partial AST encoder
and a path2root encoder and use them in their MTL framework. In
their second study, Liu et al. [33] pre-train their model with hybrid
objective functions for code understanding and code generation
tasks. Next, they fine-tune it on code completion. The pre-training
tasks are masked bidirectional LM, next code segment prediction,
and unidirectional LM. The fine-tuning tasks are unidirectional
masked LM, and unidirectional LM.

2.3.6 Practical Aspects of Autocompletion. Hellendoorn et al. [18]
claim the accuracy of autocompleters evaluated on synthetic data
can drop on real-world data. Aye et al. [7], trained models on real-
world code completion examples of an internal dataset (Facebook).
They showed that models trained on data distributions that are
closer to those of where the model will be deployed can outper-
form models trained on committed source code in public reposi-
tories. Svyatkovskiy et al. [51] integrated Pythia, an LSTM model,
to IntelliCode, an extension to Microsoft VS Code IDE. In a follow-
up study [49], they introduced IntelliCode Compose as a general-
purpose multilingual autocompletion using Transformers. The im-
proved model predicts sequences of code tokens, generating up to
entire statements. IntelliCode Compose is integrated into the Mi-
crosoft VS Code IDE. Finally, Svyatkovskoy et al. [50] implemented
and evaluated several neural code completion models, which offer
varying trade-offs in terms of memory, speed, and accuracy. Com-
mercial autocompletion tools, such as TabNine and GitHub Copilot
also exist, but very little technical information has been shared
about them.

2.4 Baselines
We include six recent models as baselines to provide a comprehen-
sive evaluation. For all baselines, we use the replication packages
provided by the authors and set the parameters as defined in each
respective study. For the statement level prediction task, we modi-
fied the output layer of the baselines to predict up until the end of
a statement.

N-gram + LSTM (FSE, 2017): Hellendoorn et al. [17] claim that
a well-engineered and simple approach (n-gram based language

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

Izadi, et al.

models) can provide better performance than more complex models
(deep neural networks). The authors show that the combination
of an n-gram and LSTM-based model outperforms the rest of their
models.

Pointer Mixture (IJCAI, 2018): Li et al. [29], propose a pointer
mixture model to address the OOV problem. They also try to in-
corporate structural information in their models by training two
models (token types and values) separately.

T-XL + Bi-LSTM (ICPC, 2020): Liu et al. [32, 33], propose
two models based on the MTL technique. The first study uses
Transformer-XL and a Bi-LSTM to train two models for tokens
and AST paths for dynamically-typed languages such as Python.
The second study by the same group presents a pre-trained lan-
guage model which is fine-tuned for code completion. The authors
use static analysis and type annotations for their type prediction
task, for Java. We compare against the first model only, as it most
closely matches our setup.

OpenVocab (ICSE, 2020): To address the OOV problem, Karam-
patsis et al. [24] present a BPE-based language model. We include
it here for completeness, even though their model is not tuned for
autocompletion.

IntelliCode Compose (FSE, 2020): Svyatkovskiy et al. [49]
propose a general-purpose, multi-lingual autocompletion support-
ing multi-token statement completion. They train a GPT-2 model
on 1.2𝐵 LOC written in Python, C#, TypeScript, and JavaScript. This
tool is deployed as a cloud-based web service and uses client-side
caching and parallel implementation to speed up the predictions.
As the source code is not publicly available, we trained a GPT-2
model for source code and did our best to adhere to the settings
reported in the study. As the focus of our study is mono-lingual,
we only train this model on Python code.

TravTrans+ (ICSE, 2021): Kim et al. [25] propose a transformer-
based approach which exploits AST paths. We use their best model,
TravTrans+, as the state of the art in our evaluation.

3 APPROACH
The CodeFill pipeline comprises two main phases; pre-processing,
model training. Figure 1 presents the overall workflow. Initially,
CodeFill pre-processes, tokenizes and converts the input source
code to equivalent syntax token sequences. Training consists of
two main phases pre-training with 3 tasks (token sequence type
and name completion, statement completion) and fine-tuning on 2
tasks (name and statement completion). For both stages, CodeFill
uses soft-parameter sharing MTL to learn from different represen-
tations of source code. At evaluation time, Codefill also re-orders
recommendations based on their type and the visible context.

In the following section, we present how the proposed approach

works in detail.

3.1 Pre-processing
During pre-processing, CodeFill converts the input program files to
an equivalent format where keywords and identifiers are swapped
with their AST equivalents. The algorithm starts by removing com-
ment sections, blank spaces, and blank lines. It then extracts the list
of modules, libraries, and their aliases using the Python AST library.
Those are stored in a dictionary and, using it, CodeFill replaces all

Figure 2: Sample code snippet and the extracted information

their occurrences in code with their respective types (i.e., MODULE,
LIBRARY, and ALIAS).

CodeFill also pre-processes and tokenizes the input source code.
For each line, it reads the tokenized information and stores four
types of information about each token namely (1) its value, (2) its
type, (3) its line number, and (4) its position in the line. For instance,
for the statement return node in Figure 2, it stores two tokens as
shown in the table following the code example. Moreover, variable
visibility information (e.g., global vs. local variables), is maintained,
to differentiate between different name usages in the same context.

To address the OOV problem, CodeFill uses a BPE-encoded
name representation. Exploiting word segmentation, BPE itera-
tively merges the most frequently occurring character sequences.
Prior to applying BPE encoding, and similarly to other studies [21,
22, 49], CodeFill normalizes the input strings by replacing string,
and numeric literals with respective special tokens, i.e., STRING and
NUMBER.

A unique characteristic of the Python language is that indenta-
tion defines code blocks; it is therefore important for source code
models to learn to encode indentation as part of their learned rep-
resentation. To do so, CodeFill stores the positioning of indentation
markers. For the first line with an indentation, it adds a special to-
ken ⟨𝐼 𝑁 𝐷𝐸𝑁𝑇 ⟩ at the beginning of the given line. It passes through
the following lines with the same indentation, to reach the next
indentation or a dedentation position, at which point it adds a
respective ⟨𝐼 𝑁 𝐷𝐸𝑁𝑇 ⟩ or ⟨𝐷𝐸𝐷𝐸𝑁𝑇 ⟩ token.

The pre-processing step results in two files for each input source
code file; (1) one containing sequences of token names minus the
comments and extra blank lines, and (2) one containing sequences
of token types. Both are fed into CodeFill as two different but
corresponding representations of source code. Figure 3 shows a

3.2 Model Training
In this phase, CodeFill learns from two granularity levels; token-
and statement-level completions with three simultaneous tasks,
namely (1) next Token Value Prediction (TVP), (2) next Token Type
Prediction (TTP), and (3) Statement Completion (SC). Model train-
ing follows a two-stage process; First, a generic language modeling
objective is used on the unlabeled data to learn the initial parame-
ters. Then, these parameters are adapted to the target tasks using
the corresponding objective. Thus, while pre-training, CodeFill
learns from all three tasks while fine-tuning is restricted to the
TVP and SC tasks. The reason for excluding the TTP task is that
the number of types for all the program files is limited. Hence, the
model quickly learns how to properly predict these type sequences
(i.e., learns an effective representation of the Python grammar),
eliminating the need for further fine-tuning.

The main neural network architecture for all tasks is based on
the GPT-2 Transformer with 𝐿 layers. CodeFill uses three distinct
GPT-2 transformers, each with its own input and training objec-
tive. The models are initialized with random weights. Transformer
blocks include self-attention layer, feed-forward neural nets, and
a normalization layer. Self-attention blocks identify which tokens
to focus on. Feed-forward neural nets consist of an input layer to
accept information, hidden layers to capture the hidden correlations
between each data point, and finally, an output layer to transmit
information. The parameters are transferred to the next decoder in
the stack after being regularised (with 𝑙2 norm) to be similar to the
respective decoder’s parameters. CodeFill uses softmax activation
function in the output layer to generate probability distributions
over the vocabulary.

To train the model to predict a sequence of tokens, {𝑣𝑡 } ⊂ 𝐷, 𝑡 ∈
[1, . . . , 𝑁 ], with 𝐷 as the vocabulary, and 𝐶 as the existing code
context, CodeFill estimates the following conditional probability

distribution, 𝑃:

𝑃 (𝑣0, . . . , 𝑣𝑁 |𝑐0, . . . , 𝑐𝑇 ) =

𝑁
(cid:214)

𝑖=1

𝑃 (𝑣𝑖 |𝑐0, . . . , 𝑐𝑇 , 𝑣0, . . . , 𝑣𝑖−1).

(1)

We use a standard language modeling objective, predicting the
next token given a context, and maximize the following likelihood
based on our unsupervised corpus of tokens. In Equation 2, 𝑚 is
the length of the predicted sequence of code token values and 𝜃 is
the set of parameters that is learned through stochastic gradient
descent optimization to model 𝑃 [44].

𝐿(𝑉 ) =

∑︁

𝑖

log 𝑃 (𝑣𝑖 |𝑐0, ..., 𝑐𝑇 , 𝑣𝑖−𝑚, ..., 𝑣𝑖−1; 𝜃 ).

(2)

In each layer, multi-attention heads are used to aggregate the out-
put of the previous layer for each transformer block. Multi-headed
self-attention is applied over the input context tokens followed by
position-wise feed-forward layers to produce the output distribu-
tion.

(3)

(4)

(5)

where 𝐶 is the context vector of tokens, 𝐿 is the number of layers,𝑊𝑒
is the token embedding matrix, and 𝑊𝑝 is the position embedding
matrix.

For training with MTL, CodeFill uses the alternative training
strategy, which aims to prevent catastrophic forgetting (as opposed
to the sequential strategy). With a probability of 20%, 40%, and
40% for each of the TTP, TVP, and SC tasks, respectively, CodeFill
picks a random task for each epoch. TTP requires fewer epochs as
its vocabulary is fairly limited. Further on, for TVP and SC tasks,
CodeFill uses beam search to identify the most likely (sub-)token
sequences.

Loss is shared among all tasks. During pre-training, the param-
eters are tuned to minimize the absolute minimum of the cross
entropy losses among the three pre-training tasks, namely, TVP,

3.2.1 Token Value Prediction Task (TVP). CodeFill uses different
representations of programs for each task within the soft-parameter
sharing MTL framework. CodeFill treats the TVP task as masked
unidirectional prediction; left-side context is used to predict the
next token. The inputs to the task are sequences of token values,
represented as real-valued vectors of [𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑛].

3.2.2 Token Type Prediction Task (TTP). Similarly to TVP, TTP
is also treated as left-to-right masked unidirectional prediction.
The input are corresponding token type representations as real-
valued vector of [𝑡1, 𝑡2, . . . , 𝑡𝑛] As both the TTP and TVP models
are trained jointly, CodeFill is capable of exploiting token types
when the ultimate goal is to predicting token values.

Figure 4: Model training

Statement Completion Task (SC). As useful as next-token
3.2.3
prediction may be, developers can also benefit from getting longer
suggestions to complete code statements [6, 36, 49]. Correspond-
ingly, CodeFill can also benefit from training to predict longer
sequences, as training will enable it to better prioritize context use.
Thus, we add a third task to train CodeFill to provide completion
suggestions up and until the end of a statement. To predict a whole
statement given the existing code context 𝐶, and the vocabulary
𝐷, CodeFill attempts to generate token values {𝑣𝑡 } ⊂ 𝐷, condi-
tioned on the sequence of preceding token values {𝑐𝑡 } ⊂ 𝐷, For
this task, the pre-processing steps introduce a special token (⟨𝐸𝑂𝑆⟩)
to demarcate the end of a statement. CodeFill is trained to keep
predicting sequences of token names until it produces an ⟨𝐸𝑂𝑆⟩
token.

3.2.4 Beam search. CodeFill uses greedy (beam) search to identify
the most probable sequences given a sequence of probabilistic pre-
dictions. Specifically, |𝐵| (width of the beam) top probabilities, are
recorded partially for every step. This heuristic algorithm does not
necessarily optimize results; however, its computational complexity
equals to 𝑂 (|𝐵| × |𝑉 |) which is much faster than computing all cases.
As |𝐵| increases, the quality of generated summaries improves, how-
ever, the learning time increases as well. We experimented with
several beam values (3, 5, and 10), and settled to 5, as it provided a
good balance of accuracy and speed.

3.3 Post-processing

Re-ranking Recommendations. For a recommendation system to
be useful, predictions should be ranked similarly to user expec-
tations. To optimize ranking, CodeFill includes a post-processing

layer to re-rank the leaf nodes in the final recommendation list
based on the visible scope (i.e., the current file). This is based on
the observation that most completions should be local to the edited
file, as naming visibility rules should force names to cluster.

To re-rank the suggestions, CodeFill hierarchically divides the
visible scope to file, class, and closest function. The intuition here
is, when the model is predicting the next token and its type is ex-
pected to be a variable name, candidates in the closest scope have a
higher probability of being correct. However, when the next token
is predicted to be a function name, candidates from the same class
(functions defined in the same class) should be probably at the top
of the list. The re-ranking process consists of multiplying the pre-
diction probabilities of the top-10 predictions with a corresponding
weight coefficient. The weights are selected based on the type of
the predicted token and the scope of the declaration of the identi-
fier. Each prediction consists of a <token, type, probability>
triplet with respect to the prediction point that it is made available,
We generate the list of all visible names and their hierarchical scope
(function, class, file). Each prediction is then cross-checked with
this list, in the case where the predicted identifier is indeed already
declared in the file (and thus in the list), its prediction probability is
multiplied by a weight depending on the type of the predicted token
and the scope associated with the item in the list. As the weights
impact the quality of predictions, we first defined a range/ratio
for different categories based on our programming intuition. Then,
we experimented with this range and selected the best performing
weights. Table 1 presents the weights used in this process.

4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
To train and evaluate CodeFill, we use two Python datasets. We eval-
uate the models based on different evaluation scenarios, to achieve
a more realistic and comprehensive outlook on the performance of
code completion models to benefit developers in real-world cases.

4.1 Evaluation Tasks
We evaluate CodeFill on two tasks, namely Token-Level and Statement-
Level Predictions (TLP and SLP).

4.1.1 Token-Level Prediction. We use TLP to assess the ability of
the model to predict a single next token. We split this part of the
evaluation into four subtasks presented below.

Any token prediction. Our first sub-task is to evaluate the pre-
dictions of any token irrespective of its type (TLP-A). This is the
baseline evaluation task employed in the literature, but as research
has shown [18], it is not representative of real-world autocomple-
tion use. For this reason, we resort to more detailed evaluations, as
presented below.

Token Type Prediction. To assess the model’s ability to learn
grammatical sequences, we evaluate how well a model can predict a
correct AST token given a context (TLP-B). We group together AST
tokens in the following categories: Identifiers, Keywords, Operators,
Punctuation, and finally numerals and string Literals.

Figure 5: Length of statements in the PY117K dataset

Leaf Node Prediction. Inspired by the evaluation setup of the
state-of-the-art study by Kim et al. [25], we investigate the ability of
models when predicting AST leaf nodes (TLP-C), including Attribute
access, Names, Function parameters, and Constants.

Cardinal Point Prediction. The three tasks presented up to now
give a comprehensive view of the prediction ability of a model.
However, in practical settings, autocompletion is only triggered
at specific points (e.g., after a dot, or after specific keywords such
as for) while the developer is editing source code. To ensure that
predictions translate to practical benefits for the developers, we
evaluate completions on cardinal points (TLP-D). To obtain a list
of keywords after which autocompletion is likely to be triggered,
we first select the list of punctuation and keywords tokens that can
be completed. We then compute the frequency of all bi-grams with
any of these tokens as their first token in our dataset. Then, we
remove three sets of bi-grams; (1) those that are mostly written
together with occurrence frequency above 95% (e.g., async def),
(2) those that are normally not predictable (e.g., class NAME or def
FUNCTION-NAME), and finally (3) those that are usually not practical
completions (e.g., TRUE :). The resulting list of tokens after which
it is most beneficial for autocompletion to be triggered is as follows.

DOT, AWAIT, ASSERT, RAISE, DEL, LAMBDA, YIELD, RETURN,
EXCEPT, WHILE, FOR, IF, ELIF, ELSE, GLOBAL, IN, AND, NOT,
OR, IS, BINOP, WITH, ;, „ [, (, {, ~

Evaluation Metrics. As the model only predicts a single token
in the TLP task, we include two evaluation metrics, namely the
Accuracy of the top prediction and the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
for the top-10 recommendations.

Accuracy measures the proportion of samples for which the
suggested completion token exactly matches the single target label.
MRR assesses the whole top 𝑁 recommended completions and
takes into account the first position the target is matched [38]. For a
single query, the reciprocal rank is
where 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 is the position
of the highest-ranked answer (1, 2, 3, ..., 𝑁 for 𝑁 answers). If no
correct answer exists in top-𝑁 , then the reciprocal rank is 0. For
multiple queries 𝑄, the MRR is the mean of the 𝑄 reciprocal ranks.

𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘

Statement Level Prediction (SLP). The SLP task assesses a
4.1.2
model’s ability to complete statements with up to 𝑛 tokens. The
boxplot in Figure 5 shows the distribution of number of tokens for
completions in the evaluation dataset (𝑃𝑌 117𝐾). In our datasets,
statements are 4.2 tokens long on average (median: 4, maximum:
13). To provide a comprehensive view, we evaluate the performance
of the models when predicting next-𝑛 tokens with 𝑛 ∈ [2, 3, . . . , 8].

Evaluation Metrics: On absence of code-specific metrics, we use
two metrics commonly-used for automatic evaluation of text gen-
eration, namely Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit

ORdering (METEOR) [27] and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gist-
ing Evaluation (ROUGE-L) [30].

ROUGE: ROUGE-N refers to overlapping n-grams. ROUGE-L,
one of the variations of the ROUGE metric, counts longest match-
ing sequence of words using the Longest Common Subsequence
algorithm. It considers sentence-level structure similarity and auto-
matically identifies the longest co-occurring chain of in sequence
n-grams. Thus, it does not require consecutive matches but in-
sequence matches that reflect sentence-level word order.

METEOR is based on the term-to-term mapping of the gener-
ated code with its corresponding reference code. It focuses mainly
on recall. Lavie et al. [27] showed metrics based on recall consis-
tently achieve higher correlation with user preferences than those
based on precision alone.

4.2 Datasets
We use two Python datasets for training and evaluation:

• The ETH 150K Python dataset [40] for compatibility with
previous work. The authors collected Python programs from
GitHub repositories and removed duplicate files, project
forks, files that do not parse and have more than 30K nodes
in their ASTs. They also removed obfuscated files and only
used repositories with permissive licenses including MIT,
BSD, and Apache.

• The CodeFill dataset, which was collected by querying GHTor-
rent [15] for all non-forked Python repositories with more
than 20 stars (58k repositories).

After deduplication, using the method proposed by Allamanis [2],
we ended up with two versions of the original datasets, 𝑃𝑌 117𝐾
and 𝑃𝑌 1690𝐾 for the ETH and CodeFill datasets, respectively. Note
that 𝑃𝑌 1690𝐾 and 𝑃𝑌 117𝐾 do not have any common files. Table 2
presents an overview of the contents of the datasets.

We use 𝑃𝑌 1690𝐾 exclusively for pre-training our LM. We then
use 90% of 𝑃𝑌 117𝐾 for fine-tuning the model on the tasks presented
in Section 4.1, and finally the last 10% of 𝑃𝑌 117𝐾 for evaluation. For
the baselines, we concatenate 𝑃𝑌 1690𝐾 with the same 90% portion
of 𝑃𝑌 117𝐾 as above for training, and evaluate on the remaining
10% of 𝑃𝑌 117𝐾.

4.3 Implementation and Configuration
We use Python’s AST 3, Tokenize 4, and the DIS 5 libraries in our
6 library for the
conversion tool. Moreover, we use the HuggingFace
implementation of our GPT-2 and MTL models. We set the learning
rate to 0.00001, maximum sequence length to 2048, and trained our
model for 100 epochs. We set the remaining parameters to default
values. Our experiments are conducted on a machine equipped with
two GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPUs, an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690
v4 @ 2.60GHz CPU with 14 core processors, and 128G RAM.

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we present the results for each evaluation task,
along with an ablation study and a characterization of the models’
performance.

5.1 Token-level Prediction (TLP)
5.1.1 Any token prediction. The most basic form of evaluation for
an autocompletion model is to gauge its ability to predict the next
token given some context as input. TLP-A can provide an overview
on the ability of an autocompleter to predict, however, it does not
account for the prior probabilities of different types of tokens. We
present this task for compatibility with existing work, and further
elaborate CodeFill’s performance in the following tasks. The results
can be seen in Table 3; our model outperforms all the baselines
across all metrics.

5.1.2 Token Type Prediction. We investigate the performance of
the models when predicting different types of tokens, i.e., their
ability to assimilate how developers use grammar to express con-
cepts. Models generally struggle more with specific token types.
For instance, it is known that predicting identifiers is harder than
predicting keywords [18]. Table 4 present the Accuracy and MRR
results based on all token types. As demonstrated, CodeFill out-
performs the baselines for all token types based on both metrics
(except for MRR on keywords and punctuation, where its perfor-
mance is on par). Transformer-based approaches are highly capable
of predicting specific types of tokens, namely keywords and punctu-
ation; effectively, this means that given enough training examples,
they can efficiently learn syntactical patterns. Predicting identifiers
and literals across all models is more challenging. For identifiers,

all models’ result range from 37% to 56% accuracy. In both cases,
CodeFill maintains a non-trivial edge over the baselines, which
we attribute to the statement completion task. We believe it helps
CodeFill to learn syntactical patterns over longer ranges.

Leaf Node Prediction. We compare each model’s performance
5.1.3
in predicting different types of leaf nodes in an AST, e.g., function
calls, variables, and attribute names. Tables 5 present the Accuracy
and MRR results for this task. CodeFill is the best model in both ac-
curacy, and, especially, MRR. This means that its name predictions,
which is arguably the most important feature for an autocompleter,
are 2 out of 3 times correct and have a high probability (> 70%) of
being included in the top suggestions.

5.1.4 Cardinal Point Completion. In Table 6, we report the perfor-
mance of models when predicting at cardinal points (described in
Section 4.1). As indicated, CodeFill outperforms all the baselines.
Consequently, it is more capable of presenting correct recommenda-
tions at points where autocompletion is more likely to be triggered.

5.2 Statement-Level Prediction (SLP)
We report the results for autocompleting code statements, by pre-
dicting the remaining 𝑛 tokens at a given statement position (with
𝑛 ranging between 2 and 8). Figure 6 presents the results of this
experiment based on the achieved METEOR and ROUGE-L scores.
All Transformer-based models [25, 32, 49], are consistently more
capable than the three baseline approaches. CodeFill improves over
all competitors. The margin grows wider as the number of tokens re-
quired to complete statements increase (especially in the ROUGE-L
case). This result highlights the merits of our statement completion
task. In turn, this can help developers code faster by reducing the
number of required keystrokes; the experience of using statement
completion should be reminiscent of text line completion in popular

5.3 Ablation Study
We perform an ablation study to examine the impact of different
components of CodeFill . Table 7 presents the results of this study.
We include the performance of a vanilla GPT-2 model to show
the importance of employing the MTL approach to jointly train
models on different representations of source code. The results show
that employing the MTL technique to train the models jointly on
multiple tasks indeed helps the model learn better. Next, we conduct
experiments to compare hard-parameter and soft-parameter models
with the two-task MTL model. It is worth mentioning that for
the hard-parameter sharing variation, we need to input a unified
representation to the models. Thus, we concatenate the type and
value of each token as 𝑥𝑖 = [𝑡𝑖, 𝑣𝑖 ] and then feed the vectors of this
concatenated representation to the MTL model. The results indicate
that the soft-parameter sharing works better in our case. This is
probably because this setting allows each task to have its own model
and parameters and then regularizes the distance between them to

encourage the parameters to be similar. Finally, to verify whether
adding information regarding statements helps, we investigate the
effect of adding the third task, statement completion. The results
demonstrate that training on two different granularity (single-token
and statement) also helps them learn better. To conclude, each
component of the proposed model adds to its value. Although the
training time increases, it can be argued that training time is a one-
time cost, and can be significantly reduced with parallel training
on multiple GPUs.

5.4 Runtime Characteristics
An important aspect of ML-based autocompletion tools is their
prediction latency. A very accurate model that takes 1 second per
prediction will not be very useful in practice as it will interfere
with the developer’s workflow. As Table 8, all models feature an
average latency of less than 100 milliseconds, which is considered
the golden standard in the industry.

Moreover, the model size and number of parameters are impor-
tant practical aspects that affect a model’s deployment; if the model
is too big, it will need to be deployed centrally and clients should
connect to the model server over a network connection (which may
affect latency negatively), otherwise, it could be distributed to the
clients. As Table 8 shows, CodeFill’s number of parameters is more

than other baselines due to our architecture specification. However,
the size of all Transformer-based models makes them impractical
for distribution to clients, necessitating centralized deployments.

6 CONTRIBUTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
Autocompletion is a popular research area, however, the existing
challenges leave substantial margin for improvement, particularly
for recommending identifiers or completing longer sequences [18].
In this study, CodeFill learns from sequences of both token types
and token names simultaneously using MTL. The contribution of
this work is twofold;

Technical novelty: Similar to the state-of-the-art [25, 49], we
use transformers for learning a name-based sequencing model,
and similar to the studies by Liu et al. [32, 33], we use the MTL
technique to condition our models under different tasks. However,
IntelliCodeCompose [49] treats code as natural text, neglecting the
rich structure inherent in programs. Moreover they focus on multi-
lingual LMs. TravTrans+ [25] uses serialized ASTs in an attempt
to learn from structure, however, we show that our novel transfor-
mation, which we designed so that it is closer to how developers

treat source code structure, outperforms TravTrans+. CodeFill also
learns from our novel statement completion task to consider longer
contexts. Both Figure 6 and Table 7 show that this technique im-
proves the model, probably by helping it better utilize completion
context. The combination of the above demonstrably results in
higher evaluation scores and better recommendations.

Evaluation: We propose two novel evaluation tasks, cardinal
point, and statement completion, to address deficiencies in current
autocompletion evaluation setups. We also collect, pre-process,
deduplicate, and share an large Python dataset, consisting of prac-
tically all Python code on GitHub.

7 THREATS TO THE VALIDITY
Threats to internal validity: These include the threats pertaining
to the parameters affecting the performance of the model. Another
threat in this section relates to the errors in the implementation
of the baselines. For all of these approaches, we have used the
replication packages provided by these studies.

Threats to external validity: These threats relate to the qual-
ity of the datasets we used and the generalizability of the results.
We used two Python datasets; PY117K is a benchmark dataset [40]
frequently used in the literature [24, 25, 29, 32]. PY1690K, our sec-
ond dataset, is ten times larger with approximately 1.7𝑀 program
files. More data can lead to more generalizable results. Furthermore,
as Allamanis. [2] suggests, we have de-duplicated both datasets to
avoid biasing the models. All of the programs in both datasets are
collected from open-source GitHub repositories. However, further
studies are needed to validate and generalize our findings to other
programming languages.

Threats to construct validity: These relate to the suitability
of the evaluation setting and metrics. In this work, we have tried
to incorporate diverse evaluation measures. For the TLP task, we
have used standard evaluation metrics, namely Accuracy and MRR
in the top-one and top-ten recommendations which are both fre-
quently used in the literature [24, 25, 29, 32]. Furthermore, we use
ROUGE-L and METEOR scores for evaluation in the SLP task as
used in previous studies on source sequence of code generation,
summarization, and translation [1, 49].

8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Unlike natural language text, source code is more structured, its
grammar is more well defined but its vocabulary is orders of mag-
nitude bigger. Consequently, NLP-based models and corresponding
evaluation methods need to be adapted to the particular case of
source code.

In this work, we proposed CodeFill, a Transformer-based gen-
erative LM for source code pre-trained on three tasks closely rele-
vant to programming. Given a context of tokens (and their types),
CodeFill is trained to predict (1) the type of the next token, (2) its
value, and (3) the values of up to 𝑛 next tokens. We employ the
MTL approach to jointly train CodeFill on the above tasks. We also
propose 2 novel evaluation tasks, cardinal point prediction and
statement-level multi-token prediction, which we argue that they
better represent how autocompletion systems are used in practice.
We extensively evaluate CodeFill against six baselines on both tasks.
Our results indicate that CodeFill outperforms all the baselines in all

scenarios, achieving state of the art scores on both accuracy (80.6%)
and MRR (81.7%) in the basic token-level prediction task. Moreover,
we show that CodeFill also learns to autocomplete statements of up
to 4 tokens with over 70% accuracy, a significant improvement over
the baselines, making it practical to offer statement completions as
an IDE feature.

In the future, we plan to incorporate more domain specific knowl-
edge on aspects of training and evaluating a training ML models.
For instance, one can limit the context fed to the model based on the
programming language to better incorporate related information
of functions and nested scopes in a piece of code. We also plan to
further investigate statement completion, including better metrics
for its evaluation.
