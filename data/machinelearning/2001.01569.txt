Abstract 

In the present paper, an aerodynamic investigation of a high-speed train is performed. In the first 

section  of  this  article,  a  generic  high-speed  train  against  a  turbulent  flow  is  simulated, 

numerically. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations combined with the ùëò-ùúî 

SST  turbulence  model  are  applied  to  solve  incompressible  turbulent  flow  around  a  high-speed 

train.  Flow  structure,  velocity  and  pressure  contours  and  streamlines  at  some  typical  wind 

directions  of  Œ∏  =  0Àö,  30Àö,  45Àö  and  60,  are  the  most  important  results  of  this  simulation.  The 

maximum  and  minimum  values  are  specified  and  discussed.  Also,  the  pressure  coefficient  for 

some  critical  points  on  the  train  surface  is  evaluated.  In  the  following,  the  wind  direction 

influence  the  aerodynamic  key  parameters  as  drag,  lift,  and  side  forces  at  the  mentioned  wind 

directions are analyzed and compared. Moreover, the effects of velocity changes (50, 60, 70, 80 

and 90 m/s) are estimated and compared on the above flow and aerodynamic parameters. In the

second  section  of  the  paper,  various  data-driven  methods  including  Gene  Expression 

Programming (GEP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and random forest (RF), are applied 

for predicting output parameters. So, drag, lift and side forces and also minimum and maximum 

of pressure coefficients for mentioned wind directions (Œ∏ = 0¬∞ to Œ∏ = 60¬∞) and velocity (50 m/s to 

90 m/s) are predicted and compared using statistical parameters. Obtained results indicated that 

RF in all coefficients of wind direction and most coefficients of free stream velocity provided the 

most  accurate  predictions.  As  a  conclusion,  RF  may  be  recommended  for  the  prediction  of 

aerodynamic coefficients.

1.  Introduction 

The  research  on  the  flow  around  high-speed  trains  is  considered  a  popular  subject  among 

engineering  applications.  Many  countries  have  built  high-speed  train  lines  to  link  cities, 

including  Germany,  China,  Austria,  Belgium,  France,  Poland,  Italy,  Portugal,  Japan,  Russia, 

South  Korea,  Spain,  Sweden,  Taiwan,  Turkey,  United  Kingdom,  United  States  and  etc. 

Nowadays,  trains  move  at  high  speed,  study  of  the  aerodynamic  characteristics  of  the  air  flow 

around them is  an interesting topic. In recent  years, many simulations  of flow over high-speed 

trains  have  been  performed.  The  most  significand  and  related  of  them  reviewed  in  previous 

research of the authors (Rashidi, 2019) which are listed as follow: 

2 

 
 
 
A comparison between numerical and experimental simulation of air flow over a high-speed 

train  was  investigated  (Paradot,  2002).  A  SNCF  (French  high-speed  train)  with  high  Reynolds 

number (almost 109) was used for aerodynamic analysis. 

Effect  of  cross-wind  on  a  high-speed  train  was  investigated,  numerically  (Khier,  2002).  In 

this  paper,  the  flow  over  the  German  InterRegio  high-speed  train  were  simulated  using 

Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and k-Œµ turbulence model. 

Effects  of  crosswind  on  the  German  InterRegio  high-speed  train  was  estimated  (Fauchier, 

2002). For the numerical simulation, the RANS approach along with RNG  k-Œµ turbulent model 

was  implemented.  In  this  analysis,  at  first,  a  preliminary  study  has  been  done  on  a  simple 

geometry of train via CFD. Then, a three-dimensional model of the train in three following cases 

have been investigated. 

 A research of aerodynamic flow characteristics on a high speed train was done (Shin, 2003). 

In this numerical study, the variation of in the aerodynamic forces were performed for the high 

speed train at the entrance of a tunnel. 

A  numerically  investigation  of  the  fluid  flow  around  a  high-speed  train  was  done  (Tian, 

2009).  As  the  high  speed  at  modern  train  is  effective  in  aerodynamic  drag,  reducing  drag  and 

consequently reducing energy consumption is one of the main issues in the development of the 

rail industry. 

An aerodynamic characteristic of a Chinese high-speed train using RANS numerical method 

was performed (Zhao, 2009). In this research, the aerodynamic influences were studied with the 

train at the entrance and exit of a tunnel. 

An optimization of aerodynamic characteristics of high-speed train using numerical method 

was  investigated  (Krajnoviƒá,  2009).  By  RANS  numerical  method,  the  simple  polynomial 

3 

 
response  surfaces  instead  of  complex  NS  simulations  and  Genetic  Algorithm  (GA)  an 

optimization aerodynamic properties have been conducted on Swedish high-speed train X2000. 

A  simulation  of  a  high-speed  train  at  a  tunnel  entrance  was  presented  (Li,  2011).  For  this 

purpose, the RANS numerical method and k-Œµ turbulent model for a viscous compressible fluid 

was applied. 

A  numerical  simulation  of  EMU  high-speed  train  using  RANS  method  and  RNG  k-Œµ 

turbulent  model  was  conducted  (Wang,  2012).  The  main  reason  for  this  research  was  the 

pressure  changes  and  aerodynamic  forces  with  two  trains  passing  alongside  each  other  in  a 

tunnel. 

A  numerical  aerodynamic  characteristics  of  a  high-speed  train  against  a  crosswind  using 

unsteady three dimensional RANS approach and k-Œµ turbulent model was done (Asress, 2014). In 

the simulation, two scenarios for ground as static and moving for yaw angles ranges from 30Àö to 

60Àö were considered. 

A  numerical  simulation  about  wind  effect  on  a  high-speed  train  was  done  (Peng,  2014).  A 

three  dimensional  incompressible  RANS  method  and  k-Œµ  turbulent  model  has  been  done  For 

simulation of air flow passing a simple high-speed train. 

An  optimization  of  aerodynamic  parameters  for  high-speed  trains  was  investigated  useing 

numerical method (Shuanbao, 2014). The complicated wake flow deeply  affects the movement 

of the trains. 

An  aerodynamic  simulation  of  two  high-speed  trains  in  a  tunnel  using  RANS  numerical 

method  and  RNG  k‚ÄìŒµ  turbulence  model  (Chu,  2014).  In  this  paper,  a  three-dimensional, 

compressible, turbulence model was applied to find the pressure wave. 

4 

 
An aerodynamic analysis of a high-speed train via numerical method was performed (Zhang, 

2015). Effects of the slope angles and cut depth on the flow structure around the train were the 

most  important  goals  of  this  article  to  determine.  Also,  the  surface  pressure  and  aerodynamic 

forces  of  train  were  analyzed  using  RANS  approach  combined  with  the  eddy  viscosity 

hypothesis in turbulence model. 

A  comparison  between  Reynolds-averaged  Navier‚ÄìStokes  (RANS)  turbulence  models  and 

experimental wind tunnel findings by Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) for pressure on a high-

speed  train  was  conducted  (Morden,  2015).  The  k-Œµ,  k-Œµ  re-normalization  group  (RNG), 

realizable  k-Œµ,  Spalart‚ÄìAllmaras  (S-A)  and  shear  stress  transport  (SST  k-œâ)  are  the  five 

numerical models of RANS used in this article. 

An aerodynamic investigation on a simple model of high-speed train under crosswind using 

the  numerical  method  of  large  eddy  simulation  (LES)  was  performed  (Zhuang,  2015).  In  this 

study, the effects of flow diversion were investigated with two angles of œÜ = 30Àö and 60Àö using 

LES. 

A CFD simulation using RANS numerical method for a high-speed train against a crosswind 

for two conditions; stationary and moving was conducted (Catanzaro, 2016). The effect of each 

conditions was analyzed. 

An  aerodynamic  design  on  a  high-speed  train  was  done  (Ding,  2016).  Due  to  the  speed 

improvements of the high-speed trains and increasing the aerodynamic effect of the mechanical 

one, the effects and issues of aerodynamics were considered as the main challenge of this paper. 

An aerodynamic performance of a train under crosswinds condition using RANS numerical 

method was investigated (Liu, 2016). In this research, via the computational fluid dynamics, the 

aerodynamic characteristics was done for the train on a special slope and crosswind conditions. 

5 

 
An aerodynamic comparison between two trains, a static and a moving was done (Premoli, 

2016). In this research, using the numerical RANS method the simulation results of the relative 

movements  of  the  trains  between  the  vehicle  and  its  infrastructure  that  was  effective  on  the 

aerodynamic coefficients were compared. 

In the present study, the key flow parameters such as pressure, velocity and the aerodynamic 

parameters of a turbulent air flow around a generic high-speed train are analyzed. Moreover, the 

mentioned  parameters  are  predicted  by  the  data  driven  methods  of  GEP,  GPR  and  RF.  Then, 

using evaluation parameters, the most accurate model is suggested. 

2.  Computational Simulation

2.3. Mesh Description 

The used mesh in the computational domain for the different cases (wind directions of Œ∏ = 0Àö, 

30Àö,  45Àö  and  60Àö)  are  4,000,000  nodes,  approximately  and  the  y+  range  are  between  73.2  and 

94.3. For these cases, the y+ must be located between 30 to 300. In the following, two refinement 

boxes near and around the train for more accurate analysis are used (as Figure 5).

2.4. Boundary Conditions 

The defined boundary conditions of the case are as follows: 

Inlet: a uniform velocity, that represents the free stream velocity, U‚àû in the x direction.

Also, the Reynolds number, Re, according to the height of the train, H = 0.56 m, free stream 

velocity, U‚àû = 70 m/s, and kinematic viscosity, ŒΩ = 1.5 √ó 10-5, (Re = U‚àû√ó H/ ŒΩ) is 2.6 √ó 106. 

2.5. Solution Approach and Governing Equations 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
The  air  flow  field  around  the  high-speed  train  which  defined  as  a  3D  incompressible 

turbulent  flow  is  solved  by  the  Reynolds-Averaged  Navier-Stokes  (RANS)  equation  combined 

with  the  ùëò-ùúî  Shear-Stress  Transport  (SST)  turbulence  approach.  The  Reynolds-Averaged 

Navier-Stokes, is a time-average method of fluid flow description. In this method, instantaneous 

quantities are replaced by average and oscillating ones. 

According to  the selected solution method, The continuity and Navier-Stokes  equations for 

the incompressible air flow around the train as follows: 

where,  i,  j  and  k  =  1,  2  and  3  are  related  to  the  streamwise  ‚Äìx,  cross-stream  ‚Äìy  and  ‚Äìz 

direction, respectively. The velocity ingredients, 

 and the pressure, 

 are both nonlinear terms. 

Hence, there aren‚Äôt any analytical solves for the problem with optional boundary conditions. The 

transience  of  the  flow  parameters  (i.e.  velocity  and  pressure)  are  divided  into  mean  value  and 

fluctuations as follows: 

where 

 and 

 are  the  time-averaged,  while 

 and 

 are  the  fluctuation  terms  of  velocity 

and  pressure,  respectively.  Substituting  the  Reynolds  divided  velocities  and  pressures  into  the 

Continuity  and  Navier-Stokes  equations  yields  the  RANS  equation  of  motions  as  illustrated 

below:

According to the Boussinesq, the Reynolds-stress tensor could be connected to the mean rate 

of deformation. The concept applied for the turbulence model is as below: 

where, the turbulent kinetic energy (ùëò) and the specific dissipation rate (ùúî) are solved via the 

following equations: 

Turbulence Kinetic Energy, ùëò

3.  Aerodynamic Results and Discussions 

3.1. Flow Structure 

It  is  clear that the wind direction has significant influence on the flow structure around the 

generic high-speed train. In this section, the influence of free stream  direction at  four different 

angles of wind directions  of  Œ∏  = 0Àö, 30Àö, 45Àö and 60Àö perpendicular to  the x-axis  with  constant 

velocity magnitude is presented graphically in Figure 6. It should be noted that the obtained flow 

structure is predicted by SST transitional model as a time-averaged flow. 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Three-dimensional time-averaged flow structures for different wind direction angles. 

As it can be seen in Figure 10, the circulations at the lee-side of the generic train model were 

created.  These  circulations  at  each  section  along  the  length  of  model  are  consists  of  two  main 

circulations  which  are  kindled  form  roof-side  and  bottom-side  of  the  model.  Furthermore,  the 

length  and  width  of  the  circulations  changes  along  the  length  of  model.  It  is  obvious  in  the 

figures  that  the  nose  of  the  model  has  considerable  influence  on  the  three-dimensional  flow 

structure.  The  nose  of  model  causes  vortex  which  is  inclined  to  positive direction  of  x-axis.  It 

13 

 
 
should be noted that the circulation existing at the leeward of the model enhances the pressure 

coefficient and resulted drag force. 

In  order to  comprehensive investigation of the  flow structure, the flow pattern at  two most 

important  regions  were  investigated  for  windside  and  leeward.  The  leeward  flow  patterns  are 

identified by three-dimensional and two dimensional flow patterns. Since the three-dimensional 

flow structures at the windside will not render clear insight, the stream lines at the surface of the 

generic  train  model  are  obtained  in  Figure  7.  It  can  be  observed  that  the  positions  of  the 

stagnation  lines  at  the  surface  of  model‚Äôs  body  are  almost  similar  for  all  cases.  On  the  other 

hand, the stagnation lines at the model‚Äôs nose are deflected to roofward of the model. It is due to 

the  fact  that  the  air  flow  is  imposed  to  be  passed  form  roofward  due  to  limited  space  at  the 

bottom of the train model. Totally, the variation of wind direction has no pronounced influence 

on the flow pattern at the windside region. 

The two-dimensional total pressure contours over the train for different wind directions (Œ∏ = 

0Àö, 30Àö, 45Àö and 60Àö) are presented in Figure 8. The pressure distribution around the train are the 

same for the different  wind  directions, generally. The pressure  at  the front  and the back of the 

train has the maximum and minimum values, respectively.

Moreover, the two dimensional velocity distribution (x-axis velocity: U) around the train for 

different wind direction angles are illustrated in Figure 9. Based on principles, the velocity value 

close to the train body is lower and at the farther away is higher.

Also, Figure 10 shows the two dimensional pressure distribution along train cross section for 

different wind direction angles (Œ∏ = 0Àö, 30Àö, 45Àö and 60Àö). All cases illustrate the low region of 

pressure at the leeside of the train if compared to the windward side. 

3.2 Turbulent Characteristics 

18 

 
 
 
The  contours  of  two  different  turbulent  parameters  of  turbulent  kinetic  energy  (k)  and 

specific dissipation rate (œâ) for different wind direction angles are presented in Figures 11 and 

12, respectively. As the air stream collides with the generic train model, the regime of air flow 

stream changes form laminar to turbulent. The zones with turbulent regime and the intensity of 

turbulence may be identified with kinetic turbulent energy parameter. As shown as Figure 13, in 

case of Œ∏ = 0¬∞, the highest value of turbulent kinetic energy occurs at the adjacent of the nose of 

the model. Furthermore, the turbulent kinetic energy reduces level by level as the air flow getting 

away from the generic train model. It is due to the fact that the air flow speed becomes slower 

and the disordered flow structure changes to regular flow pattern. In addition, it is clear that the 

nose  of  the  model  has  pronounced  influence  on  determining  the  turbulent  region.  In  the  next 

cases  with  Œ∏  =  30¬∞,  45¬∞  and  60¬∞,  the  regions  with  different  turbulent  kinetic  energy  are  totally 

irregular as same as the three-dimensional flow structure at this case. It can be observed that the 

regions near to the train model have higher value of turbulent kinetic energy. 

The specific turbulence dissipation is the rate at which turbulence kinetic energy is converted 

into  thermal  internal  energy  per  unit  volume  and  time.  The  values  of  specific  turbulent 

dissipation  rate  for  the  cases  Œ∏  =  0¬∞,  30¬∞,  45¬∞  and  60¬∞  are  almost  similar  with  each  other.  The 

contours of specific dissipation rate reveal that the maximum value of this parameter occurs at 

the surface of the nose of the generic high-speed train model.

3.3.  Aerodynamic Forces 

The  most  significant  and  practical  aerodynamic  parameters  for  bluff  bodies  simulation  are 

lift, drag and side forces. To achieve this, the mentioned forces for train case for different wind 

directions  are  defined  and  estimated,  clearly.  The  lift  force  and  the  drag  force  coefficients  are 

defined as follows (Zhuang, 2015): 

21 

 
 
and 

where, 

 and 

 are the drag and lift forces, 

 and 

 are the surface area of the train in y- 

and z- directions, respectively. Moreover, the side force coefficient is defined as follows: 

where, 

 and 

 are  the  side  force  and  the  side  surface  area  of  the  train  in  x-  direction, 

respectively. Also, the pressure coefficient is as follow: 

where, 

, 

 and 

 are  the  free  stream  pressure,  density  and  free  stream  velocity, 

respectively. 

For verifying the extracted data from this paper, did an approximate comparison between the 

aerodynamic  coefficients  obtained  from  this  paper  and  the  (Zhuang,  2015).  The  geometric 

conditions of the two papers are as the same and for more accuracy the free stream velocity was 

considered U‚àû = 20 m/s, as the (Zhuang, 2015). The comparison results is illustrated as Table 1. 

The  comparison  show  that  the  a  good  agreement  between  the  results  of  this  paper  and  the 

obtained results from (Zhuang, 2015). 

In the following, for different wind directions of this research, i.e. 0Àö, 30Àö, 45Àö and 60Àö and for 

70 m/s free stream velocity, the lift, drag and side aerodynamic coefficients are compared which 

22 

 
 
 
 
 
are illustrated in Table 2. As can be seen from Table 2, when the wind directions increase, the 

lift,  drag  and  side  aerodynamic  coefficients  increase.  Then,  the  friction  and  resistance  against 

train  movement  increase  too.  Moreover,  in  Table  3,  the  time-averaged  of  the  minimum, 

maximum and average values of the pressure coefficients for mentioned different wind directions 

are listed and compared. As the same way, with increasing the wind direction of the free stream, 

the  numerical  values  of  the  minimum,  maximum  and  the  average  values  of  the  pressure 

coefficients increase too. Also, the maximum value of pressure coefficient at 60Àö wind direction 

has the highest value. 

Then, the exact pressure coefficient for different nodes on the train surface as Figure 13 are 

shown  in  Figure  14.  As  shown  in  Figure  14,  the  top  nodes  of  the  train  roof  which  are  the 

midpoints of the roof to pressure coefficients analysis and compare are considered. The desired 

values are listed in Figure 14 based on the marked points.

 In  this  part,  two  comparisons  on  some  aerodynamic  key  parameters  for  five  different  free 

stream velocity as 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 m/s (and consequently five different Reynolds numbers 

as 1.9√ó106, 2.2√ó106, 2.6√ó106, 3.0√ó106 and 3.4√ó106) are done.  

In  the  following,  for  the  different  free  stream  velocity,  the  lift,  drag  and  side  aerodynamic 

coefficients are compared which are illustrated in Table 4. As it can be seen from Table 4, when 

the wind velocity increases, the lift, drag and side aerodynamic coefficients increase. Then, the 

friction and resistance against train movement increase too. 

Moreover, in Table 5, the time-averaged of the minimum, maximum and average values of 

the  pressure  coefficients  for  the  different  wind  velocity  and  Reynolds  numbers  are  listed  and 

compared. According to the results, the maximum value of the pressure coefficient is related to 

the 90 m/s velocity. 

In the following, the aerodynamic drag coefficient for some points during the train length is 

illustrated  in  Figure  15  based  on  the  point  which  shown  in  Figure  13.  As  can  be  seen,  the

points  increase  too.  Also,  from  the  nose  to  the  end  of  the  train,  the  aerodynamic  drag  has  a 

downward trend. Moreover, The maximum value of the drag coefficient is related to the case of 

90 m/s and occurs at the nose of the train.

4.3.  Prediction Results and Discussion 

In  the  current  research,  the  coefficients  of  CD,  CL,  CS,  CP,min  and  CP,max  were  estimated  in 

both wind direction and free stream velocity cases using Gene Expression Programming (GEP), 

Gaussian  Process  Regression  (GPR)  and  random  forest  (RF)  methods.  It  should  be  noted  that 

there is no straightforward way of splitting training and testing data. For example, the study of 

(Kurup,  2014)  used  a  total  of  63%  of  their  data  for  model  development,  whereas  (S. 

Samadianfard,  Delirhasannia,  R.,  Kisi,  O.,  &  Agirre-Basurko,  E.,  2013)  and  (S.  Samadianfard, 

Sattari, M. T., Kisi, O., & Kazemi, H., 2014) used 67% of total data, and (Deo, 2018) used 70% 

of total data to develop their models. Thus, to develop the studied GEP, GPR and RF models for 

estimation  of  aerodynamic  coefficients,  we  divided  the  data  into  training  (70%)  and  testing 

(30%).  Additionally,  the  parameters  of  GEP  are  displayed  in  Table  7.  Hence,    the  obtained 

results of the statistical parameters for GEP, GPR and RF models in the test phase are given in

As it can be seen from Table 8, RF had the best performance in estimation of all aerodynamic 

coefficients in the case of wind direction. In other words, RF in the case of wind direction with 

CC values of 0.9982, 0.9988, 0.9990, 0.9994, 0.9993, RMSE values of 0.0235, 0.0169, 0.0469, 

0.0733,  0.0503  and  RAE  values  of  0.0635,  0.0493,  0.0457,  0.0336,  0.0347  presented  more 

accurate  estimations  of  CL,  CD,  CS,  CP,min,  CP,max,  respectively  comparing  to  GEP  and  GPR 

models.  So,  it  can  be  selected  as  the  best  among  studied  models  for  estimating  aerodynamic 

coefficients in the case of wind direction. Furthermore, somehow different trend was seen in the 

case of free stream velocity. In this case, GEP estimated CL, CP,max more accurately than GPR and 

RF  models.  In  other  words,  GEP  with  CC  values  of  0.9986,  0.9977,  RMSE  values  of  0.0048, 

0.0196 and RAE values of 0.0584, 0.0656 proved itself as the most precise and powerful model 

for CL, CP,max estimation and had more better performance in comparison to GPR and RF models. 

But  in  estimating  CD,  CS,  CP,min  coefficients,  RF  with  CC  values  of  0.9984,  0.9227,  0.9967, 

RMSE values of 0.0058, 0.0017, 0.0527 and RAE values of 0.0781, 0.3002, 0.0903 was selected 

as superior model as it was chosen the best in estimation of aerodynamic coefficients in the case 

of wind direction. 

Moreover, the statistical parameters of SVR, SVR-FOA, GEP and RF models are presented 

as  bar  chart  in  Figure  16.  It  is  clear  from  this  figure  that  SVR-FOA  has  higher  capability  in 

accurate  estimation  of SBAHC.  Moreover,  Figures 16 to  21 show the estimation results of the 

GEP,  GPR  and  FR  models  in  both  wind  direction  and  free  stream  velocity  cases.  It  can  be 

comprehended  from  these  figures  that  the  estimates  of  RF  are  in  better  agreement  than  other 

considered models. Furthermore, GEP may be selected as the second best.

Also,  the  variations  of  estimated  coefficients  are  illustrated  at  Figures  22  and  23. 

Additionally, Figures 24 and 25 indicate scatter plots of estimated coefficients versus observed 

ones in both wind direction and free stream velocity cases with GEP, GPR and RF models. It is 

obvious that due to less scattered points, the estimated values of RF are more accurate than GEP 

and GPR in most cases.

Despite the lower accuracy of GEP model in  the case of aerodynamic coefficients  of wind 

direction  and  estimating  CD,  CS,  CP,min  coefficients  in  the  case  of  free  stream  velocity,  the 

produced  mathematical  formulation  of  GEP  may  be  practical  for  the  estimation  of  these 

aerodynamic coefficients. So, the resulted GEP formulations are presented at Table 9.

Conclusion 

The basic objective of the present numerical investigation is to analyze the air flow around a 

high-speed train model. At the first section of the research, a generic high-speed train model is 

39 

velocitystreamfreeFSVdirectionwindWD:: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
utilized to predict the time-averaged three-dimensional flow structure, turbulence quantities and 

the aerodynamic forces (as lift, drag, side and pressure coefficients) at different wind direction Œ∏ 

= 0¬∞, 30¬∞, 45¬∞ and 60¬∞ and constant velocity magnitude of the free stream with  Re = 2.6 √ó 106. 

The Reynolds Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations  combined with the SST  ùëò-ùúî turbulence model 

are  applied  to  solve  incompressible  turbulent  air  flow  around  the  high-speed  train.  In  the 

following,  the  influences  of  velocity  (50,  60,  70,  80  and  90  m/s)  and  the  related  Reynolds 

number changes on the flow and aerodynamic key parameters are compared. Also, more detailed 

results are visible as: 

‚Ä¢  The flow direction angle has  pronounced influence on the three-dimensional  flow structure 

around the model.  

‚Ä¢  The pressure coefficient  enhances with increasing of wind direction angle. 

‚Ä¢  The  curvy  nose  of  the  generic  train  model  has  considerable  influences  on  determining  the 

vortex and its turbulent nature at leeward region. 

‚Ä¢  The distributions of the pressure coefficient are affected by wind direction angle. 

‚Ä¢  The pressure coefficient have higher magnitude near the nose of the model. 

At the second section of the article, GEP, GPR RF methods are used for prediction of the lift, 

drag and side forces and also minimum and maximum pressure coefficients for wind directions 

(for Œ∏ = 0Àö to 60Àö) and velocity (for 50 m/s to 90 m/s), generally. Due to this methods, the above 

parameters for all mentioned wind direction and velocity are predicted, simultaneously. Obtained 

results indicated that RF model performed the ayrodynamic parameters more precisely than GPR 

and GEP in  most cases.  In other words, RF provided the superior prredcitions of ayrodynamic 

parameters in all wind direction parameters and most of free stream velocity parameters. Hence, 

40 

 
RF  model  may  be  implemented  with  high  degree  of  accuracy  for  predicting  ayrodynamic 

parameters.
