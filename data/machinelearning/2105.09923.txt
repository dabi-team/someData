Direct searches for new particles at colliders have traditionally been factorized into model proposals
by theorists and model testing by experimentalists. With the recent advent of machine learning
methods that allow for the simultaneous unfolding of all observables in a given phase space region,
there is a new opportunity to blur these traditional boundaries by performing searches on unfolded
data. This could facilitate a research program where data are explored in their natural high
dimensionality with as little model bias as possible. We study how the information about physics
beyond the Standard Model is preserved by full phase space unfolding using an important physics
target at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC): exotic Higgs boson decays involving hadronic ﬁnal states.
We ﬁnd that if the signal cross section is high enough, information about the new physics is visible
in the unfolded data. We will show that in some cases, quantiﬁably all of the information about
the new physics is encoded in the unfolded data. Finally, we show that there are still many cases
when the unfolding does not work fully or precisely, such as when the signal cross section is small.
This study will serve as an important benchmark for enhancing unfolding methods for the LHC and
beyond.

INTRODUCTION

Analyses at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are gen-
erally classiﬁed as measurements or searches if their goal
is to search for indirect or direct signs of physics beyond

the Standard Model (SM), respectively. An important
reason for this distinction is that measurements assume
that deviations to the SM are small. This is required
so that the removal of detector distortions (‘unfolding’)
can be based on SM simulations. Traditional unfolding
methods [1–7] are based on low-dimensional and binned
observables. The detector response may depend on addi-
tional unmeasured features and may vary strongly within
a given bin. If these properties are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
for new particles, then an unfolding derived with SM
simulations is likely to be inaccurate.

This feature of current unfolding methods has been
studied in [8] and limits the applicability of recasting
tools such as Contur [9]. A variety of complementary
tools have been developed to fold model predictions with
a detector response, including MadAnalysis [10–14], Re-
cast [15–17], CheckMATE [18, 19], SModelS [20, 21],
Fastlim [22], and XQCAT [23]. In addition to limita-
tions from recasting approximations, these approaches
are limited by the minimal (binned) search results that
are usually highly optimized for particular signal models.
One possibility is to perform model-agnostic approaches
at detector-level using one of the growing number of
anomaly detection methods [24–65] (for reviews, see
Ref [60, 66]). These techniques can achieve broad and
deep sensitivity by learning directly from data. However,
methods that do not rely on any signal information (unsu-
pervised) are not particularly sensitive [47, 65] and meth-
ods that use noisy or partial signal information (weakly
and semisupervised, respectively) are not recastable after
the search is performed [44].

A new solution that has emerged is to perform an
unbinned unfolding using all of the available information.
If the high frequency and high dimensional aspects of the
detector response are part of the unfolding procedure, then

diﬀerences between signal and background will not be a
source of bias. Unbinned and high-dimensional unfolding
are now possible with advances in machine learning [67–
69] (for other machine learning and unbinned proposals,
see Ref. [70–74]). Of these, only the OmniFold [67] can
currently process the full phase space that includes all
observable particles and their properties. Unlike proposals
based on generative models, OmniFold is built on neural
network classiﬁers that are used to iteratively reweight
simulations to match the data. Classiﬁers designed to
process variable-length, unordered sets of particles allow
this technique to access the full phase space [75, 76].
While OmniFold has yet to be applied to collider data
in the full phase space, it has recently been deployed in a
low-dimensional case with the H1 experiment [77].

In this paper, we investigate the ability of OmniFold
to preserve information about new particles present in the
data. In particular, we will study the direct production
of new particles which have spectra that are not similar
to the SM background. Our benchmark example will be
the exotic decay of a Higgs boson-like particle decaying
into a Z boson and a light color singlet that decays into
hadrons. The dominant background to this process is
the SM production of Z bosons and jets. We will see
to what extent the information about new particles are
presevered in the unfolding. Recently, the authors of
Ref. [69] showed that generative model approaches can
preserve new physics with a relatively large cross section.
Our ﬁrst example will be motivated by this example
and then we will explore how the sensitivity depends
on variations in signal model parameters and unfolding
setup.

This paper is organized as follows. Section II brieﬂy
reviews full phase space unfolding and introduces the
beneﬁts and challenges of the existing approach in the
context of physics beyond the Standard Model. The simu-
lation samples and machine learning setup are introduced
in Sec. III. Section IV explores a case where a model-
independent new physics search technique, such as bump
hunting, could be applied in unfolded data. Section V
then studies an example of exotic Higgs boson decays,
where simple bump-hunting would be less fruitful. Impli-
cations of model-dependent search program in unfolded
data are explored in this section as well. The paper ends
with conclusions and outlook in Sec. VI.

II. REVIEW OF OMNIFOLD UNFOLDING

The OmniFold method is represented visually in Fig. 1.
There are two inputs: natural data from experiment and
synthetic data from simulation. The goal is to remove the
detector distortions from the observations (“Data”) to
infer the underlying particle-level distribution (“Truth”).
Synthetic particle-level events (“Generation”) provide
the initial guess for the Truth and we have an event-
by-event match between the Generation and detector-
level synthetic data (“Simulation”). As in all unfolding

FIG. 1. Visual representation of the OmniFold method. This
method relies on experimental “Data”, which was caused by
some underlying “Truth” distribution, and synthetic datasets
at both particle-level (“Generation”) and detector-level (“Sim-
ulation”). The Simulation is reweighted to match the Data
using a classifer, and these weights, ωi are applied to Genera-
tion. The unweighted Generation is reweighted to match the
Generation with ωi applied, giving particle-level weights, νi.
This process is repeated iteratively, as the νi are applied to
the Simulation, and this reweighted Simulation is once again
reweighted to Data. Based on the corresponding ﬁgure from
Ref. [67].

algorithms, we assume that the detector response is well-
modeled.

The ﬁrst step in the OmniFold method is to train
a classiﬁer to distinguish the Data from the Simulation.
An optimally trained classiﬁer that minimizes one of the
standard loss functions (cross entropy or mean squared
error) will predict the probability that an event xdet is
drawn from Data instead of Simulation: Pr(Data|xdet).
By applying the weight

ω1 =

Pr(Data|xdet)
1 − Pr(Data|xdet) ∝

p(xdet|Data)
p(xdet|Simulation)

to each simulated event, the Simulation will closely re-
semble the Data.

The detector-level weights, ω1 are then applied to
the corresponding particle-level events, resulting in a
reweighted distribution of particle-level events. A second
classiﬁcation step is required because these pulled back
weights are not a proper function of the particle-level
phase space: the same phase space point can be mapped
to two diﬀerent detector-level points with diﬀerent weights
under the stochastic mapping of the detector. The second
classiﬁer distinguishes the nominal Generation from the
one using the weights from the ﬁrst step. As with the

We will parameterize the classiﬁers as neural networks.
When x is the full phase space, i.e. a complete list of
reconstructed or true particles with their observable prop-
erties, we need a neural network architecture that can
process variable length, unordered sets. For this purpose,
we use Particle Flow Networks (PFN) [75, 76]. A reduced
alternative approach will use a ﬁxed number of high-level
observables, which will use a standard fully connected neu-
ral network. To distinguish these two cases, we will call
the full phase space version OmniFold and the reduced
version MultiFold.

A. OmniFold in the Presence of New Physics

The main beneﬁt of the OmniFold method comes from
its use of low-level observables and the freedom from ﬁxed
bins. By using information about each reconstructed par-
ticle in an event or jet, the full phase space is exploited.
Therefore, as long as the interaction of individual particles
with the the detector is modelled well, beyond the Stan-
dard Model (BSM) physics should not negatively aﬀect
the ability to unfold. If there is BSM physics present in
the data, then the most BSM-like events in Simulation
will be upweighted as appropriate1. In traditional un-
folding schemes that use regularized matrix inversion of
binned histograms, the presence of beyond the Standard
Model (BSM) physics could aﬀect the detector response
matrix in ways that are not accounted for in a SM-only
simulation. OmniFold is less aﬀected by this, and is not
aﬀected by the possibility of sub-optimal binning choices
for BSM sensitivity.

However, there is a key assumption in the Omni-
Fold method: the initial Simulation and the Data must
have overlapping support. For example, if a heavy reso-
nance existed at a mass well beyond the last data point
in Simulation, then it would not be possible to upweight
events to match the resonance even in a binned histogram
case. In the OmniFold case, the initial Simulation should
span the data in all dimensions. Empirically, the Sim-
ulations often used at the LHC share the same support
as Data. In practice, one needs the ratios of probability
densities to not be too far from unity because even if the
support is overlapping, a very small likelihood ratio will
have a large weight and thus poor statistical uncertainty.

III. SIMULATION AND MACHINE LEARNING
SETUP

√

Many models of new physics predict new heavy par-
ticles that decay to Standard Model particles.
If the
invariant mass of the decay particles is computed, a res-
onant enhancement in the mass spectrum should occur,
centered on the new particle’s mass. As an initial ex-
ploration of the eﬃcacy of OmniFold in the presence
of BSM physics, we consider the case of a new heavy
scalar particle. Our study is based on proton-proton col-
s = 14 TeV with Tune 26 [78] of
lisions generated at
Pythia 8.243 [79–81]. Signal events are generated as
h → Za, a → gg, where mh has been set to 125 or 250
GeV, and various a masses have been used. This ﬁnal
state (with low ma and mh = 125 GeV) was recently stud-
ied by the ATLAS Collaboration in Ref. [82]. Detector
eﬀects are emulated with Delphes 3.4.2 [83], using the
CMS detector card, which uses particle ﬂow reconstruc-
tion. For this study, the Data, Truth, Simulation, and
Generation sets consist of 200,000 events. Jets with radius
parameter R = 0.4 are clustered using either all particle
ﬂow objects (detector-level) or stable non-neutrino truth
particles (particle-level) with the anti-kT algorithm [84]
implemented in FastJet 3.3.2 [85, 86]. We consider
leptonic decays of the Z boson, which can be precisely
reconstructed. The target ﬁnal state is then Z boson
production in association with one jet that has non-trivial
substructure. Events are selected if there is at least one
truth-level and one detector-level particle within the jet2.
For OmniFold, we use all of the particles in the lead-
ing jet. Each particle is speciﬁed with its pT, rapidity,
y, azimuthal angle, φ, and particle identiﬁcation number.
Furthermore, the invariant mass of the Z+jet system, the
jet mass, and the jet multiplicity are included as global
features. These data are processed using PFNs imple-
mented in the EnergyFlow Python package [87]. The
PFN architecture is composed of an encoder followed by
a fully connected network. The encoder has two hidden
layers of 200 nodes each and outputs a 256-dimensional
latent vector. These vectors are summed over all parti-
cles and then the subsequent fully connected network is
composed of three layers of 100 nodes each.

For MultiFold, we use ten features from each event,
based on the Z boson properties and the leading jet.
These features include the invariant mass of the Z+jet
system, the jet mass, the jet constituent multiplicity, the
jet pT, the Z pT, the jet Les Houches Angularity [88, 89],
the jet width [89–92], the groomed jet mass with Soft
Drop parameters zcut = 0.1 and β = 0 [93], the groomed
jet momentum fraction (same Soft Drop parameters), and
the jet image activity, which is the minimum number of
pixels in a jet image that contain 95% the total pT [94].

1 Events may be downweighted in the case of interference eﬀects

2 We ignore acceptance eﬀects from the jet selection, which can be
made arbitrarily small in this case by using only the Z to choose
events.

The MultiFold neural networks are composed of three
hidden layers of 100 nodes each.

For each iteration of OmniFold and MultiFold, the
neural network was trained with 120 and 20 epochs, re-
spectively, and included an early stopping condition based
on validation loss improvement. The validation sample
was constructed from a random 20% of the events. The
models are randomly initialized in the ﬁrst iteration and
subsequently warm-started using the model from the pre-
vious iteration. All neural networks are implemented
using Keras [95] with the Tensorflow backend [96]
and optimized with Adam [97].

IV. HEAVY SCALAR DECAY STUDY

First, we study the case of mh = 250 GeV where 10%
of the data is BSM physics. This composition and signal
model relative to the Z+jets background are qualitatively
similar to the example presented in Ref. [69], which used
generative models.

Figure 2 shows the detector-level and truth-level distri-
butions of Z+jet invariant mass before and after unfolding.
At detector-level, which corresponds to the ﬁrst step in
an iteration of the OmniFold method, the distributions
exhibit good agreement after unfolding: the height and
width of the mass peak are reproduced accurately, espe-
cially in the MultiFold case. At truth-level, the peaks
are not reproduced as sharply. In the MultiFold case,
the height and width of the peak are similar to that seen
at detector level, and in the OmniFold case, the peak is
considerably broader.

Part of the broadening is an inherent challenge with
non-trivial resolutions and limited statistics. The truth-
level peak quality can be recovered by modifying the
Generation. We are free to choose whatever Generation
we want as OmniFold is a maximum likelihood estimator
that is prior-independent. However, the closer the prior is
to the data, the more accurate the unfolding will be with
ﬁnite statistics. To test this idea, the same Truth sample
was used as above, with 180,000 SM events and 20,000
h → Za, a → gg, where mh = 250 GeV and ma = 16
GeV. However, now the Generation was taken to include
200,000 SM events, 10,000 h → Za, a → gg events with
mh = 125 GeV for each of ma = 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16
GeV, and 10,000 h → Za, a → gg events with mh = 250
GeV for each of the same ma values, for a total of 320,000
events. The truth-level results of unfolding with the same
OmniFold setup discussed above are shown in Fig. 3.
Here, both the height and weight of the truth-level peak
are reproduced well by the reweighted sample. The fact
that this works well, when an application of OmniFold
with SM-only events did not, shows the importance of
suﬃciently covering the relevant regions of phase space.
Adding BSM physics to the Generation sample begs the
question of what the invariant mass distribution would
look like after unfolding if the Data does not itself contain
BSM physics. To test this, the same Generation sample

The Truth and Data distributions are a combination of 180,000
Pythia 8 Z+jet events and 20,000 h → Za, a → gg, where mh
= 250 GeV and ma = 16 GeV. The Generation and Simulation
are 200,000 SM-only events. The weights are taken after 5
iterations of the respective unfolding procedure. The triangular
discriminator [98–100] ∆(p, q) = R dλ (p(λ)−q(λ))2
is used to
quantify the diﬀerence between distributions.

Z+jet invariant mass. Not all new physics processes can
be searched for with such a simple approach. To explore
such a scenario, we consider mh = 125 GeV. In this case,
the signal bump is near the background peak and so
additional features beyond just the Z+jet invariant mass
are required. We explore the possibility of performing
a model-dependent search that uses dedicated BSM vs.
SM discriminating variables. If OmniFold eﬀectively
unfolds the full phase space, it should be possible to use
any combination of variables in unfolded data.

A. Unfolding with MultiFold

First, we can consider the case of MultiFold with

two working points for BSM physics:

• 0.1% of Data and Truth events are BSM physics,

with ma = 16 GeV.

• 10% of Data and Truth events are BSM physics,

with ma = 16 GeV.

For each working point, the Data, Truth, Simulation, and
Generation sets will be once again be 200,000 events. In
each case, the Simulation and Generation sets are drawn
from the SM-only Pythia 8 sample. The SM events
in Data and Truth are also drawn from the Pythia 8
sample, but no SM event can be used in both Data and
Simulation.

The distributions of Z+jet invariant mass, jet mass,
and jet multiplicity for Truth, Generation, and unfolded
Generation are shown in Fig. 5. The impact of a 0.1%
signal is diﬃcult to detect in these one-dimensional his-
tograms and MultiFold has correspondingly left the
phase space mostly untouched. For the 10% signal, Mul-
tiFold clearly improves the agreement of the distribu-
tions. Similar trends hold for alternative ma values as
well (not shown).

The ratio panels in Fig. 5 show that MultiFold is
qualitatively able to encode BSM physics in the unfolded
data. To probe this in greater detail, we emulate a model-
dependent search by training a fully supervised classiﬁer
to distinguish Z+jets events from the ma = 16 GeV
signal. A sample of 90,000 SM and 90,000 BSM events
was used for training, with 30% randomly held out as a
validation set. The neural network has the same inputs
and architecture as the one used for MultiFold4. If
MultiFold preserves the complete phase space, then
any threshold cut on this classiﬁer should have the same
eﬃciency with the unfolded data as it does with the Truth.
The number of Truth, Generation, and unfolded Gen-
eration events passing a cut on the neural network score,

the case that OmniFold is performed with BSM events in
Generation despite a lack of BSM events in Truth. The BSM
event included in the Generation were drawn from events with

after 5 OmniFold iterations.

with 320,000 events from the preceding paragraph is used
again, but Data and Truth are taken to be 200,000 SM-
only events. The OmniFold method is applied in the
same way as above, and the resulting Z+jet invariant
mass distributions are shown in Fig. 4. The bump in the
unfolded distribution has been eliminated despite the fact
that almost 40% of events in the Generation sample were
drawn from BSM samples. To optimize the unfolding,
care must be taken when choosing the BSM models to
include in the Generation sample as well as when choosing
the number of BSM events to include – manipulating these
parameters eﬀectively corresponds to choosing diﬀerent
priors for what is expected in the Data.

This section has demonstrated that OmniFold can
qualitatively preserve a relatively large3 and prominent
resonant signature from the data. A sideband technique
could then be used to perform a search with these data.
In the next section, we will explore the ability of Om-
niFold to precisely preserve the phase space so that a
multivariate classiﬁer could be used for a search with the
unfolded data.

V. EXOTIC HIGGS DECAY

The signal in Sec. IV was suﬃciently prominent that it
could be eﬀectively searched for with a bump hunt in the

3 In fact, the amount of signal is so large, that it would result
in a signiﬁcant detection from the cross-section alone, which is
well-known for Z+jets. We revisit this in Sec. VI.

4 It is important to note that in the MultiFold case, the neural
network is trained to distinguish between Data and Simulation,
whereas the discriminator neural network is trained to distinguish
truth-level SM events from BSM events.

as a function of the cut value, is shown in Fig. 6. In both
the 0.1% and 10% signal case, the number of events in the
reweighted samples more closely matches the Truth than
the raw Generation samples. The agreement between
the reweighted sample and Truth in the 10% case is an
impressive achievement, as the Truth and Unfolded yields
after the application of the NN score cut is stable at one.
The NN score is a specialized value that was not used in
training, so it is clear that in this case, the most BSM-like
events are being up-weighted to an appropriate degree.
In contrast, the unfolding has not up-weighted the BSM
events enough in the 0.1% case, highlighting the diﬃculty
of working with such a small signal.

B. Unfolding with OmniFold

An investigation similar to the MultiFold case can
be performed with OmniFold. The same ma and con-

Generation events passing a cut on the neural network score,
as a function of the cut value, in the case that 0.1% of the data
comes from BSM physics (top) and 10% of the data comes
from BSM physics (bottom). The unfolding was performed
with MultiFold. The neural network was speciﬁcally trained
to distinguish SM from BSM physics. The middle segment
of both plots shows the ratio of the pre- and post-unfolding
Generation yields to the Truth yield. The yield from the
pre-unfolding Generation is not expected to agree well with
the Truth, as there are no BSM events. However, if the most
BSM-like events get upweighted by the unfolding, then the
weighted sum of passing events increases. In a fully accurate
unfolding the unfolded yield would match the yield from Truth.
The bottom segment shows the fraction of Truth events that
are BSM events at truth-level; as the cut value approaches
1, the events passing the selection must be more BSM-like,
which is why the BSM-purity increases as a function of cut
value.

tamination values are investigated.

The distributions of Z+jet invariant mass, jet mass,
and jet multiplicity for Truth, Generation, and unfolded
Generation are shown in Fig. 7. The performance in these
plots is similar to but slightly worse than that observed
in Fig. 5.

It is also possible to train a PFN to distinguish SM
from BSM events. This PFN is set up in the same way
as the PFN used for OmniFold, but it is trained to
discriminate a sample of 90,000 SM from 90,000 BSM
events. Here, the area under the ROC curve is 0.94,

achieving superior discrimination to the neural network
described in Sec. V A (AUC of 0.73). Figure 8 shows the
number of Truth, Generation, and unfolded Generation
events that pass cuts on the PFN score. If this ﬁgure
is compared to Fig. 6, it is evident that the post-cut
yields in the OmniFold case do not agree with truth
as well as in the MultiFold case. This is due to the
challenges discussed in Sec. II A. When speciﬁcally trained
to discriminate SM from BSM events, the PFN is highly
accurate. The Generation sample poorly populates the
very BSM-like region of this discriminator. Especially
in the case of 0.1% contamination, the unfolded dataset
would not enable a discovery of new physics, as the weights
do not strongly aﬀect the post-cut yields.

C.

Including BSM Physics in Generation

Similar to the end of Sec. IV, we explore how the
performance in the previous section changes if we add in
BSM to the Generation. This can eﬀectively populate
the regions of phase space that are under-populated
by the SM to enable a more precise post-unfolding
search. For this purpose, we take the same 200,000 SM
events in Sec. V B and add 10,000 events each from
h → Za, a → gg samples with ma = 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and
16 GeV, for a total of 260,000 events in Generation. The
OmniFold method is carried out in exactly the same way
as in Sec. V B. Distributions for the invariant Z+jet mass,
jet mass, and jet multiplicity are shown in Fig. 9. By
comparing the triangular discriminator metric between
Fig. 9 and Fig. 7, it can be seen that when BSM physics
is included in the Generation, the distributions generally
agree slightly better after unfolding, particularly in
the case of 10% contamination, despite worse initial

The SM vs. BSM discriminator PFN of Sec. V B can
applied to this new Generation sample. The results of
this application are shown in Fig. 10. The PFN is also
able to discriminate events with diﬀerent ma values rel-
atively accurately5, and it is clear here that the Omni-
Fold reweighted sample does not predict post-cut yields
well. The average weights found for the diﬀerent ma
components of Generation are given in Table I. While
the ma = 16 GeV events are upweighted relative to the
lighter ma events, it is clear that in the 0.1% contamina-
tion case, the ma = 16 GeV events are not adequately

downweighted, and in the 10% contamination case, they
are not adequately upweighted. Together with Fig. 8, it
can be seen that while OmniFold is performed using
the full phase space, it has diﬃculty properly weighting
extreme regions of phase space that can be particularly
useful to model-dependent searches.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

The OmniFold and MultiFold methods can be used
for unbinned, all-variable unfolding in the presence of
BSM physics, but there are inherent limitations on its
applicability for truth-level searches for new physics.

In general, the distributions of high-level observables
are unfolded well, as in Fig. 2, 5, and 7. This would
enable model-independent searches or searches that use

with 200,000 SM Z+jet events, and 10,000 events each from
h → Za, a → gg samples with diﬀerent ma values, as given in
the table. Generation was used as an initial distribution for
unfolding to a Truth sample of 200,000 events that either had
0.1% or 10% of its events drawn from the h → Za, a → gg
sample with ma = 16 GeV. The average weight is 0.77 to match
the normalization of the Truth sample, which has 200,000
events total, rather than 260,000.

relatively high-level variables as discriminants, especially
if the new physics has a high cross-section. However, it
is possible to devise strong BSM vs. SM discriminating
variables that are not necessarily unfolded well, such as
the neural network scores shown in Fig. 6 and 8. These
discriminants, which probe relatively subtle regions of
phase space would most likely be applied in a model-
dependent search. While OmniFold uses the full phase
space, it has diﬃculty unfolding such specialized variables.
The best performance highlighted above is the 10% BSM
contamination case with MultiFold, where the post-cut
yield in the unfolded sample closely matches that found in
Data. In the 0.1% contamination case with MultiFold,
there is also an enhancement in the reweighted sample
relative to the Generation sample, but the agreement
with Truth is not as stable as the 10% case. Together
with the lack of agreement in the OmniFold case, this
suggests that it would be diﬃcult to make a discovery
of BSM physics unless the new physics comprises > 1%
of data events. Such high rates of BSM contamination
would likely be discovered through conventional means by
experimentalists prior to the release of unfolded datasets.
A signiﬁcant issue in any attempt to perform a search
with unfolded data is the inverse problem highlighted by
Fig. 2. Information is lost as particles pass through the
detector, as seen in the smearing of the truth-level peak.
We have shown how this can be partially recovered by
adding BSM events to the Generation. This also helps to

9

populate the most BSM-like regions of phase space. For
example, Fig. 3 shows that this can be a powerful means
to accurately reproduce an invariant mass peak even at
truth-level. However, this raises the natural question of
how to choose the correct events to include in Generation.
The study in Sec. V C highlights the fact that even though
high-level distributions can be unfolded well when BSM
events are included in Generation, specialized variables
may not be unfolded well; in particular, the reweighted
distributions in Fig. 9 are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from both
the Data and from what would be expected in a SM-only
case. Because of this, a model-dependent search with the
PFN discriminator would be ineﬀective in the 10% case
and return a false positive in the 0.1% case.

Overall, our studies have shown that full phase space
unfolding is a promising direction for post-measurement
searches for resonant new physics. However, signiﬁcant
work is required to increase the precision of the unfolding
and to cope with cases where there are phase space regions
with a large likelihood ratio. It is likely that non-resonant
new physics, which may be modeled using eﬀective ﬁeld
theory methods, will be more successful because the like-
lihood ratio is never too far from unity. This is closer to
the previously studied case that investigated the impact
of diﬀerent SM simulations [67]. The resonant examples
presented in this paper will serve as an important bench-
mark for the community as existing methods are extended
and new techniques are developed to empower a new class
of analyses at the LHC and beyond.
