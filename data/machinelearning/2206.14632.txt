Abstract
We report the discovery of a new short period pulsating variable in the ﬁeld of exoplanet host star XO-2. Variable has
been identiﬁed while it was being used as a comparison star. In order to verify the variability of the candidate, a follow-up
program was carried out. Period analysis of multi-band light curves revealed a very prominent and consistent pulsation
periodicity of P ∼ 0.95 hours. Given the variability period, amplitude and the color index, the object is most likely a
Delta Scuti type variable. Absolute magnitude (Mv) and the color index (B − V )0 of the star determined as 2.76 and
0.22, respectively. This (B − V )0 of the star corresponds to A7 spectral type with an approximate eﬀective temperature
of 7725 K. Machine-learning analysis of the time-series data also revealed that the object is of variable type DSCT with
a probability of 78%.

Introduction

Delta Scuti stars are pulsating variables with spectral types be-
tween A and F, especially from late A toward early F. They
are known with their radial and non-radial pulsations spanning
periods from 20 minutes to 8 hours (Breger et al. 2012). These
variables are mostly located on the zero-age main-sequence
in Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams within the so-called instability
strip. The amplitude of their variability mostly very small such
as ∆V = 0.01 − 0.03 mag. A subclass of Delta Scuti stars
is called as HADS (High-Amplitude Delta Scuti stars) due to
their high-amplitude variations (∆V = 0.3 − 1.0 mag) in their
light curves. Both classes are more massive (1.2 − 2.4M(cid:12)) and
hence more luminous than Sun (McNamara 2011).

Pulsation behaviour of Delta Scuti stars is an important
tool to understand the stellar interiors where Hydogen shell
burning takes place. These stars show both multi-mode pulsa-
tions with radial or non-radial directions. These modes or pulsa-
tion direction can exhibit diﬀerent behaviours even for the same
star (Mow et al. 2016). Studying the changes in these states
may provide insights about stellar structures. Therefore, ded-
icated observing campaigns are carried out both photometric
(Breger et al. 1993, 1994; Zhou et al. 2002) and spectroscopic
(Ventura et al. 2007).

Recent studies showed that many primary components in
Algol and beta-Lyrae type eclipsing binaries are in fact Delta
Scuti type stars (Kahraman Aliçavuş et al. 2017; Ulaş et al.
2020). Investigating these variables in binaries present an im-
portant advantage for determining the stellar masses accurately
which then can be used to model the stellar interiors.

Robotic telescopes or surveys from space allow to detect
numerous Delta Scuti variables like in the case of TESS (Antoci

et al. 2019) or OGLE (Soszyński et al. 2021). All these stars are
then used to construct or update the period-luminosity relation
which is a powerful tool to derive luminosities and thus dis-
tances for Delta Scuti variables (McNamara 2011; Poro et al.
2021).

In this study, we report the discovery of a new Delta Scuti
variable and present a comprehensive CCD photometry of the
object. The new variable has counterparts in both SDSS and
PanSTARRS which we provide the appropriate magnitudes in
Table 2. The star also observed with GAIA and has a parallax
in the EDR3 release. We determined the fundamental pulsa-
tion frequency and the ephemeris of the star for the ﬁrst time.
In Section 2, we brieﬂy summarize the observations and data
reduction, Section 3 presents light curves and period analysis
of the star, Section 4 discusses the variability type and the
physical parameters of the star and we summarize our study in
Section 5.

2 Observations and Data Reduction

2.1 CCD Observations

Exoplanet host star XO-2 has been observed within a research
program1 that investigates the transit timing variations with
a similar fashion given in Baştürk et al. (2022). During these
observations, variability of one of the comparison star in the
ﬁeld was noticed.

The ﬁeld was observed by the 0.4m Schmidt-Cassegrain
telescope (aka. IST40) of the Istanbul University Observatory.
Observations were carried out with a thermoelectric cooled
CCD consisting a KAF-8300 chip which has 3358x2536 pix-
els. Pixel size of 5.4µ yields 0.27"/pixel resolution at the focal

plane and this resolution allows to capture 16x12 arcminutes
ﬁeld of view.

CCD observations were performed over 10 nights between
23 February 2020 and 27 November 2020 at Istanbul University
Observatory. Log of observations is given in Table 1.

All frames were bias, dark and ﬂat-ﬁeld corrected in a stan-
dard manner. Several bias and dark frames were co-added in or-
der to create a master combined calibration frame. Flat-ﬁelding
was done with sky ﬂats obtained at dusk. Calibration images
were obtained in each observing night.

2.2 Photometry

Following the identiﬁcation of the variable, a comprehensive
follow-up program was carried out in February, March, and
November 2020 with a total of 10 nights. After conﬁrmation
of the candidate as a new variable star using unﬁltered obser-
vations, standard Johnson-Cousins B, V, and R ﬁltered frames
were also taken.

In order to determine comparison stars a thorough in-
spection of the ﬁeld stars, almost a dozen, was undertaken.
After several ﬁeld stars examined and diﬀerential light curves
constructed, stars denoted as C1 and C2 were determined as
the most reliable comparison stars. A representative magni-
tude variation between C1 and C2 is given in Figure 2. Typical
magnitude variation among observing nights varies between 5
mmag and 9 mmag. Strong reliability of frame-to-frame varia-
tions ensure neither C1 nor C2 is a variable star, at least in the
duration of the present observations.

Coordinates and basic information of the newly identiﬁed
variable, comparison stars and the original target of exoplanet
host star, XO-2, are given in Table 2 and those stars are marked
in the ﬁeld image given in Figure 1.

Instrumental magnitudes were determined with aperture
photometry using Muniwin software of the C-Munipack 2 pack-
age (Hroch 2014). Photometry procedures of the C-Munipack
package are based on the well-known DAOPHOT (Stetson
1987) package.

Since both comparison stars, C1 and C2, show constant
magnitudes over the observation period, diﬀerential magnitudes
presented in this study were computed using the comparison
star C2.

parison stars are not variable.

3 Light Curve Analysis

3.1 Period Analysis

In order to obtain period of the variation we make use of Pe-
riod04 (Lenz & Breger 2005) which is extensively used in the
asteroseismology community. Period04 allows us to model vari-
ations by means of Fourier modes and it is possible to include
multi-frequency variations in the ﬁnal model. However, our aim
is to characterize the newly discovered variable, hence we model
the variations with a single frequency to avoid the complexity.
Moreover, the discontinuity in our observations and diﬀerent
ﬁlters used in our study would not allow a thorough multi-
frequency analysis. Additionally, it is worth noting that the
variable has also been observed by the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS) at a long (i.e. 30 minutes) cadence.
The available ﬂuxes are not suitable for a detailed analysis.

Table 3 lists the obtained frequencies, associated errors
and their corresponding periods in days. The error of each fre-
quency were estimated using Monte-Carlo simulations as de-
scribed in Lenz & Breger (2005). Power spectra of the com-
bined data of each ﬁlter are given in Fig. 6.

Figs. 3, 4, and 5 shows light curves of the object in diﬀerent
ﬁlters (i.e. B, V, R, and Clear). In each panel, corresponding
best-ﬁt frequency given in Table 3 is shown as the model (solid)
line.

For a ﬁrst approach we assume all the periods with equal
weights and obtained an average period for the variable as
P = 0.940049 hrs. The best observation night is the 20200301
(UT) based on the temporal coverage and the weather condi-
tion of that night. The average period that we obtained using
all available data is consistent with the period obtained in the
best night of P = 0.9514546 hrs.

3.2 Times of Maxima

We computed times of maxima of the variable using the Kwee
& van Woerden method (Kwee & van Woerden 1956). This
method requires a homogeneous temporal coverage of the max-

imum (or the minimum in eclipsing binaries). Thus, we use the
data halfway from the maximum light at each side. In result,
we omit maxima when the ascending or the descending portion
of the light curve is not complete. In this way, we ensure the
precision of the maxima times given in Table 4. All times in the
table are converted into Heliocentric Julian Date (HJD). Since
we impose the completeness of the light curve for the times of
maximum, we could also measure the amplitude of the light
variation associated with a given maximum.

We computed the ephemeris of the variable by using the
all available maximum times irrespective of the ﬁlter used. Em-
ploying a linear ﬁt to the maximum times reveals the ephemeris
below:

Tmax (HJD) = 0.039439 × E + 58903.36375

In Fig. 7 we folded all observations according to the period
obtained from the data of the same ﬁlter. Each panel in the
ﬁgure shows speciﬁc ﬁlters (i.e. V, R, and Clear) and diﬀerent
colors represent diﬀerent observing nights.

4 Variability Type

Variability behaviour of the source is similar with those of short
period pulsators. The period of variability and the shape of the
light curve imply that the variable is likely a Delta Scuti star
(Sterken & Jaschek 2005). However, we wanted to test this
with a machine-learning approach described below.

To determine the variability type of the object, we used
UPSILoN (AUtomated Classiﬁcation of Periodic Variable Stars
using MachIne LearNing) package from the Python library (Kim
& Bailer-Jones 2016). UPSILoN essentially aims to automati-
cally classify variable sources from their optical light curve. It
essentially contains two parts; the ﬁrst part is extracting fea-
tures from a light curve, and the other part is utilizing features
for classiﬁcation.

The UPSILoN is using the random forest model for clas-
siﬁcation. Random forest classiﬁers are based on a collection
of decision trees (Huang et al. 2020; Quinlan 1993). For each
decision tree, a random subset of input features is selected and
used to build the tree. Models are using 16 extracted features
to predict a class.

The package is able to diﬀerentiate variable sources of six

variability types. These types are the followings: Delta Scuti,
RR Lyrae, Cepheid, Type-II Cepheid, eclipsing binary, and long-
period variables. The algorithm is trained with light curves ob-
tained from OGLE and EROS-2 surveys. A total of 143,923
stars have been used for training sample where 3209 of them
were of type Delta Scuti.

We compiled all time series data according to the observed
ﬁlter and fed into the UPSILoN. For all data the most plausible
classiﬁcation is returned as Delta Scuti. The probability of being
a Delta Scuti variable for the diﬀerent ﬁlters are as follows: 69%
(B), 83% (V), 76% (R), and 82% (Clear). In conclusion, it is
possible to state the new variable is of Delta Scuti with a mean
probability of 78%.

We should mention that this detection of the variability
type does not include all known variable classes but the well-
known ones. In order to reach a conclusion on the variability
type, one needs to have the luminosity and the eﬀective tem-
perature of the object as we show in the next section.

4.1 Physical parameters

Following the determination of the variability type as Delta
Scuti, we computed the absolute magnitude (Mv) and the in-
trinsic B-V color index using the calibrations given by McNa-
mara (2011):

Mv = (−2.89 ± 0.13) log(P ) − (1.31 ± 0.10)

(2)

(B − V )0 = (0.125 ± 0.006) log(P ) + (0.397 ± 0.006)

(3)

Eq. 2 is actually the period-luminosity relation. P is the pulsa-
tion period in days in the both Eqs. 2 and 3. Both equations are
valid for solar metallicity but this is not a concern as Delta Scuti
variables are mostly considered as solar-type stars. Thus, we ob-
tained the absolute magnitude in V-band as Mv = 2.76 ± 0.28
and intrinsic color index of (B −V )0 = 0.22±0.01. For a sanity
check, we also determined the (B − V ) of the variable using

the transformation equations given in Karaali et al. (2005) to-
gether with the Sloan magnitudes given in Table 2 and found
exactly the same value of (B − V )0 = 0.22.

This (B − V )0 translates into an eﬀective temperature
of 7770 ± 200 K when we take into account the calibrations
given by Cox (2000). This color index also corresponds to the
spectral type A7 (Bessell 1979). The error value of the Teﬀ
mainly comes from the color index calibrations as stated in
Bessell (1979) and Sekiguchi & Fukugita (2000). However, an
exact error term for the eﬀective temperature was not given
in those calibrations. Thus, we adopted here a relatively con-
servative error (i.e. 200 K) for the eﬀective temperature. The
error contribution of the Eq. 3 is very small compared to this
error term.

This eﬀective temperature and the spectral type is consis-
tent with typical properties of Delta Scuti stars (Breger 2007).
The variable has been observed with Gaia (Gaia Collabo-
ration et al. 2016) (Gaia EDR3 982385743606251648 ) and we

obtained the parallax from the Gaia EDR3 catalogue (Gaia Col-
laboration et al. 2021) as 0.5627 mas (±0.0178 mas). There-
fore, the distance to the variable based on its Gaia parallax is
1722+54

−58 pc.
Adopting a bolometric correction of BC = −0.122 (Cox
2000) yields Mbol = 2.64 ± 0.28 which then used together
with Mbol,(cid:12) = 4.74 to derive the luminosity of the variable as
L = 6.93+1.58

−2.04 L(cid:12).

The derived values of eﬀective temperature and lumi-
nosity locate the variable between the evolutionary tracks of
1.5 − 1.7 M(cid:12) stars as shown in Fig. 8. The evolutionary
tracks shown in Fig. 8 were computed using MESA (Modules
for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) codes (Paxton et al.
2011). The bolometric magnitude mass calibration given in Ja-
farzadeh & Poro (2017) reveals the mass for the variable as
M = 1.57 ± 0.1 M(cid:12) which is consistent with the evolutionary
tracks. This result is consistent with the location of Delta Scuti
stars on the H-R diagram.

5 Summary and Conclusions

We present the detection of a new variable in the ﬁeld of ex-
oplanet host star XO-2. The new variable has been observed
in 10 nights with diﬀerent standard photometric ﬁlters besides
white light observations. Both the shape of the light curves and
the automated classiﬁcation based on machine learning algo-
rithms reveal the candidate is a Delta Scuti with latter have
the probability of 78%.

Examining individual light curves allowed us to measure 32
times of maxima which also enabled to determine the ephemeris
of the variable for the ﬁrst time. Hence, the pulsation period
of the new variable determined as P = 0.039439 days.

With the help of the fundamental calibrations we could
obtain the astrophysical parameters of the variable and located
it on the evolutionary tracks at the H-R diagram. Thus, the
new variable has a mass between 1.5 − 1.7 M(cid:12). The variable is
of A7 spectral type with an approximate eﬀective temperature

TJAA Vol. 0, Issue 0, p.(0000).

of 7725 K which are consistent with typical properties of Delta
Scuti stars.

Further observations are needed to investigate any possible
variability of amplitude and/or frequency changes in the system
or to study multi-mode pulsation behaviour in detail. Recent
observations of the TESS in the Sector 47 cover the variable
where only the full-frame images are available at the moment.
Additional ground-based observations can be coupled together
the TESS short cadence observations to perform a deeper study
of the new variable.

Figure 8. Evolutionary tracks for low-mass stars computed with
MESA codes (Paxton et al. 2011). The location of the variable is
marked with a red point which is between the tracks of 1.5 − 1.7 M(cid:12)
stars. Error on the luminosity comes from the period-luminosity rela-
tion and the bolometric correction whereas the error on the eﬀective
temperature mainly comes from the color index calibration given in
Cox (2000).
