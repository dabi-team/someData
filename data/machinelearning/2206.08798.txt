Abstract

Quantum Chemistry (QC) is one of the most promising applications of Quantum

Computing. However, present quantum processing units (QPUs) are still subject

to large errors. Therefore, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware is

limited in terms of qubits counts and circuit depths. Speciﬁc algorithms such as

Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) can potentially overcome such issues.

Here, we introduce a novel open-source QC package, denoted OpenVQE, provid-

ing tools for using and developing chemically-inspired adaptive methods derived

from Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC). It facilitates the development and testing of

VQE algorithms. It is able to use the Atos Quantum Learning Machine (QLM), a

general quantum programming framework enabling to write, optimize and simulate

quantum computing programs. The QLM comes with a speciﬁc, freely available and

open-source module, myQLM-fermion, that provides key tools to perform QC com-

putations on a quantum computer (fermionic second quantization tools, UCC ansatz,

etc). We give an extensive introduction to myQLM-fermion. Our package, Open-

VQE, largely extends the QC capabilities of the QLM by providing: (i) the functions

to generate the diﬀerent types of excitations beyond the commonly used UCCSD

ansatz; (ii) a new implementation of the "adaptive derivative assembled pseudo-

Trotter method" (ADAPT-VQE), written in simple class structure python codes.

Interoperability with other major quantum programming frameworks is ensured

thanks to myQLM, which allows users to easily build their own code and execute

it on existing QPUs such as IBM, Google, Rigetti or Microsoft, etc. The com-

bined OpenVQE/myQLM-fermion libraries facilitate the implementation, testing

and development of variational quantum algorithms, thus helping choose the best

compromise to run QC computations on present quantum computers while oﬀering

the possibility to test large molecules. We provide extensive benchmarks for sev-
eral molecules associated to qubit counts ranging from 4 up to 24 where we focus

our work on reaching chemical accuracy, reducing the number of circuit gates and

optimizing parameters and operators between "ﬁxed-length" UCC and ADAPT-VQE

ansatze.

INTRODUCTION

HAIDAR ET AL

Solving the Schrödinger equation to obtain the many-electron wavefunction is the central problem of modern quantum chem-
istry 1,2. In practice, it is possible to achieve full accuracy for systems that contain few electrons through methods like the Full
Conﬁguration Interaction (FCI) and the Full Coupled-Cluster (FCC), which include all the electron conﬁgurations. However,
the computational cost grows exponentially when the number of electrons increases, as the dimension of the FCI and FCC wave
functions. For example, the number of possible Slater determinants increases as a function of the number of electrons 𝑛𝑒
and of
orbitals 𝑛𝑜

dim ≈

𝑛𝑜!
(𝑛𝑜 − 𝑛𝑒∕2)!(𝑛𝑒∕2)!

Attempts to reach full accuracy on large systems clearly faces the so-called “exponential wall” that limits the applicability of the
most accurate methods to more complex chemical systems. So far, the largest calculations performed with classical supercom-
puters have only included tens of billions of determinants (see 4) with (20 electrons, 20 orbitals) with hopes to solve problems
of a size close to a trillion determinants (24 electrons, 24 orbitals) in a near future thanks to the advances of massively parallel
supercomputer architectures. 5 Given such constraints, other classes of methods have to be used to approximate the ground state
wavefunctions for larger many electrons systems. They include: (i) Density-Functional Theory (DFT), which relies on the use
of a single Slater determinant, and has been shown to be extremely successful while failing to describe strongly correlated sys-
tems 6,7,8; (ii) post Hartree-Fock methodologies such as the truncated Coupled-Cluster (CC) and the Conﬁguration Interaction
(CI) approaches that, even though being still operational beyond the single Slater determinant, cannot be applied to large size
molecules, due to their extreme computational requirements in terms of Slater determinants 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. A good example
is provided by the “gold standard” methods denoted coupled-cluster single-, double-, plus perturbative triple-excitations
CCSD(T). Indeed, CCSD(T) is able to handle a few thousands basis functions, but at the cost of an enormous operation counts
that is limited by the large requirements in term of data storage. 17 No matter the choice of chemical basis sets (STO-3G, 6-31G,
cc-pVDZ, and beyond...), these methods are insuﬃcient to reach accurate enough results for large molecules.

A paradigm shift proposed by Feynman 18,19 is to use quantum computers for simulating quantum systems. This has prompted
the community to use quantum computers in order to solve the quantum chemistry wavefunction problems. Intuitively, the advan-
tage comes from the fact that quantum computers can process “exponentially” more information than classical computers 20.
Recent reviews provide a background about strategies for developing quantum algorithms dedicated to Quantum Chemistry.
These approaches include techniques such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs)
or quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE). 21,22,23,24. All methods generally include three key steps: (i) transforming the
wavefunction into qubits; (ii) constructing circuits with one and two-qubit quantum gates; (iii) using the circuits to measure the
expectation value of a given Hamiltonian. However, currently, available quantum computers remain in the Noisy Intermediate-
Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and are limited by two main resources: the number of qubits and the circuit depth (i.e. number of
quantum gates) 25,26,27,28. Among all available strategies, the VQE family of techniques is a very promising algorithm that can
be applied to NISQ hardware 21,29,30,21,31. Indeed, it is better suited to such devices than other algorithms such as QPE, thanks
to its more modest requirements in term of quantum processor coherence times and it has already been successfully executed
on real NISQ quantum computers based on various technologies including superconducting qubits 32,33, photons 29 and trapped
ions 34. It is known that the performance of VQE algorithms is highly dependent on the type of wavefunction ansatz. In practice,
several types of ansatze can be used including: unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) wavefunctions 35,36, hardware-eﬃcient 33,37, qubit
coupled cluster (QCC) 38, deep multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (DMERA) 39 and Hamiltonian variational 40.
Furthermore, there are recent hybrid approaches such as adaptive ansatz 41 and subspace expansion method 42, that also utilize
the basic VQE scheme to build the wavefunction of the system.

In this article, we provide a newly-designed software package named "OpenVQE" that extends the Atos Quantum Learning
Machine ("QLM"). QLM is a quantum computing platform that allows to write hardware-agnostic quantum programs, com-
pile them in compliance with hardware constraints, and either emulate them classically with realistic noise or execute them on
actual quantum hardware. QLM is a mix between commercial tools and non-commercial ones provided by the Atos company.
OpenVQE is fully compatible with the freely available (open source) component of QLM called "myQLM", which is available

HAIDAR ET AL

online 43. myQLM is a quantum software stack for writing, simulating, optimizing, and executing quantum programs. It pro-
vides within a python interface: (i) a powerful semantics for manipulating quantum circuits, with support for universal as well
as custom gate sets, abstract parameters, advanced linking options, etc; (ii) a versatile execution stack for running quantum jobs,
including an easy handling of observables, special plugins for carrying out NISQ-oriented variational methods (such as VQE
or QPE), and easy application programming interface for writing customized plugins (e.g., for compilation or error mitigation),
as well as for connecting to any Quantum Processing Unit (QPU); (iii) a seamless interface to available quantum processors and
major quantum programming frameworks 44. The capacity of QLM/myQLM to interoperate with other packages such Qiskit 45,
Cirq 46 and PyQuil 47 etc, allows researchers from diﬀerent horizons to communicate, interact, exchange, and work more eﬃ-
ciently and faster. Furthermore, myQLM acts as an intermediate for users who want to access quantum computers (IBM, Google
etc...), providing them simple keys to run directly their jobs. myQLM comes with fermionic second quantization tools, which are
helpful for solving quantum chemistry problems. These tools are now included in a new specialized open source module called
"myQLM-fermion" that is part of the present work and designed to work synergistically with OpenVQE. It includes the key
QLM ressources that are important for Quantum Chemistry developments. In particular, we use two important tools provided
by myQLM-fermion which are useful for quantum resource reductions 35: (i) an active space (AS) selection approach that is use-
ful for the reduction of the number of qubits; (ii) MP2 pre-screening approach that involves an implementation of second order
Møller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) amplitudes as an input guess that is useful for faster parameter optimization. By using the
initial myQLM building blocks, we were able to design our OpenVQE package, which provides the community with advanced
VQE tools especially dedicated to quantum chemistry problems needed to be solved by quantum computers. OpenVQE mainly
includes simple modules dedicated to the UCC family and to adaptive ansatze algorithms. These modules comprise various
features including:

1. diﬀerent types of UCC generators (truncated to single and double excitations): (i) Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and
Doubles (UCCSD 48) approaches; (ii) Unitary Pair CC with Generalized Singles and Doubles Product (k-UpCCGSD 49)
techniques; (iii) the possibility of including excitations that form spin-complemented pair interactions 41 and excitations
that conserve only singlet spin symmetry of UCCGSD (see appendix of 50); (iv) Qubit Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles
and Doubles QUCCSD 51;

2. adaptive VQE algorithms (namely Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter-VQE (ADAPT-VQE)), with diﬀerent
operator pools including: (i) Unitary fermionic operators (fermionic ADAPT-VQE 41); (ii) Anti-Hermitian Pauli operators
(qubit ADAPT-VQE 50,52).

These modules are structured in simple python classes requiring to write only a few lines of code. Furthermore, they provide
examples for the facile and rapid implementation of additional algorithms on the basis of myQLM basic tools.
The goal of the paper is to showcase the novel OpenVQE/myQLM-fermion combined quantum simulator package that enables
researchers to test, develop and measure the computational requirements of VQE ﬂavors towards their future potential imple-
mentation on real supercomputers. It allows to compare the accuracy of the total molecular energies obtained thanks to various
variants of the UCC method to popular quantum chemistry methods using classical computers. The GitHub websites of Open-
VQE 53 and myQLM-Fermion 54 are public, under "MIT" and "Apache-2.0" licenses, respectively.
The paper is organized as follows: we review the theory of UCC ansatze including the diﬀerent types of excitations, the ADAPT-
VQE approach and the diﬀerent steps needed to implement it (section 2). We then introduce the QLM library, speciﬁcally its
myQLM-fermion open source extension while focusing for the ﬁrst time on the quantum chemistry tools that can help us to
develop OpenVQE (see section 3). We then describe OpenVQE and its several implementations of the UCC and ADAPT-VQE
families of methods and show how myQLM-fermion components can be used to develop those modules through simple codes
(section4). Finally, applying OpenVQE to our in-house HPC architecture (QLM simulator server at Total energies), we simu-
late a full set of molecules ranging from 4 to 24 qubits. We ﬁrst show the properties of the simulator applied to a set of small
molecules. Second, we describe how OpenVQE/myQLM-fermion can use the active space selections and MP2 pre-screening
initial guesses through computations on diﬀerent test molecules. Then using the UCC methods module we compare the UCCSD
to QUCCSD ansatz in terms of quantum gates, and then compare the chemical accuracy achieved by these algorithms to those
obtained by robust computational methods using classical computers. Afterwards, using our ADAPT-VQE module we compare
the fermionic and qubit ADAPT-VQE results obtained on a set of molecules in terms of chemical accuracy, numbers of varia-
tional parameters, operators and quantum gates. We detail a speciﬁc analysis for each of the fermionic and qubit ADAPT-VQE.
Finally, we compare the group of "ﬁxed-length" ansatze to the ADAPT-VQE (section5). We conclude with a Table compar-
ing the features of the OpenVQE/myQLM-fermion packages with those implemented in other software packages, while giving

some perspectives towards the development of new types of UCC ansatze and/or new variational algorithms within OpenVQE
in order to eﬃciently solve quantum chemistry problems.

Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)

2.1
The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (or VQE) has been ﬁrst developed by Peruzzo et al. 29 and has received signiﬁcant attention
of a given Hamiltonian 𝐻 either in
from the research community in recent years. It aims at ﬁnding the ground state energy 𝐸0
quantum chemistry, condensed matter, or nuclear physics. In our work and since we mainly focus on the quantum chemistry
problems, our Hamiltonian model is written in the fermionic second quantization form as:

𝐻 =

∑

𝑝𝑞

ℎ𝑝𝑞𝑐†

𝑝 𝑐𝑞 +

1
2

∑

𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑠

ℎ𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑠𝑐†

𝑝 𝑐†

𝑞 𝑐𝑟𝑐𝑠,

(2)

𝑝 (𝑐𝑞) are anti-commuting operators that create (annihilate) electrons in spin-orbital 𝑝(𝑞), respectively. The symbols ℎ𝑝𝑞
denote the one- and two-body integrals of the corresponding operators and spin-orbitals in Dirac notation, respectively.

where 𝑐†
and ℎ𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑠
These integrals can be easily computed on a classical computer.
The VQE method is based on quantum variational theory, whose starting point is the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle, which
states that

⟨𝜓(𝜃)|𝐻|𝜓(𝜃)⟩

≥ 𝐸0,

(3)

. An iterative
, that,
|𝜓(𝜃)⟩

namely the energy of the normalized “trial” function
process minimizes the expectation value 𝐸(𝜃) = ⟨𝜓(𝜃)|𝐻|𝜓(𝜃)⟩
eventually, converges and gives an approximation of 𝐸0

|𝜓(𝜃)⟩

at the end of the process.

provides an upper bound for the ground state energy 𝐸0
with respect to the parameterized trial state

VQE is an hybrid classical-quantum implementation of the above variational iterative method that beneﬁts from using both
classical and quantum computers. It uses the quantum computer for the state preparation and energy measurement evaluations
which are the costly part in the VQE process, and the classical computer for performing the optimization required to update
the quantum state of the system. In order to see how this process works, we outline below the steps needed to perform a single
iteration of the VQE algorithm (see for example Figure 1 in 29):

1. Preparation of the trial state

on the quantum computer (or Quantum Processing Unit, QPU) with a circuit which

includes a set of one- and two-qubit parameterized gates (or even multi-qubit gates used for example for trapped ion case 55) .

|𝜓(𝜃)⟩

2. Once the circuit is prepared, the energy of the Hamiltonian given in Eq. 2 is measured. This is done by transforming it from
a fermionic to a qubit representation (using e.g., the Jordan Wigner (JW) transformation 56). This allows to express it as a sum
of Pauli strings (i.e. tensor products of Pauli operators):

𝐻 =

∑

𝑗

ℎ𝑗𝑃𝑗,

(4)

with 𝑃𝑗 = ∏𝑛𝑜−1
is a Pauli matrix involving qubit 𝑖. Once the Hamiltonian is written in this basis, the energy is
computed by measuring the expectation value of each Pauli string over the qubit representation of the circuit, and summing over

, where 𝜎𝑖

the measurements. The results of multiple measurements are then averaged to obtain the energy

𝐸(𝜃) =

∑

𝑗

ℎ𝑗⟨𝜓(𝜃)|

𝑛𝑜−1
∏

𝑖=0

𝜎𝑗
𝑖 |𝜓(𝜃)⟩.

3. The energy and qubit rotation parameters are then fed into a classical computer that runs an optimisation algorithm (e.g.,
COBYLA, SLSQP or BFGS) 57, which returns a new set of parameters. In order to reach convergence faster, initial guesses of
ansatz parameters of cluster operators obtained from the second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory can be used. 35

4. The new set of parameters then used to prepare a new parametrized circuit from which a new sum over Pauli strings

expectation values, and hence a new energy expectation value, is calculated.

5. The previous two steps are repeated until a convergence criterion, typically the diﬀerence in energy between VQE iterations,
is below some threshold value, controlled by the conditions of the chosen optimizer method. To get more information about VQE,
the interested reader could refer to a detailed analysis of the algorithm by Cao et al. 22 and to a review detailing its application to
quantum chemistry 21. An overview of VQE eﬃciency using NISQ devices has also been recently proposed by Bharti et al. 28.

Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) approach within VQE

2.2
The degree of accuracy with which VQE obtains an approximate minimum energy of an electronic structure Hamiltonian with a
very good approximation of the ground state depends on several keys features such as the choice of the quantum state prepared
on a quantum device (circuit), the iterative solver, the number of iterations, the number of CC excited levels.
The unitary coupled cluster (UCC) approach, which is inspired from the classical coupled cluster computational method 58,59,9,15,
has been shown to be a good choice for reaching accurate results. It was originally introduced to the area of quantum chemistry
computations 14 and was later successfully implemented using quantum computers 60,29 thanks to its inherent simplicity. A com-
prehensive review of the UCC method is given in 35,36. UCC yields variational states prepared by using unitary evolution under a
sum of fermionic terms associated with their variational parameters. These terms represent the fermionic excitations that occur
on the top of the initial Hartree Fock (HF) state. The UCC wavefunction can be then expressed as follows:

|𝜓UCC⟩ = 𝑒𝑇 −𝑇 †

|𝜓HF⟩

(6)

where 𝑇 is the cluster operator and 𝑇 † is its Hermitian conjugate. As 𝑇 is the sum of the excitations at diﬀerent levels 𝑇 = 𝑇1

are variational parameters associated with their cluster operators. They ensure that UCC
applied within VQE can approximate the true ground eigenstate of the system, which is not guaranteed in the case for example
of the hardware eﬃcient ansatz, whose parameters are not chemically inspired. Preparing UCC ansatz on a classical computer
cannot be easily performed even for low-ordered cluster operators due to the non-truncation of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀ
(BCH) series 61. On the contrary, it can be prepared on a quantum device, and it has been shown that VQE can yield a ﬁnal state
of right parametrization with a good overlap that preserves the ﬁdelity close to one (e.g. with an overlap
close to
one, between the converged UCC solution and the FCI solution 𝜓0

⟨𝜓𝑈 𝐶𝐶 |𝜓0⟩

).

Implementation of Unitary Coupled Cluster on quantum devices

2.2.1
In this subsection, we describe in detail the implementation of the UCC wavefunction on a quantum computer, which is an
important component in the VQE steps described above. The UCC wavefunction in Eq. (6) is implemented on a quantum
device by ﬁrst constructing a circuit corresponding to the qubit representation of the HF state state (by implicitly using JW
representation)

6

HAIDAR ET AL

following these steps: 𝑈 (𝜃) has to be ﬁrst decomposed into operations that can be implemented into circuit compatible with
present available quantum computers. To do this, in practice, 𝑈 (𝜃) is approximated using the Trotter decomposition 62,63,64, which
breaks up the exponential of a sum to an ordered product of individual exponentials. Such transformation provides a reasonable
approximation to the full unitary operator which is disassembled into local unitary operators. Following Eqs. (1.3-1.6) in 65, the
formula of trotterized 𝑈 (𝜃) with 𝑇 − 𝑇 † (Eq. 7) truncated at 𝑥 = 2 excitations can be expressed as:

(

∏

𝜃𝜌

𝑒

(𝑇𝜌−𝑇 †
𝜌 )

𝑈 (𝜃) ≈

𝜌

+  (

)

(8)

where 𝑡 is the number of Trotter steps and 𝜌 corresponds to the elements of excitations introduced in Eq. 7. Orders of 𝑡 above
one can decrease the Trotterization error, however for the current available NISQ devices, it is not recommended since it would
involve additional gates induced by the UCC ansatz translation into a quantum-circuit 66,36. Nevertheless, as is shown in Figure
5 of reference 66, by using UCCSD method in H
molecule, increasing the trotter error does not aﬀect the convergence and the
2
UCCSD energy. In the present work, we use an UCC ansatz truncated at the single and double excitations levels while we employ
a single Trotter step. Once these approximations are performed, each exponential of a fermionic excitation operator (see Eq. (8))
can be directly implemented as a quantum circuit, i.e. as a series of parameterized gates 𝑈 (𝜃) = 𝑈1(𝜃1)𝑈2(𝜃2)𝑈3(𝜃3)...𝑈𝑘(𝜃𝑘)
applied to the qubits, where 𝑈𝑘(𝜃𝑘) is the 𝑘𝑡ℎ one- or two-qubit unitary gate, controlled by a 𝜃𝑘
parameter. Having 𝑈 (𝜃) prepared

Exponential mappings

2.2.2
The CNOT staircase 21,25,34 is the standard method to map the exponential of the fermionic excitation evolution (after JW
transformation) into a sequence of gates. In theory, the JW transformation relates spin-1/2 operators to fermionic creation and
annihilation operators. JW is the basic transformation we used through the article. Mapping the UCC ansatz from this method
has been shown to provide accurate results associated to a smooth optimization convergence 21. However, the cost of using such
a method is linked to the increase in the number of CNOT gates, which scales linearly with the system size 𝑂(𝑛𝑜) when a JW
transformation is used 50. Consequently, it limits the size of molecule that can be tested on available NISQ devices. Nevertheless
this method has been extensively tested using diﬀerent types of fermionic excitation presented in the next section. They include:
UCCSD and UCCGSD, k-UpCCGSD ansatze. There are also other types of excitations that generate other versions of the UCC
ansatze (see 36 for example) but they are out of the scope of the present work. Additional work has been done towards optimizing
the number CNOT counts gates and circuit depth by constructing CNOT- eﬃcient circuits 67,68,69 in order to implement unitary
evolutions of single and double qubit excitation operators, which obey to the qubit commutation relations. The resulting circuits
require up to 2 (8) times fewer CNOTs in the case of single (double) fermionic excitation evolutions than within the standard
method. This type of qubit evolution can be used to construct a new version of the UCC ansatz which is called QUCCSD (see
next section). Mappings of both exponentials corresponding to fermionic and qubit excitation evolutions through CNOT stair-
case and eﬃcient circuit methods are explained in detail in chapter two of 70, as well as a brief explanation of the deﬁnitions of
CNOT gates and depth from the two circuit methods.

Unitary Coupled Cluster approaches truncated at single and double excitations levels
2.3
In this subsection we list the diﬀerent versions of UCC that are truncated at the single and double excitation levels, by deﬁning
the excitation generator in each UCC version. We review as well their recent use within variational algorithms. We ﬁrst focus
on the UCCSD and QUCCSD ansatze for comparison purposes on the scale of gate complexity and CNOT counts. We then
focus on a second group of methods that includes UCCGSD and k-UpUCCGSD, which as is shown in some reviews, it performs
better in term of chemical accuracy than the ﬁrst group of ansatze. However, it has been shown that such approaches require an
increased circuit depth than the ﬁrst group of techniques. These features have motivated us to implement these versions of UCC
together with ADAPT-VQE (presented in the next section) in our OpenVQE package (see sec 4).

UCCSD and QUCCSD ansatze

𝑎(𝑞𝑖) are the qubit creation (annihilation) operators without the inclusion of Z-Pauli terms after JW transformation
where 𝑞†
(see their expressions in chapter two, section 2.2 (Eqs. 2.11 and 2.12) of 70). These excitations can be achieved by particle-
preserving exchange gate rotations in the qubit space. It diﬀers from UCCSD ansatz, which contains many Z-Pauli terms after
JW transformation. The actual role of 𝑍-Pauli is to conserve the parity from fermionic creation (annihilation) 𝑐†(𝑐) operators,
while keeping the time-symmetry and particle conservation. By comparing QUCCSD to UCCSD ansatz VQE performance for
a few simple molecules, it has been shown 51 that the two ansätze could achieve a nearly identical accuracy in the estimation
of the ground state energies. Even though the parity property is missed in the qubit evolution excitations, it was found, as is
explained in previous section, that the advantage of using QUCCSD is to reduce the CNOT counts with respect to the CNOT
staircase circuit to implement fermionic evolutions. This demonstrates that QUCCSD is suﬃcient to approximate the exact FCI
wavefunction with a smaller number of gates in the circuit and it might be more favorable for its use on current NISQ devices.
However it has been also shown that an unnecessarily large number of parameters and operators occur when the UCCSD and
QUCCSD ansatze were used especially when system size gets larger. The increase in parameter and operator counts deepens
the circuit which leads to decrease the chemical accuracy in ground state molecular energies. Morever, these operators may
not be ordered in practice and could further decrease the precision. Attempts for keeping ordered operators have been recently
proposed. 35,38,41,71

UCCGSD and k-UpCCGSD ansatze

2.3.2
UCCGSD:
Unitary Coupled Cluster Generalized Single and Double has been mentioned ﬁrst in Ref. 48, then latter described in Reference 49
for using it in quantum computing applications. It consists in excitations that occur from occupied to occupied, occupied to
unoccupied as is expressed in Eq .10, or unoccupied to unoccupied levels:

k-UpCCGSD:
𝑘-UpCCGSD denotes Unitary Pair Couple Cluster with Generalized Single and Double Product 49, where 𝑘 denotes the products
of unitary paired generalized double excitations, along with the full set of generalized single excitations. In other words, in
𝑘-UpCCGSD, single excitation operators are fully generalized without any speciﬁc constraint on the choice of occupied and
virtual orbitals, but the double excitation operators are generalized and restricted to transitions of pair electrons acting on the
same orbital:

It was recently demonstrated 49,72 that the UCCGSD ansatz leads to more accurate results for ground state energies than the
simpler UCCSD. In the same work, it was shown that starting from 𝑘 = 3 (i.e 3-UpCCGSD) brings better accuracy than UCCSD
molecule using 6-31G basis set). Indeed, such approaches were also engineered not only
ansatz (see for example table 4 for H

8

for ground states but also to tackle excited states without undesired spin symmetry crossing over to lower states during VQE
optimizations. They have been also used in connection with the variational Quantum Deﬂation algorithm (VQD), that is used
to determine the energies of the ground and excited states 73.

Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter-VQE (ADAPT-VQE)

2.4
Instead of a ﬁxed-length ansatze, other types of iterative variational algorithms have been proposed by the community 74,75,76,77,78
There are two reasons for that: (1) the ﬁxed-length ansatze use unnecessarily excitations that can be considered as redundant
terms as they do not contribute to approximate the FCI wavefunction. This creates longer circuit depth and consumes a greater
number of variational parameters; (2) ﬁxed-length ansatze such as UCCSD or QUCCSD cannot provide a good chemical accu-
racy for strongly correlated systems 51 (i.e. see for example the H
molecule in section 5). This problem occurs at long bond
lengths and could be solved by including higher-order excitations and/or using multiple-step Trotterization in the UCCSD or
QUCCSD ansatz. Yet, both of these suggestions are problematic since they would necessarily deepen the circuits and increase
the number of variational parameters. Fixed-length ansatze like 3-UpCCGSD (or k>3) and UCCGSD might also provide very
good accuracy at these bond lengths, because excitations considered are general. However, this yield many redundant terms dur-
ing optimization, and as the system size increases, the number of operators and parameters increase as well as the circuit depth.
The ADAPT-VQE approach is an important step toward solving these issues 41,50.

6

The ADAPT-VQE algorithm constructs the molecular system’s wavefunction dynamically and can in principle avoid redun-
dant terms. It is grown iteratively in the form of disentangled UCC ansatz as given in Eq. (14). At each step, an operator or a few
operators are chosen from a pool: the operator(s) contributing to the largest energy deviations is (are) chosen and added gradu-
ally to the ansatz until the exact FCI wavefunction has been reached (see below in subsubsection 2.4.1 steps of the algorithm).
This process allows reaching this goal faster than the UCC-family ansatze. For example, within the normal UCCSD-VQE, we
would need several trotterization steps to reach a certain chemical accuracy to ﬁnd the exact FCI. Conversely, with the ADAPT-
VQE algorithm and to obtain the same level of accuracy, the ansatz requests fewer variational parameters, and a correspondingly
shallower circuit containing a smaller number of gates.

The FCI wave function approximated within arbitrary accuracy from ADAPT-VQE is given by

which is in the form of a long product of one- ̂𝐴𝑝,𝑞
general operators generated from the pool of excitations,
where each of the variational parameters {𝜃𝑝𝑞, 𝜃𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑠} is associated to an operator. Historically, fermionic ADAPT-VQE 41 was
the ﬁrst algorithm in the family of adaptive ansatze. The name “fermionic” comes from the excitation pool operators formed as
spin-complement pairs of single and double fermionic evolutions (see Eqs. A1 and A2). The fermionic ADAPT-VQE has been
molecules (as shown in ﬁgure 2 of 41
shown to bring accurate chemical results for several molecules such as for H
4
by using an ansatz constituted of fewer parameters and shorter circuit depth than for the corresponding UCCSD results.
Further work has been focused on proposing qubit ADAPT-VQE 50,52, as the motivation was toward reducing the circuit gates
more eﬃciently than with fermionic ADAPT-VQE. In the fermionic case, each fermionic operator transfers into eight-Pauli
strings (after JW transformation) including their Hermitian conjugates. When we want to map the exponential for each of these
Pauli-strings into circuits, using the CNOT staircase method, the Pauli strings correspond to "single" fermionic excitations will
request 4 CNOT staircase and those of double" fermionic excitations will request 16 CNOT staircase. In qubit ADAPT-VQE,
the pool used is a collection of anti-Hermitian operators where each operator consists of a string that contains a tensor product of
Pauli matrices. In qubit ADAPT-VQE each string is transpiled into a deﬁned number of CNOT gates using the CNOT staircase
method, but unlike the fermionic ADAPT-VQE, the qubit ADAPT-VQE produces a smaller number of gates at the end of the
process. Qubit ADAPT-VQE has been tested for several molecules 50, showing that the circuit is shallower- the number of gates
being reduced by one order of magnitude compared to fermionic ADAPT-VQE. However qubit ADAPT-VQE requests a higher
number of parameters and iterations in order to reach a certain level of chemical accuracy.
The cost of fermionic- and qubit-ADAPT-VQE is the number of measurements needed to compute the energy gradients. It scales
as 𝑂(𝑛8) 41,50 (where 𝑛 represents the number of qubits). The choice of pool in qubit ADAPT-VQE has also been important
in the research to reach and approximate the FCI wavefunction, with a view to not only reduce the circuit depth compared to
fermionic ADAPT-VQE but also to minimize the number of operators in the pool without losing the completeness properties
of operators. Reducing the pool size from (𝑛4) into 2𝑛 − 2 operators and maintaining the necessary and suﬃcient conditions

HAIDAR ET AL

9

for completeness has been achieved in a recent work 52. This new scale of pool size reduces the number of measurements from
𝑂(𝑛8) to 𝑂(𝑛5) for a given molecular system. In the same reference, it was shown that incorporating symmetries into the pool
solves the convergence problems caused by the lack of symmetries.

Implementing fermionic or qubit ADAPT-VQE algorithms

2.4.1
Here we describe the procedure to implement the fermionic or qubit-ADAPT-VQE. The ﬁrst three steps present the essential
components for implementing the algorithm and the rest of steps describes the iterative loop in ADAPT-VQE:

1) In the ADAPT-VQE, the computation of one-body and two-body integrals is performed with a chemistry package such as
pySCF. This allows one to write the Hamiltonian in the second-quantization form given by Eq. 2. This Hamiltonian is transformed
into a qubit representation by using a spin transformation (see section 2.1, Eq. 4).

2) One has to deﬁne a pool of operators of size 𝑚. We can have two types of pools, the ﬁrst is of fermionic nature and the
second is related to qubits, depending on the ADAPT-VQE variant used. Within a fermionic ADAPT approach, the pool is
deﬁned as 𝐹𝑚 = {𝐹𝑚(𝑝, 𝑞), 𝐹𝑚(𝑝, 𝑞, 𝑟, 𝑠)} and consists of one- 𝐹𝑚(𝑝, 𝑞) and two-𝐹𝑚(𝑝, 𝑞, 𝑟, 𝑠)- body unitary generalised fermionic
excitations. 𝐹𝑚
are considered as the set of all unique spin-complemented one- and two-body operators, as they are given in eqs.
A1 and A2. In the qubit ADAPT case, the pool is deﬁned as single and double qubit evolutions, 𝑄𝑚 = {𝑄𝑚(𝑝, 𝑞), 𝑄𝑚(𝑝, 𝑞, 𝑟, 𝑠)}
(for more details about the nature of these operators, one can refer to subsubsection. 5.3.3).

3) A reference Hartree-Fock

state needs to be chosen in the qubit representation that preserves the number of electrons
of the system. At this stage, it is then possible to construct the ansatz by starting the ADAPT-VQE-iteration at 𝑘 = 1. The ansatz
is initialized by the identity 𝑈 (0)(𝜃) = 𝐼 and then it is actually represented by the HF state. Then the loop starts (by a "while
loop" until exit) of the ADAPTIVE wavefunction as follows.

|𝜓𝐻𝐹 ⟩

4) Then the trial state with the current ansatz on the quantum simulator

from the previous VQE-iteration, has to be prepared.

⟩ = 𝑈 𝑘−1 (𝜃𝑘−1

)

5) In order to obtain the energy gradient, the commutator has to be measured between the Hamiltonian 𝐻 and each of the
and the

operators in the pool. For the fermionic ADAPT-VQE case, the exponential for each of unitary fermionic operator in 𝐹𝑚
gradient is the derivative of energy over 𝜃𝑘−1

ALGORITHMS FOR QUANTUM CHEMISTRY ON THE ATOS QUANTUM LEARNING

3
MACHINE

In this section, we brieﬂy review the tools of the Atos Quantum Learning Machine (QLM) that are relevant for quantum chemistry
computations. We will then, in the next section (sec. 4), describe how we build an advanced chemistry module upon these tools.

A quantum programming environment and a powerful simulator

3.1
QLM is a complete environment designed for quantum software programmers, engineers and researchers 79. It includes a wide
variety of low-level tools useful for writing, compiling and optimizing quantum circuits 80,81,82,83,84. These tools come in the
form of so-called "plugins" that can be combined or stacked upon another to construct a quantum compilation chain.

FIGURE 1 QLM workﬂow for quantum chemistry. Top row: Steps to prepare a variational quantum job containing a parame-
terized circuit and the Hamiltonian whose ground state energy one wants to approximate. The leftmost (grey) box uses standard
third-party quantum chemistry modules. Orange boxes stand for QLM libraries. Bottom row: QLM stack, with plugins (orange
boxes) that pre- and post-process the job and results, and a QPU (green box) that executes the quantum job and returns a result.

QLM can simulate quantum circuits in a noiseless or noisy fashion. The noiseless simulators come in diﬀerent ﬂavors, with
"Schrödinger style" simulators (storing the wavefunction either in a dense fashion or using Matrix Product States 85), a "Feynman-
style" simulator 86, a binary decision diagram simulator 87, a Cliﬀord simulator, etc. The Schrödinger-style dense simulator can
reach up to 41 qubits for any circuit, while the other simulators can reach much larger qubit counts depending on the circuit
properties (entanglement, gateset, etc). The noisy simulators enable the emulation of realistic quantum noise, a crucial tool in
the current NISQ era. Gate noise, State Preparation and Measurement (SPAM) noise and idling noise can be taken into account
via density-matrix (resp. stochastic) simulations that can handle circuit with up to 20 (resp. 40) qubits. Most importantly, the
interface of the simulators (also called "Quantum Processing Units" or QPUs) is such that they can easily be swapped for
actual experimental QPUs without modifying the quantum program. QLM provides an interface to various hardware processors
including those constructed by IBM and Rigetti. Its circuits are also interoperable 44 with other quantum circuit descriptions like
Qiskit 45, Cirq 46 and PyQuil 47, as described in more detail in Appendix B. Moreover, QLM comes with quantum application

libraries that enable the easy exploration of potential use cases of quantum computing. These libraries help generate quantum
programs in ﬁelds ranging from combinatorial optimization to quantum chemistry and condensed-matter physics.

A summary of the QLM workﬂow for quantum chemistry is provided in ﬁgure 1 . The top row represents the steps one has
to go through to handle a quantum chemistry problem using myQLM-fermion (bracketed terms represent optional steps). At the
end of these steps, one obtains a "job" comprising a parameterized quantum circuit (that implements a UCC ansatz) 𝐶( ⃗𝜃) and
a Hamiltonian 𝐻sp
represented as a sum of Pauli terms. This job can then be fed to the QLM stack. This stack, represented in
the bottom row, can be constructed by the user at will depending on the QPU they want to execute the job on. A minimal stack
consists of a QPU (without plugins), which can handle minimal jobs containing native quantum circuits (with gates native to
the hardware and compliant with its connectivity) and 𝑍-axis observables. To handle more sophisticated jobs, one can stack
"plugins" on top of the QPU. Each plugin has a well-deﬁned role, such as compiling the circuit to a given gateset, rewriting
it to comply with a given connectivity (see "Compilation plugins"), or generating all the elementary jobs required to compute
the expectation value of a general observable (see "Observable Splitter plugin"). Finally, some plugins can handle variational
jobs corresponding to the VQE algorithm. Such "variational plugins" handle the update of the variational parameters based
on the result of the previous steps. They can optionally generate jobs to compute the gradient of a given expectation value if
gradient-based optimization is asked for.

FIGURE 2 Overview of the QLM environment. Documentation of my-QLM/myQLM-fermion is given in 43,54.

In practice, the QLM environment is composed of software modules and a powerful classical HPC hardware appliance,
as described in ﬁgure 2 . Among the software modules, some are available and downloadable for free as Python packages.
They come under the name of myQLM 43. myQLM includes modules for programming quantum circuits, with quantum libraries
(for performing e.g quantum arithmetic operations, etc), for describing quantum observables and analog quantum schedules. It
also comes with a basic noiseless simulator for quantum circuits, basic plugins (e.g for splitting observables depending on the
commutation relations of the Pauli operators), and modules for interacting with other quantum frameworks like Qiskit, Cirq, etc.
Finally, myQLM contains the aforementioned myQLM-fermion module. myQLM can be installed on a laptop or on a local cluster.
The size of the circuits that can be simulated with the QPU simulator of myQLM is limited by the available Random Access
Memory (RAM) (for a standard laptop, this corresponds to about 25 qubits). The Quantum Learning Machine is also a powerful
HPC appliance. It comes with extra software in addition to myQLM: advanced noiseless simulators, modules for describing
hardware models, noisy simulators (both gate-based and analog), advanced compilers, tomography and error mitigation modules,
among others. The appliance itself can simulate circuits with up to 41 qubits when using state vector simulators, and more when
using more speciﬁc representations of the wave function (like Matrix Product States or stabilizers). The software module we
present below, OpenVQE, relies only on myQLM modules, which means it can be used by simply downloading myQLM on one’s

personal machine. Therefore, the results shown for small qubit counts can be (up to the run times) reproduced on a personal
laptop. In practice, to execute the simulations, we used the QLM advanced noiseless statevector simulator so as to reach large
qubit counts and gain speed.

3.2 myQLM-fermion: An Open Source QLM module for fermionic many-body problems
The tools for quantum chemistry are collected into an open-source module called "myQLM-fermion", which is part of
myQLM. myQLM-fermion provides general tools for dealing with fermionic problems: representations of fermionic Hamiltoni-
ans (including usual Hamiltonians like the electronic structure Hamiltonian (Eq. (2)), the Hubbard and Anderson Hamiltonians),
transformations from fermion operators to qubit operators (Jordan-Wigner, Bravyi-Kitaev, parity), generation of quantum evo-
lution circuits via Trotterization, implementation of the quantum phase estimation algorithm, as well as various modules for
variational algorithms such as VQE (see subsection 2.1): libraries of variational ansätze (like hardware-eﬃcient ansätze, match-
gate circuits, Low-Depth Circuit ansatz (LDCA) circuits), various optimization plugins (including the standard optimizers
implemented in scipy 57 (COBYLA, BFGS, etc) as well as the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Algorithm (SPSA) and
Particle-Swarm Optimizer (PSO)).

A submodule of myQLM-fermion 54 is speciﬁcally devoted to quantum chemistry. It provides tools for selecting active spaces
(based on natural-orbital occupation numbers), generating cluster operators (and thus, via the aforementioned Trotterization
tools, UCC-type ansätze), and initial guesses for their variational parameters. The architecture of QLM and myQLM-fermion
allows for experts in a given ﬁeld to construct their own advanced modules with the QLM building blocks.

The key building block of quantum chemistry computations is the Hamiltonian, Eq. 2. On QLM, it is described by an object

ElectronicStructureHamiltonian

2 hamiltonian = E l e c t r o n i c S t r u c t u r e H a m i l t o n i a n (h , g )

where h and g are the tensors ℎ𝑝𝑞
in Eq. (9). For instance, the following snippet

and ℎ𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑠

of Eq. (2). Such an object also describes cluster operators such as the ones described

creates the list containing the sets of single excitations {𝑐†
𝑗 𝑐†
𝑐†
𝑖 𝑐𝑙𝑐𝑘, 𝑘, 𝑙 ∈ 𝑣𝑖𝑟𝑡, 𝑖, 𝑗 ∈ 𝑜𝑐𝑐}.
These objects can be readily converted to a spin (or qubit) representation using various fermion-spin transforms:

𝑖 𝑐𝑘, 𝑘 ∈ 𝑣𝑖𝑟𝑡, 𝑖 ∈ 𝑜𝑐𝑐} and double excitations {𝑐†

9 clu ster_o ps_bk = [ t r a n s f o r m _ t o _ b k _ b a s i s ( t_o ) for t_o in cluster_ops ]

The transformed objects are now in the form of Eq. (4). With these qubit operators, one can then easily contruct a simple UCCSD
ansatz via trotterization of the exponential of the parametric cluster operator deﬁned in Eq. (9):

The circuit we constructed, circ, is a variational circuit that creates a variational wavefunction
optimized to minimize the variational energy, Eq. (5). This is done by a simple VQE loop:

|𝜓(𝜃)⟩

. Its parameters can be

1 # create a quantum job containing the variational circuit and the Hamiltonian
2 job = circ . to_job ( observable = hamiltonian_jw , nbshots =0)

13

14 # submit the job and read the result
15 result = stack . submit ( job )
16

17 print ( " Minimum energy = " , result . value )

The simulated QPU used in the previous code snippet can be readily replaced by an actual QPU by using the qat-interop

module. For instance, in the following snippet, we use a transmon QPU by IBM:

1 from qat . interop . qiskit import BackendToQPU
2 qpu = get_default_qpu ()
3 qpu = BackendToQPU ( token = MY_IBM_TOKEN , ibmq_backend = " ibmq_guadalupe " )

Conversely, circuits created using other quantum programming frameworks can be converted to the QLM format. For instance,
here we convert a circuit written in the Google Cirq format to a QLM circuit (that can then be fed to a QLM simulator):

1 from qat . interop . cirq import cirq_to_qlm
2 qlm_circ = cirq_to_qlm ( your_google_circ )

THE OPENVQE PACKAGE

OpenVQE facilitates the development of new algorithms on quantum computers. It consists in a couple of new modules
that extend the main myQLM/myQLM-fermion implementations (see section 3 above). Those modules allow to build normal
UCCSD algorithm, its variants and ADAPT-VQE’s algorithms as reviewed in section 2. To explain in another fashion, Open-
VQE allows to perform calculations using new types of UCC methods that are diﬀerent from the QLM predeﬁned ones such as
the regular UCCSD ansatz.

OpenVQE consists of two main modules which are inside "openvqe" folder given as follows:

• UCC Family denoted in code by "ucc_family": this module includes diﬀerent classes and functions to generate the
fermionic cluster operators (fermionic pool) and the qubit pools, and to get the VQE optimized energies in the cases of
active and non-active orbital selections.

• ADAPT denoted by "adapt": it includes two sub-modules which are:

– Fermionic-ADAPT: containing functions performing the fermionic ADAPT-VQE algorithmic steps in the active

and non-active space selections.

– Qubit-ADAPT: containing functions that perform the qubit ADAPT-VQE algorithmic steps calculation in the active

and non-active space orbital selections.

Additionally "openvqe" contains a subfolder named "common_ﬁles" that stores all the internal functions needed to be imported
for executing the two modules. OpenVQE consists also a "notebooks" folder that allows the user to run and test the above two
modules which are theoretically described in the review section 2. In our GitHub website 53 we describe the package and the codes
allowing for performing these modules. The brief sketch of OpenVQE implementation is explained in the ﬂow chart presented
in ﬁgure 3 . We remind the reader that we will describe below the code of OpenVQE that studies the full space selections
and the codes which are related to active space selections can be found in the GitHub website 53 inside "notebooks" with preﬁx
"active_space" and the tools provided in documentation of 54 . In order to develop a new algorithm using our OpenVQE package,

it is important to list the diﬀerent parameters and return variables contained in its main functions. In what follows we describe
the snippets python codes which are written in the "notebooks" folder. Then, we describe the snippet codes related to some
internal functions related to "ucc_family" and "adapt", respectively.
The ﬁrst crucial parameters are the ones specifying the characteristics of the molecules such as symbol of the molecule; the
type of excitation generator, which are generators to produce the excitations that found in sec. 2.3: UCCSD (Eq. 9), QUCCSD
(Eq. 11), UCCGSD (Eq. 12), K-UpCCGSD (Eq. 13) and spin-complemented pair (Eq. A1 and Eq. A2); the spin transformation
mapping (JW, Bravi-Kitaev, parity basis), choice of active or non-active space selection, denoted respectively in our code as
molecule_symbol, type_of_generator, transform, and active.

The user speciﬁes these parameters in a class called MoleculeFactory. This class takes those parameters as input:

In addition to that, we deﬁne another function named as generate_cluster_ops() that takes as input the name of excitation

allows generate_cluster_ops() to return as output the size of pool excitations, fermionic operators, and JW transformed

Once these are generated, we import them as input to the UCC-family and ADAPT modules.
In the UCC module, we have two types of pools: fermionic pool and qubit pool. For the fermionic case, it is determined by
the generate_cluster_ops() function which is deﬁned before. For the qubit pool, we deﬁned a QubitPool class that deter-
mines the qubit cluster operators we name as returned_pool. Due to the variety of choices of qubit pools, we created two
functions in the QubitPool class. These functions are in the code deﬁned as follows: generate_pool_from_cluster() and
generate_pool_without_cluster(). The ﬁrst function takes as parameters the pool name and return the pool with its size.
The pools that are accessible for the user are as follows: full, full_without_Z and reduced_without_Z. However the function
generate_pool_without_cluster() takes as parameters the type of pool, pool generated from cluster operators and returns
the pool with its size. The type of pool that are considered as options for the user are as follows (subsubsection 5.3.3 describes
the nature of these pools): YXXX, XYXX, XXYX, XXXY, random, two, four, symmetry.

1 from openvqe . common_files . qubit_pool import QubitPool
2 # number of qubits :
3 nbqbits = hamiltonian_jw . nbqbits
4 # suppose user selects the pool_condition = ’ full_without_Z ’ then :
5 pool_size , returned_pool = QubitPool . g e n e r a t e _ p o o l _ f r o m _ c l u s t e r ( pool_condition , cluster_ops , nbqbits )
6 # Pools are related
7 pool_type = ’ two ’
8 # for some pools such as pool_type = ’ symmetry ’, we need to import the molecule_symbol in the function
9 pool_size , returned_pool = QubitPool . g e n e r a t e _ p o o l _ w i t h o u t _ c l u s t e r ( pool_type = pool_type ,

to qubit cluster operators suppose user selects pool_type = ’ two ’ then :

nbqbits = nbqbits ,

qubit_pool = cluster_ops_jw , molecule_symbol = ’ H2O ’)

We also provide other functions that can be used by the user (e.g., qubit_excitations()) which could be used for performing
other type of VQE algorithms such as for QEB-VQE developed by Yordan et al. 69). Once the fermionic or qubit pool is generated,
we call the get_energies() from the EnergyUCC class in order to obtain the minimal energy calculated with the basic VQE
algorithm.

In the fermionic ADAPT sub-module, we call the function fermionic_adapt_vqe() that takes as parameters the fermionic
cluster operators, spin Hamiltonian, maximum number of gradients to be taken per iteration, the type of optimizer, tolerance,
threshold of norm (𝜖) and the maximum number of adaptive iterations:

fermionic_adapt_vqe() calls internally other functions allowing the execution of the steps from 4th to 7th given in subsection
2.4: (1) prepare the trial state through prepare_state(); (2) compute analytically the commutator between the hamiltonian
and the fermionic operator through compute_gradient(); (3) collect and arrange the gradients in a list from maximum to
minimum (with avoiding the zeros) through sorted_gradient(); (4) if the norm is less than the (𝜖), the program exits returning

3We use the function count() from OpenVQE to evaluate the gates from the ﬁnal optimized circuit, among which are the CNOT gates. We count them with the following
based condition: If the optimized parameter associated with the full cluster operator cluster_ops_jw is less than a certain threshold equal to 10−7, we omit it from the list,
which means that the suppressed operators will not be included in the mapping into circuit, and thus the CNOT gates coming from the suppressed operators are not counted.

the generated values, else it will continue calculating the maximum gradient(s) of operator(s) depending on the number of
maximum gradient in the input, after that, we append the operator(s) associated with their parameter(s) to the left of the previous
trial state (step (1)) during which we apply VQE using function ucc_action(), which is described above in order to optimize
the parameter(s) until satisfying the threshold’s condition; This function returns: (i) the number of classical parameters for the
ﬁnal ansatz, (ii) the number of CNOT gates in the ansatz circuit, (iii) number of other gates, (iv) list of optimized energies
corresponding to external iterations and (v) energy subtracted from the full conﬁguration interaction (FCI).
The qubit ADAPT sub-module is globally similar to the fermionic ADAPT in terms of the code structure, some key steps are
diﬀerent and makes it unique in its nature. Those steps can be summarized in the following sequence: (i) we use qubit pool
generators (using QubitPool) instead of fermionic ones; (ii) the preparation of the trial state is diﬀerent from the fermionic
Adapt one; (iii) the gradients calculation is not the same. It returns the same properties as that of fermionic ADAPT-VQE.

SYSTEMATIC BENCHMARKING OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VERSIONS OF
5
UCC AND ADAPT-VQE ON SEVERAL MOLECULES USING THE OPENVQE PACKAGE

In this section, we performed numerical estimations of ground state energies by means of OpenVQE, more speciﬁcally, by using
the VQE-UCC-family and ADAPT-VQE modules. This was done for a range of molecules which require from 4 to 24 qubits to
be treatable with quantum computing (see Figure 4 ). We perform only noiseless simulations in order to minimize computational
runtime and all simulations were performed on TotalEnergies in-house HPC architecture4. We validate our results by comparing
some of them with other works obtained with similar methodologies.

For each numerical simulation in the UCC-family or ADAPT-VQE modules, we use the following common functions imple-
mented in OpenVQE to calculate: (i) the molecular orbital integrals using the PYSCF package with the STO-3G, 6-31G and
cc-pVDZ basis sets; (ii) the molecular Hamiltonian mapping which is obtained by applying the Jordan-Wigner transformation;
(iii) the circuits simulated which are based on the CNOT staircase method, except for QUCCSD version for which we use the two
circuits which represent the single and double qubit evolutions (see Figure 1 and 2 in 69, respectively). We used the scipy.optimize
library for optimization.

We organize the presentation of our work on molecular simulations using OpenVQE into three main subsections: (i) subsection
5.1 that displays the timings of the QLM simulator for constructing the UCCSD ansatz on a simulator as well as for obtaining
the expectation value of the electronic structure Hamiltonian for a set of molecules (STO-3G basis set) ranging from 4 to 24
qubits. (ii) subsection 5.2, dedicated to the UCC-family module, it describes the performance of UCCSD-VQE for H
with the
6
STO-3G basis set and for LiH using 6-31G basis set with diﬀerent sizes of active spaces. Then we focus on H
at a single
6
geometrical arrangement to show how close do diﬀerent optimizers come to the chemical accuracy5 and how many CNOT gates
they require to achieve such an accuracy. We also discuss diﬀerent ways of choosing the initial wavefunction such as the random
guess and Møller-Plesset wavefunction in second order. Secondly we extend our calculations to a larger set of molecules and all
considered using the STO-3G basis set. Some computations use a full space and some others include active space selections, in
order to compare the chemical accuracy obtained from three diﬀerent UCCSD: regular UCCSD, UCCSD without the Z-Pauli
terms and QUCCSD ansatze. We then compare the results with those obtained from CCSD, CCSD(T), CISD and CIPSI classical
methods. Since CIPSI is not a common known method unlike the other three methods, we brieﬂy introduce its deﬁnition as
follows: the Conﬁguration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively (CIPSI) wave-function is a truncation of
the Full Conﬁguration Interaction (FCI) wave-function where the determinant are selected regarding a perturbative selection.
The method has been developed since a few decades (see some references in the introduction of 88) and it is well described
in 89,90; (iii) subsection 5.3 that uses the ADAPT-VQE module. It describes the comparison between the fermionic and qubit
ADAPT-VQEs in terms of chemical accuracy by benchmarking the three molecules H
, in the STO-3G orbital
basis set by assuming a full space selection approximation in each molecule. All CNOT number estimations are obtained using
the CNOT staircase circuits. Then, using the fermionic ADAPT-VQE sub-module, we simulated several other molecules using
a larger number of qubits and diﬀerent basis sets assuming full space selection. Such computations were performed in order to
demonstrate the capacity of our sub-module code functions to perform larger calculations and to reach chemical accuracy despite

5For a given basis set, according to Wikipedia, the standard chemical accuracy is 1 kcal/mol which is around 1.59 × 10−3 Hartree. This accuracy represents the error

diﬀerence between the predicted energy and FCI energy. We use this value as a standard reference in all our results.

the increase of the molecule sizes. Using the same sub-module we also tested several molecules with active space selections to
compare the eﬃciency of fermionic ADAPT-VQE in the context of such active space approximations.

Next we describe how the Qubit-ADAPT-VQE sub-module works through choosing diﬀerent types of qubit pools, each with
a diﬀerent size. To do so, we study the H
molecule using STO-3G basis set. Finally we introduce a brief Table summarizing the
4
comparison of UCC-family methods involving the fermionic excitations (UCCSD and UCCGSD) and fermionic ADAPT-VQE
method in several molecules in terms of number of parameters, CNOT counts, chemical accuracy, and computational time.

Simple UCCSD ansatz: Representative computational performances with OpenVQE
5.1
To illustrate the performances of our OpenVQE package on CPUs, we chose to use a standard laptop6 to evaluate the time
to solution required to perform two operations that are common to most of the variational algorithms: (i) the application of
the ansatz; (ii) the computation of the expectation value of a molecular Hamiltonian or another observable. Examples of such
operations are: the implementing of a Hardware eﬃcient circuit ansatz, or a unitary coupled cluster ansatz; Observables are for
example the electronic structure Hamiltonian, a commutator operator, Pauli string terms etc, which can be applied by either of
these ansatze to measure their expectation value. As a test, we chose here the UCCSD method to evaluate the timing associated
to various computations. It is important to note that, in practice, for the particular case of the simple UCCSD, OpenVQE and
the native QLM timings are identical, where QLM simulator used is from QLM version 1.2.1. To measure such timings, we
conducted benchmarks with a set of molecules using OpenVQE in the STO-3G basis set (H
, CO,
HCN, and C
). Figure 4 (a) displays the timings associated to the generation of a state-vector corresponding to the UCCSD
2
ansatz (see Eq. 10) from OpenVQE. The computational cost for this generation grows sub-exponentially with the number of
qubits. We observe that the package can compute the UCCSD wavefunction within less than a second for a molecule requiring 4
to 12 qubits, between a second and 10 seconds for molecules associated to a 14-20 qubits range and up to few minutes for larger
molecules (22-24 qubits). Figure 4 (b) represents the timing cost for measuring the expectation value of the JW tranformed
Hamiltonian (see Eq. 4) of each of these molecules using UCCSD ansatz. This measurement increases linearly with the number
of qubits and it is done by using the UCCSD circuit together with the "Job" class which will be submitted to QPU to obtain
the expectation value. The process is described by the code function called UCC_action() which can be found in section 4
We observe that the computational cost of performing the measurement increases exponentially with the number of qubits. In
particular, we notice that molecular systems up to 14 qubits like H
O (10 electrons) using OpenVQE, can be performed in a
2
second for a UCCSD circuit. This circuit involves 12,240 CNOT gates and 1,083 Pauli strings, as shown in Figure 4 (c). This
Figure also shows the details of the number of CNOT gates and Pauli strings associated to each molecule.

6-31g basis set, for a range of bond lengths for both molecules. For H
molecule, which has a Hilbert space spanned by 12
6
Hartree Fock orbitals, 6 occupied and 6 virtual (i.e., unoccupied) we choose two diﬀerent active spaces: (i) First 2 spin orbitals
where the lowest energies are always ﬁlled and 2 spin orbitals where the highest energies are always empty, as these 4 spin-
orbitals are not considered in the active space selection, the system consists of 8 active spin orbitals with 4 active electrons
which means 8 qubits Hamiltonian; (ii) when we consider that only the ﬁrst two spin-orbitals are always ﬁlled, the system has
then 4 active electrons and 10 spin-orbitals corresponding to 10 qubit Hamiltonian. Figure 5 (a) shows the error of ground state
energies of H
molecule at diﬀerent dissociation proﬁles, with diﬀerent sizes of the active spaces ranging from a minimum 8
6
qubits to the full space 12 qubits. This error corresponds to absolute value of VQE-UCCSD results substracted from FCI energy.
By increasing the active space from 8 to 10 qubits, we observe only few improvements of accuracy and both sizes are still far
from approaching the chemical accuracy (see the blue line which was set at 10−3 Ha). However in the full space case, the VQE
results approach the chemical accuracy before a bond length equal to 1.5 Å. Interestingly, for bond length ≥ 1.5 Å, even with
full space, the error deviates well beyond the chemical accuracy but it seems to be curving again toward the blue line beyond
can be seen
3.0 Å. This error means that triple excitations are probably required. A comparable results to our ﬁndings for H

LiH molecule. Using the 6-31G basis set, LiH has a Hilbert space spanned by 22 HF orbitals, 4 occupied and 18 virtual (i.e.,
unoccupied). But ﬁve active space selections are chosen, leading to 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 qubit Hamiltonians. For all choices of
active spaces here, the error decreases steadily as the the bond length increased. The 10 and 12 qubit Hamiltonians are below
the chemical accuracy for bond length > 1.0Å, while the largest deviation measured is in the intermediate bond lengths range
between 1 and 2.4 Å. Interestingly, for the 8, 10 and 12 qubits results fall within a narrow range, at bond length before 1.0
and at bond length beyond 2.2Å. Surprisingly, we noticed some jumps in the accuracy for the three cases 6, 8 and 10 qubits at
some bond lengths, for example around 2.2Å. A similar analysis has been made in 66 for two diﬀerent molecules than ours, by

Inﬂuence of the optimization method in the UCCSD-VQE performance for H6 at r=1.0 Å

5.2.2
After showing the performance of UCCSD-VQE in terms of active space selection and MP2 pre-screening approaches, we
show the beneﬁts that OpenVQE can bring through active space selection (see Figure 5 ). Indeed, such a technique allows to
approach a similar accuracy as those reached by using a full space at certain bond lengths, even with a smaller number of qubits.
Furthermore, in order to test for the usefulness of using MP2 guesses in VQE-UCC algorithm, we choose the H
molecule
6
associated to the STO-3G basis set at a bond length of 𝑟 = 1.0Å using a full space. We calculated UCCSD-VQE energies
using six diﬀerent optimizers, namely COBYLA, BFGS, SLSQP, CG, Powell and Nelder-Mead and with three diﬀerent initial
guesses: (i) random, where random values are chosen uniformly in the interval [0.0, 1.0]; (ii) ﬁxed-value of 0.001; (iii) MP2
guesses. In Figure 6 we compare the eﬀects of these initial guesses on the VQE optimization based on three criteria: (i) the
number of function evaluations required for convergence in Figure 6 (a); (ii) the error of energy corresponding to VQE energy
subtracted from the FCI energy solution in Figure 6 (b); (iii) the number of CNOT gates needed for completing a circuit after
ﬁnal optimization in Figure 6 (c). From Figure 6 (a) we observe that the CO YLA and Nelder-Mead methods require a high
number of function evaluation (> 30000) for VQE performance when the parameters are chosen randomly. Conversely, the other
optimizers (BFGS, SLSQP, CG and Powell) requirements appear smaller number with less function evaluations (about 3000 up
to 10000) until reaching convergence. In practice, Nelder-Mead is clearly not adapted to this case where it exhibits high energy
errors beyond 0.1 Ha, as shown in Figure 6 (b). The COBYLA method brings better accuracy than SLSQP, which nevertheless
needs a smaller number of function evaluations. COBYLA is known to have a better ability to explore the energy than SLSQP.
The other optimizers BFGS, CG and Powell bring comparable results between 10−1 and 10−2 Ha. On the other hand, for the
0.001 ﬁxed-value and MP2 initial guesses methods- COBYLA, BFGS, SLSQP, CG and Powell converge well to almost the same
minimum of accuracy, which is under than 10−3 Ha.

In general, the number of evaluation changes depending on the type of the optimizer: some optimizers require the estimation
of the gradients (BFGS, SLSQP and CG) and some belong to the class of gradient-free optimizers (COBYLA, Powell, Nealder-
Mead). From Figure 6 (a) it is clear that gradient-based optimizers (BFGS, SLSQP and CG) require less function evaluations
as compared to gradient-free ones (COBYLA, Powell, Nealder-Mead). This is true for every optimizer and choice of initial
parameters except for ”random" where the Powell optimizer requires less function evaluations as compared to SLSQP and

BFGS. We hypothesise that this behaviour is due to the fact that the random guess of the initial parameters was closer to the
optimum in the case when Powell optimizer was used. However, this advantage in using gradient-based as opposed to gradient-
free optimizers might not remain when executing algorithms on actual hardware where shot noise, relaxation and dephasing
somewhat randomize the optimization landscape, making the estimation of gradients, especially ﬁne ones, more challenging.
The energy error follows a somewhat similar trend (subﬁgure (b). Figure 6 (c) shows that by using count() function found in
OpenVQE package, MP2 guesses lead to reduce the CNOT gates in the ﬁnal circuit when using BFGS, SLSQP, CG and Powell
methods. The CNOT gates are reduced by about a half compared to COBYLA or Nelder-Mead. Moreover MP2 guess shows
better reductions in CNOT gates when compared to random or 0.001 ﬁxed-value guesses. Similar analysis and comparisons
between diﬀerent optimizers and initial guesses showing the importance of using MP2 guess is studied for H
molecule, there
4
not only linear geometry path has been tested but also rectangular and trapezoidal paths 35, showing that when MP2 guess is
used, a smaller number of function evaluations is required, regardless which path of geometry is considered.

randomly from interval [0.0, 1.0]). (Random), all parameters were ﬁxed at 0.001 (0.001) and used MP2 amplitudes (MP2). We
compare the number of function evaluations required for convergence (Final accuracy in the optimization set as 10−4) (panel (a)),
the error in the ﬁnal energy with respect to the FCI energy (panel (b)), the number of CNOT gates after optimization (panel(c)).
The scale of function evaluations is truncated at 30000 to enable comparisons. We remind also that we choose a tolerance of
10−7. In practice, if the parameters values appear below this condition then the operators associated to these parameters are
omitted from the ﬁnal UCCSD wave function.

Estimation of UCCSD and QUCCSD accuracies compared to classical methods and of the

5.2.3
required quantum resources for a range of molecules in STO-3G basis set
Following our previous discussion, we used the UCCSD and QUCCSD methods to build ansatze and MP2 initial as guesses.
UCCSD and QUCCSD circuits are implemented in OpenVQE based on the CNOT staircase method and so are QUCCSD cir-
cuits while we are using the eﬃcient circuits introduced in 69. The optimization is performed with the BFGS algorithm as the
maximum number of function evaluations was ﬁxed at 50,000. To compare the resulting UCCSD and QUCCSD energies we cal-
culated the ground state energies of the same molecules using the following four classical methods: CCSD, CCSD(T), CISD and
CIPSI. The ﬁrst three methods were carried out by using the Gaussian software package 92, while CIPSI was carried out by using
the Quantum Package (QP) 93. We also computed the FCI (for STO-3G) energy using the functions implemented in the QLM
library based on PYSCF package. We choose the following set of molecules, H
O whose geometries
4
are near equilibrium and are detailed in the MoleculeFactory class in (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) format in OpenVQE. We choose other larger
size molecules CH
, which we also present in the same format in MoleculeFactory. We
took the geometries of these near equilibrium larger molecules from the NIST Diatomic Spectral Database 94,95,96,97. All these
molecules we consider have a singlet spin ground state. Moreover we consider all these molecules using full space selections
when we apply the three methods: CCSD, CCSD(T) and CISD. However, it is not the case when we calculate UCCSD- and

values are obtained taking the absolute values of the substraction of the UCCSD and QUCCSD estimated energy from the cor-
responding FCI energy. As is seen in Figure 7 (a) Comparing ansatz performance of UCCSD to QUCCSD, we observe diﬀerent
and LiH), the QUCCD achieves the same level of accu-
cases for molecules in case of full space selections: (i) in molecules (H
O) there is a diﬀerence in the error where QUCCSD performs
racy compared to the UCCSD; (ii) in molecules (H
and H
worse compared to UCCSD, moreover, QUCCSD is still around the chemical accuracy level on these three molecules. In H
,
8
the error increased by around one order of magnitude (i.e from 10−3 up to 10−2 Ha) and is above the chemical accuracy. The
reason for these error changes is that the QUCCSD ansatze fail to recover the correlation eﬀects that become stronger at certain
bond lengths especially when the system qubit size increases (i.e. like for the 20 qubits H
system). Now for molecules within
8
the active space selection, the QUCCSD ansatz performs as accurately as UCCSD. This means that within this size of qubits,
the removal of parity terms in excitation operators may not aﬀect accuracy of the QUCCSD method compared to UCCSD. This
is consistent with previous results obtained in reference 51 where the accuracy reached by QUCCSD was found comparable to
that obtained with UCCSD for a test set of molecules including H
at similar bond lengths. Such data
4
tend to show that despite the sole inclusion of single and double excitations, QUCCSD can approximate electronic wavefunc-
tion almost as accurately as UCCSD while not being as reliable. It can be particularly noticed in the cases of strongly correlated
systems within full space (H

Figure 7 (b) displays a comparison between the CCSD, CCSD(T), CISD and CIPSI classical methods, it appears that CIPSI
results bring the most accurate results for all the molecules presented and by at least one order of magnitude from CCSD(T).
Comparing UCCSD-VQE Figure 7 (a) to the classical methods in Figure 7 (b), we ﬁnd similar order of magnitude for CCSD
and better than CISD, for molecules (H
O). Within these molecules CCSD(T) is better. For molecules
and H
2
calculated within active space selection, we clearly ﬁnd that classical methods, mainly CCSD(T) and CIPSI, bring better accu-
racy, due to the fact that core orbitals are not frozen in these cases. Interestingly, some molecules like C
as
2
is seen in Figure 7 (a) still approach the accuracy of classical methods mainly CISD and CCSD. However CISD and CCSD
are also far from the chemical accuracy which CCSD(T) does. This shows that apart from active space selection approach, the
triple excitations for large molecules is required to perform UCCSD(T) or even the UCCSDT(Q). These observed results show
that despite the fact that the unitary coupled cluster works very well within active space selection for some molecules, this is
not deﬁnitive. The results could probably be improved with more qubits/larger active space selection and/or adding triple exci-
tations. A future work will provide enhanced accuracy by improving the QLM simulator (increasing the number of qubits). It is
worth pointing out that an analysis for some molecules comparing the classical methods to UCCSD was previously studied in
references. 98,99

In Figure 8 , we roughly estimate the number of CNOT gates from UCCSD and QUCCSD ansatz for all the molecules listed
above. We are interested in counting these gates because they are now the most critical required recodesources in the NISQ
devices. Using our code function to count CNOT gates, we obtained very good count reduction. For example, for LiH, the
number of CNOT gates went from 6976 to 4720 with UCCSD ansatz (before and after the initial MP2 guess and subsequent
molecule, from 18208 to 6368 with UCCSD (before and after the
optimization) and to (1112) with QUCCSD ansatz. For BeH

count is reduced by around one-half between UCCSD and QUCCSD ansatze.
Furthermore, for some other molecules within the active space selection approximation such as C

the ﬁnal CNOT counts with UCCSD and QUCCSD are about the same. We can conclude that QUCCSD exhibits lower gate

Two implementations of fermionic ADAPT-VQE and qubit ADAPT-VQE

In Figure 9 , we represent the energy convergence for LiH, H
ADAPT-VQE approaches. The three molecules are at bond lengths 𝑟Li-H= 1.45Å, 𝑟H-H = 0.85Å, and H
at bond distance 𝑟H-H =
6
1.0 Å, respectively. All convergence plots are terminated when the norm value is below the threshold 𝜖 (see Eq. 17 in section 2.4),
which is between 10−3 and 10−4 for fermionic ADAPT-VQE, and between 10−3 and 10−6 for qubit ADAPT-VQE, depending on
the molecule. Since we ﬁnd SLSQP and BFGS optimizers behave comparably for energy convergence (after using MP2 initial
guess) as is noticed in Figure 6 , we used SLSQP optimizer for fermionic ADAPT-VQE and the BFGS optimizer for qubit
ADAPT-VQE. The plots in Figure 9 present the two protocols in terms of two important conditions, required to construct an
ansatz and to achieve a speciﬁc chemical accuracy : (i) the number of iterations (or parameters); (ii) the number of CNOT gates.
Figures 9 (a,b,c)- show that the fermionic ADAPT-VQE converges faster than the qubit ADAPT-VQE, requiring systematically
fewer number of iterations and thus variational parameters. However as is shown in Figures 9 (d,e,f)- the CNOT counts from the
fermionic ADAPT-VQE to reach convergence, are higher by more than one-order of magnitude with respect to qubit-ADAPT-
VQE to complete a circuit at a certain level of accuracy for each molecule. Such results make sense with the fermionic ADAPT-
VQE approach since the type of operators is spin-complemented pairs (see eqs. A1 and A2). Indeed, the JW transformation
of single and double operators will lead to sets of two and eight Pauli strings, respectively, where each Pauli string is a tensor
product of Pauli matrices. According to theory, there are four CNOT staircases (for a single excitation) and sixteen (for a double
excitation) 68. The qubit ADAPT-VQE theory (see section 2.4) states that the pool consists of many individual Pauli strings. This
means the qubit ADAPT-VQE needs more ansatz elements i.e operators or parameters, to reach convergence. But at the same
time, the CNOT counts are much reduced with respect to fermionic ADAPT-VQE. Similar results of CNOT counts, number
molecules are presented in Figure 2
of parameters and chemical accuracy for fermionic ADAPT-VQE involving LiH and H
6
of 41. For LiH we match these results but for H
some diﬀerences occur since we have gone beyond the 10−3 threshold. This has
6
added more parameters to the ansatz and therefore a better accuracy. In 50 (Figure 1) results of fermionic and qubit ADAPT-VQE
involving LiH (𝑟 = 2.0Å), H
(𝑟 = 2.0Å) are also comparable to our ﬁndings but might be slightly diﬀerence

because of diﬀerent geometries in the three molecules, and threshold.

Fermionic ADAPT-VQE: simulation several molecules up to 22 qubits, in diﬀerent basis

sets, comparing active and non-active selections
In this subsection, using the fermionic ADAPT-VQE sub-module from OpenVQE, we simulate a set of molecules (from 12
qubits up to 22 qubits) without active space selections with diﬀerent basis sets. These molecules are: (i) with the STO-3G basis
set: OH− (12 qubits), HF (12 qubits), H
(20 qubits); (ii) with the
(16 qubits) and H
2
8
6-31G basis set: H
(20 qubits). The goal here is to compare both the
4
fermionic ADAPT-VQE energies of these molecules aﬀected by a 𝜖 threshold value as well and the eﬃciency of our simulator.
Figure 10 (a) shows the energy error convergence plots for the set of molecules controlled by a given value of 𝜖: (i) NH
and
H
O ( 𝜖 ≤ 10−5). We also observe
in the Figure,that for example H
(cc-pVDZ) and OH− or HF (STO-3G) exhibit a precision better than 10−8 (Ha) which is not
2
and LiH (6-31G) since the ADAPT-VQE loop stops at the given threshold (i.e. 𝜖 ≤ 10−3). We also observe from
the case for H
the same Figure that even with H
O, with the highest number of qubits (14 qubits), stopped at a threshold of 𝜖 ≤ 10−5, we
2
obtained a very good accuracy, the error being less than 10−6 Ha. It is known from the literature, that as the threshold decreases,
the chemical accuracy is improved regardless of the chosen basis set. To illustrate this point (see Figure C3 ), we represent the
molecule using the cc-pVDZ basis set, showing that controlling 𝜖 at 10−4 brings very
detailed ADAPT-VQE calculations in H
good accuracy (i.e. around 10−9 Ha) with respect to FCI(cc-pVDZ). For some molecules, we realized that some convergence
problems might appear at certain levels of accuracy from fermionic ADAPT-VQE especially when the size of molecules gets
larger while including enough number of electrons. A similar study has been done for other sets of molecules in 100 where authors
used Qiskit’s state-vector simulator. They already mentioned the diﬃculty of fermionic ADAPT-VQE method in reaching certain

convergence especially when 𝜖 gets too small i.e less than 10−4, in this paper it is suggested that choosing several maximum
gradients (like 3 or 4) at each iteration instead of one maximum gradient can improve the convergence and reduce the number
of iterations. Following this hypothesis, we are currently testing some larger molecular sizes in order to investigate how could
the number of iterations, parameters and CNOTs could reduce instead of considering only one maximum gradient per external
iteration in the ADAPT algorithm. We also tested the OpenVQE fermionic ADAPT module on a number of molecules using
O (12
active space selection. The following molecules were simulated: (i) in STO-3G, OH− (10 qubits), LiH (10 qubits), H
qubits), NH
(14 qubits; (ii) in 6-31G, LiH (20 qubits). When we ﬁxed the threshold (𝜖 ≤ 10−3), we observe in Figure 10 (b)
that even with the reduction of qubits by 2 in each molecule, the accuracy is still around and even a bit beyond the chemical
accuracy (which we assume to be 10−3 Ha). Similarly to the non-active selection case, the threshold value of fermionic ADAPT-
VQE must decrease in order to obtain better chemical accuracy. However, a good sign is that with qubit reductions, the fermionic
ADAPT-VQE algorithm remains functional. This reduced the number of operators in the pool and thus the cost of gradient
measurements. In a near future, we want to test molecules which require high numbers of qubits and to go beyond the STO-3G
, benzene etc...) using the active space selection approximation. Such benchmarks are intended to check
basis set (CO

whether the performance of fermionic ADAPT-VQE from the QLM simulator is still working eﬃciently as the molecule size
gets larger, especially with maintaining the level of accuracy.

pool could achieve a satisfying precision with fewest iterations and CNOTs counts, and a reduced computational cost in term of

and we named this qubit pool collecting 𝑄𝑚

number of Pauli strings which consequently lead to a large number of CNOTs. Possible ways to reduce the number of CNOTs
and the pool size is by omitting the 𝑍 Pauli terms from full, which we named as full_without_Z. We can further reduce the pool
by keeping the ﬁrst string acting on each combination of spin orbitals named as reduced_without_Z9. Another possibility to test
how pool size behaves is to choose one type of the following strings10 (YXXX, XYXX, XXYX, XXXY) and discarding their counter
parts11. It appears that reduced_without_Z pool is the same as 𝑌 𝑋𝑋𝑋 pool operators at least for H
but not necessarily for
4
other molecules with larger number of qubits. Randomly selecting operators from (𝑌 𝑋𝑋𝑋, 𝑋𝑌 𝑋𝑋, 𝑋𝑋𝑌 𝑋𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑌 ) and
creating a pool mix out of them is named Random. Further directions to check the chemical accuracy and the number of iterations
from qubit ADAPT-VQE ansatz is to group these Pauli strings into two or four qubit pools. We ﬁnally introduce a pool related
named symmetry, introduced in 52 (given in Eq. (11) therein). Very interesting that this pool contains the smallest number
to H
4
of operators12, complete and minimal, preserving symmetry to avoid convergence problems. To do this test on our simulator,
we use OpenVQE13 to simulate the H
molecule by applying qubit ADAPT-VQE sub-module within the diﬀerent pool size
choices described above. For optimizing the search through the hyper-parameter space of rotations of quantum gates we choose
SLSQP algorithm with the energy convergence threshold of 10−13 (Ha). Figure 11 (a) presents the energy convergence plots
with respect to FCI for each of the qubit pools. We observe that all these pools reach a chemical accuracy better than 10−8 Ha.
We also observe that Qubit pool XXYX provides an accuracy above 10−10 Ha then it loses accuracy due to convergence problems
we observed14. Other qubit pools yield an accuracy between 10−10 and around 10−12 Ha. Even though full and four pools reach
comparable accuracy as that of symmetry, we observe no convergence problems with the latter since the symmetry pool preserves
the parity symmetry, which is a property that other pools can miss. Our results are similar to that provided in 50 where some pool
reduction simulation studies are analyzed for H
and LiH molecules. Concerning the symmetry pool, a detailed analysis of this

molecule is given in Ref. 52, but researchers there have performed their calculations analytically (i.e

the exponential matrix of 𝑄𝑚
is calculated by using scipy.linalg.expm(𝑄𝑚) method). Here we use the CNOT staircase method
that map the exponential of Pauli strings found in the pool using QLM simulator. A comparison of our results in Figure 11 (a)
to Figure 3 (b) found in 52) illustrates that the QLM produces results similar as those of the analytical calculations. Figure 11
(b) shows the number of CNOT gates, the number of iterations needed to implement the ansatz and the size of each pool.

As is shown from Figure 11 (b), the symmetry pool requires higher number of CNOTs and iterations for completing an ansatz
compared with some other pools at this level of accuracy. The symmetry pool still exhibits the lowest pool size (11 operators)
which obviously helps a lot in reducing the cost of gradient energy measurements. Furthermore to construct the symmetry
pools we can follow a recent work (see 52). In this reference, H

Comparison of ﬁxed-length ansatze with ADAPT-VQE methods

5.3.4
In this subsection we want to determine how many parameters, CNOT-gates, and which energy accuracy is reached by the
"ﬁxed-length ansatze" as opposed to the fermionic ADAPT-VQE. To do so, we choose the LiH (1.45Å) and H
(1.0Å) molecules
6
as benchmarks.
In Figures 7 (a and c) and 10 (a,b,d and f) the attempt to reach chemical accuracy is displayed alongside with the number of
CNOTs for both the UCCSD and fermionic ADAPT-VQE. The UCCGSD (see Eq. 12) method remains to be characterized. We

7The singlet generalized single and double excitation operators is considered which we already used in OpenVQE.
8the individual Pauli string in any qubit pool listed here has an important property: it contains an odd number of 𝑌 s because the fermionic operators are real. To make

the ﬁnal string real, it is multiplied by an imaginary part (𝑖), however strings of even numbers of 𝑌 s cannot be considered because they don’t aﬀect the energy gradient

9YXXX strings comes always the ﬁrst, because of internal organization from QLM/myQLM libray
10In the Jordan-Wigner transformation spin-up orbitals are mapped to even-numbered states and spin-down orbitals to odd-numbered states. This means that for the
case of the single excitations (acts on qubits 𝑖 and 𝑘) we only keep the excitations that satisfy 𝑖 = 𝑘 (mod 2), where mod denotes the modulo operation. Similarly, for the
double excitations (acts on qubits 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘, 𝑙) we only keep that 𝑖 + 𝑗 = 𝑘 + 𝑙(mod 2).

11there are pairs of operators that are related by a global rotation, e.g., 𝑌0𝑋1𝑋2𝑋3

do so using the BFGS optimizer in a similar VQE loop. Table 1 and Table 2 summarize the results obtained from calculations
with each of the methods for LiH and H
, respectively. We observe from Table 1 that fermionic ADAPT-VQE brings the most

accurate values for the calculated energy by around two order of magnitudes compared with that of UCCSD and UCCGSD. A
comparable accuracy between UCCSD and ADAPT-VQE occurs when a norm threshold 10−2 is used in ADAPT-VQE (which
could be also noticed in ﬁgure 2.b of 41). This means that as the norm threshold decreases the ADAPT-VQE would bring
better accuracy. Remarkably, the number of parameters/CNOTs (30/4624) is still small compared to UCCSD and UCCGSD
eventhough the threshold considered is 10−3. Results shown in Table 2 demonstrate again that ADAPT-VQE yields the most
accurate energy for the H
molecule, by at least two orders of magnitude as compared to UCCGSD and UCCSD. Although

UCCSD requires fewer number of parameters and CNOTs than with ADAPT-VQE, the latter brings better accuracy. This is

again due to the fact that we controlled the norm threshold to 10−4. A comparable accuracy between UCCSD and ADAPT-VQE
occurs when a norm threshold 10−1 is used in ADAPT-VQE as noticed in Figure 2(h) of reference 41). It shows the fact
in H
that, at this level of threshold, ADAPT-VQE decrease the counts of CNOTs and parameters. UCCGSD energy appears in
between UCCSD and ADAPT-VQE, but the number of CNOTs and parameters remain very high.
With those results, one can deduce that ADAPT-VQE brings more accurate results than UCCSD by several order of magnitudes,
depending how the user can control the value of threshold, but the cost when using ADAPT-VQE with increased threshold is
linked to the required high number of iterations and CNOTs. These latter increase increases with the number of qubits, which
consequently leads to higher computational requirements in term of gradient computations. For UCCGSD (together with

although the UCCGSD ansatz yields very accurate results, the problem in using this method is linked to its high circuit depth.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this article, we discussed in detail our newly introduced open source package, OpenVQE. OpenVQE allows one to perform
quantum chemistry computations based on the Quantum Machine Learning (QML) thanks to the newly introduced myQLM-
fermion open source library that gather the key QLM resources that are important for quantum chemical developments. The
OpenVQE/myQLM-fermion combined quantum libraries facilitate the implementation, testing and overall development of vari-
ational quantum algorithms dedicated to quantum chemistry problems and provide state-of-the-art quantum computing methods
(see Table 3 which summarizes the GitHub links of the open-source quantum chemistry packages available to the community).
We have shown that OpenVQE enables users to construct modules in a few lines of python code using simple class structures
related to the adaptive UCC family ansatze that we reviewed in the article. We also presented how to easily implement eﬃcient
circuits related to fermionic and qubit evolutions with the goal of reducing the number of CNOT gates. Using these modules,
we generated benchmarks on a range of molecular computations from 4 to 22 qubits and obtained reliable results that appeared
consistent with those previously obtained in reference literature (see 35,98,99,70 for the UCC and 41,70,50,52 for the ADAPT-VQE
approaches). It is worth noting that technically the QLM machine is designed to simulate up to 41 Qubits on a large mem-
ory classical computer systems. OpenVQE is thus designed to simplify the researchers’ work, providing simple code modules
facilitating the construction of new algorithms and ansatze.

Furthermore, OpenVQE beneﬁts from the myQLM-fermion tools and allow to exchange/interact with other software, like
quantum chemistry-oriented quantum computing packages (see Appendix B and Figure B2 ), thus enhancing the community’s
capacity to work collectively and faster. We also intend to forge an eﬃcient module that could merge the few keys tools required
to run jobs on quantum computers such as IBM ones (as described in Appendix B. For example, Figure B1 ) show examples of
simple code structure classes that involve the interoperability between diﬀerent open source packages and QPUs.

We plan to extend further OpenVQE/myQLM-fermion tools towards reducing the quantum resources by building new mod-
ules describing functions that enable: (i) to tapper-oﬀ the number of qubits in VQE (alongside active space selection) through
using penalty functions 101, using point-group symmetry in small molecules 102 and in large molecules 103 and studying new
functions that could preserve spatial symmetry of molecules (rotational and translational); (ii) to reduce the number of CNOT
gates (alongside with MP2 guesses, eﬃcient circuits, fermionic and qubit ADAPT-VQE) through implementing other adaptive
algorithms such as permute qubit-VQE 104.

Concerning chemical accuracy, we want to implement further methods to go beyond the chemically inspired UCC ansatze
described in 36 (i.e. the implemented UCCSD, UCCGSD, spin-complement-gsd, k-UpCCGSD etc...). Equally we are interested in
other types of UCC ansatze which involve higher-order correlation eﬀects, such as MP3 or MP4, or triple excitation UCCSD(T)
which could be important for strongly correlated systems and could improve further the accuracy as mentioned earlier 49. We are
also motivated to implement additional algorithms going beyond VQE, such as VQD (ADAPT-VQD) and QITE(ADAPT-QITE)
that allow to determine excited state energies 105,72,73,106,107.

Concerning optimization eﬀects in the UCC family of methods, since we have demonstrated in the present work that some
convergence problems might appear in ADAPT-VQE when targeting certain levels of accuracy, we want to make use of more
eﬃcient optimizer methods to overcome this problem. Of course, the practical use of VQE algorithms on present quantum
computers will require to make Darwinian choices in link with qubit/operator counts and circuits depths restrictions: not all

30

algorithms will "make the cut" to the real quantum computing world. We believe that the present OpenVQE/myQLM-Fermion
approach will help the community to study and design new accurate VQE algorithmic "champions" able to eﬃciently run on
present and near-future NISQ quantum computers towards performing accurate quantum chemical computations on complex
molecular systems.

A REVIEW: SPIN-COMPLEMENT GENERALZED SINGLET AND DOUBLET EXCITATIONS

Spin-complement pair:
is a method that involves excitations that can preserve spin-symmetry for neutral closed-shell molecules (i.e number of 𝛼 elec-
trons = number of 𝛽 electrons). These excitations restrict the spin-symmetry of the UCC wavefunction Hilbert space into a
smaller Hilbert space with the desired eigenstate. In order to satisfy such spin-symmetry, only the excitations that keep balance
between 𝛼 and 𝛽 electrons should be implemented as follows:

𝜏1 = 𝑐†
𝑝𝛼

𝑐𝑞𝛼

+ 𝑐†
𝑝𝛽

𝑐𝑞𝛽

− ℎ.𝑐.

𝜏2,𝐴 = 𝑐†
𝑟𝛼
𝜏2,𝐵 = 𝑐†

This type of fermionic excitations is called spin-complemented pair: as is seen above in (Eqs. A1 and Eqs. A2), for each uni-
tary operator acting on some spin orbitals, there is an added parallel unitary operator that acts on the opposite-spin orbitals.
Spin-complemented pair excitations, have been used within the Fermionic ADAPT-VQE 41, which is used in this article when
fermionic ADAPT-VQE is implemented.

B INTEROPERABILITY OF OPEN-SOURCE PACKAGES WITH MYQLM

One of the main advantages of myQLM library as mentioned in section 3 is to allow the developers and researchers to access
through it to other quantum programming environments such as Qiskit, projectQ, pyQuil, Cirq etc. We want to shed light in this
section about the interoperability of myQLM circuit to other circuits corresponding to those packages. myQLM library provides
binders to connect with the other Python-based quantum frameworks. The role of these binders is to: (i) translate myQLM
circuits into a format deﬁned in another quantum framework and vice-versa. (ii) execute a job using a QPU deﬁned in another
quantum framework directly in myQLM and vice-versa. This is helpful to any problem in quantum computing.
When it comes to our domain of treating quantum chemistry problems using variational quantum algorithms it is important to
use myQLM tools to translate a deﬁned wavefunction represented by a QLM circuit into Qiskit, Cirq, PyQuil etc. This bridges
the gap between the chemists who work in myQLM softwares and those who work on the other packages. This allows them to
validate their calculations and their codes. This exchange between packages works easliy for the user by just using few lines of
codes developed by myQLM package.
It is interesting to realize that as we develop our VQE algorithms basing them on myQLM-fermion tools, we will certainly
need the myQLM interoperability binders to interact with the other packages. This provides tests to our developed algorithms
to compare them with those implemented in other packages.
Additionally, using this interoperability, can facilitate for the user the execution of a circuit in a real quantum device as shown in
the ﬁgure below For example to describe the QLM-Qiskit circuits switching using myQLM keys, we provide a simple example

FIGURE B1 myQLM keys: running on IBM quantum computer

related to an advanced VQE algorithm which we developed in OpenVQE described in section 4. This hopefully will make the
image of myQLM interoperability clearer to the reader. As explained in section 2.4, qubit ADAPT-VQE is based on pool of
excitations consisting of Pauli strings that can be added adaptively step by step to construct the ﬁnal ansatz. Suppose our pool
consist of the YXYY strings. Then mapping the exponential of each of these strings associated with their parameters into a circuit

HAIDAR ET AL

39

can be done typically by using CNOTstair case method. myQLM-fermion tools can help to slice this exponential to construct
this circuit, which we name it here "YXYYQLM", this construction is shown in Figure B2 . By using the keys of myQLM listed
in the same Figure, the user can switch between YXYYQLM and YXYYQiskit immediately.
We can also use other myQLM tools not only to switch QLM and Qiskit circuits but also to connect between myQLM QPU and
Qiskit Backend when we want to execute a job and obtain an estimated energy. With myQLM 44 one can simply use a circuit to
test it in a real IBM computer by doing the following few steps presented in Figure B1 : (i) First to declare your IBM token, (ii)
second to wrap a Qiskit backend in a QPU, (iii) third to use job class in order to send the circuit to a QPU then just submit the
job to IBM to obtain the results. Further details about the code documentation of these tools and binders are found in myQLM
website 43.
