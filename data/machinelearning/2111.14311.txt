ABSTRACT
Crown-of-Thorn Starfish (COTS) outbreaks are a major cause of
coral loss on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and substantial surveil-
lance and control programs are underway in an attempt to manage
COTS populations to ecologically sustainable levels. We release a
large-scale, annotated underwater image dataset from a COTS out-
break area on the GBR, to encourage research on Machine Learning
and AI-driven technologies to improve the detection, monitoring,
and management of COTS populations at reef scale. The dataset
is released and hosted in a Kaggle competition that challenges the
international Machine Learning community with the task of COTS
detection from these underwater images 1.

1 INTRODUCTION
Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is a national icon and a World
Heritage Site, where tiny corals build continental-scale underwater
structures inhabited by thousands of other marine creatures. While
it is no secret that the GBR is under threat, it may not occur to
everyone that a species of starfish, the Crown-of-Thorns Starfish
(COTS), is one of the few main factors responsible for coral loss on
the GBR.

Hat-sized and covered with poisonous spines, COTS are a com-
mon reef species which feed on corals and have been an integral
part of coral reef ecosystems for millennia. However, their pop-
ulations can explode to thousands of starfish on individual reefs,
eating up most of the coral and leaving behind a white-scarred reef
that will take years to recover. For centuries the reef was resilient
enough to recover from such a natural life cycle, and affected coral
was given time to eventually grow back. This is no longer the case
as a combination of stress-factors now threaten health of the GBR.
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lists five key threats to

the GBR2 and the COTS outbreaks and their links to increased
farm pollution are at the top of the list, second only to the massive
bleaching events that impacted the reef in recent history.

Australian agencies are running a major monitoring and manage-
ment program in an effort to track and control COTS populations
to ecologically sustainable levels. One of the key methods used for
COTS and coral cover surveillance is the Manta Tow method, in
which a snorkel-diver is towed behind a boat to perform visual
assessment of the underwater habitat. The boat stops after every
transect (typically every 200 meters) to allow variables observed
during the tow to be recorded on a datasheet. Information from such
surveys is used to identify early outbreaks of COTS or characterize
existing outbreaks, and provides key information for the decision
support systems to better target deployment of COTS control teams.
While effective in general, the survey method has a few limitations
related to its operational scalability, data resolution, reliability and
traceability.

One way of improving the survey method is to deploy underwa-
ter imaging devices to collect data from the reefs and employ deep
learning algorithms to analyze the imagery, for example, to find

COTS and characterize coral cover. AI-driven environmental sur-
veys could significantly improve the efficiency and scale at which
marine scientists and reef managers survey for COTS, offering great
benefits to the COTS control program.

The dataset presented in this paper aims to make a bold statement
about the capabilities of Machine Learning and AI technologies
applied to broadscale surveillance of underwater habitats. In part-
nership with international community, we want to demonstrate
a step-change in delivering accurate, timely, and reliable assess-
ment of reef-scale ecosystems. We are releasing a large annotated
underwater imagery dataset collected on the GBR, collected in col-
laboration with COTS Control teams in a COTS outbreak area. We
have worked with domain experts and marine scientists to validate
the dataset annotations and are sharing the data with international
community through a Kaggle competition.

2 DATA COLLECTION METHOD
We have collected the data with GoPro Hero9 cameras that were
adapted for use in the Manta Tow method. Specifically, the cam-
era was attached to the bottom of the manta tow board that the
snorkeler-diver holds onto during the surveys. The camera pro-
vides an oblique field of view of the reef below the diver and the

Given an IoU threshold 𝐼𝑜𝑈 , the F𝛽 -score [1] is calculated based
on the number of true positives 𝑇 𝑃, false negatives 𝐹 𝑁 , and false
positives 𝐹 𝑃,

We use 𝛽 = 2 for the competition (F2-score).

The F2-score is calculated for IoU thresholds ranging from 0.3 to
0.8 at 0.05 increments, and we then use the average as the metric
for the main leaderboard.

distance to the reef dynamically changes as the diver explores the
reef. The distance is typically several meters from the bottom, but
can be as close as a few tens of centimeters or as far as 10 meters or
more. The survey boat moves at a speed up to 5 knots and it pulls
the diver for a duration of two minutes which equates to transect
of approximately 200 meters. The boat then stops to let the diver
record data observed during the transect on a sheet of paper. We set
the GoPro cameras to record videos continuously at 24 frames per
second at 3840x2160 resolution and manually removed the periods
of no activity between transects.

The dataset then underwent an AI-assisted annotation and qual-
ity assurance process, in which expert annotators, with the help
of pre-trained COTS detection models, identified all COTS in the
images. Each COTS detection in an image was marked with a rectan-
gular box using our annotation software. The dataset was collected
over a single day in October 2021 at a reef in the Swain Reefs region
of the GBR. There are variations in lighting, visibility, coral habitat,
depth, distance from bottom and viewpoint.

3 DATASET CHARACTERIZATION
The released dataset consists of sequences of underwater images
collected at five different areas on a reef in the GBR. It contains
more than 35k images, with hundreds of individual COTS visible.
The dataset is split between training and testing data and for the
purposes of the competition, we are releasing the training dataset
consisting of images annotated with bounding boxes around each
COTS (e.g. Fig. 2).

There are a few key factors that differentiate this dataset with

conventional object detection datasets:

• There is only one class, COTS, in this object detection dataset.
• The dataset naturally exhibits sequence-based annotations
as multiple images are taken of the same COTS as the boat
moves past it. Note that the evaluation is still individual
detection-based, similar to the COCO challenge.

• There could be multiple COTS in the same image and the
COTS can overlap each other. COTS are cryptic animals and
like to hide, thus only part of the animal might be visible in
some images.

• The key objective in surveys conducted by the monitoring
and control program is to find all visible COTS along the
defined transect paths, hence recall is prioritized. The eval-
uation is therefore based on the average F2-score (see next
section for details).

4 EVALUATION PROTOCOL
For a single image, the IoU of a proposed set of object pixels and a
set of true object pixels is calculated as: 𝐼𝑜𝑈 (𝑎, 𝑏) = 𝑎∩𝑏
𝑎∪𝑏 .

The procedure that counts True Positives (TP), False Positives

(FP), and False Negatives (FN) is defined as:

1: procedure JudgeDetections(Groundtruth B = {𝑏𝑖 }, submis-

sion S = {𝑠𝑖 }, IoU threshold 𝐼𝑜𝑈 )
