Abstract: Recently, there are unprecedented data growth originating from different online platforms which contribute to big data 
in terms of volume, velocity, variety and veracity (4Vs). Given this nature of big data which is unstructured, performing analytics 
to  extract  meaningful  information  is  currently  a  great  challenge  to  big  data  analytics.  Collecting  and  analyzing  unstructured 
textual data allows decision makers to study the escalation of comments/posts on our social media platforms. Hence, there is need 
for automatic big data analysis to overcome the noise and the non-reliability of these unstructured dataset from the digital media 
platforms. However, current machine  learning algorithms  used are performance driven  focusing on the classification/prediction 
accuracy based on known properties learned from the training samples. With the learning task in a large dataset, most machine 
learning models are known to require high computational cost which eventually leads to computational complexity. In this work, 
two supervised machine learning algorithms are combined with text mining techniques to produce a hybrid model which consists 
of Naïve Bayes and support vector machines (SVM). This is to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the results obtained and 
also to reduce the computational cost and complexity. The system also provides an open platform where a group of persons with a 
common  interest  can  share  their  comments/messages  and  these  comments  classified  automatically  as  legal  or  illegal.  This 
improves the quality of conversation among users. The hybrid model was developed using WEKA tools and Java programming 
language. The result shows that the hybrid model gave 96.76% accuracy as against the 61.45% and 69.21% of the Naïve Bayes 
and SVM models respectively. 

Keywords: Big Data, Text Mining, Text Classification, Text Categorization, Feature Extraction, Classifiers, Data Mining. 

I. INTRODUCTION 

Online  social  networks (OSN) and  micro-blogging  websites are attracting internet users  more than any other kind of  websites. 
Their contents are rapidly growing in speed, volume, velocity and variety, constituting a very interesting example of big data. Big 
data  have  been  attracting  the  attention  of  researchers  who  are  interested  in  the  analysis  of  people‘s  opinions  and  the 
structure/distribution  of  users  in  digital  media  platforms.  These  websites  offer  an  open  space  for  people  to  discuss  and  share 
thoughts and opinions and as such, the nature and the huge number of posts, comments and messages exchanged make it almost 
impossible to control their content. Also given the different backgrounds, cultures and believes, many people tend to use illegal 
comments/messages when discussing with people who do not share the same backgrounds. Illegal comment/message is a speech 
that is intended to insult, offend or intimidate a person because of some trait (as race, religion, sexual orientation, national origin 
and  so  on).  Collecting  and  analyzing  these  data  allows  decision  makers  to  study  the  escalation  of  such  comments/messages. 
Hence, there is need for automatic big data analysis to overcome  the  noise and the non-reliability of these unstructured dataset 
from the digital media platforms.There are different existing models for machine learning on big data and they include:  Decision 
Tree  based  model,  Linear  regression  based  model,  Neural  Network,  Bayesian  Network,  Support  vector  machines,  Nearest 
Neighbor, KNN, Naïve Bayes and so on. To reduce the individual limitations of basic machine learning models, a hybrid model is 
proposed in this work. This will also help to exploit their different generalization mechanisms and improve the expected output of 
semi structured sequential data. The strengths of Naïve Bayes are that it is very simple and highly scalable on large dataset and 
can learn incrementally because it counts the observed variables and update the probability distribution table.It has also proven to 
be  one  of  the  best  in  text  classification,  spam  filtering,  hybrid  recommender  system,  online  application  and  simple  emotion 
modeling ( Ravindra Bachate, 2016). Super vector machines (SVM) are also ranked as one of the best off the shelf supervised 
learning algorithm as they provide superior generalization performance, requires less examples for training and can tackle high 
dimensional  data  with  the  help  of  kernels  (Yinglie  Tian  et  al,2012).  SVM  also  tends  to  perform  well  for  classification  of  text 
because of itsability to generalize into high dimensions, which is often the case with text categorization. 

Based on these, two supervised machine learning algorithms, SVM and Naïve Bayes are combined in this  work to classify the 
comments in big data emanating from different blogs. 

II. RELATED WORKS 

Junfei  et  al  (2016)  presented  a  survey  of  the  latest  advances  in  researches  on  machine  learning  for  big  data  processing;  they 
reviewed  machine  learning  techniques  and  highlighted  some  promising  learning  methods  such  as  representation  learning,  deep 
learning,  distributed  and  parallel  learning,  transfer  learning,  active  learning,  and  kernel-based  learning.  They  concluded  by 
investigating the close connections of machine learning with signal processing techniques for big data processing. 

Moorthy&  Gandhi,  (2018)reviewed  security  issues  in  big  data  and  evaluated  the  performance  of  Machine  Learning  (ML)  and 
Deep Learning (DL) algorithm in a critical environment. They concluded that both ML and DL have security issues. 

Perry, (2013) proposed the selection of appropriate  machine learning methodologies that can offer substantial improvements in 
accuracy  and  performance.  He  proffered  that  even  at  this  early  stage  in  testing  machine  learning  on  conflict  prediction,  full 
models offer more predictive power than simply using a prior outbreak of violence as the leading indicator of current violence.

This suggests that a refined data selection methodology combined with strategic use of machine learning algorithms could indeed 
offer a significant addition to the early warning toolkit. His work only provided a feasibility study on conflict prediction 

Asha et al,. (2013), stated that machine learning algorithms (MLA) are sequential and recursive and the accuracy of MLA‘s rely 
on size of the data (i.e., greater the data the more accurate is the result). Absence of a reliable framework for MLA to work for big 
data  has  made  these algorithms  to cripple their ability to  reach the  fullest potential.  Hadoop is one such  framework  that offers 
distributed storage and parallel data processing. The Existing problem to implement MLA on Hadoop is that the MLA‘s need data 
to be stored in single place because of its recursive nature, but Hadoop does not support data sharing. They proposed an approach 
to build Machine Learning models for recursive MLA‘s on Hadoop so that the power of Machine Learning and Hadoop can be 
made  available  to  process  big  data,  and  then  compared  the  performance  of  ID3  decision  tree  algorithm,  K-means  clustering 
algorithm and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm on both serial implementation and parallel implementation using Hadoop 

Awad  (2012),  used  machine  learning  algorithms  like  SVM,  KNN  and  GIS  to  perform  a  behavior  comparison  on  web  pages 
classifications problem. From their experiment, they concluded that when using SVM with small number of negative documents 
to build the centroids it has the smallest storage requirement and the least on line test computation cost. But almost all GIS with 
different number of nearest neighbors have an even higher storage requirement and on line test computation cost than KNN.  

Bart  (2017),  noted  that  financial  institutions  (FIs)  are  looking  to  more  powerful  analytical  approaches  in  order  to  manage  and 
mine increasing amounts of regulatory reporting data and unstructured data, for purposes of compliance and risk management. He 
showed that the ability of machine learning methods to analyze very large amounts of data, while offering a high granularity  and 
depth  of  predictive  analysis,  can  improve  analytical  capabilities  across  risk  management  and  compliance  areas  in  financial 
institutions 

Apoorva &  Anupam (2017), said that  machine learning have  been playing a pivotal role for decades in almost every field like 
Finance, Weather  forecasting, Medical  science, Engineering optimization problems, Software cost prediction, Pattern  matching 
etc-. With the  improvement in hardware  technology and availability of  huge  amount of training data, deep learning techniques 
have emerged as the most important machine learning algorithms. Some of the popular deep learning techniques are CNN, RNN, 
LSTM, etc-. Although deep learning techniques give far better results than the shallow traditional machine learning algorithms, 
there  are  some  issues  associated  with  them  like:  the  need  for  huge  amount  of  data  for  training,  need  for  expensive  hardware 
resources and the requirement for very high running time. They concluded that despite these limitations, deep learning algorithms 
are very useful and are being widely used for solving various problems related to different fields. 

LinaZhouet  al  (2017)  introduced  a  framework  of  ML  on  big  data  (MLBiD)  to  guide  the  discussion  of  its  opportunities  and 
challenges. The framework is centered on ML which follows the phases of preprocessing, learning, and evaluation. In addition, 
the framework is also comprised of four other components, namely big data, user, domain, and system. The phases of ML and the 
components of MLBiD provide directions for identification of associated opportunities and challenges and open up future work in 
many unexplored or under explored research areas. 

Mohammed    et  al,  (2016)  proposed  an  intuitive  but  yet  simple  machine  learning  (ML)  approach  that  consists  of  two  generic 
algorithms augmenting one another to solve problems they are not designed to solve. They attempted to augment the architecture 
of traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a state machine acting as a form of short term memory in addition to help 
divide the work amongst multiple modular ANNs through transitioning from state to state.  

Alexyet al (2016) presented a comprehensive review of the most effective content-based e-mail spam filtering techniques. They 
focused  primarily  on  Machine  Learning-based  spam  filters  and  their  variants,  and  reported  on  a  broad  review  ranging  from 
surveying the relevant ideas, efforts, effectiveness, and the current progress. They concluded by measuring the impact of Machine 
Learning-based filters and explore the promising offshoots of latest developments. 

Yenala, et al (2017) proposed a novel deep learning-based technique for automatically identifying inappropriate languages in a 
text. They focused on solving the problem in two application scenarios: query completion suggestions in search engines and users 
conversations  in  messengers.  They  proposed  a  novel  deep  learning  architecture  called  convolutional  bi-directional  LSTM  (C-
BiLSTM) which combines the strengths of both convolution neural network (CNN) and Bi-directional LSTMs (BLSTM). 

Vandersmissen, et al (2012) reported that a combination of support vector machine (SVM) and word list-based classifier performs 
best and observed their models perform badly with less context which is usually the case with search queries as well. However, 
they specifically focused on the detection of sexually inappropriate and racist messages only. 

Georgioset al (2018) addressed the important problem of discerning hateful content in social media. They proposed a detection 
scheme that is an ensemble of recurrent neural network (RNN) classifiers and it incorporates various features associated with user 
related  information  such  as  the  users  tendency  towards  racism  or  sexism.  The  scheme  can  successfully  distinguish  racism  and 
sexism messages from normal text and achieve higher classification quality. 

Arthur  (2018)  discussed  about  the  implementation  of  a  simple  anti-spam  control  based  on  the  famous  naïve  Bayesian 
classification algorithm that can be actively  used to locate  and filter out those texts (E-mails, SMS,  …)  from a local  messages 
database that most likely might contain spam or other unsolicited data. 

Davidson  T.  et  al,  2017  automatically  classified  tweets  into  hate  speech,  offensive  and  neither  of  the  above.  They  compared 
among logistic regression, naïve Bayes, decision trees, random forest and SVM. They concluded that logistic regression gave the 
best prediction. They never combined any of the algorithms. 

Hajime  Watanabe  et  al,  2018,  proposed  a  new  method  to  detect  hate  speech  in  twitter  and  classified  the  tweets  into  hateful, 
offensive and clean. They used only one algorithm J48graft.

Georgios  K.  Pitsilis  et  al,  2018  used  deep  learning  algorithm  to  address  the  important  problem  discerning  hateful  contents  in 
social media. They were able to distinguish racism and sexism messages from normal text. 

Grondahl  et  al,  2018  reproduced  seven  state-of-the-art  hate  speech  detection  models  from  prior  work,  and  showed  that  they 
perform  well  only  when  tested  on  the  same  type  of  data  they  were  trained  on.  Based  on  these  results,  they  argued  that  for 
successful  hate  speech  detection,  model  architecture  is  less  important  than  the  type  of  data  and  labeling  criteria.  They  further 
showed that all proposed detection techniques are brittle against adversaries who can (automatically) insert typos, change word 
boundaries or add in-nocuous words to the original hate speech. 

Durairaj  M.  et  al,  2017  combined  K  nearest  neighbor,  Support  vector  machine  (SVM)  and  Naïve  Bayes  with  text  mining 
techniques  to  classify  some  text  document.  This  system  performed  very  well  with  the  accuracy  of  83.5%  but  still  had  some 
challenges.  These  challenges  include  addressing  the  problems  like  handling  large  text  corpora,  similarity  of  words  in  text 
documents and association of text documents with a subset of class categories. 

III. METHODOLOGY 

The methodology adopted in this work is the Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOADM) with text mining techniques. The 
hybrid model was developed using WEKA tools which is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. It 
contains  tools  for  data  pre-processing  and  classification  which  makes  it  very  suitable  for  the  development  of  the  new  hybrid 
model. The codes were developed in JAVA programming language and a confusion matrix used to evaluate the accuracy  

A. System Design and Implementation 

Text classification involves preprocessing of the unstructured text documents retrieved from the different  web blogs used. After 
the preprocessing comes the feature extraction of labeled corpus (machine learning classifier for training data) followed by  the 
model selection and classifier. These steps can be seen in figure 4.1

Figure 3.1 Data Flowdiagram of the proposed system 

 i)  Data set collection  

The dataset was collected from the online social  web blogs. These blogs are where people with different backgrounds, culture, 
beliefs and mind sets read trending news and make comments at any point in time. These comments/messages were retrieved as 
the unstructured data set. The unstructured data set were collected from the following links which form the basis of the big data 
analytics:  

a)  https://foreignpolicy.com/comments_view/?view_post_comments=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/14/if-islam-is-a-

religion-of-violence-so-is-christianity/ 

b)  http://theconversation.com/challenging-the-notion-that-religion-fosters-violence-85677 
c)  https://www.nieuwwij.nl/english/karen-armstrong-nothing-islam-violent-christianity/ 
d)  https://www.kaggle.com/c/detecting-insults-in-social-commentary 
e)  http://www.religionforums.org/ . 

These  web-blogs  allow  anonymous  user  comments  on  articles.  Their  policy  on  which  comments  are  allowed  is  not  very 
restrictive,  meaning  a  lot  of  abusive  and  inappropriate  comments  are  still  available  online.  This  fact  is  of  great  importance  in 
order to havea representative data set.These comments are unlabeled and the training data must first be manually labeled to train a 
machine learning algorithm to detect legal/illegal comments. 

ii) Preprocessing 

The preprocessing stage is a major task of cleaning up the data gathered from unstructured web blog, by labeling those data into 
their respective classes. This may involve 85% of human effort to clean up the dataset in order to be used for  building the model 
and reduce the error during the binary classification  

iii) Feature set Extraction 

Feature extraction is a dimensionality reduction process where the dataset is reduced to more manageable features for processing 
while  still  accurately  and  completely  describing  the  original  dataset.  It  is  intended  to  be  informative  and  non-redundant, 
facilitating the subsequent learning and generalization steps in some cases leading to better human interpretations.  Following are 
different feature selection model while dealing with big data classification.

Accuracy rates 

The accuracies of two classifiers have been represented in Table 4.13. Thus, training data set ―SVM‖ has the best accuracy rate of 
69.21% and training data set ―Naïve Bayes‖ has an accuracy rate of 61.43% which is only next to that of ―SVM‖. Also on the test 
set,  ―SVM‖  has  the  best  accuracy  rate  of  83.3611%  and  test  data  set  ―Naïve  Bayes  has  62.3544%. Based  on  these  results,  the 
accuracy of hybridization of SVM + Naïve for the big data analytics can be seen in the table below.

The propagation of illegal messages on social media has been increasing significantly in recent years. This may be as a  result of 
the anonymity and mobility of such platforms, as well as the changing political climate from many places in the world. Despite 
substantial  effort  from  law  enforcement  departments,  legislative  bodies  as  well  as  millions  of  investment  from  social  media 
companies, it is widely recognized that effective counter measures rely on automated semantic analysis of such content. 

A  crucial  task  in  this  direction  is  the  detection  and  classification  of  such  messages/comments  based  on  its  targeting 
characteristics.This work makes several contributions to state of the art in this research area. A thorough data analysis was carried 
out to understand the extremely unbalanced nature and the lack of discriminative features of illegal content in the unstructured 
dataset one has to deal with in such tasks. However, it is always difficult to clearly decide on a sentence whether it contains illegal 
words  or  not  if  the  message  is  hiding  behind  sarcasm  or  if  no  clear  words  showing  illegal,  racism  or  stereotyping  exist. 
Furthermore, online social networks are full of ironic and joking content that might seem illegal which in reality is not. 

A  new  hybrid  model  combining  the  Naïve  Bayes  and  super  vector  machines  is  used  for  more  accuracy  and  efficiency.  The 
methods were thoroughly evaluated on a very large collection of web blog datasets for illegal messages to show that they can  be 
particularly effective on detecting and classifying the contents. The results obtained from the different algorithms really shows 
that  each  of  them  can  perform  the  analysis  very  well  but  the  combination  of  the  two  algorithms  actually  yielded  much  more 
accuracy and efficiency. Clearly, combining models improves model accuracyand reduces model variance, and the more models 
combined  the  better  the  result..  However,  determining  which  individual  models  combine  best  from  training  results  only  is 
difficult—there  is  no  clear  trend.  Simply  selecting  the  best  individual  models  does  not  necessarily  lead  to  a  better  combined 
result. Combining models across algorithm families reduces error compared to the best single models. 

A. Suggestion for Further Research 

The system can be improved and advanced based on the following: 

1.  To  explore  other  methods  or  algorithms  that  aim  at  compensating  the  lack  of  training  data  in  supervised  learning  tasks. 
Methods such as transfer learning could be potentially promising as they study the problem of adapting supervised models 
trained in a resource-rich context to a resource-scarce context. 

2.  To investigate whether features discovered from one illegal class can be transferred to another thus enhancing the training of 

each other. 

3.  To train more models and combine their predictions for more robust and accurate models.
