Abstract

Testing is recommended for all close contacts of conﬁrmed COVID-19 patients. However, existing
group testing methods are oblivious to the circumstances of contagion provided by contact tracing. Here,
we build upon a well-known semi-adaptive pool testing method, Dorfman’s method with imperfect tests,
and derive a simple group testing method based on dynamic programming that is speciﬁcally designed to
use the information provided by contact tracing. Experiments using a variety of reproduction numbers
and dispersion levels, including those estimated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, show that
the pools found using our method result in a signiﬁcantly lower number of tests than those found using
standard Dorfman’s method, especially when the number of contacts of an infected individual is small.
Moreover, our results show that our method can be more beneﬁcial when the secondary infections are
highly overdispersed.

Introduction

As countries around the world learn to live with COVID-19, the use of testing, contact tracing and isolation
(TTI) has been proven to be as important as social distancing for containing the spread of the disease [1].
However, as the infection levels grow, TTI reaches a tipping point and its eﬀectiveness quickly degrades as the
health authorities lack resources to trace and test all contacts of diagnosed individuals [2]. In this context,
there has been a ﬂurry of interest on the use of group testing—testing groups of samples simultaneously—to
scale up testing under limited resources.

The literature on group testing methods has a rich history, starting with the seminal work by Dorfman
[3–5]. However, existing methods [6, 7], including those developed and used in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic [8–16], are oblivious to the circumstances of contagion provided by contact tracing and assume
statistical independence of the samples to be tested. This assumption can be seemingly justiﬁed by classi-
cal epidemiological models where the number of infections caused by a single individual follows a Poisson
distribution. However, in COVID-19, there is growing evidence suggesting that the number of secondary
infections caused by a single individual is overdispersed —most individuals do not infect anyone but a few
superspreaders infect many in infection hotspots [17–23]. Overdispersion has been also observed in MERS
and SARS [24–26]. In this work, our goal is to develop group testing methods that are speciﬁcally designed
to use the information provided by contact tracing and are eﬀective in the presence of overdispersion.

More speciﬁcally, we build upon a well-known semi-adaptive pool testing method, Dorfman’s method with
imperfect tests [5, 27]. In Dorfman’s method, samples from multiple individuals are ﬁrst pooled together
and evaluated using a single test. If a pooled sample is negative, all individuals in the pooled sample are
deemed negative.
If the pooled sample is positive, each individual sample from the pool is then tested
independently. However, rather than modeling the probability that each individual sample is positive using
an independent Bernoulli distribution as in Dorfman’s method, we assume that: (i) the samples to be tested
are all the contacts of a diagnosed individual during their infectious period, who are identiﬁed using contact
tracing, and (ii) the number of true positive samples, i.e., secondary infections by the diagnosed individual,

follows an overdispersed negative binomial distribution [22, 23]. Given any arbitrary set of pools, we then
compute the average number of tests and the expected number of false negatives and false positives under
our model. Finally, we introduce a dynamic programming algorithm to eﬃciently ﬁnd the set of pools
that optimally trade oﬀ the average number of tests, false negatives and false positives in polynomial time.
Experiments using a variety of reproduction numbers and dispersion levels in secondary infections, including
those observed for COVID-19, show that the pools found using our method result in a signiﬁcantly lower
average number of tests than those found using standard Dorfman’s method, especially when the number of
contacts of an infected individual is small. Moreover, our results show that our method can be particularly
beneﬁcial when the number of secondary infections caused by an infectious individual is highly overdispersed.

Methods

Modeling overdispersion of infected contacts

Previous work have mostly built on the assumption that the number of infections X caused by a single
individual follows a Poisson distribution with mean r, so X
Pois(r), where r is often called the eﬀective
reproduction number. However, having equal mean and variance, the Poisson is unable to capture settings
where the number of cases to be tested for exhibits higher variance. Following recent work in the context of
COVID-19 [19, 22], we instead model X using a generalized negative binomial distribution. For a (standard)
negative binomial distribution, X
NBin(k, p) can be interpreted as the number of successes before the
k-th failure in a sequence of Bernoulli trials with success probability p. For a generalized negative binomial
distribution, k > 0 can take real values and the probability mass function is given by

where k is called the dispersion parameter and parameterizes higher variance of the distribution for small k.
Since E[X] = kp/(1
p), we assume in this work that the number of secondary infections X is distributed as
NBin (k, p) with p = r/(k +r), hence parameterizing X via its mean E[X] = r and dispersion parameter
X
k. Under this parameterization, Var[X] = r(1 + r/k), which is greater than the variance of the Poisson r for
NBin(k, r/(k + r)) converges in distribution to

shown to often be negligible [28], the eﬀect can easily be addressed by making the conditional T (

Dorfman testing under overdispersion of infected contacts

and ﬁrst testing the
Dorfman testing proceeds by pooling individuals into non-overlapping partitions of
combined samples of each pool using a single test. Every member of a pool is marked as negative if their
combined sample is negative.
If a combined sample of a pool is positive, each individual of the pool is
subsequently tested individually to determine who exactly is marked positive in the pool.

Figure 1: Performance of our method (Algorithm 1) and Dorfman’s method for various values of the number
of contacts of a diagnosed individual during their infectious period. Panel (a) shows the number of tests
per contact, where the dots represent the average value and the error bars cover 90% of the observations.
Panel (b) shows the average pool size. Panel (c) shows the empirical distribution of the percentage of tests
saved by using our method instead of Dorfman’s method, where we exclude the highest and lowest 5% of
observations. In all panels, we set the sensitivity and speciﬁcity to se = sp = 0.95, and sample the number
of secondary infections from a truncated negative binomial distribution with mean r = 2.5 and dispersion
parameter k = 0.1 [19, 20, 29, 30]. For each combination of method and parameter values, the averages and
quantiles in all panels are estimated using 100,000 samples.

Results and Discussion

We perform simulations to evaluate Algorithm 1 against Dorfman’s method in its ability to optimally trade
oﬀ resources and false test outcomes in the presence of overdispersed distributions of secondary infections.
To generate the infection states for each contact, we ﬁrst ﬁx a number of contacts N and sample the
number of secondary infections n
qr,k,N (n), where qr,k,N (n) is a truncated negative binomial distribution
as deﬁned in Eq. 1. Then, we select n of the N contacts at random and set their status to infected. To
implement Dorfman’s method, we use a variation of Algorithm 1 in which the expected numbers of tests,
false negatives and false positives are computed assuming an independent individual probability of infection
p = Eqr,k,N [n]/N , using the formulas derived by Abrahamian et al. [5].

∼

We ﬁrst compare the performance of our method and Dorfman’s method at ﬁnding the pools that min-
imize the number of tests (i.e., λ1 = λ2 = 0) for ﬁxed values of the reproductive number r and dispersion
parameter k matching estimations done during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 1 sum-
marizes the results with respect to the number of contacts N of the diagnosed individuals. The results
show that our method achieves a lower average number of tests across all values of N , with its competitive
advantage being greater when the number of contacts is small and less apparent as the number of contacts is
increasing. Moreover, Dorfman’ method chooses pool sizes that increase with the number of contacts while
the ones chosen by our method remain relatively constant. This leads to signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the
distributions of the number of tests performed under the two methods. For example, as shown in Figure 1(c),
when the number of contacts is N = 20, our method is most likely to perform about 50% less tests than
Dorfman’s. However, due to the more conservative pool sizes given by Dorfman’s method, there is a small
probability that our method ends up performing more tests, sometimes even double the amount.

Next, we investigate to what extent our method oﬀers a competitive advantage with respect to Dorfman’s
method for additional values of the reproductive number r and dispersion parameter k diﬀerent than those
estimated during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 2 summarizes the results, which show
that our method oﬀers the greatest competitive advantage whenever the number of secondary infections is
overdispersed, i.e., k
0. Moreover, as the number of contacts N increases, the competitive advantage is
greater for larger values of the reproductive number r.

→

Finally, we explore the trade-oﬀ between the average number of tests that our method achieves and the
false positive and negative rates, under diﬀerent values of the parameters λ1 and λ2. Figure 3 summarizes the

sensitivity sp. In each panel, we either penalize the false negative rate (i.e., we vary λ1 and set λ2 = 0)
or the false positive rate (i.e., we vary λ2 and set λ1 = 0). Accordingly, for the former, we show the false
negative rate vs average number of tests (in blue) and, for the latter, we show the false positive rate vs
average number of tests (in pink). Here, we set the number of contacts to N = 100 and sample the number
of positive infections from a truncated negative binomial distribution with mean r = 2.5 and dispersion
parameter k = 0.1. In each experiment, we estimate averages using 100,000 samples.

results, which show that, to achieve lower false negative and false positive rates, more tests need to be per-
formed. When trading oﬀ the number of tests with the number of false positives (λ1 = 0, λ2 > 0), our method
gradually changes the average pool size, leading to many possible trade-oﬀ points between the number of tests
and the false positive rate. When λ2 takes small values, the optimal solution leads to pool sizes that minimize
the number of tests, while the solution consists of pools of two contacts when λ2 gets signiﬁcantly larger.
When balancing the number of tests with the number of false negatives (λ1 > 0, λ2 = 0), there are only two
or three possible solutions, with the extreme ones corresponding to pool sizes minimizing the number of tests
and pools of size one, i.e., individual testing for all. We noticed that the expected number of false negatives
in a pool grows linearly with its size for sizes greater than one, therefore, making the exact size of the pool
irrelevant in terms of the expected total number of false negatives. As a consequence, this leads to only a few
optimal solutions where some of the contacts are individually tested while the rest of them are split into pools.
Our results have direct implications for the allocation of limited and imperfect testing resources in future
pandemics whenever there exists evidence of substantial overdispersion in the number of secondary infections.
In this context, we acknowledge that more research is needed to more accurately characterize the level of
overdispersion in a pandemic. Moreover, it would be interesting to extend our algorithm using distributions
