Abstract. In this paper, we present machine learning models based on ran-
dom forest classiﬁers, support vector machines, gradient boosted decision trees,
and artiﬁcial neural networks to predict participation in cancer screening pro-
grams in South Korea. The top performing model was based on gradient
boosted decision trees and achieved an area under the receiver operating char-
acteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.8706 and average precision of 0.8776. The
results of this study are encouraging and suggest that with further research,
these models can be directly applied to Korea’s healthcare system, thus in-
creasing participation in Korea’s National Cancer Screening Program.

1. Introduction

In South Korea, cancer is the leading cause of death. In fact, in 2018, cancer
was responsible for 26.5% of all deaths in the country ([9]). As the early detection
and diagnosis of cancers increase a patient’s change of survival considerably, the
Korean government established a National Cancer Screening Program, covering 6
major cancers, including gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, cervical
cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer. To increase participation in this program,
the government oﬀers free screening tests for National Health Insurance (NHI)
beneﬁciaries in the lower 50% income bracket; for those in the upper 50% income
bracket, 90% of associated costs are covered by the NHI ([7]).

However, even with such policies, the participation rate in cancer screening pro-
grams was 55.6% in 2019 and showed minimal improvement from 50.1% in 2015
([8]).

In this paper, we aim to expand upon previous research conducted on the factors
associated with participation in cancer screening programs by developing machine
learning models to predict participation in cancer screening programs.

First, section 2 will discuss related studies and associated factors. Next, section
3 will present the method with utilized data, selected variables, data pre-processing
steps, and chosen algorithms. Finally, sections 4 will present experimental results
and sections 5 and 6 will discuss the results and any implications of the ﬁndings.

2. Related Studies

A number of studies have been conducted on the factors associated with cancer
screening participation. With various statistical tools and models, these studies
found that factors including education level, income level, and smoking habits are
signiﬁcantly correlated with participation in cancer screening ([6],[2],[3]).

However, very few studies have been conducted on the application of machine
learning to predict cancer screening participation. One particular study utilized a
hybrid neural network to predict breast screening attendance (breast cancer) in
the United Kingdom and achieved 80% accuracy for the algorithm ([1]). Another
study utilized machine learning (support vector machines, random forests, etc.) to
predict hospital attendance and achieved 0.852 for the area under receiver operating
characteristic curve ([4]).

3. Method

3.1. Data. Data was obtained from the Seventh Korea National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey, including data from 2016 2018. 24269 individuals par-
ticipated in the survey (10611 households) and participants were chosen through
stratiﬁed cluster sampling. More speciﬁcally, primary sampling units were selected
based on results from the annual Population and Housing Census.

Available data for the 3 years ranges from demographic information to dietary

habits and includes a total of 852 variables ([5]).

3.2. Features/Variables. Variables were selected based on ﬁndings from past
studies and their relevance were veriﬁed with the Chi-Squared test ([6],[2],[3]). The
55 (89 after pre-processing — one-hot encoding) chosen variables are listed below.

3.3. Data Pre-processing. First, all rows containing unavailable (marked as ”un-
known”) or missing (null) values were removed from the data-set. Next, all ordinal
categorical variables were label encoded and all nominal categorical variables were
one-hot encoded. All variables were scaled with Min-Max scaling to a ﬁxed range
(0 to 1) as well.

Finally, the dataset was shuﬄed and split into training and test sets (ratio of

80/20 respectively).

3.4. Algorithms. Algorithms chosen for this task include random forest classiﬁers,
support vector machines, gradient boosted decision trees (XGBoost), and artiﬁcial
neural networks (with back-propagation).

For all algorithms, grid search and 5-fold cross validation were performed to ﬁnd
optimal hyper-parameters. Each model was then evaluated with the held-out test
set. Note that all experiments were conducted via Google Colaboratory.

4. Results

The performance of the 4 algorithms can be found below in Table 2 and corre-
sponding plots for the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) and Precision-
Recall curve (PR Curve) can be found in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4.

To evaluate each model, 3 accuracy metrics were chosen: Area under the Re-
ceiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), Average Precision (Area under
the Precision-Recall curve), and Accuracy. Note that AUC-ROC was used as the
accuracy metric for hyper-parameter tuning.

5. Discussion

We see that all 4 models achieved scores between 0.8 and 0.9 for the 3 chosen
accuracy metrics. The top performing model was based on gradient boosted decision
trees (XGBoost) and achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.8706 and average precision of
0.8776.

One point to note is that the 4 models did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly in terms of
achieved scores. As such, one option to improve prediction accuracy would be to
incorporate more features/variables from the original dataset to form more complex
models.

Furthermore, there was minimal discrepancy between the models’ performance

during cross-validation and testing, indicating how over-ﬁtting was avoided.

6. Conclusion

One limitation of the models developed in this paper is that the Korea National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey contains self-reported data. As such,
portions of the data used (especially answers to subjective survey questions) may
have been erroneous, which would reduce the accuracy of the model.

Nevertheless, the models developed in this paper can be directly applied to Ko-
rea’s healthcare system. Regional public health oﬃcials could use these models (or
variations of these models — depending on data availability) to predict individuals
who are likely to not participate in cancer screening programs. Oﬃcials could then
contact these individuals, informing them of screening locations and dates. Both
public and private hospitals could make use of these models as well, depending on
the availability of data.

If such a system is implemented, Korea’s National Cancer Screening Program

may see a rise in participation.

Further research on this topic with models of greater complexity and additional
features may lead to higher prediction accuracy and a rise in overall cancer screening
program participation. For instance, varying the total number of features used may
lead to more eﬃcient models. The use of complex neural networks with various
types of layers may result in models of greater accuracy as well.
