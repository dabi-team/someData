ABSTRACT

Studies of Galactic structure and evolution have beneﬁtted enormously from Gaia kinematic infor-
mation, though additional, intrinsic stellar parameters like age are required to best constrain Galactic
models. Asteroseismology is the most precise method of providing such information for ﬁeld star pop-
ulations en masse, but existing samples for the most part have been limited to a few narrow ﬁelds of
view by the CoRoT and Kepler missions. In an eﬀort to provide well-characterized stellar parameters
across a wide range in Galactic position, we present the second data release of red giant asteroseismic
parameters for the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program (GAP). We provide νmax and ∆ν based on six
independent pipeline analyses; ﬁrst-ascent red giant branch (RGB) and red clump (RC) evolutionary
state classiﬁcations from machine learning; and ready-to-use radius & mass coeﬃcients, κR & κM ,
which, when appropriately multiplied by a solar-scaled eﬀective temperature factor, yield physical
stellar radii and masses. In total, we report 4395 radius and mass coeﬃcients, with typical uncertain-
ties of 3.3% (stat.) ± 1% (syst.) for κR and 7.7% (stat.) ± 2% (syst.) for κM among RGB stars, and
5.0% (stat.) ± 1% (syst.) for κR and 10.5% (stat.) ± 2% (syst.) for κM among RC stars. We verify that
the sample is nearly complete — except for a dearth of stars with νmax (cid:46) 10 − 20µHz — by comparing

to Galactic models and visual inspection. Our asteroseismic radii agree with radii derived from Gaia
Data Release 2 parallaxes to within 2.2 ± 0.3% for RGB stars and 2.0 ± 0.6% for RC stars.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Galactic Archaeology Program (GAP; Stello et al.
2015) has taken advantage of the multidirectional view
of the Galaxy oﬀered by the re-purposed Kepler mission,
K2. With hundreds of thousands of stars observed, K2’s
potential for studying the Galaxy is signiﬁcant. Instead
of a single snapshot of the Galaxy with Kepler (Borucki
et al. 2008), K2 (Howell et al. 2014) observed along the
ecliptic, including the local disk, the bulge, and even dis-
tant regions of the halo. Importantly for this work, the
K2 mission has delivered the quality of data necessary
for asteroseismic analysis.

The K2 GAP aims to provide fundamental stellar pa-
rameters for red giants across the Galaxy. In combina-
tion with temperature and metallicity information, as-
teroseismology can provide stellar radii, masses, and,
when combined with stellar models, ages. Kepler red gi-
ant asteroseismology has yielded important ﬁndings for
Galactic archaeology, including verifying the presence
of a vertical age gradient in the Galactic disc (Miglio
et al. 2013; Casagrande et al. 2016); testing Galactic
chemical evolution models (e.g., Spitoni et al. 2020);
and conﬁrming an age diﬀerence between chemically-
and kinematically-deﬁned thin and thick discs (Silva
Aguirre et al. 2018). Nevertheless, the Kepler aster-
oseismic sample was not curated for Galactic studies,
and so GAP’s deliberate and well-understood target se-
lection for Galactic archaeology purposes sets up K2 to
be a more useful tool for Galactic archaeology, particu-
larly in light of its expanded view of the Galaxy. Indeed,
the K2 data is providing interesting insights into the rel-
ative ages of chemically-deﬁned stellar populations be-
yond the solar vicinity (Rendle et al. 2019, Warﬁeld et
al., in preparation).

K2 ’s potential is tempered, however, by a decreased
photometric precision compared to Kepler and a ∼ 80d
dwell time per campaign instead of up to ∼ 4yr for Ke-
pler. These two limitations mean that K2 is mostly
suited for giants with logg above ∼ 1.4; probes one to
two magnitudes ‘shallower’ than Kepler ; and yields less
precise asteroseismic measurements compared to Kepler
(Stello et al. 2017). And, although the accuracy of stel-
lar parameters derived through asteroseismology is at
the percent level (e.g., Silva Aguirre et al. 2012; Huber
et al. 2012; Zinn et al. 2019b), at this level, there are
measurement systematics that need to be corrected for
(Pinsonneault et al. 2018). We therefore devote special
attention in what follows to understanding the statis-
tical and systematic uncertainties in our asteroseismic
quantities.

We have previously released a collection of νmax and
∆ν values for 1210 K2 GAP red giants in Stello et al.
(2017). The present release covers campaigns 4, 6, &
7, and comprises 4395 stars. In addition to the global
asteroseismic parameters, νmax and ∆ν, we also provide
scaling-relation quantities that, when combined with an
eﬀective temperature, yield radii and masses. We also
provide estimates of systematic and statistical errors on
the asteroseismic quantities, and establish the complete-
ness of observed targets in order to ensure a well-deﬁned
selection function.

2. DATA

2.1. Target selection

In the context of the GAP, analysis of the campaigns
presented here were prioritized due to their coverage
of the sky: the Galactic center (C7) the Galactic anti-
center (C4) and out of the Galactic plane (C6). These
results will ultimately be joined with a forthcoming anal-
ysis of the rest of the K2 campaigns for which GAP tar-
gets have been observed. The GAP targets red giants
because they are bright (probing far into the Galaxy)
and because their oscillations are detectable from the
K2 long-cadence data, which has a Nyquist frequency
of ∼ 280µHz. All GAP targets for campaigns 4, 6 &
7 were selected from 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006) to
have J − K > 0.5 and good photometric quality based
on 2MASS ﬂags.1 The proposed targets passing these
selection criteria were prioritized based on a rank or-
dering in V -band magnitude from bright to faint.2 C4
and C6 targets were chosen to have 9 < V < 15, and
C7 targets were chosen to have 9 < V < 14.5, with
some exceptions to the prioritization on a campaign-
to-campaign basis, as follows: One giant with existing
RAVE data was prioritized in C4. In C6, priority was
given to 129 giants with existing APOGEE (Majewski
et al. 2010) spectra, 607 with existing RAVE spectra,

1 The 2MASS qflg photometric quality ﬂag was required to be A or
B for J, H, and Ks, which ensures, among other things, that the
signal-to-noise ratio is greater than 7. Additional ﬂags ensured
that the photometry did not suﬀer from confusion from nearby
objects (cflg == 0); was a single, unblended source (bflg == 1);
was not extended (xflg == 0); was not a known solar system
object (aflg == 0); and had no neighbors within 6” (prox >
6.0). See http:vizier.u-strasbg.frcgi-binVizieR?-source=B2mass
for more details.

2 At the time of targeting, it was typically not well-known which
stars were giants or dwarfs, but generally the giant fraction was
expected to be close to 100% at the bright end and down to as
low as 20% ,depending on the campaign, at the faint end of the
selection.

and 5 low-metallicity giants chosen from the literature
to be giants with [Fe/H]< −3. The highest priority to
GAP targets in C7 was given to 222 known giants with
existing spectroscopic data from APOGEE, and 23 tar-
gets in NGC 6717 (but see below).

Because observed targets were selected in a linear way
from the target priority list, the selection functions for
each of the campaigns are well-deﬁned. Nearly all of the
C6 targets were observed, and so the observed targets
conform to the selection function 9 < V < 15. Our C4
targets were observed down to V = 13.447, and there-
fore follow the selection function down to that magni-
tude limit (this magnitude limit approximately corre-

sponds to the top 5000 GAP targets).
these GAP-selected targets, there are fainter stars on
the GAP target list that were serendipitously observed
by K2 through other non-GAP target proposals. Those
stars do not follow the GAP selection function but are
still analyzed in this paper. However, we caution their
use for population studies. The observed C7 targets
were accidentally chosen from an inverted priority list
during the mission-wide target list consolidation before
upload to the spacecraft. As a result, only two of the
higher priority APOGEE C7 targets were observed and
none from NGC 6717. As discussed in Sharma et al.
(2019), the resulting eﬀective selection function is one
of either 9 < V < 14.5 or 14.276 < V < 14.5, de-
pending on the position on the sky. Approximately, the
3500 lowest-priority GAP targets follow the full selec-
tion function. There is, however, an additional popu-
lation of ∼ 600 stars in C7 that can be used for scien-
tiﬁc purposes, with the understanding that its selection
function of 14.276 < V < 14.5 is diﬀerent than that of
the rest of the campaign (9 < V < 14.5). For addi-
tional details, see Sharma et al. (2019). We account for
these selection functions when comparing to models in
our analysis by making sure to compare to the subset
of observed stars that follow reproducible GAP target
criteria. An accounting of observed and targeted stars
is given in Table 1. The approximate lines of sight for
these campaigns are shown in Figure 1. An on-sky map
of the campaigns is shown in Figure 2.

2.2. K2 light curve pre-processing

We used the light curves generated by the EVER-
EST pipeline (Luger et al. 2018), which uses campaign-
speciﬁc basis vectors to remove noise correlated across
pixels. Though the K2 GAP DR1 (Stello et al. 2017)
used Vanderburg & Johnson (2014) (K2SFF) light
curves, we found that the EVEREST pipeline removes
at least as much of the sawtooth-like systematic ﬂux
variation induced by the K2 six-hour thruster ﬁrings as

Note—‘K2 GAP targeted’ refers to the number of proposed targets and ‘K2 GAP
observed’ are those that were observed, including targets not following the GAP
selection function (see text). ‘GAP selected observed’ refers to the approximate
number of GAP observed stars that follow the GAP target selection function
from the bright end of V = 9 to a limiting magnitude of 13.447, 15, and 14.5
for C4, C6, and C7, respectively.

K2SFF does, while furthermore generating lower levels
of white noise in the giant spectra than K2SFF. Be-
cause the K2 GAP DR1 used K2SFF light curves, we
attempted to reconcile systematic diﬀerences in the am-
plitudes of ﬂux variations in the EVEREST and K2SFF
light curves for consistency between this release and
DR1. To do so, for each star, we multiply the EVEREST
light curve ﬂux by a scalar factor such that its power is
equal to the K2SFF power. We then applied a boxcar
high-pass ﬁlter with a width of 4 days to the light curve
to remove most of the non-oscillation variability (Stello
et al. 2015), and outliers 4σ in the time series were re-
moved. Seven targets were labeled as extended in the
EPIC, and were not included in the present analysis.3

3. METHODS

3.1. Extraction of asteroseismic parameters

In this data release, we focus on two asteroseismic

quantities, νmax and ∆ν, which we describe in turn.

The frequency at maximum acoustic power, νmax,
scales with the acoustic cutoﬀ frequency at the stellar at-
mosphere (Brown et al. 1991; Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995;
Chaplin et al. 2008; Belkacem et al. 2011), so that

from ESA/Gaia/DPAC.

The νmax,(cid:12) and ∆ν(cid:12) solar reference values are not set
in stone, and are themselves measured quantities from
asteroseismic data of the Sun. All the pipelines have
an internal set of recommended solar reference values,
νmax,(cid:12),PIP and ∆ν(cid:12),PIP. In addition to those pipeline-
speciﬁc solar reference values, we adopt a solar reference
temperature of Teﬀ,(cid:12) = 5772K (Mamajek et al. 2015).

Like Stello et al. (2017), we analyze the data using
multiple asteroseismic pipelines, whose descriptions are
found therein. We brieﬂy revisit each pipeline below.

A2Z+ (hereafter A2Z) is based on the A2Z pipeline
described in Mathur et al. (2010). ∆ν is computed using
two methods: the autocorrelation function of the time
series and the Power Spectrum of the Power Spectrum.
Then, the results from both methods are compared, and

24681012R [kpc]420246Z [kpc]SunCampaign 4Campaign 6Campaign 71050510X [kpc]1050510Y [kpc]Solar circle ~ 8 kpcG.C.a ∆ν value is only kept when both methods agree to
within 10%. The Power Density Spectra (PDS) of those
stars are checked to select the ones where modes are
present to high conﬁdence. The FliPer metric (Bugnet
et al. 2018) is used to check stars where the amplitude
of the convective background does not agree with the
seismic detection. Finally, the ∆ν value is reﬁned by
cross-correlating a template of the radial modes around
the region of the modes where ∆ν is varied. The value
reported corresponds to the one obtained for the high-
est correlation coeﬃcient. After ﬁtting the convective
background with two Harvey laws (Mathur et al. 2011;
Kallinger et al. 2014) and subtracting it from the PDS,
a Gaussian function is ﬁt to the modes to estimate the
frequency of maximum power, νmax.

BHM is based on the OCT pipeline (Hekker et al.
2010), and performs hypothesis testing for solar-like os-
cillations above the granulation background. If there is
a frequency window that has signiﬁcant signal, a νmax
and ∆ν is computed according to Hekker et al. (2010),
with increased, K2-speciﬁc quality control to ensure ∆ν
is not an alias of the true value.

CAN returns νmax and ∆ν for stars whose autocorre-
lation functions have characteristic time-scales and rms
variability that accord with a relation expected from
solar-like oscillators (Kallinger et al. 2016). A Bayesian
evidence is computed to determine whether there are
solar-like oscillations near the detected autocorrelation
time-scale (and therefore near νmax). A threshold for
the evidence is determined based on visual inspection of
a test set of power spectra. ∆ν is then calculated by
ﬁtting individual radial modes.

COR ﬁrst ﬁts for ∆ν using the autocorrelation of the
light curve. COR (Mosser & Appourchaux 2009) re-
turns results for stars that have ∆ν, FWHM, amplitude
of power, and the granulation at νmax that follow rela-
tions from Mosser et al. (2010), with stricter, K2-speciﬁc
requirements for stars with a possible νmax detected near
the K2 thruster ﬁring frequency, or alias thereof.

SYD computes νmax and ∆ν according to Huber et al.
(2009). Results are returned only for stars that are
classiﬁed as having solar-like oscillations by a machine-
learning algorithm described in Hon et al. (2018b). ∆ν
results are provided only for stars that are classiﬁed
as having reliable ∆ν values by a machine-learning al-
gorithm. The ∆ν-vetting algorithm is a convolutional
neural network trained on K2 C1 data that were classi-
ﬁed by eye as having detectable ∆ν values. The algo-
rithm takes as an input the autocorrelation of a granula-
tion background–corrected spectrum in a window with
a width of ±0.59 × ν0.9
max centered around νmax. This
latter window size is taken from the observed width

5

of detected stellar oscillations in giants (Mosser et al.
2010). The algorithm takes the autocorrelation, passes
it through a convolutional neural network, and outputs
a score varying from 0 (not a valid ∆ν detection) to 1
(100% certain valid ∆ν detection), but which is not a
linear mapping to percent conﬁdence in the detection.
For this reason, the score was calibrated using visually-
veriﬁed ∆ν detections, which showed that a score of 0.8
corresponds to a completeness of about 70% (i.e., this
score rejects 30% stars that have valid ∆ν detections)
and near total purity (i.e., all stars have visually-veriﬁed
∆ν detections); ∆ν detections were considered valid for
stars with a score above this 0.8 value.

BAM calculates νmax and ∆ν according to Zinn et al.
(2019c). ∆ν values for this data release are provided
based on the autocorrelation method described therein,
which, in turn, is based on that of SYD. Stars are classi-
ﬁed as oscillators or not based on the Bayesian evidence
for the presence of solar-like oscillations (see Zinn et al.
2019c for details), and results in this data release are
returned for stars with 3.5µHz < νmax < 250µHz. ∆ν
values are only provided for those that satisfy the SYD
∆ν-vetting algorithm described above.

Any pipeline may return a νmax and/or a ∆ν for a
given star. In what follows, however, we consider a “de-
tection” for a given pipeline to be a target for which a
νmax is returned, unless otherwise noted. A fraction of
νmax-detected stars will not have a reliable ∆ν measure-
ment reported. The raw νmax and ∆ν and the uncertain-
ties reported by each pipeline are provided in Table 2,
while the number of νmax and ∆ν values returned are
provided in Table 3.

3.2.1. Mean asteroseismic parameters, (cid:104)ν(cid:48)

max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105)

Consolidating results from multiple pipelines, as we
do here, has three primary beneﬁts: outliers can be re-
jected (e.g., stars that only one pipeline identiﬁes as an
oscillator can be considered dubious); the accuracy and
precision of the parameters can be improved by averag-
ing results for the same star from diﬀerent pipelines; and
the spread in values for a given star can be translated
into an uncertainty estimate. To perform this averag-
ing, however, the possibility that there are systematic
diﬀerences in pipeline results needs to be taken into ac-
count. Pinsonneault et al. (2018) demonstrated that
such systematics existed in their multi-pipeline analy-
sis of Kepler data, ﬁnding that the relative zero-points
of the measurements returned by diﬀerent pipelines do
not scale in the same way as their solar measurements
do Pinsonneault et al. (2018). Figures 3 & 4 demon-
strate these systematics in our K2 νmax and ∆ν values.

Figure 3. Pairwise comparisons between asteroseismology pipeline νmax values for K2 C4. The red error bars represent binned
medians and uncertainty on those binned medians. Nx and Ny indicate the number of stars with asteroseismic values returned
for pipeline x and pipeline y, with the number of stars returned by both pipelines indicated by Nxy. Trends seen here are present
in C6 and C7, as well.

In what follows, we describe an approach that re-scales
each pipeline’s νmax and ∆ν values such that they are on
average on the same scale as the other pipelines. These
rescaled values are used to perform outlier rejection with
sigma clipping, and the values are averaged for each star
to compute more accurate and precise asteroseismic val-
ues, and to deﬁne empirical uncertainties on νmax and
∆ν.

To reduce the systematic uncertainty across pipelines
for a single star, we follow the approach taken by Pin-
sonneault et al. (2018): under the assumption that each
pipeline’s νmax and ∆ν values are distributed around the

true values, we can ﬁt for near-unity scale factors that ef-
fectively modify each pipeline’s solar reference values so
that the mean νmax and ∆ν returned by pipelines are all
on the same scale. This therefore reduces the systematic
uncertainty due to the choice of a single pipeline value
on a single star’s νmax or ∆ν, and it allows for averaging
values across pipelines on a star-by-star basis.

The above procedure to re-scale the pipeline-speciﬁc
solar reference values is performed by initially as-
suming that the pipeline values are already on the
same system, so that the re-scaled νmax, ν(cid:48)
max,s,p, of
for pipeline, p, equals the raw value re-
a star, s,

max,s,p/Np is then cal-
culated for each star that has at least two pipelines
returning a value. The sum is over those Np re-
porting pipelines. A scalar factor for each pipeline,

ing the Ns stars for which the pipeline returned a raw

so that ν(cid:48)

til convergence in the re-scaled value, ν(cid:48)

procedure is done for ∆ν. Following the observation by
Pinsonneault et al. (2018) that the RC exhibits signif-
icantly diﬀerent structure in the pipeline νmax and ∆ν
zero-point diﬀerences, the same procedure is done for
RGB & RGB/AGB stars and RC stars, separately. In
the end, four scale factors are derived for each pipeline:
a νmax scale factor for RGB stars; a ∆ν scale factor for
RGB stars; a νmax scale factor for RC stars; and a ∆ν
scale factor for RC stars. The resulting factors are at
the per cent level or below. For each pipeline, we pro-

Unless otherwise noted, the mean ∆ν values for each
star, (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105), as well as the pipeline-speciﬁc re-scaled ∆ν
values, ∆ν(cid:48), have been multiplied by a factor as de-
scribed in Sharma et al. (2016) that depends on the
star’s temperature, metallicity, surface gravity, mass,
and evolutionary state. This factor is provided in Ta-
ble 4 as XSharma, and is a theoretically-motivated fac-
tor that improves the homology assumption in the ∆ν
scaling relation (Equation 2). We calculated these fac-
tors using temperatures and metallicities from the EPIC
(Huber et al. 2016); surface gravity from Equation 1 us-
ing νmax; mass estimates from Equation 6 using νmax
and ∆ν, before the factor in question has been applied;
and evolutionary states derived from the neural network
approach laid out in §3.2.2. The correction is applied
multiplicatively such that ∆ν(cid:48) is multiplied by XSharma.
Pipeline values rejected by the above sigma-clipping pro-
cess will not have a corrected pipeline value populated
in Table 4.

Table 5 shows the resulting solar reference scale fac-
tors compared to those from Pinsonneault et al. (2018).
The agreement is mixed, depending on the pipeline. As
noted in §3.1, the pipelines as implemented for this anal-
ysis have been modiﬁed to account for K2 data, and so
may well diﬀer slightly in the way they perform com-
pared to their implementation for Pinsonneault et al.
(2018). Additionally, we consider results from BAM

(Zinn et al. 2019c), which was not considered for the
Pinsonneault et al. (2018) analysis. The uncertainties on
the scale factors derived in this work are also larger than
the ones found by Pinsonneault et al. (2018), in part
due to the increased scatter in the νmax and ∆ν derived
with K2 data compared to Kepler data. These uncer-
tainties are calculated assuming σνmax and σ∆ν are exact
(i.e., with no uncertainty on the standard deviation used
to calculate them [see §3.2.3]). Given this assumption,
the uncertainties on the scale factors are indicative and
not deﬁnitive. We also provide the re-scaled, pipeline-
speciﬁc solar reference values themselves in Table 5 (at-
tained by multiplying the pipeline-speciﬁc solar refer-
ence value by the pipeline’s solar reference scale factor
derived here).

Even with these re-scalings, residual diﬀerences be-
tween pipelines as a function of νmax and ∆ν will re-
main. These trends are shown in the bottom panels
of Figures 6 - 9, where fractional diﬀerences between
max(cid:105) & (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) and individual pipeline re-scaled val-
(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
ues, ν(cid:48)
max & ∆ν(cid:48) are shown. By deﬁnition, the mean of
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105),
max and ∆ν(cid:48) across the pipelines are (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
ν(cid:48)
though what these ﬁgures demonstrate is sub-structure
as a function of νmax and ∆ν, indicating νmax- and ∆ν-
dependent systematic errors, not zero-point errors. We
turn to a more robust estimate of the systematic errors
on (cid:104)ν(cid:48)

max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) in §4.2.

After these re-scalings are applied for each pipeline
νmax and ∆ν, the absolute value of the solar refer-
ence values are free to be chosen, which we take to be
νmax,(cid:12) = 3076µHz and ∆ν(cid:12) = 135.146µHz (Pinson-
neault et al. 2018). The eﬀect of this choice is evaluated
in § 4.2.

The main K2 GAP DR2 sample is deﬁned to be that
with a valid (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) (i.e., stars for which at
least two pipelines returned both νmax and ∆ν that
agree to within 3σ), and its contents are summarized
in Table 4. The sample contains 4395 stars.

3.2.2. Evolutionary states

Recent results have shown that highly accurate evolu-
tionary state classiﬁcation between RGB and RC can be
achieved even on short (K2 -like) time series using ma-
chine learning approaches (Hon et al. 2017, 2018a; Kus-
zlewicz et al. 2020) where ‘classical’ asteroseismic-based
classiﬁcation is not possible (Bedding et al. 2011; Mosser
et al. 2019; Elsworth et al. 2019). We note also that de-
termining evolutionary state for short times series may
be possible by measuring (cid:15)c, the radial order position
for the central radial mode of a power spectrum, to the
extent that mode identiﬁcation is possible with K2 light
curves; see Kallinger et al. (2012). In this work, we de-

termine evolutionary state using the method described
in Hon et al. (2017, 2018a), which has a similar accu-
racy to that of the recent machine learning approach
from Kuszlewicz et al. (2020) (95% and 91% for K2 -like
data, respectively). The chosen technique requires that
the granulation background of the stellar power spec-
trum be removed, and that νmax and ∆ν be provided
in order to search the appropriate part of the spectrum
for evolutionary state diagnostics. We remove the back-
ground by subtracting a smoothed version of each power
spectrum in log space. This approach avoids removing

low-frequency modes, as can happen when smoothing
with a window with ﬁxed size in linear frequency, by
using the fact that solar-like oscillators with diﬀerent
νmax have similar granulation background shapes in log
space. We then apply the machine-learning technique
from Hon et al. (2017, 2018a) using the background-
subtracted power spectrum, (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105), and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) as in-
puts. For details on how the neural network is trained,
including how the probability of being RGB or RC is cal-
ibrated, see Hon et al. (2017, 2018a). Because the ma-
chine learning algorithm was not trained on stars with

10

∆ν < 3.2µHz (corresponding to stars with radii larger
than those in the RC), we assign stars in this ∆ν regime
to be ambiguous RGB/AGB stars. The spectra of these
stars from K2 cannot be used to distinguish between
RGB and AGB because both types of stars are shell
burning stars, and so we consider them for the purposes
of the following analysis to be equivalent to RGB stars.

The root mean square of the re-scaled ν(cid:48)

max and ∆ν(cid:48)
values for each star across pipelines can be thought of
as — and in this work are taken to be — the statisti-
cal uncertainties on (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105)
and σ(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105). These values are listed in Table 4. We
compare σ(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and σ(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) to the reported statisti-
cal uncertainties on the parameters returned by each
pipeline in the bottom panels of Figures 6 - 9. These
panels show the fractional diﬀerences in the pipeline-
reported uncertainty and the root mean square of ν(cid:48)
max
and ∆ν(cid:48) across pipelines, and indicates whether or not
the pipeline values are over- (above the grey dashed
line) or under-estimated (below the grey dashed line),
assuming the pipeline values are distributed like normal
variables around (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105). The uncertainties
in νmax and ∆ν appear to be over-estimated for stars
max(cid:105) and σ(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105). This over-estimation
with smaller σ(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
worsens with decreasing σ(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and σ(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105), and does
so more rapidly for RC stars than RGB stars. Part of
this over-estimation trend may well be a selection eﬀect:
σ(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and σ(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) are computed after a sigma-clipping
procedure, which will tend to make a smaller root mean
square. We evaluate the accuracy of these uncertainties
further in §3.3.

It is our wish not to impose a choice of temperature on
the user when providing asteroseismic radii and masses,

which is why we provide κR and κM instead of direct
radius and mass. With the re-scaled asteroseismic val-
max and ∆ν(cid:48), in hand, we can construct the radius
ues, ν(cid:48)
and mass coeﬃcients, κ(cid:48)
R and κ(cid:48)
M for each star and each
pipeline, which correspond to the asteroseismic compo-
nent of the scaling relations for stellar mass and radius in
solar units. We show the pairwise comparisons between
pipeline values of κ(cid:48)
M for all stars in the DR2
sample in Figures 10 & 11. As with the pairwise νmax
and ∆ν comparisons (Figures 3 & 4), we see systematic
diﬀerences between pipeline κ(cid:48)
M values, which
we quantify in §3.4. We also construct the average for
each star, (cid:104)κ(cid:48)

a function of evolutionary state (RGB or RGB/AGB,
RC). The curves over-plotted on the distributions rep-
resent models of the uncertainty distributions assum-
ing Gaussian statistics. Under the assumption that all
stars in K2 have the same, true fractional uncertainty,
σ, these distributions would be described by general-
ized gamma distributions with probability density func-
tion f (x, a, d, p) = (p/ad)xd−1e−(x/a)p
, where Γ(z) de-
notes the gamma function, p = 2, d = dof − 1, and
a = (cid:112)2σ2/(dof − 1). We consider two models: one
with σ ﬁxed to be the observed median fractional un-
certainty for each dof , and one with two generalized
gamma distributions for which both σ and dof are al-
lowed to vary. The grey (black) curves in Figures 20-21
are weighted sums of the best-ﬁtting single-component
(two-component) models across all dof (see the Ap-
It is clear that the observed dis-
pendix for details).
max(cid:105) and σ(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105)/(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) are not
tributions of σ(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
perfectly described by a generalized gamma distribution
with a unique σ, as they would be if all stars had the
same fractional uncertainty in (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105). Nev-
ertheless, allowing σ to be a function of the number of
reporting pipelines appears to be a surprisingly good
approximation. This indicates that 1) the fractional
uncertainties for all stars are not a strong function of
νmax or ∆ν (but rather have a fractional uncertainty
that varies modestly according to the number of report-
ing pipelines), and 2) our uncertainty estimates are dis-
tributed like they should be according to χ statistics.
As we note in the Appendix, the fractional uncertainties
vary mostly according to the evolutionary state, with RC

parameters less precisely measured, and it happens that
the typical uncertainties are the same for νmax and ∆ν
for RGB stars. Our typical uncertainties for (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and
(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) are listed in Table 7, along with the correspond-
ing median fractional uncertainties from APOKASC-2
(Pinsonneault et al. 2018) (“APOKASC-2” in the ta-
ble). We also include a comparison to the median frac-
tional uncertainties from the analysis of Yu et al. (2018)
(“Y18” in the table). The latter analysis uses only the
SYD pipeline, as opposed to APOKASC-2, which re-
ports parameters averaged across ﬁve diﬀerent astero-
seismic pipelines. The methodology in this work is much
the same as that of Pinsonneault et al. (2018), but we
include a comparison to Yu et al. (2018) to give an indi-
cation of the variation in uncertainties resulting from an

aggregated pipeline versus individual pipeline approach.
The most signiﬁcance diﬀerence between the uncertain-
ties of the two Kepler analyses is in RC νmax, for which
uncertainties from Yu et al. (2018) are larger than those
from APOKASC-2; the larger νmax uncertainties from
Yu et al. (2018) map into correspondingly larger RC κR
and κM uncertainties. Comparing our results to those
of APOKASC-2, we see that the uncertainties in νmax
in K2 are up to a factor of two larger than in Kepler,
and the uncertainties in ∆ν are larger by up to a factor
of four for RGB stars. These diﬀerences between Kepler
and K2 come from diﬀerences in photometric precision
and the diﬀerences in dwell time, and will be further
explored in the next K2 GAP data release.

R(cid:105) and (cid:104)κ(cid:48)

The analogous uncertainty distributions for (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
R(cid:105) and
(cid:104)κ(cid:48)
M (cid:105) are shown in Figures 22-23. Note that the num-
ber of stars plotted, N , is not 4395 (the total number of
stars we provide with (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
M (cid:105)). This is because
in this treatment, we require the number of pipelines re-
porting values for νmax and ∆ν be the same in order to
fulﬁll the generalized gamma distribution requirements;
most stars do not have the same number of νmax mea-
surements as ∆ν: there are 1030 such RGB stars and
257 such RC stars. Considering the excellent match
of the ﬁtted generalized gamma distributions (black),
we adopt statistical uncertainties for (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
M (cid:105) as
listed in Table 7. We also list the corresponding me-
dian fractional uncertainties in Kepler, computed using
the evolutionary states and νmax & ∆ν values from Pin-
sonneault et al. (2018) (“APOKASC-2”) or those from
Yu et al. (2018) (“Y18”). We ﬁnd that the K2 radius
(mass) uncertainties are larger by up to a factor of three
(two) compared to that of Kepler for RGB stars from
APOKASC-2. The uncertainties in RC stellar param-
eters are more comparable between the two data sets,
with the increase in uncertainty from Kepler to K2 not
being larger than a factor of two. The uncertainties are
more comparable between Yu et al. (2018) results and
K2 because of the larger uncertainty in RC νmax from
Yu et al. (2018) compared to APOKASC-2.

and (cid:104)κ(cid:48)

M (cid:105)

R(cid:105), and (cid:104)κ(cid:48)

We now turn to systematic uncertainties in (cid:104)ν(cid:48)

max(cid:105),
(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105), (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
M (cid:105) that take the form of νmax- and
∆ν-dependent oﬀsets among the pipelines. By deﬁni-
tion, the rescaling process described in §3.2.1 removes
oﬀsets among the pipelines by averaging over all νmax
and ∆ν. However, there are νmax- and ∆ν-dependent
trends seen in the fractional diﬀerences in (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and
(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) shown in Figures 6 - 9. These trends do not aﬀect
the statistical uncertainty discussion above, as they are
removed when computing σ(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and σ(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105). Our ap-
proach to account for these systematics is therefore to
adopt the largest excursion of any pipeline from (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105)
and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) for each bin plotted in the bottom panel of
Figures 6 - 9, add to that the uncertainty on the me-
dian, and adopting the result as 2σ systematic uncer-
tainties. The resulting (1σ) uncertainties are listed in
Table 8. For most stars, the typical systematic uncer-
tainty is less than the statistical uncertainty: for a typi-
cal RGB star with (νmax, ∆ν) ∼ (75µHz, 7.5µHz) or RC
star with (νmax, ∆ν) ∼ (30µHz, 4.0µHz), the system-
atic uncertainties are similar, at ∼ 0.6% in (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and
∼ 0.3% in (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105). We adopt these numbers as typical
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105), though
systematic uncertainties for (cid:104)ν(cid:48)

R(cid:105) and (cid:104)κ(cid:48)

R(cid:105) and (cid:104)κ(cid:48)

R(cid:105) and (cid:104)κ(cid:48)

they are clearly a function of νmax and ∆ν. Generally,
though, the uncertainty is larger at smaller νmax and ∆ν.
This is a result of both intrinsically fewer stars in this
regime (as they are more evolved, and therefore shorter-
lived) as well as diﬃculties in measuring low-frequency
νmax and ∆ν due to the K2 frequency resolution. We
take the systematic uncertainties in (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
M (cid:105) to be
1% and 2%, from propagation of the systematic uncer-
tainties in (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105),
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105). As with (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
in detail, these systematic uncertainties are a function
of (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
M (cid:105) (see Figures 10 & 11).
We note that the ∆ν correction applied to (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) and
therefore (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
M (cid:105), XSharma, is computed using
the EPIC temperature and metallicity scale. We ac-
knowledge the user may wish to use their own temper-
atures, and therefore we caution that using a diﬀerent
temperature scale will introduce systematics. For ex-
ample, using a temperature scale 100K hotter (cooler)
than the EPIC temperature will make radii 1% lower
(higher) if XSharma is not also recomputed with the
user’s adopted temperatures. In order to give the user
as much convenience as possible, we provide EPIC tem-
peratures in Table 4, should the user wish to compute
consistent radii/masses; we also include the EPIC metal-
licities used for computing XSharma.
In the event the
user wishes to use a diﬀerent temperature scale and
does not wish to sustain additional ∼ 1% systematic
uncertainties, we encourage re-computing XSharma with
the user’s own temperatures and/or metallicities using
asfgrid (Sharma et al. 2016; Sharma & Stello 2016),
which is available at http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/
k2gap/Asfgrid/.

4. RESULTS

4.1. Comparison to Galaxia

We start by comparing properties of the K2 GAP DR2
sample to those of a Galaxia simulation (Sharma et al.
2011), with corrections made to the simulated metal-
licity scale described in Sharma et al. (2019). Each
campaign has been modeled separately because they
each probe diﬀerent regions of the Galaxy. To make
the simulated populations comparable to the data, we
select only the simulated stars that would be seismi-
cally detected. We deﬁned the detectable sample to
be stars with 3µHz < νmax < 280µHz and signal-to-
noise ratio yielding a probability of detection greater
than 95% (calculated according to the procedure used
in Chaplin et al. (2011)). We impose the same se-
lection of the simulated and observed stars (see §2.1
and also Sharma et al. 2019), using a synthetic V -band
magnitude that depends on J − Ks color according to

R values.

V = Ks + 2.0((J − Ks) + 0.14) + 0.382e2(J−Ks−0.2)
(Sharma et al. 2018).

Galaxia models of the magnitude-νmax distributions
show good agreement with the observations, as shown
in Figures 12–14. The most obvious feature in these
plots is the RC, which, because red giants spend a rel-
atively long amount of time in this phase, results in
a “clump” of stars at νmax ∼ 30µHz. Lower-gravity
(lower-νmax) red giants oscillate with larger power than

higher-gravity red giants, and so at a ﬁxed magnitude,
it is easier to measure oscillations in lower-gravity red
giants. The amplitude of oscillations is primarily a
function of surface gravity (Kallinger et al. 2014), and
so the diagonal cutoﬀ in the top right corner of both
Galaxia predictions and (for the most part) observa-
tions is a result of the signal-to-noise ratio from the sur-
face gravity–dependent oscillation amplitude compared
to the magnitude-dependent white noise. To demon-

strate this νmax-dependent white noise limit, we assume
a detectability threshold of νmax,detect < 5 × 1041.6−H
in Figures 12–14 (dashed lines). This detectability
threshold describes the observed data well, and scales
like a ﬂux-dependent white noise would.
In Kp-band
space, this threshold would mean a detectability limit
of Kp ≈ 15, fainter than which the white noise is too
large to detect high-νmax oscillators. Compared to the
detectability threshold of C1 described in Stello et al.

(2017), the dependence on magnitude is less steep, and
likely reﬂects the improved noise qualities following im-
proved pointing control starting with C3. The reason
the faint and bright limits do not form straight, vertical
trends in Figures 12–14, which show H-band, is because
we selected stars in V -band (see §2.1). For convenience,
we also show the detection distributions as a function of
only H-band magnitude in Figure 15.

We condense the comparison between observed and
simulated asteroseismic values to just the νmax dimen-
sion for C4 and C7 in Figures 16 & 17. The agreement
is generally good. There are two main discrepancies,
however. First, the number of predicted oscillators in
C4 does not agree with the observations (Figure 16a).
However, plotting the normalized distribution such that
each bin is divided by the bin size (representing proba-
bility density) results in agreement, except for the low-
νmax regime (Figure 16b). We discuss the discrepancy in
Figure 16a below. Second, there are fewer observed low
νmax stars (νmax (cid:46) 10 − 20µHz) than predicted in both
C4 and C7. Although Stello et al. (2017) found this same
bias in K2 GAP DR1, we attempt to verify that it is not
due to a bias in the Galaxia models themselves by man-
ually inspecting all K2 GAP spectra in C6 for evidence of
solar-like oscillations. Two experts did the exercise sep-
arately, classifying the K2 spectra according to whether
or not they had a detectable νmax (yes/maybe/no), ad-
ditionally assigning a visual estimate of νmax. Objects
that showed evidence of solar-like oscillations below the
eﬀective high-pass cutoﬀ of 3µHz were classiﬁed as no.
Note that this exercise did not require the detection of

∆ν for classiﬁcation as a solar-like oscillator, which is
consistent with our deﬁnition of a pipeline detection as
a valid νmax measurement (see §3.1). The results from
each person were nearly identical, with any contested
classiﬁcations discussed individually and a ﬁnal consen-
sus classiﬁcation agreed upon.

As evident in Figure 18, the predicted νmax distribu-
tion from Galaxia is in good agreement with the vi-
sually conﬁrmed distribution (“yes”s are plotted, not
“maybe”s), though they are formally inconsistent with
being drawn from the same distribution, according to
a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. By going through all of
the observed targets by eye and not just ones that were
returned by pipelines as being red giants, we are able
to be more conﬁdent that the Galaxia predictions are
robust and not subject to obvious biases. The dis-
tributions of νmax returned by individual pipelines all
fall short of being formally consistent with either the
visually-conﬁrmed distribution or the Galaxia distri-
bution, though some of the pipeline νmax distributions
qualitatively show good agreement with the predicted
and visually-conﬁrmed distributions.

Figure 13. Distributions of νmax as a function of magnitude, as predicted by Galaxia (black) and observed (green), for K2 C6.
The dashed lines represent our adopted detectability threshold of νmax,detect < 5 × 1041.6−H .

As noted above, there is nonetheless a bias against
detecting stars with νmax, below ∼ 10 − 20µHz. This
is true for all three of the campaigns, which indicates
that this detection bias was not solely a function of the
particular DR1 sample, which were all in C1. With the
data we have in hand, we cannot deﬁnitively say what
causes this bias. At these low frequencies, there are rela-
tively few modes observable. This may hinder detecting
these oscillations for pipelines that rely on ﬁnding ∆ν
as part of its νmax detection step, and can also hamper
ﬁts to the power excess using a Gaussian since a Gaus-
sian does not very well describe a few discrete modes.
It is also possible that low-νmax oscillators are harder
to recover at lower frequencies because of the relatively
short K2 dwell time, which leads to a smaller ratio of
the frequency resolution to the mode width; the result is
that the spectra of these stars can sometimes be hard to
distinguish from a pure granulation background. The
degree to which these oscillators are detected or not
is highly pipeline-dependent, as one can see from Fig-
ures 16-18.

Keeping this low-νmax detection bias in mind, we can
go on to test the detection rate for νmax > 20µHz, using

Galaxia and visual inspection as ground truths. In C7,
there are 1740 such stars that have asteroseismic values
from at least one pipeline. This number is consistent
with the 1758 expected stars from the Galaxia simu-
lation for C7. The 2312 stars recovered by at least one
pipeline in C6 is between the number found by visual in-
spection, 2214, and that predicted by Galaxia, 2511. In
C4, however, there are signiﬁcantly fewer stars observed
by at least one pipeline than predicted by Galaxia (2177
versus 2670). These ‘missing’ stars are at magnitudes
Kp < 13, and therefore should yield observable aster-
oseismic parameters, given our empirical detectability
threshold. The Galaxia model seems to under-predict
reddening in this campaign, which may explain this dis-
crepancy. Indeed, the predicted fraction of dwarfs (and
therefore the fraction of stars that would not be detected
as oscillators in long-cadence K2 data) depends on the
assumed reddening. For K2 GAP, the selection ‘draws
a line’ in J − Ks color space to separate the sample of
predominantly blue dwarfs from the sample containing
the red giants (and some red dwarfs), which are the tar-
gets with J − Ks > 0.5. The same cut is applied to the
synthetic stellar population in the Galaxia simulation,

using an assumed reddening. An under-estimated red-
dening in Galaxia means that fewer of the blue dwarfs
are reddened enough to fall on the giant side of the
J − Ks > 0.5 dwarf/giant dividing line, increasing the
number of predicted oscillators compared to reality.

4.2. Absolute radius calibration

The derived (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) and (cid:104)ν(cid:48)

max(cid:105) have not necessarily
been placed on an absolute scale. While we scaled the
asteroseismic values to a common mean scale, we were
free to impose solar reference values for (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105)
to be νmax,(cid:12) = 3076µHz and ∆ν(cid:12) = 135.146µHz, which
are relatively close to the average pipeline-speciﬁc solar
reference values, and which are the same as determined
by the absolute asteroseismology re-scaling done in the
APOKASC-2 analysis. Were we working with Kepler
data and using the same pipelines as in the APOKASC-
2 analysis, this choice of solar reference values would be
valid and would put the asteroseismic radii on a scale
that is consistent with open cluster masses and Gaia
radii (Pinsonneault et al. 2018; Zinn et al. 2019b). There
are at least two reasons why choosing our solar reference
values as νmax,(cid:12) = 3076µHz and ∆ν(cid:12) = 135.146µHz

R(cid:105) and (cid:104)κ(cid:48)

may not result in (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
M (cid:105) being on an absolute
scale. First, although our re-scaling procedure to de-
rive (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) and (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) is nearly the same as in Pinson-
neault et al. (2018), we have added BAM as one of the
pipelines that contributes to the re-scaling procedure:
APOKASC-2 used results from A2Z, CAN, COR, SYD,
and OCT, and in this work, we have used results from
A2Z, CAN, COR, SYD, BHM (based on OCT), and
BAM (see §3.1 for summaries of the pipeline methodolo-
gies). The addition of BAM in this work to the pipelines
used for aggregating asteroseismic results may result in a
slightly diﬀerent mean scale for (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105). This
is because the APOAKSC-2 solar reference values were
chosen such that the aggregated stellar masses agreed
with open cluster masses — using a diﬀerent set of
pipelines to average over may have required a diﬀerent
set of solar reference values to achieve agreement with
open cluster masses. We see this in the diﬀerences be-
tween the re-scaling values from our analysis and from
that of Pinsonneault et al. (2018), shown in Table 5.
Second, there is evidence to suggest that there are sys-
tematic biases in asteroseismic parameters based on the
dwell time of the data (Zinn et al., in prep.), which could

18

be suggestive of a need to modify the νmax,(cid:12) and/or ∆ν(cid:12)
for K2 data compared to Kepler data. We now test this
choice of zero-points by comparing the derived radii to
radii using parallaxes from Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia
Collaboration et al. 2018; Lindegren et al. 2018).

We populated the overlap sample of stars in K2 GAP
DR2 with both (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) and (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and Gaia DR2 by
matching on 2MASS ID using the Gaia Archive4. We
also required APOGEE metallicities and temperatures
from DR16 (Ahumada et al. 2020). Because of a known,
position, magnitude, and color-dependent zero-point in
the Gaia parallaxes (e.g., Lindegren et al. 2018; Zinn
et al. 2019a), we did not work directly with the Gaia
DR2 parallaxes. Instead, we followed the methodology
of Sch¨onrich et al. (2019) to derive distance estimates
for stars in our K2 GAP sample. We did this sepa-
rately for RC and RGB stars, with the understanding
that RGB and RC populations will have diﬀerent selec-
tion functions, which is an important consideration in
the Bayesian distance estimates in the Sch¨onrich et al.
(2019) framework (see also Sch¨onrich & Aumer 2017).

For the purposes of establishing a Gaia calibration of
νmax,(cid:12) and ∆ν(cid:12), we used only stars with more than two
pipelines returning results for ∆ν, and only considered
stars with π > 0.4 and Gaia G-band < 13mag to en-
sure that the results are less sensitive to any residual
Gaia parallax zero-points that may not be accounted
for in the Sch¨onrich et al. (2019) method; [Fe/H]> −1
to ensure that there are no metallicity-dependent aster-
oseismic radius systematics (see Zinn et al. 2019b); and
R < 30R(cid:12) to ensure there are no radius-dependent as-
teroseismic radius systematics (see Zinn et al. 2019b).
For this sample, which has spectroscopic information,
we re-compute ∆ν correction factors using metallicities
that are adjusted to account for non-solar alpha abun-
dances according to the Salaris et al. (1993) prescrip-
tion: [Fe/H](cid:48) = [Fe/H] + log10(0.638 × 10[α/M] + 0.362).
We computed a Gaia radius for the 261 resulting stars
following a Monte Carlo procedure of the sort detailed
in Zinn et al. (2017). The method uses the Stefan-
Boltzmann law to translate the ﬂux, temperature, and
distance of a star into a radius. To do so, we computed
bolometric ﬂuxes with a Ks-band bolometric correction
(Gonz´alez Hern´andez & Bonifacio 2009), APOGEE ef-
fective temperatures, and metallicities, combined with
asteroseismic surface gravities from (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105). Extinctions
were computed using the three-dimensional dust map of
Green et al. (2015), as implemented in mwdust5 (Bovy

5 https://github.com/jobovy/mwdust

et al. 2016). Five stars with asteroseismic and Gaia radii
discrepant at more than the 3σ level were removed from
subsequent analysis.

We compare the Gaia radius scale to our K2 astero-
seismic radius scale in Figure 19. The top panel shows
the points colored by evolutionary state (RGB in red
and RC in blue), and the bottom panels shows the frac-
tional agreement of the two radius scales. Figure 19 indi-
cates that the radius scale of (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
R(cid:105) is consistent with the
Gaia radius scale for both RC and RGB stars to within
∼ 3%. We ﬁnd that the RGB stars are in more disagree-
ment than the RC stars: while the median agreement is
3.0%±0.4% for RGB stars, it is 1.6%±0.8% for RC stars.
This median statistic is computed as the median radius
ratio for all RGB or RC stars, with the uncertainty in

extinctions instead of those from Green et al. (2015)
leads to insigniﬁcant variations in the radius agreement.
However, the agreement is discrepant at the ∼ 3σ level
between stars in C4 versus those in C7. This could be
an indication of Gaia parallax zero-point issues, given
we do not expect such variations in the asteroseismic
data by campaign. We therefore also consider the Gaia
zero-point from Khan et al. (2019), who compared aster-
oseismic distances to Gaia distances in K2 C3 and C6.
For this exercise, we restricted our sample to the stars
in C6, and adopted their derived zero-point of −17µas.
The result is that the asteroseismic radii are consistent
with Gaia radii to within ≈ 1% (RGB) and ≈ 5% (RC).

those stars that have fractional parallax uncertainties
less than 10%,
in order to mitigate potential biases
due to parallax systematics. According to this metric,
the agreement becomes 2.2 ± 0.3% for RGB stars and
2.0 ± 0.6% for RC stars.

Due to the variation in this agreement based on the
tests described above, we opt not to re-scale our (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105)
or (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) values, and instead allow for a systematic zero-
point uncertainty in our derived (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
R(cid:105) values. Acknowl-
edging these uncertainties in the K2 -Gaia agreement,
we use the weighted mean estimate of the radius scales
using the Sch¨onrich et al. (2019) Gaia distances. Our
asteroseismic radius coeﬃcients could therefore be over-

estimated by up to 2.2 ± 0.3% for RGB stars and up
to 2.0 ± 0.6% for RC stars. The uncertainty on this
agreement is solely due to the standard uncertainty on
the mean, and does not account for intrinsic scatter or
trends in the radius agreement. Indeed, this should be
thought of as being in addition to the systematic un-
certainty from pipeline-to-pipeline variation in (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
R(cid:105) as
a function of νmax and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) discussed in §3.4. We also
note that this agreement does not account for systematic
variation in the radius ratio due to choice of tempera-
ture, bolometric correction, or Gaia zero-point, which
may contribute to a systematic uncertainty of about
±2% (Zinn et al. 2019b).

Broadly speaking, the excellent level of agreement
between asteroseismology and Gaia corroborates ﬁnd-
ings of the accuracy of the scaling relations in this
regime from previous work based on asteroseismology-
Gaia comparisons (Huber et al. 2017; Zinn et al. 2019b).
In detail, there do appear to be trends with radius evi-
dent in Figure 19: the RGB radii appear to inﬂate com-
pared to Gaia radii at around R ∼ 7.5R(cid:12) (red error
bars), while the red clump radii (blue error bars) seem
to deﬂate compared to the Gaia radii with increasing
radius at all radii. At least for the RC stars, system-
atics in the tracks used to generate the ∆ν corrections
could be to blame, particularly given the disagreement
among RC models from the literature (An et al. 2019).
Indeed, it appears that the RC radius trend is mostly a
trend in ∆ν, with some metallicity dependence, as well.
At the population level, the RC radii have been found
to agree within 5% with Gaia radii (Hall et al. 2019).
However, to our knowledge, the scaling relations for RC
stars have not been tested as a function of radius as we
do here. We note also that a ≈ 1% relative diﬀerence
between the zero-point for RGB versus RC stars is not
ruled out by Pinsonneault et al. (2018) (see also Khan
et al. 2019).

Regarding the mean agreement of RGB and RC stars,
the most likely culprit for the (small) radius disagree-
ment is a systematic in the solar reference value com-
bination νmax,(cid:12)/∆ν2
(cid:12). That the absolute K2 astero-
seismic radius scale is consistent to within ∼ 2% with
the Gaia radius scale naively implies that our (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
M (cid:105) are
within ∼ 6% of an absolute mass scale, according to
standard propagation of error from Equation 4 to 6.
However, this is only approximate, because we can test
only νmax,(cid:12)/∆ν2
(cid:12) against Gaia, whereas the mass coef-
max,(cid:12)/∆ν4
ﬁcient goes as ν3
(cid:12).

In summary, because we are delivering asteroseismic
values (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) that are averaged values from
several pipelines, we needed to evaluate to what extent
the resulting asteroseismic scale is on an absolute scale.

19

We did this by comparing to Gaia radii, and we found a
systematic oﬀset between the K2 GAP DR2 asteroseis-
mic and Gaia radius scales of about 2%. This translates
roughly to a 20% systematic uncertainty in age. Given
the typical uncertainty in mass listed in Table 7, ages
based on our RGB asteroseismic masses would be ex-
pected to have statistical uncertainties of ≈ 20%, with
potential scale shifts by ≈ 20% due to the level of sys-
tematics we identify in this section. This anticipated
20% statistical age uncertainty makes the data particu-
larly interesting for potentially identifying the history of
minor mergers in the Galaxy based on their impact on
the age–velocity dispersion relation (Martig et al. 2014).
For this and other Galactic archaeology applications
(e.g., age-abundance patterns), the 20% systematic un-
certainty should not be signiﬁcant, given that the diﬀer-
ential age relationship between stellar populations would
be preserved. Regarding mass- or magnitude-dependent
systematics among RGB asteroseismic parameters, the
small inﬂation of RGB asteroseismic radii at R ∼ 7.5R(cid:12)
seems to map onto a corresponding trend in νmax, and so
this may introduce an inﬂation in the RGB mass scale
by perhaps up to 15% for the minority of stars with
max(cid:105) (cid:46) 80µHz. RC stars in our sample,
50µHz (cid:46) (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
on the other hand, appear to suﬀer from strong radius-
dependent trends that seem to be related to the ∆ν and
not νmax scaling relation: there is a strong trend of RC
agreement with ∆ν, which suggests that the ∆ν scaling
relation for RC stars is not well-calibrated using our ∆ν
corrections. Despite the concerning magnitude of the
RC systematic, RC ages are not in popular use because
of uncertainties in modeling mass loss (Casagrande et al.
2016). We will nonetheless explore the RC systematic
further in the next and ﬁnal K2 GAP data release, as
having accurate red clump masses and radii is impor-
tant for reckoning red clump models with observed red
clump properties (e.g., An et al. 2019).

5. CONCLUSION

We have described the second data release of K2 GAP,
containing red giants for campaigns 4, 6, and 7. We
have derived evolutionary state classiﬁcations for our
sample, and have placed the raw asteroseismic obser-
vations on a self-consistent scale, resulting in 4395 stars
with mean asteroseismic parameters. We have also pro-
vided ready-to-use derived quantities, (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
R(cid:105),
for these stars, which yield masses and radii when com-
bined with a weakly temperature-dependent factor that
users may compute with their preferred eﬀective tem-
perature. We conclude the following:

M (cid:105) and (cid:104)κ(cid:48)

1. The observed K2 GAP targets in campaigns 4, 6,
and 7 have reproducible selection functions, which

Future work will focus on calibrating the mass coeﬃ-
cients, which at this point cannot be deﬁnitively placed
on an absolute scale, for lack of convenient mass calibra-
tors in the sample. In the next K2 GAP data release,
we may be able to place masses on an absolute scale, as
we have done for radii in this work, by appealing to the
red giant branch mass of open clusters observed by K2.

20

enable them for use in Galactic archaeology stud-
ies.

2. νmax- and ∆ν- dependent trends among pipelines
have been improved by bringing the pipelines onto
a common scale. This re-scaling process eﬀectively
changes pipeline-speciﬁc solar reference values at
or below the 1% level, in diﬀerent measures, de-
pending on the pipeline and the evolutionary state
of the star.

3. We provide empirical uncertainties in νmax and ∆ν
values for stars that have results from at least two
pipelines, which have statistically reasonable dis-
tributions, and which indicate that fractional un-
certainties are not strong functions of νmax or ∆ν
or the number of pipelines reporting, but rather
vary mostly according to evolutionary state: RGB
stars have better-measured parameters than do
RC stars. Systematic uncertainties for νmax and
∆ν values are similar across evolutionary state, at
∼ 0.6% and ∼ 0.3% for both RGB and RC stars.

4. The distributions of our mean νmax are in good
agreement with those predicted by theoretical
stellar population synthesis models. Crucially,
both the observed and predicted νmax distribu-
tions globally agree with an unbiased estimate of
the νmax distributions from manual inspection of
the data, which indicates our model predictions
are accurate, and our observed samples are largely
complete. A notable exception to the asteroseis-
mic detection completeness is for red giants with
νmax (cid:46) 10 − 20µHz, where pipelines may report
lower-than-expected numbers of oscillating stars.

5. The radius and mass coeﬃcients that we pro-
vide, (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
M (cid:105), have typical uncertain-

M (cid:105) = 7.7% (RGB or
RGB/AGB) & σ(cid:104)κ(cid:48)
M (cid:105) = 10.5% (RC). These uncer-
tainties are a factor of two to three higher than
the uncertainties from Kepler radii and masses.

R(cid:105) = 5.0% (RC) and σ(cid:104)κ(cid:48)

6. Our asteroseismic radii have been validated to be
on the Gaia radius scale, to within 2.2 ± 0.3% for
RGB stars and 2.0% ± 0.6% for RC stars.

K2 GAP Data Release 2 successfully builds upon
K2 GAP DR1 in providing evolutionary state informa-
tion; re-scaled asteroseismic parameters and uncertain-
ties that take advantage of the information from multi-
ple asteroseismic pipelines; radius and mass coeﬃcients;
and placing the radius coeﬃcients on an absolute scale.

max(cid:105)/(cid:104)ν(cid:48)

We model the distribution of the fractional uncertainties, σ(cid:104)ν(cid:48)

max(cid:105) and σ(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105)/(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) as a function of the
number of pipelines used to compute the uncertainties, dof , and evolutionary state (RGB or RGB/AGB versus RC).
As described in the text, we use two generalized gamma distributions to model each distribution of stars with a
given dof (either 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). When summed, the two ﬁtted generalized gamma distributions are solutions to
a least-squares minimization problem to describe the data, with Poisson uncertainties assumed for each bin in the
observed distribution. To arrive at the ﬁt, each component is weighted using a free parameter to describe the relative
contribution of each component, and the degrees of freedom for each component are required to be less than or equal to
the nominal degrees of freedom for the observed distribution (i.e., the number of reporting pipelines, dof ). The solution
is found using the Trust Region Reﬂective method as implemented in the scipy function, curve ﬁt. As a reference, we

to-one relations. In the bottom panel, blue error bars indicate weighted averages and standard errors on the weighted averages

also ﬁt each of the six distributions for both RGB or RGB/AGB and RC stars using a generalized gamma distribution
with the uncertainty taken to be the median observed fractional uncertainty, and with the dof ﬁxed to be the number
of reporting pipelines. We do the same for the fractional uncertainty distributions for (cid:104)κ(cid:48)

R(cid:105) and (cid:104)κ(cid:48)

M (cid:105).

For (cid:104)ν(cid:48)

max(cid:105) among RGB or RGB/AGB stars, the fractional uncertainties inferred from ﬁtting the two-component
generalized gamma distribution model vary according to the number of pipelines that contribute to the scatter estimate,
from 1.1 − 2.1%. For RC stars, the ﬁtted uncertainties are larger, and have a range of 2.2 − 3.9%. The ﬁtted fractional
uncertainties on (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) have marginally smaller fractional uncertainties, and can range from 1.4% to 1.9% for RGB or
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105), therefore, the uncertainties vary
RGB/AGB stars and from 1.9% to 2.8% for RC stars. For both (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
more as a function of evolutionary state than number of pipelines reporting.

The uncertainty distributions for all of the RGB and RC stars are shown in Figures 20-21. We show both the expected
distribution according to the observed median uncertainties using a ﬁxed dof (grey curve), as well as the expected
distribution from the two-component model (black curve), where we sum the uncertainties from each dof , weighting
by the number of stars with a given dof . The agreement between the model for the uncertainties and the observed
uncertainty distributions indicates that the uncertainties are largely not a function of νmax or ∆ν. Nevertheless, the
approximation is not completely accurate:
lower values of νmax and ∆ν tend to have marginally larger fractional
uncertainties — up to 1% larger across the entire observed parameter range for νmax and ∆ν among RGB stars, and
up to 3% larger for νmax among dof = 2 and dof = 3 RC stars with νmax < 30µHz. (These latter low-νmax RC
stars contribute to the extra bump at σ(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) ≈ 3 in Figure 20.) The uncertainties are not strong functions of
magnitude, which reﬂects the fact that the uncertainties are not dominated by white noise, but rather the length of
the light curve, intrinsic properties of the star (e.g., evolutionary state), and pipeline agreement.

max(cid:105)/(cid:104)ν(cid:48)

(cid:104)κ(cid:48)

M (cid:105) fractional uncertainties reinforce the trend for fractional uncertainties to vary more as a function of evolutionary
state than a function of number of pipelines reporting: for RGB and RGB/AGB, the range is 6.2 − 9.0% and for RC
stars, the range is 9.9 − 12.1%. The uncertainty distributions of (cid:104)κ(cid:48)
M (cid:105) for all of the RGB and RC stars
are shown in Figures 22-23, where the grey and black curves correspond to the expected distribution according to
