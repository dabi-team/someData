Abstract—The increasing penetration of variable renewable en-
ergy (VRE) has brought signiﬁcant challenges for power systems
planning and operation. These highly variable sources are typi-
cally distributed in the grid; therefore, a detailed representation
of transmission bottlenecks is fundamental to approximate the
impact of the transmission network on the dispatch with VRE
resources. The ﬁne grain temporal scale of short term and day-
ahead dispatch, taking into account the network constraints, also
mandatory for mid-term planning studies, combined with the
high variability of the VRE has brought the need to represent
these uncertainties in stochastic optimization models while taking
into account the transmission system. These requirements impose
a computational burden to solve the planning and operation mod-
els. We propose a methodology based on community detection
to aggregate the network representation, capable of preserving
the locational marginal price (LMP) differences in multiple
VRE scenarios, and describe a real-world operational planning
study. The optimal expected cost solution considering aggregated
networks is compared with the full network representation. Both
representations were embedded in an operation model relying on
Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) to deal with the
random variables in a multi-stage problem.

I. INTRODUCTION

The very fast insertion of variable renewable energy (VRE)
sources such as wind and PV solar worldwide has brought
signiﬁcant economic and environmental beneﬁts. However, the
integration of large amounts of VRE capacity into the existing
power systems has created new planning and operational
challenges. For example, it is well known that 30 GW of wind
power in Germany are backed up by almost the same capacity
of thermal plants; the reason is that several days of zero wind
have occurred.

The VRE integration challenges exist even in countries like
Brazil, whose hydro plants (70% of todays 160 GW) with
multi-year storage can serve as water batteries to manage VRE
variability. The reason is that, in the next twenty years, the
countrys power mix is likely to change signiﬁcantly, with wind
and solar PV dominating generation expansion and reaching
60 GW and 55 GW, respectively (25 GW utility scale and 30
GW DG). This massive VRE share led to concerns about the
disruption of regional power ﬂow patterns and the increase of
production uncertainty well beyond that of hydro generation.
These concerns motivated the development of new planning
tools for the integrated planning (co-optimization) of genera-
tion, interconnection capacities and the generation reserve to
handle the variability of existing and planned VRE sources.
Fig. 1 shows the main components of this new tool.

Fig. 1. Co-optimization of generation, reserve and area interconnections.

We observe in the Fig. 1 that the optimal plan is obtained
through the iterative solution of four modules: The investment
module determines a trial expansion plan (represented by the
vector X) and its associated investment cost, represented as
I(X) [1]. Next, the Dynamic Probabilistic Reserve (DPR)
module calculates the generation reserve R(X) required to
handle the existing and planned VRE variability [2]. The
expansion plan and associated reserve are then sent to the
operation module, which carries out a probabilistic simulation
of the system operation and calculates the expected operation
cost O(X). Finally, the reliability module calculates the ex-
pected load curtailments due to generation and interconnection
outages, combined with VRE variability.

Also, as seen in Fig. 1, the objective is to ﬁnd a plan that
minimizes the sum of investment and expected operation costs,
subject to a supply reliability target (for example, the expected
energy curtailment should not exceed 0.2% of total yearly
load). This optimality is assured by the Benders decompo-
sition algorithm, in which the operation and supply reliability
modules send linear constraints, known as Benders cuts, to the
investment module, which is then re-solved, producing a new
plan, and so on.

A key component of the above scheme and the focus
of this paper is the aggregation of the transmission system,
which in the case of Brazil has 10 thousand buses and 14
thousand circuits into a multi-area system. In addition to
the signiﬁcant computational beneﬁts, this multi-area repre-
sentation allows the planner to have a better understanding
of the tradeoff between the costs of area generation reserve
and of interconnections. The reason is that, in large countries
the spatial correlation of VRE production
such as Brazil,
in different areas is usually small. Therefore, by investing
in interconnections, we obtain a portfolio effect and require
less reserve. Because of these conceptual and computational

 
 
 
 
 
 
beneﬁts, research interest in transmission network aggregation
methods has increased in the past years. In 2005, Cheng et
al. [3] proposed a reduction method that approximates the
power transfer distribution factors (PTDF) and the injection
shift factors (ISF) of the original system. However, they are not
capable of capturing the variability of congestion in scenarios.
In 2013, Cotilla-Sanchez et al. proposed a hybrid evolutionary
algorithm, which uses the k-means [4] as local improvement
and a multiattribute objective function to partition the network,
which takes account the electrical distances, the cluster sizes,
the number of clusters, the intra-cluster cohesiveness, and
intercluster connectedness. In 2016, Stocker et al. [5] modiﬁed
the [6], by adding the LMP to the ﬁtness function. In 2018,
et al. [7] proposed a spectral clustering, also combined with
the LMP. They analyzed a real-world application for network
aggregation of Germany, comparing the total system costs
obtained using the aggregated network with the reference
expansion planning solution. In 2018, the European Network
of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-
E) released a review [8] that proposed an algorithm that
computes the differences of the LMPs of each circuit and
starts grouping the buses with the smallest difference. This
procedure is similar to ﬁnd clusters using a minimum spanning
tree, like Prims algorithm [9].

This paper presents a new aggregation methodology that
uses the difference in nodal LMPs to identify transmission
constraints; represents the variability of those LMPs; and
complies with the requirement that the areas should be con-
nected. The proposed approach is based on a community
detection technique known as the GirvanNewman Algorithm
[10]. A capacitated graph represents the aggregated network.
The number of nodes is chosen so as the mimic the major
network bottlenecks using the locational marginal price (LMP)
differences of buses as metric along the study horizon; gener-
ators and loads are mapped to their corresponding nodes.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section
II presents the community detection methodology. Section
III describes the case study, an operation planning study
of Brazil, with the transmission bottlenecks observed,
the
network aggregation, and compare the total expected costs
obtained with a simulation using the aggregated network.
Section IV draws conclusions and prospects for future work.

II. METHODOLOGY

Now we detail the community detection algorithm applied
to power systems network aggregation. The algorithm can be
better explained by abstracting some of power system’s details
and thinking of its network as a graph in which vertices are
buses and edges are circuits, all the other parameters will be
ignored. In the following paragraphs we will associate weights
to the edges of the graph, however, these will not have straight
relation to the physical parameters of the network.

A. Community Detection

A fundamental concept for community detection algorithms
is the betweenness centrality. Betweenness centrality is a

measure based on shortest paths - or minimum weight paths -
introduced by Anthonisse in 1971 [11] and, later, generalized
by Freeman in 1977 [12]. Given a graph G = (V, E), where
V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges, let σst be
the number of shortest paths between the vertices s ∈ V and
t ∈ V . Let σst(v) be the number of shortest paths between s
and t that includes the vertex v ∈ V . Equation (1) deﬁnes the
betweenness centrality of the vertex v.

g(v) =

(cid:88)

s(cid:54)=v(cid:54)=t

σst(v)
σst

(1)

The concept of betweenness centrality was also extended
to edges, the edge betweenness centrality [13] is similarly
deﬁned by the number of shortest paths going through an
edge. In a weighted graph, where each edge has a numerical
value associated, weights are interpreted as distances: and this
is one of the main reasons for choosing Girvan-Newman.
Edges with smaller weights are more likely to belong to the
same community. The worst-case time complexity to compute
the edge betweenness of all vertices in a weighted graph is
O(EV + V 2 log V ) and consumes a O(V + E) space [14].

Now we can detail the selected algorithms for community
detection. The GirvanNewman Algorithm [10] belongs to a
hierarchical class of clustering methodologies [15] and de-
tects communities in graphs based on the edge betweenness
measure. The algorithm progressively computes the edge be-
tweenness centrality of the vertices and removes the highest
score edge. After several steps, the graph starts to break into
communities. When the iteration process is over, the algorithm
produces a dendrogram, where the root is the full graph, and
the leaves are the vertices. The worst-case time complexity of
the algorithm is O(E2V ). Algorithm 1 describes the general
structure of GirvanNewman:

2: while the graph is not empty do
3:
4:
5: end while

Remove the edge with highest score from the graph
Recompute the score of all remaining edges

B. Proximity Measure - Weights on Edges

The critical question now is how to deﬁne the edges’
weights. We seek to identify boundaries of interchanges be-
tween communities representing eventual electric grid bot-
tlenecks. We perform the identiﬁcation by preserving the
marginal cost of the network vertices within communities
homogeneous; this means that no critical network constraints
are active and, consequently, no signiﬁcant bottlenecks are
inside the community. Neighboring vertices with the same
average marginal cost correspond to regions where bottlenecks
do not occur due to internal transmission network constraints.
We deﬁne the distance between neighboring (connected)
vertices as the absolute value of the difference between their
respective nodal marginal costs. Given a sample of n marginal

cost of two neighboring vertices v1 and v2, deﬁned as πv1 and
πv2 respectively, Equation (2) describes the distance between
them.

It is possible to assess LMPs by computing the optimal
stochastic operating policy of a system considering the power
grid. It is possible to portray the locational signals resulting
from congestion in transmission bottlenecks, reﬂected in dif-
ferences in nodal marginal costs.

C. Complete Algorithm

Algorithm 2 summarizes the three steps of the community
detection for power systems: compute the optimal stochastic
operating policy of a system, representing electricity grid,
evaluate the distance for each vertex, and compute the Gir-
vanNewman Algorithm given the distances and topology of
the network.

III. CASE STUDY

Throughout this section, we analyze our algorithm applied
to a Brazilian power system. First of all, we compute the
optimal stochastic operating policy considering the electricity
grid, using the SDDP algorithm [16].

The neighboring vertices with the same average marginal
cost correspond to regions where bottlenecks do not occur due
to internal transmission network constraints, meaning that the
operating policy obtained by ignoring the transmission limits
internal to each region would be similar to the policy obtained
representing the full transmission network.

Once the algorithm returns the network aggregation, we
deﬁne the interconnection limits between each pair of com-
munities and represent the edges that interconnect them as
circuits with ﬂow limits equivalent
to the sum of limits
of the interconnecting circuits. In the aggregated model we
also ignore the Kirchoff voltage law. In order to process the
SDDP considering the proposed aggregation, we aggregate all
generators and demands of each community in a single vertex
representing the community.

A. Brazilian Power System

We evaluate our algorithm with a 2041 Brazilian case to
assess the quality of aggregate network modeling. Brazils
network has 9645 vertices and 14681 edges in the high voltage
network. Moreover we consider 152 thermal plants, 1806
renewable energy plants (solar, wind, biomass, small hydros)

and 179 hydro plants, 79 of which have large reservoirs.
As typical from the SDDP framework, the state-space has
79 + 179L states, where L is the number of lags on the inﬂow
stochastic process, L = 6 in this case. The number of scenarios
considered in this study is 200 and the number of stages is
12. We consider a given future cost function in the end of the
12th stage. This is a ﬁctitious approximation of the Brazilian
power system in the year 2041.

B. Aggregated System

Given a pre-processed case of the Brazilian power system,
we can use the spot prices and apply the community detection
algorithm, setting the number of communities to 7. Because
the underlying graph is large, the community detection step
is moderately large, taking 31 minutes. The obtained com-
munities and their main characteristics are presented in the
sequence.

Fig. 2 shows the network buses above 138 kV as vertices,
high voltage circuits as edges, and the seven communities
obtained with our algorithm.

Table I shows the following characteristics for each com-

munity:

2) The number of vertices;
3) How many edges are internal to the community;
4) How many edges connect it to neighboring communities;
5) The average marginal cost of the vertices ($/MWh);
6) The average distance of the edges connecting their

vertices (internal edges);

7) The average distance of the edges connecting the com-
munity to another neighboring community (boundary
edges).

in terms of generation scheduling and spot prices.

power systems, testing other variations of weights for the
edges in the community detection algorithm and developing

IV. CONCLUSION

We proposed a methodology to simplify network represen-
tations based on community detection and pre-computed spot-
prices. The method was the applied to a detailed representation
of the Brazilian power system.

The community detection algorithm was executed in rea-
sonable time and produced a bus clustering that can be used
in a power system simulation.

The simpliﬁed network was contrasted with the detailed one
on a simulation of the power system operation for a large
number of scenarios. The objective function of the underlying
optimization problems, the system operative cost, was very
well approximated varying less than one percent.

The simulation time of the aggregated problem was, as
expected, much smaller than the complete system simulation.
This indicates that the methodology can be used in simpliﬁed
simulations where the execution time of a complete system is
prohibitive.

The average behavior of spot prices and generation from
different technologies show that the network simpliﬁcation can
be used to approximate many simulation outputs other than
total cost.
