Abstract—New  technologies  are  adapted  to  made  progress  in 
healthcare  especially  for  independent  livings.  Medication  at 
distance  is  leading  to  integrate  technologies  with  medical. 
Machine learning methods in collaboration with wearable sensor 
network  technology  are  used  to  find  hidden  patterns  in  data, 
detect  patient  movements,  observe  habits  of  patient,  analyze 
clinical  data  of  patient,  find  intention  of  patients  and  make 
decision  on  the  bases  of  gathered  data.  This  research  performs 
comparative  study  on  non-clinical  systems  in  healthcare  for 
independent livings. In this study, these systems are sub-divided 
w.r.t  their  working  into  two  types:  single  purpose  systems  and 
multi-purpose systems. Systems that  are  built for  single specific 
purpose (e.g. detect fall, detect emergent state of chronic disease 
patient) and cannot support healthcare generically are known as 
single purpose systems, where multi-purpose systems are built to 
serve for multiple problems (e.g. heart attack, fall detection etc.) 
by  using  single  system.  This  study  analyzes  usages  of  machine 
learning techniques in healthcare systems for independent livings. 
Answer  Set  Programming  (ASP),  Artificial  Neural  Networks, 
Classification, Sampling and Rule Based Reasoning etc. are some 
state of art techniques used to determine emergent situations and 
observe changes in patient data. Among all methods, ASP logic is 
used most widely, it is due to its feature to deal with incomplete 
data.  It  is  also  observed  that  system  using  ANN  shows  better 
accuracy  than  other  systems.  It  is  observed  that  most  of  the 
systems  created  are  for  single  purpose.  In  this  work,  10  single 
purpose systems and 5 multi-purpose systems are studied. There 
is need to create more generic systems that can be used for patients 
with  multiple  diseases.  Also  most  of  the  systems  created  are 
prototypical.  There  is  need  to  create  systems  that  can  serve 
healthcare  services  in  real  world.  Some  systems  are  hard  to  be 
used in real life due to large hardware requirements. Although, 
good  systems  are  created  but  still  there  is  need  to  build  more 
efficient, affordable, adoptive and generic systems.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

healthcare  research.  It  is  hard  to  analyze  data  and  draw 
important  conclusions  from  it.  Different  machine  learning 
techniques [2] are being used to analyze complex patient’s data 
to extract useful information. These techniques analyze patient 
state  and  detect  emergent  situations  [8-10]  and  response 
accordingly. The main aim of using intelligent systems is not 
only  to  detect  problem  but  also  provide  solution  to  that 
problem. This review will analyze selected systems proposed 
in past few years for independent livings. These systems detect 
emergent situations [8], do risk analysis, provide personal care 
[11],  work  as  a  coach  and  inform  how  to  response  under 
particular  scenario.  This  research  analyzes  advantages  and 
limitations of these systems. This research analyzes state of art 
techniques used in these systems. 

II.  SYSTEMS AND TECHNIQUES  

Several systems are proposed in last few years for continuous 
healthcare by using machine learning technique. This research 
study  systems  that  have  following  features:  a  device  for 
collecting  data;  an  “intelligent”  part  to  process  on  patient’s 
data;  Ability  to  detect  certain  situations;  response  after 
detection  and  system  type  can  be  prototypical,  implemented, 
proposed  model  etc.    To  increase  level  of  understanding  we 
categorized  these  systems  into  two  major  categories:  Single 
Purpose and Multi-Purpose systems.  

A.  Single Purpose Systems: Systems that are built for specific 
disease are called single purpose. Special systems are made for 
fall  detection  [12-14].  In  these  systems,  ambient  intelligence 

A 

 bout  20%  of  world  population  will  have  age  60  or 
above. Population of older is  increasing than children 
[1].  Aging  is  bringing  health  related  problems  e.g. 
increase in diseases, increase in healthcare cost and shortage of 
care  givers  etc.  To  overcome  these  problems  non-clinical 
healthcare systems get attention. Non clinical systems are built 
for  independent  livings.  Fast  advances  in  sensors  and 
networking technologies and their integration with intelligent 
systems make it possible to get personal healthcare services at 
distant  [1].  Remarkable  advantages  are  taken  from  machine 
require 
learning  methods 
continuous and fast data collection and processing to get useful 
information [2]. In healthcare, data may contains patient profile 
(history), values of vital signs and medical data. For this sake, 
machine  learning  techniques  are  playing  most  vital  role  in 

[3-7].  Non-clinical  systems 

Fig. 1. Generic System Architecture   

with  single  and  multiple  agents  are    used.  Architecture  of  a 
generic system is given in Fig 1. 

i.  Ambient  intelligence  is  an  electronic  environment 
built  up  of  smaller  devices  connected  with  each  other  and  is 
responsive to people. Single ambient agent is used as a personal 
coach  to  guide  patient  about  its  exercise  actions  [15].  This 
personal  coach  observes  movements  of  a  person  and  takes 
record of its normal movements and time for that movement.

Coach learning and set of normal movement vary from person 
to person. Coach then compare present movement of a person 
with real movement to identify gaps. This learning coach can 
be  used  for  exercise  and  recovery  after  some  incident 
[15].Minor  changing  in  physical  movement  of  a  person  will 
also be detected as false movement. On the other hand, physical 
movements vary from person to person. 

 And multi-agents are used for online interaction of patient and 
doctor.  It  also  takes  doctors  feedback  on  emergent  situations  
Six  major  agents  are  used  to  build  system  [16].  Every  agent 
performs its specific job and is connected to agent next to it.  
First agent gathers data, second agent check and pass it, third 
agent  filters  received  data  and  send  it  to  agent  connected  to 
doctor. Then doctor response back to situation. Data is stored 
in online databases. Major decision making task is performed 
by sixth agent. For analyzing data association rule mining  [17] 
is used. Historical data of patient is also used. It make to classes 
of data “normal” and “emergency”. And check every situation 
under  these  two  classes  [16].  It  also  updates  patient  record. 
System  is  inexpensive  and  flexible  in  communication.  But 
large memory and energy is requirement of system.  

I.T- based services  

ii. 
A system that provides tailoring facility is named U-care 
[11]. Care-givers IT-based tailoring means that care-giver can 
set their service plans (e.g. alarms for medicine, service alerts, 
and calendars etc.) and also can make decision on the basis of 
professional  knowledge  on  distance.  Alerts  are  sent  to  care-
receiver on its mobile phone [11]. System is inexpensive and it 
improves  quality  of  life.  But  as  it  is  created  for  elderly,  it  is 
difficult  for  elderly  to  use  and  understand  system  functions. 
Usually, elderly people do not like to use such systems. 

iii. 

Emergency Detection in Chronic Disease Patients  
Several  systems  are  built  to  detect  emergent  situations  for 
independent  livings.  These  systems  continuously  monitor 
independents. Systems are specially built to detect emergency 
for chronic disease patient. Some Emergency detection systems 

2 

are: (ontology based, real time health care, CRNT+, HUMECS 
and fall detection). 

Formal  representation  of  knowledge  in  form  of 
hierarchy of concepts within an area using common properties, 
types and interrelation of concepts is called ontology [18].   An 
ontology-based context-aware model for patients with chronic 
conditions  is  proposed  in  [18].  This  system  is  proposed  to 
provide  long  term  health  services.  System  collects  data  that 
contains  patient’s  biomedical  data,  location,  environmental 
data and social data. Social data is taken because patients with 
chronic conditions have greater effect of society. Reasoning is 
performed  over  knowledge  (gain  from  ontology  based 
formulism) and knowledgebase using rule-based and ontology-
based engines to detect risk related to patient’s conditions [18]. 
Accuracy of a system can be considered 64%.  But wrong data 
entry can make solution worse. Huge data is required for [18].  
A real time healthcare using classification and association 
rule mining [17] model is proposed for chronic disease patients 
[10].  System  takes  clinical,  historical  and  continuous  data  of 
patient. To predict patient condition, “data filtering and feature 
extraction  is  performed  to  remove  unwanted  data  factors. 
Major flaw of rule mining is that increasing data will increase 
rules that will cause increase in processing time. 

A  toolbox  named  CRNT+  is  developed  by  [9]  for  smart 
phones.  This  system  analyze  whether  patient  is  in  need  of 
external help or not. Sensors are fixed inside phone to collect 
patient’s data, after collecting data, sampling and classification 
[17]]  is  performed  over  that  data.  If  external  help  is  needed 
system send alarms of help to caregivers. Process is performed 
in real time. Data about patient is stored online and fetch further 
when  needed.  This  system  is  extended  form  of  CRNT  [19]. 
CRNT+ takes low energy and it is extendable. Major drawback 
of CRNT + is that works only in day times. 

Hoseo University mobile e-healthcare system (HUMECS) 
using  Neural  Network  is  proposed  to  deal  with  patients  that 
needs first aid. HUMECS provides mobile based E-healthcare 
that detects location of patient in emergency and send message 
to guardian and hospital to provide emergency measures.  For 
analyzing patient’s data Personal mobile host (PMH) is used. 
PMH  has  different  sensor  modules  (acceleration  sensor, 
vibration  sensor,  GPS).  Data  related  to  normal  walking, 
fainting and seizures etc. is collected from sensors and inputted 
in  back  propagation  network.  Network  diagnoses  whether 
patient is in emergency or not? If emergency is detected than 
message  is  sent  to  control  center  that  includes  patient’s 
information and location. [8]. But as data will be gathered from 
far points, it may holds noise which can cause wrong detection. 

Fall detection  

iv. 
Fall  detection  systems  are  very  important  especially  in 
elderly care. It is observed from a survey that death rate due to 
“falls” is increasing. Three third of people have age above 65 
died due to “falls” [20]. There are three main categories of fall 
detection  systems.  Following  are  categories:  [14]  ambient 
based, vision based and wearable based. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Systems  that  depend  on  pressure  sensors  are  called 
ambient based systems. A non-wearable ambient based system 
to  detect  fall  is  proposed  in  [12].  This  system  use  Doppler-
Based  sensors  to  collect  features.  Two  classification  [17] 
methods  (Support  vector  machine,  K-nearest  neighbor)  are 
used  to  classify  extracted  features.  System  gives  alarms  to 
detect fall [12].  System is checked in close room. Where there 
was no interference. Structure of system shows that it may not 
work well in open area. As outer interference will be there. 

Systems that are related to shapes and postures of body 
are  called  vision  based  systems.  A  vision  based  system  that 
collects full human posture in 3D form is proposed in [13] to 
detect  fall.  Preprocessing  is  performed  over  data  by  using 
Principal  component  Analysis  (PCA).  A  database  is  used  to 
store all possible moves of fall from several different people. 
And  compare  user  moves  with  stored  moves.  System  is 
inexpensive and result of system is 92%-100% [013]. But with 
increasing data system performance will be decrease.  

Methods that used wearable sensors to detect fall are called 
wearable based methods [14]. A wearable sensors based system 
that  uses  Signal  Measurement  Vector  (SMV)  to  detect  falls 
effectively is proposed in [14]. This system gives accuracy of 
96%. It uses batteries that consume low power. But at the same 
time it is expensive to implement such embedded systems.  It 
is difficult for a patient to handle wires and wear sensors all the 
time. Position of sensor will affect output of system.  

B.  Multi-purpose  systems:  Systems  that  are  built  to  serve 
multiple problems (heart attack, fall detection etc.) fall under 
multi-purpose systems.  These systems can support in several 
situations (heart attack, fall detection etc.).  

a.  Emergency Detection through Context Awareness 

Context  Awareness  is  property  of  a  system  to  understand 
current location and condition of user and response according 
to  the  contextualized  condition  [21].  In  healthcare,  context 
awareness in used to identify the condition of patient and his 
interaction  with  application.  Different  applications  of 
healthcare with context aware ability are: Cyber care, SINDI, 
home healthcare, context care,  

A  system  named  Cyber  Care  [22]  collected  patient 
through  wearable  acquisition  devices  and 
clinical  data 
movements of patient through sensors in proposed in [22]. ASP 
logic program is implemented to detect emergency from data. 
This system deals with continuous real time data. Both static 
and dynamic data is collected. Static data holds clinical data. 
Dynamic  data  holds  patients  biomedical  parameters,  list  of 
moves, patients. Data is converted into logic predicates. This 
program converts solution into actions [22].   

A logical approach for home health care is proposed 
in [23]. Reasoning component based on ASP logic program is 
used for detecting patient situation. ASP logic performs three 
major  reasoning  tasks:  contextualizing  patient’s  physical, 
mental and social state continuously, predicting possible risky 
situation  and  finding  reasons  for  risky  situations.  On  every 
inference,  indicators  are  compared  with  previous  inference. 
Different evaluations are performed. This system results 88% 
accuracy. But settlement of sensors can effects data input also 
moves of hands and arms cannot be detected [23]. 

3 

A  contextual  model  that  based  on  ASP  logic  is 
introduced in [24] for situation judgment. This model is highly 
declarative for feed-back policy. Logic base of this system is 
used to: Understand risky situations in context awareness way 
and give feed-back according to situation. 

Contexta-care  [25]  system  that  collects  continuous 
physical data of patient and predict risky situations using rule 
based  is proposed in  [25]. Three type of rules are  generated: 
Rule of physical movements, Rules for environment and Rules 
for  both  feature  [25].  But  large  memory  is  required  for  this 
system.  Increase  in  data  will  decrease  efficiency  of  system. 
System may require more time for rules making.   

A  system  with  intelligent  reasoning  component  is 
proposed  in  [26].  Intelligent  logical  reasoning]  component 
collects  continuous  contextual,  mental  and  social  state  of 
person,  analyze  that  data  and  predict  risky  situation.  It  also 
identifies reason of emergency [26]. Master processor is used 
for fast processing and to fulfill memory requirements.  But it 
makes system costly and difficult to implement.  

III.  TECHNIQUES 

Intelligence.  Machine 

From  above  section  it  is  analyzed  that  several  machine 
learning  techniques  [2]  are  used  in  healthcare  to  provide 
services  to  individual.  This  section  will  give  introduction  of 
most  randomly  used  techniques.  Machine  learning  is  sub-
discipline  of  Artificial 
learning 
techniques  have  ability  to  learn  from  heuristic  data  (training 
data) and predict accordingly [27]. Following machine learning 
techniques are used in above discussed systems. 
i.  Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Model of neural networks 
hold set of interlinked nodes. A unit that take some input and 
produce  useful  output  is  called  node.  Values  of  nodes  are 
determined by their links.  Back propagation Neural Network is 
basic type of ANN [27]. Values are propagated back till it meets 
specific  threshold  [8].  In  healthcare  back  propagation  neural 
network is used in [8].  
ii.Support vector Machine: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is 
supervised machine learning technique. SVM is used to identify 
patterns in data and then classify it accordingly.  
iii. 
Signal  measurement  vector:  measurement  vector 
(SMV)  is  a  machine  learning  technique  used  in  signal 
processing.  
iv. 
Classification: In  classification,  every  object belongs 
to  a  specific  class. This  process of assigning  classes is  called 
classifying object. Classification is used where decision making 
and  prediction  is  required  [17]].  In  healthcare  study  class 
classification is used in [9] [16] [12]. K-nearest neighbor is used 
for classification and regression in this input is “k” and output 
depends on input “k” [28]. Sampling selects data elements and 
creates subsets of data. Simple sampling may not perform well 
[17].  
v.Association Rule Mining: Association rules are generated from 
frequent data patterns [17] [27]. In association rule, confidence 
and support of data is calculated [17]. On the basis of calculated 
support  and  confidence  probability  of  occurrence  of  rules 
checked. Association rules are used in healthcare in [16] [10].  
vi. 
Rule based Reasoning: In rule based reasoning, rules 
are  made  accordingly  forward  reasoning  and  backward 
reasoning are two ways of reasoning. Systems used rule based 
in healthcare are [25] [18].

vii. 
Answer  set  Programming:  ASP  logic  is  used  most 
widely  in  healthcare  systems.  It  is  default  reasoning  method.  
Systems that use ASP logic are [22] [29] [23] [24] [26]. Table 1 
show use of machine learning methods in healthcare systems. 
Frequency of technique is also shown in Table 1.  From this one 
can observe, which technique is used most randomly. Table 2 
contains  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  above  mention 
techniques. It is observed ASP performs well in multi-purpose 
systems  and  give  accuracy  measure  “60%  to  88%”.  While 
neural networks and SMV are used for single purpose systems 
give accuracy measure “91% to 9 7.   

IV.  COMPARISON 

 Systems and Techniques discussed in section 3 and section 4. 
In this section, we compare discussed techniques and systems 
in  terms  of  their  accuracy,  efficiency,  system  type  and 
interfaces. We also analyze use of technologies and effect of 
data  processing  methods  used.  Table  3  shows  accuracy  of 
systems. It is to measure performance of all system. It can be 
observed from accuracy ratios that fall detection systems gives 
better accuracy rate that is between 90%-100% (100% in rare 
cases).  Others  give  accuracy  between  60%-  85%.    Table  3

and  Table  6  holds  type  of  model  and  its  storage  and  data 
requirements.  We  observed  every  system  model  type  in 
categories: implemented (I), prototypical (P), Under Test (UT) 
and Framework (F). It is observed that most of systems created 
are  prototypical  and  not  applied  in  real  world  to  provide 
healthcare  services.    Also  most of system requires  huge data

storage. Healthcare systems are built with large continuous data 
requirement.  By  setting  priority  of  data  run  time  can  be 
decreased.  Only  few system  set priority of data.  Table 5 and 
table 6 holds some features that are important for systems. Only 
four  out  of  fifteen  have  preprocessing  feature.  Only  two 
systems need human support which is good ratio. Eight out of 
fifteen gives feedback mean after predicting emergency it also 
deals  with  that  emergency.  By  sending  alarm,  precaution  or 
calling care-givers 

V.  CONCLUSION 

  This research studies systems built specially for independent 
livings.  And  provide  analysis  of  techniques  used  in  these 
systems. Data is collected through sensors or cameras. Wrong 
settlement  of  sensors  can  affect  input  data.  Wrong  entry  in 
online databases can also affect system output. There is need to 
proper pre-process data to remove noise element. ASP logic is 
used most widely for inference due to its feature to deal with 
incomplete data. Artificial Neural network (ANN) was used by 
one  single  purpose  system  and  has  shown  best  accuracy 
measure. ANN produce better results than ASP logic and other 
methods.  It  is  observed  that  most  of  the  system  created  are 
prototypical  and  not  applied  in  real  to  serve  health  care 
services.  Mostly  systems  are  created  for  a  single  purpose.  
Mostly systems are expensive.  Due to huge use of hardware 
some system are difficult to adopt.
