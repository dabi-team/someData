Abstract— We present

the second edition of OpenEDS
dataset, OpenEDS2020, a novel dataset of eye-image sequences
captured at a frame rate of 100 Hz under controlled illumi-
nation, using a virtual-reality head-mounted display mounted
with two synchronized eye-facing cameras. The dataset, which is
anonymized to remove any personally identiﬁable information
on participants, consists of 80 participants of varied appearance
performing several gaze-elicited tasks, and is divided in two
subsets: 1) Gaze Prediction Dataset, with up to 66,560 sequences
containing 550,400 eye-images and respective gaze vectors,
created to foster research in spatio-temporal gaze estimation
and prediction approaches; and 2) Eye Segmentation Dataset,
consisting of 200 sequences sampled at 5 Hz, with up to
29,500 images, of which 5% contain a semantic segmentation
label, devised to encourage the use of temporal information to
propagate labels to contiguous frames. Baseline experiments
have been evaluated on OpenEDS2020, one for each task,
with average angular error of 5.37 degrees when performing
gaze prediction on 1 to 5 frames into the future, and a mean
intersection over union score of 84.1% for semantic segmen-
tation. As its predecessor, OpenEDS dataset, we anticipate
that this new dataset will continue creating opportunities to
researchers in eye tracking, machine learning and computer
vision communities, to advance the state of the art for virtual
reality applications. The dataset is available for download
upon request at http://research.fb.com/programs/

I. INTRODUCTION

Eye tracking has emerged as a powerful tool for a number
of applications, including health assessment, disease diagno-
sis [3], [13] and human behavior [16] and communication [4]
analysis. Nonetheless, the ﬁelds that have recently boosted its
potential are virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).
Indeed, the potential applications of AR/VR technology to
a multitude of sectors such as online education [5], health-
care [9], [11], entertainment [8], [19], communication [21],
[10] and/or gaming industry [22], [12] have created an ever-
growing demand of more realistic and immersive AR/VR
experiences.

One of the core technologies that allows to have high qual-
ity immersion experience in VR/AR while keeping computa-
tional cost of generating the environment low is a technique
called Foveated Rending (FR) [18]. FR presents a high-
quality picture at the point where a user is looking, while
reducing the quality of the picture in the periphery according
to a function of human visual acuity. This non-uniform image

degradation substantially reduces graphical pipelines power
consumption without decreasing the perceptual quality of the
generated picture. However, fast eye movements present a
challenge for FR due to the transmission and processing
delays present in the eye tracking and graphical pipelines.
If the delays are not compensated for, fast eye movements
can take a persons gaze to the areas of the image that
are rendered with low quality,
thus degrading the users
experience. Among the ways of remedying this issue are: a
reduction of delays, which is not always possible; predicting
future gaze locations, thus compensating for the delays; or a
combination of both.

Considering real-time requirements of FR and its goal
of reducing power consumption, the prediction of future
gaze points based on a short subsequence of the already-
estimated gaze locations is considered the most fruitful path
of exploration. Accurate eye movement prediction requires
high quality underlying signal to be effective. One of the
important metrics describing the quality of the captured
raw eye positional signal is spatial accuracy which can be
linked to the accuracy of eye segmentation when machine
learning approaches are employed for gaze estimation. It
must be noted that spatial accuracy is critical not only for
eye movement prediction, but also for applications such as
health assessment, and direct gaze interaction.

The two predominant approaches for image/video-based
gaze estimation, also known as video occulography, can
be broadly classiﬁed into geometric and appearance-based
systems [7]. Geometric approaches treat
the human eye
as a sphere-on-sphere model [6] and ﬁnd the pupil and
glint locations in a precisely calibrated system of cameras
and LEDs to infer the 3D location of the pupil and the
gaze direction. More recent geometric approaches do not
require dedicated systems and/or glints, and make use of
3D morphable models instead [23], [25]. On the other hand,
appearance-based models are typically based on end-to-
end inference models, such as deep Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) [27], [17], to directly estimate the gaze
direction in the frame of reference of the camera. Nowadays,
both geometric and appearance-based approaches usually
rely on one or more deep learning modules to tackle the large
variations in eye appearances due to anatomical differences,
lighting, camera viewpoint and/or makeup across the human
population. While the current state-of-the-art appearance-
based methods exploit end-to-end deep networks to directly
regress gaze from input eye/face images, geometric methods
deploy highly accurate segmentation networks to extract
pupil, iris, sclera and skin regions for further processing [26].

In real-world applications, the input to any gaze estimation
system are temporal sequences of eye-images in the form of
a video. However, most popular approaches do not exploit
temporal information and instead estimate gaze direction
for each frame separately. Intuitively,
there exists useful
temporal information in videos that can be leveraged to im-
prove the current gaze estimation approaches. For example,
incorporating the velocity and direction of the eyeball motion
can be leveraged to improve upon gaze estimation [14] and
semantic segmentation accuracy. While a number of remote-
camera-based works have recently started to exploit this area
of research [15], [24], the lack of high-resolution, real-world
datasets with images sampled at a sufﬁcient sampling rate
to capture small and fast eye movements, such as saccades,
with accurate ground-truth annotations, is affecting further
progress on the topic.

In this paper, and motivated from the aforementioned
gap in the literature, we release OpenEDS2020, a large-
scale anonymized dataset of sequences of high-resolution
eye-images (640 × 400 pixels) sampled at 100 Hz with
semantic segmentation and gaze direction annotations. This
dataset provides higher resolution and higher frame rate
image sequences in comparison to existing publicly available
datasets, as well as accurate gaze direction and semantic
segmentation annotations. We believe OpenEDS2020 can be
instrumental to advance the current state of the art in gaze
estimation research and benchmarking of existing algorithms.

II. DATA COLLECTION

The dataset was captured from 90 voluntary participants of
ages between 20 and 70 with appearance variability in terms
of ethnicity, gender, and age, and some of them wearing
glasses, contact lenses, and/or make-up. These participants
provided written informed consent for using their eye images
for research and commercial purposes before taking part in
the data collection stage. Participants were asked to wear a
VR head-mounted display (VR-HMD), mounted with two
synchronized eye-facing infrared cameras at a frame rate of
100 Hz, and were recorded while gazing at speciﬁc dot-
patterns displayed on a blank screen with different target
movements. The dataset was anonymized to remove any
personally identiﬁable information on the participants for
further processing, as explained in Sections 3 and 4.

Each recording consisted of a set of patterns as follows:
ring-shaped patterns at ±20 degrees eliciting smooth pursuit
movements, and random point changes to induce saccades,
where the targets were moved in a ±20 degree cone from 50
cm in depth to 600 cm. Other variations included changing
the brightness of the background from light to dark to ensure
the effects of pupil dilation were captured, and moving the
headset while recording to simulate slippage. Each recording
session lasted approximately 5 minutes. Example images of
the collected dataset are shown in Figure 1.

III. GAZE PREDICTION

This subset of data is aimed at fostering research on spatio-
temporal methods for gaze estimation and prediction for

tasks involving different eye movements, such as saccades,
ﬁxations and smooth pursuit. Examples of different eye
movements are illustrated in Fig. 2. Based on the eye
movement characteristics [20] and the frame rate of our
dataset, we propose to predict 1 to 5 frames (10 to 50 ms) into
the future, which is a useful range in AR/VR applications [1].
Furthermore, we hypothesize that 50 frames (500 ms) is a
reasonable number to set as the maximum amount of frames
that can be used to initialize a gaze prediction model, and
design the dataset based on these decisions.

A. Dataset curation

Two types of patterns were selected for this data subset,
due to the differences in eye movement dynamics associated
to them:

• Smooth pursuit-elicited pattern, intertwining 1s ﬁxa-
tions at ﬁxed depths with 1s-long smooth pursuit move-
ments as smooth transitions between ﬁxation points,
with a total of 17 ﬁxations and 16 transitions per
recording.

• Saccade-elicited pattern, with 1s-long randomly-located
target ﬁxations at different depths and instantaneous
(0.1s) target transitions, with up to 20 ﬁxations per
recording.

All subjects were recorded following both pattern types
and the collected data was anonymized. Frames with invalid
ground truth gaze vector, due to either subject distractions,
blinks or incorrect estimates (see Section III-B), were manu-
ally discarded, maintaining 80 out of the initial 90 subjects.
The remaining data was further processed by randomly se-
lecting s non-overlapping sequences of f contiguous frames
each per pattern, with a maximum of 100 frames (1s) per se-
quence. This way, each sequence can contain either ﬁxations
only, smooth pursuit movement only, combination of ﬁxation
and smooth pursuit, and combination of ﬁxation and saccadic
movement. Each eye was processed individually, and right
eyes (from the camera point of view) and respective ground
truth vectors were ﬂipped horizontally to seamlessly augment
the data.

We believe that an eye tracking dataset designed for
potential spatio-temporal methods should contain a sufﬁ-
ciently representative gaze angle distribution and appearance
variability to train a gaze estimation model, while ensur-
ing variability in terms of eye movements, directions and
velocities to train a gaze prediction model. We therefore
devise three different subject-independent partitions of our
dataset, with 32 subjects for training, 8 for validation and
40 for test. To do so, we performed stratiﬁed sampling in
terms of gender, ethnicity, age and glasses, to ensure having
a representative sample for testing.

The training subset consists of 10 100-frame sequences
per eye, type of pattern and anonymized subject, with a total
of 4,000 images per subject and 128,000 images in total.
Assuming that we can use up to 50 frames to initialize a
gaze prediction model to predict up to 5 frames into the
future, using a sliding window of stride 1 allows us to
obtain up to 46 subsequences in a 100-frame sequence, which

sums up to 58,880 ﬁnal sequences in the training set (i.e.
1,280 100-frame sequences in which a sliding window of
stride 1 and size 55 is used to create subsequences). For
validation and test subsets, however, we chose to use 55-
frame sequences so as to have one set of initialization frames
and predictions per sequence, which facilitates evaluation
and analysis. To compensate for the difference in number
of effective sequences with respect to the training set, we
selected approximately 80 55-frame sequences per type of
pattern and subject, with 70,400 images for validation and
352,000 for test. For subjects for which there was not
enough valid data to obtain such 80 sequences per pattern,
the maximum amount of valid sequences was selected, and
the remaining sequences were obtained from other subjects
until we obtained the desired number of sequences, 1,280
and 6,400, respectively. Note that the goal of training and
validation subsets is both gaze estimation and prediction,
while the goal of the test subset is gaze prediction. Therefore,
even though the number of images is substantially bigger for
the test set, the number of sequences is what we focus on.
The distribution of ground truth gaze angles (horizontal and
vertical component of gaze) for each data split is depicted
in Fig. 3, and their general statistics in terms of subjects
variability and number of images and sequences per split
shown in Table I.

B. Annotations

Ground truth 3D gaze vectors are provided per each eye
image. Gaze vectors and cornea centers of each eye were
obtained using a hybrid model, which combines a deep eye
segmentation model (see Section V-B) with a classical user-
calibrated glint-based model [6]. Since these models are

frame-based and thus may produce ﬂuctuating estimates,
a median ﬁlter of window size 5 was used to temporally
smooth resulting gaze vectors. An offset correction was
further applied to them per subject and pattern, by subtracting
the average difference between cornea-to-target vectors and
gaze vectors.

IV. SEMANTIC EYE SEGMENTATION
This subset of data is aimed at exploiting the temporal
information available in the form of short temporal sequences
of eye images to improve the semantic segmentation accu-
racy achieved by treating each frame separately. While there
could be multiple approaches to exploit temporal information
for improving semantic segmentation, we resort to a simple
and practically useful problem of accurate label propagation
from a few labeled images to all the frames in a sequence.
On one hand, this problem can serve as a test-bed and fu-
ture improvements for the latest deep-learning based spatio-
temporal models for real-time inference in videos, few-
shot learning, geometry-constrained semantic segmentation
and/or co-segmentation. On the other hand, this problem also
helps in generating high-quality pseudo ground truth data
generation for training semantic segmentation networks.

A. Dataset curation

We start the curation process with the initial data, that
is, a total of ∼600K images in the form of 594 temporal
sequences and 11,476 hand-annotated semantic segmentation
masks chosen randomly for annotation. Let us deﬁne the

total are the number of labeled samples
and the total number of samples in the ith sequence Si,
respectively. For this dataset, we decided to set R ≈ 5%,
or in other words, provide ∼5% labeled samples for each
sequence. This choice is motivated from the practical consid-
erations of the size of the available dataset and annotations.
In order to maintain R ≈ 5% for training, we subsampled the
data at 5Hz and chose top 200 sequences sorted in decreasing
order of R, which resulted in ∼150 frames (∼30 seconds of
recording) for a total of 29,476 frames with 2,605 semantic-
segmentation annotation masks. Fig. 5 shows the ratio of
labels vs. total number of samples for all the 594 sequences.
Out of the total 2,605 annotations, we randomly hide 5
samples per sequence as the test samples, that eventually
leads to R ≈ 5% for training and 3% for testing. The
200 sequences were obtained from 74 different subjects.
Additional statistics for this dataset can be found in Table II.
Note that the statistics are presented at a complete sequence
level and not at frame level.

Human annotations are provided in the form of pixel-level

OF ANGULAR ERROR BETWEEN PREDICTED AND GROUND TRUTH 3D
GAZE VECTORS, IN DEGREES.

Our gaze prediction approach relies on linear regression.
In particular, we use a window of 50 estimated gaze angles
to compute the regression parameters using 2 independent
regression models, that is, one per gaze axis in 2D. The
estimated parameters are used to predict the next 5 frames
into the future. We apply our trained gaze estimation network
on the test subset to estimate gaze for the ﬁrst 50 frames
of each sequence, compute linear regression parameters on
them and predict the next 5 frames. Table III summarizes
the obtained results. We can see that the error increases
with time, which is expected. Furthermore, we can also
observe that such a simple approach works fairly well for
ﬁxation and smooth pursuit sequences, which account for
most of the dataset samples. However, the obtained error
for saccades is large, as observed from p95 values. This is
also expected mainly for two reasons. First, saccades usually
follow a ballistic trajectory, thus not properly modeled with a
linear model. Second, saccades have a duration of about 20 to
200ms; therefore, linear regression cannot predict extremely
short saccades that happen after the initialization window.

B. Semantic eye segmentation

In order

to set a baseline for spatio-temporal eye-
segmentation algorithms, we chose to train a deep-CNN on
1,605 images whose corresponding hand-annotated semantic
segmentation masks are provided. The network follows an
encoder-decoder architecture loosely based on SegNet [2].
Modiﬁcations include a power efﬁcient version that contains
7 downscaler blocks for the encoder and 7 upscaler blocks for
the decoder, with each block containing separable convolu-
tion that factorizes depth-wise convolution and a 1x1 convo-
lution to optimize for computation cost. We use LeakyReLU
activation and multiplicative skip connections with guide
layers that reduce down the layers to a single channel to pass
to the decoder, which again reduces computational cost.

We trained the network for 150 epochs with ADAM
optimizer, with initial learning rate of 0.004 and batch size
of 128. We utilized random rotation and intensity scaling for
augmentations. Model training and inference was performed
on downsampled images of size 128×128 pixels. The total
number of parameters of the model was 40k and the resulting
model size was only 300KB.

The trained network is tested on the hidden set of test sam-
ples without exploiting any temporal information, achieving
a mIoU score of 0.841, see Table. V-B for complete results.

annotations are provided in Fig. 4.

V. BASELINE METHODOLOGIES

In this section, we describe and evaluate a set of baseline
models for each data subset to demonstrate the usefulness
and validity of the data for the suggested tasks.

A. Gaze prediction

We propose a simple baseline model for the Gaze Pre-
diction dataset, in which spatio-temporal information is not
jointly leveraged. Instead, we disentangle gaze estimation
from prediction, estimating ﬁrst the line of gaze from each
eye image individually, and then performing gaze prediction
based on the previously-estimated gaze vectors. We report
gaze estimation and prediction results in terms of angular
error in degrees between estimated/predicted and ground
truth 3D gaze vectors.

For gaze estimation, we train a deep-CNN based on a
modiﬁed ResNet of 13 convolutional layers, as in [14]. The
CNN backbone was coupled with a 32-hidden unit fully con-
nected layer (FC) and a 2-hidden unit FC linear regression
layer, to estimate 2D gaze angles. To compensate for the
gaussian-like distribution of the data, we ﬁt a multivariate
Gaussian to the training set and weight the samples with
their inverse probability. The network was trained end-to-
end on 75% of the training data following such weighting
scheme for 50 epochs with ADAM optimizer, initial learning
rate of 0.001 and batch size of 32. For training, data was
randomly augmented in terms of brightness, horizontal and
vertical shifts and rotation. Model training and inference was
performed on downsampled images of 160×100 pixels. The
total number of parameters of the model was 206k and the
resulting model size is 828KB. The trained gaze estimation
network is tested on the validation set, obtaining an average
error of 4.58 degrees, which is in line with state-of-the-art
subject-independent approaches [15].

VI. CONCLUSION

We have presented OpenEDS2020, a novel dataset of
eye-image sequences consisting of up to 80 subjects of
varied appearance performing different gaze-elicited tasks.
The dataset consists of two subsets of data, one devoted
to gaze prediction and another devoted to eye semantic
segmentation, with the goal of fostering the exploitation of
spatio-temporal information to improve the current state of
the art on both tasks. Obtained results with proposed baseline
methods demonstrate the usefulness of the data, and serve as
a benchmark for future approaches coming from computer
vision, machine learning and eye tracking ﬁelds.
