Abstract

The emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has generated a need to quickly and
accurately assemble up-to-date information related to its spread. While it is possible to use
deaths to provide a reliable information feed, the latency of data derived from deaths is sig-
niﬁcant. Conﬁrmed cases derived from positive test results potentially provide a lower latency
data feed. However, the sampling of those tested varies with time and the reason for testing is
often not recorded. Hospital admissions typically occur around 1-2 weeks after infection and
can be considered out of date in relation to the time of initial infection. The extent to which
these issues are problematic is likely to vary over time and between countries.

We use a machine learning algorithm for natural language processing, trained in multiple
languages, to identify symptomatic individuals derived from social media and, in particular
Twitter, in real-time. We then use an extended SEIRD epidemiological model to fuse combi-
nations of low-latency feeds, including the symptomatic counts from Twitter, with death data
to estimate parameters of the model and nowcast the number of people in each compartment.
The model is implemented in the probabilistic programming language Stan and uses a bespoke
numerical integrator. We present results showing that using speciﬁc low-latency data feeds
along with death data provides more consistent and accurate forecasts of COVID-19 related
deaths than using death data alone.

1 Introduction

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), has at the time of writing, resulted in over 4.55 million deaths
and 219 million conﬁrmed cases worldwide as of 6th October 2021. By January 2020, new cases
had been seen throughout Asia, and by the time the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared
a global pandemic in March 2020, COVID-19 had spread to over 100 countries. Therefore, it was
imperative to establish reliable data feeds relating to the pandemic so that researchers and analysts
could model the ongoing spread of the disease and inform decision-making by government and

public health oﬃcials. These data sets and models must be open-source to facilitate collaboration
between researchers and allow for published results to be replicated and scrutinised. A popular
interactive dashboard that collates total daily counts of conﬁrmed cases and deaths for countries,
and in some cases, regions within countries exists here [1]. These variables are traditionally used
to calculate metrics such as the reproduction number (Rt), which is vital in understanding both
the number of people on average an infected person infects and the infection growth rate or daily
rate of new infections. The quality of the metrics calculated is heavily dependent on the model and
ingested data.

In the United Kingdom (UK), there has been a joint eﬀort to produce estimates of the (Rt)
number, with some notable examples seen here [2]. Laboratory-conﬁrmed COVID-19 diagnoses
are used in [3], UK’s National Health Service (NHS) Pathways data is used in [4] and hospital
admissions data is used in [5]. The statistical model developed by Moore, Rosato and Maskell [6]
contributed to these estimates by incorporating death, hospital admission and NHS 111 call data.
Terms such as “Infodemiology”, and “Infoveillance” described in [7] refer to the ability to process
and analyse data that is created and stored digitally in real-time pertinent to disease outbreaks.
The availability of these datasets, particularly at the beginning of an outbreak when very little is
known, could provide a noisy but accurate representation of disease dynamics. A popular method
includes extracting data from social media and, in particular, Twitter. Before the pandemic, tweets
relating to inﬂuenza-like-illness symptoms were seen to substantially improve the models predict-

pandemic, there have been many research papers published that use social media to gain valuable
information relating to the pandemic from what people tweet in real-time. Public sentiment re-
lating to prevention strategies was analysed in [10] while [11] showed that emotion changed from
fear to anger during the ﬁrst stages of the pandemic. Misinformation and conspiracy theories have
been shown to have propagated rapidly through the Twittersphere during the pandemic [12]. Stud-
ies have used machine learning algorithms to automatically detect tweets containing self-reported
symptoms mentioned by users [13] with [14] ﬁnding that the symptoms reported by Twitter users
were similar to those used in a clinical setting. To the best of our knowledge, researchers have yet
to use these symptomatic tweets to calibrate epidemiological models.

The contribution of this paper is twofold: ﬁrstly, we outline how to identify symptomatic tweets
that correspond to COVID-19 related symptoms in multiple languages. The geolocation informa-
tion associated with each tweet, when available, is extracted, and counts per country or region
are aggregated to produce estimates for the previous 24 hours. Secondly, we present a compre-
hensive study of how these symptomatic tweets diﬀer from other open-source datasets when used
to calibrate the extended SEIR model described in section 3 for diﬀerent geographic locations.
When incorporating the surveillance data, outlined in section 2, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
and Normalised Estimation Error Squared (NEES) values are calculated when making 7-day death
forecasts.

An outline of the paper is as follows.

In Section 2 we describe the open-source data feeds
included in the comparative study and provide the methodology for extracting the symptomatic
tweets in real-time. A description of the model is presented in Section 3, with an outline of the
computational experiments and results in Section 4. Concluding remarks and directions for future
work are described in Section 5.

2 Data

The surveillance data used for each geographical location are summarised in Table 1. Death and
positive case data for the US States and the rest of the world were downloaded from the dashboard
operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)
[1]. It should be noted that testing methods and criteria for classifying deaths as COVID-19-related
diﬀer between geographic locations.

For NHS region-speciﬁc data, the number of deaths includes individuals with COVID-19 as the
cause of death on their death certiﬁcate or those who died within 60 days of a positive test result.
Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms and individuals that input symptoms to
the ZOE COVID Symptom Study app comprise the hospital admissions and Zoe app datasets,
respectively. Individuals that reported symptoms via the NHS Pathways triage and online Dash-
board comprise the 111 calls and 111 online assessments datasets, respectively. Note that the Zoe
app, 111 calls and 111 online assessments may include individuals who have COVID-19 symptoms
but have not tested positive and individuals who perceive they have symptoms and do not have
COVID-19.

All code and datasets can be found on the CoDatMo GitHub repository [15]. The authors set

this up to facilitate the sharing of code, data and ideas when modelling COVID-19.

2.1 Twitter

We created an interactive website1 that maps symptomatic tweets to geographical locations with
daily counts representing the total amount of symptomatic tweets from the previous 24 hours.
Information on how to download the data as a JSON can be found on the website.

2.1.1 Pre-processing

The Twitter streaming API is ﬁltered using keywords that align with COVID-19 symptoms from the
MedDRA database [20] in English, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, including terms for
fever, cough and anosmia. We note that our analysis indicated that explicit COVID-19 terms (e.g.
‘coronavirus’) rarely related to individuals with symptoms. Such terms were therefore excluded.
Oﬃcial retweets or tweets beginning with #RT were removed to avoid duplication of tweets within
the dataset.

2.1.2 Symptom Classiﬁer Breakdown

A multi-class support vector machine (SVM) [21] was trained with a set of annotated tweets that
were vectorised using a skip-gram model. The annotated tweets were labelled according to the
following classes:

1. Unrelated tweet,

2. User currently has symptoms,

3. User had symptoms in the past,

4. Someone else currently has symptoms,

5. Someone else had symptoms in the past.

The sum of tweets in classes 2-5, which is the total number of tweets that mention symptoms,
was calculated for each 24-hour period. Geo-tagged tweets were mapped to their location, e.g.
the corresponding city, town or village, via a series of tests using shapeﬁles of diﬀerent countries.
Previous studies demonstrate that approximately 1.65% of tweets are geo-tagged [22], where the
exact position of the tweeter when the tweet was posted is recorded using longitude and latitude
measurements. For tweets that are not geo-tagged, we look at the author’s proﬁle to ascertain
whether they provide an appropriate location. We deemed the server oﬄine if there were any 15
minute periods during the previous 24 hours that did not have any recorded tweets. After checking
all 96 15 minute periods, the count in each geographical area was multiplied by a correction factor:
reported tweet count = total tweet count * 96/(96 - downtime periods).

For each language, we labelled the corpus of tweets with native speakers, with the associated
class label and randomly up- and down-sampled under- and over-represented classes such that the
classiﬁer was trained with a balanced dataset. A subset of data was used to train the classiﬁer before
testing it on the remainder. The total number of labelled tweets used for training and testing of
the classiﬁers and the resulting performance metrics can be seen in Table 2.

3 Model

We repurpose the statistical model developed by Moore, Rosato and Maskell [6] by tweaking the
observation model to be compatible with each group of surveillance data types that we use to
calibrate the model in the computational experiments. We calibrate the model with a minimum of
death data in all experiments, and the associated component of the observation model is unchanged.

4

We extend the observation model to assimilate the other types of surveillance data that feature in
Table 1, including Twitter and Zoe app data, by adding an extra component for each additional
data type. These extra components of the observation model, the number of which can change
between experiments, mirror the structure for symptom report data in the original model. More
explicitly, we assume for these extra components that a generic count on day t, xobs (t), has a
negative binomial distribution,

parameterised by a mean x (t) and overdispersion parameter φx.

xobs (t) ∼ NegativeBinomial (x (t) , φx) ,

4 Computational Experiments

The time series we consider begins on 17th February 2020, with the start dates of the data feeds
outlined in Table 1. We consider the end of time in our analysis for the US States and the rest of
the world and NHS regions to be the 1st February 2021 and 7th January 2021, respectively. In all
cases, we consider a forecast to include seven days. For US states and the rest of the world, we
include three predictions in the analysis; 9th July 2020 to 16th July 2020, 17th October 2020 to
24th October 2020 and 25th January 2021 - 1st February 2021. The analysis for UK NHS regions
includes six predictions; 11th November 2020 to 18th November 2020, 21st November 2020 - 28th
November 2020, 1st December - 8th December, 11th December - 18th December, 21st December -
28th December and 31st December 2020 - 7th January 2021.

Similar to the experiments in [6], the analysis in this paper was run on the University of Liver-
pool’s High-Performance Computer (HPC). Each node has two Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6138 CPU
@ 2.00GHz processors, a total of 40 cores and 384 GB of memory. In the following experiments,
six independent Markov Chains draw 2000 samples each, with the ﬁrst 1000 discarded as burn-in.
Run-time diﬀers depending on the country and at what point in the time series the prediction is
made, but it typically takes 4.5 hours per Markov Chain to complete.

We initially calibrate the model solely with death data and produce posterior predictive distri-

butions of deaths for the following geographic locations independently:

· US: 50 States,

· Rest of World: 2 European and 16 Latin American countries,

· UK: 7 NHS regions.

We consider the ﬁnal 7-daily deaths in this forecast to be the baseline to compare forecasts of deaths
when incorporating low-latency data feeds. We use two metrics in our analysis to determine the
accuracy of the resulting forecasts. Firstly, we calculate the MAE, which shows the average error
over a set of predictions:

MAE =

1
N

N
(cid:88)

i=1

(xi − yi),

(2)

where N is the number of predictions, and xi and yi are the predicted and true number of deaths
on day i, respectively.

5

Secondly, we consider the uncertainties associated with the forecasts by assessing the NEES,
which is a popular method in the ﬁeld of signal processing and tracking [23] and recently applied to
epidemiological forecasts in [6], to determine if the estimated variance of forecasts from an algorithm
diﬀers from the true variance. If the variance is larger than the true variance, then the algorithm is
over-cautious, and if the estimated variance is smaller than the true variance, it is over-conﬁdent.
The NEES is deﬁned by:

NEES =

1
N

N
(cid:88)

(xi − yi)T C i−1

(xi − yi),

i=1

(3)

where C i−1 is the estimated variance at day i, as approximated using the variance of the samples
for that day. If xi is D dimensional, then C i should be a D × D matrix, and the NEES should be
equal to D if the algorithm is consistent. Therefore, in assessing death forecasts, an ideal NEES
value is D ≈ 1.

4.1 Results

The NEES values and MAE percentage diﬀerences between the baseline, of ingesting solely deaths,
and the incorporation of low-latency data feeds for US States and the rest of the world and UK’s
NHS regions can be seen in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The results in these tables are averaged
over the prediction periods described in section 4.

When forecasting deaths using the data available from [1], we have shown that calibrating the
model with tests and tweets gives comparable increases in performance for US States, however for
the rest of the world, tweets give a -17% improvement compared to just -6% for tests. For US States
and the rest of the world, there is an improvement of -5% and -24%, respectively when tests and
tweets are used to calibrate the model. An example of this improvement can be seen in Figure 1 for
the prediction period 25th January 2021 - 1st February 2021. When comparing the mean sample,
outlined in red, incorporating tests and tweets follows the deaths trend with more accuracy.

When comparing the NEES values for NHS regions in Table 4 against the baseline, it is evident
that including a data feed improves the consistency of forecasts. The exception is the Zoe App data,
which on average, produces estimates that are over-conﬁdent. This can be seen in Figure 2 for the
prediction period 31st December 2020 - 7th January 2021. When comparing the MAE % diﬀerence,
the results are similar. Ingesting hospital admissions, 111 calls, and 111 online assessments data
provides improvements of -22%, -17% and -22%, respectively. However, there is a more signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in the MAE of 124% when including the Zoe App data than the 2% from including the
Tweet data. We perceive this issue arises because, in the context of these feeds, the symptoms are
self-diagnosed. Consequently, the counts may well include relatively large numbers of people who
do not have COVID-19. We do not currently consider such ‘false alarms’ in the model described in
section 3 but hope to extend it to handle these in the future.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

We have shown that calibrating the epidemiological model outlined in section 3 with certain low-
latency data feeds provides more accurate and consistent nowcasts of daily deaths when compared
with using death data alone.

Incorporating tweets for UK regions does not provide the same level of improvement as for other
geographies. This reduced improvement could be down to many factors, including the total daily
counts for NHS regions being less plentiful than for the US States or the rest of the world. We
used the free Twitter streaming API for this research, which limits the number of tweets available
to download to 1%. However, it is possible to pay for a Premium API that allows the user to
download a higher percentage of tweets. A second way to potentially increase the hit rate of
geo-located tweets is to use natural language processing techniques, such as those outlined in the
review [24], to estimate the location of the tweet user. Another direction for future work is to train

8

a more sophisticated classiﬁer such as the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
(BERT) classiﬁer [25].

As for the symptom report data in the original model that Moore, Rosato and Maskell intro-
duce [6], we have assumed that all types of low-latency surveillance data are a weighted sum of
current and lagged instances of the time series of new infections. We want to consider alternative
structures for the observation model that link directly to the intermediate states of the transmission
model in the future.
