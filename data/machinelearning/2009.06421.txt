Abstract. 

In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid model for predicting the compressive strength of concrete using 

ultrasonic pulse  velocity  (UPV)  and  rebound  number  (RN).  First,  516  data  from  8  studies  of  UPV  and 

rebound hammer (RH) tests  was collected. Then, high  correlated  variables  creator machine (HVCM) is 

used to create the new variables that have a better correlation with the output and improve the prediction 

models. Three single models, including a step-by-step regression (SBSR), gene expression programming 

(GEP) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as well as three hybrid models, i.e. HCVCM-

SBSR,  HCVCM-GEP  and  HCVCM-ANFIS,  were  employed  to  predict  the  compressive  strength  of 

concrete. The statistical parameters and error terms such as coefficient of determination, root mean square 

error (RMSE), normalized mean square error (NMSE), fractional bias, the maximum positive and negative 

errors, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), were computed to evaluate and compare the models. 

The results show that HCVCM-ANFIS can predict the compressive strength of concrete better than all other 

models.  HCVCM  improves  the  accuracy  of  ANFIS  by  5%  in  the  coefficient  of  determination,  10%  in 

RMSE, 3% in NMSE, 20% in MAPE, and 7% in the maximum negative error. 

Keywords: adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), gene expression programming (GEP), step-

by-step regression (SBSR), ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), rebound number (RN), rebound hammer (RH).

1.  Introduction 

Thanks to its low cost, concrete is among the most widely used building materials in the world. Estimating 

the properties of hardened concrete has been the topic of numerous studies [1]. The compressive strength 

is  a  key  property  of  concrete  and  directly related to the safety  of the  structure.  Evaluating  the concrete 

compressive strength (CCS) is a common requirement in quality control and performance determination of 

existing structures during their entire life cycle. Strength test results also may be a necessity after a structural 

failure, such as environmental degradation or fire damage [2]. 

Methods to estimate the mechanical properties of concrete can be classified into destructive tests (DTs) and 

non-destructive tests (NDTs). Usually, cubic or cylinder specimen are prepared and cured to measure the 

compressive strength of fresh concrete in accordance with procedures described in ASTM standard test 

methods [3,4]. Different concrete mixtures lead to different properties, and reproducibility of the test results 

is of major importance [5–8]. Although DTs, such as core tests, are commonly used, they have several 

drawbacks. They are expensive, time-consuming and have ‘locally destructive effects’ on the structures. 

They are also only representative for small structures and conducting these tests are sometimes  difficult 

due to accessing of the coring machine [9]. 

NDTs  are  widely  used  to  evaluate  the  fundamental  characteristics  of  concrete  in  structures,  such  as 

compressive  strength.  NDTs  do  not  cause  any  damage  to  the  structure  and  do  not  affect  the  structural 

performance [10]. Many different types of NDTs have been developed in order to measure the compressive 

strength of concrete, among them the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and rebound hammer (RH) tests. 

These methods  are simple yet effective  and  can  be  used for  quality control  of concrete  in  structures  or 

confirm the uniformity of the material from one part to another [11–13]. 

UPV is a common and fast test without any damage on concrete. It was presented and proposed by ASTM 

C 597 and BS 1881: Part 203 [4,14]. This test is one of the suitable approaches to check the uniformity of 

concrete quickly, and it can be applied in various parts of reinforced concrete (RC) elements. This test can 

determine the properties of used concrete in structures and also specify the presence of voids and internal 

cracks [15]. The results of this test depend on several factors, including the percentage of components of 

2 

 
the mix proportion, properties of aggregates, steel bars, cracks, voids and fibers. On the other hand, some 

studies report high uncertainties of the results of UPV to estimate the compressive strength of concrete 

[16,17]. 

The RH test is one of the most used non-destructive tests because of its simplicity. This test was presented 

by ASTM C 805, and BS 1881: Part 202 [14,18]. In this test method, a spring-loaded mass, which has a 

fixed amount of energy, is released. The traveled distance by this mass is defined as a percentage of the 

initial spring extension. This value is defined through a rebound number (RN). The determined RNs depend 

on the percentage of components of mix proportions, surface texture, surface wetness of the concrete and 

properties of the aggregate, although the RN is the reflection of the concrete surface [11,19,20]. 

Sometimes, a combination of UPV and RH methods is used for better prediction of concrete compressive 

strength, which is also known as the SonReb method. UPV and RH tests are both sensitive to the variations 

in  the  concrete  properties,  especially  in  opposite  directions.  UPV  tests  provide  information  about  the 

interior concrete properties whereas the RH test results usually predict concrete strength near the surface. 

Consequently,  using  the  combination  of  two  methods  for  the  prediction  can  lead  to  more  accurate  and 

reliable results [19,21]. 

2.  Theoretical background 

Introducing precise and reliable models for predicting the CCS would lead to saving both costs and time. 

In this regard, many researchers have used several models to estimate the compressive strength of concrete 

[22–27]. Based on the results of the previous studies, computational modeling, artificial intelligence (AI), 

and parametric multi-variable regression models are three groups of techniques that are commonly used to 

predict  concrete  strength  using  the  UPV  and  RH  outputs.  Computational  modeling  is  based  on  the 

mathematical modeling of complex physical phenomena and often encounter some difficulties due to the 

complexity  of  the  models  or  the  time  consuming  numerical  computation  [28].  In  this  regard,  several 

equations were established by researchers for predicting concrete compressive strength; however, most of 

them require previous knowledge of concrete ingredients to achieve reliable results. Among them, Rashid 

3 

 
and  Waqas  [11]  established  a  relationship  between  UPV  with  compressive  strength  and  RN  with 

compressive  strength.  Ahmadi-Nedushan  proposes  an  optimized  instance-based  learning  approach  for 

prediction of the compressive strength of high performance concrete based on mix data, such as water to 

binder ratio, water content, super-plasticizer content, fly ash content [27]. In recent years, AI methods and 

machine  learning  (ML)  techniques  have  been  used  frequently  to  predict  the  CCS  without  knowing  the 

theoretical relationships between the input and the output. Several researchers have employed AI methods 

to predict the mechanical properties of different types of concrete using detail of mix proportion and UPV 

[24,24,28–30]. Tenza-Abril et al. used an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) for prediction and sensitivity 

analysis of compressive strength in segregated lightweight concrete using UPV [31]. Ashrafian [32] utilized 

heuristic  regression  methods  as  a  hybrid  method  in  the  prediction  of  both  strength  and  UPV  for  fiber 

reinforced concrete. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is also a strong model for predicting 

the performance of concrete. For example, the properties of rubberized concrete, compressive strength and 

splitting tensile strength of concrete containing silica fume and recycled aggregate at 3, 7, 14, 28, and 90 

days, and compressive strength of no-slump concrete were predicted using ANFIS [23,33,34]. Cevik (2011) 

employed ANFIS to predict the increased strength of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) confined concrete 

[35]. Several researchers used several methods, including ANFIS, ANN, and group method, to estimate the 

compressive strength of concrete based on the results of core tests. The used variables include length-to-

diameter ratio, core diameter, aggregate size, and concrete age [36]. 

Parametric multi-variable regression models are another group of methods to predict CCS. Specifically, the 

confidence interval of a prediction calculated by a parametric regression model reveals the accuracy of the 

estimation, and the statistics of the model parameters can indicate how each variable in the model influences 

the prediction [37]. Kewalramani [16], used a regression analysis to predict the compressive strength of 

concrete based on acoustic characteristics like UPV and damping constant.   

The main target of this study is a comparison of the accuracy and performance of two new proposed models 

and two available models in predicting the compressive strength of concrete using RN and UPV. First, the 

data is collected from 8 previous studies. Second, the step by step regression (SBSR), GEP, and ANFIS are 

4 

 
used as an individual model to predict the compressive strength. SBSR model is introduced and used for 

the  first  time.  Third,  high  correlated  variable  creator  machine  (HCVCM)  is  used  to  generate  the  new 

variables, which can improve the accuracy and performance of the models. HCVCM is also introduced and 

utilized for the first time. Using the combination of HCVCM and the used models in previous steps, three 

hybrid models, including HCVCM-SBSR, HCVCM-GEP, and HCVCM-ANFIS, are created and used to 

predict  the  compressive  strength.  The  statistical  parameters  and  error  terms,  including  coefficient  of 

determination,  root  mean  square  error  (RMSE),  normalized  square  error  (NMSE),  fractional  bias,  the 

maximum positive and negative errors, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), are used to evaluate 

and compare the models. The statistical parameters and error terms are used to compare the models. It is 

clear that using HCVCM and SBSR is the novelty of this study. 

3.  Materials and methods 

 The  main  target  of  this  study  is  related  to  the  comparison  accuracy  and  performance  of  two  unknown 

models and two known models in predicting the compressive strength of concrete using RN and UPV. First, 

the values of RN, UPV and compressive strength of concrete from 8 previous studies are collected. Then, 

an  unknown  regression  model  namely  SBSR,  GEP,  and  ANIFS  are  utilized  to  predict  the  compressive 

strength of concrete using the initial input variables, including the values of RN and UPV. Subsequently, 

HCVCM is used to propose several new variables. The proposed new variables by HCVCM are imported 

as input variables in SBSR, GEP, and ANFIS; therefore, HCVCM-SBSR, HCVCM-GEP, and HCVCM-

ANFIS can be regarded as hybrid models. The results of single models are compared with the results of the 

hybrid models. 70% of the dataset, which is selected to train models randomly, is the same for all models. 

After training the models, the remaining dataset is predicted using the trained models.

56, and 90 days [9,10,13,15,17,38–40].

Table  2  shows  the  coefficient  of  determination  between  the  input  variables  and  also  the  coefficient  of 

determination between the inputs and output. The coefficient of determination is a statistical measurement 

that  examines  how  differences  in  one  variable  can  be  explained  by  the  difference  in  a  second  variable 

[41,42].  In  other  words,  this  coefficient  assesses  how  strong  the  linear  relationship  is  between  two 

parameters. The optimal value of the coefficient of determination between an input and the output is 1. 

Several input variables might have the same coefficient of determination with the output. In these cases, if 

the coefficient of determination between these input variables is close to 1, it means that the input variables 

represent the same properties and data. Table 2 shows the values of the coefficient of determination between 

8 

 
 
 
 
each  input  and  output  and  between  input  variables.  The  results  show  that  the  input  variables  are 

independent, and RN has a better correlation with the compressive strength of concrete.

In  this  study,  three  single  algorithms  and  three  hybrid  algorithms  are  used  to  predict  the  compressive 

strength of concrete using RN and PUV. The single algorithms include SBSR, GEP and ANFIS. The hybrid 

models  are  created  by  combining  HCVCM  and  each  single  algorithm.  70%  of  the  dataset  is  selected 

randomly to train the models. Then, they are used to predict the remaining dataset. 

3.2.1.  Step by step regression (SBSR) 

 Step by Step Regression (SBSR) 

SBSR  is a  new  regression model,  which  focuses  on  coefficient  of  determination  between variables  and 

output to improve the accuracy of the obtained model. Fig 3. shows a SBSR model for three variables. In 

the first step, the coefficient of determination between each input variable and output is calculated. Then, 

the variables are sorted based on the obtained values of coefficient of determination. The variable with the 

highest coefficient of determination is imported in cell 1, and the variables with the smallest coefficient of 

determination is placed in the last cell. In the second step, a linear regression is used to predict the output 

in each cell. As shown in Fig 3, the predicted output of each cell is imported as a new variable in the next 

cell. In the third step, the predicted outputs in all cells are imported as input variables to predict the actual 

9 

 
 
 
output. In all cells, the constant parameters of the regression model are obtained using the mean square 

error (MSE) technique. Equations (1)-(3) show the used regression model in the first cell, middle cells, and 

the final cells, respectively. Equation (4) represent the regression model in the final step.

denote the constant variable of the regression model, i.e. 

where the superimposed ‘T’ refers to the transpose.

GEP has been introduced by [43]. It consists of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Genetic Programming (GP) 

[43] and is a strong tool to predict  various phenomena and material properties. This model is created by

using a set of different functions and terminals. A set of different functions, which are used in this study, 

includes the basic functions, inverse trigonometric function, trigonometric functions, exponential function, 

hyperbolic function, user-defined functions and a combination of them. A set of terminals consists of input 

variables, their combination and constant values. In this approach, a random population of data is used by 

GA to find a suitable function to predict the output, which is the compressive strength of concrete in this 

study. GA selects the suitable input variables and functions between all functions and input variables to 

estimate the output. Several operators, named genes, are used for performing Genetic variations. Based on 

the GEP algorithm, the Roulette wheel selects data. Several genes reproduce the data. In the duplication 

process, the genes avoid unsuitable data and transfer the suitable data to create the next generation. The 

main  target  of  the  mutation  operator  is  related  to  the  internal  random  optimization  of  the  given 

chromosomes. Fig 4 explains the process of GEP.

3.2.3.  Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) 

Fuzzy system is a rule-based system, which is created by selecting linguistic rules. This system has suitable 

accuracy in predicting material performance. Two kinds of fuzzy inference system (FIS) were used in most 

applications, i.e. Sugeno fuzzy and Mamdani models. Their defuzzification and aggregation approaches are 

different; therefore, the results of fuzzy rules are various for these systems. In the present investigation, the 

rule is defined as a linear combination of input parameters, and the final output equals to the weighted mean 

of outputs for each rule. For example, A Sugeno FIS, which includes an output (f), and two input parameters 

(y and x), is represented as follows: 

(5) 

(6) 

where B1, B2, A1, and A2 are the labels presenting the membership functions (MFs) for the inputs x and 

y, respectively; ri, qi, and pi designate as the output membership function parameters (OMFPs), which are 

the consequent parameters of 𝑖th rule. 

The performance and accuracy of the fuzzy systems are related to the used rule based and the parameters 

such as the MFs, and they are tuned and adjusted using the combination of ANN with fuzzy system to create 

neuro-fuzzy system. On the other hand, a neuro-fuzzy system includes the learning processes in ANN and 

the fuzzy systems; thus, this model has the advantage of both models. ANFIS is one of these combinations, 

which  uses  an  adaptive  back  propagation  learning  procedure  for  adjusting  the  parameters  in  the  fuzzy 

systems [44]. In other words, ANFIS utilizes a linguistic model containing a set of If-Then fuzzy rules and 

the fuzzy sets to present the human-like reasoning style of a fuzzy system [45]. Fig 5 (a) demonstrates the 

general architecture of the ANFIS model, which include two input parameters, and Fig  5 (b) shows the 

fuzzy reasoning mechanism.  

The rule base of ANFIS, including two Fuzzy If-Then rules of Sugeno and Takagi, is assumed as below 

[46,47]:

Each layers’ functions are explained as follows: 

The first Layer: Each node (i) in the first layer is a square node with a node function: 

(7) 

(8) 

(9) 

where O denotes the output of each node in this layer; x and Ai are the input variable to node (i) and 

the label to present the MFs for the input, respectively. The Gaussian membership functions (GMFs), 

used here are given by 

(10) 

(11) 

and 

being the premise parameters, which are governed form GMFs. 

The second layer: Each node in the second layer is a circle node, which is labeled as N that multiplies the 

output signals, and their outputs are calculated as follows: 

(12) 

In this layer, the outputs of the nodes show the firing weight of the rules. 

The third layer: Each node in the third layer is defined as a circle node, which is labeled as N that plays a 

normalization  role.  The  𝑖th  node  calculates  the  ratio  of  the  firing  weight  of  the  𝑖th  rule  to  the 

summation of the firing weights of all rules as:

The fourth layer: Each node in the fourth layer is a square node with a node function. Each output of this 

layer is determined as: 

(14) 

The parameters of layer 4 are related to as consequent parameters.  

The fifth layer: There is one circle node in layer 5, which is a fixed node labeled by

, and defined as the 

signal node. This node computes the overall output, which is obtained from the summation of all incoming 

signals as  

(15) 

There are two approaches in ANFIS. The first is a back propagation for all parameters. The second is a 

hybrid approach, which includes a least squares estimation for the parameters associated with the OMFPs 

and a back propagation for the parameters associated with the input MFs [46].

3.2.4.  High correlated variables creator machine (HCVCM) 

HCVCM is a new algorithm to create the new variables from the initial variables improving the performance 

of model. There are three steps in this method. In the first step, the new variables are created using several 

mathematical, trigonometric functions, their combinations and user-defined functions. In the second step, 

the coefficient of determination between new variables and outputs is determined. The new variables with 

highest coefficient of determination with the output are imported to the third steps. In the third step, the 

new  variables  are  selected  and  imported  to  the  prediction  models  with  the  lowest  coefficient  of 

determination  between  the  initial  variables.  HCVCM  can  contain  several  generations.  Fig  6.  shows  the 

process of the first generation in HCVCM. Only new variables, which are selected in the first generation, 

15 

 
 
 
are imported as input variables in our hybrid models. In the second generation, new variables can be created 

using the new selected variables in generation 1. 

Fig 6. The process in HCVCM 

3.2.5.  Using HCVCM in prediction models 

HCVCM is used before SBSR, GEP, and ANFIS to create the new variables, which finally improves the 

accuracy of the models. First, better variables are specified based on HCVCM. Then, these variables are 

imported to SBSR, GEP, and ANFIS. Based on the results of HCVCM, the R2 value of 6 new variables 

created form UPV will be higher compared to the f R2 value of UPV. Moreover, the R2 value of the new 

RN will be higher than the old R2 value. The functions, which are used to create these new variables from 

UPV and RN, are shown in table 3.

As mentioned in section 3.2.4, not only the coefficient of determination between the new variables and the 

output should be higher than the coefficient of determination between the initial variable and the output, 

but also the coefficient of determination between the new variables should be lower than the coefficient of 

determination between the initial variables. Therefore, as shown in tables 3 and 4, the new variables are 

selected, which pass these two rules.

4.  Results 

As mentioned before, 70% of the dataset was used to train the models, then the model was utilized to predict 

the remaining. The same data was used to train all models. Table 5 summarizes the statistical parameters 

of six models in the training and testing dataset. ANFIS performs better than all the other single models 

with respect to all statistical parameters in the training dataset, and SBSR is better than GEP according to 

the coefficient of determination, RMSE, and NMSE. In contrast, GEP performs better than the other single 

models in the testing dataset. Although the coefficient of determination of SBSR is better than those of 

ANFIS in the testing dataset, ANFIS shows better results with respect to RMSE and NMSE. The results 

show that the best single model based on statistical parameter cannot be selected. 

17 

 
 
 
As table 5 demonstrates, HCVCM positively affects the results of SBSR and ANFIS because not only the 

R^2 value increases – compared to the associated single models, but also the RMSE and NMSE are less. 

HCVCM-GEP performs better than GEP in the training dataset, although in the testing dataset, GEP yields 

better results in the RMSE and coefficient of determination.

Table 6 lists the error terms including the maximum positive error, maximum negative error and MAPE. 

ANFIS is the best single model. HCVCM-ANFIS performs better than ANFIS with respect to  the error 

term. It also leads to better results compared to HCVCM-SBSR and HCVCM-GEP. The maximum positive 

and negative errors of HCVCM-SBSR are less than those of HCVCM-GEP, but MAPE of HCVCM-GEP 

is less than those of HCVCM-SBSR. The results show that HCVCM is more useful when this method is 

used with SBSR and ANFIS.

Fig 7 (a) shows the comparison of the actual compressive strength and the predicted values using SBSR 

and HCVCM-SBSR. The HCVCM-SBSR results better predict the actual compressive strength. Fig 7(b) 

depicts the error of these models. HCVCM decreases the error in SBSR. Figs. 8 (c) and (d) compare the 

predicted compressive strength by GEP and HCVCM-GEP with the actual compressive strength. HCVCM 

is obviously not useful for GEP because GEP was not used the new variables, which were proposed by 

HCVCM. On the other hand, GEP changed all new variables, which were created by HCVCM; therefore, 

the results of HCVCM-GEP cannot improve the results of GEP. Fig 7 (e) shows the predicted compressive 

strength using ANFIS and HCVCM-ANFIS whereas Fig. 7 (f) illustrates the obtained errors from ANFIS 

and HCVCM-ANFIS.

5.  Conclusion 

 In this study, three single models, including SBSR, GEP, and ANFIS, and three hybrid models, including 

HCVCM-SBSR, HCVCM-GEP, and HCVCM-ANFIS, were used to predict the compressive strength of 

516 concrete samples with various UPV and RN. In the following, the main findings are summarized: 

1-  HCVCM aims to produce better variables with respect to the coefficient of determination between 

the new variables and the output. On the other hand, the coefficient of determination between new 

input variables and outputs is more than those between the initial variables and output. 

2-   Selecting the new variables with lowest correlation to each other and highest correlation with the 

output can improve the accuracy of the models. 

3-  HCVCM improves the accuracy of SBSR and ANFIS to predict the compressive strength of 

concrete. 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
4-  HCVCM is an adaptive method for GEP in predicting the compressive strength of concrete.  

5-  HCVCM improve the accuracy SBSR 2.6% in coefficient of determination, 6.5% in RMSE, 

3.75% in NMSE, 11.4% in MAPE, 69.2% in maximum positive error, and 8.9% in the maximum 

negative error. 

6-  HCVCM-ANFIS is selected as the best model to predict the compressive strength of concrete, 

HCVCM improve the accuracy ANFIS 5% in coefficient of determination, 10% in RMSE, 3% in 

NMSE, 20% in MAPE, and 7% in the maximum negative error.
