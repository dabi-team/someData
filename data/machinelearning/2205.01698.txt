Variational quantum algorithms are the centerpiece of modern quantum programming. These
algorithms involve training parameterized quantum circuits using a classical co-processor, an ap-
proach adapted partly from classical machine learning. An important subclass of these algorithms,
designed for combinatorial optimization on currrent quantum hardware, is the quantum approxi-
mate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Despite eﬀorts to realize deeper circuits, experimental state
of the art implementations are limited to ﬁxed depth. However, it is known that problem density—a
problem constraint to variable ratio—induces under-parametrization in ﬁxed depth QAOA. Density
dependent performance has been reported in the literature, yet the circuit depth required to achieve
ﬁxed performance (henceforth called critical depth) remained unknown. Here, we propose a predic-
tive model, based on a logistic saturation conjecture for critical depth scaling with respect to density.
Focusing on random instances of MAX-2-SAT, we test our predictive model against simulated data
with up to 15 qubits. We report the average critical depth, required to attain a success probability
of 0.7, saturates at a value of 10 for densities beyond 4. We observe the predictive model to describe
the simulated data within a 3σ conﬁdence interval. Furthermore, based on the model, a linear trend
for the critical depth with respect problem size is recovered for the range of 5 to 15 qubits.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The quantum approximate optimization algorithm
(QAOA) was introduced to solve combinatorial optimiza-
tion problems by Farhi et al. [1]. In this algorithm, the
candidate solution is prepared using a ﬁxed ansatz struc-
ture with tunable parameters that are variationally ad-
justed to minimize an objective function. QAOA was in-
spired by adiabatic quantum computation [2–4], where a
system prepared in the ground state of an initial Hamil-
tonian evolves towards the ground state of a problem
Hamiltonian, given a slow enough evolution. The circuit
structure of QAOA shares resemblance to adiabatic evo-
lution via a ﬁnite depth Trotterization procedure, and
thus allows for recovering the exact ground state of the
problem Hamiltoninan in the inﬁnite depth limit. In con-
trast, a ﬁxed p–depth QAOA circuit, consists of alter-
nating applications of the complex exponentiation of the
problem Hamiltonian and a so called mixer Hamiltonian,
accounting for 2p variational parameters.

Although QAOA recovers adiabatic evolution in the in-
ﬁnite depth limit, short depth circuits have indeed been
shown to oﬀer some beneﬁts in approximating solutions
to low density instances of combinatorial optimization
problems [1, 5, 6]. Farhi et al. [1] studied the perfor-
mance of QAOA applied to the MAX-CUT problem on
3-regular graphs and reported that for p = 1, QAOA
guarantees a cut that is at least 0.6924 of the optimal
cut. Furthermore, the quality of approximation is shown
to improve with increasing p. Beyond combinatorial op-
timization problems, Farhi and Harrow [7] reported that

∗ akshay.vishwanathan@skoltech.ru

the split operator structure of QAOA might be a suit-
able candidate for establishing quantum supremacy, since
the output distributions of such circuits may not be ef-
ﬁciently sampled classically. Moreover, in the works of
Jiang et al. [8] and Morales et al. [9], the O(
N ) query
complexity of Grover’s algorithm is recovered by a class
of QAOA circuits, thus establishing quantum advantage
within the QAOA framework. These along with univer-
sality results [10–12] make QAOA a promising model for
NISQ era devices.

√

Although several advantages have been reported [1, 5–
9, 13–15], eﬀects limiting the performance of QAOA have
also been discovered [16–18]. Considering the energy er-
ror in approximation as a performance metric, Akshay
et al. [16, 17] demonstrated reachability deﬁcits, an eﬀect
limiting performance for ﬁxed depth QAOA on high den-
sity problem instances. Deeper circuits therefore become
a necessity and hence come with overheads in classical
outerloop optimization. While approaches such as layer-
wise training aim to reduce this classical computational
cost, Campos et al. [18] showed that such a strategy
would not improve performance beyond some threshold
depth. Other approaches aimed at reducing the classical
computation cost exploit what are known as concentra-
tion eﬀects [19–22]. Although these eﬀects allows one
to heuristically guess near-optimal parameters at ﬁxed
depth and for increasing number of qubits, they fail to ad-
dress the depth required to guarantee ﬁxed performance.

Here we propose a logistic saturation conjecture which
states that the minimum depth required for QAOA to
achieve ﬁxed performance up to some tolerance (hence-
forth called critical depth) scales logistically with prob-
lem density. We numerically test this conjecture for the
case of MAX-2-SAT with up to 15 qubits and maximum
density of 4, and observe (i) the predictive model de-

 
 
 
 
 
 
scribes the simulated data within a 3σ conﬁdence inter-
val and (ii) the critical depth scales linearly with problem
size in this dataset.

II. BACKGROUND

A. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm

The objective function of a combinatorial optimization
problem is prescribed as a map from the assignment of
variables to non-negative real numbers C : {0, 1}×n →
R+. Under a vector space embedding [23, 24], the ob-
jective function then induces a corresponding problem
Hamiltonian Hc, which encodes the solutions to the prob-
lem instance in its ground state space,

2

prior knowledge of optimal solutions. However, it can
be demonstrated that both metrics inter-relate and there-
fore have some advantages as a theoretical tool for study-
ing algorithmic performance.

Let H† = H ≥ 0 be an optimization problem in-
stance with d-degenerate ground state energy λ0. In its
j=1 |φj(cid:105)(cid:104)φj| +
eigenbasis |φj(cid:105), we can write H = λ0
(cid:80)
k>d λk |φk(cid:105)(cid:104)φk|, with subsequent excited state ener-
gies, λ0 < λk ≤ λmax for k > d, separated by a gap
∆ = mink>d |λ0 − λk|. For any arbitrary state |ψ(cid:105), the
ground state overlap is calculated as:

(cid:80)d

g(ψ) =

d
(cid:88)

j=1

|(cid:104)φj|ψ(cid:105)|2.

(5)

Hc =

(cid:88)

C(z) |z(cid:105)(cid:104)z| ,

z∈{0,1}×n

(1)

It is straightforward now to derive (see Appendix B)
the bounds relating the energy error in approximations
(cid:104)ψ| H |ψ(cid:105) − λ0, and the ground state overlap g(ψ):

where |z(cid:105) are the computational basis vectors in the 2n
dimensional Hilbert space of n qubits.

The optimization problem aims to ﬁnd assignments
such that the objective function C(z) is minimized. This
is equivalent to ﬁnding a state |z∗(cid:105) such that

|z∗(cid:105) ∈ span{ arg min
z∈{0,1}×n

(cid:104)z| Hc |z(cid:105)}.

(2)

Measuring the state |z∗(cid:105) in the computational basis out-
puts a bitstring which is a solution to the optimization
problem, C.

To approximate solutions to an optimization prob-
lem instance using a p-depth QAOA circuit, we gener-
ate ansatz states |ψ(γ, β)(cid:105) on a quantum computer with
tunable real parameters γ, β ∈ [0, 2π)×p, [0, π)×p. These
states are prepared by applying an alternating sequence
of 2p parameterized unitary gates on the initial state

The ansatz state in Eq. (3) is iteratively adjusted via
an outer-loop optimization routine to obtain an energy
approximation as:

min

(cid:104)ψ(γ, β)| Hc |ψ(γ, β)(cid:105) ≥ min (Hc) .

(4)

Algorithmic performance of QAOA can be assessed
under performance metrics such as (i) energy error in
approximation and (ii) ground state overlap [16–18].
Both these quantiﬁers feature shortcomings as energy
approximations fail to indicate closeness to optimal so-
lutions while computing ground state overlap requires

(6)

Note that the relation works when the error in approxi-
mation is less than the spectral gap ∆. These bounds are
the extended version of the variational stability lemma in
[10] to the degenerate case and allows one to recover an
estimate on the ground state overlap from the measured
energy.

B. Satisﬁability

Boolean satisﬁability or SAT, is the problem of deter-
mining satisﬁability of Boolean formulae. More speciﬁ-
cally, one aims to decide whether a given formula can be
satisﬁed by assigning truth values to the variables. Lim-
ited to k-variables or literals per clause, and expressed
in the conjunctive normal form (CNF), k-SAT is NP-
complete for k ≥ 3 [25]. k-SAT clauses are randomly
generated to form instances by uniformly selecting unique
k-tuples from the union of a variable set (cardinality
n > k) and its element wise negation. Generated ran-
dom instances admit an order parameter called clause or
problem density given by,

α = m/n,

(7)

where m is the number of clauses and n is the number of
Boolean variables in the k-SAT instance.

The clause density plays an important role in the study
of satisﬁability phase transitions. It has been observed
that for random k-SAT instances, an abrupt change in
satisﬁability occurs at some critical clause density, αc.
Though this criticality has been studied only empirically
for 3-SAT (αc ≈ 4.27), it is proven for 2-SAT [26]. Fur-
thermore, it is observed that the computational resources
required for SAT solvers increase at the transition point

3

with an easy-hard-easy pattern. This behaviour suggest
that the hard instances concentrate around the critical
clause density [26–31].

In this work we focus on the optimization version of k-
SAT, otherwise called MAX-k-SAT. MAX-k-SAT is the
canonical NP-hard optimization problem (for k ≥ 2) [32]
where one seeks to determine variable assignments that
maximize the number of satisﬁed clauses in a given in-
stance. Similar to decision k-SAT, MAX-k-SAT also fea-
tures a phase transition with an easy-hard pattern [33].
Although the point of criticality diﬀers for the optimiza-
tion and decision variants of these problems, they coin-
cide for k = 2 with αc = 1 [34].

With standard Ising embedding techniques [23, 24],
MAX-2-SAT instances can be mapped onto 2-local Ising
Hamiltonians of the form:

Motivated by these ﬁndings, we propose a logistic sat-

uration conjecture:
Given some ﬁxed tolerance on performance, (cid:15) > 0. For
QAOA on instances characterized by density α, the crit-
ical depth p∗, required to guarantee approximations that
fall within an (cid:15) tolerance is given by:

p∗(α) = min{p | f(p, α, n) ≤ (cid:15)}.

(11)

We conjecture the critical depth to scale with density as,

p∗(α) ≈

pmax
1 + e−κ(α−αc)

,

(12)

where αc is the critical density, κ the logistic growth rate,
and pmax the saturation value.

IV. RESULTS

We ﬁrst recover the ﬁndings of [16, 17] in Figure 1 by
studying the performance of ﬁxed depth QAOA on 300
randomly generated MAX-2-SAT instances on 15 vari-
ables and clauses ranging from 1 to 60 (α ∈ [0.06, 4.0]).

with appropriate coeﬃcients and scale such that: (i) for
satisﬁable assignments, |z(cid:105), (cid:104)z| H |z(cid:105) = 0 and (ii) for un-
satisﬁable assignments (cid:104)z| H |z(cid:105) = m(cid:48), where m(cid:48) is the
number of clauses violated by the assignment. A de-
tailed construction of such Hamiltonians is shown in Ap-
pendix A. By construction, the ground state space of H
is spanned by assignments that violate the least number
of clauses in a given MAX-2-SAT instance.

III. LOGISTIC SATURATION CONJECTURE

The state space which can be prepared with a p-depth

QAOA circuit is deﬁned as,

Ω =

(cid:91)

γ,β

|ψ(γ, β)(cid:105) ,

(9)

with |ψ(γ, β)(cid:105) given by Eq. (3). In general, for a given in-
stance size n, density α and depth p, the variational state
space may not cover the whole Hilbert space. There-
fore, optimization over Ω may not converge to the exact
ground state energy. The diﬀerence, or the energy error
in approximation,

variables. Data points represent the average value obtained
over statistics of 300 random instances with error bars repre-
senting 3σ for the estimated mean. Colors indicate varying
QAOA depths p = {5, 10, 15}, illustrating improved perfor-
mance at higher depths.

quantiﬁes performance of p-depth QAOA. Whenever
f (p, α, n) > 0, QAOA suﬀers a reachability deﬁcit. This
behaviour has been studied in [16, 17], and it is ob-
served that the onset of these deﬁcits correspond to the
phase transition criticality of the considered optimiza-
tion problem. For the case of MAX-2-SAT, it was shown
that f (p, α, n) grows with increasing clause density be-
yond αc ≈ 1. Though better performance is achieved at
the cost of increasing QAOA depth, a similar trend for
deﬁcits is reﬂected.

Numerically,
it is seen that the average performance
worsens monotonically with increasing clause density.
This is also evident (see Fig. 2) for the case of ground
state overlap as described by stability bounds in Eq. (6).
It becomes apparent that for guaranteeing ﬁxed perfor-
mance, the QAOA depth must necessarily increase with
increasing clause density.

To test the logistic saturation conjecture, we numeri-
cally calculate the depth required to attain performance
within an (cid:15) tolerance. This is done by incrementing
depth, until the energy error in approximations falls
f(p, α, n) ≤ (cid:15). For each instance
within acceptance,

ered critical density αc ≈ 1, and growth rate κ, show very
little variability with respect to number of qubits.
In con-
trast, the the saturation value pmax illustrates a linear trend
in the considered range of 5 to 15 qubits.

this process is repeated and the average critical depth
is calculated. Figure 3 illustrates scaling of the average
critical depth with respect to clause density and com-
pares the numerical data against the predictive model in
Eq. (12). We see that the model is able to match the
numerical data well within a 3σ conﬁdence interval for
the estimated mean.

We further investigate the reliability of the predictive
model by treating the critical density as a ﬁtting parame-
ter in Eq. (12) and compare against the theoretical value
of αc ≈ 1. In Figure 4 ﬁtting parameters are recovered
for n = 5 up to 15 and indeed we see the critical density
recovered from the predictive model matches the theo-
retical value up to ﬁnite size variations.

points represent the average p∗ calculated according to Eq.
(11) across problem density for MAX-2-SAT with tolerance

{5, 10, 15} with errorbars representing 3σ for the estimated
mean. Solid curves represent the least squares ﬁt of the data
to the predictive model as described in Eq. (12).

V. NUMERICAL DETAILS

The computationally intensive calculations were per-
formed on the KunLun supercomputer with a maximum
CPU frequency of 2.1 GHz. The code was written in
Python and C++. Python code is responsible for pro-
viding easy-to-use interfaces and C++ code is responsible
for the actual simulation tasks as the underlying simula-
tion code. The code executed in parallel with a resource
of 1500 cores. The calculations were performed for 300
random instances for each respective problem density.

We used a heuristic optimisation strategy, motivated
by layerwise training, to ﬁnd good initial parameteriza-
tion for the ansatz such that gradient based classical op-
timizers may avoid most local minima.

In order to ﬁnd optimal parameters for depth p, we
start by optimizing a depth one ansatz (single layer).
Then keeping the previous parameters ﬁxed, a new layer
is added and trained. This is followed by a simultaneous
optimization of all parameters and the process is repeated
until the desired depth p is attained.

In our implementation of this heuristic, at each opti-
mization step, the best result out of 25 random seed runs
of L-BFGS-B optimizer is chosen.

VI. CONCLUSION

QAOA is among the most studied gate based ap-
proaches for combinatorial optimization in NISQ era de-
vices. Although analytical techniques address QAOA ei-
ther at low depth or in the adiabatic limit, p → ∞, un-
derstanding performance at intermediate depths remains
largely open. Furthermore, problem density induces un-
derparameterization and limits the performance of ﬁxed
depth QAOA. An open question in this regard is the
required depth for QAOA to succeed. Additionally, by

resource, it becomes paramount in complexity studies to
know the scaling of depth with respect to problem size.
Understanding these open problems paves way towards
identifying quantum advantage in QAOA.

In this paper we introduce a methodology based on a
predictive model that aims to address these open prob-
lems. We ﬁrst relate QAOA energy approximations and
success probability (or ground state overlap) via Eq. (6).
This relation then determines success/failure of the algo-
rithm up to some (cid:15) tolerance. Based on this acceptance
criterion, we numerically recovered the critical depth
needed for QAOA to achieve success probability of at
least 0.7 for the case of MAX-2-SAT. Considering up to
15 variables and clause density up to 4 we indeed observe
that our proposed model describes the data within a 3σ
conﬁdence interval. Furthermore, we recovered for the
ﬁrst time, the scaling of critical depth with respect to
problem size which illustrates a linear trend in our con-

5

sidered range of problem sizes. Though this ﬁnite range
is insuﬃcient to assert quantum advantage, we anticipate
future works to test the accuracy of the presented model
over comprehensive ranges of densities and problem sizes.

Appendix A: Ising Embedding of SAT instances

We start by mapping logical bits {0, 1} to states {|0(cid:105) , |1(cid:105)} ∈ C2 respectively. The objective function to be minimized

is equivalent to minimizing a Hamiltonian HSAT , constructed by the real linear extension of {P0, P1, 11} as:

and

xj −→ P 0
j ,

¬xj −→ P 1
j ,

∧ −→ +,

∨ −→ ⊗.

j = |1(cid:105)(cid:104)1|j and P 0

Here P 1
clause in a given SAT instance is mapped onto projectors, P αβ···γ
2 with a penalty (cid:104)x| P αβ···γ
assignments |x(cid:105) ∈ C⊗n
The full Hamiltonian HSAT is then constructed by summing over all the clauses in an instance,

j = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0|j are rank one projectors acting on the jth qubit. The construction ensures each
k , which penalize unsatisﬁable

where Cl assigns the value of α, β, · · · , γ ∈ {0, 1}, corresponding to the negation of the literals indexed by i, j, · · · , k ∈
{1, 2, · · · , n} in the lth clause. It is straightforward to see that the ground state space of this SAT-Hamiltonian is
spanned by assignments that violate minimal number of clauses.
Decomposing the projectors onto the Z Pauli basis as,

Eq. (A3) can be re-written in the form of a generalized Ising Hamiltonian with at most k-body interaction. In case

Appendix B: Derivation of Energy-Overlap Bounds.

Once a variatinal state |ψ(θ)(cid:105) has been prepared on a quantum computer as a function of a set of tunable parameters
θ, we would like to know how close this state is to the solution space of the problem being solved. We will adapt and
extend the Lemma 1 (Variational Stability) from [10] to the degenerate case.

Let H ≥ 0 be some Hamiltonian with d–degenerate ground state energy λ0 ≥ 0. The Hamiltonian in its eigenbasis

can be expressed as,

H = λ0

d
(cid:88)

j=1

|φj(cid:105)(cid:104)φj| +

(cid:88)

k>d

λk |φk(cid:105)(cid:104)φk| .

(B1)

Here we reorder the eigenbasis so that λ0 < λ1 ≤ · · · λk · · · ≤ λmax. Consider the expectation value of the Hamiltonian
on an arbitrary state |ψ(cid:105),

(cid:104)ψ| H |ψ(cid:105) = λ0

d

(cid:88)

k>d

λk|(cid:104)φk|ψ(cid:105)|2.

(B2)

Assuming the gap ∆ = λ1 − λ0, is known,

(cid:104)ψ| H |ψ(cid:105) = λ0

d
(cid:88)

= λ0 + ∆(1 −

d
(cid:88)

|(cid:104)φj|ψ(cid:105)|2).

Rearranging the terms then gives the required lower bound on the ground state as:

d

j=1

|(cid:104)φj|ψ(cid:105)|2 ≥ 1 −

(cid:104)ψ| H |ψ(cid:105) − λ0

.

For the upper bound, we substitute for each excited state energies λk in Eq. (B2) by λ0 + λmax,

(cid:104)ψ| H |ψ(cid:105) ≤ λ0

d
(cid:88)

j=1

+ (λ0 + λmax)(1 −

d
(cid:88)

j=1

|(cid:104)φj|ψ(cid:105)|2).

Rearranging the terms now gives the required upper bound as:

d
(cid:88)

j=1

|(cid:104)φj|ψ(cid:105)|2 ≤ 1 −

(cid:104)ψ| H |ψ(cid:105) − λ0

By combining both bounds, we obtain the stability theorem that relates energy error in approximation with the

success probability (or the ground state overlap) for the degenerated case:

where f = (cid:104)ψ| H |ψ(cid:105) − λ0.
Notice that for the case of MAX-2-SAT instances, λmax ≤ m where m the number of clauses in the instance and
∆ ≥ 1.
