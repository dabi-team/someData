Abstract—We propose a generalization of the Wasserstein
distance of order 1 to the quantum states of n qudits. The
proposal recovers the Hamming distance for the vectors of the
canonical basis, and more generally the classical Wasserstein
distance for quantum states diagonal in the canonical basis. The
proposed distance is invariant with respect to permutations of the
qudits and unitary operations acting on one qudit and is additive
with respect to the tensor product. Our main result is a continuity
bound for the von Neumann entropy with respect to the proposed
distance, which signiﬁcantly strengthens the best continuity
bound with respect to the trace distance. We also propose a
generalization of the Lipschitz constant to quantum observables.
The notion of quantum Lipschitz constant allows us to compute
the proposed distance with a semideﬁnite program. We prove
a quantum version of Marton’s transportation inequality and a
quantum Gaussian concentration inequality for the spectrum of
quantum Lipschitz observables. Moreover, we derive bounds on
the contraction coefﬁcients of shallow quantum circuits and of
the tensor product of one-qudit quantum channels with respect
to the proposed distance. We discuss other possible applications
in quantum machine learning, quantum Shannon theory, and
quantum many-body systems.

n is much closer to

T HE most prominent distinguishability measures between

quantum states are the trace distance, the quantum ﬁdelity
and the quantum relative entropy, and they all have in common
the property of being unitarily invariant [1]–[3]. A fundamental
consequence of this property is that the distance between any
couple of quantum states with orthogonal supports is always
maximal. However, this property is not always desirable. For
certain applications, it is natural to use a distance with respect
1)
to which the state
n. Some desirable properties can be recovering
than to
1
the Hamming distance for vectors of the canonical basis, and
more generally robustness against local perturbations on the
input states. Such a distance may, for example, provide better
continuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy since the von
Neumann entropy is also robust against local perturbations.
In particular, any operation on one qubit can change the
entropy of a state by at most ln 4, which does not depend
on the number of qubits. Therefore, the entropy of an n-
qubit state with initial entropy O(n) remains O(n) after such
an operation. However, this continuity property cannot be
captured by any unitarily invariant distinguishability measure,
since a one-qubit operation can bring the initial state into an
orthogonal state, resulting in a maximum possible change in
the unitarily invariant measure.

B. The classical Wasserstein distances

In the setting of classical probability distributions on a met-
ric space, the distances originating from the theory of optimal
mass transport have emerged as prominent distances with the
properties above. Their exploration has led to the creation
of an extremely fruitful ﬁeld in mathematical analysis, with
applications ranging from differential geometry and partial
differential equations to machine learning [4]–[6].

Although many properties of the Wα distances do not
depend on the choice of α, in recent years the distances W1
and W2 are playing a prominent role. The W1 distance is also
called Monge–Kantorovich distance, after the foundational
works of Monge and Kantorovich [7], [8]. In particular,
Kantorovich noticed that the W1 distance is in fact induced
by a norm, and introduced the transport problem (2) as a
linear programming problem (see [9] for a detailed historical
account).

In many cases the set

is already endowed with a distance,
e.g., when dealing with subsets of Riemannian manifolds or
weighted graphs. However, one can always consider the trivial
distance

The classical W1 distance with respect to the Hamming
distance is called Ornstein’s ¯d distance and was ﬁrst considered
in [10], together with its extension to stationary stochastic pro-
cesses. It has found many applications in ergodic theory and
information theory, such as coding theorems for a large class
of discrete noisy channels with memory and rate distortion
theory [11].

Finally, there has been a surge of interest towards applica-
tions of transportation distances in machine learning in the
context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [12].
GANs [13] provide a useful algorithm to learn an unknown
probability distribution using a neural network. The learn-
ing is performed by training a generator trying to produce
samples of the unknown distribution against a discriminator
trying to distinguish the true from the generated samples.
The training process is a minimax game that converges to
a Nash equilibrium. The choice of the loss functions for the
discriminator plays a crucial role to ensure convergence in the
training procedure. Employing the Wasserstein distances as
loss function of GANs alleviates the problem of the vanishing
gradient in the training, which plagued the original version
with the Jensen–Shannon divergence (the symmetrized relative
entropy) [12]. Suitable variants of the Wasserstein distances
which further improve the efﬁciency of the training have also
been proposed [14], [15].

C. Our contribution

We propose a generalization of the W1 distance to the set
of the quantum states of n qudits. The proposed quantum
W1 distance is based on the notion of neighboring states. We
anticipate here an informal deﬁnition and refer to section III
for the details.

Deﬁnition 4 (Quantum W1 distance, informal). Two quantum
states of n qudits are neighboring if they coincide after a
suitable qudit is discarded. The quantum W1 distance is the
maximum distance that is induced by a norm that assigns
distance at most one to any couple of neighboring states.

In section IV, we prove several properties of the proposed

quantum W1 distance:

•

is invariant with respect

Its ratio with the trace distance lies between 1 and n
(subsection IV-A).
It
the
qudits and unitary operations acting on one qudit
(subsection IV-B) and additive with respect to the tensor
product (subsection IV-C). Moreover, the W1 distance be-
tween two quantum states which coincide after discarding
k qudits is at most 2k (subsection IV-D). In particular,
any quantum operation on k qudits can displace the initial
quantum state by at most 2k in the proposed distance.
It recovers the Hamming distance for vectors of the
canonical basis, and more generally the classical W1
distance for quantum states diagonal in the canonical
basis (subsection IV-E).

In section V, we deﬁne a generalization to quantum ob-
servables of the Lipschitz constant of real-valued functions on
a metric space. We prove that, as in the classical case, the
proposed quantum W1 distance between two quantum states
is equal to the maximum difference between the expectation
values of the two states with respect to an observable with
Lipschitz constant at most one. This dual formulation provides
a recipe to calculate the proposed quantum W1 distance using
a semideﬁnite program.

Our main result is a continuity bound for the von Neumann
entropy with respect to the proposed quantum W1 distance
(section VI). In the limit n
this bound implies that, if
→ ∞
two quantum states have distance o(n/ ln n), their entropies
can differ by at most o(n). The von Neumann entropy is
intimately linked to the entanglement properties of a quantum
state, and our bound implies that the entanglement of a quan-
tum state is robust against perturbations with size o(n/ ln n)
in the quantum W1 distance.

In section VII, we explore the relation between the quantum
W1 distance and the quantum relative entropy. In particular,
we prove a quantum generalization of Marton’s trasportation
inequality, stating that the square root of the relative entropy
between a generic quantum state and a product quantum state
provides an upper bound to their quantum W1 distance. In
section VIII, we apply the quantum Marton’s inequality to
prove an upper bound to the partition function of a quantum
Hamiltonian in terms of its quantum Lipschitz constant. A
fundamental consequence of this result is a quantum Gaussian
concentration inequality, stating that most of the eigenvalues

6

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY

of a quantum observable lie in a small interval whose size
depends on its Lipschitz constant.

In section IX, we study the contraction coefﬁcient with
respect to the proposed quantum W1 distance of the n-th tensor
power of a one-qudit quantum channel. While the contraction
coefﬁcient of these quantum channels with respect to the trace
, we are able to prove
distance is trivial in the limit n
an upper bound to the contraction coefﬁcient for the proposed
quantum W1 distance which does not depend on n. Moreover,
we prove that the contraction coefﬁcient of a generic n-qudit
quantum channel with respect to the proposed quantum W1
distance is upper bounded by the size of the light-cones of the
qudits.

→ ∞

We conclude in section X by discussing other possible
applications of the deﬁned quantum W1 distance in quantum
machine learning, quantum information, and quantum many-
body systems.

D. Related works

Several quantum generalizations of the Wasserstein dis-
tances have been proposed. One line of research, initiated by
Carlen, Maas, Datta and Rouz´e [16]–[22], deﬁnes a quantum
W2 distance built on the deﬁnition of a quantum differential
structure and on the equivalent dynamical formulation of the
W2 distance provided by Benamou and Brenier [23], which
assigns a length to each path of probability distributions that
connects the source with the target. The key property of this
proposal is that the resulting quantum distance is induced
by a Riemannian metric on the manifold of quantum states,
and the quantum generalization of the heat semigroup is the
gradient ﬂow of the von Neumann entropy with respect to
this metric. This quantum generalization of the W2 distance
has been shown to be intimately linked to both entropy and
Fisher information [20], and has led to determine the rate of
convergence of the quantum Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup
[17], [24]. Exploiting their quantum differential structure,
Refs. [18], [19], [22] also deﬁne a quantum generalization
of the Lipschitz constant and the W1 distance, and prove that
it satisﬁes a Talagrand inequality, which also implies some
concentration inequalities. Alternative deﬁnitions of quantum
W1 distances based on a quantum differential structure are
proposed in Refs. [25]–[28]. Refs. [29]–[31] propose quantum
W1 distances based on a distance between the vectors of the
canonical basis.

Another line of research by Golse, Mouhot, Paul and
Caglioti [32]–[37] arose in the context of the study of the
semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics and deﬁnes a quan-
tum W2 distance built on a quantum generalization of the
couplings. This distance was the key element to prove that
the mean-ﬁeld limit of quantum mechanics is uniform in the
semiclassical limit [32], and has been employed as a cost
function to train the quantum counterpart of deep generative
adversarial networks [38], [39]. Ref. [40] proposes another
quantum W2 distance based on quantum couplings, with
the property that each quantum coupling is associated to a
quantum channel. The relation between quantum couplings
and quantum channels in the framework of von Neumann

algebras has been explored in [41]. The problem of deﬁning
a quantum W1 distance through quantum couplings has been
explored in Ref. [42].

The quantum Wα distance between two quantum states can
be deﬁned as the classical Wα distance between the probability
distributions of the outcomes of an informationally complete
measurement performed on the states, which is a measurement
whose probability distribution completely determines the state.
This deﬁnition has been explored for Gaussian quantum sys-
tems with the heterodyne measurement in Refs. [43]–[45].

Notions of quantum Hamming ball of a subspace have been
deﬁned in Refs. [46], [47], who employ them to prove a Tala-
grand concentration inequality and a quantum generalization
of de Finetti’s theorem, respectively.

The Wasserstein distances have also been generalized to
other noncommutative settings, such as noncommutative ge-
ometry, where they are related to Connes’ spectral distances
[48]–[50], with applications to convergence problems of non-
commutative spaces [51]–[53]. Generalizations of the Wasser-
stein distances have been proposed in free probability, with
applications in random matrix theory [54].

times the trace norm.

The classical W1 distance is induced by a norm, and
the distance between any couple of neighboring probability
distributions on [d]n is at most one (Lemma 6 of section C).
Therefore, we look for a distance between quantum states that
is induced by a norm that assigns distance at most one to
each couple of neighboring quantum states, i.e.,
n should
be contained in the unit ball of the norm. Since the unit ball
n should be contained in the

its unit ball, and any bounded, closed, centrally symmetric

B. Symmetries

The classical W1 distance on probability distributions on
[d]n is invariant with respect to permutations of the n subsys-
tems and to permutations of the d elements of one subsystem.
The following Proposition 3 states that
the quantum W1
norm keeps all the symmetries of the classical case, and the
permutations of the d elements of one subsystem get enhanced
to unitary operations acting on one qudit.

Proposition 3 (Symmetries of the quantum W1 norm). The
quantum W1 norm is invariant with respect to permutations
of the qudits and unitary operations acting on one qudit, and
non-increasing with respect to quantum channels acting on
one qudit.

Proof. The claim follows since all the transformations above
send

n to itself.

C. Tensorization

In the following Proposition 4, we prove that the quantum
W1 distance is additive with respect to the tensor product
as its classical counterpart. This property is fundamental for
distortion measures in rate distortion theory [11, Chapter 5],
and it is not satisﬁed by the trace distance. On the other hand,
the quantum relative entropy and the logarithm of the inverse
of the quantum ﬁdelity are additive, but they are not proper
distances since they do not satisfy the triangle inequality.

This dual formulation makes the computation of the classical

for all the Wα distances).

We prove in the following that the computation of the
quantum W1 norm is also a semideﬁnite program. First, we
need to deﬁne a quantum generalization of the Lipschitz
constant:

VI. W1 CONTINUITY OF THE VON NEUMANN ENTROPY

(cid:13)

The von Neumann entropy of a quantum state [1]–[3]

S(ρ) =

−

Tr [ρ ln ρ] ,

ρ

n
∈ S

(62)

quantiﬁes the amount of uncertainty contained in the state
and plays a key role in quantum information theory. The von
Neumann entropy is not sensitive to operations performed on a
small subsystem: From Lemma 5 of section C, any operation
performed on k qudits can change the entropy of the state by
at most 2k ln d. Since already an operation performed on one
qudit can generate a quantum state orthogonal to the initial
state, this robustness of the von Neumann entropy cannot be
captured by any unitarily invariant distinguishability measure,
such as the trace distance, the quantum ﬁdelity or the quantum
relative entropy. The situation for the proposed quantum W1
distance is radically different, since it is robust with respect
to local perturbations.

In the classical case, the W1 distance provides the following

(56)

continuity bound for the Shannon entropy:

A natural question is whether the continuity bound (63)
still holds without any modiﬁcation for the quantum W1
distance. The answer is negative. Indeed, the right-hand side
of (63) has a unique maximum equal to n ln d achieved at
1) /d. Since n ln d is the entropy of the
W1(p, q) = n (d

hence the continuity bound (63) cannot hold without modiﬁ-
cations in the quantum setting.

Nonetheless, the von Neumann entropy has good continuity
properties with respect to the quantum W1 distance. Indeed,
the von Neumann entropy satisﬁes the following continuity
bound, which is equivalent to the classical bound (63) up to
a factor ln n:

Since the entropy is intimately linked with entanglement, a
fundamental consequence of this result is that the entangle-
ment properties of a quantum state are robust with respect to
perturbations in the quantum W1 distance with size o(n/ ln n).

each subsystem consisting of n qudits. Let ρAB be a pure
quantum state of AB with entanglement entropy and distillable

Theorem 2, we prove that the proposed quantum W1 distance
satisﬁes the Marton’s inequality (85):

VIII. QUANTUM GAUSSIAN CONCENTRATION INEQUALITY

A fundamental consequence of the classical Marton’s trans-
portation inequality is Talagrand’s inequality [62], which is a
Gaussian measure concentration result for Lipschitz functions.
Talgrand’s inequality states that any function that depends
smoothly on many independent random variables, but not too
much on any of them, must be essentially constant. This is a
far-reaching extension of the law of large numbers for sample
means of independent random variables, allowing for functions
whose dependence on the many variables are quite implicit and
computations may not be performed directly. As illustrated
in Refs. [63]–[65], Talagrand’s inequality is a quite general
and versatile theoretical tool, with applications ranging from
random combinatorial optimization to statistical physics and
information theory.

Our ﬁrst result in the quantum setting is the following quan-
tum Gaussian concentration inequality, which can be thought
as an upper bound to the partition function of a quantum
Hamiltonian in terms of its quantum Lipschitz constant:

In this section, we explore the contraction properties of the
quantum W1 distance. Since any quantum channel Φ is trace

A. Tensor power channels

From Proposition 3, any quantum operation acting on one
qudit cannot expand the quantum W1 distance. Therefore, for
any quantum channel Φ on Cd, the contraction coefﬁcient of
n with respect to the quantum W1 distance is at most 1:

Proposition 11 bounds the worst-case convergence to the equi-

B. Shallow quantum circuits

Quantum channels acting on multiple qudits can in gen-
eral expand the quantum W1 distance. In the following
Proposition 13, we prove that the expansion factor is bounded
by the size of the light-cones of the input qudits, which can
be easily bounded if the channel can be implemented by a
shallow local quantum circuit:

Proof. The only ﬁxed quantum state of Φp is

X. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
We have proposed a quantum generalization of the W1
distance which recovers the classical W1 distance as a special
case and keeps most of its properties, among which the con-
tinuity of the entropy. In the classical setting, the Wasserstein
distances have a huge variety of applications ranging from
mathematical analysis to machine learning and information
theory. We expect the proposed quantum W1 distance to be
a powerful tool with a broad range of applications in quan-
tum information, quantum computing and quantum machine
learning. We propose a few of them in the following.

•

•

Quantum state estimation
Estimating a quantum state of n qudits up to o(1) error
in the trace distance is a notoriously difﬁcult task, since
the number of required copies of the state grows expo-
nentially with n [68]. Requiring instead the quantum W1
distance between the true quantum state and its estimate
to be o(n) is a much weaker condition, and the number
of required copies can be much smaller. Therefore, in
all the situations where a precision guarantee in terms
of the quantum W1 distance is sufﬁcient, employing
this distance rather than the trace distance can lead
to a signiﬁcant improvement to the complexity of the
estimate.
Robustness of quantum machine learning
A fundamental desirable property of classical machine
learning algorithms is the robustness with respect to small
perturbations in the input [69], and the same property
should be desirable also when the machine learning
algorithm is quantum [70].
Quantum input: In the scenario with quantum input
data, the size of the perturbations in the input has so
far been measured with the trace distance or with the
quantum ﬁdelity [71], with respect to which any two
perfectly distinguishable quantum states are maximally
far. On the contrary, in the classical setting any two
different inputs are perfectly distinguishable, and when
the input is a bit string the size of the perturbations is
measured with the Hamming distance. Since the proposed
quantum W1 distance recovers the Hamming distance for
vectors of the canonical basis, it is a perfect candidate
to measure the size of the perturbations for quantum
algorithms for machine learning with a quantum input.
Therefore, the proposed quantum W1 distance provides a
suitable quality factor for the robustness of the quantum
algorithms for machine learning.

Classical input: In the scenario with classical input data,
choosing the right method to encode the input
into
quantum states is essential in the success of any quantum
algorithm for machine learning [70], [72]. In particular,
it is reasonable to require the encoding to be robust
with respect to small perturbations of the input. The
trivial encoding maps each bit string to the corresponding
computational basis state, and is not continuous with
respect to any unitarily invariant distance, since any bit
ﬂip on the input transforms the quantum state into an
orthogonal state. On the contrary, the trivial encoding is
continuous with respect to the proposed quantum W1
distance, since it recovers the Hamming distance for
vectors of the canonical basis. Therefore, the quantum
W1 distance provides a natural measure for the size of
the input perturbations and hence for the robustness of the
encoding, favoring encodings that map classical inputs
with small Hamming distance into quantum states with
small quantum W1 distance.
Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks
In analogy to classical GANs, quantum GANs [38]
are a paradigm for quantum machine learning where a
generator tries to produce quantum samples as close as
possible to some true quantum data, and a discriminator
tries to discriminate the generated from the true data. For
classical GANs, the Wasserstein distances have turned out
to be the best candidate for the loss function, since they
solve the problem of the vanishing gradient in the training
that plagued the GANs trained with the total variation
distance or with the Jensen–Shannon divergence [12].
For this reason, quantum Wasserstein distances have been
proposed as cost function for the quantum GANs [39],
[73]. The proposed quantum W1 distance recovers the
classical W1 distance for states diagonal in the canonical
basis and satisﬁes most of its properties, and is therefore
a good candidate for the loss function of the quantum
GANs.
Quantum rate distortion theory
Rate-distortion theory addresses the problem of determin-
ing the maximum compression rate of a signal if a certain
level of distortion in the recovered signal is allowed [11].
The measure employed to quantify the distortion plays a
fundamental role, and for a discrete alphabet the most
prominent distortion measure is the Hamming distance.
Rate-distortion theory has been extended to the quantum
setting in the iid regime [74]–[81] with a symbol-wise
entanglement ﬁdelity as distortion measure. The limita-
tion to iid arises since such symbol-wise entanglement
ﬁdelity can be deﬁned only when the quantum state
to be encoded is a tensor product of one-qudit states.
The proposed quantum W1 distance does not have this
limitation and recovers the Hamming distance for vectors
of the canonical basis, and is therefore a candidate to
extend quantum rate distortion theory beyond the iid
regime.
Quantum differential privacy
A quantum measurement is gentle if the pre- and post-
measurement states are close. Ref. [82] deﬁnes a mea-

surement of the state of n qudits to be differentially
private if the probability distributions of the outcome of
the measurement performed on any couple of neighboring
states are close, i.e., if the measurement cannot distin-
guish between any two neighboring states. For product
states, the two properties above are intimately connected:
any measurement that is gentle on product states is also
differentially private and vice versa. The proposed quan-
tum W1 distance can be thought as a generalization of the
notion of neighboring quantum states, and is therefore a
candidate to extend beyond product states the connection
between quantum differential privacy and gentleness.
Mixing time of quantum Markov semigroups
In section IX, we have determined upper bounds to the
contraction coefﬁcient of the n-th tensor power of a
one-qudit quantum channel with respect to the proposed
quantum W1 distance and we have shown that, in contrast
to the situation for the trace distance, such coefﬁcient
. It is natural
remains nontrivial in the limit n
to generalize these observations and consider the mix-
ing times of general quantum Markov semigroups with
respect to the quantum W1 distance. A nice property of
this approach, in contrast to the bounds derived using the
quantum relative entropy, is that the stationary state of
the quantum Markov process does not need to have full
rank.
Shallow quantum circuits
The Hamming distance plays a key role in the study of
the computational capabilities of quantum circuits [83],
[84]. The proposed quantum W1 distance recovers the
Hamming distance for vectors of the canonical basis and
is stable with respect to the action of local shallow quan-
tum circuits. Therefore, the proposed distance might be
useful in characterizing the states generated by constant
depth circuits, and it may be able to extend the current
results on their computational capabilities.
Quantum many-body Hamiltonians
In Proposition 10, we have proved that local quantum
Hamiltonians have a small quantum Lipschitz constant.
Therefore, the notion of quantum Lipschitz constant can
provide a generalization of the notion of local Hamilto-
nian and lead to the consequent extension of the related
properties.
