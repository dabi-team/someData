Abstract

In this paper, we address a variant of the marketing mix optimization (MMO) problem which is
commonly encountered in many industries, e.g., retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) industries.
This problem requires the spend for each marketing activity, if adjusted, be changed by a non-negligible
degree (minimum change) and also the total number of activities with spend change be limited (maximum
number of changes). With these two additional practical requirements, the original resource allocation
problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Given the size of a realistic
problem in the industrial setting, the state-of-the-art integer programming solvers may not be able to
solve the problem to optimality in a straightforward way within a reasonable amount of time. Hence,
we propose a systematic reformulation to ease the computational burden. Computational tests show
signiﬁcant improvements in the solution process.

Keywords: marketing mix optimization, optimization, semi-continuous variable, cardinality constraint,

perspective reformulation, MIQP, MISOCP.

1 Introduction

In today’s business environment, a company may employ a mix of many marketing activities (e.g., free
samples, discount coupons, weekly specials and advertisements) to attract new customers, enhance customer
loyalty, and induce sales. Given a marketing plan with a mix of marketing activities, each activity may
be allowed a spend level that results in corresponding outcome. The company often needs to adjust the
resource allocated to marketing activities due to various reasons (e.g., marketing budget change, change in
scope of targeted audience, geographies and products, product demand and/or supply changes, and activity
cost and/or performance changes), aiming to optimize the revenue, proﬁt, or other goals of the company.
In practice, the company may desire such adjustments to be planned and executed by considering resource
availability for executing changes, contractual obligations, etc. Due to minimum incremental investments
required for certain marketing activities (e.g., minimum cost of a targeted rating point in TV advertisements
or minimum cost of implementing a promotional discount), there is a need to impose a minimum change
in spend (investment) constraint for a marketing activity. Since resources will be required to implement
changes in marketing activities and resources available are limited, a constraint on the maximum to number
of activities with spend changes is also imposed. Therefore, to guarantee that the outcome of a marketing
mix optimization (MMO) is feasible for practical implementation, there is a need to solve the MMO problem
with these added constraints.

Given an existing marketing plan (typically from a previous period), our MMO problem aims to adjust
spend allocations on marketing activities with an objective of maximizing revenue subject to four sets of
constraints: bounds on activity spend, total budget limits, the minimum change in spend for an activity,
In the objective function of our
and the maximum number of activities associated with spend change.

problem, the revenue function is estimated as a (concave) separable quadratic function in terms of the
activity investments, assuming the revenue response from investments in each activity is independent of one
another. As a matter of fact, the marginal return on a marketing activity investment may not be constant,
but rather diminishing. Such a plateau curve on the return of a marketing investment can be implemented
In
using the left-half of a concave quadratic function together with an upper bound on the investment.
addition to the two constraints discussed earlier, when adjusting the spend of an activity from its baseline
(previous period) level, the company may consider other business constraints. The activity spend may be
restricted to a range to capture what is realistically implementable and to avoid a dramatic change from its
baseline level. Also, the total marketing budget proposed may be limited based on the company’s ﬁnancial
plan.

An intuitive way to formulate such a resource allocation problem is to set activity spend/investments as
decision variables. By incorporating only constraints on activity spend bounds and total budget limits, the
optimization problem becomes a quadratic programming (QP) with an objective function that maximizes
the (concave) separable quadratic revenue function. It is well known that if the Q matrix of a QP is positive
semi-deﬁnite, the problem can be solved in (weakly) polynomial time using the ellipsoid method [16]. A
commercial QP solver (e.g., Gurobi [13]) can solve the problem quite eﬃciently. However, once we incorporate
the minimum change in spend and maximum number of changes constraints mentioned above, we may need
to introduce binary variables to take care of the discrete nature of the decision variables. Hence, the
optimization problem becomes a mixed integer nonlinear program, which is well known to be NP-hard and
generally cannot be guaranteed to solve in polynomial time.

In this study, we propose to employ a semi-continuous variable to represent a certain type of semi-
continuity of an activity spend level and utilize its property to facilitate the solution process. A semi-
continuous variable is deﬁned as a variable whose value is either 0 or in an interval between a lower bound
and an upper bound [23, 22], where 0 can be within the bound range. To align our activity spend level
with the standard deﬁnition of the semi-continuous variable, we choose to use change in spend for an
activity from the baseline level as the decision variable. The change in spend (adjustment) then becomes
a semi-continuous variable. However, the minimum change requirement further splits the one continuous
range into (at most) two disconnected continuous ranges. We present a systematic way to formulate the
minimum change requirement by exploiting the semi-continuous nature of the variable. The constraint for
the maximum number of changes in our problem is known as a cardinality constraint in the literature.

Optimization problems with semi-continuous variables and cardinality constraint have received much
attention in the literature as there exists many applications in the real world, e.g., portfolio selection, and
compressed sensing and subset selection [22]. In particular, there exists quite a few papers discussing how to
solve a variety of portfolio selection problems. Such problems may include minimizing the risk of a portfolio,
represented by a positive semi-deﬁnite quadratic function, subject to a typical minimum gain constraint
and several other linear constraints, resulting in a mixed integer quadratic program (MIQP). Our MMO
problem with minimum change in spend and maximum number of changes shares a similar model structure
with the portfolio selection problems, especially those with the minimum buy-in requirement. Inspired by
the perspective reformulation Frangioni and Gentile [8, 10] used to solve optimization problems with semi-
continuous variables, where an MIQP is reformulated as a mixed integer second-order cone program, this
paper proposes an alternative formulation for our MMO problem to ease the computational burden. The
model formulation and research ﬁndings in this paper can be readily applied to problems with similar model
structure and constraint settings.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews literature on optimization models in
marketing planning and optimization models with semi-continuous variables and cardinality constraint, with
a focus on portfolio selection problems. Section 3 presents a systematic way to model semi-continuity on
variables required to have a minimum change and proposes an alternative to model our MMO problem.
Section 4 reports on computational tests comparing the solution outcomes of various formulations. Section 5
analyzes the computational results and discusses the pros and cons of the varying formulations. Finally,
Section 6 concludes with highlights on the ﬁndings of this research.

2 Literature Review

Optimization methods and tools are valuable in providing signiﬁcant performance improvement in the mar-
keting eﬀorts of today’s business. Fischer et al. [7], for example, constructed a dynamic optimization model
to allocate marketing budget across countries, products and marketing activities, and proposed a heuristic
to obtain a feasible solution that is close to optimal. They implemented it at Bayer, a large multi-national
pharmaceutical and chemical ﬁrm, and estimated the proﬁt improvement potential to be more than 50%
which is worth hundreds of millions of euros. In general, a decision support system for marketing consists
of two stages: estimating the response of related variables and optimizing the performance over some of
the variables. Such a system has been discussed extensively in the literature. For example, Balachandran
and Gensch [2] estimated sales as a function of the marketing mix and environmental variables and for-
mulated the budget allocation problem as a geometric programming problem. More recently, Pferschy et
al. [20] estimated the direct and joint eﬀects of diﬀerent media in a promotional campaign and formulated
the advertising media selection problem as a quadratic knapsack model. The quality of results from an
optimization model is dependent on the response model. Albers [1] argued that the output of the response
model should be optimizable, and provided recommendations on optimizable and implementable aggregate
response modeling for marketing decision support. For an overview of optimization methods in marketing,
Mantrala and Kanuri [17] conducted a survey over the last 70 years of research, where they summarized each
example with the decision variables, the constraints, the sales response function and the objective function.
Our MMO problem, however, is unique to what exists in the marketing literature but is closely related
to portfolio selection problem with the minimum buy-in threshold and limited total number of assets, which
belongs to the family of mathematical programs with semi-continuous variables and cardinality constraint.
Hence, we provide a literature review on the techniques used to solve mathematical programs with semi-
continuous variables, especially in the context of perspective reformulation. Portfolio selection problems
(especially a variety of Markowitz’s mean-variance (MV) portfolio selection models) have received much at-
tention in the ﬁeld of ﬁnance and ﬁnancial engineering. One popular mean-variance model is to minimize the
volatility of portfolio returns (risk) subject to a guaranteed return, full capital invested and non-negative in-
vestment [18], the model is usually formulated as an MIQP. In addition to this basic model, many researchers
have been adding more real-life constraints and proposing eﬃcient ways to solve these more practical mod-
els. For example, Bienstock [4] presented a computational experience with a branch-and-cut algorithm to
solve the MV model with a cardinality constraint. Bertsimas and Shioda [3] described a branch-and-bound
based algorithm with the use of Lemke’s method to solve the MV model with the minimum buy-in threshold
and cardinality constraint. Cesarone et al. [6] studied the MV model with the minimum buy-in threshold
and cardinality constraint, and two other variations. Instead of minimizing the volatility of return, one of
their variations minimizes conditional value-at-risk and the other minimizes mean absolute deviation. They
proposed an approach based on a reformulation as a standard QP and presented some theoretical results to
solve the MV with minimum buy-in threshold and cardinality constraint.

One of the eﬀective techniques to solve a mixed integer convex nonlinear programming problem with
semi-continuous variables and a separable objective function is via the perspective relaxation proposed by
Frangioni and Gentile [8]. They constructed a convex envelope of the univariate function over a semi-
continuous variable by using its perspective function. By exploiting the characterization of the perspective
function, they derived a family of valid inequalities (referred to as perspective cuts, P/C) and incorporated
them into a typical branch-and-bound algorithm, resulting in substantial performance improvement in solving
a unit commitment problem. In addition to P/C reformulation, one can also reformulate the whole problem as
a second-order cone program (SOCP) if the problem has a separable quadratic objective function. Frangioni
and Gentile [10] conducted a computational comparison of P/C versus SOCP reformulations on portfolio
selection and unit commitment problems. They concluded that P/C reformulation seems to perform better
due to much more eﬃcient re-optimization capabilities of branch-and-bound algorithms compared to interior
point algorithms at that time. Frangioni and Gentile [9] extended the use of perspective relaxation to
problems with non-separable quadratic objective functions. They proposed two methods to decompose
the one positive semi-deﬁnite Q matrix into two positive semi-deﬁnite matrices, one generic and the other
diagonal. One method is more eﬃcient involving the calculation of the minimum eigenvalue and the other
is more costly requiring the solution of a semi-deﬁnite program. Based on testing both methods using P/C
reformulation on an MV model, they concluded that the more costly method signiﬁcantly outperforms the

3

other. Zheng et al. [24] later proposed to decompose the Q matrix by solving a new semi-deﬁnite program
claiming that their decomposition gives the tightest continuous relaxation of the perspective reformulation
of quadratic programming problems with minimum threshold and cardinality constraints.

There are many real world applications for the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems
with semi-continuous variables in addition to portfolio selection and unit commitment problems. Gunluk and
Linderoth [12] discussed a variety of practical MINLP problems whose relaxation can be strengthened via
the perspective reformulation, including separable quadratic uncapacitated facility location problem, network
design problems with congestion constraints, scheduling problems with controllable processing times, unit
commitment problems, stochastic service system design problems, and portfolio selection problems. Sun et
al. [22] surveyed developments in solving MINLP application problems with semi-continuous variables and
cardinality constraint, including problems in production planning, portfolio selection, compressed sensing,
and subset selection in regression.

While the research in MINLP applications is quite extensive, all the applications considered semi-
continuous variables to be either 0 or within a continuous range (i.e., x ∈ {0} ∪ [α, β]). However, in our
MMO problem, the change (either positive or negative) in an activity spend also requires to be at least no
less than a certain threshold (i.e., x ∈ {0} ∪ [α, β] : |x| ≥ δ). Using an analogy to portfolio selection problem,
we could allow either long selling or short selling a security with minimum buy-in threshold. We can put
an absolute value operator to the semi-continuous variable to satisfy such a requirement. However, this will
result in a nonlinear constraint to the semi-continuous variable. In this paper, we extend the perspective
relaxation to the semi-continuous variable with the absolute value operator.

3 Optimization Problem and Proposed Models

To reiterate, our MMO problem is to maximize revenue subject to four groups of constraints: (a) bounds on
activity spend, requiring the activity spend to be within a certain range; (b) total budget limit, requiring the
total of all activity spends to be within a baseline budget; (c) minimum change in activity spend, desiring
the change in activity spend (if any) to be at least a certain amount (see below); and, (d) maximum number
of activities with spend change, limiting the required actions from a baseline plan. The decisions are which
activities to change investments and by how much for each activity. In practice, there may be other linear
constraints based on certain business requirements, which can be added to the model without suppressing
the beneﬁt of the following proposed reformulation. Without loss of generality, we consider only the four
groups of constraints to keep the model succinct. In constructing the optimization model, instead of activity
spend, we use the change in activity spend as the decision variable to facilitate later model reformulation.
For the objective function, we assume that the revenue is a (concave) separable quadratic function of spend
change. Furthermore, we assume that the coeﬃcients of the second-order terms are non-positive so that the
optimization problem is indeed a concave maximization problem.

By incorporating the minimum change in activity spend and the maximum number of activities with spend
change constraints, we ﬁrst formulate the MMO problem as an MINLP. We further present a systematic
way to model the semi-continuity due to the minimum change requirement. With the (concave) separable
quadratic revenue function and the pre-processing of the minimum change constraint and activity spend
bounds, we can reformulate the problem as an MIQP. However, solving the MIQP to optimality directly
using standard commercial solvers may be time-consuming and impractical. We then propose an alternative
model of the optimization problem as a mixed integer second-order cone program (MISOCP), aiming to
shrink the optimality gap and/or reduce the solution time. In the next several subsections, we ﬁrst elaborate
on the modeling of the semi-continuity and then explain the reformulation of the optimization problem in
detail.

3.1 The Minimum Change in Activity Spend

When the spend on activity i, yi, changes from its baseline level si, the activity spend range [li, ui] and
minimum change requirement |yi − si| ≥ δi are imposed on the spend change xi. We assume the baseline
level is within the activity spend range and therefore 0 is feasible for the spend change.

The introduction of the minimum change constraint causes the feasible spend change xi to become
discontinuous. Without such a requirement, the change can be any point within the range [li − si, ui − si].

4

With the minimum change requirement, there are at most three possible regions that the spend change may
fall into: region L, decrease in spend; region S, no change; and, region R, increase in spend, as shown in
Figure 1. Note that regions L and R may or may not exist (feasible or infeasible), depending on the relative
positions of the baseline level si to the activity spend range [li, ui], and the minimum change (δi).

Figure 1: Illustration of the spend change of activity i, xi, bounded by its activity spend baseline level si
and spend range [li, ui], the minimum change δi, and the resultant feasible regions L, S and R, shown by
red segments.

Figure 1 illustrates the scenario with the most (three) possible feasible regions for the spend change of
activity i. The bounds of regions L and R may vary under diﬀerent scenarios. Taking region L as an example,
if the activity spend lower bound minus the baseline level is no larger than the negative minimum change
(i.e., li − si ≤ −δi), the lower bound of region L, lL
i , is the activity spend lower bound minus the baseline
level, and its upper bound uL
i ] = [li − si, −δi]). On the other
i
hand, if the activity spend lower bound minus the baseline level is larger than the negative minimum change,
region L does not exist. Similar relationships can be derived for region R. For region S, since we assume
the baseline level is within the activity spend bound (i.e., li ≤ si ≤ ui), the bound of region S always exists
and is 0. Based on these three regions, we introduce two binary variables (zL
i , where the superscription
denotes the region) to indicate which region that the optimal spend change falls into. Table 1 discloses all
possible relationships between region bounds and binary variable values for the three regions under diﬀerent
scenarios.

In the above formulation, constraint (3.1a) speciﬁes the lower bound and upper bound of the spend change.
Constraint (3.1b) ensures the spend change falls into one and only one of the three regions. Moreover,
constraint (3.1c) requires the indicator variables be binary. Note that we specify the possible values of the
two binary variables in BL

i according to Table 1.

i and BR

An alternative to the above formulation may use a constraint that restricts the absolute value of the
spend change to be no less than the minimum change if the activity spend does not stay at the baseline
level. However, it will result in an MINLP due to the use of absolute value operator, which we will discuss
in the next subsection.

3.2 The Convex Envelope of a Univariate Function Over a Semi-continuous

Variable with Absolute Value Operator

Frangioni and Gentile [8] constructed a convex envelope of the univariate function over a semi-continuous
variable and proposed to use it as a building block to reformulate their original problem involving semi-
continuous variables, attempting to obtain a tighter continuous relaxation. They considered the feasible
value of a semi-continuous variable as either 0 or within a continuous range. In this paper, we extend their
approach to a semi-continuous variable with the absolute value operator, i.e., a variable is either 0 or within
multiple continuous ranges.

Considering the minimization problem in [22], we add the absolute value operator to the semi-continuous

variable in the disjunctive constraint and use a slightly diﬀerent notation as follows:

min
x,t

f (x) + dt

s.t. αt ≤ |x| ≤ βt

t ∈ {0, 1}

(3.2a)

(3.2b)

(3.2c)

In the model, x is the semi-continuous variable whose value is either 0 or a point within [α, β] or [−β, −α],
and t is the indicator variable whose value is 1 if x is nonzero and 0 otherwise. The objective function
consists of two parts, one is a continuous function of x and the other is a ﬂat cost d if x is nonzero.

Without the absolute value operator, the perspective reformulation approach for the minimization prob-
lem proposed by Frangioni and Gentile [8] is to replace the continuous part of the objective function
with its perspective function (i.e., f (x) → tf (x/t)). By adding the absolute value operator, the feasible
value of the semi-continuous variable changes from x ∈ {0} ∪ [lR, uR] ({0} plus a continuous range) to
x ∈ {0} ∪ [lL, uL] ∪ [lR, uR] ({0} plus two continuous ranges), where [lL, uL] and [lR, uR] represent [−β, −α]
and [α, β], respectively, for the rest of the subsection. To remove the absolute value operator, we introduce
an additional binary variable t and rewrite the problem as follows:

min
x,t

s.t.

f (x) + dt

(cid:2)lL (cid:0)1 − t(cid:1) + lRt(cid:3) t ≤ x ≤ (cid:2)uL (cid:0)1 − t(cid:1) + uRt(cid:3) t
t ≤ t

t, t ∈ {0, 1}

(3.3a)

(3.3b)

(3.3c)

(3.3d)

In the above formulation, constraint (3.3c) tightens the feasible region by excluding the point (cid:0)t, t(cid:1) = (0, 1),
which makes x = 0 same as (cid:0)t, t(cid:1) = (0, 0) does. Given t = 1 in constraint (3.3b), the feasible range of x
changes from [lL, uL] to [lR, uR] as t goes from 0 to 1. By specifying the value of t, the two square brackets
become speciﬁc lower and upper bounds for x and the problem reduces to the minimization problem in [22],
where its objective function can be rewritten using its perspective function to provide a tighter continuous

6

relaxation. Note that, in general, the two continuous ranges need not be symmetric with respect to 0 (and
can even overlap) although we derived it by removing the absolute value operator from the semi-continuous
variable.

We now develop a tighter formulation for the nonlinear constraint (3.3b) by employing a similar technique
as in [22]. Considering the lower bound of x in the constraint, the feasible points (cid:0)t, t, x(cid:1) are (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, lL),
and (1, 1, lR). Any point in the smallest triangular area formed by these three points can be represented as:
(1 − θ) (0, 0, 0) + θ (cid:0)1, ˜t, ˜x(cid:1) = (cid:0)θ, θ˜t, θ˜x(cid:1) ,

where θ ∈ [0, 1], ˜t ∈ [0, 1], and ˜x = lL (cid:0)1 − ˜t(cid:1) + lR˜t. Letting t = θ and t = θ˜t = t˜t, we have ˜t = t
lL (cid:16)
0 ≤ t
bound of x can be represented as:

t and
= lL (cid:0)t − t(cid:1) + lRt. Hence, the lower

t ≤ 1 (or 0 ≤ t ≤ t). Then, we have θ˜x = t

+ lR (cid:16) t

t

(cid:17)

(cid:104)

lL(t − t) + lRt ≤ x
t, t ∈ [0, 1].

By applying a similar logic to the upper bound of x, problem (3.3) can then be equivalently rewritten as
follows.

min

s.t.

f (x) + dt

lL (cid:0)t − t(cid:1) + lRt ≤ x ≤ uL (cid:0)t − t(cid:1) + uRt
t ≤ t

t, t ∈ {0, 1}

(3.4a)

(3.4b)

(3.4c)

(3.4d)

In other words, constraint (3.3b) is linearized by removing the multiplier t outside the brackets and also
replacing 1 with t inside the brackets, which provides the convex hull of the nonlinear constraint. Moreover,
we can perform variable transformation to replace (cid:0)t − t(cid:1) and t with zL and zR, and rewrite problem (3.4)
as follows.

min
x,t

s.t.

f (x) + dt

lLzL + lRzR ≤ x ≤ uLzL + uRzR
zL + zR ≤ 1
zL + zR = t
zL, zR ∈ {0, 1}

(3.5a)

(3.5b)

(3.5c)

(3.5d)

(3.5e)

The above transformation enables the values of zL and zR directly indicate which region x is in ([lL, uL],
[lR, uR], or {0}), so we can use it to impose region-related constraints for our MMO problem. Then, we are
able to replace the continuous part of the objective function with its perspective function to obtain a tighter
continuous relaxation as follows since problems (3.3) and (3.5) are equivalent.

min
x,t

s.t.

(cid:17)

(cid:16) x

lLzL + lRzR ≤ x ≤ uLzL + uRzR
zL + zR ≤ 1
zL + zR = t
zL, zR ∈ {0, 1}

(3.6a)

(3.6b)

(3.6c)

(3.6d)

(3.6e)

Furthermore, we extend the above derivation from {0} plus two continuous ranges to {0} plus any number
of continuous ranges (say n ranges) by replacing (3.6b) to (3.6e) with the following constraints.

l1z1 + l2z2 + · · · + lnzn ≤ x ≤ u1z1 + u2z2 + · · · + unzn
z1 + z2 + · · · + zn ≤ 1
z1 + z2 + · · · + zn = t
z1, z2, . . . , zn ∈ {0, 1}

7

We thereby use formulation (3.6) as a building block to formulate the MMO problem, aiming for a tighter
continuous relaxation to accelerate the solution process.

3.3 Optimization Models

To formulate our marketing resource allocation problem with the minimum spend change and maxi-

In the above formulation, objective function (3.7a) maximizes the total revenue generated from marketing
activities. Constraint (3.7b) ensures the spend is within the bounds for each activity; constraint (3.7c)

8

assures the total spend is within the upper bound of total budget; constraint (3.7d) stipulates the minimum
change in spend; constraint (3.7e) guarantees the maximum number of changes; and, ﬁnally, constraint (3.7f)
deﬁnes the integrality of decision variables.

The absolute value operator in constraint (3.7d) breaks the continuous range of [li − si, ui − si] for xi
into at most two separate ranges and one point. To handle such discontinuity, we introduce two more
binary variables and pre-calculate the bounds of the separate ranges to remove the absolute value operator
from the constraint. Consequently, we reformulate the optimization problem as a mixed integer quadratic
programming as follows.

Compared to the MINLP, constraints (3.7b), (3.7d)-(3.7f) are replaced by constraints (3.8c)-(3.8f) in the

An alternative to handling the requirement of minimum change in spend (other than explicitly considering
all possible feasible regions for an activity spend) is to directly restrict the square of the spend change

that our objective function is a (concave) separable quadratic function, we further reformulate the model
as a mixed integer second-order cone program. Considering the (concave) separable quadratic function, we

4 Numerical Experiment and Real-World Application

We conduct a series of computational tests, including a set of numerical instances and a real-world application,
to compare the solution process of the MIQP and MISOCP formulations using Gurobi solver.

4.1 Numerical Instances

Although there are several existing libraries of quadratic programming instances (e.g., [19, 11]) available, the
structures of such instances are diﬀerent from the one discussed in this paper. Hence, we construct instances
that are more consistent with our model (3.8). Speciﬁcally, we limit the total activity budget to be no more
than 1% away from the total baseline activity budget (i.e., ρ = 1.01), add two more linear constraints to the
model (i.e., (cid:80)
i∈I γisi), and restrict the spend change
for each activity to be no less than (cid:15) times the current spend (i.e., δi = (cid:15)si).

i∈I γixi ≥ (η − 1) (cid:80)

i∈I τixi ≤ (ζ − 1) (cid:80)

i∈I τisi and (cid:80)

In order to generate instances at diﬀerent diﬃculty levels, we employ the method used in [21], which
investigated the hard instances of the Knapsack Problem (KP), to generate three sets of objective function
coeﬃcients based on the two added linear constraints: (i) uncorrelated, (ii) weakly correlated, and (iii)
strongly correlated. We imitate these two constraints as two knapsack constraints in spite of that the
other decision (i.e., change amount) also needs to be made if an activity is chosen for spend change. The
relationship between the objective function coeﬃcients (θi, φi and ψi) and constraint coeﬃcients (τi and γi)
of these three sets are as suggested per [21] as follows.

• (i) Uncorrelated : θi is uniformly distributed in [−10, −1], and each of φi and ψi is uniformly distributed
in [1, 10]. There is no correlation between the objective function coeﬃcients (θi, φi, ψi) and the con-
straint coeﬃcients (τi, γi). Such instances are supposedly relatively easy to solve from the perspective
of KP since its ratio of proﬁt to weight has quite a wide variation.

• (ii) Weakly correlated : given τi and γi, θi is uniformly distributed in (cid:2)− (cid:0) τi+γi

2 − 1(cid:1)(cid:3)
and each of φi and ψi is distributed in (cid:2)(cid:0) τi+γi
2 + 1(cid:1)(cid:3). There is a strong correlation between
2 − 1(cid:1) , (cid:0) τi+γi
each of the objective function coeﬃcients θi, φi and ψi and the constraint coeﬃcients τi and γi. Such
instances are supposedly harder to solve since its ratio of proﬁt to weight has much smaller variation.
2 + 1(cid:1) and each of φi and ψi is
computed as (cid:0) τi+γi
2 + 1(cid:1). Each of the objective function coeﬃcients θi, φi and ψi is a function of the
constraint coeﬃcients τi and γi. Such instances are supposedly the hardest among the three sets to
solve since its ratio of proﬁt to weight has no variation.

• (iii) Strongly correlated : given τi and γi, θi is computed as − (cid:0) τi+γi

2 + 1(cid:1) , − (cid:0) τi+γi

10

The steps to generate data for the numerical instances are: (1) randomly choose li and ui from uniform
distribution of [1, 5] and [5, 10], respectively; (2) randomly choose si from a uniform distribution of [li, ui];
(3) randomly choose τi from a uniform distribution of [1, 10], same as to γi; (4) generate the three sets of
uncorrelated/correlated θi, φi and ψi using τi and γi accordingly; (5) randomly choose ζ and η from uniform
i and uR
distribution of [0.90, 1.00] and [1.00, 1.10], respectively; (6) set ρ = 1.01; and, (7) compute lL
i
using si and δi according to Table 1. All the generated random variates are rounded to two decimal places.
In addition to the three sets of uncorrelated/correlated objective function coeﬃcients, we parameterize
the total number of activities (n = {500, 750, 1000}), the minimum change in spend (in percentage of current
spend, i.e., (cid:15) = {5%, 10%, 20%}, δi = (cid:15)si), and the maximum number of changes (in percentage of total
activities, i.e., ξ = {50%, 75%, 100%}, m = ξn). For each combination of correlation, n, (cid:15), and ξ, we generate
35 instances, resulting in 2,835 instances in total. The instances are solved using Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) (running Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03 with dual Intel(R) Xeon(R) 16-core E5-2686 v4 CPU @
2.3GHz and 244GB memory) with Gurobi version 7.0.2. Moreover, we set the following Gurobi conﬁguration:
the maximum run time is set to 100 seconds, the acceptable optimality gap is set to 0, the computing thread
is set to 4, and other parameters are at their default values. For performance comparison between the MIQP
and MISOCP formulations, we report the median of optimality gap, ratio of Gurobi run time and ratio of
number of nodes from the branch-and-bound scheme employed by Gurobi. We chose median over mean to
avoid the disproportionate inﬂuence of outliers.

4.2 Numerical Results

We report the numerical experiment results in Tables 2 as follows, which shows the problem characteristics
for the MIQP and MISOCP formulations grouped by all, the correlation, the total number of activities (n),
the minimum change in activity spend in percentage of the current spend ((cid:15)), and the maximum number of
spend changes in percentage of the total activities (ξ).

Out of the 2,835 instances, 1,995 (or 70%) of the MISOCP can be solved to optimality within 100 seconds,
compared to 37 (or 1%) of the MIQP. Furthermore, the median optimality gap for the MIQP overall is 4.08%.
The gap tends to grow with the increase of correlation, n and (cid:15), and the decrease of ξ, among which the
gap varies most (from 10.03% to 1.70%) with the change in ξ (from 50% to 100%). In addition, in general
the MISOCP spends 91% less time and requires 99% fewer nodes than the MIQP to obtain a solution with
a much smaller optimality gap. In particular, the MISOCP spends 89% less time and requires 98% fewer
nodes than the MIQP when ξ = 50%, which represents the hardest instances (with the largest optimality
gap of 10.03%) in our experiment. Note that the run time, optimality gap and node count together may
better reﬂect the diﬃculty of the instances than any one of them alone.

4.3 A Real-World Application

We discuss our experience of applying the MISOCP method to an instance of adjusting the marketing plan
at one of the largest independent food retailers in the United States. The company employs marketing
instruments that can be categorized into ten diﬀerent groups, speciﬁed as TV ads, direct mail, check-out
coupon, digital media, digital coupon, ﬂyer, outdoor ads, radio ads, paper coupon, and in-store displays.
Among these groups, some are further divided into several subgroups, each reﬂecting an advertising campaign
targeted at a local market. For example, a TV ad in a back-to-school campaign targeting a speciﬁc city
station is considered as part of a subgroup. There are close to 200 marketing instrument groups/subgroups
considered, and each of them may produce a sales lift on certain products or product categories in certain
store groups for some time periods. The numbers of involved store groups and product categories are both
in the hundreds.

A speciﬁc marketing instrument subgroup on a group of stores in a speciﬁc week is considered a marketing
activity, and the resources (marketing spend) allocated to speciﬁc marketing activities constitute decisions
to be made in a marketing mix optimization based planning process. The product category sales lifts by
marketing instrument, store group, and week combinations are given by separable quadratic functions that
are estimated based on historical data. The objective for the marketing mix optimization is to maximize the
total estimated sales by optimally allocating the total marketing budget to marketing activities, subject to
certain business rules. Typical business rules include but are not limited to: (1) lower and upper bounds on

Table 2: Performance comparison of the MIQP and MISOCP formulations for the numerical experiment.
We group the result by all, correlation, total number of activities (n), minimum change in activity spend (in
percentage of current spend, i.e., δi = (cid:15)si) and maximum number of spend changes (in percentage of total
activities, i.e., m = ξn), and report the median to avoid outlier inﬂuence. Both run time and node count
ratios use MIQP result as the base, e.g., overall the MISOCP spends 91% less time and requires 99% fewer
nodes than the MIQP.

the spend of each marketing activity for each week; (2) lower and upper bounds on the total spend of each
pair of marketing instrument-store groups for a part or the entire planning horizon; (3) lower and upper
bounds on the total spend of a speciﬁc combination of marketing activities (e.g., total TV spend including
all TV subgroups across all weeks, total TV and radio spends across all weeks, etc.); and (4) lower and
upper bounds on the total spend of all marketing activities. The baseline marketing mix optimization model
involves about 3,000 valid marketing activities (decision variables) and 2,600 business rules (constraints).

After the baseline marketing mix optimization problem is solved as a part of the company’s annual
planning process, an adjustment of the spend on each marketing activity is then contemplated as part of
periodic marketing plan reviews. In one scenario of this adjustment optimization, we allow the maximum
number of activities with spend change to be 25% of the total marketing activities, set the minimum change
in each spend to be 10% of its baseline spend, and limit the total budget to be 90% of its baseline level. In
addition, we relax the budgets of collective marketing activity spends stipulated in other business rules to
be from 80% to 120% of their baseline levels. The adjustment optimization problem aims to maximize the
total estimated sales subject to the new spend adjustment requirements.

We apply both MIQP and MISOCP formulations to solve the aforementioned adjustment optimization
problem. Compared to our baseline planning model, which consists of nearly 3,000 decision variables and
2,600 constraints, the spend adjustment model adds additional binary decision variables (about 6,000 to the
MIQP and 9,000 to MISOCP) and constraints (about 12,000 to the MIQP and 18,000 to MISOCP) to enforce
the requirements of minimum change in spend and maximum number of changes. By using Gurobi on the
same computer mentioned in Section 4.1, with the same conﬁguration except for extending the maximum
run time to 600 seconds, we obtain the results in Table 3.

In this real-world application, the MIQP provides a good heuristic solution, which is almost as good
as the true optimal solution, in a little more of ten seconds and spends the rest of the time shrinking
the optimality gap to 0.0120%. On the other hand, the MISOCP obtains the optimal solution within two

seconds without even exploring the branch-and-bound tree. With the rapid computation time resulting
from the use of MISOCP, we were able to produce a Pareto curve of the revenue (in percentage of maximum
revenue, which is obtained by allowing all marketing activities subject to spend change) against the maximum
number of activities allowed to change (in percentage of total activities). We illustrate such a Pareto curve
in Figure 2. The curve provides insights regarding the number of spend adjustment versus its revenue
gain. For example, it clearly shows that the spend adjustment of 25% of total activities is around its knee
point, translating into 99.5% of maximum revenue. Management can utilize the Pareto curve to explore
the tradeoﬀs between the activity adjustments and revenue opportunities by further considering available
resources, costs of adjustment and desired beneﬁts. In addition to swiftly analyzing various scenarios, the
MISOCP also enables us to expand our marketing mix adjustment optimization problem at a more granular
level, indicating more achievable beneﬁts in practice.

5 Discussion

The outcomes from our numerical experiment show that the MISOCP formulation signiﬁcantly outperforms
the MIQP formulation from the perspective of optimality gap, run time and node count. For the majority
of the instances of various problem sizes and diﬃculty levels we tested, the MISOCP formulation can be
solved to optimality in tens of seconds while the MIQP formulation only resulted in near-optimal solutions
with a much longer running time. Given the maximum run time of 100 seconds, for very few instances (less

13

than 5.5% of total) the MIQP do outperform the MISOCP, by either providing a smaller optimality gap or
spending less solution time. Although for these instances the MIQP branch-and-bound tree sizes were much
larger than the corresponding MISOCP one, the MIQP formulation was solved utilizing re-optimization
capabilities of the branch-and-bound algorithm to shorten the overall solution time.

In general, the MISOCP formulation provides a much tighter continuous relaxation compared to the
MIQP formulation at the expense of a slightly larger problem size (i.e., more decision variables and con-
straints). Due to the tighter continuous relaxation, the MISOCP formulation requires much smaller brand-
and-bound tree sizes to reach a given optimality gap. If we specify an acceptable optimality gap of 5%, in
addition to the allowed run time of 100 seconds in the numerical experiment, the MISOCP has, in median,
a 66% smaller actual optimality gap, a 83% shorter run time, and a 100% smaller resultant tree size as com-
pared to the MIQP formulation. Moreover, the MIQP formulation ﬁnds a heuristic solution of a single-digit
optimality gap quite fast but has much diﬃculty in further reducing the gap. If we specify diﬀerent allowed
run times in the numerical experiment, the MIQP reaches a median optimality gap of 5.49% in 10 seconds,
4.43% in 50 seconds and 4.08% in 100 seconds. For many instances, it would take the MIQP hours, if not
days, to reach an optimality gap of 1%. In fact, the MIQP swiftly provides a heuristic solution which is in
proximity of the optimal, sometimes even the optimal itself, with a noticeable optimality gap, and spends
the rest of the time proving the solution quality.

When using Gurobi with default conﬁguration to solve the problem in both formulations, even though
the MIQP formulation had the advantage of re-optimization capabilities of the branch-and-bound algorithm,
the MISOCP formulation still resulted in better performance. In addition to a much smaller tree size, the
outstanding performance of the MISOCP is also attributed to an eﬃcient algorithm Gurobi employed using
a linearized, outer approximation approach [14], which may re-use information from previously solved nodes
in its branch-and-bound tree. If we solve a continuous quadratic constraint programming (QCP) at each
node (by conﬁguring Gurobi appropriately) when solving the MISOCP [15], then the solution time would
be much longer (even longer than the MIQP).

The computing speed gained with the MISOCP formulation directly translates into practical implications
as evidenced by the real-world application in Section 4.3. While the business rule on the maximum number
of changes may be dictated by available resources, contractual obligations and other factors, using the Pareto
between revenue improvements and number of activities with marketing spend change, we are able to provide
management with a data-driven approach to determine the maximum number of activities to allow for spend
changes. In fact, with some ﬂexibility and information on costs of implementing marketing spend changes,
we should be able to recommend an optimal number of activities with marketing spend change that will
generate the best marketing returns.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we address an important variant of the marketing mix optimization problem that adjusts budget
allocations for a large number of marketing activities. For practical reasons, the optimization problem needs
to consider the minimum change in activity spend as well as the maximum number of activities with spend
change. We provide a systematic way to model the minimum change requirement. Moreover, we develop
a method to apply perspective reformulation on a semi-continuous variable with absolute value operator,
and further on a variable with several separate continuous ranges as its feasible regions. This method aims
to obtain a tighter continuous relaxation. By using this relaxation technique and exploiting the special
property of the (concave) separable quadratic objective function, we reformulate the original optimization
problem as a mixed integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) to accelerate the speed of solution
process. Based on the computational tests involving numerous specially designed instances and the real-world
application, the proposed reformulation improves signiﬁcantly by requiring less computation times and/or
providing better solutions. The improvement can be attributed to the smaller branch-and-bound tree and
much eﬃcient Gurobi algorithm for MISOCP. The technique and reformulation discussed in this paper can
be readily applied to other problems involving semi-continuous variables with absolute value operators and
cardinality constraint, e.g., a mean-variance portfolio selection problem which allows both long selling and
short selling with minimum buy-in threshold.

Our future research work will extend our approach to similar problems with non-separable quadratic

14

objective functions. Note that, in some cases, the spend of a marketing activity may have a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the performance of other activities, resulting in a non-separable quadratic objective function.
Some researchers have proposed several methods to decompose a non-separable Q matrix into two matrices
(generic and diagonal) so that the perspective reformulation can be applied to semi-continuous variables for
a tighter continuous relaxation. Our approach may be combined with the matrix decomposition methods
to improve the solution process for problems with non-separable objective functions. This may provide a
promising research direction to explore in the future.
