ABSTRACT
To approach diﬀerent business objectives, online traﬃc shaping al-
gorithms aim at improving exposures of a target set of items, such
as boosting the growth of new commodities. Generally, these al-
gorithms assume that the utility of each user-item pair can be ac-
cessed via a well-trained conversion rate prediction model. How-
ever, for real E-Commerce platforms, there are unavoidable fac-
tors preventing us from learning such an accurate model. In or-
der to break the heavy dependence on accurate inputs of the util-
ity, we propose a general online traﬃc shaping protocol for online
E-Commerce applications. In our framework, we approximate the
function mapping the bonus scores, which generally are the only
method to inﬂuence the ranking result in the traﬃc shaping prob-
lem, to the numbers of exposures and purchases. Concretely, we
approximate the above function by a class of the piece-wise linear
function constructed on the convex hull of the explored data points.
Moreover, we reformulate the online traﬃc shaping problem as lin-
ear programming where these piece-wise linear functions are em-
bedded into both the objective and constraints. Our algorithm can
straightforwardly optimize the linear programming in the prime
space, and its solution can be simply applied by a stochastic strat-
egy to fulﬁll the optimized objective and the constraints in expec-
tation. Finally, the online A/B test shows our proposed algorithm
steadily outperforms the previous industrial level traﬃc shaping
algorithm.

1 INTRODUCTION
Most E-Commerce algorithms aim to improve transaction eﬃciency
by showing personalized items according to the interests of users,
which provides the basic power for the growth of the platform.
However, transaction eﬃciency is not the only business concern
in many cases. For example, the delivery timeliness is a vital fea-
ture aﬀecting the satisfaction of users, since users wish to receive
their package as soon as possible. Therefore, for the sake of op-
timizing the satisfaction of users, retail platforms will boost cer-
tain exposure for the items with better delivery timeliness. The
demand for such quantitative exposure boosting is fundamental in
E-Commerce operations and can be formulated as an online traf-
ﬁc shaping problem. The goal is to maximize the cumulative pur-
chase number while satisfying the constraints of the lowest expo-
sure number.

Traditional online traﬃc shaping algorithms assume that the
utility of each user-item pair can be accessed via an oracle model.
In other words, there exists a model that serves as an oracle to accu-
rately predict the probability of purchase when showing an item to
a user. With the assistance of the probabilities, the traﬃc shaping
problem can be further formulated as a linear program (LP). More-
over, by adopting the stochastic user arrival model, most existing
algorithms are based on the primal-dual framework, where dual
optimal prices are learned by solving a fractional LP with the prob-
abilities of revealed users and are used for subsequent assignments.
However, there are unavoidable factors that prevent us from learn-
ing an accurate model to predict the probabilities, such as the cold-
start problem, class-imbalance data set, and heavy noises in behav-
ior patterns. Therefore, the traditional online traﬃc shaping algo-
rithms can be ineﬀective in practice, leading to either non-optimal
purchase numbers or severe violation of the exposure constraints.
To break the heavy dependence on accurate probabilities, we
propose a novel and general online traﬃc shaping protocol for E-
Commerce platforms. Instead of trying to directly learn the dual
optimal prices with ranking scores, we treat the ranking model as
a component of the whole environment. In this environment, we
introduce functions that map the dual prices to the numbers of
exposure and purchase on each user group. For the ease of intu-
itive understanding, we rename the dual price as bonus score that
can be added to the model-output scores in the rest of this paper.
Since the bonus score is a continuous variable, we explore the func-
tion values on several points and approximate the function with a

piece-wise linear function constructed on the convex hull of the ex-
plored points. Moreover, we reformulate the online traﬃc shaping
problem as an LP where the piece-wise linear functions are embed-
ded into both the objective and constraints. The main diﬀerence
between our proposed LP and that used in existing online match-
ing algorithms is that the optimization variables of our proposed
LP are bonus scores, thus we directly optimize the LP in the pri-
mal space to obtain optimal bonus scores. Then we apply the opti-
mal bonus scores by a randomized combination of explored bonus
scores, which is shown to be better than a deterministic protocol.
The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

• We propose a general online traﬃc shaping protocol for E-
Commerce platforms to break the heavy dependence on ac-
curate probabilities in online traﬃc shaping problems.
• We proof that our proposed protocol achieves the optimal

solution in the stationary environments.

• The experiments on real applications exhibit the superiority

of our approach.

2 RELATED WORKS
A close research topic of traﬃc shaping is online matching [14].
Generally, online matching algorithms focus on optimizing the com-
petitive ratio given a user arriving model, e.g. [4, 6, 8, 9]. Some
recent works study the eﬃciency on converge [2, 3, 13], extension
versions for more general setting [1, 11, 12], and more complicated
user models [7, 17]. Diﬀerent from online matching, online convex
optimization involves learning frameworks and has been studied
in theory and practice [10]. Recent online convex optimization al-
gorithms study dynamic regret and can adapt to both stationary
and dynamic environments [5, 15, 16, 18]. Compared to them, our
study focuses on real-world scenarios, and aims to build the com-
plete process that uses the raw statistics data to improve the online
revenue which is a complicated black-box function.

3 PRELIMINARY
Our online platform has 𝑛 disjoint user groups 𝑈 = {𝑈1, 𝑈2, ..., 𝑈𝑛}
and target items set 𝑆 = {𝑆1, 𝑆2, ..., 𝑆𝑚 }. User groups are partitioned
by business experts and the users in the same group are likely to
have similar behaviors. In our online platform, items displayed to
users are ranked by their ranking scores, and we increase the expo-
sure of a target items set by adding the a bonus score to these items.
The bonus scores for items in the same target items set should be
the same, and they can be diﬀerent given diﬀerent users. Practi-
cally, there may be items which belong to two target items set, but
the amount of these items can be ignored. Therefore, we assume
target items sets are also disjoint.

For a traﬃc shaping task, our ﬁrst objective is to satisfy the low-
est exposures requirement of each target set 𝑆 𝑗 . Concretely, the total
exposure of items in target set 𝑆 𝑗 should be at least 𝑟 𝑗 . Our second
objective is to minimize the loss of clicks caused by the above expo-
sures requirement. Formally,

𝑠.𝑡 . Õ
1≤𝑖 ≤𝑛

𝑓𝑖 𝑗 (𝑥𝑖 𝑗 ) ≥ 𝑟 𝑗 , ∀𝑗 ∈ [1, 𝑚]

(1)

The non-decreasing function 𝑓𝑖 𝑗 (𝑥) represent the times that items
in the 𝑗-th set will be exposed for buyers in the 𝑖-th group when we
assign bonus score of 𝑗-th set to 𝑥 in expectation (to dispose the un-
certainty of an online environment). The non-increasing function
𝑔𝑖 𝑗 (𝑥) represent the times of total clicks (for all items) under the
same setting.

4 METHODOLOGY
We can observe that Equation 1 is a non-linear programming and
it is hard to solve it straightforwardly. The high level idea of our
solution is to estimate and break 𝑓 and 𝑔 into the sum of several
piece-wise linear functions. Without loss of generality, we assume
the bonus score is chosen from 0 to 1. We partition the interval
into 𝑘 + 1 sub-intervals and examine a ﬁxed set of bonus score
value 𝑇 = (0, 1/𝑘, 2/𝑘, ..., 1). We estimate the ground-truth value
(𝑓 (𝑥), 𝑔(𝑥)) for 𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑚 ∈ 𝑇 , denoted as ( ¯𝑓 (𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑚), ¯𝑔(𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑚)). Then, a
stochastic allocation can be proved to optimize the performance.
We demonstrate the process by pseudo code in Algorithm 1.

4.1 Proof of Main Theorem
We purify our theoretic contribution in the following theorem. Prac-
tically, we will choose a reasonably large parameter 𝑘 and go through
the steps in Algorithm 1.

Theorem 1. Assume | ¯𝑓𝑖 𝑗 (𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑚)−𝑓𝑖 𝑗 (𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑚)| < 𝜖1 and | ¯𝑔𝑖 𝑗 (𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑚)−
𝑔𝑖 𝑗 (𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑚)| < 𝜖2 for 𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑚 ∈ 𝑇 given monotonic and continuous func-
tion 𝑓𝑖 𝑗 and 𝑔𝑖 𝑗 . When 𝑘 goes to inﬁnity, there is a polynomial-time
protocol that produces the expected number of exposures ˆ𝑓𝑗 for each
target set 𝑗 and the global expected number of clicks ˆ𝑔, satisfying
E[ ˆ𝑓𝑗 ] + 𝑛𝜖1 ≥ 𝑟 𝑗 and 𝐸 [ ˆ𝑔] + 𝑛𝑚𝜖2 ≥ 𝑔∗ where 𝑔∗ is the global
optimality on clicks.

We ﬁrst introduce a series of lemmas to prove the theorem. The
ﬁrst lemma allows us to estimate the eﬀect of an arbitrary bonus
score by a stochastic combination of bonus scores that already
have been observed.

Lemma 1. Given values of 𝑓 and 𝑔 in two points 𝑥0 and 𝑥1, a sto-
chastic strategy can obtain exposures 𝜆𝑓 (𝑥0)+(1−𝜆)𝑓 (𝑥1) and clicks
𝜆𝑔(𝑥0) + (1 − 𝜆)𝑔(𝑥1) for any 𝜆 ∈ [0, 1] in the sense of expectation.

Proof. We can adopt the bonus score 𝑥0 with the probability of
𝜆 and the bonus score 𝑥1 with the probability of 1 − 𝜆. It is easy to
(cid:3)
see the desired result.

The following lemma introduces a special class of piece-wise
linear functions that can be written without conditions on pieces.

Lemma 2. Given a non-increasing, continuous, and piece-wise lin-

ear function 𝑔 separated by 𝑘 points {𝑠1, 𝑠2, ..., 𝑠𝑘 },

𝑔(𝑥) = {𝑘𝑖 (𝑥 − 𝑠𝑖) + 𝑏𝑖, 𝑠𝑖 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑠𝑖+1|𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑘 − 1]}.

(2)

The above formula can be written as

𝑔(Õ 𝑥𝑖 ) = 𝑏1 +

𝑘−1

Õ
𝑖=1

𝑘𝑖𝑥𝑖 if (𝑥𝑖 > 0 =⇒ 𝑥 𝑗 = 𝑠 𝑗+1 −𝑠 𝑗 , ∀𝑗 < 𝑖) (3)

The condition {𝑥 𝑗 = 𝑠 𝑗+1 − 𝑠 𝑗 , ∀𝑗 < 𝑖} implies that all previous 𝑥 𝑗

are maximized. If 𝑘𝑖 ≥ 𝑘𝑖+1 for each 𝑖, then

𝑔(𝑥) = 𝑏1 +

max
𝑥𝑖 ∈[0,𝑠𝑖+1−𝑠𝑖 ],

𝑥𝑖 =𝑥

Í

𝑘−1

Õ
𝑖=1

𝑘𝑖𝑥𝑖 ]

(4)

Proof. By the deﬁnition, we can see 𝑔(𝑠1) = 𝑏1. Consider the
process of value changing of 𝑔 when 𝑥 moves from 𝑠1 to 𝑠𝑘 . Its
gradient is 𝑘1 at the beginning. When the ﬁrst interval is exhausted
(i.e. 𝑥 ≥ 𝑠1), the speed of value changing becomes 𝑘2. Equation 3
limits the added portion of 𝑥 must be selected from left to right so
it is equivalent to the original deﬁnition of 𝑔(𝑥).

Equation 4 demonstrates a diﬀerent process where added por-
tion of 𝑥 is not constrained to from left to right. Because of the in-
creasing property of {𝑘𝑖 }, maximizing
𝑘𝑖𝑥𝑖 implies that 𝑥 should
after ﬁll the left interval before go right. Therefore, Equation 3 and
4 is equivalent with increasing {𝑘𝑖 }.

(cid:3)

The next lemma introduces a surrogate objective 𝑔𝑐 can promise
that {𝑘𝑖 } is increasing and objective value 𝑔𝑐 (𝑥) is not worse than
𝑔(𝑥) for each 𝑥.

Definition 1. The outer convex curve for a set of points {(𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖 )}
is obtain by eliminating (𝑥, 𝑦) if there exist (𝑥 ′, 𝑦′) and (𝑥 ′′, 𝑦′′) s.t.
𝑥 ′ ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑥 ′′ and (𝑦−𝑦′)·(𝑥 ′′−𝑥 ′) < (𝑥 − 𝑥 ′) · (𝑦′′ − 𝑦′). The outer
convex curve is the upper-half of a convex hull and can be computed
by the Graham’s scan algorithm.

Lemma 3. Given a monotone, continuous, piece-wise linear func-
tion 𝑔 separated by 𝑘 points {𝑠1, 𝑠2, ..., 𝑠𝑘 }, the new piece-wise linear
function 𝑓 𝑐 that describes the outer convex curve for {(𝑠
))}
satisﬁes 𝑓 𝑐 (𝑥) ≥ 𝑓 (𝑥) for an arbitrary 𝑥.

𝑘, 𝑓 (𝑠

′
𝑘

′

Proof. For 𝑠𝑖 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑠𝑖+1 and both (𝑠𝑖, 𝑓 (𝑠𝑖)) and (𝑠𝑖+1, 𝑓 (𝑠𝑖+1))
are in the outer convex curve, 𝑓 𝑐 (𝑥) = 𝑓 (𝑥). Otherwise, with-
out loss of generality, (𝑠𝑖, 𝑓 (𝑠𝑖)) can be eliminated by two points
(𝑥 ′, 𝑓 (𝑥 ′)) and (𝑥 ′′, 𝑓 (𝑥 ′′)) in the outer convex curve, which sat-
isﬁes 𝑥 ′ ≤ 𝑠𝑖 ≤ 𝑥 ′′and

(𝑓 (𝑠𝑖) − 𝑓 (𝑥 ′)) · (𝑥 ′′ − 𝑥 ′) < (𝑠𝑖 − 𝑥 ′) · (𝑓 (𝑥 ′′) − 𝑓 (𝑥 ′))

=⇒ 𝑓 (𝑠𝑖 ) < 𝑓 (𝑥 ′) +

(𝑠𝑖 − 𝑥 ′) · (𝑦′′ − 𝑦′)
𝑥 ′′ − 𝑥 ′

= 𝑓 𝑐 (𝑠𝑖)

(5)
Note that the singular case 𝑥 ′ = 𝑠𝑖 = 𝑥 ′′ is solved naturally. The
above result shows 𝑓 𝑐 ≥ 𝑓 at least on separated points, which can
extends to arbitrary points for piece-wise linear functions.

(cid:3)

Proof. (of Theorem 1) Let 𝑂𝐵 𝐽 the optimized value of objec-
tive in Equation 1. We ﬁrst transform Equation 1 by replacing 𝑓
and 𝑔 with the summation of linear functions in Equation 3. We
use ¯𝑓𝑖 𝑗𝑡 and ¯𝑔𝑖 𝑗𝑡 to represent the gradient of each linear function
(𝑘𝑖 in Equation 3), i.e. ¯𝑓𝑖 𝑗 (
𝑥𝑡 ) = ¯𝑓𝑖 𝑗 (0) +
¯𝑓𝑖 𝑗𝑡 𝑥𝑡 . After replac-
ing 𝑓 and 𝑔 with ¯𝑓 and ¯𝑔, we have

objective 𝑂𝐵 𝐽1. The gap between 𝑂𝐵 𝐽 and 𝑂𝐵 𝐽1 is the caused by
the approximation. Without consideration of constraints, the gap
between them is

Here 𝛿 is the diﬀerence of 𝑔 on adjacent separated points, which
can be removed when 𝑘 goes to inﬁnity. On the other hand, feasible
solutions of 𝑂𝐵 𝐽 may not be feasible for 𝑂𝐵 𝐽1 and vice versa. The
fulﬁllment of constraints can be similarly proved to have a bound
of 𝑛𝜖1 as above. Next, we are going to eliminate the last constraint

so that satisﬁes E[ ˆ𝑓𝑗 ] + 𝑛𝜖1 ≥ 𝑟 𝑗 and 𝐸 [ ˆ𝑔] + 𝑛𝑚𝜖2 ≥ 𝑔∗.

4.2 Online test
We examine our algorithm in the ANONYMOUS platform for a
month. The ANONYMOUS platform is one of the largest interna-
tional online E-Commerce platforms worldwide, and the targeted
set of items in this scenario is more than 10%, which has been a
heavy portion of the revenue. The baseline method is an industrial-
level traﬃc shaping protocol, which includes a PID module with
adjustments from a multi-arm bandit module and has been served
our platform for years. Intuitively, PID helps us achieve the expo-
sure requirements and the bandit module can select to push the
targeted items to the proper group of users in an online fashion.
Each examined method needs to serve more than millions of users
per day with support requirements for tens of targeted sets: guar-
antee a certain count of exposure for each day. We consider three
indicators in the online A/B test:

• Purchase Rate (PR). PR is computed as the number of pur-

chases divides by the number of served users.

Table 1: The relative gap on metrics.

From the above result, we can see traﬃc shaping has a nega-
tive inﬂuence on the possibility of purchase, but can expose much
more targeted items. Our proposed method can achieve better PR
and GMV (greater than 1.5%) than PID with eﬃciency selection
by the bandit module, which can be translated to a signiﬁcant im-
provement that prevents us from losing of millions GMV per day.
At the same time, our method can have a compatible CR, which im-
plies that our method can achieve the best trade-oﬀ on short-term
reward (PR and GMV) and long-term reward (CR) amongst exists
methods.

5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a new framework for traﬃc shaping in
E-Commerce. The proposed framework straightforwardly solves
the approximated version of original traﬃc shaping in expectation,
where no accurate conversion rate prediction model needs to be
included. The experimental result shows that it can steadily bring
revenue to our online system.
