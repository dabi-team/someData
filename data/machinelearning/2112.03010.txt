Abstract 

In recent years, increased wildfires have caused irreversible damage to forest resources worldwide, 
threatening  wildlives  and  human  living  conditions.  The lack  of  accurate  frontline  information in 

real-time can pose great risks to firefighters. Though a plethora of machine learning algorithms have 
been developed to detect wildfires using aerial images and videos captured by drones, there is a lack 
of methods corresponding to drone deployment. We propose a wildfire rapid response system that 

optimizes the number and relative positions of drones to achieve full coverage of the whole wildfire 
area.  Trained  on  the  data  from  historical  wildfire  events,  our  model  evaluates  the  possibility  of 

wildfires  at  different  scales  and  accordingly  allocates  the  resources.  It adopts  plane  geometry  to 
deploy  drones  while  balancing  the  capability  and  safety  with  inequality  constrained  nonlinear 
programming. The method can flexibly adapt to different terrains and the dynamic extension of the 

wildfire area. Lastly, the operation cost under extreme wildfire circumstances can be assessed upon 
the completion of the deployment. We applied our model to the wildfire data collected from eastern 

Victoria, Australia, and demonstrated its great potential in the real world.

1.  Introduction 

Wildfires are a big threat to ecological resources and human properties [1, 2]. Every year, a million 
acres of land are lost in those countries covered by large forest areas, including Australia, the United 

States,  Canada,  Brazil,  and  China  [3-7],  and  the  situation  is  increasingly  severe  due  to  the 
developing  climate  change  [8,  9].  During  the  2019-2020  fire  season  in  Australia,  devastating 

wildfires  broke  out  in  almost  every  state,  with  the  most  severe  impact  in  New  South Wales  and 
eastern  Victoria,  resulting  in  at  least  23  deaths,  more  than  1500  houses  destroyed,  millions  of 
hectares of land burned, and nearly 300 million animals killed or injured [10, 11]. With the rapidly 

evolving  global  warming,  it  is  foreseeable  that  the  frequency  and  severity  could  increase 
substantially in the next century [12]. There is an urgent need to address the problem effectively. 

 
 
 
 
Flame  and  smoke  detection  systems  have  been  widely  used  to  detect  wildfire  accidents  and 
alarm  the  concerned  authorities. The earlier  sensory technologies  succeeded  in  flame  and  smoke 

detection  in  relatively  small  spaces,  such  as in a  building, but  failed  when  applied  in  large  open 
spaces  because  they  require  close  proximity  to  the  objects.  In  addition,  most  of  them  fail  to 

accurately inform the fire's location, size, and growth rate, which are critical during wildfire fighting 
[13,  14].  The  recent  development  of  visual-based  fire  detection  techniques  partly  alleviated  the 
problem [15]. For example, based on random forests, Kwak et al. achieved a smoke detection rate 

of 93.2% and a false alarm rate of 2.2%, using features including the spatial-temporal visual patterns 
of intensity, wavelet energy, and motion orientation to generate feature vectors [16]. More recently, 

the  deep  learning-based  wildfire  detection  techniques  further  pushed  the  performance.  As  an 
example, inspired by the attention mechanism [17，  18], Cao et al.'s method achieved an accuracy 
rate of 97.8% [19]. 

Conventionally,  most  detection  systems  are  deployed  on  strategically  located  watchtowers 
equipped with cameras or sensors and satellites. However, watchtowers suffer from a limited range 

of view and the high cost of construction and maintenance. Though satellites have a relatively large 
field of view, they provide poor spatial and temporal resolution and extremely high operation costs 
[12,  20].  Lately,  a  promising  surrogate,  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  or  drones,  has  been 

proposed  and  quickly  become  popular  owing  to  their  flexibility,  maneuverability,  and  lower 
operation  cost.  In  addition,  they  can  be  easily  equipped  with  global  positioning  systems  (GPS), 

ultrahigh-resolution visual cameras, and radio communication devices. Drones are further advanced 
along with the improvement in portable power sources and operating software. Zhao et al. designed 
a  specialized  UAV  system  for  wildfire  monitoring  and  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  using 

saliency detection method and neural network in localization and recognition of wildfire based on 
aerial  images  [21].  Lee  et  al.  developed  a  wildfire  detection  system  based  on  deep  convolution 

neural network (CNN) architecture utilizing UAVs, where they achieved the best accuracy of 99% 
by remodeling GoogLeNet [22]. These methods highlighted the promising potential of using drones 
in wildfire detection and monitoring. 

Recently,  using  a  group  of  UAVs  to  maximize  fire  coverage  collaboratively  has  risen  in 
popularity. A vision-based fire perimeter tracking algorithm proposed in [23] enabled the UAVs to 

follow the edge of a wildfire autonomously for situational awareness. The UAV team in [24] can 
collaboratively track a dynamic environment in the case of wildfire spreading, following the border 
region of the wildfire while avoiding in-flight collisions and maintaining a safe distance to fire level. 

Shrestha et al. used a set of potential fields to track wildfire boundaries while minimizing energy 
consumption, which led to 100% coverage of the boundaries by UAVs and 78.1% energy remaining 

on  three  testing  scenarios  [25]. Advancement  in  using  teams  of  UAVs  greatly  expanded  UAVs' 
utility; however, it also highlighted the need for a sophisticated method to deploy drones. Many of 
the existing  methods  in  this  subject  only  achieve  full coverage  of  the  boundaries  rather  than  the 

entire  wildfire area.  Further,  due  to  the  dynamic  nature  of wildfire  propagation,  they  may  suffer 
from inefficient communication between the frontline and the concerned authority and incomplete 

fire  coverage  when  confronting  wildfires  at  extremely  large  scales.  We  thus  were  motivated  to 
develop a model to fill these gaps. 

In this work, we propose a method that comprehensively models topography, observational and 

communicational needs, and wildfire scale and frequency. The method maximizes the capability of 
drones  while  protecting  the  UAVs  and  firefighters  to  the  largest  extent  possible.  The  paper  is 

organized  as  follows.  Section  2  specifies  the  preliminaries  for  establishing  our  wildfire  rapid 
response model. Section 3 describes the architecture of the model in detail. In section 4, we show 

an application of our model to the target region in eastern Victoria, Australia, and lastly, section 5 
concludes the paper. 

2.  Preliminary 

Our  overall  Wildfire  rapid  response  system  includes  the  UAVs  system,  two-way  radio 
communication,  the  frontline  personnel,  and  the  concerned  authorities.  UAVs  system  consists  of 

drones carrying ultra high definition visual cameras for surveillance and situational awareness (SSA 
drones) and hovering drones equipped with radio repeaters located between the frontline and the 
relevant authorities to automatically rebroadcast signals and extend radio range (RR drones). Two-

way radio communication enables the firefighters to provide status reports to the relevant authorities 
and allows the latter to give orders to the forward teams. The frontline personnel carries handheld 

two-way  radios  operating  in the  ultra-high  frequency  (UHF;  radio  frequencies  ranging  from  300 
megahertz to 3,000 megahertz) or  very high frequency (VHF; radio frequencies ranging from 30 
megahertz  to  300  megahertz). Their  low transmitting  power  limits the  range  of  handheld  radios, 

typically a maximum  of  5  watts,  and  is  determined  mainly  by  distance  and  physical  topography 
(typically  5km  in  the  flat  region  and  unobstructed  ground)  while the  weather  has  little effect  on 

UHF/VHF signals. The range of the radio repeaters is also determined by distance and topography 
but is significantly greater than lower power handheld radios (10 watts; 20km in the flat region and 
unobstructed ground). Figure1 shows the overall flowchart of the whole system and some technical 

parameters of the UAV with types of equipment are presented in Table 1 below.

Before applying our wildfire rapid response system to a specific area such as Victoria, Australia, 
it is necessary to determine the regions that deserve more attention, especially when the resources 

are limited. Therefore, Fire Danger Rating (FDR), Restriction in Force Time (RIFT), Fire Frequency 
(FF) were selected as evaluation indicators [26]. The weight of the three indicators was calculated 

through the method of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). After collecting the specific values 
of  the  three  indicators,  the  method  of  Grey  Relational Analysis  (GRA)  was  adopted  to  finally 
determine  the  target  regions.  Let  𝑟𝑖   stand  for  the  gray  weighted  correlation  degree  of  the  i-th 
evaluated region compared with the ideal region. It reads 

3

𝑟𝑖 = ∑ 𝑞𝑘𝜉𝑖(𝑘)

, 

𝑘=1

where  𝑞𝑘  is  the  weight  of  the  k-th  evaluation  indicator, and  ξ𝑖(𝑘)is  the  gray correlation  degree 
coefficient. 

Considering  that  one  of  the  most crucial  parts  in  terms  of security  for  both  firefighters and 
drones is the extremely high temperature, the Heat Conduction Equation was introduced to describe 

the evolving temperature during the process of wildfire monitoring and fighting. Let T stand for the 
evolving temperature, and (x, y, z) is the space coordinates in the rectangular coordinate system. It 
reads

where t is time, k is the thermal conductivity coefficient, C and ρ stand for the heat capacity and the 
density, respectively, of the circumstance, φ stands for the temperature at t=0, and F is the ignition 

source intensity. The analytical solution of this equation can be obtained by the Fourier transform 
method. 

Additionally, the signal range of the handheld two-way radio communication in the UHF/VHF 
bands carried by the firefighters in the frontline will attenuate due to rock mass or other materials 
in the mountainous region. Let β stand for the attenuation coefficient. It reads 

β = w√

where  w   represents  the  angular  frequency  of  the  radio,  μ   and  σ   represent  the  magnetic 
permeability  and the  electric  conductivity  of  the  rock,  respectively, and  ε  denotes  the  dielectric 
coefficient of the rock. 

 
3.  Model and Methodology 

3.1 Horizontal range of the radio in the mountainous region 

Since  our  wildfire  rapid  response  model  emphasized  the  physical  topography,  which  was 
classified into, without loss of generality, two types of terrains-flat region and mountainous region, 
we aimed to firstly generate the three-dimensional terrain of the target region through the method 

of Lagrange’s interpolation based on the corresponding contour plot. For simplicity, we use cones 
to simulate the shape of the mountains approximately. Let H and R denote the height and the radius 

of the bottom of the cone, respectively (i.e., the altitude and the radius of the bottom of the mountain, 
correspondingly).   

While operating in the flat region and unobstructed ground, the signals of both the handheld 

radios  and  the  radio  repeaters  are  stable.  Let  L  denote  the  actual  range  of  the  handheld  radios. 
Obviously,  L = 5𝑘𝑚  in this circumstance. However, while moving in the mountainous region, the 
range will drop much lower due to rock mass and other materials. Assuming that the signal spreads 
through homogeneous media wherever in the air or other materials, it follows from basic knowledge 
of analytical geometry that 

L = √(√25 − 𝑧1

2𝑅(𝐻 − 𝑧0)

𝐻√25 − 𝑧1

], 

where  (𝑥1, 𝑦1, 𝑧1) and  (𝑥0, 𝑦0, 𝑧0)  denote the  space coordinates  of  the  drones and the  firefighters, 
respectively. For RR drones, moving within such a range will suffice to ensure that the signal emitted 

by the handheld radios can be received. 

However,  the  actual  flight  paths  of  the  drones  are  strictly  constrained  by  other  additional 

elements such as the evolving temperature. In order to minimize the total number of RR drones as 
much as possible while ensuring the  balance between capability and safety and other concerning 
factors,  it  is  more  advisable  to  replace  the  actual  range  of  the  radios  mentioned  above  with  the 

horizontal range. Let r denote the horizontal range, within which the radio communication between 
the firefighter and the drones is effective and safe enough, of the radio repeaters. This yields 

r = max (√𝐿2 − 𝑧1

2) ; 

T(𝑥1, 𝑦1, 𝑧1) ≤ 𝑇0, 
where  𝑇0  is the threshold temperature under which the drones can work efficaciously and safely. 
The scheme of the flyable area is shown in FigureS1. 

3.2 Rating and Prediction of the scales of wildfires 

Assuming  that  the  wildfires  start  to  ignite  from  a  certain  point  and  then  extend  to  the 

surroundings  with  a constant  speed  in  every  direction, the wildfire area  can  be  simplified into a 
circle with a constantly increasing radius. Since one of the purposes of our model is to optimize the 

deployment of the drones according to the scale and frequency of wildfire in the target region, it is 
necessary  to  first  provide  evaluation  metrics  to  rate  the  wildfires  at  different  scales,  and  further 
predict the changing likelihood of extreme wildfire accidents over the next decades. Specifically, 

we classified wildfires into three ratings based on the radius of the wildfire area-Rating 1 with a 
radius ranging from 0 to 10km, Rating 2 with a radius ranging from 10 to 40km, and Rating 3 with 

 
 
a radius beyond 40km. The evaluation metrics are shown in Table 2, where D represents the radius 
of  the  wildfire  area.  Furthermore,  because  the  wildfire  occurrence  only  relates  to  the  current 

conditions  but  is  not  directly  involved  with  the  historical  accidents  in  the  target  region,  such  a 
property  prioritizes  the  utilization  of  the  Markov  Model  to  forecast  the  changing  likelihood  of 

extreme wildfire accidents in the future. After collecting the information of the  previous wildfires 
with  different  sizes  and  classifying  them  into  different  ratings,  we  can  determine  the  random 
sequence  𝛼𝑠  and the corresponding state space E. After that, we can further calculate the one-step 
transition  probability  matrix  P  and  the limit  probability  of every  rating,  where  s  denotes  the  s-th 
wildfire accidents that occurred in the past.

3.3 Optimal number and relative positions of the SSA drones 

We  gave  priority to  the  number and  relative  positions  of  the  SSA  drones  when  the  scale  of 
wildfire  drops  within  Rating  1.  Let  d  be  the  horizontal  range  of  the  ultra  high  definition  visual 

cameras,  where  valid  images  and  videos  can  be  captured  for  wildfire  detection.  When  wildfire 
accidents  occur,  it  is  necessary  to  strategically  deploy  all  the  SSA  drones  to  achieve  complete 

coverage  of  the  wildfire  area  for  surveillance  and  situational  awareness  while  minimizing  the 
number of the SSA drones as much as possible. Therefore, the problem can be abstracted into using 
the  fewest  circles  with the  radius  of  d to completely  cover the  circle  with  the  radius  of  D. Let  n 

denote the minimum number of the former circles, and we have 

When D ≤ d, just one SSA drone will suffice to monitor the whole wildfire area.   

When  D  >  d,  we  used  the  circular  division  method  based  on  the  drawer  principle  and  the 

isosceles triangle method to achieve our purpose. This yields 

1                       0 < 𝐷 < 𝑑

However, when the value of D exceeds that of  2𝑐𝑜𝑠

, both the circular division method and 

the  isosceles  triangle  method  fail  to  achieve  complete  coverage  of  the  wildfire  area  with  the 

minimum number of the SSA drones. To address this problem, we improved our model by adopting 
the  cellular  network  coverage  method,  which  is  commonly  used  in  constructing  mobile 
communication base stations [27, 28]. The principle of this method is, in the context of our model, 

replacing the circles, which have the radius of d, with their inscribed regular hexagon and then layer 
by layer, densely and completely, covering the circle with the radius of D. The scheme is presented 

in Figure3. 

where the red part still represents the wildfire area, and the grey part is a series of inscribed regular

hexagons with the length of d. 

Still, let n represent the minimum number of the inscribed regular hexagons (i.e., the number 

of  the  SSA  drones). When 

𝐷

𝑑

≤ 5,  it  is  relatively  easy  to  find  the  relationship  between  n  and 

𝐷

𝑑

while 

𝐷

𝑑

> 5 ,  currently  there  is  no  unified  formula  that  can  precisely  describe  the  quantitative 

relationship  between  n  and 

𝐷

𝑑

 .  Though,  we  can  calculate  the  relationship  approximately  in  an 

appropriate way and control the error within an acceptable range. As shown in Figure4, when the 
boundary of the circle with the radius of D touches a series of points such as  𝐴1𝑗, 𝐴2𝑗, and  𝐵𝑗, a 
new layer of inscribed regular hexagons must be added to ensure the dense and complete coverage 
of the wildfire area. If the radius D is extremely large, the distance between  𝐴𝑖𝑗  and O, where O 
denotes the circle’s center, cannot be calculated precisely by a unified formula. Instead, we replaced 
this distance with the distance between  𝑀𝑗  and O approximately, where  𝑀𝑗  is the midpoint of the 
line segment  𝐴1𝑗𝐴2𝑗. Therefore, when the boundary touches  those midpoints such as  𝑀𝑗, a new 
layer  of  inscribed  regular  hexagons  is  added.  Let  𝜃𝑗  denote  the  angle  between  O𝐴1𝑗  and  O𝑀𝑗. 
Note that: 

 
 
lim
𝑗→∞

|𝑂𝑀⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ 𝑗|
|𝑂𝐴⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ 1𝑗|

= lim
𝑗→∞

𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃𝑗 = 1, 

which means that when radius D is extremely large, O𝐴1𝑗  and O𝑀𝑗  are approximately equal, and 
thus it is reasonable to replace O𝐴1𝑗  with O𝑀𝑗  so that we can finally conclude the formula that can 
determine the minimum number of SSA drones for any scale of wildfires:

3.4  Optimal  number  and  relative  positions  of  the  RR  drones  and  the  shortest 
deployment time 

Considering that the range of the handheld two-way radios is limited in the mountainous region, 
the  radio  repeaters  mounted  on  the  RR  drones  are  warranted  to  ensure  efficient  communication 
between  the  firefighters  and  the  concerned  authorities.  Since,  in  the  context  of  our  model,  the 

wildfire area extends in the shape of a circle, most of the firefighters extinguish and control the fire 
near  the  perimeter  of  the  wildfire  area. At  the  same  time,  the  SSA  drones  keep  monitoring  the 

evolving circumstance within the boundary. Therefore, for simplicity, it is sufficient to ensure that 
the signal emitted from the perimeter can be received by the radio repeaters so that the problem can 
be abstracted into using the fewest circles with the radius of r to completely cover the periphery of 

the circle with the radius of D. The scheme of the relative positions of the firefighters and the RR 
drones is presented in FigureS2.

Figure5. Scheme of the method of periphery coverage. 

In the context of our model, the RR drones always depart from the concerned authority, such 

as  the  EOC,  and  then  fly  to  and  hover  over  an  appropriate  position.  Since  we  had  finished  the 
optimization  of  the  deployment  of  the  SSA  drones,  we  aimed  to  further  optimize  the  relative 

positions of the RR drones and ensure they can automatically adapt to the dynamic extension of the 
wildfire area, as well as minimize the time to complete the deployment of the whole UAVs system, 
by continuously adopting the method of equally dividing the periphery. To achieve this, firstly, the 

concept of feasible region was proposed to describe the horizontal flyable region of the RR drones 
within which they can execute the tasks efficiently without entering the wildfire area. The symbol

wildfire area when m RR drones are deployed. Specifically, the cases  m = 1, 2, 3  correspond to

To ensure safety as well as flexibly adjust the relative positions during the dynamic extension 
of the wildfire area, the RR drones are designed to hover over the periphery of the circle with the 
radius  of  𝐶𝑚,  whose  center  coincides  with  that  of  the  wildfire  area.  More  specifically,  each  RR 
drone always hovers over one of the m equipartition points of the periphery when there are m RR 

drones deployed and their relative positions, meanwhile, remain unchanged. 

Our last purpose is to minimize the time to complete the deployment of our whole UAVs system 
based  on  all  our  previous  works,  and it  is  sufficient to  focus  on  the  m  equipartition  point that  is 

farthest from the concerned authority. We introduced the polar coordinate system in the context of 
our model, where the center of the wildfire area is the pole, and the symbol  ρ  denotes the pole axis. 
Let  𝑊𝑚   represent  the  farthest  m  equipartition  point  while  𝑆𝑚   and  𝑄𝑚   stand  for  the  distance 
between  𝑊𝑚   and  the  concerned  authority  and  the  minimum  deployment  time,  respectively. 
Obviously, the polar coordinate of  𝑊𝑚  reads

Assuming  that  the  concerned  authority  always  keeps  a  safety  distance  of  b  km  away  from  the 
boundary of the wildfire area, we have

3.5 Additional cost caused by retirement and replacement of the drones 

Extreme wildfire accidents sometimes last for even months, such as the 2019-2020 fire season 

in  Australia  [10,  11].  Long-term  operation  of  the  UAVs  system  under  extreme  wildfire 
circumstances will reduce the service lives of the drones because some of the components, such as 

the integrated circuits systems, are very sensitive to temperature. The high temperature will increase 
the collector current of the diode in the semiconductor devices, which will eventually lead the diode 
to  burn  out.  Therefore,  the  cost  caused  by  the  retirement  and  replacement  of  the  drones  under 

extreme wildfire circumstances has become a factor to consider. In order to quantify this additional 
cost, we adopted the Poisson distribution to describe the number of the retirements per unit time 

approximately. 

According  to  [29],  the  span  of  the  service  life  of  integrated  circuits  obeys  the  exponential 
distribution. Assume one month, without loss of generality, to be one unit time and t units time to 

denote the time of duration of the wildfire. Let X be a random variable that represents the service 
life of the drone with the probability  𝑝𝑖  describing the likelihood of retiring at the end of the i-th 
unit time, and  𝑌𝑖  be another random variable that represents the number of the drones that need to 
be replaced at the end of the i-th unit time. It follows from the memorylessness of the exponential 
distribution that: 

where  𝑡′  stands for the additional service life of the drone in general. This yields 

P{X > t + 𝑡′|𝑋 > 𝑡} =  𝑃{𝑋 > 𝑡′}, 

 
And thus 

𝑝𝑖 = 𝑝𝑖+1. 

𝑌𝑖 = 𝑌𝑖+1. 
Let  p = 𝑝𝑖 = 𝑝𝑖+1  and  Y = 𝑌𝑖 = 𝑌𝑖+1. Since the service life of each drone is independent, Y will 
obey the binomial distribution with parameters of  n + m  and p 

Y~B(n + m, p). 

When  the  wildfire  reaches  an  extremely  large  scale,  the  value  of  n + m   will  significantly 
increase simultaneously. Therefore, according to Poisson's Theorem [30], Y will obey the Poisson 
distribution with a parameter of (n + m)p 

Y~P((n + m)p). 

Letting u stand for the approximate number of drones that need to be replaced at the end of every 
unit time, we have 

where  (n + m)p  denotes the mathematical expectation of Y. 

u = ⌈(n + m)p⌉, 

Assuming the unit price of each drone equipped with either ultra high definition visual camera 
or radio repeater stays constant, for simplicity, let c denote the unit price,  and  𝐺1  represents the 
additional cost caused by the retirement and replacement of the drones, and  𝐺0  represents the total 
cost of the whole UAVs system. Obviously, we have 

And 

𝐺1 = 𝑢𝑡𝑐. 

𝐺0 = (𝑛 + 𝑚 + 𝑢𝑡)𝑐. 

4.  Model Application and Results 

Considering that the 2019-2020 fire season demonstrably exposed the ecosystems of Victoria, 
Australia to an unprecedented extent of high severity, as well as the fact that this area has a long 
history confronting with frequent and destructive wildfires [11], which can provide our model with 

a significant amount of data, we applied our wildfire rapid response system to this area following 
the sequence introduced in section 3.   

Victoria  is  divided  into  nine  fire  protection  zones  [31]. After  collecting  the  exact  time  and 
location of a series of historical fire events in Victoria from 1851 to 2021 [26, 31], particular regions 
that deserve more attention when the resources are limited were firstly  filtered by our model. The 

values of the three indicators corresponding to each fire protection zone are presented in Table 3.

The weight of the three indicators was calculated as [0.539, 0.248, 0.213], and thus the results 
of the gray weighted correlation degree were reached 
[𝑟7, 𝑟9, 𝑟8, 𝑟6, 𝑟4, 𝑟5, 𝑟3, 𝑟2, 𝑟1] = [0.921, 0.792, 0.710, 0.600, 0.579, 0.532, 0.319, 0.142, 0.137] 
Therefore, Central, East Gippsland, West and South Gippsland, and North East were selected as the 
target region where our UAVs system applied. 

The four fire protection zones are located in eastern Victoria, with elevations ranging from sea 

level on the coast to 1986 meters on Mount Bogong. For simplicity, we mainly exerted our model 
to  Mount  Bogong.  The  simulated  three-dimensional  topographic  map  is  presented  in  FigureS4, 

where  H=1.986km  and  R=13km. Assuming  that,  without  loss  of  generality,  the  altitude  of  the 
firefighter’s position is 0.9km, and the attenuation coefficient is 0.4, we approximately calculated 
that  r ≈ 3.3001km in the mountainous region and  r ≈ 4.97km in the flat region according to the 
Monte Carlo Method. 

Based on the Evaluation metrics of the scales of wildfire presented in Table 2, we arrived at 

𝛼𝑠 = {3,1,3,2,2,3,1,3,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,1,2,1,3,2,3,1,1,2,2,1,1,3,3}, 

where s = 1, 2, 3,…, 30, 
and 

and 

E = {1,2,3},

Since the matrix is regular and the Markov chain is ergodic, we calculated the limit probability of 
every rating in the state space E as below 

𝑃𝑠 =   (

which means the probability of the occurrence of extreme wildfire accidents in the future is

. 

Since the SSA drones and the RR drones operate during the process of wildfire detection and 
monitoring  synchronously,  we  assumed  that,  without  loss  of  generality,  d  is  always  equal  to  r. 

Considering that each drone has a maximum flight time of 2.5hr and a recharge time of 1.75hr, we 
assumed that when a drone is recharging, another drone will replace it for either surveillance and 

situational awareness or extending the radio range. When the scale of wildfire drops within Rating 

1,  the  quantitative  relationship  between  the  total  number  of  the  UAVs  and  the  value  of

the radius of the wildfire area ranging from 40km to 66km are presented in Table 4.

In practice, the position of the concerned authority usually keeps a safe distance away from the 
boundary of the wildfire area. In the context of our model, we assumed that b=5km to calculate the 

values  of  𝐶𝑚   and  𝑄𝑚 .  The  quantitative  relationship  between  𝐶𝑚 ,  𝑄𝑚 ,  and  the  value  of 

𝐷

𝑟

corresponding to either the flat region or the mountainous region are presented in Figure8 (a) and 
Figure8 (b), respectively. 

Figure8. Quantitative relationship between  𝐶𝑚,  𝑄𝑚, and

As can be observed from Figure8, the result of the quantitative relationship either between  𝐶𝑚  and 

𝐷

𝑟

   or  between  𝑄𝑚   and 

𝐷

𝑟

   is  the  emergence  of  a  piecewise  function,  which  means  the  optimal 

relative  positions  of  the  RR  drones  and  the  shortest  deployment  time  of  the  UAVs  system  will 

change abruptly at some point instead of continuously during the extension of the wildfire area both 
in  the  flat  region  and  the  mountainous  region.  In  addition,  we  observed  a  positive  association 

between  𝑄𝑚  and 

𝐷

𝑟

, where longer deployment time is associated with a larger scale of wildfire. It 

is  worth  noting  that  𝐶𝑚   piecewisely  shows  a  negative  association  with 

𝐷

𝑟

   from  the  beginning. 

However,  this  association  gradually  becomes  positive  when 

𝐷

𝑟

≥ 1 ,  which  is  determined  by  the 

characteristics of our method of equally dividing the periphery. 

Additionally,  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  due  to  several  assumptions  in  the 

application  of  our  model,  such  as  the  abstraction  of  the  shape  of  mountains  and  the 
attenuation coefficient caused by the rock mass and other materials in the mountainous region. 

 
 
 
 
 
Specifically, we exerted the sensitivity analysis to the value of  𝑧0  and β by fixing the value of 
H to 2km. The results are presented in Figure9, 

Figure9. Results of the sensitivity analysis. 

where the abscissa axis represents the value of R, the radius of the bottom of the mountain, and 
the  vertical  axis  represents  the  value  of  r,  the  horizontal  range  of  the  radio  repeaters.  It  can  be 
observed from Figure9 that our model is robust and has good stability in terms of calculating the 

horizontal range of the radio repeaters. 

5.  Conclusions 

We proposed a novel wildfire rapid response system that achieves full coverage of the whole wildfire 

area for both wildfire detection and monitoring. We focused on the optimal deployment of the UAVs 
and how it can automatically adapt to different wildfire circumstances. The strengths of our model 

include  its  flexibility  and  automaticity  of  dealing  with  wildfire  accidents  in  different  physical 
topologies and its ability to adapt to the changing likelihood of extreme wildfire accidents in the 
target region. The self-adjustment of the deployment during the dynamic extension of the wildfire 

area ensures that the model can complete the optimal deployment of our whole UAVs system as 
quickly as possible. Furthermore, our model can achieve full coverage of the whole wildfire area 

rather than only the boundaries and the balance among capacity, safety, and economics. With the 
valid data of the historical wildfire events in the target region, our model can evaluate the possibility 
of wildfires at different scales and accordingly allocate the resource. The application of our system 

to the target regions in eastern Victoria, Australia showed the great potential of our model in the real 
world. 

Though, some limitations of the current work should be recognized. First, our analysis largely 
relies on the historical data of the previous wildfire events in the target region, and thus it might 
easily be subject to data limitation, especially in those regions where the wildfire is rare. Second, 

our  model  only  focuses  on  two types  of  terrains-flat  region  and  mountainous  region,  but  in  real 
world,  there  can  be  a  mixture  of  the  two  types.  Further  prospective  studies  with  more  powerful 

 
 
 
 
mathematical instruments dealing with the impact of complex topography on the range of radio are 
warranted to validate the potential adaptability of our wildfire rapid response system in the mixed 

type  of  terrains.  Lastly,  we  assumed  the  wildfire  area  to  be  a  circle  with  a  constantly  extending 
radius,  which is  likely  to  be  violated  when  the  shape  of  the  wildfire  area is  almost  always  more 

irregular and even three-dimensional. These aspects shall be considered in future works. 

No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.
