Abstract  

Molecular  communication  (MC)  implemented  on  Nano  networks  has  extremely 
attractive characteristics in terms of energy efficiency, dependability, and robustness. 
Even  though,  the  impact  of  incredibly  slow  molecule  diffusion  and  high  variability 
environments  remains  unknown.  Analysis  and  designs  of  communication  systems 
usually  rely  on  developing  mathematical  models  that  describe  the  communication 
channel. However, the underlying channel models are unknown in some systems, such 
as MC systems, where chemical signals are used to transfer information. In these cases, 
a new method to analyze and design is needed. In this paper, we concentrate on one 
critical  aspect  of  the  MC  system,  modelling  MC  received  signal  until  time 𝑡,  and 
demonstrate that using tools from ML makes it promising to train detectors that can be 
executed  well  without  any  information  about  the  channel  model.  Machine  learning 
(ML) is one of the intelligent methodologies that has shown promising results in the 
domain. This paper applies Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) for flexible pavement 
maintenance regressions problems and solutions. For prediction, four parameters  are 
used as inputs: the receiver radius, transmitter radius, distance between receiver and 
transmitter, and diffusion coefficient, while the output is mAP (mean average precision) 
of  the  received  signal.  Azure  ML  enables  algorithms  that  can  learn  from  data  and 
experiences and accomplish tasks without having to be coded. In the established Azure 
ML, the regression algorithms such as, boost decision tree regression, Bayesian linear 
regression,  neural  network,  and  decision  forest  regression  are  selected.  The  best 
performance is chosen as an optimality criterion. Finally, a comparison that shows the 
potential  benefits  of  Azure  ML  tool  over  programmed  based  tool  (Python),  used  by 
developers on local PCs, is demonstrated.

1.  INTRODUCTION  

  Nano-technology facilitate the development of nanometer-scale devices [1]. A Nano 
machine is the most fundamental primary component for performing basic occupations 
such  as  computing,  data  storage,  actuation,  and  sensing.  Communication  between 
Nano-machines will increase the complexity and range of operation of individual nano-
machines' capabilities and applications [2].  

  Molecular  communication  (MC)  is  the  most  promising  technique  for  nanoscale 
communication. Molecules in MC transmit information across an aqueous medium [3]. 

1 

 
The information can be encoded in terms of time of release, concentration, or molecule 
type [4]. Nano network, a future framework, is designed with the inter-connection of 
Nano-machines.  Modeling  of  Nano  networks  has  been  proposed  in  biomedical, 
environmental, and military applications [5]. 

  The  Internet  of  Bio-Nano  Things  (IoBNT)  is  presented  as  a  network  of  biological 
components and nano-machines that communicate with one another and the internet to 
empower different applications such as healthcare-monitoring. Additionally, MC has 
emerged as the most capable nano-scale communication prototypical for IoBNT [6].       

   Moreover,  it  has  been  identified  as  a  potential  upcoming  application  in  the  health 
field, and we can see this in disease monitoring/therapy/diagnosis [7] as well as target 
drug-delivery (TDD) [8]. 

  Detection  techniques  are  very  important  for  the  trustworthy  retrieval  of  the  signal 
directed from a communication source, in which the concentration encoded signal is 
calculated from the degraded variety detected at the decoder [9]. Detection technique 
design and analysis have traditionally relied on computational models that describe the 
transmission  process,  signal  and  receiver  noise  propagation,  and  many  other 
components of end-to-end signal transmission and reception [10]. 

    MC relies on chemical signal and doesn’t use electromagnetic (EM) signals, and the 
consistent  source  model  may  be  unidentified  or  mathematically  irreconcilable.  One 
solution to this problem is using detection techniques inspired by ML [11] which can 
be used to design detection techniques that can learn directly from data. 

    It  is  clear  that  there  are  no  research  creativities  in  the  field  of  MC-based  signal 
detection of the received signal until time 𝑡 using automated ML. In a production-ready 
environment, model automation is frequently disregarded. As a result, we investigate 
automation  in  the  proposed  work  to  make  the  model  accessible  to  the  end-user. 
Whenever  there  is  a  requirement  to  run  computationally  complex  ML  models, 
automation is usually required. For automation, one viable solution to examine is ML 
as a service (MLaaS) [12]. Automated ML implies that scientists do not need to create 
a logistic regression or a neural network model from zero but may utilize the benefits 
of automated algorithmic components offered on MLaaS [13]. As a proof of concept, 
the work of automation is accomplished utilizing the MLaaS model. Typically, the data 
which ML programs rely on it is challenging to process and store. It affords a robust 
and effective crossing point that allows ML specialists to carry out experiments with 
their datasets rather than worrying about storage, compute, or networking issues [14]. 
When  the  difficulty  of  data  grows,  ML  poses  numerous  difficulties.  As  a  result, 
automating an ML activity becomes critical. 

    Hyper-Parameter Optimization (HPO) is without a doubt one of the most important 
aspects of automated ML [15], which is regularly challenging to attain. As a result, in 
the proposed scheme, we used Azure ML, a production-ready tool, to ease designing 
ML infrastructure. Essentially, it is critical to recognize a significant variance between 
implementing algorithms on a device and software as a service portal. However, it is 
worth noting that all of these algorithms are performed on an MLaaS prototype, which 
allows for extensive fully automated tuning of hyper-parameters, significantly lowering 
human work and time. Azure ML, when combined with  ML Operations, aids  in  the 
improvement of workflow performance. Traditional ML frameworks' credibility in a 
real-time scenario involving massive networking data is highly dubious. However, if 
the  focus  is  given  on  the  use  of  MLaaS  settings  such  as  BigML,  Algorithmic,  Data 

2 

 
Robot [16], and Azure ML (as in the proposed work), it can greatly assist in achieving 
load balancing or auto-scaling [17], [18]. 

    In this study, MC received signal is modeled with different regression algorithms in 
Azure  ML.  The  following  regression  algorithms  are  applied:  Bayesian  regression, 
neural  network  regression,  random  forest  regression,  and  boosted  decision  tree 
regression. According to the experimental results, the best method is identified. In this 
work,  it  is  illustrated  that  establishing  an  end-to-end  MC  system  on Azure  ML  is  a 
simple and efficient task with numerous algorithms to choose from. Also, a comparison 
between Azure ML as a visual tool and Python as textual- codes based tool is shown. 

2.  Overview and Related works of the Visual programming language (VPL) 

   Software development is critical in today's age of information technology for meeting 
the  needs  of  businesses  and  organizations  for  high-quality  information  systems. 
Creating  high-quality,  dependable,  scalable,  efficient,  user-friendly,  and  affordable 
software is not easy. Thus, there is an increasing request for software development tools 
that  are  simple  to  learn,  versatile,  and  productive  [19].  Various  components  of  the 
software  development  process  have  changed  due  to  the  sophistication  of  software 
requirements, and many tools have been invented to assist programmers. Large projects 
require integrated development environments (IDEs) such as NetBeans, Eclipse, and 
Microsoft Visual  Studio. While  using  these  tools,  programmers  must  understand  the 
general programming paradigms and the rigorous syntactic of each scripting language 
used. The program representation in the source code of these tools is limited to text, as 
photos  and  graphics  cannot  be  included.  Furthermore,  the  more  sensitive  the 
programming language is, the more complicated its syntax becomes, making it harder 
to understand and code. This contest made it more attractive to use VPLs, which catch 
more programmers and increase software development productivity [20]. 

   VPLs allow the creation of computer programs and applications by means of multi-
dimensional  visual  representation,  and  they  give  a  programming  system  based  on 
communication with graphical features that combine Text, Shapes, Colors, and Time, 
rather than writing textual code-base [21]. VPLs enhance the techniques through which 
programmer's express information presentation and processing. They employ images, 
animations,  drawings,  and  icons  to  help  users  understand  and  change  the  outcomes 
visually [22]. 

   There are a lot of VPLs on the market right now, but the most popular and commonly 
used ones  are academic  programs  like Scratch, Alice, and Kodu, or domain-specific 
tools  like  Azure  ML,  and  LabVIEW  (Data  Acquisition,  Instrument  Control,  and 
Industrial  Automation).  Wide-ranging-purpose  VPL  such  as  Limnor,  Tersus,  and 
Envision [22]. 

   We will go over a few of the most successful VPLs in the next subsection. Forms/3 is 
an example of a form-based VPL; diagrammatic VPLs include LabVIEW and Tersus, 
and icon-based VPLs include Limnor and Kodu [23]. 

  Scratch is a program developed by the MIT Media Lab. It is a novel VPL platform 
that  allows  you  to  make  interactive  stories,  games,  cartoons,  songs,  and  artwork. 

3 

 
 
 
Scratch allows instructors to minimize students' mental workload when they first begin 
learning to program [24]. 

    Kodu is a teaching tool. Microsoft Research created. It is a brand-innovative icon-
based VPL designed exclusively for video game production. It covers the fundamentals 
of game production. It is intended to be user-friendly for kids and fun for all. Kodu is 
event-driven, with each line of code consisting of a circumstance and an activity [25]. 

  Alice  is  a  VPL  that  allows  users  to  modify  objects  in  3D  environments.  Carnegie 
Mellon University was responsible for its creation. It  allows students to know about 
programming ideas based object-oriented without dealing with the grammar issues that 
text-based programming languages might cause. A program writer in a GUI setting uses 
Alice to choose programed constructions and method commands from a list of options 
[26]. 

   Scratch, Kodu, and Alice are only used for educational purposes. Furthermore, at the 
student level, Scratch and Kodu are limited. On the other hand, Alice can be utilized by 
teachers and other inexperienced programmers to investigate computational reasoning 
principles [27]. 

  LabVIEW is a diagrammatic VPL designed for scientists and engineering; it is not a 
free  program.  It  is  a  visual  platform  with  built-in  data  capture,  process  control, 
measurements  analysis,  and  descriptive  statistical  features  [28].  The  operation  of 
LabVIEW is decided by a layout of the graphical block diagram on which the program 
writer links diverse functions node by wires [29]. 

   Tersus is another form of a diagrammatic VPL. It was established by Tersus Software 
Ltd.'s. It is designed to help developers create sophisticated web-based applications by 
graphically describing operator interfaces, user behavior, and server operations. It's a 
general-purpose programming language for creating flow diagrams and interacting with 
applications. [30]. 

   Limnor is a VPL for Visual Studio.NET that is based on icons. It developed by Long 
Flow Enterprises Limited. It can make various applications, including online interactive 
kiosks,  sales  promotions,  database  management  systems  with  responsive  query,  and 
business  administration  systems. This  tool  can  be  used  by  non-technical  individuals 
[31]. Limnor, unlike the other tools, is not freeware and requires payment to obtain a 
copy. Furthermore, Limnor exclusively generates code in C#. 

   PWCT (programming without coding) is general purpose visual language that support 
textual code generation in many programming languages including Python (So can be 
used in ML applications based on Python libraries and frameworks) [22]. 

3.  System model  

  The  system  model,  which  we  proposed  in  [32],  is  used  in  this  study. As  shown  in 

Figure 1, both the transmitter and the receiver have unique radiuses and are spherical 

surfaces. This study is focused on a trapezoidal-container. As a result, molecules in the 

4 

 
 
container will float from the transmitter to the receiver, touching the receiver's surface 

to  the  transmitter's  surface.  The  sphere's  sample  points  construct  the  molecules  at 

random on the transmitter sphere dimension. The molecules are supposed to represent 

a random walk through the container. with the positions changing at random because 

noise is introduced to the molecule's location as presented in equation 1 and 2. 

                                             {

𝑥 → 𝑥 + ∆𝑥

                                                                 (1) 

                                       {

                                                                 (2)

   where D is the coefficient of Diffusion, and ∆→discrete time step. 

A  Gaussian  distribution  is  used  to  generate  the  random  noise,  with  mean  =  0,  SD 

(standard deviation) = 2 * D *. 

The striking molecules are reflected back into the container at the container surface.

   The reflection is only in the 𝑥 and 𝑦 directions, 𝑧 will remain unaffected according to 
the equations above. As the molecules float, their positions change, causing some to 
collide with the container's surface. Likewise, there is an option to determine a variable 
numerically,  such  as  with  the  particle's  reflecting  location  after  colliding  with  the 
container. The procedure will continue until the molecules reach the receiver's surface. 
The molecules are absorbed when they come into contact with the receiver surface. As 
a  result,  the  container  and  receiver  may  absorb  the  same  number  of  molecules 
cumulatively.  In  this  scenario,  the  procedure  can  go  on  for  up  to  3000  rounds. The 
probability is that an accumulated precision of molecules striking the receiver's surface 
is  determined,  which  is  performed  by  adding  the  number  of  molecules  striking  the 
surface at all-time 𝑡, and then dividing the value by the entire number of molecules. 
After  3000  rounds,  this  technique  returns  the  percentage  or  mean  average  precision 
(mAP). After that, the mAP is then derived by taking the average of the precisions.

language) to code-based language like Python. 

B.  Experimentation Platform 

    Microsoft Azure ML Studio "(https://studio.azureml.net)" was chosen to develop a

Azure Machine Learning [33] is a cloud-based solution that allows the implementation 
of ML procedures. Azure is a public cloud platform from Microsoft. The following are 
some of the advantages of adopting the public cloud computing platform (Azure ML): 
processing large amounts of data and allowing the admission from any location. The 
procedure of Azure ML is shown in Figure 2. Azure ML comes with a graphical tool 
for managing the ML process, data pre-processing modules, a set of ML algorithms, 
and an API for launching models into apps. Azure ML is a graphic tool that allows the 
user  to  regulate  the  procedure  from  start  to  finish,  including  data  pre-processing, 
running experiments with ML approaches, and testing the final model. MLS also assists 
customers in deploying their models to the clouds. 

Fig.2 Block diagram of the azure ML experiment procedure. 

The following are the Azure ML components: 

  A  graphical  tool  that  can  be  used  to  manage  the  entire  process  from  start  to 
finish. The ML team can use this tool to apply pre-processing data modules to 
raw data, perform experiments using an ML algorithm on the prepared data, and 
test the resulting model. When a good model is found, MLS assists its users in 
deploying it on Microsoft Azure.

C.  Generation of training and testing data 

   There  is  only  one  mAP  per  simulation,  and  the  simulation  is  specified  by  the 
simulation parameters. The radius of the receiver (𝑟𝑅), the radius of the transmitter (𝑟𝑇), 
the distance between the receiver and the transmitter (𝑑), and the diffusion coefficient 
(𝐷) are among these characteristics. Table 1, the selected model parameters are utilized 
to forecast mAP (mean average precision).

[𝑅𝑇, 𝑅𝑅, d, D]       →            mAP 

    This  simulation  is  essentially  run  with  various  simulation  parameter,  resulting  in 
various mAP. The models are then developed, which map the simulation parameters 
with  the  determined  mean  average  precision.  The  data  is  acquired  by  altering  the 
various  system  settings  and  running  the  simulation  to  obtain  each  value  of  mAP,  as 
shown  in  Figure  3. After  obtaining  the  first  set  of  findings,  data  was  collected  by 
modifying the system's parameters and running the simulation again to obtain the mAP 
values for each dataset.

Models that come pre-installed with Azure:- 

a)  Bayesian Linear Regression 

In the Bayesian technique, Bayesian inference is applied [34]. Equations 8-9-10-11 are 
used to determine the normal distribution in the Bayesian technique. Due to the fact 
that, 𝑤 is random variable with a continuous value in 𝑅𝑑, According to the Bayes rule, 
𝑦 is the posterior distribution of 𝑤. 

𝑃(𝑤|𝑦)   ∝  𝑃(𝑦|𝑤) 𝑃(𝑤)                                                                                                                                    (8) 

P(w|y)   ∼  N (μ . S)                                                                                                                                                (9)

The predictive distribution in Bayesian linear regression is computed using Equation 
12: 

𝑃(𝑌𝑛𝑒𝑤|𝑦. 𝑋|𝑥𝑛𝑒𝑤. 𝜎2)   =  𝑍 𝑃(𝑌𝑛𝑒𝑤 |𝑤 . 𝑋. 𝑥𝑛𝑒𝑤. 𝜎2)𝑃(𝑤|𝑋) 𝑑𝑤                                           (12) 

Predictive statistics analyses the probability of a value 𝑦0 set 𝑥0  for a specific 𝑤, by 
using likelihood. Lastly, add together all the potential values of 𝑤. 

b)  Neural Network Regression 

Because neural network regression is a supervised learning technique, it necessitates a 
labeled  dataset  with  a  label  column  [35].  Because  a  regression  model  predicts  a 
numerical value, the label column must also be numerical. 

  You can run the model using Train Model or Tune Hyper-parameters with the model 
and the tagged dataset as input. After then, the trained model can be utilized to predict 
values  for  extra  input  samples.  The  following  Eq.  (13)  is  used  in  neural  network 
regression: 

∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑥𝑖

𝑀
𝑖=0

= 𝑤 ∙ 𝑥                                                                                                      (13) 

   A perceptron is used in Neural Networks to calculate the linear combinations of inputs 
given a vector of real-valued inputs. If the output exceeds a certain threshold, it returns 
1, else -1. The weights must be computed using the perceptron training criteria (Eq. 14 
and 15):

c)  Decision Forest Regression 

   Non-parametric decision tree algorithm proceeds through a binary tree structure until 
they approach a leaf node, conducting a series of simple evaluations on each instance 
(choice) [36]. 

   This  regression  model  is  made  up  of  a  collection  of  decision  trees.  Each  tree  in  a 
regression decision forest predicts a Gaussian distribution. The ensemble of trees in the 
model  is  aggregating  to  find  a  Gaussian  distribution  that  is  closest  to  the  mutual 
distribution for all trees in the model. The Gini value is utilized in Random Forest to 
determine the tree's final class. The coefficient of the Gini is derived using Eq. 16: 

𝑛

𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖(𝑇) = 1 − ∑(𝑝𝑗)

                                                                                 (16) 

𝑖

  Where T dataset is divided into 𝑇1 ,𝑇2 subsets with 𝑁1, 𝑁2dimensions, then Gini split 
value is estimated based on the following Eq. 17: 

𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑡(𝑇) =

𝑁1

𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖(𝑇1)+

𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖(𝑇2)                                                 (17) 

d)  Boosted Decision Tree Regression 

In Azure ML, boosted decision tree is one of the most common predictive algorithms 
that  can  be  used  for  both  classification  and  regression  [37].  The  weighted  sum  of 
functions is used in this approach to optimize a differentiable loss function. The 𝐹(𝑥) 
is estimated based on Eq. (18): 

𝐹0(𝑥) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛 ∑ 𝐿(𝑦𝑖 . 𝛾)

𝑛
𝑖

                                                                                    (18) 

5.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

The focus of this experiment is on the 'prediction of the received signals in MC system 
(Map  values)'  module.  However,  it  is  illustrated  in  a  typical  Azure  regression 
experiment process, i.e. input data, initialize model, train model, score model, assess 
model, for a better understanding of the module's function and potential reuse. Figure 
4 depicts the experiment workflow.

Fig.4 the experiment workflow process. 

   Datasets are obtained from the simulation study and framework that have been done 
previously  in  [32].  There  is  a  file  called  simulation.csv.  In  simulation.csv,  there  are 
numerous features such as the receiver radius, transmitter radius, the distance between 
the receiver and the transmitter, and the diffusion coefficient while the output is mAP. 
Firstly, Create a new experiment as the initial step. Then, the simulation.csv creates a 
dataset.  Feature selection and feature  extraction are the next  steps. Then, apply data 
split  to  the  dataset  into  training  and  testing  dataset.  After  that,  we  apply  the  chosen 
regression  model.  Finally,  we  evaluate  the  trained  regression  model's  performance.

   The coefficient of determination (CoD) is a number between 0 and 1 that measures 
the model's predictive power. It's a common method of determining how well a model 
matches the data. It can be thought of as the percentage of variation that the model can 
explain. A larger proportion suggests a better fit, with 1 indicating a perfect match. To 
express  our  accuracy,  we  employed  the  CoD  factor.  Furthermore,  with  the  Boosted 
Decision  Tree  Regression  approach,  the  maximum  prediction  success  in  estimates 
employed is 0.99, as shown in Figure 6.

   In  our  previous  work  [32],  different  regression  approaches  (e.g.,  support  vector 
regression, linear regression, and ridge regression) have been applied for modeling MC 
received signal until time 𝑡 using python.  

   In  this  work,  we  notice  that  regression  models  (e.g.,  Boosted  Decision  Tree 
Regression) perform significantly better than the algorithms used in [32], and that high 
performance does not necessitate extensive optimization, as shown in Figure 8. Because 
we built our NN model with a standard topology, the model's performance may suffer 
as a result. This can be well thought-out as one of the intimidations to the authority of 
this work. Furthermore, because our experiments were conducted on a specific dataset, 
the results may differ on other types of datasets. For modelling MC received signals, 
we recommend that specialists use the Boosted Decision Tree Regression algorithm.

8.  A comparison between Azure ML and Python algorithms 

    There has never been a comparison of the performance of Azure ML services vs on 
premise ML algorithms provided by code-based tools (such as Python). The aim of this 
work is to compare the performance of two well-known software, Azure ML (visual 
cloud solution) and Python including ML libraries and tools (scikit-learn and tensor 
flow) (on-basis code solution), on detecting the incoming signal in the MC framework 
case. The RMSE is the evaluation measures utilized in this work to deliver a primary 

14 

 
 
 
 
measureable evaluation of the performances of Azure ML and comparable algorithms 
in Python. 
 In the first case, the comparison is based on algorithms that were similar, equally Azure 
and  Python  provide  the  same  algorithm.  The  selected  algorithm  is  Linear 
Regression(LR).  In  Table  5  is  presented  that  both  Azure  ML  and  Python  deliver 
algorithm with good accuracy.

     In  the  following  Table  6,  we  compare  the  RMSE  values  of  LR  for  different 
parameters  setting  using  Azure  ML.  For  solution  method,  we  applied  ordinary  least 
square and online gradient descent. 

  Ordinary least square is a linear regression approach that is widely utilized. The 
loss function estimates error as the sum of the squares of the distance between 
the real value and the anticipated line, then minimizes the squared error to fit 
the  model.  This  approach  assumes  a  strong  linear  relationship  between  the 
inputs and the dependent variable. 

  Gradient descent is a technique for minimizing error at each phase of the model 
training procedure. Gradient descent has many variants, and its optimization for 
different learning issues has received a lot of attention. If you select this choice 
for the Solution method, you can control the step size, learning rate, and other 
parameters. This choice also allows you to use an inclusive variable path.

  In the second case, because there is no relationship between the algorithms in the two 
tools, it was chosen to show which one gives the best results in both cases. In terms of 
Azure's use of CoD, they are as follows: 
_ Boosted Decision Tree Regression: 0.992114 
_ Decision Forest Regression: 0. 983914 

15 

 
 
    
 
 
 
while in PYTHON using MSE metric the best result given by: 
_ Ridge regression: 0.00002 
_ deep neural network:0.0028 
Both  programming tools  guarantee  good accuracy, though the Azure ML tool is  the 
most accurate and has a faster process. 

9.  Efficiency evaluation between Azure ML and Python tools  

  The research presented in this paper creates a new generation of comparing ML tools 
rather than only algorithms/techniques. To the best of our knowledge, there has never 
been a comparison  of tool  performance in  the field  of MC. Regular tool testing can 
provide  useful  information  to  the  end-user  community,  helping  them  to  make  more 
informed platform decisions. In Table 7 the comparison between Azure ML and Python 
tool are presented.

   Due to the use of ready-made analysis units provided by Azure ML, the complexity 
of project development (detection and modeling of the MC received signal) has been 
significantly reduced when compared to direct Python programming. Also, as a result 
of the performed detection using Azure ML services, the computation time was reduced 
compared to using code-based programming tool as Python when solving the same task.

Conclusions  

  The application of the Azure ML tool in the detection of the MC received signal is 
presented  for  the  first  time.  The  performance  of  ML  supplied  by  two  tools,  Azure 
(visual tool) and Python (textual-code base), on an MC system as a research case, is 
compared. Python is a strong language that allows you to perform complicated tasks 
and data manipulations, while Azure ML allows you to create ML models quickly and 
easily with high accuracy. Because of its cloud nature, Azure ML tends to improve its 
speed over Python-based over time. Among the two solutions we've looked at, Azure 
ML is the one that may be recommended for researchers who are new to the ML field 
as opposed to those who are more experienced. The tool is simply incredibly robust, 
with numerous built-in capabilities and extra functionality that would otherwise need 
the use of third-party libraries. Python is regarded as ideal for skilled users, but Azure 
ML requires no programming or coding knowledge.
