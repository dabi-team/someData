Abstract 

Low attendance levels in medical appointments have been associated with poor health outcomes and 

efficiency problems for service providers. To address this problem, healthcare managers could aim at improving 

attendance levels or minimizing the operational impact of no-shows by adapting resource allocation policies. 

However,  given  the  uncertainty  of  patient  behaviour,  generating  relevant  information  regarding  no-show 

probabilities could support the decision-making process for both approaches. In this context many researchers 

have used multiple regression models to identify patient and appointment characteristics than can be used as 

good predictors for no-show probabilities. This work develops a Decision Support System (DSS) to support the 

implementation of strategies to encourage attendance, for a preventive care program targeted at underserved 

communities in Bogotá, Colombia. Our contribution to literature is threefold.  Firstly, we assess the effectiveness 

of different machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy of regression models. In particular, Random 

Forest  and  Neural  Networks  are  used  to  model  the  problem  accounting  for  non-linearity  and  variable 

interactions.  Secondly, we propose  a novel use of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation  in order to improve the 

explainability of  neural network  predictions  and obtain insights  from the modelling step.  Thirdly, we identify 

variables explaining no-show probabilities in a developing context and study its policy implications and potential 

for improving healthcare access. In addition to quantifying relationships reported in previous studies, we find 

that income and neighbourhood crime statistics affect no-show probabilities. Our results will support patient 

prioritization in a pilot behavioural intervention and will inform appointment planning decisions.

1. Introduction 

High no-show rates are a major issue for health systems. On the one hand, there is a link between low 

attendance  levels  and  poor  health  outcomes:  consequences  include  delays  in  diagnosis  and  initiation  of 

treatment  [1],  increased  premature  mortality  rates  [2]  and  increased  use  of  emergency  services  [3],  among 

others. On the other hand, high no-show rates reduce efficiency for service providers. When a patient fails to 

keep  an  appointment,  it  usually  results  in  a  vacant  slot  that  might  have  been  used  by  another  patient  [4], 

increases cost of care [5] and generates idle time for both physicians and consultancy rooms [6]. Consequently, 

there  is  a  growing  interest  from  the  healthcare  community  in  understanding  the  determinants  of  no-show 

behaviour [7] and minimizing its impact [8].

Two main approaches can be used to deal with no-shows in healthcare settings: to improve attendance 

levels or to minimize impact.  The first  approach is premised on the  idea  that  it is possible  to change patient 

behaviour.  Strategies  such  as  phone  reminders  [9]  and  education  programs  [5]  have  been  successfully 

implemented in different contexts. According to Zebina et al. [1] a key element in this approach is to be able to 

correctly identify the patients that should be targeted with each strategy. In contrast, the underlying assumption 

of the second approach is that such changes in behaviour are unlikely to be achieved, and thus the objective is 

to minimize the impact of no-shows, e.g. by improving the decision-making process regarding resource allocation 

and scheduling [8]. Given the uncertainty of patient behaviour, generating relevant information concerning no-

show probabilities could improve the results of both approaches [10,11]. 

Good estimates of attendance levels have the potential to improve policy evaluation [12], to minimize 

undesired  effects  of  resource  allocation  practices  (such  as  overbooking)  [13]  and  to  inform  identification  of 

influential stakeholders. This is particularly important considering that one of the main objectives is to generate 

information  that  can  be  used  to  improve  management  practices  [14].  However,  there  has  been  very  little 

discussion  in  the  literature  on  the  trade-offs  between  using  ‘black  box’  approaches  (sophisticated  analytical 

methods that would be incomprehensible to most healthcare managers) and more easily interpretable but less 

accurate approaches such as regression models [15].  

The context of the study described in this paper is a primary healthcare program targeted at underserved 

communities in Bogotá, Colombia. Under this program, community workers make home visits to assess health-

risk levels and then, if required, schedule medical appointments. Over the two years 2017-2018 the program 

coverage grew considerably but unfortunately no-show rates for the scheduled medical appointments also grew, 

reaching  levels of 35%  and above. Consequently, there  was  pressure to improve  planning processes  and  use 

resources  more  efficiently.  In  this  work,  we  develop  a  Decision  Support  System  (DSS)  to  support  the 

implementation  of  strategies  to  reduce  no-show  rates  in  this  program.    It  has  been  argued  that  in  complex 

problems with multiple variables and fragmented data, information systems have potential to improve resource 

allocation practices [16] and increase system performance [17]. Hence, the DSS will use routinely collected data 

and Machine Learning (ML) methods to classify patients in three risk categories (low, medium and high) in terms 

of their individual no-show probability. Any intervention to encourage attendance will incur a cost, and hence it 

is more cost-effective to target such interventions at medium and high risk patients.   

We adopt the Design Science Research (DSR) approach of Peffers et al. [25] to describe the development 

of the DSS and address three research questions: 

•  How reliably can routinely collected data on patient and appointment characteristics be used to predict no-

show probabilities? 

•  What is the added value, in terms of AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), of 

using different ML approaches to predict no-show probabilities? 

•  How might insights obtained from these classification models be used in practice to reduce no-shows?

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents recent work in no-show prediction, both in terms 

of the variables used and the modelling approach. Section 3 presents our DSR approach, describing the problem 

definition, the proposed solution, the design, and the demonstration and evaluation phases.  Section 4 presents 

a  descriptive  analysis  of  the  available  data.  Section  5  discusses  the  results  and  how  these  no-show  risk 

classifications could be used in practice.  Finally, Section 6 presents some general reflections. 

2. Related work 

Dantas et al. [7] reviewed studies about no-show prediction in health care, published between 1980 and 

2016, and classified each reference considering the prediction variables, the modelling approach and the context 

of the application. The authors found that, over the last ten years, most studies use Multiple Logistic Regression 

models to quantify relationship between patient characteristics and no-show behaviour. Additionally, despite 

the highest no-show rates in the world being in Africa (43%), South America (28%) and Asia (25%), this problem 

was found to have been mainly studied in developed countries.  

No-show behaviour in primary care appointments has been widely studied [7]. At least two features can 

been  argued  to  explain  the  scientific  interest:  firstly,  since  primary  care  services  are  designed  to  serve  large 

populations, the economic impact of inefficiencies may be greater than in specialized low-coverage services [18]. 

Secondly, primary care patients are highly heterogeneous; thus, there is evidence that supports contradictory 

results regarding the impact that patient characteristics might have on no-show rates [19]. In this section, we 

discuss no-show studies that are related to primary care settings and were published after the review conducted 

by Dantas et al.  [7].  Table 1  presents  the  modelling approach,  sample size  and main variables in each of the 

relevant studies. 

To understand the impact of a particular feature on no-show rates, several studies have been conducted 

using large datasets. McComb et al. [20] find that the impact of lead time on no-show rates is greater among 

patients who cancel and were rescheduled. Ellis, Luther & Jenkins [21] conclude that reduced sleep consequence 

of  the  spring  daylight  savings  change,  increased  no-show  rates,  suggesting  seasonality  on the  patterns.  Both 

studies present ways in which the results could be used to improve scheduling practices. More recently, Wallace 

et al. [3] conclude that patients with lower income and longer travel times to the medical facility are more likely 

to miss their appointments and Parker, Gaugler, Samus and Gliting [22] find lower no-show rates among care 

givers using adult day services. 

A second approach is to identify patient- and practice-related factors that predict no-show probabilities, 

using regression models. Ellis et al. [19] find that age, socioeconomic status and lead times are good predictors 

for repeated non-attendance in Scotland. Analysing data from hospitals in south-west England, French et al. [23] 

conclude that children from higher deprivation areas are more likely to miss their appointments. Goffman et al. 

[24] report that no-show history, age and having multiple appointments scheduled on the same day are good 

predictors for no-show rates among veterans in the United States. Ding et al. [25] discuss the need for designing 

4 

 
different risk models for each medical service and facility in order to improve accuracy. Lastly, Tsai, Lee, Chiang, 

Chen, and Chen [26] find that patient gender, age and no-show history are good predictors in Taiwan. 

In Design Science Research (DSR), knowledge can be descriptive (about the phenomena) or prescriptive 

(about the human-built artefacts) [27]. This paper adds to the existing body of research on no-show behaviour 

not only by its use of ML methods on routine health data (the artefact) but also through its focus on developing 

countries (the phenomena). According to Dantas et al. [7], between 2005 and 2016, most of the research uses 

regression models in order to predict no-show probabilities. However, recent studies explore the use of other 

machine learning techniques. Mohammadi, Wu, Turkan, Toscos and Doebbeling [28] analyse data from electronic 

health records, over a 3-year period, from Community Health Centres in Indianapolis. The authors implement 

logistic regression, neural networks and a Bayes classifier to predict no-show probabilities on a dataset containing 

73,811  appointments.    Unusually,  the  regression  models  and  Bayes  classifier  perform  better  than  neural 

networks,  with  AUROC  values  of  0.81,  0.86  and  0.66,  respectively.  Similarly,  Topuz  et  al.  [15]  assess  the 

effectiveness  of  Bayesian  Belief  Networks  and  propose  an  elastic  net  variable  selection  methodology.  The 

authors  conclude  that  there  is  a  potential  for  machine  learning  methods  to  support  improvements  in 

management  practices  by  providing  accurate  prediction  of  no-show  probabilities.  These  studies  make  no 

mention of interpretability of these black-box models, a topic we tackle in this paper.  

Lastly, while the same modelling methodology can be generalized to different countries, and the same 

independent  variables  have  been  used  across  different  contexts  and  service  settings,  there  is  considerable 

variation between service delivery processes and the demographic and epidemiological population profiles in 

different  countries.  Each  setting  must  be  independently  modelled  to  generate  relevant  information. 

Furthermore, previous studies in developing countries report specific features unique to that setting. Challenges 

such as low  use of technology to centralize  patient  information  [29,30],  income  inequality and job instability 

[31,32],  long  travel  distances  and  poverty  [33],  access  barriers  to  specialized  care  [34]  and  even  low  quality 

expectations  [31]  lead  to  different  interactions  between  patients  and  service  providers.  Consequently,  a 

systematic effort to develop prediction models and customize strategies for developing countries is required, 

and we do so in this work.

In  this  section,  we  present  a  DSR  approach  to  allow  program  managers  to  select  patients  who  will 

participate in different behavioural interventions, by designing an ML-based DSS. Table 2 presents an overview as 

five of the six steps in the DSR methodology proposed by Peffers et al. [35].

3.1 Problem Definition, Scope and Context.  

Broadly speaking, the national healthcare system in Colombia (Sistema General de Seguridad en Salud, 

SGSS)  can  be  understood  as  a  managed  competition  model  with  two  insurance  schemes:  one  contributory, 

covering people who are in formal employment, and one subsidized, covering people unable to pay [36].  Despite 

guaranteeing universal coverage, the SGSS faces constant challenges to improve service quality, increase efficiency 

and eliminate access barriers [12]. Recent studies have shown that these challenges primarily affect patients of 

lower socioeconomic status [37–39]. Therefore, the District Secretary of Health (Secretaría Distrital de Salud, SDS) 

in Bogotá instituted a program to eliminate access barriers affecting low-income patients in the city. The program 

consists of a group of community workers visiting patients, who are sparsely geographically distributed, to assess 

risks, quantify needs and define care routes within the health system. 

The service process of the program can be summarized in three phases. First, patients are identified using 

existing databases from other social programs. Second, community workers make home visits and classify patients 

as  high,  medium  or  low  risk.  Finally,  in  the  third  phase,  a  primary  care  pathway  is  defined  for  each  patient, 

according to their level of health risk of needing a service. For each high or medium risk patient, a first medical 

appointment is scheduled in one or more services. Table 3 presents the objective of the first appointment, in each 

service, as defined by the National Health Authority [40]. At the end of this phase, the barrier is considered to be 

overcome, and the patient is expected to start treatment using the services of the relevant insurance scheme. The 

city  is  divided  into  four  clusters  providing  health  services  and,  for  each  cluster,  a  team  is  in  charge  of  the 

operational decisions of the program.

To assess health status. 

The SDS has defined three performance indicators to assess the operation of the program.  

(i) 

The percentage of effective visits, i.e. where the patient was physically present at the registered address 

at the time of the visit, and the community worker was able to assess them and make a risk classification.   

(ii) 

The percentage of appointments given within a target lead time.  The designated health centre may not 

have  the  capacity  to  treat  the  patient  within  the  required  time  limit,  and  in  such  cases  the  earliest 

appointment is given.  

(iii) 

The percentage of attendance at appointments (i.e., the percentage of no-shows).  These patients might 

enter the health system later via emergency departments due to complications of the identified risks.  

By  the  end  of  2018,  program  managers  faced  challenges  with  indicators  (ii)  and  (iii).  Only  30%  of 

appointments met lead time targets and no-show rates reached levels of 35% in some services.  

3.2 The proposed solution  

In this context, different interventions could be used to modify patient behaviour and improve program 

performance. Phone reminders [41,42], education [5] and engagement programs [43], among others, have shown 

positive impact in decreasing no-show rates in different service contexts. However, such interventions are most 

cost-effective when patients are classified according to their no-show risk [5,9]. Therefore, SDS has identified the 

need  to  divide  patients  into  three  groups.  Group  A  will  contain  30%  of  the  patients,  due  to  economic  and 

operational constraints, no additional action will be implemented for them. For Group B, 40% of patients, lower-

cost technology-based interventions such as SMS reminders will be evaluated. Group C will contain the remaining 

30% of patients. For these, personalized interventions such as engagement or education programs will be designed 

to improve attendance levels.  

It  has  been  argued  that  by  introducing  decision  support  tools,  organizations  can  encourage  reasoned 

thinking, reduce bias and improve decision quality [44]. Therefore, in this paper, we design a DSS to allow program 

managers  to  select  patients  who  will  participate  in  different  behavioural  interventions.  Additionally,  when 

adopting a DSR approach, there is a need to explicitly formulate a set of statements describing the goal, and the 

8 

 
 
means to achieve it. These prescriptive statements are called design principles and are a distinctive characteristic 

of design knowledge [45]. After conducting a series of meetings with program managers at SDS and reviewing 

research  papers  dealing  with  no-show  behaviour  for  healthcare  appointments,  Table  4  presents  the  resulting 

components of our design principle using the schema proposed by Gregor et al. [45]. Within this strategy, the 

success  of  a  set  of  interventions  relies  on  the  quality  of  the  classification.  Then,  we  define  two  performance 

indicators that describe the accuracy. The first is the coverage, defined as the percentage of no-show patients that 

end up classified in Group C, and the second is the risk, defined as the percentage of such patients that end up 

classified in Group A.  A good classification will have high coverage and low risk.  In contrast, a random classification 

would have both coverage and risk equal to 30%.

Behavioural interventions are most cost-effective when patients are classified 
according to their no-show risk. 

3.3 Design and development: the tested modelling approaches  

The first step in the process is the quantification of linear relationships between variables and no-show 

probabilities. Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation is widely used to that end. However, Tibshirani [46] analyses 

two major drawbacks of OLS: accuracy and interpretation. Since OLS estimates have large variance, setting some 

coefficients  to  zero  contributes  to  overcoming  both  limitations.  Therefore,  Tibshirani  proposes  the  LASSO 

regression model, which minimizes the residual sum of squares and ensures that the sum of the absolute value of 

the coefficients is less than some chosen value. Recent applications of this model include forecasting  [47] and 

classification problems [48]. We have used Scikit-Learn’s logistic regression CV implementation, setting the alpha 

value to 0 so as not to not use ridge regression, and all other parameters have been left at their default values 

[49]. Additionally, we perform a parametric analysis on the penalty constant of the model. For each service, thirty 

values are tested (10 values for each of the following three intervals: (0-0.1], (0.1-1], (1-10]) selecting the constant 

under which the AUROC is stable (i.e. its improvement is marginal) and the prediction depends on the minimum 

number of variables. Then, for each input variable, we interpret the average coefficients of a 10-by-10 CV. These 

results are used to inform feature selection for both the RF and the NN.  

Although  logistic  regression  (LR)  models  are  highly  interpretable  (i.e.  understandable  by  non-experts), 

they may not be useful in contexts where the relationships between variables are nonlinear [50]. For those cases, 

tree-based ensemble algorithms have shown good performance and modelling flexibility [51]. Tree classifiers split 

9 

 
 
the data set according to a criterion maximizing separation; the result is a tree-like structure [52]. An ensemble of 

tree predictors, where each tree depends on the values of a random sample of both cases and variables, is called 

a Random Forest [53]. For classification problems, RFs help to overcome the risk of overfitting, are less sensitive 

to outliers, and eliminate the need of pruning [54]. It is been argued that the use of oversampling techniques could 

lead  to  overly  optimistic  prediction  results  [55].  Therefore,  in  order  to  deal  with  an  unbalanced  data  set,  we 

decided  to  use  weight  class  balancing.  Table  5  provides  detailed  information  of  the  parameters  optimization 

process for the RF using Scikit Learn’s GridSearchCV function [49].

Lastly, NNs are widely recognized for their capability to model complex statistical interactions between 

variables  [56,57].  An  NN  is  a  system of  interconnected  neurons,  organized  by  independent  layers,  inspired  by 

biological nervous functioning  [58]. Each neuron accepts a number of weighted inputs  and processes  them to 

produce an output [59]. The weights of the network connections measure the potential amount of the knowledge 

of  the  network  [60].  Therefore,  a  training  phase  is  needed  in  which  the  NN  adapts  the  weights  through 

minimization of the error between actual and estimated outputs [58].  

NNs have been shown to be highly accurate for classification problems. However, the major drawback is 

that they are considered black-box models [52]. Their nested non-linear structure makes it difficult to understand 

what  information  in  the  input  data  makes  them  arrive  at  their  decisions  [61].  Recently,  Layer-wise  Relevance 

Propagation  (LRP)  has  been  proposed  as  a  general  solution  to  the  problem  of  understanding  classification 

decisions [62]. The algorithm relies on a conservation principle to propagate the prediction back throughout the 

network, ensuring the network output is fully redistributed through the layers of the NN back to the input variables 

[63]. The main idea is to understand which input variables contribute to a positive or negative classification result 

[62]. Recent applications of LRP include sentiment analysis [64] and image classification [65]. However, to the best 

of our knowledge, this explainable approach has not been used in the prediction of no-show probabilities. This is 

particularly relevant in our case, since lack of explainability in decision support systems can lead to both practical 

and ethical issues [66]. 

According to Guo and Berkhahm [67], the continuous nature of NNs limits their applicability to categorical 

variables.  Although  one-hot  encoding  is  a  popular  approach  to  overcome  such  limitations,  it  can  require  an 

unrealistic amount of computational resource, increase variance and ignore informative relationships between 

10 

 
 
variables. To deal with this problem, Guo and Berkhahm [67] apply the logic used in natural language processing 

and design an entity embedding method for categorical variables. The idea is to map discrete values to a multi-

dimensional  space  where  values  with  a  similar  function  output  are  close  to  each  other.  Since  the  new 

representation  increases  the  continuity  of  the  data,  it  speeds  up  the  training  process  and  exploits  intrinsic 

properties of categorical variables. For this work, both one-hot encoding and categorical embeddings are tested. 

Therefore, we implement an NN with one hidden layer and use heat maps produced by LRP to identify features 

supporting the classifier’s decision for or against a specific class [64]. Table 6 provides basic information regarding 

parameters optimization using Scikit Learn’s GridSearchCV function [49].  All other parameters have been left at 

their default values.

3.4 Demonstration and Evaluation   

Models performance was assessed using the AUROC score.  From the available database, we randomly 

generated  training  (70%)  and  test  (30%)  sets.  In  the  demonstration  phase,  a  10-fold  Cross  Validation  process 

repeated 10 times (10-by-10 CV) was carried out using the training set. In the evaluation phase, we used the test 

set  to  assess  the  quality  of  the  results  and  discuss  the  practical  implications  of  increased  accuracy  when 

implementing interventions to reduce no-shows. A public version of the experimentation code and a randomly 

generated  database  are  available  [68].  Different  patients  may  be  selected  for  targeting  according  to  which 

classification algorithm is used. As discussed in Section 3.2, we use two measures to assess the quality of a given 

classification, coverage and risk. Therefore, with this evaluation approach, we aim at quantifying the potential 

impact of using our DSS. 

4. Data collection and Initial Analyses 

We analyse data from the South West cluster of the city. Forty-nine medical facilities offering primary care 

are  located within  this cluster.  Four  services:  Oral  Health  (OH),  Growth  and Development  (G&D), Young  Adult 

Program (YAP) and Senior Program (SP), are studied as these cover 75% of scheduled appointments during 2017 

and 2018. In many scoring models, segmentation of discrete variables results in more stable and parsimonious 

models [69], so we have used decision trees to classify these categorical variables coarsely (for age and lead time) 

and one-hot encoding to represent them in the models. Table 7 presents a list of patient and appointment-level 

variables, their descriptions and the Cramer’s V correlation coefficient with the outcome (show or no-show).

Our analysis also uses publicly available information relating to two of the above variables. First, using 

data  from  the  National  Administrative  Department  of  Statistics  (Departamento  Administrativo  Nacional  de 

Estadística, DANE), we classify the zone in which each patient lives as low-income if 50% or more of its population 

belongs to the lowest two income strata: otherwise, it is classified as medium-income. We also use data provided 

by the National Police Office [70] on reported criminal events affecting individual citizens since 2015  to determine 

the sociodemographic context of each healthcare facility.  

Table  8  summarizes  basic  information  on  53,311  scheduled  appointments  during  these  two  years, 

including the outcome (show or no-show). Oral Health has the greatest number of appointments (22,613, 42%) 

and Growth and Development the least, at 14%. No-show rates range from 21% to 39% for each service. At an 

aggregate level, there is no difference in gender between the no-show rates, but in Oral Health and Young Adult 

Program more females than males keep their appointments. With respect to age, the highest no-show rates are 

between 20 and 40 years and the lowest are among children under 10 years and adults over 50. It is also possible 

to see that smaller lead times yield lower no-show rates. The only exception to this behaviour is in Senior Program 

where no-show rates are slightly lower for appointments assigned more than 60 days in advance. Finally, Figure 1 

shows the attendance levels, for each service, presented by day of the week and month of the year. While, on 

average,  92%  of  the  patients  keep  their  appointments  on  Sunday,  this  indicator  decreases  to  69%  on  Fridays. 

Attendance levels range from 58% to 82%, for each month, and its behaviour changes across the four services.

5. Results and discussion 

We present the results organized in three sections. Firstly, we quantify the impact of each variable in 

the LASSO regression model on the no-show probability, and analyse the average coefficients obtained by a 

10-by-10 cross validation process.  Next, we quantify the added value of using RF and NN and compare the 

four modelling alternatives using the AUROC score. Finally, we analyse the impact of using these results as a 

decision  support  system  and  quantify  changes  in  coverage  and  risk  of  an  intervention  when  accuracy  of 

prediction models increases.  

5.1 LASSO regression model: variables affecting no-show probabilities 

Females are more likely to keep their appointments except for SP (odds ratio OH: 1.03, G&D: 1.01, 

YAP: 1.08 and SP: 0.95). On the one hand, this result is highly context-dependent. Whereas some studies have 

reached the same conclusion [71,72], others have reported that males have lower no-show rates [19,73,74], 

or  concluded  that  gender  does  not  have  impact  in  no-show  probabilities  [75,76].  On  the  other  hand,  in 

developing countries it has been argued that, among socio-economically disadvantaged females, high no-show 

rates might be related to a lack of support from social networks and their responsibilities as caregivers [77–

79]. This might explain the result for SP. In Bogotá it is common to find that women older than 60 years take 

care of their grandchildren while the parents work. 

No-show probabilities change with the age of the patient. Figure 2 shows odds ratios (OR) for each 

age range in the four services. Since four models were run, one for each service, the reference values (OR = 1) 

must be independently interpreted. Firstly, in OH, patients between 22 and 33 years have the highest no-show 

probability (OR = 0.72) and it is not possible to identify any age range in which patients have particularly low 

no-show rates. Secondly, in G&D (between 0 and 13 years) and YAP (between 14 and 44 years), older patients 

are  more  likely  to  miss  their  appointments.  This  result  is  consistent  with  previously  reported  findings  in 

primary care and paediatrics settings [20,73,76]. Finally, age seems to have less impact among SP patients.  

Figure 2 Odds ratio for each range of age 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is a relationship between the estimated income of the zone in which the patient lives and the 

no-show probability. In OH, 67% of zones with OR lower than one (i.e. higher no-show probabilities), are low-

income zones. Additionally, 63% of zones with lower no-show probabilities have middle-income levels. This 

result might be associated with the patient’s perception of oral health needs. Wallace et al. [80] found that, 

among low-income populations, dental care is perceived as desirable but more as a luxury than a necessity. 

The opposite scenario was found in SP: 75% of the zones in which OR is less than one and 25% of the zones 

with OR greater than one, have medium-income levels. Finally, for G&D and YAP, low-income zones represent 

the majority of both low and high no-show probability groups. 

As expected, longer lead times increase no-show probabilities. Similar results have been reported in 

primary care settings [19,20], and paediatric clinics [15].  As can be seen in Figure 3 for G&D and YAP, patients 

who are scheduled for appointments with lead times between 8 and 10 days are more likely to attend. Given 

the  age  of  patients  in  these  services,  a  companion  (parent  or  carer)  is  often  required  to  attend  the 

appointment.  Consequently,  non-attendance  may  be  due  to  challenges  in  coordinating  these  logistical 

aspects. On the other hand, the best attendance rates in OH occur when the lead-time ranges from 0 and 10 

days, and the probability of no-shows reaches its maximum value after 15 days. Finally, in older patients, the 

probability of attendance changes less with respect to lead time. These results  demonstrate the non-linear 

nature of no-shows and support the use of analytical techniques for scheduling appointments.

Figure 3 Odds ratio for each service when lead time is varied 

We  also  find  the  date  of  the  appointment  affects  the  no-show  probability.  Previous  studies  have 

reported  seasonal  behaviours  through  the  year  [71,73]  or  variations  depending  on  the  day  of  the  week 

[28,81,82]. Table 9 shows the OR variations, for the four services, in each month of the year and each day of 

the week. As can be seen, in YAP the probability of no-show changes slightly in January, March and October. 

However, for the other months of the year and for all the days of the week, it remains constant. On the other 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hand, the service with the most changes throughout the year is SP with odds ratio varying between 0.61 and 

1.22. This result is interesting because no-show probabilities show low sensitivity to factors such as age, area 

and lead-time in this service. The months of March, November and December seem to have higher levels of 

risk of no show. January, February and October have better behaviour. Regarding the days of the week, the 

best attendance levels are seen during the weekend. 

Finally, we observe that there is a relationship between neighbourhood crime statistics and no-show 

probabilities.  The  four  healthcare  facilities  with  OR  lower  than  one,  across  the  four  services,  are  in 

neighbourhoods with the highest number of incidents. Similarly, out of 49 facilities used in the program only 

two have OR greater than one, across all four services. These facilities are in neighbourhoods with the lowest 

incidence of crime in their respective districts.

Figure 4 presents the 15 variables with the greatest impact on no-show probabilities in each service. 

Firstly, attendance levels are higher on Saturdays (G&D) and Sundays (OH, YAP and SP). This result can be used 

to inform tactical decisions regarding the number of appointments that should be made available throughout 

the  planning  horizon.  Secondly,  ensuring  reasonable  lead  times  can  affect  utilization  levels.  For  the  four 

services, it is possible to identify a maximum lead time that can be set as an objective in the scheduling process. 

Lastly,  some  months and  facilities  have  relatively  high  no-show  rates.  This  information  can  be  used  in the 

design  of  overbooking  policies,  since  better  estimates  of  no-show  probabilities  would  help  to  reduce  the 

undesirable side effects of this practice.

5.2 The added value of using other modelling approaches 

Figure 5 presents the AUROC performance of the four models. Each point in the graph represents the 

average and standard deviation of the AUROC in a repetition of 10-by-10 cross-validation. For all four services, 

the NN model has better average performance. The difference between RF and LR may suggest that the non-

linear component of the relationship between the variables is not very strong, but still significant. Additionally, 

the  average  AUROC  of  both  NN  models  indicates  that  variable  interaction  can  be  successfully  modelled 

without using categorical embedding. Despite having low standard deviations, the amount of available data 

might  not  be  sufficient  to  generate  robust  embeddings,  and  the  disadvantage  of  increased  variance  is 

outweighed by better bias estimation with the increased number of dummy variables. Therefore, in our further 

analysis we consider only the NN with one-hot encoding.

In this section we analyse the implications of using our DSS to select patients and implement targeted 

interventions.  As discussed in Section 3,  SDS  have specified that  the  developed DSS should  allow  program 

managers to divide patients into three groups. Group A will contain the 30% of patients estimated to have 

lowest  no-show  risk.  Group  B,  the  40%  of  patients  with  intermediate  risk  and  Group  C  will  contain  the 

remaining 30% of patients with the highest no-show probabilities. From the machine learning perspective, this 

means that two cut-off points are required. This process is called cut-off point tuning and is based on ROC 

performance measures [83].  

Table 10 presents the coverage and risk for each service and for three models. As can be seen, in G&D, 

an intervention for 30% of patients could cover 80% of the no-shows, if the prediction of the NN is used. This 

percentage would decrease to 64% or 41% using RF or LR. This result is consistent across the four services. The 

average improvement in coverage using NN is 14% with respect to RF and 62% with respect to LR. Lastly, the 

risk of not implementing any action among patients with low no-show risk can be quantified. Using the NN 

classification, these  patients  represent  between 2% and 3% of  no-shows. On the  other hand, using the RF 

prediction the highest risk is in OH and YAP where 9% of the no-shows are classified in group A. Finally, using 

logistic regression, the risk varies between 17% and 21%.

Despite the high accuracy of the NN prediction (i.e. risk of 2.25% and average coverage around 72%), 

using NN results might be challenging. It has been argued that decision makers need to understand the reasons 

underpinning a prediction in order to trust the results [84,85].  Consequently, in an attempt to explain the 

results  of  the  NN,  we  implement  LRP  [62].  As  a  result,  the  importance  of  each  of  the  variables  in  the 

classification of a patient in each category is obtained. According to Yang, Tresp, Wuderle and Fasching [65], 

one of the advantages of this technique, compared with sensitivity analysis, is the interpretability of the signs 

(and absolute values) of the weights. For example, when the weight is large and positive, the variable strongly 

supports the classification chosen by the NN, whereas if the weight is small and negative, the variable weakly 

suggests the opposite classification.  

Figure 6 illustrates the results obtained for ten G&D patients. A column represents a patient, and the 

column  heading  the  no-show  probability.  The  blue  cells  represent  positive  coefficients  and  the  red  cells 

negative  ones,  shaded  by  the  magnitude  of  the  weight.  Only  those  variables  with  at  least  one  non-zero 

coefficient are shown for this group of patients. Our NN predicts that the first patient will not show up for his 

appointment  (95%  of  no-show  probability).  The  main  reason  for  this  conclusion  is  the  month  of  the 

19 

 
 
appointment,  but  lead  time  and  age  also  support  this  classification.  On  the  other  hand,  the  day  of  the 

appointment, and the zone in which the patient lives support the opposite classification, i.e. that the patient 

would in fact attend. Moreover, the fact that the same variables have both positive and negative coefficients 

(regardless of the no-show probabilities) implies that the network is learning about the context. It means that 

the NN learns that it is not enough to know the gender of a patient to decide in which category they should 

be classified. For example, when running a regression model including the interaction of gender with age and 

day of the week, it is possible to observe slightly different results from those reported by the model without 

interaction.  For  G&D  we  found  that  females  are  more  likely  to  miss  appointments  on  Saturdays  and 

Wednesdays (O.R. = 0.75 and 0.94).

This  interpretation  procedure  can  be  used  for  any  data-driven  machine  learning  model,  giving 

interesting insights which have real applications for decision support systems. The focus of the implementation 

of these processes must be on actionable combinations of parameters: if a relation between several variables 

is found (such as gender and day of the week), then an action can be performed for those specific groups. The 

use of such interpretability tools allows effects like these to be observed and revealed, which would otherwise 

be neglected.  

6. Concluding remarks 

This work has been developed with the active involvement of SDS. We conducted several workshops 

with  program  managers,  operational  analysts  at  the  healthcare  clusters,  and  community  workers.  This 

approach enabled  us  to  develop a more  comprehensive  view  of  the  program, identify  a  champion  for  the 

project within SDS, generate a shared vision of the main challenges and maintain stakeholders’ engagement. 

Therefore,  the  discussion  shifted  from  a  resource  allocation  perspective  to  a  better  understanding  of  the

underlying problem and the identification of restrictions that could prevent the implementation of changes in 

the operation. By the end of the workshops, they concluded that as the program covers a highly heterogenic 

population, more personalized strategies were required to reduce no-show behaviour. In this context, patient 

classification was identified as a key element to ensure the economic feasibility of any intervention strategy. 

Following this process we were able to reach an agreement on an appropriate design principle which captures 

the  knowledge  of  our  stakeholders.  Consequently,  our  DSS  aims  at  leveraging  routinely  collected  data  to 

inform such classification. During the feedback sessions, program managers stressed that they value that the 

results were easy to understand and have the potential to improve service quality.  

In light of the promising results, at the time of writing SDS is starting a pilot intervention to modify 

patient  behaviour.  Using  the  DSS  to  predict  no-show  probabilities  will  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the 

intervention since the NN classifies around 80% of potential no-show cases to Group C, the 30% of patients 

designated  to  receive  the  most  intensive,  personalized,  intervention.  Therefore,  as  stated  in  our  design 

principle, the design of this DSS can be seen as a necessary first step to reduce no-show behaviour in primary 

care and the future development of design knowledge [86]. After an evaluation of the pilot is carried out, a 

web-based tool will be developed to enable models to be used in program operation.  

Our objective is to use routinely collected data to predict no-show probabilities. However, in order to 

inform the discussion, we also use other sources of public information. Two findings are particularly relevant 

in developing country contexts. First, in Oral Health, 67% of zones with OR less than one (i.e. higher no-show 

probabilities), are low-income zones, and 63% of zones with lower no-show probabilities have middle-income 

levels. Second, the four healthcare facilities (out of 49) with OR less than one across all four services are in 

neighbourhoods  with  the  highest  number  of  reported  crime  incidents,  whereas  the  two  facilities  with  OR 

greater  than  one  across  all  four  services  are  in  neighbourhoods  with  the  lowest  crime  incidence  in  their 

respective  districts.  These  exploratory  results  indicate  that  including  socioeconomic  data  could  potentially 

increase understanding of no-show behaviour. Further research is required to evaluate the cost/benefit of 

collecting such data and including these variables in the SDS information system.  

Since this paper presents retrospective analysis of historical data, it is not possible to draw conclusions 

regarding the reasons for no-show  behaviour. Therefore,  the next  step in this research is  a mixed-method 

study  to  understand  and model  patients’  decision-making  processes.  Semi-structured  interviews  are  being 

conducted  among  no-show  patients  in  order  to  learn  from  their  experiences  and  identify  access  barriers. 

Moreover, we are analysing survey data to quantify the relationship between the no-show probability and the 

constructs of a health psychology model.  

Modelling no-show behaviour in primary care settings is an active research area.  The most common 

approach in the literature is multiple regression, but due to its limitations in accuracy, using the results to 

improve management practice can be problematic. Machine learning methods are gaining in popularity but 

21 

 
have the drawback of being a ‘black box’ that managers may not trust. Our research shows the benefits of a 

two-pronged approach to overcome this. Firstly, using LRP to produce a heat map visualisation that makes the 

model results immediately understandable, and secondly, involving stakeholders in every stage of the design 

process. Additionally, despite the highest no-show rates worldwide being in developing countries, the problem 

has  been  mainly  studied  in  North  America  and  the  United  Kingdom  [7].  The  research  presented  here 

contributes to the literature by assessing the effectiveness of machine learning approaches using routine data 

to predict no-show behaviour among low-income patients in a developing country context. 

Throughout this research, we have designed a process to construct a DSS for improving healthcare 

access powered with machine learning models. In general, the first stages of the process are replicable across 

all healthcare systems that wish to develop such a DSS. Steps such as the facilitated formulation of a design 

principle, data collection strategies, data processing steps, and the selection of models to use are  relevant 

issues for every designer facing a similar challenge. Additionally, by using the schema proposed by Gregor et 

al. [45], our design principle also meets the five criteria for reusability: accessibility, importance, novelty, and 

effectiveness [87]. Therefore, we expect that other DSS designers can build from this experience when defining 

intervention groups. We believe that our results could help not only other designers in healthcare settings but 

also  those  dealing  with  limited  resources  in  other  contexts  such  as educational  or social  programs,  where 

prioritization plays a key role in ensuring feasibility.
