ABSTRACT

We present the third and ﬁnal data release of the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program (K2 GAP)
for Campaigns C1-C8 and C10-C18. We provide asteroseismic radius and mass coeﬃcients, κR and
κM , for ∼ 19, 000 red giant stars, which translate directly to radius and mass given a temperature. As
such, K2 GAP DR3 represents the largest asteroseismic sample in the literature to date. K2 GAP DR3
stellar parameters are calibrated to be on an absolute parallactic scale based on Gaia DR2, with red
giant branch and red clump evolutionary state classiﬁcations provided via a machine-learning approach.
Combining these stellar parameters with GALAH DR3 spectroscopy, we determine asteroseismic ages
with precisions of ∼ 20 − 30% and compare age-abundance relations to Galactic chemical evolution
models among both low- and high-α populations for α, light, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements.
We conﬁrm recent indications in the literature of both increased Ba production at late Galactic times,

as well as signiﬁcant contribution to r-process enrichment from prompt sources associated with, e.g.,
core-collapse supernovae. With an eye toward other Galactic archaeology applications, we characterize
K2 GAP DR3 uncertainties and completeness using injection tests, suggesting K2 GAP DR3 is largely
unbiased in mass/age and with uncertainties of 2.9% (stat.) ± 0.1% (syst.) & 6.7% (stat.) ± 0.3% (syst.)
in κR & κM for red giant branch stars and 4.7% (stat.) ± 0.3% (syst.) & 11% (stat.) ± 0.9% (syst.) for
red clump stars. We also identify percent-level asteroseismic systematics, which are likely related to the
time baseline of the underlying data, and which therefore should be considered in TESS asteroseismic
analysis.

1. INTRODUCTION

Studies of Galactic chemical evolution have mostly fo-
cussed on targets in the solar neighborhood, where stars
are relatively easy to observe, and which was the sole
domain, historically, of precise parallaxes, and therefore,
stellar ages (e.g., Nordstr¨om et al. 2004). Because stars
for the most part maintain their birth abundances, stel-
lar abundances and ages can be used to infer the chemi-
cal enrichment history of the Galaxy, providing informa-
tion on the details of contributions to the insterstellar
medium from nucleosynthetic channels like supernovae
and stellar winds.

The local stellar population has been found to have a
bimodal chemical distribution in alpha elements (e.g., O,
Mg, Ca, Si) as seen in [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H]1: there exists
one population of low-α stars with spatial distributions
apparently more conﬁned to the plane of the Galaxy and
with intermediate to young ages, and there exists an-
other population of high-α stars with hotter kinematics;
centrally-concentrated spatial distributions in the disk;
and older ages (e.g., Fuhrmann 1998; Prochaska et al.
2000; Gratton et al. 2000; Bensby et al. 2003; Haywood
et al. 2013). With the understanding that α elements
are produced primarily in core-collapse supernovae (CC-
SNe), with some contributions to the heavier nuclei from
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), whereas iron is mostly
produced in SNe Ia, the low-α population has been in-
terpreted as having mostly contributions from SNe Ia
and the high-α population has been interpreted as hav-
ing mostly contributions from CCSNe (Burbidge et al.
1957; Timmes et al. 1995).

Studies of stellar populations beyond the solar neigh-
borhood have shown that the low-α and high-α pop-
ulations maintain their chemical bimodality, and to a
certain extent, their distinct radial spatial distributions,
with the high-alpha stars more centrally concentrated
(Nidever et al. 2014; Hayden et al. 2015), though not
necessarily intrinsically having a diﬀerent vertical spa-
tial distribution (Hayden et al. 2017). There are also

interesting chemical distinctions among these popula-
tions when looking at non–α-element abundance ra-
tios (e.g., Prochaska et al. 2000; Bensby et al. 2003;
Adibekyan et al. 2012; Weinberg et al. 2019; Griﬃth
et al. 2019; Nissen et al. 2020). Given expectations that
the bimodality is ultimately related to diﬀerent chemi-
cal enrichment histories, it is natural to ask how these
populations evolved, and, in so doing, test understand-
ings of the nucleosynthetic production sites’ yields with
time. Indeed, the underlying origin of these spatial and
chemical distinctions is under debate (e.g., Chiappini
et al. 1997; Sch¨onrich & Binney 2009a,b; Kobayashi &
Nakasato 2011; Minchev et al. 2015; Hayden et al. 2017;
Mackereth et al. 2018; Spitoni et al. 2019; Clarke et al.
2019).

Thanks

to an unprecedented collection of well-
measured stellar kinematics from Gaia (Gaia Collabora-
tion et al. 2016, 2018), and with large spectrocopic sur-
veys like APOGEE (Majewski et al. 2017), GALAH (De
Silva et al. 2015), and LAMOST (Newberg et al. 2012)
providing hundreds of thousands of detailed abundance
measurements probing well beyond the solar vicinity, the
bottleneck to progress on the origin and evolution of the
elements in the Galaxy becomes stellar age.

Stellar composition has historically been used as a
proxy for stellar age, based on the idea that Galactic
enrichment increases with time, with input to the inter-
stellar medium through asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars, SNe Ia, and CCSNe continually injecting metals
over time according to so-called delay-time distributions,
in ratios that themselves depend on time due to the
birth composition of the stars producing the elements
changing (Tinsley 1979; McWilliam 1997). Kinematic
information can also serve as an age proxy, with older
stellar populations experiencing dynamical heating from
discrete merger events (e.g., Grand et al. 2016) as well as
secular processes involving, e.g., spiral arms (Carlberg
& Sellwood 1985; Minchev & Quillen 2006); the cen-
tral bar (Saha et al. 2010; Grand et al. 2016); and giant
molecular clouds (e.g., Spitzer & Schwarzschild 1951).

To make precise statements about the chemical evolu-
tion of the Galaxy, however, requires genuine stellar age
estimates independent of kinematics and abundances
so as to not assume the age-abundance patterns under

question. Work appealing to stellar ages to solve this
conundrum has either made recourse to turnoﬀ stars —
whose ages can be reliably determined through isochrone
matching (Pont & Eyer 2004; Jørgensen & Lindegren
2005; Lin et al. 2019), but which are relatively dim and
therefore probe predominantly local volumes — or to
spectroscopic ages (e.g., Sun et al. 2020; Ness et al.
2016). Although machine learning–based spectroscopic
ages have increased sample sizes to hundreds of thou-
sands, they do not seem to yield reliable for ages > 8 Gyr
(Ting & Rix 2019). Another approach is to make refer-
ence to Galactic stellar population models, and match
a predicted age-color relation to observed colors (e.g.,
Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2019). As we will show here,
such photometric ages — with typical uncertainties of
30-50% — are signiﬁcantly less precise than the 20-30%
K2 asteroseismic age uncertainties we present here.

Because asteroseismic ages do not assume either an
age-kinematics relation or age-metallicity relation, they
can provide interesting constraints on Galactic chemi-
cal evolution. Indeed, asteroseismic ages have supported
literature estimates that the two α populations have dif-
ferent age distributions (e.g., Silva Aguirre et al. 2018;
Miglio et al. 2021), while complicating the understand-
ing that the high-α population is uniformly old (Chi-
appini et al. 2015; Anders et al. 2017; Warﬁeld et al.
2021). These studies have mostly been limited to aster-
oseismic data from the Kepler mission (Borucki et al.
2008), which probes a single, 100 sq. deg. ﬁeld of
view at roughly ﬁxed Galactic radius corresponding to
that of the Sun. With the extended Kepler mission,
K2 (Howell et al. 2014), has come access to regions of
the sky across the ecliptic, and exploratory work based
on data from four K2 campaigns has shown promise for
better understanding the α bimodality (Rendle et al.
2019; Warﬁeld et al. 2021). The K2 Galatic Archaeol-
ogy Program (GAP; Stello et al. 2015) takes advantage
oﬀ this opportunity, targeting red giant stars with the
express intent of investigating the chemical evolution of
the Galaxy beyond the solar vicinity using asteroseismic
ages.

In this paper, we describe the ﬁnal data release of K2
GAP, which combines red giant asteroseismic data from
Campaign 1 (C1) from K2 GAP DR1 (Stello et al. 2017)
and data from C4, C6, & C7 from K2 GAP DR2 (Zinn
et al. 2020) with results from the remaining K2 cam-
paigns. In K2 GAP Data Release 3 (DR3), we improve
upon K2 GAP DR2 by verifying the accuracy and preci-
sion of asteroseismology with an injection test exercise,
and calibrate our results against Gaia DR2 (Gaia Col-

laboration et al. 2018) radii2. Finally, we derive ages
based on these calibrated asteroseismic masses in or-
der to compare abundance enrichment histories of low-
and high-α populations with Galactic chemical evolu-
tion models from Kobayashi et al. (2020a).

2. DATA

2.1. Asteroseismic data

In this data release, we add asteroseismic data from
C2, C3, C5, C8, and C10-C18 to results from C1 from
K2 GAP DR1 (Stello et al. 2017) and C4, C6, & C7 from
K2 GAP DR2 (Zinn et al. 2020). In what follows, we
describe the procedure to derive the asteroseismic values
for stars in these new campaigns, and we also describe
how the results from all of the campaigns are combined
together.

The majority of K2 GAP targets were chosen to sat-
isfy simple color and magnitude cuts, with a minority
chosen based on surface gravity selections from spec-
troscopic surveys (APOGEE [Majewski et al. 2010],
SEGUE [Yanny et al. 2009]; or RAVE [Steinmetz et al.
2006]). Most of the campaigns have targets that are
chosen based on a J − Ks > 0.5 color cut and a magni-
tude cut of 9 (cid:46) V (cid:46) 15, where the visual magnitude is
computed from 2MASS photometry according to

V ≈ Ks + 2((J − Ks) + 0.14) + 0.256e2(J−Ks),

which is a relation introduced by (De Silva et al. 2015).
The targets were prioritized for the most part by ranking
targets in order of brightest to faintest visual magnitude,
with higher priority given to targets selected based on
spectroscopy.

The majority of the targeted stars were observed by
K2, and follow the target selection functions, with a few
exceptions. Notably, the priorities of C7 targets were
mistakenly reversed during the Kepler oﬃce target list
consolidation. For details of the eﬀects of this on the
C7 selection function, see Zinn et al. (2020) and Sharma
et al. (2019); the selection functions for all the cam-
paigns are described in S. Sharma et al., submitted. In
addition, module 4 failed while taking data in C10. We
therefore exclude data from this module in C10 because
of the short duration of data collection before the failure;
modules 3 and 7 had already failed by the time the K2

2 Here and throughout the text, when we mention Gaia radii, we
refer to radii we calculate using APOGEE spectroscopy and Gaia
parallaxes, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. These radii
are distinct from the radius val values provided as part of Gaia
DR2; the latter are not as accurate as we require here because
they do not account for extinction, and assume inhomogeneous
temperatures. See §4 for details.

mission began, and so there are no data for these mod-
ules in K2 GAP. These missing modules can be seen in
the K2 GAP DR3 footprint shown in Figure 1.

There are known systematics in the K2 light curves
that require special processing beyond the raw light
In particular, the
curves produced by the K2 oﬃce.
K2 satellite repositioned itself every ∼6 hours to main-
tain pointing following the partial failure of its gyro-
scope system. These thruster ﬁrings induce trends in
the light curves that would hinder asteroseismic analy-
sis. The light curves used in our analysis were therefore
detrended from the raw K2 data using the EVEREST
pipeline (Luger et al. 2018) for all observed K2 GAP
target stars except C1, for which we used the K2SFF
pipeline (Vanderburg & Johnson 2014), and targets clas-
siﬁed as extended in the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog
(EPIC; Huber et al. 2016), which were not processed by
EVEREST. C10 suﬀered a failure of module 4 shortly
into the start of the campaign, and so we did not use
data from targets on module 4. C11 was separated into
two parts due to a roll angle correction such that some
stars had light curves only for one part of the campaign;
we combined the light curves of the two parts when avail-
able for the same target. C18 lasted about 50d due
to the spacecraft running low on fuel, and has corre-
spondingly reduced quality data. C19 only had about a
week’s worth of data with pointing comparable to pre-
vious campaigns, and, as such, we do not consider the
data from C19 in this data release.

asteroseismic variability using a boxcar high-pass ﬁlter
with a width of 4 days, and performed sigma-clipping
to reject ﬂux values more than 4-σ discrepant. For the
campaigns new to this data release, we additionally
regularized the spectral window function by inpainting
any gaps in the light curves according to the algorithm
of Garc´ıa et al. (2014) and Pires et al. (2015).

2.2. Spectroscopic data

APOGEE DR16 (Ahumada et al. 2020) spectroscopic
data are used for calibrating the asteroseismic data
(§4). APOGEE DR16 is part of SDSS-IV (Blanton
et al. 2017), and which is described in Ahumada et al.
(2020). APOGEE observes in the H-band using the
high-resolution (R ∼ 22, 500) APOGEE spectrograph
(Wilson et al. 2019) mounted on the Sloan Foundation
2.5-m telescope (Gunn et al. 2006) at Apache Point Ob-
servatory. APOGEE observes about half of its targets
in the disc, with Galactic latitude, b ≤ 16◦, with dedi-
cated selection of the bulge, halo, and special programs
comprising the rest of its observing allotment. Tar-
gets are selected according to color-magnitude cuts of

J − Ks ≥ 0.5 and 7 (cid:46) H (cid:46) 14, across the sky (Za-
sowski et al. 2013, 2017). The data are reduced accord-
ing to Nidever et al. (2015), using the APOGEE Stellar
Parameters and Chemical Abundances Pipeline, (ASP-
CAP; Holtzman et al. 2015; Garc´ıa P´erez et al. 2016).
The ﬁnal stellar parameter calibration and validation
process is discussed by Holtzman et al. (2018).

GALAH data are used for our analysis of age-
abundance patterns (§5). GALAH is an optical spectro-
scopic survey targeting stars in the Galactic disc with
12 < V < 14 and |b| > 10◦ (Martell et al. 2017). The
survey operates from the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Tele-
scope at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia, using
the HERMES multi-object spectrograph (Sheinis et al.
2014). HERMES’s high resolution (R ∼ 28, 000) spec-
tra are reduced according to the procedure documented
in Kos et al. (2017). GALAH DR2 presented spectro-
scopic parameters from The Cannon (Ness et al. 2015),
trained on a subset of ∼ 11, 000 stars (Buder et al. 2018;
Heiter et al. 2015) using Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME;
Valenti & Piskunov 1996; Piskunov & Valenti 2017). In
this work, we use abundances from GALAH DR3, which
improves upon GALAH DR2 by deriving stellar param-
eters and abundances for all stars directly through the
spectroscopic analysis code SME, which performs on-
the-ﬂy spectrum synthesis calculations; this reduces po-
tential bias from selection eﬀects in the Cannon training
process (e.g., Holtzman et al. 2018). The SME analy-
sis code utilises grids of pre-computed non-LTE depar-
ture coeﬃcients for thirteen chemical elements; these
grids and the models they are based on are presented
by Amarsi et al. (2020; and references therein), and are
publicly available (Amarsi 2020).

3. METHODS

3.1. Asteroseismic radius and mass scaling relations

Given the large sample size of the K2 GAP targets,
it is not feasible to ﬁt individual modes for each star
Instead, we condense
to determine mass and radius.
the modes’ information to two quantities, which can be
measured relatively straightforwardly and which are re-
lated to the mass and radius of a star through so-called
scaling relations.

The ﬁrst of these quantities, the frequency at maxi-
mum acoustic power, νmax, is thought to be related to
the acoustic cutoﬀ frequency, and therefore with the sur-
face gravity of the star (Brown et al. 1991; Kjeldsen &
Bedding 1995; Chaplin et al. 2008; Belkacem et al. 2011).
Assuming this relation holds homologously across evolu-
tionary state, this implies a scaling relation of the form

The second quantity of interest, the large frequency
separation, ∆ν, describes the frequency diﬀerence be-
tween modes of consecutive radial order that share the
same degree. A second, independent scaling relation
relates ∆ν to the average stellar density (Ulrich 1986;
Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995)

(2)

The latter scaling relation is well-understood theoret-
ically, and is valid, strictly speaking, in the limit of large
radial order. However, given a stellar structure model,
one can compute the expected ∆ν at the observed radial
order as well as a ∆ν in the limit of large radial order,
and therefore derive a correction factor, f∆ν, to trans-
late the observed ∆ν to the large radial order ∆ν that
enters into Equation 2 (e.g., White et al. 2011; Sharma
et al. 2016). We therefore use a modiﬁed version of
Equation 2:

Note that these corrections do not take into account
frequency shifts due to the approximations of adiabatic
thermal structures and mixing length theory widely used
in stellar evolution models (e.g., Jørgensen et al. 2020,
2021). However, such considerations are secondary ad-
justments to f∆ν, given the empirical success of f∆ν in
producing agreement of asteroseismic radii and masses
with independent estimates (e.g., Huber et al. 2017; Bro-
gaard et al. 2018; Zinn et al. 2019b). We opt to use the
f∆ν corrections from Sharma et al. (2016), which are
computed on a star-by-star basis according to the star’s
properties (e.g., temperature, metallicity, etc.) by inter-
polation in a grid of theoretically computed f∆ν. The
asfgrid code to compute f∆ν values is publicly avail-
able (Sharma et al. 2016; Sharma & Stello 2016)3

In analogy with corrections to the ∆ν scaling relation,
there are observational indications that the νmax scaling
relation of Equation 1 should be modiﬁed to include a
correction to the observed νmax, fνmax (Epstein et al.
2014; Yıldız et al. 2016; Huber et al. 2017; Viani et al.
2017; Kallinger et al. 2018). For this reason, we use a
modiﬁed νmax scaling relation:

Although progress is being made to make robust the-
oretical predictions of νmax (e.g., Belkacem et al. 2013;
Zhao et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2020), it cannot yet be
computed based on ﬁrst principles to the precision re-
quired to be useful, as can be done for ∆ν. We therefore
make empirical estimates of fνmax in §4 for RGB and RC
stars, which, in practice, are scalar values such that we
can think of fνmax as indistinguishable from a modiﬁed
νmax,(cid:12).

The solar reference values in Equations 3 & 4 should,
in theory, be measured using the same analysis as one
would measure νmax and ∆ν. Therefore, each pipeline
has diﬀerent solar reference values, which are listed in
Table 1. We assume here a solar temperature of Teﬀ,(cid:12) =
5772K (Mamajek et al. 2015).

do not have spectroscopic temperature estimates, we re-
port, as we did in K2 GAP DR2, the radius and mass
coeﬃcients, κR and κM . This allows the user to compute
radii and masses using consistent temperature scales in

the context of their work. We also provide the f∆ν
we compute according to Sharma et al. (2016) in Ta-
ble 2, though to maintain complete consistency, users
should re-compute these values using the same temper-
ature scale as they do to convert radius and mass co-
eﬃcients into radii and masses. As a reference, should
there be a 100K discrepancy in the EPIC temperatures
used to compute f∆ν as we do here and the user’s tem-
peratures, a 1% systematic would be introduced into
f∆ν. Users may generate their own f∆ν values using the
publicly-available asfgrid code.

3.2. Derived asteroseismic parameters

We make use of the same pipelines as the previous
K2 GAP data releases to extract these aforementioned
asteroseimsic quantities, νmax and ∆ν, from K2 light
curves: A2Z (Mathur et al. 2010); BAM (Zinn et al.
2019c); BHM (Hekker et al. 2010); CAN (Kallinger et al.
2010, 2016); COR (Mosser & Appourchaux 2009; Mosser
et al. 2010); and SYD (Huber et al. 2009). The gener-
alized problem that each of these pipelines addresses is
to identify a regular pattern of solar-like oscillations in
the presence of red and white noise. The problem of
detecting solar-like oscillations in K2 data also involves
systematic noise that can mimic solar-like oscillations
(see Stello et al. 2017; Zinn et al. 2019c). Though their
implementations vary, the above asteroseismic pipelines
share common approaches of 1) ﬁtting a model to the
power spectrum to remove the stellar red noise; 2) ﬁt-
ting a Gaussian excess in power above the red noise,
with a mean corresponding to νmax (A2Z, BAM, BHM,
CAN, COR) or heavily smoothing the excess to localize
the frequency of its peak as νmax (SYD); and 3) identi-
fying ∆ν using either individually ﬁtted modes (CAN)
or some version of the autocorrelation function (A2Z,
BAM, BHM, CAN, COR, SYD). For more details on
their implementation and methodology in the context
of K2, please see Stello et al. (2017) and Zinn et al.
(2020).4

We follow the procedure laid out in K2 GAP DR2 to
derive average asteroseismic parameters for each star.
This method is similar to the one adopted for the
APOKASC-2 sample, which is described in Pinson-

4 The following changes were implemented in the SYD pipeline
compared to its description and use in K2 GAP DR2: 1) in ad-
dition to the nominal νmax and ∆ν conﬁdence cuts mentioned
in Zinn et al. (2020), stars are required to fall within the em-
pirical ∆ν–νmax relation from Stello et al. (2009), such that

neault et al. (2018).
In short, we re-scale each of the
pipeline νmax and ∆ν values such that the average val-
ues for the entire sample across all pipelines is the same,
which requires an iterative approach and results in av-
eraged values for each star, denoted (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105).
Three modiﬁcations have been implemented here com-
pared to the methodology described in Zinn et al. (2020).
First, the A2Z ∆ν values are not incorporated into the
(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) due to a signiﬁcant systematic oﬀset from other
pipeline values. Second, for stars that were observed
in more than one campaign, variance-weighted averages
for each pipeline are computed before proceeding, such
that there is only one measurement per star. Third,
whereas previously the sigma-clipping was done at the
end of each iteration, we now allow the average νmax to
converge before performing a 3-σ clipping and continu-
ing the iteration process. For each star with at least
two pipeline values returned, we then take the aver-
age νmax value, (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105), and adopt the scatter in those
νmax values as the uncertainty on νmax, σ(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105). The
same exercise is performed for ∆ν to compute (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105)
and σ(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105). In so doing, we are assuming that the dif-
ferent pipelines have systematic diﬀerences in ∆ν and
νmax measurements that tend to cancel out when av-
eraged together. This exercise is done for RGB and
RC stars separately, based on evolutionary states com-
puted using the machine-learning approach described in
Hon et al. (2017, 2018).
In brief, the machine learn-
ing approach takes advantage of the fact that red giant
branch and red clump stars exhibit diﬀerences in the
observed mode structure (Bedding et al. 2011). These
diﬀerences are detectable by visual inspection, and are
therefore amenable to being learned by machine learn-
ing algorithms. The classiﬁer developed by Hon et al.
(2017, 2018) uses a convolutional neural network — an
architecture optimized for image processing — to learn
characteristic red giant and red clump mode features
present in power spectra rendered as 2D images. In this
work, evolutionary states are assigned arbitrarily at the
initial iteration, and in subsequent iterations, for stars
with a deﬁned (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) and (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105), machine-learning evo-
lutionary states are assigned. The ﬁnal iteration pro-
ceeds with only stars with deﬁned (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) and (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105).
As part of this process, each pipeline has assigned scale
factors, Xνmax, RGB, X∆ν, RGB, Xνmax, RC, and X∆ν, RC
that describe by how much the pipeline-speciﬁc solar ref-
erence value (Table 1) should be multiplied to be put on
the (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) scale for RGB stars and RC stars,
respectively. These modiﬁed solar reference values are
provided in Table 3. Here, we also indicate the anal-
ogous scaling factors from APOKASC-2 (Pinsonneault
et al. 2018), where diﬀerences are a result of slightly

culated using the EPIC temperature in combination with

diﬀerent methodology and due to not working with the
same pipelines: BAM was not a part of the APOKASC-2
analysis. It is also likely that there are signiﬁcant dif-
ferences introduced in the pipeline’s asteroseismic scales
due to the diﬀerence between the time baselines of Ke-
pler and K2, which we discuss in §4.

We provide all the results returned by every pipeline

evolutionary states based on (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) and (cid:104)ν(cid:48)

as evolutionary states based on individual pipeline val-

include the EPIC IDs for stars that had no measured
asteroseismic parameters by any pipeline but that were
targeted as part of K2 GAP so that users may inves-
tigate asteroseismic selection functions as needed; we
quantify K2 GAP DR3 completeness as a function of
mass and radius in §4.1. The K2 GAP DR3 sample that
we refer to in what follows is a subset of the totality of
targeted stars, and consists only of the stars with a valid
(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105). There are 19417 such stars, 18821 of which also
have a valid (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) and therefore (cid:104)κR(cid:105) and (cid:104)κM (cid:105). Stars
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) are assigned an evolution-
with both (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
ary state, resulting in 12978 RGB stars and 5843 RC
stars. The numbers of stars with asteroseismic detec-
tions broken down by campaign and pipeline are listed
in Table 7. The Kiel diagram for the K2 GAP DR3
sample is shown in Figure 2 and its distribution on the
sky is shown in Figure 1; the sample is also shown in
Galactocentric coordinates in Fig. 3.

4. VALIDATION OF ASTEROSEISMIC VALUES IN

K2 GAP DR3

4.1. Injection tests

In the previous section, we detailed the dependence
of asteroseismic results across pipelines. However, there
are likely additional systematics due to the length of the
K2 light curves compared to, e.g., Kepler light curves.
Indeed, Hekker et al. (2012) revealed non-negligible vari-
ations in completeness, precision, and accuracy in red
giant asteroseismic parameters due to the length of the
time series (i.e., the time baseline). In order to test the
completeness, precision, and accuracy of the diﬀerent
asteroseismic modelling pipelines for K2-like data, we
generated synthetic data for which we knew the “true”
νmax and ∆ν from Kepler and performed blind injection
recovery tests.

68th (98th) percentile of the plotted stars. Within these con-
tours, the logarithmic density of stars is indicated according
to the color bar. Dashed circles indicate distances of 1kpc,

tainties calculated according to standard propagation of
uncertainty.5

In K2 GAP DR2, we established that the uncertain-
ties from our averaging process follow χ2 statistics, and
can be described to a good appproximation by fractional
uncertainties that are mostly a function of evolutionary
state. We report in Table 5 the median fractional un-
max(cid:105), (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105), (cid:104)κR(cid:105), and (cid:104)κM (cid:105) for both
certainties in (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
RGB stars and RC stars, and which may be consid-
ered typical of the uncertainties in our sample. We also
include typical fractional uncertainties in these param-
eters from K2 GAP DR2, APOKASC-2 (Pinsonneault
et al. 2018), and another, independent analysis of Kepler
data (Yu et al. 2018). The typical ∆ν uncertainty for K2
GAP DR3 is somewhat larger than it was in K2 GAP
DR2 due to the previously mentioned diﬀerence in how
sigma clipping is performed in the averaging procedure
used in the two data releases. The resulting precisions

tiple observations of the same star across diﬀerent campaigns,
we adopted the evolutionary state from the campaign with the
smallest evolutionary state uncertainty according to the machine
learning approach.

We ﬁrst created a grid in magnitude-νmax space from
the distribution of Kepler stars from APOKASC (Pin-
sonneault et al. 2018); the faint giant sample of Mathur
et al. (2016); and the M-giant sample of Stello et al.
(2014), in order to select Kepler stars evenly across this
parameter space. From each bin, when possible, we
generated K2-like light curves based on 80d segments
of Kepler light curves via two methods. First, we at-
tempted to select from each bin three Kepler stars with
at least ﬁve quarters of data each, from which we cre-
ated 15 synthetic K2 light curves (selecting ﬁve diﬀerent
80d sections from three stars). Second, we attempted to
generate 15 synthetic K2 light curves from 15 diﬀerent
Kepler stars from a single 80d section of each of their
light curves; in practice, not each bin had enough stars
to create 30 synthetic K2 light curves from these two
methods. Each of these synthetic K2 light curves was
created using KASOC v1 Q1-Q14 light curves (Hand-
berg & Lund 2014), linearly interpolating the Kepler
ﬂux onto a cadence of a star in K2 C3 to mimic the
spectral window of actual C3 data and the frequency
resolution of K2. We then increased the white noise level
for each of the synthetic K2 light curves according to the
following procedure. First, the white noise as a function
of magnitude was computed for the entire grid of Ke-
pler stars as well as the 10291 non-GAP C3 targets with
EVEREST long-cadence light curves. The white noise
for each star was computed by taking the standard de-
viation of its light curve ﬁltered to remove variability
slower than ∼ 150µHz. For both of these samples, the
20th percentile of the white noise levels as a function of
magnitude were ﬁtted using third degree polynomials.
Each synthetic K2 light curve’s white noise level was in-
creased by the ratio of the Kepler-to-K2 white noise if
that ratio was less than unity at the Kepler star’s mag-
nitude. In practice, this resulted in increasing the white
noise level for stars fainter than Kp = 14, by on average
10% and by no more than 20%.

We show in Figure 4a the SNR of the synthetic sam-
ple.7 We compute the SNR of the synthetic K2 data in a
way that takes into account both the expected maximum
mode amplitude and the granulation background level
at νmax. To do so, we adopt the approach from Cam-
pante et al. (2016), assuming 3 modes per order, ignor-
ing observation integration time eﬀects, and assuming a
noise level according to the observed star-to-star white
noise level at high frequencies in the spectra. For the
mode maximum amplitude, we adopt the model M4,β
from Corsaro et al. (2013). The points are colored by

the provenance of the Kepler data, where there are po-
tentially multiple synthetic stars per KIC ID because of
the division of the Kepler light curves into 80d sections.
In total, there are 57 synthetic stars from the M-giant
catalogue (Stello et al. 2014); 891 synthetic stars from
the faint giant catalogue (Mathur et al. 2016); and 1691
synthetic stars from the APOKASC catalogue (Pinson-
neault et al. 2018). The dashed lines demarcate the
boundaries of our grid used to draw the synthetic light
curves in νmax space. We also show the distribution in
magnitude space in Figure 4b, with vertical lines demar-
cating the magnitude bins used to populate the synthetic
sample.

The pipelines’ analysis of these synthetic K2 data pro-
ceeded blindly (i.e., the synthetic data were treated as
real data), and the resulting asteroseismic parameters
were processed using an iteration of the averaging pro-
cedure described in §3.2. The average results are de-
noted in the following ﬁgures as ‘ALL’, and any pipeline-
speciﬁc results for synthetic K2 data are only shown if
they pass the same muster as the real data (i.e., having
at least two pipelines return results).

In Figure 5, we show the accuracy of the recovery for
each of the asteroseismic pipelines, based on the ground-
truth Kepler asteroseismic values. For this exercise, each
pipeline analyzed the Kepler light curves to generate
ground-truth labels. For the purposes of this plot and
those that follow, uncertainties on the binned median
are computed by inﬂating the standard uncertainty on
the binned mean by a factor of (cid:112) π
2 (Kenney & Keeping
1962).

We show the trends in the K2 asteroseismic values as a
function of both νmax and ∆ν, and which are evident at
the percent level as a function of νmax and ∆ν. There are
also biases when averaged over all of νmax and ∆ν, which
can be seen by the fact that the trends for some pipelines
in Figure 5 are systematically oﬀset below the one-to-
one line. This suggests that there are non-negligible
systematics in asteroseismic pipeline recovery that are a
function of baseline, and which would result in too-small
radii and masses compared to Kepler asteroseismology
(see the below comparison between mass distributions
in K2 and Kepler). Time baseline seems to have the
smallest impact on ∆ν, since several pipelines report
nearly identical ∆ν with Kepler as with K2 data (though
some pipelines show substantial disagreement). νmax,
however, suﬀers from signiﬁcant biases based on the time
baseline: excursions of a 2 − 3% and zero-point biases
of 1 − 2% are observed. There are also indications that
some pipelines may have SNR-dependent biases, which
manifest as trends in the fractional agreement between
Kepler and synthetic K2 values as a function of SNR

in Figure 6. Note that the SNR shown in this ﬁgure
is not the same SNR as shown in Figure 4a: the SNR
in Figure 6 represents the relative SNR at ﬁxed νmax,
and is computed by dividing out the median trend from
Figure 4a.

Although we will be calibrating our K2 data based
on independent estimates of radius in §4, these biases
are important to note, and are being investigated in the
context of TESS (Stello et al. 2021). It should also be
noted that there could be additional biases introduced
in asteroseismic analysis based on the preparation of the
pixel-level data and the details of processing the light
curves into power spectra (e.g., choices in frequency
ﬁlter). Based on internal consistency checks against
K2SFF light curves (Vanderburg & Johnson 2014), such
eﬀects are smaller than time baseline biases shown here
(< 1%).

Apart from testing the νmax-, ∆ν- SNR- and time
baseline–dependent biases in pipeline results, we can
also test the internal consistency of the uncertainties
using the synthetic K2 data. Since we have results from
precise Kepler data, we can compare it to the less pre-
cise, simulated K2 data for the same stars, and evaluate
if pipeline results are internally consistent to within their
reported uncertainties. To do so, the observed distribu-
tion of the fractional deviation between the K2 and the
Kepler measurements (‘true’ in Fig. 7) is compared to
the expected distribution (‘reported’ in Figure 7), cre-
ated by drawing Gaussian random variables assuming
the reported K2 uncertainty for each simulated K2 star.
If the reported uncertainties were self-consistent, then
the two distributions would be identical. If the pipeline
tends to over-estimate uncertainties, the ‘reported’ dis-
tribution would be skewed toward higher uncertainties
compared to the ‘true’ distribution, and vice versa. The

internal consistency is globally good for most pipelines.
This plot also indicates the relative precision of the
pipelines, with the dashed line indicating σ∆ν = 0.01
and σνmax = 0.03, which are representative values for the
internal uncertainties for the pipelines. For ∆ν, there is
perhaps a tendency that the pipelines that provide re-
sults for fewer stars (and hence maybe are more strict in
accepting which measurements are valid) show smaller
deviations between ‘true’ and ‘reported’ values. By the
same token, the more values a pipeline accepts as valid,
the more results deviating strongly from the truth are
reported.

The above exercise tests the internal consistency of
the uncertainties reported by each pipeline, but, by
comparing the reported uncertainties to the scatter in
max(cid:105) and σ(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) de-
the pipeline values for each star, σ(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
scribed in §3, we can better establish the accuracy of the
pipeline uncertainties. Indeed, even if a pipeline consis-
tently assigns uncertainties to their parameters, it does
not necessarily correspond to the true uncertainty —
i.e., including systematic uncertainties — in the phys-
ical parameter: each pipeline’s methodology is on its
own system and measures νmax and ∆ν in slightly dif-
ferent ways. This can be seen to the extent that the
scaling factors for each pipeline, Xνmax and X∆ν, diﬀer
from unity, indicating that the pipelines measure aster-
oseismic values on scales that diﬀer by up to 1%. Even
after correction to the mean scale, the top panels of
Figures 8-11 show that there are residual fractional de-
viations between re-scaled pipeline values and the mean
values across pipelines, ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) as a function of
νmax and ∆ν. By adopting the scatter across pipelines
in asteroseismic values as our uncertainties in K2 GAP
DR3, we take into account the uncertainties due to these
diﬀerences in pipeline methodologies. We show compar-

Table 2 as ς(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and ς(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105). These latter uncertain-
ties are larger than our adopted empirical uncertainties
in this work, σ(cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) and σ(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105), by factors of ∼ 2.2
and ∼ 1.5, respectively. Assuming a correlation of 0.1
among all pipelines reduces the diﬀerences to ∼ 1.2 and
0.95. Because the reported pipeline uncertainties are to
varying degrees unreliable (Fig. 7) and because of the
unknown correlation among diﬀerent pipeline measure-
ments, these uncertainties are not used in this analysis,
but are rather provided as a conservative indication of a
purely statistical uncertainty compared to our adopted
empirical uncertainties, σ(cid:104)ν(cid:48)

max(cid:105) and σ(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105).

We next estimate the completeness of each pipeline’s
results by comparing the number of recovered stars to
the total number of synthetic stars. The completeness
fraction, where 1.0 indicates a perfect recovery rate, is
shown as a function of νmax, ∆ν, radius, and mass in
Figures 12-15. The synthetic sample was created with
a range of SNRs, and with magnitude-dependent noise
consistent with K2 data, but the distribution of the syn-
thetic sample is not, in detail, representative of the K2
GAP DR3 sample. For this reason, the completeness
curves plotted in Figures 12-15 are indicative but not
determinative of the completeness of the respective pa-
rameters in K2 GAP DR3. Note also that the com-
pleteness is deﬁned with respect to Kepler results, so
this completeness is, strictly speaking, an estimate of
the completeness of recovering K2 data with respect to
Kepler and not necessarily an absolute completeness es-
timate, which must await a future analysis using Gaia as
a reference (e.g., following the Kepler observation com-
pleteness analysis from Wolniewicz et al. 2021).

We see that the completeness curves are peaked in
the middle of parameter space for νmax and ∆ν, with
lower completeness at high and low values of νmax and
∆ν. This is understood to be related to the frequency
resolution: both ∆ν and νmax detection is limited on
the lower end by the time baseline, and on the upper
end by the sampling rate of the K2 observations.
It
is even more diﬃcult to recover νmax and ∆ν at low
values because of another eﬀect: there are fewer modes
that are excited at low νmax, and they can be diﬃcult
to distinguish from noise, especially at the frequency
resolution of K2. This latter eﬀect is the reason why
there is a marked decrease in completeness for νmax (cid:46)
10µHz. This incompleteness has been noted in previous
data releases (Stello et al. 2017; Zinn et al. 2020) but we
are able to robustly quantify it here for the ﬁrst time:
although it varies by pipeline, at least ≈ 20% of stars
with νmax (cid:46) 10µHz are not detected.

The completeness fractions in radius and mass space
are not one-to-one mappings from νmax and ∆ν, since,
for a given surface gravity (νmax), there is a spread
in mass (∆ν). For this reason, we consider the ra-
dius and mass completeness curves separately from the
νmax and ∆ν cases. The completeness in radius suﬀers
from a drop-oﬀ in recovery with increasing radius, due
to incompleteness in νmax and ∆ν at lower frequencies.
Given the lack of a strong correlation between radius
and age on the giant branch (since the majority of a red
giant’s lifetime is spent on the main sequence as opposed
to climbing the giant branch), the drop-oﬀ in recovery
with increasing radius does not require a selection func-
tion correction in age space, but does have implications
for a selection function correction as a function of dis-
tance. The completeness curves are much less peaked
in mass space. This is of particular interest for Galactic
archaeology applications of K2 GAP DR3: were com-
pleteness a strong function of mass, it would require
special treatment in the selection function. There is
a tendency for low-mass stars to be under-represented
among some pipelines, for M (cid:46) 1.2M(cid:12). This may be
relevant for detailed studies since this will map onto an
under-representation of older stars. Regarding the com-
pleteness of the underlying K2 GAP sample itself, typi-
cally 97% of the proposed targets in any given campaign
were observed, with the targets following simple color-
magnitude cuts (S. Sharma, in prep.).

Figure 16a is indicative of the mass distribution for
those stars in the K2 GAP DR3 sample with both (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105)
and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105), where the ordinate is an asteroseismic proxy
for mass proposed by Huber et al. (2010) that scales like
M 0.25, given the asteroseismic scaling relations (Eqs. 3
& 4). For reference, Figure 16b shows the Kepler sample
from Yu et al. (2018). Comparing the Kepler and K2
samples, we ﬁnd a good correspondence, with a couple
of diﬀerences worth noting. First, the right edge of the
clump is better deﬁned in Kepler data by having bet-
ter precision and more high-mass secondary red clump
stars. The Kepler sample also extends to higher frequen-
cies than does K2 GAP DR3, presumably due to better
noise properties in Kepler compared to K2. However,
K2 has double the fraction of low-frequency (< 20µHz)
oscillators than does Kepler, in spite of the tendency to
not recover stars in this frequency regime with K2-like
time baselines (Fig. 12). Note that the overall shift in
mass between the Yu et al. (2018) and K2 GAP DR3
samples is consistent with the time baseline systematics
in νmax (Fig. 5), such that the SYD Kepler νmax values
would be expected to be larger by ∼ 1% than K2 νmax
values.

Figure 7. Reported pipeline fractional uncertainty distributions on K2 asteroseismic values (‘reported’) and the inferred
fractional uncertainty distributions by comparing Kepler and K2 values (‘true’). The dashed lines are shown for reference, and
correspond to fractional uncertainties of 1% for ∆ν and 3% for νmax.

As with Figure 16a, Figure 17 shows the K2 GAP
DR3 stars in the mass proxy v. νmax space, but for each
pipeline and separately for raw pipeline results (νmax,
max, ∆ν(cid:48);
∆ν; left panels) and re-scaled pipeline values (ν(cid:48)
right panels). The structures of the distributions in this
space are generally similar across pipelines, though there
are diﬀerences in detail. For instance, we see that there
are some pipeline-dependent diﬀerences in the recovery
of low-mass red clump stars and the recovery of low-
frequency stars. There are also diﬀerences between the
raw and re-scaled values, the most salient of which are
that 1) raw values have more scatter in the ordinate
(due to requiring more than one pipeline returning re-
sults to deﬁne the re-scaled values, which will tend to se-
lect stars with more precise asteroseimsic values) and 2)
there tend to be fewer low-frequency and high-frequency
re-scaled values (a selection eﬀect of it being less likely
for multiple pipelines to return values for stars aﬀected
by K2’s white noise and time baseline). The diagonal
ridge on the left side of the red clump distribution is

due to requiring that stars with ∆ν < 3.2 be assigned a
red giant branch evolutionary state (see §3.2). However,
we see that this choice does not cut out true red clump
stars, which are found in the locus where the density of
the blue points saturates.

4.2. Asteroseismic calibration with Gaia
In §3, we indicated that it is important to use ap-
propriate solar reference values, according to the aster-
oseismic pipeline being used. The K2 GAP DR3 val-
ues are averages across pipelines, so the question arises
as to what solar reference value scale is appropriate.
One proposal would be to adopt the solar reference
values from APOKASC-2 (Pinsonneault et al. 2018),
νmax,(cid:12) = 3076µHz and ∆ν(cid:12) = 135.146µHz, given that
APOKASC-2 values are also averages across pipelines.
Although we follow a very similar methodology to place
the pipeline values on a common scale, it diﬀers in some
regards (e.g., sigma-clipping and not weighting pipeline
values by uncertainties during the averaging process).

As well, we include results from BAM, which was not
a pipeline considered in Pinsonneault et al. (2018). For
max(cid:105) and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105)
this reason, we cannot assume that (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
are on the same scale as deﬁned by Pinsonneault et al.
(2018) just because we use the solar reference values
from the cluster calibration procedure in Pinsonneault
et al. (2018). It is also possible that the diﬀerence in Ke-
pler versus K2 observation duration results in systemat-
ically diﬀerent parameter measurements (see §4.1).

With this in mind, in what follows, we calibrate the K2
GAP DR3 (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105) values using a non-unity, scalar fνmax
(§3), or, equivalently, by re-scaling the APOKASC-2
νmax,(cid:12) value. Our Gaia calibration sample is the sub-
set of stars in the K2 GAP DR3 sample with (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105)
and (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) that have APOGEE DR16 (Ahumada et al.
2020) temperatures & metallicities and Gaia parallaxes
& proper motions from Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia Col-
laboration et al. 2018; Lindegren et al. 2018).

With the known zero-point oﬀset in Gaia parallax
(e.g., Lindegren et al. 2018; Khan et al. 2019; Zinn et al.
2019a) in mind, we appeal to the methodology described
in Sch¨onrich et al. (2019), which infers distances in Gaia-
based bulk stellar motions. This method can be sensitive
to knowing the selection function of the stellar popula-
tion, and so we take care to model the selection func-
tion of GAP targets according to Sch¨onrich & Aumer
(2017). The resulting parallax zero-points show a scat-
ter of ∼ 10µas across the campaigns, comparable to the
positional variation found by Chan & Bovy (2020) and
Khan et al. (2019).

We perform the calibration using a subset of the Gaia-
APOGEE-K2 overlap, knowing that there are certain
known systematics that could bias the calibration. First,
we limit the impact of parallax zero-point by only work-
ing with stars with raw Gaia parallaxes of π > 0.4mas,
parallax uncertainties less than 10%, and Gaia G-band
magnitude < 13mag, out of an abundance of caution, in

light of indications of parallax- and magnitude depen-
dent oﬀsets (Sch¨onrich et al. 2019; Zinn et al. 2019a).
We also reject metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < −1) from
subsequent analysis, since there are indications that as-
teroseismic scaling relation systematics could exist in
the metal-poor regime (Epstein et al. 2014; Zinn et al.
2019b; though see Kallinger et al. 2018). We further re-
ject stars that are highly evolved (R > 30R(cid:12)), in order
to avoid potential systematics in the asteroseismic scale
in the luminous regime (Mosser et al. 2013; Stello et al.
2014; Kallinger et al. 2018; Zinn et al. 2019b). Finally,
we reject from consideration 12 RGB and 2 RC stars
that have asteroseismic and Gaia radius disagreement by
more than 3σ, leaving 841 RGB and 214 RC stars for cal-
ibration. Since this sample has APOGEE spectroscopic
abundances, we also modify the f∆ν for our calibration

sample by adjusting the metallicity that goes into com-
puting f∆ν to account for non-solar α abundances ac-
cording to the Salaris et al. (1993) prescription.

The Gaia radii are computed following the proce-
dure from Zinn et al. (2017), wherein a bolometric ﬂux,
Gaia parallax, and APOGEE eﬀective temperature are
combined using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. We use a
Ks-band bolometric correction (Gonz´alez Hern´andez &
Bonifacio 2009) to minimize extinction eﬀects, and em-
ploy the three-dimensional dust map of Green et al.
(2015), as implemented in mwdust8 (Bovy et al. 2016).
We see in Figure 18 similar trends as we did in K2
GAP DR2 (Zinn et al. 2020): there is an over-estimation

in the asteroseismic radii compared to Gaia at and below
R ≈ 8R(cid:12) among red giant branch stars.

The strong trend in radius agreement for the RC is
of astrophysical interest, particularly given constraints
on mass-loss (e.g., Miglio et al. 2012; Kallinger et al.
2018) that rely on the accuracy of asteroseismic scaling
relations for the RC. However, as we noted in Zinn et al.
2020, the trend seems to be mostly a function of ∆ν,
and therefore may be related to inadequacies in the red
clump stellar structure models that underpin theoretical
f∆ν calculations (An et al. 2019). It is beyond the scope
of the present work to further examine the cause of the
discrepancy, but developments in better understanding
this behavior in the RC are in preparation.

We calibrate our K2 GAP DR3 asteroseismic values
to be on the Gaia parallactic scale by adopting the fol-
lowing:

where σR = Rseis

separately for RGB and RC stars, ﬁnding fνmax,RGB =
1.017 ± 0.001 and fνmax,RC = 1.008 ± 0.003. This can
be thought of as a re-scaling of the solar reference value,
νmax,(cid:12), though for convenience, we apply this correc-
tion directly to the (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105), (cid:104)κR(cid:105), and (cid:104)κM (cid:105) values pro-
vided in Table 2, and thus when working with (cid:104)ν(cid:48)
max(cid:105),
the K2 GAP DR3 νmax,(cid:12) value given in Table 1 should
be used, which is the same as that from (Pinsonneault
et al. 2018). Even after accounting for this fνmax, the
uncertainty in the fνmax becomes a systematic uncer-
tainty in the (cid:104)κR(cid:105), and (cid:104)κM (cid:105) scales, viz., 0.1% & 0.3%
in (cid:104)κR(cid:105) & (cid:104)κM (cid:105) for RGB stars and 0.3% & 0.9% for
RC stars. Note that it is possible there is a scalar cor-
rection required of (cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105), as well. We therefore con-
servatively treat the uncertainty in fνmax as an uncer-
tainty in a scalar contribution to f 2
∆ν, given that our
calibration of the asteroseismic radius, which scales as
f −1
f 2
∆ν (Eq. 6), is formally a calibration of the quan-
νmax
f 2
tity f −1
∆ν. This implies a systematic uncertainty in
νmax
(cid:104)∆ν(cid:48)(cid:105) of 0.05% and 0.15% for RGB stars and RC stars,
respectively. As discussed in Zinn et al. (2019b), there
are additional systematics in the asteroseismology-Gaia
radius comparison that could amount to about ±2% in
fνmax, and which are due to intrinsic uncertainties in the
bolometric correction scale, the temperature scale, and
the spatial correlations in Gaia parallaxes.

On balance, the modest corrections required to bring
the asteroseismic data onto the Gaia parallactic scale
support previous ﬁndings that the asteroseismic scaling
relations are accurate to within a few to several percent

tainties on the medians of the fractional diﬀerence in astero-

between the two radii. We re-deﬁne νmax,(cid:12) for the RGB

their radii agree on average with Gaia radii (see Table 3).

on the lower giant branch (e.g., Silva Aguirre et al. 2012;
Huber et al. 2012; Hall et al. 2019; Khan et al. 2019;
Zinn et al. 2019b). With the assurance that the K2 GAP
DR3 asteroseismic masses are well-calibrated, we turn to
applications of those data to age-abundance patterns.

5. AGE-ABUNDANCE PATTERNS IN K2 GAP DR3

5.1. Notes on GALAH abundances

Our examination of age-abundance patterns makes
use of GALAH (GALactic Archaeology with HERMES)
DR3 (Buder et al. 2021) abundances for stars targeted
as part of the K2-HERMES (Wittenmyer et al. 2018)
program. Although our asteroseismic calibration uses
APOGEE temperatures and metallicities for deriving
asteroseismic radii (§4.2), we note that calibration using
GALAH spectroscopic parameters instead results in an
equivalent fνmax to within uncertainties. We opt to use
GALAH abundances in what follows because 1) there
are neutron-capture element lines in the optical unavail-
able to APOGEE’s infrared bandpass, and 2) GALAH

51015Rseis[R(cid:12)]RGBRC5.07.510.012.515.0RGaia[R(cid:12)]0.00.2(Rseis−RGaia)/RGaia20

Zinn et al.

abundances are corrected for non-LTE eﬀects for the el-
ements H, Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Mn, Fe,
and Ba. On the latter point, non-LTE spectral analysis
seems especially important for bringing into agreement
dwarf and giant abundances at ﬁxed metallicitiy within
∼ 0.05 dex (Amarsi et al. 2020), though some system-
atics at the 0.1-0.2dex level may remain for Al, Ba, and
α-elements, which are mentioned below.

We note that APOGEE DR16 temperatures and
GALAH DR3 temperatures for RGB stars diﬀer by
≈ 30K, in the sense that APOGEE temperatures tend
to be hotter. This diﬀerence is at the same level as
the intrinsic uncertainty in the APOGEE temperature
scale, which is set by the accuracy of the infrared ﬂux
method (IRFM) temperature scale for red giants (e.g.,
Alonso et al. 1999; Gonz´alez Hern´andez & Bonifacio
2009). The metallicity scales of the two systems dif-
fer by ≈ −0.05dex, in the sense that APOGEE is more
metal-rich. The combined eﬀect of these small oﬀsets
means that the asteroseismic parameter calibration per-
formed with APOGEE temperatures in §4 is consistent
to within systematic uncertainties of fνmax and thus the
calibrated parameters are suitable for the following anal-
ysis using GALAH temperatures.

It should also be noted that scattering on background
opacities was not included in the GALAH DR3 non-LTE
calculations. Background scattering may aﬀect giant
abundances at the 0.01dex level for elements other than
C, Mg, Ca, and Mn, which can have larger eﬀects due to
background scattering at lower metallicities (e.g., Hayek
et al. 2011). Among metal-poor giants, Mg, Ca, and Mn
may thus be under-estimated by up to 0.05 dex for stars
with [Fe/H] < −2 (Amarsi et al. 2020).

5.2. Benchmark Galactic chemical evolution model

We compare our age-abundance patterns to the ﬁdu-
cial abundance models of Kobayashi et al. (2020a; K20).
The models use nucleosynthetic yields from CCSNe,
SNe Ia, AGB stars, and neutron stars mergers, which
are discussed as relevant in the discussion that follows.
The K20 models assume a one-zone enrichment model,
wherein mixing of the interstellar medium is instanta-
neous, and there is pristine gas inﬂow. The infall rate
and star formation eﬃciency are chosen to match the
metallicity distribution function of the solar neighbor-
hood. For the solar neighborhood model considered
here, there is assumed to be no gas outﬂow. K20 assume
single-degenerate SNe Ia, where the total number of SNe
is determined from the O/Fe slope. The fraction of main
sequence+white dwarf to RGB+white dwarf progenitors
is ﬁt to reproduce the observed Galactic metallicity dis-
tribution function (see, e.g., Figure A2 of Kobayashi

et al. 2020b). We note that the [Fe/H] at which SNe
Ia begin to go oﬀ in the K20 models is not simply de-
termined by the delay-time distribution of SNe Ia, but
rather the metallicity-dependence of Fe production in
SNe Ia (Kobayashi et al. 1998). This is because the K20
models’ SNe Ia single-degenerate scenario assumes that
white dwarfs surpass the Chandrasekhar mass limit by
metallicity-dependent white dwarf winds that prevent
common envelope production and encourage stable mass
transfer (see Hachisu et al. 1996; Kobayashi et al. 1998;
Kobayashi & Nomoto 2009).

The K20 models we use are representative of the so-
lar neighborhood, and so we restrict our analysis to K2
GAP DR3 stars with Galactocentric distances between
7 and 9kpc.

Because the K20 models are calibrated to observa-
tions purely in abundance space and not with reference
to stellar age measurements, comparing the observed K2
GAP DR3 age-abundance patterns to the models pro-
vides an independent check on the success of the as-
sumed global (star formation rate, infall rate) and local
(nucleosynthetic yields) model choices. Of particular in-
terest in what follows are the implications for the nucle-
osynthetic site of production and yields. For compar-
isons of GALAH DR3 abundance ratios to K20 models,
we refer the reader to Amarsi et al. (2020).

5.3. Ages

We derive ages from K2 GAP DR3 asteroseismic
masses computed according to Equation 4 with (cid:104)κM (cid:105)
and GALAH DR3 temperatures. The age inference
is performed in a Bayesian framework using BSTEP
(Sharma et al. 2018), a Bayesian stellar parameter es-
timator that may incorporate asteroseismic parameters,
νmax and ∆ν, which essentially constrain the mass of the
star and therefore its main sequence lifetime. Further
details regarding the BSTEP ages used in this work are
available in Sharma et al. (2021) (see also Buder et al.
(2021)). In what follows, we only use stars that BSTEP
classiﬁes with high conﬁdence as RGB, given uncertain-
ties on RC ages due to mass loss (e.g., Casagrande et al.
2016).

5.4.

[Mg/H] versus [Fe/H] space

We begin by dividing our sample into high- and low-α
samples, following the high-low boundary from Wein-
berg et al. (2019; W19):

for [Fe/H] < 0 : [Fe/Mg] > 0.12 − 0.13[Fe/H], (9)

for [Fe/H] > 0 : [Fe/Mg] > 0.12.

(10)

The above division was initially used for stars with
APOGEE abundances, though it has subsequently been

K2 GAP DR3

21

used successfully to divide GALAH DR2 (Buder et al.
2018) abundances into high- and low-α populations by
Griﬃth et al. (2019; GJW19), who recently interpreted
both APOGEE and GALAH DR2 abundance ratios in
the context of Galactic chemical evolution. Following
the example of GJW19, we also restrict analysis to those
stars with eﬀective temperatures between 4500K and
6200K, which avoids blending in cool stars from molec-
ular lines and highly broadened lines in fully radiative
stars.

We believe there is some contamination from gen-
uinely α-poor stars that, by virtue of their abundance
uncertainties, scatter into the high-α selection (and vice
versa). For this reason, we require that each star’s 2D
uncertainty ellipse have more than 95% of its density
on one side or the other of the high-/low-α division
line. In order to construct the 2D uncertainty ellipse,
we assume a uniform correlation between [Fe/H] and
[Mg/Fe]. The Pearson correlation coeﬃcient between
[Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] is observed to be ∼ −0.4, though
the precise value adopted does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect
our results. We also require stars to have [Fe/H] > −1
at 95% conﬁdence, since the metal-poor stellar popu-
lation is likely populated by accretion (e.g., Belokurov
et al. 2018; Haywood et al. 2018) rather than in situ for-
mation, as the K20 models assume. The resulting divi-
sion of the GALAH abundances is demonstrated in Fig-
ure 19, where each star is colored by its age. The high-
/low-α division line is shown in black. The grey curve
represents the raw K20 [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] trend, which has
been shifted by a scalar oﬀset in [Fe/H] and a scalar oﬀ-
set in [Mg/Fe] to reﬂect the same solar abundance scale
used by GALAH DR3 (see Table A2 of Buder et al.
2021).9 The segmented blue curve represents the K20
[Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] trend, re-scaled by an additive oﬀset in
Mg such that the median predicted [Mg/Fe] agrees with
the median observed [Mg/Fe]. The band around the
curve corresponds to a 1σ uncertainty in the Asplund
et al. (2009) solar abundances, which are used in the
K20 models for abundance normalization.10

The sample consists of 396 high-α stars and 208 low-
α stars, with typical uncertainties of 20-30% in age.11
The ages for this sample, as well as their GALAH spec-

9 Where possible, we adopt the ‘composite’ abundance normaliza-
tions listed in Table A2 of Buder et al. (2021) and, otherwise, the
average of a given elements’ line-by-line normalizations.

10 The exception is O, whose solar abundance is taken to be

A(cid:12)(O) = 8.76 ± 0.02 (Steﬀen et al. 2015).

11 These are the number of stars with Mg and Fe measurements,
which are necessary to deﬁne the high-α and low-α stars. Note
that not all of these stars have abundance measurements for every
element we consider in what follows.

troscopic information, and high-/low-α classiﬁcation are
provided in Table 8.

We follow the example of W19 and GJW19 in con-
sidering abundance ratio and age-abundance patterns
in [X/Mg] space instead of only [X/Fe] space due to the
expectation that nearly all Mg production occurs in CC-
SNe, whereas Fe is produced by both CCSNe and SNe
Ia. Therefore, the low-α population can be interpreted
as having SNe Ia contributions, and the high-α popula-
tion as enriched by CCSNe. Normalizing by Mg means
that elements produced only by CCSNe have the same
trends in both the low- and high-α regimes. Elements
with contributions from SNe Ia, however, will show a
separation in [X/Mg] v. [Mg/H] that depends on the rel-
ative contribution of CCSNe and SNe Ia. We note that
other enrichment channels like AGB winds that do not
behave precisely like CCSNe or SNe Ia in their Mg pro-
duction and delay-time distribution may complicate in-
terpretations of the [X/Mg] versus [Mg/H] trends. Ulti-
mately, showing age-abundance patterns and abundance
ratios in [Mg/H] space in addition to [Fe/H] space can of-
fer complementary information to the asteroseismic age
information. For instance, CCSNe elements would be
expected to 1) have constant [X/Mg] as a function of
stellar age; 2) decreasing [X/Fe] as a function of stellar
age; and 3) show similar [X/Mg] trends as a function of
[Mg/H] for both high- and low-α populations.

We show the distribution of high-α ages in Figure 20.
The ﬁlled orange histogram shows the distribution of
high-α ages larger than 5 Gyr. The orange line indi-
cates the distribution of a simulated population of these
stars assuming a mean age of 9 Gyr and with uncer-
tainties taken from the fractional uncertainties of the
data. The grey line indicates a population consistent
with being ‘young’ high-α stars, which were originally
identiﬁed in CoRoT (Baglin et al. 2006) & APOGEE
data (Chiappini et al. 2015), and have since been seen
in Kepler and K2 data (e.g., Martig et al. 2015; Silva
Aguirre et al. 2018; Warﬁeld et al. 2021). These stars
may be genuinely old and appear young due to having
gained mass through stellar mergers (e.g., Martig et al.
2015; Jofr´e et al. 2016; Izzard et al. 2018; Sun et al.
2020), or perhaps are genuinely young and have formed
in gas relatively unenriched by SNe Ia (Chiappini et al.
2015; Johnson et al. 2021). We therefore draw a distinc-
tion between this population and the rest of the high-α
population, which are consistent with having a uniform
age of ∼ 9 Gyr according to a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
We show in Figures 21-29 abundance ratios ([X/Fe]
versus [Fe/H] or [X/Mg] versus [Mg/H]) and age-
abundance patterns/enrichment histories ([X/Fe] versus
stellar age or [X/Mg] versus stellar age) for diﬀerent nu-

cleosynthetic families of elements. A running weighted
average of the data are shown as colored error bars con-
nected by lines, with green indicating the low-α popula-
tion and orange indicating the high-α population. Not
plotted are stars with ﬂagged GALAH DR3 abundance
measurements in [Fe/H] or in [X/Fe]. As mentioned
above, the extent to which the low-α (green curves)
pattern is above the high-α (orange curves) pattern in
[X/Mg]-[Mg/H] space is generally indicative of nucle-
osynthetic production site.

Regarding how to compare the K20 models with the
data in these ﬁgures, we note that at young and inter-
mediate ages, the K20 models may be best interpreted
as a low-α population, while the models represent a
high-α population at old ages. Because K20 models are
one-zone models, there is a one-to-one mapping of age
to abundance, which is not necessarily the case in the
data. To guide the eye, we therefore highlight in Fig-
ure 19 and subsequent ﬁgures where the data should be
compared to the models: bold curves indicate solidly
old/metal-poor high-α stars or young/metal-rich low-α
stars, which are comparable to the K20 modelled pop-
ulations shown in blue, whereas light curves indicate
apparent young high-α or old low-α populations not di-
rectly comparable to the K20 models. To evaluate the
agreement of the models with the data for older, high-α
stars, we make reference here and in what follows to a
single weighted average of the high-α abundances (which
can be seen as a single orange error bar in the following
ﬁgures), since the width of the high-α age distribution
is dominated by uncertainties, and has a central value
of ≈ 9 Gyr.

5.5. α elements: O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti

Looking at O in Figure 21,

it is clear that, after
a global correction, the observed abundance ratios for
[Fe/H] > −1 are in excellent agreement with K20 model
predictions. That the metallicity-dependence of O en-
richment agrees with observations is a built-in feature
of the models: K20 models are adjusted by tuning the
total number of supernovae to agree with the observed
literature O abundance metallicity dependence (K20).
With age information in hand, however, we can inde-
pendently test the models. We see that the agreement
is good when looking at the low-α [O/Mg] trend as a
function of time up to τ ∼ 8Gyr, tracking Mg produc-
tion, as an α element would. We see that the high-α
[O/Fe] enrichment history is in tension with model pre-
dictions at 9Gyr (orange error bar versus blue curve).
Given the agreement of the high-α population [O/Fe]
as a function of [Fe/H], the disagreement of [O/Fe] for
the high-α population in age space suggests an oﬀset in

Figure 19. We divide our GALAH DR3 + K2 GAP DR3
sample into high- and low-α samples, following the proposed
division from Weinberg et al. (2019; Eq. 9). The stars indi-
cated by orange points are accordingly classiﬁed as high-
α stars and the stars indicated by green points as low-α
stars; the green and orange error bars and curves indicate
the 2σ uncertainties on the binned weighted mean of the
low-α and high-α stars. The Galactic chemical evolution
model from Kobayashi et al. (2020a; K20) is shown before
(grey dotted curve) and after (blue segmented curve) an ad-
ditive correction to [Mg/Fe] to enforce agreement with the
median [Mg/Fe] of the observed stars. The region around the
blue segmented curve reﬂects the 1σ uncertainty in the K20
abundance normalization, taken to be the uncertainties in
the solar abundances from Asplund et al. (2009). The trans-
parency of the binned weighted means of the data emphasizes
where the K20 models track the high-α stars ([Fe/H] (cid:46) −0.3
and τ (cid:38) 8Gyr) and the low-α stars ([Fe/H] (cid:38) −0.3 and
τ (cid:46) 8Gyr).

Figure 20. The distribution of high-α ages (ﬁlled orange)
is consistent with being drawn from a uniform age of 9 Gyr
(as simulated in the orange lines). A separate population of
young high-α stars with ages (cid:46) 5 Gyr is shown in grey, and
is consistent with previous identiﬁcations of a young high-α
population in the literature.

Figure 21. Abundance ratios and age-abundance patterns for α elements, shown in both [X/Fe] and [X/Mg] space. The green
and orange error bars and curves indicate the 2σ uncertainties in the binned weighted mean of the low-α and high-α stars.
The blue segmented curves show the predictions from the Galactic chemical evolution model of (Kobayashi et al. 2020a; K20),
displaced additively in X to agree with the median [X/Fe] or [X/Mg] of the observed stars (grey dashed curves indicate the
models before this re-scaling) and colored by either [Fe/H], [Mg/H], or age, according to the color bars. The transparency in
the weighted means of the data emphasizes where the K20 models track the high-α stars ([Fe/H] (cid:46) −0.3 and τ (cid:38) 5Gyr) and
the low-α stars ([Fe/H] (cid:38) −0.3 and τ (cid:46) 8Gyr). We note that not every star has GALAH measurements for every element,
particularly at low metallicities.

the observed and predicted high-α ages. A natural so-
lution would be to appeal to α-enhanced stellar model
opacities.
Indeed, Warﬁeld et al. (2021) have demon-
strated the increase in stellar opacities due to non-solar
α abundances can increase low-mass (old) stellar ages by
≈ 10% by decreasing core temperature and extending a
red giant’s main sequence lifetime. For the majority of
elements considered in what follows of §5, an increase in
the high-α ages of that magnitude would improve agree-
ment between the data and models. The global oﬀset
required to match the O abundances at high metallic-
ities (blue curves versus grey dashed curves), could be
due to GALAH α-element abundances O, Mg, and Si
having residual oﬀsets of 0.1dex, in the sense that gi-

ants have larger [α/Fe] compared to dwarfs even after
non-LTE corrections (Amarsi et al. 2020).

Both Ca and Si in Figure 21 show good agreement
between the predicted and observed enrichment history:
the predicted enrichment history at ages τ (cid:46) 8Gyr
tracks the observed trend (green curve) in [Mg/H] and
[Fe/H] space. The models also predict a [Si/Fe] at 9Gyr
consistent with the observed abundances of the old high-
α population (orange error bar).

We consider Ti an α element, based on the ﬁndings in
GJW19 that its production seems to be dominated by
CCSNe contributions. Indeed, both the low-α and high-
α curves share a similar [Ti/Mg] in Figure 21. At older
ages, however, the observed high-α [Ti/Fe] abundances
are in tension with model predictions for 9Gyr, which

24

Zinn et al.

could be improved via older ages from aforementioned
α-enhanced stellar model opacities. Note that there is
a large zero-point oﬀset between the raw model abun-
dances and the observed abundances (the oﬀset to bring
the raw model abundances into agreement with obser-
vations is the diﬀerence between the grey dashed curves
and the blue segmented curves), which is a generic fea-
ture of nucleosynthetic Ti yield predictions, and may
be remedied by 2- or 3-dimensional supernovae models
(K20).

5.6. Light odd-Z elements: Na, Al, K

Odd-Z element production is thought to depend on
progenitor metallicity because their assumed produc-
tion during explosive nucleosynthesis in CCSNe depends
crucially on the neutron excess prior to the supernova,
which itself is dependent on CNO cycle eﬃciency and
therefore intial metal content (e.g., Truran & Arnett
1971). The prediction of nucleosynthetic models for
these elements, therefore is that 1) they should fol-
low a CCSNe enrichment history (either a decreasing

[X/Fe] with younger stellar ages or, equivalently, con-
stant [X/Mg] with stellar age), and 2) they should be
less abundant with decreasing metallicity. In Figure 22,
we show the light, odd-Z elements’ abundance ratios and
age-abundance patterns to test these predictions.

The DR3 GALAH [Na/Mg] abundance ratios show a
positive metallicity trend, consistent with ﬁndings from
GJW19 using GALAH DR2, and broadly consistent
with the predicted metallicity slope from K20 models.
The enrichment history predictions appear to be consis-
tent with observations, across all ages probed (keeping
in mind the lack of resolution in age space for the high-α
stars, which, to within uncertainties, are drawn from a
single age of ≈ 9Gyr).

The strong, negative metallicity gradient seen by
GJW19 in [K/Mg] is less pronounced with non-LTE
corrections in GALAH DR3, and is in good agreement
with K20 models in [Fe/H] space. The absolute abun-
dances from K20 for K, however, are well below the ob-
served value (the grey dashed curve is below the plot-
ted region), and this oﬀset may be alleviated by appeal-

K2 GAP DR3

ing to, e.g., rotating stellar models (K20 and references
therein). The predicted abundances at old stellar age are
consistent with those observed among high-α at 9Gyr.
The non-LTE GALAH DR3 corrections to Al reveal
a strong metallicity trend with [Al/Mg] not found in
GALAH DR2 abundances, but corroborating the posi-
tive trend found in APOGEE abundances (GJW19). We
conﬁrm GJW19’s interpretation of Al being produced
largely in CCSNe production, given the relatively small
separation between high- and low-α tracks (orange and
green curves in [Mg/H] space) compared to, e.g., Na.
These observations are both consistent with theoretical
predictions of signiﬁcant, metallicity-dependent Al pro-
duction during explosive C burning (Truran & Arnett
1971). The observed and predicted enrichment histories
are in disagreement. As with O, older high-α ages due to
α-enhanced stellar model opacities could improve agree-
ment at old ages. This adjustment would also bring Na
and K into even better agreement at old ages. The abso-
lute yields are, as with K, severely under-predicted. This
may very well be due to an over-prediction of the abun-

dances on the observational side: even after non-LTE
corrections, Al abundances for giants are larger than
the dwarf abundances by 0.2dex (Amarsi et al. 2020).

5.7. Iron-peak elements

Following GJW19’s typology of iron-peak elements,
we separate the elements just beyond iron as cliﬀ ele-
ments, which seem to have distinct properties from other
iron-peak elements. First, we consider the odd-Z iron-
peak elements, then the even-Z elements, and, ﬁnally,
iron-peak cliﬀ elements.

5.7.1. Odd-Z iron-peak elements: V, Mn, Co

In this section, we discuss the odd-Z iron-peak ele-
ment abundance patterns and enrichment histories, as
shown in Figure 23. First, we conﬁrm with GALAH
DR3 the metallicity trends at high metallicities in V
and Mn abundances noted by W19 and GJW19 using
APOGEE and GALAH DR2 abundances, respectively.
This metallicity-dependent eﬀect is most pronounced in
Mn, and is in excellent agreement with the model pre-

26

Zinn et al.

dictions for the trend, which is the result of Mn pro-
duction in deﬂagrations with the single-degenerate sce-
nario (Kobayashi et al. 2020b). That the non-LTE Mn
abundances from GALAH DR3 still show a metallicity
dependence is in contrast to the decrease in the metal-
licity dependence going from LTE to non-LTE found in
Battistini & Bensby (2016).

The observed low-α V pattern agrees well with the
K20 predicted [V/Mg] enrichment history including at
older ages, where the observed high-α abundance at
9Gyr broadly agree with the predicted abundance. Nev-
ertheless, the model abundances are uniformly vastly
under-predicted compared to observations before a re-
scaling is applied (grey dashed curves). This under-
prediction could be remedied, however, by using yields
from multi-dimensional supernovae yield predictions
(K20).

The observed and predicted metallicity dependence
for Mn are in very good agreement. K20 models also
reproduce well the enrichment history of [Mn/Mg] and
[Mn/Fe] in the low-α regime. For old, high-α popula-

tions, however, both the [Mn/Mg] and [Mn/Fe] enrich-
ment histories could be improved by older high-α ages
due to α-enhanced stellar model opacities (thereby shift-
ing the orange error bar at 9Gyr to older ages in the Mn
enrichment history panels of Fig. 23).

The Co enrichment history agrees well in [Co/Mg]
space at old ages, though K20 predicts a too-fast en-
richment in the younger low-α population (slope of blue
segmented curve versus slope of green curve). As with V,
the models signiﬁcantly under-predict the global abun-
dances for Co.

5.7.2. Even-Z iron-peak elements: Cr, Ni

To better reproduce the [Cr/Fe] enrichment history
and [Cr/Fe]-[Fe/H] ratios seen in Figure 24,
[Cr/Fe]
could be made to be produced less overall, such as in
the double-degenerate scenario (the green dotted curve
of Fig. 18 in Kobayashi et al. 2020a). Note, however,
that such low [Cr/Fe] results in higher [α/Fe] and lower
[Mn/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] than observed. Otherwise, the ob-
served enrichment history is ﬂatter than predicted in

K2 GAP DR3

27

Figure 25. Same as Figure 21, but for iron-peak cliﬀ elements.

[Fe/H] space, but is in better agreement with the models
in [Mg/H] space. The disagreement between observed
and predicted high-α [Cr/Mg] cannot be redressed only
with aforementioned appeals to older high-α ages due
to α-enhanced stellar model opacities, which would in-
crease tension in high-α [Cr/Fe]. Rather, this would
need to be coupled with a signiﬁcant decrease in the
production of Cr at early times.

Like Cr, the observed age-abundance pattern of Ni
in [Fe/H] space seen in Figure 24 is ﬂatter than pre-
dicted. Though there is broad agreement in the [Ni/Fe]
and [Ni/Mg] high-α enrichment history, it could be im-
proved by an increase (as opposed to a decrease, as
with Cr) in Ni at early times combined with older high-
α ages due to α-enhanced stellar model opacities, as
mentioned earlier. There is also an oﬀset between the
raw model abundances (grey dashed curves) and the ob-
served abundances, though the oﬀset is in the opposite
direction to that of Cr. Note that the metallicity de-
pendence is in good agreement with model predictions
in [Ni/Fe]-[Fe/H] space, in contrast to Cr.

5.7.3. Iron-peak cliﬀ elements: Sc, Cu, Zn

Looking at Figure 25, the observed and predicted
[Zn/Fe] v.
[Fe/H] and age-abundance trend are in
good agreement. The small separation in [Zn/Mg] of
the low- and high-α sequences corroborate the CCSNe-
dominated production assumed in the K20 models
and the interpretations of the Zn abundance ratios in
GJW19 that Zn is mostly a CCSNe element.

The enrichment history predicted by the K20 mod-
els for Cu show strong increases in both [Cu/Mg] and
[Cu/Fe] for younger stellar age, which is in disagreement
with a slight trend in the other direction among the low-
α population (green curves in Fig. 25) in both [Fe/H]
and [Mg/H] space. Slightly higher high-α ages in the
data would help reconcile the observed and predicted
[Cu/Fe].

The Sc age-abundance patterns in Figure 25 show
the same behavior as Cu: the models predict an age-
dependent trend that is in the opposite direction to that
of the observed trends in [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] space, and

28

Zinn et al.

Figure 26. Same as Figure 21, but for weak s-process elements.

the observed high-α population is oﬀset in age compared
to the models.

Taken together, the Cu and Sc trends are suggestive of
diﬀerent nucleosynthetic histories compared to Zn. The
predicted increase in Cu and Sc yields is theoretically
expected due to the metallicity dependence of Cu and
Sc yields since both elements are odd-Z (see §5.6). In-
deed, the data do show this increase in [Cu/Fe] and at
least a ﬂat trend in [Sc/Fe] with [Fe/H] among the low-α
population. The observed age trend (a ﬂat or increas-
ing abundance with increasing age among low-α stars)
is therefore not straightforwardly related to metallicity-
dependent yields, and is an interesting constraint on pro-
duction of these elements; a similar enrichment history
is also seen in the odd-Z element Al (see §5.6).

5.8. Neutron-capture elements

Neutron-capture elements can be produced in one of
two primary channels: s-process and r-process, which
occur in neutron-poor and neutron-rich environments
(for a review, see Truran et al. 2002).

There is evidence of two diﬀerent kinds of r-process
production: a ‘weak’ process that creates elements A (cid:46)
130 − 140 (e.g., Honda et al. 2004) and the main r-
process for elements with A (cid:38) 130 − 140 (Truran et al.
2002). The main r-process production site has been
proposed to be decompressing neutron-rich ejecta from
a neutron star–neutron star (NS-NS) merger (Lattimer
& Schramm 1974; Lattimer et al. 1977; Rosswog et al.
1999). However, the delay-time distribution of NS-NS
mergers is diﬃcult to reconcile with that needed to re-
produce observed r-process enrichment histories both
at early and late times (e.g., Hotokezaka et al. 2018;
Haynes & Kobayashi 2019). Other r-process channels
involving neutrino-driven winds during neutron or mag-
netar birth may be plausible alternatives (e.g., Qian &
Woosley 1996; Hoﬀman et al. 1997).

Like the r-process, there seem to be a weak and main
s-process. The weak s-process occurs in core He burn-
ing of M > 25M(cid:12) stars (Peters 1968; Lamb et al. 1977;
Raiteri et al. 1993), and works by way of neutron pro-
duction from the 22Ne(α, n)25Mg reaction to create free

K2 GAP DR3

Figure 27. Same as Figure 21, but for the weak r-process element, Mo.

neutrons, which can then build elements up to A ≈ 90
(Truran et al. 2002). The main s-process occurs dur-
ing the AGB phase of low- and intermediate-mass stars,
(M ∼ 1 − 3M(cid:12); Schwarzschild & H¨arm 1967) acting
through the 13C(α, n)16O reaction, and forming ele-
ments with A (cid:38) 90.

With K2 GAP DR3 age estimates and GALAH DR3
abundances, we are in a position to test assumed produc-
tion mechanisms of neutron-capture elements by com-
parisons to K20 models.

Electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) are included as
a source of neutron-capture elements in K20 models,
the eﬀect of which is to form ﬁrst-peak s-process ele-
ments Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, and Ru via nuclear equilibrium
processes, as well as weak r-process production from
Nd to In (Wanajo et al. 2011). ECSNe are assumed in
K20 models to occur between the relatively narrow mass
range of ∼ 8.8 − 9M(cid:12); increases of an order of magni-
tude in the electron-capture supernova rate have been
assumed in the literature, and so may be a tunable pa-
rameter to increase bulk yields (see K20 and references
therein). The largest contributors to r-process produc-
tion in the K20 models, however, are magneto-rotational
supernovae (MRSNe), which are theorized to be core-
collapse supernovae of massive stars with large mag-
netic ﬁelds and/or strong rotation, which develop ac-
cretion discs and jets that can be conducive to r-process
production (e.g., Symbalisty et al. 1985; Cameron 2003;
Nishimura et al. 2017). There is also a NS-NS merger
r-process contribution included in K20 models, though
its contribution is subdominant compared to that of
MRSNe.

5.8.1. Weak s-process elements: Rb, Y, Zr

Shown in Figure 26 are the age-abundance ratios of
elements thought to be formed through the ‘weak’ s-
process.12

The agreement between the observed and predicted
age-abundance patterns of [Rb/Mg] and [Rb/Fe] is very
good, across both high- and low-α populations.

Although there is an over-prediction in the abun-
dances for the high-α stars at 9Gyr, the agreement be-
tween K20 models and data are also good for [Zr/Mg]
and [Zr/Fe], as well.

The K20 age-[Y/Mg] pattern does not reach an equi-
librium value, indicating a metallicity-dependence to the
s-process production of Y. This metallicity-dependence
is also borne out in the data, save for a zero-point oﬀ-
set in [Y/Mg]. The predicted enrichment history is in
good agreement in both [Y/Mg] and [Y/Fe] space. The
agreement of the observed and predicted Y enrichment
histories represents another endorsement of dating stars
with Y abundances (e.g., Nissen 2015).

5.8.2. Weak r-process: Mo

Although GALAH can measure Ru, the number of
stars with good Ru measurements is small, and so we
only consider Mo as representative of elements produced
as part of the so-called ‘weak’ r-process.

12 In detail, the K20 models predict that Y and Zr are in fact pro-
duced mostly in low- and intermediate-mass AGB stars as part
of what we label here the main s-process.

30

Zinn et al.

Figure 28. Same as Figure 21, but for main s-process elements.

The K20 models under-predict Mo compared to
GALAH (grey curve versus error bars in Fig. 27), which
is inconsistent with the inferred over-production com-
pared to high-resolution Mo abundance measurements
from the literature (K20). Nevertheless, the predicted
history of Mo enrichment is consistent with the ob-
served [Mo/Fe] and [Mo/Mg] age-abundance patterns
(blue curve compared to error bars).

5.8.3. Main s-process: Ba, La, Ce, Nd

Ba, shown in Figure 28 is thought to be primarily
produced by the s-process at the metallicities considered
here ([Fe/H] > −2; Gilroy et al. 1988; Arlandini et al.
1999; Burris et al. 2000). [Ba/Mg] is predicted to reach a
plateau in young stars according to K20 models, but the
data disfavor a plateau and rather suggest a continually-
increasing ratio with younger ages, like [Y/Mg].

D’Orazi et al. (2009) have observed a similar unex-
pected increase in [Ba/Fe] at young stellar ages, based
on open cluster measurements. They proposed that
an increased production in low-mass stars would ex-

plain the observations, and which could possibly be re-
lated to enhanced mixing into the helium-burning shell
thought to be the site of s-process production in low-
and intermediate-mass AGB stars. Similar behavior has
also been seen in more recent studies (Mishenina et al.
2013; Magrini et al. 2018; Casamiquela et al. 2021). It is
unlikely that this enrichment history is explicable by an
astrophysical, metallicity-dependent yield, since [Ba/Fe]
decreases with increasing [Fe/H], which demonstrates
the advantage of analyzing nucleosynthetic yields with
age information.

Our results therefore corroborate a mass-dependent
Ba yield interpretation,
though it is possible the
GALAH DR3 Ba abundances themselves are responsi-
ble: a trend in Ba with stellar mass would mimic this ef-
fect. One candidate for such a systematic may be choice
in the microturbulance parameter, given the sensitivity
of one of the GALAH Ba lines, Ba II, to that parame-
ter (Dobrovolskas et al. 2012). GALAH DR3 Ba abun-
dances are calculated assuming that RGB stars with the
same eﬀective temperature, surface gravity, and [Fe/H]

have the same microturbulence velocity. That is not
necessarily the case, and could lead to artiﬁcial shifts
in the measured Ba abundance with, e.g., mass/age.
Regarding the zero-point oﬀset in the Ba abundances
compared to the K20 models under no re-scaling (grey
dashed lines), the RGB Ba abundances are systemati-
cally larger than the dwarf abundances by 0.2 dex. Were
the RGB Ba abundances placed on the dwarf scale, then,
there would be an even larger global oﬀset between ob-
servations and models than shown here. On the model
side, K20 noted oﬀsets compared to other literature Ba
abundances, noting that they could be remedied by im-
posing a smaller mixing region during AGB dredge-up.
Based on our ﬁndings, the models may improve agree-
ment with observations more speciﬁcally with a mass-
dependent increase in the mixing region.

The predicted and observed enrichment histories of
La, Ce, and Nd are in good agreement, as seen in Fig-
ure 28. The exception in this agreement is Ce among
high-α stars, which is low compared to predictions, even
after considering a ≈ 10% increase in the observed ages,

potentially indicating the need for less Ce production in
K20 models at early times.

5.8.4. Main r-process elements: Sm, Eu

We show in Figure 29 the abundances of the two main
r-process elements available in GALAH DR3, Sm and
Eu.

Given the relatively few stars in GALAH DR3 with
measured Sm abundances, it is diﬃcult to determine the
precise agreement with K20 models as a function of age.
It does, however, appear that the high-α abundances
at old ages are broadly consistent with the predicted
enrichment history, though could be improved more with
older high-α ages from α-enhanced stellar opacities.

Eu is mostly produced via the r-process (Arlandini
et al. 1999; Battistini & Bensby 2016), and, according
to the K20 models, the primary site of r-process produc-
tion is MRSNe (see Fig. 32 in K20), where the rate of
MRSNe is chosen to be 3% of massive CCSNe (hyper-
novae) with mass M > 25M(cid:12) in order to reproduce the
[Eu/Fe]-[Fe/H] trend in the solar neighborhood.

32

Zinn et al.

The K20 models are in good agreement with both
GALAH abundance ratios, and the asteroseismic age-
abundance patterns in [Eu/Fe], when comparing models
to low-α stars (green curves) at intermediate and young
ages (τ (cid:46) 8Gyr) and comparing models to high-α stars
(orange error bars at 9Gyr in the Eu enrichment history
panels of Fig. 29) at older ages. Consistent with studies
of metal-poor systems with signiﬁcant r-process enrich-
ment (e.g., Barklem et al. 2005; Hansen et al. 2018),
Lin et al. (2019) corroborated the short time-delay of
Eu production sites using isochronal stellar ages of sub-
giants combined with GALAH DR2 abundances. In this
context, the agreement of the observed K2 GAP DR3–
GALAH DR3 Eu enrichment history with that of the
MNSRe-dominated K20 Eu models gives further cre-
dence to a signiﬁcant contribution to r-process elements
from a prompt source — e.g., late-time collapsar accre-
tion disk outﬂows associated with MRSNe (Symbalisty
et al. 1985; Cameron 2003; Nicholl et al. 2013; Vlasov
et al. 2014; Siegel et al. 2019).

6. CONCLUSIONS

The K2 GAP DR3 sample, as the largest asteroseis-
mic sample published to date, and probing a range of
Galactic environment, represents an important tool for
Galactic archaeology and stellar physics. With 18821
total radius and mass coeﬃcients for red giant branch
(RGB) and red clump (RC) stars delivered as part of
this ﬁnal data release, below are our main results.

1. We calibrated our asteroseismic values to be on the
Gaia parallactic scale. The radius and mass coef-
ﬁcients, κR and κM , that are released in K2 GAP
DR3 need only be multiplied by a temperature-
dependent factor according to the user’s pre-
ferred temperatures to yield radii and masses.
The typical uncertainties in these coeﬃcients are
2.9% (stat.) ± 0.1% (syst.) & 6.7% (stat.) ±
0.3% (syst.)
in κR & κM for RGB stars and
4.7% (stat.) ± 0.3% (syst.) & 11% (stat.) ±
0.9% (syst.) for RC stars. All of the stars with
κR and κM are classiﬁed as red giant branch or
red clump stars, according to a machine-learning
approach.

2. Using injection tests, we estimate that our com-
pleteness in radius peaks for stars with R ∼ 10R(cid:12),

where our recovery rate is around 80%. There is a
sharp decline in completeness at smaller radii, and
a more gradual decline in completeness at larger
radii. We estimate a nearly uniform completeness
in mass space of ∼ 60%.

3. Injection tests suggest systematics of 1 − 3% may
arise due to the shorter time baseline of K2 com-
pared to Kepler, and take the form of both zero-
point biases and trends as a function of νmax, ∆ν,
and signal-to-noise ratio. These ﬁndings should
be informative for future studies using short–time
baseline TESS light curves, which would presum-
ably suﬀer from similar, if not more severe, sys-
tematics.

4. We derived ages with typical precisions of 20%
for a subset of the K2 GAP DR3 sample based
on GALAH metallicities and eﬀective tempera-
tures. In combination with GALAH abundances,
we compared observed age-abundance patterns
with those predicted by Kobayashi et al. (2020a) as
an independent check on the abundance evolution
of low- and high-α stars. We corroborate recent in-
ferences regarding the nucleosynthesis of α, light,
iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements based on
abundance ratios alone (e.g., Griﬃth et al. 2019).
Following similar indications from the Lin et al.
(2019) analysis of GALAH DR2 subgiants with
isochronal ages, we ﬁnd evidence for signiﬁcant
production of Eu at early times, consistent with
core-collapse supernovae as the predominant site
of r-process production. Our ﬁndings also suggest
mass-dependent Ba yields, in support of indica-
tions from D’Orazi et al. (2009).

Studies of Galactic chemical evolution stand to beneﬁt
enormously from a continued focus on considering age
and not just stellar abundances themselves, as we have
shown here. Indeed, ages are of crucial importance in
interpreting chemo-kinematic relations (Minchev et al.
2019) — particularly ages with the level of precision
reported here (e.g., Martig et al. 2014). As the largest
asteroseismic dataset in the literature, K2 GAP DR3
will prove useful not only for Galactic studies, but also
for testing stellar models using the sample’s evolutionary
state classiﬁcations coupled with its accurate and precise
asteroseismic masses and radii.
