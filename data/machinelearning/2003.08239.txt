ABSTRACT  Having  a  cognitive  and  self-optimizing  network  that  proactively  adapts  not  only  to  channel 
conditions, but also according to its users’ needs can be one of the highest forthcoming priorities of future 6G 
Heterogeneous  Networks  (HetNets).  In  this  paper,  we  introduce  an  interdisciplinary  approach  linking  the 
concepts of e-healthcare, priority, big data analytics (BDA) and radio resource optimization in a multi-tier 5G 
network. We employ three machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, naïve Bayesian (NB) classifier, logistic 
regression (LR), and decision tree (DT), working as an ensemble system to analyze historical medical records 
of stroke out-patients (OPs) and readings from body-attached internet-of-things (IoT) sensors to predict the 
likelihood of an imminent stroke. We convert the stroke likelihood into a risk factor functioning as a priority 
in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Hence, the task is to optimally allocate 
physical  resource  blocks  (PRBs)  to  HetNet  users  while  prioritizing  OPs  by  granting  them  high  gain  PRBs 
according to the severity of their medical state. Thus, empowering the OPs to send their critical data to their 
healthcare provider with minimized delay. To that end, two optimization approaches are proposed, a weighted 
sum  rate  maximization  (WSRMax)  approach  and  a  proportional  fairness  (PF)  approach.  The  proposed 
approaches increased the OPs’ average signal to interference plus noise (SINR) by 57% and 95%, respectively. 
The  WSRMax  approach  increased  the  system’s  total  SINR  to  a  level  higher  than  that  of  the  PF  approach, 
nevertheless, the PF approach yielded higher SINRs for the OPs, better fairness and a lower margin of error.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Brain  strokes  are  one  of  the  rising  health  issues  and 
though they might cause significant disabilities to the patient, 
immediate  treatment  can  effectively  increase  recovery 
chances [1]. According to statistics from England, Wales and 
Northern Ireland for 2016-2017, one-third of stroke patients 
arrived  at  the  hospital  unaware  of  the  date  and  time  their 
symptoms began. The severity of this matter is even starker 
when  knowing  that  the  average  waiting  time  for  a  patient 
from  the  start  of  symptoms  until  hospital  admission  is  7.5 
hours, with an additional 55 minutes for door-to-needle time 
(the time between arriving at an emergency department and 
having  an  anesthetic  administered).  Adding  to  all  that,  the 
patient  is  loses  1.9  million  neurons  each  minute  until  the 
treatment begins [2]. Thus, a proactive and timely diagnosis 
is vital. Big data analytics (BDA) and machine learning (ML)

methods can be optimally utilized to  process  disparate data 
such as patient’s electronic health record (EHR), diet, genetic 
data and their daily routine, and produce a quick and accurate 
diagnosis  supporting  medical  personnel  [3].  Thus,  saving 
lives,  improving  the  level  of  care,  and  lowering  costs.  An 
example  of  using  BDA  in  healthcare  is  reported  by  the 
Medical Centre at Columbia University, where BDA is used 
to  diagnose  complications  suffered  from  bleeding  stroke 
caused  by  ruptured  brain  aneurysms.  Using  physiological 
data,  complications  were  indicated  48  hours  in  advance, 
giving  the  medical  staff  sufficient  time  to  treat  the 
complications  [4].  Given  its  importance  in  saving  people's 
lives, the last five years witnessed a growing interest in the 
subject  of  using  ML  algorithms  for  stroke  prediction  as 
illustrated in Fig. 1.

II.   Related Work 

Our  proposed  system  is  of  an  interdisciplinary  nature 
spanning the use of machine learning and big data analytics 
in cellular network design. In particular it is concerned with 
the  use  of  machine  learning  and  big  data  analytics  in 
healthcare,  particularly,  disease  prediction  and  hence 
applying  the  knowledge  gained  in  the  design  of  cellular 
wireless system. Therefore, we investigate both parts in this 
section. This section concludes with a third part highlighting 
the  proposed  link  between  the  former  two  parts  where  we 
infused the two subjects by proposing a system that optimizes 
the uplink of a HetNet considering the intrinsic needs of the 
human users, in this case, their medical state. 

  Using  machine  learning/big  data  analytics  in 

network design/optimization 

Significant  effort  is  dedicated  currently  to  endowing 
wireless  networks  with  the  ability  to  seamlessly  prioritize 
cellular  users  to  serve  them  accordingly.  Utilizing  big  data 
analytics for network design was thoroughly discussed in our 
survey  paper  where  we  observed  that  the  wireless  field 
received  the  highest  level  of  attention  in  this  area  [8]. 
Optimizing  the  resource  allocation  within  the  network  can 
focus  on  several  areas,  such  as  spectrum  allocation 
optimization,  beamformer  design,  power  optimization, 
backhaul management, computing resource optimization, and 
cache optimization. In this paper, we will concentrate on the 
spectrum allocation due to its relevance to our present work. 
The  authors  in  [9]  employed  a  genetic  algorithm  (GA)  and 
support  vector  machines  (SVM)  and  proposed  a  network 
planning tool. They proposed a metric which is the number of 
physical resource block per Megabit (i.e., PRB/Mb) and their 
target  was  to  maintain  the  quality  of  service  (QoS)  while 
minimizing  that  metric.  Having  a  faster  dynamic  spectrum 
allocation decision in a cloud-based radio access network (C-
RAN) was the goal of the authors in [10]. They proposed the 
use of regression analysis applied to big data collected from a 
monitoring  system  at  Sofia  Airport  to  predict  the  spectrum 
occupancy and usage activity in predefined frequency bands. 
Optimizing the spectrum allocation, peer discovery, and route 
selection from a delay perspective was the goal of the authors 
in  [11].  They  predicted  the  vehicle  trajectories  using 
interacting  multiple  model  (IMM)  estimation  and  a  multi-
Kalman  filter  (MKF)  operating  on  big  data  generated  by 
geographic  positioning  system  (GPS)  and  geographic 
information  system  (GIS).  Game  theory  is  used  in  the

field of machine learning 

The topic of remote out-patient (OP) monitoring is largely 
dependent on two factors; precise medical Internet of Things 
(IoT) sensors and a reliable network connection to convey the 
relevant data. A cellular connection is preferred over Wi-Fi 
or  wired  connections  as  it  does  not  restrict  the  patient’s 
mobility.  Nevertheless,  cellular  connections  can  experience 
channel  fading  and  path  loss  where  the  connection  can 
become unreliable or cannot be established due to a very low 
signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). A slow fading 
channel may indicate that the signal level is inadequate at the 
instance(s)  when  an  OP’s  critical  data  must  be  conveyed 
urgently to the healthcare provider. 

In  this  work,  we  are  proposing  to  use  the  OP’s  data  to 
serve  a  dual  purpose.  In  addition  to  diagnostics,  it  would 
guide the network operator to the OPs with the most pressing 
needs. Hence, radio resources can be allocated to them. We 
contend that maintaining a high-quality connection between 
the  OP’s  medical  IoT  and  the  medical  provider  is  a  step 
towards  transforming  conventional  heterogeneous  networks 
into  a  cognitively-personalized  e-healthcare-
(HetNets) 
centric  service.  Building  self-adaptive,  intelligent,  and  self-
aware  network 
is  an  operator’s  high-level  objective. 
Therefore,  ML  can  endow  the  network  the  capability  of 
learning  from  experience  and  improving  its  performance. 
Therefore,  BDA  can  transform  the  network  from  being 
reactive  to  predictive  [5].  Topics  that  discusses  patient 
monitoring, radio resource allocation, prioritization, fairness, 
and ensemble-aided disease risk prediction are popular in the 
literature  across  several  disciplines.  However,  proposing  a 
HetNet  optimization  framework  that  incorporates  all  the 
above is, to the extent of our knowledge, unique. 

assignment 

The objective of both approaches presented in this work 
is to maximize the system’s overall SINR, both of which are 
governed by a number of power and physical resource block 
(PRB) 
constraints.  Nevertheless,  OP 
prioritization  is  implemented  in  the  assignment  process  by 
allocating  the  OPs  with  PRBs  of  gains  relative  to  their 
medical  state  (i.e.,  the  stroke  likelihood)  acquired  from  an 
ensemble system. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) 
extending our previous work in [6] to include a larger dataset, 
and  the  incorporation  of  new  ML  algorithms  including 
decision  tree  (DT),  logistic  regression  (LR),  and  the  ML 
algorithm we deployed in [6] (naïve Bayesian (NB) classifier) 
in  an  ensemble  system  where  a  soft  voting  (SV)  classifier

More  than  800  subjects  participated  in  the  research  in  [16] 
where  a  dataset  comprising  50  risk  factors  was  collected. 
KNN and C4.5 DT algorithms were used to analyze the data 
using a WEKA platform to predict stroke incidence. The C4.5 
DT algorithm returned the highest accuracy. The authors in 
[17] employed naïve Bayes, ANN, and DT methods and the 
DT reported the highest accuracy score. A proof-of-concept 
study was conducted in [18] to predict the outcome of stroke 
thrombolysis using SVM . It analyzed a sample of 116 brain 
CTs  and  clinical  records  and  compared  the  results  with 
prognostication tools. The results were in favor of the SVM. 
Predicting the intensive care unit (ICU) transfer decision for 
stroke in-patients was the target for the researchers in [19]. 
DT, SVM, ANN, and logistic regression (LR) ensemble were 
employed for that purpose. The results were then compared 
to a generalized boosted model (GBM). The results showed 
the  DT  to  have  a  higher  accuracy  than  the  other  models. 
However, the GBM ensemble showed a better result than the 
DT.  To  classify  the  type  of  stroke,  the  authors  of  [20] 
proposed to utilize case sheets for patients’ symptoms using 
data mining methods, namely, tagging and maximum entropy 
methodologies  and  machine  learning  to  classify  the  stroke 
type. Towards that end, the authors used SVM, boosting and 
bagging,  ANN,  and  random  forests  algorithms.  The  results 
showed that the ANN yielded higher classification accuracy 
than the rest of the algorithms.

  Using machine learning and big data analytics in 

healthcare and stroke prediction 

 Cardiovascular  disease 

(CVD)  prediction  using 
ML/BDA techniques has been comprehensively discussed in 
prior literature. The authors of [12] proposed an approach to 
help patients with Parkinson's disease. Given the fact that the 
loss of flexibility is a sign of disease progression, the authors 
proposed a system that analyzes big data collected from body 
and 3D sensors (e.g., Microsoft Kinect). This gives healthcare 
providers an opportunity to track treatment effectiveness and 
disease  development 
in  real-time.  The  authors  of  a 
comprehensive  study  in  [13]  employed  a  NB  classifier  to 
predict  heart  disease  problems.  The  same  classifier  was 
corroborated  by  a  number  of  cardiologists  in  [14]  and  the 
classifier’s accuracy had an agreement of more than 80% with 
the health outcomes of the respondents. K-nearest neighbor 
(KNN),  DT,  artificial  neural  networks  (ANN),  and  SVM 
algorithms were compared in [15] for the detection of small 
ischemic  stroke  in  brain  computerized  tomography  (CT)

Despite  the  highlighted  surge  in  the  literature  on  self-
optimized and ML-assisted network optimization, this prior 
research  is  still  heavily  reliant  on  either  terminal-level  or 
network-level features. Furthermore, the works presented are 
mostly agnostic to the users and their needs. A recent work 
presented  by  the  authors  in  [21]  proposed  a  human  brain-
aware  optimization  approach  to  allocate  radio  resources. 
They developed a probability distribution identification (PDI) 
learning  method  to  predict  the  delay  perceived  by  human 
users and quantify the reliability of this prediction. Based on 
a proposed closed-form expression linking wireless physical 
layer  metrics  and  reliability  measure,  and  by  using  a 
Lyapunov-based  brain-aware  optimization  approach  the 
authors were able to allocate radio resources to human users 
according to their delay perception. In a previous work, we 
proposed in [6]  the use of readings of blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic), total cholesterol levels and daily smoking rate 
acquired by non-invasive medical IoT sensors and train a NB 
classifier on the OP’s medical record to predict the likelihood 
of  a  stroke.  This  likelihood  is  then  feedback  as  a  priority 
factor in a radio resource optimization model for an LTE-A 
network guaranteeing the assignment of high-quality PRBs to 
the  OPs.  Furthermore,  we  extended  the  previous  work  to 
include multi-tier HetNets in [7] with a spectrum partitioning 
strategy  [22]  so  that  inter-tier  interference  is  mitigated. 
Moreover, the system response was investigated over seven 
different  current  states  resulting  in  different  priority  levels 
granted to the OPs. 

III. OP-Centric Network Optimization Framework 

In  this  section,  we  introduce  the  system  model,  before 
explaining the role of the machine learning algorithms and all 
of the stages of data preparation needed before the data can 
be  usable  in  the  proposed  model.  The  problem  formulation 
concludes 
the  main 
this  section,  where  we  present 
mathematical  equations  in  terms  of  objective  functions  and 
constraints. 

  System Model 

In this work, we consider a scenario of a HetNet consisting of 
a macro base station (MBS) and two neighboring pico base 
stations (PBS) operating in an urban environment. The MBS 
coverage range is a radius of 300-600 meters whilst the PBS 
has a coverage radius of 40-100 meters. In a previous work in 
[7],  we  assumed  the  adoption  of  a  spectrum  partitioning 
strategy [22] to mitigate the impact of inter-tier interference 
on the PBS users caused by the MBS users. In this work, we 
consider  the  effects  of  the  inter-tier  interference.  The  users 
belong to two categories: healthy (normal) users, and OPs as 
illustrated in Fig. 2 which shows a 6G HetNet scenario with 
BDA.  As  in  a  real-life  scenario,  the  users  are  randomly 
scattered  around  the  base  stations  at  different  distances 
resulting in different received power levels at the base station 
from connected UEs. If an OP is assigned a low-level SINR 
channel,  the  healthcare  provider  may  not  be  notified  in  an 
emergency and the response is thus delayed. Here, a patient 
suffering a stroke loses 1.9 million neurons per minute before 
the treatment starts [2]. Therefore, the objective is to assign 
high-gain PRBs to the OPs according to the severity of their

medical status (i.e., stroke likelihood). The latter is computed 
in  a  cloud-based  BDA  engine  according  to  the  procedure 
shown in Fig. 3. Thus, OPs that are prioritized over normal 
users  will  have  higher  spectral  efficiency  due  to  their  high 
SINR  values.  This,  in  turn,  will  achieve  higher  throughput 
(since  spectral  efficiency 
to 
throughput). Hence, the OPs will be able to send their data 
with minimal delay.

  Machine learning algorithms 

In this work, we use an ensemble system comprising three 
supervised learning classifiers, namely, a NB classifier, a DT 
classifier, and a LR classifier that work on the OP’s dataset 
and feed their predicted probabilities of stroke to a soft voting 
(SV) classifier.  Given  a  certain  feature  vector (representing 
the OP’s current state), each of the aforesaid classifiers yields 
a  probability  of  stroke.  Using  ensemble  learning,  those 
classifiers  can  be  combined  into  a  single  predictive  model 
with higher accuracy, and thus, higher confidence is achieved 
in the predicted results. 

Table I (A) shows a sample of the dataset (i.e., medical 
record) of a single OP. Feature variables 𝑓", …	𝑓& characterize 
the main contributors to a stroke stated in [23, 24] and they 
are  (Blood  Pressure  (BP),  Cholesterol  Level,  and  Smoking 
Rate). The Framingham cardiovascular cohort study  [25] is 
used  to  populate  the  dataset  of  the  individual  OPs.  The 
Framingham  study  contains  readings  for  more  than  3000 
persons.  Due  to  regulatory  and  privacy  reasons,  it  was  not 
possible for us to acquire cohort medical records belonging to 
several individual patients. Therefore, we segmented parts of 
the Framingham dataset in [26] to represent several OPs.

1)  Naïve Bayesian Classifier 
The  NB  classifier  is  a  probabilistic  statistical  classifier 
which uses a number of independent feature variables	𝑓* (e.g. 
total Cholesterol and Blood pressure levels) obtained from a 
historical dataset (i.e., the OP’s medical record) to determine 
the likelihood of an incident 𝑐 (i.e. a stroke) as shown in Fig. 
3.  The  classifier  is  termed  naïve  because  it  assumes  the 
feature  variables  are  unrelated  to  each  other  [31].  This 
classifier is chosen for the following reasons; (i) it has a track 
record in disease risk prediction as in [14] and [32],  (ii)  its 
low complexity incurs less computational burden, (iii) it is an 
ideal choice for any two-class concept with nominal features 
[33], (iv) it has proven accuracy in Cardio Vascular Disease 
(CVD) prediction compared to other approaches [34, 35], (v) 
it does not require large training datasets [36].  

The classifier’s posterior probability is given as

2)  Logistic Regression Classifier 

The main distinctions between the NB classifier and the LR 
classifier is that; (i) it is fast and can produce a large change 
in  response  to  the  feature  vector,  (ii)  it  allows  for  large 
discrimination (i.e., a change in one feature may cause large 
effect).  However,  this  also  means  that  it  suffers  from  high 
sensitivity to feature vector values. This classifier is a popular 
tool in disease prediction as in [19, 20, 37]. The logistic model 
is based on the logistic function given in (3). This function is 
zero when 𝑥 is -∞, whereas the function is 1 when 𝑥 is + ∞. 

𝑓 𝑥 =

1 + 𝑒:; 

(3) 

This  range  is  the  primary  reason  for  selecting  the  logistic 
model  to  estimate  the  probability.  The  index  of  combined 
features is 𝑥 and it is given as a linear sum as shown in (4). 

𝑥	 = 	 𝛽= 	 + 	 𝛽"𝑓" 	 + 	 𝛽’𝑓’+. . . +	𝛽5𝑓5

where	𝛽=	represents  the  𝑦  intercept  and  𝛽"	. . 𝛽5  are  the 
regression coefficients, 𝑓", …	𝑓@ depict the feature variables, 
and 𝑛 is the total number of features in the prediction model 
(in this work, 𝑛 = 4) [38]. The conditional probability can be 
written as:

the  conditional 
is		𝑃 𝐶 = 0 𝐹* = 	 𝑓* = 1 −

𝑃 𝐶 = 1 𝐹* = 	 𝑓* .  The  values  of  the  line  coefficients  (i.e., 
𝛽=	. . 𝛽5)  cannot  be  solved  analytically,  therefore,  we  used 
solvers to navigate the search space.

3)  Decision Trees Classifier  

The  DT  construction  procedure  is  done  by  splitting  the 
dataset  into  descendant  subsets.  The  splitting  continues  on 
repeated splits of the descendant subsets. The notion behind 
the tree methods is to have a set of partitions so that the best 
class can be determined. The partitions are performed so as to 
choose the splits in a way that guarantees that the leaves are 
purer  than  the  parent  node  [39].  DT  classifies  vectors  by 
sorting them, starting at the root of the tree down to some leaf 
nodes. In this tree, each node specifies a test of some input 
feature of the vector, and each branch descending from that 
node corresponds to one of the possible values for this feature 
[31].  The  reasons  for  choosing  DTs  are;  (i)  their  ability  to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
implicitly perform feature selection or variable screening [20, 
40, 41], (ii) they are uncomplicated to understand, interpret 
and,  visualise,  (iii)  tree  performance  is  not  affected  by 
nonlinear  relationships  between  parameters,  (iv)  their  track 
record in the stroke prediction literature as in [16, 17, 42].  

The purity is measured using a Gini index which is used as an 
attribute selection measure where the ranking per attribute is 
given. The feature (attribute) with the best score is selected as 
the splitting feature for the given data subset. Splitting is done

the total number of samples of all classes in a given leaf. 

4)  Ensemble model 
Ensemble  methods  train  multiple  learners  on  the  same 
dataset  to  classify  the  same  feature  vector(s).  The  original 
goal of using ensemble systems is comparable to the way a 
person seeks advice from several trusted individuals. Hence, 
this reinforces the confidence that the decision made was the 
right  one.  Similarly,  an  ensemble  of  classifiers  can  be 
employed  to  increase  the  classification  accuracy.  Ensemble 
systems  provide  a  method  to  incorporate  various  opinions, 
sometimes  weighing  them  differently  before  reaching  a 
concluding verdict. Individual classifiers may have different 
errors,  however,  they  generally  agree  in  terms  of  their 
classification  decision.  Therefore,  averaging  the  classifiers' 
outputs 
the  error  component, 
consequently  reducing  the  classification  error  [44,  45]  and 
balancing  out  the  individual  weaknesses  of  equally  well-
performing  models  [46].  The  ensemble  architecture  of  the 
soft  voting  (SV)  classifier  we  employed  in  this  work  is 
illustrated  in  Fig.  4.  The  NBC,  LR,  and  DT  serve  as  base 
classifiers and their probabilities are then averaged to produce 
the  voted  probability  denoted  by	𝑃nop*5q.  To  calculate  this 
probability, let the probability yielded by each base classifier 
𝐶𝐿𝐹*  given  in  (1),  (5),  and  (10)  be	𝑃lsYI,	𝑃lsYt  and	𝑃lsYu, 
respectively. Since all base classifiers are treated evenly, the 
SV classifier calculates the probability as in (11).

In order to provide weights to the MILP so that the OPs 
are assigned higher gain PRBs, a base user priority 𝑈𝑃w	of 1 
is assigned to normal users while OPs are assigned the base 
weight plus another weight derived from the multiplication of 
a weight parameter	𝛼 by the voted stroke likelihood 	𝑃nop*5q 
thus, granting an effective-yet-reasonable priority:

  Problem Formulation and Model Parameters 

Using our track record in MILP optimization in [6, 7, 47-
54], and physical layer modeling in [55-60], we developed the 
following  MILP  models  introduced  in  [6]  to  optimize  the 
cellular system resource allocation for OPs and normal users. 
We  consider  a  scenario  where  the  OPs  monitoring  system 
operates in a HetNet supported by 𝐵 base stations denoted by 
set	ℬ = 	 {1, … , 𝐵}  including  both  MBS  and  PBS  types, 
operating  at  channels  with  1.4  MHz  bandwidth.  Each  base 
station  𝑏  has  𝑁  PRBs  depicted  by  set	𝒩 = 	 {1, … , 𝑁}.  The 
network serves a total of 𝐾 users (normal and OPs) denoted 
by set 𝒦 = 1, … , 𝐾  by allocating PRB 𝑛 to connect to BS 
𝑏 in an instant in time. The goal is to optimize the uplink of 
the HetNet, so that the OPs are prioritized over healthy users; 
hence, allocating them high-gain PRBs. 

We  formulate  this  problem  as  a  MILP  model.  Table  III 
defines the sets, parameters, and variables used in the network 
optimization problem formulation.

a) 

Before Prioritizing the OPs 

The OPs’ risk factors introduced in the previous section are 
scaled into priorities (i.e. weights) and used to grant the OPs 
priority  over  other  users.  The  MILP  model  is  formulated  as 
follows: 

Objective: Maximize 

(cid:138)
𝑇w,5

𝑈𝑃w

w∈𝒦

5∈𝒩	

(cid:138)∈ℬ

(15) 

The  objective  in  (15)  targets  the  maximization  of  the 
weighted  sum  of  the  users’  SINRs.  The  OPs  have  higher 
weights  (i.e.  priorities)  than  other  healthy  users  and  these 
weights are relative to the OPs’ calculated risk factor.  

Note  that  all  the  users  share  the  same  initial  priority 
(i.e.,	𝑈𝑃w = 1)  as  in  (16).  However,  the  OPs  will  have 
updated  values  according  to  their  risk  factor.  This  will 
ultimately  drive  the  system  into  prioritizing  the  OPs  over 
healthy  users  during  PRB  assignment.  The  mathematical 
formulations  related  to  the  OP  weight  (priority)  calculation 
was illustrated in Section III.B.

Rewriting equation (13) gives a quadratic term resulting from 
(cid:147) 	and 
the  multiplication  of 
(cid:138) ).  Hence  we  follow  [62]  and  define  the 
Continuous	𝑇w,5
(cid:147),(cid:138)   that  comprises  all  the  indexes  of  both

𝑘  with  PRB  𝑛  connected  to  base  station  𝑏  if  there  is  an 
interfering user 𝑚 connected to the other base station 𝑤 with 
the same PRB 𝑛; otherwise, it is zero. Due to the introduction 
(cid:147),(cid:138) , it is imperative to linearize this term to solve the 
of		𝜙d,5,w
model using linear solvers such as CPLEX. Therefore, several 
linearization constraints are employed as given in [6]. 

We have developed three approaches to solve the resource 
allocation  problem.  The  first  approach,  named  WSRMax, 
uses an objective function that maximizes the Weighted Sum-
Rate  of  the  SINRs  experienced  by  the  users.  The  second 
approach  implements  fairness  among  cellular  users  by 
adopting  a  Proportionally  Fair  (PF)  objective  function.  The 
third  approach  integrates  the  second  approach  with  the 
concept of reliability. Thus, it is a reliability-aware PF where 
it sets an SINR threshold guaranteeing adequate QoS levels 
to normal users. 

1)  MILP Formulation for the WSRMax approach  
In  this  approach,  the  objective  is  to  maximize  the  system’s 
overall SINR. This can be done by maximizing the SINRs of 
individual users. 

8 

i-  That the sum of powers per PRB connection 𝑃 for each 
user does not exceed the maximum allocated power per 
uplink connection	𝑃𝑀. 

ii- That each PRB in each BS is to be utilized by a maximum 
of  one  UE  only,  while  each  UE  preserves  the  right  to 
utilize more than one PRB when possible. 

iii- Each  user  is  allocated  at  least  one  PRB  from  any  base 
station. Thus, no user is left without service. Furthermore, 
this  stops  the  MILP  from  blocking  interfering  users  to 
maximize the overall (network-wide) SINR. 

b) 

After Prioritizing the OPs 

In  this  approach,  OPs’  risk  factors  introduced  in  the 
previous section are scaled into weights to prioritize the OPs 
over other users. The MILP model is formulated in the same 
way  as  mentioned  in  the  previous  subsection.  However, 
equation (12) is included in this model to represent the OPs’ 
weights (i.e. priorities) while (16) is replaced by (17) to cover 
the normal users only, thus 

𝑈𝑃w = 1. 

∀	𝑘 ∈ 𝒦: 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑁𝑈 

(17) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2)  MILP Formulation for the PF approach  

Maximizing the logarithmic sum of the user’s SINRs is 
the objective in this approach. A slight decrease in the overall 
SINR  might  be  observed  (due  to  the  nature  of  the  natural 
logarithm) but with the added benefit of preserving fairness 
among normal users. 

a) 

Before Prioritizing the OPs 

All users, in this case, are treated evenly, thus there is no 
prioritization  in  allocating  the  radio  resources.  However, 
keeping fairness among users still holds as a necessity. Since 
the  only  part  that  we  are  dealing  with  is  the  value  of  the 
individual user’s SINR, and to simplify the manipulation of 
the  equation  before  adding  the  natural  logarithm,  we 
introduce the optimization variable	𝑆w, to serve as the SINR 
for each user	𝑘 as in [6], where the single-indexed variable	𝑆w 
substitutes the three-indexed variable	𝑇w,5

(cid:138)  as follows 

𝐿w = ln 𝑆w. 

∀	𝑘 ∈ 𝒦 

(18) 

  Calculating	𝐿w	  as  a  logarithmic  function  of  the  user’s 
SINR	𝑆w  is  carried  out  in  (18).  Since  the  natural  log  is  a 
concave function, and to maintain the linearity of our model, 
piecewise  linearization  was  employed  through  a  set  of 
constraints as in [6]. 

The objective of this approach is given in (19): 

Objective: Maximize 

𝐿w

w∈(cid:155)

Constraints: 

(19) 

In  addition  to  the  previously-mentioned  constraints,  the 
PF  approach  employs  a  set  of  piecewise  linearization 
relations  implemented  to  linearize  the  concave  function  in 
equation (18). It should be noted that these relations resemble 
the line equation	𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥 + ℎ where the line coefficients are 
selected  as  in  [63].  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  number  of 
constraints used in the linearization procedure is dictated by 
the total number of lines used to cover the linearized interval. 

b) 

After Prioritizing the OPs 

The outpatients are prioritized in this case, and equation 

(18) is rewritten to reflect the change. 

𝐿w = ln 𝑆w 

∀	𝑘 ∈ 𝒦: 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑁𝑈 

(20) 

Equation  (20)  shows  that  the  log  function  is  applied  to 
normal users only. The OPs, on the other hand, are assigned 
weights instead.

(21) 

The  multi-objective  function  in  (21)  (i)  Assigns  OPs 
priority  by  allocating  the  OPs  PRBs  with  high  SINRs 
reflecting their relative priority, (ii) maximizes the sum of the 
SINRs  assigned  to  all  users,  and  (iii)  achieves  fairness  by 
assigning healthy users PRBs with comparable SINRs. These 
objectives were implemented by adding both the summation 
of a log function of the healthy users’ SINRs (i.e. Proportional 
Fairness)  and  the  weighted  sum  of  the  OPs’  SINRs  (OPs 
priority). 

Constraints: 

The model satisfies the constraints of the previous model. 
In addition to equation (17) and the same set of equations for 
the piecewise linearization that was used before, however, the 
difference is in the range of users it is applied to (applied only 
to the normal users). 

3)  Calculating the Received Power  

The received signal power (in Watts) 𝑄w,5

(cid:138)  varies according 
to two elements, namely, the distance between the user and the 
BS and the channel conditions. The received signal power at 
the base station is given as

IV. Results and discussion 

We  consider  a  HetNet  serving  an  urban  environment, 
hence the Rayleigh fading channel model with path loss. The 
results  evaluate  two  scenarios;  the  first  depicts  the  HetNet 
state before prioritising the OPs. In this scenario, equal base 
priority (i.e., weight) of 1 is granted to all users. The second 
scenario  shows  the  HetNet  state  after  prioritising  the  OP 
through the updated priorities according to the value of the 
tuning factor 𝛼 and their voted stroke likelihood. 

A  cloud-based  arrangement  is  assumed  where  each  OP 
has  their  personal  dataset  constructed  from  their  medical 
history and daily observations over the course of 200 days, 
with  the  requirement  to  periodically  extend  the  dataset  by 
appending  recent  observations.  Moreover,  the  proposed 
approach  assumes  a  system  that  is  in  operation  and  the 
outpatient  is  being  assessed  by  the  voting  system  where 

 
 
 
 
 
 
	
 
 
 
multiple  classifiers  reside.  We  divided  our  dataset  into  two 
parts,  a  training  set  and  a  testing  set,  the  training  set 
comprised of 140 entries is used to train, i.e., fit the classifiers, 
and the test set with 60 entries is used to compare and verify 
the classifiers’ performance. Furthermore, we would like to 
bring to the reader’s attention that the ensemble’s role in this 
work is to report the soft-voted stroke likelihood. Since the 
outpatients  are  all  under  continuous  monitoring,  they  are 
favoured according to their probability of stroke as long as the

In  this  section,  we  investigate  the  performance  of  the 
methods described in the previous section. There are several 
performance metrics for ML algorithms and certain metrics 
are known by more than one name. Since we have a binary 
classification problem, we refer to a prediction as “positive” 
if a classifier predicted	𝑃 𝐶 = 𝑐 𝐹* = 	 𝑓* ≥ 0.5	, indicating 
the  occurrence  of  an  event  (e.g.,  stroke).  Alternatively,  if 
𝑃 𝐶 = 𝑐 𝐹* = 	 𝑓* < 0.5		then  the  classifier  predicted  a  no-
event  (e.g.,  no  stroke),  hence  is  translated  as  a  “negative” 
prediction.

performance,  we  use  a  test  dataset  of  60  entries  where  the 
outcome of all entries (i.e., feature vectors) are known (i.e., 
observed) 
the  prediction  results. 
Consequently,  there  will  be  four  outcomes;  (i)  a  correct 
positive  prediction,  named  true  positive  (TP),  indicating 
𝑃 𝐶 𝐹* ≥ 0.5 and an observed output of 1, (ii) an incorrect 
positive  prediction,  named  false  positive  (FP),  indicating 
𝑃 𝐶 𝐹* ≥ 0.5  and  an  observed  output  of  0,  (iii)  a  correct 
negative  prediction,  named  true  negative  (TN),  indicating 
𝑃 𝐶 𝐹* < 0.5  and  an  observed  output  of  0,  and  (iv)  an 
incorrect  negative  prediction,  named  false  negative  (FN), 
indicating 𝑃 𝐶 𝐹* < 0.5 and an observed output of 1. The 
following  metrics  are  computed  through  the  use  of  these 
outcomes.

3)  Specificity, True negative rate (TNR) 

Is  a  measure  of  the  classifier’s  ability  to  pick  the 
occurrence of a no-event of interest. In other words, it is the 
classifier’s ability to accurately identify actual negatives (i.e., 
stroke=0)  in  the  test  dataset.  Thus,  accurately  classify  an 
individual as risk-free.

4)  Precision, Positive-predictive value (PPV) 

Answers  the  question  of  how  many  of  those  who  we 
predicted as at risk are actually at risk? Thus, it is the ratio of 
accurate positive predictions to the total number of positively-
classified feature vectors, as in (29).

Precision is a vital measure when the FP's cost is high. In 
our  case,  this  corresponds  to  granting  a  high  priority  to  an 
outpatient that is not really in a high risk. 

5)  Negative-predictive value (NPV) 

NPV answers the question of how many of those who we 
predicted as at no risk are actually not at risk. Thus, it is the 
ratio of feature vectors accurately classified as negative (i.e., 
TN)  to  the  total  number  of  classifications  belonging  to 
class	𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑘𝑒 = 0, as denoted in (30).

8)  F1 Score 

(32) 

Defined as a function of both precision and recall values 
given in (29) and (27), respectively. This score is a measure 
of  the  balance  between  precision  and  recall  as  the  former 

 
 
highly focuses on true positives, whilst the latter focuses on 
true  negatives.  Thus,  providing  an  equal  weight  for  both 
precision and recall as it is the harmonic mean of the two as 
given in (33).

It  should  be  noted  that  since  there  are  three  separate 
datasets (one per outpatient), hence, there are not only four 
classifiers to investigate, but there is also a need to examine 
the  performance  of  these  classifiers  over  three  datasets  as 
illustrated in Table IV. 

The  proposed  SV  classifier  achieved  higher  accuracy 
compared to the other classifiers. Moreover, it had the lowest 
combined FPR and FNR which motivates its employment in 
this work. We further scrutinized the accuracy aspect of the 
proposed  SV  classifier  using  10-folds  cross-validation  and 
the  results  yielded  87.5%,  85.5%,  and  88.5%,  for  the  three 
data sets, respectively.

  Performance Metrics 

While it is important to scrutinize the classifiers at hand 
and  verify  their  performance,  however,  given  the  nature  of 
our work, there are several performance metrics that are more 
vital than others. Hence we highlight their importance in this 
section. Accuracy is an important metric in our work due to 
the  fact  that  it  gives  a  balanced  insight  on  the  classifier’s 
overall performance. FNR is the most important metric from 
the point of view of saving a patient’s life, i.e., it tells us the 
proportion of ill people who are miss-classified. The F1-score 
takes  misclassified  entries  (i.e.,  FP  and  FN)  into  account. 
Depending  on  the  application,  it  can  be  as  important  as 
accuracy in our case. 

Before proceeding into the results of the MILP model, it 

is worth noting that we used the parameters in Table V.

  The WSRMax Approach 

1)  Before Prioritizing the OPs 

This scenario considers the operation of a HetNet where 
all users share the same base user weight (i.e. priority) of 1. 
The  results  in  Fig.  6.  indicate  that  the  OPs  (represented  by 
users  8,  9,  and  10)  are  assigned  PRBs  of  comparable  gains 
resulting in near-average SINRs. This is due to the fact that 
the MILP’s aim is to maximize the HetNet’s overall SINR. In 
order  to  measure  fairness,  we  considered  emphasizing  the 
Standard  Deviation  (SD)  of  the  users’  SINRs,  hence,  to 
quantify  how  close  the  calculated  SINR  values  are  to  the 
mean, in this case, the SD was 195. Moreover, an extensive 
sensitivity analysis was carried out for the 300 independent 
realizations  of  the  channel  and  the  results  with  95% 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
confidence  intervals  per  user  are  indicated  in  Fig.  6.  The 
average SINR lied between 2166 and 2691. 

FIGURE 5. User SINR before OP Prioritization 
(WSRMax Approach) 

2)  After Prioritizing the OPs 

to 

the  OPs  according 

The  goal  in  this  scenario  is  to  utilize  BDA/ML  to 
prioritize  the  OPs  over  normal  users  by  means  of  the 
ensemble  system.  As  a  result,  high  gain  PRBs  will  be 
their  risk  factor 
allocated 
guaranteeing them high-level SINRs. Comparing Fig. 6. and 
Fig. 7. clearly highlights that the OPs (i.e., users 8, 9, and 10) 
were  granted  PRBs  with  high  SINRs.  The  overall  system 
performance  is  a  trade-off  (optimally-selected)  between 
guaranteeing the assignment of high SINRs to the OPs versus 
decrease in the average SINR (between 2% ( ∝= 1) and 19% 
(∝= 10) in comparison to the SINR in the first scenario.  

to 

8, and 10, the average SINR witnessed an increase from 17% 
(𝛼 = 1) to 57% (𝛼 = 10) granting this user an average SINR 
higher than all users. Individual users had an average SINR 
ranging from 1042 to 3776 for	𝛼 = 10. 

3)  The Impact of α on Fairness and SINR 

The parameter 𝛼 is a tuning factor that is used to convert 
the  minute  value  of  the  voted  probability  (i.e.,𝑃nop*5q)  of 
stroke acquired from the ensemble system to a risk factor as 
depicted in equation (12). Moreover, this parameter enables 
the reciprocity between the average SINR and the attainable 
fairness  among  the  users  quantified  by  the  SD.  We  used 
different values of 𝛼 to study the effects on the SD and the 
average  SINR.  We  examined  the  effects  of  using  different 
vales of 𝛼 on the SD and the average SINR as shown in Fig. 
8. and in Fig. 9. 

Increasing the value of 𝛼	forced the system to concentrate 
on  the  OPs.  Accordingly,  the  system’s  overall  SINR  was 
optimally  traded-off  to  increase  the  OPs’  SINRs  while 
minimally impacting fairness among users as shown in Fig. 
8.  It  should  be  noted  that  examining  the  OPs’  SINRs  and 
comparing them against their corresponding risk factor values 
reveals an increase in the SINR in an order conforming to that 
depicted  in  Fig.  9,  where  the  PRB  assignment  granting  the 
highest SINR was allocated to user 9 which is the user with 
the highest risk factor (priority). Furthermore, user 8 which 
has the lowest risk factor among the three OPs was given the 
lowest SINR among the OPs and very close to the system’s 
average SINR. As the value of 𝛼 increased (i.e., 𝛼 = 5, 10), 
user 8 is granted higher SINRs in comparison to other healthy 
users. 

FIGURE 7. Effects of changing α on average SINR 
and fairness (WSRMax Approach) 

FIGURE 6. User SINR after OP Prioritization 
(WSRMax Approach) 

The reason behind the reduction in the average SINR is 
because the system was forced to a PRB assignment scheme 
where  the  maximization  of  the  OPs’  individual  SINRs  is 
prioritized  over  the  total  SINR.  Fairness  between  normal 
users  was  marginally  impacted  in  this  approach  as  will  be 
shown in the following subsection. The impact of converting 
the  probability  of  stroke  to  a  risk  factor  and  using  several 
values  of  the  tuning  factor  (i.e.	𝛼 = 1,2,5	𝑎𝑛𝑑	10)  can  be 
observed  by  comparing  the  increase  in  the  OPs’  average 
SINRs. Taking the case of user 9 (the most critical user with 
a probability of 0.84) having an SINR lower than users 1, 3,

FIGURE 8. The impact of α, both user and average 
SINR (WSRMax Approach) 

  The PF Approach 

1)  Before Prioritizing the OPs 

In this scenario, the goal is to maximize the logarithmic 
sum of the user’s SINRs. Thus, no priority is given to any user 
in particular. Fairness is applied as a consequence due to the 
nature of the natural log in the objective function in (19). The 
results  depicted  in  Fig.  10.  are  in  agreement  with  the  ones 
depicted in Fig. 6.  

FIGURE 10. User SINR after OP Prioritization in 
linear Scale (PF Approach) 

The healthy users were noticeably affected by the intrinsic 
nature of the natural log, and the exclusion of the OPs from 
the  logarithmic  term  in  the  objective  function  resulted  in 
granting the healthy users lower SINRs in comparison to the 
OPs’  SINRs.  Fig.  12.  depicts  the  average  users’  SINR  in  a 
logarithmic scale where narrower confidence intervals can be 
observed in this approach. 

FIGURE 9. User SINR before OP Prioritization (PF 
Approach) 

However,  a  46%  reduction  in  the  SD  is  observed  when 
comparing  this  scenario  and  the  one  in  Subsection  IV.B.1. 
The  average  SINR  ranged  between  1905  and  2251. 
Sensitivity  analysis  was  implemented  over  300  different 
realizations of the HetNet. The results with a 95% confidence 
interval are illustrated in Fig. 10.  

2)  After Prioritizing the OPs 

In this approach, the OPs are prioritized according to their risk 
factors  using  the  objective  function  in  (21).  Therefore,  the 
OPs are granted high-gain PRBs resulting in high SINRs as 
illustrated in Fig.11. The OPs’ SINRs were boosted by up to 
95% observed by user 9 with	𝛼 = 10 . However, the average 
system SINR ranged between 1093 (𝛼 = 1) and 1113 (𝛼 =
10). 

FIGURE 11. User SINR after OP Prioritization in 
logarithmic Scale (PF Approach) 

3)  The Impact of α on Fairness and SINR 

Increasing the OPs’ priority by adjusting the tuning factor 
𝛼  has  similar  effects  to  the  ones  observed  in  the  previous 
subsection. Using the PF approach, boosts the OPs’ SINRs by 
up  to  95%,  but  has  resulted  in  reducing  the  overall  system 
SINR  by  up  to  48%  while  maintaining  a  good  fairness 
interpreted  as  a  stable  and  very  low  SD  as  illustrated  in 
Fig.13. Observing Fig. 14, it can be clearly seen that the OPs’ 
are  granted  SINRs  approximately  three  times  the  system’s 
average  SINR.  Furthermore,  the  analogy  between  the 
priorities (weights) granted to the OPs and the corresponding 
increase in their SINRs is highlighted.

FIGURE 12. Effects of changing α on average SINR 
and fairness (PF Approach) 

It  should  be  noted  that  user  9,  despite  having  a  higher 
priority  than  user  10,  was  assigned  a  PRB  with  SINR  very 
close to the SINR of user 10 when	𝛼 = 1	, 2. This is due to 
the fact that user 10 has already better channel conditions than 
user 9 as indicated in Fig. 10. Thus, it would require higher 
values of the tuning factor 𝛼 to bias the system towards user 
9 and this can be seen in 𝛼 = 5	and	10 in Fig. 14.  

FIGURE 13. The impact of α, both user and average 
SINR (PF Approach) 

  The Reliability-aware PF Approach 

In this approach, we are enhancing the SINR values for 
the  normal  users  that  are  impacted  by  the  logarithmic  sum. 
This is done by setting a minimum SINR where the users that 
are  subjected  to  this  constraint  have  guaranteed  reliable 
service levels [65]. 

1)  Before Prioritizing the OPs 

This  approach  shares  the  same  objective  of  the  PF 
approach in Section IV.D.1. However, a constraint is added 
to the model guaranteeing a minimum SINR of 21 dB for all 
users. The results depicted in Fig. 15 show a similar trend to 
the  ones  illustrated  in  Fig.  10.  However,  preserving  a 
minimum SINR level with no prioritization means that there 
is  a  slight  impact  on  the  system-wide  SINR.  Thusly,  we 
observed a 5% decrease in the system’s average SINR for the 
PF approach before and after introducing reliability. Here 

14

2)  After Prioritizing the OPs 

The  impact  of  the  natural  logarithm  on  healthy  users 
motivated  the  inclusion  of  a  constraint  guaranteeing  the 
minimum SINR level as in [65]. This results in an additional 
level of reliability with fairness in the PF approach, and here

The OPs’ SINRs are boosted by up to 23% observed by

reduced  in  comparison  with  the  previous  scenario  before 
introducing reliability as shown in Fig. 11. The results show 
narrower  confidence  intervals  than  under  the  WSRMax 
approach indicating a further reduction in the error values.

Introducing  the  reliability  aspect  to  the  PF  approach 
resulted  in  improving  the  system’s  average  SINR  with  a 
marginal  increase  in  the  SD.  However,  better  fairness  is 
observed when increasing the tuning factor	𝛼 as indicated in 
Fig. 17. Furthermore, the average SINR is increased by 32% 
in  comparison  to  the  reliability-unaware  PF  approach.  The 
OPs’ SINRs witnessed a 30% increase when employing the 
reliability-aware PG approach as shown in Fig. 18. Moreover, 
the  OPs  were  granted  SINRs  that  are  approximately  70% 
higher than the system’s average SINR

V.   CONCLUSIONS 

This work introduced two interdisciplinary approaches to 
transform  conventional  HetNets  in  6G  by  endowing  them 
with a user-centric machine learning dimension. To that end, 
a  BDA-powered  framework  was  proposed  to  play  part  in 
uplink radio resource allocation optimization of HetNets. The 
target is to prioritize stroke outpatients within the HetNet to 
provide them with the optimal wireless resources. Moreover, 
the assigned resources should be proportional to the severity 
of the patients’ medical state (i.e., stroke likelihood), which is 
predicted  using  an  ensemble  system  classifying  readings  of 
vital  signs  acquired  from  body-attached  and  nearby  IoT 
sensors. Two approaches, namely, the WSRMax and the PF 
are presented and compared in terms of fairness and in terms 
of the average SINR (both at the system and the user level). 

15 

The WSRMax approach enhanced the OP’s average SINR by 
up to 57%, whereas the PF approach improved the SINR by 
up to 95%. Depending on the value of tuning factor	𝛼, normal 
users  reported  an  average  SINR  ranging  between  2163  and 
1263  using  the  WSRMax  approach,  while  the  reliability-
aware PF approach attained an SINR ranging from 1089 to 
1066  (depending  on	𝛼).  Using  the  SD  to  quantify  fairness 
among  users,  the  WSRMax  scored  between  104  and  156, 
while  the  reliability-aware  PF  approach  ranged  between  44 
and  74.  Furthermore,  to  add  confidence  in  the  estimated 
probability of stroke, the ensemble system is examined and 
the  voting  classifier  yielded  up  to  93%  accuracy,  a  false 
positive rate of 2.8% and a false negative rate of 11%.
