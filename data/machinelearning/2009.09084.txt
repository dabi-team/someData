Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an urgent, prevalent, and under-detected public health is-
sue. We present machine learning models to assess patients for IPV and injury. We train the
predictive algorithms on radiology reports with 1) IPV labels based on entry to a violence
prevention program and 2) injury labels provided by emergency radiology fellowship-trained
physicians. Our dataset includes 34,642 radiology reports and 1479 patients of IPV victims
and control patients. Our best model predicts IPV a median of 3.08 years before violence
prevention program entry with a sensitivity of 64% and a speciﬁcity of 95%. We conduct
error analysis to determine for which patients our model has especially high or low perfor-
mance and discuss next steps for a deployed clinical risk model.

1. Introduction

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is deﬁned as physical, sexual, psychological, or economic
violence that occurs between former or current intimate partners. While men can also be
aﬀected, IPV is a gendered phenomenon largely perpetrated against women by male partners.1
The Centers for Disease Control report that more than 1 in 3 women, and 1 in 10 men
in the U.S. will experience physical violence, sexual violence, psychological violence, and/or
stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime.2 IPV victims have a greater risk of
health problems including higher rates of mental health illnesses, chronic pain, reproductive
diﬃculties, and generally poorer health.3–5 According to the United Nations, half of the women

who are intentionally killed globally are killed by their intimate partners or family members.6
It is essential to detect IPV victims early to provide timely intervention.

Healthcare providers have the opportunity to screen patients for IPV, but several barriers
at both patient and provider levels limit the eﬀectiveness. IPV victims often seek treatment
within healthcare settings;7 however, despite its high prevalence, IPV is substantially under-
diagnosed due to underreporting of violence by the victim to health care providers. Because
IPV victims generally do not present with obvious trauma, even in emergency departments,8
they do not readily receive IPV-speciﬁc resources.

Imaging studies provide an objective measurement of patient status, especially for vulnera-
ble individuals who are not forthcoming.9 In a prior observational study, researchers identiﬁed
IPV-related injury patterns including soft-tissue and musculoskeletal injuries from imaging
studies of victims who visited the emergency department. They also found that IPV victims
receive more radiology studies than a comparable control cohort.10

In this work, we present algorithms to predict IPV and injury from radiology reports. We
predict IPV from a dataset of 24,131 radiology reports from 262 IPV victims who enrolled into
a violence prevention support program and 794 controls from the same hospital who were age
and sex-matched based on a subset of the IPV victims. We demonstrate strong quantitative
results with our best model achieves a mean area under the received operator curve (AUC)
of 0.852. With a sensitivity of 64% and a speciﬁcity of 95%, we are able to predict IPV a
median of 3.08 years in advance of entry into the violence prevent support program. To better
detect severe forms of IPV, we predict injury from a dataset of radiology reports from only
IPV victims with labels from four emergency radiology fellowship-trained radiologists. Our
best model achieves a mean AUC of 0.887.

We analyze our models for validity and usability. Because IPV can manifest diﬀerently
across race,11 gender,12 age,13 and marital status,14 we present error analysis comparing accu-
racy, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity across these groups using demographic information extracted
from the clinical record. As IPV continues to aﬀect vulnerable individuals—especially in times
of great crisis15,16—we demonstrate how automated predictive algorithms can be used to iden-
tify patients at high risk of IPV and injury.

2. Related Work

2.1. Intimate partner violence

Early detection in IPV is critical to facilitate early intervention in the cycle of abuse, thereby
preventing worsening health conditions,3–5 life threatening injuries, and potentially homi-
cides.17 The main obstacle to early intervention is underreporting by the patient due to variety
of factors including shame, economic dependency, or lack of trust in healthcare providers.18
Automated screening can help physicians identify high risk individuals—potentially from ra-
diology studies,19 substance abuse disorders,20 or other clinical data—and intervene quickly.
Prior work has focused on analyzing associative patterns among IPV victims.10 To our knowl-
edge, we present the ﬁrst work to present an algorithm for IPV and injury prediction.

2.2. Clinical prediction

Machine learning methods can assess patients and other individuals for diﬀerent levels of risk
to allocate resources and improve clinical workﬂows.21,22 The strength of machine learning lies
in its ability to learn latent patterns from observational data and make robust predictions
on new and previously unseen patients. Researchers have shown promising results about the
use of machine learning on chronic diseases like diabetes,23 diagnosis from radiology reports,24
rare conditions like preterm infant illnesses,25 and public health concerns like child welfare.26,27
In particular, supervised learning models excel in structured settings with large datasets and
clearly deﬁned labels, e.g. radiology report text and whether the patient ultimate enters a
violence prevention program.

2.3. Natural language processing

Natural language processing (NLP) techniques can extract information from unstructured
text.28 In healthcare settings, researchers have leveraged NLP on clinical text such as nursing
notes, discharge summaries, and radiology and pathology reports for disease surveillance,24,29
cohort creation,30,31 prediction of adverse events,32–34 and diagnosis.35,36

A promising new area of natural language processing research is the use of contextual
word embeddings. Whereas traditional approaches represent text as a non-sequential bag of
words or a sequence of static word embeddings, more recent approaches construct unique rep-
resentations for each word (or sub-word) depending on its surrounding context. For instance,
the abbreviation “MS” may refer to mitral stenosis or multiple sclerosis depending on the
surrounding context. BERT,37 RoBERTa,38 AlBERT,39 and numerous other recent models
are pretrained on large amounts of text using language modelling objectives and then ﬁne-
tuned on a smaller task-speciﬁc dataset. Among other examples, large open-source clinical
datasets40 have enabled researchers to release clinical contextual word embedding models.
ClinicalBERT is a publicly available BERT model initialized from BioBERT41 and further
trained on intensive care unit notes.42

3. Dataset

We predict IPV using a dataset of IPV victims and age-matched control patients. We predict
injury using a dataset of only IPV victims, with labels from emergency radiologists.

3.1. IPV patient selection

The study cohort consisted of victims who were referred to a large academic hospital’s violence
prevention support program between January 2013 and June 2018. For the early detection of
IPV through IPV prediction, we randomly selected 265 women reporting physical abuse. We
excluded all victims without any radiological studies from both groups because our algorithm
seeks to predict IPV from radiology reports. The ﬁnal IPV dataset consists of 262 patients.

For injury prediction, we examine a wider set of patients from two groups of victims referred
to a large academic hospital’s violence prevention support program between January 2013 and
June 2018. For the ﬁrst group, we randomly selected 940 victims out of 2948 reporting any

type of IPV-physical, psychosocial, or sexual. The second group comprised of all 308 IPV
victims (including 265 women) reporting physical abuse. We excluded all victims without any
radiological studies from both groups. The ﬁnal IPV dataset consists of 530 patients.

3.2. Control group selection

We age-matched against 265 women with physical abuse and ﬁltered for patients with at least
one radiology study that was not canceled. We selected the ﬁrst 795 of the resulting 1006
patients to build our control cohort. Note that the control cohort was matched against the
265 female IPV victims and does not contain any men.

3.3. Injury labels

The full set of radiological studies and reports of the injury prediction patient cohort were ana-
lyzed for the presence of injury for each study. Any radiological ﬁndings unrelated to potential
physical injury such as pancreatitis, malignancy, subarachnoid hemorrhage due to aneurysm
rupture, etc. were not recorded as “injury”. All images were reviewed by four emergency radi-
ology fellowship-trained radiologists who were aware of history of IPV but were blinded to the
date of identiﬁcation of IPV and clinical notes. The readers had full access to the radiology
reports. The radiologists also recorded any injuries such as soft tissue swelling, rib fracture,
etc. which might be overlooked or not mentioned in the original radiology reports. Each report
was reviewed separately and labeled with an injury or not. Of the 15,639 radiology reports
reviewed, 2.57% of them were found to have an injury.

3.4. Data cleaning

For each radiology report, we remove extraneous information to improve clarity for the pre-
dictive models. We remove all header and footer information, punctuation, and line breaks.
We change the text to lowercase and create tokens from each word through bag of words or
clinicalBERT.42 Radiology reports that lack meaningful information after this cleaning are
removed from the dataset. Patients who do not have any radiology reports after this step are
removed from the dataset completely.

3.5. Demographic data

We extract demographic data from IPV victims and controls including age, gender, race, and
marital status. To structure free-form responses for some ﬁelds, we consolidate each ﬁeld into
several categories. For age, we discretize the ﬁeld into < 30, 30-50, 51-65, and 66+. The average
age of patients in dataset is 43.8 ± 18.5, with IPV victims average age at 40.9 ± 13.3 and control
population average age at 46.3 ± 4.7. For race, we consider white, Black, Hispanic, and “other”
categories with patients allowed to belong to more than one group. For marital status, we
categorize single, married, and other. Note that because our control population was sex and
age-matched against a cohort of female IPV victims, our control population contains no men.
We do not use demographic information for predictions and use only radiology reports. For
summary statistics about the dataset, see Table 1.

4. Methodology

4.1. Experiment setup

We train our models on 60% of the patients, validate and select hyperparameters based on 20%
of the patients, and report test performance on 20% of the patients. To avoid data leakage,
we split our data based on patient rather than radiology study. Once a patient is assigned to
train, validation, or test dataset, we assign all radiology reports and labels for that patient to
the corresponding dataset. We perform analysis on ﬁve trials with shuﬄed splits of the data.
All models are compared against the same ﬁve dataset splits.

4.2. Models

We compare two tasks and ﬁve models. We predict IPV and injury based on collected labels.
We consider data from extracted demographic data, radiology reports, and a combination of
the two. We use logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosted trees, neural network with
bag of words representation, and neural network with clinicalBERT42 representation.

For logistic regression, we search over hyperparameters including regularization constant
C = [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1., 2., 5.] and regularization type of L1 or L2. For random forest, we search
over maximum depth of trees of 10, 50, 100, 500, or no maximum depth. For gradient boosted
trees, we search over hyperparameters learning rate of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, or 1 and maximum depth

of 2, 3, and 4. We use the sklearn-learn Python package43 with otherwise default settings.

We train two neural network models using the AllenNLP library.44 Both models contain
an embedding layer followed by two feed forward layers with rectiﬁed linear unit function and
linear activations. The ﬁrst model represents each note as a vector of word frequencies (“Bag
of Words”) projected down to a lower dimensional vector while the second model leverages
clinicalBERT’s contextual word embeddings to represent each note.

To facilitate more rapid training on CPUs, we freeze the clinicalBERT embeddings and
only train the feed forward layers. The ﬁrst model was trained for 40 epochs with an early
stopping patient of 5 epochs, and the second model was trained for 10 epochs due to computa-
tional constraints. Gradient norms were rescaled to a max of 5.0, and training examples were
batched by note length to minimize excess padding. Hyperparameters were selected according
to validation set performance, resulting in a learning rate of 0.001, weight decay of 0.0001 and
batch size of 32 for both models.

4.3. Evaluation

4.3.1. Prediction and predictive features

We report the predictive performance as the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC)
on the same train, validation, and test datasets for all models compared. We compute AUC
means and standard deviations for the test datasets of the ﬁve shuﬄed splits of the data.

We present predictive features by ﬁnding words with high feature importance. Because
many compared models are non-linear, it is diﬃcult to use interpretability methods to ﬁnd
predictive words. As logistic regression performance is comparable to that of other other non-
linear methods (see Table 2), we present linear coeﬃcients of the logistic regression across ﬁve
test sets of the shuﬄed splits of the data.

4.3.2. Error analysis

As clinical models face high stakes decisions, it is important that machine learning reduce
health disparities45 rather than amplify existing biases.46 We audit our best prediction model
for IPV and injury by comparing accuracy, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity for diﬀerent subgroups
including age, race, gender, and marital status.47–49 We compute means and standard devi-
ations of performance metrics for each subgroup with model sensitivity set to 0.95 because
the clinical healthcare system can accommodate many false positives—e.g. oﬀering a conver-
sation with a social worker—whereas false negatives can be more dire—e.g. not providing an
IPV victim with additional resources for help. Predicted probabilities are computed for test
datasets and compared to the true labels for the ﬁve shuﬄed splits of the data.

4.3.3. Report-program date gap

One practical measure of IPV prediction is how much earlier does our model predict IPV
compared to the date of patient entry into a violence prevention program. Although some
patients may be reluctant to seek clinical assistance,18 earlier detection and appropriate triage
of IPV victims can help empower clinicians to intervene and provide better care for victims.19

For each radiology report, we compare the radiology report date with the entry date into
the program. We call this diﬀerence in dates the report-program date gap, or simply the date
gap. Negative date gaps denote reports that occur before program entry. A radiology report
with a large magnitude date gap is one that occurs long before program entry whereas a low
magnitude date gap occurs shortly before program entry. A model that can make predictions
with a large magnitude date gap per IPV victim would allow us to allocate resources and
support to high risk individuals more eﬃciently. For each IPV victim, we compute the largest
date gap for which the model predicts IPV above the chosen threshold.

We select the prediction threshold to satisfy speciﬁcity constraints. A trivial way to max-
imize the early IPV detection would be to predict IPV for every patient in the dataset. This
simpliﬁcation would yield redundant results and a high sensitivity (true positive rate). Ac-
cordingly, we ﬁx our speciﬁcity level (true negative rate) to be at least 95% and compute the
corresponding model threshold. We report the median earliest date gap for all IPV victims
for whom the model predicts correctly.

5. Results

5.1. IPV and injury prediction and predictive features

We are able to predict IPV (best mean AUC of 0.852, random forest classiﬁer) and injury (best
mean AUC of 0.887, random forest classiﬁer). For more results, see Table 2. We ﬁnd that words
that are most predictive for IPV and injury match clinical literature in IPV injury patterns
from radiology reports. In Table 3, we show words with highest feature importance from
logistic regression for both tasks. Findings include soft-tissue abnormalities such as swelling
and hematomas and musculoskeletal injuries such as fractures. These ﬁndings reﬂect prior
research on IPV injury patterns.10

5.2. Error analysis

We ﬁnd diﬀerences in performance in subgroups of age, gender, race in our error analysis
(see Table 4). We focus on sensitivity because in cases of IPV and injury, it is much more
important to detect all true positives. In particular, older patients (51-65, 66+) have lower
sensitivity for both IPV and injury prediction. Other groups have low sensitivity for either

patients who are not single or married (e.g. widowed, separated) have lower sensitivity for
injury whereas married patients have lower sensitivity for IPV prediction.

5.3. Report-program date gap

We can detect IPV from radiology reports much earlier than a patient’s entry into a violence
prevention program. We compute the report-program date gap with speciﬁcity threshold of
the random forest classiﬁer set to 95% and ﬁnd a median date gap of 3.08 years, compared to
the median earliest possible date gap of 5.83 years. For visual representations of the predicted
date gap compared to the earliest possible date gap and the prediction scores, see Figure 1.

6. Discussion and conclusion

We present a range of ﬁndings on the use of prediction algorithms to address IPV in the
clinical setting through the analysis of radiology reports. Our results demonstrate several main
takeaways. First, with a dataset of 34,642 reports and 1,479 patients, we are able accurately
predict IPV and injury with AUCs of 0.852 and 0.887, respectively. Second, while our algorithm
demonstrates some bias in the form of diﬀerences in accuracy, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity with
respect to age, gender, race, and marital status, we are able to predict a median report-program
date gap of over 3.08 years with sensitivity of 64% and speciﬁcity of 95%.

Our work leads naturally to many directions for future research. One limitation of our
current work is that we consider one radiology report at a time for IPV and injury prediction
and exclude clinical history. Because IPV victims seek greater medical care from clinical set-
tings like the emergency department,7,8 patient data including previous visits, clinical notes,
and diagnoses could yield more accurate predictions and therefore earlier detection.19 Ad-
ditionally, predictive algorithms can help identify the best intervention for an IPV victim.
Currently screening programs for IPV vary in execution and eﬀect,50 and once screened, IPV
victims face many obstacles before leaving an abusive relationship.51 Deeper understanding of
targeted interventions could provide a crucial contribution to patient advocacy.

Deployment of a predictive model for IPV and injury detection faces several practical
challenges. As with many machine learning algorithms in clinical settings, question of general-
ization across hospitals22 and across subgroups47 raise concerns about robustness and fairness.

Moreover, better understanding of physician reliance on, distrust of, and confusion towards
predictive models in clinical settings is an active area of research.52 We have shown in our
analysis that automated detection through machine learning can predict IPV and injury from
radiology reports. We look forward to future work towards the deployment of an IPV early
detection model in a clinical setting.
