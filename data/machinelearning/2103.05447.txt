Abstract: One of the most important subjects of hydraulic engineering is the reliable estimation of 
the  transverse  distribution  in  the  rectangular  channel  of  bed  and  wall  shear  stresses.  This  study 
makes use of the Tsallis entropy,  genetic programming (GP) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference 
system (ANFIS) methods to assess the shear stress distribution (SSD) in the rectangular channel. To 
evaluate  the  results  of  the  Tsallis  entropy,  GP  and  ANFIS  models,  laboratory  observations  were 
used  in  which  shear  stress was  measured  using  an  optimized  Preston tube.  This is  then  used  to 
measure the SSD in various aspect ratios in the rectangular channel. To investigate the shear stress 
percentage, 10 data series with a total of 112 different data for were used. The results of the sensi-
tivity analysis show that the most influential parameter for the SSD in smooth rectangular channel 
is the dimensionless parameter B/H, Where the transverse coordinate is B, and the flow depth is H. 
With the parameters (b/B), (B/H) for the bed and (z/H), (B/H) for the wall as inputs, the modeling of 
the GP was better than the other one. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the use of GP 
and ANFIS algorithms is more effective in estimating shear stress in smooth rectangular channels 
than the Tsallis entropy-based equations.

1. Introduction 

Knowledge of boundary shear stress is necessary when studying sediment transport, 
flow pattern around structures, estimation of scour depth and channel migration. The de-
termination  of  boundary  shear  stress,  i.e.,  at  the  wall  and  bed  depends  on  the  channel 
geometry and its associated roughness. Various direct and indirect methods have been 
extensively discussed in experimentally measure the wall and bed shear stresses in chan-
nels with different cross sections [1–4]. Bed shear stress can be estimated based on four 
=
techniques  (1)  bed  slope  product  𝜏𝑏 = g𝐻𝑆  ,  (2)  law  of  the  wall  velocity  profiles

lent kinetic energy (TKE),  TKE =
are the fluctuating horizontal, transversal and vertical velocity components, respectively 
and  𝐶1 = 0.20  [5]. The symbols g, H and S denote gravity, water level and channel slope, 
respectively, whereas  𝑢  is the velocity at height z,  𝑢∗  is the shear velocity, k is von Kar-
man constant and  𝑧0  is the roughness length.

These methods are useful in presenting a point-based representation of shear stress 
in a channel, whereas the shear stress distribution (SSD) provides a more accurate hydro-
dynamic profile within a channel. Knight and Sterling [6] measured the SSD in a circular 
channel with and without sediment. They examined a wide range of flow depths for each 
level benching and  therefore it had been possible to  determine  the  extent to  which  the 
hydraulics changes Park et al. [7] utilized laboratory-scale water flume and measured the 

 
 
 
bed shear stress under high-velocity flow conditions directly. Lashkar-Ara and Fatahi [8] 
measured transverse SSD in the channel bed and wall by using an optimal diameter Pres-
ton tube to evaluate the SSD on a rectangular open channel. The outcome of this research 
is two-dimensional relationships to evaluate local shear stress in both bed and wall. The 
bed and wall relative coordinates b/B and z/H in the cross section also the aspect ratio B/H 
are the function of these relationships. The study showed that the dimensionless SSD is 
greatly affected by the aspect ratio. Utilizing the advantages offered in the soft computing 
method  and  the  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  techniques,  other  researchers  have  been  ex-
tended numerically and analytically to overcome difficulties with experimental measure-
ments [9–12]. Martinez-Vazquez and Sharifi [13] utilized recurrence plot (RP) analysis and 
eigenface for recognition to estimate the SSD in trapezoidal and circular channels. A new 
approach has been developed by Sterling and Knight [14] to estimate the SSD in a circular 
open channel. In terms of accuracy, the analysis showed that there is a lack of ability in 
the outcome and it is not satisfactory. The uncertainty of the estimation of the model pa-
rameters and the high sensitivity of the outcomes to the expected experiment parameters 
can be due to this. Sheikh Khozani and Bonakdari  [15] extended the  analytical method 
based Renyi entropy to estimate SSD in circular channels. Sheikh Khozani and Bonakdari 
[16] researched on the comparison of five different models in straight compound channel 
prediction of SSD. In other research, Sheikh Khozani and Wan Mohtar [10] analyzed the 
formulation of the SSD on the basis of the Tsallis entropy in circular and trapezoidal chan-
nels. Sheikh Khozani et al. [17] have attempted in another study to use an improved SVM 
method to estimate shear stress in rough rectangular channel. 

Ardiҫlioğlu et al. [18], conducted an experimental study for the SSD throughout the 
entire length of the cross-section in fully developed boundary layer area, in an open rec-
tangular  channel,  in  both  smooth  and  rough  surface.  By  measuring  the  speed  in  both 
smooth and rough surfaces, they conducted tests. Using logarithmic distribution of veloc-
ity,  the  average  shear  stresses  in  the  cross  section  for  aspect  ratios  of  4.2–21.6  and  the 
Froude numbers of 0.12–1.23 were measured. The definition of  the  Tsallis entropy  was 
used by Bonakdari et al. [19] to predict the SSD in trapezoidal and circular channels and 
achieve acceptable accuracy. Although the direct measurement of shear stress in labora-
tory provides correct description of the spatial pattern, the measurement of shear stress 
using shear place or cell is laborious, complex, requires careful calibration and may not 
applicable to all type of channels [20]. The use of soft computing techniques in the simu-
lation of engineering problems was intensively studied and a variety of soft computing 
methods were suggested. To approximate the daily suspended sediment load, Kisi et al. 
[21] used a  genetic programming (GP) model. They  also contrasted this approach with 
various machine learning methods and concluded that the GP model works better than 
the  others.  In  estimating  SSD  in  circular  channels  with  and  without  flat-bed  Sheikh 
Khozani et al. [22,23] applied randomize neural network (RNN) and gene expression pro-
gramming (GEP). In this study, the Tsallis entropy was used to determine SSD in a smooth 
bed and wall in a rectangular open channel. This is then used to measure the SSD in vari-
ous aspect ratios in the rectangular channel. In the second part of the study, two soft com-
puting methods were applied to predict the transverse of SSD in the smooth rectangular 
channel. The methods of genetic programming (GP) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy infer-
ence system (ANFIS) were examined to determine the precision of these models in esti-
mating bed and wall shear stress. This study aimed at using the Tsallis entropy method 
to predict the SSD in the smooth rectangular channel. The results of the Tsallis entropy, 
GP and ANFIS methods compared with experimental results of Lashkar-Ara and Fatahi 
[8]. Although this analysis was performed in parallel with Sheikh Khozani and Bonakdari 
[16] research, it can be said in a practical contrast that the data used in this study is based 
on the measurement of shear stress using the optimal diameter of the Preston tube, which 
was designed by Lashkar-Ara and Fatahi [8], so the comparison of findings is more precise 
and less uncertain. 

 
 
 
2. Materials and Methods 

2.1. Data Collection 

Information on the SSD was collected in the Lashkar-Ara and Fatahi [8] experiments 
of a smooth rectangular channel, performed in a flume 10-meter long, 60 cm wide and 70 
cm high. All measurements were performed in the range of 11.06–102.38 liter per second 
flow rate. Flow rate variations led to observable changes in water depth ranging from 4.3 
to 21 cm and the aspect ratio of 2.86–13.95. The values of static and total pressure differ-
ence in various aspect ratios of  B/H were measured and reported using pressure trans-
ducer apparatus with a capacity of 200 mill bar and 50 Hz measuring frequency. In order 
to create uniform flow condition and to match the hydraulic gradient with the flume bed 
slope a weir at the end of the flume was installed. Figure 1 illustrates the notation used 
for a smooth rectangular channel conduit. Figure 2 shows the schematic of experimental 
setup.

Based on previous studies in the laboratory and field investigation, the effective cri-
teria  for  evaluating  the  SSD  along  the  wet  periphery  of  a  channel  can  be  expressed  as 
follows: 

where  𝜏̄𝑤  is  the  average  wall  shear  stress,  𝜏̄𝑏  is  the  average  bed  shear  stress,  𝜌  is  the 
density, υ is the kinematic viscosity, g is the gravity acceleration, V is the flow velocity, H

is the flow depth, B is the flume bed width, Sw is the water surface slope,  𝑘𝑠  is the rough-
ness height, (Re) is the Reynolds number and (Fr) is the Froude number.   

The Buckingham-π theorem is used to obtain independent dimensional parameters 

for wall and bed shear stress, as shown in Equations (3) and (4).

In the case of smooth channel equations (3) and (4) can be rewritten as (5) and (6):

For GP simulation, 160 data of bed shear stress (τb) and 100 data of wall shear stress 
(τw) were collected in a smooth rectangular channel with different flow depths. Approxi-
mately 70 percent of the total data were chosen for training and the remaining 30 percent 
for testing. The summary of experiments is tabulated in Table 1.

If a random variable (τ) in a cross section of a channel is assumed to be a consistent 
shear stress, then, according to Tsallis entropy of  [24] the SSD or shear stress probability 
density function f(τ), can be identified as [19]: 

where τ is the shear stress, q is a true number, and Tsallis 's entropy function is H(τ). The 
τ value varies from 0 to τmax, and with these restrictions, the integral value of H(τ) will be 
1.   

Using the maximum entropy theorem, the f(τ) can be calculated to maximize the en-
tropy function subject to specified constraints like Equations (8) and (9) respectively [25].

At this stage, using maximization of Lagrange coefficients by Equations (7)–(9), the 

Lagrange function L can be written down as Equation (10): 

where λ0 and λ1 are the Lagrange multipliers. By ∂L/∂(τ)  = 0 to maximize entropy, the f(τ) 
yields as:

where  𝜆′ =

tion (PDF) is represented by f(τ). The SSD's cumulative distribution function (CDF) is in-
troduced as Equation (12):

(12) 

where y is the direction of the channel wall, which varies from 0 at the free surface to L, 
and  L  is  the  entire  wetted  perimeter.  The  function  of  f(τ)  is  the  derivative  of  F(τ),  so  a 
partial derivation of F(τ) with respect to y is carried out in the following equation: 

𝑓(𝜏) =

(13) 

By substituting Equation (11) into Equations (12) and (13) and solving the integral 

and simplifying, the shear stress function is represented as Equation (14).

where k = q/q − 1 and q value is the constant of ¾ according to [10,26], which is defined as 
the parameter of the Tsallis relationship. λ1 and λ′ are Lagrange multipliers that can be 
derived by trial and error from two implicit equations that follow. Indeed, by inserting 
and integrating Equation (10) into two constraints (Equations (8) and (9)), two Equations 
(15) and (16) are returned as:

(16) 

Equations (15) and (16) solve to obtain two undefined Lagrange multipliers (λ1 and 
λ′).  To  estimate  the  SSD,  a  pair  of  mean  and  maximum  shear  stresses  is  required.  The 
results of the Lashkar-Ara and Fatahi [9] studies have been used for this reason in order 
to  estimate  the  values  of  τmax  and  𝜏̄ .  They  adjusted  the  slope  of  the  bed  flume  at 
9.58 × 10−4. The shear stress carried by the walls and bed was measured for  a different 
aspect ratio (B/H = 2.86, 4.51, 5.31, 6.19, 7.14, 7.89, 8.96, 10.71, 12.24 and 13.95). For each 
aspect ratio, the distribution of shear stress in the bed and wall was measured by a Preston 
tube. The best fit equation was obtained for τmax and  𝜏̄ separately for wall and bed in as-
pect ratio 2.89 < B/H < 13.95 by assuming a fully turbulent and subcritical regime among 
all the experimental results. Relationships are shown in Equations (17)–(20).

where  𝜏̄𝑤&𝜏̄𝑏  and  𝜏max 𝑤 and 𝜏max 𝑏are the mean and maximum shear stress on the chan-

channel can be determined depending  on the  aspect ratio and the  slope of the  channel 
bed. 

2.3. Genetic Programming (GP) 

In the second part of this analysis, the GP model is applied as one of the evolutionary 
algorithms (EA) to improve the accuracy of the given relations. The GP is an automated 
programming method to solve problems by designing computer programs GP is widely 
used for  modeling structure recognition technology applications concerns. For this aim 
the GP technique was used to understand the basic structure of a natural or experimental 
process. The GP can optimize both the structure of the model and its parameters. One of 
the advantages of the GP algorithm is that it can extract an equation based the input and 
output parameters and it is more effective than other ANN models [27]. Table 2 represents 
the used parameters in modeling with GP algorithm including function set, the terminal 
. Further values of the  parameters, i.e., number  of

inputs, the fitness function, error type, crossover rate, mutation rate, gene reproduction 
rate, population size, number of generations, tournament type, tournament size, max tree 
depth, max node per tree, and constants range can be found from [28]. The outcomes of 
the GP model were analyzed by using the statistical indexes and compared with the ex-
perimental results.

2.4. Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) 

ANFIS is designed to provide the requisite inputs and outputs for adaptive networks 
to build fuzzy rules with acceptable membership functions. ANFIS is a common and car-
dinal programming method that uses fuzzy theory to write fuzzy if-then rules and fuzzy 
logic bases that map from a given input information to the desired output. An adaptive 
network is a multilayer feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) with; partially or 
entirely adaptive nodes in which the outputs are predicted on adaptive node parameters 

bbww 
 
 
and the parameter adjustment is specified by the learning rules due to the error term. In 
adaptive ANFIS, hybrid learning is generally a learning form [29]. 

2.5. Criteria for Statistical Assessment 

Maximum error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) 
and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) are the four statistical evaluation parameters used to 
determine the Tsallis entropy, GP model and ANFIS model performance, which are meas-
ured as follows [30,31].

3. Results 

3.1. Modeling of GP 

In this section, sensitivity of the GP model for any input parameter is evaluated by 
adding all four inputs to the models first. Each parameter is then omitted and a total of 
three separate versions are checked. The GP models used for data on the bed and wall are 
described as:

GP Model(3): 

For  each  channel  section,  three  different  models  were  evaluated  to  investigate  the 
effect of each input parameter in the GP modeling. The findings of the modeling of bed 
shear stress show that the GP model (1) had the lowest error consisting of input parame-
ters (b/B, B/H, Fr and Re). The results of the modeling of bed shear stress revealed that the 
lowest error (average RMSE = 0.0874) was observed in the GP model (1) consisting of input 
parameters (b/B, B/H, Fr and Re) and modeled wall shear stress, the GP model (1) had the 
lowest input error (z/H, B/H, Fr and Re) (average RMSE = 0.0692), so that the B/H had a 
major influence on the GP model and validated the effects of model (1). By performing a 

 
 
 
 
 
 
sensitivity analysis, since the flow situation  was fully developed, the Reynolds number 
could be ignored and the parameter was eliminated in model (2).   

As shown in Table 3, by omitting the Reynolds number (Re) in the input parameters, 
there was no significant difference. On the other hand, because all the experiments exam-
ined the subcritical flow conditions, the effect Froude number could be ignored and the 
parameter was eliminated in model 3. By eliminating the Reynolds number and Froude 
number parameters, the GP model performance did not change much, and the GP model 
could  be  deduced  to  be  insensitive  to  the  B/H  parameter.  The  B/H  ratio  was  obviously 
important in the estimation of shear stress, as this parameter played a significant role in 
the equations stated. Therefore, the model 3 for the bed and wall was chosen as the most 
suitable model. The results of the most accurate GP model and experimental bed and wall 
data are shown in the form of the scatter plots in Figures 3 and 4. As seen in statistical 
analysis, the GP model outcomes were very similar to the bed and wall shear stress line 
fitted. Dimensionless bed shear stress modeling with GP was superior to dimensionless 
wall shear stress modeling with average NSE of 0.945 and 0.8266, respectively, and both 
models were superior to the other GP models in this study. In order to decide the best 
answer, the best feedback should be treated as a pattern. Different important parameters 
in  modeling,  such  as  population  members,  number  of  generations,  tree  structures  size, 
etc., should be carefully determined in the first step with regard to the consumer of the 
data examined.   

The scale of each configuration of the tree will play a major role in the final model's 
accuracy. Determining the numbers greater than the optimal value reduced the precision 
of the test results and it prevented displaying the models, which are not presented largely 
because the models generated by genetic programming were of a very long-scale in order 
to measure the shear stress. The method of fitting models resulting from genetic program-
ming against experimental results of parameters 2.86, 4.51, 7.14 and 13.95 are shown in 
Figure 4. The statistical analysis results of GP model predictions tabulated in Table 3.

3.2. ANFIS Modeling 

For this purpose, 70% of the experimental data  was used for network training and 
the  remaining 30%  was used for  testing results. As  input parameters  to the  model, the 
parameters b/B and B/H for bed and z/H and B/H for the wall were presented. Figure 5 
shows  the  performance  of  the  ANFIS  model  to  estimate  the  bed  SSD (τb)  and  Figure  6 
shows the performance of the ANFIS model to estimate the wall SSD (τw), 30% of the data, 
which were not used in the training stage would be used to evaluate the performance of 
the model. The results of statistical indexes for modeling shear stress with ANFIS are sum-
marized in Table 4. As well, the estimating bands of the four above parameters using to 
determine the shear stress are shown in Figure 5. Skewness results obtained from statisti-
cal prediction dimensionless parameters.

3.3. Comparison of the GP Model, Tsallis Entropy and ANFIS 

The results of the best GP models and Tsallis entropy in shear stress prediction were 
compared with the experimental results of Lashkar-Ara and Fatahi [8] in this section. Fig-
ures 7 and 8 show the experimental results and SSD predictions with different models in 
a smooth rectangular channel for B/H equal to 2.85, 4.51, 7.14 and 13.95. Additionally, the 
performance metric of the shear stress estimate by the Tsallis entropy model is shown in 
Table 5. As shown in these statistics, all of the test evidence used to model the SSD using 
the GP was is realized. For the training stage for modeling SSD in the rectangular channel 
using the GP model, 70 percent of all data were used, and 30 percent of the data were used 
for the testing process. As shown in Figure 7, for B/H= 2.86, 4.51, 7.14 and 13.95, the GP 
model predicted the bed shear stress better than the Tsallis entropy model. In Figure 8c,d, 
for B/H = 7.14 and 13.95, the GP model predicted wall shear stress better than the Tsallis 
entropy model, but in Figure  8a,b, the Tsallis entropy was more accurately modeled to 
predict wall shear stress than the GP model. Additionally, the GP model estimated bed 
and wall shear stress better than the Tsallis entropy-based model at rising flow depth. It 
is understandable that the channel architecture was challenging when a model expected 
higher  shear  stress  values.  It  is  therefore  not  cost-effective  to  use  the  Tsallis  entropy 
method. When the GP model's observations were more accurate, it could be used to de-
sign stable channels more consistently. The GP model estimated the bed shear better than 
the  ANFIS  model  for  B/H=  2.86, 4.51,  7.14  and  13.95. For  B/H  =  2.86,  the  ANFIS model 
estimated the shear stress better than the GP model, but the GP model estimated the wall 
shear  stress  better  than  the  ANFIS  model  in  B/H  =  4.51,  7.14  and  13.95.  The  GP  model 
demonstrated superior efficiency to the Tsallis entropy-based model, while both models 
neglected the influence of secondary flows. It can be inferred that the GP model of bed 
and wall shear stress estimation was more sensitive than the Tsallis entropy method over-
estimated the values of bed shear stress and the GP model's outcomes were greater. The 
bed shear stress values decreased at the middle of the channel (Figure 7), which varied 
from other situations. From Figures 7 and 8, it can be shown that the GP model's fit line 
was similar to the 45-degree line than the other ones, and with a higher value of NSE, its 
predictions were more reliable. In predicting the position of maximal shear stress, both 
the GP and Tsallis-entropy based models displayed the same pattern as the centerline of 
the channel, which was consistent with the experimental outputs.

4. Conclusions 

The wall and bed shear stresses in a smooth rectangular channel measured experi-
mentally for different aspect ratios. Two soft computing models GP and ANFIS proposed 
to estimate SSD in rectangular channel. In addition, the results of GP and ANFIS model 
compared with a Tsallis based equation. Our research had some main findings as follows: 
1.  The effect of different input variable on the result was investigated to find the best 

input combination. 
In the present study B/H had the highest effect on the prediction power. 

2. 
3.  For bed shear stress predictions, the GP model, with an average RMSE of 0.0893 per-
formed better than the Tsallis entropy-based equation and ANFIS model with RMSE 
of 0.0714 and 0.138 respectively. 

 
 
 
4.  To estimate  the  wall shear  stress distribution the proposed ANFIS model, with an 
average  RMSE of 0.0846  outperformed the  Tsallis entropy-based equation  with  an 
RMSE of 0.0880 followed by the GP model with an RMSE of 0.0904. 

Our finding suggests that the proposed GP algorithm could be used as a reliable and 

cost-effective algorithm to enhance SSD prediction in rectangular channels.
