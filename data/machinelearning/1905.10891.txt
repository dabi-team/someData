Introduction

One trend in the recent healthcare transformations is
people are encouraged to monitor and manage their
health based on their daily diets and physical activ-
ity habits. However, much attention of the use of
operational research and analytical models in health-
care has been paid to the systematic level such as
country or regional policy making or organisational
issues. This paper proposes a model concerned with
healthcare analytics at the individual level, which can
predict human physical activity status from sequen-
tial lifelogging data collected from wearable sensors.
The model has a two-stage hybrid structure (in short,
MOGP-HMM) – a multi-objective genetic program-
ming (MOGP) algorithm in the ﬁrst stage to reduce the
dimensions of lifelogging data and a hidden Markov
model (HMM) in the second stage for activity status
prediction over time.
It can be used as a decision
support tool to provide real-time monitoring, statisti-
cal analysis and personalized advice to individuals, en-
couraging positive attitudes towards healthy lifestyles.
We validate the model with the real data collected from
a group of participants in the UK, and compare it with
other popular two-stage hybrid models. Our experi-
mental results show that the MOGP-HMM can achieve
comparable performance. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the very ﬁrst study that uses the MOGP
in the hybrid two-stage structure for individuals’ activ-
ity status prediction. It ﬁts seamlessly with the current
trend in the UK healthcare transformation of patient
empowerment as well as contributing to a strategic de-
velopment for more efﬁcient and cost-effective provi-
sion of healthcare.

With the signiﬁcant development of technologies and the rad-
ical changes of socio-economic environment, the management
planning and decision-making faced by businesses have become
more and more complex, requiring the use of sophisticated ana-
lytical tools. Operational research techniques (e.g., optimisation,
forecasting, simulation) together with other quantitative disci-
plines (e.g., probability theory, statistics, machine learning, data
mining) are particularly useful to solve these challenges (Grnig
& Khn, 2013; Chen et al., 2018; Hindle & Vidgen, 2018). There-
fore, even though the contributions of the above techniques and
models themselves are well-documented, the term business an-
alytics has been established over the past decade (Doumpos
& Zopounidis, 2016). Business analytics, or simply analytics,
uses data, information technology, statistical analysis, mathemat-
ical models, optimisation techniques and computer-based simu-
lations to gain improved insight about business operations and
make better, fact-based decisions (Evans, 2017). In other words,
business analytics is a new multidisciplinary subject which com-
bines the ﬁelds of operational research, machine learning, data
mining, statistics, big data, and so on (Mortenson et al., 2015).
It highlights the growing need to use of quantitative approaches
for management planning and decision making in a broader con-
text encompassing data, processes, and systems through the inte-
gration of traditional problem structuring and solving paradigms
with data management and reporting tools, in a way that fa-
cilitates learning and action planning in an operational frame-
work (Doumpos & Zopounidis, 2016).

Healthcare is one of the world’s largest industries, with many
people involved either as employees in healthcare systems or as
consumers of healthcare services. Four decades ago, scholars
started to use operational research techniques to design health-
care systems and to improve healthcare service delivery (Fries,
1976; Krischer, 1980). The European Working Group on Oper-
ational Research Applied to Health Services (ORAHS) has been
organising annual meetings since 1975. Many of the operational
research studies in healthcare have been focused on the appli-
cation of systematic analysis (Brailsford & Vissers, 2011) such
as national or regional policy making and organisational issues.
Over the years, technology has revolutionised the way we live,
learn and work. It has also been one of the forces driving health-
care transformation. One trend is that people are encouraged to
monitor and manage their health based on their daily eating and

 
 
 
 
 
 
their physical activity habits based on people-centred healthcare
and patient empowerment (World Health Organization, 2014b).
For example, Rudner et al. (2016) reported a case in which a doc-
tor suggested that a patient who had a history of seizures should
wear a Fitbit.1 This device is a wearable sensor that can track
the patient’s pulse rate and record it through a mobile phone ap-
plication. The doctor then used the lifelogging data collected
from the Fitbit to successfully determine an irregular heart beat
that coincided with a grand mal seizure that had occurred three
hours earlier. This is a successful application of business analyt-
ics in healthcare (sometimes called healthcare analytics) at the
individual level.

In this paper, we propose a new model concerned with individ-
ual healthcare analytics. Our model can predict human physical
activity status from sequential lifelogging data collected from
portable devices such as mobile phones and wearable sensors.
Physical activity refers to any bodily movement produced by
skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure, including ac-
tivities undertaken while working, playing, travelling, carrying
out household tasks and engaging in recreational pursuits (World
Health Organization, 2017). According to World Health Orga-
nization (2014a), “Insufﬁcient physical activity is one of the 10
leading risk factors for global mortality, causing some 3.2 million
deaths each year. In 2010, insufﬁcient physical activity caused
69.3 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) – 2.8% of the
total – globally”. As regular physical activity for adults can re-
duce the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and all-
cause mortality, the World Health Organization has set a global
target to reduce by 10% the prevalence of insufﬁcient physi-
cal activity by 2025. Reaching this target requires multisectoral
collaboration among government departments and organisations.
On an individual level, early disease detection and timely treat-
ment are an effective and economic approach. The use of wear-
able sensors such as mobile phones, smart watches and ﬁtness
trackers to recognise and monitor human activities has recently
been investigated for individual health self-management, and it
has become an emerging topic in healthcare analytics.

Many conventional studies employ descriptive statistics to sum-
marise lifelogging data and to determine certain thresholds as
minimum requirements in terms of daily or weekly walking
steps or other metrics to estimate human physical activity sta-
tus (Caspersen et al., 1985; Pate et al., 1995; Choi et al., 2007).
However, there are two major limitations of those studies. First,
human physical activity status in many conventional studies is
usually classiﬁed into two states, active or inactive, which has
limited insights and prevents broader applications. Fine-grained
classiﬁcation can be further investigated to measure physical ac-
tivity status. The second limitation is that many conventional
studies only illustrate the static characteristics of data without
considering historical information. This limitation is particularly
evident in the case of individual health self-management. The
pattern of physical activity from one person to the next is dif-
ferent. Therefore, when high dimensional sequential lifelogging
data is collected from wearable sensors, it is worth considering
individuals’ sequential activities and the effects of previous activ-
ities on the current activity status (Zhou & Gurrin, 2012; Gurrin
et al., 2014).

Our proposed model has a two-stage hybrid structure (in short,
MOGP-HMM). It contains a multi-objective genetic program-
ming (MOGP) algorithm in the ﬁrst stage and a hidden Markov
model (HMM) in the second stage. The MOGP alleviates the
ﬁrst limitation mentioned above.
It is a multi-class classiﬁer
that transforms a high-dimensional feature space of the collected
lifelogging data into a new discrete class space which represents
activity observation. The HMM in the second stage addresses
the second limitation. It is a chain-structured Bayesian network
which can be used to exploit the sequential patterns from obser-
vations. Simply put, an individual’s physical activity status at
a time is described by a latent variable. Latent variables over
time are connected through a Markov process rather than be-
ing independent of each other. Since scoring systems have been
widely used in assessing quality of life (QoL) such as QoL ques-
tionnaire VF-14 (Terwee et al., 1998) and SF-12 (Gandek et al.,
1998), observation and physical activity status in our study are
both expressed in terms of a measurement score ranging from
the inactive state to the highly active state. Given a time series of
observations, the HMM can predict an individual’s activity sta-
tus accordingly. We validate the model with the real lifelogging
data collected from a group of participants in the UK, and con-
duct experiments in a supervised learning setting (Bishop, 2007)
where the scores (or states) of activity status are labelled based
on the UK national health guidelines (UK National Health Ser-
vice, 2015). We also compare our model with another popular
hybrid model SVM-HMM which combines a support vector ma-
chine (SVM) with a HMM. Our experimental results show that
the MOGP-HMM can achieve comparable performance as the
SVM-HMM. However, Unlike SVMs, our MOGP-HMM model
is not sensitive to the choice of kernel functions and thus provides
more robust and discriminative representations of sparse data.

The research of this paper is multidisciplinary, which contributes
to the recent use of operational research, machine learning, data
mining, big data and the Internet of things in healthcare analyt-
ics. Firstly, this is one of the few studies which discuss the im-
plementation of operational research in healthcare at the individ-
ual level (Royston, 1998). In the meantime, lifelogging data is
truly a big data problem because it is multidimensional, it con-
tains many different features in terms of different formats, and
it can be retrieved continuously from wearable sensors. We de-
velop a two-stage model to reduce the complexity of lifelogging
data and then to predict an individual’s physical activity status
over time. In essence, the proposed model is a personalized data-
driven model based on the state-of-the-art machine learning algo-
rithms so it contributes to the applications of machine learning.
Further, our model can be deployed on a cloud server and can
be used as a decision support tool to provide real-time monitor-
ing, statistical analysis and personalized advice to an individual
through portable digital devices. Therefore, it can be a practi-
cal application of the Internet of things in healthcare. Within the
ﬁeld of business analytics, our proposed model contains tech-
nology, quantitative methods and decision making. As indicated
by Mortenson et al. (2015), they are the key elements of business
analytics. Similar to the existing studies (Harris et al., 2016; Dag
et al., 2016, 2017; Topuz et al., 2018; Roumani et al., 2018), our
proposed model deals with predictive analytics. From a high-
level perspective in healthcare, this study ﬁts seamlessly with the
current trend in the UK healthcare for patient empowerment, and

contributes to a strategic development for the provision of more
efﬁcient and cost-effective healthcare.

Technology wise, using the MOGP also provides methodologi-
cal contributions in the two-stage hybrid modelling for physical
activity prediction.
It is a non-parametric optimisation classi-
ﬁer, differing from many genetic algorithms and machine learn-
ing models where parameters need to be set or trained in advance.
It uses Pareto dominance to optimally select GP tree models con-
sidering the trade-off between the model ﬁtness and complexity.
Therefore, the MOGP is more efﬁcient and robust. Unlike the
SVM, it is not sensitive to the choice of kernel functions and thus
provides more robust and discriminative representation of sparse
data. As lifelogging data is usually sparse and noisy due to the
fact that each individual usually has his or her own activity pat-
tern, the MOGP algorithm seems more suitable than the SVM
in activity learning. Although GP algorithms have been used
to evolve probabilistic trees that search for the optimal topol-
ogy in bioinformatics (Won et al., 2007) and stock trading (Chen
et al., 2009; Ghaddar et al., 2016), to the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst work that a MOGP algorithm has been used as
a multi-class classiﬁer to construct a classiﬁcation-HMM hybrid
model for solving sequential learning problems. Our model can
be of interest and easily adapted to other relevant domains in
business analytics, such as consumer choice modelling (Sandkci
et al., 2008; Blanchet et al., 2016) and high dimensional business
data classiﬁcation or dimension reduction (Debaere et al., 2018;
Ghaddar & Naoum-Sawaya, 2018).

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2
reviews the related literature. Section 3 introduces our proposed
hybrid model. Section 4 describes our data, presents experimen-
tal results and gives an analysis. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 Related work

Our study touches upon several streams of literature. In the fol-
lowing discussion, we review the related work in both healthcare
and hybrid learning machines. For the former, we ﬁrst discuss the
recent studies on the use of operational research in healthcare at
the country and organisational levels, and then individual health
monitoring, prediction and self-management using wearable sen-
sors. For the latter, we discuss the basic concepts and settings of
hybrid learning machines and compare the related two-stage hy-
brid models.

Operational research has been used and developed for health-
care over the years in the hope of improving the healthcare ef-
fectiveness and efﬁciency as well as controlling or reducing the
costs (Fries, 1976; Krischer, 1980; Brailsford & Vissers, 2011).
A signiﬁcant proportion of earlier studies has examined health-
care systems at the country or organisational level (Brailsford
& Vissers, 2008; Kunc et al., 2018), such as national healthcare
policy making or management, organisational issues and service
delivery. For example, at the national level, Hindle et al. (2013)
proposed a decision support framework based on geographical
modelling for the strategic management of radical changes in
hospital services in Northern Ireland. Denoyel et al. (2017) de-
signed a structured optimisation model for bill payers combining
reference pricing and tiered network for novel healthcare pay-

ment policies in the United States. Willis et al. (2018) proposed a
multi-methodology approach for healthcare workforce planning
in England. Hejazi et al. (2018) discussed a reliability-based
approach to measure healthcare system performance for policy
makers. At the organisational level, Tako & Kotiadis (2015) pro-
posed a framework to support facilitated simulation modelling
in healthcare. Li et al. (2017) designed utilization-based spatial
accessibility decision support systems for patients. Kunc et al.
(2018) further investigated the importance of human behaviour
aspects in the application of operational research in healthcare at
an organisational level by reviewing 130 related papers. Rouyen-
degh et al. (2018) proposed a data envelopment analysis based
fuzzy multi-criteria decision making model to enhance the busi-
ness performance of companies in the healthcare industry.

Royston (1998) pointed out that prevention and treatment based
on each patient’s knowledge and habit are part of the key shift
patterns of using the operational research in healthcare for the
21st century. Our study in this paper is concerned with health-
care analytics at the individual level. Speciﬁcally, we are focused
on individual health monitoring, prediction and self-management
using wearable sensors. It should be noted that wearable sensors
here refer to mobile phones, smart watches, ﬁtness trackers, and
ad-hoc wearable devices like Shimmer.2 There are two groups
of related literature. The ﬁrst group analyses the vital signs pro-
vided by wearable sensors (Banaee et al., 2013) such as electro-
cardiogram, oxygen saturation, heart rate, photoplethysmogra-
phy, blood glucose, blood pressure and respiratory rate. The sec-
ond group is focused on recognising and monitoring individual
human activities (Liao et al., 2005; Luque et al., 2014; Vilarinho
et al., 2015; Micucci et al., 2017; Kulev et al., 2016), which also
overlaps with the ﬁelds of computer vision, machine learning and
data mining. Our study in this paper is closer to the second group.
We use wearable sensors to collect lifelogging data from a group
of participants in the UK. Further details about our data are dis-
cussed in Section 4. It is worth mentioning the following two
studies in the second group. Liao et al. (2005) discussed a general
framework for activity recognition by building upon and extend-
ing relational Markov networks. The model includes a variety
of features including temporal information, spatial information
and global constraints, so human activity locations (e.g., home,
work, shop, dinning, etc.) can then be predicted. Kulev et al.
(2016) proposed a mixture model to understand how the inter-
vention affects daily human activities, whether they increase or
decrease the amount of physical activities at each moment during
the day. Two types of information are relevant: the person’s daily
activity pattern before the intervention and their activity change
pattern after the intervention. The model is used to ﬁnd the latent
structure in a heterogeneous population.

Hybrid models have been widely used in machine learning to
solve different real world problems. In some reference, they are
called hybrid learning machines (Abraham et al., 2009) or intel-
ligent hybrid systems (Goonatilake & Khebbal, 1995). As hybrid
learning machines use different types of models, here we explain
some important concepts and theories. According to Domingos
(2015), there are ﬁve major tribes in machine learning or arti-
ﬁcial intelligence in general: symbolists, connectiontists, evo-
lutionaires, Bayesians and analogizers. Symbolists believe all

intelligence can be reduced to manipulating symbols and they
solve problems using pre-existing knowledge. Many expert sys-
tems use the symbolists’ approaches to solve problems with a set
of rules (Zhang & Zhang, 2014) and fuzzy logic is the attempt of
symbolists at tackling uncertainties (Zadeh, 1965). Connection-
tists hope to use artiﬁcial neural networks to represent manm-
malian neural systems such as deep neural networks (Goodfellow
et al., 2016). Evolutionaires are inﬂuenced by Darwin’s theory on
evolution and believe that all learning arises from natural selec-
tion such as genetic programming (Koza, 1992). Bayesians are
concerned above all with uncertainty and their theories are heav-
ily based on probabilistic inference and Bayes’ theorem such as
the HMM (Bishop, 2007). Analogizers are the least cohesive
of the ﬁve tribes (Domingos, 2015), recognising similarities be-
tween situations and thereby inferring other similarities such as
the SVM (Vapnik, 2000). A hybrid learning machine can contain
at least two machine learning models from one tribe or differ-
ent tribes. It could be called the hybrid neural system (Wermter
& Sun, 2000) if all models come from the connectionists’ tribe
such as the work of Borrajo et al. (2011). The models in a hy-
brid learning machine can be used in parallel or by sequence. For
example, Peddabachigari et al. (2007) discussed a hybrid learn-
ing machine combining a decision tree and an SVM for intrusion
detection. The system takes prediction outputs from two mod-
els (for example, votes) and then combines them into the ﬁnal
output. This is also called ensemble learning (Zhou, 2012), in
which multiple models (called base learners) are strategically
combined to create a stronger model to solve a particular prob-
lem. De Caigny et al. (2018) designed a hybrid model based
on a decision tree in the ﬁrst stage and a logistic regression in
the second stage. The output of the decision tree is the input of
the logistic regression, the output of which is the system’s ﬁnal
output. In this paper, our proposed hybrid model MOGP-HMM
contains two models used by sequence from two tribes (i.e., the
MOGP is from evolutionaires and the HMM is from Bayesians).
We also compare it with the benchmarked SVM-HMM.

From the functional perspective, our proposed hybrid model
MOGP-HMM and the benchmark SVM-HMM can be expressed
as the classiﬁcation-HMM. The MOGP or SVM is used for clas-
siﬁcation in the ﬁrst stage while the second stage HMM is used
in ﬁnding and modelling patterns in sequential data, satisfying
Markovian property.
In the previous studies, SVMs with dif-
ferent kernels and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) have
been used in the classiﬁcation-HMM structure. For example,
the SVM-HMM has been successfully applied in speech recog-
nition (Stadermann & Rigoll, 2004; Mohameda & Nair, 2012),
metadata extraction (Zhang et al., 2008), and vision based hu-
man behaviour recognition (Han et al., 2014). The GMM-HMM
has been used in vision based human motion detection (Concha
et al., 2011; Han et al., 2014). According to Han et al. (2014),
the SVM-HMM achieves a better recognition performance than
the GMM-HMM in short video sequences because the SVM can
clearly distinguish the differences between categories in consec-
utive frames. Although the SVM has shown great success in the
previous studies, it has several limitations. First, choosing an
appropriate kernel function is always a challenging task as it re-
quires cross validation and it is data and task dependent (Auria
& Moro, 2008). Second, the SVM usually needs a long train-
In this study we aim to ﬁnd an
ing time for large datasets.

lines show how the collected sequential lifelogging data is

tus. The model can be deployed on a cloud server and pro-

alternative classiﬁer which is efﬁcient as well as robust. The
MOGP has achieved a wide range of success inclusive of ap-
plications to classiﬁcation problems (Zhang & Rockett, 2009; Ni
& Rockett, 2014; Shao et al., 2013) but it has not been used in the
classiﬁcation-HMM hybrid structure for healthcare applications.
Similar to the SVM, the MOGP is a non-parametric model which
requires fewer assumptions about the data, and consequently per-
forms better in situations where the true distribution is unknown.
However, the modelling process of the MOGP is totally differ-
ent to the SVM because it is from the evolutionaires’ tribe. In
essence, the MOGP is a tree-based algorithm, which can provide
a better visualisation graph on the solution. Also, unlike SVMs,
it is not sensitive to the choice of kernel functions and thus pro-
vides more robust and discriminative representations of sparse
data. The evolutionary process searches for a richer model space
to minimise both 0/1 loss and the size of decision trees using
Pareto dominance (Poli et al., 2008). Therefore, in this paper we
use the MOGP. Apart from the theoretical comparison between
the SVM and the MOGP here, we also empirically compare the
MOGP-HMM and the SVM-HMM (with different kernels) based
on our data in Section 4.

3 The MOGP-HMM

The proposed MOGP-HMM contains two stages: (i) a MOGP
algorithm in the ﬁrst stage; and (ii) a ﬁrst-order HMM in the
second stage. Figure 1 presents a schematic view of the MOGP-
HMM. The ﬁrst-order HMM is represented as a chain-structured
Bayesian network where Z1, · · · , ZN are the latent variables rep-
resenting the human physical activity status over a ﬁnite time
horizon t1, · · · , tN . and O1, · · · , ON are the observations ob-
tained by the MOGP algorithm based on the collected lifelog-

3.1 Classifying lifelogging data using the MOGP algorithm

In the ﬁrst stage, the MOGP takes an input vector Xn of an in-
dividual’s lifelogging data at time tn and assigns it to one of M
discrete classes representing observation states. To simplify the
notation, the observation On takes a value from a set of integers
SO = {1, · · · , M }. In the following discussion, we explain what
a GP tree is and we show how it works as a binary classiﬁer. We
then introduce how GP trees are built and how the optimal tree
models are determined under multiple objectives. Finally, we
discuss the ensemble method used to create a multi-class classi-
ﬁer.

GP algorithms use tree-based syntax to present a function f (·)
which can transform an input vector Xn = [Xn,1, · · · , Xn,d] ∈
Rd from a d-dimensional feature space into a 1-dimensional de-
cision space Y ∈ R, where the leaf nodes take the input vector,
the internal nodes specify the arithmetic operations and the root
node gives the response in the decision space. Therefore, GP
trees can be used to solve binary classiﬁcation problems. Fig-
ure 2 presents a toy example of a GP tree, in which each input
vector has three features (i.e., Xn = [Xn,1, Xn,2, Xn,3]) and
the GP tree function then gives a response yn = f (Xn) =
(Xn,1 + Xn,3) × Xn,2. If the training lifelogging data has (cid:101)N
input vectors, then (cid:101)N responses can be obtained in the decision
space. Therefore, an optimal response can be found from the set
of obtained (cid:101)N responses and be used as the threshold y∗ to clas-
sify inputs so that the misclassiﬁcation error e∗ is minimised, as
illustrated in Algorithm 1.

Similar to other evolutionary algorithms, the individuals in the
initial population are randomly generated in GP algorithms. Here

we adopt the widely used Ramped half-and-half method (Koza,
1992), which generates a full sub-tree on one half of the root and
a random tree with various size and shapes on the other. The ex-
ample tree shown in Figure 1 is the case where the left half is a
full tree while the right half is not. We also use point crossover
and mutation, as illustrated in Figure 3. Given two parents, point
crossover randomly selects a crossover point in each parent tree.
It then creates the offspring by replacing the sub-tree rooted at
the crossover point in a copy of the ﬁrst parent with a copy of the
sub-tree rooted at the crossover point in the second parent. Point
mutation randomly selects a mutation point in a tree and substi-
tutes the sub-tree rooted there with a randomly generated sub-
tree. More details about our experimental settings of GP trees
are summarised in Table 1 in Section 4.

In the evolutionary process, a GP algorithm searches for the
global optima of the speciﬁed objective function. If the misclas-
siﬁcation error is set as the only objective, the ﬁnally selected
tree model may ﬁt the training data excessively and end up over-
ﬁtting. In many machine learning and data mining techniques,
regularization is added to avoid overﬁtting (Bishop, 2007). How-
ever, this will increase the training efforts. In the paper, we use
an alternative method to reduce overﬁtting. The tree size (i.e.,
the number of tree nodes) is set as the second objective in the op-
timisation. This can preserve simpler models and improve model
generalisation. Pareto dominance is employed to compare and
rank vectors of multiple objectives. Let P = [p1, · · · , pW ] and
Q = [q1, · · · , qW ] be two W -dimensional vectors. Mathemati-
cally, P is said to (Pareto) dominate Q, denoted by P ≺ Q, if
the following two conditions are satisﬁed:

pw ≤ qw, ∀w ∈ {1, · · · , W },
pw < qw, ∃w ∈ {1, · · · , W }.

In our optimal selection, the highest rank 1 is assigned to a
tree if there are no other trees that dominate it. Trees which
are not dominated by the rank 1 tree are then assigned to rank
1. We exclude all rank 1 trees and repeat the procedure to as-
sign rank 2 to trees which are dominated by each other. Then
rank 2 trees are excluded and the procedure is repeated un-
til all tree models are assigned a rank. For example, we have

cation error and node count of ﬁve different trees: (0.213, 28),
(0.213, 67), (0.197, 85), (0.322, 15), (0.225, 50).
In the ﬁrst
round, (0.213, 28) dominates (0.213, 67) and (0.225, 50). How-
ever, (0.213, 28), (0.197, 85), (0.322, 15) do not dominate each
other, so they are assigned to rank 1 and they form the Pareto
frontier.
In the second round, (0.213, 67) and (0.225, 50) do
not dominate each other so both are assigned to rank 2. The
advantage of using the multi-objective optimisation imposes the
simplicity of the models as a form of regularisation in the opti-
misation procedure and improves the model generalisation.

The MOGP algorithm discussed so far is a binary classiﬁer. To
solve multi-class classiﬁcation problems, an ensemble method is
used to merge a number of binary classiﬁers. Speciﬁcally, as il-
lustrated in Figure 4, if there are K classes (or states) labelled
in the lifelogging data, for a class k = 1, · · · , K, a MOGP tree
can be obtained from the Pareto frontier with respect to the bi-
nary classiﬁcation problem of ’Class k’ or ’Non-class k’. There-
fore, K MOGP trees can be obtained, and they can be sorted
in ascending order based on their misclassiﬁcation errors, de-
noted by f(1), · · · , f(K). It should be noted that the notation (k),
k = 1, · · · , K, represents the index of the sorted tree model but
not the class that the tree solves. For example, f(1) can be the
tree model that classiﬁes data into ’Class 2’ or ’Non-class 2’. We
start with f(1) and classify the training data into either ’Class (1)’
or ’Non-class (1)’. The training data of the former is excluded
and the rest of data is then classiﬁed by f(2). This step is repeated
until f(K) and the data of ’Non-class (K)’ is assigned to ’Class
0’. Therefore, lifelogging data can be classiﬁed into M = K + 1
classes (or states) of observations. An advantage of our method is
that an additional class is created in the HMM observations. This
gives a ﬁner classiﬁcation of lifelogging data as well as avoids the

In the second stage, we use a ﬁrst-order HMM (Ghahramani,
2001; Bishop, 2007) to predict an individual’s physical activity
status when a sequence of observations is given. As illustrated
in Figure 1, an individual’s physical activity status at time tn is
described by the latent variable Zn, which takes the value from
a set of integers SZ = {1, · · · , K}. Latent variables are con-
nected through a ﬁrst-order Markov chain in which the distri-
bution P(Zn | Zn−1) of Zn is conditioned on the value of the
previous value Zn−1. Since there are K states, this conditional
distribution corresponds to a K × K matrix that we denote by
A, the elements of which are known as transition probabilities,
i.e,, Ai,j = P(Zn = j | Zn−1 = i) where i, j ∈ SZ. La-
tent variables are not observed directly. However, each latent
variable Zn determines an observation On through the condi-
tional distribution P(On | Zn). As there are M classes of ob-
servations, this conditional distribution corresponds to a K × M
matrix B whose elements are called emission probabilities, i.e.,
Bi,j = P(On = j | Zn = i) where i ∈ SZ, j ∈ SO. There-
fore, the following joint distribution can express the relationship
among a sequence of observations:

where Z1:N represents Z1, · · · , ZN , and P(Z1) is the initial la-
tent state probability. As there are K states of the latent variable,
the initial latent state probability can be denoted by a K × 1 vec-
tor π = [π1, · · · , πK].

The model parameters {π, A, B} can be estimated using the
Baum-Welch algorithm (Bishop, 2007).
It is essentially an
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that estimates the val-
ues of parameters to maximize P(O1:N ; π, A, B). However, the

As the observations are obtained
from the training data in the ﬁrst stage and the training data has
been labelled, the model parameters can be estimated based on
the ground truth as follows:

where the notation # counts the occurrence number and (cid:101)N is the
size of the training data, e.g., the initial latent state probability
πi is equal to the number of occurrences of state i divided by the
size of the training data.

Given observations O1,N and the model {π, A, B}, how do
we ﬁnd the latent variable sequence Z1:N that best represents
the observations? This corresponds to ﬁnding the most prob-
able sequence of latent variable states, and this can be solved
efﬁciently using the Viterbi algorithm (Bishop, 2007). Sim-
ply put, the most probable latent variable state at time tN can

4 Experiments

In this section, we introduce the collected lifelogging data, de-
scribe our experimental settings, and give an analysis of the ex-
perimental results.

4.1 Data

Our lifelogging data was collected through the Moves mobile ap-
plication,3 which uses accelerometer and GPS sensors in a mo-
bile phone to automatically record any walking, cycling, and run-
ning activities of its user. It contains the activities recorded from
10 different participants in the UK, ranging from 118 to 401 days.
For each activity, the variables (or features) steps, distance, and
duration are collected. Based on the UK national health guid-
ance (UK National Health Service, 2015), the physical activity
status is explicitly labelled as a measurement score ranging from
1 (inactive state) to 5 (active state). However, the behavioural
characteristics vary from user to user – some people live an inac-
tive life in which a highly active pattern is rarely observed while
some people moves a lot every day. To overcome the problem
that the states of an individual’s physical activity status are im-
balanced, we generate synthetic data and use them together with
the original real data in the experiments. Speciﬁcally, for each
participant, the synthetic data is only used for training the MOGP
algorithm in the ﬁrst stage, and the original real data is used in the
second stage for estimating the HMM and predicting the user’s
physical activity status over time.

The following strategy is used to create the synthetic data. Two
intermediate variables are deﬁned H = Distance/Duration

H ) and N(µR, σ2

and R = Steps/Duration. Their sample mean and standard de-
viations can be obtained from the raw data. A new duration value
can be sampled from the raw data, which can be multiplied by
N(µH , σ2
R) to create the values of correspond-
ing distance and step, where N represents Gaussian distribution.
It should be note that the generate values are truncated to be non-
negative numbers. Figure 5 presents an example of the synthetic
data and the original raw data for a participant. The classes of
physical activity status can be clearly identiﬁed and each class
has a certain amount of data. The histogram and the ﬁtted Gaus-
sian density plots of both original and synthetic data for the input
variables exhibit similar and consistent distributions. It should
be noted that our study is limited to the observations in the real
data. Gaussian or Gaussian-like distribution is simple and can
specify both central tendency and dispersion of data with param-
eters mean and standard deviation. The used left-side truncated
Gaussian distribution (Burkardt, 2014) is a popular parametric
method used to generate synthetic data when there is a lack of
real data for training models.

In order to evaluate the robustness of the proposed hybrid model,
white noise is generated at different levels ranging from 0 to 0.2
and is incorporated into the labelling process of lifelogging data.
Speciﬁcally, we follow the UK medical guidance (UK National
Health Service, 2015) to label data and add a noise term into
the variables step, distance, and duration based on their standard
deviations, respectively. Therefore, slightly different labels, i.e.,
the states of human physical activity status, are obtained under
different noise settings. This takes into consideration that doctors
may have slightly different ratings for a participant’s physical
activity status.

4.2 Experimental design

The SVM-HMM is a popular hybrid model which has been
successfully used in speech recognition and human activity be-
haviour recognition. In the experiments, we compare our pro-
posed MOGP-HMM with several SVM-HMMs. Speciﬁcally,
we investigate SVMs using different kernels including radial ba-
sis function (RBF), polynomial and sigmoid kernels, denoted by
SVM(R), SVM(P) and SVM(S), respectively. For further tech-
nical details about SVMs please refer to Cristianini & Shawe-
Taylor (2000). The corresponding hybrid models are denoted by
SVM(R)-HMM, SVM(P)-HMM and SVM(S)-HMM in the fol-
lowing discussion.

In the ﬁrst stage, the synthetic data is used. We employ the 5-
fold cross-validation method in training SVMs; and 50% of the
data for training and 50% of data for validation in obtaining the
MOGP algorithm (called the test set method). The training set-
tings of the MOGP algorithm are summarised in Table 1. The
experiments run up to 80,000 tree evaluations, each of which
generates a new tree model. The training terminates when either
of the following two conditions is met: (i) 0/1 loss converges;
(ii) the maximum iteration number is achieved. The GP trees are
initialised with ramped half-and-half method (Koza, 1992); point
crossover and mutation are used. The tree depth is set as 4, and
the tree node types include unary minus, addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and analytic quotient (Ni et al., 2013). It should
be noted that the test set method (Bishop, 2007) ensures the gen-

eralization capability of the MOGP. Regularization is difﬁcult
to implement for tree-based models as they are heuristic algo-
rithms. In broader sense, regularization for tree-based models is
proceeded by limiting the maximum depth of trees, ensembling
more than just one tree, or setting stricter stopping criterion on
when to split a node further (e.g. the minimum gain, the number
of samples). Therefore, the above training steps and settings in
Table 1 ensure the MOGP will not be over-ﬁtting. In the second
stage, the original real lifelogging data is ﬁrstly processed to ob-
tain the corresponding observations. We then employ the 10-fold
cross-validation method in training and testing the HMM, where
the data is divided into 10 equal folds – 9 folds are used for esti-
mating the parameters {π, A, B} of the HMM and the remaining
fold is used for prediction and evaluation. In the experiments, we
use the HMMlib C++ in the implementation of the HMM (Sand
et al., 2010).

4.3 Results and discussion

Figure 6 presents an example of using the MOGP-HMM for a
participant. The time series plot of the original real lifelogging
data shows the values of steps, duration, and distance over time.
The MOGP algorithm then classiﬁes the collected lifelogging
data into one of 6 classes (or states) representing the observa-
tions. The HMM then predicts the user’s physical activity sta-
tus over time based on the observations. The proposed MOGP-
HMM is compared with other three SVM-HMMs for 10 partici-
pants under 21 noise levels, which gives 840 performance results
in total. Table 2 presents the models’ performance for one user.
In machine learning theory, test error (also known as the gener-
alisation error) is a measure of how accurately a model is able
to predict outcome values on a set of data that it has never seen
before. Test error and overﬁtting are considered to be closely
related. Generally, the more overﬁtting occurs, the larger the

els, a kernel function is employed to non-linearly map the origi-
nal feature space into a kernel space where the linear classiﬁer is
trained. Thus, the optimality of the linear model holds only in the
kernel space that relies on the kernel function. Intuitively, kernels
incur different non-linearity from one to another. Each optimal
model from a speciﬁc kernel is an effective local optimum with
respect to the kernel function used. Therefore, different results
can be obtained with SVMs using different kernels. On the other
hand, the MOGP algorithm minimises empirical 0/1 loss and the
size of the tree simultaneously, leading the evolutionary process
to minimise test error. Each GP tree represents a discriminant
that maps the training data from the feature space into a decision
space while using a threshold to separate two classes. Compared
to SVMs, one advantage of GP algorithms is that the discriminant
is a syntax tree providing rich model candidates to search. The
evolutionary process is driven by the MOGP algorithm towards a
set of solutions non-dominant to each other in terms of empirical
error and complexity. The solution set has no quantitative justi-
ﬁcation related to the expected risk. As a result the optimisation
process is not as solid as SVM. Speciﬁcally, the tree size consid-
ered as a syntactic complexity measure is not as tightly coupled
to the true complexity as Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension
employed in SVM (Cristianini & Shawe-Taylor, 2000). There-
fore, the model evolved by MOGP is only a close-to-optimum
result over a larger model space. Overall, the MOGP algorithm
is a robust choice in the classiﬁcation-HMM type hybrid mod-
els as no ad-hoc kernels are required and is underpinned by its
ﬂexible non-linearity.

physical activity statuses, respectively.

all four models are close. However, the SVM(P)-HMM leads
the rankings, slightly ahead of the MOGP-HMM. Both models
are signiﬁcantly ahead of the other two models. Figure 7 pro-
vides the results of overall performance for all 10 people in our
data. The MOGP-HMM can achieve comparable performance as
SVM-HMMs as it has the second smallest average test error in
all four models.

We would like to provide some insights on the underlying differ-
ences between the MOGP algorithm and SVMs. From the per-
spective of model generalisation, test error in SVMs is propor-
tional to the combination of training error and model complexity.
Conducted from the structure risk minimisation scheme, a SVM
converges to a linear optimal solution. As for the non-linear mod-

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a hybrid model MOGP-HMM to pre-
dict human physical activity status from sequential lifelogging
data. The MOGP algorithm transforms the collected lifelogging
data into observations, which are the input of the HMM. The lat-
ter is a chain-structured Bayesian network where the latent vari-
ables represent an individual’s physical activity status over time.
Given a sequence of observations, an individual’s physical ac-
tivity status can be predicted. We validate the proposed model
with the real data collected from a group of participants in the
UK, and compare our model with several SVM-HMMs in which
SVMs use different kernels. Our experimental results show that
the MOGP-HMM can achieve comparable performance as SVM-
HMMs.

The contribution of our study is multi-fold. It contributes to the
recent use of operational research, machine learning, data min-
ing, big data and the Internet of things in healthcare. Lifelog-
ging data collection and analysis is a big data problem and the
developed model is a personalised data-driven model tailored to
individual’s physical activity pattern. We aim to achieve patient-
centred healthcare where patient will play more active roles and
be encouraged positive attitudes towards healthy lifestyles. As
illustrated in Figure 1, the proposed hybrid model can be used
as a decision support tool that provides real-time health monitor-
ing, statistical analysis and personalized advice to an individual
through portable digital devices. Therefore, the study ﬁts seam-
lessly with the current trend in the UK healthcare transforma-
tion of patient empowerment as well as contributes to a strategic
development for more efﬁcient and cost-effective provision of
healthcare. Using a MOGP algorithm in the two-stage hybrid

structure has methodological contributions. It is non-parametric
and can ﬁnd an optimal trade-off between model ﬁtness and com-
plexity by setting the tree size. Unlike SVMs, it is not sensitive
to the choice of kernel functions and thus provides more robust
and discriminative representations of sparse data. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that uses a MOGP algorithm
as a multi-class classiﬁer to construct a classiﬁcation-HMM hy-
brid model for solving sequential learning problems. Our model
can be of interest and easily adapted to other relevant domains in
business analytics such as consumer choice modelling and high
dimensional business data classiﬁcation or dimension reduction.
