Abstract 

Background:  This  study  aims  to  evaluate  the  Chicago  Teen  Pregnancy  Prevention  Initiative 

delivery  optimization  outcomes  given  policy-neutral  and  policy-focused  approaches  to  deliver 

this program to at-risk teens across the City of Chicago. 

Methods:  We  collect  and  compile  several  datasets  from  public  sources  including:  Chicago 

Department of Public Health clinic locations, two public health statistics datasets, census data of 

Chicago, list of Chicago public high schools, and their Locations. Our policy-neutral approach will 

consist of an equal distribution of funds and resources to schools and centers, regardless of past 

trends and outcomes. The policy-focused approaches will evaluate two models: first, a funding 

model based on prediction models from historical data; and second, a funding model based on 

economic and social outcomes for communities. 

Results: Results of this study confirms our initial hypothesis, that even though the models are 

optimized from a machine learning perspective, there is still possible that the models will produce 

wildly different results in the real-world application. 

Conclusions:  When  ethics  and  ethical  considerations  are  extended  beyond  algorithmic 

optimization to encompass output and societal optimization, the foundation and philosophical 

grounding of the decision-making process become even more critical in the knowledge discovery 

process.

Introduction 

The City of Chicago is a leader in the urban data science and open data movements, being one of 

only a handful of municipalities in the US with a fully-staffed team addressing complex urban 

issues  with  data  science,  advanced  analytics,  and  machine  learning.  Assuming  the  role  of  an 

external consultants to the DOIT, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH), and Chicago 

Public Schools (CPS), the goal of our study is to provide compendium of the ethical issues faced 

in HHS, and to explore the impacts of one ethical consideration in the application of data science 

and analytics on the delivery services. In 2010, the Chicago Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative 

(TPPI), was launched with the aim "to reduce teen pregnancies and improve access to care for 

adolescents."  The  TPPI  was  a  19.7  million  dollars  funded  program  by  the  U.S.  Department  of 

Health  and  Human  Services’  Office  of  Adolescent  Health  (OAH),  jointly  administered  program 

through the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and Chicago Public Schools (CPS).1 

In general, TPPI has three levels of actions: city, schools, and students’ level. In the city level, an 

action plan was created by health, policy and education experts who serve on the Adolescent 

Health Access Committee. The plan details more than 40 health measures and goals specific to 

adolescents.  The  action plan  was  distributed  to principals, partners, and  delegate  agencies.  It 

contains public awareness campaigns and creating a data repository for adolescent health. In the 

school  level,  CPS  Board  adopted  new  policy  that  mandates  comprehensive  sexual  health 

education for grades K through 12. This comprehensive curriculum should be age appropriate 

and  aligned  with  the  National  Sexuality Education  Standards.  In  the  student  level,  a  plan  was 

created with the corporation of Teen Outreach Program (TOP) and Youth Advisory Council. TOP 

 
 
is  an evidence-based  positive  youth  development  program,  shown  to  reduce teen pregnancy, 

course failure, and suspensions by half. The TOP curriculum includes lessons on clarifying values 

and  healthy  relationships,  communication/assertiveness,  goal-setting  and  decision-making, 

human  development  and  sexuality  community  service  learning.  The  curriculum  is  taught  by 

facilitators and certified by Wyman, the creator of the Teen Outreach Program (TOP).1 

Stepping  back  to  2010,  at  the  outset  of  the  TPPI,  our  goal  is  to  evaluate  program  delivery 

optimization  outcomes  given  policy-neutral  and  policy-focused  approaches  to  deliver  this 

program to at-risk teens across the City of Chicago. The policy-neutral approach will consist of an 

equal distribution of funds and resources to schools and centers, regardless of past trends and 

outcomes. The policy-focused approaches will evaluate two models: first, a funding model based 

on prediction models from historical data; and second, a funding model based on economic and 

social outcomes for communities. 

Using the points raised by Tene and Polonetsky2, this study will explore policy decisions of data 

and  decision  managers  influence  to  the  outcomes  of  analytics  projects  by  positioning  data 

science  approaches  within  specific  frameworks.  In  doing  this,  we  hope  to  advocate  for  the 

increased reflexivity of managers throughout the data science process, understanding out their 

own positionality and subjectively can have real and significant impacts on the lives of citizens. 

2  Data Collection and Problem Setup 

The  City  of  Chicago’s  TPPI  program  was  a  part  of  a  national  Teen  Pregnancy  and  Prevention 

initiative which provided funding to 75 state or local health departments and organizations.3,4 

The initiative evaluated ten programs, not including the Chicago TPPI. These ten programs served 

 
 
between 55 and 14,492 youth and provided services ranging in average cost between $68 and 

$11,541 per student. Unlike the reported programs, the TPPI in the City of Chicago was unique in 

that it did not provide intensive small-group prevention services, but instead provided city-wide 

education  and  prevention  services  targeted  at  both  male  and  female  students  -  as  such,  the 

average cost per student was calculated to be $38. This estimate was calculated based on the 

assumption  of  equal  funding  allocation  per  grant  funded  year  and  averaging  that  over  all  of 

101,008 high school aged students in the first year of program funding. We collect and compile 

several datasets from public sources including American FactFinder5 and City of Chicago Open 

Data6: 

1.  Chicago  Department  of  Public  Health  Clinic  Locations7:  City  of  Chicago  Mental  Health, 

Sexually  Transmitted  Infection  (STI)  Specialty,  and  Women  Infant  Children  (WIC)  clinic 

locations, hours of operation and contact information. 

2.  Public Health Statistics I8: This dataset contains the annual number of births to mothers 

aged 15-19  years old  and  annual birth  rate, by Chicago  community  area,  for the  years 

1999-2009. 

3.  Public Health Statistics II: This dataset contains the annual number of births to mothers 

aged 15-19  years old  and  annual birth  rate, by Chicago  community  area,  for the  years 

2010-2014. 

4.  Census  Data  of  Chicago9:  This  dataset  contains  general  population  and  housing 

characteristics (e.g., population, age, sex, race, households and housing) of Chicago area. 

5.  Chicago Public High School Locations10: This dataset contains the location of all public high 

schools within the city of Chicago. 

 
 
6.  List  of  Chicago  Public  High  Schools:  This  list  of  Chicago  public  high  schools  contains 

student  number  information  of  130  schools  which  were  active  during  the  whole  TPPI 

grant  period,  and  their  grade/total  attendance  for  each  year.  There  is  a  total  of  130 

schools. We take the total TPPI grant and divide equally over the years we get 3.94 million 

per year. 

In this study, we mainly used public health statistics and list of Chicago public high schools, in 

which statistics of each year consists of four columns — teen births, teen birth rate, teen birth 

rate lower 𝐶𝐼 and teen birth rate upper 𝐶𝐼. We adopt the teen birth rate column and for each 

community area code 𝑐  ∈ {1, . . . , 76}, a time series of data 𝑥  =   {𝑥𝑙 , . . . , 𝑥𝑙+𝛥} is generated. In 

our collected data, 𝑙  =  1999 and 𝛥  =  14. Also, we get another data flow used to estimate the 

TPPI grant spent at each school each year. After preprocessing, the  students’ number in each 

school is mapped to the number of teenagers of each community and a time series data  𝑦  =

 {𝑦𝑙 , . . . , 𝑦𝑙+𝛥}  is  generated.  Thus,  the  goal  of  our  study  is  presented  as  predict  the  teenage 

pregnancy rate 𝑥𝑟 given the above two time series 𝑥 and 𝑦 which are either directly or indirectly 

correlated with the teenage pregnancy rate of each community. 

3  Methods 

In  this  study,  we  will  focus  on  the  exploration  of  usage  of  the  autoregressive  model.  Dataset 

collected in this study are mostly presented in the format of time series, which inspires us to 

consider the use of autoregressive (AR) model under the assumption that output variable and its 

previous values are linearly dependent as shown in (1). 

 
 
𝑙

𝑥𝑡 = ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑥𝑡−1 + 𝜖

𝑖=1

(1) 

where 𝑤𝑖 , 𝑖  =  1, . . . , 𝑙  is  the  parameter  controlling the  influence  of  “momentum”  value  over 

current  value  and  𝜖  is  white  noise.  AR  model  has  several  variants  including  ARMA11 

(autoregressive–moving-average  model)  which  combines  both  autoregression  and  moving 

average,  and  ARX12  (autoregressive  exogenous)  model  which  consider  both  data’s  previous 

values and related exogenous data flows. Apart from the historical data of teenager birth rate 

from 1999 to 2009 in different communities in Chicago, we have the TPPI spending strategy plan 

for different schools in Chicago. Taking into account that in the real-world scenario TPPI grant is 

supposed to be spent to reduce the teenager pregnancy rate, then by assuming a negative linear 

correlation between TPPI grant money and teenager pregnancy rate, we combine the data flow 

of historical TPPI grant spending strategy into the existent AR model and generate a series of data 

which fit the definition of ARX model as shown in (2). 

𝑥𝑡   +   𝑤1𝑥𝑡−1   + ⋯ +   𝑤𝑙 𝑥𝑡−𝑙   =   𝑏1𝑦𝑡−𝑢   + ⋯ +   𝑏𝑣𝑦𝑡−𝑢−𝑣 

⇒ 𝑥𝑡   =   −𝑤1𝑥𝑡−1 − ⋯ −   𝑤𝑙 𝑥𝑡−𝑙   +   𝑏1𝑦𝑡−𝑢   + ⋯ +   𝑏𝑣𝑦𝑡−𝑢−𝑣 

(2) 

where  𝑥  =   {𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑖 , . . . }  is  the  time  series  of  historical  teen  birth  rate,  and  𝑦  =

 {𝑦1, . . . , 𝑦𝑖 , . . . } is the time series of TPPI grant every year. 

4  Evaluation and Discussion 

Based on how many historical records are considered, i.e., the value of 𝑙, 𝑢, and 𝑣, we construct 

and train different autoregressive models. In the first experiment, AR model is applied to the time 

series  of  teenager  birth  rate  to  observe  if  different  data  points  are  linear  dependent.  In  the 

 
 
 
second  experiment,  ARX  model  is  applied  to  analyze  the  relatedness  between  TPPI  grant 

allocation and teenager birth rate. 

4.1  Relatedness between Historical Teenager Birth Rate Data 

In  this  section,  we  explore  the  relatedness  among  time  series  of  historical  teen  birth  rate  to 

understand  if  there  does  exist  a  linear  relation  among  them  as  shown  in  the  AR  model. 

Meanwhile, it’s helpful for us to understand that TPPI grant worked as expected, that is, reducing 

teen birth rate. Under this experiment settings, we train five models with 𝑙  ∈   {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. First, 

overall correlation coefficient (𝑅2) score is evaluated for five models and is shown in Figure 1. 𝑅2 

value steadily increases when models are fed more data from historical years. And there exists 

an exactly linear fit in time series of teen birth rates when 𝑙 reaches five. That means, given five 

years historical data of teen birth rates, an autoregressive model can almost perfectly predict the 

teen birth rate in a certain area. Secondly, we compute the 𝑅2 values for different models for 

different areas and list the top ten best-predicted areas and corresponding 𝑅2 scores in Table 1. 

From the result, for some community areas such as Edgewater, Douglas, AR models perform well 

even when pretty few years of historical data are considered. 

Based  on the  above  results,  we  obtain  a  conclusion  that  for  a  certain  community area,  linear 

relatedness exists among the time series of teen birth rates. Also, considering that the model 

does the prediction without considering the actual TPPI grant allocation and still obtains a stable 

linear combination. This shows that either TPPI grant allocation is stable distributed for each year 

or it is not very effective in influencing the teen birth rate.

4.2  Relatedness between Teenage Birth Rate and TPPI Grant Allocation 

In this section, we explore the relatedness between two time series: history data of teen birth 

rate and historical data of TPPI grant allocation records, and plan to understand if they are linearly 

dependent as shown in the ARX model. Specifically, we fix 𝑢 to 1, that is, using only one historical 

data. Also, we choose only overlapped years between two time series, which is from 2010 to 

2014, as data ingest. Then four models are trained considering different historical years, i.e., ⟨𝑙  =

 1, 𝑣  =  1⟩, ⟨𝑙  =  2, 𝑣  =  1⟩, ⟨𝑙  =  2, 𝑣  =  2⟩ and ⟨𝑙  =  1, 𝑣  =  2⟩. Overall 𝑅2 score is evaluated 

for the four models as shown in Figure 2. When either of two parameters (𝑙 and 𝑣) is larger than 

 
 
 
 
one, these two time series will almost perfect fit to a linear equation, which implies hidden linear 

dependences. 

In this case, it is important to understand how TPPI grant contribute to the control of teenage 

birth rate for each community area. Table 2 shows how the teen birth rate is influenced by the 

last year TPPI grant allocation. For example, every one thousand dollars spent in Greater Grand 

Crossing will help to decrease 5.9 in teen birth rate for next year. Results also shows that Greater 

Grand Crossing are in top 10 in all the four models, and the rank value for Irving Park is very close 

to zero in most cases. This proves that TPPI fund might not be equally effective to all community 

areas.

5  Conclusion 

Results of this study confirms our initial hypothesis, that even though the models are optimized 

from a machine learning perspective, there is still possible that the models will produce wildly 

different  results  in  the  real-world  application.  In  the  application  of  data  science  to  urban 

contexts, specifically health and human service delivery, given the expansive impact that these 

services, or denial of service can have, it is important for policymakers and programmers to be 

reflexive  in  regard  to  structure  not  only  the  algorithm,  but  the  philosophical  foundations 

underpinning the algorithms, as those too have significant impact on social well-being. 

When  ethics  and  ethical  considerations  are  extended  beyond  algorithmic  optimization  to 

encompass output and societal optimization, the foundation and philosophical grounding of the 

decision-making process become even more critical in the knowledge discovery process. Given 

the scope and long-term intergenerational impact of health and human services at the city-wide 

level, the aim of this project was to evaluate how changes in the initial stages of the knowledge 

discovery  process,  creating  policy-neutral  and  policy-focused  algorithms  effect  the  social 

outcomes.  Using  a  series  of  autoregressive  (AR)  models  on  geolocated  population  and 

demographic data from the US Census and Chicago Public Schools layered with historical City of 

Chicago  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  teen  pregnancy  data  the  results 

 
 
 
demonstrated  that  even  with  nearly  perfect  algorithmic  optimization,  the  social  impacts  and 

outcomes can vary widely.
