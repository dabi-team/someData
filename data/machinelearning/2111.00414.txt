Abstract

Recent jet and jet substructure measurements at the LHC, and of machine-learning-based
tagging techniques are presented using proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS
and CMS experiments at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. These measurements are crucial for
precise tests of electroweak and pQCD calculations and searches for physics beyond the Stan-
dard Model. The measurements are compared with several Monte Carlo event generators
predictions which provide valuable input to the tuning of perturbative and non-perturbative
models and to constraining model parameters of advanced parton-shower Monte Carlo pro-
grams.

1 Introduction

In this document, an overview of recent jet and jet substructure measurements at the LHC, and
of machine-learning (ML) based tagging techniques are presented. Analyses are performed using
proton-proton (pp) collision data recorded at the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] experiments at a center-
s) = 13 TeV. Comparisons of the results with various theoretical predictions are
of-mass-energy (
presented.

2 Measurement of the Lund jet plane using charged particles

A double-differential cross-section measurement of the Lund jet plane of primary jet emissions is
performed using data collected with the ATLAS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity
(Lint ) of 139 fb−1 [3]. A two-dimensional space spanned by ln(1/z) and ln(1/θ ), where z is the
momentum fraction of the emitted gluon relative to the primary quark or gluon core and θ is the
emission opening angle. This space is called the Lund plane (LP). The LP is not an observable but
it can be approximated by using the softer (harder) proto-jet to represent the emission (core) in
the original theoretical depiction. For each proto-jet pair, at each declustering step of jets formed
using the Cambridge/Aachen algorithm, an entry is made in the approximate LP (henceforth, the

‘primary Lund jet plane’ or LJP) using the observables ln (1/z) and ln (R/∆R), R is the jet radius
parameter, and ∆R measures the angular separation. Using this grooming procedure, individual
jets are represented as a set of points within the LJP. The schematic representation of the LJP is
shown in Figure 1 (left). It is observed that varying the default angle-ordered to dipole parton-
shower (PS) model in Herwig 7.1.3 (hadronization model in Sherpa 2.1.1) results in differences of
up to 50% in the perturbative hard and wide-angle emissions (softer and more collinear emissions
at the boundary between perturbative and non-perturbative regions). Varying the matrix element
(ME) from leading order (LO) in Pythia 8.230 to next-to-leading order (NLO) in Powheg+Pythia
8.230 causes small changes of up to 10% in the region populated by the hardest and widest-angle
emissions.

The measurement is performed on an inclusive selection of dijet events, with a leading jet
) > 675 GeV and pseudorapidity (|η|) < 2.1. Particle-level charged
transverse momentum (pT
> 500
hadrons and their reconstructed tracks are also used. Tracks are required to have pT
MeV and must be associated with the primary vertex with the largest sum of track p2
T in the
event. The average number of emissions in the ﬁducial region is measured to be 7.34 ± 0.03
(syst.) ± 0.11 (stat.). The data are compared with predictions from several Monte Carlo (MC)
generators for four selected horizontal and vertical slices through the LJP. Figure 1 (middle) shows
the LJP region, where emissions change from wide-angled to more collinear, the distribution passes
through a region sensitive to the choice of PS model, and then enters a region which is instead
sensitive to the hadronization model. The differences between PS (hadronization) algorithms
implemented in Herwig 7.1.3 (Sherpa 2.2.5) are notable at large (small) values of kT , where
the two models disagree most signiﬁcantly for hard emissions reconstructed at the widest angles
(soft-collinear splittings at the transition between perturbative and non-perturbative regions of
the plane). The Powheg+Pythia and Pythia predictions only differ signiﬁcantly for hard and wide-
angle perturbative emissions, where ME corrections are relevant. No prediction describes the data
accurately in all regions, the Herwig 7.1.3 angle-ordered prediction provides the best description
across most of the plane. This measurement illustrates the ability of the Lund jet plane to isolate
various physical effects, and will provide useful input to both perturbative and non-perturbative
model development and tuning.

3 Study of quark and gluon jet substructure in dijet and Z+jet events

A measurement of jet substructure observables describing the distribution of particles within
quark- and gluon-initiated jets is performed with the CMS detector corresponding to Lint of 35.9 fb
−1 [4]. The ﬁducial phase space regions are deﬁned by selecting Z boson with atleast one inclusive
jet in the Z+jet event sample and the atleast two jets in the dijet event sample at reconstructed
> 30 (15) GeV and rapidity (| y|) < 2.4. Figure 1 (right) shows that
(generator)-level jets with pT
Z+jet sample is dominated by 64–76% quark jets and central and forward dijet jets are dominated
by 69–72% (55–68% ) gluon (quark) jets at low (high) pT . In this analysis, measurements of a
set of ﬁve observables λκ
β are also reported that distinguish quark- and gluon-initiated jets. The
generalized angularities are deﬁned as:

0.5), width (λ1
servables are Les Houches angularity (LHA) (λ1

(pD
0). The LHA, width, and thrust are infrared and collinear safe and particularly sensitive
T
to the modelling of perturbative emissions in jets, while the other two have larger contributions
from non-perturbative effects. Experimental data distributions unfolded to the particle-level. The
mean of LHA, width, and thrust distributions decreases as a function of the jet pT in both the Z+jet
and central dijet regions, as a result of constituents being located closer to the jet axis due to the
larger Lorentz boost at higher pT . This trend is displayed by all generators. In the gluon-enriched
sample, HERWIG7 CH3 [5] – [6], PYTHIA8 CP5 [7], PYTHIA8 CP2 [7], and SHERPA [8] generally
provide a better description than either HERWIG++ [9] – [10] or MG5+PYTHIA8 [11] – [12]. In
the quark-enriched sample, MG5+PYTHIA8 provides the best description, followed by HERWIG7,
PYTHIA8 CP2, SHERPA, HERWIG++, and PYTHIA8 CP5. Improved modelling of gluon jets at the
cost of poorer modelling of quark jets is observed. The ratio of the means in the central dijet and
Z+jet region are also compared. There is similar data-to-simulation agreement for AK8 versus AK4
jets, charged-only versus charged+neutral and groomed versus ungroomed observables. At low
pT , the ratio is found to be signiﬁcantly larger than unity for LHA, width, thrust, and multiplicity,
)2. It indicates that these observables have signiﬁcant separation
and signiﬁcantly smaller for (pD
T
power between quark and gluon jets and clear need for improvements in the MC. The best over-
all data-to-simulation agreement for the ratio is achieved by SHERPA, followed by HERWIG++,
MG5+PYTHIA8, HERWIG7 CH3, PYTHIA8 CP2, and PYTHIA8 CP5.

4 Mass regression of highly-boosted jets using graph neural networks

A novel technique based on machine learning for reconstructing the true mass in hadronic decays
of highly Lorentz-boosted top quarks and W, Z, and Higgs bosons [13] is presented. The technique,
commonly known as mass regression, is based on ParticleNet [14] – [16], a graph neural network
using an unordered set of jet constituent particles as the input. In ParticleNet Mass Regression,
the training sample consists of an equal mix of QCD and Higgs bosons events, generated with
MadGraph5 (hard scattering) and Pythia8 (PS and hadronisation) with 2018 data conditions. The
Higgs boson sample has been generated with an equal mix of H → bb/cc/qq (q=u,d,s) decays

and its MC mass has been taken from a uniform distribution in the [15, 250] GeV range. The
groomed jet mass obtained from the “modiﬁed mass drop tagger” algorithm, also known as the
= 0.1,
“soft drop” algorithm [17] – [19], with angular exponent β = 0, soft cutoff threshold zcut
is used to remove soft, wide-angle radiation from the jet. The soft drop mass is calibrated in
a top quark-antiquark sample enriched in hadronically decaying W bosons. The target mass is
deﬁned as the “soft drop” mass of the associated truth particle-level jet for the QCD sample and

150 GeV for H → bb jet compositions is shown in Figure 2 (left). The resolution degrades for
the heavier quark ﬂavors due to the larger presence of neutrinos. In addition, there is signiﬁcant
improvement in tails with the mass regression, in particular at M≈0, where the soft drop algorithm
incorrectly identiﬁes the large R jet as single-prong. The effective resolution (σ

computed as half of the minimum interval containing the mode and 68% of the area under the

5 Boosted hadronic vector boson and top quark tagging

The latest development and optimization of taggers to identify high-pT (boosted) hadronic de-
cays of W and Z boson and top quarks, as well as their calibration is performed [20] using data
=80 fb−1. W
collected by the ATLAS experiment between 2015 and 2017 that correspond to Lint
and Z boson taggers are deﬁned using selection criteria on individual hadronic jet properties (cut-
β=1.0
) [21], and
based algorithms) such as large-R jet mass, energy correlation function ratio (D
2
the ghost-associated track multiplicity (nt r ack). Top quark taggers are deﬁned using deep neural
networks that use jet substructure moments as input. The W and Z taggers are evaluated in MC
simulation and data for jets with 200 GeV < pT
< 2.5 TeV and the top tagger for jets with 350
GeV < pT
< 4 TeV. The additional cut on nt r ack has been found to improve background rejection
for a ﬁxed signal efﬁciency due to the rejection of jets seeded by gluons. In the case of the sig-
nal efﬁciency, the scale factors are derived using t¯t events in the muon+jets channel while γ+jet
and multijet events are used to derive scale factors for quark and gluon-initiated background jets
covering the pT ranges [200, 2000] GeV and [500, 3500] GeV, respectively. The tagger signal efﬁ-
ciencies are extracted from distributions of the leading large-R jet mcomb from candidate t¯t events
that are partitioned in pT bins covering the ranges [350, 1000] GeV for top tagging and [200,
600] GeV for W tagging. The mcomb is the weighted sum of masses from calorimeter information
and from the mixed calorimeter and tracking information. The deep neural-network scores for
inclusive top taggers are shown in Figure 2 (middle) for events that pass the top selection in data
and MC. There is good agreement between data and MC across the region within the uncertain-
ties considered. Overall it is observed that the signal efﬁciency scale factors range between 0.8
and unity and background efﬁciency scale factors are close to unity for all the taggers considered.
Figure 2 (right) shows signal efﬁciency scale factors the for the inclusive top taggers. A method
of extrapolating scale factors and uncertainties using only MC is employed to extend the range of

substructure. Here, we presented an overview of several recent measurements which are sensitive
to different theoretical approaches and useful to constrain the model parameters of advanced
Monte Carlo programs.
