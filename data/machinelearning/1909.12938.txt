Abstract - 
evident that a method capable of forecasting and analysing the future of these players’ on-field antics shall assist the management to great 
extent. In a simulated environment like Fantasy Premier League, enthusiasts from all over the world participate and manage the players 
catalogue for the entire season. Due to the dynamic nature of points system, there is no known approach for the formulation of dream team. 
This study aims to tackle this problem by using a hybrid of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Recurrent Neural 
Networks (RNNs) for time series prediction of player points and subsequent maximisation of total points using Linear Programming (LPP). 
Given the player points for the past three seasons, the predictions have been made for the current season by modelling differently for ARIMA 
and RNN, and then creating an ensemble of the same. Prior to that, proper data preprocessing techniques were deployed to enhance the efficacy 
of prepared model. Constraints on the types of players like goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards along with the total budget were 
effectively optimised using LPP approach. The validation of the proposed team was done with the performance in ongoing season, where the 
players outperformed as expected, and helped in strengthening the feasibility of the solution. Likewise, the proposed approach can be extended 
to English Premier League by official managers on-field.

Introduction 

Since it’s invention way back in the mid-nineteenth century, Football (as the Europeans call it) has continually gained 
popularity across the world. Being a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball, it has more 
than 250 million followers in over 200 countries [1]. In the modern era, the game has reached a stage where any activity of every 
player is under supervision at all times. Consequently, the prediction of their performances is of utmost significance when it 
comes to the success of individual teams. There exist different measures of performance for footballers, namely, goals for 
forwards, assists for midfielders, saves for goalkeepers or standardised points system. This paper deals with the aforementioned 
idea of forecasting the future antics of a player using the points attained by him in previous encounters based on his on-field 
performance.

Fantasy Premier League 

English Premier League (EPL) is an English professional league for men’s association football clubs [2]. It is contested by 20
clubs and operates on a system of promotion and relegation. Owing to its eminence in sports arena as the most-watched sports
league in the world, it generates high revenue and has therefore, garnered broad attention from prominent industrialists and
businessmen. Fantasy Premier League (FPL), a simulated version of EPL, is a chance for football enthusiasts to create their own
squad of 15 players and battle across the entire world to atop the leaderboard. Organised by EA Sports, FPL aims at providing
lucrative prizes and heaps of appreciation to the winners. The study is focussed at helping a novice aficionado to obtain a
head-start when contesting FPL, and exhibit an approach better than the traditional naive ones.

1.2.

Dream Team Formulation 

As indicated in 1.1, the main objective of FPL is to maintain a team of 15 players whose performance will be the sole
determiner of the leaderboard position. Ideally, the squad is formulated after proper analysis of footballers across all 20
participating clubs. Given a fixed budget of £100 Million, the team must consist of 2 Goalkeepers, 5 Defenders, 5 Midfielders
and 3 Strikers. Additionally, it should generate the highest team score possible, which in turn, depends on the game-weeks in
which at least one player has stepped on the field. 

Using the points for the past years, time series forecasting techniques were leveraged to predict next year’s performance. To
be robust in approach and consider both linearity and non-linearity, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were considered for modelling. After obtaining the points for the entire roster, Linear
Programming (LPP) basics were applied to adhere to all constraints and finalise a suitable starting dream team. 

1.3.

Sports Analytics 

Relevant and historical statistics, if properly used, can provide competitive advantage to a team or an individual. Coming into
Moneyball [3], where analytics was used to build a competitive team on a minimal
the forefront after the release of 2011 film,
budget, this field has never looked back. This paper covers both on-field and off-field aspects, as it seeks to move from
performance analysis to managerial decisions.  

One of the ill-effects though has been its impact on sport gambling. It has escalated to another level as betters now have more
information than ever at their disposal to aid in decision making. Being inevitable as such, increased companies and startups in
this domain are not helping the cause at all.  

2.

Related Work 

When it comes to Fantasy Football, there is no known published work which covers the aspects of team formulation or
point-based analytics. There have been some researchers who have talked about the performance of referees and the effect of age
[4-5]. Paolo Cintia is a researcher in Sports Science and deliberates upon the harsh rule of goals [6] and evaluates the
performance of football teams using a network-based approach [7]. Significant research on player hamstring history [8] and high
running during football games [9] has helped in better management of the bench by football managers. 

The only aspect of this study that has seen some prior research is Performance Analysis (PA). Craig Wright [10] talks about
its application in the football coaching process, whereas, Isidoro [11] measures the productivity and efficiency of the football
teams in EPL. This paper aims to create an everlasting remark in the field of football analytics as it introduces the highly accurate
neural networks approach. 

Over the past several decades, much effort has been devoted to the development and improvement of time series forecasting
models (Zhang [12]). Traditional statistical models including moving average, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA are linear in
that predictions of the future values are constrained to be linear functions of past observations. Because of their relative
simplicity in understanding and implementation, linear models have been the main research focuses and applied tools during the
past few decades. To overcome the restriction of the linear models and to account for certain nonlinear patterns observed in real
problems, several classes of nonlinear models have been proposed in the literature. These include the bilinear model [13], the
threshold autoregressive (TAR) model [14], and the autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) model [15]. Although
some improvement has been noticed with these nonlinear models, the gain of using them to general forecasting problems is
limited [16]. Because these models are developed for specific nonlinear patterns, they are not capable of modeling other types of
nonlinearity in time series. More recently, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been suggested as an alternative due to their
flexible nonlinear modeling capability. However, a totally unexplored category of neural networks called the Long Short-Term
Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) is the main focus of research here, as it is combined with ARIMA which
captures linearity with a great efficiency. 

After time series forecasting, it is imperative to focus on utilisation of linear programming to get the best out of everything.
Jahangir and Mehrzad [17] have evaluated the performance of Iranian football teams using Data Envelopment Analysis, which is
a linear programming-based technique. Apart from that, there have been significant contribution across different spheres but
lesser in sports arena. To keep it simple, this study uses the novel optimisation approach which takes in some constraints and
maximises the objective function by Simplex method. To decrease the computational time, the solver was appropriately chosen. 
This paper takes into account all of the prior contributions by knowledgeable researchers and aims to move forward by
delivering concrete results in sports performance analytics. More of original concepts and ideas have been proposed and
presented. This should open opportunities for research into individual player tracking using other factors like demographics, food
habits, training time, sleep time, medical health status, etc.

Data 

The data utilised in the research was collected from the official Fantasy Premier League website [18] which has all the details

about various players taking part in the English Premier League for the past five to six years.  

Besides official FPL, few

Kaggle kernels [19] were used to cross-check the historical data points to avoid any loss or
misinterpretation of data. There were two kinds of datasets that were fetched using Data Scraping techniques in
. Master
Python 3
​
FPL dataset consisted of mapping of players onto their position, team and cost. The shape of this dataset was estimated to be
(Number of Players i.e. 584, 5). A sample of the same can be seen in Table 1.

For time series forecasting, historical data was of as much importance. This was extracted year-wise for all gameweeks that 
each player played. For the following study, the data was used for 3 seasons, namely, 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. This yearly 
dataset listed player-wise sorted data along with gameweek, player ID, team, weekly points and running sum of points (Table 2).

by taking different constraints into consideration.

Proposed Methodology 

The entire process of generating the dream team can be broadly divided into three phases as shown below (Fig. 1):

Data Preprocessing 

As mentioned by Han [20], today’s real-world databases are highly susceptible to noisy, missing, and inconsistent data due to
their typically huge size (often several gigabytes or more) and their likely origin from multiple, heterogeneous sources.
Low-quality data will lead to low-quality mining results. The appropriate principles, suiting the data format and type of data,
were applied for data preprocessing.

First of all, the missing values were identified in the

. Columns for all gameweeks were

created, whether or not the player played. If he didn’t play, zero score was assigned for that week. This ensured the consistency
of rows between Points and Master FPL dataset.  
The next important step was to populate the

ID field to ensure that correct player's performance is being tracked. For the same,
team-wise examination was performed. Those players were removed who had joined EPL this season as their historical data
wouldn’t be available. Also, the dormant footballers, i.e., the ones who had left the league sometime in the past three seasons
were cleaned up. This eliminated around 44% players from the entire roster.  

Chronologically arranged, the points dataset had 114 values of points for a single player (38 for each season). These shall be

treated as separate time series for each player, and future modeling be done accordingly.

Time Series Modeling 

This section uses historical values and associated patterns to predict the future activity. For improved accuracy of predictions, 

two different models were tried separately and their results were ensembled to come up with a hybrid version: 

ARIMA
, or Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average 
​
, or Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks 
LSTM-RNN
​

•
•
Each one is able to cover up for the shortcomings of the other one. ARIMA’s major limitation is the pre-assumed linear form
of the model. LSTM ensures that the nonlinearity is captured to a large extent, and the model is not biased entirely towards linear
components. Meanwhile, LSTM relies heavily on persistence and thus, arises the need for huge datasets for lesser error of
forecast. As 114 values are not too huge, it may exhibit some deviations from perfection. ARIMA barges in here to make sure
that these deviations are not that significant. 

Time series data of each player (326 in total) was used for predictions for the next one year, i.e. next 38 values. ARIMA and
LSTM-RNN were executed separately and then their results mixed in some proportion (p1 and p2) which shall be explained
ahead. These 38 gameweek points were added then to find the total points for every player in the upcoming 2016-17 season.

Linear Optimisation 

Commonly known as Linear Programming (LP), this seeks to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model whose
requirements are represented by linear relationships. An objective function is maximised or minimised, with respect to certain
constraints which vary from situation to situation. 

Once the predicted points for all 326 players were obtained as explained in 4.2, there was a need to maximise the total points

This approach of optimisation helped a great deal in reducing the effort after time series forecasting was done. Proper 
understanding of the problem is necessary for formulation of objective function and constraints. Once done, it is a matter of 
input-output.

Experimental Results 

This section focuses on showcasing the results obtained after running time series models on FPL dataset. Owing to large 

number of time series generated, the process of prediction was automated after setting optimal parameters. LSTM-RNN works on 
a large architecture and explaining the entire process is out of the scope of this study. However, for fitting ARIMA model to the 
points time series data, three-stage procedure of model identification, estimation of model parameters and diagnostic checking of 
estimated parameters was employed. To determine the possible persistence, the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial 
autocorrelation function (PACF) were used. Using Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), the best fitted model has been identified 
out of the various competing models. For demonstration purpose, the seasonal and nonseasonal components of 5 random players 
are indicated in Table 5. Generally, lower AIC value indicates the presence of a better fit.

 In this way, the optimal coefficients for the two models were determined for every player. Reduction in RMSE directly meant 

better predictions. 

Keeping future formulation of dream team in perspective, a common 

 was identified which would significantly reduce 
(p1,p2)
​

the computational time for a new player and ensure trade-off between time and accuracy (Fig. 4). For the preprocessed master 
FPL dataset, the final proportions came out to be 

 after rounding off to the nearest tenths.

Discussions and Intelligence Gained 

After successful time-series forecasting, linear optimisation was used to obtain the dream team. The squad of fifteen has been 

deliberated upon in this section. 

Solution to (1) gave the maximum possible score within the stipulated budget which came out to be 

better understanding of the performing players, some new features were computed by assuming that the player shall play almost 
the same matches as he played in 2015-16 season. These were: 

•
•
•

 (Points per match) - Average points a player is expected to score in a match. The higher, the better. 
PPM
​
CPP
 (Cost per point) - Helped in determining most valuable players, i.e. cheaper and more points. The lower, the better. 
​
CPI (Cost-point index) - A combination of PPM and CPP, this was calculated for those players expected to play more
than 20 matches. PPM and CPP were scaled down to lie between 0 and 1, and then added by giving equal weightage to each.
This weightage can be varied for the desirable quality in the team.

It is quite evident that this team is full of high performers and some cost-efficient players. LPP approach intuitively helps in 
achieving the trade-off. Apart from the dream team, there were some players with exceptional CPI worth-mentioning (Table 8).

This study helped in better understanding of performances in EPL, and following intelligence was gained: 
•

Loyalty was discovered as a major factor in enhancement of a player’s performance. For the dream team, average stay
period came out to be 5 years, clearly indicating that the more you play for a particular team, the better your chances of excelling. 
As expected, most of the players were natives of England, but surprisingly, the other big majority belonged to Belgium,

•

expected to be a supplier of great young talent. 

•

On an average, Goalkeepers performed best on CPI scale followed by defenders. Maximum variation could be seen

among the forwards as the sport witnesses mixed array of players in that position. 

•

Hull City performed poorly on CPI, whereas, Chelsea and Arsenal were the table toppers, producing match-winners in

all positions from GLK to FWD. 

•

Team’s gameplay can be estimated from the eleven that it fields on the pitch. Manchester City are unbeatable when it

comes to defence, and Chelsea are unstoppable with their sublime list of attacking players. 

For cross-validation and establishment of efficacy of the approach followed, this team was tracked for 2016-17 season and the

RMSE between predicted points and actual points was calculated.

The hybrid performed with a reasonably good accuracy exhibiting an error of only

87 points on the negative side for the
entire team, i.e. over-forecasting. The precise inability of the model to pick out random absence from the playing team (sharp
decrease to zero) was attributed as the reason for this. Model that assists in predictions for non-continuous time series may
further help in reducing this inflated error. Some of the players in Dream team won Player-of-the-Month awards also, thereby,
strengthening the feasibility of the proposed solution.

Conclusion and Future Work 

The increasing use of Analytics and Statistics in the field of Sports has intensified the global competition and paved way for
remarkable development. Through this study, the aim has been to introduce the latest concepts of Machine Learning to find
insights about the footballers playing in English Premier League. Powerful predicting nature of Long Short-Term Memory
Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) has been leveraged to identify the non-linear patterns in points-based time series data
of the players with historical data and supposed to play in the ongoing season 2016-17. As the amount of data increases, the
accuracy of  model shall improve, thereby establishing the persistence of RNN over time. 

Fantasy Premier League (FPL), a simulated version of the actual Premier League has given common man the opportunity to
don a Manager’s hat and rally the troops as per his wishes. This formulation of dream team gives a unassailable head-start to any
novice fanatic. It takes into account all constraints with the help of properly designed Linear Programming environment. Another
unexplored domain is tracking of player’s performance beforehand. In today’s fiercely competitive world, it’s imperative to
ensure that highly efficient personnel are deployed at all times. This model shall aid the manager in figuring out the low points in
a player’s season, and accordingly making the necessary adjustments, either by pushing him or replacing him. Therefore, this
study stands at the intersection of machine learning and sports analytics, and seeks to facilitate extensive and varied research in
this field. 

Future work can be expanded to other football leagues in the world for better feedback on the proposed model. As the study
hinges mostly around working with time series data, it’s usage in other sports like Runs in Cricket, Baskets in Basketball and
Winners in Tennis can be explored and studied. More features about the player could be used in understanding his worth as an
asset to the team. Features like fitness levels, eating habits, demographics, records against specific oppositions, etc. can be of
great help. Fitness and commitment levels may assist in enhanced determination of the number of matches the player can be
expected to play. Further research into models that take into account, sudden peaks or non-continuous time series data can be
looked upon. Accurate forecasting of player’s playing time shall always remain the key. Importantly, it should be ensured that
this analysis doesn’t end up in wrong hands and result in malpractices i.e. sports betting or gambling. The concerted goal of
aggrandizing the management of sports activities across the globe with the help of Analytics and Mathematics should be
gradually realised, leading to revamped viewership for the billions.
