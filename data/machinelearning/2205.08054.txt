Abstract 

Background and Purpose: Radiomics features are used to identify disease types and predict 

therapy outcomes. However, how the radiomics features are different among different anatomical 

structures  has  never  been  investigated.  Hence,  we  analyzed  the  radiomics  features  of  22 

anatomical structures in the head and neck area in CT images.  Furthermore, we studied whether 

CT  radiomics  can  classify  anatomical  structures  of  the  head  and  neck  using  unsupervised 

machine-learning techniques. 

Materials  and  methods:  We  obtained  IMRT/VMAT  treatment  planning  data  from  36  patients 

treated for head and neck cancers in a single institution. There were 1357 contours of more than 

22 anatomical structures drawn on planning CTs. We calculated 174 radiomics features using the 

SIBEX program. First, we tested whether the radiomics features of anatomical structures were 

unique enough to classify all contours into 22 groups. We then developed a two-stage clustering 

technique  to  classify  22  anatomic  structures  into  sub-groups  with  similar  physiological  or 

biological characteristics.  

Results: The heatmap of 174 radiomics features of 22 anatomical structures showed a distinct 

difference  among  tumors  and  other  healthy  structures.  Radiomics features  have  allowed  us to 

identify the eyes, lens, submandibular, pituitary glands, and thyroids with over 90% accuracy. The 

two-stage  clustering  of  22  structures  resulted  in  six  subgroups,  which  shared  common 

characteristics such as fatty and bony tissues. 

Conclusions:  We  have  shown  that  anatomical  structures  in  head  and  neck  tumors  have 

distinguishable radiomics features. We could observe similarities of features among subgroups 

of  the  structures.  The  results  suggest  that  CT  radiomics  can  help  distinguish  the  biological 

characteristics of head and neck lesions.

Introduction 

Radiomics is increasingly used for quantitative characterization of diagnostic images, particularly 

as  potential  biomarkers  for  evaluating  cancer  therapy,  including  radiation  therapy.  Many 

applications of radiomics are focused on predicting the cancer therapy outcome and toxicity with 

the radiomics features as biomarkers or predictors (1-14). Furthermore, there are many studies 

in which radiomics features were used to differentiate tumor from healthy tissue (15, 16), classify 

the tumor type (17, 18), and determine the tumor grade (19-21). Some investigated differences in 

radiomics features of tumors in different organs (22). Applications of radiomics to discover the 

genomics from diagnostic images are another active area, and it is called radiogenomics (23). In 

addition, there are emerging applications for detecting microenvironments such as hypoxia (24, 

25) and studying tumor immune biology (26). 

Despite  the  immense  activities  in  radiomics  applications  in  radiology  and  radiation 

oncology, as evidenced by the number of publications on the topic, to the author's knowledge, no 

one  investigated  the  differences  of  radiomics  features  among  different  organs  and  structures, 

including tumor lesions. Hence, we studied the variability of radiomics feature values by analyzing 

the  radiomics  features  of  anatomical  structures  in  head  and  neck  areas.  In  this  study,  we 

addressed three questions: 

1.  Are radiomics features of tumors different from those of healthy structures in the head and 

neck area? 

2.  Do anatomical structures and tumors have structure-specific radiomics features? 

3.  Can anatomical structures be classified into subcategories based on their functions and tissue 

types using radiomics? 

To answer question #3, we needed to categorize M anatomical structures in the head and 

neck  area  into  J  categories  or  structure  groups,  which  may  share  common  physiological  and 

4 

 
biological characteristics using radiomics features of N samples obtained from treatment planning 

CT image data. In this study, we solved these problems by an unsupervised machine learning 

(ML) technique, i.e., clustering algorithms. A simple application of the algorithm could not classify 

all contours into J categories. Hence, we developed a two-stage clustering method to accomplish 

the goal. In Stage-1, we obtained six clusters or subgroups from N samples or contours belonging 

to one of M anatomical structures. Using the known anatomical structure of those contours, we 

calculated  the  probabilities  that  a  contour  is  assigned  to  one  of  six  subgroups.  Using  the 

probabilities as parameters for the stage-2 clustering, we classified M anatomical structures into 

J categories. 

The  results  will  demonstrate  the  ability  of  radiomics  in  differentiating  the  biological 

processes  taking  place  in  different  parts  of  the  head  and  neck  having  various  types  of  tissue, 

cellular structures, and physiological functions, which are hidden under the medical images or CT 

images  in  this  study.  Hence,  this  study  will  help  us  enhance  our  confidence  in  the  radiomics 

features as potential biomarkers of treatment response and radiation toxicity. 

Materials and Methods 

Patient data 

We obtained the CT image data sets for 36 patients treated in a single institution, the All India 

Institute  of  Medical  Sciences  (AIIMS)  in  Delhi,  India,  for  head  and  neck  cancers  using  the 

IMRT/VMAT  technique.  The  demographic  data  and  tumor  locations  of  these  patients  are 

summarized in Table 1. All patients were scanned using Philips Brilliance Big Bore CTs with the 

following scanning parameters: helical, 120kVp, 450mAs, 512x512 pixels, slice thickness: 1, 2, 

or 3mm, FOV: between 240 mm x240 mm and 600 mm x 600 mm, and 16 bits per pixel. For the 

current study,  we  chose  22  anatomical  structures,  including  92 gross  tumor  volumes (GTV), a 

5 

 
 
total of 67 right and left parotids, and 35 mandibles. See Table 2 for the complete list. There were 

1357  contours,  but for  the  current  study,  we  chose  1175  contours  of  22  anatomical  structures 

mentioned  above.  Experienced  radiation  oncologists  segmented  all  structures  for  treatment 

planning. See Figure 1 for an example of CT images showing the contours of GTV, right and left 

parotids, and mandibles.

Radiomics 

We calculated 174 radiomics feature values by the SIBEX software (27), which complies with the 

recommendations of the International Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) (28). There are 

11 categories of radiomics features, as shown in Table 3, which lists the number of features in 

each category. The complete list of all features can be found in Appendix A. The details of feature 

calculation algorithms are discussed in the IBSI report (28). The radiomics calculations were done 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
using three processing parameters: Fixed Bin Number (FBN) with 32 bins (FBN32) and Fixed Bin 

Size (FBS) with 25 bin widths (FBS25) and ten bin widths (FBS10).

Clustering 

The feasibility of clustering 1175 contours of 22 anatomical structures into subgroups was studied 

in four steps, as summarized in the process diagram of Figure 2. In the first step (the second from 

the top), the number of radiomics features used for clustering was reduced from 174 radiomics 

features to p composite features using the principal component analysis (PCA) method (29). In 

the second step (the stage-1 clustering), we used a clustering algorithm to assign 1175 contours 

to  one  of  the  K  clusters  or  subgroups.  Here  the  contours  of  an  anatomical  structure  could  be 

assigned  to  more  than  one  subgroup.  By  counting  the  number  of  contours, 

of  a  known 

structure, i, which was assigned to a subgroup, k, by the clustering, we can generate a frequency 

𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖,𝑘𝑘

distribution  of  the  number  of  contours  of  a  structure  assigned  to  the  subgroups.  In  step  3,  we 

calculated  the  normalized  frequency,  or  probability,  of  contours  of  anatomical  structure,  i, 

assigned to a subgroup k,

representing tissue type or other similarities among the structures in the same structure group. 

Figure 2: Process map of the analysis procedure 

For the clustering analysis, radiomics feature values were normalized using the Z-score 

or linear range methods (29). For the latter, the values were scaled to the range of 0 and 1. We 

tested varying numbers of principal components p, i.e., p = 2 to 174, for the stage-1 clustering 

analysis.

After step 1, we generated a heatmap, which presented the distributions of 174 radiomics 

features for all 1175 contours. Then, the stage-1 clustering was done using the k-means algorithm 

(29). Next, we evaluated the clustering performance by varying the number of subgroups K from 

2 to 22. To assess the performance of the stage-1 clustering for K=22, we calculated the clustering 

accuracy  of  22  anatomical  structures.  The  stage-2  clustering  was  made  using  two  clustering 

methods:  the  k-means  and  the  hierarchical  clustering,  which  generated  dendrograms  (29). 

Additionally,  we  tested  the  consensus clustering  method  (30,  31)  as  an alternative  to the two-

stage clustering method. We did several tests to select optimal hyper-parameters and algorithms 

by changing analysis options and parameter values for the sensitivity of the final results on the 

variations. Note that there is the following relationship between the within-cluster sum of squares 

of  cluster  k  (

),  the  between-cluster  sum  squares  (BCSS),  and  the  total  cluster  sum  of 

squares (TSS):

𝐾𝐾
𝑘𝑘=1

Note that the second term on the right side of Eq. (3) is the total between-cluster sum of squares 

(TWCCS). We defined the ratio of the between-cluster sum squares (BCSS) and the total cluster 

sum of squares (TSS), denoted by  Λ:

Λ =  

The  Λ  value  in  percentage  varied  from  0  to  100%.  Note  that  a  smaller 

 means  tighter 

clustering of its members in cluster k. Hence, a larger Λ implies a better clustering. The k-means 

𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑘𝑘

routine  of  the  R  package  prints 

   and  Λ (32).  Therefore,  the  performance  with  different 

calculation parameters could be evaluated by TWCCS or Λ.

Results 

Selection of parameters and methods 

Table 4 shows the parameter values and methods used to optimize the analysis method 

for the data presented in this study. The binning method used to calculate the radiomics features 

affects the calculated absolute values. We tested the fixed bin size (FBS) with 10 bins and 25 

bins  and  the  fixed  bin  number  (FBN)  with  25  bins.  Based  on  our  test  results  and  a 

recommendation made in Bettineli et al.(27), we chose the FBS with 25 bins (FBS25). 

Before the principal component analysis, we scaled the radiomics feature values by the 

Z-score and Linear-range methods. We found that the former resulted in a slightly better clustering 

accuracy Λ than the latter. Hence, we decided to use the Z-score scaling method for the current 

study. 

There should be a sufficient number of principal components (PC) to closely represent the 

parameter space represented originally by 174 radiomics features. Since the smaller number of 

PC is desirable for the subsequent clustering analysis, we examined the results by varying the 

number of PCs, p, from 2 to 174. We found 5 PCs could model 70% of data points and decided 

to use this number for the rest of the study. The relevant data will be presented in the later section. 

The  cluster  analysis  such  as  the  k-means  method,  requires  the  user  to  preselect  the 

number of clusters, K. Ideally, there should be 22 clusters since there are 22 anatomical structures. 

However,  as  shown  later  in  Figure  5,  the  clustering  accuracy  represented  by  the  parameter 

TWCSS  decreases  as  K  increases  and  eventually  becomes  less  sensitive  to  K.  Hence,  in  the 

following analysis, we set K to 6. 

We tested three methods among many clustering techniques: k-mean and hierarchical for 

the stage-2 clustering. Our tests indicated that these methods gave the same results. Hence, we 

used  the  hierarchical  clustering  method  for  the  rest  of  the  study,  which  was  more  robust  and 

11 

 
informative than the k-means method. A significant disadvantage with the k-means algorithm is 

its need to preselect the K value.

Radiomics features of anatomical structures 

Table 2 lists the average volumes and average CT numbers of 22 anatomical structures. These 

were  two  of  the  radiomics  features  calculated  by  the  SIBEX  program  (MorphologicalFeatures-

Volume and IntensityDirect-Mean). The table also includes the function and tissue type of each 

anatomical structure.  

The  heatmap  in  Figure  3  shows  the  quantitative  distribution  of  174  radiomics  features 

among  all  1357  contours,  which  were  reordered  according  to  anatomical  structures.  One  can 

visually  confirm  that  some  structures  have  different  radiomics  feature  values  from  others.  For 

example, 252 contours from the bottom of the diagram are GTV, CTV, or PTV. The parotids are 

from 253-319, and the mandibles are from 320-354. Parotid and mandible had radiomics values 

distributed very differently from GTV, CTV, and PTV. For example, the differences can be more 

clearly observed in Figures 4 (a), (b), and (c), which show the plots of radiomics feature values of 

the  esophagus  and  oral cavity  in  comparison  to GTV.  A  data point  on the  solid  oblique  line  in 

Figure  4  means  that  two  structures  in  the  x  and  y-axes  had  the  same  feature  values.  The 

12 

 
 
distributions  of  points,  each  of  which  was  one  contour,  showed  apparent  differences,  but  to 

different magnitudes among the anatomical structures.

A scatter plot of 1175 contours using the first two principal components, PC1, and PC2, is shown 

in Figure 6, where different colors indicate different anatomical structures. We can observe weak, 

but recognizable concentrations of some structures in a specific area in the figure. For example, 

GTV indicated by black dots are in the middle PC2 range, although those points widely spread 

out in the PC1 direction. PTV showed a distribution similar to GTV but in the lower PC2 area. 

Cochleae and mandible were clustered in specific regions of the plot.

The  scree  plot  in  Figure  7  shows  the  percent  variations  or  the  proportion  of  variance 

explained (PVE) as a function of the number of the principal components. The graph indicates 

that the first few components may be sufficient for clustering contours. In particular, the five largest 

components accounted for 74% of the variation (or the cumulative proportion of 0.74). Hence, we 

chose five PCs for the stage-1 clustering analyses.

The PCA program ranked the radiomics features based on the importance of the radiomics 

features for good clustering. Table 5 shows the ten most important features. It is noted that the 

7th feature was IntensityDirect/Mean, which was the mean CT numbers.

Clustering of anatomical structures 

Stage-1 

First,  the  1175  contours  were  clustered  into  22  subgroups  (or  K=22)  with  the  k-means 

clustering method with five PCs. Ideally, all elements or contours of each anatomical group should 

be  in  the  same  subgroup.  Figure  8  presents  the  clustering  results,  where  the  horizontal  axis 

indicates the 22 anatomical structures, and the vertical axis indicates the 22 subgroups or cluster 

groups. The red color shows almost all contours are assigned to a specific group. For example, 

the box at the crossing of structure #4 (parotids) and subgroup 4 has a reddish color, implying a 

sound performance of the algorithm in assigning the parotid contours to this subgroup. In fact, 53 

out  of  67  parotid  contours  were  assigned  to  subgroup  4  (79.1%  accuracy).  Structure  #5 

(mandible) had an even higher accuracy with 30 out 35 correct assignments, or 85.7% accuracy. 

Contours  with  an  accuracy  higher  than  90%  were  structures  #6  (Eyes),  #7  (Lens),  #15 

(Submandibular), #18 (Pituitary gland), and #19 (Thyroid gland). See Table 6 for the complete list. 

It is noted that the contours of tumors such as GTV, CTV, and PTV, were assigned to multiple 

subgroups.  Some  subgroups  had  contours  belonging  to  several  anatomical  structures.  For 

example, subgroup 9 included the contours of structure #8 (Lacrimal glands), #9 (Optic nerves), 

and #12 (Chiasm).

Next, we clustered 1175 contours into six structure groups (K=6) by the k-means method 

with  5  PCs.  The  Λ  value  of  this  clustering  was  76.9%.  Most  of  the  22  structures  could  not  be 

classified into a single group, but the contours of one structure belonged to several subgroups. 

This  can  be  seen  in  Figure  9,  where  the 

 of  anatomical  structure,  i  and  the  k-th  subgroup 

defined by Eq. (1) are plotted using bar graphs for all 22 structures. It is noteworthy that structure 

𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑘𝑘

#19 had all contours in subgroup 1 (red). The contours of structure #5 solely belonged to subgroup 

2 (orange). Most of the contours of structures #6, #13, and #14 belonged to subgroup 3 (coral). 

The  contours  of  structures  #7  and  18  were  in  subgroup  4  (amber).  Meanwhile,  GTV  was 

distributed over all six subgroups.

Stage-2 

To classify 22 anatomical structures based on the data presented in Figure 9, we used 

the  hierarchical  clustering  method  (Stage  2  clustering).  Here,  22  anatomical  structures  were 

assigned to one of six structure groups. The clustering result was expressed by a dendrogram 

shown  in  Figure  10.  We  can  recognize  six  structure  groups,  considering  the  number  of  tree 

branches at the 3rd level indicated by a red horizontal line. Table 7 summarizes the clustering 

result  where  22  anatomical  structures  were  assigned  to  one  of  the  six  structure  groups.  The 

results  show  structures  #1  (GTV),  #17  (Esophagus),  #20  (Larynx),  #21  (Oral  cavity),  and  #22 

(TMJ)  made  up  one  structure  group.  Structures  #5  (Mandible)  and  #10  (Cochleae),  which 

contained  bony  tissue,  could  represent  another  structure  group.  Structures  #2  (CTV)  and  #3 

(PTV)  formed  the  structure  group  2.  Furthermore,  the  dendrogram  of  Figure  10  tells  that  the 

parotids  (#4)  and  submandibular  (#15),  which  are  salivary  glands,  were  in  the  same  structure 

group.

Discussion 

The radiomics features of structures containing tumors, i.e., GTV, CTV, and PTV, were noticeably 

different  from  other  structures  containing  only  healthy  tissue.  In  particular,  CTV  and  PTV  had 

common features distinguishable from others, as indicated by the formation of one structure group 

after the two-stage clustering.  

The clustering using radiomics features successfully differentiated contours belonging to 

some anatomical structures. Among the 22 structures that we examined in this study, the contours 

of eight structures were grouped in the same subgroup with higher than 80% accuracy. Meanwhile, 

the algorithm failed with GTV, CTV, PTV, and Lips with an accuracy lower than 30%. 

This study developed a two-stage clustering method to assign 1175 contours into structure 

groups.  In  Stage  1,  the  1175  contours  were  clustered  into  K  groups  using  five  principal 

components  derived  from  174  radiomics  features.  The  analysis  showed  that  K=22  lead  to 

21 

 
 
 
 
sufficiently accurate clustering of contours into 22 structure groups. Furthermore, after clustering 

1175  contours  into  six  subgroups  (K=6),  we  did  the  second  clustering  (Stage-2  clustering)  to 

cluster  22  anatomical  structures  into  six  structure  groups.  The  resulting  cluster  dendrogram 

showed that GTV, esophagus, and oral cavity belonged to the same structure group. CTV and 

PTV formed one independent structure group because these contours contain the GTV volume 

and  surrounding  tissue,  including  bony  structures.  Two  bony  anatomical  structures  of  the 

mandible and cochleae formed one structure group. Three other structure groups consisted of 

several anatomic structures with some common features. The results could be partially explained 

by examining the anatomical structures' mass density. However, even the density is not only the 

characteristics common to the structures grouped in the same structure group. For example, as 

seen in Table 7, the average CT number of structure groups 2, 4, and 6 are similar, but those are 

created with different anatomical structures. 

In a recent review paper, Larue et al. (33) briefly discusses applications of radiomics to 

normal tissue. The primary utility of normal tissue radiomics is to assess the change in normal 

tissue to injuries related to cancer treatment and development using a series of imaging studies. 

The  current  study  opens  a  potentially  new  direction.  One  can  use  radiomics  features  strongly 

associated  with  the  physiological  and  biological  characteristics  of  normal  tissue  or  organs  to 

detect functional changes of the organs through images. 

In this study, we used an unsupervised algorithm to classify anatomical contours. We can 

also use supervised ML algorithms such as support vector machines or even convolution neural 

networks to classify the contours into predefined categories and generate models for predicting 

the  anatomical  location  from  the  CT  images.  Such  a  study  could  identify  important  radiomics 

features specific to each structure category.

Conclusions 

We  showed  that  the  CT  radiomics  exhibited  recognizable  differences  among  twenty-two 

anatomical structures in head and neck areas.  The novel two-stage clustering algorithm could 

categorize  the  anatomical  structures  into  subgroups,  sharing common  biological functions  and 

tissue types. In conclusion, our results implied that the radiomics of CT images could help discover 

the  differences  of  biological  processes,  microenvironment,  and  cellular  structures  among 

anatomical structures in the head and neck.
