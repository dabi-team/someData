Abstract—Hybrid beamforming (HBF) design is a crucial stage
in millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-user multi-input multi-
output (MU-MIMO) systems. However, conventional HBF meth-
ods are still with high complexity and strongly rely on the quality
of channel state information. We propose an extreme learning
framework to jointly optimize transmitting
machine (ELM)
and receiving beamformers. Speciﬁcally, to provide accurate
labels for training, we ﬁrst propose an factional-programming
and majorization-minimization based HBF method (FP-MM-
HBF). Then, an ELM based HBF (ELM-HBF) framework is
proposed to increase the robustness of beamformers. Both FP-
MM-HBF and ELM-HBF can provide higher system sum-rate
compared with existing methods. Moreover, ELM-HBF cannot
only provide robust HBF performance, but also consume very
short computation time.

proposed to optimize hybrid beamformers for mmWave MU-
MIMO systems, in which the network takes the imperfect
channel matrix as the input and produces the analog and digital
beamformers as outputs. However, this work is only feasible
for single stream transmission and the exhaustive search HBF
algorithm is with extremely high computational complex-
ity. Furthermore, methods in [6], [8] using multiple large
dimensional layers constructions may consume tremendous
computation time in training phase, which is impractical with
the hardware constraint (e.g., limited computational capability
and memory resources) of mobile terminals.

From above observations, we propose an extreme learn-
ing machine (ELM) framework with easy implementation to
jointly optimize transmitting and receiving beamformers. The
main contributions are summarized as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION

R CENTLY, hybrid beamforming (HBF) design for mil-

limeter wave (mmWave) multi-user multi-input multi-
output (MU-MIMO) systems has been receiving increasing
research attention due to the advantages of using less fully
digital (FD) beamformers and providing high beamforming
gain to overcome the severe pathloss at affordable hardware
cost [1]–[4]. Generally,
the main challenges of the HBF
optimization problem for mmWave MU-MIMO systems are
the non-convex constraints of analog beamformers and the
inter-user interference. Some optimization based methods have
been proposed to optimize the hybrid beamformers by using
following FD methods: block diagonalization zero-forcing
(BD-ZF) [4], [5], minimum mean square error (MMSE) and
weighted MMSE (WMMSE) [3]. For example,
to design
hybrid beamformers, a WMMSE based orthognal matching
pursuit (OMP) method is proposed in [3] and a BD-ZF based
exhaustive search method is proposed in [6]. However, above
approaches either require perfect channel state information
(CSI), or high computational capability.

Recent development in machine learning (ML) provides a
new way for addressing problems in physical layer communi-
cations (e.g., direction-of-arrival estimation [7], HBF design
[6], [8] and channel estimation [9]). ML based techniques
have several advantages such as low complexity when solv-
ing non-convex problems and the ability to extrapolate new
features from noisy and limited training data [10]. In [6],
a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is ﬁrst

S. Huang, Y. Ye and M. Xiao are with the Division of Information Science
and Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden
(e-mail: {shahua, yu9, mingx}@kth.se).

• New HBF optimization algorithms: We decouple the
HBF optimization problem to two sub-problems. Unlike
the work in [3] that minimizes MMSE, we ﬁrst propose
an factional programming (FP) based FD beamform-
ing algorithm that directly maximizes the system sum-
rate. With FD beamformers, we then propose a low-
complexity majorization-minimization (MM) based algo-
rithm to jointly optimize hybrid beamformers. Finally, the
convergence and computational complexity of proposed
algorithms are analyzed. We show that above proposed
methods can achieve higher sum-rate than conventional
FD beamforming and HBF methods.

• Robust and low-complexity ML based HBF design:
We propose an easily implemented ML based HBF
framework (i.e., ELM-HBF) to jointly estimate the pre-
coders and combiners. Different from conventional HBF
methods, of which the performance strongly relies on the
quality of CSI, our learning based approach can achieve
more robust performance since ELM are effective at
handling the imperfections and corruptions in the input
channel information. We show that, for 64 transmit an-
tennas, ELM-HBF can achieve 50 times faster prediction
time than WMMSE-OMP-HBF [3], and 1200 times faster
training time than CNN-HBF [6].

II. SYSTEM MODEL

We consider an mmWave downlink MU-MIMO system, in
which a base station (BS), equipped with Nt antennas and NRFT
radio frequency (RF) chains, is communicating with K inde-
pendent users (UEs). Each UE is equipped with Nr antennas
and NRFR RF chains to receive Ns data streams simultaneously.
To guarantee the effectiveness of the communication carried by
the limited number of RF chains, the number of the transmitted
streams is constrained by K Ns ≤ NRFT ≤ Nt for the BS, and
Ns ≤ NRFR ≤ Nr for each UE. The received signal for the k-th
UE is given by

k INr) is the additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) at the k-th UE. FBB,k ∈ CNRFT×Ns and
WBB,k ∈ CNRFR×Ns denote the baseband digital precoder and
combiner, respectively. FRF ∈ CNt×NRFT and WRF,k ∈ CNr×NRFR
are the analog precoder and combiner for the k-th UE, respec-
tively. Both FRF and WRF,k are implemented using analog
|[FRF]n,m| = 1
phase shifters with constant modulus, i.e.,
and |[WRF,k]n,m| = 1 [1]. To meet the total transmit power
constraint at the BS, precoding matrices FRF and FBB,k are
constrained by (cid:205)K
= K Ns. The mmWave
MIMO channel between the BS and the k-th UE, denoted
as Hk, can be characterized by the Saleh-Valenzuela model
[3]. From the above, the system sum-rate when transmitted
symbols follow a Gaussian distribution is given by

III. HBF DESIGN WITH FP AND MM METHOD

In what follows, we maximize the achievable system sum-
rate by jointly optimizing hybrid beamformers, i.e., Bk =
{FRF, FBB,k, WRF,k, WBB,k }, ∀k. The optimization problem can
be stated as

where FRF and WRF,k denote the feasible sets of analog
beamformers which obey the constant modulus constraints for
FRF and WRF,k.

Obviously, the sum-rate maximization problem (P1) is non-
convex and NP-hard with respect to Bk, ∀k due to the coupled
variables in the matrix ratio term in (2) and the constant
modulus constraints of analog beamformers. To make this
problem tractable, we ﬁrst transform problem (P1) to an easily

Then, problem (P1) can be rewritten as

and the non-convex constraints of analog beamformers, it is
still hard to solve problem (P2) directly. Thus, we propose a
two-step approach to solve problem (P2). In the ﬁrst step, we
mainly focus on maximizing R by jointly optimizing the FD
beamformers (i.e., D = {Fk, Wk, ∀k}). Then, problem (P2) is
reformulated as

Note that problem (P3) is bi-convex which can be effectively
solved with alternating optimization (AO) methods. According
to AO methods, the solutions of problem (P3) can be obtained
iteratively, where in iteration i + 1, the variables are updated

show that minimizing the Euclidean distance between the FD

systems [3]. In what follows, we ﬁrst optimize the hybrid
beamformers at the BS by minimizing the Euclidean distance
between FD beamformers (i.e., Fk, ∀k) and hybrid beamform-
ers (i.e., FRFFBB,k, ∀k). Letting FBB = [FBB,1, ..., FBB,K ], the
problem is formulated as

Though problem (P4) can be solve based on OMP and
manifold optimization methods,
the OMP method cannot
achieve high system performance and the manifold optimiza-
tion method is with extremely high complexity [6]. Thus, to
jointly design the hybrid beamformers at the BS, we will
solve problem (P4) based on the AO framework, where the
analog precoder FRF is ﬁrstly optimized by by ﬁxing FBB,k, ∀k.
Hence, (P4) can be rewritten as

solve non-convex problem (P5), we use an MM method. The
basic idea is to transform original problem (P5) into a sequence
of majorized subproblems that can be solved with closed-form
minimizers. At ﬁrst, according to lemma 2 in [12], we can ﬁnd
a valid majorizer of f (FRF; FBB) at point F(i)

of the normalization step is refereed to [2], [13]. With above
closed-form solutions in (16) and (17), we summarize the MM
based HBF algorithm in Algorithm 2. The hybrid beamformers
at UEs can be designed following a similar approach to that
at the BS, and details are omitted here due to space limitation.
We then summarize the convergence and main complexity of
Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 in the following theorems.

Since there is only one hidden layer in ELM, with random-

According to [2], the closed-form solution for (P7) is

(21)

From above, it can be concluded that ELM is with very
low complexity since there is only one layer’s parameters to
be trained and the weight of output layer (i.e., β ) is given in
closed-form.

V. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

In this section, we numerically evaluate the performance of
our proposed methods, and compare them with four state-of-
the-art methods: BD-ZF-FD [5], BD-ZF-HBF [4], WMMSE-
OMP-HBF [3] and CNN-HBF [6]. Uniform planar array [3]
is used, and the number of cluster and array for mmWave
channels are set to 5 and 10, respectively. We select K =
3, Ns = 2, Nr = 16 and L = 4000. The ELM is fed with
100 channel realizations and for each channel realization, 100
noisy channels are obtained by adding synthetic noise with
different powers of SNRTrain ∈ {15, 20, 25} dB.

Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b present the achievable sum-rate of
various beamforming methods versus SNR with perfect and
imperfect CSI, respectively. With perfect CSI, it shows that
all the proposed methods outperform others in Fig. 2a. Both
FP-MM-HBF and ELM-HBF can approach the sum-rate per-
formance of proposed fully digital beamforming scheme, i.e.,
FP-FD. With imperfect CSI, Fig. 2b shows that learning based
methods (i.e., ELM-HBF and CNN-HBF) achieve higher sum-
rate than other optimization based methods. We observe that
ELM-HBF provides better performance than CNN-HBF and
is very close to the performance of FP-FD. The reason is that
the weight matrices of ELM are given in closed-form and are
much easier to be optimized those that of CNN.

Table I shows the computation time for different HBF
methods. The computation time of a learning based method
is characterized by ofﬂine training time and online prediction
time. A performance comparison among two common activa-
tion functions for ELM, i.e., sigmoid function and parametric
rectiﬁed linear unit (PReLU) function [2], is provided. 1000
noisy channel samples for 10 channel realizations are fed
into the learning machines, and 100 noisy channel samples
are used for testing. We select SNR = −8 dB, Nr = 16,
SNRTrain = SNRTest = 10 dB. We can see that ELM-HBF
with different activation functions always achieve higher sum-
rate than other methods. Among all methods, ELM-HBF with

Proof. The proof of convergence is similar to that in [2], and
omitted here for space limitation. The main complexity at each
iteration of Algorithm 2 comes from ﬁnding the maximum
eigenvalue of Qk and the pseudo inversion of FRF. That is
(cid:3)
O(IinK(NtNRFT)3 + NtN 2

RFT).

Above proposed HBF algorithm (denoted as FP-MM-HBF)
is iterative algorithm and still suffers from high computational
complexity as the number of antennas increases. Furthermore,
since the proposed HBF algorithm and existing optimization
based algorithms are linear mapping from the channel ma-
trices and the hybrid beamformers, they require a real-time
computation, and are not robust to noisy channel input data.
Thus, a learning based approach to address these problems is
proposed in the following section.

IV. HBF DESIGN WITH ELM

In what follows, we present our ELM framework for joint
hybrid precoders and combiners design, shown in Fig. 1.
There is only one hidden layer in ELM, the weights of input
nodes and bias for the hidden nodes are generated randomly.
We assume that the training dataset is D = {(x j, t j)| j =
1, . . . , N }, where x j and t j are sample and target for the j-
th training data. Speciﬁcally, the j-th training data is deﬁned

No = NtNRFT + K(NrNRFR + Ns(NRFR) + NRFT)), WBB =
[WBB,1, ..., WBB,K ], and WRF = [WRF,1, ..., WRF,K ]. The
beamformers in t j are obtained by Algorithms 1 and 2.
According to [14], [15], the output of ELM related to sample

PReLU consumes the shortest prediction time. For instance,
as Nt = 64, it can achieve 50 and 10 times faster prediction
time than WMMSE-OMP-HBF and BD-ZF-HBF, respectively.
Moreover, CNN-HBF takes much longer training time than
ELM-HBF. For instance, ELM-HBF with PReLU can achieve
1200 times faster training time than CNN-HBF.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
An ELM framework is proposed to jointly design the hybrid
precoders and combiners for mmWave MU-MIMO systems.
We show that proposed methods can provide higher sum-rate
than existing methods. Moreover, the proposed ELM-HBF can
support more robust performance than CNN-HBF and other
optimization based methods. Finally, for Nt = 64, ELM-HBF
can achieve 50 times faster prediction time than WMMSE-
OMP-HBF, and 1200 times faster training time than CNN-
HBF. Thus, ELM-HBF is with much lower complexity and
might be more practical for implementation.
