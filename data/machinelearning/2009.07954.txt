Abstract

Monitoring long-term landslide activity is of importance for risk assessment and land management. Daytime airborne
drones or very high-resolution optical satellites are often used to create landslide maps. However, such imagery comes
at a high cost, making long-term risk analysis cost-prohibitive. Despite the widespread use of open-access 30m Landsat
imagery, their utility for landslide detection is often limited due to low classiﬁcation accuracy. One of the major challenges
is to separate landslides from other anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we produce landslide maps retrospectively from
1998 to 2017 for landslide-prone and highly populated Taiwan (35,874 km2). To improve classiﬁcation accuracy of
landslides, we integrate nighttime light imagery from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and the
Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), with multi-seasonal daytime optical Landsat time-series, and digital
elevation data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer (ASTER). We employed
a non-parametric machine-learning classiﬁer, random forest, to classify the satellite imagery. The classiﬁer was trained
with data from three years (2005, 2010, and 2015), and was validated with an independent reference sample from
twelve years. Our results demonstrated that combining nighttime light data and multi-seasonal imagery signiﬁcantly
improved the classiﬁcation (p<0.001), compared to conventional methods based on single-season optical imagery. The
results conﬁrmed that the developed classiﬁcation model enabled mapping of landslides across Taiwan over a long period
with annual overall accuracy varying between 96% and 97%, user’s and producer’s accuracies between 73% and 86%.
Spatiotemporal analysis of the landslide inventories from 1998 to 2017 revealed diﬀerent temporal patterns of landslide
activities, showing those areas where landslides were persistent and other areas where landslides tended to reoccur after
vegetation regrowth. In sum, we provide a robust method to detect long-term landslide activities based on freely available
satellite imagery, which can be applied elsewhere. Our mapping eﬀort of landslide spatiotemporal patterns is expected
to be of high importance in developing eﬀective landslide remediation strategies. Please ﬁnd the published version at:

1. Introduction

From 1990 to 2017,

landslides resulted in many
casualties and caused roughly USD 4.5 billion of economic
losses worldwide (EM-DAT 2018). Approximately 58%
of deaths and 69% of economic losses occurred in East
and Southeast Asia (EM-DAT 2018). East and Southeast
Asia, one of the fastest urbanizing regions in the world,
is currently experiencing rapid built-up area expansion
(Schneider et al. 2015). Recent deadly events causing
many thousands of casualties in densely populated regions,
include the 2013 Uttarakhand landslides in India (183
persons/km2) (Martha et al. 2015), the 2008 Sichuan
landslides in China (170 persons/km2) (Chigira et al.

imagery (e.g., Quickbird, IKONOS, WorldView) (Herv´as
et al. 2003; Pradhan et al. 2016; Stumpf and Kerle
2011; Keyport et al. 2018). Studies have shown that
object-based classiﬁcation of images at <1m resolution,
such as Quickbird and GeoEye-1, which utilize the
geometry and texture of objects, can yield high overall
accuracy (above 85%) in landslide mapping (Li et al.
2015; Stumpf and Kerle 2011). Nevertheless, retrospective
mapping of landslide occurrence from VHR imagery is
costly and does not allow tracing landslides before the late
1990s, when the ﬁrst commercial VHR imagery became
accessible. Repetitive observations with dense satellite
time-series such as from Aqua/Terra MODIS at 250m
resolution are cost-free but impose substantial limitations
for detecting landslide due to the low spatial resolution.

In contrast,

freely accessible medium-resolution
satellite imagery, such as Landsat (30m) and SPOT
(approximately 10m) imagery provide temporal coverage
over several decades and are widely used to study
land-cover change. Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation
Index (NDVI) and Normalized Diﬀerence Water Index
(NDWI) derived from multispectral imagery are commonly
used to diﬀerentiate rock-,
and mud-covered
landslides from vegetation and water bodies (Chen et al.
2013; Singh and Singh 2016; Chen and Lin 2018).
However, Landsat-like imagery alone usually resulted in
moderate classiﬁcation accuracies (Barlow et al. 2003; Yu
and Chen 2017). Even when geomorphological parameters
derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) were used
as ancillary data, the commission error and omission error
for landslide detection can be as high as 30% (Hong
et al. 2016; Yu and Chen 2017). The major challenge
related to the use of Landsat-like multispectral imagery
comes from the separation between landslides and the
surrounding environment, as spectral signatures from
landslide occurrences and anthropogenic landscapes are
often similar. Human activities such as agricultural land
use, forest clearcutting and constructions in hazard-prone
zones in East and Southeast Asia, therefore, pose speciﬁc
challenges regarding the accuracy of landslide detection
(Borghuis et al. 2007; Martha et al. 2012).

images can substitute missing information (e.g.

in optical satellite imagery) (Pohl and Van Genderen
1998). While many landslide mapping eﬀorts were made
on event-based bi-temporal change detection (H¨olbling
et al. 2015; Tsai et al. 2010; Rau et al. 2007), methods
which use time-series imagery for monitoring ongoing
processes have been developed in the past decade.
For instance, NDVI time-series were used for adaptive
change calculation, allowing the separation between
permanently non-vegetated and post-event landslide areas
in diﬀerent geographic settings (Behling et al. 2014;
Golovko et al. 2017). To monitor the geomorphological
process of slow-movement landslides, time-series based
optical imagery approaches have also been developed for
retrieving surface displacements (Pham et al. 2018; Stumpf
et al. 2017). Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry
(InSAR), known for its ability in dealing with atmospheric
noise and monitoring deformation, was also found to

While multi-seasonal Landsat images have been used

tightly associated with population density, income level

For instance, MODIS imagery combined with nighttime
light data enhanced classiﬁcation accuracy of urban areas
(Sharma et al. 2016). Thus, we assume that by adding
nighttime light data a classiﬁer can better exclude such
human activities from the areas aﬀected by landslides,
thereby overcoming the limitations of optical daytime
reﬂectance data. The Defense Meteorological Satellite
Program (DMSP) nighttime light data in combination
with data from the more recent Visible Infrared Imaging
Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) are available retrospectively,
which combined with Landsat imagery provide a great
potential to map landslides into the past. We are unaware
of any studies that tested the suitability of nighttime light
data to support automated landslide detection.

2. Study area

Our study area is mainland Taiwan with an area
of 35,874 km2,
located in the Western Paciﬁc Ring of
Fire, with frequent earthquakes and comprising 75%
mountainous regions (Fig. 1). Despite a rugged terrain,
is densely populated with 610 people per km2.
it
Hilly terrain, earthquakes and precipitation are the
main underlying drivers of landslides. Taiwan has an
average annual precipitation of 2,500mm, varying between
mountainous regions (max 4,800mm) and plains (min
1100mm) (Fig. 1). Due to its geographical positioning in
a sub-tropical zone in the Paciﬁc, Taiwan annually suﬀers
from on-land tropical cyclone strikes (so-called typhoons)
three-four times a year. Among the historical typhoons,
disasters related to Typhoon Morakot (7 to 9 August 2009)
produced an accumulated rainfall of 2,777 mm (Ge et al.
2010), landslides and debris ﬂows, resulting in nearly 700
deaths and approximately 4.7 billion USD in damage.

extracted several remote sensing variables from Landsat
time-series, DEM, and nighttime light data. We used
cloud-free pixels and developed pixel-based composites of
images (layerstacks) (Section 3.1). To adopt a supervised
classiﬁcation, we created training and validation sample
sets from visually validated reference maps (Section 3.2).
Second, to develop an accuracy-balanced random forest
model, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of class ratios
(the optimal ratio of training samples) (Section 3.3). We
used layerstacks with diﬀerent sets of inputs (seasonal
features, nighttime light, and slope), statistically tested

(Section 3.4). Thirdly, we validated with independent
samples the applicability of the best model for other years
with subsampled replicates (Section 3.5). Finally, we
applied the RF model to map annual landslide occurrence
explicitly from 1998 to 2017, demonstrating how these
maps can be used to identify spatiotemporal patterns of
landslide activities (Section 3.6).

surface reﬂectance data at a 30m spatial resolution with
systematic terrain correction and atmospheric correction,
and are provided with per-pixel quality information,
including a cloud mask produced with the CFMask
algorithm (Foga et al. 2017). We used the quality band to
remove middle- and high-conﬁdence cloud pixels. Areas
of gaps caused by the scan line corrector failure (known
as SLC-oﬀ) of Landsat-7 ETM+ were not processed for
surface reﬂectance (Markham et al. 2004). This step
allowed us to avoid value anomalies but increased data
loss, which was pronounced along the edge of the scenes,
covering the middle part of our study area. We utilized the
blue, green, red, near infrared, ﬁrst and second shortwave
infrared bands. NDVI and NDWI were ﬁrst calculated for
each single-date image (see formulas in Table 1). Then,
the values of the bands and the indices were calculated
as seasonal means in winter (December of the previous
year to February), spring (March to May), and summer
(June to August). This fusion step increased cloud-free
observations (Fig. S1, Appendix A). We excluded images
from September to November (Autumn), considering
the ﬂuctuation of typhoon perturbation and short-term
vegetation recovery.

3.1.2. Aster GDEM data

The ASTER GDEM (obtained from https://gdex.
cr.usgs.gov/) is a product of NASA and METI and was
generated from ASTER imagery with a resolution of 30m.
The elevation is assumed to be static in this study and
we used the only single-time product of GDEM that is
produced from stereo-pairs acquired from 2000 to 2011 to
represent the general topography. Elevation information
was used to derive the slope variable.

3.1.3. Nighttime light data

Nighttime light datasets include cloud-free DMSP
data (1998-2013) and VIIRS data (2014-2017) and
were downloaded from https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/
eog/. The DMSP annual composite data contain average
radiance values of cloud-free coverages (Fig. S1, Appendix
A), reﬂecting the persistent lights from cities, villages,
and roads, with a spatial resolution of about 900m, and
a temporal coverage of 1992 to 2013 (Elvidge et al.
2017;
Starting in 2013, VIIRS
data is available with a ﬁner spatial resolution of 450m
approximately. As this newer data are only available
in monthly composites (in contrast to the DMSP data
which were aggregated to annual data), we used March
data, with less cloud cover (Fig. S1, Appendix A) and
the least number of Taiwanese holidays reducing in and
out-migration, thus ensuring relatively stable lighting.
To make VIIRS data comparable with DMSP data, we

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.03.013

adopted a two-step procedure to spectrally stretch VIIRS
data by the products in the overlapping year of 2013 for
the study area. First, we removed outliers by forcing
values greater than 40 and lower than 0.2 to 40 and 0.2,
respectively. Second, we correlated the two datasets using
a logarithmic transformation, producing a correlation
coeﬃcient of 0.94. We thus used a linear-log regression
to stretch outlier-removed VIIRS data from 2014 to 2017
as follows:

V (cid:48) = 26.139 × log10(V ) + 23.179

where V (cid:48) is the stretched VIIRS data, 26.139 is the
slope, V is the outlier-removed VIIRS data, and 23.179 is
the intercept.

3.2. Training and validation data collection

To produce training and validation datasets, we used
reference landslide maps (2005-2016) from the Taiwan
Council of Agriculture (data available from https://
www.tgos.tw, also presented in Fig. S3, Appendix A).
The twelve annual
landslide maps covering the whole
area of Taiwan were created with semi-automatic image
classiﬁcation approach (multispectral Formosat-2 satellite
images at 2m resolution were taken between January
and July). Non-vegetated areas that are not landslides
were manually corrected, including human land use, river
sediments, and displaced materials (debris/rock) overlying

landslide objects was 1,000 m2. These reference maps were
validated by visual interpretation of national aerial photos
with 98% of overall accuracy (Lin et al. 2013).

Training and validation sample sets were produced
for ‘landslide’ and ‘non-landslide’ classes. We created
sample points with an account for spatial autocorrelation,
as spatial autocorrelation of the sample may reduce the
representativeness of sampling (Millard and Richardson
2015). We measured spatial autocorrelation with Moran’s
I (Ord 2004) and found that the spatial autocorrelation
rapidly decreased (from 0.9 to 0.7) between 0-3 pixels.
Thus, we sampled points by keeping the minimum distance
of 100m (> 3 pixels). Using this distance limit, the
ﬁrst sets of training and validation data were produced
independently without overlap (validation points at the
distance of 0-100 m from training sample were removed).
The training set included 60,000 points for each of training
years (2005, 2010, and 2015), and validation set included
around 110,000 points for each of test years (2005-2016)
(Table 2). The two sets were used for sub-sampling
(drawing a small number of points) when classiﬁcation and
accuracy tests were iteratively implemented.

3.3. Sensitivity analysis

We noticed that the class distribution was unbalanced,
thus potentially introducing a bias of classiﬁcation
with overestimation of the dominant (non-landslide) and

underestimation of the rare class (landslide) (Dalponte
et al. 2013). To evaluate the impact of unbalanced class
distribution on the accuracy, we applied a sensitivity
analysis approach proposed by Stumpf and Kerle 2011
that tests diﬀerent class ratios (β) to deﬁne the optimal
ratio of training samples to ﬁnd an optimal balance
between user’s (overestimation) accuracy and producer’s
(underestimation) accuracy. For the analysis of class
ratio optimization and the ﬁnal classiﬁcation and accuracy
assessment, a 50-fold-iterative procedure was performed
for each model. For each iteration, we adjusted the Stumpf
and Kerle approach, by using a consistent total sample size
to avoid a confounding sample size eﬀect. In this way, 2000
training points for 2005, 2010, and 2015 were randomly
drawn from the large training set, and 6000 validation
points for each of the test years from the validation set
were subsampled as test set (Fig. 2). The parameter βi
refers to the ratio of landslide and non-landslide samples
in the training set and was changed iteratively to approach
an optimal value βn balancing producer’s and user’s
accuracies. The procedure started from an equal class
distribution (βi = 1), which deﬁnes the sample size for
landslide (2000/(1+βi)) and non-landslide (2000×βi/(1+
βi)), and in each step βi was increased by 0.1 until
reaching a non-landslide-ﬁvefold class distribution (βi =
5). To help the classiﬁer to better learn the complexity of
non-landslide activities, we ensured a minimum number of
points (N=100) for six non-landslide land covers (building,
road, agriculture, forest, non-landslide barren land, and
water). In each iteration, 100 points were ﬁrst allocated
to every land cover class and then the remaining points
were proportionally allocated.

3.4. Classiﬁcation methods

To map landslides, we used Random Forest (RF), a
non-parametric machine learning classiﬁer that has proven
to accurately diﬀerentiate spectrally complex classes
(Belgiu and Dr˘agut¸ 2016). A RF classiﬁer is an ensemble
classiﬁer that grows multiple decision trees and are trained
using bagging, thereby letting the trees determine the

5

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.03.013

probability of the class membership. RF performs multiple
criteria classiﬁcation, being at the same time fast and
insensitive to overﬁtting (Breiman 2001). We utilized a
version of RF implemented in the R statistical software
with the randomForest package (Liaw and Wiener 2002).
RFs were trained with a combined training data subset
from 2005, 2010, and 2015, which was class-ratio-adjusted.
For parameterizing the RF classiﬁer, based on out-of-bag
accuracy, we used 500 trees and took the square root
of the number of
layers as a split criterion at each
node. We ran two classiﬁcation scenarios (Table 3) to
test the two hypotheses that multi-seasonal imagery (H1)
and nighttime light (H2) results in higher classiﬁcation
accuracy.
To test H1, we classiﬁed a layerstack
including bands and indices from three seasons (winter,
spring and summer) and compared with the classiﬁcation
outcomes when only one single season was used. To
test H2, we classiﬁed a layerstack with and without the
additional
inclusion of nighttime light data. We ﬁrst
separately estimated the optimal class ratio (β) for the
H1 and H2 models by 50 iterations for each model with
randomly subsampled training and validation datasets
(with replacement). Based on their optimal numbers,
we assessed the accuracies and statistically compared
producer’s and user’s accuracies of the models for H1 and
H2 using t-test at alpha=0.001.

3.5. Accuracy assessment

To test whether the ﬁnal model trained with the
βn-adjusted sample from the three years (2005, 2010
and 2015) is robust and applicable to other years, we
used validation samples from twelve years (2005-2016) to
evaluate annual accuracies. Although a random forest
classiﬁer calculates out-of-bag cross-validation accuracy,
we relied on independent validation datasets for the ﬁnal
accuracy assessment. We subsampled 6,000 points for each
of the tested years. Since the equal allocation of validation
samples for unbalanced classes is not appropriate for
area estimation and proportional allocation may result
in imprecise estimates of user’s accuracy for the rare
class (a landslide in our case), we adopted an alternative
sample allocation approach proposed by Olofsson et al.
2014. We examined the standard errors of the estimated
user’s accuracy and the estimated area and allocated 500
points for a landslide, and the remaining 5500 points were
allocated to the non-landslide class.

These points were evaluated as one of four validation
categories: true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false
negative (FN), false positive (FP). TPs represent spatially
and temporally correct landslide points, TNs are correct
non-landslide points, FNs are reference landslide points

Table 3: Variables used for hypothesis 1 and 2.

missing in the detection and FPs are points identiﬁed as
landslide but are not present in the reference map. Based
on these categories, we calculated overall accuracy ((TP
+ TN / (TP + TN + FP + FN)), user’s accuracy (TP /
(TP + FP)), and producer’s accuracy (TP / (TP + FN)).
The user’s accuracy represents the model performance in
reducing landslide overestimation and producer’s accuracy
refers to the ability to minimize landslide underestimation.
We implemented 100 subsampled replications to estimate
the mean and standard deviation for the overall accuracy,
user’s accuracy and producer’s accuracy for each test year.

Based on the best RF model (Section 3.4) we derived
the annual landslide / non-landslide maps from 1998 to
2017. To characterize the diﬀerent types of long-term risk
of landslides, we calculated the frequency, ﬁrst occurrence,
persistence and reoccurrence landslide metrics from the
derived maps. First occurrence is the year the landslide
was ﬁrst observed from 1998 to 2017. Persistence expresses
the longest number of consecutive years of
landslide
occurrence at a location. The frequency metric is a
landslide rate (occurrences from 1998 to 2017 divided by
the number of years). The reoccurrence metric addresses
the number of landslide intervals. An interval ended if
a pixel experienced revegetation (becoming non-landslide)
in a year after landslide occurrence.

4. Results

imagery

We present our results in four parts: the sensitivity
analysis (Section 4.1) and model comparison (Section 4.2),
which suggested that multi-seasonal
and
nighttime light resulted in statistically signiﬁcantly more
accurate classiﬁcation accuracies
(p<0.001). When
those features were used, the validation of the ﬁnal
model showed that user’s and producer’s accuracies
over test years ranged from 73% to 86% (Section 4.3).
In last Section 4.4, the application results of detecting
spatiotemporal patterns with the developed model were
obtained.

4.1. Sensitivity analysis

For all six models, we observed a strong over-estimation
of landslide areas if samples of the two classes were equally
sized (β = 1) (Fig. 3). The over-estimation of landslide
areas was even more pronounced if single-season models
were utilized. By iteratively increasing βi the balance
of user’s and producer’s accuracies was found to vary

the optimal class ratio was model-dependent, we used the
optimal ratio for each model independently for further
model comparisons.

4.2. Eﬀects of using nighttime lights and multi-seasonal

imagery

(p<0.001)

Results of the t-test for scenario (H1) (Table 4) show
that the multi-season model that includes the variables
from all three seasons achieved balanced user’s and
producer’s accuracies of 78%, and performed statistically
signiﬁcantly more accurate
compared to
single-season models for winter,
spring and summer.
Among the single-season models, summer and spring
yielded statistically more accurate classiﬁcation accuracies
(user’s and producer’s accuracies range of 74-76%) than
the winter model, with user’s and producer’s accuracy
around 72%. For scenario (H2) (Table 5), combined
nighttime light data and multi-seasonal satellite imagery
resulted in a statistically more accurate classiﬁcation
accuracy (balanced user’s accuracy and producer’s
accuracy of 81%), compared to classiﬁed multi-seasonal

86%,
implying that the model can be applied also for
other years. We observed that user’s accuracy in years
2014 to 2016 were higher (average of 84%) than previous
years (average of 80%) (Table 6),
indicating that the
higher resolution of nighttime light data helps to reduce
over-prediction.

southern parts of the central mountain range. A subset
(Fig. 4A) illustrates how landslides were better depicted
when landslide geometry was more compact. Although
the compact and massive landslides were successfully
detected, false positives were predominantly distributed
along the edge of the small landslides, where mixed pixels
are common.
Inset (Fig. 4B) highlights the classiﬁed
occurrence of a disastrous deep-seated landslide induced
by extreme rainfall on 8 August 2010 – the “Shiaolin
landslide” that destroyed a village, causing 491 fatalities.
Deep-seated landslides are usually larger than shallow
landslides. Fig. 4C presents a large-scale landslide at the
vicinity of Fig. 4B.

We identiﬁed the composition of existing landslides,
which we classiﬁed into old ones, new ones, and also
revegetated areas (Fig. 5). After the dramatic Chi-Chi
earthquake in late 1999, the overall
landslide area in
2000 was only 6% higher compared to that prior to the
earthquake. However, the estimate of new landslide areas
indicated a signiﬁcant increase by 34% compared to the
previous year, which shows how extreme this event was.

4.4. Characterizing spatiotemporal patterns of landslide

activities

We applied the most accurate model (incorporating
variables of nighttime light, slope, and multiple seasonal
bands, NDVI, and NDWI) for annual mapping landslides
from 1998 to 2017 across Taiwan. The results showed that
landslide areas varied from 1998 to 2017 across Taiwan
(Fig. 5) with an increase in landslide occurrence in the
south of Taiwan (Fig. 6).

The landslides in the northern regions were mostly
triggered before 2002 and after the Chi-Chi earthquake
in 1999 (Fig. 6), while landslides in the southern regions
predominantly occurred from 2009, corresponding to the
timing of typhoon Morakot. The temporal patterns of
landslide activities are diﬀerent between a northern site
(Fig. 6A) and a southern site (Fig. 6B),
in terms of
frequency, persistence, and reoccurrence.

4.3. Transferability of the model over time

5. Discussion

When applying the best model, including variables of
nighttime light, slope, and multiple seasonal bands, NDVI,
and NDWI, our accuracy assessment results showed that
the overall accuracies in other years ranged from 96% to
97% (Table 6). The user’s accuracies varied between 74
and 85% and producer’s accuracies were between 73 and

We developed an approach using freely available
Landsat multi-seasonal imagery and nighttime light data
to reconstruct long-term dynamics of landslides in Taiwan.

reached an overall accuracy of 97%, and a balanced user’s
and producer’s accuracies of 81%. When applying the
developed RF model
for other years without training
samples for the respective years, we also achieved high
overall, user’s, and producer’s accuracies (96-97%, 74-85%,
and 73-86%). The accuracies achieved are more balanced
compared to other recent studies of large-scale landslide
detection in Asia, with user’s and producer’s accuracy at
58% and 87% based on a multi-sensor approach (resolution
at 5m-30m) for long-term landslide mapping (Behling et al.
2016), and at 32% and 63% based on single-temporal
Landsat imagery (Yu and Chen 2017). Our approach is
comparable in accuracy to a study on landslide detection
based on object-based classiﬁcation of optical
imagery
and DEM at higher resolution (2-10m) which also reaches
balanced accuracies between 73% and 87% (Stumpf and
Kerle 2011).

We found nighttime light imagery helpful for increasing
classiﬁcation accuracy of
landslides in anthropogenic
areas. Despite its relative coarse resolution, luminosity
from built-up areas and road lights allows the models
to account for the human activities not aﬀected by
landslides and thus to separate them from landslide
aﬀected areas. Earlier studies have found the usefulness of
nighttime light imagery to assess the changes in population
density, various economic activities and technological
shifts (Bennett and Smith 2017; Rybnikova and Portnov
2017). To our knowledge, the current study is the ﬁrst to
test the suitability of employing nighttime light imagery
to study landslides. Our results suggest that the use of
nighttime light data helps in disentangling the complex
interrelationship between spectral signatures of natural
and human-managed land cover classes, and therefore is
of usefulness in mapping impacts of hazards.

We

classiﬁcation of

The use of machine-learning random forest is powerful
in separating multi-dimensional seasonal signals.
For
instance, built-up areas have stable reﬂectance across

winter, spring and summer, while landslides may have
ﬂuctuating reﬂectance values across the year due to
the contribution from the varying vegetation signals
associated with regrowth. Several studies have proven
the utility of multi-seasonal imagery and multiple criteria
classiﬁers to accurately classify various land-cover types
and land use (Oetter et al. 2001; Guerschman et al. 2003;
Bleyhl et al. 2017; Gao et al. 2015; Gr˘adinaru et al. 2017).
Our study highlights the power of multi-seasonal imagery
for accurately mapping landslides.

landslides

Landslides are widespread throughout the world but
tend to have been mapped in details and only at a
very localized scale or for a short duration (Van Westen
et al. 2006). The current global database of landslides
records only fatal
(Petley 2012), and is
not updated with past landslides and whether areas
of landslides were recovered or rehabilitated. Taiwan
has a very dynamic landslide environment, driven by
high precipitation events, frequent earthquakes, and fast
vegetation regrowth (Chang et al. 2007). We found an
inter-annual ﬂuctuation of the total potential landslide
area between 478 to 1130 km2 in Taiwan without a
consistent increase or decrease between 1998 and 2017.
This absence of a trend is in contrast to the continuing
upward trend of globally recorded landslides (Petley 2012).
We observed that landslide areas could largely recover
within a year (Fig. 5), and that landslide areas decreased
by 35% from 2011 to 2012 and by 32% from 2013 to 2014.
In contrast, the highest growth rate from 2008 to 2009
(65%), is explained by the tropical cyclone Morakot that
hit Taiwan in August 2009, conﬁrming the general trend
observed by Petley 2010 that the major driver of landslides
in East Asia is tropical cyclones.

There were some limitations in our study, such as
a necessity to fuse multi-sensor imagery. Multi-sensor
images may have diﬀerent spatial, spectral, temporal
and radiometric resolutions (Pohl and Van Genderen
1998) and for instance an intercalibration of DMSP and
VIIRS nighttime light data is required. To mitigate the
impacts of application of inconsistent data, we trained
our model by selecting training years covering diﬀerent
sensors’ span. Additionally, nighttime light data have a
relatively coarse resolution (at best 500m) which diﬀered
from the 30-m Landsat imagery we utilized in our
study. Nevertheless, a combination of multi-sensor data
allows increasing the time span of observations, and
facilitates highlighting speciﬁc phenomena, which may not
be possible to detect with a single remote sensing product
(e.g., optical imagery).

Our landslide maps did not fully cover our study
area, because of data availability of optical imagery in
this cloud-prone region. Therefore, we missed detection
of landslides in Taiwan for 13% and 11% of the total
area in 1998 and 2013, respectively, as there were less
accessible images (before Landsat-7 launched in 1999 and
right after Landsat-5 stopped collecting data in 2013).
Where image availability and cloud-contamination is an

10

issue, the number of observations can be complemented
with additional use of radar (e.g., Sentinel-1 since 2013)
imagery, as well as fusion using images from MODIS
and Landsat (Zhu et al. 2016). We did not test the
performance of higher resolution remotely sensed products
that are also freely available, such as from the Sentinel-2
MSI time-series imagery. Sentinel-2 MSI imagery has high
potential to enhance classiﬁcation of landslides with higher
spatial accuracy, but limited historical coverage. What
our study showed is that, even with radiometrically coarse
DMSP nighttime light data and optical Landsat imagery,
it is possible to reconstruct historical landslides as early as
the early 1990s accurately.

Despite some limitations, we propose the idea of using
cost-eﬀective data and methods to provide knowledge of
historical landslide inventories, reﬂecting landslide ﬁrst
occurrence, persistence, as well as identify reoccurring
landslide activities. Compared to areas showing only
recent landslides, the areas of persistent landslides are
more predictable and land-use plans around these regions
can be formulated in advance. The reoccurrence rate
is related to the depths of the sliding plane, which
is useful for identifying remediation strategies. These
annual landslide maps also provide a basis for studies on
drivers of landscape changes and to help develop policy
interventions.

6. Conclusions

Here we explored the eﬀectiveness of nighttime light
and multi-seasonal imagery to provide improved landslide
image classiﬁcation and for the derivation of long-term
landslide maps in Taiwan from 1998 to 2017. Our ﬁndings
conﬁrmed that nighttime light and multi-seasonal optical
imagery could signiﬁcantly improve landslide mapping
accuracies. This approach proved to be robust and
transferable to historical mapping of landslides over a
long period (20 years). We demonstrate the usefulness
of
long-term landslide maps that allow characterizing
spatio-temporal patterns of landslide characteristics such
as ﬁrst time of occurrence, persistence and reoccurrence
rate. Notably, during the period 1998 to 2017 the patterns
of high landslide occurrence shifted from the north to the
south of Taiwan. Our ﬁndings of the utility of nighttime
light imagery and optical multi-seasonal imagery to map
retrospective landslides can likely be replicated elsewhere,
particularly because of the growing archives of
freely
available optical Landsat-like multi-seasonal imagery and
reﬁned VIIRS nighttime light data.

Detecting and monitoring long-term landslides in urbanized areas with nighttime light data and multi-seasonal Landsat imagery across Taiwan from 1998 to 2017 Tzu-Hsin Karen Chen, Alexander V. Prishchepov, Rasmus Fensholt, Clive E. Sabel  Supplementary data  Fig. S1. The observation density of annual variables, (A) Landsat optical imagery (years 1998-2017) and (B) nighttime light imagery (DMSP for 1998-2013 and VIIRS for 2014-2017). The Landsat image availability was assessed for winter, spring, and summer. The DMSP data were annual composites and VIIRS were March composites (avoiding summer).  16

   Fig. S2. The importance of a variable was measured as the mean decrease in the producer’s accuracy of the landslide class, when the variable in question is excluded. Standardized (Std.) importance is adjusted by standard errors. Variables from ancillary data, nighttime light (blue) and slope (yellow), are highlighted.           17
