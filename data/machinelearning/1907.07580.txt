Abstract—Inspired from recent

insights into the common
ground of machine learning, optimization and decision-making,
this paper proposes an easy-to-implement, but effective procedure
to enhance both the quality of renewable energy forecasts and
the competitive edge of renewable energy producers in electricity
markets with a dual-price settlement of imbalances. The quality
and economic gains brought by the proposed procedure essen-
tially stem from the utilization of valuable predictors (also known
as features) in a data-driven newsvendor model that renders a
computationally inexpensive linear program. We illustrate the
proposed procedure and numerically assess its beneﬁts on a
realistic case study that considers the aggregate wind power
production in the Danish DK1 bidding zone as the variable
to be predicted and traded. Within this context, our procedure
leverages, among others, spatial information in the form of wind
power forecasts issued by transmission system operators (TSO)
in surrounding bidding zones and publicly available in online
platforms. We show that our method is able to improve the
quality of the wind power forecast issued by the Danish TSO
by several percentage points (when measured in terms of the
mean absolute or the root mean square error) and to signiﬁcantly
reduce the balancing costs incurred by the wind power producer.

I. INTRODUCTION

Thrilling yet challenging times lie ahead for the electrical
power industry. The development of microgrids, the growing
contribution of weather-driven renewable energy sources, the
higher involvement of power consumers, and the increasing
exchange of electricity among neighbouring regions are de-
manding profound changes in the power sector. These changes
are expected to turn power systems into complex and critical
cyber-physical systems, where data will be generated and
made accessible in abundance and where data will play an
increasingly important role for decision-making.

In Europe, for example, the efforts invested by the EU
member countries in setting up a single electricity market
have been accompanied with the development of the so-called
ENTSO-e Transparency Platform [1], a web database where
data on electricity generation, transmission and consumption
in the pan-European market is gradually collected, published,
and made publicly available for download. In fact, the research
here described constitutes an example of how the information
gathered in this platform can be used to generate extra value
in two important tasks that are performed daily in electricity
markets, namely, renewable energy forecasting and trading.
More speciﬁcally, we focus on the aggregate onshore wind
power production of the DK1 bidding zone of the European
market and show that the forecast that is issued by the Danish
TSO everyday can be noticeably and easily improved by lever-
aging the information contained in that platform, in particular,
the forecasts of wind power production in neighbouring areas
issued by their respective TSOs. Furthermore, we also show
that this very same information can be used to increase the
proﬁtability of wind power production in electricity markets
with a dual-price ﬁnancial settlement for imbalances.

To achieve these goals, we exploit recent

insights into
the close bonds that connect the ﬁelds of machine learning,
optimization and decision-making. For some years now, re-
searchers from these ﬁelds have been developing methods that
leverage data not to make better predictions, but to make better
decisions, on the grounds that the former does not always
necessarily imply the latter. In this line, we mention the works
[2]–[5]. From among them, our work builds on the data-driven
model for the newsvendor problem developed in [5], because

 
 
 
 
 
 
of its simplicity and because it neatly ﬁts with the setup of
our problem. As explained later, however, our problem exhibits
some peculiarities that make it especially challenging.

On a different front, the technical literature on wind power
forecasting and trading is tremendously vast. Mentioning all
the many relevant references on both topics in this paper would
be, therefore, an infeasible and purposeless task. We refer,
instead, to monographs [6], [7], which offer a comprehensive
treatment of both topics, and highlight next those works that,
we believe, are most closely related to ours. In the realm
of wind power prediction, such works would be those that
either seek to model the spatial correlations among wind sites
(see, e.g., [8]–[11]) or to adaptively combine alternative wind
power forecasts for the same site so as to produce a better
one (see, for example, [12]–[14]). In our case, however, we
do not aim at developing a better forecasting model. What
we propose, instead, is a general mathematical framework to
improve the forecasts delivered by any existing method by
leveraging available power system data. To do so, we use
a straightforward procedure that exploits extra information,
for example, information on spatially correlated phenomena.
On the other hand, there also exists a wealth of methods to
determine the optimal energy bid that a wind power producer
should place in a day-ahead electricity market (see, for in-
stance, [15]–[21]). To this end, all these methods make explicit
use of stochastic models for the wind power production and/or
market prices, for example, in the form of scenario forecasts
or predictive densities. Additionally, other strategies have been
also proposed to cope with the inherent uncertainty in wind
power production such as the purchase of power reserves [22]
or by means of a combined portfolio of wind and hydro power
generation [23]. What distinguishes our work from these others
is that we directly derive a wind power day-ahead bid from
available point forecasts and other relevant data, thus avoiding
the need to generate scenarios or probabilistic forecasts for
electricity prices and wind power production.

We particularly mention [24] and the recently published
paper [25] as the works that are probably closest to ours. In
[24], a reinforcement learning algorithm is built to compute
and follow the nominal level of the proﬁt-maximizing quantile
forecast of wind power that should be bid into the day-
ahead market. While their algorithm is designed to learn and
track the expected marginal opportunity costs directly from
market data, they assume that a good estimate of the wind
power predictive density is available (as in the other references
mentioned above). Our approach, on the contrary, is freed from
this classical assumption. In [25], the authors propose two
data-driven approaches to reduce the imbalance costs incurred
by renewable energy producers. In their ﬁrst approach, they
formulate a meta-optimization problem whereby the hyper-
parameters of all
the forecasting models involved in the
decision-making process are tuned to minimize the imbalance
costs. In their second approach, they directly train an artiﬁcial
neural network to that very same end. In contrast with our
proposal, which boils down to a linear programming problem,
the complexity of theirs is such that they need to resort to
heuristic optimization algorithms. Furthermore, our way to
produce market bids is somewhat different: We do not search

2

for a bidding model that overrides the need for forecasts
(understood in a classical statistical sense), but collect those
forecasts, among other features, and combine them to produce
proﬁt-maximizing bids.

The contributions of our paper are, therefore, the following.
1) We propose a general data-driven optimization framework
to improve a forecast of renewable power production by
a) tailoring the optimization problem by which the fore-
cast is improved to the speciﬁc use for which the
forecast is intended, and

b) leveraging extra information on potentially related phe-
nomena, such as the forecasts of the renewable power
production in adjacent regions.

The proposed framework is based on a data-driven model
for the newsvendor problem and reduces to a computa-
tionally efﬁcient and easy-to-implement linear program.
2) We focus on two particular instances of the general
framework proposed in point 1) above. The ﬁrst one seeks
to improve the estimate of the median of the renewable
energy production, while the second aims to increase the
proﬁtability of renewable power production in electricity
markets with a dual-price settlement for imbalances.
3) We illustrate the beneﬁts of our approach on a realistic
case study that considers the aggregate onshore wind
power production of the DK1 bidding area of the Eu-
ropean market. Furthermore, this case study serves us to
argue that the accuracy of the renewable energy forecasts
issued by TSOs could be signiﬁcantly improved, if they
were willing to share those forecasts among them.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
states the problem and introduces the data-driven newsvendor
model we propose to solve it, while Section III elaborates
on its practical implementation. Numerical results from the
application of our approach to real data are discussed in
Section IV. Finally, conclusions are duly drawn in Section V.

II. DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH

Consider an electricity market for short-term energy trans-
actions that consists of a day-ahead market and a dual-price
balancing market. In the former, energy offers and bids are
typically to be submitted between 12 and 36 hours in advance
of the actual delivery of electricity. In the latter, deviations of
market participants with respect to their day-ahead dispatch
are ﬁnancially settled at a price that depends on the sign of
the total system imbalance [7, Ch. 7].

In such a context, the market revenue ρ of a renewable
energy producer in a dual-price balancing market is given by

ρ = λDE −

ψ−(ED − E)+ + ψ+(E − ED)+

(1)

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

where λD, ED, ψ−, ψ+, and E represent the day-ahead mar-
ket price, the day-ahead renewable energy bid, the marginal
opportunity costs for under- and overproduction, and the even-
tual renewable energy production, respectively. In (1), the ﬁrst
term accounts for the incomes the renewable power producer
would obtain from partaking in the day-ahead market if she
had perfect information on her eventual production, while the
second is the opportunity cost the producer incurs in deviating

from the day-ahead bid ED. Logically, parameters ψ−, ψ+,
and E are uncertain to the renewable energy producer at the
moment of offering in the day-ahead market. Besides, the term
λDE is out of the power producer’s control. As a result, the
optimal offer ED that a (price-taker) risk-neutral renewable
energy producer should place in the day-ahead market is given
as the solution to the following linear programming problem,
whereby the renewable energy producer seeks to minimize the
expected opportunity cost for under- and overproduction:

min
ED ∈[0,E]

E

ψ−(ED − E)+ + ψ+(E − ED)+

(2)

where (x)+ := max(x, 0).

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

In problem (2), the expectation is taken over the stochastic
input parameters E, ψ− and ψ+. Actually, the way the solution
to problem (2) is addressed depends on the information we
have about these parameters. Furthermore, this problem must
be (independently) solved for every trading period comprising
the day-ahead market horizon (typically the 24 hours of a day).
For simplicity, though, we have dropped the time index from
the problem formulation. We will introduce that index in a
later stage of our exposition.

The marginal opportunity costs for under- and overproduc-

tion, i.e., ψ− and ψ+, are deﬁned as:

ψ− = λ− − λD
ψ+ = λD − λ+

(3)

(4)

where, in turn, the prices for under- and overproduction, i.e.,
λ− and λ+ are given by:

λ− =

λ+ =

(

(

λB if λB ≥ λD
λD if λB < λD

λD if λB ≥ λD
λB if λB < λD

(5)

(6)

In (5) and (6), λD and λB denote the day-ahead and the
balancing market prices, in that order.

Therefore, according to the rules (3)–(6) of a dual-price im-
balance settlement, the overproduction of a renewable energy
producer is always rewarded at a price lower than or equal
to the day-ahead market price, while their underproduction is
always penalized at a price higher than or equal to the day-
ahead market price. This settlement is, at least, used in some
European countries such as Spain and Denmark [26].

Problem (2) takes the form of the classical newsvendor
problem [27], for which an analytical solution exists. Indeed,
the optimal solution to this problem (that is, the optimal bid
ED∗), is given by:

ED∗ = F −1
E

¯ψ+
¯ψ+ + ¯ψ−

(7)

(cid:18)
where FE is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the
renewable energy production corresponding to the time period
of the market horizon for which the day-ahead bid must be
submitted, and the overbar character denotes the expected
value of the random variable underneath.

(cid:19)

Despite its apparent simplicity, the application of formula
(7) is quite demanding, as it requires models to produce a

3

probabilistic forecast of E (i.e., an estimate of its cdf) and
point forecasts of ψ− and ψ+. In the ﬁrst approach proposed in
[25], for example, those models are tuned (by way of what they
call a meta-optimization problem) to produce a good estimate
of (7). Our goal, though, is to sidestep the need for those
models and directly use available data instead. This motivates
our data-driven approach, which we gradually build next.

Suppose that the renewable energy producer is to place a
bid in the day-ahead market and that measurements of her
renewable energy production at past periods are available. We
can then directly use the empirical cdf of these data, namely,
FE, in lieu of FE in (7), which thus becomes

where the inﬁmum is required due to the discrete nature of
ED in (8) and ED∗ in (7) are generally different,

and therefore,

From the equivalence between (8) and (9), we can infer that if
we (artiﬁcially) set ¯ψ− = ¯ψ+ = 1 in (9), we get an estimate
of the median of the renewable energy production. We will
leverage this fact later on to develop a straightforward method
to enhance the quality of renewable energy forecasts.

Problem (9), however, is likely to deliver poor bids

ED,
because it overlooks the fact that, at the moment of bidding,
the renewable power producer may have information on a
vector x of p features with some predictive power on her
ED, we
future production. Accordingly, to get a better bid
need to reformulate the SAA problem (9) to account for
and take advantage of that information. For this purpose,
we consider the enriched dataset {(Et, xt), ∀t ∈ T }, where
xt is the p-dimensional realization of features x observed at
time t. These features may include measures of potentially
explanatory variables available at time period t or forecasts
of these variables issued for that time period. We then follow
the approach proposed in [5] and consider the following linear
decision rule

Nonetheless, problem (11)–(12) still requires further elabo-
ration to become a fully data-driven model. Indeed, while in
the technical literature on the data-driven newsvendor problem
(see, for instance, [5] and [28]), the marginal opportunity

costs ¯ψ− and ¯ψ+ are assumed to be known with certainty,
in our case, these costs are unknown to the renewable energy
producer at the moment of bidding into the day-ahead market.
Consequently, problem (11)–(12) still needs the support of a
forecasting model that provides it with an estimate of ¯ψ−
and ¯ψ+. To circumvent this hurdle, we propose to work with
t , ψ+
,
the even more enriched dataset
where the pair (ψ−
t ) represents the marginal costs of
(cid:9)
under- and overproduction that were observed at time t, and
solve instead the following optimization problem:

where we have replaced ¯ψ− and ¯ψ+ with ψ−

respectively. Model (13)–(14) is, in effect, fully data-driven.
Finally, to recast problem (13)–(14) as a linear program,
we introduce the auxiliary variables ot and ut to equivalently

(19)

Next, we explain how we use the linear program (15)–(19) to
improve the tasks of renewable energy forecasting and trading.

A. Renewable Energy Forecasting

Problem (15)–(19) provides us with a simple, but effective
procedure to enhance the quality of a given renewable energy
forecast by exploiting auxiliary information. For this purpose,
t = ψ+
ﬁrst we need to set ψ−
t = 1, ∀t ∈ T , in (15)–(19). This
results in the following linear programming problem:

min

(20)

(21)

(23)

(24)

j=1 q∗jxj

where the coefﬁcients qj of the linear decision rule are now
optimized to learn the median of the random renewable energy
p
t , with q∗j being the
production. In other words,
optimal value of qj obtained from (20)–(24), is expected to
P
be a good estimate of the median of the renewable energy
production at time t. This can be also inferred from the fact
that model (20)–(24) minimizes the average absolute value
of the renewable power deviations over the training sample,
subject to the positiveness and capacity constraints (23).

Finally, we just have to include the renewable energy
forecast we desire to improve as one of the regressors or
features xj in the linear decision rule. The remaining features
will then correspond to that extra information we want to take
advantage of to enhance the quality of the renewable energy
forecast. This extra information may be of a very different
nature. For example, some of the features could correspond
to categorical variables (hour of the day, day of the week ...)
and others could be forecasts of potentially related stochastic
variables. As a matter of fact, several features in vector x
could represent forecasts on the renewable energy production
of interest, but issued by different entities. The only condition
for a piece of information to be treated as a feature is that it
must be available at the time when the enhanced renewable
energy forecast is to be generated.

In the particular application we present later on, we seek
to improve the onshore wind power production forecast of the
DK1 area of the pan-European electricity market that is issued
every day by the Danish TSO. This benchmark is referred
to as BM throughout the rest of the paper. To this end, we
use, as additional features, the forecasts of the wind power
production in neighbouring regions that are produced by the
respective TSOs in charge of those regions. We also introduce
the constant feature x1 = 1 to correct for possible offsets.
The onshore DK1-wind power forecast issued by the Danish
TSO (that is, model BM) is produced by the tool known as
WindFor [29], a state-of-the-art software for forecasting wind
power production at different scales that leverages numerical
weather predictions (wind speed and direction), statistics and
artiﬁcial intelligence.

B. Renewable Energy Trading

t , ψ+

In principle, model (15)–(19) could be directly used for
renewable energy trading without further ado. To this aim, we
would just need to solve this problem for the enriched dataset
(Et, ψ−
and thus, obtain the optimal coef-
ﬁcient vector q∗ deﬁning the linear decision rule (this is what
(cid:8)
we call model training). Then, the bid ED
to be submitted by
t
the renewable energy producer to the day-ahead market for
time period t of the market horizon would be computed as

t , xt), ∀t ∈ T

(cid:9)

p

ED

t =

q∗jxj
t

(25)

j=1
X
Unfortunately, we observe in practice that the direct applica-
tion of model (15)–(19) does not produce, in general, a bid
more proﬁtable than the expected-value bid (that is, the bid
consisting in submitting the point forecast of renewable energy
production to the day-ahead market). The reason for this has to

do with the limited predictability of the marginal opportunity
costs ψ− and ψ+ (i.e., the absence of repeating patterns in the
series of these costs). In effect, as shown in Fig. 2 of [30], the
most sophisticated models for predicting ψ− and ψ+ deliver
forecasts that are completely uninformative or misleading for
lead times beyond several hours into the future. However, the
lead times required for partaking in the day-ahead market are
usually longer than 12-14 hours. This empirical observation is,
besides, supported by economic theory: the balancing market
price λB represents a marginal cost for system imbalances in
real time, which should be purely random. Consequently, the
balancing market price should behave as a noise around the
spot price λD. As a result, there is little in ψ− and ψ+ that can
be predicted for lead times longer than several hours. In this
situation, the model ﬂexibility introduced by the features in
problem (15)–(19) tends to produce overﬁtted linear decision
rules, that is, rules that capture “ﬁctitious” patterns of ψ− and
ψ+ in the historical/training dataset, but that do not repeat
themselves beyond that set.

Against this background, in lieu of model (15)–(19), we

propose to solve the following optimization problem:

min
a,u,o

1
|T |

t ut + ψ+
ψ−

t ot

t∈T
X
s. t. ut ≥ a ˆwt − Et, ∀t ∈ T
ot ≥ Et − a ˆwt, ∀t ∈ T
ut, ot ≥ 0, ∀t ∈ T

(26)

(27)

(28)
(29)

where the single feature of this model, namely, ˆw, repre-
sents the improved renewable energy forecast obtained from
model (20)–(24). What we suggest for renewable energy
trading is, therefore, a two-step procedure in which we ﬁrst
improve the renewable energy forecast by way of (20)–(24)
and then we correct such a forecast for trading by means of
the substantially less ﬂexible model (26)–(29).

As reported in [28], in newsvendor problems (similar to the
renewable energy trading problem we address here), the bulk
of the economic gains we attain from data-driven procedures
are linked to the improvement of the estimate of E that we get.
Following this rationale, we ﬁrst use (20)–(24) to enhance such
a estimate as much as possible, and then employ (26)–(29) to
account for mid-term patterns of ψ− and ψ+ (the little that we
can explain about these costs) in the market bid. Therefore,
we compute the bid to be submitted to the day-ahead market
for time period t as

ED

t = a∗ ˆwt

(30)

with a∗ being the optimal decision-rule coefﬁcient delivered
by (26)–(29).

In the following section, we elaborate on the application of

this two-step procedure on a real experiment.

III. EXPERIMENT DESIGN AND MODEL TRAINING

Next, we describe in detail the experiment conducted to
assess the performance of the data-driven models introduced
in Sections II-A and II-B for renewable energy forecasting
and trading, respectively. As previously mentioned, we focus

5

on the onshore wind power produced in the DK1 area of the
pan-European electricity market.

This section is divided in three parts. In the ﬁrst one, we
present the data gathered and the different models trained
and tested. In the second and third parts, we introduce the
metrics used to quantify the performance of those models and
elaborate on how we train them, in that order.

A. Data and Features

All the data employed in this research span from 01/08/2015
to 04/22/2019 and are fully published and freely available
for download from the website of the Danish TSO [31] and
the ENTSO-e Transparency Platform [1], which facilitates the
reproducibility of our results. These data pertain to various
features that either relate to the hour of the day and day
of the week, or to day-ahead predictions about a number
of potentially relevant variables, speciﬁcally, the total load,
scheduled generation and solar power production in DK1, and
wind power productions (onshore, offshore or both) in market
zones adjacent to DK1, namely, zone 2 of Denmark (DK2),
zone 2 of Norway (NO2), zones 3 and 4 of Sweden (SE3 and
SE4, respectively), and the bidding zone of Germany, Austria
and Luxembourg (DE-AT-LU). According to the Manual of
Procedures (MoP) of the ENTSO-e Transparency Platform
[32], these predictions should be made available in the plat-
form by the different TSOs no later than 18:00 h of day D − 1
and span the 24 hours of the following day D. However, some
TSOs are temporarily failing to faithfully comply with the
ENTSO-e’s MoP. This is the case, for example, of the Danish
TSO, which is generally uploading the day-ahead forecasts
pertaining to DK1 and DK2 several hours late (in the early
morning of day D). Besides, the day-ahead forecasts are not
accompanied with their issuance time stamp, which makes it
impossible to determine the exact time point in day D at which
those forecasts were generated. This implies that we cannot
guarantee that all the forecasts we use as features in our models
below are time-consistent, that is, that have been issued at the
same time. We explain later on, right after the presentation of
our models, how we deal with this time-consistency issue in
order to guarantee a rigorous analysis and evaluation of the
proposed approach.

On a different front, the categorical features named as “hour
of the day” and “day of the week” each comprise a group of
0/1 time series, speciﬁcally, 24 time series for the case of
“hour of the day” and seven for “day of the week.” These
series, besides, take on a value of one for all the time periods
that correspond to the label of the feature, and zero otherwise.
For example, for every hour of “Monday”, only one of the
seven series of the feature “day of the week” takes on the
value one, whereas the value of the other six is set to zero.

We build and train seven models of the type of (20)–(24).
The ﬁrst ﬁve of these models differ from one another by the
number of features they exploit. More precisely,
Forecasting Model 1 (FM1), which only includes the day-
ahead predictions of the on- and offshore wind power
production in DK1.

Forecasting Model 2 (FM2), which results from adding the
categorical variables “hour of the day” and “day of

the week”, and the day-ahead forecasts of solar power
production, scheduled generation and total load in DK1
to model FM1.

Forecasting Model 3 (FM3), which is derived from model
FM1 by adding the day-ahead forecasts of the on- and
offshore wind power production in DK2.

Forecasting Model 4 (FM4), which results from model FM3
by adding the day-ahead forecasts of the onshore wind
power production in NO2, DE-AT-LU, SE3 and SE4,
and the day-ahead forecasts of offshore wind power
production in DE-AT-LU.

Forecasting Model 5 (FM5), which includes all the previous

features.

Utopian Model 1 (UM1), which is analogous to FM4, but
uses the realized values of all the features that represent
forecasts (that is, the actual outcomes of the associated
stochastic processes), except,
logically, for the DK1-
onshore wind power forecast, which is what we seek to
improve.

Utopian Model 2 (UM2), which is also similar to model FM4,
but uses the realized values of wind power production in
SE3, SE4, NO2 and DE-AT-LU.

Models UM1 and UM2 are unrealizable in practice, as they
assume perfect information on some of the features (instead of
forecasts). However, their analysis is worthwhile to assess the
impact of the time-consistency issue we mentioned before, as
we explain next. Models FM1-FM5 can be divided into two
groups, namely:

1) Models FM1, FM2 and FM3 only use information relative
to DK1 and/or DK2, and therefore, we can ensure that
they exploit time-consistent information as they are issued
and uploaded to the ENTSO-e Transaparency Platform by
the same entity, i.e., the Danish TSO.

2) Models FM4 and FM5 also make use of information
relative to the rest of bidding zones. Hence, we cannot
guarantee that these models employ time-consistent infor-
mation. However, the performance comparison between
models FM3, FM4 and UM2 allows us to measure the
impact of this possible time inconsistency. In fact, this
impact is concluded to be negligible in Section IV-A
(around 0.25-0.30 percentage points in terms of predic-
tion performance).

Finally, model UM1 provides us with an upper bound on
how much the DK1-onshore wind power forecast issued by
the Danish TSO could be improved with our methodology
by enhancing the info on the features. More precisely, it
allows us to quantify how much we would gain in prediction
performance if we could use the actual realized values of the
features that our models exploit instead of their forecasts.

As previously mentioned, the benchmark model BM we use
for comparison and evaluation is the raw onshore DK1-wind
power forecast issued by the Danish TSO and produced by the
tool WindFor [29]. Note that this forecast (that is, the output
of WindFor) is a feature (that is, an input) common to all
the models listed above. This way, the ultimate goal of these
models is to enhance the Danish TSO’s forecast by exploiting
the info carried by the other features considered. In selecting

6

those other features that may be potentially most relevant to
enhancing the onshore DK1-wind power forecast issued by the
Danish TSO, we have limited ourselves to information that:
i) pertains to DK1 and/or neighbouring bidding zones and ii)
is published either in the ENTSO-e Transparency Platform or
on Energinet.dk’s website.

For trading the onshore DK1-wind power production in the
pan-European day-ahead market, we construct an eighth model
TM of the type of (26)–(29) that receives as input the wind
power forecast ˆwt from model FM3, which, as discussed later,
is the simplest among the proposed models for wind power
forecasting that exhibit the best overall prediction performance
over the test set. Furthermore, in Section IV-B, we compare
the market performance of the bid produced by model TM
with that of the trading strategies consisting in directly bidding
the point forecast given by models BM and FM3 into the day-
ahead market. Even though the day-ahead market of Nordpool
closes at 12:00h of D-1, that is, six hours before the deadline
established by ENTSO-e to publish the information that our
model TM uses, this is a technical issue (imposed by the
source of data we are working with) that does not invalidate
our analysis in Section IV-B, because models BM, FM3, and
TM are here compared under the same conditions.

The wind power forecasts for the market zone DE-AT-
LU are available on a 15-min time resolution, while the rest
are given in hourly resolution. Consequently, we compute
the hourly average values of the DE-AT-LU data series.
Besides, some of the series have missing values, although the
proportion of gaps in the data series relative to their length
is negligible. We ﬁll these gaps with a linear interpolation
of the values in their extremes. Last but not least, in models
FM1–FM5, UM1 and UM2, every non-categorical feature is
dynamically scaled by the maximum value of the feature that
is observed in the training dataset. The target variable, that is,
the onshore wind power production in DK1 is also scaled by
the most updated value of the wind power capacity installed
in that zone that is available in [1], which is 3669 MW. For
convenience, all the data series are labelled using Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC), which is also the time reference we
use for our experiments.

B. Performance Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the various forecasting
models stemming from (20)–(24), we use the Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), i.e.,

MAE :=

|Et − ED

where

Recall that, when forecasting, the purpose of model (20)–
(24) is to improve an existing renewable energy prediction.
In our case, this prediction is the day-ahead forecast of the
onshore wind power production in DK1 that is issued by the

Danish TSO every day. For this reason, we are especially
interested in the percentage improvement with respect to that
forecast in terms of MAE and RMSE.

On the other hand, to assess the performance of the trading
model that results from (26)–(29), we compute the average
opportunity loss (AOL) linked to the onshore wind power
production in DK1 over the test set, that is:

AOL :=

The AOL gives us an idea of the monetary value lost by the
onshore wind power production in DK1 due to its limited
predictability. Therefore, rather than in the value of AOL per
se, we are interested in the decrease in AOL that we attain by
means of model (26)–(29) relative to the AOL delivered by
submitting the Danish TSO’s forecast to the day-ahead market.
t and ψ+
t are set to one for all t the
AOL metric becomes equivalent to computing the MAE.

Finally, note that if ψ−

C. Model Training

Except for the categorical information “hour of the day” and
“day of the week”, all the features we exploit in models (20)–
(24) are forecasts of a variety of potentially informative
variables for time t. All these forecasts pertain to the 24
hours of the following day. In actual practice, models (20)–(24)
and (26)–(29) are trained using a rolling-window approach and
therefore, the training set depends on each time period t of the
T . The rolling training set is denoted here as T (t) and
test set
is illustrated in Fig. 1. Notice that the length of the training set
is kept constant as time progresses. Furthermore, there exists
a gap between the time period t and its corresponding training
set T (t). The reason for this gap is that the values of E, ψ−
and ψ+ for the time interval that goes from the moment the
forecasts are made available and time t are still not known
and consequently, such time periods cannot be used for the
training of the models (20)–(24) or (26)–(29).

e

This rolling-window approach allows us to dynamically
re-estimate the decision-rule parameters q and a in (20)–
(24) and (26)–(29), respectively, as the information on the
considered features is updated. Every time these parameters
are re-estimated, equations (25) and (30) are used to issue
improved forecasts and bids for time period t.

Critical to the training of models FM1–FM5 and TM is
determining the length |T (t)| of the training set. This length
deﬁnes when the data linked to certain days in the past have
become too old to be considered in the training process. We
devote the ﬁrst year of data to tune this length for models
FM1–FM5. In this time interval, the piece of data spanning

7

from 08/07/2015 to 02/02/2016 (180 days) is used as the
validation subset. We then compute the MAE on this subset
for each of the models FM1–FM5 and for different lengths
of the training subset, which we vary from one to seven
months. We remark that the length of the training set is the
only hyper-parameter that needs to be tuned for our models,
which represents an advantage in terms of ease of use and
implementation.

TABLE I. MAE reduction in percentage with respect to the benchmark for
different lengths of the training set in months.

Table I summarizes the results of this analysis, where
the MAE linked to each model and length is expressed in
percentage reduction with respect to the MAE associated with
the benchmark, namely, the onshore DK1-wind power forecast
issued by the Danish TSO. From this table, we notice that the
improvement in the performance of models FM1–FM5 that is
initially observed as we increase the length of the training set
not only ends up saturating, but even reverses as we extend the
training set beyond several months (e.g., six months in the case
of FM5). This is due to the fact that, at some point in time,
the information contained in the oldest data becomes obsolete
and thus, potentially misleading. In light of these results, we
set the length of the training set for forecasting to six months.
We proceed in a similar fashion to establish the length of the
dataset we use to train the trading model TM. In this case, we
change the validation subset to 06/03/2016–11/29/2016 (180
days). This change is required because model TM is fed with
the improved wind power forecast yielded by FM3 (the one
exhibiting the best trade-off between simplicity, data reliability
and forecasting performance). Consequently, training model
TM involves generating a sufﬁcient number of predictions
from model FM3 ﬁrst, which, in turn, is to be trained over a
dataset spanning six months. Hence, we need to reserve a big
chunk of data to study the impact of the length of the training
set on the performance of model TM. Table II shows the results
of this study for a length of the training set varying from one to
ten months. The numbers in the table correspond to the AOL
reduction of model TM in percentage with respect to the AOL
given by the benchmark, that is, the trading strategy consisting
in submitting the wind power prediction issued by the Danish
TSO to the pan-European electricity market. In view of these
results and for ease of implementation, we also set the length
of the training set for trading to six months.

IV. RESULTS

We divide this section in two parts. In the ﬁrst one,
we present and discuss the improvements in wind power
forecasting brought about by the linear decision rule that
results from (20)–(24). Subsequently, we elaborate on the
improvements in wind power trading that we attain by means
of model (26)–(29).

A. Improvements in Wind Power Forecasting

The ﬁrst and last days in the test set are 02/04/2016 and
04/22/2019. That is, the test set in the simulation comprises
1174 days in total. Table III provides the MAE and the RMSE
reductions (in percentage) with respect to the performance
metrics of the benchmark, namely, the raw forecast issued by
the Danish TSO.

TABLE III. MAE and RMSE reduction (in percentage) with respect to the
benchmark.

We observe that model (20)–(24), which, in essence, is an
easily implementable and computationally inexpensive linear
program, is able to substantially enhance the wind power
forecasts made by Energinet.dk. Actually, most of the reduc-
tion can be achieved by linearly combining Energinet.dk’s
predictions for the onshore and offshore DK1-wind power
productions (model FM1). From these results, we infer that
historical information of wind power forecasts pertaining to
neighboring bidding zones is not currently being exploited by
the Danish TSO. In contrast, the performance comparison of
models FM1 and FM2, on the one hand, and of models FM4
and FM5, on the other, seems to signal the fact that the “hour
of the day” and “day of the week”, and the day-ahead forecasts
of solar power production, scheduled generation and total load
in DK1 do not have predictive power on the targeted variable.
Besides, the comparison between FM1 and UM1 reveals that
a signiﬁcant improvement in the forecasting of the DK1-
onshore wind power production can be attained by enhancing
the quality of the forecasts in the areas adjacent to DK1.
However, the comparison between FM1, FM3, FM4 and UM2
further indicates that the bulk of this potential improvement is
to be attributed to the DK1 and DK2 wind-related features.
The models of the type of (20)–(24) that exhibit the best
forecasting performance are FM3, FM4 and FM5. Since the
ﬁrst one is signiﬁcantly simpler than the rest and offers the
best guarantees in terms of data reliability1, we use FM3 to
feed TM with the required wind power forecast. Interestingly,
even though models FM2 and FM5 exploit a larger number
of features than FM1 and FM4, respectively, their forecasting
performance is not (or barely) improved.

1Model FM3 uses data produced and uploaded at the same time to the
ENTSO-e Transparency Platform by the same entity, namely, the Danish TSO.
One can expect, therefore, that the forecasts contained in these data have been
built with the same past information available.

Fig. 3. Box plot of the coefﬁcients obtained for FM4 in the simulation period
02/04/16 to 04/22/2019.

For the sake of illustration, Fig. 2 plots the actual realization
of the wind power production in the time interval 01/01/16 to
01/08/16, together with the forecasts issued by Energinet.dk
(BM) and the proposed model FM3. It can be observed that
from hour 80 on, the forecast yielded by FM3 is always closer
to the actual wind power production than the forecast used by
the Danish TSO. On average, model FM3 produces forecasts
that, over the simulation period, deviate 100.44 MW with
respect to the true wind power values, whereas Energinet.dk’s
average deviation for this period amounts to 109.82 MW.

The simplicity of model (20)–(24) makes it more inter-
pretable than other forecasting models based, for instance,
on artiﬁcial neural networks. Not surprisingly, the coefﬁcient
corresponding to the onshore DK1-wind power forecast issued
by the Danish TSO is the largest one for the FM and
UM models. For example, its value in model FM4 ranges
from 0.8335 to 1.0267 over the simulation period. The other
coefﬁcient values of model FM4 are depicted in a box plot
in Fig. 3. As observed, the forecasts for the offshore DK1-
wind, the onshore and offshore DK2-wind, and the onshore
SE4-wind are also signiﬁcant.

B. Improvements in Wind Power Trading

The ﬁrst and last days of the test set, in this case, are
11/30/2016 and 04/22/2019, in that order. This means that the
test set in this simulation consists of 874 days. In this analysis
we assume that the wind power point forecast issued by each

model is directly bid into the day-ahead market and then we
compute the average opportunity loss as in (33).

If the forecasts issued by FM3 are used as bids, the AOL
is reduced by 1.30% with respect to the benchmark, which
consists in bidding the raw wind power point forecast issued
by the Danish TSO into the day-ahead market. Although model
FM3 is tailored to forecasting, the reduction of the prediction
error that it achieves is accompanied with an AOL decrease
too.

If the mid-term dynamics of the marginal opportunity costs
are accounted for through model TM, the AOL reduction in-
creases up to 2.13%. In this regard, the histogram of the values
taken on by the decision-rule parameter a over the simulation
period is plotted in Fig. 4. Interestingly, this parameter tends
to take values above 1, so as to proﬁt from the fact that, in
the DK1 bidding zone, overproduction is, on average, more
penalized than underproduction.

To further explain the AOL reduction achieved by TM, we
deﬁne next the empirical critical fractile estimated over the
training set T as:

R =

The ratio R balances the marginal opportunity cost for over-
production and the marginal opportunity cost for either under-
or overproduction, all of them averaged over T . A value of
R higher than 0.5 means that the opportunity cost for over-
production was more signiﬁcant than that for underproduction
throughout the training period. In such a case, the optimal
market bid should be higher than the forecast production in
order to hedge against overproduction. Conversely, if R is
lower than 0.5, the optimal market bid should be lower than
the forecast production.

This is because the series of balancing prices is scattered with
highly unpredictable spikes. Indeed, the limited predictability
of balancing prices is what makes the trading strategy con-
sisting in minimizing expected deviations so hard to beat. To
ﬁnish this section, we note that a similar experiment could
be conducted for a particular wind farm or a particular wind
power producer. To illustrate the beneﬁts of our approach,
however, we have decided to work on the aggregate onshore
DK1-wind power production for several reasons. First, there
is a rich set of market data related to DK1 and sorrounding
bidding zones publicly available in the ENTSO-e Transparency
Platform, while analogous datasets for particular wind farms
or producers are usually kept conﬁdential. Second, DK1 uses
a dual-price balancing settlement, and lastly,
the onshore
installed wind power capacity in DK1 amounts to 3669 MW.
Today, portfolios of similar size can be easily found in
countries such as Spain, United Kingdom or Germany [33].

Fig. 5 depicts the time evolution of the decision-rule pa-
rameter a in TM together with the ratio R over the simu-
lation period 11/30/16-04/22/19. As observed, the value of
a continuously adapts to the variations of R as the training
period T moves forward. This way, the bids provided by
TM take into account the mid-term dynamics of ψ− and ψ+
to properly hedge against under or overproduction. Finally,
Fig. 6 illustrates the accrued reduction in opportunity loss
achieved by model TM with respect to the benchmark over
the simulation period. Note that the plot is studded with time
instants when the accrued improvement suddenly decreases.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have proposed an inexpensive, easy-to-
implement, but effective method to enhance the tasks of
renewable energy forecasting and trading. Our method is based
on a data-driven newsvendor-type optimization model that
leverages extra available information to produce an improved
renewable energy forecast or a renewable energy bid that can
be directly placed in the day-ahead electricity market.

The effectiveness of our approach is tested on a realistic case
study where we aim, on the one hand, to improve the forecast

issued by the Danish TSO for the onshore wind power produc-
tion in the DK1 bidding zone of the pan-European electricity
market, and, on the other, to formulate a competitive market
bid for such a production. To this end, we build a rolling-
window simulation setup that mimics the actual processes of
forecasting and bidding and exploits the information available
at the moment the forecast must be issued or the bid must be
placed.

The numerical results highlight the beneﬁts achieved by
our approach, which amounts to a 8.53% of reduction in
MAE and a 2.13% of improvement of AOL with respect to
the benchmarks for the simulation period considered. These
ﬁgures point out the intrinsic value of exploiting additional
information such as spatially correlated forecasts. In this line,
we have observed that the use (as features) of both on- and
offshore wind power forecasts in areas geographically close to
the zone to which the target wind power production belongs
are valuable. This seems to be especially true if those areas
pertain to the same country or domain of the same TSO.

Future work could be focused on the development of robust
counterparts of the proposed models with the aim of reducing
the volatility of the improvements achieved. Variable selection
methodologies could also be implemented to determine the
best subset of regressors to feed in the models and to enhance
model interpretability. Likewise, nonlinear mappings between
the features and the response variable could be captured
within our approach by performing nonlinear transformations
on the features or by way of kernels. Neither of these actions
would signiﬁcantly affect the computational complexity of
our models. More generally, adapting theory and techniques
from the rich ﬁeld of nonlinear regression to the data-driven
framework we propose is indeed a relevant path to follow in
future research.

Finally, while the data-driven model for renewable energy
trading we develop is tailored to electricity markets with a
dual-price settlement for imbalances, such as Nordpool-DK1
or MIBEL (Spain), it could also be adapted to any market
where deviations with respect to a predeﬁned forward schedule
entail an opportunity cost.
