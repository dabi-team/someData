Abstract 
All groups of people felt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation triggers anxiety, which 
is  bad  for  everyone.  The  government's  role  is  very  influential  in  solving  these  problems  with  its  work 
program. It also has many pros and cons that cause public anxiety. For that, it is necessary to detect anxiety 
to improve government programs that can increase public expectations. This study applies machine learning 
to detecting anxiety based on social media comments regarding government programs to deal with this 
pandemic. This concept will adopt a sentiment analysis in detecting anxiety based on positive and negative 
comments from netizens. The machine learning methods implemented include K-NN, Bernoulli, Decision 
Tree  Classifier,  Support  Vector  Classifier,  Random  Forest,  and XG-boost.  The  data  sample  used  is  the 
result of crawling YouTube comments. The data used amounted to 4862 comments consisting of negative 
and positive data with 3211 and 1651. Negative data identify anxiety, while positive data identifies hope 
(not anxious). Machine learning is processed based on feature extraction of count-vectorization and TF-
IDF. The results showed that the sentiment data amounted to 3889 and 973 in testing, and training with the 
greatest  accuracy  was  the  random  forest  with  feature  extraction  of  vectorization  count  and  TF-IDF  of 
84.99% and 82.63%, respectively. The best precision test is K-NN, while the best recall is XG-Boost. Thus, 
Random Forest is the best accurate to detect someone's anxiety based-on data from social media.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  took  the  world  by  storm  and  became  a  rapidly  expanding 
pandemic [44]. This virus was initially submitted and identified from the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-
nCoV) report on [45]. This virus spread rapidly throughout the world, originating from Wuhan, China [48]. 
This pandemic also made Indonesia very fast in early March 2020 [6, 33, 39]. This case creates anxiety and 
anxiety  for  everyone,  including  the  community  and  government  in  Indonesia.  The  government  plays  a 
significant role in handling pandemics and seeks to neutralize and stop pandemics with various programs 
[35]. The programs launched are the supply of medical devices [23], provision of assistance [38], and free 
electricity [34]. 

These government programs have pros and cons, which can be seen in various news and social media. 
Comments and feedback on social media are highly visible and indicate whether there is anxiety or not. 
Everyone can make comments and feedback from all walks of life. News in the Covid-19 pandemic, such 
as details of the spread, death rates, and government programs for handling it, has a massive impact on the 
community's psyche, such as anxiety and panic  [30]. Thus, this conditions make the panic epidemic on 
social media and spread more than the COVID-19 epidemic itself [1]. 

Anxiety can be detected using the concept of sentiment analysis [2, 27, 46], especially in text processing. 
The study explains that sentiment analysis is used to detect anxiety based on one's social media, both from 
sharing information and feedback (comments) [25]. The concept of text mining in identifying sentiment 
has not been explained. Besides, related studies explain that anxiety can be detected based on social media 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic [17, 24]. A psychologist can analyze anxiety detection. However, along 
with the development of technology and the concept of text mining, anxiety detection can be done quickly 
and precisely based on training data using machine learning. This concept process used an analysis of a 
person's sentiment in responding to the pandemic and government programs in dealing with the COVID-
19 pandemic. The analysis is based on text-based on YouTube comments. Machine learning methods are

K-NN, Bernoulli, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and XG-boost. This 
process used the feature extraction of text data processing, namely Count-vectorization and TF-IDF. 

This article contains some of the five main sections. The first part is a literature review describing related 
studies  regarding  machine  learning  in  text  mining  processing  and  its  differences.  The  second  part  is  a 
method for all the processes and the steps and methods used in this research. The fourth explains the results 
and discussion of this research. The last section contains the conclusions of the research based-on result 
and discussion. 

II.  LITERATURE REVIEW 

Text mining can detect human emotions based on data from social media. This research has been done, 
but it is not satisfactory and is still developing. Emotion detection research divides two emotions, namely 
hate and non-hate. Besides, the distribution of feelings is also divided into three types: strong hate, weak 
hate,  and  no  hate  [40].  In  its  identification,  this  study  analyzes  emotions  in  the  form  of  detection  of 
fanaticism in the document text. In the detection of fanaticism, the concept of fanaticism  is divided into 
three,  namely  non-fanaticism,  Code  Attitude  fanaticism,  and  Code  Red  Fanaticism.  These  concepts  are 
classified using Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Naïve Bayes methods with an accuracy of up to 77% 
[3]. 

Because the accuracy is still low, the research is continued using the machine learning concept, using 
the Random Forest method. However, in this study, the accuracy rate fell to 72% [19]. The research was 
published in Arabic language newspapers, including Al-Jazeera, Al-Arabia, Al-Watan, and Al-Qabas. The 
implementation of machine learning methods in the classification process reaches 96%. The methods used 
are  C4.5,  RIPPER,  and  PART.  These  results  are  included  in  the  structured  domain  [4].  After  that,  this 
research was developed using the feature extraction method. The feature extraction methods used include 
TF-IDF, Support Vector Machine, and Naïve Bayesian. Implementation with the feature extraction method 
yields an accuracy of 82.1% [5]. 

Research  in  sentiment  analysis  can  detect  hate  speech  based  on  data  from  Facebook.  This  research 
belongs to unstructured sentiment analysis [40]. The application of the Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
method and a particular Recurrent Neural Network, namely Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), were tested 
for  performance  in  emotion  recognition.  Emotions  identified  by  this  method  are  positive  and  negative 
emotions. The study resulted in the effectiveness of both approaches in the Italian language domain. Other 
studies also apply the lexicon method and a combination of sentiment dictionaries and sentiment corpus in 
the sentiment detection process. This method is a model for detecting sentiment in English. The test results 
produce  an  accuracy  of  73%  [15].  Besides,  sentiment  analysis  detection  can  be  carried  out  using  two 
methods: a two-step method for hate speech detection and embedding techniques. The process is carried 
out by conducting training using a binary classifier that can separate hateful and neutral comments [11]. 

Emotional detection on social media is carried out using many concepts, one of which is detecting public 
sentiment in online media. This detection is based on the negative sentiment, which is defined as displeasing 
utterances related to religion, gender, and specific ethnicity [43]. Besides, related research detects sentiment 
using the two-step method [11]. Likewise, in other studies, sentiment analysis in the detection process is 
based  on  individual  objects  oriented  towards  race,  nationality,  and  religion  [15].  Analysis  of  sentiment 
detection is automatically processed using natural language processing [32] using text data on social media, 
including analytical sentiment detection on Facebook [40]. 

The detection of one's expectations is also carried out using social media data in the political domain 
[8]. The data used is data from Twitter. Researches with the theme of detection of mass anxiety and fear 
have also been carried out in various circumstances, namely during political wars [10, natural earthquake 
disasters [41], and in Youtube video comments [9]. However, the results of the research conducted have 
not shown maximum results. The application of machine learning is not an ensemble method, so this study 
applies the ensemble method such as Random Forest, XG-Boost, and others. 

III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

There  are  four  main  steps  taken  in  this  research:  data  collection,  system  analysis  and  concepts,  and 
system  design.  Data  collection  is  done  by  looking  for  literature  studies  to  get  an  overview  and literacy 
related to machine learning and text mining following the problems being solved. The concept of literacy 
studies is used to solve anxiety cases that exist in Indonesia today, mainly based on comments from social 
media. This social media can identify comments and feedback from users [29]. Besides, data collection was 
carried out directly using observation to obtain appropriate data. So that the data processed is following the 
data  obtained  on  social  media.  The  study's  data  collection  was  carried  out  by  observing  and  taking 

 
 
 
 
3 

comments  from  YouTube  videos  [26].  The  data  used  is  YouTube  comment  data,  which  is  related  to 
government programs related to free electricity. This study uses data in Indonesian. Every comment from 
someone  is  identified  about  the  existing  emotion  based  on  positive  and  negative  sentiments.  Positive 
sentiment is optimistic hope, while negative sentiment is someone's anxiety. 

This research has a concept of technology and computerization. Besides, the machine learning concept 
is  used  in  the  resolution  of  anxiety  detection  cases.  This  research  is  developing  previous  research  on 
machine  learning  detection  but  only  applies  the  random  forest  and  XG-Boost  methods  [12].  The 
development of this research is the application of feature extraction methods with Count-Vectorization and 
TF-IDF and machine learning methods using K-NN, Bernoulli, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector 
Classifier,  Random  Forest,  and  XG-Boost.  System  development  is  carried  out  using  system  design 
techniques, namely prototyping. This technique aims to model a system for detecting sentiment based on 
social  media  emotions  [7,  14].  The  prototyping  process  uses  three  main  stages  in  text  processing: 
preprocessing,  emotion  detection  based  on  sentiment  analysis,  and  cross-validation  testing.  The 
preprocessing stage is shown in Figure 1. Preprocessing is carried out to obtain precise text data and can be 
processed in the next stage. This process begins with the process of crawling data from YouTube comments, 
then preprocessing. The crawling data is temporarily stored in the database for preprocessing so that the 
data  is  normal  and  detected.  This  study's  preprocessing  stages  include  tokenizing,  filtering,  stemming, 
tagging, and the emoticon conversion process. The preprocessing results are in the form of clean text data, 
which is stored and processed further. 

Figure 1. Pre-processing based on YouTube comments regarding the Government Electricity Program 

Based on Figure 1, the results are further processed using feature extraction. The feature extraction used 
includes  the  Count-Vectorization  and  TF-IDF  (Term  Frequency  Inverse  Document  Frequency).  Count-
Vectorization  is  a  method  used  to  count  all  the  corpus  words  and  make  them  representations  of  the 
document. This method only counts the word frequency. Meanwhile, TF-IDF is a method used to calculate 
the weight of each word that is commonly used. The method has advantages in several factors, such as 
efficiency, ease, and accuracy. This method aims to calculate the value of the Term Frequency (TF) and 
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of each token (word) of each document in the corpus. Alternatively, 
the TF-IDF method serves to find out how often the word appears. It is the first step in the machine learning 
process stages, according to Figure 2. 

Machine learning will process data based on the results of feature extraction. This machine learning 
process  is  a  concept  used  to  detect  sentiments  and  emotions  based  on  the  text  whose  comments  are 
processed. As stated in the development of previous studies, this study uses five machine learning methods 
for the detection process. The result will be a training and testing process. The results of the training and 
test data are calculated for its accuracy using cross-validation. Apart from accuracy, other calculations use 
precision and recall functions.

Figure 2. The stages of Machine Learning and the results 

Machine learning uses the K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbor) method, Bernoulli, Decision Tree Classifier, 
Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and XG-Boost. KNN is used in the classification process by 
finding the closest K match based on training data [28]. Furthermore, the closest match label is used in the 
prediction. In general, the distance used is the euclidean distance in finding the closest match. The second 
method is Bernoulli. The model is used only to ignore the number of occurrences [21, 42]. Bernoulli's Naïve 
Bayes classification is a model that specifies that a document is represented by a binary attribute vector that 
indicates words that appear and do not appear in the document [22]. 

The  decision  tree  is  a  method  of  classification  and  pattern  prediction  from  data.  It  describes  the 
relationship of the attribute variable x and target y in the form of a tree. The decision tree has a structure 
like a flowchart, where the internal node is a test of the attribute variable (not the leaf / outermost), each 
branch is the test result, and the outer node is the leaf, which is the label  [37]. Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) is a relatively new technique for making predictions, both in classification and regression. Support 
Vector Machine is included in the supervised learning class. Its implementation must have a training stage 
using SVM sequential training and followed by the testing phase. The concept of classification with the 
Support Vector Machine is to find the best hyperplane that functions as a separator of two data classes. The 
Support Vector Machine can work on high-dimensional datasets using kernel tricks. The Support Vector 
Machine only uses a few selected data points that contribute (support vector) to form a model used in the 
classification process [31]. 

Random Forest (RF) is a classification algorithm that can be used to identify sentiment analysis [36, 20] 
and  emotion  analysis  [16,  18]  in  numbers  significant  data.  Random  forest  is  a  classification  based  on 
combining tree structures with training on the sample data they have. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG-
Boost) is a tree-based classification algorithm development [13]. This algorithm mimics the behavior of 
Random forest in its tree creation and is also combined with gradient descent / boosting. Gradient Boosting 
is a machine learning concept in solving regression problems whose classification produces a predictive 
model in a weak ensemble prediction model [47]. This boosting method can predict the error/residual from 
the previous model. XG-Boost is the GBM version with advantages in the process; namely, it is efficient 
and  scalable.  XG-Boost  performs  well  in  performing  functions  such  as  regression,  classification,  and 
ranking.  XG-Boost  is  also  called  a  tree  ensembles  algorithm,  which  collects  several  classifications  and 
regression trees (CART). 

Cross-validation is an iterative validation process in which the dataset is divided into many subsets (sets) 
of training & validation data. In this study, the method used is the confusion matrix, a method of measuring 
performance in the classification method. Measurements are processed by sharing the classification results 
in real terms and processed according to the classification components in Table 1.

In this study, the confusion matrix concept used calculates accuracy, precision, and recall. Accuracy is 
a process that determines the validity of the data based on the calculation between the measurement result 
and its real value (proximity). Accuracy can be calculated by (1). Apart from accuracy, precision and recall 
are also implemented in the performance evaluation process in this study. Both methods are calculations 
that can strengthen the results of the accuracy measurement process. Precision and recall are measurements 
of data accuracy and are measured by (2), while recall is a measure of the completeness of data and can be

and is divided by the total number of positive sentiment classification samples.

IV. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION 

In this study, there are results and discussions related to the experiments that have been carried out. The 
details obtained in this experiment include explaining the dataset, the results, and discussions related to the 
anxiety detection process based on sentiment analysis of social media data. The experimental results also 
checked the validation of the method using cross-validation based on the test results. The detailed validation 
calculations use three methods, namely accuracy, precision, and recall. 

A. Dataset and Labeling Process 

This study uses data from YouTube comments by the crawling process. The data taken is based on the 
conditions  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  regarding  the  free  electricity  program  from  the  Indonesian 
government. The total dataset is 4,862 data of type integer. The data is divided into two categories, namely, 
positive and negative. Positive comments on this study have a total of 1651 positive comments from people 
who  provide  comments.  Meanwhile,  negative  comments  have  a  total  data  volume  of  3211  negative 
comments from people who comment on the video. Positive comment data means that a person's condition 
has an anxiety value = 0 so that he has positive expectations. Meanwhile, negative comments mean someone 
has an anxious state. The classification results are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 illustrates the percentage of classification in detecting anxiety using the Indonesian sample 
based on YouTube comments. The sentences used are shown in Table 2. The dataset is classified into two 
categories, namely negative and positive. In Table 2, the sample data has a sample of five each for positive 
and negative comment data in Indonesian.

B. Experiment Results and Discussion 

The  experimental  process  was  carried  out  using  crawled  data.  The  results  of  crawling  data  from 
YouTube comments are presented in Table 2 as a sample. The data is pre-processed to obtain clean data for 
further processing. This process fully uses the Python programming language.  Classification result data 
was carried out using two data groupings, namely negative and positive. Python implementation uses a 
design as in the research in Figure 1 and Figure 2 for the process flow. 

The process begins by reading the data and then preprocessing. Preprocessing aims to clean data. The 
resulting  data  is  a core  that  has  no  noise. This  process  is  carried  out  with several  processes,  including: 
tokenizing,  filtering  (slank  word  conversion,  remove  the  number,  remove  stopword,  remove  the  figure, 
remove  duplicate),  stemming,  emoticon conversion.  In  the conversion  process, emoticons  have  rules to 
improve data cleanliness. Additional rules besides the process are as follows: 

a.There is a single figure word; it is necessary to add the word "support". The result is positive sentiment 

and emotional trust = 1 

b.There is an exclamation mark, then the emotion of trust = 2 
c.In one dominant capital letter sentence, angry emotions = 1 
d.There is an angry emotion exclamation mark = 2 
Here  is  a  coding  sample  in  Python  to  display  the  conversion  of  emotions  from  comment  text.  The 
conversion result is a complete sentence without emoticons. This is because the emoticon is converted into 
a  complete  sentence,  what  changes  is  the  emoticon  becomes  the  sentence  "....  face_with_tears_of_joy. 
face_with_tears_of_joy. face_with_tears_of_joy." Because there are three emotions, they are all written 
down. 
kalimat=(conv_emoticon("Subsidi listrik saya dicabut. R1 jadi R1M...Bpjs saya
 kena pengurangan.Auto kaya SAYA!! Dimata pak presiden pastinya😂😂😂")) 
for kata in kalimat.split(): print(kata) 

This process is a preprocessing, which is processed in full by coding using Python. In detail, Python 
commands and execution results can be seen in Figure 4 according to the design in Figure 1. The final result 
of  this  preprocessing  is  clean  data.  Result  data  is  data  that  has  meaning  for  the  next  process.  The 
preprocessing  eliminates  meaningless/useless  text.  The  concept  of  data  cleaning  can  be  seen  from  the 
column named "text" as the initial data and turned into the preprocessing data "clean_text" column. The 
clean data becomes the data used in anxiety detection so that the results obtained are better because vital 
information is used in the process. 

Figure 4. Preprocessing Results that have clean data 

The preprocessing result data is in the form of clean data, which is processed by feature extraction. By 
the  method  presented  in  Figure  2,  the  methods  used  include  Count-Vectorization  and  TF-IDF.  This 
method's  results  are  feature  extraction  data  processed  using  machine  learning  methods,  namely  K-NN, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bernoulli, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and XG-Boost. The code 
syntax in Python can be seen in Figure 5.

calculations based on the Random Forest method

(b) 

Based on Figure 5, the use of feature extraction methods and machine learning in anxiety detection is 
implemented in Figure 6. These implementation results are examples of applying the feature extraction 
method using Count-Vectorization, and the machine learning method using the random forest method. The 
validation process uses the application of formulas (1), (2), and (3), which are coded in Python with the 
functions provided in the python library. 

Based on the matrix results in Figure 6, the results of the test results for each feature extraction method 
and machine learning are shown in Table 3. The highest accuracy result is the random forest method based 
on each feature extraction Count-Vectorization and TF-IDF with successive values are 84.99% and 82.63%. 
The highest scores for precision and recall are K-NN and XG-Boost, respectively. Although the precision 
or recall values for both are high, they cannot serve as a reference for anxiety detection recommendations. 
That is because the value of the two (recall/precision) is not balanced. Thus, the best consistency of all 
methods that have been processed with Python is the Random Forest (the result shown in Figure 7). 

Apart from Random Forest, the application of machine learning methods with an accuracy of more than 
80% and are at least balanced in calculating precision and recall can be considered. The methods that can 
be considered include Bernoulli, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Classifier. The three methods apart 
from having an accuracy of more than 80%, the precision and recall can be balanced. The precision and 
recall values were more than 60. Each result had differences that were not that far off, with a maximum 
difference of about 20% of the results.

V.  CONCLUSION 

The experiment and discussion results explain that the best machine learning method recommended in 
this study is the Random Forest method. Cross-Validation Testing, especially the level of accuracy, the 
random forest has an accuracy rate of close to 85% with Count-Vectorization feature extraction compared 
to all the machine learning methods used. The results showed that the sentiment data amounted to 3889 and 
973 in testing and this study. The best precision test is K-NN, while the best recall is XG-Boost, but other 
values don't support it. Even so, the accuracy of applying machine learning methods with an accuracy of 
more than 80% includes Bernoulli, Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier, and Random Forest. Thus, 
Random Forest can be the best reference for applying machine learning methods to detect anxiety based on 
social  media  data.  In  addition to the  best  accuracy,  the  random  forest  also  has significant and  bettef  of 
precision and recall values are compared to other methods.
