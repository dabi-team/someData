Abstract – Deeplearning algorithms are revolutionising many aspects of modern life. Typically, 
they are implemented in CMOS-based hardware with severely limited memory access times and 
inefficient data-routing. All-optical neural networks without any electro-optic conversions  could 
alleviate  these  shortcomings. However,  an  all-optical  nonlinear  activation  function,  which is  a 
vital building block for optical neural networks, needs to be developed efficiently on-chip. Here, 
we  introduce  and  demonstrate  both  optical  synapse  weighting  and  all-optical  nonlinear 
thresholding using two different effects in a chalcogenide material photonic platform. We show 
how the structural phase transitions in a wide-bandgap phase-change material enables storing 
the  neural  network  weights  via  non-volatile  photonic  memory,  whilst  resonant  bond 
destabilisation is used as a nonlinear activation threshold without changing the material. These 
two different transitions within chalcogenides enable programmable neural networks with near-
zero  static  power  consumption  once  trained,  in  addition  to  picosecond  delays  performing 
inference tasks not limited by wire charging that limit electrical circuits; for instance, we show 
that  nanosecond-order  weight  programming  and  near-instantaneous  weight  updates  enable 
accurate inference tasks within 20 picoseconds in a 3-layer all-optical neural network. Optical 
neural networks that bypass electro-optic conversion altogether hold promise for network-edge 
machine  learning  applications  where    decision-making  in  real-time  are  critical,  such  as  for 
autonomous vehicles or navigation  systems such as signal pre-processing of LIDAR systems.    

Introduction 

Machine learning has become an essential part of societies, where systems are progressively exploiting 

(un)supervised  deeplearning  to  detect  objects,  recognize  speech,  translate  languages,  or  make 

decisions.  However,  demand  for  machine  learning  computing  outweighs  supply  due  to  three 

bottlenecked requirements for information processing; (i) data movement across distributed networks 

or  circuits,  (ii)  efficient  performance  of  multiply-accumulate  (MAC)  operations  enabling  tensor 

operations  such  as  matrix-vector  multiplications  (MVMs),  and  (iii)  providing  nonlinearity  at  each 

neuron,  known  as  thresholding.  Thus,  next-generation  efficient  and  high-performance  artificial 

intelligence (AI) hardware must deliver each function, (i) to (iii), as optimized physical hardware since 

a  one-fits-all  approach  leads  to  processor  limitations.  Such  hardware  optimization  is  known  as 

algorithm-to-hardware homomorphism, and such synergistic co-design was performed in developing 

the deep all-optical photonic neural network introduced here. Currently, deeplearning algorithms are 

implemented in digital electronic van Neumann-type computing systems (i.e. systolic arrays1 or SIMD 

units 2). State-of-the-art graphic processing units (GPU) and tensor processing units (TPU) accelerators 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
show  performance  values  around  0.5-1  pJ/MAC,  0.5-1  TMAC/s/mm2,  0.5-1  GMVM/s,  and  1-2  µs 

delay3.  While  digital  electronic  AI  hardware  is  able  to  provide  seamless  nonlinearity  and  memory 

functionality to store trained  weights, there are two significant limitations: (a) data  communication 

bottleneck  where  the  signaling  energy  consumptions  scales  with  the  circuit  capacitance,  and  b) 

algebraic operations (e.g. MAC, MVM, tensor)  requiring power hungry  and delay-prone  electronic 

circuity. Thus, machinery to coordinate the data movement involved in both weights and activations 

result in high overhead and delay. In fact for the last decade already, data movement outweighs data 

operations, opening a gap between these two domains. Optical signals are fundamentally well suited 

for communication, given the non-existence of an optical capacitance for traveling-wave systems. In 

addition to utilizing efficient photonic communication, here we discuss and introduce optical algebra 

both  for  linear  but  more  importantly  for  nonlinearity,  with  the  latter  being  critical  for  deep  neural 

network  architectures.  Such  depth  is  important  since  it  is  the  key  for  many  machine  learning 

algorithms, especially those relying on gradient descent back-propagation during training.   

Indeed,  light  is  an  established  communication  medium  and  is  used  to  successfully  address  data 

movement (e.g. waveguides, fibers) and high fan-out (e.g. beam splitters). Thus, optics can seamlessly 

provide the required interconnectivity set by the distributed nature of neural networks. Furthermore, 

the  compactness  of  photonic  integrated  circuits  (PIC)  paired  with  non-circuit-size  related  light 

propagation  speeds  (unlike  electronic  circuits),  allows  for  picosecond-short  signal  delays  between 

neurons.  Despite  such  prospects,  the  more  interesting  question  is,  whether  one  can  perform 

mathematical operations, namely linear MVM and nonlinear thresholding, efficiently and fast in the 

optical  domain?  The  question  is  fair,  since  typical  compute-functionality  such  as  nonlinearity, 

memory, or gain, are cumbersome to be performed optically and/or on-chip. Yet, linear algebra, such 

as  for  MAC  operations  and  MVMs  are  implementable  in  photonics  enabled  by  either  interference 

effects  or  by  passing  an  optical  signal  through  an  optical-index  modulating  linear  device  (e.g. 

modulator4). Such PIC-based linear operation processors include Mach–Zehnder interferometer5, ring-

filters6, or all-optically implemented by nonlinear light-matter interactions, for example. Conceptually, 

optical linear information processing can be further parallelized by exploiting time7, space8,9, or the 

wide spectrum such as in wavelength division multiplexing schemes6. However, in the context of chip-

based photonic AI technologies, implementation options are limited, and interferometric-approaches 

are challenging to control due to high sensitivity and do not scale well (e.g. N2 MZI’s are required to 

implement N neurons). Most limiting, yet, is the conversion to electronics after each MVM operation5; 

optically accelerating MVMs just to be limited by electronic circuits for the nonlinear thresholding 

operation, followed by iteratively re-using the same photonic chip, hurts system delay, and makes such 

photonic neural network approaches questionable.   

 
 
Here, we introduce a novel all-optical photonic neural network paradigm harnessing the full potential 

from  light-based  machine  learning  acceleration  featuring;  (i)  no  domain  crossings  (i.e.  no  O-E-O 

conversions needed); (ii) linear and nonlinear operations performed optically on-chip and via the same 

material class hence reducing fabrication complexity and future system cost; (iii) photonic nonvolatile 

memory  to  store  the  neural  network  weights  offering  near-zero  static  power  consumption;  (iv) 

cascadability  by  providing  nonlinear  activation  functions  (NLAF)  optically  on-chip  enabling  deep 

architectures; (v) response times for inference tasks of 10’s ps enabling near real-time decision making; 

and  (vi)  demonstrating  the  above  in  silicon  photonic  platform  where  the  functional  light-matter-

interactions are enhanced by heterogeneous integration by a single foundry-near material class (i.e. 

chalcogenides).  Overall,  this  paradigm  for  photonic  neural  networks  is  attractive  because  the 

computation  and  memory  takes  place  in  the  same  physical  location  thus  bypassing  the  infamous 

memory-access bottleneck and hence suppressing latency; i.e. in-memory photonic computing. 

Phase change materials (PCM) are leading candidates for setting synaptic weights in optical neural 

networks. This is because they exhibit substantial optical contrast between structurally ordered and 

disordered states, are foundry processable, and commercially proven in related technologies, such as 

re-writeable optical discs, and more recently in non-volatile electronic memory.  The most commonly 

employed PCM is Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), which is capable of fast reversible transitions in its refractive 

index.  Its  potential  as  an  electro-refractive  memory  element  in  integrated  photonic  chips  has  been 

demonstrated  in  coupler-based10,11,  cavity-based12–14  and  absorptive  schemes15,  and  GST  memory 

elements can be programmed optically (all-photonic16) or electro-thermally by either passing a current 

through the GST such as using micro-heaters17,18. However, GST’s application for in-memory photonic 

computing is hindered by (1) it high optical absorption from inter-band transitions at photon energies 

above 0.7 eV19, which limits the depth (i.e. multi-layer) of the neural network; (2) hence this loss also 

restricts the number of optical levels (bit-density)16,20 which impacts the accuracy of inference tasks; 

and (3) the phase transition time which limits the latency (signal delay) through the neural network.  

To address the inefficiencies of current photonic neural networks, we adopt reprogrammable 

photonic devices made of two different  chalcogenides. To overcome the high optical absorption of 

GST,  we  adopt  Sb2S3  to  set  the  synaptic  weights.  Sb2S3  is  a  wide-bandgap  PCM  and  is  therefore 

transparent across the telecoms spectral bands whilst retaining an almost unity change in refractive 

index  between  its  amorphous  and  crystalline  states.  In  contrast  to  phase  transitions,  we  employ  an 

underexploited  highly  nonlinear  disruption  of  resonant  bonding  in  crystalline  GST  for  the  NLAF. 

Combining  optical  nonlinear  spectroscopy  measurements  with  full-wave  and 

interconnect 

simulations21, we show an all-optical artificial neuron not requiring any O-E or E-O conversions until 

the very last layer of a deep architecture. This concept synergistically embeds the synaptic nonvolatile 

(programmed)  weights  and  volatile  NLAF  with  the  same  material  (here  GST)  framework 

heterogeneously  integrated  atop  a  silicon  photonics  neural  network  platform.  The  photonic  neuron 

 
 
exploits  nonvolatile  structural  transition  (Dn  =  unity)  while  exhibiting  ultra-low-losses  (k =  10-4  at 

NIR)  PCM22  for  programmable  MVM  operations,  and  experimentally  demonstrates  volatile  rapid 

transitions23 as NLAF. Exemplary, the quantized synapses  are obtained through  a cascade of ultra-

low-losses Sb2S3-based22 broadband 4-bit switches operating as an optical FPGA and here referred to 

as  photonic  programmable  phase-change  array  (P3A),  while  the  NLAF  is  achieved  by  deploying  a 

reversible and rapid (< 10 ps) non-thermal modulation of the dielectric function of a GST film. Here, 

we reveal for the first time, that the co-participation of two competing phenomena in the GST material, 

i.e. fs-laser induced depletion of electrons from resonantly bonded states and near-infrared free-carrier 

optical  absorption,  produce  a  strong  nonlinearity,  whose  shape  ultimately  allows  for  an  accurate 

prediction during inference phase (Fig. 1a). A multi-level  (2-layer) perceptron feed-forward neural 

network  based  on  these  novel  all-optical  photonic  neurons,  is  trained  using  a  photonic  hardware 

model24 to accurately simulate the complete process and learn the weights including analog noise. The 

network  is  ultimately  emulated  on  an  open-source  machine  learning  framework.  After  training, 

classification is demonstrated on hand-written digits with a high level of accuracy (>90%) despite the 

relatively high levels of variability in the NLAF and weights. 

The  herein  introduced  all-optical  deep  neural  network  paradigm  enables  noise-robust 

intelligent in-memory computing with potential sub-picosecond latency for inference, which is limited 

only by the time-of-flight of the photon and the rapid thermalisation of the GST, but not by phase-

transitions.  Assuming  optical  input  signals,  the  network  can  perform  classification  of  the  MNIST 

handwritten digits consuming just 0.1µJ of optical energy, which is needed for  the nonlinear activation 

modules.  

Results 

The building block of our network is an artificial photonic neuron (Fig. 1b). Analogous to a biological 

neuron,  this  artificial  neuron  acquires optical  inputs  and  performs  a  weighted  addition  (linear  MAC 

operation)  using  the  photonic  programmable  phase-change  array  (P3A)  consisting  of  a  network  of 

programmable  photonic  latches  to  control  800  nm  signals  (SiN  waveguide  platform).  The  synaptic 

weights, which are acquired by off-line training, are then programmed as refractive index changes in 

an  ultra-low  loss  Sb2S3–based  multistate  photonic  phase  change  memory  material22.  These  Sb2S3 

memory elements are embedded in asymmetric directional couplers and is programmed using electrical 

Joule heat or all-optically using a pump laser15,16,25 (Fig. 1c). The optical output of this P3A is amplified 

in the optical domain using either on-chip semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) or Erbium Doped 

Fibre Amplifiers (EDFAs). All-optical amplification may be required for large multi-layer networks to 

ensure sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the back-end photodetector during high signal-speeds 

(e.g. 50-100 Gbps). After the linear weighted addition the optical signals interact with the GST layer 

nonlinearly  by  destabilizing  resonant  bonds,  altering  its  complex  permittivity  of  the  GST  film  on  a 

 
 
picosecond time scale23,26. This GST, now being in an excited state, influences the transmission of a 

second laser signal at 1550 nm, which is either attenuated or fed to a second layer of a photonic neural 

network, thus enabling a rapid NLAF (Fig. 1d). 

Figure 1. a, An artificial photonic neuron based on structural and electronic transitions in phase change 
materials.  Ultrafast  photoexcitation  forms a  transient  state by  removing the  resonant  bonds  and  changing the 
optical properties. Rapid energy extraction (using silicon slab waveguide as heat-sink) prevents amorphization 
allowing  for  a  volatile  transition.  Successive  heating,  after  several  picosecond,  causes  lattice  heating,  which 
thermally  melts  the  GST.  b,  Schematic  of  the  artificial  photonic  neuron  which  comprises  an  photonic 
programmable phase-change array (P3A), programmed according to quantized synaptic weights, and all-optical 
nonlinear activation function (NLAF) based on phase change materials (PCM). Inputs at 800 nm laser source are 
linearly combined according to a cascade of programmable switches (SiN-based photonics platform), the resulting 
optical  power  is amplified,  e.g.  using  erbium  doped  fiber  amplifier  (EDFA), and used as  pump  signal  for the 
optical NLAF module which uses a 1550 nm probe signal. The output of the NLAF is injected in the Si-based 
photonic layer. c, Weighting mechanism and summation rely on a cascade of Sb2S3-SiN hybrid photonic switches 
which performs the same operation as an optical equivalent of an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). The 
PCM is placed on one of side of the directional coupler (DC), and according to the portion of material written 
(crystalline to amorphous) the light is partially configured to the cross state. The phase of the film is thermally 
set, with a resolution of ~1 µm yielding to a total of 16 distinguishable states (4-bit). Fully amorphous PCM film 
configure  light  in  a  cross  state  of  the  DC  switch,  while  fully  crystalline  results  in  a  bar  state.  The  hybrid 
configurations in between bard- and cross states represent the intermediate states. d, The NLAF module consists 
of a single mode hybrid silicon waveguide covered for 1 µm by a 30 nm thick Ge2Sb2Te5 layer. A 1550 nm TM 
polarized light is used for sensing the nonlinear variation of the effective refractive index induced by the fs-laser 
coupling  into  the  PIC  e.g.,  from  free  space.  Plasmonic  antennas  could  be  used  for  enhancing  light  matter 
interaction.  After  the  NLAF  the  signal  could  be  either  detected  using  integrated  photodetector  or  passed  to  a 
second stage photonic waveguide.

Figure  2.  Optical-equivalent  of  an  electro-thermally  controlled  Programmable  Photonic  Phase-change 
Array (P3A) based on photonic nonvolatile memory on-chip. a) Schematic representation of the silicon nitride 
asymmetrical  directional  coupler  (DC)  operating  at  800  nm.  The  DC  is  composed  of  two  waveguides,  a  bare 
silicon nitride waveguide (SW, 500 nm width) and a hybrid Sb2S3-on-silicon nitride hybrid waveguide (HW, 420 
nm width), which are separated by a 120 nm gap. The thickness of the Sb2S3 is 20 nm. A free space laser source 
can be used for writing portion of the Sb2S3 film deposited on top of the hybrid waveguide with a writing resolution 
of 1 µm. According to the percentage of the portion of the Sb2S3 layer that is amorphized, the percentage of light 
which switches to the HW changes proportionally. Numerical approach used Comsol Multiphysics. 

The core of the P3A is an asymmetrical electro-optic programmable MZI-based switch operating at 800 

nm (Fig. 1c). The asymmetric coupling region comprises a bare silicon nitride waveguide (SW) and a 

hybrid Sb2S3-on-silicon nitride hybrid waveguide (HW), as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Sb2S3 is selected for a 

low  absorption  coefficient  at  800  nm  compared  to  GST  (Fig.  2  c-d)  which  yields  to  devices 

characterized by lower insertion losses in this frequency range.  Optimization of the dimension of the 

switch  ensure  smallest  footprint,  length  =  14  µm  for  4-bit  resolution,  which  is  relatively  compact 

compared to recent MZI-based weighting approaches5 (Fig. 2e). The MZI switch is designed to transmit 

via the SW arm of the coupler (bar-state) with low insertion loss (2 dB) when Sb2S3 is fully crystallized 

(Fig. 2e.i and Fig.2f.i). However, as the Sb2S3 is progressively amorphized, the SW light progressively 

couples towards the HW and the transmittance of the switch in the cross-state following the expected 

cosine squared function (Fig. S2) of the portion of amorphized layer (Fig. 2e.i-v and Fig.2f.i-v). Thus, 

when the HW low-loss Sb2S3 layer is fully amorphized, the switch meets the phase-matching condition 

for transverse electric (TE) polarization, leading to an insertion loss (IL) of 1.6 dB at 800 nm (Fig. 2f.v 

and  Fig.2e.v).  An  analog  or  multilevel  coupler  is  then  formed  by  controlling  the  length  of  the 

crystallised Sb2S3 film. We find that 4-bit quantization provides a reasonable trade-off between writing 

resolution  for  programming the  synaptic  weights  (~1µm)  and  an  inference  accuracy27.  Note,  higher 

resolutions  are  possible  too,  just  linearly  increasing  chip  footprint.  The  required  PCM-length  is 

determined by the downstream detector and the signal clock-speed to ensure a SNR > 1 is provided, 

 
  
 
 
 
and a sufficiently high bit-error-rate (BER) for the choses machine learning application. Further details 

of the P3A performance are presented in the SI.

Figure 3. Nonlinear activation function (NLAF) of photonic neurons. a, Pump-probe physics and temporal 
response of the all-optical nonlinear activation function based on resonant bond-state depopulation in GST thin 
films. Schematic of the pump probe setup. The 800 nm pump bears the weighted-addition (MAC) signal of 4-bit 
resolution from the upstream photonic perceptron (Fig. 1&2). Pump: fs-laser 35 fs pulses, λ = 800 nm. Probe:

in  extracted  dielectric  function  assuming  a  range  of  initial  thicknesses  for  the  GST  layer,  from  24-30  nm.  d, 
Nonlinear  activation function  (NLAF)  based  on  an  electro-absorptive  pump  and  probe  scheme The  electronic

signal, i.e. the P3A outputs modulated according to the previous weights, is coupled from free-space, amplified 
and focused onto each GST segments of the NLAF modules. e, Transmittance of the 1550 nm probe signal as

the  normalized  electric  field  distribution  for a  propagating hybrid TM  mode in  the  xz  and  yz planes  when  the 
dielectric constant of the GST film is (i.) in the crystalline phase and (ii.) has electronically transitioned due to the 
depletion  of  resonant  bonds  induced  by  the  fs  pump  laser.  f,  Crystallisation  of  GST.  The  change  in  optical 
reflectivity with temperature shows a logistic function is differentiated to determine the crystallisation temperature 
(see Methods and SOM). Inset: full temperature range, from room temperature to 250 ℃.   

Next, we experimentally test the on-chip all-optical NLAF via nonlinear time-resolved spectroscopy to 

determine the temporal response, power efficiency, and modulation depth of the GST-based photonic 

NLAF (Fig. 3). The transient changes to the near-normal reflectivity and transmissivity (Fig. 3a) are 

simultaneously  recorded  by  a 𝜆 = 1500 nm  time-delayed  probe  pulse  with  a  pump  at  l  =  800  nm 

delivering  the  4-bit  weighted  MAC  signal  from  the  upstream  photonic  perceptron.  The  dielectric 

function is then obtained by numerically inverting the Fresnel equations for the multi-layer structure 

assuming all changes occurred in the c-GST film (see Methods). The maximum change of the complex 

dielectric  function  occurs  0.75  ps  after  the  pump  pulse  (Fig.  3b)  enables  a  rapid  volatile  NLAF 

functionality at near-zero delay in performing inference tasks. Regarding the underlying physical effect 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
providing this observed nonlinearity, the change in the signal results from the combined effects of a 

Drude-like effect due to free carrier generation and the loss of resonant bonding, which primarily effects 

the real part of the dielectric function23. The transient response at two typical fluences displays a rapidly 

recovering response, within several picoseconds after excitation (Fig. 3c). A smaller offset persists for 

hundreds of picoseconds corresponding to the thermal change.19  

For the all-optical deep neural network, we design a NLAF photonic module that consists of a hybrid 

Si waveguide upon with a 1 µm long, 30 nm thick strip of crystalline GST patterned (Fig. 3d). This 

short  device  design  can  modulate  incoming  signals  at λ = 1550 nm  by  1.5  dB,  which  shows  that 

extremely compact photonic NLAF components are possible. To achieve these results, we first used a 

finite-difference time-domain approach to simulate the effect of λ = 800 nm pump light on λ = 1550 

nm signal transmission. The pump signal arriving from the linear weighting module (P3A, Fig. 1c) and 

the amplification stage, depopulates the resonantly bonded states in the crystalline GST and causes a 

concomitant decrease in the effective refractive index of the guided λ = 1550 nm TM mode. The higher 

the pump fluence, the lower the overall power signal output because the excitation increases the number 

of free carriers thus increasing absorption. The 3.5 dB insertion loss is caused by the non-negligible 

extinction coefficient of the c-GST layer in the crystalline state (Fig. 3e). A Cavity-based modulation 

scheme could be engineered to compensate for the higher insertion losses, but this would reduce the 

spectral bandwidth of this nonlinear device. The energy consumption of a single nonlinear node is 0.1 

nJ, and hence quite low. This compares well with bulkier resonant absorbers and electro-optic NLAF 

modules, since here the device has a footprint of just 1µm and does not require additional circuitry, 

which  is  critical  for  compact  neural  network  architectures.  Although,  non-linearity  could  be  further 

enhanced using plasmonics15, it would be at the expense of increased insertion losses due to the ohmic 

losses in the plasmonic metal.  

Training and Performance  

To  test  the  performance  of  the  all-chalcogenide  all-optical  deep  neural  networks,  we  explore  the 

performance of a 3-layer fully connected neural network composed of the photonic-P3A and photonic 

NLAF modules using Googles TensorFlow (Fig. 4). The system was trained on the MNIST dataset, 

which is a well-known standard that comprises of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The 

first  layer  receives  the  inputs  from  the  images  of  the  handwritten  images  and  does  not  apply  any 

weighting to the inputs. The second layer has 100 neurons, which receive inputs from the first layer 

with an all-to-all connection (100x100) and performs weighting (nonlinear quantized during inference). 

The all-optical NLAF28 are placed between two consecutive layers on each input connection (Fig. 4a-

b). The third layer reduces the dimensionality of the network and comprises just 10 neurons, which 

represent the outputs 0 to 9. The network is trained on the MNIST dataset utilizing both photonic P3A 

and NLAF modules. Unlike digital electronics where noise is artificially added to the training data to 

 
 
 
increase  the  networks  robustness,  photonic  neural  networks  being  analog  systems  bear  a  degree  of 

intrinsic noise. Testing the robustness of this all-photonic deep neural network, we monitor the inference 

accuracy as a function of switching variability (i.e. noise) from both the P3A and the NLAF (Fig. 4c)24;  

the general trends are as expected, namely a higher accuracy for less noise. The highest accuracies are 

achieved when 0.01% noise is added to the maximum signal swing at the neuron’s output. A possible 

explanation is that deliberately adding training noise can fine-tune the network for inference operation 

on physical noisy input signals. However, if the training noise is beyond 0.1% of the signal strength, 

the  inference  accuracy  decreases,  as  expected.  Strategies  for  further  increasing  the  accuracy  of  the 

network include: 1) increasing the bit resolution of the P3A and increasing the both number of neurons 

in each layer and the network depth; 2) adopt advanced quantization algorithms to better represent the 

information during training, and furthermore; 3) gradually add the quantization constraints in a training-

retraining flow to converge to a ‘better’ local optimum during the training.

depends  on  the  thermal  transients  of  GST  films  providing  the  neuron’s  nonlinearity,  (assuming  a  fixed  and 
programmed kernel. The temperature values are extracted from literature23 and the cooling behavior was simulated 
using the finite element method on COMSOL Multiphysics.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Next, we comment on the overall performance of this all-photonic deep neural network paradigm; as 

previously  reported,  the  lattice  temperature  achieved  for  below-threshold  excitation  (below 

amorphization) increases linearly with excitation fluence (up to 15 mJ cm-2), therefore the GST material 

patch must be quenched efficiently to enable high repetition rates. With higher fluences approaching 

GST’s melting point, the device must be able to efficiently dissipate heat (see SOM). The current device 

setup which has the Si3N4 waveguide can be further optimized to facilitate heat dissipation (cooling) 

via adding a metal sheets (yet there is a risk to increase insertion loss) or alternatively adding a graphene 

layer, which has a high thermal conductivity29.  

Assuming a fixed kernel (i.e. the linear MVM is programmed into the PCM materials), then the temporal 

bandwidth (speed) of the neural network performing passive inference tasks is dictated by the thermal 

response time of the GST element in the NLAF module to cool down. The underlying physical effect 

of the nonlinearity is based on electric-field induced depopulation of p-orbital electrons in the resonantly 

bonded GST crystal. However, as these electrons thermalize, the GST will increase in temperature. If 

the frequency of the pump pulses, corresponding to the data rate of the MVM signals, is too high, the 

GST temperature will equilibrate at temperatures above the 950 K melting temperature. The molten 

properties of GST are very different to the crystalline state30, and therefore it is important to ensure the 

pump laser repetition rate does not cause the GST element to melt. A thermal-transient analysis shows 

a MHz range for the threshold pump pulse frequency for stable operations for all tested fluences (Fig. 

4d).  The  lattice  temperatures  were  obtained  from  previous literature,  where  it  was  reported  that  the 

lattice temperature achieved for below-threshold excitation (below amorphization) increases linearly 

with excitation fluence (up to 15 mJ cm-2). The maximum operating frequency of the laser pulse was 

approximated to be 2.4 ns (~400 MHz) using 1-D heat diffusion equation (see SOM).  

This operating speed can be extended further by optimizing the thermal design of the nonlinearmodule, 

coherently pumping the A1 mode of the GeTe4 units in the GST crystal31, and using interfacial phase 

change  materials,  which  have  a  larger  thermal  conductivity32.  Moreover,  adding  a  highly  thermal 

conductive material like graphene29 in the device would dissipate the heat more efficiently.  Ultimately, 

the network’s theoretical inference latency is limited by the time-of-flight through the network, which 

is in the ps-range, and for the network design discussed here, the neural network’s latency is 20	ps. 

Larger networks will have a linear-path-length longer latency, whilst the standard deviation in pulse 

arrival times will increase with the number of neurons due to the greater number of routes that photons 

can take through the network. Nonetheless, the intrinsic speed of the NLAF result in latencies at least 

three  orders  of  magnitude  lower  than  equivalently  size  electrical  solid-state  neural  network 

implantations.   

Discussion 

 
 
 
Emerging neural network accelerators should be benchmarked against exciting solutions. Comparing 

the  scaling  vectors  of  an  electronic  accelerator  (e.g.  GPU3)  with  recent  developments  of  photonic-

electronic-hybrid neural networks5 to the all-photonic deep neural network discussed in this work, we 

find the following insights (Table 1): (1) the performance gains from an electronic accelerator stem 

from the fact that they do not require any domain crossings (e.g. optic-to-electronic-to-optic, OEO; or 

digital to analog) and are able to operate at a high bit precision. Its power- and delay limitation are 

typically determined by communication and memory access bottlenecks. (2) Photonic-electronic hybrid 

systems (e.g. Ref [5]), on the other hand, offer rapid optical MAC operation performing the linear MVM 

with a lower bit resolution (given by the DAC/ADC), but are limited by electronic-to-photonic crossings 

to perform the NLAF in electrical circuits. Hence, the delay gain from PICs is traded in for performing 

the required NLAF of deep neural networks. Thus, implementations only process only a single a layer 

of  the  neural  network  at  a  time  (or  portions  of  that  layer  depending  on  the  input  vector  length  and 

available photonic hardware) using the available photonic accelerator iteratively, thus sacrificing run-

time. Power consumption wise, these hybrids are limited by the laser, the OEO conversions, and to 

program  the  weights  into  the  photonic  chip  requiring  both  DACs  and  drivers  for  the  electro-optic 

components (e.g. modulators or phase-shifters). (3) All-optical neural networks, in contrast, preserve 

the networks’ depth and keep the to-be-processed input signal in the optical domain across multiple 

layers  for  neural  network,  until  the  final  layer  where  the  OE  conversion  occurs  using  high-speed 

photodetectors. The bit-resolution is not limited by DACs but by setting the memory bit-level, while 

power consumption is constrained by the optical NLAF. Since updates for the weights of the NN are 

available only rarely (i.e. training is time consuming and new training data sets are often a safe-guarded 

trade-secret, such as the ‘valuable’ customer data), storing the weights in nonvolatile memory is logical, 

thus preserving power. That is, consider the alternative; the weights are realized in photonic NNs with 

electro-optic  (EO)  components  (phase  shifters,  or modulator-like  devices).  Since  these  photonic  EO 

components do no retain their state (volatile), one has to read the weight state from a memory on an on-

going basis. Such data-fetching from an off-chip memory (DRAM), or even from an on-chip SRAM is 

rather  time  and  power  costly,  and  requires  use  of  very  power-hungry  DACs.  A  solution  for  this 

challenge  is  to  deploy  the  PCMs  as  nonvolatile  memory,  thus  enabling  for  near  zero-static  power 

consumption,  once  the  weights  are  programmed.  Note,  that  a  bit-resolution  of  4-6  is  sufficient  to 

perform inference tasks adequately and preserves power, a strategy that is also pursued in electronic 

machine learning accelerators such as the NVIDIA T4 system, for example. From a fabrication and 

hence  system  cost  point-of-view,  the  ability  to  utilize  PCM-based  materials  for  both  the  linear  and 

nonlinearoptical algebra allows for reduced complexity and offering synergies. Considering that our 

neural  network  comprises  1100  activation  function  modules,  the  energy  consumption  of  the  entire 

network for performing inference would be just 0.1µJ. All the activation functions can be triggered at 

unison using a passive laser beam spatially patterned, using a digital micromirror array, according the 

network topology. However, an experimental implementation of the entire network would require the 

fabrication  of  a  relatively  large  number  of  neurons,  which  might  require  repeaters  for  boosting  the 

optical signal.

Table  1.  Conceptual  system  comparison  of  photonic,  electronic-photonic  hybrid  neural  network 
accelerators  to  electronic  systems  (i.e.  GPU).  An  all-optical  (AO)  photonic  chip-integrated  neural 
network (NN) offers to realize deep (DNN) multi-layer architectures avoiding optic-to-electronic-to-
optic (OEO) conversion until the very last layer performed by a photodetector (PD). Key is to realize 
an efficient nonlinear activation function (NLAF) at each layer without OEO delays or signal losses. In 
contrast, electronic-photonic hybrid systems perform the multiply algebra photonically, such as via a 
Mach  Zehnder  Interferometer  (MZI)  mesh  network,  and  do  require  an  OEO  conversion  to  add 
nonlinearity electronically at each layer, which adds temporal delay and system overhead, thus limits 
scaling.  Since  updating  weights  from  NNs  is  a  relatively  rare  event,  photonic  machine  learning 
accelerators should make use of PIC-integrated photonic nonvolatile memories, rather than relying on 
off  chip  memory,  which  introduces  both  delay  and  power  overheads  such  as  from  digital to  analog 
converters (DAC).  

We have demonstrated through a combination of simulations and fs transient optical spectroscopy that 

all-chalcogenide  all-photonic  deep  neural  networks  can  be  noise  robust  and  capable  of  performing 

intelligent  tasks  with  high  accuracy.  The  key  to  the  network  accuracy  and  speed  is  the  ability  to 

momentarily  destabilize  the  highly  polarizable  p-orbital  electrons  which  are  delocalized  in  certain 

chalcogenide  crystals,  such  as  GST.  This  results  in  radically  nonlinear  changes  to  the  material’s 

refractive index. A second important material used in this work is the recent report wide bandgap phase 

change material, Sb2S3, used here program the neuron’s weights exemplary with 4-bit resolution. When 

these effects are combined in a photonics on-chip all-photonic neural network architecture, the result is 

a highly accurate system that can be used to identify patterns in optical signals at 10-100 Gbps data 

rates.  This  architecture  is  the  foundation  on  which  all-optical  photonic  neural  networks  can  be 

developed  to  break  the  memory-compute  dichotomy  by  circumventing  unnecessary  electro-optic 

conversions,  and  ultimately  allowing  to  implement  deeper  neural  networks  for  performing  more 

complex inference tasks. 

  
 
 
 
 
From a practical perspective, femtosecond lasers tend to be expensive and bulky. Therefore, we foresee 

that all-optical network implementations find applications in data centres where space and power is less 

important and optical interconnects are commonplace. However, desktop machine learning application 

specific photonic neural network accelerator chips will require compact laser pump sources, such as 

diode  lasers  capable  of  producing  hundred  picoseconds  optical  pulses.  However,  the  electric  field 

generated by such laser pulses is orders of magnitude too low to depopulate resonant bonds in GST. 

However,  many  crystalline  antimony-based  materials  exhibit  nanosecond  duration  highly  nonlinear 

changes to their optical constants when heated with nanosecond laser pulses33. Indeed, a related effect 

has also been reported for electrical Joule heating GST-based electrical phase change memory cells34.. 

We  conclude,  therefore,  that  all-optical  deep  neural  networks  can  be  designed  and  implemented  in 

photonic  integrated  circuits  by  performing  optical  algebra  for  both  the  linear  matrix  vector 

multiplication  operation  but  also  for  the  nonlinearity  required  at  each  layer  of  the  neural  network. 

Summarizing, the main advantages of all-optical photonic NNs is to allow for deep (i.e. multi-layer) 

architectures, short temporal delays just limited by the back-end photodetector, and the weights can be 

stored in photonic memories while ‘passively’ performing the multiply algebra. The only active power 

consumed is related to the external laser source for triggering the volatile transition of the GST film of 

the  NL  modules,  which  are  amortized  across  the  high  data  rate  (e.g.  50-100  Gbps).  The  herein 

introduced  all-optical  deep  neural  network  paradigm  enables  noise-robust  intelligent  in-memory 

computing with potential sub-picosecond latency for inference, which is limited only by the time-of-

flight of the photon and the rapid thermalisation of the GST, but not by phase-transitions. Assuming 

optical  input  signals,  the  network  can  perform  classification  of  the  MNIST  handwritten  digits 

consuming just 0.1µJ of optical energy, which is needed for the nonlinear activation modules. Optical 

neural networks that bypass electro-optic conversion altogether hold promise for network-edge machine 

learning applications where  decision-making in real-time are critical, such as for autonomous vehicles, 

or navigation  systems including LIDAR, but also as machine learning accelerators.     

Materials and Methods 
Waveguide Modelling and Design. An eigenmode solver within Comsol Multiphysics was used to find 
the widths of the HW waveguide, which is tuned to obtain the same effective refractive index as that of 
the single-mode SW when the Sb2S3 is in the amorphous state, so the phase matching condition (cross-
state) is satisfied for the 100% amorphous layer (Fig. S1). In this configuration, the HW width is 420 
-𝑛eff,2342567 −
nm,  which  is  80  nm  thinner  than  the  monomodal  SW.  A  coupling  length  was  of 
𝑛eff,234256,9~14µm was found to be optimal, where 𝑛eff,2342:567,, are the effective refractive indices of 
the  super-modes  of  the  2-waveguide  system  (odd  and  even)  at 𝜆; = 800 nm.  The  gap  between  the 
waveguides found to be 120 nm (Fig. 2b).

Sputtering. A 50.8 mm diameter 99.9% pure GST target was used to sputter the GST films in an Argon 
environment using the AJA ORION 5 sputtering system. The RF power was 30 W and the deposition 
pressure was 0.5 Pa, which resulted in a deposition rate of 0.093 Å/s. The deposition rate was calibrated 
using step profilometry of films deposited for a fixed time.  

 
 
 
Crystallisation. The crystalline GST (c-GST) film was prepared in a two-step process; amorphous GST 
was first deposited on a quartz (SiO2) substrate using radio frequency magnetron sputtering. The sample 
was  then  annealed  at  183 ℃ for  30  minutes  in  a  4  sccm  flowing  argon  atmosphere.  This induced  a 
structural  phase  transition  from  amorphous  to  the  cubic  crystalline  state.  The  phase  transition 
temperature is observed as an abrupt change in optical reflectivity when the material is heated.35 Details 
of the sputtering conditions and how the crystallization temperature was determined can be found in the 
methods  section.  To  determine  the  phase  transition  temperature,  we  recorded  the  change  in  optical 
reflectivity as we heat the material. The as-deposited amorphous GST thin film was heated to 250 ℃, 
at a heating rate of 5 ℃/min, and with an Ar gas flow rate of 4 sccm. The material reflectivity was 
recorded each time the heating stage temperature increase by 1 ℃. To ensure consistency, this sample 
was from the same sputtering batch as the sample in Fig. 3 of the main text.  The inset of Fig. 3f shows 
the  change  in  optical  reflectivity  as  the  temperature  increases;  with the main  figure  focusing  on the 
region where the abrupt change in optical reflectivity occurred. This abrupt change corresponds to the 
structural phase transition from amorphous to face-centred cubic (FCC).35  

We then differentiate the fitted reflectivity curve in Fig. 3f. The maximum point of the differential curve 
is the phase transition temperature. The fitted reflectivity curve, shown in equation (1), was used to 
simplify the differentiation operation. Least- squares fitting was used to determine the coefficients of 
(1). From Fig. 3f, we observe that the equation fits well with the data points. This was also reflected in 
the goodness of fit indicator, 𝑅,, which gave a value of 0.9998. The coefficient values of equation (1) 
can be found in Table 1 of supporting information.

solely used to simplify the differentiation operation. The differential of figure M1 (a) is shown in Fig. 
S1 in the supplementary material. We observe that the phase transition temperature is approximately 
176 ℃. To ensure that the material is fully crystallised, we heat the sample at 183 ℃ for 30 minutes. 

Time-resolved experiments and retrieval of the dielectric function: 
The transient optical measurements were performed using a commercial regenerative 5KHz Ti:Saphire 
amplifier (Coherent) that generated the pump pulse (800 nm) and pumped a commercial OPA (Light 
conversion  TOPAS) to generate the probe pulse (1500 nm). A mechanical chopper at 500Hz was used 
to  modulate  the  pump  and  the  changes  in  reflectance  ΔR/R  (t)  and  in  transmittance  ΔT/T  (t)  were 
simultaneously recorded using two InGaAs detectors. The changes in the optical constant (refractive 
index n and dielectric function) were estimated using a procedure previously reported36. In brief, the 
changes in transmission T(n’,d, λ)/T(no,d,λ)-1 and reflection R(n’,d, λ)/R(no,d, λ)-1  for the multilayer 
structure (GST/SiO2 in our case), were calculated using a transfer matrix method at a given wavelength 
λ, thickness d. Multiple reflections in the SiO2 substrate were ignored. no=6.5+1.2i and n’ are the initial 
and perturbed complex refractive indices respectively. These value of n’ that gives the best fit to both 
data sets simultaneously is found at each delay. The effects of small variations in the GST thicknesses 
(24,27 and 30 nm respectively) were found to only give a small error in the retrieved refractive index. 
In order to ensure a uniform excitation area, the pump spot (180x100 um) was significantly bigger than 
the probe.
