Abstract:  Road  traffic  injury  accounts  for  a  substantial  human  and  economic  burden  globally. 
Understanding risk factors contributing to fatal injuries is of paramount importance. In this study, 
we proposed a model that  adopts a  hybrid ensemble  machine  learning classifier structured from 
sequential minimal optimization and decision trees to identify risk factors contributing to fatal road 
injuries.  The  model  was  constructed,  trained,  tested,  and  validated  using  the  Lebanese  Road 
Accidents Platform (LRAP) database of 8482 road crash incidents,  with fatality occurrence as the 
outcome variable. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the influence of multiple factors 
on  fatality  occurrence.  Seven  out  of  the  nine  selected  independent  variables  were  significantly 
associated with fatality occurrence, namely, crash type, injury severity, spatial cluster-ID, and crash 
time (hour). Evidence gained from the model data analysis will be adopted by policymakers and 
key stakeholders to gain insights into major contributing factors associated with fatal road crashes 
and to translate knowledge into safety programs and enhanced road policies.

1. Introduction 

Road  traffic  injury  (RTI)  imposes  a  substantial  human  and  economic  burden  on  countries 
worldwide. More than 1.5 million road users died in 2018 and an additional 50 million were injured 
or  permanently  disabled,  particularly  among  vulnerable  road  users  (i.e.,  pedestrians  and 
motorcyclists)  [1].  Addressing  the  RTI  global  epidemic  is  of  utmost  importance  to  reduce  RTI’s 
associated  morbidity  and  mortality.  Understanding  key  contributing  factors  that  increase  the 
likelihood of sustaining severe and fatal road injury is critical to curtailing the impact of this major 
public health problem. Existing literature examined major intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated 
with  the  increased  risk  of  fatal  road crashes.  Rolison  et  al.  (2018)  assessed  the  human factors  and 
identified drivers’ characteristics (e.g., age, gender, safety measures adopted, risk-taking behavior) 
that influence the severity of crash outcomes [2]. Other studies examined the role of environmental 
factors (e.g., road types, nighttime travel, weather conditions) in amplifying the risk of exposure to 
fatal  road  injuries.  Altwaijri  et  al.  (2011)  investigated  additional  contributing  factors,  including 
excessive speed, single vehicle, wet surface, and dark lighting road conditions [3]. 

Ample research has explored the use of novel methodologies and statistical models to analyze 
and  understand  key  elements  influencing  injury  severity  outcomes  and  the  increased  risk  of  fatal 
injuries. Statistical and regression models, in addition to feature-based artificial intelligent models, 
present a non-traditional alternative and technique employed to examine the multiple variables that 
catalyze the occurrence of road fatalities. These models have been adopted to investigate underlying 
factors that can contribute to preventing or reducing severe and fatal RTI and guide injury preventive 

 
 
 
efforts.  Keall  et al. (2004) and  Zajac  and Ivan (2002) employed the  logit-based model to  detect  the 
impact of  drinking  and driving on the injury severity  outcome [4,5]. Lack of  safety measures  and 
restraint system use (e.g., seat belt and helmet use) were also identified by Bedard et al. (2002) and 
Valent  et  al.  (2002)  as  major  predictors  of  RTI  severity  and  fatality  using  the  multivariate  logistic 
regression models [6,7]. Yau (2004) used the stepwise logistic regression to investigate human and 
environmental  factors  associated  with  severe  injuries  and  demonstrated  that  drivers’  gender  is  a 
predicting human factor while road lighting conditions, geographic district, time of crash, and vehicle 
age  are  environmental  factor  predictors  of  injury  severity  outcome  [8].  Al-Ghamdi  et  al.  (2002) 
adopted a logistic regression model to identify the growing risk of fatal injuries associated with road 
types, such as non-intersection roads compared to intersection roads [9]. The study further explored 
the  use  of  regression  models  to  examine  all  variables  that  significantly  contribute  to  road  crash 
fatalities including speed, running a red light, following too close, wrong way, and failure to yield. 
Tay (2011) presented a multinomial logit model approach to assess pedestrian–vehicle crash severity 
[10]. Abdel-Aty (2004) compared various models to predict crash injury severity levels and concluded 
that driver gender, excess speed, use of a seatbelt, vehicle type, and rural or urban crash location are 
major  factors  affecting  the  crash  injury  severity  level  [11].  Abdel-Aty  (2003)  and  Xie  et  al.  (2009) 
generated ordered probit models and Bayesian ordered probit (BOP) models to analyze the driver’s 
injury  severity  in  road  crashes  [12,13].  El  Tayeb  et  al.  (2015)  applied  association  rules’  mining 
algorithms to examine the effect of multiple crash factors on the severity and fatalities of the road in 
Dubai city, and concluded that male drivers, private vehicles, and the month of December are key 
factors that highly predicted crash outcomes [14]. Bigham (2014) adopted data mining algorithms, 
such as logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART), to underline the influence 
of  human factors  on  escalating  the  severity  of  road  crashes  [15].  Results  revealed  the  effect  of  the 
driver’s  license  possession,  seat  belt  use,  gender  and  age  on  the  severity  of  road  injuries.  Several 
studies  carried  out  in  Turkey  by  Aci  (2018)  and  Akgungor  et  al.  (2009)  designed  and  developed 
severity models using machine learning methods and artificial neural network models to estimate 
the number of road injuries and to assess their severe outcomes; they demonstrated that ‘cloudiness’ 
and ‘high volume of traffic’ were major predictor factors that influence the increased occurrence and 
severity of road crashes in cities [16,17].   

Nevertheless, most regression models have inherited limitations, mainly in the assumption of 
linear  and  nonlinear  relationships  between  the  exploratory  variables  and  the  variable  under 
investigation.  Violation  of  any  of  these  presumed  assumptions  may  deviate  the  analysis  and  risk 
potential analysis errors. The overarching objective of this study was to propose a model that will 
help  us  to  gain  a  deep  understanding  of  key  variables  that  significantly  contribute  to  fatal  road 
injuries. The aim of this study was two-fold: First, to develop a machine learning-based intelligent 
model that can accurately classify and rank variables influencing the occurrence of fatal crashes; and 
secondly, to adopt the proposed machine learning model to investigate the relationship of fatal road 
crashes  with  a  set  of  input  feature  variables.  Using  the  proposed  model,  the  ranking  of  the  input 
feature variables was identified based on their strong association with the occurrence of fatal road 
injuries. Gained knowledge from the model outcome can be used to advance our understanding and 
awareness of major contributing factors associated with fatal crashes and serves as a first step toward 
addressing these critical elements and improving road safety. 

2. Data Description 

The primary source of data used in this study was the national road crash database procured 
from the Lebanese Road Accidents Platform (LRAP). The LRAP database compiles national traffic 
data  by  crowdsourcing  reported  road  crashes  in  Lebanon  from  social  media  consolidated  mainly 
from three credible sources: Traffic Management Authority, Civil Defense, and Lebanese Red Cross, 
intending to study crash characteristics and contributing factors [18]. The database encompasses 8482 
crash records spanning over a 4-year period from February 2015 to February 2019. As the objective 
of our study was to identify the variables that significantly contribute to fatal road injuries, data was 
refined and parsed for the needed information. Nine variables were selected to be included as input 

 
variables  in  this  study  and  one  variable  ‘fatality  occurrence’  was  selected  as  the  output  variables 
(fatal, non-fatal). We obtained the data in digital form and coded the attributes describing the details 
and outcome of each occurring road crash, including the crash date and time (i.e., month, weekday, 
hour),  location,  type  (i.e.,  vehicle,  motorcycle,  truck,  bike,  pedestrian),  road  type  (i.e.,  motorway, 
primary, secondary, tertiary), injury severity level (no apparent injury, minor injury, serious injury), 
and the number of fatalities. To account for the spatial feature of the crash data, K-means clustering 
was applied to all crash events and the cluster ID was recorded as an input variable, ‘Spatial Cluster 
ID’, with values ranging from 1 to 10. Table 1 demonstrates the input and output features selected 
along with their corresponding ranges. Roads’ characteristics were extracted from the Lebanese roads 
shapefile available at Open Street Map.

3. Method 

We designed and developed a machine learning-based model to determine the most influential 

factors associated with the increased risk of fatal injury occurrence. 

3.1. Model Description 

We  developed  the  model  using  a  classifier  ensemble  technique.  Classifier  ensemble  is  a 
combination of various individual classifiers that serve to jointly perform the classification task. In 
the case of diverse individual classifiers (i.e., classifiers disagreeing with each other), their random 
errors will cancel  each other out and will  help to yield correct output decisions [19]. We  built  the 
model based on the hybrid ensemble technique,  which combines  homogenous and heterogeneous 
ensembles  of  classifiers.  A  homogeneous  ensemble  includes  classifiers  of  the  same  type,  while  a 
heterogeneous  ensemble, as  its  name  indicates, incorporates classifiers  of  various types.  Adopting 
homogeneous ensembles may not be the optimal solution, particularly for problems where the ideal 
base classifier is unclear. Hence, the use of a heterogeneous ensemble is recommended to generate a 
better  performance  [20].  Bagging  and  boosting  are  commonly  used  homogeneous  ensemble 
techniques. On the one hand, the bagging technique depicts multiple classifiers that are trained on 
different under-sampled subsets while allowing them to vote on a final decision. Random forest is an 
extension of the bagging technique for decision trees. On the other hand, the boosting technique refers 
to a series of classifiers that are trained on the dataset, with a gradual emphasis on training records 
that  failed  to  be  modelled  properly  by  the  previous  classifier.  Boosting  is  considered  an  ultimate 
approach that reduces the chances of underfitting. 

Voting is a heterogeneous ensemble that functions by creating two or more sub-models;  each 
sub-model generates predictions based on a combination of multiple approaches. Upon calculating 
the mean or the mode of these predictions, each sub-model tends to vote on the ultimate outcome 
that opts to be adopted. The stacking technique is a simple extension of voting ensembles; it dedicates 

 
 
 
a model to learn how to best combine the predictions from the sub-models. A meta-model is adopted 
to best combine the predictions of sub-models. Hence, this technique is often referred to as blending, 
due to its approach of blending various predictions together. 

In this study, we adopted a hybrid combination of heterogeneous and homogeneous ensembles 
through the ensemble of voting sequential minimal optimization (SMO) with bagging of J48 decision 
trees. Voting SMO is performed using averaging probabilities, where each base learner produces a 
classification  with a certain probability. The produced classifications are then averaged out, and a 
new output classification is generated. Bagging of the J48 decision tree is typically adopted as decision 
trees highly rely upon random node splitting. Details about the chosen model are provided in Section 
4.1. 

3.2. Data Pre-Processing   

Prior  to  using  the  LRAP  data  for  modelling,  we  performed  a  data  pre-processing  phase  to 
prepare  the  LRAP  data  for  the  model  learning  and  testing  phase.  In  machine  learning-based 
classification  problems,  data  are  typically  preprocessed  to  eliminate  any  imbalances  that  might 
negatively  affect  model  performance.  Similar  to  any  crash  databases,  our  original  LRAP  data  is 
inherently  biased  and  imbalanced;  the  distribution  of  the  two  fatality  classes  (i.e.,  fatal,  non-fatal 
outcome) was not equally represented in the dataset, with almost 95% of the samples labelled as ‘non-
fatal  road  crashes’  (ratio  1:19)  while  only  5%  are  classified  as  ‘fatal  road  crashes’.  To  deal  with 
imbalanced data and to prepare the data prior to its use for model design and development, one of 
the following two main approaches can be adopted: (i) Use of cost-sensitive learning algorithms or 
(ii) resampling of the dataset. The latter is a more popular approach due mainly to the lack of cost-
sensitive implementations in many learning algorithms [21]. Using appropriate sampling techniques 
is critical to generating a representative sample dataset. The sampling technique is a preprocessing 
phase that should be applied to the training set, with the main condition of preserving the validation 
and test datasets. Resampling the data is performed by either under-sampling of the majority class 
or  by  oversampling  of  the  minority  class.  On  the  one  hand,  under-sampling  produces  a  random 
subset of the  majority class. The main drawback  of  this sampling technique  is  its  potential loss of 
essential data and relevant information inherent in the original dataset. Oversampling, on the other 
hand, can simply be achieved through the production of random copies to oversample the minority 
class, which is referred to as the ‘oversampling technique by replacement’. The main disadvantage 
of the oversampling technique by replacement is the increased risk of data over-fitting as a result of 
generating replicas of existing instances. 

Each sampling technique has its strengths and limitations. While the under-sampling technique 
poses the potential risk of losing information, oversampling increases the sample size and worsens 
the  needed  computational  power.  To  build  upon  the  strengths  of  the  over-  and  under-sampling 
techniques,  we  adopted  a  hybrid  technique  called  the  synthetic  minority  oversampling  technique 
(SMOTE) as an ultimate technique to achieve a better classifier performance. The SMOTE technique, 
initially proposed by Chawla et al. (2012), combines the under-sampling and synthetic oversampling 
approaches  to  enhance  the  model’s  performance.  Synthetic  oversampling  is  an  oversampling 
approach in which the minority class is oversampled by creating synthetic examples rather than by 
replacement [22]. We further adopted the resampling technique on the LRAP data by oversampling 
the minority class 100% using the SMOTE technique for up to five of the nearest neighbors, followed 
by  the  under-sampling  technique  for  the  majority  class.  The  new  distribution  encompasses  83% 
majority classes and  17%  minority  classes.  This split reduces data  imbalance  while preserving  the 
proper distribution of data.   

To develop the model, we divided the LRAP data into three subsets as follows: 20% of the data 
was used for testing, and the remaining 80% was split into training and validation subsets. The test 
dataset was data hidden from the model and used to assess the final performance of a fully developed 
classifier.  The  training  dataset  was  used  to  develop  the  machine-learning  algorithm  and  the 
validation  data  set  was  used  to  estimate  the  model  performance  while  tuning  the  model’s 
hyperparameters. Validation was conducted through the 10-fold cross-validation technique [23]. The 

 
strength of this method resides in its ability to use all observations for both training and validation; 
each observation was used for validation only once. 

3.3. Metrics Evaluation   

To measure and evaluate the performance of the suggested machine learning-based model, we 
adopted several assessment metrics from the existing literature. Firstly, the performance of machine 
learning algorithms is typically evaluated using the predictive accuracy metric shown in Equation 
(1): 

𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 =

(cid:2904)(cid:2900)(cid:2878)(cid:2904)(cid:2898)

, 

(1) 

where TP stands for true positive instances, TN for true negative, FP for false positive instances, and 
FN for false negative instances. Accuracy is a basic metric that might be misleading, and hence more 
complex metrics are used in the international literature, including the precision (Equation (2)), recall 
(Equation (3)), and F1-score (Equation (4)) as a weighted average of precision and recall: 

𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =

(cid:2870)∗(cid:2900)(cid:2928)(cid:2915)(cid:2913)(cid:2919)(cid:2929)(cid:2919)(cid:2925)(cid:2924)∗(cid:2902)(cid:2915)(cid:2913)(cid:2911)(cid:2922)(cid:2922)

.

(4) 

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (also known as AUROC) shows the 
balanced classification ability between the true positive rate and false positive rate, though it lacks a 
suitable  metric  for  datasets  with  highly  imbalanced  variables  [24].  Nevertheless,  the  area  under 
precision/recall  curve  (also  known  as  AUC-PR)  is  particularly  suited  for  imbalanced  datasets  in 
which one class is observed more frequently than the other class. The AUC-PR  curves represent a 
useful alternative to AUROC, particularly when dealing with imbalanced or skewed data sets [25,26].   
Finally, we used Cohen’s Kappa statistic (Equation (5)) to evaluate classifiers with imbalanced 
data. Kappa is a measure of how instances, classified by the machine learning classifier, closely matc 
the data labelled as ground truth, controlling for the accuracy of a random classifier as measured by 
the  expected  accuracy.  The  value  of  Cohen’s  Kappa  metric  ranges from  −1  to  1.  Landis  and  Koch 
(1977) evaluated the performance of a classifier from the value of the Kappa statistic and accordingly 
classified  Kappa  values  as  follows:  [0–0.20]  as  “slight”,  [0.21–0.40]  as  “fair”,  [0.41–0.60]  as 
“moderate”, [0.61–0.80] as “substantial”, and [0.81–1] as “almost perfect” [27]:

where po is the observed agreement and pe is the expected agreement. 

Within the scope of this study, we used the F1-score, AUC-PR, and Cohen’s Kappa statistic as 
evaluation  metrics for  our classifier. The modelling was carried  out  using  the Weka  environment. 
Weka is a well-known open-source toolkit that provides a set of machine learning and pre-processing 
algorithms [28]. 

4. Results 

4.1. Model Development 

The development of the model encompassed two iterations. Initially, as part of iteration 1, we 
built five different models with a single classifier each. Next, in the second iteration, we leveraged 
the power of the ensemble technique to achieve a higher performance using the best two classifiers 
selected from iteration 1. 

Finding  the  best  performing  classifier  was  an  iterative  process.  In  the  first  iteration,  we 
constructed a training  model using a  single classifier. The following five widely  adopted learning 
algorithms were selected to take part in this iteration 1: 

 
Sequential minimal optimization (SMO). 
Random forest. 

1. 
2. 
3.  Artificial neural network (ANN). 
4. 
5.  Naïve Bayes. 

Logistic regression. 

For each of these five candidate algorithms, we trained a model to classify the fatality occurrence 
using the pre-processed dataset, while tuning their hyperparameters to achieve the best performance. 
The metrics discussed in Section 3.3 were used to measure the performance of each developed model. 
Table 2 shows the performance metrics for the five classifiers developed during the first  iteration. 
The best performance was achieved by SMO, followed by random forest.

The ensemble learning discussed in Section 3.1 provides an enhanced classification performance. 
In the second iteration, we tested various ensemble methods for the two best classifiers: SMO and 
random forest. SMO is an improved training algorithm based on support vector machines (SVMs). 
SMO has been proven to provide a huge performance in terms of the needed computation time. As 
its name infers, random forest selects a random subset of the total features. Out of the selected subset, 
the best  split feature is used to split  each node in a  tree. Random  forest, in its very basic essence, 
involves building  several  decision trees.  However,  one  of  the  disadvantages  of  using  the  random 
forest classifier in Weka is its lack of flexibility for tuning hyperparameters. For this reason, we relied 
on bagging J48 decision trees, which provide better flexibility. The J48 decision trees algorithm is ‘a 
landmark decision tree algorithm, the most widely used machine learning workhorse in practice to 
date’ [29]. With the bagging of J48 decision trees, all features are considered for splitting a node. This 
is  reflected  in  Table  3, where the bagging of J48  decision trees  100 times outperforms the random 
forest of 100 trees.

Finally, we identified our best classifier by adopting  a hybrid ensemble  technique: Vote SMO 

with bagging J48 as shown in Table 3. 

4.2. Model Performance   

We used the selected classifiers to test the performance of our suggested model. Table 4 shows 
the classifier performance outcomes on the unseen test set results. Those results are expected to be 
lower than the training and validation results previously reported in Table 3. A Kappa  statistic of 
0.4067 shows that the model is considered a moderate classifier.

0.4067 

An AUC-PR value of 0.368 is acceptable for our data that have a highly skewed class distribution 
since there are areas of the precision–recall curve that are unachievable [30]. Comparing the AUC-PR 
value of 0.386 achieved in our model with imbalanced data of ratio 1:19 (as previously discussed) to 
the reference AUC-PR value of 0.383 with 1:10 skewed data discussed in [30], we can conclude that 
our  model  has  satisfactory  and  effective  early  retrieval  and  thus  is  considered  a  well-performing 
model. In Figure 1, the x-axis represents Recall (defined in Eq. 3 above) while the y-axis represents 
Precision (defined in Eq. 2). The color represents the discrimination threshold value used to get each 
pair (instance) of Recall/Precision point. In other words, Precision-Recall curve is a parametric curve 
of  the  discrimination  threshold.  Each  instance  in  the  curve  has  a  threshold  value  of  class.  If  the 
instance highly belongs to this class, its threshold will be 1 so it will have orange color. 

Given that our data set is skewed and heavily imbalanced, AUC-PR is the most important metric 
to  evaluate model  performance  since it focuses mainly on the positive  class  [31]. Thus, we closely 
analyzed the obtained AUC-PR results. The baseline of the precision–recall curve can be determined 
by the ratio of positives (P) and negatives (N) as defined in Equation (6). For our proposed model, 
the baseline  𝑦  is equal to 0.076. Most of the precision–recall curve shown in Figure 1 is positioned 
above  the  baseline  (0.076),  which  indicates  the  satisfactory  performance  of  the  proposed  model 
according to [31]:

In  Figure  1,  the  x-axis  represents  Recall  (defined  in  Eq.  3  above)  while  the  y-axis  represents 
Precision (defined in Eq. 2). The color represents the discrimination threshold value used to get each 
pair (instance) of Recall/Precision point. In other words, Precision-Recall curve is a parametric curve 
of  the  discrimination  threshold.  Each  instance  in  the  curve  has  a  threshold  value  of  class.  If  the 
instance highly belongs to this class, its threshold will be 1 so it will have orange color. 

 
 
 
4.3. Attribute Evaluation Analysis 

To examine the impact of each input feature and its effect on predicting the output variable (i.e., 
fatality occurrence), we adopted the attribute evaluator technique within the context of our proposed 
model. The rank-based attribute selection method assorts the variables based on their importance in 
predicting the fatality occurrence. The worth of an attribute is calculated by computing the value of 
the Chi-squared statistic with respect to the class.    We selected the Chi-squared statistic as it matches 
the categorical nature of the variables and applied a 10-fold cross-validation to lower the variance in 
the results. We compared the Chi-squared values to a critical threshold Chi-squared value calculated 
based on the assumption of independent variables. A large estimate exceeding the threshold value 
suggests that the input and the output variables are highly correlated. Estimates below the critical 
value imply the absence of correlation between the variables. We performed a sensitivity analysis to 
determine the ranking of the input variables based on their contribution and strong relationship with 
the fatality occurrence. Sensitivity analysis is a technique widely used to evaluate the effect of input 
variables’  uncertainty  on  the  output  variable  as  well  as  to  assess  the  robustness  of  the  proposed 
model. The findings from the sensitivity analysis show that seven out of the nine input variables were 
correlated with the output variable. Figure 2 depicts the variables ranked in increasing order from 
the most correlated variable to the least one along with their corresponding Chi-squared values. The 
impact of  some input  variables,  such  as crash type,  injury severity level,  and  spatial cluster  ID, is 
substantial on the fatality occurrence, as depicted in Figure 2. Whereas, other variables, such as month 
and day of the week, appear to be independent of the increased likelihood of fatal injury occurrence.

the major contributing factors that increase an individual’s likelihood of sustaining a fatal road injury. 
According  to  Figure  2,  the  most  influencing  variables  associated  with  the  increased  likelihood  of 
crash fatality are listed in an ascending ranking:

was the second strongest predictor of fatal road crashes within the crash type category. 
Injury severity level: The severity level variable was a major contributor to fatal crashes.   
Spatial  cluster  ID: Densely  populated  areas  and  the presence  of  major  highway  crossings  proved  to  be 
correlated with increased traffic fatalities.

5. Discussion 

The increase in the frequency and severity of road crashes necessitates the effective analysis and 
abstraction of relevant risk factors associated with fatal road injuries. This study adopted a unique 
methodological approach to propose a model that synthesizes the strengths of multiple data mining 
techniques in order to perform a robust analysis  of the multiple factors associated with fatal road 
injuries. Data mining presents a plausible analytical technique widely adopted in scientific analysis; 
It integrates techniques from multiple disciplines, including database technology, statistics, machine 
learning, and spatial data analysis, to provide a rich analysis and to allow the extraction of valuable 
knowledge  embedded  in  datasets.  Identifying  key  fatal  injury-contributing  factors  constitutes  the 
base for informing road safety policies and designing effective preventive countermeasures. 

The study findings align with existing studies and reveal that ‘crash type’, mainly the ‘vehicle–
pedestrian’  and the ‘truck–motorcycle’  types  were the most significant  factors associated  with  the 
increased  risk  of  road  fatalities.  This  is  evident  as  pedestrians  and  motorcyclists  are  particularly 
vulnerable road users [32]. Studies in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) indicate that 
pedestrians disproportionally account for the majority of road fatalities [1], particularly that a large 
number of individuals commute by walking- the most affordable mode of transportation. With lax 
safety policies and the absence of road infrastructure and regulations (e.g., designated and lighted 
crosswalks, road safety design, and traffic management), many pedestrians are forced to share the 
roads  with  vehicles,  which  places  them  at  a  greater  risk  of  being  hit  or  killed  on  the  road.  Many 
LMICs reported high rates of pedestrians’ fatalities, reaching up to 85% of total road victims [33–37]. 
This is mainly due to pedestrians’ low tolerance to high impact vehicle collisions, often resulting in 
severe  bodily  damage  and  fatal  injuries.  In  some  instances,  pedestrians’  unsafe  behaviors  tend  to 
exacerbate  the  risk  of  fatal  injuries.  According  to  the  Committee  of  Land  Transport  in  the  Global 
Safety Organization [38], safety behaviors, namely the lack of compliance with existing road safety 
regulations and laws (e.g., ignoring traffic signals, crossing midblock), increased pedestrians’ risk of 
injuries. Concerted efforts from multiple entities, including road engineers, law enforcement officers, 
and  non-governmental  agencies,  should  be  mobilized  to  encourage  safe  behaviors  and  increase 
pedestrians’ safety on the roads.   

The ‘truck–motorcycle type’ was the second strongest predictor of fatal road crashes within the 
‘crash type’ category. Given the disproportional size difference between the two transport  modes, 
the risk of fatal injury substantially increases when a truck–motorcycle crash occurs. Moreover, the 
lack of motorcycling infrastructure on many roads imposes a great risk on motorcycle riders [39] as 
motorcycles  are  often  not  visible  to  truck  drivers,  particularly  on  narrow  shared  roads,  at 
intersections, or when the motorcycle is caught in the truck’s blind spot. Another major contributor 
to fatal injuries is when trucks attempt to turn left while motorcycle riders keep travelling straight, 
leading  to  high impact  collisions  and  fatal  injury  [40].  The  implementation  of  sensors  or  assistant 
systems that alert truck drivers of dangerous situations or warn them of blind spot occupancy can 
substantially  prevent  fatal  collisions.  Moreover,  wearing  protective  clothing,  using  helmets,  and 
abiding  with  road  safety  regulations  are  measures  that  considerably  reduce  the  fatality  of  the 
motorcyclists on the road.   

Our analysis demonstrated that the injury severity level is a critical factor in determining  the 
fatality outcome of the road injury. Individuals involved in road crashes with high injury severity 
levels are strongly correlated with death outcomes; road victims with reportedly high injury severity 
scores (i.e., ISS 51–75) suffer from low survival rates compared to victims with a low ISS score of 40 
or less [41]. Several studies confirmed the strong association between fatal road crashes and severe 
head trauma, particularly among pedestrians and motorcyclists [32,42]. Head injuries are considered 
a severe injury, leading to 4–5 times higher risk of road deaths. The reduced fatality of high ISS is 
mostly  attributed  to  the  enhanced  medical  services  provided  at  the  crash  site,  coupled  with 

 
advancement in medical technologies  and treatment at local trauma centers and medical facilities. 
Future  work  should  focus  on  improving  regional  medical  services  and  accessing  these  services 
through mapping fatal road crash sites relative to local emergency centers’ locations. 

Geographic location and environmental factors were also highly associated with fatal crashes 
[43]. This study shows that ‘spatial cluster ID’ was another major contributor to fatal injuries. Fatal 
crashes  mainly  clustered  in  densely  populated  residential  locations  and  in  areas  of  high 
socioeconomic  status  families.  This  clearly  indicates  that  areas  populated  with  families  of  a  high 
socioeconomic status tend to observe a high number of privately owned vehicles and consequently 
an excess volume of traffic. With the increased number of private vehicles possessed per household 
and less reliance on public transport, the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) increases and ultimately the 
probability of fatal road crashes increases.   

Another predictor of road fatality was the ‘hour of road crash’ factor. This finding agrees with 
existing  literature  and  confirms  the  high  correlation  between  early  AM  crash  time  and  fatality 
outcome [7,37]. Crashes mostly happening between 1 and 6 AM result in a disproportionally high 
rate of death compared to crashes occurring during the day [7,37]. According to a study conducted 
in the United Kingdom, injury severity, defined as the number of deadly crashes per 100 crashes, is 
higher during nighttime than daytime [44]. The heightened fatal crashes in the early AM hours are 
mainly  associated  with  multiple  factors,  including  drivers’  fatigue  and  sleepiness,  alcohol 
consumption, and reduced visibility at night, particularly on non-lit roads. Sleepiness and fatigue are 
critical conditions that result in drivers’ diminished cognitive performance and proper risk judgment, 
especially  following  a  long  working  day  [45].  Advanced  technologies  and  sensors  should  be 
embedded in vehicles to help detect the driver’s sleepiness mode and alert the vehicle’s occupant. 
Impaired  driving  regulations  should  be  strictly  enforced  by  government  police.  Placing  radar 
detectors and performing alcohol tests on drivers at late hours would help to mitigate the occurrence 
of fatal injuries. Clear visibility is a major protective factor; the absence of a properly lit road hinders 
drivers’ clear visibility at night and consequently reduces their information processing capabilities 
and slows their reaction time during crashes [44], which translates into longer  stopping distances, 
and increases the severity of crash outcomes. 

The result of the analyses further showed that crashes occurring on a specific day of the week 
are more correlated with fatal outcomes. According to our study, Fridays and Sundays are associated 
with an increased probability of fatal crashes. Fridays and Sundays correspond to the beginning and 
end  of  weekends  in  Lebanon,  with  increased  leisure  travel  and  excessive  traffic  commuting  and 
exiting  main  urban  cities.  Ample  studies  reported  high  rates  of  fatal  road  injuries  occurring  on 
weekends; approximately 38% to 56% of fatal road crashes occur on Fridays to Sundays [34,46,47]. 
Typically, fatal road injuries are more prevalent on weekends, major holidays, and Fridays leading 
to  long  weekends [48].  To curtail  the  number  of  fatal  road  crashes,  strong enforcement  should  be 
rigorously implemented to enhance safety and reduce fatalities on the road. 

Another main contributing factor for fatal road crashes was ‘road type’. Compared to urban and 
rural  roads,  highways  were  specifically  correlated  with  fatal  crashes.  A  number  of  studies 
demonstrated that fatal injuries mostly occur on intercity roads and highways outside of the urban 
setting, leading to an increased frequency and fatalities of road crashes [7,42,49]. This increased crash 
fatalities on highways is due to multiple reasons, mainly road infrastructure, speed limit variation, 
and road lighting conditions. The lack of safety in road design and infrastructure presents additional 
potential  hazards  for  severe  injuries,  including  crashes  occurring  at  sharp  curves,  non-lit 
intersections, and slippery pavement surfaces [50]. 

This  demonstrative  model  has  many  strengths  and  limitations.  One  of  the  major  advantages 
offered by this model is its ability to predict the occurrence of fatal road crashes and to identify the 
interplay  of  several  contributing  elements  that  increase  the  likelihood  of  these  fatal  crashes.  An 
advanced pre-processing technique was first used to account for the dataset’s skewness. The model 
was  developed  based  on  hybrid  ensemble  machine  learning,  which  proved  to  be  highly  accurate. 
This model encountered some limitations. A limited number of variables were not available in the 
dataset, such as sex and alcohol blood level; therefore, an interpretation of the data predictions should 
be considered in light of the many assumptions and the availability of variables in the dataset. Future 

 
research questions remain to be answered, particularly concerning how sensitive the classification is 
to crash parameters. 

6. Conclusions 

This study’s main contribution lies in the proposed methodology that provides insight into the 
design, development, and validation of a demonstrative machine learning-based model in assessing 
the relevance and influence of multiple contributing factors on the desired outcome, adding value to 
the literature of data mining, with applicability to various case studies in many fields and disciplines, 
including  road  safety  and  injury  prevention.  The  proposed  model  employed  a  hybrid  ensemble 
classification technique that combines voting SMO and the bagging of J48 decision trees using the 
LRAP road crash database of 8482 cases. Through validation, the proposed model proved to be an 
effective analytical model that can be adapted to provide effective overall predictions of the multiple 
factors associated with fatal crash occurrence. Findings from this study can be implemented by road 
safety  stakeholders  and  law  enforcement  to  design  tailored  and  injury  prevention-specific 
regulations and safety countermeasures taking into consideration these major contributors to road 
fatalities.  Further  research  warrants  the  analysis  of  additional  road  injury  crashes  to  enhance  the 
model’s  prediction  performance  and  the  accuracy  of  its  estimated  results,  as  well  as  to  reveal 
additional factors that contribute to the increased risk of sustaining fatal road injuries.
