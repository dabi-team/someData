Abstract
As the demand for machine learning–based inference in-
creases in tandem with concerns about privacy, there is a
growing recognition of the need for secure machine learning,
in which secret models can be used to classify private data
without the model or data being leaked. Fully Homomorphic
Encryption (FHE) allows arbitrary computation to be done
over encrypted data, providing an attractive approach to
providing such secure inference. While such computation is
often orders of magnitude slower than its plaintext counter-
part, the ability of FHE cryptosystems to do ciphertext pack-
ing—that is, encrypting an entire vector of plaintexts such
that operations are evaluated elementwise on the vector—
helps ameliorate this overhead, effectively creating a SIMD
architecture where computation can be vectorized for more
efficient evaluation. Most recent research in this area has
targeted regular, easily vectorizable neural network models.
Applying similar techniques to irregular ML models such as
decision forests remains unexplored, due to their complex,
hard-to-vectorize structures.

In this paper we present COPSE, the first system that
exploits ciphertext packing to perform decision-forest infer-
ence. COPSE consists of a staging compiler that automati-
cally restructures and compiles decision forest models down
to a new set of vectorizable primitives for secure inference.
We find that COPSE’s compiled models outperform the state
of the art across a range of decision forest models, often by
more than an order of magnitude, while still scaling well.

1 Introduction
In recent years, there has been substantial interest in secure
machine learning: applications of machine learning where
the “owners” of a model, input data, or even the compu-
tational resources may not be the same entity, and hence
may not want to reveal information to one another. Settings
where these applications are important include banks shar-
ing financial data while complying with financial regulations,

hospitals sharing patient data while adhering to HIPAA, and
users offloading sensitive computation to cloud providers.
There are many ways of implementing secure machine
learning algorithms, with different tradeoffs of efficiency and
privacy. One popular approach, thanks to its generality, is
based on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) [11]. FHE is a
cryptosystem that allows performing homomorphic addition
and multiplication over asymmetrically encrypted cipher-
texts such that when encryptions of integers are homomor-
phically added the resulting ciphertext is the encryption of
their sum, and similarly when the ciphertexts are homorphi-
cally multiplied the result is an encryption of their product.
In other words, the inputs to an addition or multiply can
be encrypted, the operation can be carried out over the en-
crypted data, and the decrypted result will be the same as if
the operation were carried out on plaintext.

FHE is attractive because it is complete: we can structure
arbitrarily complex calculations as an arithmetic circuit con-
sisting of additions and multiplications, and an entity can
carry out these calculations entirely over encrypted data
without ever being trusted to see the actual data. Unfortu-
nately, homomorphic operations over ciphertexts tend to be
orders of magnitude slower than their plaintext counterparts,
and this problem only gets worse when the ciphertext size
increases, which can happen due to a higher multiplicative
depth in the arithmetic circuit or a larger security param-
eter (meaning more-secure encryption). As a result, most
real-world applications tend to produce FHE circuits that are
impractically slow to execute.

The ability of FHE cryptosystems to do ciphertext packing
somewhat mitigates this problem. Ciphertext packing refers
to encrypting a vector of integers into a single ciphertext, so
that operations over that ciphertext correspond to the same
operations elementwise over the vector [5]. If a circuit can
be expressed as computing over such packed ciphertexts, the
total number of homomorphic operations decreases and it
often scales better to larger inputs, both of which result in a
more efficient circuit for the same application. The challenge,
of course, is vectorizing arbitrary computations in this way.

 
 
 
 
 
 
Much recent work in this space has focused on securely
evaluating neural network–based models. Neural nets are an
attractive target for FHE because the core computations of
neural nets are additions and multiplications, and in dense,
feed-forward neural nets, those computations are already
naturally vectorized. Recent work developed approaches
that compile simple neural net specification to optimized
and vectorized FHE implementations [10].

However, neural nets are not the only type of machine
learning model that can benefit from the advantages of secure
computation. For many applications and data sets, especially
those over categorical data, decision forests are better suited
to solving the classification problem than neural nets.

Unfortunately, decision forests are inherently trickier to
map to vectorized FHE than neural nets. The comparisons
performed at each branch in a decision tree (e.g., “is x greater
than 3?”) are harder to express using the basic addition and
multiplication primitives of FHE, especially if the party pro-
viding the comparison (𝑥 > 3?) is different than the party
providing the feature (𝑥). Moreover, traditional evaluation
of decision trees is sequential: “executing” a decision tree
involves walking along a single path in a decision tree corre-
sponding to a sequence of decisions that evaluate to true.

Recently, researchers have shown how to express the com-
putations of a decision tree as a boolean polynomial [1, 3].
These approaches parallelize decision forests (a set of deci-
sion trees) by evaluating the polynomials of each tree inde-
pendently. Nevertheless, these approaches still have limited
scalability, as they evaluate each decision within a single
tree sequentially, and do not exploit the ciphertext-packing,
SIMD capabilities of FHE.

This paper shows how a compiler can restructure decision
forest evaluation to more completely parallelize their eval-
uation and exploit the SIMD capabilities of FHE, providing
scalable, parallel, secure evaluation of decision forests.

1.1 COPSE: Secure Evaluation of Decision Forests
The primitives that a cryptosystem like FHE provides can
be thought of as an instruction set with semantics that guar-
antee noninterference; that is, no sensitive information can
be leaked through publicly measurable outputs. One key as-
pect of FHE’s noninterference guarantee is that it disallows
branching on secret data, instead requiring that all compu-
tations be expressed as combinatorial circuits that must be
fully evaluated regardless of the input. In particular, it guar-
antees resistance to timing side-channel attacks in which an
attacker learns some useful information about a system (such
as the sequence of decisions taken at each branch in a tree) by
measuring execution time or path length on various inputs.
We propose a system called COPSE that leverages these se-
mantics to relax the control flow dependences in traditional
decision forest programs, allowing us to restructure the in-
herently sequential process of decision tree evaluation into
one that maps directly into existing vectorized, efficient FHE

2

primitives. The vectorized evaluation strategy we present
here is in contrast with the traditional polynomial-based
strategy presented by Aloufi et al. [1], which we discuss in
more detail in Section 2.3.3.

The restructured computation consists of four stages: a
comparison step in which all the decision nodes are evalu-
ated (in parallel), a reshaping step in which decisions are
shuffled into a canonical order, a level processing step where
all decisions at a particular depth of the tree are evaluated,
and an aggregation step in which the results from each depth
are combined into a final classification.

COPSE consists of two parts: a compiler, and a runtime.
The compiler translates a trained decision forest model into
a C++ program containing a vector encoding the tree thresh-
olds, and matrices that encode the branching shape. The gen-
erated C++ links against the COPSE runtime, which loads
the model and provides functions to encrypt it, encrypt fea-
ture vectors, and classify encrypted feature vectors using
encrypted models. The runtime uses HElib [12], which pro-
vides a low-level interface for encrypting and decrypting and
homomorphically adding and multiplying ciphertext vectors,
as well as providing basic parallelism capabilities through
NTL (Number Theory Library) [20].

1.2 Summary of contributions
This paper makes the following contributions:

• A vectorizing compiler that translates decision forest

models into efficient FHE operations.

• An analysis of the complexity of the generated FHE
programs, showing that our approach produces low-
depth FHE circuits (allowing them to be evaluated with
relatively low overhead) that efficiently pack compu-
tations (allowing them to be vectorized effectvely).
• A runtime environment built on HElib that encrypts
compiled models and executes secure inference queries.

We generate several synthetic microbenchmarks and show
that while there is a linear relationship between level pro-
cessing time and the number of decisions in the model, some
of the work (such as the comparison step) is done only once
and takes a constant amount of time regardless of the model
size. We also train our own models on several open source
ML datasets and show that not only does our compiler gen-
erate FHE circuits that perform classification several times
faster than previous work, COPSE can also easily scale up
to much larger models by exploiting the parallelism we get
“for free” from this restructuring.

While there are FHE schemes that allow for three distinct
parties (the server, the model owner, and the data owner),
either by using multi-key constructions or by using some
protocol to compute a secret key shared between the data and
model owners, neither option is currently implemented in
HElib (as of version 1.1.0). Therefore, we test our benchmarks
on scenarios in which there are only two real parties: either

key without needing to know the private decryption key.1
[11] In other words, an evaluator can perform computation
on encrypted data to produce an encrypted version of the
result without ever seeing the plaintext data. Decrypting this
encrypted result will yield the same result as if the entire
computation was performed in plaintext. This makes FHE an
attractive option for users to offload computation to servers
without worrying that the computational server will get
access to sensitive data.

2.2.1 Limitations. One major limitation of FHE cryptosys-
tems is the speed. Homomorphic additions and multiplica-
tions over ciphertexts are orders of magnitude slower than
equivalent operations over plaintext [10]. This makes it dif-
ficult to directly translate large computations into an arith-
metic circuit to be evaluated in FHE, because such circuits
often take prohibitively long to execute.

Another limitation we have to deal with in FHE systems
is that every multiplication introduces some noise into the
ciphertext which, when sufficiently accumulated, makes it
impossible to decrypt. Hence, a homomorphic circuit needs
to be designed with multiplicative depth—the maximum num-
ber of multiplications in a dependence chain—in mind to en-
sure that the computation result can be recovered. This is a
problem partially solved by “bootstrapping”, which involves
homomorphically reencrypting a ciphertext to remove the
noise [11]. Bootstrapping is not a perfect solution, however,
as it is an expensive operation that takes a lot of time. We can
attempt to support a higher multiplicative depth in the circuit
before bootstrapping is necessary by increasing the security
parameter2, however this results in larger ciphertexts which
are slower and more expensive to compute over. Thus, when
expressing any reasonably-sized computation in FHE, we
have to optimize against having a high multiplicative depth.

2.2.2 Advantages. FHE schemes create opportunities for
securely computing functions of secret inputs between dis-
trusting parties, as well as for offloading the processing of
secure data to an untrusted server. This is useful in a machine
learning domain, as it is easy to imagine use cases where
one party has trained a model, and they wish to allow others
to make inferences over it without revealing the structure
or details of the model itself (in the case of decision forests,
without revealing the thresholds). Alternatively, we see this
being applicable in a setting where one party has sensitive
data they wish to classify using a third-party model. In the

1Note that fully homomorphic encryption is distinguished from partially
homomorphic encryption in that the latter only supports either addition or
multiplication, while the former supports both.
2The security parameter is a parameter of the encryption scheme that
specifies how many “bits of security” we get by encrypting a ciphertext. In
general, increasing this parameter makes the encryption stronger (harder
to break, a higher maximum multiplicative depth) at the cost of making
computation more expensive.

2 Background
2.1 Decision Forests
A decision tree is a classification model that assigns a class
label to a vector of features by sequentially comparing the
features against various thresholds. Figure 1 shows an exam-
ple of a single decision tree. Inference over a decision tree is
recursive. Leaf nodes of the tree correspond to class labels,
whereas each interior “branch” node specifies a feature and a
threshold. That feature from the vector is compared against
the threshold, and depending on the result of the compari-
son either the left or right child of the tree is evaluated. For
instance, the tree in Figure 1 uses 𝑥 and 𝑦 as its features
and assigns class labels 𝐿0 – 𝐿5. Assuming the left branch is
taken when the decision is false and the right branch is taken
when true, the tree assigns the input feature (𝑥, 𝑦) = (0, 5) to
the class label 𝐿4. A decision forest model consists of several
decision trees over the same feature set in parallel. Infer-
ence over a decision forest usually consists of obtaining a
class label from each individual tree, and then combining
the labels in some way (either by averaging or choosing
the label selected by the plurality of trees, or some other
domain-specific combining function).

2.1.1 Vectorizing. Making inferences over a decision for-
est is an inherently sequential process. Each branch must be
evaluated to determine which of its children to evaluate next;
these serial dependences make it difficult to vectorize the
evaluation of a single tree. Such dependences do not exist
within individual trees of a forest; However, the nonuniform
branching and depth of each tree makes them unsuitable for
directly packing into vectors for evaluation. [19]

2.2 Fully Homomorphic Encryption
Fully Homomorphic Encryption, or FHE, is an asymmetric
encryption scheme which allows computation to be carried
out over ciphertexts that are encrypted under the same public

most general scenario, and perhaps the one with widest ap-
plicability, we have one party with sensitive data and another
with a sensitive model, both of which can be offloaded to an
untrusted third party server for inference without revealing
details about the data or the model to the other party.

The feature of FHE schemes that we will make the most
use of is the notion of ciphertext packing.[4] This refers to
encrypting an entire vector of plaintext values into a sin-
gle ciphertext in such a way that homomorphic additions
and multiplications over the ciphertext correspond to ele-
mentwise additions and multiplications over the plaintext
vector. This effectively gives us a SIMD (single instruction
multiple data) architecture to target, where the vector widths
are much larger than they typically are for physical SIMD
architectures. This means that if we are careful about our
data representation, we can leverage the ability to pack data
into vectors in order to mitigate the high runtime costs of
working with encrypted data.

2.2.3 Non-interference. Fundamental to the secure com-
putation is non-interference. The contents of private data
should not “leak” and produce outputs (data or behavior)
observable by other parties. One vector of leakage is through
conditional execution: if the result of a branch is dependent
on private data, an observer may gain information by observ-
ing the resulting execution of the program (e.g., if different
paths through the program take different amounts of time).
A common method to prevent this leakage, enforced by
approaches such as FHE, is branchless programming. Rather
than evaluating a conditional and taking a branch, both paths
of a conditional expression are evaluated, and some homo-
morphic computation is performed to produce the desired
result (for instance, multiplying the return values of each
path by a boolean ciphertext to select the right result).

This execution strategy seems like it presents a problem
for decision forests. The standard sequential algorithm for
evaluating a decision tree inherently evaluates a number
of conditional branches to select the final label. The FHE
evaluation strategy effectively requires us to “pad out” the
execution by evaluating every branch of the tree, and only
selecting the final label at the end. The key insight of our
paper is that this seeming limitation affords an opportunity:
parallel evaluation.

2.3 Related Work
Related work in this area falls broadly into three categories:
making the inference process over decision forest models
secure, vectorizing the evaluation of such models, and vector-
izing secure inference over general machine learning models.

2.3.1 Securely evaluating decision trees. The two main
approaches to securely performing inference on decision for-
est models are oblivious transfer (OT) based methods such as
the one found in Wu et al. [21], and constructing polynomial
representations of the trees as seen in Aloufi et al. [1] and

Bost et al. [3]. The OT approach involves using rounds of
oblivious transfer to allow the client to interactively select
a path through the forest without revealing details about
this path to the evaluator. The polynomial-based methods
represent each tree as a boolean polynomial, where each
decision node is a variable, each label node corresponds to a
term in the polynomial, and the boolean decisions multiplied
together in each term encode the path from the root of the
tree to the label.

Wu et al. [21] use additive homomorphism to interactively
compute each decision result between the server and the
client. The client then decrypts these decision results and
uses them as the input to a round of oblivious transfer (OT)
with the server, which results in the client learning only
the final class label, and the server not learning anything
about the decision results. To hide the tree structure from the
client, the server first adds dummy nodes to the tree and then
randomly permutes the branches. This evaluation protocol
relies on the model being available in plaintext to the server,
which is a restriction we overcome by providing a way to
represent the model as a series of ciphertexts, allowing its
structure to be hidden from both the client and the server.
Bost et al. [3] and Aloufi et al. [1] structure the tree as
a vector of boolean polynomials in the comparison results,
each returning a single bit of the class label. For example, for
a decision tree with a single branch 𝑑0, and 𝐿0 and 𝐿1 as the
true and false labels respectively, the 𝑖𝑡ℎ polynomial would
look like 𝑝𝑖 (𝑑0) = 𝑑0𝐿𝑖
0 + (1 − 𝑑0)𝐿𝑖
𝑗 denotes the
𝑖𝑡ℎ bit of the 𝑗𝑡ℎ label). The multiplications in each term are
evaluated recursively in pairs to give a multiplicative depth
that is logarithmic in the order of the polynomial instead of
linear. Since the polynomials for each bit are over the same
decision results, they are packed into SIMD slots so that each
SIMD operation works over all the bits in parallel. There is
no SIMD capability beyond this, as every decision node in
the tree is still evaluated sequentially. This is different from
our technique, which exploits SIMD parallelism between un-
related sets of decision nodes. Since the number of decision
nodes in a forest is roughly exponential in the number of bits
in the class labels, we expect our technique to scale better to
larger models.

2.3.2 Evaluating vectorized decision forests. Some work
has been done in the area of vectorizing the evaluation of
decision forests. Ren et al. [19] lay out each tree regularly
in contiguous memory to turn the control dependence of
each branch into a data dependence. They propose a protocol
to evaluate a vector of decision nodes and produce a new
vector of the results. Since there are no control dependencies
anymore, each tree in the forest can be packed into a single
SIMD slot, allowing for vecotorized evaluation of the entire
forest. While this method results in evaluating the entire for-
est top-down without much extra work, it does not directly
work for our case. At each step, all the current nodes are

4

evaluated and produce the index in continguous memory of
the next node to evaluate. This requires random-access to
the memory where the nodes of the tree are stored, which is
not possible to implement efficiently in an FHE setting.

2.3.3 Vectorized inference. Dathathri et al. [10] propose
CHET, a compiler for homomorphic tensor programs. CHET
analyzes input tensor programs such as neural network in-
ference, and determines an optimal set of encryption pa-
rameters, as well as the most efficient data layout for easily
vectorizing the computation. Although CHET improves per-
formance with regular data structures like tensors, it is not
build to deal with fundamentally irregular programs like de-
cision forests. The COPSE compiler handles this irregularity
by severing the dependences within each tree and producing
easily vectorized structures.

3 Overview
This section gives a high level overview of the vectorizable
decision forest evaluation algorithm before diving into the
details. We will use the decision tree in Figure 1 as a running
example to illustrate these steps.

3.1 The Players
The algorithm deals with three abstract entities: the model
owner (Maurice), the data owner (Diane), and the server that
performs the computation (Sally). These could correspond to
different physical parties who want to conceal information
from each other, or multiple entities could map to the same
physical party (for example, the same party could own the
model and the server). Section 7 discusses the security impli-
cations of different configurations. The three entities each
own different components of the system, and work together
to evaluate a decision forest for a set of features.

1. Maurice owns a decision forest model for which the
features and labels are public, but he wants to keep the
shapes of the trees and their threshold values secret
2. Diane owns several feature vectors that she wants to

classify using the model owned by Maurice

3. Sally owns no data but possesses computational power
and allows Maurice and Diane to offload their compu-
tations to her.

3.2 The Workflow
Figure 2 shows a high level overview of the COPSE work-
flow. The COPSE system consists of two main components:
a compiler used by Maurice, and a runtime used by Sally.

Once Maurice has trained a decision forest model, he uses
the COPSE compiler to generate an encrypted and vector-
ized representation that he can send to Sally, who can then
accept inference queries, and use the COPSE evaluation al-
gorithm (summarized next) to make classifications. When
Diane wants to make a query, she first encrypts her features
and then sends them to Sally, who uses the COPSE runtime

ponents and data are Maurice’s responsibility. Red compo-
nents are Sally’s. Green components are Diane’s. Shaded
boxes represent encrypted data.

to classify them against Maurice’s encrypted model. Sally
then sends the encrypted classification result back to Di-
ane, who can then decrypt it and send additional inference
queries to the model if she wishes.

3.3 The Evaluation Algorithm
The multi-party evaluation algorithm proceeds in the follow-
ing steps:

Step 0: Features. First, Maurice reveals the maximum
multiplicity of any feature in a tree of the model to Sally,
who then reveals it to Diane to enable the latter to set up an
inference query. In the example in Figure 1, this is 3, which
corresponds to the feature 𝑦, as it shows up in 𝑑0, 𝑑2, and
𝑑4, whereas 𝑥 only shows up in 𝑑1 and 𝑑3 (and hence has a
multiplicity of 2). Diane then replicates each feature in her
feature vector a number of times equal to this maximum
multiplicity (for instance, yielding [𝑥, 𝑥, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑦, 𝑦]), encrypts
the replicated vector, and sends it to Sally.

Step 1: Comparison. Maurice uses the COPSE compiler
to construct a vector containing all the thresholds in the
tree, grouping together thresholds from decision nodes that
use the same feature. This threshold vector is padded with a
sentinel value 𝑆, as shown in Figure 3a, for when a feature has
less than the maximum multiplicity, so that the threshold
vector, representing the decision nodes in the forest, and
Diane’s feature vector are in one-to-one correspondence.
Once this threshold vector is constructed, Maurice sends it
to Sally. To perform inference, Sally pairwise compares the
vector to Diane’s encrypted feature vector to get the results
of every threshold comparison, as illustrated in Figure 3b.
Each element in the decision result vector is either a sentinel
or corresponds to one of the decision nodes in the original
tree. Note that this thresholding happens in a single parallel
step regardless of the number of branches in the tree, as both
Diane’s features and the decision tree thresholds are packed
into vectors.

Step 2: Reordering. Once Sally produces the decision vec-
tor, as in Figure 3b, she reorders all the branch decisions so
they correspond to a pre-order walk of the tree, and removes
the sentinel values.

Step 3: Level Processing. Now that the decision results
are in a canonical order, each level (counting up from the
leaves) can be processed separately. At each level of the
tree, Sally construct a binary mask encoding for each label
whether it is downstream of the true or false branch at that
level. Figure 4 shows how Sally processes levels 1 and 2.
The nodes colored in blue are the nodes at that level, while
the labels colored in green correspond to a 1 in the mask
and are downstream of the “false” branch, and those in red
correspond to a 0 in the mask and are downstream of the
“true” branch. Note that 𝑑4 is treated as part of level 1 and 2.
This is because labels 𝐿4 and 𝐿5 are shallower than the other
labels. Hence, 𝑑4 is treated as though it exists at its own level
as well as all lower levels.

Consider Level 1. Labels 𝐿0, 𝐿2, and 𝐿4 correspond to the
‘false’ branch for these decisions, and labels 𝐿1, 𝐿3, and 𝐿5
correspond to the ‘true’ branch. The decision results corre-
sponding to that level are picked out of the vector from step
2 and XOR’ed with the mask to yield a boolean vector encod-
ing whether each label could possibly be the classification
result given the decision results at that level (in other words,
for the 𝑖𝑡ℎ label to be possible, the 𝑖𝑡ℎ entry in the XOR’ed
vector must be true).

Step 4: Accumulation. Finally, once these vectors are
collected for each level, Sally simply multiplies them all to-
gether to get a final label mask. As illustrated in Figure 5,
an entry in this final vector is true if all the corresponding
entries from the XOR’ed level vectors were true; this can
only be true when the corresponding label is, in fact, the
result returned by the decision tree. Note that the return
value of the evaluation algorithm is not a single label but
rather an 𝑁 -hot bitvector with a single bit turned on for each

(b) Processing at level 2
Figure 4. Each level is processed individually

Figure 5. Level vectors are multiplied to yield the final result

tree. Section 4 discusses the reasoning behind this design
choice, and Section 7.1 addresses the privacy implications.

A key point to notice about this algorithm is its inher-
ent parallelizability, as each level can be processed entirely
independently of the others. Another advantage is that all
the computation at a given level can be packed into vector-
ized operations, as discussed in Section 2.2.2, which exposes
even more algorithm-level parallelism. Finally, since all these
steps are performed on encrypted data using FHE, nothing
about the model is revealed to Diane or Sally aside from
the maximum multiplicity, and nothing about the Diane’s
feature vector is revealed to anybody. Section 4 formalizes
and describes in greater detail the exact primitives used to
carry out this algorithm, and Section 7 informally discusses
how configuring the FHE primitives in different ways yields
different security properties.

4 Vectorizable Evaluation Algorithm
4.1 Preliminaries

4.1.1 Definitions and Important Properties.

Decision Forest: Consider a decision forest model 𝑀 con-
sisting of trees 𝑇1, . . . ,𝑇𝑁 . Each tree 𝑇𝑖 consists of a set of
branches 𝐵𝑖 (the interior nodes) and a sequence of labels 𝐿𝑖
(the leaves). The labels in the sequence do not necessary have
to be unique. We index all the branches in a tree by enumer-
ating them in preorder; this indexing can be easily extended

6

to the entire forest by not starting the count over for each
new tree. The labels of the forest are similarly (separately)
indexed.

All the data of a decision forest except for its branch-
ing structure is encoded in three vectors: x, f, and t. Let
x = (𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛) be the set of features. Then f is the vector
encoding which feature is compared against at each branch,
and t is the threshold at each branch. For instance, if the
branch 𝐵7 has the condition 𝑥3 < 100, then 𝑓7 = 3 and
𝑡7 = 100.

Properties of nodes: Each node in the tree has a level,
which is the number of branches on the longest path from the
node to a label (including itself; the level of a label node is 0),
a downstream set, which is the set of all labels reachable from
this node, and a width which is the size of the downstream
set. An important consequence of these definitions is that,
given a level 𝑑 and a label 𝐿𝑖 , there is a unique branch node
𝐵 𝑗 at level 𝑑 that has 𝐿𝑖 in its downstream set. To see why
this is the case, consider two distinct nodes 𝐵 𝑗 and 𝐵𝑘 that
contain 𝐿𝑖 in their downstream set. One of the two must be
an ancestor of the other, since each node has a unique parent;
thus, they cannot have the same level.

Properties of models: We define the multiplicity 𝜅𝑖 of a
feature 𝑥𝑖 to be the total number of times it appears in the
model (in other words, 𝜅𝑖 is the number of times 𝑖 appears
in the vector f). In the example tree in Figure 1, 𝜅𝑥 = 2
and 𝜅𝑦 = 3. The maximum multiplicity 𝐾 of a forest is the
maximum multiplicity of all its features (for the example
tree, 𝐾 = 3).

The branching 𝑏 of a model is the total number of branch
nodes it has; this is equivalent to the sum of the multiplicities
for each feature, which in the example is 𝑏 = 𝜅𝑥 +𝜅𝑦 = 2+3 =
5. The quantized branching 𝑞 is the product of the 𝐾 and the
total number of features; in other words, it is the branching
if every feature had maximum multiplicity. In the example,
since 𝐾 = 3 and there are two features, 𝑞 = 6.

securely perform bit operations on floating point numbers,
we instead represent decision thresholds as fixed-point val-
ues with the precision 𝑝 known at compile-time. A vector of
𝑘 fixed-point values with precision 𝑝 is represented with 𝑝
bitvectors each of length 𝑘, with vector 𝑖 holding the 𝑖𝑡ℎ bit
of each element of the original vector. This peculiar “trans-
posed” representation makes vectorizing computations eas-
ier later, allowing us to treat each bit independently while
still performing comparisons in parallel.

Integer Comparison. We use the SecComp algorithm de-
scribed by Aloufi et al. [1]. Each “bit” of the values being com-
pared is actually a bitvector packed as described above. The

7

SecComp algorithm compares two equal-length bitstrings 𝑥
and 𝑦 lexicographically.

Matrix Representation. Matrices are represented as vec-
tors of generalized diagonals. The 𝑖𝑡ℎ generalized diagonal 𝑑𝑖
of an 𝑚 × 𝑛 matrix 𝐴 is a vector defined as follows:

𝑑𝑖 = (𝐴0,𝑖, 𝐴1,𝑖+1, . . . , 𝐴𝑛−𝑖,𝑛, 𝐴𝑛−𝑖+1,0, . . . , 𝐴𝑚,(𝑚+𝑖)mod 𝑛)
Intuitively, this is the diagonal with an offset of 𝑖 columns,
wrapping around to the first column when necessary. For an
𝑚 × 𝑛 matrix there are always 𝑛 generalized diagonals, each
of which has length 𝑚.

Matrix Multiplication. The diagonal representation de-
scribed above makes matrix/vector multiplication easier. To
multipliy an 𝑚 × 𝑛 matrix 𝑀 by an 𝑛 × 1 vector 𝑣, we use
the algorithm described by Halevi and Shoup [13]. The 𝑖𝑡ℎ
diagonal of 𝑀 is multiplied component-wise by the vector 𝑣
rotated 𝑖 slots. When 𝑚 ≠ 𝑛, the width of these two vectors
will not be the same. If 𝑚 > 𝑛, 𝑣 is cyclically extended (e.g.
[𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧] becomes [𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧, . . . ]). If 𝑛 > 𝑚, 𝑣 is truncated
after rotating. The vectors resulting from each such product
are summed. This has the advantage of having a constant
multiplicative depth of 1 regardless of the size of the matrix
or vector.

Classification Result. The classification result is encoded
into a bitvector with one slot for every label node in the for-
est. A slot in the bitvector holds a 1 if the corresponding
label was the one chosen by its tree, and a 0 otherwise; in a
forest with 𝑁 trees, 𝑁 slots in the bitvector will be set to 1.
Note that this approach to generating the results yields
the classification decision of each component decision tree,
rather than just the plurality classification. COPSE chooses
the former approach as one point in the tradeoff space be-
tween efficiency and privacy, as discussed in Section 7.2.

4.2 Algorithmic Primitives
4.2.1 Padded Threshold Vector. To carry out the com-
parisons in parallel, all the decision thresholds in the forest
need to be packed into a single vector that is in one-to-one
correspondence with Diane’s feature vector. This packed
threshold vector is actually a sequence of 𝑝 bitvectors packed
according to the description in Section 4.1.2, where 𝑝 is the
chosen fixedpoint precision (the 𝑖𝑡ℎ bitvector contains the
𝑖𝑡ℎ bit of each threshold). To prevent Diane from learning
the exact structure of the decisions (i.e. which feature is
thresholded against at each node of the forest), we group
the thresholds in the vector by the feature they correspond
to (so all the 𝑥1’s go at the beginning, followed by the 𝑥2’s,
and so on). Revealing some information about how many
times each feature is in the forest (in other words, 𝜅𝑖 ) is, of
course, unavoidable. We limit the scope of this information
leak by only revealing the maximum multiplicity 𝐾 of all the
features; for any feature with fewer than 𝐾 occurences, the

threshold vector is padded with some sentinel value 𝑆 until
its effective multiplicity is 𝐾. Our implementation chooses
𝑆 = 0, but the exact value does not matter as the results from
comparisons against a sentinel are removed later anyway.

4.2.2 Reshuffling Matrix. Once a boolean vector is pro-
duced containing the decision result for each node of the
forest, it must be rearranged to correspond to the order of
the branch enumeration. This also means removing the slots
in the vector resulting from comparing against one of the
sentinels used to pad the thresholds. In order to encode this
reshuffling and sentinel removal, we construct a binary ma-
trix R that, when multiplied by the decision result vector,
produces a new vector with the results sorted correctly. The
matrix R has a 1 in row 𝑖 and column 𝑗 if the 𝑗𝑡ℎ element of
the padded threshold vector corresponds to the 𝑖𝑡ℎ branch
of the decision tree. This means that there is exactly one of
these in every row of R, and at most one in every column,
with the empty columns corresponding to the indices of the
sentinel values.

4.2.3 Level Matrices. A level matrix is constructed for
each level of the forest up to its maximum depth. For each
label, the matrix at a given level selects the branch node
above the label at that level. In the case where there is no
such branch (for instance, there are branches above 𝐿4 at
level 1 and level 3, but none at level 2 in the example in
Figure 1), the highest branch not exceeding that level is
selected (this is 𝑑4). The decision to do this is somewhat
arbitrary; we could have just as easily chosen to use a higher
level branch (such as 𝑑0) instead, since what really matters is
that every branch is represented in at least one of the levels.
The level matrices are, like the reshuffling matrix, boolean
matrices. A level matrix has a 1 in row 𝑖 and column 𝑗 if the
branch node with index 𝑗 is the one above the label node
with index 𝑖 at that particular level (or when no such branch
exists, if it is the chosen replacement). Each row of the matrix
has exactly one, and the number each column has is equal
to the width of the corresponding branch.

4.2.4 Level Masks. For each level matrix there is a cor-
responding “mask”, which is a boolean vector that encodes
whether each label is on the “true” or “false” path from that
level. For each label, we look at the corresponding branch
above it (the same one determined by the level matrix). If the
label is under the “true” path of that branch, we put a 0 in
the corresponding slot of the mask vector; otherwise, we put
a 1. Thus, given a vector of decision results for the branches
above each label, XOR’ing this vector with the “mask” yields
a new vector which has a 1 for any label that could be chosen
by the decision result at that level. This means that multi-
plying (or AND’ing) together each of these vectors would
result in a 1 only for the labels that each tree outputs.

4.3 Algorithm
The actual inference algorithm is implemented as vector-
ized computations using these structures. The overall flow
is shown in Algorithm 1. First, the SecComp [1] primitive
is applied to Diane’s feature vector (Feats) and the padded
threshold vector from Maurice’s model (Thresh), which pro-
duces a boolean vector of decision results and sentinels. This
vector is multiplied by the reshuffling matrix (Reshuf) using
to produce a new boolean vector whose decision results cor-
respond exactly to the branches of the forest in a preorder
enumeration. For each level of the forest, the reshuffled vec-
tor is multiplied by the matrix for that level (Lvls) and then
added to the mask for that level (Masks). Finally, every such
vector is multiplied together to produce a single vector with
a slot for each leaf node in the forest (Labels). This vector is
sent back to Diane for decryption. By expressing the entire
algorithm in terms of these vector operations and matrix
multiplications, we are able to exploit a great degree of par-
allelism, and effectively scale the secure inference process to
larger models.

Our algorithm uses Aloufi et al.’s SecComp [1] and Shoup’s
MatMul [13] as subroutines. The ability to express most of
the computation in terms of MatMul is the key to the algo-
rithm’s vectorizability, since the MatMul routine is itself a
set of parallel vector operations with constant multiplicative
depth. Performing the computation for each level of the tree
at once and then combining them all at the end lets us have
a multiplication circuit that is only logarithmic in the forest
depth, instead of the naive approach with linear depth. Sec-
tion 6 discusses the complexity and multiplicative depth of
both the primitives and the algorithm as a whole in more
detail.

5 Compiler and Runtime
While the evaluation algorithm described above is effective
at vectorizing the inference of a decision forest, it is not
the most natural way in which such models are usually ex-
pressed. A compiler can solve this problem by taking a more
natural representation of a trained model and automatically

8

generating a program that creates these vectorizable struc-
tures and performs the inference algorithm. In this section,
we discuss the implementation details of such a compiler. 3

Input Representation. The input to the compiler is a
serialized trained decision forest model. The format consists
of a line defining the label names as strings, followed by a
line for each tree in the forest. Each leaf node outputs the
index of the label it corresponds to. For every branch node,
the serialized output contains the index of its feature, the
threshold value its compared to, and the serializations of its
left and right subtrees respectively.

Compiler Architecture. COPSE is a staging metacompi-
lation framework. The input to the first stage is a serialized
decision forest model. The COPSE compiler translates this
to a C++ program that uses the vectorizable data structures
described in Section 4.2, specialized to the given model, and
invokes the algorithmic primitives provided by the COPSE
runtime. The generated C++ program is then compiled and
linked against the COPSE runtime library to produce a bi-
nary which can be executed to perform secure inference
queries.

Structuring COPSE as a staging compiler allows us to spe-
cialize the generated C++ code by (1) choosing an appropriate
set of encryption parameters for the model being compiled
and (2) selecting optimal implementations for the algorith-
mic primitives given the FHE protocol and implementation
used by the runtime. In our sensitivity analysis in Section 8,
we performed a sweep over the possible encryption param-
eters and found that for the models we were compiling, a
single set dominated all the others. Since COPSE is currently
targeted only to use the BGV implementation in HElib, a
single set of optimal implementations is used for all the prim-
itives. However, if COPSE were to use a different protocol
and backend (for instance, SEAL and CKKS), these choices
could matter and the staging compiler could appropriately
tune the parameters and implementations.

COPSE Runtime. The runtime has datatypes that rep-
resent both plaintext and ciphertext vectors and matrices,
as well as the parties playing the role of model owner (Mau-
rice), data owner (Diane), and evaluator (Sally). It also exposes
primitives to encrypt and decrypt models and feature vectors,
and securely execute an inference query given an encrypted
model and encrypted feature vector. The programmer can
use these datatypes to encode their application logic, and
then link against the generated C++ code to produce a binary
that securely performs decision forest inference.

We use the HElib library [12] with the BGV protocol [6]
as our framework for homomorphic encryption. This library
provides low-level primitives for encrypting and decrypting

plaintext and ciphertexts, homomorphically adding and mul-
tiplying ciphertexts, and generating public/secret key pairs.
HElib also supports ciphertext packing which gives us the
vectorizing capabilities we need.

6 Complexity Analysis
This section characterizes the complexity of COPSE. This
complexity is parameterized on various parameters of the
decision forest model: the number of branches 𝑏, the total
number of levels 𝑑, the fixedpoint precision 𝑝, and the quan-
tized width 𝑞. (Definitions of these parameters can be found
in Section 4.1.1.) The complexity of FHE circuits is char-
acterized by two elements: (1) the number of each kind of
primitive FHE operation and (2) the multiplicative depth of
the FHE circuit. The former captures the “work” needed to
execute the circuit. The latter, characterized by the longest
dependence chain of multiplications in the circuit, deter-
mines the encryption parameters needed to evaluate the
circuit accurately (higher multiplicative depth requires more
expensive encryption, or bootstrapping).

The FHE operations used to express the amount of work
are: (1) Encrypt, which produces a single ciphertext from a
plaintext bitvector; (2) Rotate, which rotates all the entries
in a vector by a constant number of slots; (3) Add, which
computes the XOR of two encrypted bitvectors; (4) Multiply,
which computes the AND of two encrypted bitvectors, and
(5) Constant Add, which computes the XOR of an encrypted
bitvector with a plaintext one. The Multiply operation incurs
a multiplicative depth of 1, and all the rest incur a multiplica-
tive depth of 0.

Table 1 characterizes the steps of the COPSE algorithm,
in terms of the number of FHE operations and their multi-
plicative depth, as well as the cost of encrypting the data and
models (which do not factor in to multiplicative depth, as
they are separate from the circuit). Table 2 shows the over-
all cost of COPSE, including combining the multiplicative
depths of the individual steps according to their dependences
in the overall circuit. Note that the cost of processing a sin-
gle level is incurred 𝑑 times, but the level processing steps
occur in parallel in the FHE circuit, so altogether the level
processing only contributes 1 to the multiplicative depth.

7 Security Properties
This section describes the various security properties of deci-
sion forest programs built using COPSE. Section 7.1 discusses
information leakage between the parties, while Section 7.2
discusses the privacy implications of different design deci-
sions in COPSE.

7.1 Information Leakage
COPSE has three notional parties: the model owner Maurice,
the data owner Diane, and the server Sally. Maurice owns 𝜏,

Two Physical Parties. FHE is inherently a two-party pro-
tocol, so although the secure inference problem has three
notional parties, our system focuses on the cases where there
are only two physical parties (i.e., two of the notional parties
are actually the same person). There are three scenarios:

10

1. Where 𝑀 = 𝐷; for instance, if the model and data are
owned by the same party, which offloads the inference
to an untrusted server. This is the standard “computa-
tion offloading” model used by most FHE applications
[8–10].

2. Where 𝑀 = 𝑆; if the model is stored on some server
which allows clients to send encrypted data for classi-
fication

3. Where 𝐷 = 𝑆; if the model is trained and sent directly
to a client for inference, but the client must be pre-
vented from reverse-engineering the model.

In Table 3 we describe what data is explicitly revealed
or implicitly leaked to each party. When 𝑀 = 𝐷, obviously
neither party can leak information to the other. However, be-
cause matrices are encrypted as a vector of ciphertexts with
one per column (diagonal), 𝑆 learns the number of columns
in each matrix. This translates to learning the number of
branches 𝑏 from each level matrix L , and learning the quan-
tized width 𝑞 from the reshaping matrix R. Furthermore,
since the level masks and matrices are stored separately, 𝑆
also learns the maximum depth of the forest.

When 𝑆 = 𝑀, neither 𝑆 nor 𝑀 can leak information to
each other. However, 𝑀 must explicitly send the value of 𝐾
to 𝐷 to get feature vectors with the right padding. When the
inference result is sent back, 𝐷 also learns 𝑏 + 1, as it is the
length of the final inference vector.

When 𝑆 = 𝐷, once again neither 𝑆 nor 𝐷 leak information
to each other. However, this time 𝑀 not only reveals 𝐾 and
𝑏 to both 𝑆 and 𝐷 the same way as in case (2), but 𝑞 is also
leaked through the widths of the matrices, as well as 𝑑.

Three Parties. When 𝑆, 𝑀, and 𝐷 are separate physical
parties that do not collude, 𝑀 necessarily leaks to 𝑆 the values
of 𝑏, 𝑞, and 𝑑, as well as revealing 𝐾. 𝑆 then reveals 𝐾 to 𝐷,
and 𝑀 leaks 𝑏 to 𝐷. Even though 𝑀 and 𝐷 use the same
key pair, because neither colludes with 𝑆, neither ever gets
access to the other’s ciphertexts, and privacy between the
two is therefore preserved. However, if one of the parties
does collude with 𝑆, they gain access to the other party’s
ciperhtexts which can then be easily decrypted. Thus in
the case where there is collusion between 𝑀 or 𝐷 and 𝑆,
everything is leaked. Table 4 summarizes these results.

Since it is difficult to convince both 𝑀 and 𝐷 that the
other is not colluding with 𝑆, we see that attempting to run
this protocol with three physical parties using single-key
FHE is unreasonable. There has been a lot of prior work on
multikey FHE schemes [7, 14] and threshold FHE, which
uses secret sharing to extend single-key FHE to work in a
multiparty setting [2]. These schemes act as “wrappers” that
construct a new, joint key pair for FHE (in this case shared
by 𝐷 and 𝑀), and hence can be applied directly to COPSE at
the cost of introducing additional rounds of communication
and additional encryption/decryption steps.

7.2 Security implications of COPSE design
The design of COPSE admits different points in the design
space that trade off security and performance. Here, we dis-
cuss the implications of the design points that we chose.

7.2.1 Feature padding. Choosing to have Diane replicate
and pad her feature vector is a tradeoff we make between
the performance and security of COPSE. To avoid requiring
Diane to do any preprocessing beyond replicating her feature
vector, we would need to explicitly reveal the multiplicity
of each feature used in the model. By requiring the feature
vector to be padded, we only reveal the maximum feature
multiplicity of the model must be explicitly revealed.

We could even avoid revealing the exact maximum multi-
plicity, and instead only reveal an upper bound, simply by
adding several extra sentinel values to each feature in the
threshold vector. The performance overhead of this would be
minimal, except a slightly more expensive matrix multiply
to remove the extra sentinel values (the size of this overhead
scales with how loose the given upper bound is).

To avoid leaking any multiplicity information, we could
also relax the requirement that the Diane replicate her fea-
tures at all, instead accepting a vector that lists each feature
once, and requiring that the server carry out the necessary
replication directly on the ciphertext vector. While this does
prevent Diane from learning anything about feature multi-
plicities in the mode, it has the effect of replacing several
(cheap) plaintext replication operations with their equivalent
ciphertext ones, which are much more expensive.

7.2.2 Returning classification bitvectors. Returning the
bitvector of classification results rather than accumulating
them to return a single label leaks some information about
the structure of the model to Diane.

First, it requires a “codebook” (i.e. a map from each po-
sition in the bitvector to the label it represents) to be re-
vealed to Diane. This reveals the order of the labels in the
constituent trees of the forest (though not the “boundaries”

between the trees). It is possible to avoid leaking the order
of the label nodes by first having the server generate a ran-
dom permutation to apply to the decision result bitvector
(via a plaintext matrix/ciphertext vector multiplication), then
applying the same permutation to the codebook.

Shuffling the codebook still reveals information about the
model structure; in particular, it leaks how many leaf nodes
correspond to each label. For instance, knowing whether a
particular label is output by most of the leaves in the forest
versus only being output by a single leaf potentially reveals
something about how “likely” that label is to be chosen. This
can also be avoided if the server pads both the codebook and
the classification result bitvector with random extra labels
before returning both of them; this step can be folded into
the shuffling step as well, so it has minimal extra cost.

COPSE currently assumes that the codebook is already
known to Diane, and performs neither shuffling nor padding.
Another data leak is the label result chosen by each tree.
In other words, Diane learns that, for instance, two trees
chose 𝑋 and three chose 𝑌 , rather than simply learning that
the final classification is 𝑌 . This is an unavoidable conse-
quence of COPSE’s design of returning a bitvector of results
rather than performing the reduction server-side. The effect
of this design is to put the burden of accumulating all the
chosen labels into a single classification on Diane. Doing so
necessarily requires revealing all the chosen labels.

Accumulation could be done by Sally to avoid this leak,
at the cost of expensive ciphertext operations, including po-
tentially multiple interactive rounds to change the plaintext
modulus and count up the occurrences of each label. Thus,
while this design is somewhat more secure, it adds commu-
nication complexity in addition to computational complexity.

8 Evaluation
We evaluate COPSE in several ways. First, we evaluate how
well COPSE performs against the prior state-of-the-art in

secure decision forest inference, Aloufi et al. [1]. This evalu-
ation looks at sequential and parallel performance, and fo-
cuses on the classic, offloading-focused privacy model where
the model and data are owned by one party, and the server is
another party (see Section 7). Second, we consider COPSE’s
ability to handle different party configurations, in particular,
when the server and model are owned by one party, and
the data by another. Finally, we use microbenchmarks to
understand COPSE’s sensitivity to different aspects of the
models: depth, number of branches, and feature precision.

8.1 Benchmarks, Configurations, and Systems
To evaluate COPSE, we synthesized several microbenchmark
models that varied the number of levels, number of branches,
and the bits of precision used for expressing thresholds. We
use these microbenchmarks both for performance studies
(this section) and for sensitivity studies (Section 5. In ad-
dition to microbenchmarks, we obtained open-source ML
data sets to train decision forests for real-world benchmarks,
income [15] and soccer [16]. We used the scikit-learn li-
brary [17] to train random forest classifiers on these data
sets. For each of the real-world data sets, we generated two
differently-sized models (suffixed 5 and 15), reflecting the
number of decision trees comprising each forest.

Configuring HELib involves setting several encryption
parameters: the security parameter, the number of bits in
the modulus chain, and the number of columns in the key-
switching matrices. Increasing the security parameter re-
sults in larger ciphertexts, increasing security and compu-
tation time; increasing the number of bits in the modulus
chain increases the maximum multiplicative depth the cir-
cuit can reach; and changing the number of columns in the
key-switching matrices affects the available vector widths.
We performed a sweep over the range of possible encryp-
tion parameters for our models, and found a single set of
parameters that worked sufficiently well. Table 5 lists the
encryption parameters we used. (Note that it is possible that
for other models, or other FHE implementations, other pa-
rameters will be superior; autotuning these parameters can
be incorporated into the staging process, as described in
Section 5.)

All experiments were performed on a 32-core, 2.7 GHz
Intel Xeon E5-4650 server with 192 GB of RAM. Each core
has 256 KB of L2 cache, and each set of 8 cores shares a 20
MB last-level-cache.

8.2 COPSE Performance
Our first evaluation focuses on the sequential and parallel
performance of COPSE. Our baseline for COPSE is the state-
of-the-art approach for performing secure decision forest
evaluation in FHE, by Aloufi et al. [1]. Because Aloufi et al.’s
implementation was not available, we implemented their al-
gorithms ourselves. We made our best effort to optimize our
reimplementation, including introducing parallelism with
Intel’s Thread Building Blocks [18] (indeed, our implemen-
tation appears to scale better than Aloufi et al.’s reported
scalability). Crucially, both our baseline and COPSE use the
same FHE library, and the same implementation of SecComp,
which was introduced by Aloufi et al. [1].

We evaluated both implementations on two primary cri-
teria: how quickly the compiled models could execute infer-
ence queries, and how effectively COPSE was able to take
advantage of parallelism to scale to larger models. For each
model, we performed 27 inference queries, in both single-
threaded and multithreaded mode. We report the median
running time across these queries (confidence intervals in
all cases were negligible).

Figure 6 shows the relative speedups over prior work for
each model compiled using COPSE. We see that we have a
substantial speedup over the baseline, ranging from 5× to
over 7×, with a geometric mean of close to 6×.

Multithreading. Next, we ran inference queries on the
models with multithreading enabled. For all queries, we ran
the systems using 32 threads. While the individual queries
were mutithreaded, they were still executed sequentially one
after another.

Figure 7 shows the multithreaded speedup of COPSE over
single-threaded COPSE. Note that in this study, we evaluated
even larger models for our real-world datasets, as COPSE is
able to evaluate these in a reasonable amount of time while
our baseline is not. We see that while parallel speedup for the
microbenchmarks is relatively modest (around 2.5×), parallel
speedup for the real-world models is much better (almost
5×), as we might expect: the real-world models are larger,
and present more parallel work.

Figure 8 compares COPSE’s parallel performance to our
baseline. We note that it appears that COPSE scales worse
than the baseline (if they scaled equally well, the speedups
in Figure 8 would match the speedups in Figure 6). The
source of this seeming shortcoming is subtle. COPSE’s de-
sign makes heavy use of ciphertext packing to amortize the
overheads of FHE computation. This ciphertext packing es-
sentially consumes some of the parallel work in the form
of “vectorized” operations, even in the single-threaded case,
leaving the COPSE implementations with less parallelism to
exploit using “normal” parallelization techniques. In contrast,
all of these parallelism opportunities can only be exploited
by multithreading in the baseline (and recall that our base-
line implementation appears to scale better than the original

party (o the model has to be encrypted). Figure 9 shows the
speedup of inference when using the second configuration
(plaintext models) versus the first (ciphertext models). As
expected, we see that plaintext models result in substantial
speedups of roughly 1.4×.

8.4 Evaluation on Microbenchmarks
To better understand the different components of COPSE,
we used eight randomly-generated forests with different
properties: feature precision, maximum levels, number of
trees, and number of branches. The details on the size of each
forest can be found in Table 6. Every forest had 2 features
and 3 distinct labels. Figure 10 shows the median running
time for each model, broken down by the time each step took
(comparison, reshuffling, processing levels, and aggregating).
To facilitate comparison, each sub-figure compares models
that are similar except for a particular parameter under test.

Effects of depth. Figure 10a shows models that differ in
terms of tree depth. Comparison and reshaping times are
largely unaffected by the maximum forest depth, whereas the
total level processing time increases approximately linearly.
Aggregation time is logarithmic in depth, but this is negligi-
bly small compared to the rest of the evaluation. This makes
sense because at each depth level there is approximately an
equal amount of work to be done.

implementation). We can observe this effect by noting that
the gap in scaling is smaller for the larger, real-world models
(income5 and soccer5): there is more parallelism to start
with, so even after ciphertext packing, there is more paral-
lelism for COPSE to exploit.

8.3 Different Party Setups
As discussed in Section 7, the two-party setup used by COPSE
admits different configurations for the identities of these
parties. We would expect to see speedup if Maurice and
Sally are the same party (so the models can be represented in

Effects of branching. Figure 10b shows models that dif-
fer in terms of number of branches. While the comparison
time is unaffected by branching, both the reshaping time
and total level processing time are. The relationship between
branching and reshaping is close to linear, as reshaping ac-
tually depends linearly on the quantized branching. By con-
trast, the total level processing time is directly proportional
to the number of branches. This is because the matrix at
each level has a number of columns equal to the number of
branches. Thus for a model with twice as many branches,
the corresponding matrices will be twice as wide and take
twice as long to process without multithreading.

Effects of precision. Finally, Figure 10c shows models
that differ in terms of feature precision. Reshaping, level
processing, and aggregation are, as expected, unaffected by
changing the model precision. However, as suggested by the
complexity analysis in Section 6, comparison time increases
super-linearly with precision. This superlinear relationship
is evident from the data in Figure 10c.

9 Conclusion
In this paper we presented COPSE, a staging compiler and
runtime for decision forest models that takes advantage of
the noninterference semantics of fully-homomorphic en-
cryption to relax control-flow dependences and map these
models to vectorizable, FHE-based primitives. COPSE rep-
resents the first approach to exploit ciphertext packing to
perform secure, decision forest inference.

We showed that COPSE can automatically stage decision-
forest models, including large-scale ones trained on real-
world datasets, into efficient, specialized C++ programs im-
plemented using our novel primitives. We further showed
that these implementations significantly outperform state-of-
the-art secure inference algorithms, while still scaling well
(especially for larger models).

This paper thus represents the next step in building effi-
cient, secure inference procedures for machine-learned mod-
els. Future work includes implementing COPSE’s primitives
not in terms of low-level FHE libraries like HELib but instead

14

in terms of higher-level FHE-based intermediate languages,
like EVA [9], allowing for further tuning and optimization.
