ABSTRACT

Breakthrough Listen is the most comprehensive and sensitive search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) to date,
employing a collection of international observational facilities including both radio and optical telescopes. During the
ﬁrst three years of the Listen program, thousands of targets have been observed with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT),
Parkes Telescope and Automated Planet Finder. At GBT and Parkes, observations have been performed ranging from
700 MHz to 26 GHz, with raw data volumes averaging over 1 PB / day. A pseudo-real time software spectroscopy suite
is used to produce multi-resolution spectrograms amounting to approximately 400 GB h−1 GHz−1 beam−1. For certain
targets, raw baseband voltage data is also preserved. Observations with the Automated Planet Finder produce both
2-dimensional and 1-dimensional high resolution (R ∼ 105) echelle spectral data.

Although the primary purpose of Listen data acquisition is for SETI, a range of secondary science has also been
performed with these data, including studies of fast radio bursts. Other current and potential research topics include
spectral line studies, searches for certain kinds of dark matter, probes of interstellar scattering, pulsar searches,
radio transient searches and investigations of stellar activity. Listen data are also being used in the development of
algorithms, including machine learning approaches to modulation scheme classiﬁcation and outlier detection, that have
wide applicability not just for astronomical research but for a broad range of science and engineering.

In this paper, we describe the hardware and software pipeline used for collection, reduction, archival, and public
dissemination of Listen data. We describe the data formats and tools, and present Breakthrough Listen Data Release
1.0 (BLDR 1.0), a deﬁned set of publicly-available raw and reduced data totalling 1 PB.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Breakthrough Listen (hereafter BL) project (Worden et al. 2018), announced at the Royal Society in London
in 2015 July, is currently undertaking searches for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) at telescope facilities across the
globe. Motivated by the idea that some human technologies used for communication, propulsion, or other purposes,
generate signatures that could be detected by a suﬃciently sensitive telescope at interstellar distances, BL conducts
observational astronomy programs targeting such “technosignatures” that may betray the presence of technology, and
hence advanced life, on worlds other than our own.

Currently, BL undertakes the search for technosignatures at both radio and optical wavelengths. The radio search
currently employs two large single-dish telescopes, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT; MacMahon
et al. 2018) in West Virginia, USA, and the CSIRO Parkes Radio Telescope (Price et al. 2018) in New South Wales,
Australia. The optical search currently employs the Automated Planet Finder (APF) at Lick Observatory in California,
USA. The program will soon expand to include radio observations using the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa and
the VERITAS Cherenkov Telescope at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona, USA. Pilot programs and collaboration
agreements are also in place for additional facilities, including the FAST 500m telescope in Guizhou Province, China
(Ini 2016), the Murchison Wideﬁeld Array in Western Australia (Tingay et al. 2018), and the Jodrell Bank Observatory
in Manchester, UK.

Core observational goals for the BL program include multiwavelength observations of ∼1700 nearby stars and 100
nearby galaxies, a radio survey of one million additional nearby stars and radio and optical observations of the
Galactic Plane and the Galactic Center (GP/GC). The one million star survey will be performed using dedicated
digital beamformer hardware at MeerKAT, allowing dozens of stars within the primary MeerKAT ﬁeld of view to be
observed simultaneously. These commensal (contemporaneously using the same data stream) observations will occur
with the BL instrument alongside all other uses of the facility.

In addition to the core program, BL occasionally observes other targets of interest. These have thus far included
objects in our own Solar System, including the asteroid BZ 509 (Price et al. 2019) the interstellar object ‘Oumuamua
(Enriquez et al. 2018), as well as other “exotica” such as Boyajian’s Star (Wright & Sigurdsson 2016), Ross 128
(Enriquez et al. 2019), candidate technosigntures from other research programs (Croft et al. 2016) and a number of
fast radio bursts (FRBs). The BL backends at GBT and Parkes have also been made available in shared-risk mode
for proposals from the astronomical community, which are considered for allocations of general observer time by the
telescope time allocation committees.

The bulk of observations conducted during the ﬁrst three years of the BL program have focused on nearby stars
drawn from the sample described by Isaacson et al. (2017). An initial SETI search of GBT data on 692 stars from
this sample was presented by Enriquez et al. (2017). Since 2016, additional stars from Isaacson et al. (2017) have been
observed by the BL facilities, and our analysis techniques have been, and continue to be, reﬁned. An updated analysis
of radio observations of a larger sample of these stars is presented in Price et al. (submitted).

This paper describes our data acquisition, formats, reduction, and archiving. We also announce the release of ∼ 1 PB

of public data, which forms BL Data Release 1.0 (BLDR 1.0), and consists of:

• Radio spectrograms for the 1327 stars presented in the analysis of Price et al. (submitted) – 882 from L-band
and 1005 from S-band receivers at GBT (Table 1) and 189 from the 10-cm receiver at Parkes, along with
corresponding observations of pulsar, ﬂux calibrator, and reference (“oﬀ”) sources

• Optical spectra, including both 2D and corresponding extracted 1D spectra, for 789 stars observed by APF

• Raw time domain voltage data and corresponding spectrograms from radio observations of FRB 121102 (GBT)

and FRB 180301 (Parkes)

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes data acquisition and reduction procedures
for BL observations with GBT and Parkes, Section 3 describes data acquisition and reduction procedures for BL
observations with APF, and Section 4 details the design and interface for the BL public data archive. Appendix A
describes the ﬁle naming conventions used for BL data products. Appendix B lists the header information for raw
and ﬁlterbank ﬁles.

2. BREAKTHROUGH LISTEN ON GBT AND PARKES

The digital backends used by BL at radio observatories consist of clusters of compute nodes with large amounts of
storage, each with one or more graphics processing units (GPUs) for reduction and processing; storage nodes, with
additional capacity intended for longer-term data storage, and head nodes that provide boot images and a login gateway
to the compute and storage nodes. The GBT BL instrument (MacMahon et al. 2018) saw ﬁrst light in 2015 December,
and currently consists of 9 storage nodes and 65 compute nodes (64 active plus one spare), with a total usable capacity
of ∼ 8 PB. The Parkes BL instrument (Price et al. 2018) saw ﬁrst light in 2016 September, and currently consists
of 6 storage nodes and 27 compute nodes (26 active plus one spare), with capacity 3.5 PB. The upcoming MeerKAT
instrument will be described in a future paper.

The basic data pipeline is illustrated graphically in Figure 1, and is described in detail below. At Parkes and GBT,
BL compute nodes receive digitized complex voltages from FPGA data acquisition systems (MacMahon et al. 2018),
which are subsequently written to large disk arrays in GUPPI (Green Bank Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument;
Ransom et al. 2009) raw format. The GUPPI format is derived from the FITS standard (Wells et al. 1981; Pence
et al. 2010), and has been used in a number of other SETI experiments that employed the original GUPPI instrument,
beginning with Siemion et al. (2013) and continuing more recently with Margot et al. (2018) and Pinchuk et al. (2019).
Each BL compute node (denoted blc00 through blcXY in Figure 1) captures a portion of the total bandwidth during
observing with a maximum of 187.5 MHz of dual-polarization, 8-bit sampled voltage data at a rate of 6 Gb s−1 per node.
While the raw data format allows for frequency overlap between nodes, BL does not implement this functionality.

BL observing sessions last between 2 and 12 hours. During the gaps between sessions,which are at least as long as
the sessions themselves, raw data are processed using a GPU-accelerated Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) code, and the
resultant spectrograms are archived. For certain targets of interest, we also choose to archive some of the raw voltages
to permit additional post-processing. One example of such a target is FRB 121102; the 400 TB raw dataset that was
used in the analysis of Gajjar et al. (2018) and Zhang et al. (2018) is being made publicly available as part of BLDR
1.0.

Searches for technosignatures are performed with custom pipelines. These include SPANDAK (Gajjar et al. 2018),
used to search for broadband pulses, and TurboSETI (Enriquez et al. 2017), used to search for narrowband drifting
signals, in addition to algorithms under development including machine learning approaches.

2.1. Observing strategy

The standard BL observing procedure at GBT and Parkes is to observe in cadences of 30 minutes. Primary targets
are selected from a MySQL target database (Figure 1), and observing scripts are generated for each session based on
designated target priorities and the amount of data already obtained for each target. The database is updated after
each run. The observing script controls the observations via an interface with the facility software (astrid and cleo
at GBT1; TCS at Parkes2), and also manages the operation of the BL backend cluster which records the digitized raw
voltages from the telescope.

For single-pixel instruments at GBT and Parkes, an observing strategy of alternating (or “nodding”) between
intended sources and nearby reference points in the sky is adopted in order to discriminate against the main contaminant
for any radio SETI search: human generated radio frequency interference (RFI). The intensity and morphology of
detected RFI signals may vary with time and with telescope position, but almost never in such a way that only
the intended sources are aﬀected but not the reference sources. By looking for signals detected in only the primary
location, we thereby apply a spatial ﬁlter that preferentially isolates signals that may be coming from the direction of
the primary target being observed.

Each primary target is observed for three 5-minute integrations, interspersed with three 5-minute scans of nearby
comparison targets. Primary targets are denoted as “A” or “ON” targets. Early in the BL program our “OFF”
targets were a nearby blank sky pointing (reﬂected with an “ OFF” suﬃx in the target name), but several months
after our GBT program began we modiﬁed the strategy. Instead of nodding to a nearby blank part of the sky we
now alternate the primary “A” targets with three diﬀerent nearby stars (denoted “B”, “C”, and “D”), such that our
standard cadence is now “ABACAD”. This method maximizes the number of observed stars while still allowing for

and reduction steps and brick-colored boxes represent analysis pipelines. Green boxes represent physical compute hardware
and resources, i.e. the BL compute nodes (blcXY), storage nodes (blsX), public data nodes (blpdX), and cloud storage through
which the data passes. Parenthetical tags show data formats when ﬁles are created or converted. The dashed arrows illustrate
that while most raw data are not archived indeﬁnitely (§ 2), a small fraction of the raw data is made available as part of our
public datasets, and during reduction a small fraction is passed to the SETI@home volunteer distributed computing project
(Anderson et al. 2002).).

RFI detection and removal. An example set of recently recorded Green Bank data is shown in Figure 2. Information
regarding the ﬁle naming conventions is given in Appendix A.

For Parkes we kept the original strategy of nodding between the target source and a nearby blank point in the sky
(Price et al. (submitted)). The target naming of on/oﬀ sources is diﬀerent than at GBT due to TCS conventions. The
“ON” targets have an “ S” suﬃx (source) and the “OFF” targets have an “ R” suﬃx (reference).

We typically observe one bright pulsar and one bright radio calibrator at the beginning of each session. Immediately
after each pulsar observation, the pulsar data are processed using the standard pulsar tools. We use prepfold from
PRESTO (Ransom 2011), DSPSR (van Straten & Bailes 2011), and PSRCHIVE (van Straten et al. 2012) to check
that the pulsar is detected, and as a diagnostic of instrument performance. The expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
is compared with the observed SNR as a diagnostic of instrument sensitivity (Figure 3). Since pulsars are known to
show scintillation prohibiting their use for ﬂux calibration, we also observe standard ﬂux calibrator sources during
each session. Flux calibration is not currently a part of our standard reduction pipeline – we perform detection and
signal characterization in instrumental units, or perform an approximate calibration using the radiometer equation.

respectively). Good candidate technosignatures would be expected to appear only in observations of the “A” target (top row),
and be absent from the comparison observations (bottom row).

Note: There are no C-band, X-band, or Parkes Multibeam HDF5 products as part of this release - we haven’t
yet decided how much we want to trim down these products and will make such determinations when we have
a more complete data set.

However, work is underway to ﬂux- and polarization-calibrate all of our data products. This work will be extended
back to data in our archive using the calibrator sources that have been observed thus far.

At GBT we can record up to a 10 GHz-wide band from any of the GBT receivers; this is the full bandwidth that
the analog downconversion systems can deliver from any given receiver. The ﬁrst three years of our GBT program
have primarily consisted of stars drawn from the Isaacson et al. (2017) sample, observed at L-, S-, C-, and X-bands
(Table 1). The majority of the stars from that sample that are visible from GBT have now been observed at both
L- and S-band (center frequencies of 1500 and 2400 MHz respectively), and the associated data ﬁles are being made
available in BLDR 1.0. Raw data ﬁles are native linear polarization; ﬁlterbank ﬁles are Stokes I.

package. The top panel shows integrated full-Stokes proﬁles obtained from 5-minute long observations. The bottom panel shows
the intensity as a function of frequency and pulse phase. Frequencies between 7100 to 7500 MHz were ﬂagged due to RFI.

At Parkes, we can record up to an aggregate 4.875 GHz of bandwidth, dual polarization (native linear), either from
single-pixel feeds such as the 10-cm receiver or the Ultra-Wide-Band feed (Hobbs et. al., in prep), or distributed as
308 MHz bands from each of the 13 beams of the Multibeam receiver. We focused on nearby stars with declinations
less than −20 degrees from the sample of Isaacson et al. (2017) with the 10-cm receiver, and the associated data ﬁles
are being made available in BLDR 1.0.

We are in process of commissioning use of additional receivers at both telescopes – for example the K-band focal
plane array (KFPA) at GBT, and the Ultra-wideband receiver (UWL) at Parkes. Data from these receivers will be
made available in the future.

2.2. Raw data

Each raw ﬁle consists of a sequence of header units and corresponding chunks of data referred to as blocks, repre-

senting data collected over the course of an observation in time-contiguous order.

Each line in the headers conforms to the FITS standard of 80 bytes (an 8 byte keyword and associated values). To
reduce overhead and maximize the rate at which data are written to disk, ﬁles are written using Direct I/O, a method
by which applications can bypass the operating system caches and write more directly to storage devices. This mode
is faster and preferred when doing long sequential writes of random data (and thus caching is ineﬀective). However
Direct I/O requires 512 byte writes. Headers must therefore be padded with zeros after the last 80 byte FITS header
to round them up multiples of 512 bytes. This padding is incompatible with many existing data reduction tools which
expect the data payload to begin immediately after the header’s last key/value pair. At ﬁrst our pipeline contained
a “ﬁx up” script, rewriting the ﬁles without the header padding. We later updated the reduction tools to handle raw
data ﬁles with or without this padding. The two methods are diﬀerentiated by an extra ﬁeld in the header (keyword
directio) which is either 0 to reﬂect that the current header is not padded or 1 to reﬂect the header is padded. The
last line contains end, after which the binary data, or the padding up to the next 512 byte boundary, begins.

Raw digitized voltages are coarsely channelized into 512 polyphase channels (MacMahon et al. 2018; Price et al.
2018) across a Nyquist bandwidth of 1500 MHz, resulting in 64 channels over 187.5 MHz per compute node and a coarse
channel width BWpolyphase = 2.93 MHz. For L- and S-band observations, the RF band is inverted at IF, resulting in
an RF band ranging from ftuning + 750 MHz to ftuning − 750 MHz in the IF range 0 − 1500 MHz. Frequency inversion
can be deduced from the FITS keyword OBSBW. The absolute value represents the bandwidth of the ﬁle in MHz; if
it is negative the frequencies are inverted.

Figure 4. Detection of the 22 GHz H2O maser feature in DR 21 using the KFPA receiver at GBT and the medium resolution
(MR) BL data product as described in Table 3. he polyphase channel shape and DC feature described in Section 2.5 are
apparent. While we haven’t made any K-band data available in this data release, this analysis is from data collected during
early commissioning of this receiver and helps to further demonstrate our data and analysis potential even at this lower resolution.

There are diﬀerences in block sizes in BLDR 1.0 (keyword blocsize in the ﬁle headers), due to moving from
older standards which accounted for overlapping blocks (Figure 8) to more optimal sizes, and in the case of Parkes
Multibeam data, due to network bandwidth limitations (Table 2). The diﬀerences in block size result in slightly
diﬀerent resolutions in the resulting ﬁlterbank data products, as detailed in § 2.3 and Table 4. The raw ﬁle format is
illustrated graphically in Figure 7.

The data portion of each block consists of voltages split into a number speciﬁed by the header keyword obsnchan.
Each coarse channel is ∼ 3 MHz wide, and made up of ∼ 512, 000 8-bit real / 8-bit imaginary samples in two po-
larizations (32 bits, or 4 bytes, total per sample). The ﬁrst pair of 8 bit values in the four byte set contains the
real and imaginary values for channel 1, polarization 1, and time block 1. The second pair contains the real and
imaginary values for channel 1, polarization 2, and time block 1. The subsequent bytes contain the same information
for increasing time blocks. This pattern follows for the remaining channels (Figure 7).

2.3. Spectrograms
As noted above (§ 2), during the time between observing sessions, the raw data passes through the reduction and
analysis pipeline, and in most cases the raw data are deleted to make space on the drives for the subsequent observing
session.

For the majority of targets, the raw data are passed to a GPU-accelerated code, gpuspec, to produce three ﬁles,
each containing an array of integrated power as a function of frequency and time (Table 3). The input raw data are
the same, but the output resolutions of the three ﬁles are optimized to support narrow-band SETI searches, pulsar
observations, and astrophysical spectral line studies (although in practice they are not limited to these applications).

The resultant ﬁles are written in Sigproc “ﬁlterbank” format, a relatively simple type of spectral data ﬁle with an

origin in pulsar astronomy (Lorimer 2006). In order of operation, this code:

• Reads data from ﬁle in GUPPI raw format.

• Performs three diﬀerent fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) with diﬀerent numbers of channels. This operation is

performed on the GPU device, using the NVIDIA cufft library.

• Squares the channelized output, add the two polarizations together, and integrates in time to form Stokes I data

in GPU device memory.

• Writes output data to ﬁles in Sigproc ﬁlterbank format (Figure 2).

The ﬁlterbank ﬁles are simply a header followed by a two dimensional array of integrated power (as 32-bit ﬂoats) as a
function of radio frequency and time (as shown in Figure 9). The ﬁlterbank format was chosen as it is well understood
by already existing pulsar analysis tools.

The set of three ﬁlterbank products take up roughly 2% the disk space of the original GUPPI raw data products. A
small number of targets (e.g. “special” observations such as FRB 121102, diagnostic targets, and pulsar observations)
are denoted by adding the string ‘DIAG’ to the target name in order to preserve the raw data products as discussed
in Appendix A.

The data portion of any ﬁlterbank product is described by values in the ﬁle’s metadata: fch1, foff, and nchans.
These are the center frequency of the ﬁrst ﬁne channel of an integration, the frequency delta between adjacent ﬁne

Once reduced, the ﬁlterbank ﬁles are spliced (i.e. data from each of the 187.5-MHz-wide frequency bands from each

compute node are combined) and collated onto local storage nodes at each respective observatory.

Some existing analysis tools for pulsar/high time resolution searches prefer the ﬁlterbank ﬁles to have 8-bit integer

values instead of the default 32-bit ﬂoat. This conversion is done using the sum fil program3.

The Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5)4 is in wider use than ﬁlterbank (particularly outside of the scientiﬁc
community). To improve the accessibility of BL data, as well as to take advantage of additional functionality provided
by HDF5 (including improved data compressibility) we convert our ﬁlterbank ﬁles into HDF5 before making them
publicly available.

We have developed a software suite5, blimpy (Breakthrough Listen I/O Methods for PYthon), to import and
display ﬁlterbank, HDF5, and GUPPI RAW data in Python (BL Collaboration 2019). blimpy also contains tools for
conversion of ﬁlterbank to HDF5. blimpy will be described in more detail in an upcoming paper.

As part of the conversion from ﬁlterbank to HDF5 we check pointings against historic telescope records and adjust
ﬁne channel oﬀsets. Originally reduced data products were created with ﬁrst channels incorrectly labeled at their
center frequencies instead of at the edge; these half-channel errors only aﬀect the headers and not the data. We also
trim away the edges of the frequency range where the bandpass sensitivity falls oﬀ, thus signiﬁcantly reducing the size
of the data using the blimpy bldice command.

In general, we trim the GBT L-band data down to the 1025−1925 MHz range, GBT S-band data to 1820−2720 MHz,
and Parkes 10CM to 2574 − 3444 MHz. Some ﬁles contain smaller ranges of frequencies; reasons for this may include:
• Early on in the project ﬁles were trimmed by including only data from the central four compute nodes recording

the most sensitive parts of the bandpass

• Due to intermittent system/disks failures while building out each backend system, data from some nodes were

unusable, and thus certain ranges are missing.

• Occasional tuning errors caused the center frequency to be oﬀ by enough to bring the bandpass outside of the

recorded range.

2.5. Instrumental Eﬀects and Data Artifacts

At both GBT and Parkes, the complete BL signal chain includes numerous components, from radio receivers, through
analog signal downconversion, digital sampling, channelization, retransmission, recording and ﬁnally software post
processing. Virtually all of these components impose instrumental eﬀects on the resultant data products, and many
of them suﬀer sporadic faults. These issues are compounded by instrument commissioning, testing and continuous
software development. Here we detail several of the most prominent instrumental features found in BLDR 1.0 and
highlight known data artifacts aﬀecting a small percentage of the collection. We note that this list is not exhaustive,
and caution should be taken in ruling out previously undiscovered instrumental problems when encountering anomalies
in the data set.

Figure 10. One-dimensional S-band spectra (collapsing the time dimension from the spectrogram) plotted using the same data
for HIP 28614 from the top left panel of Figure 2. The left panel shows the spliced data for all 8 compute nodes. The dip around
∼ 2330 MHz is due to the observatory’s S-band notch ﬁlter (which is used to reduce interference from Sirius and XM satellite
transmissions). Bright RFI is also visible at ∼ 2200 MHz. The middle panel zooms in to show 1/8 of the data (the 187.5 MHz
from compute node blc04), showing the lower-gain region corresponding to the notch ﬁlter in more detail. The 64 individual
3-MHz-wide coarse channels are visible, each with a fall-oﬀ at each edge of the coarse channel, and each with a spike in the
DC bin at the center of the coarse channel. Each of the coarse channels is more ﬁnely channelized by the gpuspec FFT: 8 ﬁne
channels per coarse channel for the HTR data product, 1024 ﬁne channels per coarse channel for the MR (the data product
plotted here), and 1, 048, 576 ﬁne channels per coarse channel for the HSR data product (Table 3). The right panel is zoomed
into the 2280–3000 MHz range to better depict the polyphase shape of roughly 7 coarse channels.

Figure 11. Examples of spectra similar to Figure 10 for both the L-band receiver at Green Bank (left) and the Parkes 10CM
receiver (right). The L-band receiver has a notch ﬁlter between 1.2–1.34 GHz to reduce interference from nearby air surveillance
radar. These examples are also trimmed to a smaller range of frequencies, as described in Section 2.4.

2.5.1. Radio Frequency Interference

Radio telescopes are highly susceptible to RFI, from local transmitters as well as both airborne and spaceborne
sources. Such interference can dominate the data, given its power, perseverance, and multitude of forms. Often
the strength of these transmitters is suﬃcient to cause their apparent power to spread well beyond the time and
frequency extent of the speciﬁc transmission due to analog saturation and digital overﬂow. It is diﬃcult to overstate
the pervasiveness, diversity and challenge of RFI in searches for radio technosignatures.

Data collected from the single pixel receivers use a strategy depicted in Section 2.1 to help ﬁlter out local interference.
Further information about RFI detection and mitigation of spectrograms included in this data release is presented in
Price et al. (submitted).

The incoming analog bandpass is not ﬂat and diﬀerent for all receivers. These are described in the respective Green
Bank6 and Parkes observing guides7. The BL instrument also imposes its own polyphase ﬁlter shape on the data (Price
2016). Each coarse channel (∼ 3 MHz) has a reduction in sensitivity toward the channel edges, and a DC channel in

Figure 12. These are targets from one of a small number of observational cadences aﬀected by patches of reduced sensitivity
due to dropped ethernet packets during the course of an observation. The aﬀected data are visible as blue rectangles spanning
1/8 of the total band of a given 1500 MHz band of eight compute nodes, i.e. the 187.5 MHz associated with individual nodes.
The length in time (or “height”) of these rectangles is arbitrary, as it only happens when a particular node is missing data due
to several factors that are hard to predict or control. Most datasets in BLDR 1.0 are not aﬀected in this manner, but these
dropped packets are not to be confused with expected reduced sensitivity due to notch ﬁlters (such as the one shown here from
2300-2360 MHz) and the areas outside of the bandpass (i.e. below 1800 MHz and above 2700 MHz in this case).

the center. A typical coarse channel shape (along with some RFI) is shown in Figure 10. There are no corrections for
these in the public data.

2.5.3. Dropped Blocks and Lost Data

Occasionally other issues aﬀecting data quality arise. During observations each compute node receives about 1
GB s−1 of data from the telescope. Hardware issues (failing hard drives, degraded RAID arrays, faulty switches, bad
cables, xfs partition fragmentation which reduces write speeds even when using Direct I/O) can impede the ability of
the compute nodes to record data at this rate, resulting in dropped blocks (short spots of missing data). This causes
an occasional reduction in sensitivity, the eﬀects of which are shown in Figure 12.

More rarely, problems with the communication between the BL backend and the telescope may result in gaps of

187.5 MHz where data are completely lost for a particular compute node.

In addition to these occasional hardware or software issues, bad weather may reduce sensitivity, or cause observations
to stop mid-scan to park the telescope for safety. Additionally, observations at the end of each BL session may consist
of less than ﬁve minutes of data.

2.5.4. Two-bit requantization of raw data

During early commissioning at GBT (approximately MJD 57402–57502) we requantized the raw data from 8-bit to
2-bit (1 bit real / 1 bit imaginary) using the raw quant program8 in order to reduce disk usage. The methodology
of this process is described below. This step is no longer performed except when creating data to be copied oﬀsite
for the SETI@home project (Figure 1)). Data requantized to 2-bits shows a signiﬁcantly diminished analog bandpass
response, has reduced sensitivity and issues with saturation in the presence of strong sources.

direction and 2,080 pixels in the spatial direction, containing 79 spectral orders. The zoomed image in the upper-right corner
is a segment of one of these spectral orders, which shows a cosmic ray in the bottom right corner. The wavelength coverage of
the Levy is 373.0 − 1020.6 nm; however CCD fringing limits the usability of the reddest orders.

Where -N, -1, 1, N are the voltage values represented by each quantized sample and vo is the unquantized threshold.
From the table, optimal eﬃciency for this scheme is achieved by taking vo = 0.98159883 * rms and N = 3.3358750.

Theoretical eﬃciency in this case is given as ∼0.8825.

We apply this scheme in the following way:

• Open a raw guppi data ﬁle and calculate the rms and mean for each channel-polarization in the ﬁrst sub

integration ( 1 sec)

• Subtract oﬀ the mean from each sample, and bin according to the thresholds above.

We’ll assign a 2 bit value to each of the above bins as follows:

3. OPTICAL: BL ON APF

The Automated Planet Finder Telescope (APF; Radovan et al. 2014) is a 2.4-meter optical telescope at Lick Observa-
tory in California. Its primary aim is to search for earth-like extrasolar planets. The single instrument is a R ∼ 95, 000
optical echelle spectrometer with wavelength coverage from 374 to 950 nm. BL uses the APF for 36 nights per year
and targets nearby stars with a maximum exposure time of 20 minutes (aiming for an optimal signal-to-noise ratio of
100:1). Three spectra are obtained for each star in order to more easily distinguish cosmic ray hits from interesting
signals. The nominal decker projects to a sky angle of 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48) × 3.0(cid:48)(cid:48), which at 10 pc corresponds to 10 × 30 AU, allowing
the detection of laser emission from planets that are oﬀset from their stars, as well as emitters that may lie in the
foreground or background within the line of sight (Tellis & Marcy 2015).

The two standard data products available from the APF are the raw 2D image (each 18.3 MB), an example of which
is shown in Figure 13, and the extracted 1D spectrum (each 1.4 MB), as shown in Figure 14. These ﬁles adhere to the
common FITS standard (Wells et al. 1981; Pence et al. 2010) and are thus easily readable by existing tools.

BL utilizes both the raw and reduced images to search for monochromatic laser lines that are narrow in wavelength
space and match the point-spread-function (in the raw images) and line-spread-function (in the reduced images) of
the instrument. Typical searches by BL are described by Tellis & Marcy (2017) and Lipman et al. (2019), including
details of cosmic ray removal, telluric absorption and emission lines, and blaze function correction. Each BL night
is run in collaboration with the California Planet Search and utilizes scheduling software described by Holden et al.
(2016).

star. Clockwise from top left: H-alpha, the Sodium-D doublet, the Magnesium B triplet and the Calcium II H-line showing
broad absorption. Fluxes are in photons per pixel.

As with the radio searches of nearby stars, targets are selected from the sample of Isaacson et al. (2017). Files for a
total of 789 targets are available as part of BLDR 1.0. A tutorial, a description of headers and data formats, as well
as example ﬁles are also available online9.

4. THE BREAKTHROUGH LISTEN PUBLIC DATA ARCHIVE

The BL data archive strategy is designed to facilitate analysis by the internal science team as well as engagement
by external parties. Key information about the public data products is kept in a MySQL database containing basic
metadata and URLs for all available ﬁles. Frontends to this database are provided via a portal on the Breakthrough
Initiatives website10, and also by a beta interface with additional functionality hosted by Berkeley SETI Research
Center11 (Figure 15). Data can be searched by target name, times, frequencies, or location.

The majority of data in BLDR 1.0 are stored on 11 commodity public data servers at UC Berkeley, each with
roughly 200 TB of usable storage and its own 10 Gb s−1 link to the internet. Having a ﬂeet of separate servers increases
parallelization as well as uptime. Since the database can link to ﬁles hosted at any publicly-accessible URL, we can
also seamlessly link to data at national computing centers and commercial cloud providers. We anticipate our use of
cloud storage for BL data may increase in future.

Additional data, not yet available in BLDR 1.0, are still located on storage hardware at the telescope sites. Network
bandwidth limitations (a few Gb s−1) at the telescope sites prevent us from incorporating ﬁles stored there into the

archive directly, but as they are transferred to public servers on fast connections at UC Berkeley (or in the cloud), the
BL public data archive will continue to grow.

In future we also anticipate making increasing amounts of data available in other popular community-supported

formats such as SigMF (West & Hilburn 2019), or as images appropriate for machine learning algorithms.

The total volume of the archive is expected to grow to approximately 25 PB over the next several years, and will

ultimately include data from many facilities.

We are also exploring technologies such as Ceph12 and Globus13, which in combination with more ﬂexible downloads
enabled by HDF5 will allow users to download portions of ﬁles rather than necessitating an entire ﬁle (which can be
up to ∼ 100 GB in size) to be retrieved from the archive.

5. SUMMARY

The large data volumes, complex instrumentation and the intricacies of varied ﬁle formats make acquisition, pro-
cessing, and storage of BL data a challenging undertaking. With the release of BLDR 1.0 ,the BL open data archive
currently contains almost 1 PB of data. These data include the complete set of 1.10–3.45 GHz observations used in
the technosignature search presented by Price et al. (submitted) as well as raw and reduced data from a number
of particularly interesting targets for both SETI and general astrophysics. This is further quantiﬁed and described
in Appendix D. Data continue to be acquired at APF, GBT and Parkes, including new observing modes and radio
receivers. Future BL Data Releases will include these data, as well as data collected from new BL facilities such as
MeerKAT. With BLDR 1.0 and future releases, it is our hope that experts from outside the SETI community, and
even from outside radio astronomy, will be empowered to help us improve our technosignature searches and increase
the general scientiﬁc return from BL observations. The process of making these data available has already revealed
to us avenues for improvement in both organization and searchability - we will continue to strive for advancing the
general availability and usability of our data.

A. FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

A.0.1. Raw

For GBT:

blc<Node #> guppi <MJD Day> <MJD Seconds> <Target> <Scan #>.<File #>.raw

For Parkes:

blc<Node #> guppi <MJD Day> <MJD Seconds> <Packet Index> <Target> <Scan #>.<File #>.raw

Node #: As data are being recording, the ﬁlenames begin with the ‘guppi ’ preﬁx. Once reduced into ﬁlterbank
ﬁles, we add this ‘blc’ preﬁx (along with the number of the pertinent compute node) in order to denote successful
completion of the reduction, as well as remove ﬁle name collision with similarly named ﬁles on other compute nodes.
MJD Day, MJD Seconds, and Packet Index: Next is ‘MJD Day’ which is the integer portion of the Modiﬁed
Julian Date at the beginning of this scan, followed by ‘MJD Seconds’ which is the number of seconds of midnight
UTC. Filenames of early BL GBT data products do not contain ‘MJD seconds’. Due to naming collisions of multiple
observations of the same star in the same day, this was added at the end of 2016 January. At Parkes there is an
additional integer ﬁeld inserted in the ﬁlename between ‘MJD seconds’ and ‘Target’ relating to current packet index,
that is used for debugging the BL backend.

Target: The target name may contain underscores (making parsing diﬃcult). Diagnostic sources (e.g. pulsars) also
contain the string ‘DIAG’; the processing pipeline recognizes this tag and preserves raw data which would otherwise be
deleted after ﬁlterbank ﬁles have been generated. These raw data are kept for continued analysis, since they contain
the full resolution, as well as amplitude and phase information, that are lost on conversion to spectrograms. In all
other cases the raw data are immediately deleted after the ﬁlterbank ﬁles have been generated.

Scan number: These are provided by the observatory, start at 0001 at the beginning of each session, and increment

for each scan; due to diagnostics and interruptions numbers are not always sequential in the BL public datasets.

File number: Each raw ﬁle corresponds to ∼ 22.9 s of observation (128 blocks per ﬁle at 0.179 s per block), so
a typical 5-minute observation is split into 14 raw ﬁles, numbered sequentially. The ﬁle number starts at 0000 and
increments by 1 for each 128-block ﬁle. A 128-block ﬁle is about 16 GB. A partial raw ﬁle at the end of the series will
contain enough full blocks to complete the exact 5-minute scan and so is typically smaller than 16 GB.

Same as raw above, except .raw is replaced by: .gpuspec.<Resolution Type>.fil where <Resolution Type>

(noted in Table 3) is one of the following:

• 0000 : high spectral resolution (HSR)

• 0001 : high time resolution (HTR)

• 8.0001 : high time resolution (HTR), but 8-bit integers (a data type required, or preferred, by some analysis

tools) instead of the default 32-bit ﬂoats

• 0002 : medium spectral/time resolution (MR)

Some data products in BLDR 1.0 were processed with an updated version of gpuspec called rawspec which has
been optimized for speed and better use of GPU memory. In such cases “gpuspec” in the ﬁlenames is replaced by
“rawspec”.

The ﬁlterbank products from the separate compute nodes are typically spliced together into a single ﬁle. The names
of these single ﬁles contain the word “spliced”, along with an ordered list of the processing nodes which went into
making up these collated ﬁles. In a small fraction of cases where nodes experienced problems during recording for
a particular target, lost data from the missing nodes are padded with zeros, and the node numbers in the ﬁlename
replaced with ‘zz’. Unused overlapping nodes are also removed, and denoted ‘oo’ in the output ﬁlenames.

A.0.3. HDF5

Since the HDF5 version is the “ﬁnal” version, we remove some diagnostic information from the ﬁlenames, renaming

them for simplicity.

‘Telescope’ identiﬁes the telescope where the data were taken (GBT, Parkes, or future telescopes, e.g. MKat for
MeerKat). ‘MJD,’ ‘MJDsec,’ and ‘Target’ are the same as before, and as such the target name may include underscores.
‘Resolution’ is either “ﬁne” for ﬁne spectral resolution, “time” for ﬁne time resolution, and “mid” for mid spectral/time
resolution. Names are globally unique, human readable, and computer parsable.

HERENT CAL, or RAW)

OFFSET0: Not used

OFFSET1: Not used

OFFSET2: Not used

OFFSET3: Not used

ONLY I: Setting this to 1 enables total intensity data to be recorded in SEARCH and COHERENT SEARCH
only. Otherwise, this will be set to 0 for full-Stokes data.

OVERLAP: Number of time samples per channel overlapping between blocks. Always 0 for Breakthrough Listen
data.

PARFILE: For pulsar folding modes, full path the parameter ﬁle. Ignored in other modes.

PFB OVER: PFB number of overlapping channels. Not used by Breakthrough Listen code.

PKTFMT: UDP packet format. FAST4K or 1SFA.

PKTIDX: Recording diagnostic – current ﬁrst packet ID # of this block

PKTSIZE: Packet size (bytes)

PKTSTART: This is the expected PKTIDX value at the start of the scan (i.e. when recording should start).

PKTSTOP: This is the PKTIDX value at the end of the scan (i.e. when recording should stop).

POL TYPE: Not used

PROJID: Observing project ID / session code

RA STR: Right Ascension of the telescope (string form)

RA: Right ascension of the telescope (degrees) (Parkes: same as RA STR)

SCALE0: Not used

SCALE1: Not used

SCALE2: Not used

SCALE3: Not used

SCANLEN: Overall duration of the scan (i.e. recording) in seconds.

BL team

SCANREM: Seconds of scan time remaining.
occurring.

SCAN: GBT scan index #

Intended primarily as feedback for the observer while a scan is

SRC NAME: Name of current target, taken from the input catalog.

STTVALID: 1 if valid start time has been set

STT IMJD: Start time, integer MJD

STT OFFS: Start time, fractional second

STT SMJD: Start time, integer seconds within day (UTC)

SYNCTIME: (Parkes) Current UNIX epoch seconds.

TBIN: Time resolution of incoming data, (1 / abs(CHAN BW))

TELESCOP: Telescope name

TFOLD: Not used

TRK MODE: Tracking mode in use

ZA: Zenith Angle of the telescope

Table 7. Parkes Telescope 10CM band frequency table. The “X” in
the 10CM node name should be replaced by 0, 1, or 2 depending on
which bank of nodes recorded that session. “AB” in the Multibeam
node name refers to any given beam pair, where beam = int(((A ×
8) + B − 1)/2); “AC” is the next highest node. For example, blc01
and blc02 are beam 0, blc03 and blc04 are beam 1, blc05 and blc06
are beam 2, blc07 and blc10 are beam 3, etc.

D. SUMMARY OF AVAILABLE DATA PRODUCTS

At the time of writing, there are 94,534 ﬁles available for public download, described in more detail in Table 8.
Note: In this data release all Green Bank data products are in descending frequency order, and Parkes products are

in ascending frequency.

Within these ﬁles are several important subsets, easily ﬁndable via searches on the open data web sites noted in

Section 4:

• The FRB121102 repeater data set: this contains 24608 raw voltage and 1066 reduced ﬁlterbank ﬁles (each scan
of about 70 raw data ﬁles reduces into the three standard 3 ﬁlterbank ﬁles, hence the disparity in amounts).
This data set is presented unspliced - each data product represents 187.5MHz of the total bandwidth.

• HDF5 data for everything analyzed in Enriquez et al. (2017) and Price et al. (submitted): all the HFD5 data
currently available are ﬁne frequency resolution products used in the SETI analysis of these papers, as well as
the other standard resolutions.

• APF FITS image data: all the data of this format are from the entire Automated Planet Finder survey, and is

continually growing.

A list of the larger/notable data sets available in this data release are listed in Table 9. You can ﬁnd data from any
of these catagories by searching for target names that begin with the listed substrings. For example, all the Hipparcos
star catalog targets begin with the substring “HIP.”
