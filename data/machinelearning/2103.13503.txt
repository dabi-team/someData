Abstract 

Two-dimensional (2D) ZrS2 monolayer (ML) has emerged as a promising candidate for 

thermoelectric  (TE)  device  applications  due  to  its  high  TE  figure  of  merit,  which  is  mainly 

contributed by its inherently low lattice thermal conductivity. This work investigates the effect of 

the  lattice  anharmonicity  driven  by  temperature-dependent  phonon  dispersions  on  thermal 

transport of ZrS2 ML. The calculations are based on the self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory to 

calculate the thermodynamic parameters along with the lattice thermal conductivity. The higher-

order (quartic) force constants were extracted by using an efficient compressive sensing lattice 

dynamics technique, which estimates the necessary data based on the emerging machine learning 

program  as  an  alternative  of  computationally  expensive  density  functional  theory  calculations. 

Resolve  of  the  degeneracy  and  hardening  of  the  vibrational  frequencies  of  low-energy  optical 

modes were predicted upon including the quartic anharmonicity. As compared to the conventional 

Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) approach, the lattice thermal conductivity of the optimized 

ZrS2 ML unit cell within SCP + BTE approach is found to be significantly enhanced (e.g., by 21% 

at 300 K). This enhancement is due to the relatively lower value of phonon linewidth contributed 

by  the  anharmonic  frequency  renormalization  included  in  the  SCP  theory.  Mainly,  the 

conventional BTE approach neglects the temperature dependence of the phonon frequencies due 

to the consideration of harmonic lattice dynamics and treats the normal process of three-phonon 

scattering incorrectly due to the use of quasi-particle lifetimes. These limitations are addressed in 

this  work  within  the  SCP  +  BTE  approach,  which  signifies  the  validity  and  accuracy  of  this 

approach.

1.  Introduction 

It is well known that atoms in real crystals are not fixed at rigid lattice sites but vibrating from 

their equilibrium position. Lattice vibrations play a vital role in describing the thermal properties 

of  crystalline  solids  by  means  of  scattering  in  charge  transports.  The  density  functional  theory 

(DFT) based on the standard harmonic approximation (HA) has been routine nowadays to study 

the phonon dispersion relations and several thermodynamical properties [1–4]. The HA is based 

on the second-order derivative of the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) energy surface around the ionic 

equilibrium, where the atomic displacements are considered sufficiently small compared to the 

interatomic  distances.  The  HA  is  a  useful  technique  to  describe  the  elastic  properties,  phonon 

spectra  and  lattice  vibrations  of  a  crystal  at  0  K.  However,  the  lattice  anharmonicity  and 

temperature  dependences  of  phonon,  which  play  a  key  role  to  explain  the  lattice  thermal 

conductivity  (LTC)  and  thermal  expansion  in  solids,  cannot  be  accounted  within  the  harmonic 

limit. In particular, the HA fails in the crystals that have significant anharmonic effects and for the 

materials that are dynamically unstable at 0 K. 

The  consistent  explanation  of  equilibrium  properties  in  crystals  and  the  limited  thermal 

conductivity of an insulating solid requires the presence of anharmonic terms [5], which include 

the cubic and higher-order terms in the energy expansion. Anharmonic effects are useful properties 

in  the  finite  temperature  phonon  dispersion  relation,  phonon-phonon  scattering  rate,  phonon 

lifetime, shift in phonon frequencies, and so on. These parameters play an important role in the 

phonon  transport  mechanism,  which  determines  the  LTC.  The  density  functional  perturbation 

theory  (DFPT)  [6–9]  or  the  finite-displacement  method  [10]  have  been  used  to  treat  the 

anharmonicity. The finite-displacement approach uses the force-displacements data to extract the 

cubic, quartic and higher-order terms. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive 

as the range of the nearest neighboring atomic interaction and the order of anharmonicity increases. 

The DFPT, on the other hand, considers the anharmonic self-energies as a small perturbation of 

the harmonic terms, which is valid only when the anharmonic terms are sufficiently smaller than 

the harmonic term. The high temperature phases of the ferroelectric materials with the dynamical 

instability [11–15] and systems with light atoms (like hydrogen) [16–19] are some examples where 

the  perturbation  theory  is  not  applicable.  Therefore,  a  nonperturbative  approach  is  needed  to 

2 

 
 
 
 
account  the  anharmonic  effects  for  the  emergent  thermoelectric  (TE)  materials  and  hybrid 

perovskite solar cells [13,20–24]. 

Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations based approaches are generally used to 

account the anharmonic effects nonperturbatively [25–27]. However, the underlying problem  here 

is  in  the  Newtonian  dynamics  as  its  application  is  limited    to  the  temperatures  above  Debye 

temperature. In addition, these AIMD based approaches are computationally expensive as well to 

obtain the converged phonon energies [28]. The temperature-dependent effective potential (TDEP) 

is one of the AIMD based approaches, which uses AIMD simulations and extracts the best possible 

harmonic or higher-order potential energy surfaces at finite temperatures [29]. But this approach, 

being an AIMD based, is limited when accounting for the zero-point vibration according to the 

aforementioned problem within the AIMD  simulations. The self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory 

is another useful nonperturbative approach to include the lattice anharmonicity, which considers 

the quantum effect of phonons [30]. An efficient implementation of the SCP theory was developed 

recently [15,31], which inputs the higher-order anharmonic force constants obtained  using the 

compressive sensing lattice dynamics (CSLD) technique [32]. 

Zirconium disulphide (ZrS2) monolayer (ML) is a typical two-dimensional (2D) transition 

metal dichalcogenide that has been successfully synthesized [33–36]. Lowering the dimensionality 

and  nano-structuring  are  reported  to  play  major  roles  in  suppressing  the  LTC  that  leads  to  an 

enhancement in the figure of merit (ZT) [37–41]. As compared to other similar 2D compounds, 

ZrS2 ML is predicted to have a significantly low LTC upon using the conventional Boltzmann 

transport equation (BTE) within the relaxation time approximation (RTA), based on the harmonic 

phonon frequencies at 0 K [21]. In addition, the ZrS2 ML has been predicted to have a higher ZT 

value  of  4.5  at  800  K,  which  is  an  important  result  for  TE  efficiency  enhancement  and  device 

applications. However, the inadequate understanding of the lattice anharmonicity and its effect on 

the phonon dispersion and lattice thermal conductivity can be misleading in revealing the actual 

significance of ZrS2 ML in thermoelectrics. One may wonder how does the lattice anharmonicity 

and finite temperatures affect the lattice dynamics and thermodynamic properties of the ZrS2 ML? 

This important issue has not been examined to date, which is the stimulus of the present work. In 

this  work  we  investigate  the  effect  of  finite-temperature  anharmonic  phonons  on  the  thermal 

transport along with the LTC of the 2D ZrS2 ML. We used an efficient first-principles method 

based  on  the  SCP  theory  [15,31,42,43],  which  calculates  the  temperature-dependent  phonon 

3 

 
 
 
frequencies and LTC using the interatomic force constants (IFCs) within a supercell. The validity 

of this method was also well-demonstrated by carefully comparing the computed numerical results 

with experiments. We present brief details on the theoretical background of this work in section 2. 

The  computational  methods  of  the  calculations  are  provided  in  section  3.  The  main  results 

concerning  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  anharmonic  phonons,  lattice  dynamics, 

thermodynamic  parameters,  and  LTC  are  described  in  section  4.  In  section  5,  the  results  are 

summarized by drawing final conclusions.

Theory  

  According to the BO approximation, the Hamiltonian (H) of an interacting nuclear system can 

be given by the sum of its kinetic energy operator (T) of ions and the potential energy (U) defined 

by the BO energy surface, H = T + U. The potential energy (U) of the system can be expressed as 

a Taylor expansion with respect to the atomic displacements as [15,44]: 

																								𝑈 = 	𝑈$ + 	𝑈& + 	𝑈’ + 	𝑈( + 	 …	,                                                  (1)

is  the  nth-order  (n  =  2,  3,  …,  ∞)    contribution  to  the  potential  energy,  𝑢/(𝑙𝑘)  is  the  atomic 

displacement  of

𝛷/0,...,/3(𝑙+𝑘+; 	 … ; 	𝑙*𝑘*) represents the nth-order, or n-bodies, IFC, which is obtained by the nth-
order derivative of the potential energy with respect to the atomic displacements.  In Eq. (1) above, 

the  linear  term  U1  is  neglected  as  the  atomic  forces  are  zero  in  equilibrium.  In  the  HA,  the 

expansion in Eq. (1) is truncated at the second order. The Hamiltonian here is transformed into 

Fourier  space  and  then  the  harmonic  phonon  frequency  𝜔  is  computed  by  constructing  and 

diagonalizing the dynamical matrix. 

The anharmonic contribution to the energy is generally expressed as a small perturbation 

𝐻F added to the harmonic Hamiltonian (H0 = T + U0 + U2 ) as [15,31,45,46]: 

𝐻 = 	 𝐻$ + 	 𝐻F 	 ≈ 	 𝐻$ + 	 𝑈’ + 	𝑈(,                                       (3) 
where the higher order terms (n > 4) are omitted considering their contributions much smaller as 

compared to the third- and fourth-order terms. However, if the anharmonic terms are significant 

and comparable to the harmonic terms, they should be treated nonperturbatively. Using the SCP 

4 

 
 
 
theory  [15,31,47–49],  which  treats  the  anharmonic  renormalization  of  the  phonon  frequencies 

nonperturbatively, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (3) can be re-written as: 

																		𝐻 = 	 ℋ$ + (𝐻$ − 	 ℋ$ + 	 𝑈’ + 	𝑈() = 	 ℋ$ + 	 ℋF,                                     (4) 

where  ℋ$  (=  +

  )  is  the  effective  harmonic  Hamiltonian  associated  with  the 

displacement operator ΛL,	ΩL is the renormalized anharmonic phonon frequency, ℏ is the reduced 

Planck’s constant, and q is the crystal momentum vector. 

The free energy of the system can be obtained as the cumulant expansion of the term ℋF and the 

variational principle can be applied following the first-order SCP theory [31,43]. Then, the SCP 

equation can be derived as:

the iteration process of the SCP equation, the interpolation is performed using q mesh within q1 

mesh for the inner loop. 

3. 

Computational details 

First-principles DFT calculations were performed by employing the VASP package [50,51], 

where  the  generalized  gradient  approximation  (GGA)  was  used  by  applying  the  projector 

augmented  wave  method  with  the  Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof  (PAW-PBE)  functional  [52].  The 

primitive unit cell of the 2D ZrS2 ML was fully optimized within the self-consistent field loop 

convergence criteria of 10-6 eV. A cut-off energy of 500 eV and a Monkhorst-Pack k-mesh of 18 

×  18  ×  1  was  used  including  the  van  der  Waals  interactions  [53].  The  atomic  plane  and  its 

neighboring images were separated by a sufficiently large vacuum of 22 Å in the z-direction to 

avoid interactions between the mirror images during the DFT calculations. The electronic band 

structure calculations were also performed prior the lattice dynamics calculations. 

5 

 
 
A  5  ×  5  ×  1  supercell  of  ZrS2  ML  containing  75  atoms  were  used  to  extract  the  IFCs.  To 

extract the harmonic IFCs, the finite-displacement approach was used. In this approach each atom 

was  displaced  from  its  equilibrium  position  by  0.01  Å  including  all  possible  nearest  neighbor 

interactions. For the cubic IFCs, we considered up to the five-body nearest neighboring atomic 

interaction. The atomic forces on each of the displaced configurations were calculated, and then 

the cubic IFCs were extracted by using the ordinary least squares (OLS) fitting method with the 

harmonic IFCs as implemented in ALAMODE package [15,31,43,54]. A fitting error of  0.11 % 

was found here. 

To estimate the IFC for the higher (quartic, or higher) order terms, the usual finite displacement 

method requires a large number (more than 5,000) of DFT calculations to get the atomic forces, 

which  is  computationally  expensive.  So,  the  quartic  IFCs  were  extracted  by  using  the  CSLD 

technique [32], which is based on the machine learning programs as discussed and implemented 

in Refs. [15,31]. A 5 × 5 × 1 supercell of ZrS2 ML was initially used to conduct AIMD simulations 

at 300 K for 14,000 MD steps with a time step of 1.5 fs. From the trajectory of AIMD simulations, 

50  equally  spaced  atomic  configurations  were  extracted.  All  the  atoms  in  each  of  the  atomic 

configurations were then displaced by 0.1 Å in random directions.  The atomic forces were then 

calculated  for  these  configurations  using  the  DFT  calculations.  These  calculated  atomic  forces 

were then used to estimate the quartic IFCs based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection 

operator (LASSO) technique [55], which solves the following equation: 

													𝚽d = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 	𝑚𝑖𝑛Q	 ∥ 𝔸𝜱 − 	ℱnop ∥&

&	+ 	𝛼 ∥ 𝜱 ∥+.                                   (7) 

Here, L1 regularization term is added to the least-squares method, Φ = [Φ+, Φ&, … , Φs]p is the 
vector composed of M linearly independent IFCs, ℱnop is the vector of atomic forces, and 𝔸 is the 

matrix of atomic displacements. Moreover, 𝛼 stands for the hyperparameter that controls the trade-

off between the sparsity and accuracy of the model, whose optimal value was chosen from the 

cross-validation  (CV)  technique.  The  second  order  (harmonic)  IFCs  were  fixed  to  the  values 

obtained  by  OLS  method  and  anharmonic  terms  were  optimized  during  the  LASSO  regression 

step. The estimated quartic IFCs were used to calculate the anharmonic phonon frequency (ΩL) 

after solving Eqs. (5) and (6).  

The thermodynamic parameters here can be evaluated as a function of the renormalized 

anharmonic frequency (ΩL). The specific heat capacity (Cv) can be calculated as:

where 𝑁L is the number of q-points. 

The LTC, which is an important parameter that contributes to the TE efficiency, can be 

computed generally by using the BTE within RTA as [31,56]:

theory is used to overcome this limitation, in which the LTC is modified as [15,31]:

processes.

Results and discussions 

4.1.    Structural and electronic properties 

The 2D ZrS2 ML is found to crystallize in 1T structure (space group 𝑝3(cid:146)𝑚1) as shown in 

figure  1(a),  where  each  Zr  atom  is  octahedrally  coordinated  by  six  S  atoms  within  the  S-Zr-S 

sandwich layers. The unit cell of ZrS2 ML is composed of three atoms (two Zr atoms and one S 

atom)  with  lattice  parameters  of  a1  =  a2 =  3.69  Å  separated  by  angle  of  120°.  This  result  is  in 

agreement with the previous experimental and theoretical results [21,33,34,57–59]. The electronic 

structure calculations predicted an indirect band gap where the valence band maximum (VBM) 

and conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at Γ and M points, respectively, as shown in 

figure 1(b). The band gap value is found to be 1.13 eV, without including the spin-orbit interaction 

(SOI), which remains almost the same (1.14 eV) upon including the SOI, see figure 1(b). These 

results are in agreement with previous studies [21,58,60,61]. The Brillouin zone with the selected 

high symmetry points for the electronic band structure calculation is shown in figure 1(c).

4.2.   Anharmonic force constants from the compressive sensing technique 

While the cubic terms are needed to perform the BTE calculations, the harmonic and quartic 

IFCs are necessary inputs to conduct the SCP calculations. The aforementioned LASSO technique 

was adopted to estimate the quartic IFCs, where the 50 displacement-force data sets obtained using 

AIMD are used. The predictive accuracy of LASSO regression was tested beforehand by using a 

four-fold  cross-validation  (CV)  technique.  The  results  of  the  CV  are  shown  in  figure  2,  where 

figure  2(a)  represents  the  relative  error  of  the  atomic  forces,  defined  as  a  square  root  of  ∥
𝔸Φd − 	ℱnop ∥&
the CV error decreases and reaches its minimum value at 𝛼 = 4.96 × 10-6 as indicated by the dotted 

&, as a function of the hyperparameter 𝛼. As the value of 𝛼 decreases, 

&/∥ 	ℱnop ∥&

vertical line in the figure. This value of 𝛼 was chosen for the estimation of quartic IFCs because it 

is expected to give an accurate prediction for the data sets. With the chosen 𝛼 value, we obtained 

a total of 9134 non-zero quartic IFCs as shown in figure 2(b), which represents about 55% of the 

total number of quartic IFCs with the rest of the physically irrelevant IFCs driven to be exactly 

zero. 

4.3.    Self-consistent phonons at finite temperature 

Phonons are the vibrations resulting from the thermal energy of atoms or molecules within a 

system. The phonon dispersion curves and density of states (DOS) of ZrS2 ML within the HA and 

SCP approach are shown in figure 3. Sufficiently converged anharmonic phonon frequencies (ΩL) 

were found with a 5 × 5 × 1 q-grid points with respect to the intermediate 10 × 10 × 2 q1-grid 

points.  The  non-analytic  correction  was  included  by  employing  the  Born  effective  charges  and 

dielectric constants during SCP calculations. As the ZrS2 unit cell has 3 atoms, there are a total of 

9 phonon modes (3 acoustic and 6 optical), see figure 3(a). The lowest 3 phonon modes represent 

the  acoustic  modes,  which  are  composed  of  in-plane  longitudinal  acoustic  (LA),  in-plane 

transverse acoustic (TA) modes, and out-of-plane flexural acoustic (ZA) mode. While LA and TA 

modes have a linear behavior near the Γ point, the ZA mode exhibits a quadratic behavior, which 

is due to the 2D nature ML structure [37,62]. This behavior is consistent with the results obtained 

for  other  two-dimensional  materials  such  as  graphene[4,63–65],  boron  nitride  [66,67],  silicene 

[68], InX (Sn, Se, and Te)[69], and MoSe2 [70]. The phonon frequencies of low-energy optical 

modes of ZrS2 ML are found to increase within the SCP approach, which is due to the included 

8 

 
 
 
quartic IFCs as shown in Eq. (5). The harmonic phonon frequency of the lower optical mode at Γ 

point is 145.36 cm-1, which increases to 152.57 cm-1 by including the quartic anharmonicity within 

the SCP approach at 0 K. The frequency further increases to 162.55 cm-1 at 300 K temperature due 

to  the  temperature  dependent  term	𝐼L  within  the  SCP  calculations  (see  Eqs.  (5)  and  (6)).  The 

degeneracy of the optical modes 4 and 5 at the Γ point in the case of the harmonic phonon spectra 

is  broken  by  the  inclusion  of  the  quartic  anharmonicity  within  the  SCP  method,  where  the 

frequency of the optical mode 5 increases as seen in figure 3(a) with the corresponding phonon 

frequencies provided in table 1. This resolve of the degeneracy and hardening of the optical modes 

within SCP approach highlights the particular importance of the lattice anharmonicity for ZrS2, 

which is expected to affect the LTC later. The phonon DOS as a function of vibrational frequency 

are depicted in figure 3(b), where the higher peaks in the phonon DOS are found at the frequency 

region beyond 200 cm-1. This can be attributed to the fact that the number of the lighter S atom, 

which contributes to the higher frequency, is double than that of the heavier Zr atom in the ZrS2 

ML unit cell. 

4.4.  Thermodynamic parameters 

The  specific  heat  capacity  (Cv)  is  a  crucial  thermodynamic  quantity,  which  directly 

contributes to the LTC (𝜅9) as 𝜅9  ∝ Cv. The calculated Cv as a function of temperature obtained 

within the SCP theory is shown in figure 4(a). The low values of Cv at temperatures below 400 K 

indicate smaller contributions to LTC at low temperatures. The value of Cv is found to increase as 

a function of the temperature until it converges to the classical limit of Dulong and Petit at higher 

temperatures. The mean-square displacement (MSD) is an important quantity that measures the 

deviation of atoms with respect to the equilibrium position in a system. The average MSD tensor 

of atom k is computed as:

,                                     (11) 

where 𝑒/(cid:133)𝑘; 𝑞~(cid:135) is the corresponding atomic polarization. 

There  is  an  increase  in  the  MSDs  upon  increasing  the  temperature,  which  is  ascribed  to  the 

increased heating effect at higher temperatures, see figure 4(b). The increase in MSDs of thermal 

vibrations at higher temperature contributes to reduce the thermal transport. The calculated MSDs 

of S atoms are found to be higher than those of Zr atoms because of the higher atomic mass of Zr 

9 

 
 
atoms  and  the  inverse  relation  between  atomic  displacement  and  mass,  see  Eq.  (11).  This 

phenomena  becomes  more  pronounced  as  the  temperature  increases.  The  total  vibrational  free 

energy is given by the sum of the free energy within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) 

and the SCP correction term due to the anharmonicity within SCP method (ETotal = EQHA + ESCP). 

Although there is a negligible effect of SCP correction to the free energy within QHA at lower 

temperatures, the effect becomes more pronounced as the temperature increases as shown in figure 

4(c). For instance, the SCP correction energy of -2.2 meV at 300 K decreases to -7.8 meV at 700 

K.  This  decrease  in  total  energy  using  the  SCP  correction  indicates  that  the  system  is  more 

stabilized by including the quartic anharmonicity. This fact also clearly highlights the importance 

of the anharmonic frequency renormalization on the thermal properties. 

The  phonon  mode-dependent  Grüneisen  parameter  (𝛾L~) 

is  another 

important 

dimensionless quantity that measures the anharmonic nature of the structure. This parameter is 

evaluated as the change of phonon frequency (𝜔L~ or ΩL) with respect to the change in volume 

(V): 𝛾L~ = 	 −

(cid:137)((cid:154)(cid:155)(cid:156)	(cid:157)Tx)
(cid:137)((cid:154)(cid:155)(cid:156)	(cid:158))

 by using the cubic IFCs. A positive value of 𝛾L~ indicates a decrease in the 

frequency of the phonon mode q,j with the increase of volume. The calculated 𝛾L~ of ZrS2 ML as 

a function of the phonon frequency is shown in figure 5(a), where the trend of change in 𝛾L~ values 

for both the SCP and harmonic lattice dynamics is found to be similar. The larger negative value 

of 𝛾L~ in the low frequency region (acoustic phonon modes) changes to small positive values at 

higher  frequencies.  This  suggests  larger  phonon  anharmonicity  in  the  case  of  acoustic  phonon 

modes. This nature closely affects the LTC via phonon life time (𝜏) as  𝜏L~

R+ 	 ∝ 	 𝛾L~

&  according to 

the continuum theory [71,72].  

The  cumulative  phonon  group  velocities  (vg)  of  ZrS2  ML  as  a  function  of  the  phonon 

frequency is illustrated in figure 5(b). On average, group velocities of the acoustic phonon modes 

are  found  to  be  higher  than  those  of  the  optical  phonons.  The  average  group  velocities  of  the 

acoustic  and  optical  phonons  within  the  harmonic  (SCP)  lattice  dynamics  are  1.84  kms-1  (1.83 

kms-1)  and  1.1  kms-1  (1.05  kms-1),  respectively.  Hence,  following  the  relation  𝜅9 	 ∝ 	 𝑣(cid:159),	the 

contribution of the acoustic phonon modes to the LTC should be larger than that of optical modes.   

The phonon lifetime (𝜏) is another significant quantity that is related to the LTC as 𝜅9 ∝  𝜏 

(see  Eqs.  (9)  and  (10)).  It  is  calculated  from  the  imaginary  part  of  the  anharmonic  self-energy 

(∑ (𝜔L)
L

)  as  𝜏L,(cid:160)*¡

R+ = 	2ΓL

(cid:160)*¡ = 2𝐼𝑚 ∑ (𝜔L)

L

  [15,31,43],  where  ΓL

(cid:160)*¡  is  the  phonon  linewidth. 

10 

 
 
Figure 5(c) shows the calculated 𝜏 of ZrS2 ML at 300 K as a function of the phonon vibrational 

frequency by using the harmonic and SCP lattice dynamics, where the harmonic phonon frequency 

(𝜔L) is replaced by renormalized phonon frequency (ΩL) for the SCP lattice dynamics. The longer 

phonon  lifetime  is  found  in  the  low  frequency  range  (acoustic  modes)  due  to  the  low  phonon-

phonon scattering rate. This means the low frequency phonon modes have the major contribution 

to transport most of the heat in ZrS2 ML, and consequently, a significant contribution to the LTC. 

As the obtained quasi-particle 𝜏 values by harmonic phonons are used in usual BTE approach, 

where the normal process of three-phonon scattering is incorrectly treated—this would result in 
‘p(cid:129)< 𝜅9
𝜅9
higher than that of the harmonic phonons (1.59 ps) used in BTE approach, which is ascribed to the 

(cid:160)¢£⁄(cid:160)9 [31] as a consequence. The average value of  𝜏 using the SCP approach (2.24 ps) is 

three-phonon scattering processes included within the SCP lattice dynamics. 

4.5.      Lattice thermal conductivity 

The  LTC  (𝜅9)  spectrum  as  a  function  of  the  vibrational  frequency  and  contributions  of 

different phonon branches to 𝜅9  for the optimized unit cell of ZrS2 ML are shown in figure 6. The 
low energy phonons below 160 cm-1 are found to account for about 91% (94%) of the total 𝜅9 

value  within  BTE  (SCP  +  BTE)  method  at  300  K.  The  increase  in  cumulative  𝜅9  becomes 
negligible  above  the  phonon  frequency  of  160  cm-1  indicating  the  major  contribution  of  the 

acoustic  modes  to  𝜅9.  The  significant  decrease  of  𝜅9  values  above  160  cm-1  is  attributed  to  the 
increase in the available three-phonon scattering phase space (SPS), which describes the number 

of scattering channels available for a phonon. In ZrS2 ML system, the three-phonon SPS at 300 K 

increases  upon  increasing  the  phonon  frequency  (above  160  cm-1  as  shown  in  figure  S1, 

Supplemental  Material),  which  corresponds  to  the  subsequently  lower  𝜅9  [73,74]  thereby 

increasing the available scattering channels. The three phonon SPS values for absorption processes 

at  300  K  reach  to  its  minimum  at  higher  frequencies  (figure  S1,  Supplemental  Material).  In 

contrast, the SPS values for emission processes reach the peak at higher frequencies for both the 

harmonic and SCP methods. The contribution of different phonon branches to LTC is shown in 

figure  6(b).  The  low-energy  acoustic  phonon  modes  (branch  1  to  3)  are  found  to  have  major 

contributions to the 𝜅9 values than the higher-energy optical modes (branch 4 to 9). In specific, the 

phonon branch 2 (branch 3) is found to have the highest contribution to 𝜅9 within BTE (SCP + 

BTE) approach. 

11 

 
 
Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of LTC (𝜅9) values of the DFT optimized unit 

cell of ZrS2 ML calculated by using the conventional BTE and SCP + BTE approaches. The LTC 

calculations  were  performed  using  a  sufficiently  high  60  ×  60  ×  1  q-grid  points  with  the 

neighboring images separated by a sufficiently large vacuum of 22 Å in the z-direction for both the 

BTE and SCP + BTE methods. The value of 𝜅9 is found to decrease with increasing temperature, 
in line with the standard relation 𝜅9 ∝ T-1. This behavior is ascribed to the increase in the phonon 
(cid:160)*¡) (see figure S2, Supplemental Material) at higher temperatures, which is simply 

linewidth (ΓL

related to the increase in the BE distribution function with the temperature that leads to an increase 

in  the  scattering  probability.  The  anisotropy  in  LTC  values  between  the  zigzag  and  armchair 

directions is appreciably enhanced within the SCP + BTE approach as illustrated in figure 7, which 

is attributed to the increase in the lattice anharmonicity upon the inclusion of the quartic IFCs.  

The calculated average 𝜅9 value of ZrS2 ML at 300 K using the BTE method is 3.19 Wm-1K-1 (3.16 
Wm-1K-1  along  zigzag  direction  and  3.22  Wm-1K-1  along  armchair  direction),  which  is  in 

agreement with the recently reported result of 3.29 Wm-1K-1 [21] obtained within the BTE method.  

The predicted 𝜅9 value of ZrS2 ML in this work is found to be lower than that of bulk ZrS2 along 

the in-plane direction, but higher as compared to that along the cross-plane direction [72], see table 

2. It is remarkable that the calculated 𝜅9 values by SCP + BTE method are found to be relatively 

higher than those obtained by the conventional BTE method. At 300K, the average 𝜅9 value of 
ZrS2 ML by using SCP + BTE approach is found to be 3.85 Wm-1K-1 (4.28 Wm-1K-1 along zigzag 

direction and 3.39 Wm-1K-1 along armchair direction), which is higher than the BTE value by 21%. 

A deeper insight into the origin of the difference in 𝜅9 can be obtained by comparing the calculated 
(cid:160)*¡) within the BTE and SCP + BTE approaches (see figure S2, Supplemental 

phonon linewidth (ΓL

Material), where 𝜅9 ∝ (ΓL

(cid:160)*¡)R+ as discussed above. The lower value of ΓL

(cid:160)*¡ within SCP + BTE 

approach  (which  uses  SCP  lattice  dynamics)  than  that  within  the  BTE  approach  (which  uses 

harmonic  lattice  dynamics)  leads  to  a  higher  LTC  value  for  the  SCP  +  BTE  approach 

(𝜅9

(cid:141)(cid:142)(cid:143)W‘p(cid:129) 	 > 𝜅9

‘p(cid:129)). These outcomes are in line with previous studies [15,31,42] that predicted 

the anharmonic lattice dynamics properties of cubic SrTiO3 and SCF3  using SCP + BTE approach, 

where  the  calculated  results  using  SCP  +  BTE  approach  were  found  to  agree  well  with  the 

experimental results. Most crucially, the usual BTE approach neglects the temperature dependence 

of the phonon frequencies as it takes only the harmonic phonon frequencies into account. With 

these  all  facts,  the  𝜅9  value  calculated  using  the  SCP  +  BTE  approach  is  expected  to  be  more 

12 

 
 
accurate, and helps to predict reliable TE figure of merit value and energy conversion efficiency. 

The prediction should be validated by a future experimental study. 

5. 

Conclusion 

The lattice dynamical properties of 2D ZrS2 ML are investigated using the SCP theory. The 

CSLD  technique  has  proven  to  be  a  useful  approach,  as  an  alternative  of  the  computationally 

expensive  DFT  calculations,  to  estimate  the  higher  order  anharmonic  IFCs.  The  temperature-

dependent  phonon  frequencies  renormalized  with  the  quartic  anharmonicity  are  calculated 

nonperturbatively  based  on  the  SCP  approach.  The  frequency  renormalization  phenomenon  is 

found to be more pronounced at the low-energy optical modes. The LTC value obtained using the 

SCP  +  BTE  approach  is  enhanced  as  compared  to  that  predicted  using  the  conventional  BTE 

method. This is attributed to the relatively lower phonon linewidth due to the anharmonic phonon 

frequency  renormalization  phenomena  included  within  the  SCP  theory.  The  conventional  BTE 

approach  i)  neglects  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  phonon  frequencies  due  to  the 

consideration of harmonic lattice dynamics and ii) the normal process of three-phonon scattering 

is incorrectly treated due to the use of quasi-particle lifetimes. These limitations are addressed in 

this  work  within  the  SCP  +  BTE  approach,  which  indicate  the  validity  and  accuracy  of  the 

approach.  We  expect  that  the  present  work  not  only  correct  the  𝜅9  value  of  ZrS2 ML  reported 

previously but also provides an insight to explain the effect of phonon anharmonicity on the lattice 

dynamics and thermodynamic properties. The effect of anharmonic frequency renormalization on 

the lattice dynamics of similar ultralow-LTC 2D materials followed by the experimental findings 

could  be  interesting  future  works  regarding  the  TE  efficiency  measurement  and  device 

applications.
