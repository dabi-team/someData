Abstract

The Monte Carlo for lepton pair production and τ decays consist of KKMC for lepton pair production,

tauola for τ lepton decays and photos for radiative corrections in decays.

An eﬀort for adaptation of the system for precision data to be collected at Belle II experiment lead to
extension of phase space generation modules both in photos and tauola to enable decays and/or radiative
corrections of additional light lepton pairs. The phase-space and matrix element parts of the programs are
separated, that is why extension to processes where lepton pair is produced through narrow resonances,
like dark photon, was straight forward.

In the present version of tauola, list of τ decay channels is enriched with multitude of exotic ones, useful
for searches of new physics. The hadronic currents parametrizations of main decay channels is prepared for
basic simulation in the experiment. The basis for future work on precise ﬁts of hadronic currents including
Machine Learning is retained, but development of necessary software solutions is left for the forthcoming
years.

Presented programs versions are available in stand-alone format from gitlab or through the basf2
system of Belle II software. Oﬃcial distribution web pages, documenting programs tests, are retained but
not necessarily up to the date.

1 Introduction

Technical aspects:

phase

space presamplers

The tauola package [1, 2, 3, 4] for simulation of τ -
lepton decays and photos [5, 6, 7] for simulation of
QED radiative corrections in decays, are computing
projects with a rather long history. Written and
maintained by well-deﬁned principal authors, they
nonetheless migrated into a wide range of applica-
tions where they became essential ingredients of com-
plicated simulation chains. In the following, we shall
concentrate on version of the programs which are pre-
pared for installation in basf2 software of the Belle II
experiment. The following programs are installed in
the system: (i) KKMC for the τ lepton production pro-
cess e−e+ → τ −τ +nγ (ii) tauola for τ lepton decays,
(iii) photos for bremsstrahlung in decays of parti-
cles and resonances, (iv) photospp, the C++ version
of photos, which at present is used only for supple-
menting events with lepton pairs, produced through
virtual careers of the electroweak interaction in the
Standard Model or through New Physics processes.

Our presentation is organized as follows: Section 2
is devoted to technical changes prepared in Ref. [8]
for tauola and earlier in Ref. [9] for photos. These
extensions of phase space generators, enable not only
full implementation of bremsstrahlung-like processes
where virtual photon decay into pair of leptons, but
also the possibilities of emitting dark photon or dark
scalars, now introduced into tauola and photospp.
In Section 3 we concentrate on photos Monte Carlo
for radiative corrections in decays. The new ver-
sion of the program features emissions of light lep-
ton pairs, which may originate from virtual pho-
ton or from dark photons or scalars. Numerical
tests of dark scalar implementation into KKMC [10]
e−e+ → τ −τ +nγ event samples are presented. Sec-
tion 4 is devoted to the discussion of initialization for
tauola hadronic currents and new decay channels as
prepared for basf2 of Belle II. This point was already
announced in [11] and presented in [12], that is why,
we will address only those points which may be im-
portant for the future users. Section 5 summarizes
this proceeding.

From technical point of view, the most important up-
date was the introduction of phase space presamplers
for lepton pairs originating from virtual photon or
narrow exotic resonances, either vector or scalar in
nature. Both tauola and photos rely on exact phase
space parametrizations. In principle, results of simu-
lations also depend on parameterization of matrix el-
ements and/or form factors used, but if presamplers
of phase-space are not appropriate, eﬃciency of gen-
eration is poor and in extreme cases the distributions
may be unreliable. Usually the weight monitoring
functionalities point to the diﬃculties.
In fact, the
necessity of changes can be identiﬁed from inspection
of matrix elements to be installed. Details for the case
of lepton pairs can be found in Ref. [8] and are not re-
peated here. What is important, is that phase space
parametrizations in both tauola and photospp now
have presamplers for virtual photon or narrow reso-
nances decaying to lepton pairs.

Once matrix element installed and distributions
generated, it is necessary to perform tests. Semi-
analytical, or analytical results for pair emissions are
rare, but nonetheless were reported in Ref. [8] and
[11]. These numerical results are mostly about ﬁnal
state rates and rely on eikonal approximations for
matrix elements. Pair emission can be also gener-
ated with other generators. That was used for test
already long time ago. Automated comparison pack-
age MC-TESTER [13] was used to construct histograms
and compare results from KORALW [14] with those from
photos in tandem with KKMC. Such tests are very
helpful. We have used them in study of CP sensitive
observables in H → τ τ channel [15], where events
simulated with tauola universal interface [16]
are compared with those including parity eﬀects in-
troduced with the tauspinner algorithm [17]. For τ τ
jet jet such test and comparisons with MadGraph [18]
are reported in [19]. Now events simulated with
photos were compared with events simulated with
MadGraph for the e−e+ → τ −τ +X (X → l¯l) pro-
cess, where X is an exotic particle motivated by new
physics models, and can be vector Z ′ [20, 21] or dark

1

scalar [22]. The spin state of τ ﬂips when X is scalar,
which needs to be taken into account in proper sim-
ulation of τ − τ spin correlations. For these develop-
ments, distributions prepared with MC-TESTER were
obtained, and used in the developmenent of tauola
and photospp.

3 PHOTOS Monte Carlo

for
bremsstrahlung and lepton
pair emission

Numerical tests for pair emission algorithm are pub-
lished [23], and following updates on the program pre-
sented in [9]. This update opened up new possibil-
ities, in particular, generation of lepton pairs in the
process e−e+ → τ −τ +nγ with τ decays and imple-
mentation into ﬁnal state of an exotic particle X mo-
tivated by new physics. There are two reasons, why
matrix elements of refs [20, 21, 22] could not be used
directly. First is to preserve modularity of photos
Monte Carlo design. Second is because the matrix
element form must enable its interpolation for use
when additional bremsstrahlung photons are present.
That is why a factorized form, with the emission fac-
tor similar to the eikonal one, was necessary to be
devised and checked for the process shown in Fig. 1.
In QED, the eikonal factor is the diﬀerence be-
tween amplitude of some scattering process and the
one when additional soft photon is present. If there
are many photons in ﬁnal states and all are at small
energies, products of such factors, are added. In the
soft photon limit, each such factor depends only on
momenta of outgoing and incoming charged particles
and on the momentum of the photon. The result-
2pµ
ing formula is quite simple Pcharged particles Qi
i
2pi·k
and well known. What is important is that it can
be expressed with four momenta and can be used all
over the phase space. One should not forget it is
the zeroth level approximation, and thus, corrections
obtained from matrix element calculations are neces-
sary. This is essential element of exclusive exponen-
tiation for photon generation in KKMC [10] or photos.
Hard photon conﬁguration corrections in general de-
pend on momenta of all photons in a particular event.

The QED matrix elements for conﬁgurations with
addtional lepton pairs has a similar form if lepton
pair virtuality and energies are small. In this case,
the emission factor is process independent, and has a
form which can be used all over the phase space. In
photospp variant of Eq. 1 from [24] is used.

For conﬁgurations where lepton pairs from decay of
exotic scalars or vector particles are present, approx-
imate matrix elements were derived, following edu-
cated guesses. The approximations were then vali-
dated with MadGraph simulation [18] samples. The
best of several variants was chosen. This opened up
the gateway for simultaneous inclusion of large QED
eﬀects, e.g. ISR as impemented in KKMC. ISR eﬀects
were incorported in MadGraph simulation using the
recipe from [25].

In fact, not only test with MadGraph simulation [18]
samples were necessary. Several iteration of photos

2

matrix elements were performed to achieve better a
simulation tool. Validations and choices were per-
formed with the help of MC-TESTER Shape Diﬀerence
Parameter. Final validation of photos was the check
on the distributions of the recoil mass of the τ -pair
system for the process e−e+ → τ −τ +φDark Scalar,
where the φDark Scalar decays into a pair of oppositely
charged electrons or muons, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

ton pair emissions in decays of resonances or parti-

due to QED interactions or due to dark photon or
dark scalars.

The photospp generation can be combined with
KKMC+tauola+photos.f one. For the sake of rapid
developments, photospp was not used for photon
emissions. This enable more ﬂexibility and some
testing could be spared. The photospp is used for
construction of ﬁnal states of the type Z/γ∗ →
τ τ X(scalar/pseudoscalar/vector/γ∗) with usual τ
decays and with full τ τ spin correlations and with
X → ee(µµ) decays too.

Let us indicate some technical foundations in the
following. The partial width of the decay of a reso-
nance or particle to an intermediate state of n ﬁnal
state particles, is given by the following formula:

dΓ =

1
2M

| ¯Mn|2dLipsn =

1
2M

| ¯Mn|2Jn

kn

Y
j=1

dxj, (1)

where M denotes the mass of the decaying object,
¯Mn denotes the decay matrix element and dLipsn
denotes the Lorentz invariant phase space integration
element. The dLipsn can be expressed, after change
of variables, as a product of integration elements dxj,
of the xj real integration variables in the [0,1] range.
Finally Jn denotes Jacobian of the variable change.
This formula is used in photos. Formally speaking, it
is used twice, ﬁrst for the n-body decay of input parti-
cle, where the xj vector is recovered from the event to
be modiﬁed by photos. Then the set of {xj} is sup-
plemented with additional x′
j to complement the set
of coordinates necessary to parametrize n+1 or n+2
body phase space. These are ﬁnally used for con-

Status of tauola Monte Carlo
initializations

We do not aim at repeating, this what was already
documented in Ref. [23] and in references therein,
but we concentrate on recent changes, introduced for
Belle II applications.

For simulations in the Belle II software, a large
number of channels was prepared to establish de-
faults:

1. Total number of decay channels: 278

2. 2 body neutrinoless non SM decays: 58

3. 3 body neutrinoless non SM decays: 46

4. Number of generic SM decay channels : 92, ini-
tialized with PDG Branching Fractions [27]. For
matrix elements, choices from older versions of
parametrizations were taken, except:

(a) for high precision data obtained for τ − →
π−π0ντ decays [28] by the Belle collabo-
ration, and for τ − → π−π+π−ντ decays
by the BaBar collaboration using the Reso-
nance Chiral Lagrangian initialization [29].
(b) Theoretical uncertainty of models is worse
than quality of data. That is why, new, or
alternative decay modes can be installed by
the user with the help of specially prepared
for that routines but must be validated by
experimental data. User can choose de-
cay product ﬂavours, their masses, as well
as matrix element or hadronic current and
tune it to data in the future. Note that tem-
porarily this option inactive, pending nec-
essary arrangements for basf2 library.

The speaker of this talk (Z.W.) hopes to provide
help with future developements of tauola, perhaps
including reweighting techniques with TauSpinner
weights, originally deployed for the study of spin-
parity of the Higgs Boson, but this time applicable
to the physics of τ decays.

Summary

Final states of τ lepton pairs with bremmstrahlung
photons and dark scalar/photon (decaying to the lep-
ton pair) were introduced for study of e−e+ colli-
sions. The τ pair production and decay were in-
troduced with KKMC and tauola, dark scalar/photon
with photospp. Eﬀorts on τ lepton decays have been
focused on channels, their matrix element and pre-
samplers initializations. Extended list of τ decay
channels is now available in the basf2 software for
the Belle II collaboration, in particular New Physics
neutrinoless ones.

Introductory steps for language change in tauola
are completed. Parts aimed for migration into C are
localized. Parts more convenient for migration into
C++ are separated as well. Evolution is prepared to
