Abstract—Virtual  Reality 

(VR)  head-mounted  displays 
(HMDs)  have  been  studied  widely  as  tools  for  the  most  diverse 
kinds of training activities. One particular kind that  is the basis 
for many real-world applications is spatial knowledge acquisition 
and navigation. For example, knowing well by heart escape routes 
can  be  an  important  factor  for  firefighters  and  soldiers.  Prior 
research  on  how  well  knowledge  acquired  in  virtual  worlds 
translates  to  the  real,  physical  one  has  had  mixed  results,  with 
some suggesting spatial learning in VR is akin to using a regular 
2D  display.  However,  VR  HMDs  have  evolved drastically  in the 
last decade, and little is known about how spatial training skills in 
a simulated environment using up-to-date VR HMDs compare to 
training in the real world. In this paper, we investigate how people 
trained in a VR maze compare against those trained in a physical 
maze  in  terms  of  recall  of  the  position  of  items  inside  the 
environment. While our results did not find significant differences 
in time performance for people who experienced the physical and 
those who trained in VR, other behavioral factors were different.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Google Earth is used to show different places to people who 
cannot go there by themselves.  Given the popularity of online 
exploration used in many fields (e.g., education, travel, design, 
training),  questions  about  people’s  ability  to  recall  the  places 
they visit virtually are of growing importance. For instance, can 
the virtual experience ever create a memory like walking down 
the streets physically? Could people  remember a route if  they 
just  walked  through  it  via  an  application  like  Google  Earth, 
especially in virtual reality (VR)? 

One  technology  that  promises  accessible  training  for  the 
most  various purposes is  VR.  Training  is  arguably one of  the 
most  important  functions  of  VR.  However,  since  VR  is  a 
relatively new technology, there is still much which we do not 
know about it in terms of its effect on memory recall, cognition, 
and knowledge acquisition. For example, high immersion levels 
might  cause  cognitive  overload  [1],  while  lower  levels  of 
immersion  might  lead  people  to  be  discouraged  by  the 
technology  if  they  are  not  engaged  enough.  Similarly,  the 

XXX-X-XXXX-XXXX-X/XX/$XX.00 ©20XX IEEE 

technology  brings  other  inherent  issues,  like  motion-induced 
sickness, that are less prevalent in the physical environment and 
could  negatively impact people’s  ability to make  sense, think, 
and learn [2]–[4]. 

It is important to differentiate a high level of immersion with 
high-level  training  [1].  Most  current  studies  tend  to  focus  on 
higher  levels  of  training  by  exploring  real-life  scenarios  and 
trying to see whether VR can be helpful for these scenarios [5], 
[6]. In this sense, not many studies investigate in-depth how the 
building  blocks  of  learning  compare  in  real  life  versus  in  the 
virtual  environment  [7].  Studies  have  shown  that  when 
navigating a virtual maze, the brain shows higher activity levels 
when the same maze is in 3D rather than in 2D [8]. This finding 
indicates  that  changes  in  visualization  affect  how  spatial 
memory is processed. Since VR is a highly immersive medium, 
it is likely that, when using VR for navigation, information can 
be retained in a similar fashion as in the real world. 

Several aspects of VR can be used to elicit realism, such as 
adding  a virtual  character  [9],  increasing the resolution of  the 
display,  or  allowing  people  to  stay  longer  in  VR  by  using 
different  viewing  perspectives  to  make  their  experience  less 
motion  sick  [10],  [11].  However,  it  is  difficult  to  deeply 
understand the connection between realism and training if we do 
not understand their basis. In this study, we aim to shed some 
light on how similar spatial memory acquisition in VR and real 
life is.  To  this  end,  we  conducted  an  experiment  with  a  maze 
which allowed us to compare both environments and observe if, 
for  short  tasks,  spatial  learning  in  VR  and  real-life  yielded 
similar results.  

II.  RELATED WORK 

A.  Training in VR 

Training is potentially one of the most relevant facets in the 
use  of  VR  HMDs.  Some  studies  explored  their  use  to  train 
people  to  speak  better  towards  audiences  [12]–[14].  Other 
training 
studies 
environments,  such  as  classroom  teaching  of  science  and 
biology at different levels [15], [16]. Others have investigated

their  effectiveness  in  navigation  tasks,  for  example,  in 
firefighting, preflight training for astronauts, and remembering 
shop locations [17]–[19]. 

Further, because of the lack of one modality of sensory input, 
which could lead to greater difficulties in VR, we extrapolate a 
second hypothesis we will investigate: 

Lee et al. [20] investigated how to instruct better people on 
memorizing  paths  in  VR.  To  do  that,  they  compared  the 
difference between annotating the path and following a virtual 
character. They found that people performed better when they 
were instructed on what to do rather than to follow a character. 
This effect might have to do with some form of excessive mental 
demand similar to that found when advanced biology students 
were studying in the virtual lab [21]. It also might suggest that 
further developments on character are not needed for this kind 
of context training [9].  

Earlier studies of spatial memory acquisition compared 2D 
and 3D mazes. They used a computer screen against a CAVE-
like environment and observed that there was a greater level of 
certain brain activities when participants were learning the paths 
in 3D when compared to the participants learning it in 2D. This 
observation shows that the greater the realism, the better it might 
be for spatial learning [22]–[24].  

Suma et al. [25] compared a maze viewed in VR HMD and 
in  real  life  to  evaluate  different  kinds  of  locomotion.  They 
observed  that  people  felt  sicker  when  walking  in  the  VR 
environment  than  when  moving  using  a  controller.  However, 
people had better recall when walking. However, this study was 
done in 2009, before low-cost, higher-resolution HMDs became 
accessible, which could have changed this paradigm. As such, 
evaluations  with newer  HMDs  are  still needed to explore  this 
issue further. 

Recently,  Mossel  et  al.  [6]  investigated  the  differences 
between  using  a  controller  and  a  walking  platform  in  a 
firefighting scenario and a mobile VR device. The participants 
in this study did not favor one kind of locomotion over the other. 
However,  there  was  an  emphasis  on  the  importance  of 
navigation being a “very important” factor in these kinds of drill 
scenarios. 

Furthermore,  the  interaction  between  view  and  how  the 
virtual environment is controlled can be of significant effect on 
performance and immersion. In a recent study, Monteiro et al. 
[26]  observed  that  in  a  2D  view  environment,  participants 
performed better in their task when they were using a keyboard 
than the regular controller; on the other hand, in 3D view, the 
controller fared better than the keyboard.  

Finally, in a study that evaluated what aspects of locomotion 
were  more  likely  to  affect  the  learning  outcomes  in  a  maze, 
Chrastil and Warren [27] observed that visual and podokinetic 
(or foot movement) information significantly contribute to path 
memorization. It is likely that, in a scenario that involves real 
locomotion,  having  experienced  the  controller  without  the 
associated foot movement and other aspects of the controller not 
being  as  natural  might  lead  to  lower  path  memorization.  This 
observation led us to our  first hypothesis: 

H1 – Participants will perform better after training in the real 
world than when training in VR. 

H2 – Participants whose navigation is poor will be slower after 
training in VR than those after training in the real world. 

That  is,  we  believe  that  even  if  the  first  hypothesis  is  not 
supported  by  our  data,  a  subgroup  of  our  participants  will 
present the expected behavior. 

B.  Video Games and Learning 

In  general,  studies  have  shown  that video games can  alter 
cognition  and  perception.  A  typical  example  is,  for  example, 
people  who,  after  being  exposed  to  video  games,  consistently 
present  improvements  in  mental  rotation  [28],  [29].  Other 
examples  include  people  who  show  improvement  in  vision-
related  challenges,  like  better  performance  in  search  tasks, 
attention, and muscle memory, also show greater sensitivity to 
contrast [30]–[35]. To some extent, some of these aspects have 
also been shown in VR environments [36]–[38].   

More recent studies have suggested that video games might 
not enhance navigational skills in the real world. This is aligned 
with the findings from Chrastil and Warren [27], who observed 
that foot movement information significantly contributes to path 
memorization. That is, because video games do not involve foot 
movement, path memorization will not be affected. Nonetheless, 
in  the  same  work,  Chrastil  and  Warren  [27]  have  found  that 
visual  input  is  an  important  factor  in  path  recall.  As  such, 
because  of  the  enhanced  immersive  experience  in  VR,  we 
hypothesize that VR will have a mediating effect, which is our 
third hypothesis: 

H3 – Participants who play  video games regularly will score 
better than those who do not. 

III.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 

To test our hypotheses, we used a maze challenge with which 
to  run  our  experiment.  We  chose  a  maze  because  of  its 
flexibility,  allowing  us  to  decide  the  degree  of  difficulty  we 
would explore. Additionally, mazes are, to a large extent, one of 
the  most  basic  forms  of  navigation  scenarios,  working  as 
placeholders  for  buildings  and  streets,  for  example.  In  other 
words, it is the simplest form of pathfinding and navigation with 
which people are familiar. Thus, a maze grants us an advanced 
understanding  of  the  building  blocks  of  spatial  knowledge 
acquisition before exploring higher dimensions of learning. 

Our  maze  was  built  using  portable  and  modular  empty 
frames  that  connect  to  each  other  to  generate  more  complex 
structures. This gave us the ability to transport and remodel the 
maze  according  to  need.  The  walls  were  made  using  a  black 
ethylene-vinyl  acetate  (plastic)  fabric.  The  dark  and  non-
transparent  fabric  stopped  participants  from  spying  into  other 
parts of the path while not being heavy (as seen in Fig 1). The 
maze was designed in association with a collaborator from the 
architecture department to guarantee that it would fit in the room 
and  that  the  proportions  in  the  VR  environment  would  be 
adequate.  

ranging  between  18  and  30.  All  volunteers  had  normal  or 
normal-to-corrected  vision,  and  none  of  them  declared  any 
history  of  color  blindness  or  other  health  issues,  physical  or 
otherwise.  Nine  participants  (90%)  had  experience  with  VR 
systems  before  the  experiment.  The  other participant declared 
having both poor navigation skills and do not play any kind of 
video games that involve navigation in a virtual environment. 

Participants  were  assigned  randomly  to  each  condition, 
respecting  the  rule  that  each  condition  would  have  the  same 
number of participants, and male to female ratio. No participant 
received any kind of compensation, monetary or otherwise. All 
participants  were  made  aware  of  the  experimental  conditions 
and expectations and consented to the experiment.  

C.  Procedure 

Fig 3 shows the overview of the experiment. On arrival, each 
participant was assigned  the specific condition in which he or 
she  would  test  the  maze.  The  random  assignment  had  been 
chosen to mitigate any kind of bias. The participants then filled 
a  questionnaire  to  collect  demographic  and  past  gaming 
experience  information,  such  as  age,  how  often  they  played 
games,  whether  they  had  experience  with  VR,  and  their 
navigation skills.  

Fig 1. Picture of our maze material. The ease to assemble was vital to an indoor 
maze. 

As presented in  Fig 2,  we distributed the objects in a way 
that would require the participants to get into distinct depths of 
the maze for retrieving  them. We  expected the participants to 
have  at  least  three  decision  points  before  reaching  the 
destination  (i.e.,  each  item).  The  virtual  maze  was  developed 
using Unity3D, following the instruction given in the blueprint 
and assuring that the virtual walls’ size matched the size of the 
physical walls in a 1-to-1 fashion.

beginning and the end of the maze. The blue circles indicate the position of the 
items used in this experiment. 

A.  Apparatus 

We used an Oculus Rift CV1 as our HMD, as it is one of the 
most  popular  off-the-shelf  VR  devices.  The  HMD  was 
connected to a desktop with 16GB RAM, an Intel Core i7-7700k 
CPU @ 4.20GHz, a GeForce GTX 1080Ti dedicated GPU, and 
a  standard  21.5”  4K  monitor.  We  used  a  traditional  Oculus 
Touch,  which  is  one  factor  we  are  collecting  data  on  in  this 
experiment. 

B.  Participants 

Fig 3. A flowchart of the experimental design.  

Each participant stood individually next to the computer in 
which  the  virtual  maze  was  installed.  A  researcher  came  and 
explained how the VR equipment data collection worked so that 
the participants would be more comfortable wearing the device. 
After the  explanation,  the  researcher positioned  the  device on 
the  participants’  heads,  checked  the  comfort  level,  and 
repositioned the device if necessary. All participants then tested 
the device  with the  Oculus  Demo  scene for 2  minutes  so  that 
participants in the VR condition would know how to deal with 
the  Oculus  Touch,  while  the  participants  in  the  real-life  (RL) 
condition would have had the same exposure to ensure that the 
extra VR training would not be a confounding factor.  

We  recruited  a  total  of  10  participants  (4  females)  from  a 
local university. They had an average age of 21.10 (s.e. = 3.73), 

After  the  introduction,  we  asked  participants  to  wait  5 
minutes to give them a rest from the VR HMD. Subsequently, 

 
 
 
they would then start the training. This time the VR HMD was 
already  set  for  the  participant,  and  the  researcher  had  only  to 
check  that  the  devices  were  positioned  correctly.  Participants 
who did not use VR were just asked to start their walk in the 
maze.  Both  groups  were  timed  to  ensure  they  would  not 
overextend their time within the training. 

We  required  the  participants  to  take  10-minute  breaks 
between training and testing. Within these 10 minutes, they were 
asked to play a shooting game on a separate computer and solve 
a series of small math exercises so they would have their minds 
out of the maze. We wanted to ensure that they did not have a 
chance to keep looking at the maze, memorizing the path, giving 
them an unfair advantage. We made sure the waiting time was 
exactly 10 minutes for all participants.  

During  the  test,  one  researcher  would  tell  the  participant 
which object should be retrieved from the maze. After this, the 
researcher  started  the  stopwatch  for  that  specific  object.  The 
participant  should,  at  the  lowest  time,  bring  that  exact  object 
back to the researcher. The participants were not allowed to run 
and were not informed of the time of other participants so as not 
to foster competition which could skew the results. Even though 
researchers could not see into the maze, they could observe the 
first  directions  participants  took,  and  those  directions  were 
written  down.  Each  trial  in  the  maze  lasted  approximately  1 
minute and 20 seconds.  

Overall, the experiment lasted around 35 minutes for each 
participant.  Towards  the  end,  they  were  offered  refreshments 
such as beverages and snacks and were asked to stay in the lab 
for  a  few  minutes  to  make  sure  they  were  not  impaired  or 
uncomfortable  due  to  possible  simulator  sickness  or  general 
fatigue from exercising. Finally, they  were informed that they 
could leave the study lab at any moment if they so desired and 
feel comfortable doing so. 

IV.  RESULTS 

The  data  were  analyzed  using  both  statistical  inference 
methods and data visualizations. We conducted a Shapiro-Wilk 
test to check the normality of the data. As all were classified as 
normally  distributed,  they  received  a  parametric  analysis.  We 
conducted  Mauchly’s  Test  of  Sphericity  to  verify  if  the 
assumption of sphericity had been violated. We also employed 
Repeated Measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) using Bonferroni 
correction to detect significant main effects. If the assumption of 
sphericity  was  violated,  we  used  the  Greenhouse-Geisser 
correction to adjust the degrees of freedom.  

For  the  analysis,  we  compared  VR  and  real-life  (RL) 
navigation in the maze. However, given a clear divide between 
participants who declared themselves as experienced in games, 
we also checked to see if there was a clear difference between 
those who were experienced and those who were not. 

Fig 4 shows a summary of the main results. ANOVA tests 
suggested  that  there  were  no  significant  main  differences  in 
Total  Time  (F(1,  8)  =  .082, p =  .781) between  the  two 
conditions.  We  further  analyzed  each  time  individually  to 
observe possible individual differences due to the positioning of 
the items. However, none of  the  times  showed any difference 
either (for all p>0.05).  

Fig 4. Mean times by condition and demographics. 

The analysis taking into consideration the experience level 
people  have  from  playing  3D  games  also  did  not  present  any 
significant differences in Total Time (F(1, 8) = .140, p = .718). 
To be thorough, we investigated each individual’s times as well. 
The  individual  times  did  not  present  significant  differences 
either (for all p>0.05). When checking if  the declared level of 
navigation  ability  had  an  influence  on  time,  no  significant 
difference was found in Total Time (F(1, 8) = .140, p = .718). 
We were unable to discard the null hypothesis in  H1, H2, and 
H3. 

When going for the third item, most (4 out of 5) of the VR 
participants chose going right at first and then turning, whereas 
most (4 out of 5) of the participants who walked in the RL maze 
first went straight and then turned right (see Fig 5).  

Fig 5. The yellow line represents the beginning of the route to retrieve Item 3 
taken by the participants after training in the real-life condition. The blue line 
shows the path taken by the participants after training in VR. 

 
 
V.  DISCUSSION 

We  believe  these  results  to  be  very  positive  to  those  who 
want to use VR as a training tool since, regardless of expertise 
level with video games, the times of spatial recall using the VR 
were the same as the time of recall of those who used RL. This 
is a step up from what has been  presented  in previous studies 
that used older VR technology [25]. This older study did present 
positive results, but VR was still not on par with RL.  

It is possible that the smaller number of items in our study 
allowed our participants to remember the path better. However, 
this demonstrates that if people are fed in small pieces, training 
in both VR and RL yields virtually the same results. 

longer  route,  whereas 

It  is  interesting  to  observe  that  the  participants  chose 
different paths so consistently when going for an item located 
deeper into the maze. First, this might explain the slightly longer 
time  participants  took  during  this  item’s  retrieval  process. 
Second, it might indicate that visual memory and podokinectic 
memory  regard  distance  differently, emphasizing the need for 
studies evaluating gaze tracking in VR [39], [40]. It is possible 
that the participants took straighter paths inside the maze using 
the  predicted 
the  virtual  reality 
participants  did not have  this  “feeling” of  distance.  Naturally, 
we  are  intrigued  why  VR  participants  overwhelmingly  chose 
one  path,  whereas  the  RL  participants  chose  the  other.  To 
understand this pattern further will require more research to gain 
additional  insights  into  the  difference  between  the  two  path 
choices. While unlikely, it can be caused by other small clues, 
such  as  imperfections  on  the  walls,  the  researcher’s  body 
language.  However,  it is  important to  note  that  the researcher 
responsible  for  the  maze  did  not  know  the  participant's 
condition,  and  the  material  on  the  wall  was  new.  This  might 
indicate  that  distinct  parts  of  the  brain  are  involved  in  each 
process, which could mean that VR could eventually surpass RL 
training  for  spatial  knowledge  acquisition.  Further  research  is 
required  to  confirm  this  hypothesis,  given  that  such  in-depth 
investigations are beyond the scope of this paper. 

One limitation of this research is the size of our sample, as 
our experiment was affected by Covid-19. However, our number 
of participants is aligned with research presented in most papers 
published at one of the most rigorously reviewed conferences, 
CHI  [41].  As  such,  it  does  not  invalidate  our  scientific 
contribution and our findings. What we learned could be used to 
inform  future  research,  which  is  that  spatial  knowledge 
acquisition is less likely to be the cause of confounding factors. 
That is, when testing navigability, path training, and other spatial 
cognition, we can infer that if no other variables are being tested, 
the results will be like that of the real world or quite similar to 
it. 

VI.  CONCLUSION 

In this paper, we explored if spatial memory acquisition was 
comparable between real life (RL) and virtual reality (VR). To 
do so, we developed a maze experiment in which participants 
had to get into a maze and retrieve objects from it in an orderly 
way. Participants performed roughly the same in VR as they did 
in  an  RL  maze  of  the  same  features  regardless  of  their 
navigational ability and video game playing habits.  

Our  results  show  that  current  VR  technology  can  be 
confidently used for various applications that involve learning 
paths and memorizing locations, at least for tasks in short paths. 
It  allows  future  research  to  discard  negative  results  in  spatial 
memory  acquisition  as  a  VR  HMD  cofound  factor.  It  is 
important that research like this is continually explored using the 
latest VR technologies, as they change rapidly and in significant 
ways,  and  is  published  so  all  posterior  research  could  have 
empirical support to explore more complex investigations and 
scenarios.  

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  work  that 
investigates  the  differences  between  RL  and  VR  in  spatial 
knowledge  acquisition  using  modern  consumer-grade  VR 
HMD. Future steps involve analyzing other maze components 
like  the  point  of  view,  bird  eyes  and  if  the  use  of  kinematic 
controllers can improve the results further.
