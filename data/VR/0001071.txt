ABSTRACT

We report the discovery of a low surface brightness (LSB) object serendipitously found during deep
CCD imaging of a compact group of galaxies, Seyfert’s Sextet, in VR and I bands. The LSB object is
located 2.′3 southwest from the group center. Its surface brightness within the angular eﬀective radii
of re(VR) = 4.′′8 and re(I) = 4.′′8 is very low – µe(VR) = 25.28 mag arcsec−2 and µe(I) = 24.47 mag
arcsec−2, respectively. The apparent magnitudes are mAB(VR) = 19.87 mag and m(I) = 19.06 mag.
The object is most likely a LSB dwarf galaxy, but other possibilities are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies have been exten-
sively discussed within the context of the overall formation
and evolution of galaxies as well as observational cosmol-
ogy, and in particular for their possible contribution as a
major fraction of the total galaxy population (see Impey
& Bothun 1997, for a review). During deep imaging obser-
vations of the compact group of galaxies known as Seyert’s
Sextet (Nishiura et al. 1999) we found a LSB galaxy can-

on the photometric properties of this LSB candidate. We
adopt a Hubble constant of 100 h km s−1 Mpc−1 through-
out this paper.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

The observations were carried out at the University of
Hawaii 2.2 m telescope using the 8192×8192 (8k) CCD
Mosaic camera (Luppino et al. 1996). The camera was
attached at the f/10 Cassegrain focus and provided a
∼ 18′ × 18′ ﬁeld of view. The CCDs were read out in
the 2 × 2 pixel binning mode which gave an image scale
of 0.′′26 pixel−1. We obtained broad band images with the
VR and I ﬁlters on 1999 May 20 and May 23 (UT), respec-
tively. The integration time for each exposure was set to
8 minutes. Twenty-three exposures for the VR-band and
24 exposures for the I-band were taken, thus the total in-
tegration time amounted to 184 minutes in VR and 192
minutes in I.

Data processing was done in a standard way using
IRAF2. After bias and dark counts were subtracted, each

frame was divided by the ﬂatﬁeld image, which was a me-
dian image of all of the object frames obtained during a
night. The object frames were median-combined with their
positions registered. Typical seeing, as estimated from the
processed images, was ∼ 0.′′8 in both bands. Standard stars
from Landolt (1992) were observed and used for calibra-
tion of absolute ﬂuxes. Since the VR ﬁlter is not a stan-
dard photometric band (see Jewitt, Luu, & Chen 1996), we
adopted an AB magnitude scale for this bandpass. The ab-
solute photometric errors were estimated to be ±0.05 mag
for the VR-band and ±0.03 mag for I-band. The limit-
VR = 28.7 mag arcsec−2 and
ing surface brightnesses are µlim
I = 28.1 mag arcsec−2, corresponding to a 1σ variation
µlim
in the background.

3. RESULTS

In Figure 1 we show the VR- and I-band images of
Seyfert’s Sextet. A faint, extended object is located
in both bands at 2.′3 southwest from the group center
of Seyfert’s Sextet. Our estimate of the centroid po-
sition of this faint object is α(B1950)=15h 56m 51.s6,
δ(B1950)=+20◦ 52′ 42′′. As shown in the lower panels
of Figure 1, the shape of the object appears to be nearly
spherical in both bands and very diﬀuse compared with
the foreground/background galaxies around it. There is
no evidence that the object moved during the VR and I
observations (the VR image was taken three days prior
to the I band image), thus the object is not likely to be
within our solar-system.

Using a wavelet package in ESO-MIDAS,3 we applied

a Wiener-like wavelet ﬁlter to the images in order to im-
prove the signal-to-noise. The results are shown in Figure
2. In the central region of the processed VR image there
seem to be two intensity peaks lying along a northwest-
southeast direction with a separation of ∼ 2.′′5. On the
other hand, the I-band image shows a single peak which
is located between the two VR peaks. This could be in-
terpreted as being due to an inhomogeneous distribution
of dust, or perhaps a strong emission line from ionized gas
that appears in either band. Alternatively, the intensity
peaks near the center may be background galaxies. At 19′′
west of the center of the faint object there is another dif-
fuse condensation which could perhaps be interpreted as
a tidal structure. This companion structure appears to be
present in the original images, but given that the strength
of this feature is comparable to the noise uncertainty in
the original images, we will not discuss it further in this
paper.

Next we discuss the photometric properties of this LSB
object. Since the object appears to be nearly spherical,
we will adopt a circular aperture for computing the radial
light distribution. Apparent foreground/background ob-
jects were ﬁrst masked, and the surface brightness on the
original images was then determined using 0.′′8 radial bins
where the binwidth was set to be approximately equal to
the seeing. The center of the aperture was ﬁxed at the
position of the intensity peak in the noise reduced I-band
image. Figure 3 shows the surface brightness proﬁles in
both bands. These proﬁles cannot be simply ﬁt with an
exponential disk as can be seen by the fact that an expo-
nential proﬁle would appear as a straight line on the µ-r
plot (the upper panel of Figure 3). Although the observed
radial proﬁles could be approximated by a straight line ﬁt
∼< r ∼< 10′′, it is clear that the proﬁles ﬂatten
at radii 4′′
at r ∼< 4′′. Furthermore, a r1/4-law proﬁle, which is more
centrally concentrated than an exponential proﬁle, is also
a poor approximation to the observed data points. We
also note that since the ﬂattened region of the proﬁles is
large compared to the seeing size of ∼ 0.′′8, the ﬂat proﬁles
at r ∼< 4′′ are a genuine property of this LSB object.

In order to more accurately approximate the observed
radial surface brightness distribution, we decided to adopt
a r1/n-law ﬁt with n < 1;

µ(r) = µ0 + 2.5(log10 e) (cid:16)

1/n

,

r
s (cid:17)

where µ(r) is the surface brightness at a radius of r from
the center, µ0 is the central surface brightness, and s is
the angular scale length. This proﬁle is less concentrated
than an exponential proﬁle, i.e., shallower at the inner area
and a steeper proﬁle at the outer area than an exponential
proﬁle. The solid curves shown in Figure 3 are the best ﬁt
for each band. We used only the points at 1′′ < r < 10′′
(shown by the ﬁlled circles in Figure 3) to avoid the seeing
eﬀect at the center and the sky-noise limited area at large
radii. Table 1 lists the ﬁt parameters (n, µ0, and s) as well
as other photometric properties which were subsequently
derived. Our analysis shows that the LSB galaxy has a
r1/n surface brightness proﬁle with n ∼ 0.6.

4. DISCUSSION

ern Observatory.

We ﬁrst discuss the observed properties of our candi-
date LSB galaxy in terms of the known properties of LSB
galaxies. The color of our LSB candidate is VR − I ≃ 0.81.
Since the VR-band is inconvenient for comparison with
standard photometry of galaxies, we ﬁrst estimated that
V − I ≃ 0.94 and R − I ≃ 0.49 by interpolating the ob-
served ﬂuxes in the VR-band and I-band. These colors are
not peculiar for LSB dwarfs or LSB disk galaxies (e.g., Im-
pey & Bothun 1997). One of the characteristics of our LSB
object is the r1/n surface brightness proﬁle with n ∼ 0.6,
however the majority of LSB galaxies exhibit an exponen-
tial proﬁle, i.e., n = 1 (O’Neil, Bothun, & Cornell 1997).
On the other hand, many of the faiter dwarf ellipticals in
the Fornax cluster have less concentrated proﬁles than the
exponential (Caldwell & Bothun 1987). Davies et al. 1988
also showed that a signiﬁcant number of LSB dwarf galax-
ies in the Fornax cluster show r1/n-law proﬁles with n < 1.
Furthermore, O’Neil et al. (1997) showed that 17 % of the
LSB galaxies in their sample have less concentrated sur-
face brightness proﬁles than an exponential disk although
they did not ﬁt the proﬁles with the r1/n law but instead
used a King model proﬁle.

Caon, Capaccioli, & D’Onofrio (1993) found that the
value of n is well correlated with the eﬀective radius (Re)
for spheroidal galaxies ranging from the LSB dwarfs in the
sample of Davies et al. (1988) to the giant ellipticals in the
Virgo cluster. In this context, the observed exponent of
n ∼ 0.6 for our LSB candidate implies that this object
is indeed a good candidate for a LSB dwarf galaxy. As
shown in Figure 5 of Caon et al. (1993), the LSB dwarfs
with n < 1 have Re in a range between ≃ 0.13 kpc and
≃ 1.3 kpc. Given the angular eﬀective radius of our LSB
galaxy candidate of re = 4.′′8, this would imply a distance
somewhere in the range of 5.4 Mpc to 54 Mpc, and a corre-
sponding absolute I-band magnitude of between −10 mag
and −15 mag, which is comparable to those of dwarf galax-
ies in the Local Group (Mateo 1998). This would imply
that our LSB galaxy candidate would be at the faint end
of the luminosity function of LSB galaxies (e.g. Impey &
Bothun 1997).

If the LSB galaxy is located at the same distance as
Seyfert’s Sextet (44 h−1 Mpc), one might conclude that
the LSB galaxy may have been formed through possible
tidal interactions between the group galaxies. The pro-
jected separation of the LSB galaxy from the group center
is ≈ 30 h−1 kpc. The LSB galaxy could travel this distance
in 2 × 108 years assuming a a projected velocity equal to
the radial velocity dispersion (138 km s−1) of the group.
At smaller distances than that of Seyfert’s Sextet, only
one galaxy is known within 1◦ of the LSB candidate. It
is also a LSB galaxy, F583-1 (= D584-04: Schombert &
Bothun 1988; Schombert et al. 1992; Schombert, Pildis, &
Eder 1997). The distance toward F583-1 corresponding to
its redshift is 25 h−1 Mpc. If our LSB galaxy is located
at the same distance as F583-1, the apparent separation
of 23′ between F583-1 and the LSB galaxy corresponds to
170 h−1 kpc.

Another possibility is that the LSB object is located at a
much smaller distance. This would imply that the LSB ob-
ject may be a system more like Galactic globular clusters.
In fact, a King model proﬁle with a concentration param-

eter of ∼ 0.7 and a core radius of ∼ 4.′′0 is also a food ﬁt
to the present LSB object (Note: we have not shown this
ﬁt since it is very similar to that shown in Fig. 3). O’Neil
et al. (1997) noted a possibility that some LSB objects
well ﬁtted with the King proﬁle that were found in their
survey may be Galactic LSB globular clusters. Although
the concentration parameter of c ∼ 0.7 of our LSB object
is smaller than those of typical Galactic globular clusters
(e.g., Chernoﬀ & Djorgovski 1989), globular clusters in the
outer halo of the Galaxy (∼ 30–100 kpc from the Galac-
tic center) have concentration parameters as small as our
LSB object (see, for example, Djorgovski & Meylan 1994).
The central surface brightness of the globular clusters in
the Galactic halo can be as faint as ∼ 24 mag arcsec−2
in V , which is comparable to those of LSB galaxies. The
clusters in the Galactic halo have larger core radii of ∼ 20
pc than globular clusters at smaller galactocentric radii
because of smaller tidal forces at larger distance from the
galactic center. If the present LSB object is such a distant
globular cluster, it should have a core radius of ∼ 20 pc.
Thus, the apparent core radius of rc ∼ 4.′′0 leads to a dis-
tance toward the LSB object of ∼ 1 Mpc. However if this
is the case, stars in the LSB would be resolved spatially in
our images. Therefore, this possibility can be rejected.

In summary, we have discovered a LSB object near the
compact group of galaxies known as Seyfert’s Sextet. The

LSB object is likely to be one of the following: 1) a ﬁeld
LSB dwarf galaxy at a distance of 5.4–54 Mpc, or 2) a
LSB dwarf galaxy at the same distance of Seyfert’s Sex-
tet (44 h−1 Mpc). Measurement of the redshift, either by
optical spectroscopy or by radio observations of H I gas
will be necessary to determine which of these descriptions
applies.
