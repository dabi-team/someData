ABSTRACT

The Disk Detective citizen science project recently released a new catalog of disk candidates found
by visual inspection of images from NASA’s Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission and
other surveys. We applied this new catalog of well-vetted disk candidates to search for new members
of nearby young stellar associations (YSAs) using a novel technique based on Gaia data and virtual
reality (VR). We examined AB Doradus, Argus, β Pictoris, Carina, Columba, Octans-Near, Tucana-
Horologium, and TW Hya by displaying them in VR together with other nearby stars, color-coded to
show infrared excesses found via Disk Detective. Using this method allows us to ﬁnd new association
members in mass regimes where isochrones are degenerate. We propose ten new YSA members with
infrared excesses: three of AB Doradus (HD 44775, HD 40540 and HD 44510), one of β Pictoris
(HD 198472), two of Octans-Near (HD 157165 and BD+35 2953), and four disk-hosting members of
a combined population of Carina, Columba and Tucana-Horologium: CPD-57 937, HD 274311, HD
41992, and WISEA J092521.90-673224.8. This last object (J0925) appears to be an extreme debris
disk with a fractional infrared luminosity of 3.7 × 10−2. We also propose two new members of AB
Doradus that do not show infrared excesses: TYC 6518-1857-1 and CPD-25 1292. We ﬁnd HD 15115
appears to be a member of Tucana-Horologium rather than β Pictoris. We advocate for membership in
Columba-Carina of HD 30447, CPD-35 525, and HD 35841. Finally, we propose that three M dwarfs,
previously considered members of Tuc-Hor are better considered a separate association, tentatively
called “Smethells 165”.

1. INTRODUCTION

Stars in young moving groups and associations often show excess emission at infrared (IR) wavelengths pointing
to the presence of circumstellar disks (e.g. Zuckerman et al. 2011; Mo´or et al. 2016; Boucher et al. 2016): gas-rich
protoplanetary and transitional disks, and gas-poor debris disks. Since membership in these young moving groups and
associations yields stellar age estimates, these disks in young moving groups have become central to our understanding
of planet formation. They provide us with a timeline for disk evolution between ∼ 3 and 200 Myr, chronicling the

transition from primordial and debris stages, and providing critical time constraints for gas and planetesimal accretion
and orbit evolution (e.g. Mamajek 2009; Meng et al. 2017). Furthermore, many disks with resolved images, like β
Pictoris, HR 4796A, AU Microscopii, belong to young moving groups; knowing the ages of these disks allows us to
examine and model their dynamics in detail (e.g. Nesvold & Kuchner 2015a,b; Grady et al. 2020; Mo´or et al. 2020).

Thanks to recent releases of data from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Gaia telescope, Data Release 2 (DR2)
and Early Data Release 3 (EDR3), there has been a ﬂurry of activity to identify new young stellar association (YSA)
candidates. Some of these studies used infrared excess as a clue to group membership, and others used Gaia-informed
group membership as a way to ﬁnd new disks. For example, Esplin et al. (2018) announced 179 new disks in the Upper
Scorpius Association based on Gaia data and photometry from NASA’s Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
mission. Luhman & Esplin (2020) reﬁned this work using DR2 astrometry. Melton (2020) identiﬁed 27 candidate
members of the Lupus star forming region by combining DR2 data with disk determinations based on photometry
from NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope. Zuckerman et al. (2019) described the large percentage of M-type stars with
warm excess infrared emission in the χ1 Fornacis cluster. Zuckerman (2019) argued for the validity of the nearby
Argus association based in part on a membership list containing 80% infrared-excess stars.

Nonetheless, much more remains to be learned about disks in moving groups using Gaia data, especially in concert
with infrared photometry from WISE. The presence of a disk can be an especially vital youth indicator for A and F
type stars, a mass range where isochrones can be degenerate, and Lithium depletion methods for age assessment fail.
The Disk Detective citizen science project (Kuchner et al. 2016), launched in 2014, asked members of the public to
examine images of WISE sources to search for reliable disk candidates: stars with infrared excess at 22µm. This eﬀort
has generated a catalog of roughly 30,000 strong disk candidates, many of which are known to be YSA members. A
representative subset of these sources has been checked for background objects via higher resolution imaging (Silverberg
et al. 2018). Since possession of a disk is often a sign of youth (but see also the discussion of Be stars in Kuchner et al.
2016), this new catalog of reliable disk candidates has great potential as a source of new YSA members.

Indeed, we have begun combing the Disk Detective catalog to identify new members of nearby YSAs (including
young moving groups), using BANYAN Σ (Gagn´e et al. 2018c) (Silverberg et al., in prep.). Since Gaia DR2 became
available in April 2018, several codes and techniques for identifying new moving group candidates have seen wide use.
The multivariate Gaussian model (Gagn´e et al. 2018c) known as BANYAN Σ uses a Bayesian algorithm to identify
new YSA members. This tool calculates membership probabilities of stars for 27 YSAs within 150 pc of the sun using
multivariate Gaussian distributions in six dimensions, that is, X, Y, Z, U, V, W space. The LocAting Constituent
mEmbers In Nearby Groups (LACEwING) algorithm (Riedel et al. 2017b) uses a frequentist approach combined with
triaxial ellipsoid models and optionally an epicyclic traceback code. Additionally, Lee & Song (2019a) developed a
new 4-stage iterative method for evaluating the membership in nearby YSAs. The Lee & Song (2019a) paper contains
3D ellipsoidal models in XYZ and in UVW for 9 moving groups that are younger than 200 Myr and within 100 pc of
the sun.

These tools have greatly streamlined the process of ﬁnding new candidate members of YSAs for most situations.
However, all of the tools described above, including BANYAN Σ, are limited by the quality of their YSA models–e.g.,
the parameters of their tri-axial ellipsoids. The quality of these models is in turn determined by the number and
ﬁdelity of the lists of assumed bona-ﬁde members of each YSA. Since our process had the potential to add multiple
new members to each moving group, and since Gaia represents such a dramatic shift in the quantity and quality of
astrometric data for nearby stars, we sought an alternative, ab initio process for identifying new YSA members that
would not rely on such pre-Gaia membership lists.

This paper describes our novel VR-based approach and the new candidate YSA members we have identiﬁed. We
describe the Disk Detective citizen science project, and the new database of disk candidates available in the Mikulski
Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) in Section 2. We discuss the VR methodology in Section 3. We discuss the newly
identiﬁed YSA members with disks in Sections 4, 5 and 6, with further discussion about WISEA J092521.90-673224.8
in Section 7.

2. THE DISK DETECTIVE CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT

The Disk Detective citizen science project, ﬁrst launched in January 2014, asks members of the public to examine
images of sources from the AllWISE catalog to search for reliable disk candidates. Most objects that appear to have
infrared excesses based on simple WISE color cuts are in fact false positives created by confusion or contamination
(Kennedy & Wyatt 2012; Silverberg et al. 2018; Dennihy et al. 2020). Disk Detective solves this problem through

citizen science; volunteers at Disk Detective have worked to weed out most of the false positives by examining images
of source from the AllWISE catalog, the 2MASS project, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the DSS (Silverberg et al.
2018).

The Disk Detective project has resulted in several noteworthy discoveries, including a new category of disks, the
“Peter Pan Disks” (Silverberg et al. 2016, 2020; Lee et al. 2020; Coleman & Haworth 2020). Peter Pan disks are so
called because the stellar ages, based on moving group membership, indicate that these gas-rich disks have lasted far
longer than the typical lifetimes assumed for such disks. Disk Detective citizen scientists discovered the ﬁrst example
of this phenomenon (Silverberg et al. 2016; Murphy et al. 2018) and several later examples (Silverberg et al. 2020).
The Disk Detective project discovered the closest brown dwarf disk younger than 10 Myr (Schutte et al. 2020) and
twelve likely warm dust disks around candidate members of co-moving pairs based on Gaia astrometry (Silverberg
et al. 2018), which supports the hypothesis that warm dust is associated with binary systems (Zuckerman 2015). Disk
Detective citizen scientists also helped locate the oldest known disk around a white dwarf (Debes et al. 2019) and
the ﬁrst debris disk discovered around a star with a white dwarf companion (Kuchner et al. 2016). Fifteen citizen
scientists have become named co-authors on refereed publications as a result of their participation in Disk Detective
(not including this paper).

To extend Disk Detective information to those objects that were not fully classiﬁed before the project went oﬄine
on April 30, 2019, we used the objects that had been fully classiﬁed to train a GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al. 2014) neural
network. The full details of this process will be presented in Silverberg et al. (in prep). Brieﬂy, we composited the
nine images used on the Disk Detective site for each subject into one image, along with the classiﬁcation information
for that subject, and used this to train the neural network. We tested three methods to determine whether a given
subject was a good disk candidate:
if “None of the above” was a simple majority of classiﬁcations (majGood), a
plurality of classiﬁcations (pluralGood), or made up at least 20% of classiﬁcations (twentyGood). The neural network
then assigned each new (unclassiﬁed) subject a score of 0 to 100 based on each of the above neural networks. We
then asked four expert citizen scientists to blindly evaluate 476 subjects with a “good” score > 90 out of 100 by the
“majority”-trained neural network. Of these 476 subjects that were identiﬁed as likely good disk candidates by the
neural network, the citizen scientists found 118 to be false positives; i.e. 25% of the subjects classiﬁed as good by
the neural network would not have been classiﬁed as “None of the Above/Good disk candidate” by citizen scientists.
While this false positive rate is non-negligible, it is low enough to be useful for some purposes—e.g. searching for
candidate members of YSAs. We added the subjects classiﬁed by the neural net (those with the majGood parameter
> 90) to the list of Disk Detective disk candidates we used in this paper. A catalog of Disk Detective data is available
to the public in the MAST archive1. This catalog contains all of the disk candidates we used, including those selected
by the neural network.

3. EXAMINING YOUNG STELLAR ASSOCIATIONS USING VIRTUAL REALITY

We have been examining Gaia DR2 data on positions and velocities of stars using the PointCloudsVR appli-
cation combined with the HTC Vive system. PointCloudsVR, available on GitHub at https://github.com/nasa/
PointCloudsVR, leverages the advantages of virtual reality to intuitively immerse viewers in the 3D data and easily
see spatial relationships. It uses two controllers to move around in and zoom/pan in and out of an interactive 360◦
scene. We used a custom application layer developed by the Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) Research
& Development Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Spaceﬂight Center (GSFC) to load and visualize the Gaia data, and
animate the stars according to the space velocities measured by Gaia. This (AR/VR) Research & Development Lab-
oratory has developed VR software for a variety of space science and engineering applications, including heliophysics
and planetary science applications. VR in general has seen a variety of applications in astrophysics during the last few
years, including displaying Lyα maps (Lee et al. 2018), mapping the morphology of a molecular cloud (Romano et al.
2019) and cataloging galaxy groups (Lambert et al. 2020).

Of the 1.7 billion stars in DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018), approximately 4 million stars have both Gaia-
measured radial velocities and Gaia-measured parallaxes greater than 0.6. We loaded this sample into the Point-
CloudsVR app. We also loaded lists of the Gaia IDs of members of 40 YSAs from the literature (see below).

We then loaded the Gaia IDs of our catalog of 48,965 disk candidates from Disk Detective, including 13,626 that
were determined by the neural network, as described above. We used these lists to highlight and color code the

Higashio et al.

representations of the Gaia DR2 stars in our VR simulations. For example, in one run all the stars with disk candidates
from Disk Detective were color-coded orange, and all the known members of the Tuc-Hor association green, and turned
oﬀ all the rest of the Gaia DR2 catalog. Figure 1 shows a representative screenshot of the PointCloudsVR simulation—
collapsed to two dimensions of course. We used this color coding to highlight various lists of stars to search for new
YSA members, one YSA at a time, using the following iterative process.

First, we highlighted the members of the YSA, observed them from various angles and distances to get a sense of its
distribution in XYZ space, and evolved the stellar positions backwards and forwards in time to develop an intuition
for the group’s velocity distribution. Then we highlighted our disk candidates alongside the known YSA members and
compared them to look for possible new kinematic YSA members. Once we had recorded a preliminary list of the
disk candidates associated with the YSA, we created a new catalog combining the new candidate members with the
previously published members. We then highlighted only that new combined catalog, examined it, and removed any
obvious interlopers. Then we repeated this process, highlighting the whole Disk Detective catalog again, comparing
it with the new combined catalog to ﬁnd new candidate members, again combining any new candidates and checking
for interlopers. We repeated this inspection process for each YSA in our database until it stopped turning up new
candidates.

Figure 1. Screen shot of our PointCloudsVR simulation. This view would ordinarily be experienced through a virtual reality
headset. Points represent the positions of stars in YSAs plotted in Galactic (X, Y, Z) coordinates. The app allows us to
advance the positions of all the points forward (and move them backward) in time using Gaia DR2 velocities together with
newly identiﬁed disk hosting stars. Clearly visible are the Coma Ber (pink, top), Hyades (orange, lower left) Upper Scorpius
(green, top right) associations, Octans (yellow). The X-axis points to the right, the Y-axis points to the left and the Z-axis
points up. The big tick marks on the X, Y, Z axes are 100 pc apart; the small ticks are 10 pc apart.

Although numerical clustering algorithms can also be used to search for and scope out the size of these six-dimensional
clumps, our VR approach has multiple advantages over clustering techniques. First, YSAs vary greatly in their degrees
of clustering, and some of them have multiple components, such as a tight core combined with a more diﬀuse halo.
The human eye has no diﬃculty recognizing these structures, which could easily fool a clustering algorithm unless it
were repeatedly re-tuned. Second, Gaia detection limits impose a luminosity-dependent edge to any large structure

on the side away from the Sun. A clustering algorithm would need to be taught about this eﬀect, while a human eye
recognizes it instinctively.

We worked our way through 8 diﬀerent YSAs using VR, comparing the Disk Detective catalog bit by bit against
the lists of known YSA members. Table 1 lists all of the proposed new candidate YSA members we found. Figures 2
through 14 show position/velocity and colour magnitude diagrams for each of the YSAs where we identiﬁed likely new
members. The assumed members are plotted in blue, and the sources of each membership list appear in the ﬁgure
captions. The proposed new members are plotted in red.

4. NEW CANDIDATE YSA MEMBERS AND YSA MEMBERS WITH DISKS

Here we discuss each of the YSAs we examined except for Carina, Columba and Tucana Horologium. We will

examine those three together in a subsequent section. We also brieﬂy discuss each star of interest.

4.1. AB Doradus Moving Group

The closest known moving group, AB Doradus (AB Dor) (Zuckerman et al. 2004), contains a core or nucleus of ∼ 10
stars at a distance of 20 pc, along with dozens of purported “stream” members distributed across the sky. Figure 2
shows a list of known members of AB Doradus from Lee & Song (2019a). Several groups have recently proposed
membership lists for this group, including Gagn´e et al. (2018c,b); Gagn´e & Faherty (2018) and Schneider et al. (2019).
The new, more comprehensive, list by Lee & Song (2019a) utilizes Gaia DR2 and machine learning.

In this ﬁgure, the origin of each arrow is the star’s current Galactic position from Gaia DR2. The arrows show how
far each star moves in 1000 years based on its Gaia DR 2 velocity. Based on the ﬁndings by (Gagn´e et al. 2018a) the
age of AB Doradus has been reﬁned at 133+15
−20 Myr. It has also been suggested that the “stream” members do not
all share a common age with the core members (Barenfeld et al. 2013). Note, however, that the Lee & Song (2019a)
membership list does not appear to show this core + stream structure.

Our VR inspection revealed three new candidate disk-hosting members of this group to add to the list of possible
AB Doradus members. Note that all of these stars have Gaia radial velocities (as do all the infrared-excess stars in
this paper). All three of these stars lie on one side of the association, in the -X, -Y direction (see the left panel of
Figure 2). They were assigned low (< 7%) probabilities of membership in AB Doradus by BANYAN Σ, probably
because of the dearth of known members at that XYZ position in the BANYAN Σ membership list. But these new
candidates have velocities resembling the average velocity of the known members (see Figure 2) and the presence of
infrared excesses is a sign of youth.

HD 44775 (WISEA J062218.66-295134.7) is a proposed new AB Dor member, and an F3V at 105 pc. After we
identiﬁed this proposed member in VR, we read that Oh et al. (2017) found this star to be part of a co-moving triple
together with TYC 6518-1857-1 (98 pc) and CPD-25 1292 (96 pc). These two co-movers are shown as green arrows
labelled T and C, respectively, in Figure 2.

HD 40540 (WISEA J055752.60-342834.1) is a proposed new AB Dor member, and an A8IV at 88 pc, has a
debris disk that was ﬁrst recognized in IRAS data by Rhee et al. (2007). Later Spitzer spectroscopy revealed that the
dust has a negligible crystallinity fraction (< 4% Mittal et al. 2015).

HD 44510 (WISEA J061903.93-535823.9) is a proposed new AB Dor member, and an F3V at 108 pc. Cruz-Saenz
de Miera et al. (2014) previously identiﬁed this star as having an infrared excess.

Figure 2. Previously-identiﬁed members of AB Doradus from Lee & Song (2019a) (blue), proposed new disk-hosting members
of AB Doradus from Disk Detective (red) and comoving stars (green), in XYZ (parsecs from the sun) with vectors showing
UVW (parsecs/1000 years). Of these candidates, J0622 is found in Table 5 of David & Hillenbrand (2015) as well as in comoving
catalogs Bochanski et al. (2018) and Oh et al. (2017) in a group of 3 comoving stars (labelled in green as C and T). All three
candidates were previously identiﬁed as infrared excess stars, but not as AB Dor members.

Figure 3 shows a colour magnitude diagram (CMD) for AB Doradus, including the Gaia EDR3 ﬁeld main sequence,
shown in grey. The solid lines show isochrones at 10, 20, 30,...,100 Myr from Marigo et al. (2017) available online2.
The blue points show the previously-identiﬁed members of AB Doradus from Lee & Song (2019a). The red and green

Figure 3. Colour magnitude diagram (CMD) of AB Doradus (blue) with proposed new members with disks (red) and comovers
(green) with isochrones from 10 Myr (top) to 100 Myr (bottom) and Gaia EDR3 ﬁeld stars. The proposed new members lie in a
sequence with the other AB Dor members. Note how the isochrones tend to be degenerate toward the blue end of this diagram,
where our proposed new disk-hosting members lie.

The members from Lee & Song (2019a) are barely distinguishable from the EDR3 ﬁeld, consistent with the (Bell
et al. 2015) age estimate of 149+51
−19 Myr, except perhaps at the reddest end of the CMD. Toward the blue end, where
the new proposed members are, the isochrones are degenerate, making it even harder to constrain the ages of the
new proposed members. This CMD highlights an important trend; the new members we discover using VR are often
in a mass regime where isochrones are degenerate, making them hard to identify as group members in an isochronal
analysis.

4.2. Argus

The Argus association (Torres et al. 2008) contains many stars within 100 pc of Earth, including the well-known
debris disk hosts β Leonis and 49 Ceti. Zuckerman (2019) argued for the physicality of this association and provided
the most recent membership list and age estimate for this association: 40-50 Myr. We used this catalog of known Argus
members, which includes nine stars with known infrared excesses. Our process recovered four previously identiﬁed
members of Argus, including two disk-hosting stars previously identiﬁed by the Disk Detective project using the
BANYAN Σ tool (Silverberg et al.
in prep). However, our process did not recover any new candidate disk-hosting
members of Argus.

4.3. β Pictoris

The well-studied β Pictoris (β Pic) moving group (Zuckerman et al. 2001a) appears to be one of the closest YSAs
to the Sun. Miret-Roig et al. (2020) provide a useful overview of age estimates for this group. Miret-Roig et al.
(2020) themselves present a dynamical traceback age of 18.5+2.0
−2.4 Myr based on Gaia DR2. Recent estimates based on
isochrone ﬁtting (e.g. Mamajek & Bell 2014; Binks & Jeﬀries 2016) and estimates from lithium depletion boundary
ﬁtting (e.g. Binks & Jeﬀries 2014; Messina et al. 2016), perhaps the most reliable technique, hover around 24 Myr.

We ﬁrst examined membership lists for β Pictoris from Gagn´e et al. (2018c,b); Gagn´e & Faherty (2018) and Schneider
et al. (2019), but then decided to use the more comprehensive membership list from Lee & Song (2019a), derived using
machine learning and Gaia DR2.

We propose to assign HD 198472 to this group; this star was previously known to have an infrared excess (prior
to Disk Detective). Our examination also suggests a new group assignment for HD 15115, one of the disk-hosting
members listed in Lee & Song (2019a). Figure 4 depicts the group members from Lee & Song (2019a) in blue, and the
two stars of interest (red and teal).

HD 198472 (WISEA J205241.67-531624.8) is a proposed β Pictoris member, an F 5/6 V star at a distance of
63 pc. This star was ﬁrst robustly identiﬁed as having an infrared excess by Wu et al. (2013). David & Hillenbrand

Disk-Hosting Members of Young Stellar Associations

11

(2015) found an isochronal age for this star of > 1.5 Gyr. However, this star is kinematically identiﬁed with β Pictoris
in Crundall et al. (2019), but this paper did not mention the infrared excess or any other signs of youth. Thus, the
kinematics and the presence of an infrared excess suggest that an assignment of this star to β Pictoris should be
considered seriously.

HD 15115 (WISEA J022616.32+061732.8) was identiﬁed as a member of β Pictoris by Lee & Song (2019a) but it
has previously been associated with AB Dor, Tuc-Hor and Columba. The well-known edge-on debris disk around this
star has been resolved by HST NICMOS (Debes et al. 2008), LBT (Rodigas et al. 2012), Gemini NICI (Mazoyer et al.
2014) and VLT SPHERE (Engler et al. 2019b), and has also been spatially resolved by Subaru’s SCExAO/CHARIS
(Lawson et al. 2020). ALMA imaging shows evidence for two rings in the disk separated by a cleared gap (MacGregor
et al. 2019). The center and right panels of Figure 4 show that its velocity is a poor match for β Pictoris. We prefer
to identify this infrared excess star with Tuc-Hor; further discussion about this star can be found below and in Figure
10 under Section 5.1.

We also recovered BD+45 598 (WISEA J022113.11+460006) which Hinkley et al. (2021) recently classiﬁed as a
member of β Pictoris, and which Gagn´e et al. (2018c,b); Gagn´e & Faherty (2018); Schneider et al. (2019) and Lee &
Song (2019a) excluded from their membership lists. We found it to be a bit of an outlier based on its position, but a
good match to β Pictoris based on its velocity. Overall, the quality of the match looks acceptable, so we support the
conclusion of Mo´or et al. (2011) and Hinkley et al. (2021).

Figure 4. Previously identiﬁed members of β Pictoris (blue) from Lee & Song (2019a) and one new proposed disk-hosting
group member (J205241.67-532624.8, shown in red) in XYZ (parsecs from the sun) with vectors showing UVW (parsecs/1000
years). Our process also recovered BD+45 598 (J022113.11+460006) as a β Pic member (orange). The infrared excess star
HD 15115 (J022616.32+061732.8) (teal) was identiﬁed as a member of β Pic in the Lee & Song (2019a) catalog. However, its
velocity stands out from the velocities of the other stars here, as you can see (especially in the right panel). We prefer to identify
it with Tuc-Hor; further discussion about this star is found in Figure 10.

Figure 5 shows a colour magnitude diagram (CMD) for β Pictoris, including the Gaia EDR3 ﬁeld main sequence,
shown in grey. The solid lines show isochrones at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 Myr from Marigo et al. (2017) available online3.
The blue points show the previously-identiﬁed members of β Pictoris from Lee & Song (2019a). The red x shows our
proposed new member which has infrared excess while the teal dot shows HD 15115.

The members from Lee & Song (2019a) are found above the main sequence EDR3 ﬁeld, consistent with (Mamajek &
Bell 2014; Binks & Jeﬀries 2016, 2014; Messina et al. 2016) at around 24 Myr and our proposed new member appears
to be consistent with the previously-identiﬁed members of β Pictoris.

4.4. Octans-Near

Zuckerman et al. (2013) presented a list of 14 stars with UVW velocities resembling Octans, but located close to the
Sun, called “Octans-Near” (Oct Nr) (Figure 6). Mamajek (2016) asserted that this group “probably warrants stream
status,” meaning that evidence for the co-evolution of the Octans-Near stars was still thin. Indeed, the ages of the
stars in this group range from 30 to 100 Myr according to Zuckerman et al. (2013). Both of these studies predate
Gaia, however.

15115 (teal) with isochrones from 10 Myr (top) to 50 Myr (bottom) and Gaia EDR3 ﬁeld stars.

We applied our process to the Zuckerman et al. (2013) star list. We recovered one previously-known member listed by
Zuckerman et al. (2013): J034239.80-203243.3, which was discovered by Patel et al. (2014) to have an infrared excess.
Additionally we identify two other stars which may be related to Octans-Near, which reside somewhat farther from the
Sun than the rest of Octans-Near, in the opposite direction from Octans. These, nonetheless, resemble Octans-Near
in velocity and show signs of youth (infrared excess and x-ray emission). These stars are roughly 25 pc away from the
edge of Octans-Near (in the Y direction); for comparison, Octans-Near spans about 40 pc in this direction.

HD 157165 (WISEA J172007.53+354103.6) This F8 star at 99 pc was one of the ﬁrst 37 disk candidates
published by the Disk Detective project (Kuchner et al. 2016). Follow-up imaging by the project using Palomar/Robo-
AO searched for background objects in the Sloan-i ﬁlter within the 12 arcsecond radius of the WISE 4 Point Spread
Function and found none (Silverberg et al. 2018). Modeling of the spectral energy distribution of this system found
the disk temperature of 196 ± 30K and a fractional infrared excess of LIR/L(cid:63) ≈ 9.0 ± 1.5 × 10−5 This star has a wide
companion, BD+35 2953, 89.33 arcseconds away, inferred by (Andrews et al. 2017) from the Tycho-Gaia astrometric
solution. See below.

BD+35 2953, another F8 star 99 pc distant from the Sun, is a wide companion to HD 157165. It is also the optical
counterpart to a ROSAT All-Sky Survey X-ray source Guillout et al. (2009). This star does not have a measured
radial velocity in the Gaia DR2 catalog, therefore, the green arrow representing it in the ﬁgure shows only the proper
motion components of its motion.

Figure 7 shows a CMD for Octans-Near, including the Gaia EDR3 ﬁeld main sequence, shown in grey. The solid
lines show isochrones at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 Myr from Marigo et al. (2017) available online4. The blue points show the
previously-identiﬁed members of Octans-Near from Zuckerman et al. (2013). The red and green x’s show our proposed
new members: the red object has infrared excess, the green is a wide companion co-moving with it.

The members from Zuckerman et al. (2013) are barely distinguishable from the EDR3 ﬁeld, consistent with the age

estimate of 30 to 100 Myr, with our proposed new member and comover consistent with the age as well.

Our process did not yield any new members of the TW Hya Association (Kastner 2016). We searched for new
members of TW Hya, starting with a list of known members from Gagn´e et al. (2018c). There were no nearby Disk
Detective stars so our choice of this list of known members did not matter much.

Figure 6. Members of Octans-Near (blue) previously proposed by Zuckerman et al. (2013), in XYZ (parsecs from the sun)
with vectors showing UVW (parsecs/1000 years). We identiﬁed two other stars that could be related to this group: the infrared
excess star HD 157165 (J172007.53+354103.6), and a wide binary companion to this star (BD+35 2953) found by Andrews
et al. (2017). Note that BD+35 2953 (wide binary) has no measured radial velocity so the length and direction of the green
arrow is only based on two velocity components.

Figure 7. Colour magnitude diagram (CMD) of Octans-Near (blue) previously proposed by Zuckerman et al. (2013), with one
proposed new member with disk J1720 (red) and wide binary companion (BD+35 2953) to this star (green) found by Andrews
et al. (2017) with isochrones from 10 Myr (top) to 50 Myr (bottom) and Gaia EDR3 ﬁeld stars.

The Carina (Car), Columba (Col) and Tucana-Horologium (Tuc-Hor) groups overlap in position and velocity space.

The 32 Orionis (32 Or) group lurks nearby these as well, at a similar velocity. Let us discuss these together.

Bell et al. (2015) determined the ages for three of these YSAs homogeneously through isochrone ﬁtting: 45+11

−7 Myr
for the Carina association, 42+6
−4 Myr for the Columba association, and 45 ± 4 Myr for the Tucana-Horologium moving
group. In other words, the ages for these three groups are all consistent with one common age around 45 Myr. In
contrast, Bell et al. (2017) estimates the age of 32 Or using isochronal ﬁtting at 24 ± 4 Myr.

Recently, Lee & Song (2019a) proposed new membership lists for nine YSAs, including Carina, Columba and Tuc-
Hor. Then Lee & Song (2019b) reexamined the group assignments using two unsupervised machine learning algorithms
(K-means and Agglomerative Clustering), and argued for two new groups by re-combining the memberships of 32 Or
(ThOr), Columba, and Tuc-Hor. The discrepancies between these catalogs assembled by the same authors using
diﬀerent numerical tools highlights the need for a new ab initio approach, and the need for the panoramic view
aﬀorded by our VR examination.

Figure 8 shows the positions and velocities for stars in these four groups. We suggest that while 32 Or is similar
in position space and motion as Columba, Carina and Tuc-Hor, it is possible to distinguish it from these groups.
The mean velocity of Tuc-Hor with the Smethells 165 group removed is U = -9.944, V = -21.083, W = -0.524. In

comparison, the mean velocity of 32 Or is U = -10.3390794, V = -19.54700395, W = -8.901980704. Its velocity is
greater in the -W direction that that of the other groups and it does not overlap in position space in the middle panel.
We also did not ﬁnd any new candidate members of 32 Or, so we will not discuss it further.

Rather, based on Figures 8 and 9, along with our VR examination, we have decided to ﬁrst discuss Tuc-Hor, and

then discuss Carina and Columba as one combined association, Columba-Carina.

Figure 9 shows the X, Y, Z, U, V, W positions and motion of the Lee & Song (2019a) catalog. Let us begin by
ignoring the colors of the symbols, which may merely represent the history of how these YSAs were discovered. Now,
consider all the objects to be part of a single large group. With this perspective, we see a reasonably tight cluster in
velocity space; all but a handful of outliers lie within about 6 pc/Myr of one another. In position space, the stars are
spread over about 100 pc in Z, and 150 pc in X and Y. The upper right panel and the lower middle panels show hints
that the stars could be grouped into two separate clusters.

When we allow ourselves once again to consider the colors of the symbols, we see that the hint of a separation
between two groups places Tuc-Hor entirely into one group, but cleaves Columba in two in position space. In the
upper right panel about half of the Columba (blue) stars lie in the upper right next to the Tuc-Hor (turquoise) stars,
while the other half are towards the middle of the panel.

Of the three proposed groups, Tuc-Hor seems perhaps the most distinct, at least in velocity (it overlaps with Columba
in position). The Tuc-Hor stars (turquoise) are more tightly clustered in both position and velocity than either of
the other groups, especially once we ignore the four stars that we have labelled as “Smethells 165 group” (magenta).
Tuc-Hor stars clearly have the highest U, V, and W values (lower panels). The lower middle panel shows a possible
slight gap between the Tuc-Hor stars and the others. They overlap somewhat with Columba stars in terms of position,
but are relatively tightly constrained, occupying a range of only about 20 pc in Z.

5.1. Proposed Tucana-Horologium Association Members

Many authors have assembled catalogs of members of Tuc-Hor: Gagn´e et al. (2018b,c); Gagn´e & Faherty (2018) and
Schneider et al. (2019). Figure 10 shows the new inventory of Tuc-Hor by Lee & Song (2019a). Thanks to this work,
the core members of this group are relatively well deﬁned, and we do not have any new stars to add to the list of core
members.

Our VR examination revealed two infrared excess stars that are within about 60 pc of Tuc-Hor (HD 41992 and TYC
9196-2916-1), and have space velocities very similar to that of the group. We propose that they could be perhaps
former group members or members of an extended group corona. The Tuc-Hor association is elongated in the X
direction and compact in the Z direction; it is about 80 pc long in the X direction but only about 20 pc wide in Z.
The two new loosely associated members we propose (HD 41992 and TYC 9196-2916-1) extend the group mostly in
the Y direction.

Additionally, we advocate for the kinematic membership of the well-known disk host HD 15115 in Tuc-Hor; this

membership has been a matter of debate (see below).
HD 41992 (WISEA J060652.79-313054.1) is a F8V at 89 pc, ﬁrst identiﬁed as an infrared excess star by Disk
Detective, as mentioned in Silverberg et al. (2016). Our VR inspection suggests relationships between this star and
both Columba-Carina and Tuc-Hor; the star’s position places it closer to Columba-Carina, while its velocity resembles
that of Tuc Hor (Figure 10).
TYC 9196-2916-1 (WISEA J092521.90-673224.8) is a star of previously unknown spectral type at 100 pc, with
no previous mentions in the literature. Disk Detective identiﬁed an apparent infrared excess from this star, which
appears loosely associated with Tuc-Hor in our inspections. Our initial MCMC ﬁt to the photometry yielded a best
ﬁt stellar temperature of 4400 K, implying a mid-K spectral type. It also revealed excess emission in all four WISE
bands. Similar to HD 41992, our VR inspection suggests relationships between this star and both Columba-Carina and
Tuc-Hor; the star’s position places it closer to Columba-Carina, while its velocity resembles that of Tuc Hor (Figure
10). See Sections 6 and 7 for a more detailed discussion of this candidate “extreme debris disk” and its infrared excess.
HD 15115 (WISEA J022616.32+061732.8) F4 IV at 49 pc. Debes et al. (2008) estimated the star’s age to be
100—500 Myr, based on Ca ii H and K line indicators (Silverstone 2000), isochrone ﬁtting (Nordstr¨om et al. 2004),
and other indicators. Torres et al. (2008) proposed the star as a high probability member of β Pictoris, and Malo
et al. (2013) declared it a member of the β Pictoris moving group (age 24 Myr). Later, Gagn´e et al. (2018c) examined
it as a possible member of β Pictoris, but then rejected it as a bona ﬁde member of that group based on a visual
inspection. MacGregor et al. (2019) assigned it to Tuc-Hor based on BANYAN combined with Gaia coordinates and
radial velocity. Our BANYAN-independent VR simulation supports this last assignment. Figure 11 shows the position
and velocity of HD 15115 compared to the positions and velocities of β Pictoris and Tuc-Hor members from Lee &
Song (2019a). The middle and right and middle panels show how HD 15115 is a better ﬁt for Tuc-Hor.

5.2. A Group Containing Smethells 165

313054.1) is the red square, and another star, which is an extreme debris disk candidate (WISEA J092521.90-673224.8) is the
purple square. Three stars that had been called bona ﬁde members are shown in magenta. We propose that these three stars
could be members of another group with an age similar to that of Tuc-Hor. We are calling this new group the “Smethells 165
group” after the brightest of the three stars. HD 15115 (J022616.32+061732.8), which hosts a well-known edge-on debris disk,
is the dark teal square.

Figure 11. The well-known disk-hosting star HD 15115 (J022616.32+061732.8), shown as the dark teal square, was previously
identiﬁed as a member of β Pictoris. However, its velocity and position are a better match for Tuc-Hor, as the middle and right
panels of this ﬁgure reveal. Previously identiﬁed members of Tucana-Horologium (blue) and β Pictoris (turquoise) are from Lee
& Song (2019a) in XYZ (parsecs from the sun) with vectors showing UVW (parsecs/1000 years). The proposed Smethells 165
group is shown in magenta.

Our VR examination revealed that four previously identiﬁed Tuc-Hor members (2MASS J00240899-6211042, 2MASS
J21551140-6153119, 2MASS J23261069-7323498 and 2MASS J23285763-6802338) from the Lee & Song (2019a) catalog
match the group well in position space but do not match in velocity. One of these stars, 2MASS J21551140-6153119,
does not have parallax in EDR3 so we set it aside. However, we suggest that the remaining three stars, listed in Table
3, and colored magenta in Figures 8, 9, 10 and 11, may not belong to Tuc-Hor after all. The mean velocity of these 3
stars in parsecs per 1000 years is U = -13.460, V = -16.742, W = 4.627. Meanwhile, the mean velocity of the rest of
Tuc-Hor is U = -9.944, V = -21.083, W = -0.524.

We looked to see if perhaps these three stars might be better matched to another nearby YSA like β Pictoris,
Columba-Carina or 32 Or. However, our visual inspection in VR suggests that they do not belong to any other YSA.
They seem more likely to represent another new unknown group, perhaps with an age similar to Tuc-Hor, based on
the color magnitude diagram, Figure 12. We are calling this group the ”Smethells 165 group”. Notably, these 3 stars
are all M dwarfs (Torres et al. 2006; Riedel et al. 2017a).

5.3. Proposed Columba-Carina Members

Based on our VR examination, and analysis of Figures 8 and 9, we discuss Columba and Carina as one combined
association, Columba-Carina. Our VR inspections suggest that Lee & Song (2019a) lists of Carina and Columba
members need to be augmented with 6 additional members. These disk candidates are found in Table 1, and the

comover can be found in Table 2. Figure 13 shows the positions and motions of these disk candidates compared to the
Columba and Carina members listed by Lee & Song (2019a).

One star with an infrared excess that we propose as a new member of Columba-Carina has never been previously
identiﬁed with a YSA: CPD-57 937. A second star with an infrared excess that we propose as a new member of
Columba-Carina was previously proposed as a member of Tuc-Hor, but not of Columba or Carina: HD 10472. We
also found four other stars with infrared excesses that we assign to Columba-Carina that were previously proposed as
Columba-Carina members prior to Lee & Song (2019a): HD 30447, CPD-35 525, HD 35841, HD 10472 and HD 37852.
This last star, HD 37852, has an 83.5% likelihood of membership in Columba according to BANYAN Σ and a COL
candidate in Faherty et al. (2018) and appears in Silverberg et al. in prep. It has four comovers according to Oh et al.
(2017), which also likely belong to Columba-Carina.

CPD-57 937 (WISEA J060210.78-570142.1) This G5 star at 99 pc has not been previously proposed as a member
of any YSA. Its infrared excess was previously noted by Cotten & Song (2016) (on the “reserved” list, which consists of
stars with IR excess from Tycho-2/ALLWISE without trigonometric parallaxes, and distance calculated using a SED
ﬁtting algorithm). Our inspection supports the assignment of this star to the combined Columba-Carina association.

HD 10472 (WISEA J014024.15-605956.7) This star has never been assigned to Columba-Carina, but it has been
previously associated with Tuc-Hor Association by Mittal et al. (2015) and Meshkat et al. (2017). We ﬁnd Columba-

list, which consist of stars within 120 pc of the sun with IR excess from Tycho-2/ALLWISE). (Note that a footnote
in Esposito et al. (2020) suggests that others may have been considering re-assigning this object, but have not yet
published their work.)

HD 35841 (WISEA J052636.59-222923.8) is an F3 V at 103.7 pc. Elliott et al. (2016) listed this object as a
“candidate” member of Columba. Its infrared excess was previously noted by Cotten & Song (2016) (on the “prime”
list).
HD 30447 (WISEA J044649.55-261808.8): an F3 V at 81 pc. The debris disk around this star has been imaged
by HST NICMOS (Soummer et al. 2014) and VLT SPHERE (Lazzoni et al. 2018). Gagn´e et al. (2018c, 2021) listed
this star as a bona ﬁde Columba member, as did Malo et al. (2013). BANYAN Σ gives a probability of membership
in Columba of 99.5% However, Lee & Song (2019a) did not list it as a member of this group. Our inspection supports
the assignment of this star to the combined Columba-Carina association.
CPD-35 525 (WISEA J044115.76-351358.1) a G7 at 76 pc. This star was proposed as a candidate Columba
member in Gagn´e et al. (2018b) (and BANYAN Σ gives a probability of membership in Columba of 99.9%) but it is not
included as a member by Lee & Song (2019a). Its infrared excess was previously noted by Cotten & Song (2016)(on
their “prime” list). Our inspection supports the assignment of this star to the combined Columba-Carina association.

HD 37852 (WISEA J053930.48-404102.4) is a B8V at 93 pc. BANYAN Σ provides a probability of membership
in Columba of 83.5% for this star, so we discuss it further in Silverberg et al. (in prep). This star’s WISE excess was
ﬁrst identiﬁed by Wu et al. (2013). Oh et al. (2017) found HD 37852 to be comoving with four other stars, three of
which were included in Lee & Song (2019a) as members of Columba. The fourth of these comovers is HD 274311.

HD 274311 is a K5e at 105 pc. This star is listed as a ROSAT bright source by Haakonsen & Rutledge (2009). This
is part of Group 55 in Oh et al. (2017), which has only ﬁve members.

disk candidate J0925 (magenta), and previously identiﬁed members of Columba (blue) and Carina (green) from Lee & Song
(2019a) in XYZ (parsecs from the sun) with vectors showing UVW (parsecs/1000 years).

Figure 14 shows a CMD for Carina, Columba and Tuc-Hor, including the Gaia EDR3 ﬁeld main sequence, shown in
grey. The solid lines show isochrones at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 Myr from Marigo et al. (2017) available online5. The blue
dots show the previously-identiﬁed members of Columba, the green dots show Carina, and the turquoise dots show
Tuc-Hor, all from Lee & Song (2019a). The red x’s show our proposed new members: the red objects have infrared
excess, the orange x is co-moving with them, and the magenta x shows the proposed extreme debris disk.

Toward the reddest end, the members from Lee & Song (2019a) are found above the EDR3 ﬁeld, consistent with
the Bell et al. (2015) common age estimate of around 45 Myr. In general, the proposed new members are consistent
with the previously identiﬁed members. However, toward the blue end, where some new proposed members are, the
isochrones are degenerate, making it even harder to constrain the ages of the new proposed members. Once again,
this CMD highlights the trend that new members we discover using VR are often in a mass regime where isochrones
are degenerate, making them hard to identify as group members in an isochronal analysis.

6. DISCUSSION: SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS

Most of the infrared excess stars we identiﬁed as new YSA members only have signiﬁcant excess emission in the W4
band. The W1-W4 colors of all the stars are listed in Table 1. However two of the newly identiﬁed YSA members

show evidence for excess emission in multiple bands: J044115.76-351358.1 and J092521.90-673224.8. We modeled the
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for these two systems to help us better understand the distribution of circumstellar
material in them (Figure 15).

As an initial step in the modeling process, we iteratively ﬁt a BTSettl-CIFIST model (Baraﬀe et al. 2015) to
the observed photometry using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We initially ﬁt only the three Gaia DR2
photometry points and the 2MASS J point. Then we checked to see if the photometry in the next band (the shortest
wavelength not included in the ﬁt) was in excess (more than 5σ above the ﬂux predicted by the stellar model). If
that next longer band did not show an excess, we redid the ﬁt now including the photometry from this next longer
wavelength band, We continued this process, adding new bands to the ﬁt, until we either identiﬁed a photometric excess
or all bands except W3 and W4 were included in the ﬁt. This iterative method ensures that we did not accidentally
incorporate points in our ﬁt for the photosphere that contain excess emission. This model for the stellar photosphere
yields Teﬀ , log(g), and r(cid:63)/d, the ratio of stellar radius to distance.

Using these parameters derived from this model for the stellar photosphere, we then modeled the excess emission
using one or two blackbody functions, corresponding to one or two single-temperature dust belts. We ﬁt these to
the excess emission using MLE as well, ﬁnding for each dust belt the temperature Tdisk and xdisk, a parameter that
includes the number density of dust grains, the dust grain radius, and the optical depth of the dust. Once these
dust parameters were derived, we then re-ﬁt the entire system to ﬁnd the optimum values of the continuous variables
(rstar/d, Tdisk, xdisk, and in the case of a two-disk ﬁt Tdisk,2, xdisk,2) using maximum likelihood estimation, keeping
our best-ﬁt Teﬀ and log(g) constant. We adopted the parameters derived from this new ﬁt as our ﬁnal values for
the system. To estimate the uncertainties on these variables, we then ran a 5000-step Markov Chain Monte Carlo
routine using emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). This process yields the 5th and 95th percentile values for each of
the variables.

For the ﬁrst system, J044115.76-351358.1, the star is best ﬁt as a 5500 K G-type star, and the infrared excess is
−23 K, and best ﬁt LIR/L(cid:63)

well-ﬁt with a single-temperature blackbody. The excess has a best ﬁt temperature of 253+39
of 6.27+0.69

−0.74 × 10−4. These values are typical for warm debris disks.

The second star, TYC 9196-2916-1 (J092521.90-673224.8), merits a longer discussion. As Figure 15 shows, the
infrared excess has multiple components. Additionally, the best-ﬁt temperature and log(g) from our initial process
(Teﬀ = 4400 K, log(g) = 3.5) signiﬁcantly disagree with the spectroscopically-derived values for the star (Teﬀ =
4607 ± 85K, log(g) = 4.49 ± 0.18) from the third data release from the Galactic Archaeology with Hermes project
(GALAH DR3; Buder et al. 2021), suggesting that interstellar extinction plays a signiﬁcant role for this source.
To account for this extinction, we used the Virtual Observatory SED Analyzer (VOSA; Bayo et al. 2008), which

DENIS. Each star is ﬁt by a BT-Settl/CIFIST stellar model (Baraﬀe et al. 2015), and the infrared excess is modeled by one
or two blackbody functions. Data for J0925 are dereddened following the Fitzpatrick (1999) dereddening law as modiﬁed by
Indebetouw et al. (2005). Note that the hot component of the excess emission from J0925 is variable, according to WISE
photometry.

incorporates extinction, to ﬁt all available photometry at a wavelength shorter than 1 µm, avoiding photometry that
could be signiﬁcantly impacted by the observed excess. We again used BT-Settl/CIFIST models, using only those
models within 100 K of the Teﬀ and 1 dex of the log(g) for the source found in GALAH DR3, to obtain a best-ﬁt stellar
model and extinction. We then used this best-ﬁt model and extinction, and ﬁt the excess with blackbody functions as
described above.

−13 K and 1108+278

We found that the best-ﬁt model for this source was an SED with a two-component blackbody excess, with tempera-
tures 150+37
−393 K and a total LIR,warm/L(cid:63) ≈ 1.6 × 10−2 and LIR,hot/L(cid:63) ≈ 2.1 × 10−2. Using equation 3
from Backman & Paresce (1993) and our best-ﬁt temperatures and stellar luminosity (L(cid:63) ≈ 0.267L(cid:12)), the blackbody
radius of the outer disk for J0925 is ∼ 1.77 AU, while the blackbody radius for the inner disk is ∼ 0.03 AU. We also
derive a surface area for the warm disk of ∼ 0.63 AU2, and for the hot disk of ∼ 3 × 10−4 AU2. Assuming 10-micron
silicate grains, the dust mass of the warm disk is ∼ 8 × 10−3 lunar masses, while the dust mass of the hot disk is
∼ 3 × 10−6 lunar masses. This ignores larger bodies (e.g. comets) that could contain the bulk of the mass.

7. J0925: AN EXTREME DEBRIS DISK

The Disk Detective citizen science project originally classiﬁed TYC 9196-2916-1 (J092521.90-673224.8) as a “mul-
tiple,” probably because of the DSS Blue, Red and IR images, which show two background sources, roughly 8 arcsec
away. Disk Detective was constructed to search for stars with reliable excess at W4, and objects at this separation
would be potential sources of confusion in W4 band. However, this object has a strong excess at W3 and W4, and
those background sources are not visible at all in either 2MASS or WISE images, so they could not be contributing at
all to the excess at W3, and probably do not substantially contribute to the W4 excess either.

We triple checked the images of this star (also known as subject AWI00063mu in the Disk Detective v1 catalog) for
contamination using IRSA ﬁnderchart, and found none. This star is too far south to have images in the Pan-STARRS
archive. The nearest star in Gaia eDR3 is 11 arcsec; for comparison, WISE channels 1, 2, and 3 all have point spread
functions with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of about 6 arcsec, while WISE channel 4 has a FWHM of
about 12 arcsec. The star was classiﬁed by citizen scientists Jonathan Holden and Phillip Griﬃth Sr.

Intriguingly, this star is reported as an emission line star by ˇCotar et al. (2021) based on a spectrum from the
GALactic Archaeology with Hermes (GALAH) survey. This paper initially led us to speculate that J0925 could be
hosting a Peter Pan disk, even though it is a K type star. Other known Peter Pan disk hosts are primarily M stars,
which may be a consequences of disk dispersal physics (Wilhelm & Portegies Zwart 2021). However, an inspection of
the GALAH spectrum (Figure 17) shows Hα to clearly be in absorption rather than emission, indicating that there is
likely no ongoing accretion.

Curiously, the ALLWISE variability ﬂags for J092521.90-673224.8 indicate that this source is variable in W 1, W 2,
and W 3. This variability is similar to that seen for the hot-temperature component of the Peter Pan disk W0808
(Murphy et al. 2018), in that it appears correlated in the W 1 and W 2 bands (with limited time-series data available

images, implying that they do not explain the large excess emission measured in W3 and W4 bands.

at W 3 compared with the data available at W 1 and W 2 from NEOWISE-R), with variations ∼ 0.392 mags in both
W1 and W2. However, such variability is also thought to be an inherent characteristic of extreme debris disks (Meng
et al. 2012; Su et al. 2019; Mo´or et al. 2021). Indeed, looking at the WISE data in terms of “excess fraction” (i.e. the
stellar-photosphere-subtracted ﬂux as a fraction of the ﬂux from the photosphere) shows variations of ∼ 40% at W1
and ∼ 50% of the underlying ﬂux at W2. By comparison, Su et al. (2019) found variations of ∼ 20% at 3.6 µm and
∼ 60% at 4.5 µm for the ID8 system, which correspond to the lower temperature of the “hot” excess in that system
compared to J0925. This indicates that J0925 can quite reasonably be explained as an extreme debris disk.

Balog et al. (2009), Meng et al. (2015), and Mo´or et al. (2021) describe extreme debris disks (EDDs) as warm disk-
hosting stars between 10 and 200 Myr in age, with unusually high fractional luminosities and strong mid-IR excess
emission. The dust temperature of these EDDs are found to be > 300K, and the fractional luminosity > 0.01 is about
three orders of magnitude higher than normally found in debris disks (Balog et al. (2009) in Mo´or et al. (2021)). The
high dust luminosity could be due to recent collision events and their aftermath Schneider et al. (2013). Relatively
few EDDs are known; (Mo´or et al. 2021) lists a sample of “all known EDDs” containing only 17 stars.

We are not aware of any other K type extreme debris disks in Columba-Carina. However, the F5V Columba member
HD 35841 hosts a debris disk with a fractional infrared excess of LIR/L(cid:63) ≈ 10−3. Much of this excess arises from a
narrow circular ring at r = 19-20 au, based on images from HST and Gemini (Esposito et al. 2018). For comparison,
J0925 appears to have more dust with an LIR/L(cid:63) ≈ 16 times that of HD 35841.

Higashio et al.

Other young stellar associations do have K-type stars with extreme debris disks. Zuckerman (2015) discovered V488
Per, a K-type star with an age of 90 Myr. With a characteristic temperature of ∼ 800 K, this dust orbits only ∼ 0.06
au from the star (assuming blackbody grains). This star appears to have more dust with a LIR/L(cid:63) of ∼ 0.16 which is
≈ 10 times that of J0925.

Another interesting K star with an extreme debris disk is TYC 8241-2652-1, a K2V in LCC (Goldman et al. 2018).
Curiously, the mid-IR luminosity of this star was observed to decay signiﬁcantly over less than two years. It began
with a warm (∼ 450K), unusually dust-rich disk with a LIR/L(cid:63) ≈ 0.11, and evolved into a colder (< 200K), more
tenuous disk with a LIR/L(cid:63) ∼ 10−3 (Melis et al. 2012). Pecaut & Mamajek (2016) found this star to have a spectral
type of K3IV(e), and assigned it to the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, with an age of 14 Myr. For comparison,
J0925 appears to be in between the two extremes of this star in terms of luminosity of its disk.

8. THEIA GROUPS

The moving groups discussed above are clustered in position, velocity and age. But Kounkel & Covey (2019) drew
attention to the notion of diﬀuse moving groups, clustered in velocity and age but relatively unclustered in position.
Kounkel & Covey (2019) used unsupervised machine learning on Gaia DR2 data to ﬁnd 1901 such diﬀuse groups of
co-moving stars, calling them “Theia” groups.

Subsequently, Gagn´e et al. (2021, GFMP21) proposed that fourteen of these Theia groups may be kinematically
related to the YSAs discussed in Section 4 and 5. This observation led GFMP21 to suggest that some of these moving
groups are possibly tidal tails from more distant open clusters. In the process, GFMP21 found that several of the disk
candidates and co-moving stars listed in Tables 1 and 2 could be associated with Theia groups: Theia 92, Theia 208
and Theia 301. Here is a summary of these assignments suggested by GFMP21.

HD 41992/WISEA J060652.79-313054.1 - GFMP21 assigned this object to Theia 208, which they argued is likely
related to Columba and Carina. We found that this star has a position consistent with membership in Columba-Carina,
but a velocity consistent with membership in Tuc-Hor, as shown in Figure 10.

HD 35841/WISEA J052636.59-222923.8 - GFMP21 assigned this star to Theia 208.

HD 274311/Gaia DR2 4806146576925723264 - GFMP21 found this object to be part of Group 55 in Oh et al.
(2017), which has only ﬁve members. Group 55 is near Theia 208, but not part of it.

HD 44775/WISEA J062218.66-295134.7 - GFMP21 assigned this star to Theia 301; Kounkel & Covey (2019)
and GFMP21 suggested that Theia 301 might be related to AB Doradus.

HD 40540/WISEA J055752.60-342834.1 - same as above.

HD 44510/WISEA J061903.93-535823.9 - same as above.

TYC 6518-1857-1/Gaia DR2 2898402643271131264 - same as above.

CPD-25 1292/Gaia DR2 2911909593862390912 - same as above.

9. CONCLUSIONS

We examined eight nearby young moving groups using a novel VR technique, and found seven new likely disk-hosting
members of these groups. Each one of these stars is likely to be a valuable target for coronagraphic imaging. The
infrared excesses for most of our objects of interest had been previously identiﬁed in other searches, except for two
stars, which Disk Detective ﬁrst identiﬁed as having infrared excess (J092521.90-673224.8 and J060652.79-313054.1).
We also identiﬁed four other likely new members of these moving groups that do not have disks, but which are comovers
with other new members. We suggested that three M dwarfs, previously considered members of Tuc-Hor are better
considered a separate moving group, tentatively called Smethells 165.

These ﬁndings demonstrate the value of new visual examinations of the shapes and memberships of these moving
groups, and VR as a tool for performing such examinations. Note that none of these objects was identiﬁed by BANYAN
Σ as a high probability group member (we are saving a discussion of group members identiﬁed via BANYAN Σ for a
future paper). Furthermore, our VR technique identiﬁed new candidate members often found in a mass regime where
isochrones are degenerate, which highlights the unique value that the VR tool demonstrates in this area.

The new proposed group members include two stars (J092521.90-673224.8 and HD 41992) with positions consistent
with membership in Columba-Carina, but velocities consistent with membership in Tuc-Hor. They may have been
neglected by earlier studies for exactly this reason. One of these, TYC 9196-2916-1 (J092521.90-673224.8), appears

to host an extreme debris disk with a two-component infrared excess of LIR,warm/L(cid:63) ≈ 1.6 × 10−2 and LIR,hot/L(cid:63) ≈
2.1 × 10−2. Its characteristics are not unusual when compared to other K-type extreme debris disks.

Since we completed this work, Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) has come out, and a new version of the Disk
Detective citizen science project has launched. Disk Detective 2.0 utilizes the Zooniverse Panoptes platform, and
targets a Gaia-selected sample of nearby systems as opposed to a photometrically-selected sample. This updated
project has the express goals of ﬁnding new YSA members and new Peter Pan disks. We expect VR to help us with
this second generation project as well.
