ABSTRACT

We present mean reddenings toward 3525 RR0 Lyrae stars from the Galactic
bulge ﬁelds of the MACHO Survey. These reddenings are determined using
the color at minimum V -band light of the RR0 Lyrae stars themselves and are
found to be in general agreement with extinction estimates at the same location
obtained from other methods. Using 3256 stars located in the Galactic Bulge, we
derive the selective extinction coeﬃcient RV,V R = AV /E(V −R) = 4.3±0.2. This
value is what is expected for a standard extinction law with RV,BV = 3.1 ± 0.3.

Introduction

Studies of stars in the central Galactic region are essential for an understanding of the
Milky Way. For example, the questions of the structure and extent of the Galactic bar, the
star formation history, and the distance to the center of our Galaxy can all be answered by
analyzing various stellar tracers. Knowledge of the Galactic extinction is mandatory to begin
investigations of these stars in a quantitative fashion. A good understanding of extinction is
particularly important for the direction toward the Galactic Bulge and within the Galactic
plane, where extinction is very signiﬁcant.

Extinction Aλ changes as a function of wavelength λ. The shape of the extinction curve
is characterized by the quantity RV , the ratio of total to selective extinction; Cardelli et al.
(1989) have shown that the family of curves characterized by this single parameter provides
a good ﬁtting approximation to most extinction curves. Thus, if the value of RV can be
determined (e.g., from optical and IR photometry), then one can approximately ﬁnd the
properties of the entire UV-IR extinction curve.

There are a few suggestions that the coeﬃcient of selective extinction in the direction of
the Galactic Bulge may be non-standard (e.g. Popowski 2000). Anomalous extinction, i.e.,
extinction described by smaller RV,BV or RV,V R ratio than the standard value of RV,BV =
3.1, can signiﬁcantly aﬀect analysis of the stellar populations in the Galactic Bulge. Here,
RV,BV is the coeﬃcient of selective extinction AV /E(B − V ), with reference to the B and
V ﬁlters, and RV,V R = AV /E(V − R), alluding to the V and R ﬁlters. Especially with the
onset of a new generation of large telescopes, this problem becomes increasingly pressing and
important, and one that can be addressed with this study. Here, optical V and R-band data
for 3256 RR0 Lyrae stars1 from the MACHO microlensing experiment are used to ﬁnd both
the coeﬃcient of selective extinction and to compute the absolute reddening near the Galactic
bulge/bar. The value of RV,BV is known to vary in certain directions, and reddening laws
are normally derived from diﬀerential measurements of reddened and unreddened luminous
early-type stars. However, as such stars are rare in the Galactic Bulge, the normal derivation
of RV,BV can not be carried out. The RV,BV values determined from the RR Lyrae stars are
compared with other reddening relations.

The data used in this analysis are based on the MACHO photometry of 3674 RR0
Lyrae stars toward the Galactic Bulge. Cook, Kunder, & Popowski (2007, in preparation).
Cook et al. (2007, in preparation) divide the MACHO bulge RR0 Lyrae variables into those

associated with the Galactic Bulge (3256 stars), and the ones associated with the neighboring
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (409 stars). Their classiﬁcation is assumed in this work.

The structure of this paper is the following. The method and resultant coeﬃcient of
selective extinction toward the Bulge is discussed and compared to other estimates in §2.
Reddenings of the Bulge RR0 Lyrae stars are determined in §3 using their minimum V-
band light colors These reddenings are then compared to Popowski et al. (2003) reddening
estimates and the outliers are discussed.

2. Coeﬃcient of Selective Extinction

2.1. General approach

As the bulge RR Lyrae stars span a much larger range in color than Sgr ones, a coeﬃcient
of selective extinction is determined using only this subsample. Assuming that the extinction
aﬀects the V magnitudes much more signiﬁcantly than the distance spread, the intrinsic
scatter in absolute magnitudes, and the scatter due to various observational errors, the
slope of the stellar locus on a VRR (mean V magnitudes of the RR Lyrae stars) versus
(V − R)RR (mean color of the RR Lyrae stars) color-magnitude diagram (CMD) yields
RV,V R ≡ AV /E(V − R) (Kunder et al. 2006). In other words, if in the distance modulus,

VRR − MV − AV = 5 log(d)

(1)

we assume MV and d is approximately constant, then the apparent magnitude, VRR, is
proportional to AV :

VRR ∼ AV ∼

E(V − R)
RV,V R

.

Taking the (V − R)0 of each RR0 Lyrae star to be approximately constant,

VRR ∼

(V − R)RR
RV,V R

which is in the form of a general linear equation with VRR as the independent variable,
(V − R)RR as the dependent variable, and RV,V R as the slope. It is shown in the following
section that the above conditions are approximately met.

Figure 1 is a plot of mean VRR, versus mean (V − R)RR. Artiﬁcial star tests from
Alcock et al. (1999) indicate that the limiting magnitude of the photometry in the V and R
band is about 21.5, which is 0.5 magnitudes fainter than the faintest RR Lyrae star in this
MACHO Bulge sample. The Monte Carlo analysis discussed later in this section indicates
the limiting magnitude has little eﬀect on this paper’s analysis.

(2)

– 4 –

The sources contributing to the intrinsic dispersions of the average V and R apparent
magnitudes are now discussed and quantiﬁed following the approach from Clementini et al.
(2003) .

1. photometric errors. Since many MACHO ﬁelds partly overlap on the sky, some
stars may be counted in the database twice. Using 184 double-represented stars, the internal
photometric uncertainty in (V −R), V , and R was found by comparing colors and magnitudes
evaluated in diﬀerent ﬁelds. For the MACHO data toward the Galactic Bulge, the individual
error in VRR is ± 0.15 mag and the individual error in (V − R)RR is 0.04 (Cook et al. 2008,
in preparation). 2 As the error in VRR and (V − R)RR are correlated, upon multiplying the
error in (V − R)RR, (0.04 mags), by the slope of the ﬁt, (4.28), this value is added to the
error in VRR. The photometric error in the points in Figure 1 is thus 0.32 mags.

2. absolute magnitude of RR Lyrae stars. It is generally assumed that the absolute
magnitude of an RR Lyrae star has a linear dependence on [F e/H], and that ∆MV (RR)
/ ∆[F e/H] = 0.2 mag dex−1. The dispersion around the mean value of [Fe/H] = -1.00
dex found in Galactic Bulge RR Lyrae stars is σV = 0.29 mag. (Kunder et al. 2007, in
preparation). This corresponds to an absolute magnitude dispersion of about 0.06 mag.

The level of evolution oﬀ the zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB) can also aﬀect at RR
Lyrae star’s absolute magnitude. From the vertical height of the HB of a number of globular
clusters of diﬀerent metallicities, the dispersion around the average RR Lyrae luminosity
due to the evolution oﬀ the ZAHB of each individual RR Lyrae is estimated as ∼ 0.08 mag
(Clementini et al. 2003; Sandage 1990) .

The scatter in RR Lyrae absolute magnitude due to evolutionary phase, helium content,

and alpha-element abundance [α/Fe], are less signiﬁcant and are not accounted for.

3. bulge distance spread.

Using the standard Hernquist model density proﬁle with a scale length, characteristic
density, and characteristic velocity of the bulge from Widrow & Dubinski (2005) Table 2,
the size of the bulge is ∼ 1 kpc. As the galactic latitude and longitude of the MACHO bulge
ﬁelds ranges from -1.5◦ to - 10◦ and 0◦ to 10◦, respectively, a correction between the line of
sight of the RR Lyrae stars in the bulge ﬁelds and the plane of the galaxy is negligible. A
distance spread of 1 kpc corresponds to a ∆V of ∼ 0.29 mags.

Adding in quadrature all dispersion contributions, the scatter in V for a ﬁxed (V − R)

Alcock et al. (1999), especially pgs. 1547 and 1551.

– 5 –

is 0.44 mags, with the major source of this scatter resulting from the extent of the bulge
along the line of sight.

Fitting a straight line to the data must be done with caution, since errors are present in
both independent and dependent variables and are furthermore correlated with each other.
Ordinary least squares (OLS), which assumes no error in the independent variable, can
therefore not be used here. Instead a straight line ﬁt to the data is obtained using an OLS
bisector ﬁt to the individual data points.

The OLS-bisector method has been used when both variables are subject to measure-
ment error and it is not clear which variable should be treated as the independent and
which as the dependent. It has been shown to outperform other approaches in such cases
(Babu & Feigelson 1992; Isobe et al. 1990). Using the SLOPES program (Feigelson & Babu
1992), the data are ﬁt using the OLS-bisector method. The slope found is 4.28 ± 0.04 and is
shown as a solid line in Figure 1. Upon restricting the ﬁt to those stars with (V −R) > 0.34, a
slope of 4.34±0.04 is obtained. A further cut to remove the very red stars with (V −R) > 1.1,
yields a slope of 4.49 ± 0.05. These ﬁt values are given in Table 1; the RV,V R chosen as the
optimal regression is RV,V R = 4.28, as it accounts for all data values. Table 1 shows that the
slope is quite sensitive to just a few points, although these formal errors for the OLS-bisector
method are quite small. The error in RV,V R of ±0.2 is chosen to encompass the range of
slopes.

The OLS-bisector ﬁt to our data is further investigated with a simple Monte Carlo
analysis. To duplicate the observed RR0 Lyrae data in this paper, 3500 E(V − R) values
between 0 and 1.5 are randomly selected. E(V − R) is converted to Av using a selective
extinction coeﬃcient, RV,V R, which we vary. Assuming an RR Lyrae absolute magnitude
of MV = 0.6 and a distance to the Bulge of 8 kpc, an observed V magnitude is found. As
the observed V magnitudes in the MACHO data have an error of ∼ 0.5 mags, Gaussian
random numbers are generated with a dispersion of 0.5 mags, and added to the simulated
V magnitudes. Using (V − R) = E(V − R) + 0.28, and assuming the uncertainty in the
measured (V − R) colors is 0.05 magnitudes, the simulated V magnitudes can be plotted as
a function of simulated (V-R) magnitudes. We make sure this simulated plot looks similar
to Figure 1.

Next a cut is made to remove all stars which have V and R magnitudes less than 21.5.
The OLS-bisector method is then used to derive the slope of the ﬁt before and after the
magnitude cut. We ﬁnd there is no signiﬁcant change in the value of the slope after the cut.
However, the slope found using the OLS-bisector method is not always the value of the slope
that was input. This has implications on the derived RV,V R value. Apparently the errors
in the photometry in this paper are suﬃcient to throw oﬀ the OLS-bisector ﬁt for a given

– 6 –

value.

Figure 2 shows the diﬀerence in the true RV,V R value and the OLS-bisector slope,
R(V,V R)-OLS slope, as a function of the true RV,V R value. The scatter in this plot is mainly
due to the errors in the V -magnitudes and (V − R) colors. A slope with a value of ∼ 4.6
exhibits the least amount of deviation between the true and calculated RV,V R value. The
RV,V R value found in this paper is close to 4.6, so the slope found by the OLS-bisector method
should not be signiﬁcantly biased. Even values well above and below 4.6 do not diﬀer from
the true RV,V R value by more than 0.2 mags. Other simulations with somewhat diﬀerent
input parameters (e.g., uncertainty in photometry) are performed and results similar, but
not identical to Figure 2, are found. Thus, we can not simply correct the slope that is ob-
tained from the real data using these simulations. Thus, an uncertainty of 0.2 in the RV,V R
is adopted.

2.2. Comparisons and Consistency

It is an interesting question how this RV,V R value from the MACHO RR Lyrae stars
compares with other reddening relations. Reddening relations determined from broad band
photometric data depend on the intrinsic spectral energy distributions of the objects used
to determine them as well as the particular ﬁlters. The MACHO bM and rM ﬁlters are
considerably diﬀerent from Johnson V and Kron-Cousins R.

To compare our results to the standard extinction curve, the Fitzpatrick (1999) ex-
tinction curve with a constant total-to-selective extinction parameter, RV,BV = 3.1, is used
with the PHOENIX model synthetic spectra (Hauschildt, Allard & Baron 1999). The John-
son BVR transmission curves from Bessell (1990) yield RV,V R = 4.88 for Tef f = 6000 K,
RV,V R = 4.92 for Tef f = 7000 K and RV,V R = 5.07 for Tef f = 30000 K. An eﬀective temper-
ature of 6000 K - 7000 K is typical of RR Lyrae stars, and an eﬀective temperature of 30000
K is typical of early type stars. The synthetic spectra adopted is one with [Fe/H] = −1.0
and logg = 2.5, but varying [Fe/H] and surface gravity does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the RV,V R
values.

The MACHO bM and rM ﬁlters are non-standard, but were transformed into the Johnson
V and Kron-Cousins R as described in Alcock et al. (1999). We simulated this procedure
by using the MACHO bM and rM transmission curves and our synthetic spectra to obtain
MACHO bM and rM magnitudes. These were then converted using the Alcock et al. (1999)
transformation. It is found that RV,V R = 4.34 for Tef f = 6000 K, and RV,V R = 4.26 for
Tef f = 7000 K. Both these values are in agreement with the value obtained in this analysis.

– 7 –

In comparison, a RV,BV = 2.5 would yield RV,V R = 3.77.

Reddening laws are normally derived from diﬀerential measurement of reddened and
unreddened luminous early-type stars. But such stars are absent in the Galactic Bulge. This
analysis uses Population II type stars and indicates that the reddening law in the bulge is on
average similar to the standard solar neighborhood value of RV,BV = 3.1. Changing RV,BV
to e.g. a non-standard value, does signiﬁcantly aﬀect the measured RV,V R. Quantitatively,
it is found that the change in RV,V R is 68% of the change in RV,BV .

Using Galactic bulge Red Clump Giants from the OGLE dataset, Udalski (2003) present
substantial evidence that the ratio of total to selective absorption, RV,V I, is much smaller
toward the Galactic Bulge than the value corresponding to the standard extinction curve
and that RV,BV varies considerably along diﬀerent lines of sight. Their value of RV,V I ∼
2.1, as opposed to the standard value of about 2.5, corresponds to an RV,BV of about 2.6.
Stanek (1996) constructed extinction and reddening maps for Baade’s window from color-
magnitude diagrams obtained by OGLE which showed that extinction in Baade’s window
is quite irregular, varying between 1.3 and 2.8 mag in AV,BV , with an estimated error of ∼
0.1 mag. Ruﬄe et al. (2004) use 70 Galactic planetary nebulae observed using narrow-band
ﬁlters to ﬁnd observed < RV,BV > = 2.0 toward the bulge.

The RV,V R value determined from the RR Lyrae stars above, indicates that the standard
Galactic reddening law can in general be adopted in studies of objects toward the bulge. We
caution that the value of RV,BV can vary in certain directions but that on average, the
standard reddening law can be used.

3. Reddening

3.1. Determination of intrinsic (V − R)0 colors

Sturch (1966) and Blanco (1992) argue that apparent (B − V ) colors of RR Lyrae stars
at phases close to the minimum light can be utilized to measure the amount of interstellar
reddening along the line of sight to the star since the intrinsic (B − V )0 colors seem constant
in the phase interval 0.5 – 0.8. Mateo et al. (1995) suggest that (V − I) colors might also be
used, perhaps with a smaller or negligible metallicity correction. We investigate this further
for (V − R) colors below.

The colors at minimum light, (V − R)0, can be computed via two diﬀerent methods. In
the ﬁrst method, the Fourier ﬁts to both V and R-band data are used to average the colors,
in magnitude units, for phases between 0.5 and 0.8. However, we ﬁnd that when (V − R)0

– 8 –

is determined using this method, it correlated with amplitude. In the second method, the
(V − R) color is found at minimum V -band light. Kanbur & Fernando (2004) used this
technique and found that intrinsic color at minimum V -band light is nearly independent
of period and V -band variation amplitude. Since this method yields (V − R)0 values that
are very weakly correlated with amplitude, this is the method employed here. Table 2
presents our determination of unreddened (V − R)0 colors for eleven well observed ﬁeld RR0
variables (the data in Table 2 come from Liu & Janes 1989; Cacciari et al. 1987; and Layden
2005, private communication). The color excess, E(V − R), is computed by multiplying
the published E(B − V ) values by the ratio of RV,BV /RV,V R = 3.315/5.16, where the values
RV,BV = 3.315 and RV,V R = 5.16 are taken from Schlegel et al. (1998).3 A plot of E(V − R)
vs (V − R) has a linear character. This is quite remarkable, considering some of these stars
exhibit the Blazhko eﬀect (e.g., AW And), some are aﬀected by both the Blazhko eﬀect
and a ”phase-lag” problem (e.g., SS For), and some have evidence of shock waves in their
atmospheres (e.g., RV Phe, V440 Sgr) as discussed by Cacciari et al. (1989a), Cacciari et al.
(1989b). It has been shown that in many RR Lyrae stars the Blazhko eﬀect does not aﬀect
colors at minimum light, making this method robust. We conclude that the mean (V − R)0
color of RR0 Lyrae stars at minimum V -band light is 0.28 ± 0.02. Table 2 suggests that the
intrinsic color at minimum light is independent or at least very insensitive to metallicity.

3.2. Reddening toward the bulge RR Lyrae stars

The observed and intrinsic colors at minimum V -band are put forth to determine the

color excess of the bulge RR0 Lyrae stars:

E(V − R) = (V − R) − (V − R)0.

(4)

The Fourier ﬁts performed to ﬁnd (V −R) color at minimum V -band light are sensitive to
the quality of a lightcurve. To insure high E(V − R) accuracy without sacriﬁcing the sample
size, the Fourier ﬁts in both passbands for all stars are individually examined. Only those
with ﬁts that approximated the RR Lyrae light curve nicely are taken (i.e., if the Fourier
method mimicked features in the RR Lyrae lightcurve well, such as the dip and sharp rise
of the curve at minimum light). This criterion results in 3525 RR0 Lyrae stars with well
determined reddening values. Example entries of this reddening catalog are presented in
Table 3; the complete listing is available in the electronic version.

3We explicitly assume here that for this sample of RR Lyrae stars, extinction is on average well represented

by the standard RV,BV value.

– 9 –

Multiplying the 3525 E(V − R)RR values by the selective extinction coeﬃcient, RV,V R,
allows the determination of the visual extinction. A map of the visual extinction, AV , is
shown in Figure 3. As Popowski et al. (2003) also remark, it is immediately obvious that on
large scales, extinction is regularly stratiﬁed parallel to the Galactic plane.

To determine the distance modulus to the Galactic Bulge from the RR0 Lyrae stars,
an RR Lyrae absolute magnitude of MV = 0.59 ± 0.03 at [Fe/H] = −1.5 as compiled by
If a metallicity dependence of MV = (0.25 ±
Cacciari & Clementini (2003) is adopted.
0.05)[Fe/H]+constant is adopted (consistent with the range of slopes found in the literature),
then using the average metallicity of [Fe/H] = −1 from above, an MV = 0.72 ± 0.04 for RR
Lyrae stars in the Bulge is obtained. This predicts (m − M)0 = 14.7 ± 0.1 for Bulge RR
Lyrae. Adopting the RR Lyrae statistical parallax calibration of MV = 0.77 ± 0.13 at
[Fe/H] = −1.6 from Gould & Popowski (1998), then using the same metallicity dependence,
an (m − M)0 = 14.5 ± 0.16 for RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic Bulge is predicted. This is
identical to the Galactocentric distance modulus measured by Eisenhauer et al. (2003) from
the orbit of a star around the central black hole.

3.3. Comparison with complementary MACHO determination

In this subsection the reddenings obtained here are tested against Popowski et al. (2003)
values, which are based on photometry from the MACHO bulge ﬁelds. The MACHO data of
the Galactic Bulge are based on observations of 94 bulge ﬁelds, each ﬁeld covering an area of
43’ by 43’. Popowski et al. (2003) use 4’ x 4’ sky regions (tiles) as resolution elements. They
show that mean colors for these tiles can be converted to extinction, and can thus be used
to derive a visual extinction map. Each RR0 Lyrae star is matched with the corresponding
tile, and the color excess, E(V − R)RR, of the line of sight to the RR0 Lyrae star is compared
to the Popowski et al. (2003), E(V − R)CMD, as calibrated to Stanek (1996) extinction4.
Figure 4 shows this linear relationship, with the line of slope unity over-plotted. The E(V −
R)RR values become larger than E(V − R)CMD when reddening increases, which could mean
the Popowski et al. (2003) extinction map underestimates the extinction in areas with high
reddening. Performing the Bessell & Germany (1999) calibration to the MACHO RR Lyrae
lightcurve data does not alter this result. An increase in scatter is expected in stars with high
reddenings, since generally a redder RR0 Lyrae star is fainter and is more likely to have noisy
photometry and lightcurves. Especially near the Galactic center, diﬀerential reddening due

redder than E(V − R)CMD calibrated to Stanek (1996).

– 10 –

to nonuniform distribution of the intervening dust on small spatial scales makes the study of
the stellar population diﬃcult even in the infrared (see, e.g., Narayanan et al. 1996; Davidge
1998). Frogel et al. (1999) show in their Figure 5, that the amount of diﬀerential reddening
in a ﬁeld is directly proportional to the average reddening: the more reddening present in
a ﬁeld, the more patchy that reddening is. As the Popowski et al. (2003) extinction map is
based on the average color of 4’ x 4’ sky regions, their average colors and hence reddenings
would be susceptible to diﬀerential reddening, explaining the slight discrepancy between
their reddenings and ours at higher reddenings.

What could cause the systematic bias in the E(V − R)RR values to become larger than
the E(V − R)CMD as the reddening increases? Popowski et al. (2003) perform a calibration
to Stanek (1996) extinction and this calibration assumes a uniform RV,BV value. This as-
sumption does not hold, however, since the extinction toward the Bulge has nonstandard
properties (Popowski 2000). Udalski (2003) ﬁnd that the diﬀerence between the measured
line of sight RV,V I, and the standard value of RV,V I depends on color. Furthermore, they ﬁnd
that this diﬀerence is larger for redder V − I colors and practically negligible in the range
where the OGLE data were calibrated by standards (V − I < 2). Similarly, the diﬀerence in
the coeﬃcient of selective extinction RV,V R and the standard RV,V R would also increase with
increasing V − R and hence with increasing E(V − R)CM D (since Popowski et al. (2003) uses
the average color to determine E(V − R)CM D). As the Popowski et al. (2003) E(V − R)CM D
calibration neglects a change in RV,V R with increasing color, at higher E(V − R)CM D the
values will be underestimated.

3.3.1. Outliers

The most obvious outlier in Figure 4 is the RR0 Lyrae star that is designated in the
MACHO database as 175.30921.95. It has a negative E(V −R)RR, which is unphysical. It has
a period, amplitude and light curve shape that conﬁrm it is a fundamental mode pulsator.
However, as is clear from its position on a color-magnitude diagram, with (V − R) = 0.21
it is one of the bluest stars in the dataset (see Figure 1). Sturch (1966) suggests that as
many as 3% of the RR0 Lyrae stars may have an unusual blueness associated with them.
The only stars with a color bluer than this star and with an R-band lightcurve suitable for
reddening determination, are stars 125.23192.175 and 117.26079.4609, with (V − R) = 0.14
and (V − R) = 0.19, respectively. The bluer of these two stars’ E(V − R)RR deviates
by 0.3 mag from E(V − R)CM D, while the other one by only 0.06 mag. Other very blue
stars include 129.26623.1139 with (V − R) = 0.24 and 146.28412.88 with (V − R) = 0.25,
but their E(V − R)RR is in agreement with E(V − R)CM D. One more characteristic that

– 11 –

distinguishes the blue outlying stars 175.30921.95 and 125.23192.175 from their blue non-
outlying counterparts, is the fact that these stars have periods that lie in the range 0.469-
0.472 days, a range in which unstable light curves are common (Kinman & Carretta 1992).
Spectra of unusually blue stars in the period interval of 0.469-0.472 days, AR Her and BB

stars have systematically stronger hydrogen lines at minimum light than all the other stars,
indicating a higher temperature. The cause of the higher temperature, however, remains
unknown. Fernley & Barnes (1996) suggested that BB Vir could be a RR0 Lyrae star that
for some reason has evolved a long way beyond the fundamental blue edge without yet
changing mode. The “hysteresis” eﬀect is well-known in globular clusters and it is possible
that stars 175.30921.95 and 125.23192.175 are also extreme examples of it. Stars at the
blue edge of the instability strip should have a larger amplitude (Sandage 1981). Stars
175.30921.95 and 125.23192.175, the blue stars with deviating E(V − R) values, have about
twice as large V amplitudes as the other two blue stars, 129.26623.1139 and 146.28412.88. It
is also possible that the MACHO photometry of the star 175.30921.95 and 125.23192.175 is
incorrect. Follow-up observations would help clarify this point. In conclusion, although rare,
reddening values for RR0 Lyrae stars determined by ﬁnding the (V − R) color at minimum
V -band light can be in error if the star is unusually blue. This can be corrected if the
temperature of the RR0 Lyrae star is known.

4. Conclusions

A quantitative analysis of reddening toward the Galactic Bulge is performed. Assuming
that the extinction aﬀects the V magnitudes more signiﬁcantly than the distance spread and
the intrinsic scatter in absolute magnitudes, we interpret the slope of the stellar locus on the
V versus (V − R) diagram as the selective extinction coeﬃcient, RV,V R = AV /E(V − R).
From the MACHO RR0 Lyrae sample toward the Galactic Bulge, we derive RV,V R = 4.3±0.2.
This corresponds to the average value observed in the solar neighborhood RV,BV = 3.1 ± 0.3,
and indicates that the optical reddening law toward the bulge is consistent with the standard
extinction law. We show that the mean minimum-light (V − R)0 color of an RR0 Lyrae star
is nearly constant at minimum V -band light and equals 0.28 ± 0.02, regardless of metallicity.
Using this property, reddening values to 3525 RR0 Lyrae stars are found. Parameters derived
for individual stars are presented in the electronic version.
