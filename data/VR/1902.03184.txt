ABSTRACT

There has been a long history in electrical muscle stimulation (EMS),
which has been used for medical and interaction purposes. Human-
computer interaction (HCI) researchers are now working on various
applications, including virtual reality (VR), notiﬁcation, and learn-
ing. For the electric signals applied to the human body, various
types of waveforms have been considered and tested. In typical
applications, pulses with short duration are applied, however, many
perspectives are required to be considered. In addition to the dura-
tion and polarity of the pulse/waves, the wave shapes can also be
an essential factor to consider. A problem of conventional EMS
toolkits and systems are that they have a limitation to the variety of
signals that it can produce. For example, some may be limited to
monophonic pulses. Furthermore, they are usually limited to rectan-
gular pulses and a limited range of frequencies, and other waveforms
cannot be produced. These kinds of limitations make us challenging
to consider variations of EMS signals in HCI research and applica-
tions. The purpose of “wavEMS” is to encourage testing of a variety
of waveforms for EMS, which can be manipulated through audio
output. We believe that this can help improve HCI applications, and
to open up new application areas.

1 INTRODUCTION

The use of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) is becoming pop-
ular in human-computer interaction (HCI) and virtual reality (VR)
ﬁelds. While the original technique is rooted in the medical ﬁeld
for rehabilitation purposes, it is now common to explore interactive
applications. Before HCI researchers found their interest for EMS,
some artists used them for embodied performances. In 1995, an
artist Stelarc used electrical stimulation for his performance [30].
Furthermore, Elsenaar [6] and Manabe [21] applied EMS on to their
face for their performances. Following these applications, in 2010,
Tamaki et al. [32] introduced EMS to HCI by presenting ﬁnger ma-
nipulation techniques, which was a pioneering work in the ﬁeld.
Since this work, many researchers are now using EMS for HCI, and
many workshops have been held (e.g., [16]).

While EMS can perform as a strong mean for human augmenta-
tion purposes, researchers may still ﬁnd it difﬁcult to understand the
appropriate waveforms and safety concerns. These kinds of knowl-
edge tend to spread around various research ﬁelds, which makes HCI
researchers difﬁcult to follow them comprehensively [12]. In HCI,
researchers mainly use square waves for the stimulation, however,

*e-mail: mchkono@acm.org
†e-mail: rekimoto@acm.org

using other waveforms may have potential to expand the effect of the
electrical stimulation. Therefore, to further encourage researchers
to explore using various waveforms, we provide literature on the
effect of EMS waveforms and a system that can provide various
waveforms for the stimulation. The system allows to output signals
through audio input, where the audio signals are directly converted
to electrical stimulation. We named this system wavEMS, which is a
wireless mobile EMS toolkit.

The contributions of this paper, are concluded as follows.

• We conclude the history and the effect of waveforms of EMS
from literature in research ﬁelds other than HCI, and to help
researchers consider exploring various waveforms of EMS.

• We propose wavEMS, which is a toolkit for researchers and
practitioners. The system can be controlled via wireless audio
signals, and the waveforms can be designed freely.

2 RESEARCH ON EMS IN HCI
2.1 Application in HCI
There are many EMS research for various applications, including
VR [17, 18], learning [5, 32], and many others. Muscle-plotter [19]
used multiple channels of EMS to guide users to move their hand for
hand output activities. Niijima et al. [24] applied EMS to the face,
in order to control the contraction of the bodily muscles. Pfeiffer
et al. [27] applied EMS on to the user’s leg to control the walking
direction. We can notice that EMS can be applied to various body
parts. This is also an important feature of EMS, where they can be
built in a tiny package with strong output force [15]. Another inter-
esting domain is to use EMS for emotion expression [7, 11]. As well
as Impacto [17], which is a work that used EMS for VR feedback,
the tactile element (tingling) of EMS can disturb the performance of
such applications. We believe that there is a possibility where we
can restrain this negative effect by considering more suitable EMS
waveforms.

2.2 Systems for EMS in HCI
To build applications, researchers have also developed some systems
for EMS. Let your body Move toolkit [26] is a common system
that is used for many following EMS research in HCI. Zap++ [4]
was a system with a maximum of 20 channel output. The system is
designed for a sleeve worn on the arm, where various combinations
of the electrodes are allowed for the stimulation output. multi-
ems [10] was also an opensource toolkit for multiple channel output.
For these systems, the signals of the EMS are controlled by switches,
and generate square waved pulses for output. Manabe et al. used
an EMS board for their workshop [22], which was controlled by
audio output. The board also allows improving the signal variations
of EMS. However, it consists of two large transformers (140 g
each), which can disturb its mobility. Another concern is that where
the system can allow dangerous signal output when used without
appropriate knowledge. Therefore, we provide a user interface for
popular waveforms to restrict dangerous output, and literature for
effective signals. Another beneﬁt of wavEMS is where it can be
small/light and can be controlled via wireless communication.

3 HISTORY AND PARAMETERS OF ELECTRICAL MUSCLE

STIMULATION

The history of EMS is rooted from 1791, when Luigi Galvani used
electric current to cause a muscle of a frog to constract [3]. At this
time the mechanism was still unknown, however, attracted great sci-
entiﬁc interest, and was studied through the 1800s to reveal the prin-
ciples [2]. In 1903, Prof. Leduc introduced a form of electric current
to minimize the energy for muscle contraction [23]. This was where
the pulsed inputs that are still used nowadays, were investigated
and applied for muscle stimulation. For the experiments, an anaes-
thetized cat was used to observe the effect of stimulation [23]. The
terms “Chronaxie” and “Rheobase” was ﬁrst stated in Lapicque’s
paper in 1909 [8]. These terms are used to discuss the relationship
between the strength and duration of a rectangular pulse and it’s
threshold (Figure 1). Later in 1977, “Russian currents” have been
reported by Yakov Kots [34]. Russian currents consist of 2.5 kHz
AC signals that are burst modulated at 50 Hz with a 50 % duty
cycle. Although this seemed to be an effective method for electrical
stimulation, it is now been studied to be inferior to other types of
signals [2]. Since then, various research with various signals has
been conducted and may devices have been created for rehabilitation
and training purposes [14, 31].

When using EMS, considering the type of signal is an impor-
tant element. There are studies that have compared various types
of waveforms [1, 31] (Figure 2). Ara´ujo et al. noted that square
waveforms can be more uncomfortable compared with triangular
and quadratic waveforms [1]. Laufer et al. said that monophasic
and biphasic signals have an advantage over polyphasic waveforms
(2.5 kHz) regarding the generated fatigue [13]. Petrofsky et al. com-
pared sine, square and the Russian waveform, and found that sine
waves were less painful, still having a greater muscle strength [25].
For monophasic and biphasic signals, there are arguments for both
waveforms [6, 28, 33]. For example, biphasic waves can give a
sharper sensation, while they can be beneﬁcal to reduce fatigue.
Prausnitz presented a review for the effect of the current applied to
the skin [29]. For interactive use cases, Knibbe et al. concluded
that various parameters can be explained differently when experi-
enced [9]. Other considerations include the electrode size that also
may inﬂuence the stimulation of EMS [20]. Researchers should
carefully consider the parameters for their purposes.

sine wave of a carrier frequency of 2,500 Hz and burst and inter-burst
duration of 10 ms is called a Russian current.

signals and the converted power source activates a PWM ampliﬁer
(IFJM-001, Marutsuelec Co., Ltd.), which outputs EMS signals to
the electrodes (the maximum voltage is ± 60 V, and the current is
limited to a maximum of 100 mA). For the software, we prepared a
Processing program that can output typical EMS waveforms. How-
ever, for wavEMS, any type of audio can be used for stimulation
output. wavEMS allows to output various waveforms including; sine
waves, triangle waves, square waves, Russian current, and other de-
sired waveforms. Waveforms of EMS can inﬂuence the experience
in many ways. Another important beneﬁt of wavEMS, is where it is
controlled wirelessly. This helps in improving the mobility of EMS
prototyping.

One negative aspect of wavEMS is where it can output signals that
are not usually used for EMS, and can be dangerous without knowl-
edge. Therefore, when using wavEMS, understandings of safety
will be more strictly required. We recommend going through safety
guidelines [12], and to check the considerable threats, especially the
effect of the frequency.

Figure 3: The system overview of wavEMS.

4.2 How to Use

The audio output from the computer can be used for wavEMS. For
prototyping, we provide a user interface which is designed based on
the Minim library1 of Processing2. In this user interface, the user
can choose the output waveform from sine, saw, square waves of
Russian current, as well as the frequency and pulse width (Figure 5).
This allows users to try popular types of outputs, which are consid-
ered safe and effective. The controller of wavEMS is not limited to
Processing, and other tools such as Max/MSP can be used. Further-
more, audios from other resources can be used (e.g., Youtube), and
can be used to feel the sound output of various audio. However, we
must note that using audio signals can sometimes become dangerous.
Therefore, it is strongly recommended to follow safety guides [12],

duration curve for stimuling tissues/nerves.

4.1 Hardware Design
We named our system “wavEMS,” and the system is shown in Fig-
ure 3 and 4.

The implementation consists of a Bluetooth module, piezo ampli-
ﬁer, battery, and voltage converters. RN-52 (Microchip Technology)
allows the toolkit to connect to mobile devices or computers, and
receives the audio signals. A 3.7 V Li-ion battery is used, which is
converted to 12 V and ± 5 V with DC-DC converters. The audio

5 DISCUSSION

When experiencing stimulation from EMS systems, it is common to
use signals around 1–150 Hz and pulse width with 30–800 µs [12].
Signals around this area can be usually effective for muscle actuation
purposes. However, it is known that signals at high-frequencies are
more difﬁcult to be perceived by the human body. Therefore, using
audio signals with high frequencies may not be effective for muscle
stimulating purposes. In addition, risks for heat generation can
become more noticeable in such situation, thus should not be used
for a long duration continuously.

As a limitation of our current system, the system only allows
a single channel output. Furthermore, there are still areas of im-
provements regarding energy efﬁciency. We plan to improve these
elements and to provide the system as an opensource toolkit.

The bus voltage can be controlled by the resistance of the resistor
included in the circuit, and lower bus voltage can improve the reac-
tive power and electromagnetic interference. For our initial testing,
we use a 3.9 kΩ resistor for the ampliﬁer to adjust the bus voltage
(this allows to emit the maximum voltage at ± 60 V). However, this
amplitude may be too strong for many users, and typically, lower
voltage can be enough for HCI purposes. Therefore, this resistor can
be replaced with a large resistance, which can contribute to energy
efﬁciency as well.

For typical square pulsed based EMS systems, galvanic isola-
tion between the power source side and the signal generation side
are applied to improve safety. In our current implementation, the
board is isolated with the signal generator (e.g., computer) by using
Bluetooth communication, however, it still does not have isolation
between the circuits of the signal receiver and the power source.
Therefore, users must keep in mind not to touch the system while it
is active, or otherwise should be covered with insulating materials.

close to the chest).

6 CONCLUSION

4.3 Performance

The prototype of wavEMS was tested by the author. Frequencies
were adjusted between 20–400 Hz and pulse widths were adjusted
between 40–600 µs. The system successfully provided outputs with
the desired parameters, with the desired waveform (both monophasic
and biphasic), and appropriate muscular contraction was observed.
However, due to characteristics of the ﬁlter of the system, the inten-
sity tended to differ depending on the waveform, when the audio
output was set to a ﬁxed level on the computer used for the signal
generation. Currently, the intensity tended to be stronger for square
waves, and lower for triangular waves. Therefore, we set the gain of
through the Minim library for square, sine, and triangular waves at
-2, 2, 6 respectively via software. However, it is still recommended
to adjust these gain parameters more precisely, when comparing the
effect of the waveforms at the same intensity.

Figure 6 shows the output of wavEMS observed through an oscil-
loscope, with a 10 kΩ resistor. We are aware that there are noises
on the waves, however, due to the nature of human perception to
electricity, we believe that high-frequency noises are not perceptual
and have only a minor effect to the EMS experience.

They are sine, triangular, squared and Russian current output respec-
tively.

This paper introduces wavEMS, an audio-based EMS system for pro-
totyping and research explorations. While many HCI researchers use
squared pulsed-waves, there are also potential to use other variations
of waveforms, which may lead to different muscular effects and skin
perception. Therefore, it is important for us to extend the possibility
of the waveforms of EMS for further research development in HCI.
In order to provide such opportunity, we developed wavEMS, which
consists of a Bluetooth module and an ampliﬁer for audio signals. A
user interface was developed, so that researchers can test variations
of typical EMS waveforms with various parameters. Our system
allows improving the signal variation freedom of electrical stimula-
tion. We believe that this paper can help improve HCI applications,
and to open up new application areas.
