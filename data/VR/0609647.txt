1 The aim

The aim of this contribution is to present the two ﬁrst phases of the optical
monitoring programme of the Gravitational Lenses group at the Universidad
de Cantabria (GLUC, http://grupos.unican.es/glendama/). In an initial stage
(2003 March-June), the Estaci´on de Observaci´on de Calar Alto (EOCA) was
used to obtain V R frames of SBS 0909+532 and QSO 0957+561. These obser-
vations in 2003 led to accurate ﬂuxes of the two components of both double
QSOs, which are being compared and complemented with data from other
1-1.5 m telescopes located in the North Hemisphere: Fred Lawrence Whipple
Observatory (USA), Maidanak Observatory (Uzbekistan) and Wise Obser-
vatory (Israel). On the other hand, the GLUC started the second phase of
its monitoring programme in 2005 January. In this second phase, they are
using the 2 m fully robotic Liverpool Telescope (LT). The key idea is the two-
band photometric follow-up of four lensed QSOs with diﬀerent main lensing
galaxies: SBS 0909+532 (elliptical), QSO 0957+561 (giant cD), B1600+434
(edge-on spiral) and QSO 2237+0305 (face-on spiral). Thus, the light rays
associated with the components of the four gravitational mirages cross diﬀer-
ent galaxy environments, and the corresponding light curves could unveil the
content of these environments. While SBS 0909+532 and QSO 0957+561 are
the targets for the two ﬁrst years with the LT (2005-2006), the rest of targets
(B1600+434 and QSO 2237+0305) will be monitored starting from 2007.

The photometry and the analysis of data are conducted by the GLUC
members and collaborators in several non-Spanish institutes, and we focus
on the most relevant measurements, i.e., detection of intrinsic events (caused

by the sources), time delay and ﬂux ratio estimates, quantitative study of the
structure and chromaticity of the intrinsic signals, determination of chromatic
(between two optical ﬁlters) delays, and detection of extrinsic ﬂuctuations
(due to intervening objects in the involved galaxies, e.g., microlenses or dusty
clouds). These measurements are used to tackle three hot astrophysical sub-
jects: current expansion rate of the Universe, structure of the main lensing
galaxies and nature of the sources (QSOs). The discovery of variable ﬁeld
stars or supernova explosions might be a bonus of the programme.

2 SBS 0909+532

SBS 0909+532 consists of two components (double QSO) separated by about
1 arcsec [1, 2, 3, 4]. The lensing elliptical galaxy has a large eﬀective radius
with a correspondingly low surface brightness [3]. In Fig. 1 (top panel) we
show a Maidanak subframe in the R band, where there are two close quasar
components, but the very faint galaxy is not apparent. Although the presence
of a faint galaxy has a positive aspect: simple photometric model with only
two close point-like sources (we can avoid additional complications arising
from the use of a galaxy proﬁle), the faint and extended lenses are not a
good business for cosmological studies. The relative astrometry of the quasar
components (with respect to the centre of the lens galaxy) is not accurate,
and this fact plays a crucial role in the estimation of the Hubble constant or
the surface density of the lens (see below).

During the Phase I monitoring (EOCA/2003), the set of optical frames
cover the period between 2003 March 4 and June 2. Exposures in the V
and R Johnson-Cousins ﬁlters were taken every night when clear. We have
checked (via Wise data) the reliability of the EOCA diﬀerential photometry
between widely separate and neighbouring stars (see the six ﬁeld stars in the
bottom panel of Fig. 1), and we have concluded that only the relative ﬂuxes
for neighbouring objects seem to be reliable. Therefore, as the photometric
ruler (empirical PSF to compare with) is the normalised 2D proﬁle of the ”a”
star and there is clear evidence of variability of the ”c” star, measurements of
the brightness of both quasar components (A and B) are always made with
respect to the brightness of the nearby non-variable star ”b”. The R-band
EOCA light curves are complemented with R-band ﬂuxes from Maidanak
frames, so the global monitoring period and the mean sampling rate (in the
R band) are 4 months (∼ 120 days) and one point each 6 days, respectively.
These are the ﬁrst resolved brightness records of SBS 0909+532 [5].

Our data do not show any evidence for extrinsic ﬂuctuations, and they can
be interpreted as intrinsic signals. Moreover, the direct AB cross-correlation
leads to very accurate 1σ determinations of the time delay (∆τBA = −45 ± 1
days, where the sign ”−” means that the intrinsic signal is observed ﬁrst
in B and later in A) and the ﬂux ratio in the R band. Thus, the EOCA
+ Maidanak light curves rule out a delay close to three months, which has

been favoured in a recent prediction by the COSMOGRAIL collaboration [6].
This longer delay is viable only if a very particular extrinsic variability is
considered. However, the new analysis has one weak point that we want to
comment on here. There is a relatively poor overlap between the A and B
records, when the A light curve is shifted by the best solutions of the time
delay and the ﬂux ratio, so we are trying to get a conﬁrmation of the delay and
the absence of extrinsic signal. The LT is being used for this purpose. On the
other hand, the inaccurate position of the lensing galaxy (see above) does not
permit to accurately measure the cosmic expansion rate (H0) and the mean
surface density of the lens (< κ >) [7, 8]. Using the concordance cosmological
model, the redshifts of the deﬂector and the source, basic astrometry of the
system and the measured delay, our 1σ contraints are H0 = 82 ± 41 km s−1
Mpc−1 (isothermal proﬁle) and 1− < κ > = 0.43 ± 0.21 (H0 = 70 km s−1
Mpc−1) [9]. In order to obtain new accurate astrometry of SBS 0909+532, we
are applying for observation time in Cycle 16 of the Hubble Space Telescope.
The Phase II monitoring (LT/2005-2006) is more ambitious than the pre-
vious one. We take exposures in the g and r Sloan ﬁlters (RATCAM optical
CCD camera), and the robotic procedure is optimised to get frames all nights
when SBS 0909+532 is visible (no occultation) if ideal conditions happen (no
rain, no clouds, no technical problems, no ﬁres...). From 2005 October to 2006
June we achieved a good sampling, so we focus in the preliminary r-band
light curves of this double QSO in that period. In relation to the EOCA +
Maidanak campaign in 2003 (R-band), the new 2005 October-2006 June sea-
son with the LT (r-band) has a better time coverage and resolution. Now we

have a global monitoring period and a mean sampling rate of 8 months (∼
240 days) and one point each 3 days, respectively. In Fig. 2 we use the EOCA
+ Maidanak delay (see above) and a magnitude oﬀset ∆mBA = 0.65 mag to
compare the B ﬂuxes (blue circles) and the shifted ﬂuxes of A (red circles).
There is a reasonable agreement between the two components in Fig. 2, and
these preliminary results encourage us. After to set a ﬁnal selection criterium
and include all the available ﬂuxes, we hope to obtain accurate measurements
(variability, time delay, ﬂux ratio, etc) as well as important astrophysical in-
formation [10].

3 QSO 0957+561

The double quasar QSO 0957+561 was discovered 27 years ago in a radio
survey [11]. At optical wavelengths, the main lens galaxy in the system appears
as a relatively bright source close to the image B. This giant cD galaxy is
part of a cluster of galaxies that also contributes to the lensing [12, 13]. The
angular separation between B image and the centre of the cD galaxy is only
of ∼ 1”, whereas the angular separation between A image and the galaxy is
about ﬁve times larger [14]. In spite of almost 30 years of optical monitoring,
there are several points of view about the origin of the variability in the
QSO components. For example, while some people think that the records
contain both long (∼ years) and short (∼ 100 days) timescale microlensing
(extrinsic) events [15], other people have a very diﬀerent opinion: there are no

clear evidences for microlensing variability [16]. From previous g-band light
curves of the system, it was also inferred the existence of two diﬀerent delays
(associated with 100-day intrinsic events of amplitude ∼ 100 mmag), ∆τBA =
417.0 ± 0.6 days and ∆τBA = 432.0 ± 1.9 days (1σ) [17]. The time delay
diﬀerence (15 ± 2 days) leads to a strong constraint for the separation of the
two ﬂares (in the far QSO) that cause the g-band intrinsic events: δr ≥ 300
pc (concordance cosmology).

Fig. 3. LT light curves of QSO 0957+561A: deconvolution technique (blue/red
points) and PSF ﬁtting method (black points/lines). We use arbitrary zero points
in the gr ﬂux (magnitude) scales.

The V R frames taken in 2003 March-June (Phase I monitoring) are consis-
tent with ﬂat light curves for the B component. However, we detect moderate
events of about 50 mmag (amplitude) in the records of A (lasting 10-30 days).
In order to fully describe these V R ﬂuctuations, we looked for additional V R
images, which were taken in the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO)
and the Wise Observatory. Up to now we have only analysed the EOCA +
FLWO records in the V and R bands. We do not ﬁnd clear evidences in favour
of chromaticity, but a proper interpretation of the events will require more
eﬀort and data (Wise?). Complementary data could help to ﬁll the gaps and
trace the moderate ﬂuctuations with better accuracy [9].

Finally, just one year ago (2005 October-November) the LT catched a
prominent gradient in the g-band brightness of the A component (Phase II
monitoring), so a similar gradient will be very probably seen in the g-band
light curve of B in 2006 December-2007 January (∆τBA ∼ 14 months). A
detailed reduction of frames from two diﬀerent techniques (deconvolution and
PSF ﬁtting) indicates the existence of a prominent ﬂuctuation in the g-band

record of A, which seems to be chromatic, with a smaller ﬂuctuation in the r
band (see Fig. 3). This exciting discovery will probably permit to measure a
new high-quality g-band delay, the structure and chromaticity of the intrinsic
signal, etc.
