Abstract. The time delays between the components of a lensed quasar are basic tools to

analyze the expansion of the Universe and the structure of the main lens galaxy halo. In this

paper, we focus on the variability and time delay of the double system SBS 0909+532A,B

as well as the time behaviour of the ﬁeld stars. We use VR optical observations of SBS

0909+532A,B and the ﬁeld stars in 2003. The frames were taken at Calar Alto, Maidanak

and Wise observatories, and the VR light curves of the ﬁeld stars and quasar components are

derived from aperture and point–spread function ﬁtting methods. We measure the R–band

time delay of the system from the χ2 and dispersion techniques and 1000 synthetic light

curves based on the observed records. One nearby ﬁeld star (SBS 0909+532c) is found to

be variable, and the other two nearby ﬁeld stars are non–variable sources. With respect to

the quasar components, the R–band records seem more reliable and are more densely pop-

ulated than the V–band ones. The observed R–band ﬂuctuations permit a pre–conditioned

measurement of the time delay. From the χ2 minimization, if we assume that the quasar

emission is observed ﬁrst in B and afterwards in A (in agreement with basic observations

of the system and the corresponding predictions), we obtain ∆τBA = − 45 +1

−11 days (95%
conﬁdence interval). The dispersion technique leads to a similar delay range. A by–product

of the analysis is the determination of a totally corrected ﬂux ratio in the R band (corrected

by the time delay and the contamination due to the galaxy light). Our 95% measurement

results from contaminated ﬂuxes at the same time of observation.

1. Introduction

The system SBS 0909+532 was discovered by Stepanyan et al. (1991). Some years later,

a collaboration between the Hamburger Sternwarte and the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for

Astrophysics resolved the system into a pair of quasars (A and B) with a direct R–band ﬂux

ratio (at the same time of observation) ∆m = mB − mA = 0.58 mag and a separation of about 1.′′1

(Kochanek et al. 1997). The direct R–band ﬂux ratio was not consistent with the direct ﬂux ratios

at other wavelengths: ∆m = 0.31 mag in the I band and ∆m = 1.29 mag in the B band. From

observations with the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope, a Spanish collaboration got spectra for

each component of the system. The data showed that the system consists of two quasars with the

same redshift (zs = 1.377) and identical spectral distribution, supporting the gravitational lens in-
terpretation of SBS 0909+532 (Oscoz et al. 1997). Oscoz et al. (1997) detected a Mg  doublet in

absorption at the same redshift (zabs = 0.83) in both components, and they suggested that the ab-

sorption features were associated with the photometrically unidentiﬁed lensing galaxy. Through

a singular isothermal sphere (SIS) lens model, the authors also inferred the ﬁrst constraint on

the time delay between the components: |∆τBA| ≤ 140 days, where ∆τBA is the delay of B with
respect to A and the Hubble constant is assumed to be H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1.

In recent years, Lubin et al. (2000) indicated the possible nature of the main deﬂector (early–

type galaxy) and conﬁrmed its redshift (zd = 0.830). Leh´ar et al. (2000) reported on a program

including Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of SBS 0909+532. They discovered the

main lens galaxy between the components, which has a large eﬀective radius, with a correspond-

ingly low surface brightness. This lens galaxy is closer to the brightest component (A), which

is not in contradiction with SIS–like lens models when the farther and fainter component (B) is

stronger aﬀected by dust extinction (see below). The colors of the lens are consistent with those

of an early–type galaxy at redshift 0.83. Assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model,

Leh´ar et al. predicted a time delay ∆τBA in the range [− 10, − 87] days (H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1).

At a given emission time, the sign ”−” means that the corresponding signal is observed ﬁrst in

B and later in A. The COSMOGRAIL collaboration provided the distribution of predicted time

delays of the system (Saha et al. 2005). In their histogram (Fig. 10 of Saha et al.), there are two

features: the main feature is an asymmetric peak around − 80 days and the secondary one is

another asymmetric peak around − 45 days. Therefore, if the COSMOGRAIL predictions are

right, the time delay is very probably of 2–3 months (component B leading component A), but

we cannot rule out a delay of about one and a half months. On the other hand, the ﬂux ratio

anomaly pointed by Kochanek et al. (1997) was conﬁrmed and accurately studied by Motta et

al. (2002) and Mediavilla et al. (2005), who reported the existence of diﬀerential extinction in

the main lens galaxy. Chartas (2000) and Page et al. (2004) also studied the system in the X–ray

domain.

Time delays are basic tools to discuss the present expansion rate of the Universe and the struc-

ture of the main lens galaxy haloes (e.g., Refsdal 1964; Kochanek, Schneider & Wambsganss

2004), so that variability studies are crucial. While some time delays have been measured

from radio light curves (PKS 1830−211: Lovell et al. 1998; Q0957+561: Haarsma et al. 1999;

B0218+357: Biggs et al. 1999; B1600+434: Koopmans et al. 2000; B1422+231: Patnaik &

Narasimha 2001; B1608+656: Fassnacht et al. 2002) or X–ray variability (e.g., Q2237+0305:

Dai et al. 2003), an important set of delays are based on optical monitoring of gravitation-

ally lensed quasars. Optical frames taken at Apache Point Observatory, Fred Lawrence Whipple

Observatory and Teide Observatory were used to estimate a 14–month delay for the double sys-

tem Q0957+561 (e.g., Pelt et al. 1996; Kundi´c et al. 1997; Serra–Ricart et al. 1999; Ovaldsen et

al. 2003). Although the time delay of this ﬁrst multiple quasar has been conﬁrmed through inde-

pendent observations, the measurement is only 5% accurate, or equivalently, there is an uncer-

tainty of about 20 days (Goicoechea 2002). The Tel–Aviv University (TAU) group have recently

determined the time delay between the two components of HE 1104−1805 (Ofek & Maoz 2003).

The TAU delay of HE 1104−1805 disagrees with the earlier estimation by Gil–Merino, Wisotzki

& Wambsganss (2002), but it is in excellent agreement with the determination by Wyrzykowski

et al. (2003). Schechter et al. (1997) measured two delays for the quadruply imaged quasar PG

1115+080. The Belgian–Nordic collaboration carried out a very intense activity during the past

ﬁve years. They participated in several monitoring projects and measured several time delays at

optical wavelengths: B1600+434 (Burud et al. 2000), HE 2149−2745 (Burud et al. 2002a), RXJ

0911.4+0551 (Hjorth et al. 2002), SBS 1520+530 (Burud et al. 2002b) and FBQ 0951+2635

(Jakobsson et al. 2005). The formal accuracies of these 5 estimations range from 5 to 25% (the

1σ error bars vary from 4 to 24 days). Kochanek et al. (2005) also measured the time delays

between the components of the quadruple quasar HE 0435−1223.

The aim of this paper is to present VR observations of SBS 0909+532 in 2003 conducted

by the University of Cantabria (UC, Spain), the Institute of Astronomy of Kharkov National

University (IAKhNU, Ukraine), the Sternberg Astronomical Institute (SAI, Russia) and the Ulug

Beg Astronomical Institute of Uzbek Academy of Science (UBAI, Uzbekistan). We also present

TAU observations of the ﬁeld stars in 2003, which have been kindly made available to us. This

new optical monitoring campaign was carried out at the Calar Alto Observatory (Spain), the

Maidanak Observatory (Uzbekistan) and the Wise Observatory (Israel), and the frames were

taken with the 1.5 m Spanish telescope, the 1.5 m AZT−22 telescope at Mt. Maidanak and the

Wise Observatory 1 m telescope (Section 2). In Section 3, we describe the methodology to obtain

the ﬂuxes of the quasar components and the ﬁeld stars. The VR light curves are also shown in

Section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the time delay estimation from the light curves of A and B

discuss the feasibility of an accurate determination of the cosmic expansion rate and the surface

density in the main lensing galaxy.

2. Observations

We have three diﬀerent sets of frames for SBS 0909+532. The ﬁrst set of optical frames cover

the period between 2003 March 4 and June 2, and they are part of a UC project to test the

feasibility of quasar monitoring programs through 1−2 m telescopes in Spain (Ull´an 2005). These

observations were made with the 1.52 m Spanish telescope at Calar Alto Observatory (EOCA),

Almeria, Spain (see Ziad et al. 2005 for a site–testing on Calar Alto). The EOCA is equipped

with a Tektronics 1024×1024 CCD detector, which has pixels with a physical size of 24 µm,

giving a 0.4 arcsec pixel−1 angular scale. The gain is 6.55 e−/ADU and the readout noise is 6.384

e−. During this ﬁrst monitoring, exposures in the V and R Johnson–Cousins ﬁlters were taken

every night when clear, what makes a total of 20 observing nights. Bad weather in 2003 March

and April prevented us from achieving a very dense sampling. For each monitoring night we have

frames taken with the best seeing conditions, and then we expand the portion occupied by the

three consecutive frames on each ﬁlter, i.e., three 300 s exposures in the V passband and three

180 s exposures in the R passband. Those were the maximum exposure times to avoid saturation

of selected stars in the ﬁeld. In Figure 1 we show a typical frame. In this typical exposure, half

a dozen bright and non–saturated stars were ﬁtted within the ﬁeld of view (FOV). Following the

notation of Kochanek et al. (1997), the FOV included the gravitationally lensed quasar (”GL”)

and nearby ﬁeld stars ”a” (South), ”b” (North) and ”c” (West). The FOV also included two stars

that were introduced by Nakos et al. (2003) and were labelled as ”s1” and ”s2”. These two stars

are placed relatively far from the gravitational lens system, and they appear close to the North–

West edge of the frame (see Fig. 1). A sixth star (”x”) appears close to the South–West edge of

the typical frame.

The second set of observations include frames in February 2003 as well as during April–May

and October–November 2003. The total number of nights is 18. In this second program the im-

ages were taken with the 1.5 m AZT−22 telescope at Maidanak Observatory (Uzbekistan), with

near diﬀraction–limited optics and careful thermo–stabilization, which allow for high–angular–

resolution imaging. The AZT−22 telescope has a LN–cooled (liquid nitrogen cooled) CCD–

camera, SITe- 005 CCD, manufactured in Copenhagen (Denmark). For this camera, the imaging

area is split into 2000×800 pixels, where the pixel size is 15 µm and the intrinsic angular scale

is 0.26 arcsec pixel−1. The frames were taken in the R Bessel ﬁlter, which corresponds approx-

imately to the R Johnson–Cousins passband. The poor tracking system of this telescope allows

only exposures up to 3 minutes. To obtain suﬃciently high photometric accuracy, we took sev-

eral frames each observation night. With respect to the rectangular FOV of the telescope, the

North/South coverage was 2.5 times smaller than the East/West one, so the ”s1”, ”s2” and ”x”

stars were not included within the FOV. Figure 2 shows a zoomed–in image made from one of

the best frames in terms of seeing. There are two close quasar components, but the very faint

galaxy is not apparent. The observations at Mt. Maidanak are part of IAKhNU, SAI and UBAI

projects to follow up the variability of gravitationally lensed quasars.

For the past six years the TAU group have been monitoring several gravitationally lensed

quasars with the Wise Observatory 1 m telescope. The targets are mainly monitored in the

Johnson–Cousins R–band, and the frames are obtained with a cryogenically cooled Tektronix

1024×1024–pixel back–illuminated CCD. The angular scale is 0.7 arcsec per pixel. This pixel

scale and the median seeing (FWHM) of about 2′′ do not allow resolving most of the lensed

objects, e.g., SBS 0909+532. However, the frames of SBS 0909+532 in 2003 are characterized

by wide FOVs, which incorporate the ”a–c”, ”s1–s2” and ”x” stars. This fact permits to do diﬀer-

ential photometry between several pairs of ﬁeld stars, and thus, to test the reliability of the Calar

Alto and Maidanak records.

The pre–processing of the images included the usual bias subtraction, ﬂat ﬁelding using

sky ﬂats, sky subtraction and cosmic ray removal by using the Image Reduction and Analysis

Facility (IRAF) and Munich Image Data Analysis System (MIDAS) environments. Some de-

tails about the whole observational campaign are included in Table 1 (observatories, telescopes,

frames/night, ﬁlters and observation periods).

3. Photometry and VR light curves

Due to the small angular separation between the two lensed components, about 1.′′1 (Kochanek

et al. 1997), the photometry of SBS 0909+532 is a diﬃcult task. This task is also complicated

by the presence of the main lensing galaxy between the components, which could make the

computation of individual ﬂuxes even harder. In general, aperture photometry does not work,

so we must look for better approaches. An initial issue is to decide about the inclusion or not

inclusion of a photometric model for the lensing galaxy. In principle, when computing the ﬂuxes

of SBS 0909+532 we may use a galaxy model derived from the HST images of the system.

The galaxy model could also be inferred from the best images in terms of seeing. Once the

relevant information on the galaxy is known, we would apply a PSF ﬁtting method to all optical

images, setting the galaxy properties to those derived from the HST or the best–quality images,

and allowing the remaining parameters to vary (e.g., McLeod et al. 1998; Ull´an et al. 2003).

Magain, Courbin & Sohy (1998) also presented an alternative task (deconvolution) that combines

all the frames obtained at diﬀerent epochs to determine the numerical light distribution of the

lensing galaxy as well as the positions of the point–like sources (quasar components), since

these parameters do not vary with time. The ﬂux of the point–like sources are allowed to vary

from image to image, which produces the light curves. However, these and other procedures have

A. Ull´an et al.: Time delay of SBS 0909+532

7

a reasonable limitation: they only work well when the galaxy light has a signiﬁcant contribution

to the crowded regions in the individual frames. For a very faint galaxy in a standard (i.e., not

superb) frame, there is confusion between galaxy signal and noise, so the use of a given galaxy

model could lead to biased ﬂuxes of the components. The biases will depend on the quality of the

image (seeing, signal–to–noise ratio, etc), which must produce artiﬁcial variability superposed

to the real one. On the other hand, the use of a direct PSF ﬁtting method (neglecting the galaxy

brightness) leads to contaminated ﬂuxes of the components. But if the galaxy is very faint, the

contaminations will be small. Moreover, the variation of the quasar ﬂuxes, seeing conditions,

etc, will cause ﬂuctuations in the contaminations, which are expected to be below the typical

contamination levels. For standard frames of a quasar lensed by a very faint extended object, it

is really diﬃcult to choose between both approaches (with and without galaxy).

Most of the Calar Alto and Maidanak individual frames of SBS 0909+532 do not show evi-

dences for a galaxy brightness proﬁle. This fact is due to the faintness of the galaxy, as we corrob-

orate here below. If we consider an hypothetical astronomer that neglects the galaxy brightness

and does direct PSF ﬁtting (without taking into account the galaxy when doing the computation

of the ﬂuxes), it is possible to attain a rough estimation of the maximum contamination from the

galaxy to the closest component A (at 0.′′4 from the centre of the deﬂector). We take into account

the paper about 10 lens systems by Leh´ar et al. (2000), where, in Table 3, we can ﬁnd the best

available photometric and astrometric (HST) data of SBS 0909+532. The authors were able to

trace the galaxy light in the H passband, by measuring its position and brightness. If we use the

colors in the same table, we conclude that mgal ∼ 19 mag and mA ∼ 16 mag in the I band (near–

IR), and mgal > 20.4 mag and mA ∼ 16.7 mag in the V optical band. Therefore, as the R ﬁlter is

placed just between the I ﬁlter and the V one, we may assume that mgal − mA ∼ 3.5 mag in the R

band. The diﬀerence of 3.5 mag is consistent with a ratio of ﬂuxes Fgal/FA of about 1/25. Thus,

in the case of QSO 0957+561 we found a R–band ratio of ﬂuxes Fgal/FA of about 1/2.5 (Ull´an et

al. 2003), and now we have Fgal/FA ∼ 1/25, what explains our unsuccessful eﬀorts when mea-

suring the ﬂux of the lens galaxy in standard frames. As a result of that, in an extreme case (when

direct PSF ﬁtting leads to a magnitude mA+gal instead of mA, i.e., all the galaxy light is included

in the proﬁle of the A component) we ﬁnd a relationship: mA = mA+gal + Fgal/FA, where the true

ﬂux (in magnitudes) mA diﬀers from the contaminated ﬂux through direct PSF ﬁtting (mA+gal) in

a quantity Fgal/FA. This maximum contamination of A would be only of 40 mmag, and the real

contamination of both components will be less than our upper limit. The artiﬁcial ﬂuctuations

(caused by variable contamination) will be even smaller than the typical contamination levels, so

we expect they will not play an important role in analyses of quasar variability (e.g., time delay

estimates).

In order to derive the light curves of the components A and B, we decide to use a direct

PSF ﬁtting method and do not consider the galaxy brightness in the ﬁts. The key idea of this

procedure is to obtain the diﬀerent ﬂuxes we are interested in by using a PSF that comes from

a bright star in the ﬁeld common to all frames. The point–like objects (quasar components and

stars) are modelled by means of the empirical PSF. Hence, we do not use a theoretical PSF (i.e.,

Gaussian distribution, Lorentzian distribution, etc), but the two–dimensional proﬁle of a star in

this ﬁeld (a PSF star). Apart from a PSF star, we also need a reference star to do diﬀerential

photometry and to obtain relative ﬂuxes mA − mre f and mB − mre f . The good behaviour of the

reference star is usually checked by using a control star, so the ﬂuxes mcon − mre f are expected

to agree with a constant level. Nevertheless, since the R–band ﬂux ratio is discussed in Section

5, we also want to obtain a rough estimation of the contaminations from this direct technique.

With this aim, a deconvolution technique (Koptelova et al. 2005) is also applied to a set of frames

with good seeing and signal. The selected frames are ﬁtted to a model including the galaxy, and

thus, we are able to obtain a few clean ﬂuxes of components A and B and compare them with the

corresponding contaminated ﬂuxes (through a direct PSF ﬁtting). The averaged contaminations

are used in Section 5.

”b” as reference object (see Fig. 7). The circles are the ﬂuxes yA and the squares are the ﬂuxes

yB− 0.65 mag.

3.1. Calar Alto frames and light curves

We adopt a model of the system including two point–like sources and a constant background.

The model is ﬁtted to each image by adjusting its 7 free parameters (two–dimensional positions

of A and B, instrumental ﬂuxes of both components and background) to minimize the sum of the

square residuals, as described in McLeod et al. (1998) and Leh´ar et al. (2000). We use windows

of 64×64 pixels. Each empirical PSF is a subframe of 64×64 pixels around the PSF star (the ”a”

star in Fig. 1), while the lens system is analyzed from a subframe of the same size, but centered

on the double quasar. The instrumental ﬂuxes of the ”b”, ”c”, ”s1” and ”s2” stars are also inferred

from 64×64 pixels windows centered on them. We initially focus on the nearby ﬁeld stars, and

take the ”b–c” stars as the control–reference objects. The ”a” object is the brightest star in the

”a–c” triangle, and ”b” and ”c” were spectroscopically identiﬁed by Kochanek et al. (1997) and

from six Wise frames. Filled and open symbols are associated with PSF ﬁtting and aperture,

respectively. First, the non–variable star ”b” (see Fig. 7) is taken as the reference object. The top

box incorporates the behaviour of ya + 2.15 mag (ya = ma − mb): Calar Alto (open squares) and

Wise (open triangles). The second box (under the top box) contains the ﬂuxes yc (yc = mc − mb):

Calar Alto (ﬁlled squares) and Wise (open circles). The third and fourth boxes include the ys1 +

2.38 mag (ys1 = ms1 − mb) and ys2 + 0.29 mag (ys2 = ms2 − mb) records, respectively. In the third

box: Calar Alto (ﬁlled and open triangles) and Wise (open astroids), whereas in the fourth box:

Calar Alto (ﬁlled and open circles) and Wise (open rhombuses). Second, we plot the ms2 − ms1−

0.20 mag records in the bottom box: Calar Alto (ﬁlled and open star symbols) and Wise (open

crosses).

Zickgraf et al. (2003): ”b” is a FG star, whose spectrum includes the G–band and Ca  H–K lines,

and ”c” is a M3 star. The R − I and B − R colors of the brightest component (A) and the ”a” star

are similar, the colors of the faintest component (B) are close to the colors of the ”b” star, and

the ”c” star has colors diﬀerent to those of the components and the ”a–b” stars (see Table 1 of

Kochanek et al. 1997). On the other hand, after checking the PSFs of the three nearby ﬁeld stars

(”a–c”), we do not ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences between them. This suggests that the global shape

of the PSFs around the lens system does not depend on the position and color of the point–like

objects, so the PSF of the ”a” star seems to be a reliable tracer of the PSF associated with any

point–like object in the region of interest.

As a ﬁrst attempt for obtaining light curves we use the ”b” and ”c” stars as the control and

reference objects, respectively. Unfortunately, we ﬁnd clear evidences in favour of variability of

the ”c” star, since the three curves mA − mc, mB − mc and mb − mc have a similar global behaviour.

This fact forces us to rule out the ”c” star as a reference–control object and, thus, to take the

”a” and ”b” nearby ﬁeld stars as the control and reference point–like sources, respectively. In the

next subsection, we analyze the Maidanak–Wise ﬂuxes ma − mb and show that both stars (”a” and

”b”) are non–variable objects. This result permits to assure the good behaviour of ”b”. The Calar

Alto ﬂuxes ma − mb are not included in the analysis, since most Calar Alto data disagree with the

relative ﬂuxes for widely separate stars (see below), so only the relative ﬂuxes for neighbouring

point–like objects are reliable photometric measurements. Fortunately, the comparison between

the quasar components and the ”b” nearby reference star seems to be a feasible approach.

After applying the photometric method to the three individual frames for each ﬁlter and night

(see Table 1), we obtain three diﬀerent measurements of yA = mA − mb and yB = mB − mb in the

V and R passbands for each night. To test the reliability of the instrumental ﬂuxes of A and B,

we analyse the residues in each residual frame. A residual frame is an image after subtracting the

ﬁtted background and point–like objects (PSF ﬁtting method). More properly, we focus on the

residual subframe occupied by the system, and then we estimate the residue–to–signal ratio (R/S )

in each pixel of interest. A R/S value less than 10% is acceptable, so a subframe with at least 90%

of pixels having acceptable residues is considered to be related to reliable photometric solutions.

Thus, we classify the individual ﬁts in two categories: ﬁts leading to < 90% of pixels having

acceptable residues (bad ﬁts, unreliable results) and good ﬁts that are associated with reliable

results (≥ 90% of pixels having acceptable residues). As a complementary test, we study the

relation between the quality of the ﬁts (in terms of post–ﬁt residues) and two relevant parameters

(image quality). The signal–to–noise at the brightest pixel of the lens system, (S /N)max, and the
seeing, FWHM (in ′′), are the two parameters to compare with the ﬁt quality. Some kind of

correlation between good ﬁts and good images is expected. In Figure 3 we draw the (S /N)max–

FWHM plots for frames in the R ﬁlter (top panel) and the V ﬁlter (bottom panel). Circles and

triangles represent good and bad ﬁts, respectively. The plots in Fig. 3 indicate that the good ﬁts

correspond to images with high or moderate (S /N)max (≥ 30). Moreover, at moderate (S /N)max
(∼ 30–50), most of the good ﬁts seem to be associated with a relatively good seeing (< 2 ′′).

To obtain a robust photometry, we ﬁnally discard the frames corresponding to the triangles in

Fig. 3. For each ﬁlter and night, if there are two or three good frames (good ﬁts), then we get

mean values of yA and yB, and compute standard deviation of means as errors. We only consider

relative ﬂuxes with uncertainties ≤ 40 mmag.

Now we plot yA (circles) and yB − 0.45 mag (squares) in Figure 4 (R–band ﬂuxes). If we

concentrate our attention in the period with the best sampling (after day 2755), the A light curve

shows a moderate decline and the B record shows a moderate rise. Indeed it seems that the

”b” star is a good reference object (constant ﬂux), since there is no zero–lag global correlation

between yA and yB. In Figure 5 we show the light curves yA and yB− 0.65 mag in the V passband.

In this case we have a total of 11 points for the A component (circles) and 10 points for the B

component (squares). The V–band and R–band light curves of the A component are consistent

with each other. A ﬁnal moderate decline appears in both curves. The situation is more confused

for the B component. The R–band ﬁnal rise is not clearly reproduced in the V band, and the V–

band ﬁnal measurements could have underestimated formal errors. We note the relative faintness

of B in the V band (∆m ∼ 0.8 mag), and thus, the possibility of systematic uncertainties when

the PSF ﬁtting method is applied at some epochs. The data in both optical ﬁlters are available at

http://grupos.unican.es/glendama/.

After presenting the records of the double quasar, we concentrate on the Calar Alto light

curves of the ﬁeld stars that were previously introduced by Kochanek et al. (1997) and Nakos

et al. (2003), i.e., ya = ma − mb, yc = mc − mb, ys1 = ms1 − mb and ys2 = ms2 − mb. There

are no previous studies on the variability of the nearby ﬁeld stars ”a–c”. On the other hand, the

farther ﬁeld stars (”s1–s2”) were veriﬁed to be non–variable by using 76 Wise frames taken from

1999 December 24 to 2002 March 3 (Nakos et al. 2003). As Nakos et al. (2003) found that

”s1” and ”s2” seem to be useful reference stars, we check the behaviour of ”s1–s2” in 2003.

The PSF of the stars in the surroundings of the double quasar could slightly diﬀer from the PSF

of the ”s1–s2” stars in a relatively far region. Therefore, we must be careful when obtaining

the instrumental ﬂuxes of the farther stars. To detect possible anomalies caused by a mismatch

between the brightness proﬁle of the ”a” star and the PSF of ”s1–s2”, the light curves ys1 and ys2

are derived from both PSF ﬁtting and aperture methods. The records ya, yc, ys1 and ys2 in the R

ﬁlter are depicted in Figure 6. To guide the eyes, we use some oﬀsets and dashed horizontal lines

and put all the relative records of each pair within a box. Filled and open symbols are associated

with PSF ﬁtting and aperture, respectively. The top box includes the ya + 2.15 mag ﬂuxes (open

squares). The second, third and fourth boxes (under the top one) correspond to the yc (ﬁlled

squares), ys1 + 2.38 mag (ﬁlled and open triangles) and ys2 + 0.29 mag (ﬁlled and open circles)

records, respectively. As most of the stars are brighter than the quasar components (A and B)

and they are far from other objects, the typical formal errors in the stellar ﬂuxes are clearly less

than the typical uncertainties in the ﬂuxes of the components (these are usually fainter and are

placed in a crowded region). The stellar error bars in Fig. 6 are often smaller than the sizes of the

associated symbols.

When doing aperture photometry on six R–band Wise frames covering the ﬁrst semester

of 2003, we obtain a ya + 2.15 mag light curve (open triangles in the top box of Fig. 6) that

disagrees with the Calar Alto trend in the overlap period (between days 2710 and 2760). In the

next subsection, we show that the Wise and Maidanak brightnesses are constant and consistent

with each other, so the Calar Alto values of ya are not true ﬂuxes, but anomalous results. On

the contrary, the Wise light curve yc (open circles in the second box of Fig. 6) agrees with the

Calar Alto curve in the overlap period. From the Wise frames we conﬁrm the ﬂux level during

the high–state of ”c”. Unfortunately, the small–amplitude variability of ”c” (rms ﬂuctuation of ∼

8 mmag) cannot be conﬁrmed from the Wise data. The rms ﬂuctuation of the Wise ﬂuxes (∼ 9

mmag) is very similar to the Calar Alto variation, but the formal errors are relatively large (∼ 10

mmag). Moreover, there are no Wise frames in 2003 May (around the day 2780) and, thus, we

cannot check (via Wise data) the reliability of the Calar Alto dip in yc (80–100 mmag). However,

the ﬂux of the ”c” star at day 2793 in the V band conﬁrms the existence of a transition from the

low–state to the high–state, which is ﬁnished at days 2800–2810 (see the last open circle in the

second box of Fig. 6). For the ”s1–s2” stars, which are as far from star ”b” as star ”a” is, we

lines describe the rms ﬂuctuation of the measurements. This rms variation agrees with the typical

uncertainty, so ”a” and ”b” seem to be non–variable sources.

again ﬁnd a disagreement between the Calar Alto trends and the Wise records (open astroids and

rhombuses in the third and fourth boxes of Fig. 6). Although aperture curves are closer to the

Wise behaviours, we cannot fairly reproduce the Wise data. Some probes with the ”x” star (using

yx = mx − mb) also indicate that the Calar Alto and Wise behaviours disagree. It seems that the

diﬀerential photometry between widely separate stars may lead to meaningless results, and only

the relative ﬂuxes for neighbouring objects are reliable. To test this conclusion, apart from the

successful results through the neighbouring stars ”b” and ”c”, we also analyze the diﬀerential

photometry between the pair ”s1–s2” (see Fig. 1). The curves ms2 − ms1− 0.20 mag are depicted

in the bottom box of Fig. 6: Calar Alto (ﬁlled and open star symbols) and Wise (open crosses).

In the overlap period (from day 2710 to day 2760), there is a reasonable agreement between

the results from both observatories, and the Calar Alto measurements seem to be quite reliable.

From the Calar Alto frames, both photometric techniques are consistent with each other, but a

constant ﬂux cannot explain the observations. When we ﬁt the data sets to a constant, our best

solutions are characterized by χ2 ∼ 162 (PSF ﬁtting) and χ2 ∼ 6 (aperture). It is a curious fact

that aperture photometry on only one frame per night leads to relative ﬂuxes in rough agreement

with a constant level. However, more reﬁned measurements (aperture or PSF ﬁtting on several

frames per night) reveal the variability of one (”s1” or ”s2”) or both stars.

3.2. Maidanak frames and global R–bandlight curvesof SBS 0909+532

In the case of the R–band Maidanak observations, in order to derive the relative ﬂuxes of the

components of SBS 0909+532, we also use a direct PSF ﬁtting. For a given frame, after to obtain

a ﬁrst estimate of the free parameters (initial solution), the ﬁt is reﬁned through an iterative

procedure, which works as the CLEAN algorithm (Østensen 1994). The iterative task is done

with each individual image, and the solutions converge after a few cycles. For each night, we take

circles (Calar Alto) are the ﬂuxes yA, whereas the open squares (Maidanak) and ﬁlled squares

(Calar Alto) are the relative ﬂuxes yB− 0.45 mag. The top panel contains the results in the winter–

spring of 2003 and the bottom panel includes the results in the autumn of 2003.

all the available images and obtain the mean values of yA and yB. From the standard deviation of

the means, we also derive the errors in yA and yB. In agreement with the criteria in subsection 3.1,

only ﬂuxes with errors less than or equal to 40 mmag are considered. Apart from the analysis

of the lens system, using aperture photometry, we also measure ya. The relative ﬂuxes ya are

depicted in Figure 7 (open star symbols). The Maidanak measurements in the ﬁrst semester of

2003 and the six Wise data of ya (open triangles; see here above) are tightly distributed around

− 0.842 mag (solid line in Fig. 7). The rms ﬂuctuation of the data is only of ∼ 6 mmag (see the

dashed lines in Fig. 7), which is consistent with the typical error of the measurements. The ya

results in Fig. 7 suggest that both ”a” and ”b” are non–variable objects. Through 2003 (ﬁrst and

second semesters) we do not ﬁnd any evidence in favour of variability of the ”a–b” stars.

Fig. 9. Galaxy reconstruction obtained from selected Maidanak frames. Although the double

quasar has been subtracted here, the positions of the components are labeled with two crosses: A

is on the left and B is on the right, and the separation between both crosses is of 1.′′1−1.′′2. The

galaxy contours cover a region of 10′′ × 10′′.

We show our global R–band light curves of SBS 0909+532 in Figure 8. The open circles

(Maidanak) and ﬁlled circles (Calar Alto) are the measurements of yA, whereas the open squares

(Maidanak) and ﬁlled squares (Calar Alto) are the values of yb− 0.45 mag. We have 31 points for

the A component (circles) and 26 points for the B one (squares). The top panel of Fig. 8 contains

the results in the winter–spring of 2003 and the bottom panel of Fig. 8 includes the results in

the autumn of 2003. For each component we test the existence of a bias between the Calar Alto

and Maidanak ﬂuxes, e.g., βA = yA (Calar Alto) −yA (Maidanak). Very small biases of βA = +

15 mmag and βB = − 30 mmag are found, and these corrections are taken into account to make

the global records in Fig. 8. The biases are derived from the comparison between the Maidanak

ﬂuxes in a thirty day period (from day 2750 to day 2780) and the Calar Alto ﬂuxes at equal or

close dates (see the top panel of Fig. 8).

To roughly estimate the contaminations from the direct PSF ﬁtting technique, we take some

of our best Maidanak images (in terms of seeing conditions, FWHM ∼ 1 ′′) in the R band. A

zoom–in of one of these best frames is shown in Fig. 2. Firstly, we combine the selected frames

and derive a numerical model of the galaxy from a regularizing algorithm. To produce a more sta-

ble reconstruction, the real galaxy proﬁle is assumed to be close to the Sersic proﬁle (Koptelova

et al. 2005). Our deconvolution method diﬀers only slightly from the former deconvolution tech-

niques by Magain, Courbin & Sohy (1998) and Burud et al. (1998). Figure 9 presents the galaxy

reconstruction obtained from the stack of the R–band selected frames. The box in Fig. 9 is 16.′′6

on a side. The positions of the components are labeled with two crosses: A is on the left and B is

on the right. The innermost contours are circular–elliptical rings, whereas the outermost contours

show a less deﬁnite shape. Secondly, the selected frames are ﬁtted to a photometric model that

includes the galaxy brightness. Therefore, we are able to infer clean relative ﬂuxes of A and B

(without contamination by galaxy light) and to compare them with the contaminated ones (from

direct PSF ﬁtting). As result of the comparison, we report typical (averaged) contaminations of

18.8 mmag and 4 mmag for the A and B components, respectively. These very weak contami-

nations are in reasonable agreement with our preliminary considerations in the beginning of this

section, and are taken into account in the measurement of the R–band ﬂux ratio in Section 5.

4. Time delay

To calculate the time delay between both components of SBS 0909+532, we use the R–band

brightness records corresponding to the winter–spring of the year 2003. The R–band records

are more densely populated than the V-band ones. Moreover, the R–band time coverage in the

winter–spring of 2003 (about 120 days) is longer than the time coverage in the autumn of 2003

(about 50 days). Thus we focus on the R–band data from day 2670 to day 2790, i.e., 22 points

in the A component and 19 points in the B component (see the top panel of Figure 8). There

are diﬀerent number of points for component A and component B because we only consider

ﬂuxes with uncertainties below 40 mmag (see Section 3). As the B component is fainter, its

photometric uncertainties are larger and the number of ﬁnal data is smaller. The new light curves

are characterized by a mean sampling rate of one point each six days.

Once we have the data set, a suitable cross–correlation technique is required. Here we mainly

use the χ2 minimization (e.g., Kundi´c et al. 1997) and the minimum dispersion (D2) method

(Pelt et al. 1994, 1996). However, although other techniques are probably less robust than the

χ2 and D2 ones (doing a ﬁrst delay measurement, without a previous empirical determination),

we also tentatively explore the modiﬁed cross–correlation function (MCCF) technique (Beskin

& Oknyanskij 1995; Oknyanskij 1997). The MCCF combines properties of both standard cross–

correlation functions: the CCF by Gaskell & Spark (1986) and the DCF by Edelson & Krolik

(1988). We begin our analysis using the χ2 method, which is based on a comparison between

the light curve yA (or yB) and the time shifted light curve yB (or yA). For a given lag, one can

ﬁnd the magnitude oﬀset that minimizes the χ2 diﬀerence. From a set of lags, it can be derived

a set of minima (of χ2), which permits to make a χ2 spectrum: χ2 vs lag. The best solution of

the delay is the lag corresponding to the minimum of the χ2 spectrum. In general, the shifted

time is of 6 days/point).

A) and the dates tA (or tB) in the bin. In principle, we
concentrate in the interval [− 90, + 90] days, which includes the predicted negative delays (see

B (or t′

Introduction) as well as a wide range of unlikely positive delays (positive delays are inconsistent

with basic observations of the system).

Firstly, the curve yA and the time shifted curve yB are compared with each other (using bins

in the A component). In order to work with a reasonable time–resolution, we use α values less

than or equal to two times the mean sampling time, i.e., α ≤ 12 days. The χ2 value roughly

grows with the size of the bin, and χ2 ∼ 1 for α = 7−9 days. For α = 7−9 days, there are best

solutions ∆τBA = + 46−48 days (χ2 = 0.97−0.98), and we show the corresponding spectra in

Figure 10. We have drawn together the spectra for α = 7 days (dashed line), α = 8 days (solid

line) and α = 9 days (dotted line). Apart from the main minima close to + 50 days, there are

other secondary minima at negative and positive lags. In Fig. 10, two secondary minima seem to

stay signiﬁcant for all the bin sizes: the minima close to − 50 days and the probable edge eﬀects

at + 80−90 days. We also compare the curve yB and the time shifted curve yA, using bins in the
B component. For α = 10 days, we obtain a best solution ∆τBA = − 44 days (χ2 = 1.15). Smaller
and larger bins lead to solutions characterized by χ2 < 0.7 and χ2 ≥ 1.2, respectively. In Figure

11, the solid line represents the spectrum for α = 10 days, while the dashed line represents the

spectrum for α = 9 days and the dotted line traces the spectrum for α = 11 days. Main minima in

the interval − 40−50 days appear in all these cases. Unfortunately, important signals at positive

lags and probable border eﬀects at + 80−90 days are again included in the complex spectra. The

important structures at positive lags in Figs. 10−11 are probably caused by artifacts in the cross–

correlation, so they have no physical origin, but are due to the 10/20–day gaps and the moderate

variability of the components. Therefore, taking α = 10 days (bins in the B component) and a

negative range [− 90, 0] days, we try to determine a pre–conditioned time delay.

In order to derive uncertainties, we follow a simple approach. We make one repetition of the

experiment by adding a random quantity to each original ﬂux in the light curves. The random

quantities are realizations of normal distributions around zero, with standard deviations equal

to the errors of the ﬂuxes. We can make a large number of repetitions, and thus, obtain a large

number of ∆τBA values. The true value will be included in the whole distribution of measured

delays. From the χ2 minimization (bins in B and α = 10 days) and 1000 repetitions, we obtain the

histograms in Figure 12. Regarding the distributions in the top panel (delays) and bottom panel

(ﬂux ratios) of Fig. 12, the main features lead to measurements ∆τBA = − 45 +1

−11 days and ∆mBA =
0.590 ± 0.014 mag (95% conﬁdence intervals). We note that the main delay peak is asymmetric,

al. 1996).

so 55% of the repetitions correspond to − 44−45 days, whereas 40% of the repetitions correspond

to values < − 45 days. The secondary delay peak (around − 20 days) represents about 5% of

the repetitions and is associated with the secondary minima in the negative region of Fig. 11.

Therefore, the distribution in the top panel of Fig. 12 permits a 95% estimation of the time delay

of SBS 0909+532.

In Figure 13 (top panel), the A light curve (circles) shifted by the optimal values of the

time delay and the magnitude oﬀset (time–delay–corrected ﬂux ratio), and the unchanged B

light curve (squares) are plotted. The cross–correlation using bins in the B component (α = 10

days) indicates that the initial variations in the brightness of B reasonably agree with the ﬁnal

ﬂuctuations in the brightness of A. The overlap for a delay of − 80 days (e.g., Saha et al. 2005)

also appears in the bottom panel of Fig. 13. However, this last time delay is clearly rejected by

the observations, since the χ2 value is larger than 10 (χ2 ∼ 18).

To conﬁrm the results from the χ2 minimization, we also use the dispersion spectra introduced

by Pelt et al. (1994, 1996). The basic idea is a combination of yA and yB into one global record

for every lag τ and magnitude oﬀset m0 by taking all the values of yA as they are and shifting

the values of yB − m0 by τ. For each τ one can ﬁnd the m0 value that minimizes a dispersion
estimate D2(τ, m0), so a dispersion spectrum D2(τ) can be made in a direct way. We focus on
the D2
4,2 spectra that are called D2 for simplicity (see Pelt et al. 1996 for details). This technique
incorporates a decorrelation length (δ), where δ plays a role similar to that of α in the χ2 method.

Considering reasonable values of δ (from 7 to 11 days, see here above), we are able to make some

interesting spectra. In Figure 14 we have plotted together the spectra for δ = 7 days (dashed line),

δ = 9 days (solid line) and δ = 11 days (dotted line). Although there are main minima in the

interval − 40−50 days, there are also signiﬁcant signals at positive lags and probable border

eﬀects at + 90 days. In the negative region of Fig. 14, a secondary minimum around − 70 days

appears. Using δ = 9 days and a negative range [− 90, 0] days, we carry out a second pre–

conditioned measurement of the time delay. The uncertainties are deduced from 1000 repetitions

of the experiment (see here above), and the relevant histograms are shown in Figure 15. While

the top panel contains the distribution of delays, the bottom panel traces the distribution of ﬂux

ratios. Through the distributions in Fig. 15, we obtain that ∆τBA = − 48 +7
−6 days and ∆mBA = 0.585
± 0.020 mag (90% conﬁdence interval). These D2 results strengthen the conclusions from the χ2

technique. A marginal measurement (10% conﬁdence interval) of ∆τBA = − 67 +1
= 0.558 +0.007

−2 days and ∆mBA
−0.008 mag is also possible. However, both this possibility and the χ2 result of around −
20 days are probably related to the presence of gaps and the absence of strong variability in the

light curves.

22

A. Ull´an et al.: Time delay of SBS 0909+532

A MCCF technique (Beskin & Oknyanskij 1995; Oknyanskij 1997) is also explored. The

MCCF is a modiﬁcation of the standard cross–correlation functions (CCF and DCF). When this

MCFF is applied to our data in the lag interval [− 60, + 60] days, the maximum correlation

coeﬃcient (0.907) corresponds to a lag of − 45 days. This last result basically agrees with the χ2

and dispersion spectra in Figs. 11 and 14.

5. Conclusions

Nowadays several groups are trying to coordinate the rich but scattered research poten-

tial

in the ﬁeld of gravitationally lensed quasar monitoring. The goals are to rational-

ize the astronomical work and to catalyze big scientiﬁc collaborations so that the astro-

physics community can get a signiﬁcant progress in the understanding of the central engine

in lensed quasars, the structure of the lensing galaxies and the physical properties of the

Universe as a whole. Some examples about that are the Astrophysics Network for Galaxy

LEnsing Studies (ANGLES, http://www.angles.eu.org/),

the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey

(CLASS, http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/∼smyers/class.html) and the COSmological MOnitoring

of GRAvItational Lenses (COSMOGRAIL, http://www.cosmograil.org/). The University of

Cantabria group (Spain), three groups of the former Soviet Union (Institute of Astronomy of

Kharkov National University, Ukraine, Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Russia, and Ulug Beg

Astronomical Institute of Uzbek Academy of Science, Uzbekistan) and the Tel–Aviv University

group (Israel) are also carrying out a series of initiatives to better exploit the recent individual

monitoring campaigns as well as to solidify some future common project. In this paper we present

the ﬁrst collaborative programme on the variability of the double quasar SBS 0909+532A,B. The

VR observations of the system and the ﬁeld stars were made with three modern ground–based

telescopes in the year 2003.

The SBS 0909+532c star (N23210036195 in the GSC2.2 Catalogue) at (α, δ) = (09:12:53.59,

+52:59:39.82) in J2000 coordinates is found to be variable, with two diﬀerent levels of ﬂux.

The VR gap between the low–state and the high–state is of 80–100 mmag, and the low–state

lasts about one month. In the high–state the star also seems to vary, but these small–amplitude

variations are not so signiﬁcant as the gap between states. We want to remark the variability of

this nearby star (”c” star), and to encourage colleagues to follow-up its ﬂuctuations and identify

the kind of variable source. The ”c” star cannot be used as the reference object (diﬀerential

photometry), because it introduces a zero–lag global correlation between the light curves of the

quasar components A and B. However, the ”a–b” nearby stars are non–variable sources, and

we choose the ”b” star as the reference candle. On the other hand, the ”s1” and ”s2” stars are

relatively far objects, which were proposed as good references in a previous analysis (Nakos et

al. 2003). However, the new R–band light curve ms2 − ms1 reveals the variability of one (”s1” or

”s2”) or both stars. This variability could be either a very rare phenomenon or a consequence of

doing more reﬁned measurements (aperture or PSF ﬁtting on several frames per night). We warn

A. Ull´an et al.: Time delay of SBS 0909+532

23

about the possible problems with this pair of stars and think it merits more attention. The point–

spread function (PSF) ﬁtting methods permit to resolve the two components of the quasar and

to derive the VR light curves of each component. These new VR light curves represent the ﬁrst

resolved brightness records of SBS 0909+532. Although the V–band curves are interesting, the

R–band records seem more reliable and are more densely populated. The R–band curves show

a moderate variability through 2003, and the observed ﬂuctuations are promising for diﬀerent

kinds of future studies.

To estimate the time delay between the components of SBS 0909+532, we use an 120–

day piece of the R-band brightness records, and χ2 and dispersion (D2) techniques. The cross–

correlation of the two light curves (A and B) leads to complex χ2 spectra. However, assuming

that the quasar emission is observed ﬁrst in B and afterwards in A, or in other words, ∆τBA < 0
(in agreement with basic observations of the system), 95% measurements ∆τBA = − 45 +1

−11 days
and ∆mBA = 0.590 ± 0.014 mag are inferred from 1000 repetitions of the experiment (synthetic

light curves based on the observed records). From the D2 minimization (Pelt et al. 1996) and

1000 repetitions, we also obtain 90% measurements ∆τBA = − 48 +7
−6 days and ∆mBA = 0.585 ±
0.020 mag. The D2 uncertainties are derived under the already mentioned assumption that ∆τBA

is negative. There is a clear agreement between the results from both techniques, so a delay value

of about one and a half months is strongly favoured. Our light curves rule out a delay close to

three months, which has been claimed in a recent analysis (Saha et al. 2005). When we measure

the time delay of the system, we simultaneously derive the time–delay–corrected ﬂux ratio (at the

same emission time) in the R band. This quantity, ∆mBA = mB(t + ∆τBA) − mA(t), is contaminated

by light of the lens galaxy, and taking into account the weak contaminations of A and B (see the

end of subsection 3.2), the totally corrected R–band ﬂux ratio is 0.575 ± 0.014 mag. We remark

that our ﬁnal R ﬂux ratio is in total agreement with the rough (uncorrected by the time delay and

the contamination by galaxy light) measurement by Kochanek et al. (1997): 0.58 ± 0.01 mag. To

properly determine a ﬂux ratio, one must use clean ﬂuxes at the same emission time, i.e., ﬂuxes at

diﬀerent observation times and without contamination (Goicoechea, Gil–Merino & Ull´an 2005).

Only for particular cases (e.g., faint lens galaxy, short delay and moderate variability), it may be

reasonable to use direct ﬂuxes.

In order to get a reasonably good value of χ2, we do not need to introduce a time dependent

magnitude oﬀset or a complex iterative procedure (e.g., Burud et al. 2000; Hjorth et al. 2002),

i.e., only a delay and a constant oﬀset are ﬁtted. This is a strong point of the analysis. The

agreement between the results from diﬀerent techniques is another strong point. However, the

new measurements have some weak points that we want to comment here. The weakest point

is the relatively poor overlap between the A and B records, when the A light curve is shifted

by the best solutions of the time delay and the magnitude oﬀset (e.g., see the top panel of Fig.

13). Moreover, we carry out pre–conditioned measurements, since a negative interval [− 90, 0]

days is considered in the estimation of uncertainties (component B leading component A). This

second weak point is related to the presence of 10/20–day gaps and the moderate variability of

24

A. Ull´an et al.: Time delay of SBS 0909+532

the components, which does not permit to fairly rule out positive delays. We nevertheless remark

that the negative interval is in good agreement with the predictions by Leh´ar et al. (2000) and

Saha et al. (2005), and we ﬁnd χ2 and D2 minima around − 45 days when the observed data and

both negative and positive lags are taken into account (see Figs. 11 and 14). Of course, as any

another ﬁrst determination of a time delay, the 1.5–month value should be conﬁrmed from future

studies.

Forty years ago, Refsdal (1964) suggested the possibility of determining the current expan-

sion rate of the Universe (Hubble constant) and the masses of the galaxies from the time delays

associated with extragalactic gravitational mirages. More recently, for a singular isothermal el-

lipsoid (SIE), Koopmans, de Bruyn & Jackson (1998) found that the time delay can be cast in a

very simple form, depending on basic cosmological parameters, redshifts and image positions.

The relevant image positions are the positions with respect to the centre of the main lens galaxy,

and the SIE delay is similar to the delay for a singular isothermal sphere (SIS). In principle, a

singular density distribution is justiﬁed because a small core radius changes the time delay negli-

gibly, and only a small core radius seems to be consistent with the absence of a faint central image

(e.g., Kochanek 1996). Moreover, individual lenses and lens statistics are usually consistent with

isothermal models (e.g., Witt, Mao & Keeton 2000 and references therein), so it is common to

adopt an isothermal proﬁle. Witt, Mao & Keeton (2000) showed that an external shear changes

the simple SIS time delay in proportion to the shear strength. For two–image lenses that have a

small shear and images at diﬀerent distances from the centre of the lens, the shear should have

a small eﬀect on the time delay. Thus, when one has accurate measurements of image positions,

redshifts and time delay, it is viable an accurate estimation of H0 (using complementary infor-

mation on the matter/energy content of the Universe).

Very recently, Kochanek (2002) also presented a new elegant approach to the subject. He

modelled the surface density locally as a circular power law, with a mean surface density < κ >

in the annulus between the images. Expanding the time delay as a series in the ratio of the

thickness of the annulus to its average radius, it is derived a delay that is proportional to the SIS

time delay. The zero–order expansion term consists of the SIS delay and a multiplicative factor

2(1− < κ >). Kochanek also incorporated the quadrupoles of an internal shear (ellipsoid) and an

external shear. However, for two-image lenses where the images lie on opposite sides of the lens,

the delay depends little on the quadrupoles. This novel perspective is useful to infer < κ > from

observations of the lens system (time delay, image positions and redshifts) and complementary

cosmological data (expansion and matter/energy content of the Universe).

For SBS 0909+532, although the redshifts are very accurately known and the time delay is

now tightly constrained (or at least there is a ﬁrst accurate estimation to be independently con-

the cosmic expansion rate and the surface density of the main deﬂector. We have H0 ∝ θ2
and 1− < κ >∝ (θ2

ﬁrmed), the inaccurate position of the main lens galaxy does not permit an accurate measurement
B − θ2
A
A)−1, where θA and θB are the image angular positions with respect to the
centre of the main lens galaxy. On the other hand, using the astrometry in Table 3 of Leh´ar et al.

B − θ2

A. Ull´an et al.: Time delay of SBS 0909+532

25

(2000), it is easy to obtain θ2

B − θ2

A = 0.4 ± 0.2. Thus we conclude that the accuracy in θ2

B − θ2

A is

only 50%, indicating the necessity of new accurate astrometry of SBS 0909+532.
