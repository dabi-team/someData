Abstract Based on high-resolution spectra we revealed variability of the optical spectrum of the cool
star identiﬁed with the IR source IRAS 20508+2011. Over the ﬁve years of our observations, the radial
velocity derived from photospheric absorption lines varied in the interval Vr = 15 − 30 km/s. In the
same time, the Hα proﬁle varied from an intense bell-shaped emission line with a small absorption to
2-peaked emission with a central absorption feature below the continuum level. At al but one epoch,
the positions of the metallic photospheric lines were systematically shifted relative to the Hα emission:
∆Vr = V r(met)−Vr(H, emis) ≈ −23 km/s. The Na D doublet lines shown a complex proﬁle with broad
(half-width ≈ 120 km/s) emission and photospheric absorption, as well as an interstellar component.
We used model atmospheres to determine the physical parameters and chemical composition of the
star’s atmosphere: Tef f =4800 K, log g=1.5, ξt=4.0 km/s and metallicity [Fe/H]=-0.36. We detected
overabundances of oxygen [O/Fe] =+1.79 (with the ratio [C/O]≈-0.9), and α-process elements, as well
as a deﬁcit of heavy metals. The totality of the parameters suggests that the optical component of
IRAS 20508+2011 is an “O-rich” AGB star with luminosity Mv ≈ −3m that is close to its evolution
transition to the post-AGB stage.

1. Introduction

Our program of spectroscopic observations of evolved stars identiﬁed with IR sources is being carried out with
the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Its basic goal
is to determine the main parameters and evolutionary stages of the stars, search for evolutionary variations
of their chemical compositions, study in detail the velocity ﬁelds in their atmospheres and envelopes, and
detect spectral variability and binarity. The objects under consideration are basically intermediate-mass stars
in the asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) and postAGB stages, which have evolved through stages of hydrogen
and helium burning both in the core and layer sources, mixing and ejection of matter, and mass loss via the
stellar wind on the AGB. There are strong grounds to expect variable elemental abundances in atmospheres
of these evolved objects. Stars in the transition from the AGB to planetary nebulae are conventionally called
protoplanetary nebulae (PPN). The main results of the program are brieﬂy summarized by Klochkova et
al. [1]. The papers [2], which is the ﬁrst in our series of works on the spectroscopy of bipolar nebulae, and
[3], which presents the ﬁrst detailed spectroscopic results for the post-AGB object IRAS 01005+7910 are
also important. The peculiar spectral variability of this object is apparently due to inhomogeneity of its
circumstellar gas-dust envelope. We present here the results of our ﬁrst spectral observations of the optical
component of the IR source IRAS 20508+2011 (hereafter IRAS 20508). The source is beyond the Galactic
plane (b = −15.o3, l = 66.o0), possibly indicating that it does not belong to the young disk population. The
IRAS catalog [4] presents the IR ﬂuxes for the source f12=0.71, f25=1.10, f60=0.48, and f100=1.00.

Unfortunately, neither multicolor photometric nor spectral data at optical wavelengths that could be used
to derive the parameters of the object and reveal its evolutionary status are available. Using the interactive
ALADIN atlas from the Strasburg CDS database, we identiﬁed the optical component of IRAS 20508 as the
star No. 815697 from the compiled catalog [5], with B = 12.m868 and V = 11.m938 (color index B−V = 0.m93).
The star is also present in the catalog GSC HST [6]: No. 0165500558 (mph = 11.m6). Detection of strong Hα
emission in the ﬁrst spectrum of the star obtained with the 6-m telescope in summer 1999 led us to continue

the observations. In Sect. ˙2, we give a brief description our observations and the processing of the spectral
data. Sect. 3 describes the features we found in the spectra of the optical component of IRAS 20508, as well
as our determination of its chemical composition and the radial velocities in the stellar atmosphere and the
circumstellar material.

2. Observations and data reduction

We carried out spectroscopic observations of IRAS 20508 with the 6 m telescope of the SAO. Three spectra
were obtained at the prime focus with the PFES echelle spectrograph [7], which provides a spectral resolution
of R≈17000 in combination with a 1160×1040 CCD. The two latest spectra were obtained with the NES
echelle spectrograph [8] at the Nasmyth focus, using a 2048×2048 CCD. The NES spectrograph equipped
with an image slicer [9] provides a spectral resolution R=60000. Table 1 presents the moments of observations
and the wavelength region of the spectra. The data were extracted from the two-dimensional echelle spectra
using the ECHELLE procedure in the MIDAS package. Cosmic-ray traces were removed via median averaging
of two spectra obtained consecutively. The wavelengths were calibrated using spectra from a Th-Ar hollow-
cathode lamp. The further processing, including photometric and position measurements, was carried out
with the DECH20 code [10], which enables the determination of positions for individual spectral features
by bringing into coincidence the direct and mirror images of their proﬁles. To increase the accuracy of our
radial-velocity measurements, we selected unblended lines for comparisons between observed and synthetic
spectra. For each spectrogram, the positional zero point was determined in the standard way, by calibrating
based on the positions of ionosphere night sky emission and telluric absorption lines observed against the
background of the object’s spectrum. The accuracy of the velocity measured from a single line in a spectrum
obtained with the PFES spectrograph is about 3.0 km/s; the NES spectrograph provifed to measure such
single-line velocities with an accuracy of about 1 km/s.

3. Discussion

3.1. Radial velocity pattern of IRAS 20508

In whole the optical spectrum of IRAS 20508 is typical of a late-type supergiant. Fig. 1 compares a part of
the observed spectrum with the theoretical spectrum calculated in the LTE–approximation with the model
parameters Tef f =4800 K, log g=1.5, and ξt=4.0 km/s (the method and accuracy of the model parameters
are discussed below, in Subsect. 3.2). No signs of the molecular bands that are often observed in the optical
spectra of PPN (see, for example, [1, 11, 12]) are visible in the spectrum of IRAS 20508. The entire set
of radial velocities derived from individual lines did not reveal any wavelength dependence of the velocity.
Table 2 presents the measurements of the radial velocity Vr for all dates. This table indicates essential time
variability of Vr averaged over the lines of metals. At the epoch of our observations, the amplitude of the
Vr variations measured from metallic absorption lines is about 15 km/s: Vr=15.5–29.9 km/s. Within the
uncertainties, the positions of the absorption cores of the Hβ and Hγ lines whose proﬁles are not distorted
by emission are consistent with the velocity derived from the metallic lines. It follows from Table 2 that
the velocity corresponding to the Hα emission wings is variable, which may indicate the presence of some
disturbing component in the IRAS 20508 system. Further observations are needed to conﬁrm the binarity of
the star.

3.1.1. The Hα proﬁle variability.

The main feature in the optical spectrum of IRAS 20508 is the intense Hα emission (Fig. 2). Since the H
proﬁles in both spectra obtained in 2000 are very similar, only one proﬁle is plotted in Fig. 2 for this year.
Hα emission is common for stars evolving close to the AGB stage and, along with an IR excess, provides
the main criterion for PPN candidates [13]. In the spectra of typical PPN, the Hα line displays complex
(emission + absorption) variable proﬁles with core asymmetry, P Cygni or inverse P Cygni proﬁles, or proﬁles
with asymmetrical emission wings (see, for example, [14, 15]). Such features are also frequently observed in
combinations with each other. Hα emission is known as a sign of matter outﬂow and/or pulsations. In the
case of PPN, as a rule, the shift of the core is smaller than that corresponding to the escape velocity; i.e., it
indicates outﬂow (expansion) of the upper layers of the extended atmosphere rather than a wind.

Along with the features common for the spectra of stars close to the AGB stage, the Hα proﬁle in the
spectrum of IRAS 20508 displays its own individual peculiarities, ﬁrst and foremost extended wings (Fig. 2),

Klochkova et al.: Spectroscopy of IRAS20508+2011

3

which are uncommon for such a cool supergiant. The Hα emission is superimposed with variable absorption,
which is systematically shifted by Vr=Vr(H, abs)-Vr(met) ≈ 10 km/s towards longer wavelengths relative
to the photospheric lines (only on the last date of our observations does the position of the H absorption
correspond to that of the metallic lines). For all ﬁve observing epochs, the intensity of the short-wavelength
emission exceeds that of the long-wavelength emission. Over ﬁve years of observations, the Hα proﬁle in the
spectrum of IRAS 20508 varied from an intense, bell-shaped emission feature with only a small amount of
core absorption to a two-peak emission line.

It also follows from a comparison of the H proﬁles in Fig. 2 that the intensity of the emission systematically
decreased during 1999–2003; the central absorption line is below the continuum level in the 2003 spectrum.
The width of the emission wings of the line also varied. At our ﬁrst four epochs, when the emission ﬂux
decreased systematically relative to the continuum radiation, an essentially constant diﬀerence between the
radial velocities derived from photospheric absorption lines and the center of gravity of the H emission proﬁle
was observed: Vr = Vr(met) − Vr(H, emis) ≈ −23 km/s. However, the Vr(met) and Vr(H, emis) velocities
became virtually equal in the last spectrum obtained in 2004; the Hα emission intensity again increased, and
the central absorption again exceeded the continuum. Unfortunately, due to the absence of radiospectroscopic
observations of IRAS 20508, we cannot determine the systemic velocity of the source or suggest even a
preliminary model for the system. Variable Hα emission is also a well-known phenomenon for AGB and post-
AGB stars [16] (see also references in the present study). Diﬀerences in the Hα proﬁles are due to diﬀerences in
the dynamical processes occurring in the extended atmospheres of these stars, such as spherically symmetrical
outﬂows with a velocity that is either constant or variable with height in the atmosphere, matter falling onto
the photosphere, or pulsations. H-proﬁle variability can be naturally explained for a post-AGB star with
signs of binarity and mass loss: the Hα proﬁle varies due to the orbital motion in the system. However,
the Hα proﬁles also vary in those post-AGB objects for which no signs of Vr and brightness variability
are detected. The brightness variability may suggest a shock mechanism, like RV Tauri stars, where the
dissipation of shocks in the atmosphere probably stimulates matter outﬂow. The radiative ﬂuxes from AGB
and post-AGB stars are insuﬃcient for the radiative wind-generation mechanism, which is eﬃcient in the
case of hot massive supergiants. The observed H proﬁle can be considered a combination of two lines with
diﬀerent natures: photospheric absorption and intense emission with a broad set of velocities, forming in
a circumstellar structure. In this case, the emission component can be distinguished by subtracting the
theoretical photospheric proﬁle from the observed proﬁle. If we subtract the photospheric proﬁle calculated
from a model with the solar H/He ratio (indicated in Fig. 3 by the dotted curve), the wings of the resulting
emission proﬁle extend to radial velocities of ±250 km/s.

3.1.2. Structure of the Na D proﬁle.

A detailed study of high-resolution spectra of IRAS 20508 revealed that the Na D resonance doublet also
displays a complex proﬁle, with both absorption and emission components. In the spectra obtained with
the PFES spectrograph, both the Na D1 and Na D2 lines are unresolved asymmetric blends. Let us consider
the spectrum s40402 obtained with high spectral resolution R ≈ 60000 with the NES spectrograph. Fig. 4
presents the observed spectrum in the area of the Na D doublet, along with the theoretical spectrum and
their diﬀerence. A comparison of the observed and synthetic spectra shows narrow absorption (indicated by
1 in Fig. 4) and broad emission (indicated by “2” in the diﬀerence spectrum in Fig. 4) in the Na D doublet.
The position of the emission peak in the Na D doublet lines is roughly consistent with the radial velocity
estimated from the absorption lines of metals. The half-width of the narrow absorption feature is a factor of
1.5 smaller than the average half-width of the absorption lines in the spectrum, suggesting that the narrow
absorption feature is formed in the interstellar medium. It follows from Table 2 that the velocity of the
narrow interstellar component is Vr=−7.7 km/s (relative to the Local Standard of Rest, Vlsr=9.3 km/s).
According to [17], interstellar Na D2 lines at positions corresponding to velocities Vr ≈ −8 . . . −20 km/s
are observed in the Galaxy, in the direction towards the constellation Vulpecula, close to IRAS 20508. Note
that, according to [18], the radial velocities of HII regions in the local volume of the Galaxy in the direction
towards IRAS 20508 are Vlsr,HII 10 km/s, which is close to our obtained value. Brand and Blitz [19] presented
the velocity Vlsr, HII ≈ 21 km/s (Vr ≈ 5 km/s) in this same direction, but for a more distant region of the
Galaxy with d=3.9 kpc. The presence of a corresponding feature in the spectrum of IRAS 20508 cannot be
excluded, in which case, this indicates a larger distance to IRAS 20508, as is also conﬁrmed by the estimated
luminosity of the object (see Subsect. 3.2).

The presence of broad (half-widths reaching Vr ≈ 120 km/s) emission components in the Na D lines
suggests that IRAS 20508 belongs to a relatively small group of supergiants with this type of anomaly

4

in their spectra. Intense and broad (up to 300 km/s) emission in resonance lines, in particular Na D, is
observed in the spectrum of R CrB [20] close to its minimum brightness, as well as in the spectrum of FG Sge
[21, 22, 23], which is manifests itself as a R CrB-type nova, as was shown by Gonzalez et al. [21]. The same
spectral peculiarity is also observed for a number of post-AGB stars, for example, 89 Her [23], QY Sge [23],
and V510 Pup [12]. In the case of the hotter photosphere of QY Sge, the emission is very strong, far exceeding
the continuum level [23]. Rao Kameswara et al. [23] suggest that the resonance-line emission is formed in
hot circumstellar envelopes, while the large width results from photon scattering on moving dust particles of
the envelope. The Na D emission in the spectrum of IRAS 20508 is distorted by intense absorption forming
in the photosphere of the cool supergiant. It is likely that the spectrum of IRAS 20508 displays absorption
identiﬁed with diﬀuse interstellar bands (DIB). However, due to the late spectral type of the star, even the
strong 5780 ˚A band is blended by photospheric lines, complicating distinguishing this band and measuring
its parameters. For the same reason, the radial velocity is diﬃcult to measure, even for the usually easily
discriminated 6613 ˚A band. In particular, it is blended by the YII line in the spectrum of the cool supergiant.

3.2. Main Parameters of the Star

To determine the basic parameters of the model atmosphere of the star–the eﬀective temperature Teﬀ and
gravitational acceleration log g–and calculate the chemical composition and synthetic spectra, we used the
grid of model stellar atmospheres calculated by Kurucz [24] in a hydrostatic approximation for various metal-
licities. The eﬀective temperature was determined in the usual way, from the condition that the abundance
of neutral iron be independent of the excitation potentials for the lines used. The gravitatonal acceleration
was selected based on the condition of ionization balance for the iron atoms, and the microturbulent ve-
locity from the condition that the iron abundance be independent of the line intensities. A supplementary
criterion for the reliability of the method is that the same dependence as that for Fe not be derived for
other elements represented by numerous lines in the spectra (e.g., SiI, CaI, TiI, CrI, NiI). In addition, if the
microturbulent velocity has been determined with high reliability, there should be no dependence between
the individual abundances and equivalent widths of the lines used for the calculation. The abundances of
titanium and vanadium derived from lines of neutral atoms and ions are consistent within the uncertainties.
This provides evidence that the gravitational acceleration in the atmosphere has been correctly estimated
based on the condition that the iron atoms be in ionization balance. Overall, the internal consistency of
the parameters suggests that the homogeneous model atmospheres used are adequate for calculations of
weak lines in the approximation of LTE. Table 3 presents the elemental abundances (X) for individual lines.
Table 4 contains the resulting parameters of the model atmosphere Tef f , log g, and ξt together with the
average elemental abundances relative to iron [X/Fe]. The abundances of elements in the solar photosphere
are taken from [25]. The oscillator strengths of spectral lines involved in determination of the model pa-
rameters and elemental abundances are given in [26, 27]. The average typical uncertainties in the model
parameters for a star with an eﬀective temperature near 5000 K are Tef f ≈ 100 K, log g ≈ 0.3 dex, and
ξt ≈ 0.5 km/s. The dispersion of the elemental abundances derived from a set of lines is small: the rms
deviation usually does not exceed 0.3 dex (Table 4). All our calculations were carried out using the WIDTH9
code assuming LTE-approach. Corrections for superﬁne structure and isotopic shifts, which broaden the NiI,
MnI, and BaII lines, were not taken into account. To verify the reliability of the derived parameters of the
model atmosphere, we compared the observed spectrum with the synthetic spectrum calculated using the
STARSP code [28]. The observed and theoretical spectra (see example in Fig. 1) are reasonably consistent.
When determining the model-atmosphere parameters, we used lines with low and moderate intensity with
equivalent widths W ≤ 0.25 ˚A, since the approximation of a stationary plane-parallel atmosphere may be
inadequate to describe the strongest spectral features. In addition, some strong absorption features may be
distorted by the inﬂuence of the circumstellar envelope, and if the spectral resolution is not suﬃciently high,
the intensity of the envelope components will be included in the observed intensities of components formed
in the atmosphere. The eﬀective temperature of the central star Tef f =4800 K indicates that IRAS 20508 is
in the transition from the AGB towards the PPN stage [29]. The value log g=1.5 testiﬁes that the luminosity
of the star is not very high. We estimated the absolute magnitude Mv from the equivalent width of the
OI 7773 ˚A oxygen IR triplet, W =0.57 ˚A. It is known that the equivalent width of this triplet W(OI) may
represent a good indication of the absolute luminosities of supergiants over a broad interval of tempera-
tures. Using the calibration of Ferro et al. [30], we obtain Mv ≈ −3m. Applying the calibration relations of
Straizys and Kuriliene [31], we can translate Tef f =4800 K and Mv ≈ −3m into the star’s spectral class and
luminosity type: G5 I–II, which corresponds to the normal color index (B − V )o ≈ 0.95, which is consistent
with the observed value B − V =0.93. We thus conclude that no color excess is observed for the high-latitude

Klochkova et al.: Spectroscopy of IRAS20508+2011

object IRAS 20508. This makes it possible to estimate the distance to the star from its absolute luminosity:
d = V − Mv ≈ 10 kpc. Note here that, according to Neckel and Klare [32], the interstellar absorption in the
disk of the Galaxy towards an object with longitude l = 66o is substantial: even at distances up to 1 kpc,
the absorption increases to Av ≥ 3m. The absence of any substantial absorption at optical and even UV
wavelengths, despite the large amount of dust around the star, is one of the mysteries of PPN. In this sense,
the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the supergiant HD 161796=IRAS 17436+5003, which displays a
strong IR excess [33] and no distortions of the SED at optical and UV wavelengths [34, 35] is considered to
be typical. In general, the absence of any substantial absorption at UV wavelengths can be understood if the
dust envelope is spatially separated from the central star; thus, the envelope does not substantially aﬀect the
radiation of the star. The large distance to IRAS 20508 and the absence of reddening with a large IR excess
leads us to con sider another aspect of the structure of supergiants with IR excesses and their distances.
Menzies and Whitelock [36] noted a paradoxical diﬀerence between the distances to the G0I star QY Sge (the
optical component of IRAS 20056+1834) obtained using diﬀerent techniques. Menzies and Whitelock [36]
obtained the distance d ≈ 500 pc for QY Sge based on its interstellar absorption, while taking the absolute
magnitude for a population I G0I supergiant to be Mv = −6.m5 yields a distance to QY Sge of d≈36 kpc
(for a low-mass population II supergiant in the post–AGB stage, d ≈ 9 kpc). To explain this substantial
diﬀerence, Menzies and Whitelock [36] suggested a model with an extremely inhomogeneous circumstellar
envelope heated by the star. QY Sge is considered to be a nearby system (d ≈ 500 pc), in which the direct
radiation from the star towards the observer is obscured by the dust envelope, while the observed ﬂux is
determined by scattering on matter ejected by the star earlier and located behind it. In such an aspherical
system, the observed ﬂux essentially does not depend on the temperature and luminosity of the star; in-
stead, it is speciﬁed by the morphological parameters of the system–the distance between the envelope and
central star, the angle between the system’s axis and the line of sight, the angle of the cone in which the
star’s radiation emerges, and the optical depth and parameters of the dust particles of the envelope. Similar
models were suggested previously for several objects, such as the supergiant VY CMa [37] and the AGB star
CIT 3, which is identiﬁed with the IR source IRC+1011 [38].

3.3. Chemical abundances pattern

Table 3 presents the measured equivalent widths W for individual lines in one of the spectra (s25309), along
with the calculated abundances (X) for the entire set of lines used to determine the chemical composition.
We selected this spectrum (s25309) to calculate the chemical composition because it has the highest signal-
to-noise ratio (as can be seen in Fig. 1) and a large interval of detected wavelengths. Table 4 presents the
averaged abundances for 27 elements. Below, we will analyze in detail the abundances of elements belonging
to various groups; ﬁrst, however, we will consider the separation of elements in the atmosphere of an object
with a gas–dust envelope. Separation of elements in the envelope. The studied object may be undergoing a
stage of lowintensity mass exchange between the atmosphere and circumstellar gasdust envelope. However,
the very fact that the iron abundance is close to the solar value indicates that condensation on dust particles
does not cause any serious distortions in the elemental abundances, since iron is among those elements
that most eﬃciently condense onto particles [39]. The CNO-group elements sulfur and zinc are essentially
unaﬀected by fractioning processes. Since the abundances of CNO elements may vary due to nuclear reactions
in the course of the star’s evolution, the behavior of zinc and sulphur is critical for the eﬃciency of selective
separation. The abundance of zinc does not vary in the course of stellar nucleosynthesis in the interiors of low-
and medium-mass stars. In combination with the ratio [Zn/F e] = −0.24, which is not appreciably diﬀerent
from its solar value, this suggests that we do not see any selective separation in the circumstellar envelope
of IRAS 20508. The abundance of sulfur in the atmosphere of IRAS 20508 is very high: [S/F e] = +0.74. A
similar substantial sulfur excess was detected, for example, in the stars HD 331319 = IRAS 19475+3119 and
HD 161796 = IRAS 17436+5003 [40], as well as the optical component of the IR source IRAS 04296+3429
[41]. A similar result for sulfur was also obtained for the two evolved stars K 413 [42] and K 307 (a W Vir-
type V 1 variable) [43], which are members of the globular cluster M 12. Bond and Luck [44] revealed a very
large sulfur excess ([S/F e] = +1.2) in the atmosphere of the lowmetallicity post-AGB star HD 46703, and
suggested that sulfur was synthesized via the capture of particles by 12C nuclei. However, Klochkova [45]
also detected an excessive abundance of sulfur in the atmosphere of the normal massive supergiant α Per,
which does not have a circumstellar envelope, so that no condensation should be present, while we do not
expect the synthesis of sulfur at such an early evolutionary stage. There are grounds to conclude that the
sulfur excess is a stable peculiarity in the chemical compositions of evolved stars. Note that this excess
is observed in stars with diﬀerent metallicities and temperatures. Light elements. Let us now consider the

6

Klochkova et al.: Spectroscopy of IRAS20508+2011

abundances of light metals. No LiI 6707 ˚A line is seen in the spectrum of IRAS 20508. The abundances of
CNO-group elements in its atmosphere are substantially diﬀerent from the solar values, though these results
have only low accuracy. The excess abundance of carbon [C/F e] + 0.9 is determined from four weak CI lines
with equivalent widths W > 10 m˚A. In the case of nitrogen, only the NI 7468 ˚A line was measured, since
the NI 7423 ˚A line is blended with the SiI line and NI 7442 ˚A line is beyond the limits of our echelle frame.
Therefore, the derived excess of nitrogen should not be considered ﬁrm. We calculated the oxygen abundance
([O/Fe] = +1.79) using reliably measured lines of the OI 7773 ˚A oxygen IR triplet. However, it is known that
the lines of the 7773 ˚A triplet are sensitive to deviations from LTE. The 7773 ˚A lines in the spectrum of
IRAS 20508 are not very strong, and their total equivalent width is W = 0.56 ˚A. Taking into account the
calculations of Gratton et al. [46], we can neglect systematic errors in the oxygen abundance derived from
the triplet lines assuming LTE for such a cool star, and consider the derived excess to be real. As a result,
we obtain [C/O] = −0.9 which indicates that IRAS 20508 is a member of the group of evolved objects with
oxygenenriched atmospheres. This result is consistent with the position of the object in the V I b region in
the van der Veen–Habing diagram [47]. Of the even -process elements, we determined the abundances of
Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, in addition to sulfur (see above). The Mg, Ca, and Ti abundances are slightly lower in
comparison with the iron abundance; the average excess for these elements is [X/F e] = −0.18. Sodium is
overabundant in the atmosphere of IRAS 20508, [N a/F e] = +0.58, which may be due to the synthesis of
sodium in the course of hydrogen burning [48, 49]. Some of the derived Na excess is probably due to our
failure to take into account superionization of the sodium atoms [50]. The small derived aluminium excess,
[Al/F e] = +0.32 is inconsistent with the oxygen excess, as was previously obtained for K 413 [42]: an Al–O
anticorrelation [51] is usually observed for evolved stars in globular clusters with average deﬁcits of metals.
Iron peak elements. The average abundances of iron-group metals (vanadium, chrom, manganese, cobalt,
nickel) diﬀer little from the iron abundance: [met/F e] = −0.04. Individual iron-group elements display no
signiﬁcant deviations towards either over- or underabundances relative to iron. The abundance of copper is
slightly low for both stars ([Cu/F e] = −0.23); this value is determined from only two lines, and its signiﬁcance
is fairly low. Heavy metals. It is generally accepted (see, for example, [52]) that the atmospheres of AGB
and post-AGB stars may display excesses of heavy metals, due to neutron capture, mixing, and the ejection
of matter that has undergone these processes from the stellar interior to its surface. However, in contrast to
the expected excess, the atmosphere of the optical component of IRAS 20508 displays a reduced abundance
of barium: [Ba/F e] ≈ −0.4 (Tables 3, 4). The abundances of the lighter s-process metals Y and Zr are also
reduced relative to that of iron: [s/F e] = −0.28. The deﬁcit is less severe for the lanthanides La, Ce, Pr,
Nd: [lant/F e] = −0.11. A similar weak deﬁcit was obtained for the r-process element Eu: [Eu/F e] = −0.07.
Deﬁcits of s-process elements are observed in the atmospheres of post-AGB stars much more frequently than
excesses [1, 14, 45, 53]. It is most likely that the observed absence of any manifestation of the ejection of
heavy metals is real, rather than being due to systematic errors in analyses of the spectra of supergiants
based on model atmospheres. The presence or absence of an excess of s-process elements is probably related
to the main parame ters of the star, namely, its initial mass and massloss rate, which specify its evolution.
Gonzalez and Wallerstein [54] suggest that the basic parameter determining the eﬃciency of the ejection of
the products of nucleosynthesis to surface layers is a star’s luminosity. We have obtained further support for
this suggestion, since the luminosity of IRAS 20508 is not very high: Mv ≈ −3m.

3.4. Evolutionary status of IRAS 20508

As we noted earlier, according to its the position in the IR color diagram, IRAS 20508 belongs to the V I b
group in the classiﬁcation of van der Veen and Habing [47]. This group includes evolved stars, which are
often variable and have oxygen-enriched circumstellar envelopes. AGB objects are represented by Mira-
type stars, carbon stars, and OH/IR stars. The Miras possess comparatively hot envelopes, are associated
with H2O masers and maser sources radiating mainly in the main OH band, and descend from stars that
have undergone mass loss at rates below 10−5M⊙/yr [55]. OH/IR stars are thought to be the ﬁnal stage of
evolution of oxygenrich AGB stars that have undergone mass loss at larger rates (exceeding 10−5M⊙/yr) and
are rapidly evolving towards the PPN stage. Unfortunately, no observations in water maser or OH bands are
available for IRAS 20508, hindering unambiguous classiﬁcation of the envelope. However, it may be that, in
the case of IRAS 20508, we are observing an extremely early phase of PPN formation, immediately after the
termination of mass loss and the beginning of the separation of the envelope. Excesses of neither lithium nor
s-process elements were detected in the atmosphere of IRAS 20508. The mixing that took place in the object
is only indicated by the overabundance of CN O–group elements, which are products of helium burning. In
the case of IRAS 20508, we have obtained further conﬁrmation of the well known corellation [14, 56] between

the C/O ratio and the abundance of s-process elements in the atmospheres of and post-AGB stars. Note also
that the parameters of the atmosphere of IRAS 20508, its metallicity, and details of its chemical composition
essentially coincide with those for the OH/IR star associated with IRAS 18123+0511 [57].

4. Conclusions

Our high-resolution optical spectroscopic observations made with the 6-m SAO telescope have revealed
spectral variability of the cool star with a high absolute luminosity associated with the IR source
IRAS 20508+2011. We have identiﬁed lines in the spectrum at wavelengths from 4300 to 7930 ˚A, and mea-
sured the equivalent widths and radial velocities of numerous absorption lines of neutral atoms and ions.
The radial velocity of the star derived from the photospheric absorption lines is variable: over ﬁve years of
observations, it varied in the interval 15–30 km/s. Over the same time, the Hα absorption-emission proﬁle
also varied substantially: a bell-shaped emission line with only a small amount of core absorption was trans-
formed into a two-peak emission feature with central absorption below the continuum. Further observations
with higher spectral resolution are required to explain this variability. The Na D doublet lines also display
a complex proﬁle that consists of broad (with half-width 120 km/s) emission, whose position corresponds to
that of photospheric absorption lines in the spectrum, and narrow absorption with an interstellar origin. The
derived parameters of the star (its luminosity, eﬀective temperature Tef f = 4800 K, gravitational accelera-
tion log g = 1.5, microturbulent velocity ξt = 4.0 km/s, and metallicity [F e/H] = −0.36) indicate that the
optical component of IRAS 20508+2011 is a star that is close to the AGB stage with an absolute magnitude
of Mv − 3m at a distance of d ≈ 10 kpc.

The chemical composition of its atmosphere is fairly usual for this evolutionary stage. The relation
between the carbon excess [C/F e] ≈ +0.9 and oxygen excess [O/F e] = +1.79 suggests that IRAS 20508 is
a member of the group of evolved stars with oxygen-enriched atmospheres ([C/O] = −0.9), consistent with
its position in the IR colour diagram. No excess of s-process elements is observed, which correlates well with
the low absolute luminosity of the star and the ratio of its carbon and oxygen abundances, [C/O].
