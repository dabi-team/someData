Abstract. We present an updated set of constraints for the progenitor
of PSR J0737-3039 and for the natal kicks imparted to pulsar B taking
into account both the evolutionary and kinematic history of the double
neutron star. For this purpose, we use recently reported scintillation ve-
locity measurements to trace the motion of the system in the Galaxy
backwards in time as a function of the unknown orientation Ω of the sys-
temic velocity projected on plane of the sky as well as the unknown radial
velocity Vr. The absolute limits on the orbital separation and the mass
of pulsar B’s helium star progenitor just before its supernova explosion
are 1.2 R⊙ ∼< A0 ∼< 1.7 R⊙ and 2.1 M⊙ ∼< M0 ∼< 4.7 M⊙. The kick ve-
locity is constrained to be between 60 km s−1 and 1660 km s−1 and to be
misaligned from the pre-SN orbital angular axis (which could be associ-
ated with pulsar B’s spin axis) by least 25◦ . We also derive probability
distribution functions for the kick velocity imparted to pulsar B and for
the misalignment angle between pulsar A’s spin and the post-supernova
orbital angular momentum for both isotropic and polar kicks. The most
probable values of both quantities depend sensitively on the unknown
radial velocity. In particular, tilt angles lower than 30◦–50◦ tend to be
favored for current radial velocities of less than ≃ 500 km s−1 in absolute
value, while tilt angles higher than 120◦ tend to be associated with radial
velocities in excess of ≃ 1000 km s−1 in absolute value.

Introduction

The recent discovery of the strongly relativistic binary pulsar (Burgay et al.
2003) which is also the ﬁrst eclipsing double pulsar system found in our Galaxy
(Lyne et al. 2004) has resparked the interest in the evolutionary history and
formation of double neutron star (DNS) systems (Willems & Kalogera 2004;
Dewi & van den Heuvel 2004; Willems, Kalogera & Henninger 2004). According
to the standard formation channel for DNS binaries (e.g. Bhattacharya & van
den Heuvel 1991), their progenitors evolve through a high-mass X-ray binary
phase where the ﬁrst-formed NS accretes matter from the wind of a high-mass
companion. When the latter ﬁlls its Roche lobe, the extreme mass ratio triggers
the formation of a common envelope which extracts orbital energy and angular
momentum and causes the NS and donor core to spiral-in towards each other.
If the inspiral can be stopped before the components coalesce, a tight binary is

formed consisting of the ﬁrst-formed NS and a helium star companion. After it
exhausts its central helium supply, the helium star expands and a second, this
time stable, mass-transfer phase is initiated which spins the NS up to millisecond
periods. At the end of the mass-transfer phase the helium star’s core explodes
and forms the second NS.

In this paper, we present constraints on the properties of the progenitor
of PSR J0737-3039 just before the supernova (SN) explosion that gives birth to
pulsar B. In view of the recent scintillation velocity measurements, which were
ﬁrst presented at the meeting (Ransom et al., these proceedings) and updated
shortly thereafter (Ransom et al. 2004), we update our results presented at the
conference and account for the system’s full kinematic history since the time of
its formation. We furthermore present probability distribution functions (PDFs)
for the kick velocity imparted to pulsar B and, in reply to the call for theorists’
predictions on PSR J0737-3039, we predict the most likely misalignment angle
between pulsar A’s spin and the post-SN orbital angular momentum as a function
of Vr.

2. Progenitor constraints

In order to derive constraints on the pre-SN binary parameters and the kick im-
parted to pulsar B, we ﬁrst use the scintillation velocity components determined
by Ransom et al. (2004) to trace the Galactic motion of the system backwards
in time as a function of the unknown orientation Ω of the scintillation velocity
in the plane of the sky and the unknown radial velocity Vr. Assuming that the
system is at most 100 Myr old, we ﬁnd that it may have crossed the Galactic

plane twice in the past.
sites yields estimates for the age and post-SN peculiar velocity which are shown
in Fig. 1 as a function of Ω and Vr.
If the system has crossed the Galactic
plane only once in the past, there is a wide range of Ω- and Vr-values for which
PSR J0737-3039 may be remarkably young (∼< 20 Myr). If, on the other hand,
the system has crossed the Galactic plane twice, it is at least 20 Myr old regard-
less of the values of Ω and Vr. The peculiar velocity right after the formation of
pulsar B may furthermore be anywhere between ≃ 90 km s−1 and ≃ 1200 km s−1.
Next, we determine the post-SN orbital parameters for each possible birth
site by integrating the equations governing the orbital evolution due to gravi-
tational radiation backwards in time up to the age corresponding to that birth
site. These post-SN binary parameters are related to the pre-SN parameters and
to the kick magnitude and direction by the conservation laws of orbital energy
and angular momentum. The requirements that (i) the solutions to these rela-
tions must be real, (ii) the binary components must remain bound after the SN
explosion, (iii) the post-SN orbit must pass through the position of both stars at
the time of the SN explosion, and (iv) the kick must produce the right post-SN
peculiar velocity, then impose constraints on the pre-SN orbital separation and
on the mass of pulsar B’s helium star progenitor as well as on the magnitude
and direction of the kick imparted to pulsar B (for more details, see Willems et
al. 2004, and references therein).

Regardless of the values of the two unknown parameters Ω and Vr, the pre-
SN orbital separation is constrained to the interval between 1.2 R⊙ and 1.7 R⊙.

(right) of PSR J0737-3039 as a function of Ω and Vr. Cases A and B
respectively refer to the ﬁrst and second Galactic plane crossing when
following the orbit of the system backwards in time.

For these tight constraints, the system is able to avoid Roche-lobe overﬂow prior
to the formation of pulsar B only if the mass of B’s helium star progenitor is
higher than 25 M⊙ and if the kick velocity imparted to pulsar B at birth was
larger than ≃ 1200 km s−1. Helium stars of such a high mass are not only very
unlikely (due to the strong wind mass loss), they are also expected to end up as
a black hole instead of a NS. The pre-SN binary therefore most likely consisted
of the ﬁrst-formed NS in orbit around a Roche-lobe ﬁlling helium star (see also
Dewi & van den Heuvel 2004). We constrain the mass of the latter to be between
2.1 M⊙ and 4.7 M⊙, where the lower mass limit corresponds to the smallest mass
for which a single helium star is expected to form a NS and the upper limit to the
highest mass for which mass transfer onto the ﬁrst-formed NS is expected to be
dynamically stable (Ivanova et al. 2003). The lower limit of 2.1 M⊙ furthermore
implies that a birth kick with a velocity of at least 60 km s−1 was imparted
to the second-born NS, in agreement with the minimum kick velocity derived
by Willems & Kalogera (2004) and Dewi & van den Heuvel (2004). From the
condition that the binary must remain bound after the second SN explosion, we
also derived an upper limit for the kick velocity of 1660 km s−1. The direction of
the kick is constrained to always make an angle of at least 115◦ with the helium
star’s pre-SN orbital velocity, and and angle of at least 25◦–30◦ with the pre-SN
orbital angular momentum axis (which could be associated with pulsar B’s spin
axis). Hence, the kicks are generally directed opposite to the orbital motion and

could not have been too closely aligned or anti-aligned with the pre-SN orbital
angular momentum.

For speciﬁc values of Ω and Vr, the progenitor and kick velocity properties
often become much more constrained than the absolute limits mentioned above.
In particular, the condition that the kick must match the post-SN peculiar
velocity associated with the considered values of Ω and Vr narrows the range
of possible kick velocities to an interval that is about ≃ 500 km s−1 wide. The
minimum kick velocity and the tendency of the kick to be directed opposite to
the pre-SN orbital motion furthermore increase with increasing absolute values
of the radial velocity. For a detailed representation of the progenitor and kick
constraints as a function of Ω and Vr, we refer to Willems et al. (2004).

Isotropic kick-velocity and spin-tilt distributions

Following the procedure described in detail in Willems et al. (2004), we derive
probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the kick velocity Vk imparted to
pulsar B at birth and for the misalignment angle λ between pulsar A’s spin
and the post-SN orbital angular momentum under the assumption that all kick
directions are equally probable. The PDFs are ﬁrst derived for all admissible
values of Ω and Vr, and next integrated over all possible Ω-angles assuming a
uniform distribution between 0 and 2π. The resulting PDFs are shown in Figs. 2
and 3 as functions of the remaining unknown parameter Vr.

As Fig. 1, but for the spin-orbit misalignment angle λ.

The kick-velocity distributions exhibit a single peak at kick velocities which
increase from ≃ 100 km s−1 to ≃ 1600–1700 km s−1 with increasing absolute
values of the radial velocity. This is in contrast to the single most probably
kick velocity of ≃ 150 km s−1 found by Willems & Kalogera (2004). The wider
range found here is associated with the relation between the kick magnitude
and the post-SN peculiar velocity which tends to select those kick velocities
from the admissible range which are able to explain the motion of the system
in the Galaxy (high space velocities cannot be explained by low kick velocities
and vice versa). However, for a given radial velocity, the range of kick velocities
with non-vanishingly small probabilities is always much more constrained than
in Willems & Kalogera (2004).

The tilt-angle distributions, on the other hand, clearly favor tilt angles be-
low 30◦–50◦ when (i) the system has crossed the Galactic plane twice in the past
or (ii) the system has crossed the Galactic plane once and has a current radial
velocity of less than ≃ 500 km s−1 in absolute value. Higher tilt angles tend to
be associated with one disk crossing and much higher radial velocities of ≃ 500–
1200 km s−1 in absolute value. Tilt angles close to 90◦ are furthermore strongly
disfavored for any radial velocity Vr. The overall behavior of the PDFs thus
supports the tilt angles of 16◦ ± 10◦ or 164◦ ± 10◦ predicted by the geometrical
model of Jenet & Ransom (2004), as well as the problems with their alternative
solutions of 82◦ ± 16◦ or 98◦ ± 16◦ which are incompatible with the misalignment
angle between the pulsar’s spin and magnetic dipole axes derived by Demorest
et al. (2004).

4. Non-isotropic kicks

In view of recent claims of alignment of NS kicks with NS spin axes (e.g. Romani
2004, these proceedings), it is also interesting to consider the constraints on the
progenitor and formation of PSR J0737-3039 in the case where the kick direction
is conﬁned within two oppositely directed cones with an opening angle of 30◦
and with axes parallel to the pre-SN orbital angular momentum axis (i.e. polar
kicks). The conﬁnement of the kick directions strongly reduces the range of
radial velocities for which viable progenitors for PSR J0737-3039 may be found
and greatly tightens the constraints described in the previous sections: the mass
of pulsar B’s helium star progenitor becomes constrained to M0 ≃ 2.1–2.5 M⊙,
the pre-SN orbital separation to A0 ≃ 1.1–1.5 R⊙, and the magnitude of the kick
velocity to Vk ≃ 100–600 km s−1. The range of most probable kick velocities
furthermore shrinks to ≃ 200–550 km s−1, and the range of most probable tilt
angles to 15◦–45◦.

5. Concluding remarks

We have used the scintillation velocity measurements of Ransom et al. (2004)
to derive the most up-to-date constraints on the progenitor of PSR J0737-3039
and on the kick imparted to pulsar B at birth as a function of the unknown
orientation Ω of the systemic velocity projected on plane of the sky and the
unknown radial velocity Vr. We also derived the most probable pulsar kick
velocity and spin tilt for both isotropic and polar kicks as a function of Vr. Once
Ω is measured in the coming year, it will be straightforward to use the results
presented here to further constrain the natal kicks and the spin-tilt predictions.
