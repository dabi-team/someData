The notion of analyticity is studied in the context of hypercomplex numbers. A critical review
of the problems arising from the conventional approach is given. We describe a local analyticity
condition which yields the desired type of hypercomplex solutions. The result is the deﬁnition of a
generalized complex analyticity to hypercomplex space.

I. INTRODUCTION

When in 1843, searching for a new numerical ﬁeld that in three dimensions operates in analogy to complex numbers
in two dimensions, the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton discovered quaternions [1], he probably was not
aware of what diﬃculties hide behind quaternions and what hostilities would arise in the Science community against
such non commutative numbers.

With the notable exception of Hamilton himself, quaternions have always met diﬃculties in ﬁnding a physical incar-
nation [2]. Notwithstanding their (implicit) technical use in the Treatise of Electricity and Magnetism by Maxwell [3],
where the ∇-operator is given in terms of the three quaternionic imaginary units i, j, k

∇ = i∂x + j∂y + k∂z ,

quaternions were quickly moved aside by the subsequent and practical vectorial algebra formulated of Gibbs and
Heaviside [4] in the 1880’s. Gibbs and Heaviside, starting from quaternionic products, introduced the usual three
dimensional scalar and vector product. It was these two products which were then preferentially applied in Physics,
in alternative to the quaternionic product. Thus, quaternions fell in disuse in Physics not many decades after they
were introduced.

While the intrinsic non commutativity of Quantum Mechanics should have encouraged the use of the quaternionic
ﬁeld as the natural underlying numerical ﬁeld [5], the diﬃculties encountered in quaternionic calculations, together
with the natural conservativism of the Science community have discriminated against the application of Hamilton’s
number ﬁeld. In particular, problems arise in the appropriate deﬁnitions of tensor product spaces, in the corrected
deﬁnition of determinant and transpose for quaternionic matrices, in the reproduction of standard trace theorems,
and in the passage from hermitian to antihermitian operators, etc.

Nevertheless, after the fundamental paper of Horwitz and Biedenharn on Gauge Theories & Quantization [6] and
Adler’s work on Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics & Quantum Fields [7,8], quaternions have gained new impulse in
Quantum Physics. Much recent progress in quaternionic applications to Mathematics and Physics have been obtained
and thus quaternions are considered with more interest nowadays. Among the recent applications of quaternions we
recall quaternionic formulations for Tensor Products [9], Group Representations [10], Special Relativity [11], Dark
Matter [12], Relativistic Quantum Mechanics [13,14], Scattering & Decay Problems [15], Field Theory [16], Hidden
Symmetry [17], Electroweak Model [18], GUTs [19], Preonic Model [20], etc. Experimental tests, which might highlight
the possible quaternionic nature of wave functions, have also been proposed [21].

Within Mathematics itself an important question remains pertinent: How is the well known complex analyticity

condition,

∂x0f (z, ¯z) = −i∂x1f (z, ¯z)

[ z = x0 + ix1

(x0, x1 ∈ R) ] ,

best extended to hypercomplex numbers including quaternions?

In this paper, we start with a critical review of the conventional approach to quaternionic analysis, showing the

disadvantages of deﬁning a quaternionic derivative in the standard form

1

 
 
 
 
∂q ≡ α∂x0 + β∂x1 + γ∂x2 + δ∂x3 ,

with α, β, γ, δ “constant” quaternionic numbers.

The main goal of our work is the demonstration that a new generalization of complex analyticity to quaternionic
numbers can be easily obtained. This occurs thanks to a local representation of the complex imaginary unit, that
yields the possibility of deﬁning a local quaternionic derivative which overcomes some previous problems. Such a
generalization is easily extended to octonionic numbers.

This paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we introduce the quaternionic algebra and the barred operators.
In Section III, after a brief introduction to complex diﬀerentiability we discuss the standard quaternionic approaches.
In Section IV, we recall some of the essential aspects of Fueter’s calculus. Section V is directed to the study of
“global” analyticity conditions. In this Section we show the impossibility of ﬁnding a suitable quaternionic derivative
by adopting the standard viewpoint. Section VI deals with the “local” hypercomplex version of the Cauchy-Riemann
equations. Our conclusions are drawn in the ﬁnal Section.

II. QUATERNIONIC ALGEBRA AND BARRED OPERATORS

Let us introduce the quaternionic algebra by trying to follow the conceptual approach of Hamilton. We begin by
looking for numbers of the form x1 + ix2 + jx3, with i2 = j2 = −1, which will do for three-dimensional space what
complex numbers have done for the plane. Inﬂuenced by the existence of a complex number norm

when we look at its generalization

¯zz = (Rez)2 + (Imz)2 ,

(x1 − ix2 − jx3)(x1 + ix2 + jx3) = x2

1 + x2

2 + x2

3 − (ij + ji)x2x3 ,

to obtain a real number, it is necessary to adopt the anticommutative law of multiplication for the imaginary units.
We now note that with only two imaginary units we have no chance of constructing a new numerical ﬁeld, because
assuming

and

we ﬁnd

ij = α1 + iα2 + jα3 ,
ji = β1 + iβ2 + jβ3 ,

ij = −ji ,

α1,2,3 = β1,2,3 = 0 .

Thus we must introduce a third imaginary unit k 6= i 6= j, with

k = ij .

This noncommutative ﬁeld is therefore characterized by three imaginary units i, j, k which satisfy the following
multiplication rules

Numbers of the form

i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1 .

q = x0 + ix1 + jx2 + kx3

( x0,1,2,3 ∈ R ) ,

(1)

(2)

are called (real) quaternions. They are added, subtracted and multiplied according to the usual laws of arithmetic,
except for the commutative law of multiplication.

An important diﬀerence between quaternionic and complex numbers is related to the deﬁnition of the conjugation

operation. Whereas with complex numbers we can deﬁne only one type of conjugation

2

working with quaternionic numbers we can introduce diﬀerent conjugation operations. Indeed, with three imaginary
units we have the possibility to deﬁne besides the standard conjugation

¯q = x0 − ix1 − jx2 − kx3 ,

(3)

i → −i ,

the six new operations

(i, j, k) → (−i, +j, +k) , (+i, −j, +k) , (+i, +j, −k) ;
(i, j, k) → (+i, −j, −k) , (−i, +j, −k) , (−i, −j, +k) .

These last six conjugations can be concisely expressed in terms of q and ¯q by

q → −i¯qi , − j ¯qj , − k ¯qk ,
q → −iqi , − jqj , − kqk .

It might seem that the only independent conjugation be represented by ¯q. Nevertheless, ¯q can also be expressed in
terms of q

¯q = −

1
2

(q + iqi + jqj + kqk) .

(4)

So we conclude that while within a complex theory z and ¯z represent independent variables, in a quaternionic theory
all the seven conjugations can be deﬁned as involutions of the quaternionic variable q. We will return to this point
later.

Let us now introduce formally the so-called barred operators, already implicit in the previous formulas. In recent
years the left/right-action of the quaternionic imaginary units, expressed by barred operators [22], has been very
useful in overcoming diﬃculties owing to the noncommutativity of quaternionic numbers. Among the successful
applications of barred operators we mention the one-dimensional quaternionic formulation of Lorentz boosts [11]
and new possibilities for Quaternionic Group Theories [19]. Partially-barred quaternions also appear in Quantum
Mechanics, e.g they allow an appropriate deﬁnition of the momentum operator, in a quaternionic version of Dirac’s
equation [13] and Electroweak Model [18].

The most general barred quaternionic operator is represented by

q0 + q1 | i + q2 | j + q3 | k

( q0,1,2,3 ∈ H ) .

(5)

where 1 | i, 1 | j and 1 | k indicate the right-action of the quaternionic imaginary units. The application of q1 | q2
to a third quaternion q3 is by deﬁnition q1q3q2. The multiplication rules are simple once seen. For example, in the
multiplication of two particular barred quaternions, j | k and i | j, we ﬁnd

(j | k) × (i | j) = ji | jk = −k | i .

We also observe that in this example j | k and i | j represent commuting quaternionic barred operators.

Let us now analyze the link between complex/quaternion numbers and real matrices. We know that the action of

a complex number on z can be given in terms of real matrices. In fact, identifying z with the vector column

the action on z by the complex number a + ib is expressed by the following real matrix

x0
x1 (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

a −b
b a (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

(6)

(7)

Obviously this involves only particular real matrices. This corresponds to the fact that complex numbers are charac-
terized by two real parameters whereas the most general 2 × 2 real matrix by four. The restriction in Eq. (7) precludes
one from obtaining from (6) the complex conjugate

¯z ≡

x0
-x1 (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

3

and whence we see again, in another way, that z and ¯z represent independent variables. The situation, drastically
changes for quaternions. If we represent a quaternionic number, q, by the column vector

x0
x1
x2
x3






,






the most general action we can perform on this column vector is obviously given by a 4 × 4 real matrix (16 real
parameters). But, due to the noncommutative nature of quaternions, the most general transformation on quaternionic
numbers is represented by the barred quaternions (5), characterized by just 16 real parameters. So we have a full
connection between 4 × 4 real matrices and quaternions. The situation can be concisely summarized as follows

There is another important distinction between complex and quaternionic numbers. The requirement that a function
of a complex variable z = x0 + ix1 should be a complex polynomial function f (x0, x1) + ig(x0, x1) picks out a proper
subset of the polynomial functions. However, the corresponding requirement of a function of a quaternionic variable,
q, namely that it should be a sum of monomials of the type

places no restriction on the function. In contrast to the complex case the coordinates x0, ~x can themselves be written
as quaternionic polynomials

aoqa1...az−1qar

(an ∈ H) .

x0 = Pr q ≡

1 − i | i − j | j − k | k
4

q ,

( ix1, jx2, kx3 ) = ( − iPri q, −jPrj q, −kPrk q ) ≡ ( Pi q , Pj q , Pk q ) ,

or explicitly,

x0 =

x2 = −

x3 = −

(1 − i | i − j | j − k | k) q ,

(1 − i | i + j | j + k | k) q ,

(1 + i | i − j | j + k | k) q ,

(1 + i | i + j | j − k | k) q ,

and so every real polynomial in (x0, ~x) can be written as quaternionic polynomial in q by combinations of

q , − iqi

, − jqj , − kqk .

Thus, a theory of quaternionic power series will be the same as a theory of real power series functions in R4.

Consequently, while working within complex numbers we have no possibility to express ¯z by z, so that it is necessary

to consider a general function f as f (z, ¯z),

f0(x0, x1) + if1(x0, x1) → f (z, ¯z)

( f0,1 ∈ R , f ∈ C ) .

In quaternionic theories, due to the noncommutativity, ¯q (and all other conjugates) can be written in terms of q, by
quaternionic barred operators, e.g.

¯q = −

1 + i | i + j | j + k | k
2

q ,

thus, we can in all generality refer to f (q) instead of f (q, ¯q, ...),

f0(x0, ~x) + if1(x0, ~x) + jf2(x0, ~x) + kf3(x0, ~x) → f (q)

( f0,1,2,3 ∈ R , f ∈ H ) .

III. QUATERNIONIC DIFFERENTIABILITY

It is well known that a point in the two-dimensional real Euclidean space (x0, x1) can be naturally expressed by a

complex number

z = x0 + ix1

and that the most general conformal coordinate transformation in two dimension is analytic in this complex coordinate.
In four dimensions, coordinates can be represented by a quaternion as naturally as, in two dimensions, they are uniﬁed
into a complex number. Thus, it is natural to ask whether the notion of analyticity can be extended to quaternions.
Before discussing hypercomplex analyticity, let us brieﬂy recall the traditional approach to the notion of complex

analyticity. A function whose arguments are complex numbers x0 ± ix1 is deﬁned as

f (z, ¯z) = u(x0, x1) + iv(x0, x1) ,

(8)

where u(x0, x1) and v(x0, x1) are real functions of the real arguments x0 and x1. The standard theory of analytic
functions deals only with a restricted but important class of functions of two real variables, namely, those functions
that satisfy the requirement of being “diﬀerentiable”. Though diﬀerentiability of a function of a complex variable
places, as we said, a severe limitation on the functions one is allowed to consider, it leads to a theory of these functions
that is both elegant and extremely powerful. We aim to extend the standard discussion on the diﬀerentiability of
functions of a complex variable to quaternionic functions of a quaternionic (and even octonionic) variable.

The derivative of a function of a complex variable with respect to the argument z is formally deﬁned in the same
way as it is for functions of a real variable (complex numbers commute and so the position of the factor 1/∆z below
is not relevant)

∂zf (z, ¯z) = lim
∆z→0

f (z + ∆z, ¯z + ∆¯z) − f (z)
∆z

,

(9)

with ∆z = ∆x0 + i∆x1. The limit in the previous equation will, in general, depend upon the order on which ∆x0,
∆x1 tend to zero. We say that a function of a complex argument is diﬀerentiable if the limit (9) exists, is ﬁnite, and
does not depend on the manner in which one takes the limit. Whereas in the case of a real variable, one can approach
a given point only in two ways (either from the left or from the right), a point in the complex plane can be reached
from an inﬁnite number of directions. Thus, instead of the single requirement for a function of a real variable,

Lef t limit

≡

Right limit ,

an inﬁnite number of such requirements has to be satisﬁed in order to ensure the diﬀerentiability of a function of a
complex variable. One can understand therefore, why the property of being diﬀerentiable is, in the case of functions
of a complex variable, very much more restrictive than it is for functions of a real variable.

The necessary and suﬃcient condition for a function of a complex variable to be diﬀerentiable at a given point is that,
at that point, it obeys the Cauchy-Riemann conditions. Such conditions are obtained by imposing the requirement
that the right-hand side of (9) yields the same result, whatever the order in which the limit ∆x0 ∆x1 → 0 is taken.
By ﬁrst setting ∆x1 = 0 and then taking the limit ∆x0 → 0 we ﬁnd

∂zf (z, ¯z) = ∂x0u(x0, x1) + i∂x0v(x0, x1) .

In the other case, in which we ﬁrst set ∆x0 = 0 and then take the limit ∆x1 → 0 we ﬁnd

∂zf (z, ¯z) = −i∂x1u(x0, x1) + ∂x1v(x0, x1) .

By equating the real and imaginary parts of Eqs. (10, 11), we obtain the Cauchy-Riemann conditions:

or equivalently

∂x0u = ∂x1v

and

∂x1u = −∂x0v ,

∂x0f (z, ¯z) = −i∂x1f (z, ¯z) .

The real and imaginary parts of a diﬀerentiable function separately satisfy the Laplace equation

(10)

(11)

(12)

(∂2

x0 + ∂2

x1)u = (∂2

x0 + ∂2

x1)v = 0 ,

5

and are therefore harmonic functions of two variables (the converse is not necessarily true).

The net result of (12) is that an analytic f does not depend upon ¯z, is expandable in a power series in z, and this
in turn justiﬁes the a priori dubious convention of use of the terminology functions of a complex variable. Indeed,
deﬁning the complex derivative by

and requiring that

we obtain

∂z ≡ α∂x0 + β∂x1

( α, β ∈ C ) ,

∂zz = 1

and

∂z ¯z = 0 ,

∂z ≡

1
2

(∂x0 − i∂x1) .

The corresponding conjugate complex derivative is

∂¯z ≡

1
2

(∂x0 + i∂x1) .

The Cauchy-Riemann condition can then be written in compact form as,

∂¯zf (z, ¯z) = 0

1
2

(cid:20)

(∂x0 + i∂x1)

.

(cid:21)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

Thus, these conditions have as a consequence that a mathematical expression deﬁning a z-diﬀerentiable function can
depend explicitly only on z = x0 + ix1 but not on ¯z = x0 − ix1. We also obtain the complex Laplace equation

✷f (z) = 0

( ✷ ≡ ∂z∂¯z ) .

(17)

What happens in higher dimensions? Which is the quaternionic counterpart of ∂z? Are there problems due to the

noncommutativity of quaternions?

There is a substantial body of literature on attempted constructions of theories of analytic functions of both real
(and even complexiﬁed) quaternions.
In seeking to construct a diﬀerential and integral calculus of quaternionic
functions the ﬁrst step should be the deﬁnition of a derivative. A straightforward extension of the complex derivative
could be

∂¯q ≡

1
2 (cid:18)

∂x0 +

i∂x1 + j∂x2 + k∂x3
3

,

(cid:19)

where ∂¯q has been deﬁned in such a way that

∂¯qq = 0

and

∂¯q ¯q = 1 ,

in analogy with the above complex case. Consequently the Cauchy-Riemann condition would be generalized to

∂x0f (q) = −

i∂x1 + j∂x2 + k∂x3
3

f (q) .

(18)

However, due to the noncommutativity of quaternionic numbers, the only solution to Eq. (18) in the form of a power
series of q is

f (q) = c1 + qc2

( c1, c2 ∈ H ) .

So we ﬁnd only linear functions in q as solution. Even if these are not the only solutions. This is for too restrictive
to yield any practical use. We also note that (18) does not reduce to (12) for complex functions, and indeed does not
include the standard complex solutions f (z).

A somewhat diﬀerent approach extends the concept of holomorphism, which for hypercomplex numbers need not
coincide with analyticity. Working with a noncommutative ﬁeld we need to deﬁne a left or right derivative. In fact in
the quaternionic version of Eq. (9) we must specify the position of the factor 1/∆q. A right quaternionic derivative
of the function f (q) might be formed by requiring (in analogy to the complex case) that the limit

6

∂qf (q) = lim
∆q→0

[f (q + ∆q) − f (q)]/∆q

(19)

exists and be independent of path for all increments ∆q. By considering four linearly independent increments ∆x0,
i∆x1, j∆x2, k∆x3 we can derive a set of partial diﬀerential equations to be satisﬁed relating the components of f (q)

∂x0 f (q) = −i∂x1f (q) = −j∂x2f (q) = −k∂x3f (q) .

(20)

This approach also leads to nothing productive since, even for the simple function q2, the

is not independent of the variation ∆q. Even here we do not encompass complex analyticity. Indeed for functions
independent of both x2 and x3,the above equations allow only constant functions as solutions.

∆q→0

∆f /∆q

IV. FUETER ANALYTICITY

Among the diﬀerent approaches to hypercomplex analyticity, the most important appears to be that of Fueter [23]
and his school in Z¨urich in the 1930’s. He showed that a third order analytic equation yields generalizations of
Cauchy’s theorem, Cauchy’s integral formula, and the Laurent expansion [24,25]. Whatismore, the Fueter quaternionic
analyticity [26] has the appreciable virtue of selecting something less restrictive than Eqs. (18,20).

To construct series with quaternionic coeﬃcients endowed with the ring property we have to consider the general

quaternionic polynomial

p(q) = a0 + a1q + qa2 + a3qa4 +

b1q2 + q2b2 + a3q2a4 + b5qb6qb7 +
. . .

(21)

which is just a ﬁnite sum of quaternionic monomials m(q), e. g.

m(q) = α0qα2q...αr−1qαr

of degree r and with constant quaternions α0,...,r. The polynomial p(q) is called general quaternionic since it has no
holomorphic property. Fueter considered various subgroups of the general mapping (21), the so-called Weiestrass-like
series

L(q) =

qnan

or R(q) =

anqn

[ an ∈ H ] ,

Xn

Xn

corresponding, respectively, to left and right holomorphic mappings.

In analogy to the complex case, four derivative operators are introduced by

DL
DL
DR
DR

¯q f (q) ≡ ∂x0f (q) + i∂x1f (q) + j∂x2f (q) + k∂x3 f (q) ,
q f (q) ≡ ∂x0f (q) − i∂x1f (q) − j∂x2f (q) − k∂x3 f (q) ,
¯q f (q) ≡ ∂x0f (q) + ∂x1f (q)i + ∂x2f (q)j + ∂x3 f (q)k ,
q f (q) ≡ ∂x0f (q) − ∂x1f (q)i − ∂x2f (q)j − ∂x3 f (q)k .

(22)

(23)

The functions

l(q) = DL

¯q DL

q L(q) = ✷L(q) and r(q) = DR

¯q DR

q R(q) = ✷R(q) ,

represent, for Fueter, left and right analytic functions since they are annihilated, respectively by the operators DL
¯q
and DR
¯q

DL

¯q l(q) = DR

¯q r(q) = 0 .

So the functions L(q) and R(q) satisfy some Cauchy-Riemann-like condition, but of the third order in derivatives
instead of the ﬁrst. The “ﬁrst order” Laplace equations ✷L(q) = 0 and ✷R(q) = 0 do not hold in general; however
the “second order” Laplace equations ✷2L(q) = 0 and ✷2R(q) = 0 are valid.

Note that given the essential third order nature of the Fueter equations there is no simple limit to the complex

case. We shall return to this in the conclusions.

7

V. GLOBAL QUATERNIONIC DERIVATIVE

Returning to ﬁrst order analytic equations, let us analyze a more general case than that of Section III. Consider

arbitrary coeﬃcients ∈ H of the “real” derivatives

(24)

(25)

∂q ≡ α∂x0 + β∂x1 + γ∂x2 + δ∂x3

( α, β, γ, δ ∈ H ) .

We ﬁnd an immediate problem if we require that our quaternionic derivative satisﬁes

∂qq = 1

and

∂qq2 = 2q .

In fact we obtain the following constraints for the quaternionic coeﬃcients α, β, γ, δ

α + βi + γj + δk = 1 ,
αi − β = i , αj − γ = j , αk − δ = k .

Combining the last three equations we have

which, when coupled with the ﬁrst one gives the trivial solution

3α + βi + γj + δk = 3 ,

and consequently

α = 1

β = γ = δ = 0 .

Allowing barred quaternionic coeﬃcients for our quaternionic derivatives, a possible solution to the constraints

coming from Eq. (25) is given by

α = 1 − i | i − j | j − k | k ,
2β = k | j − j | k , 2γ = i | k − k | i , 2δ = j | i − i | j .

An immediate check veriﬁes that

(α, β, γ, δ) × 1 = (4, −i, −j, −k) ,
(α, β, γ, δ) × (i, j, k) = (0, −1, 0, 0 ; 0, 0, −1, 0 ; 0, 0, 0, −1) ,

and so the constraints on α, β, γ, δ are respected. Nevertheless, the constraints coming from the requirement that
the quaternionic derivative of q3 be 3q2 are

α1 + βi + 1

α1 + βi + γj + δk = 1 ,
αi − β1 = i , αj − γ1 = j , αk − δ1 = k ,
3 (βi + δk) = α1 + δk + 1

3 (γj + δk) = α1 + γj + 1

βj + γi = βk + δi = γk + δj = 0 .

3 (βi + γk) = 1 ,

Immediately we obtain

and so again only the trivial solution exists

βi + γj = βi + δk = γj + δk = 0 ,

α = 1

and

β = γ = δ = 0 .

We conclude this Section with the result that it is not possible to obtain a satisfactory generalization (e.g.
Weiestrass-like series in q) of the complex derivative to the quaternionic ﬁeld if the quaternionic derivative is de-
ﬁned in terms of constant quaternionic (even barred) coeﬃcients. In the next Section we will show how the solution
arises by deﬁning “local” quaternionic coeﬃcients.

8

VI. LOCAL ANALYTICITY

We rewrite the quaternion q by introducing a “local” imaginary unit iota, in the following form

q = x0 + ix1 + jx2 + kx3 → x0 + ιx .

(26)

with

and

x ≡ |~x|

[ ~x ≡ (x1, x2, x3) ]

ι ≡

ix1 + jx2 + kx3
x

.

The quaternion q assumes a more familiar form (a complex number) and it becomes natural to deﬁne the quaternionic
derivative in terms of the local imaginary unit ι as

∂q =

1
2

(∂x0 − ι∂x) .

With ι held ﬁxed (derivative within the ι-complex plane) we have,

In terms of the global quaternionic imaginary units i, j and k Eq. (27) reads

x∂x ≡ x1∂x1 + x2∂x2 + x3∂x3 .

where

∂q =

∂x0 − ~Q · ˆx ˆx · ~∂

1
2 (cid:16)

,

(cid:17)

~Q ≡ (i, j, k) ,
~∂ ≡ (∂x1 , ∂x2, ∂x3) ,
ˆx ≡ ~x/x .

(27)

This is a “local” derivative because the coeﬃcients of ∂/∂1,2,3 depend upon the point q. To check the consistence of
our quaternionic derivative it is suﬃcient to observe that

∂x(ιx) = ∂x(ix1 + jx2 + kx3)

We are now able to extend to quaternionic ﬁelds the Cauchy-Riemann conditions. Explicitly, we ﬁnd the following
quaternionic analyticity requirements:

con f (q) = f0 + if1 + jf2 + kf3 ed f0,1,2,3 real functions. Eq. (29) can be also rewritten in terms of (i, j, k) as follows

∂x0 f (q) = −ι∂xf (q) ,

(29)

∂x0 f0 + ~Q · ∂x0

~f = ˆx · D ~f − ~Q ·

ˆxDf0 + ˆx ∧ D ~f

where

~f ≡ (f1, f2, f3) ,
D ≡ ˆx · ~∂ .

The solutions to Eq. (29) are immediate from complex analysis. They consist of all polinomials in q (the “complex”
q) with arbitrary right acting quaternionic coeﬃcients. Thus we re-obtain the Fueter solutions from a local diﬀerential
equation. These solutions also contain the “classical” complex solutions and Eq. (29) reduces to the standard complex
equation when applied to a function independent of x2 and x3.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

It is useful to recall that one of the diﬃculties of deﬁning quaternionic analyticity is that the simplest exten-
sions to four dimensions of complex analyticity tend to restrict the solutions too drastically. Another is that some
generalizations (18,20) do not yield the standard complex limit.

One solution found by Fueter involves a third order analyticity condition and yields as solutions a class of polinomials
in q with right (or left according to the derivative operator used) quaternionic coeﬃcients. These solutions L(q) and
R(q) are appealing generalizations of the standard complex Taylor series, while the associated functions l(q) and r(q)
satisfy integral properties which are a generalization of those of complex functions. This occurs because these latter
functions satisfy a global ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation, but as a consequence they are not simple polinomial series
in q. Furthermore, while any quaternionic function has a complex limit by, say, setting x2 and x3 to zero this does
not imply that the partial derivatives with respect to these missing variables is identically null. Similarly while the
ﬁrst order analyticity condition reduce to a complex form, the integral equations involving hypersurfaces in q-space
do not automatically become become line integrals in a complex plane. Thus l(q) and r(q) do not include complex
analytic functions.

We have shown in this work that the polinomial Fueter solutions L(q) and R(q) can be derived from a local complex
analyticity equation, i.e. by requiring merely ι-complex analyticity in the natural complex plane deﬁned by the point
(variable) q and the real axis. We observe, however, that while q only involves (by deﬁnition) ι, f (q) is more general
because of the unrestricted nature of the quaternionic coeﬃcients in its Taylor expansion.

The extensions of our approach to octonions is straightforward given the ﬁrst order nature of our analyticity

equation. The corresponding deﬁnition of ι is

ι ≡

e1x1 + e2x2 + ... + e7x7
x

.

where e1...e7 are the imaginary unit vectors and x the norm of the ”vector” part of the octonionic point. The solutions
are natural extensions of the quaternionic case.
