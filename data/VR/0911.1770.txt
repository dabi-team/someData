ABSTRACT

New R-band observations of 21 local ﬁeld RR Lyrae variable stars are used to explore
the reliability of minimum light (V − R) colors as a tool for measuring interstellar
reddening. For each star, R-band intensity mean magnitudes and light amplitudes are
presented. Corresponding V -band light curves from the literature are supplemented
with the new photometry, and (V − R) colors at minimum light are determined for a
subset of these stars as well as for other stars in the literature. Two diﬀerent deﬁnitions
of minimum light color are examined, one which uses a Fourier decomposition to the V
and R light curves to ﬁnd (V − R) at minimum V -band light, (V − R)F
min, and the other
which uses the average color between the phase interval 0.5-0.8, (V − R)φ(0.5−0.8)
. From
31 stars with a wide range of metallicities and pulsation periods, the mean dereddened
min,0 = 0.28 ± 0.02 mag and (V −R)φ(0.5−0.8)
RR Lyrae color at minimum light is (V −R)F
= 0.27 ± 0.02 mag. As was found by Guldenschuh et al. (2005) using (V − I) colors,
any dependence of the star’s minimum light color on metallicity or pulsation amplitude
is too weak to be formally detected. We ﬁnd that the intrinsic (V − R) of Galactic
bulge RR Lyrae stars are similar to those found by their local counterparts and hence
that Bulge RR0 Lyrae stars do not have anomalous colors as compared to the local RR
Lyrae stars.

Introduction

RR Lyrae variables play an important role in the determination of distances to the Galactic
center, globular clusters, and neighboring galaxies. This information is of fundamental importance

 
 
 
 
 
 
– 2 –

in the study of galactic structure and dynamics.
In addition, RR Lyraes provide an excellent
sample of stars to investigate kinematics in the galaxy (see, e.g., Beers et al. 2000, Layden et al.
1996, Dambis & Rastorguev 2001). Their pulsational properties combined with an almost constant
absolute magnitude make them excellent tracers of the old stellar populations.

As bulge RR Lyrae variables are among the oldest and most metal poor stars in the bulge,
their distribution and signature are of considerable importance in determing the mix of populations
in the Galactic bulge, and vital to our understanding of the nature of the bulge itself. RR Lyrae
variables have also advanced our understanding especially of the halo and thick disk components
of the Milky Way. For example, the SDSS (Ivezi´c 2000) and QUEST (Vivas & Zinn 2006) surveys
have used RR Lyrae stars to ﬁnd complex substructure in the Galactic halo, thick disk and thin
disk distribution. Many irregular structures, such as the Sgr dwarf tidal stream in the halo and
the Monoceros stream closer to the Galactic plane, have strengthened the notion that the Milky
Way is a complex and dynamical structure that is still being shaped by the merging of neighboring
smaller galaxies.

Regardless of how convenient a distance indicator may be, with out knowing reddening, accu-
rate distances can not be found. Especially the central regions of the Galaxy and other low latitude
areas suﬀer from severe crowding and high, patchy, reddening. It would be especially useful to have
a method of determine interstellar reddening directly from the RR Lyrae, rather than depending
on extinction maps in a certain area of the sky with perhaps low resolution and large uncertainties.

The minimum light color of RR0 Lyrae variables have been used to estimate their line-of-
sight reddenings. This is based on a concept originally developed by Sturch (1966) to investigate
E(B − V), and reﬁned by Blanco (1992). Blanco (1992) used 22 stars to derive a relationship
between an RR Lyrae variable’s line of sight color excess, E(B − V), as a function of the RR Lyrae’s
period, metalicity and minimum (B − V) color. An investigation of E(V − I) was performed by
Mateo et al. (1995) with an 11 star sample and expanded on by Guldenschuh et al. (2005) who
used 16 RR0 Lyrae variables. They found that E(V − I) depends upon only minimum (V − I) color.
Guldenschuh et al. (2005) concluded that the intrinsic minimum light color of RRab variables is
(V − I)φ(0.5−0.8)
= 0.58 ± 0.02, with very little dependence on period or metallicity for periods
between 0.39 and 0.7 days and metallicities in the range −3 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ 0. These studies deﬁne
minimum light color to be the average color over the phase range 0.5-0.8, designated here as i.e.
(V − I)φ(0.5−0.8)

for the color (V − I).

Most recently, Kunder et al. (2008) did a study on the determination of E(V − R) from RR0
Lyrae stars minimum light color using 11 stars and data in the literature. They deﬁned minimum
light color not by (V − R)φ(0.5−0.8)
min.
Fourier ﬁts to both the V - and R-band data were administered to determine this quantity. This
deﬁnition of minimum light was used because Kanbur & Fernando (2004) observed that the RR0
Lyrae in the LMC display period-color and amplitude-color relations that are ﬂat at (V − R)F

In this paper we report on new data gathered to reﬁne the relationship of reddening at mini-
mum light (V − R) color. Although V -band photometry of RR Lyrae stars is quite common in the
literature, this is not the case for the R-band. Here new R-band observations are obtained to triple
the sample of RR Lyrae stars available for intrinsic (V − R)min determinations. Our 21 program
stars were chosen to span a large range of V -amplitudes, pulsational periods and metallicities.
The V -band photometry for these stars is taken from various sources in the literature, including
Piersimoni et al. (1993), Sti¸epe´n (1972), Jones et al. (1987), Bookmeyer et al. (1977), the Behlen
Variable Star Survey(Schmidt 1991, 1995), and the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) database
(Pojmanski 2002). Both methods of determining minimum light are investigaed, (V − R) at mini-
min, and the average color over the phase range 0.5-0.8, (V−R)φ(0.5−0.8)
mum V -band light, (V−R)F
.
This reddening procedure can be applied to the thousands of RR Lyrae stars found in the MACHO
database.

The MACHO Project was designed to search for MACHOs through gravitational microlensing.
Their project surveyed the same ﬁelds in the sky of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and
the Bulge of the Milky Way. Now, after its eight years of operation from 1992-1999, the MACHO
photometric database is an unprecedented resource for the study of stellar variability. Kunder et al.
(2008) found 3674 RR0 Lyrae stars in the MACHO database, that were imaged simultaneously by
the MACHO team in the bM and rM ﬁlters. These have been transformed to standard Johnsons
V and Kron-Cousins R (Alcock et al. 1999). Using these RR Lyrae as standard candles, they can
be used to map the bulge and obtain its 3D structure, giving clues and constraining models on the
formation of the Milky Way Galaxy. As with any study of the Galactic bulge, interstellar reddening
estimates are essential to begin investigations in a quantitative manner.

Recently there has been some controversy as to if RR Lyrae variables can be used to mea-
sure reddening from their minimum light colors and if their absolute magnitudes are environment
dependent (i.e., if the intrinsic properties of RR Lyrae vary with the composition and age of the
system/environment in which they reside). Collinge, Sumi & Fabrycky (2006) compared the RR
Lyrae intrinsic color at minimum light, (V−I)φ(0.5−0.8)
, of OGLE Bulge RR Lyrae stars, dereddened
according to Sumi (2004), with ﬁeld RR Lyrae colors. They concluded that there is a discrepancy
of 0.05-0.08 mag between the RR Lyrae-to-red clump (RC) color diﬀerential of the bulge population
(measured from OGLE data) and that of the local population. Whether this is a result of a RR
Lyrae or RC color discrepancy as a function of environment has substantial implications on the
use of absolute magnitudes of RR Lyrae variables. We apply the minimum light RR Lyrae color
reddenings to the MACHO bulge RR Lyrae to check if the absolute magnitude of RR Lyrae stars
are indeed environment-independent.

The structure of this paper is the following. The observations and data is given in §2. The

– 4 –

light curves and mean observational properties of the program RR Lyrae variables are presented
in §3, and comments about individual stars follow in §4. A thorough investigation on the use of
minimum light colors to calibrate E(V − R) is presented in §5. In §6 the intrinsic minimum light
colors are then compared to RR Lyrae variables in the Galactic bulge and anomalous colors of
Galactic Bulge RR Lyrae are discussed.

2. Observations and Reductions

Observations were made over 31 nights at the WIYN 0.9 m telescope at Kitt Peak (on seven
nights over 2006 May 4-11), and at the 1.3 m McGraw-Hill Telescope at the MDM observatory
(on 24 nights from 2006 September 29 - July 02, August 30 - September 7 and from 2008 March
8-18). The WIYN Telescope was equipped with the S2KB 2048 x 2048 CCD, giving a ﬁeld of view
20.′5 on a side, with a scale of 0.”60 pixel−1. The 2048x2048 Echelle and 1024x1024 Templeton
CCDs were used on the MDM telescope, giving ﬁelds of view of 17.′3 and 8.′7 on a side, respectively,
with scales of 0.”508 pixel−1. The observations were obtained primarily in the R- ﬁlter, but some
V -band images were also obtained. On each night, twilight and dawn ﬂats were taken in the R- and
V - ﬁlters. The images were overscan-corrected, trimmed, and bias-subrated in the normal fashion
using standard IRAF tasks.

Landolt (1992) standard stars were observed in the R- and V -bands on three photometric
nights, May 6, May 7 and May 8, 2006, with a wide range of color, air mass, and universal time
that encompassed the various properties of the program stars. Ten stars in the vicinity of each
RR Lyrae variable were selected as comparison stars, which could potentially be used to perform
diﬀerential photometry on nights that were not photometric. Instrumental magnitudes of the RR
Lyrae variable, the comparison stars and the standard stars were computed from each image using
the DAOPHOT task PHOT (Stetson 1994), as implemented in IRAF.

For each photometric night, transformation equations of the form

and

r − R = cR,0 + cR,1XR + cR,2(V − R)

v − V = cV,0 + cV,1XV + cV,2(V − R)

(1)

(2)

were constructed, where r represents the instrumental magnitude, R and V is the standard magni-
tude from Landolt (1992), and XR and XV is the air mass in R and V , respectively. The coeﬃcients
were ﬁrst obtained using least-squares minimization. The coeﬃcients cR,2, the R-band color terms,
for all three nights were averaged together to ﬁnd < cR,2 >. The value of < cR,2 > is then used as
a constant in Equation 1 instead of cR,2, and the coeﬃcients cR,0 and cR,1 are found again. This
procedure was also carried out with the V -band color terms to ﬁnd < cV,2 >, and to solve for cV,o
and cV,1.

– 5 –

For the photometric night May 8, 2006, the transformation equation

r − R = co + c1XR

(3)

was also used. This is because for that particular photometric night, not many V -band images of
RR Lyrae variables were collected and hence, for a subset of the RR Lyrae variables observed on
this night, no (V − R) information at a particular phase was known. As the color terms found were
small, < cR,2 > = −0.022 and < cV,2 > = −0.011, and as the RR Lyrae colors do not vary much,
the omission of the color term is small. The rms scatter of the points around each best ﬁt is shown
in Table 1. The number of stars used in each ﬁt and the number of standard star ﬁelds observed
that night is also shown. The rms from Equation 3 with no color term is indicated by rmsR,nc.
The number of calibration images for each RR Lyrae that uses a color term (NV R) and the number
of calibrations with no color term (NR) is listed for each star in Table 2.

Once these equations were determined, we applied them to all of the comparison stars. Every
variable star ﬁeld was observed at least twice on at least two diﬀerent photometric nights. Most
variable star ﬁelds were observed 4-9 times over the three photometric nights. When averaged
together, the magnitudes for each comparison star agreed well, with the dispersion about the mean
being less than 0.012 mag in most cases. When performing diﬀerential photometry, only comparison
stars with dispersions about the mean being less than 0.025 mag were used. On average, each RR
Lyrae ﬁeld had 3 suitable comparison stars.

Over the course of the data reduction, ACL noticed that the S2KB CCD encountered an excess
of light falling near the center of the chip in the ﬂat ﬁelds. Thus a 2-4% overillumination near the
central region of the chip occured. Using Layden’s aperture mask, correction images were developed
that were applied to the data taken using this CCD.

The tables in Appendix A present the photometry thus obtained. The columns contain (1) the
Heliocentric Julian Date of midobservation (minus 2,450,000 days), (2) the Johnson R magnitude
and (3) its error.

3. Light Curves

Almost all of the observed data were folded by the period listed in the General Catalogue
of Variable Stars (Kholopov 1985). For the stars SS CVn and AX Leo, the period from Maintz
(2005) was used, for UZ CVn the period from Vandenbroere & Berthold (2001) was used, and for
IO Lyr and AN Ser, the period from Le Borgne et al. (2007) was used. These periods yielded light
curves in which our 2006 data and 2008 R-band data were more closely aligned in phase space. As
suggested by previous investigators, all twenty-one stars pulsate in the fundamental mode, and the
stars AB UMa, RV UMa, and SS CVn, exhibit light curve modulation, the so called Blazhko eﬀect.
There are other cases of stars with noticeable light curve scatter, namely UY Boo, AX Leo, and BT
Dra. UY Boo has been shown by Le Borgne et al. (2007) to have irregular slow variations, and AX

– 6 –

Leo has been reported by Schmidt (2002) to show noticeable light curve scatter. Piersimoni et al.
(1993) found that BT Dra has a bump that precedes the light minimum, and possibly, a hump on
the rising branch. We see light curve scatter at maximum and minimum light but no hump on the
rising branch for BT Dra.

The estimated intensity mean R-band magnitude and pulsation amplitudes for each star from
the observed data is found from a Fourier decomposition of the light curve. The order of the Fourier
ﬁt (from a 4th- to 8th-order) did not change the computed mean magnitude of the star. However,
variations of the amplitude, on the order of ∼0.01 mag, occurred depending on the order of the ﬁt.
The error in the R-band amplitude is hence 0.01 mag. These values are presented in Table 2 along
with the number of observed data points for each star, Nobs, and the order of the Fourier ﬁt used
to determine the amplitude. For the stars exhibiting scatter in their light curves due to the i.e.,
the Blazhko eﬀect, a narrow range of HJD is used in determining the stars R-band magnitude and
amplitude. For these cases, the limited HJD range shows no detectable scatter in the light curve,
yet there is ample data for an accurate Fourier ﬁt. Individual light curves for two representative
stars, one Blazhko star and one normal star, are seen in Figures 1-2.

Corresponding V -band light curves from the literature are found for the program stars. This is
so that the (V−R) at minimum V -band light, (V−R)min, can be calculated for each of the program
stars. An analysis on the use of (V − R)min for reddening determination can thus be carried out.

Almost half of the corresponding V -band light curves in our sample are obtained from the All
Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) database (Pojmanski 2002). The ASAS data used covers a range
of observations from 2001-2009 and for each measurement, ﬁve V -band magnitude values are given
which correspond to ﬁve diﬀerent aperture sizes used in the photometry. The time series, V (t),
was generated by weighting the average of the magnitude values given for the ﬁve apertures as
described by Kov´acs (2005). The corresponding V -band data for our program stars is mentioned
in the individual notes for each RR Lyrae star.

The V and R light curves were ﬁt with a series of six RR Lyrae light curve templates as
described in Layden et al. (1996) to ﬁnd where maximum light occurs and align it with phi=0. For
stars with noticeable light curve scatter (that was not due to the Blazhko eﬀect), the light curve
was separated into diﬀerent diﬀerent observing seasons, which usually corresponded to diﬀerent
light curve “branches”. The period for each of these “branches” was solved for, and again aligned
with phi=0. Hence, the phase-shift is treated as a free parameter. Since color and reddening is not
related to the long-term period stability, this is an acceptable way to reduce light curve scatter,
especially when combining photometry from widely diﬀering years.

4. Comments on Individual Stars

O-C curves are widely used for investigating the period behavior of variable stars. The O-C
value refers to observed - calculated: the diﬀerence between the observed and calculated epoch of

– 7 –

a light curve.

The GEOS RR Lyr Survey (Le Borgne et al. 2007), contains ∼50000 times of maximum light
from more than 3000 RR Lyr stars obtained either visually or with electronic devices or photo-
graphically. From these measurements, O-C curves are made.

UY Boo This star has an O-C curve that changes by ∼4 days from approximately HJD
2,420,000 to 2,450,000 days. Le Borgne et al. (2007) shows that UY Boo exhibits irregular slow
variation. We notice extreme light-curve scatter in the R-band data. To ﬁnd its photometric prop-
erties, we use the UY Boo data with the HJD range indicated in Table 2. The V -band taken for
this star is taken from ASAS. To ﬁnd (V − R)min, separate results are presented for the 2006 and
2008 data to describe the star’s behaviour at these distinct points in its irregular variation.

TV CrB This star is shown to have a well-deﬁned linearly increasing period (Le Borgne et al.
2007). It has an O-C curve that changes in a relatively linear manner by ∼0.2 days from approxi-
mately HJD 2,410,000 to 2,450,000 days. We see no light curve scatter in the R-band between the
2006 and 2008 data. The V -band data is taken from both the Behlen Survey and Layden et al. (in
preparation).

SS CVn This star exhibts the Blazhko eﬀect with a Blazhko period of 97 days (Wils, Lloyd, &
Bernhard 2006). Similarly, we ﬁnd that the 2006 and 2008 R-band data do not match up well with
each other. As their is no V -band data with approximately the same HJD range as the R-band
data in the literature, no (V − R)min was found for this star.

UZ CVn This star has an O-C curve that is shown to be represented either by an abrupt
period change around epoch 28000 or by a parabolic ﬁt (Vandenbroere & Berthold 2001). From
approximately HJD 2,430,000 to 2,450,000 days, the O-C curve changes by ∼0.4 days. We see no
evidence of light curve variation in our 2006 and 2008 data. The R-band data used is from the
Behlen Survey combined with the new observations presented in this paper. The V -band is taken
from Behlen Variable Star Survey. We ﬁnd that the period given by Vandenbroere & Berthold
(2001), 0.69779191 days, yields not only a more tightly phased light curve in the Behlen data, but
also results in a better ﬁt between the R-band Behlen data and the data presented here.

BC Dra The V -band photometry is taken from Szabados & Stobie (1982), Szabados & Stobie

(1982), with a mean V error of 0.036 mag.

BT Dra This star has an O-C curve with a roughly linear trend in decreasing O-C, with a
0.1 day variation from approximately HJD 2,420,000 to 2,450,000 days. The V -band data is taken
from Piersimoni et al. (1993) who note that the light curve of BT Dra has a bump that precedes
minimum light, and possibly, a bump on the rising branch. We ﬁnd scatter in the R-band data of
∼0.05 mag at maximum and minimum light. This is not seen for the rest of the light curve.

SW Dra This star has a signiﬁcant phase-lag between light and radial velocity curves, and its
O-C curve shows a gradual increase from approximately HJD 2,440,000 to 2,455,000 days. The
V -band data is taken from both Sti¸epe´n (1972) and Jones et al. (1987). Due to few bright stars in

– 8 –

its vicinity, only one comparison star was suitable to use for the R-band light curve.

CW Her This stars’ O-C curve changes by ∼0.2 days from approximately HJD 2,440,000 to

2,450,000 days. The V -band light curve is taken from the Behlen Variable Star Survey.

VZ Her This star changes its period (Szeidl, Olah & Mizser 1986). This V -band data is from

Fitch, Wisniewski, & Johnson (1966) and Sturch (1966).

AX Leo This star shows noticeable light curve scatter (Schmidt 2002). From our R-band
observations we ﬁnd a 0.03 mag discrepancy at some points in the light curve between the 2006
and 2008 data. The V - and R-band light curve is taken from the Behlen Survey and only data
from 1990 is used. The data from the Behlen Survey taken after 1990 is too sparse to accurately
determine its’ properties.

FN Lyr This star has the largest E(B-V) value in the sample, and hence it is the most uncertain.

This star was not used in the calibration of (V − R)min,0.

IO Lyr The V -band data from Sti¸epe´n (1972) and Sturch (1966) has sparse phase coverage at
minimum light (2 data points). Hence this data is combined with the V -band data from Layden et
al. (in preparation). No signiﬁcant diﬀerence in (V − R)min is found when using only the Sti¸epe´n
(1972) and Sturch (1966) data, or when using the Layden et al. (in preparation) data.

AN Ser The V -band light curve is taken from ASAS. The V -band photometry taken by Lub
(1977) and transformed to Johnson V agrees very well with the more current ASAS photometry,
although they are taken more than almost 40 years apart.

AT Ser This star has an O-C curve that changes by ∼−0.6 days from approximately HJD
2,418,000 to 2,455,000 days. It then seems to hover around zero. There is no noticeable light curve
discrepancies between the 2006 and 2008 R-band data. The V -band is taken from ASAS Project.

AW Ser The V -band data from ASAS project has a lot of scatter, especially at minimum
light. This could be due to its relatively faint magnitude. Its O-C curve has only 9 points, but does
show a change by ∼ 0.2 days from approximately HJD 2,448,000 to 2,455,000 days. We do not see
any diﬀerence in the R-band 2006 and 2008 data. The data from Layden et al. (in preparation),
corresponds very well with the ASAS data, but shows signiﬁcantly less light curve scatter. Hence,
the Layden data is used.

AB UMa This star exhibits the Blazhko eﬀect, and hence there is a signiﬁcant discrepancy in
the R-band 2006 and 2008 light curve data. In the determination of (V − R)min, both the V - and R-
band data from the Behlen Survey is used, which is taken simultaneously, to avoid inconsistencies in
the light curve due to diﬀerent cycles in the Blazhko light curve. Two separate results are presented
to describe the star’s behaviour at these distinct points in its Blazhko phase.

RV UMa This star exhibts the Blazhko eﬀect with a Blazhko period of 93 days (Wils et al.
2006). A thorough light curve analysis of RV UMa by Hurta et al. (2008) reveals the quintuplet
frequency solution of this star. The R-band data shows clearly a discrepancy in the 2006 and 2008

– 9 –

data. No V -band data with the same HJD range as that of the R-band was found, and so no
(V − R)min was found for this star.

AT Vir This star is shown to have a linearly decreasing period (Le Borgne et al. 2007). It shows
a parabolic shape in its O-C diagram, varying by −0.4 days from approximately HJD 2,420,000 to
2,450,000 days. We do not ﬁnd any R-band light curve scatter between the 2006 and 2008 data,
although admittedly, there in not a wealth of R-band data for this star. The V -band is taken from
ASAS Project.

AV Vir The V -band light curve is taken from the ASAS Project.

ST Vir Le Borgne et al. (2007) ﬁnd that the O-C pattern for this star shows evidence for
several changes in the direction of the period variation. We do not see any scatter in our 2006 and
2008 R-band data. The V -band data is taken from both the ASAS Project.

5. Reddening Calibration

The apparent (V − R) colors of the program stars are found at minimum V -band light by (1)
performing a Fourier decomposition on the V - and R-band light curves and ﬁnding the minimum
(V − R) at minimum V -band light, (V − R)F
min, and (2) ﬁnding the average color for phases between
0.5 and 0.8, (V − R)φ(0.5−0.8)
. Kunder et al. (2008) noticed a slight correlation between amplitude
and (V − R)φ(0.5−0.8)
min, a Fourier decomposition is performed which
requires a relatively complete light curve, especially at minimum light. We investigate these two
methods further to asses how well the apparent (V − R) colors of RR Lyrae stars can be used to
ﬁnd the interstellar reddening along the line of sight to the star.

. However, to obtain (V − R)F

min,0

When ﬁtting a Fourier decomposition to the V and R-band data, the same ﬁt order for the
R-band listed in Table 2 is used; the ﬁt order for the V -band is given in Table 3. In general, an
8th-order ﬁt was used for both the V - and R-band light curves. The apparent (V − R) color at
minimum V -band light, (V − R)F
min, is dereddened from the reddening values taken from Schlegel,
Finkbeiner & Davis (1998). The adopted E(V − R) values are shown in Table 3, as well as the
computed intrinsic color at minimum V -band light, (V − R)F
min,0 (column 7) and the error in the
error in the color at minimum V -band light, σ(V − R)F
min,0. The V -band amplitudes, as determined
from the V -band Fourier ﬁts, are also shown.

To estimate an error in (V − R)F
min value for our program RR Lyrae stars, various tests are
performed to asses how much (V − R)F
min changes. First, a few points in the V and R light curves
were removed, particularly those points close to minimum V -band light. A Fourier decomposition
was applied again to these modiﬁed light curves, and (V − R)F
min
changed by ∼0.005 mag. This indicates that the determination of (V − R)F
min is largely independent
on the inclusion or exclusion of a few data points in the light curve. This is most likely due to the
fact that most of the light curves presented here are quite complete. There are some stars with not

min is larger for these

Second, diﬀerent ﬁt-orders are employed. In this case, the (V − R)F

min value can change by
∼ 0.02 mag. All ﬁts are examined by eye to see which Fourier ﬁt approximates the light curve
best, especially the ﬁt at minimum V -band light. From these two tests, an error of 0.01 mag in
(V − R)F
min is estimated. Stars with either noisy or sparse light curves have larger adopted errors.
The error in E(V − R) is also about 0.01 mag. Hence, most of the adopted errors in our (V − R)F
min,0
values is 0.01 mag. The error in (V − R)F

min,0 is given in Table 3.

The zero-point error in the R-band light curve inﬂuences both (V −R)F

min and (V −R)φ(0.5−0.8)
.
This varies from star to star, depending mainly on the sigma in the calibrated magnitude of the
comparison stars and the number observations of the comparison star. In general, a comparison
star has a sigma in the calibrated magnitude that is less than 0.021 mag, and most have a smaller
sigma (∼0.012 mag). Also, in general each ﬁeld was observed photometrically 3 or more times
which results in a zero-point error that is 0.010 mag or less. The two RR Lyrae ﬁelds with SW Dra
and AX Leo have only 2 calibration observations, and have slightly larger zero-point uncertainties
of ∼0.018 mag and ∼ 0.011 mag, respectively. The zero-point error is taken into account when
calculating the error in the individual light curve data points presented in Appendix A and when
performing the Fourier decomposition to the light curve.

min

Computing the colors at minimum light via an arithmetic mean of the observed (V − R) data
having phases between 0.5 and 0.8 is relatively straight forward. The mean values, in magnitude
units, their standard errors of the mean, and the number of points at minimum light in the V and
R light curves are reported in the last three columns of Table 3.

Three additional stars not observed in our project are included Table 3 and in our subsequent
analysis. The two stars, AL CMi and GO Hya, have photometry from the Behlen Variable Star
Survey (Schmidt 1991, 1995) and not only have adequate phase coverage for a good estimate of
(V − R)min, but also well known reddening values. The third star not observed in our project is
TZ Aur, and the photometry is taken from Warner (2008).

For three stars observed from our program, (AB UMa, AX Leo, CW Her) photometry from
the Behlen Survey was used exclusively in determining (V − R)min. This is because these stars had
light curves that exhibited light curve variation as a function of Julian Date, and none of these
stars had V -band data with the same HJD as that of the R-band data presented here. The Behlen
Survey data has the advantage that V and R-band are taken simultaneously. The scatter in light
curve due to the intrinsic properties of the star, i.e., Blazhko eﬀect, irregular slow variations, etc.
is exhibited identically the light curves for both passbands. For these stars in which the V - and
R-band light curves were taken simultaneously, an error of 0.01 mag in (V − R)F
min,0 is assigned.
For the star, UZ CVn the R-band data from the Behlen Variable Star Survey is supplemented with
that from this paper. The combined V - and R- band photometry used to determine (V − R)min is
shown for two representative stars in Figures 3 and 4.

– 11 –

When performing a Fourier decomposition on the V - and R-band light curves and ﬁnding the
(V − R) at minimum V -band light, the mean (V − R)F
min,0 is 0.28 ± 0.02 mag, where 0.02 is the
dispersion about the mean. Finding the average (V − R) color for phases between 0.5 and 0.8
results in a mean (V − R)φ(0.5−0.8)
of 0.27 ± 0.02 mag. These results are within the error bars of
each other.

min,0

Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the intrinisic color at minimum V -band light, (V − R)φ(0.5−0.8)
,
as a function of period, [Fe/H] , V -band amplitude and ∆logP. There is not much diﬀerence when
using (V − R)F
min,0. The period shift, ∆logP, is the diﬀerence between the periods of RR Lyrae
variables at ﬁxed amplitude. An RR Lyrae amplitude is usually considered to be a function of
temperature (see Clement & Shelton 1999, Kunder & Chaboyer 2009). This comparison is usually
made between the RR0 Lyrae stars in diﬀerent globular clusters (Sandage 1981; Carney et al. 1992;
Sandage 1993), and is thought to indicate the evolutionary state of an RR Lyrae variable.

min,0

The mean (V − R)φ(0.5−0.8)

is independent or at least very insensitive to metallicity, amplitude

and ∆logP. No trend is seen in a least squares analysis of (V − R)φ(0.5−0.8)
as a function of [Fe/H],
∆logP, period or V -amplitude. Weighted least squares ﬁts led to slopes of +0.02 ± 0.04 mag day−1
(for period), −0.023 ± 0.014 (for V -amplitude), +0.016 ± 0.05 mag dex−1 (for [Fe/H]), and +0.026
± 0.02 mag day−1 (for ∆logP). These results are very similar for (V − R)F
min,0, when ﬁnding the
(V − R) at minimum V -band light from a Fourier decomposition. Weighted least squares ﬁts led
to slopes of +0.07 ± 0.04 mag day−1 (for period), −0.031 ± 0.012 (for V -amplitude), +0.002 ±
0.005 mag dex−1 (for [Fe/H]), and +0.0003 ± 0.06 mag day−1 (for ∆logP).

min,0

The greatest evidence of an (V − R)min,0 dependence is with V -amplitude, where a 2-sigma
slope in the (V−R)min,0 vs V -amplitude plane is found. This is the case for both methods of ﬁnding
minimum light. Although in both cases the slope with V -amplitude is insigniﬁcant, the slope with
(V − R)F
min,0 is larger, in contrast with the ﬁnding of Kunder et al. (2008). The larger sample size
shows that both methods for determining minimum light are independent on V -amplitude.

Of particular interest is the relation of (V − R)min,0 with [Fe/H]. Guldenschuh et al. (2005)
did not ﬁnd a trend with minimum light (V − I) color and [Fe/H], and no trend is seen with this
larger of sample of stars either. It is interesting to note an increase of scatter in (V − R)min,0 in
the more metal-rich stars. This is evident in the Blanco (1992) sample as well, and may be absent
in the (V − I)min,0 sample due to the much smaller sample size.

If we seek a multidimensional ﬁt of (V − R)min,0 with period, [Fe/H] , [Fe/H]2, we obtain

(V −R)φ(0.5−0.8)

min,0

and

with an rms of 0.022 mag and 0.024 mag, respectively. None of these slopes are formally signiﬁcant,
although Blanco (1992) determined E(B−V) using these parameters. That the (V−R)F
min,0 is largely

– 12 –

independent on period, amplitude and [Fe/H] is the same conclusion reached by Kunder et al.
(2008), but the result here is based on 31 RR0 Lyrae stars, as opposed to eleven.

6. Are the Colors of Galactic Bulge RR Lyrae Anomalous?

Stutz, Popowski & Gould (1999) found that the (V − I)0 colors of the bulge RR Lyrae stars
behave in an anomalous way, distinct from the (V − I)0 colors of local stars. For a ﬁxed period, the
Baade’s window RR Lyrae stars are ∼0.17 mag redder in (V − I)0 than the local RR Lyrae stars.
Popowski (2000) showed that part of these oﬀsets were due to errors in the original photometry
used. The other part, however, is unclear and various attempts to explain such an oﬀset is reviewed
by Popowski (2000). Paczy´nski & Stanek (1998) and Stutz et al. (1999) explain this oﬀset in terms
of a diﬀerence between the intrinsic properties of the Red Clump and RR Lyrae stars in the two
populations. Popowski (2000) noted that a non-standard interstellar extinction of RV = 2.1, rather
than the standard value of 2.5, would cause the (V − I)0 discrepancy between bulge and local RR
Lyrae disappear.

Recently, Collinge et al. (2006) found a discrepancy of 0.05 mag between the mean value of
(V − I)min,0 in the OGLE RR Lyrae sample in the Galactic bulge and in the ﬁeld RR0 Lyrae value
obtained by Guldenschuh et al. (2005). The reddening values used in determining OGLE RR Lyrae
(V − I)min,0 was taken from the reddening map from Sumi (2004), which in turn uses the observed
color of the red clump (RC) giants as a measure of reddening. There are three possible causes for
this discrepancy.

(1) The E(V−I) values reported by Sumi (2004) are 0.05-0.08 mag too large, most likely caused
by a discrepancy between the RR Lyrae-to-red clump color diﬀerential of the bulge population
(measured from the OGLE data) and that of the local population.
(2) The Guldenschuh et al. (2005) result is calibrated incorrectly by 0.05-0.08 mag. Their result is
based on 16 calibrating stars.
(3) The intrinsic colors or RR Lyrae at minimum light are a function of environment. If this were
the case, there should be signiﬁcant doubts on the validity of using RR Lyrae stars as distance
indicators. The suggestion of an RR Lyrae intrinsic color discrepancy between the bulge and
the local region of the Galaxy has been made before (Stutz et al. 1999; Popowski 2000). An age
discrepancy between RR Lyrae in the Bulge and in the ﬁeld could perhaps be the source of such
an intrinsic color discrepancy, such as seen in the red clump stars (Udalski 1998; Girardi & Salaris
2001). It may be that population eﬀects are more important for the red clump than for the RR
Lyrae, but further studies of local RR Lyrae colors are needed before this can become a strong
statement.

We take a thorough look at this possibility,

if the intrinsic colors or RR Lyrae at min-
imum light are a function of environment. The RR0 Lyrae stars from the MACHO Project

– 13 –

(Kunder & Chaboyer 2008) are used for this purpose. As the MACHO light curves have a wealth of
data points and good phase coverage, the (V − R) at minimum light V -band light from the Fourier
decomposition is used to ﬁnd (V − R)min.

In the bottom panel of Figure 7, the average (V−R) color at minimum V -band light, (V−R)F

min
of each MACHO ﬁeld is plotted as a function of b. The middle panel shows the average color excess
as determined by Popowski, Cook & Becker (2003) (hereafter P03), E(V − R)P03, as a function of
Galactic b. The P03 color excess values are based on the mean colors of stars from the MACHO
survey toward the Galactic bulge, < V − R >, in 4′ x 4′ regions of the sky. They show that
< V − R > can be converted to extinction and visual extinction for 9717 elements at a resolution
of about 4′ is determined. The conversion from the P03 < V − R > to E(V − R)P03 used here is
based on an exponential dusty disk model of the Galactic disk which is shown to correspond well
with the AV reddening map from Stanek (1996). This in contrast to using the conversion based
on Dutra et al. (2003) reddening map, derived from Two Micron All Sky Survey data in the J, H,
and K bands. The Stanek (1996) reddening map is not only in a passband that does not require
additional conversions for the purposes used for here, but also has a zero point that has been
accurately measured with two independent types of stars (Alcock et al. 1998, Gould, Popowski &
Turndrup 1998).

min,0 as a function of b. There is a clear trend between (V − R)F

The top panel of Figure 7 shows the intrinsic (V − R) color at minimum V -band light, (V −
R)F
min,0 and Galactic b, with a
slope of 0.008 ± 0.0008 mag/◦. This plot illustrates the diﬃculty of making an accurate analysis
using stars in the Bulge. Kunder & Chaboyer (2008) use 2435 RR0 Lyrae stars from the MACHO
Galactic bulge ﬁelds to investigate the structure of the Galactic bulge. They ﬁnd no signiﬁcant
trends with metallicity, period or amplitude as a function of position. Hence, there is no physical
reason why (V − R)F

min,0 would be a function Galactic b.

The chances of an RR Lyrae being blended increases closer to the Galactic plane, but this does
not appear to be a contributing factor in the (V − R)F
min,0 - Galactic b trend. Poposwki et al. (2005)
found evidence for blending for 1 event out of 53, (∼ 2%) at b > −4 in an analysis of MACHO
red clump stars to determine to what degree the clump microlensing events are blended. As clump
giants have an average absolute V magnitude that is ∼0.5 mag fainter than RR Lyrae stars, we
would expect blending to be even less of a problem for the RR Lyrae.

The P03 reddening values are based on the CMD of 4′ x 4′ regions of the sky. However, it is now
known that there is a change in the CMD toward the plane. From ∼700 giant stars, Zoccali et al.
(2008) found that there is a metallicity gradient of −0.25 dex from b = −12◦ to b = −4◦. Using
isochrones, we ﬁnd that a 0.25 dex change in metallicity corresponds to a change in color on the
RGB of 0.06 mag. The average diﬀerence in E(V − R) between the RR Lyrae and P03 from b =
−10◦ to b = −4◦ is ∼−0.04 mag, and extrapolating this result to cover b = −12◦ to b = −4◦, the
diﬀerence in color excess is −0.053 mag.

The individual RR Lyrae (V − R)F

min,0 values are over-plotted in the top and bottom panels

– 14 –

Figure 7. It is clear that the dispersion in the RR Lyrae colors increases closer to the Galactic plane
(lower |b| values). The closer to the plane, the larger the diﬀerential reddening in one of the P03 4′
x 4′ area. Since the individual RR Lyrae fall at random places within each of P03 reddening map
pixel, it is expected that the dispersion of the individual RR Lyrae (top and bottom panels) would
increase. As blended RR Lyrae would appear redder, this would also explain why there are some
ultra-blue RR Lyrae as well as very red ones. We hence caution the reader that the P03 reddenings
have a Galactic b dependence and can underestimate the amount of color excess, E(V − R), in low
Galactic b regions by ∼0.04 mag.

Baade’s window centered is roughly on the globular cluster NGC 6522 at (l, b) = (1.◦0, −3.◦9)
and is a region known to have relatively low amounts of interstellar extinction. We turn our analysis
to this region. In the top plot of Figure 8, the 53 RR0 Lyrae stars in Baade’s Window are shown
as a function of Galactic b. The histogram of (V − R)min,0 values are shown in the bottom plot.
The median of the distribution is 0.28 identical to that of the (V − R)min,0 found by the local RR
Lyrae stars. Their average (V − R)min,0 is 0.288 mag, and the mode is 0.27 mag.

There are 17 RR0 Lyrae stars in Baade’s Window that have OGLE (V − I)min,0 values from
Collinge et al. (2006) that can be matched with a MACHO RR0 Lyrae star. In Figure 9 these stars
are shown as a function of Galactic b. The dotted line indicates the local RR Lyrae (V − R)min,0
and (V − I)min,0 value, from the (V − R)min,0 found above and from the Guldenschuh et al. (2005)
value, respectively. The Bulge RR0 Lyrae (V − R)min,0 values are similar to the local RR0 Lyrae
value. This is not the case for the intrinsic Bulge RR Lyrae minimum light colors and local RR
Lyrae (V − I)min,0 colors.

From the above analysis, the (V − R)min,0 colors of the bulge RR Lyrae stars behave in a
similar manner as local stars. Therefore we ﬁnd it is unlikely that the (V − I)min,0 colors of the
bulge RR Lyrae behave in an anomalous way from the local RR Lyrae stars. This indicates that
there either is a problem with the zero-point accuracy of the Sumi (2004) reddening map, or with
the Guldenschuh et al. (2005) (V − I)min,0 calibration. Given the diﬃculty of determing reddening
in the Galactic bulge, we argue the most likely cause of this is a RR Lyrae-to-red clump color
diﬀerential of the bulge population (measured from the OGLE data). Since we ﬁnd the Bulge
RR Lyrae stars do not exhibit anomalous colors, the most likely explanation seems to be the
inﬂuence of metallicity on the color of the red clump. Unfortunately, systematic errors in the
OGLE photometry may appear at approximately the level as the 0.05 mag discrepancy between
the mean value of (V − I)min,0 in the OGLE Bulge and the local RR Lyrae sample Collinge et al.
(2006). Hence, the dependence of the color of the red clump on metallicity is complicated and
would require a thorough look at the OGLE photometry, which is beyond the scope of this paper.

7. Conclusion

New R-band photometry for 21 local RR0 Lyrae stars is presented. The R-band light curves
have between 65 - 145 data points per star. Seventeen of these light curves are combined with
V -band light curves from the literature, and the (V − R) color at minimum light is found. Fourteen
additional stars from the literature are added to our sample.

min

Two deﬁnitions of (V − R)min are explored. (V − R)F

min is deﬁned as the minimum light color at
minimum V -band light found by performing a Fourier decomposition to the V and R light curves.
(V − R)φ(0.5−0.8)
is deﬁned as the average color over the phase range 0.5-0.8. As our program stars
have well known reddening values, the (V − R)min colors are dereddened. The average dereddened
color at minimum V -band light, (V − R)F
min,0, is 0.28 ± 0.02, where 0.02 is the dispersion about
the mean. The average dereddened color over the phase range 0.5-0.8, (V − R)φ(0.5−0.8)
, is 0.27 ±
0.02. These values are based on a total sample of 31 stars, and do not appear to depend on [Fe/H] ,
period, V -amplitude, or ∆logP. The [Fe/H] range of our program stars spans [Fe/H] = 0 dex to
[Fe/H] = −2.5 dex, the period range spans P = 0.38 days to P=0.78 days, and the V -amplitude
range spans AV = 0.39 mag to AV = 1.35 mag. Previous hints of V -amplitude dependence on
(V − R)φ(0.5−0.8)

seem dispelled with the larger sample size.

Using the MACHO Bulge RR0 Lyrae stars from Kunder & Chaboyer (2008), we investigate if
the Bulge RR0 Lyrae stars have anomalous colors as compared to the local RR Lyrae stars. The
Bulge RR Lyrae stars are dereddened using the Popowski et al. (2003) reddening map. The RR0
Lyrae stars in Baade’s Window have approximately the same intrinsic (V − R)min as the local
sample. Hence the (V − R)min,0 colors of the bulge RR Lyrae stars behave in the same way as
the (V − R)min,0 colors of local stars. Given previous suggestions of anomalous bulge RR Lyrae
colors and the wide use of RR Lyrae variables as distance indicators, such a convergence of results
is particularly appreciated.
