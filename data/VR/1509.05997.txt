The Outer Galactic Halo As Probed By RR Lyr Stars
From the Palomar Transient Facility + Keck1

Judith Cohen2, Branimir Sesar3, Sophianna Banholzer2, the PTF Collaboration2

ABSTRACT

We present initial results from our study of the outer halo of the Milky Way
using a large sample of RR Lyr(ab) variables datamined from the archives of the
Palomar Transient Facility. Of the 464 RR Lyr in our sample with distances
exceeding 50 kpc, 62 have been observed spectroscopically at the Keck Observa-
tory. vr and σ(vr) are given as a function of distance between 50 and 110 kpc,
and a very preliminary rather low total mass for the Milky Way out to 110 kpc
of ∼ 7±1.5×1011 M⊙ is derived from our data.

Introduction

We present initial results from our study of the outer halo of the Milky Way (MW)
using a large sample of RR Lyr(ab) variables datamined for the archives of the Palomar
Transient Facility (PTF) (Law et al, 2009, Rau et al 2009) (P.I. S. R. Kulkarni of Caltech).
RR Lyr are old low-mass pulsating stars with distinctive light curves, amplitudes at V
of ∼ 1 mag, and periods of ∼0.5 days. These characteristics makes them fairly easy to
distinguish in a wide ﬁeld, multi-epoch optical imaging survey of moderate duration if the
survey cadence is suitable. Their most desirable characteristic is that they can be used as
standard candles. Accurate luminosities, which have only a small metallicity dependence,
can be inferred directly from the light curves, and these stars, with MV ∼ +0.6 mag, are
fairly luminous and hence can be detected at large distances.

the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.

Using machine learning techniques we have isolated a sample of 464 RR Lyr from the
PTF. These were found by searching for PTF ﬁelds which had enough epochs of observation
(25 minimum) in the R ﬁlter. A total of roughly 10,000 deg2 on the sky met this requirement
and was searched. The regions of known outer halo objects (i.e. dwarf galaxies, globular
clusters, and known halo streams) were excluded. The search criterion was variability, and
the sample was reﬁned by requiring the derived period and amplitude to have values appro-
priate for RR Lyr. Since no observing time was assigned for this purpose, we are eﬀectively
datamining the PTF archive, and our sample lies in random pencil beams through the halo,
each a PTF tile (area on sky: 7.6 deg2).

Our sample begins at a brightness corresponding to a distance of 50 kpc, and extends
out to ∼110 kpc, after which RR Lyr are too faint to pick out with PTF data. The selection
procedure was carried out in 2012; at present the PTF+iPTF variable star database contains
photometry through Dec 2014, i.e. two more years of data, none of which was used to select
the current sample. A more detailed description of the search method is given in Sesar et al
(2014). Given this is a variability search, the only contaminants with colors similar to those
of RR Lyr are quasars (QSOs).

Fig. 1 (top) shows the light curve of one of the brighter RR Lyr in our sample (r =
55 kpc) as well as that of one of the most distant RR Lyr found to date (r = 102 kpc)
(bottom).

addition of 2 years of data to the PTF variable star database in early 2015, this star had only
61 detections at R in the PTF database. The color scheme denotes the year of observation,
with the ﬁrst day set to the ﬁrst night the object was observed by the PTF. Black = year
1, red = year 2, green = year 3, blue = year 4, etc using the PGPLOT color routine. The
sample selection was carried out using only the ﬁrst two years of PTF data.

2. Radial Velocity Measurements

A spectroscopic campaign to obtain radial velocities for RR Lyr candidates began at
the Keck Observatory with the Deimos spectrograph (Faber et al 2003) in the spring of
2014. RR Lyr are pulsating variable stars, hence their observed radial velocities need to be
corrected for the motion of the atmosphere. To measure the center-of-mass velocity vr of RR
Lyr stars, we use the Balmer Hα line and the method described by Sesar (2012). Typical
uncertainties in center-of-mass velocities, including both observational and phase correction,
are 15 to 20 km/s for a single Deimos spectrum.

Fig. 2 shows vr vs r for the 62 RR Lyr with Keck/Deimos spectra. We cut the sample
at 85 kpc, and assume an uncertainty in each individual measurement of 20 km/s. We ﬁnd a
mean vr for the inner 41 RR Lyr of −1 km/s with σ = 116 km/s, while for the outer 21 stars,
the mean is +13 km/s with σ(vr) = 91 km/s. The mean of vr falls close to 0, suggesting
that our corrections to observed radial velocities are appropriate.

When 4 major outliers (2 high and 2 low) are deleted from the inner sample, σ falls to
90 km/s for the inner sample. Deleting three high outliers from the outer sample leaves 18
R Lyr beyond 85 kpc, and σ falls to 57 km/s, a remarkably low dispersion. We are not yet
certain whether the outliers arise from substructures within the outer halo.

The velocity dispersion as a function of radius for the Milky Way halo is shown in Fig. 3,
where we compare our work to selected values from the recent literature. The small stars
denote our entire sample, cut at 85 kpc, and the larger stars show our sample of outer halo
RR Lyr cleaned of outliers; recall that the outliers comprise only about 10% of our total
sample. The star symbols are plotted at the median distance of the inner and of the outer
sample. The velocity dispersions found for the inner halo from recent studies are also shown:
from SDSS blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars (Xue et al 2004), from SDSS K giants (Xue
et al 2014) as well as a sample of halo high velocity stars from Brown et al (2010). Most of
these other samples are conﬁned to distances less than 80 kpc. The only attempt to reach
the distances probed by the outer part of our sample is that of Deason et al (2012). Our
results agree quite well with the value they published of σ(vr) of 50 to 60 km/s at distances
of ∼110 kpc, rising to ∼90 km/s at distances of 70 kpc. We agree reasonably well with the
result of Brown et al (2010) for σ(vr) as a function of r from the MMT high velocity star
survey, extending out to 75 kpc, when their non-parametric method to eliminate outliers is
used (see their Fig. 6).

Fig. 2.— Radial velocities as a function of heliocentric distances are shown for our sample
of 62 RR Lyr selected from the PTF with Keck/Deimos moderate resolution spectra. The
borders of the regions (both high and low vr) considered outliers are indicated by the dashed
horizontal lines. The text at the bottom right gives the number of RR Lyr, mean and σ
(with 20 km/s removed in quadrature for observational uncertainties) for the inner and for
the outer sample, cut at 85 kpc, as well as these with the largest outliers removed (3 stars for
the outer region, and 4 for the closer sample). Filled circles denote stars with two Deimos
spectra, open circles have only one spectrum. One σ error bars are shown for each RR
Lyr. The two large stars denote the means for the inner and outer sample with the outliers
removed; their two error bars correspond to σ for the full sample, and that for the cropped
sample.

Fig. 3.— σ(vr) is shown as a function of log(r) for our inner and outer sample of RR Lyr (split
at 85 kpc), with and without eliminating the single strong outliers. Values from Xue et al
(2008), whose extrapolation to larger r is indicated by a dashed line, Xue et al (2011, 2014),
Brown, Geller & Kenyon (2014), and Deason et al (2012b), are shown. The text within the
ﬁgure indicates the colors used for each reference and the nature of the sample in each case.

Implications

One of our goals is to determine the radial distribution of the outer halo of the Milky
Way using RR Lyrae as tracers of its stellar population, and to use this information to derive
the total mass of the MW. We calculate distances assuming a ﬁxed MR of +0.6 mag as the
ﬂux-averaged mean over the period, then correct for interstellar reddening assuming that
the variable is so distant that the full reddening from the maps of Schlegel, Finkbeiner &
Davis (1998) applies.

Fig. 4 shows a histogram of the full sample of 464 candidate RR Lyr beyond 50 kpc as
a function of log(r), where r is the heliocentric distance. Both axes have logarithmic scales.
The vertical axis is the number of variables in bins equally spaced in distance starting at
50 kpc, with 2.8 kpc/bin. These counts, accumulated over a solid angle on the sky of
Ω ∼ 10, 000 deg2, represent ρ(r) (Ω/4π) 4πr2∆r. We ﬁt a power law ρ ∝ r−γ, over the
range of r we cover, i.e. out to just over 100 kpc. Therefore a linear ﬁt of the log(counts) vs
log(RGC) will yield a slope that is −γ + 2. Our best ﬁt slope is γ = 3.8 ± 0.3.

The completeness corrections are very diﬃcult to calculate because the number of epochs
observed varies greatly among the PTF ﬁelds, depending on which (other) project requested
observations of the ﬁeld; the galactic halo project has until recently been allocated no P48
imaging time at all; we have simply used observations acquired for other PTF subprojects
and thus have no control over the cadence of observing nor the ﬁelds observed. Furthermore,
PTF observations at the P48 are carried out as long as the dome can safely remain open
irrespective of clouds. Thus the limiting magnitude of each exposure of a given ﬁeld has a very
wide range, with clouds (i.e. a bright limiting magnitude) more common than exceptional
nights which are perfectly clear and with good seeing, which have the faintest limiting
magnitudes. An RR Lyr at 100 kpc has a mean R of 20.6, close to the limit of the PTF
survey, so that in many PTF images it will not be detected. To aquire a speciﬁed minimum
number N of R detections, where N is set by our search procedure to identify a candidate
RR Lyr, will thus require many more epochs of observation with PTF of its ﬁeld than would
be the case for a RR Lyr at 50 kpc in the same ﬁeld. We indicate our best guess of a lower
limit to the completeness correction arising from this issue at 100 kpc by the vertical arrow
in Fig. 4. Other such issues will further increase the completeness correction above 90 kpc.

The only eﬀort that reaches out to the radial range covered by our RR Lyr sample is
that of Deason et al (2014), who claim there is a very steep outer halo proﬁle, with γ ∼ 6
beyond r = 50 kpc and even steeper slopes γ ∼ 6 − 10 at larger radii. Their sample of ∼5200
stars is contaminated by QSOs; a photometric separation is not suﬃcient and cuts out many
BHB stars.

Fig. 4.— The number density of RR Lyr as a function of distance is shown together with
several power law ﬁts which suggest γ ≈ 3.8. A lower limit to the incompleteness correction
at a distance of 100 kpc is shown as a vertical arrow.

– 8 –

We cannot reproduce the extremely steep decline in n(r) that they claim to observe.
We believe that with our RR Lyr sample selected through variability, the precise distances
we obtain for our RR Lyr stars, and our low QSO contamination, that our result that
ρ ∝ r−3.8±0.3 for 50 < r < 100 kpc is correct. Most other recent analyses, i.e. Xue et al
(2015), Brown et al 2010, ﬁnd γ between 3.5 and 4.5 from r = 20 kpc out to the limit of
their data, between 60 and 80 kpc; see e.g. Fig. 1 of Gnedin et al (2010).

As a rough indication of the total mass of the MW, we assume a spherical halo, ignoring
the subtleties in the inner part of the MW of the thick and thin disk. We also ignore the
diﬀerence between our heliocentric distances and galactocentric distances. The standard way
to obtain the total enclosed mass given a set of tracers, be they globular clusters or RR Lyr
or any other low mass objects in the outer halo of a massive galaxy, is to solve the Jeans
equation. Watkins, Evan & An (2010) have solved the Jeans equation for the case of set of
mass tracers with both distances (not projected distances) and radial velocities located in
the outer halo of a massive galaxy such as the Milky Way. To accomplish this they assume
that the tracers follow a power-law density distribution ρ ∝ r−γ. They further assume that
a NFW halo (Navarro, Frenk & White 1996) is an adequate representation of the outer part
of the Milky Way halo.

Their result then simpliﬁes (see Evans, An, & Deason 2011) to

Lacking proper motions, we cannot evaluate the velocity anisotropy β; we assume
isotropic orbits (β = 0) for the outer halo RR Lyr. Attempts to measure β in the inner
halo are more successful as much larger samples of tracers can be assembled, usually SDSS
BHB stars. Kaﬂe et al (2012), among others, suggest β = +0.5 from ∼25 kpc out to the limit
of their sample at ∼60 kpc, a value similar to that deduced by Williams & Evans (2015),
who apply a new theoretical analysis to previously published data, while Deason et al (2011)
suggest from CDM simulations that β = 0.

Using the above formula with β = 0.0 we ﬁnd a total mass out to 110 kpc of ∼
7±1.5×1011 M⊙, where the uncertainty corresponds to a range in β from −0.5 to +0.5.
This suggests a rather low total mass for the MW, but is in reasonable agreement with sev-
eral recent determinations based on studying halo stars at smaller radii (see the compiled
recent measurements in Fig. 5 of Williams & Evans 2015), although analyses including the
outermost MW satellites and M31 timing arguements continue to suggest a higher total
mass.

Future work should expand our sample of outer halo RR Lyr signiﬁcantly. Another
two years of PTF imaging (2012–2014) has recently been added to the PTF variable star
database, suggesting it is time to conduct another search for candidate RR Lyr in the
PTF+iPTF database, which is a rather daunting task given the limited available human
resources.
