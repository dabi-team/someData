C∗- Actions on Stein analytic spaces with isolated

Introduction

Let V be an irreducible complex analytic space of dimension two with normal singularities
and ϕ : C∗

V a holomorphic action of the group C∗ on V . Denote by

V

ϕ the

foliation on V induced by ϕ. The leaves of this foliation are the one-dimensional orbits of
V for the C∗-action, i.e.

ϕ. We will assume that there exists a dicritical singularity p

only at p. The closure of such a local leaf is an invariant local analytic curve called a

separatrix of
ϕ through p. In [14] Orlik and Wagreich studied the 2-dimensional aﬃne
algebraic varieties embedded in Cn+1, with an isolated singularity at the origin, that are

invariant by an eﬀective action of the form σQ(t, (z0, ..., zn)) = (tq0z0, ..., tqnzn) where
Nn+1, i.e. all qi are positive integers. Such actions are called good
Q = (q0, ..., qn)
actions. In particular they classiﬁed the algebraic surfaces embedded in C3 endowed with
such an action. It is easy to see that any good action on a surface embedded in Cn+1
Cn+1. Conversely, it is the purpose of this paper to
has a dicritical singularity at 0
show that good actions are the models for analytic C∗-actions on Stein analytic spaces

of dimension two with a dicritical singularity. In this paper all spaces are connected and

complex analytic.

Theorem 1. Let V be a normal Stein analytic space of dimension two and ϕ a C∗-action

Notice that this theorem implies that there is no other singularity of ϕ apart from

V . The above theorem can be considered as a GAGA principle for Stein varieties
with C∗-actions. This answers a question posed by some authors (see for instance the

comments after Proposition 1.1.3 in [14] and references there).

Corollary 1. Let V be a smooth Stein surface endowed with a C∗-action having a dicritical

singularity at p

∈

V . Then V is biholomorphic to C2.

The proof of Theorem 1 will also provide a proof of the following:

Theorem 2. The moduli space of pairs (V, ϕ), dim(V ) = 2, with at least one dicritical

singularity for ϕ as in Theorem 1, is the following data

1. A Riemann surface σ0 of genus g and s-points r1, r2, . . . , rs on σ0 considered up to

the automorphism group of σ0.

Conversely, 1 , 2 and 3 imply the existence of a pair (V, ϕ).

The proof of Theorem 1 consists of the following steps. We ﬁrst analize in

of a theorem proved in [14]. It turns out that there is only one element σ0 of arbitrary
V on which C∗ acts transversely. All other

2 Resolution of singularities

In order to prove Theorem 1 we ﬁrst describe the resolution of the action ϕ and then

compare it with the resolution of a model good action.

2.1 Holomorphic foliations

We start with the resolution theorem for normal two dimensional singularities (see [9])

and the resolution theorem for holomorphic foliations (see [17], [5]) that combined together

In order to prove Theorem 3 we need the following index theorem.

if σ is locally (y = 0) and q = 0, this index is equal to µ (quotient of eigenvalues). In the

case of a saddle-node, if σ is equal to (x = 0) and q = 0, this index is zero. At a regular

point q of

the index is zero. The index theorem of [5] asserts that the sum of all the

dicritical component, and the action ˜ϕ is trivial on σ0. The same argument shows that

there cannot be cycles of components of D starting and ending at σ0. Thus the graph

associated to ρ is contractible.

Lemma 1. Suppose that r1, r2, ..., rs are the crossing points at σ0 of the divisor D. Then

the divisor D consists of the union of σ0 and linear chains of Riemann spheres at each of

these crossing points.

Proof. Consider the divisor D at the point r1 renamed as p0. Let σ1 be such that p0 =
σ1. We claim that the C∗-action ˜ϕ on σ1 is nontrivial with a ﬁxed point at p0. Indeed

it can be represented in local coordinates (x, y), where (x = 0) = σ0, (y = 0) = σ1, by

Since the orbits of ψ tend to σ when t tends to zero, pt,x is a holomorphic function in

(C, D). We have also pt,x(0) = 0 because σ is the set of ﬁxed points of ψ. We can

write pt,x(y) as a series

Proposition 1. The variety

action in some aﬃne coordinates.

Proof. Since the self intersection matrix of D0 is negative deﬁnite, by Lemma 6 we have

that D∞ is the support of a divisor Y with positive normal bundle. By [8] Theorem

H 0(X,
X (aY )) for a > 0 big enough. Here
u on X with div(u) + aY > 0. Since C∗ acts on H 0(X,

X (aY ) is the sheaf of meromorphic functions

that Bp contains an open neighborhood of p. This fact will be proved again during the
construction of the conjugacy map between C∗-actions. We aim to construct a conjugacy

between ϕ on Bp and λ on

establishing the following theorem:

Theorem 5. The set Bp is an open subset of V and there is a biholomorphism h : Bp

5 Basins of attraction of dicritical singularities

The main result of this section is the following.

Theorem 6. Let ϕ be a holomorphic action of C∗ on a normal Stein space V of dimension

two. If p

∈

V is a dicritical singularity of

ϕ then the attraction basin of p is V . In other

F

words, every orbit of ϕ on V

p
\ {

}

accumulates on p.

This theorem will follow from the two lemmas below. A C-action is of type C∗ if its

generic orbit is biholomorphic to C∗.

Lemma 8. Let ϕ be a holomorphic C-action of type C∗ on a normal Stein space of

dimension two V . Suppose that the set of ﬁxed points of ϕ is discrete and let p

ϕ. Then the boundary ∂Bp of the basin of attraction Bp

p is a (possibly empty) union of analytic curves, and each one of these curves accumulates

at a nondicritical singularity of ϕ.

Proof. Suppose ∂Bp is nonempty. Then it is invariant by

ϕ, i.e. it is a union of leaves

F

of

ϕ and ﬁxed points of ϕ. We divide the argument in two steps.

F

Step 1: ∂Bp contains no closed leaf.

Proof of Step 1. Suppose that L0

∂Bp is a leaf of

ϕ. Since

ϕ admits a meromorphic

ﬁrst integral, either L0 is closed in V or it accumulates only on singular points. Suppose

that L0 is closed in V then it is an analytic smooth curve in V . Since V is Stein there

Step 2: ∂Bp contains no isolated singularity, thus it is a union of analytic curves. Each

one of these curves contains a nondicritical ﬁxed point of ϕ.

Proof of Step 2. If ∂Bp contains an isolated point P then ∂Bp =

would be compact contradicting the fact that V is Stein. On the other hand, by the ﬁrst

and V = Bp

P

point P of ϕ and since L

∪ {

that L = L

P

∪ {

}

is an analytic curve in V and L accumulates at no other ﬁxed point of

ϕ. Finally, we observe that if a leaf L

⊂

∂Bp accumulates at a ﬁxed point P of ϕ then

this singularity is nondicritical: the basin of attraction of a dicritical singularity in a Stein

variety is open and contains an open neighborhood of the singularity. Since P

∂Bp ,

∈

then some leaf L1

⊂

Bp intersects this neighborhood and therefore L1 accumulates on

both p and P . Such a leaf would be contained in a rational curve in V and this is not

possible because V is Stein. Thus P is nondicritical.

Lemma 9. Let ϕ be a holomorphic C-action of type C∗ with a discrete set of ﬁxed points

on a normal Stein space of dimension two V and an absolutely dicritical singularity at
V . Assume that H 1(Bp, R) = 0 (for instance, if Bp is simply-connected). Then

p

V = Bp.

Proof. Let us ﬁrst prove that V = Bp

∂Bp. Indeed, put A = V

∂Bp and B = Bp .

−

Then A is a connected open subset of V because by Lemma 8, ∂Bp is a thin set and

therefore it does not disconnect V . Since B is also open and connected and ∂A = ∂B it

that Rγ α = 0 yielding a contradiction. Therefore ∂Bp contains no leaf. Thus V = Bp and
the Lemma is proved.

Proof of Theorem 6. Since V is Stein, all regular leaves of

ϕ are biholomorphic to C∗.

F
ϕ has a dicritical singularity,

By Proposition 5 and Theorem 2 of [20] and the fact that

F
ϕ has isolated ﬁxed points.
In view of Lemmas 8 and 9 it is enough to observe that
H 1(Bp, R) = 0. This is clear since the basin Bp of the action ϕ is biholomorphic to the

basin

V

of the linear periodic ﬂow λ on

, and moreover H 1(
V

V

, R) = 0.

Remark 3. The proof of Theorem 6 also shows that V

p
\ {

}

contains no singularity of ϕ

which is dicritical as a singularity of

ϕ.

F

Proof. Suppose by contradiction that q is a dicritical singularity of ϕ then we consider

the attraction basin Bq of q and proceeding as for p we prove that V

∂Bq = Bq. On the

\

other hand, since ∂Bq is a thin set we have that V

∂Bq is connected. Clearly we have

\
because otherwise, since Bq is open, there would be orbits contained in Bp

and Bq, which is not possible because these orbits would be contained in rational curves.

Analogously we have ∂Bq

Therefore, V

∂Bp = V

Bp =

∅

∩
∂Bq, i.e, Bp = Bq and this gives a contradiction.

6 Proof of the main theorems

Proof of Theorem 1. Let us be given a pair (V, ϕ) as in Theorem 1. By Theorem 6 the

basin of attraction of the dicritical singularity p is the whole space V , i.e Bp = V . By

Theorem 5 there is a biholomorphic conjugacy h : V

between ϕ and λ. Finally,

by Proposition 1 the variety

V

is aﬃne and the the action λ of C∗ on

→ V

in some aﬃne

V

coordinates is good. Note that our proof gives an alternative proof of Proposition 1.1.3,

page 207 in [14].

19

Proof of Theorem 2. Each data in Theorem 2 gives us a linear model variety (

V

, λ) and in

a similar way as in Theorem 5 we can prove that two linear models are biholomorphic if

and only their correspondings data are the same. On the other hand, we have proved that

each pair (V, ϕ) as in Theorem 1 is biholomorphic to a linear model variety (

V

, λ).

Proof of Corollary 1. Since V is smooth, the resolution process of p

V is the blow-

up resolution ([17]) for the foliation

projective line. Thus, by Theorem 1 there is a good action σQ on

ϕ at p. In particular, σ0 is a negatively embedded
