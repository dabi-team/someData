Abstract 

 The T-980 bent  crystal  collimation  experiment  at  the  Tevatron  [1,  2]  has  recently  acquired 
substantial enhancements. First, two new crystals  - a 16-strip one manufactured and characterized by 
the INFN Ferrara group and a quasi-mosaic crystal manufactured and characterized by the PNPI group. 
Second,  a  two  plane  telescope  with  3  high-resolution  pixel  detectors  per  plane  along  with 
corresponding mechanics, electronics, control and software has been manufactured, tested and installed 
in the E0 crystal region. The purpose of the pixel telescope is to measure and image  channeled (CH), 
volume-reflected (VR) and multiple volume-reflected (MVR) beam profiles produced by bent crystals. 
Third,  an  ORIGIN-based  system  has  been  developed  for  thorough  analysis  of  experimental  and 
simulation  data.  Results  of  analysis  are  presented  for  different  types  of  crystals  used  from  2005  to 
present  for  channeling  and  volume  reflection  including  pioneering  tests  of  two-plane  crystal 
collimation at the collider, all in comparison with detailed simulations.

INTRODUCTION 
A  bent  crystal,  used  in  an  accelerator  collimation 
system,  can  coherently  direct  channeled  halo  particles 
deeper into a nearby secondary absorber. This results in a 
reduction  of  outscattering  from  the  system,  thereby 
reducing  beam  losses  in  critical  locations  and  radiation 
the  downstream  superconducting  magnets. 
loads 
Besides  channelling  process  in  the  bent  crystal,  the 
reflection  of  the  particles  from  bent  crystalline  planes 
takes  place  when  particles  pass  through  the  crystal  or 
through the array of the aligned crystals (case of multiple 
volume  reflection).  That  is  why  beginning  from  1980s 
collimation systems based on bent crystals are considered 
as  an 
interesting  promising  option  for  high-energy 
accelerators and colliders.  

THE TEVATRON EXPERIMENT 
The  Tevatron  T-980  experiment  layout  [1,  2]  is 
illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  Current  setup  incorporates  two 
goniometers, vertical and horizontal, supporting the use of 
3 crystals (2 in the vertical plane and 1 in the horizontal). 
The  horizontal  goniometer  is  mounted  with  an  O-shaped 
crystal O-05-09. The vertical goniometer is mounted with 
a  multistrip  MS-08-09  crystal  in  the  upstream  position 
and  a  multistrip  crystal  MS-16-11  in  the  downstream

position.  Both  goniometers  are  located  ~  27m  (vertical) 
and 24m (horizontal) upstream of a secondary collimator 
E03.  Each  crystal  is  inserted  into  the  beam  halo  at 
from  the  core  and  the  angle  of  the  crystal  is  changed  to 
locate  angular  position  for  CH,  VR  and  MVR.  The  E03 
collimator  intercepts  channelled  beam  for  O-shaped  and 
quasi-mosaic  crystals  and  MVR  beam  for  multistrip 
crystals.

   The  F17  collimator  intercepts  VR  beam  for  O-shaped 
and  quasi-mosaic  crystals  and  channelled  beam  for 
multistrip  crystals.  The  F17  collimator  is  located  about 
1.3 km downstream of E0 (see Fig. 2). 

T-980 Crystals 

Three  types  of  bent  crystals  were  used  during  the 
experiments  existence  2005 
to  present:  O-shaped, 
multistrip  and  quasi-mosaic  crystal.  Below  is  a  short 
description,  the  main  parameters  and  the  schematic 
pictures of each type of crystal. Table 1 gives an overview 
of all crystals used for the experiment T-980. 

O-shaped. There are two silicon O-shaped crystals: O-
BNL-02 and O-05-09, which utilize the (110) channelling 
plane. The bend is achieved with the stainless steel holder 
by  applying  inward  pressure  on  the  long  sides  of  the 
crystal,  forcing  the  short  side  to  bulge  outward  (see  Fig. 
3).  O-BNL-02  was  used  as  a  horizontal  deflector  for 
  bend 
about  4  years  (2005-2009)  and  it  has  410 
angle,  5  mm  size  along  the  beam  direction  and  1.6 
bend angle, 
5  mm  length  along  the  beam  and  the  miscut  angle  of 

miscut angle. O-05-09 has 360

Angular and collimator scans 

There  are  two  types of scans produced during End-of-
Store  studies  for  each  crystal.  The  results  allow  the 
channelling efficiency and the collimation efficiency to be 
estimated  for  the  crystal  and  the  system  as  a  whole. 
Angular scans are performed by measuring losses at E03 
while the orientation of the crystal angle is changed (see 
Fig. 6 for O-BNL-02). The E03 collimator distance from 
the beam is set to roughly 6- slightly further than that 
of the crystal. In principle, a loss peak is expected on the 
E03  collimator  when  the  halo  particles  are  aligned  with 
the  crystalline  planes  at  the  entrance  face  of  the  crystal. 
The angular acceptance for channelling is predicted to be

Quasi-Mosaic.  This  crystal  exploits  the  elastic  quasi-
mosaicity  effect.  The  bending  device  again  uses 
anticlastic effects  which are  designed to bend the crystal 
in the one plane conforming it to the principal curvature. 
The  anticlastic  forces  produce  a  secondary  curvature  in 
the  perpendicular  plane  which  causes  the  quasi-mosaic 
curvature of the atomic plane (in our case (111)).  

Figure 6: Typical angular and collimator scans. 

Collimator scans are used to measure the deflection of the 
channeled  beam  once  the  crystal  angle  is  set  to  the 
channeling  peak.  The  E03  collimator  is  slowly  being 
moved into the beam starting from a completely retracted 
position. 

There are three distinct regions (see Fig. 6):

When the collimator finally touches the beam envelope, 
the losses rise abruptly and the PIN diode signal decreases 
to  zero,  as  the  collimator  becomes  the  primary  scatterer 
masking 
the  expected 
displacement of the channeled beam (middle of Region 2) 
with  respect  to  the  beam  envelope  is  10  mm,  while  the 
measured  distance  is  only  7  mm.  For  O-05-09  and  for 
MS-08-09  the  expected  displacements  of  CH  beam  are 
about 8 mm and 7 mm, respectively. 

Analysis system (Origin based) 

The data analysis based on an Origin Software package 
has been developed to analyze all T-980 data. For angular 
scan  data,  a  piece-wised  fitting  function  consists  of  2 
exponential  parts,  a  Gaussian  function  corresponding  to 
the channelling peak, and a  plateau region corresponding 
to  volume  reflection    or  multi  volume  reflection.  For 
collimator scans, the fitting function consists of the error 
function  for  the  channelling  region,  a  quadratic  function 
for the dechannelled particles and an exponential tale for 
the  amorphous  scattering  region.  Also,  the  baseline 
(constant value) corresponding to the background noise is 
added  to  this  function.  The  result  allows  an  estimate  of 
the efficiency of the channelling process in the crystal, as 
well  as  determining  important  parameters  such  as  the 
channelling  peak  angle,  CH  and  VR  angle  acceptance, 
etc., as shown in Table 1. 

PIXEL telescope 

A  PIXEL  telescope  has  been  designed  and  built  for 
observation and tracking of deflected particles in front of 
the E03 collimator. The design of the E0 pixel is based on 
the  original  CMS  forward  pixel  detector  (see  Fig.  7).  It 
allows tracking of particles through the 3 pixels providing 
a  profile  or  image  of  the  channelled  or  volume  reflected 
particles.

CONCLUSIONS AND PLANS 
The T-980 group has achieved a few significant results 
over  last  6  years.  Both  O-shaped  crystals  are  easy  to 
operate;  they  produce  clear  reproducible  signals  for  CH 
and VR regions. Also, they have a significant bend angle, 
so the deflected channeled and volume reflected particles 
could be intercepted by the E03 and F17 collimators. The 
estimated  channeling  efficiency  is  about  75  %  for  O-
BNL-02 and 70 % for O-05-09.  

Multistrip  crystals  have  a  broad  angular  acceptance 
signifying  their  biggest  advantage  for  operation  and 
performance  in  the  Tevatron.  MS-08-09  demonstrated 
both  CH  and  MVR  effects  with  estimated  volume 
reflection efficiency of about 70%.  

The quasi-mosaic  crystal has  been studied  for the past 
few  months.  However,  it  did  not  produce  any  relevant 
channeling  effects.  After  a  detailed  analysis,  it  has  been 
concluded  that  the  QM-PIN  diode  configuration  needed 
improvements and, most important, the beam was hitting 
the boundary of the crystal and holder. This mainly stems 
from  the  style  of  holder  the  crystal  is  mounted  in  and 
beam  conditions  at  the  end  of  the  colliding  beam  stores. 
Constraining  the  crystal  in  the  holder  is  too  difficult  to 
provide reproducible results in an operational collider [4]. 
Results  and  experience  of  the  T-980  experiment  are 
important 
and  make 
recommendations on the use of bent crystal systems in the 
energy  frontier colliders, including LHC. One of them is 
that  T980  certainly  favors  the  use  of  the  multistrip 
crystals. The experiment will continue until the end of the 
Tevatron  Collider  Run  II  (which  is  currently  scheduled 
for  Oct  1,  2011),  with  focus  on  imaging  channeled, 
volume  reflected  and  multiple-VR  beams  with  the  E0 
pixel 
to  demonstrate  an 
operational  effectiveness  of  a  2-plane  crystal  collimation
