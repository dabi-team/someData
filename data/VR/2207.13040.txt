Abstract - Despite the molecular evidence that the nearly linear steady-state current-voltage relationship in 
mammalian astrocytes reflects a total current resulting from more than one differently regulated 𝐾+ 
conductances, detailed ODE models of membrane voltage 𝑉𝑚 are still lacking. Repeated experimental results 
of deregulated expressions of major 𝐾+ channels in glia, Kir4.1, in models of neurodegenerative disease, as 
well as their altered rectification when assembling heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels have motivated us to 
attempt a detailed model incorporating the weaker potassium K2P-TREK1 current, in addition to Kir4.1, and 
study the stability of the resting state 𝑉𝑟. The main question is whether with a deregulated Kir conductivity the 
nominal resting state 𝑉𝑟 remains stable, and the cell retains a trivial, potassium electrode behavior with 𝑉𝑚 
following 𝐸𝐾. The minimal 2-dimensional model near 𝑉𝑟 showed that certain alterations of Kir4.1 current may 
result in multistability of 𝑉𝑚 if the typically observed 𝐾+currents - Kir, K2P, and non-specific potassium leak 
are present. More specifically, a decrease or loss of outward Kir4.1 conductance (turning the channels into 
inwardly rectifying) introduces instability of 𝑉𝑟, near 𝐸𝐾. That happens through robustly observed fold 
bifurcation giving birth to a second, much more depolarized stable resting state 𝑉𝑑𝑟 > −10 𝑚𝑉. Realistic time 
series were used to perturb the membrane model, from recordings of glial 𝑉𝑚 during electrographic seizures. 
Simulations of the perturbed system by constant currents through gap-junctions and transient seizure-like 
discharges as local field potentials led to depolarization of the astrocyte and switching of 𝑉𝑚 between the two 
stable states, in a downstate – upstate manner. If the prolonged depolarizations near 𝑉𝑑𝑟 prove 
experimentally plausible, such catastrophic instability would impact all aspects of the glial function, from 
metabolic support to membrane transport and practically all neuromodulatory roles assigned to glia. 

Statement of Significance – The almost linear current-voltage relationship of most glial membranes 
results from multiple non-linear potassium leaky-pore, or background conductances. The corresponding 
channel types develop and deregulate independently, some of them asymmetrically – deregulate differently 
in different 𝑉𝑚 ranges. Effect of those deregulations on whole-cell voltage responses has not been treated. 
We developed a minimal ODE model of voltage dynamics incorporating detailed models of the different 
potassium currents based on electrophysiological recordings. Parametrically inducing some of the reported 
deregulations of Kir current in glia resulted in instability of the nominal resting membrane potential and 
appearence of a second much more depolarized resting state. If prolonged glial depolarizations prove 
plausible such bistability would change the present beliefs about glial 𝑉𝑚 dynamics.

Introduction 

Membrane voltage control in glia - The temporal dynamics of membrane voltage (𝑉𝑚) of glial 
cells, the non-excitable neural cells, is a difficult subject to treat due to their structure-function 
complexity, and the experimental limitations to precisely measure 𝑉𝑚 of their leaky membrane by the 
standard electrophysiological methods [1]. The classical, more than 50 years old view of the glial 
membrane as a passive potassium electrode [2] reflected the early observations that 
𝐾+conductances in astrocytes accounting for the major part of ion conductivity near the resting 
voltage are of Ohmic nature. It is important to note that those early observations, lacking molecular 
specificity, have come from studies with a rather narrow experimental focus on the glial role in ion 
homeostasis, i.e., in the removal of the excess extracellular 𝐾+ following sustained neuronal firing. 
Intensive molecular studies in the last twenty years seriously challenged the view of purely passive 
electrochemical response capability of glia, upon evidence that their membrane voltage 𝑉𝑚is 
transiently perturbed by different electrogenic pathways through transporters and ionotropic 
receptors [3], [4], expressed with certain variations by both neurons and glia. Today we know that 

1 

  
glial glutamate and GABA transporters, and even more intriguingly ionotropic glutamate and GABA 
receptors in some glia cell types [5], do alter glial 𝑉𝑚, [6] and therefore introduce forms of feedback 
control of their respective neuromodulatory functions. Such different control roles of glial 𝑉𝑚 
translate to a wide range of cellular and systemic functions from glucose transport and 
neurotransmitter recycling, via responses to mechanical and acidic stress, to the regulation of 
excitation-inhibition balance in local circuits.  

Therefore, with the glial 𝑉𝑚 playing both roles: a control variable (controller) of different 
neuromodulatory loops, as well as itself being a neuromodulatory target, the dynamical stability of 
glial resting membrane voltage 𝑉𝑟 in response to various perturbations remains a central question in 
quantitative whole-cell modeling of glia. Such a dual effect of 𝑉𝑚 as a variable, further qualifies the 
glial membrane as a sensor and transducer of 𝐾+ changes as a signal, which perspective has been 
pushed by pioneers of glial biology [7] but further demands explanatory biophysical models.  

The typical, transient perturbations of glial 𝑉𝑚 comes either as: (i) transient variations of local field 
potential which directly polarize the membrane, (ii) varying trans-junctional voltage at the gap-
junction connections of heavily interconnected astrocytic cells, or (iii) as transiently altered [𝐾+]𝑜. 
Prospective dynamical modeling studies would try to distinguish the specific, causal responses of 
glial 𝑉𝑚 to a specific form of modulation, from the permanent stochastic electrochemical or other 
perturbations of 𝑉𝑚 near the 𝑉𝑟.  
Variations of 𝑽𝒎 in a steady and perturbed glial membrane -  Experimental studies of astrocytes 
in situ, the most abundant glial cell subtype in the brain, find that their 𝑉𝑚 in nominal conditions 
fluctuates within a narrow range [8], [1]. From several millivolts, in response to nominal fluctuations 
of the local field, up to 10 ÷ 20 𝑚𝑉 more depolarized from 𝑉𝑟 in cases of seizures, other strong 
synchronous discharges in the neighboring neurons or spreading depolarizations accompanied by 
high, transiently elevated [𝐾+]𝑜 [9], [10], or [11] for review. Even though accumulated extracellular 
𝐾+depolarizes glia, it is not clear how fast, and how closely glial 𝑉𝑚 follows the perturbed 𝐸𝐾 when 
both active and passive transport mechanisms switch in, and what is in turn the sign of the driving 
force Δ𝑉𝑚 = 𝑉𝑚 − 𝐸𝐾 that direct the leaky currents in sustained depolarizations. Typically, the 
reversal potential of the isolated macroscopic Kir and K2P currents is close, but slightly more 
positive to the Nernstian reversal potential of potassium, 𝐸𝐾, and closer to the cell resting voltage 𝑉𝑟 
which is typically between −80 𝑚𝑉 to −70 𝑚𝑉 in glial cells, in situ. A relevant dynamical model of 𝑉𝑚 
would thus require incorporating the minimal, yet detailed description of the major glial ion 
conductances active near 𝑉𝑟, over several timescales from milliseconds to minutes, under 
assumption [𝐾+]𝑜 dynamics is not modeled, i.e., 𝐸𝐾 remains a changeable parameter.  

Figure 1 - Potassium current profile in isolated astrocytes – Kir4.1 
current isolated as 𝐵𝑎2+sensitive, by application of 0.1mM BaCl (circles / 
line, N=9) reverses at  𝑉𝑟𝑒𝑣 ≈ 75.35mV, compared to the total 𝐾+current, 
black solid line (data from [12]). Of the remaining 𝐾+conductance, K2P 
current (max. 0.23 nA at +30mV), was isolated as quinine-sensitive, 
triangles / line. The transcript analysis of the K2P channels suggested a 
prevalence of K2P2.1 TREK1 isoform [12]. The sum of Kir4.1 and K2P2.1 
current accounts for 82% of the total current at -120mV, and 80% at 
+30mV. Recordings from 9 cells, with a mean effective patch capacitance 
of 20 pF, have been normalized, averaged, and rescaled in the measured 
current range. 

Figure 1 shows the steady-state current-voltage (I-V) recordings of the total 𝐾+current, as well as 
the isolated Kir4.1 and K2P-TREK1 currents in our data, obtained under whole-cell voltage-clamp 
protocol in 𝑁 = 9 freshly isolated astrocytes from mouse hippocampus, bathed in slightly elevated 
extracellular [𝐾+]𝑜 = 5 𝑚𝑀 [12]. In steady-state conditions under a physiological 𝐾+ concentration 
gradient, the barium 𝐵𝑎2+- sensitive weakly rectified Kir4.1 current (circles) dominates the total 
current profile (solid line). Even though much weaker in resting conditions, the K2P current 

2 

 
(triangles) has different kinetics and electrochemical regulation, which requires to have it 
incorporated into any quantitation of 𝐾+conductivity in astroglia, either experimental or theoretical. 
Describing these dominant 𝐾+background currents in isolated astrocytes from mouse hippocampus 
[12] together with a small 𝐾+leak current is the central modeling effort in this study. The isolated 
𝐾+currents operate close to, and therefore define the resting membrane potential 𝑉𝑟 in the proposed 
minimal ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of 𝑉𝑚 dynamics. Apart of 𝐾+ conductances, no 
other major conductances have been verified in astrocytes in the voltage range around 𝑉𝑟, assuming 
no osmolar stress which triggers non-negligible 𝐶𝑙− transients. Co-expressed Kir and K2P channels 
account for the major fraction of potassium channels in almost all glial cells in the brain [13], 
cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts [14], [15], as well as in various cell types in renal epithelia 
[16], [17]. With over forty different channel isoforms in total, the co-occurrence of Kir and K2P 
channels in these, as well as in other tissues [18] is pervasive, resulting in different 𝐾+channel mix 
and therefore different I-V curves and kinetic properties of the total current. 

Parametric analysis of the model reproducing some of the observed biological (de)regulation of 
those conductances suggests that astrocytic 𝑉𝑚 could be prone to multistability in case of 
deregulation of the major weakly-rectified Kir4.1 current (WR-Kir). Numerical simulations of the 
model perturbed using realistic recordings from glia in-situ [9], illustrated the bistability of the 
otherwise stable resting state. Although a mix of only 𝐾+conductances may give rise to two 
membrane resting states, already observed experimentally in cardiomyocytes [14], and described 
by a simple, generic minimal 2-dimensional conductance-based model [19], it has not been 
demonstrated so far in the glial membrane or simulated numerically using a glia-specific model.

Model of astroglial whole-cell 𝐕𝐦 dynamics  

Detailed electrophysiological studies of glial1 conductances [12] are rare, and a widely accepted 
minimal dynamical model of 𝑉𝑚 in astrocytes is therefore lacking. Further to the experimental 
complexity mentioned above, depending on the model system, sometimes additional regulation of 
these conductances by other environmental stimuli requires specific quantitation.  

In what follows we outline the description of experimentally measured steady-state I-V relationships 
of Kir4.1 and K2P-TREK1 conductances. The nonexistence of a voltage-sensing domain - a 
structure present in other gated 𝐾+channels, suggests their rectification properties come from 
permeability regulation by physiological blocking ions, or by other Coulombic interactions on a pore 
level [20] resulting in voltage activation. The suggested modeling approaches to either Kir or K2P 
currents do not follow the Hodgkin-Huxley approach for gated channels but reflect their known 
biophysics as open pores. The proposed models could be applied as-are to a different mix of those 
channels in different cells or tissues. In the rest of the text, for the cell-specific aspects, without loss 
of generality, we restrict to an isolated hippocampal astrocyte as our model system [12]. 

Steady-state I-V model of weakly-rectified Kir current - Since the early quantitative 
2.1 
studies, the conductivity of Kir channels under changing [𝐾+]𝑜, [21] indicate that Kir channels 
display voltage dependence on the electrochemical driving force Δ𝑉𝑚 = 𝑉𝑚 − 𝐸𝐾, rather than solely 
on the net membrane voltage 𝑉𝑚. This implies that proposed models should: (i) allow for variable 
[𝐾+]𝑜, and (ii) describe qualitative changes on different timescales, relevant not only for the 
millisecond 𝑉𝑚 dynamics, but for the slower [𝐾+]𝑜 variations spanning from hundreds of 
milliseconds to seconds and minutes, as well.  

Our central modeling proposition is a detailed description of the I-V relationship of the weakly-
rectifying potassium Kir current (WR-Kir), rather than straightforwardly assigning the Hagiwara 
model of strongly inwardly-rectifying channels in egg cells [21]. The Hagiwara model is usually 
chosen under the assumption that 𝑉𝑚 is very tightly regulated round the negative resting potential of 
𝑉𝑟 ≈ −80𝑚𝑉, which is oversimplification because astrocytic 𝑉𝑚 is exposed to perturbations that 

1 In the rest of the text, we will interchangeably use the terms glia, astroglia or astrocytes for the population of the 
astrocytic cells. Where reference is made to other glial cell types, those are named specifically.

significantly depolarize the cell into a 𝑉𝑚 range where the curves of inwardly and weakly rectified Kir 
current markedly differ. To fill this gap requires describing quantitatively the outward conductivity of 
WR-Kir channels, which represent a comparable fraction to the inward component, Fig. 1 (circles). 

The key assumption is that the steady-state WR-Kir current, Fig. 1 (circles), could be dissected into 
two additive components: a) inwardly rectified Kir component 𝐼𝐾𝑖𝑟, and b) outwardly rectified, or 
residual Kir component 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠, so that for the total isolated 𝐵𝑎2+-sensitive Kir4.1 current we can write:   

𝐼𝐾𝑖𝑟 = 𝐼𝑖𝑛𝑤 + 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠               (𝑛𝐴).

The two unidirectional fluxes result from a different manifestation of a voltage-dependent block of 
the pore by polyvalent cation which in turn result in different outward and inward permeation. 
Structure-function studies of Kir channels have shown a large extent of molecular similarity between 
the strongly and weakly rectifying channels, where a single point mutation dominantly impacts 
unidirectional permeation in open pores [22], [23]. We describe the permeation on a short-pore 
model of 𝐾+pore, formulated using a simplified one-dimensional reaction coordinate. It is generic for 
all 𝐾+open pores, where the cytoplasmic domain of the channel is ignored as not critical for 
describing the permeation, Fig. A1. See Appendix 1 for a detailed description of the short-pore and 
further biophysical reasoning on the legitimacy of modeling two separate, additive fluxes in the 
weakly rectifying Kir pore, see Appendix-1. In the rest of the text charge will be represented in molar 
units of 𝐹, (𝐶 𝑚𝑜𝑙
) and the energy in the energy profiles will be normalized by 𝑅𝑇 = 0.593 𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑙/𝑚𝑜𝑙 
at 𝑇 = 298 𝐾 accordingly and expressed in RT units.

Inwardly rectified WR-Kir flux results from a negative driving force, Δ𝑉𝑚 < 0, where the blocking 
ions, 𝑀𝑔2+or other polyvalent cations are kept within the water cavity (Fig.A1.B) of the short-pore by 
Coulombic forces of the negative residues of transmembrane helices (Fig. A1.A). Such ion-crowding 
of permeant and blocking ions (Fig. A1.B) results in an inward pseudo gating of the WR-Kir pore 
producing an equilibrium probability of open, inwardly conducting pore described by Boltzmann 
term, as originally introduced by the Hagiwara model [21]: 

𝐼𝑖𝑛𝑤 = 𝑔𝐾𝑖𝑟−𝑖𝑛𝑤(𝑉𝑚 − 𝐸𝐾𝑖𝑟)       (𝑛𝐴) 

𝑔𝐾𝑖𝑟−𝑖𝑛𝑤(Δ𝑉𝑚) =

𝐴 𝑔̅𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤√[𝐾]𝑜

Δ𝑉𝑚 = (𝑉𝑚 − 𝐸𝐾𝑖𝑟),   Δ𝑉12_𝑖𝑛𝑤 = (𝑉12−𝑖𝑛𝑤 − 𝐸𝐾𝑖𝑟)      (𝑚𝑉), 

(2) 

(3) 

where 𝑔̅𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤 represents the maximal value of the 𝑔𝐾𝑖𝑟−𝑖𝑛𝑤 obtained as a slope of the linear 
segment in the recorded I/V curve negative of 𝐸𝐾, 𝑉12_𝑖𝑛𝑤 is the voltage at half-maximal 
conductance, 𝑧𝑖𝑛𝑤represents the effective charge valence of permeant ions in the short-pore, 𝐸𝐾𝑖𝑟 =
−76 𝑚𝑉 is the reversal voltage of the isolated Kir4.1 current, and 𝐴 = 1.0 𝑚𝑀−1 2⁄  keeps the 
conductance of 𝜇𝑆. Figure 2A, the solid black curve, shows a fitted sigmoid function, Eq. 3, to 
numerically differentiated Kir4.1 I-V data, from Fig. 1 (blue curve, for [𝐾+]o = 5mM), for 𝑉𝑚 more 
negative than 𝐸𝐾𝑖𝑟. Such numerically obtained series physically represents a slope conductance, 
whereas the values more negative to -110mV (blue crosses) are discarded due to slope deviation 
(Fig.1) originating from a known effect of voltage-dependent pore block by external 𝑁𝑎+ions [24], 
[25]. The fitting gave 𝐴 ∙ 𝑔̅𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤√[𝐾]𝑜 = 20.6 𝑛𝑆, 𝑉12_𝑖𝑛𝑤 = −53.5 𝑚𝑉 and 𝑧𝑖𝑛𝑤 = 1.638, producing the 
blue curve in Fig. 2B. The effective charge 𝑧𝑖𝑛𝑤, was in accordance with published charge estimates 
for the voltage dependence of block by small ions, for a summary see [26]. The slope factor 𝑣𝑠 ≡
𝑅𝑇 𝐹⁄ = 25.7 𝑚𝑉, corresponding to room temperature of 𝑇 = 298.13 𝐾 is kept constant throughout 
the text. 

Outwardly rectified Kir4.1 flux results from outward pseudo gating for a more positive driving force 
𝑉𝑚 > −60𝑚𝑉 (Fig. A1.C), where outwardly directed driving force pushes partly or fully dehydrated

blocking ion towards the entry of the selectivity filter (SF), see Appendix 1. Such electrostatic, 
flickering block modulates ion association to the pore and the outward permeation.

Non-constant field Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) model of WR-Kir outward current - Without 
a voltage gate as a structural determinant of gating in Kir and K2P pores, other features like 
physiological block by cytoplasmic cations may produce pseudo gating by charge movement within 
the membrane or alter the Coulombic and/or structural forces defining open-pore permeability within 
the single global state of the channel.  

We arrive at the proposed model of the residual current using the following assumptions: 

•  GHK formalism without constant-field assumption describes the outward conductivity, 

using Eq. 5 as a general form of GHK current equation before introducing the constant-field 
assumption [27], chapter 13.13. Instead, a simple, quadratic potential energy profile of an 
elastic force 𝑈(𝑥) introduces a parabolic energy barrier in the energy profile of an open Kir 
pore, Fig.3A, with the voltage drop over the pore added as linear, 𝑉𝑚(𝑥) = 𝑥Δ𝑉𝑚. The 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥 
potential represents the peak of the association barrier to the permeant 𝐾+ ion at the entry of 
hydrophobic SF in 𝑅𝑇 units. The barrier is centered at transition state 𝑥𝑇, while the positive 𝑤 
is the force constant of the elastic restoration force of Coulombic nature. For the charge in 
molar equivalents and the concentrations in [𝑚𝑀], we will describe the outward current 
using: 

𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 = 𝑧𝐹𝐷

[𝐾+]𝑖 − [𝐾+]𝑜𝑒−
𝑏
∫ 𝑒𝑈(𝑥)−𝑧𝐹𝑉𝑚(𝑥) 𝑅𝑇⁄
𝑎

𝑧𝐹𝑉𝑚
𝑅𝑇

𝑑𝑥

      (𝑛𝐴), 

(5) 

𝑈(𝑥) = 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑤(𝑥 − 𝑥𝑇)2       (𝑅𝑇 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑠). 

We can extend the interval (𝑎, 𝑏) to (−∞, +∞) because the energy profile falls sharply 
outside the short pore. Depending on the description of 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑉𝑚) the location of 𝑥𝑇 could 
change, resulting in an asymmetrical shape of the barrier, sketched in Fig. 3A, dashed line, 
compared to the symmetrical case in Fig. 3B (barrier not shown). Different positions of the 
transition state, 𝑥𝑇 = 𝑙𝑠𝑝/2 in Fig. 3A, and 𝑥𝑇 = 𝑙𝑠𝑝/3 in Fig. 3B simply illustrate different 
model assumptions for the barrier position.

Figure 3 – Reaction coordinate in the model of WR-Kir outward permeation – (A) Quadratic energy barrier 
profile centered at the transition state 𝑥𝑇 used in Goldman-Godgkin-Katz description of the outward flux of Kir4.1 
current. Here the reaction coordinate starts at the center of the cavity, and the 𝛿𝑉𝑚 fraction of the voltage drops 
over the reaction coordinate, with a full length 𝑙𝑆𝑃 = 1. (B) Sketch of the Marcus free energy formalism defining 
voltage-dependence of 𝑥𝑇and the barrier height 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥. Voltage-dependent shift of 𝑥𝑇(𝑉𝑚) from 𝑇 to 𝑇1and the 
selection of 𝜆1 and 𝜆2 positions of the energy wells in (B) produce either a symmetric (solid line) or skewed 
barrier at the top (dashed line) in (A). Here, compared to (A), the reaction coordinate spreads over the whole 
short-pore, and 𝑥𝑇 = 1/2 places the peak of the symmetrical barrier at the entry of SF. (C) and (D) peak 
behavior of 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥, Eq. 7, and non-constant GHK permeability (9) at 𝑉𝐶 = −23 𝑚𝑉 which will produce maximal 
outward current 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠. The peak of 𝑃𝐺𝐻𝐾 in (D) suggests the facilitating Coulombic effect of a polyvalent blocker 
on the outward permeation is maximal at 𝑉𝐶 above which it gradually turns into full pore occlusion. 

•  Partial voltage-dependent pore occlusion by cytoplasmic cations activates the pore in 
the outward direction – In this model voltage-driven localization of polyvalent cytoplasmic 
cations in the cavity produces a partial, flickering pore occlusion, Fig. 3A, which increases 
the Coulombic repulsion on the permeant ion associated with the SF. Such partial blocking 
serves as a plausible modulatory mechanism, with the pore remaining in a single open 
conformation. Therefore, both, the pseudo-gating on pore-level and the macroscopic current 
rectification are attributed to the voltage dependence of the block. This defines a voltage-
dependent probability of an activated pore with an effective, equivalent charge 𝑧𝐵 > 1, 
reflecting the valence of the blocking ion (𝑀𝑔2+ or positively charged polyamines), not 
necessarily implicating a multi-ion pore. We illustrate this blocking configuration along the 
reaction coordinate of the short-pore model on the sketch in Figure A1.C, as a displacement 
of the blocking 𝑀𝑔2+ion from S6 (center of the cavity) towards the S5 ion coordination site 
(SF entrance). To formulate the modulatory effect of blocking as a probability of outward 
activation in a non-gated channel, we use the Boltzmann equation in a classical way [27], 
chapter 1.12: 

𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 1
⁄
1 + 𝑒−𝑧𝐵(𝑉𝑚−𝑉12−𝑜𝑢𝑡)/𝑣𝑠

.  

(6) 

Since both, the Hagiwara model of Kir, as well as more recent permeation studies on K2P 
channels [28], suggested electro-chemical gating in 𝐾+pores, with effective driving force 
Δ𝑉𝑚 = 𝑉𝑚 − 𝐸𝐾, applying it within Boltzmann equation cancels out the reversal potential 𝐸𝐾 in 
Eq. 6, as it also appears in the half-activation voltage Δ𝑉12−𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑉12−𝑜𝑢𝑡 − 𝐸𝐾 (same as in 
Eq. 3). The slope factor 𝑣𝑠 is the same defined within the model for inward flux. 

•  Quadratic dependence of barrier peak 𝑼𝒎𝒂𝒙 on voltage saturates the outward flux - We 

are adding nonlinear dependence of Marcus form, Eq. 7, to introduce a simple form of 
Coulombic contribution of the voltage-dependent block in 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥 according to [27], see 
chapters 7.6 and 7.8: 

𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑉𝑚) = 𝐺0(𝜆 − 𝑥𝑇)2 = 𝐺0 (𝜆 −

which can describe the saturation of outward flux for very positive applied voltages, Fig.4. 
Figure 3B shows qualitatively the geometry of the Marcus energy landscape and 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑉𝑚) 
over a simplified, one-dimensional reaction coordinate. The peak of the barrier 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥 at the 
intersection of the two parabolic wells, 2𝜆1 and 2𝜆2 wide, defines the transition state 𝑥𝑇. It 
separates the left energy well where the permeant ion dwells before the outwardly directed 
field drives it to the SF and the right well where the ion is associated to the pore. The critical 
parameter influencing 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥 voltage dependence is the fraction of the linear voltage drop 𝛿 =
1/2 that falls under the energy profile, reducing it to 𝛿Δ𝑉𝑚
quadratic profile of 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑉𝑚) with the minimum attained at a critical voltage 𝑉𝐶 = −23 𝑚𝑉. 
The nonlinear 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑉𝑚) dependence is significant for capturing the outward WR-Kir current 
saturation with voltage [29], [30], [20] which is not possible with a constant or linearly 
dependent 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥. The prefactor 𝐺0 in RT units represents the height of the constant barrier 
due to hydrophobic repulsion in the absence of electrochemical driving force. 

2. Figure 3C illustrates the 

Equation 7 is based on the Marcus chemical kinetics theory describing the charge transfer in 
chemical bonding, using reaction rate models [31], which has meanwhile gained a wider 
acceptance in treating quasi-equilibrium changes in proteins, for review see [32]. We stress 
that we use here qualitative features of very simplified one-dimensional reaction coordinate 
in the Marcus theory, to describe macroscopic properties, like the saturation in the voltage 
dependence of block in measurements of macroscopic whole-cell currents, rather than to 
construct a model for predicting permeation rates or estimating the microscopic parameters 
of the pore, like 𝑧𝐵 or 𝐺0 [33]. 

Under the above assumptions, by solving the Gaussian integral in the nominator of Eq. 5 and 
simplifying the solution by setting a fixed position 𝑥𝑇 = 1/2 [27], for the outward residual component 
𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 of isolated Kir4.1 current we obtain: 

𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 = 𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑧𝐹𝑃𝐺𝐻𝐾 ([𝐾+]𝑖𝑒

𝑧𝑉𝑚
2𝑣𝑠 − [𝐾+]𝑜𝑒

−

2𝑣𝑆 )        (𝑛𝐴). 

(8) 

𝑥𝑇 = 1/2 places the transition state and 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥 at the entry of the SF where the blocking ion should 
be localized for positive Δ𝑉𝑚, which is close to 1/2 of the length of the short pore with the cavity 
approximately 10Å in diameter, and the SF length typically approximated to 12 ÷ 15Å, depending on 
the structure-function assumptions. The simplification removes 𝑥𝑇(Δ𝑉𝑚) shift which if present, for 
illustration, for Δ𝑉𝑚 = 𝑣𝑠, 𝜆1 = 𝜆2 = 1/4, with 𝑧𝐵 = 1.6 and 𝐺𝑜 = 6.6 𝑅𝑇 obtained by fitting Eq. 8 to the 
series obtained by Eq. 4, shifts 𝑥𝑇 from 0.5 to 0.56. 

Having departed from the classical Nernst-Planck assumptions in solving Eq. 5 for a macroscopic 
description of 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠, by using Eq. 7 to add modulation of permeability by voltage-dependent block, 
𝑃𝐺𝐻𝐾 introduced in Eq. 8 absorbs the resulting prefactors and implicitly defines voltage-dependent 
permeability [27]:

Here 𝑤 is the same force factor from the harmonic potential 𝑈(𝑥) in (5), and 𝐷 is the classical, 
constant diffusion coefficient, both absorbed within the constant, voltage-independent 
𝐾+permeability 𝑃𝐾 multiplied by a factor of Arrhenius activation form with voltage-dependent barrier 
𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑉𝑚) introduced in Eq. 8. The zero RT minimum of 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑉𝐶), Fig. 3C, should be interpreted as 
a zero of the voltage-dependent potential energy profile at which we observe the maximal 
permeability 𝑃𝐺𝐻𝐾 reducing to the constant value of 𝑃𝐾 = 7.63 × 10−8 cm/s in Nernst-Planck electro-
diffusion, Eq. 9, Fig. 3D. The estimate is within the same order of magnitude as the ranges in the 
early studies of rectification in potassium channels, see [34] for a review. For references where

Fitting 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 model (10) with 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥 given by Eq. 7 to the residual outward current data obtained by Eq. 
4, using nonlinear least-squares error, gives the I-V graph in Figure 4A. The peak behavior in Eq. 7 
produces a peak behavior of 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 in a more positive, non-physiological 𝑉𝑚 range for glia, Fig.4B. 
Such shape has already been reported in a study of a whole rodent hippocampus [29], with the 
curve shifted to more negative voltages.  

All the parameter values, the fixed ones, and those obtained by fitting are listed in Table 1. The 
table values of 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 fitting parameters: 𝑃𝐾, 𝑉12−𝑜𝑢𝑡, 𝐺0, 𝑧𝐵, and 𝑧, to be later used in the parameter 
analysis of the model, were obtained as averages of ten curve fitting attempts with one of them 
varied within ±10% of the initial value in each run while the other four were recalculated by the 
NLSQ curve fitting. The blocking ion charge valence was bounded within 1.5 ≤ 𝑧𝐵 ≤ 2.0. The 
goodness of fit 𝑅2 ≥ 0.98 was achieved in all attempts. 

Steady-state I-V model of K2P-TREK1 current – Studies isolating the weaker astrocytic 

2.2 
currents after isolating Kir currents are rare, due to experimental issues with leaky astrocytic 
membrane, and therefore K2P currents are rarely quantified [12], [36]. Figure 5A shows 
pharmacologically isolated K2P current, using quinine, at [𝐾+]𝑜 = 5 𝑚𝑀 (black circles), as well as at 
drastically elevated external potassium at [𝐾+]𝑜 = 50 𝑚𝑀 (blue dots) in our recordings from [12]. 
Both I-V recordings were fitted (solid lines) with the standard GHK current equation [37], even 
though the permeation studies suggest multi-ion occupancy of the pore and some form of pseudo-
gating [28]. Adding a small 𝑁𝑎+permeability [37], 𝑃𝑁𝑎/𝑃𝐾 = 0.06, within nominally non-conductive 
range (below −50 𝑚𝑉) improves the fit at 5 𝑚𝑀, Fig. 5A, dotted line. That effect of 𝑁𝑎+on passive 
𝐾+ conductivity in glia is known [38], but we didn’t use the correction within the numerical 
simulations due to a lack of recordings to verify 𝑃𝑁𝑎/𝑃𝐾 ratio for notably elevated  [𝐾+]𝑜 above 5 
mM. 

The K2P currents in this study [12] originate primarily from the K2P-TREK1 sub-population of K2P 
channels. TREK1 channels are polymodal transducers of different cellular stimuli [39], [40], like 
mechanical pressure or pH shifts that transduce into changes of 𝑉𝑚, so that any distinction between 
steady-state and activated state of these and most of others K2P channels requires careful 
consideration, both experimental and biophysical. Working with steady-state recordings from 
astrocytes isolated in a bath assures that obtained I-V curves represent cells in steady conditions, 
non-transducing an osmolar stress or pH variations, which is implicitly assumed in a baseline model.

with a small 𝑁𝑎+permeability being added (𝑃𝑁𝑎+/𝑃𝐾+ = 0.06, see text). (B) and (C) Approximation of the activation 
kinetics 𝑛𝐾2𝑃(𝑉) of K2P current for [𝐾+]𝑜 = 5mM and 50mM respectively, obtained as (𝑔𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 ⁄ 𝑔̅𝑚𝑎𝑥  )^(1/𝑘), 𝑘 =
2, see text. At 5mM, in (B), the 𝑛𝐾2𝑃 activation estimates for 𝑉𝑚 positive to −50𝑚𝑉 (filled circles) were fitted with 
Boltzmann first-order activation kinetics, ignoring more negative 𝑉𝑚 values where very small currents produced 
erratic estimates of 𝑔𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒, obtained by numerical differentiation (crosses). (C) The loss of voltage-dependent  
activation 𝑛𝐾2𝑃 (as seen in B)  at [𝐾+]𝑜 = 50 𝑚𝑀 was modeled as a gradual [𝐾+]𝑜- dependent shift of the 𝑛𝐾2𝑃 
curve (see Eq. 12b) to the left practically removing the sigmoidal voltage dependence and reducing 𝑛𝐾2𝑃 to 
fluctuations around a mean, constant activation 〈𝑛𝐾2𝑃〉 = 0.66, for voltages in the activated range for K2P current. 
Apart from the outward voltage activation (verified also in a symmetrical 𝐾+concentrations), K2P 
channels show also some form of flux-dependent activation component coming from multi-ion 
occupancy of the pore by the permeant 𝐾+ions [28]. The following two dynamical properties in 
voltage-dependent activation of K2P-TREK1 current are essential for arriving at the full dynamic 
model of 𝑉𝑚: 

o  Activation kinetics - At both concentrations, the whole-cell currents showed activation 
kinetics with 𝜏𝐾2𝑃 ≈ 3 𝑚𝑠, constant over the whole 𝑉𝑚 range. While at 5 𝑚𝑀, above 
−50 𝑚𝑉 we could fit a Boltzmann sigmoidal, voltage-dependent activation, Fig. 5B black 
dots, at drastically elevated, [𝐾+]𝑜 = 50𝑚𝑀 there is no visible voltage dependence, Fig. 5C, 
described with a constant average activation of 〈𝑛𝐾2𝑃〉 = 0.66. 

o  Gating mode change – At elevated external 𝐾+, Fig. 5A, the dominating electrochemical 
activation [28] is changing the I-V curve, resembling more that of the leaky K2P-TWIK 
channels with almost linear dependence, satisfying the GHK current equation and reversing 
close to the Nernst potential. 

Along with these observations we model the astrocytic K2P-TREK1 currents using the GHK current 
model [37], extended with a complex electrochemical activation 𝑛𝐾2𝑃 – coupling the voltage-
dependent activation and electrochemical driving force into a mechanism named ion-flux gating 
[28]:

Allowing for variations of 𝐾+concentrations we cannot keep the intrinsic permeability 𝑃𝐾2𝑃 constant 
[41], contrary to the classical assumptions based on the solubility-diffusion theory [26], [42]. To add 
a simple [𝐾+]𝑜 dependence in 𝑃𝐾2𝑃 we interpolated the fitted values for 𝑃𝐾2𝑃 at 5mM and 50mM with 
𝑏 =
an increasing and slowly saturating 𝐾+dependence, Eq. 12a. The GHK fit at 5mM suggested 𝑃𝐾2𝑃
1.24 x 10−8𝑐𝑚/𝑠 for the baseline permeability, within the order of magnitude with those reported in 
the early studies of electro-diffusion in 𝐾+channels, [43]. As an additional sanity check, the ratio 
⁄
𝑃𝐾 𝑃𝐾2𝑃
and 𝐼𝐾2𝑃, is reasonably close to 5.3, the ratio of their maximal measured values at 30mV, Fig. 1.

Fitting of the sigmoid in Fig.5B to (𝑔𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 ⁄ 𝑔̅𝑚𝑎𝑥  )
concentrations was done with 𝑘 = 2, following as a guiding value the average ion occupancy of the 
SF with 2.2 𝑒0 elementary charge units across different K2P channel subtypes, estimated in [28]. 
Small voltage offset (𝑉𝑚 − 𝑉𝑜𝑓𝑠) not exceeding 5 𝑚𝑉 was needed to stabilize numerically the 
nonlinear LSQ fitting of (11). The same value 𝑧𝐾2𝑃 = 1 was used at both 𝐾+concentrations. 
The nominal, baseline external concentration [𝐾+]𝑜
𝑏 was kept at 2.5 𝑚𝑀 in Eq. 12a. To correct the 
𝑛𝐾2𝑃 activation for variable concentrations two interventions are needed: (i) decreasing trend of the 
maximal activation with [𝐾+]𝑜, Eq. 12b, where the [𝐾+]𝑜/[𝐾+]𝑖 term successfully captures the trend, 
and (ii) shifting the 𝑉12−𝐾2𝑃 (12c) and the whole 𝑛𝐾2𝑃 sigmoid to the left (into non-physiological 
hyperpolarized range) so that the plateau of 〈𝑛𝐾2𝑃〉 = 0.66 covers the most of physiological 𝑉𝑚  
range - practically removing voltage-dependent activation at high [𝐾+]𝑜, Fig. 5C. More recordings 
on different [𝐾+]𝑜 are needed to verify whether the suggested corrections in Eq. 12b and Eq. 12c 
have more general biophysical utility. The relative shift of Nernstian nature in (12c) required a 
scaling factor 𝑆 = 1.7 to get the plateau-like in Fig. 5C. Similar proportionality  of 𝑉12 shift was 
observed in activation curves of the human K2P-TREK1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes 
[28].

To translate the nature and intensity of the perturbations in different experimental preparations into 
changes of model parameters, we refer to (a) static3 alterations of the astrocytic 𝐾+ conductances 
for changes manifesting in the steady-state I-V relationships, and to (b) dynamical perturbations of 
𝑉𝑚 in Eq. 13 for response to transient changes in the local field potential, depolarizations through 
the gap-junctions, or response to transient shifts of [𝐾+]𝑜. 

Of not many disease modeling studies differentially isolating glial currents (mostly focusing on Kir), 
we looked for those where the changes would alter the monotonic I-V dependence of the total 
astrocytic current, Fig. 1. For the nature of current alterations, and the source references see Table 
A2 in Appendix 2. Sole focus on Kir currents with K2P current not being isolated has prevented 
those studies to report the impact of altered Kir current on the I-V curve of total current. The 
alterations of Kir currents summarized in Table A2 suggest that the model should consider 
asymmetrical changes of Kir conductivity in different 𝑉𝑚 ranges, either as a hallmark of a pathology 
or different functional channel expressions like in the case of heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels. 
Biophysical specificity of the Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channel is that it turns weakly rectifying Kir4.1 into a 
strong inward rectifier [45], numerically equivalent to almost fully attenuating the outward 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 
current. 

Figure 6A illustrates the trend of change in the steady-state I-V curve of the total 𝐾+ current in 
different scenarios of Kir deregulation in Table A2. A typical effect is a loss of monotonicity positive 
to +60 𝑚𝑉, where both Kir4.1 and K2P currents coexist producing a non-monotonous N-shaped I-V 
curve. In Figure 6A we sketched this effect by different attenuations of Kir inward and/or outward 
component using our model, based on the I-V graphs in different disease models, Table A2. 
Included also, the lower solid curve, is the combined effect of loss of outward Kir conductance in 
parallel with drastically increased [𝐾+]𝑜 like in cases of seizures and spreading depolarizations. To 
produce the effects in Fig. 6A we were (a) decreasing 𝑔̅𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤 for the inward range of WR-Kir current 
in the Hagiwara model, Eq. 3, and (b) doing the same using a multiplier in the GHK model, Eq. 8 for 
the outward range, due to a complex form of the conductance in 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 model. The K2P current was 
kept in the nominal range and shape. 

Figure 6 – Loss of monotonic I-V curve via alterations of Kir4.1 currents in disease 
models. (A) Alterations in Kir conductivity without changes in K2P conductance produce 
non-monotonic I-V curves. The lower solid curve illustrates the parallel effect of a drastic 
increase in external 𝐾+, while all others are obtained by amplifying or attenuating the Kir 
currents in Eq. 13, at [𝐾+]𝑜 = 5𝑚𝑀 based on the nature of deregulation in Table A2, 
Appendix 2. The labels in the legend relate each curve to the corresponding study in Table 
A2. (B) Example of nullcline analysis in (𝑉𝑚, 𝑛) plane. Increasing the constant 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡 changes 
(into an N-shape) and shifts the V-nullcline introducing a saddle fixed point 𝑉𝑆 (triangle), and 
markedly more positive stable node or focus 𝑉𝑑𝑟 via the fold bifurcation. The dotted, dashed, 
and the solid line show the changing shape of the V-nullcline with 𝐼𝑖𝑒𝑥𝑡. 

Since the typical dynamic perturbations, same as with neurons, transiently depolarize the glial 
membrane by 𝐼𝑔𝑗𝑐 or 𝐼𝑙𝑓𝑝(𝑡) currents, the principal bifurcation parameter was a constant in time 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡. 

3 Even though the experiments observe real-time channel expressions changes, those happen on time scales of minutes, 
hours or longer, which warrants keeping the corresponding parameters constant on timescales of milliseconds or seconds. 

12 

 
 
 
As a second bifurcation parameter, we varied 𝑔̅𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤 and [𝐾+]𝑜 with attenuation of 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 as a static 
perturbation of the model, so that all scenarios of impact on Kir conductivity could be implemented.  

In the 2-dimensional system, Eq. 13, using nullclines let us detect the trends of change in the phase 
portrait. As expected and previously illustrated in models of neurons very similar to Eq. 13 [19], 
chapter 5, in addition to the nominal equilibrium state 𝑉𝑟 - a stable node for 𝑉𝑚 slightly more positive 
to 𝐸𝐾, the N-shaped I-V curve introduces a second stable node via the fold bifurcation, as we vary 
𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡, Fig. 6B. The fold bifurcation is generic in 2-d models like Eq. 13 with N-shaped nonlinearity in 
the voltage4 equation and robustly observed within wide parameter ranges. We keep referring in the 
rest of the text to the nominal stable, resting state as 𝑉𝑟, and to the more depolarized, again stable 
steady-state introduced by the fold bifurcation as 𝑉𝑑𝑟.  

Figure 7 – Fold bifurcations in (𝑽𝒎, 𝒏𝑲𝟐𝑷) dynamics are generic when the perturbed model displays an N-
shaped I-V characteristic. (A) Fold bifurcation diagram of Eq. 13 for 𝑔𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤 = 0.00917 𝜇𝑆, with 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠= 0. (B) A 
cusp curve in (𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡, 𝑔𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤) plane obtained by running 2-parameter continuation from the fold point at 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡 =
0.2306 in (A). The coordinates of the corresponding stable steady states are  (𝑉𝑟 = −77.86 𝑚𝑉, 𝑛𝐾2𝑃 =
0.0964), and of the saddle-node close to (𝑉𝑑𝑟 = −9.734 𝑚𝑉, 𝑛𝐾2𝑃 = 0.6), with 𝑔𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤 kept at the same value as 
in (A). (C) The dashed line shows a typical path through the parameter plane corresponding to a membrane 
with deregulated Kir conductance perturbed by a net depolarizing current 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡. The region bounded by the 
cusp curve separates the two monostable parameter domains, the down-state domain, corresponding to the 
true nominal resting state 𝑉𝑟 (of node type), and that of the up-state, corresponding to a single depolarized 
steady state 𝑉𝑑𝑟, of focus/spiral type. For parameter values inside the transition region, within the cusp, the 
model displays two stable nodes separated by an unstable saddle point.  

Figure 7A and 7B show the fold and cusp bifurcation diagrams for changing 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡 and 𝑔𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤, with the 
outward 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 attenuated. All continuations were done using the AUTO package [46] as implemented 
within XPPAUT [47]. Examples in Fig.7A and 7B were computed with 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 = 0, though qualitatively 
the same behavior is present with 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 between zero and 15% of its intensity. All other model 
parameters were kept at the values given in Table 1, used in the fitting of steady-state I-V 
characteristics, with [𝐾+]𝑜 = 2.5 𝑚𝑀 and the glial leak 𝑔𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑘 = 0.0013 𝜇𝑆. At 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡 = 0.2306 𝑛𝐴, in Fig. 
7A the bifurcation introduces a saddle-node at 𝑉𝑑𝑟 = −9.734 𝑚𝑉, notably depolarized to the nominal  
𝑉𝑟 = −77.86 𝑚𝑉, which further splits into a saddle and stable node at 𝑉𝑑𝑟 as 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡further increases. 
The cusp curve Fig. 7B fusing fold bifurcation behavior of two parameters divides the (𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡, 𝑔𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤) 
plane in three regions: (I) the down-state represented by 𝑉𝑟, (II) the up-state represented by the 
depolarized resting voltage 𝑉𝑑𝑟 of type focus, and (III) the bistability region where 𝑉𝑚 transits 
towards either of the stable nodes, qualifying the model for switching behavior. Equations 13 
represent the first minimal ODE model of the glial membrane near 𝑉𝑟, based on whole-cell 
recordings, suggesting the existence of a stable, depolarized up-state in glial 𝑉𝑚 dynamics, within a 
wide range of parameters. 

The biological relevance of downregulating or abolishing the WR-Kir outward 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 current as a 
parametric perturbation is directly suggested by (i) electrophysiological data in several disease 
models we listed [48], [49], as well as (ii) by the specific properties of heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 
channel populations [50], [45]. The later accounts for a nonnegligible fraction of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 
channels in astrocytes in different brain regions [51], [52], [12]. The extent of deregulation of the

physical law it is the Kirchhoff’s current equation.

inward conductance of the Kir4.1 alone – a decreased slope in the I-V curve negative to 𝑉𝑟, is not 
detrimental for the observed qualitative changes since it doesn’t produce by itself the N-shaped I-V 
curve.  

The dashed line in Fig. 7C represents a typical perturbation line of Eq. 13 combining (i) permanent 
deregulation of outward conductance of WR-Kir, with (ii) changing inward WR-Kir conductance in 
experimental conditions where an astrocyte is (iii) subjected to depolarizing current input 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡. 
Slow depolarizations induced by 𝐾+accumulation in extracellular space (ECS), and subsequently 
the positive shift of 𝐸𝐾 and 𝑉𝑟 suggest that either as a parameter, a transient perturbation, or a slow 
variable in an extended 3-dimensional model, [𝐾+]𝑜 could be inducing instability of 𝑉𝑟. Since an 
extension of the system, Eq. 13 incorporating [𝐾+]𝑜 dynamics in 𝑅3or higher [53] is beyond the 
scope of this study, we verified that fold and cusp are robust in (𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡, [𝐾+]𝑜) parameter domains as 
well, with 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡 in the same range as above, and [𝐾+]𝑜 modestly raised compared to the nominal 
2.5 𝑚𝑀, Fig. 8. It is important to report that higher the [𝐾+]𝑜 much less pronounced attenuation of 
𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 produces the N-shaped curve and the fold bifurcation, (much less than 85%).

XPPAUT were computed using 𝐸𝐾 due to better 
numerical convergence.  [𝐾+]𝑜 = 4.022 𝑚𝑀 
corresponds to 𝐸𝐾 = −89.32 𝑚𝑉, for [𝐾+]𝑖 =
130 𝑚𝑀. 

Large separation of time scales between 𝑉𝑚 responses and [𝐾+]𝑜 transients, from milliseconds to 
second and minutes, warrants analyzing the basic [𝐾+]𝑜 impacts on 𝑉𝑟 stability treating it as a 
parameter in the simple 2-dimensional system, Eq. 13. 

Quantitative studies summarizing the properties of macroscopic currents through the glial Kir4.1 [54] 
and K2P-TREK channels [28], [37] suggest that apart from K2P activation there is no other channel 
kinetics critical to extend the minimal model, Eq. 13, with additional dynamical variable. Whole-cell 
Kir4.1 responses to voltage clamp commands suggested almost instantaneous activation with rising 
times of less than 2 ms. The instantaneous Kir4.1 currents, measured at 2 ms, were somewhat 
higher in the mid and outward range but not producing qualitative change in I-V curve. There is 
therefore no candidate for a resonant variable in the 2-D model, Eq. 13, [19], [55] which would 
induce a cyclic behavior in ℝ2. A word of caution is needed in this context due to the measurement 
difficulties with the leaky astrocytic membrane patches. Inability to precisely determine the input and 
access resistance of the patched astrocyte [1] makes it unreliable to compensate for the serial loss, 
which in turn always produces underestimated maxima of both, instantaneous and steady currents 
potentially compromising our judgment on the rise times in the current responses to voltage 
commands.  

3.2   Numerical simulations of the bistability and switching 

For demonstrating the switching capability we perturbed the model, Eq. 13, using time series from 
recordings of glial depolarization during electrographic seizures induced by transient elevation of 
[𝐾+]𝑜 [9]. The glial 𝑉𝑚 was recorded using two-electrode in-situ protocol on glial membrane in 
rodent hippocampal slices. 

Figure 9, (upper trace) shows a sample of glial depolarization Δ𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡 in response to neuronal seizure, 
Fig. 11A in [9], digitized from a printed image using the Graph Grabber tool [56]. Such signal 
features: (i) a fast depolarizing, tonic transient of Δ𝑉𝑚 ≈ 20𝑚𝑉 within initial ten seconds, followed by 
(ii) pseudo-periodic clonic episodes lasting in total for nearly 60 seconds. To use the Δ𝑉𝑙𝑓𝑝 recording 
as a perturbing signal in our model we needed somewhat realistic time course of the corresponding 

14 

 
 
𝛥𝐸𝐾(𝑡) shift, for which purpose we used Δ𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡−𝑑𝑐 averaged signal of 27 seizure events (from 5 cells) 
from the same study [9] see Fig. 10A, plotted as a lower curve in Figure 9 below, so that for a 
realistic example of 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡 in Eq. 14 we get: 

𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡(𝑡) = 𝐼𝑔𝑗𝑐 + 𝐼𝑙𝑓𝑝(𝑡) =   𝐼𝑔𝑗𝑐 + 𝑔𝑙𝑓𝑝Δ𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡(𝑡)     (𝑛𝐴) 
𝐸𝐾(𝑡) = 𝐸𝐾 + Δ𝐸𝐾(𝑡) ≈ 𝐸𝐾 + Δ𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡−𝑑𝑐(𝑡)      (𝑚𝑉) 
𝛥𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡(𝑡) = 𝑉𝑔𝑙𝑖𝑎(𝑡) − 𝑉𝑙𝑓𝑝(𝑡);   Δ𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡−𝑑𝑐 = 〈Δ𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡〉 − 〈Δ𝑉𝑙𝑓𝑝〉     (𝑚𝑉). 

(15) 

The 𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡(𝑡) signals were measured with a reference to a distant ground in the bath and should be 
referenced to the LFP level immediately adjacent to the cell measured the same way [9]. That 
correction averaged at 3 mV, was omitted in the final simulations since it produced no difference 
and would in principle cancel out in (𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡 − 𝐸𝐾) if such control measurement of externally generated 
driving force existed.  

Perturbation signals as in Eq. 15 mimic a transient depolarization event of a hippocampal glial cell in 
situ - depolarized by a positive, outward current resulting from sustained seizure-like discharges 
invading the surrounding neurons in a larger region, slowly and transiently elevating, and restoring 
the nominal [𝐾+]𝑜 during 72.6 seconds. We do not use it to simulate bath application of a constant 
elevated [𝐾+]𝑜 in [9], but try to simulate more realistic transient depolarization which in reality 
comes with transiently altered local Δ𝐸𝐾(𝑡). 
Figure 9 – Transient glial depolarization signals – 
Depolarization transient Δ𝑉𝑙𝑓𝑝 from resting (upper 
trace) measured on glial soma in situ, in response to 
an electrographic seizure initiated by increased 
[𝐾+]𝑜 to 8.5 mM, in a rat hippocampal slice. A two-
electrode protocol was used with a reference 
electrode in the bath. Δ𝑉𝑙𝑓𝑝−𝑑𝑐 (lower trace) is an 
average of 135 depolarizing episodes, recorded 
from 5 cells, used to approximate the shift of the 
Nernstian potential Δ𝐸𝐾(𝑡) due to 𝐾+ accumulation.  

We find Δ𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡−𝑑𝑐 to be a good example of Δ𝐸𝐾(𝑡) transient assuming it represents an average of 
LFP events that (a) in reality are subjected to low-pass filtering of the ECS [57] which will reduce 
them to the slower timescales typical for gradual [𝐾+]𝑜 changes, and (b) are of common shape in 
the initial steady depolarization phase, time-aligned at the onset. Its maximal amplitude of 12.8 𝑚𝑉 
is close to the Nernstian Δ𝐸𝐾 = 13.7 𝑚𝑉, for a relative shift from [𝐾+]𝑜 at the nominal 5 mM in our 
data (the nominal I-V relations in the model), to 8.5 mM bath concentration robustly producing the 
seizures [9]. The slower rise time in the initial 10 seconds, as well as the steady decay of the 
averaged Δ𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡−𝑑𝑐(𝑡) probably reflect the joint action of the Na-K pump and other restorative 
mechanisms of ion homeostasis. Such Δ𝐸𝐾(𝑡) is therefore a safe approximation for low to moderate 
[𝐾+]𝑜 increases on the timescale of seconds, even a more conservative one, producing slightly less 
depolarized 𝐸𝐾 shifts if we start from a baseline of 2.5 𝑚𝑀 of external 𝐾+. Unspecific conductance 
𝑔𝑙𝑓𝑝was introduced to convert the transient voltage perturbation Δ𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡(𝑡) into current perturbation 
signal in Eq. 15. Indicative value range of 𝑔𝑙𝑓𝑝was set between 0.01 ÷ 0.016 𝜇𝑆 to keep the total 
𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡(𝑡) in simulations within the range of the fold bifurcation diagram, Fig. 7A, matching the dynamic 
range of the clonic discharges in Δ𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡 of 5 ÷ 10 𝑚𝑉, from 𝑡 = 10 𝑠 onwards, Fig. 9.  
A simulated example of switching behavior in response to the above perturbing transients is 
illustrated in Figure 10. We observed two qualitative behaviors depending on 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 attenuation and 
𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡 and 𝑔𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤 value ranges. With fully abolished outward 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠, constant 𝐼𝑔𝑗𝑐 = 0.125 𝑛𝐴 and 
nominal 𝑔𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤 = 0.00917 𝜇𝑆 at [𝐾+]𝑜 = 2.5 𝑚𝑀, Fig. 10A shows a series of plateau responses on 
Δ𝑉𝑒𝑥𝑡 from Fig. 9, with 0.01 ≤ 𝑔𝑙𝑓𝑝 ≤ 0.017. With increasing 𝑔𝑙𝑓𝑝the response switched from the 
downstate to the upstate in a threshold manner – from partially to fully. With 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 attenuated to 15% 

15 

 
 
of its amplitude, a more erratic switching profile without prolonged upstate was a typical response, 
shown in Fig. 10B with the other parameters kept the same.  

Figure 10 – Glial switching on transient seizure-like perturbation – (A) Simulations of the full model 𝑉𝑚 response on 
electrographic seizure, Fig. 9, with fully abolished Kir outward 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 current and increasing 𝑔𝑙𝑓𝑝 show plateau switching 
between downstate and upstate, corresponding to 𝑉𝑟 and 𝑉𝑑𝑟. (B)  The same simulation, with 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 amplitude reduced to 
15%, demonstrating an irregular, erratic switching with a frequency following that of the clonic phase of seizure signal. The 
presence of 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 shifts both  𝑉𝑟 and 𝑉𝑑𝑟 slightly more negative. A constant level of external current through gap junctions 
was kept at 𝐼𝑔𝑗𝑐 = 0.125 𝑛𝐴 and the slope of Kir inward conductance was held at the nominal 𝑔𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤 = 0.00917 𝜇𝑆. 

Decreasing Kir inward current, via 𝑔𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑤 led to more pronounced instability and more frequent 
switching in either profile for lower transfer conductance 𝑔𝑙𝑓𝑝, see Figure S1 in Supplementary 
Information. No particular, numerical sensitivity in any of the parameters was observed indicating a 
more peculiar singular behavior, in dynamical terms.   

4.  Discussion / I ~ importance, S – significance, N – novelty, U - utility / 

The observed dynamical instability could point to different areas of impact depending on the 
physical model system and the specific 𝑉𝑚 dependence of the modeled phenomenon. A general 
conclusion in hypothesis-free terms would be that with its very basic ion channel composition the 
glial membrane responds differently and distinctly to external depolarizations when Kir or 
combinations of Kir and K2P conductances are deregulated, due to the interplay of Ohmic and 
complex non-Ohmic conductances, nonlinear in 𝑉𝑚. Below, we discuss the possible implications of 
the presented biophysics from several different neurobiological perspectives.  

4.1 

On the model 

(I1) Numerous biological association studies have related, put in context the changes in expression 
of Kir4.1 currents and the biophysical properties of measured currents to the altered function of glia. 
In translating such changes into specific roles of the cell, it has remained elusive which mechanisms 
could transduce the molecular changes into a whole-cell voltage response. We modeled 𝑉𝑚 
dynamic of an isolated astrocyte by a minimal ODE model incorporating the major 𝐾+conductances, 
WR-Kir and K2P, and a leak current to explore the direct effect of nonlinear changes in the total 
astrocytic ion conductance to 𝑉𝑚 dynamics. In other words, it models the simplest form of 
modulation of 𝑉𝑚 by alterations of ion conductances with no other signal transductions being 
modeled, like membrane mechano-sensitivity, pH sensitivity, actions of physiological agonists, etc. 
The model, Eq. 13, let us ask the typical question - which nature of (de)regulation of the 
conductances impacts the stability of the nominal resting state 𝑉𝑟, which in turn controls all 
electrogenic transport mechanisms.    

(I2) Decades of conductance-based models suggest that even very small currents need careful 
consideration since the nonlinear interplay of their conductances could impact the stability of the 
resting state and in turn the cell response [19]. That has motivated the incorporation of the K2P 
current through its activation dynamics, 𝑛(𝑡), as a second dynamical variable.  

16 

 
 
The major perturbations of the baseline model came from decreased Kir conductance in the 
outward 𝑉𝑚 range, with K2P conductance remaining unchanged or eventually increased, resulting in 
a non-monotonic steady-state I-V curve. (N1) In that regard we present the first ODE model of glial 
𝑉𝑚, Eq. 13 which incorporates two distinct and differentially regulated 𝐾+currents, in addition to the 
unspecific 𝐾+leak current, based on recordings from isolated cells.  

(S1) Non-monotonous, N-shaped I-V relation produced by a prominent decrease of WR-Kir in the 
outward range, gives birth to a new, more depolarized stable steady state 𝑉𝑑𝑟 for physiological 
average external depolarizing current, 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡. When present, such a mathematical feature of a model 
of a non-excitable cell is generic and observed robustly in a wider parameter range, Fig. 7. We 
argue here that the emergence of a distinct and stable 𝑉𝑑𝑟 introduces a specific and distinctive 
transition - translating the loss of pseudo-Ohmic, linear behavior of the membrane into a bistable 
switch when exposed to depolarizing transients, Fig. 9. Bistabile switches with or without hysteresis 
are pervasive and diverse in biological systems since those are the simplest outcomes of 
instabilities of the resting state [58]. An elegant analytical model of the same form of bistability in 
hypokalemic skeletal muscle is presented in [59]. 

To simulate the switching between 𝑉𝑟 and 𝑉𝑑𝑟 using a perturbation specific to the repertoire of real 
glial cells we used a seizure-like transient recorded on glia rather than a ramp or constant 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡, since 
glial cells in real circuits do not receive prolonged depolarizations by constant external currents. We 
believe the chosen electrographic seizure has a typical waveform for a wider range of strong 
transient depolarizations resulting from coherent discharges of hippocampal neurons. 

In modeling open, background Kir channels we departed from the typical modeling approach, a 
single current – single biophysical description. The reversal of polarity of the driving force changes 
the nature of the physiological block resulting in qualitatively different pseudo-gating in the WR-Kir 
pore for inward and outward flux (Appendix A). This assumption warrants the use two different 
biophysical descriptions for additive inward and outward fluxes. Figure 3 suggests that this 
conceptual approach results in an overlapping 𝑉𝑚regions where both mechanisms (blue and red 
curve in Fig.3) produce a small outward current. Those outward permeation events happen for very 
small Δ𝑉𝑚 where the electrical enthalpic contributions are comparable to the fluctuations – resulting 
in outward pseudo-gating in the central cavity, as well as within the SF, described respectively by 
the Hagiwara model, and by the nonconstant-field GHK equation, Eq. 5. Such different gating 
scenarios require several effective charge valences 𝑧𝑖𝑛𝑤, 𝑧𝐵, and 𝑧 to appear within descriptions of 
WR-Kir current. The equivalence of the form of nonconstant-field GHK model of 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠, Eq. 8, and the 
basic form of rate model based on simplified Eyring’s formalism with a single, centered, and 
symmetrical barrier [42], together with the attempts to relate Hagiwara’s model to multi-barrier 
Eyring model [60] suggest at least an opportunity to consider bringing the proposed separate 
models of WR-Kir inward and outward fluxes under a more coherent formalism.    

(N2) Departing from the constant field assumption in the Nernst-Planck formalism of an open pore, 
results in a modified Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation which allows incorporating simple 
forms of nonlinear energy profiles within the pore, as long as the integral in the current equation is 
solvable [27]. We applied it for the first time to describe the outward component of WR-Kir current, 
Eq. 8, and by extending it with quadratic dependence of the barrier peak, Eq. 7, the observed 
current saturation with voltage was captured by the model, Fig. 4. Accumulating evidence of 
complex gating in open pores, lacking a voltage-sensitive gate, may qualify this approach in a wide 
range of leaky channels.  
Preliminary extension of Eq. 13 we attempted with [𝐾+]𝑜 dynamics [53], [61], [62] in a very 
simplified, spatially constrained ECS compartment demonstrated an enriched dynamical repertoire 
of the model and will be reported in another study. Within [𝐾+]𝑜 ranges indicating the richer 
bifurcation repertoire in [53] and [63], we observed some entrainment of the glial 𝑉𝑚 in Eq. 13 by the 
[𝐾+]𝑜dynamics driven by a coupled neuronal bursting [53], but those require more precise 
dynamical characterization. Other important extensions of the model should include (a) 
incorporating the chloride conductances explicitly and (b) adding mechanosensitivity to K2P 
conductances to simulate the osmolar stress of the membrane. 

17 

Very limited availability of transient recordings from glia leaves us without traces of real-time 
perturbations of glial 𝑉𝑚 on different time scales which is a limiting factor to considering a non-
autonomous, driven ODE in the model Eq. 13, since in immediate proximity of spiking neurons the 
glial cells are never in a true voltage steady state. An isolated astrocyte is not a biological reality but 
has been an experimental and modeling target system for detecting and describing the baseline cell 
properties. The heavily interconnected glial cells in the glial cell continuum require testing any 
indications of 𝑉𝑚 multistability using spatially extended models in the light of experimentally 
observed 𝑉𝑚 isopotentiality [64] – a tendency of interconnected glia to quench any marked 
depolarization. 

4.2 

On the instability and glia 

(S2), (N3) Translating 𝑉𝑚 bistability and altered WR-Kir current into effects significant for the whole 
cell function, the following impacts are directly implicated by the model: 

o  Depolarized resting state 𝑽𝒅𝒓 as a catastrophic event5 – Even though it is one of the 
simplest instability scenarios, the birth of a stable, very depolarized resting state is 
potentially catastrophic since switching to 𝑉𝑑𝑟 > −10 𝑚𝑉 is taking the membrane and the 
cell, to a state with much higher potential energy than the nominal hyperpolarized resting 
state, not corresponding to the actual [𝐾+]𝑜. Prolonged depolarization of the glial 
membrane around 𝑉𝑑𝑟 would impact all glial functions, from metabolic support to membrane 
transport, and practically all neuromodulatory roles assigned to glia.  

o 

(I3) Voltage switching between 𝑽𝒓 and 𝑽𝒅𝒓 disrupts the kinetics of active transport 
mechanisms - Since all major electrogenic pumps and transporters show some extent of 
voltage dependence [68], [69], [70], the depolarized 𝑉𝑑𝑟, or the up-state should violate the 
assumptions made for the steady-state transport rates near 𝑉𝑟. In the case of ATP-driven 
pumps, in the Na-K pump, for example, all simplified descriptions used in computational 
models, in a form of a simple current generator 𝐼𝑝𝑢𝑚𝑝 = 𝜌𝑓([𝐾+]𝑜, [𝑁𝑎+]𝑖) focusing on the 
“acceleration” term 𝑓 which models the sensitivity to ion concentration changes, are 
warranted by the existence of a constant steady-state rate 𝜌, assumed to be voltage-
independent. When 𝑉𝑚 switches to 𝑉𝑑𝑟 > −10 𝑚𝑉, dramatically shifted Δ𝑉𝑚 to large positive 
values impacts some of the binding and translocation steps in the kinetic model of the 
pump and questions the biophysical plausibility of keeping 𝜌 constant. In particular, where 
the perturbing voltage transients like the electrographic seizure we used, produce a jump 
near 𝑉𝑑𝑟 not resulting from moderately elevated [𝐾+]𝑜, i.e., 𝐸𝐾 not much above 𝑉𝑟, a large 
and lasting positive transient is produced. If further studies prove the bistability in 𝑉𝑚 is 
electrophysiologically plausible, moving to a more detailed macroscopic model of the pump 
might be required with 𝜌 explicitly depending on the full form of the electrochemical 
potential. For the pump rate 𝜌 in units of molar flux, we can write [69]: 

𝜌 ~ Δ𝐺 + Δ𝜇̃𝐻  (𝑚𝑀/𝑠),   where Δ𝜇̃𝐻 = Δ𝜇 + 𝑧𝐹𝑉𝑚  (𝑅𝑇 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑠), 

𝑅𝑇 ln(𝑐𝑒𝑥𝑡 𝑐𝑖𝑛⁄

) + 𝑧𝐹𝑉𝑚 < −Δ𝐺,  for active transport, 

(16) 

) and the electrical part 𝑧𝐹𝑉𝑚 that impacts 𝜌 under prolonged depolarization 

where Δ𝐺 represents the purely chemical potential energy from ATP hydrolysis, and within 
the electrochemical part Δ𝜇̃𝐻 we recognize the Nernstian, or osmolar contribution Δ𝜇 =
𝑅𝑇 ln (𝑐𝑒𝑥𝑡 𝑐𝑖𝑛⁄
at 𝑉𝑑𝑟. An implicit assumption not typically discussed is that only near the nominal 
equilibrium 𝑉𝑟 where the electrochemical gradient Δ𝑉𝑚 is small and the osmolar contribution 
large and steady, the 𝐹𝑉𝑚 term could be eventually neglected. The inequality in Eq. 16 is 
the typical condition for a sustained primary active transport, with sign convention in −Δ𝐺 
representing the amount of free energy available from hydrolysis of a mole ATP, rather 

5 We use the term in the context of the catastrophe theory of dynamical systems [65], [66] and catastrophic bifurcations 
[67], initially formulated over the impact of the same instability we observed - the fold bifurcation, on the global behavior of 
both, natural and man-made systems.

than the barrier height in the enzymatic reaction [71], [69]. Some variants of the 
macroscopic model of the pump have kept the voltage dependence [72] and have 
produced effects in whole-cell dynamics attributable to the Na-K pump. In such models, the 
eventual effects of voltage bistability could be directly tested. Stoichiometry coefficients 
have been omitted in Eq. 16 for simplicity.  
− cotransporter (NBCe1) specifically 
The electrogenic sodium bicarbonate 𝑁𝑎+/𝐻𝐶𝑂3
implicated in glial metabolic and other functions, is another important candidate to be 
analyzed in the context of bistability since the reversal of the polarity of Δ𝑉𝑚 would cause 
switching of the transport direction and in turn the pH modulation of the cell between 
alkalization and acidification, and consequently of the immediate extracellular environment 
[7].  
Of the other transporters potentially “vulnerable” to bistability let us mention the astrocytic 
GABA transporters (GAT1-GAT3) expressed in local cortical circuits [73], [74], modeled 
macroscopically as explicitly 𝑉𝑚 dependent [75]. 
(I4),(S3) Switching between the two resting states may introduce erratic transients in 
trans-junctional voltage over the GJCs – It has been shown that the conductance and 
rectification of GJCs are dependent on the trans-junctional voltage 𝑉𝐽 between the 
connected cells across a wide range of the Connexin isoforms [76], [77], [78], and 
specifically for the Connexin43 hemichannels, one of the two most abundant subtypes 
assembling the astrocytic GJCs, with Connexin30 [79]. Due to the nonlinear steady-state I-V 
relationship and the nonlinear 𝑔𝑔𝑗𝑐(𝑉𝐽) in a wider 𝑉𝐽 range in most GJCs [80], [81], the 
complex two-stage gating of the hemichannels may result in erratic behavior of the GJC if 
the connected cells are prone to switching between markedly separated 𝑉𝑟 and 𝑉𝑑𝑟. The 
notable difference between the instantaneous and steady 𝑔𝑔𝑗𝑐(𝑉𝐽) [77], introdcues another 
major uncertanity in the eventual models [81]. The origin of such uncertainty between the 
residual and fully conductive conformations could be in principle justified by an atomic level 
model of GJC electrostatics [82] suggesting complex Coulombic profiles, potentially 
vulnerable to erratic voltage transients. 
(I5), (S4) Glial encoding of [𝑲+]𝒐 variations as a signal gets a distinct state – In the 
present understanding of the encoding capability of glial membrane, the glial 𝑉𝑚 with certain 
low-pass filtering capability (with τm = 𝐶𝑒𝑓𝑓/𝑔𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 ≈ 10𝑚𝑠 for 20pF patch capacitance) close 
to linearly encodes [𝐾+]𝑜variations as a signal through (𝑉𝑚 − 𝐸𝐾).  We can also say 𝐸𝐾 itself 
smooth out the real-time 𝐾+ variations from neuronal discharging partly due to the low-pass 
filtering of the ECS to volume transmission signals [57] and partly due to the log (𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑡  𝑐𝑖𝑛⁄
nature of Nernstian dependence. The emergence of 𝑉𝑑𝑟 introduces therefore a distinct, 
depolarized state potentially detectable on various timescales by a suitable measurement 
setup. In other words, 𝑉𝑟 and 𝑉𝑑𝑟 encode (a) an almost linear potassium electrode, and (b) a 
deformed, N-shaped I-V relationship of deregulated conductance(s), respectively, Fig. 6A.

The presumed ion-homeostatic role of Kir4.1 in glia was not discussed in the context of bistability 
because the differential contributions of the different ion transport mechanisms are still elusive [83], 
and a reasonably reduced mathematical model addressing the spatial complexity of volume 
transmission in neuroglial circuits requires a dedicated experimental study for detecting the ranges 
of those parameters critical to the ion homeostatic effects. 

In summary, the proposed minimal 2-dimensional model of the interplay between WR-Kir and K2P 
currents in astrocytic membrane shows that deregulations turning WR-Kir current into inwardly 
rectified, robustly produce a second very depolarized steady state of 𝑉𝑚 and a whole-cell behavior 
considered markedly non-physiological within glial biology. To prove or refute such bistability as 
neurobiologically plausible, a measurement protocol well suited for transient 𝑉𝑚 changes would be 
needed, probably employing voltage imaging, a dynamic (current) clamp, and cell assays displaying 
deregulated Kir4.1 or sufficient densities of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels of glial origin. 

19 

(U1) The proposed model, Eq. 13, is of general biophysical utility, directly applicable to the interplay 
between Kir and K2P currents in membranes of other systems where K2P channel variants display 
nonnegligible activation kinetics, like in the heart and kidneys, see [18] for more cases. Bistability 
showing comparable voltage separation of 𝑉𝑟 and 𝑉𝑑𝑟 like presented has been already observed in 
cardiomyocytes in hypokalemic conditions [14], where strongly-rectifying Kir2.1 channels interwork 
with the linear K2P-TWIK channels.

Short-pore model of WR-Kir channel and physiological 𝑴𝒈𝟐+block 
Appendix-1  
We base our model of Kir current on (i) 𝐾+conduction through a short pore (Fig. A1), common to all 
𝐾+channels - confined to the part of the transmembrane structure, consisting of a selectivity filter 
(SF) extending into the internal water-filled central cavity [84], [85] and on (ii) physiological blocking 
of the pore by cytoplasmic cations as a permeability modulation mechanism. Coulombic interactions 
within the short pore are therefore used to explain the permeation mechanisms as an interaction 
between the blocking 𝑀𝑔2+and permeant 𝐾+ions, as a basis for a weak rectification. Unlike in 
strong inward rectification, where both, the internal 𝑀𝑔2+and/or polyamines fully block outward flux 
[34], [86], in the outward permeation scenario of a weakly rectifying pore (Fig. A1C) the partial and 
flickering block allows the entrance of permeant ions into the SF and modulates their 
electrodiffusion at high rates. This pore model is crucial for explaining the anomalous, inward 
rectification of Kir conductances, which can’t be described by Nernst-Planck (NP) formalism based 
on electrochemical gradients over open, leaky channels. The short pore model applied to outward 
conduction in WR-Kir channels, allows extending the NP model with a non-constant field and in turn 
a voltage-dependent permeability, equation (9), under the assumptions of a changing Coulombic 
profile with voltage. These extensions formulate the main assumptions of the 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑠 model [27]. 
In line with the above assumptions, recent evidence from single-channel recordings and molecular 
dynamics simulations of the potassium KcsA pore [87] suggests that the voltage and ligands induce 
structural fluctuation changes within the electrostatics, Coulombic profile of SF which produces a 
universal pseudo-gating of an open pore at SF, without introducing a conformational change and 
gating.

Figure A1 - Short pore model of permeation through generic weakly-rectifying Kir channels – (A) A short-
pore view of the Kir pore consisting of a selectivity filter (SF) and the inner, water-filled central cavity. The sketch 
shows the sources of electrostatic interaction along with the transmembrane structure acting on permeant and 
blocking ions, modified from [88]. Inside the SF, selectivity filter dipoles create binding sites (S1 to S4), 
corresponding to energy wells where permeant ions are stabilized between the transitions. (B) and (C), A 
simplified one-dimensional view of the short pore showing the different voltage dependence of the 𝑀𝑔2+ block 
and the Coulombic interaction with the permeant ions. From negative to positive Δ𝑉𝑚 = (𝑉𝑚 − 𝐸𝐾𝑖𝑟), and constant 
or slowly varying [𝐾+]𝑜, the resulting force on 𝑀𝑔2+and 𝐾+ions changes and the resulting blocking events are 
qualitatively different, see text for details. Arrows show the direction of the electrical field 𝐸̅ on a positive ion along 
the reaction coordinate. We assign a unitary length 𝑙𝑆𝑃 (shown in C) to the extent of the pore over which we 
model potential energy landscape. Dashed circles around the ions in (B) and (C) represent the full or partial 
hydration shells. The length of the SF without the outer vestibule in (B) and (C) is disproportionally shorter than in 
(A), to keep the image compact.  

The short-pore model assumes the concentration of 𝑀𝑔2+and 𝐾+within the central cavity and at the 
external pore vestibule, correspond to the physiological intracellular and extracellular bath 
concentrations respectively. Local, relative, nonequilibrium concentration changes due to effects like 
the attraction of cations by rings of negatively charged residues, in vestibules on either side of the 
SF entrance, are neglected.  

To describe both, the inward and outward permeation, we assume that the transmembrane voltage 
𝑉𝑚 drops over the whole short pore - over the whole cavity and the SF, but the fraction 𝛿 introduced 
in Eq. 7 reduces it to 𝛿Δ𝑉𝑚 influencing with a smaller fraction the middle of the pore and S5 position 
where the outward barrier is centered, as marked in Fig. 3B. For completeness, the S0 position (not 
shown in Fig. A1B and A1C) would be just outside the SF, in the outer vestibule. This is a similar 
approach to the one used in permeation studies of weak rectification in renal Kir1.1 / ROMK1 [89, 
90]. This pore model suggests that the blocking cation moves between two modulatory sites [91] 
depending on 𝛥𝑉𝑚 polarity, thereby defining the main rectification barrier(s).  
Inward pseudo gating - For negative and very small positive net driving forces Δ𝑉𝑚, (Fig. A1B), the 
resulting electrostatics from pore helix macro dipoles keeps blocking 𝑀𝑔2+ions within the cavity 
(designated by position S6), so that the inward rectification results from a competition of permeant 
𝐾+ and 𝑀𝑔2+ ions for the central, axial positions within the cavity. Even though Δ𝑉𝑚 influences S6 
position with a much smaller fraction, not exceeding 𝛿Δ𝑉𝑚 (Fig. 3) the dependence of inward flux on 
𝑉𝑚 for Δ𝑉𝑚 < 0 is still exerted on the 𝐾+ion in S6 through the multi-ion file within SF (binding 
positions S1 to S4), which contributes to the resulting Coulombic forces and ion-crowding within the 
central cavity (represented by S5 and S6 positions). By resulting force, in this simplified view, we 
mean Coulombic repulsion between the permeant ions acting in parallel to the stabilizing attractive 
force on them coming from the negative end of pore helix macro dipoles (Fig. A1A), tilted so to 
make the center of the cavity electrostatically favorable point for a cation [26]. Hagiwara’s model of 
the macroscopic inwardly rectified Kir currents assumes the existence of equilibrium pore-open 
probabilities of inward permeation suggesting a Boltzmann term in Eq. 3 for describing the 
macroscopic conductance (rather than barrier crossing rates), analogous to the open and closed 
probabilities in gated ion channels, see [34] for Kir-specific review.

Outward pseudo gating - In the reverse case, for a more positive driving force 𝑉𝑚 > −50𝑚𝑉 (Fig. 
A1C), an outwardly directed net driving force acts on permeant and blocking cations, pushing partly 
or fully dehydrated 𝑀𝑔2+ion towards the entry of the SF, which results in a partial flickering plug of 
the pore at the S5 site. Blocking ion at S5 in conjunction with the hydrophobic repulsion at SF entry 
creates an ion association or entry barrier to the permeant 𝐾+ion, 2𝜆 wide in units of fractional 
electrical distance, Fig 3B, extending through S4 and S3 positions, Fig. A1C.  

The different nature of the resulting electrostatics in these two cases implicates different permeation 
mechanisms and warrants the use of a different biophysical description of unidirectional fluxes. We, 
therefore, model the unidirectional fluxes as additive over the whole 𝑉𝑚 range of the measured 
Kir4.1 current. In other words, the proposed modeling approach suggests that in its structure-
function a weak rectifier results as a superposition of inward and outward rectifiers. Single mutation 
studies [22], [92] suggested their structural determinants are very similar, whereas a single point 
mutation flips the pore from a strong Kir2.1 to a weak Kir1.1 rectifier.

Table 2 – Selection of studies where quantitative alteration of the macroscopic Kir current in electro-
physiological recordings has been reported, and some form of identification of weakly rectified Kir4.1 or 
inwardly rectified Kir4.1/Kir5.1 has been elaborated. Many more disease models have reported some 
association of model phenotypes to Kir channels in astrocytes, but differential quantitation of the macroscopic 
currents or conductances on a single cell has not been among the study objectives.
