The eﬀects of perturbation of a weak periodic signal (WPS) assisted by noise or a high frequency
signal (HFS) respectively on an excitable uni-junction transistor relaxation oscillator (UJT-RO)
is presented here. When the perturbation by a WPS modulated with the noise is optimum, the
UJT-RO has been observed to produce regular dynamics that mimics the WPS maximum, which
is termed as stochastic resonance (SR). Interestingly, when the noise component is replaced by a
HFS, the system shows the same SR kind of behavior, which is called vibrational resonance (VR).
Here the system produces the dynamics that mimics the WPS resembling the SR assisted by the
optimum level of HFS. Both SR and VR have been conﬁrmed through PSPICE simulation. The
results show that the regular dynamics that mimics the WPS in case of HFS modulation is better
than the noise perturbation.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The study of the noise-induced phenomena in an ex-
citable [1, 2] or bistable [3, 4] systems has received con-
siderable attention, as there is a possibility to detect low
level signals in such system with the help of noise per-
turbation [5, 6]. The counter-intuitive view of improving
the response of a system to an external force has several
manifestations. It is observed that when such perturba-
tion is purely noise, it gives rise to coherence resonance
(CR) [1, 7–9]. It is well known that perturbation enforced
by a weak periodic signal (WPS) modulated with noise
produces stochastic resonance (SR) [10–12]. Such phe-
nomena have brought about a major change in the out-
look of the eﬀect of noise in several scientiﬁc ﬁeld [13].
The main characteristic of a SR is that the system re-
sponse to a WPS reaches a maximum at an optimal level
of noise [14–16]. Conﬁrmation of SR has been demon-
strated in various nonlinear systems theoretically [17–19]
as well as experimentally [20–22]. The SR like phenom-
ena can also be reproduced with a high frequency sig-
nal (HFS) perturbation substituting the noise. The phe-
nomenon of improvement of system dynamics, induced
by the optimum level of a HFS in presence of a WPS,
is called vibrational resonance (VR) [23]. VR has been
demonstrated in various system both theoretically [3] and
experimentally [24–27].

Most of the noise or HFS-invoked phenomena can be
observed in the excitable systems under suitable para-
metric conditions [1, 2, 28]. The main characteristic of
an excitable system is that it has an internal threshold
depending on certain important parameter(s), and the
threshold must be crossed in response to an external

perturbation to excite the system dynamics. The ex-
citability is usually achieved by setting the parameter(s)
so that the system remains close to the threshold. Exter-
nal perturbation by noise at excitable state produces the
dynamics that mimics the characteristic of the system
is called CR. When the system is perturbed by a WPS
along with noise, it produces SR. On a similar note, VR
can be obtained, when the noise is replaced by HFS. In
both SR and VR phenomena, the WPS helps the system
to cross the threshold periodically to obtain periodic os-
cillatory or spiky dynamics that mimics the WPS [29].

In this paper, we present the experimental evidence
and characterization of the phenomena of the SR and VR
in a uni-junction transistor relaxation oscillator (UJT-
RO) [1, 6]. These phenomena have also been reproduced
by PSPICE simulation using multisim, and the simu-
lation results are very much in agreement with experi-
mental results. The UJT-RO is a well-known excitable
system, which can be used to study the noise-invoked
phenomena [1, 6].
It is observed that excitability in a
UJT-RO can be obtained by setting base to emitter volt-
age, VBE = 3.2 V . The detailed experimental conditions
have been discuss in Sec. II.

In this work we have experimentally demonstrated the
existance of both SR and VR in UJT-RO and the same
is conﬁrmed by PSPICE simulation using multisim. Rest
of the paper has been organized as follows: The experi-
ment and autonomous dynamics is presented in Sec. II,
experimental and simulation results have been presented
in Sec. III, and ﬁnally a conclusion has been drawn in
Sec. IV.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND
AUTONOMOUS DYNAMICS

Experiments have been performed to demonstrate SR
and VR using UJT-RO, which contains 2N2646-UJT.

FIG. 1. Circuit Description of the UJT Relaxation Oscillator

The WPS and HFS used in the experiments have been
generated by using 33500B Agilent signal generators,
which are connected to UJT-RO through a 0.1 µF ca-
pacitor to the circuit as shown in Fig. 1. The re-
sponse of the system, which is the voltage across the
base (VBO), has been recorded by a DPO 3054 Tek-
tronix digital oscilloscope. We have chosen the following
set of values for capacitors and resistors in our experi-
ments: R1 = 100 kΩ (variable resistance), R2 = 470 Ω,
R3 = 390 Ω, C1 = 0.1 µF, C2 = 0.1 µF, with a toler-
ance of 5% for all the components as shown in Fig. 1.
In the present experiments, the UJT-RO was operated
at VBB = 5V . Depending on the voltage (VE), periodic
oscillation were observed, and the output at the point B
(VBO) was recorded in the oscilloscope. Here, VE acts
as a control parameter, which was varied by using a vari-
able resistance (R1). The detailed of the autonomous
dynamics of UJT-RO has been presented in Ref. [1].

The frequency and amplitude of the WPS were con-
sidered to be f = 100 Hz and 100 mV respectively. The
bandwidth of the noise was set at 200 kHz. Frequency of
the HFS was kept at 200 kHz, which is much higher than
the frequency of the WPS as well as that of the charac-
teristic frequency of the system. Frequency of the HFS
was chosen such that there is no possibility of the system
getting excited by the HFS perturbation alone. A square
pulse of width, 10 ns was used as a WPS for the VR
experiment. The modulated amplitude of the noise and
HFS acted as a perturbation on the control parameter
for both SR and VR experiments. The base voltage was

chosen in such a way that the system remains at its ex-
citable state after application of the WPS in both cases.
On application of certain level of noise or HFS, system
started to show the desired dynamics. The detailed ex-
perimental results obtained from the experiments have
been presented in the next Section [Sec. III].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

Stochastic resonance (SR) and vibrational resonance
(VR) phenomena are observed experimentally in a UJT-
RO experiment. The eﬀects of noise and HFS on the
non-linear system have been presented below.

A. Eﬀect of noise on nonlinear system: Stochastic
resonance

Figs. 2(a)- 2(c) show the time series of the output
(VBO), taken from the base terminal (B) of the UJT-RO
for diﬀerent noise levels. Fig. 2(d) represents the absolute
mean diﬀerence (AMD) as a function of noise amplitude
in mV. AMD has been used to quantify the information
transferred from sub-threshold signal to system response.
AMD is deﬁned as, AM D = abs[mean(tp/δ − 1)], where
tp is the inter-peak interval of the response signal and δ
is the mean peak interval of the sub-threshold signal. We
have applied a WPS of amplitude 20 mV to the emitter
terminal as shown in Fig. 1. The value of AMD=1.5 as

shown in the Fig. 2(d) corresponds to noise of amplitude
48 mV, and the corresponding time series is shown in
Fig. 2(a). In such noise value, the activation threshold
is seldom crossed, and a random spike sequence is gen-
erated as shown in Fig. 2(a). As we increase the noise
amplitude, the value of AMD decreases [Fig. 2(d)], and
reaches a minimum (almost zero) at a noise level of 100
mV. The corresponding time series has been shown in
Fig. 2(b). The minimum of the AMD in Fig. 2(d) shows
that the response of the system is optimum around this
region. It indicates a maximum regularity or uniformity
has been achieved in the dynamics. The maximum de-
tection of WPS is possible around the minimum of the
AMD. Further increase in the noise intensity destroys
the regularity of the time series, that is evident from the
increase in value of AMD. Irregular time series at high
noise level has been observed as shown in Fig. 2(c). From
Fig. 2(c) it is clear that irregularity or noise dominates
the system dynamics. The production of regular dynam-
ics at optimum level of noise is termed as SR [minimum
region in Fig. 2(d)].

Fig. 2(d) shows that the system attains a state where
coherency of oscillation increases with the increase of
noise intensity, and subsequently decreases at higher
value of noise. At lower noise level, the inter peak dis-
tance or time is dominated by the activation time (ta)
of the limit cycle oscillation, which varies signiﬁcantly.
Again with the increase of noise level, the activation time
(ta) decreases and excursion time (te) dominates, and

hence the system reaches regularity. The activation time
is the time required to excite the system, where as the
excursion time is the time required to return from the ex-
cited state to the ﬁxed point. The Fig. 3 shows that the
pulse duration is given by tp = ta + te. For small noise
level, ta >> te and the period of the time series is domi-
nated by activation time, and hence tp ≈ ta. In the case
for high level of noise, the activation time (ta) is negligi-
ble and the excursion time (te) dominates the dynamics,

and hence tp ≈ te. At an optimum level of noise, the
number of crossings of threshold is much larger than the
excursion frequency of oscillation. The limit cycle oscilla-
tion is distorted at high frequency noise level, and hence
the AMD increases, which has been shown in Fig. 2(d).
We have also carried out PSPICE simulation using
multisim to verify the experimental results of SR. The
set point of the threshold was set at 3 V for the present
experiment. For simulation, variable resistance R1 was
chosen slightly higher than the experimental value to ob-
tain the relaxation oscillations. The weak periodic sig-
nal of amplitude 20 mV and noise are added through
0.1 µF capacitor and data was taken at base terminal
(VBO). We have chosen the following set of values of ca-
pacitors and resistors for simulation of SR: R2 = 470 Ω,
R3 = 390 Ω, C1 = 0.1 µF and C2 = 100 nF as shown
in Fig. 1, and all of these components have tolerance of
5%. Figs. 4(a)- 4(c) show the three time series of VBO at
diﬀerent noise level, and corresponding AMD has been
shown in Fig. 4(d). The simulation results are in good
agreement with our experimental results.

B. Eﬀects of high frequency signal: Vibrational
resonance

It is already seen in Subsec. III A that noise can play
an important role in the dynamics of excitable non-linear
system. Here we have studied the eﬀect of HFS to pro-

duce SR kind of phenomena, which is generally termed as
vibrational resonance (VR). When the UJT-RO was per-
turbed with a HFS of smaller amplitude in place of noise
in SR experiment as described in Subsec. III A, same kind
of random spikes have been observed in the time series
as shown in Fig. 5(a). The corresponding AMD value
comes out to be high as shown in Fig. 5(d). Further it is
interesting to note that as we increase the amplitude of
HFS, the value of AMD decreases, which is clearly visi-
ble from Fig. 5(d). It reaches a minimum around a noise
level of 0.7 V, and the corresponding time series around
this point has been given in Fig. 5(b). The minimum in
the Fig. 5(d) represents the optimum response of the sys-
tem, i.e, a maximum regularity or uniformity is obtained
in the dynamics. So we can conclude that around the
minimum, optimal detection of WPS can be achieved.
Further increase in the intensity of HFS, regularity of
the time series gets destroyed due to HFS perturbation
as shown in Fig. 5(c), which is also clear from the AMD
value [Fig. 5(d)]. The higher value of AMD in Fig. 5(d)
represents a time series of Fig. 5(c). It shows that, the
AMD increases with irregularity in the dynamics. At
higher amplitude of HFS perturbation, the system dy-
namics get aﬀected only by HFS suppressing the eﬀect
of WPS.

Therefore, coherency of the oscillation produced by the
system is negligible when the amplitude of HFS is very
low and increases with the increase in the amplitude of
HFS. At low level of HFS the inter peak distance or time

is dominated by the activation time of the limit cycle
oscillation, which varies randomly. With increases in
the amplitude of HFS, the activation time decreases and
hence the AMD also decreases. At an optimum level of
HFS, crossing of threshold by the external perturbation,
is much larger than the excursion frequency of oscillation,
and hence we get optimum regular oscillation, which is
also clear from the minimum of AMD graph [Fig. 5(d)].
The limit cycle oscillation gets distorted at HFS, and
hence AMD increases with the increases of HFS ampli-
tude which is also clear from Fig. 5(d).

PSPICE simulation of VR was carried out under the
similar conditions mentioned in Subsec. III A. The time
series thus obtained are presented along with the AMD
as shown in Fig. 6. The simulation results are almost in
agreement with the experimental results.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, occurrence of Stochastic resonance (SR)
and Vibrational resonance (VR) has been studied exper-
imentally in UJT-RO experiment. The experimental re-

sults have also been veriﬁed using PSPICE simulation.
In both SR and VR, system has been seen to mimic the
low frequency weak periodic signal with optimum level
of noise and high frequency signal respectively. Perfor-
mance of VR has been found more eﬀective than SR to
produce the dynamics that mimics the weak perturba-
tion. We expect that these kind of experimental studies
may help to detect weak signals using nonlinear dynamics
that may be applicable in various scientiﬁc ﬁelds. Fur-
ther, it also gives a unique method to design an excitable
system, where implementation of external perturbation
is easier.
