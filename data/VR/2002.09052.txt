Abstract—In this paper, the problem of associating reconﬁg-
urable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to virtual reality (VR) users is
studied for a wireless VR network. In particular, this problem
is considered within a cellular network that employs terahertz
(THz) operated RISs acting as base stations. To provide a seamless
VR experience, high data rates and reliable low latency need
to be continuously guaranteed. To address these challenges, a
novel risk-based framework based on the entropic value-at-risk
is proposed for rate optimization and reliability performance.
Furthermore, a Lyapunov optimization technique is used to refor-
mulate the problem as a linear weighted function, while ensuring
that higher order statistics of the queue length are maintained
under a threshold. To address this problem, given the stochastic
nature of the channel, a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm is proposed. Since the state space is extremely large,
the policy is learned through a deep-RL algorithm. In particular,
a recurrent neural network (RNN) RL framework is proposed
to capture the dynamic channel behavior and improve the speed
of conventional RL policy-search algorithms. Simulation results
demonstrate that the maximal queue length resulting from the
proposed approach is only within 1% of the optimal solution.
The results show a high accuracy and fast convergence for the
RNN with a validation accuracy of 91.92%.

I. INTRODUCTION

Virtual reality (VR) applications will revolutionize the way
in which humans interact by allowing them to be immersed, in
real time, in a range set of virtual environments [1]. Neverthe-
less, unleashing the potential of VR requires their integration
into wireless networks in order to provide a seamless and
immersive VR experience [2]. However, deploying wireless VR
services faces many technical challenges, the most fundamental
of which is providing high rate wireless links with high relia-
bility. On the one hand, VR communication requires high data
rates to guarantee a seamless visual experience while delivering
360◦ VR content. On the other hand, providing reliable haptic
VR communications will also require maintaining a very low
end-to-end (E2E) delay in face of extreme and uncertain
network conditions.

Guaranteeing this dual performance requirement constitutes
a major departure from classical ultra reliable low latency
communications (URLLC) services limited to low-rate sensors

This research was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under
Grant CNS-1836802, and in part, by the Academy of Finland Project CARMA,

Project SMARTER, as well as by the INFOTECH Project NOOR.

[3], or traditional enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services
limited to high capacity delivered to dense networks [4]. In
order to overcome the rate challenge of VR communications,
one can explore the high bandwidth available at the terahertz
(THz) frequency bands [5]. However, the reliability of the
THz channel can be impeded by its susceptibility to blockage,
molecular absorption, and communication range. This, in turn,
can violate the reliability requirements of VR systems. In order
to alleviate these reliability concerns, one can deploy reconﬁg-
urable intelligent surfaces (RISs) [6] acting as a base station
(BS) that can provide a nearly continuous line-of-sight (LoS)
connectivity to VR users. The RIS concept can be viewed as
a scaled-up version of conventional multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO) systems beyond their traditional large array
concept, however, an RIS exhibits several key differences from
massive MIMO systems [6]. Most fundamentally, RISs will be
densely located in both indoor and outdoor spaces, making it
possible to perform near-ﬁeld communications through a line-
of-sight (LoS) path. Hence, coupling RISs with THz communi-
cations can potentially provide connectivity that exhibits both
high data rates and high reliability (in terms of guaranteeing
LoS communication). Moreover, VR users will always be at
a proximity of physical structures with high rate wireless
capabilities. Thus, it is imperative to understand whether THz-
operated RISs can indeed provide an immersive VR experience
by delivering continuously reliable connectivity with low E2E
delay and high data rate.

A number of recent works attempted to address the chal-
lenges of VR communications [1], [7]–[9]. In [7], the authors
study the spectrum resource allocation problem with a brain-
aware quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. The work in [1]
proposes a VR model that captures the tracking and delay
components of VR QoS. Meanwhile, the work in [8] proposes
a novel framework that uses cellular-connected drone aerial
vehicles to collect VR content for reliable wireless transmis-
sion. In [9] the authors study the issue of concurrent support of
visual and haptic perceptions over wireless cellular networks.
However, the works in [1] and [7]–[9] do not account for
realistic delays and their statistics, and their solutions cannot
satisfy high rates and low latency simultaneously. In contrast, to
provide reliable VR, it is of interest to explore the possibility of
deploying RISs. If properly operated, serving VR users through
existing walls and structures with wireless capabilities will

 
 
 
 
 
 
unleash the potential of reliable VR. Speciﬁcally, equipping
RISs with THz will guarantee the overall seamless experience.
We also note that despite the surge of recent works on THz
communications (e.g., see [10] and [5], and references therein)
and RIS design and optimization (e.g., see [11], [12], and
references therein), these works focus on the physical layer
and do not address VR or networking challenges of THz
communications.

The main contribution of this paper is a novel rate and
reliability optimization framework for VR systems leveraging
THz-operated RISs. We consider the downlink of a cellular
network in which THz-operated RISs serve VR users. In this
network, due to the mobility of users and the stochastic nature
of the channel, the RISs must be dynamically and intelligently
to guarantee reliability and
scheduled to VR users. Also,
capture a full knowledge of delay statistics, we propose a novel
approach that exploits the economic concept of entropic value-
at-risk (EVaR) which coherently measures the risk associated
to a random event [13]. Hence, the EVaR is employed so as to
capture higher order statistics of the delay and, thus, allowing
us to deﬁne a concrete a measure of the risk associated to
delay unreliability. We then formulate a high reliability and
sum rate maximization scheduling problem by combining both
Lyapunov optimization and deep neural networks (DNNs).
Using the Lyapunov optimization technique, the problem is
transformed into a linear weighted function, which ensures
that
the maximum queue length and the maximum queue
length variance among VR users remains bounded. To solve
the proposed Lyapunov optimization problem, we propose
a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) that can ﬁnd the user associations to
RISs while capturing the dynamic temporal behavior of the
users in the channel. Simulation results show that the gap
between the proposed approach and the optimal solution is
minimal.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The system
model is presented in Section II. The risk aware association
for VR users is proposed in Section III. The RL approach
is presented Section IV. In Section V, we provide simulation
results. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VI.

II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider the downlink1 of an RIS-based wireless network in
a conﬁned indoor area, servicing a set U of U mobile wireless
VR users via a set B of B RISs acting as THz operated
BSs as depicted in Fig. 1. The VR users are mobile and
may change their locations and orientations at any point in
time. We consider discrete time slots indexed by t with ﬁxed
duration τ . Each RIS is a BS, that is provided with a feeder
(antenna) with a corresponding transmit power denoted by p.
Hence, the transmitted data is encoded onto the phases of the
signals reﬂected from different reconﬁgurable meta-surfaces
that compose the RIS [6]. Henceforth, if the RIS consists

scheme and is outside of the scope of this paper

of N meta-surfaces whose reﬂection phase can be optimized
independently, then an N -stream virtual MIMO system can
be realized by using a single radio frequency (RF) active
chain [6]. We assume that the RF source is close enough
to the RIS surface so that
the transmission between each
pair of RF source and RIS is not affected by fading. Then,
the electromagnetic response of the N meta-surface elements
can be programmed by using a centralized controller, which
generates input signals that
tune varactors and change the
phase of the reﬂected signal [11]. Let Φbu,t = [φbun,t]N ×1
be the phase shift vector of RIS b , with respect to the user
equipment (UE) u, at time slot t, where φbun,t ∈ Φ, n is
the index corresponding to the meta-surface of each RIS, and
Φ = {−π + 2zπ
Z−1 |z = 0, 1, ..., Z − 1}. Z is the number of
possible phase shifts per meta-surface element.

A. Channel Model

Due to the mobility of the VR users, the THz link between
a VR user and its respective RISs may be blocked by self-
blockage, i.e., the event of blocking the signal received by
UE u’s own body, or by dynamic blockages, i.e., blocking
the signal by other VR users’ bodies respectively. Let sbu,t
be a random binary variable where sbun,t = 1 if there is a
LoS link between RIS b and VR UE u at time slot t, and
sbun,t = 0, otherwise. As a byproduct of directional beam-
forming and propagation differences, the network considered
is noise limited. Thus, the random channel gain between RIS
b and VR UE u at time slot t is given by [14]:

hbu,t =

0,

(cid:1)2(cid:0)e−k(f )dbu,t (cid:1)2

,

with Pr(sbun,t = 1),
with Pr(sbun,t = 0).

dbu,t is the distance between RIS b and the VR UE u at time
slot t, k(f ) is the overall molecular absorption coefﬁcients of
the medium at THz band, and f is the operating frequency.
Let ψbun,t be the phase shift of the channel between VR UE
u and the meta-surface n of RIS b at t. Then, for a given
reﬂection phase shift vector, Φbu,t, the transmission rate from
RIS b to VR UE u will be (under an approximate average
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value across the THz band):

every RIS association is equal to ψbun,t, thus maximizing the
rate ˜rbu,t, as shown in [6]. This selection will be made by the
controller after learning the RIS association and optimizing it,
as shown in subsequent sections.

B. Queuing Model

Each RIS is equipped with mobile edge computing (MEC)
capabilities, and, thus, we model the queuing and transmission
of each VR content as an M/G/1 queue at the MEC server of
the RIS. We deﬁne a decision binary variable xbu,t that is equal
to 1 if RIS b is scheduled to serve the VR content queue of user
u at time slot t, otherwise xbu,t = 0. Note that, multiple users
can be associated to one RIS, however, each user is connected
to a single RIS. Let Qu(t) be the queue length corresponding
to UE u’s requested VR image at the beginning of slot t, then
the queue dynamics are given by:

Qu,(t+1) = max{Qu,t − ˜Rbu,t, 0} + Au,t, if xbu,t = 1,

(2)

where Au,t is the number of VR images queued for trans-
mission at time slot t. The arrival of VR content follows a
Poisson arrival process with mean rate λu. ˜Rbu,t is the rate of
VR image transmission over THz link between RIS b and VR
UE u at time slot t. ˜Rbu,t = ˜rbu,tτ
M where M is the size of the
VR image. Given that the availability of the THz LoS link is
a random variable, ˜Rbu,t is a stochastic random variable with
respect to time.

III. RISK-AWARE RIS-VR USER ASSOCIATION

A. Problem Formulation

Our goal is to characterize the RIS-UE association policy
which determines the system parameters over a ﬁnite horizon
of length T . The objective of this optimal policy is to max-
imize the sum-rate while maintaining reliable transmission.
Formally, we deﬁne a policy Πt = {xbu,t|∀b ∈ B, ∀u ∈ U}
for the controller that associates each RIS to its respective
VR users. The control policy at a given slot t depends on
unknown environmental changes, which is a consequence of
the stochastic nature of the channel and the sudden changes that
might block the LoS signal between RISs and mobile VR UE.
Thus, Pr(sbun,t = j|sbun,(t−1) = i), ∀b ∈ B, ∀u ∈ U, over the
LoS THz links. Furthermore, the reliability metric is satisﬁed
as long as the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the
E2E delay does not exceed the reliability constraint associated
with its respective network. Subsequently, to account for the
risk of loss incurred when reliability is not satisﬁed, the value-
at-risk (VaR) concept deﬁned as VaR1−α = − inf t∈R{P (X ≤
t) ≥ 1 − α} [13], can be used. However, VaR is an uncoherent

γ

risk measure, making its analysis intractable. Thus, we deﬁne
the EVaR as φt = log E[exp(−γQt)]
, which is a coherent risk
measure that corresponds to the tightest possible upper bound
obtained from the VaR. In the EVaR, Qt := maxu∈U {Qu,t}
and 0 < γ (cid:28) 1. Subsequently, to ensure reliability, the fol-
lowing condition needs to be met: limt→∞ φt < κ. Expanding
the Maclaurin series of φt with respect to the log and exp
functions we obtain, φt = E[Qt] + ϑ(Qt) − 1 + O(Q3
t ),
where ϑ(Qt) = E[Q2
t ] − E[Qt]2 is the variance of the
maximum queue length. Thus, to minimize limt→∞ φt, it is
sufﬁcient to minimize the ﬁrst two terms of its Maclaurin
series. Consequently, we formulate the RIS association and
phase shift-control problem for an RIS-assisted THz indoor
network as follows:

Here, maximizing the objective function in (3) ensures that the
visual component of the VR experience is guaranteed, thus,
delivering a seamless experience. On the other hand, (4) and
(5) ensure that the constraint of mitigating the risk will be
satisﬁed, where η = ε2 + 2 [γ(κ + 1) − ε], this further guar-
antees that the haptic component of the VR will be delivered
successfully. Given that the length of the queues changes with
random events and their probability distribution is not known
a priori, the optimization problem in (3) cannot be solved
using traditional stochastic optimization techniques [16]. Next,
we propose a tunable minimum-drift-plus-penalty optimization
problem based on Lyapunov optimization to reformulate the
problem stated previously.

B. Lyapunov Optimization

We use a Lyapunov optimization approach [16] to solve
problem (3). This approach allows us to convert the constraints
into a tractable form. Henceforth, to ensure (4) and (5), we
deﬁne two virtual queues Z1 and Z2, having with the following
dynamics:

Z1,(t+1) = max{Z1,t + Qt − ε, 0},
Z2,(t+1) = max{Z2,t + Q2
t − η, 0}.

(10)

Moreover, given that our initial optimization problem is a
maximization problem, our aim is to minimize the drift-plus-

as in (4) and (5).

Thus, employing virtual queues and Lyapunov optimization
allowed us to transform our optimization problem into a
linear weighted function. Nevertheless, solving problem (14)
using integer programming will be very complex due to its

combinatorial nature and the stochasticity of the variables.
Given that the distribution of system parameters is not char-
the problem cannot be solved using stochastic
acterizable,
matching theory or stochastic optimization. Next,
to solve
(14) we propose a centralized and low-complexity RNN RL
framework that provides the optimal policy for the RIS-UE
association. Moreover, RNN RL is suitable for this problem
since it can reduce the dimensionality of the large state space,
while capturing dynamic temporal behaviors [17].

(cid:80)

u∈U xbu,t ˜Rbu,t − (cid:80)U

In this section, an adaptive control policy based on a deep RL
framework is proposed. The proposed framework will allow us
to learn the policy to solve the problem of RIS-UE associations
in (14). We model (14) as a Markov decision process (MDP)
represented by the tuple {S, A, P, R}, where S is the state
space, A is the action space, P is an unknown state transition
function, P (s(cid:48), s, a) = Pr(st+1 = s(cid:48) | st = s, at = a), and
R(at, st) is the reward function [18]. Our action space is the
set of all possible RIS associations VR UEs, A = {[xbu]B×u |
xbu ∈ {0, 1}, b = 1, ..., B, u = 1, ..., U } and the reward is
R(at, st) = V (cid:80)
u=1 Qu,t(Au,t −
Rbu,t) − Z1,t(Qt − ε) − Z2,t(Q2
t − η) which is the current
objective function in (14). The state is the set of VR UE
queue lengths, virtual queue lengths, and the state of LoS links
between RISs and VR UEs, S = {[sbu]B×u, [Qu]U ×1, Z1, Z2, |
sbu ∈ {0, 1}, {Qu, Z1, Z2} ∈ {Z+, b = 1, ..., B, u = 1, ..., U }.
the class of parameterized policies of our
MDP as Πt = {πθ(at|st) | θ ∈ Rm}, where πθ(at|st) =
Pr{a = at|s = st, θ}. The stochastic reward function
R(at, st) during next time slot has a transition probability of
ρt = (cid:81)
s(cid:48)∈S πθ(at|st) Pr(st+1 = s(cid:48)|st = s, at = a). To
solve the optimization problem in (14), the controller needs
to have full knowledge about the transition probability and all
possible values of R(at, st) for all possible states of MDP un-
der a given policy πθ. Given that our model is highly dynamic
due the mobility of users and the nature of the channel, the
transition probability of states cannot be characterized through
probability distribution functions (PDFs). Thus, it is necessary
to use an RL framework to solve (14). We particularly use
a policy-search approach to ﬁnd the optimal RIS to VR user
association while maintaining a high reliability and a high data
rate formulated in (14). For each policy, we deﬁne its value as:

We represent

J(θ) =

(cid:88)

s(cid:48)∈S R(at, st)ρt.

(18)

θ

Hence, to ﬁnd the optimal policy, we need to ﬁnd θ∗ =
arg max
J(θ). To do so, we need to perform a gradient ascent
on the policy parameters. Subsequently, we need to derive
∇θJ(θ). Similarly to [18], by writing ∇θ log πθ(at|st) =
∇θ πθ (at|st)
πθ (at|st) we can reformulate (18), as follows:

∇θJ(θ) ≈ EΛt{∇θ log πθ(at|st)R(at, st)},
where Λt = {at, st+1 = s(cid:48) | s(cid:48) ∈ S} is the trajectory of the
MDP for the next time slot. Subsequently, we can use (19)

the number of states is considerably high,

to solve the optimization problem in (14) using a gradient
ascent algorithm such as REINFORCE [18]. Nevertheless,
given that
this
procedure will be intractable, which motivates the need for
a function approximator through the use of DNNs. Given
that the reliability depends on the prediction of the VR users
mobility pattern that will determine their associations to RISs,
it is important to implement a framework that is capable of
capturing the dynamic behavior exhibited. To address these
challenges, using an RNN to represent the policy of RL will
extract the channel’s dynamic features and learn an optimized
sequence guaranteeing reliability at each time instant, based on
the input features [17]. Since we deal with time-varying poli-
cies, it is natural to resort to RNNs. Indeed, RNNs are known
to be effective in processing time-related data and capture
dynamic temporal behaviors. As such, we represent the policy
πθ(a|s) by an RNN [19] that can learn the user associations to
RISs. In particular, we use a many-to-many RNN as shown in
Fig. 2. The overall RNN consists of an encoder and a decoder
network: The encoder network comprises three long short-term
memory (LSTM) layers, two fully connected layers and two
rectiﬁed linear unit (ReLu) layers. The state of the MDP is
thus encoded in the output of LSTM 3, h. As for the decoder
network, it consists of the last fully connected layer and the
B softmax layers. Moreover, the input consists of the states
st ∈ S of the MDP that are fed to the ﬁrst LSTM layer of
h hidden layers. Subsequently, the B softmax layers output
the actions of the MDP at ∈ A, i.e., the bth softmax layer
outputs {xbu | xbu ∈ 0, 1, b = 1, . . . , B, u = 1, . . . , U }. This
architecture was chosen given that the LSTM layers allow us to
avoid the problem of vanishing gradients [18]; more precisely
compared to other DNNs, it provides a faster RL algorithm via

a slow RL. That is, instead of depending on the convergence
speed of the RL algorithm through conventional gradient
ascent, its policy is represented by an RNN. Subsequently,
given that the RNN receives all the typical information that
a regular RL algorithm would receive, the activations of the
RNN store the state that would improve the speed of the RL
algorithm on the current MDP [20].

V. SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

For our simulations, we consider the following parameters:
T = 300 K, p = 1 W, M = 10 Mbits, f = 1 THz,
W = 30 GHz, K(f ) = 0.0016 m−1 with 1% of water vapor
molecules as in [21]. The RISs are deployed over the 4 walls
of an indoor area modeled as a square of size 40 m × 40 m.
All statistical results are averaged over a large number of
independent runs. In order to train the network, we consider
the RNN architecture shown in Fig. 2 with a maximum epoch
of 1000 and a minimum batch size of 128. Furthermore,
the network was trained with data generated from VR users
moving according to a random walk which constitutes the
most general scheme characterizing users’ mobility2 [19]. In
Fig. 3, we analyze the convergence of our proposed RNN-RL
algorithm, in terms of accuracy and training loss. Note that,
80% of our dataset is used for the training process, 10% is
used for the validation, and the remaining 10% is used for
testing. In particular, the training process uses data generated
from users’ random walks and the optimal solution to ﬁt the
model. Subsequently, throughout the validation process, the
random walks’ data is used to provide unbiased estimators of
the hyper-parameters corresponding to the RNN. Fig. 3 shows
a validation accuracy of 91.92%. Both the accuracy and loss
of the training and validation processes show smoothness in
the curve. Finally, after obtaining all the hyper-parameters of
the RNN, the test dataset can provide an unbiased evaluation

Fig. 4: Maximum queue length vs. number of time slots.

Fig. 5: Sum-rate of VR content vs. number of time slots.

We compare our RNN RL policy to the optimal solution for
different number of users. In Fig. 4, the maximum queue length
over the number of iterations is plotted. Given that the RNN
was capable of capturing the dynamic behavior of the channel,
for U = 7, the maximum queue length for the policy-approach
is only 0.52% higher than the optimal maximum queue length.
Meanwhile, for U = 3 it is nearly equal to the optimal solution.
Thus, this conﬁrms that combining the risk-based approach
with the RNN RL leads to highly reliable results. Clearly, the
maximum queue length increases as the number of VR users
in the network increases. Fig. 5 shows the sum-rate of VR
content, which constitutes the objective function in (14), over
time. Here, the policy-based controller offers a solution that is
considerably farther than the optimal solution in comparison
to the results obtained for the maximum queue length in
Fig. 4. The reason for this is that a sum-term rate is being
compared rather than individual rates; thus, the inaccuracy in
every measure propagates into a higher inaccuracy when terms
are added. As we can see, for U = 7, the sum-rate for the
policy-approach is 22% less than optimal sum-rate. As for
U = 3, it is 35% less than the optimal solution. Clearly, as
the number of VR users increases, the sum-rate increases, and
so does the gap between the optimal solution and the policy
approach.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have investigated the problem of RIS-
VR user association while guaranteeing reliable, low latency
and high rate communications. We have proposed a risk-
based aware optimization problem that takes into account the
