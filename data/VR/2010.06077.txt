Abstract. Public speaking is an essential skill in everyone’s professional or ac-
ademic career. Nevertheless, honing this skill is often tricky because training in 
front of a mirror does not give feedback or inspire the same anxiety as present-
ing in front of an audience. Further, most people do not always have access to 
the place where the presentation will happen. In this research, we developed a 
Virtual Reality (VR) environment to assist in improving people’s presentation 
skills.  Our  system  uses  3D  scanned  people  to  create  more  realistic  scenarios. 
We  conducted  a  study  with  twelve  participants  who  had  no  prior  experience 
with  VR.  We  validated  our  virtual  environment  by  analyzing  whether  it  was 
preferred to no VR system and accepted regardless of the existence of a virtual 
audience. Our results show that users overwhelmingly prefer to use the VR sys-
tem as a tool to help them improve their public speaking skills than training in 
an empty environment. However, the preference for an audience is mixed.

Introduction  

The  fear  of  public  speaking  is  the  most  mentioned  in  surveys  on  fears  [1],  and 
training for presentations can be challenging. However, in Virtual Reality (VR) envi-
ronments, virtual characters can be to train presenter. Still, studies on the usefulness 
of  a  Virtual  Audience  (VA)  for  training  people  to  make  presentations  are  limited, 
focusing mostly on phobic people [2, 3]. However, in many situations, other people 
would like to practice interactive skills but lack the proper environment, as is the case 
in language learning [4, 5].   

It has been shown in previous studies that people, regardless of their fear of public 
speaking, present different heart rates when exposed to VA [6]. However, this study 
was done with older technology, it is unclear if  all people will be affected by a VA 
[7], because even simple changes as the viewing perspective can affect VR interac-
tion [8, 9].  

Further, even though much research has been done to demonstrate that a VA can 
yield positive results in the treatment of phobic people [10–13], not as much has been 
done  to  see  the  usefulness  of  a  VA  for  the  general  population.  To  this  end,  in  this 
research,  we  developed  a  VR  environment  to  enable  users  to  make  virtual  public 

2 

speaking  activities  or  presentations.  To  evaluate  the  acceptance  of  our  system  as  a 
training tool, we gathered presenter’s feedback.

Related Work 

Virtual Reality Exposure Therapies (VRET) are therapies that use VR to expose pa-
tients  to  their  fears  [14].  Even  before  modern  VR  head-mounted  displays  (HMDs),  
VRET  has  shown  potential  [2,  11,  15,  16].  VRET,  for  instance,  has  been  shown  to 
work well for different kinds of anxieties [3, 17], such public speaking [18]. Further, 
one of the most prominent uses of VR is for training [19]. Several studies have shown 
that VR is a disruptive and useful tool for the training of various skills  [16, 20, 21]; 
for technical [19], physical [22], and sociological training [23]. Even low-end VR can 
yield  positive  results  [24].  However,  more  realism  does  not  always  present  the  best 
results [25].  

2.1  VR as a Presentation Environment  

If conditions are adequate, VR can elicit similar presence levels compared to the 
real  world  in  an  interview  setting  [26]  it  can  even  provoke  fear  [6].  Even  though, 
these earlier models were not as realistic as what we can see in today’s VR, people 
with  social  anxiety  presented  clear  physical  responses  to  them.  However,  these  re-
sponses  were  not  as  prevalent  in  confident  people.  The  reason  for  these  responses 
may  be  because  these  participants  thought  the  audience  was  not  as  realistic  [6],  or 
they ignored them like participants from a similar study  [27]. Recent improvements 
in the realism level might have changed this paradigm or caused social anxiety peo-
ple to get so used to the technology that they do not get triggered anymore. Hence, 
this raises a question (RQ1) what are people’s opinions about VA made with the cur-
rent technology? 

A newer study analyzed if a realistic environment could increase the presence in a 
virtual  presentation  environment  [27].  The  researchers  from  this  study  created  a 
classroom identical to the one available in their environment. They then asked partic-
ipants to present to a VA and asked a semi-structured interview. They observed that 
participants overall appreciated the experience, and some felt it becoming more real 
as they got accustomed to it. However, some stated not perceiving the audience even 
though  they  appreciated  the  experience.  These  responses  raise  our  main  research 
question  (RQ2):  is  simply  having  a  virtual  classroom  enough  for  some  people?  To 
find the answer, we  created a presentation environment in which participants could 
present either to a realistic empty room or to a partially 3D scanned VA.

The VR Presentation Environment  

We developed a VR presentation environment to allow users to practice their presen-
tations. We utilized pre-made models for the VA’s body and movements. However, 

3 

their  heads  were  customizable  3D  models  of  actual  individuals;  in  our  case  the  re-
searchers (see Fig. 1). Based on the literature, we  theorized that this would help the 
users feel more at ease before a real-life presentations [6, 27].  

The  VR  environment  contained  a  slide  presentation on  the  back  and  footnotes  in 
the front, which allowed users to present looking at the audience. The footnotes were 
akin to the  presentation component in Microsoft PowerPoint; it allowed participants 
to  have  comments  or  texts  in  front  of  them  (just  like  a  prompter).  The  audience  al-
ways gazed at the presenter.

Experiment Design 

To  evaluate  whether  the  VR  audience  was  indeed  useful  and  to  validate  our  VR 
presentation environment as a tool to practice presentations, the experiment had three 
conditions. In one condition, the  participants practiced in front of a virtual audience 
(VRP). In another condition, the practice happened in an empty virtual room (VRE). 
As the control participants also practiced in the room alone without VR (RLE).  

We made a series of presentations in English with topics that the volunteers were 
not familiar with according to their backgrounds. The participants prepared within a 
specific time to become familiar with the topic, and then presented the slides to a real-
life audience. For all these later presentations, there  were always the same audience 
members. Since the participants could not see their virtual face, the face model was 
not altered (see Fig. 1), and the participants’ virtual hands matched their skin-tone.

ronment (middle). One presentation in real-life (right).  

4.1  Environment Metrics  

Each participant was asked to complete a simple questionnaire to collect demographic 
data. All participants were asked to self-assess their English level among the 6 levels 
of  the  CEFR  [26].  After,  they  completed  the  Personal  Report  of  Confidence  as  a 
Speaker  (PRCS)  [28],  which is  a  true  or  false  questionnaire  with  totaling  12  points. 
The more the volunteer scored, the more anxious the volunteer was supposed to be.  

We used the 5-Point Likert Self-Statements During Public Speaking (SSPS)  [29], 
which is referred to as a marker for short term treatments.  The higher the score, the 
more confident the presenter. Further, we asked the participants to rate from 0 (worst) 
to 5 (best) how good they felt the conditions were, and their familiarity with the topic.

After going through the three conditions, we  asked participants to rank each ver-
sion according to a list of criteria and to answer a few open-ended questions (see Ta-
ble 1).

4.2  Apparatus  

We  used  an  Oculus  Rift  CV1  as  our  HMD,  and  two  standard  27”  4K  monitor.  We 
used  the  Oculus  Touch  to  control  the  presentation  even  (the  real-life  presentation). 
Participants did not need to learn different controls for each version. We used moni-
tors  in  real-life  to  simulate  both  the  screen  on  the  back  and  the  text  area  facing  the 
volunteer. All text size was calculated to be the same in VR and on the monitor.  

4.3 

Participants  

We recruited a total of 12 participants (7 females; 4 males; 1 non-binary) from a local 
university. They had an average age of 19.88 (s.d. = 1.32), ranging between 19 and 
23. No volunteer mentioned health issues, physical or otherwise. No participant was a 
native English speaker. Half had experience with VR systems before the experiment. 
The participants were not offered any reward to participate in the experiment.   

4.4 

Procedures  

Each  participant  was  assigned  a  specific  order  of  the  three  conditions  in  which  to 
practice  the  presentation.  The  order  was  Latin  Square  counterbalanced  to  mitigate 
carry-over effects. Participants were debriefed about the experiment.  

Next, all participants were presented with a demonstration introduction of the Ocu-
lus  Rift  and  a  static  virtual  environment  to  get  them  acquainted  with  the  VR  HMD 
and set up—they were presented to the virtual room and a mock slide presentation.  

Then,  each  participant  was  left  alone  to  complete  the  training  without  being  ob-
served.  The  participants  had  15  minutes  to  train  for  the  presentation  on  the  current 
condition.  After  this  time,  the  participants  were  requested  to  remove  the  HMD  and 
answer the questions. They then presented present the topic in real-life.  

The participants were given 30 minutes to rest before  starting the next condition. 
After all, conditions were tested; the last questionnaire was given to the participants. 
The participants were told that the open-ended questions could be answered in their 

5 

native language if they felt more comfortable in doing so. In the end, the participants 
were thanked for their time, offered time to rest, and some refreshments. On average, 
each volunteer took one and a half hours to finish the whole data collection process.

RESULTS  

The  data  were  analyzed  using  both  statistical  inference  methods  and  data  visualiza-
tions.  We  conducted  Mauchly’s  Test  of  Sphericity.  We  also  employed  Repeated 
Measures  ANOVA  (RM-ANOVA)  using  Bonferroni  correction  to  detect  significant 
main effects. If the assumption of sphericity was violated, we  used the Greenhouse-
Geisser  correction  to  adjust  the  degrees  of  freedom.  To  control  for both  Type  I  and 
Type II errors we chose p < 0.10 for our analyses [30]. For the open-ended questions, 
we analyzed the sentences individually.  

5.1 

Pre-Questionnaire  

We  defined  the  bins  for  PRCS,  normally  distributed,  as  between  0  and  4  as  not  so 
nervous, until 8 as regular nervousness. Anything above was considered as extremely 
nervous. We dubbed these bins as Group Not Anxious (NA), Standard Anxious (SA), 
and Extremely Anxious (EA), respectively. 50% of the EA participants declared their 
level as B2. The other volunteers were mainly self-declared as B1.  

5.2  Questionnaires of Nervousness and Preference Order 

The SSPS questionnaire revealed significant differences after having practiced in the 
virtual  environment  the  participants  overall  felt  more  positively  to  present  to  a  real 
audience (F2, 22 =  3.051, p  =  .068).  The  positive  effect  was  more  present  on  the  NA 
participants  (F2,  6 =  4.043,  p  =  .077).  The  post-hoc  analysis  revealed  that  VRP  was 
especially more successful (see Fig 4) in making the participants feel less anxious (p 
= .085).  

Fig. 2. SSPS answers after training in each version, VR versions score slightly better. Partici-
pants’ ratings for each condition as a training tool.  

The participants rated the VRP version the best as a training tool (see Fig 4). Howev-
er, EA participants did not rate it more positively as a training tool than the other ver-
sions. The main difference in ratings came from NA participants.  

The overall ranking disregarding PRCS can be seen on Fig 5. 75% of the EA par-
ticipants chose one of the empty rooms as the version they felt most prepared on (R1). 

 
6 

However, they all selected the VRP as their second option. All EA participants select-
ed  the  VRP  as  the  version  in  which  they  felt  the  most  nervous  (R2).  Half  chose  as 
their  first  choice,  and  50%  preferred  it  as  their  second  version  (R3);  only  one  EA 
participant chose VRE as their first choice. Overall, VRP  was the condition that re-
ceived  the  most  positive  overall  feedback.  Only  one  NA  participant  chose  VRP  as 
their first choice. The SA participants consistently chose it as their first choice.

5.3  Open-Ended Questions  

The analysis of the interviews showed positive results and feedback. For Q1, one of 
the  most  common  words  reported  by  the  volunteers  is  that  the  environment  made 
them feel “good,” and it was or felt “real”.  

Q2  and  Q3  showed  that  participants  believe  that  a  virtual  audience  made  them 
nervous, but they thought it was good. For example, P3 said “[I feel] a little bit nerv-
ous,  especially  when  the  audience’s  action  changes.”  Some  participants  mentioned 
this as a positive point for making them better prepared to speak to the real audience 
later. P11 said that “There will be some tension, but it will then be easier in reality.” 
P4 mentioned that the audience was good even though they made him feel “serious”.   
The  EA  participants  were  the  ones  who  most  used  words  such  as  nervous  and 
scared. However, those were also the ones who commented most positively about the 
use  of  the  application.  As  P3,  who  scored  the  maximum  in  the  PRCS,  puts  it,  “[It] 
made  me  not  so  relaxed  but  really  help  me  improve  my  presentation.”  In  general, 
participants said that they did not want to change the audience. 

5.4  Discussion  

The  answers  to  the  open  questions  and  the  ranking  suggest  a  preference  to  VRP, 
which  also  indicate  that  the  use  of  this  VR  tool  for  training  has  the  potential  to  be 
well-accepted, and is aligned with previous research [6, 27]. Further the answers also 
show a positive aspect of having the faces of the real audience in the tool, which was 
described to give a “good nervousness”. Hence, the participants opinion about a VA 
with the current technology (RQ1) is positive. 

The  rankings  and  the  open-ended  questions  led  us  to  believe  that  the  fear  factor 
generated by the virtual audience is favorable to the participants who, in return, train 
harder, or started feeling more secure with themselves. This is expected based on the 
exposure  therapy  treatments  found  in  the  literature  [6].  This  might  indicate  that  an 
even greater audience might bring even better results.  

 
7 

Overall, VRP was verbally declared the most popular tool for a training presenta-
tion environment. Thus, in most cases, it is valuable to have a virtual audience inter-
acting with the presenter. However, some people are satisfied with training in an emp-
ty room, which answers positively to the RQ2.   

Although most participants are content with the VRP version, we recommend add-
ing a toggle button. This should satisfy most users who might appreciate the choice. 
This may be the case especially because it seems the requirements for people who are 
EA are different than that of those who just need to practice presentation.

Conclusion 

In this paper we explored whether there is a need (and the effect) of a virtual audience 
in  a  presentation  training  scenario  using  Virtual  Reality  (VR).  We  did  this  analysis 
through a series of subjective metrics which indicate that even though most people do 
appreciate  the  virtual  audience  generated  with  the  current  technology,  and  it  makes 
them  somewhat  positively  nervous.  For  some  people,  the current  virtual  audience  is 
not necessary, they are just as satisfied with the system without it. 

Further,  we  observed  that  a  simple  audience  that  follows  the  users  by  looking  at 
them is enough for creating a stimulating training environment for presentations in a 
VR environment. This is a system that aims to invoke feelings of anxiety and promote 
effective training. This VR environment was able to make users nervous and rated 4 
out of 5 as an effective training tool. We observed that the development of a training 
tool for public speaking training is the most adequate when it can have the audience 
and users would preferred to have the option to it on and off, depending on their pref-
erences. Overall, the tool we developed seems to be able to help students.
