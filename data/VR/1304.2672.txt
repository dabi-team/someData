ABSTRACT
The central parsec of the Milky Way is a very special region of our Galaxy; it contains
the supermassive black hole associated with Sgr A* as well as a signiﬁcant number
of early-type stars and a complex structure of streamers of neutral and ionized gas,
within two parsecs from the centre, representing a unique laboratory. We report the
identiﬁcation of a high velocity compact nebular ﬁlament 2.2 arcsec south of Sgr A*.
The structure extends over 1 arcsec and presents a strong velocity gradient of 200
km s−1 arcsec−1. The peak of maximum emission, seen in [Fe III] and He I lines, is
located at dα = +0.20 ± 0.06 arcsec and dδ = −2.20 ± 0.06 arcsec with respect to
Sgr A*. This position is near the star IRS 33N. The velocity at the emission peak is
Vr = −267 km s−1. The ﬁlament has a position angle of PA = 115◦ ± 10◦, similar to
that of the Bar and of the Eastern Arm at that position. The peak position is located
0.7 arcsec north of the binary X-ray and radio transient CXOGX J174540.0-290031,
a low-mass X-ray binary with an orbital period of 7.9 hr. The [Fe III] line emission
is strong in the ﬁlament and its vicinity. These lines are probably produced by shock
heating but we cannot exclude some X-ray photoionization from the LMXB. Although
we cannot rule out the idea of a compact nebular jet, we interpret this ﬁlament as a
possible shock between the Northern and the Eastern Arm or between the Northern
Arm and the mini-spiral “Bar”.

INTRODUCTION

The central parsec of the Milky Way (MW) is a very special
region of our Galaxy. It not only hosts the central supermas-
sive black hole, associated with Sgr A*, with well determined
mass (Ghez et al. 2008; Gillessen et al. 2009), but also con-
tains a signiﬁcant number of early-type stars, including some
in the Wolf-Rayet stage.

streamers,

The central cavity has a mini-spiral structure of
encircled by a circum-nuclear
ionized gas
disk (CND) of molecular gas. Most of the ionized gas
emission appears in Hydrogen and Helium recombination
lines, very likely originating from ionization produced
by the many young and hot OB stars; the equivalent
to some ∼ 250 O9 stars would be required to account
emission (Lacy, Achtermann & Serabyn 1991;

to the southwest of Sgr A* (Yusef-Zadeh, Morris & Ekers
1989, 1990; Zhao et al. 1991), associated with strong [Fe
III] emission (Eckart et al. 1992; Lutz, Krabbe & Genzel
1993). For a recent review of the literature on the Galactic
centre, see Genzel, Eisenhauer & Gillessen (2010).

X-ray binary transients are overabundant in the central
parsec of the MW. Muno et al. (2005a) have found that the
overabundance is at least a factor of 20, per mass, in the
central parsec when compared to the abundance at a dis-
tance between 1 and 23 parsecs. It is likely that this over-
abundance is due to three-body interactions between binary
star systems and either black holes or neutron stars that
have concentrated in the central parsec through dynamical
friction. This is also supposed to be the case with the for-
mation of similar systems in the cores of globular clusters
(Muno et al. 2005a).

The known X-ray transient closest to Sgr A*, at only
′′.8 south of the centre of the MW, is CXOGX J174540.0-
2
290031, discovered in 2004 (Muno et al. 2005a). It was found
to be an X-ray binary with an orbital period of 7.9 hr

Steiner et al.

(Muno et al. 2005a,b). From K band observations, an up-
per limit for any counterpart was set as K < 16, suggesting
that it is a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). This X-ray tran-
sient also revealed a radio outburst (Bower et al. 2005). This
large radio outburst, as well as its X-ray emission, suggests
that this source more likely contains a black hole than a neu-
tron star primary (Fender & Kuulkers 2001; Porquet et al.
2005).

In this paper we report the discovery of a high veloc-
ity compact nebular ﬁlament extending ∼ 1′′ with a strong
velocity gradient that could possibly be associated with a
colliding shock between the streamers of the mini-spiral.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

This paper analyzes archive data obtained with the Spectro-
graph for INtegral Field Observations in the Near Infrared
(SINFONI) on the VLT, available in a public access data
bank1. The observations were made in K band on April 22,
2007. A fore-optics of 0′′.250 pixel−1 was used, providing a
′′
ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 8
. A total of four exposures
of the Galactic nucleus were retrieved from the public data
bank to be used in this work.

′′ × 8

Standard calibration images of linearity lamp, distor-
tion ﬁbre (used in the data reduction to compute spatial
distortions and perform a spatial rectiﬁcation), ﬂat lamp,
arc lamp and sky ﬁeld were obtained from the public data
bank. Calibration images of an A0V standard star were also
retrieved from the data bank. The data reduction was made
with Gasgano software and included the following steps:
determination of the trim, sky subtraction, correction of
bad pixels, ﬂat-ﬁeld correction, spatial rectiﬁcation (includ-
ing correction for spatial distortions), wavelength calibration
and data cube construction. At the end of the process, four
data cubes were obtained, with spaxels (spatial pixels) of
′′.125. Afterwards, with a script developed by us
′′.125 × 0

and using data from the A0V standard star, we applied, in
an IRAF environment, telluric absorption removal and ﬂux
calibration to all the data cubes. Details of the data treat-
ment are given in Appendix A.

3 DATA ANALYSIS

After the data treatment, we applied PCA Tomography
(see Appendix A) again. Tomogram 1, shown in green in
Figure 1-a, displays the young stellar population. Tomo-
gram 2, shown in blue in Figure 1-a, reveals stars with
strong infrared excess, presumably very young stars, like
IRS 21 (Tanner et al. 2002) and IRS 1. The red compo-
nent in Figure 1-a corresponds to an image of stars obtained
by subtracting the edges of the CO bands from the recon-
structed data cube, after suppressing eingenvectors 1 and
2 (see Steiner et al. 2009 for a description of “feature sup-
pression”). The stellar component revealed by Figure 1-a
basically shows the known young as well as the old stellar
populations. IRS 16, the closest IRS source to the Galactic
centre, is resolved in the individual stars, as is IRS 33 (SW
of the FOV).

We performed spectral synthesis on the spectrum
of each spaxel of the datacube analyzed here, using
the Starlight software (Cid Fernandes et al. 2005), which
matches the stellar spectrum of a given object with a model
corresponding to a combination of template stellar spectra
from a pre-established base. In this work, we used the base
of stellar spectra MILES (Medium resolution INT Library of
Empirical Spectra) (S´anchez-Bl´azquez et al. 2006), contain-
ing the spectra of 150 stellar populations with ages between
1.0 × 106 years and 1.8 × 1010 years and with metallicities
between 0.0001 and 0.05 (with Z⊙ = 0.02). The spectral
synthesis resulted in a synthetic stellar spectrum for each
spaxel of the data cube.

Before performing spectral synthesis on the data cube,
however, we prepared the spectra in two steps: correcting the
interstellar extinction due to the Galaxy, using AV = 19 and
the reddening law of Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis (1989); and
carrying out a spectral re-sampling with ∆λ = 1˚A per pixel.
The ﬁrst step used a script written in IDL language, while
the second used the task “dispcor”, of the “noao” package,
in IRAF environment.

In order to analyze the emission line spectrum in more
detail, we subtracted the synthetic stellar spectra obtained
with the spectral synthesis from the observed ones. This
procedure resulted in a data cube with emission lines only.
We then constructed RGB images of the emission lines Brγ
and He I λ20581˚A of this emission line data cube. We can
see that the recombination lines Brγ and He I λ20581˚A are
detected as stellar winds in early-type stars and, also, as
ionized interstellar lines basically delineating the Northern
Arm. A number of other lines are also seen in the southwest
of the FOV: λ21451˚A, λ22178˚A, λ22421˚A, and λ23479˚A are
the strongest among them and are identiﬁed as [Fe III] lines
(Lutz et al. 1993). We then constructed RGB images of the
emission lines Brγ and [Fe III] λ22180˚A, shown in Figure
1-c and Figure 1-d, respectively.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The ﬁlament is positioned in one of the mini-spiral regions
nearest to the Galactic centre, in the ﬁeld where the East-
ern and the Northern Arms of the mini-spiral cross. It is
also at the eastern edge of the mini-cavity. This ﬁeld shows
signiﬁcant blue-shifted He I emission line (Paumard et al.
2004) and also in the H92α and H30α lines (Zhao et al. 2009,
2010).

km s−1, respectively. f) Contours of the image shown in e). The + sign indicates the position of Sgr A*.

The ﬁlament that we see may be described as a “jet-
like” structure, being brighter at the centre and fading to-
wards the borders, at least as it is seen in the He I and
the [Fe III] lines (see Figure 3). This is in the part of the
mini-spiral closest to Sgr A*. The challenge is to explain the
compactness of the structure as well as its ionization (He I)
and excitation ([Fe III]).

The ﬁlament overlaps spatially with the star IRS33N
(see Figure 1-b and Figure 4). Could this star be the origin
of a jet? IRS 33N is a K = 11.1 star, presenting a spectral

type of B0.5-1 I and has a radial velocity of Vr = +68 ± 20
−1 (Paumard et al. 2006) while the centre of the ﬁl-
km s
ament is at Vr = −267 km s−1. Although close in terms
of spatial projected distance, the nebular ﬁlament is kine-
matically decoupled from the star IRS 33N. Therefore this
association can be discarded.

how to explain the large velocity gradient of ∼ 200 km s−1
−1. It probably has to do with the proximity of the
arcsec
supermassive black hole and its steep gravitational potential
gradient.

The blue arm of the ﬁlament points toward the mini-
cavity. This structure was modeled as a bubble of ionized
hot gas generated by a fast (> 1000 km s−1) wind originated
from one or several sources, within a few arcseconds from the
mini-cavity, and blown into the partially ionized neutral gas
streamers orbiting the centre of the Galaxy (Eckart et al.
1992; Wardle & Yusef-Zadeh 1992; Lutz et al. 1993; Melia,
Coker & Yusef-Zadeh 1996).

In fact, after computing the elliptical Keplerian orbits of
the streamers, Zhao et al. (2009) suggested that the North-
ern and Eastern Arms may collide in the “Bar” region, a
few arcesconds south of Sgr A*. This is the region with the
highest speciﬁc kinetic energy of both Northern and East-
ern Arms (see Figure 21 in Zhao et al. 2009). According to
Zhao et al. (2009), the high speciﬁc kinetic energy density
emphasizes the possibility that the mini-cavity was created
by strong shocks resulting from the collisions of the two
streamers.

4.2 The X-ray transient and origin of the nebular

lines

The peak of the emission of the ﬁlament is located 0′′.7 north
of the binary X-ray transient CXOGX J174540.0-290031,
a LMXB with an orbital period of 7.9 hr (Muno et al.
2005a,b). This source is associated to one transient and one
persistent albeit variable, radio sources (Bower et al. 2005).
The X-ray transient source CXOGX J174540.0-290031 was
detected on July, 5-7, 2004 and is located 2′′.8 south of Sgr
′′.3 (Muno et al. 2005a,b).
A*, with an uncertainty of about 0
Observations made at 43 GHz a few months earlier, on
March 28, 2004, detected two sources, named NE (north-
east, the strongest one, reaching 93 mJy at 43 GHz) and
SW (southwest) with a peak ﬂux of 48 mJy. The coinci-
dental variability of both radio and X-ray sources strongly
suggests that they are associated. Zhao et al. (2009) also re-
port radio observations at 1.3 cm and found that the SW
source is a persistent one, being detected before the transient
phenomenon at the 1.1 ± 0.1 mJy level. The NE component,
not detected in previous observations, was detected after the
transient. These authors interpret the NE component as a
hot spot associated with the head of the jet ejected from the
persistent SW radio-variable source. If so, then the stellar
counterpart of the X-ray binary is probably near the star
IRS 33SW, close to the X-ray error box (Figure 4). The po-
◦
sition angle of the radio jet is PA ∼ 60
, quite distinct from
the position angle of the nebular ﬁlament. As the ﬁlament is
′′.7 from the X-ray source and has a distinct position
at ∼ 0
angle, we may rule out any direct association between the
X-ray binary and the origin of the nebular ﬁlament.

The SINFONI observations (April 22, 2007) were made
a few years after the radio detection (March 28, 2004) and
also after the X-ray transients detections (July 5-7, 2004).
The nebular ﬁlament is characterized by a spectrum that is
quite distinct from other gas emitting regions in the FOV.
Brγ and He I λ20581˚A are the strongest lines. Other gas
emitting regions in the FOV are probably photoionized by
the young stellar population (such as in IRS 16) that pro-

northern edges of the Northern and Eastern Arm streamers, as
well as of the mini-cavity, are shown. Three stars of IRS 16 as well
as of IRS 33 are also shown. The position of Sgr A* is marked as a
+ sign. The error circle of the LMXB (green) and the associated
radio transients (red) are also shown.

4.1 Fireworks in the mini-spiral: a shock between

streamers?

The orbits of the mini-spiral have been described as contain-
ing a one-armed spiral in a Keplerian disk (Lacy et al. 1991)
that properly describes the [Ne II] λ12.8 µm. An alterna-
tive description is given by Zhao et al. (2009), in which the
whole mini-spiral is essentially described by three streamers
in elliptical orbits around Sgr A*, on the basis of H92α ob-
servations. The Northern and Eastern Arm streamers have
high eccentricities (e = 0.83 ± 0.10 and 0.82 ± 0.15, respec-
tively) and cross near the periastron. The formal solution
provides a projected crossing between the two orbits about
′′
4
to the south of the Galactic centre. This solution has been
disputed by Irons, Lacy & Richter (2012) who ﬁnd that the
one-armed spiral pattern may be a better description of the
[Ne II] nebular emission. The observations of both H92α and
the [Ne II] lines have good spectral resolution but poorer
′′.25 to 2
spatial resolution, of ∼ 1
, than the data reported
here. They could not have identiﬁed such a strong velocity
gradient in a ﬁlament so compact.

′′

Perhaps the best explanation for the existence of this
ﬁlament is that it is associated to a shock between streamers
in the mini-spiral. In the one-arm pattern, the position of the
ﬁlament is where the one-armed spiral ends; that could also
be seen as the crossing point between the Northern Arm and
the Bar. In the three ellipses model, the ﬁlament is near the
position where the projected orbits of the Northern and the
Eastern Arm streamers cross. It is perhaps not a coincidence
◦
that the position angle of the ﬁlament (PA = 115
)
is similar to that of the Eastern Arm and also of the Bar.
Perhaps the most challenging aspect of this interpretation is

◦ ± 10

duces UV photons capable of ionizing H and He (Genzel et
al. 2010). Such UV photons, because of their low energy, do
not heat the nebulae and some 250 O9 equivalent stars are
necessary to account for the emission (Zhao et al. 2010). The
vicinity of the X-ray source is the only region in the FOV
that presents such strong forbidden lines. But shock waves
are also eﬃcient in heating gas and enhancing forbidden
line emissions. The ﬁeld of IRS 33 is the hottest in the mini-
spiral, as measured from the H30α and H92α (Zhao et al.
2009, 2010), with a temperature of 13000 ± 3000 K and an
−3. The temperature of 13000
electron density of ∼ 105 cm
K is enough to excite the [Fe III] emission. It is not enough
to ionize the gas to the Fe++ phase. This requires a temper-
ature of T > 18000 K (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006). But the
′′
beam size of the radio observations is ∼ 2
; thus a compact
structure with T > 18000 K could certainly exist. For col-
lisional ionization of helium, the temperature must be even
higher: T > 30000 K. We conclude that shock heating could
both produce and excite the Fe++ ion, but not ionize He.
Therefore, a combination of non-shock ionization mechanism
plus shock heating seems to be required.

′′

Could the X-ray transient be, at least partially, respon-
sible for photoionizing the ﬁlament? Hard X-rays are eﬃ-
cient in photoionizing gas and heating it at the same time
(Halpern & Steiner 1983), enhancing the emission from low
ionization nebular species. However, the ionization parame-
−2 in order to produce high ionization
ter U must be U > 10
species and U ∼ 10−3 in order to produce low ionization
species (Ferland & Netzer 1983). In the present case, the
−1. How-
transient X-ray luminosity was Lx ∼ 4 × 1034 erg s
ever, at the time of the transient, diﬀuse X-ray emission was
observed ∼ 2
southwest of the source. This suggests
−1
that the real X-ray luminosity was Lx > 2 × 1036 erg s
(Muno et al. 2005b). The discrepant X-ray luminosity seen
directly is probably due to the fact that the X-ray binary is
seen nearly edge-on.

′′ − 3

Assuming that the x-ray luminosity is Lx ∼ 2×1036 erg
−6 at the
−1 we obtain an ionization parameter of U ∼ 5×10
s
ﬁlament; this is too low to produce a signiﬁcant ionization
eﬀect. We conclude that the X-ray binary has no ionization
or heating eﬀect on the ﬁlament unless the source radiates
soft X-rays near the Eddington limit. This could not have
been directly observed due to the strong interstellar absorp-
−2 at the ﬁlament and could
tion and would produce U ∼ 10
be responsible for the strength of the [Fe III] emission and,
perhaps, of He I.

Further studies are required to elucidate the nature of
this ﬁlament and the role of the LMXB in its neighborhood;
it is important to observe the FOV with better spatial res-
olution.

4.3 Summary

′′
We have analyzed a data cube centered ∼ 2
southeast of
Srg A*, obtained with the SINFONI/VLT IFU spectrograph
and studied the kinematics of the gaseous ionized emission
in the FOV. Our main ﬁndings are:

• We identiﬁed a compact nebular ﬁlament, 2

′′.2 south of
′′
Sgr A*. The structure extends over ∼ 1
and presents a
velocity gradient of ∼ 200 km s−1 arcsec−1. There is a peak
of maximum emission seen in [Fe III] and He I lines, located

at x = +0′′.20 ± 0′′.06 and y = −2′′.20 ± 0′′.06 with respect
′′.3 east of the star
to Sgr A*. This position is located at ∼ 0
IRS 33N. This emission has the most negative velocity in
the FOV we have analyzed.

◦±10

• The velocity at the emission peak, as estimated from the
Brγ, He I λ20581˚A and [Fe III] λ22178˚A is ∼ −267 km s−1.
◦
The nebular ﬁlament has a position angle of PA = 115
,
similar to that of the Eastern Arm at that position and to
the position angle of the mini-spiral Bar. Although close,
the nebular ﬁlament is, kinematically decoupled from the
star IRS 33N, which has a velocity of Vr = +68 ± 20 km
−1.
s
• The peak position is also located 0

′′.7 north of the binary
X-ray transient CXOGX J174540.0-290031, a LMXB with
an orbital period of 7.9 hr. This source is associated with
one transient plus one persistent and variable radio sources.
• The [Fe III] line emission is strong in the ﬁlament and its
vicinity. These lines are probably excited by shock heating.
Ionization/heating by soft X-ray photons from the nearby
LMXB is possible, although unlikely, because of the high
luminosity required.

• Although we cannot rule out the possibility that we
are dealing with a jet-like structure, we propose that the
ﬁlament may represent a shock from the collision between
the Northern and the Eastern Arm streamers around the
centre, or perhaps, between the Northern Arm and the Bar.

of the data cube, we obtained spaxels of 0′′.0625 × 0′′.0625.
This procedure does not change the spatial resolution of the
observation, but sharpens the contours of the structures in
the images. The disadvantage of such spatial re-sampling is
that it introduces high spatial frequency components in the
images (usually in the form of small vertical and horizon-
tal stripes). The high spatial frequency components, how-
ever, are not a serious problem because, after the spatial
re-sampling, a Butterworth spatial ﬁltering was applied to
all the images of the data cube, to remove high spatial fre-
quency noises, including the high frequency components in-
troduced by the spatial re-sampling. The steps of this pro-
cess were as follows: calculation of the Fourier transforms
(F (u, v)) of all the images of the data cube; multiplication of
the Fourier transforms F (u, v) by the image corresponding
to the Butterworth ﬁlter (H(u, v)); calculation of the inverse
Fourier transforms of all the products F (u, v) × H(u, v); ex-
traction of the real part of the calculated inverse Fourier
transforms. The Butterworth ﬁlter used in this case corre-
sponds to the product of two identical circular ﬁlters, with
orders n = 2 and cutoﬀ frequencies along the horizontal and
vertical axis equal to 0.27 Ny (Nyquist frequency).

We detected the presence of a probable instrumental
“ﬁngerprint” in the data cube, after the Butterworth spatial
ﬁltering, which appeared in the data cube as a large horizon-
tal strip in the images and also had a low frequency spectral
signature. In order to remove it, we applied the PCA Tomog-
raphy technique (Steiner et al. 2009) to the data cube. PCA
transforms data expressed originally in correlated coordi-
nates into a new system of uncorrelated coordinates (eigen-
vectors) ordered by principal components of decreasing vari-
ance. PCA Tomography consists in applying PCA to data
cubes. In this case, the variables correspond to the spec-
tral pixels of the data cube and the observables correspond
to the spaxels of the data cube. Since the eigenvectors are
obtained as a function of the wavelength, their shape is sim-
ilar to spectra and, therefore, we call them eigenspectra.
On the other hand, since the observables are spaxels, their
projections on the eigenvectors are images, which we call
tomograms. The simultaneous analysis of eigenspectra and
tomograms allows one to obtain information that, otherwise,
would possibly be harder to detect. Using PCA Tomogra-
phy, we were able to identify and remove the instrumental
ﬁngerprint of the data cube analyzed here (Steiner et al., in
preparation).

Finally, a Richardson-Lucy deconvolution (Richardson
1972; Lucy 1974) was applied to all the images of the data
cube, using a synthetic Gaussian PSF. The use of a Gaussian
PSF was possible in this case because we veriﬁed that the
original PSF of this observation had an approximate Gaus-
sian shape. The ﬁnal data cube obtained after the full data
treatment has a point-spread function (PSF) with FWHM
∼ 0

′′.56 and a spectral resolution of R ∼ 5875.

APPENDIX A: DATA TREATMENT

After the data reduction, a correction of the diﬀerential
atmospheric refraction was applied to all data cubes, using
an algorithm developed by our group. It is important to
mention, however, that the relative shifts observed in the
images of all data cubes are not compatible with what is
expected for the diﬀerential atmospheric refraction eﬀect.
Therefore, we believe that these relative shifts are, at least
partially, a consequence of some instrumental eﬀect and not
entirely due to the diﬀerential atmospheric refraction. In
order to combine into one the four data cubes obtained after
the correction of the atmospheric diﬀerential refraction, we
divided the data cubes in two groups with three data cubes
each. Naming the data cubes 1, 2, 3 and 4 (according to
the order of the observations), the division in two groups
was the following:

Group 1: 1, 2 and 3
Group 2: 2, 3 and 4

We then calculated a median of
the data cubes of
each group, which resulted in two data cubes at the end of
the process. Finally, we calculated the average of the two
data cubes and obtained the ﬁnal, combined data cube.
