Abstract—Many  modern  applications  like  entertainment 
displays,  data  encryption,  security,  and  virtual  reality  (VR) 
technology require asymmetric light manipulation. Symmetric 
spin-orbit  interactions  (SOI)  apply  a  limit  in  achieving  an 
asymmetrical  metahologram.  However,  different  reported 
asymmetric  SOI's  based  on  propagation  and  geometric  phase 
mergence techniques effectively break this limit at the expense 
of design complexity and greater computation cost. This work 
proposes a novel helicity multiplexing technique that breaks all 
the  aforementioned  barriers  in  achieving  on-axis  dual  side 
holograms. Benefiting from the geometric phase modulation of 
anisotropic  nano-resonating  antennas,  we  have  employed  a 
single unit cell to achieve helicity multiplexing. A low extinction 
coefficient material a-Si:H is used for device analysis. Due to the 
simple  single  unit  cell-based  designing  technique,  simulation 
and  fabrication  complexities  were  significantly  reduced.  As  a 
result,  based  on  the  helicity  and  incidence  direction  of 
electromagnetic  wave,  we  have  achieved  highly  transmissive 
dual  holographic  images  in  the  visible  band.  Our  simulated 
efficiencies are 55%, 75%, and 80% for the blue (λ = 488 nm), 
green (λ = 532 nm), and red light (λ = 633 nm).

INTRODUCTION  

The  2D  ultra-thin  version  of 

the  metamaterial, 
metasurfaces  bring  new  innovation  in  the  world  of  applied 
electromagnetic  and  photonics  by  catching  unprecedented 
control  over  light  properties  (i.e.,  amplitude,  phase,  and 
polarization)  [1,  2].  They  have  demonstrated  numerous 
interesting  applications  of  dual  side  displays  [3],  data 
encryption [4, 5], beam engineering [6], and wave absorbing 
[7,  8],  etc.  Metasurfaces  as  a  holographic  optical  element 
(HOE) congregated a prestigious amount of attention due to 
ultra-compactness, large viewing angle, and high diffraction 
efficiency.  Primarily,  for  both  reflection  and  transmission 
mode, plasmonic meta holograms are demonstrated, including 
multi-color  metaholograms, 
broadband  multi-plane 
holograms,  and  multiplexed  holograms  [9,  10].  However, 
their  applicability  is  greatly  constraint  by  inherent  ohmic 
losses due to metallic resonators, leading to lower efficiency 
and fabrication defects at optical wavelengths [11].

To  overcome  these  efficiency  barriers,  high  refractive 
index dielectrics with low extinction coefficients like silicon 
(Si),  titanium  dioxides  (TiO2),  and  gallium  nitride  (GaN) 
become  the  more  suitable  choice.  These  dielectrics  have 
multiple electric and magnetic resonances due to their inherent 
properties supporting high transmission in optical regime [12]. 
Huang  et  al.  utilized  Si-based  nano-rectangular  bars  for  a 
transmission 
to  realize 
type  all-dielectric  metasurface 
broadband  hologram  for  an  optical  regime  with  a  total 
efficiency of 3% [13]. Zhou et al. improved the efficiency up 
to  47%  at  a  single  optical  wavelength,  i.e.,  532  nm  using 
crystalline  Si  and  achieved  complete  0  to  2π  phase  control 
[14].  Though  Si  provided  fabrication  ease  and  showed 
promising  results  compared  to  plasmonic  materials,  its 
performance  is  still  degraded  due  to  the  high  absorption 
coefficient  at  optical  wavelengths.  As  a  result,  researchers 
exploited  GaN  and  TiO2  that  provide  a  wide  range  of 
transparent  windows  for  optical  wavelengths  [15,  16].  For 
example, Chen et al. realized a GaN-based multiplexed color 
router with metalens for three optical wavelengths of  488 nm, 
532 nm, and 633 nm with efficiencies of 87%, 91.6% 50.6%, 
respectively  [17].  Chen  et  al.  exploited  TiO2  based  meta-
axicons for multiple order bessel beam generation for visible 
regime [18]. Although these dielectric materials demonstrate 
promising results, high aspect ratios and incompatibility with 
existing  CMOS  technology  lead  to  fabrication  challenges 
limiting 
their  practical  applicability  [19].  To  outplay 
aforementioned  drawbacks,  the  hydrogen  added  amorphous 
silicon (a-Si:H) is introduced, which is well compatible with 
already mature CMOS foundry. Ansari et al. demonstrate the 
helicity  multiplexed  hologram  with  maximum  efficiency  of 
74% at optical wavelength 633nm [20].

Metasurface  efficiently  reconstructs  the  dual  holographic  information  of 
"KAUST"  and  "ITL"  for  orthogonal  circular  polarized  light.  Metasurface 
produces holographic image of "KAUST" when a "LCP" light is incident from 
backward  direction.  Similarly,  when  an  "RCP"  is  incident  from  backward 
direction proposed metasurface produces holographic image of "ITL".  

 
 
 
 
In  addition  to  efficiency  challenges,  distinct  information 
multiplexing on a single metasurface is a perilous task for the 
type 
research  community.  Conventionally,  segmented 
metasurface design was adopted, e.g., Ansari et al. encoded 
two  informations  ("ITU"  and  "RHO")  in  single  layer 
dielectric metasurface for orthogonal components of circular 
polarization [20]. Their designed surface achieved more than  
50%  efficiency  for  optical  band  of  549nm-700nm  and 
maximum  efficiency  at  633nm.    Another  approach  of 
multiple information encryption was utilized by Wan  et al., 
where  they  have  encoded  different  holographic  images  for 
circular polarization by incorporating the idea of interleaved 
metasurfaces 
the 
information multiplexing requirements but suffer in terms of 
design space usage, i.e., half of the metasurface is utilized at 
a  time  and  restrict  the  efficiency  to  50%.  Thus,  dual-phase 
mergence (i.e., propagation and geometric phase) is proposed 
to improve the design space and enhance design efficiency. 
For example, Naveed et al. optimized an array of eight-unit 
elements to reconstruct on-axis asymmetric dual holograms 
for optical regime [22]. They have resolved the design space 
challenges but critically heightened the design complexities, 
the 
which 
measured efficiency for the operational wavelength of their 
device is 59%.

anisotropic  nano-resonating  antenna  of  a-H:Si  over  glass 
substrate (SiO2) as pictorially depicted in Fig. 2a.  

 Thus,  for  this  purpose,  the  geometrical  parameters  of  an 
anisotropic rectangular bar, i.e., length L, width W, height H, 
and period P, are carefully engineered. The optimal value of 
periodicity  P=290  nm  is  designated  using  Nyquist  criteria 
(i.e., P< (λ/2NA)) while keeping H= 400 nm constant for the 
sake  of  simplicity.  L  and  W  are  tuned  to  achieve  the 
functionality of the half-wave plate. The optimization graph 
of L and W for high cross-polarized transmissivity at three 
different optical wavelengths, i.e. 488 nm, 532 nm, and 633 
nm, are depicted in Fig. 3 from (a) to (c) respectively. Their 
respective phase variations  for cross-polarized transmission 
are depicted in Fig. 3 (d-f). By careful optimization, a single 
point with L = 215 nm and W = 80 nm was selected in such 
a way that it has simultaneously maximum cross-polarization 
transmission  efficiency  and  minimum  co-polarization 
transmission for all three operating wavelengths in order to 
maintain broadband functionality.  Thus, when light impinges 
the  unit  element,  the  transmitted  electric  field  (𝐸𝑡)  can  be 
depicted by Equation (1):

Here  in  this  manuscript,  we  have  proposed  a  highly 
efficient  simplest  single  anisotropic  unit  element-based 
broadband dual information encryption technique for single-
layer  all-dielectric  metasurfaces.  A  novel  material  (a-H:Si) 
with  additional  hydrogen  content  in  conventional  a-H:Si  is 
utilized  to  have  a  wide  transparent  window  in  the  optical 
regime with a high refractive index [23]. Moreover, only the 
geometric  phase  is  exploited  for  full  phase  coverage  (0-2π) 
and retains an additional degree of freedom (i.e., propagation 
phase).  With  the ability  of  multi-functionality  with  simplest 
design  approach,  proposed  metasurface 
is  capable  of 
reproducing the holograms for wide range of optical regime 
with high efficiency compared to previously reported works 
[19-21]. The schematic illustration of the proposed concept is 
depicted in Fig. 1, where the metasurface reconstructs the two 
independent  holographic  images  for orthogonal components 
of CP light under normal incidence. Metasurface produced a 
holographic  image  of  "KAUST"  when  a  left  circularly 
polarized "LCP" light is incident from a backward direction. 
Similarly, when a right hand circularly "RCP" polarized light 
is  incident  from  backward  direction  proposed  metasurface 
produces  a  holographic  image  of  "ITL"  in  the  forward 
direction. 

II.  DESIGN METHODOLOGY 

to  demonstrate 

The  subwavelength  scale  nano-resonators  have a  unique 
ability  to  manipulate  the  wavefronts  and  phase  of  incident 
light.  Herein, 
the  proposed  helicity 
multiplexing  concept,  Panchartnam  Berry  (PB)  phase  is 
employed for covering the full phase range of 0 to 2π. For this 
purpose,  a  half  waveplate  is  designed  and  optimized  which 
can  suppress  the co-polarized  light  component  and  magnify 
the  cross-polarized light component. Thus, we employed an 

where 𝐸𝑖  is incident electric field and and 𝑅(𝜃) is rational 
matrix multiplied with transformational matrix. Furthermore, 
“𝜃”  defines  in-plane  angular  orientation  of  unit  element  as 
illustrated in Fig. 2b.

After getting an optimized nano-antenna, the phase mask 
of  two  images,  "ITL  and  KAUST,"  are  calculated  by  using 
Gerchberg Saxton (GS) algorithm for 206 × 206 unit elements 
[24].  These  phase  masks  are  further  processed  by  using 
Equation (2) to find a cumulative phase response that can be 
easily encrypted on the metasurface interface.

corresponding phase variations with respect to geometrical parameters. By simultaneous optimization of all three responses of transmission efficiency, a single 
optimal point of geometrical dimensions, i.e. L=215 nm and W=80 nm, is selected for metasurface design.

III.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

To  validate  the  proposed  theoretical  spintronics-based 
design  methodology  for  holography,  we  started  with  the 
numerical  computation  of  phase  masks  of  both  pieces  of 
information  "KAUST"  and  "ITL"  using  a  modified  GS-
algorithm for 60 × 60 μm2 meta-hologram that corresponds to 
206  ×  206  array  of  nano-resonating  elements.  These 
calculated  phase  masks  of  images  are  then  encoded  in 
metasurface by employing PB-phase with a single anisotropic 
unit  element  of  a-H:Si  defined  by  Equation  (1).  All 
simulations are carried out in the commercially available tool 
Lumerical FDTD at three different optical wavelengths, i.e., 
488 nm, 532 nm, and 633 nm. The simulated optical outputs 
of  the reconstructed  holograms  of  the designed  metasurface 
are demonstrated in Fig. 4. The re-produced results quite well 
match the predicted one and verify the proposed methodology 
functionality  for  holographic  meta-displays.  Under  LCP 
incidence,  a  holographic  image  "KAUST"  is  produced  at  a 
focal distance of 30 μm while the second holographic image 
of  "ITL"  is  reconstructed  for  orthogonal  component  (RCP) 
incidence  with  high  efficiency  and  fidelity.  High  efficiency 

with good fidelity and resolution of multiplexed hologram for 
wideband of optical regime proves the  proposed  strategy  of 
the single element based spintronic based holography.   

IV.  CONCLUSION 

The  phenomenon  of 

spintronic-based  asymmetric 
metaholograms is realized by exploiting low lose dielectric a-
H:Si-based  anisotropic  nano-resonating  antennas.  The 
proposed simplest novel concept of asymmetric on-axis dual 
side hologram reconstruction breaks the constraints of design 
complexity  and  computation  cost  with  fabrication  ease. 
Benefiting from the PB-phase modulation of anisotropic nano 
unit  element,  the  efficiency  of  design  space  is  improved  in 
terms  of  the  degree  of  freedom  and  multi-functionality. 
transmissive  dual 
Moreover,  we  have  realized  highly 
holograms  in  an  optical  regime  based  on  the  helicity  and 
incidence  direction  of  electromagnetic  wave  with  simulated 
efficiencies of 55%, 75%, and 80% for the blue (λ = 488 nm), 
green (λ = 532 nm), and red light (λ = 633 nm) respectively. 
Thus,  the  proposed  strategy  of  broadband  spin  multiplexed 
gives new direction toward many interesting applications of 
efficient  displays,  multi-media  devices,  imaging,  AR/VR-
based holographic elements, and data encryption.
