A Classical Density-Functional Theory for Describing Water Interfaces

Jessica Hughes, Eric Krebs, and David Roundy
Department of Physics, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA

We develop a classical density functional for water which combines the White Bear fundamental-
measure theory (FMT) functional for the hard sphere ﬂuid with attractive interactions based on
the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT-VR). This functional reproduces the properties of
water at both long and short length scales over a wide range of temperatures, and is computationally
eﬃcient, comparable to the cost of FMT itself. We demonstrate our functional by applying it to
systems composed of two hard rods, four hard rods arranged in a square and hard spheres in water.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A large fraction of interesting chemistry—including all
of molecular biology—takes place in aqueous solution.
However, while quantum chemistry enables us to calcu-
late the ground state energies of large molecules in vac-
uum, prediction of the free energy of even the smallest
molecules in the presence of a solvent poses a continuing
challenge due to the complex structure of a liquid and
the computational cost of ab initio molecular dynam-
ics1,2. The current state-of-the art in ab initio molecular
dynamics is limited to a few hundred water molecules per
unit cell3. On top of this, standard ab initio methods us-
ing classical molecular dynamics without van der Waals
corrections strongly over-structure water, to the point
that ice melts at over 400K4! There has been a ﬂurry
of recent publications implicating van der Waals eﬀects
as signiﬁcant in reducing this over-structuring5–8. It has
also been found that the inclusion of nuclear quantum
eﬀects can provide similar improvements9. Each of these
corrections imposes an additional computational burden
on an approach that is already feasible for only a very
small number of water molecules. A more eﬃcient ap-
proach is needed in order to study nanoscale and larger
solutes.

A. Classical density-functional theory

Numerous approaches have been developed to approx-
imate the eﬀect of water as a solvent in atomistic cal-
culations. Each of these approaches gives an adequate
description of some aspect of interactions with water,
but none of them is adequate for describing all these
interactions with an accuracy close to that attained by
ab initio calculations. The theory of Lum, Chandler and
Weeks (LCW)10, for instance, can accurately describe the
free energy cost of creating a cavity by placing a solute
in water, but does not lend itself to extensions treating
the strong interaction of water with hydrophilic solutes.
Treatment of water as a continuum dielectric with a cav-
ity surrounding each solute can give accurate predictions
for the energy of solvation of ions11–16, but provides no
information about the size of this cavity. In a physically
consistent approach, the size of the cavity will naturally
arise from a balance between the free energy required to

create the cavity, the attraction between the water and
the solute, and the steric repulsion which opens up the
cavity in the ﬁrst place.

One promising approach for an eﬃcient continuum de-
scription of water is that of classical density-functional
theory (DFT), which is an approach for evaluating the
free energy and thermally averaged density of ﬂuids in
an arbitrary external potential17. The foundation of
classical DFT is the Mermin theorem18, which extends
the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem19 to non-zero temperature,
stating that

A(T ) = min

F [n(r), T ] +

n(r) (cid:26)

Vext(r)n(r)dr

(cid:27)

Z

,

(1)

where A(T ) is the Helmholtz free energy of a system in
the external potential Vext at temperature T , n(r) is the
density of atoms or molecules, and F [n(r), T ] is a uni-
versal free-energy functional for the ﬂuid, which is inde-
pendent of the external potential Vext. Classical DFT
is a natural framework for creating a more ﬂexible the-
ory of hydrophobicity that can readily describe interac-
tion of water with arbitrary external potentials—such as
potentials describing strong interactions with solutes or
surfaces.

A number of exact properties are easily achieved in
the density-functional framework, such as the contact-
value theorem, which ensures a correct excess chemical
potential for small hard solutes. Much of the research
on classical density-functional theory has focused on the
hard-sphere ﬂuid20–25, which has led to a number of so-
phisticated functionals, such as the fundamental-measure
theory (FMT) functionals21–26. These functionals are en-
tirely expressed as an integral of local functions of a few
convolutions of the density (fundamental measures) that
can be eﬃciently computed. We will use the White Bear
version of the FMT functional26. This functional reduces
to the Carnahan-Starling equation of state in the homo-
geneous limit, and it reproduces the exact free energy in
the strongly-conﬁned limit of a small cavity.

A number of classical density functionals have been
developed for water27–39, each of which captures some of
the qualitative behavior of water. However, each of these
functionals also fail to capture some of water’s unique
properties. For instance, the functional of Lischner et
al 36 treats the surface tension correctly, but can only be
used at room temperature, and thus captures none of

 
 
 
 
 
 
the temperature-dependence of water. A functional by
Chuev and Skolov35 uses an ad hoc modiﬁcation of FMT
that can predict hydrophobic hydration near tempera-
tures of 298 K, but does not produce a correct equation
of state due to their method producting a high value
for pressure. A number of classical density function-
als have recently been produced that are based on Sta-
tistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT)30–32,34,37,39–43.
These functionals are based on a perturbative thermo-
dynamic expansion, and do reproduce the temperature-
dependence of water’s properties.

B. Statistical associating ﬂuid theory

Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) is a the-
ory describing complex ﬂuids in which hydrogen bonding
plays a signiﬁcant role41. SAFT is used to accurately
model the equations of state of both pure ﬂuids and
mixtures over a wide range of temperatures and pres-
sures. SAFT is based on Wertheim’s ﬁrst-order thermo-
dynamic perturbation theory (TPT1)44–47, which allows
it to account for strong associative interactions between
molecules.

The SAFT Helmholtz free energy is composed of ﬁve

terms:

F = Fid + Fhs + Fdisp + Fassoc + Fchain,

(2)

where the ﬁrst three terms—ideal gas, hard-sphere repul-
sion and dispersion—encompass the monomer contribu-
tion to the free energy, the fourth is the association free
energy, describing hydrogen bonds, and the ﬁnal term is
the chain formation energy for ﬂuids that are chain poly-
mers. While a number of formulations of SAFT have
been published, we will focus on SAFT-VR48, which was
used by Clark et al to construct an optimal SAFT model
for water34. All but one of the six empirical parameters
used in the functional introduced in this paper are taken
directly from this Clark et al paper. As an example of the
power of this model, it predicts an enthalpy of vaporiza-
tion at 100◦C of ∆Hvap= 39.41 kJ/mol, compared with
the experimental value ∆Hvap= 40.65 kJ/mol49, with an
error of only a few percent. We show a phase diagram for
this optimal SAFT model for water in Figure 1, which
demonstrates that its vapor pressure as a function of tem-
perature is very accurate, while the liquid density shows
larger discrepancies. The critical point is very poorly de-
scribed, which is a common failing of models that are
based on a mean-ﬁeld expansion.

SAFT has been used to construct classical density
functionals, which are often used to study the surface
tension as a function of temperature29–34,37–39,42,43. Such
functionals have qualitatively predicted the dependence
of surface tension on temperature, but they also overesti-
mate the surface tension by about 50%, and most SAFT-
based functionals are unsuited for studying systems that
have density variations on a molecular length scale due to
the use of a local density approximation30–32,34,38,39,42,43.

including experimental pressure data from NIST49. The solid
colored lines indicate the computationally calculated pressure
and the dotted colored lines are NIST data points. The solid
and dotted black lines represent the theoretical and experi-
mental coexistence curves.

Functionals constructed using a local density approx-
imation fail to satisfy the contact-value theorem, and
therefore incorrectly model small hard solutes. The
contact-value theorem states that the pressure any ﬂuid
exerts on a hard wall interface is proportional to the con-
tact density of the ﬂuid50:

p = nckBT,

(3)

where nc is the contact density, kB is the Boltzmann
constant and T is the temperature of the ﬂuid. This leads
to the property that the excess chemical potential of a
small hard solute is proportional to the solvent-excluded
volume:

F = nkBT V.

(4)

The contact-value theorem is satisﬁed by classical density
functionals in which the only purely local term is the ideal
gas contribution to the free energy, and conversely, this
theorem is not satisﬁed by functionals built using a local
density approximation.

II. THEORY AND METHODS

We construct a classical density functional for water,
which reduces in the homogeneous limit to the opti-
mal SAFT model for water found by Clark et al. The
Helmholtz free energy is constructed using the ﬁrst four
terms from Equation 2: Fid, Fhs, Fdisp and Fassoc.
In
the following sections, we will introduce the terms of this
functional.

 
A.

Ideal gas functional

The ﬁrst term is the ideal gas free energy functional,

which is purely local:

where n(r) is the density of water molecules and nQ is
the quantum concentration

nQ =

.

(6)

The ideal gas free energy functional on its own satisﬁes
the contact value theorem and its limiting case of small
solutes (Equations 3 and 4). These properties are re-
tained by our total functional, since all the remaining
terms are purely nonlocal.

B. Hard-sphere repulsion

We treat the hard-sphere repulsive interactions us-
ing the White Bear version of the Fundamental-Measure
Theory (FMT) functional for the hard-sphere ﬂuid26.
FMT functionals are expressed as the integral of the fun-
damental measures of a ﬂuid, which provide local mea-
sures of quantities such as the ﬁlling fraction, density of
spheres touching a given point and mean curvature. The
hard-sphere excess free energy is written as:

Fhs[n] = kBT

The density n3 is the ﬁlling fraction and n2 describes
the number of spheres touching a given point. For our
functional for water, we use the hard-sphere radius of
3.03420 ˚A, which was found to be optimal by Clark et
al.34

C. Dispersion free energy

The dispersion free energy includes the van der Waals
attraction and any orientation-independent interactions.
We use a dispersion term based on the SAFT-VR
approach48, which has two free parameters (taken from
Clark et al 34): an interaction energy ǫd and a length scale
λdR.

The SAFT-VR dispersion free energy has the form48

Fdisp[n] =

Z

(a1(r) + βa2(r)) n(r)dr,

(17)

where a1 and a2 are the ﬁrst two terms in a high-
temperature perturbation expansion and β = 1/kBT .
The ﬁrst term, a1, is the mean-ﬁeld dispersion interac-
tion. The second term, a2, describes the eﬀect of ﬂuctu-
ations resulting from compression of the ﬂuid due to the
dispersion interaction itself, and is approximated using
the local compressibility approximation (LCA), which
assumes the energy ﬂuctuation is simply related to the
compressibility of a hard-sphere reference ﬂuid51.

The form of a1 and a2 for SAFT-VR is given in ref-
erence48, expressed in terms of the ﬁlling fraction.
In
order to apply this form to an inhomogeneous density
distribution, we construct an eﬀective local ﬁlling frac-
tion for dispersion ηd, given by a Gaussian convolution
of the density:

ηd(r) =

This eﬀective ﬁlling fraction is used throughout the dis-
persion functional, and represents a ﬁlling fraction aver-
aged over the eﬀective range of the dispersive interaction.
Here we have introduced an additional empirical param-
eter sd which modiﬁes the length scale over which the
dispersion interaction is correlated.

D. Association free energy

The ﬁnal attractive energy term is the association
term, which accounts for hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen
bonds are modeled as four attractive patches (“associa-
tion sites”) on the surface of the hard sphere. These four
sites represent two protons and two electron lone pairs.
There is an attractive energy ǫa when two molecules are
oriented such that the proton of one overlaps with the
lone pair of the other. The volume over which this inter-
action occurs is κa, giving the association term in the free

energy two empirical parameters that are ﬁt to the ex-
perimental equation of state of water (again, taken from
Clark et al 34).

The association functional we use is a modiﬁed ver-
sion of Yu and Wu40, which includes the eﬀects of den-
sity inhomogeneities in the contact value of the correla-
tion function gHS
σ , but is based on the SAFT-HS model,
rather than the SAFT-VR model48, which is used in the
optimal SAFT parametrization for water of Clark et al 34.
Adapting Yu and Wu’s association free energy to SAFT-
VR simply involves the addition of a correction term in
the correlation function (see Equation 23).

The association functional we use is constructed by us-
ing the density n0(r), which is the density of hard spheres
touching a given point, in the standard SAFT-VR as-
sociation energy48. The association free energy for our
four-site model has the form

FIG. 2. Comparison of Surface tension versus temperature for
theoretical and experimental data. The experimental data is
taken from NIST.49 The length-scaling parameter sd is ﬁt so
that the theoretical surface tension will match the experimen-
tal surface tension near room temperature.

the
SAFT model contains ﬁve empirical parameters:
hard-sphere radius, an energy and length scale for the
dispersion interaction, and an energy and length scale
for the association interaction.
In addition to the ﬁve
empirical parameters of Clark et al, we add a single ad-
ditional dimensionless parameter sd—with a ﬁtted value
of 0.353—which determines the length scale over which
the density is averaged when computing the dispersion
free energy and its derivative. We determine this ﬁ-
nal parameter by ﬁtting the to the experimental sur-
face tension with the result shown in Figure 2. Because
the SAFT model of Clark et al overestimates the criti-
cal temperature—which is a common feature of SAFT-
based functionals that do not explicitly treat the critical
point—we cannot reasonably describe the surface tension
at all temperatures, and choose to ﬁt the surface tension
at and around room temperature.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. One hydrophobic rod

We begin by studying a single hydrophobic rod im-
mersed in water. In Figure 3 we show the excess chemi-
cal potential at room temperature, scaled by the solvent-
accessible surface area of the hard rod, plotted as a func-
tion of hard-rod radius. We deﬁne the hard-rods radius
as the radius from which water is excluded. For rods with
radius larger than 0.5 nm or so, this reaches a maximum
value of 75 mN/m, which is slightly higher than the bulk
surface. In the limit of very large rods, this value will
decrease and approach the bulk surface value. As seen
in the inset of Fig. 3, for rods with very small radius
(less than about 0.5 ˚A) the excess chemical potential is

theorem (see Equation 4).

We show in Figure 4 density proﬁles for diﬀerent radii
rods, as well as the prediction for the contact value of
the density as a function of rod radius, as computed from
the free energies plotted in Figure 3. The agreement be-
tween these curves conﬁrms that our functional satisﬁes
the contact-value theorem and that our minimization is
well converged. As expected, as the radius of the rods be-
comes zero the contact density approaches the bulk den-
sity, and as the radius becomes large, the contact density
will approach the vapor density.

Density proﬁles illustrating the transition from
vapor to liquid water between the rods. The radius is 0.6 nm,
the top ﬁgure is at a separation of 0.6 nm and the bottom
is 0.7 nm. Figure 6 shows the energy for these and other
separations.

B. Hydrophobic interaction of two rods

We now look at the more interesting problem of two
parallel hard rods in water, separated by a distance d,
as shown in Figure 5. At small separations there is only
vapor between the rods, but as the rods are pulled apart,
the vapor region expands until a critical separation is
reached at which point liquid water ﬁlls the region be-
tween the rods. Figure 5 shows density proﬁles before
and after this transition for rods of radius 0.6 nm. This
critical separation for the transition to liquid depends on
the radii of the rods, and is about 0.65 nm for the rods
shown in Figure 5. The critical separation will be diﬀer-
ent for a system where there is attraction between the
rods and water. At small separations, the shape of the
water around the two rods makes them appear as one
solid “stadium”-shaped object (a rectangle with semi-
circles on both ends).

To understand this critical separation, we consider the

free energy in the macroscopic limit, which is given by

F = γA + pV.

(25)

The ﬁrst term describes the surface energy and the sec-
ond term is the work needed to create a cavity of volume
V . Since the pressure term scales with volume, it can be
neglected relative to the surface term provided the length
scale is small compared with γ/p, which is around 20 µm,
and is much larger than any of the systems we study. For
micron-scale rods, the water on the sides of the ‘stadium’

The transition corresponds to the phase change from vapor

conﬁguration will bow inward between the rods and the
density will reduce to vapor near the center point where
the rods are closest to each other.

Starting from the surface energy term, we can calculate
the free energy per length, which is equal to the circum-
ference multiplied by the surface tension. The force per
length is the derivative of this with respect to the sepa-
ration. The circumference of the stadium-shape is

Cs = 2πr + 4r + 2d

(26)

and so the force per length is equal to twice the surface
tension.

We plot in Figure 6 the computed free energy of in-
teraction per unit length from our classical density func-
tional (solid lines), as a function of the separation d, along
with the free energy predicted by our simple macroscopic
model (dashed lines). The models agree very well on the
force between the two rods at close separations, and have
reasonable agreement as to the critical separation for rods
greater than 0.5 nm in radius.

Walther et al 52 studied the interactions between two
carbon nanotubes, which are geometrically similar to our
hydrophobic rods, using molecular dynamics with the
SPC model for water, and a Lennard-Jones potential for
the interaction of carbon with water, for nanotubes of
diameter 1.25 nm and separations ranging from about
0.3 nm to 1.5 nm. The SPC model underestimates the
surface tension of water by about 24%53, so we cannot
expect this work to provide quantitative agreement with
real water. Walther et al observe a drying transition
between the two nanotubes, which occurs at a smaller
radius than our results suggest. However, when Walther
et al disable the attractive interaction between nanotube

and water, the drying eﬀect occurs at much longer range,
in agreement with our results.

C. Hydrophobic interactions of four rods

We go on to study four parallel hard rods, as examined
by Lum, Chandler and Weeks in their classic paper on
hydrophobicity at small and large length scales10. As in
the case of two rods—and as predicted by Lum et al —
we observe a drying transition, as seen the density plot
shown in Figure 8. In Figure 7, we plot the free energy
of interaction together with the macroscopic approxima-
tion, and ﬁnd good agreement for rods larger than 0.5 nm
in radius. This free energy plot is qualitatively similar to
that predicted by the LCW theory10, with the diﬀerence
that we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant barrier to the association of
four rods.

D. Hydration energy of hard-sphere solutes

A common model of hydrophobic solutes is the hard-
sphere solute, which is the simplest possible solute, and
serves as a test case for understanding of hydrophobic
solutes in water55. As in the single rod, we begin by
examining the ratio of the excess chemical potential of
the cavity system to the solvent-accessible surface area
(Figure 9). This eﬀective surface tension surpasses the
bulk surface tension at a radius of almost 1 nm, and at
large radius will drop to the bulk value. As with the sin-
gle rod, we see the analytically correct behavior in the
limit of small solutes. For comparison, we plot the free
energy calculated using a molecular dynamics simulation

of SPC/E water54. The agreement is quite good, apart
from the issue that the SPC/E model for water signiﬁ-
cantly underestimates the surface bulk tension of water
at room temperature53.

Figure 10 shows the density proﬁle for several hard
sphere radii, plotted together with the results of the
same SPC/E molecular dynamics simulation shown in
Figure 954. The agreement with simulation is quite rea-
sonable. The largest disagreement involves the density
at contact, which according to the contact value theorem
cannot agree, since the free energies do not agree.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have developed a classical density functional
for water that combines SAFT with the fundamental-
measure theory for hard spheres, using one additional
empirical parameter beyond those in the SAFT equation
of state, which is used to match the experimental surface
tension. This functional does not make a local density
approximation, and therefore correctly models water at

both small and large length scales. In addition, like all
FMT functionals, this functional is expressed entirely in
terms of convolutions of the density, which makes it eﬃ-
cient to compute and minimize.

We apply this functional to the case of hard hydropho-
bic rods and spheres in water. For systems of two or
four hydrophobic rods surrounded by water, we see a
transition from a vapor-ﬁlled state a liquid-ﬁlled state.
A simple model treatment for the critical separation for
this transition works well for rods with diameters larger

 
 
 
 
 
 
than 1 nm. In the case of spherical solutes, we ﬁnd good

agreement with SPC/E simulations.
