Abstract

In this study, we explore how spatial conﬁgurations can be reﬂected in determining the threshold range of Rel-
ative Translation Gains (RTGs), a translation gain-based Redirected Walking (RDW) technique that scales the
user’s movement in Virtual Reality (VR) in different ratios for width and depth. While previous works have
shown that various cognitive factors or individual differences inﬂuence the RDW threshold, constructive stud-
ies investigating the impact of the environmental composition on the RDW threshold with regard to the user’s
visual perception were lacking. Therefore, we examined the effect of spatial conﬁgurations on the RTG thresh-
old by analyzing the participant’s responses and gaze distribution data in two user studies. The ﬁrst study
concerned the size of the virtual room and the existence of objects within it, and the second study focused
on the combined impact of room size and the spatial layout. Our results show that three compositions of spa-
tial conﬁguration (size, object existence, spatial layout) signiﬁcantly affect the RTG threshold range. Based
on our ﬁndings, we proposed virtual space rescaling guidelines to increase the range of adjustable movable
space with RTGs for developers: placing distractors in the room, setting the perceived movable space to be
larger than the adjusted movable space if it’s an empty room, and avoid placing objects together as centered
layout. Our ﬁndings can be used to adaptively rescale VR users’ space according to the target virtual space’s
conﬁguration with a uniﬁed coordinate system that enables the utilization of physical objects in a virtual scene.

1 Introduction

Since COVID-19, remote collaboration has become
commonplace, and an avatar-based telepresence sys-
tem using Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality
(AR) Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) is drawing

attention as a means to provide immersion and co-
presence between users (Kim et al., 2021b, Orts-
Escolano et al., 2016, Piumsomboon et al., 2018). In
most cases, the virtual space accessed by the VR client
is more expansive and different from the tracked space
in which the user physically exists. To overcome this

limitation, Redirected Walking (RDW), which trans-
forms users’ locomotion in VR to a level that users
do not notice, was proposed (Razzaque et al., 2005).
Most RDW techniques utilize rotation gain, which
can achieve a more signiﬁcant effect on expanding
explorable space than the translation gain (Dong et al.,
2020, Strauss et al., 2020, Williams et al., 2021a). Nev-
ertheless, it is challenging to utilize objects and walls
in real space with rotation-based RDW on account of
the distortion of coordinate systems between real and
virtual spaces. On the other hand, the translation gain-
based RDW can generate a uniﬁed coordinate system
between the virtual space and the tracked space while
rescaling the VR space. Relative Translation Gains
(RTGs), a translation gain-based RDW that transforms
the horizontal and vertical ratios of space differently,
have been proposed to transform virtual spaces while
maintaining a uniﬁed coordinate system (Kim et al.,
2021a).

As RDW technologies transform the users’ per-
ceived locomotion in VR, it is necessary to modify
redirecting values within the threshold range where
users do not signiﬁcantly notice the difference in their
movement (Grechkin et al., 2016, Steinicke et al.,
2010). Since RDW technology visually changes the
users’ movement, the threshold range varies depend-
ing on the subjects’ visual cognition factors in a virtual
environment. Previous studies conﬁrmed that subjects
underestimate their speed in a virtual environment (Ash
et al., 2013, Banton et al., 2005, Bruder et al., 2012,
Caramenti et al., 2018). Moreover, users’ individual
differences and the presence of cognitive tasks while
they are walking also affect the RDW threshold (Bruder
et al., 2015, Rietzler et al., 2018, Sakono et al., 2021,
Williams and Peck, 2019). Although the purpose of
RDW is to match a physical tracked space with a virtual
target space, there was a lack of research systematically
summarizing how RDW thresholds are affected by the
conﬁguration of virtual spaces.

In this study, we analyzed users’ responses about
their perceived speed and gaze information to reveal
how the RTG threshold is affected by the conﬁguration
of virtual space. Based on our previous work on the
effect of size and objects on RTG threshold (Kim et al.,
2022) (Study 1), we conducted an additional study
(Study 2) focusing on the spatial layout of the virtual
space to expand upon the implications of its ﬁndings
and conduct an integrated analysis on how spatial con-
ﬁgurations affect the range of RTG thresholds. In Study
1, RTG thresholds were estimated under a total of six
spatial conditions depending on the size of the virtual

space and the presence or absence of objects (3 × 2)
which were conﬁgured by differing Angles of Decli-
nation (AoDs) between the user’s gaze and the virtual
horizon. In Study 2, we estimated the RTG threshold
under eight spatial conditions according to the size of
the virtual space and the spatial layout (2 × 4) and
analyzed the changes in gaze according to the virtual
space conﬁguration through AoD distribution and gaze
heatmap.

Our results conﬁrmed that all three components of
spatial conﬁguration (size, object presence, spatial lay-
out) signiﬁcantly affected the RTG threshold range. In
Study 1, the RTG threshold range was greater in the
largest size condition than in two smaller size condi-
tions, and the RTG threshold range further increased in
the furnished room than in the empty one. In Study 2,
the RTG threshold range was greater in the scattered
layout than in the centered layout. In connection with
the results of examining AoD data, we conﬁrmed that
the AoD distribution decreased as the size of the empty
room increased. Moreover, even though the placement
of objects lowered the AoD distribution, the effect of
the object as a distractor had a more signiﬁcant effect
on the RTG threshold range than the size of the virtual
space. The gaze heatmap examined in Study 2 shows
that when objects are gathered into a single cluster, they
act as a guide to help subjects recognize their perceived
speed in VR, leading to the RTG threshold range being
lower in the centered layout than in the empty virtual
room.

Through this study, we investigated the effect of
the spatial conﬁguration of VR room on translation-
based RDW threshold. In addition, the user’s gaze data
and the subject’s response were analyzed together to
more quantitatively analyze the tendency of the user’s
gaze distribution to vary depending on the conﬁgura-
tion of the virtual space and the effect on the RTG
threshold. Our ﬁndings could be used to adaptively
expand and transform VR users’ tracked space accord-
ing to the spatial conﬁguration of the target virtual
environment. We derived three virtual space rescaling
guidelines for increasing the range of adjustable mov-
able space with the RTG by synthesizing our results.
First of all, placing disctractors in the virtual room
to increase the adjustable movable space. Second, for
empty spaces, set the perceived movable space to be
larger than the adjusted movable space. Lastly, avoid
placing objects where they are constantly in a user’s
sight. Through our discovery, developers could set a
suitable range of RTG according to the spatial conﬁg-
uration of the virtual room and rescale the VR user’s

space to ﬁt the target virtual space, adaptively. Further-
more, the space modiﬁcation with RTG could maintain
the coordinate system between physical and virtual
space, so it can also be used for XR remote collabora-
tion where AR/VR users from heterogeneous spaces
are co-located in a mutual space.

2 Background

2.1 Redirected Walking

Redirected Walking (RDW) is a VR locomotion tech-
nique that allows users to explore a more expansive
virtual space with natural walking from the limited
tracked space of VR users (Nilsson et al., 2018, Raz-
zaque et al., 2005, Ropelato et al., 2021). RDW utilizes
three types of gain: rotation gain that deforms the angle,
translation gain that deforms the speed, and curva-
ture gain that deforms through applying offset. Various
RDW controllers have been suggested to utilize these
RDW gains to allow users to walk around an ample
virtual space. The steer-to-center (S2C) method directs
the user to the center of the tracked space, steer-to-
orbit (S2O) that redirects the user to a speciﬁc orbit,
and steer-to-multi-target (S2OT) that directs to mul-
tiple targets were frequently used as baseline RDW
controllers (Chen et al., 2018, Hodgson and Bachmann,
2013). In addition to directing users with such a ﬁxed
target, Strauss et al. proposed RDW with reinforcement
learning (Chen et al., 2021, Strauss et al., 2020), and
Williams et al. suggested space-adaptive RDW con-
trollers by comparing the layout of real and virtual
spaces in real-time (Williams et al., 2021a,b). Dong
et al. (Dong et al., 2017) introduced Smooth Assem-
bly Mapping (SAM) to decompose ample virtual space
and assemble them to the tracked space. Moreover,
RDW controllers for multiple users were proposed
to enable collaborative scenarios with RDW (Dong
et al., 2020, Lee et al., 2020). Recently, RDW libraries
that can compare each performance of RDW con-
trollers were also presented to strive for practical use
of RDW (Azmandian et al., 2016, Li et al., 2021).

When comparing the performance of the RDW
controllers introduced earlier, most of them use
the increased movable distance through their RDW
methods and the number of resets when a colli-
sion occurs (Li et al., 2021, Strauss et al., 2020).
These measurements are not surprising because the
RDW controller’s primary goal is to allow users to
travel around virtual spaces larger than their tracked
space (Bozgeyikli et al., 2019, Langbehn et al., 2017).

However, another potential of RDW is that the semantic
information between real and virtual spaces can also be
matched when the coordinate systems of the two spaces
are aligned, which means that physical components
in the real space can be utilized in VR. Furthermore,
since RDW using translation gain only controls per-
ceived speed (Interrante et al., 2007, Kim et al., 2021a,
Selzer et al., 2022), it can be used to rescale the virtual
space while maintaining the coordinate system between
the physical and virtual space. Therefore, this study
focused on the adaptive application of RDW that can
match the virtual space with the user’s actual space.

2.2 Cognitive Threshold and Visual

Perception

As RDW visually adjusts VR users’ locomotion in
VR, the redirecting gain value should be varied within
the threshold range where they do not notice a signif-
icant change in their moving speed. Since Steinicke
et al. (Steinicke et al., 2010) ﬁrst estimated the
RDW threshold, several studies have revisited the
rotational, translational, and curvature gain threshold
range (Grechkin et al., 2016, Rietzler et al., 2018,
Zhang et al., 2018). Previous studies have shown that
users tend to underestimate their speed when walking
in a virtual environment while wearing VR HMDs (Ash
et al., 2013, Banton et al., 2005, Bruder et al., 2012,
Caramenti et al., 2018). Therefore, it is possible to
transform users to move faster and wander around a
more expansive space. Although RDW techniques uti-
lize the user’s visual perception in VR, various factors
affect on RDW threshold range, such as the visual com-
positions of VEs and the sense of embodiment (Kruse
et al., 2018, Neth et al., 2012, Nguyen et al., 2020, Palu-
dan et al., 2016). In addition, the cognitive threshold
range is also affected by the hardware capability of VR
HMD, such as the Field of View (FoV) (Williams and
Peck, 2019).

In particular, the RDW threshold value is affected
by parameters related to cognitive ability in VR. When
applying RDW to the user, gradually increasing the
RDW gain value can change their locomotion more
than the initially recognized range (Neth et al., 2012,
Sakono et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2014). Moreover,
it is inﬂuenced by events occurring in virtual reality
space. For example, when performing other tasks while
walking, the user’s attention was distributed to the task
performance, making them less sensitive to changes in
their speed (Ciumedean et al., 2020, Gao et al., 2020).

A study also shows that events in VR can act as dis-
tractors, dispersing users’ attention and enlarging the
transformable range (Cools and Simeone, 2019, Kim
et al., 2022, Williams and Peck, 2019). In order to
adaptively transform space into a virtual environment,
research on the effect of the composition of virtual
space on RDW is required. Nguyen et al. (Nguyen
et al., 2018)’s study shows that the size of the virtual
environment did not affect the threshold of curvature
gain. In contrast, Kim et al. (Kim et al., 2021a) show
that the translation gain threshold range increased in
the larger virtual space. Even though the purpose of
RDW is to match the tracked space to the virtual target
space, studies focused on the effects of the spatial con-
ﬁguration of virtual space on the RDW threshold range
were lacking.

2.3 Relative Translation Gains

We proposed Relative Translation Gains (RTGs) to
adaptively transform VR user’s space by adjusting the
user’s speed in virtual space by applying different trans-
lation gain values to width and depth, respectively (Kim
et al., 2021a). Unlike other RDW controllers that con-
tinuously change the gain values to redirect a user,
RTG is applied only once according to the target space,
which has less impact on possible VR simulator sick-
ness than other RDW methods. The threshold range of
RTG is deﬁned through αT , which is the ratio of the two
translation gains in a single pair of relative translation
gains and is expressed by the following formula:

(1)

αT =

gT,x
gT,y
where gT,x is the VR environment’s x-axis trans-
lation gain, and gT,y is the VR environment’s y-axis
translation gain used as the reference translation gain.
The RTG threshold range is deﬁned as the value
between the maximum 2D translation ratio and the min-
imum 2D translation ratio. By utilizing two translation
ratio values and the translation gain threshold range
from Steinicke et al. (Steinicke et al., 2010) ’s study
together, the moving speed can be adjusted at differ-
ent ratios for the two axes in virtual reality. Through
RTG application, the shape of the virtual space can
be deformed more adaptively according to the target
virtual space’s conﬁguration.

As RTG was proposed to transform movable space
by controlling the user’s speed in VR, studies should
be conducted on how virtual space components affect
the thresholds. When we ﬁrst proposed RTG and esti-
mated the threshold range, we experimentally revealed

that the threshold range increased in a large-sized vir-
tual room than in the smaller one (Kim et al., 2021a).
Furthermore, we discussed the different locations of
the virtual horizon according to the size of the virtual
room affecting the subjects’ visual perception of their
walking speed (Messing and Durgin, 2005). Based
on previous ﬁndings, we wanted to reveal how the
subject’s gaze distribution varies depending on the
composition of the virtual space and how it relates to
the RTG threshold. In this study, we focused on inte-
grating fragmented implications about the effects of
virtual space on the RTG threshold range to structurally
explore the effect of virtual space conﬁguration on RTG
thresholds and propose a method of adapting RTG for
space modiﬁcation.

3 Methodology

3.1 Research Questions and Hypothesis

This study aims to investigate the effect of the virtual
space’s conﬁguration on the user’s cognitive threshold
when adjusting their speed using Relative Transla-
tion Gains (RTGs) and derives guidelines on utilizing
RTGs as a spatial deformation component. We exam-
ined three factors of spatial conﬁguration: the size of
the space, the existence of objects, and spatial layout.
Based on previous studies (Kim et al., 2021a, 2022)
that found user’s visual perception changes according
to the size and presence or absence of objects that affect
the RTG threshold range and gaze distribution, we set
our research questions as follows:

RQ1. How do conﬁgurations of the virtual space affect
the threshold range of relative translation gains?
RQ2. How do conﬁgurations of the virtual space affect

the subjects’ gaze distribution?

To answer these research questions, we conducted
two studies to derive structured guidelines for adap-
tively setting the RTG threshold range according to the
spatial conﬁguration. We utilized our previous study
results (Study 1) (Kim et al., 2022) and conducted a
new study focused on spatial conﬁguration (Study 2)
to derive more structured guidelines for adaptively set-
ting the RTG threshold range according to the spatial
conﬁguration. Study 1 was conducted for six condi-
tions according to three room sizes (Large, Medium,
Small) and the existence or absence of objects (Empty,
Furnished). Since six conditions in Study 1 eventually
changes the visibility level of space, we selected spatial

layout as a variable to ﬁnd out more about the impact of
visibility on RTG threshold. Study 2 was conducted for
eight conditions according to two room sizes (Large,
Small) and four spatial layouts (Empty, Centered, Scat-
tered, Peripheral). Through Study 2, we examined
the effect of various spatial layouts conﬁgured by the
arrangement of objects on the RTG threshold in a real-
istic scenario. Two size conditions from Study 1 (Small,
Large) were used in Study 2 to compare the results
between the two studies. In the case of spatial layout,
we chose four spatial layouts to change the visibility
level of each virtual space.

Based on our previous results that participants
were less sensitive to being faster in a larger virtual
room (Kim et al., 2021a), we could set our ﬁrst hypoth-
esis about the room size. Moreover, we referred to
Shin et al. (Shin et al., 2021)’s study to distinguish the
level of visibility between four layout conditions to
set our hypothesis about spatial layout. We assumed
that the spatial layout with low visibility might distract
users’ attention more and make users less sensitive
to being faster. For the last hypothesis about AoD,
we assumed that the AoD distribution in the smaller
room is lower than in the large one because the smaller
room has a lower virtual horizon (Messing and Durgin,
2005). Finally, we could complete the following three
hypotheses:

H1. The probabilities of “faster” responses to all rel-
ative translation gains will be lower in the large
size conditions than in smaller conditions.
H2. The probabilities of “faster” responses to all rela-
tive translation gains will be lower in the spatial
layouts with low visibility.

H3. The medians of AoD from participants will be
lower in the large size conditions than in smaller
conditions.

3.2 Study Design

3.2.1 Study 1: Size × Object Existence

We used three out of ﬁve paths used in a previous
study (Kim et al., 2021a), taking into account the loca-
tion of objects in the Furnished condition. Fig. 2 shows
the three pathways we used in our study. Subjects
repeatedly performed the walking task in sequence
from Path 1 to Path 3. Through Path 1 and Path 2,
participants experienced maximum and minimum trans-
lation gains. In Path 3, they experienced the square

Fig. 1 The Angle of Declination (AoD) between the participant’s
eye-gaze and forward-gaze. Forward-gaze refers to the orthogonal
projection vector of the eye-gaze.

mean of the maximum and minimum translation gains.
We ﬁxed the reference translation gain (gT,y) at 1.0.
To estimate 2D translation ratio, another axis’s trans-
lation gain (gT,x) was set at 0.825, 0.875, or 0.925
for minimum ratio, and 1.15, 1.2, or 1.25 for maxi-
mum ratio. These six relative translation gains were
randomly ordered and repeated seven times with the
Latin-squared method for within-counterbalancing.

As shown in Fig. 1, the AoD (θAoD) between eye-
gaze and the forward-gaze can be measured from the
position of the eye-gazed point (Pgaze) and the posi-
tion of the eye (Peye). We can calculate θAoD with the
following formula:

θAoD = arctan(

ygaze − yeye
(cid:112)(xgaze − xeye)2 + (zgaze − zeye)2

)

(2)
where the position of the eye-gazed point is Pgaze
= (xgaze, ygaze, zgaze) and the position of the eye is Peye
= (xeye, yeye, zeye). Three size conditions were gener-
ated to differing average AoD values, and the location

of objects was also set to differing the AoD distri-
bution (Kim et al., 2022). Fig. 3 shows three size
conditions and two object layouts used in Study 1.
Three room sizes (Large, Medium, Small) and two
object layouts (Empty, Furnished) were combined to
generate six experimental conditions for estimating
RTG thresholds, as shown in Fig. 4. Moreover, we
added two conditions without RTG to determine the
effect of RTG on VR Simulator Sickness Questionnaire
(SSQ) scores (Kennedy et al., 1993). Our previous
study (Kim et al., 2021a) found that post-SSQ was
higher in a larger virtual space, so we chose the Large
condition to observe the effect of RTG on the VR SSQ
score. We generated eight experimental conditions as
follows: Small × Empty, Medium × Empty, Large ×
Empty, Large × Empty (No RTGs), Small × Furnished,
Medium × Furnished, Large × Furnished, Large ×
Furnished (No RTGs).

3.2.2 Study 2: Size × Spatial Layout

In Study 2, we examined the effect of spatial layout
according to object placement on the RTG thresh-
old range. The experiment employed a mixed-subject
method with the size of the virtual room as the between-
subject variable and the spatial layout of the VR room
as the within-subject variable. In designing the exper-
iment conditions for Study 2, we decided to use two
size conditions (Small, Large) from Study 1 as shown
in Fig. 5 (A). To analyze the effect of spatial layout
on RTG thresholds, we decided to reduce the number
of objects compared to Study 1. This is because when
objects are placed densely, it is highly likely that they
may distract users’ attention regardless of the spatial
layout they conﬁgured. To construct a realistic virtual
space that is relatively less crowded, we assumed an
exhibition room set-up consisting of four exhibition
stands with 3D spacecraft models with similar volumes
placed on them. This was to minimize the difference

between each set of objects, whose locations deter-
mined the spatial layout so that the level of distraction
caused by their existence could be controlled.

In setting the spatial conditions, we visualized the
adjusted movable space by applying the concepts pro-
posed in Study 1 (Kim et al., 2022). The inner ﬂoor area
in the Large condition, which was the same size as the
entire ﬂoor area of the Small condition, was expressed
with different-colored tiles to show where subjects
could walk, as shown in Fig. 6 (A). In the Small condi-
tion, the perceived movable space was the same as the
adjusted movable space. Based on the Empty layout,
four exhibition stands were placed in different loca-
tions to create three spatial layouts, following Shin et
al. (Shin et al., 2021)’s study to set different levels of
visibility afforded in each space. We selected Periph-
eral, Scattered, and Centered layouts for corresponding
visibility levels: Low, Medium, and High. In the Periph-
eral condition, exhibition stands were placed at the
four corners of the adjusted movable space (Fig. 5 (B)
Peripheral). In the Scattered conditions, two exhibi-
tion stands were placed inside the walking path, which
was identical to Study 1, and the other two exhibition

stands were spread outside the path (Fig. 5 (B) Scat-
tered). Lastly, all four exhibition stands were gathered
inside the triangle created by the walking path in the
Centered layout (Fig. 5 (B) Centered). By combining
two size conditions (Small, Large) and four spatial
layouts (Empty, Peripheral, Scattered, Centered), we
generated eight experimental conditions to estimate the
RTG threshold range, as illustrated in Fig. 6.

3.3 System Implementation and Setup

Both studies were set up in an empty 6 m × 6 m
physical indoor space with four HTC VIVE base sta-
tions (v2.0) installed at the top corners. The subjects
wore an HTC VIVE Pro Eye with HTC VIVE wireless
adaptor. They held the VIVE controller in their hands
and used the controller to press a button in the virtual
scene. The virtual experience was operated using a
desktop computer consisting of an i9-10900K 3.70GHz
CPU, 128GB RAM, and a GeForce RTX 3090 24GB
GPU. To implement a virtual conference room envi-
ronment, we developed our system with Unity 3D
(v2019.3.7f1) and steam VR Plugin (v1.16.10). Every

virtual room condition was created from the same con-
ference room prefab. We employed SRanipal SDK and
TobiiXR Plugin to get each subject’s eye-tracking data.
We obtained the subject’s AoD through Equation 2,
which was approximately 36 θAoD samples per sec-
ond. From the accumulated AoD values, we extracted
AoD data obtained from each zone where users made
a change in their paths or stood at a ﬁxed position to
answer questionnaires. In Study 2, the location gazed
by the subjects on the entire virtual room was acquired
to draw the subjects’ gaze heatmap. In order to under-
stand the areas where the subjects frequently gazed, we
measured the time the users’ gazes hit the four walls,
ﬂoors, and objects, respectively. In particular, we mea-
sured the time users gaze at the inner and outer ﬂoor
areas separately in the Large size conditions to focus
more on the inner ﬂoor area where objects were placed.
We then used Heatmapper (Babicki et al., 2016) to draw
gaze heatmaps from the measured subjects’ gaze data.

3.4 Participants

In Study 1, we recruited 32 subjects through the local
university website and paid $ 20 in remuneration.
Twenty of them identiﬁed as male and 12 as female.
All subjects were at least 18 years old, and all had
normal vision or corrected to normal vision. The sub-
jects’ mean age was 23.81 (SD = 3.86), and their
mean interpupillary distance (IPD) of them was 64.17
(SD = 1.89). Most of them had a moderate level of
experience in HMD-mediated VR environments: 24
participants had worn VR HMDs up to ten times before
and four for more. Only four of them had no prior VR
experience. We separated subjects into two groups to
decrease fatigue and learning during experiments with
VR HMDs. We maintained the gender ratio among
the groups that might affect the cognitive threshold of
redirected walking (Williams and Peck, 2019). Further-
more, as we assumed the AoD distribution might affect
the threshold range, we balanced the average height
between the two groups. The detailed information of

the two groups that participated in Study 1 is shown in
Table 1.

In Study 2, the subjects were recruited through the
local university website and paid $20 in remuneration.
Of the 32 subjects, 16 identiﬁed as male and 16 as
female. All subjects were at least 18 years old, and
all had normal vision or corrected normal vision. The
mean age of the subjects was 22.97 (SD = 3.32), and
their mean interpupillary distance (IPD) of them was
64.01 (SD = 1.79). Most subjects had a moderate level
of experience in HMD-mediated VR environments: 23
subjects had worn VR HMDs up to ten times before
and four for more. Only ﬁve of them had no prior
experience. As in Study 1, we separated subjects into
two groups and balanced the average height and gender
ratio between the two groups, as shown in Table 2.

3.5 Tasks and Procedures

An Institutional Review Board approved the content
and procedures of both Study 1 and Study 2. Partici-
pants ﬁrst wore an HTC VIVE Pro Eye and held the
VIVE controller to complete an eye-tracking calibra-
tion session. They then conducted test trials before
the main study trials, which included walking along
the three given paths in sequential order. After they
walked along the three paths, they were asked to answer
whether their movements in the virtual environment
were “faster” or “slower” than in the real environment.
We used a pseudo-Two-Alternative Forced-Choice
(pseudo-2AFC), which is widely used for estimating
redirected walking threshold range (Grechkin et al.,
2016, Steinicke et al., 2010, Williams and Peck, 2019).
After the test trial, they took off the VR HMD and ﬁlled
out the pre-SSQ. Next, participants conducted the main
trials. They walk along the sequential path while expe-
riencing changes to their perceived speed between the
maximum and minimum translation gain values. They
repeated 42 trials (six relative translation gains × seven
repetitions) by pressing the “next” button. They were
permitted to take breaks whenever they wanted.

We created three different sizes of virtual rooms,
Large (17 m × 17 m), Medium (8.2 m × 8.2 m), and
Small (5.2 m × 5.2 m), as shown in the Fig. 3. We
set up six conditions by combining three size condi-
tions (Large, Medium, Small) with the presence of
objects (Furnished, Empty) as shown in Fig. 4. The four
conditions conducted in each participant group were
randomized and counterbalanced. Participants were
required to answer the post-SSQ after each condition
was completed. After they ﬁnished every condition,
they were subject to a short semi-structured inter-
view on how the VR room’s conﬁguration affected
their response to the questionnaire. Each group of
participants experienced 168 trials (42 trials × four
experimental conditions) and took approximately 15
minutes for each experimental condition. The total
duration of each study session was approximately two
hours.

The overall tasks and procedures of Study 2 were
the same as Study 1, except for the experimented con-
ditions in each group. Subject group 1 experienced four
spatial layout conditions (Empty, Centered, Peripheral,
Scattered) in a Large (17 m × 17 m) virtual room, and
the other group experienced four spatial layout con-
ditions (Empty, Centered, Peripheral, Scattered) from
Small (5.2 m × 5.2 m) virtual room.

4 Results

4.1 Statistic Results

We evaluated how the VR room size (Size) and object
presence (Object) affect the user’s relative translation
gain thresholds (Gain) by comparing the probabili-
ties of “faster” responses from our previous Study
1 (Kim et al., 2022) (Size: F(2, 490) = 16.690, p <
.001; Object: F(1, 490) = 60.984, p < .001). As shown
in Fig. 7, the mean value for the probability of “faster”
responses was signiﬁcantly lower in the Large room
than both the Medium and Small room for all six
relative translation gains (Large-Medium: p < .001;
Large-Small: p < .001). Moreover, the mean probabil-
ity value for the Furnished room was also signiﬁcantly
lower than for the Empty room across all gains (p <
.001).

We investigated how the VR room size (Size)
and spatial Layout (Layout) affect the user’s relative
translation gain thresholds (Gain) by comparing the
probabilities of “faster” responses in Study 2. Same as
Study 1, the ART for non-parametric factorial ANOVA

analysis (α = 0.05) was adapted to conduct the mul-
tivariate analysis within the within-subject factor of
Layout, the between-subject factor of Size, and the fac-
tor of Gain. The ART-C algorithm (Elkin et al., 2021)
was also used for the multifactor post hoc contrast
tests, and all pairwise comparisons were Bonferroni
corrected. Size consists of Large and Small, and Layout
consists of Empty, Centered, Peripheral, and Scat-
tered conditions described in Section 3.2.2. Six relative
translation gain factors represent the following pairs
of x-axis and y-axis translation gain value: Gain 1 =
(0.825, 1), Gain 2 = (0.875, 1), Gain 3 = (0.925, 1),
Gain 4 = (1.15, 1), Gain 5 = (1.20, 1), and Gain 6 =
(1.25, 1). We excluded four participants’ data as out-
liers; The two in the Small room condition and the
other two in the Large room condition were extreme
values or considered contaminated, recorded as zero.
We found signiﬁcant main effects of Layout
(F(3, 611) = 3.198, p = .023) and Gain (F(5, 611) =
228.642, p < .001). However, there was no signiﬁcant
main effects of Size (F(1, 611) = 3.157, p = .076) was
founded. The pairwise comparison revealed signiﬁcant
differences between pairs of Size condition: Centered
and Scattered (p = .035). However, a signiﬁcant dif-
ference was not shown between the other two pairs of
spatial layouts (all p > .05). We also found a signiﬁ-
cant interaction of Size and Layout (F(3, 611) = 2.941,
p = .033). The post hoc analysis revealed the signiﬁ-
cant differences between Large × Scattered and Small
× Centered (p = .003) and between Large × Periph-
eral and Small × Centered (p = .035). However, it was
not found any signiﬁcant differences in the pairs of
Size × Layout, nor signiﬁcant main interaction effects
between other factors (all p > .05). Therefore, as shown
in Fig. 8, we found that the mean value for the proba-
bility of “faster” responses was signiﬁcantly lower in
the Scattered Layout than in the Centered Layout for
all six relative translation gains. The mean probability
value in the Large × Scattered room was signiﬁcantly
lower than the Small × Centered room for all gains.
Moreover, the mean probability value in the Large ×
Peripheral room was signiﬁcantly lower than the Small
× Centered room for all gains.

4.2 Threshold Estimation

We plotted ﬁtted psychometric functions of mean esti-
mated threshold values from Study 1 and Study 2.

mented relative translation gains. The graph’s x-axis

shows the translation gain for the x-axis (gT,x) of the

is ﬁxed to 1.0. The graph’s y-axis shows the probabil-
ities of “faster” responses to the questionnaire, “Was
the virtual movement faster or slower than the physical
movement?”. We used a standard logistic psychomet-
ric function to ﬁt the data, and it can be represented as
follows:

The Point of Subjective Equality (PSE), the value
at which a user perceives the virtual speed to be iden-
tical to their actual speed, is obtained from the ﬁtted
psychometric functions. We used the 25% and 75%
criterion used from Steinicke et al. (Steinicke et al.,
2010) to estimate the RTG’s threshold value (2D trans-
lation ratio, αT ). αT,lower (minimum 2D translation
ratio) refers to a lower boundary of the threshold range,
and αT,upper (maximum 2D translation ratio) refers to
an upper boundary of the threshold range. When the

values from eight virtual room conditions in Study 2
were shown in Table 4. Results show the maximum
2D translation gain boundary value αT,upper in Large
× Scattered was higher than the Large conditions with
other spatial layouts. Moreover, we could found the
RTG threshold values from the Small × Centered
layout were lower than the Small × Empty layout.

4.3 Gaze Distribution

To answer our second research question (RQ2: How do
conﬁgurations of the virtual space affect the subjects’
gaze distribution?), we utilized the AoD distribution
graphs and gaze heatmap. Through the AoD distribu-
tion graph, we try to ﬁgure out the relationship between
the location of the virtual horizon and the RTG thresh-
old range. Moreover, we used a gaze heatmap in Study

2 to observe how the effect as a gaze distributor of
objects changes according to the spatial layout.

4.3.1 AoD Distribution

Fig. 10 shows the distribution of AoD according to
each virtual room’s conditions. Fig. 10 (A) are the dis-
tribution of AoD from Study 1 and Fig. 10 (B) are the
distribution of AoD from Study 2. The x-axis of the
AoD distribution graph is the AoD (θAoD) between the
user’s eye-gaze and the forward-gaze. The graph’s y-
axis shows the density of normalized AoD for each
subject. When a subject gaze straight forward while
they are walking, θAoD = 0◦. θAoD increases to a posi-
tive degree when they gaze upward, and on the contrary,
θAoD decreases to a negative degree when they gaze
downward. The AoD degree with high density means
subjects gaze to that particular AoD degree frequently.
As the AoD distribution graph aims to determine the
relationship between the virtual horizon and the RTG
threshold range, it is important to know how much the
subjects perceived the virtual horizon in corresponding
virtual room conditions. Humans typically recognize
about 10 degrees downward from the location of the
foveal area while they are walking (Hill and Kroemer,
1986), so we set the horizon-noticeable gaze area of
each room with this regulation. In the Small × Empty
condition, the average AoD was set to −20◦ so we set
the AoD area where the user could perceive the virtual
horizon to be −20◦ to −30◦. Similarly, the horizon-
noticeable gaze area in the Middle × Empty condition
was −10◦ to −20◦, and in the Large × Empty condi-
tions was 0◦ to −10◦. In Fig. 10, we highlighted the
AoD area of the Empty conditions where users could
perceive the virtual horizon. The colored area in Fig. 10
(C1) are the horizon-noticeable gaze area in Large ×
Empty, the dotted area in Fig. 10 (C2) show those of
Medium × Empty, and the dashed area in Fig. 10 (C3)
show those of Small × Empty.

Fig. 10 (A) shows that there is a high-density peak
in the area where users can perceive the virtual horizon
from each Empty condition from Study 1. In particu-
lar, this AoD peak is more pronounced in the Large
sizes, as shown in Fig. 10 (A1), consistent with the sta-
tistical results for AoD medians that the subjects look
downward while they are walking in a larger room.
Furthermore, Fig. 10 (A1) shows that the existence of
virtual objects biases the AoD distribution to be lower
in Large conditions. In the Medium and Small virtual
room, the Furnished condition also has a peak at higher
AoD compared to the Empty one as shown in Fig. 10
(A2),(A3).

In order to more quantitatively analyze user gaze
information, the Aligned Rank Transform (ART) for
the non-parametric factorial ANOVA method (α =
0.05) was adapted to handle the multivariate analysis,
and all post hoc contrast comparisons were Bonfer-
roni corrected. In Study 1, we investigated user’s AoD
values within the within-subject factor of Size and
the between-subject factor of Object: The results only
showed a signiﬁcant main effect of Size (F(2, 70) =
4.832, p < .011). During the post hoc analysis, we
found signiﬁcant differences in pairs between Large
and Medium (p = .018), and Large and Small (p =
.043), but the pair of Medium and Small showed no sig-
niﬁcant difference (p > .05). The other factor Object
nor main interaction showed no signiﬁcant effects
(Object: F(1, 70) = 1.339, p = .251; Size×Object:
F(2, 70) = .172, p = .842). The AoD distribution
graph and statistical results conﬁrmed that participants
frequently notice the virtual horizon in Empty condi-
tions, and they look more downward in a larger-sized
condition than in a smaller one. On the other hand, the
presence of objects distributes users’ attention, which
weakens the relationship between AoD distribution and
the room size in the Furnished conditions.

The AoD distribution graph from Study 2 showed
that the percentage of horizon-noticeable gaze area,
which is determined by the size of the virtual space,
has no distinguishable peak in corresponding size con-
ditions. They were not much different from the density
distribution of horizon-noticeable gaze area in the
Large × Empty condition. These AoD results from
Large conditions imply that an inner ﬂoor area with
different tiles functions as a distractor, distributing the
user’s gaze to reach the virtual horizon conﬁgured by
the wall and the ﬂoor. As the size of the inner ﬂoor area
is the same as the Small room, the user’s AoD distri-
bution is expected to be high between −20◦ to −30◦
when they attract the subjects’ attention. As shown in

every Large condition from Fig. 10, we could observe
the peak in the AoD value between −20◦ to −30◦. On
the other hand, in Small size conditions, we could ﬁnd
the AoD peak near the AoD value between 0◦ to −10◦.
As in Study 1, the ART for non-parametric factorial
ANOVA analysis (α = 0.05) was used to conduct the
multivariate analysis within the within-subject factor
of Layout, the between-subject factor of Size, and the
factor of AoD Median. We also found signiﬁcant main
effect of Size (F(1, 98) = 65.109, p < .001), but no
main effect of Layout (F(3, 98) = .115, p = .951) nor
Size×Layout interaction effect were found (F(3, 98) =
.525, p = .666). Therefore, it was revealed that the
user’s AoD values in Large and Small room size was
signiﬁcantly different (p < .001). This indicates that
subjects in the small virtual room were more likely
to face the front wall while walking along the path.
Moreover, Fig. 10 (B) shows the AoD peak in the Large
size condition was presented between −20◦ to −30◦,
which implies the boundary of an inner ﬂoor draws
attention from subjects.

4.3.2 Gaze Heatmap

We utilized the gaze heatmap to observe the effect of
spatial layout on the user’s distribution of attention.
We normalized the individual gaze information of the
subjects for each condition and accumulated every sub-
ject’s gaze data from the same experiment condition.
While subjects walked the same path during the exper-
iment, most of them gazed at the end of the direction
in which they walked. In the four layout conditions of
the Small room, the average gaze proportion reaching
the wall was 76.08% (STD = 4.18). In the Large size
conditions, the average gaze proportion to the wall, the

outer ﬂoor area, and the other ﬂoor areas, excluding
the inner tiled ﬂoor, was 45.52% (STD = 4.5). Fig. 11
is the gaze heatmap in the eight spatial conﬁgurations
using the gaze data of Study 2. Since the purpose of the
gaze heatmap is to observe the user’s gaze distribution
changes by spatial layout, only the gaze data within the
inner area 5cm away from each side of the inner ﬂoor
was used.

Fig. 11 shows that the gaze heatmaps from the same
spatial layout share a similar pattern regardless of the
size. Results show that participants frequently focused
their gaze on their walking paths. According to the
spatial layout, the gaze distributions in the following
pairs were similar: Empty and Peripheral, Centered
and Scattered. In the Empty and Peripheral layouts,
participants mostly gazed at the paths they walked on.
In addition, the Peripheral condition’s gaze heatmap
showed that the object located at the left top corner,
which is less relevant to the path, rarely played a role
in attracting the user’s attention. In the Centered and
Scattered layouts, on the other hand, subjects viewed
not only the path but also the objects inside the path. In
the Centered layout, the ratio of subjects looking at the
objects inside the path is more signiﬁcant. From the
gaze heatmap of the Scattered layouts, two object clus-
ters inside the path were frequently gazed and also two
objects outside the path were gazed at by the subjects.
In conclusion, we veriﬁed that the subjects frequently
perceived objects placed in the Centered and Scattered
conditions through a gaze heatmap.

4.4 Post VR Sickness Comparison

effect of RTG on users’ VR simulator sickness (Kim
et al., 2022). Results show there was no signiﬁcant dif-
ference in the mean post-SSQ TS scores for Large ×
Empty (with RTGs) and Large × Empty (no RTGs),
nor between the Large × Furnished (with RTGs) and
the Large × Furnished (no RTGs). Through statisti-
cal results from Study 1, we conﬁrmed that relative
translation gains are not a signiﬁcant factor in VR sim-
ulator sickness. In Study 2, we compared post-SSQ
TS from each condition to compare the effect of spa-
tial layout on the VR simulator sickness. The ART
for non-parametric factorial ANOVA analysis was also
used to handle multifactor analysis. Results show all
factors and their interaction effect showed no signiﬁ-
cant main effects (Size: F(1, 105) = 1.072, p = .303;
Layout: F(3, 105) = .711, p = .548; Size × Layout:
F(3, 105) = .132, p = .941). We could conﬁrm there
was no signiﬁcant effect of spatial layout on the VR
simulator sickness.

5 Discussion

5.1 Analysis

We evaluate our three hypotheses for the study based
on results from Section 4. Our ﬁrst hypothesis about the
impact of size on the RTG threshold was supported in
Study 1, as there was a signiﬁcant difference between
the Large size condition and the Medium, Small one.
However, our hypothesis about the impact of size on

the RTG threshold was not supported, as there was
no signiﬁcant difference was found between the Large
size condition and the Small one in Study 2. Different
results from the two studies for size seem to be related
to the number of conditions with distractors among the
conditions experienced by the subjects. In Study 1, the
Empty space without any distractors accounted for half
of the experimental conditions. On the other hand, for
Study 2, the proportion of the Empty room was only
25%, and the inner ﬂoor was expressed with bright
tiles, which distribute the user’s attention as shown
in Fig. 11. Based on these statistical results and gaze
distributions from two studies, we conﬁrmed that the
effect of size in the Empty room without distractors
was signiﬁcant: When the space is empty, the cognitive
threshold increases to a greater degree when its size is
more extensive. However, the effect of the size of the
space is relatively small in conditions where distractors
exist.

Fig. 10 (A) shows that subjects from Study 1 often
looked at the virtual horizon in the Empty condition
regardless of the room size. However, subjects did not
perceived virtual horizon frequently in the Furnished
conditions, so the impact of size is relatively small.
Furthermore, Fig. 10 (B) also shows that users from
Study 2 did not perceive the virtual horizon frequently
in every condition. This supports that the RTG thresh-
old was affected by the size of the virtual room only if
it’s empty and the virtual horizon is well noticeable to

subjects. However, in the case of a virtual room with
distractors, the effect of room size on the RTG thresh-
old range is less pronounced because the objects in the
VR room attract users’ attention.

Next, we veriﬁed the effect of the spatial layout on
the RTG threshold range. The second hypothesis about
the impact of spatial layout on the RTG threshold was
partially accepted. The statistical results from Study 2
conﬁrmed that the probability of “faster” responses in
the Scattered layout is signiﬁcantly lower than in the
Centered layout. In addition, in the interaction effect
analysis, we conﬁrmed that the probability of “faster”
responses in the Large × Scattered condition was sig-
niﬁcantly lower than in the Small × Centered condition.
Moreover, the probability of “faster” responses in the
Large × Peripheral condition was lower than in the
Small × Empty condition. Summarizing these statisti-
cal results and estimated RTG threshold ranges from
Table 3 and Table 4, we conclude that subjects become
less sensitive to an increase in their walking speed
in the following order of layout conditions: Scattered,
Peripheral, Empty, and Centered.

Fig. 11 shows that subjects looked more at the area
around the object under the Centered and Scattered
conditions than the Empty and Peripheral conditions.
Moreover, subjects gazed at the object more in the
Centered layout than in the Scattered layout. In the
post-experimental interview, many subjects said that
in the Centered condition, they estimated their walk-
ing speed by referring to the speed at which objects in
the space approached them. This indicates that users’
regarded objects differently according to the spatial
layout. Users were less sensitive to being faster when
objects distract their gaze, but in the Centered layout,
they utilize objects as a guide to help them notice their
speed to be faster. For instance, when objects are placed
at the center and gathered as a single cluster, subjects
are more aware of being faster in the virtual space
by using objects as reference targets to estimate their
speed. On the other hand, when objects are placed scat-
tered and come in and out of human’s sight repeatedly,
objects act as distractors and make users less sensitive
to be faster.

Our last hypothesis, which postulated that the AoD
distribution would be lower in the small-sized con-
ditions than in larger ones, was rejected for Study 1
and Study 2. The statistical results from Study 1 show
that the AoD medians from the Large conditions were
signiﬁcantly lower than those of Medium and Small
conditions. Likewise, in Study 2, the AoD medians in
Large conditions were signiﬁcantly lower than those in

Small conditions. These results are reﬂected in Fig. 10,
which shows that in every Large-sized condition, sub-
jects most frequently gazed at the area that fell between
the AoD values from −30◦ to −20◦, where the inner
ﬂoor’s boundary exists. In every Small-sized condi-
tion, however, the area subjects gazed at most often
was between −10◦ to 0◦ of their AoD, meaning that
they tended to look at the walls mostly while they were
walking.

Fig. 10 conﬁrms that the relationship between
AoD and the virtual horizon is well revealed only in
Empty conditions. This means that when objects exist
in a virtual space, AoD distribution is less relevant
in determining the value of RTG thresholds. This is
because even though the main reason for measuring
AoD is to determine how often users perceive a virtual
horizon, the existence of distractors distributes users’
gaze and makes it challenging to ﬁnd the relationship
between the virtual horizon and the RTG threshold
range. Rather, it is more effective to utilize the gaze
heatmap for analyzing the entire space in conditions
with distractors, as they could show how much each
object attracts the user’s gaze, as shown in Fig. 11.

5.2 Virtual Space Rescaling Guidelines
with Relative Translation Gains

Based on Section 5.1, we propose virtual space
rescaling guidelines with Relative Translation Gains
(RTGs) for system developers to increase the range of
adjustable movable space with RTG as follows.

1) Increase the adjustable movable space by

placing distractors in the virtual room.

Both study results show that the existence of dis-
tractors in the virtual room should be considered ﬁrst in
adjusting the virtual space through RTGs. We observed
that the RTG threshold range is greater in the Small ×
Furnished condition than in the Large × Empty from
Study 1 in Table 3. This indicates that when objects are
placed in a small virtual space and function as distrac-
tors, users will be less sensitive to increases in walking
speed compared to a larger and empty virtual room.
Moreover, the estimated RTG threshold range of Empty
conditions in Study 2 was relatively higher than that of
Study 1. This is because the ﬂoor tiles used in Study 2
to distinguish the inner ﬂoor area distracted the users.
This means that the existence of a distractor in the vir-
tual scene can create a virtual space that is larger than
the users’ actual movable space. In this study, we could
ﬁnd the virtual room with distractor conditions such as
placing objects densely, placing objects as a scattered

16

layout if it is not dense, or displaying a movable inner
ﬂoor with bright tiles. A simple way for developers
to increase the user’s explorable area with distractors
would be to visualize spatial boundaries with different
colors or patterns on the ﬂoor.

2) For empty spaces, set the perceived movable
space to be larger than the adjusted movable space:
The size of the virtual room is essential for an
empty virtual room. Users are less sensitive to being
faster in the virtual room with a higher virtual hori-
zon when they can recognize the horizon well while
walking. They could recognize the virtual horizon well
in an empty virtual room, so the threshold range of
RTG shifted toward the size of the virtual room. From
the perspective of space rescaling, we could increase a
tracked space more when we ﬁt it to the larger target
virtual space. On the other hand, we could decrease
the tracked space more when we rescaled it for match-
ing to the smaller target virtual space. As the goal of
applying RTGs to RDW is to maximize the aligned
area between the virtual space and the real space, con-
sidering the effect of room size on RTG thresholds is
helpful to rescale and sync the tracked real space to the
target virtual space. When developers generate a new
empty virtual space, the space expansion effect can be
maximized if the perceivable movable space is larger
than the adjusted movable space.

3) Avoid placing objects where they are con-

stantly in a user’s sight:

Study 2 revealed that the role of objects in a VR
space differs according to the spatial layout they con-
ﬁgured. When objects are scattered in the virtual room,
they function as distractors and increase the adjustable
movable space when RTGs are applied. On the other
hand, when objects gather to form a single cluster,
they act as aids that help users estimate their walk-
ing speed, thereby increasing the movable space. Our
results show that the virtual movable space can be
expanded with RTGs in the following order: Centered,
Empty, Peripheral, and Scattered. In the case of Scat-
tered and Peripheral layouts, objects frequently enter
and exit the users’ ﬁeld of view while they are walking
and constantly distract their attention from their walk-
ing speed. In the Centered layout, however, users can
consistently perceive and predict their location regard-
less of their position and direction along the walking
path. Their ﬁxed presence in sight, along with the users’
perception of how fast they approach or move away
from them, help users estimate their walking speed.
Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish the spatial lay-
out of virtual space and ﬁgure out the role of objects to

adaptively set the RTG threshold range and rescale the
virtual space.

5.3 Limitations

There are some limitations in this work that should be
addressed in the future. The ﬁrst limitation is that the
studies were only conducted in a static environment.
In various locomotion-based VR applications, virtual
objects and information frequently move around or pop
up in the air. As this study conﬁrmed that distractors
in ﬁxed positions in virtual space signiﬁcantly inﬂu-
ence the RTG threshold range, further investigation on
whether dynamic objects or information also function
as distractors in speciﬁc situations and how they affect
the RTG threshold range should be conducted.

Second, we should conduct a user study with the
virtual space rescaled with RTGs. As RTGs were pro-
posed to transform the virtual space while maintaining
a coordinate system between physical and virtual space,
we should investigate the user experience in rescaled
virtual space. Furthermore, to determine whether apply-
ing RTGs to RDW is beneﬁcial for real-world scenarios
in merging physical spaces with the target virtual space,
we should compare the rescaled space based on RTGs
with spaces generated from previous RDW methods.
Lastly, our study is limited to a situation where
only one user occupies a virtual space. When a user
co-exists with game characters or remote users in VR,
various modes of interaction with them can inﬂuence
the user’s visual perception and recognition of changes
in their walking speed. As users’ gaze distribution in
VR will be affected by how other users behave in the
same space, factoring in the presence of others should
be a needed step in expanding the scope of our current
work. In particular, further studies are needed in multi-
user remote collaboration scenarios where users from
heterogeneous spaces gather together and communicate
with each other in the mutual space.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this study, we analyzed how spatial conﬁgurations of
the virtual space affect the Relative Translation Gains
(RTGs) threshold range and derived guidelines on how
the virtual space can be adaptively rescaled with RTG-
based RDW. To verify the inﬂuence on the user’s visual
perception according to the composition of the virtual
space, we utilized the distribution of AoDs and gaze
heatmaps generated from the user’s gaze data. Our
results show that the three components of the virtual

Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template

space–size, the existence of the objects, and the spatial
layout–have a signiﬁcant effect on the RTG threshold.
The adjustable movable space can be increased further
when distractors exist in the virtual room. Moreover,
the adjustable movable space can be expanded when
the perceived movable space is larger than the actual
movable space in empty VR environments. Lastly, the
adjustable movable space increases in a scattered layout
where objects function as distractors, but it decreases
in a centered layout where objects function as guides
by which users can estimate their walking speed.

When applying translation gain-based RDW,
proper threshold values must be set to avoid VR
simulator sickness. Using the virtual space rescal-
ing guidelines derived from our results, developers
can determine proper RTG threshold ranges accord-
ing to the conﬁguration of the target virtual space.
Our proposed translation gain-based spatial deforma-
tion method can synchronize the target virtual space
with the tracked physical space while maximizing the
movable area for the user. More speciﬁcally, this can
be achieved by precisely matching the boundaries of
physical objects to virtual ones through RTG-based
deformation, which can unify the coordinate system of
the two spaces.

Our future work will explore the effect of dynamic
objects and information on the RTG threshold range. In
addition, we will determine the performance of RTG-
based rescaling methods with 3D indoor scene data
sets obtained from tools such as Matterport 3D (Chang
et al., 2017) and compare the generated explorable vir-
tual space results with previous methods (Keshavarzi
et al., 2020, 2022, Lehment et al., 2014). We will
also experiment with a scenario where multiple VR
clients’ avatars move around in the same target VR
space according to their adaptive RTG values. Ulti-
mately, we aim to develop and apply RTG-based RDW
to generate a mutual collaborative space for Extended
Reality (XR) that aligns heterogeneous physical spaces
to a single VR space with a uniﬁed coordinate system.
