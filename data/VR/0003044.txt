SUMMARY

 and VirSWm

1/2, modulated by C  W pulsation

The coherent physical theory of Psi phenomena, like remote vision, telepathy, telekinesis,
remote healing, clairvoyance - is absent till now due to its high complexity and multilateral
character.
The mechanism of Bivacuum mediated Psi - phenomena is proposed in this work. It is based
on many stages of my long term efforts, including creation of few new theories:
1) Unified theory of Bivacuum, rest mass and charge origination, fusion of elementary
particles (electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, etc.) from certain number of sub-elementary
fermions and dynamic mechanism of their corpuscle-wave [C - W] duality
(http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207027);
2) Quantitative Hierarchic theory of liquids and solids, verified on examples of water and ice
by special, theory based, computer program (http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0102086);
3) Hierarchic model of consciousness: from mesoscopic Bose condensation (mBC) to
synaptic reorganization (http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0003045);
4) Theory of primary Virtual Replica (VR) of material objects in Bivacuum and VR
Multiplication: VRM (r,t). The VR represents a three-dimensional (3D) superposition of
Bivacuum virtual standing waves VPWm
of elementary particles and translational and librational de Broglie waves of molecules of
macroscopic object (http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207027). The infinitive multiplication of
primary VR in space in form of 3D packets of virtual standing waves: VRM(r), is a result
of interference of all pervading external coherent basic reference waves - Bivacuum Virtual
Pressure Waves (VPWq1
) and Virtual Spin Waves (VirSWq1
forming primary VR. This phenomena may stand for remote vision of psychic. The ability
of enough complex system of VRM(t) to self-organization in nonequilibrium conditions,
make it possible multiplication of VR not only in space but as well, in time in both time
direction - positive (evolution) and negative (devolution). The feedback reaction between
most probable/stable VRM(t) and nerve system of psychic, including visual centers of brain,
can by responsible for clairvoyance;
5) Theory of nonlocal Virtual Guides (VirGSME) of spin, momentum and energy,
representing virtual microtubules with properties of quasi one-dimensional virtual Bose
condensate, constructed from ’head-to-tail’ polymerized Bivacuum bosons (BVB) or
Cooper pairs of Bivacuum fermions (BVF). The bundles of VirGSME, connecting coherent
atoms of Sender (S) and Receiver (S), as well as nonlocal component of VRM(r,t),
determined by interference pattern of Virtual Spin Waves, are responsible for nonlocal weak
interaction, telekinesis, telepathy and remote healing;
6) Theory of Bivacuum Mediated Interaction (BMI as a new fundamental interaction due to
superposition of Virtual replicas of Sender and Receiver, because of VRM(r,t) mechanism,
and connection of their coherent atoms via VirGSME bundles. Just BMI is responsible for
remote ultraweak nonlocal interaction and different psi-phenomena. The system: [S  R]
should be in nonequilibrium state.

The correctness of our approach follows from its ability to explain a lot of unconventional
experimental data, like Kozyrev ones, remote genetic transmutation, remote vision,
mind-matter interaction, etc. without contradictions with fundamental laws of nature. For

1. Introduction

The Dirac’s equation points to equal probability of positive and negative energy (Dirac,

1947). In asymmetric Dirac’s vacuum its realm of negative energy is saturated with
infinitive number of electrons. However, it was assumed that these electrons, following
Pauli principle, have not any gravitational or viscosity effects. Positrons and electron in his
model represent the ’holes’, originated as a result of the electrons jumps in realm of
positive energy over the energetic gap:   2m0c2. Currently it becomes clear, that the
Dirac type model of vacuum is not general enough to explain all known experimental data,
for example, the bosons emergency. The model of Bivacuum, presented in this paper and in
other works (Kaivarainen, 1995; 2000; 2004; 2005a,b:
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207027) looks to be more advanced. However, it use the same
starting point of equal probability of positive and negative energy, confined in each of
Bivacuum cell-dipole in the absence of these dipoles symmetry shift.

Aspden (2003) introduced in his aether theory the basic unit, named Quon, as a pair of

virtual muons of opposite charges, i.e. [muon  antimuon]. This idea has some common
with our model of Bivacuum dipoles of torus  antitorus of opposite energy/mass, charge
and magnetic moments with Compton radiuses, corresponding to electron, muon and tauon
(Kaivarainen, 2004, 2005).

The superfluid model of vacuum, composed from pairs of fermions of opposite spins

and charge where discussed earlier by Sinha et. al., (1976; 1976a; 1978) and also by
Boldyreva and Sotina (1999).

In 1957 Bohm published a book: Causality and Chance in Modern Physics. Later he
comes to conclusion, that Universe has a properties of giant, flowing hologram. Taking into
account its dynamic nature, he prefer to use term: holomovement. In his book: Wholeness
and the Implicate Order (1980) he develops an idea that our explicated unfolded reality is a
product of enfolded (implicated) or hidden order of existence. He consider the
manifestation of all forms in the universe, as a result of enfolding and unfolding exchange
between two orders, determined by super quantum potential.

In book, written by D. Bohm and B. Hiley (1993): ”THE UNDIVIDED UNIVERSE.
An ontological interpretation of quantum theory” the electron is considered, as a particle
with well- defined position and momentum which are, however, under influence of special
wave (quantum potential). Elementary particle, in accordance with these authors, is a
sequence of incoming and outgoing waves, which are very close to each other. However,
particle itself does not have a wave nature. Interference pattern in double slit experiment
after Bohm is a result of periodically ”bunched” character of quantum potential.

After Bohm, the manifestation of corpuscle - wave duality of particle is dependent on
the way, which observer interacts with a system. He claims that both of this properties are
always enfolded in particle. It is a basic difference with our model of duality, assuming that
the wave and corpuscle phase are realized alternatively with high frequency during two
different semiperiods of sub-elementary particles, forming particles in the process of
quantum beats between sublevels of positive (actual) and negative (complementary) energy.
This frequency is amplitude and phase modulated by experimentally revealed de Broglie
wave of particles. The important point of Bohmian philosophy, coinciding with our
concept, is that everything in the Universe is a part of dynamic continuum.
Neurophysiologist Karl Pribram does made the next step in the same direction as Bohm:
”The brain is a hologram enfolded in a holographic Universe”.

Sidharth (1998, 1999) considered elementary particle as a relativistic vortex of
Compton radius, from which he recovered its mass and quantized spin. He pictured a
particle as a fluid vortex steadily circulating with light velocity along a 2D ring or spherical
3D shell with radius

7

L 

    1

Inside such vortex the notions of negative energy, superluminal velocities and nonlocality
are acceptable without contradiction with conventional theory.

He treated also a charged Dirac fermions, as a Kerr-Newman black holes. Within the
region of Compton vortex the superluminal velocity and negative energy are possible after
Sidharth. If measurements are averaged over time t ~ mc2/ and over space L ~ /mc, the
imaginary part of particle’s position disappears and we are back in usual Physics (Sidharth,
1998).

2. New Hierarchical Model of Bivacuum, as a Superfluid Multi-Dipole Structure

2.1. Properties of Bivacuum dipoles - Bivacuum fermions and Bivacuum bosons

New concept of Bivacuum is elaborated, as a dynamic superfluid matrix of the Universe

with large domains of virtual Bose condensation, standing for their nonlocal properties.
Bivacuum is represented by continuum of subquantum particles and antiparticles of the
opposite energies, with properties of quantum liquids, separated by energy gap. The
collective excitations of such quantum liquid, form the quantized vortical structures in
Bivacuum - strongly interrelated donuts: toruses V and antitoruses V of the opposite
energies with Compton radiuses L0
pairs of these in-phase clockwise or anticlockwise rotating toruses and antitoruses
(cell-dipoles), form Bivacuum fermions (BVF  V V)i and antifermions
(BVF  V V)i of opposite spins. The intermediate state between Bivacuum fermions
of opposite spins, named Bivacuum bosons, has two possible polarization:
(BVB  V V)i and (BVB  V V)i. Two Bivacuum fermions of opposite spins
may form Cooper pair: [BVF  BVF. The correlated actual torus (V and
complementary antitorus (V have the opposite quantized energy, mass, charges and
magnetic moments, which compensate each other in symmetric primordial Bivacuum (in
the absence of matter and fields) and do not compensate in secondary Bivacuum.

considered as ’drops’ of virtual Bose condensation of subquantum particles of positive and

virtual pressure waves totally compensate each other: VPWq

In accordance with our model of Bivacuum, virtual particles and antiparticles represent

the asymmetric Bivacuum dipoles BVFas and BVBas of three electron generations
(i  e, ,  in unstable state, not corresponding to Golden mean conditions. Virtual
particles and antiparticles are the result of correlated and opposite Bivacuum dipole
symmetry fluctuations. Virtual particles, like the real sub-elementary particles, may exist in
Corpuscular and Wave phases. The Corpuscular [C]- phase, represents the correlated pairs
of asymmetric torus (V and antitorus (V of two different by absolute values energies.
The Wave [W]- phase, results from quantum beats between these states, which are
accompanied by emission or absorption of Cumulative Virtual Clouds (CVC or CVC,
formed by subquantum particles.

Virtual particles have a mass, charge, spin, etc., but they differs from real

sub-elementary ones by their lower stability (short life-time) and inability for fusion to
stable triplets. They are a singlets or very unstable triplets or other clusters of Bivacuum
dipoles (BVF)as in contrast to real stable fermions-triplets or bosons, containing the
integer number of sub-elementary fermion and antifermion pairs.

For Virtual Clouds (VC and virtual pressure waves (VPW excited by them, the
relativistic mechanics is not valid. Consequently, the causality principle also does not work
in a system (interference pattern) of VPW.

3. Three conservation rules for Bivacuum fermions (BVFas and
Bivacuum bosons (BVBas
There are three basic postulates/rules in our theory, interrelated with each other:
I. The absolute values of internal rotational kinetic energies of torus and antitorus are
equal to each other and to the half of the rest mass energy of the electrons of corresponding
lepton generation, independently on the external group velocity (v, turning the symmetric
Bivacuum fermions (BVF to asymmetric ones:

As is shown in the next section, just these conditions provide the same charge symmetry

It follows from second postulate, that the resulting magnetic moment of sub-elementary

fermion or antifermion (, equal to the Bohr’s magneton, is interrelated with the actual
spin of Bivacuum fermion or antifermion as:

Consequently, the permanent absolute value of spin of torus and antitorus is a

and the notions of actual and complementary parameters change place. Corresponding
symmetry shifts between torus and antitorus in secondary Bivacuum take a place in
presence of matter and fields. The product of actual (inertial) and complementary

If we proceed from the assumption that the total energy of the corpuscular and wave

where: C is a permanent complex number. The module of the wave function squared
||2    const is independent on x. This means that the probability to find a particle
with permanent p is equal in any space volume (or it can be localized everywhere). This
contradicts the experimental data.

The Quantum Mechanics solve this contradiction assuming the idea of Shrödinger, that

particle represents the ’wave packet’ with big number of de Broglie waves with different
p  k, localized in a small interval p. The amplitude of all this number of de Broglie
waves in the packet with spatial dimension x  B add to each other because of close
phase. For the other hand, at the x  B they damper out each other because of phase
difference.

The wave packet model can be explained, using eq.6.4 for nonrelativistic particles:
v  c and R  1  v/c2 ~ 1. For this case, the carrying internal frequency of C  W
pulsation is much higher, than the external translational de Broglie wave modulation

frequency: 0
waves, generated by the internal C  Win dynamics, corresponding to zitterbewegung
(Shrödinger, 1930). However, the wave packet concept itself do not explain the mechanism
of C  W duality.

Our dynamic corpuscle - wave C  W duality theory suggests another possible

explanation of the uncertainty principle realization, as a counterphase pulsation of

23

momentum and position, energy and time, described above. The C  W transition is
accompanied by conversion of real mass to virtual one, presented by cumulative virtual
cloud CVC. As far the energies of both phase C and W are equal, it makes possible to
apply the relativistic mechanics to both of them.

Such a structure can originate also, as a result of excitation and fusion of three pairs of

There are two possible ways to make the rotation of adjacent sub-elementary fermion
and sub-elementary antifermion compatible. One of them is interaction ’side-by-side’, like
in the 1st and 3d pairs of (6.12). In such a case of Cooper pairs, they are rotating in
opposite directions and their angular momenta (spins) compensate each other, turning the
resulting spin of such a pair to zero. The resulting energy and charge of such a pair of
sub-elementary particle and antiparticle is also zero, because their symmetry shifts with
respect to Bivacuum is exactly opposite, compensating each other.

The other way of compatibility is interaction ’head-to-tail’, like in a central pair of
sub-elementary fermions of 7.11a. In this configuration they rotate in the same direction
and the sum of their spins is: s  1. The energy of this pair is a sum of the absolute
values of the energies of sub-elementary fermion and antifermion, as far their resulting
symmetry shift is a sum of the symmetry shifts of each of them.

The energy of photon in Corpuscular phase is a sum of energy of tori of asymmetric

sub-elementary fermion and antifermion. Equal to this energy, the energy of the Wave

However, the general expression of density of probability (6.36) of particle location in

We can see, that the general expression of density probability of particle in [C] phase

presented in Fig.1 and Fig.3. At fixed coordinate (x), the probability of particle in [C]

probability is dependent on coordinate of particle in [C] phase location.

The jumps of the triplets (fermions) or sextet (photons) with group velocity of wave

violation of energy conservation and energy dissipation.

The most probable distance of such ’jump’ is determined by de Broglie wave length of

particle (B  h/p, equal to that of cumulative virtual cloud of uncompensated
sub-elementary fermions and the most probable direction of jump coincide with particle
momentum in its [C] phase. However the new location of particle, as only one of many
possible, is not predetermined and ’jumps’ can be considered as the stochastic process.

The principle of superposition in quantum mechanics has the same formal shape as in

classical mechanics:

where: cn are arbitrary complex numbers; r, tn is wave function, describing different

n states of quantum system. In accordance to our theory these states correspond to
possible anchor sites of moving in space particle.

However, in contrast to state/wave superposition of classical systems, in quantum
system any state is not the result of ’mixing’ of other states, but always the alternative or
orthogonal, i.e. only one state of many possible.

The time for each selected closed system of particles is a parameter, characterizing the

means the infinitive life-time of torus and antitorus of our Bivacuum dipoles, following
from 1st postulate of Unified theory (see eq. 3.1). The pace of time and time itself are

virtual elastic waves, excited by the opposite charges, is followed by linear alignment of
Bivacuum dipoles between them and their mass and charge symmetry shift. This effects
provide the Coulomb attraction between opposite charges due to decreasing of resulting
symmetry shift between charges. The Coulomb repulsion is also result of system tendency
to reduce the resulting symmetry shift of Bivacuum in space between similar by sign
charges.

For free elementary particles the notion of secondary virtual replica, as one of

8.2 The superposition of internal and surface Virtual Replicas of the object,
as the ”Ether Body"

VirSWq1
describing its internal bulk properties. The overall shape of (VRin should be close to shape
of the object itself, for example, such as the human’s body and it organs shape.

and



Spatial stability of condensed systems means that the macroscopic internal virtual

replica: VRin   VRmic

in , as a result of 3D standing waves superposition of microscopic

36

in superfluid Bivacuum, should have location of nodes, coinciding with the most

in
VRmic
probable positions of the atoms and molecules in condensed matter.

The superposition of coherent de Broglie waves of atoms and molecules in clusters,
forming3D standing waves B, determined by their librations and translations, represents the
mesoscopic Bose condensate: [mBC (Kaivarainen, 2001 b,c). In accordance to our theory,
this means also the coherent [C  W pulsations of elementary particles of these molecules
and atoms. The violation of this coherency is accompanied by density fluctuation and
defects origination or cavitational fluctuations in solids and liquids.

The surface macroscopic virtual replica of the object: VRsur   VRmic

sur is a part of the

Ether body. The mechanism of its origination is similar to internal macroscopic virtual
replica of the object VRin   VRmic
in . It is a result of modulation of Bivacuum virtual
waves by de Broglie waves of elementary particles of the atoms and molecules on the
surface of the object. Its dimension can exceed the dimensions of the object.

The superposition of the internal and surface virtual replicas corresponds to notion of

the ”ether body” in Eastern philosophy:

    8.11

Stability of hierarchic system of whirls, forming Ether Body, as a hierarchical system of

virtual standing waves and curls in superfluid Bivacuum (like permanent circular currents
and whirls in superfluid 4He), could be responsible for so-called ”phantom effect” of this
object.

8.3 The infinitive spatial Virtual Replica Multiplication VPM(r).
The ”Astral” and ”Mental” bodies, as a distant and nonlocal components of VRM(r)

The mechanism of primary Virtual Replica Multiplication VPM) have general features
with hologram origination, however without photomaterials or screens, fixing VR. The role
of coherent reference waves play unperturbed by the object basic Bivacuum virtual waves
(VPWq1
primary Virtual Replica of the object, containing information not only on shape/surface, but
also about internal properties of the subject.

1/2. The role of subject waves is represented by the

and nonlocal VirSWq1



The VRM is a spatially isotropic process, like excitation of spherical waves. It can be

subdivided on two components - distant (translational) and nonlocal (rotational or
librational):

1) the distant component of VRM(r)dis is a result of replication of the translational
component of primary VR outside the volume of the object, by means of Virtual Pressure
Waves (VPWq1
isotropicaly expand in space like gravitation waves with light velocity
(http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207027).

 . The front of 3D VRMdis in form of huge number of secondary VR

The virtual replica of the object can be reproducible in form of distant VRMdis (like the

hologram) in any remote space regions, where the interference pattern of the reference
 with primary VR as the object wave, is existing. The volume of space,
wave VPWq1
occupied by distant VRMdis, is expanding with light velocity (c) during the life-time of
primary VR and atoms, composing the object.

The expanding with light velocity population of VRct, spatially separated from the

body/object, may correspond to Eastern ancient notion of the ”astral body”:

t

Astral Body 

 VRtrct  VRMdis

    8.12

37

As far each individual secondary VR in population

t
 VRct in the absence of

dissipation in superfluid Bivacuum is the exact copy of the primary VR, they should be
spatially also indistinguishable, like particles in state of Bose condensate. The detected by
psychic or by special device secondary replica displays its properties

The dielectric permittivity (0 and permeability (0 in the volume of the Astral bodies
may differ from their averaged values in Bivacuum because of small charge symmetry shift
in Bivacuum fermions (BVF): e  |e  e |  0, induced by recoil  antirecoil effects,
accompanied C  W pulsation of elementary particles. Consequently, the probability of
atoms and molecules excitation and ionization (dependent on Coulomb interaction between
electrons and nuclears), as a result of their thermal collisions with excessive kinetic energy,
may be higher in volumes of the Astral bodies, than outside of them. This may explain their
special optical effects - a shining of some objects phantoms (ghosts) in darkness, or their
specific spectrogram, representing astral bodies. Their spatial instability of phantoms can
be explained by spatial similarity of astral bodies, composing VRMdis. The possibility of
phenomena like remote vision and remote healing also follow from our holomovement like
mechanism of VRMrS  VRMrR superposition of Sender and Receiver and their
’tuning’.

The sensitivity of Kirlian effect or Gas Discharge Visualization (GDV) to internal

process of macroscopic object, like human body, also can be explained by specific
properties of the surface Ether and Astral bodies, changing the probability of the air
molecules excitation/ionization after thermal collision;

2) the nonlocal component of VRMnl is a result of 3D replication of the

rotational/librational component of primary virtual replica (VRlb outside the volume of the
 , propagating
object, by means of nonlocal (informational) Virtual Spin Waves (VirSWq1
in symmetric Bivacuum instantly, i.e. without light velocity limitation.

The nonlocal macroscopic virtual replica multiplication (VRMnl) or VR iteration, is a
result of interference of modulated by librational de Broglie waves the recoil  antirecoil
effects the Bivacuum virtual spin waves: VirSWm
corresponding reference spin waves of Bivacuum (VirSWq

1/2  object spin waves with

1/2.

The Eastern notion of mental body may correspond to VRMnl, as a multiplication
(holoiteration or holomovement after Bohm) of informational Virtual Replicas VRlb :

Mental Body 

 VRlb  VRMnl

t

    8.13

Hierarchical superposition of huge number of Astral and Mental Bodies of all human
population on the Earth can be responsible for Global Informational Field origination, like
Noosphere, proposed by Russian scientist Vernadsky in the beginning of 20th century. The
Astral and Mental bodies may partly be overlapped with Ether body. This provide the
possibility of dynamic exchange interaction and feedback reaction between all three virtual
bodies of the object: Ether, Astral and Mental.

One important conjecture, following from our approach to distant VRMdis can be
discussed. We proceed from the consequence of our theory, that the volume of space,
occupied by distant VRMdis is expanding isotropicaly with light velocity (c) in 3D space
during the life-time of VR and atoms, composing the object.

The life span of the individual stable atoms, including hydrogen, carbons, oxygen,
composing biological objects is comparable with life-time of the Universe, i.e. over ten
billions of years. This means, that not only nonlocal VRMnl,, but as well the distant
VRMdis of these atoms may involve all the Universe. It is a conditions of Virtual Guides of
spin, momentum and energy (VirGSME 3D net formation in the Universe, connecting

38

virtually all similar and coherent elementary particles and atoms of the equal de Broglie
wave length. We suppose, however, that only in composition of biosystems these atoms
may become enough coherent and orchestrated to provide a strong enough cumulative
interaction between Sender and Receiver, for example, between psychic and very remote
objects (inorganic or biological) via 3D net of VirGSME and VRM as a factors of Bivacuum
mediated interaction (BMI). The construction of VirGSME and mechanism of their action
will be described in the next section.

A complex Hierarchical system VRM(r,t) of Solar system, galactics, including

Noosphere, may be considered as Hierarchical quantum supercomputer or
Superconsciousness, able to simulate all probable situations of virtual future and past. It is
possible in conditions of time uncertainty: t  0/0 when the translational velocity v  0
and accelerations dv/dt  0 in the volume of VRM(r,t) are zero (Kaivarainen, 2005:
http://arXiv.org/abs/physics/0103031 ).

Our theory admit a possibility of feedback reaction between the iterated VR and

primary one and between primary VR and the object physical properties. Consequently, the
phenomena of most probable event anticipation by enough sensitive physical detectors and
human beings (psychics) is possible in principle. This may explain the reproducible results
of unconsciousness response (by changes of human skin conductance) of future events
(presponse), obtained by Dick Bierman and Dean Radin (2002). However, in these
experiments the possibility of influence of intention of participant on random events
generator (REG), choosing next photo (calm or emotional), like in Bierman’s experiments,
also should be taken into account. Such kind of weak influence of humans intention on
REG was demonstrated in long term studies of Danne and Jahn (2003).

In contrast to virtual time, the reversibility of real time looks impossible, as far it needs

the reversibility of all dynamic process in Universe due to interrelations between closed
systems of different levels of hierarchy. It is evident that such ’play back’ of the Universe
history needs the immense amount of energy redistribution in the Universe.

All three described Virtual Replicas: Ether, Astral and Mental bodies are interrelated
with each other and physical body. The experimental evidences are existing, that between
properties of the Ether bodies and corresponding physical bodies of living organisms or
inorganic matter, the correlation takes a place. It is confirmed by the Kirlian effect,
reflecting the ionization/excitation threshold of the air molecules in volume of Ether and
astral bodies.

The perturbation of the Ether body of one object (Receptor) by the astral or mental

body of the other object (Sender) can be imprinted in properties of physical body
(condensed matter) of Receptor for a long time in form of subtle, but stable structural
perturbations. The stability of such kind of informational ’taping’ is determined by specific
properties of material, as a matrix for imprinting. For example, water and aqueous systems,
like biological ones, are very good for stable imprinting of virtual information and energy
via introduced VRM and Virtual Guides (see next chapter). However, some ’sensitive’
stones or other rigid materials have a much longer life span.

The Ghost phenomena can be explained by reproducing of such imprinted in walls,
cells and floor information, mediated by distant virtual replica multiplication (VRMdis). The
reproduction of VR from imprinted in condensed matter VRMdis is a process, similar to
treatment of regular hologram by the reference waves. In the case of ’Ghost’ the reference
1/2, modulated by special superposition
 and VirSWm
waves can be presented by basic VPWm
of Virtual replicas of other objects, for example, Earth, Moon and Sun.

The nonlocal Mental - Informational body formation in living organisms and humans,

in accordance to our theory (Kaivarainen, 2001; 2003), is related to equilibrium shift of
dynamic equilibrium of [assembly  disassembly] of coherent water clusters in

39

microtubules of the neurons (librational effectons), accompanied series of elementary acts
of consciousness in nonequilibrium processes of meditation, intention and braining.
Corresponding variations of kinetic energy and momentum of water molecules can be
transmitted from Sender to remote Receiver via nonlocal virtual spin-momentum-energy
guides (VirGSME), described in next chapter.

In complex process of Psi phenomena, the first stage is a ’target searching’ by nonlocal

[mental body] of psychic, then formation of VirGSME, then activation of psychic’s [astral
body] by its [ether body]. The latter can be interrelated with specific processes of physical
body of psychic, like dynamics of water in microtubules of neurons ensembles, realizing
elementary acts of perception and consciousness, in accordance to our model (Kaivarainen,
2000; 2005).

9 Possible Mechanism of Quantum entanglement between distant
elementary particles via Virtual Guides of spin, momentum and energy (VirGS,M,E

In accordance to our theory, the instant nonlocal quantum entanglement between two or

more distant similar elementary particles (electrons, protons, neutrons, photons), named
[Sender (S)] and [Receiver (R)], revealed in a lot of experiments, started by Aspect and
Grangier (1983), involves a few stages:

1. Superposition of the nonlocal components of Virtual replicas multiplication (VRM)

interacting identical particles (like electrons, protons) and their complexes in form of atoms
and molecules, as a condition of Virtual Guides of spin-momentum-energy (VirGSME
between [S] and [R] formation (see Fig.4).

The formation of two spatial configurations of Virtual Guides, representing quasi 1D

virtual Bose condensate (BC), is possible:

energy transmission from [S] to [R] of selected generation of elementary particles is
determined by the translational and librational velocity variation (v of nuclei of (S). This
means, that energy/momentum transition from [S] to [R] is possible, if they are in
nonequilibrium state.

The variation of kinetic energy of atomic nuclei under external force application,
induces nonequilibrium in a system S  R and decoherence of C  W pulsation of
protons and neutrons of [S] and [R]. The nonlocal energy transmission from [S] to [R] is

from [S] to [R]. The opposite nonequilibrium state of system, i.e. TS  TR provides the
opposite direction of energy/momentum flux - from [R] to [S].

The proposed mechanism of Pauli repulsion between fermions of the same spin state

(Kaivarainen http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0103031) also may play a role in repulsion
between Sender and Receiver.

The length of VirGSME, connecting elementary particles, can vary in the process of [S]

and [R] interaction because of fast self-assembly of Bivacuum dipoles into virtual
microtubules.

9.2 The mechanism of spin/information exchange between tuned particles
of Sender and Receiver via VirGS,M,E

Most effectively the proposed mechanism of spin (information), momentum and energy
exchange can work between Sender and Receiver, containing coherent molecular clusters -
mesoscopic Bose condensate (mBC) (Kaivarainen, 2001, 2005). The nonlocal spin/qubit

The described above mechanisms of nonlocal/instant transmission of spin/information,

9.4 The stochastic jumps of Cumulative Virtual Cloud (CVC) between primary VR0 and

secondary Virtual Replicas (VRn of elementary particles, as a possible explanation of two
slit experiments

In accordance to proposed mechanism of dynamics of sub-elementary particles -
Bivacuum interaction, forming the photons, electrons, etc. (Fig.1 and Fig.3), their primary
and secondary virtual replicas are existing. The properties of VR and their multiplication
VRM(r,t) of elementary particles, described in section 8, are dependent on their de Broglie
wave length, frequency and phase.

The frequency of de Broglie wave and its length can be expressed from eq.7.3 as:

We can see from the above analysis, that our model of duality does not need the
Bohmian ”quantum potential” (Bohm and Hiley, 1993) or de Broglie’s ”pilot wave” for
explanation of wave-like behavior of elementary particles and two-slit experiment.

45

Scattering of the photon on a free electron will affect its velocity, momentum, mass,
wave B frequency, length, its primary and secondary virtual replica (VRS) and feedback
influence of VRS on the electron, following by change of the interference picture. Our
theory predicts that applying of the EM field to singe electrons with frequency resonant to
their de Broglie frequency, should be accompanied by alternative acceleration of the
electrons and modulation of their Virtual Replica. This can be accompanied by ’washing
out’ the interference pattern in two-slit experiment as a result of induced decoherence
between particle and its virtual replica. This consequence of our theory of two-slit
experiment can be easily verified.

10 New kind of Bivacuum mediated nonlocal interaction between macroscopic objects
and possible temporal effects

In accordance to our approach, the remote interaction between macroscopic Sender [S]
and Receiver [R] can be realized, as a result of Bivacuum mediated interaction (BMI), like
superposition of distant and nonlocal components of their Virtual Replicas Multiplication
(VRMS  VRMR), described in previous sections.

Nonequilibrium processes in [Sender], accompanied by acceleration of particles, like
evaporation, heating, cooling, melting, boiling etc. may stimulate the nonelastic effects in
the volume of [Receiver] and increments of modulated virtual pressure and spin waves

The following unconventional kinds of effects of nonelectromagnetic and

non-gravitational nature can be anticipated in the remote interaction between macroscopic
nonequilibrium [Sender] and sensitive detector [Receiver] via multiple Virtual spin and
energy guides VirGSME (Fig.4), if our theory of nonlocal spin, momentum and energy
exchange between [S] and [R], described above is correct:

I. Weak repulsion and attraction between ’tuned’ [S] and [R] and rotational momentum
in [R] induced by [S], as a result of transmission of momentum/kinetic energy and angular
momentum (spin) between elementary particles of [S] and [R]. The probability of such
’tuned’ interaction between [S] and [R] is dependent on dimensions of coherent clusters of
atoms and molecules of condensed matter in state of mesoscopic Bose condensation (mBC)
(Kaivarainen, 1995; 2001; 2003; 2004). The number of atoms in such clusters is related to
number of VirGSME in the bundles, connecting mBC of in [S] and [R] and may be
regulated by temperature, ultrasound, etc. The kinetic energy distant transmission from
atoms of [S] to atoms of [R] may be accompanied by the temperature and local
pressure/sound effects in [R];

II. Increasing the probability of thermal fluctuations in the volume of [R] due to

decreasing of Van der Waals interactions, because of charges screening effects, induced by
overlapping of distant virtual replicas of [S] and [R] and increasing of dielectric
permittivity of Bivacuum. In water the variation of probability of cavitational fluctuations
should by accompanied by the in-phase variation of pH and electric conductivity due to
shifting the equilibrium: H2O  H  HO to the right or left;

III. Small changing of mass of [R] in conditions, changing the probability of the

inelastic recoil effects in the volume of [R] under influence of [S];

IV. Registration of metastable virtual particles (photons, electrons, positrons), as a

result of Bivacuum symmetry perturbations.

The first kind (I) of new class of interactions between coherent fermions of [S] and [R]

is a result of huge number (bundles) of correlated virtual spin-momentum-energy guides

46

VirGSME  VirSWS

   VirSWR
These guides can be responsible for:

between [S] and [R], meaning the nonlocal information and energy exchange;

b) the regulation of Pauli repulsion effects between fermions of [S] and [R] with

parallel spins;

c) the transmission of macroscopic rotational momentum from [S] of [R]. The
macroscopic rotational momentum, exerted by VirSWS, is dependent on the difference
between the external angular momentums of elementary fermions of [S] and [R].

The second kind (II) of phenomena: influence of [S] on probability of thermal
fluctuations in [R], - is a consequence of the additional symmetry shift in Bivacuum
fermions (BVF, induced by superposition of distant and nonlocal Virtual Replicas of [S]
and [R]: VRS VRR, which is accompanied by increasing of Bivacuum fermions

interaction between molecules of [R] and increases the probability of defects origination
and cavitational fluctuations in solid or liquid phase of Receiver.

0  1/0c2 is responsible for the charges screening effects in

The third kind of phenomena (III): reversible decreasing of mass of rigid [R] can be a
result of reversible lost of energy of Corpuscular phase of particles, as a consequence of
inelastic recoil effects, following the in-phase C  W transition of Ncoh coherent
nucleons in the volume of [R].

The probability of recoil effects can be enhanced by heating the rigid object or by
striking it by another hard object. This effect can be registered directly - by the object mass
decreasing. In conditions, close to equilibrium, the Matter - Bivacuum energy exchange
relaxation time, following the process of coherent C  W pulsation of macroscopic
fraction of atoms is very short and corresponding mass defect effect is undetectable. Such
collective recoil effect of coherent particles could be big in superconducting or superfluid
systems of macroscopic Bose condensation or in good crystals, with big domains of atoms
in state of Bose condensation.

The fourth kind of the above listed phenomena - increasing the probability of virtual

particles and antiparticles origination in asymmetric Bivacuum in condition of forced
resonance with exciting Bivacuum virtual waves was discussed earlier (Kaivarainen
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0103031).

It was demonstrated (Kaivarainen: http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207027), that the listed

nontrivial consequences of our Unified theory (I - IV) are consistent with unusual data,
obtained by groups of Kozyrev (1984; 1991) and Korotaev (1999; 2000). It is important to
note, that these experiments are incompatible with existing today paradigm. It means that
the current paradigm is timed out and should be replaced by the new one.

10.1 Temporal effects in evolution of complex
Virtual Replica Multiplication: VRM(t)

The 3D net of VirGSME, unifying the Universe, may transmit not only information, but
also kinetic energy and momentum from one cosmic objects to another via huge distance.
For such super-entanglement the remote interacting particles in regions should be ’tuned’ to
each other. The latter can be achieved by forced resonance of Bivacuum Virtual Pressure
Waves (VPW with pulsing elementary particles (see section 9.3).

The general formula for time, discussed in section (7), is:

47

The pace of time and time itself are positive (t  0, if the particles motion is slowing
down (dv/dt  0 and dv  0 and negative, if particles are accelerating. In the absence of
acceleration (dv/dt  0 and dv  0, the time is infinitive and its pace zero:

 conservation (eq. 3.1).

As far the Universe expands with acceleration: dv/dt  0 and v  0, it follows from
12.11, that the Universal time - ”TIME ARROW” is negative: t  0. However, the ’local’
time of each cooling planet and star is positive as far dv/dt  0 and v  0 in 12.11.
The permanent (t   collective motion of the electrons and atoms of 4He in

superconducting and superfluid rings, correspondingly, with constant velocity (v  const,
i.e. in the absence of collisions and accelerations, is a good example of dynamic system
with infinitive life-time.

In Bivacuum with superfluid properties the excitations, like quantized vortices and
rotating virtual filaments, like asymmetric Virtual Guides (VirG) with Tk  const, are
stable (t  . Such long - living Bivacuum excitations may represent at the pointed
conditions the primary and secondary Virtual Replicas (VR), generated in process of their
multiplication (VRM).

At conditions: [v  c  const, valid for the case of photons, we get from (12.11) the

uncertainty for time, like: t  0/0. The similar result we get for state of virtual Bose
condensate (VirBC) in Bivacuum, when the external translational velocity of Bivacuum
fermions (BVF and Bivacuum bosons (BVB is equal to zero (v  0  const. The
latter condition corresponds to totally symmetric BVF and BVB, when their torus (V
and antitorus (V mass, charge and magnetic moments compensate each other.

The uncertainty of time is valid also in part of Universe Virtual Replica (UVR),
presented by bundles of filaments of Virtual Guides (VirGSME, formed by polymerized
symmetric BVB or Cooper pairs of Bivacuum fermions [BVF  BVF, when
their external kinetic energy is permanent and equal to zero: Tk  0  const. In such
conditions the past and future are indistinguishable.

In any kind of virtual systems, like VR and VRM(r,t), the simulation of past and

future events is possible by Quantum supercomputer or Superconsciousness (see
Table 2 in section 12), because by the definition, the relativistic mechanics do not work
for them and the causality principle is absent.

Shifting of Bivacuum dipoles symmetry by physical fields (electric or gravitational),
accompanied by their acceleration/deceleration and acquiring the external kinetic energy,
may influence the value and even sign of pace of time of virtual replicas, i.e. their future or
past.

The time-dependent superposition of individual virtual replicas multiplication of
inorganic objects VRMObt and living organisms VRMLt of each star (solar) system
forms the Star system Virtual Replica (SVR). In turn, superposition of all stars systems
virtual replica SVR of Galactic can be responsible for formation of Galactical Virtual

48

Replica.

We put forward a conjecture, that as a result of ability of complex virtual replicas, like

human ones or Galactical virtual replica (GVR) with active medium properties to
evolution/self-organization and informational processing, this process can be considered as
a corresponding supercomputer or Galactical Virtual Consciousness GVC, as a function
of GVR(t):

GVC t  FGVRt   SSCt

    10.3

where: VRMObt and VRMLt are the selected/individual virtual replicas

multiplication of inorganic objects and living organisms not only in space, but also in time,
in the case of their existence in given star system.

It follows from our approach, that Superconsciousness of the Universe is a huge

hierarchical system, resulting from Bivacuum mediated interaction (BMI) between Virtual
Consciousness of individual planets (like Earth Noosphere), stars, star systems, Galactical
virtual consciousness, etc.

Our description of the Earth Virtual Replicas of the Universe, Solar system and Earth,

their interrelation with corresponding levels of Superconsciousness, have some common
features with Henry Stapp (1982) hypothesis of interrelation between collapsing of
superimposed mental states and actual world.

In each selected current moment of time t  tC, as a result of Virtual consciousness
i (tF) of current VR0

(VC) activity, a big number of discreet time - evolution versions VRF
with different probability (Pi of realization appears. The most probable future virtual

Clairvoyance or anticipation is a result of ability of gifted psychic [Sender] to ’search’,

from this future or past set of virtual replicas the most probable one. This complex process

49

The ’phantom’ effects where revealed in a system of interacting ’charged’ by intention

vessel of water and few other distant vessels with aqueous solutions, surrounding the
’charged’ vessel (Tiller, Dibble and Kohane, 2001 and www.tiller.org). After replacing the
’charged’ vessel far out of system, the ’memory’ of its presence remains for a long time.
The presence and orientation of large quartz crystal strongly affected the amplitude of
’phantom’ effect. In experiment, described, screening of the target [R] from
electromagnetic fields by Faraday’s cage did not influence on the distant interaction
between [S] and [R] and the phantom effect.

Consequently, there are a lot of experimental evidence already, confirming the
existence of new fundamental remote Bivacuum Mediated Interaction (BMI) between
Sender and Receiver, following from our Unified Theory.

11 Hierarchic Model of Consciousness:
From Molecular Bose Condensation to Synaptic Reorganization

Our Hierarchic Model of Consciousness (Kaivarainen:

http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0003045) is based on Hierarchic Theory of Matter
(Kaivarainen, 2000; 2001; http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0102086). The idea of Karl Pribram
of his book: ’Languages of the Brain’ (1977) of holographic principles of memory and
braining is very popular in quantum models of consciousness. Our model also supports this
general idea and try to transform it in concrete shape. The code way of keeping information
in the form of the effectons and deformons as 3D standing waves (de Broglie waves,
electromagnetic, acoustic and vibro-gravitational), generated by microtubules, containing
water in state of mesoscopic Bose condensation (mBC) - looks very effective and may be
used in quantum computer technology.

11.1 Stages of Hierarchic Model of Consciousness

In accordance with our HMC, the sequence of following interrelated stages is necessary

for elementary act of perception and memory, resulted from simultaneous excitation and
depolarization of big enough number of neurons, forming cooperative ensemble:

1. The change of the electric component of neuron’s body internal electromagnetic field

as a result of cells depolarization;

2. Opening the potential - dependent Ca2 channels and increasing the concentration of

these ions in cytoplasm. Activation of Ca2 - dependent protein gelsolin, which stimulate
fast disassembly of actin filaments;

3. Shift of A  B equilibrium between the closed (A) and open to water (B) states of
cleft, formed by  and  tubulins in tubulin pairs of microtubules (MT) to the right as a
consequence of piezoelectric effect, induced by depolarization of membrane of nerve cell;
4. Increasing the life-time and dimensions of coherent ”flickering” water clusters in
MT, representing the 3D superposition of de Broglie standing waves of H20 molecules in
hollow core of MT. It is a result of the water molecules immobilization in the ’open’
nonpolar clefts of ( dimers of MT;

5. Increasing the superradiance of coherent IR photons induced by synchronization of
quantum transitions of the effectons between acoustic and optic like states. Corresponding
increasing of probability of superdeformons (cavitational fluctuations) excitation in water
of cytoplasm;

6. The disassembly of actin filaments system to huge number of subunits, [gelsol]
transition and increasing of water fraction in hydration shell of proteins in cytoplasm. This
transition is a result of cavitational fluctuations and destabilization of actin filaments by
Ca2. Corresponding decreasing the water activity in cytoplasm - increases strongly the
passive osmotic diffusion of water from the external volume to the cell;

50

7. As a consequence of previous stage, a jump-way increasing of the nerve cell body

volume (pulsation), accompanied by disrupting the () ends of MTs with cytoplasmic
membranes occur. This stage makes it possible for MTs to change their orientation inside
neuron’s body;

8. Spatial ”tuning” - collective reorientation of MTs of simultaneously excited neurons

to geometry, corresponding to minimum potential energy of distant (but not nonlocal)
electromagnetic and vibro-gravitational interaction between MTs and centrioles twisting;
9. Decreasing the concentration of Ca2 to the critical one, when disassembly of actin
filaments is stopped and [gel  sol] equilibrium shifts to the left again, stabilizing the new
MTs system spatial configuration and corresponding nerve cell body volume and geometry.
This new geometry of nerve cells after fixation of () ends of MTs back to plasmatic
membrane - determine the new distribution of ionic channels activity and reorganization of
synaptic contacts in all excited ensemble of neurons after relaxation, i.e. short-term and
long-term memory.

This cyclic consequence (hierarchy) of quantum mechanical, physicochemical and

classical nonlinear events can be considered as elementary acts of memorizing and
consciousness. The total period of listed above stages can be as long as 500 ms, i.e. half of
second.

The resonance wave number of excitation of superdeformons, leading from our model,

is equal to 1200 1/cm. The experiments of Albrecht-Buehler (1992) revealed that just
around this frequency the response of surface extensions of 3T3 cells to weak IR irradiation
is maximum. Our model predicts that IR irradiation of microtubules system in vitro with
this frequency will dramatically increase the probability of microtubules catastrophes. It’s
one of the way to verify our model experimentally.

Except superradiance, two other known cooperative optic effects could be involved in

supercatastrophe realization: self-induced bistability and pike regime of IR photons
radiation. Self-induced bistability is light-induced phase transition. It could be related to
nonlinear shift of a  b equilibrium of primary librational water effectons in MT to the
right, as a result of saturation of IR (lb)-photons absorption. As far the molecular
polarizability and dipole moments in (a) and (b) states of the primary effectons - differs,
such shifts of a  b equilibrium should be accompanied by periodic jumps of dielectric
permeability and stability of coherent water clusters. These shifts may be responsible for
the pike regime of librational IR photons absorption and radiation. As far the stability of
b-states of lb effectons is less than that of a-states, the characteristic frequency of pike
regime can be correlated with frequency of MTs - supercatastrophe activation.

The Brownian effects, which influence reorientation of MTs system and probability of

cavitational fluctuations, stimulating [gel - sol] transition in elementary act of
consciousness - represent in our model the non-computational element of consciousness.
Other models relate this element to wave function collapsing (Hameroff and Penrose,
1996).

11.2 Special features of Virtual Replica (VR), generated by neurons

Our Hierarchic Model of Consciousness - HMC (Kaivarainen, 2000b; 2001) is based on
Hierarchic theory of condensed matter (Kaivarainen, 1995; 2000a; 2001). In accordance to
this theory, coherent properties of water clusters in microtubules (MT) and distant exchange
by IR photons, radiated by these clusters (mesoscopic molecular Bose condensate - mBC)
may be responsible for distant interaction between MT of different neurons and neuron
ensembles with similar orientation of MT. The existences of distant coherent interaction
(from 10 microns to one millimeter) in brain has been confirmed recently by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) by Warren and colleagues in Princeton university (Rizi et al.,

51

2000; Richter et al., 1995; 2000, see also http://www.princeton.edu/~wwarren/NMRintro).

In accordance to our HMC, each specific kind of neuron ensembles excitation -

corresponds to hierarchical system of three-dimensional (3D) standing waves of following
interrelated kinds: thermal de Broglie waves (waves B), produced by anharmonic vibrations
of molecules; electromagnetic (IR) waves; acoustic waves and vibro-gravitational waves
(Kaivarainen, 2000b; 2001). Corresponding complex hologram may be responsible for
distant quantum neurodynamics regulation and for morphogenetic field.

In this aspect our approach has a common features with ideas, developed by Pribram

(1991).

In our model we consider a number of quantum collective excitations, resulted from
coherent anharmonic translational and librational oscillations of water in the hollow core of
the microtubules (MT) with internal diameter about 120 Å. It was shown, that water
fraction, corresponding to 3D standing de Broglie waves, related to librations, represent 3D
mesoscopic molecular Bose condensate (mBC) in form of coherent clusters. The
dimensions of water clusters (nanometers) and frequency of their IR radiation may be
enhanced by interaction with walls of MT. It is most organized and orchestrated fraction of
condensed matter in biological cells. The Brownian effects, which influence reorientation
of MT system and probability of cavitational fluctuations, stimulating [gel - sol] transition
in nerve cells - may be responsible for non-computational element of consciousness. Other
models (Wigner, 1955; Penrose, 1994; Hameroff and Penrose, 1996) relate this element to
wave function collapse.

Change of the ordered fraction of water in microtubules in form of mBC, leads to
[gel-sol] transition, related to reversible [assembly - disassembly] of actin microfilaments,
change of osmotic pressure, pulsation of cells volume and membranes deformation.
Corresponding ”holomovement” of Virtual replica (VR) of living organism may be
responsible for mind-matter interaction, telepathy and other phenomena, related to
parapsychology. The bigger is number of MTs with similar orientation of coherently
interacting cells, the bigger is corresponding fraction of ordered water, very sensitive to
nerve excitation.

It is shown experimentally that the frequency of [gel  sol] transitions in cytoplasm,

regulated by Ca2 and enzyme gelsolin, is about 40 s1 (Miamoto, 1995, Muallem et al.
1995).

There are evidence, pointing that spatial properties of DNA and [MTs  microtubules
associated proteins (MAP)] system follow the Golden mean or Fibonacci series rule (see
related articles by Stuart Hameroff:
www.consciusness.arizona.edu/hameroff/info-processing01.htm). In accordance to our
results, it is a condition, optimal for exchange interaction of matter with Bivacuum by
means of Bivacuum gap oscillations. The introduced in section 3, notion of Tuning energy
of Bivacuum looks to be responsible for adaptation of biosystems dynamic and spatial
properties to those of Bivacuum in a course of long term biological evolution. It is a result
of forced resonance of [C  W ] pulsations of the electrons and nuclears of condensed
matter (water, proteins, DNA, microtubules, other microfilaments, etc.) with basic

Bivacuum virtual pressure waves: VPWq1
q  j  k  1. This kind of interaction is responsible also for realization of 2nd and 3d
laws of thermodynamics.

, corresponding to their lower excitation state:

Topological quantum computational/error correction in [MTs - MAP], based on
Fibonacci series, related directly to Golden mean (GM) condition, suggested by Roger
Penrose, may be responsible for resistance of subunits of MTs to decoherence. In turn, this
means resistance to decoherence of water clusters (primary librational effectons in state of
mBC) inside MTs, maintaining their stability.

52

It leads from our approach, that DNA, chromosomes, microtubules and bunches of MTs

may serve as effective virtual jet generators (VJG), increasing virtual pressure (VirP1,2,3
in selected direction. It may be due to coherent C  W pulsation of elementary particles,
composing atoms and molecules in state of mesoscopic molecular Bose condensate (mBC),
existing in these structures and modulating dynamics of Bivacuum.

At the ”rest” condition of cells the resulting concentration of internal anions of neurons

is bigger than that of external ones, providing the difference of potentials equal to
50-100mV. As far the thickness of membrane is only about 5nm or 50Å it means that the
gradient of electric tension is about:

100. 000 V/sm

i.e. it is extremely high. Depolarization of membrane usually is related to penetration of
Na ions into the cell. The processes of depolarization, accompanied by pulsation of nerve
cell body, - change the properties of membranes as Casimir chambers and, consequently,
the virtual replica of cell.

The virtual replica of cells, involved in nonequilibrium process of nerve excitation,
including acupuncture points, change in-phase with corresponding elementary acts of
consciousness.

Corresponding coherent cooperative changes: increments-decrements of kinetic energy

and momentum, accompanied, for example phase transitions of water clusters and lipid
domains in axons and nerve cells membranes participate, in accordance to our theory, in
nonlocal mind-matter and mind-mind interactions via Virtual Guides of spin, momentum
and energy (see Fig.12).

12. Bivacuum mediated Mind-Matter and Mind-Mind Interaction,
including Remote Vision, Telepathy, Remote Healing and Telekinesis

12.1 The stages of Psi channel formation

Theories of Virtual Replica (VR) of material objects in Bivacuum and primary VR

Multiplication (VRM), described in chapter 8, in combination with theory of Virtual
Guides (VirGSME (see chapter 9), are the background for explanation of different kind of
listed above Psi phenomena. The primary VR represents a three-dimensional (3D)
superposition of Bivacuum virtual standing waves VPWm

waves of molecules of macroscopic object (http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207027).

 and VirSWm

The infinitive multiplication of VR in space and time: VRM(r,t) in form of 3D packets
of virtual standing waves, representing iterated primary VR, is a result of interference of all
pervading external coherent basic reference waves - Bivacuum Virtual Pressure Waves
1/2) with similar kinds of modulated standing
(VPWq1
waves, forming primary VR. The latter can be considered as the object waves, making it
possible to name the VRM, as Holoiteration by analogy with regular hologram.

) and Virtual Spin Waves (VirSWq1



We put forward a conjecture, that the dependence of complex VRM(t) on time is a
consequence of its ability to self-organization in both directions - positive (evolution) and
negative (devolution) in nonequilibrium conditions. Virtuality of such systems, means by
definition, that relativistic mechanics and causality principle do not work for them.

Depending on the type modulation (section 8.1) VR and VRM(r,t) are subdivided on

the:

a) frequency modulated;
b) amplitude modulated;
c) phase modulated;

53

d) polarization modulated.
Only their superposition contains all the information about positions and dynamics of

atoms/molecules, composing object, possibilities of their evolution and devolution.

The nonlocal Virtual Guides (VirGSME) of spin, momentum and energy (chapter 9),
represent virtual microtubules with properties of one-dimensional virtual Bose condensate,
constructed from ’head-to-tail’ polymerized Bivacuum bosons (BVB) or Cooper pairs of
Bivacuum fermions (BVF). The bundles of VirGSME, connecting coherent atoms of
Sender (S) and Receiver (S) are responsible for nonlocal weak interaction between them.
The introduced in our theory Bivacuum Mediated Interaction (BMI is a new fundamental
interaction due to superposition of Virtual replicas of Sender and Receiver, because of
VRM mechanism, and connection of their coherent atoms via VirGSME bundles. Just
BMI(r,t) is responsible for remote ultraweak nonlocal interaction and different
psi-phenomena. For activation of psi-channels the system: [S  R] should be in
nonequilibrium state.

After our Unified Model, the informational (spin), momentum and energy

exchange interaction between Sender [S] and Receiver [R], representing Psi channel
formation, involves following three stages:

1. Superposition of nonlocal (informational/spin) components of [S] and [R] Virtual

The described above three stage of [S] and [R] Bivacuum mediated interaction (BMI)

provide formation of psi channel. For activation of this channel, the whole system:
S  R should be in nonequilibrium state.

We put forward a conjecture, that even teleportation or spatial exchange of
macroscopic number of coherent atoms between very remote regions of the Universe
is possible via coherent Psi-channels. If this consequence of our theory will be
confirmed, we get a new crucial method of the instant inter-stars propulsion.

For special case if Sender S or Receiver R is psychic, the double conducting

membranes of the coherent nerve cells (like in axons) may provide the cumulative Casimir

    12.1

effect, contributing Virtual Replica of [S] and [R].

The quantum neurodynamics processes in Sender (Healer) may be accompanied by
radiation of electromagnetic waves or magnetic impulses, propagating in Bivacuum via
virtual guides: VirGSME. Such kind of radiation from different regions of Sender/Healer has
been revealed experimentally.

The important role in Bivacuum mediated Mind-Matter and Mind-Mind interaction,
plays the coherent fraction of water in microtubules of neurons in state of mesoscopic
molecular Bose condensate (mBC) (Kaivarainen: http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0102086).
This fraction of mBC is a variable parameter, dependent on structural state of microtubules
and number of simultaneous elementary acts of consciousness (Kaivarainen:
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0003045). It can be modulated not only by excitation of nerve
cells, but also by specific interaction with virtual replica of one or more chromosomes
(VRDNA of the same or other cells.

The change of frequency of selected kind of thermal fluctuations, like cavitational ones,
in the volume of receiver [R], including cytoplasm water of nerve cells, is accompanied by
reversible disassembly of microtubules and actin’ filaments, i.e. gel  sol transitions.
These reactions, responsible for elementary act of consciousness, are dependent on the
changes of corresponding activation barriers.

The mechanisms of macroscopic quantum entanglement, proposed in our work, is
responsible for change of intermolecular Van der Waals interaction in the volume of [R]
and probability of selected thermal fluctuations (i.e. cavitational fluctuations), induced by
[S]. In this case, realization of certain series of elementary acts of consciousness of [S] will
induce similar series in nerve system of [R]. This means informational exchange between
ext , and their bundles,
VRR and VRS of two psychics via external Virtual Guides (VirGSME
forming Psi-channels, i.e. telepathy.

The specific character of telepathic signal transmission from [S] to [R] may be

S of microtubules by VRMDNA

of DNA of sender’s
provided by modulation of VRMMT
chromosomes in neuron ensembles, responsible for subconsciousness, imagination and
consciousness. The resonance - most effective remote informational/energy exchange
between two psychics is dependent on corresponding ’tuning’ of their nerve systems. As a
background of this tuning can be the described Bivacuum mediated interaction (BMI)
between regulative cells components of [S] to [R], like:

S

 2 centrioles  chromosomes

S

BMI

  2 centrioles  chromosomes

R

    12.4

In accordance to our theory of elementary act of consciousness and three stages of BMI

mediated Psi channel formation, described above, the modulation of dynamics of
[assembly  disassembly] of microtubules by influence on probability of cavitational
fluctuations in the nerve cells and corresponding gel  sol transitions by directed mental
activity of [Sender] can provide telepathic contact and remote viewing between [Sender]
and [Receiver].

The mechanism of remote healing could be the same, but the local targets in the body

of patient [R] are not necessarily the MTs and chromosomes of the nerve cells, but
centrioles  chromosomes of the ill organs (heart, liver, etc.).

The telekinesis, as example of mind-matter interaction, should be accompanied by
significant nonequilibrium process in the nerve system of Sender, related to increasing of
kinetic energy of coherent molecules in neurons of Sender, like cumulative momentum of
water clusters, coherently melting in microtubules of centrioles and inducing their
disassembly. Corresponding momentum and kinetic energy are transmitted to ’receiver -
ext
target’ via multiple correlated bundles of VirGSME

in superimposed VRMS,R (Psi-

55

channels).

The specific magnetic potential exchange between [S] and [R] via Psi-channels can be
generated by the nerve impulse regular propagation along the axons and depolarization of
nerve cells membranes (i.e. electric current) in the ’tuned’ ensemble of neuron cells of
psychic - [Sender], accompanied by magnetic flux. These processes are accompanied by
BVF  BVB  BVF equilibrium shift to the right or left, representing magnetic field
excitation.

The evidence are existing, that Psi-channel between [S] and [R] works better, if the

frequencies of geomagnetic Schumann waves - around 8 Hz (close to brain waves
frequency) are the same in location of [S] and [R]. However, the main coherence factor in
 ,
accordance to our theory, are all-pervading Bivacuum virtual pressure waves (VPWq1
with basic Compton frequency [0  m0c2/i, equal to carrying frequency of [Corpuscle
 Wave] pulsations of the electrons, protons, neurons, composing real matter and providing
entanglement. The macroscopic Bivacuum flicker fluctuation, activated by nonregular
changes/jumps in properties of complex Hierarchical Virtual replica of Solar system and
even galactic, related to sideral time, also may influence on quality of Psi-chanells between
Sender and Receiver.

Formation of the different kinds of virtual standing waves, representing nonlocal and
distant fractions of Virtual Replicas (VR)S,R of Sender [S] and Receiver [R], necessary for
VirGSME and Psi-channel formation, are presented in Table 1

VRM of DNA.

12.2 The Bivacuum mediated interaction between remote biopolymers,
cells and different organisms

In accordance to our Unified Model, all material objects, composed from elementary
particles, including biosystems: proteins, DNA, membranes, microtubules, cells, organs,
whole animals, etc. has a complex hierarchical virtual replicas multiplication (VRM) in
superfluid Bivacuum, described in previous sections.

The main factors of Bivacuum Mediated Interaction (BMI) are:
a) the carriers of information and spin, like Virtual spin waves (VirSW1/2);
b) the carriers of the momentum and kinetic energy via 3D system of nonlocal bundles
S  R, connecting big number of coherent atoms of

i

of Virtual Guides VirGSME
Sender (S) and Receiver (R);

c) the distant and nonlocal components of VRMdis and VRMnl are responsible for

Virtual Replicas and spatial images exchange between Sender and Receiver.

The virtual replica (VRDNA

S,R  of highly ordered parts of the eukaryote’s chromosomes
(introns), not participating directly in biosynthesis and including more than 95% of total
DNA, may play the active and very specific role in the [Mind-Matter] and [Mind-Mind]
interaction. The so-called nucleosomes represent long parts of DNA, tuned around the
histone octamer. The diameter of such nucleosomes (stable nuclear-protein complexes) is
about 110 Å. The histones are able to influence the DNA structure and functions. In
accordance to our Hierarchic theory of condensed matter (Kaivarainen, 1995; 2001:
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0102086), the high density and stability of nucleosomes and
native chromosomes provides condition for mesoscopic Bose condensation [mBC] of their
atoms at ambient temperature. The mBC may exist in form of so-called primary
translational and librational effectons (the latter are bigger) with dimension of tens of
angstroms, representing 3D standing de Broglie waves of atoms/molecules of biopolymers,
microtubules, chromosomes and membranes.

The existence of mBC means coherent C  W pulsation of elementary particles of

atoms, composing these clusters. The same is true for water clusters in state of mBC in
composition of hydration shells of DNA and in the holes of microtubules with internal
diameter about 140 Å.

The huge 3D net of VirGSME, connecting coherent hydrogens, oxygen, carbons,

nitrogen and other atoms in similar mBC of (S) and (R), allows the macroscopic quantum
entanglement between chromosomes, microtubules, ribosomes, etc. of distant cells and
even between different organisms. The nonlocal interaction ’in-vitro’ between the remote
(separated by tens of kilometers) samples of DNA from the same source, ribosomes and
collagen - was demonstrated by team of Peter Gariaev in 1992. The activation of this
interaction by irradiation of Sender samples with two laser visible beams with orthogonal
polarization, was used. The immediate remote interaction effect ’in vitro’ was registered by
change of light scattering of the Receiver(R) samples after Sender(S) activation.
We put forward a conjecture, that in natural conditions the activation and

58

synchronization of atoms de Broglie waves, stimulating the interaction between distant
chromosomes and ribosomes of the same or different organisms, can be realized by
coherent IR photons scattering on Sender structures. These IR photons are radiated by
water clusters (mBC), named primary librational effectons (Kaivarainen, 1995; 2001) in
microtubules of pairs of orthogonal centrioles. Corresponding nonequilibrium states should
enhance the effect of quantum entanglement via bundles of Virtual Guides (VirGSME,
connecting atoms of ’tuned’ parts of the remote DNA(S)DNA(R). The orthogonal
direction of IR photons radiation by microtubules may provide conditions of 3D effects of
the Sender treatment. The interference of one pair of orthogonal IR photons with
orthogonal IR photons of other cells can form the pattern of 3D standing waves, regulating
the morphogenesis.

It is possible also, that the IR photons, radiated by two orthogonal centrioles, each of
them containing about 50 microtubules, can be normally polarized as respect to each other,
like in described experiments with two laser beams.

The librational IR superradiation of coherent water clusters in microtubules can activate

the librational dynamics of water in DNA (Sender) hydration shell. In turn, this activation
is responsible for information, energy and momentum transmission from chromosomes of
Sender to Receiver, mediated by nonlocal bundles  VirGSME

The vibration frequencies of different fractions of vicinal water of chromosomes also may

means that corresponding collective excitations of model [water  DNA (chromosomes)]

be very effective in case of just these biopolymers. It follows from our theory, that the
evolution of matter and especially biosystems, occur under permanent influence of
Bivacuum virtual pressure waves, driving matter to Golden mean (GM) conditions on each
hierarchical level of its organization.

The nonequilibrium conditions, following from competition between Tuning Energy

i ,
(TE) of (VPWq1
i.e. to temperature of the absolute zero from one side and between thermal energy of living
organisms from other side, provide self-organization of matter and evolution of biosystems.
In the case of DNA macromolecule there are convincing evidences, that its large-scale

geometry obey the Golden mean proportions (see Dan Winter site:
www.soulinvitation.com/magneticx). For example: one 360 degree turn of DNA measures
34 Å in the direction of the main axis. The width of the molecule is 20 Å. These
dimensions ratio 34 : 20  1. 7  1. 618  1/ is close to Golden Mean within the limits
of the accuracy of the measurements.

The proposed in this work mechanism of VRMdis,nl and VirGSME  mediated quantum

entanglement between synchronized similar atoms of chromosomes of Sender and
Receiver, may stimulate the high-energy cavitational fluctuations of water near specific
sites of DNA/chromosomes. The energy of these thermal fluctuations is enough for
breaking the chemical bonds in DNA and can be accompanied by remote genetic
transmutation (RGT). Such a process can occur between cells (donors/senders) to cells
(acceptors/receivers) inside the same multicell organism or between different organisms.

The remote genetic transmission (RGT) was discovered by Dzang Kangeng in 1981 and

patented in 1992. Later it was confirmed by Gariaev’s group in 1994 - 2004. The
impressive results of this group are online: http://www.self-managing.net/genetica/.

The coherent bundles of  VirGSMES  R, mediating the transmission and
exchange of momentum and kinetic energy between complementary parts of remote
’healthy’ DNA/chromosomes of cells in system [SenderReceiver] do not induce any
damage in structure of both. In this correct case the S and R ’dance’ in the same dynamic
rhythm, coinciding by frequency, amplitudes and phase.

However, in the case of remote healthy DNA- S and ill DNA- R structures are
dynamically "incompatible" ’because of mutations/mistakes in the ’ill’ DNA-R. Similar
situation takes a place if DNA- S and DNA- R belong to different organisms. In both cases
the cumulative effect of  VirGSMES  R bundles may stimulate a high-energy
cavitational fluctuations in the hydration shell near regions of structural incompatibility of
DNA - R. The thermal energy of corresponding microbubbles collapsing corresponds to
6000K. It is much more than energy, necessary for covalent bonds breach between
nucleotides of DNA and amino acids of proteins.

Such selective Bivacuum mediated selected destruction of DNA-Receiver on fragments

and their assembly in new combinations are controlled by the Virtual Replica
Multiplication (VRMS) of DNA-Sender targeting DNA-Receiver by means of
 VirGSMES  R. The proposed in our work mechanism of Remote Genetic
Transmutation (RGT) may be realized in two cases:

1) DNA-S and DNA-R belong to the two similar population of cells of the same genetic

origin and one of population (DNA-R) is damaged (poisoned). In this case the induced by
DNA-S substitution of damaged regions of DNA-R can be realized by ’jumps’ of selected
transposons or plasmids in bacteria, localized in ’silent’ or ’junk’ part of chromosomes (R),
representing about 95% of genetic apparatus of any cell. We consider this ’silent’ DNA, as
a storage of very mobile genes fragments, duplicating the fragments of active genes,
participating in biosynthesis. In some sense one may said, that ’silent’ part of chromosomes
is a multiple ’backup’ of the active genes;

2) DNA-S and DNA-R belong to different organisms with different genes. In such case

of the induced Remote Genetic Transmutation (RGT), the DNA-S via bundles of
 VirGSMES  R and superposition of VRMS  VRMM may stimulate conversion
of part of silent genes or their fragments in DNA-R, which are close by primary structure to

60

DNA-S, to the active for RNA and proteins biosynthesis state. The new assembly of
activated fragments of silent part of DNA-R to coding genes, pertinent for DNA-S can be
realized under the control of VRMS  VRMM by the action of  VirGSMES  R.
As a consequence, the organism of Receiver start to be able for synthesis of RNA, proteins,
cells and their spatial organization (morphogenesis), pertinent for organism of Sender.

The Kangeng’s (1981-1992) and Gariaev’s (1992-2004) experiments with induced by
the artificial electromagnetic polarized radiation of Sender are in total accordance with our
mechanism of Remote Genetic Transmutation (RGT). As a result of this kind of interaction
between remote different species of animals or animals and plants, the organism of
Receiver gain a strong morphological features, pertinent for organism of Sender, but not for
Receiver.

These genetic transmutations where not as stable, as the primary genetic code of these

species. This is confirmed by disappearance of induced visible transmutations after 2-3
generation of hybrid animals or plants. Such instability can be explained by the action of
known mechanisms of genetic mistakes reparation in the process of transformed cells
division.

Dzang Kangeng (1981-1992) used hexahedron, cone, sphere and a parabolic-reflector
aerial, as a kind of forms, providing specific spinning (polarization) of the electromagnetic
(EM) field. In the Kangeng’s equipment the high-frequency generator of
orthogonally-polarized electromagnetic beams has been used, which repeatedly pass throw
the donor (Sender) and the accepting (Receptor) organisms, necessary for informational
exchange between them. Both organisms were remote, but interconnected by the
waveguide of EM polarized beams.

All known biopolymers are optically active, sometimes in very specific way.

Consequently, polarization of photons should increase the effectiveness of their scattering
on DNA and other biopolymers, dependent also on their frequency and density. The
polarization modulation of electromagnetic beams in device of Kangeng may influence the
small-scale librational dynamics of both DNA: Sender and Receiver, stimulating the
formation of bundles of very effective VirGSME between hydration shell and DNA of (S)
and (R).

Similar principles were used in Gariaev’s group device. Each of two orthogonally
polarized laser visible beams (  632 nm) transforms to wide band of radio waves (RW)
of frequency range: (103 106 s1 after repeatedly scattering on biosystem - Sender and
laser mirrors. Most probable interpretation of RW origination, in my opinion, is a quantum
beats between the primary visible photons of laser and secondary photons - scattered on the
object or laser mirror after multiple passing to and fro. As far the frequencies of secondary
- scattered photons are slightly shifted as respect to primary ones with   632 nm due to
inelastic Raman - like scattering, their interference and quantum beats are followed by
generation of radio-frequency EM radiation of wide range:

RW    1  2

0  2

    12.6

The wideness of radio-frequency range is determined by wideness of scattered

frequency: 2  2

0  2.

However, no visible photons, no radiowaves can serve themselves, as a carriers of
genetic or other information (signals) on distances of many kilometers, used in Gariaev’
group experiments.

In accordance to our theory, their role is only the activation of nonlocal Virtual Guides
of spin, momentum and kinetic energy [VirGSME S  R and nonequilibrium state
of superimposed VRMS  VRMM between coherent atoms of Sender and Receiver.
We suppose, that the hierarchical system of VRMS  VRMM is a crucial part of

61

morphogenetic field, which can be energetically realized/induced via
VirGSME S  R.

The spontaneous radiation of coherent ’biophotons’ by DNA of wide frequency range

has been revealed earlier by Gurvich (1977) and Popp (2000).

In few experiments the ’DNA phantom effects’ was revealed by Gariaev’s group. This

effect display itself, as keeping the same shape of auto-correlation function of light
scattering in device chamber even after replacement of DNA gel from chamber. This
unusual ’ghost’ effect confirms our theory of stable Ether Body - Virtual Replica (VR) and
Astral Body (VRM) (see section 8.3) of the object in Bivacuum and its ability influence the
interaction and dynamics of the air molecules and water vapor via VirGSME. The influence
of VR on the gas molecules interaction (for example, as a result of molecules polarizability
change due to variation of Bivacuum dielectric constant in volume of VR) was confirmed
by nitrogen jet washing out (destroying) the DNA phantom. Few minutes after nitrogen
’wind’ was stopped, the DNA phantom restores again.

Consequently, the ’phantoms’ are the reflection of stable ’Virtual Replicas’ of the
object. The mechanism of feedback reaction between VR and VRM of any object and
object itself is mediated by the internal VirGSME, connecting atoms of the same
object/organism.

The proposed in our work mechanisms of the Induced Remote Genetic Transmutation

(RT) and Induced Remote Morphogenesis (RM) of one kind of plants and animals by
another, mediated by superposition VRMS VRMR and bundles of Virtual Guides
between chromosomes of Sender and Receiver:

n

 VirGSMES  Rn

    12.7

activated by coherent IR radiation of microtubules (MTs) of orthogonal centrioles, makes it
possible the directed manipulation of RT, for example, by modulating the MTs properties
of Sender cells by nerve excitation or external resonant electromagnetic or acoustic fields
influence on the cells membranes.

The same mechanism explains the well known phenomena of remote healing. It follows
from our approach, that the ”Remote Healer" as a Sender, should be healthy himself and be
able to activate the interaction in system (pair of centrioles  chromosomes) in own cells,
corresponding to diseased organs of ”Patient - Receiver” by specific nerve system of
”Healer” excitation. Self-healing and regeneration of the damaged organs of the same
animals, like liver, kidney, heart and even head brain can be also realized via VRM and
VirGSME.

12.3 The mechanism of microbes adaptation to antibiotics, following from
proposed model of Remote Genetic Transmutation

In the framework of our approach, such important in medicine phenomena, like
adaptation of microbes to antibiotics can be explained in following sequence of stages:

1. The antibiotics, killing the microbes (for example, vancomycin) stimulate the chaotic

’jumps’ of plasmids in their DNA, making the chromosome system nonequilibrium and
unstable;

2. Finally, as a result of such casual chromosomes reorganization, the small population

of microbes emerge, stable/immune to this antibiotics;

3. Such stable microbes population increases due to their regular successful division;
4. This stable population stimulates the similar genetical rearrangement in sensitive to
antibiotic microbes population via described above mechanism of Induced Remote Genetic
Transmutation (RGT), provided by superposition of VRMS  VRMR and bundles of

62

Virtual Guides
microbes.

The chromosomes of Senders - stable microbes are stimulated for RGT by coherent IR

photons, radiated by water clusters inside microtubules:

The another kind of data, pointing to possibility of ’healing’ of different species of the
same populations, like bacteria and insects, are existing. In such experiments one group of
population, poisoned by antibiotics survived, if it was close enough to healthy population
of the same organisms. Our theory may explain this effect by resonant interaction between
Virtual Replicas Multiplications VRMS VRMR of healthy and poisoned populations of
bacteria (Parsons and Heal, 2002) and insects (Agadjanian, 2003) via VirGSME beam.

The Kaznacheyev’ team (1986 - 2002) also was conducted the extensive and successful

studies of interaction between remote living cells, unexplainable in the framework of
existing paradigm, but easily compatible with proposed mechanism of RGT.

The Chinese notion of meridians, connecting a big number of acupuncture points on the

surface of human body may correspond to multiple beams of VirGSME, connecting groups
of cells, containing similar by their resonant properties systems of:

chromosomes  pair of orthogonal centrioles  water clustersmBC

    12.8

not only on the surface, but also in the internal organs of human’s body. The external
influence on one or few of the surface acupuncture points should change the properties of
all other such points, connected by meridians. It means, that the Virtual Guides - mediated
n
 VirGSMES  Rn between human body’s organs and its modulation

interaction
by needles or otherwise (for example, using Audio-Video Skin Transmitter:
http://www.karelia.ru/~alexk/innovations/skin-transmitter.html) is a background of Chinese
medicine.

The water molecules H2O, containing two hydrogen atoms, tending to mesoscopic

Bose condensation at physiological temperature, are the best molecules for creation of
stable and effective double: (electron  proton)H virtual guides (VirGSME
 VirGSME
Taking this into account, we put forward a conjecture, that in volume of meridians the
water contents is higher, than outside meridians. If so, the dielectric properties of meridians
should differ from those of surrounding tissues. It is a way for experimental verification of
our idea.

The Homeopathic drugs, changing the water properties in cells in specific way,
including water in hydration shell of chromosomes, also may influence on Bivacuum -
mediated nonlocal interaction between remote cells of the same organism, shifting
[coherence  decoherence] equilibrium in meridians to the right or left. Our
Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP) could be a powerful tool for
understanding the role of water perturbations in homeopathy (Kaivarainen:
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207114).

12.4 The examples of Bivacuum mediated remote mental action
on different physical targets and their possible explanation

A big number of examples, collected by Savva (2000), demonstrate how Bivacuum
mediated interaction (BMI), generated by gifted psychic - ’Sender’ [S], can interfere with
real physical fields and targets [R] of nonbiological (like water) and biological nature:

1. Speeding up and slowing down the rate of americium 241Am nuclear decay - point to

63

influence of BMI of psychic on the energy exchange of quarks and gluons with Bivacuum
Virtual Pressure waves (VPWq
C  W pulsation;

i in the process of quarks (sub-elementary fermions)

2. Rotation of the plane of polarization of laser beam by 7-300 points to perturbation of

Bivacuum optical isotropic properties due to change of dynamic equilibrium between
Bivacuum fermions and antifermions to the left or right:

BVF  BVB  BVF

    12.9

under the psychic influence, accompanied by magnetic field excitation in Bivacuum (the
Faraday - like optical effect);

3. Deviation of the electrical resistance of a thermoresistor. This can be explained as a
result of BMI influence on resonance exchange interaction of the electrons with Bivacuum,
, induced by psychic, from frequency of
as a result of deviation of frequency of VPWq
C  W pulsation of the electrons, increasing or decreasing their kinetic energy (see
section 7);

4. Induction of a periodic electrical signal from a piezoelectric sensor. It can be the
result of effect, like described above, combined with influence of BMI on Van der Waals
interaction between atoms/ions of lattice, changing it rigidness and probability of thermal
fluctuations, accompanied by defects origination in lattice, via resonance exchange of
 
VPWq

i and C  W pulsation of the electrons, protons and neutrons;

5. Induction of a pulse magnetic field (100 nT and up to 27x106 nT) by psychic,
accompanied by rotation of a compasses needle. This effect is similar to that, described in
item 2. Our theory predict, that psychic-excited magnetic field will induce the rotation or
oscillation of the plane of polarization of laser beam;

6. Moving the plate of an encased precise analytical balance equivalent to 100 mg force
point to influence of BMI of psychic on gravitation. This can be a result of momentum and
kinetic energy transmission from the nerve cells of psychic to selected coherent atoms of
the balance via Virtual Guides of spin, momentum and energy (VirGSME;

7. Induction of a temporary peak in the Raman spectrum of tap water at 2200 cm1.
This can be a consequence of mechanism described above, confirming the existence of
VirGSME, connecting atoms (protons) of water in microtubules of nerve cells and in water -

target (Receiver) and the ability of bundles of
internal and external properties of water molecules;

N
 VirGSMES  Rn influence the

8. Temporary changes in the microstructure of water as observed through scattering of

laser beam (  632.8 nm) at various angles. The same mechanism, as described above;

9. Deviation of UV adsorption spectra of DNA - water solution in the area of 220- 280

nm in three independent observations. The same mechanism as above;

10. Predetermined by operator deviation from randomness with high probability of
various random number generators has been revealed in Princeton group. This can be a
result of asymmetric influence of BMI of the operator on elementary particles of
electronics, responsible for randomization of results;

11. Increasing of the concentration of dislocations (missing atoms in microcrystalline

structure) in ”metal bending” experiments with local increase of surface hardness. The
same mechanism, as in the item 4 listed above, describing the BMI influence on
piezoelectric materials.

It is interesting to note, that water treated with a magnetic field, like the psychic

intent-imprinted water, has stimulating effect on plant growth. The IR spectra of water, its
surface tension and crystallization patterns are similar for both types of water treatment
(Benor, 1992). The detailed study of magnetic field action on water was performed in our

64

work (Kaivarainen: http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207114).

Marcel Vogel (after Savva, 2000) claimed that quartz crystals of certain shape could
amplify the mental intent action on water. He demonstrated that in water, circulating around
an intent-charged crystal, the following changes are revealed:
-decreasing in surface tension, increasing of conductivity;
- a significant drop in the freezing point (as low as -30 degrees);
- bidirectional alterations in the pH up to 3 points;
- the appearance of two new bands in the IR and UV absorption spectrum, etc.
These important experiments point to ability of certain materials (crystal in this case)
for taping the properties of multiplied Virtual Replica (i.e. secondary VR) of psychic. This
process and the following processing/reading of taped properties, have a similarity with
fixation and reproduction of regular holograms from photomaterials. The role of ’reference
waves’ in reproducing of taped Virtual Replica in crystal play basic Virtual pressure waves
 of Bivacuum. The same mechanism may be responsible for the ’ghost’ or phantom
(VPWq
phenomena.

Dean and Brame found that healer - treated water demonstrated changes with both IR

spectrophotometry (indicating altered hydrogen bonding) and specific peaks with UV
spectrophotometry. The half-life for these effects lasted from three days to as long as three
years. For explanation of induction effects see items 6 and 7.

The long relaxation time (memory of water) is explained by our Hierarchical theory of

condensed matter (http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207114), as a result of very big resulting
activation barrier, separating the induced by BMI shift of dynamic equilibrium between 24
collective excitations in water from the equilibrium one.

It was demonstrated, that mental influence, as a carrier of information, cannot be
significantly blocked by any physical screening and that the effect does not depend on the
distance. This point to nonelectromagnetic nature of mind-matter interaction. The nature of
Bivacuum mediated interaction (BMI) satisfy this condition.

The remote influence of psychic on direct magnetic field sensor (ferroprobe

magnetometer), screened from the external regular EM influence was revealed by Ageev,
Dulnev, Kolmakov, etc. (2003). The detector of alternating magnetic field did not revealed
any significant changes, induced by remote ’sender/psychic’. This in accordance with
mechanism, described by equilibrium shift between Bivacuum fermions and antifermions
with opposite spins, mentioned above: BVF  BVB  BVF.

The active Psi-channel seems to be non-isotropic, i.e. strictly spatially directed. The

same group revealed that good psychic (sender) is able selectively change the electric
potential of the electrodes in the aqueous solution of sodium chloride (100 ml of 0.9%
NaCl solution) in one of two vessels, separated from each other for 2 meters only. The
distance between psychic and vessels was about 500 kilometers.

Well registered phenomena of remote viewing (RV) and precognition by Hal Puthoff
and Rassel Targ at Stanford Research Institute (1996) are confirmed in other laboratories.
Our theory of BMI explains the RV phenomena as a result of superposition of Virtual
replicas multiplication of Sender (psychic) and Receiver (target): VRMS  VRMR and
feedback reaction between this superimposed interference pattern and the nerve system of
the psychic, exciting visual centers of his brain.

Numerous studies have demonstrated (Targ & Katra, 1998) that size of the target (down

to 1 mm square) and distance between sender [S] and target (up to 10,000 miles) do not
appear to significantly impair signal perception. The electromagnetic shielding by Faraday
cage or sea water does not negatively impact remote viewing ability. These data, pointing
to anisotropic component of BMI, are in accordance with proposed mechanism of nonlocal

65

N
 VirGSMES  Rn, connecting coherent elementary
interaction via bundles of
particles of Sender and Receiver, as a part of BMI. We can see, that the proposed in this
work new resonant Bivacuum mediated interaction (BMI) between psychic and target can
explain all above described phenomena. The old, currently existing paradigm, failed to do
this.

12.5 The Biological and Biochemical effects of
Bivacuum Mediated Interaction between Sender and Receiver

There are two classes of remote healing (RH):
1) when the target (Receiver) is found by the healer (Sender) on the basis of a name,

location, birth date, etc. (in remote viewing terms, this is ”coordinate”). This process
involves superposition of Virtual Replica Multiplicators of S and R: VRMS  VRMR,
necessary for recognition and targeting and formation of Virtual guides bundles
N
 VirGSMES  Rn, connecting coherent atoms of S and R;

2) when the adjunct (an object previously treated by the healer, such as water, cloth, a
crystal, etc.) is used by the patient with or without the healer’s knowledge. In this case the
imprinting of VR of healer in adjunct object should take a place. The possibility of
imprinting/taping of secondary VR becomes possible because of primary VR multiplication
process. In this case the role of primary VR of the of the healer/sender takes the secondary
VR, imprinted in the adjunct matter.

In a 1991 Chien & al. report that they found the following biochemical effects when

studying the influence of a qigong master, generating Psi-field, on a culture of human
fibroblasts: a 1.8% increase in cell growth rate in 24 hrs; 10-15% increase in DNA
synthesis and 3-5% increase in cell protein synthesis in a 2 h period.

When the master emitted ”inhibiting” intention and corresponding VRM, the cell

growth decreased by 6%, while DNA and protein synthesis decreased by 20-23%,
respectively 35-48%.

Intent-modulated emission of biophotons from the hands of qigong practitioners is a
well-known phenomenon that has often been reported in the scientific literature. Eugene
Wallace reported measuring up to 100 time stronger emissions from the hands of gifted
persons compared to controls.

A study by Nakamura & al. (2000) reports an increase in subject’s hand biophotons
intensity associated with a drop in skin surface temperature during Qigong practice. The
significantly higher (up to 105nT) magnetic signals during Qi emission from hands of
qigong practitioners, as compared to the controls were revealed (Lin & Chen, 2001).

It was proposed by Oschman (2000) that under special conditions, resonant brainwaves
may entrain the body’s neural system to deliver healing frequencies to diseased tissues, or
become coupled to the Schumann resonance and thus transmit distant healing effects to the
target. But even accepting the Schumann resonance as a non-dissipative mechanism of
information transmission, the electromagnetism based approach still fail to explain such
effects, as influence of mental activity on internuclear and gravitational forces, described
above. Only certain Bivacuum symmetry and dynamics perturbations, proposed in our
theory, may be responsible for like phenomena. The positive role of Schumann resonance
in psi phenomena we may explain by its influence on the nerve system of Sender/psychic,
activating psi-abilities.

12.6 Superconsciousness of the Universe and its Evolution

The stability of each new synaptic distribution in the ensemble of nerve cells of
human’s brain, participating in elementary act of consciousness, is responsible partly for

66

long-term memory. Each redistribution in neuron’s system of brain and central nerve
system is accompanied by modulation of internal (ether) virtual replica VRin. This part of
our approach is close to idea of Karl Pribram about holographic nature of memory.
The ether body VRin  VRsur (see section 8.3) is generated by set of biological
structures, including synaptic configuration, responsible for memory on neurodynamics
level. After creation of such series of VRin,sur, in form of stable hierarchical superpositions
of 3D virtual standing waves, the corresponding primary ether body (VR) and its
multiplication VRM) or holoiteration become independent on material object. It is true
not only for ether VR of biological objects humans, animals, trees, etc.), but for any
inorganic objects as well (rocks, water, oil, etc.). Such mechanism explains the ether
memory formation of phantoms, as a system of secondary VR.

The primary virtual replica multiplications: distant VRMdis and nonlocal VRMnl
(see section 8) of human’s brain and nerve system provide the astral and mental memories,
interrelated with ether memory.

In turn, the combination of the individual astral and mental memories can be

incorporated into complex Virtual Replica Multiplication (VRM) of the whole
Earth/Planet: P-VRM .

It means that, the individual human’s VRMr, t, related to elementary act of

memorization and consciousness, can be incorporated in holographic structure of P-VRM.
Such mechanism stands for a imprinting of the individual mental activity to P-VRM, i.e.
the NOOSPHERE formation.

A kind of filters and thresholds, preventing ’downloading’ to Earth VRM (Noosphere)
the information in form of standing VPW, of already existing or ’destructive’ info, should
exist. The principle of selection of ”valuable” new information/perturbation can be based,
for example, on criteria of Golden mean or Hidden harmony of primary VRM construction,
as a background principle of [Bivacuum Matter] dynamic and spatial self-organization.
The notion of ”Collective Informational Bank” in such approach means formation of

Universe Virtual Replica (UVR) from huge number of planets (P-VRM) and stars
(S-VRM) of the Universe. The ability of processing of information may be a consequence
of ability of Universe Virtual Replica:

UVR  P  VRM SVRM

    12.10

to self-organization, evolution, devolution and formation of metastable states. The feedback
reaction between different components of Hierarchical UVR, can be considered, as a
Superconsciousness (SC) of the Universe”.

Such Superconsciousness (SC) have a properties of Quantum Supercomputer, able to
processing of information and organizing it by certain principles. This can be considered as
the evolution of Superconsciousness.

The conjecture of Universe with properties of ”Even Bigger Computer” with ability to
simulate future and memorizing past, was proposed also by Tom Campbell (2003). Earlier
similar ideas were discussed by Dean Radin in his book: ’The conscious universe: the
scientific truth of psychic phenomena’, HarperEdge, 1998, 362 pp, ISBN 0-06-251502-0.

where: VRM(r,t) is virtual replicas multiplication in space and time; CO means complex

The important contribution to realization of Superconsciousness, as a self-organizing
quantum supercomputer, is related to superposition of nonlocal and temporal components
of hierarchical systems of Virtual Replicas Multiplications VRM(r,t) and Virtual Guides
(VirGSME formation, providing different kind of Bivacuum mediated interaction (BMI).
The Hierarchical system of bundles of virtual microtubules, like the axons in humans
body, exchanging the information, momentum and energy between remote complex objects
of the Universe, containing coherent regions, i.e. neutron stars, black holes in centers of
galactics, etc. is a crucial part of the Universe Quantum Supercomputer or
Superconsciousness. The mechanism of possible time effects in huge domains of virtual
Bose Condensate (VirBC) in the Universe, formed by the bundles of nonlocal VirGSME was
described in section 10.1.

The possibility of feedback reaction between Superconsciusness and Planet Noosphere,

following from our concept, means that at proper conditions of Universe Virtual Replica
(UVR) high instability (bifurcation point), even small perturbation of planet P-VRM may
influence Superconsciousness.

12.7 The effects of virtual replica of asymmetric constructions,
like pyramids, on the matter

It looks, that Virtual Replica in Bivacuum, generated by psychic or by the

[Earth-Moon-Sun] dynamic system, can be imitated and modulated by some asymmetric
inorganic constructions, like pyramids, rings, etc. In work of Adamenko, Levchook (1994),
Narimanov (2001) and Miakin (2002) such effects has been demonstrated on examples of
following test-systems, placed inside pyramids: the cultures of microbes (dynamic
behavior), water (pH, O2 concentration), polymers solution (optical density), benzene acid
(UV absorption).

The Virtual Replicas of the pyramids or cones should be much more asymmetric, than
VR generated by cube. The effects of different virtual replicas on test systems, like water
and aqueous solutions, generated by such two hollow or filled structures, are anticipated to
be different also. This consequence of our model is confirmed experimentally by
Narimanov (2001). Keeping a flask with water under the pyramid during few days, makes
pH of water lower, than in control flask, placed under cube in the same room and
temperature. The ice, formed from the ’pyramid - treated water’ melts about 10% faster,
than the control ice. These results point to decreasing of intermolecular interaction in
pyramid - treated water.

The sharpening of the razor blades after their keeping inside pyramids, revealed

experimentally, may be a consequence of increasing probability of virtual charged particles
 antiparticles pairs origination in the internal VR of pyramid due to its asymmetry (i.e.
Bivacuum polarization). Consequently, the dielectric permittivity (0 of Bivacuum
increases. In turn, this induces the decreasing of ion-ion, ion-dipole and dipole-dipole
interactions in condensed matter (blade) inside the pyramid. As a result, the small structural
irregularities with bigger relative interface, interacting with perturbed Bivacuum, on the top

68

of blade, responsible for its sharpness, became unstable and gradually destroyed under the
effect of thermal fluctuations. The blade becomes sharper.

The dependence of internal VR of cavity on its shape, leading from our theory, is
confirmed by the different Lamb shifts in atomic spectra of samples in cavities of different
shape. It is known, that the Lamb shift is determined by screening of the electrons and
nuclears charges by the charged virtual vacuum particles and antiparticles. In our model
such a particles/antiparticles may be represented by BVF V V and
BVF  V V, acquiring nonzero charge, as a result of their torus - antitorus small
asymmetry.

12.8 The experimental program for verification of the proposed mechanism of
Bivacuum - Mediated Mental Interaction

Such a program should include the following directions:
1. Finding a way for increasing the psychic abilities to make the results of experiments

more reliable and reproducible with aid of special devices, like our Audio-Video Skin
Transmitter: www.karelia.ru/~alexk (see ’Innovations’);

2. Confirmation of correlation of properties of the Virtual Replica of any object,

including human’s body with dielectric permittivity (0 and magnetic permeability (0 of
Bivacuum, using Kirlian effect or its developed computerized version (Korotkov, et all),
named Gas Discharge Visualization (GDV);

Our theory explains high sensitivity of Kirlian effect to nerve and physiological state of

man by corresponding variation of threshold of air molecules excitation and ionization,
following their thermal collisions, accompanied the variation of (0 and Coulomb
interaction between polarized air molecules in strong gradients of electric field. The
photons radiation, registered by Kirlian effect and GDV is, therefore directly related to
density of virtual pressure waves (VPW and charge symmetry shift of Bivacuum dipoles,
induced by Ether and Astral Virtual replicas of the object under study;

2. The monitoring of behavior of microtubules in nerve cells, in cells culture and
isolated systems of microtubules ’in vitro’, like their cooperative assembly/disassembly,
providing interaction between such systems, may confirm the role of systems [centrioles 
chromosomes] in telepathic contacts and remote healing;

3. Confirmation of data, pointing to ability of crystals, like quartz, and aqueous systems
for imprinting of Virtual replica multiplication of living organisms: VRMr, t or Biofield
and elucidation of mechanism of imprinting, using our Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter
Properties (CAMP) (Kaivarainen: http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207114);

4. Systematic study of Bivacuum perturbation by biofield - VRMr, t, using Casimir

attraction force between conducting plates and spectral Lamb shift in the same set of
experiments, as a criteria of Virtual Replica Multiplication properties;

5. Confirmation of interrelation between the shape of the object and properties of
virtual replica, generated by this object. For example, the influence of hollow pyramid and
cube on water parameters (pH, conductivity, etc.) in vessel under them, is proved to be
different (Narimanov, 2001);

6. Confirmation of consequence of our theory, that any nonequilibrium processes, like
melting or boiling, are accompanied by replacement of virtual replica of the previous stable
phase of condensed matter by the new one. The monitoring of mechanism of long
relaxation time of virtual replica (phantom effect) of the object after its moving away, using
Kirlian effect of our Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP), with water as
a test system.

Main Conclusions

1. A new Bivacuum model, as the infinite dynamic superfluid matrix of virtual dipoles,
named Bivacuum fermions (BVF)i and Bivacuum bosons (BVBi, formed by correlated
torus (V and antitorus (V, as a collective excitations of subquantum particles and
antiparticles of opposite energy, charge and magnetic moments and separated by energy
gap, is developed. In primordial non polarized Bivacuum, i.e. in the absence of matter and
fields, these parameters of torus and antitorus totally compensate each other. Their spatial
and energetic properties correspond to three generations of electrons, muons and tauons
 and Virtual Spin
(i  e, , . The positive and negative Virtual Pressure Waves (VPWq
S1/2 are the result of emission and absorption of positive and negative
Waves (VirSWq
, resulting from transitions of V and V between different
energy Virtual Clouds (VCq
states of excitation, symmetrical in realms of positive and negative energy: j  k  q;

2. The symmetry shift between V and V actual and complementary mass and charge
to the left or right, opposite for Bivacuum fermions BVF and antifermions BVF, has the
relativistic and reverse to that dependence on these dipoles external rotational-translational
velocity. This shift is accompanied by sub-elementary fermion and antifermion formation.
The formation of sub-elementary fermions/antifermions and their fusion to stable triplets of
elementary fermions, like electrons or protons F
mass and charge origination, become possible at the certain rotation velocity (v) of Cooper
pairs of BVF BVF  around their common axis. It is shown, that this
rotational-translational velocity value is determined by Golden Mean condition:
(v/c)2    0. 618;

3. The fundamental physical roots of Golden Mean condition: (v/c)2  vgr

ext/vph

revealed, as the equality of internal and external group and phase velocities of torus and
antitorus of sub-elementary fermions, correspondingly: vgr
equalities are named ’Hidden Harmony Conditions’;

4. The new expressions for total, potential and kinetic energies of de Broglie waves of
elementary particles were obtained. The former represents the extended basic Einstein and
Dirac formula for free particle:

Etot  mV

c2  1  v/c2 m0c2  h2/mV

2
B

The new formulas take into account the contributions of the actual mass/energy of torus

(V and those of complementary antitorus (V, correspondingly, of asymmetric
sub-elementary fermions to the total ones. The shift of symmetry between the inertial and
inertialess mass and other parameters of torus and antitorus of sub-elementary fermions are
dependent on their internal rotational-translational dynamics in composition of triplets and
the external translational velocity of the whole triplets. The latter determines the external
v2/h and
translational momentum and the empirical de Broglie wave frequency: B mV
length: B h/mV

v;

5. A dynamic mechanism of [corpuscle (C)  wave (W)] duality is proposed. It
involves the modulation of the internal (hidden) quantum beats frequency between the
asymmetric ’actual’ (torus) and ’complementary’ (antitorus) states of sub-elementary
fermions or antifermions by the external - empirical de Broglie wave frequency of the
whole particles (triplets), equal to beats of similar states of the ’anchor’ Bivacuum fermion.
In nonrelativistic conditions such modulation stands for the wave packets origination;
6. The photon is a result of fusion (annihilation) of two triplets of particle and
antiparticle. It represents a rotating sextet of sub-elementary fermions and antifermions
with axial structural symmetry and minimum energy 2m0

ec2. The electromagnetic field, is a

70

result of Corpuscle - Wave pulsation of photon, exciting VPW  VPW and its fast
rotation with angle velocity (rot), equal to pulsation frequency. The clockwise or
anticlockwise direction of photon rotation, as respect to direction of its propagation,
corresponds to its spin sign: s  ;

9. It is demonstrated, that the dimensionless ’pace of time’ (dt/t  dTk/Tk) and time
itself for each closed system are determined by the change of this system kinetic energy.
They are positive, if the particles of the system are slowing down under the influence of
 of Bivacuum. The dt/t and t are negative in the
basic virtual pressure waves VPWq1
opposite case. This new concept of time extends the Einstein relativistic theory. For
example, our formula for time includes not only velocity, but also acceleration of the
particles;

Multiplication: VRM (r,t). The VR represents a three-dimensional (3D) superposition of
Bivacuum virtual standing waves VPWm
pulsation of elementary particles and translational and librational de Broglie waves of
molecules of macroscopic object (http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207027). The infinitive
multiplication of primary VR in space in form of 3D packets of virtual standing waves,
representing set of secondary VR: VRM(r), is a result of interference of all pervading
external coherent basic reference waves - Bivacuum Virtual Pressure Waves (VPWq1
Virtual Spin Waves (VirSWq1
VR. The VR plays the role of the object waves. This phenomena may stand for remote
vision of psychic. The ability of enough complex system of VRM(r,t) to self-organization
in nonequilibrium conditions, make it possible multiplication of primary VR not only in
space but as well, in time in both time direction - positive (evolution) and negative
(devolution). The feedback reaction between most probable/stable VRM(r,t) and nerve
system of psychic, including visual centers of brain, can by responsible for clairvoyance.
The VR of elementary particles coincides with notion of their anchor site, representing two
or three conjugated Cooper pairs [BVF  BVFas

11. The new general presentation of wave function, based on our wave-corpuscle
duality model, takes into account not only the external translational dynamics of particle,
but also the internal rotational one, responsible for the rest mass and charge origination;

12. The eigen wave functions, as a solutions of Shrödinger equation, describe the linear
superposition of multiple anchor site, as a possible alternatives for realization of particle’s
[C] phase;

BVFBVF from the adjacent microtubules, rotating in opposite directions,

BVB can be assembled from Bivacuum bosons BVBi by ’head-to-tail’ principle.

13. A possible Mechanism of Quantum entanglement between remote coherent
elementary particles: electrons and nuclears of atoms of Sender(S) and Receiver(R) via
Virtual Guides of spin, momentum and energy (VirGS,M,E is proposed. The single
VirGS,M,E
The doubled VirGS,M,E
can be formed by Cooper pairs of Bivacuum fermions [BVF BVFi, polymerized by
the same principle. The spin/information transmission via Virtual Guides is accompanied
by reorientation of spins of tori and antitori of Bivacuum dipoles. The momentum and
energy transmission from S to R is realized by the instant pulsation of diameter of such
virtual microtubule with frequency of beats, equal to difference between frequencies of
C  W pulsation of S and R. The length of VirGS,M,E, connecting fluctuating in space
particles of (S) and (R), also can correspondingly vary, because of immediate
self-assembly/disassembly of VirGS,M,E from the infinitive source of Bivacuum dipoles.

71

The Virtual Guides of both kinds represent the quasi 1D virtual Bose condensate with
nonlocal properties, similar to that of ’wormholes’. The bundles of VirGSME, connecting
coherent atoms of Sender (S) and Receiver (S), as well as nonlocal component of
VRM(r,t), determined by interference pattern of Virtual Spin Waves, are responsible for
nonlocal weak interaction;

14. The introduced Bivacuum Mediated Interaction (BMI is a new fundamental
interaction, resulting from superposition of Virtual replicas of Sender and Receiver,
because of VRM(r,t) mechanism, and connection of their coherent atoms via
VirGSMES  R bundles. Just BMI is responsible for remote ultraweak nonlocal
interaction. The system: [S  R] should be in nonequilibrium state;

15. The mechanism of Remote Genetic Transmutation (RGT), Remote Morphogenesis

(RM) and Remote Healing (RH) is proposed. It is based on conjecture, that the system:

[pair of orthogonal Centrioles  Chromosomes]

i

stands for sending and receiving of specific genetic information via bundles of
 VirGSME

S  R, connecting coherent elementary particles of [S] and [R];
16. Different Psi phenomena, like remote vision, telepathy, telekinesis, clairvoyance,
etc. where considered. The telepathic signal transmission from Sender [S] to Receiver [R]
may be provided by multiplication of virtual replicas of microtubules VRMMT
virtual replica of DNA VRMDNA

VRMMT,DNA
[assembly  disassembly] of microtubules and corresponding gel  sol transitions in
the ’tuned’ nerve cells ensembles in [Receiver] by directed mental activity of [Sender] can
provide telepathic contact and remote viewing between [Sender] and [Receiver]. The
resonance remote informational/energy exchange between two living organisms or psychics
is dependent on ’tuning’ of their [Centrioles  Chromosomes] systems in complementary
neuron ensembles via VirGSMES  R bundles;

be accompanied by strong collective nonequilibrium process (excitation) in the nerve
system of Sender. The excessive momentum and kinetic energy are transmitted from
Sender to Receiver or ’Target’ due to superposition of VRMr, tS  VRMr. tR and
multiple bundles of Virtual Guides, connecting ’tuned’ elementary particles (electrons,
protons, neutrons) of [S] and [R]:

We put forward a conjecture, that even teleportation or spatial exchange of

macroscopic number of coherent atoms between very remote regions of the Universe is
possible via coherent Psi-channels. If this consequence of our theory will be confirmed, we
get a new crucial method of the instant inter-stars propulsion.

The correctness of our Unified Theory (UT) follows from its ability to explain a lot

of unconventional experimental data, like Kozyrev ones, remote genetic
transmutation, remote vision, mind-matter interaction, etc. without contradictions
with fundamental laws of nature. For details see: http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0103031.
