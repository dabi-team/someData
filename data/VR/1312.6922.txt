Abstract Observations of the yellow hypergiant ρ Cas obtained in 2007–2011 in a wide
wavelength region with spectral resolution R ≥60 000 have enabled studies of features of
its optical spectrum in detail and brought to light previously unknown characteristics
of the extended atmosphere of the star. The radial velocity measured from symmetric
absorptions of metals varies with an amplitude of about ±7 km/s around the systemic
velocity Vsys = −47 km/s, due to low-amplitude pulsations of the atmospheric layers
near the photosphere. At some times, a velocity gradient was found in deep atmospheric
layers of the star. A slight velocity stratiﬁcation in the stellar atmosphere was detected
for the ﬁrst time, manifested as a diﬀerence of 3–4 km/s in the velocities measured from
absorption lines of neutral metals and of ions. The long-wavelength components of split
absorptions of BaII, SrII, TiII, and other strong lines with low excitation potentials
for their lower levels are distorted by nearby emission lines. It is suggested that the
short-wavelength components, whose locations correspond to the narrow velocity range
Vr(blue) from approximately −60 to −70 km/s, are formed in a circumstellar envelope;
one component of the D NaI doublet and the emission components of the FeII 6369.46
and 6432.68 ˚A ions are also formed there.
Keywords: massive stars, evolution, hypergiants, envelopes, spectra.

1. Introduction

Yellow hypergiants – rare stars whose prototype is ρ Cas (Sp = G2 Iae) are evolved high-mass
stars with super-high luminosities. Such objects are found near the luminosity limit on the
Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, in the instability region containing hypergiants with spectral
types from A to M [1, 2, 3]. The abundances of CNO elements and the sodium excess in the
atmosphere of ρ Cas [4] indicate that the star has already passed the red-supergiant phase,
and is now in a rapid evolutionary transition from a red supergiant to a Wolf–Rayet or LBV
star. The process of this motion towards higher temperatures is poorly studied.

Apart from their high luminosities, yellow hypergiants diﬀer from ordinary supergiants
in their high mass-loss rates via their stellar winds and in the presence of circumstellar
envelopes. The instability of these objects is also manifest through pulsation-type spectral
and brightness variations. The characteristic features of the pulsations of massive stars at the
stage of contraction of the helium core were considered by Fadeyev [5], who concluded that

long-period radial pulsations were improbable for ρ Cas. Along with the above manifestations
of instability, yellow hypergiants also undergo so-called “shell episodes”, when the star loses
matter especially eﬃciently and becomes enshrouded for several hundred days by the ejected
cool matter, which forms a pseudo-photosphere. In the case of ρ Cas, the most recent event
of this kind occurred in late 2000 – early 2001, when the star lost up to 3 × 10−2M⊙ [6].

On the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, ρ Cas is at the boundary of the so-called “yellow
void” [1] separating hypergiants from LBV stars in quiescence. Hypergiants near the void
exhibit negative density gradients and nearly-zero surface gravities log g [7], favoring the
formation of an instability region in the atmosphere. The pulsation amplitudes of yellow
hypergiants apparently strongly increases at the boundary of the yellow void, resulting in
increased atmospheric instability and shell ejection [1].

Close to ρ Cas in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, we ﬁnd the hypergiant V1302 Aql, bet-
ter known as the associated IR–source IRC +10420. The central star of V1302 Aql (spectral
type F8 Ia, luminosity of the order of 106L⊙) is surrounded by a dense gas and dust medium,
so that only the wind can be observed. Despite its fairly high eﬀective temperature, the star
is associated with a strong OH maser. One of the most important results from many-year
studies of V1302 Aql is the discovery of a rapid growth of its eﬀective temperature [8, 9].
Monitoring data from the last decades of the 20 th century indicate an acceleration of this
temperature increase [10]. In contrast to the hypergiant V1302 Aql, which has a massive
and structured envelope, ρ Cas is point-like in observations. An envelope far from the star
that would be detectable with the Hubble Space Telescope is not present in ρ Cas, providing
evidence that the duration of the high mass-loss stage has been short [11]. The peculiarity
of ρ Cas and its spectral variations were detected more than a century ago (cf. [12] and
references therein); however we still do not have a complete understanding of the physical
processes resulting in the complex, time-variable kinematic situation in the extended atmo-
sphere of this hypergiant. Fadeyev [5] notes that even the pulsation type remains unclear,
making monitoring important.

Our two decade of spectroscopic monitoring of the hypergiant V1302 Aql with the 6-m
telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory enabled us to draw conclusions concern-
ing its evolution [8, 10]. The similarity of the evolutionary stage and fundamental parameters
of V1302 Aql to those of ρ Cas stimulated monitoring for the latter rare yellow hypergiant.
The current paper presents the results of our optical spectroscopic observations of ρ Cas per-
formed in 2007–2011. Section 2 brieﬂy describes the observations and data analysis. Section 3
presents our results and compares them to those published earlier. Our main conclusions are
given in Section 4.

2. Observations, reduction, and spectral analysis

Spectroscopic observations of ρ Cas were carried out at the Nasmyth focus of the 6-m tele-
scope using the NES echelle spectrograph [13, 14]. The mean epochs of our observations (JD)
and the recorded spectral ranges are listed in Table 1. The observations were performed us-
ing a 2048×2048 pixel CCD chip and an image slicer [14]. A 2K×4K CCD chip was used
on September 14, 2011. Table 1 shows that this transition to a large-format CCD consider-
ably expanded the recorded wavelength range, ∆λ. The spectroscopic resolving power was
λ/∆λ ≥ 60000, with the signal-to-noise ratio S/N ≥100.

The one-dimensional spectra were extracted from the two-dimensional echelle frames using
the modiﬁed [15] ECHELLE routine of the MIDAS software package. To remove cosmic-ray
traces, we applied median averaging of two spectra taken just after one another. Our wave-
length calibration was done using spectra from a Th Ar hollow-cathode lamp. We checked

the instrumental agreement between the stellar and hollow-cathode lamp spectra using O2
and H2O telluric lines. To check the derived Vr values, we measured 15–20 telluric lines in
the spectra of ρ Cas with their long-wavelength end at 5930–6010 ˚A and up to 70–80 lines in
spectra with longer-wavelength ends. The rms uncertainty in the Vr measurements of nar-
row telluric absorption lines is ≤ 0.5 km/s (the uncertainty for a single line). The accuracy
is somewhat poorer in the case of ρ Cas, since the spectral lines are broadened by turbu-
lence: the microturbulence velocity in the atmosphere reaches 11 km/s [1]. The techniques
used for the Vr measurements derived from spectra taken with the NES spectrograph, their
uncertainties, and the sources of these uncertainties are described in more detail in [16, 17].

3. Main results

4. Eﬀective temperature of ρ Cas

We determined the eﬀective temperature, Teﬀ, using the spectroscopic criteria developed by
Kovtyukh [18]. This method is based on ratios of selected spectral lines that are sensitive
temperature indicators. A single pair of lines provides temperature with an uncertainty of
50–110 K, but using a set of criteria results in a fairly accurate mean value. We are able
to use more than 100 line pairs in spectra of F–G stars, making it possible to reach an
internal accuracy of 10–30 K. Table 1 shows that, due to the large line widths in the case
of ρ Cas, our uncertainty is 39–53 K for the spectra in the range 5200–6700 ˚A. Due to a
smaller number of available line pairs at ≈4400–6020 ˚A the accuracy is poorer in this range:
90–170 K. Table 1 shows that the eﬀective temperature varied during our observations in
the range 5777–6744 K, with the mean being about 6200 K. The temperature variations we
detected for ρ Cas in the course of its pulsation period exceed the temperature diﬀerence
∆Teﬀ≈750 K obtained earlier by Lobel et al. [19].

Peculiarity and proﬁle variations of spectral features

The proﬁles of strong absorption lines in the spectrum of ρ Cas are variable and, as a rule,
asymmetric: their short-wavelength wings are either raised above the continuum by vari-

able emission or are more extended compared to the long-wavelength wing. A good example
is the proﬁle of the BaII 6141 ˚A line presented in the upper panel of Fig 1, which plots
the residual intensity vs. the heliocentric radial velocity Vr. The short-wavelength wing
of the BaII 6141 ˚A line, which forms in upper atmospheric layers under the inﬂuence of
the stellar wind, sometimes attains values near −120 km/s, even reaching −170 km/s on
October 20, 2008. Variations in the extended short-wavelength wings reﬂect kinematic in-
stability in the upper levels of the atmosphere, which are subject to inﬂuence of the stellar
wind.

In addition to extended short-wavelength wings, the strongest absorption lines in the
spectra of ρ Cas also feature a peculiarity in their cores, which are permanently split into
two components. The splitting of strong low-excitation absorption lines in the spectrum of
ρ Cas has been known for a long time (cf. references in [20]). More than half a century ago,
Sargent [21] presented a long list of such spectroscopic features. The wide spectral range
recorded by us enabled us to identify 10–12 split absorption lines in the visible range, and
more than 100 in the extended wavelength range, at λ > 3500 ˚A. A list of split absorption
lines with the most trustworthy positions at λ > 3900 ˚A is presented in Table 2. Numerous
split features are also present in the shorter wavelength range, λ = 3500–3900 ˚A, but their
measurements are hindered by the fact that the spectrum is rich with blends. The lines with
wavelengths longer than 5100 ˚A were already listed by Sargent [21]; the shorter-wavelength
split absorption lines in the spectrum of ρ Cas were identiﬁed by us. We consider possible
origin of this splitting in the next section, which deals with our analysis of the velocity ﬁeld.

Our recorded spectral range contains the Hα line at six epochs. The complex absorption
and emission Hα proﬁle varies in time: the lower panel of Fig. 1 demonstrates that the
position of the absorption core, intensities of the emission components, and their intensity
ratios are all time variable. The varying position of the Hα absorption core indicates that
its formation region moves in the stellar atmosphere. Note that the displacement of the Hα
core during our observations was ≈16 km/s, while the earlier observations by Lobel et al.
[19] detected core displacements as large as 35 km/s. No strict correlation is observed in the
evolution of the Hα and BaII 6141 ˚A proﬁles.

It was proposed in [22] that the Hα emission was formed in outer atmospheric layers that
are thermally excited by shock waves. The emission is formed in thin high-temperature layers
behind the shock front. Recombination occurs at this location, and the resulting emission
lines should be seen against the absorption proﬁle when the amount of hydrogen ionization
due to the passage of the shock becomes high enough. The amount of ionization is related to
the velocity of the shock. Note that the shock velocities that must be provided for Balmer
emission to appear are much higher than the velocities observed for ρ Cas. In a model with a
single shock, there is a slight velocity gradient in the recombination region, which determines
the width of the emission line (taking into account integration across the visible hemisphere).
It is emphasized in [22] that the cases when the emission line width is determined by thermal
motions in a single high-temperature region and by several recombination regions formed at
the boundary of each turbulent element cannot be distinguished spectroscopically. For this
reason, the assumed turbulence spectrum is of key importance for explaining the observed
microturbulence velocity, 11 km/s.

Another eﬀect whose explanation requires the assumption of an ensemble of shocks with
recombination is the long-lived, virtually permanent, presence of emission features. For ex-
ample, a high optical depth of the heated layer in the Lα line was used in [23] to explain the
long-lived presence of Balmer emission in Mira stars. It is noted in [24] that it is diﬃcult to
explain long-lived Balmer emission in models with a shock emerging in the atmosphere, since
the high-temperature region is quickly cooled by free–free transitions. Thus, the assumption
of multiple shocks [22] is also required to explain the long duration of this emission. However,
if indeed the observed line splitting is due to an emission component that “pushes apart” the
remnant of a broad absorption line, we obtain an additional question: what is the excitation
mechanism for the selected bound–bound transitions? We will consider the multipleshock
hypothesis further in a special study.

We noted in the Introduction the similarity of the fundamental parameters and evolu-
tionary stages for the two cool hypergiants ρ Cas and V1302 Aql. However, the two stars
also have important diﬀerences. The ﬁrst is the mass-loss rate: for V1302 Aql, this is
3 ÷ 6 × 10−4M⊙/year, with possible episodes of increase to 10−3M⊙/year (see [25] and
references therein). This is one to two orders of magnitude higher than the upper limit for
the mass-loss rate of ρ Cas, 9.2 × 10−5M⊙/year [19]. The high mass-loss rate of V1302 Aql
has resulted in the formation of the powerful, structured circumstellar envelope observed by
the Hubble Space Telescope [25]. The presence of this envelope produces a large IR–excess,
making V1302 Aql a bright IR–source. The IR–ﬂuxes of this star in the IRAS bands are
higher than those of ρ Cas by a factor of 40–50. Despite the similarity of their MK spectral
types, the optical spectra of the two hypergiants are also considerably diﬀerent. Permitted
and forbidden emission lines, often with intensities exceeding those of the local continuum
by large factors, dominate the spectrum of V1302 Aql. The HI and CaII line proﬁles are
two-peaked, and lines of metal ions often possess P Cygni proﬁles [8, 9, 10]. The spectrum of
ρ Cas resembles that observed for V1302 Aql in the 1970s [26]: it is close to that of a normal
F–supergiant, with a modest addition of some emission features. The main diﬀerences from

6

Klochkova et al.: Kinematic state in the atmosphere of ρ Cas

the spectra of normal supergiants are its broader absorption lines, due to very high lumi-
nosity and well-developed atmospheric turbulence, and the splitting of the strongest metal
absorption lines.

Velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere and envelope of ρ Cas

The systemic velocity of ρ Cas

Lambert et al. [20] used observations of the IR spectrum of ρ Cas to determine the helio-
centric systemic velocity, Vsys = −48 ± 2 km/s. Lobel et al. [27] used the systemic velocity
Vsys = −42 km/s, while a later paper of Lobel et al. [19] assumes Vsys =−47 ± 1 km/s. We
have adopted Vsys =−47 ± 1 km/s, in agreement with the results of [19]. Note that the mem-
bership of ρ Cas in the stellar association Cas OB5 suggests the mean velocity of a sample
of 21 stars in the association, Vass = −44.5 km/s [28] for the systemic velocity of ρ Cas.

The radial velocity from symmetric absorption lines.
Lobel et al. [6] monitored the radial velocity of ρ Cas using narrow fragments, 45 ˚A wide,
centered at 5187 ˚A. We analyzed the velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere of ρ Cas using large
numbers of individual spectral features, a fundamental diﬀerence from the approach used in
[6]. Our wide wavelength range and the high accuracy of our velocity measurements from
individual lines enabled us to study the velocity ﬁeld using an unprecedentedly large number
of isolated single lines (several hundred in each of the spectra), as well as split lines.

Components of split absorption lines.

The second group of lines are the short-wavelength components of split low-excitation ab-
sorption lines. A list of split absorption lines in the spectra of ρ Cas is presented in Table 2.
The identiﬁcation and wavelengths follow the data of the spectroscopic atlas [29]; lower-level
excitation potentials were taken from the VALD database [30, 31].

The fourth column of Table 3 contains the velocity Vr(blue) averaged for lines of a given
group for each date. Three important points should be noted. First, the widths of the short-
wavelength components are smaller than those of the long-wavelength components, and their
unblended left wings have steeper gradients than do the right wings of the long-wavelength
components. This is clearly visible in the BaII 6141 ˚A proﬁle shown in the upper panel of
Fig. 1. Second, the positions of the short-wavelength components are close to the CO line
core in the near-IR [20, 32]. Obviously, the CO lines of an F–star can be formed only in
the circumstellar envelope. Third, Fig. 2 shows that the velocity of the short-wavelength
components Vr(blue) is not constant. It follows from Table 3 and Fig. 2 that the velocity of
the envelope layers where the envelope absorption lines are formed varies in time in a narrow
range, from −59.6 to −67.3 km/s. The temporal variations of the short-wavelength wings of
these components (see the proﬁles of the BaII 6141 ˚A line in Fig. 1 and of the NaI 5889 ˚A
line in Fig. 5) could be due to changes in the wind parameters.

Vr values measured from emission and absorption lines in the spectrum of ρ Cas exhibit
a large scatter, from −10 to −70 km/s. However, it follows from Fig. 2, which displays the
dependence of the heliocentric radial velocity Vr on the depth of the corresponding line, that
the velocities measured for each of the dates contain several fairly well isolated groups of
lines. The radial velocities measured for ρ Cas from these line groups and for our observing
epochs are presented in Table 3. The numbers of lines used to determine the mean velocity Vr
for each of the groups are given in brackets. The ﬁrst group includes the vast majority of all
spectral lines: isolated symmetric lines of metals that are weak or have moderate intensity.
The mean values corresponding to the positions of such absorption lines, Vr(sym), is given in
the third column of Table 3. It follows from this table and Fig. 2 that the velocity Vr(sym),
reliably measured from a large number of symmetric absorption lines, does not coincide
with the systemic velocity, and varies from epoch to epoch in the range from −39.6 to
−55.4 km/s. The mean value, Vr(sym) = −46.7 km/s, coincides with Vsys. These variations
reﬂect pulsation motions in layers close to the photosphere, with an amplitude of several
km/s around the systemic velocity.

Our position measurements for symmetric absorption lines also show a relation between Vr
and line depth on individual observing dates, indicating the presence of a velocity gradient
in the atmosphere of the star (see, for example, data for the spectra taken on September 30,
2009 and September 24, 2010). In addition, a diﬀerence by 3–4 km/s for velocities measured
from absorption lines of neutral atoms and ions was found for some dates. This is observed
for the spectra taken on February 21, 2008 and in 2010 as well as for both spectra of
January, 2011. Thus, besides the earlier known pulsational variations, we found a weak
stratiﬁcation of the velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere of ρ Cas. The diﬀerence between the
velocities measured from absorption lines of neutral atoms and ions reects inhomogeneities
in the outer atmospheric layers of the star. The detected diﬀerential line shifts vary in time,
hindering a simple averaging of the velocities from arbitrary groups of absorption lines. It is
obviously necessary to study the velocity ﬁeld using homogeneous groups of spectral features,
preferably those having similar intensities and ionization stages.

In addition, there is a slight velocity gradient at some epochs: Vr(blue) changes by 5–
6 km/s from shallower to the deepest layers. The velocity gradient for the short-wavelength
components of the split absorption lines increases the uncertainty of the mean Vr(blue) values
(Table 3, the fourth column). Note that the velocity derived from the CO proﬁle, which is
formed in the uppermost layers of the envelope, continues the trend for increasing envelope
expansion velocity shown by the strong absorption lines.

possible presence of a velocity gradient in the stellar envelope to explain the asymmetry of
the CO proﬁle.

The third group of lines is comprised of the long-wavelength components of split absorption
lines. Figure 2 shows that, for most of these spectra, the dependence of Vr on the line depth
is a continuation of the relations plotted for symmetric absorption lines. Note that the
uncertainties of the mean velocities are much higher for the long-wavelength (Table 3, ﬁfth
column) than for the short-wavelength components. This is probably due to the complex
character of the proﬁles of the long-wavelength components. We consider this in more detail
below.

Lambert et al. [20] noted that the proﬁles of resonance (and strongest subordinate) pho-
tospheric absorption lines in the spectrum of ρ Cas were complex as early as 1981. We also
believe that the long-wavelength components of the split absorption lines are ordinary strong
absorption lines formed in high atmospheric layers. Their radial velocities diﬀer from those
of the high-intensity, isolated absorption lines due to the velocity gradient, as well as those
of stationary emission lines formed in the circumstellar medium. The circumstellar emission
lines, whose positions in the spectrum of ρ Cas do not coincide with the systemic veloc-
ity, exceed the local continuum level during outburst [6]. For observations outside outburst,
the emission lines are weak, but they distort the long-wavelength components, shifting their
cores toward longer wavelength. Figure 3 presents the proﬁles of several absorption lines with
diﬀerent intensities in the spectrum obtained on September 24, 2010 by way of illustration.
The positions of absorption cores with low (FeI 6462 ˚A) and moderate intensity (SiII 6347 ˚A)
correspond to the mean velocity for this epoch, Vr(sym) =−40 km/s from Table 3. At the
same time, the core of the strong BaII 6141 ˚A line is shifted by approximately +8 km/s with
respect to the relatively weak absorption lines.

Figure 4 compares a fragment of the observed (September 24, 2010) and synthetic spectra
containing absorption lines with various intensities, including the split BaII 6141 ˚A line. The

calculations were done using the modiﬁed STARSP code [33], adapted for a Linux envi-
ronment. According to the data from Table 1, the eﬀective temperature for September 24,
2010 was Teﬀ≈ 6000 K. We took the surface gravity log g = 0.1, microturbulence velocity
ξt = 12 km/s, and slight deviations of the chemical abundances from the solar values from
[34]. Theoretical modeling of spectra does not provide the necessary accuracy for extremely
luminous stars. However, we did not attempt to accurately reproduce the line intensities,
since we were mainly interested in their positions. The position of the theoretical BaII 6141 ˚A
line proﬁle agrees well with the long-wavelength component in the observed spectrum. This
provides additional evidence supporting our suggestion that the long-wavelength components
of split absorption lines are formed in the same layers of the stellar atmosphere as those where
the symmetric, isolated absorption lines are formed. The short-wavelength component clearly
originates in the envelope.

Note that splitting of strong absorption lines was detected [35] in the spectrum of the post-
AGB supergiant V354 Lac, whose mass and evolutionary stage are very diﬀerent from those
of the hypergiant ρ Cas. Analysis of radial-velocity data from echelle spectra of V354 Lac
obtained using the 6-m telescope + the NES spectrograph shows that the strongest absorption

lines of metal ions (BaII, LaII, CeII, NdII) are distorted by a component formed in an
envelope expanding at a constant velocity.

Gesicki [36] used photographic spectra of ρ Cas taken by J. Smolinski during 1969–1970 to
study the temporal behavior of the BaII 4934, 5853 and FeI 5328 ˚A lines. The main conclusion
of this work was that the short-wavelength component is formed in an expanding circum-
stellar envelope with a very high gas temperature, ≈12000 K. Our results are consistent with
this formation region for the short-wavelength component. However, Gesicki [36] concluded
from monitoring of a small number of lines that neither component of the split absorption
lines varied their velocity Vr during the pulsation period. Our more accurate measurements
demonstrate that the positions of both components of the split absorption lines vary in time
with an amplitude of several km/s.

Recently, Gorlova et al. [32] suggested a diﬀerent explanation of the splitting of low-
excitation absorption lines observed in spectra of ρ Cas. They suggest that the splitting is
due to a stationary emission feature with Vr≈ −50 km/s formed in the circumstellar medium,
which overlaps with absorption lines broadened by strong turbulence. Their main argument
against the hypothesis that the short-wavelength components are formed in the circumstellar
medium is that the presence of two independent absorption components would require the
continual existence of layers moving both outwards and inwards towards the stellar center,
which can be ruled out for physical reasons.

Note that the assumption of oppositely directed motions (compression of some layers and
expansion of others) is justiﬁed in the 1D model atmosphere if both the zones of compres-
sion and expansion have densities and temperatures suﬃcient to form absorption lines with
detectable intensities. In this case, lines due to diﬀerent ionization states or excitation states
can dominate in diﬀerent zones. If the oppositely directed motions are present in diﬀerent
parts of the observed stellar hemisphere (for example, due to non-symmetric pulsations),

Figure 5. Proﬁle of the D2 NaI line in the spectra of ρ Cas at various epochs: 1 – February 21,

2011. The arrow marks the interstellar component, V(IS)≈ −50 km/s [37]. The vertical
dashed line is the systemic velocity, Vsys = −47 km/c [20, 19].

the condition for the line components formed in the ascending and descending parts of the
hemisphere to be simultaneously detectable is determined by the ratio of the combined areas
of the ascending and descending parts and the ratio of the corresponding temperatures (since
the contribution to the ﬂux is dependent on the temperature as well as the area).

Our proposed explanation for the observed splitting of the strongest absorption line sug-
gests a simpler pattern for the diﬀerential motions: low-amplitude pulsations plus expansion
of the upper layers of the extended atmosphere forming a transition to the envelope, plus the
presence of velocity gradients in the stellar atmosphere and envelope at some times. Another
important diﬀerence of our results from those of Lobel et al. [27, 19] or Gorlova et al. [32]
is that, using spectra over a wide wavelength range, we have been able to analyze velocities
from symmetric absorption lines whose proﬁles are not distorted by circumstellar features.
As a result, the pulsation amplitude we have found, about ±7 km/s, is half the value derived
in [27].

Other lines with anomalies.

In addition to broad components similar to those we see for the strongest absorption lines,
the D NaI line proﬁles (Fig. 5) contain a narrow absorption feature at Vr = −49.8 km/s and
a component near Vr≈ −29 km/s, poorly visible in our spectra. The absorption at Vr≈
−50 km/s has an interstellar origin, and corresponds to the location of ρ Cas in the Perseus
arm [37]. The interstellar NaI line corresponding to the Local Arm cannot be identiﬁed
against the long-wavelength photospheric component.

In the spectra s516015 and s538009, we measured an abnormal Vr velocity from the
FeII 6369.46 and 6432.68 ˚A ion lines. When these spectra were obtained, the short-wavelength
wings of the two lines, which have the same ionization potential χlow = 2.89 eV, were distorted
by emission, especially clearly expressed in the s538009 spectrum. The horizontal arrow in
the corresponding panel of Fig. 2 indicates the mean velocity of the emission component
of the FeII 6369.46 and 6432.68 ˚A lines in these spectra, Vr =−68.4 km/s. Obviously, these
wind emission lines were formed in the same layers as the short-wavelength components of
the split metallic absorptions.

In addition to the position measurements for the groups of metal lines noted above, we also
present the velocity derived from the absorption components of the Hδ, Hγ, Hβ, and Hα lines
for all the spectra containing neutral-hydrogen lines. The positions of the Hδ, Hγ, and Hβ
cores, plotted as crosses in Fig. 2, vary between the systemic velocity and the velocity derived
from the absorption lines of metal ions (triangles). At some epochs, the position of the Hα
absorption core (circled cross) also coincides with the systemic velocity, but, more often, this
line follows the Vr(r) sequence for the long-wavelength components of split absorption lines.

5. Conclusions

We have derived eﬀective temperatures and radial velocities from spectral features formed
in diﬀerent layers of the extended atmosphere of the hypergiant ρ Cas using 12 high-quality
echelle spectra taken during various observing seasons in 2007–2011. The eﬀective tempera-
ture of the star varied within 5777–6744 K.

Due to our wide wavelength range, we were able to study the velocity ﬁeld using an un-
precedentedly large number of isolated (several hundred in each spectra) and split (from 12
in the visual to 89 in the short-wavelength range) absorptions. The radial velocity derived
from weak, symmetric absorption lines of metals varies from epoch to epoch with an am-
plitude of about ±7 km/s relative to Vsys = −47 km/s, as a consequence of low-amplitude
pulsations in the stellar atmosphere. At certain times, we observed a relation between the
radial velocity and the line intensity, indicating the presence of a velocity gradient in deep
layers of the stellar atmosphere. For several phases, we also found a diﬀerence of 3–4 km/s
between the velocities measured from absorption lines of neutral atoms and of ions. Thus,
we are the ﬁrst to detect velocity stratiﬁcation in the atmosphere of ρ Cas.

We demonstrated that the long-wavelength components of the split BaII, SrII, TiII ab-
sorptions and of other strong lines with low excitation potentials for their lower levels were
distorted by a stationary emission feature, which shifted the line toward longer wavelengths.
Thus, the long-wavelength components of the split absorption lines are ordinary absorption
features; taking into account the distortion by the stationary emission feature at individual
epochs, the formation region and radial velocities of these components do not diﬀer from
those for single absorption lines.

The radial velocities of short-wavelength components were reliably determined using a
large number of features, and lie in a narrow range from Vr(blue)≈ −60 to −70 km/s.
The short-wavelength components of these absorption lines are formed in the circumstellar

envelope, where one component of the D NaI doublet lines and the emission components for
the FeII 6369.46 and 6432.68 ˚A ion lines are also formed.
