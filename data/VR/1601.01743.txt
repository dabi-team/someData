the so-called Choquard equation when N = 3, appears in the theory of Bose-Einstein con-
densation and is used to describe the ﬁnite-range many-body interactions between particles.
Here V (x) is the external potential, F (s) is the primitive of the nonlinearity f (s) and the
parameters ε > 0, 0 < µ < N . For µ = 1 and F (s) = 1

by S.I. Pekar in [42] to study the quantum theory of a polaron at rest. In [28] P. Choquard
suggested to use it as approximation to Hartree-Fock theory of one-component plasma. This
equation was also proposed by R. Penrose in [36] as a model for selfgravitating particles and
it is known in that context as the Schrödinger-Newton equation.

goes back to the pioneer work [24] by Floer and Weinstein. Since then, it has been studied
extensively under various hypotheses on the potential and the nonlinearity, see for example
[7, 16, 17, 24, 25, 26, 43, 44, 46, 48] and the references therein. In the study of semiclassical
problems for local Schrödinger equations, the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method has been
proved to be one of the most powerful tools. However, this technique relies on the uniqueness
and non-degeneracy of the ground states of the limit problem which is not completely settled

In [33, 15, 37], have been investigated qualitative properties of solutions and established regu-
larity, positivity, radial symmetry and decaying behavior at inﬁnity. Moroz and Van Schaftin-
gen in [38] established the existence of ground states under the assumption of Berestycki-Lions
type and for the critical equation in the sense of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. For

reduction when inf V > 0.
In presence of non-constant electric and magnetic potentials,
Cingolani et.al. [14] showed that there exists a family of solutions having multiple concentra-
tion regions which are localized by the minima of the potential. Moroz and Van Schaftingen
[39] used variational methods and developed a nonlocal penalization technique to show that
equation (SN S) has a family of solutions concentrating at the local minimum of V provided
V satisﬁes some additional assumptions at inﬁnity. In [51], Yang and Ding considered the
following equation

and by using variational methods, they were able to obtain the existence of solutions which
vanish at inﬁnity for suitable parameters p, µ. In [5], Alves and Yang proved the existence,
multiplicity and concentration of solutions for the same equation by penalization methods
and Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory.

We refer the reader to [3, 30] for related problems and [13, 31, 52] for recent advances on this
topic. Actually just a few papers deal with semiclassical states for local Schrödinger equations
with critical exponential growth. In [19], do Ó and Souto proved the existence of solutions
concentrating around local minima of of V (x) which are not necessarily nondegenerate. For
N -Laplacian equation in RN , Alves and Figueiredo [4] studied the multiplicity of semiclassical
solutions with Rabinowitz type assumption on the potential. Recently, do Ó and Severo [20]
and do Ó, Moameni and Severo [21] also studied a class of quasilinear Schrödinger equations
in R2 with critical exponential growth.

Hence it is quite natural to wonder if the existence and concentration results for local
Schrödinger equations still hold for the nonlocal equation with critical growth in the sense of
Pohozaev-Trudinger-Moser. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: on the one hand we study
the existence of nontrivial solution for the critical nonlocal equation with periodic potential,
namely we consider the equation

Assumption (f4) is inspired by [18, 52], but here we have the extra diﬃculty to handle integrals
where both the two nonlinearities F (s) and sf (s) appear simultaneously. This situation forces
us to assume condition (f4) which is sharper than the following assumption of [18]

Remark 2.3. It is worth to mention that actually estimate (2.17) can be improved, in the
sense that the constant
can be sharpened by exploiting I2, I3 and I4 and some additional
technical growth assumptions on f (s), which we omit here since do not bring to eﬀective
advantages in this context.
