ABSTRACT

We present a photometric and spectroscopic study of the Milky Way satellite
Laevens 3. Using MegaCam/CFHT g and i photometry and Keck II/DEIMOS multi-
object spectroscopy, we reﬁne the structural and stellar properties of the system. The
Laevens 3 colour-magnitude diagram shows that it is quite metal-poor, old (13.0 ± 1.0
Gyr), and at a distance of 61.4 ± 1.0 kpc, partly based on two RR Lyrae stars. The
system is faint (MV = −2.8+0.2
−0.3 mag) and compact (rh = 11.4 ± 1.0 pc). From the
spectroscopy, we constrain the systemic metallicity ([Fe/H]spectro = −1.8 ± 0.1 dex)
but the metallicity and velocity dispersions are both unresolved. Using Gaia DR2, we
infer a mean proper motion of (µ∗
α, µδ) = (0.51 ± 0.28, −0.83 ± 0.27) mas yr−1, which,
combined with the system’s radial velocity ((cid:104)vr(cid:105) = −70.2 ± 0.5 km s−1), translates
into a halo orbit with a pericenter and apocenter of 40.7+5.6
−5.9 kpc,
respectively. Overall, Laevens 3 shares the typical properties of the Milky Way’s outer
halo globular clusters. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that this system shows signs of mass-
segregation which strengthens our conclusion that Laevens 3 is a globular cluster.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the faint regime of Milky Way (MW) satel-
lites has been explored under the impulsion of large photo-
metric surveys. Among those, we can cite the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (York et al. 2000), the Panoramic Survey Tele-
scope and Rapid Response System 1 (Chambers et al. 2016)
or the Dark Energy Survey (The Dark Energy Survey Col-
laboration 2005). These surveys led to numerous discoveries
of faint satellites. Several old and metal-poor faint systems
have been identiﬁed as globular clusters (GCs) (Balbinot
et al. 2013, Laevens et al. 2014, Kim & Jerjen 2015, Kim
et al. 2016), although some of them require conﬁrmation
(Martin et al. 2016c). Because of their old stellar popula-
tions, they can be considered as the witnesses of the forma-
tion of their host galaxy (Strader et al. 2005) and bring
insights on low-mass galaxy formation. Furthermore, the
chemodynamics of those GCs can also trace some of the
current properties of their host (Pota et al. 2013). GCs

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS

can also be useful to constrain stellar population models
(Chantereau, Charbonnel & Meynet 2016). The fact that
these diﬀuse and small satellites survived for several billion
years can also bring more information on their formation
and internal processes (Baumgardt & Makino 2003, Renaud,
Agertz & Gieles 2017).

The GCs associated with the MW span a wide range of
luminosities, metallicities and distances (Harris 2010), but
only a few have been discovered in the outer reaches of the
halo (Rgal > 50 kpc). This speciﬁc group of clusters is in fact
suspected to not have formed in-situ, but rather as compan-
ions in nearby dwarf galaxies and accreted at later times in
the MW history (Mackey et al. 2010, Dotter, Sarajedini &
Anderson 2011). While clusters like Pal 14 (Arp & van den
Bergh 1960, dgal ∼ 71 kpc) or AM-1 (Madore & Arp 1979,
dgal ∼ 125 kpc) have been known for decades, only a handful
of fainter outer halo clusters were discovered in recent pho-
tometric surveys. Laevens 1/Crater (Belokurov et al. 2014,

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

N. Longeard et al.

Laevens et al. 2014) and Kim 2 (Kim et al. 2015) fall in this
category. Such faint satellites often lie in the so-called “val-
ley of ambiguity” where the frontier between dwarf galaxies
and old stellar clusters is not clearly deﬁned (Gilmore et al.
2007). Laevens 1 is a great illustration of that, as its very na-
ture was disputed at the time of its discovery. Indeed, while
Laevens et al. (2014) identiﬁed the system as a cluster, Be-
lokurov et al. (2014) proposed that the satellite could have
been a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy. This example only ac-
centuates the hardship of studying these faint, distant stellar
systems. In such an extreme regime, the combination of pho-
tometric, chemical, and kinematics data is needed to both
classify and understand those systems.

Laevens 3 (Lae 3) is a system ﬁrst discovered in the Pan-
STARRS 1 (Chambers et al. 2016, PS1) data by Laevens
et al. (2015). At the time, it was found to be compact (rh =
7±2 pc) and the existence of an RR Lyrae star in this region,
probably belonging to the system, allowed to constrain the
distance to the system (64 ± 3 kpc). Using this distance,
Laevens et al. (2015) found that the main sequence of Lae 3
was compatible with a stellar population of 8 Gyr, and a
metallicity of [Fe/H] = −1.9. From these properties, the
authors concluded that the system is a faint Milky Way
globular cluster.

In this work, we undertake a careful reﬁnement of the
properties of the satellite through deep broadband photome-
try with CFHT/MegaCam, as well as the ﬁrst spectroscopic
follow-up of the system using Keck/DEIMOS (Faber et al.
2003). Section 2 discusses the technical aspects of our obser-
vations. Section 3 details the photometric analysis that de-
rives the structural and colour-magnitude diagram (CMD)
properties of the satellite. In section 4, we present the dy-
namics of Lae 3 using multi-object spectroscopy, while sec-
tion 5 details the orbital properties of the satellite obtained
with the Gaia Data Release 2 data. Finally, the nature and
main properties of Lae 3 are discussed in section 6.

2 OBSERVATIONS

2.1 Photometry

The photometry used in this work consists of multi-
exposures MegaCam broadband g- and i-band images. The
exposure times are of 3 × 480 s for g and 3 × 540 s for i. The
observations were conducted in service mode by the CFHT
crew during the night of July 18th, 2015 under excellent see-
ing conditions (∼ 0.3(cid:48)(cid:48)), and the data reduced following the
procedure detailed in Longeard et al. (2018, L18). We use
the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit (CASU, Irwin &
Lewis 2001) pipeline ﬂags to perform the star/galaxy sepa-
ration. CASU also indicates all saturated sources. The cali-
bration of the MegaCam photometry (Boulade et al. 2003)
is performed onto the PS1 photometric system similarly to
L18. We ﬁrst cross-identiﬁed all unsaturated point sources
between PS1 and MegaCam. Only stars with photometric
uncertainties below 0.05 in both catalogs are then consid-
ered for the calibration. We assume that the transformation
between the PS1 and MegaCam photometry can be reliably
modelled by a second-order polynomial, with a 3-σ clipping
procedure.

All stars saturated in the MegaCam photometry are

directly imported from the PS1 catalog, for a total of 51,759
stars. Finally, the catalog is dereddened using the 2D dust
map from Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998) to determine
the line-of-sight extinction and Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011)
for the extinction coeﬃcients.

2.2 Spectroscopy

The spectroscopic run for Lae 3 was performed on the
night of Sept 7, 2015 (Julian date of 2457272.5) using Keck
II/DEIMOS. The targets were selected based on their dis-
tance to Lae 3 and their location on the colour-magnitude
diagram, using the PS1 photometry presented in Laevens
et al. (2015). A total of 51 stars were observed using the
OG550 ﬁlter and the 1200 lines mm−1 grating. The typi-
cal central wavelength resolution is R ∼ 8500, covering the

◦
spectral range from 6500 to 9000
A. The spectra were then
processed using the IRAF SIMULATOR package from the
Keck Observatories and the pipeline detailed in Ibata et al.
(2011). Stars with a signal-to-noise ratio below 3 as well as
the ones with radial velocity uncertainties above 15 km s−1
are discarded from the spectroscopic catalog. The resulting
catalog consists of 44 stars for which the spatial and CMD
distributions are shown in Figure 1. Finally, the instrumen-
tal systematic velocity uncertainty is chosen to be the same
as in Longeard et al. (2019), with δthr = 1.8+0.3

−0.2 km s−1.

3 BROADBAND PHOTOMETRY ANALYSIS

The region including Lae 3 is shown in the left panel of
Figure 1, with the stars observed spectroscopically colour-
coded by their velocities. The central region of the system
is densely populated. The colour-magnitude diagram within
two half-light radii of Lae 3 is shown in the right panel of
Figure 1. The great depth of the MegaCam photometry al-
lows us to probe the system two magnitudes below the Main
Sequence Turn-Oﬀ (MSTO) and clearly reveals the main se-
quence of Lae 3. Our spectroscopic sample extends all the
way down to the sub-giant branch, and suggests that Lae 3
possesses at least a few Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars. Four
RR Lyrae stars are located in the vicinity of the satellite ac-
cording to the catalog of Sesar et al. (2017). Among those,
only stars with a RRab classiﬁcation score greater than 90
per cent are selected, as the distance modulus measurement
of RRc stars can be biased. Two stars pass this criterion and
have a m − M of 18.87 ± 0.06 and 18.89 ± 0.06 mag respec-
tively. By doing the mean of these two distance modulii, we
obtain a distance modulus estimate of 18.88 ± 0.04 mag for
Lae 3 (59.7+0.2

−1.0 kpc in physical distance).

3.1 Structural and CMD ﬁtting

We aim to derive the structural and stellar population prop-
erties of Lae 3. As such, we rely on the technique presented
in Martin et al. (2016b) and L18. The stellar population
parameters that we aim to infer are the age A, metallicity
[Fe/H]CMD, the α abundance ratio [α/F e], and the distance
modulus m − M . The structural properties that are deter-
mined are the spatial oﬀsets of the centroid from the liter-
ature values (α = +316.72635◦, δ = +14.98000◦) X0 and

angle of the major axis θ, and the number of stars N ∗ of the
system within the dataset.

To derive the structural parameters, the satellite is as-
sumed to follow an exponential radial density proﬁle, while
the spatial density of the background is assumed to be con-
stant over the ﬁeld. The stellar characteristics are deter-
mined by assuming that the CMD of the satellite can be
considered as the sum of two components: a unique stellar
population for Lae 3, and a contamination from the fore-
ground stars. Given the appearance of the Lae 3 sequence
in Figure 1, these assumptions are reasonable as the diﬀer-
ences between isochrones in the metal-poor regime are not
signiﬁcant, except in the case of important spreads in both
age and metallicity. The modelling of the CMD contamina-
tion is done empirically, by selecting all stars outside 5rh of
the system. The CMD of this subsample is further binned
and smoothed by a gaussian kernel of 0.1 in both colour and
magnitude. The Lae 3 stellar population is, on the other
hand, modelled using old and metal-poor isochrones from
the Darmouth library (Dotter et al. 2008). The Lae 3 like-
lihood model is built by convolving each isochrone track by
the typical photometric uncertainties of the data at a given

(g0, i0). This model is then weighted by both the luminos-
ity function of the track considered, and the completeness
of the data at a given (g0, i0). This method is discussed in
further details in L18.

The distance inferred using the RR Lyrae in the ﬁeld
can be used as a prior for our analysis. Moreover, and an-
ticipating on section 4, the spectroscopic analysis of three
bright Lae 3 member stars allows us to infer the metallicity
of the satellite to be < [Fe/H]spectro >= −1.8 ± 0.1 dex. The
PDF of this result can also be used as a prior.

The structural and CMD parameters are inferred all
together and the results are displayed in Table 1, while the
PDFs are shown in ﬁgure 2. We ﬁnd that Lae 3 is spheri-
cal, with a half-light radius of 0.64 ± 0.05 arcminutes that
translates into a physical rh of 11.4 ± 1.0 pc. The measured
half-light radius is larger than that of the discovery paper
(Laevens et al. 2015; ∼ 0.4(cid:48)). To investigate this discrepancy,
the sample is split between bright (15.0 < g0 < 23.5) and
faint (24.0 < g0 < 25.0) stars, and the structural properties
of Lae 3 are derived in both cases. A signiﬁcant diﬀerence
arises in terms of half-light radius as shown in Figure 3: the
sample of bright stars yields a more compact size than with
the faint-end of the population. Such a discrepancy would
naturally arise in a satellite in which a mass-segregation pro-
cess has already occurred, and could explain the diﬀerence
between this work and Laevens et al. (2015) who analysed

the system with the shallower PS1 data. To test this, the
structural analysis is performed using directly the PS1 data.
The resulting PDF is shown as the dashed line in Figure 3.
The half-light radius inferred with this procedure is similar
to the one obtained by L15, suggesting that the larger size
derived from the MegaCam data is driven by less massive
stars below g < 22.5 mag and that Lae 3 is mass-segregated.
We compute the relaxation time of Lae 3 using the equations
of Koposov et al. (2007) and references therein to conﬁrm

that the satellite had enough time to mass-segregate. We
choose a mass-to-light ratio of 2 expected from old GCs (Bell
& de Jong 2001), a total luminosity of 1125 L(cid:12) determined
below, and an average star mass of 0.6 M(cid:12). The resulting
half-light relaxation time is around 2.2 Gyr, largely smaller
than our inference of the age of the satellite (13.0±1.0 Gyr).

Two favoured stellar populations are presented in Fig-
ure 2: with and without using the priors on the metallicity
and distance modulus coming respectively from the spectro-

in three cases: using stars with 15.0 < g0 < 22.5 in MegaCam
(solid black line), stars with 24.0 < g0 < 25.0 (solid blue line) in
MegaCam, and the PS1 catalog (dashed red line). The magnitude
ranges in the ﬁrst two cases were chosen so that the inferred
numbers of Lae 3 stars are similar. Lae 3 comes out as larger when
considering lower mass stars than when the analysis is performed
on a more massive sample, hinting at a mass-segregation process.

scopic analysis of section 4 and the two RR Lyrae in the sys-
tem. Without those priors, Lae 3 is found to be old (13.0±1.0
Gyr) and metal-poor (< [Fe/H]CMD >= −2.0 ± 0.1 dex).
The abundance ratio in α elements is [α/Fe]= 0.2 ± 0.2 dex,
while the distance modulus is m−M = 19.05+0.02
−0.10 mag, i.e. a
physical distance of 64.4+0.6
−3.0 kpc. This model is represented
as a dashed light green line in Figure 1 and nicely follows
the sequence of the satellite and the spectroscopic members
identiﬁed in the next section. The favoured model, i.e. the
one based on the metallicity and distance priors, is similar.
The structural properties, age, metallicity and α abundance
ratio are compatible. However, the satellite is found to be
closer (m − M = 18.94+0.05
−0.02 mag, which translates in a phys-
ical distance of 61.4+1.2
−1.0 kpc) in this case. This population,
represented as a solid green line in Figure 1, also follows the
features of Lae 3 in the CMD. The two isochrones are barely
distinguishable and the last model is the one used in the rest
of this work since it is based on a spectroscopic measurement
of the metallicity of the system. Using the favoured model,
two quantities are deﬁned: a “CMD probability member-
ship” that assigns a probability to a given star solely based
on its compatibility with the favoured stellar population of
Lae 3 and a “CMD and spatial probability membership”
that also takes the spatial location of a given star into ac-
count.

Using this CMD membership probability, we search for
potential tidal structures. To do so, the ﬁeld of view is spa-

ﬁeld of view. The magenta, pink and white lines outline the re-
gions with a density higher than 68, 95 and 99 per cent of the

tially binned with 0.2 arcminutes bins. The CMD probability
of all stars falling in a given bin are then added. This pro-
cedure therefore assigns higher values to bins that contain
stars compatible with the stellar population of Lae 3. The
result is shown in Figure 4. This analysis shows that the
satellite is highly spherical and that there is no tidal feature
in the ﬁeld of view compatible with the CMD properties of
Lae 3.

The luminosity of the satellite is estimated following the
method detailed in Martin et al. (2016a) which consists in
simulating thousands of CMDs with the stellar and struc-
tural properties of Lae 3 derived earlier, and compute their
resulting luminosities. This procedure yields a luminosity of
LV = 1125+221
−129 L(cid:12), translating into an absolute magnitude
of MV = −2.8+0.2
−0.3 mag. This result is roughly one magni-
tude fainter than that found by Laevens et al. (2015) in the
discovery paper of Lae 3. We observed a similar trend for
another faint satellite discovered by Laevens et al. (2015):
Draco II (Dra II). In L18, the inferred luminosity was sig-
niﬁcantly lower than found in the 2015 paper, and we con-
cluded that it is most likely due to the overestimation of the
number of giants in the system, probably due to the shal-
lowness of the PS1 data used for the discovery of both Lae 3
and Dra II. Though Lae 3 is clearly brighter than Dra II, it
is also signiﬁcantly more distant, and the same overestima-
tion eﬀect might have aﬀected the result of Laevens et al.
(2015), as using the same technique for a brighter MW satel-
lite (Longeard et al. 2019) did not yield such an eﬀect.

4 SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS

The distribution of the heliocentric velocities for all stars
in our spectroscopic sample is shown in the top panel of
Figure 5, along with their radial distances and spectroscopic
metallicities (if possible).

4.1 Dynamical properties

The Lae 3 population is not prominent, and its systemic
velocity overlaps that of the foreground MW stars (Figure
5). Our approach is similar to L18: the velocity distribution
is assumed to be the sum of the contamination (halo and
disc stars) and the Lae 3 population, both modelled with
diﬀerent normal distributions. To highlight Lae 3’s popula-
tion in the spectroscopic dataset, the individual likelihood
of each star is weighted by its spatial and CMD probabil-
ity estimated from the favoured structural model of sec-
tion 3 (Collins et al. 2010). This analysis yields a systemic
radial velocity of < vr >= −70.2 ± 0.5 km s−1. The 1-D
marginalised PDFs of the velocity parameters are repre-
sented in the left panels of Figure 6. As a consequence to
the low number of Lae 3 stars, the velocity dispersion is un-
resolved. Finally, six stars with a dynamical, structural and
CMD membership probability greater than 90 per cent are

identiﬁed as Lae 3 members and shown as ﬁlled circles in
Figure 5.

4.2 Spectroscopic metallicity

The individual metallicities of stars observed with spec-
troscopy can be estimated using the calibration of the Cal-
cium triplet (Starkenburg et al. 2010) for RGB stars, and
shown in Figure 5. Member stars fainter than 21 in the g
band, and with S/N < 10 are further discarded from our
spectroscopic catalog. Only three stars are left to infer the
systemic metallicity and metallicity dispersion of Lae 3, by
assuming that the metallicities are normally distributed.
This yields a spectroscopic metallicity of [Fe/H]spectro =
−1.8 ± 0.1 dex. The same analysis is also performed us-
ing the calibration of Carrera et al. (2013) for metal-poor
stars on the RGB and sub-RGB branch, and yields com-
patible results. Once more, low number statistics has a di-
rect consequence on our ability to constrain eﬃciently the
metallicity dispersion, which is found to be unresolved, with
σ[Fe/H] < 0.5 dex at the 95 per cent conﬁdence level. The
PDFs of both parameters are shown in the right panels of
Figure 6.

6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We present in this paper an analysis of the faint satellite
Lae 3 using deep MegaCam/CFHT broadband g- and i-band
photometry of Lae 3 as well as multi-object spectroscopy
observed with Keck II/DEIMOS. Lae 3 has a systemic ve-
locity that overlaps with the MW foreground contamina-
tion: (cid:104)vr(cid:105) = −70.2 ± 0.5 km s−1, but an unresolved velocity
dispersion. Using these results, six stars are unambiguously
identiﬁed as Lae 3 members, and three are bright enough
to be used to estimate the systemic metallicity of the satel-
lite. Lae 3 comes out as a fairly metal-poor stellar system:
(cid:104)[Fe/H]spectro(cid:105) = −1.8 ± 0.1 dex which places Lae 3 far oﬀ
the luminosity-metallicity relation of DGs (Kirby et al. 2013)
as shown in Figure 9. The metallicity dispersion is also un-
resolved. Similarly to Laevens et al. (2015), two RR Lyrae
stars are used to estimate the distance of Lae 3, and yield
a distance modulus of 18.88 ± 0.04 mag. Using these re-
sults as priors, we derive the structural and CMD properties
and ﬁnd a half-light radius of 11.4 ± 1.0 pc, a marginally
resolved ellipticity and a ﬁnal distance modulus measure-
ment of 18.94+0.05
−0.02 mag. A discrepancy between the half-
light radius of Lae 3 derived using bright and faint stars
hints that the satellite is mass-segregated. This hypothe-
sis is strengthened by the relaxation time of the satellite of
∼ 2.2 Gyr, much smaller than the age of the satellite found
to be 13.0 ± 1.0 Gyr by our CMD ﬁtting procedure. The
sphericity of Lae 3 and an analysis of the density of Lae 3-
like stars in the ﬁeld show no clear sign of tidal features that
might hint at a perturbation of the system and therefore its
ability to mass-segregate. The favoured stellar population
is metal-poor, not particularly enriched in α elements, and
at a distance of 61.4+1.2
−1.0 kpc. Finally, the orbit calculation
yields an outer halo orbit, with a pericenter of 40.7+5.6
−14.7 kpc
and an apocenter of 85.6+17.2

−5.9 kpc.

Lae 3 shows the main characteristics of MW globular
clusters: the satellite is fairly spherical and is at the same
time more compact and metal-rich than DGs of the same
luminosity (McConnachie 2012; Kirby et al. 2013), such
as Ret II (MV ∼ −2.7), Hor I (MV ∼ −3.4) or Boo II
(MV ∼ −2.7) as shown in the bottom-left panel of Figure 9.
Regarding the size and galactocentric distance of the satel-
lite, Lae 3 can be compared to SMASH 1 (Martin et al.
2016c). SMASH 1 has a size of 9.1+5.9
−3.4 pc, and is lying at
∼ 57 kpc of the center of the galaxy. The location and dis-
tance of SMASH 1 imply that it may be a satellite of the
LMC. However, Lae 3 is brighter (−2.8 vs −1.0 mag) and
is more metal-rich (−1.8 vs −2.2 dex). The top-left panel
of Figure 9 shows that the systemic metallicity of Lae 3 is
oﬀset by ∼ 0.7 dex from the metallicity-luminosity relation
of dwarf galaxies (Kirby et al. 2013). We have to turn to Pal
1 or Pal 13 (Harris 2010) to ﬁnd a cluster with a luminosity
comparable to the one of Lae 3 (respectively of ∼ −2.5 and
∼ −3.8 mag). Still, these two GCs are much more compact,
with a size of the order of the parsec.

Both the velocity and metallicity dispersions of Lae 3
are unresolved, although the small number of member stars
in our spectroscopic dataset does not give stringent enough

Figure 5. Heliocentric velocities versus radial distances (top
panel) and spectroscopic metallicities (bottom panel). Coloured
circles are non-HB stars with a S/N greater than 10, for which we
are able to derive the spectroscopic metallicities. The colormaps
stand for the metallicity (top) and radial distance (bottom). The
spectroscopic members are shown as ﬁlled dots.

5 GAIA DR2 PROPER MOTIONS AND ORBIT

To infer the orbital properties of Lae 3, we cross-match all
spectroscopic members and RR Lyrae stars with the Gaia
Data Release 2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018). Among
those, four stars have a proper motion (PM) measurement in
Gaia. Furthermore, all stars in the Gaia catalog with a CMD
and structural membership probability greater than 90 per
cent are included. Six additional stars are retrieved through
this procedure, and their PMs are compatible with those
of the spectroscopic members, as shown in Figure 7. The
uncertainty-weighted average PM of Lae 3 yields µ∗,Lae3
=
µLae3
= −0.83 ±
α
0.27 mas yr−1. These measurements take into account the
systematic error of 0.035 mas.yr−1 on the PMs for dSph as
shown by Helmi et al. (2018). We point out that this choice
of systematic error does not change our results, given the
measured uncertainties on the PM of the satellite.

We use the GALPY package (Bovy 2015) to integrate
the orbit of Lae 3. The MW potential chosen to inte-
grate Lae 3 orbit is a variant of the “MWPotential14” de-
ﬁned within GALPY, but updated with a halo mass of
1.2×1012 M(cid:12) (Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard 2016). Five thou-
sand orbits are integrated backwards and forwards over 5
Gyr, each time by randomly drawing a position, distance,
radial velocity, and PMs from their corresponding PDFs.
Around 20 per cent of the resulting orbits are not bound
to the MW. In the case where Lae 3 is bound to the MW,
the pericenter is at 40.7+5.6
−14.7 kpc and the apocenter is at
85.6+17.2
−5.9 kpc. The favoured orbit of the satellite is shown
as a solid blue line in Figure 8 and corresponds to a typi-

it is chemically enriched (right panels of Figure 9). Lae 3
is possibly mass-segregated, which implies that its internal
dynamics is ruled by purely baryonic two-bodies interac-
tions (Kim et al. 2015) and it is statistically incompatible
with the luminosity-metallicity relation of DGs. We there-
fore conclude that Lae 3 likely is a MW outer halo globular
cluster.

Figure 9. Comparison of Lae 3 with other GCs and dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way. Squares represent dwarf galaxies while circles
represent globular clusters, and the diamond corresponds to Lae 3. Triangles stand for recently discovered dwarf-galaxy candidates that
await conﬁrmation. Hollow markers correspond to systems for which no metallicity dispersion measurement can be found in the literature.
The solid line in the top-left panel corresponds to the luminosity-metallicity relation of Kirby et al. (2013) for dwarf spheroidals and
dwarf irregulars. Dashed lines represent the RMS about this relation, also taken from Kirby et al. (2013). Among the 123 globular clusters
presented here, the properties of 116 were extracted from Harris (1996) catalog, revised in 2010. For the remaining ones (Kim 1, Kim 2,
Kim 3, Laevens 1, Balbinot 1, Munoz 1 and SMASH 1) parameters of the discovery publications were used (Kim & Jerjen (2015), Kim
et al. (2015), Kim et al. (2016), Laevens et al. (2014), Balbinot et al. (2013), Mu˜noz et al. (2012) and Martin et al. (2016c)). Globular
cluster metallicity spread measurements are taken from Willman & Strader (2012) and references therein: Carretta et al. (2006, 2007,
2009, 2011), Cohen et al. (2010), Gratton et al. (2007), Johnson & Pilachowski (2010), and Marino et al. (2011). McConnachie (2012) and
Willman & Strader (2012) are used to compile the properties of the dwarf galaxies represented here. The 18 dwarf galaxies represented
here are: Bootes I (Belokurov et al. 2006; Norris et al. 2010), Canes Venatici I (Zucker et al. 2006b), Canes Venatici II (Sakamoto &
Hasegawa 2006), Coma Berinices, Hercules, Leo IV and Segue I (Belokurov et al. 2007), Draco and Ursa Minor (Wilson 1955), Fornax
(Shapley 1938b), Leo I and Leo II (Harrington & Wilson 1950), Pisces II (Belokurov et al. 2010), Sculptor (Shapley 1938a), Sextans
(Irwin et al. 1990), Ursa Major I (Willman et al. 2005b), Ursa Major II (Zucker et al. 2006a), Willman I (Willman et al. 2005a). Their
metallicity and metallicity spreads were drawn from Kirby et al. (2008), Kirby et al. (2010), Norris et al. (2010), Willman et al. (2011).
The dwarf galaxy candidates discovered recently and shown on this ﬁgure are Bootes II (Koch & Rich 2014), DES1 (Luque et al. 2016;
Conn et al. 2018), Eridanus III (Bechtol et al. 2015; Conn et al. 2018; Koposov et al. 2015b), Hyades II (Martin et al. 2015), Pegasus III
(Kim & Jerjen 2015), Reticulum II and Horologium I (Koposov et al. 2015a), Segue II (Belokurov et al. 2009), and the most signiﬁcant
candidates of Drlica-Wagner et al. (2015) : Gru II, Tuc III, and Tuc IV.
