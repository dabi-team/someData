Abstract. In this work, we tackle the problem of ternary eye movement
classiﬁcation, which aims to separate ﬁxations, saccades and smooth pur-
suits from the raw eye positional data. The eﬃcient classiﬁcation of these
diﬀerent types of eye movements helps to better analyze and utilize the
eye tracking data. Diﬀerent from the existing methods that detect eye
movement by several pre-deﬁned threshold values, we propose a hierar-
chical Hidden Markov Model (HMM) statistical algorithm for detecting
ﬁxations, saccades and smooth pursuits. The proposed algorithm lever-
ages diﬀerent features from the recorded raw eye tracking data with
a hierarchical classiﬁcation strategy, separating one type of eye move-
ment each time. Experimental results demonstrate the eﬀectiveness and
robustness of the proposed method by achieving competitive or better
performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Introduction

Eye tracking technology, which aims to measure the location where a person
is looking at, has been widely applied in various research and application ﬁelds
including the human-computer interaction [16,4], AR/VR [6,11], behavioral psy-
chology [10,3] and usability studies [21,8] in recent years. With the arising at-
tention and interests from researchers, eye tracking is becoming a potential and
promising driver for future immersive technologies.

One fundamental and signiﬁcant research topic in eye tracking is to identify
diﬀerent types of eye movements. There are several primary types of eye move-
ments: ﬁxations correspond to the situation where the visual gaze is maintained
on a single location, saccades are fast movements of the eyes that rapidly change
the point of ﬁxation, and smooth pursuits are deﬁned as slower tracking move-
ments of the eyes designed to keep a moving stimulus on the fovea [17]. Ternary
eye movement classiﬁcation [13], which seeks to classify three primary types of
eye movement, i.e., ﬁxations, saccades and smooth pursuits, is essential to the
above applications.

In this work, we tackle the problem of ternary eye movement classiﬁcation
from a probabilistic perspective by adopting the Hidden Markov Model in a

hierarchical way. The hierarchical structure makes it possible to consider sev-
eral diﬀerent data features in diﬀerent stages of classiﬁcation. The usage of the
Viterbi [9] and Baum-Welch algorithms [2] allows us to avoid the inconvenience of
selecting thresholds and to improve the robustness of the classiﬁcation method.
Experiments show that our proposed hierarchical HMM is able to achieve com-
petitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

2 Related Work

One of the most common and intuitive methods to separate ﬁxations from sac-
cades is threshold based algorithms, such as Velocity Threshold Identiﬁcation (I-
VT) [1] and Dispersion Threshold Identiﬁcation (I-DT) [18]. The former method
assumes the velocity of saccades should be larger than the velocity of ﬁxations,
while the latter one relies on the diﬀerence of duration and positional dispersion
between ﬁxations and saccades. However, the above single threshold-based algo-
rithms are unable to accurately separate smooth pursuits from ﬁxations due to
a variety of artifacts usually present in the captured eye movement signal.

The existing threshold-based state-of-the-art methods for ternary eye move-
ment classiﬁcation mainly combine several diﬀerent single threshold-based al-
gorithms. Velocity Velocity Threshold Identiﬁcation (I-VVT) [13] is a basic al-
gorithm that adopts two velocity thresholds, the data points with higher ve-
locity than the larger velocity threshold are classiﬁed as saccades, the points
with a lower velocity than the smaller threshold are classiﬁed as ﬁxations, while
the remaining points are considered as smooth pursuits. Velocity Dispersion
Threshold Identiﬁcation (I-VDT) [13] is another algorithm that combines I-VT
and I-DT [13]. I-VDT ﬁrstly ﬁlters out saccades by I-VT, I-DT is then further
used to separate ﬁxations from smooth pursuits. Velocity Movement Pattern
Identiﬁcation (I-VMP) [12] uses I-VT to identify saccades, and then employs
movement direction information to separate ﬁxations from smooth pursuits. All
the methods mentioned above rely on empirically selected thresholds to provide
a meaningful classiﬁcation on a targeted dataset.

In addition to the above threshold-based algorithms, video-based methods to
detect gazes have also been exploited in [7,14]. Dewhurst et al. [5] proposes to
use geometric vectors to detect eye movements. Nystrom et al. [15] aims to clas-
sify ﬁxations, saccades and glissades using an adaptive velocity-based algorithm.
Santini et al. [20] propose Bayesian method (I-BDT) to identify ﬁxations, sac-
cades and smooth pursuits. Another branch of more recent work adopts machine
learning techniques to tackle the problem. Identiﬁcation using Random For-
est machine learning technique (IRF) is used to classify ﬁxations, saccades and
post-saccadic oscillations in [24]. Zembly et al. [23] further propose a gaze-Net
to realize end-to-end eye-movement event detection with deep neural networks.
Startsev et al. [22] tackles the problem of ternary eye movement classiﬁcation
with a 1D-CNN with BLSTM.

Although the machine learning methods, especially deep learning, have been
widely applied in multiple research ﬁelds including the eye movement classiﬁca-

tion, one major drawback of these techniques is that the training process relies
on a large amount of data. In addition, the neural networks usually require re-
training when applied in a diﬀerent task or dataset. Our focus in this work is to
improve the robustness and performance of the threshold-based state-of-the-art
methods, even competing with the recent machine learning based state-of-the-art
performance.

3 Methodology

We present the proposed hierarchical HMM method in this section and provide
the corresponding pseudo-code.

Hidden Markov Model is a statistical model for time series based on the
Markov process with hidden states. The principle of HMM is to determine the
hidden state with a maximum probability according to the observable sequence.

4

Y. Zhu et al.

A traditional HMM takes three sets of parameters as input, which are the start
probability vector, transition probability matrix and emission probability matrix.
The ternary eye movement classiﬁcation can be formulated as a ﬁrst-order three-
state HMM problem, whose hidden states are ﬁxations, saccades and smooth
pursuits.

HMM relies on the distinguishable probability distributions of features to cor-
rectly deﬁne diﬀerent hidden states, otherwise, the maximum probability of each
hidden state may be incorrect if several hidden states have similar probabilities
given a certain observation sequence. In the case of eye movement classiﬁcation,
the probability distributions for diﬀerent movement types are usually repre-
sented by continuous Gaussian distributions [19]. The main challenge of ternary
eye movement classiﬁcation using the existing methods lies in the bias of the
features for smooth pursuits. While ﬁxations and saccades have very diﬀerent
positional dispersion and velocity features, smooth pursuits are rather ambigu-
ous in terms of dispersion and velocity since the steady state of a smooth pursuit
often contains corrective saccades, making the eye tracking data very noisy. To
this end, we propose to leverage diﬀerent features and introduce a hierarchical
strategy to tackle the problem. The core idea of our hierarchical HMM is to
perform HMM classiﬁcation for multiple times using diﬀerent features.

Firstly, we start by analyzing diﬀerent features of the raw eye positional
data as the pre-processing step, e.g., positions, velocities, accelerations, whose
objective is to determine the features that can be used to separate three eye
movement types in latter steps. After selecting appropriate features from pre-
processing, we then perform a ﬁrst-stage rough classiﬁcation on the eye tracking
data to separate saccades from the ﬁxations and smooth pursuits using the
HMM. We refer the ﬁrst-stage as rough classiﬁcation due to the reason that
the classiﬁcation results will be ﬁne-tuned in the latter stage. The second-stage
classiﬁcation adopts a diﬀerent feature to separate ﬁxations and smooth pursuits
by another HMM, using the ﬁrst feature as a ﬁne-tuning criterion at the same
time. The ﬁnal step of our hierarchical HMM is to merge the classiﬁed points
into complete eye movements with temporal duration criterion.

The pseudo-code of the proposed method is presented in Algo. 1. Compared
with the existing threshold-based state-of-the-art methods, our method has sev-
eral advantages: 1) the usage of HMM avoids the tedious work to select threshold
values as for previous algorithms and improves the robustness of the proposed
classiﬁcation method; 2) a hierarchical strategy with ﬁne-tuning technique fur-
ther improves the classiﬁcation performance. In the meanwhile, the proposed
method does not rely on a large amount of data for training and leverages sev-
eral diﬀerent features in a coherent way (e.g., use the feature from the ﬁrst stage
as a ﬁne-tuning criterion in the second stage). Experimental results prove that
our proposed hierarchical HMM method is simple, straightforward yet eﬀective.

4 Experiments

In this section, we present the experimental results obtained with the proposed
method. The comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the
robustness and eﬀectiveness of the proposed hierarchical HMM. An ablation
study is also included to show the contributions of the hierarchical structure.

4.1 Dataset and Evaluation Metrics

We use the eye tracking dataset recorded from the previous research work [13] for
experiments. The data are recorded by the EyeLink 100 eyetracker at 1000 Hz
on a 21-in monitor and contain 11 subjects, containing the human annotations
as either clean or noisy data.

Seven diﬀerent behavior scores are used as quantitative evaluation metrics
for our experiments. Saccade quantitative score (SQnS), ﬁxation quantitative
score (FQnS) and smooth pursuit quantitative score (PQnS) are used to mea-
sure the amount of saccades, ﬁxation and smooth pursuit behavior in response
to a stimulus, respectively [12]. Fixation qualitative score (FQlS), smooth pur-
suit qualitative score for positional accuracy (PQlS P) and for velocity accuracy
(PQlS V) are to compare the proximity of the detected smooth pursuit signal
with the signal presented in the stimuli [13]. Misclassiﬁed ﬁxation score (Mis-
Fix) of the smooth pursuit is deﬁned as the ration between misclassiﬁed smooth
pursuit points and the total number of ﬁxation points in the stimuli. The ideal
number of MisFix should consider the practical latency situation where smooth
pursuit continues when the stimulus changes from smooth pursuit to ﬁxation.

4.2 Implementations

We compare our proposed hierarchical HMM method with six baselines: I-
VVT [13], I-VDT [13], I-VMP [12], IRF [24], I-BDT [20] and 1DCNN [22]. Among
six baselines, I-VVT, I-VDT, and I-VMP are threshold-based methods, all the
threshold values are optimized for diﬀerent subject recordings in our experiments
for comparison. For the IRF, we use the same selected features (i.e., velocity and
position) as for our proposed method. For the I-BDT, we follow the parameters
chosen in [20]. For the 1DCNN, we take the pre-trained model and ﬁne-tune it
on the recording data (except those used for testing) from our targeted dataset.
For our proposed hierarchical HMM method, we use the parameters reported
in [19] for the initialization in HMM. We iterate the Viterbi and Baum-Welch
algorithms for 3 times to learn and update the parameters for HMM. For the
ﬁnal Merge function, the merge time interval threshold we use is 75ms, the merge
distance is 0.5◦.

manually evaluated as ”Medium”, ”Good” and ”Bad” in the eye tracking data
quality [13]. The ideal scores and manually classiﬁcation results are also reported
for comparison, the calculation of the ideal behavior scores considers the actual
physiological reactions of humans when performing diﬀerent types of eye move-
ments.

The quantitative experimental results are presented in Table 1. We observe
that our proposed hierarchical HMM method achieves promising performance
compared to the other baseline methods and is much closer to human perfor-
mance (i.e., manual). The I-VVT algorithm has the worst performance as ex-
pected due to the reason that it only considers the velocity and separates the
eye movement by two simple threshold values. The I-VDT and I-VMP are able
to separate ﬁxations, saccades and smooth pursuits, and I-VDT has better per-
formance compared to I-VMP, achieving a MixFix score closer to the ideal one.
Other machine learning based methods IRF, I-BDT, and 1DCNN achieve good
performance in general, however, we observe that 1DCNN has relatively lower
behavior scores in detecting the smooth pursuit. One possible reason for its
under-performance could be the limited amount of smooth pursuit data for ﬁne-
tuning. Since the original model was trained in a diﬀerent dataset and ﬁne-tuned
in our experiments, the transfer learning process may be less eﬀective compared

to retraining the entire network model, which also reveals one of the limitations
about those ”data-driven” methods. Our proposed hierarchical HMM outper-
forms the other considered methods, especially the threshold-based methods, in
most of the behavior scores and it is worth noting that the proposed method has
behavior scores close to the manually evaluated results.

We also present the qualitative classiﬁcation results in Fig. 1. Due to the
reason that the I-VVT basically fails in this ternary eye movement classiﬁcation
task, we do not include the classiﬁcation results of I-VVT in the ﬁgure. The
qualitative results are consistent with the previous quantitative results. Notably,
our proposed hierarchical HMM method succeeds in detecting an unexpected
saccade while most of the other methods detect it either as smooth pursuit or
ﬁxation.
Feature Analysis. In our experiments, we propose a pre-processing step to
analyze diﬀerent features from raw data. We analyze velocity, position and ac-
celeration features, and select velocity and position as two features used for the
hierarchical HMM method. Velocity feature is used in the ﬁrst HMM to ﬁlter
saccades and also as the ﬁne-tuning criterion in the second stage HMM, and the
position features are used as the main feature to separate ﬁxations and smooth
pursuits in the second stage classiﬁcation.

We present the visualization results of the data features on the subject that is
manually evaluated as ”good” in [13] using the K-Means cluster algorithm. The
main objective of the pre-processing is to select appropriate features for further
classiﬁcations using HMM. In the meanwhile, it also provides some insights for
the reasons why the classic threshold-based methods may fail to achieve good

performance in the ternary eye movement classiﬁcation task. As shown in Fig. 2,
the actual eye tracking data usually contain a lot of noises. Take the velocity
feature as an example, there exist some noisy data points with extremely large
velocities and the diﬀerence of velocity among ﬁxations, saccades and smooth
pursuits are not very clear. Therefore, the statistical methods with predeﬁned
threshold values are more likely to fail in this case.
Ablation Study Analysis. We conduct an additional ablation experiment to
demonstrate the necessity and eﬀectiveness of the proposed hierarchical struc-
ture. Since the ﬁxations, saccades and smooth pursuits in the ternary eye move-
ment classiﬁcation can be considered as three hidden states of an HMM, we use
the velocity feature as the criterion and adopt a single-stage HMM with the
three-hidden state to do the same task, in other words, we remove the second
stage classiﬁcation from the proposed method.

The quantitative and qualitative results are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3, re-
spectively. Both experimental results prove that the hierarchical structure con-
tributes to better classiﬁcation results. The qualitative ﬁgure shows that the
hierarchical structure helps especially with the separation between ﬁxations and
smooth pursuits, which further validates the fact that the velocity feature is

tive results.

biased for ﬁxations and smooth pursuits. Therefore, the analysis of diﬀerent fea-
tures and the usage of position features in the second stage of the proposed
method are necessary and beneﬁcial.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical HMM algorithm to tackle the problem of
ternary eye movement classiﬁcation from the raw eye positional data. Diﬀerent
features from the data are considered to realize the multi-stage hierarchical clas-
siﬁcation. Experiments on multiple data records demonstrate the eﬀectiveness
and robustness of the proposed method. Possible future directions of this work
could be incorporating the pre-processing step into the proposed method in an
automated way, and making eﬀorts to classify more categories of eye movements
with a deeper hierarchical structure.
