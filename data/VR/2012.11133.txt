Abstract V0842 Cep is a W UMa-type binary star that has been neglected since its discovery.

We analysed the VRcIc light curves, obtained by the 1 m telescope at the Weihai Observatory

of Shandong University, using the Wilson-Devinney code. V0842 Cep was found to be a

shallow contact binary system (f=8.7%) with a mass ratio of 2.281. Because its orbital in-
clination is greater than 80◦, the photometric results are reliable. A period study is included
dp
dt =1.50(±0.42)×10−7dyr−1). This

which reveals a continually decreasing orbital period (

trend could be attributed to the angular momentum loss via stellar wind.

1 INTRODUCTION

W UMa-type binary systems (contact binaries) usually contain two main sequence stars whose spectral

types vary from F to K. There is a common convective envelope that encases both stars. The orbital periods

of these systems are generally less than a day. In the past ﬁfty years, many researchers have investigated

these types of binaries (e.g., Hilditch 1989; Stepien 2006; Zhang et al. 2011; Qian et al. 2013a, 2014, 2017);

however, there are still a few questions regarding their structures and evolution, such as short-period cutoff

(e.g., Rucinski 1992; Jiang et al. 2012; Li et al. 2019, 2020); and lower mass-ratio limit(e.g., Webbink 1976;

Yang and Qian 2015; Kjurkchieva et al. 2018, 2020); Therefore, W UMa-type binaries should be further

investigated.

V0842 Cep is a typical W UMa-type eclipsing binary, which exhibits continuous light variation, and the

depths of two light minima are similar. The orbital period of V0842 Cep (GSC 04586-01412,V=14.7mag)

is 0.288957 days,making it a very short period system (VSP). The object was discovered by Kuzmin (2007)

and conﬁrmed by ASAS-SN1 (Shappee et al. 2014; Jayasinghe et al. 2019). Jayasinghe et al. (2019) found

that this object is an EW-type binary with V magnitude of 14.34 mag, amplitude of 0.67 mag, and period

of 0.288954 days. Using the observations of VRcIc charge-coupled device (CCD) light curves, we include

here a complete synthetic light curve analysis and period study.

2 OBSERVATION

V0842 Cep was observed using the 1 m telescope at Weihai Observatory, Shandong University (Hu et al.

2014) on October 24, 2018. To this end, the PIXIS 2048B CCD camera was also employed; the camera has

a format of 2048 × 2048 pixels, revealing a 12

×12

ﬁeld of view. The Johnson–Cousin–Bessel VRcIc data

were derived using the CCD photometric system. The typical exposure time is 100 s for the V band, 45 s

for the R band, and 25 s for the I band.

The data were reduced using C-Munipack2 including bias and ﬂat correction. We then used an aper-

ture photometry method to measure instrumental magnitudes. Figure 1 shows one of the processed images,

where the variable star (i.e., V0842 Cep), comparison star, and check star are denoted as ”V”, ”C”, and

”CH”, respectively. The photometric results of the three bands as well as the difference in the magni-

tudes of the comparison and check stars are shown in Figure 2. Two light minima were determined as

2458415.99495(±0.00056) and 2458416.13833(±0.00054).

3 PHOTOMETRIC SOLUTIONS

We analysed the VRcIc light curves via the W-D code (Wilson & Devinney 1971; Wilson 1990, 1994).

First, we determined stellar effective temperature 4920 K from Gaia DR2 database3 (Gaia Collaboration

et al. 2016, 2018), and noticed that its typical accuracy is 324K (Andrae et al. 2018). Preliminary solutions

demonstrate that the luminosity of the secondary star is greater than that of the primary star; therefore,

user interfaces and command line models.

we set the stellar effective temperature as the temperature of the secondary star. V0842 Cep is a late-type

binary star; thus, a few parameters can be ﬁxed to match the corresponding convective envelope, such as the

gravity-darkening coefﬁcients (g1 =g2 =0.32) (Lucy 1967) and bolometric albedo (A1 = A2 = 0.5) (Rucinski

1969). Bolometric and bandpass limb-darkening coefﬁcients can be obtained from Van Hamme (1993).

Evidently, the three-bandpass light curves are EW-type, indicating that V0842 Cep is a contact binary

system. Therefore, we selected mode 3 during our modelling. There are a few adjustable parameters, such

as the monochromatic luminosity of the primary component (L1V , L1R and L1I ), orbital inclination (i),

effective temperature of the primary component (T1), and potentials of two components (Ω1 =Ω2).

We determined the mass ratio of V0842 Cep via a q-search method. We plotted the relation between

mass ratio q and the weighted sum of the squared residuals ΣWi(O-C)i in Figure 3 to obtain the most

reliable mass ratio. When q is 2.4, the Σ can be employed to derive the minimum value. Therefore, we set

q = 2.4 as an initial value and ensured that it could be varied. Then, the results were derived. Photometric

solutions are summarised in Table 1 and the corresponding theoretical light curves are illustrated in Figure

4.

4 ORBITAL PERIOD INVESTIGATIONS

In addition to the results calculated using our own data and AAVSO4 , the light minimum times can also be

obtained from the O-C Gateway5 and relevant references.

There are a total of 8 times of light minimum, and the corresponding O-C values were calculated by a

linear ephemeris:

The O-C curve can be ﬁtted to represent the dotted line in Figure 5; however, it cannot completely describe

the variation trend. Therefore, we used the least-squares method and found a good ﬁt by adding a quadratic

term:

M in.I = 2456908.37367(±0.00295) + 0.28895094(±0.000000432171) × E

(2)

+ −5.95(±1.65) × 10−11E2.

Based on the quadratic term, we could calculate the period decrease rate: dp

dt =1.50(±0.42)×10−7dyr−1.
The ﬁtting curve is plotted and illustrated as the solid line in Figure 5 further, the corresponding residuals

are presented in the bottom of Figure 5. The details of each data point are listed in Table 2.

5 DISCUSSION

The VRcIc light curves were analysed via the W-D program. This is the ﬁrst to determine the photometric

solutions of V0842 Cep. The solutions indicate that V0842 Cep is a W-type shallow contact binary with a

mass ratio of 2.281 and contact degree of 8.7%. And its orbital inclination is more than 80 degrees, which

means the photometric solution results are quite reliable (Pribulla et al. 2003; Terrell & Wilson 2005). Since

there are no spectroscopic observations of this star, absolute parameters cannot be uniquely determined. If

the more massive component is a normal, main sequence star, its estimated mass is 0.76M⊙ according to

the effective temperature 4920 K (Cox 2000). The mass of the less massive component can be calculated as

follows: q=M2/M1. The result obtained is 0.33M⊙. Other absolute parameters are a=1.89R⊙, R1=0.59R⊙,

R2=0.87R⊙, L1=0.23L⊙, and L2=0.40L⊙.

According to the colour index obtained from APASS-DR96 and interstellar reddening coefﬁcient mea-

sured by Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011), the (B-V)0 can be determined as 0.6238. Using the following equa-

tion proposed by Rucinski & Duerbeck (1997), the absolute magnitude was calculated to be MV = 4.40

6 The AAVSO Photometric All Sky Survey (APASS) project is designed to bridge the gap between the shallow Tycho2 two-

bandpass photometric catalogue that is complete to V=11 and the deeper (Henden et al. 2016).

MV = −4.44logP + 3.02(B − V )0 + 0.12,

(3)

According to Samus et al. (2017), the V band magnitude under maximum light can be determined to be

mV = 14 mag; further, after considering interstellar extinction, the revised value can be calculated as 12.80

mag (Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011). The distance module can then be determined as mV - MV =8.40 mag,

and the corresponding distance can be estimated to be 478.63 pc, which is similar to the distance derived

by Gaia DR2, 485.12 pc.

To estimate the evolutionary status of V0842 Cep, both the components of V0842 Cep are denoted on

the mass-luminosity diagram in Figure 6. We constructed Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) and Terminal

Age Main Sequence (TAMS) lines using the binary star evolution code provided by Hurley et al. (2002).

Simultaneously, the parameters of 42 W-type binaries, obtained by Yakut & Eggleton (2005), are indicated

for comparison. The primary star of the object is located above the TAMS, implying that the primary star

has evolved out of the main sequence and is over-luminous and over-sized. In contrast, the secondary star

of the object lies between the ZAMS and the TAMS, indicating that it is an evolved main sequence star.

V0842 Cep exhibits an evolutionary status similar to those of other W-type binaries.

According to the 8 minimum light times, we did the period analysis for the ﬁrst time. The downward

loss via magnetic stellar wind. By the decreasing orbital period, we can estimate that the shallow contact

binary system will evolve into a deep contact binary system in the future.

V0842 Cep is a K-type binary. Thus, a few K-type contact binaries have been listed and compared in

Table 3. We statistically determined that K-type binaries have a few common features. First, temperature of

the more massive component is lower than that of the primary component for all these systems, indicating

that most of the K-type contact binaries are W-subtype systems. Second, most systems are shallow contact

binaries(f≤25%), corresponding to the character of W-subtype contact binaries. Third, the periods of these

systems are fairly short (less than 0.3 days), which can be satisﬁed with the period–colour relation (Rucinski

1998).

V0842 Cep is worthy of further investigation. More spectroscopic and photometric observations are

required for determining the precise mass ratio and orbital period variation of binary stars.
