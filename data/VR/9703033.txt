Due to the noncommutative nature of quaternions and octonions we introduce barred operators.
This objects give the opportunity to manipulate appropriately the hypercomplex ﬁelds. The stan-
dard problems arising in the deﬁnitions of transpose, determinant and trace for quaternionic and
octonionic matrices are immediately overcome. We also investigate the possibility to formulate a
new approach to Hypercomplex Group Theory (HGT). From a mathematical viewpoint, our aim is
to highlight the possibility of looking at new hypercomplex groups by the use of barred operators
as fundamental step toward a clear and complete discussion of HGT.

I. INTRODUCTION

Complex numbers have played a dual role in Physics, ﬁrst as a technical tool in resolving diﬀerential equation
(e.g. in classical optics) or via the theory of analytic functions for performing real integrations, summing series, etc.;
secondly in a more essential way in the development of Quantum Mechanics (and later Field Theory) characterized
by complex wave functions and for fermions by complex wave equations. With quaternions, for the ﬁrst type of
application, i.e. as a means to simplify calculations, we can quote the original work of Hamilton [1], but this only
because of the late development of vector algebra by Gibbs and Heaviside [2]. Even Maxwell used quaternions as a
tool in his calculations, e.g. in the Treatise of Electricity and Magnetism [3] we ﬁnd the ∇-operator expressed by the
three quaternionic imaginary units.

Notwithstanding the Hamilton’s conviction that quaternions would soon play a role comparable to, if not greater
than, that of complex numbers the use of quaternions in Physics was very limited [4]. Nevertheless, in the last decades,
we ﬁnd a renewed interest in the application of noncommutative ﬁelds in Mathematics and Physics. In Physics, we
quote quaternionic versions of Gauge Theories [5–8], Quantum Mechanics and Fields [9–14], Special Relativity [15]. In
Mathematics, we ﬁnd applications of quaternions for Tensor Products [16,17], Group Representations [18]. Nonassocia-
tive numbers are diﬃcult to manipulate, nevertheless, the use of the octonionic ﬁeld within Quantum Mechanics [19],
in particular in a formulation the Dirac Equation [20], and in Group Theory [21] has recently appeared.

In this paper we aim to give a new panoramic review of hypercomplex groups. We use the adjective “new” since

the elements of our matrices will not be simple quaternions or octonions but barred hypercomplex operators.

In Physics, particularly Quantum Mechanics, we are accustomed to distinguishing between “states” and “operators”.
Even when the operators are represented by numerical matrices, the squared form of operators distinguishes them
from the column structure of the spinors states. Only for one-component ﬁelds and operators is there potential
confusion. In extending Quantum Mechanics deﬁned over the complex ﬁeld to quaternions or even octonions, it has
almost always been assumed that matrix operators contain elements which are “numbers” indistinguishable from
those of the state vectors. This is an unjustiﬁed limitation. In fact, (noncommutative) hypercomplex theories require
barred operators [22].

This paper is organized as follows:

In
section III, we show that the noncommutative nature of the quaternionic and octonionic ﬁelds suggest the use of
barred operators. We also give a brief review on the recent applications of barred operators in Mathematics and
Physics. In section IV and V, we ﬁnd the appropriate deﬁnitions of transpose, trace and determinant for quaternionic
and octonionic matrices. Such sections also contain the new classiﬁcation of hypercomplex groups. Our conclusions
are drawn in the ﬁnal section.

In section II, we introduce the quaternionic and octonionic algebras.

II. HYPERCOMPLEX ALGEBRAS

Complex numbers can be constructed from the real numbers by introducing a quantity e1 whose square is −1:

c = r1 + e1r2

(r1,2 ∈ R) .

Likewise, we can construct the quaternions from the complex numbers in exactly the same way by introducing another
quantity e2 whose squared is −1,

q = c1 + e2c2

(c1,2 ∈ C) ,

and which anticommutes with e1 (e1e2 = −e2e1 = e3). We wish to emphasize the need of three anticommuting
imaginary units in constructing the quaternionic ﬁeld (only two imaginary units are not suﬃcient to obtain Hamilton’s
ﬁeld).

In introducing the quaternionic algebra, let us follow the conceptual approach of Hamilton.

In 1843, the Irish
mathematician attempted to generalize the complex ﬁeld in order to describe the rotations in the three-dimensional
space. He began by looking for numbers of the form

x + e1y + e2z ,

1 = e2

with e2
Inﬂuenced by the existence of a complex number norm

2 = −1. Hamilton’s hope was to do for three-dimensional space what complex numbers do for the plane.

when he looked at its generalization

c∗c = (Re c)2 + (Im c)2 ,

(x − e1y − e2z)(x + e1y + e2z) = x2 + y2 + z2 − (e1e2 + e2e1)yz ,

to obtain a real number, he had to adopt the anticommutative law of multiplication for the imaginary units. Never-
theless, as remarked before, with only two imaginary units we have no chance of constructing a new numerical ﬁeld,
because assuming

e1e2 = α0 + e1α1 + e2α2
e2e1 = β0 + e1β1 + e2β2

(α0,1,2 ∈ R) ,
(β0,1,2 ∈ R) ,

and

we ﬁnd the relation

e1e2 = −e2e1 ,

α0,1,2 = β0,1,2 = 0 .

Thus, we must introduce a third imaginary unit e3 6= e1,2, with

e3 = e1e2 = −e2e1 .

This noncommutative ﬁeld is therefore characterized by three imaginary units e1, e2, e3 which satisfy the following
multiplication rules

1 = e2
e2

2 = e2

3 = e1e2e3 = −1 .

Numbers of the form

q = x0 + e1x + e2y + e3z

( x0, x, y, z ∈ R ) ,

(1)

(2)

are called (real) quaternions. They are added, subtracted and multiplied according to the usual laws of arithmetic,
except for the commutative law of multiplication.

2

Similarly to rotations in a plane that can be concisely expressed by complex number, a rotation about an axis
passing through the origin and parallel to a given unitary vector ˆu ≡ (ux, uy, uz) by an angle α can be obtained taking
the following quaternionic transformation

~e · ~u

~e · ~r exp

−

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

α
2

~e · ~u

,

(cid:17)

where ~e ≡ (e1, e2, e3) and ~r ≡ (x, y, z). In section III, we shall see how the quaternionic number q in Eq. (2), with the
identiﬁcation x0 ≡ ct, can be used to formulate a one-dimensional version of the Lorentz group [15]. This gives the
natural generalization of Hamilton’s idea

complex/plane → pure imaginary quaternions/space → quaternions/space-time ,

completing the uniﬁcation of algebra and geometry.

Let us now consider the conjugate of q

q† = x0 − e1x − e2y − e3z .

(3)

We observe that q†q and qq† are both equal to the real number

N (q) = x2

0 + x2 + y2 + z2 ,

which is called the norm of q. When q 6= 0, we can deﬁne

q−1 = q†/N (q) ,

so the quaternions form a zero-division ring. Such a noncommutative number ﬁeld is denoted, in Hamilton honour,
by H.

An important diﬀerence between quaternionic and complex numbers is related to the deﬁnition of the conjugation

operation. Whereas with complex numbers we can deﬁne only one type of conjugation

working with quaternionic numbers we can introduce diﬀerent conjugation operations. Indeed, with three imaginary
units we have the possibility to deﬁne besides the standard conjugation (3), the six new operations

e1 → −e1 ,

(e1, e2, e3) → (−e1, +e2, +e3) , (+e1, −e2, +e3) , (+e1, +e2, −e3) ;
(e1, e2, e3) → (+e1, −e2, −e3) , (−e1, +e2, −e3) , (−e1, −e2, +e3) .

These last six conjugations can be concisely represented by q and q† as follows

q → −e1q†e1 , − e2q†e2 , − e3q†e3 ,
q → −e1qe1 , − e2qe2 , − e3qe3 .

It could seem that the only independent conjugation be represented by q†. Nevertheless, q† can also be expressed in
terms of q, in fact

q† = −

1
2

(q + e1qe1 + e2qe2 + e3qe3) .

(4)

In going from the complex numbers to the quaternions we lose the property of commutativity (e.g. e1e2 = −e2e1).
In going from the quaternions to the next more complicated division algebra, we also lose the property of associa-
tivity. Octonionic numbers can be constructed from the quaternions by introducing a new imaginary unit e4 which
anticommutes with the quaternionic imaginary units e1, e2 and e3,

o = q1 + e4q2

(q1,2 ∈ H) .

We can immediately show the nonassociativity of the octonionic numbers in the previous “split” representation. In
fact, by starting from the seven imaginary units

e1, e2, e3, e4 , e5 = e1e4, e6 = e2e4, e7 = e3e4 ,

3

it is straightforward to verify that

in fact imposing associativity we have for example

e5e6e3 = e6e7e1 = e7e5e2 = −1 ,

Associativity fails in the following relations

e5e6e3 = e1e4e2e4e3 = −e1e2e2

4e3 = e1e2e3 = −1 .

e1(e4e3) = −e1e7 = e6

and

(e1e4)e3 = e5e3 = −e6 .

We now summarize our notation for the octonionic algebra and introduce useful elementary properties to manipulate

the nonassociative numbers. An octonionic number will be represented by

7

o = r0 +

rmem

( r0,...,7 reals ) ,

Xm=1

where em are elements obeying the noncommutative and nonassociative algebra

emen = −δmn + ǫmnpep

( m, n, p = 1, ..., 7 ) ,

with ǫmnp totally antisymmetric and equal to unity for the seven combinations

123, 145, 176, 246, 257, 347 and 365

(5)

(6)

(each cycle represents a quaternionic subalgebra). Amongst the diﬀerent (equivalent) possibilities, we choose the
previous combinations to uniform the notation of this paper with the notation which appears in recent works [19–21].

The norm, N (o), for the octonions is deﬁned by

with the octonionic conjugate o† given by

N (o) = (o†o)

1

2 = (oo†)

2 = (r2

0 + ... + r2
7)

1
2 ,

The inverse is then

7

o† = r0 −

rmem .

Xm=1

o−1 = o†/N (o)

( o 6= 0 ) .

We can deﬁne an associator (analogous to the usual algebraic commutator) as follows

{x, y, z} ≡ (xy)z − x(yz) ,

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

where, in each term on the right-hand, we must, ﬁrst of all, perform the multiplication in brackets. Note that for real,
complex and quaternionic numbers the associator is trivially null. For octonionic imaginary units we have

{em, en, ep} ≡ (emen)ep − em(enep) = 2ǫmnpses ,

(11)

with ǫmnps totally antisymmetric and equal to unity for the seven combinations

1247, 1265, 2345, 2376, 3146, 3157 and 4576 .

Working with octonionic numbers the associator (10) is in general non-vanishing, however, an “alternative condition”
is fulﬁlled

{x, y, z} + {z, y, x} = 0 .

III. BARRED OPERATORS

Due to the noncommutative nature of quaternions we must distinguish between q1q2 and q2q1. Thus, it is appropriate
to consider left/right-actions for our imaginary units e1, e2 and e3. We introduce barred operators [22] to represent,
in a compact way, the right-action of the three quaternionic imaginary units. Explicitly, we write

to identify the right multiplication of e1, e2, e3 and so

1 | e1 , 1 | e2 , 1 | e3

(1 | em)q ≡ qem

(m = 1, 2, 3) .

In this formalism, the most general transformation on quaternions will be given by

q0 + q1 | e1 + q2 | e2 + q3 | e3

(q0,1,2,3 ∈ H) .

(13)

(14)

In the last few years the left/right-action of the quaternionic numbers, expressed by barred operators (14), has been
very useful in overcoming diﬃculties owing to the noncommutativity of quaternions. Among the successful applications
of barred operators we mention the one-dimensional quaternionic formulation of Lorentz boosts. Explicitly, the
quaternionic generators of the Lorentz group are

boost (ct, x)
boost (ct, y)
boost (ct, z)
rotation around x
rotation around y
rotation around z

e2|e1−e1|e2
2
e1−1|e1

e2−1|e2

,

.

The four real quantities which identify the space-time point (ct, x, y, z) are represented by the quaternion

q = ct + e1x + e2y + e3z .

We know that in analogy to the connection between the rotation group O(3) and the special unitary group SU (2),
there is a natural correspondence between the Lorentz group O(3, 1) and the special linear group SL(2). The use
of barred operators (14) gives us the possibility to extend the connection between the special unitary group SU (2)
and the unitary quaternions by allowing a one-dimensional quaternionic version of the special linear group SL(2)
(a detailed discussion is found in ref. [15]). We also note that barred operators (14) have 16 real parameters, the
same number of parameters which appear in 4 × 4 real matrices. This suggests a correspondence between such barred
quaternionic operators and generic 4-dimensional real matrices (appendix A).

New possibilities, coming out from the use of barred operators, also appear in Quantum Mechanics and Field
Theory, e.g. they allow an appropriate deﬁnition of the momentum operator [12], quaternionic version of standard
relativistic equations [12,13], Lagrangian formalism [23], electroweak model [7] and grand uniﬁcation theories [8].

Let us now discuss the algebra of barred operators and introduce some elementary relations and deﬁnitions which
will be useful in the following sections. Remembering the noncommutativity of the quaternionic multiplication, we
must specify if our scalar factors are quaternionic, complex or real numbers. Operators which act on states only from
the left (i.e. quaternionic numbers) will be named quaternionic linear operator and will be simply indicated by q.
Obviously, from these more general classes of operators, such as complex or real linear quaternionic operators, can be
constructed. For example, the barred operator (14) represents a real linear quaternionic operator. It will be denoted
by Qr,

To complete the list of possible barred operators we give an explicit example of complex linear quaternionic operator

Qr = q0 + q1 | e1 + q2 | e2 + q3 | e3 .

In this section, we shall deal with the algebra of real linear quaternionic operators

Qc ≡ q0 + q1 | e1 .

Qr ⊃ Qc ⊃ q .

5

Our considerations and conclusions can be immediately translated to complex linear quaternionic operator.
The product of two barred operators Qr and Pr in terms of quaternions q0,1,2,3 and p0,1,2,3 is given by

QrPr = q0p0 − q1p1 − q2p2 − q3p3 +

(q0p1 + q1p0 − q2p3 + q3p2) | e1 +
(q0p2 + q2p0 − q3p1 + q1p3) | e2 +
(q0p3 + q3p0 − q1p2 + q2p1) | e3 .

The “full” conjugation operation is deﬁned by changing the sign of our left/right quaternionic imaginary units, i.e.

(e1, e2, e3)† = −(e1, e2, e3)

and

(1 | e1, 1 | e2, 1 | e3)† = −(1 | e1, 1 | e2, 1 | e3) .

The previous deﬁnition implies

and so

1q†
[(q1 | q2)(p1 | p2)]† = (q1p1 | p2q2)† = p†
= (p1 | p2)†(q1 | q2)† ,

1 | q†

2p†

2

(QrPr)† = P †

r Q†

r .

In section IV, dealing with quaternionic matrices we shall distinguish between real linear quaternionic groups,
GL(n, Qr), and complex linear quaternionic groups, GL(n, Qc). For a clear and complete discussion of standard
quaternionic groups, GL(n, q), the reader is referred to Gilmore’s book [24]. The use of barred operators give new
opportunities in HGT. Let us observe as follows. The so-called “symplectic” complex representation of a quaternion
(state) q

by a complex column matrix, is

q = c1 + e2c2

(c1,2 ∈ C) ,

q ↔

c1
c2 (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

The operator representation of e1, e2 and e3 consistent with the above identiﬁcation

e1 ↔

(15)

(16)

has been known since the discovery of quaternions. It permits any quaternionic number or matrix to be translated
into a complex matrix, but not necessarily viceversa. Eight real numbers are required to deﬁne the most general
2 × 2 complex matrix but only four are needed to deﬁne the most general quaternion. In fact since every (non-zero)
quaternion has an inverse, only a subclass of invertible 2 × 2 complex matrices are identiﬁable with quaternions.
Complex linear quaternionic operators complete the translation [22]. The barred quaternionic imaginary unit

1 | e1 ↔

i 0
0 i (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

adds four additional degrees of freedom, obtained by matrix multiplication of the corresponding matrices,

1 | e1 , e1 | e1 , e2 | e1 , e3 | e1 ,

and so we have a set of rules for translating from any 2 × 2 complex matrices to Qc-barred operators. This opens
new possibilities for quaternionic numbers, see for example the one-dimensional version of the Glashow group [7].
Obviously this translation does not apply to odd-dimensional complex matrices [25].

We conclude this section by extending our considerations on barred operators to the octonionic ﬁeld. Here, the
situation is more delicate. Due to the nonassociativity of octonions we must distinguish between left and right barred
operator. The natural octonionic extension of (14) should be

6

7

o0 +

om | em

(o0,...,7 octonions) ,

(17)

Xm=1

but, due to the nonassociativity, this operator is not a well deﬁned object. For example, the triple product o1oe1
could be either (o1o)e1 or o1(oe1). So, in order to avoid ambiguities, we need to deﬁne left/right-barred operators.
Left barred operators will be indicated by

o1 ) e1 + o2 ) e2 + ... + o7 ) e7 ,

in similar way we introduce right barred operators

Their action on a generic quaternionic number o is respectively represented by

o1 ( e1 + o2 ( e2 + ... + o7 ( e7 .

and

(o1o)e1 + (o2o)e2 + ... + (o7o)e7 ,

o1(oe1) + o2(oe2) + ... + o7(oe7) .

Nevertheless, there are barred operators in which the nonassociativity does not apply, like

or

1 ) em = 1 ( em ≡ 1 | em ,

em ) em = em ( em ≡ em | em .

The counting of independent barred operators should be 106, explicitly

1, em, 1 | em
em | em
em ) en
em ( en
m = 1, 2, ..., 7

(m 6= n)
(m 6= n)

(15 elements) ,
(7) ,
(42) ,
(42) ,

Yet, we can prove that each right-barred operator can be expressed by a suitable combination of left-barred operators.
The proof is based on the correspondence between the left-right barred octonionic operators and generic 8 × 8 real
matrices [21]. In appendix B, we report, for the sake of completeness, the translation rules between octonionic left-
right barred operators and 8 × 8 real matrices. Thus, to represent the most general octonionic operator, we need only
left-barred objects

reducing to 64 the previous 106 elements. Barred operators (18), which will be denoted by Or, represent real linear
octonionic operators. From these, we can immediately extract complex linear octonionic operator, Oc, and obviously
the standard octonionic linear operators, o,

The classiﬁcation of octonionic/quaternionic operator, given in this section, can be concisely summarized as follows

IV. QUATERNIONIC GROUPS

Every set of basis vectors in Vn can be related to every other coordinate system by an n × n non singular matrix.
The n × n matrix groups involved in changing bases in the vector spaces Rn, Cn and Hn are called general linear
groups of n × n matrices over the reals, complex and quaternions

GL(n, r)

→

GL(n, c)

→

GL(n, q)
↓
GL(n, Qc)
↓
GL(n, Qr) .

Before discussing the groups GL(n, Qr) and GL(n, Qc), we introduce a new deﬁnition of transpose for quaternionic
matrices which will allow us to overcome the diﬃculties due to the noncommutative nature of the quaternionic ﬁeld
(our deﬁnition, applying to standard quaternions, will be extended to complex and real linear quaternions).

The customary convention of deﬁning the transpose M t of the matrix M is

In general, however, for two quaternionic matrices M and N one has

(M N )t 6= N tM t ,

(M t)rs = Msr .

whereas this statement hold as an equality for complex matrices. For example, the matrices

m1 m2
m3 m4 (cid:19) (cid:18)

n1 n2
n3 n4 (cid:19)(cid:21)

(cid:20)(cid:18)

(19)

(20)

are equal only if we use a commutative number ﬁeld. How can we deﬁne orthogonal quaternionic groups? By looking
at the previous example, we see that the problem arises in the diﬀerent position of factors m1,2,3,4 and n1,2,3,4 in the
elements of our matrices. The solution is very simple once seen. It is possible to give a quaternionic transpose which
reverses the order of factors and goes back to the usual deﬁnition for complex numbers, ct = c. We deﬁne

qt = x0 + e1x1 − e2x2 + e3x3 .

(21)

In this way, the transpose of a product of two quaternions q and p is the product of the transpose quaternions in
reverse order

(qp)t = ptqt .

The proof is straightforward if we recognize the following relation between transpose qt and conjugate q†,

Thus, in the quaternionic world the convention of deﬁning the transpose M t of the matrix M will be

qt = −e2q†e2 .

or equivalently

where M † is deﬁned in the standard way as

(M t)rs = M t
sr

,

M t = −e2M †e2 ,

(M †)rs = M †
sr

.

With this new deﬁnition of quaternionic transpose, the relation

8

(22)

(M N )t = −e2(M N )†e2 = −e2N †M †e2
= (−e2N †e2)(−e2M †e2)
= N tM t

also holds for noncommutative numbers.

Noting that under the transpose operation we have et

1,3 = e1,3 and et

2 = −e2, we can immediately generalize the

deﬁnition of transpose conjugation to complex and real linear quaternionic operators

is again preserved.

In discussing the classiﬁcation of the classical (matrix) groups, it is necessary to introduce one additional concept:
the metric. A metric function on a vector space is a mapping of a pair of vectors into a number ﬁeld F (F ≡ R/C for
real/complex linear operators, see below). Let us now recall the following theorem: The subset of transformations of
basis in Vn which preserves the mathematical structure of a metric forms a subgroup of general linear groups.

bilinear antisymmetric metrics are called
sesquilinear symmetric

The previous theorem is valid for all real and complex metric-preserving matrix groups. It is also valid for quaternionic
groups that preserve sesquilinear metrics, since two quaternions obey (q1q2)† = q†
1. It is not true for quaternionic
matrices and bilinear metrics, since two quaternions do not generally commute. Nevertheless, it is still possible
to associate subgroups of GL(n, q) with groups that preserve bilinear metrics.
In the literature this is done in
the following way. “Each quaternion in GL(n, q) is replaced by the corresponding 2 × 2 complex matrix using the
translation rules (16). The subset of matrices in this complex 2n × 2n matrix representation of GL(n, q) that leaves
invariant a bilinear metric forms a group, since the theorem is valid for bilinear metrics on complex linear vector
spaces. We can associate an n × n quaternion-valued matrix with each 2n × 2n complex-valued matrix in the resulting
groups that preserve bilinear metrics in the space C2n, which is a representation for the space Hn” - Gilmore [24].

2q†

Once we write our complex matrix, we can trivially obtain the generators of complex orthogonal groups in a
standard manner and then we can translate back into quaternionic language. But this is surely a laborious procedure.
Deﬁning an appropriate transpose for quaternionic numbers (21), we can overcome the just-cited diﬃculty. Besides,
using the symplectic representation (15), the most general transformation (on quaternionic states) will be necessarily
represented by complex linear quaternionic operators, Qc, and for the invariant metric we have to require a “complex”
projection

(qtq)c = [(c1 − e2c∗

2)(c1 + e2c2)]c = c2

1 + c2

2 .

We wish to emphasize that the introduction of the imaginary unit 1 | e1 in complex linear quaternionic operators

(1 | e1)† = −1 | e1 ,

necessarily implies a complex inner product. The “new” imaginary units 1 | e1 represents an antihermitian operator,
and so it must verify

e2 ,
e2 , e2 | e1 ,
e2 , e1 | e2 , e3 | e2 , 1 | e2 , e2 | e1 , e2 | e3 .

At this point, we make a number of observations:

1.

- The diﬀerence between orthogonal and unitary groups is manifest for complex linear quaternionic groups

because of the diﬀerent numbers of generators.

2. - Orthogonal and unitary real linear quaternionic groups have the same number of generators.
3. - The groups U (n+, n−, r) and O(n+, n−, r) are identical (there is no diﬀerence between bilinear and sesquilinear

metrics in a real vector space) and this suggest a possible link between U (n, Qr) and O(n, Qr).

4.

- For real linear quaternionic groups, the invariant metric requires a “real” projection (note that 1 | e1,2,3

represent antihermitian operators only for real inner products).
Let us show the “real” invariant metric for U (1, Qr) and O(1, Qr),

(q†q)r = [(x0 − e1x1 − e2x2 − e3x3)(x0 + e1x1 + e2x2 + e3x3)]r = x2
(qtq)r = [(x0 + e1x1 − e2x2 + e3x3)(x0 + e1x1 + e2x2 + e3x3)]r = x2

0 + x2
0 − x2

1 + x2
1 + x2

2 + x2
3 ,
2 − x2
3 .

We can immediately recognize the invariant metric of O(4, r) and O(2, 2, r). To complete the analogy between one-
dimensional real linear quaternionic operators and 4-dimensional real matrices, we observe that besides the subgroups
related to the †-conjugation (where the sign of all three imaginary units is changed) and the t-conjugation (where
only e2 → −e2), we can deﬁne a new subgroup which leaves invariant the following real metric

where

Explicitly,

(q†gq)r ,

g = −

1
2

(1 + e1 | e1 + e2 | e2 + e3 | e3) .

(q†gq)r = [(x0 − e1x1 − e2x2 − e3x3)(x0 − e1x1 − e2x2 − e3x3)]r = x2

0 − x2

1 − x2

2 − x2
3 .

So the new subgroup, ˜O(1, Qr), represents the one-dimensional quaternionic counterpart of the Lorentz group [15].
We observe that the ∗-conjugation, obtained by changing the sing of two imaginary units,

10

also gives a real invariant metric related to O(3, 1, r)

q∗ = x0 − e1x1 − e2x2 + e3x3 ,

(q∗q)r = [(x0 − e1x1 − e2x2 + e3x3)(x0 + e1x1 + e2x2 + e3x3)]r = x2

0 + x2

1 + x2

2 − x2

3 .

Nevertheless, it is not suitable in deﬁning a new subgroup because

(qp)∗ = q∗p∗ .

The classical groups which occupy a central place in group representation theory and have many applications in
various branches of Mathematics and Physics are the unitary, special unitary, orthogonal, and symplectic groups. In
order to deﬁne special groups, we must deﬁne an appropriate trace for our matrices. In fact, for noncommutative
numbers the trace of the product of two numbers is not the trace of the product with reversed factors. With complex
linear quaternions we have the possibility to give a new deﬁnition of “complex” trace (T r) by

T r Qc = Re q0 + e1 Re q1 .

Such a deﬁnition implies that for any two complex linear quaternionic operators Qc and Pc

For real linear quaternions we need to use the standard deﬁnition of “real” trace (tr)

T r (QcPc) = T r (PcQc) .

since the previous “complex” deﬁnition (23) gives

tr Qr = Re q0 ,

T r (QrPr) 6= T r (PrQr) .

Explicitly, we ﬁnd

T r (QrPr) = Re (q0p0 − q1p1 − q2p2 − q3p3) +

e1 Re (q0p1 + q1p0 − q2p3 + q3p2) ,

T r (PrQr) = Re (p0q0 − p1q1 − p2q2 − p3q3) +

e1 Re (p0q1 + p1q0 − p2q3 + p3q2) .

(23)

(24)

We recall that the generators of the unitary, special unitary, orthogonal groups must satisfy the following condi-

tions [26]

U (n)
SU (n)
O(n)

A + A† = 0 ,
A + A† = 0 ,
A + At = 0 .

T r A = 0 ,

These conditions also apply for quaternionic groups.

For complex symplectic groups we ﬁnd

where

Sp(2n)

J A + AtJ = 0 ,

J =

0n×n 1n×n
−1n×n 0n×n (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

Working with quaternionic numbers, we can construct a group preserving a non-singular antisymmetric metric, for n
odd as well as n even. Thus for quaternionic symplectic groups we have

Sp(n)

J A + AtJ = 0 ,

with

J2n×2n =

V. OCTONIONIC GROUPS

The introduction of real linear quaternionic barred operators, with their 16 real parameters, naturally suggests a
link between Qr and a generic 4 × 4 real matrix. Besides, complex linear quaternionic operators, Qc, are characterized
by four complex parameters, the same number of parameters which characterizes two-dimensional complex matrices.
If we try to repeat such a counting for real linear octonionic barred operators, due to the nonassociativity, we
ﬁnd 106 real parameters. Nevertheless, as remarked in section III, we can express right-barred operators by left-
barred operators reducing to 64 the previous counting. So, we don’t have apparently any problem in repeating the
considerations of section IV. Yet, for complex linear octonionic operators, this will not be so easy (the nonassociativity
of the octonionic ﬁeld gives some drawbacks).

Let us try to generalize the symplectic complex representation (15) of a quaternionic state to an octonionic state

by the complex matrix

o = c1 + e2c2 + e4c3 + e6c4

(c1,2,3,4 ∈ C) ,

c1
c2
c3
c4

.






o ↔ 



(25)

We immediately see that the barred quaternionic imaginary unit 1 | e1, when applied to an octonionic state, gives

(1 | e1) o = e1c1 + e2(e1c2) + e4(e1c3) + e6(e1c4) .

We don’t have problems with the nonassociativity of octonions because e1e2e3, e1e4e5, e1e7e6 form quaternionic
subalgebras and so the associativity is restored. Thus, the barred imaginary unit 1 | e1 can be identiﬁed with the
4-dimensional complex matrix i114×4. The only diﬀerence between quaternions and octonions is thus represented (as
expected) by the dimension of the complex matrix. In order to complete the translation we need to ﬁnd the octonionic

12

counterpart of (16). It is here that we have problems. Let us observe the following embarrassing situation. The action
of e2 on an octonionic state is

So we should have

e2o = e2c1 + e2(e2c2) + e2(e4c3) + e2(e6c4)

= −c2 + e2c1 − e4c∗

4 + e6c∗
3 .

e2o ↔ M(e2) 

c1
-c∗
4
c∗

.











?= 



Obviously we cannot ﬁnd a complex (left-acting) matrix M(e2) which corresponds to the octonionic imaginary unit
e2. We also note that the octonionic imaginary unit e2 does not represent an antihermitian operator, as desired to
generalize the quaternionic translation rules (16). In fact, for nonassociative numbers, we have

c (Aψ)†ϕ

R
c (e2ψ)†ϕ
↓
R
−

c (ψ†e2)ϕ

−

c ψ†(Aϕ)

c ψ†(e2ϕ) .
R

For complex linear octonionic operators e1 and 1 | e1 represent antihermitian imaginary units, whereas the remaining
e2,...,7 are not antihermitian operators. The proof is quoted in appendix C.

We wish to obtain the octonionic generalization of “e2”, which translates to

e2 ↔

0 -1
1 0 (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

(26)

when considered a quaternionic number and which obviously represents an antihermitian operator in the octonionic
world. The solution is

“e2” ≡ e2 +

e3 ) e1 − e3 ( e1

1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0





↔ 



(27)

Eq. (27) represents the octonionic counterpart of Eq. (26), and goes back to the usual deﬁnition for quaternionic
numbers, in fact

In a similar manner we can construct the octonionic counterpart of the quaternionic hermitian operator

e3 ) e1 − e3 ( e1
2

q ≡ 0 .

Explicitly,

e3 | e1 ↔

0 1
1 0 (cid:19)

In a previous paper [21] we discussed the link between GL(4, c) and complex linear octonionic operators. Never-
theless, in that paper we were not able to connect directly the 16 (complex) basis elements of GL(4, c) with complex
linear octonionic operators. “The 32 (real) basis elements of GL(4, c) can be extracted from the 64 generators of
GL(8, r)” [21]. We can now directly connect the antihermitian operators

In this way we can immediately recognize the antihermitian operators as generators of U (1, Oc), and so we obtain the
octonionic (one-dimensional) counterpart of U (4, c).

We conclude this section with some considerations concerning the octonionic groups.
1. - The nonassociativity is not a problem for real/complex octonionic operators because we have a correspondence

between such octonionic operators and (associative) general linear groups, GL(8, r)/GL(4, c).

2. - By our translation rules, we can immediately obtain the octonionic counterpart of GL(8n, r) and GL(4n, c).

Thus, we can translated a part of the standard real/complex groups.

3. - We must admit some technical diﬃculties in manipulating the octonionic ﬁeld, see for example the nonanti-

hermiticity (for complex linear operators) of the “standard” octonionic imaginary units e2,...,7.

4. - The considerations of section IV (transpose, trace, ...) can be extended to octonionic ﬁelds. For complex linear

octonionic operators, we must work with the new octonionic imaginary units “e2”, “e4”, “e6”, etc.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The more exciting possibility that quaternionic or octonionic equations will eventually play a signiﬁcant role in
Mathematics and Physics is synonymous, for some physicist, with the advent of a revolution in Physics comparable
to that of Quantum Mechanics.

For example, Adler suggested [28] that the color degree of freedom postulated in the Harari-Shupe model [29,30]
(where we can think of quarks and leptons as composites of other more fundamental fermions, preons) could be sought
in a noncommutative extension of the complex ﬁeld. Surely a stimulating idea. Nevertheless, we think that it would
be very strange if standard Quantum Mechanics did not permit a quaternionic or octonionic description other than
in the trivial sense that complex numbers are contained within the quaternions or octonions.

In the last few years much progress has been achieved in manipulating such ﬁelds. We quote the quaternionic
version of electroweak theory [7], where the Glashow group is expressed by the one-dimensional quaternionic group
U (1, q) | U (1, c), quaternionic GUTs [8] and Special Relativity, where the Lorentz group is represented by ˜O(1, Qr).
We also recall new possibilities related to the use of octonions in Quantum Mechanics [19], in particular in writing a
one-dimensional octonionic Dirac equation [20]. The link between octonionic and quaternionic versions of standard
Quantum Physics is represented by the use of a complex geometry [31].

In this paper we observe that beyond the study of matrix groups with “simple” quaternionic elements, q, one
can consider more general groups with matrix elements of the form Qr/c. To the best of our knowledge these more
general matrix groups have not been studied in the literature. We overcome the problems arising in the deﬁnitions of
transpose, determinant and trace for quaternionic matrices. For octonionic ﬁelds we must admit a more complicated
situation, yet our discussion can be also proposed for nonassociative numbers.

Finally, we hope that this paper emphasizes the possibility of using hypercomplex numbers in Mathematics and

Physics and it represents an important step towards a complete discussion of Hypercomplex Matrix Algebras.

ANTIHERMITICITY PROPERTIES OF COMPLEX LINEAR OCTONIONIC OPERATORS

Let us consider the action of barred operators on octonionic functions

ψ = c1 + e2c2 + e4c3 + e6c4

(c1,...,4 ∈ C) .

With the notation

we will indicate

e2 → {−c2, c1, −c∗

4, c∗

3} ,

e2ψ = − c2 + e2c1 − e4c∗

4 + e6c∗

3 .

The action of a generic octonionic barred operators can be expressed by suitable combinations of he action of barred

operators em and 1 | em

We can immediately verify that e1 represents an antihermitian operator. The antihermiticity of e1 is shown if

ψ†(e1ϕ) = −

In the previous equation the only nonvanishing terms are represented by diagonal terms (∼ c†

The antihermiticity proof of 1 | e1 is very similar to that of e1. The above-mentioned demonstration does not work
for the imaginary units e2, ... , e7 (breaking the symmetry between the seven octonionic imaginary units). In fact for
e2 we ﬁnd
