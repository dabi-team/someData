ABSTRACT

The age and chemical characteristics of the Galactic bulge link to the formation and evolutionary
history of the Galaxy. Data-driven methods and large surveys enable stellar ages and precision
chemical abundances to be determined for vast regions of the Milky Way, including the bulge. Here, we
use the data-driven approach of The Cannon, to infer the ages and abundances for 125,367 stars in the
Milky Way, using spectra from Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment (apogee)
DR14. We examine the ages and metallicities of 1654 bulge stars within RGAL < 3.5 kpc. We focus
on ﬁelds with b < 12◦, and out to longitudes of l < 15◦. We see that stars in the bulge are about
twice as old (τ = 8 Gyr), on average, compared to those in the solar neighborhood (τ = 4 Gyr), with
0.38 compared to 0.23 dex). This age gradient comes primarily from
a larger dispersion in [Fe/H] (
the low-α stars. Looking along the Galactic plane, the very central ﬁeld in the bulge shows by far
90 km/s), and
the largest dispersion in [Fe/H] (σ[F e/H] ≈
simultaneously the smallest dispersion in age. Moving out in longitude, the stars become kinematically
colder and less dispersed in [Fe/H], but show a much broader range of ages. We see a signature of
the X-shape within the bulge at a latitude of b = 8◦, but not at b = 12◦. Future apogee and other
survey data, with larger sampling, aﬀords the opportunity to extend our approach and study in more
detail, to place stronger constraints on models of the Milky Way.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with a
boxy/peanut bulge morphology and an X-shaped struc-
ture (see Gonzalez & Gadotti 2016, and references
therein). Photometric measurements of red clump stars,
which exhibit two density peaks along our line of sight
(e.g. McWilliam & Zoccali 2010; Nataf et al. 2010),
and N -body simulations which show the formation of
boxy/peanut and X-shaped bulges via dynamical insta-
bilities in the disk (e.g. Ness et al. 2012), both provide
evidence of the boxy, X-shaped bulge. This shape can be
seen in the Milky Way from the stellar brightness alone
(Ness & Lang 2016) and indicates that the bulge was, at
least in large part, formed from the disk, via dynamical
instabilities (e.g. Athanassoula 2005; Debattista et al.
2006; Martinez-Valpuesta et al. 2006). Metallicity maps
of the bulge have suggested that the observed properties
of the boxy/peanut bulge are a consequence of the initial
properties of a two-component (thin and thick) disk (e.g.
Gonzalez et al. 2013; Di Matteo et al. 2015; Fragkoudi

tsit@alumni.caltech.edu

et al. 2018). More generally, the disk stellar populations
can separate based on their kinematics (see Debattista
et al. 2017) and today the bulge shows correlations be-
tween chemistry and kinematics (see Babusiaux 2016,
and references therein). With new large surveys across
the Galaxy, we have the opportunity to extensively map
the bulge and surrounding disk, with respect to stel-
lar age in particular (Bovy et al. 2019, e.g.), which has
been shown to vary in the bulge, with younger stars
more strongly exhibiting the X-shape than older stars
(e.g. Debattista et al. 2017; Grady et al. 2020).

The Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Ex-
periment (apogee) survey has observed
470,000 stars
in the Milky Way (Majewski et al. 2017), as released in
DR16 (Ahumada et al. 2020). In this work, we use the
280,000 stars released in DR14 (Blanton et al. 2017).
∼
apogee has obtained high-resolution R = 22, 500 spec-
tra of these stars (Zasowski et al. 2013, 2017) in the
near-infrared (H-band). Observing in the H-band al-
lows for better observations of stars obscured by dust
than observing in the optical band, making it an ideal
instrument for observing the far Galactic disk and bulge.
Relevant to our work, apogee has observed a few spe-
cial ﬁelds of stars in the outer arms of the X-shaped

bulge, as described in Zasowski et al. (2017).

The Cannon is a data-driven approach for measuring
stellar parameters and abundances, collectively called
labels, from stellar spectra (Ness et al. 2015). Such data-
driven methods are, in general, able to learn a relation-
ship between line strength and labels, without necessar-
ily knowing the underlying physics, possibly circumvent-
ing any poorly deﬁned or approximated line strength-
abundance conversion that the traditional methods rely
on. Data-driven models can also ﬁnd labels for a large
dataset with little computational eﬀort. The Cannon,
in particular, can also derive precision stellar labels at
lower signal-to-noise than prior approaches. The Can-
non uses a set of reference objects (the “training set”),
of stars with spectra that have well-deﬁned, high-ﬁdelity
labels, that span the label space of the “test set”, to
create a model. This model captures the relationship
between the ﬂux at every pixel and the label values.
Then, The Cannon uses the model to ﬁt spectra from
stars with unknown labels (the “test set”). The ﬁrst it-
eration of The Cannon has been used to ﬁt 55,000 stars
from apogee DR10 with a training set of only 542 ref-
erence objects (Ness et al. 2015). Later, 450,000 Large
Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope
(LAMOST) giants were labeled using a training set of
9952 reference objects, taken from the stars in common
between the apogee DR12 and LAMOST surveys (Ho
et al. 2017b,a). A more sophisticated, regularized ver-
sion of The Cannon (Casey et al. 2016) has been applied
to label the Radial Velocity Experiment survey with pre-
cision individual abundance measurements (Casey et al.
2017).

2. DATA

For the training set, we started by using 6753 stars
common to apogee DR14 (Holtzman et al. 2018) and
Kepler. The labels of the stars are given by spectro-
scopic parameters from the apogee pipeline, aspcap

which contains a total of 5991 stars.

(Garc´ıa P´erez et al. 2016), and ages from Kepler as-
troseismic data, in the apokasc catalog (Pinsonneault
et al. 2018). We clean the full set of common stars by
making a series of quality cuts. All stars with an anoma-
lous label in metallicity, or C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca,
Ti, V, Mn, Ni, P, Cr, or Co abundance were removed.
An anomalous label was deﬁned as [Fe/H] or [X/Fe] >
1.5. One star with a very high age error was also re-
moved. Finally, a signal-to-noise cut was made, leaving
only stars that had signal-to-noise ratio > 100. After
these quality cuts, 5991 stars remained for the ﬁnal test
set. The test set, whose label space is plotted in Figures
1 and 2, spans 3848 K < Teﬀ < 5223 K, 1.07 < log g <
3.63, and

1.35 < [Fe/H] < 0.46.

The Cannon 1 requires that its input spectra be nor-
malized in a way that is independent of signal-to-noise.

While the apogee spectra we are using are already nor-
malized, an additional signal-to-noise independent nor-
malization was done on all of the spectra used. In this
work, the high- and low-α stars were divided into sep-
arate training sets. For both training sets, the spectra
were ﬁrst divided into three wavelength ranges: 15164-
15794, 15871-16417, and 16485-16936 ˚A. This accounted
for diﬀerent parts of the spectra behaving diﬀerently
- these ranges roughly correspond to the chips of the
spectrograph. Continuum pixels were then identiﬁed,
as those which had median ﬂux over all spectra close
to 1 and little dependence on Teﬀ , log g, or [Fe/H]. The
ﬂux cut was chosen to select only pixels with a median
ﬂux between 0.985 and 1.15. The lack of label depen-
dence was determined by selecting the 30% of pixels with
linear coeﬃcients in each stellar parameter label (Teﬀ ,
log g, [Fe/H]) closest to 0 in the model generated by
the aspcap spectra prior to our additional continuum

normalization step. Pixels that satisﬁed all of these re-
quirements were considered to be continuum. For the
high-α training set, this resulted in 352 pixels, about
4.1% of all pixels, and for the low-α set, this resulted in
373 pixels, about 4.3% of all pixels. The continuum pix-
els were were ﬁt by a third-order Chebyshev function,
then all training spectra were divided by this function,
to obtain the normalized spectra.

A 10-fold cross validation of the model (see Section 3)
was created from the newly normalized training spectra
along with an unnormalized control case to compare the
performance. This resulted in the unnormalized case
performing better by a few percent (see Tables 1 and
2). However, we still choose to adopt the normalization
because it should perform better (consistently) at low
signal to noise.

[Mg/Fe], where [Mg/Fe] is used as a
proxy for overall [α/Fe], of the training set with total 5991
stars. The cutoﬀ line dividing high-α and low-α stars is
shown, dividing the set into 1255 high-α and 4736 low-α
training set stars.

A correlation exists between abundances and ages that
is diﬀerent between stars with a high abundance of α-
elements and those with a low abundance of α-elements
(e.g. Bedell et al. 2018). Therefore, we chose to divide up
our sample of stars into a high-α set and low-α set and
train two separate models with The Cannon. We use
the magnesium abundance enhancement, [Mg/Fe], as a
proxy for the overall α-element abundance [α/Fe]. As
this separation does not need to be extremely accurate,
a linear cutoﬀ line was visually ﬁt to a plot of [Fe/H]
vs. [Mg/Fe] to obtain a cutoﬀ where stars with [Mg/Fe]
> 0.132
[Fe/H] + 0.111 were considered to be high-
α. Figure 3 shows this cutoﬀ on a plot of [Fe/H] vs.
[Mg/Fe]. This yields 1255 high-α training stars and 4736
low-α training stars.

×

In The Cannon, a second-order polynomial model was
trained for each of the high- and low-α training sets. We
performed a 10-fold cross validation for each set, training
the model on 90% of the overall training set and testing
on the other 10%, repeating the process 10 times such
that every star was tested. This cross validation showed
that some of the abundances we had intended to use
were not well recovered and the model became unstable
with small changes to the training and validation sets
using these labels, occasionally failing during one step
of the cross validation. Removing labels that caused
these failures resulted in a high-α model with 13 labels
(Teﬀ , log g, [Fe/H], log (age), and [X/Fe] for X=C, N,
O, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Mn) and a low-α model with 12
labels (the same 13 labels as the high-α case except for
[K/Fe]). Figures 4 and 5 plot the values generated by
The Cannon compared to the reference values used for
training. Figure 4 shows this for all 13 high-α labels and
Figure 5 shows the same for all 12 low-α labels.

The test set of stars were those from the same apogee
DR14 catalog as the training set (but not in the Kepler
astroseismic catalog with ages). Since we do have the
spectroscopic parameters for the test set from apogee’s
pipeline aspcap, stars whose Teﬀ , log g, or [Fe/H] fall
outside the range of the training set were also removed.
This left 30,029 high-α and 95,338 low-α stars in the
test set. This additional selection of the test set cut
helps prevent extrapolation of The Cannon’s model be-
yond the data it was trained on. The test spectra were
normalized in the same way as the training set.

We used the StarHorse catalog (Queiroz et al. 2018) to
obtain the distances to the stars. Using these distances,
we converted the (l, b) Galactic longitude and latitude
coordinates of the stars into (x, y, z) coordinates and
also found RGAL, radius from the Galactic center. A
total of 265 stars did not have distances available.

4. RESULTS

Table 3 provides sample columns from the full table of
our results, available online. For all 125,367 test stars,
we include Teﬀ , log g, [Fe/H], abundances, and ages as
well as all associated label errors and the χ2 for the
generated model compared to the data given the errors
for 8575 pixels. Although we include all results for all
125,367 stars, we make a general χ2 cut, keeping only
stars with χ2 < 16, 000, which leaves 121,278 stars for
analysis. The χ2 distribution of the full set of 125,367
stars and the χ2 cutoﬀ is shown in Figure 6. Addition-
ally, except in section 4.4, we make a distance cut and
keep only stars within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic center for
our bulge analysis, leaving 2567 stars.

Since the apogee Teﬀ , log g, [Fe/H], and abundances
are all available for the test set, we are able to not only
reﬁne our test set to stars within the stellar parameter
range of our training set, but also compare our results
from The Cannon to the aspcap labels. We examine the
apogee stellar parameter and abundance labels vs. the
labels from The Cannon for test stars within the ranges
in the training set for all the stellar parameter and abun-
dance labels. For Teﬀ , we notice a set of stars which
are dissimilar between the two sets of labels, where The
Cannon found very high temperatures compared to the
apogee value. We checked on all apogee ﬂags and
could not see any issues with these stars. These stars
actually make up less than 0.5% of the total test set
however and we do not exclude them from our catalog.
Unless otherwise noted, for these analyses, the high-
and low-α stars were both used together in examining
our bulge ages, metallicities and abundance distribu-
tions. There were a few stars that we obtained labels
for using The Cannon that did not have distances in the
StarHorse catalog; 52 of the stars we kept after the χ2
cut were removed from our analysis for this reason.

15◦,

We select only stars within RGAL < 3.5 kpc for our
analysis, which leaves us with a total of 2567 stars.
From these 2567 stars, we further select stars within
the bulge region that we deﬁne to be (
15◦) <
(l, b) < (15◦, 15◦), leaving 1654 bulge stars for our anal-
ysis. These stars have typical distance errors of 0.86 kpc.
Monte Carlo modeling of 1000 samples shows that these
distance errors induce an uncertainty of 5% in stars we
select with RGAL < 3.5 kpc. There is less than 2% un-
certainty on all following mean and dispersion measure-
ments of age and metallicity due to this uncertainty in
stars we select. Using this set of 1654 stars, we want to
examine how stellar ages, metallicities and abundances
change over the extent of the bulge and with radius in
the inner region. With DR14 we have a limited set of
ﬁelds to examine within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic center.

These ﬁelds are plotted in Figure 7. We therefore break
up our examination into the following: (i) along the mi-
nor axis, (ii) along the major axis, (iii) across the entire
bulge, and (iv) comparing the bulge to the disk. Our
results are detailed in the following subsections.

We ﬁrst focus on the (l, b) = (0◦, 8◦) and (l, b) =
(0◦, 12◦) ﬁelds. These two ﬁelds had special targeting
applied to obtain red clump stars (Zasowski et al. 2017),
so we consider them in isolation. We only include stars
within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic center in our analysis of
these ﬁelds. This yields 122 stars in the (l, b) = (0◦, 8◦)
ﬁeld and 213 stars in the (l, b) = (0◦, 12◦) ﬁeld.

The majority of the stars in both ﬁelds have log g be-
tween 2.0 and 3.0 dex. We select the stars that fall
within this log g range only, which further excludes the

Figure 6. χ2 distribution of the test set from the model ﬁt
compared to the data for each star. We make a conserva-
tive cut for our stars we use in our analysis, keeping only
stars with χ2 < 16, 000. This corresponds to a χ2 that is
approximately twice the number of pixels as the data. Of
total 125,367 stars in the test set, 121,278 made this χ2 cut.

parent magnitudes in the b = 8◦ ﬁeld that disappears by
the b = 12◦ ﬁeld. This “gap” is presumably tracing the
X-shaped structure in the Milky Way bulge, and this
ﬁnding shows that the line-of-sight observations do not
traverse the arms of the X-shape at Galactic latitudes
of b = 12◦, or 1.7 kpc above the plane in the center of
the bulge. This is also consistent with the Ness & Lang
(2016) image of the bulge, which shows the X-shape ex-
10◦. This also indicates
tending to slightly below b =
that the ﬁeld at b = 8◦ is presumably tracing the ends
of the X-shape structure.

The left-hand panel of Figure 9 shows the age distri-
butions for these two ﬁelds. The two ﬁelds seem to have
7 Gyr. However, the lower,
a similar mean age of τ
≈
(l, b) = (0◦, 8◦), ﬁeld has an
40 percent larger age dis-
persion. The right-hand panel of Figure 9 shows the
[Fe/H] distribution of these two ﬁelds. The metallicity
distribution of the two ﬁelds is more strikingly dissimi-
lar between the ﬁelds. The (l, b) = (0◦, 8◦) ﬁeld has two
peaks around [Fe/H] = 0.25 dex and [Fe/H] = 0.6 dex
and has a larger fraction of metal-rich stars compared to
the higher-latitude ﬁeld. The ﬁeld at (l, b) = (0◦, 12◦)
has a signiﬁcantly larger fraction of metal poor stars
around [Fe/H] = -0.6 dex. However, we did not observe
any clear trends in the metallicity dependence of the
X-shape; this could be due to the sample size being too
small for a full investigation. We also ﬁnd for both ﬁelds
that stars of ﬁxed age have a broad and similar range in
[Fe/H].

We now examine the ages and metallicities of stars
along the minor axis, l = 0◦, for all b within RGAL <
3.5 kpc of the Galactic center. The previously discussed
(l, b) = (0◦, 8◦) and (l, b) = (0◦, 12◦) ﬁelds each extend

Figure 7. The distribution of observed stars in the bulge
region across (l, b). We consider the bulge region to be within
(−15◦, −15◦) < (l, b) < (15◦, 15◦). This yields a total of 1654
stars out of 2567 total stars within RGAL < 3.5 kpc of the
Galactic center. Red stars indicate those along the minor
axis at l = 0◦, that were selected for further analysis in

few stars which are likely not red clump (e.g. Ness et al.
2013). For the remaining 117 and 152 stars in the ﬁelds
at b = 8◦ and b = 12◦ respectively, we plot the dered-
dened apparent magnitude in the K band in Figure 8,
which for the red clump is a proxy for distance along
the line of sight. We calculate the dereddened apparent
magnitude by subtracting with Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Sur-
vey Explorer K-band extinction from the Two Micron
All Sky Survey magnitude; both quantities are given in
the aspcap data ﬁle. Doing so reveals a “gap” in ap-

stars by a set of spatial ﬁelds. The (l, b) = (0◦, 8◦) ﬁeld
encompasses stars between (
1◦, 7◦) < (l, b) < (1◦, 9◦);
the (l, b) = (0◦, 12◦) ﬁeld encompasses stars between

(

all remaining stars with
1◦ < l < 1◦ and bin them

every 2◦, resulting in six additional groups of l = 0◦
stars. However, the group centered at (l, b) = (0◦, 0◦)
contained far fewer stars than the others (seven stars),
so we exclude it from further analysis. This results in a
total of 627 stars for our minor-axis analysis.

The left panel of Figure 10 shows the mean metallic-
ities for the six ﬁelds along l = 0◦, as described. The
sampling error, σ/√N, where N is the number of stars
in the ﬁeld, is also plotted as a measure of conﬁdence

in the mean measurement. The right panel of Figure
10 shows the standard deviation of metallicities of the
six ﬁelds along l = 0◦, and we also plot their sampling

errors, σ/√2N
for the ages, radial velocity, and K-band extinction, re-
spectively. We include velocity and K-band extinction
as checks for correlations or systematics (i.e. that could
impact the distance distribution of the stars) which may
aﬀect our age and metallicity results.

As seen in the left panel of Figure 10, we ﬁnd that
along l = 0◦, the metallicity decreases from b = 0◦, both
above and below the plane. In Figure 11, for age along
l = 0◦, unlike for metallicity, we ﬁnd a slight asymmetry.
The stars at negative b seem to be older on average than
those at positive b. This asymmetry is likely related to

extinction eﬀects: Figure 13 shows that the negative
b ﬁelds have lower mean Ak and greater scatter in Ak
than the positive b ﬁelds. Compared to those at pos-
itive b, the negative b ﬁelds have generally more stars
close to the Galactic center, so the asymmetry may also
be related to the distance distribution. We also ﬁnd a
very slight asymmetry in the same direction, higher at
negative b and lower at positive b, in the average ra-
dial velocity, shown in Figure 12. The age and [Fe/H]
dispersion are variable along the minor axis and in gen-
eral uncorrelated. The highest-latitude ﬁeld however at

(l, b) = (0◦, 12◦) has both the lowest age and [Fe/H]
dispersion.

We now want to examine trends of age with Galactic
radius for the stars in these ﬁelds. We consider the high
and low latitudes separately. In the top panel of Figure
14, we show age as a function of Galactic radius for
our lower latitude ﬁelds of (l, b) = (0◦,

latitude combined ﬁelds compared to the lower-latitude
combined ﬁelds. We ﬁt a second-order polynomial to
all the stars in each combined ﬁeld. Comparing the
high and lower latitudes, we ﬁnd that near the Galactic
center, the higher-latitude ﬁelds are on average younger
than those of the lower-latitude ﬁelds. Also, while at
higher latitudes we generally ﬁnd slightly older stars fur-
ther away from the Galactic center, the opposite is true
for the lower-latitude ﬁelds. The slope of the age-radius
gradient is also shallower for the (l, b) = (0◦, 8◦) and
(0◦, 12◦) ﬁelds.

4.1.1. Element Abundance Trends along the Minor Axis

In addition to age and metallicity, we also examine the
distributions of the other elements in the (l, b) = (0◦, 8◦)
compared to the (l, b) = (0◦, 12◦) ﬁelds. We plot these
distributions in Figure 16.
Interestingly, the distribu-
tions are the same for some of the elements but quite
diﬀerent for others. For the elements that are diﬀerent
between the ﬁelds, particularly [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe],
and [Ca/Fe], the distributions diﬀer in the same way:
the (l, b) = (0◦, 8◦) ﬁeld has a larger proportion of less
enriched stars. That is, there are a signiﬁcantly larger
fraction of low-α stars at lower latitudes in the inner

4.2. Age Trends along the Major Axis
Now we examine the stars within RGAL ≤

3.5 kpc,
along the major axis, b = 0◦, as shown in blue in Figure
7. This includes 357 stars. We divide these stars into
7◦ < l < 7◦, 7◦ <
three ﬁelds, of
l < 10◦, and 10◦ < l < 13◦. We refer to these ﬁelds
as the (l, b) = (0◦, 0◦), (7.5◦, 0◦), and (10.5◦, 0◦) ﬁelds,
respectively.

The left-hand panel of Figure 17 shows the mean
metallicity along the major axis, as calculated for each
of the three ﬁelds described above. At b = 0◦, there is
a marginal increase in metallicity as l increases. The
right-hand panel of Figure 17 shows the 1-σ standard

deviation of the [Fe/H]. We ﬁnd that the standard de-
viation markedly decreases as l increases.

Figure 18 shows the mean age and age dispersion along
the major axis. We do not observe any signiﬁcant gradi-
ent in the mean age along the major axis b = 0, as shown
in the left-hand panel of the ﬁgure. The right-hand panel
of Figure 18 shows the 1σ standard deviation of the age
in the three ﬁelds. This is lowest for the (l, b) = (0◦, 0◦)
ﬁeld and fairly similar for the other two ﬁelds, which are
about 15% higher.

Figure 19 shows the mean radial velocity and velocity
dispersion along the major axis. We observe an increase
in mean radial velocity as l increases, similar to the one
found in the metallicity in Figure 17. We also notice that
the (l, b) = (0◦, 0◦) ﬁeld has a notably higher velocity
dispersion than the other two ﬁelds, and the (l, b) =
(7.5◦, 0◦) ﬁeld has a lower velocity dispersion than the
(l, b) = (10.5◦, 0◦) ﬁeld. This is inversely correlated with

that the bulge is primarily old (e.g., Ortolani et al.
1995; Zoccali et al. 2003; Clarkson et al. 2011;
Renzini et al. 2018).
Spectroscopic studies have,
however, revealed a fraction of young stars to be
present (i.e., Bensby et al. 2010, 2013, 2017). Our
results, of an age distribution of primarily old stars,
but with a tail including younger stars, is broadly
consistent with these prior ﬁndings. We have an

stars, at about 8 Gyr compared to 4 Gyr.

≈

We found that when we divided stars into the high-
and low-α populations in the inner Galaxy (RGAL <
3.5 kpc), the two populations showed similar mean ages
(τ
8 Gyr). In Figure 22, we show the age distribu-
tions for the high and low-α populations near the Sun.
In the solar neighborhood, the mean age of the low-α
stars is τ = 3.5 Gyr, which is about half of that of the
high-α stars near the Sun, at τ = 7.5 Gyr. So, not only
is there a signiﬁcant gradient in stellar age as a function
of radius, with age decreasing from the inner to outer
Galaxy, but this gradient is signiﬁcantly higher, and pri-
marily coming from the low-α population, which is old
in the inner region.

5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have used the data-driven approach of The Can-
non to obtain ages and abundances for 125,367 apogee
stars. We provide the catalog of these here and un-
dertake an analysis of the 2567 stars within the bulge
region of RGAL < 3.5kpc. For this analysis, we have
examined the age, metallicity, and abundance distribu-
tions, in particular focusing on diﬀerences in these as a
function of longitude and latitude along the minor and
major axes. We investigated the red clump stars that
have been targeted in two high-latitude ﬁelds, to test for
signatures of the X-shape. We have also contrasted the
age and metallicity distributions for stars in the bulge,
compared to the disk. The main conclusions we draw
from our analyses are as follows.

1. We see that the bulge is signiﬁcantly older than
the disk, with a mean age of 8 Gyr compared to 4
Gyr (calculated for stars within
< 1 kpc). Many
photometric studies of the bulge have demonstrated

standard deviation σ[Fe/H] = 0.38 dex while the region near the sun has mean [Fe/H] = -0.05 dex and standard deviation σ[Fe/H]
= 0.23 dex.

age error from The Cannon of about 0.2 dex for
both the high- and low-α subsets.
In Figure 23,
we see that the bulge has an age distribution with
σlog τ = 0.24 and the disk has an age distribution
with σlog τ = 0.33. We can calculate a more precise
upper limit for the underlying age dispersion (but
convolved with the age measurement error of the
reference objects which is approximately propa-
gated from training to test) of each region using
the cross-validation age error from The Cannon:

σunderlying = (cid:0)σ2

(cid:1)1/2

This yields an underlying age dispersion of σlog τ =
0.13 dex in the bulge and σlog τ 0.26 dex in the disk,

which corresponds to an age dispersion of σlog τ ≈
Gyr for the disk and bulge, respectively.
2. Considering all stars in our ﬁelds within RGAL <
3.5kpc, we ﬁnd a negative age gradient with RGAL at
low latitudes and a positive age gradient with RGAL
at high latitudes. This may be a consequence of ex-
amining diﬀerent populations; the inside-out forming
thin disk and the older, vertically extended, thicker
disk population (e.g. Debattista et al. 2017; Clarke
et al. 2019; Mackereth et al. 2019).

3. From the abundances for bulge stars within RGAL <
3.5kpc, we see that, similarly to the solar neighbor-
hood, the low-α stars are found preferentially near
the plane and the high-α stars at larger heights from
the plane. There is an age gradient that we see in
the bulge with age decreasing from the oldest stars
in the inner region to younger stars in the outer re-
gion. This is a consequence of inside-out formation

(e.g. see Frankel et al. 2019). We see that looking at
the low-α and high-α stars separately, only the low-α
stars decrease in their mean age from bulge to solar
neighborhood. The high and low-α stars in the bulge
have similar mean ages (around 8 Gyr). However,
the high and low-α stars around the Sun have mean
ages of 8 Gyr and 4 Gyr, respectively. The diﬀerent
ages that we see across the [Fe/H]-[α/Fe] plane, in
the inner compared to the outer region, places strong
constraints on models of the disk’s formation.

4. Two ﬁelds on the minor axis, at (l, b) = (0◦, 8◦)
and (0◦, 12◦), were speciﬁcally targeted for red clump
stars, which were further isolated using a log g cut us-
ing the inferred stellar parameters. These red clump
stars show a gap in K-band apparent magnitude in
the (l, b) = (0◦, 8◦) ﬁeld, but not at (l, b) = (0◦, 12◦).
This gap indicates that the X-shaped structure in the
bulge is no longer present along the line of sight at
the higher latitude, (l, b) = (0◦, 12◦).

5. Along the minor axis, the mean metallicity decreases
fairly smoothly with galactic latitude, b. The mean
ages show a less clear trend, and the ages are higher
at negative latitudes compared to positive ones. The
age and metallicity dispersion are scattered across
latitude along the minor axis, with no clear corre-
lation between the level of scatter in age and that in
metallicity. However, the ﬁeld with the lowest dis-
persion in both age and metallicity is that at the
highest latitude, outside of the X-shape structure, at
(l, b) = (0◦, 12◦).

6. Along the major axis, the dispersion in metallicity

center, as does the line-of-sight velocity dispersion.
Conversely, the age dispersion is signiﬁcantly smaller
in the Galactic center compared to larger longitudes.

In summary, the bulge is an old population with an
age of τ
3 Gyr, with a large range in metallicity.
The Galactic center shows the largest spread in metal-
licity and smallest spread in age compared to farther
out in l and b and radius, in the disk. The signature of
inside-out formation in the disk is present in the low-α
stars, but not the high-α ones. Our ensemble of results
constrain models of Galactic formation and link directly
to simulations, via our measure of ages.

The number of stars in the bulge region will signiﬁ-

17

cantly increase with the public data release of apogee
DR16 and Sloan V ’s Milky Way Mapper survey. The
approach we have implemented in order to derive abun-
dances and ages as well as our analysis is directly trans-
ferable to these new data, which will include many hun-
dreds of thousands of stars in the bulge region.
