ABSTRACT

A model of the Galaxy with the outer ring R1R2 can explain the observed distri-
bution of the radial, VR, and azimuthal, VT , velocity components along the Galacto-
centric distance, R, derived from the Gaia EDR3 data. We selected stars from the Gaia
EDR3 catalogue with reliable parallaxes, proper motions and line-of-sight velocities
lying near the Galactic plane, |z| < 200 pc, and in the sector of the Galactocen-
tic angles |θ| < 15◦ and calculated the median velocities VR and VT in small bins
along the distance R. The distribution of observed velocities appears to have some
speciﬁc features: the radial velocity VR demonstrates a smooth fall from +5 km s−1
at the distance of R ≈ R0 − 1.5 kpc to −3 km s−1 at R ≈ R0 + 1.0 kpc while
the azimuthal velocity VT shows a sharp drop by 7 km s−1 in the distance interval
R0 < R < R0 + 1.0 kpc, where R0 is the solar Galactocentric distance. We build a
model of the Galaxy including bulge, bar, disc and halo components, which repro-
duces the observed speciﬁc features of the velocity distribution in the Galactocentric
distance interval |R − R0| < 1.5 kpc. The best agreement corresponds to the time
1.8 ± 0.5 Gyr after the start of the simulation. A model of the Galaxy with the bar
rotating at the angular velocity of Ωb = 55 ± 3 km s−1 kpc−1, which sets the OLR of
the bar at the distance of R0 − 0.5 ± 0.4 kpc, provides the best agreement between
the model and observed velocities. The position angle of the bar, θb, corresponding to
the best agrement between the model and observed velocities is θb = 45 ± 15◦.

INTRODUCTION

Bars were found in nearly 70 per cent of bright disc galax-
ies (Eskridge et al. 2000; Men´endez-Delmestre et al. 2007).
On the whole, the fraction of barred galaxies increases
with decreasing redshift, but during the last
4 Gyr, the
fraction of barred galaxies changes negligibly (Sheth et al.
2008; Melvin, Masters et al. 2013). In many cases the for-
mation of a bar does not require an external perturba-
tion but results from the secular evolution of galaxies
(Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004).

∼

There are a lot of data indicating the presence of the bar
in the Galaxy. The gas kinematics (Pohl et al. 2008; Gerhard
2011; Pettitt et al. 2014), infrared observations (Dwek et al.
1995; Benjamin et al. 2005; Cabrera-Lavers et al. 2007;
Churchwell et al. 2009; Gonz´alez-Fern´andez et al. 2012), as

tral part of the disc (Li & Shen 2012; Ness & Lang 2016;
Simion et al. 2017) conﬁrm the presence of a bar in the
Galaxy. Estimates of the length of the bar semi-major axis
and its angular velocity lie in the range a = 3–5 kpc and
Ωb = 30–60 km s−1 kpc−1, respectively. The position an-
gle of the bar with respect to the Sun is supposed to be
θb = 15–45◦, implying that the end of the bar that is near-
est to the Sun is located in quadrant I.

The age of the Galactic bar is a subject of scientiﬁc de-
bates (Nataf 2016; Haywood et al. 2016; Bensby et al. 2017;
Bernard et al. 2017; Fujii et al. 2019; Carrillo et al. 2019).
Here we consider a strong bar rotating with a constant an-
gular velocity, though oval structures existed in the Galactic
disc much earlier. The presence of young metal-rich stars in
the Galactic disc at the distances of R = 2–3 kpc from
the center supports the idea that the Galactic bar formed
2–3 Gyr ago (Debattista et al. 2019; Baba & Kawata 2020;
Hasselquist et al. 2020, and other papers).

2/1 corresponds to the Outer Lindblad Resonance

1980; Contopoulos & Grosbol 1989).

The resonance between the orbital rotation with re-
spect to the bar and the epicyclic motion causes the for-
mation of elliptic resonance rings. There are three types
of resonance rings: nuclear (n), inner (r) and outer (R1
and R2) rings. The nuclear rings lie near the ILR and are
stretched perpendicular to the bar; the inner rings form near
the inner 4/1 resonance and are oriented along the bar;
the outer rings R1 and R2 are located near the OLR: the
rings R1 or pseudorings R′
1 (broken rings) lie a bit closer
to the galactic center and are stretched perpendicular to
the bar while the rings R2 or pseudorings R′
2 are located
a bit father away from the center and are stretched par-
allel to the bar. There is also a mixed morphological type

2 outer rings/pseudorings
(Buta 1995; Buta & Combes 1996; Buta & Crocker 1991;
Rodriguez-Fernandez & Combes 2008; Sormani et al. 2018).
The fraction of galaxies with outer rings is as high as 20–
30 per cent among galaxies with strong and moderate bars
(Comeron et al. 2014).

The backbone of resonance rings is stable direct
periodic orbits which are followed by numerous quasi-
periodic orbits. There are two basic families of stable
direct periodic orbits, x1 and x2. Orbits of the x1 family
support the bar inside the corotation radius. Orbits of
the x2 family are elongated perpendicular to the bar
and support the nuclear rings between two ILRs. Near
the OLR of the bar the main family of periodic orbits
x1 splits into two families: x1(1) and x1(2). The main
4/1 and
stable periodic orbits x1(2) lying between the
2/1 (OLR) resonances are elongated perpendicular to
−
the bar while the orbits x1(1) located outside the OLR
are stretched along the bar. The periodic orbits x1(2)

Athanassoula et al. (2009) studied manifold tubes ema-
nating from the unstable Lagrangian points located near the
ends of the bar. They showed that less strong bars give rise
to R1 rings/pseudorings, while stronger bars drive spirals,
R2 and R1R2 rings/pseudorings.

The bimodal velocity distribution of disc stars in
the solar neighborhood can be explained by the lo-
cation of the Sun near the OLR of the bar (Kalnajs
1991; Dehnen 2000; Fux 2001; Fragkoudi et al. 2019;
Sanders, Smith & Evans
2020;
Trick et al. 2021; Chiba, Friske & Schonrich 2021, and
other papers). Furthermore, galaxies with a ﬂat rotation
curve and a fast bar, which ends near the corotation radius

2a. For the Galaxy,
this distance nearly corresponds to the solar Galactocentric
distance, R0.

≈

Modelling of the outer rings shows that they form 0.5–
1.0 Gyr after the bar is turned on. The ring R1 appears
ﬁrst while the ring R2 forms a bit later,
1 Gyr after
the start of the simulation (Schwarz 1981; Byrd et al. 1994;
Rautiainen & Salo 1999, 2000). Rautiainen & Salo (2000)
studied the outer ring morphology in N-body models and
found cyclic changes in the ring type: from R1R′

back to R1R′

Models with analytical bars are of particular in-
terest in studies of the kinematics of Galactic stars.
Melnik & Rautiainen (2009) showed that a model of the
Galaxy with a two-component outer ring R1R′
2 can ex-
plain the average velocities of young stars in the Sagittarius
and Perseus star-gas complexes (Efremov & Sitnik 1988).
Melnik (2019) found that a model of the Galaxy with a bar
2 km s−1
rotating with the angular velocity of Ωb = 50
kpc−1 can reproduce the average velocities of young stars
in three star-gas complexes: Sagittarius, Perseus and Local
System. The Sagittarius complex with the average radial
2.1 km s−1, directed away from the
velocity, VR = +7.5
Galactic center belongs to the ring R1 while the Perseus
2.2 km s−1,
complex with the radial velocity, VR =
directed toward the Galactic center is associated with the
ring R2. The Local System is located between these two com-
plexes and has the average radial velocity of VR = +5.4
2.6
km s−1. The model considered can reproduce the velocity in
the Local System during the time period 1–2 Gyr after the
start of modelling. The best agreement with observations
corresponds to the position angle of the bar lying in the
range θb = 40–52◦.

Rautiainen & Melnik (2010) built an N-body model of
the Galaxy which demonstrates the formation of a bar and
outer rings. The velocities of model particles were averaged
over 1 Gyr time periods for comparison with observations.
Such averaging suppresses the inﬂuence of slow modes and
random velocity changes. The average model velocities in
N-body models reproduce the observed velocities of young
stars in the Sagittarius, Perseus and Local System star-gas
complexes.

The kinematics and distribution of classical Cepheids,
OB associations and young star clusters in the 3-kpc so-
lar neighborhood are indicative of the presence of ”the
tuning-fork-like” structure in the Galactic disc, which can
be accounted for by the existence of two segments of the
outer rings fusing together near the Carina star-gas com-
plex (Melnik et al. 2015, 2016). In addition, models of the
Galaxy with a two-component outer ring R1R′
2 can repro-
duce the location of the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm, where
the Carina arm is located near the segment of the outer
ring R2 while the Sagittarius arm lies near the ring R1
(Melnik & Rautiainen 2011).

The early installment of the third Gaia data release
(Gaia EDR3) including proper motions and parallaxes
for 1.5 billion stars opens new possibilities
the
study of the Galactic structure and kinematics. Gaia
EDR3 also lists 7.2 million stellar line-of-sight veloci-
ties presented by the second Gaia data release (Gaia

In this paper we study the kinematics of Galactic
stars with the Gaia EDR3 data and build a model of the
Galaxy which reproduces the observed distributions of the
radial and azimuthal velocities along the Galactocentric dis-
tance. Section 2 describes the observational data. Section 3
presents the dynamical model of the Galaxy. Section 4 de-
scribes the results: a comparison of the observed and model
velocities and velocity dispersions, the search for the optimal
values of the bar angular velocity, Ωb, and the positional an-
gle of the bar, θb. The discussion and main conclusions are
given in section 5.

2 OBSERVATIONAL DATA

The average accuracy of proper motions and parallaxes of
the Gaia EDR3 catalogue allows the velocities and distances
to stars located within 1 kpc from the Sun to be derived with
0.2 km s−1 and
the average error of
50 pc, respectively.
The average accuracy of Gaia EDR3 line-of-sight velocities

We selected Gaia EDR3 stars located near the Galactic
< 200 pc, and in the sector of the Galactocen-
plane,
< 15◦ that have parallaxes, ̟, determined
tric angles
with the relative error less than 20 per cent (̟/ε̟ > 5)
and line-of-sight velocities measured by the Gaia spectrom-
eter. We excluded from the initial sample of Gaia EDR3
stars (2886715 stars) 493472 objects (17 per cent) with the
re-normalized error (RUWE) greater than RUWE > 1.4
(Lindegren et al. 2018). The ﬁnal sample of Gaia EDR3
stars includes 2393243 objects. The heliocentric distances
to stars were derived from Gaia EDR3 parallaxes without
any zero-point correction: r = 1/̟.

We also compared observational distributions derived
from the Gaia EDR3 and Gaia DR2 data. The initial sample
of Gaia DR2 stars lying near the Galactic plane,
< 200
< 15◦
pc, and in the sector of the Galactocentric angles
that have reliable parallaxes and known line-of-sight veloc-
ities includes 2987601 objects. We excluded from the initial
sample 243059 stars (8.1 per cent) with the re-normalized
error RUWE > 1.4 and 75504 stars (2.5 per cent) with the
number of visibility periods nvis 6 8. The heliocentric dis-
tances, r, were derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes, ̟, in the
following way:

where ∆̟ is a parallax zero-point oﬀset. The value of the
oﬀset ∆̟ depends on the magnitude G: the brighter the
star, the larger the absolute value of ∆̟. For stars with
G = 8m the oﬀset ∆̟ attains the value of
0.120 mas

while for quasars it is only ∆̟ =
0.030 mas (Arenou et al.

excluded stars with the magnitude G < 10m (220710
stars) and adopted for all Gaia DR2 stars the paral-
lax zero-point oﬀset of ∆̟ =
0.05 mas (Riess et al.

of Gaia DR2 stars includes 2448328 objects.

Fig. 1(a) shows the observational sample of stars se-
lected from the Gaia EDR3 catalogue. The distribution of
stars along the Galactocentric distance R was subdivided
into 250-pc wide bins. Fig. 1(b) shows the number of stars,
n, in bins at diﬀerent distances R calculated for the Gaia
EDR3 and Gaia DR2 catalogues. We can see that the Gaia
EDR3 catalogue includes considerably more stars in the dis-
tance interval R = 4–5 kpc than the Gaia DR2 catalogue.

2008; Groenewegen, Udalski & Bono

We adopted the solar Galactocentric distance to be
of R0 = 7.5 kpc (Glushkova et al. 1998; Nikiforov 2004;
Feast et al.
2008;
Reid et al. 2009; Dambis et al. 2013; Francis & Anderson
2014; Boehle et al. 2016; Branham 2017). On the whole, the
choice of the value of R0 in the range 7–9 has virtually no
eﬀect on the results.

The velocity components of the Sun in the Galactic cen-
tre rest frame in the directions toward the Galactic rotation,
VT 0, toward the Galactic center, VR0, and in the direction
perpendicular to the Galactic plane, VZ0, are adopted to
be VT 0 = Ω0R0 + 12.0 km s−1, VR0 = 10.0 km s−1 and
VZ0 = 7.0 km s−1, where Ω0 is the angular velocity of the
rotation of the Galactic disc at the solar distance R0 and its
value is taken to be Ω0 = 30.0 km s−1 kpc−1. The adopted
Ω0, VT 0, VR0 and VZ0 are consistent with values derived
from an analysis of the kinematics of OB associations with
the Gaia DR2 data (Melnik & Dambis 2020).

The velocities of stars in the radial, VR, and azumuthal,
VT , directions as well as in the direction perpendicular to the
Galactic plane, VZ, are computed in the following way:

VR = (Vr cos b

Vb sin b) sin α + Vl cos α

where the angle α is:

and Vr is the line-of-sight velocity. The stellar velocities
along the Galactic longitude Vl and latitude Vb are deter-
mined from the relations:

Vl = 4.74 µl r,

Vb = 4.74 µb r,

(7)

(8)

where µl and µb are Gaia proper motions along the Galactic
longitude and latitude, respectively. The factor 4.74
r (kpc)
transforms units of mas yr−1 into km s−1.

Fig. 2 (left panel) shows the variations in the median
velocities, VR, VT and VZ , with the Galactocentric distance,
R, derived from the Gaia EDR3 and Gaia DR2 data. The
median velocities are calculated in ∆R = 250-pc wide bins.
The average errors in the determination of the median Gaia
EDR3 velocities VR, VT and VZ in bins at the interval R = 5–
10 kpc are 0.16, 0.11 and 0.07 km s−1, respectively.

Fig. 2(a) shows that the radial velocity VR reaches a
maximum of +5 km s−1 at the distance of R
6 kpc and
a minimum of VR
8.5 kpc. We can
also see that the VR-proﬁle derived from the Gaia DR3 data

Fig. 2(c) shows a sharp drop of the azimuthal ve-
locity, VT , by ∆VT = 7 km s−1 in the distance interval
R = 7.0–8.5 kpc. We can also see noticeably lower velocities
VT in the distance interval R = 4.0–5.5 kpc, which can
be due to the lack of thin-disc stars in this region. The
extinction in the middle of the Galactic plane grows
very rapidly in the direction toward the Galactic center
(Neckel & Klare 1980; Marshall et al. 2006; Melnik et al.
2016), so our sample of Gaia stars at the distances of
R = 4.0–5.5 kpc can contain a larger fraction of stars
associated with the thick disc and halo than in other
regions. The sources for which a line-of-sight velocity is
listed in the Gaia DR2 and EDR3 catalogues mostly have
the magnitude brighter than G = 13m. So the fraction
of thin and thick disk stars as well as the proportion of
young versus old stars must depend on the place in the
Galactic disc (Gaia Collaboration, Brown, Vallenari et al.

Sartoretti et al.

exceed
but demonstrates the velocity bend at greater heliocen-
0.1 km s−1)
tric distances: VZ is negative (VZ =
in the distance interval of R = 4.0–5.0 kpc and positive
0.1 km s−1) at R = 10.0 kpc. Generally, the
(VZ = +0.5
VZ-velocity bend can be due to two circumstances: wrong
distance scale at large heliocentric distances, r > 2 kpc,
plus some ripple of the Galactic disc. The preponderance of
objects at negative or positive Galactic latitudes (the rip-
ple) produces some excess in the average value of the term
Vr sin b (Eq. 5), which can be uncompensated by the term
Vb cos b due to the distance-scale errors, because Vb is di-
rectly proportional to the heliocentric distance r (Eq. 5 and
8, see also discussion in Melnik & Dambis 2020).

Fig. 2 (right panel) shows the distributions of the ve-
locity dispersions in the radial, azimuthal and vertical direc-
tions, σR, σT and σZ, along the Galactocentric distance, R,
derived from the Gaia EDR3 and Gaia DR2 data. The me-
dian velocity dispersion in each bin was determined as half of
the central velocity interval including 68 per cent of objects.
We approximated the variations in the velocity dispersions
with the distance R by the exponential law and obtained
the following dependencies for the Gaia EDR3 data in the

listed in Table 1. Note that our estimate of the scale length
SR = 22.3
1.4 kpc is consistent with the value calculated by
Eilers at al. (2019), SR = 21 kpc. The characteristic scales
derived from the Gaia DR2 catalogue (SR = 19.9
1.1 kpc,
±
ST = 10.7
2.4 kpc) agree with
0.9 kpc and ST = 26.4
the scale lengths calculated for the Gaia EDR3 data. Such a
large diﬀerence between the values of SR and ST can be due
to systematic eﬀects. The space distribution of stars in our
sample (Fig. 1a) suggests that the dispersion of radial ve-
locities, σR, is mainly determined by line-of-sight velocities
while those of azimuthal velocities, σT , is mostly determined
by proper motions and parallaxes, which are subject to sys-
tematic eﬀects to a greater extent.

±

The dispersion of radial velocities σR at the solar dis-
tance amounts to σR = 32.5 km s−1 while the value derived
from the smoothed distribution (Eq. 9) is σR = 31.5 km s−1.
The root-mean-square deviations between the median
velocities in bins derived from the Gaia DR2 data and from
Gaia EDR3 data in the distance interval 5.5–9.5 kpc amount
to 0.4, 0.9 and 0.5 km s−1 for the components VR, VT and
VZ, respectively.

3.1 General remarks

In the previous section we showed that there are no con-
spicuous systematic motions in the direction perpendicular
to the Galactic disc in the vicinity of
< 1.5 kpc
from the Sun. So the motions in the Galactic plane and
in the vertical direction can be thought to be independent,
which gives us a possibility to consider a 2D model of the
Galaxy.

We built a model of the Galaxy that includes the bulge,
bar, exponential disc and halo. The bar is modelled as a Fer-
rers ellipsoid with the volume-density distribution ρ deﬁned
as follows:

ρ =

(12)

where ρ0 is the central density, ξ equals ξ2 = x2/a2 + y2/b2
but a and b are the lengths of the major and minor semi-
axes of the bar, respectively. The exponent n is adopted to
be n = 2. The mass of the bar Mb and the central density
ρ0 are related by the expression:

Mb = ρ0

(Freeman 1970; Athanassoula et al. 1983; Pfenniger 1984;
Binney & Tremaine 2008; Sellwood & Wilkinson 1993).

The main model requirement is that the model must
reproduce the observed proﬁles of the radial, VR, and az-
imuthal, VT , velocities as well as the proﬁles of the velocity
dispersions, σR and σT (Fig. 2). In addition, the model rota-
tion curve must be ﬂat on the Galactic periphery and have
the angular velocity of Ω0 = 30 km s−1 kpc−1 at the solar
distance, which agrees with observations and corresponds
to the solar azimuthal velocity VT 0 = Ω0R0 + 12 km s−1
used for calculations of stellar velocities with respect to the
Galactic center (section 2).

angles |θ| < 15◦ (gray points). We selected Gaia EDR3 stars with reliable parallaxes, known proper motions and line-of-sight velocities.
Only 1 per cent of objects are shown. For an example, we outlined one ∆R = 250-pc wide bin by two arcs. The Galactic center (GC) is
at the bottom, the axes x and y are directed toward the Galactic rotation and away from the Galactic center, respectively; the Sun is at
the origin. (b) Logarithmic dependencies of the numbers of stars, n, in 250-pc wide bins on the distance R derived from the Gaia EDR3

model includes N = 107 particles that simulate the motion
of stars in the Galactic disc. This number is enough to pro-
duce the velocity proﬁles with an accuracy comparable to
the observational one.

Fig. 3(a) shows the contribution of the bulge, bar, disc
and halo to the total rotation curve. The total rotation curve
is practically ﬂat on the periphery and corresponds to the
angular velocity of the disc rotation at the solar distance
equal to Ω0 = 30.0 km s−1 kpc−1.

Table 2 lists the model parameters of the bar, bulge, disc
and halo. The semi-major and semi-minor axes of the bar are
adopted to be a = 3.5 and b = 1.35 kpc, respectively. The
mass of the bar is 1.2 1010 M⊙. The angular velocity of the
bar is taken to be Ωb = 55 km s−1 kpc−1, which corresponds
to the location of the corotation radius (Ω = Ωb) and the
OLR of the bar at the distances of RCR = 4.04 kpc and
ROLR = 7.00 kpc, respectively. The model also includes two
Inner Lindblad Resonances (ILRs) located at the distances
of RILRI = 0.14 and RILRO = 0.87 kpc.

Non-axisymmetric perturbations of the bar increase
slowly approaching the full strength by Tgr = 447 Myr,
which is equal to four bar rotation periods. However, the
m = 0 component of the bar is included in the model
from the beginning. During the period of the bar growth,
0 < t < Tgr, radial and azimuthal forces created by the
bar were multiplied by the factor kg which increases linearly

from 0 to 1. We also introduce the additional force, fa, which
on the contrary decreases linearly with time:

kg = t/Tgr

(

where < fb > is the radial force created by the bar aver-
aged over the azimuthal angle θ
[0, 2π]. The force < fb >
depends on the radius, R, so its values were tabulated be-
fore the simulation and then were calculated for a position
of a particle by linear interpolation. This procedure ensures
a constant average radial force at each radius during the
bar-growth period. The m = 0 component of the bar can be
interpreted as a pre-existent disc-like bulge (Athanassoula
2005).

The qt(R) quantity is often considered as the charac-
teristic of perturbations created by a bar. It is calculated
as the maximal ratio of the acceleration in the azimuthal
direction to the average acceleration in the radial direction
at a certain radius:

qt(R) = max(

).

(15)

The strength of the bar, Qb, is determined as the maxi-
mal value of qt along the radius (Sanders & Tubbs 1980;
Combes & Sanders 1981; Athanassoula et al. 1983). In the
present model the strength of the bar amounts to Qb =
0.3142, which is a typical value for galaxies with strong
bars (Block et al. 2001; Buta, Laurikainen & Salo 2004;
D´ıaz-Garc´ıa et al. 2016).

Figure 2. Variations in the velocity components, VR, VT and VZ (left panel), and in the velocity dispersions, σR, σT and σZ (right
panel), along the Galactocentric distance, R, derived from the Gaia EDR3 and Gaia DR2 data. The median velocities are calculated
in 250-pc wide bins. The vertical lines on the curves demonstrate the random errors in the determination of the velocities and velocity
dispersions. We can see (a) that the radial velocity VR reaches a maximum of +5 km s−1 at the distance of R ∼ 6 kpc and a minimum
of VR ∼ −3 km s−1 at R ∼ 8.5 kpc. Note also that the VR-proﬁle derived from the Gaia DR3 data is ﬂatter in the distance interval 4–6
kpc than the proﬁle derived from the Gaia DR2 catalogue. (c) The proﬁle of the azimuthal velocity VT demonstrates a sharp drop by
∆VT = 7 km s−1 in the distance interval R = 7.0–8.5 kpc. Noticeably lower velocities VT in the distance range 4.0–5.5 kpc can be due
to the lack of thin-disc stars in this region. (e) The vertical velocity VZ remains within ±1 km s−1 in the distance interval 6.0–9.0 kpc
but exhibits a velocity bend at the larger distances from the Sun, which can be due to the wrong distance scale. (b, d, f) The variations
in the velocity dispersions, σR, σT and σZ , with the distance R were approximated by the exponential law (the dashed lines).

with a mass of Md = 3.25 1010M⊙ and a characteristic scale
of Rd = 2.5 kpc (Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard 2016). The
total mass of the model disc and bar is Md + Mb = 4.45
×
1010M⊙, which agrees with other estimates of the Galactic-
1010 M⊙ (Shen et al.
disc mass lying in the range 3.5–5.0
2010; Fujii et al. 2019). The surface density of the disc is
determined by the relation:

Σ = Σ0 exp

− R

RD ,

(16)

where Σ0 is the density of the disc at the Galactic center.

Here we consider only the thin disc because the ratio of the
surface densities of the thick and thin discs are supposed
to be only 12 per cent at the solar distance (as a review
Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard 2016).

The classical bulge is modelled by a Plummer sphere
109 (Dehnen & Binney 1998;
with the mass of Mbg = 5

isothermal sphere. More detailed description of the construc-
tion method for each Galactic subsystem is given in Melnik
(2019).

sions, σT /σR, derived from the Gaia EDR3 data (the red dashed
line) and the model value F = κ/(2Ω) (the black line) on Galac-
tocentric distance R. The value of F determines the ratio of the
azimuthal and radial velocity dispersions adopted for the initial
distribution of model particles.

3.2 The initial velocity distribution

We suppose that 3 Gyr ago the dependence of the radial
velocity dispersion σR on the distance R in the R = 5–11
kpc interval was similar to what is observed now:

σR = C ∗

R exp

− R

SR ,

(17)

where SR is adopted to be SR = 20 kpc (Eq. 9).

We want to make sure that the model disc is sta-
ble against axisymmetric perturbations at the initial time
instant. So the value of the constant C ∗
R is determined
so as to ensure the Toomre stability parameter would be
QT > 1 throughout the disc (Toomre 1964). In our model,
QT achieves a minimum at the distance of R = 3.1 kpc, so
the constant C ∗

R is determined from the equation:

QT =

σR κ
3.36 G Σ

= 1

(18)

at the distance of R = 3.1 kpc (Fig. 4b). This normalization
yields the initial radial-velocity dispersion at the solar dis-
tance of σR = 30.5 km s−1, which is very close to the value
of σR = 31.5 km s−1 derived from the smooth distribution of
the Gaia velocity dispersions (Eq. 9). After the model bar

started growing, the velocity dispersion inside the corota-
tion radius (RCR = 4.0 kpc) increased rapidly but we want
the disc to be stable at the initial moment as well (see also
section 4.5).

Any subsystem of disc stars with a non-zero ve-
locity dispersion rotates with a smaller average veloc-
ity than the velocity of the rotation curve (for example,
Binney & Tremaine 2008). The relation between the aver-
age azimuthal velocity VT and the velocity of the rotation
curve Vc is determined by the Jeans equation:

where ρ is the volume density of disc stars and Φ is the
Galactic potential which is related to the velocity of the
rotation curve by the following expression:

V 2
c = R

∂Φ
∂R

.

(20)

Assuming that the motions along coordinates R and z are
independent, we can neglect the second term in the left part
of Eq. 19. If we suppose that the distribution law along the
coordinate z does not depend on the distance R, then we
can substitute the volume density ρ for the surface density
Σ. We assume that systematic motions are absent at the
initial moment and can make following substitutions:
R = σ2

rections:

Fig. 4(a) shows the distribution of the average az-

tric distance, R, at the initial instant. Also shown are the
velocity of the rotation curve, Vc, and the radial-velocity
dispersion, σR, at the initial moment. We can see that the
velocity VT is always slightly lower than the velocity of the
VT increases with the
rotation curve and the diﬀerence Vc
increasing distance R.

Fig. 5 shows the dependence of the ratio of the observed
velocity dispersions of disc stars, σT /σR, and the model
value F = κ/(2Ω) on Galactocentric distance R. The value
of F determines the ratio of the azimuthal and radial veloc-
ity dispersions adopted for the initial distribution of model
particles. We can see that F is almost constant and varies in
the range F = 0.70–0.72 in the distance interval 5–10 kpc,

© 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

which is quite expected for model with a ﬂat rotation curve
for which F must be equal to F = 1/√2. The formal errors
in the determination of the observed ratio σT /σR are less
than 0.01. The model value F = κ/(2Ω) is derived from the
model potential so it is absolutely accurate. We can see that
the Gaia EDR3 ratio of the velocity dispersions, σT /σR, de-
creases with increasing distance R, which can be due to the
rapid change of the velocity dispersion σT with R (Table 1).
However, in the solar neighborhood of
< 1.5 kpc,
the observed ratio σT /σR lies in the range 0.60–0.72. So here
the model and observed values of the velocity dispersions are
consistent to within 15%.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Formation of the rings

The formation of elliptical resonance rings requires some
time for the epicyclic motions of stars to adjust in accor-
dance with the rotation of the bar. Fig. 6 shows the dis-
tribution of the surface density of model particles in the
Galactic disc at diﬀerent time instants. The time t = 0 cor-
responds to the instant when the bar is turned on. By the
time Tgr = 0.45 Gyr the bar gains the full strength. One
can see that the outer rings, R1 and R2, are already formed
by the time t = 1 Gyr. The ring R1 is located closer to the
Galactic center and is stretched perpendicular to the bar so
that the bar and ring R1 are reminiscent of the Greek letter
’θ’. The ring R2 is located further away from the Galactic
center and is stretched parallel to the bar. Besides the outer
rings, R1 and R2, the Galactic disc produces the inner (r)
and nuclear (n) resonance rings.

Fig. 7(a) shows the distribution of the surface density,
Σ, of model particles along the distance R at diﬀerent time
moments. Local density minima between the following pairs
of rings: n and r, r and R1, R1 and R2, are immediately
apparent. Interestingly, the location on the OLR precisely
coincides with the density minimum.

−

Fig. 7(b) shows the distribution of the relative surface
density, ∆Σ = Σ
Σ0 + C, of model particles near the OLR.
The function Σ0 describes the exponential density distribu-
tion at the start of the simulation but the constant C = 3.2
103 kpc−2 is added to avoid dealing with negative values.
We can see some variations in the width and density of the
outer ring R2: at the times t = 2.0 and 3.0 Gyr the ring
R2 has larger width and smaller density than at the times
t = 1.5 and 1.0 Gyr, which is mainly due to the shift of
its inner boundary. Probably, here we see the periodically
strengthening and weakening ring R2.

velocity proﬁles

Melnik & Rautiainen 2009; Gonz´alez-Fern´andez et al. 2012;
Pettitt et al. 2014, and other papers). The median veloci-
ties of model particles were calculated in ∆R = 250-pc wide
bins. Model velocity proﬁles were averaged over 0.5 Gyr time
periods with a step of ∆t = 0.01 Gyr. The random errors
in the determination of the average model velocities in bins
are smaller than 0.1 km s−1. The observed velocity proﬁles
were derived from the Gaia EDR3 data (section 2).

−

Fig. 8 (left panel) shows the model and observed proﬁles
of the radial velocity VR. The model VR-proﬁles demonstrate
a plateau in the distance interval R = 5.0–6.0 kpc, a smooth
3 km s−1 over the interval
fall from the velocity VR = +5 to
R = 6.0–8.5 kpc and a slow rise or a plateau with a constant
negative velocity VR in the interval R = 8.5–10.0 kpc. We
can see that the model and observed VR-proﬁles match well
in the distance interval R = 6–9 kpc. Note that the model
proﬁles of the velocity VR obtained during the time periods
t = 0.5–1.0 and 1.0–1.5 Gyr are steeper than the proﬁles
calculated for the periods 1.5–2.0, 2.0–2.5 and 2.5–3.0 Gyr,
which can result from a small increase in the velocity dis-
persion due to the tuning of the epicyclic motions near the
OLR (i.e. to the formation of the outer rings). Generally,
the model and observed VR-proﬁles match better during the
time periods 1.5–2.0, 2.0–2.5 and 2.5–3.0 Gyr than at the
times 0.5–1.0 and 1.0–1.5 Gyr.

Fig. 8 (right panel) shows the model and observed pro-
ﬁles of the azimuthal velocity VT . The model velocity VT is
almost constant, VT = 216–218 km s−1, at the start of the
simulation (the slightly curved dashed line). The velocity VT
drops by 5 km s−1 at the distance of R = 8.5 kpc by the time
t = 1.0 Gyr. We can see that the model and observed VT -
proﬁles agree well over the distance interval R = 6.0–10.0
kpc at the time periods 1.0–1.5 and 1.5–2.0 Gyr. The model
can reproduce the sharp drop of the velocities VT in the dis-
tance interval R = 7.5–8.5 kpc just at the times 1.0–1.5 and
1.5–2.0 Gyr, but later the model velocity VT demonstrates
a smoother fall.

The study of the inﬂuence of the observational errors
and selection eﬀects onto the distributions of the velocities
VR and VT along the distance R is presented in Appendix.

4.3 Comparison of the velocity proﬁles during

diﬀerent time periods

We calculated the statistics χ2 (the sum of squared diﬀer-
ences between the model and observed velocities) to ﬁnd the
time periods during which the model and observed velocity
proﬁles agree best. The values of χ2
T are computed
in n = 17 bins in the distance interval R = 5.5–9.5 kpc for
the radial and azimuthal velocity proﬁles, respectively:

as well as in their sum χ2 = χ2

in time is ∆t = 10 Myr. We can see that the χ2
T and
χ2 functions demonstrate small oscillations about the av-
erage values, which are due to the stochastic deviations of
the velocities of model particles. The χ2 function starts its
decrease at t = 0.5 Gyr and reaches a plateau at the time 1
Gyr. The distribution of χ2 in the time period 1–3 Gyr is not
precisely ﬂat but exhibits a shallow minimum at t = 1.8 Gyr.
The location of the minimum is determined with the uncer-
tainty of

0.5 Gyr corresponding to 1σ probability level.

Fig. 10 shows the distributions of the radial and azimuthal
velocities, VR and VT , along Galactocentric distance R cal-
culated for ﬁve values of the bar angular velocity: Ωb = 40,
45, 55 and 60 km s−1 kpc−1. The position angle of the bar
is supposed to be θb = 45◦. Model velocity-proﬁles are aver-
aged for the time period of t = 1.5–2.0 Gyr. We can see that
the value of the bar angular velocity equal to Ωb = 55 km s−1
kpc−1 provides the best agreement between the model and
observed VR- and VT -velocity proﬁles. Note, that the model
velocity proﬁles computed, on the one hand, for the speeds
of Ωb = 40, 45, 50 km s−1 kpc−1 and, on the other hand, for
60 km s−1 kpc−1 are shifted with respect to the observed
proﬁles towards larger and smaller distances R, respectively.
The larger the bar angular velocity Ωb, the smaller the ra-
dius of the OLR. Fig. 10 also shows that the radial velocity
VR starts decreasing nearly at the radius of the OLR while
the azimuthal velocity VT demonstrates a slight rise just at
the distance of the OLR and starts its drop only at the dis-
tance exceeding the radius of the OLR by nearly 0.7 kpc:

locations of the resonance rings are marked by the letters: n (nuclear ring), r (inner ring), R1 and R2 (outer rings). (b) Distribution of
the relative surface density, ∆Σ = Σ − Σ0 + C, of model particles near the OLR, where Σ0 is the initial exponential density distribution
but the constant C = 3.2 103 kpc−2 is added to avoid dealing with negative values. We can see some variations in the width and density
of the outer ring R2: the ring R2 has a ﬂatter proﬁle at the times t = 2.0 and 3.0 Gyr than at the times t = 1.0 and 1.5 Gyr.

that the χ2 functions achieve minima at Ωb = 55 km s−1
kpc−1. The 1σ conﬁdence interval calculated for the time
period 1.5–2.0 Gyr is 52–57 km s−1 kpc−1. The function χ2
computed for the time period 1.5–2.0 Gyr achieves smaller
values than χ2 obtained for other periods but the diﬀerence
is close to 1σ.

The value of the bar angular velocity of Ωb = 55 km
s−1 kpc−1 corresponds to the location of the OLR of the
bar at ROLR = 7.00 kpc. The adopted value of the solar
Galactocentric distance is R0 = 7.5 kpc, so the radius of the
OLR must be shifted by 0.5 kpc towards the Galactic center
with respect to the solar circle. The uncertainty in the values
of Ωb, 52–57 km s−1 kpc−1, produces the uncertainty in the
radius of the OLR equal to 6.75–7.40 kpc and the shift of
the OLR with respect to the solar circle is determined with
the uncertainty ROLR = R0

The position angle of the bar, θb, is the angle between
the direction of the bar major axis and the Sun–Galactic
center line. Fig. 11(b) shows variations in the χ2 values av-
eraged over the time periods t = 1.0–1.5, 1.5–2.0, and 2.5–
3.0 Gyr with the position angle θb. We can see that the χ2
function built for the time period 1.5–2.0 Gyr demonstrates
a sharp drop at the interval 0–30◦ followed by a plateau with

4.5 Comparison between the model and observed

velocity dispersions

Figure 12 shows variations in the dispersions of the radial,
σR, and azimuthal, σT , velocities with the distance R calcu-
lated for the model and observed velocities. The model σR-
and σT -proﬁles are plotted with the time step of ∆t = 0.2
Gyr. We can see that the model velocity dispersions, σR and
σT , demonstrate a fast growth inside the corotation radius
R < 4.0 kpc during the ﬁrst 0.6 Gyr, after which changes
become very small. But beyond this radius, R > 4.0 kpc,
the velocity dispersions change only slightly during the en-
tire simulation time. However, we can notice a small growth
of the radial velocity dispersion, σR, near the OLR: from
the initial value of σR = 31.6 km s−1 (t = 0) to maximum
of 34.7 km s−1 at t = 1.3 Gyr and then back to 32.8 km s−1
at t = 2.5 Gyr. Probably, such small up-and-down changes
are due to the tuning of orbits near the resonance rings R1
and R2 (see discussion in Melnik 2019). Generally, the model

the main sequence of

The Gaia catalogue mainly includes F-G-K type stars
of
the Hertzsprung-Russell di-
agram (Gaia Collaboration, Babusiaux, van Leeuwen et al.
2018) among which there are stars of diﬀerent ages.
such as SDSS/APOGEE
Large
(Majewski et al. 2017), LAMOST (Zhao, Zhao, Chu et al.
2012) and GALAH (De Silva et al. 2015) give an opportu-
nity to obtain massive estimates of ages of red stars in the
Galaxy. The median ages of stars located in the Galactic-
midplane at the solar distance appear to lie in the range
2–7 Gyr. In addition, the average age of disc stars increases
towards the Galactic center (Ness at al. 2016; Frankel at al.
2019; Wu et al. 2019). The decrease of stellar ages in the
outer part of the Galactic disc is often thought to be due

© 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

to a gas accretion episode at a look-back time of 5–9 Gyr
(Spitoni et al. 2019; Lian et al. 2020). Another explanation
is connected with the emergence of the bar and the forma-
tion of the outer resonance rings near the solar circle, which
stimulates the movement of gas from the outer disc to the
solar neighborhood (Haywood et al. 2019).

We selected stars from the Gaia EDR3 catalogue with
reliable parallaxes, proper motions and line-of-sight veloci-

ties located near the Galactic plane,

median velocities in the radial and azimuthal directions, VR
and VT . The observed distributions of the velocities over the
Galactocentric distance, R, have some speciﬁc features: the
radial velocity, VR, demonstrates a smooth decrease from

Figure 10. Model and observed distributions of the radial VR (left panel) and azimuthal VT (right panel) velocities along Galactocentric
distance R. The model velocity proﬁles are calculated for the ﬁve values of the bar angular velocity: Ωb = 40 (green line), 45 (violet
line), 50 (yellow line), 55 (thick black line) and 60 (blue line) km s−1 kpc−1, and are averaged over the time period of t = 1.5–2.0 Gyr.
The observed velocity proﬁles are derived from the Gaia EDR3 data (red dashed curves). The long vertical lines indicate the locations of
the OLRs. The upper row of colored numbers displays the values of Ωb while the bottom row gives the values of ROLR. The strokes on
the curves indicate the random errors in the determination of the model median velocities in bins averaged over 50 proﬁles. The errors
in the determination of the observed velocities in bins are comparable with the line width. We can see that the bar angular velocity of
Ωb = 55 km s−1 kpc−1 provides the best agreement between the model and observed velocity proﬁles while the values of Ωb = 40–50
and 60 km s−1 kpc−1 cause the model velocity proﬁles to be shifted towards larger and smaller distances R, respectively.

±

The observed dispersion of radial velocities, σR, at the
solar distance R0 is equal to σR = 31.5 km s−1. The velocity
dispersion σR increases in the direction of the Galactic cen-
ter and its variations in the distance interval R = 5–11 kpc
can be approximated by the exponential law with a scale
length of 22

2 kpc.

We built a model of the Galaxy including bulge, bar,
disc and halo components, which reproduces the observed
speciﬁc features of the velocity proﬁles in the Galactocentric
distance interval
< 1.5 kpc. The best agreement be-
tween the model and observed velocity proﬁles corresponds
0.5 Gyr after the start of the simulation.
to the time t = 1.8
The model of the Galaxy with the bar rotating at the
angular velocity of Ωb = 55 km s−1 kpc−1 provides the best
agreement between the model and observed velocity proﬁles.
The value of Ωb = 55 km s−1 kpc−1 sets the OLR of the bar
at the distance of ROLR = R0
0.5 kpc. The 1σ conﬁdence
interval for the values of Ωb is Ωb = 52–57 km s−1 kpc−1
which corresponds to the uncertainty in the OLR location
of

0.4 kpc.

The position angle of the bar, θb, with respect to the Sun
corresponding to the best agreement between the model and
observed velocities is θb = 45◦. The 1σ conﬁdence interval
amounts to 25–60◦.

ate some bias between the true and observational veloci-
ties. To simulate observational errors we created the spacial
distribution of model particles close to the observed distri-
bution, and added normally distributed errors to the true
values of parallaxes, proper motions and line-of sight veloc-
ities. The standard deviations of model errors in parallaxes
(σ̟ = 0.016 mas), proper motions (σµ = 0.015 mas yr−1)
and line-of-sight velocities (σvr = 2.0 km s−1) are supposed
to be equal to the average values of errors given in the Gaia
< 15◦,
DR3 catalogue for the sample of stars considered:

Figure 13 (a, b) shows the distribution of the median
velocities VR and VT calculated in ∆R = 250-pc wide bins
for the true values of ̟, µ and Vr and for the values aﬀected
by observational errors. We can see that observational errors
have practically no eﬀect on the velocity proﬁles calculated
in bins at least at the distance range R = 5–10 kpc. The
average diﬀerence between the velocities calculated for the
true and observed data is 0.1 km s−1 which is comparable
to the random errors.

Figure 13 (c, d) describes the method of modelling the
observational distribution. Figure 13 (c) shows the spacial
distributions of model particles, n, in bins normalized to the
number of particles, n0, in the bin centered at the solar po-
sition (R0 = 7.5 kpc) calculated for the exponential disc
(fmod) and for Gaia DR3 stars (fobs). We can see that the
logarithmic distribution of model particles in the exponen-
tial disc (fmod) is close to the straight line while the distri-
bution of Gaia DR3 stars in our sample is bell-like-shaped
(see also Fig. 1b). To mimic the selection eﬀect we retained
all model particles in the bin centered at the solar position
and only a small fraction of particles in the bins located far
from the solar circle.

Figure 13 (d) shows the fraction, F = fmod fobs, of
model particles which must be retained in each bin to mimic
the selection eﬀect in the distribution of Gaia DR3 stars
with known line-of-sight velocities (Sartoretti et al. 2018;
Katz et al. 2019). Function F equals unity, F = 1, at the
solar position and it is less than 0.1, F < 0.1, in the bins
> 1
located farther than 1 kpc from the solar circle,
kpc. The asymmetry of function F with respect to the solar
position means that we should exclude more particles in the
direction toward the Galactic center than in the opposite
direction.

Thus, we can neglect the observational errors in our
analysis of the velocity distributions along the distance R.

Figure 13. (a, b) Inﬂuence of observational errors onto the distribution of the velocities VR (a) and VT (b) along the distance R. The
black solid lines describe the true velocity-proﬁles of model particles calculated in bins (|θ| < 15◦, |z| < 200 pc, ∆R = 250 pc) while
the red dashed lines indicate the velocity-proﬁles of model particles aﬀected by random errors in parallaxes (σ̟ = 0.016 mas), proper
motions (σµ = 0.015 mas yr−1) and line-of-sight velocities (σvr = 2.0 km s−1). We can see that observational errors have practically no
eﬀect on the velocity proﬁles in the distance interval R = 5–10 kpc. Also shown are the velocity proﬁles computed for Gaia DR3 stars. (c,
d) To study the eﬀect of observational errors we simulated the spacial distribution of model particles close to the observed distribution.
(c) Spacial distributions of model particles, n, in bins obtained for exponential discs (fmod) and for Gaia DR3 stars (fobs) normalized
at the number of particles, n0, located at the bin centered at the solar position (R0=7.5 kpc). (d) Function F = fmod fobs indicates the
fraction of model particles which must be retained in each bin to mimic the selection eﬀects in the distribution of Gaia DR3 stars with
known line-of-sight velocities. Functions fmod, fobs and F are presented in logarithmic form.
