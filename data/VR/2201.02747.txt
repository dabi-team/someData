ABSTRACT

Colors and binarity provide important constraints on the Kuiper belt forma-
tion. The cold classical objects at radial distance r = 42–47 au from the Sun are
predominantly very red (spectral slope s > 17%) and often exist as equal-size
binaries (∼ 30% observed binary fraction). This has been taken as evidence for
the in-situ formation of cold classicals. Interestingly, a small fraction (∼ 10%) of
cold classicals is less red with s < 17%, and these “blue” bodies are often found
in wide binaries. Here we study the dynamical implantation of blue binaries from
r < 42 au. We ﬁnd that they can be implanted into the cold classical belt from a
wide range of initial radial distances, but the survival of the widest blue binaries
– 2001 QW322 and 2003 UN284 – implies formation at r > 30 au. This would be
consistent with the hypothesized less-red to very-red transition at 30 < r < 40
au. For any reasonable choice of parameters (Neptune’s migration history, initial
disk proﬁle, etc.), however, our model predicts a predominance of blue singles,
rather than blue binaries, which contradicts existing observations. We suggest
that wide blue binaries formed in situ at r = 42–47 au and their color reﬂects
early formation in a protoplanetary gas disk. The predominantly VR colors of
cold classicals may be related to the production of methanol and other hydrocar-
bons during the late stages of the disk, when the temperature at 45 au dropped
to (cid:39) 20 K and carbon monoxide was hydrogenated.

Introduction

The Kuiper belt holds important clues about the Solar System formation. Neptune’s

early migration (Fern´andez & Ip 1981, Malhotra 1993), in particular, is thought to be re-

sponsible for the complex orbital distribution of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). Observations

and dynamical modeling of KBOs (see Morbidelli & Nesvorn´y (2020) and Gladman & Volk

(2021) for recent reviews) help us to understand: (i) the mass and radial structure of the

original outer disk of planetesimals, and (ii) the nature and timescale of Neptune’s migration

(e.g., Hahn & Malhotra 2005, Levison et al. 2008, Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y 2016). For ex-
ample, it is inferred that Neptune relatively slowly migrated (one e-fold (cid:38) 10 Myr, Nesvorn´y
2015a) on a modestly eccentric orbit (e ∼ 0.03–0.1; Dawson & Murray-Clay 2012, Nesvorn´y

2021). Neptune’s orbit could have been excited by a dynamical instability (Tsiganis et al.

2005, Nesvorn´y & Morbidelli 2012).

KBO colors and binarity provide crucial constraints. The color distribution of small

KBOs is bimodal with less red (LR) and very red (VR) objects observed, in diﬀerent pro-

portions, in all dynamical categories (e.g., Wong & Brown 2017). Complex organics and

surface weathering are thought to be responsible for diﬀerent colors. The VR bodies are

believed to have formed beyond an iceline of some volatile such as methanol or ammonia
(Brown et al. 2011). The exact location of the LR-to-VR transition, r∗, is unknown. The
dynamically cold KBOs at r = 42–45 au are predominantly VR which indicates r∗ < 42
au. If r∗ < 30 au, however, the dynamically hot populations such as Plutinos, hot classicals

(HCs) and scattered disk objects (SDOs) would presumably have a much larger proportion
of VR objects (Nesvorn´y et al. 2020, Ali-Dib et al. 2021). This indicates 30 < r∗ < 42 au.

Observations reveal an unusually high fraction of binaries among cold classicals (CCs;

∼ 30%, Noll et al. 2020). The CC binaries have nearly equal-size components (R2/R1 > 0.5,
where R1 and R2 are the primary and secondary radii) and wide separations (ab/(R1 +
R2) ∼ 10–1000, where ab is the binary semimajor axis). They presumably formed during
the formation of KBOs themselves, by the streaming instability (SI; Youdin & Goodman

2005) and subsequent gravitational collapse (Nesvorn´y et al. 2010, 2019). Their survival in

diﬀerent KBO categories reﬂects how much these populations were aﬀected by collisions and

dynamical processes (Petit & Mousis 2004, Parker & Kavelaars 2010). For example, only a

– 3 –

very small fraction of wide binaries is expected to survive the dynamical implantation from

r < 30 au (most become unbound during encounters to Neptune; Parker & Kavelaars 2010,

Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y 2019).

Fraser et al. (2017, 2021) reported detection of several “blue” binaries in the CC pop-

ulation (i.e., LR colored; spectral slope s < 17% as deﬁned in Fraser et al. 2017; Table 1).

This is surprising because if these binaries formed – like most CCs – beyond 42 au, they

should be VR – like most CCs. They could not have formed in the massive disk below 30

au, which is the source of most dynamically hot KBOs, presumably because they would not,

especially the wide ones, survive (Parker & Kavelaars 2010). It has been suggested (Fraser

et al. 2017, 2021) that the blue binaries formed at r ∼ 38 au, from where that were pushed –

by migrating Neptune’s 2:1 resonance – to r > 42 au. As this implantation mechanism does

not involve gravitational scattering by Neptune, binaries are retained. This interpretation
would indicate the LR-to-VR transition at r∗ (cid:39) 38–42 au.

Here we re-examine the implantation of blue binaries from r < 42 au to r > 42 au. The

best dynamical models from Nesvorn´y et al. (2020) are used to determine the implantation
probability to an orbit with the semimajor axis 42 < a < 47 au, inclination i < 5◦, and

stable perihelion distance q > 36 au. The dynamical survival of binaries during planetary

encounters is evaluated as a function of the mutual separation of binary components. We

ﬁnd that the widest blue binaries – 2001 QW322 and 2003 UN284 – would not survive if
they formed below 30 au ((cid:46) 1% survival probability). Their survival becomes progressively
more likely with the increasing starting radius: ∼10–25% for 30 < r < 36 au, ∼40–50% for

36 < r < 38 au and ∼100% for r > 38 au. We discuss the implication of these, and other

results obtained here, for blue binaries, the LR-to-VR transition in the original disk, and the

interpretation of KBO colors in general.

2. Dynamical Eﬀect of Planetary Encounters

We make use of two Kuiper belt simulations published in Nesvorn´y et al. (2020); they

are referred to as 10/30 and 30/100 here (Table 2). See that work for the description of

the integration method, planet migration, initial orbital distribution of disk planetesimals,

and comparison of the results with the orbital structure of the Kuiper belt. A shared

– 4 –

property of the selected runs is that Neptune migrates outward by scattering planetesimals.

Planetesimals are initially distributed in a disk extending from just beyond the initial orbit

of Neptune at 22 au to > 50 au. The radial distribution of planetesimals is assumed to

have a drop at (cid:39) 30 au, with the massive inner disk and low-mass outer extension, or

a smooth proﬁle with the surface density exponentially decreasing with distance. Either

of these initial distributions can match existing observational constraints (Nesvorn´y et al.

2020). The simulations were performed with the symplectic N -body integrator known as

Swift (Levison & Duncan 1994).

All encounters of planetesimals with planets were recorded. This was done by monitoring

the distance of each planetesimal from Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and recording

every instance when the distance dropped below 0.5 RHill,j, where RHill,j are the Hill radii
of planets (j = 5 to 8 from Jupiter to Neptune, the inner planets were not included). We

veriﬁed that the results do not change when more distant encounters are accounted for. The
disk planetesimals that ended up on orbits with with 42 < a < 47 au, q > 36 au and i < 5◦

at the end of the simulations (t = 4.5 Gyr) were selected and used for the analysis presented

here. See Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y (2019) for the binary survival during implantation into

the dynamically hot populations.

Each selected planetesimal was assumed to be a binary object. We considered a range
2)1/3 (Agnor & Hamilton
of binary separations, 1 < ab/Rb < 2000, where Rb = (R3
2006), initially circular orbits (binary orbit eccentricity eb = 0), and a random distribution
of binary inclinations (ib). Ten clones with diﬀerent binary inclinations were assigned to each
selected planetesimal to increase the statistic. Each binary was evolved through all recorded

1 + R3

planetary encounters. We used the Bulirsch-Stoer (B-S) N -body integrator that we adapted

from Numerical Recipes (Press et al. 1992). The center of mass of the binary was ﬁrst

integrated backward from the time of the closest approach to 3 RHill,j. It was then replaced
by the actual binary and integrated forward through the encounter until the planetocentric

distance of the binary exceeded 3 RHill,j. The ﬁnal binary orbit was used as an initial orbit
for the next encounter and the algorithm was repeated over all encounters.

The B-S code monitored collisions between binary components. If a collision occurred,

the integration was stopped and the impact speed and angle were recorded. A fraction of

binaries became unbound. For the surviving binaries, we recorded the ﬁnal values of ab,

– 5 –

eb and ib, which were then used to evaluate the overall change of orbits. The statistics of
surviving binaries was used to compute the binary survival probability, pb, as a function of
ab/Rb.

3.

Implantation Probability

Figure 1 shows the implantation probability onto an orbit with 42 < a < 47 au, i < 5◦

and q > 36 au from diﬀerent parts of the original planetesimal disk. The implantation

probability is computed as pj = nj/Nj, where Nj is the number of planetesimals starting
with rj−1 < r < rj in our simulations, and nj is the number of planetesimals starting with
rj−1 < r < rj and ending with 42 < a < 47 au, i < 5◦ and q > 36 au. Probability pj does
not account for the availability of planetesimals in diﬀerent zones. We used eight zones in

total with r0 = 24 au rj = 30 + 2(j − 1) au for j = 1, . . . , 7, and r8 = 47 au. Note that the
ﬁrst zone (j = 1) corresponds to the full radial span of the inner massive disk, here assumed

to be 6 au wide, and the eighth zone (j = 8) is the orbital radius of the cold classical disk;

all other zones are 2 au wide.

The implantation probability increases with the initial radial distance, from p2 ∼ 10−4
for r (cid:39) 31 au to p7 (cid:39) (2–3) × 10−3 for r (cid:39) 41 au. It is apparently easier to implant bodies
in the cold classical belt if they start radially closer to the belt. For the eighth zone, where

bodies already start in the CC region, p8 is the probability of survival on a CC orbit. We
ﬁnd, consistently with the previous results (Nesvorn´y 2015b), that 30-40% of planetesimals

starting in the cold classical belt survive (p8 (cid:39) 0.3–0.4). The implantation probabilities
from the massive disk below 30 au are low: p1 (cid:39) 8 × 10−5 for 10/30 and p1 (cid:39) 2 × 10−5 for
30/100. The probability proﬁle less steeply raises with the initial orbital radius if Neptune’s

migration is faster, and is practically ﬂat between 30 and 42 au for the 10/30 simulation.

We now multiply the implantation probability by the number of planetesimals initially

available in each zone, ηj. We consider two cases from Nesvorn´y et al.
truncated power-law proﬁle (the surface density Σ ∝ 1/r, truncated at 30 au), and (2)

(2020): the (1)

exponential proﬁle (Σ ∝ exp[(r − r0)/∆r]/r, where r0 denotes the inner edge radius at 24
au, and ∆r au is one e-fold, no outer truncation here). For the truncated power-law proﬁle,

the change of the surface density at r = 30 au is parametrized by the contrast parameter, c,

– 6 –

which is simply the ratio of surface densities on either side of 30 au. Here we use ∆r = 2.5

au and c = 1000. Both these cases were shown to correctly reproduce the orbital and color

distribution of KBOs (Nesvorn´y et al. 2020).

We deﬁne nCC,j = pjηj, where nCC,j represents the actual number of planetesimals
implanted onto the CC orbits from diﬀerent zones, and normalize nCC,j such that nCC,8 =
104. This means that we expect 104 planetesimals to survive in the CC region (∼ 1/3 of

the original population; Fig. 1). For comparison, Kavelaars et al. (2021) estimated from

the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS; Bannister et al. 2018) observations that

there are (cid:39)5,000–15,000 CCs with diameter D > 100 km (the range given here reﬂects the

uncertain albedo of CCs, pV = 0.05–0.2).

With the truncated power-law proﬁle, the 30–42 au region does not contribute much to

the population of CCs, for either migration run considered here (Fig. 2). In this case, we

would expect ∼ 100 bodies to be implanted from r = 30–42 au, only ∼ 1% of today’s CC

population. For the inner part of the planetesimal disk, r < 30 au, we ﬁnd nCC,1 ∼ 2500 for
10/30 and nCC,1 ∼ 800 for 30/100. This would represent ∼ 8–25% of the CC population and
imply that nearly all blue CC binaries would need to be implanted from r < 30 au. This is

diﬃcult to reconcile with observations (Fraser et al. 2017, 2021), because the wide binaries

such as 2001 QW322 and 2003 UN284 would not dynamically survive (Sect. 4; Nesvorn´y &

Vokrouhlick´y 2019). The population of blue cold classicals would be dominated by singles

in this case – the opposite to what is observed.

The results with the exponential disk proﬁle are somewhat more plausible. Here, the

contribution of the r < 30 au and 30 < r < 42 au source regions would be similar: 15–30%

in 10/30 and ∼ 6–10% in 30/100 (percentages given relative to the present CC population;

Kavelaars et al. 2021). This would also produce roughly the right proportion of LR/VR
CCs assuming that 30 < r∗ (cid:46) 40 au for 10/30 or 35 < r∗ (cid:46) 40 au for 30/100 (Nesvorn´y
et al. 2020). In the next section, we discuss the dynamical survival of binaries starting in

diﬀerent zones.

4. Binary Survival

Figure 3 shows how the survival probability changes with the starting heliocentric dis-

tance and binary separation. We ﬁnd that the binary survival depends on ab/Rb, where
2)1/3, and not on ab, R1 and R2 individually. This is a consequence of the
Rb = (R3
binary dissociation condition described in Agnor & Hamilton (2006). A binary with the total

1 + R3

mass mb = m1 + m2 can become unbound when the planetocentric Hill radius of the binary,
rHill,b = q(mb/3mpl)1/3, where q is the distance of the closest approach and mpl is the planet
mass, becomes smaller that the binary separation; that is rHill,b < ab. This condition yields

where Rpl and ρpl are the planet radius and density. Here we assumed that the primary and
secondary components of binaries have the same density, ρ. For exactly equal-size binaries
with R1 = R2, Rb = (R1 + R2)/22/3.

The encounter statistics changes with the starting heliocentric distance and this projects

into the expectation for binary survival. The survival probability is also a strong function
of the binary separation (Fig. 3).1 For the ease of presentation, we consider three types of

binaries: tight with ab/Rb ∼ 10, wide with ab/Rb ∼ 100, and extreme with ab/Rb ∼ 1000.
For reference, one tight, ﬁve wide and two extreme blue CC binaries are currently known

(Table 1).

The tight binaries with small separations are strongly bound together and have relatively

high survival probabilities, pb > 0.9 (independently of their starting orbital radius), except
for the inner disk in 10/30, for which we obtain pb,1 (cid:39) 0.85. The tight binaries are aﬀected
only during extremely close encounters to planets which do not happen too often. The wide

binaries with ab/Rb (cid:39) 100 are less likely to survive. Here the survival probability increases
from pb,1 (cid:39) 0.3 for r < 30 au to (cid:39) 0.8–1 for bodies starting near the inner edge of the cold
belt (r = 36–42 au). The extreme binaries are not expected to survive (e.g., pb (cid:39) 0.01 for

1The results shown in Fig. 3 were computed assuming the bulk density ρ = 1 g cm−3. According to Eq.
(1), the critical semimajor axis scales with ρ1/3. Therefore, the surviving fraction curve shown in Fig. 3
would shift left by a multiplication factor of 0.79 for ρ = 0.5 g cm−3 and right by a multiplication factor of
1.26 for ρ = 2.0 g cm−3. We conﬁrmed this by simulating cases with diﬀerent densities.

– 8 –

r (cid:46) 30 au) unless they start with r > 37 au. The implications of these results for blue
binaries depends on the color transition radius r∗ (Fig. 4).

In the model, we assign color to each simulated object depending on whether it started
at r < r∗ (“blue” or LR) or r > r∗ (VR). The color transition at r∗ is assumed to be a sharp

boundary between LR and VR. This can be a consequence of the sublimation-driven surface

depletion in some organic molecules, such as methanol or ammonia (Brown et al. 2011). In
this case, the color transition at r∗ would correspond to the sublimation radius (see Sect. 5

for a discussion).

The case with r∗ ∼ 30 au can be ruled out because the blue CC binaries would have to

start with r < 30 au (to have blue colors), and the great majority of wide/extreme binaries

would not dynamically survive their implantation in the CC population. The color transition

somewhere between 30 and 42 au could be more plausible. The main constrains are: (i) to

implant enough blue binaries in the cold disk, and (ii) not implant too many blue singles.

Indeed, the existing observations reveal only two blue CC singles (s < 17%; Fraser et al.

2017, 2021). To satisfy both conditions, a very large binary fraction in the source region,
r < r∗, is needed (Fraser et al. 2017). In addition, a large fraction of initial binaries starting
with r < r∗ must survive implantation; the ones that are dissolved are a source of blue

singles.

None of the options considered here seems to work to satisfy the constraints: the blue

singles always win over the wide/extreme blue binaries. This is illustrated in Fig. 4. Here we

assumed that all planetesimals are born as binaries with a ﬁxed separation. In three diﬀerent

cases, we set ab/Rb = 10, 100, and 1000. This is not meant to represent the real situation. In
reality, single planetesimals must have formed as well, and many initial binaries in the inner

massive disk should have been dissociated by impacts (Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y 2019; see

Sect. 5 below), producing singles. In addition, for any reasonable assumption about their

formation, the planetesimal binaries should have formed with a range of binary separations.

For wide binaries with ab/Rb = 100, the predicted blue-binary to blue-single number
ratio, Rb/s, is smaller than one – in direct contradiction to observations (Fraser et al. 2017,
2021; Rb/s (cid:39) 4, Table 1) – unless r∗ > 42 au (Fig. 4). This would imply that the blue
CC binaries had to form in situ at r = 42–47 au. We discuss this possibility in Sect. 5.

– 9 –

The extreme binaries with ab/Rb = 1000 are easier to dissolve, and yield much lower values
of Rb/s. The tight binaries with ab/Rb = 10 show Rb/s > 1 for any choice of the color
transition radius. This is simply because they survive and dominate the ﬁnal statistics over

singles (recall our assumption of the 100% blue binary fraction in the source).

To explain the observations that indicate the preference for blue wide/extreme binaries

over tight ones and singles (Fraser et al. 2021), it could be imagined that all planetesimals

start as tight binaries and these binaries become wider. This is not the case. In fact, only

a very few tight binaries became wide/extreme our simulations – this formation channel

is simply not eﬃcient enough. A similar result was obtained in Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y

(2019) for binaries implanted in the dynamically hot Kuiper belt populations. In a recent

paper, Stone & Kaib (2021) suggested that a small subset of tighter binaries can give rise

to a small population of very wide binaries, but their simulations show that only ∼ 1% of

initial binaries with 30 < ab/Rb < 100 can evolve to have ab/Rb > 300, with most (∼ 90%)
surviving with ab/Rb < 100. This would not help to explain the observed statistics of blue
CC binaries.

5. Discussion

We end at an impasse: no simple combination of binary properties, radial distribution

of planetesimals and color transition radius can match the constraints. Something else must

be going on. We ﬁrst discuss the inﬂuence of observational biases. An important bias that

favors detection of binaries over singles is that a binary is composed of two objects of some

size and will appear brighter than a single object of the same size (e.g., Noll et al. 2020).

For example, an exactly equal-mass binary is (cid:39) 0.75 mag brighter than a single object.

A magnitude limited survey is therefore expected to yield a higher-than-intrinsic binary

fraction.

A similar bias occurs when bodies are monitored for color measurements where the

observational target must be bright enough to measure accurate colors. For the size distri-

bution of large CCs (Fraser et al. 2014), this could contribute by a multiplication factor

of several in terms of Rb/s, and is not large enough to resolve the issue highlighted in Fig.
4. In addition, the magnitude bias does not disfavor the detection of tight binaries (and

– 10 –

unresolved tight binaries). We therefore ﬁnd that this bias cannot be entirely responsible for
the problem in question.2

In this work, we used the dynamical models from Nesvorn´y et al. (2020). While these

models were previously shown to reproduce the orbital structure of the Kuiper belt, dy-

namical modeling is a source of additional uncertainties. For example, Volk & Malhotra

(2019) showed that the mean orbital inclination of Plutionos and HCs can be obtained in a

model where Neptune migrates on a very-low-eccentricity orbit. This migration mode could

potentially have diﬀerent implications for the implantation of blue binaries (although it is

not clear, in detail, how this would work). To start with, however, it would be important to

demonstrate that the very-low-eccentricity migration of Neptune can match other constraints

as well (e.g., the inclination distribution of KBOs; see discussion in Nesvorn´y 2021).

Levison & Morbidelli (2003) proposed that CCs were pushed out from ∼ 35 au to > 42

au by the 2:1 resonance with migrating Neptune. To maintain low eccentricities in this

migration model, the resonant population was required to be massive (the total mass of

several Earth masses). As bodies in the 2:1 resonance do not experience encounters with
Neptune, this would favour binary survival. Moreover, if r∗ > 35 au, the implanted binaries

would be blue, potentially resolving some of the tensions discussed above. On the down

side, with several Earth masses in the 2:1 resonance, the collisional grinding in the resonant

population would presumably be intense, casting doubt on the collisional survival of wide

binaries.

It is also not clear whether a very massive 2:1 population is plausible (modern

dynamical models do not place much mass beyond 30 au; e.g., Levison et al. 2008, Volk &

Malhotra 2019, Nesvorn´y et al. 2020).

Additional uncertainty is related to the initial inclination distribution of planetesimals.

In Nesvorn´y et al. (2020), we adopted the Rayleigh distribution to set up the initial inclina-
tions. For r < 30 au, the mean inclination was set to (cid:104)i(cid:105) = 0.06 (3.5◦). For r > 30 au, the
mean inclination gradually decreased with the orbital radius such that (cid:104)i(cid:105) (cid:39) 1.7◦ for r = 45

au, a value comparable with the free inclination of cold classicals (Fraser et al. 2021). It

is not known what the real inclination distribution was or how it varied with the orbital

observations. This bias would favor detection of blue binaries (relative to VR binaries).

radius. It is possible, for example, that the initial inclination distribution was wider (e.g.,

because bodies starting in the massive planetesimal disk have their inclinations excited by

large objects that formed in the disk; Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y 2016) and more strongly

If so, we imagine that the implantation probability from
varied with the orbital radius.
r (cid:46) 35 au to 42 < a < 47 au, i < 5◦ and q > 36 au would be reduced – relative to our
nominal model – because fewer bodies could reach orbits with very low inclinations. This

would then presumably shift the balance toward having more CCs implanted from larger

orbital radii, where the binary survival is better, increase Rb/s, and potentially improve the
match to observations. This is left for future work.

It is also conceivable that the wide/extreme blue binaries were not implanted in the CC
population but instead formed in situ at r = 42–47 au.3 If that would be the case, however,

we would need to explain why their LR colors diﬀer from the predominantly VR colors of

CCs. The time of formation could potentially be responsible for the color diﬀerence. KBOs

presumably formed by the streaming instability (Youdin & Goodman 2005), or a related

process, in a protoplanetary gas disk. During the early stages, when the protoplanetary

disk was massive and the solar luminosity was high (Baraﬀe et al. 1998), the surface layers

of a ﬂared disk at 45 au were heated by solar radiation and the radiation was eﬃciently

diﬀused to the disk midplane. The midplane temperature at r = 45 au is therefore expected

to be relatively high (Bitsch et al. 2015). As the disk becomes less massive over time and

the solar luminosity decreases, the temperature is expected to drop. For example, in some

disk models, the midplane temperature at 45 au changes from above 30 K during the early

stages to below 20 K during the late stages (e.g., Bitsch et al. 2015). This would cause

carbon monoxide (CO), which is the second most important gas molecule in astronomical

environments, to freeze.

The CO iceline near 45 au would have two important implications for the formation of

CC planetesimals. First, the surface density of solids would be boosted near 45 au, includ-

ing the contribution from the cold ﬁnger eﬀect (Drazkowska & Alibert 2017). This could

3Fraser et al. (2021) suggested that the blue CC binaries may have slightly broader inclination distribution
than the rest of the CC population. If conﬁrmed, this would be a telltale signature of them being implanted.
The statistics, with only several known blue CC binaries, did not allow Fraser et al. to establish this result

potentially produce, if grains stick and grow to become large enough (Birnstiel et al. 2016),

favorable conditions for the streaming instability (Carrera et al. 2015, Yang et al. 2017,

Li & Youdin 2021). Second, for temperatures below 30 K, CO can be destroyed on grains

(chemistry mediated by cosmic ray ionization), producing CO2, CH3OH (methanol), and
other hydrocarbons (e.g., Bosman et al. 2018), all of which have relatively high sublima-

tion temperatures and can remain on a surface. Methanol, in particular, has been the only

ice unambiguously detected on the surface of Arrokoth (Grundy et al. 2020) – providing

evidence for hydrogenation of CO, possibly already on the surface of Arrokoth, but before
the gas disk dispersal.4 Methanol is known to retain high albedo and redder colors after

irradiation (Brunetto et al. 2006), possibly the main reason behind the higher albedos and

redder colors of CCs (Tegler & Romanishin 2000, Brucker et al. 2009).

Blue CC binaries could have formed in situ at 45 au during the earlier protoplanetary

disk stages when the ambient disk temperature at 45 au was higher, CO remained in the gas

phase and/or the production of CH3OH was ineﬃcient for T > 30 K (Bosman et al. 2018).
This would lead to diﬀerent chemistry and diﬀerent composition of planetesimals formed

under these conditions. The early-formed planetesimals would subsequently be exposed to

physical conditions in a late-stage protoplanetary disk (e.g., very low temperatures), and

could accrete a thin layer of methanol-rich materials (see above). This layer would have to

be later disturbed (e.g., by small impacts) to expose the interior materials. Our hypothesis

could potentially explain the color aﬃnity of blue CC binaries to KBOs in the dynamically

hot populations, which formed below 30 au and also experienced higher temperatures during

their formation.

The model can incorporate, after the gas disk dispersal, the implantation of bodies from

r < 42 au to the CC population: the majority of implanted bodies would be tight binaries

and singles (Sect. 4). A large fraction of the implanted population – those bodies that formed

earlier and/or closer to the Sun – would have LR colors. The two blue singles reported in

Fraser et al. (2021) could have formed in-situ or been implanted. They represent ∼ 2% of

the total CC sample with known colors (Fraser et al. 2021). This fraction can be used to

4The average surface temperature of Arrokoth increased to (cid:39) 40 K after the gas disk dispersal, causing

rapid surface and sub-surface depletion of CO and other super-volatiles (Brown et al. 2011).

place an upper bound on the implantation process. For example, we expect ∼10% of the
CC population to have LR colors in the 30/100 case (for any r∗ > 30 au, in a size-limited

sample; Fig. 2). This seems excessive but note that the LR/VR ratio is inﬂuenced by the

magnitude (see above) and albedo biases (LR objects generally have lower albedos than VR

objects), both of which disfavor the detection of blue singles in the CC population (relatively

to red binaries). It is therefore possible that the LR/VR ratio in the CC population is higher

than the magnitude-limited color surveys currently indicate.

6. Conclusions

Fraser et al. (2017, 2021) observationally characterized colors and binarity in the cold

classical population of the Kuiper belt. They reported detection of eight CC binaries with

LR colors (spectral slope s < 17%), most of which have very wide separations (7 of 8 have
ab/Rb (cid:38) 100), and two blue singles (possibly unresolved binaries). The LR (or “blue”)
binaries were suggested to have been implanted in the CC population from r < 42 au. Here

we studied the implantation process and found:

1. The implantation probability increases with the increasing orbital radius of the source.
For r < 30 au, it is (cid:39) 10−4 for fast Neptune’s migration (run 10/30) and (cid:39) 2.5 × 10−5
for slow migration (30/100). For r (cid:38) 38 au, the implantation probability raises to
(cid:38) 10−3.

2. Our dynamical model indicates that ∼10% of cold classicals should have LR colors as
these bodies were implanted onto CC orbits (42 < a < 47 au, i < 5◦ and q > 36 au)
from below the color transition in the original planetesimal disk (this assumes r∗ > 30

au; Nesvorn´y et al. 2020).

3. The blue binaries can be implanted from a wide range of initial heliocentric distances,

but the survival of the widest binaries implies formation at r > 30 au.

4. For any reasonable choice of parameters (Neptune’s migration history, initial disk pro-

ﬁle, etc.), the implantation model predicts a predominance of blue singles, rather than

blue binaries, which contradicts existing observations.

– 14 –

We propose that wide blue binaries formed in situ at r = 42–47 au and their color reﬂects

early formation and higher temperature of the young protoplanetary disk. The predom-

inantly VR colors of cold classicals are linked to the production of methanol and other

hydrocarbons during the late stages of the disk, when the temperature at 45 au dropped to

(cid:39) 20 K and carbon monoxide was hydrogenated. Methanol, which is known to retain high

albedo and redder colors after irradiation, was detected on the surface of Arrokoth.

Table 1: The blue CC binaries with spectral slope s < 17% as deﬁned in Fraser et al. (2017,
2021). The values reported here are a mixed bag of varied-quality data. For some binaries,
such as 2001 QW322 (Petit et al. 2008), we have a detailed information about the mutual
orbit. For others, such as 2015 RJ277, the physical radii are assumed, and the next to the last
column gives the component separation observed at the present epoch (not the semimajor
axis). Fraser et al. (2021) also reported the detection of two blue singles with s < 17% –
1999 QE4 and 2013 GR136. The observed ratio of blue binaries to blue singles is therefore
Rb/s (cid:39) 4.

Neptune’s migration is grainy with these objects as needed to explain the observed proportion
