Abstract

Extra-large massive multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems is a new concept, where

spatial non-stationarities allow activate a high number of user equipments (UEs). This paper focuses

on a grant-based random access (RA) approach in the novel XL-MIMO channel scenarios. Modiﬁ-

cations in the classical Strongest User Collision Resolution (SUCRe) protocol have been aggregated

to explore the visibility regions (VRs) overlapping in XL-MIMO. The proposed grant-based RA

protocol takes advantage of this new degree of freedom for improving the number of access attempts

and accepted UEs. As a result, the proposed grant-based protocol for XL-MIMO systems is capable

of reducing latency in the pilot allocation step.

I. INTRODUCTION

As stated by the METIS (mobile enablers twenty-twenty society) project [1], there is a predicted

rapidly increase in the demand of network access and data trafﬁc for the next few years coming. To

enable such requirement the ﬁfth generation of wireless networks (5G) is expected to provide three

main services: enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low-Latency Communication

(URLLC) and massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC). Another awaited scenario is crowded

Mobile Broadband (cMMB), where the number of UEs surpasses those of available pilot sequences

and very high data rate is demanding.

Channel state information (CSI) is necessary to provide coherent communication and this is imple-

mented by using orthogonal pilots. However, the number of UEs in crowded scenarios is much greater

than the available pilot sequences, causing an unfeasible situation to schedule. There are different

methods of RA, which can be classiﬁed in two types: random access to pilots (RAP) and random

access to pilots and data transmission (RAPiD) [2]. The second approach is a grant-free RA and uses

pilot hopping in multiple time slot transmissions, managing pilot collisions and interference with

massive MIMO (mMIMO) properties [3], [4].

This paper focuses in RAP, a grant-based RA; herein the transmissions happen in an RA pilot

domain and several UEs are trying to acquire a dedicated pilot for a collision free connection. A

promising protocol to handle many sporadic access attempts is the SUCRe [5]. In general, it resolves

RA pilot collisions, in a totally distributed way, choosing the strongest colliding user and it is well

settled in a crowded mMIMO system.

Since mMIMO is already an essential enabler for 5G networks, in [6] ﬁve challenges for this

technique have been discussed. One of them is to establish how the several conventional mMIMO

approaches will be structured in extra large arrays. These arrays can be implemented under several

types of infrastructures, as buildings, stadiums, or shopping malls, where UEs are mainly placed near

the panels generating non-stationary VRs.

The paper contribution consists in proposing a grant-based RA protocol to operate advantageously

in XL-MIMO systems, in which the large array size and the proximity with the users give rise to

spatial non-stationarities across the array. In such conﬁguration, it is possible to take advantage of

UEs distinct VRs as an additional degree of freedom in order to improve the system performance

while reducing the latency in the pilot allocation step.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

For simplicity, our adopted XL-array is a uniform linear array (ULA, Fig. 1), operating in time-

division-duplexing (TDD). Since channel modeling is not the focus of this work, it is assumed a

simpliﬁed bipartite graph model in XL-MIMO, as the one used in [7]. Accordingly, the system is

divided into B subarrays (SAs), each composed by a ﬁxed number of Mb = M/B antennas. Let

which represents the overall channel gain over the visible SAs for k-th UE. Notice that the number

of antennas per SA, Mb, does not always remain large, since VRs represent just a portion of antennas

available for each user in a speciﬁc time. Nevertheless, the proposed protocol, named SUCRe-XL,

still presents a satisfying performance even under certain reduced number of antennas per SA.

III. PROPOSED SUCRE-XL PROTOCOL

We ﬁrst describe how a straightforward adaptation of the conventional SUCRe protocol to the XL-

MIMO scenario would be, demonstrating why it does not work. Then, we propose the SUCRe-XL

protocol deploying modiﬁcations to operate in the XL-MIMO regime in step 2. The section concludes

with the deﬁnition of the contention resolution rules and allocation strategy for the dedicated payload

pilots.

BS, the bth SA receives signal Y(b)

Notice that the magnitude αt received at the BS, as in eq. (10), cannot be mathematically separated,

due to the sum of different denominators. Since the users cannot obtain this information, the appli-

cation of the strongest user criterion becomes difﬁcult. For this reason, the following SUCRe for

It is proved that changing the precoding as in eq. (15) and adapting the

αt,k estimator as in eq. (19)

are sufﬁcient to implement the proposed RA protocol in XL-MIMO scenarios. Such procedure does

not cause any additional overhead or sum rate loss in comparison with the original SUCRe protocol

[5].

Step 3: Contention Resolution and Pilot Repetition. To resolve contentions distributively and unco-

ordinately, the k-th UE now has

where δ is an adjustable scale factor for ﬁnding a suitable operation point. As in [5], we adopt a

There are four possible cases in a contention process: i. Non-overlapping UEs win (false positive).

Ex.: from Fig. 2 users 1 and 3 win. ii. Only one UE wins. iii. None of the UEs win (false negative).

iv. Overlapping UEs win (false positive). Ex.: from Fig. 2, users 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 win. Although

case 1 is a false positive, there is no pilot collision. Therefore, cases 1 and 2 are successful attempts

and there is the allocation of the RA pilot. Case 4 is considered a pilot collision; i.e., a pilot collision

occurs if more than one UE in

t retransmit in step 3 and have overlapping VRs.

S

Step 4: Allocation of Dedicated Payload Pilots After the BS receives the repeated UL pilot trans-

missions from step 3, it tries to decode the message with new channel estimates from the repeated

pilots. If the decoding goes well, the BS can allocate pilot sequences in the payload data blocks to

the non-overlapping contention winners, followed by a replying DL message informing the successful

connection and, if necessary, more information. If the decoding fails, the protocol failed to resolve

that collision and the unsuccessful UE is instructed to try again after a random interval.

SUCRe-XL Complexity is equivalent to that of conventional SUCRe protocol. Although the computa-

tion of the precoding vector increases marginally at the BS with the number of SAs B, due to the sum

of all different estimated channels in (15), the same precoding vector is used for all SAs, different

than the precoding in (11) for the original SUCRe. While the original SUCRe has to compute B

different vector inner products in (11), the proposed SUCRe-XL protocol has to compute a sum of B

vectors followed by a single vector inner product in (15). Also, each UE k

t,

∀

∈ S

t has to estimate

the sum of its large scale fading coefﬁcients in SUCRe-XL protocol, which can be evaluated as the

average received power of a beacon signal in a step 0, similarly as assumed in [5].

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

It is assumed a 100 meter ULA with M = 500 antennas in a 200

200 m2 square cell with

×

K = 1000 uniformly distributed iUEs (crowded scenario) as illustrated in Fig. 1, each user wants

to become active with probability Pa = 0.01. It is considered τp = 10 pilots, and transmit powers

ρk = q = 1W,
(1), with R(b)

k. Two channel models were deployed: i) uncorrelated Rayleigh fading, as in eq.

∀

k = IMb; ii) correlated Rayleigh fading model, following eq. (2), with r = 0.7.
A baseline ALOHA-like performance has been included for comparison purpose, which treats pilot

collision by retransmission after a random waiting time period, hence, contending users retransmit

their pilots at random if collision occurs.

The Probability to Resolve Collision (PRC) is calculated numerically taking all resolved collisions

per total number of collisions occurred. Simulations were carried out in sequential RA blocks fashion,

where iUEs try to access the channel in each iteration. For each parameter value of the x-axis (B or

Pb in Fig. 3), it is simulated 104 sequential RA blocks. If an attempt fails, UE makes another attempt

with probability 0.5 in the subsequent blocks. It is given a limit of 10 RA attempts per UE, after

which a failed access attempt is declared.

hardening and favourable propagation effects, as well as the quality of the bαt,k estimates and, consequently, the PRC.
Channel correlation highlights this effect, making the PRC starts to decrease with a lower B value.

when probability Pb decreases, improving the SUCRe-XL PRC for B = 20, as well for the Baseline

performance. However, this could not be seen for the SUCRe-XL for B = 5, since the effect of the

1 turns to intervene more frequently, breaking the trend of the

presented result in increasing the PRC with the decrease of Pb, as expected according to the Pno

expression. Besides, this does not occur for B = 1 (stationary case), since the only SA existent is the

entire linear array. Furthermore, the Baseline success probability grows abruptly comparing with the

proposed protocol with Pb reduction. This behavior might come from non-overlapping cases, when

the decision rule would be unnecessary: the Baseline recognizes non-overlapping pilot collisions as

successful attempts, while UEs in the SUCRe-XL protocol still have to decide to repeat the RA pilot,

even when they are not overlapping.

Average Number of Access Attempts. Numerical results in Fig. 4(a) shows the average number of RA

attempts as a function of the number of iUEs. The fraction of UEs that could not access the network,

i.e., the portion that is unsuccessful in the maximum number of 10 RA attempts, is illustrated in Fig.

4(b). There is a clear advantage of SUCRe-XL in reducing the failed access attempts when exploiting

the channel non-stationarities, supporting a higher number of UEs.

Fig. 5(a) depicts the average number of accepted UEs per resolved collision (ξ), showing that

ξ remains around one with increasing number of subarrays. Although ξ is slightly higher for the

Baseline scheme, the resolved collisions are much rarer in this simple scheme, as in Fig. 3(a). In

the same scenario, Fig. 5(b) indicates the normalized number of accepted UEs (λ) that realized

successful attempts. Hence, in average, the total number of admitted UEs along the 104 RA blocks

is given by Λ = λ

104. Indeed, non-stationary cases surpasses the stationary one, specially

in (over)crowded mMTC scenarios, being able to manage a greater number of UEs.

V. CONCLUSION

Grant-based RA operating under massive antennas has demonstrated satisfactory performance to

handle multiple access attempts under (over)crowded scenarios, typically present in cMMB. Further-

more, XL-MIMO is a promising concept to surpass the performance of classical antenna structures.

Hence, to take advantage of channel non-stationarities, an adapted SUCRe protocol for XL-MIMO

follows E[|Vk|] = B · Pb.

active UEs, since it attains a reduced fraction of failed access attempts and reduces access latency.

For simplicity, let ρi be the same for all i; then we have:
