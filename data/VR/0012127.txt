1. Introduction

The Bethe-Salpeter formalism [1] is generally accepted, in principle, as the appropri-

ate framework for the description of bound states within a (relativistic) quantum
ﬁeld theory. Unfortunately, almost all applications of this formalism face serious

problems of both conceptual and practical nature. In particular, it turns out to
be a highly nontrivial task to extract exact information about the solutions. Con-

sequently, one is led to consider some reasonable simpliﬁcations of the full Bethe-
Salpeter equation, such as the following: the elimination of any dependence on time-

like variables by the use of a static or instantaneous approximation to the interaction
kernel, leading to the ‘Salpeter equation’ [2]; the neglect of the spin degrees of free-
dom of the bound-state constituents; and the restriction to positive-energy solutions.

With these constraints one arrives at the ‘spinless Salpeter equation’, which may
be regarded as a straightforward generalization of the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger

formalism towards relativistic kinematics: it describes the bound states of scalar
particles as well as the spin-averaged spectra of the bound states of fermions.

In this paper we study the Salpeter Hamiltonian

H = β

m2 + p2 + vr2

(1.1)

p

in which β > 0 is a parameter (allowing, for example, for more than one particle),
m is the mass, and vr2 is the harmonic-oscillator potential with coupling v > 0.
In the momentum-space representation [3-7] the operator p becomes a c-variable
m2 + p2 + vr2
and thus, from the spectral point of view, the Hamiltonian H = β
is equivalent to the Schr¨odinger operator

given by

p

H

=

H

v∆ + V (r), V (r) = β

−

m2 + r2.

(1.2)

Since the potential V (r) in (1.2) increases without bound, we know [8] that the
is entirely discrete, and we denote its eigenvalues (also
spectrum of the operator

p

the eigenvalues of H ) by

H

Enℓ(v, β, m), n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , ℓ = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
where n ‘counts’ the radial states in each angular-momentum subspace, labelled
by ℓ. Because V (r) is at once a concave function of r2 and a convex function of
r, this allows us to derive in Sec. 2 the approximation formula

which, for suitable values of P, provides both upper and lower bounds to the energy.

2. The energy bounds

If we think of the potential V (r) as a smooth transformation V (r) = g(sgn(q)rq)
of a pure attractive power potential sgn(q)rq, then the potential V (r) clearly has
two such representations, each with deﬁnite convexity. That is to say, we may write

the potential in the following way:

V (r) = β

m2 + r2 = g(1)(r2) = g(2)(r),

(2.1)

p

where the two transformation functions g have the properties that g(1) is concave
( g′′ < 0 ) and g(2) = V is convex ( g′′ > 0 ). These are precisely the conditions
under which our ‘envelope theory’ [9-11] applies. The tangent lines to the transfor-

mation functions g are, on the one hand, shifted oscillator potentials of the form
a+br2, and, on the other, shifted linear potentials of the form a+br. The potential
V (r) itself is at once the envelope of an upper oscillator family and a lower linear
family of potentials. It follows [11] that we may write

(2.2)

where the ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ P numbers are deﬁned in terms of the correspond-
ing exact power eigenvalues E as follows. Suppose the exact eigenvalues of the

∆ + sgn(q)rq, q
Schr¨odinger operator for the pure-power potential
written Enℓ(q), then the corresponding P numbers are deﬁned [11] by

(2.3)

The limiting case q

another story [12]. Thus we have for the harmonic-oscillator potential ( q = 2 )

which are listed here in Table 1. Thus we have established the principal claim of this

paper. The minimizations in (2.2) can be carried out exactly, yielding the following
quartic equation for r2 :

r8 =

4v2P 4
β2

(m2 + r2).

(2.6)

However, given the ease of contemporary computing, the minimizations in (2.2)

are perhaps preferable to the exact analytical solutions to (2.6); moreover, (2.2) in-
volves meaningful semi-classical energy expressions which exhibit clearly the kinetic

and potential energy contributions and how they depend on the parameters of the
problem. It turns out that these energy bounds are quantitatively equivalent to the
bounds obtained in the Appendix of Reference [7] by the use of optimized opera-

tor inequalities. The present formulation of the energy bounds, based on convexity,
allows for the uniform and succinct expression of our upper and lower results by

Eq. (2.2), and admits further natural generalizations.

As an illustration of the accuracy of (2.2) we have plotted graphs of the ap-

proximate eigenvalues given by (2.2) in Fig. 1. We illustrate the case β = v = 1 and
plot the eigenvalue bounds obtained as functions of the mass m. Corresponding
accurate numerical eigenvalues are shown as a dashed curve between each pair of

bound curves. These graphs conﬁrm numerically what is immediately clear directly
approaches
from the operator H, that the corresponding (Schr¨odinger) problem

H

the oscillator for large m, and the linear potential for small m.

3. Conclusion

The spinless-Salpeter eigenvalue problem is not easy to solve. Even for the harmonic-

oscillator potential, one obtains an equivalent Schr¨odinger problem with the poten-
tial V (r) = β√m2 + r2 that does not admit exact analytical solutions in terms of
known special functions. Thus, even for the oscillator problem, we must resort to

approximations of some sort. The potential V (r) increases monotonically to inﬁn-
ity and we therefore know a priori that the spectrum is entirely discrete. Hence,
the spectrum and wave functions can be found numerically with considerable ease.
In spite of this, it is always desirable to have an eigenvalue formula, even an ap-
proximate one, which tells us how the spectrum depends on all the parameters of
the problem. In this paper we have used geometrical envelope theory to generate

simple semi-classical expressions that provide upper and lower bounds to all the
eigenvalues.
