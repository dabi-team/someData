We describe photonic crystal microcavities with very strong light-matter interaction to real-
ize room-temperature, equilibrium, exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). This is
achieved through a careful balance between strong light-trapping in a photonic band gap (PBG)
and large exciton density enabled by a multiple quantum-well (QW) structure with moderate di-
electric constant. This enables the formation of long-lived, dense 10 µm - 1 cm scale cloud of
exciton-polaritons with vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS) that is roughly 7% of the bare exciton recom-
bination energy. We introduce a woodpile photonic crystal made of Cd0.6Mg0.4Te with a 3D PBG
of 9.2% (gap to central frequency ratio) that strongly focuses a planar guided optical ﬁeld on CdTe
QWs in the cavity. For 3 nm QWs with 5 nm barrier width the exciton-photon coupling can be
as large as ~Ω =55 meV (i.e., vacuum Rabi splitting 2~Ω =110 meV). The exciton recombination
energy of 1.65 eV corresponds to an optical wavelength of 750 nm. For N =106 QWs embedded
in the cavity the collective exciton-photon coupling per QW, ~Ω/√N = 5.4 meV, is much larger
than state-of-the-art value of 3.3 meV, for CdTe Fabry-P´erot microcavity. The maximum BEC
temperature is limited by the depth of the dispersion minimum for the lower polariton branch, over
−5m0 where m0 is the electron mass in vac-
which the polariton has a small eﬀective mass
∼
uum. By detuning the bare exciton recombination energy above the planar guided optical mode, a
larger dispersion depth is achieved, enabling room-temperature BEC. The BEC transition temper-

3.5 nm is the exciton Bohr radius and the exciton-cavity detuning is increased to 30 meV. A
high quality PBG can suppress exciton radiative decay and enhance the polariton lifetime to beyond

INTRODUCTION

Semiconductor microcavities oﬀer an unique platform
to study fundamental phenomena of quantum electrody-
namics in the strong coupling regime[1–3]. Thanks to
advances in growth and manipulation technologies, both
excitons and cavity photons are tunable in a variety of
ways which enable observations of novel phenomena[3–
5]. In the last decade non-equilibrium exciton-polariton
BEC have been observed in 1D Fabry-P´erot microcavi-
ties in various materials[4–9]. However, polariton lifetime
is often too short to achieve thermal equilibrium BEC.
Moreover, the BEC temperature is limited by the weak-
ness of photon conﬁnement and the resulting insuﬃcient
exciton-photon coupling strength.

In an optical cavity, an atomic excitation and a pho-
ton may couple together to form a coherent superposition
when their decay rates (times ~) are much smaller than
their coupling. In a semiconductor microcavity[1–3], ex-
citons and photons constitute polaritons in this man-
ner. The quantum superposition of excitons and pho-
tons confers them with remarkable dynamics. For in-
stance, the polariton eﬀective mass, inherited from the
10 times the mass of Rubid-
cavity photon, is about 10−
ium atom. Consequently, the BEC transition tempera-
ture of polariton gases is usually above 1 K. In the last
decade signatures of non-equilibrium polariton BEC has
been reported in semiconductor microcavities[4–9]. Al-
though aspects of macroscopic coherence and superﬂu-

idity have been observed/claimed[6, 10–13], the polari-
ton lifetime has been too short (about 1 ps) to achieve
genuine thermal equilibrium[14]. Recently high-quality-
factor Fabry-P´erot microcavities have provided longer
polariton lifetime[15]. Nevertheless, polaritons can ra-
diatively decay into extraneous and degenerate optical
modes of these 1D periodic structures from a micron-
scale conﬁnement region.

Due to the half-photon and half-exciton nature of
the polariton, the Bose condensate contains polariton-
polariton interactions (i.e., optical non-linearity). Such a
nonlinear, coherent light source has potential application
as a laser with low excitation threshold and novel pho-
ton statistics[6, 7, 16–18]. Nonlinearity can also be ex-
ploited for the development of all-optical transistors[19],
diodes[20], and switches[21, 22]. Unfortunately, most re-
alizations of polariton BEC have been at cryogenic tem-
peratures. Above room-temperature polariton BEC[23]
is essential for broad practical applications. While stud-
ies on GaN[24], ZnO[25, 26], and organic materials[27]
have found room-temperature polariton light emission
and lasing, these are not suﬃciently long-lived for equilib-
rium BEC. These room temperature eﬀects are facilitated
by large exciton binding energy Eb and exciton-photon
coupling ~Ω. With small exciton Bohr radius aB, the sat-
2 at which electron-hole pairs
uration density
unbind due to many-body eﬀects (screening and phase-
space ﬁlling as revealed in Ref. [28]) is likewise very high
in these materials. On the other hand, small excitons

(5aB)−

are very sensitive to local disorder. This leads to strong
inhomogeneous broadening that smears the exciton and
polariton dispersion. The inhomogeneous broadening in
the polymer material measured from optical spectroscopy
in Ref. [27] is as high as 60 meV while the exciton-
photon coupling is ~Ω =58 meV. The inhomogeneous
broadening in GaN and ZnO are around 16 meV[29]
and 25 meV[30], respectively, while the exciton-photon
coupling are 25 meV[31] and 29 meV[32], respectively.
In contrast the inhomogeneous broadening in GaAs and
CdTe is around 1 meV[33]. Nevertheless the exciton-
polariton lifetime is still below 1 ps[26] in these materials
due to the nature of the optical cavity utilized. Recently,
macroscopic occupation of photonic states in microcavi-
ties ﬁlled with dye molecules has been observed at room
temperature[34, 35]. This quasi-condensate[36] in the
weak-coupling regime exhibits strongly ﬂuctuating pho-
ton number[35], unlike BEC of polaritons in the strong-
coupling regime with conserved particle number[4].

In this article, we introduce an alternative approach,
using 3D PBG[37, 38] based microcavities[39–41] to
greatly enhance the exciton-photon coupling and elim-
inate radiative decay of polaritons. We focus on CdTe
based photonic crystal microcavities since these oﬀer an
eﬀective balance between strong light conﬁnement and
high exciton density. The exciton binding energy in CdTe
QWs has been measured to be about 20 meV (vary-
ing with QW width, temperature, etc)[42–44] leading to
an exciton Bohr radius aB about 4 nm. An exciton-
photon coupling of ~Ω = 13 meV has been experimen-
tally realized in CdTe based Fabry-P´erot microcavities
with N =16 QWs[8]. These data indicate that neither
the exciton binding energy nor the exciton-photon cou-
pling in CdTe structures is greater than room temper-
ature kBT = 26 meV. Bare excitons in CdTe QWs are
not stable at room temperature and the polariton BEC
temperature is below room temperature in Fabry-P´erot
microcavities. Indeed non-equilibrium polariton BEC in
a CdTe based Fabry-P´erot microcavity is only 19 K[8].
On the other hand, the refractive index of CdTe is suﬃ-
cient for much stronger light-trapping in the form of 3D
PBG. Here we show that using a PBG architecture, the
photonic ﬁeld is much more strongly focused on suitably
placed QWs. Consequently, the exciton-photon coupling
is enhanced beyond 50 meV (i.e., vacuum Rabi splitting
beyond 100 meV). This stabilizes the exciton-polariton
and enables equilibrium BEC above room temperature.
For excitons in CdTe multiple QWs (MQWs) with
width 3 nm and barrier width 5 nm, the exciton recombi-
nation energy is 1.65 eV (optical wavelength 750 nm) and
the exciton binding energy is calculated by the eﬀective
mass approximation[45] to be 23 meV (larger than the
9 meV in GaAs QW of the same width[46]). The exciton
Bohr radius of 3.5 nm is likewise smaller than the cor-
responding radius in GaAs (8.4 nm)[46], but larger than
in ZnO (1.4 nm) and GaN (2.8 nm)[47]. These prop-
erties of CdTe lead to stronger coupling, higher satura-
tion density, and stronger thermal stability of excitons

between QWs is ﬁxed to be 5 nm. QWs are made of CdTe
(dielectric constant 8.5) while the barriers and photonic crys-

photon coupling strength and the on-resonance lower polari-
ton dispersion depth is 48 meV. Larger dispersion depth and
higher BEC temperature is achieved by detuning the exciton
recombination energy above the lowest 2D guided mode.

compared to GaAs. CdTe is nevertheless suitable for
high quality microcavities for which growth technology
is well-developed[3, 43]. CdTe has a dielectric constant
of 8.5[43, 48, 49] above the threshold for PBG formation.
We propose to use Cd0.6Mg0.4Te as the barriers between
QWs as well as for the background photonic crystal. The
dielectric constant of Cd0.6Mg0.4Te is 7.5[50]. This gives
a photonic band gap (PBG) in the woodpile architec-
ture (see Fig. 1) of δω/ωc = 9.2% (δω denotes band gap
width and ωc is the PBG central frequency). The di-
electric constant of the regions with MQWs is taken to
be 8, which is the average value of the QW and bar-
rier materials. Using N =106 QWs, the exciton-photon
coupling is as large as ~Ω = 55 meV, i.e., the vacuum
Rabi-splitting is 110 meV. The exciton-photon coupling
per QW of ~Ω/√N = 5.4 meV is considerably larger
than 13/√16 = 3.3 meV for the Fabry-P´erot microcav-
ity reported in Ref. [8] (i.e., exciton-photon coupling of
13 meV for 16 QWs). We also calculate the exciton-
photon coupling when the number of QWs in each rod
is reduced by increasing the barrier width (keeping two
QWs in the central slab). The exciton-photon coupling is
45 meV if the barrier width is increased to 10 nm while
there are 7 QWs in each rod in the active region (to-
tal of 58 QWs). When the barrier width is increased to
20 nm with 4 QWs in each rod in the active region (to-
tal 34 QWs), the exciton-photon coupling is 40 meV. If
there are only two QWs in the central slab and no QW in
the rods, the exciton-photon coupling remains as high as
33 meV. All these energies are greater than room temper-
ature kBT = 26 meV and (with positive detuning of the
exciton recombination energy from the lowest 2D guided
mode) are shown below to support room-temperature po-
lariton BEC.

been demonstrated[40] that a layer of rods with MQWs
(grown by molecular beam epitaxy and etched) can be
placed in a woodpile photonic crystal. By repeated wafer-
fusion, laser-assisted alignment, careful etching and pol-
ishing (monitored by thin-ﬁlm interference), sandwich
structures can be fabricated with high precision. Accu-
rate fabrication of GaAs woodpile photonic crystals with
a near-infrared, MQW, light-emitting layer was reported
by Noda et al.[40]. Similar techniques can, in princi-
ple, be employed for our proposed CdTe photonic crystal
structure.

3D photonic crystal microcavities have been fabricated
with much higher quality factor than their counterpart
Fabry-P´erot microcavities. Quality factors as high as
106 have been demonstrated experimentally for mi-
2
crocavities in the woodpile architecture[53]. In addition,
3D PBG eliminates purely radiative recombination of ex-
citons into unwanted modes when the lower polariton en-
ergy is in the PBG. In this case, the polariton lifetime is
determined by exciton non-radiative recombination. In
CdTe QWs at room temperature, the exciton photolumi-

nescence decay time is measured to be 150 ps in Ref. [54],
suggesting that the non-radiative recombination time is
even longer. This time scale is suﬃcient for polaritons
to reach thermal equilibrium since the exciton–optical-
phonon scattering in CdTe at room temperature is quite
eﬃcient[55]. Our calculation reveals that room temper-
ature equilibrium polariton BEC can be achieved for a

the lowest 2D guided mode and the excitons are trapped
in a box with side length of 10-104 µm. Realization of
equilibrium polariton BEC at and above room tempera-
ture may open the door to broad applications of quantum
mechanics beyond the microscopic scale.

tonic crystal heterostructure. The distance between the
nearest neighbor rods in the same layer is denoted by a,
the height of each rod is h = 0.3a, the width of each
rod is w = 0.25a, and the thickness of the solid cen-
tral slab is b = 0.06a. In order to place the lowest 2D

of 750 nm[56]. MQWs are grown in the slab and the
eight layers of rods close to the slab. The other re-
gions above and below are the cladding woodpile pho-
tonic crystals. The QWs are made of CdTe, while the
barrier layers between QWs are made of Cd0.6Mg0.4Te.

semiconductor region and 0 when ~r is in the air region.
Θ(~r) describes the overlap between the photonic ﬁeld and
the excitonic wavefunction. The integration in Eq. (3) is
over the unit cell (u.c.) of the structure in the x-y plane.

It is suﬃcient to use only the spectrum close to the
energy minima of the lowest conﬁned photonic band to
calculate the dispersion of the lower polariton branch (see
Figs. 1d and 2b). This branch is essential for the study
of polariton BEC. There are two energy minima for the
photon: one at ~Q(x) = ( π
a ).
We consider the situation when the exciton recombina-
tion energy EX0 is close to the two energy minima. The
photonic dispersion around the two minima is approxi-
mately parabolic,

Here b~q corresponds to the mode that couples most
strongly to the lowest 2D guided mode in the PBG. Other
excitonic modes orthogonal to this mode (in the Hilbert
space of excitonic states spanning all QWs) are much
more weakly coupled to the 2D photonic bands. In the
above equations, the photonic band index i is omitted
since only the lowest conﬁned 2D photonic band is rel-
evant. We also approximate the ~q dependence of the
collective coupling by its value at the two polariton en-
~Ω ~Q(x) = ~Ω ~Q(y) . This is

The above dispersion can likewise be extended to the
whole 2D wavevector space since away from the energy
minima ~Q(x) and ~Q(y), the dispersion of the lower polari-
ton becomes exciton-like (i.e., almost ﬂat dispersion).

III. VERY STRONG LIGHT-MATTER
INTERACTION

Fig. 3a shows the collective exciton-photon coupling
~Ω calculated for diﬀerent QW width when excitons are
in resonance with the lowest 2D guided mode for photons,
i.e., EX0 = ~ω0. The vacuum Rabi splitting, 2~Ω, ex-
ceeds 100 meV when the QW width is 3 nm (experimen-
tally accessible as shown by Refs. [64, 65]). The width of
the barrier layers between QWs is ﬁxed at 5 nm through-
out this work. Fig. 3b depicts how the photonic crystal
lattice constant a must be adjusted as the QW width is
varied, in order to maintain resonance between the exci-
ton recombination energy and the 2D guided mode. The
total number of QWs that ﬁt into the active region is
correspondingly adjusted. Fig. 3c depicts the variation
of the exciton binding energy and Bohr radius with QW
width. The calculated exciton binding energies, ranging

∼

from 17 meV to 23 meV, agree well with experimental
results of 17

25 meV[42–44].

Considerable enhancement of the exciton-photon cou-
pling in our photonic crystal microcavity (compared with
Fabry-P´erot microcavities) originates from the light-
trapping eﬀect of the PBG. In Fig. 3d we compare

tion of z, but averaged over the x-y plane for the
Cd0.4Mg0.6Te/Cd0.8Mn0.2Te Fabry-P´erot and the 3D
photonic crystal microcavities with the same photon en-
ergy. The photonic crystal microcavity clearly focuses
the electric ﬁeld much more strongly than the Fabry-
P´erot. Moreover the averaged electric ﬁeld intensity at
z = 0 is signiﬁcant larger. This is because in photonic
crystal a large volume fraction (
75%) is air, which re-
duces the over all dielectric constant of the structure.
The reduced screening enhances the averaged electric
2 at z = 0 by eight times. Another
ﬁeld intensity
important advantage of the PBG heterostructure are the
strong spatial variations of the ﬁeld intensity in the x-y
plane. The higher intensity regions act as an attractive
“optical potential” for the exciton and the wavefunction
of the lower polariton is peaked in these “hot spots”.
This oﬀers a way to “pattern” the polariton condensates
in the x-y plane (see Fig. 3e). The peak intensity in
the x-y plane is greater than the average intensity de-
picted in Fig. 3d. This provides further enhancement
in exciton-photon coupling compared to the 1D Fabry-
P´erot geometry for which the ﬁeld intensity is uniform
in the x-y plane. From Figs. 3d and 3e the peak inten-
sity is about 38 times (the average intensity is 16 times)
as large as that in the Fabry-P´erot microcavity. Other
photonic crystals that have a larger PBG, such as the
slanted-pore photonic crystals[66], provide even stronger
light focusing and larger exciton-photon couplings than
we have presented here using the woodpile architecture.
Another advantage of PBG light-trapping is that the
quality factor of the microcavity can be very high. A
106 with nanosecond photonic life-
quality factor of 2
time has been experimentally demonstrated in the wood-
pile architecture[53]. This quality factor can be fur-
ther enhanced by simply increasing the thickness of the
cladding photonic crystal. Our calculation indicates that
moderate fabrication imperfection does not reduce the
quality factor considerably due to the existence of the
3D PBG [see the end of next section]. When radiative
decay is strongly inhibited, polaritons can decay through
slower non-radiative processes. The Auger recombina-
3 second [see Ap-
tion rate[67] is estimated as about 10−
pendix]. Non-radiative recombination triggered by elec-
tronic impurity states such as the Shockley-Read-Hall
mechanism[68], may be more important in polariton de-
cay. Nevertheless, the measured photoluminescence de-
cay time of 150 ps in CdTe QW at room temperature[54]
suggests that non-radiative polariton decay time should
be longer than 150 ps. The non-radiative exciton decay
time is believed to be on the order of nanoseconds[4].
Clearly, very strong exciton-photon coupling, long po-

lariton lifetime, and small polariton eﬀective mass are
possible in the photonic crystal microcavity.

IV. ROOM TEMPERATURE POLARITON BEC

In this section we delineate the precise conditions for
room temperature polariton BEC in our photonic crys-
tal microcavity. The BEC transition temperature is very
sensitive to the dispersion depth of the lower polariton
branch and the density of polaritons, but relatively insen-
sitive to the polariton trapping area over a broad range
of lengths, D, from 10 µm to 1 cm, when the polariton
density is high. The polariton density can be controlled
by excitation of electron-hole pairs with energy above the
upper 3D photonic band edge. These carriers can then
relax into the lower polariton branch within the PBG.
Since the polariton lifetime is enhanced beyond the ther-
malization time (on the order of ps at room temperature),
polaritons achieve thermal equilibrium long before they
decay. We consider a ﬁnite-sized trap with box (square
well potential) conﬁnement in the x-y plane. This square
quantum box has a side length of D. Such a box can be
created by replacing our inﬁnite central slab by a ﬁnite-
sized slab[40, 53, 69] or by increasing the Mg fraction
outside the prescribed box region[70] to create a barrier
for excitons. Trapping by these means enables higher
BEC transition temperature than harmonic trapping po-
tentials induced by strain[18]. The trapping box induces
quantization of the polariton wavevector in x and y di-
rections, discretizing the polariton spectra, and enabling
the BEC phase transition that would otherwise be for-
bidden in an inﬁnite 2D system. To simplify the calcula-
tion we approximate the polariton eﬀective mass with the

isotropic “density-of-states mass” mdos =

m(x)

x m(y)
x .

q

In Figs. 4a and 4b, we plot the ground state occupa-
tion N0 as a function of the polariton density. The polari-
ton distribution is calculated assuming a non-interacting,
equilibrium polariton gas. There is a rapid increase of
N0 around a threshold density, above which N0 becomes
comparable with the total polariton number Ntot. We
deﬁne the polariton BEC transition according to the cri-
terion N0/Ntot = 0.1[71] This criterion gives lower esti-
mate of the BEC transition temperature than the crite-
rion employed by Ketterle and van Druten[72]. At low
temperatures, polaritons are mainly distributed in the
low energy, photon-like states around the bottom of the
lower polariton branch with very small eﬀective mass (see
Fig. 4c). The small eﬀective mass enhances condensation
and reduces the threshold density for polariton BEC. The
dispersion depth of these photon-like states is

FIG. 4. Polariton population on ground state and other low
energy states for exciton box trap with D = 10 µm, exciton-
photon coupling of ~Ω =48 meV, and exciton recombination
energy of EX0 = 1.59 eV. The QW width is 4 nm and the
barrier layer width is 5 nm. The detuning is ∆ = 30 meV for
(a) and ∆ = 40 meV for (b). (a) Population of the ground
state (GS) vs. polariton density (solid curve). The rapid,
nonlinear increase of GS population indicates the BEC tran-
sition. The GS population fraction (dashed curve) i.e. GS
population divided by the total population is of order unity
for densities beyond the BEC transition. (b) GS population
fraction (dashed curves) and the population fraction on the
low energy discrete states (solid curves) below the continuum
exciton recombination energy EX0 (there are more than 1000
such states). These are photon-like states with very small ef-
fective mass, whereas states higher than EX0 are exciton-like.
When a large population fraction resides in the photon-like
states, the BEC threshold density is reduced. For T = 100 K
(blue curves), populated polariton states are mostly photon-
like. The threshold density is much lower than for T = 300 K
(brown curves) where the population fraction on low energy
states is negligible. (c) The dispersion of polaritons (red solid

energy, exciton-like states is signiﬁcant. The eﬀective
mass of the bare exciton is around four orders of mag-
nitude larger than the 2D guided photon eﬀective mass.
Likewise the density of exciton-like states is about four
orders of magnitude larger than the low-energy, photon-
like states. The consequences of this are indicated in
Figs. 4a (low temperature case) and 4b (high temperature
case). Polariton BEC at temperatures comparable with
V /kB require very high polariton density. Since the po-
lariton is a quantum superposition of a photon and an ex-
citon, the polariton density cannot exceed a speciﬁc “sat-
uration density”, beyond which exciton-exciton interac-
tion cause considerable exciton ionization. Therefore, the
polariton BEC transition temperature is essentially lim-
ited by the dispersion depth V . The dispersion depth is
increased by a positive detuning ∆ (see Fig. 4d). How-
ever, the excitonic fraction of the polariton is reduced
with increasing ∆. This reduces the phonon-polariton
and polariton-polariton interactions and consequently it
takes longer time for polaritons to reach their thermal
equilibrium. From experimental measurements[55] the
phonon-polariton scattering time at room temperature is
estimated to be about 0.1 ps [see Appendix]. A thermal-
ization time on the order of 1 ps is possible if the exciton
In the range of detuning
fraction is higher than 10%.
considered in this article, 0 < ∆ < 40 meV, the excitonic
fraction is greater than 19% for exciton-photon coupling
as low as ~Ω = 25 meV. Both the excitonic fraction and
the eﬀective mass of the lower polariton dispersion min-
imum decrease with detuning ∆ as shown in the inset of
Fig. 4c and in Fig. 4d, respectively.

103 µm−

We calculate the polariton BEC transition tempera-
ture Tc for various QW widths, exciton trap sizes, de-
tunings, and exciton-photon couplings for ﬁxed polariton
density. The results are plotted in Fig. 5. Clearly, room
temperature polariton BEC is attainable at overall po-
2. This is well below the
lariton density & 3
×
2 where aB is
saturation density in each QW of (5aB)−
the exciton Bohr radius. The transition temperature is
higher for smaller QW width since a larger number of
QWs can be used. It is likewise higher for larger exciton-
photon coupling and positive detuning. This is consis-
tent with the picture that Tc is limited by the dispersion
depth V . For large trap sizes D
10 µm, Tc decreases
as expected from the Mermin-Wagner theorem[73] that
forbids ﬁnite temperature BEC in an inﬁnite 2D system.
However, this decrease is very slow and little degrada-
tion in Tc is seen over the range of 10 µm < D < 1 cm.
Interestingly the exciton trap size dependence of Tc for
smaller D is nonmonotonic: Tc has a peak value around
a box size D
5 µm. When the exciton trap size is
suﬃciently small, the quantization energy of the cavity
(e.g., the energy diﬀerence between the ﬁrst excited state
and the ground state) can be comparable or larger than
the dispersion depth V . The condensation then crosses
over from polariton-like to exciton-like. Since the exciton
eﬀective mass is much larger than that of polariton, the
transition temperature is rapidly reduced.

The polariton density used in our calculation is experi-
mentally accessible. For MQWs the total exciton density
is distributed among the QWs and the excitonic frac-
tion in each QW of a polariton may be much less than
unity. For example, using N = 100 QWs, each of width
4 nm and barrier width 5 nm (i.e., ~ω0 = 1.56 eV and
EX0 = 1.59 eV with a = 365 nm and aB = 3.8 nm),
the collective exciton-photon coupling is 48 meV. For
a detuning of ∆ = 30 meV, the largest excitonic frac-
tion in any single QW is 5.5% [the exciton fraction varies
among QWs since the exciton-photon coupling for each
QW is diﬀerent, see Eq. (3)]. For total polariton den-
2, the exciton density in each QW is
sity 1.5
2 where aB is the exciton Bohr ra-
no larger than (9aB)−
dius. This single QW exciton density is less than the
saturation density[28, 44]

Systematic dependence of the BEC transition tempera-
ture on total polariton density is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a
reveals that the exciton trap size dependence of Tc is
much more pronounced at low polariton density where
the transition temperature is much smaller than V /kB.
Here most polaritons are low energy photon-like states
with very small eﬀective mass. The transition tempera-

For (d), the detuning is ∆ = 0. The dashed curve in (d)
depicts the value of δEX0 itself for reference.

ture at ﬁxed density is limited mainly by the level spacing
between the ground and ﬁrst excited state[18, 72], which
depends sensitively on the exciton trap size. In contrast,
at high polariton density, the transition temperature is
close to V /kB. When the dispersion depth V is the main
factor limiting Tc, the exciton trap size has marginal in-
ﬂuence. Figs. 6b and 6c reveal that large detuning and/or
exciton-photon coupling is favorable for room tempera-
ture polariton BEC because both of them enhance the
dispersion depth V (see Fig. 4d).

Finally we discuss the eﬀect of fabrication disorder.
This can randomize sensitive parameters such a s the
detuning ∆ and the collective exciton-photon coupling
~Ω. We show that the former eﬀect is more signiﬁcant.
Photonic disorder arises from ﬂuctuation of the shape
and size of the rods and slabs constituting the photonic
crystal. Electronic disorder arises from impurities, dis-
locations, (local) QW width ﬂuctuation, random strains,
etc. In addition to these forms of inhomogeneous broad-
ening, dynamic ﬂuctuations (homogeneous broadening)
arise from phonon-polariton and polariton-polariton in-
teractions. These are particularly important at high tem-
peratures.

Plane wave expansion calculation indicates that the 2D
photonic band edge varies by less than 2% of its value if

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the fabrication error is smaller than 20 nm for woodpile
rods outside the active region, less than 12 nm for rods
in the active woodpile region, and less than 6 nm for the
central slab thickness. The eﬀect of electronic disorder
has been studied earlier[62] for the single QW case, where
it was found that polaritons remain robust due to their
small eﬀective mass and highly mobile half-photon na-
ture. Electronic scale disorder is largely averaged out in
a scenario similar to motional narrowing[62].

~2q2

For the MQW structures studied here, there are also
ﬂuctuations of exciton energy among QWs due to vari-
ations in QW width or lateral conﬁnement of the rods.
This broadening is modeled by adding a random energy
δEl to the exciton dispersion in the l-th QW, E(l)
X (~q) =
EX0 +
+ δEl. δEl is modeled as a Gaussian random
variable with variance (δEX0)2. The eﬀects of this disor-
der on vacuum Rabi splitting 2~Ω and polariton disper-
sion depth V are presented in Fig. 6d. The calculation is
performed by averaging over 105 random conﬁgurations.
The standard deviation of the vacuum Rabi splitting is
very small due to the collective nature of the polariton.
The ﬂuctuation in polariton energy consists of sum of
random exciton energy variations from each of the N
QWs. The total eﬀect is an average eﬀect which has
a much smaller variance according to the central limit
theorem[46], δΩ
.

The ﬂuctuation of the polariton dispersion depth V
is approximately the same as the inhomogeneous broad-
ening of the exciton, δEX0. The randomization of the
detuning ∆ directly aﬀects this dispersion depth [see
Eq. (8)]. This eﬀect is much more signiﬁcant than the
ﬂuctuation of the vacuum Rabi splitting 2~Ω. Exper-
imental measurements in a single CdTe/CdMgTe QW
give a typical inhomogeneous broadening of 1 meV[33].
Hence intra-QW inhomogeneous broadening can be ren-
dered small with present-day fabrication capabilities.
Inter-QW inhomogeneous broadening estimated from lat-
eral conﬁnement diﬀerence for QWs in rods and in the
central slab is less than 1 meV as well.

Finally, dynamic ﬂuctuations (such as polariton-
phonon and polariton-polariton scattering) cause both
homogeneous broadening and relaxation of polaritons.
The latter is crucial for polaritons to reach the ground
state and achieve thermal equilibrium BEC. However,
homogeneous broadening reduces the polariton disper-
sion depth V and consequently Tc.
In CdTe QWs, at
room temperature, experiments[55] suggest a homoge-
neous linewidth of Γ = 22 meV [see Appendix]. The
broadening of the cavity photon is negligible for high

geneous broadening by adding an imaginary part, iΓ, to
the exciton energy, the VRS at zero detuning (∆ = 0) is
Γ2/4[63]. More importantly, the

In general, exciton-phonon interaction reduces the dis-
persion depth V . However, for ∆ = 30 meV, ~Ω =
48 meV, and Γ = 22 meV, the lower polariton disper-
sion depth is reduced by only 1.1 meV. This is equiva-
lent to a reduction of detuning by 2 meV and has negli-
gible eﬀects on the transition temperature according to
Fig. 6b. These results suggest that our very strongly cou-
pled exciton-photon system can withstand considerable
homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening and still
deliver equilibrium room temperature polariton BEC.

V. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have identiﬁed a CdTe-based photonic
band gap architecture with a range of diﬀerent quantum
well embeddings that are predicted to support room tem-
perature (or higher) equilibrium Bose-Einstein conden-
sation of exciton-polaritons. The most crucial factors in
enabling high temperature BEC are the dispersion depth
of the lower polariton branch and the total areal density
of long-lived excitons within the trapping region. The
dispersion depth is determined by the collective exciton-
photon coupling strength and is enhanced by detuning
the bare exciton recombination energy above the lower
edge of a slow-light, 2D guided photonic band within the
larger 3D photonic band gap. The 3D PBG enables con-
siderably stronger light trapping than conventional 1D
Fabry-P´erot microcavities, leading to stronger exciton-
photon coupling. The collective exciton-phonon coupling
strength is further enhanced by embedding up to about
100 quantum wells in the photonic crystal regions ad-
jacent to a central slab region containing two principal
quantum wells. Positive detuning of the exciton recom-
bination energy relative to the strongly-coupled photon
mode is made possible by the 3D PBG. The positively
detuned exciton remains within the 3D PBG and it can-
not decay radiatively into extraneous optical modes that
leave the system.

The total areal density of excitons is enhanced by dis-
tributing them over a large number of quantum wells that
are all strongly coupled to the 2D guided mode within
the 3D PBG. The use of CdTe-based architectures of-
fers a suitable balance between photonic and electronic
properties. The relatively low dielectric constant of CdTe
compared to other popular materials (such as GaAs) en-
ables a small exciton Bohr radius and higher saturation
exciton density. Nevertheless, the dielectric constant is
suﬃciently large to facilitate a 3D PBG that encompasses
the lower polariton dispersion depth and provides strong
3D light conﬁnement.

Our calculations of the BEC transition temperature
are based on a non-interacting polariton gas conﬁned

in a 2D box trap. Previous studies[18] have shown
that a slight reduction in the BEC transition, together
with polariton anti-bunching eﬀects are expected when
exciton-exciton interactions are included in the micro-
scopic Hamiltonian. While a box trap of 5 µm side length
is predicted to yield the highest BEC transition tem-
perature, very little degradation of Tc is seen for box
dimensions up to 1 cm when polariton density is high.
This suggests that BEC may be observable in a ﬁnite-size
photonic crystal up to centimeter-scale lateral dimension,
without recourse to a separately engineered 2D trap.

It is signiﬁcant that for total polariton densities ap-
2, the exciton density per quantum
proaching 104 µm−
2, where aB is the exciton
well remains below (10aB)−
Bohr radius. At these densities, our PBG architecture
provides suﬃciently strong exciton-photon coupling and
polariton dispersion depth to provide a predicted BEC
transition as high as 500 K,
in the absence of addi-
tional homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening ef-
fects. This oﬀers a safe margin for the realization of room
temperature BEC in realistic systems with both fore-
seen and unforeseen fabrication imperfections, exciton-
phonon scattering processes and other damping eﬀects.
In this way, the photonic band gap architecture provides
a realistic prospect of bringing the magic of macroscopic
quantum mechanics to the realm of everyday experience.

Appendix A: Calculation Methods and Details

The spectrum and wavefunction of the photonic bands
are calculated by solving the Maxwell equations using
the plane wave expansion method[60]. In calculating the
photonic bands in Cd0.4Mg0.6Te/Cd0.8Mn0.2Te Fabry-
P´erot cavity the dielectric constants for Cd0.4Mg0.6Te is
7.0 (linear interpolation between the dielectric constant
of CdTe, 8.5[49], and that of MgTe, 6.0[50]) while the
dielectric constant of Cd0.8Mn0.2Te is 7.8[74]. The elec-
tronic structures are calculated using the eﬀective mass
approximation[45]. The eﬀective mass of the electron is
me = 0.095m0 with m0 being the bare electron mass in
vacuum[58]. For the [001]-grown QWs concerned in this
work, the heavy-hole eﬀective mass along the growth di-
rection is 0.6m0[75], while the eﬀective mass in the QW
plane is mh = 0.4m0[48]. The energy and wavefunctions
of the electron and hole subbands are calculated using a
ﬁnite-depth well model[45]. The electronic band gap of
CdTe is Eg =1.475 eV[58, 76], while the electronic band
gap for MgTe is 3.49 eV[77]. Linear interpolation yields
the band gap of Cd0.6Mg0.4Te as 2.28 eV. The band gap

10

diﬀerence between Cd0.6Mg0.4Te and CdTe is 0.8 eV. The
oﬀset for the conduction band between those two materi-
als is 70% of their band gap diﬀerence[78]. The interband
dipole matrix element is given by

d =

e~√Ecv
Eg√2m0

,

(A1)

where Ecv = 2P 2
cv/m0 is the energy related to the mo-
mentum matrix element, Pcv, between the conduction
and valence bands. From Ref. [78] we take Ecv = 21 eV.
Material parameters in the above are taken for room tem-
perature.

The exciton spectrum and wavefunctions are calcu-
lated by diagonalizing the exciton Hamiltonian. For our
narrow QWs, we consider only the excitons formed by
electrons and holes in their lowest subband[43]. We ig-
nore the mixing with higher subbands and diagonalize
the exciton Hamiltonian within the lowest subband nu-
merically. This calculation yields an exciton binding
energy comparable to the experimentally observed one.
The exciton wave amplitude
and exciton Bohr ra-
dius are also obtained, using the same considerations.

The Auger recombination time, τA, is estimated us-
ing the method presented in Ref. [67]. For a volume
3 (volume density of excitons
exciton density of 1017cm−
corresponding to an areal polariton density of 104µm−
2,
estimated by dividing the areal polariton density by the
3 sec-
thickness of the active region) in CdTe, τA
ond. This very small Auger recombination rate is due
to the large band gap and small carrier density. An-
other non-radiative decay mechanisms is the Shockley-
Read-Hall mechanism due to electronic trapping centers
within the semiconductor band gap. However, experi-
ments in high quality CdTe QWs have shown photolumi-
nescence decay time of 150 ps at room temperature[54].
This places a lower bound on the non-radiative decay
time.

1] where ELO = 21.3 meV is the
LO-phonon energy[58] and the parameter ALO = 15 meV
is ﬁtted from the measured temperature dependence of
the exciton line width in Ref. [55]. Using this result, we
estimate the exciton line width due to LO-phonon scat-
tering at T = 300 K is 22 meV. This suggests a polariton
line width at zero detuning (∆ = 0) of 11 meV (exciton
fraction of polariton is 50%) and corresponds to a sub-
picosecond thermalization time. For positive detuning, if
the exciton fraction in the polariton remains larger than
10%, then the thermalization time is below or around
1 picosecond. This is considerably smaller than the non-
radiative decay time of polariton, and suggests that the
polariton gas has suﬃcient time to reach thermal equi-
librium.
