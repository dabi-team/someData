Abstract. In order to understand the evolutionary status
of the anomalous supergiant UU Her, the prototype of the
class of variable supergiants located at high galactic lati-
tudes, we obtained several high-resolution spectra of this
star, with the 6m telescope, over 5 years. This material
was used for a search of possible temporal variations of the
radial velocity at the diﬀerent depths in the photosphere
and for studying the chemical composition. The average
radial velocity Vr ≈ 130 km/s suggests that UU Her be-
longs to the old population of the Galaxy. No systematic
dependence of the velocity on depth of the line formation
layer or on ionization and excitation potential is observed.
The radial velocity of the Hα absorption diﬀers strongly
from the average photospheric velocity.

The iron abundance in the photosphere of UU Her is
signiﬁcantly lower than that of the Sun: [Fe/H] = −1.32.
The enhancement of nitrogen relatively to iron content
[N/Fe]⊙ = 0.40 in combination with the carbon under-
abundance [C/Fe]⊙ = −0.30 suggests that only a ﬁrst
dredge-up episode occurred. The Na content is normal rel-
atively to iron, therefore there is no evidence for dredging-
up of Ne-Na cycle products. The heavy s-process metals Y,
Ba are depleted relative to H and Fe, which again implies
that the third dredge-up did not occur.

From the high luminosity (log g ≈ 1), the large radial
velocity and the chemical abundance pattern, we conclude
that UU Her is a low-mass halo star, but not a post-AGB
star.

Key words: stars: abundances – stars: AGB and post-
AGB – stars: individual: UU Her

1. Introduction

In this paper, we study the characteristics of the peculiar
supergiant UU Her, which was proposed as the prototype
of a new class of variable stars by Sasselov (1984). Despite
several photometric and spectral investigations carried out

during last decade, the nature of the UU Her type stars is
not understood yet. We ﬁrst summarize brieﬂy the main
characteristics of these stars.

The UU Her-type stars are supergiants (MK-classes
Ia+, Ia, Ib) that are located at high galactic latitudes.
Besides their location in the Galaxy, which is peculiar for
supergiants, these stars have other properties which distin-
guish these objects from the normal massive supergiants
of the galactic disc. In particular, they display both spec-
troscopic and photometric variability of small amplitude
and with long periods, that undergo speciﬁc changes. They
have large spatial velocities, typical for population II, and,
as a rule, an infrared excess caused by a circumstellar dust
envelope. If the UU Her stars are truly massive stars, their
existence may point to recent star formation at high lati-
tudes in the Galaxy.

There is observational evidence for high-velocity clouds
at high latitudes with masses and density which may be
suﬃcient for massive star formation (see, for example, the
review by Van Woerden (1993)). We therefore cannot apri-
ori reject the hypothesis that UU Her is a massive super-
giant. Moreover, the double-mode photometric behaviour
that is observed for this object is in an agreement with
the high-mass hypothesis (Zsoldos & Sasselov 1992).

On the other hand, low-mass stars in advanced stages
of evolution (the AGB and post-AGB stages) also attain
very high luminosities that are provided by nuclear burn-
ing in the hydrogen and helium layers. Such a low-mass
hypothesis for the high-latitude supergiants was proposed
by (Luck & Bond 1984, Bond et al 1984) and is supported
by the low metallicity of several studied UU Her-type
stars and related objects (Bond & Luck 1987, Klochkova
& Panchuk 1988a, 1988b, 1989, 1993; Luck et al, 1990;
Waelkens et al, 1991, 1992; Klochkova 1995).

A useful test of these hypotheses is provided by the
determination of the abundances of the chemical elements
that take a part in nuclear processes in the course of stel-
lar evolution. In the case of massive supergiants, we may
expect a metallicity near the solar one, but changes in
the abundances of the CNO and some α − process ele-
ments, such as a Na excess. The latter has been observed
for several massive yellow supergiants in the Galaxy and

was explained (Denissenkov & Ivanov 1987, Denissenkov
1988) as a product of a Ne-Na cycle. In the case of low
mass stars in the AGB and post-AGB stages, the main
peculiarities of the chemical composition would be low
metallicity, changes of the CNO elements, and an excess
of heavy chemical elements that owe their origin to the
s-process.

For understanding the nature of the UU Her type stars,
it may also be important to obtain information about ra-
dial velocities and their behavior during a long time inter-
val and at the diﬀerent layers of the stellar atmosphere.
Such data could be helpful to deﬁne more reliably the
type of variability and to understand the mechanism of
variability.

The prototype UU Her has been classiﬁed F5Ib in
the MK system (Lopez-Gruz & Garrison 1993) and has
the galactic latitude b = 41◦. In contrast to other high-
latitude supergiants, UU Her does not display the in-
frared excess which is typical for stars in a post-AGB
stage of evolution (Trams et al. 1991). Spectrophotometric
(Cardelli 1989) and spectroscopic (Klochkova & Panchuk
1989) observations of the UU Her show that the metallicity
of this star is signiﬁcantly subsolar and the log g value is
the same as for yellow supergiants. Formally using calibra-
tion Mv − log g which has been derived by Klochkova &
Panchuk (1988b) for massive high luminosity stars, leads
us to the value Mv = −8m for UU Her. Such a luminos-
ity is too high for a post-AGB star and contradicts to
the low intensity of the well known luminosity indicator,
which is the triplet OI 7773 ˚A (see Fig.1). A low value log g
in combination with a low metallicity lead us to suggest a
post-AGB evolutionary stage. However, no ﬁrm conclusion
could be drawn, because the expected excesses of s-process
elements were not found.

In this paper, we present the results of new spectro-
scopic study of the luminosity, chemical composition and
radial velocities of UU Her. We were able to obtain CCD
spectra in the spectral range λ5000 − 7000 ˚A with suﬃ-
ciently high resolution for this purpose, using the echelle
spectrometer LYNX of the 6-m telescope (Panchuk et al.
1993). These observations allow us in particular to study
the CNO abundances.

2. Observations

Five CCD-spectra were obtained with the echelle-
spectrometer LYNX attached at
the Nasmyth-focus
of the 6-m telescope and equipped with a 530x580
CCD (Panchuk et al. 1993). The spectral resolution is
δλ = 0.26 ˚A in the red wavelengths region. The main char-
acteristics of the spectra are summarized in Table 1. A
Th-Ar lamp was used for the wavelength calibration; the
precision is better than 0.01 ˚A. The hot fast rotating star
HR 4687 was observed in order to identify telluric lines and
to separate these lines from the stellar ones. The echelle
CCD images were corrected for bias and background. For

these procedures and for the transformation of an echelle
image into a one-dimensional spectrum, we used the ESO-
MIDAS system. The equivalent widths for most spectral
lines were measured by ﬁtting a Gaussian to the observed
using proﬁle DECH-package by Galazutdinov (1992).

In order to increase the time base of our observations,
we also reconsidered the two photographic spectra of the
UU Her, which were obtained by Klochkova and Panchuk
with the Main Stellar Spectrograph of the 6-m telescope
and were used earlier (Klochkova, Panchuk 1989) for the
calculation of the abundances of several chemical elements
in the atmosphere of UU Her. The spectral resolution of
these photograpic spectra amounts to δλ = 0.35 ˚A.

3. Radial-velocity measurements

The photograpic spectrograms were measured with an
oscilloscopic comparator. For the velocity determination
from the CCD spectra, an identical procedure of matching
the direct and mirrored proﬁles after reduction was used
(Galazutdinov 1992). In the case of the photographic spec-
trograms independent measurements were made for sev-
eral spectral regions with a length of 100 − 200 ˚A long; in
the case of the echelle-spectra velocities were determined
for every of the 32 orders, with a length of 60 − 80 ˚A. The
wavelength calibration was performed with a Th-Ar lamp
and checked with the telluric O2 and H2O lines. The typ-
ical residual systematic error of an individual order, for
the spectra of 18 and 21.08.92, when the largest number
of stellar lines were observed, is 0.4 km/s. We consider this
value as the upper limit for the systematic error on the ra-
dial velocities listed in Table 2. The accuracy was success-
fully tested with the interstellar lines of NaI, which show
a constant velocity for the main component (23 km/s) and
for the depression in the red wing (about -12 km/s).

The second column of Table 2 contains the mean radial
velocities for the lines Fe I,II, Ti I,II, Cr I,II, which are pre-
dominant in the UU Her spectra, as well as for MgI, CaI,
SiII, ScII, BaII and some other ions. The random errors
reﬂect the inaccuracy of the measurements and reduction,
adopted laboratory wavelengths and some small diﬀeren-

ridge 1974) with small corrections for the gravitational
redshift, taking into account the lower gravity of UU Her.

4. Chemical composition

The CCD-spectra marked by ”a” in Table 1 were used for
the determination of the chemical composition of UU Her.
We interpolated between Kurucz‘s (1979) models, i.e. as-
sumed local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and hy-
drostatic equilibrium. It is known, however, that the atmo-
spheric parameters of a supergiant may be altered by non-
LTE eﬀects (by overionization mainly). But the inﬂuence
of these eﬀects on the relative values [X/Fe] is expected
to be low, since Hill et al. (1994) estimated abundances
with and without overionization and concluded that the
diﬀerences are below 0.06 dex.

The gf-values for most spectral lines were taken from
Thevenin (1989, 1990); for the lines of the neutral atoms
(Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe) we prefer the accurate experimental data
of the Oxford group (Blackwell et al. 1986); the CNO-
abundances were determined by using the gf-data from
the Waelkens et al. (1991).

It is obvious that the application of the standard
model atmosphere method to the analysis of spectra of
a star with an extended and unstable atmosphere can be
questioned. We therefore used only weak lines, which are
formed deeply, in our analysis. Most of the lines we used
have equivalent widths W less than 150 m˚A, but several
ionized iron and barium lines have W near 200 m˚A. To
control the validity of the method we analyzed in a similar
way the spectrum of the normal supergiant α Per, which is
a member of a young open cluster and has a solar chemi-
cal composition aside from the non-solar [CNO/Fe] which
may result from mixing of the products of hydrogen burn-
ing.

The main diﬃculty in the chemical composition calcu-
lation of UU Her is the determination of the eﬀective tem-
perature Teﬀ. First, the hydrogen line proﬁles in the spec-

tra of this unstable supergiant are distorted by dynamic
processes in the extended atmosphere (Fig. 1). Second, the
observed irregular variability of UU Her restricts the ap-
plication of photometric indices for the Teﬀ determination
too. Therefore we applied spectroscopic criteria for the de-
termination of the photospheric parameters, following an
iterative procedure. In several consecutive iterations we
determined Teﬀ - by forcing the independence of the neu-
tral iron abundance upon the line excitation potential, the
surface gravity log g – by forcing the ionization equilibrium
for FeI and FeII, and the microturbulent velocity ξt - by
forcing the independence of the abundance derived from
individual FeI lines upon the equivalent width. The errors
of the model parameters are typically ∆Teﬀ = ±200 K,
∆log g = ±0.5 and ∆ξt = ±0.5 km/s.

The adopted atmospheric parameters for diﬀerent ob-
serving dates are listed in Table 3. The calculated abun-
dances of chemical elements for three individual spectra of
UU Her are also given in Table 3, together with the solar
chemical composition (Grevesse, Noels 1993). The accu-
racy of the abundances depends on the accuracy of the
observational data and on that of the model ﬁtting; the
standard deviations are listed in Table 3 for all chemical
elements studied. For the elements with a number of lines
n > 5 the internal error σ does not exceed 0.2.

5. Discussion of the results

5.1. Radial velocities

The light curve of UU Her is similar to that of RV Tau vari-
ables (Zsoldos & Sasselov 1992). We therefore have to pay
attention to the line proﬁle anomalies typical for such pul-
sating population II stars. Unfortunately, the photometric
phases corresponding to the observing epochs of our spec-
trograms are not known. In fact, the eﬀects of pulsations
on the spectra appear to be small: obvious emission is
present only in the Hα - proﬁles, but the proﬁles of the
majority of absorption lines are quite normal. The posi-
tion of lines varies, but not the widths. The absorption
lines were not observed to become asymmetric or to split
into components.

No systematic progress of the velocity with depth of
the line formation zone or with ionization and excita-
tion potential was observed either. Therefore a unique
value of the radial velocity, obtained by averaging over
all measured absorption lines except Hα and Na I, is pre-
sented in column 2 of Table 2 for each observing date. It
should be noted that our radial velocity values fall within
the interval obtained, with a diﬀerent methodology, for
UU Her by Waelkens & Mayor (1993). Diﬀerential shifts
exceeding the methodic errors are seen for strongest lines
only: FeII 5018 ˚A, MgI 5183 ˚A, NaI 5890,96 ˚A, SiII 6347 ˚A,
Ba 6141 ˚A, 6497 ˚A. The asymmetry of the lines is small:
the cores of the lines show both blue and red displace-
ments not exceeding 1-2 km/s. The wings tend to be dis-

placed blueward by 2-3 km/s. For the extreme case of the
resonance lines of Na I this is clearly seen from the com-
parison of columns 2 and 5 of Table 2 and from Fig. 2. It
is doubtful that this blue shift of the wings is a direct ma-
nifestation of the velocity gradient in the atmosphere. It
may suggest the presence of a weak emission, that slightly
raises the red wing; on the other hand, in the Hα emission
(Fig. 1, 2) the blue component usually dominates.

The radial velocity obtained from the Hα absorption
(column 6 of Table 2) deviates more strongly from the av-
erage photospheric velocity. As can be seen from Fig. 2,
this absorption aﬀects slightly both the position and the
proﬁle of the line. The half-width is similar to that of the
photospheric lines, and the proﬁle has not a Stark but
a Doppler shape. Most likely, then, the Hα-absorption is
formed in an extended and relatively stable (at least from
August 1992 to June 1993) circumstellar envelope. Our
limited data set does not allow us to decide whether the
Hα-velocity (about -135 km/s in the echelle spectra) cor-
responds to the center-of-mass velocity of the star.

The temporal characteristics of the movements in the
atmosphere of UU Her can be discussed from the data
for all absorption lines except Hα. Certainly, our observa-

tional data are not suﬃciently numerous for an indepen-
dent estimate of a characteristic timescale. We note that
during three days (from August 18 to August 21 1992) the
velocity almost did not change, but that over ten months it
varied by some 15 km/s. From the photometry it is known
that pulsations occur with the 73-days fundamental mode
and the 45-days ﬁrst overtone (Zsoldos & Sasselov 1992);
the spectroscopy suggests that this oscillations are accom-
panied by velocity variations with some 15 km/s and with
a cycle duration no less than 1 month. The need for si-
multaneous observations of both kinds is obvious.

5.2. Chemical abundance pattern

The details of the chemical abundances of UU Her are con-
sidered with respect to the iron content ǫ(Fe):

[X/Fe] = [logǫ(X) − logǫ(X)]⋆ − [logǫ(X) − logǫ(X)]⊙.

The values [X/Fe] for UU Her are presented in Table 4. For
comparison we there also list results for the normal mas-
sive supergiant αPer (Klochkova 1995) and for the post-
AGB star ROA24 in the the globular cluster ω Cen (Gon-
zalez & Wallerstein 1992). Below we compare the chemical

composition of these three high-luminosity objects. In Ta-
ble 5 we present the W-value of lines obtained from one of
our spectra of UU Her. Given there are also the gf-values
and the results of the abundance calculations of the chem-
ical elements that are most important for our purpose.
Lithium. The lithium doublet near λ6707 ˚A is very weak
(on average W = 6 m˚A) in the UU Her spectra, but it
is conﬁdently measured in all three studied spectra.
The calculated Li abundance is consistent with an ad-
vanced evolution stage of a halo star.

CNO-group. The behaviour of this triad is a major test of
the evolutionary status. As is shown in Tables 3 and
5, the abundances of the CNO elements in the at-
mosphere of UU Her could be determined accurately
from several lines. An underabundance of carbon and
overabundance of nitrogen relatively to iron are ob-
tained. An underabundance of carbon is also found
for the standard supergiant α Per, in according to an
evolutionary stage where this star went through the

ﬁrst dredge-up. On the other hand, the post-AGB star
ROA24 is overabundant in both carbon and nitrogen.
The oxygen abundance is diﬀerent for the three ob-
jects. For α Per oxygen is underabundant with respect
to iron. For ROA24 oxygen is much strengthened rela-
tively to iron, due to He burning at the red giant stage
and following mixing and dredging-up. For UU Her
the OI abundance is based on the very weak lines
near λ6155 ˚A; it is somewhat strengthened relatively
to iron. We thus conclude that the UU Her evolution-
ary stage is not so advanced as for ROA24: it appears
that the third dredge-up has not occured yet. It should
be noted that the abundance of OI calculated by using
the lines of the IR-triplet near λ7773 ˚A is larger still
(see Table 5). It is known that the lines of this triplet
are formed in non-LTE conditions in the atmosphere of
high luminosity star (Faraggiana et al. 1988, Kiselman
1993). Therefore we did not use these lines for the cal-
culation of the average ǫ(O). It should be repeated that

not so high as could be expected for a supergiant with
log g ≈ 1.0 (see Fig. 1). The total equivalent width of
the OI triplet lines is ΣW(OI) = 0.527 ˚A, in agreement
with the results of Arellano Ferro & Mendoza (1993),
who discussed a sample of high-latitude A-G super-
giants and concluded that for UU Her the luminosity
from the OI 7773 ˚A intensity is not so high as from
uvby, β-photometry.

Light metals. The abundance of some light metals pro-
duced by the α-process are enhanced for the UU Her:
[Mg/Fe] = 0.45, [Si/Fe] = 0.53. At the same time Na
and Ca are signiﬁcantly underabundant. The odd-even
eﬀect is present: [Na/Mg] = −0.46. The sodium and
calcium behaviour of UU Her is diﬀerent from that for
ROA24. The sodium content is especially interesting,
because it is known that it is often strengthened for
supergiants with masses larger than 2 − 3M⊙, where
it is an indication for the dredge-up of matter to the
surface of star (Denissenkov 1988). The lack of a Na-
excess is thus an additional argument for the hypothe-
sis that UU Her is an evolved low-mass metal-deﬁcient
star.

Metallicity. The iron abundance is determined for UU Her
with a high precision from a sample of 60-120 FeI lines
and more than ten FeII lines. The average metallicity
is equal to [Fe/H]⊙ = −1.32. The ratio for manganese
is close to the solar one: [Mn/Fe] = −0.02. The abun-
dance of the iron group elements (Sc, Ti, V, Cr) are
slightly decreased relatively to the Fe content. An aver-
age [X/Fe] ≈ −0.38 is found for these elements. Since
the abundances of these iron-group elements are not
altered during nuclear processes we suppose that the
systematic decreasing of ScII, TiII, CrII is the manifes-
tation of the departure from the LTE conditions. The
behavior of these elements is similar for the standard
star α Per. Probably, as noted by Barker et al. (1971),
there is any additional source of ionization in the at-
mospheres of high-luminosity stars for these ions with
a low second ionization potential. It should be noted
that the higher ratio [Mn/Fe] close to the solar one may
be explained by the uncounted superﬁne structure of
the atomic levels.

Heavy metals. From the s-process elements we measured
accurately three BaII lines (see Table 5). The abun-
dance from these individual BaII lines are in a good

f abundance is determided using forbidden line λ6300 ˚A

agreement. We conclude that Ba is deﬁcient and not
in excess for UU Her. Also the s-process element Y ap-
pears to be underabundant, but due to the weakness
of its lines this result is less deﬁnitive than for Ba. For
the normal supergiant α Per there is no s-process pe-
culiarity, but for ROA24 a prominent excess of Ba and
Y is observed, as is expected for a low mass star that
has undergone third dredge-up.
The abundance of lanthanides (La, Ce, Nd, Pr) and
of Eu, elements that are mainly produced by the r-
process, are slightly enhanced or normal relatively
to iron. For these heavy metals the average value is
[X/Fe] = +0.22 ± 0.06.

Considering all evidence, the chemical composition of
UU Her is close to the average for the sample of UU Her
candidates discussed by Klochkova & Panchuk (1993).

6. Conclusions

Spectroscopically, UU Her is a supergiant, because of its
low surface gravity log g ≈ 1.0. Its radial velocities re-
veal the oscillations with an amplitude of approximately
15 km/s and a cycle duration of approximately one month.
The main results of the chemical composition research

presented in this paper are as follows:

– an overall deﬁciency of metals,
– a slight overabundance of N in combination with a C

depletion,

– an overabundance with respect to iron of the even-Z

elements (Mg, Si) synthetized by the α-process,

– an abundance (with respect to iron) close to the solar

one of the other α-process elements Na and Ca,

– a strong odd-even eﬀect,
– the absence of any traces on the third dredge-up.

Therefore, from the chemical abundance pattern, tak-
ing into account the high radial velocity, the absence
of a detached envelope and IR-excess, we conclude that
UU Her did not yet undergo a signiﬁcant mass loss episode
and convection development.
