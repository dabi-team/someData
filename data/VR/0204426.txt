ABSTRACT

We present V R observations of QSO 2237+0305 conducted by the GLITP
collaboration from 1999 October 1 to 2000 February 3. The observations were
made with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope at Roque de los Muchachos
Observatory, La Palma (Spain). The PSF ﬁtting method and an adapted version
of the ISIS subtraction method have been used to derive the V R light curves
of the four components (A–D) of the quasar. The mean errors range in the
intervals 0.01–0.04 mag (PSF ﬁtting) and 0.01–0.02 mag (ISIS subtraction), with
the faintest component (D) having the largest uncertainties. We address the
relatively good agreement between the A-D light curves derived using diﬀerent

Introduction

Sixteen years after its discovery by Huchra and collaborators (Huchra et al. 1985),
the quadruply imaged QSO 2237+0305 is a system that remains of great theoretical and
In this system, a high-redshift quasar at z = 1.695 is lensed by a
observational interest.
nearly face-on, barred spiral galaxy at z = 0.039 (Huchra et al. 1985; Yee 1988). The
geometrical conﬁguration of the four lensed components, forming a fairly symmetrical and
compact cross around the galaxy nucleus, implies that the light rays of the four QSO images
pass through the bulge of the galaxy. Therefore, high optical depths to microlensing at the
QSO image positions (∼ 0.5) are obtained from models (e.g., Schmidt, Webster, & Lewis
1998). Moreover, thanks to the unusually small distance between the observer and the
lensing galaxy, the microlensing events should have a relatively short timescale of the order
of months. On the other hand, the time delays between the diﬀerent images derived from
models are estimated to be of the order of hours (e.g., Schmidt, Webster, & Lewis 1998) so
that evidence in favor of microlensing variability may be found in a direct way.

In fact, the above-mentioned theoretical expectations have been conﬁrmed, and the
ﬁrst detection of microlensing variability was made for this system (Irwin et al. 1989). Other
1991; Østensen et al.
microlensing events have also been reported (e.g., Corrigan et al.
1996; Wo´zniak et al. 2000a,b), and several groups are currently monitoring this gravitational
lens system. The aim of this paper is to present observations from a new optical monitor-
ing campaign obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) within the Gravitational
Lenses International Time Project (GLITP) collaboration. This ended monitoring program
included observations in two ﬁlters (V and R) with excellent temporal sampling (daily ob-
servations). Very good seeing conditions and angular resolutions of the cameras contributed
to the obtaining of accurate photometry for the four lensed components (A–D) of the distant
quasar.

2. Observations

We observed QSO 2237+0305 from 1999 October 1 to 2000 February 3, i.e., during
approximately four months. All observations were made with the 2.56 m NOT at the Roque
de los Muchachos Observatory, Canary Islands (Spain), using two diﬀerent cameras. Most
of the images correspond to the StanCam, which uses a SITe 1024×1024 CCD detector with
a 0.176 arcsec/pixel scale. On some nights (at the beginning of the monitoring period) we
took images with the ALFOSC camera. The ALFOSC camera uses a Loral-Lesser 2048×2048
CCD detector with a 0.188 arcsec/pixel scale.

During good weather/technical conditions on a given night, two consecutive 300 s expo-
sures were taken (one in the V band and another one in the R band). The mean FWHM of
the seeing disk was below 1′′ for 58% of nights in the V ﬁlter (68% in the R ﬁlter), and the
mean observing frequency in each optical band was of three images per week. Preprocessing
of the data included the usual bias subtraction and ﬂat-ﬁelding using dome and sky ﬂats
(when these were available). On some of the nights, more than one observation per ﬁlter
could be obtained. These were subsequently combined.

3. PSF photometry

Due to the small angular separation between the lensed components (≈ 2′′) and their
proximity to the galaxy nucleus, the photometry of QSO 2237+0305 is remarkably complex.
Assuming a reasonable proﬁle for the galaxy nucleus, one way to determine the brightness
of the four quasar components is through PSF ﬁtting.

After testing exponential disks and/or de Vaucouleurs proﬁles and diﬀerent image sizes,
we concluded that the best option for modeling the galaxy is a de Vaucouleurs proﬁle within
a relatively small region around the galaxy center. Therefore, we used a model consisting
of four pointlike sources and a de Vaucouleurs proﬁle convolved with a PSF image, plus a
constant background. The model was ﬁtted to the images by adjusting its parameters to
minimize the sum of the square residuals, as described in McLeod et al. (1998) and Leh´ar et
al.
(2000). The model contains the following parameters: the position and intensity for all
ﬁve sources (quasar components A–D and galaxy), the eﬀective radius (Reﬀ), the ellipticity
(ǫ) and the position angle (P.A.) for the galaxy, and the background.

On many CCD frames, there are four ﬁeld stars (those named α and β in Figure 1 of
Corrigan et al. 1991, plus two others) whose clean 2D proﬁles (the sky background has been
subtracted) can be used as valid reference PSFs. However, due to several reasons (saturation,
low signal-to-noise, etc.) not all ﬁeld stars were acceptable as valid reference PSFs in all

– 4 –

frames. We only selected and modeled the images having at least two valid PSFs, i.e., 52
images (or nights) in the V ﬁlter and 50 images in the R ﬁlter. The seeing in all these images
is below 1.′′4, so we conclude that up to this seeing level our method works properly, as we
will see in the results.

In principle, our photometric model has 19 parameters to ﬁt. However, for each image,
we reduced the number of free parameters to seven: quasar images intensities, absolute posi-
tion of the A component and the background. The procedure for ﬁxing the other parameters
was the following:

1. We applied the code to all images with a seeing (FWHM) better than 0.′′7 (7 images in
the V ﬁlter and 14 images in the R ﬁlter) allowing all parameters to be free. The mean
values obtained for the relative positions of the quasar components and the galaxy are
in excellent agreement with the results obtained by the CASTLES collaboration (Falco
et al. 2002, in preparation) using Hubble Space Telescope (HST )—the diﬀerences in
right ascension and declination are ≤ 0.′′006; see Table 1).

2. We applied the code to the images with the best seeing (FWHM < 0.′′7), setting only
the relative positions to those obtained in the previous step. The mean values obtained
for the galaxy parameters (Reﬀ, ǫ, and P.A.) are summarized in Table 2.

3. We applied the code to all images (whatever their seeings), setting the relative positions
and the galaxy parameters to those derived in steps 1 and 2, and allowing the remaining
parameters to vary. The results that we obtained for the integrated galaxy intensity
relative to that of α star are distributed around a central value (6.66 in the V band
and 7.44 in the R band) with a small dispersion (0.29 in the V band and 0.26 in the
R band), providing further evidence for the goodness of our ﬁt.

4. Finally, we applied the code to all the images now also setting the galaxy intensity to
the relative galaxy intensity (obtained in step 3) times the α star intensity inferred
from the code.

Given a frame, we made several measurements of the typical instrumental ﬂux of each
component (one for each valid reference PSF). Thus, we could use as the typical instrumental
ﬂux the mean value of diﬀerent PSF estimates and as error the standard deviation of the
mean. In this way (the PSFphotI task) we obtained one independent estimate of the error for
each day and components A–D. When only two valid PSFs were available, the uncertainty in
the typical instrumental ﬂux of the α star (the calibration star; see below) is assumed to be
the average of the standard deviations obtained from the days with three or four valid PSFs.
However, this procedure is not totally consistent with the fact that the brightest reference

– 5 –

stars probably lead to better estimates of the ﬂux than the others (the statistical weights
being diﬃcult to estimate). Moreover, the error measurements were obtained from poor
statistics (typically three values for the QSO components), and so the reliability of some
uncertainties could not be very high. In addition, it may be that certain sources of error
have not been taken into account. For these reasons, we alternatively estimated the ﬂux of
the compact sources (A–D and the α star) using only the brightest reference star that was
available for PSF photometry (the PSFphotII task). In this case, to compute the error in the
physical ﬂux we used the mean of the absolute diﬀerences between adjacent days, which is
a very conservative estimate since it neglects the possible day-to-day variability of the QSO
components.

To do the photometric calibration we chose the α star that is always present in the
images (frames), taking its V magnitude from Wo´zniak et al. (2000a) and R magnitude from
the Guide Star Catalog II (http://www-gsss.stsci.edu/gsc/gsc2/GSC2home.htm).

In Figure 1 we show the light curves for QSO 2237+0305 in the two bands obtained
with the variant PSFphotII. The PSFphotII task gives average errors of 0.01–0.04 mag in
the V band and 0.02–0.03 mag in the R band for images A–D, respectively. Comparison of
the PSFphotI and PSFphotII light curves revealed that there were no signiﬁcant deviations
between both sets of photometry.9

ISIS photometry

In addition to the PSF photometry described in the previous section, we also performed
image-subtraction photometry of the four lensed components of QSO 2237+0305. This
technique has been pioneered by Wo´zniak et al. (2000a,b), using the ISIS method developed
by Alard (2000). Because of the brightness of the lens, observations of this particular
multiply imaged quasar are well adapted for optimal image subtraction designed to eﬃciently
remove the galaxy contribution without modeling its photometric proﬁle. To do so, we
implemented in Li`ege a locally adapted and completed version (Moreau et al. 2002, in
preparation) of the public ISIS software provided by Alard10.

First of all, we rebinned all available CCD frames for each of the V and R passbands
so that they matched a common sampling pixel grid. A ﬁrst-order 2D polynomial ﬁt to the

positions of the ﬁeld stars was used to correct for oﬀsets and ﬁeld rotation; all the CCD
frames were then resampled on the same pixel grid using bicubic spline interpolation.

At this step, stacking or subtracting images becomes possible for a strictly astrometric
application, but for an optimal co-addition, we must take into account the disparities in
seeing, sky background level, and possibly PSF shape from one image to another. For both
passbands, we built a reference frame by median-stacking eight selected images with best
seeing which were ﬁrst convolved with an optimal 2D kernel in order to match a common PSF
shape and refer to similar observing conditions. Following Alard, we modeled the convolution
kernels as linear combinations of three 2D Gaussian proﬁles, each Gaussian being apodized by
a 2D polynomial and then normalized in ﬂux. The best-ﬁt kernel coeﬃcients were determined
using a least-squares algorithm taking into account the diﬀerences of the local sky background
values. We then co-added these eight convolved images for both passbands and built up a
deep and quasi-noiseless V (and R) reference frame.

This reference frame was subsequently subtracted from each of the individual CCD
frames in order to obtain diﬀerential images where the only residuals expected to appear
lie at the positions of the variable objects. Of course, the subtraction operation was also
optimized in the sense that the reference frame was successively convolved with an adapted
kernel in order the better to match best each individual frame. The optimal kernel was
obtained as above by least-squares ﬁtting and an important point is that the coeﬃcients
of the kernel model were themselves considered non-constant and also described by 2D
polynomials, enabling space-varying kernel solutions. Thanks to this method, the deﬂecting
galaxy totally disappears after the optimal subtraction and the observed residuals essentially
correspond to the four variable lensed quasar images (details will be given in Moreau et al.
2002, in preparation).

We could then perform a simultaneous 4-PSF ﬁtting photometry of all diﬀerential frames
obtained by optimal subtraction in order to measure for each of the four lensed components
the respective ﬂux diﬀerences between each individual frame and the reference one. The
photometry process begins with the determination of a mean PSF model in the reference
frame. We use a routine provided in ISIS which builds a normalized composite PSF out of a
few bright star proﬁles distributed all over the ﬁeld. The PSF model obtained may now be
adapted to each subtracted image by ﬂux-normalized convolution with the respective optimal
kernels successively determined during the subtraction process. Using original dedicated
software, we then derived the ﬂux diﬀerences from all subtracted images by simultaneous
least-squares ﬁtting of four scaled PSF models (with either positive or negative amplitudes),
resampled from spline interpolation in order to perfectly coincide with the exact positions
of the four components forming the gravitational lens system QSO 2237+0305.

– 7 –

As we are performing diﬀerential photometry, there has so far been no need to assume
light-distribution models for the galaxy, with their attendant errors. But of course, in order
to get the absolute ﬂuxes at all observing epochs for each of the four lensed components of
QSO 2237+0305, we need to perform in both the V and R passbands direct photometry on
the reference frame and, for this zero-point adjustment, we must determine a model for the
photometric proﬁle of the lensing galaxy.

Absolute photometry of the four lensed components of QSO 2237+0305 was derived for
each passband using the so-called General program (Remy 1996; Østensen et al. 1996). We
ﬁtted to the relevant part of the reference frame a global model of the gravitational lens
made of one PSF for each of the four lensed components plus a model of the galaxy proﬁle.
Using a public-domain HST image, we measured very accurately the positions of three of the
lensed components and that of the galaxy center relatively to the fourth lensed component
(component A), the position of which is a free parameter in the ﬁt. For the lens galaxy model,
we adopted in the V band a combination of a central PSF plus four Gaussian functions with
diﬀerent widths, which led to faint and acceptable residuals. But in the case of the R band,
the galaxy model turned out to be more complex and we ﬁtted the galaxy using various
possible models (PSF + Gaussians, exponential disk, or de Vaucouleurs proﬁles). As we did
not ﬁnd any model clearly better than another, we averaged the photometric measurements
derived for the four lensed components only taking into account the best models (one PSF +
two, three, or four Gaussians and one PSF + de Vaucouleurs proﬁle), which led to the faintest
acceptable residuals. Having derived the ﬂux of the four lensed components in the reference
frame (with an estimated accuracy of 0.2–2.1% in V and 0.1–2.6% in R, for components A
to D), we then obtained their absolute ﬂuxes at all observing epochs and, using as in section
3 the α photometric calibration star, we ﬁnally constructed their photometric light curves
(see Figure 2).

The next step then consisted in deriving realistic estimates for the photometric error
bars. We simulated about one hundred observations for each epoch. Of course, each sim-
ulated frame contained the four lensed components of QSO 2237+0305, the lensing galaxy
and the stars in the ﬁeld in order to mimic very precisely the CCD frames obtained at the
telescope. These simulations were made taking into account the observed seeing and sky
background, as well as the CCD read-out noise and photon noise. Later on, we applied
the adapted ISIS image-subtraction method to our simulated images. We thus derived for
each observing date the average and the variance of the ﬂux for each of the four lensed
components and ﬁnally obtained from magnitude calibration estimated 1σ error bars. The
averaged values of these error bars are 0.007, 0.017, 0.013 and 0.024 mag in the V band and

– 8 –

0.005, 0.008, 0.007 and 0.013 in the R band, for components A, B, C and D, respectively.11
The ISIS light curves were constructed out of 53 measurements in the V band and 51 in
the R band. Among the available observations, we rejected in fact all frames with a seeing
larger than, or equal to, 1.′′8 (i.e. 2 frames in the V band and 4 in the R one), plus the V
observation on December 13rd, because of a detector line problem exactly located on the
image of QSO 2237+0305.

If we compare our absolute ﬂuxes with those derived from the results obtained by PSF
photometry (Section 3), we have a diﬀerence of 0.6% for A & B, 2.0% for C and 4.0% for
D in the V band, and 0.3% for A & B, 5.0% for C, and 9.5% for D in the R band. Let us
recall however, that, here errors due to the modeling of the galaxy proﬁle only aﬀect the
zero point of the ﬂuxes, not the general relative trend of the photometric light curves.

5. Discussion

In Figure 3 we compare the light curves in the V band of the four lensed images of
QSO 2237+0305 obtained from the GLITP data (both PSF and ISIS photometry) and the
OGLE data (Wo´zniak et al. 2000b). The behavior of the new light curves (A–D) in the
V band basically agree with the trends reported by the OGLE collaboration during the
same monitoring interval, and this strengthens both sets of photometry (OGLE and our new
dataset). There is a remarkable similarity among the three sets of light curves (GLITP/PSF,
GLITP/ISIS, and OGLE), which involve diﬀerent photometric methods and/or telescopes.
However, we notice that the GLITP data extend the time coverage by more than a month
during a decisive period in which a high-magniﬁcation microlensing event is observed for the
A component. In Figures 1 and 2, a general agreement between the V and R trends can be
also seen, although a full discussion on the observed V − R color gradients is beyond the
scope of this introductory paper.

The two diﬀerent data processing techniques (PSF and ISIS) generate error bars with
diﬀerent sizes. However this fact does not imply that one approach is better than the other
one, because the estimate of the errors also depends on the method. In fact if we calculate
the diﬀerences between consecutive nights we will ﬁnd that the ISIS photometry has smaller
dispersion than the PSF method for the A component but greater for the B, C, and D
components.

lens/bibdat/engl/lc−2237.html

– 9 –

If we examine Figure 3 in detail, we see some slight discrepancies for several days. The
trends of components A and B are remarkably similar and the other two components show
a less good agreement. In the three photometry sets there is a drop for the C component,
but at the end of the GLITP/ISIS light curve there is a rise. For the D component, the
GLITP/PSF light curve is ﬂatter than the others. These diﬀerences could play a role in the
interpretation of the trends. On the other hand, due to the very good time coverage in the
two optical bands (e.g., from the PSF photometry we obtained 52 ﬁnal data in the V band in
120 days) and the achievement of light curves characterized by reliable and relatively small
photometric errors, the new dataset constitutes an important tool for further studies.
In
particular, several microlensing analyses are now in progress and will appear in forthcoming
papers.
