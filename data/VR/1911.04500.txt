Abstract

Virtual Reality (VR) technology has been subject to a rapid democratization in recent years, driven in large by the
entertainment industry, and epitomized by the emergence of consumer-grade, plug-and-play, room-scale VR devices.
To explore the scientiﬁc potential of this technology for the ﬁeld of observational astrophysics, we have created an
experimental VR application: E0102-VR. The speciﬁc scientiﬁc goal of this application is to facilitate the characterization
of the 3D structure of the oxygen-rich ejecta in the young supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219 in the Small Magellanic
Cloud. Using E0102-VR, we measure the physical size of two large cavities in the system, including a (7.0±0.5) pc-long
funnel structure on the far-side of the remnant. The E0102-VR application, albeit experimental, demonstrates the
beneﬁts of using human depth perception for a rapid and accurate characterization of complex 3D structures. Given the
implementation costs (time-wise) of a dedicated VR application like E0102-VR, we conclude that the future of VR for
scientiﬁc purposes in astrophysics most likely resides in the development of a robust, generic application dedicated to
the exploration and visualization of 3D observational datasets, akin to a “ds9-VR”.

1. Introduction

The emergence of plug-and-play Virtual Reality (VR)
devices is opening new avenues for the visualization and
communication of scientiﬁc datasets. The perceived matu-
rity of VR technology is reﬂected in its location within the
(informative, albeit highly subjective) Hype Cycle pub-
lished yearly by Gartner1. Speciﬁcally, VR technology was
deemed to have moved out of the “trough of disillusion-
ment” into the “slope of enlightenment” in 2016, with a
predicted reach of the “plateau of productivity” within 5-
10 years. Undoubtedly, exploring the potential of VR for
astrophysics is a timely venture.

The development of consumer-grade VR devices, which
can provide robust, room-scale, immersive VR experiences
to the general public, has been largely driven by the enter-
tainment industry. In early 2019, the two gaming engines
unity3d and unrealengine both allow to assemble ex-

perimental VR applications for free2. This fact greatly
facilitates the creation of non-commercially-viable VR ex-
periences, such as applications for scientiﬁc outreach pur-
poses, for example.

The potential of VR for astrophysics has already been
identiﬁed, be it in the form of immersive and interactive
experiences (see e.g. Farr et al., 2009; Djorgovski et al.,
2013; Ferrand et al., 2016; Fluke & Barnes, 2018) or 360◦
videos (Russell, 2017; Davelaar et al., 2018). For outreach
purposes, VR technology can provide the general public
with a highly enticing means to apprehend complex astro-
physical datasets and concepts (Ferrand & Warren, 2018;
Arcand et al., 2018). The use of VR for the purpose
of scientiﬁc analysis in astrophysics is perhaps less evi-
dent, but it is certainly not an unchartered territory (Lee
et al., 2018; Romano et al., 2019, ; Law et al., in prepa-
ration; McGraw et al., in preparation). Dedicated experi-
ments include the “VRlab” developed at the Universit¨ats-
Sternwarte M¨unchen3, the VR tools developed at the Hu-
manities lab of Lund University4, and the “3DMAP-VR”

platform for the data visualization of 3D magneto-hydro-
dynamic models of supernova remnants and young stel-
lar objects developed at INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico
di Palermo. Here, we present E0102-VR (Baracaglia &
Vogt, 2019), an experimental VR application designed to
explore the scientiﬁc potential (and challenges) of VR tech-
nology for the visualization and characterization of multi-
dimensional datasets in observational astrophysics.

The oxygen-rich supernova remnant (SNR) 1E 0102.2-
7219 (E 0102 for short; Dopita et al., 1981; Tuohy &
Dopita, 1983) is located in the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC), at a distance of ∼62 kpc (Graczyk et al., 2014;
Scowcroft et al., 2016). At optical wavelengths, it displays
an intricate set of ﬁlaments visible primarily in the line
of [O III] λλ4959,5007˚A, but not only (Blair et al., 2000;
Seitenzahl et al., 2018). These ﬁlaments correspond to the
outer layers of the progenitor star, which are visible today
as they encounter the reverse shock (Sutherland & Do-
pita, 1995). From their proper motions measured with the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST ), Finkelstein et al. (2006)
derived an age of (2054±584) yr for the remnant.

For a SNR in the “free expansion” phase of its life (Do-
pita & Sutherland, 2003), interactions with the surround-
ing medium have not yet signiﬁcantly altered the chemi-
cal composition and/or kinematics of the ejecta knots. If
one assumes ballistic expansion for the ejecta in E0102,
the depth z of a given knot along the line-of-sight can be
trivially derived from its relative radial velocity (with re-
spect to that of the SMC). The actual 3D structure of the
oxygen-bright ejecta in E 0102 can thus be reconstructed
from a complete spectro-photometric map of the system
(Vogt & Dopita, 2010; Vogt et al., 2017b).

Deep observations of SNR E 0102 (Vogt et al., 2017a)
with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE; Bacon
et al., 2010) integral ﬁeld spectrograph at the Very Large
Telescope revealed a peculiar ring of Ne I and O I emis-
sion. This ring, (0.63 ± 0.11) pc in radius, led to the iden-
tiﬁcation (in archival Chandra X-ray Observatory data) of
the Central Compact Object (CCO) in the system (Vogt
et al., 2018; Hebbar et al., 2019). The exact nature of
the Ne and O optical ring surrounding the CCO remains
unclear. Vogt et al. (2018) argue that the excellent spa-
tial alignment between the pc-size optical ring and the
CCO, (2054±584) yr after the core-collapse, suggests that
the center of the ring corresponds to the supernova explo-
sion site. This location, however, is ∼10(cid:48)(cid:48) ≡ 3 pc away from
the center of symmetry of the very regular X-ray emission
of the system (Gaetz et al., 2000; Xi et al., 2019), which
would then require speciﬁc circumstances in the structure
of the surrounding medium to be explained. The overall
on-sky distribution of the oxygen-rich ejecta visible at opti-
cal wavelengths is also signiﬁcantly more asymmetric than
the X-ray emission. The characterization of the actual 3D
structure of the optical ejecta in E 0102 hence appears as
an important step towards assembling a coherent evolu-
tionary scenario that could reconcile observations across
all wavelength ranges. The VR application E0102-VR,

that we present in this article, was assembled to that end.
The spirit of the application is discussed in more details in
Sec. 2. With the aid of E0102-VR, we characterize the 3D
structure of the optical ejecta in SNR E 0102 in Sec. 3. We
conclude with a discussion of the potential of VR for the
scientiﬁc analysis of multi-dimensional datasets in observa-
tional astrophysics in Sec. 4. All uniform resource locators

2. The E0102-VR application

E0102-VR was developed at the Chilean headquarters
of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Santiago
between June and August 2018. It relied on a 4 m × 4 m
“VR arena” assembled for this purpose (see Fig. 1 and
Table 1 for details). Two position-tracking sensors (the
HTC Vive Base Stations) allow users to move freely over
the entire spatial extent of the VR arena, and in so doing,
to physically navigate through the virtual world.

Figure 1: Overview of the VR arena assembled in the library of the
Chilean headquarters of ESO in Santiago (Chile), with F.P.A.V in
immersion. In addition to the 4 m×4 m interaction area, the foot-
print of the arena includes a tripod supporting one of the two tracking
stations (A) and a dedicated computer (B). The VR arena is thus
highly ﬂexible and its space can be easily reclaimed for other purposes
if/when needed. Safety tape on the ﬂoor and foam padding con-
tribute to providing a secure environment for users and by-standers
alike.

E0102-VR is an experimental application. The primary
goals that drove its development are: a) to explore the ca-
pabilities (and limits) of VR to visualize and analyze 3D
datasets from observational astrophysics, and b) to iden-
tify the challenges and costs associated with assembling
such a dedicated VR application. Although this experi-
ment was driven by the speciﬁc case of SNR E 0102, the
application itself was developed in such a way that it does
not explicitly rely on a speciﬁc dataset. Pre-compilation,
the dataset at the core of the application can be swapped
with no major loss of functionalities. For simplicity and

robustness purposes, however, the complied E0102-VR ap-
plication does not provide users with a means to upload
diﬀerent datasets.

E0102-VR was built using the unity3d software, sup-
plemented with custom c# scripts. We purposely re-
stricted the scope of the application upfront, as follows.
First, the application was developed solely for the HTC
Vive: the VR device at our disposal. Whereas this de-
cision undoubtedly restricts the pool of potential users,
it allowed us to focus our entire attention on exploring
the scientiﬁc potential of VR, rather than tackle possible
device compatibility challenges which are prone to rapid
evolution. Second, the 3D structure of the optical ejecta in
SNR E 0102 is visualized using a set of pre-computed iso-
surfaces fed “as-is” to the application. Volumetric render-
ing, an alternative visualization technique to iso-surfaces,
is less straightforward to implement, and its potential is
already being explored by others (see e.g. Ferrand et al.,
2016; Ferrand & Warren, 2018). We also favor iso-surfaces,
as they can easily be used, by means of the X3D pathway
(Vogt et al., 2016), to generate an interactive 3D model of
the ejecta structure publishable in the scientiﬁc literature
(see Fig. 2).

The compiled application (which requires an HTC Vive
to be run) is freely available online5. All the source code
written by us (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3523259) is released
on a dedicated Github repository6 under the GNU General
Public License version 3. At the time of publication, the
terms of service associated with the use of free assets from
the unity3d store (see below) prevent us from releasing

The North direction (marked by the green arrow) is coming out in
front of the slicing plane by 24◦. The funnel structure is clearly
visible in this plane, with the CCO at its base. The black circle
is 3 pc≡10(cid:48)(cid:48) in radius. The center of symmetry of the X-ray emis-
sion from SNR E 0102 (set along the depth axis at the same level
as that of the CCO) is marked with a yellow cube. The center of

ange sphere. The scale of the model is the same in both panels.

ages from the unity3d asset store.

The iso-surfaces associated with the [O III] emission
in SNR E 0102 were computed in python using the
mayavi package (Ramachandran & Varoquaux, 2011).
We restricted ourselves to a set of 4 iso-surfaces, as-
sociated with [O III] emission levels of [25, 12, 6, 2.5] ×

3

10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 ˚A−1. We followed the steps de-
scribed by Vogt et al. (2017b) to de-blend the two
[O III] λλ4969,5007˚A lines, and transform the original
“R.A.-Dec.-λ” MUSE datacube to an “x − y − z” 3D map
in units of pc × pc × pc. The iso-contours generated using
mayavi are saved to a single obj ﬁle, together with an
mtl (material) ﬁle specifying the color and transparency
of each surface. The choice of this ﬁle format was dictated
mainly by its compatibility with unity3d, and by the fact
that obj ﬁles can be easily edited and handled by a wide
variety of software. In addition to the 4 iso-surfaces, the
ﬁnal 3D structure fed to the E0102-VR application also
includes 1) a purple sphere to mark the location of the
CCO in the system, which we set as the reference of the
coordinate system, and 2) a wireframe sphere of 3 pc in
radius to provide users with an indication of scale.

Within the application, the user primarily interacts with
the data by means of a series of distinct and complemen-
tary interaction modes, which can be enabled or disabled
from a dedicated “mode menu” (see Fig. 3). The diﬀerent
interaction modes, some of which can be used in parallel,
are: 1) translation, 2) rotation, 3) x-y-z clip planes, 4) full-
freedom clip plane, 5) measurement, and 6) transparency.
The need to separate the diﬀerent interaction modes is
primarily driven by the limited number of buttons present
on the HTC Vive controllers. In that sense, E0102-VR is
somewhat reminiscent of the ds9 software (Joye & Man-
del, 2003) and the variety of functions that it can assign
to the mouse buttons.

The two clip plane modes, which let the user slice 3D
structures to obtain cut views (in the case of E0102-VR,
either along the X-Y-Z axes, or freely) rely on the Cross-
SectionShader package7. These modes were imple-
mented in an eﬀort to mimic the similar capabilities pro-
vided by the X3D pathway (Vogt et al., 2017b). The mea-
surement mode, on the other hand, is a uniquely-VR fea-
ture, in that it relies on the depth perception provided by
the system to the user. Speciﬁcally, this interaction mode
allows the user to place measurement points throughout
the 3D environment. Each point displays its cartesian and
spherical coordinates. Diﬀerent measurement points can
also be selected to measure the distance (in the native
model units; pc in the case of SNR E 0102) between them
(see Fig. 3).

The content of the model, comprised in our case of 6
individual parts, is visible via a dedicated “parts menu”.
This menu takes the form of small panel attached to one of
the controller, akin to a painter palette. From this menu,
the user can show or hide individual parts of the model,
or reset them to their default position (as each part can
be grabbed and moved freely).

We have made some eﬀorts to ensure that our choice
of buttons associated with the diﬀerent interaction modes
is reasonably comfortable and intuitive. We opted against

the inclusion of a written instruction manual inside E0102-
VR. Whereas such a manual is present on the app website8,
we favored visual cues inside the app to aid the users in
understanding the diﬀerent interaction modes. The con-
troller buttons carry explicit symbols and/or simple words
(some of which change depending on the chosen interac-
tion mode) illustrating the associated function. Descrip-
tive panels are also visible (immediately below the mode
menu) when a speciﬁc interaction mode is enabled (see
Figs. 3 and 4). Undeniably, however, E0102-VR remains
an experimental application with room for improvement
on the user-interaction front. In particular, the β-testing
of the E0102-VR application by members of the ESO staﬀ,
Fellow, and student communities revealed that the more
advanced interaction modes that rely on the active interac-
tion of the users with the model (such as the measurement
mode, for example) are not immediately understood by all
users. We note, however, that all users appeared to feel
rapidly comfortable with even the most complex of the
interaction modes once understood.

3. The optical ejecta in E 0102

The 3D structure of the oxygen-bright ejecta in SNR
E 0102 was reconstructed by Vogt & Dopita (2010),
based on observations from the Wide-Field Spectrograph
(WiFeS; Dopita et al., 2007, 2010). The structure was
published as an interactive PDF ﬁle, with the signiﬁcant
drawback that it forced readers to use speciﬁc software to
access it. Vogt et al. (2017b) revisited the problem using
a new set of WiFeS observations and the X3D pathway
(Vogt et al., 2016).

The 3D map of the oxygen-bright ejecta in SNR E 0102
discussed here and included in the E0102-VR application
is based on MUSE observations acquired under programme
297.D-5058[A] (P.I. Vogt) and described in detail by Vogt
et al. (2017a). Spatially, this map has a seeing-limited
resolution of 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48) ≡0.2 pc, which is ∼2 times sharper than
the previous WiFeS observations. Along the line-of-sight,
however, the spectral resolution of MUSE (and thus the
spatial resolution of the derived map) at the wavelength
of [O III] 5007˚A is ∼2.3 times worse than achieved with
WiFeS in its high resolution mode. Whereas the MUSE
3D map can be best visualized and characterized using
the E0102-VR application, we also make it accessible as
an online interactive ﬁgure (available at http://fpavogt.
github.io/E0102-VR). With it, any reader ought to be
able identify the diﬀerent structures present within the
ejecta (and discussed below) without the need for an HTC
Vive.

The spatial distribution of the oxygen-bright knots of
ejecta in SNR E 0102 is complex, but not disorganized.
Large, irregular walls and sheets of emission, up to a few
pc in length, separate equally large voids (in the optical

line of [O III]). The walls, spatially unresolved in the MUSE
datacube, have a thickness < 0.5 pc. From the HST ob-
servations of the system (Finkelstein et al., 2006), their
thickness is likely (cid:46) 0.05 pc. This is reminiscent of the
equally-structured ejecta in Cassiopeia A (Isensee et al.,
2010; DeLaney et al., 2010; Milisavljevic & Fesen, 2013),
which may be tracing the boundaries of plumes of 56Ni-rich
ejecta (Blondin et al., 2001; Milisavljevic & Fesen, 2015;
Wongwathanarat et al., 2017).

On the far-side of the remnant (i.e. the side facing away
from Earth), a large funnel-like structure is particularly
noticeable. The structure is (7.0 ± 0.5) pc long with a
cross-section of (4.0 ± 0.5) × (3.0 ± 0.5) pc×pc at half-
maximum, and does not contain any [O III] emission at
a level ≥ 2.5 × 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 ˚A−1 (see Fig. 2). Along

the z ≡ radial velocity direction, the base of the funnel is
coincident with the rest-frame of the SMC to within the
spectral resolution of MUSE at a 1σ level. Spatially, the
base of the funnel has a size of (3.0±0.5)×(1.5±0.5) pc×pc
with the long axis rotated by (40±10)◦ East-of-North, and
seem to coincide with the location of the Ne-O ring sur-
rounding the CCO. On the near-side of the remnant, an
inverted cone-like opening, (5.0 ± 0.5) pc in diameter and
(3 ± 0.5) pc in length, could be described as an (asymmet-
ric, shallower) counterpart funnel.

One may be tempted to interpret the apparent align-
ment between the base of the funnel structure and the
Ne-O ring as another suggestion that this location was the
actual site of the SN explosion in SNR E0102. We do not
venture into this discussion here, which will very strongly

4. VR lessons learned from E0102-VR

The depth perception provided to the user by the E0102-
VR application greatly helps in understanding the complex
3D structure of the oxygen-bright ejecta in SNR E 0102.
Yet, this fact alone does not suﬃce to justify the eﬀorts
required to assemble the application in the ﬁrst place: for
example, the interactive 3D model of the ejecta assembled
using the X3D pathway can also provide the user with an
excellent understanding of the 3D structure with signiﬁ-
cantly less eﬀorts, and no speciﬁc gear required. What
makes the E0102-VR application stand-out from a scien-
tiﬁc perspective, however, is that it provides a rapid, easy,
and precise means to measure distances and angles in 3D.
Characterizing the size of structures in SNR E 0102 only
requires a few seconds in VR, as measurement points can
be accurately positioned in 3D space without any ambi-
guity: a feat which is nigh-impossible in 2D ﬁgures, be
they interactive or not. From that perspective, we foresee
that the ability to interact with the 3D model, and thus
the use of hand controllers, will be an essential component

of any VR application aimed at the scientiﬁc analysis of
astrophysical datasets.

The beneﬁts of a room-scale component, allowing the
user to physically “move around” in virtual space, are less
evident at this stage. During the β-testing of the E0102-
VR application, we noticed that users tend to rotate and
translate the model, rather than walk around it. This be-
havior may be a consequence of the disruptive presence
of cables connecting the HTC Vive headset to the desktop
computer, which tend to hinder user-motion. The removal
of these cables (in favor of a wireless connection) that took
place in June 2019 may possibly lead to an increased num-
ber of “wandering users” in the VR arena.

Evidently, the mere fact of measuring 3D distances and
angles within seconds is still very unlikely to justify (in
most cases) a time investment of 1 full-time-employee over
3-months to assemble a dedicated E0102-VR-like applica-
tion. Furthermore, as of 2019, VR technology relies on
a series of programming languages and software entirely
foreign to the vast majority of observational astronomers.
We are thus convinced that the future of VR in our ﬁeld
does not reside with dedicated, one-oﬀ applications like
E0102-VR. Rather, we see the wide-spread use of VR in
observational astrophysics (for scientiﬁc analysis purposes)
tied to the development of a high-level, generic application
dedicated to basic 3D data inspection and characteriza-

6

tion tasks: a type of application epitomized by ds9 for
2D datasets. The development of speciﬁc, one-oﬀ VR ap-
plications certainly already lies well within the reach of
motivated teams and individuals, but it is highly unlikely
for VR to become a wide-spread scientiﬁc tool in astro-
physics without the existence of a robust, polyvalent, and
generic application ﬁrst.

By design, none of the functionalities of the E0102-
VR application are intrinsically tied to the underlying 3D
model, to the extent that the model could be swapped (in
unity3d) with another without any major loss of function-
ality. Other experiments, including the VRlab9, have also
started to explore the enticing prospect of generic loading
modules for astrophysical datasets. This suggests that a
“ds9-VR” –an application dedicated to providing observa-
tional astronomers generic visualization, exploration and
measurement tools for 3D datasets– is both feasible and
technically viable, given existing VR hardware and soft-
ware. With the E0102-VR application and its measure-
ment mode, we have demonstrated some of the unique sci-
entiﬁc potential that such a tool could oﬀer. Other useful
VR interaction modes include, for example, the measure-
ment of volumes, the ability to draw and annotate mod-
els in 3D, and multi-user interactions. Diﬀerent means of
visualizing data, be it with the live reconstruction of iso-
contours or full volumetric rendering, also appears highly
desirable.

The ongoing democratization of room-scale, plug-and-
play VR devices will likely only prompt a limited number
of curious individuals and institutions to explore the po-
tential of VR technology for observational astronomy in
the months and years ahead. It is only if these pioneering
eﬀorts can be merged into a robust, high-level tool that
we would foresee the rest of the community to follow suit,
and start exploiting the potential of this technology for
scientiﬁc purposes.
