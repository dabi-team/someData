Mass Flow Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 for quantified COVID-19 Risk Analysis 
Gjalt Huppes and Ruben Huele, 14 October 2020, revised 29 October 2020 

Abstract 
How  may  exposure  risks  to  SARS-CoV-2  be  assessed  quantitatively?  The  material  metabolism 
approach of Industrial Ecology can be applied to the mass flows of these virions by their numbers, as 
a  key  step  in  the  analysis  of  the  current  pandemic.  Several  transmission  routes  of  SARS-2  from 
emission by a person to exposure of another person have been modelled and quantified. Start is a 
COVID-19  illness  progression  model  specifying  rising  emissions  by  an  infected  person:  the  human 
virion factory. The first route covers closed spaces, with an emission, concentration, and decay model 
quantifying exposure. A next set of routes covers person-to-person contacts mostly in open spaces, 
modelling the spatial distribution of exhales towards inhalation. These models also cover incidental 
exposures, like coughs and sneezes, and exposure through objects. Routes through animal contacts, 
excrements, and food, have not been quantified.  
Potential exposures differ by six orders of magnitude. Closed rooms, even with reasonable (VR 2) to 
good (VR 5) ventilation, constitute the major exposure risks. Close person-to-person contacts of longer 
duration create two orders of magnitude lower exposure risks. Open spaces may create risks an order 
of magnitude lower again. Burst of larger droplets may cause a common cold but not viral pneumonia 
as  the  virions  in  such  droplets  cannot  reach  the  alveoli.  Fomites  have  not  shown  viable  viruses  in 
hospitals, let alone infections. Infection by animals might be possible, as by cats and ferrets kept as 
pets.  These  results  indicate  priority  domains  for  individual  and  collective  measures.  All  Supporting 
Information can be downloaded from www.ScienceforStrategies.com/SARS-Covid . 
The wide divergence in outcomes indicates robustness to most modelling and data improvements, 
hardly  leading  to  major  changes  in  relative  exposure  potentials.  However,  models  and  data  can 
substantially be improved.

Industrial Ecology for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 

INTRODUCTION: Mass Flows of SARS-CoronaVirus-2 

1 
1.1 
In environmental sciences the analysis of toxic substances has a base structure of primary production 
in  the  environment  with  transport,  transformation, 
and  elimination  at  source;  processes 
concentration, and breakdown; and finally, exposure by humans, and by other creatures. The prime 
tool for this analysis is material flow analysis, for large volumes by mass and for smaller entities by 
their numbers. The new SARS-CoV-2 viruses (SARS-2 for short) are discrete entities, the size of Ultra 
Fine Particles (UFPs) at around 0.1Âµm hence are measured by their numbers. In the human factory 
they are produced, re-used, and controlled. The part remaining is emitted in different forms: as virion 
UFPs; as virion clusters of PM 2.5 size, the droplet nuclei remaining after mini-droplet evaporation; 
contained  in  larger  watery  and  mucal  droplets;  and  as  solid  waste,  as  stool  excrement.  These 
constitute the human factory emissions of an infected person, see flows 1 to 4 in Figure 1. Several 
factories may constitute a heavily contaminated industrial site.  
After emission there are different routes through the environment for the SARS-2 virions, ultimately 
still viable virions entering a person that potentially becomes a new COVID-19 patient: a new factory. 
As with toxic substances, these different routes towards possible exposure lead to different forms, 
concentrations, and volumes of contagion, with different options for immission reduction. The risks

Version 29 October 2020 

resulting are even more divergent. SARS-2 virions, like fine asbestos particles, are quite harmless on 
the skin but very harmful if arriving in the alveoli or intestines. Quantifications are prerequisite for 
assessing risks, as  basis for the design of prevention measures. The overall SARS-2 production should 
be  non-circular  and  decreasing.  This  quantified  Industrial  Ecology  approach  is  virtually  lacking  in 
current SARS-2 to COVID-19 discussions. 

There  is ample literature on  the medical, virologic, and  epidemiological aspects  of  SARS-2  and the 
Covid-19 illness it causes. Disparate approaches, with overlapping concepts, make the discussion and 
analysis difficult. Airborne emissions range from breathing, speaking, singing, sneezing and coughing, 
with immissions by inhalation of droplets of different sizes, airborne droplet nuclei and single virions, 
and acquiring viruses from physical contacts with larger droplets and contaminated objects brought 
to mouth and nose, including a route starting from excrements. For all these single elements in the 
Covid trajectories abundant literature is available. However, the full trajectories are lacking, let alone 
their combined and comparative analysis. That gap is filled by this paper. Of course, this is done in a 
preliminary way, as a framework to be improved upon as new information and better models become 
available. 

SARS-2 Virion Flow Scheme 

1.2 
A person ill with COVID-19 pneumonia has virion production primarily in his alveoli, over 50m2, with 
internal  secondary  infections  mostly  in  the  small  intestines,  together  resulting  in  four  types  of 
emission, nrs 1 to 4, see the overall framework in Figure 1. There are direct airborne emissions (1) and 
emissions of very small virions containing droplets (2). As these mini-droplets evaporate directly at 
exhalation, except in extremely humid circumstances, both are airborne emissions. Their shares are 
broadly disputed. Virions in larger droplets are the third type of emission. Data on virion density in 
them  is  mostly  lacking  with  first  approaches  in  the  older  review  by  (Gralton,  Tovey,  McLaws,  & 
Rawlinson, 2011) and for SARS-2 in (Vuorinen et al., 2020). The second main human production site is 
in the small intestines, covering around 35m2. Viable virions are found in excrements (4), emitted in 
diverse ways. Production and emission are modelled in Section 2 and quantified in Section 3 see the 
supporting information in www.ScienceforStrategies.com/SARS-Covid . 
The routes through the environment are modelled in Section 3, with results in Section 4. SARS-2 virions 
require ACE2 receptor cells for replication so only humans are sources, with possibly a minor role for 
animals like ferrets and cats. Also, SARS-virions break down quite fast. So, the routes towards exposure 
are relatively simple, only close to the sources. Main quantified attention is given first to closed spaces 
where  concentrations  can  build  up.  Next,  the  direct  person-to-person  routes  are  quantified:  the 
exhalations in breathing, speaking, and singing and the bursts of coughs and sneezes, inhaled by a 
person. A more semi-quantitative approach is developed for direct inhalation of larger droplets, on 
very short distance, and on intake to nose and mouth by contact exposure as with fomites.  
In Section 5 the quantified results of all routes to exposure are brought together, ordered as to the 
amount of potential virions intake. Results are discussed in Section 6. Technical measures and policy 
measures  for  prevention,  a  complex  subject,  are  not  treated.  Priority  domains  come  up  clearly 
however, with some conclusions in Section 7. 

From primary production to emission 

2  METHODS 1: Emission Model 
2.1 
The ill person is a human factory of the SARS-2 viruses, with SARS-2 production sites and emission 
sites,  and  with  removal  mechanisms  reducing  emissions,  the  factory  analogue.  There  are  two 
independent approaches for the quantification of emissions. One is based on modelling of the primary 
production and all the steps towards emission, building on empirical knowledge of the parts and on 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
Under review  

Version 29 October 2020 

mass balance principles. The second approach measures emissions directly, as flows from the factory 
chimneys, the nose and mouth, and in solid wastes as stool excrements. Both methods are followed 
here, with model data aligned to empirical data recently becoming available.  
Production facilities are concentrated in a few places in the body, only there where cells have an ACE2 
receptor. SARS-2 (and SARS-1) can only replicate in such cells, see (Hamming et al., 2004), for a full 
survey and with different emphasis (Bourgonje et al., 2020). Prime production is in the lungâs alveoli. 
Their combined surface is over 50m2 and much more at inhalation (FrÃ¶hlich, Mercuri, Wu, & Salar-
Behzadi, 2016). At Day 21 in the model, see Table 1, 2% of the 480 million alveoli (Ochs et al., 2004) 
are infected, over 1m2 of infected cells, rising to 20m2 at day 25. Such an infection on normal skin 
would make a person seriously ill. In the lungs, with only two cells thick surface to blood, it is serious 
SARS-2 pneumonia. The second main production location is in the small intestines, with a surface of 
at least 35m2. Much smaller amounts of these cells are in the airways, especially secretory and ciliated 
cells in the nose (but not so in the bronchi); in sweat glands in toes and hands; and in many small veins 
and arteries.

The surfactant-wetted virions produced leave the alveoli through the alveolar tubes and next enter 
the airways at the smallest bronchioli. At normal breathing many of these tubes collapse at end of 
exhalation, their mucal and watery walls taking in particles. With inhalation they enter the alveoli as 
minidroplets  leaving  the  filled  alveoli  at  next  exhalation.  They  mostly  are  below  1Âµm,  see  (Bake, 
Larsson, Ljungkvist, LjungstrÃ¶m, & Olin, 2019). At deep inhalation and exhalation, the tubes donât close 
and ultra-small particles such as virions can move directly to the airways, and out of them, emitting. 
That mini droplet forming process is described in detail in (Malashenko, Tsuda, & Haber, 2009).  
Contrary to SARS-1, around 80% of the SARS-2 virions produced are not viable (Ogando et al., 2020) 
Table 6b. Normal defense mechanisms, from trapping to destructing, take out a major part of outgoing 
viable SARS-2 virions, and very similar of incoming virions, see (Fokkens & Scheeren, 2000) on involved 
mechanisms.  Non-specific  defense  mechanisms  may  already  have  some  relation  with  SARS-2,  as 
possibly based on previous non-SARS corona common cold infections (Mateus et al., 2020). Specific 
defense  mechanisms  develop  later  after  infection  only,  then  halting  the  otherwise  exponential 
growth. Part of the mini-droplets caught in the mucus of the epithelial cells remains viable. It is mainly 
swallowed and may infect the also sensitive small intestines. Part may be coughed or sneezed out as 
large droplets, falling, and one part may exit as the second type of mini-droplets, airborne first but 
then as droplet nuclei at usual direct evaporation after exhalation. The share of mini-droplets from 
mucus is not known but must be a small share of virions in mucus, as most mucus is swallowed, and 
large  droplets dominate sneezes  and, less so, coughs,  see (Scharfman, Techet, Bush, &  Bourouiba, 
2016) Fig. 5 & 6.  
The  descriptions  here  refer  to  a  basically  healthy  person  infected.  However,  impaired  health  may 
change the shares. People breathing very superficially, because of lung illnesses or obesity, will not 
have  fresh air deep into their lungs to be exhaled; a larger share of viable virions than 15% might 
remain  inside  for  reinfection.  Also  impaired  lung  functioning  reduces  the  effectiveness  of  clearing 
particles from the airways, especially ultrafine particles (Brown, Zeman, & Bennett, 2002) to which 
individual virions belong. The overall destruction rate, set at 96%, will then be lower, the advance of 
illness faster and then emissions rising faster. 

Figure 2. Primary production and respiratory emissions of a SARS-2 infected person 

Exponentially expanding production modelled 

2.2 
Production of SARS-2 starts after effective infection. Next, the newly produced virions, the part not 
destroyed by defenses or emitted, enter other alveoli of that person. This leads to exponential growth 
unless specific defenses against SARS-2 come into play, halting the exponential growth. There is some 
discussion on how many virions should be taken in for effective infection, with airborne virions passing 
the alveolar tube to an alveolus. The theoretical minimum is 1 while a minimum of 100 is mentioned 
in (Mittal, Ni, & Seo, 2020). The model here assumes a starting number of 24 alveoli infected by at 

5 

 
 
 
Under review  

Version 29 October 2020 

least one virion. As most virions entering the respiratory tract are wiped out, 96% is assumed, the 
starting viral intake is set at 600, see Table 1. The Reference Person for emission is at Day 17, exhaling 
74321 virions per hour. Starting with only 1 infected alveolus would add 5 days to the route to illness, 
starting already with 1000 cells infected would reduce the time to illness with 6 days.  
In the first week or so the infected person will be asymptomatic, then develops symptoms, and at day 
21  hospital  admission  becomes  due,  moving  to  the  IC  Unit  a  few  days  later  if  own  defenses  and 
medicines  donât  bend  the  curve  downward.  This  roughly  covers  the  period  from  infection  to  PCR 
measurable infection, to symptoms and to serious illness if occurring, see the survey by (Gaythorpe et 
al., 2020), Figure 3 for a general impression, and the estimated days in (Petersen et al., 2020). The 
corresponding growth rate per day of 1.8 (doubling time 28 hours, compound growth 2.5% per hour) 
seems  a  reasonable  first  estimate.  It  will  be  slower  for  young  and  healthy  persons  and  faster  for 
persons with compromised basic defenses. The model indicates that heavy exposure leads to faster 
and more serious illness. 
Real life measurements of numbers of viable viruses exhaled require complex apparatus developed 
only a few year ago, see (Pan et al., 2016). PCRs cannot measure the viability of the collect nor really 
the concentration. In a modern high quality hospital room with two Covid-19 patients and one of them 
with a positive nose swab, (Lednicky et al., 2020) found a concentration of viable SARS-2 virions in air 
of 6 to 74 TCID50/L) corresponding to around 4000 to 52 000 virions As the ventilation speed and air 
mixing is not known this number cannot be linked to the number of exhaled virions but is compatible 
with  outcomes  of  (Ma  et  al.,  2020).  In  a  sample  of  just  ill  to  just-hospitalized  patients,  Ma  et  al. 
measured between 6000 and 600 000 viable virions per hour, with wide variations between persons 
and for the same person at different times. Taking the logarithmic mean of their results, the 60 000 
corresponds roughly to our modelled Day 17 number, while the 6000 links to Day 13 and 600 000 to 
Day 21. This is second corroboration of the speed of a personâs infection development in the model. 
This virion production location of SARS-2 is very different from that of influenza. There replication is 
in the respiratory tract, not in the alveoli. Viral cold, sore throat and bronchitis are prime flu illnesses, 
much more severe there than in COVID-19. However, influenza breaks down the respiratory epithelial 
defense mechanisms against intruders. Bacterial infection to the alveoli may result, with possibly a 
deadly bacterial pneumonia following, indirectly. With SARS-2, it is very different: The  bronchi are 
hardly affected, but a viral pneumonia is induced directly, in the ACE2 receptor cells of the alveoli, see 
(Hamming et al., 2004). 

3  RESULTS 1: Emissions 
3.1  Distribution of SARS-2 virions over respiratory outflows 
The total share of production coming out in mucus - swallowed or sneezed and coughed out - is set 
somewhat arbitrarily. Let us assume a distribution of the virions going upwards in the airways as 40% 
caught  stably  in  mucus  and  60%  as  mini  droplets  with  virions  and  free-floating  virions.  The  mini-
droplets  and  virions  are  exhaled,  together  covering  20%  of  the  primary  virions  production  in  the 
alveoli.  The  number  of  free-floating  viruses  emitted  nearly  doubles  every  day,  proportional  with 
primary production. At a certain stage, the virus-specific defenses must come up or the patients will 
die. With exponential growth, 96% internal destruction and only 15% of viable primary production to 
new infection, the virus will have destructed all his alveoli around day 29, and the patient is dead. That 
factory closes forever. However, specific defenses against viruses tend to come up from day 7 to day 
14  after  the  onset  of  infection,  different  in  different  persons,  halting  the  exponential  growth  and 
creating degrowth for recovery. Taking day 17 as a reference emission, the airborne emissions is of 
the Standard Person is 74 321 virions per hour. This is the first emission flow, next spreading in the 
environment.

Version 29 October 2020 

3.2  Mucal flows to droplets and to intestines 
The 40% virions caught in mucus is mostly swallowed, in the order of 50 000 virions per hour. If passing 
the stomach, they can multiply in the ACE2 receptor cells abundantly present in the small intestines. 
SARS-2  virions  are  widely  present  in  stool  excrements,  also  after  the  alveolar  production  and 
measurement in nose and throat swabs has become zero, till up to 6 weeks later (He, Wang, Li, & Shi, 
2020). 
Mucus  not  swallowed  is  exhaled  by  coughing  and  sneezing.  Vibrations  and  the  sheer  speed  of  air 
movement in coughing and sneezing, up to 14m/s (Scharfman et al., 2016) and up to 30m/s (100km/h) 
(Bourouiba, 2020), makes some mucus airborne, leaving by nose and mouth. Singing, speaking, and 
breathing do not produce virions but may also bring out virion containing droplets, from mucus or 
airborne from the alveoli directly. They are very small, 10 to 1Âµm, and evaporate to droplet nuclei at 
very short distance in all normal circumstances, within 40cm. The mucus exhalation will partly be in 
the domain of these mini droplets adding to the airborne viruses not contained in mucus, see flow 
x?% in Figure 2. These are reckoned here as part of airborne emissions as only larger droplets fall by 
gravity.  Even  if  this mini-mucus-droplets  amount  would  be  a  substantial  part,  say one  third of  the 
mucus-caught viruses coughed out, this would not increase the airborne flow substantially.  
The mucus flow exhaled in bursts as larger droplets is not airborne but falls mostly within half a meter, 
larger  distances  (Bourouiba,  2020;  Bourouiba, 
with  some  parts  of  the  bursts  reaching 
Dehandschoewercker, & Bush, 2014; Duguid, 1946; Scharfman et al., 2016). The burst is a part of the 
total exhalations of a person, a onetime event, or a series of such events. It is assumed here that all 
virions produced in one minute and as entered in not-swallowed mucus is coughed or sneezed out, in 
one burst per minute. The outward route by the nose does not add virions as they are produced in the 
alveoli.  The  concentration  of  the  wetter  sneeze  droplets  will  be  substantially  lower,  compare  the 
figures 3 and 4 in (Scharfman et al., 2016). These bursts are quantified, see the base Table 1. On day 
seventeen one sneeze/cough burst contains over 800 virions. 

3.3  Direct measurement of emissions and model outcomes: choice of Reference Person 
Measuring airborne single SARS virions is a tedious affair, first done in Toronto for SARS-1 (Booth et 
al., 2005) and now more often with SARS-2 (Qian et al., 2020). Recently, measurements of emissions 
by patients have been published by an international team (Ma et al., 2020). In not severely ill patients, 
in quarantine and hospitalized, they found a broad range of emissions, differing for a single person 
and between persons, ranging from 6 000 virions per hour to 600 000 virions per hour. Taking  the 
logarithmic mean as measurement reference, at 60 000 this level is like the Day 17 emissions of the 
model at 75 000 virions exhaled per hour. The 6 000 corresponds to Day 12 and 600 000 to Day 20/21. 
It seems that the orders of magnitude in model and measurement are not far off track, also related to 
the experience of the duration of pre-symptomatic and non-symptomatic spreading of viruses and the 
duration  of  the  illness  thereafter.  These  emission  outcomes  for  Day  17  are  next  used  in  the 
environmental  transmission  model  specifying  infection  routes  and  relative  volumes  of  potential 
infection. A sensitivity analysis, as with a tenfold higher production and emissions, is easily performed 
by simple multiplication. At an emission level of Day 21, the virion factory goes in overdrive and the 
patient will be seriously ill, probably in hospital, with well over one square meter of his alveoli infected. 
The reference person for environmental analysis is the Day 17 producer of 74 321 virions per hour. 
The  model  from  which  Table  1  is  derived  is  in  the  Supporting  Information  1  (SI1)  available  a 
www.scienceforstategies.com/SARS-Covid. The table gives an excerpt, with the Reference Person at 
Day 17 in red. Research by (Ivorra et al., 2020) indicates an average time lag from exposure to PCR 
measurable infection of around 10 days (from Figure 7).  At day 10 the person would be measurable 
ill and at day 17 the person would approach hospitalization, see Figure 7 in (Ivorra et al., 2020).

selected days 

3.4  Discussion on low spreading and super spreading 
The exponentially rising illness model suggests the following conclusions: 
-A small exposure leads to later severity of illness, with time for virus-specific defense mechanism to 
develop and bend the rising curve of the person. A high exposure reduces this time.  
-Well-developed generic defense mechanisms reduce the exponential rise, and weaker persons fall ill 
earlier and more severe. 
-virions production volume is not influenced by breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, or sneezing; 
only the mode of emission is. 
-Persons can differ very substantially in the number of virions produced and emitted. 
-Most emitters are asymptomatic, and illness may occur without coughing and sneezing.  
-Superspreaders may indeed emit more. However, in well documented cases the reason they infected 
many was primarily the highly different number of persons visiting them (Shen et al., 2004) p.258. 
(Shen et al., 2004) and similar (Lloyd-Smith, Schreiber, Kopp, & Getz, 2005) conclude that for many 
directly infectious illnesses it is environmental circumstances that may create the â20% creates 80%â 
rule. 

Environmental routes of SARS-2 from emissions through environment to exposures 

4  METHODS 2: Exposure Models 
4.1 
The  routes  to  exposure  cover  all  pathways  considered  in  the  literature.  The  environment 
characteristics have been reduced to generally occurring situations: relative humidity lower than 90% 
and temperature range not exceeding 30 degrees. Outside a light air of 1 meter per second, virtually 
no wind. Nine base routes are modeled mostly quantified. 
Number 1. Is transmission in a closed space (room, ward, cabin) for a longer duration, as in visiting a 
bar for 2 hours or staying with an infected person for 24 hours. Number 2 covers transmission person-
to-person directly, with normal exhalation at close distance in a still room. This version is generalized 
in 3, with transmission in a multi-person open space, with more turbulence. The bursts of sneeze and 
coughs are split, with number 4 covering the airborne part and number 5 the inhalation of the larger 
droplets. These droplets also from the basis of contaminating objects; route 6 exposure to fomites. 
Purely qualitative are the last three routes: the possible exposure to virions from other animals (7); 
from human excrements (8); and from eating food (9).

1. Transmission in a closed space (room, ward, cabin) 
The  closed  space  has  one  emitting  person.  Virions  decay  and  they  leave  the  room  by  ventilation. 
Virions which left  the  room donât  decay there  and virions  decayed cannot  leave  anymore. For the 
combined effects a model has been developed as an analogon to Ohmâs Law with two resistors, see 
SI4. The closed space is a 20m3 Reference Room with a Day 17 Reference Person exhaling 74321 virions 
per hour (Table 1) at start and rising by 2.5% per hour (doubling time 28 hours). Normal exhalation 
volume and hence inhalation volume is 0.5m3 per hour. The period covered is 24 hours starting with 
the ill person entering the virus-free room. There is no coughing and sneezing. Decay starts directly, 
as  exponential  reduction:  the  demise  of  one  virion  does  not  influence  the  demise  of  others.  The 
median  half-life  of  airborne  SARS-2  virions  is 1.1  hour  with (Van Doremalen et  al., 2020)  Figure  2. 
(Schuit et al., 2020) come to 90% reduction in 286 minutes: a half-life of 1.2 hours. (Smither, Eastaugh, 
Findlay,  &  Lever,  2020)  discern  situations  between  1-  and  3-hours  half-life.  They  all  refer  to 
mechanically aerosolized droplets under lab circumstances. (Schuit et al., 2020) measures 90% loss 
already at 19 minutes in winter and 8 minutes in summer, lab-simulated. (Fears et al., 2020) measured 
still viable SARS-2 virions in aerosols after 16 hours, which may be in line with any of the exponential 
reductions. A 2-hours half-life is used in modelling, with sensitivity analysis 1 and 2 hours, see table 2. 
Ventilation rates (VR, also: Air Change rate per Hour, ACH) vary widely. The minimum norm for Dutch 
schools  is  around  VR4  (5.5liter  fresh  air  per  hour  per  pupil)  but  is  not  measured  and  enforced.  In 
English schools, new at the time, (Coley & Beisteiner, 2002) measured VRs around 0.5. Residences and 
apartments are in the range of VR0.25 to VR2, with limited differences globally (Hou et al., 2019) Table 
1. Norms for residential and commercial buildings are substantially higher, see Wikipedia âAir Changes 
Per Hourâ. Operation theaters have a minimum VR of 30. The VR0.1; VR0.5, VR2; VR5; VR10; and VR20 
are used for concentration quantification. The concentration build-up in time is in Figure 3, leaving 
out  the  also  very  flat  VR10  and  VR20.  Without  ventilation,  the  half-life  determines  the  rising 
equilibrium concentration. With extreme ventilation, the half-life becomes irrelevant. See Figure 3 for 
the concentrations resulting, and item SI2 in the Supporting Information for the basic principles, at 
www.scienceforstrategies.com/SARS-Covid .

Version 29 October 2020 

The  number  of  virions  to  which  persons  joining  in  the  room  are  exposed  depends  on  the  time  of 
entering after the ill person and on the duration of stay. Staying with the person for 2 hours, starting 
at hour 0, hour 4, and at hour 12, are quantified for the exemplary VRs. Staying with an ill person in a 
room for 24 hours is the maximum exposure considered. See Table 2 for the outcomes (and the table 
covering HL1 and HL3 fully in SI2).

The Reference Room can cover many normal situations. The number of seats in a dining room of a 
restaurant is typically 1 per m2. With a ceiling 4m high the floor is 5m2, with then possibly 4 persons 
next to one Reference Person. With four ill persons, the fifth person would be exposed to a four times 
higher concentration. All are exposed equally in the well-mixed air in the room. The visitor to a bar 
with VR0.1 from hour 4-to-6 possibly inhales around 16 thousand virions, 20 times the infective dose 
of  800  virions.  The  start  date  of  illness  would  then  be  around    day  11  (see  table  1  and  SI1  in 
www.scienceforstrategies.com/sars-covid),  with  much  reduced  time  to  build  up  specific  defenses 
before severe illness. In rooms with not well-mixed air the virion concentration might even be higher 
locally.  Bad  mixing  occurs  mostly  with  low  VRs.  An  extreme  case  of  limited  mixing  results  from 
temperature inversion, quite common under bad ventilation, severest in not high rooms. The exhaled 
air there rises to the equilibrium mass density, possibly at standing height. That layer may have an 
order of magnitude higher virions concentration than well-mixed air (Zhou, Qian, Ren, Li, & Nielsen, 
2017), raising the potential exposure in the low ventilation rate pub even higher.  

2. Transmission person-to-person directly with normal exhalation 
The situation considered here is closed room with still air, hence with little or no ventilation. Normal 
exhalations of a healthy adult have a volume of around half a liter. Less healthy persons breath faster 
but with a similar volume over time. Deep inhalations and exhalations can double the tidal volume but 
halves the rate. Our standard person is infected but still quite healthy, on Day 17. It emits 74 virions 
per  exhalation  of  the  Standard  Person.  The  literature  gives  a  plume  at  exhalation  of  around  30 
degrees,  with  little  variation  in  (Gupta,  Lin,  &  Chen,  2010)  Table  2,  but  with  more  variation  and 
directional differences shown in (Xu, Nielsen, Liu, Jensen, & Gong, 2017) and (Olmedo, Nielsen, de 
Adana, Grzelecki, & Jensen, 2010). The plume cone has a virtual starting point set at 5cm inside mouth 
or nose. The center flow may be directed downward of fully upward in lying. It tends upwards due to 
lower density of the warm and moist exhalation. Mixing with air reduces the speed, with air transport 
and  turbulence  taking  over  in  spreading.  The  slowdown  is  to  around  20cm/s  at  40cm  already, 
irrespective of starting speed, see Figure 6 in (Xu et al., 2017). Quantification is based on an assumed 
exhale sphere. At 50 cm the sphere has a volume of 13 liter, and for the hypothetical spheres at 100 

10

Version 29 October 2020 

and 150cm they are 93 and 300 liter. Figure 4 depicts the expansion of an exhale, moving horizontally 
and vertically. 
The  maximum exposure  is  in  the  exhalation  flow  directly  in  the  face  of  the  receiving  person, who 
inhales in the exhalation flow fully. On average this can happen half of the time. That person inhales 
half of the half a liter from the 74 virions  sphere of 13 liter, that is around 1.3 virions per average 
inhalation. At 93 and 300 liter, the hypothetical inhalation reduces to 0.20 and 0.06 virions. Person-
to-person inhalations become more relevant if repeated very often, a route better approached by the 
closed room situation (1) or by the open space situation (3). 

Figure 4. Exhalation clouds expanding in closed spaces   

Figure 5. Exhalation clouds expanding in open air 

3. Transmission in a multi-person open space 
A standard open space  is defined here  as a large  surface with 1 person per m2  like in a well-filled 
terrace.  With  1%  ill  persons  there  is  an  average  distance  of  10  meters  between  them.  With  10% 
emitting,  a  high  estimate  at  the  peak  of  the  epidemic,  the  average  distance  reduces  to  3.3m. The 
average person will be at a safe distance, but some will stand closer and emitters may stand closer.  
For inhaled concentrations, the cone of the single person-to-person still room situation, see Figure 4, 
is starting point, to be adapted. Open air has more turbulence, mixing faster, the cone then spreading 
from  30  degrees  to  40  degrees,  and  the  plume  rising  at  10cm/s(Olmedo  Fig  3).  Horizontal  air 
movement  contributes  to  mixing.  The  unusually  low  wind  speed  of  1m/s  overrules  the  kinetics  of 
exhalations  already  (wind  100cm/s  versus  exhale  20cm/s).  Also  vertical  mixing,  over  hundreds  of 
meters, can be substantial, especially at day time (Zhang & Rao, 1999). More local mixing is by surface 
heating by solar irradiation, creating convective thermals and eddies. See for this and other physical 
mechanisms  (Vuorinen  et  al.,  2020)  p.17  and  (Olmedo  et  al.,  2010).  These  mechanisms  together 
determine the speed of exhale dilution, much higher than in a room with still air. Not all open spaces 
are equal. A partially open football stadium, protecting viewers from rain, may function as a very large, 
closed room, with number of emitters, presence time, and ventilation rate to be specified.  
The person-to-person inhalation situation at 50cm is uncomfortably close mostly, except for family 
and dear friends. Using the 40 degrees cone approach, a full inhalation at 1 meter gives a chance on 
inhalation of 0.08 virions, while staying in that exhalation plume for one hour, in the right direction, 
gives  79  virions  inhaled.  Staying  fully  in  the  assumed  plume  at  1.5m  for  a  full  hour,  even  more 
unrealistic, gives 25 virions inhaled. Reckoning with a faster rising and diluting plume in more normal 
outside  conditions  will  reduce  these  amounts  substantially,  while  higher  winds  and  solar  induced 
lead  to 
turbulence  reduce  exposure  even  further.  The  assumptions  used  may  therefore 

11

Version 29 October 2020 

overestimation  of  exposures  by  an  order  of  magnitude.  A  high  estimate  on  potential  exposure  at 
terrace or beach is therefore set at 8 virions for 1-hour stay. 

4. Transmission person-to-person in burst exhalations like cough and sneeze 
Coughs and sneezes emit the virions in two ways, as a normal exhalation airborne directly, and as 
droplets  escaping  in  mucus.  Mini-droplets,  below  5Âµm,  evaporate  near  instantaneously.  Larger 
droplets of 10Âµm evaporate to droplet nuclei within 0.3 second and of 100Âµm ( 0.1mm) within 1.3 
seconds, at 50% relative humidity, see (Vuorinen et al., 2020) p.6. Droplet nuclei, below 5Âµm,  stay 
airborne long-time. Coughs have far fewer droplets than the more diluted fluid sneezes, see Fig. 3 & 
4 in (Scharfman et al., 2016). Sneezes also have higher speeds with a more extended vortex, highest 
for  women  having  a  smaller  nose  opening.  All  visualizations  capture  larger  particles,  hardly  the 
submicron  ones.  The  not-airborne  particles  are  the  larger  droplets  which  fall  on  short  distance  (< 
50cm) by gravity (Bourouiba et al., 2014) Fig. 5.  
There  is  substantial  discussion  on  âmini-dropletsâ.  They  may  form  in  the  tubes  of  the  alveoli  and 
smallest bronchioli at closing after exhalation and opening at inhalation (Bake et al., 2019), directly 
from the alveoli, not mucus based. Or they may come indirectly from any virions caught in mucus on 
the epithelium in the respiratory system. The high air speed of the cough and sneeze in the higher 
airways may then pick them up and move them out, instead of the normal epithelial transport route 
(20cm  per  hour)  to  the  larynx  for  swallowing  (Sears,  Yin,  &  Ostrowski,  2015).  Measurements  on 
numbers are lacking. In larger droplets (>5Âµm) 30% are infected, below that size 40% (Vuorinen et al., 
2020) p.6, who also note that literature data are remarkably inconsistent. We assume here that the 
full 1-minute alveolar production of viable virions goes to mucus exhaled in one cough or sneeze. Part 
of  it  falls  in  larger  droplets  and  the  other  part  is  transported  in  the  vortex  cloud  and  ultimately 
evaporates.  We  assume  that  10%  of  mucus-based  exhale  falls  in  larger  droplets  and  90%  leaves 
airborne. Other distributions are possible, without much effect on inhaled numbers, but probably with 
different viability. 
For quantification we use the figure in the most recent publication (Bourouiba, 2020). There the burst 
vortex expands horizontally to 8 meter, much longer than in all previous publications, probably based 
on very humid and quite warm air, standing still in a lab. The quantification is based on one inhalation, 
full  in  the  sneeze  flow  at  1-meter  distance.  The  deep  exhalation  has  twice  the  normal  airborne 
number, that is 148 virions, while the 90% of the mucus-based airborne virions is 743, in total 893 
virions. These virions are dispersed in the sneeze sphere passing at 1 meter, with a diameter of 1 meter 
(measured from Figure) and a volume of 3m3. An extreme burst leads to fast extreme dilution. The 
inhalation takes half a liter from that sneeze sphere passing, that is 0.017% of 893 virions: 0.15 virions. 
It seems highly improbable that a person will be exposed fully to more than one sneeze burst. 

5. Transmission person-to-person by inhaling large droplets from exhalation bursts 
The larger droplets of cough/sneeze contain 10% of the exhaled mucus, see Route 4. By far the largest 
amount  is at sneezing where the mucal virions are diluted by the waterier sneeze. Larger droplets 
have  been  visualized  in  cough  and  sneeze  high  speed  pictures.  Using  the  most  detailed  picture 
available (Bourouiba et al., 2014) Fig.5, a rough estimate of the number of droplets can be made, in 
the order of 50. These 50 droplets from the Standard Person then contain 74 virions, 1.5 virions per 
droplet.  
For exposure we assume a person lying face-up on the back. As the droplet spree covers at least 1m2 
around the lying person and the nose openings together are not more than 5cm2, the chance of being 
hit by the 1.5 virion droplet is 5%. Droplets falling into the mouth would be swallowed directly. The 
large droplet caught in the nose will be partly transported by the epithelium towards the larynx for 

12 

 
 
 
 
Under review  

Version 29 October 2020 

indirect swallowing. The remainder, set at 50%, 0.75 virions, may infect the nose, where the same 
concentration  of  ACE2  receptor  cells  is  present  as  in  the  alveoli,  albeit  at  a  very  small  surface.  A 
common  cold  might  develop,  accompanied  by  anosmia  in  several  cases  (Yan,  Faraji,  Prajapati, 
Ostrander, & DeConde, 2020). There is no evidence of SARS-virion transmission from nose infection 
to  the  alveoli,  which  would  require  airborne  virion  production  in  the  nose.    Surface  spreading  is 
unlikely because there are hardly ACE2 receptor cells in the upper airways (Hamming et al., 2004), 
very different from influenza infection which spreads from the nose. When infected in then nose, the 
number of cells with ACE2 receptors increases fast, most probably as part of protective mechanisms 
against incoming viruses (Sungnak et al., 2020). As indirect evidence for an indirect pneumonia result 
is also lacking; the route to alveolar infection is highly improbable. The number of virions effectively 
reaching the alveoli is set at zero. 

6. Transmission by contact with contaminated objects: fomites  
Droplets,  especially larger  ones,  can fall on persons and objects, where  they can remain intact for 
longer  periods,  especially  on  very  smooth  surfaces  such  as  polished  stainless  steel,  see  (Van 
Doremalen et al., 2020) Table 1 and see the later survey by (Aboubakr, Sharafeldin, & Goyal, 2020). 
Viable SARS-2 virions remained detectable for up to several days, after exposure with larger amounts 
of lab produced viruses. Real life measurements in hospitals with SARS-1 patients showed extensive 
spread of virions, measured by PCR test, see (Dowell et al., 2004). However, no viable viruses could be 
gathered.  First  order  modelling  gives  a  similar  answer.  Assume  that  two  larger  cough  or  sneeze 
droplets of the total of 50 droplets have fallen at a certain smooth surface and stayed there, in total 3 
virions (2/50*74). Before their demise, one finger wipes them off, a main part of them, 2 virions. With 
a  less  smooth  surface  that  is  not  possible.  That  finger  is  brought  to  the  mouth  or  nose.  Mouth 
infections have not been reported. Destruction and swallowing with saliva may be expected. With a 
finger  containing 2 virions,  half of  them  might  be  smeared  into  the  nose  opening,  1  virion,  a  high 
estimate. Nose-epithelium will transport most virions to the larynx for swallowing, but not this one, 
then remaining available for local infection. A nose infection is possible if that one virion overcomes 
the normal defenses against infection, which is extremely improbable. The net direct intake to the 
alveoli for pneumonia is set at zero. 

7. Transmission by human excrements 
Infected excrements have widely been documented, see (Wang et al., 2020) and (Heneghan, 
Spencer, Brassey, & Jefferson, 2020). Stool can be infected from production of virions in the small 
intestines, the second largest potential production site after the alveoli. The intestines can produce 
virions after the last positive test of respiratory samples, up to well over a month (Wu et al., 2020), 
and have shown to be viable for infection in SARS1 and MERS. Stool PCR  tests are equally usable for 
checking on a personâs infection as nasal swabs (JingCheng Zhang, Wang, & Xue, 2020). This orofecal 
route has not been substantiated for SARS-2 but remains a serious possibility, so they state. The 
intestine infection can be by the oral route or by transport from the alveoli in the blood stream, or 
the other way around.  
The amount and period of infection at a local population level can be indicated by the number of 
SARS-2 virion parts in the sewer system measured by PCR, see (Medema, Heijnen, Elsinga, 
Italiaander, & Brouwer, 2020). These are assumed not to be viable for infection anymore. Stool can 
spread to mouth and nose of other persons, especially in care situations. Stool might also be 
aerosolized in flushing toilets (Johnson, Lynch, Marshall, Mead, & Hirst, 2013), but has not been 
documented in relation to SARS-2. However, in several instances in hospitals higher concentrations 
of airborne SARS-2 has been measured in toilet rooms. 

13 

 
 
 
 
Under review  

Version 29 October 2020 

Cases  of  intestine  infection  leading  to  a  new  alveoli  infection,  with  pneumonia,  have  not  been 
documented or indicated. Direct intestine infection has been documented in MERS, see (Shi, Sun, & 
Hu, 2020) p.942. The primary intestine infection might be a serious issue but as yet not substantiated 
route, signaled as (!!!!) in Table 3. 

8. Transmission from other animal species to persons 
Zoonotic  transmission  forms  the  basis  for  the  new  SARS-2  infection  in  humans,  with  the  ultimate 
reservoir in bats. The spread is however mainly human to human, as in SARS-1. In MERS the spread 
was also between camels and humans. Animals with ACE2 receptors and mutual infections are several, 
see the survey in (Opriessnig & Huang, 2020). Living in close vicinity with humans are cats and ferrets, 
as  quite  popular  pets  and  as  farmed  for  their  fur.  They  have  been  infected  by  humans  and  have 
symptoms like humans. There are no known cases of cat to human infection yet, but close contact for 
a longer duration is not uncommon. There is some slight evidence that cat fleas can carry the virus, 
and visit other animals (Villar et al., 2020). Farmed ferrets have been infected by their caretakers with 
human  SARS-2  and  large-scale  mutual  infection  has  been  established  in  ferret  farms  in  the 
Netherlands (production 5 million per year). There is no research yet on inhalation risks of keeping 
them as pets, which is widespread in the US, third place after dogs and cats. Dogs are less prone to 
infection, while pigs, chickens and ducks are not prone to infection (Jianzhong Shi et al., 2020). There 
are  many  non-household  animals  prone  to  infection,  with  armadillos,  Syrian  hamsters  and  rhesus 
macaques used in experiments as examples (Shan et al., 2020). 
Though of some concern, the risk of exposure from these sources seems very low, with a possible 
exception for ferrets kept as pets; warning (!!). 

9. Transmission by food 
Many wild animals are eaten, including those that can carry SARS-2, with armadillos as an example 
(Shan et al., 2020), and some are raised for eating, as dogs in many countries. Also ferrets after having 
been cleaned of their fur are animal fodder, possibly ending up higher in the food chain. Another route 
is by contamination of food, by human droplets and stool and stool from any SARS-2 infected animal, 
such as cats, ferrets, and several other rodents. SARS-2 virions have been found on frozen food, where 
they might remain long time viable, till thawing. There then is an exposure route to intestine infection 
by eating raw food, and a route to nose infection by handlers of the food as a fomite. The number of 
virions involved might be much larger than with objects contaminated by cough and sneeze droplets.  
There are no documented cases yet where the SARS virus has been transmitted by food. The risk of 
SARS-2 pneumonia by consuming food containing virions seems therefore low, and then might lead 
to a primary intestinal infection. The risks will be highest with persons handling the contaminated food 
very  regularly    or  eating  just  unfrozen  food  raw.  Developing  SARS-2  pneumonia  from  food  seems 
extremely improbable, flagged but set at Zero. 

5  RESULTS 2: Potential exposures 
5.1  Routes to exposure compared 
Table 3 integrates exposures results (see the excel files in SI3 at www.scienceforstrategies.com/SARS-
Covid ). The relative risks of the routes to exposure differ by six orders of magnitude. Staying in the 
standard room with an ill person for two hours or longer always poses a serious risk, even with good 
ventilation  (VR5),  which  is  not  reached  in  many  current  situations,  not  even  in  many  schools,  see

Version 29 October 2020 

6  DISCUSSION: Models and Exposures 
6.1  Restrictions in models and data. 
Several shortcomings are present now, and only partly repairable.  
The exponential infection model in Methods 1 does not reckon with persons with lower or higher non-
specific defense mechanisms as related to higher or lower speed to illness. Sensitivity analysis would 
be useful as data are lacking. Indirect information may come up in the coming months and years. 
The closed space model has been developed after Ohmâs Law. Better models might be developed or 
adapted from other domains. 
The exhalationâinhalation models follow the cones approach from the literature for quantification, 
with spheres growing when expanding through the cone, and the cone opening increasing from 30 
degrees to 40 degrees with turbulence. These models seem overly simplistic and empirically linked to 
lab situations only.  
The most recent empirical sneeze model (Bourouiba, 2020) forms the basis for sneeze quantifications, 
at 1-meter distance and for droplets, but might be related to special circumstances like extreme still-
standing warm and humid air.  
Real-life quantified measurements of viable virions will remain extremely burdensome and costly. 
Therefore, quantified measurement of actual virions in flows beyond hospitals and labs is lacking, and 
key variables like virions half-life in realistic airborne and fomite situations are lacking as well. 
Routes from fomites to actual intake to mouth and nose have never been measured, making claims 
on this route yet ill-supported. 

From standard persons and standard situations to more realistic versions 

6.2 
Resolving these restrictions for more adequate and realistic modelling will take time. For now, better 
sensitivity analysis on key variables is a main option.  
Sensitivity analysis for choice of Standard Person Day 17 will increase all exposures proportionally but 
with  all  relative  scores  the  same.  Wide  variations  would  bring  the  dynamic  model  in  a  highly 
improbable domain, reaching death much sooner or hardly at all.  
Changing the distribution of primary virion production over the airborne and mucal outflows will also 
leave the relative scores mainly intact.  
The closed room routes did not cover ventilation air moved to other rooms as a source of exposure, 
widely discussed and often inferred from infections (see SI6). A most serious case would be a fresh air 
ventilation rate of only 50%, quite common, with the other half coming from the closed room cases. 
Then  concentrations  in  the  next  room  would  be  half  of  the  closed  room  case,  in  many  cases  still 
serious.  
The fomite infection route discussed indicates that few virions can effectively be brought into the nose 
at most. Real-life experiments could show some evidence, as is present for the very different influenza 
virus. Could such routes be established for SARS-2? 

From exposure to infection 

6.3 
Exposure to virions has been set  equal for all forms. In terms of infectiveness there are very large 
differences, however. Medicine research (Brown et al., 2002) has shown that finest particles reach 
deeper into the lungs than fine particles, UFPs against PM2.5 in air pollution language. Single SARS 
virions, 120 nanometer diameter, are UFPs. Evaporated droplets, droplet nuclei, are up to 5Âµm, larger 
even than PM2.5, while the maximum particle size reaching alveoli is 3Âµm, see (Talaat & Xi, 2017), 
especially p.20 and Figure 12. Inhaled medicines come deeper the smaller their size is, with the share 
of UFPs highest, again the smallest coming deepest. So, it is not just the number of virions exposed to 
but  also  their  size  in  determining  the  risk  on  SARS-2  pneumonia.  Larger  droplet  nuclei  will  play  a 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
Under review  

Version 29 October 2020 

smaller role per virion than single virions as they are caught more in the upper airways, see also (Mittal 
et al., 2020) p.894. The number of virions per mini-droplet and droplet nucleus is not known in relation 
to their size, nor is their viability. Here they have been counted equal. Transport models developed 
for medicine application could improve infection modelling. 
Infection of alveoli requires virions to pass the tracks, never established for SARS-2, as by contrast for 
influenza.  The  flu  spreads  in  these  tracks  and  destructs  the  protective  layers  there,  including  by 
macrophages (Ghoneim, Thomas, & McCullers, 2013). The pneumonia ultimately resulting is not viral 
as with COVID-19, but bacterial, mostly Streptococcus Pneumoniae. Could the viral infection routes 
be established for the different forms of SARS-2? 

From analysis to technical and policy measures 

6.4 
Exposure prevention measures  have  not  been investigated here, nor have medicines. Ill ventilated 
spaces are of prime concern, especially where several ill and highly emitting persons could be present. 
Options  differ  deeply  between  personal  short-term  measures  like  good  masks  in  badly  ventilated 
spaces, to long-term collective measures such as effective standards for virus-free ventilation in all 
public buildings and transport spaces, and also in private buildings. 

7  Conclusions: SARS-2 Risks 
1.  The outcomes indicate clearly where measures may be more useful, much less so, or not at all.  
2.  All long stay situations in closed rooms, also with reasonable to good ventilation VR2 to VR5, pose 
a risk of exposure, by up to well over 10,000 virions. This seems enough for severe infection. 
Incidental  and  short  period  exposures  are  well  below  the  1000  virions  boundary,  referring  to 
extreme maximum intakes only: in still, warm and humid air inhaling the exhale of ill persons face-
to-face many times.  

3. 

4.  Keeping 150cm distance in a well-mixed room does not protect against risky exposure, except with 

high ventilation rates, where distance does not matter much. 

5.  All  outside  exposures  and  all  contact  exposures,  as  with  fomites  and  large  droplets,  lead  to 
negligible potential exposure, including extreme sneeze bursts fully inhaled at 1-meter distance. 
6.  Norms on ventilation rates, often too low, differ an order of magnitude from actual ventilation 
rates, which can result in extreme concentration, exposure, and risk differences, especially in the 
range of lower VRs. 

7.  The SARS-2 models  developed here  show the strength of Industrial Ecology to engage  in mass 
balancing  beyond  industrial  and  natural  systems.  Detailed  medical  and  epidemiological 
knowledge and models may be linked to them by others for a more integrated view.
