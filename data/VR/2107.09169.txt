Abstract—The recent extra-large scale massive multiple-input
multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems are seen as a promising
technology for providing very high data rates in increased
user-density scenarios. Spatial non-stationarities and visibility
regions (VRs) appear across the XL-MIMO array, since its
large dimension is of the same order of the distances to the
user-equipments (UEs). Due to the increased density of UEs in
typical applications of XL-MIMO systems and the scarcity of
pilots, the design of random access (RA) protocols and scheduling
algorithms become challenging. In this paper, we propose a joint
RA and scheduling protocol, namely non-overlapping VR XL-
MIMO (NOVR-XL) RA protocol, which takes advantage of the
different VRs of the UEs for improving RA performance, besides
of seeking UEs with non-overlapping VRs to be scheduled in the
same payload data pilot resource. Our results reveal that the
proposed scheme achieves signiﬁcant gains in terms of sum-rate
compared with traditional RA schemes, as well as reducing access
latency and improving connectivity performance as a whole.

I. INTRODUCTION

Unusual channel conditions are seen in the recent extra-large
(XL-MIMO)
scale massive multiple-input multiple-output
technology [1]. By distributing the antenna elements in a
wide space, like in the facades of buildings, stadiums, or
shopping malls, the distance between user equipments (UEs)
and the base station (BS) antennas might become of the
same order of the array dimension, giving rise to spatial non-
stationarities, in which the received signal energy of a given
UE varies signiﬁcantly accross the array [1]–[6]. Besides, since
different regions of the large-aperture array see different sets
of scatterers, obstacles, and UEs, the concept of visibility
regions (VRs) is introduced in this channel model [4]. Through
the concept of VRs, some antennas, sometimes grouped in
i.e., receive
subarrays (SAs), are visible by a given UE,
signiﬁcant signal energy, while other antennas are not [1]–[6].
Some envisioned services within the future sixth generation
of wireless networks (6G) will demand a highly efﬁcient
method to deal with massive UE access attempts, as massive

Machine Type Communication (mMTC) and crowded Mobile
Broadband (cMBB) [7]. In these scenarios, the number of
available pilot sequences is lower than the number of UEs.
Therefore, implementing efﬁcient random access (RA) proto-
cols becomes essential to allow coherent communication. An
important RA protocol for spatially stationary massive MIMO
systems is proposed in [8], namely the strongest user collision
resolution (SUCRe) protocol. This protocol aims to resolve
RA pilot collisions by selecting the UE with the strongest
signal gain to repeat its pilot after the collision, in a completely
decentralized and uncoordinated fashion [8].

Extending [8],

the authors in [9] propose an idle pilot
access (SUCR-IPA) protocol, which allows a fraction of the
users that failed to access the BS to re-select their pilots by
means of an access class barring (ACB) factor, alleviating
pilot collision. Another extension can be found in [10], in
which a graph-based pilot access (SUCR-GBPA) protocol is
proposed, allowing all users that lost the contention resolution
to randomly select a new pilot. Besides, in [11], the SUCRe
protocol is modiﬁed to include a non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) approach. The proposed NOMA-RA protocol
allows to resolve collisions between users who try to access
the medium using the same pilot signal, distinguishing them in
the power domain and achieving a better sum-rate performance
with lower average delay in comparison with the traditional
SUCRe scheme.

In the SUCRe protocol, the UE repeats its RA pilot in step 3
if it judges itself as the strongest contending UE, otherwise it
stays silent. This can be seen as a hard decision, as described
in [12]. As an improvement, the authors in [12] derive the
probability of each UE being the strongest contender, based
on information available at the UE side. Then, in the proposed
Soft-SUCRe protocol, the UE repeats or not its chosen RA
pilot in step 3 according to this probability, achieving sig-
niﬁcant performance improvements in overcrowded scenarios,
i.e., when the average number of accessing UEs is higher than
the number of available RA pilots.

An important drawback of the original SUCRe protocol is
its lack of fairness, since the strongest user retransmission
criterion improves the connectivity performance of the UEs
closer to the BS, while the farther UEs typically present
increased probabilities of failed access attempts. In [13],
the authors propose the ACB with power control (ACBPC)
protocol, which is able to provide a good RA performance for
all UEs, independently of their distances to the BS, improving
the RA performance for a substantial fraction of UEs within
the cell in comparison with SUCRe.

The SUCRe protocol has been recently adapted to the
XL-MIMO scenario in [14], in the so called SUCRe-XL. By

 
 
 
 
 
 
allowing different UEs to access the network through the same
RA pilot, provided that the respective UE channels result
in non-overlapping VRs across the XL array of antennas,
this protocol achieves signiﬁcant improvements in terms of
reducing access latency and the fraction of failed access
attempts in overcrowded scenarios. However, the SUCRe-XL
RA protocol does not perform any speciﬁc action in the sense
of favoring the communication of UEs with non-overlapping
VRs channels by employing the same pilot, while expecting
this to occur only at random.

the proposed protocol

Contribution: This paper proposes a joint RA and schedul-
ing protocol for crowded XL-MIMO systems, named Non-
Overlapping VR XL-MIMO (NOVR-XL) random access pro-
tocol. Different than other works regarding RA protocols,
which terminate the analysis when the UE succeeds in the
RA, we also look at the post-RA stage, in which payload data
pilots are scheduled to the UEs that succeeded in the RA stage.
Due to the randomly distributed obstacles, scatterers, and UEs,
different UEs might have different VRs conﬁgurations. In
the RA stage, more than one UE may contend for the same
RA pilot, giving rise to a pilot collision. Our protocol takes
advantage of the random VR conﬁguration of the different UEs
to admit them to the network. Once a new UE is admitted
to the network,
tries to allocate a
payload data pilot already in use by another UE, but with
non-overlapping VRs. In this way, the proposed procedures not
only improve the RA system performance, but also increase
the sum-rate, since more UEs can be connected to the same
payload data pilot in an interference-free manner, thanks to the
large extension of the XL antenna array. Furthermore, another
important advantage of our proposed NOVR-XL protocol is
that it is just a 2-step RA protocol, different than SUCRe-based
ones which require four steps, allowing thus an appreciable
access latency reduction.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

We consider a time-division-duplexing (TDD) system, in
which a BS operates equipped with an extra-large uniform
linear array (ULA) with M antenna-elements. Similarly as
in [2], [14], we consider a simpliﬁed bipartite graph model,
being the array divided into B SAs, each with Mb = M/B
antennas. Let we deﬁne
as the set of all the BS subarrays
the subset of SAs visible to k-th UE. For the
and
sake of mathematical modeling, we assume that the subset

is generated at random, where each SA follows a Bernoulli
distribution with success probability Pb. This probability re-
produces the effect of random obstacles and scatterers in the
environment, which interact with the signals transmitted by/to
the UEs, giving rise to the VRs. Thus, each SA is visible with
probability Pb, allowing also a binary vector representation
ZB×1 for the VR of every UE, in which vk,b = 1 if the
vk
b-th SA is visible by UE k, and 0 otherwise. It is important to
note that when an antenna is visible by some user, this means
that the user can transmit/receive signals to/from this antenna
with a non-zero channel gain, not necessarily implying in the

The time-frequency resources are divided into coherence
blocks of T channel uses, dimensioned such that the channel
responses between the BS and UEs are constant and frequency
ﬂat within each block, while varying between blocks. This
time-frequency organization can be implemented with orthog-
onal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). Similarly as
in [8], the coherence blocks are divided into two categories:
payload data blocks and RA blocks. The blocks in the ﬁrst
category are used for uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) payload
data transmission by the users in the subset

been already allocated a temporary dedicated PDP sequence

The above XL-MIMO channel model assumes a non-line-of-

[2], [4], [14], [16]. This assumption can be justiﬁed in practice
for scenarios where a large number of obstacles and scatterers
takes place between UEs and the BS.

The sum-rate metric is very useful
in order to compare
different RA protocols, since it takes into account the number
of channel uses spent per attempt, the number of RA attempts
that the UEs are requiring to connect, and the number of active
UEs that the protocol can admit to the network. Furthermore,
since τPD always coincide in our model to the number of PDP
since
temporarily allocated to the active UEs, and τPD ≤ |A|
the same PDP can be allocated to different active UEs if their
VRs are non-overlapping, the sum-rate metric also quantiﬁes
the capability of the scheduling algorithm in ﬁnding UEs with
orthogonal VRs to allocate the same PDP.

which contains the combined VRs of UEs allocated to each
PDP sequence. The combined VRs related to each allocated
PDP is simply the sum of the VRs of the UEs using it. Since
the system starts to operate, for each UE k succeeding in the
RA stage, the BS ﬁrst seeks for a line in F that is orthogonal
to vk. By denoting the j-th line of F by fj , this operation
is equivalent to ﬁnding fj vk = 0. Once this condition is

In summary, the original SUCRe-XL protocol from [14]
does not provide to the BS an explicit information about the
VRs of the UEs. Therefore, each UE admitted to the network
has to be temporarily allocated an exclusive PDP sequence to
it, such that
. On the other hand, in the mSUCRe-XL
protocol discussed herein, little overhead is added in the step 3
of the RA protocol, aiming to allow a more efﬁcient scheduling
of PDP resources, such that
. Moreover, the sum-rate
metric in (4) is numerically evaluated in the next section, and
the presented results can answer if the re-allocation of PDPs
to UEs with non-overlapping VRs compensates the additional
RA overhead required.

A. Variant of SUCRe-XL RA protocol: Re-allocating PDPs
due to Orthogonal VRs

Besides considering the SUCRe-XL RA protocol as pro-
posed in [14], for performance comparison in the next section,
we also consider a variant of this protocol denominated modi-
ﬁed SUCRe-XL (mSUCRe-XL) RA protocol, with the aim of
leveraging non-overlapping VRs features. In this variant, the
four steps of the SUCRe-XL protocol are performed similarly
as in [14], except that, in step 3, the re-transmitting UEs
transmit together with their repeated RA pilot the additional
vk, estimated from the modiﬁed
information vector containing
broadcast signal in step 0. If the collision is successfully
resolved, the BS can decode such information and gets to
b
know the VR of this new UE. Then, the BS is able to run
our proposed scheduling procedure described in Algorithm 1
in order to seek a PDP sequence allocated to active UEs whose
combined VRs are orthogonal to that of UE k. This variant
serves as a challenging opponent to the proposed NOVR-XL
RA protocol.

it

Finally,

is worth mentioning that SUCRe-XL and
mSUCRe-XL RA protocols require four steps since they rely
on the strongest user retransmission criterion, i.e., only one
UE (with the strongest channel gain) retransmits the RA pilot
in step 3, resolving the collision. For this purpose, it is required
the DL pilot transmission in step 2, allowing the UEs to
estimate the sum of contenders’ signal gains, and then judging
if it is the strongest. This approach is not effective from the
connectivity perspective, since its objective is to connect only
one UE per RA pilot; also, it is unfair, since such UE is the
one closer to the BS, while increases access latency, since
four steps are required. Contrarily, our proposed NOVR-XL
protocol does not rely on the strongest user retransmission
criterion; hence,
the RA attempt for a UE will be successful
if their RA message can be decoded from at least one SA,
which is likely to occur due to the different random VRs of
the UEs in the XL-MIMO system. As a result, more UEs can
connect through the same RA pilot resource, improving RA
performance in just 2 steps, since no DL pilot transmission is
required, reducing access latency.

IV. SINR IN THE NOVR-XL PROTOCOL

This section develops analytical expressions for the uplink
and downlink SINR of the proposed NOVR-XL protocol.
We start analyzing the probability of a speciﬁc UE channel
generates a visible region under an exclusive SA. Hence, the
expressions for the SINR in step 1 (UL) and step 2 (DL) of
the proposed algorithm are obtained analytically.

A. Probability of a UE having an exclusive SA

6∈ V

k and b

We ﬁrst evaluate the probability of an SA b being ex-
clusively visible by UE k, among the UEs contending for
k′ ,
the same RA pilot. In this case, b
k′
= k. This condition is very desirable for our
∀
proposed NOVR-XL protocol, because it provides reliable
channel estimates in that SA, and, consequently, reliable com-
munication links for that UE in both directions. This makes
very likely that the BS will properly decode the information
message sent by the UE in step 1, besides of allowing the
BS to transmit in step 2 information about the PDP being
allocated for it. However, it is important to note that even if
no SA is exclusively visible by UE k among its contenders,
there is still a chance for its information message sent in step 1
being successfully decodable. This is the case when the k-th
UE presents a strong predominant channel gain in certain SA b
w.r.t. its contenders, so that the channel estimate in (9) for this
SA, although partially contaminated, is of sufﬁcient quality for
an appropriate decoding of the additional information from this
UE. All these possibilities are discussed in the SINR analysis
conducted in Subsection IV-B.

From the system model in Section II, the probability of SA
b being visible by UE k is Pb; therefore, given a number of
UEs
contending for the same RA pilot, the probability of
the SA b being exclusively visible to it can be written as

some manipulations, we obtain the UL SINR in (16). One
can recognize the ﬁrst term in the denominator as the directed
interference in the case of a contending UE also having the b-th
SA visible, which can be seen as a coherent RA interference.
The second term can thus be seen as a non-coherent RA
interference, and relates to the product of the variance of the
channel estimate with the variance of the received signal at
the b-th SA in step 1.

Fig. 3 depicts the probability of the UE having at least one
SA exclusively visible by it. As one can see, such probability
achieves appreciable values for a not so large number of UEs
contending for the same RA pilot. This corroborates the idea
of the proposed NOVR-XL protocol in taking advantage of
the reliable channel links in the RA stage for increasing the
number of UEs admitted to the network.

B. SINR of the UL Information in Step 1

We derive herein the SINR performance for the UL data

the ℓ-th term (ℓ = 1, . . . , nu) of this estimation in (15).

Then, following the analysis in [17], we compute the expected
power of each term in (15) as the expectation of its squared
magnitude. This result is shown in Table I, in terms of the
squared mean and variance of each component. Then, taking
only E[

conditions simultaneously hold: i) UEs k and k′ chose the

k; iii) SA b is visible by UE k′: b

since β(b)

by that SA.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We assume a circular cell as depicted in Fig. 1, with re =
200m and ri = 20m. Each UE wants to become active with
probability Pa = 0.01, randomly choosing one RA pilot out
of τRA = 10 pilots available. The BS is a ULA located in
the center of the cell where M = 400 antennas are uniformly
distributed along a 40 m length array, and divided into B SAs,
each visible by a UE with probability Pb = 0.5. The employed
XL-MIMO scenario is very similar to that assumed in [14].

Simulations are generated in sequential RA blocks, which
are represented by 104 Monte Carlo realizations. In each
round, new iUEs realize an access attempt following (5). UEs
that failed at the ﬁrst attempt retransmit their RA pilots with
probability 0.5 in the next blocks. It is considered a failed
access attempt if a UE do not succeed in a total of 10 RA
attempts, starting from its ﬁrst transmission.

A. Random Access Performance

We compare in Fig. 4 the average number of access attempts
and the probability of failed access attempts as a function
of the number of iUEs, considering our proposed NOVR-XL
RA protocol, SUCRe-XL [14], and mSUCRe-XL as discussed
in Subsection III-A. Note that SUCRe-XL and mSUCRe-XL
achieve the same RA performance, differing only in terms
of sum-rate. When obtaining these results we assumed that
there is always an available PDP to be allocated for a UE that
succeeded in the RA stage. Besides, for the proposed NOVR-
the UL RA additional
XL RA protocol we assumed that
information vector of UE k can be successfully decoded from
dul
SA b if the UL SINR of
k in (10), as described in (16), is
greater than a threshold of 0 dB. In this case, the BS assumes
that reliable channel estimates are available for this UE in this

successfully decoding the messages since this is a reasonable
value for decoding uplink control information (UCI) in the
physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) for most allowed
transmit formats in 5G [18].

DL signal received at the UE k in step 4.

As one can see from Fig. 4, the proposed NOVR-XL proto-
col achieves signiﬁcant improved RA performance in compar-
ison with SUCRe-based protocols. For instance, considering
K = 2000 iUEs, and B = 10 SAs, the average number of
access attempts decreases from ¯µRA = 8.064 attempts for
SUCRe-XL to ¯µRA = 6.363 attempts for NOVR-XL. In the
same way, the probability of failed access attempts decreases
from 0.7393 to 0.5505, representing a signiﬁcant performance
improvement of the NOVR-XL protocol in (over)crowded
mMTC scenarios.

Remark 1: It is noteworthy that the result discussed above is
in accordance with the Markov’s inequality [19]. Deﬁning the
random variable µk

performed, the Markov bound can be readily applied as:

In [14], authors assumed that the RA attempt is successful
for SUCRe-XL if only one UE retransmits its chosen pilot
in the step 3 of that protocol, or if the UEs retransmitting
the same pilot have non-overlapping VRs. Herein, for a fair
comparison, we have assumed that the UL signal received
at the BS in step 3 of SUCRe-XL protocol is successfully
decoded in SA b if its SINR is above a threshold of 0 dB. As
a result, the channel estimates processed in such SA for this
UE are used for precoding its DL signal in step 4. Finally,
the UE has its RA attempt successful if the SINR of the DL
signal received in step 4 is above a threshold of 0 dB. In order
to obtain the SINR of the UL signal received at the SA b in
step 3 of SUCRe-XL protocol, and the SINR of the DL signal
received at the UE k in step 4, we need to ﬁrst deﬁne the set
t, composed by the indices of the UEs retransmitting the RA
R
pilot t in step 3 of that protocol. Besides, we deﬁne the set
, composed by the indices of all UEs retransmitting any RA

XL protocol can be obtained by (16), but replacing

In order to evaluate the sum-rate performance of the investi-
gated protocols, we need ﬁrst to obtain appropriate values for
ϕRA, i.e., the number of channel uses spent per RA attempt of
each RA protocol. In the SUCRe-XL protocol [14], the four
steps present a very similar structure to that of medium access
control in 5G, as described in [20]. Therefore, we can use this
document as reference. In SUCRe-XL, the UE transmits an RA
pilot in step 1, spending τRA channel uses. The BS responds in
step 2 with the precoded RA response, composed by the DL
RA pilot, the RA resource network temporary identiﬁer (RA-
RNTI), and a timing advance (TA) information. While the
DL RA pilot transmission spends τRA channel uses, the RA-
RNTI and TA are of 16 and 8 bits length [20], respectively.
For simplicity, we assume in our analysis that the modulation
and coding scheme (MCS) employed is chosen resulting in
a unitary MCS spectral efﬁciency3. Therefore, the number of
channel uses in step 2 is 24+τRA. The UE transmits in step 3
the repeated RA pilot (τRA channel uses) and the cell radio
network temporary identiﬁer (C-RNTI), of 16 bits [20], such
that the number of channel uses in this step is 16+τRA. Finally,
in step 4, the BS responds with the C-RNTI and the contention
resolution information (CRI), of 48 bits [20], such that the
number of channel uses in this step is 64. In summary, for
SUCRe-XL, ϕSUCRe−XL

= 104 + 3τRA.

the mSUCRe-XL RA protocol discussed in Sec-
tion III-A, the signals transmitted in the four steps of the RA
vk is
stage are very similar to that of SUCRe-XL, except that
transmitted in step 3. Such estimate is a binary vector of length
B, and thus we assume its transmission requires B channel
uses. Therefore, we have that ϕmSUCRe−XL
= 104+B +3τRA.

Finally, for the proposed NOVR-XL protocol, in the RA
stage we assume the UE transmits in step 1 its chosen RA
vk,
pilot, an identiﬁer information (ID) with 16 bits, and
spending 16 + B + τRA channel uses at this step. Then, the BS
responds in step 2 with the identiﬁer information, followed by
TA and CRI, spending at this step 72 channel uses. Therefore,
we have that ϕNOVR−XL
= 88+B +τRA. Table II summarizes
the number of channel uses per RA attempt for each protocol
under consideration.

As one can see, the proposed NOVR-XL protocol achieves
the best sum-rate performance, with substantial improvements
in comparison with mSUCRe-XL and SUCRe-XL. The Fig-
ure also shows that mSUCRe-XL outperforms SUCRe-XL,
indicating that the application of our proposed scheduling
procedure described in Algorithm 1 compensates the overhead
vk. In terms of sum-rate, this
required by the transmission of
occurs because more UEs can be scheduled in the same PDP
sequence, requiring a smaller set of PDP sequences, and little

NOVR-XL protocol is able to manage a substantially higher
number of active UEs in the network, due to the better
connectivity performance in the RA stage, as presented in
Fig. 4. Furthermore, the Figure reveals that
the proposed
scheduling procedure for non-stationary XL-MIMO systems
in Algorithm 1 is very effective in terms of simultaneously
allocating the same PDP resource to different UEs, provided

that they present non-overlapping VRs. In the case of NOVR-
XL protocol, on average up to 1.274 UEs can be scheduled
in the same PDP resource. The mSUCRe-XL RA protocol
also achieves a good number of active UEs connected in the
same PDP sequence for low/moderate number of iUEs, but its
limited RA performance in (over)crowded scenarios reduces
the number of active UEs in such cases.

VI. FINAL REMARKS

XL-MIMO systems are a new topology which promises
appreciable performance improvements for 5G and 6G sys-
tems. However, many difﬁculties have to be overcome in
order to make this technology applicable in practice. This
paper addresses the problems of RA and resource scheduling,
proposing a joint RA and scheduling protocol which takes
advantage of the random VRs of the UEs for improving both
the
performance metrics. Our numerical results show that

connectivity performance is substantially improved, reducing
the average number of access attempts and the probability of
failed access attempts. Then, a detailed analysis of each RA
protocol indicated the number of channel uses spent per RA
attempt. This has allowed a sum-rate performance analysis,
able to measure in a uniﬁed way the overhead of each protocol,
its connectivity performance, and its capability of managing
a large number of active UEs, requiring for this the smallest
possible set of PDP sequences. Again, the proposed NOVR-
XL protocol presented very improved performance results,
showing that an increased number of active UEs can be
supported at the same time, hence, demanding a smaller set
of PDPs, taking advantage of the non-overlapping VRs of the
UEs. Therefore, our proposed protocol is able to reduce access
latency in the same time it improves the XL-MIMO system
sum-rate.
