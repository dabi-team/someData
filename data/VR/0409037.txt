ABSTRACT

We present a wide ﬁeld CCD photometric study of Galactic globular cluster

NGC 7492. The derived V R color-magnitude diagram extends down to about 3.5

mag below the cluster main sequence turn-oﬀ. The ﬁeld covers 42′ × 42′ about

3 times larger than the known tidal radius of this cluster. The sample of cluster

member candidates obtained by CMD-mask process has been used to construct

luminosity and mass functions and surface density map. NGC 7492 has a very

ﬂat mass function with very little variation in the slope with the distance from

the cluster center. However, there is a clear evidence for the increase of the slope

of the mass function from inner to outer regions, indicating a mass segregation

of the cluster. The surface density map of NGC 7492 shows extensions toward

the Galactic anticenter (northeast) and northwest from the cluster center. A

comparison of luminosity function for stars in the tails with that for stars within

the tidal radius suggests that the extensions shown in the surface density map

could be a real feature. The overall shape of NGC 7492 is signiﬁcantly ﬂattened.

If the ﬂattened shape of the NGC 7492 is caused by its rotation, Galactic tidal

ﬁeld must have given important inﬂuences, since the initial rotation would have

been almost completely removed by dynamical relaxation.

INTRODUCTION

Globular clusters have attracted considerable attentions for the understanding of the

process of Galaxy formation because they are thought to be fossil relics from the early

formation history of the Galaxy. It is now well known that the globular clusters we see today

may be only the survivors of an initial population. From the calculations of destruction

rate, Lee & Goodman (1995) and Gnedin & Ostriker (1997) predicted that possibly as many

as half of the present day Galactic globular clusters would be destroyed in the next Hubble

time. Two body relaxation makes the velocity distribution of stars in a globular cluster

toward a Maxwellian. As some stars acquire enough energy to escape from the cluster, the

total mass slowly decreases (Spitzer & Thuan 1972). The evaporation is also accelerated

by the energy equipartition process which makes all stars have the same kinetic energy. It

causes the mass segregation through which high-mass stars sink toward the central region of

the cluster while low-mass stars have higher velocities and tend to occupy the outer region

of the cluster (Spitzer 1987). Therefore mass segregation leads to the preferential loss of

low-mass stars. In addition, clusters experience shocks when the external tidal ﬁeld varies

rapidly. Passage through the Galactic disk and close to the Galactic bulge also accelerate

the destruction of clusters via gravitational shocks. Gnedin & Ostriker (1997) found that

tidal shocks contribute at least as much as two body relaxation to the destruction of the

current globular clusters. The escaped stars may remain in the vicinity of the cluster for

several Galactic orbits. As a result, the cluster is expected to have tidal tails.

Observational studies about tidal tails of globular clusters have been carried out only

recently because of diﬃculties in wide ﬁeld photometry. The signs of the existence of tidal

tails around globular clusters were found in many previous studies using radial density

proﬁles or two-dimensional density maps (Grillmair et al. 1995; Grillmair et al. 1996;

Holland, Fahlman, & Richer 1997; Lehmann & Scholz 1997; Leon, Bergond, & Vallenari

– 4 –

1999; Leon, Meylan, & Combes 2000; Testa et al. 2000; Odenkirchen et al. 2001; Sohn et

al. 2003; Lee et al. 2003; Odenkirchen et al. 2003). The studies from radial density proﬁles

suggest that many clusters have weak halo or tails of unbound stars which might result

from tidal stripping. However, two-dimensional density maps obtained in these studies did

not clearly conﬁrm this suggestion because these are too complex and diﬀuse to be regarded

as tidal tails.

More convincing evidences for the tidal tails came out of deep and wide CCD

observations. Recently, using wide ﬁeld photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

(SDSS), Odenkirchen et al. (2001, 2003) detected clear tidal tails around the Galactic

globular cluster Palomar 5, and showed that this cluster is being tidally disrupted. The

tails of Pal 5 extend over an arc of 10◦ on the sky, corresponding to a projected length of 4

kpc at the distance of the cluster. They also suggested that the Pal 5 would be destroyed

after the next disk crossing, which will happen in about 100 Myr. From the wide ﬁeld

photometry using CFH12K mosaic CCD, Lee et al. (2003) showed that the presence of

an extra-tidal proﬁle extending out to at least ∼ 30′ from the center of Galactic globular

cluster M92. Using CFH12K wide ﬁeld photometry, Sohn et al. (2003) found very weak

tidal halos around the remote young globular clusters Pal 3 and Pal 4.

In this paper we study the mass segregation eﬀect and spatial distribution of stars

around the Galactic globular cluster NGC 7492 using the CHF12K V R photometry data.

NGC 7492 is one of the most sparse globular clusters which is located far from the Galactic

center and plane (RGC = 24.9 kpc, Z = −23.1 kpc) and at 26.2 kpc from the sun. The

fundamental parameters of NGC 7492 are listed in Table 1. The ﬁrst CCD photometry for

this cluster was presented by Buonanno et al. (1987). They performed BV CCD photometry

for NGC 7492 down to V ∼ 23 roughly 2 mag fainter than the main-sequence turn-oﬀ. Cˆot´e,

Richer & Fahlman (1991, hearafter CRF91) carried out CCD photometry for this cluster

– 5 –

covering a ﬁeld of 2.′2 × 3.′5 containing cluster center. They presented a color-magnitude

diagram (CMD) for NGC 7492 that traces the main sequence to about one magnitude

fainter than that of Buonanno et al. (1987). They conﬁrmed the cluster metallicity to

be [Fe/H] = −1.51, and derived a distance modulus of (m − M)0 = 17.09 ± 0.20 mag

by comparing the ﬁducial isochrone of NGC 6752 given in VandenBerg, Bolte, & Stetson

(1990). They also reported the discovery of 27 blue straggler candidates which are found to

be more centrally concentrated than the cluster subgiants of similar brightness. If the blue

stragglers are more massive than the stars at the main sequence turnoﬀ, it would be the

result of cluster mass segregation. They also presented star counts for ten annuli centered

on the cluster core. However, they found no evidence for mass segregation in either the

surface density proﬁles or in the luminosity functions at diﬀerent radial positions. Possible

reasons of failure in ﬁnding mass segregation are that the stellar mass range sampled by

their data and/or the observed region is too small to ﬁnd the change of luminosity function

(LF) or mass function (MF). The small variation in the LF of NGC 7492 as a function of

radius also can be expected from the study by Pryor, Smith, & McClure (1986). Recently

Leon, Meylan, & Combes (2000) investigated the presence of tidal tails around 20 Galactic

globular clusters including NGC 7492. Except for a tiny extension pointing toward the

Galactic center, they did not ﬁnd any other signs of tidal tail in NGC 7492. In this study,

we present the investigation of mass segregation and tidal tails of NGC 7492 using deeper

and wider ﬁeld CCD photometry than that of CRF91.

In the following section, we present the observation and data reduction process. In

section 3, we show CMDs of NGC 7492 and describe CMD-mask algorithm which select

the sample of cluster member candidates. In section 4, we examine the mass segregation

eﬀect of the cluster using luminosity and mass functions of the cluster. In section 5, we

– 6 –

examine the spatial distribution of stars around the cluster using surface density map and

luminosity functions. Final results are summarized in section 6.

2. OBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION

The observations were made with the 3.6 m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)

during 1999 Oct. 17-18 using CFH12K, a 6 × 2 mosaic of 2048 × 4096 CCDs. The CFH12K

has an angular scale of 0.′′206/pixel at the f /4 prime focus of the CFHT, giving a ﬁeld of

view of 42′ × 28′. Each chip covers an area of 7′ × 14′. Two adjacent ﬁelds were observed

using V and R ﬁlters, covering an area of 42′ × 42′, which extends beyond 3 times larger

than the known tidal radius of this cluster, 8.′35 (Harris 1996). The positions of the

observed ﬁelds relative to the center of NGC 7492 are shown in Figure 1, and observational

information is given in Table 2. The points in Figure 1 represent the stars brighter than V

= 24 and the point size is proportional to the brightness of stars. Each ﬁeld was properly

dithered to ﬁll in the gaps between chips. We also obtained frames of ﬁelds containing

Landolt (1992) standard stars for photometric calibration. All of the science images were

obtained under good seeing conditions (FWHM of ∼ 0.′′8). Several twilight ﬂat-ﬁeld, bias

and dark frames were also taken.

EDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 1 HERE.

EDITOR: PLACE TABLE 2 HERE.

Pre-processing of the raw data, bias and dark subtraction and ﬂat ﬁelding, was done

using the FITS Large Images Processing Software (FLIPS), a very eﬃcient package for

the reduction of CCD mosaic images developed by Jean-Charles Cuillandre at CFHT

– 7 –

(Kalirai et al. 2001). FLIPS is designed to operate on individual chips within the CFH12K

mosaic. First, the good exposures for each of the bias and dark exposures were median

combined. For the ﬂat-ﬁeld images of each ﬁlter we averaged and sigma clipped the ﬂats

taken from observing run. Median combined bias and dark frames were then subtracted

from the ﬂat-ﬁeld and object images. After the object images were debiased, the images

were ﬂat-ﬁelded to account for pixel-to-pixel variations. FLIPS normalizes the background

sky values to the chip with the highest sky level (lowest gain) and provides for a scaled

data set with a smooth background on all chips. This makes the instrumental zero points

for each chip almost equal. The statistics at various positions in the mosaic show that the

ﬂat-ﬁelding to be typically better than 1% in both V and R ﬁlters.

Instrumental magnitudes of the point sources in the images were derived using the

programs DAOPHOT II/ALLSTAR (Stetson 1994). For long exposure data (600s) we

averaged the images of each ﬁlter using the ALIGN and IMCOMBRED commands within

FLIPS. Short exposure images were used to get the instrumental magnitudes for stars

saturated in long exposure images. The analysis is done separately for each chip because

the point-spread function (PSF) is diﬀerent for each of the 12 CCDs on the mosaic. We

used a variable PSF to account for small changes in the proﬁles of stars over the large

range of each CCD. We used the stellarity index of SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996)

for separating stars from background galaxies. As an example, in Figure 2 we show this

parameter for sources detected in F1. Those objects with a stellarity index greater than 0.8

were considered to be stars. We applied a little more strict cut to avoid overestimation of

faint stars which could exaggerate the mass segregation eﬀect and tidal extensions of the

cluster. This process also eliminates bad pixels caused by cosmic-ray hits. After further

cuts, based on the two DAOPHOT parameters, the magnitude error (< 0.2) and the PSF

ﬁtting parameter, χ2 (< 2), (we didn’t consider sharpness parameter because we already

used stellarity index) were made to eliminate spurious detections, the data sets in each ﬁlter

– 8 –

were matched and the positions, instrumental magnitudes, and colors were obtained for all

the stars.

EDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 2 HERE.

A number of Landolt (1992) standard stars in SA-92 were obtained during the

observing run in order to convert the instrumental magnitudes to standard photometric

magnitudes. The transformation equations to derive standard magnitudes are as follows;

V = v + αX + β(V − R) + Zv,

R = r + α′X + β′(V − R) + Zr.

In these equations v and r are instrumental magnitudes and α, α′ are the extinction

coeﬃcients of the airmass term X, β, β′ are the transformation coeﬃcient of the color term

(V − R), and Zv, Zr are the zero-point shift for the V and R bands. Since we could get only

1 ∼ 3 standard stars on each chip, we applied the standard values for the color term and

the atmospheric extinction coeﬃcient given on the CFHT home page. Separate calibrations

are actually required for each chip, because there are systematic diﬀerences between chips.

However, the color term does not signiﬁcantly change with diﬀerent exposures or nights of

observations and the extinction coeﬃcient is very stable at CFHT site (Kalirai et al. 2001).

We used standard stars to get the zero points of each chip which are the most critical part

of the transformation equations. The instrumental zero points for the chips were almost

identical because FLIPS normalizes the background sky value. The mean value of the

diﬀerences between our photometry of the Landolt (1992) standard stars and the standard

values is 0.01. To check the accuracy of photometry and calibration we used stars in the

dithered frames in each ﬁeld and overlapped region between the two ﬁelds. The same

stars in the diﬀerent chips and at diﬀerent locations in the ﬁeld of view of the instrument

– 9 –

showed diﬀerences less than limiting magnitude error (0.2) in all chips. Figure 3 shows the

magnitude diﬀerences between the same stars in the diﬀerent chips.

3. COLOR-MAGNITUDE DIAGRAM

The derived CMD based on the long and short exposure data for the entire observed

region of the cluster is shown in Figure 4. Well-deﬁned cluster sequence as well as ﬁeld stars

scattered over the entire CMD can be easily seen. In Figure 4, we can see a well-deﬁned

blue horizontal branch (BHB), and the absence of a red horizontal branch (RHB). Also

clearly visible are the red giant branch (RGB), subgiant branch (SGB), the main sequence

(MS) turnoﬀ at V ∼ 21 mag, and a MS that is extended down to about V ∼ 24.5 mag

which is roughly 3.5 mag fainter than turnoﬀ. The characteristics of CMD morphology are

described by CRF91 in detail. Since our main concern is the distribution of cluster stars,

the contamination from ﬁeld stars needs to be removed.

EDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 4 HERE.

To select cluster stars, we used the technique of the CMD-mask algorithm, which was

introduced by Grillmair et al. (1995). In this way we can diﬀerentiate cluster members

from the background and foreground ﬁeld stars by means of comparing stars inside the tidal

radius of the cluster with the ﬁeld stars in a distant part of the ﬁeld. The ﬁltering mask is

empirically chosen so as to optimize the ratio of cluster stars to ﬁeld stars in the relatively

sparsely populated outer region of the cluster.

– 10 –

We regarded the regions beyond 2.5 times of tidal radius (r > 20.′9) as background

regions which is shown in Figure 1. In Figure 5, we show CMDs of the cluster region inside

the tidal radius(r < rt = 8.′35), and outer region (r > 2.5 × rt = 20.′9). The procedure

was performed in the region −0.6 < V − R < 0.9 and 15 < V < 25.5 which is indicated by

rectangular boxes in Figure 5. The region was subdivided into a 30 × 55 array in which the

individual subgrid elements were 0.05 mag wide in V − R and 0.2 mag high in V .

EDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 5 HERE.

Assuming that the color-magnitude distribution of the ﬁeld stars is constant across the

observed ﬁeld, a color-magnitude sequence for the cluster can be estimated from (Grillmair

et al. 1995):

fcl(i, j) = ncl(i, j) − gnf (i, j),

where ncl(i, j) and nf (i, j) refer to the number of stars with color index i and magnitude

index j, counted in an area of circle with radius r < rt around the cluster center, and

around the background ﬁeld region, respectively. The factor g is the ratio of the area of

the cluster region to that of the background ﬁeld region. The signal-to-noise ratio of the

expected true number of cluster stars for each subarea was computed from:

s(i, j) =

fcl(i, j)
pncl(i, j) + g2nf (i, j)

.

From the signal-to-noise s we obtain a ﬁltering mask by isolating the region in the

color-magnitude subgrid with s > slim. To select the optimal range of color and magnitude,

the elements of s(i, j) were sorted into a gradually descending order over the one-dimensional

index l ﬁrst. From the subgrid element with the highest s value, cumulative star counts

were carried out in the cluster region using progressively larger areas of the CMD, ak = kal,

where al = 0.016mag2 is the area of a single element in the color-magnitude array. Then

– 11 –

the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio, S(ak), can be computed from:

S(ak) =

Ncl(ak) − gNf (ak)
pNcl(ak) + g2Nf (ak)

,

where Ncl(ak) and Nf (ak) are the cumulative number of stars in the corresponding subarea

in the cluster region and in the outer background ﬁeld region, respectively. Now, ncl(l) and

nf (l) refer to the number of stars within the cluster region and background ﬁeld region,

having ordered color-magnitude index l. This cumulative function reaches a maximum for

a particular subarea of the CMD plane. Based on the peak value of S, a threshold value of

slim is determined. The heavy lines in Figure 5 indicate the ﬁltering mask diﬀerentiating

cluster members from the ﬁeld stars. By extracting stars outside the ﬁltering mask in the

CMD, the ﬁeld contamination was reduced by a factor of ∼ 4.

4. MASS SEGREGATION

It is well known that the radial variation of luminosity functions (LFs) and mass

functions (MFs) give a crucial hint of the mass segregation eﬀect in a globular cluster. LFs

were constructed using all CMD-selected stars within the cluster’s tidal radius. To build

a reliable LF especially in the crowded ﬁeld, incompleteness corrections must be applied

correctly. To correct for the incompleteness of our photometry, we ran artiﬁcial star tests

on the V frames, using ADDSTAR routine in IRAF/DAOPHOT. First, we added artiﬁcial

stars in each 0.5 mag bin randomly on all original images. The number of added stars was

designed not to exceed 10% of the total number of stars that is actually present in that bin

so as not to enhance original crowding. The new frames obtained in this way were then

reduced in an identical manner used on the original frame. Figure 6 shows a sample of

the plots of the diﬀerences between input and output magnitudes for recovered artiﬁcial

stars selected by the same criteria applied to original image reduction. Since most of values

do not exceed 0.3 mag, the stars which have magnitude diﬀerences smaller than 0.3 mag

– 12 –

are considered as recovered stars. We repeated these procedures 10 times on each chip to

obtain meaningful statistics in each magnitude bin. Finally, the incompleteness correction

factor f is obtained by f = nrec/nadd, where nadd is the number of added stars and nrec is

the number of recovered stars. To examine the accuracy of the incompleteness correction,

we ran artiﬁcial star tests in another way. We selected two chips in each ﬁeld of V and R

frames. Then the artiﬁcial stars which have similar color band of the cluster MS and RGB

stars have been added on the V and R images with the same method described above. The

new frames were then reduced in an identical manner used on the original frame. The stars,

which have magnitude diﬀerences smaller than 0.3 mag and color diﬀerences smaller than

0.2 mag are considered as recovered stars. The incompleteness correction factors obtained

from this way were in accord with the previous results within 5% on the same chips. The

incompleteness correction factors depended on the distance from the cluster center and did

not show any diﬀerences between chips. The resulting incompleteness correction factors

were then applied to the raw LFs. To investigate any spatial variation of LF, the LFs for

the inner region (0′ < r < 1.′3) and the outer region (1.′3 < r < 8.′35) are constructed

separately. The regions are divided to contain similar number of stars in each region. The

corrected number of stars in each magnitude bin and the incompleteness factors are given

in Table 3, and the corrected LFs are plotted in Figure 7. The histogram in Figure 7 is the

LF for all selected stars within tidal radius (r < 8.′35). The solid line overlaid on the inner

LF is that of NGC 7492 for 0′ < r < 2′ derived by CRF91, which agrees very well with ours.

This agreement implies that the incompleteness corrections are properly applied.

– 13 –

The presence of mass segregation be seen from the radial variation of LFs. The slope

of LFs of globular clusters are known to increase toward the outer parts of the cluster

where low mass stars preferentially occupy as a result of mass segregation. However, we

could not ﬁnd any deﬁnite evidence from Figure 7 alone. As discussed below, the small

variation in the LF of NGC 7492 as a function of radius is not an unexpected result. The

LFs were converted into mass functions (MFs) using the mass-luminosity relation of Baraﬀe

et al. (1997) and a distance modulus of (m − M)0 = 17.09 (CRF91). The calculated MFs

are shown in Figure 8. Due to the small number of stars brighter than the MS turn-oﬀ,

only stars with V > 20 mag have been used. Filled circles represent the MF for the inner

region (0′ < r < 1.′3) while open circles for outer region (1.′3 < r < 8.′35). Open triangles

represent the MF derived by CRF91. Because of our LF extends only to MV ∼ 7.5 the MF

is deﬁned only in the range 0.6 ∼ 0.8M⊙. For this reason, it is diﬃcult to say anything

deﬁnitely about the slope of the main sequence MF based solely on Figure 8. CRF91

derived a slope of the MF x = −1.1 ± 0.5 using the theoretical LF from Drukier et al.

(1988). Here x represents the slope of a MF of the form

Φ(M)dM ∝ M −(1+x)dM.

We insert lines in Figure 8 which show several power law indices covering the slope from

CRF91. Although it is diﬃcult to ﬁt a single power law to MFs of this cluster, we can

conclude that the x value lies within the range from previous study. It is noteworthy that

the cluster has a very ﬂat MF and the variation of the MFs from inner to outer regions is

very small. Although the slope changes by very small amount, we can see a clear tendency

of increase in the slope of MF from inner to outer regions in Figure 8. It could be a sign of

mass segregation in this cluster.

EDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 7 HERE.

– 14 –

EDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 8 HERE.

Small change in the MF slope does not mean that this cluster is not fully relaxed.

Pryor, Smith & McClure (1986) have investigated the eﬀects of mass segregation on main

sequence MFs for globular clusters with various central concentrations. They found that

mass segregation depends on core concentration parameter (c) and the slope of mass

functions (x). They showed that the mass segregation eﬀect appears more clearly in

models with large concentrations and steep (larger x) mass functions. For a fully relaxed

cluster having c = 1.0 and x ∼ −1, there will be very little change in the MFs due to

mass segregation. Using the HST photometry, Grillmair & Smith (2001) investigated the

main-sequence LF of Pal 5. According to their results, Pal 5 has a very ﬂat MF (x = −0.5)

and shows very little evidence for mass diﬀerentiation between the core of the cluster and

the half-mass radius. They suggested that Pal 5 has lost a large fraction of its original

stellar content as a result of tidal shocking. As mentioned in section 1, Pal 5 appears to

be in the ﬁnal phase of tidal disruption (Odenkirchen et al. 2003). In any globular cluster

the form of the present day mass function depends on the initial mass function and the

process of dynamical evolution of the cluster. McClure et al. (1986) suggested that the

slope of MF is related with metallicity of cluster. They proposed that the observed strong

dependence of MF slopes on metallicity reﬂects, at least in part, properties of the initial

mass functions with which the clusters formed. Later, Djorgovski, Piotto, & Capaccioli

(1993) demonstrated that the MF slopes are determined not only by the metallicity but

also by the location in the Galaxy. They showed that the clusters closer to the Galactic

center have ﬂatter MFs. At a given Galactocentric distance (RGC), clusters with a smaller

distance from the Galactic plane (Z) have ﬂatter MFs, and at a given position, clusters

with lower metallicity have steeper MFs. From N-body simulations, Capaccioli, Piotto, &

Stiavelli (1993) interpreted the dependence on position as the eﬀect of tidal shocks. Disk

– 15 –

and bulge shocking acts preferentially on stars located in the outer region of the cluster

and leads to a loss of low mass stars. As a result the clusters near the Galactic center and

plane, tend to have ﬂatter MFs. Since NGC 7492 has intermediate metallicity ([Fe/H] =

−1.51) among the Galactic globular clusters and large distant from Galactic center and

plane (RGC = 24.9 kpc; Z = −23.1 kpc), ﬂat MF of NGC 7492 can not be interpreted

neither by its metallicity nor by Galactic position. However, dynamical evolution of a

globular cluster can not be determined only by present position but also by cluster’s orbit.

Piotto, Cool, & King (1997) presented a comparison of deep HST LFs of four Galactic

globular clusters. They showed that three of four clusters (M15, M30, and M92) have

nearly identical LFs, whereas NGC 6397 has a distinctly diﬀerent LF, especially in the

fainter part. They suggested that the three globular clusters which have similar LFs were

formed with similar MFs and suﬀered very little changes (or experienced similar changes

regardless of the location), and that the deﬁciency of low-mass stars in NGC 6397 was due

to tidal shocks, stellar evaporation through internal relaxation, or a combination of the two.

Relatively ﬂat MF of NGC 6397 could be explained by its orbit given by Dauphle et al.

(1996) which is very vulnerable to tidal shocks. Later, comparing MF slopes for 7 Galactic

globular clusters Piotto & Zoccali (1999) suggested that the ﬂattening of MF slopes might

be related to the cluster’s dynamical evolution. From the N-body simulations, Baumgardt

& Makino (2003) predicted that the slope of MFs of the clusters should decrease constantly

as the clusters evolve, and there is a good correlation between the slopes and the cluster

lifetimes. If the ﬂat MF of NGC 7492 is not primordial it might be a result of dynamical

evolution of this cluster. When the Galactic orbit of NGC 7492 is determined the inﬂuence

of Galactic tidal shocks on this cluster could be known.

5. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF STARS

5.1. Surface Density Map

In order to characterize the distribution of stars around the cluster, we constructed

surface number density map. The sample of cluster member candidates obtained by

CMD-mask process in the previous section was used to construct surface density map.

Initially, the candidate cluster stars in the surveyed region were binned on a grid of

0.′2 × 0.′2. Unfortunately, our surveyed region is not wide enough to get proper background

maps. However, we used ﬁeld stars having color greater than 0.9 to check the gradient of

distribution of ﬁeld stars and possible photometric biases in the entire surveyed region.

After constructing the map of ﬁeld stars by binning 1′ × 1′, we smoothed it to get a surface

map dominated only by the smooth gradient of ﬁeld stars. We subtracted this ﬁeld star

map from the CMD-selected one. We then convolved the map with a Gaussian kernel of

width 1.′0. The resulting smoothed surface density map is shown in Figure 9.

EDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 9 HERE.

We overlaid contour levels and marked the tidal radius with a thick circle. The arrow

indicates the direction to the galactic center. We can see a marginal extension toward the

Galactic anticenter (northeast) in Figure 9. Also there seems to be a small extension to the

northwest from the cluster center. Many N-body simulations of globular cluster tidal tails

show that the stars evaporated from the cluster form a twisted, two-sided lobe distribution

of cluster member stars (Combes, Leon, & Meylan 1999; Yim & Lee 2002; Lee et al. 2004).

However, the shape of such lobes depends on the orientation of the cluster’s orbit to our

line of sight. Combes, Leon, & Meylan (1999) showed that the lobes can be asymmetric and

even seen one-sided according to the cluster’s orbits and projection eﬀects in their Figure 13

and Figure 15. The extensions shown in Figure 9 can not be regarded as a real feature

solely based on the surface density map. We will check the signiﬁcance of the extensions

using luminosity functions in the following subsection.

From Figure 9, we can see that the cluster NGC 7492 has very ﬂattend shape. White &

Shawl (1987) have measured the projected axial ratio (b/a) of 100 Galactic globular clusters,

where a and b denote semi-major and semi-minor radii, respectively. They obtained the

value of < b/a >= 0.76 from NGC 7492 while mean axial ratio was < b/a >= 0.93 ± 0.01.

We used ELLIPSE task in IRAF/STSDAS to ﬁt the elliptical shape of the cluster. Figure 10

shows the axial ratio of the cluster as a function of the semi-major axes of the ellipses. The

axial ratio decreased and reached to a value of 0.77. White & Shawl (1987) argued that

the ﬂattened shape of the globular clusters can be caused by either anisotropy in velocity

dispersion or rotation. The tidally truncated clusters tends to become quickly isotropic

(Takahashi & Lee 2000), the ﬂattening is likely due to rotation (Combes, Leon & Meylan

1999). Kinematical data also showed that the ﬂattening could be explained by rotation,

and that the minor axes are nearly coincident with the rotation axes (Meylan & Mayor

1986). The initial angular momentum of a cluster is expected to disappear with time by

the escape of stars carrying some angular momentum. Kim et al. (2002) showed using the

Fokker-Plank method that the initial rotation decreases with time after core-collapse and

ﬁnally disappear. As a result, the ﬂattening of a globular cluster could be related with its

dynamical age. From a compilation of data on globular cluster ﬂattenings in our Galaxy

and M31, Davoust & Prugniel (1990) showed that globular clusters with shorter relaxation

times tend to be rounder. They suggested a scenario which globular clusters are initially

ﬂattened and become rounder as they lose stars and angular momentum. According to this

scenario, NGC 7492 would be the one which has the youngest dynamical age among the

Galactic globular clusters. However considering the ﬂat MF of NGC 7492, it is unlikely

that this cluster maintain initial dynamical status. If the ﬂattening of NGC 7492 cannot

be explained only by initial rotation of this cluster, we should consider some alternative

– 18 –

sources of globular cluster rotation. One possible alternative is tidal interaction with the

Galaxy. From N-body simulations Lee et al. (2004) showed that the globular clusters gain

angular momentum from tidal interactions with host galaxy. If a cluster rotates by the

tidal interaction with the galaxy, the orientation of the rotation axis would be the same as

its revolution axis. When we get the orbit of NGC 7492, the inﬂuence of tidal interaction

on its rotation could be examined.

5.2. Luminosity Functions

Figure 9 shows marginal extensions of stellar distributions around NGC 7492 toward

northeast and northwest from the cluster center. However we can not regard the extensions

shown in Figure 9 as a real feature using only the surface density map. We therefore

analyzed the LFs of the stars around the clusters to check the signiﬁcance of the extensions.

In ﬁgure 11, we show the cumulative LF for stars (solid line) located in outer northern

part (r > rt) where extensions appear. The dashed line indicates the LF for stars within the

tidal radius (rt) of NGC 7492. For comparison, we also show the LF for stars in southern

part of the cluster as a dotted line. These LFs are constructed using CMD-selected stars.

Incompleteness corrections are properly applied to each LF as described in the previous

section. The LFs are normalized by the total number of stars for each selected group. A

Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test of the LFs for stars in the outer northern part (solid line)

compared to that for stars within the tidal radius (dashed line) gives a signiﬁcance level

of 75% probability that both cumulative LFs follow the same distribution. On the other

hand, the K-S signiﬁcance level of cumulative LF for stars in the southern part (dotted

line) is less than 1%. Since mass segregation eﬀect of this cluster is very small, we can

– 19 –

expect that the LF for stars in the tidal tails of the cluster would be almost the same with

that for stars within the tidal radius in the limit of our analysis (Grillmair & Smith 2001).

Odenkirchen (2003) also showed that the LF for the stars in the tidal tails of Pal 5 is in

very good agreement with the LF in the cluster. Theses indicate that the extensions shown

in the surface density map (Figure 9) could be a real feature.

6. SUMMARY

We have carried out a wide ﬁeld CCD photometry of NGC 7492 and investigated the

dynamical structure of the cluster. The observations with the CFH12K mosaic CCD cover

the area of 42′ × 42′, about 3 times larger than the known tidal radius of this cluster. We

used the technique of the CMD-mask algorithm to select cluster member star candidates,

and we have used these stars to examine the characteristics of the spatial distribution of

stars around the clusters. The mass segregation eﬀect and stellar distribution around the

cluster have been investigated by means of a completeness-corrected LFs and MFs and the

surface density map.

The slope of cluster main sequence MF slightly increases toward the outer part of the

cluster, as expected from mass segregation. It could be a veriﬁcation of mass segregation

eﬀect of this cluster which was suggested doubtfully only from the distribution of blue

stragglers by CRF91. Although the change in the MF slope is very small it does not mean

that this cluster is not fully relaxed. The relatively ﬂat MF slope of NGC 7492 and its

small mass might be a result of dynamical evolution of this cluster.

Surface density map shows possible extensions of spatial stellar distributions beyond

– 20 –

the tidal radius of NGC 7492. The extensions of the tails of NGC 7492 are oriented toward

the Galactic anticenter (northeast) and northwest from the cluster center. A comparison

of LF for stars in the tails with that for stars within the tidal radius suggests that the

extensions shown in the surface density map could be a real feature. Surface density map

also shows that the NGC 7492 has very ﬂat shape. The axial ratio (b/a) of this cluster

decrease with semi-major axis and reached to a value of 0.77 which is one of the smallest

values the Galactic globular clusters have. If the ﬂattened shape of this cluster is caused by

its rotation, it might have been much aﬀected by Galactic tidal ﬁeld.

Pryor et al. (1991) argued that low concentration (low-c) clusters lost much of their

original stellar mass over extended periods of time through the evaporation and stripping

of stars. Recently, Odenkirchen et al. (2003) showed clear evidences that the low-mass,

low-c Galactic halo cluster Pal 5 is being tidally disrupted. In addition to previous studies,

ﬂat mass function, tidal extensions, and ﬂat shape of the cluster which are investigated in

this study suggest that NGC 7492 might have experienced a lot of dynamical processes

through tidal interaction with the Galaxy. However, kinematic data of NGC 7492 are

not obtained yet. The information on the orbits of individual halo clusters can produce

powerful constraints on the Galactic potential. We need spectroscopic observations and

proper motion studies about NGC 7492 to get the information about the rotation and the

Galactic orbit of the cluster. We also encourage deeper and wider CCD photometry of this

cluster to ﬁnd possible tidal tails extending over the coverage of this study.
