We investigate opportunities and challenges of running virtual reality (VR) studies remotely. Today, many
consumers own head-mounted displays (HMDs), allowing them to participate in scientific studies from their
homes using their own equipment. Researchers can benefit from this approach by being able to reach a more
diverse study population and to conduct research at times when it is difficult to get people into the lab (cf. the
COVID pandemic). We first conducted an online survey (N=227), assessing HMD owners’ demographics, their
VR setups and their attitudes towards remote participation. We then identified different approaches to running
remote studies and conducted two case studies for an in-depth understanding. We synthesize our findings
into a framework for remote VR studies, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches,
and derive best practices. Our work is valuable for HCI researchers conducting VR studies outside labs.

1 INTRODUCTION
Virtual Reality (VR) has become a widely adopted technology in the Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) research community and beyond [43]. Many subtopics emerged around this technology,
including but not limited to, novel interaction techniques, presence and immersion, avatar modeling,
navigation, and locomotion. More recently, researchers started looking into how VR can substitute
or complement other research approaches [29, 40], for example, in-the-wild studies that require a
lot of effort to maintain the technology used, evaluations in potentially dangerous environments
(e.g., automotive or pedestrian user interfaces), or the investigation of situations that occur rarely.
In the past decades, VR headsets were not widely available and their setup required a substantial
degree of technical knowledge. Hence, the vast majority of research was conducted in lab settings,
where researchers took care of the setup and guided participants through (controlled) studies. As a
result, participants of such studies were often part of a rather homogeneous university population
– a well-known challenge in HCI research [7].

The past years witnessed a proliferation of VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) in the consumer
market1 and while the number of worldwide shipped VR units with 6 million units in 20192 is
still marginal from a commercial perspective, a considerable number of end users now own a VR
headset. This creates an unprecedented chance for researchers to move VR research out of the lab
and reach a more diverse community – similar to what happened with other technologies that
reached the consumer market, such as smartphones [20–22] or public displays [14].

In this work, we contribute an in-depth investigation of an emerging research paradigm, that
is conducting out-of-the-lab research with owners of VR headsets. In particular, we explore the
challenges and pitfalls researchers are facing as they are shifting or complementing their research
using this new paradigm and synthesize them into a framework for use by other researchers. To
this end, our work is guided by the following research questions:

• RQ1: How suitable are HMD owners and their VR setups as subjects for remote studies, and

what limitations do home setups have?
– 1.1: What are the demographics of HMD owners?
– 1.2: Which VR equipment do they own?
– 1.3: What are their home VR setups like?
– 1.4: How do they feel about participating in remote studies from home?

• RQ2: What suitable approaches exist for conducting remote VR studies, and what are their

advantages and disadvantages?
– 2.1: What options exist for developing and setting up VR research applications?
– 2.2: How can VR research prototypes be distributed to study participants?
– 2.3: Through which channels can owners of VR headsets be reached and recruited?
– 2.4: What special considerations are there when designing and running a remote study?
Our research approach is as follows: we set out with conducting an online survey (N=227)
among owners of VR headsets to understand their demographics, the equipment they own, the
setting in which they use it, and whether they would be willing to participate in remote VR studies.
Subsequently, based on a review of existing VR distribution channels, we describe different ways in
which VR applications for remote studies can be implemented and distributed as well as how data
collection can be realized. We then report on our experiences from two remote case studies, where
we experimented with different approaches. We then synthesize all our findings into a framework
that guides researchers through different ways of designing and conducting remote VR studies.

Remote VR Studies

Our framework consists of four primary approaches to remote studies:

(1) Researchers build a standalone VR application that is distributed directly to participants.
(2) Researchers build a VR application that is distributed through existing vendor platforms

("app stores") such as Steam and the Play Store.

(3) Researchers build a VR application using an API of an existing social VR platform (e.g., Rec

Room, VRChat) and upload it to the corresponding platform.

(4) Researchers set up their study environment directly within an existing social VR platform

using the tools provided by these platforms.

All of these approaches come with unique advantages, drawbacks, and considerations. Some of
the clearest differences are in the level of autonomy and the amount of required effort. Using existing
vendor platforms and social VR platforms requires that researchers conform to the regulations and
limitations of these platforms. This often means that options for data collection are limited, and the
platforms may also be more limited in their functionalities. However, using such platforms can often
make setting up the study far easier and faster, and existing platforms ensure an existing user base,
and often alleviate compatibility issues. Building custom software and distributing it independently
may get around many of the limitations with existing platforms, but the workload is often higher
and may result in other challenges (e.g., ensuring the safety and privacy of participants).

Another dimension is whether or not the VR study is conducted with a remote study experimenter,
or whether participants run the study independently, i.e., without remote guidance. We discuss
how well the four main approaches lend themselves to guided studies and independent studies.

Our research is valuable for researchers considering to conduct virtual reality studies remotely.
Beyond an opportunity to reach a larger and more diverse audience, our research is also of value
for other reasons. Most prominently, the recent COVID-19 pandemic affected the HCI community
around the globe, making it difficult for many researchers to recruit participants for their work
in the lab. This unprecedented event raised the question: "How can VR researchers continue to
conduct studies?" Here, we believe that our work can provide useful guidance. Our findings are not
only valuable in a pandemic but also opens up opportunities beyond these times.
Contribution Statement. We contribute a holistic view on remote VR studies. Specifically, (1) we
present the results of an online survey assessing users’ view towards such studies and their VR
settings; (2) we provide a review of research approaches with a focus on how they influence the
development / study setup, software distribution, and recruitment challenges; (3) we report on two
studies and derive lessons learned; and (4) we synthesize our findings into a framework.

2 BACKGROUND
Several strands of prior work are relevant to our research. After briefly introducing the term remote
VR studies, we review (a) work involving ubiquitous technologies for conducting out-of-the-lab
research as well as (b) prior work on conducting VR studies outside the lab.

2.1 Terminology
Over many decades, the HCI research community adapted or came up with new approaches to
research, which can be broadly classified into research conducted in controlled settings (i.e. in the
lab) vs. in less controlled settings (i.e. in the field). As Virtual Reality is being appropriated as a tool
for conducting research, another dimension – in addition to where the study physically takes place
– emerges, that is the virtual setting. Here, researchers are provided rich opportunities to situate
their research in almost any setting they like – be it the reconstruction of a lab, a public space, a
replica of a person’s home, or an entire world (cf. Second Life3).

Rivu et al.

We focus on studies taking place physically in users’ homes but not being restricted with regard

to the virtual setting. In the following, we refer to these type of studies as remote VR studies.

2.2 Leveraging Consumer Devices for Out-of-the-Lab Research
The idea of leveraging consumers’ devices for ’bringing the lab to participants’ is already established
practice in several areas of human-computer interaction research. Among the most prominent
examples is work by Henze et al. who used smart phones as a tool to conduct out-of-the-lab studies,
initially on touch targeting and typing behavior [20–22]. Over the following years, the community
saw more studies focusing on various aspects, including but not limited to an exploration of user
interaction with notifications [34], authentication behavior [4, 10, 35], and keystroke dynamics [9].
Prior work has identified both strength and challenges of such types of studies. Of particular
interest is the work of Gustarini et al. [19] who categorize challenges into the design, development,
execution, and data analysis phase. While their work is specific to studies focusing on smart
phones, several of the challenges apply to other technologies as well and, hence, informed our work.
These challenges include the question of which data can be collected, where data can be stored,
how researchers can deal with device heterogeneity, recruiting bias, remunerating participants,
participant cheating, handling participants’ questions, considering participants’ motivation and
privacy needs, conducting interviews and how to synchronize data.

Studies have also been conducted to understand the extent of ecological validity in remote
experiments. For example, Andreasen et al. [5] conducted an empirical comparison of remote
usability testing and conventional lab testing, and Germine et al. [18] investigated data quality across
lab-based and web-based experiments. Research shows that it is possible to achieve ecologically
valid results using out-of-lab studies [5, 18].

2.3 Virtual Reality Out-of-the-Lab Studies
In the following section we summarize key insights obtained from prior research. We take a
chronological view on how out-of-the-lab studies have progressed over the years.

In 2012, Hodgson el at. presented ways for ‘portable’ VR studies, using systems that can be easily
carried and used in-the-wild [25]. The authors introduced a self-contained backpack, capable of
running VR simulations and demonstrated how such portable systems can be used by researchers.
Four years later, Steed et al. [39] experimented on presence and embodiment in VR through
remote studies by recruiting Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard owners. They argue that
for remote VR studies it is generally easier to recruit more participants than for typical lab-based
studies. However, their work suggests that the diversity of participants was still defined by the
nature of the study. The authors also highlighted that remote studies might require more effort
than lab studies in terms of, for example, preparation and app development.

In 2017, Mottelson et al. [31] conducted experiments both in and out of the lab to understand the
advantages and pitfalls between the two approaches. The experiments generally yielded comparable
results as both in-lab and remote studies were able to collect reliable data and similar output. At
the same time, out-of-the-lab experiments were characterized by a greater heterogeneity among
participants such as sample population. They also outline several limitations of remote studies
including demographics validity, ethical concerns, and the lack of experiment control.

Ma et al. [28] conducted three behavioral experiments in VR using crowd sourcing in 2018.
Their evaluation suggests the feasibility of conducting web-based VR experiments albeit several
challenges, including few participants with access to VR-capable devices. The authors also highlight
many advantages, including obtaining a more diverse sample compared to lab VR studies. In a
study about social interactions in weekly VR get-togethers, Moustafa and Steed [32] in the same
year also highlighted the potential of reaching broad and diverse audiences through remote studies.

Recently, Saffo et al. investigated the feasibility of running VR studies via a popular social
platform, VRChat [33]. They identified the ability to enable researchers to create their own content,
the large user base, and the ease of recruiting participants from within VRChat as advantages of
the platform as it is easier to recruit participants within the platform. At the same time, Saffo et
al. reported on data collection to be limited when using online platforms as each online platform
reviews the content before researchers are able to upload content.

Huber and Gajos [26] worked on conducting online VR studies with uncompensated and un-
supervised participants. While they identified advantages, such as recruiting participants from
all over the world with various backgrounds, there are challenges: for example, in this study the
sample count was much smaller compared to other online studies.

2.4 Summary
Our review shows that while researchers have recognized and acknowledged the potential of remote
VR studies, for many years they have struggled with challenges, such as the available technology,
the number of people who had access to the technology, means to reach out to them, and ways of
delivering software to the participants. Not only with the current pandemic, we see that interest
in this type of studies is increasing at a rapidly accelerating pace. We believe to be currently at a
turning point where with advances in technology and due to the increasing proliferation of the
technology for the first time it is finally possible for VR researchers to strongly benefit from this
approach. Yet there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of how such studies can be
implemented. This is at the focus of our work.

While much can be learned from other sub fields of HCI where technology that became widely
available to end users was leveraged for conducting remote studies, there are many aspects unique
to virtual reality and head-mounted displays that remain under-explored, including but not limited
to the available technology, the environment, data collection methods, and distribution channels.
Some of the aforementioned aspects have been touched upon in prior work. Yet, our analysis
shows that pre-requisites have changed over the years and new opportunities and challenges
have emerged. Our work provides an understanding of the current state-of-the-art in running
remote VR studies as well as a comprehensive assessment of this study paradigm that we synthesize
into a framework. The framework explains different approaches to remote VR studies and also
summarizes best practices and lessons learned.

3 UNDERSTANDING VR USERS THROUGH AN ONLINE SURVEY
We conducted an online survey among VR users with the goal of better understanding (a) their
demographics, (b) how they can be reached and recruited, (c) what their VR setups look like, (d)
which technology they own, and (e) whether they are willing to participate in remote VR studies.

3.1 Survey Content and Questions
In particular, our survey focuses on the following aspects:

Demographics We assessed the participants’ age, gender, background, and their reasons for

owning a VR device.

VR Equipment & Platforms We asked about the devices they own and the platforms they

are using.

VR Setting and Use We asked them to describe their VR setup, the space (with an option to
upload a picture of the space), how often they use it, and how likely they are to be interrupted
while being in VR.

Rivu et al.

Willingness to participate We asked the participants how willing they are to participate in
remote VR studies, both in general as well as in situations such as the COVID-19 lockdown,
and what kind of payment they might expect.

3.2 Recruiting
We distributed the survey via different channels, in particular such that would also be used by
researchers to reach out to potential participants of a VR study. To this end, we included research-
oriented crowd sourcing platforms, VR online forums, social media and university mailing lists. In
the following we report some lessons learned.

3.2.1 Research-oriented Crowd Sourcing Platforms. We recruited through two platforms: Prolific4
and XRDRN5. Prolific is a platform primarily meant for recruiting study participants, for example,
for surveys. It allows participants to be pre-selected by demographics (for example, owners of VR
devices). XRDRN is a dedicated platform to connect researchers and participants with a specific
focus on mixed reality. The platform was built specifically in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Response rates from Prolific were considerably higher and faster. This was likely because (a) Prolific
integrates means for payment directly with the platform whereas for XRDRN this would be handled
out of the platform between researchers and participants, and (b) XRDRN is still in the early stages
of building a community. Another aspect is that since all participants on Prolific are paid, many of
them can be expected to be ‘professional’ study takers.

Forums & Social Media. We reached out to VR users through Facebook, Reddit and platform-
3.2.2
specific forums (e.g., Steam, Rec Room). Within these platforms, we identified suitable subgroups
(e.g., VR-related subreddits in Reddit).

Within platforms, subgroups could be easily identified. However, it took some time to ensure that
we complied with the rules of each subgroup and that posting an invitation to an online survey was
appropriate. Where groups did not specifically allow or disallow for these kinds of posts, we reached
out to moderators to seek permission. While for some groups we obtained permission in this way,
many moderators were unsure and suggested we rather post in other channels, for example, such
that were concerned with the organization of VR events or for discussing miscellaneous topics. We
noticed that such groups often had fewer active members, which limited the visibility of the survey.
Some subgroups employed specific posting procedures. Some required specific tags or features
to be assigned to messages (for example, on Reddit or Rec Room) – yet the pre-defined tags were
often a poor match for our recruitment messages. Many forums also make it mandatory for users to
achieve a certain number of points (points are acquired based on several metrics such as number of
comments and posts on other discussion threads) before they are eligible to create their own threads,
while others required a user account to be at least two months old before being eligible to post.
When posting links to different subforums simultaneously, there is a chance that auto-moderators
flag the posts as spam. Established VR products (such as Unity and Rec Room) run forums and
groups on different social platforms (such as Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Discord). Those could be
used in addition to more general groups on VR.

3.2.3 University Mailing Lists. This method helped to reach out to a large number of recipients.
In particular, we used mailing lists allowing a general university population to be reached. This
population included many non-technical subjects. Our experience shows that only few of them
were eligible for the survey (as they were required to own an HMD to participate). Mailing lists
targeting students from computer science subjects might reach more participants.

3.3 Results
We received 227 complete surveys (out of 276). Respondents were recruited through Prolific (97),
Reddit (95), mailing lists (14), Facebook (12), Discord (4), VR platforms (3) and other (2).

3.3.1 Demographics. A total of 227 participants responded to our online survey, 52 female (cf.
Table 1 for an overview) Participants were between 18 and 56 years of age (𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛 = 29.72, 𝑆𝐷 = 8.8).
They mainly lived in the US (𝑁 = 66), the UK (𝑁 = 54), and Germany (𝑁 = 24).

Most of the respondents identified as consumers of VR products (𝑁 = 214, 94%), and some were
VR developers (𝑁 = 21, 9%), VR content creators (𝑁 = 20, 9%), and VR researchers (𝑁 = 16, 7%).
They mainly used their VR setup for gaming (𝑁 = 206, 91%), but also for other purposes like
socialising, development and research, and during work.

We furthermore asked the participants if they had discovered new uses for their VR setup during
the COVID-19 pandemic. More than half (𝑁 = 130, 57%) reported that they had discovered new VR
games to play, and some had discovered new VR platforms (𝑁 = 35, 15%). Some users had started
using their setups for entirely new purposes, like meeting with friends and relatives (𝑁 = 24, 11%),
watching movies socially (𝑁 = 23, 10%), and collaborating with colleagues (𝑁 = 12, 5%).

3.3.2 Understanding Users’ VR Settings. We first asked participants about the devices they owned.
Most participants used Oculus devices (𝑁 = 79), followed by Valve Index (𝑁 = 59), PlayStation VR
(𝑁 = 41), and HTC Vive (𝑁 = 23).

Most participants were the sole users of their VR setup (𝑁 = 153, 67%). Their setups were placed
in rooms rarely used by others (𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 = 2, 1=not at all, 5=almost all the time). Consequently, most
participants could use their VR setups without any notable constraints (𝑁 = 198), as opposed to, for
example, not being able to access the VR setup due to someone else using the room. Most participants
also evaluated that the chances of being interrupted during VR use were low (𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 = 2, 1=very
unlikely, 5=very likely). Furthermore, participants reported that getting their VR setup ready for
use (Figure 2c) did not require much effort (𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 = 2, 1=no effort at all, 5=a lot of effort).

(a) Total time (hours) spent in VR on weekdays and
weekends. Most users spend at most two hours with
the VR setup on weekdays and on weekends under
normal circumstances. During the pandemic, partici-
pants reported somewhat higher usage.

(b) Space available for users’ VR setups, showing
most users have a space of up to 25 square meters.
26 participants stated a larger than 40 square meters
space (excluded in this plot).

Fig. 1. Results on how much time participants spend in VR and how large their VR setups are.

Regarding usage times (Figure 1a), most participants reported to normally use their setups for up
to two hours on weekdays (in total during an average week) (𝑁 = 129) as well as up to two hours
on weekends (𝑁 = 140) (in total during an average weekend). During the pandemic, participants
reported spending overall more time with their VR setup.

We asked participants to additionally give an estimate of their VR setup’s size, providing the
width and length in meters (Figure 1b). 65 participants (29%) reported having up to 5 𝑚2, 71 (31%)
from 5 to 10 𝑚2, 26 (11%) from 10 to 15 𝑚2, 21 (9%) from 15 to 20 𝑚2, and 15 (7%) from 20 to 25 𝑚2.

3.3.3 Participation in VR Studies. We inquired about participants’ willingness to participate in
VR studies (‘I am willing to participate in VR studies.’; 5-Point Likert scale; 1=strongly disagree,
5=strongly agree). To better understand whether this was a result of the current pandemic situation,
we asked the question for both during and after the lockdown (Figure 2a). 152 participants (67%)
agreed or strongly agreed to be willing to participate in VR studies after the pandemic (𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 = 4),
while 165 participants (73%) agreed or strongly agreed during the pandemic (𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 = 4).

We also looked into how comfortable participants felt about participating in VR studies in different
study locations (Figure 2b). Participants felt more comfortable about the idea of participating from
home than attending a lab study (home: 𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 = 5, lab: 𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 = 3).

Regarding compensation (multiple choices), participants were mostly willing to accept cash
(𝑁 = 189, 83%), but also game vouchers (𝑁 = 103, 45%). A total of 77 participants (34%) stated that
they would do so voluntarily without any compensation.

3.4 Summary and Discussion
Our survey provided insights on the current mainstream users of VR. First, the survey confirms
the ‘cliche’ of VR users being primarily gamers (91%). Furthermore, users were predominantly
male (77%) and mostly consumers (94%). Besides gaming, a rather prominent use case for VR was
socializing, with 28% of participants stating they use social platforms and 19% that they use VR to
meet with friends and family. We also found that participants used many different VR devices and
platforms. The most popular VR platforms were VRChat (40%) and Rec Room (25%) followed by
AltspaceVR (11%) and Mozilla Hubs (10%), indicating that there is a wide range of platforms with
potential for researchers to conduct studies. Many participants used more than one platform.

(a) Willingness to participate in studies

(b) Comfort in participating in studies

Fig. 2. Results on how willing participants are to participate in remote studies, how comfortable they feel
about it, and how much effort it is for them to use their VR setups.

(c) Required effort for VR setup

Most HMD owners used their VR setups exclusively without notable constraints. Participants
reported that the effort required to get their setup ready for use was low, suggesting that VR
setups are typically permanent setups with a dedicated space. Respondents also estimated that the
likelihood of being interrupted during VR use was low, again suggesting that the setups are mainly
used in personal spaces (e.g., bedrooms) rather than in shared spaces (e.g., living rooms). These
findings indicate that home VR setups are generally well suited for remote studies.

Furthermore, we assessed the size of the users’ VR setups. The majority of participants (60%)
seemed to operate withing a space of up to 10 𝑚2. Around half of this group (29% of all respondents)
reported having a small space of up to 5 𝑚2, likely indicating a seated setup. These findings suggest
that remote studies requiring active movement in a larger space (e.g., more than 15 𝑚2) might be
challenging as many HMD owners do not have the necessary space, potentially risking skewed
research results as well as participants getting injured. To work around the problem of small spaces,
researchers might consider various locomotion techniques, such as teleportation techniques [8, 17],
to reduce the need for physical movement. However, such techniques might not always be desirable,
particularly if "real" physical movement is critical to the phenomena being studied.

The clear majority of participants expressed willingness to participate in remote VR studies (67%
under normal conditions and 73% during the pandemic). Participants also felt very comfortable about
the idea of participating in studies from their own homes, noticeably more so than participating in
lab studies. The survey attempts to assess the willingness of a potential participant to participate. In
the end, participation is an amalgam of many factors and is dependent on each specific study, such
as the participants actually signing up for the study and participating on it, the setup requirements
and data collection methods based on the specific research question. Thus, our obtained results

indicate an initial interest to participate from home. Our survey also indicates that participants are
comfortable about remote participation and they have VR setups which are likely to be permanent,
private and uninterrupted during participation. We believe these initial findings are beneficial when
researchers are planning remote studies.

Our results also suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic affected people in that they reported more
VR usage, and some reported having started to use their VR setups in new ways, like meetings with
friends and family. This suggests that users are open to new uses of VR, further strengthening our
belief that HMD owners are well willing to participate in remote studies.

We distributed the survey over numerous channels to limit a potential recruiting bias. Neverthe-
less, we acknowledge that it is hard to fully avoid a recruitment bias. This may have impacted the
survey results depending on the popularity of each channel chosen, as some VR platforms may
have been more/less popular.

Our results also indicate that HMD owners are highly suitable to be recruited for remote studies.
Most respondents were willing to participate in remote studies and felt comfortable about it. Their
VR setups and use also support this, as most setups seem to be permanent and used exclusively,
with a low chance of interruptions. The most notable challenge identified through our results is
that most participants have relatively small setups, which might be challenging for some studies.

4 POTENTIAL APPROACHES TO REMOTE STUDIES
In this section, we discuss potential ways to conduct remote VR studies and hypothesize about
their strengths and weaknesses. We also provide a brief discussion on app stores and social VR
platforms that could be utilized for remote VR studies.

4.1 Development of VR Applications

Standalone Applications. For most VR research projects, researchers develop a custom appli-
4.1.1
cation that runs independently. This often involves designing and modeling a digital environment,
programming the desired functionality, and designing and programming the methods for data
collection [29]. The advantage of custom-built applications it that they provide maximum flexibility
and freedom when it comes to designing the visuals, means for interaction, data collection, and
data storage, among other aspects.

Many modern tools are of great help with building VR applications. Particularly popular in this
regard is the Unity engine 6, complemented with the SteamVR plugin 7. The Unity engine is a
massively popular tool for creating games, but it is also widely used for industrial purposes, films,
and architecture, among others. As a result of its popularity, the internet is full of tutorials and
tips for Unity developers, and communities for supporting developers are plentiful and active. The
SteamVR plugin takes care of the basic communication with the head-mounted display and the
VR application – many HMDs, like the HTC Vive, support SteamVR. This greatly alleviates the
hurdles related to developing for HMDs. For the most part, developing VR applications is not any
different from general 3D development.

Despite these great tools and related resources at our disposal, it is clear that building VR
applications takes time and requires considerable software engineering expertise, and in many
cases, also expertise in other areas like visual design and 3D modeling. We also anticipate further
challenges with remote studies, as researchers have less control over the study and are more in the
dark with how participants behave. Researchers may therefore need to develop additional tools to
monitor participants or consider other ways to ensure smooth procedures.

Social VR Platforms. Another, emerging possibility for remote studies is to use social VR
4.1.2
platforms. Many of these platforms, like Rec Room and VRChat, offer diverse customization options
that might be enough for many studies. There are considerable differences between such VR
platforms in terms of their user base and what features they provide. Based on our analysis of these
platforms, we see two distinct approaches to implementing virtual environments for user studies.
First, some VR platforms allow custom applications to be uploaded. For example, VR applica-
tions built with the Unity engine can be uploaded to VRChat, as long as the applications use
the VRChat Software Development Kit (SDK). Publishing applications in VR platforms requires
that the application fulfills requirements and follows rules put forth by the platform. This may
result in more restricted possibilities as opposed to fully independent VR applications. At the same
time, these platforms are likely to bring various advantages. For example, installing and running
the application is likely less error-prone and more novice-friendly, and compatibility of different
hardware is handled by the platform rather than the application. Furthermore, it might be possible
to attract study participants from the existing user base of the platform.

Second, many VR platforms allow users to build their own environments inside the platform using
simple built-in tools, and offer customization options. This includes choosing between various
indoor and outdoor settings and adding 3D objects like furniture, interactive objects like drawing
boards, and even questionnaires. Although it is clear that these tools offer less flexibility and freedom
for researchers than fully custom-built applications, these tools make building VR environments
considerably faster and easier. Another significant advantage is that these tools are more accessible
to researchers from other fields who might have less technical expertise.

According to our survey results, the most popular VR platforms among HMD owners were
VRChat, Rec Room, and AltspaceVR. Furthermore, based on our analysis of the features of various
VR platforms (Table 2), these same platforms stand out from the others as they offer the highest
flexibility for researchers. Hence, we provide a brief overview of these three platforms. Other VR
platforms that are suitable for research purposes may emerge in the future.

Rec Room is a popular platform with more than 1 million VR users [41]. It allows users to
play and create VR games and it is compatible with several operating systems and devices.
Users can program simple logic in their custom rooms [1], making Rec Room a powerful
platform for studies that only need simple interactive features.

VRChat is a highly customizable platform. Custom worlds can be uploaded into the platform
(e.g., worlds built using Unity and the VRChatSDK), offering many features (e.g., spawn
points, interactive objects). Prior research used VRChat for studies [33], finding that this

12

Rivu et al.

was generally a useful approach that, however, came with several limitations. For example,
developers with new accounts cannot upload content without earning a certain ’trust’ level.
Furthermore, there are compatibility issues with some devices and custom content cannot
communicate with outside services.

AltspaceVR is a social VR platform supporting several devices (e.g, HTC Vive, Oculus). It
allows new world templates and world objects to be created via Unity Uploader, which can
be uploaded and shared on the official hub. Due to security reasons, no scripts are allowed8.
Developers can, however, place so-called "extensions" into their world through external web
pages that get translated into 3D content.

4.2 Distribution of VR Applications
In addition to developing and setting up their VR applications, researchers need to think about
how the applications will be distributed to participants as well as how potential participants could
be reached.

4.2.1 Direct Download. Perhaps the most straightforward option is to distribute the application
directly to participants, for example, by sending them a download link. Participants then install the
application on their own.

It is likely that this approach is relatively effortless and offers the most flexibility, as the application
does not need to conform to the rules and regulations of any external services. However, some
challenges are likely present. For example, direct installation requires users to install software from
untrusted sources (which might limit their willingness to participate) and it might generally be
more error-prone than other ways of distribution (e.g., due to lack of support during installation).

Social VR Platforms. As already discussed, social VR platforms might be utilized for remote
4.2.2
studies, as study environments can be set up through them. Since the VR application resides within
an existing platform, there is no need to explicitly distribute the application. Here, we might utilize
the existing user base of the social VR platform, or attempt to attract new users to it.

4.2.3 App Stores. Application stores offer another, potentially effective way to distribute VR
applications. Here, applications are published in app stores, such as Google Play9, Steam10, or the
Oculus Go Store11. This approach poses certain requirements to researchers. Firstly, app stores
might require the application to be developed using certain tools and programming languages.
Secondly, applications are usually subject to a review and, hence, researchers must fulfill certain
criteria regarding data protection, user interface design, etc. Thirdly, publication on app stores are
often not free of charge.

At the same time, publishing in app stores is attractive because a large audience can be reached.
Indeed, prior research has successfully distributed research prototypes through app stores in more
conventional contexts like mobile interaction [20–22]. Furthermore, since the application stores
take care of the installation process, it tends to be safe, free of errors, and easy for consumers.

We provide a brief overview of some popular application stores and their viability for publishing
applications for research purposes. Our list is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather, to provide a
general idea of the possibilities and challenges with app stores. Other app stores might be available
or emerge in the future for research purposes.

Steam is an app store particularly popular with games and VR games that support SteamVR.
One caveat of Steam is its strong focus on (commercial) games. There are only a few exceptions,
such as software for content creation. Nevertheless, it might be interesting if the research
prototype can be embedded into a game, which is particularly popular in the HCI community.
A strong advantage of Steam is that it has millions of users and that many HMDs supporting
SteamVR exist, hence allowing a large audience to be reached. Researchers need to be aware
that publishing takes at least 30 days and has a charge of about 100$ per application.

The Oculus Store is targeted at Oculus devices and, hence, cannot be used by owners of some
other popular HMDs. At the same time, the consumer base is fairly large. The store provides
clear guidelines for content publishing and the review process takes around two weeks.
After review, the content may be published live on the Oculus store or it can be shared via a
download key with participants.

The Google Play Store is immensely popular, connecting developers to millions of Android
users. The Play Store allows for publishing Android-based VR apps, which can be run on a
few HMDs and, more importantly, on any Android smart phone serving as a low-cost HMD
in a cardboard. A Google Play developer account is needed, which is available for a one
time fee of 25$. One can choose to publish based on several available modes (internal test,
closed test, open beta, full publish), called tracks. There are also other options to control the
availability of the app, like country-specific availability. These options are very useful for
researchers who might want to retain some control over how many people install their app
or who they recruit as participants. Overall, the Google Play Store is a highly viable option
for researchers, with the downside of not being an option for most high-end VR HMDs.

4.3 Summary
We identified several different ways to conduct remote VR studies. On one end of the spectrum,
researchers can produce isolated VR prototypes and distribute them directly to participants. On
the other end, researchers can set up their studies in existing VR platforms and make full use of
their features. At the same time, there are options in-between, like distributing a custom-built
application through app stores, or uploading it to a VR platform that supports custom applications.
These approaches offer a good starting point for our investigation. It is worth noting that there
are other considerations involved as well, such as how participants can best be recruited for remote
studies. We will get back to these considerations in the later chapters, when we synthesize our
findings from the online survey and the two case studies.

With these possibilities in mind, we then conducted the two case studies, which we present next.
For these studies, we identified the best ways to run them remotely, which were very different
from each other. This also allowed us to report on a wide range of experiences.

5 CASE STUDIES
To complement the online survey as well as our investigation of different approaches, we present
two case studies to gather first-hand experience. The studies we present are part of independent
research projects, in which some of the co-authors of this submission are involved. In this paper,
we focus on aspects related to the study methodology in the description of the case studies, rather
than on the main research questions of the projects and the obtained results.

5.1 Case Study 1: Health Interfaces in VR Shooters
In Case Study 1, we developed a VR shooting game (Figure 3) where study participants attempted to
shoot at drones using their VR controllers, and avoid getting hit by the drones’ lasers. Our research
focus was on investigating different ways to convey the player’s health. The player’s health was

VR contollers as pistols. One of the tested health interfaces, the watch, is visible on the user’s wrist. MIDDLE:

reduced each time they got hit by lasers, and would slowly restore if they did not get hit for enough
time. The game ended when health was reduced to zero.

We designed and implemented three different interfaces to communicate the player’s health
status. Study participants played three rounds of the game, each time with a different health
interface, and provided feedback.

In this study, the most critical aspects of the remote VR methodology were:

• Standalone VR application. We built a custom, standalone VR application. We did not use

existing platforms like Rec Room or VRChat.

• Direct download. We hosted the application on a web server and provided a link to it to

participants. Participants then downloaded the application and ran it on their own.

• Independent study method. The study was asynchronous, i.e., participants ran the study

on their own any time they wanted. No experimenter was present during the study.

Study Description. We investigated whether diegetic representations of player’s health status
5.1.1
in VR shooting games would improve the sense of presence and add to a sense of danger during
intense gaming sessions. As a non-diegetic baseline condition, the player’s health was displayed as
a health bar, which was visible on the screen at all times. As diegetic conditions, we implemented a
wristwatch displaying the player’s health (players would need to lift their wrist and really look at
the watch) (Figure 3, left) and a movement-based method, where hurt players moved slower and
their firearm was shaking, to simulate the condition of being physically hurt. We hypothesized that
these diegetic conditions would improve certain aspects of the gaming experience.

Study Design. We built a custom VR shooter game using Unity and SteamVR. In the game’s
main menu, instructions were displayed for the player. They could choose any of the three health
interfaces and start the game (Figure 3, middle). In the game, drones appeared around the player
which attempted to shoot at the player. The player’s task was to avoid getting hit and try to shoot
as many drones as possible. The game session was set to last for four minutes. To support players
of different skill levels, we implemented a dynamic difficulty system that adjusted various factors
based on how well the player performed: the rate at which the drones appeared, how spread out
they would be, and how fast and frequently they would shoot at the player. Also, we added a curve
to player health – a typical trick in videogames – so that players would not die as easily as the
situation might suggest. These were important factors in ensuring that players of all skill levels
would experience a challenge and the thrill of being low on health, which in turn was important
for our research goals. At the same time, the dynamic difficulty and the curved health would not
let players die very easily and frustrate them. Players regained their health during the session if
they remained unhurt for a brief period.

Participants played a short session using all three health interfaces. After each session, a feedback
questionnaire was automatically opened on their PC on their default browser, and the game
instructed participants to take off their HMD, fill in the form, and then return to the game (Figure
3, right). We also used the form as a means to log data from the game: we pre-filled some of the
form questions with game data and prevented users from modifying them.

Even though current research suggests filling questionnaires inside VR [3, 36], we opted for
external questionnaires. This was partly because we wanted to give players a proper break after
a potentially intense game session, but more importantly because the questionnaires were so
long that they would have been very tedious to fill in VR. The questionnaires after each session
included the Game Experience Questionnaire [27], the Slater-Usoh-Steed presence questionnaire
(e.g., [37, 42]), custom statements, and also some optional open-ended questions.

When participants filled in the form for the third and final time, they ticked a checkbox stating
that they had finished playing with all three health interfaces. At this point participants were
presented with a brief set of additional questions about their background and their experience
about participating in a remote VR study.

We took special care to provide clear instructions to participants and support them throughout the
study process. In our advertisement, we provided a brief overview of what the study would contain.
In our recruitment email, we had instructions for downloading and running the VR application
as well as the high-level steps they should take in the study. Inside the VR game, we had a text
box containing the same instructions, which the users would see immediately after starting the
application (Figure 3, middle). Further, there was a brief explanation about each health interface
before they started the game. After the game, there were instructions to take off the HMD and fill
in the questionnaire on their computer, and then return to the game (Figure 3, right). The same
reminder was added at the end of the questionnaire, that told participants to return to the game.
In addition, we set up a separate issue report form, that prospective participants were encouraged
to submit in case they experienced any problems with the game or the study. This issue report
form was added in the advertisements as well as in the emails that contained the download link.

Recruitment. We did two rounds of recruitment. In the first round, participation was voluntary,
i.e., no rewards were offered. We advertised the study through channels we had identified as
suitable for this research, such as Reddit. We also advertised the study to a practical course about
VR technologies and programming that took place at the same time at a local university. Some of
the students owned a private HMD, and some had been loaned an HMD by the university.

In the recruitment call, we included instructions for the study procedure (even though all the
instructions were in the game as well), because the study was designed to be run fully independently
and no experimenters were present at any point. It was therefore important for participants to
know exactly what to expect in the study. The call also included a direct download link to the game
as well as a link to the issue report form.

In the second round, we advertised the study through the same channels with a 10€/12$ reward,
paid via PayPal. We removed the download link from recruitment calls and instead set up a separate
registration form where participants provided basic user information as well as an email address.
We then sent the study instructions along with the download link to the registered participants.
We did this to retain control, so that no one would try to cheat (e.g, by completing the study
several times), and that we would not be flooded with too many participants who all needed to be
compensated.

This way, we recruited 24 participants (18 male, 5 female, 1 undisclosed). Their average age was
24 (SD = 7.9). The participants used a variety of different VR devices: HTC Vive Pro (7), Valve Index
(7), HTC Vive (6), Oculus Quest (2), Oculus Rift S (1), and Asus Windows Mixed Reality Headset (1).

Rivu et al.

The participants also reported their estimates on how much they play VR games on an average
week, and how much they play other digital games. With regards the VR gaming, 12 participants
(50%) reported that they play 0–5 hours on an average week. Seven (29%) estimated 5–10 hours,
four (17%) estimated 10–15 hours, and one participant (4%) estimated that they play 20+ hours
per week. With regards to other digital games, seven participants (29%) estimated that they play
0–5 hours a week, eight (33%) estimated 5–10 hours, three (13%) estimated 10-15 hours, two (8%)
estimated 15-20 hours, and four (17%) estimated that they play 20+ hours per week.

5.1.2 Participant Experience. In addition to collecting data to answer our study-specific research
questions, we gathered impressions on how the participants felt about the remote study. We asked
them to respond to three statements on a 7-point Likert scale, where 1 = strongly disagree, 4 =
neither agree nor disagree, and 7 = strongly agree.

Participants were very positive about their experience, strongly agreeing with all three statements
(MD = 7). They felt that (1) they were comfortable participating from home, (2) the instructions for
how to run the study independently were clear, and (3) they did not need anyone in the same room
to consult. One participant wrote a comment, commending us for a "smooth remote study".

The positive feedback from participants is encouraging. It supports our findings from the online
survey, where participants felt comfortable about the thought of remote participation. We were
somewhat surprised by this. Rather, we expected that the fully independent study procedure might
make some participants stressed or uncomfortable, but this did not seem to be the case. This
strengthens our belief that our procedure was well thought out and our instructions prior to and
during the study were clear (as also reported by the participants). Still, it is possible that the fully
independent procedure drove away some potential participants in the recruitment phase.

In addition to the clarity of instructions, we believe that convenience and familiarity played key
roles in the positive experience. In remote studies, users do not have to spend money and time
traveling to a lab and they do not have to get familiar with new equipment or meet with new
people. In contrast, users can participate from home. This familiar setting likely provides support
and safety. They also use their own equipment that they are familiar with before the study.

5.1.3 Experiences and Discussion of Running a Remote Study. In the first recruitment round, we
faced a major challenge with getting a sufficient number of participants. Logically, this was because
we did not compensate participants, and we required a SteamVR-compatible HMD, so low-end
devices were not suitable. A total of 10 people participated in the study. Five of them came from
the practical university course, three came from Reddit, and two from other channels.

In the second round, we immediately received 33 registrations overnight, which resulted in us
having to close the recruitment form. All who registered were sent the instructions, and 15 of
them participated. Therefore, offering a reward solved the recruitment issues. Had we kept the
registration form open for longer, we would have likely been able to recruit many more participants,
despite the pre-requisite of a SteamVR-compatible HMD. A separate registration form also seemed
to be an good choice for controlling the number of participants. Direct access to the study could
result in issues for researchers, who often have a limited budget for rewarding study participants.
One of our initial concerns was that we would suffer from a high drop-out rate (participants
quitting mid-study). However, out of the total 25 people who ran our VR application, 20 participants
(80%) completed the study in full. Four participants (16%) completed two of the three conditions,
and one participant completed only one condition. We see this as a very high completion rate
for an entirely remote and independent study procedure that took approximately 30–40 minutes.
We believe that this success was due to our efforts to provide as clear instructions as possible for
the participants to perform independently, and to make the transitions between study phases as
effortless as possible (e.g., moving from the game to a pre-opened, pre-filled questionnaire).

However, the number of second-round participants (15, of which 12 completed the study in
full) was low compared to the number of registered prospective participants (33). It is difficult to
say why so many registrants did not follow up in the end, but our experience would indicate that
researchers should prepare for this happening.

Three people reported issues through our issue report form. Those were of technical nature.
Two participants, who both had Valve Index controllers, reported that they were not able to shoot
using the triggers, but they were able to shoot by pressing other buttons. One participant reported
that their pistols were slightly misaligned with their hands. The reported issues were minor, as
participants were still able to complete the study. Still, such instances are testament to the challenges
with remote studies, as things that researchers typically have control over (e.g., calibration, testing,
solving issues on the spot) are outside of their grasp.

Conclusion. Besides initial recruitment issues (which we overcame later), the study procedure
worked very well. We did not identify major pitfalls in our procedure, which we had designed
carefully, keeping in mind that the participants do not have anyone to consult during the experiment,
and that they must be motivated to finish on their own. Furthermore, the participants gave very
positive feedback about the remote study.

As we could expect based on our survey data, our participants were dominantly male (75%).
Although there is a prevalent gender imbalance in HCI studies in general [11], this bias is still
noticeably strong. The average age of our participants was 24 (SD = 7.9). This is indeed not high,
but it is likely no lower than what HCI studies typically have. While we are not aware of an
average participant age across HCI studies, we do know that study participants are typically
students [11], and they likely fall in this range. It is also worth noting that our standard deviation
was relatively high (7.9), with some participants being over 40 years old. With respect to the
participants’ gaming habits, most were rather moderate with their VR use (0–5 hours or 5–10 hours
per week). Instead, they were more actively gaming on other devices (e.g., PC, consoles). This is not
surprising, considering the potential fatigue in VR gaming as well as the fact that VR gaming is not
yet as mature as other forms of digital gaming. In any case, our participants seemed to represent a
relatively balanced group of moderate games and hardcore gamers (judging from their play time).

5.2 Case Study 2: Investigating Proxemics in Virtual Reality using Rec Room
In Case Study 2, we set up a VR environment (Figure 4) where two participants completed collabo-
rative tasks. Our research focus was on investigating how the gender of virtual avatars affects the
interpersonal distance (IPD) between people. We measured the distance between the participants
at specific points during the study.

We designed a virtual environment in Rec Room and implemented two different collaborative
tasks, as well as implemented a sophisticated system to track the distance between participants.
Participants switched their avatar genders halfway through the study.

In this study, the most critical aspects of the remote VR methodology were:

• VR application built within an existing VR platform. We built a custom VR environ-

ment in Rec Room, using the tools provided by the platform.

• Distribution through the VR platform. Because our application was built inside Rec
Room, there was no need to download or install an application. Instead, our study was
accessible through Rec Room.

• Remotely guided study method. A remote experimenter was present during the study to

recruit users and to set up and manage the study environment in each session.

Room (used to calculate the distance between players). c: Conducting interviews at the end of the study.

Study Description. We investigated proxemics in virtual reality using Rec Room. The prox-
5.2.1
emics theory studies the interpersonal distance between humans during interaction [13]. We
explored to what extent this theory applies to virtual reality. In particular, we investigated whether
the relationship between people (strangers and friends) as well as gender affects proxemics.

Study Design. We designed a collaborative two-player game in which participants had to solve
puzzles together to unlock rewards (Figure 4a). To understand the influence of the relationship
between people on proxemics, we recruited both pairs of friends as well as pairs of strangers. To
additionally investigate the role of gender, the study consisted of two phases. In the first phase,
participants collaborated on the puzzle-solving task with an avatar matching their gender. In
the second phase, participants were represented by an avatar of the opposite gender. The study
consisted of two sessions. After the first session participants were required to go back to their own
room and change their avatar gender and then return to join for the second session of the study.
The experimenter was present in the room throughout the study. The experimenter embodied
their own avatar in the study space, provided instructions to participants and oversaw the procedure,
very much like an experimenter would do during a lab study.

The distance between the players was logged using the Rec Room feature "Range Finder" (Figure
4b), that can track the distance from a certain point to a player. However, because Rec Room does
not allow storing such information, we had to implement a workaround. We set up the Range
Finder data on a virtual display in Rec Room and recorded the data using screen capture. We then
used Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the data.

After the players finished the game, they filled in a demographics questionnaire and the experi-
menter interviewed them inside Rec Room (Figure 4c). Different rooms were designed for each
purpose so participants played the game in one room and completed the interview in a separate
room. Participants were compensated with 5€ via PayPal.

Recruitment. We distributed a call for participation via various social media platforms, university
mailing lists, in the Rec Room community on Reddit, and via Facebook. In addition, we reached out
to people active in the Rec Room community. In particular, one moderator from the Reddit Rec
Room group advertised the study via social media (Facebook). One Rec Room tutor, who hosts a
tutorial class on circuit and logic design inside the platform, suggested this study to his followers.
Furthermore, we asked participants to advertise the study to friends who might be interested. This
led to additional participants. Finally, we recruited active players in Rec Room on the fly. This
turned out to be an effective method, since those players were already in Rec Room and were often
available for participation.

For this study, we struggled to find female participants. This led us to have an imbalanced
gender ratio and, therefore, we could not conduct studies between three gender groups (male-male,
male-female, female-female) as planned initially. Eventually we had only male-male pairs (15) and
male-female pairs (5). Therefore, we had 40 participants (35 males) with an average age of 23.7
years (SD = 7.75). In general, we found the recruitment process to be fairly easy for the Rec Room
study. One drawback was a difference in time zones between the experimenter and the participants,
and thus the experimenter had to conduct some sessions at unusual hours (e.g., very late at night).

5.2.2 Participant Experience. In addition to collecting data to answer our study-specific research
questions, we gathered impressions on how the participants felt about the remote study. Hence, in
the interview at the end of the study, we asked them open-ended questions about their experience.
All 40 participants were overall very positive about the experience. All of them stated that they
felt comfortable about participation in a remote study. Furthermore, 39 participants stated that the
remote study in Rec Room was a novel experience to them; one participant mentioned to have
previously attended a focus group in Rec Room. We asked them if they faced any challenges in
understanding instructions or in participating. For all participants, it was an easy experiment and
they did not face any difficulty during the experiment.

Similar to case study 1, it is likely that participants felt positive about the experience due to the
convenience (participate from home, no need for travel or other inconveniences) and familiarity
(familiar and safe home setting, familiar equipment and platform). The difference to the first study
was that we used Rec Room with a remote experimenter, which also seemed to function very
well from the participants’ perspective. It is notable that Rec Room is a social platform where
participants likely had many interactions with other people before. Therefore, interacting with a
stranger (the remote experimenter as well as the other participants in the stranger condition) was
not new to them.

5.2.3 Experiences and Discussion of Running a Remote Study. In total we recruited 40 participants
in pairs. As many friends play together in Rec Room it was easy to recruit friends in pairs. It was
also easy to recruit strangers in pairs. For recruitment, the experimenter would generally join
playing rooms and approach other players about the study. Since each game room consists of many
players, both friends and also strangers playing altogether, recruiting was easily possible.

Our main challenge was the balanced recruitment of male and female participants. Ultimately, we
failed to do this, as recruiting female-female pairs proved to be difficult. Even though we otherwise
ran a very successful remote study, the lack of female participants limited our findings regarding
gender differences. While we also faced a bias towards males in the first case study, the issue was
more clear in this second study. This is likely due to two factors. First, we needed participants to
attend the study in pairs; finding two female participants for one session as opposed to just one
female participant is naturally more difficult. Second, according to your survey the general pool of
HMD owners (and likely Rec Room users) is male-dominated.

One important aspect to consider is that the Rec Room community consists of a large number of
users below the age of 18. Hence, proper verification of the participants’ age should be put in place
upon recruitment. At least, participants should be told that they are required to be at least 18 years
of age to be eligible to participate. But this also makes it easy for researchers to recruit underage
participants if required for the study. In this case, researchers would need to find ways of obtaining
consent from participants’ parents.

One challenge during recruitment and conducting the study sessions was that potential partic-
ipants were spread across the globe. Therefore, some participants were not available at regular
working hours for the experimenter. As a result, the experimenter ran some sessions in the middle
to accommodate for different time zones.

We planned for position tracking in VR to measure the interpersonal distance of participants.
Rec Room allows the position of each player to be visualized; however, logging this data was not
possible. We worked around this by recording the visualization during the study and then using
optical character recognition to extract the numbers. This worked well in the end, but required
some experimenting to get right, so that OCR would produce the correct output. Depending on
the study being conducted, implementation challenges are likely to occur when using existing VR
platforms, as their features can be limited.

Another design challenge specific to Rec Room was the limited ink12 available for designers. The
pen system in Rec Room allows creators to design a room and this has an ink limit to facilitate
robust processing, i.e., the rooms have a limit to how many objects they can contain. Thus, when
designing the room, we had to plan economically.

The study was interrupted a few times when the participant’s game crashed and they left the
room. Additionally, since the experimenter was also virtually present wearing an HMD device, it
was difficult for the experimenter to check their personal notes during the study.

5.2.4 Conclusion. After some creative workarounds, our overall study procedure worked very
well. We had no problems during the study sessions, the participants’ were positive about their
experience, and our data collection methods worked as intended. Recruiting participants turned
out to be easy in several ways. Most importantly, the option to directly recruit participants from
inside Rec Room was very helpful.

As noted earlier, though, it was critical for our research to also recruit female pairs as partic-
ipants, and this was a major challenge. This showcases the limitations in the demographic of
HMD users, although in most studies the issue should not be as pronounced as here. Two minor
inconveniences were that some participants were in far-away time zones, and that Rec Room had
limited data collection features, so we could not record the exact distance between participants
directly. Researchers should be prepared for creative workarounds in such cases.

6 A FRAMEWORK FOR RUNNING REMOTE VR STUDIES
In this section, we synthesize the findings from our online survey, the analysis of different ap-
proaches (standalone, app store, VR platform), and two case studies into a framework for remote
VR studies (Figure 5). We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and when each
approach might be appropriate. The framework is meant to assist researchers in planning their
own remote VR studies.

6.1 Four Primary Approaches to Remote VR Studies
We distinguish four primary approaches to conducting remote VR studies – we refer to these as
Paths 1–4. In the following, we present these four approaches and discuss their differences. In
particular, we discuss whether each path is more suitable for independent studies that participants
run without an experimenter, or remotely guided studies, where an experimenter is present. We
also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches.

6.1.1 Path 1: Standalone Application + Direct Download. In Path 1, which we experimented with
in case study 1, researchers build a standalone, independent VR application, which participants
download and install themselves. The study can then be advertised through various channels. In
our experience, VR-related forums (like VR subreddits in Reddit) worked best in attracting HMD
owners.

Fig. 5. We envision four high-level procedures to conducting remote VR studies. Paths 1 and 2 are more
ideal for studies that participants complete independently, while Paths 3 and 4 are better suited for remotely
guided studies. PATH 1: Standalone VR application that participants download and install independently.
PATH 2: Standalone VR application that is published in an app store. PATH 3: VR application that is uploaded
to an existing VR platform, which can also be used to recruit participants. PATH 4: VR application that is built
using the built-in tools of an existing VR platform, which can also be used to recruit participants.

The strengths of this approach are that independent applications can have the most extensive
functionality and the most options for collecting data, because the applications do not need to
conform to the limitations and regulations of app stores and VR platforms. In our study, we logged
extensive quantitative and qualitative data with relative ease.

Still, this approach might not be ideal for every development platform. For example, installing
external applications for Android devices requires extra steps, such as turning on developer mode,
which not every consumer is willing or even capable of doing. In our case study, this worked well,
as participants only needed to download our game package, after which they could immediately
run the game through an executable.

Researchers should consider whether or not they should distribute the download link openly.
In case participants are rewarded, researchers might consider mechanisms to control that not too
many participants take the study (e.g., so that their budget is not exceeded), and to reduce the
chances of people "hacking" the system (e.g., by completing the study and claiming the reward
multiple times). Researchers could, for example, set up a website for pre-registration, and only
registered participants would receive the download link. In our case study, this approach worked
well, although it is likely that not all pre-registrants will complete the study.

We believe Path 1 to be particularly suitable for independent studies, where participants go
through the study procedure alone, without consulting an experimenter. In our case study, this
approach worked extremely well, although the procedure should be planned meticulously. Extra
care should be paid to providing clear instructions. In best case scenarios using Path 1, the VR
application is distributed and advertised, after which the entire study runs on its own.

It is certainly possible to run experiments with a remote experimenter through Path 1, but this
requires additional steps like agreeing on specific time slots with each participant. Depending on the
study, a remote connection to the VR application would need to be developed for the experimenter,
or a connection would need to be established via other means like video conferencing tools (which
would, in turn, limit how much control the experimenter has and what insights they can gather).

22

Rivu et al.

6.1.2 Path 2: Standalone Application + Publishing through App Store. In Path 2, researchers build
a VR application and publish it in an app store. In some cases, it is possible that the app store
itself attracts participants, but researchers should be prepared to reach out to potential participants
through additional channels.

The main strengths of this approach are that distributing and installing the application is easier
and less error-prone (as opposed to independent installation), and might help in reaching a wide
and diverse audience. App stores have been commonly used in other research areas, for example,
in mobile interaction [20–22], where large participant numbers were reached. Opportunities for
data collection are still relatively extensive, although somewhat more limited than in Path 1, as the
application must conform to the rules and regulations of the app store.

Based on our analysis of existing app stores as well as own experience with publishing a VR app
on Google’s Play Store, there are considerable differences between app stores in terms of how easy
it is to publish apps (some require a review by the provider) as well as how much effort and time
they require (for some of them it takes up to 1 month to receive feedback). Researchers should
inform themselves prior to choosing a particular app store.

For the same reasons as Path 1, we believe that Path 2 is more suitable for independent studies;
in the best case scenario, studies using Path 2 could also run on their own after being advertised.

6.1.3 Path 3: Standalone Application + Upload to VR Platform. In Path 3, researchers build a VR
application and upload it to an existing VR platform, such as VRChat. The study can be advertised
through the platform itself, but also through conventional channels.

The main strengths of this approach come from the social aspects of the VR platforms. They
are built for multiple users to connect to, and interact with, each other. As such, many things
critical to some users studies are already there or can be implemented with little effort. For example,
experimenters and additional users can connect to and interact with the environment without
additional effort. In addition, the VR platforms serve as excellent recruitment channels, evidenced
by our experience with Rec Room and a prior study in VRChat [33]. Experimenters can look
for participants within the platform and recruit them on the spot. These strengths make Path 3
well-suited for remotely guided studies where an experimenter is present, and perhaps particularly
suitable for studies where multiple participants are needed simultaneously.

Publishing custom applications in VR platforms requires the application to follow certain regula-
tions, and requires that the application is implemented correctly (e.g., that it uses specific APIs and
libraries). This somewhat limits the features that can be included in the application and what kinds
of data can be collected. On the other hand, connecting an experimenter allows them to easily
conduct in-depth observations and interviews, which are more difficult with Paths 1 and 2. Using a
VR platform also helps in overcoming compatibility issues.

6.1.4 Path 4: Setup directly in VR Platform. In Path 4, researchers build the VR "application" directly
within an existing VR platform, such as Rec Room, using the platform’s built-in tools (like we
did in case study 2). The study can be advertised through the platform itself, but also through
conventional channels.

Similar to Path 3, the strengths of this approach are that experimenters can easily connect to the
study sessions and the platforms serve as excellent recruitment channels. A unique strength of
Path 4 is that the tools offered by the platforms make setting up study environments fast and easy,
as opposed to implementing custom VR apps. For example, Rec Room offers a simple user interface
for building rooms inside the platform, adding and modifying objects, and setting up interactions.
Still, the possibilities offered by VR platforms are limited, as they are rarely built for research
purposes, but for simple social interactions between users. Therefore, when considering which
path to take, researchers should look into existing VR platforms to see whether any of them offer

Remote VR Studies

23

the required functionality. A related limitation is that VR platforms offer limited ways to collect
(especially quantitative) data from users. Still, it is often possible to build questionnaires within the
platforms (like we did in Rec Room). Moreover, like in Path 3, connecting an experimenter allows
in-depth observations and interviews to be conducted.

6.2 Choosing the Best Approach for a Remote Study
The four approaches balance different needs for user studies. While most approaches can be adapted
to fit different studies one way or another, there are still general considerations that can be used to
identify the best approach. It is also worth noting that for certain VR studies, remote approaches
might not be feasible at all, or they might present significant challenges. Below, we discuss some
perspectives for evaluating which remote approach is the most feasible:

6.2.1 Consider Your Requirements for Interaction. In deciding which approach to take with a remote
VR study, researchers can consider the interactive features that their study requires, and investigate
whether existing VR platforms meet their criteria. We believe that Path 4 is generally the easiest
path to take, and, therefore, it might be useful to evaluate whether Path 4 is a feasible option in the
first place. Path 1 offers the most control over what interactive features can be included, with Paths
2 and 3 situating in the middle, being also dependent on the targeted app store or VR platform.

6.2.2 Consider Your Requirements for Data Collection. Similar to the required interactive features,
researchers should consider the data that they need to collect. Remote studies in general are more
limited than lab studies, and collecting data through specialized hardware such as biosensors,
electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) is very challenging. Despite current
technology making a greater range of data available (such as eye tracking data), additional hardware
requirements constrain remote studies. Hence, remote studies are not always possible.

Setting specialized hardware requirements aside, more typical data can certainly be collected
remotely. Much like with with interactive features, Path 1 offers the most control over what data
can be logged from the application. Path 2 also offers much control over logged data, although
some app stores might impose some limitations. Paths 1 and 2 are therefore well suited particularly
for gathering quantitative data.

Because VR platforms limit data logging – for privacy and safety reasons – Paths 3 and 4 are less
ideal for collecting quantitative data. However, some limited options may still be available, and
also some workarounds exist. For example, as demonstrated in case study 2, we were unable to log
participant positions from Rec Room. We obtained the required data using screen capture and OCR
to extract the data. This was a successful workaround, yet required additional effort from us in
terms and planning and experimentation, and we also had to purchase additional OCR software.
In contrast, with qualitative data the advantages may be flipped. Because Paths 3 and 4 are
well suited for studies where an experimenter is present, they are — by extension — suitable
for collecting qualitative data through observations and interviews. Collecting qualitative data
through Paths 1 and 2 is certainly possible, but may require additional effort. For example, for
standalone applications, the possibility for a remote experimenter to connect to the same session
as the participant must be implemented, or they must use additional software to connect for the
sessions. Video conferencing tools may be helpful here. However, despite their ease of use they still
add additional steps to the procedure and might not be enough to capture all details in the session.
Therefore, studies relying heavily on quantitative data (or the collection of large amounts of data)
might benefit more from Paths 1 and 2. For studies with a qualitative focus, Paths 3 and 4 could be
considered. We again emphasize that these are not set in stone. For example, with Paths 1 and 2,
video conferencing tools, screen sharing tools, etc. could be used to connect with participants, but
they are still limited and require extra steps in the procedure.

Rivu et al.

6.2.3 Consider the Advantages and Drawbacks of Independent and Remotely Guided Studies. As
already discussed, independent studies likely support quantitative data, while remotely guided
studies might support qualitative data. There are also other considerations to these two approaches.
For independent (asynchronous) studies, the benefits are that since the actual procedure requires
no resources, the study can run day and night and potentially reach a large number of participants.
For certain studies, it is also considerably easier to develop a VR application if one does not
have to worry about functionality surrounding the experimenter. However, due to the lack of
an experimenter, independent studies might be more prone to malfunctions (e.g., bad calibration,
hardware issues) and misunderstandings (e.g., not following the procedure correctly), or participants
might simply be overwhelmed or discouraged by the procedure.

In contrast, through a remote connection, experimenters can instruct participants and oversee
that the procedure is followed accordingly. Especially, they can tackle any unforeseen events and
provide support if problems occur, and conduct observations and interviews. Remote guidance
might be particularly desirable if the participants need to learn or train new things, if the procedure
has several phases with instructions, or if the study has multiple things running in parallel, like
several participants. A case in point is our case study 2, where participants attended the sessions in
pairs. This study would have been very difficult to run without an experimenter who was required
to monitor each session and instruct participants accordingly, especially when considering the
limitations of the used VR platform. The obvious drawback is that an experimenter is then tied
to running each study session, which takes time. Experimenters might also face challenges with
different time zones; flexibility with schedules might be needed to reach participants located in
other countries.

6.2.4 Reflections on the Longevity of the Framework. Here, we briefly reflect on how we believe
this framework and the different approaches to remote VR studies might evolve in the long term.
It is inevitable that the VR landscape, the tools, and the user base will evolve. However, we have
formulated most of our findings and considerations in such a way that they will still hold despite
the changes that we expect to see in the future.

We have only recently arrived at a situation where a notable enough number of people own
head-mounted displays. But VR technologies and the related tools are still relatively immature, and
the number of people who own HMDs is still marginal to that of mainstream devices. We believe
that in the future, remote VR studies in general will become easier, as VR technologies develop and
a larger audience becomes equipped and acquainted with head-mounted displays—and possibly
other VR devices in the far future.

Through the future advancement of VR technologies, we may eventually have more data col-
lection opportunities in remote studies. However, we believe that studies using app stores and
especially studies using social VR platforms will continue to be limited in their data collection.
Such limitations are in place for good reasons—to protect the privacy and safety of the users—so
this is unlikely to change. Hence, Path 1 (standalone application + direct download) might benefit
the most from advanced data collection, which we believe is already the most flexible in this regard.
Data collection limitations aside, it is reasonable to assume that social VR platforms will continue
to develop alongside HMDs, and offer more advanced and comprehensive interactive options as
well as tools for content creators. Therefore, we believe that Paths 3 and 4 (that utilize social VR
platforms) will become a feasible option for a wider range of studies.

7 BEST PRACTICES & LESSONS LEARNED
In this section, we draw upon our results and experiences, and provide some best practices and
lessons learned that we hope help researchers while planning their remote VR studies.

Remote VR Studies

25

7.1 Understand HMD Users and Demographic Limitations
Even though it is possible to reach a large number of participants remotely compared to a lab study,
remote studies may suffer from certain demographic limitations. As we learned from our survey,
HMD owners are biased towards young males. This is also evidenced by our two case studies,
where the majority of participants were male (75% and 87.5%, respectively).

The bias towards male participants was particularly a challenge in our second case study, where
we initially attempted to investigate gender differences. However, due to the difficulties of finding
female pairs, we had to exclude them and opt for an investigation between male-male pairs and
mixed gender pairs. Hence, we received only limited insight into gender differences.

It is worth noting that the bias towards males is not necessarily solely due to the imbalance
among HMD owners, but also due to the gender imbalance in suitable recruitment platforms (e.g.,
Reddit, Rec Room). In any case, researchers looking to utilize HMD owners as study participants
should be aware of this limitation, particularly if gender balance is important with respect to the
insights of the planned study.

As an advantage, however, online recruitment platforms allow pre-selecting participants based on
demographics (e.g selecting participants who own a VR HMD). Recruitment in online VR platforms
is easy as experimenters are likely to find available players online.

7.2 Home VR Setups May be Small
According to our survey, many home VR setups are smaller than what researchers might be used
to in lab conditions. 29% of respondents reported a small space of up to only 5 𝑚2, while another
31% reported a space between 5 and 10 𝑚2. Therefore, it might be challenging to conduct studies
that require more space. This may be especially true for user studies researching locomotion in
VR or collaboration in social VR. At the very least, researchers should be clear about their space
requirements and implement mechanisms to ensure the safety of remote participants.

7.3 Recruit Participants via VR Platforms
In case study 2, where we set up our study in Rec Room, an effective way to recruit participants was
to look for them from within Rec Room. Since Rec Room users are already using their HMD and
are already within the platform, many of them were available for participation on the spot. This
indicates that studies utilizing VR platforms (Paths 3 and 4), researchers might want to consider
recruiting participants from within the platform.

7.4 Identify the Rules of Subgroups in Forums and Social Media
VR-related groups on various forums and social media platforms, especially Reddit, were also ideal
locations for recruiting participants. However, many such platforms not only have their general
community rules, but many subgroups have their own rules. Researchers should identify groups
where posting study advertisements is allowed, and contact moderators in cases where the rules do
not provide the necessary information.

7.5 Set up a Channel for Participants to Report Issues in Independent Studies
In case study 1, we set up a separate issue report form that we linked to in the original advertisement.
Although we luckily did not run into any major issues, some participants still used it to report
minor things that they had trouble with. Because of the lack of control and knowledge over
how participants run the study, we recommend that researchers set up a similar channel for
independent studies. This is particularly valuable with issues that altogether prevent a participant
from completing the study, potentially making researchers aware of major issues early on.

Rivu et al.

7.6 Ensure a Flexible Schedule in Remotely Guided Studies
Potential study participants can be located anywhere in the world and hence they might be in a
totally different time zone. In our case study 2, where we used a remote experimenter, this meant
that some studies had to be run during the night to suit the participants’ schedules. Of course,
recruiting participants from several continents is not always necessary, but being able to recruit a
more diverse set of participants is one of the strengths of remote studies.

7.7 Make Notes Accessible for Remote Experimenters
In our case study 2, an unforeseen challenge was that it was occasionally difficult for the exper-
imenter to check their notes while wearing an HMD. There are several solutions to this. One
practical consideration is for experimenters to have the notes on their person instead of, e.g., on a
table. In the latter case, experimenters may be disoriented when taking off the HMD, or they may
be far away from the table, and may, therefore, need some time to locate their notes. A second
consideration is that many VR platforms, such as Rec Room, can be used on desktop machines as
well. This might be a more ideal way in some studies for the experimenters to connect from, instead
of using an HMD. A third consideration is that it might be possible to put the experimenter’s notes
within the virtual world, so that the notes are only visible to them.

7.8 Review Ethical Concerns and Ensure Transparency about Potential Risks
VR technologies are associated with health and privacy risks [6, 12, 23, 38], for example, through
cybersickness [12, 15], physical injuries [30]), and effects on mental health [2, 24]. The privacy
risks of VR technology should also not be neglected, as large amounts of sensitive information
may be involved, while access to and transmission of this data is often not transparently regulated
[6, 16]. These risks imply a need for reflections on the ethical consequences of VR studies, since
they can affect participants. Remote VR studies could even aggravate the moral concerns as they
are less controlled.

Ethical concerns must be addressed to ensure safety and security of the participants. For example,
the absence of an on-site researcher means no assistance to the participants in case of health
issues. For remote studies, having a remote experimenter present during the study can improve the
safety of the participants as the remote experimenter can monitor the participants and stop the
study if required. Using internet to download study links or participating online may pose security
threats to participants. We strongly suggest that researchers make their best effort to minimize
such threats by using verified and trusted sources, such as official institution websites, to host study
advertisements, information, and materials (like download links), instead of public sources such as
links on Google Drive. Researchers can also focus on distributing studies in forums where safety
measures exist (e.g., new accounts cannot make new posts, a certain trust level must be earned, or
the community can help by marking safe and valid posts with badges or tags).

Therefore, we recommend a thoughtful consideration of all health and privacy risks and their
mitigation. Moreover, transparent communication of risks to the participants is necessary to allow
for an informed consent.

8 CONCLUSION
We investigated different ways to conduct VR studies remotely, using the participants’ own VR
equipment. We first conducted an online survey (N=227) to understand HMD owners demographics,
their VR setups and usage, and their willingness to participate in remote VR studies. Second, we
analyzed existing app stores and social VR platforms to assess how suitable they would be to
be utilized in remote VR studies, and what advantages and limitations they might bring. Third,

we conducted two case studies to gather experiences from different approaches. Based on these
contributions, we derived a framework, guiding researchers planning to conduct remote VR studies.
Our framework features four plausible paths to conduct remote VR studies. We learned that
remote studies come with unique opportunities, challenges and considerations. The most defining
factors in designing a suitable VR study for each purpose are 1) whether to utilize existing VR
platforms or app stores, or to implement a standalone VR application, and 2) whether the study is
run independently by participants, or guided by a remote experimenter.

We also identified best practices and lessons learned. Together with them and the framework,
we believe that our work helps researchers to identify the best possible approach for their remote
VR studies, and to anticipate potential pitfalls. As VR technologies keep advancing and more VR
devices find their way into people’s homes, we believe our work to be valuable to a growing number
of researchers and practitioners.
