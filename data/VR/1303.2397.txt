A Comparison of the Velocity Parameters of SiO v=1, J=1-0 
and J=2-1 Maser Emission in Long Period Variables 

Abstract 

We present an analysis of velocity parameters derived from multi-epoch observations of 
the SiO maser spectra of 47 long period variables (LPVs). The velocity parameters are 
important to inform and constrain theoretical models of SiO maser emission and to 
extract information on binary orbits. Mira and R Aquarii (R Aqr) are two known binaries 
included in the program. The 47 LPVs are among 121 sources of the Australia 
Telescope National Facility (ATNF) Mopra telescope’s monitoring program. 
Observations were carried out several times a year between 2008 and 2012 and are 
continuing. The SiO spectra are from the v=1, J=1-0 (43.122 GHz; hereafter J10) and 
the v=1, J=2-1 (86.2434 GHz; hereafter J21) transitions. For 41 of the 47 LPVs we 
observed both transitions nearly simultaneously in 457 observations. We have 
determined and compared the velocity centroids (VCs) and velocity ranges of emission 
(VRs) suffixed as above (10 and 21) for the two transitions - VC10, VC21, VR10, and 
VR21. The VCs of the two transitions are, on average, within 0.13 km s-1 of each other 
but are sometimes separated by a few km s-1. The VC10s are, on average, slightly more 
positive than the VC21s. The values of the VCs in the two transitions have been 
compared to justify using both of these transitions to extract binary star orbital 
parameters. The arithmetic mean VR10 derived from 635 observations of 47 sources is 
6.4 km s-1 with a standard deviation of 3.4 km s-1 while the mean VR21 derived from 
485 observations of 41 sources is 4.2 km s-1 with a standard deviation of 2.8 km s-1. The 
number of occurrences of VR10 and VR21versus velocity range have different 
distributions. The differences in the VRs indicate that the J21 and J10 emissions arise 
from dynamically different regions of the circumstellar environment. 

1. Background 

1.1 VCs and VRs 

The VC can be thought of as the “center of mass” of the maser emission. The VC 

tracks the motion of the emission. It is assumed that, over time, the changes in the VC 
of the maser emission track the changes in the velocity of the actual center of mass of 
the stellar system. McIntosh (2006) showed that the VC of SiO maser emission varies 
with a standard deviation of 1.5 km s-1 to 2 km s-1 over time for LPVs not thought to be 
in binary sytems. Variations in excess of this standard deviation may indicate 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
asymmetries, circumstellar or planetary orbits, the binary nature of the system, or other 
interesting physics.  

Mathematically, the VC is the sum of the antenna temperature (Ta) in each 
velocity channel times the velocity with respect to the local standard of rest (vlsr) of the 
velocity channel over the range of emission divided by the sum of the Ta in each velocity 
channel over the range of emission. 

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

The summations extend over the range of emission.  

The VR is calculated to be the region where the Ta exceeds three times the 

standard deviation of the antenna temperature of the background noise. The standard 
deviation is determined from velocity channels far away from the emission range of the 
source, which, given the IF bandwidth of 137 MHz and resolution of 4096 channels is 
easily obtainable by masking the central emission. 

Analysis and comparison of the VRs has received little attention. VRs and their 

phase dependence are commonly displayed in modeled spectra but values are not 
explicitly presented. VR similarities or differences among transitions provide information 
on the dynamics of the region in which the masers originate.  

1.2 Binary Stars 

The VCs of SiO masers and other molecular transitions have been used in 
attempts to determine the orbital parameters of R Aqr. R Aqr is an LPV, an SiO maser 
source, and a symbiotic star. Its period has been predicted from an analysis of the VCs 
of various molecules and transitions to be 35 years (McIntosh and Rustan 2007 
hereafter MR07) or 44 years (Gromadski and Mikolajewska 2009 hereafter GM09). 
MR07 and GM09 assumed that different transitions of the same or different 
molecules tracked the same stellar velocity. The Mopra data base has been analyzed to 
check this assumption with the J21 and J10 transitions. Simultaneous observations with 
the other transitions are not available to verify the assumption more generally. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.3 Observations of Maser Locations and VRs 

Phillips et al. (2003) simultaneously viewed the J21 and J10 transitions around R 

Cassiopeia. The J10 emission had a higher flux density and more observed features, 
but the VRs were 4 km s-1 to 5 km s-1 for both transitions. The results indicated that the 
two transitions “form at comparable radii from R Cas.” Soria-Ruiz et al. (2004) observed 
X Cyg  and concluded “the size of the emitting regions is comparable,” and the 
autocorrelation spectra showed a VR10 of ~9 km s-1 and VR21 ~12 km s-1. Soria-Ruiz 
et al. (2004) found that for IRC +10011 the J21 emission was located “50% further 
away” from the assumed centroid of emission compared to the J10 emission. The 
autocorrelation spectra for IRC+10011 showed a VR10 of ~10 km s-1 and VR21 ~9 km 
s-1. A map of the emission from various transitions for IRC +10011 is found in Colomer 
et al. (2009). The J21 “shows a significantly different spatial distribution,” and is further 
from the star than the J10 emission. Colomer et al. (2009) does not include any spectra.   
In TX Cam Soria-Ruiz et al. (2006) found that the angular size of the J21 region was 
larger than the J10 region. The velocity ranges of emission in the two transitions appear 
similar in the published spectra. For R Leo (Soria-Ruiz et al. 2007) the J21 emission is 
produced in a “clearly farther shell” than the J10 and the velocity range of the J10 
exceeds that of the J21 emission. R Leo, the only source observed by VLBI in both J10 
and J21 and included in the Mopra program, the autocorrelation spectra indicate a 
VR10 of ~16 km s-1 and VR21 of ~12 km s-1. These observations indicate that the 
distance of the J21 emission is comparable to or greater than the distance of the J10 
emission from the central star, but do not indicate a clear relationship between 
 VR10 and VR21. 

1.4 Theoretical Models of Maser Velocity Parameters and Locations 

Gray et al. (2009; hereafter G09) have investigated the dynamics of the 

circumstellar region in which the SiO masers originate and have provided the most 
thoroughly developed theory for the maser spectra in LPVs. They model and depict a 
shock traveling out from the star generating different velocities, red shifted or more 
positive and blue shifted or more negative, at different distances from the star. As the 
shock travels out the velocities change as a function of distance from the star and 
phase. G09 predicted a VR10 of ~10 km s-1. From the graphs in G09 the VR21s are 
generally smaller than VR10s, but the difference is phase dependent and difficult to 
quantify. According to the information presented in G09 a redward shift of the spectral 
peak with increasing phase for J10 is predicted, but no phase averaged VC shift 
between the two transitions is obvious. G09 indicate that the J21 emission should 
originate at similar or greater distances from the star than the J10 emission depending 
on the phase. 

Yun & Park (2012; hereafter YP12) have developed an SiO maser emission 

model for LPVs that takes into account the complex velocity field of the circumstellar 

 
 
 
 
 
region using a coupled escape probability. The graphs in this work indicate VR21s 
exceeding the VR10s at all epochs presented. No clear difference between VC21 and 
VC10 are indicated at any epoch. The J21 emission is generated at similar or slightly 
greater distances from the star than the J10 emission in this model. 

Since different distances from the star are affected differently by the proposed 

shock travelling out from the star, it is reasonable to expect that masers forming at 
different distances from the star will exhibit different VRs and slightly different VCs. The 
observations of the velocity parameters of the emission provide information on the 
locations as well as the motion of the masing material. 

2. Observations 

The 22-m Mopra radio telescope is located in New South Wales, Australia. At 

Mopra each maser source is first pointed on to ascertain adequate positioning inside the 
beam. The observations are then executed as 16 cycles on and 16 cycles off 
observation, thus lasting 64 seconds per on/off pair. For J21 observations the rms noise 
was about 1.8 Jy. For J10 observations the rms noise was about 0.6 Jy. The velocity 
(J21). VR10 averages 6.4 km s-1 or 
resolution was 0.23 km s-1
about 28 velocity channels. VR21 averages 4.2 km s-1 or about 34 velocity channels. 
The velocity resolution is therefore about 3% to 3.5% of the average velocity range and 
limits the accuracy of VCs and VRs to approximately 0.2 km s-1.   

(J10) and 0.12 km s-1

The Mopra monitoring program observed 121 sources between 2008 and early 

2012 and is continuing with a reduced rate of observations. Long period variables 
(LPVs), semi-regular variables (SRVs), irregular variables, OH-IR stars, and the Orion 
SiO maser source were observed approximately monthly in J10 and J21. Two of the 
LPVs, Mira and R Aqr, are known to be binary stars. It has been suggested that L2 
Puppis, an SRV included in the Mopra program, is a binary star (Goldin & Makarov 
2007) 

LPVs were chosen for this analysis because they present a relatively uniform 

collection of sources and a group of stars for which theoretical models of the SiO maser 
emission have been developed. The 47 LPVs observed, epoch of the first simultaneous 
or J10 observation, the number of observations in each transition, and the number of 
observations of both transitions within 24 hours are given in Table 1. These sources are 
listed in the AAVSO Bulletin (2011) as LPVs with well determined maxima and periods.   

3. Velocity Parameters and Results 

Table 2 presents the VC10, VC21, VR10, and VR21 for each source determined 

at the first epoch of observation. Included in Table 2 is the number of times the 
magnitude of the difference between VC21 and VC10 is greater than 2 km s-1. The 
number of occurrences of these large VC differences is indicated by the signs of the 
difference. Sources with occurrences of VR21 > VR10 are indicated by bullets. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1 VC Comparison 

We determined the difference in velocity for 457 pairs of VC10s and VC21s from 

41 LPVs. Six LPVs were not detected in J21. The VC pairs are from the same source 
and were obtained within 24 hours of each other. The arithmetic mean of the differences 
between the VC21 and the VC10 is -0.1 km s-1 with a standard deviation (square root of 
the sample variance) of 1.1 km s-1.  

Figure 1 displays the histogrammed results of VC21 – VC10. The distribution is 

not particularly well described by the Gaussian fit to the histogrammed data. The poor fit 
is most obviously indicated by the number of occurrences beyond -2 km s-1 compared to 
the Gaussian fit. The Gaussian fit maximum occurs at +0.1 km s-1 and the fit Gaussian 
sigma is 0.8 km s-1.  

The poor fit may exist because the velocity parameters at one observations of a 

source are related to the parameters observed a few weeks to a few months later. 
Gaussian distributions apply to randomly occurring events. McIntosh and Bonde (2010) 
determined SiO maser features for Mira to have an average lifetime of 171 days. This 
lifetime is much longer than the average time between measurements of the Mopra 
program. 

The VC differences displayed in Figure I are not symmetric about the average 

value. The differences indicate that more VC21s are within about 1 km s-1 of the 
average while many VC10s are red shifted several km s-1 from the average difference.  
There may be an unknown physical reason for the J10 emission to be more redshifted 
than the J21 emission. For individual sources the VC21 and VC10 may differ by several 
km s-1 at specific epochs. 

Since VC10s generally have a standard deviation of 1.5 km s-1 to 2.0 km s-1 over 

time (McIntosh 2006), the observations that the VCs of the two transitions are usually 
within approximately 1 km s-1 of each other justifies combining VC10s and VC21s to 
track changes in the VCs of sources. GM09 made this assumption in fitting the velocity 
curve of R Aqr to extract the binary parameters.  

Knowing the general variations of VCs, individual source spectra can be 
examined for the existence of periodic variations. It has been suggested (Struck et al. 
2002; Cohanim 2002) that planets may orbit LPVs in the circumstellar environment and 
affect the SiO maser emission. Such planets, if they exist, should be detectable through 
long term studies of maser VCs, VRs, or the motions of individual maser features. 
Presently no observational evidence exists to support the presence of these planets.  

In future work we will analyze the VCs of the Mira and R Aqr emission over time, 

including these Mopra data, to determine their binary parameters. We will also search 
the VCs of other program sources for periodicities indicating binary partners, planets, or 
other interesting physics.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Four sources, R Hor, RS Vir, RR Aql, and S Gru, the VC21 – VC10 difference 

has a negative value and a magnitude greater than 2 km s-1 on at least three epochs as 
indicated in Table 2. Only one star, R Cnc, shows VC21 – VC10 > +2 km s-1 at more 
than one epoch. The large VC differences often indicate that features are present in the 
one transition that are not present in the other transition. The reason for the 
predominance of red shifted VC10s with respect to the VC21s is not known. Future 
observations may determine if these large differences are chronic conditions or short 
term statistical variations. If the large VC differences continue, VLBI observations of 
these sources might indicate an unusual geometry or location of the maser features.  

As stated above the VC10s are generally more positive (red shifted) than the 

VC21s. It is difficult to compare this result, even qualitatively, with the G09 and YP12  
models. The G09 modeled spectra indicate a blue shifted J10 emission compared to the 
J21 emission for some combinations of phase and dust regime. Other combinations 
produce a relative red shift of J10 compared to J21. The graphs in YP12 indicate that 
the VCs are approximately equal for all epochs presented. The Mopra spectra will have 
to be analyzed as a function of stellar phase in order to make a more detailed 
comparison with the predictions. 

3.2 VR Comparison 

The arithmetic mean of the VR10s is 6.4 km s-1 with a standard deviation of 3.4 
km s-1. Figure 2 shows the histogrammed VR10s. The number of occurrences versus 
VRs in 1 km s-1 windows has been fit by a Poisson distribution (Bevington & Robinson 
1992) . The Poisson distribution is defined by µ, the mean of the Poisson distribution, 
and (cid:305), the standard deviation of the Poisson distribution. This distribution is often used 
to model histogrammed data with a relatively small number of data points. Assuming a 
Poisson distribution, the µ of the VR distribution is 5.6 km s-1 with a (cid:305) of 2.4 km s-1. The 
peak number of occurrences is in the 2 km s-1 to 3 km s-1 range although the distribution 
is fairly flat from 2 km s-1 through 6 km s-1. Again the Poisson distribution does not fit the 
data very well. This poor fit again may be affected by the non-random relationship of the 
emission of a source from one observation to another. Both the VR10 arithmetic mean 
and the Poisson fit µ are considerably smaller than the ~10 km s-1 stated by G09 for the 
VR10.  

The arithmetic mean of the VR21s is 4.2 km s-1 with a standard deviation of 2.8 

km s-1. Figure 3 shows the histogrammed VR21s. The fit Poisson distribution indicates a 
µ of 2.8 km s-1 with a (cid:305) 1.7 km s-1. The peak number of occurrences is in the 1 to 2 km 
s-1 range. 

The results shown in Figs 2 and 3 indicate that the J10 emission occurs over a 

larger VR than the J21 emission. This result is qualitatively consistent with the 
predictions of G09. The modeled spectra presented in G09 indicate a VR10 that 
exceeds the VR21 by approximately 1 km s-1 at all phases and for all dust regimes.  

 
 
 
  
 
 
The YP12 modeled spectra show the VR21 as larger than the VR10 for all epochs and 
is not consistent with the observations.    

Figure 4 shows the range of VR21 versus the VR10 for simultaneous 

observations. For only 17 of the 457 simultaneous observations does the VR21 exceed 
the VR10. The sources and the number of times VR21 exceeded VR10 are indicated in 
Table 2. So on average, and for almost all individual, simultaneous, pairs of 
observations the VR10 exceeds the VR21. 

The difference in VR10 and VR21 may be associated with a difference in location 
or the range of possible locations of the masers in the two transitions. The J21 emission 
appears to occur in a region of the circumstellar envelop that generates features moving 
at a smaller velocity with respect to the central star. The limited VLBI data available 
indicate that the J21 emission arises further from the star than the J10 emission at least 
in some cases. The J21 has not been observed closer to the star.   

4. Future Work 

In further analysis of the database we will focus on the VR and VC as a function 

of phase for these LPVs. The phase dependent analysis will allow a much more 
complete comparison with the predictions of G09 and YP12. The variations of the VCs 
of individual sources will also be analyzed to look for evidence of binarity or periodic 
changes in the velocity structure of the source. 

The phase relationship between the VRs of different transitions has not been 
previously investigated. A previously existing data set of the v = 0, 1, and  2; J = 1-0 
transitions (McIntosh 2006), along with the Mopra data set, can now be examined for 
correlations among the transitions, VRs, and stellar phase. Such correlations may 
provide evidence for the relative locations of the masers in different transitions and the 
motion of the proposed shocks through the maser region. 

We will search the acquired spectra for periodic variations in VCs, VRs, and 

features. Such variations could indicate binarity, planets, or other interesting physical 
changes. 

5. Conclusions 

The Mopra database provides the first large data set of LPV SiO maser spectra 

(essentially simultaneous observations in J21 and J10 over the last 4 years) to allow the 
comparison of the VCs and VRs for the J10 and J21 transitions. The velocity 
comparisons extracted from these observations will inform and constrain the 
development of future models of the circumstellar environment and maser dynamics. 

The analysis of simultaneously acquired J10 and J21 VCs justify the assumption 
that these values can both be used in the extraction of binary parameters. The average 
difference in the VCs of these two transitions is very small compared to the time 
variation of the VCs.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The J10 emission shows a larger VR than the J21 emission. This result indicates 

that the two transitions originate in different parts of the circumstellar envelope and 
experience the proposed shock propagation differently. The larger VR10 is qualitatively 
consistent with the predictions of G09. However a detailed comparison of the predicted 
and observed J10 and J21 VCs and VRs is not possible at this point.
