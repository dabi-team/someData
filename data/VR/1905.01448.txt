ABSTRACT

≥

We investigated eﬀects on ﬂow variables of transonic advection-dominated accretion ﬂows (ADAFs)
for diﬀerent outer boundary locations (BLs) with a changing energy constant (E) of the ﬂow. We used
r−p) with
the ADAF solutions and investigated a general power index rule of a radial bulk velocity (vr ∝
diﬀerent BLs, but the power index with radius for a rotation velocity and sound speed is unchanged.
Here, p
0.5 is a power index. This power rule gives two types of self-similar solutions; ﬁrst, when
p = 0.5 gives a self-similar solution of a ﬁrst kind and exists for inﬁnite length, which has already been
discovered for the ADAFs by Narayan & Yi, and second, when p > 0.5 gives a self-similar solution
of a second kind and exists for ﬁnite length, which corresponds to our new solutions for the ADAFs.
By using this index rule in ﬂuid equations, we found that the Mach number (M ) and advection factor
(fadv) vary with the radius when p > 0.5. The local energies of the ADAFs and the Keplerian disk
are matched very well at the BLs. So, this theoretical study is supporting a two-zone conﬁguration
theory of the accretion disk, and we also discussed other possible hybrid disk geometries. The present
study can have two main implications with a variation of the p; ﬁrst, one that can help with the
understanding of outﬂows and non-thermal spectrum variations in black hole candidates, and second,
one that can help with solving partial diﬀerential equations for any sized advective disk.

1. INTRODUCTION

An accretion disk is powered by many galactic and extragalactic space objects, e.g., compact objects, gamma-
ray bursts, and young stellar objects. The compact objects are very compact and have a very high surface gravity
compared to normal stars, e.g., black holes (BHs), neutron stars, and white dwarfs.
In an accretion process, the
accreting matter is compressed and becomes hotter, but may cool down by emitting radiation (Bowyer et al. 1965;
Gallo et al. 2003; Fender et al. 2004), and some part of the accreting matter may eject in the form of bipolar
jets/outﬂows (Mirabel et al. 1992; Junor et al. 1999; Doeleman et al. 2012). These accreting sources also show
spectral states variation in their activity cycles (Gallo et al. 2003; Fender et al. 2004), e.g., BH X-ray binaries
(BHXBs). The BHXBs typically have two types of spectral states; one low/hard state (LS), which is radiatively
ineﬃcient and dominated by a power-law component with hard X-ray radiation, and second high/soft state (HS),
which is radiatively eﬃcient and dominated by multicolored blackbody radiation. These two states are connected with
many intermediate hard/soft states (Fender et al. 2004). During the LS to intermediate/hard state, the BHXBs have
weak or mildly relativistic to relativistic jets with quasi-periodic oscillations, but both features disappear during the
HS. Interestingly, the disk’s inner radius also decreases from LS to HS (Fender et al. 2004). These states and state
transitions are thought to be manifested by the change in the disk size in the two-zone conﬁguration theory of the
accreting disks (Esin et al. 1997; Das & Sharma 2013).

There are many accretion models that have explained many observed features of the black hole candidates (BHCs),
e.g., BHXBs and active galactic nuclei. The ﬁrst popular and algebraic Keplerian disk (KD) model was given by

Kumar & Gu

Shakura & Sunyaev (1973). Which was basically nonadvective, optically thick, and had a cool ﬂow, but it nicely
explained the soft spectrum of the BHCs. Since this model was cool and ad hoc, therefore failed to explain other
states of the BHCs. Lightman & Eardley (1974) also pointed out that the inner region of the disk was viscously and
thermally unstable. After this, many attempts were made to satisfy the inner boundary of the BH with advective
nature of the ﬂow, which can explain the nonthermal part of the spectrum and the outﬂows. In the present study is
also one of the attempts to fulﬁll the inner region of the KD with the help of ADAF solutions of diﬀerent sizes. There
are many hot advective models that have been developed for the accretion disk, e.g., Thick tori (Paczy´nski & Wiita
1980), shock solutions (Chakrabarti 1989), and ADAFs (Narayan & Yi 1994). The shock solutions and ADAFs are
generated from the same set of the ﬂuid equations with diﬀerent outer boundary conditions (BCs), which is explained
on the basis of the energy constant of motion in this paper. All the advective accretion models stated above have
diﬀerent angular momentum distributions, and therefore the ﬂows can have a single (inner or outer), or multiple
critical points (CPs). The hot advective models are good at explaining the nonthermal part of the spectrum and the
outﬂows. But intermediate states of the BHCs can be explained by the combination of the hot advective disk and the
KD, making a hybrid disk (Esin et al. 1997). So, there are many studies made for the uniﬁcation of the hybrid disks
(or two-zone conﬁguration theory) in order to make complete picture of observed states of the BHCs, like coupling of
the ADAF and KD by Honma (1996); Manmoto & Kato (2000); Gracia et al.
(2003); Meyer & Meyer-Hofmeister
(1994); Gu & Lu (2000); Meyer et al. (2000); Lu et al. (2004) and some authors with opposing opinions of this pair,
e.g., Dullemond & Turolla (1998); Molteni et al.
(2001). Here, we believe in the uniﬁcation of the hybrid model,
although both kinds of the models are generated from diﬀerent kinds of assumptions with ﬂuid equations. Since the
KD is a purely governed by algebraic equations, and used easily for the modeling of the soft spectrum of the BHCs,
but is hard to combine with the inner transonic advective ﬂow by ﬂuid diﬀerential equations, we therefore used the
technique of a self-similar solution approach of intermediate boundaries (Barenblatt & Zol’dovich 1972), which are
obtained with the help of the transonic ADAF solutions. So together they can make the use of both models easier
for the studies of the variation of the spectral states of the BHCs and outﬂows, by using the two-zone conﬁguration
accretion theory.

The self-similar solutions are qualitatively good with ADAFs (Narayan & Yi 1994; Narayan et al. 1997). They
are used to simplify partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) into ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) of the ﬂuid for
the studies of two-dimensional (2D) disk structures, with and without outﬂows, by many authors (Narayan & Yi
1995a; Xu & Chen 1997; Blandford & Begelman 1999, 2004; Xue & Wang 2005; Xie & Yuan 2008; Gu et al.
2009; Jiao & Wu 2011; Gu 2012, 2015; Jiao et al.
2015) for HD ﬂows and MHD ﬂows (Samadi & Abbassi
2016; Mosallanezhad et al.
2018;
Bu & Mosallanezhad 2018), and also for the investigation of disk nonthermal radiation (Narayan & Yi 1995b).
r0.5. The implications
These authors have used the self-similar solution of the ﬁrst kind, and all the three-velocities
of self-similar solutions are not only limited to the study of accreting BHs, but also in cosmology, supernova, and
other ﬁelds. The two-zone conﬁguration theory can explain the various states of the BHCs with changing of the
ADAF size. In the present study, we have deﬁned general self-similar solutions (power index rule, p) of the second
kind with the help of diﬀerent sized ADAFs. So, these kinds of self-similar solutions can give an easier understanding
of the two-zone radial theory, when one can reproduce results of Narayan & Yi (1995b); Esin et al.
(1997), and the
outﬂows (Narayan & Yi 1995a; Jiao & Wu 2011; Zeraatgari et al. 2018) with changing only p, which changed the
energy and transition radius of the ﬂow. This study lacks two things; First, in the sense of quantitative ways because
we have not considered explicitly relevant cooling in the ﬂuid, and we will leave it for future studies. Second, the
physics of transition from the KD to ADAF is not clear in this analytical study, but the local energy of the ADAF
is nicely matched with the local energy of the KD at the transition radius as mentioned in section 3. The aim of
present study is to investigate the power-law index for various BLs of the ADAF, distinguish the hot and cool gas at
the outer BL with nature of the general advective solutions on the basis of speciﬁc energy constant (E), and show the
variation of the advective nature in the accretion disk with ADAF self-similar solutions. The structure of this paper
is as follows: in next section 2 we talk about the ﬂuid equations and assumptions, section 3 is for analyses, section 4
shows the results, and in the last section are the summary and discussions.

3. ANALYSES

We have the energy constants of motion (equations 7, 8, and 9), which come from the ﬁrst principle with diﬀerent
assumptions in the ﬂuid equations, e.g., with and without viscosity or radiation. If we ﬁxed the energy constant of
motion then the outer BL of the transonic advective ﬂow with corresponding nature of the ﬂow is automatically ﬁxed by
satisfying accretion outer BCs (Kumar & Chattopadhyay 2013, 2014; Chattopadhyay & Kumar 2016; Kumar & Gu
2018). We have investigated the outer BLs for the hot advective ﬂows with the help of energy constant by using the
BCs of the model solutions. In other words, we have tried to connect the properties of the accreting gas at the outer
BL with the kind of the advective solutions in this section, especially, gas temperature at the outer BLs. First, we are
following the ADAFs’ outer BCs by Narayan et al. (1997) with vr ∼
vir (meaning the thermal
energy should be negligible with the local rotational, and gravitational energies), and λ = λK with assumed q−

where λ0 . λm, and λm is the Keplerian angular momentum at an marginally stable orbit. We kept λ0 in the EA
because λ0 becomes comparable to λK, when rOB is close to the BH, otherwise λ0 << λK. The ADAF solutions with
EA are also obtained in Kumar & Gu (2018). We calculated the size rOB of the ADAFs corresponding to EA for

Here Eh > 0 gives the global advective solutions with/without shock solutions, which has been investigated
2008; Kumar & Chattopadhyay 2013, 2014, 2015; Kumar et al.
in many studies (Becker et al.
2013, 2014;
Chattopadhyay & Kumar 2016).
In theoretical studies, we have found that the general advective solutions can

be represented on a E
E > 0 gives three CPs or single CP solutions, which depends on the energy and viscosity parameter of the ﬂow, and
E < 0 gives two-CPs with close topology solution (α
type) when the ﬂow is inviscid, and sub-Keplerian. For the
viscous ﬂow, E < 0 also gives open topology global solutions, like, the ADAFs (Narayan et al. 1997). Now we want to
categorize the outer BLs with a cool gas (E < 0) and hot gas (E > 0), because they both lead to diﬀerent kinds of the
accretion solutions. These BLs may depend on the properties of the accreting gases and the BH feeding mechanisms,
e.g., Roche lobe overﬂow, star wind, accretion feedback, and inter-stellar gas etc., and a optical medium depends on
the accretion rate. Moreover, the hot ﬂow transfers more angular momentum than cool ﬂow, for instance, ADAFs
(E < 0) have high λ distribution than the shocked/smooth solutions with E > 0. The accretion solutions with E > 0

have the disk aspect ratio H/r < 1 close to the BH (r . a few times a hundred), and H/r

(Lu et al. 1999; Sarkar & Das 2016). The solutions with E < 0 have the disk aspect ratio H/r < 1 throughout the
ﬂow (Narayan et al. 1997; Lu et al. 1999).

to rin (Kato et al. 2008). We now compare the energy of the diﬀerent model solutions at the BLs, Eh > EK > EA
and (EK, EA) < 0. Here, there is more chance that a high energy ﬂow can convert to low energy ﬂows with some
dissipation. Now we can predict some possibilities for the hybrid disk geometries. First, all the three ﬂows can coexist
with a possible conﬁguration, in that the outer part is the cool KD ﬂow (EK) and the inner part is the hot sub-Keplerian
ADAF (EA) around the equatorial plane (like two-zone radial geometry), and both ﬂows can be covered partially or
fully (depends on the smooth/shocked solutions and also may depend on the sources of the hot accreting gas) with hot
sub-Keplerian gas (Eh), because this ﬂow has lowest λ distribution with higher the disk thickness from the ﬂow with
EA. For instance, Kumar & Gu (2018) have found that the supersonic and subsonic regions are formed above the
equatorial plane in the inner part of some 2D disk structures, and both regions are connected with the shock like sharp
transitions but close to the equatorial plane, the ﬂow is always subsonic, before the inner CP. Second, the two ﬂows
can coexist as described in Wandel & Liang (1991), and any other ﬂow is negligible, e.g., the outer part is the cool
KD and the inner is the hot sub-Keplerian ADAF, which is referred to as the two-zone radial conﬁguration geometry
ﬂow (Esin et al. 1997), or the cool KD is covered with hot sub-Keplerian ﬂow (Eh) with extending to the BH horizon,
which is referred to as the sandwich geometry or two-component accretion ﬂow (TCAF) (Chakrabarti & Titarchuk
1995). Third, only one ﬂow can dominate and other ﬂows have a negligible existence.

λ0/(2r3

EA = [1/4rin −

Here, the outer BCs with Eh and EA give the sub-Keplerian transonic advective ﬂows, but the KD is wholly subsonic,
therefore there is an incomplete accretion solution. In order to make complete accretion for the KD onto the BHs then
the ﬂow needs to be transonic. By doing so there are two possibilities; ﬁrst, the inner part of the KD can generate tran-
sonic advective solution with the help of internal instabilities (Lightman & Eardley 1974; Meyer & Meyer-Hofmeister
1994). Second, the gas of the inner part of the KD can evaporate due to external hot source (Molteni et al. 2001),
like the hot ﬂow above the equatorial plane, if it existed. Here, we assumed that there is no suﬃcient hot source is
available, so the KD can generate transonic ADAF ﬂow with some internal processes. If we consider EK is a energy
at the inner radius of the KD and EA is a energy of the hot ﬂow then energy diﬀerence from the equations (11 and
in)1/2] > 0 at rin = rOB when λ0 < λK/2, here λK at rin. λ0 depends on the
13) is ∆E = EK −
viscosity and mass accretion rate of the ﬂow. Here, EK > EA, so there is a possibility that a part of the energy of the
KD can transfer into the advective ﬂow and generate the ADAF solution, where vr and h promptly become signiﬁcant
over rotations in the ﬂow. EA is distributed to the kinetic and thermal energy of the ﬂow as the ﬂow moves toward the
BH. Now we can write rOB = rin = rt in the rest of paper, where rt is a transition radius. Apparently, this analysis
looks almost perfect but needs further understanding of this transition process with addition of more physics. We are
hoping for more exploration of this coupling in the future. Moreover, the local energy of the KD and the ADAF is
1/4rt from Equation (10). Here, BA is a local energy of the ADAF at the
same at the rt, which is BK = BA =
outer BL, which also comes from the Equation (9), when the bulk velocity and thermal energy is negligible, meaning
vir. So this energy analysis does not need any external heating at the transition radius, which
vr ∼
is unlike to the statement of Kato & Nakamura (1998). Moreover, ADAF solutions are the only solution to have a
smooth variation from the Keplerian to sub-Keplerian λ at the transition radius, and also has cool BL. If we compare
equations (13) and (12) at rOB = rin, Eh > EK, here outer ﬂow with EK cannot transfer to transonic hot ﬂow unless
there is some external heating at rt (Molteni et al. 2001). We know that the H << r for E < 0 and H
r for E > 0
at the BL from the expression of the disc half-height, H
as/ΩK. Thus, the ADAF solutions should generate from
∼
the cool and narrow space, and which matches with the inner region of the KD. Therefore, we believed in the coupling
of the KD and the ADAF, and investigated the ADAFs with diﬀerent sizes of the disk, which will certainly help in the
understanding of the outﬂows variation with changing rt, and it will be complementary to the two-zone conﬁguration
theory (Esin et al. 1997), when one can solve the 2D disk for the study of the outﬂows, as Esin et al.
(1997) have
studied only the variation of the spectral states with changing rt.

Figure 1. Variation of the outer BLs (rOB) with E (or EA and Eh). These BLs are corresponding only to transonic solutions
with a single CP or three CPs. The 3-CPs are only found when E > 0, and an outer and inner CP is connected with shock
transitions (Kumar & Chattopadhyay 2013; Lee et al. 2016). The ﬁlled (cid:4) points are represented in table 1 in the ﬁrst and
second columns. The arrow on top of the ﬁgure represents the direction of increasing E. Θvir is the virial temperature.

In Figure 1, we plotted variations of BLs with energies of the advective ﬂows for two types of outer BCs from the
equations (11) and (12). The variation of the outer BLs with both hot and cool gases are showing opposite behavior,
with a variation of E. This means that high EA has large BL and it decreases with decreasing E in panel (a), but
in panel (b), the BL is large for low Eh, and it decreases with increasing E. Since BLs in the panel (a) are rotation
dominated and in the panel (b) are thermally dominated but both have opposite behavior in the accretion ﬂows. Means
λK is high when the BL is larger, therefore EA is high, and Θvir is high when the BL is low therefore Eh is high. Both
kinds of gases can lead to transonic global solutions with large or shorter BLs. The interesting thing is that both have
almost identical BLs, and the observed spectra of the BHXBs can be explained by the hybrid models (cool Keplerian
and hot sub-Keplerian ﬂows), which have diﬀerent λ distributions and advective nature of the ﬂow. From our previous
experince, the global shocked solutions occurred with large BL and hot gas at BLs means 0 < E . 0.007 for α = 0.01
(Kumar & Chattopadhyay 2013). And the ADAF disk solutions showed a comparatively large range of BLs and E
as shown in the table 1 and ﬁgure 1. Both the energies have large as well as shorter BLs but in physical situations the

Table 1. We mentioned the outer BLs of ADAF disk with corresponding to the energy parameters (E), and estimated p from
the velocity proﬁle of the ADAF solutions.

BLs are large of the astrophysical objects. Therefore, we believed that the inner ADAF ﬂow is originated from the
outer KD, and together make the disk larger with following the two-zone conﬁguration theory. In next section, we will
study the ADAF solutions for various outer BLs by solving ﬂuid diﬀerential equations with following (Kumar & Gu
2018), and also ﬁnd out the general self-similar solutions.

4. RESULTS

In this section, we present the transonic ADAF solutions and estimated self-similar solutions of ﬁnite size. By
using the self-similar solutions, we distinguished the advective and non-advective regions of the disk. Nonetheless,
we got very interesting results that will be worthwhile in the understanding of the variation of the spectrum and jet
states of the BHCs. This work is supporting previous studies (Meyer & Meyer-Hofmeister 1994; Narayan & Yi 1995b;
Honma 1996; Esin et al. 1997; Kato & Nakamura 1998; Gu & Lu 2000; Manmoto & Kato 2000; Meyer et al. 2000;
Gracia et al. 2003; Lu et al. 2004).

4.1. Calculation of p from ADAFs

We used ﬁve disk ﬂow parameters to investigate the transonic accretion solutions on the equatorial plane, which are
E, λ0, γ, β and α. Here, we investigated the ADAF solutions when E < 0 with following outer BCs Narayan et al.
(1997). We integrated the ﬂuid diﬀerential equations (1-4) by four-order Runge-Kutta numerical method with using
same methodology for ﬁnding ADAF solutions as described in appendices of Kumar & Gu (2018).

We represented the ADAF solutions with diﬀerent E, which gives us diﬀerent size of the ADAF ﬂow as shown in
a Figure 2. Here we plotted bulk velocity (vr, dotted red) and sound speed (as, dashed black) curves together in
a ﬁrst column of the Figure 2, and the distribution of ﬂow speciﬁc angular momentum (λ, dotted red) in a second
column with the Keplerian distribution (dashed black). We scaled all the ﬂow variables with radial power law which
are represented by long-dashed blue line in the each panel of the ﬁgure. We got almost same power law variations
for the as and λ, but diﬀerent for vr with diﬀerent BLs. The radial power law for as may vary when changing the
space-time geometry of the central object. The variation of the bulk velocity slope is obvious because the BCs of an
0) of the BH accretion are ﬁxed. Therefore, with variation of the BLs the
inner (horizon, vr →
ﬂow velocity has to manage between these two BCs with adjusting slope of the bulk velocity. The power index (p) of
the vr are represented with E corresponding their BLs in the table 1. The outer BLs of the transonic ADAFs with
corresponding E of table 1 are also represented on EA vs rOB plane with ﬁlled (cid:4) points in the Figure 1. Interestingly,
which are very well matched with directly calculated BLs from the equation (11) in the Figure 1.

so this gives a self-similar solution of ﬁrst kind (Narayan & Yi 1994). Here, (fr, fs, fφ = λ/λK)

of the ﬂow variables. The distribution of vr is much aﬀected by α, but other ﬂow variables are not changed much by it, as
seen in Narayan et al. (1997) and, more recently, Kumar & Gu (2018). Therefore, we introduced α in the expression

self-similar solutions is not a constant with the radius when p > 0.5. So, this solved the problem of constant Mach
number with self-similar ADAF solution (p = 0.5), as mentioned by (Jiao & Wu 2011; Jiao et al. 2015).

The outﬂows are very common from the hot advective disks, which has been seen in the simulations (Narayan et al.
2012; Li et al. 2013; S¸adowski et al. 2013; Bu et al. 2013, 2016,a,b; Bu & Yang 2019; Yuan et al. 2015), and the
observations (Crenshaw & Kraemer 2012; Wang et al. 2013; Park et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2019). So, we assumed
mass variation in the accretion disk due to the outﬂows and following Blandford & Begelman (1999), Equation (1)

Now we would like to analyze equation (17) and calculate the fadv with p values. First, we assumed p = 1/2

becomes hotter and radiative in-eﬃcient. So in order to balance the energy equation (4), we need the outﬂows (Gu

4.3. Calculation of advection factor and BLs of Bi-models

In Figure (3), we have shown the variation of B, E and BK with r. Here we plotted B and E corresponding to
three ADAF solutions, as shown in Figure (2), where the values of E are remain constant with the r for each accretion
solution. The outer BLs of the ADAF is represented with dotted-dashed line. The B is varying with the r and has
same value as BK at the outer BLs of the ADAF or inner BLs of the KD, when r = rt. Thus there is a possibility that
both models can be connected. Moreover, the local energy (B) of the ﬂow becomes a lowest at the BH horizon, where
B = E. So the constant of the motion of the ﬂow (E) is a lowest local energy of the ﬂow for a particular solution,
which will be swallowed by the BH in the accretion ﬂow.

We look at the basic property of the both ﬂows (ADAF and KD). The ADAF is the radiative ineﬃcient means time
scales of the radiative processes, which is much longer than the advection time but in the KD, this happens reversely,
which makes the radiative eﬃcient disk. Interestingly, the variation of p changed the bulk velocity of the ﬂow (equation
14), thus the advection time. The variation of fadv with r is presented in a Figure (4) with diﬀerent p = 1.0 (solid red),
and 1.5 (dotted black), and ﬁxed fφ = 1 and s = 0. The vertical dashed (red) lines are representing transition radius
(rt) and the ADAF size. Since the KD has mass accretion rate so the disk must have a little advection, therefore we
assumed fadv . 0.01 with fφ = 1. Thus we can safely assume that the viscous heating rate (Q+) is equal to radiative
cooling rate (Q−). In doing so, we have drawn a horizontal long-dashed (black) line in the Figure with fadv = 0.01,
which separates the advective and non-advective regions and cuts both curves at the respective rt. For a particular
curve with corresponding p, the ﬂow is advective and radiatively ineﬃcient when r < rt, and is non-advective and
radiatively eﬃcient when r > rt. For r < rt, we can also change the angular momentum distribution from Keplerian
to sub-Keplerian values, which will also increase fadv. In both curves, the advective region decreases with increasing
p but fadv arises faster and becomes higher at some location. Thus, my notion is that the outﬂow region deﬁnitely

decreased with increasing p because the ADAF size decreased, but we are not clear about a behavior of the outﬂows
strength. Nonetheless, the advective factor is increasing faster with decreasing ADAF size (Figure 4), so the outﬂow
strength may increase with advection (Jiao & Wu 2011). We will leave this issue for a future study and communicate
it as a separate paper.

In Figure 5, we have represented variations of the BLs with p. A dashed blue curve is a ﬁtting curve of the data
points of the second and third columns of the table 1, which is also a projection of EA vs rOB of the Figure 1a. This
gives us the relation between the p and the rt, so the ﬁtting formula is p = a/log(brt) + c, where a = 3.952, b = 0.4614
and c = 0.3215. This ﬁtting formula will be useful when one can study the eﬀects on the outﬂows and emitted
non-thermal radiation from the ADAFs with changing rt. A solid red curve is corresponding to the inner radius of
the non-advective ﬂows or transition radius of the two ﬂows, which is calculated from equation (17) when fadv = 0.01
with changing p. Here both curves are almost same. Hence the equation (17) is consistent with the BLs of the actual
ADAFs and transition radius with assumed fadv ≈

0.01.

5. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

This study shows two main important points of using the self-similar approach; ﬁrst, we can solve the PDEs and
study the 2D disk structure with/without the outﬂows, and second, a study of the spectral states variations of the
BHCs with the analytical approach. Although the numerical simulations better represent the ﬂuid dynamics around
the astrophysical objects, but the present study is useful in the understanding of the nature of the accretion solutions
with the diﬀerent outer BLs and outer BCs with hot or cool gases, Which will help in the studies of the accretion
dynamics with variations of the emitted radiation and the outﬂows by the simulations. Here, we investigated the self-
similar solutions of the second kind for the ADAFs, and we proposed the variations of the advective and non-advective
region by using the self-similar solutions.

In this study, we have explored transonic advective solutions with changing E < 0. Interestingly, they have the
single sonic point and easily ﬁt with a single power law of the radius for a large range of the distances (Figure 2).
Therefore, we investigated the power index of the ﬂow variable with diﬀerent BLs. These power indices of the variables
with ﬁnite BLs are identiﬁed as the self-similar solutions of the second kind (Barenblatt & Zol’dovich 1972). The

ﬁrst time, we identiﬁed this kind of solution for the ADAF disk around the BHs, as our best knowledge of this kind
of accretion study. Although, the self-similar solution of the ﬁrst kind was identiﬁed for the ADAF by Narayan & Yi
(1994). In the accretion ﬂow studies, many authors have only used the ﬁrst kind solution (p = 0.5), which gives a
constant Mach number in the accretion ﬂows but the second kind (p > 0.5) gives radially dependent Mach number
r(0.5−p)). Which is more realistic in the accretion ﬂow. We used general self-similar solutions and solved the
(M
ﬂuid diﬀerential equations and calculated the advection parameter (fadv) with the radius (Figure 4). For the ﬁrst kind
solution (p = 0.5), we get the advection parameter and the Mach number are independent of the radius, which is not
reasonable in the accretion ﬂow. Now, one can use the second kind solutions (p > 0.5) in solving ODEs or PDFs for
the accretion and outﬂows, which will give more better results, and one can also conclude that how the outﬂows are
changing with the BLs. So, this will give the better understanding of the disk structure and the outﬂow generations.
As we are interested in the two-zone conﬁguration theory of the disk, which can explain spectral states variations of
the BHCs with variations of the inner ADAF disk and the outer KD (Esin et al. 1997). Therefore, we investigated
the possible coupling of the KD and ADAFs solutions on the basis of the advective nature (Figure 4) and the energy

Analyzing power index rule for ADAFs

of the ﬂows (Figure 3). As we know, the KD was constructed with the purely algebraic equations and non-advective
in nature. Now the ADAFs also become in the algebraic in their form by obtaining the self-similar solution of ﬁnite
size boundaries (rt). So we assumed the KD is present when r > rt and interestingly, we found a very little advection
at the rt and beyond, fadv . 0.01 for any value of the p > 0.5 (Figure 4). Thus we can safely apply other assumptions
of the KD, which will give thermal BB emissivity. When r < rt is applicable for the ADAF self-similar solution of
the second kind, and one can easily use them to calculate non-thermal radiation and the outﬂows like Narayan & Yi
(1995a,b) with diﬀerent size of the ADAFs. There is one more advantage of this study for the possible coupling of the
bi-modals, we did not require any external source because BK = BA when E < 0, which is unlike to the conclusion
of the previous studies Kato & Nakamura (1998); Meyer et al. (2000); Molteni et al. (2001); Lu et al. (2004) when
E < 0. For ADAF Self-similar ﬂow when p = 0.5, we did not get the non-advective or cooling-dominated ﬂow,
and which is consistent with the conclusion of Kato & Nakamura (1998).
If we want to couple the KD with the
advective sub-Keplerian ﬂow from E > 0 then we need an external hot source to evaporate the inner part of the KD
(Kato & Nakamura 1998; Molteni et al. 2001), because Eh > EK.

Moreover, we have also predicted the diﬀerent kinds of the hybrid disk geometries for the accretion ﬂows depending
on the temperature of the accreting gases at the BL. For instance, when the gas comes from large radii in two-phases
(cold clumps embedded in hot diluted gas). In this case, the hybrid disk can be formed depending on the accretion
rates. Here we considered the hot accretion rate (E > 0) and cool accretion rate (E < 0). As the hot gas is very
eﬃcient in the angular momentum transportation at the large radii when the gas is captured by the disk. Therefore,
the hot gas becomes quickly advective and can generate the smooth solution with single CP or the shocked solution
with multiple CPs (Kumar & Chattopadhyay 2013, 2014; Chattopadhyay & Kumar 2016). On the other hand, the
cold gas can settle in the form of the KD or the ADAF disk or both ﬂows (the hybrid disk) around the equatorial plane
with depending on the cool mode accretion rate (Esin et al. 1997). So, the maximum three kinds of the ﬂow can
coexist in the hybrid disk depending on the hot and cool accretion rates, and the viscosity. If the ﬂow components are
less than three then other ﬂow(s) is/are negligible, which may conﬁgure as the two-zone radial ﬂow geometry (inner
hot ADAF and outer the KD) or like sandwich geometry (one ﬂow or two-zone radial ﬂows around the equatorial
plane, covered with the other hotter shocked/smooth ﬂow). These kinds of geometries, with at least one hot ﬂow, can
help in the explanation of the outﬂows and emission of the very high energy photons due to the inverse comptonization
of the soft photons of the KD with the hot post-shock region or inner part of the smooth advective ﬂow.

The timing and quantitative analysis of the BH feeding mechanisms with the variation of the spectral states, and
the nature of the accreting gas sources are needed to explore more by the observational and theoretical studies. Since
the ﬂow with the cool gas (E < 0) and the hot gas (E > 0) at the outer BLs generate diﬀerent kinds of the accretion
solutions and λ distributions. These two points can help in the understanding of all the observed properties of the
BHCs with changing the mass accretion rate and the viscosity. The ﬁnal conclusion of our study is that the both kind
of the BLs (hot E > 0, and cool E < 0) may depend on the BH feeding mechanisms and the nature of the accreting
gas sources (hot or cool). So, the qualitative and quantitative studies of the BH feeding mechanisms can help in the
understanding of the BH accretion physics.
