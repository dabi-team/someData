Abstract 

Terahertz  spectrum  is  being  researched  upon  to  provide  ultra-high  throughput  radio  links  for  indoor  applications  e.g. 
virtual reality (VR), etc. as well as outdoor applications e.g. backhaul links, etc. This paper investigates a monopulse-
based beam tracking approach for limited mobility users relying on sparse massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) 
wireless channels. Owing to the sparsity, beamforming is realized using digitally-controlled radio frequency (RF) / inter-
mediate-frequency (IF) phase shifters with constant amplitude constraint for transmit power compliance. A monopulse-
based beam tracking technique, using received signal strength indication (RSSI) is adopted to avoid feedback overheads 
for obvious reasons of efficacy and resource savings. The Matlab implementation of the beam tracking algorithm is also 
reported. This Matlab implementation has been kept as general purpose as possible using functions wherein the channel, 
beamforming codebooks, monopulse comparator, etc. can easily be updated for specific requirements and with minimum 
code amendments.

Introduction 

Terahertz spectrum (0.1 to 10 THz) provides unal-
located large bandwidths needed for ultra-high data rate ra-
dio  links  for  indoor  applications  such  as  virtual  reality 
(VR)  /  augmented  reality  (AR)  [1],  [2],  [3].  Such  high 
throughput  wireless  communications  enable  the  users  to 
enjoy VR/AR experiences without the need to carry heavy 
backpacks [4], [5] and tethered connections.  

As the wavelengths are very small, large number of 
antenna elements can be packed in small form-factors, both 
at indoor access points (APs) and users’ headsets. It is in-
dispensable to employ beamforming techniques to realize 
high gain, narrow beams for communications to be possi-
ble despite the large free-space path-loss (FSPL) and raised 
noised floor due to high carrier frequency and huge band-
widths,  respectively.  Despite  the  potential  of  very  high 
MIMO  dimensions,  only  a  few  multi-path  components 
(MPCs) actually exist from the transmitter (Tx) to the re-
ceiver (Rx) due to electromagnetic propagation conditions 
at such high frequencies e.g. high atmospheric attenuation, 
indoor  foliage  losses,  etc.  This  sparsity  of  THz  MIMO 
channels is easily evident in beamspace [6], [7], [8].  

Such  sparse  MIMO  channels  are  more  easily  and 
more efficiently learnt in beamspace than in the spatial sig-
nal space. Exhaustive beam search and hierarchical beam 
search  are  the  state-of-the-art  beam  training  /  channel 
learning / channel estimation techniques for learning sparse 

MIMO  channels  in  beamspace  [9],  [10].  However,  beam 
search  processes  have  significant  overheads  and  losses 
[11], [12] which can be avoided and instead used for pay-
load  data  communications,  if  the  need  for  beam  search 
could be minimized. It is thus imperative to track the user 
by  applying  beam  tracking  algorithms.  With  effective 
beam tracking, beam search can be circumvented as long 
as the track is not lost due to unforeseen / random reasons. 
There are various ways of tracking users e.g. Kalman filter 
based  tracking,  etc.  Such  techniques  need  feedback  i.e. 
noisy observations / estimates from the user for tracking. It 
is desirable not to employ feedback-based tracking for ob-
vious reasons of effectiveness and resource savings.  

We  opt  for  Monopulse-based  beam  tracking  as  is 
used for sensing applications such as radars, optical track-
ers,  etc.  [13].  This  manuscript  reports  monopulse-based 
beam tracking for indoor VR applications with sparse mas-
sive  MIMO  channels.  A  Matlab  implementation  is  also 
presented and confirms the effectiveness of the proposed 
approach.  The  Matlab  implementation  has  been  kept  as 
general  purpose  as  possible  using  functions  wherein  the 
channel, beamforming codebooks, monopulse comparator, 
etc.  can  easily  be  updated  for  specific  requirements  with 
minimum code amendments. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 specifies the system model / specifications and track-
ing requirements, Section 3 provides a brief of monopulse 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
principle, Section 4 presents the design and Matlab imple-
mentation of monopulse-based beam tracking, and Section 
5 summarizes and concludes the paper.  

2  Tracking Requirement 

Specifications  

In  VR/AR  scenarios,  users  have  limited  mobility 
with maximum speed of 4 kilometers per hour (km/h). The 
typical electronic RF beam switching takes about nanosec-
onds (ns) which is orders of magnitude faster than the user 
speed.  VR/AR  users  move  inside  the  VR/AR  room  on  a 
plane  surface. For the sake of simplicity and  without the 
loss  of  generality,  we  consider  the  uniform  linear  array 
(ULA)  implementation.  The  angular  tracking  is  needed 
only in the one dimensional azimuthal axis parallel to the 
ULA  as  the  beam  selections  remain  the  same  for  user 
movement along the orthogonal dimension / direction / axis 
in the azimuthal plane. 

Current  channel  parameters  i.e.  angle  of  arrival 
(AoA), angle of departure (AoD), and channel gain are the 
inputs to the beam tracking process coming from the results 
of beam search operation. The MIMO channel can be spec-
ified by AoA, AoD, and channel gain [6], [chapters 7, 8 of 
[14]].  

For  minimal  spatial  inter-beam  correlation  /  inter-
beam leakage / inter-beam coupling, orthogonal / unitary / 
Butler  matrix  /  discrete  Fourier  transform  (DFT)  beam-
forming codebooks are used at the transmitter and the re-
ceiver  [section  3.10  of  [15]].  For  an  N  element  ULA,  N 
orthogonal beams can be created which divide the beam-
forming  space  in  N  angular  sectors  corresponding  to  the 
half power beam widths (HPBWs) in u-space where u = sin 
(ɵ), ‘ɵ’ being the angle measured from the ULA broadside. 
The beamforming space is ‘ɵ’ from - 𝜋  to + 𝜋 radians. As 
seen in Figure 1, for orthogonal / DFT / unitary beamform-
ing codebooks, at the peak or main response axis (MRA) 
of one beam all other beams have their nulls i.e. they do 
not  receive  or  transmit  any  energy  in  that  direction.  The 
orthogonal beamforming codebook for N=8 element ULA 
is given in Table 1. For example, the first, fifth, and seventh 
columns are the beamforming vectors for MRAs at -90, 0, 
and 48.59 degrees, respectively, measured from the ULA 
broadside.  The  magnitudes  of  the  beamforming  weights 
are  constant  and  equal  to  unity  for  compliance  with  the 
transmit power constraint. However, different beamform-
ing weights have different phase-shifts. These phase-shifts 
are  implemented  using  digitally-controlled  RF/IF  phase-
shifters to dispense with power-hungry RF chains (RFCs) 
which would have been needed for the digital / baseband 
implementation of such beamforming weights. Typically, 
3 to 4 control bits are used to set the phase-shift values of 
the RF/IF phase shifters. DFT codebooks correspond to the 
left and right unitary matrices obtained after singular value 
decomposition  (SVD)  of  a  MIMO  channel  matrix.  Thus, 
they are optimum in communication theoretic sense [chap-
ter 7 of [14]].

3  Monopulse preliminaries 

In amplitude comparison monopulse angular track-
ing [13], RSSI derived from the received electromagnetic 
(EM) energy / radiation is used to track the object of inter-
est. A multi-lobe antenna is used as the primary sensor to 
generate the error signal proportional to the angular offset 
of the target from the boresight of the antenna. As seen in 
Figure  2,  two  receive  lobes  squinted  at  half  power  beam 
width (HPBW) from the antenna boresight are created. The 
object of interest is assumed to be at the antenna boresight 
at the beginning of beam tracking. Antenna boresight is de-
noted as ‘B’. If the actual AoA is on the right of ‘B’ e.g. 
axis marked as ‘R’, then the right lobe will capture more 
received EM energy as compared to the left lobe yielding 
a positive error signal at the  output.  On the  contrary, for 
left AoA e.g. ‘L’, the left lobe will collect more received 
EM energy than the right lobe giving a negative error signal 
at the output. This error signal can be used for the angular 
/  beam  tracking  of  a  user. The  AP  receives  radio  signals 
from VR / AR users during handshaking / acknowledgment 
phases of the data communication. Thus, no extra radio re-
ception / feedback is needed for error generation.

Figure 2. Illustration of monopulse error signal generation 

With reference to Figure 2, the error signal magni-
tude indicates the amount of angular offset. The larger the 
angular offset, the larger the error signal. The sign of the 
error i.e. +ve or –ve can be used to determine whether the 
user  is  on  the  right  or  the  left  side  of  the  antenna  array 
boresight. 

Based  on  the  monopulse  error  signal,  the  RF/IF 
beamforming  phase-shift  values  are  set  for  next  possible 
right or left beam MRA for positive or negative monopulse 
error  signal,  respectively.  The  error  is  tested  iteratively 
which  should  go  down  to  almost  zero,  within  computa-
tional thresholds, if the new beam MRA matches with the 
AoA; else the beamforming phase-shift values are updated 
again to reduce the error. 

As seen in equation (1), due to sin of cos of ‘ɵ’ and 
cos  of  sin  of  ‘ɵ’  terms,  the  beamwidth  increases  as  the 
beam is steered away on either side of the ULA boresight. 
The exponential term on the left hand side is the expression 
for beamforming weight or phase shift terms in the array 
manifold vector / steering vector for a ULA [sections 2.2, 
2.3  of  [15]]  assuming  narrowband  signals.  To  overcome 
this issue, we use the HPBWs in u-space to derive the value 
of left and right beam squints because in u-space the beam-
width remains constant even with steering [chapters 2, 3 of 
[15]], where 𝑢 =   sin 𝜃. As evident in equation (2), in u-
space, the beamwidth remains constant across the scanning 
space. 𝑑 is the ULA inter-element spacing and 𝜆 is the car-
rier wavelength. 

In  case  of  broadband  signals,  they  can  be  broken 
down in the frequency domain into smaller bandwidth sub-
channels  by  using  DFT  /  orthogonal  frequency  domain 
multiplexing (OFDM) [sections 3.4.4 and 4.4 of [14]]. 

Our Matlab codes implement the following: 

1.  DFT  beamforming  codebooks  are  created  for 

Tx & Rx ULAs 

2.  Beam search o/p is passed as i/p for beam track-

ing 

3.  MIMO  channel  matrix  is  created  based  on 

AoA, AoD, and channel gain 
4.  Monopulse error is calculated 
5.  Next left / right beam is selected 
6.  Steps 4 & 5 are iterated 

4  Conclusions 

THz RF/IF beam tracking requirements specific for 
indoor  VR/AR  applications  have  been 
identified. 
Monopulse-based  beam  tracking  has  been  implemented 
with discrete beam MRAs. This method provides  a mini-
mum overhead solution as it does not need feedback. For 
systems with more than two RFCs,  monopulse-based ap-
proach has lower overhead than sequential lobing and with-
out  any  extra  hardware  requirement.  The  error  signal  re-
duces progressively to zero in a few iterations and the beam 
track is maintained consistently. As long as the AoA does 
not change i.e. the user does not move, the same beam is 
retained i.e. no steering takes place.  

The Matlab codes have used ideal phase-shift val-
ues  in  DFT  codebooks.  In  practice,  only  discrete  phase-
shift  values  will  be  available  with  digitally-controlled

tized phase values is an interesting future work with prac-
tical relevance.
