We treat the problem of particle pushing by growing ice as a free diﬀusion near a wall that moves
with discrete steps. When the particle diﬀuse away from the surface the surface can grow, blocking
the particle from going back. Elementary calculations of the model reproduce established results
for the critical velocity vc for particle engulfment: vc~ 1/r for large particles and vc~Const for small
particles, r being the particle’s radius. Using our model we calculate the dragging distance of the
particle by treating the pushing as a sequence of growing steps by the surface, each enabled by the
particle’s diﬀusion away. Eventually the particle is engulfed by ice growing around it when a rare
event of long diﬀusion time away from the surface occurs. By calculating numerically the statistics of
the diﬀusion times from the surface and therefore the probability for a such a rare event we calculate
the total dragging time and distance L of the particle by the ice front to be L~ exp[1/(v(cid:5)r )] where v is
the freezing velocity. This relation for L is conﬁrmed by ours and others experiments. The distance
L provides a length scale for pattern formation during phase transition in colloidal suspensions,
such as ice lenses and lamellae structures by freeze casting. Data from the literature for ice lenses
thickness and lamellae spacing during freeze casting agree with our prediction for the relation of the
distance L. These results lead us to conjecture that lamellae formation is dominated by their lateral
growth which pushes and concentrates the particles between them.

INTRODUCTION

When a moving solidiﬁcation front encounters a for-
eign particle in the melt, it can either engulf it or push
and reject it [1, 2]. The outcome of this interaction is
fundamental in crystal growth of single crystals [3, 4],
soil freezing [5], alloy casting [6] and freeze casting [7–9].
Ice can only grow when there is water on its surface
which then freeze. Having a particle on its surface con-
tradict this basic condition, there are no water on the ice
surface where the particle is and ice can not grow there.
The particle must be displaced from the surface so its
place on the ice surface would be replaced by water in
order for the ice to grow (ﬁg 1a). It is this mechanism of
moving the particle from the surface of ice that is in the
heart of the phenomenon of ice-particle interaction.

For high front velocity and large particle size the parti-
cle will be engulfed, as oppose to slow velocity and small
particle for which the particle can be pushed by the ad-
vancing crystallization front. For a given particle size
there exist a critical velocity v c that separates the two
regimes.

Current models of this phenomenon rely on an actual
force between the particle and the ice surface which repels
the particle. We name these models as force balance
models. Our model relies on the particle being free to
diﬀuse and no speciﬁc forces between the particle and
the surface are involved.

In the literature the interaction of ice surface and a

∗ michael.chasnitsky@mail.huji.ac.il

particle is modeled by a “Force Balance Model”. In this
model it is agreed that there is a repelling force Fσv be-
tween the ice surface and the particle which pushes the
particle ahead of the moving front [2]. The pushing force
is calculated from Van der Waals interactions and inter-
face shape changes [2]. This pushing force is balanced
by a drag force Fd that pulls the particle toward the so-
lidiﬁcation front [10]. A steady state of constant velocity
particle pushing is than reached when the forces are equal
Fd = Fσ. From this condition the critical velocity can be
estimated to scale as [11]

vc ∼ 1
ηr

(1)

where r is the particle radius and η is the viscosity
of the liquid. Equation 1 is the widely accepted, experi-
mentally veriﬁed and intuitive expression for the critical
velocity v c[1, 2, 7, 12]. We’ve omitted here the terms
with the ﬁlm thickness and the surface energies because
as we claim that the particle pushing is secondary to a
dominant phenomenon of the Brownian ratchet mecha-
nism described below, also they are almost inaccessible
experimentally.

THE BROWNIAN RATCHET MODEL

Outline of the Model

We treat the particle as free to diﬀuse and to per-
form Brownian motion in water near the ice surface. We
approximate ice as a wall that the particle can not pen-
etrate. As long as the particle is close to the ice surface,

ice does not grow. Only when the particle is separated at
least a distance δ from the surface can the ice grow and
than the particle is again on the surface (ﬁg 1). There
is no treatment in the literature of the case of Brownian
motion near ice surface. We justify the model’s validity
and assumptions in a later section.

The Critical Velocity

Now that we have formulated our model, we can cal-
culate the velocity of the particle motion according to
the Brownian ratchet model by Peskin, Odell, and Oster
[13]. The time to diﬀuse a distance δ is denoted as T δ.
A freely diﬀusing particle travels a distance delta on av-
erage over time τδ ≡ δ
2D . For the most simple estimation
[14] Tδ = τδ. After diﬀusing length δ, another ice layer is
added to the the ice front which means the particle can
not go back. Diﬀusing a larger distance L = N δ increases
the time linearly with N TL = N Tδ as appose to N 2 for
regular diﬀusion. The average speed of the particle is
than

which is perfect ratchet velocity [13]. This would be the
speed if the particle would diﬀuse and ice would grow in-
stantaneously after it. Taking the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
from Einstein-Stokes [15] relation with a correction ξ
[16, 17] for near wall diﬀusion Dparticle(r) = ξkT

inserting it into eq. 2 we get the critical velocity for en-

which recovers relation (eq. 1) which is well established
and agrees with the previous models. The derivation
of the expression for v c in eq. 3 is valid only for slow
ice growth velocities because than the assumption of in-
stantaneous ice growth is not limited kinetically, i.e. the
time δ
v for ice to grow a distance δ is much longer than
δ
V0 which is the fastest ice can grow planar under spe-
ciﬁc conditions. Therefore, our model is applicable for
ice growth velocity v ≪ V0 and therefore for large par-
ticles r ≫ r0 (ﬁg 2). Maximum planar growth velocity
of ice is estimated under typical conditions to V0 ∼ 5 µm

(4)

The distance δ is expected to be on the scale of the
size of an ice layer which is ~0.5 nm. It is seen that for
small particles the limiting factor in the critical velocity
for pushing the particle is the growth of ice. Therefore
the critical velocity does not depend on the particle size
for small particles (ﬁg 2)

vc(r < 10 µm) ∼

= V0

(5)

This independence of the critical velocity on the particle
size was observed by Uhlmann, Chalmers, and Jackson
[1] in one of the ﬁrst papers in the ﬁeld. Rempel and
Worster [19] explained such a behavior by the increased
surface curvature of the ice surface near the particle for
small particles. In our model this behavior follows natu-
rally from the model. This model has another interesting
consequence. In the regime where the critical velocity is
constant (eq. 5), V0 is the maximum velocity ice can
grow while staying planar on a very small scale. This

 
is a parameter that is hard to measure optically (resolu-
tion limit) and to the best of our knowledge was never
measured.

Aﬀect Of The Temperature Gradient And The Parti-
cle Material Higher gradient stabilizes the surface [20],
so we expect for higher gradient the velocity V0 will be
higher. Also the thermal gradient G and the thermal con-
ductivities of the liquid, crystal and particle κL, κC, κP
respectively are expected to aﬀect δ = δ(G, κL, κC, κP ) .
[21, 22]

DRAGGING TIME/DISTANCE OF THE
PARTICLE BY THE ICE FRONT

In freezing colloidal suspensions the particles are
pushed by the freezing front, concentrated and patterns
appear. The scaling of this pattern is important in freeze
casting, inclusions in steel [23] and for ice lenses forma-
tion.

Pushing of the particle by ice front is limited in time
(and in distance). After being pushed by the ice for a
time t (or a distance L=vÂ·t ), the particle is being en-
gulfed. The dragging of the particle is viewed here as a
sequence of growing steps by ice {T i
δ} (ﬁg 1b), each one
enabled by the diﬀusion away of the particle to distance
δ. This pushing of the particle is stopped once an event
occurs that diﬀusing a δ takes time T critical
v and
the particle is engulfed. The total time of the particle
dragging is

gin (supplementary). The resulting distribution n(Tδ) of
the times the particle reaches a distance δ from the origin

, with A ∼ 5 − 15 being an empiric parameter.

This relation is veriﬁed in experiments where a single
particle is dragged by a growing ice surface with con-
stant velocity (ﬁg 4a). Our data and data from Dedovets,
Monteux, and Deville [24] both agree with equation 13.

Multi particle systems

This model explains the interaction between a single
particle and the interface of ice-water. Most interesting

 
 
phenomenon relying on this interaction are in systems
with multiple particles interacting with the ice surface,
such as ice lens formation [5] and freeze casting [8]. In
such systems the mutual diﬀusion coeﬃcient is given by
[25] D(φ) = D0 ˆD(φ) where D0 is the Einstein-Stokes dif-
fusion coeﬃcient and ˆD(φ) is a correction which depends
on the concentration φ. Adjusting the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient is the simplest correction to the model to account
for the multi-particle system. Instead of inserting ˆD(φ)
as another parameter to equations 11 and 12 the deﬁni-
tion of ξ can be altered, so it would be the correction to
diﬀusion which takes particle concentration into account.
Under this adjustment the particle dragging distances of
multi-particle system should be qualitatively the same as
for single particle interacting with the ice front. In ﬁgure
4 (b-d) the spacing in the resulting structure from col-
loidal solution is plotted. The scaling L ∼ exp( 1
v·r ) (eq.
12) which was derived for single particle dragging is valid
for multi-particle systems such as ice lenses growth (ﬁg.
4b) and for lamellae spacing (ﬁg. 4c).

Lamellae spacing

The scaling of the lamellae spacing (ﬁg. 4c, 4d and sup-
plementary) also obeys the relation L ∼ exp( 1
v ). This is
a surprising result, especially since the agreement is so
good. We interpret that as that the formation of the
spacing between lamellae is determined by the distance
the particles can be pushed between the lamellae. Lat-
eral (with respect to freezing direction) pushing of the
particles between the lamellae concentrates the solution.

Justiﬁcation of the model validity and assumptions

Diﬀusion near a wall is highly damped [16] due to the
friction (no-slip boundary condition) of the liquid near
the wall. The damping scales as r
d depends on the thick-
ness d of the liquid layer between the particle and the
wall. [1, 10] This dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
∂D
∂z > 0 on the distance from the surface z results in drift
away from the surface [29–31]. In our model we assume
the distance between the particle and the ice surface is
roughly on the molecular scale and the variation in D can
be neglected, so D is assumed to be independent of z.

According to hydrodynamic calculations [10, 16] the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient of a particle near the ice surface
should vanish. Our model deals with distances between
the particle and the surface of ice being on the molecular
level, it is unclear whether the hydrodynamic approach
is valid in this limit. The thing to notice is that when
the particle ﬂuctuates away from the surface under pres-
sure is created between the particle and the surface which
must be ﬁlled with water molecules at the same rate that
ice grows. The water molecules can be supplied there by
surface diﬀusion or by lubrication ﬂow [10] on the inter-
face between ice and the particle. The thickness of the

considered to be from a molecular size [1] up to 10 nm
[10]. In both cases, for both thicknesses it was consid-
ered that water can ﬁll the gap between the particle and
the ice suﬃciently fast so ice could grow in microns per
second.

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

The Brownian ratchet explains the mechanism behind
the particle pushing by the ice surface. We show here
a mechanical model of how ice is pushing particles.
Using the model we have derived a relation between the
distance of the particle pushing and the particle size and
freezing velocity L ∼ exp( 1
v·r ) (eq. 12). We showed that
this scaling can be also used to estimate length scales
in patterns resulting from ice freezing and phase tran-
sition in general of colloidal solutions. Using the data
fromWaschkies, Oberacker, and Hoﬀmann [26] we saw
that the lamellae spacing scales in the same way, which
leads us to conjecture that lamellae formation is driven
by the pushing of particles and not the surface instabil-
ities on ice [20]. We conjecture that the instability on
the ice surface grows ahead and starts to deform, loosing
memory of its initial structure and consequently a cellu-
lar structure emerges by pushing the particles laterally
between the cells.

It would be very interesting to see under which other
conditions, such as diﬀerent particle concentrations in
multi particle systems, gravity and liquid ﬂow relation
12 is still valid. Obviously modiﬁcations to the model
would be necessary to properly describe and to account

for these conditions. This model provides a simple frame-
work which can be further developed to describe solution
freezing.

This model and this approach should be interesting
for the problem of membrane rupturing and consequently
cell and tissue damaging by growing ice. There ice grows
until it approaches the membrane. Then ice can no longer
grow since there are no water available for freezing be-
tween the ice and the membrane and we might naively
think that the cell is saved at this point. However, experi-
ments show that ice can grow into cells and rupture mem-
branes under these conditions [32]. A similar model to
ours may be proposed where the thermal ﬂuctuations of
the membrane play the same role as the particle’s Brow-
nian motion in our model. The membrane ﬂuctuations
create a separation between the membrane and the ice
surface to allow ice to grow toward the membrane. Once
ice grows the membrane can return to its initial state and
with each such cycle it has a strain and tension build up
that eventually cause the membrane to rapture resulting
in a catastrophe for the cell.
