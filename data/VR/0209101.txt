Abstract –

In this paper we set forth new exact analytical Superluminal localized

solutions to the wave equation for arbitrary frequencies and adjustable bandwidth. The

formulation presented here is rather simple, and its results can be expressed in terms of

the ordinary, so-called “X-shaped waves”. Moeover, by the present formalism we obtain

the ﬁrst analytical localized Superluminal approximate solutions which represent beams

propagating in dispersive media. Our solutions may ﬁnd application in diﬀerent ﬁelds,

like optics, microwaves, radio waves, and so on.

1. – Introduction

For many years it has been known that localized (non-dispersive) solutions exist

to the (homogeneous) wave equation[1,2,3], endowed with subluminal or Superlumi-

nal[4,5,6,7,8,9] velocities. These solutions propagate without distortion for long distances

in vacuum.

Particular attention has been paid to the localized Superluminal solutions like the

so-called X-waves[5,6,8] and their ﬁnite energy generalizations[7,8]. It is well known that

such Superluminal Localized Solutions (SLS) have been experimentally produced in acous-

tics[10], optics[11] and more recently microwave physics[12].

As is well known, the standard X-wave has a broad band frequency spectrum, starting

from zero[8,9] (it being therefore appropriate for low frequency applications). This fact

can be viewed as a problem, because it is diﬃcult or even impossible to deﬁne a carrier

frequency for that solution, as well as to use it in high frequency applications.

Therefore, it would be very interesting to obtain exact SLSs to the wave equations

with spectra localized at higher (arbitrary) frequencies and with an adjustable bandwidth

(in other words, with a well deﬁned carrier frequency).

To the best of our knowledge, only two attempts were made in this direction: one by

Zamboni-Rached et al.[8], and the other by Saari[13]. The former showed how to shift

the spectrum to higher frequencies without dealing with its bandwidth, while the latter

worked out an analytical approximation to optical pulses only.

In this work we are presenting analytical and exact Superluminal localized solutions

in vacuum, whose spectra can be localized inside any range of frequency with adjustable

bandwidths, and therefore with the possibility of choosing a well deﬁned carrier frequency.

In this way, we can get (without any approximation) radio, microwave, optical, etc.,

localized Superluminal waves.

Taking advantage of our methodology, we obtain the ﬁrst analytical approximations

to the SLS’s in dispersive media (i.e., in media with a frequency dependent refractive

index).

One of the interesting points of this work, let us stress, is that all results are obtained

from simple mathematical operations on the standard “X-wave”.

2. – Superluminal localized waves in dispersionless media

Let us start by dealing with SLSs in dispersionless media. From the axially symmetric

solution to the wave equation in vacuum (n = 1), in cylindrical coordinates, one can easily

ﬁnd that

with the conditions

ψ(ρ, z, t) = J0(kρρ) e+ikzz e−iωt

k2
ρ =

ω2
c2 − k2
z ;

k2
ρ ≥ 0 ,

(1)

(2)

where J0 is the zeroth-order ordinary Bessel function; kz and kρ are the axial and the
transverse wavenumber respectively, ω is the angular frequency and c is the light velocity.

It is essential to call attention right now to the dispersion relation (2). Positive
(but not constant, a priori) values of k2
ρ, with real kz, do allow both subluminal and
Superluminal solutions, while implying truly propagating waves only (with exclusion of

the evanescent ones). We shall pay attention in this paper to the Superluminal solutions.

Conditions (2) correspond in the (ω, kz) plane to conﬁning ourselves to the sector shown
in Fig.1; that is, to the region delimited by the straight lines ω = ±ckz.

Important consequences can be inferred from (2), when performing the coordinate

transformation

which yields

ω = ω
kz = (ω/c) cos θ ,

(

kρ = (ω/c) sin θ .

(3)

(4)

With this transformation, solution (1) can be rewritten, in the new coordinates (ω,θ),

as

ψ(ρ, ζ) = J0(

ω
c

ρ sin θ) e+iωζ cos θ

,

(5)

where ζ ≡ z − V t, and where the propagation speed (group velocity) is obviously V =

c/ cos θ. Equation (5) states that the beam is transversally localized in energy, and

propagates without suﬀering any dispersion. It should be noticed also the relationship

between V and θ: namely, each value of θ yields a diﬀerent wave velocity. This fact will

be used in the next Section.

Equation (5) represents the well known “Bessel beam”. As can be seen, such an

equation has two free parameters, ω and θ. Considering θ constant, and making a su-

perposition of waves for diﬀerent frequencies, one can obtain localized (non-dispersive),

Superluminal solutions; namely

This solution is a wave that propagates in free space without distortion and with the

Superluminal velocity V = 1/ cos θ. Because of its non-dispersive properties, and its low

frequency spectrum, the X-wave is being particularly applied in ﬁelds like acoustics[5].
The illustration of an X-wave, with parameters a = 10−7 s and V = 5 c, is shown in Fig.2.

3. – Superluminal localized waves for arbitrary frequencies and
adjustable bandwidths

In the last Section, it has been shown that a superposition of Bessel beams can be

used to obtain a localized and Superluminal solution to the wave equation in a disper-

sionless medium. It is known that it may be a diﬃcult task, it being possible, or not,

ﬁnding analytical expressions for eq.(6). Its numerical solutions usually brings in some

∗It is easy to see that this spectrum starts from zero, it being suitable for low frequency applications,

and has the bandwidth ∆ω = 1/a

4

inconveniences for further analysis, uncertainties concerning the fast oscillating ﬁeld com-

ponents, etc.; besides implying a loss in the physical interpretation of the results. Thus,

it is always worth looking for analytical expressions.

Actually, the kind of solution found by us for eq.(6) is strictly related to the chosen

spectrum S(ω). Following previous work of ours[8], we are going to present our spectrum

together with its main characteristics.

3.1 – The S(ω) spectrum

One of our main objectives is ﬁnding out a spectrum which can preserve the integra-

bility of eq.(6) for any frequency range. In order to be able to shift our spectrum towards

the desired frequency, let us locate it around a central frequency, ωc, with an arbitrary
bandwidth ∆ω.

Then, let us choose the spectrum

m

ω
V (cid:19)

S(ω) =

e−aω

(8)

(cid:18)
where V is the wave velocity, while m and a are free parameters. For m = 0, it is

S(ω) = exp[−aω], and one gets the (standard) X-wave spectrum.

After some mathematical manipulations, one can easily ﬁnd the following relations,

valid for m 6= 0:

m =

1
(∆ω±/ωc) − ln (1 + (∆ω±/ωc))

ωc =

m
a

.

(8.1)

(8.2)

Here, because of the non-symmetric character of spectrum (8), let us call ∆ω+ (> 0)
the bandwidth to the right, and ∆ω− (< 0) the bandwidth to the left of ωc; so that
It should be noted however that, already for small values of m
∆ω = ∆ω+ − ∆ω−.
(typically, for m ≥ 10), one has ∆ω+ ≈ −∆ω−. Once deﬁned ωc and ∆ω, one can
determine m from the ﬁrst equation. Then, using the second one, a is found.

Figure 3 illustrates the behavior of relation (8.1). From this ﬁgure, one can observe

that the smaller ∆ω/ωc is, the higher m must be. Thus, one can notice that m plays the

5

fundamental role of controlling the spectrum bandwidth.

From the X-wave spectrum, it is known that a is related to the (negative) slope of

the spectrum. Contrarily to a, quantity m has the eﬀect of rising the spectrum. In this

way, one parameter compensates for the other, producing the localization of the spectrum

inside a certain frequency range. At the same time, this fact also explains (because of

relation (8.2)) why an increase of both m and a is necessary to keep the same ωc. This
can be seen from Fig.4.

In Fig.4, both spectra have the same ωc. Taking the narrow spectrum as a reference,
one can observe that, to get such a result, both quantities m and a have to increase.

Moreover, this ﬁgure shows the important role of m for generating a wider, or narrower,

spectrum.

3.2 – X-type waves in a dispersionless medium

To illustrate the use of the proposed solutions, let us deﬁne the ordinary X-wave, by

rewriting eq.(6) with S(ω) = exp[−aω]:

Ψ(ρ, ζ) =

where n0 is the refractive index of the medium underlying these considerations. Applying
our spectrum expressed by eq.(8), equation (6) can be rewritten as

We have therefore seen that the use of a spectrum like (8) allows shifting it towards

any frequency and conﬁning it within the desired frequency range. In fact, this is one of

its most important characteristics.

It can be seen that eqs.(9) and (10) are equivalent. Deriving eq.(9) with respect
V ) is each time produced (an obvious property of

to (aV − iζ), a multiplicative factor ( ω
Laplace transforms). In this way, it is possible to write eq.(11) as :

Ψ(ρ, ζ) = (−1)m

∂m X
∂(aV − iζ)m .

(12)

A diﬀerent expression for eq.(11), without any need of calculating the m-th derivative

of the X-wave, can be found by using identity (6.621) of ref.[14]:

Ψ(ρ, ζ) =

(12′)

where X is the ordinary X-wave given in eq.(10), and F is a Gauss’ hypergeometric

function. Equation (12’) can be useful in the cases of large values of m.

Let us call attention to equations (12) and (12’): to our knowledge,† no analytical
expression had been previously met for X-type waves, which can be localized in the neigh-

bourhood of any chosen frequency with an adjustable bandwidth. Equations (12) allow

getting one or more of them in a simple way: All that has to be done is calculating the

m-th derivative of X with respect to (aV − iζ). Alternatively, one can have recourse to

eq.(12’).

Fig.5 shows an example of an X-shaped wave for microwave frequencies. To that
aim, it was chosen ωc = 6 × 109 GHz and ∆ω = 0.9 ωc, and the values of n and a were
calculated by using eqs.(8.1) and (8.2): thus obtaining m = 10 and a = 1.6667 × 10−9.
As one can see, the resulting wave has really the same shape and the same properties as

the classical X-waves: namely, both a longitudinal and a transverse localization.

†It can be noticed that ∂X/∂(aV − iζ) = (iV )−1∂X/∂t. Time derivatives of the X-wave have been
actually considered by J.Fagerholm et al.[15]: however the properties of the spectrum generating those
solutions (like its shifting in frequency and its bandwidth) did not ﬁnd room in that previous work.

7

 
4. – Superluminal localized waves in dispersive media

We shall now pass to dealing with dispersive media.

In Section (2), equations (3) and (4) were written for a dispersionless medium

(n0 = constant, independent of the frequency). However, for a typical medium, when
the refractive index depends on the wave frequency, n(ω), those equations become[13]

kρ(ω) = ω

c n(ω) sin(θ)




kz(ω) = ω

c n(ω) cos(θ) .

(13)

The above equations describe one of the basic points of this work. In Section (2) it



was mentioned that θ determines the wave velocity: a fact that can be exploited when one

looks for a localized wave that does not suﬀer dispersion. In other words, one can choose

a particular frequency dependence of θ to compensate for the (geometrical) dispersion

due to the variation with the frequency of the refractive index[13].

If the frequency dependence of the refractive index in a medium is known, within a

certain frequency range, let us see how the consequent dispersion can be compensated

for. When a dispersionless pulse is desired, the constraint kz = a + ω b must be satisﬁed.
And, by using the last term in eq.(13), one infers that such a constraint is forwarded by

the following relationship between θ and ω:

cos(θ(ω)) =

a + b ω
ω n(ω)

,

(14)

where a and b are arbitrary constants (and b is related to the wave velocity: b = 1/V ).

For convenience, we shall consider a = 0. Then, eq.(6) can be rewritten as

Ψ(ρ, ζ) =

∞

0
Z

S(ω) J0(ρω

n2(ω)
c2 − b2 ) e+iωbζ dω .

(15)

Let us stress that this equation is a priori suited for many kinds of applications. In fact,

whatever its frequency be (in the optical, acoustic, microwave,... range), it constitutes the

integral formula representing a wave which propagates without dispersion in a dispersive

medium.

8

Now, let us mention how it is possible to realize relation (14) for optical frequencies.

Although limited to the case of the air, or of low-dispersion media, the axicon[5,6,11,16] is

one of the simplest means to realize it. Another possibility is using “spectral hole burning

ﬁlters”, or holograms[17]. More in general, one can follow a procedure similar to the one

illustrated in Figure 6.

The process illustrated in Fig.6 is actually simple. In fact, there is a diﬀerent deviation

of the wave vector for each spectral component in passing through the chosen device

(axicon, hologram, and so on): and such a deviation, associated with the dispersion due

to the medium, makes the phase velocity equal for each frequency. This corresponds to

no dispersion for the group-velocity. More details about the physics under consideration

can be found in Ref.[13].

Now, let us consider a nearly gaussian spectrum as that given by eq.(8), and assume

the presence of a dispersive medium whose refractive index (for the frequency range of

interest) can be written in the form

n(ω) = n0 + ω δ ,

(16)

where n0 is a constant, while δ is a free parameter that makes it possible a linear behavior
of n(ω): something that is actually realizable for frequencies far from the resonances asso-

ciated with the used material. Notice that the linear relationship between the refractive

index and the wave frequency assumed in eq.(16) is not necessary: but its existence gets

our calculations simpliﬁed.

In this way, substituting eq.(16) into eq.(15), and considering the spectrum, shifted

towards optical frequencies, given by eq.(8), a relation similar to eq.(17) is found:

Ψ(ρ, ζ, δ) = V

as

Ψ(ρ, ζ, δ) = Ψ(ρ, ζ, 0) + δ

the series at its ﬁrst derivative. For the time being, let us assume this is the case and

9

that there is no problem on truncating eq.(18). One can check Fig.7, which shows typical

values of δ for SiO2, a typical raw-material in ﬁber optics.

Looking at eq.(18), one can notice that its ﬁrst term Ψ(ρ, ζ, 0) is already known to us,

because it coincides with the solution given by our eq.(11). To complete the expansion
(18), one must ﬁnd ∂Ψ
∂δ |δ=0. After some simple mathematical manipulations, one gets
that

having recourse once more to the identity (6.621) of ref.[14]:

where, as before, X is the ordinary X-wave given by eq.(10) and F is again a Gauss’

hypergeometric function. Once more, equation (20’) can be useful in the cases of large

values of m.

Finally, from our basic solution (12) and its ﬁrst derivative (20), one can write the

desired solution of eq.(15) as

Ψ(ρ, ζ) = (−1)n

It is also interesting to notice that, e.g., the approximated Superluminal localized solu-

tion (21) for a dispersive medium has been obtained from simple mathematical operations

(derivatives) applied to the standard “X-wave”.

5. – Optical applications

To illustrate what was said before, two practical examples will be considered, both

in optical frequencies. When mentioning optics, it is natural to refer ourselves to optical

ﬁbers. Then, let us suppose the bulk of the dispersive medium under consideration to be

fused Silica (SiO2).

Far from the medium resonances (which is our case), the refractive index can be

approximated by the well-known Sellmeier equation[18]

n2(ω) = 1 +

Bj ω2
j
j − ω2 ,
ω2

m

Xj=1

(22)

where ωj is the resonance frequency, Bj is the strength of the jth resonance, and N is the
total number of the material resonances that appear in the frequency range of interest. For

typical frequencies of “long-haul transmission” in optics, it is necessary to choose N = 3,

which leads us to the values[18] B1 = 0.6961663, B2 = 0.4079426, B3 = 0.8974794,
λ1 = 0.0684043 µm, λ2 = 0.1162414 µm and λ3 = 9.896161 µm.

Figure 7 illustrates the relation between N and ω, and speciﬁes the range that will be

adopted here. In the two examples, the spectra are localized around the angular frequency
ωc = 23.56×1014 Hz (which corresponds to the wavelength λc = 0.8µm), with two diﬀerent

11

 
bandwidth ∆ω1 = 0.55ωc and ∆ω2 = 0.4ωc. The values of a and N corresponding to
these two situations are a = 1.14592 × 10−14, N = 27, and a = 1.90986 × 10−14, N = 41,
respectively.

Looking at these “windows”, one can notice that Silica does not suﬀer strong vari-

ations of its refractive index. As a matter of fact, a linear approximation to n = n(ω)

is quite satisfactory in these cases. Moreover, for both situations, and for their respec-

tive n0 values, the value of parameter δ results to be very small, verifying condition (15):
which means that it is quite acceptable our truncation of the Taylor expansion. The beam

intensity proﬁles for both bandwidths are shown in Figs. 8 and 9.

In the ﬁrst ﬁgure, one can see a pattern similar to that of Fig.2; but here, of course,

the pulse is much more localized spatially and temporally (typically, it is a fentosecond

pulse).

In the second ﬁgure, one can observe some little diﬀerences with respect to the ﬁrst

one, mainly in the spatial oscillations inside the wave envelope[19]. This may be explained

by taking into account that, for certain values of the bandwidth, the carrier wavelength

become shorter than the width of the spatial envelope; so that one meets a well deﬁned

carrier frequency.

Let us point out that both these waves are transversally and longitudinally localized,

and that, since the dependence of Ψ on z and t is given by ζ = z − V t, they are free from

dispersion, just like a classical X-shaped wave.

6. – Conclusions

In this paper we have ﬁrst worked out analytical Superluminal localized solutions to

the wave equation for arbitrary frequencies and with adjustable bandwidth in vacum. The

same methodology has been then used to obtain new, analytical expressions representing

X-shaped waves (with arbitrary frequencies and adjustable bandwidth) which propagate

in dispersive media. Such expressions have been obtained, on one hand, by adopting the

appropriate spectrum (which made possible to us both choosing the carrier frequency

rather freely, and controlling the spectral bandwidth), and, on the other hand, by hav-

ing recourse to simple mathematics. Finally, we have illustrated some examples of our

12

approach with applications in optics, considering fused Silica as the dispersive medium.
