Abstract

We show that in a class of universal extra dimension models (UED), which solves both the neu-

trino mass and proton decay problem, an admixture of KK photon and KK right handed neutrinos
can provide the required amount of cold dark matter (CDM). This model has two parameters R−1
and MZ ′ (R is the radius of the extra space dimensions and Z ′ the extra neutral gauge boson of the

model). Using the value of the relic CDM density, combined with the results from the cryogenic
searches for CDM, we obtain upper limits on R−1 of about 400

650 GeV and MZ ′

1.5 TeV,

both being accessible to LHC. In some regions of the parameter space, the dark matter-nucleon
scattering cross section can be as high as of 10−44 cm2, which can be probed by the next round of

dark matter search experiments.

INTRODUCTION

The existence of dark matter is now a well established fact. The nature of the dark

matter particle is however still a mystery. Its discovery is going to be a major breakthrough

in the study of physics beyond the standard model of both particle physics and cosmology.

One candidate that has rightly received a great deal of attention is the lightest supersym-

metric particle, the neutralino, since there are many reasons to think that physics may be

supersymmetric around the TeV scale. Furthermore, the Large Hadron Collider machine

at CERN, which is scheduled to start operating in mid-2007, will experimentally explore

physics at the TeV energy scale making it possible to have a detailed understanding of dark

matter related physics.

Another class of models which leads to a very diﬀerent kind of TeV scale physics and

will also be explored at LHC is one where there exist extra space dimensions with sizes of

order of an inverse TeV. In particular there is a class of extra dimension models known as

universal extra dimension models (UED) where all standard model particles live in either

ﬁve (or six) dimensional space time of which one (or two) is (are) compactiﬁed with radius
R−1

TeV[1]. A recently discussed cosmologically interesting point about the UED models

≤

[3, 4] is that the lightest Kaluza-Klein particles of these models being stable can serve as

viable dark matter candidates. This result is nontrivial due to the fact that the dark matter

relic abundance is determined by the interactions in the theory which are predetermined by

standard model. It turns out that the ﬁrst KK mode of the hypercharge boson is the dark

matter candidate provided the inverse size of the extra dimension is less than a TeV.

A generic phenomenological problem with 5D UED models based on the standard model

gauge group is that they can lead to rapid proton decay as well as unsuppressed neutrino

masses. A way to cure the rapid proton decay problem is to consider six dimensions[5]

where the extra space dimensions lead to a new U(1) global symmetry that suppresses

the strength of all baryon number nonconserving operators. On the other hand both the

neutrino mass and the proton decay problem can be solved simultaneously if we extend
the gauge group of the six dimensional model to SU(2)L ×
appropriate orbifolding, a neutrino mass comes out to be of the desired order due to a

U(1)B−L[6]. With

SU(2)R ×

combination two factors: the existence of B

L gauge symmetry and orbifolding which

−

keeps the left-handed singlet neutrino as a zero mode forbid the lower dimensional operators

2

that could give neutrino mass. Another advantage of the 6D models over the 5D ones is

that cancellation of gravitational anomaly automatically leads to the existence of the right

handed neutrinos needed for generating neutrino masses.

In this paper, we point out that the 6D UED models with an extended gauge group of

ref.

[6] provide a two-component picture of dark matter consisting of a KK right handed

neutrino and a KK hypercharge boson. We do a detailed calculation of the relic abundance

of both the νR,KK and the BKK

Y

as well as the cross section for scattering of the dark matter

in the cryogenic detectors in these models. The two main results of this calculation are

that: (i) present experimental limits [8] on the DM-nucleon cross section and the value of

the relic density[9] imply very stringent limits on the the two fundamental parameters of
the theory i.e. R−1 and the second Z ′-boson associated with the extended gauge group
i.e. R−1

1.2 TeV and (ii) for this parameter range, where the relic

550 GeV and MZ ′

≤

≤

density of the KK neutrino contributes signiﬁcantly to the total dark matter relic density,
10−44 cm2, a prediction that is accessible to the next

the DM-nucleon cross-section is

≥

round of dark matter searches. No signal in dark matter searches as well as the searches for
the KK modes and Z ′ in the above range will rule out this class of model and alternative

solutions to the neutrino mass and proton decay problem will have to be sought to keep

the UED models phenomenologically viable. Discovery of two components to dark matter

should also have implications for cosmology of structure formation.

II. THE BASIC FEATURES OF THE MODEL

In this section, we review the basic features of the model in Ref.[6]. The gauge group of

the model is SU(3)c ×
follows:

where, within parenthesis, we have written the quantum numbers that correspond to each

group factor, respectively and the subscript gives the six dimensional chirality chosen to can-

cel gravitational anomaly in six dimensions. Note that there are equal number of positive and
negative six dimensional chirality states. W e denote the gauge bosons as GM , W ±

1,M , W ±

2,M ,

3

and BM , for SU(3)c, SU(2)L, SU(2)R and U(1)B−L respectively, where M = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

denotes the six space-time indices. We will also use the following short hand notations:

Greek letters µ, ν,

· · ·

= 0, 1, 2, 3 to denote usual four dimensions indices and lower case

Latin letters a, b,

· · ·

= 4, 5 for the extra space dimensions. We will also use ~y to denote the

(x4, x5) coordinates of a point in the extra space.

First, we compactify the extra x4, x5 dimensions into a torus, T 2, with equal radii, R,

by imposing periodicity conditions, ϕ(x4, x5) = ϕ(x4 + 2πR, x5) = ϕ(x4, x5 + 2πR) for any

ﬁeld ϕ. This has the eﬀect of breaking the original SO(1, 5) Lorentz symmetry group of the

six dimensional space into the subgroup SO(1, 3)

Z4, where the last factor corresponds

×

to the group of discrete rotations in the x4-x5 plane, by angles of kπ/2 for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.

This is a subgroup of the continuous U(1)45 rotational symmetry contained in SO(1, 5). The

remaining SO(1, 3) symmetry gives the usual 4D Lorentz invariance. The presence of the

surviving Z4 symmetry leads to suppression of proton decay[5] as well as neutrino mass[6].

The zero modes i.e. (+,+) ﬁelds corresponds to the standard model ﬁelds along with an extra

As there are a large number of KK modes, one may worry whether or not electroweak

precision constraints are satisﬁed. To our knowledge, there has been no such analysis for

similar models, and it is outside the scope of the current paper to perform a complete

analysis regarding the electroweak constraints. Therefore, we leave the investigation of this

open issue for future work.

III. DARK MATTER CANDIDATES

In our UED model, there are the following stable KK modes: the lowest KK excitation

of the hypercharge boson, BKK

Y

and the lowest (

) modes ν2,L and ν2,R. Both the heavy

neutrino states couple only the SU(2)R gauge ﬁelds. The former (BKK

) being a KK mode

of the (+,+) state has twice the mass-squared of the lowest KK modes of states of (

∓
type (i.e. ν2,L,R). The discussion of dark matter candidate has to take this into account to

see which particle really is the dark matter. We ﬁnd that in general it is an admixture of

both. We also include the eﬀect of radiative corrections[7] which shift the mass levels by

an amount

and µ the renormalization point. When they are included, the values of the masses diﬀer

∼

slightly but the same lightest modes as identiﬁed here remain.

The νKK

2R,L couple to Z ′; their annihilation rate in the early universe will therefore be
determined by MZ ′ which contributes in s-channel processes. There are also annihilation

6

channels through t-channel processes mediated by W ±
R−1 as well as vR. The discussion of the annihilation channels of BKK

2 , whose mass has a contribution from

is similar to that in

Y

[3, 4].

A. Annihilation Channels of ν2L,2R

Since the yukawa couplings are small, annihilations through gauge boson exchanges pro-

vide the dominant channel. Although we have two independent Dirac fermions for dark
matter, ν(10) and ν(01), they couple the same way to Z ′

µ and have the same annihilation
channel. The only diﬀerence is that, for charged current processes, ν(01) (ν(10)) couples to

For the ﬁnal state of eReR, we have a t-channel process through charge current. The

cross-section therefore involves three pieces: two due to the squared-amplitudes of s

and

−

channel diagrams and another from their interference, denoted by σss, σtt and σst re-

t
−
spectively. Of these, σss has the same form as Eq. 8, and we will show that σtt and σst

is parametrically smaller than σs. Thus the main contribution to the annihilation of ν2L,R
comes from annihilation through s-channel processes mediated through Z ′
µ.

Due to Z

Z ′, there can also be annihilation of KK neutrino into SM Higgs charged

bosons.

processes, where a pair KK neutrino annihilates into a Z ′-boson, which propagates to the
mixing vertex, converting Z ′ to Z, which then decays into h∗h (both neutral and charged)
or massless W +W −. Compared to the amplitude of annihilation of KK neutrino into SM

This ratio is about 1

tudinal modes of the charged gauge bosons, whereas there are many annihilation channels

to the SM fermion-antifermion pairs, the total annihilation cross section is dominated by

the SM fermion-antifermion contributions.

We note here that the annihilation channels to matter ﬁelds diﬀer from the analysis

of [3] and [4] in two important ways. First, in their analysis, the s-channel process is

mediated by Z-boson of the SM, whose mass can be ignored, whereas we have s-channel
processes mediated by Z ′, whose mass is signiﬁcantly higher than the mass of our dark

matter candidate in the region of interest. Second, although we keep all contributions to the

annihilation cross sections for the KK neutrino ν2L,2R in our numerical work, to a workable
approximation we can discard t,u-channel processes mediated by charged gauge bosons W ±

contributions,

we get the total relic density. Clearly, for diﬀerent regions of parameter space, the relative

fraction of the two components will be diﬀerent. In Fig. 1, we combine the two contributions
and plot the allowed regions in the R−1 and MZ ′ parameter space so that we get the ΩνL,Rh2+

Ωγ(1)h2 to the observed value[9]. The central solid line corresponds to the central value of
the dark matter contribution to Ωh2 and the outer lines denote the one σ error range.
The straight lines in Fig.1 give the parameter range of MZ ′ and R−1 for which we get
the noted fraction of the RH neutrino contribution to Ωh2. For small values of MZ ′, the
annihilation of ν(01)
2L,2R is eﬃcient and most of the dark matter is BKK
having a mass of
700 GeV. In fact, along the line 2Mν(01) = 2R−1 = MZ ′, the annihilation
roughly √2R−1
of ν(01)
2L,2R has an s-channel resonance, and its contribution to dark matter relic density is
minimal. Away from the line of s-channel resonance, the contribution of ν(01)
2L,2R to the relic
density increases, and R−1 decreases so as to decrease the relic density due to BKK
, keeping

the total relic density within the allowed range. Using the present bounds on the MZ ′ of the

left-right model from collider data of MZ ′

have an interesting region in the parameter space where the KK sterile neutrinos constitutes
at least 30% of the dark matter density when MZ ′ >

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have proposed a new dark matter scenario which consists of an admixture

of two Kaluza-Klein modes: the right handed neutrinos of a left-right symmetric model

embedded into a six-dimensional brane-bulk theory i.e. νKK

2L,R and BKK

Y

. This class of

universal extra dimensional models solve naturally both the proton stability and neutrino

mass problem by an extended electro-weak gauge group combined with appropriate orbifold

quantum numbers for fermions. Our detailed analysis of dark matter constraints i.e. Ωh2
and DM-nucleon cross-section leads us to predict the existence of an extra Z ′ boson with

mass less than 1.4 TeV which should be accessible at the LHC. We also ﬁnd that, for the

region of parameter space where the relic abundance of νKK
2L,R contributes signiﬁcantly to the
total relic density of dark matter, the DM-nucleon cross-sections are above 10−8 picobarns,

which can be explored in the ongoing and planned dark matter search experiments [8, 11].
