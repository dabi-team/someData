Abstract—In this study, we investigate how the central nervous system (CNS) organizes postural control synergies when individuals 
perform a complex catch-and-throw task in a virtual reality (VR) environment. A Robotic Upright Stand Trainer (RobUST) platform, 
including surface electromyography and kinematics, was used to investigate how the CNS fine-tunes postural synergies with perturbative 
and assist-as-needed force fields. A control group without assistive forces was recruited to elucidate the effect of force fields on motor 
performance and postural synergy organization after the perturbation and during the VR reaching task. We found that the application 
of  assistive  forces  significantly  improved  reaching  and  balance  control.  The  group  receiving  assistive  forces  displayed  four  postural 
control synergies characterized by higher complexity (i.e., greater number of muscles involved). However, control subjects displayed 
eight  synergies  that  recruited  less  number  of  muscles.  In  conclusion,  assistive  forces  reduce  the  number  of  postural  synergies  while 
increasing the complexity of muscle module composition.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

T 

he  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  constrains  muscle  activations  spatially  and  temporally  to  respond  to  self-triggered 
movements, e.g., during reaching or during unanticipated external perturbations 1,2. Within a systems theory view, the neural 
and biomechanical control of a goal-oriented and dexterous task may be simplified by muscle synergies 3. Some authors have 
proposed that the CNS might apply muscle synergies as execution-level sensorimotor solutions to transform task-level motor 
intentions into detailed spatiotemporal muscle patterns in order to reduce motor complexity 1. As a result, the CNS would combine 
muscle synergies to cope with the intricacies of the neuronal computations at the cerebral, brainstem, and spinal cord levels as 
well as to meet the physical demands of the surrounding environment.4 

In-place upright postural control, with a fixed base of support (BOS), is achieved by scaled and timely ascending and descending 
muscle responses around two primary joints: hip and ankle strategies 5–7. These two postural modes of control are not mutually 
exclusive and can co-exist for the dual control of postural orientation and balance 8. The successful attainment of upright stability 
against gravity relies on feedback (i.e., online modulation of postural responses) and feedforward strategies (i.e., postural control 
mechanisms, established prior to an action such as a reach).9–11. Several animal and human studies have shed light on the role of 
muscle synergies to control posture and generate direction-specific muscle forces in the lower limbs during the loss of balance 
12,13, and in arm control during fast and multidirectional reaches 2,14. However, most of the previous research on postural control 
have dealt with how the CNS copes with postural imbalance during unsupported standing (i.e., reactive postural control). In our 
present  study,  we  address  the  fundamental  question  of  how  the  CNS  organizes  postural  muscle  adjustments  during  postural 
imbalance and during the execution of a complex goal-oriented task. In addition, we studied whether external postural assistance 
modulates the organization of postural control synergies. 

To address the research question—which involves the CNS organization of automatic and volitional postural responses (APR and 
VPR,  respectively)  —we  investigated  a  perceptual  serial  three-step  upper  extremity  task  performed  after  a  period  of  postural 
imbalance. The goal-oriented task was perceptual because the subjects had to first spatially localize a flying ball and aim at a target. 
The task was complex because the subjects had to catch a ball, aim, and then throw at a target. Additionally, we investigated if the 
CNS would use different postural synergies in presence of external postural assistance tailored to the subjects’ base of support 
(BOS). 15,16 In the ROAR laboratory of Columbia University, we designed the Robotic Upright Stand Trainer (RobUST) platform 
15,16 to study the human body's balance during standing while responding to force perturbations in the trunk and/or assistant force 
in the pelvis. The system uses lightweight cables to provide trunk perturbations and pelvic assistance and can measure human 
movements, ground reaction forces, and muscle responses. Research has shown that the activation of muscle synergies correlates 
with task-level variables such as the center of pressure displacement17. With the application of assistive force field, the task goal 
remains the same; however, the biomechanics involved in the control of postural stance (center of mass, or COM, with respect to 
the BOS) are different. The goal of force fields is to provide virtual postural assistance tailored to the individual’s balance for 
reducing  stability  challenges.  Neuromechanical  models1,2  lead  us  to  think  that  assistive  force  fields  may  modulate  the 
biomechanical solution space that the musculoskeletal system copes with during the performance of the postural task. Thus, we 
could expect a different muscle organization during a postural task in combination with assistive force fields.  

 
 
In this paper, we also added a Virtual Reality (VR) catch and throw task when the subject is in RobUST. In our opinion, the use of 
a VR setup simplifies the experimental paradigm and circumvents methodological limitations that would be present in a physical 
environment. . We investigated a complex serial four-step catch-and-throw task that consisted of (i) visually tracking a flying ball, 
(ii) catching the ball with the hand remote controller, (iii) aiming at a moving target, and (iv) throwing at the target to accurately 
hit the target center. All participants received RobUST-mediated perturbative forces on the trunk as they were visually tracking 
the flying ball. Additionally, a group of subjects received tailored assistive pelvic force fields when the subject’s pelvic center 
traversed to or beyond a stable boundary. This complex catch-and-throw task allowed us to explore whether “assist-as-needed” 
pelvic force field can modulate postural synergies during this task.   

II.  METHODOLOGY 

A.  Study & Subjects 

The  study  protocol  (AAAR6780)  complied  with  the  ethics  guidelines  for  human  subject  research,  as  established  by  the 
Institutional Review Board of Columbia University. We confirm that all experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional 
Review Board of Columbia University and performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. We confirm that 
informed consent was obtained from all subjects or, if subjects are under 18, from a parent and/or legal guardian. The study follows 
an  experimental  design  with subject  randomization  for  the  experimental (i.e.  assistive-force  fields)  and  control  groups  (i.e.  no 
assistive force-field). A total of 10 healthy young subjects (5 subjects per group) were recruited (Age = 21~36; Females = 7; and 
Right-handed = 8; Mean height = 132.7 ± SE = 6.5cm and Mean weight = 65.7 ± SE = 9.9kg).  

B.  RobUST  

RobUST is a cable-driven robotic platform that can deliver horizontal forces on the subject's upper body through belts worn on 
the  trunk  and  pelvis  (Fig.1).    Each  belt  has  four  cable  connections,  and  each  cable  is  connected  to  the  motor  (Maxon  Motor, 
Switzerland) through pulleys. The subjects stand with each foot placed on a force plate to collect force and pressure data (Bertec 
Force Plate V1, Ohio). A motion capture system (Vicon Vero 2.2, Denver) provides marker positions placed on the belts in real-
time. We use pelvic/ trunk belt’s makers’ average position to represent subjects’ pelvic/trunk center. This device has been described 
in detail in previous publications 15,16. RobUST has two operational modes: (1) Perturbation mode: the subject will be pulled to a 
specific direction (randomly chosen from forward, backward, left and right) by a short pulse of force which is the resultant force 
created  by  four  cables  on  the  trunk  belt;  (2)  Assistive-force-field  mode:  when  the  subject’s  pelvic  center  moves  out  of  the 
predetermined boundary, RobUST provides the subject with an assistive recovery force,  (a resultant force created by four cables 
on pelvic belt  pointing to the original pelvic center). In this study, the trunk belt was set to the perturbation mode, and the pelvic 
belt was set to the assistive-force-field mode of a group of subjects.  Based on the presence or absence of the assistive force field, 
all experimental subjects were divided into two groups. Those who received the pelvic assistive force field in the experiment were 
called the Force-Field group (FF group). Those who did not receive the pelvic assistive force field were called the No-Force-Field 
group (no-FF group). The presence or absence of the assistive force field in the pelvic plane is the critical variable in this research. 
Before doing the experiment, we used the perturbation mode to detect every subject's maximum threshold perturbation in each 
cardinal direction. Subjects were blindfolded and used proprioception and vestibular sensed data to respond to gradually increased 
perturbations from different directions.  The starting perturbation for each direction was set at 40% of the subject’s body weight. 
Then perturbation force was increased by 1% if the subject maintained balance until they lost balance, which means that the subject 
lifted one leg off the floor. The highest force perturbation in each direction was taken as the perturbation threshold for that direction. 
In the subsequent experiment, every subject received perturbations at the perturbation threshold. 

Figure 1 Illustration of experimental setup. The light green lines depict the cables attached to thorax to receive perturbative-force fields. The dark green 
cables represent the pelvic belt to receive assistive-force fields in the experimental group. The remote control was used to catch and throw the virtual ball. 

 
We also experimentally determined the subject's “balance boundary” which is the union of all data points for the excursion of 
the pelvic center during gradually increased perturbations in which the subject did not lose balance. In the subsequent experiment, 
each subject in FF-group received an assistive recovery force when the pelvic center moves out of the balance boundary. Our 
previous paper 15,16 described how to calculate the assistive force in detail. 

C.  Virtual Reality 
The subjects wore a VIVE head-mounted VR to complete a customized game that consisted of catching, aiming, and throwing a 
ball (Fig. 1). In the virtual environment, a subject stood on a wooden bridge surrounded by water with the bull’s eye in the front. 
The position of the virtual bridge corresponds to the location of the force plate in the physical world. Once triggered, the ball is 
lodged towards the subject at the sternum height, with an uncertainty radius = 10cm. The subject had to catch the ball, aim and 
then throw the ball at the target within a constrained time window of 3s. Every time the subject caught and threw the virtual ball 
successfully within the 3s period, the motor event was recorded as successful. Otherwise, it was recorded as unsuccessful. The 
relative horizontal distance in the virtual world between the target and the subject was kept constant at 5m. The ball came to the 
user at constant speed of 30cm/s before being caught by the user. The target to throw the ball was divided into ten circular rings 
with the center as bullseye. For scoring, the bullseye was 10 points and the score in each outer ring decreased linearly from 10 to 
0 (missed target). The VR program ensures that subjects complete the complex VR task within a 3s time window once the ball is 
released, during which they receive the trunk perturbation and pelvic assistance. Each subject participated in two sessions, each 
with 50 catch-and-throws. A break of 5min was included between sessions. (Fig.2) 

D.  Data Processing 

Two force plates (Bertec Force Plate V1, Ohio) were used to collect ground reaction forces (GRF) and COP at 1,000Hz. The 
maximum displacement of COP along antero- posterior and lateral axes (mm) were computed during perturbations. A Surface 
electromyography  (EMG)  at  2000Hz  was  collected  using  a  14  channel  Delsys  Trigno  Wireless  System  (Delsys  Incorporated, 
Massachusetts).  EMG activity was measured bilaterally from 14 leg and trunk muscles: tibialis anterior (TA), lateral gastrocnemius 
(LG), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), gluteus medius (GM), rectus abdominis (ABD), and erector spinae (ES). Force 
plates and EMG systems were synchronized. 

A custom MATLAB program was used to filter and process EMG signals offline. EMG data was first band-passed filter (20-

Figure 2 We define a trial as the duration when the subject completes one set of catching, aiming and throwing movements. When the trial starts, a ball flies 
towards the subject. As the subject is visually aiming at the flying ball(random timepoint between 0~0.8s after the ball is thrown), RobUST delivers a 
perturbative force in one of the four horizontal directions(forward, backward, dominant side and non-dominant side) on the torso. Before the experiment, the 
subjects were asked to close their eyes and receive perturbative forces on the torso that gradually increased in proportion to their body weight. Once they lost 
balance and took a step, we recorded this maximum perturbative force. In the VR experiment, all perturbative forces used this value for the subject. During VR 
task, the FF group additionally receives an assistive pelvic force field at the boundaries of the BOS that is opposite to the direction of the perturbative force. All 
subjects in FF and no-FF group were instructed not to move their feet unless they obligatorily had to take a step. Subjects’ reaction postural control occurs in 
APR 1,2 & 3 bins. Their volitional control of the catch and throw movement is monitored by VPR 1,2 & 3bins. 

 
300Hz),  demeaned,  rectified, and  low-pass  filtered  at  50Hz.  Following  the  method  proposed  by  Torres-Oviedo  et  al13,18,19,  we 
addressed the change in EMG activity across time domains during the APR period in four time windows (or bins).  In Fig.2., the 
pink line “VR Onset” is the timepoint at the beginning when the ball is thrown to the subject, the pink line “RobUST Onset” is the 
timepoint when the RobUST provides a perturbation to the subject, its time is randomly chosen in a range 0~0.8 second after the 
“VR Onset”. We chose four bins as follows: 75ms-background (BK) before the RobUST Onset (the brown bin in Fig.2.), 100-
175ms (APR1) immediately after RobUST Onset, 175-250ms (APR2) and 250-325ms (APR3) after RobUST Onset20. We also 
computed postural EMG activity while the subjects performed the complex VR catch-and-throw task to study the behavior during 
VPR period.  Because the time periods during the catch and throw were variable across trials, perturbation directions and subjects, 
a fixed time window, as the one proposed for APR, was no longer suitable to accurately reflect EMG muscle activity changes 
during VPR. Instead, we used an amplitude threshold where we identified the maximum value of EMG activity and then used a 
5% peak as threshold for muscle offsets. In Fig. 2, VPR1 would correspond to the 75ms blue bin after APR3,which is 325-400ms 
after RobUST Onset, VPR2 is the green bin and its center is at the peak value of EMG signal and VPR3 is the red bin whose center 
is at the intersection point of the light blue threshold line and the dark blue EMG signal. For all time bins (BK, APR 1,2,3 & VPR 
1,2,3) in this paper, their lengths are 75ms.  

A trial is seen as the whole process of catch and throw movement (Fig.2). For each of the 14 EMG muscle channels (EMG 
sensors are symmetrically located in subject’s left and right side, 7 EMG channels in each side, 14 channels in total) in each trial, 
the average muscle activity in each of the seven bins was computed (BK, APR1,2,3 & VPR1,2,3). From these, we generated a data 
vector for each muscle that contained 14 muscle data points [7bins × 4 directions (Backwards, forwards, non-dominant side and 
dominant side) × 50 times catch and throw)].  For all perturbation directions and time bins across subjects, the averaged EMG data 
values in the vector were then normalized to their respective maximum amplitudes (iEMG) so that each muscle value was between 
0 and 1 so that we can compare the averaged 7 bins’ values among trials or sessions or subjects or muscles.  

E.  Extraction of Muscle Synergies 

The non-negative matrix factorization method was used to extract muscle synergy from the raw EMG signals18,21–23. This linear 
decomposition method assumes that the activation state of each muscle in a given time period is composed of a linear combination 
of several muscle synergies. Each muscle synergy Wi is activated by the synergy activation coefficient ci, also called the neural 
command coefficient. Therefore, the net muscle activation vector M can be expressed as: 

where Wi is a vector that represents the relative activation level of muscle activity in a muscle group and defined by muscle synergy 
i. Each element of Wi represents the relative contribution of a muscle to the muscle synergy vector Wi, and the value ranges from 
0 to 1.    For each muscle synergy, elements in Wi are constant, and the total muscle synergy is regulated by a single scalar non-
negative activation coefficient ci, which represents the neural command for muscle synergy. It determines the relative contribution 
of  muscle  synergy  Wi  to  the  overall  muscle  activation  pattern  M.  For  each  synergy  Wi,  the  set  of  activations  ci  across  all 
perturbation directions during BK and APRs (or VPRs) is the vector Ci. In the three APRs (or VPRs), Ci’s are the muscle tuning 
curves which characterize how a muscle synergy Wi gets modulated by the perturbation directions and time.

SPSS (IBM, version 27, 2020) was used for statistical analysis. The alpha rate was set at 0.05. Normal distribution of the data 
was examined with Shapiro-Wilk test and visually inspected with Q-Q plots. Motor behavior data (e.g., successful reaches and VR 
scoring) were not normally distributed and thus a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U was applied. COP-related kinematics between 
groups were examined with independent t-tests. In our muscle synergy analysis, a three-way mixed Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
with two between-factors (group: FF and no-FF; and perturbation direction: forward, backward, dominant, and non-dominant) and 
one repeated measures-factor (75ms-bins: 1, 2, and 3) was applied to examine significant spatial-temporal differences in muscle 
tuning  curve  data.  In  case  of  a  significant  ANOVA  model,  we  proceeded  with  post-hoc  testing  with  Bonferroni’s  inequality 
procedure for multiple comparisons. We studied homoscedasticity and multicollinearity of the data with Levene’s and Mauchly’s 
sphericity  tests,  respectively.  In  case  that  the  assumptions  of  homogeneity  and  sphericity  were  violated,  adjusted  p-values  to 
variance-corrected and Greenhouse-Geisser correction were reported.

III.  RESULTS 

Overall, subjects in the FF group performed more effectively than those in the no-FF group during the VR catch-and-throw task 
(Fig. 3). Subjects in the FF group showed more successful catches (Median = 50, IQR = 3) than those in the no-FF group (Median 
= 48, IQR =14); U = 6.5, p = 0.03, η2 = 53%. Similarly, subjects in the FF group were capable of executing greater number of 
throws (Median = 36, IQR = 20) than those in the no-FF group (Median = 26, IQR = 26); U = 7.0, p = 0.04; η2 = 51%. The use of 
pelvic assistive fore fields improved accuracy (FF group Median = 176, IQR =194 and no-FF group Median = 113, IQR = 166); 
however, this difference was not statistically different between groups (U = 9.0, p = 0.09).

number of successful catching/throwing trials divided by the total number of trials. The application of the assistive pelvic force field improved the success of the 
motor behaviors. * = p < 0.05. 

B.  Balance control during postural imbalance  
The subjects in the FF group performed the VR catch-and-throw task with greater level of balance control, as determined by COP-
related variables (Table 1). Compared to participants in no-FF group, the FF group displayed reduced balance excursion (t(8) = 
2.32; p = 0.049), and less variability of spatial COP (t(8) =2.79; p = 0.024) and COP velocity (t(8) = 2.31; p = 0.05)

C.  Muscle Synergy Analysis 
1)  Temporal-spatial features of APR: Muscle Tuning 

Overall, the muscle tuning curves displayed that the activation level of certain muscles were different between groups but not 
sensitive to the directionality of the trunk perturbations (Fig. 4). However, the CNS fine-tuned APR differently in the presence 
of pelvic assistive-force fields (Fig. 5). 
 Tibialis Anterior (TA) 

We  found  a  main  group  effect  on  TA  (F(1,32)  =  4.73,  p  =  0.037,  partial  η2  =  13%).  The  No-FF  group  (Mean  TA 
activation = 0.022 ±SE = 0.003) showed greater TA activation than the FF group (Mean TA activation = 0.011 ±SE = 
0.004) across APR1,APR2 and APR3.

APR2 (Mean BF activation during APR1 = 0.078 ±SE = 0.012, p < 0.001; and Mean BF activation during APR2 = 
0.082 ±SE = 0.012, p = 0.001).  

Rectus Abdominis (ABD) 

No significant group differences were found for ABD (F (1,32) = 3.54, p = 0.069, partial η2 = 1%).  

Erector Espinae (ES) 

Fig. 5 represents normalized postural automatic (A) and volitional (B) muscle responses across trials, subjects and force field groups (± 2SE). A) The no-FF 
group showed greater level of activation of TA (a distal muscle related to ankle strategy); whereas the FF group displayed greater muscle activation of RF. In the 
no-FF group, most of the muscles showed the greatest level of activity within APR3. B) The no-FF group showed greater volitional activity during the ball task 
in TA, LG and GM than the FF group. * = p < 0.05. FF = Force field. Bilat = Bilateral. 

 
We found a marginal Group X Bin interaction effect on ES (F (1.02, 32.60) = 4.06, p = 0.052, partial η2 = 11%). In the 
no-FF group, the APR3 (Mean ES activation during APR3 = 0.058 ±SE = 0.009) was significantly greater than APR1 
and APR2 (Mean ES activation during APR1 = 0.034 ±SE = 0.002, p = 0.015; and Mean ES activation during APR2 = 
0.036 ±SE = 0.003, p = 0.021).  

Gluteus Medius (GM) 

We found a Group X Bin interaction effect on GM (F (1.49,47.60) = 6.33, p = 0.007, partial η2 = 17%). In the no-FF 
group, APR3 (Mean GM activation during APR3 = 0.108 ±SE =0.009) showed a significant activation increase than 
APR1 and APR2 (Mean GM activation during APR1 = 0.101 ±SE = 0.009, p = 0.001; and Mean GM activation during 
APR2 = 0.101 ±SE = 0.009, p = 0.002).

Tibialis Anterior (TA) 

We found an interaction group X bin effect on TA (F (1.009, 32.12) = 4.57, p = 0.040, partial η2 = 13%) between FF 
and no-FF groups across VPR1, VPR2 and VPR3. The No-FF group showed greater TA activation than the FF group 
during VPR1 (Mean No-FF = 0.011 ± SE = 0.001 and Mean FF = 0.006 ± SE =0.002, p = 0.016) and VPR2 (Mean No-
FF = 0.150 ± SE = 0.029 and Mean FF = 0.049 ± SE = 0.036, p = 0.038). Only the No-FF group displayed significantly 
greater TA during VPR2 (Mean no-FF = 0.150 ± SE = 0.029, p < 0.001) than VPR1 (Mean no-FF = 0.011 ± SE = 0.001, 
p < 0.001). 
Lateral Gastrocnemius (LG) 

We found an interaction group X bin effect on LG (F (1.009, 32.279) = 5.81, p = 0.022, partial η2 = 16%) between FF 
and no-FF groups in VPR2. No-FF group showed greater LG activity in VPR2 compared to VPR1 (Mean No-FF = 
0.015 ± SE = 0.002, p < 0.001) and VPR3 (Mean No-FF = 0.014 ± SE = 0.002, p < 0.001).  

Rectus Femoris (RF) 

We found a main group effect on RF (F (1.02, 32.47) = 127.74, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 80%). Subjects in both the FF 
and no-FF groups demonstrated a significant increase of RF activity in VPR2 (mean bin1 = 0.031 ± 0.003, mean bin2 
= 0.138 ± 0.010, and mean VPR3 = 0.031 ± 0.002).  

Biceps Femoris (BF) 

Similar to RF, we found main group effect on BF (F (1.02, 32.47) = 127.74, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 80%). Subjects in 
both the FF and no-FF groups demonstrated a significant increase of BF activity in VPR2 (mean VPR1 = 0.037 ± 0.004, 
mean VPR2 = 0.146 ± 0.008, and mean VPR3 = 0.036 ± 0.004, p < 0.001).  

Gluteus Medius (GM) 

We found an interaction group X bin effect on GM (F (1.02, 32.45) = 7.82, p = 0.008, partial η2 = 20%) between FF 
and no-FF groups in VPR2. No-FF group showed greater GM activation than the FF group (Mean No-FF VPR2 = 0.179 
± SE = 0.019 and Mean FF VPR2 = 0.106 ± SE = 0.024, p =0.024). We found that No-FF group had significantly greater 
GM during VPR2 than VPR1(Mean no-FF = 0.041 ± SE = 0.004, p < 0.001) and VPR3 (Mean no-FF = 0.039 ± SE = 
0.004, p < 0.001). The FF group also showed greater GM activity during VPR2 than VPR1 or VPR3, which showed 
similar levels of muscle activation (Mean FF VPR1 = 0.044 ± SE =0.005 and Mean FF VPR3 = 0.044 ± SE = 0.004, p 
< 0.001). 
Rectus Abdominis (ABD) 

We found a main group effect on ABD (F (1.00, 32.02) =25.04, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 44%). Subjects in both the FF 
and no-FF groups demonstrated a significant increase of RF activity in VPR2 (mean VPR1 = 0.012 ± 0.001, mean VPR2 
= 0.066 ± 0.011, and mean VPR3 = 0.011 ± 0.001). 

Erector Espinae (ES) 

We found a main group effect on ES (F (1.02, 32.58) = 45.85, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 59%). Subjects in both the FF and 
no-FF groups demonstrated a significant increase of ES activity in VPR2 (mean VPR1 = 0.015 ± 0.002, mean VPR2 = 
0.100 ± 0.013, and mean VPR3 = 0.011 ± 0.001). 

D.  Postural Synergy Composition during APR and VPR 

The application of a pelvic assistive-force field modulated the composition of postural muscle synergies during APR and VPR 
(Fig.  6).  The  synergy  module  (Wi)  involved  the  activation  of  several  muscles  that  were  characterized  by  diverse  anatomical 
locations between groups. Moreover, muscle synergies were more prevalent on specific perturbation directions and during specific 
bins (Ci).

from EMG data during quiet stance and three APR time bins. Each bar represents the relative level of activation of each muscle within the synergy.   B: 
activation coefficients, Ci, for each of the synergies during each time bin in multiple perturbation directions. NTA =Non-dominant Tibialis Anterior; DTA = 
Dominant Tibialis Anterior Percentages indicate the amount of total data variability accounted for by each component. 
In the FF group, the subjects demonstrated that a total of 4 synergies could optimally reconstruct the background (Bin0) and the 
three 75ms-bins of each muscle across trials, subjects, and between the two FF conditions—as determined by a VAF = 89% for 
APR and VAF = 90.31% for VPR. The no-FF group however, required a total of 8 muscle synergies to reach a VAF = 89% and 
VAF = 91.97% during APR and VPR, respectively. 
1)  Functional Organization of Postural Synergies: APR. 

All  muscles  within  a  singular  synergy,  regardless  of  their  level  of  activation,  should  play  a  role  in  the  control  of  postural 
adjustments. Nonetheless, if we consider postural muscles highly involved within the synergy (≥ 0.5), we can note that subjects 
in the FF group displayed synergies that predominantly included proximal muscles–which are likely related to a hip strategy. 
This observation is reflected in muscle synergy W1 (VAF = 67%), where the biarticular muscles RF (hip flexion) and BF (hip 
extension) in conjunction with GM (stabilizer) and ABD to control reactive postural adjustments. In the no-FF group, however, 
these hip-related muscles were distributed across several muscle synergies: synergy W1 (VAF = 18%) for ABD, synergy W2 
(VAF = 31%) for RF and GM, and synergy W4 (VAF = 12%) for BF. On the contrary, the no-FF group showed different 
synergies that mainly recruited distal muscles, which are more likely related to an ankle postural control strategy: synergy W5 
(VAF = 4%) for TA, synergy W6 (VAF = 8%) for LG, and synergy W7 (VAF = 8%) for LG. Nonetheless, the FF group only 
showed synergy W3 (VAF = 6%) with TA, as a distal muscle potentially involved in an ankle strategy (Fig. 6). 

2)  Functional Organization of Postural Synergies: VPR. 

Overall, there was a change in the muscle module composition of the postural synergies during VPR compared to APR in both 
FF and No-FF groups. Although, this change was perhaps more obvious in the latter group. 
In synergy W1 (VAF = 47%), excluding BF, ABS, GM, and RF were active but less involved (< 0.5) than during APR (Fig. 
6). In W2 (VAF = 20%), GM played a more relevant role than in APR. Also, ES was more involved in synergies W3 (VAF = 
15%) and W4 (VAF = 3%). In the no-FF group, synergies W1 (VAF = 20%) and W2 (VAF = 22%) were more complex and 
characterized by greater involvement of some hip muscles such as RF and GM. In spite of the presence of hip muscles during 
VPR, the No-FF group showed a predominance activation of TA within synergy W3 (VAF = 9%). (Fig. 6) 

In this study, we investigated automatic (APR) and volitional (VPR) postural control adjustments in healthy young subjects 
during postural imbalance and while executing a perceptual multistep motor task in a VR environment (i.e., VR catch-and-throw 

IV.  DISCUSSION 

 
  
task). Also, we addressed the modulatory effect on balance via “assist-as-needed” force fields at the pelvis mediated by RobUST. 
We found that subjects receiving assistive-force fields were more successful in the VR catch-and-throw task and demonstrated 
more proficient postural control during the execution of the task. Furthermore, our outcomes revealed that the CNS orchestrated 
postural synergies to control standing balance differently during APR and VPR stages with the application of assistive-force fields. 
Due to the complexity of the postural and reaching task, postural synergies were not direction-specific and as such the perturbation 
direction did not have a significant impact on muscle tuning.  

Previous  research  has  shown  that  robotic  systems  that  apply  force  fields  can  enhance  motor  performance  and  induce  motor 
learning  14.  In  a  previous  study,  we  showed  the  applicability  of  RobUST  for  the  dual  purpose  of  delivering  direction-specific 
perturbations and assistive-force fields to supplement the subject’s efforts in restoring balance. The main goal of the previously 
investigated robotic-aided strategy was to promote in-place postural control during standing  without losing balance (i.e., falls, 
reaching for support, or taking a step)16,24. In more recent studies, we have also demonstrated the potential capability of RobUST, 
and related motorized cable-driven systems (i.e. trunk-support-trainer), to functionally improve bipedal postural stance and seated 
postural control during activity-based interventions in people with spinal cord injury and children with cerebral palsy 25,26. With 
the present study, we aim at expanding on our previous findings by elucidating how the CNS organizes postural control during a 
complex VR catch-and-throw task. 

A.  Motor behavior & postural control improvements with and without pelvic assistive-force fields 

The attentional, visual perception, motor planning, and high-level of motor coordination required to catch a ball is progressively 
acquired during motor development. The inherent complexity for catching is such that children do not acquire the motor ability to 
predict the position of a flying ball and effectively coordinate the control of upper extremities and posture until late childhood—
by the age of 10yrs27–29.  

The CNS must also overcome any potential balance disruptions that occur during standing position from the context or secondary 
to the performance of a motor task such as reaching 9,13. In our study, we added postural trunk perturbations at the start of the VR 
catch-and-throw task (see Fig. 2), during the time window that subjects were visually aiming at the flying ball and theoretically 
preparing the motor plan to catch it (i.e., APR stage). Once the trunk perturbation was delivered, the application of an assistive 
force field at the pelvis and tailored to the individual’s BOS not only enhanced standing balance control but also improved the 
performance of the VR catch-and-throw task. 

B.  Fine-tuning of spatiotemporal muscle activations 

Similar to previous research13,21, we analyzed multiple time windows during both APR—which includes reactive balance control 
while visually targeting the ball during the trunk perturbation—and VPR—which includes the resulting preparatory and online 
postural control strategies during the VR catch-and-throw task15. The application of an external assistive-force field to enhance 
balance  control,  mainly  during  the  APR  stage,  changes  the  CNS  organization  of  postural  synergies.  We  also  found  that  this 
modulatory force field effect propagated across APR and VPR stages.  

Research have found that postural synergies coping with automatic postural responses (<325ms after perturbation) prioritize not 
only the level of activation but also the muscle onset timing in response to external surface perturbations 12. Cheung at al (2009) 
investigated the effect of attaching inertial loads on frog legs during several motor behaviors—kicking, jumping, stepping, and 
swimming.  They  found  that  EMG  amplitudes  and  durations  were  dependent  on  the  presence  of  such  loads  and  these 
electromyographic changes were mediated by sensory signals. These load-related EMG adjustments support that invariant muscle 
synergies can be modulated to counteract unexpected force demands30. Another study applying direction-specific moving platforms 
in cats found that postural COP-related kinematics and their associated sensory feedback drive the timing and the muscle units that 
compound postural synergies 10,12. Similarly, we found that the improvement of COP-related balance kinematics via assistive-force 
fields results in the activation of different muscles and synergistic postural control. In the No-FF group, participants showed greater 
activity of TA across APR1, APR2 and APR3; which may functionally be categorized as a key distal muscle for postural control 
during backward body displacements during an ankle strategy mode of control 16. The No-FF group particularly showed greater 
activity  of  some  dorsal  postural  muscles  (BF  and  ES)  and  lateral  pelvic  stabilizer  GM—mainly  by  the  end  of  the  APR  stage 
(APR3).  In  the  FF-group  however,  some  muscles  such  as  RF  were  activated  early  during  APR.  These  findings  support  the 
mechanical effect of the assistive-force field to enhance balance without the need of increased muscle activity to counteract the 
imposed postural imbalance via perturbative forces 8.  

During the VPR, all participants in the FF and No-FF groups activated postural muscles mainly related to a hip control strategy: 
RF, BF, ABD, and ES. This hip control mode was highly relevant during VPR2, which coincided with the timepoint when these 
hip-related muscles peaked during the performance of the VR catch-and-throw task. This finding indicates that the postural control 
of the body during the VR catch-and-throw task mainly rely on a hip control strategy and was developed similarly by FF and No-
FF participants. However, during the VPR, the participants in the No-FF group recruited the rest of postural muscles (TA, LG, and 
GM) with higher level of activity than those included in the FF group; probably because the subjects in the FF group were already 
stable within the BOS boundaries while performing the VR catch-and-throw task. Furthermore, this finding is in agreement with 
the  better  postural  performance  and  greater  motor  success  observed  in  the  FF  group  during  the  VR  catch-and-throw task.  An 

 
important biomechanical aspect to notice is that a greater activation of TA and LG in the No-FF can indicate that the participants 
recruited a mixed hip-ankle postural control strategy. In support of this results, other studies have shown that the CNS can organize 
postural control within a continuum between ankle and hip control strategies during both perturbed and quiet upright stance 8,31,32. 
Studies also show that high-amplitude perturbations can recruit hip control strategies and that trunk movements in standing invoke 
different modes of postural control—including the knee as an intermediary control strategy 5.  

C.  Postural Synergy Composition during APR and VPR 

In spite of the innate character embedded in postural synergies, humans may accomplish goal-oriented actions employing an 
immense  variety  of  motor  strategies—kinematic  and kinetic  configurations,  and  spatiotemporal muscle  activation  patterns  1,12. 
Moreover, the mechanical system, motor experience, and surroundings might add some degree of adaptability in what refers to the 
number and type of muscles involved in a particular postural synergy. Research has shown that synergies are directionally tuned 
to body COM displacements and muscle units are organized to control the limb forces needed to react against direction-specific 
postural perturbations 33. Thus, it is not surprising that in our experiment the application of an assistive-force field modulated the 
number of postural synergies involved in the control of posture as well as the composition of the synergy vectors (Wi). However, 
we  did  not  find  a  high-level  dependency  of  direction-specificity  in  postural  synergies.  Furthermore,  we  did  not  find  a  strong 
relationship between muscle tuning curves and synergy coefficient activations per perturbation direction. These findings do not 
agree with other authors who found that only six synergies could account for specific spatial balance recovery regions during 
moving platform perturbations 32. This result is expected however, since our VR catch-and-throw task was complex, highly under 
volitional control, and characterized by multiple corrective postural control directions secondary to multidirectional perturbative 
force-fields.  Another  potential  reason  is  that  a  different  action  goal  could  have been  established  by  the  CNS  (standing  versus 
standing while planning and performing a complex reaching task); which would demand a different number of postural synergies 
and muscle units. 

Research in reactive postural control has shown that six or fewer postural synergies are enough to control reactive balance during 
multidirectional platform-based perturbations  8,13,31,32. In our study, we investigated a different motor task, and we surprisingly 
found a different number of postural synergies for both FF and No-FF groups. The FF group just recruited a total of four postural 
synergies to account for the improved postural imbalance while receiving the assistive-force field. Nonetheless, the No-FF group, 
doubled the number of synergies to eight to control posture during APR and VPR. Our data also revealed that FF participants 
showed  fewer  but  more  complex  synergy  vectors  than  No-FF  subjects.  Therefore,  the  application  of  assistive-force  fields 
substantially modified how the CNS constructs and organizes these low-level muscle “blocks” to control posture during imbalance 
conditions or while carrying a complex perceptual-motor reach task. A large number of muscles within each synergy may suggest 
that the CNS can build up a more effective postural foundation to enable subjects to carry satisfactorily complex reaching actions. 
Once again, this observation is supported by the fact that FF participants showed greater number of successful catches and throws, 
and less maximum COP excursions, when RobUST was configured to deliver postural assistive-force fields. 

D.  Functional Organization and Activation of Postural Synergies 

As we discussed previously, postural ankle and hip strategies are independent modes of control that can functionally co-exist 
during postural  control,  aside  from  intermediary knee  control  strategies  15,16.  Most  of  the  previous  synergy  studies  in  postural 
standing have applied perturbations via moving platforms. In a different approach, our RobUST experimental setup uses direction-
specific trunk perturbations based on the participant’s total body weight percent, as defined by the point of maximum postural 
instability (i.e., presence of reaching or stepping strategies)  13. In line with other studies, we found mixed postural strategies in 
both groups 5,18,33. 

Research  has  shown  the  existence  of  anticipatory  synergistic  muscle  control  during  unfamiliar  or  challenging  self-triggered 
movements. These feedforward mechanisms occur 100-150ms prior to the initiation of the action and even before the presence of 
anticipatory  postural  adjustments  2.  Hence,  we  believe  that  in  our  study,  the  synergistic  muscle  control  during  APR  was 
programmed  by  sensory  feedback.  The  reason  is  because  the  participants  had  to  counteract  the  trunk  perturbation  exerted  by 
RobUST while visually tracking the ball in standing position. Nonetheless, our outcomes show that the assistive-force field had an 
effect on these sensory-based postural synergies. During APR, subjects in the FF group displayed muscles involved in a postural 
hip strategy (mainly W1); whereas in the No-FF group, the proximal muscles were found within several postural synergies (W1, 
W2 and W4). No-FF participants presented several synergies involving muscles related to an ankle strategy. Only synergy W3 in 
the FF group included TA, and to less extent LG distributed across synergies W1, W2, and W3. Overall, there was a change in the 
muscle module composition of the postural synergies during VPR compared to APR in both FF and No-FF groups. Although, this 
change was mainly observed in the latter group.  

Our results revealed certain changes in the composition of the synergy vectors for both FF and No-FF groups during VPR. For 
instance, No-FF participants showed postural synergies characterized by greater complexity (W1 and W2) and potentially involved 
in a hip strategy. In the FF group, the activity of some muscles (ABD in W1 and ES in W2) substantially decreased during VPR. 
Considering that postural synergies are the neural modules that translate high-level intentions into low-level muscle activations 34, 
a different anatomical distribution of postural muscles and their level of activation may just represent that that the CNS re-defined 

 
two different motor goals during APR (i.e., balance) and VPR (i.e., reaching accuracy). This observation is supported by the lack 
of correlation of the relative contribution of muscle activations within synergy vectors between APR and VPR stages.  

Even though we did not prioritize how the CNS controls reaching in our study, we cannot disregard the high neural complexity 
involved in the VR catch-and-throw task under investigation in our study groups. Research has shown the involvement of parieto-
frontal areas for the control of goal-directed upper extremity movements34. A convoluted visual and sensorimotor neural processing 
would justify once again the need for the CNS to also employ low dimensional synergies to simplify and dictate the mechanical 
control of the arms via brainstem and spinal cord circuits2,14,35. In addition, our participants had to overcome the robotic-mediated 
postural challenge; which may explain why the No-FF group elicited eight postural synergies to control standing balance while 
planning and executing the complex VR task. 

E.  Study limitations 

When completing complex tasks and maintaining balance, human body needs not only the driving force provided by muscle 
tissue but also the support and restriction of the skeletal system. The bone structure limits the relative position and range of action 
of the muscles. Therefore, when studying muscle synergy, not only the optimal dimensionality reduction algorithm of the nervous 
system, but also the coordination relationship between muscle groups and bones must be considered. Vicon system uses markers 
to get the precise spatial position and rotation angle of each bone key point of subjects. However, because the infrared positioning 
equipment of the Vicon system will interfere with the infrared positioning equipment of the VR device, this study did not collect 
the position information of the bones. 

RobUST can provide subjects with controllable and precise force fields on the torso and pelvis levels. However, these force fields 
are two-dimensional, so they cannot well simulate the three-dimensional interference force field received by the human body in 
daily life. Based on this limitation, we are improving RobUST to provide a three-dimensional force field. 

Another limitation is that we do not have a large sample size. We recruited a total of 10 subjects (5 subjects per group). A larger 
sample size would likely help to identify any effect of perturbation direction. Besides, in our experiment we didn’t analyze the 
trunk muscles which may be particularly important for the task involving coordination between the legs and arms. 

V.  CONCLUSION 

Our study shows that the application of an assistive-force field significantly modulates how the CNS organizes and fine-tunes 
postural synergies. The underlying postural synergies of those participants receiving assistive-force fields involved four synergy 
vectors composed by high activation levels of a minimum of six muscles. This synergy structure was associated with greater motor 
success and balance control in standing. We also observed a different composition of the synergy vectors between APR (standing 
during postural imbalance and visually tracking the flying ball) and VPR (executing the VR catch-and-throw task). This different 
synergy organization was more likely related to the characteristic motor intention of either APR or VPR. The outcomes of the 
present  study  address  how  our  activity-based  interventions  with  RobUST  may  be  modulating  how  the  CNS  controls  posture. 
Further studies are warranted to investigate this experimental paradigm as a potential postural training in neuromotor populations
