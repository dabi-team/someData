Abstract— In this letter, we study optimal multicast of tiled
360 virtual reality (VR) video from one server (base station or
access point) to multiple users in an orthogonal frequency division
multiple access (OFDMA) system. For given video quality, we
optimize the subcarrier, transmission power and transmission
rate allocation to minimize the total transmission power. For
given transmission power budget, we optimize the subcarrier,
transmission power and transmission rate allocation to maximize
the received video quality. These two optimization problems
are non-convex problems. We obtain a globally optimal closed-
form solution and a near optimal solution of the two problems,
separately, both revealing important design insights for multicast
of tiled 360 VR video in OFDMA systems.

Index Terms— virtual reality, 360 video, multicast, OFDMA.

I. INTRODUCTION

A virtual reality (VR) video is generated by capturing a
scene of interest from all directions at the same time. A user
wearing a VR headset can freely watch the scene of interest in
any viewing direction at any time, hence enjoying immersive
viewing experience. VR has vast applications in entertainment,
education, medicine, etc. Transmitting an entire 360 VR video
which is of a much larger size than a traditional video brings a
heavy burden to wireless networks. To improve transmission
efﬁciency and avoid view switch delay, a 360 VR video is
divided into smaller rectangular segments of the same size,
referred to as tiles, and the set of tiles covering a user’s current
ﬁeld-of-view (FoV) and the FoVs that may be watched shortly
should be transmitted simultaneously [1].

In [2]–[5], the authors consider 360 VR video transmission
in single-user [2], [3] and multi-user [4], [5] wireless networks,
and optimize video encoding parameters [2], [3] as well as
resource allocation [4], [5] to maximize the received 360
VR video quality. The optimization problems in [2]–[5] are
discrete, and the obtained solutions do not offer many design
insights. In [4], multicast opportunities are ignored, and hence
the resulting solution may not be efﬁcient for multi-user wire-
less networks. In [5], multicast opportunities are considered,
but the tiles are treated separately in the optimization. This

leads to prohibitively high computational complexity, as the
number of tiles to be transmitted is usually quite large. There-
fore, it is still not known how the required FoVs and channel
conditions of all users affect optimal resource allocation and
how to obtain low-complexity resource allocation for 360 VR
video transmission in multi-user wireless networks.

In this letter, we would like to address the aforementioned
issues. We aim to design optimal multicast of tiled 360 VR
video from one server (base station or access point) to multiple
users in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA) system. We formulate optimal multicast of tiled
360 VR video as multi-group multicast optimization problems.
Speciﬁcally, for given video quality, we optimize the subcar-
rier, power and rate allocation to minimize the total transmis-
sion power. We obtain a globally optimal closed-form solution
of this problem (under a mild condition), which reveals that
the minimum transmission power increases exponentially with
the total number of tiles that need to be transmitted. For given
transmission power budget, we optimize the subcarrier, power
and rate allocation to maximize the received video quality. We
obtain a near optimal solution of this problem, which reveals
that the maximum video quality is inversely proportional to
the maximum number of tiles that need to be transmitted for
all viewing directions. To the best of our knowledge, these
important design insights have never been analytically veriﬁed
in existing literature. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the
advantage of the proposed solutions.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

As illustrated in Fig. 1, we consider multicast of a 360
VR video from a single-antenna server (base station or access
point) to K (≥ 1) single-antenna users, denoted by K ,
in an OFDMA system.1 Consider Mh × Mv
{1, . . . , K},
viewing directions, where Mh and Mv represent the numbers
of horizontal and vertical viewing directions. The (mh, mv)-th
viewing direction refers to the viewing direction in the mh-
th row and mv-th column. When a VR user is interested in
one viewing direction, he can view a rectangular FoV of size
Fh × Fv (in rad×rad) with the viewing direction as its center.
The viewing direction of each user can be captured by sensors
in his VR headset.

To improve transmission efﬁciency, we consider tiling. In
particular, the 360 VR video is divided into Vh×Vv rectangular
segments of the same size, referred to as tiles, where Vh and
Vv represent the numbers of segments in each row and each

1Note that the setup is similar to that considered in our previous work [6],
except that in this paper, we consider an OFDMA system. We present the
details of the setup here for completeness.

column, respectively. We consider that all tiles have the same
encoding rate, denoted by D (in bit/s). Note that the encoding
rate reﬂects the video quality. To avoid view switch delay, for
each user, the set of tiles that cover its current FoV and the
FoVs that may be watched shortly will be delivered.2

Let Xk ∈ X denote the viewing direction of user k,
where X , {(mh, mv)|mh = 1, . . . , Mh, mv = 1, . . . , Mv}
represents the set of all possible viewing directions of each
user. Let X , (Xk)k∈K ∈ X , X K denote the system
viewing direction state, and let Φ(X) denote the corresponding
set of tiles that need to be transmitted to all users. In order
to utilize multicast opportunities for improving transmission
efﬁciency, we divide Φ(X) into I(X) disjoint non-empty sets
Si(X), i ∈ I(X) , {1, . . . , I(X)}. For all i, j ∈ I(X), i 6= j,
Si(X) and Sj(X) are for different groups of users. Let Si(X)
denote the number of tiles in set Si(X). We jointly consider
the tiles in each set, instead of treating them separately (as in
[5]).3 Let Ki(X) denote the set of users that need to receive
the tiles in Si(X). Then, multicast of tiled 360 VR video can
be viewed as multi-group multicast.4

i.e.,

Consider N subcarriers, denoted by N , {1, . . . , N }. Each
subcarrier has a bandwidth B (in Hz). Consider one frame.
Assume block fading,
the channel condition on each
subcarrier does not change within one frame [4]. Let Hn,k ∈
H denote the power of the channel (i.e., channel state) on
subcarrier n between the server and user k, where H denotes
the ﬁnite channel state space. Let H , (Hn,k)n∈N ,k∈K ∈
H , HN K denote the system channel state. The system state
consists of X and H, denoted by (X, H) ∈ X × H. We
assume that the server is aware of the system state (X, H),
e.g., by explicit feedbacks from all users.

Let µn,i(X, H) ∈ {0, 1} denote the subcarrier assignment
indicator for subcarrier n and the tiles in Si(X), where
µn,i(X, H) = 1 indicates that subcarrier n is assigned to trans-
mit the symbols for the tiles in Si(X), and µn,i(X, H) = 0
otherwise. For ease of implementation, assume each subcarrier
is assigned to transmit symbols for only one set of tiles. Thus,
we have the following subcarrier allocation constraints:

µn,i(X, H) ∈ {0, 1}, i ∈ I(X), n ∈ N ,

(1)

i∈I(X)

µn,i(X, H) = 1, n ∈ N .

(2)
Let pn,i(X, H) and cn,i(X, H) denote the transmission
power and transmission rate for the symbols for the tiles in
Si(X) on subcarrier n, respectively, where

X

pn,i(X, H) ≥ 0, i ∈ I(X), n ∈ N ,

(3)

2Note that the proposed framework does not rely on any particular method

for determining the set of tiles to be transmitted to each user

[1].

3This will lead to a great computational complexity reduction for optimal

multicast of tiled 360 VR video, compared with [5].

4Note that the proposed optimization framework is general and can be
applied to optimally multicast multiple messages to different groups of users,
i.e., multi-group multicast, in OFDMA systems.

Thus, the total transmission power is P (µ(X, H), p(X, H)) =
i∈I(X) µn,i(X, H)pn,i(X, H). To obtain design in-
sights, we consider capacity achieving code. Consequently, to

Given the video quality (i.e., encoding rate of each tile D),

we would like to minimize the transmission power.

Problem 1 is a mixed discrete-continuous optimization
problem. The number of variables of Problem 1 (proportional
to the number of sets of tiles I(X)) is much smaller than that
in [5] (proportional to the number of tiles to be transmitted to
all users |Φ(X)|), as I(X) is much smaller than |Φ(X)|.

B. Optimal Solution

In this part, we obtain a globally optimal solution of Prob-
lem 1 (under a mild condition). First, to reduce computational
complexity, we eliminate c(X, H) and simplify the constraints
in (4), (5) and (6) to

A. Problem Formulation

Let ¯P denote the transmission power budget of the system.

Consider the maximum transmission power constraint:
P (µ(X, H), p(X, H)) ≤ ¯P , (X, H) ∈ X × H.

(11)
To guarantee user experience, the encoding rate should not
change as frequently as the viewing directions and channel
states, and should remain constant within a certain time
duration. Given the transmission power budget ¯P , we would
like to maximize the received video quality (i.e., encoding
rate of each tile D). Denote µ , (µ(X, H))(X,H)∈X ×H,
p , (p(X, H))(X,H)∈X ×H and c , (c(X, H))(X,H)∈X ×H.

V. SIMULATION

In this section, we compare the proposed solutions in
Section III and Section IV with two baselines using numerical
results. Baseline 1 considers serving each user separately using
unicast in an optimal way, similar to the proposed solutions.
Baseline 2 considers multicast but with equal subcarrier al-
location for each transmitted tile and optimal transmission
power as well as transmission rate allocation based on the
equal subcarrier allocation. In the simulation, we use Kvazaar
as the 360 VR video encoder and video sequence Boxing as
the video source. To avoid view switch delay, we transmit extra
15◦ in the four directions of each requested FoV [1]. Different
360 VR videos in general have different popularity distribu-
tions for viewing directions. To illustrate the importance of
the concentration of the viewing directions, we assume all
users randomly and independently select viewing directions
according to Zipf distribution5 for the Mh × Mv viewing
directions. In particular, suppose viewing direction (mh, mv)
is of rank (mh − 1)Mv + mv and Pr[Xk = (mh, mv)] =
((mh−1)Mv +mv )−γ
i−γ , where γ is the Zipf exponent. In addition,
Pi=1,...,MhMv
Hn,k, n ∈ N , k ∈ K are randomly and indepen-
assume
dently distributed according to CN (0, 1
d ), where d reﬂects the
path loss. We randomly choose 100 global channel states to
form H, and evaluate the average transmission power over H.
Fig. 2 (a) illustrates the average transmission power versus
the Zipf exponent γ. We can see that the average transmission

p

5Zipf distribution is widely used to model content popularity in Internet and
wireless networks. For any popularity rank, a larger Zipf exponent γ indicates
i,e, higher concentration of
a smaller tail of the popularity distribution,
requests for contents. Here, we adopt Zipf distribution for ease of exposition.

power of each multicast scheme decreases with γ, as multicast
opportunities increase with γ; the average transmission power
of the unicast scheme almost does not change with γ, as it
does not capture multicast opportunities. Fig. 2 (b) illustrates
the encoding rate of each tile versus γ. We can see that the
encoding rate of each tile of each scheme does not change
with γ, as that of each multicast scheme is determined by
i∈I(X) Si(X) corresponding to the case with
argmaxX∈X
the fewest multicast opportunities, and that of the unicast
scheme does not depend on X. From Fig. 2, we can also ob-
serve that the proposed solutions outperform the two baselines.
Speciﬁcally, the gains of the proposed solutions over Base-
line 1 arise from the fact that the proposed solutions utilize
multicast. The gains of the proposed solutions over Baseline 2
are due to the fact that the proposed solutions carefully allocate
subcarrier, transmission power and transmission rate.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this letter, we studied optimal multicast of tiled 360 VR
video in an OFDMA system, and formulated two non-convex
optimization problems, i.e., the minimization of the average
transmission power for given video quality, and the maximiza-
tion of the received video quality for given transmission power
budget. We obtained a globally optimal closed-form solution
and a near optimal solution of the two non-convex problems,
separately, and revealed important design insights for tiled 360
VR multicast. This letter opens up several directions for future
research. For instance, the proposed multicast mechanism and
optimization framework can be extended to design optimal
multi-quality multicast of tiled 360 VR video in OFDMA
systems. In addition, a possible direction for future research
is to design optimal single-quality or multi-quality multicast
of tiled 360 VR video in different wireless systems.
