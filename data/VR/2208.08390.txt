ABSTRACT

The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of several
auditory feedback modalities on gait (i.e., walking patterns) in virtual
reality (VR). Prior research has substantiated gait disturbances in
VR users as one of the primary obstacles to VR usability. However,
minimal research has been done to mitigate this issue. We recruited
39 participants (with mobility impairments: 18, without mobility
impairments: 21) who completed timed walking tasks in a real-world
environment and the same tasks in a VR environment with various
types of auditory feedback. Within-subject results showed that each
auditory condition signiﬁcantly improved gait performance while
in VR (p < .001) compared to the no auditory condition in VR for
both groups of participants with and without mobility impairments.
Moreover, spatial audio improved gait performance signiﬁcantly (p
< .001) compared to other auditory conditions for both groups of
participants. This research could help to make walking in VR more
accessible for people with and without mobility impairments.

1 INTRODUCTION

Virtual reality (VR) technology has a wide variety of applications
(e.g., education, physical ﬁtness, rehabilitation, entertainment).
However, VR causes gait (i.e., walking patterns) disturbance in
most users, which limits the usability and beneﬁts of VR [7, 22, 27].
This problem is especially severe for persons with mobility impair-
ments (MI) as these populations have functional gait disorders, and
further gait disturbance in VR makes it increasingly difﬁcult for
them to use VR technologies. For example, persons with mobility
impairments may ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to perform various locomotor
movements in VR without the risk of falling or injury. However,
minimal research has been conducted to mitigate these challenges.
Outside of VR research, the ﬁeld of assistive technologies has
shown that some multimodal feedback techniques [23, 64] can im-
prove gait and balance and support individuals with MI during daily
activities. For example, assistive technology based on vibrotac-
tile [43] and visual feedback has been applied in studies aimed at im-
proving balance and gait for persons with disabilities [10, 69, 71, 72].
Similarly, auditory feedback in a non-VR environment has also im-
proved gait in some prior studies. For example, Baram et al. [8]
reported that walking velocity and stride length improved signiﬁ-
cantly in a non-VR environment using auditory feedback compared

to baseline for participants with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However,
the application of auditory feedback on gait and balance performance
in VR has not been thoroughly explored.

To investigate solutions to the gait disturbance issue, we con-
ducted empirical studies applying various auditory feedback tech-
niques (e.g., spatial, static rest frame, and rhythmic audio) in VR for
participants with and without MI. Participants performed a timed
walking task using a pressure-sensitive walkway for quantitative gait
analysis - GAITRite. In our study, all auditory conditions improved
gait parameters signiﬁcantly whereas spatial audio outperformed
others. The purpose of this study was to make immersive VR more
accessible using auditory feedback and analyzing its inﬂuence on
gait performance while in VR. However, we did not measure post-
study effects on gait performance.

2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK

2.1 Gait Disturbance in VR

VR has been shown to induce instability and gait disturbance in prior
studies. Research published in 2001 reported that balance in VR was
impaired [70]. Individuals using HMDs can lose stability due to end-
to-end latency and illusory impressions of body movement generated
by VR because HMDs obstruct visual feedback from the real world
[45, 65]. Prolonged engagement in VR also resulted in postural
instability [49]. These postural instabilities caused by VR can induce
gait instability while walking in a virtual environment (VE) [32].
Riem et al. [56] also reported signiﬁcant disturbance of step length
(p < .05) in VR compared to baseline. Other studies have also
explored the impact of imbalance on gait disturbance [66]. Horsak
et al. recruited 21 participants (male: 9, female:12, age: 37.62 ± 8.55
years) to see if walking in an HMD-based VE has a signiﬁcant impact
on gait [34]. Walking speed was reduced by 7.3% in HMD-based VE
in their study. Canessa et al. also investigated the difference between
real-world walking and immersive VR walking using an HMD [11].
They reported that walking velocity decreased signiﬁcantly (p <
.05) in immersive VE compared to real-world walking. Also, most
prior studies concentrated on participants without MI [20, 33, 40,
57, 61] For example, Martelli et al. [44] investigated whether gaits
change during overground walking in a VE while using a VR HMD
with continuous multidirectional visual ﬁeld perturbations. In four
different settings, 12 healthy young adults walked for six minutes
on a pathway. Reduced stride length, greater stride width, and
higher stride variability were observed when the visual ﬁeld was
perturbed. However, there have been very few attempts in the past
to address gait disturbance in VR. This inspired us to investigate the
gait disturbance issue to make walking in VR more accessible.

2.2 Gait Improvement After VR Intervention

Although the focus of our research is VR accessibility and gait
improvement while in VR, it is important to review how VR re-
habilitation applications have previously facilitated balance and
gait improvement that persists after the VR experience is over
[9, 14, 17, 19, 47, 52]. For example, Walker et al. [73] recruited
seven post-stroke patients with MI to investigate the improvement
in walking and balance abilities using a low-cost VR system. They
designed the VE to provide participants the sensation of walking
along a city street, which was displayed via a television screen in

 
 
 
 
 
 
front of a treadmill. They collected postural feedback via a head-
mounted position sensor. An overhead suspension harness supported
all participants. Six participants (mean age 53.5y, range 49–62y)
completed the study. Results suggested signiﬁcant improvement (p
< .05) in post-study balance, walking speed, and gait functionality.
Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score improved by 10%, walking speed
improved by 38%, and Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) score
increased by 30% compared to baseline in their study. However,
the majority of the prior work in VR gait rehabilitation did not use
HMDs. We used HMDs to render the VEs in our study.

2.3 The Effects of HMDs on Persons With Gait Distur-

bance

Winter et al. [75] recruited 36 (Male: 10, Female: 26) participants
without MI and 14 participants with MI (MS: 10, Stroke: 4) to
investigate the effect of an immersive, semi-immersive, and no VR
environment on gait during treadmill training. First, participants
completed the treadmill training without VR. Then, they experienced
a virtual walking path displayed via a monitor in the semi-immersive
VR condition. They experienced the same VR scenario via HMD
in the immersive VR condition. Experimental results showed that
immersive VR during gait rehabilitation increased walking speed
more signiﬁcantly (p < .001) than semi-immersive and no VR con-
ditions for participants with and without MI. Participants did not
experience cybersickness or a signiﬁcant increase in heart rate after
the VR conditions.

Janeh et al. recruited 15 male patients with Parkinson’s disease to
investigate a VR-based gait manipulation approach aimed at achiev-
ing gait symmetry by adjusting step length [35]. They compared
natural gait with walking circumstances during VR-based gait ma-
nipulation activities utilizing visual or proprioceptive signals. VR
manipulation activities enhanced step width and swing time as com-
pared to natural gait. Janeh et al. also reported VR as a promising
and potentially beneﬁcial tool for improving the gait of persons with
neurological disorders after VR experience. They stressed the sig-
niﬁcance of using virtual walking approaches in rehabilitation [36].
Also, Guo et al. [28] investigated the effect of VEs on gait for both
participants with and without MI. They reported that MI participants
responded differently in terms of walking velocity, step length, and
stride length. However, there was no signiﬁcant difference for other
gait parameters between participants with and without MI.

Ferdous et al. [22] investigated the effect of HMDs and visual
components on postural stability in VR for participants with MS.
However, they did not investigate the effect on gait, which is the
case of most prior studies in immersive VR with HMDs. As a result,
the impacts of immersive VR with HMDs on gait parameters have
not received enough attention, prompting us to look into the effect
on gait in VEs with HMDs for people with and without disabilities.

2.4 Non-VR Assistive Technology: Auditory Feedback
for Gait and Balance Improvement in Real World

Prior research in non-VR environments found that auditory feedback
can greatly improve postural control in the real world, although it
is considered less effective than visual feedback techniques [24].
Auditory feedback based on the user’s lateral trunk lean helped
to maintain postural stability [13]. Spatial audio - audio that is
localized in 3D by the user - was effective in preserving postural
stability [25,68]. Static rest frame audio - white noise that is uniform
and continuous - was found to reduce postural instability in older
adults [16, 58]. People having mobility impairments (e.g., people
with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s) and the elderly improved gait
using rhythmic audio (hearing a consistent beat) [26]. Maculewicz
et al. also investigated different rhythmic auditory feedback patterns
[41]. They reported a signiﬁcant increase in walking speed (p <
.001) with the rhythmic auditory feedback compared to the without
auditory feedback condition. However, spatial audio was employed

more frequently than other auditory approaches since it is claimed
to be more natural and realistic [15, 53]. However, these studies
investigated the auditory feedback in non-VR settings whereas we
investigated the effect of auditory feedback on gait improvement in
VR settings.

2.5 Auditory Feedback in VR and the Effect on Gait
Limited research has been done to investigate the effect of auditory
feedback on gait and balance in VR. Mahmud et al. [42] investigated
different auditory feedback to mitigate imbalance issue in VR. They
observed that all auditory feedback improved balance signiﬁcantly
for both participants with and without MS while spatial audio out-
performed others. Gandemer et al. studied persons with low vision
and found that spatial audio in an immersive VE enhanced gait and
balance [25]. In most cases, spatial audio was favored for usage in
VR because it gave more immersion [42,50,74]. However, the effect
of various auditory feedback on VR walking has been minimally
studied [51]. This inspired us to explore the impact of spatial, static
rest frame, and rhythmic auditory feedback on gait in VR with a
speciﬁc focus on persons with gait-related disabilities.

3 METHODS
3.1 Hypotheses
The impact of three auditory techniques (spatial, static rest frame,
and rhythmic) on gait parameters in a VR environment was ex-
plored in this study. Spatial [25, 42], Static rest frame [16, 58],
rhythmic [26] auditory feedback types were found to be effective
in previous literature in VR and non-VR settings, which motivated
us to choose these auditory feedback conditions. These hypotheses
were largely motivated by the literature on gait disturbances in VR
and non-VR auditory techniques to improve gait in the real world
(see Background and Related Work).

H1: Gait disturbances will happen in VR baseline without audi-
tory techniques as compared to the non-VR baseline without auditory
techniques.

H2: Three VR-based auditory techniques (spatial, static rest
frame, and rhythmic) will improve gait parameters more than the
no-audio in VR condition.

H3: Spatial audio technique will improve gait parameters more

than static rest frame and rhythmic audio techniques.

H4: Gait improvement (e.g., velocity) might be more apparent in

participants with MI than participants without MI.

3.2 Participants, Selection Criteria, and Screening Pro-

cess

We recruited 39 participants (Male: 9, Female: 30) from various
multiple sclerosis support groups and the local community using
a matched-comparison group design to investigate gait improve-
ment using auditory feedback in VR. Of these, eighteen participants
(Male: 5, Female: 13) had MI due to multiple sclerosis. 52.4% of
the participants with MI identiﬁed as White, 28.6% identiﬁed as
Hispanic, and 23.8% identiﬁed as African American. In addition,
we recruited a group of twenty-one participants without MI (Male:
4, Female: 17). 19% of the participants without MI were White,
52.4% were Hispanic, 28.6% were African American, 9.5% were
American Indian, and 9.5% were Asian. Both participant groups
were statistically comparable in age, height, and weight. Table 1
displays participants’ mean (SD) age, height, weight, and gender
characteristics for both participant groups. We excluded participants
with cognitive impairments, severely low vision, cardiovascular or
respiratory conditions, or the inability to walk without assistance.
The main challenge for this study was to recruit participants with
MS.

Screening Process: Participants were recruited through tele-
phone calls, email lists, and ﬂyers. Pre-screening was conducted
over the telephone to determine participants’ eligibility. We inquired

about general demographic information, health, and medical-related
history to address participant inclusion or exclusion from the study.
For example, we conﬁrmed the individual’s ability to visit the on-
campus lab and participate through the duration of the study. We also
assessed participants’ history of MI and their ability to walk without
assistance. We minimized participant characteristic imbalances and
ensured age, height, and weight were proportionally similar between
both participant groups.

3.3 System Description

The following equipment was used in the study for participants’
safety and data collection.

Computers, VR Equipment, and Software: The VEs were de-
veloped using Unity3D software. We used an HTC Vive wireless
HMD which has a pixel resolution of 2160 x 1200, 90 Hz refresh
rate, and a 110-degree ﬁeld of view. We used the integrated HMD
headphones to apply the auditory feedback techniques. We used a
computer to render the VE with speciﬁcations including a Windows
10 operating system, an Intel Core i7 Processor (4.20 GHz), 32GB
DDR3 RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card.

Safety Equipment: We used a Kaye Products Inc. suspension
walking system which consisted of a body harness, thigh cuffs, and
suspension walker for the safety of the participants during the study.
Gait Analysis: A GAITRite walkway system was used to collect
participants’ gait parameters. The GAITRite walkway system is a
portable 12 ft. pressure sensor pad capable of providing spatial and
temporal gait parameters of participants during a walking task.

Environment: The study was conducted in a controlled envi-
ronment (> 600sq ft.). We conducted each study with only the
participant and researcher in the room in order to minimize any
ambient noises or other disturbances. Fig. 1 shows the comparison
between the real-world environment and the virtual environment for
the timed walking task.

3.4 Study Conditions

We applied three VR-based auditory feedback techniques and one
condition with no audio in order to observe the effect of these feed-
back techniques on an individual’s gait performance. We played
these feedback conditions at the start of the tasks through the HMD’s
integrated headphones. We employed white noise for auditory feed-
back because it had been found to improve gait and balance per-
formance due to stochastic resonance phenomena [31]. In prior
research in the real world, auditory white noise was also found to be
beneﬁcial in minimizing postural instability [16, 29, 59, 60, 76]. The
study conditions were:

3.4.1 Non-VR Baseline

We measured the baseline data while participants performed the
timed walking task using the GAITRite system without any auditory
feedback.

3.4.2 VR Baseline

We performed the same timed walking task in VR but with no
auditory feedback to establish a VR baseline measurement for par-

Figure 1: Comparison between real environment (top) and virtual
environment (bottom) for timed walking task

ticipants. Participants performed this condition while wearing the
HMD and integrated headphones.

3.4.3 Auditory VR Feedback
We applied the following three auditory conditions in VR.

Spatial Audio: This was 3D auditory feedback in relation to the
participant’s physical position in the lab. This was simulated spatial
audio (rather than recorded ambisonic audio). In particular, we
played spatialized white noise from Unity3D such that when the
user rotated their head, the noise played at varying levels in each
ear to imitate a stationary sound source. We used Google resonance
audio SDK to implement this because the plugin utilizes head-related
transfer functions (HRTFs) to simulate 3D sound more accurately
than unity’s default [5]. The 3D audio source in the VE had X, Y,
and Z coordinates of 0, 0, and 0, respectively.

Static Rest Frame Audio: This auditory feedback was continuous
white noise that was not relative to the participants positioning in the
lab. Participants heard the noise at the same intensity in both ears
all the time for this condition which is similar to a ”mono” sample
with no panning. In previous non-VR research, this strategy was
also shown to enhance adult participants’ balance. [16, 58].

Rhythmic Audio: The white noise was similar to the static rest
frame, but it was a white noise clip at every one-second interval. The
length of the rhythmic audio clip was also one-second. Previous re-
search revealed that hearing a constant rhythm may enhance balance
and walking in persons with neurological disorders and the adults in
non-VR settings [26].

3.5 Auditory Feedback Design
In Unity3D, we connected the audio to sound sources and modiﬁed
them to ﬁt our research needs. We had a different Unity scene for
each auditory feedback circumstance. When the participant was
ready, we started each condition with the relevant scene to start the
auditory feedback. We performed the scenes for all participants
in counterbalanced order, which assigned the auditory feedback in
different orders for different participants. We used counterbalancing
as it reduces carryover and fatigue effects [1–3]. The audio was
delivered over the wireless HMD’s embedded headphones at the
start of the task. The loudness of the audio was adjusted to the
participant’s satisfaction.

3.6 Study Procedure

The ﬂowchart in Fig. 2 represents the whole study procedure.

Figure 3: Participants were supported by a harness while they per-
formed the timed walking task using the GAITRite system in real world
(left, face blurred) and virtual environment (right)

were told to walk on the virtual GAITRite overlaid on top of a real
GAITRite. They used an HMD to observe the VE and the integrated
HMD’s headphones to hear the auditory feedback. Participants’ per-
formed three timed walking tasks in VR for each auditory condition
(e.g., spatial, static rest frame, and rhythmic) and a no-audio in VR
condition. The four conditions were applied in counterbalanced
order for all participants. Fig. 3 (right) shows an example of a
participant’s timed walking task in the virtual environment in our
study.

Figure 2: Study procedure

3.6.3 Post-Study Questionnaires

First, we sanitized all lab equipment used in the study (e.g., HMD,
controllers, balance board, safety harness, and suspension system).
We recorded participants’ temperature upon entry to the lab and
completed a COVID-19 symptom screening questionnaire form. We
then informed participants of the study procedures and documented
formal participant consent. Participants completed an Activities-
speciﬁc Balance Conﬁdence (ABC) [55] form and a Simulator Sick-
ness Questionnaire (SSQ) form [38] at the beginning of the study.
Participants were asked to remove footwear that would interfere
with the GAITRite. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the
University of Texas at San Antonio approved our study protocols.

3.6.1 Real World Walking

We used the GAITRite to measure gait parameters in the study. Par-
ticipants were securely fastened to the safety harness and suspension
walker to prevent fall-related injuries. We instructed the participants
to walk at a comfortable speed on the GAITRite. We also instructed
them to complete 180 degree turns at both ends. Participants took
their feet off the GAITRite while taking turns - the GAITRite soft-
ware requires participants to step off between trials; moreover, the
GAITRite can not technically assess turns. Participants performed
three timed walking tasks [67] while we timed them using a stop-
watch and collected their gait data with our GAITRite. Fig. 3
(left) shows an example of a participant’s timed walking task in the
real-world environment in our study.

3.6.2 Virtual Environment Walking

This was the replication of the task in the real-world environment,
except it was performed in a VE with various auditory feedback
conditions. We used the same harness and suspension system as the
real-world environment walking to prevent sudden falls. Participants

Participants completed a post-study SSQ form and a demographic
questionnaire. Finally, each participant received compensation of
$30/Hr and a parking validation ticket at the end of the study.

4 METRICS
4.1 Gait Metrics
We investigated the following gait metrics in our study.
- Walking Velocity: The distance traveled (cm) divided by ambulation
time (sec).
- Cadence: The number of footsteps per minute.
- Step Time (Left/Right): The time (sec) between the initial contact
points of the opposite foot.
- Step Length (Left/Right): The distance (cm) between heel centers
of two consecutive steps of opposing feet.
- Cycle Time (Left/Right): The time (sec) between the initial contact
points of two consecutive steps of the same foot.
- Stride Length (Left/Right): The distance (cm) between the steps of
the same foot.
- Swing Time (Left/Right): The time (sec) between the ﬁnal contact
point of a foot and the initial contact point of the same foot.
- Stance Time (Left/Right): The time (sec) between the initial contact
point and the ﬁnal contact point of the same footstep.
- Single Support Time (Left/Right): This is the time (sec) between the
current footfall’s last contact and the ﬁrst contact of the next footfall
of the same foot. The single support time is equal to the opposing
foot’s swing time.
- Double Support Time (Left/Right): The time (sec) that both feet are
in contact with the ground.
- Base of Support (Left/Right): The width between one foot and the
line of progression of the opposite footstep. The line of progression
is a line that connects the heels of two footsteps of the same foot.
- Toe-In/Toe-Out (Left/Right): The angle (degrees) between the line

of progression and the center-line of a footprint. Toe-in indicates
the center-line of the footprint is inside the line of progression. Toe-
out indicates the center-line of the footprint is outside the line of
progression.
More information on gait parameters can be found in the GAITRite
manual [4].

4.2 Activities-speciﬁc Balance Conﬁdence (ABC) Scale

The Activities-speciﬁc Balance Conﬁdence (ABC) Scale is an out-
come measure questionnaire used to assess participant balance, mo-
bility, and physical functioning. The questionnaire uses 16 items
to measure an individual’s conﬁdence while performing everyday
activities without losing balance [55]. Participants are asked to rate
their conﬁdence in each speciﬁc activity on a scale of 0% (not conﬁ-
dent) to 100% (most conﬁdent). The ABC Scale score is calculated
by the sum of the ratings (0-1600), divided by 16. A low level of
functioning is indicated by a total ABC score below 50. A moderate
level of functioning is indicated by a total ABC score between 50-80,
and a high level of functioning is indicated by a total score above
80.

4.3 Simulator Sickness Questionnaire

The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) is used to measure
the severity of cybersickness produced by exposure to virtual envi-
ronments. The SSQ assesses participant physiological discomfort
due to cybersickness using 16 symptoms in three different cate-
gories [38]. The categories include nausea, oculomotor disturbance,
and disorientation.

5 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

A Shapiro-Wilk test was applied for testing data normality for each
gait parameter separately. Results indicated the normal distribution
of data ( p > .05) for all gait parameters for both groups of partici-
pants. To discover any signiﬁcant difference among study conditions,
we used a 2×5 mixed-model ANOVA with Bonferroni correction
where we had one between-subject factor with two levels (partici-
pants with MI and participants without MI) and one within-subject
factor with ﬁve levels (ﬁve study conditions: baseline, spatial, static,
rhythmic, and no audio). When we found a signiﬁcant difference,
we used post hoc two-tailed paired sample t-tests to obtain the dif-
ference between two particular study conditions for within-subject
comparisons and to investigate hypotheses H1, H2, and H3. To
investigate hypothesis H4, we also used post hoc two-tailed t-tests
between the two groups for between-subject comparisons. To assess
the difference in physical ability, we used post hoc two-tailed t-tests
between the ABC scores of both groups of participants. We also
performed two-tailed paired sample t-tests between pre-session SSQ
score and post-session SSQ score for both groups of participants
separately to analyze cybersickness. Bonferroni correction was used
for all tests that included multiple comparisons.

6 RESULTS

Among the twelve investigated gait parameters, we found signiﬁcant
improvement in seven gait parameters (walking velocity, cadence,
step length, stride length, step time, cycle time, and swing time) for
different audio conditions and the improvement of the other ﬁve gait
parameters were not signiﬁcant for both groups of participants. Gait
improvement also differed signiﬁcantly depending on the auditory
feedback conditions. We computed the gait parameters from the
beginning to the end of the trials (not any speciﬁc portion of the
trials). Also, we analyzed both left and right leg data. However,
there was no signiﬁcant difference between left and right leg data.
Therefore, we reported the averaged data of the left and right leg for
all gait parameters for simplicity.

We found a signiﬁcant difference in walking velocity after con-
ducting the mixed-model ANOVA test for all participants, F(1,123)

= 71.6, p < .001; and effect size, η 2 = 0.09. We also found a sig-
niﬁcant difference (p < .001) in cadence, step length, stride length,
step time, cycle time, swing time. Next, we conducted the follow-
ing post-hoc two-tailed t-tests for within-group and between-group
comparisons to ﬁnd differences between particular study conditions.

6.1 Within-Group Comparisons
6.1.1 Non-VR Baseline vs. VR Baseline
For participants with MI, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in walking
velocity in VR baseline without audio condition (Mean, M = 60.09,
Standard Deviation, SD = 18.97) as compared to non-VR baseline
without audio condition (M = 62.49, SD = 18.81); t(17) = 3.94, p
< .001; and effect size, Cohen’s d = 0.12. For participants without
MI, there was also a signiﬁcant decrease in walking velocity in
VR baseline without audio condition (M = 78.79, SD = 16.31), as
compared to the non-VR baseline without audio condition (M =
80.96, SD = 14.73); t(20) = 0.64, p < .001, d = 0.13. For both
groups of participants, we also observed a signiﬁcant decrease (p
< .001) in cadence, step length, and stride length for VR baseline
without audio condition whereas step time, cycle time, and swing
time were signiﬁcantly increased (p < .001) in VR baseline without
audio condition as compared to non-VR baseline without audio
condition. This result indicated gait disturbance in VR environments
for both participants with and without MI.

6.1.2 Spatial Audio vs. VR Baseline
For participants with MI, experimental results revealed that walking
velocity increased signiﬁcantly more in the spatial audio condition
(M = 75.16, SD = 21.3) as compared to VR baseline without audio
condition (M = 60.09, SD = 18.97); t(17) = 7.33, p < .001, d = 0.75.
For participants without MI, walking velocity increased signiﬁcantly
more in the spatial audio condition (M = 90.35, SD = 15.11) as
compared to VR baseline without audio condition (M = 78.79, SD =
16.31); t(20) = 4.72, p < .001, d = 0.74. For both participants with
and without MI, we observed a signiﬁcant increase (p < .001) in
cadence, step length, and stride length for spatial audio condition
as compared to VR baseline without audio condition. Also, there
was a signiﬁcant decrease in step time, cycle time, and swing time
(p < .001) in spatial audio condition as compared to VR baseline
without audio condition for both groups. This result substantiated
that spatial audio improved gait parameters than the VR baseline
without audio condition for both group of participants.

6.1.3 Spatial Audio vs. Static Rest Frame Audio
For participants with MI, spatial audio condition increased walking
velocity (M = 75.16, SD = 21.3) comparative to static rest frame
audio condition (M = 70.07, SD = 18.5); t(17) = 2.93, p < .001,
d = 0.26. For participants without MI, walking velocity increased
signiﬁcantly more in spatial audio condition (M = 90.35, SD = 15.11)
as compared to static rest frame audio condition (M = 84.76, SD
= 13.78); t(20) = 3.61, p < .001, d = 0.39. For both participants
with and without MI, we found a signiﬁcant increase (p < .001) in
cadence, step length, and stride length for spatial audio condition
compared to static rest frame audio condition. Also, step time, cycle
time,and swing time were signiﬁcantly decreased (p < .001) in the
spatial audio condition as compared to the static rest frame audio
condition for both groups. Thus, spatial audio condition had better
performance concerning gait than the static rest frame audio for
participants with and without MI.

6.1.4 Spatial Audio vs. Rhythmic Audio
For participants with MI, walking velocity increased signiﬁcantly
more in spatial audio condition (M = 75.16, SD = 21.3) as compared
to rhythmic audio condition (M = 67.5, SD = 20.63); t(17) = 4.9,
p < .001, d = 0.37. For participants without MI, walking velocity
increased signiﬁcantly more in the spatial audio condition (M =
90.35, SD = 15.11) as compared to the rhythmic audio condition
(M = 82.66, SD = 15.69); t(20) = 3.29, p < .001, d = 0.5. For
both group of participants, there was a signiﬁcant increase (p <
.001) in cadence, step length, and stride length for spatial audio
condition as compared to the rhythmic audio condition. However,
step time, cycle time, and swing time were signiﬁcantly decreased (p
< .001) in spatial audio condition than rhythmic audio condition for
both groups. These results suggest that spatial audio may be more
effective than rhythmic audio for gait performance.

6.1.5 Static Rest Frame Audio vs. VR Baseline
For participants with MI, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in
walking velocity in static rest frame audio condition (M = 70.07,
SD = 18.5) comparative to VR baseline without audio condition
(M = 60.09, SD = 18.97); t(17) = 8.2, p < .001, d = 0.57. For
participants without MI, there was a signiﬁcant increase in walking
velocity in static rest frame audio condition (M = 84.76, SD =
13.78) as compared to VR baseline without audio condition (M =
78.79, SD = 16.31); t(20) = 3.89, p < .001, d = 0.4. For both
participants with and without MI, there was a signiﬁcant increase (p
< .001) in cadence, step length, and stride length as compared to VR
baseline without audio condition. However, step time, cycle time,

and swing time were signiﬁcantly decreased (p < .001) in static
rest frame audio condition as compared to VR baseline without
audio condition for both groups. As a result, static rest frame audio
provided better performance than VR baseline without no audio
condition in reference to gait behavior.

6.1.6 Static Rest Frame Audio vs. Rhythmic Audio

For participants with MI, there was no signiﬁcant difference in walk-
ing velocity between static rest frame audio condition (M = 70.07,
SD = 18.5) and rhythmic audio condition (M = 67.5, SD = 20.63);
t(17) = 1.89, p = .06, d = 0.13 after post-hoc two-tailed paired t-test.
For participants without MI, we did not observe a signiﬁcant differ-
ence in walking velocity between static rest frame audio condition
(M = 84.76, SD = 13.78) and rhythmic audio condition (M = 82.66,
SD = 15.69); t(20) = 1.11, p = .138, d = 0.14. Similarly for both
participants with and without MI, we did not observe any signiﬁcant
differences for other gait parameters between static rest frame audio
condition and rhythmic audio condition. Hence, it was inconclusive
which audio can be preferred between rhythmic and static rest frame
for increasing gait performance.

6.1.7 Rhythmic Audio vs. VR Baseline

For participants with MI, tests revealed that walking velocity in-
creased signiﬁcantly more in rhythmic audio condition (M = 67.5,
SD = 20.63) as compared to VR baseline without audio condition
(M = 60.09, SD = 18.97); t(17) = 5.63, p < .001, d = 0.37. For
participants without MI, results indicated a signiﬁcant difference in
walking velocity between rhythmic audio condition (M = 82.66, SD
= 15.69) and VR baseline without audio condition (M = 78.79, SD =
16.31); t(20) = 2.01, p < .001, d = 0.24. For both groups, cadence,
step length, and stride length signiﬁcantly increased (p < .001) in
rhythmic audio condition as compared to VR baseline without audio
condition. However, step time, cycle time, and swing time were
signiﬁcantly decreased (p < .001) in rhythmic audio condition as
compared to VR baseline without audio condition for both groups.
Thus, rhythmic auditory condition surpassed VR baseline condition
for gait improvement.

The comparisons of walking velocity between ﬁve different study
conditions have been shown in Figure 4 (participants with MI) and
Figure 5 (participants without MI). The other gait parameters which
resulted in signiﬁcant improvement have been shown in Table 2
(participants with MI) and Table 3 (Participants without MI) with
their respective mean and standard deviation (SD) in the ﬁve study
conditions. The comparisons of effect size (Cohen’s d) for walking

velocity between different study conditions have been shown in
Figure 6.

participants without MI.

study conditions for participants with and without MI.

6.2 Between-Group Comparisons

We found a signiﬁcant decrease in walking velocity for participants
with MI compared to participants without MI for non-VR baseline
condition; t(37) = 3.37, p = .002; d = 1.1 and for VR baseline
condition; t(37) = 3.27, p = .003; d = 1.06. Results also revealed
a signiﬁcant decrease in walking velocity for participants with MI
as compared to participants without MI for all VR-based auditory
feedback conditions: spatial audio (t(37) = 2.53, p = .02; d = 0.83),
static rest frame audio (t(37) = 2.77, p = .009; d = 0.91), and for
rhythmic audio (t(37) = 2.55, p = .01; d = 0.84). For all conditions
(non-VR baseline, VR baseline, spatial audio, static rest frame audio,
and rhythmic audio), we also obtained a signiﬁcant decrease (p <
.05) in cadence, step length, and stride length for participants with
MI than participants without MI.

6.3 Activities-speciﬁc Balance Conﬁdence (ABC) Scale

We conducted a two-tailed t-test based on responses from the
Activities-speciﬁc Balance Conﬁdence (ABC) Scale between partic-
ipants with MI (M = 70.83, SD = 24.83) and participants without MI
(M = 91.76, SD = 13.71), t(37) = 3.38, p < .001, d = 1.04. The cal-
culated mean ABC Scale score for participants with MI was 70.83%,
which indicated a moderate level of functioning. However, the cal-
culated mean ABC score was 91.76% for participants without MI.
This indicated a high level of functioning. These scores represented
a signiﬁcant difference in physical functioning between participants
with and without MI.

6.4 Simulator Sickness Questionnaire

We conducted a two-tailed t-test between pre-study SSQ scores
and post-study SSQ scores for both participant groups. We did not
observe a signiﬁcant increase in SSQ scores for both participants
with and without MI. We obtained t(17) = 1.71, p = .07, d = 0.2 for
participants with MI and t(20) = 1.72, p = .06, d = 0.1 for participants
without MI.

7 DISCUSSION

7.1 Gait disturbance in VR Without Audio

Based on the results from Mixed ANOVA and post hoc t-tests for
both groups of participants, we found that participants’ walking
velocity, step length, stride length, cadence, step time, cycle time,
and swing time were signiﬁcantly affected in VR-baseline without
audio condition compared to the non-VR baseline without audio
condition. Therefore, we noticed that gait disturbance happened
in VR conditions for all participants when there was no auditory
feedback, which supported our hypothesis H1. Prior works also
reported that VR might cause postural instability, which could lead
to gait disturbance [32, 56, 66].

7.2 Gait Improvement in VR-based Auditory Conditions

In all VR-based auditory conditions, results showed that cadence,
step length, stride length increased whereas step time, cycle time,
swing time decreased. That is, participants had more steps and bigger
steps in a shorter amount of time in VR-based auditory conditions as
compared to the VR no-audio baseline. Thus, walking velocity was
increased in all VR-based auditory conditions (Figure 4 and Figure
5) signiﬁcantly more (p < .001) than VR baseline condition for both
participants with and without MI, which validated our hypothesis
H2. Also, the value of effect size (Cohen’s d) = 0.5 indicated that
Spatial audio had a medium effect on both groups of participants.
Static rest frame audio had a medium effect on participants with MI
but a small effect on participants without MI. Rhythmic audio had a
small effect on both groups of participants. Because of the auditory
feedback effects, the gait parameters improved. Previous ﬁndings
substantiated these results where they reported auditory white noise
[29, 59, 60, 76], spatial [25, 68], static rest frame [58], CoP [30], and
rhythmic audio [26] improved gait and reduced postural sway in the
real-world environment. However, most of the previous works were
performed in non-VR settings while we investigated the effect of
auditory feedback in VR.

Among the VR-based auditory conditions, spatial audio outper-
formed (p < .001) other conditions, which supported our hypothesis
H3. Also, spatial audio had a greater effect size compared to other
auditory conditions (Fig. 6). This was also mentioned in previous
studies where spatial audio was reported to be effective in improving
gait and postural stability because it offered better ﬁdelity [15, 53]
and immersion [50, 74]. However, these studies only investigated
spatial audio, whereas we compared three different kinds of auditory
feedback in VR in this study.

7.3 Gait Similarities and Dissimilarities Between Partic-

ipants With and Without MI

We found signiﬁcant differences in walking velocity, cadence, step
length, stride length between the participants with and without MI
for all ﬁve study conditions. However, we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant
difference for other gait parameters between participants with and
without MI. Therefore, we found that few gait parameters (e.g.,
velocity, cadence, step length, stride length) were affected differently
for participants with MI and participants without MI, whereas other
gait parameters were affected in a similar way for both groups of
participants, which supported our hypothesis H4. These results
partially matched with previous work of Guo et al. [28] where they
investigated the gait parameters of participants with and without
MI in a VE. They found signiﬁcant differences in walking velocity,
step length, and stride length between participants with MI and
participants without MI, whereas there was no signiﬁcant differences
in other gait parameters of the two groups of participants.

To ﬁgure out how groups differed in gait improvement from the
audio conditions, we ﬁrst subtracted baseline data from all condi-
tions. Then, ANOVA and post hoc two-tailed t-tests between two
different groups revealed that gait improvement for participants with
MI was signiﬁcantly (p < .001) more than the participants without
MI. Effect size, Cohen’s d = 0.9, also indicated larger effect for
participants with MI. We hypothesized that as the participants with
MI had less gait functionality, there might have a chance for more
improvement than the participants without MI.

7.4 Cybersickness

Previous research had observed that VR users exposed to virtual
environments for more than 10 minutes could begin to experience
the onset of cybersickness [12, 39]. Our study required participants
to wear the HMD for around 45 minutes under several conditions,
which increased the chance of developing cybersickness symptoms.
However, we designed the virtual environment with no illusory self-
motion to minimize the possibility of participants developing cyber-
sickness [46]. We learned from the post-study verbal conversation
with the participants that a few experienced mild cybersickness after
the study, which only raised their post SSQ score slightly. Moreover,
there was no signiﬁcant difference between pre-SSQ and post-SSQ
scores. This suggests that cybersickness was negligible and did not
alter the participant’s gait performance.

8 LIMITATIONS

Both participant groups used a suspension walking system consisting
of a body harness and thigh cuffs for the duration of the timed
walking task. The walking system was used in the baseline condition
and all auditory feedback conditions in VR by every participant to
maintain study procedure consistency. Although participants were
instructed to walk at a comfortable speed, the heavy suspension
walking system could have reduced participants’ normal walking
speed. Previous studies also reported that wearing a safety harness
caused a signiﬁcant decrease in walking speed [18]. Due to this
intervention, studies that do not require a safety harness may observe
different outcomes.

The duration of the study was lengthy and required participants
to complete multiple time-consuming trials on the GAITRite which
could sometimes produce symptoms of fatigue in participants. To
mitigate the fatigue effect, participants were able to rest and re-
move the HMD between trials and conditions if needed. This rest
and removal of the HMD may have allowed them to regain spatial
orientation of the room setup and possibly skewed data results.

In our study, we applied the four auditory feedback conditions in
counterbalanced order, which reduces carryover or practice effects
[1–3]. Counterbalancing order was also reported to be effective
in many prior research [48, 54, 63]. Alternatively, we could have
applied the auditory feedback in randomized order to reduce bias.

However, our study included participants with MS who are very
prone to fatigue and cybersickness. Thus, we were more concerned
about the carryover fatigue and cybersickness effects on results. As
counterbalancing also reduces fatigue and cybersickness effects [2],
we preferred counterbalancing over randomization.

We applied the ”rhythmic” auditory feedback in every one-second
interval. However, we did not investigate this feedback condition
for other time intervals (e.g., two-second). Therefore, studies that
would apply ”rhythmic” auditory feedback for different time inter-
vals might ﬁnd slightly different results for this speciﬁc condition.
For static rest frame audio condition, continuously played white
noise could have had fatigue effect on participants. However, we did
not measure the fatigue effect for this condition.

In our study, the non-VR baseline was always done ﬁrst, which
might have inﬂuenced the walking speed for this condition. However,
we wanted to have enough baseline tasks before starting the VR
conditions to reduce the learning effect of VR conditions.

Our research focus was to investigate solutions to solve the gait
disturbance issues in VR. So, we did not consider non-VR audio
conditions. Also, adding the three auditory feedback conditions in
non-VR would result in three additional study conditions, which
would make the study signiﬁcantly longer. As our study included
participants with MI due to MS who had less physical ability and
were prone to fatigue, we tried to keep the study time shorter.

We had more female participants than males in our study. This is
because we recruited from the population with MS, which is statisti-
cally more common in females [6]. Many previous studies reported
no signiﬁcant effect of gender on balance [21, 37, 62]. However, we
plan to investigate the gender effect on balance in VR in our future
work.

We measured gait performance during VR intervention. We did
not measure the post-study effects on gait. Our motivation here was
accessibility rather than rehabilitation, and thus we only investigated
gait outside of VR as a baseline and during VR immersion.

We had ﬁve different study conditions. We performed three trials
for each study condition, which resulted in ﬁfteen trials for each
participant. We collected separate data ﬁles for each trial. Therefore,
we performed total of 585 trials for our 39 participants. The HMD
display stopped working during four trials of four participants (MI
group:3, Healthy group: 1). Restarting the ”Vive wireless app”
solved the issue each time. We repeated those four incomplete trials
and omitted the four incomplete data ﬁles.

We encountered challenges with participant recruitment due to
the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of our participants with MI had mul-
tiple sclerosis and were therefore immunosuppressed. This placed
them in the “high-risk” category for contracting COVID-19 and
deterred them from joining the study. We would have been able to
recruit a larger participant group and provide additional gait perfor-
mance results if the study was conducted at a period outside of the
pandemic.

9 CONCLUSION

We found signiﬁcant evidence that spatial, rhythmic, and static rest
frame auditory feedback conditions resulted in the improvement
of gait performance in both participant groups while immersed in
VR. Spatial audio improved gait parameters signiﬁcantly more than
rhythmic and static rest frame audio conditions. Also, improve-
ments of gait parameters were signiﬁcantly greater in participants
with mobility impairments than the participants without mobility
impairments. The results from this study will provide guidance to
researchers to better understand the implications of assistive tech-
nologies based on auditory feedback for improving gait performance
in HMD-based VEs. Furthermore, these results suggest that auditory
feedback should be considered more in the future development of
VR experiences to improve usability and accessibility, especially for
persons with mobility impairments.
