ABSTRACT

Context. The TeV BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is one of the primary candidates for a binary supermassive black hole system.
Aims. We study the ﬂux and spectral variability of PG 1553+113 on intra-night to long-term timescales using (i) BVRI data collected
over 76 nights from January 2016 to August 2019 involving nine optical telescopes and (ii) historical VR data (including ours) obtained
for the period from 2005 to 2019.
Methods. We analysed the light curves using various statistical tests, ﬁtting and cross-correlation techniques, and methods for the
search for periodicity. We examined the colour-magnitude diagrams before and after the corresponding light curves were corrected
for the long-term variations.
Results. Our intra-night monitoring, supplemented with literature data, result in a low duty cycle of ∼(10–18)%. In April 2019, we
recorded a ﬂare, which marks the brightest state of PG 1553+113 for the period from 2005 to 2019: R ≃ 13.2 mag. This ﬂare is
found to show a clockwise spectral hysteresis loop on its VR colour-magnitude diagram and a time lag in the sense that the V-band
variations lead the R-band ones. We obtain estimates of the radius, the magnetic ﬁeld strength, and the electron energy that characterize
the emission region related to the ﬂare. We ﬁnd a median period of (2.21 ± 0.04) years using the historical light curves. In addition, we
detect a secondary period of about 210 days using the historical light curves corrected for the long-term variations. We brieﬂy discuss
the possible origin of this period.

1. Introduction

Blazars are a sub-class of active galactic nuclei, which are
characterized by intense non-thermal radiation dominating their
spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to very high en-
ergy (VHE) passbands. This radiation is strongly beamed, orig-
inating in a relativistic jet pointing towards the Earth at a
small angle with the line of sight. From their optical spectra,

blazars have been classiﬁed into two categories, viz. BL Lac ob-
jects (having featureless optical spectra) and ﬂat spectrum radio
quasars (FSRQ, with broad emission lines in their optical spec-
tra).

Blazars have SEDs showing two peaks: one at low energies
(from radio to optical and X-rays) due to synchrotron emis-
sion and another one at high energies (X- to γ-rays) due to
inverse-Compton scattering of soft photons oﬀ the same rela-
tivistic electrons, which are responsible for the synchrotron radi-
ation (Königl 1981).

The frequency at which the synchrotron emission peaks is
used for further blazar classiﬁcation. Padovani & Giommi (1995)

classiﬁed BL Lac objects into low-energy peaked BL Lacs
(LBLs) and high-energy peaked BL Lacs (HBLs). This classi-
ﬁcation was then generalized by Abdo et al. (2010) to include
FSRQs: classes become low, intermediate, and high synchrotron
peaked blazars. In particular, the low synchrotron peaked blazar
class includes LBLs and virtually all FSRQs (Abdo et al. 2010).
Blazars show variability in all passbands, from radio to VHE
γ-rays, as well as strong radio and optical polarization and super-
luminal motions. Since the relativistic jet is supposed to domi-
nate the SED the strong variability could either be caused by in-
ternal processes within the jet itself or by accretion disk instabil-
ities triggering changes in it. At radio frequencies the interstellar
scintillation may also play a role (e.g. Heeschen et al. 1987).

Variability in blazars can be detected on diverse timescales.
We can broadly divide blazar variability into three temporal
classes, viz. intra-night variability (INV, or intra-day variability,
or microvariability) on timescales from minutes to hours (e.g.
Wagner & Witzel 1995; Kinman 1975; Clements et al. 2003;
Rector & Perlman 2003; Xie et al. 2004), short-term variabil-
ity (STV) on timescales from several days to a few months, and
long-term variability (LTV, e.g. Gupta et al. 2008; Agarwal et al.
2017) on timescales from several months to many years; in the
latter two classes the amplitude of the optical variability can of-
ten exceed even 5 mag (e.g. Bachev 2018). Variability studies are
a powerful tool to probe the nature of emission processes occur-
ring in blazars, their magnetic ﬁeld geometry, dominant particle
acceleration mechanisms, etc.

Along with ﬂux variability studies, analyses of colour trends
accompanying brightness changes have begun to be imple-
mented in the last decade through the colour-magnitude di-
agrams (CMDs). Three types of CMD behaviour could be
discerned: redder-when-brighter (RWB), bluer-when-brighter
(BWB), and achromatic. The RWB chromatism is most fre-
quently associated with FSRQs, for which the contribution of
the accretion disk to the total emission could be signiﬁcant. The
BWB behaviour is thought to be related to processes associated
to the relativistic jet, such as particle acceleration and cooling
in the framework of the shock-in-jet model (e.g. Marscher &
Gear 1985; Kirk et al. 1998). Alternatively, the BWB chroma-
tism could arise from a Doppler factor variation on a convex
spectrum (Villata et al. 2004; Papadakis et al. 2007). Finally, the
achromatic behaviour is most frequently interpreted as being due
to the variations of the Doppler factor, which are most likely ex-
plained in the framework of the geometric scenario (e.g. Villata
et al. 2002).

PG 1553+113 was discovered by the Palomar-Green survey
of UV-excess stellar objects (Green et al. 1986) and was clas-
siﬁed as a BL Lac object due to its featureless optical spectrum
(Miller & Green 1983) and signiﬁcant optical variability (Miller
et al. 1988). Furthermore, it was classiﬁed as an HBL, as its
synchrotron emission peak falls in the UV and X-ray frequency
range (Falomo & Treves 1990) and was detected at TeV ener-
gies (Aharonian et al. 2006). Due to its featureless optical spec-
trum and its host galaxy remaining undetected, the redshift of
PG 1553+113 has remained uncertain (e.g. Treves et al. 2007).
The recent detection of its putative galaxy group would set this
object’s redshift at z = 0.433 (Torres Zafra et al. 2017; Johnson
et al. 2019); we shall thus use this value throughout the paper.

PG 1553+113 is among the few blazars whose ﬂux variabil-
ity is claimed to be periodic. The ﬁrst hint for periodicity comes
from Ackermann et al. (2015) – they found a (2.18 ± 0.08) years
period analysing the Fermi/LAT γ-ray light curve (LC) of the
source. This period was further conﬁrmed by Prokhorov & Mor-
aghan (2017), Tavani et al. (2018), Sandrinelli et al. (2018),

Covino et al. (2020), and Peñil et al. (2020)1 at γ-rays and by
Cutini et al. (2016), Sandrinelli et al. (2018), and Covino et al.
(2020) in the R-band. On the other hand, Covino et al. (2019)
and Ait Benkhali et al. (2020) expressed some caution about the
signiﬁcance of the year-long period detected at γ-rays. Nilsson
et al. (2018) did not ﬁnd the claimed year-long period in their R-
band LC. In addition, Lico et al. (2020) found no signs for clear
periodic variability at the radio frequencies.

The caution expressed by Covino et al. (2019) and Ait
Benkhali et al. (2020) is based on the low global signiﬁcance
of the periods they found. Sandrinelli et al. (2018) also reported
modest global signiﬁcance of the periods for both high energy
and optical LCs of PG 1553+113. According to the authors,
however, the presence of one and the same period in both γ-ray
and R-band LCs means that this period could be real in spite of
the modest individual global signiﬁcance. Finally, Covino et al.
(2020) found that the addition of a periodic signal to the mod-
elling of the PG 1553+113 LCs improves their statistical de-
scription; the modelling itself is done by means of Gaussian pro-
cesses.

In this paper, we present the results from intensive intra-night
monitoring (INM) of PG 1553+113 along with the analysis of
its historical VR-band LCs. The paper is organized as follows.
We describe the observations and data reduction techniques in
Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we report the results of ﬂux and colour vari-
ability of the source from intra-night to longer timescales, while,
ﬁnally, Sect. 4 presents a discussion of our results followed by
the conclusions.

2. Observations and data reduction

The data presented here were obtained on 76 nights over a period
from January 2016 to August 2019. Observations were carried
out in the optical BVRI-bands using nine diﬀerent telescopes
around the globe which are: 2.15 m Jorge Sahade telescope (JS,
telescope A) and 60 cm Helen Sawyer Hogg telescope (HSH,
telescope B), CASLEO, Argentina; 2.0 m Ritchey-Chrétien (RC,
telescope C) and 50/70 cm Schmidt (telescope D) at the Rozhen
National Astronomical Observatory (NAO), Bulgaria; 2.01 m
RC Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT, telescope E) at Indian
Astronomical Observatory, Hanle, India; 1.3 m JC Bhattacharya
telescope (JCBT; telescope F) at the Vainu Bappu Observatory
(VBO), India; 1.0 m RC telescope (telescope G) and 60 cm RC
robotic telescope (telescope H) at TUBITAK National Observa-
tory (TUG), Antalya, Turkey; 50 cm Cassegrain telescope (tele-
scope I) located at the Astronomical Observatory of the Jagiel-
lonian University in Krakow, Poland.

The main characteristics and technical details for telescopes
A, B, C, D, and E can be found in Table 1 of Agarwal et al.
(2019). In addition to these, for the present work, we have used
four other optical telescopes (F, G, H, I), which we describe be-
low.

The JCBT telescope located at the VBO, Tamil Nadu, India,
is equipped with a 1k × 1k proEM CCD and a 2k × 4k regular
CCD (the proEM CCD has a smaller ﬁeld of view). As described
later in this section, to perform diﬀerential photometry, suitable
pairs of non-variable stars from the same observation frame are
necessary. Therefore, we chose the 2k × 4k CCD for our photo-
metric observations, whose central 2k × 2k region was used.

1 The authors presented the most comprehensive search for periodici-
ties at γ-rays using ten diﬀerent methods along with the corresponding
techniques for signiﬁcance estimation of the periods found.

The 1.0 m RC telescope is located at the Bakirlitepe Moun-
tain and is currently operated remotely from TUG in Antalya.
The telescope is equipped with 4k × 4k CCD camera working at
−90 ◦C. Each observation was taken with 2 × 2 binning and con-
sisted of several exposures through R ﬁlter and 1-2 sets of BVRI
frames.

The 60 cm RC robotic telescope is also located at TUG. The
observations with this telescope are object-based and fully auto-
matic. Observers are allocated a maximum of 3 000 sec for each
day on this telescope. After observations, the bias, dark, and ﬂat
corrected frames by the TALON pipeline are sent to observers.
The robotic telescope is equipped with a 2k × 2k CCD camera
and with 12 standard ﬁlters. As long as the weather is suitable,
the observation was taken daily with 1 × 1 binning and 1-2 sets
of BVRI frames.

In the period between May 7 and June 5, 2018, we performed
observations of PG 1553+113 using the 50 cm Cassegrain tele-
scope located at the Astronomical Observatory of the Jagiel-
lonian University in Krakow, Poland. The telescope is equipped
with an Apogee Alta U42 CCD and a set of broadband ﬁlters
(Bessell 1990). The BVRI data were taken with 2 × 2 binning,
with exposure times between 60 sec and 100 sec, depending on
the weather conditions and the ﬁlter used. This camera accom-
modates an e2v, back-illuminated chip with 2048 px of 13 µm in
size. The calibration images were taken every night by collecting
series of bias, dark and sky ﬂat-ﬁeld frames.

Finally, the 2.0 m telescope of the Rozhen NAO was used
in two additional observing conﬁgurations compared to that
reported in Agarwal et al. (2019): the CCD camera VersAr-
ray:1300B attached directly to the RC focus and the two CCD
cameras Andor iKon-L attached at the ports of the two-channel
focal reducer FoReRo-2 (Jockers et al. 2000; Bonev 2011).

Additional information about the new telescopes and conﬁg-
urations can be found in Table 1. The complete observations log
corresponding to the data collected during our monitoring cam-
paign is given in Table 2.

A detailed description of the data reduction procedure is
given in Agarwal & Gupta (2015). To summarize, the data reduc-
tion of all CCD frames, including bias correction, ﬂat-ﬁelding,
and cosmic-ray removal was performed using IRAF2 software.
After correcting the CCD frames, the Dominion Astronomi-
cal Observatory Photometry (DAOPHOT II) software (Stetson
1987, 1992) was used to perform aperture photometry which
gave us the instrumental magnitudes of the source and all the
stars in the CCD frames.

To build the instrumental diﬀerential LCs, we used four
steady comparison stars in the frame (Raiteri et al. 2015). We
ﬁnally selected those two stars that show smaller scatter of the
star-star diﬀerential LC. As pointed out by Cellone et al. (2007),
spurious INV could be detected if the comparison stars diﬀer
much in brightness with respect to the target. Therefore, we se-
lected those comparison stars which had magnitude and colour
close to that of the target blazar. The dispersion in the star-star
LCs was checked for every night and various apertures, start-
ing from a value equal to the full width at half maximum to
four times this value. Finally, the aperture with minimum dis-
persion in the star-star LCs was selected. An aperture radius of
4′′ was thus used. The calibration of instrumental magnitudes

3. Results

3.1. Intra-night variability

The LCs derived during the 28 nights of INM are shown in
Fig. A.1. The date of observation and the telescope used are in-
dicated in each plot. We show only LCs having a minimum of
10 data points acquired during the particular night.

Considering the modest number of data points in a single
ﬁlter, we used the C-test and the F-test, both set at a 99.5% con-
ﬁdence level to assign variability status to the intra-night LCs.
The tests are described in detail in Agarwal et al. (2019). Even
if the comparison and control stars were appropriately selected,
we applied the Γ scaling factor (Howell et al. 1988) to equalize
the target and control error distributions, since this procedure has
been shown to give the most reliable results (e.g. Zibecchi et al.
2017, 2020).

After computing the parameters of each test with the original
choice of stars (C1, F1), we then recalculated them with compar-
ison and control stars interchanged (C2, F2) as a check for any
issue in the LC. We have designated a light curve to be variable
(Var) if both tests rejected the null hypothesis (i.e. non-variable
LC) at a 99.5% conﬁdence level and non-variable (NV) if at least
one of the tests failed to reject the null hypothesis. The results
from the INV tests are summarized in Table A.1.

details about the DC see Romero et al. 1999). In order to im-
prove this estimate, we searched the literature for other cases of
INM of PG 1553+113.

The ﬁrst INM of PG 1553+113 to our knowledge was re-
ported by Stalin et al. (2005) – they applied the C-test to the
R-band LCs (total duration of about 10 hr) and found the source
to be variable in one night out of two. Another two nights of
INM about 13 hr long were presented by Osterman et al. (2006).
They found no signiﬁcant INV, but they did not present statisti-
cal tests. To quantify the conclusion of Osterman et al. (2006),
we used the C-test in the form C = σ/hei, where σ is the stan-
dard deviation of the source LC and hei the mean uncertainty
of the source photometric measurements. We applied this test to
the data listed in Table 4 of Osterman et al. (2006) and found
C = 1.52 and C = 1.28 for the respective nights, which means
that PG 1553+113 was non-variable. Andruchow et al. (2007,
2011) reported the results from the INM they carried out during
four nights in the VR-bands (April 21 to 24, 2007) and ﬁve nights
in the BR-bands (April 21 to 25, 2009), respectively. Applying
the C-test, the authors found no signiﬁcant variability. Gopal-
Krishna et al. (2011) detected INV during three nights out of
three using C- and F-tests (a total monitoring duration of 16 hr
in the R-band). Gaur et al. (2012) found no INV during six nights
of monitoring in the BR-bands (C- and F-tests were applied).
Gupta et al. (2016) presented the results from the INM during
seven nights in the R-band (a total monitoring duration of about
26 hr). The authors found the source to be variable in one night,
non-variable in another, and probably variable in the remaining
nights (F- and χ2 tests were applied). We, however, should point
out that in the latter nights the variability amplitude seems to be
quite close to the magnitude uncertainties. In such cases the us-
age of the C-test could be more appropriate (see Zibecchi et al.
2017, 2020). Pandey et al. (2019) monitored PG 1553+113 for
eight nights in the VR-bands for 2–4 hr each night. Employing
enhanced F- and nested ANOVA tests, the authors found the
source to vary on intra-night timescales for three nights. Finally,
Pasierb et al. (2020) found no INV in the BVR-bands during a
single night of monitoring (duration of about 3.7 hr, F-test em-
ployed).

It is worth mentioning the study of Meng et al. (2018), which
is focused mainly on the LTV of a sample of blazars including
PG 1553+113. For this source the observations were performed
for 28 nights through three intermediate-band ﬁlters. The authors
did not ﬁnd INV during each of the observing nights using four
statistical tests. In some of the nights, however, the observing
time span is insuﬃcient for the INV testing – less than an hour.
So, we re-analysed the PG 1553+113 data selecting those nights
for which the observing time span is ∆t > 2 hr and the number

of the acquired data points is N > 3. In this way we got a total of
eight nights with 2.2 hr ≤ ∆t ≤ 4.6 hr and 7 ≤ N ≤ 11. We then
applied the C-test and assumed the source to be variable for the
given night if C ≥ 2.576, at least in two of the passbands. We
found this condition not met for the selected nights.

The literature data, combined with ours, resulted in a total
of 74 nights of PG 1553+113 INM. Despite the large number of
nights of INM the blazar PG 1553+113 was found to show INV
during only eight nights; during another ﬁve nights, the source
was classiﬁed as probably variable. Because of the lack of infor-
mation about the total monitoring duration for some of the lit-
erature data, we computed the DC simply as NINV/NINM, where
NINV is the number of the nights with INV detected and NINM the
total number of nights of INM. The so computed DC is 10.8%
if the probably variable cases are considered non-variable and
17.6% – otherwise. Our result agrees with the DC of 11.6% re-
ported by Andruchow et al. (2014) for a sample of 6 HBLs.

3.3. Long-term variability

We based the study of the optical behaviour of PG 1553+113 at
long-term timescales on our observations along 76 nights from
2016 to 2019. In the course of this multi-wavelength campaign,
we acquired a total of ∼3350 data points in BVRI-bands.

In order to remove eﬀects due to dense intra-night sampling
during some of the nights, we performed nightly binning of our
data. Firstly, we discarded some unreliable data points and then
the magnitudes obtained during each given night were weight-
averaged. Regarding the uncertainties of the weight-averaged
magnitudes, we adopted the following conservative estimate: we
took the larger between (i) the uncertainty of the weighted mean
(which accounts only for the individual measurement uncertain-
ties) and (ii) the weighted standard deviation about the weighted
mean (which accounts mainly for the scatter of the individual
data points with respect to the weighted mean). Finally, we took
the median of the corresponding MJDs. The data points that give
rise to uncertainties of the weight-averaged magnitudes larger
than or equal to 0.1 mag were removed and the binning was done
again.

Our long-term BVRI-band LCs are presented in Fig. 1. Both
statistical tests applied to them revealed that LTV is highly sig-
niﬁcant at all four photometric passbands.

The most remarkable feature of the LCs is the ﬂare that was
detected in all passbands on April 14, 2019 (MJD ∼8588.4) with
the R magnitude reaching 13.212, which seems to be the high-
est level recorded for PG 1553+113 (see also the Erratum3 to

Jankowsky & Wagner 2019). On the other hand, the source at-
tained the faintest state on January 12, 2016 (MJD ∼7400.7) with
an R magnitude of 14.444. We observed a trend of a larger vari-
ability amplitude at higher frequencies on a long-term basis. The
LTV characteristics are given in Table 3. We also assembled the
historical VR LCs of PG 1553+113 covering a time interval from
2005 to 2019 (Appendix B, Fig. B.1).

3.4. Colour-magnitudediagram

Multi-band monitoring campaigns in the optical BVRI-bands
help us in studying spectral changes on various timescales. The
study of CMDs could shed some light on the physical processes
causing the blazar ﬂux variations. In this context, we ﬁrstly con-
sidered our BVRI data set and then the historical VR one. Gener-
ally, we calculated colour indices by coupling data taken during
the same night. The coupling within the night is justiﬁed as the
DC of the INV of PG 1553+113 is low (see Sect. 3.2).

We plot in Fig. 2 the colour index with the largest frequency
base, viz. B − I, against the R magnitude – we choose the R-
band following the prescription of Massaro & Trèvese (1996).
The presented CMD – from our data only – shows no clear cor-
relation. Instead, one could trace a RWB chromatism when the
source is faint and a BWB one when the source is bright. Similar
behaviour was reported by Ikejiri et al. (2011) using V − J vs.
V CMD; the source was observed in the V JKS-bands from 2008
to 2010. The number of the data points used to build the above
mentioned CMDs is relatively small, so, any conclusions based
on their analysis should be considered with caution. A denser
sampling on B − R vs. R CMD for PG 1553+113 was achieved
by Wierzcholska et al. (2015); the source was observed in BR-
bands from 2007 to 2012. The authors reported a statistically
non-signiﬁcant RWB trend considering the whole data set and
both RWB and BWB trends on shorter time intervals.

Let us analyse the historical LCs constructed by us from the
data sets presented in the Appendix B. Although the frequency
base is not so large, the time span (from 2005 to 2019) and the
total amplitude of variations are suﬃcient to look for possible
CMD peculiarities. We plot in the upper panel of Fig. 3 the CMD
for the historical data set: the colour indices are plotted against
the mean of the V and R magnitudes. This mean could be consid-
ered as representative of the intermediate-band magnitude. The
overall trend is BWB with the following characteristics of the
corresponding linear least-squares ﬁt: a slope of 0.030 ± 0.004;
χ2
df = 2.8; a linear Pearson correlation coeﬃcient rCMD = 0.16
with corresponding p-value of 0.002; a standard deviation about
the ﬁtted line of 0.037 mag. In the following, we shall consider a
CMD trend (i) signiﬁcant at 99% conﬁdence level if rCMD ≥ 0.5

per panel, 373 data points plotted) and for our, Steward, and

uncertainties of the magnitudes and colour indices are 0.018 mag

and the null hypothesis probability is p ≤ 0.01 (e.g. Gupta et al.
2016) and (ii) achromatic if the absolute value of the slope is less
than the corresponding ﬁtted uncertainty. Therefore, the so ob-
tained BWB trend is non-signiﬁcant. In addition, the presented
CMD shows a large scatter about the ﬁtted line. This scatter is
caused mainly by the data sets we used: they are obtained us-
ing various telescope+ﬁlter+CCD combinations and the diﬀer-
ences in the resulting response curves were not taken into ac-
count during the inter-calibration process. In an attempt to mini-
mize this eﬀect we plot the CMD for our, Steward4, and Kanata
VR data sets (Fig. 3, lower panel); the other sets are single-band
or had to be transformed to the VR-bands, so, their contribution
to the scatter is more substantial. Now, the BWB trend becomes
clearer and has the following linear ﬁt characteristics: a slope
of 0.041 ± 0.004; χ2
df = 3.6; a linear Pearson correlation coeﬃ-
cient rCMD = 0.35 with corresponding p-value less than 10−5; a
standard deviation about the ﬁtted line of 0.027 mag. This weak
trend, however, is non-signiﬁcant following the above criterion.
The CMD shows three segments at diﬀerent mean brightness
levels in which local RWB trends could be followed. Similar
complicated behaviour – an overall BWB chromatism with local
RWB trends – could be traced on the B − R vs. R CMD of Raiteri
et al. (2015) which has a smaller time span (about ﬁve months)
but an excellent time coverage.

Furthermore, we plot in Fig. 4 the temporal variations of the
V − R colour index compared to the scaled R-band LC. The com-
parison suggests no clear correlation.

To study the colour index behaviour on small timescales, we
divided the LCs into separate segments. Considering Fig. B.1
one sees 5 distinct minima that divide the LCs into 6 ﬂares; in

4 In what follows, the Steward Observatory and the Kanata telescope
will be referred to as Steward and Kanata, respectively, for short.

Fig. 4: Temporal evolution of the V −R colour index (black dots).
The scaled R-band LC is overplotted for comparison (magenta
line, the ﬂux increases along +y axis). The horizontal dashed line
marks the weighted mean V −R value of (0.339±0.002) mag with
a weighted standard deviation of 0.030 mag about the weighted
mean. The insert shows the 2019 ﬂare in details – the maximum
of the spectral hardness (the minimum of V − R) precedes the
ﬂare by about 10 days (see Sect. 3.5 for details).

addition, the 6th ﬂare can be divided into a pre-ﬂare (around MJD
of 8000) and a ﬂare5. Eventually, we divided the LCs into seven
segments and built a CMD for each of them. The most signiﬁcant
trend (rCMD = 0.49 and p = 0.0007) was found for the brightest
ﬂare – this ﬂare will be analysed in details in Sect. 3.5. Regard-
ing the other segments, all of them show either achromatism or
non-signiﬁcant chromatism. In particular, the pre-ﬂare could be
considered achromatic – the absolute value of the CMD slope
(viz. −0.007 ± 0.011) is less than its uncertainty.

The inspection of Fig. B.1 suggests at least two variable com-
ponents – a long-term one, responsible for the quasi-periodic
behaviour of the source, and a short-term one producing the
ﬂux variations onto the top of the long-term component, that is,
F(tot)(t) = F(long)(t) + F(short)(t), where F means ﬂux. Therefore,
to study the CMD behaviour on small scales, we have to remove
the possible impact on their CMDs of the long-term variations.
We shall assume that the long-term component is achromatic on
the base of the above analysis.

To separate the components presumed, we used the approach
of Villata et al. (2002). As a ﬁrst step, we binned the VR-band
LCs over a time interval of 10 days. Then, we transformed mag-
nitudes into ﬂuxes6 and ﬁtted a cubic spline to the binned LCs.

6 The magnitude-to-ﬂux transformation was done as follows. Firstly,
the calibrated BVRI magnitudes of the blazar were corrected for the
Galactic extinction using the values taken from the NASA/IPAC Extra-
galactic Database: AB = 0.188 mag, AV = 0.142 mag, AR = 0.113 mag,
and AI = 0.078 mag. The extinction corrected magnitudes were then
converted into ﬂuxes using the zero points of Bessell et al. (1998).

through the 10-day binned LCs, are overplotted (V-band – green

is 0.89 ± 0.06 (s.d.), which corresponds to a two-point spectral
index α(spl)
VR = 0.72 ± 0.42 – these are the ﬂux ratio and spectral
index of the long-term component (or the base level). The spline
ﬁts are very similar, so, we averaged them for further analysis.
After that we subtracted from the VR-band LCs the mean spline,
shifted in such a way, that the condition [F(t)−e(t)]−F(spl)(t) > 0
is fulﬁlled for each MJD and both passbands; here e is the un-
certainty of the ﬂux level F. In this way, we corrected the LCs

are: a slope of 0.120 ± 0.007; χ2
df = 5.3; a linear Pearson cor-
relation coeﬃcient rCMD = 0.22 with corresponding p-value of
0.003; a standard deviation about the ﬁtted line of 0.131 mJy.

The scatter about the ﬁtted line now is larger compared to
the pre-corrected CMD scatter of 0.022 mJy. This could be at-
tributed mainly to the unknown true base level and shape. Re-
garding the shape, we implicitly assumed that it could be rep-
resented by the cubic spline ﬁtted to the binned LCs. Thus, by
correcting as explained above, we introduce uncertainties, ﬁrstly,
by the base level subtraction itself and, secondly, by the Doppler
boosting correction based on this level. The other source of un-
certainties is the quality of the cubic spline interpolation, which
depends on the LC sampling – both in terms of the total number
of data points and the degree of their clustering. We, however,
can consider this source of less importance regarding the CMD
scatter. Despite the large scatter, now the CMD shows no sig-
niﬁcant sub-structure compared to the pre-corrected CMD (see
Fig. 3).

Regarding the short time span segments, we divided the his-
torical LCs into, the situation does not change. All segments
but the pre-ﬂare and ﬂare ones show either achromatism or non-
signiﬁcant chromatism. Now, the pre-ﬂare shows non-signiﬁcant
BWB chromatism (after removing 3 deviant data points) and
the ﬂare BWB trend gets more signiﬁcant – rCMD = 0.63 and
p < 10−5.

The above analysis shows that on both long and short
timescales, the variability of PG 1553+113 has no signiﬁcant
chromatism (except the 2019 ﬂare). Another notable result is
that the corrected LCs show signs for quasi-periodicity (see
Sect. 3.6).

Given the achromaticity alone, we cannot distinguish
whether it reﬂects variations caused by geometric eﬀects or by
processes intrinsic to the jet. However, the observed periodici-
ties, discussed in Sect. 3.6, could be considered in support of the
geometric origin of the PG 1553+113 variability (e.g. Sobacchi
et al. 2017).

3.5. The 2019 ﬂare

3.5.1. Colour hysteresis and time lag

During April 2019, PG 1553+113 reached its historical bright-
ness maximum showing a prominent ﬂare. The ﬂare shows some
sub-structure – there is a ﬂux increase (sub-ﬂares?) around MJD
8550 and MJD 8610 (the latter is best traced in the R-band). The
LCs sampling, however, is not good enough to derive further
conclusions about these sub-structures. The detailed inspection
of the ﬂux and colour (or spectral) index behaviour during the
ﬂare revealed a lag of the ﬂux changes behind the spectral ones
(see Fig. 4). The spectrum got its hardest value (data point #8 in
Fig. 8) before the ﬂux maximum was reached (data point #19)
and then continuously softened till the end of the ﬂare. The cor-
responding CMD shows a clockwise spectral hysteresis loop –
the spectrum hardens (i.e. gets ﬂatter ≡ shows BWB chroma-
tism) as the ﬂux rises and softens (i.e. gets steeper ≡ shows RWB
chromatism) as the ﬂux declines (Fig. 8). This kind of hystere-
sis is typically observed at X-rays in HBLs (e.g. Takahashi et al.
1996) and signals to the existence of a time lag, T : the ﬂux vari-
ations at a high frequency (V-band) lead those at a low frequency
(R-band; this is the so-called ‘soft’ lag7). The detected hysteresis
loop could also be traced on the CMD built using only our and

7 This notation comes from X-ray passbands and means the hard X-
rays lead the soft X-rays. The opposite is known as a ‘hard’ lag.

are our, Steward, and Kanata data sets corrected for the long-
term variations. The best ﬁt linear model to the data is overplot-
ted. The median uncertainties of the ﬂuxes and ﬂux ratios are

sponding spectral index: α = [(V − R) − (AV − AR) − 0.186]/0.07,
is also indicated. Here AV and AR stand for the Galactic extinc-
tion in the VR-bands, respectively (see Sect. 3.4). The clockwise

for the variable long-term component. The spline ﬁts and the
adopted base levels are shown in Fig. 5.

The next assumption, based solely on the achromaticity, is
that the base level variability is a result of the Doppler fac-
tor change. We recall that the Doppler factor changes if the
viewing angle varies. To account for this relativistic boosting
we divided each ﬂux data point by the ratio, C(t), between the
spline value at that time and the spline global minimum value,
C(t) = F(spl)(t)/F(spl)
min .

The resulting ‘corrected’ LCs are presented in Fig. 6. The
variation amplitudes are comparable over the entire period cov-
ered by the historical data set. This should mean that we see the
variations of the short-term component alone. The correspond-
ing CMD, however, still does not show any clear chromatism
(Fig. 7). The characteristics of the linear ﬁt presented in Fig. 7

Steward data sets as well as on the CMD built using the historical
VR data sets after their correction for the long-term variations.
So, we shall consider this hysteresis as real rather than an artefact
from the heterogeneous data used.

To search for the expected time lag we utilized both the dis-
crete correlation function (DCF, Edelson & Krolik 1988) and the
z-transformed DCF (ZDCF, Alexander 1997, 2014). We cross-
correlated the V- and R-band LCs transformed into ﬂuxes.

The DCF is commonly used to search for correlation in two
unevenly sampled time series. We did not take into account the
measurement uncertainties in the construction of the DCF fol-
lowing White & Peterson (1994). In our particular case the dis-
crete correlations were binned using a time lag bin of width
∆T = 1.5 days and a Gaussian weighting scheme was applied,
so that the higher importance is assigned to the unbinned val-
ues closer to the bin centre. In our notation the positive lag
means that the variations in the V-band lead those in the R-
band. The time lag was determined using both the Gaussian
ﬁtting and the centroiding methods; we took into account only
those lags, for which the correlation coeﬃcient is larger than
0.5. We found Tgauss = (5.76 ± 1.48) days using the Gaussian ﬁt
and Tcent = 3.71 days using the weighted centroid. The DCF is
shown in Fig. 9. For more reliable estimation of the time lag and
its uncertainty, we applied the ﬂux randomization/random subset
selection method (FR/RSS, Peterson et al. 1998) based on Monte
Carlo simulations. The data points counted more than once dur-
ing the RSS process were rejected. For each FR/RSS realization
the time lag was found by means of the Gaussian ﬁt. We ran a
total of 1000 cycles and the resulted time lag values were used
to build the cross-correlation peaks distribution (CCPD, Maoz
& Netzer 1989). The CCPD is shown in Fig. 10 and the derived
time lag is TCCPD = 4.86+2.50
−2.62 days. The quoted time lag value is
the 50th percentile (the median) of the CCPD, while the 16th and
85th percentiles serve as the 1σ time lag uncertainties.

The application of ZDCF gave similar results (Fig. 11). The
corresponding estimates of the time lag are Tgauss = (3.71 ±
0.88) days and Tcent = 3.85 days. It is worth noting the better
agreement between these estimates compared to the DCF ones.
So, we detected a signiﬁcant positive time lag in agreement with
the clockwise spectral hysteresis.

3.5.2. Flare ﬁt

In order to quantify the ﬂare, we ﬁtted it with an exponential law
(Valtaoja et al. 1999) plus a linear base level:

F(t) =

a + b t + exp[+(t − tmax)/Tris]
a + b t + exp[−(t − tmax)/Tdec]

(

if t ≤ tmax
if t ≥ tmax

,

where (a, b) are the parameters of the local linear base level, tmax
the epoch of the ﬂare maximum and (Tris, Tdec) the ﬂare rise and
decay e-folding timescales, respectively. The data points belong-
ing to the possible sub-ﬂare at MJD ∼8550 and the data point at
the R-band maximum were excluded from the ﬁt. The ﬁtted max-
imum position along with the rise and decay e-folding timescales
are listed in Table 4. The resulting ﬁts are shown in Fig. 12.

The ﬁts conﬁrmed the time lag found by the cross-correlation
techniques – the ﬂare V-band LC leads the R-band one by Tﬁt =
(2.6 ± 0.2) days. This lag equals to the cross-correlation one to
within the uncertainties quoted.

3.6. Search forperiodicity

We addressed the PG 1553+113 periodicity issue using our his-
torical VR-band LCs and applying three diﬀerent methods. The
periodicity presence is obvious if we consider the spline ﬁts to
the historical LCs (see Fig. 5); we recall that the spline ﬁts repre-
sent the long-term variability component. To quantify the period-
icity, we ﬁtted a sine function of the form F(t) ∝ sin(2πt/P + Φ)
to the corresponding spline; here P and Φ stand for the period
and phase, respectively. The resulting ﬁts are shown in Fig. 13.
We found periods of (807 ± 20) days and (812 ± 30) days consid-
ering the V- and R-band LCs, respectively. The corresponding
mean diﬀerences between the maxima of the splines and of the
ﬁtted sine waves are (9 ± 20) days and (17 ± 30) days. The quoted
standard errors of the mean were used as the uncertainties of the
corresponding periods.

Next, we applied the classical Lomb-Scargle periodogram
(LSP) analysis, which was proposed by Lomb (1976) and ex-

tended by Scargle (1982). The LSP has been generalized for
more practical use by Press & Rybicki (1989). More details
are outlined in VanderPlas (2018) and references therein. The
statistical signiﬁcance of the periods, found by means of LSP
and REDFIT (see below) methods, is evaluated locally (e.g. Ait
Benkhali et al. 2020).

The periodograms are shown in Figs. 14 and 15. The max-
ima of the most signiﬁcant peaks correspond to periods of

(803 ± 70) days and (801 ± 62) days, for the V- and R-band LCs,
respectively. The quoted uncertainties represent the half-width at
the half-power maximum derived by means of Gaussian ﬁt; we
ignore the possible asymmetry of the ﬁtted peaks. These peri-
ods agree to within the uncertainties with the ones obtained by
applying the sine ﬁts to the splines. Because of this, we shall
consider these periods as real. There are, however, a number of
additional, less signiﬁcant peaks – their existence is most proba-
bly caused either by the departure of the shape of the folded LCs

Carlo simulations.

from a sinusoid (see the inserts of Figs. 14 and 15) or by aliasing
due to the ﬁnite monitoring time span and irregular sampling.
So, we shall not consider these peaks further.

Inspecting Fig. 14 one can see that the amplitude of the
power spectrum between the major peaks, that is, the noise-
induced power spectrum decreases with decreasing period –
this is a signature of the presence of red noise; generally, the
red noise arises from stochastic processes and is frequency-
dependent. To test if the power spectrum peaks are signiﬁcant
against the red noise background, we utilized the improved trans-
lation of the REDFIT programme (Schulz & Mudelsee 2002)
run within the R environment8. In this programme an auto-
regressive process of ﬁrst-order (AR1) is used to approximate
the red noise. Before actual computations, we checked whatever
the AR1 model is appropriate to characterize our historical VR-
band LCs; the non-parametric runs test indicates that both the
VR spectra are consistent with the AR1 model.

We ran REDFIT using the oversampling factor of 4, two over-
lapping by 50% segments, and Welch spectral window. The re-
sults are shown in Fig. 16. The peaks exceeding the 99% sig-
niﬁcance level correspond to periods of (772 ± 85) days and
(817 ± 107) days, for the V- and R-band, respectively. The pe-
riods agree to within the uncertainties with the above estimates;
the uncertainties are larger owing to the broader peaks.

There is another peak above the 99% signiﬁcance level corre-
sponding to a period of (248±12) days (Fig. 16, R-band9). A hint
for quasi-periodicity on such timescales could be found inspect-
ing Fig. 6, especially the R-band LC. A similar period was found
by Sandrinelli et al. (2018): (250±60) days. In addition, the most
signiﬁcant rest-frame period, reported by Nilsson et al. (2018) –

well, but at lower signiﬁcance.

174 days – is in agreement with the above periods, transformed
to the rest-frame.

To check further the existence of a possible period in the
range 200–250 days, we apply the LSP method and the REDFIT
programme to the LCs corrected for the long-term variations.
The results from the LSP application are presented in Figs. 17
and 18. The most signiﬁcant peaks correspond to periods of
(208 ± 6) days and (212 ± 6) days, for the VR-band LCs, respec-
tively. The REDFIT found the following periods: (211 ± 10) days
and (210 ± 8) days, for the VR-band LCs, respectively (Fig. 19).
The non-parametric runs test, however, indicated that the spec-
trum of the corrected V-band LC is inconsistent with the AR1

paign, we selected diﬀerent states of the source as follows: an
outburst state (March 13 and April 4, 2019), intermediate state
(June 11, 2016, May 10, 2018, and February 28, 2019) and low
state (January 12 and August 11, 2016). These seven SEDs dis-
play an increasing trend, which could hint towards the fact that
the synchrotron peak is located above 1015 Hz. This is in accor-
dance with the HBL classiﬁcation. Therefore, based upon our
optical study, we can conclude that the source behaves more like
an HBL rather than an LBL. However, these optical SEDs cover
a narrow frequency range, therefore further multi-wavelength
observations will oﬀer a more powerful diagnosis of the true
class of the source.

The SEDs do not show any signiﬁcant shape change as the
mean ﬂux level varies. This lack of variations in the SED shapes
allows us to build the mean SED over the time interval covered
by our monitoring campaign using the weighted mean magni-
tudes listed in Table 3. To get the mean spectral index, we ﬁtted
a straight line of the form log(Fν) = −α log(ν) + const to the
mean SED. We got α = 0.89 ± 0.06 with χ2
df = 1.1, a result
consistent with those of Falomo et al. (1994) and Pandey et al.
(2019).

model, that is, non-AR1 components are present; the REDFIT
assumes that the noise in a time series can be approximated by
an AR1 process.

In Table 5 we summarize the periods found. The local sig-
niﬁcance of the periods – except those, obtained by means of
the sine wave ﬁt – is greater than 2.5σ. The similar local sig-
niﬁcance of the same year-long period was found by Sandrinelli
et al. (2018) using the AR1 model.

3.7. Spectral energy distribution

To further understand spectral variations in the source, we stud-
ied its multi-band optical SEDs. In Fig. 20, we have generated
optical SEDs of PG 1553+113 considering all dates when we
have quasi-simultaneous observations in at least three optical
passbands. To display SED variations during our observing cam-

Article number, page 12 of 21

In this paper, we have presented the results from the optical mon-
itoring of the blazar PG 1553+113 from 2016 to 2019 on intra-
night and long-term timescales. We have also constructed and
analysed the historical 2005–2019 VR-band LCs of the blazar.

In the course of our monitoring campaign, we recorded in
April 2019 the brightest state of PG 1553+113 for the period
from 2005 to 2019, covered by the historical LC (see Figs. 1
and B.1): R ≃ 13.2 mag. In general, the variations of the
PG 1553+113 ﬂux on both long and short timescales are achro-
matic, except the 2019 ﬂare. The spectral index that character-
izes the mean SED of the blazar over the period from 2005 to
2019 is α = 0.89±0.06. We shall discuss below some constraints
on the jet parameters imposed by our observing results.

4.1. Intra-night variability

From the analysis of our and literature INM data during a total of
74 nights, we found a low value of the PG 1553+113 DC: 10.8%

 
 
 
 
Agarwal et al.: Multi-band behaviour of PG 1553+113 in optical range

if the probably variable cases are considered non-variable and
17.6% – otherwise. This result agrees with the low DC reported
for HBLs (e.g. Andruchow et al. 2014). The low value of the DC
imposes some constraints on the physical jet parameters.

Let us assume that the INV in blazars is associated with in-
teractions of shocks with small scale structures – like density
inhomogeneities or eddies – in the otherwise steady jet ﬂow.
Then the low DC value of HBLs could be explained with the
strong magnetic ﬁeld present in this sub-class of blazars (e.g.
Sambruna et al. 1996). Romero (1995) found that the axial mag-
netic ﬁeld halts the build-up of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in
the sub-parsec to parsec scale jets when the ﬁeld value exceeds
the critical value deﬁned as:

Bc =

4πnemec2
h

(cid:16)

(cid:17)i

Γ 2 − 1

1/2

Γ −1,

(1)

where ne is the local electron density, me the rest mass of the
electron, and Γ the bulk Lorentz factor of the ﬂow. Therefore,
we have that, in case of HBLs, there will be no instabilities when
B > Bc, which in turn reduces the incidence of rapid variability
in their optical LCs.

4.2. The 2019 ﬂare

The 2019 ﬂare marks the brightest state of PG 1553+113 for the
period from 2005 to 2019. The analysis of the ﬂare VR-band
LCs revealed a clockwise hysteresis loop and a soft lag, which
means that the synchrotron cooling of accelerated electrons is
the dominant emission mechanism of the ﬂare (Kirk et al. 1998).
The ﬂare has a slight asymmetry, with the rising part being
steeper. This asymmetry, however, is questionable because of the
putative sub-ﬂare at MJD ∼8610, which is not well resolved in
order to be accounted for in the proper way. So, for further anal-
ysis, we shall assume that the 2019 ﬂare is symmetric with the
decay timescale equal to the rise one. This means that the cool-
ing time is smaller than or comparable to the light crossing time,
tcool <∼ R/c.

4.2.1. Radius of the emitting region

Under the assumption that the injection time is less than the light
crossing time, the rising part of the ﬂare LC could be used to con-
strain the radius of the emitting region: R <∼ cTrisδ/(1 + z), where
δ is the Doppler factor and z the redshift. Using a rise timescale
of 24.9 days, which is the weighted mean over the V- and R-band
rise timescales, we got a radius of R <∼ 4.5 × 1016δ cm.

Regarding the Doppler factor of PG 1553+113, there exist
two sets of values. The ﬁrst set is based on the multi-wavelength
SED modelling – δ varies from 20 (Tavecchio et al. 2010) to
40 (Aleksi´c et al. 2015). The second, single-value set is based
on the Very Long Baseline Array observations – δ is equal to
1.4 (Lico et al. 2020). This discrepancy is typical for TeV HBLs
and reﬂects the so called ‘Doppler crisis’ (Tavecchio 2006). The
‘Doppler crisis’ can be resolved if one assumes the presence of
the velocity gradient either in the axial or in the transverse direc-
tion (for details see, e.g. Piner & Edwards 2018, and references
therein). This assumption could reduce the Doppler factor that
characterizes the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton models.

The typical radius of the emitting region, used in the SED
modelling, is R <∼ 1017 cm (e.g. Aleksi´c et al. 2015; Banerjee
et al. 2019). Therefore, the Doppler factor must be δ <∼ 3 given
our estimate of the weighted mean rise timescale. The Doppler
factor of 20–40, as derived from the SED modelling, would re-
sult in a too large radius, R ≃ (9−18) × 1017 cm.

4.2.2. Magnetic ﬁeld strength and electron energies in the

emitting region

Assuming tcool <∼ R/c, we could estimate the lower limit of
the magnetic ﬁeld strength in the emitting region using the rise
timescales listed in Table 4 (Ghisellini et al. 1997):

Bδ1/3 >∼ 0.67 ν−1/3

15 T −2/3

ris

(1 + US/UB) −2/3 (1 + z)1/3,

(2)

where B is in units of Gauss, Tris is in units of days, ν15 is the ob-
served frequency (in units of 1015 Hz), US the radiation energy
density of the synchrotron emission, and UB the magnetic en-
ergy density; the energy densities are measured in the comoving
frame and we assume that US = UB. We got Bδ1/3 >∼ 0.071 G for
the V-band and Bδ1/3 >∼ 0.072 G for the R-band. So, if we use
Doppler factors of 3 and 20, then the respective lower limits are
0.05 G and 0.03 G and they are the same for both VR-bands.

An independent way to estimate the magnetic ﬁeld strength
is to use the soft time lag and the following expression (e.g. Pa-
padakis et al. 2003):

Bδ1/3 ≃ 300

1/3

1 + z
νR !

1 − (νR/νV )1/2
T

"

#

2/3

,

(3)

where B is in units of Gauss, νV and νR are the frequencies of
the VR-bands (in units of 1017 Hz) and T the soft time lag (in
units of seconds). Here it is assumed that the lag resulted from
synchrotron cooling of high-energy electrons to lower energies
(Chiappetti et al. 1999). We got Bδ1/3 ≃ 0.066 G if T = TCCPD
and Bδ1/3 ≃ 0.100 G if T = Tﬁt. If we use Doppler factors
of 3 and 20 then the respective values are 0.05 G and 0.02 G
using TCCPD and 0.07 G and 0.04 G using Tﬁt. The magnetic ﬁeld
strengths estimated in both ways agree well to each other as well
as with the values obtained by Tavecchio et al. (2010) for TeV
blazars by means of SED modelling.

Finally, we obtained the lower limit of the energy, γobs (in
units of mec2), of the electrons emitting at the observed frequen-
cies corresponding to VR-bands (Ghisellini et al. 1997):

γobsδ1/3 <∼ 2 × 104 ν2/3

15 [Tris (1 + US/UB) (1 + z)]1/3.

(4)

We got γobsδ1/3 <∼ 5.5 × 104 for the V-band and γobsδ1/3 <∼ 5.0 ×
104 for the R-band. So, if we use Doppler factors of 3 and 20
then the respective upper limits are 3.8 × 104 and 2.0 × 104 for
the V-band and 3.5 × 104 and 1.8 × 104 for the R-band.

4.3. Periodicityanalysis

Our periodicity analysis of the historical VR-band LCs using
three diﬀerent methods gives a median (over the methods and
VR-bands) period of [2.21 ± 0.04 (s.d.)] years, which conﬁrms
the previous ﬁndings. In addition, our results increase the num-
ber of the wavelengths at which the year-long period is detected.
This fact, coupled with the ﬁndings of Sandrinelli et al. (2018)
and Covino et al. (2020) strongly suggest that this period is real
feature in the PG 1553+113 variability pattern.

The year-long periodicity in the PG 1553+113 emission
could be explained by the jet precession in a SMBH binary sys-
tem (Sobacchi et al. 2017; Caproni et al. 2017; Tavani et al.
2018). The precession will change the jet viewing angle and,
hence, the corresponding Doppler factor. In the case of a con-
tinuous jet, the observed ﬂux is related to the intrinsic one via
F(obs) = δ (α+2)F. If the viewing angle changes because of the jet
precession then δ = δ(t) and, hence, F = F(t). We already as-
sumed that the mean spline, derived in Sect. 3.4, represents the

A&Aproofs: manuscript no. PG1553

long-term variability component of geometric origin (jet preces-
sion). So, to account for the ﬂux changes of the mean spline the
Doppler factor has to be changed up to 1.3 times relative to its
value corresponding to the minimum spline ﬂux.

We also detected a possible secondary period of ∼210 days
using the LCs corrected for the long-term variations. As long
as the ﬂux variations of the corrected LCs are achromatic, we
should rely on geometric causes of this periodicity, for example,
the emitting region follows a spiral path within the jet or the jet
itself has a helical geometry. The jet wobbling in PG 1553+113,
recently found by Lico et al. (2020) could contribute to some
extent to the periodic STV. It is worth noting that Bhatta et al.
(2016) found a secondary period of ∼400 days for the blazar
OJ 287 in addition to the main one of ∼12 years.

The update and further analysis of the historical LCs are of
substantial importance in order to conﬁrm or reject the putative
secondary period in PG 1553+113. The observed periodicity (if
we assume it is real) coupled with the observed achromatic ﬂux
variation support the geometric origin of the STV and LTV of
PG 1553+113.

Appendix B: Historical light curves

In order to study in detail the variability of PG 1553+113 on
long-term timescales, we constructed its historical LC. We used
only major public data sets, so, this LC will not include all avail-
able photometric data on the blazar.

The ﬁrst data set we considered was the one obtained at the
Steward Observatory10 of the University of Arizona. The obser-
vations were performed from 2012 to 2018 through VR ﬁlters
and were described in Smith et al. (2009). Comparing Steward
photometry to ours, we found 7 V and 9 R data points that have
been obtained either in one and the same night or in two consec-
utive nights – in all cases, the magnitude diﬀerences were less
than the corresponding uncertainties. Therefore, there is no need
the Steward photometry to be adjusted to ours and we merged
the two data sets into a basic set to which the other archival data
will be matched. After each successful matching the basic data
set is updated accordingly.

The next major VR data set comes from Itoh et al. (2016).
The observations were performed from 2008 to 2014 using the
Kanata telescope. This data set was adjusted and then added to
the basic one. We have only one common observing night, so we
were forced to use an interpolation onto the overlapping parts of
the LCs to do the inter-calibration; this procedure was favoured
by the fact that the source did not show signiﬁcant variability
during the period of interest.

The V-band LC was successively supplemented with the fol-

lowing data sets:

1. Catalina Surveys (Drake et al. 2009, The Catalina Surveys
Data Release 2). The observations have been obtained with-
out a ﬁlter from 2005 to 2014 and the photometry has been
transformed by the Catalina pipeline to V-band11. The inter-
calibration with the updated basic data set was performed on
the base of 33 observing nights in common.

2. All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae12 (ASAS-SN,
Shappee et al. 2014; Kochanek et al. 2017; Jayasinghe et al.
2019). We matched ASAS-SN photometry (taken from 2013
to 2018) to the updated basic data set using 21 nights in com-
mon.

3. The Zwicky Transient Facility13 (ZTF, Masci et al. 2019).
The data time span is from 2018 to 2019. Before adjust-
ment to the updated basic data set, the ZTF gr magnitudes
were transformed to the Johnson-Cousins VR ones. Then the
matching was done using 12 nights in common.

The following data sets were added to the R-band LC:

1. Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope14 (KAIT, Filippenko
et al. 2001). The KAIT unﬁltered magnitudes roughly corre-
spond to the R-band (Li et al. 2003, we used the results since
March 2019 from a new pipeline). The matching was done
on the base of 34 nights in common. We also added to the
historical LC the KAIT results obtained with the old pipeline
before March 2019 that are missing among the results ob-
tained with the new pipeline. The old photometry has been
calibrated with respect to the ‘R2’ magnitudes of USNO-B1
catalogue (Monet et al. 2003). In this case the matching was
done on the base of 15 nights in common. The KAIT pho-
tometry needs no adjustment before its joining to the basic
data set. The time span of KAIT data is from 2010 to 2019.

Fig. B.1: Long-term VR-band LCs for PG 1553+113. Diﬀerent
colours and symbols denote data from diﬀerent observatories
and telescopes as indicated in the plot. In particular, ‘others’
denote the data collected by the nine telescopes mentioned in
Sect. 2 The data plotted are not nightly binned.

2. Tuorla Blazar Monitoring Program15 (Takalo et al. 2008).
The observations were performed from 2005 to 2012 in the
R-band (Nilsson et al. 2018) and were adjusted to the updated
basic data set on the base of 35 nights in common.

3. Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory16 (iPTF Law et al.
2009; Rau et al. 2009). The observing time span is from 2009
to 2010 and the matching was done using four nights in com-
mon.

4. ZTF (see above). The matching was done using 18 nights in

common.

After the diﬀerent data sets were put together accounting for
the oﬀsets existing among them, nightly binning (and cleaning of
the deviant data points) was performed as described in Sect. 3.3.
The so assembled historical VR LCs for PG 1553+113 are pre-
sented in Fig. B.1. The variability amplitude of the historical VR-
band LCs is A ≃ 1.4 mag.
