ABSTRACT
Physical activity or exercise can improve people’s health and reduce
their risk of developing several diseases; most importantly, regular
activity can improve the quality of life. However, lack of time is
one of the major barriers for people doing exercise. High-intensity
interval training (HIIT) can reduce the time required for a healthy
exercise regime but also bring similar benefits of regular exercise.
We present a boxing-based VR exergame called VirusBoxing to
promote physical activity for players. VirusBoxing provides players
with a platform for HIIT and empowers them with additional abili-
ties to jab a distant object without the need to aim at it precisely.
In this paper, we discuss how we adapted the HIIT protocol and
gameplay features to empower players in a VR exergame to give
players an efficient, effective, and enjoyable exercise experience.

1 INTRODUCTION
Physical inactivity has been identified as the fourth leading cause of
death globally (6% of deaths globally), while being overweight and
obesity are responsible for 5% of global mortality [21]. These factors
are responsible for raising the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and
cancers across countries in all income groups: high, middle, and low

[21]. It has been shown that participation in regular physical activity
could not only reduces the risk of various diseases, stroke, diabetes,
but is also fundamental to energy balance and weight control [22].
Despite the known benefits of regular moderate-intensity exercise
in regulating risk factors leading to diseases, most people are still
physically inactive [20]. One of the most commonly cited barriers
for people to exercise is lack of time [2].

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) consists of alternating
short bursts of intensive aerobic exercises with periods of passive or
active low-intensity exercises [6]. These combinations could reduce
the time required for a healthy exercise regime. Studies show that
HIIT is equally beneficial or superior to traditional aerobic exercise
in many fitness and health-related measures [8, 16, 18]. Moreover,
it offers the possibility to maintain high-intensity exercise for far
more extended periods than doing continuous exercises of the same
type [3]. Therefore, employing HIIT as a training protocol could be
useful, especially for people who have limited time.

In recent years, exergames, which combines video gaming and
exercise, have been proposed as a solution to improve motivation
and long-term engagement of people with doing regular exercises
[27]. Previous literature has shown that exergames could bring
physical and mental health outcomes to players of different age
groups (e.g., older adults [30]). The benefits of playing exergames
include, but are not limited to, improved quality of life [5], acute
cognitive capabilities [7], and balance [19].

Virtual reality (VR) exergames [31, 32] with head-mounted dis-
plays (HMDs) have been gaining rapid attention. For instance, Xu et
al. [33] found that playing exergames in VR was more challenging,
immersive (with respect to flow, sensory and imaginative immer-
sion), and had a lower negative effect than in front of a 50-inch TV.
Studies have also suggested that playing exergames in VR helps
promote physical activity in sedentary and obese children [24], es-
pecially to increase their motivation to exercise [17, 23]. Moreover,
VR can give users the illusion of grater capabilities (e.g., running
and jumping), which can increase intrinsic motivation, perceived
competence and flow, and may also increase motivation for physical
activity in general [12].

We have developed a game called VirusBoxing that combines
boxing with HIIT and use VR to enable players to have additional
powers. Boxing is chosen as our exercise activity because it could
be feasible and effective with a HIIT protocol [4]. During 7 minutes
of gameplay with VirusBoxing, players are required to jab the virus
and weave the blood cell. The player could earn one energy unit
when they jab a virus in the non-empowerment condition. Once
they hit 10 viruses (i.e., when the energy bar is full), they could
choose to activate the augmented ability for 10 seconds.

2 RELATED WORK
Employing a HIIT protocol in exergame is not new. Research sug-
gested that employing a HIIT protocol could significantly increase
the energy expenditure and heart rate when compared to a non-
HIIT version [1]. Moreover, stationary cycling-based VR exergames
that employed HIIT have been found to let players achieve the re-
quired intensity for HIIT [2, 10, 14]. Applying HIIT to VR exergame
could also potentially mitigate the typical VR HMD-related issues
such as VR sickness [33], sweat and wearer discomfort [26].

There is a limited number of studies that have focused on ability
empowerment in VR. Granqvist et al. [9] explored the empowered
flexibility of the avatar in a martial arts VR game and found that a
medium degree of empowered flexibility was preferred over realism
or strong exaggeration of users’ power. Ioannou et al. [12] explored
a jump- and running-in-place application with applied forward
motion in a VR exergame and found increased immersion and mo-
tivation of players when they played with their ability empowered.
Overall, providing ability empowerment to players could be useful
in exergames.

In commercial games, BoxVR is the closest to our work. Although
the game mechanics are similar (i.e., jabbing and weaving), our
game is different in the following aspects: (1) Training protocol:
BoxVR relies on a rhythm-based training where the intensity of the
exercise may not be sufficient enough, but VirusBoxing employed
a HIIT approach, which as shown in the literature we reviewed
earlier and also our initial results (presented later in the paper),
can be effective. (2) VirusBoxing maximizes the potential of VR to
provide users ability empowerments in punching (i.e., players can
punch a distant object without precisely aiming at the target). (3)
VirusBoxing does not force players to be in the empowered ability
mode all the time; instead, it allows the player to switch on the
empowerment mode when they have enough energy.

3 OVERALL CONCEPT AND MECHANICS
VirusBoxing combines boxing-inspired workouts and HIIT protocol
for VR HMDs. In VirusBoxing, the player becomes the virus fighter
who needs to protect the world behind himself/herself from a virus
creator that is placed 15 meters away (see Fig. 1a). The virus creator
could spawn viruses (see Fig. 1b-c) and blood cells (see Fig. 1d-f)
towards the player.

The player needs to jab the virus at a certain speed (i.e., at least
1m/s in our game). There are two colors of the virus: blue viruses
can only be destroyed by a left-hand jab while red viruses can
only be destroyed by a right-hand jab. Meanwhile, the player needs
to weave blood cells in three ways (see Fig. 1d-f), either by (1)
squatting only, (2) squatting and leaning the body rightwards, or
(3) squatting and leaning the body leftwards.

The player earns one energy unit every time it successfully jabs
on a virus, and once the energy reaches the maximum number of 10
units, the player could choose to switch on the ability empowerment
mode that lass for 10 seconds, during which they could hit a distant
virus without precisely targeting at it.

The percentage of spawning a virus and a blood cell is 70% and
30%, respectively. The percentage of spawning a red virus and a
blue virus are the same (i.e., 35%). For a flat blood cell (see Fig. 1d)
is 20% and 5% for right tilted blood cell (see Fig. 1e) and left tilted
blood cell (see Fig. 1f).

4 INNOVATION
Our game includes three unique selling points when compared to
other games in the market. First, it includes a HIIT-based workout.
Second, it includes features of ability empowerment in how punches
can be performed. Third, we have invented an energy system to
activate the ability empowerment. Details of each innovation will
be described in the following subsections.

4.1 High Intensity Interval Training Protocol
Unlike BoxVR which implies a rhythm-based approach for a VR
boxing experience, our exergame employed a low volume HIIT pro-
tocol, which has the following advantages: (1) HIIT has been proved
to be effective and efficient to gain health benefits (e.g., increase
one’s exercise capacity [13]) while the benefits of a rhythm-based
approach for people’s health are unknown; (2) the HIIT protocol
suits VR particularly well since a short gameplay duration mitigates
typical HMD usability problems such as VR sickness [33], sweat and
wearer discomfort [26]; (3) it is essential for an exercise routine to
include both oxygen-dependent (aerobic) and oxygen-independent
(anaerobic) exercises [3, 25].

We employed the following protocol: 3 sessions of 30-second
low intensity and 90-second sprint, ending with a 60-second low

intensity cool down. In the low-intensity interval, the game would
spawn a game object every 0.8s and the moving speed of the game
object is 5.7 m/s. In the high-intensity interval, the game would
spawn a game object every 0.5s and the moving speed of the game
object is 8 m/s. Players need to put as much effort as possible (e.g.,
punch as heavy as they can).

4.2 Punching Empowerment in VR
Study Design. We took into account two factors when we
4.2.1
designed an empowered punching experience in VR boxing games.
The first one was the punching range, which had three levels: 1)
short-range (RA) — up to 5m, 2) medium-range (MR) — up to 10m,
and 3) long-range (LR) — up to 15m. The second factor was the need
for precise targeting, which had two levels: 1) precise targeting (PT)
— the player needs to target the virus precisely when jabbing, and
2) rough targeting (RT) — the player only need to punch with the
correct hand.

We did not test both factors in one study at one time. Instead, we
have set up two experiments for these factors with the same group
of participants on different days. The reasons are 1) we want to test
the factors that might affect the ability empowerment of punching
gradually, 2) the length of the experiment might be too long: two-
way within-subjects design of this study would ask participants to
do VR HIIT-based boxing for 42 minutes (6 conditions × 7 minutes
gameplay of each condition) excluding the time that required for
participants to fill the questionnaire and rest.

4.2.2 Participants, Apparatus, and Procedure. We recruited 12 par-
ticipants (3 female, 9 male; age 19-21, mean 19.75; 7 with previ-
ous VR experience, but only 1 was regular user and none of them
have experience with the device used in our experiment [i.e., Ocu-
lus Quest]) to join our experiments 1 and 2 to inform our design
choices. Participants were screened using the Physical Activity
Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) [28]. If a participant answered
’yes’ to any of the PAR-Q questions, they were excluded from doing
the experiment.

Participants were then asked to complete pre-experiment ques-
tionnaires to collect their demographics information and were given
information about the study and asked to fill the consent form. Par-
ticipants then had a chance to become familiar with the device
since they were all new to the Oculus Quest. When participants
felt rested and ready, they would proceed to the testing session (i.e.,
playing the 7-mins version of VirusBoxing). Conditions were coun-
terbalanced across participants. After each condition, participants
needed to complete game experience questionnaire [11] and simu-
lator sickness questionnaire [15]. At the end of each experiment,
we asked them to provide feedback on the virus spawn frequency
and flying speed, distribution of each gameobject, and ranked the
game versions.

4.2.3 Punching Range Study Results and Discussion. Gameplay per-
formance data were analyzed in the percentage of missing viruses
and the percentage of hitting blood cells during the game. The per-
centage of the missing virus was 7.03% (SD=7.08%) for SR, 15.80%
(SD=16.95%) for MR, and 8.76% (SD=8.17%) for LR. One-way Re-
peated ANOVA tests showed that there were no significant dif-
ferences between the three versions (𝐹2,22 = 2.800, 𝑝 = .083). The
percentage of hitting blood cells were 0.00% (SD=0.00%) for all
conditions, which means all players could avoid hitting all blood
cells when playing the game. We did not found any significant
difference between all three versions regarding game experience
(Competence, Tension, Sensory and Imaginative Immersion, Flow,
Negative Affect, Positive Affect, Challenge) and simulator sickness
(nausea, oculomotor, disorientation) (see Table 1). Regarding the
ranking, 8 participants preferred the LR version.

We decided to apply the LR as the punching range for the punch-
ing empowerment since the majority of participants preferred the
LR. Also, participants argued that it was difficult to predict whether
the virus has reached their punching range in SR and MR versions.

4.2.4 Targeting Condition Study Results and Discussion. In this sec-
tion, we analyze data by using pair-sample t-tests. There was a
significant effect of targeting condition (𝑡 (11) = 2.853, 𝑝 = .016)
on the percentage of missing viruses, showing that players missed
more viruses in PT (M=18.98%, SD=15.24%) than RT (M=7.12%,

SD=5.57%). Regarding game experience and simulator sickness,
paired-sample t-tests yielded a significant difference of Tension
among conditions (𝑡 (11) = 2.462, 𝑝 = .032) where RT caused sig-
nificantly lower Tension than PT. No other significant effects were
observed on game experience and simulator sickness (see Table 2).
There was no clear preference for targeting conditions from the
ranking data (i.e., each version was preferred by 6 participants).

Because players felt a lower tension (annoyed, frustrated, irrita-
ble) and had a higher gameplay performance in the RT during the
gameplay, we employed RT. In conclusion, the empowered punches
could hit a virus within 15 meters and would not require the player
to target it in a precise manner.

4.3 Energy System
Unlike the previous study where empowerment is given throughout
the game experience [12], empowerment in VirusBoxing can only
be activated when following conditions are met: 1) the energy
system is full and 2) players decide to switch on empowerment
by pressing the button ’A’ on the right controller. In order to gain
energy for empowerment, players need to jab the virus in the non-
empowerment condition.

5 PLAYTESTING
A short playtesting was conducted with 2 players. The focus here
was mainly on exertion. We employed Polar OH1 to capture the
heart rate of the player. One player (aged 19; male; regular gym
visitor — 3 or 4 times per week; body mass index: 21.1) experienced
a max heart rate of 140 beats per minute (bpm), an average of 122
bpm and burned 44kcal calories across the whole session (see Fig.
2a). The other player (aged 19; male; lack of exercise; body mass
index: 27.4) experienced a max heart rate of 149 bpm, an average of
130 bpm and burned 44kcal calories across the whole session (see
Fig. 2b). However, we could not have further participants due to
issues brought in by the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the experi-
ence seems to be effective and both players highly recommended
VirusBoxing (rated the experience to be 4 out of 5).

6 TARGET AUDIENCE
It is now well established that a sedentary lifestyle is a unique
risk factor for illnesses such as Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular
disease [29], which account for 30% of global mortality. Our game is
designed to help tackle this problem and provide our target audience
(i.e., people with a sedentary lifestyle) with a platform to let players
have short but meaningful and fun exercise experiences.

7 FUTURE WORK
Future work could focus on conducting an experiment with our
game regarding exertion with more participants and exploring the
use of PID control to maintain the player’s heart rate at a high level
in a high-intensity sprint period and help to lower the heart rate in
the recovery period.

8 CONCLUSION
This paper introduces VirusBoxing as a promising intervention of
exercise for all age groups. VirusBoxing’s design combines three
concepts to achieve a fun, effective, exercise experience: (1) A high-
intensity interval training protocol which incorporates the benefits
of exercise, (2) ability empowerment to give players the illusion of
greater capabilities than they actually have (i.e., punching a distant
object), and (3) an energy system which enriches the traditional
boxing-based VR games.
