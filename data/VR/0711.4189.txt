We have developed a variant transfer matrix method that is suitable for transport through multi-
probe systems. Using this method, we have numerically studied the quantum spin-Hall eﬀect
(QSHE) on the 2D graphene with both intrinsic (Vso) and Rashba (Vr) spin-orbit(SO) couplings.
The integer QSHE arises in the presence of intrinsic SO interaction and is gradually destroyed by
the Rashba SO interaction and disorder ﬂuctuation. We have numerically determined the phase
boundaries separating integer QSHE and spin-Hall liquid. We have found that when Vso ≥ 0.2t
with t is hopping constant, the energy gap needed for the integer QSHE is the largest satisfying
|E| < t. For smaller Vso the energy gap decreases linearly. In the presence of Rashba SO interaction
or disorders, the energy gap diminishes. With Rashba SO interaction the integer QSHE is robust
at the largest energy within the energy gap while at the smallest energy within the energy gap the
integer QSHE is insensitive to the disorders.

INTRODUCTION

of a multi-probe system using the direct method is very
calculational demanding.

Graphene is a 2-dimensional honeycomb lattice of sin-
gle atomic carbon layer and has a special band structures.
With more and more experimental discoveries and the-
oretical predictions[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], there is currently a
intense interest on electronic properties on the graphene
sheet. Especially the spin Hall eﬀect(SHE) has the po-
tential to provide a purely electrical means to control
the spins of electron in the absence of non-ferromagnetic
materials and magnetic ﬁeld[7]. This is because the spin-
orbit interaction in the Graphene exerts a torque on the
spin of electron whose precessing leads to a spin polarized
current. In a four probe device, this spin polarized cur-
rent can lead to a pure spin current without accompany-
ing charge current[8]. It has been proposed by Haldane[9]
that a quantum Hall eﬀect may exist in the absence of
magnetic ﬁeld. Similarly, integer quantum spin-Hall ef-
fect can exist on a honeycomb lattice when the intrinsic
spin orbit interaction is present[7, 10]. In the presence
of disorder the charge conductance of mesoscopic conduc-
tors show universal features with a universal conductance
ﬂuctuation[11] and the spin-Hall conductance also ﬂuc-
tuates with a universal value[12] in the presence of spin
orbit interaction. The presence of disorder can also de-
stroy the integer quantum spin-Hall eﬀect and quantum
Hall eﬀect[13] for a Graphene system with intrinsic spin
orbit interaction[7]. Hence it is of interest to map out
the phase diagram for the integer quantum spin-Hall ef-
fect. In this paper, we investigate the disorder eﬀect on
the spin Hall current for a four-probe Graphene system
in the presence of intrinsic and/or Rashba SO interac-
tions, denoted as Vso and Vr, respectively. For such a
system, the conventional transfer matrix method can not
be used. So the direct matrix inversion method must
be used to obtain the Green’s function that is needed
for the transport properties. As a result, the simulation

In this paper, we developed an algorithm based on the
idea of transfer matrix that is much faster than the direct
method. As an application, we have numerically mapped
out the phase diagram for a two dimensional honeycomb
lattice in the presence of the intrinsic and/or Rashba SO
interactions and disorders. When turning on the Rashba
SO interaction, we found that the energy gap needed
for the IQSHE is
0.2t and decreases
< t for Vso
linearly when Vso < 0.2t.
In the presence of Rashba
SO interaction, the phase diagram (E, Vr) is asymmetric
about the Fermi energy. The IQSHE is more diﬃcult
to destroy at the largest energy of the energy gap.
In
the presence of disorder, the phase diagram (E, W ) is
again asymmetric about the Fermi energy but it is the
smallest energy of the energy gap that is robust against
the disorder ﬂuctuation.

for the 2D honeycomb lattice of the graphene structure
can be written as[7, 9]:

where c†
i (ci) is electron creation (annihilation) opera-
tor and σ are Pauli matrices. The ﬁrst term is due to
the nearest hopping. The second term is the intrinsic
spin-orbit interaction that involves the next nearest sites.
Here i and j are two next nearest neighbor sites, k is the
common nearest neighbor of i and j, and dik describes a

 
 
 
 
 
 
vector pointing from k to i. The third term is due to the
Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The last term is the on-site
energy where ǫi is a random on-site potential uniformly
distributed in the interval [
W/2, W/2]. In this Hamil-
tonian, we have set the lattice constant to be unity.

n + 1 sites on ny = 4

We consider a four-probe device as shown schemati-
cally in FIG.1a. The four probes are exactly the exten-
sion from the central scattering region, i.e., the probes
are graphene ribbons. The number of sites in the scat-
tering region is denoted as N = nx
ny, where there are
n chains (FIG.1a shows
nx = 8
the cell for n = 1)[14]. We apply external bias volt-
ages Vi with i = 1, 2, 3, 4 at the four diﬀerent probes as
Vi = (v/2, 0,
v/2, 0). In the presence of Rashba SO in-
teraction, the spin is not a good quantum number. As a
result, the spin current is not conserved using the conven-
tional deﬁnition. Hence we switch oﬀ the Rashba SO in-
teraction in the 2nd and 4th probes. Similar to the setup
of Ref.[7] our setup can generate integer quantum spin
Hall eﬀect. The diﬀerence between the setup of Ref.[7]
and ours is that the lead in Ref.[7] is a square lattice
without SO interactions while our lead is still honeycomb
lattice with SO interactions except that the Rashba SO
interaction has been switched oﬀ in lead 2 and 4. The use
of the square lattice as a lead has two consequences. It
provides additional interfacial scattering between scat-
tering region and the lead due to the lattice mismatch
and the mismatch in SO interactions. In addition, the
dimension of the self-energy matrix for the square lattice
lead with SO interaction is much smaller. The spin-Hall
conductance GsH can be calculated from the multi-probe
Landauer-Buttiker formula[8, 12]:

GsH = (e/8π)[(T2↑,1

T2↓,1)

(T2↑,3

−

T2↓,3)]

(2)

where the transmission coeﬃcient is given by T2σ,1 =
T r(Γ2σGrΓ1Ga) with Gr,a being the retarded and ad-
vanced Green functions of the central disordered region
which can be evaluated numerically. The quantities Γiσ
are the linewidth functions describing coupling of the
probes and the scattering region and are obtained by
calculating self-energies Σr due to the semi-inﬁnite leads
using a transfer matrices method[15]. In the following,
our numerical data are mainly on a system with n = 8 or
65 sites in the system. To ﬁx units, throughout this
32
paper, we deﬁne the Fermi-energy E, disorder strength
W , intrinsic spin-orbit coupling Vso and Rashba spin-
orbit coupling Vr in terms of the hopping energy t.

×

For the four-probe device, the conventional transfer
matrix that is suitable for two-probe devices can no
longer be used. Below, we provide a modiﬁed transfer
matrix method for the four-probe device. Note that the
self-energy Σr is a matrix with non-zero elements at those
positions corresponding to the interface sites between a
lead and the scattering region[16]. Because evaluating
the Green’s function Gr corresponds to the inversion of
a matrix, a reasonable numbering scheme to the lattice

2

sites can minimize the bandwidth of the matrix and thus
reduce the cost of numerical computation. For example,
to obtain the narrowest bandwidth for our system we
partition the system into layers shown in FIG.1b so that
there is no coupling between the next nearest layers. We
then label each site layer by layer from the center of the
Σr
system (see FIG.1a). As a result, the matrix E
becomes a block tri-diagonal matrix:

To test the speed of this algorithm, we have calculated
the spin Hall conductance for the four-probe graphene
system with diﬀerent system size labeled by n on a mat-
lab platform. The calculation is done at a ﬁxed energy
and for 1000 random conﬁgurations. The cpu times are
listed in Table 1 where speed of direct matrix inversion
and the algorithm just described are compared. We see
that the speed up factor increases as the system size in-
creases. For instance, for n = 8 which corresponds to
2080 sites (amounts to a 4016
4016 matrix) in the scat-
tering region, a factor of 100 is gained in speed. We note
that in the presence of intrinsic SO interaction the cou-
pling involves next nearest neighbor interaction. This
is the major factor that slows down our algorithm. As
shown in TABLE 1, for a square lattice without intrin-
sic SO interaction but with Rashba SO interaction, the
speed up factor is around 200 for a 40
40 system (matrix
dimension 3200). The new algorithm is particular useful
when the large number of disorder samples and diﬀerent
sample sizes are needed for the calculation of the con-
ductance ﬂuctuation and its scaling with size. Finally,
we wish to mention that this algorithm also applies to
multi-probe systems such as six-probe systems.

It has been shown that in the presence of disorder or
Rashba SO interaction the QSHE may be destroyed[7].
As an application of our algorithm, we study the phase
phase boundary between regimes of the integer QSHE
regime and the QSH liquid in the presence of disorder.
For this purpose, we set a criteria for the QSH, i.e., if
GsH
0.999 we say it reaches an integer quantum spin
Hall plateau (IQSH). Since the integer QSHE is due to
the presence of intrinsic SOI, we ﬁrst study the phase dia-
gram of a clean sample in the absence of Rashba SOI, i.e.,
the two-component Haldane’s model[9]. For this model,
there is an energy gap within which the IQSH eﬀect ex-
ists. FIG.2 depicts the phase diagram in (E,Vso) plane
with a curve separates the integer QSHE and SHE liq-
uid. We see that the phase diagram is symmetric about
the Fermi energy E and the integer QSHE exists only
for energy E < 1 that corresponds to the energy gap.
FIG.2 shows that the energy gap depends on the strength
of intrinsic SO interaction. When Vso
0.2 the en-
≥
ergy gap is the largest between E = [
1, 1] while for
Vso < 0.2, the energy gap gradually diminishes to zero
in a linear fashion. Our numerical data show that for
Vso < 0.025 the IQSHE disappears (see FIG.2). Between
Vso = [0.025, 0.18] the phase boundary is a linear curve.
When Vso > 0.20, the phase boundary becomes a sharp
vertical line.

−

For Haldane’s model, the σz is a good quantum num-
ber. However, in the presence of Rashba SOI the spin
experiences a spin torque while traversing the system.

This can destroy the IQSHE at large enough Rashba
SOI strength Vr. In FIG.3, we show the spin-Hall con-
ductance GsH vs Fermi energy at diﬀerence Vr when
Vso = 0.1, 0.2. In FIG.3a we see that when Vr = 0, the
spin-Hall conductance is quantized between E =
0.52
and +0.52. As Vr increases to 0.1, and the energy gap de-
0.22 and 0.51. Upon further increasing Vr to
creases to
0.2 and 0.3, the gaps shrink to, respectively, [0.06, 0.50]
and [0.34, 0.46]. In Ref.[7] the IQSHE is completely de-
stroyed when Vr = 0.3 which is diﬀerent from our re-
sult. The diﬀerence is due to the lead used in Ref.[7]
that causes additional scattering. The larger intrinsic
SO interaction strength Vso, the more diﬃcult to destroy
the integer QSHE as can be seen from FIG.3b.

−

−

In the presence of Rashba SO interaction the phase dia-
gram in (E, Vr) plane at diﬀerent intrinsic SO interaction
strengths is shown in FIG.4. We see that the phase dia-
gram is asymmetric about the Fermi energy and it is more
diﬃcult to destroy the integer QSHE for largest positive
energies within the energy gap, e.g., near E = 0.51 when
Vso = 0.1. Similar to FIG.2, we see that when Vso > 0.2
integer QSHE can exist for all energies as long as
< 1.
Roughly speaking, the energy gap decreases linearly with
increasing of Rashba SOI and there is a threshold Vr be-
yond which the integer QSHE disappears. For instance,
when Vr > 0.3 and Vso = 0.1, the integer QSHE is de-
stroyed.

From the above analysis, we see that Vso = 0.2 is
an important point separating two diﬀerent behaviors
in (E, Vso) and (E, Vr) phase diagrams. Now we ex-
amine the eﬀect of disorder on the QSHE. FIG.5 shows
the phase diagram of integer QSHE on (E, W ) at two
typical intrinsic SO interaction strengths Vso = 0.1 and
Vso = 0.2. The phase diagrams are asymmetric about the
Fermi energy. Generally speaking, the larger the Rashba
SO interaction strength Vr, the smaller the energy gap
needed for integer QSHE. We already see from FIG.4
that the integer QSHE is more robust against Rashba SO
interaction strength Vr at positive Fermi energy within
In contrast, it is small Fermi energies

within the energy gap that are stable against the disor-
der ﬂuctuation, especially for large Rashba SO interac-
tion strength. In addition, the phase boundary at posi-
tive Fermi energy are not very sensitive to the variation
of Rashba SO interaction strength. The larger the in-
trinsic SO interaction, the larger the disorder strength
Wc needed to destroy the integer QSHE. In FIG.6, we
estimate this critical disorder strength Wc and plot it vs
Vso for E = 0.01 and Vr = 0.

If we replace the Rashba SO interaction by the Dres-
selhaus SO interaction, we have numerically conﬁrmed
that the phase diagram of IQSHC in (E, W ) plane is the

In summary, we have developed variant transfer matrix
method that is suitable for multi-probe systems. With
this algorithm, the speed gained is of a factor 100 for a
system of 2080 sites with the next nearest SO interac-
tion on a honeycomb lattice. For the square lattice with
Rashba SO interaction, the speed gained is around 200
40 system. Using this algorithm, we have stud-
for a 40
ied the phase diagrams of the graphene with intrinsic and
Rashba SO interaction in the presence of disorder.
