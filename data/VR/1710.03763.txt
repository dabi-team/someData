ABSTRACT
We use data from the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) and the Tycho-Gaia as-
trometric solution catalogue (TGAS) to compute the velocity ﬁelds yielded by the
radial (VR), azimuthal (Vφ) and vertical (Vz) components of associated Galactocen-
tric velocity. We search in particular for variation in all three velocity components
with distance above and below the disc midplane, as well as how each component
of Vz (line-of-sight and tangential velocity projections) modiﬁes the obtained vertical
structure. To study the dependence of velocity on proper motion and distance we use
two main samples: a RAVE sample including proper motions from the Tycho -2, PP-
MXL and UCAC4 catalogues, and a RAVE-TGAS sample with inferred distances and
proper motions from the TGAS and UCAC5 catalogues. In both samples, we identify
asymmetries in VR and Vz. Below the plane we ﬁnd the largest radial gradient to be
∂VR/∂R = −7.01±0.61 km s−1 kpc−1, in agreement with recent studies. Above the plane
we ﬁnd a similar gradient with ∂VR/∂R = −9.42 ± 1.77 km s−1 kpc−1. By comparing our
results with previous studies, we ﬁnd that the structure in Vz is strongly dependent
on the adopted proper motions. Using the Galaxia Milky Way model, we demon-
strate that distance uncertainties can create artiﬁcial wave-like patterns. In contrast
to previous suggestions of a breathing mode seen in RAVE data, our results support
a combination of bending and breathing modes, likely generated by a combination of
external or internal and external mechanisms.

1 INTRODUCTION

To a ﬁrst approximation, the Milky Way disc is assumed to
be axisymmetric and in equilibrium (e.g. Reid et al. 2009;
McMillan & Binney 2010; Gnedin et al. 2010). However,
in the last two decades with the acquisition of high-quality
spectroscopic and astrometric data, and expansion of the
surveyed volume around the Sun, non-negligible deviations
from axisymmetry have become apparent. One indication
of such asymmetries came from the clear identiﬁcation in
data from the Hipparcos astrometric satellite (Perryman
& ESA 1997) of overdensities in the velocity space of lo-
cal stars (Dehnen 1998; Chereul et al. 1998; Asiain et al.
1999). Subsequent analysis of the local velocity ﬁeld have re-
vealed that the most prominent moving groups (or streams)
in the solar neighbourhood probably have a dynamical ori-
gin since within a given stream there is a mixture of chem-
ical abundances and ages (e.g. Famaey et al. 2005; Antoja
et al. 2008; Famaey et al. 2008). Dehnen (2000) and Fux
(2001) showed that the Galactic bar can successfully repro-
duce the Hercules stream if the Sun is situated close to the
bar’s outer Lindblad resonance (OLR), while a solar position
near the inner ultra-harmonic 4:1 resonance of a two-armed
spiral density wave can similarly create resonant structures
consistent with the Pleiades/Hyades and Coma Berenices
moving groups (Quillen & Minchev 2005; Pomp´eia et al.
2011). While internal perturbations can explain the low-
velocity moving groups, high-velocity streams (such as Arc-
turus, which lags the local standard of rest by ∼ 100 km s−1;
Williams et al. 2009), have been related to external per-
turbations from an infalling satellite galaxy (Minchev et al.
2009; G´omez et al. 2012a, 2012b; D’Onghia et al. 2016).
A crucial diagnostic in understanding what causes these
streaming motions is how structure of the velocity space
varies with location in the disc (Dehnen 2001; Minchev et al.
2010; Antoja et al. 2014; McMillan 2013; Monari et al. 2017).
Another manifestation of non-axisymmetries in the
Milky Way disc is in-plane stellar streaming motions de-
tected in the extended solar neighborhood. Using line-of-
sight velocities measured in the Radial Velocity Experiment
(RAVE; Steinmetz et al. 2006) Siebert et al. (2011b) mea-
sured a gradient in the mean Galactocentric radial veloc-
ity (|∂ (cid:104)VR(cid:105) /∂R| (cid:38) 3 km s−1 kpc−1). Siebert et al. (2012) at-
tributed this gradient to a two-armed spiral perturbation
in which the Sun is again close to the inner ultra-harmonic
4:1 resonance. More recently, Monari et al. (2014) used test-
particle simulations to show that the radial gradient found
in RAVE could alternatively be caused by the Galactic bar.
In addition to stellar bulk motions in the disc plane,
structure has been found also in the direction perpendicu-
lar to the Galactic disc. Widrow et al. (2012) and Williams
et al. (2013, hereafter W13) used SEGUE (Yanny et al. 2009)
and RAVE, respectively, to detect a wave-like pattern in the
mean vertical velocity of stars near the Sun. Similar vertical
asymmetries were also found by Carlin et al. (2013) using
data from the LAMOST survey (Cui et al. 2012) and Xu
et al. (2015) with data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(Aihara et al. 2011).

While the radial velocity gradient has been associated
with internal perturbations, the origin of vertical velocity
structure is debatable. G´omez et al. (2013) attributed the
vertical patterns to the passing of the Sagittarius dwarf

galaxy (Ibata et al. 1994), while Widrow et al. (2014) noted
that they could also be caused by a dark matter subhalo. In
addition to external perturbations, vertical streaming mo-
tions have now been shown to result also from internal mech-
anisms such as the Galactic bar (Monari et al. 2015) and spi-
ral arms (Faure et al. 2014; Monari et al. 2016). However,
according to Monari et al. (2015), the Galactic bar is unlikely
to induce mean vertical motions greater than ∼ 0.5 km s−1 in
the outer disc, and therefore does not explain the observed
vertical motions in the solar neighbourhood.

Another possible explanation of the observed vertical
motions is the Galactic warp. The Galactic disc becomes
warped beyond the solar circle: the HI disc at R >
∼ 10 kpc is
warped such that the Sun lies near the line of nodes and
the z coordinate of the centre of the gas layer increases in
the direction of Galactic rotation (Binney & Merriﬁeld 1998;
Levine et al. 2006; Kalberla et al. 2007). Consequently, if (as
is likely) the pattern speed of the warp is smaller than the
circular frequency of the Sun, gas at R > R0 and the Sun’s
azimuth should be moving downwards (Vz < 0). A warp in
the stellar disc has been detected from R0 outwards (e.g.
Dehnen 1998; Drimmel & Spergel 2001; Robin et al. 2008).
Nonetheless, Poggio et al. (2017) used OB stars and proper
motions from Hipparcos and Gaia DR1 (Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2016b) to develop a simple model of a stable long-lived
warp and found that vertical motions in the disc cannot be
explained by the warp, suggesting that the warp’s kinematic
signal could be overwhelmed by other systematic motions.
More generally, the analysis of 16 high-resolution, fully
cosmological simulations of the evolution of individual Milky
Way-sized galaxies led G´omez et al. (2016) to conclude that
vertical disc asymmetries are ubiquitous in ΛCDM cosmol-
ogy. In fact, ∼ 70% of the analysed simulations exhibited
strong vertical patterns, with amplitudes exceeding 2 kpc
from the disc midplane. Hence vertical motions are predicted
by ΛCDM cosmology.

Using RAVE red-clump stars and a compilation of
proper motions, W13 studied the 3D velocity distribution
in the extended solar neighbourhood, focusing on north-
south diﬀerences, and detected a rarefaction-compression
behaviour in the vertical velocity pattern. Such a pattern,
which has odd parity in the Vz distribution and even parity
in the density distribution, is known as a breathing mode.
In contrast, even parity in Vz with odd parity in the den-
sity distribution is known as a bending mode. By identify-
ing the observed mode, we hope to constrain the nature of
the exciting perturber. Breathing modes have been found to
be induced naturally by the Galactic bar and spiral arms
(Faure et al. 2014; Monari et al. 2015; Monari et al. 2016),
whereas bending modes are attributed mainly to external
perturbations. While more recently, Chequers & Widrow
(2017) found that bending waves could also arise without
excitation by a satellite/merging event, Widrow et al. (2014)
used a toy-model simulation of disc-satellite interactions to
show that a passing satellite galaxy could produce bend-
ing or breathing modes depending on the vertical velocity
of the satellite as it passes through the Galactic disc. This
shows that the picture can actually be rather complex, as
external perturbations also generate internal spiral pertur-
bations which can in turn excite breathing modes. While
both bending and breathing modes can arise from external
interactions, the observations so far have been found con-

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2017)

sistent with a breathing mode. Another interpretation was
found by de la Vega et al. (2015), who showed that phase-
wrapping in the disc following the passage of a satellite, can
look very similar to a bending or a breathing mode.

ESA’s mission Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016a)
is acquiring highly accurate parallaxes and proper motions
for over a billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7 in
the G band. In this paper, we use early mission data from
the ﬁrst data release (Gaia DR1) combined with the line-of-
sight velocities of the ﬁfth data release from RAVE (DR5;
Kunder et al. 2017) to study the three-dimensional velocity
distribution of stars in the extended solar neighbourhood.
We extend the analysis of W13 by increasing the number
of stars through inclusion of stars that are not in the red-
clump and using better proper motions and distances. Since
uncertainties in velocity ﬁelds are dominated by errors in
distance and proper motion (RAVE uncertainty in line-of-
sight velocity < 2 km s−1), our goal is to use proper motions
from Gaia to scrutinize with higher accuracy the vertical
velocity pattern of the extended solar neighbourhood. In this
way we aim to determine whether the Milky Way exhibits a
breathing or a bending mode.

This paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we
introduce our coordinate conventions and explain how we
selected stars. In Section 3, we present the radial, azimuthal
and vertical velocity distribution obtained by W13 and the
velocity distributions obtained from RAVE DR5 and dif-
ferent proper-motion catalogues. In Section 4 we study the
composition of the vertical velocity pattern and how errors
aﬀect its structure. In Section 5, we examine the diﬀerences
between RAVE DR5 and samples that use data from DR5
combined with the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution cata-
logue (RAVE-TGAS samples) and present the north-south
asymmetries obtained using the most accurate estimates of
distance and proper motion. Finally, Section 6 contains a
summary of our results and conclusions.

2 COORDINATE SYSTEMS & DATA

SELECTION

2.1 Coordinate systems

We compute the heliocentric rectangular components of the
Galactic space velocity U, V and W using the right-handed
coordinate system, with U positive towards the Galactic cen-
tre, V positive in the direction of Galactic rotation and W
positive towards the north Galactic pole. The method used
to derive the Galactic space velocities is described in detail
in Johnson & Soderblom (1987). The Galactocentric cylin-
drical velocity components (VR, Vφ and Vz ) are computed
following the coordinate transformation given in Appendix
A of W13.

For the solar Galactocentric distance, we adopt R0 =
8 kpc (Reid 1993) and use the estimate of the peculiar ve-
locity of the Sun obtained by Sch¨onrich et al. (2010):
(U, V, W)(cid:12) = (11.1, 12.24, 7.25) km s−1

(1)

With these values and the proper motion of Sagittarius A*,
µlSgr A∗ = 6.379 mas yr−1 (Reid & Brunthaler 2004), we
obtain:
V(cid:12) + VLSR = 4.74 R0 µlSgr A∗ ,

which yields a value of VLSR ∼ 230 km s−1 for the circular
velocity of the local standard of rest (LSR). We also tested
our results with R0 = 8.3 kpc and VLSR = 240 km s−1. The
changes in VR and Vφ were negligible, and since Vz is inde-
pendent of VLSR it suﬀers no changes aside from the position
in R.

2.2 RAVE data selection

RAVE is a spectroscopic magnitude-limited (9 (cid:46) I (cid:46) 12)
southern hemisphere survey, which collected data from 2003
to 2013. It acquired line-of-sight velocities and stellar param-
eters (eﬀective temperature, surface gravity, overall metallic-
ity) in order to probe the chemical and dynamical evolution
of the Milky Way. In this paper we use its latest data re-
lease, Data Release 5 (Kunder et al. 2017). DR5 contains
520,781 spectra of 457,588 unique stars. It includes observa-
tions that were previously discarded, resulting in ∼ 30, 000
more spectra than the fourth data release (DR4; Kordopatis
et al. 2013a). DR5 also improves on the distance pipeline of
DR4 (Binney et al. 2014), especially as regards metal-poor
stars, and applies a new calibration of its stellar parame-
ters that improves their accuracy by up to 15% compared
to DR4 (See Section 6 in Kunder et al. 2017 for details).
The proper motions in DR5 are taken from the Tycho -2
(Høg et al. 2000), PPMXL (Roeser et al. 2010) and UCAC4
(Zacharias et al. 2013) catalogues.

For our data selection (RAVE sample), we exclude stars
without measured proper motions and stars with a proper
motion error σµα, σµδ > 15 mas yr−1 (catalogue indepen-
dent) to remove outliers. Further cuts applied were to in-
clude only stars with a signal-to-noise ratio SNRK > 20 and
to remove stars whose spectral morphological ﬂag indicates
peculiar spectra (c1,c2,c3 (cid:44) ’n’); these cuts improve the qual-
ity of our data and remove most spectroscopic binaries, spec-
tra with continuum abnormalities and other unusual spec-
tra. We also removed stars with an error of heliocentric ra-
dial velocity eHRV > 10 km s−1, cool dwarfs (log g > 3.5 and
Teﬀ < 4000 K), metal poor stars ([M/H] < −1.2 dex), hot
stars (Teﬀ > 7400 K) and spectra for which atmospheric pa-
rameters could not be determined reliably (Algoconv = 1),
since in that case, the derived distances (obtained through
isochrone ﬁtting, see Binney et al. 2014) were not reliable
either.

Finally, stars at Galactic latitude |b| < 10◦ were re-
moved due to uncertain interstellar extinctions possibly af-
fecting the derived distances. Our data selection applies
to all proper-motion catalogues, with the exception of the
Galactic latitude cut for the PPMXL catalogue, from which
we remove all stars with |b| < 20◦. This cut was suggested by
Vickers et al. (2016), who presented a correction to the PP-
MXL proper motions. Although we do not make use of the
code provided to correct the proper motions, the Galactic
latitude cut solves the high discrepancy between the veloc-
ity ﬁelds of PPMXL and all other catalogues. The applied
cuts produce, respectively, samples of 173,162; 116,632 and
105,331 stars when UCAC4, PPMXL and Tycho -2 proper
motions are used. The adopted distance of each star is the
inverse of the expectation of the star’s parallax, which Bin-
ney et al. (2014) recommended as the most reliable distance
estimate.

velocity ﬁeld is shown in (0.1 kpc)2 pixels covering a box of up to (5 kpc)2 around the Sun, which we locate at (R, z)=(8,0) kpc. All pixels
are smoothed by computing the median of the velocities of all stars located in a square of size (0.2 kpc)2 with a minimum of 50 stars.
For comparison purposes, the bottom right panel shows the velocity ﬁeld obtained by Kordopatis et al. (2013b) which is very similar to
the one obtained using only RC stars by Williams et al. (2013). The velocity ﬁelds of all proper motions are consistent with a decrease
of Vφ with increasing distance from the plane.

2.3 The Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution

catalogue

An important aspect of RAVE DR5 is that with almost
256,000 spectra that overlap with a TGAS star, this data
release currently has a larger overlap with the Tycho-Gaia
astrometric solution (TGAS) catalogue than any other spec-
troscopic survey. TGAS is the primary astrometric data set
included in Gaia DR1, which includes proper motions, sky
positions and parallaxes of 2,057,050 stars from the Hip-
parcos (Perryman & ESA 1997; van Leeuwen 2007) and
Tycho -2 catalogues. In addition to the TGAS proper mo-
tions and positions, we use two distance estimates for our
RAVE-TGAS sample: the purely astrometric distances of
Astraatmadja & Bailer-Jones (2016) (ABJ), which employ

an anisotropic prior based on a three-dimensional density
model of the Milky Way, and the improved RAVE spec-
trophotometric distances from McMillan et al. (2017), which
take advantage of both TGAS parallaxes and eﬀective tem-
peratures from the Infrared Flux Method (IRFM; Blackwell
et al. 1979; Casagrande et al. 2010).

The RAVE-TGAS sample with McMillan distances in-
volves a cut additional to those listed in Section 2.2: we re-
moved stars with log g < 2, because distances to low-gravity
stars are systematically overestimated (see McMillan et al.
2017). The data selection results in a sample of 68,477 stars.
For the RAVE-TGAS sample with ABJ distances we use
the selection criteria described in Section 2.2 less the cuts
on heliocentric velocity error, eﬀective temperature, metal-
licity, surface gravity or the convergence of the atmospheric

parameters, because the ABJ distance estimates do not rely
on the accuracy of the atmospheric parameters. The RAVE-
TGAS sample with ABJ distances comprises 184,954 stars.
To further study the proper motion diﬀerences in
the RAVE-TGAS samples, we include the newly obtained
UCAC5 (Zacharias et al. 2017) proper motions, which were
derived by combining UCAC data with Gaia DR1.

in Kordopatis et al. (2013b). We apply the same cuts de-
scribed in Section 2.2. The data selection results in a sample
of 127,722 stars (Williams/Kordopatis sample). The result-
ing velocity ﬁelds diﬀer mainly from W13 in being based on
the full RAVE sample instead of only red-clump stars. This
allows for a better comparison to the velocity ﬁelds obtained
with our RAVE samples.

3 RAVE FIFTH DATA RELEASE

W13 studied the diﬀerences in the Galactocentric velocity
distributions for stars above and below the Galactic plane.
For this, they used a sample of 72,635 red-clump stars ob-
tained from the RAVE internal third data release (Siebert
et al. 2011a). For comparison purposes, we use a similar
data set obtained from the internal fourth data release used

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2017)

In addition to the advantages of using RAVE DR5 data
over RAVE DR4 (see Section 2.2), a further improvement to
previous works is the choice of proper motions used to com-
pute the velocity ﬁelds. Indeed, W13 and Kordopatis et al.
(2013b) used an inhomogeneous compilation of proper mo-
tion values, a remnant of RAVE-DR3 approach; for a star
present simultaneously in several proper motion catalogues
available at the time, the proper motion with the small-
est reported uncertainty was adopted. However, it is to be
feared that combining proper motions measured with diﬀer-

locity for each proper motion catalogue, as well as the one
obtained by Williams/Kordopatis. The velocity maps are
displayed in (0.1 kpc)2 pixels covering up to 3 kpc from
the Sun. Each pixel is smoothed by computing the median
velocities over a box of (0.2 kpc)2 with a minimum of 50
stars. The main characteristic observed in Vφ is the asym-
metric drift. Figure 1 displays a symmetrical distribution
of velocity in the northern and southern Galactic hemi-
spheres, with velocities lagging that of the LSR more at
larger distance from the Galactic plane. In all proper-motion
samples, Vφ behaves similarly to the results obtained by
Williams/Kordopatis, which used a compilation of proper-
motion catalogues: within 0 < |z| < 0.5 kpc the median Vφ is
in the order of 220 km s−1 and decreases with distance from
the plane to 190 km s−1 at |z| ≈ 1 kpc and up to 130 km s−1
at |z| ≈ 2 kpc.

The dependence of VR on proper motion is presented in
Fig. 2. Inwards of the solar radius, independent of the proper
motion catalogue used, stars both above and below the plane
move away from the Galactic centre with median velocities
up to VR = 30 km s−1. Below the plane in the range −1 <
z < 0 kpc, we estimate the largest radial velocity gradient
in the Williams/Kordopatis velocity ﬁeld to be ∂VR/∂R =
−7.98 ± 0.87 km s−1 kpc−1, a value similar to that found by
Siebert et al. (2011b). Above the plane in the range 0 <
z < 1 kpc, R (cid:46) 8 kpc, we estimate the largest value to be
∂VR/∂R = −9.08 ± 1.48 km s−1 kpc−1. In Table 1 we report
the largest VR gradients obtained from each proper motion
catalogue. The (R, z) planes used to obtain these gradients
are presented in Fig. 3.

The radial gradients in the northern and southern
Galactic hemispheres are consistent with one another within
1σ. Thus, with these subsamples, we ﬁnd no North-South
variation in the strength of the gradient within 8 kpc. Con-
sistent with the gradient reported by Siebert et al. (2011b)
and Anguiano et al. (2017), the gradients lie in the range
∼ 5 − 10 km s−1 kpc−1.

Unlike VR, Vz depends largely on proper motions, which
are vulnerable to catalogue systematics and distance errors.
Fig. 4 illustrates the strong dependence of the vertical ve-
locity structure on the proper-motion catalogue used. Inside
the solar radius, all velocity ﬁelds feature a positive stellar
motion above the plane. The velocity ﬁelds obtained with
Tycho -2 and PPMXL show similar structure to that ob-
tained by Williams/Kordopatis: inside the solar radius we
see upward stellar motion above the plane and downward

set. Consequently, in this work, we do not mix the catalogues
and use individual proper motions. The data presented here,
with more homogeneous proper motions and better distance
estimates, therefore yield velocities that are less systemati-
cally biased than the ones presented in W13 and Kordopatis
et al. (2013b).

motion below it. By contrast, at R < R0, the UCAC4 ve-
locity ﬁeld shows upward motion both above and below the
plane. Hence inside the solar radius the PPMXL, Tycho -2
and Williams/Kordopatis velocity ﬁelds have the signature
of a breathing mode as discussed by Widrow et al. (2012,
2014), while the UCAC4 shows that of a bending mode.

Outside the solar radius, gradients in Vz are weaker. PP-
MXL and Tycho 2 show no clear signature, while UCAC4
and Williams/Kordopatis show weak evidence for opposite
patterns: in UCAC4 there appears to be upward motion
above the plane and downward motion below it, while the
Williams/Kordopatis ﬁeld shows oppositely directed veloc-
ities. Either pattern would be characteristic of a breathing
mode.

Although the combination of breathing and bending
modes outside and inside R0 shown by UCAC4 has not pre-

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2017)

viously been reported in the literature, it could arise from a
combination of external and internal excitations. For exam-
ple, de la Vega et al. (2015) used non-interacting test-particle
integrations to study the eﬀects of a dwarf galaxy passage
on the stellar epicyclic motions and the resulting streaming
caused by the subsequent phase-wrapping. Since their simu-
lations lacked of self-gravity, structures could not arise from
bending or breathing modes. Nonetheless, the velocity dis-
tribution observed at an azimuthal angle Θ = 270◦ in their
Figure 8 is consistent with the streaming motions caused by
a combination of breathing and bending mode.

However, the observed dependence of vertical velocity
on proper motions indicates the need for more accurate data.
The ESA Gaia mission is thus crucial in understanding the
origins of the vertical streaming motions observed in the
Milky Way.

Eq. 3. The bottom panels show the contributions to Vb cos b (distance, proper motion and solar motion) from Eq. 4. These panels indicate
how each component could aﬀect the map of Vz . The transverse velocity depends mainly on the proper motion with an amplitude that
increases with distance.

4 DECOMPOSITION OF THE VERTICAL

VELOCITY PATTERN

In this Section, before studying how the more precise Gaia
data aﬀects the vertical velocity pattern as a whole, we study
the composition of the vertical velocity and the contribution
of each component in the observed structure. In Johnson &
Soderblom (1987) the Galactocentric vertical velocity Vz is
obtained by computing the heliocentric velocity and adjust-
ing for the solar motion afterwards. However, by using the
transverse velocity in Galactic coordinates (Vl, Vb) and ap-
plying the solar motion correction before computing Vz , we
are able to separate the vertical velocity in two components
– one involving the line-of-sight velocity corrected by the so-

lar motion, Vlos, and the other dependent on the distance,
d, and the proper motion, µ. The Galactocentric vertical
velocity is thus given by:

Vz = Vlos sin b + Vb cos b

where

(3)

Vb = 4.74 d µb + (−U(cid:12) cos l sin b − V(cid:12) sin l sin b + W(cid:12) cos b).
(4)

Since the small uncertainty in Vlos from RAVE does not
aﬀect the Vz pattern, we are in a position to study how dis-
tance and proper motion aﬀect the vertical velocity. First,
we want to avoid the eﬀects of disc perturbations. For this

we used Galaxia (Sharma et al. 2011) as a front end for the
(axisymmetric) Besan¸con Galaxy Model (Robin et al. 2003).
Galaxia uses isochrones from the Padova database to com-
pute photometric magnitudes for the model stars (Bertelli
et al. 1994; Marigo et al. 2008) and it quickly generates from
models mock observational catalogues that cover a speciﬁed
area on the sky with any speciﬁed selection function. We
use the Galaxia sample that was generated by Wojno et al.
(2017) to obtain a mock stellar sample based on the RAVE
selection function.

Figure 5 shows the median vertical velocity obtained
from the mock RAVE sample and its components. The top
panels display Vz considering all components (left), only
Vlos sin b (middle) and Vb cos b (right, see Eq. 3). Here, we
are able to identify, in dilute form, the main patterns in Vz ,
in which at R < 8 kpc Vlos sin b is negative above the plane
and positive below it, and at R > 8 kpc is positive above the
plane and negative below it. As expected, such a pattern

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2017)

alone does not match any of the Vz patterns found in Fig. 4,
indicating a stronger proper motion/distance dependence.
The top right panel of Fig. 5 does display key aspects of the
pattern visible in the W/K panel of Fig. 4, suggesting that in
W13 errors may have caused the proper-motion component
of Vz to dominate the more precise contribution from Vlos.
The Vz subcomponents shown in the top middle and top
right panels have an inverse symmetry, which results in the
structure-free velocity ﬁeld when summed up to estimate Vz
(top left panel).

In the bottom panels of Fig. 5, we show how the dis-
tance, proper motion and solar motion aﬀect the transverse
velocity component Vb cos b (Eq. 4). In the bottom left panel
we set µb = 1 mas yr−1 in the Vb cos b term and don’t con-
sider the solar motion. This displays the eﬀects of distance
on Vb, where higher velocities are found at larger distances.
Similarly, in the bottom middle panel we set d = 1 kpc and
exclude the solar motion term, in order to see the eﬀects

Figure 7. Median Vz obtained from the Galaxia RAVE-like sample together with the eﬀects of adding random errors in d and µ as
described in the text. The second panel shows that by adding a random error in µ the Vz pattern displays some clumps, while the third
panel shows that adding distance errors substantially changes the map. The combination of both errors in the last panel results in a
pattern similar to the one obtained by Williams/Kordopatis.

of µb alone. Here, it is shown that the proper motions con-
tribute mainly with negative velocities aside from the vol-
ume below the plane at R > 8 kpc. Finally, the right bottom
panel displays only the contribution to Vb from the solar
motion. In all panels, the obtained structure is better un-
derstood by looking at Eq. 3 and Eq. 4. The term with cos b
in the transverse velocity component gives always a positive
value, so the negative structure is given by Vb. Here, the
velocity pattern dependent on distance is also positive since
distances are inherently positive. In contrast, the proper mo-
tions and the solar motion have negative values, with the so-
lar motion remaining relatively constant between samples.
The diﬀerent Vb patterns are thus dependent mainly on the
proper motions, with the distance increasing its amplitude.
This can be seen in Fig. 6, which displays the components of
Vz in the Williams/Kordopatis sample. Here, although the
pattern obtained from the distance has lower velocities than
in Galaxia, the pattern of proper motions is strong enough
to dominate the contribution from Vlos, breaking the balance
previously shown in Galaxia and generating the pattern of
a breathing mode.

In Fig. 7 we study the eﬀects of introducing errors to
the mock data from the axisymmetric and relaxed Galaxia
model. The ﬁrst panel shows the Galaxia sample with no
errors. In the second panel we introduce artiﬁcial errors and
draw new velocity values, from a normal distribution centred
on the actual velocity and σµ = 5 mas yr−1. Although these
errors are larger than the typical error in our DR5 samples
(cid:11) ∼ 4 mas yr−1), the assigned values produce some
(up to (cid:10)σµ
clumps but do not aﬀect the general structure of the sample.

The third panel shows the eﬀect of adding a random
distance error with a standard deviation σd/d = 0.8 (we
chose such large errors to show a clear pattern, although
this is already seen with σd/d = 0.5). This random error
increases the volume of our sample and, since all distance
values are positive, increases the value of the Vb component
(Eq. 4). This results in a pattern similar to the one obtained

by Williams/Kordopatis. The right panel displays a stronger
more noisy pattern as a combination of both random errors.
The obtained patterns in this Section allow us to understand
better how each component aﬀects Vz . In Section 5 we will
analyse how this compares to our RAVE-TGAS sample.

5 RAVE-TGAS SAMPLE

The superior parallaxes and proper motions obtained by the
ESA Gaia mission should yield marked improvements on the
velocity ﬁelds presented in Section 3. In Section 5.1 we ﬁrst
compare the distance estimates obtained purely from Gaia
DR1 with the improved RAVE DR5 spectrophotometric dis-
tances. Then in Section 5.2 we compare the impact of using
proper motions from RAVE DR5, TGAS and UCAC5. In
Section 5.3 we introduce the velocity ﬁelds obtained using
the best estimates in distance and proper motion available
for our RAVE-TGAS sample.

5.1 Distance estimate

As discussed in Section 2.3, our RAVE-TGAS sample makes
use of two distance estimates: those of Astraatmadja &
Bailer-Jones (2016) and McMillan et al. (2017). We do this
on account of the problems discussed by Bailer-Jones (2015)
associated with use of inverse parallax as a distance estima-
tor.

If we assume measured parallaxes (cid:36) to be normally
distributed with a standard deviation σ(cid:36) , and adopt the
inverse parallax as the distance estimator, we encounter
two important issues: (i) the estimator fails for negative (cid:36),
even though these are valid measurements (see Bailer-Jones
2015 for further details). (ii) For fractional parallax errors
fObs = σ(cid:36) /(cid:36) > 0.2, using the inverse parallax creates a
skewed distribution which gives a biased distance estima-
tor. Figure 8 shows a cumulative histogram of fObs for our

Figure 9. Comparison of the distance estimates of McMillan,
which combine TGAS parallaxes with spectrophotometric data,
and those of ABJ using the Milky Way prior. The red line in-
dicates a perfect match between distances. Under 1 kpc about
∼ 66% of the distance estimates are in good agreement.

Beyond this limit, the latter performs better. Due to the
volume of our samples (d (cid:46) 2 kpc), we choose the distance
estimate obtained from the Milky Way prior for further anal-
ysis in this work.

Recently, McMillan et al. (2017) determined new dis-
tances to RAVE stars also using Bayesian inference, but
considering both TGAS parallaxes and stellar parameters
derived from the RAVE spectra, with Teﬀ values derived us-
ing the Infrared Flux Method (IRFM). Therefore, it is rec-
ommended to use this new estimate when combining RAVE
and TGAS data.

Figure 9 presents a comparison between the McMillan
distances and the ABJ distance estimates with the Milky
Way prior. The residuals between the two distance esti-
mates have a mean value of µ = 0.10 kpc and a dispersion of
σ = 0.36 kpc. Within ∼ 1 kpc the agreement is very good. A
comparison of the relative uncertainties σd/d between both
estimates is presented in Fig. 10. As can be seen, most stars
have smaller relative uncertainties when using the McMil-
lan estimate. Due to the consistency between the distance
estimates we want to further study the ABJ distance uncer-
tainties. Since the McMillan and the ABJ distance estimates
are not totally independent – both estimates use TGAS par-
allaxes to infer distances, we are not able to compare their
diﬀerences and learn about biases in one measurement versus
another or whether the error estimates are accurate. There-
fore, we compare ABJ to RAVE DR5 distances to further
study the ABJ distance uncertainties.

Here, as in Binney et al. (2014) and Kunder et al. (2017)
we divide the sample in three groups of stars: giants (log g <
3.5), hot dwarfs (log g > 3.5 and Teﬀ > 5500 K) and cool
dwarfs (log g > 3.5 and Teﬀ < 5500 K). The histograms of
Fig. 11 show the diﬀerences between the ABJ distance and
the RAVE DR5 distances as follows:

(red line) samples. The dotted curves represent the same sam-
ples taking into account systematic errors in the parallax un-

fObs < 0.2, using the inverse parallax as a distance estimate pro-
duces biased distances for at least ∼ 50% of the stars in both
samples.

RAVE-TGAS sample as well as the full TGAS sample. The
parallaxes of Gaia DR1 suﬀer from a possible oﬀset by ±0.1
mas of the parallax zero point and ±0.2 mas due to position
and colour-dependent systematics. A detailed description of
these systematics is given in Lindegren et al. (2016), ap-
pendix E. It is therefore recommended to add a systematic
error of ±0.3 mas to the parallax uncertainties (Gaia Col-
laboration et al. 2016b). The dotted curves show the same
TGAS data but consider the systematic errors. As can be
seen, the full TGAS and our RAVE-TGAS sample have a
relatively large number of stars (∼ 50%) within fObs < 0.2.
Nevertheless, using the inverse parallax in the RAVE-TGAS
sample would lead to potentially biased distance estimates
for a minimum of ∼ 50% of the stars. If we consider the sys-
tematic errors, we see that the distance estimate would be
biased for at least ∼ 60% of the stars.

The inverse parallax is therefore a poor distance esti-
mate for our RAVE-TGAS sample. If we select only the
stars with fObs < 0.2 including systematic errors, we would
limit the observed volume of stars within just 0.5 kpc around
the Sun. The volume obtained is then not big enough to rec-
ognize a distinctive mode in the Galaxy. Hence, another ap-
proach to estimate distances is required. Recently Astraat-
madja & Bailer-Jones (2016) used Bayesian inference to esti-
mate distances for the full TGAS sample. For this, they used
two diﬀerent priors: a exponentially decreasing space density
prior and an anisotropic prior based on a three-dimensional
density model of the Milky Way. The consistency of both pri-
ors was tested by comparing their distance estimates with
the determined distances of 105 Cepheid variable stars from
Groenewegen, M. A. T. (2013) cross-matched with Gaia
DR1 (see Figure 4 of Astraatmadja & Bailer-Jones (2016)).
It was shown that for distances d < 2 kpc, the Milky Way
prior comes closer to the more precise Cepheid distance esti-
mate than the exponentially decreasing space density prior.

Figure 10. Comparison between relative uncertainties σd /d in
the distance estimates of McMillan and ABJ. The red line denotes
equal σd /d values. For most stars the McMillan distances have
the smaller relative uncertainties.

Ideally, ∆ABJ−DR5 would have zero mean (no biases in one
measurement versus another) and unit dispersion (consistent
with the uncertainties being correctly estimated). The solid
red curves are Gaussians with the desired mean and disper-
sion. For hot and cool dwarfs the mean value of ∆ABJ−DR5
is positive and deviates from zero, which shows that the dis-
tance bias is a signiﬁcant fraction of the uncertainty, with the
ABJ distances being larger than the RAVE DR5 distances.
The negative ∆ABJ−DR5 = −0.23 for Giants indicate larger
distances in DR5. The characteristic feature in all three pan-
els is the dispersion σ < 1, this implies that the uncertainties
of one or both measurements are overestimated. However,
the agreement of distance estimates in Fig. 9 combined with
the diﬀerences between relative uncertainties in Fig. 10 sug-
gest that the ABJ distance uncertainties are overestimated.
This could be due to the possible overestimation of TGAS
uncertainties as discussed in McMillan et al. (2017).

5.2 TGAS proper motions

In RAVE the UCAC4 catalogue is the last proper-motion
catalogue that is independent of Gaia, and it contains the
largest number of stars in RAVE DR5. So we use the RAVE-
TGAS sample to compare UCAC4 proper motions with
TGAS and UCAC5 proper motions. Figure 12 displays the
cumulative distribution of the uncertainties in proper mo-
tion. The upper panel is for the right-ascension component,
σµα , while the lower panel is for the declination component,
σµδ . In UCAC4 and UCAC5 very few stars have uncertain-
ties smaller than 1 mas yr−1, whereas in TGAS more than
60% of stars have smaller uncertainties in declination and
only slightly fewer have smaller uncertainties in right as-
cension. On the other hand, less than 30% of stars have
UCAC5 uncertainties larger than 1 mas yr−1 in either com-
ponent while both TGAS and UCAC4 have longer tails of
stars with larger uncertainties in right ascension. Since our
sample has a mean/median σµ ∼ 1 mas yr−1, the TGAS
proper motions are more reliable in the selected volume. The

improvement in precision provided by TGAS proper motions
rather than UCAC5 is shown in Fig. 13. Both panels indi-
cate smaller relative proper-motion uncertainties in TGAS
than in UCAC5 in that the ridge-lines of the distributions
are steeper than the red lines for a perfect match between
catalogue values. The mean relative uncertainties in right
ascension for the most precisely observed 90% of the stars
are of order 6.0% in UCAC5 and 4.3% in TGAS for positive
proper motions and 6.6% in UCAC5 and 6.3% in TGAS for
negative proper motions.

Since even small proper motions diﬀerences can sig-
niﬁcantly aﬀect the space velocities obtained, the use of
TGAS/UCAC5 data over UCAC4 takes us one step closer
to solving the Milky Way mode discrepancy.

5.3 Gaia’s wobbly Galaxy

We now present the velocity ﬁelds constructed from the most
accurate estimates for our sample. When using the McMillan
distances, we exclude stars with an error of σd/d > 25% to
exclude uncertain velocities from our velocity ﬁelds. We join
these distances to line-of-sight velocities from RAVE and
TGAS proper motions to form the RAVE-TGAS-McMillan
data set with 58,972 stars. The top panels of Fig. 14 show
the median values of Vφ, VR and Vz as a function of galac-
tic position for the RAVE-TGAS-McMillan set. The bottom
panels show the corresponding velocity ﬁelds for the RAVE-
TGAS-ABJ set. Since the ABJ distance uncertainties appear
to be overestimated (Section 5.1), no distance cut has been
applied.

Both the Vφ velocity ﬁelds shown in the left pan-
els of Fig. 14 agree with those computed in Fig. 1 using
other data sets and proper motions. Within 500 pc, stars
both above and below the disc midplane exhibit velocities
Vφ ∼ 220 km s−1 which decrease with z. At z ∼ 1 kpc and
despite the smaller observed volume, the azimuthal velocity
in the bottom left panel reaches Vφ ∼ 170 km s−1, similar to
the values observed with Tycho -2 in Fig. 1.

In the middle panels of Fig. 14, both maps of median
VR diﬀer from the maps obtained with the other proper
motion catalogues (see Fig. 2). At 0.5 < z < 1 kpc a neg-
ative radial velocity gradient is evident above as well as
below the midplane. When the McMillan distance is used,
the peak gradient below the plane is ∂VR/∂R = −7.01 ±
0.61 km s−1 kpc−1, consistent with previous values, while
above the plane the peak gradient is ∂VR/∂R = −9.42 ±
1.77 km s−1 kpc−1. The ABJ distances yield similar values:
∂VR/∂R = −6.01 ± 0.62 km s−1 kpc−1 below the plane and
∂VR/∂R = −9.24 ± 2.28 km s−1 kpc−1 above it. Both maps
show similar radial-velocity structure, with a negative gra-
dient in both hemispheres inside R0 and a positive gradient
at R > R0. This radial structure could be related to the
simulations of Faure et al. (2014) and the analytical results
of Monari et al. (2016), who studied the response of stars
to a stable spiral perturbation. They found that the mean
value of VR is negative within the arms and positive in the
interarm region.

As a comparison to the radial gradient reported by
Siebert et al. (2011b), Fig. 15 shows the projection of line-of-
sight velocity in the direction of the Galactic centre (|l | < 5◦)
and anticentre (175◦ < l < 185◦) for the RAVE-TGAS-
McMillan sample, the RAVE DR5 full sample and the results

solid red curves are Gaussians of zero mean and unit dispersion, representing perfect results. To remove outliers, we use only values with
|∆ABJ−DR5 | < 4. The most characteristic feature in all three panels is the non-zero mean, indicating a clear diﬀerence between both
distance estimates and a dispersion less than unity, corresponding to overestimated uncertainties of one or both measurements.

obtained in their Figure 3. We compute the mean line-of-
sight velocity in bins of 0.2 kpc with a minimum of 50 stars
per bin. Each full curve represents the expected velocities of
a thin-disc model with the radial velocity gradients as indi-
cated. The dashed curve represents a thick-disc model with
zero gradient (see Siebert et al. 2011b for further details).
As can be seen both our samples are consistent within 1σ
with their results.

The right panels of Fig. 14 display maps of median ver-
tical velocities. Inside R0 we see a breathing mode with pos-
itive velocities above the plane and negative below; how-
ever outside R0, we see negative velocities above and below
the plane, corresponding to a bending mode. This combina-
tion of breathing and bending modes is inverted relative to
the combination discussed in Section 3 on the basis of the
UCAC4 proper motions, and it also diﬀers from the pattern
found by W13. The mode change we observe at R ≈ R0 could
be attributed to the Galactic warp as mentioned before, but
a deeper analysis is required to understand this eﬀect. By
comparing both right panels of Fig. 14 with the pattern ob-
tained by Williams/Kordopatis, it is clear that in both our
samples Vlos and Vb contribute equally, whereas the Vz pat-
tern obtained by Williams/Kordopatis is consistent with a
dominant Vb contribution (see Fig. 6).

As in Section 4, we now study the eﬀects of introduc-
ing errors to our sample and compare these to the results
obtained with Galaxia using the same data selection. Fig-
ure 16 shows this comparison. Although the RAVE-TGAS-
Mcmillan sample exhibits vertical structure and Galaxia
is axisymmetric, by adding a random error in distance of
σd/d = 0.8, we increase the dependence of Vz on Vb and
thus reproduce a velocity pattern similar to that found by
Williams/Kordopatis. This experiment suggests that the dif-
ferent relative importance between the Vlos and Vb patterns
in the RAVE-TGAS-McMillan sample and the ones obtained
by Williams/Kordopatis could arise from better distance es-
timates for our sample.

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2017)

To study further the combination of breathing and
bending modes, we now divide our subsamples in diﬀerent
radial bins from R = 6 kpc to R = 9 kpc in 0.5 kpc intervals
and compute the median Vz as a function of z in bins of
0.3 kpc. Each bin contains a minimum of 50 stars.

From left to right Fig. 17 shows the results obtained
with (i) axisymmetric Galaxia model including random er-
= 1 mas yr−1, (ii) UCAC4 proper
rors of σd/d = 0.8 and σµb
motions and RAVE DR5 distances, (iii) UCAC5 proper mo-
tions and McMillan distances cut to σd/d < 25%, (iv) the
RAVE-TGAS-McMillan sample cut to σd/d < 25%, and (v)
the RAVE-TGAS-ABJ sample.

The leftmost column shows the pattern obtained from
the mock RAVE sample including random errors in dis-
= 1 mas yr−1
tance of σd/d = 0.8 and proper motion of σµb
to match the errors in the RAVE-TGAS-McMillan sample.
The obtained pattern in the Galaxia model shows ampli-
tudes that are similar to the data, however, the signature
of the pattern does not match any of the structures in our
samples. Therefore, the patterns observed with the RAVE-
TGAS subsamples may in fact be due to non-axisymmetries
in the Milky Way disc.

In all RAVE-TGAS subsamples (3rd, 4th and 5th col-
umn), the top panels, with distances 6 < R < 7.5 kpc,
show positive vertical velocities in the northern Galactic
hemisphere and negative in the southern hemisphere. Thus,
the stellar motions agree closely with those expected for a
breathing mode. This is consistent with the velocity trend
observed in Figure 4 of Widrow et al. (2012). However, the
bottom panels covering the distance range 7.5 < R < 9 kpc
are mainly dominated by negative values of Vz above and
below the plane, corresponding to a bending mode. This
signal is clear in the last column, based on ABJ distances,
but weak in the other two columns. From top to bottom we
see a gradual change from a breathing to a bending mode.
In the 2nd column of Fig. 17 we see with weak signiﬁ-
cance the opposite behaviour: a gradual change from a bend-

distances 7 < R < 9 kpc. Given the weakness of this signal
and the inferior quality of both the distances and the proper
motions on which the leftmost column is based, we discount
this combination of breathing and bending modes.

In contrast to previous results suggesting a breathing
mode perturbation in the extended solar neighbourhood, our
analysis supports a combination of breathing mode inside R0
and bending mode outside R0. Inwards of the solar radius,
a bar and/or spiral perturbations could have induced the
breathing mode; alternatively, this could be due to a satel-
lite perturbation. The expected vertical variations due to
the spiral structure are of the order of ≈ 4 km s−1 (Faure
et al. 2014) and just a small contribution due to the bar
0.5 km s−1 (Monari et al. 2015), thus the vertical amplitude

we observe of ≈ 10 km s−1 suggests that the vertical structure
at R < R0 may not have a purely internal origin but arise
from the combination of internal and external mechanisms.
On the other hand, the bending mode outside the solar ra-
dius is consistent with an external perturbation, for example
caused by the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy or a dark matter sub-
halo passing through the disc. G´omez et al. (2013) studied
a high-resolution simulation of the interaction between the
Milky Way and Sgr and showed that the amplitude of the
induced mean vertical velocity is ∼ 8 km s−1. Using a simi-
lar simulated setup, D’Onghia et al. (2016) reported vertical
streaming motions of 10−20 km s−1. Both of these are consis-
tent with our ﬁndings. The structure we ﬁnd is likely related
to the Galactic warp extending outside the solar radius.

The possible combination of breathing and bending
mode could thus be seen as a superposition of waves exist-
ing simultaneously in the Milky Way disc. However, further
modelling is needed to understand the individual eﬀects that

6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have used RAVE data combined with the Tycho-Gaia as-
trometric solution catalogue (TGAS) to study the evolution
of median velocities with Galactic radius and position rela-
tive to the plane. We studied two main samples: (i) a sample
obtained from RAVE DR5 cross-matched with the Tycho -2,
PPMXL and UCAC4 catalogues (RAVE DR5 sample); (ii)
samples comprising stars in RAVE DR5 that have TGAS as-
trometry using distances either inferred from TGAS trigono-
metric parallaxes by Astraatmadja & Bailer-Jones (2016) or
distances obtained by McMillan et al. (2017) by combining
TGAS parallaxes with spectrophotometric data. In agree-
ment with recent studies, we identiﬁed asymmetries in VR
and Vz and less pronounced asymmetries in Vφ. Indepen-

At distances |z| < 1 kpc, we conﬁrmed the gradient in
Galactocentric radial velocity VR previously observed. In
our RAVE DR5 sample, using PPMXL proper motions, we
found the largest gradient in the southern Galactic hemi-
sphere to be ∂VR/∂R = −5.99 ± 0.81 km s−1 kpc−1, consis-
tent with the gradient reported by Siebert et al. (2011b).
In the northern hemisphere at R < R0, we identiﬁed sim-
ilar gradients, with the largest value being ∂VR/∂R =
−8.53 ± 1.82 km s−1 kpc−1 obtained with the Tycho -2 proper
motions. Using our more accurate RAVE-TGAS-McMillan
sample, we measured ∂VR/∂R = −7.01 ± 0.61 km s−1 kpc−1
in the southern Galactic hemisphere and ∂VR/∂R = −9.42 ±
1.77 km s−1 kpc−1 in the northern hemisphere. As seen in
Fig. 14, middle panels, the gradient seems to reverse sign at
R > R0, consistent with the expected eﬀect of spiral struc-
ture (Faure et al. 2014; Monari et al. 2016; this, however,
does not mean that the bar plays no role in shaping the gra-

dient). In both the RAVE DR5 and RAVE-TGAS samples,
we used the projection of the line-of-sight velocity on the
Galactic plane in the direction of the Galactic centre and
anticentre to compare our results with the radial gradient
previously obtained. Our samples proved to be consistent
within 1σ. While our sample and those of many previous
works is a mixture of stars with diﬀerent ages and chemistry,
the radial gradient can vary strongly for stellar populations
with narrow ranges in ages and/or metallicity (Wojno et al.
Submitted).

The Vz velocity ﬁelds display a more complex structure,
the origin of which is under debate. Spiral arms (Faure et al.
2014; Monari et al. 2016), and to a lesser extent the bar
(Monari et al. 2015), naturally induce a pattern with odd
parity in the Vz distribution of stars with respect to z, asso-
ciated with a breathing mode. In contrast, bending modes
(even parity in the Vz distribution) are attributed mainly to
external perturbations such a satellite galaxy or dark matter
subhalo crossing the Galactic plane. Widrow et al. (2014),
however, showed that a passing satellite galaxy could pro-
duce both bending and breathing modes depending on the
vertical velocity of the satellite.

We have shown that maps of Vz depend strongly on the
adopted proper motions and distances. Williams et al. (2013)
and Kordopatis et al. (2013b) employed a compilation of
proper motions and found that inside the solar radius, there
was upward motion above the plane and downward motion
below it. Outside the solar radius this velocity pattern re-

versed. This pattern is consistent with that of a breathing
mode.

Using our RAVE DR5 sample, with more accurate
proper motions from the UCAC4 catalogue, we conﬁrmed
the observed breathing mode outside the solar radius. How-
ever, inside R0, we found upward motion both above and
below the plane, consistent with a bending mode. Thus us-
ing the UCAC4 proper motions with RAVE DR5 changes
the breathing mode observed by Williams/Kordopatis to a
possible combination of bending and breathing modes (com-
pare right column panels of Fig. 4).

Our most accurate velocity ﬁeld, obtained with TGAS
proper motions and McMillan distances, which exploits both
TGAS parallaxes and the Infrared Flux Method, supports a
combination of bending and breathing modes.

After studying the components of the vertical veloc-
ity, we found the Williams/Kordopatis breathing mode to
be due to the contribution of the transverse velocity com-
ponent dominating that of line-of-sight velocities (Fig. 6).
The structure resulting from the transverse velocity alone
depends mainly on the proper motion, while the distance
increases its amplitude. By adding artiﬁcial distance errors
to our RAVE-TGAS sample and to an axisymmetric mock
RAVE-like sample from Galaxia, we were able to increase
the transverse velocity in both samples and artiﬁcially re-
produce the breathing mode observed by W13 (see Fig. 16).
The combination of modes found in the RAVE-TGAS
sample is the inverse of that found with UCAC4 proper mo-
tions. Inside R0 we identiﬁed patterns that appear consis-
tent with a breathing mode and outside R0 they seem to
agree with a bending mode. Similar structure is found with
UCAC5 proper motions (see Fig. 17). This combination of
breathing and bending modes could be seen as a superposi-
tion of waves existing simultaneously in the Milky Way disc.
Unlike the pattern found with UCAC4, the TGAS/UCAC5
pattern makes physical sense, inwards of the solar radius, a
bar and/or spiral perturbations could induce the observed
breathing mode, while outside, bending modes would likely
be generated by external perturbations such as a passing
satellite galaxy or a dark matter subhalo. Further modelling
is needed to understand what combination of perturbations
to the Milky Way disc can induce a bending/breathing mode
outside/inside the solar circle.

To conﬁrm our results that the Milky Way exhibits both
bending and breathing modes, a larger disc volume must be
probed. Compared to Gaia DR1, Gaia DR2 will cover a
signiﬁcantly larger volume of the Milky Way disc and im-
prove signiﬁcantly the data systematics. For stars within the
RAVE magnitude, Gaia DR2 will have a preliminary paral-
lax error of σ(cid:36) = 0.03 mas (Katz & Brown 2017) and proper
motion uncertainties of σµ ≈ 0.04 mas yr−1 (Marchetti et al.
2017). This will improve the median σVz and σVr by a fac-
tor of 6. Thus, using data from Gaia DR2, may solve the
question whether the Milky Way is still just breathing.

UCAC5 with McMillan distances cut on σd /d < 25% (3rd column), TGAS with McMillan distances cut on σd /d < 25% (4th column);

error bars correspond to the standard error of the median. The upper panels in the three right columns (which all beneﬁt from TGAS
proper motions) exhibit far from the plane positive velocities in the northern hemisphere and negative in the southern hemisphere, the
signature of a breathing mode. The lower panels in these columns show the signature of a bending mode, even parity in the vertical
velocity distribution. By contrast, the lower panels for UCAC4 show the signature of a breathing mode.
