Abstract

1 Introduction

The distribution of young open clusters in the Galac-
tic plane within 3 kpc from the Sun suggests the exis-
tence of the outer ring R1R′
2 in the Galaxy. The op-
timum value of the solar position angle with respect
to the major axis of the bar, θb, providing the best
agreement between the distribution of open clusters
and model particles is θb = 35 ± 10◦. The kinemati-
cal features obtained for young open clusters and OB-
associations with negative Galactocentric radial veloc-
ity VR indicate the solar location near the descending
segment of the outer ring R2.

Open clusters are compact groups of stars born inside
one giant molecular cloud during a short time interval.
Young open clusters are gravitationally bound objects
in distinction from OB-associations, which are loose
groups of O and B-type stars. Such diﬀerences be-
tween young clusters and OB-associations are based on
the comparison of their mass with the velocity disper-
sions inside them. The fact that all stars inside an open
cluster have nearly the same age gives researchers the
opportunity to ﬁt the cluster main sequence and colour-
colour diagrams to model grids derived from zero age
main sequence (ZAMS) and a set of isochrones corre-
sponding to diﬀerent abundances. The result of ﬁtting
is the determination of many important physical char-
acteristics of clusters, such as heliocentric distance, age,
and metallicity (Kholopov 1980; Mermilliod 1981).

Young open clusters indicate the positions of giant
molecular clouds but unlike gaseous objects, open clus-
ters allow their distances to be determined quite pre-
cisely with an accuracy of ∼ 5% as far as we ignore
possible errors in the zero point of the adopted ZAMS
(Dambis 1999). So the concentration of young open
clusters in some complexes suggests the presence of gas
there and traces the positions of spiral arms and Galac-
tic rings.

We suppose that the Galaxy contains a two-com-
ponent outer ring R1R′
2 made up of two elliptical
gaseous rings stretched perpendicularly to each other
and located near the solar circle (Fig. 1). The sign of
apostrophe means the pseudoring R′
2 – incomplete ring
made up of two tightly wound spiral arms. The idea
that the Galaxy contains outer rings was ﬁrst put for-
ward by Kalnajs (1991).

Two main classes of outer rings and pseudorings have
been identiﬁed: rings R1 (pseudorings R′
1) elongated
perpendicular to the bar and rings R2 (pseudorings

in-between the two outer rings, where they seem to fuse together. As for the Cygnus complex, its connection with some
global structure is unclear. Roman numerals show the numbers of quadrants.

is a combined morphological type R1R′
2 which exhibits
elements of both classes (Buta 1995; Buta & Combes
1996; Buta & Crocker 1991). Modelling shows that
outer rings are usually located near the Outer Lindblad
resonance (OLR) of the bar (Schwarz 1981; Byrd et al.
1994; Rautiainen & Salo 1999, 2000, and other papers).
Comeron et al. (2014) used the data from mid-
infrared survey (Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in
Galaxies, Sheth et al. 2010) to ﬁnd that the frequency
of outer rings is 16% for all spiral galaxies located in-
side 20 Mpc and over 40% for disk galaxies of early
morphological types (galaxies with large bulges). The
above authors have also found that the frequency of
outer rings increases from 15 ± 2% to 32 ± 7% when
going through the family sequence from SA to SAB,
and decreases again to 20 ± 2% for SB galaxies.

Note that the catalogue by Buta (1995) includes
several tens of galaxies with rings R1R′
2. Here are
some examples of galaxies with the R1R′
2 morphol-
ogy that can be viewed as possible prototypes of
the Milky Way: ESO 245-1, NGC 1079, NGC 1211,
NGC 3081, NGC 5101, NGC 5701, NGC 6782, and
NGC 7098. Their images can be found in de Vau-
couleurs Atlas of Galaxies by Buta et al. (2007) at
http://bama.ua.edu/∼rbuta/devatlas/

There is extensive evidence for the existence of the
bar in the Galaxy derived on the basis of infra-red ob-
servations (Blitz & Spergel 1991; Benjamin et al. 2005;
Cabrera-Lavers et al. 2007; Gonz´alez-Fern´andez et al.
2012; Churchwell et al. 2009) and gas kinematics in the
central region (Binney et al. 1991; Englmaier & Gerhard
1999; Weiner & Sellwood 1999). The general consensus
is that the major axis of the bar is oriented in the di-
rection θb = 15–45◦ in such a way that the end of the
bar closest to the Sun lies in quadrant I, where θb is
the position angle between the line connecting the Sun
and the Galactic center and the direction of the major
axis of the bar. The semi-major axis of the Galactic
bar is supposed to lie in the range a = 3.5–5.0 kpc.
Assuming that its end is located close to its corota-
tion radius (CR), i.e. we are dealing with a so-called
fast bar (Debattista & Sellwood 2000), and that the
rotation curve is ﬂat, we can estimate the bar angu-
lar speed Ωb, which appears to be constrained to the
interval Ωb = 40–65 km s−1 kpc−1. This means that
the OLR of the bar is located in the solar vicinity:
|ROLR −R0| < 1.5 kpc. Studies of the kinematics of old
disk stars in the nearest solar neighbourhood, r < 250
pc, reveal the bimodal structure of the distribution of
(u, v) velocities, which is also interpreted to be a result
of the solar location near the OLR of the bar (Dehnen
2000; Fux 2001, and other papers).

The explanation of the kinematics of young ob-
jects in the Perseus stellar-gas complex (see its lo-
cation in Fig. 2b) is a serious test for diﬀerent con-
cepts of the Galactic spiral structure. The fact that
the velocities of young stars in the Perseus stellar-
gas complex are directed toward the Galactic center,
if interpreted in terms of the density-wave concept
(Lin et al. 1969), indicates that the trailing fragment
of the Perseus arm must be located inside the corota-
tion circle (CR) (Burton & Bania 1974; Mel’nik et al.
2001; Mel’nik 2003; Sitnik 2003), and hence imposes
an upper limit for its pattern speed Ωsp < 25 km s−1
kpc−1, which is inconsistent with the pattern speed of
the bar Ωb = 40–65 km s−1 kpc−1 mentioned above.

The studies of Galactic spiral structure are usually

based on the classical model developed by Georgelin & Georgelin
(1976), which includes four spiral arms with a pitch an-
gle of ∼ 12◦ (see e.g.
the review by Vall´ee 2013).
The main achievement of this purely spiral model is
that it can explain the distribution of HII regions in
the Galactic disk (Russeil 2003). This model became
more physical after incorporation of the bar into it
(Englmaier & Gerhard 1999). However, the bar and
spiral arms connected with it rotate with the angular
speed Ωb = 50–60 km s−1 kpc−1, and this model can-
not explain the kinematics of young stars in the Perseus
complex. Bissantz et al. (2003) developed the model of
Englmaier & Gerhard (1999) by adding a pair of spiral
arms rotating slower than the bar with Ωsp = 20 km s−1
kpc−1. However, it remains unclear what mechanism
can sustain this slower spiral pattern in the disk.

Liszt (1985) criticizes the use of kinematical dis-
tances for tracing the Galactic spiral structure. He
shows that kinematical distances derived for HII re-
gions, HI and CO clouds can be wrong due to kinematic-
distance ambiguity and velocity perturbation from spi-
ral arms. Moreover, Adler & Roberts (1992) show that
bright spots in the diagrams (l, VLSR) which are in-
terpreted as ”clouds” can consist of a chain of clouds
extending over several kpc along the line of sight.

Models of the Galaxy with the outer ring R1R′
2
reproduce well the radial and azimuthal components
of the residual velocities (observed velocities minus
the velocity due to the rotation curve and solar mo-
tion to the apex) of OB-associations in the Sagittar-
ius (see its location in Fig. 2b) and Perseus com-
plexes. The radial velocities of most OB-associations
in the Perseus stellar-gas complex are directed toward
the Galactic center and this indicates the presence
of the ring R2 in the Galaxy, while the radial ve-
locities in the Sagittarius complex are directed away
from the Galactic center suggesting the existence of
the ring R1. The nearly zero azimuthal component

5

of the residual velocity of most OB-associations in the
Sagittarius complex precisely constrains the solar po-
sition angle with respect to the bar major axis, θb =
45 ± 5◦. We considered models with analytical bars
and N-body simulations (Mel’nik & Rautiainen 2009;
Rautiainen & Mel’nik 2010).

The classical model of Galactic spiral structure
can explain the existence of so-called tangential di-
rections related to the maxima in the thermal radio
continuum as well as HI and CO emission, which
are associated with the tangents to the spiral arms
(Englmaier & Gerhard 1999; Vall´ee 2008). Models of
a two-component outer ring can also explain the ex-
istence of some of the tangential directions which, in
this case, can be associated with the tangents to the
outer and inner rings. Our model diagrams (l ,VLSR)
reproduce the maxima in the direction of the Carina,
Crux (Centaurus), Norma, and Sagittarius arms. Addi-
tionally, N-body model yields maxima in the directions
of the Scutum and 3-kpc arms (Mel’nik & Rautiainen
2011, 2013).

Pettitt at al. (2014) simulated the (l,VLSR) diagrams
for models with analytical bar. Their gas disks form
the two-component outer rings R1R2 200–500 Myr after
the start of the simulation. The above authors found
observations to agree best with the model with the solar
position angle of θb ≈ 45◦ and the bar pattern speed in
the range of Ωb = 50–60 km s−1 kpc−1.

Elliptic outer rings can be divided into the ascend-
ing and descending segments:
in the ascending seg-
ments galactocentric distance R decreases with increas-
ing azimuthal angle θ, which itself increases in the di-
rection of galactic rotation, whereas in the descending
segments distance R, on the contrary, increases with in-
creasing angle θ. Ascending and descending segments
of the rings can be regarded as fragments of trailing
and leading spiral arms, respectively. Note that if con-
sidered as fragments of the spiral arms, the ascending
segments of the outer ring R2 have the pitch angle of
∼ 6◦ (Mel’nik & Rautiainen 2011).

corotation, while most orbits in the bar are ordered
(Contopoulos & Patsis 2006; Voglis et al. 2007). Not
only periodic orbits induced by the bar and regular
orbits related to them, but also manifolds connected
to the unstable Lagrangian points near the ends of
the bar, may contribute to the formation of outer
rings and pseudorings (Romero-G´omez et al. 2007;
Harsoula & Kalapotharakos 2009; Athanassoula et al.
2010).

The study of classical Cepheids from the catalogue
by Berdnikov et al. (2000) revealed the existence of
”the tuning-fork-like” structure in the distribution of
Cepheids: at longitudes l > 180◦ (quadrants III and
IV) Cepheids concentrate strongly to the arm located
near the Carina complex (the Carina arm), while at
longitudes l < 180◦ (quadrants I and II) there are two
regions of high surface density located near the Perseus
and Sagittarius complexes. The term ”the Carina arm”
was used to designate the part of the Sagittarius-Carina
arm (Fig.
11 in Georgelin & Georgelin 1976) that
starts near the Carina complex and continues to larger
Galactocentric distances. In a morphological study the
Carina arm cannot be distinguished from the ascend-
ing segment of the ring R2. This morphology suggests
that outer rings R1 and R2 come closest to each other
somewhere near the Carina complex (see its location in
Fig. 2b). We have also found some kinematical features
in the distribution of Cepheids, which suggest the loca-
tion of the Sun near the descending segment of the ring
R2 (Mel’nik et al. 2015).

In this paper we study the distribution and kinemat-
ics of young open clusters and OB-associations. Section
2 describes the models and catalogues used; Section 3
considers the morphological and kinematical features
that suggest the existence of R1R′
2 ring in the Galaxy,
and Section 4 presents the main conclusions.

2 Catalogues and Models

Schwarz (1981) associates two main types of outer
rings with two main families of periodic orbits existing
near the OLR of the bar (Contopoulos & Papayannopoulos
1980). The main periodic orbits are followed by nu-
merous chaotic orbits, and this guidance enables el-
liptical rings to hold a lot of gas in their vicinity.
The rings R1 are supported by x1(2)-orbits (using
the nomenclature of Contopoulos & Grosbol 1989) ly-
ing inside the OLR and elongated perpendicular to
the bar, while the rings R2 are supported by x1(1)-
orbits located slightly outside the OLR and elongated
along the bar. However, the role of chaotic and pe-
riodic orbits appears to be diﬀerent inside and out-
side the CR of the bar: chaos is dominant outside

There are several large catalogues of open clusters.
Dias et al. (2002) compiled a catalogue of the phys-
ical and kinematic parameters of open clusters us-
ing data reported by diﬀerent authors. This cat-
is available
alogue, which is updated continuously,
at http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/ocdb/ and presently
lists 2167 clusters. Kharchenko et al. (2013) deter-
mined physical,
structural and kinematic parame-
ters of 3006 Galactic clusters. Mermilliod (1992)
created WEBDA database of stars in open clusters
(https://www.univie.ac.at/webda/), where positional,
photometric and spectroscopic data for individual stars
in cluster ﬁelds is stored. Mermilliod & Paunzen (2003)

6

analysed these data and derived the astrophysical pa-
rameters (reddening, distance and age) of 573 open
clusters.

In the last decade many embedded clusters (stel-
lar groups recently born and still containing a lot of
gas within their volumes) were detected from near-
and mid-infrared surveys (see e. g.
the reviews by
Glushkova 2013; Morales et al. 2013). However, dis-
tances to most of these objects reman uncertain mainly
because of the variable extinction law in the ﬁeld of em-
bedded clusters. The determination of their colour ex-
cesses requires detailed photometric and spectroscopic
studies. For example, the estimates of the distance to
the embedded cluster Westerlund 2 ranged from r = 2
to 8 kpc, before a detailed study of this region has been
carried out (Carraro et al. 2013). In this paper we con-
sider only optically observed clusters.

For our study we have chosen the catalogue by
Dias et al. (2002), which provides the most reliable es-
timates of distances, ages and other parameters.
Its
new version (3.4) contains 627 young clusters with the
ages less than 100 Myr.

Paunzen & Netopil (2006) established a list of 72
”standard” open clusters covering a wide range of ages,
reddenings and distances selected on the basis of small-
est errors from the available parameters in the liter-
ature. Their analysis is based on the averaged val-
ues from widely diﬀerent methods and authors. The
authors then compared the derived mean values with
the parameters of open clusters published by Dias et al.
(2002). They found that if one uses the parameters of
the catalogue by Dias et al. (2002) then the expected
errors are comparable with those derived by averag-
ing the independent values from the literature. They
concluded that ages, reddenings and distances in the
catalog by Dias et al. (2002) are good for statistical re-
search.

We adopted the proper motions of open clus-
ters based on the Hipparcos catalogue (Hipparcos
1997) from the paper by Baumgardt et al. (2000),
from the catalogues
and if they were absent there,
by Glushkova et al. (1996, 1997), which are available
at https://www.univie.ac.at/webda/elena.html. In the
latter lists the proper motions were derived from the
Four-Million Star Catalogue of positions and proper
motions (4M-catalogue, Volchkov et al. 1992) and then
reduced to the Hipparcos system. We chose these cata-
logues of proper motions because of the careful selection
of star cluster members.

For kinematical study, we also use OB-associations
from the list by Blaha & Humphreys (1989), which in-
cludes 91 objects. Their heliocentric distances rBH
were reduced to the short distance scale r = 0.8 ·

rBH (Sitnik & Mel’nik 1996). The kinematical data
were adopted from the catalogue by Mel’nik & Dambis
(2009). The ages of OB-associations are supposed
to be less than 30 Myr (Humphreys & McElroy 1984;
Bressan et al. 2012).

We use the simulation code developed by H. Salo
(Salo 1991; Salo & Laurikainen 2000) to construct two
diﬀerent types of models (models with analytical bars
and models based on N-body simulations), which repro-
duce the kinematics of OB-associations in the Perseus
and Sagittarius complexes. Among many models with
outer rings, we chose model 3 from the series of mod-
els with analytical bars (Mel’nik & Rautiainen 2009)
to compare with observations. This model has nearly
ﬂat rotation curve. The bar semi-axes are equal to
a = 4.0 kpc and b = 1.3 kpc. The positions and ve-
locities of 5 · 104 model particles (gas+OB) are consid-
ered at time T ≈ 1 Gyr from the start of the sim-
ulation. We scaled and turned this model with re-
spect to the Sun to achieve the best agreement be-
tween the velocities of model particles and those of OB-
associations in ﬁve stellar-gas complexes identiﬁed by
Efremov & Sitnik (1988).

We adopt a solar Galactocentric distance of R0 =
7.5 kpc (Rastorguev et al. 1994; Dambis et al. 1995;
Glushkova et al. 1998; Nikiforov 2004; Feast et al. 2008;
Groenewegen et al. 2008; Reid at al. 2009b; Dambis et al.
2013; Francis & Anderson 2014). As model 3 was ad-
justed for R0 = 7.1 kpc, we rescaled all distances for
model particles by a factor of k = 7.5/7.1. Note that
the particular choice of R0 in the range 7-9 kpc has
practically no eﬀect on the analysis of the morphology
and kinematics of stars located within 3 kpc from the
Sun.

3 Results

3.1 Space distribution of young open clusters

The distribution of young open clusters in the Galactic
plane can reveal regions of intense star formation, which
can be associated with spiral arms or Galactic rings.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of young open clusters
from the catalog by Dias et al. (2002) and model par-
ticles in the Galactic plane. Only clusters with ages
less than 100 Myr and located within 0.5 kpc (|z| < 0.5
kpc) from the Galactic plane are considered. We can
see the model location of the outer rings R1 and R2
calculated for the solar position angle with respect to
the bar major axis of θb = 45◦.

Figure 2a shows the distribution of young open clus-
ters from the catalog by Dias et al. (2002) and model

7

particles in a larger scale. To avoid cluttering with
other objects, we made another plot (Fig. 2b), where we
indicate the positions of rich OB-associations as well.
The catalog by Blaha & Humphreys (1989) includes 27
rich OB-associations containing more than 30 members
(Nt > 30). Figure 2b also presents the positions of
the Sagittarius, Scorpio, Carina, Cygnus, Local Sys-
tem and Perseus stellar-gas complexes from the list by
Efremov & Sitnik (1988). We can see a tuning-fork-
like structure in the distribution of young open clus-
ters and OB-associations. At negative x-coordinates
(on the left-hand side) most of the clusters concentrate
to the only one arm (the Carina arm), while at posi-
tive x-coordinates (on the right-hand side) most of the
clusters lie near the Perseus or the Sagittarius com-
plexes. The Carina stellar-gas complex is located in-
between the two outer rings, where they come closest
to each other. The Sagittarius and Scorpio complexes
lie near the ring R1, while the Perseus complex and
Local System, on the contrary, are situated near the
ring R2. In quadrant III, young objects within r < 1.5
kpc concentrate to the Sun, while more distant objects
distribute nearly randomly over a large area. As for
the Cygnus complex, its connection with some global
structure (outer ring or spiral arm) is unclear. How-
ever, the kinematics of young objects in the Cygnus
complex is similar to that in the Perseus stellar-gas
complex (Sitnik & Mel’nik 1996, 1999), and we there-
fore tend to consider the Cygnus complex as a spur of
the ring R2, which can be rather lumpy.

Using the model distribution, we can quite accu-
rately approximate the position of two outer rings by
two ellipses oriented perpendicular to each other. The
outer ring R1 can be represented by the ellipse with
the semi-axes a1 = 6.3 and b1 = 5.8 kpc, while the
outer ring R2 ﬁts well the ellipse with a2 = 8.5 and
b2 = 7.6 kpc. These values correspond to the solar
Galactocentric distance R0 = 7.5 kpc. The ring R1 is
stretched perpendicular to the bar and the ring R2 is
aligned with the bar, hence the position of the sample
of open clusters with respect to the rings is determined
by the position angle θb of the Sun with respect to the
major axis of the bar. The outer rings do not touch
each other because gas particles located on the orbits
which cross near the OLR were scattered due to colli-
sions during the formation of the outer rings. We now
try to ﬁnd the optimum angle θb providing the best
agreement between the positions of the open clusters
and the orientation of the outer rings.

Figure 3 shows the χ2 functions – the sums of nor-
malized squared deviations (Press et al. 1987) of open
clusters from the outer rings – calculated for diﬀerent
values of the angle θb. Figure 3a shows the χ2 curve de-
rived for the distribution of 564 young clusters located

within r < 3.5 kpc of the Sun. We can see a minimum
at θmin = 35◦ here. The random error of this estimate
is of about ±3◦. Table 1 lists the parameters of the
observed sample: the number N of clusters, the stan-
dard deviation σ of a cluster from the model position
of the outer rings, and the angle θmin corresponding to
the minimum on the χ2 curve.

Figure 3b shows the χ2 functions computed for 10
random samples also containing 564 objects and dis-
tributed along the heliocentric distance r in accordance
with a power law n(r) = r−1 that simulates the ef-
fect of selection (see section 3.2). An example of a
such a random sample is shown in Figure 4a. The χ2
functions calculated for random samples demonstrate a
plateau in the 0 < θb ≤ 30◦ range and a steep rise in
the 30 < θb < 90◦ interval (Fig. 3b). A comparison
of images shown in Figure 3a and Figure 3b indicates
that the minimum at θmin = 35◦ exists only on the
curve obtained for the observed objects suggesting that
it is not due to some speciﬁc best-ﬁtting angles which
are, in principle, possible in the cases involving only a
small region of the Galactic plane.

We made some modiﬁcations to the observed sam-
ple to show how the overdensities in the Perseus and
Carina complexes inﬂuence the shape of the χ2 func-
tion. Figure 5 shows the χ2 curves computed for the
observed sample of open clusters after the mirror re-
ﬂection of some regions with respect to the axis Y . All
χ2 functions were calculated for the same number of
objects Nobs = 564. Sample designated as ”S1” was
obtained from the observed distribution by changing
(l → 360◦ − l) for objects located in quadrants II and
III. In sample ”S1” the overdensity associated with the
Perseus complex is located in quadrant III and the min-
imum of the corresponding χ2 curve becomes shallower
in comparison with that obtained for the observed sam-
ple. This ﬂattening of the χ2 curve is caused by the fact
that the ring R2 reaches larger y-coordinates in quad-
rant II than in quadrant III (Fig. 2). It is true for all
values of θb from the expected interval 15–45◦. Hence
moving the Perseus complex into quadrant III increases
deviations from the rings, and, consequently, increases
the corresponding values of χ2.

Sample ”S2” (Fig. 5) is obtained by changing (l →
360◦−l) for objects of quadrants IV and I, while objects
of quadrants I and II are left at their original places. In

containing 564 objects and distributed in the Galactic plane in accordance with the power law n(r) ∼ r−1 that simulates
the eﬀect of selection. We show one such sample in Fig. 4a. The χ2 curves calculated for random samples demonstrate a
plateau at the 0 < θb ≤ 30◦ interval followed by a steep rise in the 30 < θb < 90◦ interval. The dissimilarity of the curves
shown in ”a” and ”b” panels leads us to conclude that the minimum of the curve in panel ”a” is not due to some model
eﬀects.

sample ”S2” the overdensity associated with the Carina
complex is located in quadrant I just between the rings
R1 and R2. This transformation increases the devia-
tions from the rings for objects of the Carina complex
and causes the ﬂattening the χ2 curve as well.

Sample ”S3” is a result of the (l → 360◦ −l) transfor-
mation of coordinates of all objects (Fig. 5). Here the
overdensities associated with the Perseus and Carina
complexes lie in quadrants III and I, respectively. We
can see that the corresponding χ2 curve is practically
ﬂat in the interval θb = 15–45◦. The disappearance of
the minimum here is due to the tuning-fork-like struc-
ture in the distribution of the observed objects. The
mirror reﬂection creates the tuning-fork-like structure
pointed in the opposite direction (one segment lies at
positive x-coordinates and two segments are located at
negative x-coordinates), which is inconsistent with the
position of the outer rings obtained for θb = 15–45◦.

Figure 6 shows the histogram of the deviations (mini-
mal distances) d of young open clusters from the model
positions of the outer rings calculated for θb = 35◦.
Here we can clearly see the concentration of observed
clusters to the model positions of the outer rings. Devi-
ations d from the rings in the direction of the increasing
y-coordinates are considered positive and those in the
opposite direction are considered negative. The distri-
bution of deviations can be approximated by the Gaus-
sian law with a standard deviation of σ = 0.8 kpc. The
excess of positive deviations at d > 1.5 kpc is due to
clusters located in the direction of the anticenter. The
fraction of clusters located in the vicinity of 1.5 kpc
(∼ 2σ) from the rings appears to be 95%, which is in
good agreement with the Gaussian law.

We studied the eﬀect of objects located in diﬀerent
regions on the location of the minimum of the χ2 curve.
Removing the clusters located within the 0.5-kpc region
(r < 0.5 kpc) decreases θmin from 35 to 30◦. This shift
appears due to the fact that the outer ring R2 passes
through the solar vicinity at angle θb = 90◦. So nearby
clusters ”favour” greater θb values. However, there is
also an opposite eﬀect: excluding distant clusters lo-
cated in the direction of the anticenter (y > 2.5 kpc)
from the observed sample increases θmin from 35 to 40◦.
These clusters (y > 2.5 kpc) are located far from both
outer rings and therefore ”favour” the θb = 0◦ value
in the case of which the ring R2 crosses the Y -axis at
maximum Galactocentric distance. We hence tend re-
gard the uncertainty of ±5◦ as a random error of our
method.

We made an attempt to simulate the inﬂuence of se-
lection eﬀects by assigning to every model object the
probability P of its detection. Generally, the detection
of a cluster depends on a lot of things: the richness

young open clusters from the catalog by Dias et al. (2002)
(”Obs”) has the deepest minimum. The modiﬁed sample
”S1” is obtained from the observed one by the mirror reﬂec-
tion of objects located in quadrants II and III with respect
◦
to the axis Y , which is identical with the (l → 360

transformation. In sample ”S1” the overdensity associated
with the Perseus stellar-gas complex is located in quadrant
◦
III. Sample ”S2” is obtained by changing (l → 360
− l) for
objects located in quadrants IV and I, while objects of quad-
rants I and II are left at their original palaces. In sample
”S2” the overdensity associated with the Carina complex is
located in quadrant I between the outer rigs R1 and R2.
Sample ”S3” is made by applying the (l → 360◦ − l) trans-
formation to all objects. Here the overdensities associated
with the Perseus and Carina complexes are located in quad-
rants III and I, respectively. We can see that the χ2 curves
calculated successively for the samples ”Obs”, ”S1”, ”S2”,
and ”S3” have increasingly shallow minima.

Fig. 6 Distribution of the deviations (minimal distances) d
of young open clusters from the model positions of the outer

rings calculated for θb = 35
. It can be approximated by
the Gaussian law with a standard deviation of σr = 0.8 kpc
(the solid line). Deviations from the rings in the direction of
increasing y-coordinates are considered positive and those in
the opposite direction are considered negative. The excess of
positive deviations at d > 1.5 kpc is due to clusters located
in the direction of the anticenter. The fraction of clusters
located within 1.5 kpc (∼ 2σ) of the rings appears to be
95%, as expected in the case of the Gaussian law.

and angular size of a cluster, the number of resolved in-
dividual members and their visual brightness, the sur-
face density of ﬁeld stars, and the amount of extinction
along the line of sight (Morales et al. 2013).

Let us suppose that the probability of detection of
a cluster is determined mainly by the brightness of its
stars. Then the probability of cluster detection is a
function of its apparent distance modulus DM which
depends on the heliocentric distance to the cluster r
and the extinction AV toward it:

DM = 5 lg r + 10 + AV ,

(1)

where r is in kpc.

The probability P of detection of some objects is
usually assumed to be equal to unity within some re-
gion of parameters and to be exponentially decreasing
function beyond it. We can thus write the probability
P (DM ) in the following way:

P (DM ) = 




1

if DM < DM0

e−(DM−DM0)/s0

else,

(2)

where the scale factor s0 and zero point DM0 are de-
termined by ﬁtting between the distributions of the dis-
tance moduli DM of observed and model clusters.

To simulate the sample of clusters we adopted the
value of the solar position angle θtru and scattered
Nmod = 5000 model objects with respect to the outer
rings R1 and R2 in accordance with the Gaussian law
with the standard deviation of σr = 0.8 kpc within 3.5
kpc of the Sun, as it is shown in Figure 4b.

Note that among 564 young open clusters from the
catalog by Dias et al. (2002) located within r < 3.5
kpc, 408 objects ( 70%) appears to lie within 0.8 kpc
from one of the two outer rings, of those 262 (64%)
are located in the vicinity of the ring R2. We therefore
distributed simulated objects among two rings placing
64% of all objects in the ring R2.

To calculate the distance modulus for a model ob-
ject we must assign to it some value of the extinction
AV . That has been done in accordance with the extinc-
tion of observed young (log age < 8.00) clusters located
in the nearby region and derived from their colour ex-
cess AV = 3.1EB−V (Cardelli et al. 1989). For each
model objects situated at point (x, y) we selected ob-
served young clusters from the catalog by Dias et al.
(2002) located within the radius of re = 0.25 kpc from
the point (x, y), and calculated their average value

11

of extinction AV .
If there are less than ne < 10 ob-
served clusters in the region of radius re we succes-
sively increased the radius to re = 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00
kpc. The radius re = 1.0 kpc is the largest considered
and the corresponding region always includes at least
ne ≥ 2 observed clusters. Note that more than 93% of
model objects have extinction estimates AV averaged
over ne > 10 observed young clusters.

The distance moduli DM for model objects were cal-

culated as follows:

DM = 5 lg r + 10 + AV + η,

(3)

where η is the error of the estimated distance modu-
lus. We supposed that η is distributed according to
the Gaussian law with standard deviation σe, which is
proportional to the average extinction AV with some
factor ke:

σe = ke · AV ,

(4)

which is also determined, along with s0 and DM0, by
ﬁtting the distributions of distance moduli of model and
observed objects.

Figure 7 shows the distributions of the distance mod-
uli DM of observed and model clusters. The model
distribution is one of the best-ﬁtting obtained with the
parameters: s0 = 6.0m, ke = 0.55, and DM0 = 9.0m.
The diﬀerence in calculating the model and observed
distributions is that every model cluster is counted with
the weight factor P (DM ), but not as unit entity as it
was done for the observed distribution. We then nor-
malize the model distribution so that it would contain
the same number of clusters as the observed sample.
Thus the normalized number of model clusters N mod
in the bin DMi−1– DMi is determined as follows:

i

where j is the number of model clusters in the distance-
modulus bin considered, Pk(DM ) is the probability of
their detection, Nobs = 564 and Nmod = 5000 are the
numbers of observed and model clusters, respectively.
We computed the χ2 statistic for ﬁtting the distance
modulus distributions of the model and observed clus-
ters (Fig. 7) by the following formula:

Figure 8 shows the χ2 functions calculated from
Eq. 6 plotted versus one of the parameters s0, ke, and
DM0 with all other ﬁxed at their best-ﬁtting values of
s0 = 6.0, ke = 0.55, and DM0 = 9.0m. The selection
zero point DM0 is determined very poorly, but its χ2
function demonstrates a kink near ∼ 9m, where the con-
siderable growth follows the ﬂat distribution. We can
give only upper estimate of DM0 equal to ∼ 9m, which
in the case of zero extinction corresponds to r0 = 0.63
kpc. Generally, extinction must not be large near the
Sun and its presence must decrease the value of r0 as
well. Thus, the sample of young open clusters from the
catalog by Dias et al. (2002) can be regarded as com-
plete only within the radius r < 0.63 kpc.

Table 2 lists the values θtru of the angle θb used for
simulating random samples and the calculated values
θmin derived from the location of the minimum of the χ2
curve. We determined the θmin values for 200 simulated
samples and then averaged them. A comparison of θtru
and θmin reveals a small bias ∆s, so that the calculated
angles θmin are always greater than their true values.
For θmin = 35◦ this bias equals ∆s = −2.5◦.

However, if we suppose that the probability of detec-
tion of model clusters is P = 1 we obtain a systematical
correction with the opposite sign, ∆s = +5◦, so that the
calculated values are always smaller than the true ones.
Generally, this shift is due to the objects located in the
direction of the anticenter.

Note that the shift between the θtru and θmin val-
ues decreases with decreasing the scatter σr of model
objects with respect to the outer rings.

We tend to regard the θb = 35◦ value as a good com-
promise to account for the combined eﬀect of diﬀerent
factors. We summed the random ±5◦ and systemati-
cal ±5◦ errors because of their possible correlation to
obtain an upper limit of ∼ 10◦ for the combined error.
Note that our study of the sample of classical
Cepheids yields θb = 37 ± 13◦ for the position an-
gle of the Sun with respect to the bar’s major axis
(Mel’nik et al. 2015). And the cause of this coincidence
is that a tuning-fork-like structure is also present in the
Cepheid distribution.

3.2 Surface density and extinction in diﬀerent sectors

To study the distribution of clusters with respect to the
Sun, we calculated their surface density in the Galac-
tic plane. The variations in the surface density and
extinction toward clusters provide some information
about selection eﬀects and the distribution of dust in

in determination of the χ2 values and allows us to estimate
the errors: s0 = 6.0 ± 1.2m, ke = 0.55 ± 0.075, and DM0 =
9.0+0.8m
−3.0 . The parameter DM0 is poorly determined, but
its χ2 function shows a kink near ∼ 9m, where initially ﬂat
behavior turns into appreciable growth. Generally we can
give only upper estimate for DM0 equal to ∼ 9m.

the Galaxy. Here we verify the hypothesis that selec-
tion eﬀects, if we consider their inﬂuence in 45◦-width
sectors of the Galactic plane, aﬀect the sample of young
clusters in nearly the same way irrespective of the direc-
tion, implying that the density maxima in the Carina
and Perseus complexes can be attributed to real den-
sity enhancement rather than the lack of corresponding
observations in other sectors.

To study selection eﬀects, we subdivide the sample of
young open clusters into 8 subsamples conﬁned by 45◦-
width sectors: l = 0–45◦, 45–90◦, 90–135◦, 135–180◦,
180–225◦, 225–270◦, 270–315◦, and 315–360◦. For each
sector we calculate the number of clusters in annuli of
width ∆r = 0.5 kpc in the Galactic plane. The ratio of
the number of clusters in 1/8-th of an annulus to its area
gives us the average surface density of clusters in each
sector per kpc2. Table 3 lists the surface density values
n1, n2,..., n8 in diﬀerent sectors derived for diﬀerent
distance intervals r1 – r2. It also gives the total surface
density n0 averaged over all sectors and the standard
deviation σ0 of the surface densities n1, n2,..., n8 in
sectors 1–8 from the average surface density n0, which
depends only on distance.

Figure 9a shows the variations of surface densities
n1, n2,..., n8, and n0 along heliocentric distance r.
The density maxima corresponding to the Carina and
Perseus complexes are also indicated. The correspond-
ing peaks of surface density are underlined in Table 3.
The standard deviation σ0 in the distance interval 0.5–
3 kpc amounts, on average, to 40% of the total sur-
face density n0(r). The errors σp of the estimated
surface density n(r) in diﬀerent sectors caused by the
Poisson noise are, on average, twice smaller than the
corresponding standard deviation σ0 arising from the
scatter of values obtained for diﬀerent sectors. The av-
erage in the distance interval 1.5–2.5 kpc is σp = 4
cluster·kpc−2. The peaks in the Carina and Perseus
complexes can be seen to deviate signiﬁcantly from the
total surface density n0(r) – the deviations amount to
(1.9–2.1)σ0 or 3σp. We can hence conclude that these
regions of enhanced density really exist at a signiﬁcance
level of P ≥ 2σ0. We cannot say the same of the Sagit-
tarius complex (sector 1, r = 1–1.5 kpc), where sur-
face density exceeds the average value only by 0.7σ0 or
1.1σp. However, this density peak extends beyond the
corresponding sector and continues into the adjacent
sector (sector 8, r = 1–1.5 kpc) where density exceeds
the average value by 1σ0 or 1.2σp (Table 3).

We assume that surface density of clusters decreases
due to selection eﬀects at a power law rate: n(r) ∼ r−β .
We use seven surface density values in the interval 0–
3.5 kpc to determine exponent β and its error εβ for
functions n1(r), n2(r),..., n8(r), and n0(r) (Table 3).
The exponent β derived for the total distribution n0(r)
appears to be β = 1.03 ± 0.21 and the corresponding
exponents for diﬀerent sectors, as a rule, coincide with
this value within the errors. The only exception is the
sector 180–225◦ (5), where β = 1.62 ± 0.18. The steep
decline of surface density in this sector is possibly due
to the physical lack of clusters in quadrant III.

Figure 9b demonstrates the variations of extinction
AV toward open clusters along the distance r in diﬀer-
ent sectors of the Galactic plane. We calculated extinc-
tion AV for each sector and each distance range based
on the average colour excess of open clusters located
there. Also shown is the average extinction A0
V (r) cal-
culated for all sectors. The mean uncertainty of sector-
averaged AV values is 0.4m. Several interesting features
are immediately apparent. First, extinction grows most
rapidly in the sectors 0–45◦ (1), 45–90◦ (2) and 315–
360◦ (8). Second, the minimal values of extinction are
observed in the direction of the Carina complex 270–
315◦ (7) and in the direction of the anticenter 225–270◦
(6). Third, variations of extinction in the sector of the
Perseus stellar-gas complex 90–135◦ (3) are very close
to those of average extinction A0
V .

Note that we found similar features in variations
of extinction for classical Cepheids (Mel’nik et al.
2015). Both groups of young objects, open clus-
ters and Cepheids, show a sharp growth of extinction
in the direction toward the Galactic center (see also
Neckel & Klare 1980; Marshall et al. 2006). This steep
increase can be attributed to the presence of the Galac-
tic outer ring R1 at the heliocentric distance 1–2 kpc in
this direction. The other feature – lower extinction in
the direction of the Carina complex 270–315◦ – can also
be seen in the sample of classical Cepheids. Generally,
low extinction in some direction means that the line of
sight crosses interstellar medium with lower concentra-
tion of dust. Probably, there is a lack of dust in the
space between the Sun and the Carina complex. The
same is true for the anticenter direction. Moreover, lack
of dust often correlates with lack of gas (Xu et al. 1997;
Amˆores & Lepine 2005, and references therein).

3.3 Rotation curve

We use the sample of young (log age < 8.00) open clus-
ters from the catalog by Dias et al. (2002) to deter-
mine the parameters of the rotation curve and com-
pare them with those derived from the samples of OB-
associations and classical Cepheids. We selected open

clusters located within 3 kpc from the Sun and within
0.5 kpc (|z| < 0.5 kpc) from the Galactic plane.
In
total, we have 187 young clusters with known proper
motions, and 212 with known line-of-sight velocities.
The line-of-sight velocities of clusters were taken from
the catalogue by Dias et al. (2002, version 3.4). Of
them ∼ 50% were determined by Dias et al. (2014).
We use only line-of-sight velocities and proper motions
determined from the data for at least two cluster mem-
bers (nvr ≥ 2, npm ≥ 2). Of 187 cluster proper mo-
tions 53 were adopted from the list by Baumgardt et al.
(2000) and the remaining 134 proper motions, from the
list by Glushkova et al. (1996, 1997), which is avail-
able at http://www.sai.msu.su/groups/cluster/cl/pm/.
The proper motions used in this study are derived or
reduced to the Hipparcos system (Hipparcos 1997).

We suppose that the motion of young objects in the
disk obeys a circular rotation law. Then we can write
the so-called Bottlinger equations for the line-of-sight
velocities Vr and proper motions along Galactic longi-
tude µl:

Vr = R0 · (Ω − Ω0) · sin l · cos b

−(u0 · cos l · cos b + v0 · sin l · cos b + w0 · sin b),

4.74 · µl · r = R0 · (Ω − Ω0) · cos l − Ω · r · cos b

−(−u0 · sin l + v0 · cos l).

(8)

The parameters Ω and Ω0 are the angular rotation
velocities at the Galactocentric distance R and at the
distance of the Sun R0, respectively. The velocity com-
ponents u0 and v0 characterize the solar motion with
respect to the centroid of objects considered in the di-
rection toward the Galactic center and Galactic rota-
tion, respectively. The velocity component w0 is di-
rected along the z-coordinate and we set it equal to
w0 = 7.0 km s−1. The factor 4.74 converts the left-
hand part of Eq. 8 (where proper motion and distance
are in mas yr−1 and kpc, respectively) into the units of
km s−1.

We expanded the angular rotation velocity Ω at
Galactocentric distance R into a power series in (R −
R0):

Ω = Ω0 + Ω

0 · (R − R0) + 0.5 · Ω

′′
0 · (R − R0)2,

where Ω′
taken at the solar Galactocentric distance.

0 and Ω′′

0 are its ﬁrst and second derivatives

We simultaneously solve the equations for the line-of-
sight velocities and proper motions. We also use weight

factors pvr and pvl to balance the errors of line-of-sight
and transversal velocity components:

pvr = (σ2

0 + ε2

vr)

−1/2,

pvl = (σ2

0 + (4.74 · εµl · r)2)

(11)

where σ0 is the so-called ”cosmic” velocity disper-
sion, which is approximately equal to the rms devi-
ation of the velocities from the rotation curve (for
more details see Dambis et al. 1995; Mel’nik et al. 1999;
Mel’nik & Dambis 2009). We adopted the errors of the
line-of-sight velocities εvr and proper motions εµl from
the corresponding catalogues.

We used an iterative cycle with 3σ clipping to deter-
mine both the parameters of motion and the ”cosmic”
velocity dispersion σ0. At each iteration the line-of-
sight velocities that deviate by more than 3σ0 from the
computed rotation curve were eliminated. We also ex-
cluded proper motions which deviate by more than 6.0
mas yr−1 (3 · 2 mas yr−1, where 2 mas yr−1 is the
average error of proper motions considered) from the
rotation curve. The rotation curve and solar motion
parameters remain practically unchanged in subsequent
iterations, but σ0 decreases from 23 to 15 km s−1. The
ﬁnal sample includes 156 and 209 equations for proper
motions and line-of-sight velocities, respectively.

Table 4 lists the ﬁnal values of the parameters of
the rotation curve Ω0, Ω′
0, Ω′′
0 and solar motion u0, v0
and the ﬁnal value of velocity dispersion σ0 calculated
for young open clusters. Also listed are the number
of conditional equations N and the value of Oort con-
stant A = −0.5R0Ω′. For comparison we also give the
parameters derived for the sample of OB-associations
(Mel’nik & Dambis 2009) and those inferred for classi-
cal Cepheids (Mel’nik et al. 2015). We can see a good
agreement between the parameters obtained for young
open clusters and OB-associations (see also Fig. 10).

Note the large value of Ω0 = 30.3 ± 1.2 km s−1
kpc−1 obtained for young open clusters, which co-
incides with that calculated for OB-associations and
maser sources, Ω0 = 31 ± 1 km s−1 kpc−1 (Reid at al.
2009a; Mel’nik & Dambis 2009; Bobylev & Baikova
2010). On the other hand, the angular velocity Ω0
at the solar Galactocentric distance estimated from
the kinematics of Cepheids (Feast & Whitelock 1997;
Bobylev & Baikova 2012) is systematically lower than
the value derived from young open clusters and OB-
associations. The parameters computed for young open
clusters and Cepheids are consistent within the errors
except for the second derivative Ω′′
0 , which is equal to

16

1.65 ± 0.29 and 1.07 ± 0.17 km s−2 kpc−1, respectively
(Table 4). Moreover, the rotation curve of Cepheids
seems to be slightly descending, whereas that of OB-
associations is nearly ﬂat within the 3 kpc. The cause
of this discrepancy is currently not clear.

The standard deviation of the velocities from the ro-
tation curve equals σ0 = 15.2, 7.16 and 10.84 km s−1
for young open clusters, OB-associations and Cepheids,
respectively (Table 4), which is consistent with other
estimates (e.g.
Zabolotskikh et al. 2002). The larger
value of σ0 = 15.2 km s−1 derived for clusters reﬂects
the quality of the kinematical data rather than the
physical scatter: all these objects are quite young, their
ages do not exceed 200 Myr and they all must demon-
strate the same physical scatter with respect to rotation
curve to within 1–2 km s−1. Possibly, the crowding in
cluster ﬁelds prevents accurate measurements of line-of-
light velocities and proper motions. Furthermore, the
line-of-sight velocities of young open clusters are based
on measured velocities of early-type stars, which usu-
ally have low accuracy because of the small number and
large width of spectral lines involved.

3.4 Residual velocities of young open clusters and

model particles

Residual velocities characterize non-circular motions in
the Galactic disk. We calculated them as the diﬀer-
ences between the observed heliocentric velocities and
the computed velocities due to the circular rotation law
and the adopted components of the solar motion de-
ﬁned by the parameters listed in Table 4 (ﬁrst line).
For model particles the residual velocities are deter-
mined with respect to the model rotation curve. We
consider the residual velocities in the radial VR and
azimuthal VT directions. Positive radial residual ve-
locities VR are directed away from the Galactic center,

clusters (the black line), which practically coincides with
that obtained for OB-associations (the gray line). The ro-
tation curve computed for Cepheids lies systematically lower
(the dashed line). The circle shows position of the Sun.

while positive azimuthal residual velocities VT are in
the sense of Galactic rotation.

The velocity ﬁeld of gas clouds moving along the
outer elliptic galactic rings is characterized by alterna-
tion of the negative and positive radial residual veloc-
ities VR directed toward and away from the galactic
center, respectively (Mel’nik & Rautiainen 2009).
In
the ascending segments of the rings (trailing spiral frag-
ments) gas clouds have positive velocities VR directed
away from the galactic center, while in the descending
segments (leading spiral fragments), on the contrary,
VR is directed toward the center. This becomes clear
when we remember that outer rings lie outside the CR
of the bar. Hence, in the reference frame co-rotating
with the bar gas clouds rotate along the outer rings in
the sense opposite that of galactic rotation, i.e. move
in the sense of decreasing azimuthal angle θ. In the de-
scending segments, as deﬁned, galactocentric distance
R increases with increasing azimuthal angle θ (leading
spiral arm fragments), but if objects rotate in the sense
of decreasing angle θ the distance R must decrease. So
in the descending segments of the outer rings objects
must approach the galactic center. In the 3 kpc solar
neighborhood there is only one descending segment of
the outer rings – that of the ring R2. Hence within
3 kpc of the Sun, objects with negative velocities VR
must outline the location of the ring R2.

Figure 11a shows the distribution of young open clus-
ters (log age < 8.00) and OB-associations with negative
radial residual velocities (VR < 0) in the Galactic plane.
The sample includes 90 objects (57 clusters and 33 OB-
associations) located within 3 kpc from the Sun. We
consider only OB-associations with the line-of-sight ve-
locity and proper motion based on data for at least two
cluster members (nvr ≥ 2, npm ≥ 2), and the same
is true for open clusters. Within r < 3.0 kpc from
the Sun, the elliptic ring R2 can be represented as a
fragment of the leading spiral arm. We solve 90 equa-
tions by χ2-minimization (Press et al. 1987) to ﬁnd the
parameters of the spiral law. The pitch angle of the
spiral-arm derived from clusters and OB-associations
appears to be i = 20 ± 5◦. The positive value of the
pitch angle i indicates that Galactocentric distance R
increases with increasing azimuthal angle θ what corre-
sponds to the leading spiral arm fragment and suggests
the solar position near the descending segment of the
outer ring. Both types of objects, young clusters and
OB-associations, give the same result: i = 19.3 ± 6.7◦
and i = 20.3 ± 6.4◦, respectively. Obviously, these ob-
jects demonstrate similar behavior.

Note that the pitch angle i = 20 ± 5◦ obtained for
clusters and OB-associations diﬀers strongly from the
value derived for model particles i = 6.6 ± 0.6◦. The

cause of this discrepancy is that objects of the Perseus
and Carina complexes deviate from the smooth contour
of the outer ring R2.
If we exclude the most distant
parts of these regions, for example, by reducing the
neighborhood considered from 3 to 2 kpc from the Sun,
the pitch angle estimate decreases from i = 20 ± 5◦
to i = 11.4 ± 5.3◦. The latter value was derived for
60 objects (39 clusters and 21 OB-associations) lo-
cated within r < 2 kpc of the Sun. The values of
i = 11.4 ± 5.3◦ and i = 6.6 ± 0.6◦ obtained for ob-
served objects and model particles are consistent within
the errors. The value of i = 11.4 ± 5.3◦ is positive at
the signiﬁcance level P > 2σ, which means that the
spiral fragment to which young open clusters and OB-
associations concentrate is leading.

In this context the question of the ragged structure
of the ring R2 comes up. Though the deviations from
the smooth contour of the ring R2 can result from er-
rors in the parameters of distant objects, there is an-
other aspect of the problem. A two-component outer
ring R1R2 usually includes not just a pure R2 ring but
a pseudoring R′
2 (broken ring) (Buta 1995). Such de-
viations from pure ring morphology are also observed
in numerical simulations (e.g. Rautiainen & Salo 2000,
Figure 3) with the break usually located on the de-
scending segment of the ring. Hence the fact that the
Perseus and Carina complexes deviate from the smooth
elliptic segment in diﬀerent directions – away from the
Galactic center in the Perseus stellar-gas complex and
toward the center in the Carina complex – may indicate
the pseudoring morphology. This question requires fur-
ther study.

The residual azimuthal velocity VT also oscillates
along the elliptic ring. These oscillations are shifted by
π/4 in phase with respect to those of the radial velocity
VR and are associated with ordered epicyclic motion of
gas clouds and young stars near the OLR of the bar
(Mel’nik & Rautiainen 2009).

Figure 11b shows the dependence of azimuthal resid-
ual velocity VT on coordinate x for young open clusters,
OB-associations and model particles with negative ra-
dial residual velocities (VR < 0). These objects are sup-
posed to belong to the descending segment of the outer
ring R2 and must show the decrease of VT with increas-
ing x. The regression coeﬃcient calculated for young
clusters and OB-associations located within 3 kpc of the
Sun is k = −1.85±0.90 and diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the
value calculated for model particles k = −3.45 ± 0.07.
However, if we leave only OB-associations we would get
k = −3.03 ± 0.85, which is negative at signiﬁcance level
of P > 3σ and agrees well with the model value.

4 Discussion and conclusions

We study the distribution and kinematics of young
open clusters from the catalogue by Dias et al. (2002)
in terms of the model of the Galactic ring R1R′
2
(Mel’nik & Rautiainen 2009). The best agreement be-
tween the distribution of observed clusters and model
particles is achieved for the solar position angle of
θb = 35 ± 10◦ with respect to the bar major axis. It
is due to of ”the tuning-fork-like” structure in the dis-
tribution of clusters: at negative x-coordinates most of
the clusters concentrate to the only one arm (the Carina
arm), while at positive x-coordinates most of the clus-
ters lie near the Perseus or the Sagittarius complexes
(Fig. 2).

We studied the inﬂuence of objects located in dif-
ferent regions on the position of the minimum of the
χ2 curve. Excluding the clusters lying within the 0.5-
kpc region (r < 0.5 kpc) from the observed sample
decreases the value of θmin from 35 to 30◦, while the
exclusion of distant clusters located in the direction of
the anticenter (y > 2.5 kpc) increases θmin from 35 to
40◦.

Fig. 11 Comparison of the distribution of young open clusters (log age < 8.00) (the circles colored blue in electronic
edition) and OB-associations (the asterisks colored green in electronic edition) with that of model particles (gray circles).
We selected only objects with radial residual velocities directed toward the Galactic center (VR < 0). The positions of
◦
model particles (gas and OB particles) are calculated for the solar position angle θb = 45
. (a) Distribution of observed
objects and model particles in the Galactic plane. The selected clusters and OB-associations must outline the descending
segment of the outer ring R2, i. e. concentrate to a fragment of a leading spiral. The X-axis is directed in the sense of the
Galactic rotation and the Y -axis, away from the Galactic center. The Sun is at the origin. (b) Dependence of azimuthal
residual velocity VT on coordinate x for objects with VR < 0. All objects demonstrate the decrease in VT with increasing x.

We performed mirror reﬂection of the distribution of
observed clusters with respect to the Y -axis, which is
identical to the (l → 360◦ − l) transformation. The re-
ﬂection obliterates the minimum of the χ2 curve. After
the reﬂection clusters form a tuning-fork-like structure
pointed in the opposite direction (one segment at the
positive x-coordinates and two segments at the negative
x-coordinates), which is inconsistent with the position
of the outer rings calculated for θb = 15–45◦.

We simulated the inﬂuence of selection eﬀects by as-
signing to every model object the probability P of its
detection depending on its apparent distance modulus
DM . The probability P is assumed to be equal to unity
for DM < DM0 and decrease exponentially with DM
at DM ≥ DM0 (Eq. 2). We determined the parameters
of the dependence P (DM ) by ﬁtting the distributions
of distance moduli DM of the observed and model clus-
ters (Figs. 7, 8). We computed the extinction AV for
model objects in accordance with the extinction of ob-
served clusters located in the nearby region. We scat-
tered the model clusters in the vicinity of the model
positions of the outer rings and computed the χ2 func-
tion for 200 model samples. A comparison of the θtru
and θmin values reveals a small bias ∆s = −2.5◦ which
does not exceed the random errors of ±5◦ (Table 2).

We consider the value of θb = 35◦ as a good com-
promise reﬂecting the combined inﬂuence of diﬀerent

eﬀects. The upper limit of the combined error includ-
ing random and systematic errors is ±10◦.

An analysis of the surface density n of young clus-
ters in diﬀerent sectors of the Galactic plane suggests
a weak dependence of selection eﬀects on the direc-
tion. We found that extinction AV toward open clus-
ters grows most rapidly in the direction of the Galac-
tic center (l = 315–360◦ and 0–45◦) and in the sec-
tor 45–90◦, while it is minimal in the direction of the
the Carina complex 270–315◦ and the anticenter 225–
270◦. Note that we found similar features in the varia-
tions of extinction for classical Cepheids (Mel’nik et al.
2015). Possibly, the sharp growth of extinction can be
attributed to the presence of the Galactic outer ring R1
at the heliocentric distance 1–2 kpc in the direction to
the Galactic center.

The parameters of the rotation curve derived from
the sample of young open clusters agree well with those
obtained for OB-associations (Mel’nik & Dambis 2009,
Table 4). The rotation curve is nearly ﬂat in the 3 kpc
solar neighborhood with the large value of the Galactic
angular velocity at the solar radius Ω0 = 30.3 ± 1.2 km
s−1 kpc−1.

We study the distribution of young open clusters
and OB-associations with negative radial residual ve-
locities VR, which within 3 kpc of the Sun must out-
line the descending segment of the ring R2. Clusters

19

and OB-association demonstrate similar distribution
in the Galactic plane: objects of both types concen-
trate to the fragment of the leading spiral arm (see also
Mel’nik 2005). Within 2 kpc from the Sun, the pitch
angles of the spiral fragment derived for model particles
i = 6.0 ± 0.5◦ and observed objects i = 11.4 ± 5.3◦ are
consistent within the errors.

We also found the azimuthal velocity VT to decrease
with increasing coordinate x for objects with negative
radial residual velocities (VR < 0). The regression coef-
ﬁcient calculated for 33 OB-associations located within
3 kpc of the Sun, k = −3.03 ± 0.85, agrees well with the
value k = −3.45 ± 0.07 calculated for model particles.
features dis-
cussed have also been found for the sample of classical
Cepheids (Mel’nik et al. 2015). Thus, all types of ob-
jects – young open clusters, OB-associations and clas-
sical Cepheids – suggest the presence of the outer ring
