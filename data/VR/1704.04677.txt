Abstract. We propose a novel design of a parallel manipulator of Stewart Gough type for vir-
tual reality application of single individuals; i.e. an omni-directional treadmill is mounted on the
motion platform in order to improve VR immersion by giving feedback to the human body. For
this purpose we modify the well-known octahedral manipulator in a way that it has one degree
of kinematical redundancy; namely an equiform reconﬁgurability of the base. The instantaneous
kinematics and singularities of this mechanism are studied, where especially ”unavoidable singu-
larities” are characterized. These are poses of the motion platform, which can only be realized by
singular conﬁgurations of the mechanism despite its kinematic redundancy.

Key words: Stewart-Gough platform, Kinematic redundancy, Singularities, Motion simulator

1 Introduction

The geometry of a Stewart-Gough (SG) platform is given by the six base anchor
points Mi with coordinates Mi := (Ai, Bi,Ci)T with respect to the ﬁxed frame and
by the six platform anchor points mi with coordinates mi := (ai, bi, ci)T with respect
to the moving frame (for i = 1, . . . , 6). Each pair (Mi, mi) of corresponding anchor
points of the ﬁxed body (base) and the moving body (platform) is connected by an
SPS-leg, where only the prismatic joint (P) is active and the spherical joints (S) are
passive. The distance between the centers of the two S-joints of the ith leg is denoted
by ri. Note that for a SG platform, (Mi, mi) (cid:54)= (M j, m j) holds for pairwise distinct
i, j ∈ {1, . . . , 6}. Moreover if two base points Mi and M j (resp. platform points mi
and m j) coincide, then we just write Mi, j (resp. mi, j).

A certain drawback of such 6-degree of freedom (dof) robotic platforms is the
limitation of their singularity-free workspace. A promising approach for overcom-
ing this problem is redundancy, where basically two types can be distinguished:

(a) Actuation redundancy: One possibility is to add a 7th SPS-leg to the manipu-
lator (e.g. [1, 2, 3]), but it should be noted that there exist dangerous locations
for the attachments m7 and M7 (cf. [4]), which do not result in a reduction of
singularities. Clearly more than one SPS-leg can be attached, but we have to

keep in mind that every extra leg may yields a restriction of the workspace due
to leg constraints and leg interference [1]. Moreover [5] pointed out that this
so-called branch redundancy1 causes internal loads, whose control increases
considerably the complexity and costs.

(b) Kinematic redundancy: This can be achieved by attaching active joints in a
way that the geometry of the platform or base (or both) can be modiﬁed. There-
fore they are also known as reconﬁgurable manipulators2 of SG type. In [8] a
design is suggested, which has six redundant dofs (3 in the platform and 3 in
the base). The weak points of this so-called dodekapod are that on the one hand
additional mass/inertia (motor of active joints) is added to the platform and that
on the other hand passive prismatic joints are used, which are difﬁcult to im-
plement in practice (cf. [5]). Not faced with these points of criticism are the
designs suggested in [9, 10], where one base point is traced on a circle (realized
by an extra R-joint [9]) or a straight line (realized by an extra P-joint [10]).
We complete this review by noting a different approach to kinematic redun-
dancy; namely the usage of parallel redundant legs introduced in [5].

Another advantage of approach (b) over (a) beside the already mentioned ones above
is that (a) increases the workspace only by removing singularities, but (b) addition-
ally enlarges the workspace itself due to the reconﬁgurability of the anchor points.
Further differences between both concepts are pointed out at the end of Section 2.1.

1.1 Aim and basic concept

Within the Doctoral College ”Computational Design” of the Vienna University of
Technology, we are interested amongst other things in the optimization of mo-
tion platforms of SG type for virtual reality (VR) application of single individ-
uals. In detail, we want to mount an omni-directional treadmill onto the motion
platform (cf. Fig. 2) in order to improve VR immersion by giving feedback to the
human body (e.g. simulating slopes, earthquakes, . . . ). There are different loco-
motion systems commercially available; e.g. Cyberith Virtualizer (cyberith.com),
Omni Virtuix (www.virtuix.com), SpaceWalkerVR (spacewalkervr.com), Kat
Walk (www.katvr.com) and Wizdish ROVR (www.wizdish.com).

Due to safety reasons we prefer a system where the individuals are ﬁxed inside
a hip-ring by belts and straps. Thus we are only left with the Omni Virtuix and
the Cyberith Virtualizer. We favor the latter system as it has one more dof, which
allows to kneel/crouch/sit down or even to jump up, and a ﬂat base plate with a
suitable friction coefﬁcient for simulating slopes. Contrary, the Omni Virtuix’s base
has a very low friction (too slippery for slope simulations) and a concave shape.

1 A further possibility to imply actuation redundancy in a SG platform is to replace passive joints
by active ones. No attempts to this so-called in-branch redundancy are known to the authors.
2 The modules in a variable geometry truss (VGT) can also be seen as reconﬁgurable manipulators
(cf. [6, Fig. 9]). In this context see also [7], where a VGT is combined with a SG structure.

Fig. 1 (Left) SG manipulator with planar semi-hexagonal base and platform. (Right) Octahedral
SG manipulator, which is also known as MSSM (Minimal Simpliﬁed Symmetric Manipulator) in
the literature (e.g. [11]). This parallel robot is characterized by: m1 = m2, m3 = m4, m5 = m6,
M2 = M3, M4 = M5, M6 = M1. Therefore all attachments are double spherical joints, which form
a triangle in the platform and the base. Moreover we assume that both triangles are equilateral.

All currently offered 6-dof motion simulators of SG type have a planar semi-
hexagonal base and platform (see Fig. 1 (left)). This design is preferred over the
so-called octahedral SG manipulator (see Fig. 1 (right)) as it avoids double S-joints,
which have a lot of disadvantages regarding costs, stiffness and joint-range. Never-
theless we focus within this concept study on the octahedral design (as many other
academic studies e.g. [7], [9, Section 4], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], . . . done in the
past), due to its kinematic simplicity. But this application-alien abstraction can also
be brought back to real-world solutions as pointed out in Section 3.

Due to the arguments given above we want to use concept (b) of kinematic redun-
dancy in order to increase the singularity-free workspace of the octahedral manipu-
lator. Having our practical application in mind, the resulting reconﬁgurable manipu-
lator should still be of kinematic simplicity (the symmetry of the manipulator should
not be destroyed) and cheap ; i.e. we want to get by with standard components (less
or even no expensive custom products).

Taking all these requests under consideration, we came up with the design illus-
trated in Fig. 2. We use three additional active P-joints (green), which are driven
simultaneously by only one motor mounted at the center of the base. Therefore the
base triangle remains equilateral during the reconﬁguration process. The proposed
manipulator can be seen as a combination of a SG hexapod and a so-called hexaglide
(e.g. [18]). As the linear sliding of the points Mi,i+1 along the lines gi,i+1 can be re-
alized by parallel guiding rails, the whole structure can still be built very stiff with
a high load-carrying capacity. Moreover the complete additional equipment for the
performance of the reconﬁguration (motor, rails, . . . ) is placed on the resting base
such that the legs and platform are not stressed by additional mass/inertia.

Remark 1. Let us assume that the three additional prismatic joints are passive instead
of active (but still coupled). Moreover we lock the six P-joints of the legs. Then the
base has in each pose of the manipulator at least a 1-dimensional self-motion with
respect to the platform, due to the equiform reconﬁgurability of the base. These
(cid:5)
relative motions (of the base with respect to the platform) are studied in [16].

an universal joint (U), thus all double S-joints can be replaced by concentric SU-joints (blow-ups).

2 Instantaneous kinematics and singularities

The ith leg of the 7-dof reconﬁgurable manipulator fulﬁlls the basic relation ri(τ)2 =
(cid:107)ni(τ) − Mi(τ)(cid:107)2, where ni is the coordinate vector of mi with respect to the ﬁxed
system. Differentiation with respect to the time τ yields:

ri ˙ri = (ni − Mi)( ˙ni − ˙Mi) ⇒ ˙ri = li( ˙ni − ˙Mi),

(1)

where li is the unit-vector along the ith leg (pointing from the base point to the
platform point). As the velocity of ni can be expressed in terms of the instantaneous
screw (q, (cid:98)q) of the platform with respect to the ﬁxed system by ˙n = (cid:98)q + q × ni we
get:

˙ri + li ˙Mi = li(cid:98)q + li(q × ni) ⇒ ˙ri + ˙ggili = li(cid:98)q +(cid:98)liq,
where gi is the unit-vector along gi, ˙g the velocity along gi and(cid:98)li the moment vector
of the ith leg. Note that (li,(cid:98)li) are the spear coordinates of the ith leg. Thus we end
up with:

This equation relates the velocities ˙r1, . . . , ˙r6, ˙g of the active P-joints with the instan-
taneous screw (q, (cid:98)q) of the platform. If we ﬁx all prismatic joints the left side of
Eq. (3) equals the zero vector. Then an inﬁnitesimal motion of the platform is only
possible if the Jacobian matrix J of the octahedral manipulator is singular; which is
well studied problem (e.g. [13, 15] or [11, pages 202–204]).

2.1 Unavoidable singularities

Deﬁnition 1. If for a given pose of the platform the corresponding conﬁguration of
the mechanism is singular for all kinematically redundant dofs, we call this singular
pose of the platform an ”unavoidable singularity”.

To the best knowledge of the authors there are no studies on ”unavoidable singu-

larities” in the literature, with the following two exceptions:

• In [5, Section V(D)] it is stated that for the octahedral manipulator with three
redundant legs ”any Cartesian pose of the moving platform can be reached with
a non-singular conﬁguration of the mechanism”. Moreover, it is ”conjectured that
this result can be extended to mechanisms whose spherical joints on the platform
do not coincide by pairs”, but this is disproved in Appendix A.

• For the kinematically redundant SG manipulator of [9], there exist up to 40 po-
sitions of the platform causing an unavoidable singularity for a given orientation
(cf. [9, Section 4.4.2]). Some special orientations causing a higher-dimensional
set of unavoidable singularities were studied in [9, Section 4.4.3].

For the proposed mechanism of the paper at hand, we can chose an appropriate
scaling factor and coordinate systems in the ﬁxed and moving space in a way that:

m1,2 = (1, 0, 0)T ,
M4,5 = g(−1, 0, 0)T ,

hold, where g > 0 is the reconﬁguration variable (= radius of the circumcircle of the
equilateral base triangle). Based on this coordinatization we can compute the entries
of J by (li :(cid:98)li) := (Rmi + s − NMi : Mi × li) with the rotation matrix

Proof. For an unavoidable singularity the conditions Q = L = A1A2 = 0 have to
hold. This system of equations can be solved explicitly3 for x, y, z. The detailed case
study yielding the above table is presented in Appendix B. Note that for a given

orientation the positions are (unions of) afﬁne subspaces of R3.

Fig. 3 Singularity avoidance by kinematical redundancy: In the upper left picture the given motion
of the platform between the start- and end-pose is displayed. Without reconﬁguration of the base the
manipulator will pass two singular conﬁgurations, which are highlighted in red. They correspond
to the two intersection points of the blue horizontal line and the red singularity curve in the diagram
in the upper right corner. One can avoid these singularities by performing a reconﬁguration of the
base indicated by the dashed line in the diagram, but then there is a collision of legs in the end-pose,
which is illustrated in the lower left picture. The green parabola in the diagram corresponds to a
solution, which is free of leg-interference and singularities. The robot-conﬁguration of this solution
with g = max is displayed in the lower right picture. An animation can be downloaded from:
http://www.geometrie.tuwien.ac.at/nawratil/reconfiguration.gif

As the unavoidable singularities are low-dimensional varieties (cf. Theorem 1)
in the 6-dimensional workspace, they can always be bypassed during path-planning.
But this does not imply the existence of a singularity-free path as the singularity va-
riety is a hypersurface in the mechanism’s conﬁguration space.4 Due to topological
reasons two points of the conﬁguration space can be separated by this hypersurface.
In contrast, actuation redundancy reduces the dimension of the singularity variety
by the number of redundant dofs (cf. [1, Section 3]) and therefore a singularity can
always be avoided during path-planning.

But in the case of a given path of the platform, kinematic redundancy is superior
to actuation redundancy, as kinematically redundant dofs can be used to avoid sin-
gularities (if possible) and to increase the performance of the manipulator during the

4 For our mechanism this is a 7-dimensional space, as a mechanism conﬁguration is given by the
pose of the platform (6 dofs) and by the size of the base triangle (1 dof).

of the proposed mechanism during a given motion is dedicated to future research.

Remark 2. Note that a so-called modular parallel robot [19] also changes its geom-
etry with respect to a given end-effector motion, but there is no reconﬁguration of
the robot’s base/platform during the motion of the end-effector.

3 Conclusion

This paper contains a concept study of an octahedral SG manipulator with one de-
gree of kinematic redundancy (equiform reconﬁgurability of the base) for VR sim-
ulations of single individuals (see Fig. 2). In a side-note we also proposed SU-joints
(see Fig. 2) as an alternative to the problematic double S-joints within the octahedral
structure. Clearly a deeper study of these SU-joints (regarding stiffness, joint-range,
dynamic behavior, . . . ) has to be done in order to judge their applicability. Another
possibility is the substitution of all double S-joints by double U-joints (e.g. see [12,
Fig. 16] and [14, Section 4]) and to replace the P-joints by cylindrical joints, with a
passive rotation and an active translation component.

But we pursue another strategy for the technical realization; namely the usage
of a design which is totally free of double joints but kinematically equivalent to the
octahedral manipulator (cf. [20]). Therefore the resulting design illustrated in Fig. 4
can be built with standard components; i.e. without expensive custom products.

Fig. 5 Non-redundant legs are displayed in black and redundant ones are illustrated in red. In the
upper row the axonometric views and in the lower row the top views of a non-singular conﬁguration
(left) and an unavoidable singularity (right), respectively, are given.

Appendix A

As already mentioned in the ﬁrst bullet of Subsection 2.1, the authors of [5] stated in
Section Section V(D) that for the octahedral manipulator with three redundant legs
”any Cartesian pose of the moving platform can be reached with a non-singular
conﬁguration of the mechanism”.5 Moreover, it is ”conjectured that this result can
be extended to mechanisms whose spherical joints on the platform do not coincide
by pairs”. In this section we construct a counter example to the conjecture.

According to Assumption 1 of [5, Section V(D)] the base anchor points have to

fulﬁll the following property:

Mi,a, Mi,b, Mi−1 are collinear for i = 1, 3, 5 (mod 6),

(12)

where Mi−1 is the base point of a non-redundant leg and Mi,a, Mi,b denote the two
base anchor points of a redundant leg. The geometric structure of the redundant leg

5 This is only true under Assumption 2 of [5, Section V(D)]. Without this assumption all poses
where the platform and the base are coplanar are ”unavoidable singularities”.

can be seen in Fig. 5 (upper left). It should only be noted that the orange cylinders
represent passive rotational joints and that the 3 gray bars linked by this joint are
coplanar.

We start with a semi-hexagonal platform parallel to the base plane δ . Then we
determine the corresponding base point(s) of m j as follows: We construct a plane
ε j orthogonal to δ , which touches the circumcircle of the semi-hexagonal platform
in m j. The intersection line of ε j and δ is illustrated in Fig. 5 (left) in red (for
j = 1, 3, 5) and blue (for j = 2, 4, 6), respectively. Under consideration of (12) we
select the base point(s) on these intersection lines.

Then we rotate the platform by −90 degrees about the center axis a and end up
with a singular conﬁguration (so-called Fichter singularity [12]) illustrated in Fig. 5
(right). It can easily be checked that this is an unavoidable singularity.

Appendix B

We split the proof of Theorem 1 into two subsections. In the ﬁrst one very special
cases are discussed and in the second one we attack the general case.

Special cases

1. Within this ﬁrst item we study all cases where at least two of the four Euler

parameters are zero.

a. e1 = e2 = 0: Then Q and L are fulﬁlled identically and we remain with

A1A2 = 0, which factors into

z3(e2

0 + e2

3)(e0 − e3)(e0 + e3) = 0.

(13)

For z = 0 the legs are in a ﬁeld of lines, whose carrier plane is the base (⇒
row 1 of the table given in Theorem 1). For e0 = ±e3 we get the Fichter
singularity (cf. [12]); i.e. rotation of the platform by ±90◦ about the z-axis
(⇒ row 2).

b. e0 = e3 = 0: This is already a singular conﬁguration (⇒ row 3), which is

not of practical relevance as the platform is upside down.

c. e0 = e2 = 0 and e1e3 (cid:54)= 0: It can easily be seen that Q = L = A1A2 = 0 can
only hold for z = e1e3 (⇒ row 13). The lines are in a singular linear line
complex.

d. e1 = e3 = 0 and e0e2 (cid:54)= 0: Analogous considerations as in item (1c) yield
z = −e0e2 (⇒ row 14). The lines are in a singular linear line complex.
e. e0 = e1 = 0 and e2e3 (cid:54)= 0: It is not difﬁcult to verify that the unavoidable

singularities are given by y = z = 0 (⇒ row 15).

f. e2 = e3 = 0 and e0e1 (cid:54)= 0: Analogous considerations as in item (1e) yield

y = z = 0 (⇒ row 16).

2. e0 = e3 (cid:54)= 0: In this case Q factors into

2e3

3(e1 + e2)(e1 − 2e2 −

3e2)(e1 − 2e2 +

3e2).

We remain with the following three cases:

a. e2 = −e1 and e3 (cid:54)= 0: Now we get

L = 4e2

1e3(z − 2e1e3)(e1z + 2e2

A1A2 = 4xe1e3(z − 2e1e3)(2e1e3y − e2

1e3 + 2e3
3z + e2

3 + ye3),
1z),

(14)

(15)

thus the following cases can occur:

i. e1 = 0: We get again the Fichter singularity.
ii. z = 2e1e3 and e1 (cid:54)= 0: In this case all legs intersect a line and therefore
they belong to a singular linear line complex (⇒ row 4, upper sign).

iii. e1z + 2e2

1e3 + 2e3

3 + ye3 = 0 and (z − 2e1e3)e1 (cid:54)= 0: We can solve this
equation for z and then A1A2 can only vanish without contradiction for
x = 0 (⇒ row 5, upper sign) or y = 2e2
3 (⇒ row 6, upper sign).
Therefore we get two lines in the position space.

b. e1 = (2 +

3)e2 and (e1 + e2)e3 (cid:54)= 0: By inspecting L and A1A2 in a similar

way as done in very detail in item (a) we get the following solutions:

: In this case all legs intersect again a line and therefore they

i. z = − 4e2e3√

belong to a singular linear line complex (⇒ row 7, upper sign).

c. e1 = (2 −

3)e2 and (e1 + e2)e3 (cid:54)= 0: Exactly the same computations as in
item (b) yield the solutions given in the rows 7, 8, and 9, but now for the
lower signs.

3. e0 = −e3 (cid:54)= 0: This is the same discussion as in item (2). The resulting solutions
are given in the rows 4, 5 and 6, but now for the lower signs, and in the rows 10,
11 and 12 (upper and lower signs).

General case

We start by solving Q = 0 for z which yields Eq. 7. The denominator vanishes only
for the special cases (1a), (1b), (2) and (3), respectively. We insert this expression for
z into L = 0 and A1A2 = 0 and consider the greatest common divisor of the resulting
numerators, which reads as follows:

(e0e1 + e2e3)(e2

If one of these two factors vanish we get the solutions given in the rows 17 and
18, respectively. The remaining factor of L has 40 terms and is linear in x. As the
coefﬁcient of x equals

2(e2

2 + e2

1)(e0 − e3)(e0 + e3)(e0e1 − e2e3)(e0e2 + e1e3)

(17)

we have to distinguish the following three cases:

1. e0e1 − e2e3 = 0: If one of the ei’s is equal to zero, this equation implies that also
a second one has to vanish. Therefore we get one of the already discussed spe-
cial cases (1a,b,c,d). As a consequence we can set e0 = e2e3
. Then the numerator
e1
of L simpliﬁes to

3(e1 − e2)(e1 + e2)(e2
e4

2 + e2

1)3(2e2e2

1 − ye1 + 2e2e2

3).

(18)

As e1 = ±e2 implies e0 = ±e3 we can only end up with a case studied in the
special case (2) and (3), respectively. Therefore we only remain with 2e2e2
1 −
ye1 + 2e2e2

3 = 0 which implies row 19.

2. e0e2 + e1e3 = 0: For the same reasons as in item (1) of the general case we can
3 +

. Analogous considerations imply the condition 2e1e2

2 − 2e1e2

set e0 = − e1e3
e2
ye2 = 0 resulting in row 20.

3. (e0e1 − e2e3)(e0e2 + e1e3) (cid:54)= 0: In this case we can solve L = 0 for x. Plugging
the resulting expression into A1A2 yields two factors, which are linear in y. They
imply the solutions given in row 21 and 22, which are illustrated in Fig. 6.

End of all cases.
