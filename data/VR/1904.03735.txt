Abstract—Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) systems are
emerging technologies requiring data rates of multiple Gbps.
Existing high quality VR headsets require connections through
HDMI cables to a computer rendering rich graphic contents to
meet the extremely high data transfer rate requirement. Such
a cable connection limits the VR user’s mobility and interferes
with the VR experience. Current wireless technologies such as
WiFi cannot support the multi-Gbps graphics data transfer.
Instead, we propose to use visible light communication (VLC)
for establishing high speed wireless links between a rendering
computer and a VR headset. But, VLC transceivers are highly
directional with narrow beams and require constant maintenance
of line-of-sight (LOS) alignment between the transmitter and the
receiver. Thus, we present a novel multi-detector hemispherical
VR headset design to tackle the beam misalignment problem
caused by the VR user’s random head orientation. We provide
detailed analysis on how the number of detectors on the headset
can be minimized while maintaining the required beam alignment
and providing high quality VR experience.

I. INTRODUCTION

VR/AR systems have become exceedingly popular recently
by enabling new immersive digital experiences. The appli-
cation areas of VR/AR is not only limited to gaming and
entertainment, but also education and training, environmental
and weather sciences, disaster relief, and healthcare [1, 2].
The tremendous potential of VR/AR systems has resulted
in accelerated market growth and is expected to reach $120
billion by the year 2022 [3]. However, high quality VR systems
like Oculus Rift [4] and HTC Vive [5] render the rich graphics
content on a powerful computer. Such systems require HDMI
and USB cable connections between the computer and the VR
headset for transferring the multi-Gbps data. These cables limit
the VR user’s mobility, deteriorate his quality of experience,
and present potential tripping/neck injury hazards. Standalone
VR systems like Samsung Gear [6] or Google Daydream [7]
render the graphics contents on the VR headset or on a smart
phone. Although these systems are wireless, the rendering
quality is limited by the capability of the headset or the
phone. Existing wireless technologies, such as WiFi, cannot
provide the high data rates required by high quality VR
systems. Streaming 360◦ VR videos over them is even more

constraining, due to the even higher data rate demand of such
real remote scene multi-perspective immersion content [8–10].
Hence, academic and industry researchers are considering
alternative wireless technologies, e.g., mmWave, to support
multi-Gbps data rates. However, [11] estimates that in the near
future, the VR headsets will render life-like experiences and
the required data transfer rate will exceed 1 Tbps. Supporting
such high throughput wireless links will be extremely chal-
lenging even for mmWave systems. Thus, we explore the use
of VLC to enable high speed wireless VR systems.

Optical wireless communication (OWC) has the potential to
provide optical-level wireless communication speeds. It uses
the unlicensed optical spectrum and mostly uses the same basic
optoelectronic technology as ﬁber optic communications. A
highly useful feature of OWC is its inherent signal security
due to the containment of optical wireless signals behind
walls and their low probability of interception and detection
[12]. Also,
the high directionality of OWC provides high
spatial reuse and larger network capacity. VLC is a subset
of the OWC technology that operates in the visible light
spectrum band between 400-800 THz. In the recent years,
VLC has attracted signiﬁcant research interest due to the
development of light-emitting-diode or LED technology which
can provide both illumination and high speed wireless data
transfer simultaneously [13]. LEDs are anticipated to dominate
the illumination market by 2020 [14]. Since VLC allows

 
 
 
 
 
 
both illumination and communication at the same time, it
has attracted several indoor and outdoor applications such as
lighting infrastructure in buildings with building-to-building
wireless communication, high speed data transfer between
autonomous cars, high speed communication inside ofﬁces,
houses, airplane cabins, and even in VR arenas. However, due
to the high directionality, VLC requires line-of-sight (LOS)
alignment between transmitter and receiver beams, which
becomes challenging especially in mobile scenarios.

In this paper, we present an optimized headset design
for a VLC based VR system. We consider an indoor VR-
arena (Fig. 1) where multiple LED transmitters are deployed
to create a network of multiple small cells, a.k.a. optical
attocells [15]. This network provides simultaneous high speed
wireless connectivity to multiple VR-users situated at any
location inside the arena. Moreover, such a network of multiple
cells can help maintain wireless connectivity when a VR-
user is in motion. We also consider that the VR-headset has
a hemispherical helmet/cap and is equipped with multiple
photo-detectors (PDs) placed over the cap’s surface (Fig. 2).
The proposed multi-detector design helps maintain wireless
connectivity during random headset orientation caused by the
VR-user’s head movement. We provide detailed analysis on
how choosing the appropriate number of PDs with proper
ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) can provide both full link connectivity
and a high quality VR experience.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we discuss the literature on both VLC and VR. In Section
III, we present the details of the proposed VLC-enabled VR
system. We describe the VLC-channel model in Section IV and
the evaluation of the proposed system in Section V. Finally,
we conclude in Section VI.

II. RELATED WORK

Here, we ﬁrst review the state-of-the-art of VLC research.

Then, we overview existing work on wireless VR systems.

A. Visible light communication

VLC systems typically use white LEDs as transmitters. The
modulation bandwidth of such LEDs is a few MHz which
limits the transmission rate of a VLC system [16]. To achieve
the desired high speed data rate, different methods have
been proposed, such as, frequency domain equalization [17],
using optical ﬁlters, modulation techniques like orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing [18, 19], multiple-input multi-
ple output (MIMO) [20, 21], and using red-green-blue (RGB)
LEDs [22]. In [23], a data rate of 3.4 Gbps was reported which
was achieved using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)
and RGB LEDs. In [24, 25], RGB laser diodes (RGB-LDs)
were used instead of LEDs, since LDs can provide the high
modulation bandwidth of multiple GHz. It has been shown
in [26, 27] that a combination of visible RGB lasers along
with a diffuser can generate white light that has comparable
properties with white LED sources. [25] has shown that data
rates of as high as 25Gbps can be achieved using RGB-LDs.

An indoor VLC network has multiple attocells to provide
full wireless communication coverage. Inter-cell-interference
(ICI) becomes an issue in such networks due to the over-
lapping of optical transmission beams. Different approaches
have been proposed to mitigate ICI, for example, frequency
division based carrier allocation [28], a dynamic interference-
constrained sub-carrier reuse algorithm [29], and using angle
diversity receivers (ADRs). In [30], an ADR was proposed
with a hemispherical base where the PDs were placed in one or
two layers. In [31, 32], different ADR designs were presented
where the PDs are placed at a given inclination angle on the
same horizontal plane. Such ADRs can help maintain a VLC
link in stationary scenario or during yaw movement but not in
the presence of roll and/or pitch movement of the receiver. In
this paper, we present a multi-detector VR-headset design that
can provide connectivity for any orientation of the VR-user’s
head, such as, roll, pitch, and yaw (Fig. 3a).

B. Wireless virtual reality

Existing wireless VR systems like Samsung Gear or Google
Cardboard rely on smart phones and cannot process rich
graphics content. VR systems like Zotac require the user to
carry a processor unit in backpack. High quality VR systems
like Occulus Rift and HTC Vive are not wireless and requires
HDMI and USB cable connection to a computer for rendering
the rich graphic content. For providing wireless VR with
high quality, 60 GHz communication is being explored as a
possible solution. In [33], a proof-of-concept VR system with
programming capability on the headset is proposed that uses
WiGig modules for wireless connection. The authors in [34]
developed a mmWave reﬂector that helps maintain connection
with a VR-headset in the event of blockage. In [35], the
authors proposed using Free-space-optics (FSO), a.k.a. OWC
to replace the HDMI cable on a VR-headset. They proposed
a mechanical steering mechanism for both a ceiling mounted
transmitter and a receiver on the headset to maintain line-of-
sight alignment.

In this paper, we propose a VLC based VR systems where
multiple attocells are used to maintain optical wireless links
during user mobility or in presence of multiple VR-users. We
also present a VR-headset design that leverages from multiple
highly directional PDs to maintain beam alignment when the
VR-user moves his/her head in random orientations.

III. VLC-ENABLED VR SYSTEM

A. Optical attocell VR-arena network

We consider the VR-arena to be equipped with multiple
LEDs or LDs as optical transmitters which are connected to
a VR content server through ﬁber optic cables (Fig. 1). Each
optical transmitter creates a small cell or an optical attocell.
Thus, an attocell network is established that helps provide
coverage in the whole VR-arena both in terms of illumination
and high speed data transfer. Each VR-user is served by one of
the transmitters and multiple users can be served by the same
transmitter simultaneously. A user is assigned a transmitter
from which it has the shortest distance. Existing systems like

We focus on designing a VLC-enabled VR-headset that can
maintain optical links for any user head movement.

We present a VR-headset design as shown in Fig. 2,
where one PD is placed on top and the rest of the PDs
are placed at different hemispherical layers on the headset.
Considering circular shaped PDs of the same radius rP D,
the minimum angular distance between two such PDs is
Θmin = 2 × tan−1(
), where rHeadset is the radius
of the VR-headset hemisphere. Now, for an angular distance
Θd ≥ Θmin, the total number of PD layers NL = (cid:6) 90−Θd/2
(cid:7).
The angular distance between two such layers is:

rP D
rHeadset

Θz =

(cid:40) 90o

if Θd × NL > 90o
otherwise.

(1)

The top PD is placed at an inclination angle of 0o and azimuth
angle of 0o. A PD placed at the layer j has an inclination angle
of Θj = Θz × j and the number of PDs in that layer is:

Nj = (cid:6) 360o
Θd

× sin(Θj)(cid:7), j = 1, 2, ..., NL

(2)

The azimuth angle of the i-th detector on layer j is given by:

Φij =

360o
Nj

× (i − 1), i = 1, 2, ..., Nj

(3)

So, the total number of PDs on the headset for an angular
distance of θd can be determined as,

NP D = 1 +

NL(cid:88)

j=1

Nj

(4)

Let us consider that the coordinates of the top PD in vertical
orientation is (x0, y0, z0). Then, the coordinates of the i-th PD
at layer j is (xij, yij, zij). Here,

xij = x0 + rHeadset cos Θj sin Φij
yij = y0 + rHeadset sin Θj sin Φij
zij = z0 − rHeadset cos Φij

(5)

Now, if the headset’s orientation changes by RzRyRx, the
coordinates of the PD will be:

Here, Rx, Ry, and Rz are rotation matrices representing roll,

cy = cos θy, cz = cos θz, sx = sin θx, sy = sin θy, and

the HTC Vive and Occulus Rift can track the position and
head-orientation of the user. As the user moves within the
arena he/she can be switched to other transmitters for service
depending on his/her location.

B. VR-user headset orientation

Fig. 3b displays the cumulative distribution of yaw, pitch,
and roll (Fig. 3a) values of user head movement collected from
40 users watching 6 VR 360o videos [36]. We observed that
the pitch and roll values stay within -55o to 55o in 96.13%
and 99.43% of the cases respectively. The yaw values can be
anywhere between -180o and 180o.

C. Multi-detector VR-headset

We propose a hemispherical headset equipped with multiple
PDs to receive the optical signal from the LED/LD transmit-
ters. The availability of multiple PDs helps in maintaining
optical links for any orientation of the user’s headset. We
consider optical wireless links for download, and Wiﬁ for
feedback and upload activity. We also assume that the Wiﬁ link
continuously provides baseline quality VR videos for seamless
connectivity. Moreover, the receiver headset will require a
processing unit to decode the received rich graphic content.
The decoding can also be performed by ofﬂoading the task
to a nearby edge computer. Designing an efﬁcient processing
unit at the receiver side for decoding high quality VR-content
requires further exploration and is out-of-scope of this work.

B. Signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR)

As mentioned earlier, an attocell network is established in
the VR-arena to provide full communication coverage. The
overlapping of transmitter beams in such a multi-cell network
causes inter cell interference. When a receiver is located at
the overlapping area of multiple transmitter beams, it may
receive signal not only from the transmitter it is assigned to,
but also from other transmitters. The signals received from
these “other” transmitters are regarded as interference.

The proposed VR-headset design consists of multiple PDs.
So, signals received by all the PDs on a headset are combined
to produce the resultant signal. We consider three diversity
combining techniques, equal-gain-combining (EGC), select-
gain-combining (SBC), and maximal-ratio-combining (MRC)
[30, 31, 37].

In EGC, the signals received from all the PDs are simply
added with equal weights and the resulting SINR can be
determined as:

Fig. 4: Irradiance and incident angle between an LED and PD.

IV. VLC CHANNEL MODEL

A. Received signal power

We consider a line-of-sight (LOS) optical channel and
assume that
the LED lighting has a Lambertian radiation
pattern [16]. Now, if the number of LED/LD transmitters in the
VR-arena is NLED and if a headset has NP D photo-detectors,
then the received power P r
mn at the n-th (n = 1, 2, ..., NP D)
PD from the m-th (m = 1, 2, ..., NLED) transmitter is:

mn = P t

where P t
n is the transmitted optical power of an LED, ml =
log(2)/log(cosΨ) is the order of Lambertian emission with Ψ
being the LED divergence angle, AP D is the area of a PD,
dmn is the distance between LED m and PD n, φmn is the
irradiance angle, ψ, is the incident angle, and Ts(ψ) is the ﬁlter
transmission. Here, g(ψ) and β are the optical concentrator
gain and FOV respectively, and g(ψmn) = η2/sin2(β),
where η is the refractive index. Now, if the m-th LED’s
coordinates are (xm, ym, zm) and the n-th PD’s coordinates
are (xn, yn, zn), the irradiance angle is given by (Fig. 4):

φmn = tan−1 ||−→uφ × −→vφ||
−→uφ.−→vφ
where, −→uφ = [0, 0, zm], and −→vφ = [xm −xn, ym −yn, zm −zn].
And, the incident angle is given by:

V. SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

We performed MATLAB simulations to optimize the VR-
headset design and evaluate its performance in a VLC-enabled
VR-arena with dimensions of 5m × 5m × 3m. We consider
the VR-user’s height to be 1.33m. The VR-arena is equipped
with four LED/LD transmitters placed at coordinates (1.25,
1.25, 3), (1.25, 3.75, 3), (3.75, 1.25, 3), and (3.75, 3.75, 3),
considering that the units of coordinates are in meters. Table
I provides the rest of the simulation parameters.

A. Ensuring full connectivity

We consider that all the PDs have the same half-angle FOV
βo. For a given angular distance between two PDs Θd, the
FOV should be chosen in such a way that an optical link
between an LED/LD transmitter and the headset receiver is

Fig. 5: Required α ≥ 1.5 for full VLC connectivity

maintained for any orientation of the user’s head. Let us
assume that a headset can be oriented in Norientaion ways
through different combination of yaw, pitch, and roll values.
Now, if the optical link between a transmitter and a headset is
active for N α
up different orientations, the connectivity provided
by that headset is cvgα = (N α
up/Norientaion) × 100%, where
α = 2β/Θd. If the αmin is the minimum value of α for which
cvgα = 100%, then, α ≥ αmin.

We ﬁrst conducted simulations by considering a VR-user
located at position (1.25, 1.25, 1.33) and LED-1 was the
corresponding transmitter. We changed the VR-headset’s roll
and pitch values between −90o and +90o, and yaw values
between 0o and +359o in increments of 1o. So, Norientaion =
181 × 181 × 360. The FOV was calculated from the relation
α = F OV /Θd or 2β/Θd. Fig. 5 displays the percentage of
time an optical link is active between the transmitter and the
receiver for Norientaion different orientations of the headset.
We can observe that for almost all different angular distances
(Θd = 15o, 20o, 30o, 40o, 60o) between the PDs on the
headset, 100% connectivity is achieved for any orientation
when α ≥ 1.5. So, αmin = 1.5 and thus, F OV ≥ 1.5 × Θd.

B. Optimum value of α

The value of α should be chosen in such a way that not
only full connectivity between a transmitter and a receiver is
achieved but also a high SINR is maintained. Thus, the desired
value of α should be, αopt = arg maxα SIN R(α).

We performed numerical analysis using α ≥ αmin for
different values of angular distance Θd to determine αopt.
We considered three different diversity combining techniques,
EGC, MRC, and SBC for calculating the SINR at the VR-
headset receiver. We considered 121 users located uniformly in
the VR-arena. We observed in Section III-B that the pitch and
roll values stay within −55o to 55o in 96.13% and 99.43% of
the time respectively. So, in the simulations we considered roll
and pitch values between −60o to 60o and yaw values between
−180o to 180o. Fig. 6 displays the average SINR values for

(c) Θd = 30o

(d) Θd = 40o

Fig. 6: Average SINR achieved using different diversity com-
bining techniques (with 95% conﬁdence interval)

Fig. 7: Higher SINR achieved using larger number of PDs

EGC, MRC, and SBC. We can observe that in all cases the
SINR decreases with increase in α and the average SINR is
maximum when α = 1.5. We can also see that for MRC and
SBC, the SINR values are well above the required value of
20dB [34] for VR applications. But, the achieved SINR values
can be very poor for EGC since the signals received by all the
PDs are added with equal weight.

C. Appropriate number of photo-detectors

In this section, we look at how the number of PDs on the
headset relates to the SINR achieved using MRC and SBC
techniques at the VR-headset receiver. We do not consider
EGC because it cannot provide the required SINR of 20dB for
VR applications. We calculate the number of detectors NP D
from (4), considering θd = 15o, 20o, 30o, 40o, 60o, αmin =
1.5, and FOV = αmin × θd. We can observe from Fig. 7 that,
achieving higher SINR values requires larger number of PDs.
For example, at least 20 PDs are required to attain SINR of
50dB and more than 100 PDs are required to achieve SINR of
more than 60dB. We observe sufﬁcient SINR≥20dB even for
smaller number of PDs since FOV is selected as αmin × θd
to ensure 100% connectivity for any head orientation.

As shown in Table I, we considered the LED modulation
bandwidth B = 10MHz. Thus, the achieved SINR values yields
data rates between 50-60 Mbps. As discussed earlier, recent

white light that has comparable properties with white LED
sources. The modulation bandwidth of such RGB-LDs can
be multiple GHz and hence can provide multi-Gbps data rate
while maintaining SINR ≥ 20dB for θd < 60o.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed the application of VLC for
high quality video transfer in a VR-arena. Multiple LED/LD
transmitters can be deployed in such an arena to establish
optical attocells to provide service to multiple mobile VR-
users. We presented the design of a multi-detector VR-headset
that can provide optical link connectivity for any random
head orientation. We provided simulation analysis on how an
optimal placement of the PDs on the headset can help achieve
the desired SINR values, thus high quality VR experience. We
only considered the effect of the LOS component of the VLC
channel in this work. We will consider the non-line-of-sight
(NLOS) components in our future work. We plan to develop
a proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed VR-headset and
perform test-bed experiments to assess its performance.
