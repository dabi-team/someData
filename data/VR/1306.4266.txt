In a recent article, Yefsah et al. [Nature 499, 426 (2013)] report the observation of an unusual excitation
in an elongated harmonically trapped unitary Fermi gas. After phase imprinting a domain wall,
they observe oscillations almost an order of magnitude slower than predicted by any theory of
domain walls which they interpret as a “heavy soliton” of inertial mass some 200 times larger than
the free fermion mass or 50 times larger than expected for a domain wall. We present compelling
evidence that this “soliton” is instead a quantized vortex ring by showing that the main aspects of the
experiment can be naturally explained within the framework of time-dependent superﬂuid density
functional theories (dfts).

Collective modes in the form of topological and

dynamical defects – solitons, vortices, vortex
rings, etc. – embody the emergence of non-trivial
collective dynamics from microscopic degrees of free-
dom, and provide a challenge for many-body theories
from cold atoms through electronic superconductors to
nuclei and neutron stars. The unitary Fermi gas (ufg)
provides an ideal strongly interacting system for mea-
suring and testing collective modes where controlled ex-
periments and theoretical techniques are starting to con-
verge [2]. A handful of predicted collective modes have
been directly observed, including collective oscillations
of harmonically trapped gases [3, 4], higher-nodal col-
lective modes [5], scissor modes [3], quantized vortices
and vortex lattices [6], shock waves [7], and phonons
(speed of sound [8], critical velocity [9], and ﬁrst and
second sound [5, 10]). Other modes, such as the Higgs
mode [11, 12], vortex rings [13], and domain walls [14–
18], have been demonstrated in simulations, but await
direct observation. In this paper, we discuss the objects
observed in [1]: they interpret these as “heavy solitons”;
we show them to be vortex rings.

Experimental Puzzle: Slowly moving “solitons” The re-
cent mit experiment [1] measures a slowly moving “soli-
ton” produced by a sharp spatially delineated phase
imprint on an ultracold cloud of some 105 6
Li atoms in
an elongated harmonic trap. These “solitons” cannot be
resolved in situ, but appear after a speciﬁc time-of-ﬂight
expansion procedure of that includes a rapid ramp of the
interaction strength which is controlled through a Fesh-
bach resonance by an external magnetic ﬁeld. In particu-
lar they note that a certain minimum ﬁeld Bmin < 700 G
is required to resolve the “solitons” (discussed in their
supplementary material). From the images, they extract

the period of oscillation, and ﬁnd that it increases as the
inverse trap aspect ratio 1/λ and the magnetic ﬁeld B
are increased. Increasing the temperature, they observe
“anti-dampening” whereby the amplitude of the oscil-
lation increases with time. The authors interpret these
results as the observation of a “heavy soliton” with a
mass “more than 50 times larger than the theoretically
predicted value” and “200 times their bare mass.”

Topological objects in the BEC-BCS crossover Superﬂu-
ids are characterized by a complex-valued order parame-
ter Ψ that describes the condensate wavefunction in Bose-
Einstein condensates (becs) and the Cooper pair con-
densate in fermionic Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (bcs)
superﬂuids. The superﬂuid ground state picks a co-
herence overall phase of the complex order parameter,
spontaneously breaking the original U(1) phase symme-
try of the theory. Sound waves manifest as ﬂuctuations
in this coherent phase (phonons or Nambu-Goldstone
modes). Landau’s original argument for 4He superﬂu-
idity posits a kinematical critical ﬂow velocity vc below
which neither pair-breaking nor sound excitations can
be generated. This argument is spoiled by the genera-
tion of topologically stable excitations that can nucleate
at the edge of the ﬂuid, lowering the vc. The dynamics
of these topological excitations and their interactions are
at the heart of quantum turbulence studies [19].

The single-valued order parameter admits several
topologically stable objects in three dimensions. Domain
walls separate regions of different phases while vortices
correspond to the phase winding around a line along
which the order parameter vanishes. In bosonic theories
(bec limit), the number density n
|Ψ|2 vanishes in the
core of vortices and in stationary domain walls, giving
these objects a “negative mass.” For fermions, while the

complex order parameter has a similar behavior, the re-
|Ψ|2 breaks down, with the interpretation
lationship n
that the core of the topological defects are ﬁlled with
“normal” ﬂuid, but at unitarity the number density de-
pletion is still substantial [13, 20, 21]. A manifestation of
this negative mass is that the amplitude of oscillation in
a trap will increase as energy is lost. This “anti-damping”
is seen in the experiment [1].

Domain walls (often referred to as solitons) are topo-
logically stable in one dimension. Their thickness is
set by the coherence length lcoh and thus have a nega-
tive effective mass (−MDW) due to the density depletion

FR2m is much larger than the mass m of a sin-

gle fermion. In quantum mechanics, the dynamics of
heavy objects is generally well approximated by classical
equations of motion. For domain walls, both kinetic and
potential energies are localized on the wall, thus the
same mass MDW enters both the kinetic and potential
terms and one expects the oscillation period T to be
comparable to the natural axial period Tz of the trap-
ping potential. This is conﬁrmed in bec experiments [22]
√2Tz and by fermionic simulations [14] where

This estimate (1b) gives only an order of magnitude
estimate:
the dynamics of a vortex ring in a ﬁnite
trap is somewhat more complicated but can be qual-
itatively understood. Each element of the ring will expe-
rience an outward buoyant force (cid:126)FB

(cid:126)κ will thus adjust
the velocity (cid:126)v with two components: one counter to (cid:126)vs

and another that causes the ring to expand and contract
near the ends of the trap. The velocity (cid:126)vs is the super-
ﬂow induced by the phase winding of the rest of the
vortex ring on the element, and is parallel to the z-axis
of the trap. In the middle of the trap z
0, small rings
(R much less than the trap waist R⊥) will experience
little buoyant force and the motion will be dominated
by (cid:126)v
(cid:126)vs. Larger rings, however, will have a smaller
(cid:126)vs and larger (cid:126)FB: at a critical radius Rc, the Magnus
effect will cancel (cid:126)vs and the ring will remain stationary.
Larger rings R > Rc will crawl backwards along the trap.
Near the ends of the trap, the buoyant force will also
cause the rings to expand at one end and contract at the
other. Thus a vortex ring may oscillate along the trap as
observed in bosons [26].

“Heavy solitons” are indeed vortex rings While a quan-
titative discussion requires a more complete analysis
along the lines of [27] or direct simulation as we shall
present in a moment, the order of magnitude of the effect
can be estimated from Eq. (1b) which is approximately
valid for small vortex rings near the middle of the trap
0. For the experimental parameters, small rings
z
0.2R⊥ (rings with this radius have roughly the same
R
amplitude as the oscillations seen in the experiment)
exhibit periods an order of magnitude larger than Tz,
naturally explaining the observations. Furthermore, as
the system is brought into the bec regime, the coherence
length lcoh grows signiﬁcantly relative to the ﬁxed ring
size R, so T naturally becomes smaller, approaching Tz.
Finally, in the extreme bec limit, lcoh approaches the
width of the trap, arresting the snake instability, and

Method To explain more subtle features of the ex-
periment, like the observed dependence on aspect ratio,
we perform dynamical simulations of trapped unitary
fermions using two formulations of density functional
theory (dft). The ﬁrst, an extended Thomas-Fermi
(etf) model [28], is essentially a bosonic theory for the
dimer/Cooper-pair wavefunction Ψ. The dynamics are
described by a non-linear Schrödinger equation (nlseq)
similar to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (gpe) for bosons

where arguments (cid:126)x and t have been suppressed, n =
2|Ψ|2 is the fermion number density, and Eh(n, a) is the
energy-density of the homogeneous gas with density n
and (adjustable) scattering length a ﬁt to the equation-
of-state in the bec-bcs crossover. This simpliﬁed dft is
equivalent to zero-temperature quantum hydrodynam-
ics (including the so called quantum pressure term),
and we shall use this to model the time-of-ﬂight ex-
pansion/imaging procedure of the experiment. While
computationally attractive, this formulation has some

physical drawbacks. In particular, it models only the
superﬂuid portion of the cloud: physics associated with
the normal state is missing. As a result, a vanishing
order parameter Ψ = 0 implies a vanishing density n = 0.
This tends to overestimate the density contrast in the
core of defects and leads to the same domain wall mo-
√2Tz as the harmonically trapped gpe. There is
tion T
also no mechanism for the superﬂuid to transfer energy
to the normal component, which inhibits the relaxation
of rotating systems into a regular vortex lattice, and pre-
vents Eq. (2) from being used to simulate the preparation
of the experiment as the initial sound waves generated
by the phase imprint never dampen, and the generated
vortex rings rapidly decay.

≈

To address these issues, we also simulate a time-
dependent extension of dft to superﬂuid systems – the
time-dependent superﬂuid local density approximation
(tdslda) – where the dynamical evolution is described
by equations for the quasiparticle wavefunctions (uk, vk)

a self-energy contribution β and effective mass parame-

These additional terms allows the tdslda to quantita-
tively match all experimentally measured and numer-
ically calculated properties of homogeneous systems
in ﬁnite and inﬁnite boxes [30]: adjusting α, β, and γ
allows one to consistently characterize the energy per
particle, pairing gap, and quasiparticle spectrum ob-
tained from quantum Monte Carlo (qmc) calculations
of the homogeneous inﬁnite system. (Note: If α
= 1, one
must include additional terms to restore Galilean covari-
ance as discussed in [29, 31]: we avoid this complication
by setting α = 1 instead of α
1.1 while adjusting β and
≈
γ to reproduce the energy per particle and pairing gap.)
Simulating Eqs. (3) for three-dimensional systems repre-
sents a serious computational challenge that effectively
utilizes the largest supercomputers available, so we use
this only to verify that stable vortex rings are generically
produced from the phase-imprint procedure, and use
the etf (2) to model the experimental systems.

Results Following the preparation procedure out-
lined in [1], we phase imprint a domain wall on harmon-
ically trapped clouds and follow the evolution using
the tdslda. (Details are presented in [31].) For sufﬁ-
ciently large clouds, the domain wall quickly decays into

ring initially crawls along the outside of the trap and a
smaller ring bounces back. Computational limitations
restrict us to relatively small systems and these simula-
tions are quite close to the onset of the snake instability.
Nevertheless, the period seen in Fig. 1 is comparable to
our estimate Eq. (1b). Finally, we note an anti-damping
similar to that seen at higher temperatures in [1]. This is
explained by the small heat-capacity of our simulated
system: the residual sound waves induced by the phase
correspond roughly to a ﬁnite temperature.

For larger clouds we use the etf (2). As expected,
the initial preparation phase cannot be reliably repro-
duced: the sound waves generated by the imprint do not
dissipate, and the resulting vortex ring decays within

enforcing quantitative agreement would help further
constrain the tdslda functional.

The puzzle provided by the imaging procedure re-
mains: can a vortex ring look like a planar soliton after
imaging? The answer, yes, is demonstrated in Fig. 2 and
in [31]. The imaging procedure includes a rapid ramp of
the magnetic ﬁeld to the bec side of the crossover where
the coherence length becomes much larger, but the equa-
tion of state becomes softer. This rapid-ramp procedure
followed by expansion produces something akin to a
shock wave [7, 18] that manifests itself as a planar soliton
upon imaging. Our simulations conﬁrm the somewhat
subtle experimental observation that sufﬁcient ramping
below Bmin < 700 G is required to observe a signal, and
explains both the thickness of the “soliton” and the am-
plitude of the integrated density ﬂuctuations observed in
the experiment [1]. A slight difference remains between
This deﬁciency of the etf can also explain a quantitative
difference between the density fringe pattern seen in
the integrated 1d density Fig. 2 compared with those
seen in experiment [1], the latter having a minimum in
the center where the etf has a peak. As shown in the
movies of the expansion [31], this feature results from
the motion of shock-waves formed during the expansion,
the speed of which is incorrectly predicted by the etf.
We have shown that the puzzling report of “heavy
solitons” in fermionic superﬂuids [1], which appear to
exhibit an effective mass some ﬁfty times larger than
predicted by theory of dynamics of a domain wall, can
be naturally explained in terms of vortex rings. Using
a 3d simulation of the tdslda, we validate the picture
that, in large enough traps, imprinted domain walls
generically evolve into vortex rings through an axially-
symmetric “snake instability.” The estimate Eq. (1b)
shows that these rings can have large periods at unitar-
ity, that decreases toward the bec regime, and explicit
simulations using the etf verify the dependence of the
period on the aspect ratio. Finally, the etf demonstrates
that, through the expansion/imaging process employed
to resolve the objects, vortex rings manifest as large pla-
nar objects with an observable density contrast only if
the magnetic ﬁeld is ramped to Bmin < 700 G, in quan-
titative agreement with the observations. We have thus

Figure 2. (color online) Demonstration of the imaging pro-
cedure. The top plot shows a slice of the density through
the upper-half core of the trap before expansion: the vortex
ring is barely visible at z = 0. Below is a slice through the
upper-half core after ramping to Bmin = 580 G and letting the
cloud expand as discussed [1]. The lower plot shows the inte-
grated 2d density

dxdy n(x, y, z) (white curve). The lower half of the image
has added Gaussian noise with a 3% density variation and is
coarse-grained on a 3 µm scale to simulate the experimental
imaging procedure, clearly demonstrating that vortex rings
appear as solitons. (Densities are scaled by maximum value
for better contrast.) For Bmin > 700 G, the density contrast is
reduced below the experimental signal-to-noise ratio. See the
supplementary information [31] for details and for movies.

a few oscillations. Stable vortex rings can be produced,
however, by “cooling” an imprinted phase pattern with
imaginary time evolution. As shown in the supplemen-
tary information [31], these vortex rings reproduce the
qualitative behaviors observed in the mit experiment [1].
In particular, the period is an order of magnitude larger
than expected for domain walls and increases by similar
amounts as the aspect ratio is reduced as shown in Table
I. The period also scales toward the domain wall results
√2Tz toward the bec limit and exhibits anti-damping
decays in the presence of phonon excitations. (These
phonons mock up ﬂuctuations, but do not faithfully sim-
ulate a thermal ensemble.) A quantitative comparison is
marred by the lack of a normal component occupying
the core of the vortex. However, when comparing the
etf with the tdslda simulations, we ﬁnd that this is
fairly consistently characterized by an overall increase in
periods by a factor of about 1.8 – somewhat larger but
(cid:112)3/2 seen when comparing the
similar to the factor of
period of fermionic to bosonic domain walls in quasi-1d
environments. We are conﬁdent that a realistic tdslda

ing the elaborate imaging protocol, thereby validating
the use of the tdslda and etf theories for dynamical
simulations including topological defects, and resolving
the mystery of “heavy solitons” as vortex rings.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

The essential feature of the domain walls imprinted in
the experiment [1] is that they can decay via a “snake”
instability into vortex rings when the radial extent of
the trap becomes larger to the coherence length R
(cid:29)
lcoh [27, 33–35]. The formation of an axially aligned
vortex rings from a trapped domain wall is thus almost
inevitable: The center of the wall moves faster than
the edges so that the wall bows out along the axis of
the trap. If the trap is narrow, then the wall maintains
integrity (see e.g. Ref. [18]) and one will indeed observe
an oscillating domain wall, but as the trap becomes
wider, the bowing out will eventually overwhelm the
domain wall, establish a circulation, and form a vortex
ring. Pinsker et al. [36] used this idea to suggest a “piston
mechanism” for generating vortex rings, and the mit
experiment [1] essentially reproduces this setup. One
thus generically expects a phase imprint to generate
vortex rings once the width of the trap exceeds some
critical value. The detailed structure of one such a ring
from our simulations is down in Fig. 3 shows a cross-
section of the cloud.

This behaviour has been studied for bosons (see
e.g. [27, 37]), where the transition from a domain wall
to a vortex ring appears to be continuous in harmonic
tubes (see [27]). Our simulations shown in Fig. 4 suggest
that these results also apply qualitatively for fermions.
In particular, in the smallest system (left panel of Fig. 4),
the vortex ring conﬁguration exists only away from the
turning points. It collapses in on itself, re-forming as a
domain wall near the turning points and remerges as a
vortex ring with an opposite circulation. This behavior
mirrors that seen in bec [26], but is demonstrated here
for the ﬁrst time in a fermionic system. This new domain
wall exhibits the same initial instability, and a vortex ring
of the opposite circulation and similar size forms and
moves back along the trap in the opposite direction. This
oscillation is at the limit of the fermionic equivalent of
the domain-wall branch of these types of excitations [27].
Note that [27] also discusses collisions of these excita-
tions, which are elastic at low energies. Reducing the
width of the trap, one will continuously approach the
quasi-1d situation of oscillating domain walls. Note that
√3Tz in this case approximately agrees
the period T
with other the quasi-1d simulations [14, 17, 18]

≈

The motion of a vortex ring in a trapped gas will be
modiﬁed by the boundary: the outward buoyant force
of the trap, for example, will change the axial velocity of
the vortex ring according to the well established Magnus
relationship. An oscillation can occur whereby a small
vortex ring moves along the axis of a trap, primarily
according to (1a) and the longitudinal component of the
buoyant force, then returns as a larger ring crawling

along the edge of the trap (see e.g. [27, 37]). This pic-
ture follows from arguments similar to those used to
derive (1), but where the superﬂow outside the ring no-
longer extends to inﬁnity. As the boundary is reduced,
the balance shifts between the opposite ﬂows inside and
outside of the ring, slowing, then ultimately reversing
the velocity of the ring. A quantitative analysis must in-
clude effects such as the entrainment of the surrounding
ﬂuid, which can change the effective mass, etc.; see [39]
for a few idealized examples. Thus vortex rings can
naturally oscillate with periods much larger than Tz in
1/kF
traps where the size of the transverse direction R
is large.

TDSLDA Model To demonstrate the generic gener-
ation of vortex rings, we simulate the superﬂuid local
density approximation (slda) (3) on three 3d lattices
of size 24
128 with
×
unit lattice spacing. We adjust the particle number ––
about 230, 560, and 1270 particles for these lattices re-
spectively –– so that the density in the core of the initial
cylindrical trap [31, 38] corresponds to kF = 1. We evolve
about 105 wavefunctions in real time using a symplec-
tic split-operator integrator that respects time-reversal
invariance using hundreds of gpus on the Titan super-
computer [32]. Preparing initial states in 3d has been
a major challenge for superﬂuid dft like the slda, but
the quantum-friction algorithm introduced in [38] easily
overcomes this challenge, and we quickly cool into the
ground state of an elongated harmonic trap. As in the
experiment, we phase imprint a domain wall, but to
reduce phonon noise generated during the imprint, we
include a repulsive knife-edge potential. Although the
initial conditions have axial symmetry, the simulations
here are fully 3d so as not to bias the results.

The simulations evolve a formally inﬁnite system of
coupled nonlinear time-dependent pdes as described
in detail elsewhere [13, 29]. The tdslda is based on
the simplest possible energy density functional that
In addition to the

F/3π2 where the Fermi
wavevector kF = 1/δx = 1. The harmonic trapping potential along z is then increased slowly while applying the quantum cooling
algorithm described in [38] to cool the system to a state with two separated clouds. These are the phase imprinted with δφ = π
and the knife edge is removed, allowing the soliton to evolve as shown. Movies, including a case for a 48
128 lattice, may
be found in [31]. This ring then oscillates along the axis of the trap. In the smaller simulation, the ring does not fully form, and it
collapses in on itself, re-forming as a dark-soliton near the turning points. This behavior mirrors that seen in bec [26], but is
demonstrated here for the ﬁrst time in a fermionic system. This new domain wall exhibits the same initial instability, and a vortex
ring of the opposite circulation and similar size forms and moves back along the trap in the opposite direction. This oscillation is
at the limit of the fermionic equivalent of the domain-wall branch of these types of excitations [27]. Note that [27] also discusses

The gradient term proportional to local velocity (cid:126)v = (cid:126)j/n
acts like a gauge potential, and will most affect mostly
the ﬂow, barely affecting the density. The last term is
a correction to the self-energy of the particle and its
magnitude, even close to a vortex core, is very small

≈
0.004εF, since the maximum value of the velocity around
a quantized vortex core is v (cid:54) 0.2vF [20].

As with all dfts, this can be applied to an arbitrary
external one-body potential Vext((cid:126)x, t). In our ﬁrst imple-
mentation of the time-dependent GPU version of the
code we use a split operator method which requires less
RAM memory. For this method, gradient terms such
as in Eq. (6) are extremely expensive to compute. In
our simulations, we use a simpler parameterization with
α = 1 which avoids the need for the current-dependent
term on the second line of (6). This affects the quan-
titative accuracy of the theory only at the level of a
few percent, see also Fig. 5 and the discussion below

where the single-particle Hamiltonian h and pairing

tional derivatives of the energy density E. The dimen-
sionless constants α, β, and γ are ﬁxed by the energy
per particle, pairing gap and quasiparticle spectrum
obtained from qmc calculations of the homogeneous
inﬁnite system. Though Eq. (7) has a similar form as
the mean-ﬁeld BdG equations, it includes a self-energy
contribution, which is dominant even at unitarity unlike
BdG, and it includes all correlations at the same level of
accuracy as the qmc results available so far.

ETF Model To demonstrate the scaling of oscillation
periods with system size, aspect ratio, etc. we simulate
the etf model (2) in a cylindrical discrete variable rep-
resentation (dvr) basis [42] with 2048 points along the
z-axis and 256 points in the radial direction, using trap-
ping parameters as described in [1]. We phase imprint a
x2 + y2
vortex ring with phase φ = arg[z + i(r − R)] (r =
and R is the vortex ring radius) and “cool” with imagi-
nary time evolution to generate vortex rings with various
amounts of background phonon excitations. These are
then evolved in real-time using the split-operator integra-
tor to determine the oscillation period, and to perform
the rapid-ramp/expansion imaging procedure. Several
sample results are shown in Fig. 7, and summarized in
the following tables.

The etf follows from minimizing the energy-density

generation [47], vortex pinning [48], and soliton dynam-
ics [49]. The etf is equivalent to the quantum hydrody-
namics approach at zero temperature, which has been
used extensively by many authors for modelling the
unitary Fermi gas during the last decade, but etf also
includes the quantum pressure term typically neglected
in a hydrodynamic approach. We point out that the etf
in Eq. (2) is manifestly covariant under Galilean trans-
e−2iφΨ((cid:126)x + (cid:126)vt, t) where

φ = m(cid:126)v
corresponds with the identiﬁcation of Ψ =

dimer or di-fermion condensate and could be absorbed
into the deﬁnition of the dimer mass mB = 2m.

Gradient corrections The slda (4) and etf (8) func-
tionals naturally describe gradients through their kinetic
terms, but since they have been ﬁt to properties of ho-
mogeneous system, one might reasonably wonder if any
signiﬁcant gradient corrections have been overlooked.
This question was addressed in [50] by confronting high-
precision qmc calculations of harmonically trapped sys-
tems which found that, while small gradient corrections
n|2/n might improve the abil-
of Weizsäcker-type
ity of the functionals to ﬁt traps with few particles, they
can be treated as a perturbative correction to the under-
lying slda (4). Indeed, the slda performs extremely
well, even when applied to inhomogeneous trapped
systems, where it explains virtually all available qmc re-
sults for systems with up to 120 fermions, both in polar-
ized and unpolarized systems, in superﬂuid or normal
phases, in harmonic traps, periodic boxes, and inﬁnite
matter [29, 30, 51]. This indicates that the kinetic energy
vn|2 properly describes most
density τc = 2
of the gradient effects. Since the pairing is strong in the
unitary Fermi gas, this kinetic energy density includes
kF, much larger than
gradients up to high momenta
the scales ∼ kF describing solitons like domain-walls, vor-
tices, and vortex rings. Thus, though additional gradient
corrections may affect the structure of solitons, these
effects will be subtle, and will require high-precision
qmc calculations and measurements to validate. The
omission of these higher-order corrections in our simu-
lations are unlikely to affect our results more than the
quoted experimental accuracy, as also illustrated in Fig.5,
for a case where density gradients are signiﬁcant.

The available qmc calculations are not accurate
enough to provide a more exact value of the effective
mass of the quasi-particles. The qmc results of [52]
1.14 [29] obtained by calculating
suggest a value of α
the ground state energy difference |E(N
1, k) − E(N, 0)|,
where N is even and (cid:32)hk is the momentum of the system
with N
1 particles. In that calculation the Bertsch pa-
rameter was determined to be ξ = 0.42(2), thus with
an error of about 10% when compared to more re-
cent qmc results [53] and experimental measurements

ξ = 0.372 [44, 54]. One can therefore infer that the
error in the quasi-particle dispersion is much larger
as it is a difference in energies. The qmc calcula-
tion [52] for the pairing gap quotes an error of about 5%
(∆ = 0.504(24)εF). This agrees within the error bars with
an independent analysis of experimental data of polar-
ized system [55], which claims that ∆ = 0.45(5)εF. In an
independent qmc study at ﬁnite temperatures [56], the
effective mass was found to be consistent with the bare
mass to within 10% for a large range of temperatures. In
summary, all direct information from qmc calculations
and experiments contain errors at the level of about 10%,
statistical as well systematic, consistent with α − 1 (cid:54) 0.1.

Figure 5. (color online) Relative energy change (in %) between
simulations with α = 1 and α = 1.14 that compute the energy
of N fermions (both even and odd particle numbers) in the
unitary Fermi gas trapped in an isotropic harmonic oscillator.
The parameters β and γ for the SLDA here have been adjusted
to match the values of ξ and η used in Ref. [29] for ﬁxed
α = 1.14 and α = 1.00. This demonstrates that a 14% change
in α results in less than 2% change in energies, even in very
small systems which have relatively large gradients. The use
of the bare mass in dft calculations is in the spirit of original
Hohenberg and Kohn and Kohn and Sham formulation, which
is widely used in electronic calculations in condensed matter
physics and chemistry.

Results The results of the expansion and imaging pro-
cess are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 6 (see [31] for movies).
Here it becomes clear why the experiment [1] needed to
implement an involved ramping/imaging procedure to
image the defects. The rapid ramp into the bec regime
at low magnetic ﬁelds Bmin < 700 G causes a rapid
change in the coherence length that produces a sort of
shock-wave during the expansion. The geometry to the
expansion results in an asymmetric density depletion
that resolves into a planar looking object when imaged
with the coarse-grain resolution of the imaging system.
If the ﬁeld Bmin not sufﬁciently small, then the shock-
wave is mild, and the resulting cloud does not have
enough contrast to register a signal. That the etf quan-
titatively reproduces the required minimum ﬁeld Bmin
is further validation of the dft and somewhat expected
since the etf approximation should become more accu-
rate in the bec regime.

parison of the etf and slda is performed in [57].

In Table I we compared the oscillation periods pre-
dicted by the etf with the observed period from [1] on
resonance for the three aspect ratios studied in the ex-
periment. The observations are consistently larger than
the etf predictions by a factor of about 1.8: this might
be due to the lack of a normal component ﬁlling the core
of the vortices in the etf and is reminiscent of the factor
(cid:112)3/2 difference in the calculated period of 1d domain
walls. This is consistent with the heuristic estimate (1b)
whereby the mass depletion MVR would be suppressed
for fermions by the presence of the normal state.

To test the consistency of this suppression, we use the
etf to model the tdslda simulations shown in Fig. 4.
The comparison is shown in Table II where it is seen that
the tdslda periods are larger than the etf by a factor
consistent with (cid:112)3/2 for small systems. This is expected
since these simulations are in small traps and are very
close to the limit where domain walls remain stable. The

The etf certainly cannot reproduce all details of the
fermionic dynamics – in particular, one expects poor
behavior when excitations approach the pair-breaking
threshold set by the gap (cid:32)hω > 2∆
EF. The theory,
however, has the same symmetries, and is tuned to have
the same equation of state as the full theory. The ad-
vantage of this approach over traditional fermionic time-
dependent density functional theorys (tddfts) is its
computational simplicity: the bosonic approach needs
only to evolve a single wavefunction. A detailed com-

In Table III we demonstrate how the period depends
on the initial radius of the imprinted vortex ring R0. This
parameter is not directly measured or controlled in the
experiment, so we must estimate the value R0
0.2R⊥
by the resulting amplitude of oscillation ∼ 0.5Rz shown
in the ﬁgures of [1].

the Crow instability [58, 59] and the mit experiment is
poised right on the edge of the regime where one can
start to explore the quantum turbulence cascade.
