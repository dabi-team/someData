The on-shell imaginary part of the retarded selfenergy of massive ϕ4 theory in
1+1 dimensions is logarithmically infrared divergent. This leads to a zero in the
spectral function, separating its usual bump into two. The twin peaks interfere in
time-dependent correlation functions, which causes oscillating modulations on top
of exponential-like decay, while the usual formulas for the decay rate fail. We see
similar modulations in our numerical results for a mean ﬁeld correlator, using a
Hartree ensemble approximation.

In our numerical simulations of 1+1 dimensional ϕ4 theory using the Hartree
ensemble approximation 1 we found funny modulations in a time-dependent
correlation function. Fig. 1 shows such modulations on top of a roughly ex-
ponential decay. The correlation function is the time average of the zero mo-
mentum mode of the mean ﬁeld, Fmf (t) = ϕ(t)ϕ(0) − ϕ(t) ϕ(0), where the
t1 dt′ X(t + t′)/(t2 − t1), taken after
over-bar denotes a time average, X(t) =
waiting a long time t1 for the system to be in approximate equilibrium. This
equilibrium is approximately thermal and Fmf (t) is analogous to the sym-
metric correlation function of the quantum ﬁeld theory at ﬁnite temperature,
F (t) = h 1
2 { ˆϕ(t), ˆϕ(0)}iconn. A natural question is now, does F (t) also have
such modulations?

The selfenergy can be calculated in perturbation theory. The one and two
loop diagrams in the imaginary time formalism which have nontrivial energy-
momentum dependence are shown in Fig. 2. Diagrams not shown give only
rise to an eﬀective temperature dependent mass, which we assume to be the

present only in the ‘broken phase’ (for which h ˆϕi 6= 0; there is really only a
symmetric phase in 1+1 dimensions, but this is due to symmetry restoration by
nonperturbative eﬀects which will not obliterate the one-loop damping.) The
corresponding selfenergy has been calculated in 2, for example. It only leads to
0 > 4m2, which are irrelevant for the quasiparticle
damping for frequencies p2
0 = m2. So from now on we concentrate on the two-loop diagram.

two terms, Σ1 + Σ2 (see e.g. 3). The ﬁrst has an imaginary part corresponding
to 1 ↔ 3 processes requiring p2

Now the usual deﬁnition of the thermal plasmon damping rate (at zero

momentum) in terms of the retarded selfenergy,

γ = −Im Σ(m)/2m,

(4)

leads to a divergent answer (a collinear divergence). A natural way out of this
diﬃculty may be to continue the selfenergy analytically into the lower half
of its second Riemann sheet, p0 → m − iγ, and replace (4) by the improved
deﬁnition

m2 − (m − iγ)2 + Σ(m − iγ) = 0.
(5)
The analytic continuation of the selfenergy into the region Im p0 < 0 poses the
puzzle how to deal with the logarithmic branch point coming from the collinear
singularity at p0 = m. However, the ambiguity is present only in the real part
of Σ. For weak coupling λ/m2 ≪ 1 we get from (5) the equation

The constant c has to be determined by matching a numerical evaluation of Σ
to the logarithmic singularity at p0 = m.

We evaluated Σ2 in (3) for T = m by numerical integration with ǫ/m =
0.02, 0.01 and linear extrapolation ǫ → 0, giving c ≈ −0.51. For example, Eq.
(6) now gives γ/m = 0.061, for λ/m2 = 0.4.

To see how well this γ describes the decay of the correlator F (t) we eval-
uated this function directly from (1) and (2). The divergence in Im Σ(p0) at
p0 = m leads to a zero in the spectral function ρ(p0). So is there a peak at
all in ρ(p0)? Fig. 3 shows what happens: the ‘usual’ peak has separated into
two twins! Fig. 4 shows the resulting F (t). The eﬀect of the double peak is

3

indeed an oscillating modulation on top of the roughly exponential decay. The
decay corresponding to exp(−γt), with γ given by (6), is also indicated in the
plot: it does not do a good job in describing the average decay beyond the ﬁrst
interference minimum. The ‘Twin Peaks’ phenomenon implies that the usual
deﬁnition of damping rate (5) is unreliable in 1+1 dimensions.
